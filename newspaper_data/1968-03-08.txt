-Details of Lab 
Explosion Revealed 

The details of the explosion, 
which blackened an AMES labora-
tory early Wednesday morning, 
are beginning to materialize as 
investigations into the incident 
continue. 

At approximately 6:30 a.m. on Wednesday mo.rning an explosion ripped apart an AMES lab, com-
pletely destroying its contents . Damage has been estimated at $25 .000. 

Dr. Stanford S. Penner, chair-
man of the AMES Department, 
said that the powerful explOSion 
was probably caused by a mal-
function in an experiment relat-
-ing to radiation properties of 
heated water. A thermostat, 
which was supposed to keep the 
oil bath in a vat at more than 
100 degrees C. probably broke , 
causing a heating rod to fail. As 
the temperature rose, gas fumes 
filled the lab in Urey Hall, room 
5102 and a spark probably trig-
ge red the explosion. 

"Accidents associated with 

Muir Visitation Rules Revised 
malfunction of oil-heating baths 
are rare occurrences," Penner 
said. The chances were quoted 
as "one in ten-thousand". 

o one was near the lab when 
the explosion occurred at about 
6:35 a.m. Wednesday. A janitor, 
who had checked the area two 
hours earlier, said everything 
had been normal. 

The final, formal Muir college 
visitation policy proposed by the 
Muir resident students was pre-
sented to the Provost last Tues-
day for his consider tion. The 
policy ano the regulations ano 
enforcement sections wer,~ writ-
ten by the Provtsional Govern-
me nt's visitation commltt-?r !\:'\d 
the whole was approved by the 
students. The Provost, in whom 
lies the final authority to ap-
prove the policy, is reading the 
proposal and will submit it, with 
the changes he feels necessary, to 
the students for final adoption. 
The poliCy as it was presented 
calls for guidp.-line hours of 
11 to 12 p.m. on week niglits, 
and til 2:30 on week-ends. These 
hours are subject to change by 
the individual suites of the resi-
dence halls and the enforcement 
of the hours is also required of 
the suite. The justification of the 
policy, which was based on the

Two Deaths Strike 
U C S D Campus 

Two deaths stirred the UCSD 
community last weekend. On fri-
day evening Cleveland H. Davls, 
a Marine Facllity Captain for 
Scripps lnsititue ofOceanogr!lphy 
was pronounced dead from can-
cer at St. John's Hospital in 
Santa Mooica. 

On Sunday afternoon, a twenty-
year old airman, First Class, 
Dean Schmid , drowned in heavy 
ocean current just south of 
Scripps pier on the lower cam-
pus . Schmid was visiting his 
cousin Gary Schmer, a physical 
education teacher at UCSD. 

In recognition of Scripps' loss 
of Davis, the school flags were 
nown at half-mast on Monday,

part of the proposal says visi-
tation would end the artificially 
restricted cond ition now existing 
and "nurture and enhance" the 
proposed character of John Muir 
College .•• The "suites rights" 
concept, as it has been called, 
is based on the contention that 
the suites are " the smallest 
cohesive units in the resident 
community", and as such should 
determine their own hours. A 
tremendous amount of work has 

gone into the proposal, work that 
began at the heginning of the 
year and has involved many 
people. Provost Stewart said he 
was very impressed with the pro-
posal and that it is a matter of 
highest importance to him. 

The obvious feature of the 
proposal is the fact that it al-
lows the suites to adopt 24 hour 
visitation if all the members of 
the suite approve, a possibility 
with large implications on sever-.

the door of the thirty foot square 
room was blown out to the heavy

of shape, and then it fell five 
stories to the ground. At the 
same time the room's windows 
were shattered sending flying

Budget Cuts May Affect Enrollment 
The Re gents of the Univer-

sity of California ha ve reaffirmed 
their request tor a $311 million 
operating budget for the next 
fisical year. They insist that this 
amount is necessary to meet the 
needs of the expected enrollment 
without comprimising quality in 
teaching or research. 

At the same time, the Regents 
directed President Charles J. 
Hitch to provide them next month 
with a "full report on the h~ve l 
of enrollment possible within a 
budget of $280 milllon, and in 
the interim (to) take no action 
to accept students beyond that 
enrollment figure." 

Hitch told the Regents that 
quick "back of the envelope cal-
culations" led him to conclude 
that UC would have to reduce 
its expected enrollment by about 
7,000 full-time students to op-
erate within the $280 million 
budget proposed by governor Re-
agan. Hitch later told a press 
conference,"I would be very re-
lunctant to limit enrollment. It 
will be a bad day for California 
when we have to do so." 

Hitch told the Regents that their 

budget request was no more than 
adequate. He said the proposal 
to cut new faculty positions from 
474 to 121 was "in many res-
pects the most serious aspects" 
of the Governor' s budget. Hitch 
explained that the 121 new pro-
fessors cou ld not in fact be 

hired because the Governor had 
not included an adequate alIo-
wance for normal merit salary 
increases and promotions in his 
budget.

UC Conduct Standards 
Issued . For Students 

New standarris of. conduct have 
been issued fo r students ami 
student organizations at the Uni-
versity of California, President 
Charles J. Hitch annollDced last 
week. 

Th revisions, effective im-
m di t Iy, are in accord with 
th Council of the American As-
sociation of University ProCes-
sors and the United States Na-
tional Student Association. Their 
joint statement on "rights and 
freedoms of students" h called 
for regulations to be "as clearly 
defined as possible." 

The UC presid nt noted that 
the amendment sought to "define 

more precise Iy the meaning of 
standards of condnc and is a 
clarification r thpr than change 
of University policy." He said 
the new d !loition had bepo r9-
vieweo with thE' ChancE'llors of 
th nin UC campuses and that 
all wer~ in agreement Wlrl it. 

The text of the am nd'llent

minutes after the incident.

(OSA Suggests 
Revelle Changes 

The Revelle College Commit-
tee on Student Affairs (COSA ) 
made recommendations this week 
for a college government in the 

fi~st college. 
Included in the proposals are 

committees dealing with student 
conduct, college activities and 
educational policy. 

According to Tom Hull, Revelle 
Dean of Students and a spokes-
man for COSA. the new govern-
ment would be based on students, 
both undergraduate and graduate, 
faculty, and staff. "The common 
meeting ground." Hull said, 
"would be the scholar." Student 
and faculty representatives would 
be able to work together in de-
veloping all aspects of the College 
and generally to promote commu-
nication between students and 
faculty. 

Unlike typical student govern-
m nt, CO A's government would 
seek to deal directly with im-
portant matters facing the col-
lege. "Since it would be ad-
visory to the Provost, who has 
the real power at the college 
level," Hull said, " this govern-
ment could be much more force-
ful than the usual student coun-
cil.' , 

COSA enVIsions a "college

Times Encourages 
Student Dialogue 

Throughout this last academic year the students of UCSD have been 
exposed to a situation which is unique within the UC system. Instead 
of the conventio:Jal school newspaper to report news and other events 
of interest this campus has officially supported two campus news-
papers with two different points of view. Until now this two newspaper 
system has enabled students at UCSD to read a campus publication 
every week. Last week, however, the Communications Board of UCSD 
voted a measure into the bylaws limiting the campus' support to only 
one student enterprise in each communications media. 

Seemingly this would cause a terrible rilt between the two com.-
peting campus newspapers but recent developments have allayed thIS 
possibllty. Already in a 'state of "receivership", the "Indicator" 
has been officially declared defunct under its present management. 
While the "Times" has maintained itself financially and has grown 
in many ways with the publication of each is~ue. t~e Communi~tions 
Board feels it is time that a IdicotomYI of Vlewpomts and a vanation 
of platforms hold equal representation under one masth.~ad.. . " 

With this conviction a meeting of the staffs of the Tnton TImes 
and the last year's i'Indicator" will take place early in the Spring 
quarter. Hopefully a reconcilliation of the editorial philosophies of 
both papers will produce a publlcation which stands as an open. forum 
for student opinion. The "Times" is anxious to cooperate in this ven-
ture so long blocked by personal vendettas and a lack of communication 
and cooperation between the papers. Through this cooperative etfort l 
we hope that UCSD will be able to match its academic excellence with 
a dynamic and representative student voice. 

·University. Values Must 
Enter Political Arena 

In deCiance of Governor Reagan, Univer sity of California Regents 
have taken a much s tronger stand than ever before--although not 
nearly strong enough- -in reaffirming the necessity to maintain quality 
at the University, even to the extent of limiting enrolIme~t if n.eces~ary. 

Calilornia's residents have always supported the UOlverslty, fman-
cially and ethically. Yet in Riverside this week the Governor spoke 
of the financial hardship of the most affluent state in the nation and of 
the "top priority" he gave the University in this year's budget alloca-
tions. 

We and mos~ other newspapers throughout the state, haVp. pointed 
out the importance or the Univ~rsity. We have pointed out that it is , , 
despite the Governor's protestations, possible for the State to finance 
quality higher education adequately. 

AU of us have failed to influence the Reagan Administration. 
It is now the responsibility of students to, quite literally, stump 

the State to gain support from the people for the University. Only if it 
becomes pOlitically disasterous for Republicans as well as Democrats 
not to oppose Reagan on this issue will the Unive r sity be able to 
maintain its present status. 

For some time now it has been recogni:ed that the University cannot 
keep itself out of the political arena. This ideal of political aloofness 
has been shattered by Corces, led by the Gove rnor, who see, any state 
supported institution which encourages dissent and open mmdedness 
as a threat to the conservative values which assure their ascendence in 
society. . . 

But his dissent this questioning ot the values that the current admlOJ-
stration wishes to halt, must continue. And the proper plaCE! fol' this 
is the University. 

We urge the Associated Student, the University Admini<;tratlon, the 
Regents, and the people of this statt:! to bring the values ot the Univer-
sity into the political arena now. 

The values of the University are the values that we promised when 
this country was founded. They must be preserved.

I .. 'etters ,to the Editor 
Opera Jericho 
Says Down with 
Peoples'Walls 
Editor, Triton Times: 

As an avid reader of both t~e 
Times and the Indicator, I want 
to first or all commend you for 
your news worthy coverage of 
campus events. You have also 
lv:.m most generous in allotting 
space to the programs of our 
Agape student group and Uni-
versity Luthe ran Church, and for 
this we are grateful. 

However, I also feel constrained 
to register a word of protest for 
your complaint department. The 
pictorial article captioned 
"Booth Debates Popkin" in the 
Feb. 23 issue of the Times was 
in error on two counts. Jerry 
Popkin specifically requested 
that his picture not be publishp.d, 
to which the photographer agreed. 
It was also stressed repeatedly 
throughout the programs that this 
exchange between a represent-
ative of the Students of the In-
dependant Left and the Young 
Republicans was not intended to 
be a debate, but a dialog. The 
following definition was cited, 
which was proposed by Milan 
Machovec, a Marxist , from the 
philosophy department at Charles 
University in Prague: 

"Dialog is the encounter olin-
di viduals or groups in which there 
is a complete opening up of each 
one toward the other. Dialog is 
more than an exchange of infor-
mation and ideas: it is existen-
tial interaction. Dialog is es-
sential to human life in the same 
wayasfreshair,food,friendship, 
and work. One conditon of dialog 
is the willingness and courage to 
open up - to reveal not only 
my strengths, but also my weak-
nesses. Another is interest -
concrete interest - in the weifare 
of one's partne r. Still anothe r is 
abandon of power; the use of , 
power and dialog are mutually 
exclusive. Man can and must 
teel responsibility for the weUare 
of his partner in dialog. If (Re-
flections on Protest: Student Pre-
sence in Political Conflict, edited

Press, pp 128). 
In brief, the goal of our "Op-

eration Jericho" series is to 
break dowo walls between people, 
to move from diatribe to dialog. 
Yours for smashing walls and 
intergrlty in journalism,

Grad Students Defend Harvey 
Editor, Triton Times: 

This resolution was unanimou-
Iy passed at a recent meeting 
of graduate students in the Lit-
erature Department at UCSD: 

We . the graduate students of 
the Department of Literature, 
believe that any member of the 
university community has the 
right and the duty to express 
himself 00 matters ot national 
importance. We arl~ deeply dis-
turbed that the chairman of this 
department, Dr. Roy Harvey 
Pearce, has been asked to 

, apologize for taking a recent 
action which in effect criticized 

the war in Viet- Nam. We be-
lieve that the university is a 
santuary for all ideas, and that 
any member of the unlversl!y 
community should not be askp.d 
to apologize for expressing 
ideas which his conscience dic-
tates. We applaud the chairman, 
other members of this depart-
ment, and members of other 
departments at UCSD for taking 
a stand on this important issue 
and fully support their right 
to say what they think. 

Respectfully submitted,

John Mishler Announce~ 
Ca ndidacy for A.S. Presidency 
Editor, the Triton Times: 

Who is to blame for the state 
of affairs which now persists on 
the campus of the University of 
California at San Diego? The 
Triton Times places the blame 
solely on the members of the 
student body government. Can 
we, the innocent student body 
accuse them without considering 
other facts relevant to the mat-
ter at hand? True, the student 
government has not tried to en-
courage student participation in 
government proceedings or the 
planning of activities , but along 
these same lines, the paper must 
gather some of the neglect for 
promoting the reporting of these 
affairs. We, as non-interested 
students, should also be blamed 
for our petty non- involvment in 
the affairs of this University. 
Is there a remedy for this "fine 
kettle of fish?" 

I now take the opportunity to 
announce my candidacy for the 
presidency of the Associated Stu-
dent Body. What can I do? Very 
little without the support of the 
student body, and how does one 
do the impossible? By getting 
s tudents informed and interested. 
I propose to LnUiate the "Old 
Town Meetlngs," once every 
wet:!k, with a member of the 
administration, a TrUon Times · 
reporter, and myself to dtscuss 
important matters concernlngthe 
welfare of the students. This 
type of activity would give the 

administaration much needed 
feed back in planning their rules 
and regulations, which affect the 
students as a whole. Working 
with the paper, I would promote 
the establishment of weekly co-
lumns by senate members, ex-
pressing their views on school 
policies. 

We, the students , must accept 
and promote a pride in UCSD. 
This pride is only established 
through hard work and patience, 
Let us work Cor a better uni-
versity. 

Thank you , John Mishler

Harris Speaks on Selective Service 
David Har ris, ex-president of 

the Stanfortl University student 
body, spoke on "The Selective 
Service and Non-Random Dis-
sent" on Tuesday, February 20, 
in the Undergraduate Science 
Building. 

Harris , under indictment for 
refusal of induction, stated that 
the Selective Service System 
teaches us to live our lives in 
the context of fear. He claimed 
that mos t people in the world 
are living in misery, and that 
the Ame'rican military is an in-
strument of that misery. The 
American military, according to 
Harris, includes not only those 
who carry guns, but also those 
who carry draft car1s. 

Asserting that we cannlltserve 
two gods, Harris slated that if 
you are going to se rve the god 
oC conscription, you can't serve 
anything else. If you will serve 
humanity, you can't serve con-
·scription. "A merican society is 
the negation of humanity," 

Continuing on the subject of 
world misery and the instru-
mentality of the American mili-
tary, Harris stated: "The way to 
stop oppression is to stop being 
an oppressor. II He later said 
that we must realize that we 
are the invadl3rs around the 
world. 

The sum of Harris' presenta-
tion was a request to students 
to join in resistance to the Selec-
tive Service System in the manner 
in which Harris himself has done. 

A question-and-answer period 
followed Harris' brief delivery, 
and a substantial amount of time 
was devoted to the question of 
whether it is better to go to jail 
over resistance or whether one 
should join the army and work 
from the inside in stirring up 
resistanr.e. Harris' primaryar-
gument agaInst submitting to in-
duction was that one doesn't abol-

ish a system by becoming a 
part of it. ReSistance, he re-
marked, should be from the out-
side, in order to stop the now 
of men into military service and 
to encourage servicemen to re-
fuse ordp.rs, the latter having 
already resulted in a number of 
A WOL soldiers in San Francisco. 

Lowell Bergman commented 

that you can't do much good from 
a jail cell. Harris stated that 
what is important is the work 
done from the time one returns 
his draft card to the time one 
enters jail. The object, according 
to Harris, is to leavt:! two people 
in your place to continue the 
work while you are in prison, 
thus starting a geometriC pro-
greSSion.

A strange administrative pol-

icy concerning the rent of the 
residence halls during the quar-
ter breaks has occasioned a lit-
tle unhappiness among some for -
eign students. The usual rate for 
an outsider to stay in the resi-
dence halls is $2 per night, while 
over X'mas and Spring break it 
is $3 per night. (this oC course 
does not include meals). When 
the resident dean was asked tor 
the reasons, the following argu-

" He's 
always crutching 
his Security Bank 

savings book." 

" You can't blame 
him. By now he's 
saved. enough to 
buy an island." 

ments were given: 
1. "We want to discourage the 

students from staying in the 
dorms during breaks." 

2. "It is a source of income." 
3. "The complete , staff has to 

maintain the halls and the 
extra do Ilar he Ips cove r 
these expensees. II 

4."We are doing a favor to the 
foreign students by allowing 
them to stay on campus." 

The last point was made in 
reply to an observation by one 
of us -- Chetan Mehta -- that 
some foreign students indeed re-
cognize this gesture as discrim-
inatory .against for eign students. 
This is in consequence to the 
Cact that it ls generally only the 
foreign students who do not have 
an alternative place of residence 
and thus become victims of this 
policy. 

We hope that in the interest 
of International friendship this 
letter r eceives due attention.

ted on his view of Negro humor. 

Professor at USC and cur-
rently teaching History 36 at 
UCSD, Dr. Baskin began the 
evening by saying that in the 
beginning "the Negro was not 
allowed to read or write, and il 
he did was severely punished. 
As a result, Negro humor had 
to be passed on by oral tra-
dition. Today, Negroes satirize 
the way in which the y had to 
laugh at the white man. " One 
method was to "go OV'.lr to the 
laughing box and laugh in it and 
then close it" or another "to 
laugh into an envelope, seal it, 
and then mail it." , 

Dr. Baskin proceeded to dis-
cuss the controversy of the Negro 
stereotype - the "SamOO". 

"U. B. Phlllips," stated the 
professor, "firmly believed tha 
the Negro was inferior and a slow 
dull-witted lazy child." In con-
trast , "Stanley Elkins believed 
that the Sambo existed in the 
same way as prisoners in the 
Nazi concentration camps where 
men do bec,)me children. In the 
same way, slavery was a closed 
concentration camp." 

"But," Dr . Boskin asserted, 
"the Sambo was really a con-
trived figur~ . Slav'lry was a very 
oppressive system and the Negro 
naturally devised the Sambo i.n 
order to devise ways of getting 
out of labor. The master would 
ask the slave to go get a hoe 
and the slave would return with 
a rope, or for a rope, the slave 
would return with a horse. Com-
bine these actions and the fact 
that his language was extremely 
infantile and unintelligible, and 
it is evident. why the Negro slave 
wa.;; not punished for jis 'Samba' 
character, but sympathized w[' h. 
and occasionally r <!l ieved from 
his work. and allowpd to go to 
sleep like a baby 'Jnder a tree." 

"In another instance" added 
Dr. Baskin, "the Negro wOlJlj 
say to his maRter ' I'm going to 
steal away '0 Jesus' . By this, 
the slave meant he was going to 
a secret meeting with his friends, 
while the master 'hO'jbil~ !'Ie wa<; 

~i.l1g to Chur ,;il." 
"Using humor", the professor 

emphasized, "tbe Ne~) became 
a Samho, in order to get 3.rolJnd 
the white and avoid a whipping." 

Illus trating this fact, Dr. Bos-
kin stated: 

"The Negro comes upon his 
master's turkey dinner, and be-
cause he was very hungry, he 
ate it. The master comes along 
then and finding his dinner gone, 
asks the slave ' W1Jat happened 
to my dinner?' Th 3 slave an-

like '[ eight ut mas:>a'. Com-
pletely astonished, the master 
leave" tile slave to teU his neigh-
bors what happened, and in this 
way, the slave avoids a whip-
ping." 

"Beforo'! 1950" Dr. Boskinpro-
gressed, "Negro bumo:- was 
ma.'l.ilested as an in-grown humor 
against themse lves." Elabor-
ating, he gave an example: 

"A white hen laid a black egg 
and they hung her." 

"FreqIlPntly", emphasized Dr. 
Boskin. "the jokes inclined to the 
macabre. A NE!~r(} cl {it worker is 
found misSing, the lake is dredg-
ed and his bOOy is found com __ 
pletely cove red with iron and 
chains. Upon seeing the body, 
the sheriff states: " it appears 
as if he took from the hardware 
store a little mori! than he could 
handle". 

"By 1960, the Samba stereo-
type started to die," obse rved 
the proCessor. "Negroes openly 
satirized tile Samba ste reotype 
and man!:' it clear ~'lat they lead 
universal lives like everybody 
else. In addition, the Negr'Jes 
made cLear what they thought of 
the way whites live." "The re 
suIt," he stated, "was racial 
humo;" and role reversal jokes. 
"In his jokes, the Negro made 
the white theSamboand the fool." 

"The elevation of humor," Dr. 
Baskin concluded, "is of utmost 
necessity in order that national 

balan~e anf! harmony be main-
tained, that society remain heal-
thy, that prejudice be combatted. 
Without humor-whether Negro or 
humor in general-neither the Ne-
gro nor anybody can survive."

The grant is a renewal of a 
$33,291 grant which was made 
last year tc UCSD for recata-
loging volumes in the San Diego 
Medical Society- University Li-
brary. Medical Library Resource 
grants are awarded by the United 
States Surgeon General to public, 
and private non-profit institu-
tions for the purpose of expand-
ing and improving their basic 
medical library and related re-
sources. This year institutions 
received only five-sixths of the 
amount they received the pre-
vious year. 

Earth Sciences 
Offers C OU rses 

The question of the status of 
the Earth Sciences major has 
been investigated by a committee ' 
headed by Dr. Arnold and several 
recommendations have been 
made. An undergraduate major 
in the Earth Sciences has been 
offered for two years, the pro-
gram being handled by Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography. 

Because of several problems, 
the major was recently dissolved; 
faculty members remaining with 
Scripps. As Arnold described it, 
the reasons for doing so were 
basically two. First. Scripps con-
centrates on graduate study and 
research in this area, and it was 
dillicult to provide sufficient un-
dergraduate instruction. Also, 
the general trend among other 
institutions has been to move 
away from undergraduate work 
in the Earth Sciences. 

However, it was feIt that there 
was sufficient interest in both 
the Earth Sciences and Oceano-
graphy that students should not 
have to wait until graduate school 
to be exposed to these fields. 
According to the committee's 
recommendation, a student could 
major in a related subject, usual-
ly Physics, Chemistry, Biology, 
or AMES, but take six courses 
at Scripps in the Earth Sciences 
(or Oceanography). Details will 
be worked out, but the major pro-
grams will probably be mod.ilied 
to allow students to take this 
option.

Robert Lewis, Biomedical Li-
brarian at UCSD, will direct the 
use of the 1968 grant monies. 
which will be used primarily to 
prepare a caialog in book form 
of all volumes in the San Diego 
Medical Society-University Li-
brary. The Library, housed at 
the University Hospital, is ad- ' 
ministered by the UCSD Bio-
medical Library and serves the 
teaching hospital and the 1400 
members of the San Diego Coun-
ty Medical SOCiety. 

Lewis aid "This year's grant 
enables us to move ahead with 
the important project of improv-
ing resources for our medical 
libraries. When completed, the 
project will benefit medical prac-
titioners , biomedical research 
agencies and medical libraries 

throughout the San Diego area" 
This year, tbe library opera-

tions both at the hospital and on 
the UCSD campus will benefit 
from the grant, Lewis said. The 
book catalog, which will be a 
computer print-out by author, 
title and subject at the 15,000 
volumes at the hospital, will be 
available to medical libraries 
and clinics, as well as individual 
physicians in San Diego County. 

Lewis said 25 per cent of the 
grant this year will be used to 
purchase books for the Biomedi-
cal Library on campus. "With 
the opening of our medical school 
less than a year a way, it is vital 
for us to acquire materials which 
will supplement and augment our 
program." 

Blacks Struggle for Liberation 
Need White Understanding 

The black peopie in America 
form a part of a liberation strug-
gle which includes blacks 
throughout the world,James For-
man told a large audience in the 
Humanities Library last week. 

Forman described black 
Americans as "acolonial people 
in the United States." While there 
are poor whites who are exploited 
by the ruling class, only the 
blacks are colonized. Forman 
said that the ruling class con-
sisted of leaders of government 
and managers of the economy, 
and he ridiculed any who thought 
that they actually had a say in 
their government.

Part of the struggle, said For-
man, is to prevent the United 
States from committing genocide 
against the black people. He used 
the Vietnam War and sterilization 
programs as evIdence of this 
intent. 

However, he said, we "are not 
going to play Jews." Forman 
said that attempt.s are being made 
to kill black leaders in order to 
weaken the people. 

The only way the racist prob-
lem in the United States is going 
to be solved suggested Forman, 
is by having individual whites 
make the decision, not by trying 
to work with the nebulous major-
ity. 

To accomplish this there must 
be an anti-racist policy in the 
white community. This is what 
is meant by "civilizing the white 
community" •

UCSD Holds Meet 
The UCSD Tritons held tbelr 

(irst meet of the season on our 
track Saturday, March 2. The 
whole team had been looking for-
ward to this meet for several 
reasons. Not only is Cal Western 
a cross-town rival, but the ath-
letes assembled at this meet were 
probably the stiffest competition 
we have to face in the regular 
season. Unfortunately several of 
our key men were out witb in-
juries after the fir st running 
event, and tbe team thE'r"!tore 
lost many crucial points. It is 
hoped that both Phil Cunnjngham 
and Steve Gartolo will be back 
In top shape for the next meet 
against La Verne on Mar'!h 23. 

Captain Dave Kuhn, having a 
rather rough day, came through 
with a good 22.8 for third place 
in the 220. Tom Wolle, the team's 
kon man, came through with a 
first In the long jump (22'9") 
and a third in t.he 100. Marc 
Rothman added his points for the 
day by plaCing third in the 440, 
willie Tom Gatlin, one at the 

new members of the track team, 
grabbed a much needed second 
in the 440 intermediate hllrdl'ls. 
other point sCl)r~ rs for the day 
were Garfolo in the javelin, Bill 
Dowe r in the p!)le vault, and 
Jerry Nerengarten in the 120 
high hurdles. 

The mile relay team, normal-
ly composed of Tom Gatlin, Dave 
Kuhn, Phil Cunningham, and Marc 
Rothman ran a poor third with-
out the much needed Cunningham. 

Arter the relatively good show-
ing by several of the above men-
tioned individuals, Coach J obnson 
says be Is not too worried about 
the season ahead. According to 
Mr. Johnson all the team needs 
is some re-shuffling of its ath-
letes into the proper events, so 
that each man will have enough 
rest in between events. Wben 
this is done then the team will 
be able to rely on all and not 
just a Cew. Here's hoping our 
team comes through wltbanother 
successful season.

Ending the season with a 14

hp. Triton's most outstanding 

team member. On top of his 
fine record, freshman Wilson 
added to his laurels with a 1st 
place in the Biola Invitational 
Tournament held at the end of 
February. 

Pictured above are UCSD's varsity (dark sweatclothes) and junior 
varsity basketball teams, both of which corr.pleted successful seasons 
against Cal Western, Biola and other hardcore teams in California. 

The most exciting game of the 
season for the Triton cagers 
came in an-after-the-season ex-
hibition game with the South Kor-
ean Olympic Basketball team. 
The Tritons lost by 11, but it 
took a double overtime to beat 
the Tritons. Basketball Season 

Ends ~vith UCSD Win 
Starting slowly, both teams 

began to buUd up steam. Ten 
minutes into play saw UCSD be-
hind 14-21. It looked like UCSD 
would s~ay seven behind as at 
the hal! the score stood 37-44. 
But the Tritons had other plans. 
It took San Kiego five minutes 
to tie tbe score at 48 all with 
heads-up ball control. With the 
score seesawing, Flatley sunk 
a pair of charity tosses with 17 
seconds left, setting the score 
75-73. However, Ingun Kim s hot 
with four showing and put the 
contest into overtime. 

The 1967-68 basketball season 
has finall y drawn to a close. 
Playing a 24 game schedule, the 
Triton cage stars managed a 10 
win, 14 loss record in regular 
play. 

Opening against Biola, the Tri-
tons looked headed for an out-
standing season with a 102-78 
tally. However, as the season 
progressed, and the competition 
became much greater, the Tri-
tons lost a few. 

In tournament play UCSD found 
themselves at Biola for t!lree, 
winning the Consolation brackett 
after dropping the first game 
to La Verne by four, 82-86.

Coach Neale Stoner next led 
the Tritons over Southern Cal 
Colle~ 74-71 at the La Verne 
tournament, losing the next night 
in a ve r y fast game to Stanislaus 
State 95-105. That game saw 
the Tritons in double figures. The 
last tournament for the Tritons 
was the UCR ClaSSiC, where in 
the first game a great last min-
ute effort came 3 points short 
of upsetting Davis. The next night

Bill Flatly sunk 19 to lead the

UCSD~ Donation Received 
Faculty to for Medical Ubrary 
Have a Ball 

The Third Annual Faculty Ball, 
Saturday, March 16 at 9: 30 pm 
to 1:30 am in the Revelle College 
Commons will be a benefit tor 
the Students' Special Opportuni-
ties Scholarship Fund on the San 
Diego Campus. 

Donation of $500 to develop a 
research library in the Cardio-
vascular Division of the Depart-
ment of Medicine at the Univer-
sity of Calitornia. San Diego, 
was recently announced by Chan-
cellar John S. Galbraith. 

Although undergoing a long 
series of brain, lung and heart 
operations and illnesses. he was 
graduated in 1961 from Waukon 
High School where he played in 
the band, lettered in golf, and 
was active in speech, dramatics 
and operettas. He attended the 
University of California, Ber-
keley, and Contra Costa College 
betore enrolling at Cal Poly. 

1750 invitations went out to 
various community groups as 
well as to academic and admin-
istrative staff and members of 
the Chancellor's Club and Honor-
ary Alumni. 

The United States of America sent sounds of electronics out over 
the Matthews Residence Quad to a rapt audience on Friday. March 1. 

The gift was arranged by Mr. 
and Mr. Dale R. Robey of Waukon, 
la.. In .memory of their son, 
Theron, who died Aug. 20, 1967, 
at the age of 24 of a congenital 
heart defect. Presentation was 
made to Dr. Nina S. Braunwald 
of the National Institutes of 
Health, who will assume duties 
in June with the UCSD Depart-
ment of Medicine. 

In making the donation Mrs. 
Robey said, •• A number of rela-
tives and others who watched 
Theron's gallant struggle for 
something more than life gave 
memorials that we might give 
to research directed specifically 
at this heart-lung problem. Most 
of the research we read about is 
being done for circulatory de-
fects that strike adults, who. 
after all, had some years of 
normal activity . There is a ter-
rible grief and frustration in 
seeing someone who never had a 
chance to realize his potential 
as an adult. It is our hope--as 
it would have been Theron's--
that this gift will be helpful to 
the investigators working in the 
cardiovascular unit attempting to 
solve problems oC the pulmonary 
hypertension that disabled him 
and eventually led to his death." 

Music will be provided by Vic 
Vincent's Orchestra. During in- ' 
termlssion. entertainment will 
be provided by Dr. John Stewart 
Provost of the Second College 
plus five others who call them-
selves the Mouldy Figs. Members 
ot the group include: 0 r. Ste wart 
(trumpet), Dr. James Campbell 
(piano), Professor Donald Lewal-
len (string bass), ProfessorJohn 
SUber (trombone). Earl Schuster 
(clarinet and sax), and Richard 
Silberman (percussion). Dr. 
Stewart predicts there will be a 
grand surprise when a "myster-
ious Broadway personality" ap-
pears during intermission for 
some singing numbers with the 
Mouldy Figs . 

Beauty a nd Beast to be 
Chosen by Students In accepting the gift Dr. Braun-

wald noted the proposed library 
wUl be named in honor of Theron 
Robey and added that "it will be 
of Invaluable help in furthe ring 
work which hopefully wlU lead to 
the solution of some of the prob-
lems relating to the dread com-
plications at pulmo:Jary hyper-
tension." 

Best wishes to two newly en-
gaged juniors. Cathy Topping and 
Stephanie Santos.

V;ve la France! 
Bv Kathy Benson and Cathy Merrill 

(Editor's note: This is the tirst installment of Vive la France received 
by the Triton Times. This column will appear periodically in the Times 
depending on the regularity of the overseas mail service. The next 
installment will deal with the hotels and schools in Paris).) 

We had never before realized how beautiful the lights at San Diego 
are-but, from an alrplane, at night, the city is really pretty. But then, 
we even thought Washington, at 6:00 a.m., was beautiful! 

We spent a day and a half in Washington (that is the place to buy 
clothes. girls). Then on to New York. At 9:00 that night we took off 
for Europe. 

It was an exhausting (11 hours) and nauseous (bad weather) filght. 
It was even more sick-making for most of the other passengers 
when Icelandic Airlines provided their patrons with ap.~:~its for two 
hOU1 ; , and followed this with a dinner of wine with a complementary 
serv:.1g of cognac. A poor American girl a few seats ahead of us was, 
un!or: unately, completely overwhelmed by this custom. She, with two 
otJ1,~: girls, was making her grand tour and seemed determined to 
live up L . ~l not surpass. the image (not too favorable) of the American 
girl a )road. After the Cirst round oC cocktailS, we were treated to a 
consbu·· \J; rrage ot hysterical giggling accompanied by incompre-
hensible witiclsms. This progressed in volume throughout dinner. 

Th~n, 4f ~r the cognac, she stood on her seat, slyly contemplating 
two ~t.!'~ctlve Eur,>pean men in the seats behind her, who were. I 
might <.fl·: vastly amused. Encouraged by their laughter, she cleverly 
recl:Jl ?'l her seat so she could climb over and join them - needless 
to s«.>·, 7 : ~'!y became ev~n more amused. The other people in the 
plf\!l:{ " turned around to watCh - it was much better than the movie. 
(Anofl . .: I ')ai'Sy Miller?) 

The flight was supposed to stop at Iceland, but the airport there was 
snowed in, so we went to Glasgow Scotland to retuel. From there our 
flight plan took us to Luxe mbonrg. The fastest and cheapest flight is 
.from New York to Luxembourg - $167 during the winter, $205 during 
the summer. one way. From Luxembourg to Paris, the bus only costs 
$7 and it is a relatively short (5 hours), but very scenic route. We 
were lucky, though, for there were three other passengers on the bus -
American girls also bound for Paris - so the trip wasn't boring (we 
talked the whole time). Then at midnight on Sunday, we arrived in 
Paris. That was really a terrible time to arrive at our first hotel. 

The concierge took one look at our matching navy blue coat£ (which 
the French associate with "pensionaires" and Catholic schools) and 
said we weren't the type to stay in his "pas gentil" hotel. He then 
carried our luggage down the street to a more respectable esta.bUsh-
ment. One tip: don·t take much luggage or you'll feel more inclined 
to grab the first hotel you tind. So we ended up moving into a nice 
hotel for $2 apiece. It took us 'almost a week to completely adjust to 
the time difference and recuperate from our trip ov~r. Also, tor you 
people planning to come over with "Europe on $5 a day", every estab-
lishment mentioned in it has raised its prices at least 10%.

"In Cold Blood" Provokes Thought 
Richard Brooks' film of Tru-

man Capote's "In Cold Blood" 
harrowingly analyzes the brutal, 
profitless murder of the prosper-
ous Clutter family in 1959 which 
has become the most celebrated 
single crime in recent American 
history. It emerges as a wor.k or 
great power and realism, and is 
gruesome and thought-provoking. 

However, don't be led to believe 
that the film is a failure. Quite 
the contrary, it is exceptionally 
well-done. The original story is 
followed with remarkable fidelity 
with scrupulous attention to au-
thenticity--the murde rs are even 
tilmed In the rooms where they 

occured. The structure of the 
story Is masterful. Brooks takes 
us to the point at which the killers 
are poised outside the far mhouse, 
then cuts to the discov (! ry of 
the slaughter. Much later in the 
film we are given the ransacking 
and murders in flashback which 
are admirably handled in re-
straint. Robert Blake and Scott 
Wilson as the killers are ex-
cellent 

It is the Clutters ' unsuspecting, 
God-fearing normality Which 
madp. their deaths particularly 
horrifying. Brooks displays the 
arrogance oC the marauders and 
their lury when they find there 

is no expected hoard of money. 
a demo:lstration at how the case 
was broken on very few clues and 
some extraordinary luck, and the 
grisly sce nes of the killers' 
long wait in prison and even ual 
execution. The film develops into 
a statement against capitol 
punishment. 

The rich black and white pho-
tography. documentar y style. and 

v~ry fine musical score all con-
tribute to the quality oC the film. 
It is a work that will not be 
widely appreciated, but is an 
honest, riveting. sobering look 
at the r oots and nowering of 
crime. 

Can Yon Study 
at the rate 

Of 800 wpm? 
Over 9.5% of our graduates have increased 
their reading speed at least three 
times - with good comprehension. 

btternationally famous E1:elyn Wood Reading Dynamics Institute 
invites you to a free demonstration. 
• You will see a Reading Dynamics graduate read at amating 

speeds from a book he has never seen before and then tell 
in detail what he has read. 

• You will see a documented film that includes actual inter-
views with Washington Congre~smen who have taken the 
course. 

• You will learn how we can help you to foster read ing, im-

McCarthy's 
Campaign 
Is Growing 
Gerald Hill, Statewide chair-

man of the McCarthy for Presl-
dent committee, appealed for 
support for his candidate in what 
he termed "probably the last' 
opportunity to change the policies 
of the present administration." 
Hill, currently president. olCDC, 
the California Democratic Coun-
cil, spoke to about 200 people at 
Muirlands Jr. High School in 
La Jolla. 

Hill felt that "the growing cor-
ruption of the national spirit has 
alienated many, especially the 
young people, from political and 
social life; our country is not 
offering to young people what we 
have claimed it traditionally 
stands for." 

"in spite of this corruption of 
values at the highest levels It he 
continued, "many rem ain shent, 
pleading political survival." 
However, he claimed that Sena-
tor McCarthy wa~ not one of 
those wl}o are afraid to speak Ollt. 
Despite tremenrlous pressures 
from the Johnson machine, Mc-
Carthy is dflterminfld to remain 
in the race all the way to provide 
the voters with an alternative to 
LBJ. 

As it turned out, Hill's speech 
was more a criticism of LBJ 
than an endorsement of McCar-
thy. Johnson was labeled "the 
epitomy of the milltary-indus-
trial complex." Hill said, "I am 
coming to believe that my more 
rad ' cal friends are right - the 
whole system must be turnfld 
arouQd. We are not just involved 
in a political campaign; we are 
involved in one of the most seri-
ous political struggles since the 
Civil War." 

As lor the progress of the 
McCarthy campaign , Hillis quite 
optimistic. Operations are now 
proceeding at a national leve 1. 
McCarthy will enter all major 
primaries, whereas President 
Johnson has refused to enter his 
name on any primary ballot. The 
crucial test will be in CaliCornia, 
where McCarthy will face a slate 
of Johnson-pledged delegates led 
by State Attorney-General Lynch. 
Hill proclaim'ld, "We are in this 
race all the way."

The Disco-Dance held last Saturday night at the barnDoor gave the 
participants their fill of musiC, mini-skrts and beer. 

Disco-Dance Sports 
Minis and Beer Slurp 

The second Disco Dance, held 
last Saturday at the Coffee Hut, 
proved quite successful. The af-
fair, complete with plenty of 
music, contests and Cancy equip-
ment, was sponsored by the AS 
und~r the direction of Don Bright 
and Jon Collins. Most of the 
evening, the D,J.'s entertained 
the crowd by playing lots of 
popular music, taking requests 
and holding way-out contests . 

From 9: 30 - lO:30, The Ice, 
an L.A. based band, performed. 
Their extremely loud volume 
which initially attracted a larg~ 
crowed, eventually ended in dis-
persing more than hall of the 
students to the safety of their 
dorms. 

The highlight of the evening, 
however, was the long-awaited, 
well-publicized, beer chugging 
contest. Due to the tremendolfs 
response to this contest heats 
had to be held. In the first run, 
Jac Crawford pipped out a field 
of eight other "chuggers" to 
win his heat. in the second heat 
the predicted winner, Dan Koenig, 
eaSily downed his glass well 
ahead of the other six contenders. 
Jac and Dan then went into the 
finals where they were required 
to pour down their throats two 
successive beers. Jac pulled 
ahead on the first glass, but Dan 
swallowed his pride, made a tre-
mendous second effort and came 

~RF. 
\ 

through with a tie b'lfore an 
amazed crowd. Both contestants 
then immediately retreated to 
the woods Cor amoment of pri-
vacy before receiving their 
prizes. 

Even though the dance was 
well attended, the weather kept 
many students from staying too 
long. To those who missed the 
fantastic beer chugging contest, 
held late in the evening, don't 
worry. Next quarter could bring 
another Disco Dance with more 
musiC, prizes, and, of course , 
lots of beer.

"Right You Are" Probes

opening Thursday (March 7) a

The identity of a young woman

a small Italian village is con-
fronted with the dilemma of the 
uncertaintity of truth. 

A young civil service worker

for his mother-in-law, but WOll't

UCSB Faculty 
Denounces 
Protestors 

By over whelming vote, the Ca-
cuIty of the University of Cali-
fornia at Santa Barbara has ap-
proved a resolution deploring 
disruptive tactics of student de-
monstration. 

Clayton Wilson, professor of 
music and chai rman of the San-
ta Barbara division of the UC 
Academic Senate, said the re-
solution • 'distingllished sharply 
between dissent and disruption. 
The resolution deplored disrup-
tive tactics, whether by the use 
of torce or through de liberate 
violation of reasonable ru les. 
Disruptive tactics, it said, must 
be delt with fairl y but tirmly, 
Such tactics unde rmine the rights 
of others and threaten the wel-
fare of tpe university, 

"ll rules are inadequate, then 
the issues involved should be de-
bated and the neces sary changes 
made through orderly procedure, 
the resolution indicated. It urged 
continuing public support of aca-
demic freedom and university 
autonomy," Wilson said. 

ployers and their wives, he ex-
plains his fir st wife died in a 
recent earthq'lake, though her 
mother has never accepted her 
death. When he re-married, she 
believed the gir l to be her own 
daughter. The husband indicates 
his mother- in- law has lost her 
sense of the rea lity and refuses 
to accept the truth. He admits 
she is insane. 

The mother-in-law convin-
cingly elCplains to her concerned 
neighbors that her son-in- law 
was formerly in an asylum af er 
a mental breakdown. When her 
daughter was brought before him 
during his recovery, he refused 
to recogni ze he r as his wife . He 
believed her to be dead. To ease 
his mind, a wedding ceremony 
was re-staged and therefore he 
thinks she is his second wife 
and not the mother-in- Iaw's 
daughter, 

Each is reconciled with the fact 
the olf!er relates a diUerent un-
derstanding of the truth. It is 
the involvement and curiosity of 
the townspeople who have as-
serted their influence that cre-
ates the dramatic upheaval. 

Marian Pettigrew and Robert 
Larsen will play the leadlng roles 
of the mother- in-la..... and the 
young husband. Carnell Kirkeeng 
will portray a pivotal role as he 
intensively questions the partici -
pants to solve the mystery sur-
rounding the true identity of the 
wife.

Editor's note: Unfortunately, due to the absence of some professors in-
volved in the ~llring quarter Humanities course , this compilation has been 
delayed until now. While pre-registration bas already enrolled most students 

Human.ities 3 
Dr. Piero Ariotti has a Ph.D. 

in Philosophy of Science and is 
an Assistant ProCessor of Phi-
losophy. 

Dr. Ariotti considers an under-
standing of the history of western 
literature and thoughts impor-
tant. He will show how major 
changes in western science can 
be traced through a history of 
science which is an integral part 
of history. 

He will lecture on biology, 
astronomy and physics and on 
major philosophical develop-
ments after Aristotle. He also Ur. Piero Ariotti 
wants to teach St. Augustine and 
develop an understanding of the New Testament. 

Dr. Ariotti will not look for absorption of information, but rather 
an insight into the concepts of our heritage as well as critical ability 
of students. 

His booklpst: Vergil" Aeneid"; Tacitus "The Anals of Imperial 
Rome"; Saunders "Greek and Roman Philosophy after Aristotle"; 
st. Augustine "The Confessions", trans. Rex Warner; Koestler "The 
Sleepwalkers"; Dante "The Divine Comedy", H. R. Huse trans. 

Father Ben Hunt will be teaching the "staff" Humanities course. 
He has a Ph.D. from the Catholic Unive rsity in medieval philosophy, 
and is a Paulist Father. 

Reverand Hunt is coming to UCSD next quarter from St. Paul's College 
which is a part of the Catholic University in Washington D.C., where 
he has been teaching since 1948. Reverend Hunt is presently De~n of 
St. Paul's and head of the philosophy department there. He has wntten 
articles for the Newman Review and been a book reviewer for the 
Catholic News. 

Father Mort of UCSD describes Hunt as a speculative man who 
enjoys teaching in an intuitive method. Fat.her ~unt is a .creatlve 
teacher whose interests range over the enllre held of phllosophy. 
Father' Hunt will also teach an upper division philosophy section. 

His booklist: Virgile, "Aneld"; Tacitus, "The Annals of Imperial 
Rome'" Lucritius " ature of the Universe"; St. Augustine, "City 
of God,,; Cid, «Poem of the Cid"; "Portable Medieval Reader"; 
Dante, "The Divine Comedy". 

Dr. Edward Peters said that 
he intends to stress the two 
dimensions of Humanities -- the 
deve lopment of ideas and their 
meaning in their own context. 

Professor Peters graduated 
from Yale Unive rsity with his 
Ph. D. in Medieval studies. In 
his five years as a teacher, 
he has taught English, Humanities 
and History. Presently he is doing 
research into the hlstoryofideas 
and how they apply to consti-
tulons and laws. 

His lectures will be based on 
reading text and will not be overly

Dr. MartiI' W ierschen said that 
the Humanit'es must be well in-
tegrated bet veen philosophy and 
history. He (id not think it effec-
tive to stres; one field above the 
other. 

He said tI at the T A should oe 
more than just a reader, but 
should contirlue the job of teach-
ing. 

The Hum mities program, he 
felt, is impJrtant in introdUCing 
the student to deve lopment of 
Western Civilization. He wasn't 
sure that the beginning student 
had enough background to decide Dr. ~a rtin Wiers chen 
on a more specific course. Be-
cause of this, the program was a necessity despite the fact that it might 
be too broad.

terature, McGill University, 
Montreal, 1962; M.A., UCLA; 
currently working for doctorate; 
teaching experience; UCSD 1967-
68; Humanities 6, 1:00 - 1:50. 

Professor Cohen's main field 
of interest is philosophy and li-
terary criticism. He originally 
came to this country from France 
and stated that literary criticism 
is especially dynamic there 
today. 

Cohen will emphasize the "dia-
lectics of freedom" in his lec-
tu res, and try to reach Ita kind 
of Marcusian ideal." He felt that ~r. Alain Cohen , M.A. 

the 19th century encompasses mu<:h, but that he would choose some of 
the more significant example s, such as Hegel, Marx, and Sartre. 

His bookUst; Hegel "Selections", ed. Jacob Loewenberg; Marx 
& Engles "Basic Writings On Politics & Philosophy", ed. L. S. Feue r; 
Goncha rov "Oblomov", trans. Natalie Duddington; Ibsen "Pee r Gynt"; 
Zola "Germinal", trans. Havelock Ellis; Freud, " ew Introductory 
Lectures On Psychoanalysis". 

Dr. Gerhard Masur, Visiting' 
Professor of History; Ph.D. Ber-
line University, 1930; Teaching 
experience: Berlin University, 
University of Virginia, Berkeley, 
UCSD - I year (partial list); 
Humanities 6. 

Professor Masur comes from 
Germany and spent several years 
in Latin America before coming 
to the U.S. in 1946. His main 
interest is the history of ideas, 
or intellectual history. In par-
ticular he is concerned with 19th 
century European history. 

Dr. Masur plans to s tress 
several themes; Hegel, the de-
velopment of the bourgeois novel (especially Flaubert), Nietzsche, and 
the development of modern philosophy. 

His bookUst: Jacob Burckhardt "Force and Freedom"; Flaubert 
"Madame Bovary"; Hegel "Reason in History"; Thomas Mann "Budden-
brooks"j Gerald Masur "Prophets of YesterdaY"j Nietzsche "The Birth 
of Tragedy". 

Dr. Rudof Makkreel; Ph.D., 
Philosophy, Columbia University 
1966; teaching experience: UCSD, 
1967-8. 

Professor Makkreel's main in-
terests are 19th and 20th century 
philosophy - in particular Ger-
man philosophy and aesthetics. 

Makkreel, who taught the 
course last year, said that he 
will again stress the new con-
cept of history that evolved dur-
ing this period. With the French 
Revolution a new awareness gave 
history a philosophical impact. 
History was seen as something Ur. Rudolph Makkreel 
that progressed, rather than re-
mained stagnant. 

His book list; de Tocqueville "Democracy in America"; Flaubert 
"Madame Bovary"; Hegel "Reason in History"; Marx & Engels "Basic 
Writings on Politics & Philosophy", ed. Lewis Feuer; Dostoeyevski 
"Notes From the Underground" ; Nietzsche "Birth of Tragedy, Geneology 
of Morals" . 

Dr. Marlay is an Assistant 
Professor of Spanish Literature 
and is teaching Humanities 6. 

Dr. Marlay believes one pur-
pose of Humanities is to "expose 
the students to the methods of 
several humanistic disciplines--
literature, history, and philoso-
phy." He will orient his course 
historically and hopes the novels 
will be viewed as documents 
which reveal the qualities of the 
age and the countries in which 
they were written as well as 
literary masterpieces. 

Dr. Marlay wants his course 
to "develop the historical imagi-
nation of the stUdents." He believes "Humanites eventuaUy teache s 
understanding of human relations." "The TA's will give, by being 
in dUferent fields, a dillerent perspective." 

His bookUst: de TocqueviUe "Democracy in America"; Marx 
"Selected Writings"; Hegel "Reason in Hlstory"j Mill "The Six 
Great Humanistic Essays of John Stuart Mill"; Dickens "Hard Times"; 
Dostoeyevsky "The DevUS"j Twain "Huckleberry Finn"; with intro. 
& notes by Leo Marx.

Penner said that the experi-

if someone had been in 'the lab.

al levels. First is the question 
of whether or not the suites can 
accept the responsibility of the 
policy, second, it the individual 
student will be sufficiently pro-
tected and third, the reaction 
of the comm un;~v - La Jolla 
and Sail Diego. These are the 
main considerations facing the 
proposal. The proposal is ap-
parently quite sound in theory 
and regulations; the problems, i! 
any, seem to arise more lrom 
questioning the maturity of the 
students and their ab1l1ty to live 
up to the responsibilities given 
them by the policy than anything 
else . Both students and admini-
strators have expressed concern 
about this point. The final de-
cision has yet to be reached, it 
Is hard to predict the outcome 
and final fate of the visitation 
proposal.

COSA Sugg~sts Changes 
(Cont'd from P.I) 
probably consist of the College 
Dean, Resident Dean, and Resi-
dent Fellow, Hull said. The facul-
ty members would be selected by 
the Revelle faculty. 

The working organization of 
the Revelle government would 
consist in various "executive" , 
operational, and ad hoc sub-
committees. They would obtain 
their charters from and be re-
sponsible to the Council for as 
long as the Council saw fit. 

" Intere sted students," Hull 
explained, "could start a com-
mittee to study a proble m by ap-
pealing to the Council for recog-
nition, if no committee already 
existed for dealing with the prob-
lem." 

COSA sees four basic Execu-
tive Committees as necessary at 
the present time: Budget, Elec-
tions and Governmental Revision, 
Policy and Regulations, and 
Operational Committee Authori-
zation and Membership. Council 
members would chair these com-
mittees, which would form the 
basic framework of the system. 

Operational sub-committees 
would be formed periodically by 
the Council to assist the Execu-
tive Committees in more specific 
matters. Topics such as the hon-
or code, conduct and diSCipline, 
student-faculty relations, educa-
tional pollcy, and commuter stu-
dents would be dealt wlth in 
these sub-committees. 

Hull listed financing and gra-
duate student representation as 
the two most pressing problems 
before COSA at this time. 

"We must work with the AS," 
said Hull, "to determine how 
colleges ought to be funded. Per-
haps a set percentage of AS fees 

should revert to the college gov-
ernments, while the remainder 
should go for campus-wide ac-
ti vities." 

At the present there is no 
provision in the constitution or 
in practice which has guided the 
Senate in funding the colleges. 
Graduate student representation 
presents a problem, because 
grads are not required to pay the 
ASUCSD fee of $6 each quarter. 
Unless they were allowed to and 
agreed to pay the fee, they would 
not be able to vote on appropri-
ating the funds along with the 
undergraduates. "Either they 
would serve in an ex officio 
capacity," Hull said, "or they 
would not be allowed to vote on 
money matters." 

Hull suggested that the COSA 
plan could be applied to all the 
colleges at UCSD, and form, in-
stead, the basis of the ASUCSD 
in the future. "Perhaps repre-
sentatives from the various 
Councils would make up the AS 
Senate," he said. 

COSA will hold open hearings 
on the proposals it has made 
before a final constitution is 
written and put to a Revelle 
student vote. 

"Hopefully," Hull sald, "the 
work of COSA will be completed 
in time for the general AS Spring 
Elections," but another election 
would have to be he Id to fill the 
various offices provided for in 
the constitution. 

Interested students or repre-
sentatives from student groups 
may sign up tor the hearings in 
Provost Saltman's office or with 
John Nuber, Resident Fellow, in 
Beagle Hall. Written proposals 
are also encouraged, COSA said.

versity Extension also would be 
severly affected. He pointed out 
that since 1966-67, state person-
al income had risen 14.5 per-
cent and General Fund revenue 
33.7 percent, but that General 
Fund support per student as pro-
posed by the Governor's bud-
get rose only .6 percent. 

Governor Reagan answered 
that UC and the State Colleges 
had been given "top priority" 
and that larger budget Increases 
had gone to public higher edu-
cation than to othe r State agen-
cies. If increases had been a v-
eraged out among all agencies, 
the UC budget would have to be 
reduced another $11 .5 million, 
he said. 

The Gove rnor said he had 
asked last year for the largest 
single state tax increase in the 
history of the United States, and 
st ressed that the University 
should seek other savings in or -
der to admit all qualified stu-
dents. He suggested that UC study 
reccommendations for econo-
mies proposed by a special tax 
force earlier this year. 

Hitch reported the UC had laun-
ched a cost savings program, 
had employed a leading expert 
in this field in the person of 
Graeme Bannerman as vicepres-
ident for business and finance, 

. and had attempted "to cooperate 
in every way possible" wlth the 
task force. He said he had not 
yet been able to obtain a copy 
of the task force's detailed stu-
dy of the University. 

Dr. John S. Galbraith, Chan-
cellor of the San Diego campus, 
speaking for the nine Chancel-
lors, told the Regents he had come 
to California 20 years ago "be-
cause UC had a reputation of being 
the greatest state university in 
the country." This was now be ing 
challenged by New York and other 
states, and there is evidence that 
the UC system is "beingended," 
he said. 

"It takes a long time to build 
a great university but it does not 
take long to reduce it to medioc-
rity," he said. The final question 
said Dr. Galbraith was "whether 
the people of California can al-
ford the eminence of UC." 

Dr. Robley C. Williams, chair-

IIEIIIE 
.,IIIIAN 

man oC the Acade mic Councll, 
said he spoke for 5,000 UC pro-
fessors when he warned that "the 
position of the Unive risty is ra-
pidly becoming defenseless in re -
taining Its best men, and it ls 
becoming Impotent in recruiting 
the best teacher-scholars from 
the outside. The new budget for 
the University, if left unchanged 
by the Legislature, is a disas-
ter." 

Regent William C. Hudson, 
president of the CalUornia Alum-
ni Association, said he wa-; "con-
fident" that the alumni from the 
nine campuses supported the Re-
gent' s budget proposal and added 
"we will do all we can to tell 
the citizens about this situation." 

her Regents expressing simi-
lar views included John E. Can-
aday, Edward W. Carter and Ed-
win W. Pauley. 

Regent William M. Roth re-
called that "last year we were 
told the State was in a financial 
crisis. The Regents used $20 
m III ion oC the ir own funds in 
place of State money and accep-
ted a substantial cut in budget. 

ow we are faced with an 
even more meager budget, and 
the erosion of quality that began 
last year will continue ... The 
Regents therefore should reduce 
enrol\ment to Cit the amount of 
m01ey available ••. Then the State 
must face the fact that it can-
not educate as many students, 
including doctors, and lawyers, 
as the State requires ."

REPRESENTATIVES OF VISTA 
(Volunteers In Service To 
America), will be at UCSD, April 
1st and 2nd, to seek qualified 
candidates who are interested in 
helping people to transform the 
ugliness of poverty into some-
thing better. 

Headquarters for the two-day 
drive will be at the Revelle 
Campus Commons from 9:00 am 
to 3:00 pm. 

VISTA recruits, selects. and 
trains volunteers and then as-
signs them to projects which 
have ask~d for help throughout 
the country. 

VISTA Volunteers spendayear 
of their lives in Service To 
America. They see the world as 
it is, not as it should be. They 
work on Indian Reservations, in 
Migrant Labor Communities, at 
Job Corps Centers, in the hol-
lows of Appalachia and in pro- ' 
grams for the mentally ill and 
mentally retarded .. .from Alaska 
to the Virgin Islands , from Har-
lem to Hawaii. 

VISTA Volunteers come from 
the large cities and the small 
towns; from the business world 
and from the campus. Some have 
advanced degrees and some are 
without high school diplomas. 
The youngest is 18; the oldest 
is 85. 

To join VISTA, one must be at 
least 18 years old. There is no 
upper age limit. VISTA Volun-
teers may have no dependents 
under 18 years of age. VISTA 
is especially interested in re-
tirees •.• people who have retired 
from a job but not from life. 

There are no entrance re-
quirements or tests to join VIS-
TA. VISTA Volunteers receive 
allowances from housing, food, 
$75.00 for personal expenses and 
a stipend of $50.00 for each 
month of service. VISTA Volun-
teers ar~ covered hy a com-
plete, paid insurance plan for 
medical and hospital care. 

Representatives from VISTA 
will be available to answer ques-
tions and accept applications at 
the VISTA Information Center 
from 9:00 AM each day. The 
Academy Award-winning VISTA 
documentary, "A Year Towards 
Tomorrow", will be shown con-
tinuous ly in the Formal Lounge 
during the drive.
