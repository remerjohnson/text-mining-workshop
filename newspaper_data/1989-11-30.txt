Sexual Assault Suspect 
Caught By S.D. Police 
• Parolee Had 'Phone Fetish' 
By RANDY DOTINGA 
Senior Staff Writer 

The 23-year-old East San Di-
ego man arrested in connection 
with the recent rape of a UCSD 
student and a similar assault of a 
San Diego State University stu-
dent has a history of criminal ac-
tivity and was in violation of pa-
role at the time of the incidents, 
according to a California Depart-
ment of Corrections official. 

San Diego resident David Miller 
was arrested on Nov. 16 by San 
Diego Police. Miller, a fast food 
worker, has been charged with two 
counts of kidnapping, two counts 
of for<?ed oral copulation, and two 
counts of rape with a foreign ob-
ject. Miller is currently in County 
Jail, awaiting a preliminary hear-
ing on Dec. 8 to determine whether 
he will go to trial. 

with her, according to San Diego 
Police Detective Ken Creese. 

The caller also "threatened her 
and her family," Creese said. 
According to UCSD Police Detec-
tive Sgt. Bob Jones, the threats 
were not of a sexual nature. 

The victim drove to Front Street 
in downtown San Diego to meet 
the caller where, according to 
Creese, she was coerced into driv-
ing to a location where she was 
sexually assaulted. 

A similar assault occured Nov. 
15, when a San Diego State Uni-
versity (SDSU) student received a 
call from a man who said he had 
criminal information about her 
roommate he wanted to discuss 
with her. According to Creese, the 
caller also threatened the victim, 
who drove to meet the man on

A fire which started Tuesday afternoon near Black Mountain Rd. consumed over 4,500 acres of 
brush as of last night. Fanned by Santa Ana winds, the fire forced thousands to evacuate from 
both Rancho Penasquitos and Del Mar. The cause of the fire is unknown. At press time, the 
San Diego Fire Department reported that the fire was 90 percent contained. 

Miller's bail is set at $70,000, 
but even if he provides bail he 
cannot be released because he has 
violated parole, according to an 
information clerk at the County 
Jail. 

A.S. Questions Racial Sensitivity of 'Elvis Week' 

Cecil Parish, unit supervisor of 
the California Department of Cor-
rections Parole Division in EI 
Cajon, said Miller has been jailed 
several times since 1986. 

Miller was imprisoned in Feb-
ruary 1986 after he was convicted 
of receiving stolen property and 
was paroled the following Sep-
tember, according to Parish. 

Since his parole, Miller was 
jailed twice for violating parole 
and was placed under "high-con-
trol supervision," Parish said. 
Miller was jailed once for alleg-
edly making threatening phone 
calls in violation of parole, Parish 
said. He noted that a prison coun-
selor said Miller had a "phone fet-
ish." 

In 1988, Miller was jailed again 
for allegedly raping a 17-year-old 
female at knifepoint. The girl did 
not file charges, but the alleged 
rape was still a parole violation, 
Parish said. 

Miller waS last released on 
parole on Sept. 19 of this year. But 
after his release he failed to report 
to his parole officer, Parish said. 
According to Parish, a warrant was 
then issued for Miller's arrest, and 
his parole was suspended in Octo-
ber. 

The first sexual assault Miller is 
charged with occured Oct. IS, when 
a UCSD student was telephoned 
by a male who said he had infor-
mation about criminal activities of 
her roommate and wished to meet

~ Chinese students studying at 
UCSD publicly asked President 
George Bush this week to sign the 
Emergency Chinese Immigration 
Relief Act, which would allow the 
40,000 Chinese students attending 
U.S. universities to remain indefi-
nitely. 

According to information pro-
vided by Chinelte students at 
UCSD, current law requires that 
the Chinese students return to 
Chma within two years after com-
pleting their studies. 

The Emergency Chinese Immi-
gration Relief Act (H.R. 2712), 
passed unanimously by both houses 
of Congress, is "designed to pro-
tect Chinese students who have 
enthusiastically participated in the 
pro-democracy movement and thus 
fear retribution at home," states a 
press release distributed by Chi-
nese students. 

According to Patrick Caruso, a 
representative from the Washing-
ton D.C. office of Congressmem-

impersonators, movies starring 
Presley, and a possible concert by 
Elvis Costello at the end of the 
week. 

The debate concerning "Elvis 
Week" began after the A.S. mem-

ber Bruce Morris (D-Connecticut), 
a supporter of the bill, Bush can 
take several courses of action 
concerning the legislation. 

Bush can sign the bill, veto it, or 
elect to take no action. Bush "has 
until Dec. 2 to sign the bill, other-
wise it is killed," Caruso said. 

According to Bing-Xiao, a 
member of the Chinese Student 
and Scholar Association, Chinese 
students are concerned that Bush 
will not sign the bill because the 
Chinese government has threat-
ened to end 1111 student exchanges 
with the U.S. if the bill passes. 

Xiao said the Chinese govern-
ment asked Bush to veto the bill in 
yesterday's issue of the China 
Daily newspaper. Xiao added that 
it is highly unusual for the Chinese 
government to make a public state-
ment of this type and magnitude. 

Hong-Ming Zhang, another 
Chinese student at UCSD, said if 
Bush does not ~gn the bill, he will 
lose world-wide respect because 
"the world will think that [he1 
yielded to the pressure of the Chi-
nese government," Zhang said. 

Xiao expressed his belief that 
"if this bill is not passed, it will 
make it very hard for democratic 
views to be heard in China." 

UCSD Chinese students have 
been circulating petitions at the 
Price Center and among UCSD 
faculty as part of their efforts to 
lobby for the bill, according to 
Xiao. 

Xiao said if Bush does not sign 
the bill, the Chinese students would 
support new legislation introduced 
in the next congressional session. 

"No one knows what Bush will 
do ... [But ifhe does not sign it) we 
will work on rewriting the bill" for 
the next session in January, Xiao 
said. 

Caruso also believes that future 
legislation could be introduced next 
session jf Bush does not sign this 
bill. 

"It is possible that legislation 
similar or identical to [to H.B. 27121 
will be introduced next session," 
Caruso said. 

News Editor Anton Bittner 
contributed to this story. 

Commissioner of Academic 
Affairs Darin Malloy commented, 
"Who is this going to be fun for? A 
lot of people are going to be upset 
by this event ... comments have 
been made that Elvis was a racist, 
and we would be glorifying him," 
he said. 

Malloy asked, "Why couldn't 
we have a 'Roots of Rock and Roll 
Week'? " 

Later in the meeting, the ap-
pointment of David Kritzer as 
coordinator of the Sun-God festi-
val was also heavily debated, pri-
marily because his racial sensitiv-
ity was questioned. 

Vanness Harris began the de-
bate by reading from a Guardian 
letter to the editor from Kritzer 
printed in the May 11, 1989 issue. 
The letter complained about the 
Third Dean's Office's alleged ten-
dency to hire minorities. 

"I don't have problems with his 
qualifications, I'm just going by 
what he wrote. It is possible that he 
won't chose entertainment that can 
be enjoyed by people of color," 
Harris said. 

Kritzer defended himself, say-
ing, "The letter has been clarified 
and buried as far as I am con-
cerned; I have spoken to the for-
mer dean [of Third College1. I 
don't think it will affect my abili-
ties in programming .. . I, myself, 
have felt alienated by the music" in 
the past. 

Kritzer was appointed despite 
objections characterized by a vote 
of IS in favor and two opposed, 
with four abstentions.

Two UCB Students Attacked 
By Gang of Juvenile Boys 

A rash of unrelated youth pack attacks during the 
weekend injured two UC Berkeley students, Berkeley 
Police said 

According to police, a gang of about five juvenile 
boys attacked two UCB students after one of the students 
accidentally bumped into one of the juveniles. 

Cornell Holmes, 23, and Brad Hachten, 2~, were 
attacked after Hachten accidentally bumped into one of 
the juvenile boys they passed on the sidewalk. Hachten 
told police he was too inebriated to give an accurate de-
scription of his assailants, Berkeley Police Capt. Bobby 
Miller said 

'The UC Berkeley undergraduates said they were hit 
repeatedly from a11 directions. 

"Holmes said he wrestled one of the juveniles to the 
ground and lost his glasses during the melee," Miller 
said. 1be students received minor bruises.

UCR Considers Solutions To 
Avoid Future UC Expansion 

As California's population continues to grow, most 
UC administrators agree that expansion of the nine-
campus system is inevitable. But how to accommodate 
the expected influx of thousands of students remains 
undetermined. 

Whether to simply expand the existing nine cam-
puses, or to spend approximately $900 million to build 
three new campuses will be determined upon submis-
sion of each individual university'S Long Range Devel-
opment Plans, according to the UC Office of the Presi-
dent. 

Stuart Marshall, from the state legislative analyst's 
office, contended that the existing nine campuses can 
handle the enrollment jump without the construction of 
any new ones. 

"[ don't feel as though their arguments are compel-

News ( l1ips 
ling at this point," Marshall said of proponents of addi-
tional UC campus construction, citing an estimation that 
UC Riverside could reasonable accommodate 25,000 
students rather the planned 15,000. The existing cam-
puses are currently hoping to adequately provide for 
roughly 42,000 of the 63,000 students expected to enroll, 
Marshall said, adding that the 1987 UC Graduate Enroll-
ment Plan called for an unrealistic increaseof5,500 more 
students - 22 percent more than had previously been 
estimated in the plan. 

Providing that UCR took the additional 10,000 stu-
dents, the UC system as a whole would then only be faced 
with supporting 6,000 more prospective students over 
the next 15 years, Marshall said, adding that these stu-
dents could be partitioned among the other campuses by 
means of "slight over-enrollment." 

Although Marshall contends this future over-enroll-
ment figure is "not a significant number," UC officials 
disagree. 

"It's unwiseforacampus to grow faster than planned," 
UC Vice President for Budget and Planning William 
Baker said, citing the legislative analyst's office's view 
that UCR could legitimately grow more than threefold by 
2005. "The main concern is academic soundness," he 
added.

Controversial UCSB Radio 
Host Reinstated To Station 

Former KCSB talk show host Sean Hannity was 
reinstated to UCSB's campus radio station recently, but 
an apologetic Radio Council gave no guarantee that 
station management would put him back on the air. 

Hannity, absent from the hearing where the decision 
was announced, said Saturday night that he is "a little 
hesi tant to claim full victory." 

Hannity was dismissed in June by former KCSB 
student manger Cory Krell for allegedly making "dis-
criminatory statements" on a controversial Apr. 4 airing 
of his show, "In Pursuit of Happiness," in which Hannity 
and a guest criticized gays' behavior during the AIDS 
epidemic. 

The Radio Council, the branch of Associated Stu-
dents that oversees KCSB, voted 5-0 to extend Hannity' s 
1988-89 contract until June 3D, 1990, but said they do not 

by Bill Watterson 

have the authority to place Hannity back on the air. 
Hannity will have to reapply "just like everyone else" to 
get his program on the air winter quarter, said KCSB 
Associate Manager Dave Chin, a non-voting member of 
the Radio Council. 

The Radio Council also fonnally expressed "regrets" 
that Hannily was dismissed from the station, but they de-
clined to address several demands Hannity had made in 
his appeal letter, including his requests for apologies 
from station management and retroactive airtime to 
make up for time lost in the five-month appeal process. 

. The council received several letters from the public 
and station employees on the case in the past two weeks, 
including one from the American Civil Liberties Union 
defending Hannity on the grounds that his statements are 
guarded by the First Amendment. However, the ACLU 
explicitly stated it does not condone Hannity's views.

Atkinson Announces Exchange 
With Southern Universities 

Chancellor Richard Atkinson announced the estab-
lishment of a formal student exchange program between 
UCSD and two historically black universities in the 
United States: Morehouse College and Spelman College 
in Atlanta, Georgia. This new student exchange program 
is open to all UCSD undergraduates. 

According to Atkinson, the purpose of the program is 
to provide opportunity for students to Live and study at 
" important institutions of higher learning that are signifi-
cantly different from the social and educational environ-
ment typical of the California state institutions." He said 
the exchange students coming to UCSD from More-
house College and Spelman College will likewise bene-
fit from UCSD's different learning climate. 

The UCSD exchange is the only such program be-
tween the two colleges and any state institution west of 
the Mississippi. To be eligible, a student must have 
completed 90 quarter-units with a minimum GPA of2.7. 

Students interested in more information about this 
program can attend a one-hour orientation session at 9 
a.m. on Friday, Dec. I, in the Third College Provost's 
Conference Room 127, located in the Third College 
Administration building. Applications will be available 
at that time.

Students Boycott Domino's 
Over Owner's Abortion Views 

Pro-choice groups at 60 universities have begun 
campaigns to boycott Domino's Pizza over the past 
several weeks to protest the anti-abortion activities of the 
company's owners. 

Students Organizing Students (SOS), a national pro-
choice group, initiated the boycott in response to contri-
butions Domino's owner Thomas Monaghan recently 
made to anti-abortion organizations. 

According to Domino's public relations representa-
tive Moira McDermott, Monaghan donated $50,000 in 
personal funds to the Michigan Committee To End Tax-
Funded Abortions. 

"Mr. Monaghan used personal funds, not corporate, 
in his donations," McDermott said. "He has no ties to any 
anti-choice groups like Operation Rescue." 

SOS Coordinator Veena Sud disagreed, saying that, 
as the sole owner of Domino's, Monaghan's "personal 
funds come from the corporation. Students are one of his 
main customers. He's using some of our money to 
support anti-choice groups." 

At Penn State University, students passed out fliers 
which explained Monaghan's alleged use of corporate 
funds for anti-choice groups and the importance of the 
boycott. Along with the pamphlets, student boycott 
organizers held a rally outside of the local Domino's 
Pizza franchise in North Philadelphia.

Profs Outlin·e Communist Changes 
By CATHERINE DILLE 
News Editor 

Over 50 students crowded into 
the Berkeley room of the Price 
Center last week to hear two UCSD 
professors speak on social changes 
in the Soviet Union and East Ger-
many. 

Chairperson of the sociology 
department Timothy McDaniel 
addressed the topic of "The Social 
Context of Political Change in the 
Soviet Union." 

According to McDaniel, the old 
party rule of the Communist party 
in the Soviet Union is becoming 
"obsolete" as the party decides that 
the knowledge necessary to lead 
the nation does not reside exclu-
sively in the Communist party. 

"The kind of society [the Sov iet 
Union has] is inconsistent with the 
model of political rule . . . the 
nature of the political system of 
party rule has not corresponded 
with the requirements of the soci-
ety for a long time and the discrep-
ancy has become clearer." 

McDaniel said the Soviet lead-
ershipdid not have any choice as to 
instituting political change. 

"There were not any other op-
tions available, because in many 
senses the political regime was not 
adaptive to the realities of Soviet 
social life," he said. 

McDaniel said the social 
changes that the Soviet Union has 
been experiencing constitute a 
breakdown of the old model party 
state rule as it has existed in the 
Soviet Union since the 19205. 

"In the Soviet Union now, the 
leadership itself is using the word 
'revolutionary ' [to describe the 
recent changes]. 1bey are not hesi-
tant to call this another Russian 
revolution," he said. 

According to McDaniel, one of 
the major changes is that the Com-
munist party is more open to input 
from the populace. 

McDaniel added that "it is clear 
that the present leadership no longer 
believes in this idea of superior 
knowledge now, and they have 
reversed their priorities. They are 
now trying to leam from society." 

The emphasis is now on partici-
pation and debate, he said, as 
opposed to relying on expertise 
within the party. 

"The party is filled with those 
hacks who can't be engineers or 
specialists. Because of this, the 
party has suffered a tremendous 
loss of prestige," he said. 

McDaniel went on to say that 
this loss of legitimacy has caused 
the Communist party to be more 
attentive to popular opinion. He 
characterized this transition as 
being a change from the idea that 

Spirits of St. Germain 

knowledge is something that is 
"imposed from the top down" to 
the idea that the party must attend 
to the knowledge that is present in 
the populace. 

According to McDaniel, in the 
past, Communist leaders who lis-
tened to public opinion were ac-
cused of practicing "tailendism," a 
term Soviets use to describe a situ-
ation in which the tail leads the 
head. 

McDaniel pointed out that the 
changes that Soviet leader Mikhail 
Gorbechev is undertaking are "old 
ideas in Soviet Communism ... 
even under [former leader Leonid] 
Brezhnev these ideas were sug-
gested." 

McDaniel said that even if 
Gorbechev were defeated, the 
changes would still come to pass. 

Next to speak was Associate 
Professor of Sociology Richard 
Biernacki, who recently returned 
to UCSD from East Germany. 

Speaking of his visit abroad, 
Biernacki said "all of my precon-
ceptions were thrown out." 

Referring to the social changes 
in East Germany that led to the 
opening of the Berlin Wall, Bier-
nacki said they were brought about 
by a "revolution from below." 

He explained that strong social 
ties within German communities 
facilitate communication and

GIFTS. WINE. BEER. UQUOR. IMPORTED CHOCOLATES 
Just minuks/rom campus in HolUlay Court455-1414 

helped fuel the revolution from 
below. 

"Very dense networks of 
friends" allow East Germans to 
call town meetings "by word of 
mouth," he said. 

Biernacki also pointed out that 
many East Germans use the tenets 
of the communist doctrine to ques-
tion the political and economic 
situation in their country. 

He related one incident in which 
an East German worker stood up at 
a meeting and questioned the rela-

NEWS 3 

tionship between the workers and 
their products. 

"This worker stood up and said, 
' We are always told that workers 
create the wealth. If this is so, I 
want to know what happened to all 
the wealth I created: " Biernacki 
related. 

McDaniel said that last year 
"there were no history exams given 
[in the Soviet Union] because no 
one knew what the answers were. 
[1be Soviets] are coming to terms 
with their history."

Future Shocks 

Problems of the '90s 
It's a stunning time in our history. Communism is collapsing, 

our economy is in its longest period of expansion in history, the 
nation is optimistic ... 

But there are serious problems facing the world, and all of the 
good news tends to overshadow them. Political "leaders" are all 
too happy to avoid tough problems and emphasize how well 
things are going. The 1990s may hold great promise, but the 
longer these issues are ignored, the harder they'll be to deal with 
later. 

Ironically, one of the problems is how to get rid of these poli-
ticians. The incumbency rate in the Congress is disgraceful- the 
London Economist points out that the British House of Commons 
has nearly as high a turnover rate (five percent) as the Congress 
(seven percent), and the only way out of the House of Lords is 
death. The other problems which have undermined the public's 
confidence in Congress-ethical lapses, influence peddling, and 
unjustified pay raises - are all related to this central issue. The 
cost of campaigns is so high that incumbents, who have great 
advantages in collecting funds from special interest groups, are 
secure in their jobs. 

If there are no incentives fo!, a politician to be a real leader, and 
to actively pursue votes, he or she is unlikely to do so. Moreover, 
politicians reliance on special interests makes incidents such as 
the Lincoln scandal, which involved influence-peddling, inevi-
table. Serious campaign refonns are necessary, from changing 
the laws limiting campaign contributions to demanding higher 
ethical standards. But don't hold your breath; this will require the 
kind of self control that politicians are notorious for lacking. 

Another serious problem we will face in the 19908 was 
forshadowed by the San Francisco eanhquake. Images of col-
lapsed bridges are likely to become more common, even without 
earthquakes; the infrastructure is in a terrible state of disrepair. 
One of the lessons of the 1980s is that there are things the 
government doesn ' t do very well, things that should be left to the 
market 

But there are things that the government does do well; the most 
important of these is providing an infrastructure - bridges, 
roads, airports and, sea ports. The problem is that a variety oflaws 
make costs ridiculously high for government projects. For ex-
ample, the Davis-Bacon Act requires the government to pay the 
highest wages for a construction job - which, as The New 
Republic puts it, makes it impossible for the government to do 
anything involving shovels. The government, at federal state and 
local levels, must rededicate itself to providing for the nation's 
infrastructure. 

However, one of the last real attempts by the government to 
engage in public works construction was a failure . Urban renewal 
programs, and the building of public housing projects, resulted in 
homelessness and the deterioration of the inner cities. One of the 
central problems in the impoverished areas is drugs, but this is 
really a symptom, not the disease. The emphasis politicians place 
on the "War on Drugs" may be sincere, but it may also be a way 
of avoiding the more intractable problems of the inner city. 

The inner cities are in a tragic state, and their decline has not 
even been slowed in the past decades. New effort - and funds -
must be committed to education and programs in the inner city. 
Past legislation must be examined for provisions which discrimi-
nate against the poor, and which serve to block their progress. 

These are just three of the problems likely to haunt us in the 
1990s. The biggest problems of the next decade, of course, are 
going to be those we don't foresee. But if we faillo deal with the 
problems that face us now, and slip into complacency, the 1990s 
will not be the decade of promise it appears to be now. Instead, 
it may be a painful end to a painful century. 

Men's Soccer Team Victimized by Exams 
Editor: 

For the past two years, some 
members of the UCSD men's 
soccer team have been forced to 
drop classes for the simple reason 
that the team has reached the na-
tional finals. These members were 
compelled to drop their classes 
because exams occurred simulta-
neously with the national finals, 
and their professors were not will-
ing to give make-up exams. 

The players left for the nation-
als, the exams took place, and the 
players missed them. Upon re-
turning, those players realized they 
had little choice but to drop their 
panicular classes. This is ridicu-
lous. 

Although UCSD is known for 
its outstanding academic reputa-
tion, its spons program - espe-
cially over the last few years -
has proved to be very successful. 
This is evident because of five 
women's volleyball national 
championships and, most recently, 
all six fall spons teams qualifying 
for regional berths. 

Last year, at a breakfast for 
those UCSD teams and individu-
als who won national Champion-
ships, UCSD Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson praised theacbievements 
of the scholar-athletes and stated 
that UCSD needed to maintain 
this standard of athletic excellence. 

InAtkinson'sopinion,academ-
ics alone do not make for the well-
rounded student. What the chan-
cellor mayor may not know is that 
a large number of professors do 
not share in his enthusiasm for 
academic excellence. This is evi-
denced by the reluctance and even 
refusal to make exceptions for 
athletes who must travel during 
times of exams even after a letter 
from the athletic director explain-
ing the student's situation and 

CAVNA 

asking for a bit of leeway. The 
student has consistently been 
denied any request to make up 
missed work. 

Perhaps these professors feel 
that giving special privileges will 
detract from the school's academic 
reputation. Schools such as UCLA 
and UC Berkeley have thriving 
academic and athletic programs. 
We are sure that athletes at these 
and other schools with outstand= 
ing academic and athletic pro-
grams do not encounter the same 
problems our athletes have been 
subjected to. 

What many professors may not 
understand is that a successful 
athletic program only adds pres-

Commentary 

tige to a school's reputation. We 
ate not insinuating that athletics 
are more important than academ-
ics, but we feel that professors at 
UCSD are hampering the progres-
sion of scholar-athletes' perform-
ances both in and out of the class-
room. Their inflexibility on the 
rare ocassions that students miss 
class because of athletic obliga-
tions forces the student to make 
absurd choices between taking a 
midterm or playing for a national 
championship. 

With a few words from the 
chancellor and others in the ad-
ministration, this problem should 
be able to be worked out.

Secularizing Abortion 
By ANDREA ADLEMAN, S.lIior StaffWriUr 

A lener like the one by Michael F. Burkhalter in The Guardian (Nov. 
20) is very depressing news for supporters of abortion rights. At once I 
find myself angry, disgusted, saddened, and offended. 

On one level, his argument is very simple: he opposes abortion 
because he feels that the fetus is a living being. In addition, he urges 
fellow Catholics to listen to their church's teachings and to speak out 
against abortion. He is particularly critical of a letter in an earlier issue 
of The Guardian in which Rich Vechinski, a Catholic, stated his pro-
choice position. 

What Burkhalter says is nothing new, just the same points Catholics 
opposed to abortion usually make. It would be easy to write a response 
to those points alone, but what bothers me most is the way he makes his 
argumenL 

His tone is childish and immature, especially in his comments to Mr. 
Vechinski. His words connote that those holding a different opinion are 
not equal in status to anti-abortion activists such as Mr. Burkhalter. 

Mr. Burkhalter states that "government can and should take certain 
choices away from men and women." Fair enough. But government 
cannot and should not take choices away when the basis is religious, as 
it is in the abortion issue. 

A front-page anicle in The Los Angeles Times on Nov. 22 noted that 
"American voters ... opinion polls show, deeply resent the intrusion of 
sectarian religious beliefs into politics." You can bet I'm one of those 
voters. Church and slate must remain separate institutions.

Mr. Burkhalter's lener overflows with 
condescension and an air of superiority, as 
demonstrated in the following sentences: 
"Mr. Vechinski might be commended for

In all honesty, I'm not sure how to respond 
to this implied claim. (Maybe it's because 
I'm less intelligent.) 

"All biological evidence'''! Let me call 
your attention to just one statement to the 
contrary. The Nov. 13 issue of The Nation 
asks, "Is an Embryo a Person?" The author

B urkhalter feels that Mr. Vechinski' s points purportedly scientific argument comes as a 
are worthless. Who is to judge? It seems as 
though Mr. Burkhalter has become the self-
appointed judge in determining the validity 
of a position. Interesting. Disgusting. 

I'm sure I'm not the only pro-choice 
activist who was very happy to read Mr. 
Vechinski's letter. To us, his points are 
extremely valid. His support of choice and 
his affirmation that religion should stay in 
the church left me relieved and just slightly 
more optimistic. 

Mr. Burkhalter's condescension persists 
in his complaint that "it is already madden-
ing enough to see the intellectual dishon-
esty of pro-choice groups, who deny the 
humanity of the fetus, despite all biological 
evidence to the contrary, and yet remain 
steadfast in their morally bankrupt posi-
tions." 

"Intellectual dishonesty''? I have a re-
ally hard time with this one. It's difficult to 
avoid concluding that Mr. Burkhalter thinks 
that pro-choice activists are less iptelligent. 

surprise to most embryologists, however, 
for it contradicts all that they have learned 
in the past few decades. The benefit of that 
knowledge .. . has been notably missing 
from most public discussions of abortion 
and all the legal decisions that have created 
so much recent publicity." 

In his aniele, Gardner argues that the 
embryo has the potential to become a human 
being, but that personhood is not estab-
lished at conception. "Fertilization, the 
injection of sperm DNA into the egg, is just 
one of the many small steps toward full 
human potential." 

As for biological evidence, he states that 
"it seems arbitrary to invest this biological 
event with any special moral significance. 
As we have seen, we are more than the surn 
of our chromosomes; DNA is not destiny." 

Whatever value one sees in Gardner's 
article, it is clearly a denial of Mr. 
Burkhalter's claim to "all biological evi-
dence." Or is Gardner's argument invalid

too? I can't help but think that Mr. Burkhal-
ter is convinced that his position represents 
The Truth. 

It must be stated that men inherently 
have limited contact with the issue. Just as 
Anglos can never truly understand the 
experiences of black, latinos, and other 
non-Anglos, men can never understand an 
issue so intimately linked to women. By ad-
vocating choice, Mr. Vechinski implies that 
he is aware of this fact. 

Do you have a sister, Mr. Burkhalter? 
. How would you feel if she brought into 
your family the result of a violent sexual 
crime? Would you be able to love the child? 
Needless to say, Catholics aren't exempt 
from rape. 

The debate goes on and on. Frankly, I'm 
tired of arguing about it. But that doesn't 
mean I'll ever stop fighting. 

It all amounts to the larger issue of social 

BENSON 

change versus the status quo. The editorial 
in the same issue of The Nation made an 
insightful observation regarding our soci-
ety as we approach the tum of the century. 
Casting a pessimistic view of current eco-
nomic conditions, the commentary notes 
that "govemment is reduced to arguing 
about symbols (the flag), sex (photos of 
penises) and ~ligion (the humanity of a 
zygote)." 

Abortion in terms of " religion (the 
humanity of a zygote)" is one way of con-
ceptualizing the issue. In my view, the 
bonom line isceligionand the role of women 
in a society, a related topic. 

You're right, Mr. Burkhalter - to a 
Catholic , abortion is morally bankrupt. 
However, beliefs of Catholics cannot in-
fringe upon others' rights to make personal 
choices. Some of us deny your premises. 
Some of us don't believe in your God.

Continued from page 1 
Orange Avenue near 36th Street 
and was assaulted by him nearby. 

On Nov. 16, another female 
SDSU student received a phone 
call from a male saying he had 
criminal information about her 
roommate, according to Creese. 

"This person made some threats 
that were similar Cto those in the 
previous cases], and made an ap-
pointment for her to meet him on 
EI Cajon Boulevard," the San 
Diego detective said. 

The student did not go to meet 
the male caller, but instead noti-
fied police. Several undercover 
officers, including a female officer 
taking the place of the student, 
then boarded the bus the student 
was supposed to take to meet the 
caller, Creese said. 

"We got to the bus stop, and 
Miller was there, and was taken 
into custody by sex crime detec-
tives," Creese said. 

The detective speculated that 
Miller was specifically targeting 
college students, but said he did 
not know how Millt:r obtained the 
victims' phone numbers 

Jones said UCSD Police were 
actively involved in the investiga-
tion of the sexual assault of the 
UCSD student, along with the San 
Diego Police. 

According to Jones, UCSD 
Police requested that Pacific Bell 
place a "phone trap" on the UCSD 
victim's line. 

A "phone trap" instantaneously 
notifies the phone company ofthe 
origin of any phone calls to a spe-
cific Jibe, Jones said. 

The male caller telephoned the 
UCSD victim's residence about 10 
times after the assault, Jones said, 
and talked to her roommate. 'The 
phone company informed officers 
that the calls were coming from 
pay phones on EI Cajon Boulevard 
and University Avenue, Jones said

Volunteer Connection Helps Students Lend Helping Hand 
By JAMES COLLIER 
Features Editor 

Lending a hand to others, ac-
cording to Volunteer Connection 
Director Paula Brietweiser, is a 
good way to have fun. 

" We're a [student-run] service 
of the A.S., like the Grove, or 
Assoned Vinyl," she said. 

Brietweiser said the purpose of 
the organization is to find volun-
teer wolt for anyone interested al 
UCSD, including students. faculty, 
and staff. 

" We get students who want to 
volunteer, and we match them up 
with an organization," she said. 

"[Volunteerism has] gone na-
tional," Brietwei ser said. "[t' s kind 
of the fad ofthe '80sand '90s." 

Large numbers of organizations 
are trying to get students invol ved, 
she pointed out. 

"TIle pendulum has swung back 
from the 'me' generation," she said 
"Everybody wants to set things 
straight. Most of the private schools 
have volunteer centers, and the 
public colleges are just picking it 
up. Major industry is jumping in as 
well." 

All of UCSO's colleges have 
community service groups, she 
added. When the Volunteer Con-
nection first staned in 1986, it 
worked with approximately 50 to 
60 agencies. Currently, they wolt 
with 200 to 250 agencies. 

One of the organizations Vol-
unteer Connection works with is 
the United Way, Brietweiser said. 

"They're our main source of 
information," she said. "As they 
have expanded, so have we. " 

According to the director, San 
Diego volunteer agencies are 
" rediscovering" that university 
students want to help. Students 
were at one time looked at as unre-
liable, she said. 

"But I think organizations are 
seeing that we do have students 
who are reliable- that we have 
students who really want to help." 

The United Way, in fact, has 

~ ----- - - ---

organized StoJdents Actively Vol-
unteer for You (SA Vy), an or-
ganization which finds volunteer 
activities that students might be 
successful with. Breitweiser said 
that SA VY is the only organiza-
tion of its kind in San Diego. 

The Volunteer Connection does 
more than just match students with 
organizations, Brietweiser said. 

"We sponsor projects or help 
co-ordinate events with other 
groups," she said. 'The biggest 
one we did was when 200 students 
went to a charity race at Balboa 
Park. 

" We've sent students to work 
with San Diego Youth Involve-
ment, a group that works with 
youths a step away from juvenile 
hall. We've had students repaint 

one oftheir halfway-houses." 
Currently, one of the larger 

projects the Volunteer Connection 
is organizing is the Angel Tree 
Project. 

"It comes out of San Diego 
Social Services," Brietweiser said 
"There's a Christmas tree in Round 
Table [a pizza parlor located in the 
Price Center] that we hung with 
100 ornaments with children's 
names, ages, and three wishes." 

The children's wishes are three 
choices of gifts they would like for 
Christmas. A person takes the 
ornament with the wishes, and 
brings back one of the child' s 
choices to Round Table Pizza, 
Brietweiser said. 

"The gifts go 10 children who 
are wards of the coun, or who are 

in foster care because of severe 
emotional or physical abuse," she 
said "UCSD is supplying 130 
students with gifts. The bookstore 
is donating some stuff. The cam-
pus police donated a skateboard. A 
lot of student groups are getting 
involved. It's a real neat way to get 
involved during the Christmas 
season." 

Why should students volunteer? 
"There are a lot of reasons," 

Brietweiser said, "Such as killing 
extra time. A big one is that it looks 
good on your resume ... It's also 
really fun. You get that fuzzy-
wuzzy feeling all over." 

Brietweiser ~aid she volunteers 
time with the Special Olympics. 

"It has nothing to do with my 
major. It's just fun," she said. 

Volunteering, Brietweiser said, 
gives students a chance to get out 
of a university environment. Also, 
students interested in sociology or 
psychology can get experience in 
their fields and see whether or not 
they are interested in pursuing their 
chosen careers, she said. 

'There's a number of opponu-
nities for students," Brietweiser 
said. "Students interested in spe-
cial education can work with the 
Special Olympics, Association of 
Retarded Citizens, or the San Di-
ego Parks and Recreation Disabled 
Services. There's also the San 
Diego Center for emotionally and 
physically abused children. Stu-
dents can provide peer counseling, 
andjust be there for the children." 

A.S. President John Ramirez Says He is Concerned About Student Fees 
By BRIAN TORRES 
Contributing Writi~ 

Editor's Note:A .S. President 
John Ramirez, in an interview with 
The Guardian, said there there are 
two main issues being dealt with 
by the A .S; decreasing student COSIS 
aruJ increasing the effectiveness of 
the A .S . 

Ramirez said he was concerned 
by increases in state tuition fees, 
because the increases would cause 
more students to need financial 
aid, and thus deplete available 
iinancial aid funds. "There would 
be less of a financlal pot relative to 
he price of an education," he said. 

A 10 percent increase in UC 
student fees fOT the 1989-90 year 
was to have gone into effect fall 
quaner. However, due to lobbying 
in Sacramento by A.S. 
repes.mwives from the various 

UC campuses, the 10 percent 
increase was restrained to three 
percent, Ramirez said. 

In regard to state-wide 
registration fees, Ramirez said the 
A.S. was "able to make a stand, 
pass a resolution, write letters to 
the governor, and send myself up 
to Sacramento. " 

However, the decrease in the 
fee rise was for the 1989-90 school 
year only. 

"One of the big concems is that 
the legislature passes a resolution 
keeping a ceiling on state-wide 
fees ... but the governor vetoed it. 
In other words, the governor could 
raise student fees as much as 50 
percent if he wanted to ..• That's 
something AS. Vice President of 
Extemal Mishka Migacz is looking 
inlO, and she and I will go 10 the 
capicol ill mid-Dec:ember 10 find 

out what's going on," Ramirez said 
Another area of student costs 

that concems Ramirez are night 
and weekend parking fees, recentl y 
imposed on students by the 
administration. 

"We were pretty much opposed 
to night time and weekend parking 
costs," he said. 

Ramirez added that, despite 
difficulties, the A.S. succeeded in 
reducing the price of a night and 
weekend parking permit from $1.5 
per quaner to S4 per quaner for 
students. 

This was a reduction in the 
permit cost to a break-even point 
of what it actually costs to protect, 
maintain, and light the lots, 
Ramirez said. He added that the 
reduction only affected students. 

Increasina the effectiveness of

concems. Increased effectiveness 
requires that the A.S. choose 
projects that it can accomplish in 
one year, he said. 

Ramirez said he is also 
emphasizing that projects be 
accomplished through 
subcommittees. This is effective 
in that such groups can concentrate 
on a specific project without being 
distracted, he explained. 

"When an issue comes up, 
instead of talking about it and 
having five-to-six hour meetings 
and then just letting it go, I set up a 
subcommittee with a chairman 
responsible for giving us 
recommendations by a cenain 
time," Ramirez said. 

Ramirez feels the A.S. has so 
far shown marked success in 
dealina with a number of important 
iuuea effectively. He pointed to 

John Ramirez 
A.S. the way in which the A.S. has 
addressed the state-wide tuition 
hike issue as one example of A.S. 
effectiveness. 

"I think we were really effect! ve 
and made. big impact. UCSD wu 
well repruenled, " RamilU said.

College football bas bowl 
games. 

Sure, the bowl games are 
traditona1, but more often than 
DOl they just end up as a cure for 
somebody's holiday hangover. 
As far as actuaJly being played 
to decide the national champi-
onship, well, that's a rarity. 

Only twice in this decade 
has a bowl game matched the 
two to~ranked teams against 
each other, but even then, who 
is to say that these are tbe best 
two teams? 

According to the pons, these 
teams were numbers one and 
two, but what is a poll? As is so 
often proven in every other 
sport, the best records and the 
ID06t impressive Slats don't 
alwaysmeananything. Stats and 
polls can lie. 

By ERIC BROSIO 
Staff Writer 

Looking good on paper is fine, 
but teams that play well together 
can usually throw the paper in the 
trash. 

Nobody has contended that the 
UCSD men's basketball team will 
overwhelm opponents with raw 
talent, but the Tritons' 86-73 tam-
ing of the Claremont Stags on 
Tuesday night was an example of 
just how far a team can propel 
itself with its own chemistly. 

Claremont, which Marshall says 
is "one of the top two teams in the 
conference," looked like it meant 
business in the early-going. The 
Stags cut to the basket and utilized 
their center, Henry Albrecht, for 
some post-up scoring. 

With Claremont's offense be-
ginning to jell, the Tritons stumbled 
early and had trouble getting out of 
the starting blocks. Sloppy passes 
and poor shot selection by UCSD 
allowed the Stags to charge to a 
quick lead. 

For teams with bad chemistry, 
an inauspicious start often spells 
disaster. Team play, however, has 
been theTritons' hallmark thus far 
into the season. 

"UCSD isn't goingto blow any-
body away," Triton Head Coach 
Tom Marshall admitted. "I am 
confident, however, that this team 
is going to win because of how all 
the players feel about each other. 
Nobody is playing for anyone 
person. They are playing for the 
team." 

Despite faIling behind early, the 
Tritons managed to keep their 
composure and battle back. 

Tim Rapp and Rick Ban paced 
the Tritons offensivel y in the first 
half, with II and 8 points apiece. 
Their perfonnance kept the Tri-
tons within one basket of Clare-
mont at halftime, 35-33. 

Rapp, currently leading the 
Tritons in scoring with a25.3 aver-
age, scored 15 points on the night. 

UCSD came out strong in the 
second haIf, taking just over three 
minutes to literally steal the lead. 

Sophomore guard Darvin 
Jackson managed two quick steals 
which lead to Triton scores, giving 
them a40-38 edge. Jackson wound 
up with 18 points himself on the 
night, his season-high. 

Junior Tom Shawcroft com-
bined three-point plays with three-
point baskets to lead UCSD with 
21 points. 

Ban also continued to contrib-
ute with a couple of three-point 
plays of his own, and UCSD broke 
open a 6\ -50 lead midway through 
the second half and never looked 
back. 

The Stags were not able to 
mount any kind of scoring threat, 
and the Tritons maintained at least 
a seven-point margin for the re-
mainder of the contest. 

Team shooting percentages 
were fairly even, as UCSD man-
aged a respectable 49_percent from 
the floor, compared to Claremont's 
45 percent. 

"I thought we would have to 
play flawless basketball to beat 

lust tor argument's sate, as-
sume the AP college footbaU 
poll to be accurate and its rank-
Jop absolute. This year's bowl 
picture makes a mockcty of the 
idea of a college football na-

rado-two teams that were top

Notre Dame had 10 go and lose

bowl picture into a mess.

This year's women's basket-
ball team is young. 

Really young. 
Tuesday's 85-67 victory over 

Southern Cal College in Costa 
Mesa was an example of just how 
young this team with nine new-
comers really is. 

The Tritons were once again 
led by team scori ng leaders Kath-
leen Alvarez and Carl Young. two 
sophomores who each tallied 20 
points in helping the Tritons win 
up their record to \-3. 

The team's most experienced 
player, senior point guard Nancy 
Caparaz, was just short of a triple-
double with 12 points, 10 re-

bounds, and 8 assists. 
UCSD outre bounded the 

Vanguards51-22, utilizing some 
of those boards for second-chance 
points in shooting 46 percent 
from the floor. 

"We finally broke the ice," 
Alvarez said about the team's 
first victory since last year's 19-
6 season. 

"Now that we've done that, 
we'll see if we can kcep it up and 
continue to make progress," 
Alvarez continued. 

UCSD travels to face Clare-
mont College in a 7 p.m. game on

ment surrounding this game would have been far greater 
had Notre Dame beaten Miami last week, but it's been a 
while since three Division I college football teams went 
through an entire season without a loss (right now, only 
Colorado and Alabama remain undefeated). One argu-
ment says that the Irish's loss to Miami makes them ex-
ceptionally angry and ready to round up the Buffaloes. 
Maybe. But Tony Rice ain't Jerry Rice, and Colorado is 
a team on a mission: they 've never been this far and 
they 're not likely to let their nutty Boulder fans down. 
Besides, I lived in Boulder for six months in 1981 and the 
Buffaloes are not about to let me down, either. PHIL says

BOWLS 
Continued from page 10 
muddled if Colorado loses. 

And if Colorado wins, who is to 
say that UCLA, even with a losing 
record, can't beat Colorado? 

The point is, the bowl games do 
nothing to clear up who's number 
one. All they do is provide enter-
taining, postseason college foot-
ball, while making millions for the 
NCAA and thetelevision networks. 

Perhaps the NCAA should cre-
ate a playoff fonnat that mimics 
the final 64 field of basketball. The 
field should be smaller-say l60r 
32 teams - and they should be

voted in by a panel of sportswriters 
and head coaches. Granted, not all 
of the top teams may be repre-
sented, but the top 10 teams would 
cenainly be there. Then, the win-
ner would be an undisputed na-
tional champion, and the guess-
work involved in the ratings sys-
tem would be eliminated. 

Rather than remove them, the 
bowl games could become first-
round matchups with less empha-
sis placed on who gets what bid, 
but rather on what bowl gets the 
number one team and so on. The 
NCAA could include a stipulation 
that calls for a type of rotation 
system. That way, bowls such as

The UCSD Guardian 

the Orange Bowl wouldn't simply 
be able to outbid other bowls for 
the number one team. Thus, smaller 
bowls like the Peach and the Holi-
day Bowl would be given the op-
portunity to draw big crowds and 
make a name for themselves. 

With such a modification on the 
postseason format,the bowl games 
could continue to exist, and later-
round playoffs could either be 
played at predetennined locations 
or on a home-field advantage ba-
sis. Either way, the NCAA could 
continue the bowl games and - at 
the same time - end the foolish, 
perennial arguments as to who 
really is number one.

Fuzzy Duck: Boot Factor 2 
Fuzzy duck is a game of oral dexterity. and even fast-talking pre-

law rypes will have a tough time with this one. 
Participants assemble in a circle. and the first player begins this 

verbal tag game by looking at the person on his right and saying. 
"fuzzy duck." This second player now looks to his right and also says. 
''fuzzy duc\c.." This continues around the circle until someone de-
cides to reverse the direction of the game. To do this, a player must 
look at the person who just g!1ve him the "fuzzy duck" (on his left) 
and say, "duzzy." This not only sends the game in the opposite 
direction. but also changes the passing word from "fuzzy duck" to 
"ducky fuzz." 

The game continues in the new direction with each player 
looking to his left and saying "ducky fuzz" until another player says 
"duuy," reversing the direction again and changing the passing 
word back to "fuzzy duck." The turkey who gets tongue-tied or 
breaks the tempo must drink and start the new round.

Grove Displays Mexican 
Holiday Traditions 

By Andrea AdJeman 
Hiatus Senior Staff Writer· 

Las posadas. 
La Virgen de Guadalupe . 
Los po.stores . 
These are among the Mexican 

holiday traditions depicted in 
"V.J.M. y J .• " the Grove Gallery's 
current exhibit of seasonal Mexi-
can folk art. 

The exhibit offers a journey into 
the diverse states of Mexico. "a 
glimpse into a small facet of an-
other culture," according to Grove 
Gallery director Maryann Callery. 

The winter holiday season in 
Mexico begins on Dec. 12 with La 
Fiesta de La Santisma de la Virgen de 
Guadalupe, a commemoration of 
the virgin of Guadalupe. parroness 
of the Republic of Mexico. The 
virgin of Guadalupe is said to have 
miraculously appeared on this day 
in 1531. 

Figuresoftheparroness, usually 
commonplace throughout the year 
in Mexican schools. homes. public 
transportation. cars. and shops, 
abound on Dec. 12. 

One of the most prominent 
pieces in the exhibit is the altar 

Figures currently on display at the Grove 

dedicated to the virgin of Guada-
lupe, constructed in the Grove 
Gallery by Arizona artist Edna San 
Miguel. San Miguel works in a 
Tuscon gallery with Alexandra 
Kollar, who collected the exhibit's 
omamentsand figures throughout 
Mexico. 

The altar is a collage of reli-
gious items and ordinary trinkets 
ranging from a cross over which 
rosary beads are draped to baby 
booties and black and white pho-
tographs. The virgin sits atop the 
altar, a backdrop of colored paper 
radiating from her body. A sense of 
nostalgia dominates the altar. 

In the artist's statement, San 
Miguel noted the personal nature 
of the altar: "The shrine contains 
momentos from events in a family 
- A small flower from a joyous 
wedding; a toy of remembrance 
from a baby shower; and momen-
tos of remembrance to deceased 
loved ones. Photos usually repre-
sent the sick or the dead." 

Recalling a childhood experi-
ence of listening to her grand-
mother recite the rosary, San 
Miguel wrote that the altar em-
bodies "the love, the warmth and 
deepfaiththatlcould have gained 
only through my grandmother's 
shrine." 

The next holiday of the season 
is lAS Posadas , celebrated from Dec. 
16 to Dec. 24. Posada, meaning 
shelter, signifies Mary's and 
Joseph's search for hospitalityprior

Jean-Paul Gaultier 
Aow TOM DoK Z4t 
Polygram Records 

''What good do you think you 
could get out of working with 
someone/Uh I think that I should 
/ Ahh." 

This is the conversation that 
begins five of Jean Paul Gaultier's 
songs on his albumAow Tou Dou 
Zat. Unforrunately, rhe album does 
not contain much more substance 
than this. 

In this trendy dance club col-
lect ion of songs , Gaultier has based 
13 ofthealbum's 14 songs around 
a single idea. And what is that 
idea! The simple phrase "How to 
do that." 

Now for the really surprising 
part of this whole affair. Gaultier is 
a fa mous French fashion designer. 
Yes, folks, Andy Warhol was right 

when he said that everyone in 
their lifetime would get their fif-
teen minutes of fame. 

On top of that, Gaultier helps 
to solidify the notion that a pelWn 
can be a great artist in one medium 
but not in another. 

This is proven not only by the 
fact that all of the songs are very 
similar to The Art of Noise, but 
also because after three songs with 
the same lyrics repeated over and 
over one is ready to throw this 
album as far as humanly possible. 

The only songs that are worthy 
of attention on the album are "It's 
Crazy with an Accordeon" and 
"How to Mix That." "Accordeon" 
is worth listening to simply be-
cause there are absolutely no lyrics 
to distract from the dance beat. 

"Mix That" brings the album to 
a refreshing close. "Technic Idea" 
is also worthy of some recognition 
because it incorporates an easy 
dance beat with a little funk mixed 
in. 

For all those people that buy 
albums for a social statement, this 
album is not for you. However, if 
you like to dance to rem ixed songs, 
then Aow Tou DOli Zac is just what 
you need.

Serofl(e An,rels 
Warner Bros. Records 

Laurie Anderson is bade.. Her 
stage show, Empty Places, opened 
last month in New York. Her new 
album entitled SCTonge Angels has 
just been released and an upcom-
ing tour to accompany the album 
will begin soon. With this album, 
Anderson shows a new side of her 
talents: singing. 

For those unfamiliar with lau-
rie Anderson, her work until now 
has consisted almost exclusively of 
spoken anecdotes often modified 
by running her voice through vari-
ous electronic special effects. But 
now her surprisingly rich voice 
lends a newer, more mainstream 
sound to this album. 

Adding to this new sound is a 
rather interesting backup singer: 
Bobby McFerrin. Anderson and 
McFerrin, both potentially out of 
their element with rraditionalsing-
ing, prove they are capable singers 
on "The Dream Before." 

Along with singing, Anderson 
has adopted a more popular style 
with her lyrics, using choruses and 
fade-outs. These detract from the 
songs which display her strong suit 
as a storyteller. While none of the 
songs can be individually counted 
as detrimental to the album as a 
whole, a void still exists. 

Anderson's narrative doesstana 
strong on songs such as "Beautiful 
Red Dress" and "Babydoll," but 
other songs fall somewhat short. 
Nonetheless, falling short for an 
artist like Laurie Anderson is still 
falling way ahead of the rest.

pel in are sprinkled throughout the 
bands recent self-entitled Capitol 
release. Like these groups, Prin-
cess Pang's album is made to play 
at the highest volume. It is the 
only way to experience the rich 
talent. 

The Swedish band's strength is 
not found in their lyrics but in the 
spontaneity of their music. The 
guitar solos are not mechanical, 
boring attempts to show off child-
hood guitar lessons; they are true 
displays of what a skilled guitarist 
can do. 

Many songs shine on the al-
bum, and it is hard todecide which 
is the best. "South St. Kids" is the 
most unique, and its combination 
of Andy Tjemon's and Jay Lewis' 
rhythm and lead guitar emphasize 
the celebration of life, rebels, and 
rock. Jeni Foster's Geddy Lee style 
vocals give the song a hard, gritty 
edge. 

Like other metal albums, many 
of the songs sound similar to other 
artists, yet it doesn't matter, be-
cause the sound is so addicting. 
"I'm Not Playin' " is a clear imita-
tion of Guns N Roses' "Rocket 
Queen," and "Too Much Too 
Soon" captures early Aerosmith. 

But these songs are not blatant 
rip-offs, like Kingdom Come. They 
display the influences of these 
bands and the deep admiration 
Princess Pang has for its mentors. 

The lyrics are nor brilliant, but 
See PANG, page 5

they are written with street rough-
ness and honesty. "No Reason to 
Cry" is a prime example: "Ran 
around town in the pouring rain/ 
Got to work all soakin' wetll pick 
up my pay at the end of the dayl 
And the money's already been 
spent." 

"China Doll," "Anyway You 
Want It," and the rest of the sonp 
all contain the magic spark which 
could propel this band into the 
spotlight. The use of blues, funk, 
and a wide variety of guitar styles 
show the band's respect for all forrns 
of music. 

Princess Pang is for people who 
want to let loose and have a good 
time with a band that has the same 
philosophy. The album is consis-
tent from start to finish, and if they 
gain enough airplay, Princess Partg 
could surpass Poison.

Billy Joel

Upon first hearing the album, 
the only thing that went through 
my head was "Oh Billy, has it come 
to this!" 

But, I think Scann Front grows 
on you. The album as a whole is 

Jambay 
Continued from page 3 
think they've been together for 
years. There seems to.be a kind of 
chemistry between the four musi-
cians, and there must be, consider-
ing the fact that about half of their 
show is improvisational. They just 
take a song and run with it. 

Jambay's music is difficult to 
describe with words. Doty explains, 
"We don't really fit into a cate-
gory. Every time we play a gig, 
somebody tries to write, 'They are 
jazz, rock, folk, soul, reggae ... .' 
They are just stringing words to-
gether." 

AIL the band members agree 
that their style could best be de-
scribed as "electric improvisa-
tional." Whatever you want to 
label them. the bottom line is that 
they can unargueably be titled "tal-
ented." 

All of the songs are original and 
the entire band contributes to the 
songwriting. Their sound is up-
beat and harmonious, and perhaps 
the most outstanding feature is 
Doty's rich vocals. The overall 
effect is so strong and melodic that 
it inspires dancing, even from those 
who don't normally dance in pub-
lic. 

What we have to look forward 
to from these musicians is a tape, 
which will be available at Assorted 
Vinyl sometime in early JanuarY, 
and numerous future shows. 

interesting in its incorporation of 
many different styles, showing 
Joel's artistic and intellectual 
growth as a songwriter. 

This obvious maturation leads 
to the final shedding ;)f the rough 
yet pithy innocence that has been 
his mark of artistry over the last 20 
years. 

In 1970, Billy Joel's first solo 
album, Cold Spring Harbor, opened 
with a sweet lyrical song entitled 
"She's Got aWay." 

Nearly 20 years later, Storm 
Front opens with "That's Not Her 
Style," a lOng that must have been 
written in cooperation with 
Christie Brinkley's PR team. The 
music is boring, the lyrics tiring, 
and the message! 

Well, it is a defense of his wife 
against all the bad press and the 
rumors that circle about her. Big 
deal. 

"We Didn't Start the Fire" is 
admirable in a historical way. Joel 
compiled some great lists of major 
events from the last 40 years. The 

song is seem ingly a clever response 
to R.E.M.'s popular release, "Ir's 
the End of the World (I Feel Fine)," 
in which the pattersong rhythm is 
emulated, and the lyrics are a sa-
tirical replication of the message. 

Next comes another "fast-for-
ward" tune, ". Go to Extremes," 
and finally the end of side one, 
"Shameless." This is a jazzy ballad 
rather untypical of Billy Joel, 
which is quite refreshing and per-
haps indicating a tum in his ca-
reer. 

I think the gradual segue into 
the jazz element is a wise choice for 
Joel as it complements his matura-
tion. He recognizes he is too old 
for boppy pop tunes and has the 
talent and experience to perform 
this style in a convincing way. His 
past work with Ray Charles is an 
obvious boon. 

The title song, "Storm Front," I 
call the "Robert Palmer" cut. It is 
probably the best on the album 
because it moves and uses synco-
pation in an interesting way. It is a 

Ii tde more jazzy than the rest of 
the album, and uses Eurythmics-
type harmonies in places. He shows 
a different style here even if it is 
not really his own. 

I t is the first time on the album 
that Joel displays the poetry that 
has characterized him as a brilliant 
lyricist. 

Joel, once again alone with his 
keyboard, closes the album gently 
and soulfully with much the same 
flavor of "Souvenir," the soothing 
tune thatclosedJoels'1974release 
Streedife Serenade. 

Unfortunately, Joel seems to 
write better material in the transi-
tory or sorrow-filled periods of his 
life; his struggling and desperation 
produced some of the best music of 
the last twenry years. 

His pain seems to give charac-
ter to his lyrics and heart to his 
music. Storm Front is an album 
that shows the struggling artist who 
has made it and is slowly starting 
to ferment. 

Perhaps Joel will tum around, 

incorporating more of the jazz 
element and producing a whole 
new style. Until then, my advice is 
to stick to "the n ice price."

6 HIATUS NOVEMBER 30 1989 

The group proceeded to release 
a series of albums, starting in 1983 
with Declaration. After two studio 
Lps and a live album, the band 
released their fifth and most re-
cent work, Change. It's a hard-
driving record filled with solid 
"rock n' roll" and "rhythm and 
blues" riffs. 

The new album was recorded in 
a flurry of four and a half weeks, 
the fastest album the Alarm has 
recorded to date. The majority of 
the album was recorded live in the 
studio, with a small amount of 
overdubs added later. 

We then started to talk about 
the Alarm's new album, Change. 
The title, MacDonald explained, 
"came purely through coincidence. 
Mike had written a poem called 
'Change,' and Dave had written a 
song called ·Change.'" 

I asked him whether or not the 
title meant a change in their fu-
ture, a direction they would like to 
go, or if it was a "one off thing." He 
responded by saying, "It's all in the 
songs. The songs preempt how you 
approach them. You've gotto make 
sure you do the right approach for 
the right song." 

After saying goodbye, I hung 
up the phone with MacDonald. I 
had the promise of an in-person 
interview and the hope of seeing a 
great show when the Alarm played 
in the gymnasium. 

****** 
Nov. 17 rolled around. I was all 

set to cover the Alarm and com-
plete this assignment on a high 
note when the boat was rocked. In 
the Nov. 16 issue ofthe Los Ange-
les Times, freelance reporter Craig 
Lee wrote a review of the band's 
Nov.14showatthe Wiltem Thea-
ter in Los Angeles. The article, 
which turned into a seemingly 
personal at tack on the Welsh 
quartet, threw quite a wrench into 
my plans. 

In his article Lee said, "The 
Alarm presents itself as such an 
overzealous, sincere bunch that 
seasoned rock observers might be 
forgiven for a quick lapse into 
cynicism when confronted by some 
of the group's more dramatic ex-
hortations." He then proceeded to 
call Alarm fans "youthful, like-
minded idealists." 

In what was probably the most 
unwarranted statement of the ar-
ticle, Lee asked the ignorantques-
tion, "Does lead singer Mike Pe-
ters really think he can help re-
solve his homeland'scultural iden-

tity crisis by taking the stage for a 
solo sung in Welsh?" 

This statement refers to a song 
Peters sings in Welsh in the middle 
of the show, which he hopes will 
symbolize the struggle to keep the 
Welsh culture from being washed 
over by modernization and prog-
ress. This draws me to ask 
one question. What does 
it mean to you when you 
sing the National An-
them, Mr. Lee? 

After Lee's generally 
harsh criticism of the per-
formance, the Alarm's 
tour people informed me 
that my post-show inter-
view was off. All the effo!,£ 
and only 50 percent re-

The lights drop for the second 
time in the UCSD gymnasium, 
which is packed with a full crowd. 
The lights then raise to reveal the 
Alarm, who burst into their classic 
hit "68 Guns." 

The show was non-stop action. 
The band ripped through theirnew 
material, as well as such recogniz-
able tunes as ''The Stand" and 
"Rain In The Summertime." The 
set was electrifying. The fans were 

Afterwards, a couple of specta-
tors commented on the show. "It 
was good, a great performance," 
said Steve De La Cruz, a Warren 
sophomore. 

Dan Shikiar, a Warren sopho-
more, also felt that "it was good."

to the birth of Jesus. The gallery 
features a straw depiction of this 
biblical search which, like many 
other pieces, is by an unknown 
artist. 

The celebration of Las Posadas 
is characterized by nightly pilgrim-
ages to Mexican homes and 
churches. The highlight of each 
day is the breaking of the piftata, 
which is typically made from clay, 
decorated with colored paper, and 
formed into familiar shapes such 
as animals. Inside the piftatas, 
children find candies and gifts. A 
traditional star piftata hangs in the 
gallery. 

As Callery explained, each 
work in the exhibit presents re-
gional differences among the art-
ists. 

''The crafts are from a number 
of states in Mexico," she said. "The 
same story is told over and over 
again, but it's told in very different 
ways using very different materials 
depend ing on what thepeople'have 
available to them and on the tradi-
tions in their regions." 

An unknown artist portrays the 
events of La NocM Buena, the 
good night, during which the na-
tivity is celebrated. At midnight 
on Dec. 24, La MisadelGallo, the 
mass of the cock, commemorates 
the birth of Jesus, followed by La 

F il e 

Acostada, the layingofthechild in 
the manger. 

While Dec. 25, La Navidad , is 
a day of rest, the following day is 
abuzz with activity. 

The holiday of Los Pas tares on 
Dec. 26 features the presentation 
of the miracle play. This dramatic 
oral tradition recounts the tale of 
creation, the fall of Lucifer , the fall 
of Adam and Eve in the Garden of 
Eden, and the formulation of the 
seven deadly sins. 

The actors generally wear masks 
of angels, devils, and shepherds 
during the play, at the end of which 
the shepherds pay homage to the 
Christ child. Masks by artist Her-
minio Candelario are included in 
the exhibit. 

Children receive gifts of folk 
toys on Jan. 6, El Dia de Los Santos 
Reyes. It is customary for children 
to write a wish list to the three 
kings and place it in their shoes, 
which are left by the window for 
the kings. Toys at the gallery in-
clude dolls, wooden puppets, and 
children's musical instruments. 

La Huida Egipto, the Flight to 
Egypt, is celebrated on Feb. 2. This 
holiday, which marks the last of 
the season, is represented in the 
gallery by an unknown artist's fig-
ures of the flight. 

"V.J.M. y J." stands for Vim
