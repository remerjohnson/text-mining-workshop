TAs, University Reach Labor Agreement 

• David Pilz/ Guardian 
~~ Gr~lJ(J~ student David G~ participated in last month's one-day teachin$ assistants' strike. The 
teachmg asszstants unum reached a tentatrve contract agreemtnt Tuesday night with the unrversiry. 

Tenta'tive contract awaits final 
approval by union members 
at eight UC campuses 
By VINCENT QRAGNANI 
News Editor 

The TA union and the University of 
California reached a tentative agreement on 
a labor contract late Tuesday night. The 
contract will go into effect once each party 
officially ratifies it. 

"ThiS is the culmination of a 17-year 
, campaign for a contract: said Christian 
Sweeney, a spokesman for the TA union. 
"We couldn't be happier about it. It's been a 
long, hard fight." 

UC President Richard Atkinson said he 
too was happy about the contract. 

"We are pleased to have reached an 
agreement with the union," he said. "The 
parties have worked long and hard to make 
compromises and craft a mutually agreeable 
solution." 

The tentative contract includes an esti-
mated 9.5 percent salary increase for teach-
ing assistants. This increase consists of an 
immediate 1.5 percent salary range adjust-
ment, in addition to the 2-percent increase 
provided in October 1999, followed by 
range adjustments in October 2000, 2001 
and 2002 that are anticipated to be 2 per-
cent each, depending on state allocations. 

The university, which now provi<;les 60 
percent remission of mandatory systemwide 
student fees for eligible graduate teaching 
assistants, will increase that figure to 75 per-
cent in fall 2000, 85 percent in fall 2001 and 
100 percent by fall 2002 . 

Other featu res of th e tentative deal 
include an agreement by the union not to 
strike for the duration of the CO ntract and 
the creation of an internal process that uses 
the Academic Senate faculty to resolve dis-
putes regarding the workload of academic 
student employees. 

"We believe this is an agreement that is 
fair to academic student employees, that is 
within the resources available to us and that 
recognizes the central role of the faculty in 
maintaining UC's standards of academic 
excellence: Atkinson said.

IyAUXJ. LEI 
Staff Writer 

Members of different faiths 
took part in "Th~ Hunger 
Awareness Die-In" at the Price 
Center Monday, campaigning for 
hunger and poverty awareness. 

Unni Malancharuvil, a member 
of the Catholic Community at 
UCSD, said organizers of the 
Hunger Awareness Die-In set~ut 
to accomplish two goals. 

"First, we wanted it to be a nice 
way for all the different faiths on 
campus to work together," she 
said . "We decided to promote • 

hunger awareness because it's 
such a universal issue ... leading to 
our second goal, making UCSD 
students more aware of the issues 
concerning hunger and poverty: 

The event began with the dis-
tribution of flyers titled "ways you 
can help in the fight against 
hunger: which included various 
phone numbers of contacts and 
organizations. 

Organizers said the flyers were 
an attempt to inform students.

College: 
Criminal case dropped 
against woman 
ContInued from ..... 1 

born, Roberts said no charges wIll be 
filed . 

"As soon as we received the med-
ical examiner's report and were noti-
fied that there was no viable chance 
that the fetuses could have lived, we 
closed the criminal case: Roberts 
said. 

RobertS added that the young 
woman sought medical attention. 

"The name of the suspect surfaced 
through interviews that we held in the 
residence hall ," Roberts said. 

The eighth and ninth floors of 
Lyon Tower were canvassed by 
investigators last week after the dis-
covery. 

Accordmg to an April 28 report by 
State Medical Examiner Jack Frost, 
the fetuses were stillborn. 

The fraternal twins, which were 
reported to be a Caucasian male and 
femal e, were approximately five 
months along in development. 

Frost also said that even if the 
twins were born in a medically sound 
atmosphere, they would not have sur-
vived. 

Roberts said that through DNA 
tests and other methods, they can 
identify the mother. 

A custodian discovered the fetuses 
in a commode. 

Upon the 7:45 a.m. discovery, 
university officials were called to the 
scene. Counselors were also avail-
able for students and staff to con-
sult.

Fate of Students Arrested 
In AnNweatshop Protest 

MADISON, Wis. - Anti-sweat-
shop protesters who were arrested 
Feb. 20 during a sit-in shared their 
views Monday with several adminis-
trators who will decide if they are 
deserving of academic probation. 

Of the 54 protesters arrested, 42 
were students, said University of 
Wisconsin student and arrested pro-
tester Riza Falk. 

Dean of Students Mary Rouse and 
Assistant Deans Jan Sheppard and 
Yolanda Garza listened to the stu-
dents to make their decision on 
whether academic probation is 
appropriate. 

During a Feb. 16 rally, over 80 UW 
students and Madison residents 
began a four-day sit-in to protest UW 
affi liation with companies that use 
sweatshop labor to produce 
Wisconsin apparel and merchandise. 

More specifically, protesters were 
upset over the lack of power they had 
in a shared-governance committee, 
the result of an agreement made with 
Chancellor David Ward that ended a

1ust Say Hi' Challenge to Be Held 
The Relationship Peer Counselors, spon-

sored by Psychological and Counseling 
Services, will be challenging students, staff 
and faculty to • Just Say HI!" to at least one 
new person this Friday between 11 a.m. and

ple to look at each other, smile and discover 
something new about another person. 

Peer volunteers will be handing out "Just Say 
Hi!' stickers along with tip sheets for approach-
ing another person on campus and starting a 
conversation. 

At noon on Friday, the Student Health 
Advocates will also host a Family Feud Game in 
the Price Center Plaza, in which students will be 
invited to participate In guessing the views of 
previously polled UCSD students on subjects 
ranging from sex to science. There will be prizes 
for the winners.

Contract:

CoIdII ... "... ..... 1 

Sweeney preferred not to com-
ment on specifics of the contract 
until it is ratified by union mem-
bers. 

Brad Hayward, a spokesman for 
the university, said the university 
will likely approve the contract. 

"There are some steps that the 
university needs to tak.e to formally 
ratify it, but that's not expected to 
be an issue: Hayward said. 

Sweeney said the union is cur-
rently scheduling dates for mem-
bers to vote on the contract. He 
also said it is likely to be ratified. 

"The bargaining team is recom-
mending it to membership: he 
said. "[ think that makes it very 
likely that it will be ratified." 

He added that the new contract 
contains provisions that will 
improve the quality of education 
offered to undergraduates .

At 4 a.m. on Feb. 20, police in

criminal charges were dropped, but

contracts, one for each campus. 

The talks were assisted by the

MOlienstern stepped in to medi-

The strike was called off and the

fine. 

Several weeks ago, students 
were contacted through letters ask-
ing for individual conferences to 
discuss possible penalization for 
their acts. 

According to Brigell, protesters 
still have not paid the fine and a 
trial is pending. 

If protesters are given academic 
probation, their transcripts will 
carry this designation for two years. 
The consequences would be more 
serious for a second offense. 

Rouse, Sheppard and Garla said 
they would try to reach a decision 
as soon as possible.

A.S. Executives 
Must Make Amends 

The UCSD Guardian is extremely disap-
pointed with A.S. President Tesh Khullar, 
Vice President Internal Jennifer Lee and 
Vice President Finance Eric Rovner for 
having left office last week without accept-
ing any punishment. from the A.S. 
Council. Furthermore, we request that the 
three exec utives formally and publicly 
apologize to students for falsifying receipts 
that were reimbursed with student money. 

Minutes after the A.S. Council passed 
(almost unanimously) a resolution 
demanding that the executives resign, 
Khullar, Lee and Rovner defiantly ignored 
that demand as they gave their weekly 
reports. It was only after numerous people 
- council members and non-council 
members alike - criticized them for not 
apologizing that the executives offered 
their apologies during the meeting. 

While it was encouraging to hear them 
apologize in front of a few dozen students, 
we realize that there are over 16,000 more 
students who deserve to hear those apolo-
gies. 

These exec utives represented and 
served the entire student body. They also 
deceived the entire student body, breach-
ing the trust placed in them as elected 
officials. 

Until this issue of forged receipts 
became public knowledge, Khullar made a 
point to send e-mails via student flyers 
informing students of what was going on 
in the A.S. Council. Now, however, the e-
mails have stopped. Khullar used to 
inform students of the positive things the 
A.S. Council was doing, but he is now fail-
ing to inform them of the negative things 
council members have done. 

While we appreciate the fact that 
Khullar has been more honest and open 
than Lee and Rovner, we find it deplorable 
that none of the three executives has made 
a deliberate effort to reach out to students 
and apologize. Whether it be in the form 
of a mass e-mail or a speech in the Price 
Center Plaza, Khullar, Lee and Rovner 
need to apologize to students outside A.S. 
Council for their action. 

Many on this campus feel that, after fal-
sifying receipts and attempting to conceal 
that falsification, Khullar should not 
address students at all-campus com-
mencement. 

Khullar and the other two executives 
are currently awaiting a decision from the 
university's judicial board regarding their 
fate. If Khullar receives no formal punish-
ment for his actions and fails to directly 
address students and take responsibility 
for what he has done, the Guardian feels he 
should not be afforded the privilege of 
addressing students at the all -campus 
commencement.

Ethnicity Is More Than Genetics; 
Upbringing Plays a More Important Role 
Defining one's cultural b~ckground is more complicated than merely taking the 
average of your parents' heritage or filling in a bubble on a questionnaire 

"ANIILAC~ 
Columnist 

At some point in your life, while loung-
ing in the shade of the family tree and 
admiring the beautiful leaf fonnations, the 
question will arise as to where the roots 
really began. Some may find it unne~ 
sary to trace back and dig deeper into the 
earth when there is the present time to 
manage, while others will eagerly grab the 
shovel and search for those precious roots. 

People's knowledge of their place of 
origin and ethnicity are rather imponant 
in establishing their identity. What are 
the roots of ethnicity? What are the 
components that make a person a certain 
ethnicity? 

Some may quickly answer that eth-
nicity is simply genetic. The genes from 
the father combine with the genes from 
the mother and make the genes of their 
offspring. The parents' ethnicities get 
split in half and the average is given to 
the child. Though this may be the case 
with some traits, I argue that it is not 
necessarily true with ethnicity. 

Ethnicity is in the mind. [f someone is 
told as a child that he is a particular eth-
nicity, then he will grow up thinking that 
he is of that ethnicity. 

When people ask what ethnicity he is, 
he will answer as he has been taught. 
When he fills in surveys or tests, he will 
mark the bubble as he has been taught. 
As he matures, questions may arise and 
curiosity may send him searching for 
answers, but for the most part, one's eth-
nicity is never questioned. 

Identity also has a great deal to do 
with nurturing and environment. The 
place where a child is raised and the peo-
ple that surround the child determine 
how he will think and view himself. 

It also depends on how the parents 
nurture the particular cultural traditions 
of a certain .ethnieity. If a child is brought 
up on partIcular foods and a particular 

- -'!a'!'l&'nlge thantd part of a culture, then it 

This is most difficult for 
people of mixed ethnicities. 
Which one will be the 
identifiable one? Which box 
will be marked on the 
questionnaire? Other? 
Coming from a mixed 
background myself, this is a 
subject that I have recently 
questioned. 
is more likely that the child will identify 
with that ethnic group. 

There are exceptions. There are 
instances when people attempt to lose or 
separate themselves from the ethnicity 
that they were born with. They might 
resent and ignore certain elements that 
make up that culture and instead 
embrace a new one. [n this process, they 
foster a new ethnicity within themselves. 

The opposite can also occur when 
people do not have an ethnicity to iden-
tify with - they may find one that they 
feel comfortable with and may try to 
insert themselves into that culture. 

The latter instance seems more diffi-
cult than the first because assimilation 

and integration are not always smooth 
processes. 

This is most difficult for people of 
mixed ethnicities. Which one will be the 
identifiable one? Which box will be 
marked on the questionnaire? Other? 
Coming from a mixed background 
myself, this is a subject that I have 
recently questioned. 

[ grew up under the impression that I 
was of many different ethnicities. I believed 
[ was a mutt, or a Heinz 57, as some peo-
ple like to call it. [ was told [ had ancestry 
that was Guamanian, Navajo, Basque, 
French-Canadian, Gennan and Belgian. 
That was my rather eclectic list. It was nice 
to think that I had ancestors from the 
Navajo tribe and when people asked if I 
were Hispanic. I could say that I was part 
Basque. [ identified with these roots and I 
embraced them wholly. 

Though only one-fourth Guamanian, 
that was the ethnicity with which I iden-
tified most. I suppose I chose this identi-
ty. because it was the most exotic and 
interesting and because [ visited the 
island as a child. 

Recently I found out that I was not, in 
fact, part Navajo or Basque. At first this 
was hard for me to grasp, but once the 
initial surprise faded the thinking began. 

[ had been positive of my heritage and 
identified with those ethnicities quite a 
bet. Even with the knowledge that I am 
not actually a member of these ethnic 
groups and thrat I am half Guamanian, it 
is hard to erase something that has been 
so etched into the mind. 

Were they a deception, all those years 
of my life when I thought that I was of a 
cenain background? [f I had never 
known the truth, [ would have still con-
sidered myself to be those ethnicities. 

I came to the conclusion that ethnicity 
is indeed something of the mind. If you 
truly believe that you are of that blood, 
then it is as if you really were.

Democrat HOUse Majority Ukely 
Unsatisfied public and a thin lead should worry House Republicans 
., TIM .IUD 
ChicilfO Maroon 

(U-WlRE) CHICAGO - With 
the Presidential race in limbo 
until at least the conventions, a 
potentially much more interesting 
set of races is shaping up. 

Currently, the Democrats need 
to only capture six seats in the 
House of Representatives to 
regain control there. 

It is interesting to note the 
thinness of the Republican lead 
and how that is affecting the strat-
egy in the Republican camp. The 
"Contract with America" is largely 
a dead expression in the new race 
for the House. The public has 
largely been dissatisfied with the 
work done by the House 
Republicans, culminating in the 
impeachment and trial of 
President Clinton. 

To counter it, all of the key 
races are being run on moderate 
grounds. The Washington Post 
reports that all of the candidates 
in th~ r9ughly 2S districts that will 
swinS the race for the House are 
runnmg moderate platforms. 

I can't help but wonder, 
though, whether it's possible for 
the RepUblicans to compete on 
moderate principles after recent 
examples of right-wing extremism 
emanating from the House of 
Representatives. 

There have been reports of far-
right House leaders (Delay of 
Texas pops into my head as the 
new poster boy for this group) 
pressuring moderate Republicans, 
to move fanher and farther away 
from the center. 

This whole uncompromising 
attitude seems to have hurt the 

credibility of the Republican 
regime, at least in my centrist Yiay 
o( thinking. 

But it is also clear to me that to 
break down the race for the 
House into this simple issue of 
credibility is overly simplistic. The 
Washington Post further reports 
that both parties have fielded can-
didates in these swing districts 
that really fit in well with the local 
mentality. 

This makes sense and further 
explains the shying-away from 
extremism on both sides. Most 
imponantly of all, though, all of 
these candidates are really going 
above and beyond the call o( duty 
in tenns of fundraising. 

A million-dollar House race 
has been a rarity in the past, but it 
seems that several will emerge as 
campaigning progresses. So far 
the Post reports that the 
Democrats have a slight lead in 
funding. but it will be interesting 
to see if and how that changes 
when major donors begin to real-
ize the importance of these races. 

But it seems to me that the 
Democrats are hungrier for the 
House, and their funding advan-
tage will increase. [ also think that 
people are looking for a change 
on Capitol Hill. and this will affect 
the dynamics in a way unfavorable 
to the Republicans. 

It makes sense that, based on 
the general distrust and petty pol-
ities in Congress, people might be 
hungry for a change, whether that 
change would have any real effect 
is up for debate, and that might 
just be the Republicans' best 
hope. 

It is also interesting to contem-
plate just what effect this battle 

for the House will have on the 
Presidential race. I think, if any-
thing. it will only invigorate it by 

addin~ another dimension to it, 
name!), this battle for the House. 

Assumedly, . many of these 
House candidates will be getting 
boosts from their party's 
Presidential candidates, and vice 
versa. Thus, [ predict an increas-
ing "nationalization" ofthese local 
House races, as local issues 
become overshadowed by nation-
al politics. This is unfortunate, 
because the whole point of 
Representatives is to come into 
the House to represent their 
home district. Hopefully, the can-
didates will be able to keep to this. 
Otherwise, I can see a lot of alien-
ated, or rather, even more alienat-
ed voters, upset at the copping-
out of local politics at the expense 
of national politics. From the Post 
article, it appears that this trend 
has not yet started, but with the 
implications at stake, [ don 't think 
things can stay that way. 

So, to conclude, the House 
battle is imponant this year, more 
so than in any year since 1994. I 
think that whatever happens, it 
will be very close. 

The Presidential race also 
looks close, and so, while these 
two races will feed off each other, 
they might not necessarily affect 
each other. 

[t may be that George W. Bush 
will win the Presidency, but face a 
Democratic House of 
Representatives. This would be an 
odd result, but, with the very tight 
House races, it might not be an 
unexpected one, particularly if 
voters vote for the candidate, not 
the party. 

Just in case 
the rock star thing 
doesn't work out.

Standardized Torture 
Graduate applications rely too much on test scores 
By lUll IIOOPIII 
Staff Writer 

The SAT is a rather distant 
memory. However the terror of 
feeling like a number determining 
my future is still fresh in my mind, 
lurking like an obnoxious ghost. 
After I filled in the last bubble on 
that stupid test, I thought my days 
of standardized testing and its bed-
fellow, anxiety, were over. 

Since kindergarten, I have been 
conscious of the lofty goal of col-
lege. Until graduation from high 
school, I organized my academic 
life around that goal. I am not the 
best test-taker, so it was a stressful 
process trying to gear up for the 
SAT. [ survived. When I stepped 
onto a college campus, I expected 
to feel relieved, free from pressures 
to do well in order to reach "the 
next level." 

Maybe it is masochistic of me-
though some would ca ll it ambi-
tious - but I have managed to cre-
ate a new next level: graduate 
school. There goes relief and free-
dom. Once again, I am haunted by 
standardized testing. 

Everyone has seen the flyers put 
up by Kaplan or Princeton Review, 
promising high scores on mysteri-
ous tests known only by their 
acronyms - GRE, LSAT, GMAT 
and MCAT (as if we don't have 
enough acronyms already clouding 
oUT minds). With scores on these 
various exams being a key part of the 
application process to graduate 
school, law school, business school 
and medical school, stuaents race to 
develop strategies to "beat" the test. 

[ recently wen t to a practice 
GRE workshop and the man in 
charge bluntly said, "The GRE 

does not test intelligence or worth. 
The only thing it tests is how well 
you can do on the GRE." 

[t seems primitive and petty that 
graduate schools. those institutions 
of supposedly highest learning, still 
conform to the notion of differen-
tiating students based on a single 
test that test administrators admit 
does not gauge one's ability to 
actually do well in classes. 

The other day, I happened to 
converse with a woman on the 
admissions committee fo r UCSD's 
undergraduate division. She said 
there are a lot of applications com-
ing in boasting 1600 SAT scores. In 
her opinion, after observing these 
so-called "perfect" students in 
action, their scores do not equate 
with an ability to master college 
courses. In fact , many are just good 
test-takers, often lacking writing 
abilities and other critical thinking 
skills. It is a mystery to me why 
standardized tests not only contin-
ue to be administered, but also 
continue to be regarded as the sole 
yardstick to measure students' abil-
ities. 

Of course, I realize that univer-
sities receive thousands of applica-
tions and need a simple, quantita-
tive way to distinguish student A 
from student B. However, admis-
sion boards should not adhere to 
the status quo and perpetuate the 
shattering of so many students' 
self-esteem just because they can-
not come up with another way to 
evaluate students. 

One would think that under-
graduate grades, personal essays 
and letters of recommendation 
would be sufficient in determining

UCSD Fire Marshall Calls for Assistance in Determining Cause of Accident 
Editor: 
Shortly before 7 p.m. on 

Saturday, May 7, 2000, a s~rin .kler 
in the west York Hall auditorium 
(room 2722) broke and began dis-
charging water. While I don't have 
a precise estimate of the damage 
caused prior to the water being 
shut off, there were (and will be) 
costs resulti ng from the occur-
rence. 

I need your help! It is highly 
unusual for a sprinkler to break in 
the manner this one did without 
there having been an outside 
force exerted on it . For example, a 
Frisbee was found in the room -
was this being thrown and conse-
quently hitting the sprinkler hard 
enough to cause it to break? 

It is much more important that 
I determine the exact mechanism 
by which this sprinkler failed. than 
try to punish anyone for what may 
have been accidental anyway. 
Anyone who witnessed the inci-
dent should contact me with 
details. Anyone who comes forth 
will be granted total immunity from 
recriminations of any kind. 

Information can be left on my 
voice mail, sent to my e-mail 
address or a note can be sent to 
me at Dept. 0920 - regardless of 
the method used, I promise 
Immunity - I just need the infor-

a student's potential. A score on 
the GRE (or whatever test keeps 
you up at night) just seems like an 
unnecessary nuisance. 

All that standardized tests have 
done is foster the growth of a huge 
test preparation industry that drains 
the bank accounts of already desti-
tute students. When all is said and 
done, the students who achieve high 
scores are often those who have the 
financial resources available to pay 
for a course to teach the tricks of the 
trade. Such tricks include recogniz-
ing vocabulary words that remain 
foreign to the majority who could 
not afford the course along with its 
coveted "words to know" list. 

Consequently, there is a bias built · 
into the whole standardized testing 
system, as those who are privileged 
to have the money for preparation 
courses have a greater probability of 
success compared to those who do 
not have the money. This prejudice 
defeats the whole (already shady) 
purpose of the GRE, which is sup-
posed to test raw skill. 

Considering the current system, 
if I want to go to graduate school, I 
suppose that I will have to fall in

Seattle Pacific University Begins Blocking 
Access to Pornographic Web Sites 
After monitoring Internet access for three weeks, university officials found 
that 6, 75 percent of all Web sites accessed were pornographic . 
The Falcon 

(U-WIRE) SEATTLE 
Associate Provost and Dean of 
Students Kathleen Braden 
describes herself as coming from a 
strong free speech, anti-censor-
ship background, but the statistics 
were too much for her. 

Three weeks of Internet moni-
toring by Seattle Pacific 
University at the beginning of this 
quarter revealed that 6.75 percent 
of all Web sites accessed were 
pornographic, with 21 percent of 
campus computers involved on 
an average day, according to 
Braden . 

"It isn't just apparently a few 
people here and there ... it's a pret-
ty widesprtad violation of our com-
puter _use policy," she said. 

SPU started blocking cam-
puswide access to sexually explicit 
and similar sites Thursday through 

Seattle~based company N2H2, 
according to Executive Director of 
Computer and Information 
Systems Dave Tindall. 

otification to the campus 
commumty went out Tuesday in a 
memo via e-mail from Braden and 
Tindall. 

Associated Students of Seattle 
Pacific officers and faculty council 
received notice of the decision a 
week ago. • 

Discussion of a filtering sys-
tem began four years ago when 
ASSP passed a resolution 
requesting such 3 mechanism, 

followed the next year by a reso-
lution seeking campus discussion 
of filtering , according to the 
memo. 

"We tried to think of other ways 
to deal with [the pornography 
issue) short of blocking,· Braden 
said. "It was very difficult to arrive 
at an alternative solution that was 
real istic." 

One proposal eventually 
deemed unrealistic called for plac-
ing a warning on a user's comput-
er screen when a pornographic 
site was accessed. The proposal 
did not recommend blocking such 
sites, which would be too intrusive 
and difficult to administer, Braden 
said. 

The agreed-on filter will block 
three categories of si tes: adults 
only, pornographic and sexually 
related material, with a few excep-
tions. 

"Our intent was to be quite 
selective and only filter on those 
categories where there would be 
widespread agreement on the type 
of criteria being used,· Tindall stat-
ed in an e-maIl. 

Many other schools block 
pornographic access only in certain 
areas, such as residence halls, but 
SPU decided to filter all connec-
tions on campus. 

"There are both technical and 
policy issues involved [in complete 
blockingJ," Tindall said. 

N2H2 was chosen to filter 
SPU's connection in pan because 
of price, reputation and suitability 
for college students, Tindall said. 

Installation of the filtering soft-
ware will cost the university about 
$4,000, with an extra $7,500 for 
annual maintenance of hardware 
and blocked sites. 

Before the decision to block 
access, Tindall stated that he saw 
reluctance on the part of SPU to 
install blocking software, but that 
sentiment has changed consider-
ably. 

"I think it was the period of sta-
tistical gathering that found a sub-
stantial level of content abuse on 
the part of campus students and 
staff [that changed the university'S 
view): Tindall said. 

Many other Christian universi-
ties use filtering technology, such 
as Northwest College in Kirkland, 
Calvin College in Michigan and 
Wheaton College in Illinois. 

Even producer George Lucas' 
film company, Lucasfilm Limited, 
uses N2H2 to filter ItS server, 
Braden said. 

Braden said that SPU President 
Eaton guaranteed that no punitive 
or judgmental actions will be 
taken against those who try to 
access pornographic sites, 
although periodic tests by CIS for 
pornographic site demand will 
probably occur. 

Braden encouraged opponents 
of filtering to attend the session, 
promising that their views will be 
respected and taken into 
account. 

"I don't want students to think 
that it's going to stigmatize them 
[for dissenting): she said.

U.N. Group Shifts Focus to Ethiopia-Eritrea Crisis 

ASMARA, Eritrea - A U.N. 
Security Council delegation visit-
ing Africa has abruptly shifted its 
attention from the crisis in Congo 
to the Ethiopian-Eritrean border, 
where hundreds of thousands of 
troops on both sides are preparing 
for imminent war, Western intelli-
gence reports state. 

With the crisis in Sierra Leone 
hovering over both regional prob-
lems, the Security Council decided 
in the past 24 hours to intervene 
in the Horn of Africa conflict, 
hoping to prevent an outbreak of 
fighting along the border. As the 
three crises have come together in 
the past week, the Security 

Council's unusual field trip to 
Africa has become more eventful, 
complicated and immediately pur-
poseful than any members had 
imagined, officials agreed. 

"When the trip was planned: 
said Richard C. Holbrooke, U.S. 
ambassador to the United Nations 
and the leader of the council dele-
gation, "Congo was the o. 1 cri-

Shuttling back and forth 
Tuesday between Ethiopia's capi-
tal, Addis Ababa, and the Eritrean 
capital, Asmara, the council mem-
bers were urging Prime Minister 
Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia and 

President Isaias Afwerki of Eritrea 
to consider seriously the conse-
quences of reigniting what one 
diplomat called "the stupidest war 
in Africa." 

Talks began on Monday night 
and are expected to continue 
through Wednesday. 

Since 1998, Ethiopia and 
Eritrea have battled sporadically 
over inland border territory at a 
cost of tens of thousands of lives. 
With a peace agreement brokered 
by the Organization of African 
Unity almost within reach, negoti-
ations broke down last week in 
Algiers. 

After reports that more 

troops, equipment and medical 
supplies were being moved to the 
border, the British and French 
ambassadors on the Security 
Council delegation proposed visit-
ing the two countries. 

"It is unacceptable that two of 
the poorest countries on earth -
one with 16 million people facing 
famine - should bring their 
troops to the border to prepare for 
war: said Holbrooke. "It's sense-
less. Completely senseless. The last 
war resulted in 50,000 deaths, and

But each country continued to

NIH Announces Full-Scale Tests of AIDS vaccine 
The National Institutes of 

Health is set to begin its first full-
scale tests of a vaccine for people 
already infected with the AIDS 
virus, the vaccine's manufacturer 
said Wednesday. 

I n the tests, injections of the 
vaccine, called Remune, will be 
added to standard combination 
drug therapy for HIY, the AIDS 
virus. Such drugs can halt repro-
duction of HIV in infected cells, 
but do not eradicate the vitus from 
those who are infected. Remune is 
intended to be a therapeutic vac-
cine, to stimulate the immune sys-
tem to destroy HIV-infected cells. 

The study aims at determining 
whether Remune will keep the lev-
els of HIV in the blood suppressed 
longer than anti-HN drug therapy 

alone and thwart progression of 
infection to AIDS. 

Vaccines are routinely given to 
prevent polio and many other 
infections. If the tests are success-
ful , Remune would be the first 
therapeutic vaccine for any disease 
to work in those already infected. 
But the vaccine is not expected to 
cure AIDS. 

The only full-scale testing of an 
experimental preventive HIV vac-
cine is being conducted in 
Thailand and the United States. 

Experts said that the odds are 
long for Remune to become a suc-
cessful therapeutic vaccine. . 

Other therapeutic HIV vaccines 
have been tested and found to be 
ineffective. Before combination 
anti-Hrv therapy was introduced, 

the U.S. military conducted a large 
full-scale test of another therapeu-
tic vaccine. Prolonged administra-
tion of the vaccine was safe, but did 
not benefit infected volunteers. 

Remune's manufacturer, 
Immune Response Corp. of 
Carlsbad, Calif., stopped a full-scale 
trial involving more than 2,500 
infected volunteers last year 
because a monitoring committee 
deemed it unlikely to provide statis-
tically significant findings to meet 
its primary objective, which was to 
measure disease progression to an 
AIDS-related condition, or death. 

Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the direc-
tor of the National Institute of 
AIlergy and Infectious Diseases, 
said his federal agency is undertak-
ing the new full-scale tests because 

it was important to test the concept 
that a vaccine could increase the 
benefit of anti-Hrv drugs in infect-
ed individuals. If the combination 
works, Fauci said, it could be par-
ticularly important for people in 
whom co.mbination drug therapy 
fails and could provide clues to 
which immune response is specifi-
cally associated with prolongation 
of viral suppression. Such a finding 
might also help in designing pre-
ventive HN vaccines. 

The new Remune study is 
expected to involve 472 volunteers 
at 40 centers in the United States, 
begin in a few weeks, and last 96 
weeks.

FTC Announces Record Company Antitrust Settlement 
WASHI GTON The 

Federal Trade Commission 
announced a settlement of an 
antitrust case against the nation's 
five largest music companies on 
Wednesday that, it said, should 
result in significant price cuts for 
compact discs. 

The settlement completed a 
two-year investigation of the com-
panies that officials said had 
uncovered illegal marketing agree-
ments that the music companies 
had used to end a price war and 
intlate the prices of compact discs. 
Agency officials estimated that 
consumers had been overcharged 
by about $500 million over the last 
four years. 

Robert Pitofsky, the chairman of 
the Federal Trade Commission, 
said the settlement would enable 
retailers to once again advertise 
deep discounts. He estimated that 
the savings to consumers could be 
as high as $17 million a month, or 
roughly $2 to $5 on many popular 
discs. 

Pitofsky said he had based the 
estimates on the heavy discount-
ing and price wars that took place 
before the music producers wrote 
the marketing agreements in the 
mid-1990s, sharply restricting the 
ability of retailers to advertise dis-
counts. 

The marketing agreements that 
the FTC said violated federal 
antitrust law were between many 
large and small retailers and the 
five music companies, which con-
trol 85 percent of the $15 billion 
CD market. The compal1les that 
settled the case were Time Warner, 
which earlier this year announced 
it had reached an agreement with 
the FTC; the Sony Corporation of 
America; Bertelsmann Music 

Group~_eMI Music Distribution, 
and Universal Music and Video 
Distribution. All of the companies 
have denied that the marketing 
agreements violated the law, and 
many of them declined to discuss 
the FTC's decision . 

Pitofsky said the agreements, 

known as "minimum advertised 
price" programs, or MAP, were 
implemented in an effort by the 
manufacturers to end a price war 
earlier in the1990s by such dis-
counters as Circuit City, Wal-
Mart, Best Buy and Target. 

The agreements between the 
music companies and the retail~ 
ers forbade music retailers from 
advertising discounts on CDs in 
newspapers, on television, or 
even on posters in the stores 
themselves. In exchange for 
those commitments, the music 
companies agreed to pay some or 
all of the advertising costs for the 
CDs. 

After initial agreements failed 
to curtail the price war, Pitofsky 
said, the producers toughened 
them so that they prohibited 
retailers from advertising discount 
prices even in ads that the retailers 
paid for. Pitofsky said the agency 
had discovered a memorandum 
sent by one industry executive 
describing the more restrictive 

program as "MAP with teeth." 
Commission officials said that 

in the few instances where the 
retailers violated the agreements . 
and advertised discounts, the 
manufacturers would temporarily 
stop making promotional pay-
ments, costing the retailers hun-
dreds of thousands of dollars or 
more. 

Government officials said that, 
although they had concluded that .' 
the agreements were un~easonable 
restraints of trade in violation of 
Section 5 of the Federal Trade 
Commission Act, they had decid-
ed not to seek fines. A variety of 
private lawsuits have been filed 
seeking financial penalties against 
the five music companies. 

The officials said the investiga-
tion into the marketing agree-
ments has had no bearing on the 
agency's review of a variety of 
industry-related mergers.

written a password-stealing pro-

of dollars of damage in at least 20 
countries over the past week. 

The list apparently includes the 
bank employee, Reomel Ramones, 
27, and his girlfriend, Irene de 
Guzman, who failed to turn herself 
in Tuesday as she had promised the 
National Bureau of Investigation. 

"The evidence is incomplete: 
said the senior prosecutor, Severino 
Gana. "There are still diskettes 
which they need to evaluate.' 

Investigators are hampered by 
the fact that a computer that could 
provide crucial eyidence appeared 
to have been removed from the 
home of the two initial suspects 
and by the lack of any law in the 
Philippines that makes computer 
vandalism a crime. 

An arrest warrant was issued 
under a law aimed at prosecuting 
credit card and bank fraud. Experts 
said Tuesday that prosecution 
under that law might be difficult. 

"There were no computers 
retrieved, but there were indica-
tions of equipment taken out; there 
were computer parts: said 
Federico 0pll1ion, the chief of the 
National Bureau of Investigation. 

Another bureau official, Elfren 
Meneses, said the names of the 10 
people under suspicion were embed-
ded in the virus, possibly in coded 
form, and that all had links with the 
AMA Computer College in Manila.

Two months after the end of

And after formally endorsing the

turned aside chances to inject more 
warmth into the situation. 

At one point, McCain was asked 
whether his endorsement should 
be likened to "taking his medicine." 

"I think your ' take the medicine

tion," McCain replied. 

And did he harbor any lingering 
resentment toward Bush from the 
sometimes nasty back-and-forth of 
the campaign season? "In politics,

Hand Guns: Fun For the Whole Family 
Despite negative messages conveyed by the media, firearms also provide a pastime for many student 
By UNDIAY SWORIKI 
Associate Hiatus Editor 

For some it is an appalling 
idea, but for others, an action-
packed pastime. Wh ther it is at a 
hoot1l1g range or a deserted 

desert patch, firing guns IS fun for 
many students. 

Last weekend, a gun-veteran 
friend and I went to the desert 
ilrea urrounding Joshua Tree 
with hi .22-caliber pistol, .22-cal-
iber rifle, .223-callber rifle, 9 mm 
pistol and a .357-ca liber Magnum 
revolver. 

I am from the city and had 
never even seen a real gun before, 
but his enthusiasm for the art of 
shooting piqued my interest. 
When he handed me his 
unloaded revolver before we left 
his apartment, I was scared to 
hold. it He assured me that J 
would get used to it in no time. 

For a brief second, I saw 
myself as the true Lara Croft, 
fully 3-D rendered, with holsters 
at my hip. However, I mostly had 
a vague dislike and mistrust of all 
weapons in general, especially 
weapons used 50 commonly and 
taken so casually. 

The thing is, I really did not 
know anything about guns or 
their mechanisms at all . I figured 
I might as well learn about them, 
shoot them and have an opinion 
that was somewhat founded. 

So, as we drove to the desert, I 
was given a crash course. The 
number given with the title of the 
gun indicates the lenKth of the 
gun barrel's or projectile's diame-
ter. All the guns listed above are 

indicated in inches, except for the 
9mm. 

The word "bullet " actually 
refers to both the projectile. the 
casing and the xplosive that is 
loaded into the chamber. There-
fore, the siz of the gun does not 
neces arity describe its power. 
For example, the .223-caliber rifle 
fires a much small r proj ctile 
than th .357-caliber Magnum, 
but the projectile travel at a 
much higher velocity because of 
the larger ca ing al)d gr ater 
amount of gun powder it can 
hold. Also, the length of the barrel 
and the wight of the gun can 
affect its speed as well. 

After passing dozens of mini 
strip maUs and gas stations on the 
desert highway, we finally 
reached the unpaved turnoff. We 
turned on the four-wheel drive 
and followed vague tire tracks 
into the sandy range for quite a 
while. Nothing was there except 
for an occasional rock, hill or 
shrub - and one pocked, desert-
ed and overturned car by the 
trail. 

We did not stop driving to add 
more bullet holes to the rotting 
frame, but as we went by I could 
imagine the satisfaction of shoot-
ing away at an object usually 
treated with such care (and much 
cash). NFuck you, car pay-
ments, insurance, tickets and 
auto-accidents! You were always 
an ugly color anyway! BLAM! 
BLAM!" 

I knew we arrived to the 
makeshift range when I saw the 
random, defonned toaster ovens, 
computer monitors and numer-

ous shards of broken glass and 
plastic littering the sand. This 
junk was left behind by the 
numerous people who came 
before us. My friend parked the 
car, unlocked his case of weapons 
and ammo, and went about set-
ting some targets. Par atop a little 
hill, he hung a few cans from a 
string and placed a reusable tar-
get that spun when hit. 

With the trunk open, my 
friend gave me a full tour of aU 
the guns, all their shapes and 
sizes. 

The rifle is a long-barreled gun 
that has rifling on the inside of 
the barrel. Rifling is a series of 
grooves machined into the inside 
of the barrel in a helical pattern, 
like the threads of a screw. These 
grooves cause the projectile to 

5H,.1 

spin as it exits the barrel, s tabiliz-
ing its trajectory. 

The revolver is a shorter-bar-
reled, hand-held weapon that 
reloads itself by revolving a circu-
lar magazine. A magazine is a 
container of bullets mounted on a 
gun that "feeds" the firing cham-
ber.

Gun: 
Psychological effects may prove 
costry far tlwse who choose to fire 
eon ....... ,.... ..... u 

The pistol is another hand-held 
weapon, similar to a revolver but more 
recently developed. It uses a magazine, in 
which the bullets are stacked on top of 
each other, designed to shoot people over 
a short range. 

He handed me the 9 mm. It was then 
that I realized how nervous I was. I 
wore ear protection, which is necessary 
to guard against the loud sound. My 
friend warned me that a discharged 
shell would come flying in my direction 
as the bullet ejected. I cocked the ham-
mer, took aim at one of the soda cans, 
put the gun back down in hesitation 
and picked it up again . I reminded 
myself that I was just out in the desert 
having some fun . 

What happened 
next is the 
strangest thing of 
all: I started to cry. 

I shot the gun, 
and the combina-
tion of pure physical 
shock and psychological 
programming pushed me over 
i.he edge. The loud booming noise that 
bounced between the hills, the jerk of the 

gun'~ kick and the flying shell that hit my 
forehead just scared the shit out of me. All 
I could thi.nk about were the images I had 
seen on television or in movies of people 
and animals being killed. It made me very 
sad. 

By the end of the day, I got used to it. I 
shot large rounds of rifle ammo at old CD 
players and even shot with a pistol in each 
hand at once. I realized that my strong 
reaction was not caused by the situation at 
hand, but by all of the movies I had seen, 
i.n which the sound of a bullet represented 
everything evil and sad or in which the 
sight of a gun was supposed to evoke 
i.ntense fear. 

Unlike others affected by the images in 
video games or action flicks, I had been 

Thursday, May 11, 2000 

influenced by genres that treated guns in . 
an opposite but equally biased and exag-
gerated way. There is only one reason 
guns are made: shooting animals and peo-
ple .. . but I was not personally killing 
Bambi's mother, either. 

BasicaJly, guns are not as they seem in 
the movies. If I had grown up around 
them I probably would have realized that. 
They are louder than they seem in the 
movies, yet at times are less dramatic. 
They are potentially more harmful, yet 
sometimes, in certain situations, less seri-
ous. I probably will not use a gun again 
for a while just because I do not plan on 
owning one and therefore do not have 
much incentive to spend the money to 
practice my aim. 

For others, this is not the case, and with 
extreme care and precaution, guns can 
become merely dangerous toys.

filled, perhaps not in the United 
States per Sf, but at least in the rest 
of the world. Electronica is becom-
ing a massive part of the musical 
culture, with trance and its cousins 
such as goa-trance, psychadelic-
trance and progressive- trance tak-
ing the world by storm. 

If readers have not noticed, take 
a look around - electronica is 
slowly creeping into television 
commercials, radio waves and par-
ties. 

Even rock bands are shifting 
toward more of an electronic feel. 
The Smashing Pumpkins who 
were one of the leaders of altema-
tive rock almost committed com-
mercial suicide when they released 
their album Adore, which was 
thickly coated with keyboard work 
and sampled drum beats. Garbage 
also pounds away with their style 
of heavy industrial electronica. 

Go to Tower Records and check 
out their growing electronic col-

lection. One will find TrcmctpOrt, 
TranctfmM' 2000, Trance Global 
Nation, Clubbtr's Guide to Trance, The 
Ministry of Sound Annual, and Club-
btr's GuiJe to !biza. However, one 
will also notice that these albums 
are all listed under the different 
headings of dance, techno, ambi-
ent, progressive-trance, house, 
hard house, happy hardcore, trip-
hop, jungle, drum 'n' bass, garage' 
and the list goes on . 

The Global Underground com-
pilation series has released over a 
dozen sets of CDs from the world's 
most reknowned DJs: Sasha in 
[biza and San Fransisco; Sasha's 
buddy John Digweed in Sydney; 
Paul Oakenfold in Oslo and New 
York; Nick Warren in Prague, 
Brazil and Budapest; and Dave 
Seaman in Buenos Aires. 

Keep searching and one will 
find ATB's album, MOllin' Melodies 
with the gigantic club hit, "9 p.m. 
(Till I Come)." BasementJaxx have 
impressed the public and the press 
with their album Remedy, on which 
they collect an array of sounds that 
hark back to the sounds of Span-
ish guitars and hard-thumping

basslines to create a unique and 
upbeat funky style of house. 

However. all this did not come 
from granny's kitchen . There is a 
rich history behind the electronic 
music of today. 
Wh.r. It All a. pn 

One can technically trace elec-
tronic music as far back as 1948. 
when avant-garde musicians Pierre 
Schaeffer and Pierre Henry wrote 
songs that were excl usively created 
from sounds recorded on tape. It 
was the one of the earliest forms of 
sampling. 

Advances in te hnology contin-
ued to push the envelope of music. 
The electric piano. built in 1958, 
and the Analog Moog Synthesizer. 
which was put into production in 
1967. paved the way for electronic 
music. 

In Germany during the 19705, 
groups such as Tangerine Dream 
and Kraftwerk set the foundation 
for the New Wave techno move-

ment during the 1980s. with 
groups such as Depeche Mode. 
New Order and OMD leading the 
new explosion of electronic music. 

The 1 980s also gave birth to 
many different forms of electronic 
music. Chicago House can be 
traced back to 1981. when Farley 
Keith gathering a group of radio 
DJs to form Hot MIX 5. They were 
Instrumental in the development 
'of the "classic' house sound of a 
repetitive keyboard line and a sim-
ple bass line. 

ver the years. DJs such as 
Jesse Saunders. Ron Hardy and 
Frankie Knuckles have become the 
Jedl masters of turntables in the 
Chicago house music scene. Up 
through the mid ·90s. groups like 
Ten City continued to push and 
strengthen the Chicago house 
sound ev n when the scene 
seemed to be dying down in the 
early '90s. 

Hip-house was a fusion of rap 
and house and was led by Africa 
Bambaataa. bur it slowly died out 
in 1991 . However. it lived on 
through pop house hits by Snap 
and 2 Unlimited.

History: 
New Order helps create 
I drug music' 
eonun.ed frOIIt ..... 14 

New York club music emerged 
on the scene in 1986 with an up-
tempo house beat from samples of 
'70s disco music. The New York 
club and the New York garage 
house scene (which is the original 
version of deep house) blended 
together in the early '905. 

"Techno" is probably the most 
recognizable form of electronic 
music. Techno spawned from the 
depths of Detroit and emerged 
with pure beats and a solid sound. 
DJs such as Kevin Saunderson, 
Derrick May and Juan Atkins 
spearheaded the most popular 
electronic movements. Techno in 
Detroit built off the electronic 
sounds of Kraftwerk and was both 
influential on and influenced by 
Britain 's new wave scene. 

In 1987. the United Kingdom 
electronic music scene kicked off 
in clubs like the Hacienda in Man-
chester. Some may consider this 
the: birthplace of the modern-day 

"rave' and the revival of Methyl-
ene-dioxy-methamphetamine or 
MDMA. better known as ecstasy. 
The city that was home to the self-
loathing, indie-rock sou~d of Joy 
Division and The Smiths also 
spawned the early beginnings of 
the euphoric sound that ultimately 
powered the rave scene. 

After Joy Division frontman Ian 
Curtis killed himself. the rest of Joy 
Division returned as New Order. 
Ne\\- Order steadily moved away 
from the indie-rock scene and 
became one of the leaders of tech-
no as they scored a Top 30 hit in 
1982 with the early club anthem 
"Temptation." 

New Order embraced the 
emerging club culture by becom-
ing joint owners of Hacienda and 
releasing their album. Power. Cor-
ruption and Lies. which yielded one 
of the greatest dance hits of all 
time. "Blue Monday." 

By this time. ecstasy and acid 
were among the drugs used by 
members of New Order to help 
create fantastic "drug music. ' This 
started the synthetic connection 
between electronic ,music and

The rave scene continues to 

grow, With different styles of music 
growing and blending into each 
other and other styles reviving 
themselves. House music made a 
come back with Everything But the 
Girl, Daft Punk and more recently 
with Basement jaxx taking House 
to a fantastic new level. 

Stardust's "The Music Sounds 
I B tler WIth Y u· continues to be 

one f Ihe greatest hOllse songs 
ever written . Trip-hop groups such 
as Tricky and Morcheeba offer a 
dark and mellow type of music 
perfect for any "comedown" with 
mc;andering drum beats, hypnotic 
keyboards and a beautiful female 
vocal over everything. Rela tively 
slow and sweeping music describes 
the feeling of ambient music as 
heard in Air's mellow groove. 

The worldwide club favorites 
are found under the general head-
ing of trance. DJs such as Sasha 
and john Digweed offer seamless 
mixes of different records created 
by different producers from 
around the world like Sander 
Kleinenberg and Orbital. Paul 
Oaken fold's more recent effort, 
Trrmceport Vol. 1 has sold more than 
any other compilation album. 

Paul van Dyk, who has always 
been a favorite ajong ravers, has 
also produced an mixed his share 
of fantastic music found on nearly 
every compilation that the record 
label deems essential. 

ATB and Chicane offer a beau-
tiful blend of a techno and trance 
sound that proves to be the perfect 
match in the club scene around 
the world. The steady beat, lush 
piano work and the wave of synths 
that wash over the entire song is 
what makes trance. 

American-born Djs such as BT 
have created beautiful, sweeping 
soundscapes that are heavily influ-
enced by the British trance scene. 

In retrospect, it does seem as if 
electronica will fulfill the prophesy 
and take over the world. More 
artists arc beginning to add a sim-
ple house beat under their songs, 
instantly finding thfmselves with a 
top-40 hit. 

Madonna once said , "Techno 
equals death." That was two years 
before she recorded Ray of Light. 
Celine Dion found the producers 
of the Backstreet Boys and the next 
thing you know, her new album is 
laced with a dance beat.

Imagine a beat, a drum 'n' bass

samples from serene rainforests to 
multi-orgasmic porn flicks. Com-
plicate the sound some more with 
backwards analog-synthesizers and

Not feeling it? 
The static soul need not worry 

though. Irwin and his Conspiracy

Despite his shy disposition, 
Irwin has played with the likes of 
Dave Navarro of jane's Addiction, 
Wilt Cooper of Mazzy Star, and 
Carl Denson of Lenny Kravitz. His 
work with numerous CDs and 
electronic compilations is equally

History: 
Electronic music is . 
constantry renewing itself 
whatever, look around todays 
music scene. Electronica has 
grown from its roots in Detroit, . 
Chicago and the United Kingdom 
and has grown to spawn many dif-
ferent variations and blends across 
the world. Like it or not, electron-
ica has steadily infused itself into 
the music world and can now be 
found in the mainstream. 

fundy? Not quite yet, because 
the number of !lew DJs, songs and 
wide variations of music constant-
ly appears in the underground 
music scene. 

Electronic music is constantly 
renewing and reinventing its 
sound, keeping itself on the cut-
ting edge of music. 

So this begs the question: Is 
rock dead? 

Not quite, but electronica is 
definitely alive and rolling along 
quite well.

Tennis: 
Tranckino, Olsen and 
Tadlock look to pave way 
eo.e.. .. fr'OIa ..... 22 
nationals. If we playas we expect at 
regionals. our top competitors at 
nationals will be Thnity, Amherst 
and Williams. We have beat Amherst 
and though we lost to Williams. 
Amherst beat Williams. This means 
that we are right there with the other 
teams and that we are very capable 
of being No. 1. We hope to play 
Thnity again at nationals. because 
we know that we could have beaten 
them. We lost some very close third 
set matches. such as myself who lost 
6-4 in the third." 

Tranckino is also optimistic 
about many aspects of the upcom-
ing nationals competition, 

"We are anticipating a great 
turnout at nationals because we 
know that we are capable of being 
very tough competition for our 

Track: 
Tritons look to hold their 
oWn against top schools 
ContINI ... frOlll ..... 24 
championship meet. 

Fans should look for senior 
standout Jim Freeman to tum in 
some especially impressive scores. All 
season long, Freeman has been 
counted on to come through In his 
multiple events, and he has dehvered. 

"Freeman was looking for a place 
to come and get a quahty education 
at a university that, while excellent 
academically, also offers a strang 
athletic program." Salerno said. 

Luckily for the team , Freeman 
found what he was looking for at 
UCSD, as he is com~ting in five 
different events thiS weekend, 
including the discus and javelin 
throws. He looks to contribute 
quality placings in each. 

The Thtons are also hoping for a 
big day from James Nielson, who 
will be defending last year's champi-
onship finish in the 5000 meter and 
will compete in the 1500 as well . 

Roger O'Keefe, panicipating in 
five events this weekend, is looking 
to see his hard work payoff. 
O'Keefe is panicipating in both 
relays, in addition to the long jump 
and intermediate hurdles. If dili-
gence and effon were a scoring 
event, O'Keefe would come out on 
top, according to Salerno. 

"O'Keefe is one of the hardest 
working guys out there." Salerno 
said. "His work ethic is just phe-
nomenal and it shows in the meets.· 

On the women's side, speedy

opponents. Our team has incredi-
ble depth, and if we play up to our 
potential, there is no stopping this 
team at nationals. • 

Sophomore Lyndsey Tadlock 
bdievrs the team is fired up for a 
great weekend of play. 

"Our main focus these past two 
weeks has been to nationals, so 
we've worked really hard on the 
coun and off to prepare for the last 
two weeks of the season." Tadlock 
said. "Our most important match 
of the year is on Saturday, and I 
believe that we are prepared to win 
there and continue on to nationals 
in Minnesota: 

Freshman Melisa Liao is con-
vinced that the future holds well for 
the UCSD women's tennis team. 

"We've been preparing for 
nationals and regionals since 
October, so now it's time to play well 
when it really counts,· Liao said. 
"We've been working hard, even 
having night practices in addition to 
our afternoon ones. so I have no 
doubt that we ~iIl do great: 

Jessica Shugan is being counted on 
for some high-scoring finishes, as 
she will compete in the 100, 200 
and both relay events. 

Jodi Waltz will be in the house 
this weekend as well, along with 
Megan Steele, who is skilled in the 
throwing events. 

This meet will be extremely 
challenging for the Tritons. as they 
are the only Division III ream par-
tiCipating, and the competiti n is as 
stiff r suffer than any they have 
faced In the past. 

Top programs will compete, 
including Cal State Dominguez 
Hills and Chico State on the 
women's side and the dominating 
UC Davis squad on the men's side. 
The Tritons are till looking to 
make their presence felt on the 
tracks and Infields of UC Davis. 

"These are all top Division II 
schools that are able to draw some 
exceptional athletes with scholar-
ships and all, but we have a good, 
hardworking team and are looking 
to place in the top five in both 
men's and women's competition." 
Salerno said. 

' The Thtons have been improv-
ing steadily all season, and that has 
not changed at this week's prac-
tices. The big meet that is looming 
ahead has not seemed to affect the 
effons of the Triton athletes, who 
are simply going about their daily 
routines, preparing themselves 
mentally and physically. 

"The athletes all have this air of 
confidence about them." Salerno 
said, "and are even a bit jaded after 
holding their own against the 
toughest competition in the west-
ern [United States):

because if you had to play against 
her, you had to work very hard. 
That helped everyone on the 
team. If she were guarding you 
during practice, you probably 
wouldn't score on her or would 
have to work to score on her. She 
helped everybody on the team 
improve because you had to work 
very hard against her." 

Leu did not initially join. 
"I started out playing in inter-

murals my first two years," Leu said. 
"I wanted to take a break from bas-
ketball coming from high school. I 
didn't really look to playing for the 
team. 1 got to know some girls on 
the team my sophomore year. 1 had 
a lot of fun playing with them, and 
playing with them offered a nigher 
level of competition than imermu-
rals did. My junior year, [ decided to 
give it a try. 

Leu turned out to be jewel. 
"She mostly played [recre-

ational basketball] her first two 
years," Malone said. "S he was 
concentrating on school. She 
played with a lot of our players." 

"When we had open (recre-
ation]. they would call her up and 
have her play," continued Malone. 
"They came to me and said 'Why 
don't you recruit Amy Leu and see 
how she will fit?' She had been 
out of basketball for a couple of 
years and [recreation] basketball 
and intercolle~iate ball are two 
completely different things. I 
think if we had her all four years, 
she would have been an impact 
player for us." 

Ernsberger was brought to 
UCSD by many influences. 

"A lot was because of the bas-
ketball ," Ernsberger said . "[ 
would have an opponunity to 

play. [ talked to the coach a lot. [ 
had a friend on the team here, 
Tristen Teasdale - that was kind 
of an incentive to co me. 
Familiarity, closer to home and 
it's a gorgeous area." 

Ernsberger had a good recom-
mendation when she came to 
UCSD. 

"She was a teammate ofThsten 
Teasdale: Malone said. "She 
helped us recruit Marci by saying 
what good it would be having her 
on our program." 

UCSD did not have to pursue 
Turnbull - she pursued UCSD. 

"She kind of recruited us. She 
wanted to go to school here. We 
saw her play. One of my assistants 
actually liked her sister better, but 
here's the difference: Kate is one of 
those people that has intense forti-
tude. (She is] just very gutsy. [f you 
gave her a challenge, she was going 
to come out of it no matter what." 

Turnbull decided UCSD 
would be the right choice for her. 

"First coming to college, I was 
tired of basketball," Thrnbull said. 
"I had two knee surgeries in high 
school. My high school coach told 
me to tell UCSO that 1 played. 1 
played in a summer league and 
Coach Malone invited me to go to 
Australia with the team." 

Post graduation plans are 
numerous. 

"[ think I'll be taking some time 
off. maybe looking for a job, work-
ing for a year," Leu said. "[ hope to 
apply to maybe some physician 
assistance school or maybe even 
medical school, but that will be way 
off. Maybe not playing, like there 
are professional leagues. [ volunteer 
in the athletics training room right 
now and [ enjoy that a lot. That 
could possibly lead to participating 
in professional sports as a trainer, 
not playing." 

Turnbull wants to educate oth-
ers, but in the basketball sense. 

"I'll be working this summer and 
then working toward my teaching 

The UCSD Guardian 

credentials this fall," Turnbull said. 
"[ want to be an elementary school 
teacher, fifth or sixth graders." 

Ernsberger accepted her role 
once returning from a mid-season 
injury. 

"Being on the bench was a lot of 
fun," she said. "You get to concen-
trate on supporting others instead 
of worrying about your own game. 
[t was a coach-like role in the emo-
tions of it. You see it more on the 

. bench than when you're playing. 
It's definitely put an interesting 
twist on the view. Our team was 
just awesome this year in stepping 
up. So many people stepped up 
individually. With the up and 
downs we had, we were always suc-
cessful. We played well as a team. 
When we played well as a team, we 
were unstoppable." 

There were many experiences 
on the team. 

"You learn a lot of teamwork," 
Leu said. "You learn to compro-
mise and to work together. Every 
year, there will be new players and 
you have to change the style of play. 
You learn to be really flexible." 

Memories abound for the 
depaning. 

"['ve enjoyed it enough for 
myself, but rve never been the type 
of person that played for myse[f," 
Ernsberger said. "It's incredible 
how strong and diverse your 
friendships can be with such a 
diverse group of people that you 
spend so much time together with 
and get along (with] so well . Road 
trips were a blast. They were a 
bonding time. We got to take some 
really fun trips over the years." 

The Tritons will have to learn 
to live without these three stars. 

"Their spirit was the spirit of the 
team," Malone said. "We were 
tough, mean and aggressive. and [ 
think that was because of the inten-
sity of Kate and Marci, and throw in 
the work of Amy Leu because of 
her tenacity. It still fails to be ser.fl if 
next season we can carry that on."

Great Season Earns 
'ennis Home Berth 
UCSD to host the women's tennis regional 
qualifying tournament for the first time 
IJ AIM .. VAiAN 
Staff Writer 

After 19 long, arduous games 
facing the toughest teams Division 
III can offer, the UCSD women's 
tennis team is set for its upcoming 
regional tournament. The team will 
be hosting the first round and will 
face the winner of Claremont 
College against the University of 
Redlands on Saturday at 2 p.m. at 
the North Courts. 

The breakdown of the regional 
tournament is as follows. On 
Friday at 2 p.m., No. 3 seed 
Claremont from the Western 
Region will face No. 5 University 
of Redlands. On Saturday at 10 
a.m., the winner will play the sec-
ond-seeded Tritons. 

Thnity University will host 
Pomona-Pitzer in Texas for the 
other semifinal match. The two 
winners will advance to the 
National Championship, on 
May 19, at Gustavus Adolphus 
University in Minnesota. 

Only the top two teams from 
each of the four regions will com-
pete for the national title. 

Following the team champi-
onship, there will be an individual 
tournament for the top 32 Singles 
players and a competition for the 
top 16 doubles teams in the coun-
try. Although they have not been 
chosen yet, it seems clear that 
senior Amy Tranckino will play sin-
gles ~nd hopefully junior Kirsten 
Olsen and sophomore Lyndsey 
Tadlock will panicipate in the 
doubles section. 

u 
iNd. 

Head Coach Liz laPlante com-
mented on the new setup of the 
regional tournament. 

"This is the first time women's 
tennis has held a regional qualify-

in~ to get into nationals," LaPlante 
said. "[n the past, the top 14 teams 
went to nationals. Unfortunately 
with this new.system, fewer teams 
get to go to nationals; and the draw 
is automatically set for certain 
regions to compete, regardless of 
performance during the year." 

LaPlante predicted a positive 
outcome. 

"Assuming we defeat 
Claremont, we will play Gustavus 
at the first round, the No.1 team 
from the midwest. The winner will 
play Amherst, No. 2 from the 
east," she said. "With only the top 
eight teams, there is no easy draw, 
but we have a good chance to get 
to the finals if we play well , since 
we defeated Amherst early in the 
year." 

"Everyone is playing very well, 
with no serious injuries," the 
coach continued. "We'd love to 
have a big crowd for our match on 
Saturday." 

Senior Amy Thnckino said the 
team's chance to get to nationals is 
within reach. 

"Through our hard work. we 
have placed ourselves in a good 
position for nationals and we have 
learned from our two close losses 

.{against Trinity and Williams] ," 
senior Tranckino said. "Regionals 
will be another step to our goal for

Softball Squad Prepares for 
Regionals This Weekend 
UCSD confident in facing the likes of Chapman, 
La Verne, Trinity College and Pacific Lutheran 
IIj lOBIin' FULTON 
Sports Editor 

The UCSO softball team has 
earned a birth in the West 
Regional Championships, which 
will take place at Chapman 
University this Friday through 
Sunday. 

UCSD will be one of four 
teams taking part in the tourna-
ment. 

The other three reams, besides 
third-seeded UCSD and first-
seeded host Chapman, are second-
seeded Pacific Lutheran 
University, founh-seeded Trinity 
College and fifth-seeded 
University of La Verne. 

UCSD will open the double-
elimination tournament against 
Pacific Lutheran University Friday 
at 2 p.m. 

The Thtons will be greeted by 
some new faces, having never 
played Pacific Lutheran before. 

"We know that they're a good 
team," UCSD Head Coach Patti 
Gerckens said. "I've seen them play 
a couple of times during the year. 
They have some good pitching. I've 
seen them play and they are a good 
team, but we're focusing more on 
our strengths. That's our goal. 
They're very beatable and it can 
happen ." . 

Gerckens knows her team has 
what it takes to win. 

·We know what we can do and 
if we go out there and just play our 
game. we can beat them," Gerckens 
said. · We don't have to play the 
best game of our lives. We just have 
to play our game." 

The team is looking forward to 
opening the tournament. 

"We're glad that we're playing 
them first,· Gerckens said. · We 
play really well in the first games. 
First of all, [ think we're a good 
tournament team. It's going to be 
the first game of the day and we're 
definitely going to be up for it." 

UCSD enters the tournament 
with a 12-11 record. Pacific 
Lutheran sports a 34-5 mark. This 
does not worry Gerckens. 

"They played all Division III 
teams," Gerckens explained. "We 
played NAlAs and Division 11 ." 

The playoffs will be a new expe-
rience for many of these Tritons. 
Although only the seniors have 
playoff experience, Gerckens is still 
not worried. 

"Our seniors were in regionals," 
Gerckens said .• [ think we're a very 
mature team. I don't think that's 
going to be an issue." 

UCSO's confidence stems from 
knowledge that Leea Harlan will 
be taking the mound in the first 
game. 

"She's been our No. 1 all year," 
Gerckens said. 

The Tritons fell to Chapman 
this last weekend 4-2 and 5-1. The 
4-2 loss was all but wrapp d up by 
the Tritons, but the team lost a 2-0 
seventh-inning advantage en route 
to defeat. 

The other teams, La Verne and 
Trinity, do not seem to be much of 
a problem for UCSD. 

· We played La Verne three 
times and we won all three,· 
Gerckens said. ·We played Trinity 
last year and we beat them."

My Search for Cable 
Television 

This weekend, my wonderful 
L.A. Lakers were (GASP!) forced to 
play a fifth and deciding pla~off 
game against the eighth-seeded 
Sacramento Kings. I was shocked, 
flabbergasted and above all, dis-
tressed. 

See, earlier this year I had pre-
dicted, like so many others, that the 
Lakers would waltz away with the 

SA title this coming June. On top 
of that, I had talked boldly to my 
fellow sports editor on what the 
Lakers' accomplishments would 
be. His money is on Portland this 
season, and if the Lakers had fallen 
to the Kings (THE KINGS!) in the 
first round, I would not be able to 
brag about my beloved Shaq and 
Kobe, et al. for a long time. 

So the setting was crucial, and I 
had to watch. Problem was, it was 
being aired on TNT on Friday 
night , and I do not have cable. 

Why don 't I have cable? Two 
reasons. The first is that I really 
cannot afford the 40 or SO bucks 
for the privilege. I figure the money 
could best be used buying dinner 
or maybe gas or textbooks. 

The second reason I do not 
have cable is because it would be 
too much of a distraction. Hell, the 
Internet takes up more of my time 
than it should. Throw in cable, and 
I would be a blathering fool. I 
mean , who can resist two channels 
of C-SPAN and log-cutting con-
tests on ESPN? No one. 

So, I do not have cable, and the 
Lakers were playing a crucial 
game. I decided to remedy this by 
heading to a bar. I figured I could 
watch the game and have a few 
drinks. 

I do not drink too much, and 
even though I live in PS, I do not 
know the bar scene too well. 

I started walking toward down-
town PS and I came upon a bar and 
grill. I stuck my head in and looked 
around . There were televisions 
showing basketball, but the place 
was too crowded, so I decided to 
look for a less public place. 

I went to another bar, and this is 
what set me off. I stuck my head in, 
and there, on all the televisions, was 
a hockey game! 

Now, hockey is a good sport and 
it has had some excellent matches 
as of late. Although it is playoff 
time, you cannot imagine my sur-
prise when I saw hockey on the 
screen instead of Shaq throwing 
down a monster slam. 

This is southern California and 
the Lakers are on television. The 
Lakers are the only pro team in our 
neck of the woods. (No, the 
Clippers do not count.) This is 
playoff time and it was a deciding 
game. Hockey? 

Disgusted, I moved on to 
another establishment. This one 
had baseball on its multiple televi-
sions. Now, I love baseball, but 
the same things apply to the first 
bar. Where was my Kobe? My 
Rice? Again disappointed, I 
moved on . 

I eventually found a place and 
only missed a segment of the first 
quarter. I had a few beers, enjoyed 
the 30-point win and walked home. 
I hope to do this again soon, but I 
do not want to be hindered by 
hockey or baseball when Shaq and 
the crew are looking to blowout 
their next opponent.

Graduation Beckons Three of UCSD's Finest 
Women5 basketball Lspirit of the team' to be missed with the departure of Ernsberger, Turnbull and Leu 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

Three members of the UCSD women's bas-
ketball team are dribbling off into the sunset 
this June. Marci Ernsberger, Kate Turnbull and 
Amy Leu are all &,raduating, concluding their 
UCSD basketball careers. 

UCSD is losing much with these depar-
tures. 

In Ernsberger, a forward, the team is losing 
more than just an athlete. 

"Everybody needs a player like her; 'Triton 
head coach Judy Malone said. "She doesn't 
stand out in the stats. She's always kind of 
down there in scoring and down there in 
rebounding, but she does a lot of little things. 
(Shel steals and throws her body around and 
has had some spectacular dives over the four 
years of keeping the ball in bounds or stealing 
the ball from somebody." 

Ernsberger's honors are numerous. She was 
named the team's most inspirational player and 

outstanding student this season. She finishes 
ei~hth in career blocks with 19, 11 th in steals 
With 103 and 17th in assists with 145. 

"She won our heart and hustle award for 
three years in a row basically for how hard she 
works on defense; Malone said. "She was 
never an outstanding offensive player, but she 
was always an outstanding defensive player. 
She would score when we needed a score on 
offense, but we didn't look for her to be the 
leading scorer of the game." 

Upon leaving, forward Thrnbull will take a 
lot of the team's leadership with her. 

She ranks third in career blocks with 38 and 
fifth in single-season blocks with 19. She was 
named rookie of the year her first season, and 
was named co-MVP and earned leading 
rebound honors her second year on board. 
Her junior year, Turnbull was named best 
defensive player and leading rebounder. Her 
final year, she garnered most inspirational and 
MVP honors. 

"She's very competitive; Malone said. "Her 

competitiveness almost carried us the last four 
years. She's very intense on the floor ... She got 
hurt this year and still earned team MVP even 
though she missed nine or 10 games in the 
middle of the season. It wa~ just because of her 
kind of attitude which was the epitome of this 
team. Kate was listed as 5'10" and she's maybe 
5'7.5", and she guarded people who were 6'2", 
6'3" . You could always count on her shutting 
someone down." 

Though Leu, a forward, did not get much 
playing time, she was one of the hardest workers 
on the court. 

"She has outstanding hustle and works 
hard in practice; Malone said. "She under-
stood what her role was and accepted it. She 
was the prototypical team player. She kept 
working hard. It wasn't like she gave up 
because she wasn't getting any playing time. 
She kept working hard and improving. She 
pushed everybody else and you played better

Triton Track Tunes Up at Steve Scott Invitational 
Irvine trip is nothing more than a preliminary for the California Collegiate Athletic Championships 
By ICon BURROUGHS 
Staff Writer 

A few key athletes from the 
UCSD men's and women's track 
squads worked on perfecting 
their techniques last weekend at 
the Steve Scott Invitational. 

This event, held in Irvine, was 
an invite-only event, bringing 
together some of the premier ath-
letes in collegiate track and field. 
UCSD exhibited strong signs of 
progress and ability at the match, 
with the highlight being fresh-
man Jodi Waltze performance in 
the women's pole vault. 

Walsh set a UCSD school 
record en route to her NCAA 
qualifying mark of 11.6. 

Salerno confident. 
"We've performed well recently, 

and you can definitely see the 
progress that has been made; 
Salerno said. "The invitational was 
really just a chance to tune up for 
the big meet this weekend." 

The big meet Salerno is refer-
ring to is the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association 
Championships, which will take 
place at UC Davis. The meet, 
besides the inclusion of UCSD, is 
comprised entirely of Division II, 
scholarship-offering schools. 
This is a challenge the track 
squad eagerly anticipates.

mance in the team's last few 
meets has Head r:oach Tony
