This year's referendums: 
debatable issues 

tates Chris Harrington , Koala editOr, 
"We are in favor of it because we think it 
will PUt us on more of an even keel with 
some of the other publications. 

"We're looking at how popular we [(he 
Koalal are, compared with other papers , 
and we feel we can get enough money. 

"Papers should be more responsible, as 
far as supporting themselves. We got 
about $5 ,000 from AS this year. and we 
sold about $1.000 in ads." 

By SEAN WAGSTAFF 
The Guardrail has compiled a list of 

referendums on the AS ballot. with some 
op inion concernlllg lhe pros and cons 
of these items: 

COMPUTER PROFICIENCY 
Are you in favor of maki ng profiCiency 111 
at lea t one computer language a 
graduation requirement? 
-Con 

Henry Fischer. director of the 
Computcr Science Center, states that this 
referendum is a waste of time and 
money. 

"The main use of computers in the 
University and community is utiliZing 
pre-packaged programs such as 
spreadsheets and word processors. 

"Unless a person is going to be a 
computer programmer or have a specific 
purpose for programming knowledge, 
there's no reason for it. 

"Three hundred students learning 
BASIC la computer languagel in a class 
lie up most of a VAX 750. 

"Knowing BASIC doesn't mran you 
know how to use a word processor." he 
says. 
- Pro 

The positive aspect of being profiCient 
in a programming language, according to 
Fischer, IS that the limited computer 
familiarity necessary to many people 
would be acquired through such a 
program. 

HOUSING 
Presently, with the exception of the Mesa 
Apartments, on-campus housing is 
determined by college affiliation. Are you 
in favor of opening all housing to all 
students regardless of affiliation with a 
particular college? 

- Pro

Revelle , one from Muir and onc from 
Warren - who all wanted to live 
together. In the present system, they'd 
have no choice but to live off-campus. 
This [referenduml would let them do 
that." 

-Con 
Some people believe that random 

hOUSing selection is a violation of the 
UCSD philosophy of "four separate 
colleges in one." 

Says Jonathan Lull, Revelle sophomore , 
"We're going to lose the small college 
atmosphere we're supposed to have." 

ELECTIONS COMMISSIONER 
Do you wish the Elections Commissioner 
to be a Council appointed ex-officio 
member of the AS Council effective as of 
the 1984-85 elections? (Article I, Section 
C. Part 2, Subscript e. of the ASUCSD 
Constitution) 
- Pro 

Randy Woodard . student government 
adVisor, says this referendum will remove 
what he calls :I "thankless job." 

Because the Elections Commissioner's 
job is to oversee elections, says 
Woodard , "One time. for one month of 

. the year, he's got something to do. 
"As it is, a person can'( he Elecllons 

Commissioner and hold another office. 
It's an obvious connict of interest to be 
running for office and running an 
election. 
-Can 

According to Woodard , "The only 
pOSSible detriment of the referendum I 
can see would be having one less vote on 
the AS Council."

Editorial 

The alternative views 
on alterna tive media 

The Associated Students' Alternative Print Media 
(new indicator, La VOz Fronteriza, People's Voice, 
Sappho Speaks, Koala, L'Chayim and Birdcage Review) 
received $40,000 in funding this past year. 

Do you wish to limit the maximum amount of 
funding received this year by the Associated Students' 
Alternative Print Media to $20,000? 
YES, limit funding to $20,000 
NO, do not place a limit on funding 

CON 
Regardless of how you feel about the present budget 

allocations of the AS toward the alternative media on 
campus, the ramification for the whole political 
process are being undermined by the manner in 
which this imponant issue has been handled by our 
tudent leade rs. 

The responsibilities of democratically elected 
representatives in our society are clear: They must 
invest their time to research penin nt issues in order 
to make decisions that benefit their constituencies. In 
some cases, when an issue has enough importance 
and scope. the representatives deem that the decision 
should be made by the people themselves. The 
alternative media fundi ng is such an issue . 

But the responsibilities of the elected officials do 
not Stop with the passing of the buck to the people. 
Rather, their role takes on an educational form. The 
representatives have an obligation to inform the 
people about the issue. Debates must be staged , 
opinions must be published and forums for open 
discussion must be held . 

In the case of the alternative media budget issue, 
many questions must be answered by the Associated 
Students Council itself: Why, at the beginning of the 
fiscal year, did it vote the alternative media a budget 
of well over $40,000? Surely as a council it felr that the 
minority views and politically dissenting opinions, 
rarely exhibited in the "home of the free ," are worthy 
of such monetary allocations, or it would not have 
voted as it did. What has happened in the last nine 
months to so drastically change the council's collective 
sentiments? Or was the referendum railroaded 
through as an item of immediate consideration by 
Communications Commissioner Tim Pickwell , who 
personally decided that cutting the budget in half was 
"fair ." And where is that newly found money going to 
be rerouted7 Possibly to the salary stipends thar the AS 
is currently seeking for itself? 

These questions must be answered , and a hard look 
needs to be taken at the effect upon the altcrnative 
media publications, in the light of the drastic $20,000 
budget Cut proposed. Until thcse question and issues 
are addressed, the students of this University are 
having their rights in the democratic process 
compromised by the mere existence of the alternative 
media budget cut referendum on the ballot. 

-SF 

PRO 
Seven publications, "alternative media," at UCSD 

had distributed among them last year $40,000 from 
the Associated Students, or nearly $6,000 each , An 
alternative medium, for those who do nor recogni ze 
the phrase, is a newspaper or magazine whose 
readership is either too small or too uninreresced to 
suppOrt it , or in most cases both. 

What is it an alternative to? Sometimes to the 
creation of an effective and truly useful organization . 
When a group expresses itself through a newspaper. 
often it consists of a diminutive , hard-core collec tion 

of people who like to imagine a large constituency 
which, since they never see it, they cannot tell exists. 
It is a silent constituency, merely existing in 
conjecture, and conjecture will always expand and 
multiply any of its subjects. If you swung a cat, you 
might knock down every serious reader of an 
alternative medium, It is nor beyond the range of 
belief that those who write one exceed in number 
those who read it. Or the two groups might be one in 
the same. Where the alternative medium serves not as 
the vortex point of a large organization but as the 
whole of a small one, it is merely a club with a very 
expensive hobby - expensive to us. 

So it can be the alternative to admitting that there 
are simply not very many people interested in one's 
issue. The alternative to having to finally admit this 
because of an infinitesimal but costly circulation is to 
distribute off campus, Here , in the wide-open spaces 
where many people own pet birds, the AS-bought 
newsprint can quickly be swallowed up. Where the 
distributors expect people to read it, they certainly do 
not seem to expect people to pick it up if they have to 
pay for it which is why the students of UCSD must be 
prevailed upon in this charitable, educational effon. 
Charity begins at home, but it does not end there. 

If a readership does, in fact , exist, AS funding is an 
alternative to having to pay any attention to it. 
Financial security gives literary security. A guaranteed 
income allows one to ignore subscribers, advertisers 
and donors. The popularity of a subject and the 
quality of the thought and writing on it become 
unimporant, and the need$ and desires of the 
publishers are the only things that demand attention . 

A $6,000 budget is an alternative to anyone noticing 
a vacuity of content. Glossiness, if less useful , is often 
more noticeable than quality. Several thousand dollars 
can cover a multitude of sins. On the same line, 
quality of thought and expression and genuine 
interest in a readership will cover a great deal of 
honest poverty. Several alternative media should 
spend less time worrying about their budgets and 
more about their content. 

And what is the alternative to alternative media? 
Perhaps there is none , for on a campus there are 
many views which should be discussed , and there will 
never be enough people who want to pay cash for the 
discussion. On the other hand , the UCSD alternative 
media's budget is large by any campus' standard, as 
are its abuses. A limit on their budget of $20,000 -
and otherwise we should perhaps see it grow over 
$40,000 - would force the media to put some real 
thought into how well they are spending their money. 
In short , they would have to be careful with their 
money - with our money, for until now they have 
show? themselves to be extremely careless of our 
money. The California Review, in reduced 
circumstances after being denied alternative media 
fu nding, has nor reduced its quality, has in fact 
increased it, and is as good as or better than any of 
our AS-financed alternative media. 

There may be ways "less drastic" or "more fair" in 
going about increasing the responsibility of the 
alternative media and decreasing the bite out of the 
student body, but they will in the end have no 
effectiveness. Unless the student body makes a 
definite decision in the referendum, the budget will be 
caught up again in the winding crawl of the AS's 
ineffectiveness. The result will be a long se ri es of 
decisions - or indecisions - by the AS, a growing 
alternative media budget and a multipli cation of the 
si ns the excessive budget already causes.

There is currently on our

knowledgeable. hardworking and

We are the AS Express. One of 
our primary goals this nexr year. 
if e1ecred. is 10 communicare

pur us into ornce. Information

We would like to improve the

Editor: 

Erik L. Roede 
'83-'S" Commissioner 

of Activity Fees 

As you are aware . cilmpus 
elecrions will be coming this 
Wednesday and Thursday. It is 
the concern of the Muir College 
Council rhat many students are 
not aware thar in addition to 
selecting rhe college and AS 
candidares of rheir chOIce. rhey 
will also be responding 10 a 
number of resolurion questions 
proposed by rhe AS Counci l. The 
members of MCC would like to 
express our concern for one of 
these resolurions . particularly that 
whi h involves possible changes 

tudents from every college would 
be housed together on any of rhe 
four campuses. It is our reeling 
lhal rhi s rype of ac rion would 
only serve 10 undermine rhe four-
college system as it exisrs ar 
UCSD IOday. 

In addirion ir seems 
inappropriare 10 present this 
issue ro rhe srudenr body ar large, 
in light of rhe facr rhar it 
concerns only a portion of rhe 
student popularion. An issue such 
as rhis should be decided by 
those who would be directly 
affecred by it - namely 
residents. More importantly, we 
must also bear in mind rhar over 
50% of on-campus housi ng is 
occupied by freshmen; rherefore 
it would be unreasonable ro 
assume rhar the inreresrs of rhe 
majoriry of nexr year's residents 
could be represented by rhe 
current voting popularion. 

Finally, in analyzing rhe 
possible ourcomes of such a 
proposal . we foresee a real 
problem in rhe disrriburion of 
srudents rhroughour rhe existing 
hOUSing srructures. If the currenr 
residenrs have first choice of 
housing locations (as they do 
under the currenr system), ir 
seems only likely thar rhe 
incoming freshmen wirh lasr 
choice will be designated ro rhe 
leasr desirable on-campus 
locarions. resulring in rhe 
formulation of an all -freshman 
campus. 

Again , we should remind 
srudents rhar rhis proposal is only 
a "poll" of srudent opinion, and 
that rhis resolution will nor 
necessarily lead 10 acrual changes 
in the srrucrure of rhe currenr on-
campus housing system: however, 
we feel rhar students should 
nonerheless be aware or the 
consequences which could result 
rrom the support of such an 
issue .

The Duelist 

Computer referendum 
for a new literacy 
By CHRISTOPHER CANOLE 

Standing with wrinkled hands 
submerged elbow-deep in the grey-
brown murky suds , washing the 
millionth dish for the day, the Class of 
'74 graduate stared at the grease-stained 
wall, pondering the most common 
question UCSD students think about in 
the yea rs after graduation: Why were 
there no general education courses 
required that could be used for survival 
in the real world? 

A challenging answer to this question 
is being presented as a referendum on 
the AS election ballot. 

Many students do not confront this 
question while attending our university, 
because they have little or no Idea what 
awalls Ihem after graduation. And since 
there IS such a diversity of diSCiplines we 
are trained for, it is most Improbable that 
the University would require practical 
courses in every discipline, because the 
profeSSIOnal fields themselves are 
constantl)' In a state of change But there 
IS one area of practical knowledge that 
permeates every a pect of our Ii ves today' 
COMPUTERS. 

While we ha[[le wllh rhe dav-ro-da\' 
survival In the real world outside. we ' 
depend upon practical knowledge and 
ahilit)' to use computers Hl)\\' can a 
unlvcrSlty claim to prepare sludcnts In 

;my career without requiring computer 
literacy? This is not just an idle challenge 
to he argued for years to come. It has 
hecome a referendum that needs to be 
voted in favor of now. so that we will not 
graduate and lament later. 

When TmlC magazine awarded its 
"Man of the Year" issue 10 the co mputer 
as the most Innuenti,11 helng In the world

Profile: 
The Presidential Candidates 
By PHIL WILLON &: STEVEN R, FRIEDMAN 

Jay Richards 

George Voloshin 
Revelle College, Electrical Eng. Major, 21 years old 

George Voloshll1 was the last candidate for AS 
PreSident to file for office, acquiring the necessary 
signatures JUSt hours before the noon deadline. Because 
of this , his quest for office has heen somewhat hehind 
the others'. Volosh.n commented , "My ca mpaign starred 
out late. hut I'll fin ish strong." 

About the other ca ndidates, Voloshin is somewhat 
cmical' "They ay 'If I'm elected , I'll do thiS.' I think 
people are tired of hearing thm. I'll do what's right for 
the students and what's wi thin my power." 

Breau e he is running as an independent , without a 
slate or [les to any student organizat ion, Voloshin feels 
that students can depend on him to do an honest and 
dependahle job. 

He also warns student about voting for slates: "When 
it comes to making dec isions and a person is pushing 
for something, even though it is somewhat of a wrong 
idea, his rriends I in the slate I on the AS will sort of back 
him ." Because he is not affiliated with anythi ng like 
thiS, he sal'S that he will do what he thinks is right and 
will nor he intimidated hyanyhody 

"l'm not promising ,111 sorts of thll1g5 ," a sured 
Voloshin . but added that whar he does will hem'fit mOTe 
people than Jusr a selecr group 01 Individuals. 

He feels thar the present hOUSing sysrem IS adequate 
enough to meet the students' needs and shouldn 't he 
changed just because 30 people would like to live on 
anmher campus. The majority of the slUdents living on 
campus are eirher freshmen or new transfer students, 
and Voloshin can't see how they would know where to 
li ve ,

Voloshin also feel s thar it is imponant that any 
organization receiving AS fu nding have certam 
obligations to rhe students: "If the students want to JOin, 
they should be able to find out quickly and easily where 
and how to join , and what are their responsibilities." He 
added that because money is such an important topic 
in every student's life, the programs available to aid in it 
hould be made more public .

£lie Il11pllrram? Upon 100kll1g at horh Sides of the 
alternative media issue I think a CUt 1V0uid be 
appropriate. I don't know if cutting it in half is 
appropriate, and I don 't know If the cuts should be as 
qUick ilnd sharp as the one proposed m the 
referendum. What I do think is that there should be a 
push towards more independence in all the media on 
campus .... I think the council should do everything it 
an to support and encourage a move like that. and I 

thll1k a cut like that would help that along. But I don't 
think they should be cut and left in the cold. I think the 
council should offer alternative means that are not 
direct funding hut would help the media on campus 

We need the media We need places where the 
people can get their voice: whether it's different than 
the majority thinks or nOl, thcy have the right to have a 
publication. 

What is your biggest or mO$t important campaIgn Issue~ 
What we would li ke to do is to mobilize the opmion 
and the actions of more students on campus and feed 
them information of rhmgs that happen on ca mpus. 
What we see is an untapped resource to do this. That's 
basically using the student organizations, of which there 
are about 160 which comprise about 1.700 students, 
and the intercollegiate and club sports which represent 
about another 700 students. What we would like to do 
is form two boards. One board that is comprised of a 
representative from each of the student organizations, 
and one board that is comprised of a representative 
from the intercollegiate clubs and spons. These boards 
would both have a liaison on the council , rhereby, the 
feelings and the Issues and policies that those boards 
feel stro ngly about will be brought to the AS's atten tion. 
And the issues thar the AS is dealing with will be 
brought to their Jttention 

What do you Jecl in Y(111r ramplllW1 ha~ made you a /Jetter

new. The way things really get done In any type 01 
bureauc racy is when you have a lot of people rallying 
behmu ,\0 issue. And with this type of a network of 
information , I think that we can get a lot more support 
on the issues that are dealt With on the council. And the

Third College, Lit/Writing Major, 20 years old 

ja)' Richards feds he IS the ,llternative to the empt)' 
campaign promise~ , the hlgh-n)'lng hanners, the 
hu[[ons and the multi-colored n),ers. He wants students 
to look heyond the f.mfarc and 10 vote for something 
hesldes just a name. 

"I want students to see me as hryond all the politkal 
hureaucracy." ~a)'s Richard . '" don 't want to be JU t a 
face : I want to he someone who represents student life 
as a whole." 

Student life is what Richards sees as the most 
important factor here at UC D. and what he is best 
qualified to guide and improve over the next year. 
Because he has heen an RA ,I[ Third College for the past 
two years and has heen feven shly involved with the 
intramuml program. Richards says he knows student 
needs and concerns a lot better than someone who has 
heen collecting dust in the AS for the past three years. 

"People don't need all the stuff the AS has dealt with. 
They need a tudem Center. they need housing on 
campus, they need parking. They need to be involved 
With the outs tde commu nity - a whole variery of things 
the /15 has never stood for." 

Richards expressed an arr of agreement ahout letting 
students live on campus wherever they wish. but 
srressed rhat the college sys tem must still be maintained. 
"We need [he college system ," Richards declared, "and 
we need college hOUSing to create a sense of community 
within the school." This is something he feels would be 
lost in a mass of 12,000 people.

What are your qualifications? I've had a lot of 
experience with organizations. I work at the Women's 
Resource Center. I arrange coffee hours and lecture 
discussions. I served in student council in high school. 
I'm also involved in political activi[les here whtch give 
me experience organizlIlg and speaking to people. and 
I think I'm good at that. , also know a lot of different 
people on campus. And while I'm not directly IIlvolved 
in AS. I think all the other activities. including CARD, 
jesse Jackson. the Women's Celller .... give me an edge 
as far as organization goes. 

What arc your posillOns on the referclldums thOl Yllilfal 
arc importallt? I am definitely agai nst the media 
refe rendum. There seems to be a lack of dialog hetween 
the AS and the people from rhe alternative media. And 
the cuts seem to be arbllrary in thm the money which 
they want to cut from the alternative media is not being 
slated towards any particular activities or goals, , think

speCial drnners and parties as well as more athletic 
commi sions 10 help the reams 

As a result of all these measure , Tollner feels the

be to Ihem.

On the referendum to CUt the budget of the

reduction In funds was necessary but also felt that the 
nght for the papers to puhhsh should not be saenfleed 
for monetary reasons. 

Also on the ballot t a referendum to open all campus 
housing to all students regardless of affiliation wuh a 
particular college. "I feel that if a Third College sllldent 
wants to hl'e In Revelle he should have a chance," said 
Tollner, who IS doing exactly that. He added thar u may 
bring UC D sllldents closer together, something that is 
lacking at the moment.

Campus Forum 

Should there be prayer in public school? 
By MARGARET. MILLER 
KRISTA KIGER 

Krista KIger or Warren College WIll be 
studying for the minlst!')' after 
graduation. but she believes that pra)'er 
In school IS nO! the solution to the 
religion/ cd uca[lon Issue because the 
problem is deeper than 11 appears. "The 
prohlem presented by the pro-pra)'er 
group IS that there is nm enough religion 
in schools, but the real problem is that 
teachers are afraid to introduce religion, 
especially a diversity of religions to the 
students ." Kiger sal's 

In elementary school. children hal'e 
not yet formed their rehglous behefs 
"Any kind of helle!' become a pan of ),ou 
as ),OU grow," says Kiger Attaining 
religious Identit), is a growth pro ess, 
and imposed prayer forces the children 
intll that process at a pace not congruent 
with their own development," she said. 
Thus, prayer in school may be for some 
students a matter or "going through the 
motions'" ritual without substance. 

In addition, says Kiger, "Even though 
u's not Impllcity stated , we're talkll1g 
ahout Chris[lan prayer; thiS is an 
amendment sponsored by Chrisllan 
denomll1ations. We're leaving out Jewish 
children, we're leaving LJUt Muslim 
c hildren , and this is a prohlem, 
especially in Calirornia. We're such u 
melting POt of cultures and Jifferent 
religiOUS beliefs. Prayer in school, I think, 
discriminates. 

"Even though it's fabulous that 
c hildren are developing their own 
religious faiths , they need to realize that 
there are other faiths that their fellow 
students have," she added. 

As an alternative lU led school prayer, 
Kiger recommends a "gentle sharing" of 
haekgrounds and beliefs. "I think what IS 
wrong in the schools roda)' is mat 
religiOUS subjects have become taboo. It 
would he a pOSl[lve thing to nor be so 

~c,m.'d to talk ahout God. and to 
Intmducc different kind. of religIOn to 
chddren ," she SJld . 

"All religions have the ~ame core. God 
gave us free will to think and to feel. and 
,1150 to deCide how we want to rollow 
Him." 

APltIl. JO 

ELAINE WALLACE 
What about the minute of si lence] 

1 his is a compromise hetween led pra)'e r 
and no prayer. Elame Wallace, also of 
Warren , is surprised that pra),er In 
school could he such a major issue. 
Maybe , she says, the proposed minute of 
sdence could cool down both sides of 
the controver y. 

"I would not be opposed to a 
deSignated minute of silence for 
whatever purposes; a minute to yourself 
whatever [ltie the)' want to give 11 .... I[ 
would serve the interests or many people. 
Children would have that time to pray. 
meditate or think ahour their 
homework." Wallace said. 

Th is does not have the same stigma of 
"directed thoughts" or controlled spiritual 
experien e which the anti-prayer groups 
object to . On the other hand . this minute 
should be more issue-oriented than the 
minute of silence which a group or kids 
maintains after the teacher tells them to 
be quiet, Wallace said, She sugge ts that 
the teacher ritualize the minute by 
scheduling it after the pledge of 
allegiance and having it introduced hy a 
unit on cultural or constitutional 
traditions in the U . This way. she says, 
students would get an idea of the context 
of their minute. 

Reflective thinking, Wallace argues , 
need not be 'Iimited to the home or 
church. "For small children especially, 
school is really important; ... the s hool 
serves as a bridge between fam i1y and 
"society"; school is what socializes you to 
be in the world - you can't learn it all 
from your family ." 

The practi e of reflective thinking, 
which is a common aspect of nil religious 
medltaliOn (led or individual '. is <I 
valuahle resource 10 being III the lI'orld , 
Wallace s'lId . The mlnUtl' of sdenCl: 
lI'ould givc st udents c,1('I) l'Xpo~urc [0 
thiS resource. "A thought-filled minute, 
nm lust , I snDoze, would he helplul.

think," Wallace said "Your day I ~ ~nn of 
aimlessly spent unless you have an Ide,1 
of where )'ou're at .. It would be gnod il

Sockers on top, 
after rough season 
By ANDREW KEELER 

The an Diego Sockers again proved 
Ihey are Ihe best team In mdoor soc cr. 
bar none. Wednesday mght they 
completed a championship sweep of the 

ew York Cosmos to clinch their third ' 
straight title 

The 1983-84 NASL campaign might 
have been San Diego' best - hut it was 
not the easiest. The roller coasler ride 
ended 111 New York but the problems 
and controversy that have followed the 
ockers did not. 

As the Sockers came from two goals 
behind for an impressive 7-3 victOry, 
head coach Ron Newman had to watch 
the game on television in San Diego. He 
had nown home Tue~day to be with his 
daughter who was in the hospital. 

Al 0 during the playoffs. the NASL 
owners threatened to fold the league if 
an agreement cannot be reached WIth 
the player's association by April 19. If 
this happens. it would mean cancellation 
of the outdoor season and probably a 
move back to the MISL for the Sockers 
next sea on , 

InjUries. infightmg. controversies and 
some good soccer made for a fun and 
Interesting seasqn. As they always do, the 
Sockers started slowly. They lost their 
opening game. but rebounded for three 
wins. Championship form? Wrong. A 
few games later, they hit a skid during 
which they lost five of seven. including a 
home match against Tulsa. their first 
home defeat in two years. 

The grumbling grew louder The 
pla)'ers were unhappy wnh the coach . 
the coach was unhappy w1th the players. 
"The end of the dynasty" wa frequently 
beard . And then Alan Mayer broke his 
finger. Mayer. last year's MISL pla)'er of 
the year and all-star goalie . was out 
indefinitely. 

Enter Jim Gorsek. The 28-year-old 
untested backup was called in . Not 
comcldentally. the Sockers turned things 
around and collected victories m mne of 
the next ten games. Things were 
harmoniol's again. The squad was 
playing like a world beater. Three times 
the Arena was packed to capacity. Such 
was the case when the Sockers clinched 
first place with a victory on the last night 
of the regular eason. 

JUSt as all great teams do. the ocker 
are at their best III post-season play. 
They have a 19-2 record in playoff 
competition and are 13-0 all-time at 
home. They made easy work of the 
Golden Bay Earthquakes with 7-2 and 5-
2 victories. The championship series 
became a showcase for the Sockers.Jim 
Gorsek was brilliant. just as he had been 
all season. Young stars Brian QUinn. 
Hugo Perez and SDSU graduate Kevin 
Crow played like seasoned veterans. The 
veterans who have led the team to the 
three consecutive titles were also firing 
on all cylinders. Captain Kaz Deyna. 
scoring machine Julie Veee. Martin 
Donnelly. Ade Coker and pia)'off MVP 

Lorcnz Hllkes ,julie Vec and Guy Newmon cc/ebrale rhe Sockers' rhird slrQlghr Indoor ririe. 
Jean WIlIrich put on a clinic 

The ockers took advantage of every 
Cosmos error and created havoc for 
goahes DaVId Brcic and Huberr 
Birkenmeier as they breezed by ew 
York 5-2. 10-4 and 7-3. According to 
Brcic. "They are a much more 
diSCiplined team and they make few 
mistakes." 

Cosmos coach Eddie Firmant said . 
"They Ithe ockersl enJoy the indoor 
game more than the outdoor. and Ihat's a 
big difference." 

Coker agreed that the team likes the 
mdoor game. but also said . "We take It 

more seriousl)' and we work at It." 
The ockers took it seriously enough. 

The fans took II seriously also as they 
turned out to greet the returnlllg heroes 
al the SportS Arena. Mayor Roger 
Hedgecock was on hand WIth owner Bob 
Bell Newman called this year's team 
"very special" and the championship "a 
miracle: ' considering the adversities the 
Sackers faced. 

The new question in the Sockers' soap 
opera will be. "Who do we beat now1" 
Willnch Said . "We are the champions, 
and if the MISL doesn't believe it , we can 
go back next year and do II again ." Stay 
tuned . 

Hockey Southern California style 
By JOE DESIDERIO 

This past weekend. more than 150 
hockey players congregated at the UCSD 
Rec Gym. The occasion: the Third 
Annual California Floor Hockey 
Invi tational Tournament. 

The tOurnament, traditionally held at 
UCSD in early April , was well-attended. 
with sc hools showing up from as far as 
Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo. In 
all. rhere were ten teams competing. 
including UCSD's representative . 
intramural MA champ. The Second 
Coming of Captain Dick and His 
Seamen. 

UC D played on Friday in the "San 
Diego" bracket. consisting of UCSD. an 
Diego tate and University of an Diego. 
These three teams began play on Friday 
afternoon to reserve the nIght games for 
Ihe teams that had to make the trip to 
San Diego. 

The first contest was a remar h of a 
warm-up game bst weekend , in which 
D U oUlplayed UCSD 5-3. 1 his time . 

the Aztecs had a lOugher lime. as UCSD 
pla)'ed them to a 2-2 tiC in a game that 
rould have gone to either team 

After a ten-mlllute hre.lk. U . D faced

the winner would wind up in fir t place. 
the loser m third . 

D U got off to a quick start and 
peppered the USD goa lie for a 4-1 lead . 
However. the USD players showed that 
they were not to be counted out. s oring 
three unanswered goals to end the game 
in a 4-4 tie. 

With all three teams tied in the 
standmgs at 0-0-2 . the rankings were 
settled in the time-honored manner: the 
tournament organizer. cort Berndes . 
drew the team names from a hat. The 
final standings for the first round: SDSU . 
UC D and USD. respectively. 

While the "Bartle of an Diego" was 
going on. the rest of the teams began to 
arrive. Besidc~ the "San Diego" hracket. 
there were twO others. The second 
hracket consisted of Claremont McKenna 
College . CSU San Bernardino :lI1d US 
The thll'c\ hracket contained fnur teams

With the score 1-1 at the end of 

regularon time . the game went into 
overtime. At firsl , it seemed 'mange to 
institute overtime afler so many game 
had ended tied . but there was an 
important faclOr that made this game 
different. ince there were fOllr teams in 
the third bracket , there had to be 
definite first. second and third place 
finishers . because the fourth place team 
would have to play <In extra game in 
Saturday's playoffs. Rather than playing 
an overtime period. the teams were 
nOllfied thai the game would end 111 a 
shoot-out. with Ihe player III the game 
when it ended p<lrtlclpanng 111 the 

~hoot-out. Add II1g 10 the pleasure of an

SD U and USC made it no further than 
the next round. the quarterfinals. 

In the semifinals, there were rwo 
match-ups: Fresno Pacific-UC5D and 
UC B-Northndge. 

The first semifinal game pitted two of 
the scrappier teams. Fresno PacifIC and 
UCSD. against each other Both of these 
teams followed a "dump and chase" 
game plan . in contrast to the more 
controlled . finesse strateg)' of the 
seasoned UCSB team. 

Fresno struck first . hanging on to a 
ollc-goallead for the first period UCSD 
slruck back in the second period . only to 
have Fresno jump ahead 2·1 later in the 
period. UC D tied it up again in the. 
thIrd period. but Fre no put the pressure 
on. s nring on a power play. Fresno 
added another power play goal ncar the 
end of the game, putting the game out of 
the rea h of UCSD. Penalties were the 
downbll of UC D, and Fresno advanced 
In the final round with a comfortable 4-2

Flip-flop season's 
frustrating finale 
By LISA LAPIN 

Off a hll by Pat Brienen . the volleyball 
rebounded - the laSt POInt of the last 
game of the last match for the UCSD 
Tritons - landing right in the ball 
bucket. comtllg to rest there until January 
of 1985 when a new men's team. under a 
new coach. will lake the court 

The final ball played was typi cal of the 
Triton sea on. a season of hard knocks 
and very few lifts It was a season of solid 
losses against the top-ranked teams in 
the country. includmg the final match 
last Saturday night. before the largesl 
home crowd ever. against second-ranked 
Pepperdine. 

The match was coach Douf Danne\'lk's la t \\'Ith the men s tcam. 
possibl)' his laSt ilt UCSD if offers from 
the University of Hawaii as an assistant 
coach come through Dannevik had hull' 
[0 say at the end of thr match . which 
UCSD lost at 15-4. 15-3. 15-6 

Pepperdine. under top volleyball coach 
Marv Dunphy. did not get enough of a 
workout from the Tritons. holding an 
unheard of hour of rigorous practice in 
the gym after the match. The Waves were 
the beSt all-around team that UCSD 
faced all season. with well-trained . strong 
athletes. recruiting power and money -
assets that the Tritons can never hope to 
allain. Pepperdine has an All-American 
and the top. 1983 recruit. as well as 
several players on large scholarships. On 
the court. their moves were well-
executed. and their blocking wall was all 
hut impossible to break through. 

Yet. the Tritons had their moments . 
with fine performances and every player 
getti ng coun time The fans still enjoyed 

the match .• IS Spirit and elllhuslasm was 
high hath on and off the coun The 
Triton players sti ck together and arc wry 
supportive of each other. They went out 
"10 have fun ": It \\'as their playmg motto 
all year long. ,lnd it kept them going. 

Mark Arnold . a 6-5 middle hlocker out 
of Costa Mesa. was a fierce hitter. with 
many kill for Wave POintS. John 
"Hendo" Henderson had a hit for a side-
OUt that Pepperdine quickly recovered . 
Then a dive by Brienen on the backcourt 
proved worthless. and the Waves surged 
ahead to a 5-1 lead . 

Dannevik called a time out which was 
not effective for an)' Triton points. ye l a 
long rally. perhaps the high point of the 
match . saw excellent teamwork hy the 
home team. and a block hy Tnton star 
Mall Hunt ended it with a Side-out for 
UCSD. 

Criswell managed another side-out. 
with steady hackup from both sellers. 
Eric Hallman and Greg Howarth. UCSD 
had no trouble hitting. but was simply 
unable to block the Waves. Pepperdine 
had offense and defense well c,overed, 
with Impassable blocking roofs well 
above the ner. 

With the score 13-1 . the Tri to ns 
showed the crowd some of their best 
play all season. and added three more 
points to their total. Matt Hunt had a hit 
for a side-out. and Briene n had a slam 
down the line that scored one. Criswell 
and Hallman had the crowd cheering by 
leaping to three consecutive blocks. the 
final one for a point. Yet. typical of the 
Waves. they spoiled the glory and came 
back to win at 15-4

The second game went faster rhan the 
first , with Pepperdine still on the attack. 
Several missed hits by the home team. as 
well as the Waves' Robert McNutt, who 
appeared to be all over the coun. put 
Pepperdine ahead by four. Henderson 
finally nabbed a point to make it 5-1. but 
a net call ended the streak. McNutt gO! 
off the ground for his blocks. but Tad 
Braun and Criswell with back-up by 
Doug Stanley. were able to sneak by hits 
for side-outs that did not amount to 
points. 

Friedman had another of his many 
hits on the nigpt. and UCSD errors aided 
his pursuit. Setter Kevin Bateman 

managed a rare hit for a side out. but 
Pepperdine's Fitzgerald was there to take 
the ball back. The final result: two more 
Triton points. scored on nets by the 
Waves. and 15 well-earned points for the 
visitors. 

The third game was a definite crowd-
pleaser, well-fought by the Tritons. who 
scored lhe most points in the three 
games in this match., 

Knights scored the last point for rhe 
Tritons. and the Waves' Ty Kastendiek 
had an arm swing that helped them win. 
The final Pepperdine point came from 
the out-of-bounds ball aimed right into 

~he bucket. ending it all at 15-6.

UC5D still earns plnYJ)! berth 
Split ends baseball title hopes 
By JEFF SAVAGE 

The UCSD haskethall team arrived in 
Costa Mesa Saturda)' morning with all 
hopes for a District III Southern Division 
fi rst place finish on the line and left that 
evening with those ame hopes pretty 
much eliminated. By managing just a 
split of a doubleheader with Southern 
Division leader Southern Cal College. 
UCSD will most likely have to se ttle for 
second place in the Division race. CC 
owns a comfortable three-and-one-half 
game lead over the Tritons with JUSt four 
games to play. Mathematicall y. the 
Tritons remain ali ve. Real isticall y. they 
do not. 

"There was no doubt that we needed 
to sweep if we were to still have a 
chance." said Triton coach Lyle Yate 
"We badly needed the swee p. but all we 
got was a split." 

At least SCC didn 't leave matters in 
douht for very long. They Jumped all over 
UCSD pitcher Eric Reynolds for five runs 
in the first two innings of the first game 
to settle the affair early. Although Frank 
Califano ca me on to shut out the 
Vanguards the rest of the way. the 
T rirons lost 5-2. Re)'nolds has been 
plagued hy hack prohlems since the un 
Lite Classic a month ago when he 
suffered a back spasm in a game against 
Sa n Diego Srate "Eric is a little afraid 10 
let the hall go." says Yates. "Ile usually 
sets up his other pitches off hiS fastball. 
but he dnesn't haw much veloclI), now " 
Nonctheless. Ihe Triton coaching staff 
decided that Reynolds desen'ed the start 
after resting a week. It was a decision 
UCSD won't soon forg!'t. 

Whilc Ca hfano was hus), dOing a 
marvelous joh on the mound . yield i ng 
just twO hits without a walk for the 
remainder of the game . UCSD scored 
once in the second and once more in 
tbe sevel1th before surrendering. Joe 
Wolfs infield si ngle which scored Derek 
Alkonis from third . got the Tritons a run 
clbser In the second and then In thc 
seventh . Wolf. with no one on base to 
drive in this timt'. produced a run 
nonetheless with hiS third homerun of 
rhe ycar. a drive over the left field fence 

With the first game sc th,lck. It would

have heen e,lS), for UCSD III roll llver and 
la)' C;IS)' pre)' fnr Ihe Vanguards in the 
nightc<lp . hut this team has char.lcter. 
The Tritons gal'c Ihemselves something 
rn talk ahnut on Ihe hus ride home as 
the)' exploded fM six runs In the fourth 
inning and pounded out an 8-3 
deci ion . 

The Tritons picked up a pair of runs 
in the first as David ra nov ich singled 
and scnred two Outs later on a double by 
Derek Alkoni s. who then crossed rhc 
plate himself on a double by John 
Rosness. SCC qUickly came h<lck with 
two runs in the second to tie II . hut hy 
then the Tritons had had enough. With 
one out in the fourth . Rosness and Jim 
Martin managed hack-to-back Singles. 
Rosness then scored on a wild pilch 
before Dan DiMascio reached second 
base on an error. Yates followed the 
hi under with a suicide squeeze and 
Klaudio Biazevlch laid it down perfectly 
to ~core Martin . The obviously rattled 
Vanguard pitcher followed with a 
co ntrihution of hiS o\\'n as he halked in 
DIMaSCIO from third . After Bi.uevlch 
stole second hase. Stanovich grounded 
one to the right Side where Ihe second 
baseman played soccer With II . allOWing 
Blazevich to score the fOllrth run of the 
inning <lnd give UC -0 a 6-2 advantage. 
Third baseman Don Petersen. generally a 
Ime drive hitter. promptl)' closed out the 
inning In high 5t),le with a two-run shot 
ovcr the left field wall. 

So the Tritons came to CC and didn 't 
get what they wanted. but at least they 
showed the first place Vanguards that 
rhey could play in the sa me hall park wit h 
them. In fact . Yates and the rest of the 
crew fcelthat SCC is nothing spec ial at 
all. "We definitely want anOther shot at 
them." said Yates_ "We hope to see them 
again in the tourname nt." 

The tournament Yates is referring to is 
the NAlA District III mini-tournament 
which is round one of the District III 
playoffs. And although UCSD is Vi rtually 
out of title contention. the last four 
league games on their sc hedule remain 
quite critical.

With ten teams eligihle for the District 
III playoffs and seve n qualifying. the 
Tritons arc <l lread)' assured of a playoff 
spOt this season. The win ners of both the 
southern <lnd northern conferences of 
the District earn a fi rsr round bye as does 
thc team with the next hest record in the 
District. The remaining four teams square 
off in a single ehmination mini -
rournament ro he held at UCSD thi s year. 
If the season were to end today. the 
Tritons would finish second In the 
southern conference while owning the 
hest record of Ihe four remaining teams 
and therefore receive the number-one 
seed. This would allow them to play the 
seventh . or last-seeded ream in the min i-
rournament. The eventual winner of the 
mini-tournament earns a Spot in the 
main District III playoffs. half of whICh 
Will he held at UCSD this year. The mini-
tournament IS scheduled to hegi n May 5. 

Prior to the CC split. UCSD is 

coming off a 10-3 loss to national 
powerhouse San Diego State at Olsen 
Ficld. It was the first time ever that SDSU 
even hothered with the ti ny NAlA Tritons 
on Ihe rO:ld . Finally being acknowledged 
<IS :l competitive ballclub is a tremendous 
step for the UCSD haseball programs. 

The Tmons were actually in the game 
until the seventh inn ing when starter 
Steve Saggiani tired and the Aztecs broke 
open a 5-3 contest. A leadoff homer by 
PhtiJohnson and a free pass to Flavia 
Alfaro hrought in reliever Rob Haswell 
who shut the Aztecs down. But Kevin 
Illingworth couldn't find the groove and 
SDSU rocked and socked their way 10 a 
seven run difference . 

What IS most remarkable ahout th is 
game was that UCSD fielded seven 
freshmen In the starting lineup -
somethi ng Yates must be excused for 
droohng ovcr when looking at UCS D's 
hright future .
