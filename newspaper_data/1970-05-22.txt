Davis Raps On :U.S. 
Genocide, Malcolm X 

Students, F acu Ity 
Lobby at Capitol 

Manuel de Jesus Hernandez 
Contr ibuting Editor 

To defend Bobby Seale is to defend your own 
existence; your right to dissent, your right to 
rebel," exclaimed Angela Davis, controversial 
UCLA professor at a rally held Tuesday, May 19, to 
commemorate the birth of Malcolm X. In what 
seemed to be a last minute arrangement, BSC 
organized and coordinated the event held in the 
UCSD gym. 

Over 300 dollars were donated to the Augusta, 
Georgia Defense Fund. The proceeds are to be sent 
to those families aflicted in the Augusta, Georgia 
and the Jackson, Mississippi incidents and are to 
serve for legal defense and medical treatment. 

Although she arrived late to her speaking 
engagement, when introduced by Dr. Joe Watson 
around 9:30 she was received with a standing 
ovation. 

"Many whites in this country are remaining silent 
and saying 'Right On' to Fascism," she warned. By 
permitting Fascism to creep within the system, 
they are inviting repression and denying the right 
of revolutionary groups like the Black Panthers to 
dissent and rebel. This repression would not only 
affect Blacks but also whites, witness Kent State. 

The topic of her speech was repression and 
genocide. But before developing her topic she 
mentioned to the audience that Malcolm X's bir-
thday coincided with that of Ho Chi Minh, liberator 
of the Vietnamese people. 

She mentioned that if people in the "movement" 
were going to resist Fascism that they were going to 
have to learn from Malcolm X "in order to exist." 
Then she referred to a quote by Malcolm X, "once 
we commit ourselves to the struggle, we have to 
determine who are our friends; who are our 
enemies." In the sense that Ho Chi Minh was 
Malcolm X's friend, so should our friends be alike. 

On genocide Miss Davis admonished the urgent 
need to wage a struggle into the genocide that is 
occurring here in the United States, perpetrated by 
the government. She mentioned the "current 
program" for the extermination of the Black 
Panther Party as a form of genocide. 

The United States government has refused to afix 
it's signature, Angela told her audience, referring to 

UCLA Philosophy Professor Angell Divis Is seen here 
Iddresslngl rilly In the gym TuesdlY . 

the genocide treaty drafted by the United States 
after World War ll. She further exposed the United 
States government of being "guilty of every single 
act enumerated in that treaty." 

The enslavement of Blacks for 400 years was a 
form of genocide. The U.S. habit of "stealing the 
natural resources of Third World nations" was 
another form of genocide. And here at home 
"genocide is the fact that 'pig' forces have weapons 
that are outlawed internationally," referring to a 
gun used to quell Black liberation uprisings like in 
Watts and Harlem that can penetrate a ten foot 
cement wall. 

With the current protest over the Cambodian 
invasion by President Nixon, Miss Davis said that 
not only should we demand a unilateral withdrawal 
from Cambodia but also a " unilateral withdrawal of 
all troops from foreign lands and the Black and 
Chicano communities," in order to put an end to 
repression and genocide here at home and abroad. 

Angela ended her speech by voicing to the public 
her hope that " no one inside the gym would give an 
affirmative vote to fascism and repression at 
home." 

Other speakers at the rally were: Bob Pikes, who 
called Malcolm X a "great saint" when he recited 
a eulogy; Elma Carter, sister of Bunch Carter, a 
Black Panther Party member who was killed at 
UCLA, praised for establishing ties with Africa and 
Malcolm generating pride for Blackness ; Marcus 
Anderson, member of the House of Yureh, a Black 
organization, who made an anology of Malcolm X 
being the runner in a relay who passed the baton to 
revolutionaries like Huey P. Newton, Eldridge 
Cleaver, Bobby Seale and others.

A 0 Glass Onion

An 18-member delegation com-
prised of students, faculty, and 
non-academic staff representing 
UCSD went to Washington, D.C., 
last week to present its dissatis-
faction with the Nixon Adminis-
tration 's policy in Southeast Asia . 
The delegation , supported by a 
campus-wide fund-raising drive, 
chose lobbying as its method of 
expressing its view of the frustra-
tion of the community which 
supported it. The main body of 
the delegation left on Tuesday 
and Wednesday last week and 
returned over the weekend by 
plane. 

The delegates included people 
from all parts of UCSD: faculty 
members were Dr. Robert Ham-
burger, Prof. Michael Parrish, 
Prof. Jerome Skolnick, and Prof. 
Roy Harvey Pierce; graduate 
students were Ann Roman, 
Richard Marshall, and Garth 
Nicholson; non-academic per-
sonnel were Patricia White and 
Bernard Ashcraft; Revelle stu-
dents were Jay Gillette, Greg 
Hudson, and Mark Wozny; and 
Muir students were Mike Mor-
gan, Jack Morrison, Bill Bagby, 
Terry Barak, Phil Muilenburg, 
and Cyndi Mitton. 

Ann Roman went several days 
in advance to arrange appoint-
ments with legislators and to find 
an office to work in. Congress-
man Lionel Van Deerlin (D-San 
Diego) gave a large part of his 
office for students to use, includ-
ing telephones, typewriters, and 
secretarial help. 

The group attempted to direct 
its lobbying efforts toward those 
legislators who remained as yet 

With today being the last day you can vote, it is time to take a last 
look at who's running for AS president. Rather than consider issues Â· 
here, the attempt is to instead expose something of the personality of 
the candidates. It is hoped that, when voting, this might make an 
absurd task even more so. The candidates being looked at, with 
equally unfair treatment given each, are Mike Palcic, Jim Magill, 
Karl Keating, and Brian "Write-In" Ritter. 

The clndldltes for AS President this year are, from left to right, Jim Magill , 
Briln Ritter, Mike Pllcic, and Karl Keating . Voting ends today for primary 

Mike Palcic, dubbed "Heavy" during his freshman year because of 
his imposing stature, is currently AS vice-president. Two years ago he 
took charge of the Coffee Hut and his friendly, engaging nature 
quickly set the atmosphere for the place 

With wild "hootenannies" and stale, old "camp" movies, Heavy 
turned the Hut into a place where differential-eq~tion-twisted UCSD 
minds could go to actually feel worse. It was about the time that Heavy 
tried to sign Wayne Newton as a Coffee Hut regular that someone 
convinced him to run for veep. Who knows what made him decide to 
run fo.r President? ? 

Dressed like Arnold Palmer, Jim Magill (no relation to Wild Bill ) 
always looks like he's making the trip from the last grP.en to the bar 
- "not the worst place in the world," Jim confesses. Floating 
around in student government for years now, he has become an expert 
on such important issues as how to get the C<iffee Hut a beer license 
(no dice), where the latest party is, etc. A man of diverse outside in-
terests, Magill is particularly fond of his collection of abstract art. 
Featured in it is the longest chain of pop-top openers made by a person 
over 15 years old

Karl Keatiilg is the editing genius behind that celebrated journal of 
moderate opinion, DIMENSION. Now this does not mean that Keating 
would make a terrible president. After all, he asks, " What do you 
want - good grammar or good taste?" 

Unfortunately his grammar is good. He is conspicuously the only 
candidate with a girl for a running-mate . Disappointed that it couldn 't 
be Shirley Temple Black, he finally settled on Mary Pat Huxley (no 
relation to Aldous ). 

Brian Ritter became so embroiled in his campaign to institue a 
" free dorm" on campus that he forgot to hand in his petition. Not one 
to be daunted by conventions, however, Ritter proceeded with a 
"write-in " campaign . 

Born and raised in El Cajon, Ritter currently resides in Woodstock 
Nation. A self-styled Yippie, he is known for activities which mark a 
radical divergence from normal college life. Ritter 's drive for a "fre 
dorm" has won him support from such nCJtables as Abbie Hoffman , 
TRITON TIMES Arts Editor Jeff Freed (whoops-Fried ), Vassar 
College, and six students from Muir (College ). Called the "dark 
horse" candidate, Ritter claims he never touches the stuff.

lutions before the Senate seeking 
to cut off military funds being 
spent in Southeast Asia . These 
two bills are : the Cooper-Church 
Amendment to the Military 
Appropriations Bill, which will 
cut off all money to the military 
being spent in Cambodia or Laos 
after June 30, 1970; and the 
McGovern-Hatfield Amendment 
to the Military Appropriations 
Bill which will cut off all money 
to the military to be spent in 
Southeast Asia after June 30,

themselves, the delegation did

Student delegations were noth-
ing new on Capitol Hill that week. 
Ever since President Nixon's 
announcement of the Cambodian 
invasion, student delegations 
from all over the country ap-
peared there in droves . A fre-
quent COli..,.;'lent heard from legis-
lators or their aides was, " We've 
had so many students seeing us 
we haven 't been able to get any-
thing done." Other California 
schools represented included UC 
Santa Cruz, UC Berkeley, UCLA, 
and Humboldt State College. 

Reactions from legislators 
varied between agreement with 
students on the necessity of 
immediate withdrawal of U.S. 
troops from Asia (e.g . Jacob 

Â·Javits ) to defense of the Nixon 
Administration 's policies (Hugh 
Scott ). Regardless of their politi-
cal bases , many legislators 
agreed that students may have a 
significant effect on the results of 
the upcoming November elecÂ· 
tions.

of sending nch delegations to

McGill Revealed Through Stars 
.. , ... Delineations of ORACLE 

There are three factors 
which bring us to the message 
of the stars - the houses, the 
signs and the planets . It is the 
angle of the stellar ray which 
determines its effect in our 
lives. Planets in the East 
affect our physical con-
stitution ; planets in the 
South , nea r the zenith, 
determine factors concerning 
our social position, If a planet 
is setting in the West a t the 
time of our birth, its ray 
strikes us in a manner so as to 
draw us to certain life part-
nerships and marriage ; and 
the planets under the ea rth , in 
the North, have an effect 
upon our condition in the 
latter part of :tie. The twelve 
sections of tt.e circle of ob-
servation as s~en from the 
birthplace are truly said to 
govern vario lS departments 
of life , as r ecorded in the 
most ancient lore of star 
logic , and thus people born on 
the same dllY and yet at 
va rious hour s and minutes 
and in various sectors of the 
ea rth, may have the most 
diverse expe riences. 

The Ruler of the Life Chart 
is t he planet which rules the 
sign which Is ascending a t the 
t ime of birth . In Dr. M cGill 's 
chart the r ising sign is Leo, 
the sign oJ strength and 
leadership. Leo is ruled by 
the sun. The sun Is the ruler of 
Dr. McGill 's Ii/e. 

Noting the chart, we see the 
sun is in the eighth house, 
which is occupied by Pisces. 
This position f a vo rs oc"

gives a strong tendency 
towards psychic in tuition, 

and offers a possible 
in he r i tance or lucky 
marria g e. Mars in the fifth 
house activates the sun by a 
go-degree are, bestowing an 
abundance of energy and 
great Jaculty for leadership. 
Mars may indicate a fiery 
te mper, but with Pisces there 
is no room for resentments.

justice. Jupiter in the third

which will be of great benefit 
throughout life. It is a position 
which gives unerring faculty 
for sifting truth from error 
and arriving at facts. Mars in 
the fifth house with Sag it-
tarious also points to 
leadership.

Lack of Communication Widens Gap 
Between Upper and Lower Campus

One outcome of events of the 
past few weeks has been a 
greater division of attitudes be-
tween the Scripps Institution and 
the UCSD Upper Campus. 

strations at Scripps similar to the 
sit-ins held in Muir and Revelle 
buildings. 

In discussions with people on 
both campuses, one element 
which added to a feeling of 
mutual suspicion, and apparently 
has added to a mood of separa-
tion for quite some time, has been 
a basic lack of communication 
and knowledge of each other's 
activities between Scripps and

1969-70 General Catalogue.) 

As one Scripps student put it, 
" This lack becomes apparent not 
just during crisis periods, but in 
the day-to-<lay functioning of this 
campus, and in thoughts ex-
pressed by students on both 
campuses. " 

The tie with Scripps has been 
emphasized in much of the litera-
ture about UCSD, and there are 
apparently more than a few Re-
velle undergraduates who came 
to UCSD with the thought that 
they might have the opportunity 
to do some study at the Institu-
tion. But the opportunities for 
UCSD undergraduates going on 
to Scripps have always been very 
weak, by their own admission. 
The science program at UCSD 
does not prepare the Wldergrad-
uate, according to Sc ripps 
sources, for the kind of work done 
at Scripps, which emphasizes the 
life sciences and geology.

possibility of a regularly

offered by Scripps and open to 
UCSD undergraduates . Com-
ments have indicated that this is 
a viable and important consid-
eration. It would afford, say its 
supporters, an exchange of ideas 
between the two communities, 
allowing Scripps Â· faculty and 
students to get to know their 
undergraduate counterparts, and 
at the same time, perhaps allow-
ing Wldergraduates an introduc-

oceanography in general, and

There are many undergrad-

science sequences, who have 
indicated that they would ac-

course. Some even claimed that 
they might find such a course a 
relief from often tedious molecu-
lar biology courses.

the most will be eligible to graduate on June 14. And 
of those, only about 30 per cent are the same 
students who entered UCSD in September 1966. 

A"cording to the Provosts ' and the Registrar 's 
offil es , the fi gures on seniors - a nd a ny 
class - are never precise, because students enter 
and leave the campus throughout every quarter . 
Clmsequentiy class standing has little meaning 
when classifying who can go through com-
mencement and receive a handshake from his 
provost. 

By latest Gount the number of Revelle seniors 
eligible to graduate in June is about 240 out of 477 
students classed as seniors; for Muir it's 90 out of 
231. But of those 330, perhaps 5 per cent may choose 
not to receive degrees. 

AUrition Rate High 

Veterans, homemakers or people returning to 
school after working for a while are often not under 
the pressure to finish in four years. 
Many Defer Candidacy 

That is a part of the reason many of the eligible 
seniors will not declare candidacy for graduation. 
Some are seeking delay for draft reasons, but more 
students are learning-oriented rather than degree-
oriented. Tliey do not see an urgency about getting a 
degree until they have explored the ever-growing 
number of fie lds open to them. 

There remains the fact that the 700 seniors at 
UCSD now are not the same 700 that started in 1966. 
The reason so many - how many, no one seems to 
know - have dropped out or transferred are not the 
same for Mui r and Revelle. "I've gotta get my head 
together," is the reason most often given to Tyra 
Garlington, a Muir c.ounselor. 

Though a few have quit to start their own 
businesses, most are not strongly directed towards 
a goal. Most like the freedom to express themselves 
and do their own thing, but they feel as if no one 
cares. Tyra 's main concern is that many who 
stay have the same loneliness and blank expression. 

There is precedent for such a 
course or series of courses. There 
have been introductory courses 
offered through Frontiers of Sci-
ence sequences, but these have 
seldom dealt with oceanography 
or imparted any information 
about the functioning of Scripps. 
There are also professors at 
Scr ipps who. have taken on inter-
ested Wldergraduates on an indi-
vidual basis. But these measures, 

More than one visitor has been repelled by the Sit-in Aftermath 
coldness or aloofness of UCSD students, and it is by 

The TRITON TIMES has found 
that there is nothing but praise 
for such a plan . Informal polling 
indicates that interest is very 
high on this campus for a general 
course in oceanography, perhaps 
along the lines of basic courses in 
physics and biology. The scope 
and direction of such a course 
would have to be worked out , but 
most people asked felt that any 
course must be on a regular 
basis, open to the general under-
graduate community, or " the 
concept of active opportunity for 
exchange would be too limited. 
One Revelle biology major con-
cluded, " It would be very 
disappointing to think that there 
are no professors and graduate 
student:; at Scripps who would be 
interested in conducting such a 
course, because there are hordes 
of undergraduates who would 
support such a course." 

Even more significant is the attrition rate, which 
has replaced the 650 freshmen of 1966 with up to 60 
per cent transfer students . Thus only about 150 
seniors are graduating "on time," although no one 
in any office can know this for sure. (The 
Registrar 's office keeps no figures on the number of 
students who continue from year to year, drop out 
and return , or transfer permanently.) 

Anne Koch of the Revelle Provost's Office, and 
Betsy Wood and Mary Avery of the Muir Provost 's 
Office agreed on the main reasons so many seniors 
are ineligible to graduate. Many have transferred 
from junior colleges or state colleges, and while the 
units are accepted, there are often math and 
language deficiencies to be made up. They often 
lack prerequisites for their major, and a great 
number lose time by switching majors. Those who 
transfer in the winter or spring Quarters find it 
difficult or impossible to break into the second or 
Ulird part of a sequence of courses.

The "seriousness" of Revelle is due "partly to the 
type of kid we attract," according to Hazel Alksnis 
of the Revelle Provost's Office. The B-average.of

Bird atching' With Dean Beeche~ 
Futu e Opportunity Extended to All 

Susan Graves 
Staff Writer 

Most people wowu turn over and go back to sleep rather 
than go bird-watching at 6 a.m . But four students and 
Dean Ward Beecher, dean of foreign students at UCSD, 
managed to make their way to the Urey Hall mailbox 
early one morning to learn something about the birds of 
North ColUlty. "Armed" with only binoculars and 
sweatshirts for the early morning chill, they were soon to 
see a clear , sunny day with no wind emerge around them. 

For those skeptics - among the group birding that day, 
there was one - the group managed to identify three or 
four different types of birds even before leaving the 
campus. The Cliff Swallows, Imown to most of those at 
UCSD as those building their bulb-shaped nests under the 
eaves of the Humanities-Library Building and the dorms, 
were the most active in the early morning, flitting back 
and forth from little pockets of mud near the sprinklers on 
the ground to the little mud bulbs in the corners of the 
buildings. Mr. Beecher made the comment that when the 
swallows returned to Capistrano Mission in the spring, 
they also returned to all other areas of habitation the 
same day. 

Many Species Seen 
Fifty-eight species of birds were seen that day and noted 

on a real Audubon Daily Field Card. Mr. Beecher and 
students Scott Linthicum and Bruce Wallace were the 
experts in the field. The group was able to distinguish 
certain birds not only by sight, but also some by sound at 
the end of the six-hour trip. 

The birders watched from the car for a few minutes as 
they made their way to the Sorrento Valley area . Mr. 
Beecher noted that early in the morning in the little 
valleys below the eucalyptus trees near UCSD, deer could 
sometimes be seen. On this trip , however, rabbits and a 
couple of dogs were the primary mammals identified. 

Sewage processing plants drew many birds, and the 
group was able to see several birds just floating around on 
the effluent of the Sorrento Valley plant. A Cinnamon Teal 
was one shy little duck with cinnamon-colored head and 

with a touch of pale blue and green on the edge of his 

wings that didn't mind the effluent. The female, of course, 
was rather unelaborate in dress compared to her mate. 

Waddling down the dirt road near the plant, the group 's 
first California Quail was discovered. Warblers of all 
different varieties were found in nearby trees while a 
Marsh Hawk watched the countryside from the top of a 
tall tree in the middle of the valley, never moving from his 
perch the whole time the group was in the area. A Red-
tailed Hawk was teased by a small Sparrow Hawk in the 
sky nearby. The Yellow-Throated Warbler with white 
belly and black and white head was quite common in the 
brush and easy to spot for the beginners. A Killdeer was 
discovered faking a broken wing along the road. Mr. 
Beecher told the group that the Killdeer, whether or not 
she had chicks in the nest, would still play the broken wing 
act. 

Ducks Easy to Watch 
Moving on to a reserve near the turnoff to Vista from 

Highway 5, the group was able to see some of the most 
interesting birds of the outing. Domesticated ducks lined 
the marsh area and Mr. Beecher easily pointed out most 
of the types and noted some real conglomerations of types 
in others. He said that ducks were for beginners an easy 
bird to watch for they remained relatively immobile 
except for their slow waddle and humans could easily 
keep track of them. 

Most of the ducks seen were traveling in clusters of five 
or six and looked like full-busted matrons on a shopping 
trip. 

Farther inland along the marsh area, the group 
discovered two types of white Egrets. Though both were 
white , the Snowy Egret could be told from the Common 
Egret by its thin black beak and black legs and yellow feet 
compared to the Common Egret's black-tipped beak and 
yellow legs. They both have the rather S-curve-shaped 
neck and are related to the herons, the ibis (a White-
Faced Ibis was also seen in the marshland) and the Fla-
mingo. A Kingfisher hovered above the heads of the group 
and perched himself on a brach above and turned his 
famous triangular profile with the long sharp beak so that 
all could identify him.

Tanager Most BeautUul 
The most beautifully plumaged bird found, agreed the 

group, was a Western Tanager. He perched himself 
among the yellowish-green tips of a tall tree , making his 
phunage seem more elaborate. He had a red head, bright 
yellow body, and shiny black wings. According to one of 
the books the group took along to help more clearly 
identify the birds, the call of the tanager is like that of a 
hoarse robin . 

With an invitation to brunch at the Beechers, the group 
headed home along the coast to catch sight of gulls, 
sandpipers, and a pelican. 

Mr. Beecher, who can be reached in the International 
Affairs Office, Â·ext. 1936, said that he would be willing to 
take out another group some weekend in May for a few 
hours. He limited the group to about seven and had to turn 
some away at the last outing.

Native Americans are on the 
move. They have had enough of 
promises and inaction. Instead of 
being treated as a sovereign 
people, they have been treated by 
the Bureau as incompetents. 
They will not accept this and are 
militant about their freedoms. 

According to Tony Velanzuala, 
of the campus Native American 
Club, they are " trying to regain 
their rights as humans - as 

individuals - which have been 
neglected." To this end, they are 
using education as a tool to force 
the government to uphold the 
treaties they made with the In-
dians. 

The club on campus was 
"formed mainly to recruit Indian 
kids from the high schools." The 
members of the club go out into 
the high schools and talk with the 
kids there, trying to get them 
interested in college, or even 
trying to get them to stay in 
school. 

Once at the high school, they 
face the prejudice and apathy of 
the administrator, and the fear 
and apathy of the students. Art 
Hayes and Steve Halpern 
described one situation at a 
school where they were 
scheduled to have a round table 
discussion with all of the Indians 
on the campus. Instead " they put 
us in this little cubicle - a little 
room with a desk in it, and one 
chair ... and the counselor, when 
an Indian kid would pass through 
the office would stop, snap his 
fingers and say 'Hey you, in 
here!' " 

This sort of thing intimidates 
the kids so that they won't even 
talk to the club. Now the club will 
be bringing them on campus, to 
remove them from that type of 
atmosphere . 

The Native Americans are 
fighting for their very way of 
life - against the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs and for their land. 
They know they will win only by 
outsmarting these people and 
forcing them to give ground. 
They believe that the only ef-
fective way Is through education.

This is the proud and beautiful 
conception of himself that the 
Indian holds. Underneath that 
idea runs a feeling of anger. 

The anger the Indian feels is 
toward a nation that took 
everything from him and in 
return gave broken promises. 
" The Indian has learned to ex-
pect two things: that the 

group may do anything unless it 
is specifically prohibited by the 
government, ... (but ) the Indians 
may not do anything unless it is 
specifically permitted by the 
government." That quote, by 
Cohen and Manle in "Harvard 
Law Review," explains the lack 
of control an Indian has over his 
life. 

The outside control over an 
Indian 's life begins when he 
enters school. He can go to a 
public school and receive taunts 
much worse than a white child 
would receive, or he can go to a 
reservation school, the majority 
of which are boarding schools. At

is that whatever you do , you do

brought to the school and he is 
forced to compete on an in-
dividual basis." As well as being 
forced to compete, his entire 
history and culture are con-
stantly derided. He is regarded 
as " culturally deprived," and 
this label is self-fulfilling. " Our 
Brother 's Keeper" states that the 
needs of an Indian child defined 
by the BIA are " Defined and 
centered within the cultural 
Wliverse of the non-Indian world. 
The possibility that the Indian 
child may need an education 
which helps him function as an 
Indian, or that Indian parents 
might want such an education for 
their children is not considered." 
So, as one culture is substituted 
for another, a loss of identity 
results.

Saye UC from the Regents 
They ' re on the rampage aga in. That 

group of 24 dirty old men, corporate 
bosses , and pol itical hacks, who like to 
imag ine that they are competent to run 
an academic monoli th , have dipped the ir 
har::\ds in the muck once more. What 
happened regard ing Ange la Davis in-
volved more than just the emascu lation 
of UCLA's Chuck Young . It made it clear 
that the Regents, whi le t heoretica l ly 
delegating responsibili ty to the proper 
UC personnel, w i l l meddle in any ind i-
vidual case as they see f i t , and w i II def i-

n i teï¿½y apply political cr iter ia when they 
do. 

The issue of M iss Davis' credentials is 
not even worth ,discussing any further . 
The r esul ts of exhaustive investigations 
by UCLA facu lty groups should be suff i-
cient. Miss Dav is is obv ious ly em inently 
qualified academica ll y . But she is a 
Commun ist. And to the powers that be a 
Communist is somehow incapable of be-
ing objective , wh i le a cap ital ist is. 

We h ighly commend the UC L A Aca-
dem ic Senate for i ts courageous act of de-
fiance of t he Board of Regents whereby 
they vowed to allow Miss Dav is to con-
tinue teach ing by other arr angements . 
Cred it will be g iven and her sa lary pro-
vided through faculty donations. 

As for Chancellor Young , the UCLA 
facu lty seemed to be wi thhold ing judg-

ment on his actions by tabling a motion to 
give him a vote of confidence. It is felt by 
some t hat he should have put h is job on 
the line in the Angela Davis decision . 
Young has surely gone to great pains to 
judge the Davis case objectively and has 
supported her at great risk to his own 
career ; it is di fficult to expect a man to 
give up his own career ; it is difficult to 
expect a man to give up his own aspira -
ti ons . But we m ight ask Young to con-
sider whether the university he must ad-
minister after sav ing his neck will be 
worth being chancellor of, especially in 
l ight of the obviously limited authority he 
now has. 

Young's efforts may go for naught if he 
refuses to take a stand at the crucial 
point . If the Davis case proceeds as is 
currently indicated, we may all regret 
that Young didn ' t take a stand _ Yes, we 
know that he who succeeds Young may be 
Reagan 's man, but where are we going to 
get by continually capitulat ing on that 
basis? 

The UCLA faculty is on the right track. 
Sit-ins, protests, and the like will not help 
in the long run _ We need the faculty and 
adm inistrators to stand up now and say 
" HELL, NO!" We must defy the Regents 
by circumventing or ignoring thei r direc-
ti ves and proceeding as we, the true aca-
dem ic constituency, see fit . 

The Academic Senate Has failed 
The Academ ic Senate is presently in-

capable of effectively dea li ng wi th cr ises . 
Excuses that the facul ty member s did not 
create the cr ises or that the cr ises wou ld 
not have ari sen had people worked 
through channels are invali d . The Senate 
has pr oved incapable of either taking 
preventative action before cri ses or 
acting to reli ev e crises which have 
already occured . 

First of all, the Senate does not respond 
ser iously to student expressions of gr ie-
vance . Channels do ex ist in theory for 
VOIC ing student Opin iOn , but faculty 
comm ittees are incl ined to make light of 
student petit ions unti I the students take 
actions demonst rat ing thei r ser iousness . 

The faculty m ust recogn ize that, wh i le 
students do not possess degrees or 
tenure , t hey are never theless th inking 
human beings with ideas worth more 
than a patron izing hear ing out . At UCLA, 
the Senate has formed a Comm ittee on 
Student We lfare . Such a com mittee at 
UCSD which would seek out problems of 
concern to students and present them to 

6 Triton Times May 22 , 1970 

the Senate with serious proposals for 
action would be a giant step forward. The 
most important change necessary is for 
faculty members to start tak ing students 
ser iously . 

Unfortunately, preventative action is 
not suff icient . Steps must be taken to 
enable the Senate to deal quickly and 
effectivel y with emergencies . Fortu -
nately , such steps are now being taken. 
Next year the Executive and Policy 
Committee will be inaugurated with 
powers to act in emergencies . It will 
consult with students and the chancellor 
in deciding upon actions . In addition, 
Senate Chairman Gabriel Jackson has 
indicated that he wishes to amend the 
Senate byÂ·laws to enable the Senate to 
call spec ial meetings more quickly. Un -
doubtedly , other means to make the 
Senate more effective in emergencies 
can be found . The consequences of future 
cr ises mandate that all possibilities be 
thoroughly explored by the faculty.

question of current political policy but of the 
right of a people to self-<letermination. The 
problem, then, lies in the double question of 
whether or not self-detennination should be 
maintained for Jews, and whether the 
solution suggested in the form of Israel , 
Zionism, should be given assent and support 
as a workable answer . 

It has been suggested that Jews try a 
method other than the contemporary answer 
offered by Zionism to the question of self-
determination. However , national autonomy 
(or Jewish National Liberation, Zionism, in 
the specific case of Israel ) stands as the only 
path known, to date, by which a people's 
un assimilated existence and self-
development can hope for protection . 

In the singular example of Judaism, the 
past two thousand years have seen Jews 
li ving a dispersed existence, dependent on the 
will of whatever cOlUltry they fOood them-
selves in, and living lives lacerated by the 
terrors of the Inquisition, the furnaces of 
Auschwitz , the pogroms of Russia; a spiritual 
life stifled under the impossible burden of 
universal humiliation and political 
repression. 

We have spent the past two millenia living 
the alternative to the national solution . That 
is enough. 

It is not an easy, popular thing to be a Jew, 
or a Black, or a Chicano, for to identify 
oneself with a people means active effort, 
involvement. Silence is a far easier path , but 
at its end the traveler finds himself subtly 
changed, somehow disinterested, apathetic 
toward involvement of any kind , for any 
people.

Bruedner States 
Opinion on W,. 

Editor : 
In the past months, my activi-

ties as a professor, scientist, and 
academic administrator have 
been reviewed at least twice by 
publications of the SDS. These 
articles contained a mixture of 
truth and fabrication . Last week 
in the TRITON TIMES, an article 
by Sinai. Rand was published in 
which 1 was characterized as 
"the nwnber one warlord" at 
UCSD, this opinion apparently 
deriving from the earlier SDS 
articles together with other ru-
mors circulating at UCSD. While 
I regard this label (perhaps Su-
preme Warlord would be better) 
as rather comical, I would prefer 
that its assignment to me be 
based on more accurate know-
ledge than has been available to 
the UCSD students (and faculty ). 

Many questions are now being 
raised concerning the relation-
ship of the universities and of the 
faculty to the DOD, to the Fed-
eral Government, to the Asian 
war , etc. My views on these prob-
lems are : 

1) The Vletnam-Laos-Camoo. 
dian War 
The U. S. policy has deterior-
ated to a position of deep im-
morality and military looacy. 
We should withdraw imme-
diately. 
2) DOD Research Support 
The U. S. Congress and Admin-
istration should be persuaded 
immediately to transfer re-
search funds from the DOD 
fooding agencies to NSF or 
e qui v al ent non -mil i tary 
channels. During this transi-
tion period, the universities 
should accept DOD funds only 
if the work is ooclassified and if 
the DOD agencies maintain , as 
prior to 1968, a policy of non-in-
terference with the research 
within the most general defini-
tion of long-range research 
goals . If these conditions 
cannot be met, the universities 
should terminate the DOD 
fooding . 
3) Classified Research (DOD 

and AEC) 
The lUliversities should termi-
nate any association with 
classified research. In particu-
lar , UC should terminate the 
management of the AEC wea-
pons laboratories, the classi-
fied laboratories of SIO, and 
any other similar activities. 
4) Present UCSD Academic 
Structure 
The rapid growth of UCSD in 
science and technology during 
the first decade as a general 
campus (1959-1969) has led to 
an oobalanced faculty and stu-
dent structure, detrimentally 
affecting the over-all quality of 
UCSD as a university, and 
retarding the growth in hu-
manities, social sciences, and 
fine arts. Every effort should 
be made by the UCSD faculty 
and administration to establish 
an academic structure more 
appropriate to the present.

Guns on c.pus 
The following letter was sent to 
Governor Reagan : 

Dear Governor Reagan, 
In the vital interests of safety 

and sanity, I urgently implore 
you at this time and henceforth to 
forbid the possession or carrying 
of any and all kinds of guns or 
firearms, loaded or IUlloaded, at 
any time, by anyone-student, 
faculty member or staff em-
ployee ; visitor ; campus, city or 
state police ; national guards ot' 
federal troop~n any campus of 
the University of California and 
State College system in Cali-
fornia . 

We may contmue to expect 
altercations and brawls, unfortuÂ· 
nately, but we must have no more 
wmecessary tragedies on cam-
puses in this supposedly civilized 
colUltry. I hope that you will do 
everything in your power to pre-
vent them. 

j I, 

Respectfully yours,

"'eatre Praised 
Editor : 

I commend the actors and ac-
tresses of the UCSD Theater for 
their parts in "A Midswnmer 
Night's Dream" and "The Cau-
casian Chalk Circle," acted on 
alternate nights throughout the 
rWl . Their excitement and enthu-
siasm overcame the limitations 
of primitive stage facilities and 
the relatively high room tem-
perature. The simple costuming 
and staging added, rather than 
detracted, to the shows, in that 
they allowed the audience 's at-
tention to be focused on the ac-
ting. 

The enthusiasm which over-
came obstacles created limita-
tions on the standard of the over-
all performance . The farce of 
" Dream" became more farcical 
as stimulated physical actions 

drowned many words . In "Cir-
cle" loud shouts in a small thea-
ter tended to overdramatize ser-
ious drama especially in the first 
act where pessimism is the mood. 

I look forward to future produc-
tions. 

Yours sincerely, 
Clive Glickman 

Anti-War Veterans

dents and the community of the 
reactions of veterans opposed to 
the war . Through the use of infor-
mational leaflets and speakers, 
we plan to dispel the myths that 
have been perpetrated about 
veterans and their feelings 
toward war. We feel in this 
respect that we are in a particu-
larly ooique position to educate 
the community concerning 
United States involvement in 
Southeast Asia and other areas in 
the world. 

We respect the right of indi-
viduals to express their actions 
through dissent as their con-
science dictates. Any actions of 
violence on the part of individuals 
in this organization is not repre-
sentative of the group as a whole.

Academic Senate 
Editorial Continued 

continued from page 6 

Finally , attention must be 
given to the conduct of the 
meetings themselves. Faculty 
members must agree to cooper-
ate to expedite Senate meetings. 
This last Senate meeting which 
required a solid week to complete 
a . twelve item agenda was a 
shocking failure in these terms. 
Faculty members repeatedly 
extended debate by not speaking 
to the motions, saying much 

more than necessary , and most 
disruptive of all, using parlia-
mentary tricks rather than 
straightforwardly indicating 
their desires. The faculty 
members indulging in these 
actions may believe that they are 
somehow improving the 
meeting ' s function , but the 
general effect is to make a 
mockery of the democratic 
process. 

In swnmary, a great deal of the 
problem lies in the faculty itself, 
and it is the duty of faculty 
members individually and collecÂ· 
tively to remedy the situation 
before they lose whatever voice 
they have in determining the 
future of the ooiversity.

Lesson One 

Bruce Geller 
Arts Writer 

a Bore 
At the entrance to the Guild 

theatre, there are two people, a 
policeman checking iden-
tification (you must be 21 to get 
in) and a woman collecting five-
dollar bills for tickets. (That 's 
right, $5 per person .) The 
audience consisted of several 
duos, two couples, two bald-
headed men, and two UCSD 
students , 

Dave Sacherman 
Arts Writer 

)ederico Fellini's most recent 
,ork, "Fellini Satyricon," is a bi-
'lrre, grotesque hallucination of 

',alUlting beauty. Sadly, it is also 
agmented in contin~ity, 
al,ow in thought, and ulti-

" â¢ .':Itely monotonous. 
"Satyricon II is Fellini's docu-

1 I. ntary of a dream of antiquity 
and his adaptatipn of the bawdy 
satiric novel of Petronius written 
in the first Century A.D. The 
director also co-authored the 
'SCreenplay (Italian with English 
;ubtitles) and seems to be using 
the pre-Christian Roman world of 
::Iebauchery dW'ing the time of 
Nero as an analogue of the 
-nodem post-Christi~ . period . 

The ftlm follows stuaent-hero 
~ncolpius, his boy-lover Giton, 

Â·qho has the constancy of a cloud, 
Id his best friend, Ascyltus, as 
.ey wander across the face of 

. 'Ie Roman Empire, either parti-
cipating in (often as victims) or 
just observing orgies, feasts, 
festivals, mW'ders, arid abduc-
tions. Fellini has created an eerie 
subterranean world of magic and 
superstition, a world without 
values, government, faith , or 
conscience. It is an orgiastic 
world of human beasts and mon-
sters, of bloated, deformed 
freaks used to represent mystery 
and depravity. 

Purveying the glamor of 
Nickedness (though he seems to 
!Je saying that it's fWl that can't 
r eally be enjoyed) , his film is one 
long orgy of eating, drinking , 
:-ruelty, and copulation. Fellini 
appears to go all the way wi~ his 
infatuation with transvestism, 
nymphomania , and homosex-
uality to convey the idea that 
man without belief in God is a 
lecherous beast. He portrays a 
time when to be rich meant to be 
excessive. The people did not 
consume ; they indulged, 

However, his "Satyricon" is aU 
phantasmagoria and the fresco 
effect becomes not only monoto-
nous but a bit oppressive, He 
never does involve us as in true 
theatre of cruelty. During most of 
it, the viewer merely moves past 
groups of people exhibiting their 
grossness and abnormalities, a 
parade of leering , grinning 
cripples. There are moments 
when Fellini seems to have fallen 
into the cinema of the ridiculous 
and we ask oW'selves: Is this 
dwarf or this latest amputation 
really necessary? 

"Satyricon" is a confusing tale 
which never ends. The film 
iimply stops in mid-sentence. But 
one should not completely dis-
count the film, for if Fellini does 
not allow the viewer to arrive at 
understanding , he does offer him 
a poetic vision and a movie of his 
wildest dreams . The most 
spectacular aspect of the film,

which is essentially descriptive 
rather than narrative or histori-
cal, is the decor and the color. 
Some of the set designs have a 
truly hypnotic quality, such as 
one depicting a ship which 
resembles a sea serpent. There 
are many beautiful images that 
seem like painted EI Greco can-
vasses. Everything has been in-
vented by the director, who has 
relied solely on his own imagina-
tion. Fellini scorns natW'al sun-
light, so even exterior landscapes 
have been photographed to 
suggest the exotic, steamy inter-
iors . The lighting is dreamlike : 
much darkness, night scenes, 
dimly lit interiors, and land-
scapes drenched in faded, Wlreal 
sun shines suggestive of an in-
ferno. The rooms are claustro-
phobic and nothing ' is airy or 
bright . 

The cast is a multi-national 
melange of amateW's and pro-
fessionals, and though almost all 
of the women are harpies of 
terrifying scale, " Satyricon" is 
no more about homosexuality 
than about ancient Rome. It is a 
surreal epic, often mysteriously 
beautiful , but ultimately a rather 
grotesque, disappointing bore, 

The film begins with a lecture 
on sex education by a man who 
bears a strange resemblance to a 
Tijuana taxi driver I once met. 
The lecture first takes on the 
nature of a seventh grade sex-
education class, with En-
cyclopedia Brittanica-type 
charts as visual aids. However, 
after impatiently listening to the 
lecture for several minutes, 
thoroughtly convinced that the 
movie bore redeeming social 
value, the real props were 
brought out - the Man and his 
Wife ( both are ostensibly 
wearing wedding rings, so fear 
not ), The couple (actually there 
were two couples, but I couldn 't 
tell them apart) go through the 
various positions of intercourse, 
with the narrator providing an 
erudite rWlning conunentary on 
what is transpiring. After wat-
ching 10 or 20 different positions, 
I left the theatre. The thrill had 
been minimal, and I had learned 
little more than it takes two.

Bruce Geller 
Arts Writer 

If you're a college student and the naked lady is a guest lecturer in 
your sex education class, you would probably show little surprise and 
respond as you would to any other lecturer. If however , you're a 
middle-aged woman and find yourself in a similar situation, you would 
probably scream and run out of the classroom, 

The candid camera is again on the loose-but this time its peering 
eyes pry into the wonderful world of sex. Allen Funt, directing his first 
movie, has the op'portunity to present many scenes that never would 
have made it on Sunday night television- Priscilla Goodbody and the 
network censors would have had fits . 

The fibn, though very entertaining and amusing, provides few real 
surprises for the hard-core college student. I feel rather safe in assum-
ing, especially in light of audience reaction, that most in the above-30 
generation would be rather shocked by how far things have progressed 
in this area, Even Allen Funt seems to have gotten something out of 
the filming, He learns to use the word "balling" instead of "get very 
intimate with" from interviewing well-experienced Greenwich Village 
hippies. 

"Naked Lady" currently co-features with "Medium Cool" at the 
California Theater. They made for the most interesting evening I have 
spent at the movies this year .

mural Interest Soars 
Rocky Bailon 
Sports Writer 

For years now there has been a 
rumor that UCSD is not one of the 
" Sport Powerhouses '" of the 
nation, attracting the strong of 
mind ( ? ), but not of body. In light 
of this fascinating contention it 
should be noted that there were 48 
teams signed for intramural 
softball, which means a total 
participation of nearly 600 
students. 

In view of the wide acclaim 
that Intramurals have received 
throUihout the year with football, 
basketball, softball, and coun-
tless other sports, I would like to 
suggest that a comparative look 
should be given to the intramural 
and intercollegiate department 
budgets, taking nothing away 
from our excellent voneyball 
team (which often puts us in the 
news); but also keeping in mind 
the outstanding participation in 
intramurals and the poor gate in 
intercollegiates. 

would mean immediate benefits 
to the student body; backstops 
for softball, better fields for all 
sports, better and more efficient 
equipment, the possibilities are 
endless. 

Thinclads Hit Final Hurdle, 
NAIA Meet Ends Season 

Robert Miller 
Sports Writer 

For UCSD to get 600 of 
anything together, not to speak of 
600 rally-worn veterans, out into 
the playing field is a major ac-
complishment, a great deal of 
credit should be given to the 
intramurals people, led by that 
jolly Purple Gopher Lee Johnson. 

I would like to see a bit more 
consideration given to the in-
tramural department at our next 
budget meeting. A better budget 

My hopes for UCSD to become 
a " Power House" in sports is not 
dead, but it is virtually unfeasible 
to think that that goal can be 
accomplished now. Our school is 
too small and too uninterested in 
" glory" games. Therefore the 
~kely follow-up is a beefed up 
mtramural program. 

In closing, a big word of thanks 
should go to all the people who 
participated, and future 
congratulations to the Deanza 
boys, who proved that 
motherhood and apple pie only 
come second to wine, women and 
song, as they were beaten by the 
arch villains the Purple Gophers 
(good luck at Davis). 

The NAIA Track and Field 
Olampionships for District III 
were held on May 15 and 16 at 
Wesbnont College and La Playa 
Stadium in Santa Barbara. Cal 
Western and Redlands finished 
first and second, respectively. 
UCSD finished last in a field of 
fourteen teams with a total of five 
MintS. 

The principal function of the 
District Olampionships was to 
qualify perfonners for the NAIA 
National Track and Field 
Olampionships to be held in 
Billings, Montana on June 5 and 
6. The Triton team did not place 
anyone in the finals at Billings; 
however, the 14-member team 
did place three of its athletes into

Steve Garofolo placed fifth in 
the discus with a toss of 131 feet. 
In the high jump, Bob Lemmon 
leaped over the bar at 6 feet 2 
inches to place in the event. Don 
Nelson continued his im-
provement in the pole vault by 
reaching a level of 13 feet to place 
fifth . 

Several other members of the 
Triton squad did not qualify for 
the District III finals, but they did 
turn in creditable perfonnances. 
In the 440-yard relay the Triton 
team of Jay Harrison, Joe Mc-
Carthy, Phil Beauchamp, and 
Bob Lemmon ran a 43.8 to place 
seventh in their heat. Bob 
Holzinger ran a 2:03.4 in the first 
heat of the 880 yeard run to place 
seventh, while Dave Robinson 
ran a 2:08. Steve Ivy participated 
in the javelin throw, but he too 
did not place. 

Bob Lemmon did not qualify in 
the 120 yard high hurdles as he 
was unable to finish. Jerry King 
suffered an unfortunate fall in the 
3000 meter steeplechase which all 
but knocked him out of the race. 
According to Coach Andy Skief, 
theperfonnances, except for Bob 
Lemmon's run in the 120 yard 
high hurdles,- accurately 
represented UCSD's per-
fonnance in Santa Barbara. 

UCSD footba" 
Team Sought 

A revitalized interest in an 
intercollegiate football program 
at UCSD has been initiated by 
two Revelle College freshmen 
Paul Mitsch and Mike Ditoma~. 
Athletic Director Howard Hunt 
has approved a tentative 
program pending the response of 
mterested students. 

A student referendum last year 
eliminated intercollegiate 
football on this campus by 
defeating a player request for 
financial aid . Mirsch and 
Ditomaso have proposed the 
reinstatement of football as a 
club type of operation with 
competition with other schools of 
similar enrolhnent and athletic 
philosophies. There would be no 
financial aid to the players, and 
athletes would compete on their 
own incentive in the same 
manner as basketball and 
baseball. 

The expenses in this program 
would be minimal , since UCSD 
already has complete football 
equipment in storage, and the 
new coach would probably come 
from the ranks of the Tritons' 
present Athletic Department 
staff. 

Undergraduate men students 
at UCSD who are interested in 
competing in football next Fall 
should contact Coach Hunt's 
office in the Physical Education 
Department (campus ext . 2275) 
and leave their names and phone 
numbers before next Friday, 
May 29. If the response is suf-
ficient, an organizational 
meeting will be arranged and 
plans will be made for Spring and 
Fall practice sessions as well as a 
1970 schedule . 

Students Unpaint Revelle 
SUIIUI Graves 
StaHWrlter 

Twenty-foW' UCSD students of various political 
backgrounds formed an "unpalnting" party 
Saturday to remove the slogans painted on the walls 
of Revelle College buildings. 

According to Revelle senior Ouis Bibb and junior 
Susan Graves, who organized the party, the group 
had no political orientation, but was composed of 
students who were upset about the defacement of 
Revelle's architectlD'e and who felt that the damage 
harmed rather t~an helped anyone's cause. 

The group ran from those who sympathized with 
the UCSD students' efforts to end the war to those 
backing President Nixon in his efforts. 

Jim Williams, a Muir senior originally from 
Virginia, said that he had come to see UCSD as his 
home and though he may have agreed with some of 
the slogans, he felt that his home need not be 
defaced by the blotches of paint unesthetically 
splashed across the buildings. 

~im Williams and Chris Bibb, both graduating 
thl.S ~une, also said they wanted to make the 
bwldings presentable for Commencement. 

Music Dept. 
Center Opens 

Terry Barak 
Arts Writer 

Members of the UCSD Music 
Department opened a Music 
Mo bilization and Information 
Center (MMIC) yesterday. The 
center, which is located in the 
music recital room on Matthews 

~pus (MC 4(9 ), will be open 
dally, Monday through Friday, 
from noon to 1 or 2 p.m. 

According to its sponsors in the 
Music Department, "MMIC will 
include both planned and in-
formal activities, and prepare 
tapes of daily activity for 
eventual radio transmission . 
Underway are programs for 
mobile musical units for off-
campus propaganda and protest 
purposes, and jam sessions as 
needed . New proposals are en-
couraged. Anything that 
promotes the use of music as a 
social and political force to 
protest illegal and immoral acts 
of war perpetrated by our 
government at home and abroad 
are appropriate." 

In addition, a booth will be set 
up on the lawn area in front of the 
Matthews Campus cafeteria in 
order to attract attention to the 
movement and to direct people to 
the recital room. â¢ 

MMIC urges everyone to come 
. out and join in their activities. To 

sch~d.ule a session, contact 
mUSICians, or arrange electronic 
help for your socio-politico-
musical efforts, or just to find out 
what is going on, call 4S3-EDNA.

Every once in a while during the day students 
would come over to watch the workers and join in a 
few moments later with sponge in hand. 

Several of the students in the party had worked in 
th.e student-community groups sent out to the San 

Di.e~o area and many had commented on the bad 
feelings the defacement of the buildings had caused. 

The group used a number of special cleaners to 
remove the tempera and oil-base paints from the 
rough surfaces. Gloves, rags, sponges, brushes and 
several cleaners were furnished by Physical Plant 
and acetone was furnished by one of the chemistr; 
laboratories in Urey Hall. 

John ~petina, head of Hi-Continental (UCSD's 
food set'Vlce), donated lunches and beverages to 
those participating in the clean-up. 

Durmg one morning coffee break of the Academic
