UNIVERSIN OF CALI 

By MARK SANDERSON. SUJff Writer 

M ORE than a year after its inception, UC San Diego's alcohol policy 
continues to raise quesnons 
regarding student drinking 
habits, alternative social 
programming, and liability in 
instances where alcohol IS 
present. 

When students walked on 
campus at the beginmng of the 
1985-86 school year, they were 
met with a newly implemented 
alcohol policy which drastically 
altered the social life at UCSD. 
The revised policy prohibits the 
consumption of alcohol in all 
public and private areas of 
university property by anyone 
under 2l. 

There has been much 
speculation as to why a campus 

wide policy revision was 
necessa1)'. According to Dr. 
Joseph Watson, Vice Chancellor 
of Undergraduate Affairs, the 
regulation was revised in order 
for there to be "greater 
uniformity" among the college's 
individual alcohol policies; there 
had been "increased diSCiplinary 
problems," there were liability 
considerations; and there was a 
need to "clarify what perceived 
and accepted behavior should be 
(in terms of alcohol use)." 

Watson believes the previous 
"undefined policy" gave students. 
as well as others, "the perception 
that drinking was condoned by 
the university." 

Alcohol has always played a 
major role in the college

environment and UCSD is no 
exception. 

In a 1983 Alcohol and 
Substance Abuse Committee 
repon, it was found that out of a 
sample pool of 283 Warren 
students. all of them drank at 
one time or another. Of these 
students the average amount of 
alcohol consumed was 3.29 
drinks per outing (where alcohol 
was served). The maJonty of 
these students drank on Fnday 
and Sarurda mghts. 

The Effects 
Although the policy has not 

stopped students from drinking, 
it has. at the vel)' least. altered 
the social habits of a majority of 
UCSO's undergraduate 
population. Among the most 

visible effects are an increase in 
off-campus parties, including 
trips to Tij uana (where the 
drinking age is 18L heightened 
interest In the Greek community 
and other primarily social 
organtzations; and decreased 
support of on-campus SOCial 
programming where alcohol IS 
not served . 

As recendy a two years ago 
tudents. regardless of age. were 

able to partake In eve nt where 
beer and other alcoholic 
beverages were served. Alcohol 
was often present at parties and 
dances held in campus 
dormitories and apartments. 
Although each college dealt with 
its presence in a slightly different 
manner. it was not, at the time.

1uir College Resident Dean,

campus d isclplmary problems 
have decreased sin e the campus 
wide alcohol policy was 
implemented , ' The a lcohol p olicy 
has had a d ramatic Impact on 
the campus resident population , 
and I think it is a very positive 
change ... the number of alcoh ol 
related incidences has dropped 
considerably," Jones saId . 

UCSD's Greek Community 

Of the pos ible effects 
auributable to the alcohol policy, 
the rise in frate rnity and sorority 

attributes the h eightened interest 
to "a need for a fTihation ." He 
added , "the growth might be due 
to more conservative altitudes 
and the automa tic social life 
(found through Greek 
affiliation)." McCambridge does 
concede, though , that the lack of 
al o hol on campus has c aused 
stude nts to look elsewhere . 

Traditionally , the open rush 
pan ics held to a ttract new 
fra ternity members included 
alcoh ol. "Open rush pa n ies." 
McCambridge said , "were very 
popular ... people go to d rink, 
that's a fact." 

Rece ndy, th ough, inc reased 
alcohol awareness has lessened 
the chance that such "op en 
part ies" will be h eld in th e 
future . McCamb ridge stated , "We 
are tryi ng to promote a dry rush 
next year." The reason for such a 
step is the difficulty in 
controlling and containing rush 

. I pa rties. 
Promoting a "dry rush" is not 

the only move fra ternities are 
taking to curb e xcessive alcohol 
use . Several fratemities have 
endorsed a re solution concerning 
alcohol. 

Among the points stated are: 

Alcohol IS no longer th e main ingredient at UCSD on-campus pamcs. 

" . . . the possession , use , sal~ 
and / o r consumption o f alcoholic 
beverages .. . shall be in 
cornpltance with all applicable 
laws ; moderation be encouraged

AS senator receives 
light punishment 
By PETEJl MESSROBIAN 

The Muir College Judiciaty Board punished AS Senior Senator 
Greg MacCrone with a written repnmand and prohibited him from 
entering the offices of the New Indicator Collective for his May 28 
physical assault .on Montgomery Kroopkin at an Associated 
Students Council meeting, 

The Board's punishment is in response to Its verdict two weeks 
ago when Mik:Crone was f ' und guilty of section 7 of the Srudent 
Conduct Code which prohil its "phYSIcal abuse, threats of violence, 
or conduct that threatens the health or safety of any person on 
'University propeny or in connection with official Uni~rsity 
funcdons." 

The defendant's reaction to me sentence was one of elation. 'Tm 
stoked: said MacCrone, who caned the decision "fair and 
judicious." 

He praised the Board, which he sits on when not a defendant, for 
"seeing through inconsistencies and contradictions of Kroopkin's 
tale: and calling me charges "fictional." 

MacCrone believes that although he is a member of the Board, 
which is composed of membtrs of the College Council, it acted as 
an impattial body in this case. '" did not sit in at the meeting where I 
was found guilty, and I did not sit in at the sentencing," the Muir 
studem said. "Therefore, there was no way I could ha\Oe influenced 
any of the proceedingi." 

Claiming that it is always his goal to avoid confrontatiOns, 
MacCrone does not anticipate any similar conOiets in the future, 

.Kroopkin, an alumni oCUCSD, had something quite different to 
say about the whole affair. "It is Simultaneously a slap on the wrist 
&:l a pat on me back," he said, "and is reaBy no pwtishment at aB. 
The UnNetsity is condomng right-wing vi~nce against 
prop:ssWes, .. The left wtU take any action we feel is necessary to 
ptOleCt ounelves." 

He felt it was improper for the Judicial bid to hear the case 
because ofM.cCrone's poskioo on itandaJgUCd that a cue officer 
should ha\Oe been appoimed to ~ the job. 

"The sentence should have been at least a year's probation from 
student govemmem,"said Kroopkin, dif not a dismissal from the 
University," 

Muir CoIleAe Dean, C,Jwies "Chips" Dreilinger, who has the 
opDon to eafOrce. lessen, or Increase the Board's recommended 
pimU;bmem said. "' will enforce the Board's decision. I think it's a 
lair punishment considering the circumstances." 1m

SDSU Daily Aztec defies 
state editorial policy 
By JOHN SINGH 

In direct defiance of the 
California State University 
regulation which prohibits 
unsigned political editorials, San 
Diego State University'S Daily 
Aztec printed endorsements of 
political candidates in an 
editorial whic h appeared in 
Tuesday's issue . 

"It is clearly a violation of our 
freedom of speech and the right 
of free press to say that we can't 
endorse candidates," ,said R. 
Andrew Rathbone, Aztec editor-
in-chief. "It 's a discriminatory 
policy on behalf of the board of 
trustees." 

Neither the University of 
California nor the California 
Community College systems have 
any such regulations on record , 
and Rathbone said he does not 
understand why the policy only 
affects CSU system.

endorsed Democrat Tom Bradley 
for governor and libertarian 
Norma Jean Almodovar for 
lieutenant governor, appeared

less than two months after Gov. 
George Deukmejian vetoed a bill 
that would have allowed 
unsigned political editorials to 
appear if they carried a 
disclaimer noting that the views 
represented only those of the 
newspaper staff. 

"(That bill) passed the senate 
and passed the assembly, but 
Gov. Deukmejian vetoed it. It's 
been said he did that because 
college newspapers traditionally 
,endorse Democrats and he's a 
'Republican. That's the only 
reason I could see for it ," 
Rathbone said . 

"We think that any law that 
would prohibit us from free press 
and free speech is 
unconstirutional," he said . 

SDSU President Thomas B. 
Day, however, said the 
constirutionality of the regulation 
is not the Issue . 

"What I'm addressing is the 
premeditated defiance of the 
regulation: Day said . "As long as 
it's there, I don 't believe you 
should defy it." 

Day said there were other 
ways Rathbone could have 
challenged the regulation . In a 
letter to Rathbone dated 
November 4 , Day said : "Having 
failed by the Legislative-
Executive route to change a 
policy srudent editors feel is 
unconstitutional, the Court route 
was open for a month. Defiance 
of policy when routes of redress 
are possibly is inexplicable ." 

"For the past two years , we've 
endorsed candidates and 
propositions, and (the 
regulation) has never been 
enforced on this campus ," 
Rathbone said . 

In his letter, Day placed 
Rathbone on 24-hour suspension 
from his position beginning at 
12:01 am, November 11 , but has 
not permanently removed him 
from his post on the award-
winning newpaper; this is unlike 
the results of a similar case two 
years ago at Humboldt State 
University. 

That may be due to the Aztec's 

AIOI 

identification as an auxiliary 
o rganization in the CSU system. 
SDSU pays fo r the newspaper's 
electricity and supplies free 
o ffice space, but all other 
expenses, including salaries, are 
paid for by advertising which , 
Rathbone said , makes up for 
"about 99.9 percent" of the 
revenue .

Commie bashing? 
Editor: 

The greatest impediment in 
obtaining a meaningful arms 
control agreement with our so-
called nemesis, the Soviet Union, 
isn't so much President Reagan's 
ill- onccived trategic Defense 
Initiative (SOl), so much as it is 
the President himself. 

In fact, before Reagan caused 
the abrupt aborting of the 
Iceland Summit on October ii, 
be ause of his steadfast refusal to 
negotlate SOl, or .. tar Wars," as 
It is more popularly known , more 
progress had been achieved in 
the formal Geneva conferences 
than had been gained during the 
entire six-year tenure of the 
Reagan Administration. 

Without a doubt, real headway 
had bee n made in Geneva pnor 
to Reagan's meddling in 
ReykjaVik. The (\vo superpowers 
had already rca hed several arms 
control agreements, most notably: 
Soviet concessions on medium 
range nuclear weapons now 
implanted in missile Silos across 
Asia and Eastern Europe , which 
had been tled to real slrategic-
weapons reductions on our side . 
Geneva should have been the 
ICing on the cake , so to speak. 
Instead, the Pre Ident , m crfect, 
crushed the cake in one fell 
swoop with his inSistence that 
SOl not be compromised . 

Reagan's stubbomess 
negotiating Star Wars was not 
because the Soviets were 
proposing a bad deal but 
because the PreSident had 
preVIOusly deCided to capltahze 
on the summit for purel)' 
political reasons. 

Indeed , the PreSident IS, and 
was. commmed not toward 
gaining a Icgltlmate pea e treaty 
with the Russians but with 
bolstenng hiS own Image among 
the American people . By 
onnnuing to "talk tough" 10 

Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, 
Reagan hoped to use his newly 
gained ammunition In fueling 
the fledging politlcal campaigns 
of fellow Republican 
ongressmen and senators across 

the Uni ted States. 

October 16 found that more than 
half the respondents blamed 
Gorbaehev, not Reagan, for the 
summit's failure and that 68 
percent beheved Reagan should 
not negotiate on SOl one iota. 
Such is the su C5S of the 
President's rhetoric. 

A side-effect of this ruse is 
that the more local , immediate 
issues, such as the farm criSIS , 
high unemployment , lower wages 
for the working class majority 
and other social ills tend to be 
discarded in favor of the 
"Commie-bashing." 

By continuing to play pan y-
hne politics with the arms talks , 
Reagan has effectively poisoned 
any hope of achieving an)' sort 
of arms reduction treaty during 
his remaining tWO years in office. 

In the meantime, the United 
States and the Soviet Union will 
no doubt continue adding to 
their respective Atomic weapons 
sto kpiles of some 50,000 
warheads, to the tune of six 
nuclear bombs, each , per day.

The trees are faUing. One of 
the pleasures of walking across 
this campus has been the 
eucalyptus trees, even If they are 
planted in rows. (The rows were 
the work of the U.S. Marines 
when this was a base instead of 
a campus. It is eene when an 
Institution so exactly conforms to 
its stereotypes): Trees in rows are · 
distinctly bener than no trees, 

and now the trees are falling, 
whole swatches of them, 
especially around the Central 
Library. And that is especially roo 
bad. 

Anyone who sees it even once 
knows that Central is a 
remarkable building, poised like 
a nmched , squared-ofT spacesh ip 
at the edge of wha t you do nor 
even realize is a canyon unless 
you ghmpse it from the north 
(say Gilman Drive) or 1-5 
heading south . From out there , if 
you see it at all, you see all of it, 

Edi,tor: 
We would like to express our 

appreciation to Matt Cronin for 
his support and dedication to the 
Guardian. For the past two years, 
Matt's insight and ability to share 
his wisdom has generated 
concern among UCSD srudents 
and faculty. 

We are indebted to Man ror his 
relentless concern for the

Thank you. T_ Guardia Editorial SIMI 
outlined against [he trees, 
sudden and sharp. 

But if you come at it from 
almost anywhere on campus, it is 
cunously IOvis lble amongst its 
trees. That's astonishing: that 
anythl ng so big can so nearly 
disappear. Sometimes as you 
walk towards It on a day of sun 
and cloud , you see only the trees 
- tall, white columns of their 
trunks and random clumps of 
long, whippy, grey-green leaves 

- you know you're nearl y in the 
library, and you can't see it. The 
glass gives you back the blue of 
the sky, mottled white of cloud; 
the cement holds the color of the 
douds and eucalyptus trunks; 
and wi th the building's blocky 
lines broken by the many armed 
trees, it almost disappears . 

I think it wond erful that 
something so big and bulky and 
dete rminedly mod em as Central 
library can fit so quietly, so we ll , 
into a natura l environme nt, a 
wood . 

But now the woods are 
disappearing. The whole grove to 
the cast went down fo r the 
earthquake test building and its 
compute r music companion , 
those big grey cement and red 
trim hulks between Central and 
the Canyon View Recreation 
area. Okay. I und erstand about a 
new building. But who deci ded 
to take down the last stri p of 
trees to the north of those new 
buildi ngs and put in a neat 
executive lawn? Another batch of 
trees ha! fa llen to its north , and 
most debilitating to one's view of 
the library , a plot of trees to the 
south si ts now as a fie ld of 
stumps. That shifting screen of 
leaves wh ich transfo rmed a 
building into an experience is 
gone. Now, as you approach the 
library fro m the SOUth - as 
many people do, s ince th at's 
where the main entrance lies -
it is all too clearl y there. 

If this does not stOp, we will 
have a set of glass and cement 
buildings glaring at each other, 

bald and bare , under the raw 
California sun . like the blind 
monstrosities of an y industrial 
"park ," because there is nothing 
else there. No trees. Is that what 
we want for thi s campus? 

Islam insult 
Editor: 

Kate Gardner 

We are writing in response to 
the blatantly racist letter by Jeff 
Hoffer that appeared in the 
October 30 issue of the Guardian. 

The racist auitude of the 
author appeared clearly from the 
beginning when, in the second 
paragraph , he made the 
ignorantly general statement that 
"there has -never been any kind 
of respect for human life in the 
Arab world ." He eve n went 
further and pointed to Islam as 
the source of "terrorism, 
blackmail, and extortion ... " Mr. 
Hoffer is obviously writing out of 
prejudices and without any 
knowledge whatsOever of Islam. 
See for y.ourself: in times of war, 
Islam's orders are that there be 
no killing of children, old 
people , 'Women, priests, civilians 
or even fighters who seek refuge 
in sacred places. Furthermore , 
there is to be no killing of 
animals (except for food 
necessity) and no destruction of 

'plantation or any economic 
resources. These are the orders 
in times of war, let alone in 
times of peace. 

As to the treatment of jews in 
Spain , we wiU first note that 
Muslims arrived the re around 
700 AD. Then why would they 
wait until 1,033 to murder 5 ,000 
jews, if their religion condoned 
it? On the contrary, the j ews met 
an atmosphere of tolerance, as 
related by Felipe T. Bemaldo d e 
QUir'os in "The Spanish jews"

the Jews collaborated in the

Visigoth s. It was then that the 
golden ~ge began fo r the Spanish 
jews .... 

By doing so, the Muslims were 
only following the directives of 
their Holy Book (the Qur'an), 
which commands: "And do not 
let the hatred of some people 
drive you away from being just; 
be just, that is closer to peity." 
And more specifically: "And do 
not argue wUh the people of the 
Book (the jews and the 
Christians) except with the best 
of manners." These directives 

were exemplified by Prophet 
Mohammad when he migrated 
from Mecca to Medina (622 
A.D.). He assured the j ewish 
community. in writing. that Islam 
not only respects their religious 
traditions and laws. but 
guarantees protection for them. 
as long as they too respect the 
Muslim community. The two 
parties went even further and 
signed a pact of mutual defense. 

Another manifestation of Mr. 
HolTer's racist approach came 
from his linkage of the word 
"assasination" to the Arabic 
language and its supposed 
implication on the Arab 
mentality. Even if we assume that 
the word "assassination" did

39¢ hamburger. 

originate in the Arabic language, 
we are still astonished to see the 
author fa llaciously and 
hypocritically infer tha t the Arabs 
have long had murd erous 
attitudes!! The words chemistry 
and alcohol also have roots in 
the Arabic language; does that 
imply that the Arabs have special 
predispositions for chemistry 
and . ironically. for alcohol? It is 
clear that Mr. Hoffer used this 
argument in a deliberately 
devious and racist manner. and 
tliat he certainly knew his 
conclusions were not logical. 

Finally. we would like to nOle 
th e amazing methodology that 
the author used in his reasoning. 
He does not provide references 

to any of his assertions. he 
rathe r bases his claims and 
d raws his conclusions from 
pe rsonal prejud ices. It does not 
take much intelligence to realize 
that in judging a religion. one 
must base himself on the 
authenticated sources. and not 
on acts performed by individuals 
or groups in the name of 
religion. 

In addition, Mr. Hoffer 
demonstrated his bad faith by 
using arguments that were 
disproved to him by several 
members of the Muslim Student 
Organization and the 
Organization of Arab Students. 
Mr. Hoffer also raised the same 
issues and used the same 

Thu rsday. Novtmber 6. 1986 5 

OPINIONS 
rhetoric when he attended a 
lecture tided "The Principles of 
justice in Islam," last spring on 
campus. He was again corrected 
very clearly and politely. Why 
then . does he keep trying to 
mislead people by preaching 
false arguments? 

In conclusion . we invite Mr. 
Hoffer to seriously reconsider not 
only his "knowledge" of Islam 
and Islamic history, but 
expecially his approach to 
debating. We hope that in future 
he wiU not produce such an 
insulting article.

pan in the development of 
UCSD's alcohol policy, This 
alcohol awareness has stemmed 
from several areas. The most 
prevalent is the aIgument that 
there needs to be more 

education in terms of alcohol 
and substance abuse. Watson 
believes UCSD·s COliC ern with 
drinking is meant [0 educate and 
"not Stop drinking by those 
under 21 or label drinking as 
'morally wrong: 

"There will always be students 
who will tl)' to get around the 
policy, either by drinking behind 
closed doors or going to off· 
campus panies: but I would hope 
students are taking responsibility 
for their actions," Watson said , 

Assistant Vice Chancellor of 
UndeIgraduate AlTairs Dr. John 
Giebink stated, "The policy is 
simply a reiteration of the State 
law," Because UCSD has now 
brought its alcohol policy up to 
the standards set by the State , 
the university and administration 
are no longer legally liable for 
on<ampus alcohol related 
incidents involving minors, 

"Anyone using alcohol would 
be hard pressed to file chaIges 
against the university," said Nick 
Aguilar of UCSD legal services, 
Because the university has clearly 
stared its position on alcohol, 
anyone violating the policy 

"There will always be 
students who will try to 
get around the policy . .. 
but I would hope 
students are taking 
responsibility for their 
actions. " 

-Joseph Watson 

would have little or no legal 
recourse , 

The only case in which action 
could be taken would be a 
situation where an official failed 
to adhere to the policy, "Unless a

university official: stated Aguilar, 
"knew about it (alcohol use) and 
failed or refused to take 
reasonable action, the policy 
protects the university." 

Organizations sponsoring off-
campus events are responsible 
for any incidents involving 
someone who consumed alcohol 
on the premises, According to 
Aguilar, "They are not agents or 
official units of the university," 
and thus take full responsibility 
for all off<ampus activities, 

"Any group dispensing alcohol 
to a minor exposes themselves to 
extensive liability: said Aguilar. 
These oIganizations include 
UCSD's Greek community, IFC 
President McCambridge 
acknowledged that 75 percent of 
the fraternity community at 
UCSD is under 21. 

Friend is aware of the legal. 
stipulations and explains that 
actions taken by the IFC and 
individual fraternities are meant 
to lessen the chance of an 
alcohol related incident. Friend 
is upset with the policy because 
he believes it is "hypOCritical to 
try to crack down on drunk 
driving without providing on-
campus activities." - IZiJ

It's winnin' time for UCSD 
Women's soccer showdown Sunday at 1 

T HE biggest game in the history of UCSD women's soccer team will 
take place Sunday at I pm on 
Warren Field when the Tritons 
face the winner of the match 
berween Methodist College of 
North Carolina and St. Mary's 
College of Minnesota, which 
takes place Saturday at I pm on 
Warren Field. 

"I want to put a plea to our 
students to come out and 
support us," said UCSD coach 
John Leaney." If we get a really 
big crowd for our game on 

Sunday, I really feel we can put 
on a great performance. The 
bigger the crowd, the bener 
chance we have of winning." 

One of the Leaney's main 
gripes about this year's regional 
is that the powers to be are 
biased toward New York area 
teams and , according to Leaney, 
whoever wins in this regional 
will hopefully go back to New 
York to show up the selection 
comminee. 

"It really bugs me that the 
people in charge are favoring 
New York and New England 

teams," said Lea ne y. "They 
should have made the teams 
from New York fight it out 
amongst [hemselves; but instead, 
they split them up . It's unfair, 
and I hope we can win to go 
back and show them we can 
play out West , too." 

Coach John Leaney is pleased 
with his team's progress this 
season. Says Leaney, "Our young 
players developed a lot quicker 
than I expected, which is a big 
reason for our success, but our 
veterans also played well 
expecially at the beginning of the 
season , which gave our young 
players a chance to gain 
confidence and experience. ~

ball in play, serve tough, and are 
a good side out team.

"It seems when we play UCSD, 
we're a different tcam," said 
Monique LaVeau. 'When we play 

t~em , we get really pumped. We 
know UC D has a good 
reputation, and their team looks 
awesome to us, but whf'n we 
play them, we do everything well. 
It's the one match we're looking 
forward to this weekend . 

The other teams in the 
tourney should not be shunned, 
either. ·We've had our problems 
with San Bernardino," said 
Dannevik, "and they are quite 
capable of upsening anybody. 
They don't spike very much and 
they playa much slower paced 
game. They can definitely make 
it to the final four of our 
region." u:a 

Surf shreds 
The UCSD Surf Team 

shredded the breakers up 
Ventura way last weekend in the 
first of five competitions in the 
National Scholastic Surfing 
Association college team season 
and placed fifth out of sixteen 
schools. 

"Naturally, we should have 
done bener," said Mike Glevy. 
"But fifth out of 16 isn't bad." 

Individual achievements 
included a fifth place finish by 
Scott Bass in the men's stand'up 
division , Isabelle Tihany as a 
women's finalist, Bob Schiff as a 
kneeboard finalist, and Scott 
Campbell with first place honors 
in the bodyboard division. ~

Budman's Waterpolo Outlook 
Steppmg out of my favorite on-campus 

waterIng hole the other mght I heard all kmds 
of screammg and yelling trom the N,ttatonum. I 
paused for a Sf ond to think what pOSSIbly 
might be the nature of all the late night 
commotion. I thought all the aquatic action on 
campus had been moved to Canyonvlcw 
Waterpolo guru Denny Harper is always talking 
aboul the action. the nOise. the crowds and the 
excitement that hiS program has brought to the 
Canyonvlew pool. Had Denny moved back to 
the Na tatonum, and cuillvated an even larger. 
more boistcrous crowd' My cunOSlty peaked. I 
had to stroll over and takt' a look. With one 
sharp whistle my trusty colleague Spuds 
M Kinzey was at my ' Ide We walked past the 
hump, and betwecn the gyms. As we gOt closer 
we heard a referee's whistle. Then. It hit me. 
How could I be ~o dumb? Of course, lt was I.M. 
Intenube Waterpolo. -

The crowds were cheering on their favorue 
teams hke It was Ihe Superbowl. Who would 
kave guessed they were playmg for bragglllg 
rights around the dorms, or In the pub? Aftcr 
the game. I Just hall to find Out more about what 
turll5 nonnal college tudents Into polo Junkies 
that play games as late as 1230 am One of the 
players I've seen OUt there for years was drymg 
off after thc game and had thiS to say about hiS 
dcvollon . "It's easy to get hooked, 'cause anyone 
can play. and it's real easy to learn. Heck. there's 
only one other Ihmg I'd rather do at thiS llmcof 
the night " I didn't thmk he was gomg to say 
tudy. so I moved on. I turned around and 

Spuds was makmg a move on an unsuspectmg 
freshman. It looked hke It was gomg 10 be 
another one of those nights for puds, but I was 
rescued. The lifeguard reaILzed what was gomg 
on and was all ovcr puds ILkc a cheap SUit. he 
explained. "No dogs arc ,dlowed in the pool " 
Spuds gave henhat sheepish lookofhl~hopmg 
he could Slick around a while longer and do 
some more networking, but II was to no avail 
We got the thumb, and hit the road. I figured I'd 
take a look at this vear's teams to sec who was 
Winning, dnd wh~ needed some more sWim 
lessons I 

anyone's guess J~ to who Will emerge on lOp 01 
the heap Several veleran squads have shown 
plenty oftalenr m le.lgue p!J) thus far. Madonna 
Maxwell is back With Ihe "Wet Dreamers" 
whIch once ag3m makes them a force to be 
reckoned with . The " pcnninators" and "Team 
Squckh" will battle 10nlght for the Arlene 
League ChampIOnship. "Gayle's Whales" has 
romped through Ihc Bernice League averagmg 
14 goals each outing. ThiS diviSion IS a real toSS-
up 

puds and I were talking the other day and 
we agreed that the A DiVISion of Imertube 
Water polo prOVided some of the best laughs 
and fiercest action III all the 1M's. Most of the 
leams arc fir~1 timers Some of the gals even 
wear 2 pIceI' swun SUitS. well .It least for Ihe first 
half of their first game Spuds JUSt loves 
spreadmg those slones aboul the gals not bemg 
able 10 wear T-shirts into the pool because the 
hnt clogs the filter. They always fall for it So far, 
"MyopiC Misfits." "ZB Tubes ... .. Team Kaos." and 
"K Wikecs" appear to be nsmg above 
medIOcrity. I think expenence may prove to be 
the deCiding factor In Ihi> league. What did you 
say puds, there IS no expenence I n thiS 
diVISion. Oh well 

In the women s race, Karen Prather ha ' been 
the leader as long ,IS Mati "9 years" Adams can 
remember Bu! nOl thiS year. Move over Karen. 
Make room for Jennifer "needs to gam some 
weight" Cutler and Evy Acousta. These ladles 
can really pl.IY. It I[ weren't lor these tWO, 
Captain Dick and hiS Seamen .lnd Big Sticks 
and Little ChICks would probably be 0-3. A 
speCIal recognition b tn order for Jani e Lltvtn 
and Kathy Harry of Mr and Mrs. I'll ksteln . 
These two ladies lead theIr learn tn upsetting 
the previously unbeaten, high powered "Htgh 
PhI"!1 It was the 1980 Winter Olympics all over 
again. Remember U A vs USSR' Congrats!!! 

Floor Hockey/Scoring Update 
The AM DIVISIon IS close. The hanges in 

the rules and Ihe mcrcascs in competitiveness 
of thIS years league made goal scoring much 
more dIfficult. Steve "getting 100 old" Kent leads 
WIth 7 goals. Look out for Mike Peterson, Dan "[ 
can'l find a good tcam to play for" Hirsher, and 
Rich Troop. They have scored 5 goals each. 

In AA, Seott Zafren leads with 16 goals in 
three games. He had a trememdous elfon with 7

Collecting a following 
The United Kingdom has 

Bono, the United States has 
Springsteen, and Australia has 
Mark Seymour. Mark 
Seymour??? Hunters & 
Collectors, the 'sextet from 
down under, is fronted by 
lyricist, lead singer, and 
guitarist Seymour, Whether 
live or on album. he can 
captivate an audience the way 
very few artists are able to do. 

Hunters &. Collectors, 
formed in 1980, recently went 
th 'ough some personnel 
ch .. nges along with an 
overhaul of their sound 
before releasing ~eir fourth 
album Human Frail", on 
I.R.S. Records, Added to the 
band is a horn section which 
include trombone, trumpet, 
and , French horn. Unique 
horn arrangements, along 
with a deep bass beat that is 
often absent of a guitar, blend 
together for a very original, 
yet enjoyable, sound. 

Human Frailty offers more 
than just intriguing music; it 
also includes personal lyrics 
wh ich drummer Doug 
Falconer said were capable of 
"speaking to people both 
collectively and as individu-
als," However, Falconer 
denies any similarity to U2: 
"We're much more personal; 
we're not trying to write 
anthems like they do," 
Anthems or not, the lyrics 
often deal with "rough 
t ime s" , suc h as when 

by mark pinku8 
Seymour was having 
problems with his girlfiend. 
Even so, they can be 
considered more than just 
personal feelings about his 
relationship and can be 
universally understood. 

" Throw , Your Arms 
Around Me," the first single 
to be released from the album 
is already a hit in their 
homeland and is beginning to 
be heard here. A remixed 
twelve inch dance single has 
been made for this song; it is 
one of the two best songs on 
the album and it is definitely 
the most commercial track. "I 
will squeete the life out of )'QU; 
)IOU will make me laugh and 
make me cry and we will neuer 
forget it. You will make me call 
)'OUT name and shout it to t~e blue 
summer sky" is just an sample 
of how this love song 
combines peculiar lyrics with 
a voice that is filled with 
passion and hope. 

"This Morning," which 
closes off the album, displays 
Seymour at his best. The song 
begins with a slow, 
apocalyptic sound which 
works up to a fr enzy; 
nevertheless, they primarily 
show off their musical talents 
with the sudden slow 
conclusion in which everyone 
joins in on the background 
vocals. This song is a favorite 
o f their live audiences and it is 
usually performed at the 
encore. Seymour hangs on the 

mike belting out the lyrics 
while the audience repeats the 
lines with a fervor rarely 
found in clubs. 

The only specific social 
comment on the album can be 
found in "Is There Anybody 
In There?" The song,which 
bears some resemblance to 
how the Clash might sound 
with horns , has the whole 
band repeating the lines, 
" Don't leave it uncovered, 
cover it over" as it speaks out 
against Australian television. 
This powerful tune discusses 
how the United States send 
American newscasts over to 
Australia. which the band 
considers to be very biased 
infonnation. The title of the 
song reveals that Seymour 
wonders if anything or 
anybody cares about what 
" the box" is showing, 

The album title, Human 
Frailty, reveals how this is an 
emotional band; but see them 
live and the true intensity of 
Hunters &. Collectors is 
exposed. 

The band. which perform-
ed a half a dozen shows in 
California earlier this month, 
ha,s perfected its live sound 
with the combination of tight 
jams and clear vocals and it 
makes for an amazing 
performance. This is one band 
whose album and concerts 
show no frailty - Hunters & 
Collectors should not be 
overlooked.

2 Hiatus November 6. 1986 

Nicaragua today 
by nonie ganakis 

Guerilla warfare invades 
the central American jungle. 
In the city, citizens as well as 
soldiers run from scattered 
gun shots, evading the lifeless 
bodies that lay at their feet. 
This is the visual image that 
the American media has given 
Nicaragua. 

Carlos Pinedo, a local 
photographer and San Diego 
City College student, has 
managed to avoid these 
lingering stereotypes in his 
premiering photo exhibit 
'Images of Daily Life in 
T oday's Nicaragua." Rather 
than to shock the observer, 
Pinedo's photos senSitively 
illustrated the social, 
economic and political 
instability that has become a 
part of everyday life for 
Nicaragua's people. 

"Originally I went down 
there (Nicaragua) to find out 
what was really happening for 

myself," Pinedo said . "And 
what I found out was thata lot 
of what I read and heard by 
the media were lies." 

Pinedo's use of titles and his 
categorizing of certain photos 
are at times repetetive and 
uneffective; however, these 
minor shortcomings aid the 
crisp black and white 
landscapes and faces to create 
a view of the Nicaraguan 
people that is both objective 
and personal. 

"It's hard for Americans to 
understand what's going on," 
Pinedo said. " They see 
Nicaragua through American 
eyes and they see only right 
and wrong, the contras and 
the Sandinistas." 

"Images of Daily Life in 
Today's Daily Life in Today's 
Nicaragua II is open to the 
public through November 10. 
It is free of charge and located 
in Mandeville's East Room.

The Tokyo String Quartet 
begins the UCSD 1986-87 
Chamber Music Series on 
Saturday, November 15 at 8 
pm in the Mandeville 
Auditorium. The Quartet, 
now in its 16th year, has 
played two European/ Asian 
tours, including six concerts 
in Paris. They have also 
performed in Finland, Japan, 
and other Eastern countries. 

The well-trained ensemble 
members have produced 
admirable recorded works, 
including the Haydn Quartet 
in G Major, Opus 76, No. I, 
which won the Grand Prix du 
Disque de Montreaux. The 
Quartet has also won the Best 
Chamber Music Recording of 
the Year Award from Stereo 
Review and Gramaphone, as 
well as three Grammy 
nominations. 

Each member of the Tokyo 
String Quartet is highly 
skilled. Peter Oundjian began 
playing the violin at the age of 
six in London, studied with 
Itzhak Perlman, and in 1980 
won first prize in the 
International Violin Compet-
ition in Chile. 

Kazuhide Isomura, the 
violist, has served as the 
assistant concertmaster of the 
Nashville Symphony. 

Cellist Sadao Harada, a 
founding member of the 
Tokyo String Quartet along 
with Isomura, graduated from 
the Toho Academy. He won 
First Prize at the prestigious 
Mainichi Music Concourse 
and has served as Arst cellist 
for both the Tokyo and 
Nashville Symphonies before 
deciding to pursue a career in 
chamber music. 

All four musicians studied 
at the Julliard Academy. 

The November 15 program 
will include the Haydn 
Quartet in C Major, Opus 74, 
No.1; the Mendelssohn

Midmght is bad; much to the 
contrary, it is a lovingly 
crafted, auteur vision; 
however, in this age of glitzy 
Hollywood packaging, it 
might not catch on. But there 
is every reason for those 
seeking quality, stimulating 
entertainment to seek it out 
and enjoy it, not for what it 
isn't (fast paced or exciting) 
but for what it so grandly is. 

According to the film's 
credits, it is inspired by 
incidents in the lives of 
Francis Paudras and Bud 
Powell. it is set in the Paris of 
1959, a haven for jazz 
musicians from the United 
States who went unappreci-
ated in their homeland. 

In the film, sax tenor Dale 
Turner (Dexter Gordon) 
packs up and leaves New York 
with a group of musicians and 
heads for France. One rainy 
evening, he meets Francis 
(Francois Cluzet), who has 
been a lifelong admirer of 
Dale's music. A friendship 
strikes up between the two, 
and it is through this unlikely 
pairing that Tavernier's film 
(co-written by David Rayfiel) 
shows how the power of 
music can move men and 
change lives. Although jazz is 
only a backdrop, there is 
enough quality music in the 
'film tq keep admirers happy. 

Tavernier is a true master of 
cinema. His last effort, A 
Sunday in the Country, is proof 
of that. It would appear 
difficult to top that almost 
perfect film, but Tavernier has 
done it with Round Midnight. 

Rounding 
up the 

beat 

great Dexter Gordon 
staTS as Dale T umer. 

Not only does Round Midnight 
contain exquisite perfor-
mances, a lot of great music 
and a touching story, but it is 
also blessed with the amazing 
camera work of Bruno de 
Keyzer. At times, expect to be 
absolutely stunned when 
seeing the kinds of 
unobtrusive tricks de Keyzer 
and Tavernier perform with 
the camera. 

But there are some 
problems with Round 
Midnight, the chief of which is 
the film's pacing. It is 
sometimes meticulously, 
almost excruciatingly slow. It 
will be difficult for many to 
overcome the film's length 
and speed. Those who do will 
be in for a surprise; if nothing 
else, Round, Midnight rings 
agonizingly and heartbreak-
ingly true. 

It is only a plus that th~s 
may be one of the finest films 
about music and musicians 
ever made. 

Round Midnight opens 
tomorrow at the Pacific 
Grossmont and Mann's UTC 
theatres. 

The Beat Rodeo will be bringing their blend of country, 
pop and rock 'n' roll to the Triton Pub at noon on 
Tuesday, November 11. The band's upcoming 
performance marks the beginning of the west coast leg of 
the tour to promote their new album Home in the Heart of 
the Beat. This is their second album, and with this one they 
are finally receiving some public recognition in addition 
to critical acclaim. 

Lead vocalist, guitarist, harmonica player, and 
songwriter Steve Almaas from Minnesota formed the 
band bade in 1982 with lead guitarist Bill Schunk from 
New York. Country styled ballads like "Everything I'm 
Not" and "While We're Apart" reveal the midwestern 
attitude, while a straight pop tune like "In the 
Summertime" reveals the big city type of sound. 
Keyboards and synthesizers, along with saxophone on two 
songs, give the band a complete sound with a strong back 
beat. This should be the last time Beat Rodeo plays in such 
an intimate place, so do not miss them.
