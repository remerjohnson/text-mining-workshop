By Vincent Gragnanl 
Senior Staff Writer 

A keynote speech, faculty presentations and 
a picnic welcomed alumni back to campus this 
Saturday as UCSD celebrated its third annual 
Homecoming. 

UCSD Chancellor Robert Dyne addressed 
the event 's attendees in the Pri ce Center 
Ball room before introducing the keynote 
speaker. Dynes said that UCSD is a growing 
economic force in San Diego. 

"We are the sewnd largest employer in San 
Diego County," Dynes said . "We create 50,000 
local jobs and ' 63,000 jobs outside the local 
area." 

Dynes also said that the quality of under-
graduate education is improvi ng at UCSD. 

"In U.S. ews and World Report, we were 
ranked sixth in the nation for public universi-
ties," Dynes said. "The overall caliber of the 
students continues to ri se." 

"UCSD is one of the finest research univer-
ities in the country, and I sec no reason why 

this won' t become an even finer uni vers ity in 
the future," he added. 

Dynes then introdul:ed the keynote speaker, 
Irwi n Jacobs. a former UCSD faculty member 
as well as founder and CEO of Quaicomm Inc.

UCSD Music Professors Win 
ASCAP Awards 

For the second time in three years , Bertram 
Turetzky and Rand Steiger, two UCSD professors of 
music, have been selected as recipients of American 
Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers 
(ASCAP) Awards. 

The 1998-99 ASCAP Awards were granted by an 
independent panel of music educators, directors and 
performers to a select group of musicians from 
throughout the country. The annual awards are based 
upon two criteria: the value of each writer's catalog of 
original compositions and the recent performances of 
those works. 

Turetzky is a solo performer on the contrabass. He 
has recorded more than 160 new works, making him 
the most recorded contrabass soloist in America. 

Turetzky plays in more than 100 concerts annually 
for the Young Audience/Education in the Schools pro-
gram and more than 50 concerts annually for the 
Gluck Chamber Music Conce,t Series at Scripps 
Clinic's Green Hospital. He performs jazz, a tradition-
al classical repertoire and contemporary mUSIC of al l 
types , including avant-garde. 

Steiger has composed for theater, dance, film , 
video and the concert hall. He has performed at fes-
tivals in Aspen, Berlin and Amsterdam, and in ensem-
bles such as the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra 
and the New York New Music Ensemble. 

He has designed electronic music studios, developed 
software for a computer music system and co-founded 
the Center for Contemporary Music of Costa Rica, which 
is Central America ' s first computer music center. 

A UCSD faculty member since 1988, Steiger has 
taught courses in composition , conducting, percus· 
sion and computer music, and regularly conducts 
SONOR, the university's contemporary music ensem-
ble. He received his M.F.A. from the California 
Institute of the Arts .

of a bet agreed upon by Chance llor 
Robert Dynes and A.S. President 
Joe L eventhal several weeks ago. 

Dynes will host a barbecue for 
UCSD on Library Walk because 
Leventhal IInished before Dynes in 
tbe race. 

" Sinc.:e I won. Chancellor Dynes

with the A.S . on Library Walk." 
Leventhal said. 

" I f Chancellor Dynes had beat 
Ille, I would have had to wash his 
car every week for a month . But he 
didn ' t tell me that he had two c.:ars. 
and I didn ' t tell him that I was on 
the UCSD c.:ross c.:ountry team last 
year. So we' re hoth even," he 
added. 

The run attracted over 1,000 
pa rtic.:ipant ~, Brian Daly, assoc.:iate 
direc tor of development for student 
affairs. said. 

Daly said tlut 300 more partici -
pants registered for the race than 
last year. He attributed this increase 
to greater student parti cipation. 

Dynes and community member 
Charlie Robins, who was the event 
chair, matc.:hed up to $40.000 in 
corporate and individual sponsor-

ships. Dynes donated 5 for eadl 
parti l:ipant that signed up and 
anuther 5 for eac.:h partic.:ipant that 
heat him in the race. M oney was 
al so rai sed through registration 
fces. which were $5 for students. 
$6 for non-students and $10 for all 
partic.:ipants on the day of the event. 

Jim Stephens. who finished the 
race first with a time of 16:02. said 
that the rac.:e was easy for him and 
that winning was satisfying . 

"Thi s is an old thing for me. 
I' ve run it a few years already." he 
said . "There was no difficulty on 
the course. hut the sati sfying thing 
wa ' running again 't UCSD cross 
country graduates. 

" I want to support and keep 
supporting the UC D athletic cum-
munity .... he added. 

Many faculty members and stu-
dent~ also participated in the event. 
Jd"f Hay, a professor for Making of 
the M odem World, aid the run was 
challengi ng. 

"The course wasn't too bad. just 
a lot of up. and downs. And the last 
hi II was definitely a challenge," he 
said. " But it was all right consider-
ing it was a l:ross coumry course." 

Money was raised frolll the 
event primaril y through pri va te 
sponsorship, which was c.: atego-
ri zed mto three tiers - Olympian 
Sponsors, Marathon Sponsors and 
Community Spon~ors . 

Smith 's Ict:lure showcased 
some of her prev ious works . As 
SlI1ith showed slides of her art 
piel:es, she said that her inll!rcst in 
the human body was partially 
sparked by her father's death. 

She also said that in many of 
her sl:ulptures. the ligure is made 
from a cast of a person so that it is 
real and not her "own subjective 
version of a body." 

Toni Day. a member of the San 
Diego l:ommunity attending the 
lecture , sa id that she found the 
Ict: llIre informative. 

" IThe lecture I gave insight as 
to where ISmith] was l:oming 
from in order to c.:rc,lIe art," Day 
said. 

mith said that the meanings 
she wants others to find in 
Standing arc "just their own expe-
riences." 

Beebe said that the sculpture is 
a great addition to the school's art 
collection. 

"[It I adds another dimension to

affordable and friendly on-line services, but they're working with a faulty system 
By Kathryn Swisher 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Okay, I'll be the first to admit it. I 
know nothing about computers other than 
the bare minimum necessary to survive. 
Unfortunately, once outside the realm of 
Netscape and Microsoft Otlice, there is a 
feeling of inadequacy in performing tasks 
that others consider simple and straight-
forward . 

For instance, I find "downloading" elu-
sive. This i . somewhat embarrassing as I 
have been led to believe that downloading 
everything from "South Park" videos to 
the latest software upgrades can be per-
formed eas ily by preschool children. 

Now, I can do without watching videos 
and listening to music on my computer. I 
have accepted the fact that many students 
are not exactly cresting the waves of new 
technology, but rather treading computer 
semi-literate waters. However, I have 
recently been raced with the daunting task 
of confi guring my computer for 
ACS/ etwork Operations dial-in modem 
service and, suddenl y, I seem to be in over 
my head. 

During the lirst few weeks of freshmt;n 
year, .:very day opened an exciting new 
chapter in my attempt tu (,o nligure my 
computer to wurk with the U SD network 
via ctl](:met. I installed the network soft-
ware package, and though I did not imme-
diately have e-mail or access to the inter-
net, I felt confiJent that thi s problem 
would soon be remedied. 

Euch day [ would sit at my desk with 
my booklet of . nstructions. At the end of 
each day, with an ominous "'droplet" 

sound, the words became increasingly 
familiar : "Netscape failed to make a net-
work socket connection." AUempts to con-
tact Network Operations proved futile, as 
every other freshmen was having the same 
problem. 

The only information from Network 
Operations at the time was the optimistic 
probability that because my roommate's

are very clear, with a 
limited amount of scary 
computer terms .•• 
computer was also failing to make any 
kind of "socket connection." the ethernet 
box in our room W,lS faulty. Not com-
pletely reassured, I continued my quest 
for e-mail. A random phone ca ll to the 
UCSD Booksture Computer Ce nter 
infornled which was the proper -section of 
the instructi on booklet to look to for my 
particu lar computer's conliguration. 

Thus, during the lir~ t week of the quar-
ter, [ vis ited the App lied Physics & 
Mathematics building where Academic 

ol1lputer 'ervices is housed, with some 
degree of trepidation. 

Arter receiv ing more wriHen instruc-
tions, I asked if the contigurati on process 
would be relatively easy - my ex peri -
ences in the dorm first year still fresh in 
my mind. I was assured that I simply had 
to fo llow the in 'tructions on the handout 
(Iumous last words!). Another person in 
line (you know who you are) proceeded to 
announce that he would on ly require the 

activation of an account with ACS, as he 
had already configured his computer, sans 
instructions. 

There is yet to be any sort of dial-in 
action involving my computer. However, I 
have found ACSlNetwork Ops helpful in 
my individual situation. Overall , it is an 
excellent resource for anyone using the 
UCSD network (though my computer still 
doesn' t work properly). 

Despite my own past and present prob-
lems, I have found that ACS/ et wo rk Ops 
provides affordable and comprehensive 
network se rvice and internel access to 
those who choose to use the UCS D net-
work rather th an other internet Servers 
such as America Online. Commercial ser-
vices ca n be slower and cause more prob-
lems for the user than ACS/Network Ops.

setup of both P and Mac intosh ethernet 
and modem services see m to be designed 
for students like myself. who arc intimi-
dated. to say the leas!. by messing around 
with things on their computers oth.:r than 
e-mai l and Microsoft Word. 

The instruction sheets are very dear, 
with a limit d amount of scary computer 
terms that seem to Ii II the rages of uther 
manuals . Another great feature of these 
dir,:clions arc the lillie pictures of what 
the windows on the comput 'r an: sup-
posed look like. Even I have been able to 
follow the steps in the confi guration of my 
own computer, which is why its fai lure to 
work remai ns a mystery.

fumble the programming ball unless somebody 
comes to the rescue. 

Though, the hands that controlled our concerts 
and dances a week ago were not any beller. Juan , 
with a lack or A.S. Council experience and no 
experience with the music industry, was elec ted 
spring quart er with the large helping hand of the 
Students First! slate. 

U nquali tied ror the position, her appointment 
can only be chalked up to the weight pulled by the 
slate under which she ran. 

Her Oct. 19 resignation - less than four weeks 
into rail quarter - tells us that she was under-qual-
ified ror the office and that political slates prevent 
an election process from dctennining the best per-
son ror the job. 

We told you so. 
A Guardian evaluation of the candidates prior 

to spring's elections determined that Juan had too 
little experience with both AS and with the music 
industry to be granted an endorsement for the 
position. Both knowledge of the workings of A.S. 
and savvy within the unfriendly music industry 
are vital elements to make a qualified 
Commiss ioner of Programm i ng. Juan had neither 
of these elements. 

A leller from Juan expressed her fea r tha t other 
com mitments would affect her performance as 
Commi ssioner of Programming. She said it would 
not be rair to pu sh A.S. down lower on li st of pri -
orities. She also expressed concern that her level 
of excitement for A.S . was not as high as others in 
her office. Juan should be applauded for this h n-
esty and for acting in the best intere t of the A.S. 
Council and of the students of UCSD. 

Howevcr, an important department of UCS D 
student government is lert in shamb les.

One of the greatest phenomena 
ever to take place in San Diego has 
passed. A ew York Yankees pen-

Bay Bridge to signal the end of a 
great October for San Diego and its 
baseball fans. 

For the past few weeks th is 
so metimes-unfriendl y town has 
looked like a genuine community, 
with smiling faces and small talk 
and something we all have in co rn-
man: the San Diego Padres. 

Arguably the best team in the 
franchise's hi story, Gwy nn, Brown.

Painted faces , honking cars and

of unity.

sense of unit y that seemed to come 
along with the Padres ational

Kirk Matsuzaki, "The chancellor 
was there, and it was a chance to 
let him know how students of 
color feel. " 

Other students said that they 
felt the rally also brought forth 
the discussion of other issues, 

Marshall junior Michelle 
Magalong, who is an ethnic stud-
ies and urban studies and plan-
ning double major, said she felt 
that diversity edtlcation - spcci r-
ically, in the ethnic studies 
department - is threatened at 
UCSD and at UC Berkeley. 

She said she believes the uni -

versity must make an effort to 
encourage diversity on (;ampus to 
attract students from underrepre-
scnted racial minority groups, 

"People of color don't know 
where they fit. Some will not 
even apply," Magalong said. "The 
whole history [of di versity on 
campusl has a been a strugg le. 
And without encouraging stu-
dents of different races, the [stu-

. dent] population can't be 
diverse." 

Muir sophomore Shawbong 
Fok, who is also an ethnic studie 
major, said that he believes multi -
cultural education is needed for 
American society. 

"Diversity is essential to civi-
I ization," Fok said, "It is commu-
nicating and interlocking differ-
ences, Diversity smoothes out 
tension between classes, sexua li -
ties , races. and ideologies." 

At UC Davis, over 700 stu-
dents gathered to protest the event 
in front of their Davis Quad on 
Wednesday for a two-and-a-half 
hour demonstration. Many facul -

1972 . when hc left to t:o- found a 
company entitled Linkabit. In 
1985 , Jacobs founded Quakomm. 
a company that now cmploys 
11,000 wo rkers. Jac bs recently 
donated $15 million to the CSD 
School of Engineering. 

Dynes said that hi s L: hoicc of 
hcobs as the Homecoming 
keynote speaker was an easy one. 

"He's a former faculty member, a 
good friend of the university and the 
story of how the entrepreneurial spir-
it has evolved is a nice story," Dynes 
said. " It shows how ideas from 
UCSD can spin out into success." 

Jacobs said that newer, smaller 
computer chips are expanding pos-
sibi lities in personal ce llular com-
munications . 

Jacobs also said that new 
phones are able to indude phone 
directories, a voice-recognition 
system and mini Internet browsers. 

Jacobs added that Qualcomm is 
working in all parts of the world. 

"You can 't have a local commu-
nications company," Jllcobs said. 
"It has to be global. Les developed 
and developing countri es are mov-
ing ahead with wireless communi-
cations." 

Jacobs later said that there is an 
important link between Qualcomm 
and UCSD, 

"You need well-trained people 
trained locally," he said , "It 's very 
important to have a first-rate uni-
versi ty in the ne ighborhood." 

Jacobs al so s;lid that many 

Quulcomm employees who were 
educated elsewhere can use UCSD 
to pursue graduate education. 

Following Jacobs ' speech, 
CSD faculty members gave pre-

sentations in Center Hall. 
Among the presentat ions was a 

poetry reading katuring UCSD 
poets Rae Armantrout , Michael 
Davidson. Quincy Troupe, Stephen 
Cope and Wai Lim Wip. 

Duvidson. who introduced the 
pocts, read some of his own works 
including recent poems entitled 
"Mixed Aryan" and "The Second 
City," 

Davidson said that although 
there was a time limit. he felt that 
people had a chance to experience 
a good variety of poetry. 

"It 's hard to do much in an 
hour," Davidson said. "But I think 
they got a good sample of what we 
have here." 

In another faculty presentation, 
Marshall College Provost Cecil 
Lytle played works from 
Beethoven and Chopin, He also 
spoke about the creative process 
that goes into composing classical 
music, 

"We shouldn't think that this 
music somehow dropped out of 
heaven," Lytle said. "It was the 
product of a great deal of thought 
and intent." 

Lytle said that Chopin's music, 
which was improvisational, dif-
fered greatly from the composi-
tions of Beethoven. 

"Chopin's crea tive thought 
process ties him more to 20th cen-
tury American music than to 18th 
century European music," Lytle 
said. "His process is more like that 
of an improviser." 

Lytle later said he thought that

the Homecoming celebration ia a 
unique event. 

"Thi is one of the fun events of 
the year for me," he said. "It gives 
me a chance to present the campus 
in a way they don't normally see 
it. .. 

Other faculty presenters dis-
cus cd topics such a ' the future of 
China, genetic engineering and the 
e lectronic future of thc UCSD 
libraries. 

Dynes said that while he was 
pleased with this year 's 
Homecoming, he hopes to see the 
event expand in the future . 

"I look forward to it growi ng," 
Dynes said, "We don't have a foot -
ball team to bring people back but 
more and more alumni are engag-
ing in support," 

Director of Alumni Relations 
Bernie Farrow said she thought the 
day was a success. 

"The people here are having a 
really good time," Farrow said. 
")' m just disappointed more people 
aren ' t taking advantage of it." 

In an effort to get more atten-
dees in the future, Farrow said th,lt 
she is looking into possible 
changes in the Homecoming ce le-
bration. 

"Our plan is to rethink the tim-
ing during the year," Farrow said, 
"Also we may focus on smaller 
cluster groups such as student orga-
nization reunions." 

Alumni Relations Manager of 
Constituent Programs Annamarie 
Bezzerides said that many former 
UCSD athletes returned for the cel-
ebration, 

"Despite the fact that we don ' t 
have a football team, the return of

New Law Permits ·Disclosure to Parents ALUMNI: Picnic also held on 
RIMAe field ACT: President Clinton signs the reauthorization of Higher Education Act, which ha a provision to 

allow universities to notify parent of a tudent 's alcohol and drug violations Continued from page 9 
dous," Bezzerides said . 

By Sally Williamson 
The Stanford Daily (Stanford U.) 

STANFORD, Calif. - On 
Oct. 7, a bill passed by Congress 
was signed by Pres ident Clinton, 
giving universities the authority 
to n tify parents of a student 's 
alcohol and drug violati ons. 

President Clinton ~ i gned the 
reauthorization of the Hi gher 
Education Act, a bill that primari-
ly focuses on the reduction of 
interest rate ' for federal college 
loans but also contains a measure 
on parental notification. 

Previous federal law prohibit -
ed universities from di sc los ing 
records of student s above 18 
years of age, preventing schoo ls 
from notifying parents of a stu -
dent 's drug and alcohol use. 
However, after a string of fi ve 
alcohol-related deaths las t year 
on Virginia campuses, the bill to 
di sclose the subMance abu,e of 
students under 21 but over 18 wa, 
rccommendcd to ongrcS!> in 
Jul y. 

The hill , signed within weeks 
of alcohol-related deaths or 
severe injuries at Rutgers 
Univer, it y, thc niver, ity of 
Michigan and at Stanford, (;()uld 
greatl y affect the alcohol and 
drug poli cies of uni vcrs iti es 
nationwidc. 

James Muntoya, Stanford vice 
provost for student affairs, di d not 
, peci fy how the new Icgi, lati n 

l\farshall 

might directl y affect Stanfo rd 
policy. 

According to Montoya, it is 
important to mai ntain communi -
cation with both parent and stu -
dent, without sacrifi cing the stu -
dent's independence. 

"For the most part , Stanford 
students act responsibly, and we 
va lue that students fun ction as 
adults." he sa id . "but the 
Uni versity has the responsihility 
to he in touch with the student 's 
famil y with extreme situations," 
he said. 

As for the future, Montoya 
said that in light of the current 
issues, Stanford's al cohol policy 
will need "fine-tuning." 

"I uo not see dramatic I.: h ange~ 
in the future," Montoya sa id . 
"Instead , it should be used as a 
ca talyst for discuss ion" hetween 
the ni versity and the ASS . 

A\.:l.:o rding to Jane Ca marillo. 
head of the Office of Re~ i ucnti al 
Education. current Stanford po li -
cy on alcohol and drugs is guided 
by Ca lifornia state la w and the

"It assumes the par-
ents have control 
over students' lives 
when a lot of 18-
year-olds have more 
Independence. It 
sets a standard for 
young people to be 
under their parents' 
rules past the. age 
of 18." 

- Shannon Frank 
Stanford junior 

or resident fell ows enforce the 
alcohol policy. All dec isions 
regarding alcohol enforcement 
are left to the Stanford Polke 
Department. 

However, if a , tudent violates 
thc law. he or ~ he abo vio lates the 
Fundamental tandard, ostensibly 
gtving the Universi ty the power 
to nOli fy parents in all ca,e, of 
violati on, . 

Some students believe that if 
universi ties have the power to 
notify parents of thei r alcohol 
u,e, one of the most crucial 
a, pec ts of co llege - indepen-
dence - wi ll be invaded. 

Advocates of the hi II , howev-
er. argue that many parcnl!> arc 
unaware of their chi ldren·s alco-

hoI or drug abuse, and therefore 
I.:an do nothing to help them. In a 
sta tement to the press. Sen. John 
Warner (R-Va.) stated that per-
sonal freedom must sometimes 
ha ve exceptions. 

Incident s of alcohol abuse 
"not onl y jeopardi ze the health of 
the person who co nsumes too 
much akohol, but that indi vidu al 
in turn can do harm to others. 
Wh y shouldn ' t a parent be 
brought inT 

Rep. Anna Esh o. a Democrat 
who e district inc.:ludes Stanford, 
agrees with this provision in the 
bill: ''This i a big issue in the 
country, and this bill is a small, 
but could be a rather import ant , 
step," she said . 

Some students noted that not 
all student -parent relationship 
are the same. " It assumes the par-
ent s have cont ro l over students' 
lives when a lot of I H-ye,lr-olds 
have mo re independence." sa id 
jun io r Shannon Fra nk. "It sets a 
standard for young peop le to be 
under their parents' ru les past the 
"ge of 18." 

Montoya ~a id that college is a 
time of growth and inde pen-
dence, but poi nted out tha I the 
college yca r~, especia ll y fres h-
ma n year, arc a time or transi tion. 
" II is importa nt we do all that we 
call to help , tudents develop a 
healthy standard of living:' he 
said. 

Bezzerides also sa id that 
Jacobs' keynote speech was one of 
the day ' highlight s. 

"UCSD research has spun off so 
many companies," Bezzeride said . 
"The cutting-edge nature of UCSD 
was resonated with both alumni 
and parents. We had a full house for 
the keynote speaker." 

An all-campus picnic was held 
on the RIMAC fi eld for 
Homecoming attendees. It included 
~ od and li ve entertainment by the 
local band, Big Time Operator.

"As LONG As WE 
BOTH SHALL LIVE" 

For riche~ and for poore~ in sickness and in health, 
during midterms or finals week, some college students 

take the plunge into a lifetime of wedded bliss, 
This is one studenfs account of her decision 

to get married, and get her degree, at the same time, 

STORY BY MEGAN SMITH , 
SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

FEATURES 13 

few years ago, if omeone had told me 
that I would be married before my fourth year 
at UCS D, I would not have beli eved her. I 
might have believed that during my years as a 
student I would find the person I wanted to 
marry, but I would still have expected to gradu-
ate first , eSlablish a career and become linan-
cia ll y stable before I even thoughl about getting 
married to him. That was j ust the way it went, 
or so 1 thought. 
The aeglnnlng 

My husband, Mark, and I lived next door to 
each other in the Warren apartments our second 
year at UCSD (that would be the '96-'97 school 
year). We had not planned to live that way. In 
fact, my roommates and [ wanted a completely 
di fferent localion for Ihe apartment than we 
ended up getting. Fale, though, had Mark and I 
living nex t door to each other and we started 
dating about halfway through Ihat year. 

By the following summer, we knew we were 
going to get married eventually. No matter how 
cheesy it sounds or how often you hear people 
say it, it is absolutely true; When you find the 
person you want to spend the rest of you life 
wi th, you just know. 

It is like little kids who go over to a fricnds 
house to play. When their mom comes to take ' 
Ihem home, the kids would cry and whine 
because they never wanled to stop havi ng fun 
with their best friends . That is what it is like 
when you know, The two of you are best friends 
and you never want to have to leave him and 
stop playing to go home. 

Mark and I determined that during Ihe sum-
mer or 1998 we would become engaged and 
that we would get married the fo llowing sum-
mer after we graduated. Mark decided halfway 
through our third year, though, thai he had other 
plans, and proposed in March or 1998. 

Both of our families were delighted. Mark 
and I both corne from a strong Lutheran back-
ground and ollr parents could not have been 
happier. Even Mark's three you nger brothers 
and my younger sister got along well . So both 
falllilics rlanned ror it wedding in June or 1999. 
Changing the Date 

About a month after we became engagt:d, 
Mark decit.lcd to change lhe rlans again and 
suggested that we move the wcdding date up an 
entire 10 months 10 September of that year. 

vcn I ori gina lly scoffed at th l! idea, Like I 
mcntioned before, I had always believed that 

thc ordt.:r shou ld be graduate and Ihcn gel 
married. But thc more Mark and I talked 
about il, the more I liked the idea, 

1 rt.:alized that it was silly to put off an event 
thal was going to make Mark and me extreme-
ly happy just becaus~ it seemed like it was out 
of the "normal" order of things. Even though 
we understood that our first yea r at school 
wo uld he difficult both fina ncially and logisti -
ca lly, Mark and I knew that if we had to cat 
macaroni and cheese for a year to save money, 
it would be worth it ir we were married to each 
other. 

Dali ng cannot compare to bt:i ng married. I r 
you are married, and you are having a bad day, 
the person you want to comfort you and help 
YOll fee l beller is always waiting for you at 
home. When 'you are dating, you have to I.:all 
your boyfri end and leave a message with his 
roommate whom you know is goi ng to forget 
the second he hangs up. Then you have to call 
his work, find oUllhat he is not Ihere and then 
si t at home alone fee ling worse and worse 
because he is not there to help you fee l bc:tter. 

When you arc married, you do not have to 
spend the summers al home a mi ll ion miles 
away from your best rriend, you get to spend it 
together goi ng on vaca tions and generall y hav-
ing fun, ouples who are dating have to say 
"goodbye" when nighttime COmes, couples 
who are married get 10 say "Sec you when we 
wake up." When you are marricd, the two of 
you are always there for each other, when you 
arc da ling, it seems like you are always tryi ng 
to locate each othcr.

Continued from page 13 
Mark and I disl:ussed all of these rca ons with our parents. 

Although they were co ncerned about our linancial stability and 
the fact we would be gelling married before we graduated, they 
left the linal deci sion to us, promising that they would support 
us whatever our del:ision was. Mark and I did not have to dis-
cuss it for very long, and we decided to plan the wedding for 
Sept. 12, 1998. 
Planning 

Planning an average we;:dding, according to every bridal 
magazine, web site and wedding guide out there, takes abou t 
one year, though most recommend starting up to two full years 
before the date. A wedding is no run down to Vans and throw 
some paper plates, napkins, chips and soda in your cart type of 
party. A wedding is an invite everyone you have ever known, 
send out special invitations, hire a l:a terer, norist , OJ and coor-
dinator, and worry about everything down to the color of the 
chairs kind of party. It is absolutely realistic to say it takes a year 
and a half to plan a wedding. 

My mother and I, on the other hand, had less than five 
months to plan my wedding. 
Only Five Months to Go 

Planning a wedding in five months is co mpletely possible. 
My mom and I managed to pull it off - but we just got really 
lucky about many things. 

Originally, the date we had wanted to have the wedding was 
already booked on the church ca lendar. This is what wedding 
planners mean by preparing two years in advance. Most church-
es. reception locations. caterers and tlori sts are booked months 
before the event. 

We struggled to choose another date. but we couldn't se llic 
on one that was sati sfactory. My 1110' 11 . who is a teacher. woull 
he ~tarting school two weeks befoll.:. w anything earlier than the 
12th would he too dinicult for her. She also had an overnight 
lielt! trip the Wednesda after the 12th. plus Back-to·School 
ni ght on thm Thur~day. ~o the week followlllg was too bu~y. 

Pm a whi le. we did not think we wou ld he ahle LO find a good 
day to have the wedding. Then onl! afternoon. the church office 
called to ~~Iy that th l! couple who had originally booked the 12th 
decided to postpone their wedding. so the church was open. My 
mom booked our wedding that evening. 

Another fal: lOr thm most brides have to worry about is their 
dress . Typically. a hride would haY\: to tryon ahout a thousand 

dressl!~. sClll1! on on' and then order it from the manufacturer. 
Then the bride would have to stress out for the five to eigli t 
months it takes to come In. hoping it would come in ontil11e -
i.e. before thl! wedding. 

I decided I did not ha ve time for all that stressfu l wai ting. so 
I bought Illy dress off the rack <It a bridal store and lOok it home 
wi th me the same day. I was lucky that the dress fit f~\lrl y we ll 
and that it wa~ in very good sh<lpe. I took it to a seamstn.:ss, she 
took the dress in in a few places. and I was don' with my dress. 

My mom and I also were IUl:ky with many other things. The 
rCl:eplion site. which was Qutsidc in the backyard and vineyard 
of one of the students in her class, was easi ly hooked. The do 
not have weddings at their home ver often, so we didn 't have 
to worry about it being booked already. ur reception location 
was set. 

At first, the tlorist s w wanted III work with could not work 
on cpt. 12 because one was going to be out of the country that 
weekend. But when they found out that we didn ' t need any

to feel scared. 

Although I wuuld have liked it to 
happen, it wouldn't be truthfult say 
I was calm 100 percent of the time. 
When Ilirsttook Mark \ ann and we 
walked up into the chance l, my legs 
were shaking and my stomach ICIt a 
lillie nervous. It only lasted for the 
first fi ve minutes or ~o. hut I fClt it. 

It was a beautiful day. Every 
detail fell into place. All of the 
gUCSh enjoyed themselves, Mark 
and I had fun and we drnve away 
under the strings of li ghts my dad 
had put up in a car covered with 
toot hpaste and crate paper. 
Being a Married Student There was the detai l of watering and misting every day the 

ivy topiaries we were growing for tahle centerpieces . There was 
the detail of linding a slip and shoes and pantyhose and a veil 
for me, the d tail of finding a good mother-of-the-bride oullit 
for my mom. and the detail of coordi nating the construction of 
six bridesmaids dresses with our seamstre,s. 

There was the detail of making sure we had a big enough 
dance floor and the ri ght amount of tables and chairs. the detail 
of using a pu,h lawn mower to clear a two-acre lield of weeds 
that would be the reception parking lot (way to go, Dad !). 

Moving down to San Diego to 
start the school year was great fun . 
Mark and I rented aU -Haul. 
packed it up, drove it down and 
moved into our first apartment. 
While we were still going through Dinner: At the reception, Megan and Mark are toasted by family and friends . 

There was the detail of gelling the reception planner to the DJ 
and the linal head count to the caterer (we were exactly right , way 
to go, Morn !) and the detail of making ~urc Mark and I would be 
together betwc~n the hours of 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on a weekday so 
we could apply for a marriage liccn~ > - a diftiL:ult task since our 
families live twu hours away frol11 
each other and we only got to sec 
each other on weckcnd ~. 

Planning a wedding is all about

They were right, I shou ld have

boxes and organiLing piles of stu ff, school 
started and our student statu ~ changed to married. 

Becoming a maiTied student is like suddenly becoming differ-
ent from everyone. Our friend Dave said it is like we have a mys-
terious aura around us. All our friends now view us as "the mar-
ried couple" and want to come over and ~ce our apartment like it 
is a museum. They ask us a million questions ahout what it i, like 
and if it feel s weird to be married. 

Truthfully, it doesn' t. It l11ak e~ 
Mark and me happy and excited and 
grateful , but it doesn't feel weird. It 
feels like this is how we shou ld nat -
urally be. 

II can he harder than being a sin-
gle student becau~e Mark and I arc 
financially independent. We have to 
worry about paying tuition and rent 
and phone bill s. Mo~t students still 
have thei r parents paying for many 
of the expensive th ing~, but Mark 
and I do not. We were fortunate that 
Mark had such a good joh over the 
summer and that we cou ld save up 
money to last u~ the school yellr. We 
~t ill have to he very frugal. but it IS 
worth it to be ahle to be together. 

Most students who we arc intro-
duced to arc shocked when they 
find out wc arc married. Many tell 
us that they could not even contem-
plate being married at that point in 
their lives. 

I think ahout this when I walk 
around campus looking al other stu -
dents and (;(juples. So few other SIU-
dents arc married. I remember the 
only other married student I knew 
was a girl in my chem lab a couple 
years ago. I thought she seemed 
very old and mature and very differ-
ent than single students. 

How ClJuld I not be nervous'! I 
was not nervous becau~e I did not 
want to be. I did not want to spoil the 
day with worrying, I wanted to full y 
enjoy everything that wa going to 
happen. I wanted to be exclled,

not feel old Qr different. In fact . 
although I am 21, most people think 
I look about 15 or 16. 

In a way, though: I do feci a lillie more mature. I feel that 
Mark and I being married shows others that we are very serious 
ahout our relationship and our love for each other. We know we 
arc going to be with each other 50 years down the road . and it 

rnake~ us happy.

Being a married student is wonderful - I wouldn't trade it 
for anything.

PSYCHO THERAPY 
Make laughter and friendship the solution to roommate ruin 

MARY HIGGINS 
Senior Sfuf!' Writer 

"I thought you wou ld he feminine 
and delicate." she teased me years 
later, as we ate dinner at our favorite 
restaurant. "I saw your name on the 
roommate list and pi(;tured you with 
long hair and wearing a dress." 

I starcd across the table at my 
rriend - we' ll call her Wilma so 
she can ' t sue me - and thoughtful -
ly skewered another piece of 'ushi 
on my chopstick. 

"Well , I mu st have shocked the 
hell out of you," I commented, 
thinking back to four years ago 
when we had met during freshmen 
Welcome Week. 

I'd moved into the Warren resi-
dem;e hall with onl y a wet suit , 
so me camping gear and two 
changes of clothes - the previous 
three days I'd hcen camping in the 
descn with the waterski team. 

Sunburned, filth y and tired, I 
wat(;hed my seven sui temates 
unpack their frilly bedspreads and 
framed posters. Some of them lis-
tened to Barbra Streisand. 

I unrolled my bright-red sleep-
ing bag across the bed. 

"My parents life sending the rest 

of my stuff next week ," 1 se lf-con-
scious ly told anyone who asked. 

When Federal Express finally 
delivered my Blues Brother poster, 
Metallica CDs and clothes (scarce-
ly a dress in sight), I hardly fe lt like 
"one of the girls." The rest of them 
seemed a world apan from my 
tomboy upbringing. 

Wilma was the gi rli e~t of them 
all , in my opinion. She was well -
spoken. She had good posture. She 
carried herself with conlidem:e far 
more sophisti cated than her I 
years. I didn ' t think the two of us 
would have much in common. 

Despite our diflcrences, Wilma 
and I hecame fri ends. She accepted 
my tendency 10 belch and 10 work 
the .o F-word" into every other sen-
tence. In return, I made an attempt to 
understand her frequent use uf hai r-
styling appliance~. I was also int ro-
duced to the eyelash curler, a clamp-
like gizmo that looks lik it was 
made for castrating small animals. 

Our influence over each other 
was profound. Wilma and I had pri -
vate jokes that didn ' t make sense to 
anyone else hut they cracked us up 
every time. She took me to a duel-
ing-c larinet performance (they 
pfayed the clarinets, instead of 
whacking each other with them as I 
had originally thought). I tri ed to 
share with her the deep and mean-
ingful world of Metallica, but it 
never really caught on. 

Sophomore and junior years we 
stayed close though we no longer 
lived together and continued to 

N ever underestimate the 
importance of people.

simplistic to Ihe most advdnced , and

grow in different directions. Wilma 
got involved with student council. I 
joined the Guardian. Our lives 
became di ssimilar, but she was still 
my first choice if I wanted to vent. 

I knew I could count on Wilma 
for good advice and she never 
seemed Offended when I ignored 
her and did the opposite of what 
she sugge~ t cd . I dyed my hair 
black. I gut a talluo . I wasted most 
or my romantic energy chasi ng 
after a superficial. arrogant jerk 
who didn ·\. know I was alive. 

Wilma cou ld alway~ be depend-
ed on to lend an ear when my lofty 
plans plummeted to the ground . 

" I hate my hair like this!" I 
cried, looki ng like that pa~ ty-faced 
Wednesday from the Adam 's Fami -
ly. "I swear I'll never dye my hai r 
bla(;k again !" 

But I did dye it four more times 
bcfore my senior year. She never 
once said I told you so. 

Our friendship wa~n ' t perfect, of 
course. I rememhcr one nasty light 
we had while watl:hing "Backdraft ." 
Our first mi stake was to watl:h the 
whole movie, instead of just fa~t ­
forwarding to the infumow, fire 
engi ne love scene. 1\ got late and we 
were hoth cranky. I forget what was 
said, but I rememher slamming the 
door hchi nd me when I left. 

Funny, I don't remember if we 
apologized to each other or not , but 
I remember being reli eved things 
were back 10 normal the next day. 

Our fri endship would have con-
tinued this way, ordinary and unre-

markablc, except for a series of 
events last November - our fourth 
year of school - that added an 
unexpected twist. 

Wilma fO l! nd herself without 
housing and I offered her my 
l:ouch, although I didn 't imagine 
she would al:l:ept. Friends seldom 
dared to visit me in my 70s-deco, 
roach-infested ' Claircmont neigh-
borhood. I don' t know what could 
have compelled her to move in a 
few days later, claiming my saggy, 
second-hand couch as her own. 

I had been li ving alone for six 
months at this point and wasn ' t sure 
how [ would like sharing my tiny 
home with another person. Like most 
roommate , I expected there would 
be territorial squabble over kitchen 
rights, bathroom use and whether to 
watdl "Jerry Springier" or "Oprah." 

I didn' t expect it to be one long 
sl umher party. We went shopping. 
We stayed up until all hours talk-
ing. We made late- night trips 10 In-
'N-Out . We told secrets. 

Underneath our humor-fill ed 
banter, however, we were dea ling 
wi th pri vate p;J in in our personal 

li vc~. She felt up-rooted and tired of 
living out of her suitcase. I was close 
to failing Out of school. I learned 
there are two kinds of people in 
world: those who bail on you when 
the chips are down and those who 
stand by you when things get tough. 
Wilma and I saw each other at our 
worst and it brought out our best. 

When she moved, my apart mCfll 
fdt quiet and empty. We t:a ll e~ eat: h 

other all the time; I spent more 
hour ' on the phone with Wilma than 
I did. wi th my boyfriend . For me it 
was a rare reeling to be in a friend-
ship where the two of us never ran 
out of things to say. 

She graduated la t spring and I 
knew that summer would be the last 
time we lived in the same city. 
Whenever the two of u~ had a break 
for our jobs, we spent time together. 
I bought a kayak in July and she 
went with me to pick it up at Sports 
Chalet. We were there for several 
hours, trying to install the sport rJcks 
on top of my (;ar. The sun went down 
and the store employees locked up 
and went horne. In the fluorescent-lit 
UTC parking lot Wilma and I were 
slill giggling and lrying to figure out 
why we had 0 many "extra pans." 

" It 's OK," I said , reass uring her 
that if we drove home the rig would 
stay on top of the ca r. 

"Mary, it 's nowhere near OK'" 
she screeched. 

And then Wilma - my girl y 
friend who Ii ked to wear ski rt s and 
had perfectly styled hair - fini shed 
installing my car rack the right way. 

So much for being a tomboy. 
When she left for Michigan two 

months ago, I thought I wou ld miss 
her like crazy. Then I rea lized I talk 
on the phone with her about three 
times a week, which is sti II more 
than I talk to most of my fri ends. 
When 1 got my $70 phone hill I 
hardly flinched . 

It was like buying $70 worth of 
laughter.

COFFEE TALK KI- MIN SUNG 
Staff Wri[er I Campus has an array of choices for our cajJeinated p leasure 

Week four is just beginning, and 
so is Ihe studying for many stu-
dents at UCSD. For those of you 
looking for a good cafTeine fix to 
help you catch up on four weeks 
wonh of material and A . . Lecture 
Notes, here are some poi nters for 
finding the righl cofTee place on 
campus to fulli II your nceds. 

Real es tate entrepreneurs 
emphasil.e thrcc aspcl.:t~ of doing 
grc<ll busi ness: location, IOl.:ation, 
location. Cenlered III the heart of 
campu~, spre~~() ROlllll awaits the 
sleepy souls departing rrom the 
East Parking shullies. 

In addition 10 its convienient 
location, Espresso ROlll3 keeps its 
doors open from moming to late 
night to ofTer a wide variety of 
drinks and snacks. Hours are from 
7 a.m. to midnight Monday through 
Thursday, 7 a.m. to 10 p,m. on Fri-
day, 8 a,m, to 9 p.m, on Saturday, 
and l) a.m. to midnight on Suday~ , 

If anything can be said aboUi 
Roma (as it is endearingly ca lled 
by its loyal patrons), it is erticicnl. 
Its service is rast. even when lines 
go out the door, Drink prices arc sct 
at reasonable levels tbat arc com-
peti tive with otber es tabli shment~ 
on campus. Roma \ prices rangc 
within 5 to 10 cents more ur less of 
other campus cafes. depending on 
Ihe size and the ex tra~ yuu add on 
for fla vor. 

Roma also offers patron~ uccess 
to the [nt ernet and e-mai l with the 
new iMac stations it ha~ installed 10 
replace Ihe lasl year's archaic com-
puters. Thl:re is a variety of rood 
and drinks 10 choose fr Ill . ~uc h as 
mochas, teas. soups. pa~tri cs and 
olher food items like vcgg ie and 
pasla ~alad~. 

Roma meet ~ tht: standards of 
mosl average ca fe s. hUI fall s short 
of anything exceptional. Quality in 
drinks and drink preparation IS 
nonex istent. Students onen com-
plain aboul receiv ing a co ld cup of 
coffee or a nice lump of grin Is in 
their drink. The taste is often incon-
sistent , with low point ~ ranging 
from walery to downrighl hill ~ r, 
Food items do not appear as palat-
ab le when they are len in the open 
for the appetites of insecls, in ~ l cad 
of being enclosed hehind a pla~lit: 

case like at other estahli shments on 
campus such as Northem Lights 
and Grove Cafe. 

I wou ld recommend studying al 
Roma for those students who need 
background noise to prevent them 
from loosing concenlration. For 
some reoplc, too much ~i lence 

induce~ , Ieep. whidl is why many 
~tudents bewme nareolepli c uron 
entering Ihe library. Roma offers 
the hU~lle and hustle thai can drown 
out even your clme~t neighbor', 
latest light wilh hi ~ signlli cant 
ot her. 

For those who need sound , 
Roma is the place. But good luck 
linding a tahle anywhere in the 
Price Cenl er, If you have perfect 
posture. take the hard wooden scats 
inside ROl11a. Otherwi se, go out on 
Ihe deck and enjoy wme unshine 
while you're out there on the new 
wire patio furniture. Be warned.

What the Grove Cafe has that 
not many others can boast is

H20 POLO: 
usc almost loses in 
upset to Tritons 
Continued from page 27 
ter. But the Tritons quickly cut 
the advantage to 2- 1. For the 
remainder of the game no team 
was ahead by more than one goal , 
and the fans never stopped cheer-
ing. 

Behind a pai r of goals by sopho-
more Justin Wyli e, UCSO actually 
took the Icad, 5-4, at halftime. The 
USC coach and his players were 
obviously stunned. 

The Trojans camc ou t and tied it 
early in the third quarlcr, hut 
UCS D would not go away. The 
Trojans took the lead at 6-5 , hut the 
Tritons caug ht them. With the 
score knotteJ at eight , the crowd 
knew that It was in for a tremen-
dous fini sh. 

Although CSD had the 
Trojans on the ropes, U C was not 
about to fold . They just ke[1t com-
ing at the Triton~ , ami took the lead 
at 10-9 in the fourth quarter. 

Then Gordon Beh hrought the 
~ rowd to it s feel in perhaps 
UCS O's most memorahle goal in 
the past few years. 

He was on lOp, near the two-
point line, with his bac k to the goa l. 
As is the custom in water polo, he 
was talking to his teammate. , try-
ing to organize the attack. 

While he was yelling. however. 
the Trojan defense lulled just a bit. 
Beh then sprung hi s attack. He 
whirled and fired an amazi ng hot 
past the Trojan goalie. The Tritons 
were now up, 11 - 10, and everyone 
went balli sti c. 

" onmlly when I coach. I am 
almost emotionless," Harper sai d. 
"But when Gordon scored that 
goal, i was overwhelmed." 

So was everyone else in atten-
dance. At that point , the Tritons 
truly believed that they could do 
the impossihle . 

They hegan to play intense 
dcfen 'e, led by the fantas ti c play of 
juni or Ross Mecham . Everyone 
was stcpping up ror UCSD. Evel 
~uhsti tution Harper made wa~ 
genius. The Tri tons cou ld taste the 
win . 

But the Trojans just ke[1t com-
ing. George Csaslar ti ed the 
game. and James Castl e managed 
to sneak a goa l past UCS D 
defense with less th an three min-
utes to go, putting USC ahead, 12-

With the clock down 
below flye seconds, 
UCSD stili hadn't 
made a shot. Dlen 
they lost the ball, 
and Cole had to 
wheel and fire a 
desperation shot. 
As It sailed toward 
the upper right 
post, Triton fans 
held their breath. 
The USC goalie was 
beaten - If the 
shot was on goal. 
But alas, t he ball 
sailed just over the 
cross bar, taking 
UCSD's upset hopes 
with it. 

The Tri tons weren 't dead yel. 
They skated very c l o~e 10 disaster 
as U C gained a mun ad vantage 
with less than two minutes to go. 

But Harper's troops fought the 
Trojans off and regained some 
momentum. 

Finally, with 30 seconds in the 
game, UCSD got its tinal shot to 
either tie or even win it. The 
Tritons brought the ball down and 
sent it into the comer. 

The Trojans com milled an ejec-
lion foul and the Tritons were 
given a man advanlage. Then the 
game came down the situation that 
has troubled the Tritons throughout 
the ent ire season: the ex tra-man 
advantage. 

The Tri tons restarted play and 
tri ed to get it down low to hole-set 
Doug Cole, hut were deni ed. The 
Trojans were playi ng great 
defense. 

The Tritons knew that they had 
to get a good shot off. becllUse the

tied the game. 

With the clock down helow li "e

- if the shot was un gua l. But a l a~ , 

the ball sailed ju t over Ihe cross

Sunday 's game was a great team 
effort for UCSO, as Beh led the 
way with three points on two goals. 
Mecham and Wylie had two goa ls 
apiece, and Cole, Vladimir Djapic • 
Andrew Silvestri and Ryan Dandy 
each scored one goal. 

Despite the tough loss, the 
Trilons learned a very valuable les-
son: they can play wilh anyone in 
the nation. which is ex tremely pos-
iti ve motivation. 

"These guys rea ll y played their 
guts out today," Harper said . "\

UCSD Still Rolling On 
STREAK: Tritons win 6th straight 2-0 over Vassar College 
By Jake Gordon 
Sports Editor 

As the end of the regu lar ~'Cason grows 
doser, every game gains more importance. 
Teams are fighting for a spot in the post-sea-
son and every match is crucial ; there is no 
room for erro r. Any one win at the end of 
the season could mean the difference 
hetween goin g to the 
playoffs or just sitting at 
home watching. 

The UCSD women's 
socce r team kn ows thi s 
rea lity. After starting olT a 
mediocre 4-2-1 in its lirst seve n 
games, the yo ung Triton squad has 
come together qu ite nicely and rallied off

handled it. 

Even though the Tritons were now on the 
board, they didn ' t stop their pursuit of more 
goals. Yet, the Brewer defense held linn . 
The game remained a one-goal affair until 
the 87th minute, when Brewer defender 

Julie French was taken down hard by 
forward Ci ndy Dostalek. Dostalek 

would eventually get a ye llow 
card for her actions, but the 
real incident occurred as the 
two were tangled up on the 

ground. 
Showing her frustration, French 

viciously ki cked both of her cleats into 
Dostalek's thi gh. All of this happened right 
in fro nt of the UCS D bench, whieh was

to let it happen. 

The referees did , however, take an inler-

Coach Brian McManus got a yellow card 
for arguing with the official. 

The rest of the first half was unevenlful , 
as the Tritons could not score and the 
Brewers had almos t no offense of their own. 

Due to a combination of strategy and 
tough UCSD defense, Vassar had only one 
shot in the entire game. 

Playing like that may hold the other team 
for a while, but it doesn't give yuu much

UCSD all the more dangerous. 

The UCSD defense has really stepped up

sophomore Emily Scheese and freshmen 
Erika Alfredson and Melanie Gephart , 
UCSD has given up only 4 goals during the 
six-game winning streak. 

Their current 10-2- 1 record puts the 
Tritons in the driver's seat for the playoffs,

UCSD is too big a hully to stay

UCSD dominated their Di vision 
III w unterparts on their way to a 
third-place fini sh for the men and a 
fourth-place fini sh for the women. 
Only UC Davis, hi <.:Q State and 
Cal tate Dominguez Hills bested 

SD's strong running. 
Leading lhe way for the Triton 

cause was sophomore James 
Nielsen. Nielsen hall led the tough 
competition as well as the wet and 
rainy conditi ons to w me away

enough to earn him all -confcrem:e 
recognition. 

''The men's race was very excit-
ing," Head Coach Ted Van Arsdale 
sa id. "We sat with every runner 

before the race to di scuss 
our strategy and 

approach, and it 
paid off. " 

UCS D 
<.:Quid not have 

cnjoyed such a great day 
of running without majo r 

contrinutions from the rest of the 
squad. 

Co-captain Kevi n Prindi ville 
gave the team a crucial 17th place 
fini sh wilh a time of 26:53.4. 
Equally big for thc Tritons was 
Franzwa Achic's time of 26:55.0, 
which was good enough to earn 
him 19th place. 

"James has been developing 
ex tremely well ," Van Arsdale said . 
"Only one person can be champ, 
but it takes every indi vidual to 
have the same intensi lY, focus and 
drive for a leam to win." 

The women's team ga ve an 
equally tough performance. The 
wo men were led by Meghan SCOIl. 
who recorded a personal best in the 
5K with a time of 18:27.5, go d 
enough for fifth overall and all -
conference recognition. 

"I'm really happy myself and 
especially labout I the team perfor-
mance. it was probably the hest 

team perfo rmance of the year," 
SCali ~aid . "Wc onl y got beal by 
Divl,ion II teams, I think that ,ays 
a lot." 

SCali was not the only major 
cont ri bulor on the weekend for the 
women's leam. Amie Wu ran a key 
race for the Tritons wi th a time of 
19:47.6 to fini sh 23 rd overall . 

"Meghan was phenomcnal out 
thcrc," Van Arsdalc said. "S he 
jumped in there and raced li ke a 
champ. And Amy [Wu) has ocen 
rea lly steady for us, she i ~ as tough 
a ' nails. 

"I think everyone ~ houl d be 
proud of our performance out 
there," Van Arsdale continued. "We 
can onl y be 100 perce/ll satisfied if 
we had won, but we raced excep-
tionally we ll under the ci rcum-
stances of the poor wea t her condi -
tions." 

The Tritons still have the 
NCAA West Regionals to dea l with 
and some tough competition lies 
ahead of them. 

"Our goa l of the year wa, to win 
regionals," ielsen said. 
''Everylhing else ha, just been 
preparati on for it. "

Tritons Take Trojans to Edge of Upset 
SO CLOSE: UCSD almost pulls off biggest upset in school hi tory a they lose by the slimmest of margins to USC 12-11 
By Travis Hili 
Associate Spor ts Editor 

It has been called the Uni versity 
of Southern Californi a, the Trojans, 
Southern Cal, SC, or, in Triton-
Land, the Uni versity of poiled 
Children or Stupid 
Crybabies. 

In any 
case, it would 
be an under-
statement to 
say that the Trojan ' aren' t 
well liked on UCSD's cam-
pus. USC is basically UCSD's 
exact opposite in most ways. 

These differences include ath-
letic tradition. The Trojans have 
one of the most storied histories in 
all of college sports. USC has the 
budget to spend millions on each 
sport, while at UCSD, a couple 
mi Ilion can take care of the ent i re 
athletic program. 

A good example of the diffe r-
ences between the two schools is in 
their recruiting. UCSD walerpolo 
Head Coach Denny Harper has 
three players on hi s roster that arc 
from oUlside of California, while 
the Trojans have four player from 
outside the United States. Players 

from Yugos lavia , Slovakia and 
Croatia are on USC's roster. That 's 
not to say thal UCSD does not sup-
port it athletics, rather that US 
has the money to field a profes-
sional team . a to see USC ranked 

No. I in the lalest water polo 
poll should not come as a 

surprise. 
Th e 

Trilons, on thc 
other hand , 

came into yesterday 'S 
malch against USC ranked 

No. 10. UCSD's men have never 
beaten " top-fi ve squad in their 
water po lo history, but Harper 's 
troops were not at all afraid. In 
fact, the Tritons knew they were 
playing good polo and had it in 
them for a big upset. 

In fact, they almost did it. The 
Tritons came within econds of 
pulling off what would have bt:en 
the biggest upsel in UCSD sports 
history, as lhey lost a 12- 11 nail-
biter ye terday afternoon. 

The atmosphere was electric at

fans. The fans knew their Tritons 
were on the precipice or something 
great throughout the match, espe-

dally the second half, and he!-

Tritons Still Have the Lead 
OVER?: UCSD was winning 2- \ over US lU before strange suspension 
By Travis Hill 
Associate Sports Editor 

How's thi s for up-to- the-minute 
reporting? The UCSD men's soc-
cer squad is actually playing U.S. 
International Uni versity right now. 
As a mailer of facl. the Tri tons 
arc leading 2- 1 and lhere 
arc ahout II minutes

OK. so lhe 
game's been III 
limbo since Saturday after-
noon. Techn ica lly, the match 
is not over yet. 

Confused yel'? Here's the expla-
nati on: 

Last Saturday UCS D took on 
USIU at Triton Soccer Stadium at 
RIMAC Field . It was a festive 
afternoon, as it was UCS D's 
Homecoming. There were hooths, 
a 3D-foot inll atahle slide, a 
swingin ' band, food and even a 
beer garden. The graduates of 
UCSD 's stori ed men's and 
women 's programs had already 
played in the always raucous 
Alumni Came, and the current 
mcn's team was more than ready to 
take the fi eld against the 
Globerunners. 

The stands were absolulely 

packed for the match, which 
proved to be a very exciting one. 
The Tritons were ohviously fi red 
up when Ihey began allacking frolll 
the outset. Despite the fact Ihat for-
ward Brady Bernard was out wi th a 

red card , Anthony Funi ce llo 
and Scan Salinas picked 

up thc slack. 
Fi fth -year co-

captain John 
Brandon didn ' l start 

for hi s third straight 
match due to a concus-

sion, bu t he was hea lthy and 
ready to go. Head Coach Derek 
Armstrong substituted Brandon in 
early. 

Obviously exc ited lO get bac k 
on the field , Brandon made his 
presence fe ll immediately. Hi ~ fi rst 
louch in the game was a spectacu-
lar di ving header to score UCSD's 
firsl goal - one of the besl of the 
season. 

Brandon's effort sent the hun-
dreds of Triton fans into hysteri cs 
and made Armstrong look like a 
genius. It was a wonderful start to 
lhe match for UCSD, and lhings 
were looking very much in the 
Tritons' favo r. 

The clati on didn ' t last long,

how good they reu lly wt.!re. 

The Tri tons came out and out-

crowd was hungry for a goa l.

few times, and now they were 
looking for the kill.

older students and alumni blessed to be 
older that 2 1. 

SalUrday was SO's Homewming, 
and it was all anyone <.:ould have hoped for. 
The <.:rowd was electri<.:, the band was play-
ing, the burgers were cooking, the beer was 
nowing, the home team was fighting for a 
vi<.:tory and the big U SO flag was waving 
franti<.:ally. 

The day was just like Homecoming at 
any major school, ex<.:ept for one small 
detail : unlike almost every other large-
sports program, there were no first downs, 
no Hail Mary passes and no quanerba<.:k 
sacks. At UCSD's gala event, there were 
slide tackles. high crosses and goals. as the 
men ' soccer team played the "Big Game." 

It was not quite traditional and yet, even 
for the mo t ardent spons fan, the day was 
fantastic . There may be no football here in 
lovely La Jo ll a, but there was an exce llent 
halftime show. 

Between halves of the men 's soccer 
game, reprcsentatives from Sears oflkia lly 
presented CSD with the Scars Directors ' 

up. a trophy awarded to the best athletic 
program in each of the collegiate divisions. 

SD is the first school ever to win the 
car ' up without a football team. ptoving 

that just throwi ng th pigskin doesn't make 
a great athletic department . hancellor 
Robert Dynes anti Athletic Director Judy 

weet accepted the award for SO. 
urrounding them were the many spons 

teams that contributed to the victory, 
including the National ham pion women 's 
volleyball and women 's soccer squads.

Fe~ ti v al. A hig hit 
for the adu Its. 
however. was the

umph in it~elt' for 
the athletic depan-
ment. Thi s reporter 
spent plenty of time 
in that fabulous alum-
ni wonderland. sipping 
on the nc<.:tar of the gods. 

Besides all the festivi -
ties on RIMA Fie ld, alum-
ni games were played in most 
sports, including men 's water 
polo, women' volleyball , women 's 
soccer and -men's soccer. Present squads 
worked hard tryi ng to defeat players 
long since graduated. 

Meanwhi Ie, the celebration of 
Saturday carried over to unday for 
"Big Game II ," a tightly-conte ted men 's 
water polo contest between SO and No. 
I-ranked . Alumni helped supplement 
the usual SO student faithful by packing 
the stand ' for the secOl;d athleti <.: event. 
Everyone there shared in the exci tement as 
U 0 missed its biggest up 'et in its histo-
ry by just a few inches. 

All in all . Homecoming wa ' a joy. The 
mhleti<.: department did a remarkable job 
sell ing up thi s weekend 's events and the 
athletes of past and present again gave 
amazing performances for everyone's 
enjoyment. UCSD now has been recog-
ni zed as the best athletic program in 

Divi ion Ill . and it has it sight , set on the 
same goal when it receives Division II sta-
tus. If last weekend was any indication, the 
move to Division II will be a great success. 
We've shown that 's its po sib le to have a 
great Divi ion III athletic program without

footba ll. Now we need to go ahead and 
sh w Division II we can win without schol-
arships. If anyone can do it , UCSD 
Athletics can. Congratulations to all Triton 
athletes and UC 0 ports fans al ike. 
Homecomi ng 1998 was a huge succes .
