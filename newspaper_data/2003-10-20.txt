UCSD looks for leader 
Search committee meets 

By BRYAN TSAO 
Contributing Writer 

U President and former 
hancellor Robert Dynes named 

a 17-member advisory committee 
to aid in the search for the new 

C D , hancellor on Oct. 15 . 
The committee will meet three 
tlllles to solicit input from the 
UCSD community, review rec-
ommendation from a subcom-
mittee of faculty and present a 
final list of six to eight candidates 
to D\11e~.

dent representatives and repre-
~ematives of the alumni, staff and 
community. 

The fir t meeting \Va held on 
ct. 17, when it convened for 

most of the day to meet commu-
nity leaders and administration 
and faculty member . 

"What the search committee 
mu t do is ta lk to the various 
stakeholder in the community to 
make sure they understand the 
essential qualifications, as viewed 
from the point of view of the 
admini trator , community lead-
er and faculty, and eventually see 
what the commonalities are so 
that they can not only put togeth-

er the right job description, but 
identify candidates that respond 
to what this community believes 
is important in a leader," Vice 
Chancellor for External Affair 
James E. Langley said. 

The committee's current time-
line, released on Acting 
Chancellor of UCSD Marsha 
Chandler's Web site, calls for 
them to presem Dynes with their 
recommendations in January 
2004, with Dynes then interview-
ing the final candidates. Dyne 
expects to complete the inter-
views and recommend one candi-
date to the regents at a closed ses-
sion meeting in February 2004. 

The regents hope to have a 
new chancellor by the end of 
Winter quarter. Delay~ have 
already pushed the final recom-
mendation date from January to 
February. 

While the committee has nor 
yet officially received any nomi-
nations or applications, U 
bylaws require the president to 
ubmit between five and 15 nom-

inations to the committee. 
"We'll reach a point very soon 

where they will invite nomina-
tion ," Langley said. "There has 
been a job description that has 
been posted in advertisements, 
and I think people are starting to 
apply, but the earch committee 
has not yet sat down and looked at

nations yet."

Student fee 
policy discussed 

By GAELLE FAURE 
News Editor 

The UC Student Association 
held their first meeting of the quar-
teratUCSDonOct.18andOct.19. 
The first day of the conference was 
marked by discussion of student fees 
and their use in student government 
lobbying, as well as talk of how to 
form relationships with the tate's 
new governor-elect and suggestions 
of offsetting decrea ing campus ser-
vices by increasing registration fees. 

Student government lobbying 
received attention on a system-wide 
level prior to the Oct. 7 recall elec-
tion when UC Berkeley officials 
investigated the Berkeley Graduate 
Student Association's expenditure of 
$35,000 in student fees on an anti-
Proposition 54 campaign.

New recycling program adopted 
Campus switches to single-stream method 

By WINNIE CHAN 
Contributing Writer 

Phy ical Plant ervice is imple-
menting a campus-wide ingle-
stream recycling program, 

sistanr ICC Chancellor of 
uxiliary and Plant erviee Gary 

Matthews announced on ct. 14. 
"We're revi ing the existing 

recycling program," Matthew said. 
"Before, you had to epa rate the 
paper from the gla and can and 
put them in at least two different 
rccycllll!{ bin. N w, all recyclable 
products go into one bin and the 
waste company sorts [material l." 

Imllar program have been 
'ldopted in the Cine of hllla Vi t3 
Jnd an Diego as well a III the an

IllOrc efficlelH In Illany ways, 

Matthcw~ did. 
"It saves the mdividuJI per on in 

a room or office from hJving to SOrt 
their rccyclables," \1atthew ald. 

In addition, the w re company 
can do the sorting more em lent-
Iy by u Ing conveyer belts r hlr-
IIlg workers to m3nuJII ort 
waste . 

lanytudent favor thl new 
IIlgle- tream recyclIng program. 

"Ln ternlS of malang it ea ler for 
people to recy Ie, It' ,I good tiling," 
,ampl1 Greens member David 

Leeman aid. "The more conve-
nient it IS, the more IIkel people 
will be WillIng to help our." 

John Muir College freshman 
Jean Long agreed that single-
stream recycling will "definitely" 
make recycling much easier. 

"The one bin for all my recy-
clable is convenient," Long aid . 

Matthews agreed that It wa 
more convenient for students. 

"It puts the burden of re(;ycling 
on the company," Matthews said. 

Thi new program al 0 aves the 
campus money by diverting recy-
cI ble items from g IIlg mto a land-
fill, 1atthews said . The wa te 
hauler, pecific Waste, pays by the 
tOn for certain recyclables, uch a 
high-quality paper. 

wTbe volume IS never that great 
where we make In re nloney than 
we spend to throw It away," 

l.mhew ' Said. 
I f the campus recycles, It offs,ts 

cost, ace rding to Mdtthews. 

"We hope that this encourages 
people to recycle more because it 
costs less to recycle than it does to 
bury things in a landfill, and It I bet-
ter for the environmenr," t'vtatthews 
aid. "We're not uolizing the riche 

of the Earth and then disposmg 0 It. 
We're using it multiple nmes." 

Discussion concerning ,hlfting

MONDAY, OCTOBER 20, Z003 THE UCSD OUARDIAN 

UCSA: Center for Campus Free Speech rep talks 
continued from page I 

that Berkeley official used in criticiz-
ing the spending were old policies that 
had not been updated on the universi-
ty's Web si te. T he Uni versity of 
California's policies n student fees is 
currently lUldcr revision, with a new 
vcr ion expected in January. 

"[The Berkeley situation] was a 
good thing because it helped us realize 
we need to be very cri tical of student 
poli,lc, lh,1t arc coming our," Joshi 
said. "We need to make sure that all of 
the loopholes get d osed up and that 
student ' rights arc rea lly protected." 

Robb T homson, a representative 
from the Center for Campus Free 
Speech, a non-profit organi za tion 
based in Boston, made a presentation 
on student fcc spending. Thomson 
pointed to the two purported roles 
for college student governments. 

April La bbe, who has been involved 
in discu sions with the Univer ity of 
Californ ia ffi ce of the President 
regarding the new draft fee policy, 
spoke on the importance of making 
the UC administration receptive to 
student input on the new policy. 

"The new draft policy is hazy," 
Labbe said. "The chances of them com-
ing out in our rovor is really, real ly slim." 

Joshi , who gave the example of a 
College Republica ns' affirmative 
action bake sale that had been shut 
down recently at UC Irvine , said fees 
shouldn't become a partisan issue. 

"It's really about all students' free 
speech," she aid. 

UCSA members decided every 
campus would take action in present-
ing a united front on the issue by sub-
mitting op-ed pieces to campus news-
papers and informing local legislators 
on the issue by ovember. 

fcc. Registration fees for UC students 
currently total $71 3, and have not been 
ralscd for over a decade. Since the reg-
isuation fce goes toward supporting 
student services on campus, Fong said 
that increasing it would benefi t stu-
den ts through services. 

"They don't have enough budget to 
make up for increased costs and last 
year's 20 percent budget," Fang said. 

Student Regent Mart Murray was 
also present, and spoke on the impor-
tance of preventing governor-elect 
Arnold Schwarzencgger from cutting 
funds to the UC system. 

~ I think our new governor-elect 
presents an opportunity or a challenge, 
depending on how you look at it," 
Murray said. "Until January, OUI main 
goal should be to focus on him and see 
what his budget will be like and tty to 
affect that before it comes out." 

Murray also said that the regents 
this year would be talking ~substan­
tially" about increasing fees again.

"One is kind of a bank, handing 
Out mon ey to student organizations 
and such," he sa id. "The other is 
being an advocate for the student 
body, which is the version I like, and 
I thlilk the situation right now ques-
tions your abil ity as student govern-
ment leaders to advoca te on those 
Im portant Issue that affect students 
and the communities you live in." 

U A Universi ty Affa irs Director 

A different aspect of student fees 
was discussed in a report by the 
Council on Student Fees, which is 
independent from UCSA but works in 
coordination with the association. 
Betty Fong, chair of the CSF, suggest-
ed that recommendations should be 
made to the UC Regents that, if tu-
dent fees should be raised again, they 
should consider raising the registration 

UCSA also discussed action items 
for the year, which include encourag-
ing spending on education in tead of 
prisons, holding the UC Regents 
accountable for implementing campus 
environmental sustainability plans, 
and working toward permanently 
funding K- 12 outreach funding.

[n order to facilitate the search, the com-

incorporated to aid in recruiting, screening 
and conducting interviews. 

"The search firm is there to manage and 
support the efforts of the advisory commit-
tee," UC spokeswoman Lavonne Luquis 
said. "The advisory committee, through the 
work of the search finn, initiates the candi-
date review process and considers the quali-
fications of each candidate." 

Once reviews have been conducted and a 
list of candidates presented, the search fiml will 

conduct reference and preliminary background 
checks and help in providing an "overview" of 
each candidate, Luquis said. 

"The search fi rm assists with maintaining 
strict confide ntiality throughout the process 
and will as ist the pre ident in negotiating 
the terms of the appointment," Luquis said. 

A. T. Kearney will receive compen ation 
equal to one-third of the expected annual 
salary of the future chancellor. 

According to the California Federation of 
Teachers, Dynes received a ba e salary of 
$276,600 while erving as chancellor.

Use of UCSD moniker broke rules 
so Web site must be shut down 

By KELLY GILBERT 
Contributing Writer 

The Web site made it 
eem so tragic. 

"UCSDllncm,rortd.rom is 
currently hut down as of 
Oct. 9,2003," It proclaimed , 
a lamentable little blurb in 
the mIdst of empty, white 
Web site space that used to 
be filJed WIth messages from 
hundreds of Tritons enJoy-
Ing a community-minded 
onlIne haven.

S. Aguilar, which e entJally

be shut down due to Illegal

with a prevIOUS warnIng.

-n-uc, the Web SIle, co-

created by students Joe 
MahavuthlvanlJ and Bon 

urdIn, was a good one . 
And true, It does look awful-
ly USPICIOUS that, according 
to Mahavuthivanij, "the 
school had been planning to 
release a forum very SImilar 

to UCSDuncmrortd.com." 
(Mahavuthivanij is con-
cerned that Aguilar's direc-
tive may have stemmed 

PRO 
from the uruversity's deSIre 
to ccure dOlrunance over a 
polential user base. It's po -
sible.) And true, prohibiting 
unauthoriz.ed usage of the 
name "University of 
Calrforma" does, as Gurdin 
remarked, sound slightly 
Irke disenfranchisement. 

evertheless, the code 
stili stands: JUSt as Nlke 
owns the ' woosh and 
McDonald' own the 
Golden Arche, the state 

own~ the name "Universlt:y 
of alIfornia ." Without 
explICit permiSSion granted, 
neither the name nor It~

a manner that would Indi -
ca te an endorsemelll by the 
unrverslty or affiliation to 
any otller estabh hment -
say, for example, to a Web 
site ho~tlng an "uncen red" 
access to the school. 

As the unrversity owns 
lhe name, the Board of 
Regen also has the nght to 

decide how they'd like to 
present the UC name -
their trademark - to the 
public. The UC system rep-
resents hundreds of thou-
sands of students nation-
wide, and it would do these 
srudents a severe disservice 
to allow any entIrely uncen-
sored content to be 
endor ed by the university. 
It's not unrea onable, then, 
to ask that webmasters 
obtain written permission 
from the Regents before 
3)sociating the Unrersity of 
California's name with 
whatever they wish.

UC Berkeley's admissions 
procedure comes under fire 

horse's 
mouth 

EdWu 

W ith the falling tem-perarures, it appears that wildfire season 
may be coming to an end in the 
brush, but if Board of Regents 
Chair John Moores' prelimi -
nary analysis of the UC 
Berkeley admissions process is 
any indication, fall signals the 
start of a new season of confla -
grations. A Lor Allge/u Tinw 
article has reignited the dry 
brush that has grown since the 
summer Supreme Court deci -
s ion striking down the 
University of Michigan admis-
sions system that awarded extra 
point to applicams of under-
represented races. 

This time, Moores has dis -
covered that nearly 400 sru-
dents that were admitted to 
Berkeley had S.A.T. scores 
ranging from 600 to 1,000, bad 
by any measure, but atrocious 
by the standards for the 
Univer ity of California (with 
the possible exception of 
Riverside and Davis, but 
maybe we hould "play nice" 
here) . n the other hand, 641 
students with scores above 
1,500 were denied admis ion. 

UC Berkeley Chancellor 
Rober! Berdahl fired right 
back in a letter to UC 
President Robert C. Dynes, 
comending that Moore' 
analysis was misguided, point-

ing out that since students 
who applied to different 
majors were considered sepa-
rarely, three certain engineer-
ing majors were far more com-
petitive than the rest. 

Second, Berdahl points out 
that U admissions policy 
requires that campu e take 
into account the circumstances 
behind an applicant's achieve-
ment - if a student went to a 
traditionally poorly perform-
ing high school, for example, 
lower .A.T. scores may still be 
an indication of promi e in a 
relative context. 

Furthermore, none of the 
applicants on the lowest end of 
the pool have yet dropped out 
of the school. 

Berdahl's defenses, however 
well-intentioned, still fall flat. 
The Berkeley admissions offi-
cers were no doubt aware of 
the effect of treating applica-
tions to different majors sepa-
rate ly, rather than admitting 
the class on the whole first, and 
then distributing the applica-
tions to departments (and col -
leges, as UCSD does) . 

How can anyone reasonably 
expect a high school senior to 
understand the various facets 
of a computer engineering or 
bioengineeri ng program to the 
point where he or she knows 
tha t the only way to succeed 
academically and later in life is 
by being admitted to one of 
these three majors? This is a 
rather ludicrous proposition -
despite the importance that an 
undergraduate major plays in 
strucruring one's srudies, jobs 
in the real world are not sepa-
rated by majors , and certainly 

any quality engineering (or 
physics, or chemistry) educa-
tion should enable a graduate 
to operate in a wide variety of 
disciplines. One might make 
the argument that with the 
specialization implied by 
choice of major in college, an 
art or dance major might show 
considerable promise in his or 
her chosen field, but that it 
would be irrelevant to that sru-
dent's S.A.T. scores . 

However, there are highly 
regarded institutions for those 
talenred in art and dance. In 
the more academic of majors, a 
degree from the University of 
California should imply not 
only mastery of the field in 
question, but also a satisfactory 
completion of rigorous general 
education requirements . 
Regardless if a student is an 
engineer, a srudio artist, or an 
ath lete, a UC degree should 
imply satisfactory writing abil-
ity and mathematical skill . If 
students come ill-prepared for 
that next step in their general 
education from high school, 
regardless of where their talent 
lies, it is difficult to believe 
they can be held to the same 
standards in both their general 
education and their major 
whi le receiving a remedial edu-
cation. 

And herein lies the problem. 
This is not a question of 
whether these applicants show 
talent, leadership experience or 
promise. It is a question of 
whether the University of 
California should offer remedi -
al education to correct the inde-

Grocery strike is selfish 
Health benefits already generous 

By lACH ROSEN 
Contributing Writer 

After a week, nearly 70,000 grocery 
store workers, from clerks to meat cut-
ters to pharmacists, remain on strike. 

10 many, the sound of 70,000 angry 
workers chanting slogans brings back 
memories of the good old days of the 
noble AFL-CIO bringing greedy cor-
porations to their knees. This, howev-
er, isn't your grandfather'S union. 

In short, unions today are cesspools 
of corruption and fight more for orga-
nized crime than organized labor. 
That's not to say that the grocery store 
workers are all members of La Cosa 
Nostra, but it gives you an idea of just 
whom the union leaders are looking 
out for. 

Simply, they are striking for elfish 
reasons. According to union spokes-
woman Barbara Maynard, the union is 
walking out because its employing cor-
porations are planning to shift $1 bil-
lion in health care costs onto workers . 
What she fails to mention is that the 
workers currently pay nothing for their 
health care. That's right - it's free . 

Most people already pay something 
for health care - usually several hun-
dred dollars - even if they have com-
pany benefits. Our own UCSD healm 
care plan charges $600 per year. Asking 
employees to share some of the costs 
for their health care is not unreason-
able, especially not while the company 
still covers the lion's share. 

Let's be realistic here: free health 
care for basically menial jobs is what's 
unreasonable. Senior clerks already 
make $1 7.90 per hour for nothing 
more than swiping items across a bar-
code reader. Talk about unskilled labor. 
The corporations are being overly gen-
erou by paying such an amount, let 
alone offering any kind of health care 
at all . 

The employees are being asked to 
pay $5 a week for individual covera~e, 
or $15 for families. If they work a 40-
hour week, that means that rather than 
earning $716 per week, they would 
make $701 per week. Gaspl The hor-
rors of paying $780 per year for com-
plete health coverage. They've already 
almost recovered the cost by working a 
single week, not including overtime. 

Traditional grocery stores are suf-
fering from the explosion of vVal-Man 
and other superstores, which have 
grabbed market share. These are non-
union stores, so their labor costs are 
significantly Ics . Recentl y, the IIltrO-
duction of superstores, which sell gro-
ceries alongside all sons of other Items, 
has caused sa les in grocery stores to 
drop significantly. Albensons alone has 
seen its market share drop from 60 per-
cent to 40 percent within four yea r of 
Wal-Man opening its first store . 

To continue bei ng competitive in 
the market, supermarkets have to cut 
costs somewhere, and labor costS make 
up 66 percent of a store's fixed costs. 

"You can see these are major dollars 
we're talking about - you can 't have 
expenses increasing faster than rev-
enues," said one industry analy t. If 
these clerks soli want their high-paytng 
jobs in several months, they will have 
to endure fewer benefits, lest their 
employers go out of business. 

Finally, let's not forget the real loser 
here: the consumer. You can't waste 
your time wandering the city to find a 
non-union store so you can avoid being 
yelled at for trying to buy food . What 
are we supposed to do - starve' 

To try to minimize the impact of 
their actions on consumers, me unions 
tell us to simply shop elsewhere. The 
only problem is that "elsewhere" con-
sists of non-union stores. Immediatel y

worse than

fensible disparities in alifornia 
K-12 education. while sacrificing 
academic standards in the 
process. Berdahl has defended the 
admission of these 3 I students 
by pointing our that none of them 
ha dropped out of school yet. 
The real question is why 
Berkeley's academic standards can 
accommodate 3 I students who 
cannot demonstrate a basic com-
petence in reading, vocabulary 
and arithmetic only a year before. 
While one might argue that to 
distill one's academic competence 
down to a number is meaningless 
and insubstantial . and chi writer 
might agree if we were compar-
ing an S.A.T. score of 1,200 to 
1,300, or 1,3 00 to 1.500. But how 
can one of the top university sys-
tems in the country, one which is 
supposed to serve by mandate, 
the top 4 percent of the graduat-
ing class, abide a substantial num-
ber of freshmen who test below 
50th percentile (a score of 1,0 10) 
in two areas that are core to gen-
eral education requirements? 

Berdahl also defends the 
admission of these srudents by 
contending that many had rather 
high grade point averages -
mdeed, only 17 percent had grade 
point averages under 3.50. 
However, a central component of 
comprehensive review assigns 
added value to an applicant who 
comes from a historically under-
performing high school. What do 
grades mean anyways if one 
comes from a school with a lack-
luster reputation' Does it mean 
that you have outperformed your 
cla.smates while receiving a lack-
I u ter education' How is that any 
different from outperforming 
your classmates while receivi ng a 
quality education ' It certai nly is a 

relative indication of talent, no 
doubt. But a high grade point 
average from a school with his-
torically poor academic record is 
no indication of objective acade-
mic preparedness. A central criti-
cism of the S.A. T. is tha t the 
scores are highly correlated to 
family income. The fallacy 
implied here is that wealth, in and 
of itself, is the causal factor to 
performance on the test. 

The real issue is that wealth is 
correlated to twelve years of aca-
demic preparation in our public 
chool system, so much so that 

graduates from inner city schools 
often end up at least three years 
behind those in suburban ones. 
These applicants are no less tal-
ented, but they are no doubt 
much less prepared. 

The dif6cul ty is that the core 
mission of the University of 
California seems to have run into a 
confl ict of fundamentals. On the 
one hand, the university is sup-
po ed to be the first-tier higher 
education system in the state - in 
a perfect world, there should be no 
need to sacrifice UC academic 
standards because we still offer 
ample opportunities through the 
CSU and community college sys-
tem to eventually end up at a UC 
campus as a transfer or in graduate 
school. The University of 
California remains the fir t-tier 
system not because we need ivory 
towers sprinkled through the state, 
but because it serves the economic 
and social goals of California to 
have a public education system 
with the most rigorous standards 
possible for a select group of stu-
dents. 

On the other hand, we recog-
nize that a racially and socially 
disproportionate population in 
that select group is a damning 

indictment of the travesty that is 
our educational system. One way 
to correct this might be to bal-
ance the difference by fiat, first by 
quotas and then by affirmative 
action. Someone had the gall to 
point out that 90 percent of the 
38 1 students were from under-
represented minorities, accusing 
university officials of backdoor 
affirmative action. The dispro-
portionate racial representation 
on the top side of the S.A. T. spec-
trum, on the other hand, does not 
seem to bother them. 

But, then again, is this not 
what the entire debate is about? 
Of course the university is con-
s idering race. If the admissions 
officers were banned from con-
sidering geography, family 
wealth and parental education in 
ways that are closely correlated 
with race, then the result would 
be a student body makeup that 
was politically indefensible. 

UCSD, likewise, abandoned 
its 50-50 policy of evaluating 
half of the incoming class based 
solely on scores and the other 
half on a varied set of criteria. 

Instead, UCSD now per-
forms comprehensive review on 
all applications, with the subse-
quent effect that the average 
S.A.T. scores for the incoming 
class dropped last year. I t does 
not take a genius to realize what 
the motivation for dropping 
purely objective cri teri a for half 
the class is. Both sides, by 
demonstrating the extremes of 
ei ther race- blind or race-con-
scious admissions policies, have 
forced a ludicrous si tuation 
where proxy variables are used 
instead of race to achieve a result 
that is reported in only one man-
ner - the ethnic breakdown of 
the incoming class.

The social justice of our lack 
of diversity at the University of 
California is appalling, and criti -
cizing comprehensive review 
may seem like a step backward. 
However, this writer has long 
argued against affirmative action 
- and now against comprehen-
sive review - because not only 
does it clearly lower academic 
standards, it places a band-aid on 
the real problem by creating 
equality of results by fiat . In the 
process, the university under-
mines both of the values in ques-
tion : it sacrifices its academic 
standards by becoming a remedi -
al institution, and it undermines 
social justice because its admis-
sions standards imply that these 
students are prepared regardless 
of their previous 12 years of 
schooling, obviating the need for 
rea l reform. 

The disparity between acade-
mic standards and resources 
given to the schools of suburban 
California, and those in rura l 
areas or the inner city is the real 
problem. If we are led to believe 
through our admissions systems 
that underrepresented minorities 
are prepared for higher educa-
tion despite their atrocious treat-
ment at the hands of the state, 
then we as a society can believe 
we have achieved social justice, 
and only the few of us who dare 
look beyond the racial break-
down of admissions statistics will 
be aware of the full magnitude of 
our failure . 

This is a lie that ca nnot be 
abided.

The web is ridden with other 
unauthorized UCSD sites that some-
how escaped Agui lar'S executioner's 
axe. For a couple years, 
UCSDuznuts.com was a spoof of 
UCSD's main Web si te , complete 
with plagiarized HTML code. The 
Koala used to advertise it on the car-
toon Koala bear's t-shirt on the front 
of every issue. The site seems to have 
come down on its own accord in the 
last couple months, but it was the best 
example of a site that damages the 
university'S good name. 

Then there's UCSD.com, which 
someone is acrually selling for at least 
$688 - probably more profit than 
UCSDuncensored would see in years. 

One lucky per on owns both 
UCSDrucks.ctml and UC Drucks.org-
si tes till under construction - which 
even the most deluded person could-
n't believe would bolster the ul1lversi-
ty's image. It could be worse though 
- "UCSDCanGoToHell. com" is sti ll 
available. 

If Aguilar were really worred about 
someone damaging th e university 's 
good name, hes got bigger fi sh to fry 
than UCSDuncensored, a sma ll

anybody. It·s a shame Aguilar and the

Pro: Alternatives to "UCSD" are available

name be changed to comply with 
the code - which really shouldn 't 
be that hard . According to 
Mahavuthivanij, it wouldn't be at 
all difficult to redirect traffic from 
the current UC Dunrenso7·td.curn 
address. 

Currently no such permission 
is granted, but alternate means of 
advertising a new address are cer-
tainly available. T hat's definitely 
not the optimal solution for the 
Web site's creators, but the 
University of California is under 
no obligation to make life easier 
for those who fai led to comply 
with its code. 

According to Gurdin, he is try-
ing to communicate with the uni-
versity regarding licensing. T he 

Web site's crea tors' first choice, of 
course, would be to continue to 
keep the name, in which they've 
invested a significant amount of 
time, effort and money. That may 
not be possible, but the universi-
ty's actions are in no way prevent-
ing the Web site from being fully 
functional and (a lbeit christened 
differently) virtually unchanged, 
with regard to content. Gurdin 
and Mahavuthivanij plan to 
reopen their online forum, in one 
form or another, in the near 
future . 

Furthermore, even the web-
masters have to admit the shut-
down was no less than fair. Gurdin 
himself said he believes Aguilar 
has exercised the law in a profes-
sional manner.

Ultimately, the issue becomes 
one of convenience. It may not 
be easy for UCSDuncensored to 
change its name or address, but 
it's certainly not an unfair 
request . The University of 
California has not only the right, 
but also the responsi bility to 
determine how it is associated 
with various organizations to 
most fairly represent all students. 
Shutting down 
UCSDuncensored sets an 
important precedent: It states 
that not .just any content, no 
matter how beneficial (or, on the 
flip side, no matter how obscene 
or incorrect), can be illegally 
affiliated with the University of 
California , and thus defame the 
university'S character.

OPINION 7 

Strike: Free health care will 
lead to higher grocery prices 

cominued from page 5 
after the strike is over, they will 
again scold us for not supporting 
union labor. Talk about hypocrisy. 

Let's say the unions get what 
they want - the companies cave, 
and continue to provide free health 
care . What will happen ? 
Supermarkets will sti ll have to find 
some way to continue to make a 
profit. So rather than cut costs, 
they will have to increase revenue, 
meaning higher prices on food. 
T he strikers will be standing smug-
ly behind their cash registers, mak-
ing their $17 .90 an hour, while real 
working people have to pay jacked 
up prices for necessary items. 

Wal -Mart will get an even 
greater market share when people 
run from high prices, costing gro-
cery stores even more money and 
eventuall y driving them out of 
business. T hen where will people 
be? ot only will consumers be 
forced to buy their groceries from 
superstores. those strikers who 
were so pleased with themselves for 
milking even more free benefits 
from corporations will find them-
selves on the streets without jobs. 

The union is putting ordinary 
people through a considerable 
ordeal in their ever-expanding 
quest for money and power, and it 
is inexcusable.

union's court victory. "The train is 
moving out of the tation, whether 
you eeitornot,andit'sabouthigh 
time [the universityJ gets on 
board." 

UC spokesman Trey Davis said 
that the confidentiality issue of ven-
ture capitalism is new ground ~ r 
the universi ty. 

"The university is opposed to 
re leasing information, but we 
have," Davis said. 

According to a UCOP press 
release, UC's overall endowment 
fund fell 10.7 percent last year, 
more than any other of the 10 
largest U.S. university endow-
ments , except for the 
Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, which dropped lUi 
percent. Also, UCOP said its pri-
vate equity investments declined 
21.5 percent in the year up until 
June 30, 2003 . 

Vennlre capItal funds are :l form 
of private equity investment that 
can take five years or more before 
funds return positively. Lnvesonent 
banking companies put together a 
list of companies, oftentimes start-
ups, they think will do well in the 
long run and present groups like 
the university widl the information. 

Venture capi tali ts depend on 
public funds and arb'ue that the 
release of internal rates or return 
would exposc information about 
the individual value of the compa-
nies, breaking the confidentiality 
agreement between the parrners. 

In fact, soon after the initial rul -
ing of the case on July 24, promi-
nent venture capital firm equoia 
Capital notified dle university that 
no future investments in their 
funds could be made and all previ-
OilS holdings had to be sold. 
According to U OP Treasurer 
David Russ, the university made 
almost $400 million in their 22-
year relationship with Sequoia 
Capital. This breakup could mean 
fewer profits for the univer icy in 
the venture capital indu!>try. 

Ilowever, pension plan mem-
bers and other univer ity retirees 
expre sed concern over where the 
money was going. Public scrutiny, 
C. U.E. and the Mtrcmy nus 
argued, would help avoid invest-
ments from being made based on 
personal ties instead of by :l com-
pany's performance.

For many San Diego residents 
and coUege students like 
Ben'Ade.ret, the beach is not just~ 
amusement but a way of life. 
Whether you are a pipe surfer, a 
frisbee enthusiast, or simply want 
to work on your tan, there is a 
beach for everybody. 

Although La Jolla Shore is the 
clo est beach to UCSD, there are 
many other worth exploring with-

from UCSD, one might notice that 
the beaches become quieter and

than large populations of touri ts.

To surfers, Blacks is known as 
one of the best beach breaks in the 
country, if not the world. With 
large winter sweils, surf enthusiasts 
are kept happy well into the cold

Many students appreciate 
Blacks Beach for its upreme surf-

With huge stretches of beach, tame 
waters, and close location to the

flock to them. La Jolla Shores is 
one of the most popular bc-dchcs in 

an Diego and, not surprisingly, a 
favorite among UC D students. 

"Shores is my favorite beach. It 
is so clo e to campus and still hasn 't

Q&A with outgoing 
UC President Atkinson 
Former head ofUC offers 

reflections on time in office 
By EVAN McLAUGHLIN 

Senior Staff Writer 

Richard C. tkinson stepped 
down Oct. I as pre ident of thc 

n iversity of Cali fornia after eigh t 
yea rs in office. Atkinson had served 
previously as UCSD ' chancellor 
until he was instated as UC 
President in 1995 . Editors from 
smdent newspapers around the UC 
system were invited to a k Atkinson 
some questions about h is experi-
ences at the university. 

Guardian: W hat was one of the 
hardest things you had to do as UC 
President? 

Atldnson: O ne of the hardest tasks 
has been charti ng a course fo r the 
university through the st.1te's cur-
rent budget cri is. The excellence 
of a education, and the excel-
lence of the C faculty, are unpar-
alle led. But the university took 

410 million in cuts in the 2003-04 
budget pa sed by the state, and 
we've had to make tough choices. 
To lessen the impact on mdents 
and the quality of their education, I 
made ure our rop priority was to 
protect the university'S academic 
quality by preserving the instruc-
tional budget. 

To fill the budget gap, we are 
taking deep cuts to non- instruc-
tional programs, borrowing 
mone}, to cover regular operations 
for the first time since the early 
I 990s, foregoing cost-of-living 
inc reases for fa culty and staff, 

de lay ing rhe open ing of UC 
Merced, and raising student fees 
by 30 percent. I know studems are 
worried about fees, and we regret 
having had to raise fees so much

out an increa e. 

Fortunately, fina ncia l aid will 
mitigate t he impact of the fee 
increa e for about 40 percent of 
U undergraduates. 

Perhap the most difficult parr 
is that we expect there wi ll be even 
more budget cutting n ext year. I 
hope the statc will recognize the 
value of h igher education to the 
people of alifornia and maintain 
a strong investment in the univer-
sity, so that we can minimize 
impacts on qual ity, access and 
affordabi lity. 

Guardian: alifornia's economy, 
according to outgoing-Gov. Gray 
Davi ' spokespeople, has been in 
crisis largely due ro its dependence 

n the tech ector for revenue. Do 
you sec C research playing a vital 
part in the economic turnaround 
and, if so, how? 

Atkinso n: I've always believed 
that California's economy is dri -
ven by new ideas, and much of the 
innovation in our state spring 
from campuses. Our tate's 
excellent system of higher educa-
tion, and in particular its research 
universities, has been a keyadvan -

Atkinson: Hope admission reforms payoff 
" I· COOKING CORNER

Ball Treats 

continued from page , , 
fi fth -larges t economy in the 
world . T he research and work-
force preparatio n that occur on 
our campuse are ab olutely cri ti-
cal to California . 

An example of our effort are 
the allform3 Institutes for 

cience and Innovation, where 
ome of the niversity of 

California's best cientists collabo-
rate with private industry in ways 
that help trigger economic growth. 
The In stitutes arc engaged III 
research 111 biomed ici ne, bi engi-
neering, nano ),s tems, telecommu-
nicatIOns and information technol-
ogy, and will continue to ma ke an 
Impact on the dally lives of all 
Californians. 

That 's why it's importan t for 
the tate to proceed carefully 
when considering budget cuts for 
higher educa tio n. We need to 
focus attenti on on expandi ng 
access to educa tiona l opportun i-
ties for students and providlllg 
them wi th the highest quali ty edu-
cation availabl e. 

Guardian: You officiall y tepped 
down on Oct. I , a week before the 
recall election. Old you, the leader 
of the most widely-heralded educa-
tion system m the world, consider 
running? 

Atkinson: Although I'm touched 
by the high esteem showed fo r the 
University of California, r did not 
consider running for governor. I do 
hope the state will benefit from 
insightful leader hip as a re ult of 
the recall election. 

Guardian: In July, the systemwide 
Academic Senate approved an 
amendment to the university's pol-
icy on academic freedom. This was 
criticized by some who argued that 

the policy revi sion would give 
more leeway to instructors who 
sought to make their classes more 
political. 

Given the concerns about poli-
tics in the cia room, and the big-
ger concern about the imbalance of 
power bet\veen 3 facul ty and tu-
dents, how do you answer the crit-
ics who contend that amending the 
academic freedom polley makes 
facu lty more unaccountable to stu-
dents, the univer ity and the gener-
• I pu blic a a whole? 

Atkinson: I don't think it has that 
Impact at all. T he revision to the 
statement on aca demic freedom 
doe not preclude the facu lty from 
havi ng a point of view, but it holds 
them to a high standard of academ-
ic and professional excellence. 1t 
makes clear that academic freedom 
should depend on the quality of the 
scholarshi p as measured by profes-
sional standards, not on the moti-
vation behind the production of 
the scholarshi p. 

The statement reft:r expl icitly 
to the "independence of mind" we 
seek to instill in students, and it 
emphasizes the importance of stu-
dents and facu lty in the classroom 
bei ng able to expre the wide t 
array of viewpoi nts within th e 
tandards of academic inquiry. In 

addi tion, a sepa rate document, th e 
Faculty Code of Conduct, con-
tai n even more specific language 
tha t wi ll still appl y, incl uding pro-
hi bition of the facul ty member 's 
use of his or her posi tion to coerce 
the judgment or conscience o f a 
student. 

Guardian: What do you feel will 
be your legacy as you step down? 

Atkinson: I think that is for others 
to judge. J have enjoyed my time as 

UC president, and I have been 
deeply honored by the opportunity 
to be involved in the education of 
California's best and brightest stu-
dents. 

I hop I will be remembered as 
a president who succeeded in pre-
erving the world-renowned acad -

emic quality of the University of 
Ca lifornia, for that is a very spe-
ci al treasure that Californians are 
fortun ate to have. I hope that our 
admissions initiatives will be 
remembered for expanding access 
to the University of California for 
the state's highest-achieving Stu-
dents from all walks of life. I hope 
that the national reforms in 
ad mis ions te ting wc in itiated 
wi ll send a powerful message to 
stu dents in hi gh school : Take 
challenging courses, do well in 
them, write a lot, and it will all 
payoff when you take the tests for 
college. 

And r hope that our various ini-
tiatives to expand the university'S 
impact on the California economy 
wi ll payoff in te rms of the health, 
well-bemg and quality of life of all 
the people in our state.

Soccer: Davey's two penalty 
kicks secure victory for UCSD 

continued from (XIge :10 
After the goal, the Tritons 

dropped back in a prevent 
defense, taking care of their lead . 
The Broncos' only shot in the 
final 13 minutes went wide, and 
UCSD improved to 9-4-1 overall, 
8-4-1 in the CCM. The TritOns 
are now on their way for their 
third division title in the past four 
years. 

"There was a lot on the line in 
this game and that's why we didn't 

, h" take very many c ances, 
Armstrong said. "J usually like. to 
play aggressive, but today we Just 
played and took the chances that 
we got." 

Although UCSD won the game, 
it suffered a severe blow early on 
when stable defender Luke Russell 
landed awkwardly after jumping to 
contend for a ball at the 25:46 
mark. Russell had to leave the 
game, and the initial repon o~ the 
injury was a stramed quadflcep. 

The team is awaiting more news on 
the injury. 

"That was a massivc blow for 
u ," Armstrong said . "If it's a seri-
ou injury, that will hurt us in a big 
way," 

Looking ahead, UCSD will 
host Chapman on Oct. 20 at 
Triton Soccer Stadium at 7 p.m. in 
a non-conference game. The 
Tritons will then ' go on the road 
next week to play Cal State San 
Bernardino on Oct. 25, and they 
will wrap up the regular season 
with a home match against Grand 
Canyon on Oct. I . . 

U SO will most Irkely lise 
these three games to keep every-
one fresh and work on playing as a 
team, an attribute that Armstrong 
has been stressing throughout the 
year. 

"We're very close," the coach 
said. "We're not quite there yet, 
but we're getting tighter a' the sea-
son goes." 

Water polo: Tritons able to 
contain a late Lions attack 

continued from page 20 
sun behind their backs. Petersen 
and Ellis were able to take full 
advantage of the: handical;>' 
Petersen scoring twice and EIlts 
once from the same posi tion, 
Hopkins scored his second goal of 
the game later in the quarter, he.lp-
ing to fend off the encroaching 
Lions. UCSD finished the quarter 
with little breathing room, 7-6. 

LMU jumped out in the fourth, 
scoring and again tying the game at 
7. The Tritons were quick to 
respond, as senior utility 1anhew 
Ustaszewski and Finegold scored 
back-lo·back goal , widening the 
gap to rwo, the widest advantage 
for either Ide of the entire l11atch. 

Finegold's goal, coming with 
one minute on the game clock, 
turned out to be the winning goal, 
as the Lions returned on their final 
offense to earn back one goal with 
40 econds remaining. 

"It didn't seem to make a big 
difference, but after they got that 

last goal, it turns oU[ that it mat-
tered," Finegold said. 

Hopkins scored his team-lead-
ing 39th and 40th goals of the sea-
son in the game. 

Players couldn't spc;cifica lly 
name any aspect of theIr game, 
offensively or defensively, that fell 
short enough to account for the 
dismal first half. Goalkeeper 
Colin McElroy SlOpped seven 
LM U shot attempts. The Tritons' 
defensive and offen ivc strategies 
were efficient, but not over-
whelming. 

UCSD improved It, rL'Cord I()

MONDAY, ocr BER 20, ZOOJ 
THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Volleyball: Tritons not 'wily' enough for Roadrunners 
conrinued from page 20 

The Trirons showed no sign of 
problems on Ocr. 16, since they 
defeated Cal State Stanislaus, 30-
17, 30-26 and 30-20. Middle 
blocker Kendra Canape and out-
side hitter Stacy Dunsmore posted 
13 kills and 12 digs apiece to share 
match-high honors in kills with 
the Warriors' Jackie Coudert. 
Setter Teresa Ohta led UCSD 
with 14 digs, while adding 44 
assists and guiding the offen e to a 
.277 hitting ptrcentage on the 
night. UCSD limited the Warriors 
to a .127 attacking percentage by 
putting up 65 digs on the evening 
and 10 total blocks, highlighted by 
Canape's three solo blocks. 

The Tritons then traveled 
south to take on the Roadrunners 
of Cal State Bakersfield. Led by 
reigning CCAA Player of the 
Week Jessica Slayton, the 
Roadrunners were prepared to 
play. After the Trirons opened the 

match with a 30-20 win, the 
Roadrunners roared back. 

After hitting just .116 in the first 
game, Cal State Bakersfield hit .250 
while UCSD dropped from the 
.395 mark it established in the first 

" 

game three, putting up 15 kills and 
putting the pressure on the 
Roadrunners, but in the end, 
UCSD's 10 hitting errors in the 
game were too much to overcome 
and Cal State Bakersfield prevailed 

30-27 to take a 2-1 
lead in the match . 

[Cal State 
Bakersfield] had a

Mistakes were 
common through-
out the match. 

"We had too 
many unforced 
errors and they 
really didn't have 
any," Canape said. 

game to an anemic 
. 038 in game two. 
The difference was 
more than enough 
to propel the 
Roadrunners to a 
30-20 victory of 
their own, and to 
level the match at 
one game apiece. 
Complacency may 
have been an issue 
for the Tritons 
after the first game. 

Even in game 
- Duncan Mcfarland. four it looked as if 

women's voUeyball coach UCSD might turn 
the match around 

as the Tritons prung out to a 9-4 
lead, but strong serving pushed the 
Roadrunners to a 9-1 run and a lead 
they would not give back. Game 
four went to the home side by a 30-
23 score and gave the Roadrunners 

"1 think we just kind of relaxed," 
Canape said. "[We thought] 'Its 
going to be like every other match 
we've played this year. We're going 
to kill them in three and go home. '"

the 3-1 victory in the match. 
The Roadrunners had 10 aces 

and eight serving errors, while the 
Tritons managed just three aces 
with 12 service errors. UCSD 
head coach Duncan McFarland 
credited his opponents' serving for 
disrupting the TritOn offense. 

"They had a phenomenal serv-
ing match where it seemed like all 
of their serves were bullets right at 
us," McFarland said. 

That serving was undoubtedly a 
factor in a passing performance the 
Tritons would prefer to forget. 

"There was no way we could 
run an effective offensive because 
our passing was just bad news," 
Canape said. 

There were still a few bright 
SpOts for the Tri tons, as they 
established a new eason-high in 
blocks with 16, led by middle 
blocker Katie Hogan'S four solo 
blocks and three block assists. 
Outside hi ner Lind ay Crandell 
had a strong match for UCSD, 
leading the team in both kJlls and 
digs with 15 in each category. 
Despite those areas, the rone of 
the trip back was fairly predictable. 

"The three-hour drive home 
was a pretty bad one," Canape 
said. 

The Tritons will have scant time 
before their Oct. 22 conference 
march at Cal State Los Angeles. 
However, McFarland knows that 
his team must fight through this dif-
ficult time of year. 

"It was a tough road trip. 
We've been on the road quite a 
bit the 13 t couple weeks, and I 
know our players have been 
stressed about missing so much 
class," he said. "We can't worry 
about being lucky or unlucky 
with the schedule. We just have 
to go out and play the matches 
we have and do the best that we 
can."

UCSD wins Homecoming match 

Anna MacMurdo/Guardion 
Bucking the Broncos: UCSD forward Tiago Venturi wrestles the ball away from a 
Cal Poly Pomona player In their Od 18 match at Tnton Soccer Stadium. 

By ANU KUMAR 
Associate Sports Ed itor 

In a back-and-forth game, the 
UCSD men', soccer team \1rtuallr 
cli nched the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association outh division 
ti tle with a 2 -I Win over rival Cal 
Poly Pomona on Oct. 1 at Triton

half. The Bronco cored in the 
41st minute on a goal by forward 

tephen Lopez. The core came 
after the Pomona nght forward 
eros ed the ball to the far po t, 
where it was knocked down. enior 
goalkeeper Jeremy Cookson could-
n't get his hands on the ball and 
Lopez kicked it into the back of the 

net after it came rolling to him. 
However, the 1-0 Bronco lead 

was short lived. UCSD struck back 
within 25 seconds to earn a penalty 
kick on the opposite side of the 
field. After sophomore forward 
Grant ishio went down in the 
box, Davey beat Cal Poly Pomona 
goalkeeper Tim Si k and scored in 
the lower left side of the goal on a 
penalty kick. 

The game remained tied for the 
rest of the first half and the initial 
parr of the second, like it would be 
heading into overtime. The ball 
was usually at midfield, and nei ther 
team managed to keep it in front of 
the opposing goal for a long period 
of time. 

The evenly matched showdown 
between the South division rivals 
suddenly took a turn in the Tritons' 
favor when UC D earned a free 
kick near the left corner of the field 
Just out ide of the penalty box with 
13 : 11 left. On the kick, the Triton 
offense got off a shot that would 
have gone in, bur Cal Poly Pomona 
midfielder Joe DeVito blocked it 
with his hand, resulting in an auto-
matic red card and penalty kick. 

Davey, who was named CCAA 
Player of the Week for Oct. 6 
through Oct. 12, took the penalty 
kick and went top helf with it, 
scoring in the upper left side of the 
net for his eventh goal of the ea-
son. 

ur ab olutely loved it," UCSD 
head coach Derek Armstrong said 
about Davey's choice to playa risky 
high shot on the penalty kick. "It 
wa going in all the way." 

See SOCCER, Page 18 

As the main attraction for 
Homecoming 2003, the Tritons 
played a conservative game and 
won on a pair of penalty kicks con-
verted by sophomore midfielder 
Matthew Davey. With the victory, 
UCSD opened up a nine-point 
advantage over the Broncos for 
first place In the CCM South with 
only twO conference games 
remaining.
