Atkinson, "Campus Finally Meet 
BY JEFF 

BERESFORD-HOWE 
New. Editor 

Richard Atkinson left 
campus yesterday afternoon 
after finishing five days of near 
constant exposure to the 
university community. 

"The chancellor-<lesignate's 
schedule left him tired and 
drained and "not as impresaive 
as he was in Los Angeles," 
search committee member, 
Peter Taersma said, but his 
rhetoric was upbeat and 
encouraging. 

"F9r density of faculty, this 
is the best university in the 
world," Atkinson said. "Better 
than Oxford, better than 
Harvard and better than 
Cambridge," he told the 
Associated Students Council. 
"I'm tremendously excited 
about coming here." 

Atkinson was especially 
proud of UCSD's reputation in 
research.

UCSD Praised 
In First Visit 

"You go anywhere in the 
world, to Japan, to West 
Germany, anywhere, and they 
know about UCSD. Every 
academic in the world knows 
about this university. It's only 
a few high school students and 
regional people who don't 
know how good the university 
is. 

Richard AtkinlOn (r.) and AS President Carlo. Montalvo met yesterday with the AS Council. 

"I don't kn~w about that," 
T Jersrna said, echoin, the 
sentiments of several faculty 
members, "but there's nothing 
wrong with having a 
chancellor who believes that." 

designed to meet the campus 
("everybody just wanted to see 
what he's like"), some news 
emerged from his various 
talks. 

- He announced Tuesday 
that Bernard Sisco, described 
by one department chairman 
as "the lad .. daity 01 the

would resign as Vice 
Chancellor of Administration 
effective July 1. 

with student search committee 
member Cheryl Dunnett, he 
was "very surprised" that 
there were no women on the

President Saxon to advise him 
on campus administration and 
promised to bring up the

intent of getting a woman 
faculty member on the 
committee. 

chancellors of academic 
affairs and administration will

department chainnan that he 
expected such an appointment 
by Nov. 1 after a nationwide 
search and the AS that he 
expected a local man or 
woman to be appointed befOre

- He said he would bring 
only one administrator with

Foundation, an assistant who While Atkinson's visit was - After a sharp exchange

on UCSD in particular, and universities 
in genera'. 

"I'm juat appalled that only 30 percent 
of the ltudents who enter graduate from 
this campus. I don't know what causes 
that, but it's obviously IOrrJething we have 
to examirJe. It's the most important 
problem facing the university." 

.. 

"The candidates for chancellor 
probably should have visited campus. Let 
me tell you, though, what ~a~ in ~y 
case. David Saxon ViSIted me tn 
Washington on Feb. 26 and asked me if I 
would be interested in the job if there were 
seven or eight candidates left. I said no. 

"Then he said, 'Would you be 
interested if there were OrJe or two 
candidates left.' I said I'd think about it. A 
couple of days later he called and said 
there were two candidates left and I laid I 
was interelted. 

"If I had been asked to participate in an 

,extended search, I would have said no, 
and I would have been a lilde upset if it 
got too 'political, because then whoever is 
selected hu to live. in that environment." 

"I have an incredibly strong 
commitment to affinnative action. In four 
years (at NSF), I haven't slipped in 
recruiting minorities. 

"There is an increasing uneasiness 
about the sixties and the early seventies. 
"There is a concern that we weren't worried 
enough about the quality of education. 
More women and minorities were drawn 
into social sciences, with a bad job 
market, than the natural sciences. 

"I am against programs which aim to 
draw minorities only into the social 
sciences. 

"I wouldn't want to see minority 
programs that aie in some sense seen as 
more closely tied to the aocial sciences," 
he laid. 

(While Atkinson did not sped/icall., 
mention the college, Third Provost 
Joseph Watson M. been extensively 

criticized in rite student community for 
supporting just such a philosophy.) 

.. 

"I think my main concerns about the 
university are houling for students and 
faculty, the level of support for graduate 
students and the undergraduate 
program."

"The world of the faculty member is not

- He disclosed that he i, in 
the process of preparing a 
report for President Carter on 
the future of science and 
engineering research in the 
country. "After I have 
completed that report and the 
NSF' budget, I will be 
absolutely free of obligations 
to anything except the 
university," he said. The 
report is due July 1, the same 
day he will alsume the 
chancellorship here. 

- He said he would return 
several times before July 1. . 
AS President Carlos 
Montalvo said yesterday the 
first of those visits would 
probably be in two weeks. In 
the meantime, Atkinson said, 
anyone from the univer~tf 
traveling to Washington, DC 
is welcome to step in and talk 
with him. 

- Proposition 9 is a serious 
threat to the university, he 
said, but handling its 
repercussions is the job of 
Chancellor MeFJroy until July 
1. "I don't know much about 
it," he said about the initiative, 
"and Dr. Me fJroy will be 
chancellor for the first month 
after the election."

Students 
Have Ideas 
For Cuts 

BY JOHN HONDROS 
~e Newa Editor 

Convinced that tuition is not 
inevitable, UC student 
lobbyists are taking steps to 
defeat President David 
Saxon's plan to oUset 
Proposition 9 budget cutbacks 
by imposing tuition on the 
university's 120,000 students. 

Along with encouraging UC 
students to write letters to state 
legislators and the Board of 
Regents voicing opposition to 
Saxon's proposal, the Student 
Lobby is currently in the 
process of finalizing a draft ~st 
of alternatives to tuition . 

The alternatives, to be 
submitted to Saxon before this 
month's special Regent's 
meeting on tuition, include 
consolidating academic 
programs, increasing faculty, 
work loads and selling excess 
university-owned properties. 

The letter will go before the 
Student Body PresidfOnt's 
Council this weekend for

Have you ever wondered about the 
shoes in the road? You're usually ina 
car when you lee them. It'. alway. a 
single ahoe. Often it lies in the very 
center of the street, firmly stepping 
crOll the painted divider. As to kind 
or d ... , it may be a brown scuffed 
baby shoe, a sandal, or more likely an 
Addu·.1yIe lneaker or a slap. 

"Fane," you ~ay. "I've teen theae 
Ihoea and I coUld have told you all 
that. What should concern us is 
where the cuned things come from." 

T eke heed; the word cwaed i. the 
key. When laaw my fint ahoe in the 

My immediate reaction 
was that its owner 
had been run over 

road, it .hocked me. I was very 
yauns, gradeachool age, and wu 
doubtJes. being driven somewhere by 
my mother. Anyway, there it lay, 
along the edge of the road, 811 it had 
been catapulted by a great force. My 
immediate and morbid reaction W81 
that ita owner had been run over, and 
the shoe dropped by the fa.t-moving 
dean-up crew. Either that or the 
penon had literally flown through the 
air from the horrible impact, and the 
shoe had been tom from hi. foot. In 
abort, thole abandoned .hoes meant 
death. 

Marcia Brisbois i. a graduate 
student in literature a' UCSD. 

These idea. gave rile to many 
complicated que.tion.. What 
happened when the person got to the 
hospital and the ambulance people or 
someone saw that the victim had but 
a single shoe? Did'anyone go back to 
look for it? Or what if the casualty, in 
a rare incident of recovery and 
diamiual from the hospital was issued 
his clothing only to find that he was 
one shoe short? 

A. I grew older I continued to see 

There's a Story 
Behind That 
Shoe In The 
Road 

BY MARCIA BRISBOIS 
the shoes, but new speculations as to 
their origin entered my mind. Very 
likely someone was dangling hi. or 
her foot out the window, as we kid. 
did when we travdled cro .. country, 
and the .hoe merdy fell off. I tried this 
leveral times, but alway. made sure 
that the .hoe was tighdy laced so I 
wouldn't 101e it. I wondered why 
whoever loat the .hoe didn't ask the 
driver to .top and go back to get it. 
However, when I thought of the 
nwnber of small shoes, and the 
nwnber of driving fathers like my own 
who wdcomed the "one more thing 
and I'm going to .top the car and tet 
out and .pank you," I .topped 
considerin, that point. 

As I said, I never Io.t a.hoe in the 
road, nor has anyone I'm acquainted 
with. I once lost a ballet .hoe in a 
Chula Vi.ta parking lot, which was 
unpleasant because I searched for the 
.hoe for day., sure that I was losing 
my mind before it ever occUrred to me 
what had happened. But that still 
doesn't explain satisfactorily the 
.hoe. in the smack-dab middle 01 the 
street. 

lbe reason it's on my mind i. 
because a friend and I were driving 
home from school not long ago, and 
we saw a perfect specimen - athletic 
.hoe in the center of the road. Further 
up the hill wu another, leas precisely 
placed near the shoulder. I expreaaed 
my mental turmoil at seeing the 
damned thi"fJs. He reaponded with a 
cheerful explanation. the .hoes are 
the trademark of the White Wahila. 
For thole of you who, like me, never 
attended a heaviJ)' _forested lummer 
camp, the White Wahila is half man, 
half woH and often vi.its Indian 
village., devouring a person or two 
and leaving a pair of mocca .. ina 
outaide of the abode. 

My reaction to the White Wahila 
story is that I} it only accounts for 
shoes in pairs and 2) that it was 
fabricated by someone who needed to 
explain an extra pair of unfamiliar 
footgear to a returning family 
member. 

This discuaaion seems to have 
firmly planted the consciousness of 
shoes in the road in my friend's mind. 
Which brings up an important point 

I wondered why whoever 
lost the shoe didn't ask 
the driver to go back 
and get it 

- until you activdy cultivate an 
awareneas of the phenomenon, 
you're apt to .pend your entire life 
milling out on it. Because .hoea in 
the road are like weeds in bloom 
along a bu.y freeway - you just 
don't notice them. 

But back to my friend. Today the 
phone rang and when I an.wered it he 
said, "You're not going to believe 
thi.. I was driving into Dd Mar, and 
there was a shoe in the road." 

"In the middle?" I asked hopefully. 
"No, no over in the right lane. Doea 

that count?" 
"Heck, yes." 
"Well, anyway, I kept driving and 

then there was another shoe." 
"Were they a pair?" 
"Yeah, they were. But here's the 

best part - I kept driving and there 
was a sweatshirt in the middle of the 
street." 

.... 

Ha ve you ever wondered about the 
c10thea in the road?

WASHINGTON - Presi.

with Egyptian President 
Anwar Sadat yesterday with 
words of support for the 
Palestinians but no apparent

That, Carter said, will

Carter strested, however, 
that there must be "a

Students Oppose Tuition With Hit List of Possible Cuts 
Cunlinuecl from page 1 
approval. 

"If the message of Jarvis is 
right, it is necessary that the 
w1iversity cut back, and not 
that the .tudents pay 10 the 
university doean't have to cut 
back," said Linda Saba, AS 
external affaira comrniuioner. 

"If we think about budget 
cuts then we have to think 
about every alternative, and 
not necessarily accept the idea 
that students can make up 
two-thirds 01 the deficit," Sabo 

said. 
Sabo said it will be 

necessary to "share the pain." 
"One-third of the deficit 

should be offset from the 
students in lOme form, and not 
necelllaray in the fonn 01 
tuition; one-third from the 
faculty; and one-third from the 
administration,:' she argues. 

Alternatives in the draft 
letter, which amount to more 
than $130 million in 
reduction., include: 

- FJiminating duplication 

of progranu among campus-
es . 

- Increasing the tenured 
faculty teaching load from five 
to six courses per academic 
year. This 20 percent increase 
in classroom teaching 
workload amounts to about 
four hours more work per 
week and could be realized, 
the SBPC claims, by reducing 
the amount of time the faculty 
is expected to devote to 
research. 

This approach would allow 

the university to offer virtually 
the sarne number of courses 
with about 16.7 percenl fewer 
faculty. 

- Selling excess lands held 
by the university which are not 
an integral part of the 
academic program. 

- Adopting a four-day 
work week, which would result 
in an overall ,a1ary &avingl in 
theJeneral campus in.truct-
ion programs alone 01 $54

could answering "questions 
that were sometimes too 
general and sometime. too 
specific." 

Atkinson avoided answer· 
ing specific questions, and 
claimed ignorance of 
university mechanics - e.g., 
the tenure and budgeting 

processes, student involve· 
ment in decision-making and 
other areas.

Two mistakes were made in the AS candidates list 
published in Tuesday's issue of The Doily Guardian. We 
misspelled Dick Semerdjian's name by using a g instead of a j, 
and left off the lut part of Jules Bagneris' name entirely. 

We apologize for any inconvenience caused by the errors.
