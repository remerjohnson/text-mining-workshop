Biology Dept. 
Proposes 
Restrictions 
CRUNCH: Committee 
con ider limiting tudent 
enrollment by 30 percent 
By Julia Kulla-Mader 
Staff Writer 

~::t:> 

Citing massive overcrowding, Ihe UCSD 
biology depanmenl has proposed gradually 
decreasing Ihe number of biology majors on 
campus by 30 percent 

The deparlment plans to reduce Ihe number 
of biology majors over a live-y,ear period by 
imposing a minimum-G PA requirement and by 
reslricting enrollmenl in upper-divi slon courses 
10 biology majors only, 

Only students wilh a GPA of 2,75 or grealer 
"in a defined set of screening courses will be 
granted admission 10 the major and permitled 
to enro ll in upper-division cla~ses," the depart-
ment s propol>al staled. 

Those screening courses will he Malh I A 
and 18 (or 20A and 20B); Phy 'ics IA (or 2A): 
Chemistry 6A and 6B; and Biology I and 2 (or 
I and 3). 

According 10 the departmenl 's pr posal, 
which is currcntly bcforc thc Academic Senate 
Representati ve A.~~embly':. om millee on 
Educational Policy (CEP), the number of biol-
ogy majors on campus has increased from 
2,300 10 3,900 over the last live years, The 10lal 
undergraduale-student populalion at UCSD has 
risen by fewer than 100 students in the same 
time period. 

Although 25 percent of all undergraduate 
sludents are now biology majors, the proposal 
claims that the department 's faculty and sup-
port funding have not increased accordingly. 

The committee will debate the plan at a 
meeting this Friday. 

Last night, the A sociated Studenls (A.S,) 
voted II 10 one, with one abslention, 10 
approve a resoluti on written by A,S, 
Commissioner of Academic Affairs David 
Freeman that urged CEP to delay deciding Ihe 
fate of biology majors until the fall. 

Urging Ihe council to approve the resolu-
tion, A.S, President Sou ley Diallo said he is 
con'cerned that CEP has not asked for sludenl 
input. 

" It is imperative that we submit our inpul on 
thi s issue," Diallo said. "Especially because il 
wasn ' t asked for. "

Clinton's UCSD VISit is an 
'Honor for the Class of 1997 

Slowly but surely, details about President Clinton's 
upcoming visit to UCSD are coming out. The latest news 
is that Mr, Clinton will speak at an all-campus com-
mencement ceremony on RIMAC field at 10 a.m. on 
Saturday, June 14, The White House has announced that 
the president 's speech will be a major policy address . Mr. 
Clinton wi ll outline his vision of the chal lenges and 
opportunities posed by increasing cultural diversity as 
America enters the 2 1 st century. 

Graduating seniors of a more conservative bent might 
be tempted to gripe at the prospect of being subjected to 
political views contrary to their own during their com-
mencement. There might even be a few non-conserva-
tives who are upset that politics of any kind will sully 
their graduation experience: 

These concerns, however. are far outweighed by the 
potential historical signifi cance of the president's 
address. It was in a commencement address to students at 
Westminster College in Missouri that Winston hurchi ll 
firs t coi ned the term "iron curtain ," thus setting the stage 
for the connict that was the old War. Moreover, in a 
commencement address just las t week to students at 
Morgan State University in Baltimore, Mr. Clinton com-
mitted the nation to findi ng an AIDS vaccine by the year 
2007. 

Besides the potential hi storica l significance of Mr. 
Clinton's addn:ss. we should also not forget that the uni -
versity 'should not make itself immune to ideology. While 
it is trut: that scholarship should follow only where rea-
son - not ideology - leads. the university should wel-
come all points of view. albeit in a criti cal fashion . 

We welcome Mr. Clinton 's prospective visi t and wish 
nothing but the best for his audience - UCSD's Class of 
1997. 

NSF Grant is a Good First 
Step Toward Internet-II 

Last week, the National Science Foundation (NSF) 
awarded a $3.8 mi Ilion Contract to a consortium of 
Californi a universities (both public and private) for the 
development of a state-wide network that would be up to 
100 times faster than the current Internet. The CaIREN-2 
project will initially be used as a fast, stable connection 
for remote research and communication. 

aIREN-2 is part of a larger national project ca lled 
Internet II, an effort among the nation 's leading universi-
ties and businesses to build a next-generation network 
geared toward educational and research applications. 

A significant advantage of the CaIREN-2 project is that 
instead of having the federal government provide the 
majority of research funding. the universities and private 
corporations themselves wi ll have to contribute signifi -
cant amounts of money and effort to make thi s new stan-
dard succeed. 

We applaud the NSF and the universities and business-
es involved for their work in developing a new informa-
tion infrastructure that others can use to build the infor-
marion superhighways of the future.

MISOGYNY CONTINUES TO 
PERVADE SOCIETY 

COMMENTARY: Despite the substantial gains feminism has 
achieved, society still requires women to acquiesce to prescribed roles

Society hates wOlllen. It des-
perately needs u~, bUI it hates us. 
It subordinate~ us, tries to keep us 
away from each other and tries to 
keep us from running things -
out of fear that we would do 
things l'OITCct ly. 

It hates some women more 
than others - women of color, 

Yet. women who refuse to acquiesce to the social 
mores of femininity, deli ned by giggling and nirting. are 
called "impenetrahle bitches." Those of us who raise our 
voices in protest for our rights are branded "feminazis." 
We are then denied the tenure-track position, th<: raise or 
the promotion . 

It used 10 be that strong-willed women were accused 
of witchcraft. and burned at the stake for refusing to be 
subord inated. Today, we are eilher demoted or we bruise

The plight is worse for women of

women, to name a few it hates the 
most. 

Now, when I say "society," I'm 
referring to both men and women. 
We females have been taught to hate 
ourselves, to hate the bodies that we 
have and 10 intemalile the male 
ga/.e. 

We are raped, objectified and 
marginali/,ed. We arc diswuraged 
from studying the sc iences and shep· 
herded into homemaking. We carry 
the burden of lile in our wombs, and 
yet we are to ld abortion is not a 
woman 's choice. 

When we ask for a Women 's 
Center. we are told to stop being 
selfish in promoting the needs of a 
"special interest group." And when 
we retaliate against the blatant injus-
tice, we are accused )1' "thinking 
with our emotions." and n<J.with our 
heads. 

"Oh, is it that time of month 
agai n?" we are asked.

Who needs equal 
rights or an 
executive position 
when you have your 
own long, skinny 
cancer sticks? 

The woman hoping for a promo· 
tion must learn to "play the game": 
she has to swallow her pride and 
demurely subordinate herself. If she 
steps out of her place to tread the 
line line between the "90s woman," 
who maintains the soft edges of her 
femininity while striving for the top, 
and the "power-hungry bitch," who 
threatens to break up the old boys' 
club, she is deemed a troublemaker. 

When the men gulTaw, she mu st 
learn to dismiss the sexist jokes, 
although she is standi ng in the same 
room . She has to tum a deaf ear to 
raucou diseu sions of "Bay watch"

has to close her eyes. block her ears 
and hut up. She is given an added bonus if s.he sm iles a 
lot and wears short skirts, crossing and uncrossing her 
bare legs. She also has to play hardball; the 90s woman 
must continue to compete with her male counterparts -
even though the urn:omfortable environment places her 

at a disadvantage and tilts the playing lield against her 
succe ·s. 

When privileged and tenured profess rs make unwel-
come passes at u , we have to simply smile and edge 
away; after all , it is our responsibility I10t to "encourage" 
such behavior. But when we cry "sexual hara~smcnt." we 
are accused of being "uptigh l," or nol knowing how to 
have a little "fun."

DISPELLING GREEK MYTHS 
ByD ... Sw ..... y 
Senior Staff Wnrer 

Flash back 10 Europe. hundreds of 
YC.1rs ago. TIle reigning powers of the 
time - intent on exploring the 
world's oceans - theoril.cd th~t the 
world wa.\ Ilat. Of .:oursc. they had 
little ha.\is on which to suhslanliale

Of course, the subje~ t of dispute is 
hardly as menial as the shape of the 
Eanh. We're lalking about a real issue 
here. amely, the Greek system here 
at good or UCSD. 

We've all heard the deri sive 
ridi~ule that 's been heaped on it cour-
tesy of outsiders. But lei 's face it, 
these people are in no position to cri t-
idle. Most likely, said judgment 
stem from the mbid jealousy har-
bored by those relying solely on mea-

extracurricular m;tivitics. And who 
C;IO hlame them? Even the hardiest or

Being such an individual, I realize 
Ihat it is up 10 me to invalidate the 
abhorrent myths that run roughshod 
across our stagnant campus so that

Let me point out that Ihe Illere fact 
Ihat I'm penning thi ' comlllelliary

members of Ihe Greek-lettered mass

COACHES DESERVE RESPECT 
Editor: 

I have to say that. fo r the IIlllSt 
part , I agree that coachc, are 
f'inally gctling a li lli e respect 
(" BA Coache ' + Ca~ h = 
Respecl ," Glla rdian , May 15, 
19(7). I am Just disappo inted that 
it has 10 come in the form of 
money. Coaches rea II y aren't 
respected nowadays, which is 
evi dent from the firing sprees 
that cluhs go through at the end 
of each and every sport s season. 

owadays, I would say that if a 
coach gets to keep his joh, that' 
respect enough . A raise is ici ng 
on the cake! 

I just really think that profes-
sional sport s has its priurities all 
screwed up . The bOll om line is all 
that mailers anymore. Look at the 
whole Don elson/Chris Webber 
fiasco . Nelson was one of the 
most brilliant minds in basket -
ball. and some punk who goes on 
the DL due to a hangnail can ge t 
him to leavc. and the Warri ors 
didn't do a thing. Webber was 
obv iou sly more important mone-
tari Iy than elson was as a bas-
tion o f basketball knowledge and 
integrity. I ;.till despise Webber 
for that. 

Then Ihere are the Lakers. De l 
Harri s, Ihe man who put the 
L"kers back together, has hi s 
emp loyment statu in jeopard y 
because ick Van Exel has a poor 
shOWing In the play ff~ and 
needs \omeonc to blame. These 
bratty profe:.sional athl e tes Ihink 
they can do whatever they want. 
and do ,0 because the owners lei 
Ihem get away with it. 

I rea ll y have to wonder ahou l 
the whole Brian Hill incident.

Penny Hardaway. the big mar-
quee name, the revenue bringer, 
gets the coac h fired si mply 
because he doesn' t like the 
coach 's style of play. Where is 
the in tegrilY here? The Magic 
went to the final s on that sty Ie of 
play! Now all of a sudden, they 
aren ' t doing well, they need an 
excuse for thei r lack of perfor-
mance. "The coach did it, " they 
cry. and the management comes 
running . "Oh, poor ba bie~ . Is the 
coach not doing things how you 
want? I'm sorry. Whaddaya say 
after I fire him we aliIHo out fo r 
ice crea mT I can Just pic ture 
Penny popping his thu mb out of 
his mouthju~t long enough to ~ay 
"OK." 

I really think th at Ihe coach is 
rarely wrong. especia ll y at the 
1 BA levcl. Whether Ihe coach 
diagra ms a givc-and-go or a dou-
ble-screen-threc-cut-Iob , it ' s the 
players who have 10 execute it. 
Ii 's the players who have to se ll 
the rake, Ihe players who have to 
hit the shot. 

So why does the eoach pay for 
the players' ineptitude'! Money. 
That 's why I have to di sagree 
with Jonah Nisenson a little. It 's 
nice that coaches are getting a lit -
tle respecl even if it is with dollar 
signs. but what message does that 
send? There is no longer a pure-
ness in professional sports. The 
coaches were the la ·t ones who 
weren't lai nled by green. who did 
their job because Ihey loved it 
and wanted to teach and pas~ on 
their knowledge, and be chal-
lenged . Yes, they ge t their 
respect , hul at what price'!

Of course. above all. we are here

KOAlA Is VALID PuBLICATION 
Editor: 

After reading Michael Manin 's 
article "Why the Koala Sucks," I 
feel the need to come to the defense 
of one of the greatest forms of 
expression that UCSD ha<; to offer. 

Does the Koala offend? Ye~ . 
Does it harass') Perhaps. Does it deal 
with "important" issues? Rarely. But 
docs it make me laugh~ Hell yes l 
The reason why UCSD has such a 
pathetic social environment is 
because there are so many people 
here that take academics so serious-
ly that they forget to live. Loosen up! 
It 's not healthy to be so stressed out 
all the time. 

As for the question of whether 
the Koala can be considered joumlll-

i~m, well. why not? It 's just different 
from what most of us arc u~ed to. 
With all the dry, bland, conventional 
tuff that 's out there, the Koala is 

refreshing. And perhaps it's true that 
some of us haven't outgrown toilet 
humor. But does that make us lesser 
people, poophcad') 

I can understand how Mlme of 
you might not want your dollars 
funding the Koala. but guess what. I 
don 't want my fee funding Ik 
Fronteri:a and the w.w Indicawr! 
I've never read those puhlications 
nor do I plan on ever reading them. 
However. I'm not complaining 
because I know that some of my 
money goes toward things that I do 
enjoy reading. I pay for some of your 
junk, you pay for some of my junk. 
We're evcn. 

And Michael, if you thin" that 
the Koala personals have been 
vicious in the past, just wait until 
next issue.

UCSD Represses 
Radical Journalism 
Editor: 

Far he it from me to criticize a 
lellow joulllalist's work. but I draw 
the line at the kind of knee-jerk fun -
damentalism used to judge the 
Koala in Michael Martin 's May 27 
article, "Why the Koala Sucks." 

The most fundamentally ridicu-
lous assumption that you make in 

GREEK: 
UCSD social life is 
found in fraternities 
Continued from page 7 
scenario: rather than being a replace-
ment for the soc ial life you had 
before, the Greek system is a supple-
ment. You get the best of both worlds. 
"WIuIt? You think I'm ..... of 
money or 1OIMtIIInC" 

Everything in thi s life that is good 
is worth paying for. 

TIle fact of the matter is. yeah. 

your article is the assumption that 
you, as a member of the GlIardial/ , 
arc in a morally superior po~ition ; 
lhat the GlIardian has the moral 
right to criticizc the Koala . You 
write that "the Koala does not real-
ly deal with i~sues ." So I assume 
that you're basing your position of 
moral superiority on the fact that 
the GI/ardian follows the form of a 
standard newspaper, and that it is 
aligned with what you describe as 
"Berkeley's tradition of exploring 
and debating so<:io-politicai 
philosophi.:s." In comparison, the 
Koala is only a rather juvenile 
humor paper whose content you 
describe as "demeanlingj every 
aspect of life that everyone has 
ever found holy." Your assumption 
then, is that the Koala is bad and 
the Guardian is good. 

I question what you define as the 
"positive" aspects of academic and 
social life at UCSD. You have found 
other alternative puhlications like 
Vos Fmnleri:a and the Lasr 
Indicaror to be " legitimate" . 
TIleref re, you. arc only delining a~ 
"positive" and "Iegitimate" paper~ 
whose ideologies lie along a very 
rigid liheral political position. 

Becau~e the KouhI ha\ no \tatcd 
political position. I assume that you 
regard it as wnservative. You cite 
the UCSD tradition of the I 960s. 
where radicals like Angcla Davis, 
Herbert Mancuse and Roger Revelle 
sought stand in opposition to the 
repressive con ervative power sys-
tel11s. You deplore the newspapers to 
"live up to the legacy 01" (i .e. - fall 
in line with) radicals of the 19605. 

In no way am I showing disre-
spect for the actions of Davis, 
Mancuse. Revelle or others who 

Greek orgs charge dues each quarter 
to keep the gears nmning, but paying 
dues is not like paying UCSD fees. 
You actually feel like the money is 
coming back to you. The dues come 
baek to you in the form of cool events 
that you actually want to attend. 

I've realized that in many ways, 
going Greek actually saved me 
money! If I hadn 't rushed, I'd proba-
bly be losing close to a 100 hucks a 
quarter in gas money driving home 
all of the time, because I'd have no 
de 'ire to stick around. For those 
weekends stuck here, I'd be shelling

rebelled against the repressive con-
servative system of the 1960s. This 
is not an issue of liberalism or con-
ervati sm. The challenges that faced 

radicals in the 19605 and the 'hal-
lenges that face U ' in the 1990s are 
not the same. The only thing worse 
than repressive conservative systems 
are those who would replace them 
with repressive liberal systems. You 
have written that "1 love thi s 
school." Good for you. I don't share 
your sentiment. and thai is precisely 
because the political climate at thi s 
school is repressive. 

You find the Koala offensive. 
Too bad. I nnd your fledgling moral 
superiority offensive, I find the 
repressi ve political climate you sup-
port offensive and I find your article 
offensive. If the Koala is juvenile. 
then let it be juvenile. Somehow I 
find the Koala more lifelike and rad-
ical than another political paper full 
of articles thai strain to live up to a 
legacy that has long since past. If 
you don't see UCSD as a repressive 
political climate, either liberal or 
conservative. then I question your 
joumalistit: integrity. Ifyou're such a 
radical, it 's good to have at least that.

Miller IS wid Iy known for his

facilitates student panicipation. 

In recognition of his deter-
mined promotion of primary- and 
secondary-school education, soci-
ology Professor Hugh Mehan 
received the distinguished-teach-
ing award for his work with the 
Teacher Education Program. 

Mehan was in Sweden helping

search for other ways to handle the 
large number of biology majors at 
UCSD, and that the commi ttee 
include students in its discussions. 

Academic Senate Manager 
Bonnie Horstmann said the com-
mince will most likely make a 
dedsion on the proposal's fate in 
fall quarter. 

According to biology depart -
ment chair Stcphen Hedrick, no 
current students would he affected 
if the proposed changes are imple-
mented. 

All students currently enrolled 
in the university would have the 
opt'ion of declaring a biology' major 
at any time throughout their acade-
inic careers. The proposed changc 
would first affect students entering 
in fall 1998. 

Hedrick said overcrowding is 
the driving force behind the pro-
posal - most current undergradu-
ate biology classes contain around 
300 people. 

The nrst and second most popu-
lar majors at UCSD are in the hiol-
ogy department. General Biology, 
with 1,669 students, is the mo~t 
popular major at UCSD. 
Biochemistry and Cell Biology is 
the second most .popular major, 
with 975 sl udents. 

Hedrick said .one of the disad-
vantages of having so many biolo-
gy majors is that there is not 
enough lab space. 

"It's heen hard to have largc 
labs," Hedrick said. "We can't pro-
vide quality biology education 
without experimental education." 

Hedrick sa id the universi ty is 
faced with lWO main questions 
when deciding what to do with so 
many hiology majors - 'first , 
whether UCSD has the ability to 
hire additional faculty. 

The second question i . "do we 
want 50 percent of students on thi s 
campus to be biology majors'!" 
Hedrick ~aid . 

Hedrick noted that UC Irvine 
has. a screening process for biology 
major, and that the average GPAs 
of pre-hiology majors increased 
after the cutoffs were implemented. 

However, psychology depart-
ment chair David Swinney sent a 
letter to CEP chair Ellen Comisso. 
a professor of political science, 
questioning what would happen to 
the "biology castoffs." 

"Our major concern has to do 
with the intent of Biology' plan to

ed') castoffs to the : rest' of us' at

A ccording to 26· year.old lead 

singer and renowned icon of femilline 
pulchritude Gwen Stefani , iI's j ust a 
"loser band," In fact , Stefani her!>c lf 
has plastered "Dork" stickers all over 
her vanity case in an effort to deny the 
chic the band has attained with the 
remarkable double.platinum success of 
its third album, Tragic Kingdom. How· 
ever, try as they might, the members of 
No Doubl - Stefani, bassi I Tony 
K anal, drummer Adrian Young and 
guitari st Tom Dumunt - cannot 
escape Ihe fact that they are currently 
one of the hollesl acb going, 

Perhaps they arc just having trouble 
adjusting to Ihe limelight. After all, No 
Doubt sweat , played and sang iL~ way 
through nine years of obscurity, sever· 

al line-up,. a tirst album that wa ' a 
commercial railure fur Interscope and a 
second alhum the band had to self pro· 
ducc in a garage before tinally striking 
platinum with Tragic Killgdom. So 
uncomfortable arc the musicians with 
their new· fuund fame that Kanal and 
Siefani have yet to move uut of their 
respecti ve parenL~' houses, and Young 
and Dumon( occupy small homes in 
Long Beach. 

"I know Ihat the mu 'ic industry and 
people that li sten to music these days 
arc prctty rickie, and Ihis may be our 
'one-hit wonuer ' and it may be gone 
tomorrow, but wc ' re going to have a lot 
of fun in the meantime," Dumont said 
in an interview wi th Ax('es,~ Magazint' , 
"Ninety·nine percent of 

whether they are telling the truth or 
not. want tu make a living playing 
mu sic. Il's nol about selling out. II's 
aboul having a little fun for awhi le and 
not having 10 work anOlher job and gel· 
ting to play music aU day long, every 
day." 

One docs not usually picture glam. 
orous rock stars living al home with the 
folks, but Nu Doubt is not a typical 
band, Because many people firsl heard 
of No Doubl due to massive airplay 
alloted lo single from Tragic Kingdom 
such as "Just a Girl" and " Don ' t 
Speak." they automatically assumed 
that Nu Doubt i ~ an overnight success. 
Nothing could he rurlhcr from the 
truth .

KARP 
KARP 

-..... 

The same mud-metal lunatics 
who pounded out "Mustaches 
Wild" and "Sup lex" have resur-
rected to deliver even more unho-
liness on their self-titled, third full -
length release on Olympia, 
Wash.'s K Records. Although the 
K line-up traditionally features 
fantastic, clean-sounding sensa-
tions such as the Softies, Dub Nar-
cotic Sound Systern and the Make-
Up, KARP's intrusion is sure to 
generate commotion. 

Just as expected, KARP's lat-
est release is sure to send those 
few remaining Metallica-worship-

pi nglMegadet hers running home to 
their mommies in tears. The sounds 
generated by this Tumwater, Wash. 
trio is not to be tackled by light -
weights. Their heavy sound is an 
almagam of sludge/grind-core 
played in such a loud and hectic 
fashion that it will jar your internal 
organs, while KARP's songs are 
laced with the pure, maniacal 
insanity that only KARP can 
administer. 

Take a long deep breath and 
make sure that you have your box-
ing gloves on before you jump into 
the ring with KARP - or else you 
might come home sporting curlers, 
a Catholic school girl uniform or 
maybe even a prom dre s!

TOla/ly Re-W;red No. II pro-
vides no big surprises - ju~t mel-
low gold. It provides a dub-heavy 
reggae groove that jams from start 
to finish . Gregory Isaac's and 
Mother's "ElIrth 9 to 5 Dub" shines 

a~ the best trll(;k, at times throwing 
in the spacey effects which help to 
gi ve acid jazz its name. 

Another gem is Dread Flim-
stone and the Family's Instrumen-
tal track, "Sound Dub Stalker." It 
instantly sets you in the mood to 
be sipping margaritas beachfront 
on Sunday around sundown - the 
band just jamming and throwing in 
the occasional quirk . 

The final highlight is Madrak 's 
"Madrak Dub," another instru-

Faith No More 
Album of the Year 

SluMllprl1l 

-•• 
San Francisco's Faith No More 

is one of those bands that are 
impossib le to categorize. With 
thrash-riff guitars, groove bass, 
hard-rock drums. eerie keyboards 
and the ranting screams of lead 
singer Mike Patton, the band has 
prided itself on organized chaos. 

With the release of Album of tile 
Year, the band's Iifth LP, it is 
apparent that Faith No More's 
internal connicts have caught up 
with them. Following the departure 
of former guitarist Jim Martin (who 
gave us the famous "Epic" riffs) in 
1994, the band nearly broke up -
over and over again.

Albl/m of tile Year h(lS little, if 
no cohesion. "Stripsearch" is the 
band's handwagon allempt at elcc-
tronica. Behi nd keyboardist Roddy 
BOllum's well -drafted keyboard 
string , an electronic drum track 
mirror Mike Bordin's real drums. 
"Last Cup of Sorrow," slated (0 be 
the album's first single, is, well -
boring. Although the track is clas-
sic Faith No More, led by Pallon 's 
garbled whisper. , it goes nowhere. 

The band should stick to what 
works for it (1992' Angel Dust, 
1995 's King "-ora Day, Fool Fora 
Lifetime). Unfortunately for Fai th 
No More, A/blllll of the Year is nny-
thing but that.

STONE: 
STP's performance 

. . 

was impreSSive 
Continued from page 13 
"Louie, Louie." 

* 

Rounding out the show with 
eight more numbers, STP re-
entered the plugged-in world with-
out missing a heat. As the band 
pounded through numbers like 
"Trippin' on a Hole in a Paper 
Heart" and "Unglued," Weiland 
continued hi s trademark dance 
about the stage - kind of a cross 
between . a John Travolta-inspired 
"Saturday Night Fever" boogie and 
an Irish jig. 

Not ones to disappoint the 
crowd, STP included in thei r last 
few numbers "Interstate Love 
Song" and "Big Empty," both from 
Purple, and the chart-topping 
"Plush" from Core. Aftcr ex iting 
the stage, triumphant in front of 
thousands of sc reaming fans. STP 
returned for a three-song encore, 
including "Big Bang Baby," and 
topped off the night with the song 
that first gained the band its notori -
ety, "Sex Type Thing." 

The distance that Stone Temple 
Pilots have covered in their sti ll-
young careers is remarkable. With 
one Grammy, two American Music 
Awards, one Billboard Music 
Award. two Billboard Video 
Awards and an MTV Music Video 
Award, STP has proven that they 
will remain on the frontlines of the 
scene, come hell or high water. 

One hopes, though, that the 
band will focus on eliminating the 
obvious drug-related sidetracks and 
continue to keep the great lhing it 
has going. Robert DeLeo seems to 
agree with this goal. 

'The press seems to focus on peo-
ple' personal live ," Delco says: 
"What we really do is make music 
together, and that's a special thing." . 

Making music together has 
come at a premium for Stone Te'm-
pie Pilot . The band is certainly tal-
ented and i primed to put out 
many more album . 

Let' hope that Weiland stays 
clean. And let's hope that RIMAC 
wa n' t the site for STP' last per-
formance.

THE DEFENSE RESTS 
"Trial and Error" is guilty of dullness 

By John Murphy 
Senior Staff Writer 

Michael Richards' star is on the rise. 
Richards. who plays Jerry Seinfeld's eccentric 
neighbor. Kramer. on the hit show "Seinfeld," 
jusl signed a deal with NBC worth a reported 

600.000 an episode. Richards' movie career 
also appears to be stirring, with a major role 
in New Line Cinema's ''Trial and Error," 
which open tomorrow. Unfortunately, this 
talented star cannol save this latest effort from 
what others. namely the film 's writers. have 
wrought. Simply put . thi s film is a exercise in 
Hollywood banality. 

As the film hegins. Ri'chard Rielli 
(Richards). an out-of-work actor, is planning 
hi s friend's bachelor party. His friend, a lawyer 
by the name of Charles TUllle (Jeff Daniels), i 
day~ away from marrying Tiffany. the superfi -
cial daughter of the senior partner of thl.! law 
finn for which TUllle wor~s . Rielti's bachelor-
party plans have 10 be scrapped. however, 
when TUllle's future father-in-law sends him to 
a small town in Arizona to represent a family 
member (Rip Thorn) guilty of fraud. 

Undaunted by the setback, RieUi decides to 
surprise Tuttle by taking the party to AriLOna. 
After a wild night in the \Own's bar celebrating 
hi s last few days as a hachelor, Tuttle wake~ up 
with two black eyes and a nasty hangover. Rlct-
ti. seeing hi ~ friend 's sad state. is forced to don 
Tuttle's suit and take hi s place in court. At the 
courthouse. the predictable madness ensues as 
Rietti tries his hand at lawyering. Meanwhile. a 
slowly recovering Tuttle bcfnends Billie (Char-
li ze Theron). a waitre~s who soon replaces 
Tiffany a~ Tuttle's love i nten:~t.

HI8 HIATUS 

TRAGIC: 
Gwen Stefani 
dumped by bassist 
Continued from .,.,e 11 

At it s inception, No Doubt 
included Gwen's brother Eric Ste-
fani , who was the band's chie f 
songwriter, on accordian and a 
high-school buddy John Spence 
sharing lead voca ls with Gwen. 
Eric switched to keyboards, but 
eventually left the band to pursue a 
career as an animator on "The 
Simpsons." The band lost its other 
founding member in a much more 
tragic fashion , as Spence wmmit-
ted ~uicide in 1987. No Doubt had 
another male vocalist for a time, 
Al an Meade, whom Stefani 
descri bed as "a disco-~mooth 

dark," but he quit to marry hi s 
pregnant 17-year-o ld girlfriend, 
leavi ng Gwen Stefani as No 
Doubt's lone siren. Kanal joined 
the band in mid-1987, quickly 
becoming both the makeshift man-
ager of No Doubt and Gwen's 
boyfriend. Dumont joined the 
group in 1988, and Young became 
the full -ti me drummer in 1989. 

No Doubt fir t signed with 
Interscope Records back in 1992, 
when grunge ruled the scene and 
teen angst wa considered de 
rigeur 10 s ucce~~ . 0 Doubt 's 
eponymous debut album, howev-
er. was infused with peppy ska and 
rock tunes, personified by Gwen 
Stefani's innocent-girl si nging 
style. The album was not right for 
the time. and Inter"ope pulled the 
plug on the promotional tour and 

The UCSD Guardian 

basically let the album die. 
"We thought the label didn ' t do 

its job," Dumont said in a USA 
Today interview. "Looking back, I 
can see they did the right thing. 
Our album didn't sound like any-
thi ng popular at the time. It was 
the wrong climate. Interscope was 
patient and stuck with us." 

No Doubt went back to the 
drawing board and worked on new 
songs for the next three year~ . 
They actuall y composed over 60 
songs, and recorded some of the 
tunes that were not to make it onto 
Tragic Kinlidolll on a self-pro-
duced record entitled Beacoll ST. 
ColleCTion. When Eric Sterani left 
No Doubt and Kanal dumped Ste-
fani after a seven-year relati on-
ship, the band almost di sso lved. 
While at first glance mos t red-

blooded males likely believe 
Kanal is crazy for breaking up 
with the comely Stefani, he was 
apparently just a lot more serious ' 
abou t the relationship than he was .. 

HI forced Tony to go out with 
me," Stefani sa id in an interview 
with Spin. "He wasn't even inter-
ested. When we made out that first 
night, I think he thoughl it was 
more of a one-night ki ss. But then 
we staned going out and after the 
first year, I was goi ng. 'When are 
we gett ing married'?'" 

Stefani penned the lyrics to 
most of the songs that made it on 
to Tragic Kingdom while going 
through the most painful pan of 
the breakup. Running the gamut of 
emotions, from a haughty I'm-
over-you-now tu ne such as

KNAPSACK: 
Trombino offers 
creative insight 
Continued from paee 14 
Which bands have influ-
enced your musical style? 

I don ' t know,l would say differ-
ent stuff like the Replacements. 
Blair, thc lead inger, u ed to listen 
to hard-core in Ihe '80s, so things 
like that really have a lot to do with 
the way we sound. I look to the 
Replacements just because any-
thing I have listened to, si nce they 
broke up or were at their peak , 
. ecms to be in nuenced by them. 
They seem to be the pure Ihing of 
what we do . Ever since them, it's 
been tried and tried and tried and 
beaten into the ground by people 
like us. 
What is the last record that 
you bought? 

The last records 1 bought were 
the new Guided By Voices and the 
new Yo La Tengo at the same time. 
What did you hope to 
accomplish with Day Three 
of My New Life as a follow-
up to your debut album, Sil-
ver Sweepstakes? 

Well , we weren'l rcally all that 
proud of Silver Sweep.frakes when 
it came oul. It was fun to have an 
album out but we cenainly knew 
the mistakes we had made. We 
knew that we would do this and 
thi s and this differently. but that 's 
what people all across the country 
thought we were like. So it was 
great to have a new album and say, 
"No, we ' re better now, li sten to this 
and throw tpat other one away," 
even though' now I'm happy that 
they' re both oul. I don 't wish the 
other one was out of print or any-
thing like that - it's cool. But it 
was Just fun to be able to have a 
new representation of our band . 
You don ' t necessarily redefine 
yourself, but like, your new record 
is what people think of you as, so 
it's nice to always have a new 
opponunity if you feel you have 
progressed as a band and things 
like that. 

We' re still totally proud or this 
record and think it's really good. We 
always joke about the other record 
when it would get bad reviews, we 
wou ld be like, "Yeah, it 's not that 
great, it probably does deserve thaI !" 
But iI 'S great now with this one 
because if it gets a bad review, we' re 
like, "No, you're wrong! It 's good!" 
We finally like this record, so when 
it gets good reviews we don't feel 
like it's undeserved. We don't think 
we're the best band in the world, but 
we think thi s is a good representa-
tion of what we do. 
What are Knapsack's future 
plans? 

We have been really lazy about 
doing a full national tour this time. 
Day Three of My New Ufe has been 
out for a lmost two mont hs and at 
thi s time after Silver SweepJfakes 
was out , we had already done a six-
week national tour. Ri ght now 
we' re just tak ing it slow and doing 
what sounds fun . 

We're also playing some hows 
on the Warped tour and we ' re 
expecting to be hated - but hey, I 
hear you get free hoes. I don 't 
know, we ju t seem so wimpy com-
pared to all those bands. We don ' t 
play that fast. I don't know, we're 
hoping t hat like everyone's gi rl -
friend ' will like us. Whatever girl-
frie nd gets dragged by thw rna ho 
boyfriends to see Pennywise, maybe 
they' II wander ofr to buy a oke. see 
us and l>ay. "Oh, these guy <Ire 
good I"

Cleveland wouldn ' t build a

expect to enjoy the same public

I can' t necessari ly fault the

Seniors Smash Through 97 
TWO: Becker and Markin provided great doubles help for UCSD 
By Travis Hili 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

This spring, Head Coach Brian 
Turner and the UCSD men's tenni 
team will be aying goodbye to two 
extraordinary seniors. Ben Becker and 
Ari Markin have had remarkable ca-
reers as Tritons, filled with 
impressive stories of acri-
fice. determination and heart. 
They were extremely impor-
tant to UCSD's successful 
regular season and its run at 
the Nationals. 

Becker has a particularly 
intere ting story.Hewas pan 
of a championship doubles team in 
high s~hool , and showed tremendous 
promise. He deeided to play here in 
La Jolla, and did well in hi ' freshman 
sea n. 

However, Becker developed a se-
rious back problem. It wasn ' t fully 
diagnosed until his sophomore cam-
paign, but the doctors found a herni -
ated disk and a ruptured disk as well. . 

This is the kind of prohlem tha~ has 
ended the careers of many athletes. 

nl a complicated surgery would 
have allowed Beckerto be completely 

Ben Becker: 
Becker, known for his 
work ethic, was a big part 
of the Triton success of 
the last two seasons. In 
his senior season he 
joined sophomore Steve 
Shabel to form the No .1 
doubles team and went 
10-6 on the season . They 

healed. He chose again t the surgery, 
though. in favorof a rigorous physical 
training regimen that would strengtben 
his back enough to allow him to play. 
This schedu Ie wou Id not allow Becker 
to practice every day, and he would 
on ly be able to see action in doubles 

competition. 
"He would have been one of 

the best ingles players on the 
team" Tumer aid. 

Instead, he became a tremen-
dous doubles player. Becker be-
came a quiet leader who despite 
his absence at practice , lead by 
example. He put in countless 

hours of work; it was not uncommon 
for him to be in physical therapy for 
three or four hours a day. But it was 
worth it. During Becker's junior sea-
on he was part of a 'olid doubles 

squad that was the No. 2 team for 
Turner. Thcn for the 1996-97 season, 
he was paired with Shabcl, a soph -
more, and they immediately becam' 
the No. I Triton duo. 

Their record was 10-6, and in the 
Wcstern Regi nal at Santa ruz 
thc qualified for ationals. Although 
the Triton tandem wa ousted early, it 

Arl Markin: 

was still a successful season and ca-
reer for someone who just two years 
earlier was faced with the pro pect of 
never gelling back on the court. 

Markin also put in many hours of 
work. He wa a relentless competitor 
who was always in great hape. 

"He was always ready to play," 
Turner aid. "He was in great condi-
tion, probably the best on the team. He 
could go out there and play tennis for 
eight hours a day." 

Markin 's role with UCSD was 
imi lar to a sixth man in the NBA. He 

could play singles or doubles. 
Markin s~owed just how good he 

was when the Tritons traveled toPhoc-
nix for a tournament without Becker. 
Turner a 'ked Markin to play in the 
No.1 doubles slot with Shabel against 
one of the best doubles team in Di vi-
sion IU. Markin played amazing ten- _ 
nis, and he and hancl up et them. 
That point gave the Tritons the doubles 
competition, 2- 1, and they ended up 
wi nn ing the match 4-3. 

Tumer will be hard-pres 'ed to re-
place two c mpetitor with the inten-
' ity or Becker and Markin, and they 
will definitely be missed. 

Markin's role on the team 
is comparable to that of a 
sixth man in the NBA. He 
was a tremendous sub. 
filling in admirably in 
singles and doubles 
competition. In the 
Phoen ix tournament, he 
teamed up with Shebel to 

went on to represe~t UCSD at Nationals. defeat one of top teams in Division III.

Earns Honor 
WATER POLO: The 
senior defender 
earned second-team 
All-American honor 
By Jonah Nisenson 
Staff Writer 

I n her four years as a tarter at 
UCSD, Shawna Caballero has 
contributed immen ely to the 
women ' water polo team. Ca-
ballero qualified for Nation~ls 
all four years, and was recently 
named a Second Team .-\11 -

ter Polo Coache Association. 
Caballero, who in her freshman 
year with the Tritons made the 
game-winning shot that gave 
UCSD first place in the CAA 
Final , returned thi s season as a 
two-time captain . 

Playing hole set for the las t 
two 'easons, Caballero proved 
what agreat defensive player he 
i . De pite playing in a posi tion 
not a familiar to her a one that 
would have her driving at the 
goal. Caballero was a major fac -
tor in gell ing the Tritons to thi s 
year's ati onals in Ann Arbor, 
Mich. She led a brilliant defense 
that sent three of the team ' four 
games into overtime. 

Although 0 featured a 
team tilled wi th mexperienced 
player thi ' eason, aballero 
exceeded all of Head oach 
Denny Harper' expe tat ion J a
