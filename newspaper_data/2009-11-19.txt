Chants of “Whose uni-versity? Our univer-sity!” and “We’re fired up — we can’t take it 
no more!” rang through UCLA 
yesterday, where an estimated 500 
students gathered to demonstrate 
against a proposed 32-percent 
student-fee increase. Fourteen 
people, including 12 students, 
were arrested throughout the day.

The three-day UC Board of 
Regents meeting, being held Nov. 

17 to Nov. 19, is tak-
ing place in Covel 
Commons at UCLA. 
Today, the regents 
will vote on a con-
troversial proposal 

to raise student fees at UC cam-
puses by 15 percent, or $585, in 
the spring, and then by an addi-
tional 15 percent, or $1,344, again 
next fall.  

The regents’ Committee on 
Finance voted to pass the pro-
posal yesterday, with the only dis-
senting vote coming from student 
regent Jesse Bernal.

UC President Mark G. Yudof 
claims that rising operation costs 
and dramatically reduced state 
funding have necessitated the fee 
increase which, if approved, will 
be the eighth increase in eight-
years. He said the increased fees 
will allow the university to save 
jobs, classes and campus services

MORE Proposal would charge students $4.47 per quarter;  Loft director claims venue desperate for funding.

Council 
Puts off 
Loft Fee 
Discussion

By Angela Chen
Associate News Editor

The A.S. Council voted 15-4-2 
last night to postpone a decision on 
whether to sponsor a proposed ref-
erendum that would increase student 
fees to fund the Loft, Price Center 
East’s concert venue. Discussion of 
the issue was put off until the third 
week of Winter Quarter.

If passed, the referendum would 
create $4.47 in additional fees for 
undergraduates and $3.82 for gradu-

ates. Additionally, the 
proposal would require 
that at least 80 percent 
of all events at the Loft 
be pay-as-you-can for 
UCSD students and 

that undergraduates represent at least 
60 percent of the venue’s hiring staff. 

Last year, councilmembers debated 
a similar Loft ref-
erendum, which 
would have 
implemented a 
fee of $2.62. The 
council  ulti-
mately rejected 
the proposal 
due to concerns 
with student 
oversight.  The 
suggested fee has 
such risen, partly 
due to a differ-
ence in enroll-
ment numbers, 
but also because 
Loft representa-
tives requested a 
larger lump sum.

“Last year, we 
hoped that we 
would be receiv-
ing more money 
from registration fees,” Loft director 
Martin Wollesen said. “Unfortunately, 
with budget cuts, this was unable to 
happen.” 

According to Wollesen, without 
the proposed fee, the Loft will be 
unable to maintain programming, 
resulting in admission changes and 
student lay-offs. 

Student oversight, a main factor 
in the debate over last year’s Loft pro-
posal, was also a decisive factor in the 
council’s discussion last night.

The oversight language outlined 
in the referendum was approved by 
the majority of the A.S. special com-
mittee formed to discuss the referen-
dum. Wollesen also said he found the 
level of student oversight provided 
for in the original referendum to 
be acceptable, but Gupta said that

UC student fees have

lion in new revenue

state funding.

OFF CAMPUS — Call me an alo-

in life better spent on the tipsy side. 
Maybe you’re depressed about the 
future. Perhaps you’re distraught over 
the unpragmatic nature of Marxist 
theory. Or maybe you just want to 
celebrate Cinco de Mayo.

No matter the circumstance, 
Hillcrest’s Tractor Room will help get

Start with English Breakfast — a

work your way to one of Tractor’s 
eclectic $10 Bloody Marys. Prices are 
slightly steep, but think of it this way: 
You can’t skimp on the most impor-
tant meal of the day.

Researchers Visualize Bacterial Chatter
By Regina Ip
Staff Writer

A breakthrough in visualizing 
how bacterial communication may 
lead to the discovery of drugs that 
could be capable of tackling diseases 
and infections caused by bacteria and 
microbes, like cancer, diabetes, ulcers 
and allergies.

UCSD researchers used a revo-
lutionary imaging technique called 
Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption 
Ionization-Time of Flight mass spec-
trometry to see how bacteria commu-
nicate, allowing them to observe the 
chemical signals that are exchanged. 
Before this type of imaging mass spec-
trometry, which was normally used to 
determine the properties of chemical 
structures, there were no tools that 
could study cell-to-cell communica-
tion of microorganisms involving 
multiple signals.

 “Now what we have the capac-
ity to do is to see the communica-
tion in a multiplexed fashion,” Pieter 
Dorrestein, assistant professor at 
UCSD’s Skaggs School of Pharmacy 
and Pharmaceutical Sciences, said. 
“That’s a really distinct and significant 
advantage over what has been done in 
the past.”

Deciphering how microorganisms 
communicate is essential to under-
standing how their signals can change 
or influence the behavior of neighbor-

ing organisms. 
Now that researchers have an 

imaging technique to observe these 
signals, they can isolate signaling 
molecules – which have the ability to 
inhibit the growth of other organisms 
– to create antibiotic, antiviral, anti-
fungal or even anticancer drugs.

 “A big part in the development of 
new drugs begins with an observation 
that an organism makes an activity 
that inhibits the growth of another 
organism,” Paul Straight, assistant pro-
fessor of biochemistry and biophysics 
at Texas A&M University, said.  “We 
can now see, in the genome of many 
different bacteria and fungi and other 
organisms, that they can potentially 
make compounds that have never 
been seen before.  What we can do 
now is scan these and screen them 
in a way that opens up our access to 
higher diversity of potential therapeu-
tics from any given organism.” 

The research collaboration drew 
on Dorrestein’s knowledge of new 
technologies in mass spectrometry, 
Straight’s concentration in microbial 
interactions and UCSD post-doctoral 
students Yu-Liang Yang’s and Yuquan 
Xu’s expertise in the modification of 
bacterial growth. 

Dorrestein’s lab is now studying 
how different molecules interact  and 
if those molecules have potential 
therapeutic value.  This research may 
allow scientists to translate bacterial 

language into a database that docu-
ments signaling molecules and their 
functions. 

Microbes use molecules like 
penicillin to communicate with their 
environment.  Bacteria, however, 
secrete a large number of these mol-
ecules instead of just one molecule.  
Each of the molecules communicates 
something different.  Due to the study, 
researchers can now understand what 
the molecules are communicating, 
which they have been unable to do in 
the past.    

 “We’re excited,” Yang said. “There 
is a new problem that we can figure 
out and can ask more questions 
about.” 

The team is beginning to work 
with biotech companies and agricul-
tural businesses to see if their research 
can be used to change and improve 
existing medical products.

“It’s also very rewarding to do this 
kind of collaborative  research where 
two different groups that have two 
separate types of scientific focus can 
share their expertise and get science 
done that way,” Straight said.

Texas A&M University, the 
National Institutes of Health and the 
Beckman Foundation, a charitable 
organization that supports scientific 
research, funded the project.

SUNNY-SIDE UP By Philip Rhie

wrong.
The bishops absurdly condemned 

the pre-amendment plan as an 
“accounting gimmick,” seeing as the 
bill as proposed would fund abortion-
covering insurers, but wouldn’t 
actually use tax dollars to pay for 
abortions. The group threatened to 
withdraw support for the legislation 
unless the bill included a stipulation 
that prohibited federal money from 
going to any insurance provider 
that covered abortion — “forcing” 
Democrats who needed an official 
OK from those pointy-hatted zealots 
to withdraw their support for the bill.

So much for separation of church 
and state.

The USCCB wields this ridiculous 
upper hand thanks to voting clout of 
68 million Catholics in the U.S., as 
well as the fervent political activism 
of its members — who are regularly 
in contact with lawmakers — upon 
whom they don’t hesitate to rain 
input. Recently, the group distributed 
fliers to every parish in the nation 
asking churchgoers to pray for abor-
tion restrictions and contact repre-
sentatives, encouraging them to push 
for bills in their favor. 

The amendment’s very real inclu-
sion transcends the often theoreti-
cal church-state separation debate. 
Should it become law, the measure 
would likely force insurers (87 
percent of which currently cover 
abortions) to drop abortions from 
their plans in order to meet the new 
health-care market.

The final bill reveals the discon-
certing influence our country’s reli-
gious leaders have over their govern-
ment. Bishops now have even more 
proof that they can be a dominating 
force in politics — a disturbing pros--
pect that threatens the separation of 
church and state.

So — despite considerable bipartii
san support — the USCCB’s heavy 
behind-the-scenes lobbying and 
grassroots organization left the bill 
tainted by religious doctrine. And 
suddenly, thanks to some influentiall 

R aise your hand if you’re as burnt out on being angry about the impending student-
fee increases as we are. The picket 
signs, teach-ins, heartbreaking anec-
dotal forums, commissions on the 
future — all gallant efforts toward 
change — seem to be riling a stag-
nant sort of heat. Nobody can take 
another financial hit in this economy, 
and the UC Board of Regents has no 
goddamn idea what to do about it.

We’re trying our hardest to avoid 
a defeatist attitude, and, ultimately, 
we would like to commend the 
protestors. The Sept. 24 walkout, 
though conducted with a not-so-
community-building ruthlessness 
and somewhat meager turnout
compared to Berkeley, was UCSD’s 
biggest rebel-rouser since the Prop. 8 
fiasco: a refreshing shot of outcry we 
could all care about. 

But it doesn’t come 
as much surprise that 
the walkouts ended 
there. Principally, 
we’re all students, not 
professional protes-
tors — even those 
designated to protest 

by student councils and orgs have an 
outside life to deal with. So, thank 
you for trying It’s easy for ignorant, you for trying. Its easy for ignorant,

thats the thats the fault of those w
out there, not those who made what-
ever push they could.

That said, the intention of student 
government systemwide to camp 
out at the Nov. 17 regents meet-
ing — where they will vote on a 
32-percent student-fee increase — is 
a waste of momentum. We need to 
choose a battle with at least some 
sliver of hope for victory. Despite 
any illusions of a “public comment 
period” the regents decided on this 
fee increase a long time ago. There is 
not a chance in hell they’ll compro-
mise the prestige of our university 
or make more faculty cuts to keep 
student fees low — especially know-
ing there will always be applicants 
too apathetic or uncaring to resist a 
heftier tuition bill (or resist handing 
it off to their parents).

Sure, the protests have been 
enough to scare UC President Mark 
G. Yudof into the depths of his office, 
spitting out lionhearted letters to 
avoid facing the pissed-off students 
and staff stomping around his cam-
puses. We also seem to have scared 
him into propping up a mighty fine 
financial-aid plan (though who 
knows, maybe that grand gesture 
flowed from the sheer kindness of 
his Blue and Gold heart). The fact 
that the UCSD financial aid depart-
ment has already sent 2009-10 
grant recipients its updated Winter 
Quarter allocations to accommo-
date the fee increase — a paranoid 
effort to qualm pre-decision fears or 
outrage — is a clear indication that 
the regents already have their minds 
made up.

It is indeed necessary to show 
the regents that there will always be 
a pack of watchdogs on their every 
move. But student leaders hold an 
even greater responsibility: to find 
ways of making a real change. It’s a 
much more daunting and unstable 
task — and requires breaking away 
from the standard march down 
Library Walk — but we’ve got to 
target the only real source of fund-
ing left in this devastating statewide ing g

a variety of causes less impactful f l i tf l
(albeit noble) to the future of our 
state and nation.

What we really need, of course, 
is a constitutional convention to 
change our state’s voter-locked fund-
ing methods which make it virtually 
impossible for legislators to shave 
spare change off less-hurting tax 
recipients. Chances are, even our 
hard-jawed governor would find it in 
his heart to fund higher education if 
he had some more leg room to ration 
the bank account — and many other 
legislators have expressed a strong 

desire to 
support the 
University of 
California. 
With a 
slightly 
social-
ist move 
toward more 
government-
controlled 
tax revenue, 
it would 
just take a 
few simpler 
“marches on 
Sacramento” 

— as Yudof so heroically put it — to 
cure the rise in student fees. May’s 
statewide ballot measures, under 
the protection of 1B, attempted to 
preserve as much emergency funding 
for education as possible. In the end, 
it was California voters who trashed 
it. We need to make these voters see 
how important an affordable educa-
tion is to their personal and public 
future.

A.S. President Utsav Gupta has 
discussed a possible effort to lobby 
the San Diego community for its 
support of the UC cause. However, 
there are no signs of interest so far 
from his External Affairs counter-
parts in jumping on the initiative. If 
any of the A.S. budget or manpower 
was allotted to letting Californians 
know the dire situation we’re in, we 
might finally be making some head-

ff d bl f t here iti ff dable future where it

and see Yudof s name in the newsand see Yudof s name in the news-
paper, but unless they have a child 
currently enrolled in the university 
or are themselves alumni, the public-
education plight is not necessarily 
at the top of their list of budgetary 
concerns. 

Here’s an idea: we band together 
to run a public information cam-
paign targeting voters. We ask them 
“Where would you be without your 
college education?” or “Where will 
your child/community be without 
the same?” and spread it statewide 
on mailbox flyers and public service 
announcements, asking Californians 
to bug their representatives in 
Sacramento, or just keep the cause 
in mind on a future ballot. Through 
these efforts we might come that 
much closer to convincing those who 
have the power to make a difference 
that access to public higher educa-
tion is worthy of their support.

Unfortunately, at this point, 
by targeting Yudof and the dead-
spirited regents, we’re attempting 
to beat down a bolted gate with an 
insufficient army. Maybe they’re just 
not being creative enough in the 
search for alternative funding — or 
are too wussy to try and push around 
the millions in graduate research — 
but the fact is, the leaders of the UC 
system have not found a solution to 
maintain the quality of the university 
without additional support from stu-
dent fees. So let’s stop complaining 
and find it ourselves.

A.S. Advances 
Plans for Year-
Round Sun God, 
Greek Store

By Ayelet Bitton
Staff Writer

In an attempt to cater to a per-
ceived student demand for A.S. 
merchandise and Greek apparel, 
A.S. councilmembers are slowly but 
surely hammering out a business 
proposal for a permanent A.S. store, 
to be completed and submitted to the 
University Center Advisory Board by 
the end of Fall Quarter 2009.

For the past several years, the 
A.S. Council has set aside a few 
weeks during Spring Quarter to 
open a temporary venue for its Sun 
God paraphernalia. Over the past 
six months, however, the council 
has looked to make the store a per-
manent fixture that would operate 
throughout the entire school year 
and offer an expanded range of mer-
chandise, including more council 
and Greek-related stock.

Councilmembers set up a com-
mittee at the start of Fall Quarter to 
address the feasibility of the store and 
how to make it a reality. According to 
committee chair and campuswide 
senator Tobias Haglund, the com-
mittee’s work is nearing completion.

“We’re hoping to have the pro-
posal ready for UCAB by the end of 
the quarter,” Haglund said.

Once a proposal is submitted and 
accepted by UCAB, councilmembers 
can focus on other aspects of the 
store such as its location and con-
struction. After a plan is approved, 
it typically takes anywhere from six 
months to a year for a store to open, 
University Centers Director Paul 
Terzino said.

“For this kind of business, it 
might take three to nine months,”

Tensions were high last night between councilmembers and advocates for the Loft as the 
twice-failed-in-the-past-two-years, 
now newly revised, Loft fee referen-
dum was brought yet again to the A.S. 
table at yesterday’s council meeting. 

About 30 Loft street team mem-
bers brought 1,500 student signatures 
and personal testimonies in hopes of 
swaying coun-
cilmembers to 
support the $4.47 
per student per 
quarter fees for 
increased fund-
ing for the Loft.

An hour-long 
public input 
period followed, as various Loft lovers 
rose to speak on the venue’s behalf.  

“We want to promote diversity and 
we’ve done that through our events 
from wine tasting to drag shows,” Loft 
lover and Marshall senior Rob Corea 
said. “We offer something unique to 
this college community.” 

However, Muir Commuter Council 
co-chair Claire Luciano presented ten 
reasons why the council should not 
support the Loft’s fee referendum. 

“The Loft is a valuable space, but it 
needs to be a business and not come 
crying to A.S. every six months for a 
referendum,” Luciano said. “It’s insult-
ing and disgusting that we know when 
we have other fee increases to think 
about, that there’s this Loft referen-
dum.”  

During member reports, Vice 
President of Finance and Resources 
Peter Benesch informed the council 
that funds from the A.S. Soft Reserves 
were down 45 percent from last quar-
ter, but a plan is set for a campaign 
next quarter to boost sales. 

After various, seemingly insig-
nificant member reports, the council 
returned to the issue of the Loft.  

The A.S. Special Committee to 

Review the Proposed University 
Centers Programming Fee voted 
earlier to bring the referendum to the 
council in hopes of a passing vote to 
put the fee a Winter Quarter 2010 spe-
cial election ballot. 

The committee’s hopes and the 
Loft lovers’ testimonies only did so 
much. Councilmembers voted 15-4-2 
to postpone the vote for the Loft refer-

endum until third 
week of Winter 
Quarter 2010. 

Because the 
council voted 
to postpone the 
issue until Winter 
Quarter, the Loft 
referendum fee 

could only make it onto the Spring 
Quarter ballot if approved. No addi-
tional funding would go toward the 
Loft until Fall Quarter 2010 at the 
earliest. 

VP Student Life Riscie Hernandez, 
who served on the Special Committee, 
was visibly unhappy with her fellow 
councilmembers’ decision.  

During question time, Benesch, 
on behalf of an absent Associate Vice 
President of Enterprise Operations 
Rishi Ghosh, explained the plans for 
the Grove Cafe. Plans for mini-pizzas, 
the use of dining dollars and a more 
sustainable cafe are in the works. The 
revamped Grove is set to open first 
week of Winter Quarter.  

Councilmembers sang “Happy 
Birthday” to AVP Diversity Affairs 
Jasmine Phillips and congratulated 
Executive Assistant Heather Lucas on 
her recent engagement. 

Despite the minute of cheer, hard 
feelings still remained. 

“I have lost every bit of respect 
for you,” Hernandez said, addressing 
the council. “You all can take some 
responsibility for deteriorating student 
life on this campus for the next two 
months.”

that would otherwise be cut by cre-
ating millions of dollars in new net 
revenue.  

Almost an hour after a public 
comment period was supposed to 
have ended, the meeting was inter-
rupted repeatedly by loud outbursts 
from the 50 audience members 
who had come to offer their input, 
prompting police to arrest eight 
people from the crowd at approxi-
mately 10 a.m.

Students spoke out against the 
fee hikes throughout the day.

“I’m an independent student; 
I don’t have parents to help sup-
port me,” UCLA sophomore Chloe 
Underdue said. “I work every day 
in the dining halls. I’m from the 
projects in San Francisco, and I can’t 
afford these fee increases. I don’t 
think money should stop me from 
getting a good education. This is 
something I need to be a part of. 
I can’t go to class today knowing 
I might not be able to return next 
quarter because I can’t afford it.”

Joining the protest were dozens 
of staff and facultymembers, as well 
as members of AFSCME Local 3299, 
a union representing over 20,000 
UC service and patient-care work-
ers. 

Though the demonstration 
began without incident, the mood 
quickly turned sour once police offi-
cers — clad in riot gear and armed 
with batons and guns — formed a 
line around the Covel Commons, 
demanding that protestors move 
back. Officers soon erected barri-
cades in front of the entrance to the 
building.

Several students were hurt after 
a group of protestors rushed the 
barricades in front of the premises 
at about 11:15 a.m., a UCPD officer 
said. The ensuing scuffles between 
police and protestors culminated in 
an additional five arrests.

According to several protesters at 
the scene, a bottle of liquid, possibly 
vinegar, was thrown at police, and 
officers began tasing students, strik-
ing them with batons and pointing 
their guns in an effort to quell the 
demonstration. After the crowd was 
dispersed, a group of angry protes-
tors, some crying, confronted the 
officers. 

“How can you do this?” one 
woman screamed. “Don’t you have 
kids? You’re making me lose faith 
in people.”

UCLA sophomore Yolanda 
Stephanie De Loera said that she is 
the first person in her family to go 
to college, but fears that high tuition 
may force her out of school. 

“We went in there to protest for 
our rights, because we’re students 
and we have that voice, but they cut 
them off [in the middle of] their 
speech,” De Loera said. “And then 
we got tased and pepper-sprayed for 
doing a protest for our education. 
We were forced out of the delibera-
tion room. That cannot be done. I 
got a gun taken out on me. People 
are being physically, mentally and 
emotionally hurt right now.”

Demonstrators then moved to 
the east side of the building, where 
student regent Jesse Bernal and stu-
dent regent-designate Jesse Cheng

Swiping that first Tootsie Pop from the local corner store before puberty taught How-to 
Guru an important lesson: Free food 
tastes better. 

And UCSD certainly doesn’t have 
a shortage. The temptation of a free 
slice of pepperoni seldom fails to 
rally the troops to the most forlorn 
corners of Sixth College — even 
when it first requires enduring a half-
hour presentation on marching for 
Jesus. But the endless string of cam-
pus freebies does occasionally dry up. 
When they do, supermarket samples 
are available to exploit year-round.

From Costco to Trader Joe’s 
to Whole Foods to our very own 
Sunshine Market, a whole world of 
free samples is yours for the grazing 
— if you know where to stick your 
nose. 

The first step to scoring a free-
sample dinner: Scout the area. 
Awareness of your surroundings is 
instrumental in your exploitation 
of any squeaky-clean, tile-floored 
environs. Note all employees watch-
ing and judge their level of interest 
in their minimum-wage work. Some 
celebrate their Ralphs-embroidered 
polo-shirt uniform, and will jump on 
any opportunity to scold you. Others 
wouldn’t bat an eye if you shoved 
a watermelon up your shirt and 
booked it to Starbucks. 

Keeping up appearances for the 
former will help you pass as a genu-
ine customer, so make sure to push 
a shopping cart sprinkled with a 
few choice items for distraction. A 
single free-range chicken or chunk 
of imported French cheese should 
serve well to prevent any suspiscion 
of foul play.

Second: Seek out the finger food. 
Any snack sold in bulk with a con-
venient self-serve shovel (nuts, dried 
fruit, granola, jelly beans) is right-
fully yours for the tasting. Do not, 
however, extend your grimy paw into 
a food bin; not only is such behavior 
unsanitary, it will call immediate, 
red-handed attention to your trans-
gression. 

Use the tongs at the olive bar to 
pluck a single morsel, then grab it 
with your fingers and stuff it in your 
salivating maw. The object of the 
game, after all, is to look as incon-
spicuous as possible to achieve maxi-
mum sample-meal volume.

Third: Never make eye contact. 
Aim to be invisible — this way 
you’ll attract minimum attention. It’s 
also critical to always keep moving. 
Lurking in the same snack aisle for a 
minute too long makes you a prime 
target for neurotic employees and 
undercover theft preventers.

It should be noted that tasting 
fruit is easiest. If there aren’t any 
employees around (or even if there 
are), grabbing a handful of grapes 
here or an apple there to brazenly 
munch on while shopping has never 
been denounced in How-to Guru’s 
experience. Besides, what other pur-
pose could there possibly be for the 
produce-section trash bins than as a 
place to toss your apple core?

But if you’re going for quantity

Like everything else in this failed state economy, the Loft — that haven of commercialized alternativeness on the second floor of Price Center East — is broke. And, like others in need (cough, 
Parking and Transportation Services), the fledgling concert venue wants 
us to drag it out of the red by approving another student fee — this one 
through an Associated Students referendum that, if passed by a majority 
of the student body with at least 20 percent turnout, would charge under-
grads $4.47 and grad students $3.82 per quarter to fund the nightclub-
turned-cafe.  

Though the Loft originally aimed to present its referendum to stu-
dents next quarter, Wednesday night’s A.S. Council meeting shelved 
discussion on the matter until Week 3 of Winter Quarter. We believe the 
council was justified in putting off the decision until the referendum is 
rewritten. 

It’s true that the Loft serves a unique purpose. Nowhere else on cam-
pus will you find a Latin American chocolate-tasting one 
night and an experimental string quartet playing the next. 
In its first year of business, the venue’s not only succeeded 
in drawing hour-long lines for popular acts like the band 
Why? with pay-as-you-can programming, it’s also given 
everyone something better to do on a Thursday night than 
get a head start on that Dostoevsky essay.

Yet there, in one of its greatest strengths, also lies the 
Loft’s inherent limitation: despite the diversity of the ven-

ue’s programming, it still appeals most to a thin slice of the student body. 
The average UCSD student isn’t interested in parting with his chemistry 
book or makeshift beer pong table on any night of the week — neither for 
the promise of a wine tasting nor of a memorable set from Metronomy. 
Even if he wanted to attend a show at the Loft, the space’s tiny 235-person 
maximum capacity may well prohibit his entry anyway. For as many free 
shows as the Loft gives us, there’s never any guarantee that a night begun 
at the back of the line will end in a dreamy post-show haze.

In Winter Quarter 2009, the Loft proposed a much smaller quarterly 
fee of $2.62 (which failed to rally enough A.S. Council support to get it on 
the ballot). But thanks to shrinking enrollment and insufficient registra-
tion-fee funding, Martin Wollesen, director of the university events office, 
decided to up that figure to $4.47. But increased need or not, the entire 
student body shouldn’t have to pay so much for a free perk that the select 
few Buddy Holly-lookalikes among us take advantage of. The Loft, after 
all, is a business — one that, with a regular contingent of non-student 
concertgoers, isn’t intended solely for our own weeknight amusement.

But as for the referendum itself, one of its most glaring issues, as it 
went before the council Wednesday night, was its lack of provisions for 
student oversight. The proposal, as drafted by the A.S. Special Committee 
to Review the Proposed University Centers Programming Fee, only 
required the University Centers Advisory Board and A.S. Council to give 
a yearly OK to how our fees are spent. All else would be out of student 
control.

A.S. President Utsav Gupta believes that kind of oversight is insuf-

MASTER OF ARTS
INTERNATIONAL STUDIES

In today’s global environment, expertise in international affairs
is essential to understanding the contemporary world.
The Chapman University Master of Arts in International Studies is a two-year,
full-time, interdisciplinary course of study designed to train students seeking
a career in U.S. Foreign Service, the United Nations (U.N.), U.N.–specialized
agencies, or international non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Our program
is well-rounded with academic and practical training, professional and regional
tracks, international internships and hands-on experience for today’s world.

For more information, contact Dr. James Coyle, program director, at 714-744-7074
or coyle@chapman.edu.

You know things are heating up when the cops bust out their riot gear. 
Kevlar vests, rubber bullets, stun 

guns and tear gas canisters rarely 
accompany sunshine and happiness. 
Zip ties, broken bottles and screams 
of anger typically signal a ‘shit has hit 
the fan’ type scenario, wherein some 
group of individuals is exceptionally 
pissed off and another is exceptionally 
nervous. 

That was the scene yesterday when 
hundreds of students gathered outside 
UCLA’s Covel Commons, picket signs 
in hand as they bellowed their oppo-
sition to a controversial 32-percent 
fee-hike proposal. Tensions were high 
and tears were shed. Protestors threw 
bottles and police officers replied with 
Tasers. At one point, a group of stu-
dents rushed the door. Over a dozen 
people were arrested.

Somewhere inside the red brick 
building sat the regents, their minds 
already made up. The fee increases 
will pass. That decision was finalized a 
long time ago, away from angry mobs 
or tear-streaked cries of betrayal. This 
meeting is a symbolic affair. Like an 
awards show but without the applause.

The thing about the UC Board of 
Regents is that no matter how vio-
lent a protest gets or how dramatic a 
scene it are confronted with, it remain 
completely unaffected. At the end of 
the day, a few hundred people storm-
ing around with cardboard signs is a 
relatively small inconvenience. Local 
newspapers will run a couple of sto-
ries. There might even be an iconic 
photograph or two (see: page three). 
But soon the hype will pass, and 
everything will go back to normal.

Until next year, that is, when the 
board decides to raise fees yet again. 

And that right there is the heart of 
the problem. This whole unfortunate 

charade is an unending cycle. A simi-
lar protest took place last year, and 
the year before. Another one will take 
place next year and probably the year 
after that. A protest alone is simply 
ineffective. It is a flash in the pan, a 
brief moment of disarray that quickly 
fades from memory if left without the 
support of a larger political movement 
to carry on the momentum.

Anyone can yell angrily at a wall 
of police officers. It takes real orga-
nization and real political action to 
produce something worthwhile out 
of all that anger. The scene at UCLA 
will keep repeating itself over and 
over again unless some fundamental 
change is made in the way we address 
the problem of rising fees. The first 

thing we need to realize is that the 
regents are not the enemy — they’re 
just the most convenient targets. The 
real problem is the state Legislature, 
a governing body that has repeatedly 
demonstrated its disinterest in the 
wellbeing of our university systems. 

Last week, the Guardian editorial 
board suggested that student lead-
ers pool their resources to launch a 
statewide public awareness campaign 
aimed at California voters. The mes-
sage: public universities are in trouble. 
We would broadcast the message in 
television ads, print it on pamphlets, 
scatter it across the Internet and rein-
force it through frequent discussion. 
The campaign would shift our focus 
from the regents to the Legislature, 

making this fight something more 
than a useless internal skirmish. 
Rather than going through the 
same tired motions year after year, 
we would be working to enact last-
ing political change by convincing 
California’s electorate to make public 
universities a priority.

Politicians listen, especially when 
their reelection prospects are in 
jeopardy. But that will only happen 
if higher education becomes a politi-
cal issue, something voters can get 
angry about, put on bumper stickers, 
talk about at work and hear about on 
television. 

Isolated protests won’t raise the 
awareness necessary to affect change. 
It’s time to try something new.

ficient — and we agree. It’s not 
uncommon for university officials 
to misappropriate student activity 
fees for purposes other than what 
we the students want (see: tread-
mill-less RIMAC Annex). 

To eliminate those surprise mis-
uses, Gupta proposed a revised ref-
erendum Wednesday night which 
would grant students far more 
oversight. His plan would create a 
student-majority Loft governance 
board to keep an eye on how our 
fees are spent. It would also require 
the council to approve the Loft’s 
operating budget with a two-thirds 
majority vote each year — both of 
which, we believe, would adequate-
ly address the oversight issue. 

Gupta’s plan doesn’t stop there. 
It also demands that half of the 
Loft’s events (rather than the cur-
rent 20 percent) be set aside for 
student org events, with special 
weekly priority for A.S. Concerts 
and Events shows on Friday and 
Saturday nights.

But as much as we love empow-
erment, a fee-supported Loft that’s 
forced to bend over backward for 
student orgs would ultimately suf-
fer. A new programming philosophy 
that prioritizes college-sponsored 
root-beer pong over Jens Lekman 
concerts would ruin the reason we 
like the Loft so much now — the 
programming is actually good. 

There’s a reason professionals 
curate the Loft: because they know, 
better than any mighty A.S. appoin-
tee, how to organize a compelling 
lineup of events. At the end of the 
day, it’s not our job as students to 
replace those professionals — we 
just have to ensure they don’t pull a 
disappearing act with our fees.

ON THE LINE By Christina Aushana

Dear Editor,
In an extended interview with 

student journalists, UC President 
Mark G. Yudof showed himself to 
be an expert of the fine legal art 
of parsing words. For instance, he 
seems to claim that student fees are 
going up in order to protect instruc-
tional quality and access. 

“Remember that when we 
increase fees, one-third of that goes 
to scholarships so there’s more 
money in the bank for scholarships,” 
Yudof said. “Actually, we spend only 
two out of three of the dollars that 
we spend out of student fees. Two-
thirds of it goes to the instruction 
program and the like, and the other 
one-third goes to increasing finan-
cial aid.” 

One way that Yudof tried to scare 
students into accepting increased 
fees is to tell them that if they do not 
accept the increases, the quality of 
undergraduate education will suffer.

“And the enemy in all of this is 
mediocrity,” Yudof said. “We can 
make your classes bigger, it can take 
you longer to get your degrees [and] 
class access is worse. We can do a 
lot of things to achieve mediocrity 
— in fact, mediocrity is fairly easy 
to achieve. But we’re not going to do 
that.” 

The problem with this statement 
is that class sizes have already gone 
up, and the number of classes has 
already gone down. In other words, 
the system is both raising fees and 
lowering the quality of education at 
the same time. 

One of Yudof ’s most question-
able moments came when he acted 
surprised to hear that class sizes are 
expanding and that programs are 
being reduced.

“We are getting more and more 

reports of large classes and closed 
sections,” he said.

 It seems that Yudof has forgotten 
that throughout the summer, he was 
telling everyone that there would be 
expanded class sizes and fewer class 
offerings due to the state funding 
reduction. 

Instead of limiting enrollment 
and raising fees, unions and student 
groups argue that the University 
of California should just use the 
money it has to get itself through 
the current reduction in state funds. 
After all, the total UC budget is $20 
billion, and the state reduction was 
$600 million, which is less than 3 
percent of the budget. 

While Yudof usually says that 
the University of California cannot 
borrow its way out of the situation, 
he does admit here that they could 
finance their way out of the current 
problem as a last resort. We should 
not forget that right after the state 
reduced the UC budget, the univer-
sity turned around and then lent 
$200 million to the state. 

The first step is stopping Yudof 
and others in claiming that saying 
‘no’ to new fees will result in UC 
poverty. We must demand that the 
university starts representing its 
financial status in a clear and consis-
tent manner.

over quality, nothing compares to 
Costco for scoring a full three-course 
meal of samples. 

The beefed-up grocery store litters 
its aisles with little old ladies doling 
out macaroni and cheese or pumpkin 
pie bits. They think it will help them 
sell more products — but who are 
they kidding? How-to Guru just goes 
to score a free meal. With such sam-
ple variety, you probably won’t pass 
the same booth twice. Even if you do, 
that old bag handing out samples has 
most likely been a Costco employee 
since 1932 and probably won’t 
remember you.

Though arguably more delicious 
than Costco, Trader Joe’s is a little 

trickier to sample from. First of all, 
there’s only one lone sample station in 
the whole store, typically manned by 
a dutiful employee there to prepare 
the goods. Repeat trips require skill. 
Hide yourself behind another sampler 
on the first grab, allowing your hot 
little hands to dart into sample zone 
and snag a serving without ever being 
associated with your face — that way 
the booth lackey won’t recognize you 
on the second visit. 

For that tricky third helping, 
flattery is key. Fawn over the spring 
rolls that are ‘microwaved to perfec-
tion.’ Heartfelt exclamations such as 
‘Oh, my God, this reminds me of the 
meatballs my mother used to make 
me — before she passed,’ will unfail-

ingly endear you to the embittered 
sample-doler. When you request ‘just 
one more little bite,’ she’ll gladly heap 
it into your extended palm, blissfully 
ignorant of the fact that you’re really 
just in it for the free nosh. 

Remember, sample hunting is 
a low-risk activity. The sampling 
strategies enumerated here do not 
endanger you, the not-quite culprit, 
to any kind of real punishment, apart 
from the occasional dirty look or 
nasty scolding in passing. Embrace 
your inner mooch and enjoy the free 
sample game while it lasts — you 
can’t play after you graduate.

NEWS� THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 2009� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 9 

Peter Benesch said.
“In an ideal world, I would like to 

have this up and ready to go before 
Sun God this year,” Benesch said. 
“Having it open for more or less 
a quarter would be great in terms 
of getting ourselves visible to the 
UCSD community for the next fall. 
In a more realistic world though, 
it may be opening the beginning 
of fall — it’s really hard to predict.”
� � While the council’s first step in 
constructing the store is completing 
a proposal for UCAB, there are many 
other obstacles after that.

“It’s not solely dependent on our 
efforts,” Benesch said. “It’s actually 
dependent on a lot of administra-
tors and committees deciding they’re 
willing to undergo this venture. We 
have UCAB, approval of vice chan-
cellors after that, the A.S. Council 
has to approve of it — several admin-
istrative steps need to be taken.”

A major issue in the creation of 
the store is determining where on 
campus it would be located.

“We’re looking at any open spaces 
in Price Center — maybe in the old 
post office area or across from the 
Loft,” Haglund said. “We’re just look-
ing to get an idea in our heads of 
what it would look like.”

According to Terzino, should the 
A.S. store take up shop in Price 
Center, the council will likely pay 

a much lower rent than other non-
student businesses on campus.

“We are hoping to get a break 
on rent,” Haglund said. “If not, we 
understand the position UCAB 
is in. We do hope that is some-
thing that would be available to us 
though, since we do offer a service 
to students along with just mer-
chandise.”

While most vendors generally 
pay between $3 and $5 per square 
foot each month in rent, University 
Centers may be willing to offer the 
store a lower rate.

“It depends on what’s being sold 
and how much revenue they expect,” 
Terzino said. “It’s kind of a broad 
range.”

Once created, the A.S. store would 
draw half of its profits from Greek 
apparel, a quarter from Sun God mer-
chandise and the final quarter from 
seasonal items such as graduation or 
holiday-related items, Benesch said. 
The council wants to ensure that no 
items would overlap with the book-
store’s merchandise.

“Students want to enjoy the uni-
versity,” Benesch said. “They are very 
proud of events like Sun God. They 
enjoy them, and we want to give 
them things that can commemorate 
these things they are proud of.”

were told they would be better heard 
by the regents. Several speakers 
urged the crowd to continue pro-
testing, despite the Committee on 
Finance’s  vote to approve the fee 
increase. 

“They don’t give a shit,” UC 
Students Association President 
Victor Sanchez said. “They didn’t 
even look at us during public com-
ment. What does that say? We need 
to reclaim our education … We’re 
going to head back up there now. 
We’re going to be back here tomor-
row, tonight and make sure the stu-
dent voice is heard.”

UCLA Labor Director Kent 
Wong spoke out against the use of 
weapons by UCPD police.

“University police shouldn’t be 
pointing guns in students’ faces,” 
Wong said, eliciting loud cheers 
from the crowd. “This is a peaceful, 
non-violent protest. [There has been 
an] unacceptable use of batons and 
Tasers. It is a disgrace when power 
structures in California are trying to 

balance the budgets on the backs of 
students and workers. A disgrace!”

Second-year graduate student and 
teaching assistant Mzilikazi Koné said 
students should be angry about being 
made to bear the brunt of the cuts. 

“Students are paying more for 
less quality,” Koné said. “I don’t think 
[the regents] are going to change 
their minds, or that they’re even 
listening to us … [but] this protest 
is about us — students, faculty and 
staff — coming together and build-
ing a movement around this issue.”

Protestors from across the state 
will be gathering at an overnight 
on-campus “tent city” to continue 
protesting Thursday.

Organizers of the event, called 
Crisis Fest, plan to have discussions 
of the international student move-
ment, dodgeball & frisbee matches, 
workshops, live music and a General 
Assembly to discuss the future of the 
movement.

the amount of power students would 
receive over Loft operations was not 
extensive enough. 

In its current form, the refer-
endum would give the University 
Centers Advisory Board the ability to 
review and approve the allocation of 
funds for the Loft each year by major-
ity vote. UCAB would also be able to 
reduce or eliminate the fee entirely if 
two-thirds of all voting UCAB stu-
dent members at two consecutive 
meetings vote as such. 

Gupta said the delegation of over-
sight was a problem.

“The majority of the student over-
sight goes toward UCAB,” Gupta said. 
“UCAB mainly deals with facilities 
management and doesn’t have expe-
rience in running programs, so it 
doesn’t seem to make sense that A.S. 
input is minimal.”

A.S. Associate Vice President of 
Academic Affairs and UCAB chair 
Jordan Taylor said UCAB is capable 
of handling the responsibilities. 

“UCAB may deal primarily with 
structures, but we’re more than land-
lords,” Taylor said. “This new pro-
grammatic aspect is a role that UCAB 
is suited for.”

Gupta drafted several amendments 
to the proposal that would change the 
oversight structure to create a stu-
dent majority Loft governing board. 
Members of the board would be 
appointed by students and have gov-
ernance over the Loft’s entire budget.

“If passed, students will be pay-
ing for more than 50 percent of the 
Loft operations, so they need to gain 
governance over the actual execution 
of fees,” Gupta said. “I would like 
oversight over the entire operation.”

Under Gupta’s proposal, college 
councils and student organizations 
would be able to use the Loft space 
for free. 

A.S. Vice President of Student Life 
Riscie Hernandez opposed the over-
sight amendments. 

“A.S. is not good at owning things,” 
Hernandez said. “Our only experi-
ence [is] in budgeting and making 
sure our student fees properly go 
toward what needs to be done.”

Another key issue of debate sur-
rounding the proposal was whether 
it would be placed on the Spring 
Quarter A.S. elections ballot along 
with several other referendums or put 
before students Winter Quarter in the 
form of a special election. 

After concluding that the Loft’s 
current funding is inadequate to last 
the remainder of the year, the com-
mittee originally voted to run the 
referendum Winter Quarter in order 
to provide the venue with additional 
funds by Spring Quarter 2010.

“We’re out of money, and without 
the referendum, we can’t continue 
with our programming,” he said. 

However, Gupta said running a 
Spring Quarter referendum was more 
appropriate. 

“This push for Winter Quarter 

has created a reduced schedule where 
we don’t have enough time to review 
everything,” Gupta said. 

According to Gupta, the hours 
spent discussing the issue were inad-
equate given the weight of the deci-
sion. The committee met a total of 
three times.

“The special committee had 
less than half membership during 
its meetings and only two voting 
members of the council,” Gupta said. 
“The committee failed, and the argu-
ment that it should be approved just 
because it went through a committee 
is ludicrous.”

Taylor was disappointed at the 
decision to postpone a vote on the 
referendum.

“Scare tactics were used to create 
a false sense of urgency that wasn’t 
there,” Taylor said. “Weeks of meet-
ings went into this referendum and so 
much work on the part of individual 
members and UCAB.”

Gupta said more time was needed 
to examine the referendum.

“There were not hours and hours 
of work put into this — there were 
four or five,” Gupta said. “This post-
ponement was the responsible action 
to take.”

Wollesen said that Loft represen-
tatives will continue to campaign for 
the referendum to be on the Spring 
Quarter 2010 ballot.

UCPD officers armed with rubber bullet guns and batons attempted quell protestors at a demonstration outside the UC Board of Regents meeting Nov. 18.



���THE UCSD GUARDIAN� THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 2009�

ON CAMPUS — Nothing makes you 
look more like an asshole than walking 
around with a baby coffee cup. For a 
mere dollar in the honor-system bas-
ket, you can have your own “small” 
coffee at the Mandeville cart, which 
is much tinier than the standard size 
(and cheaper). Heck, the burn-proof 
sleeves don’t even fit (some choose 
to up the douche factor by leaving 
their sleeves awkwardly dangling 
and inverted). Totally impracti-
cal, but that’s not the point. You 
get to drink the best coffee on 
campus and smile like an idiot 
as you strut down Library 
Walk with your “I’m a dick” 
cup. It’s like a midget middle 
finger to conformity. 

— Chris Kokiousis

ON CAMPUS — Traversing a fog-encased UCSD is bound to give you 
goosebumps, especially when goddamn Weather.com misles you into 
wearing a paper-thin tank over skinny jeans. Luckily, the gods of hearth 
have bestowed a snugglicious spot to defrost your cherry nose: Hurry 
along to the Student Center and you’ll find a roomy lounge in Hi-Thai, 
adorned with your grandmother’s maroon armchairs (complete with 

fold-out desktops for overproductive psychos) arranged around a cozy 
fireplace. Larger parties can settle into cushiony booths lining the walls, 

and (albeit second-rate) hot Thai soups are only a hop and a skip away.
— Kelsey Marrujo

OFF CAMPUS — Sick of La Jolla’s impenetrable 
sea mist? Put on your brave face and drive deeper 
into the fog until you reach refuge in downtown 
La Jolla at the Living Room, a tiny little cafe and 
bistro that’s stocked with enough croissant-wiches 
and bread-bowl soups to warm up your stomach 
before you even get to the fun part: the bar. For low-
key drinkers, ask the server on the ground floor to 
splash your OJ with rum. Feeling adventurous? Go 
upstairs for the real deal and splurge on a double 
shot of Patron — guaranteed to slap out the last of 
your shivers. For nonalcoholics, take a seat at one of 
the vintage tables overlooking — you guessed it — 
the ocean, order a few hookahs for your party and 
watch things get steamy.

you’re tired of inebriating

PB, try your thirst at the 
real deal: Aero Club Bar. 
Just a smidgen east of the 
airport off of Interstate 
5 is the befitting digs of 
a historic booze hole. 
Claim a spot at one of 
the huge baroque booths 
or perch yourself at the 
expansive wooden bar 
and pick your poison—
there’s plenty of ways to 
get drunk considering 
Aero Club’s cluttered wall 
of spirits and 20 beers on 
tap. Once you’ve gotten 
comfortable, join a crew 
of drunken San Diegans 
grooving to some juke-
box ditties or sign up for 
a game of pool. Either 
way you’ll have a dive-y 
good time.

ON CAMPUS — OK, 
so it’s not exactly a dive 
bar, but Porter’s has 
a thousand times the 
sketchy-character cred

drown your sorrows on 
campus, there’s no place 
else to be.

Whether you’re suf-

(again) there’s nothing 
like a light hike at Torrey 
Pines State Park. Its fresh 
air and spectacular ocean 
view will give you some 
peace of mind. There are 
also a variety of trails to 
choose from. You can e 
forget your problems via 
exhaustion after a run 
up and down the steeper 
trails that lead to the 
beach. Or take some of 
the easier trails up top for 
peaceful panoramic view 
of La Jolla and Del Mar. 

Beachside parking is 
free in Del Mar, but it’s 
$10 past the visitor’s gate, 
so you might want to just 
walk from campus. There’s 
a south side entrance near 
Scripps Green Hospital, 
just a block away from 
RIMAC and you can 
find clarity from 8 a.m. 
to sunset. After that, just 
tell your roommate to 
shut up.

ON CAMPUS — At some point during the construc-
tion of Pepper Canyon Hall, a particularly enlightened 
group of engineers decided every student should 
have enough desk space to set up a television, two 
toaster ovens and a Stratego board. The result of their 
brave vision was Room 121 — a shining testament to 

personal space in a world of cramped lecture halls, and 
one of the most ideal doodling locales on campus.  

When presented with a writing surface the size of a small 
raft, it becomes difficult for the habitual doodler to remain 
focused on the lecture at hand. The cold gray desktop becomes 
a vast landscape of ink-stained possibility, and absent-minded 
margin scribbling is transformed into an epic 50-minute parade 
of artistic vision. Weird-looking classmates appear as trained 
models, poised magnificently for renderings of their more 
unfortunate features — beady eyes, big ears, tightly pursed lips. 

Room 121’s limitless desk space — paired with exception-
ally comfortable swinging swivel chairs — allows for ultimate 
postural relaxation. Stretch out across your cot-like plane of 
composite wood and indulge in creative catnaps between furi-
ous bursts of cartoonistry. The world is your makeshift college-
ruled sketchbook, and with a desk seemingly designed for 
cartographic readings, the imagination rules.

butcher their native language, dishing 
out flavors from cantaloupe to chocolate 
hazelnut with unfaltering charm. Their 

espresso bar and candlelit outdoor seat-

little more sincere. So, stroll in, throw the staff a 
mispronounced “Bonjeeerno” and reward yourself for being interna-
tional with a cold cup of cantaloupe freeze.

OFF CAMPUS 
— If you have 
long searched for 

a place to capture 
a perfect San Diego 

skyline shot, look no 
further than the Centennial 

Park coast in Coronado. Just northwest 
of the old ferry landing, you will find 
this irresistible view of the San Diego 
skyline pleading to be photographed. It 
doesn’t matter if you’re shooting with a 
dinky iPhone or a 5D Mark II, a snap 
of this skyline will make any amateur 
photographer look like a pro. For the 
best results, photograph the view about 
an hour after sunset. Once you finish, 
just post your photo on Flickr and bask 
in the accolades.

OFF CAMPUS — For a fresh 
finals-week setting, spread out 
at Souplantation, where you can 
attempt the ultimate college chal-
lenge: eat as many meals in a row 
as possible while . Step one: Show 
up when the restaurant opens, fill 
your tray with a tasty breakfast 
and find a discrete corner to make 
your home for the day. Step two: 
Study for a few hours in your nook 
and then go back for lunch. Step 
three: Repeat step 2 for dinner or 
as snack cravings dictate. This off-
campus study spot is the best way 
to save some cash — even if you 
do put on a few pounds after 10 
hours at an all-you-can eat buffet.

OFF CAMPUS — As a diehard Bay Area kid, my first couple of months at UCSD 
were filled with desperate Amoeba Music withdrawals. Luckily, I found a SoCal 
remedy — a slice of hip-hop heaven on Garnet Avenue in Pacific Beach.

Access Music crams a large selection of hip-hop related CDs, vinyl and cloth-
ing into an tight space. Even better than its variety, though, is its staff — a collec-
tion of local deejays and all-around heads that know their hip-hop. If you shoot 
the shit with them enough, they’ll start to get a feel for your tastes and pass along 
stuff you’ve never heard of. If you hang around enough, you’ll also get a chance 
meet artists in-store — the intimate atmosphere practically forces conversations 
with the underground elite.

and venture outside the La Jolla bubble 
to Fourth and Fifth Streets on University 
Avenue, where you’ll find a collection 
of soy-soaked dining options open ’til

won’t be bothered by your vodka-reeking

keep you from spending too much on drunk food. 
A delicious meal’s guaranteed; try the honey walnut

Best for a date: After some elegant evening theater, 
unwind a little at Saigon on Fifth. True, meals are lean 
for their $10 to $20 prices, but at the least chic presen-
tation will score you cool points in lieu of a doorstep 
moment.

Best for vegetarians: For something in between 
the indulgence of Hong Kong and class of Saigon, try 
Asian Bistro. All meals come with vegetarian options 
and range from $6 to $16. Dish names are priceless: 
Thai Me Down, Long Time No Sea and Yum Mama, to

though, chances are, you’ll have a

36 sandwich choices make it worth the journey. 
Hop on the trolley to dowtown, where lunch break’s 
best-kept secret is stashed away in a burgundy Wells 
Fargo high-rise on 4th and B, where you’ll have 
to maneuver through a swarm of suits. Order one 
of Plaza’s $6 sandwiches, or forgo the delicatessen 
staple and opt for a hearty salad. Then slide over to 
the open-air patio to savor your selection above the 
hustle and bustle of the city. The lunch rush line goes 
out the door and into the elevators, so have some 
cash ready for a quick transaction. Lucky for you, the

ON CAMPUS — It’s happened to the best of us: the nauseous morning-after throb. Of 
course, even the mildest hangover is made 10 times worse when you’re forced to emerge 
from your trashed apartment and scurry to class. Good thing Jamba Juice blends a 
quick, refreshing breakfast substitute, packed with vitamins, fiber and other feel-good 
ingredients (especially all-fruit ones). And they’re the best alternative to solid food, if 
even the thought of chewing anything more than three times turns your stomach. But if

wraps. Be sure to end your order with a free boost — perhaps the energy one.

ON CAMPUS — If you’re not lucky enough 
to have access to the elusive grand pianos 
hidden away in music department’s practice 
rooms, try your fingertips at the piano in 
Eleanor Roosevelt College’s Great Hall. While 
most other public pianos on campus have 
broken pedals and missing keys — at the very 
least — this I-House gem can carry a tune. 

But the miracles don’t stop there. The 
piano’s only available when there are no other 
events taking place in Great Hall, which 
means you get it’s broad spacious ceilings and 
expansive space all to yourself. You can get as 
theatrical as you want with Beethoven, or sing 
along to Vanessa Carlton’s “A Thousand Miles” 
without completely embarrassing yourself.

Like most others you’ll find on campus, the 
Great Hall piano is an upright. But if you’re 
looking for something a little speedier, pay a 
visit to the Student Activity Center’s new key-
board in Warren College. That is, as long as 
you don’t mind sharing your space with ping-
pong enthusiasts.

OFF CAMPUS — To test your 
new love interest’s taste for 
adventure — a trait that will 
likely come in handy later on 
— take her to a place that’s all 
about flavor: Punjabi Tandoor. 
Order her the tikka masala (or 
paneer if she’s vegetarian), and 
observe her reaction. The right 
girl won’t hesitate to lump the 
curry over rice, shove it onto 
naan and inhale the whole thing 
in seconds. Listen for noises a 
la “When Harry Met Sally” — 
food this good isn’t far from 
orgasmic.

There are few good things in 
life: sex, drugs, chocolate, and 
Punjabi Tandoor. You deserve 
someone who can appreciate 
each to the fullest. Anyone who 
isn’t head over heels for this 
place is probably wrong for you 
— or, at the very least, is medio-

Months before his assassination by the Nationalists in 
1936, poet/playwright Federico Garcia Lorca wrote his 
last play about a domineering Spanish matriarch and 
her ﬁve adult daughters. After the death of Bernarda 
Alba’s second husband, she imposes a period of 
mourning on the girls. Repressed by their controlling 
mother and her fanatical tyranny of ideology, the only 
salvation in their otherwise intolerable lives are menial 
daily rituals. Under the direction of Jeffrey Wienckowski, 
the adaptation promises to capture Lorca’s avant-
gardism through a surrealist lens. (JB)

I nspired by the true tale of Michael Oher (newcomer Quintin Aaron), “The Blind Side” follows the 
assumedly toughing saga of an impov-
erished black kid adopted by “kind 
Christian white-folk,” giving him 
the opportunity to become a college 
football phenom. The synopsis itself 
should be enough to derail you — but 
we shall continue.

Leigh Anne Touhy (Sandra 
Bullock) plays the Southern belle who 
invites poor Oher into her home — a 
Kathy Lee Gifford clone complete with 
an ear-wrenching Southern accent. 
Touhy’s rather bland family is com-
posed of her husband (the typecast 

Tim McGraw), their underwhelming 
not-quite-bitchy-enough daughter 
Collins and son SJ — the less cute and 
more annoying version of the kid from 
“Jerry Maguire.” 

“Side” is predictable and rife with 
uninspired dialogue, but the great-
est distraction lies in the fact that the 
characters, who are supposed to mir-
ror their real-life counterparts, are free 
of flaw. In fact, it isn’t until a vomitous 
photomontage over the end credits 
that the audience is reminded that 
director John Lee 
Hancock’s film is 
based on actual 
events. Because 
the script doesn’t 
manage any 
engaging conflicts 
or personality 
transformations, 
the audience is left 
both unconvinced

and uninspired. 
Sometimes casting a nobody as 

the protagonist can have an awesome 
outcome — as evidenced by last year’s 
Oscar-winning “Slumdog Millionaire.” 
But the formula only works if that 
nobody can halfway act. It’s difficult 
to determine what to make of Aaron 
as an actor at first, as his character 
doesn’t speak and his face bears little 
emotion. Then he starts talking — 
and all remaining hopes are dashed.

To whom is this supposed to 
appeal? Has Hollywood not pro-
duced enough inspirational under-
dog football flicks with subtle racial 
tension? We all saw “Remember The 
Titans,” liked it well enough and 
wish to never see it reenacted again.

Although its underlying story is 

technically uplifting, the film paints 
every issue as black vs. white, conse-
quently coming off as condescending 
and racist. Heightened melodrama 
takes itself too seriously, never paus-
ing long enough to have real emo-
tional impact — and with maudlin, 
score-driven scenes orchestrated to 
draw out phony feelings, it’s almost 
hard not to feel used.

The film only gets interesting in 
the few moments that Michael reenters 
the ghetto in search of his crack-head 
mother. Sadly, the rest of the plot takes 
place inside a golden-gated, pale-
skinned dream home, as Oher is invit-
ed in one day and magically adopted 
the next. From there, Hancock forces 
us to sit through what feels like an 
entire football game of monotonous 
play-by-plays and southern drawl.

ALBUMREVIEWS

Bon Jovi
The Circle
ISLAND DEF JAM

F reakishly mellow songwriter Norah Jones’ fourth album, The Fall, is lovely and cohesive: Lyrics are intelligent every time, Norah’s voice is rich and pure every time and the 
guitar part is catchy every time. And I do mean every time. 
Over and over again.

Lead single “Chasing Pirates” is built off a repetitive 
bassline, lighthearted and somewhat salsa-inspired. Pair 
with a stock drumbeat and Norah’s honeyed vocals, it’s 
ostensibly a slow-paced, tender love song. But it’s hard to 
be sure. I might have gotten it confused with the 12 other 
cuts on the album, almost all of which rely on a simple bass 
rhythm, sparse drumbeat and soulful lyrics in identical dul-
cet tones. 

Taken separately, each track is well crafted and easy on the 
ears. Combined, they blend into an hour of numbing lounge 
beats that increasingly resemble the type of tin you ignore in 
line at Starbucks.

Come to think of it, that might be what Jones was going for. 
“Young Blood” breaks from the languid, yearning tones 

mold; a quickening and evocative storyline about a vampire 
(what else?) promises intense build-up, but just when we 
crave a full, throaty chorus, the track falls back to its original 
speed and starts to blend into the surrounding sea of mass-
produced love songs.

“It’s Gonna Be” is the breakout star, by sheer dint of being 
the most memorable. Here, that hesitant bass finally fleshes 
out and comes into its own, the beat deep and insistent a la 
“Seven Nation Army.” Norah’s voice turns the charcoal kind of 
smoky and swells in attitude, dragged yowling up and down 
the scale by a zippety piano, gauzy wall-of-sound guitar and 
drum that finally drills past our earlobes. 

The Fall is an atmospheric LP for a cozy night at home. 
Put it on as background for higher thoughts, and enjoy like 
you would a fuzzy Target blanket.

I f you get a patriotic buzz from Budweiser commer-cials, you’ll love Bon Jovi’s The Circle. The all-out gutsy battle cries from a hard-luck 
working-class hero — over a token arena-rock chorus 
— is all still here, frozen in time like a long-forgotten 
TV dinner. The hard edge of defiance Bon Jovi toyed 
with in high-school hit “It’s My Life” is gone, sacri-
ficed in a vain attempt to make good on their pop-
metal roots. Break out the chiseled jaws and disaffect-
ed stares, ’cause it’s time for dude to go hardscrabble 
like only a multimillionaire can.

First single “We Weren’t Born to Follow” has 
— surprise, surprise — Jon Bon Jovi singing about 
the perseverance of the blue-collars. (Because he’s 
one of them, of course). Additional props to good 
ole American boy Tico Torres, who plays a no-frills 
and no-talent drum pattern all through Circle. It’s a 
romp through middle America in all its bland glory, 
complete with “Live Before You Die” — a better-days 
power ballad — and brilliantly named “Fast Cars,” a 
tribute to fellow generation geniuses Coldplay.

Circle takes a much needed violent turn on the 
fifth track “Bullet.” Sure, the chorus is made of the 
same overblown Nickelback pomposity, but with the 
edgy frustration that made “It’s My Life” so appealing 
to the kiddes (choppy guitars, driving rhythm from 
Torres), it’s the first track we can rock out to without 
making sure no one’s looking.

Of course, it’s then back to perfect replicas of big-
hair hits, but without any of the fun. Sure, when “Livin’ 
on a Prayer” comes on, everyone’s going to yell them-
selves hoarse through the chorus — but if Jon tries to 
crowd surf to the latest singles, he’s going to be eating a 
buttload of trampled water bottles.

hit Tokyo, Japan, and Osaka, Japan, 
and Bali. 
G: How were the shows out of the 
country?
H: The shows out of the country are 
beautiful, and they’re so different from 
anything we’re used to experiencing. 
The cultures are so different, so the 
way that they react to our music and 
the way they interpret our music — 
the way that they even move to our 
music — is completely different. It’s 
great to see how other cultures inter-
pret what we do.
G: So you guys just dropped Day 
after Forever in September, five years 
after your previous release Earthtones. 
When did you guys start working on 
this project and what was going on in 
the time in between? 
H: The record is Day After Forever, 
and it’s in keeping with the idea that 
it took so long to make this damn 
record. We’ve been working on this 
for a while, off and on, and also we’ve 
been doing a whole bunch of projects. 
It’s taken a while just because we’ve 
been doing a whole lot of experiment-
ing and kind of just settled back on 
doing what it is that we wanted to do. 
We really wanted to make a timeless 
record. And I think in the end, we 
kind of persevered through it and got 
the songs that made for a solid album. 
G: Since you guys are a hip-hop band, 
you probably hear a lot of compari-
sons between you and the Roots — 
obviously a really famous hip-hop 
band. What do you think about that 
comparison?
H: First off, we all in the band love 
the Roots, and the Roots are insanely 
fresh. I think it’s not like we draw 
specific inspiration from the Roots 
any more than we would A Tribe 
Called Quest or Kanye West or 
Jay-Z — it just so happens that they 
play live instruments. I think we 
have a pretty original take on stay-
ing as an organic, live hip-hop band. 
We’re definitely not going for trying 
to be another version of the Roots, 
because they did it — they did it 
perfect, and they continue to do the 
Roots sound really well. We’re defi-
nitely not trying to step on any toes, 
you know?
G: A couple years ago, you guys actu-
ally played at the pub on our campus 
on 4/20. Do you guys remember any-
thing about the show at all? 
R: Wait, wait, wait… How does that 
room look? Is that, um…
G: It’s kinda like this dark, grungy 
place.
R: Is it rectangular?
G: Sorry, what?
R: Is it rectangular? 
G: Uhhh…
H: Wait, is that the show with 
Persephone’s Bees? 
G: Yeah, they played after you.
H: That was a dope show.
R: Oh, yeah! 
H: There were several dope bands that 
night. But no, that was a great show. 
That was definitely fun — the crowd 
was really live and you know, 4/20.
G: Did you get to celebrate with any of 
the students afterwards?
H: I think some of us did, definitely 
(laughs). 
R: The students down there love 

to get down and have a good time. 
That’s why I love coming down there. 
Everyone’s so ready for it. Some places 
you go, it’s like you really have to 
really, really fight to get everyone into 
it and involved. But I just remember 
everyone ready. Soon as we hit the 
stage it was like, aight, cool, let’s go. 
You know — let’s freakin’ party in 
here.
G: I had a question for Raashan. So 
last week, we had UCSD’s first-ever 
freestyle emcee battle on campus. 
R: Yee-ah.
G: I was wondering if you remember 
your first battle, and what it was like 
for you?
R: Yeah, dang, my first battle…
G: Or any memorable one?
R: If I had to choose my most 
memorable battle, it was when I 
met the original member of Crown 
City Rockers — we used to be called 
Mission. I actually met him in Boston, 
on the street. I moved from Pasadena, 
and the night before, I met some 
emcees and I was freestyling with 
them. They told this guy Moe Pope 
that there was an emcee from Cali 
that was pretty dope and I met him on 
the street and he was like, “Yo, I heard 
you was dope.” I was like, “Yeah, you 
know, I’m cool.” He was like, “Wanna 
battle?” (laughs). I was like, “Yeah.” So 
we just started battling, right there on 
the streets in Boston. And I remember 
there was snow on the ground, and 
I wasn’t used to snow. And like, the 
dude was so ill — we just went back 
and forth, back and forth, and later we 
shook hands and we became a crew 
after that. Which is how I met Crown 
City Rockers: off of that battle with 
Moe Pope. 
G: I’ve seen you guys live before and, 
to say the least, it wasn’t what you 
would expect from an average hip-
hop show. What would you tell people 
to expect from a live Crown City 
show? 
H: Expect the unexpected. Oooooh 
(laughs). It’s a party. Like I was saying, 
if you listen to the record, there’s a lot 
of different kinds of moods. A little bit 
of party stuff and also some introspec-
tive mellow music, and I think when 
we do it live, we really try to blend 
what we do on record and a posi-
tive approach to making music, and 
mix that with keeping it very much a 
party. It’s not gonna be a snoozefest. 
It’s definitely some rip-roarious stuff 
musically, and definitely some fantas-
tic vocalizations by the man Raashan 
Ahmad. 
G: I think that covers everything. Is 
there anything else you guys want to 
add?
H: Check out the Day After Forever 
by Crown City Rockers, and get it any 
way that you need to get it. If you can 
spring the 10 to 15 bucks to buy it, 
then you’re on our Christmas-card list 
forever. We really appreciate the sup-
port and need the support, and if for 
some reason you can’t spring for it, get 
it off the Internet, get it from a homie, 
spread the word and tell a friend.
R: Come to the show. Buy a T-shirt. 
Be on the team. 

Crown City Rockers will perform at the 
Loft with Afterschoolspecial and Mike 
Gao on Nov. 20 at 9 p.m.

18 THE UCSD GUARDIAN� THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 2009� SPORTS

standing taller than 6-feet-4 inches — 
a huge size disadvantage against the 
menacing Aztec frontcourt. However, 
the Tritons stayed aggressive on 
defense and attacked the boards, lim-
iting SDSU to only five second-chance 
points in the first half.

Trailing by as many as eight points 
in the first quarter, UCSD took advan-
tage of their deep bench and capital-
ized on opportunities under the basket 
to inch back into the game. A runner 
from senior guard Tyler Acevedo cut 
the Aztec’s lead to one with only 7:31 
remaining in the first half. Acevedo 
then tied the game just over a minute 
later, hitting a three-pointer off an 
assist from junior guard Casey Ryan 
after a turnover by Aztec guard D.J. 
Gay.

Both teams remained scoreless for 
nearly three minutes before junior 
forward Malcolm Thomas converted 
a fast-break layup opportunity for 
San Diego State with 3:45 remaining 
in the half. The Tritons didn’t score 
again until there was 2:23 left in the 
half, when sophomore forward Scott 
Krizman converted UCSD’s only two 
free-throw opportunities of the first 
half. 

UCSD tied the game again at 1:16 
after junior center Andrew Browning 
put back Krizman’s missed jumper, 
and Ryan followed Acevedo’s steal 
with a jumper of his own. Coming 
out of a timeout tied at 28 — with 
51.6 seconds left before intermission 
— Krizman was called for a foul on 
a defensive rebound attempt, and 
Thomas hit one of two from the line 
for the Aztecs. Thomas then recorded 
a steal and a quick layup to push the 
home lead back to three. 

The Tritons had the last shot 
opportunity of the half, but Acevedo 
missed a potential game-tying three-
pointer and UCSD headed to the lock-
er room down 31-28.

San Diego State scored 17 unan-
swered points to open the second half 
while the Tritons missed their first 
13 shots attempts. UCSD made six 
of their next seven shots from the 
field — three by senior guard Jordan 
Lawley — but the Aztecs maintained 
their advantage. San Diego State led 
by as much as 25 down the stretch and 
held on for the win, improving to 11-0 
all-time against UCSD.

“[We] definitely had some strong 
points early on, but toward the end 
after halftime I thought we fell off a 
little bit,” Acevedo said. “The intensity 
in the first five minutes was pivotal, 
and we didn’t match their intensity.”

The Aztecs — winning a record 
26 games last season and trying for a 
fifth-straight postseason berth — beat 
UCSD despite the absence of their top 
returning scorer, Billy White. 

“We competed for a half; I thought 
we did some good things,” Carlson 
said. “I thought we took way too 
many [three-pointers]. We settled a 
lot for stuff in the perimeter. When 
we attacked the basket, we got some 
good results. I thought we got better 
today. That’s one of the things I was 
really looking to see — whether we 
competed.”

Acevedo led the way for UCSD in 
the exhibition loss, sinking 14 points 
in 24 minutes off the bench. Ryan 
recorded team highs of eight rebounds 
and four assists along with scoring 

eight points. Lawley was UCSD’s sec-
ond leading scorer, putting up nine 
points. Freshman Justin Brue made a 
strong debut for the Tritons, scoring 
six points and grabbing three boards.

“We really got to get after it, because 
now we’re out of the exhibition season 
and now we’re into non-conference,” 
Acevedo said. “We’re growing as the 
season goes along, and today was a big 
learning curve.”

UCSD will head to Pueblo, Co. for 
their first regular-season game of the 
year, taking on Western State College 
on Nov. 20 as part of the Al Kaly 
Classic.

ers having to take on new roles  or 
expanding their existing ones,” said 
head coach Charity Elliot, entering her 
third season with the Tritons. 

“Fortunately, we have great experi-
ence returning in the backcourt. [Our 
returners] have done a great job of 
leading by example, vocally commu-
nicating to our new players what our 
expectations are and setting the stan-
dard for our work ethic.”

According to Elliott, the absence 
of Osier and Gaskin presents the team 
with an opportunity to make positive 
changes. 

 “I really like how our team is devel-
oping so far,” Elliott said. “We’ve got 
three very talented freshmen and three 
transfers who have all done a great job 
of learning our system. I think we have 
a team of players who are willing to 
step up and do their part.”

Earlier this month, Elliott’s squad 
was put to its first test during an exhi-
bition match against national power-
house and premier Division-I program 
Stanford University. Squaring off on 
Nov. 8, UCSD lost in a lopsided 107-55 
game to the Cardinal — who shot 58.3 
percent from the floor.

UCSD, meanwhile, shot 42.4 per-
cent in the first period but struggled 
offensively during the second half, hit-
ting just nine of 43 attempts. At half-
time, UCSD trailed 56-34. Stanford’s 
size and strength proved a challenge 

for the Tritons, and the Cardinal pulled 
away in the second half, hitting the 
century mark with 4:12 left to play.

Carlisle led the Tritons with 20 
points, hauling in five boards and a 
pair of assists. Ilg was the only other 
player to reach double figures for the 
Tritons, totaling 15 points and going 
seven for 14 from the floor. 

“Having the opportunity to play at 
Stanford was a tremendous experience 
for our team,” Elliot said. “We were 
able to play against one of the best 
teams in the country and have some 
small successes.” 

UCSD’s second exhibition game 
against University of San Diego on 
Nov. 14 was a much closer contest, but 
the Tritons ultimately lost 88-69. 

Starting strong on offense, UCSD 
took a 13-0 lead four minutes into the 
first half. Five different players con-
tributed to the team’s solid start, led by 
Carlisle and sophomore guard Daisy 
Feder, who each hit three-pointers.

But the lead was short-lived: The 
Toreros responded with a 16-3 run that 
tied the game at 19-19. 

USD went on to outscore the 
Tritons the rest of the stretch, con-
verting 30 of 53 shots to seal the win. 
UCSD shot just under 38 percent from 
the floor.

“Both teams were able to really 
show us what our weaknesses are,” 
Elliott said about the preseason. “Now, 
it’s time for the [regular] season to 

start, and we are thrilled. We’ve got a 
team of hard workers, overachievers 
and very talented basketball players. It 
may take us a little while to figure out 
our roles, but I think we will be much 
deeper and well-rounded than we have 
been in the past.” 

 In the game against the Toreros, 
Carlisle again led the team with a 
game-high 21 points. Ilg was three-
for-five from three-point range, and 
contributed 10 points. 

“We have taken a lot away from 
our first two exhibition losses,” Ilg said. 
“Stanford showed us we need to work 
on our defensive transition and our 
alertness on defense. USD showed us 
that mental errors or lapses in effort 
— even for a minute — can change the 
momentum of the game.”

For a Triton squad with high 
expectations for the upcoming cam-
paign, a challenging first two games 
helped players prepare for the start of 
the regular season.

“These games also showed us 
our strengths: our half-court offense, 
half-court defense and our speed,” Ilg 
said. “Both of these games were great

UCSD freshman pair Jacquelyn 
Davis and Melissa Breisacher — 
who made their collegiate debuts 
— lost 8-3 to Montana’s Constance 
Alexander and Kayla Morse.

On Saturday, sophomore Katie 
Mulloy fought back from a first-set 
loss to top Santa Clara’s Isabelle Hoy 
in three sets. Hoy won the first set 
7-6 and took a 5-2 lead in the second 
set before Mulloy took 
command of the match. 
Mulloy won the second 
set 7-6 and finished off 
with a 6-3 third-set vic-
tory to finally seal the 
win — which took three 
hours and 30 minutes 
to land.

“I felt pretty good at 
the invitational,” sopho-
more Katie Mulloy said. 
“I had a tough match 
on Saturday. We need 
to continue to practice 
matches, and to make 
the right shot selection 
and the right returns for 
spring.”

Pourmirzaie kept 
up her dominant play, 
earning a second-straight victory at 
the invitational by defeating Irvine’s 
Ali Murphy in a close 7-5, 7-6 deci-
sion.

But the second day of the invita-
tional was filled with a wide variety 
of performances. Athavale defeated 
Riverside senior Roxanna Plata in 
an excellent showing; Bains fell to 
Montana’s Rebecca Bran in a seesaw 

battle 4-6, 6-4, 6-4; Dao was defeat-
ed by Loyola Marymount’s Elisaveta 
Pironkova 6-3, 6-1 and Valerie 
Tang lost to Loyola Marymount’s 
Bliss Nixon 6-1, 6-3. UCSD fresh-
man Jacquelyn Davis, replacing a 
Riverside player who had withdrawn 
from the tournament, lost a close 
match against a Montana challenger 
7-6, 6-4.

In the doubles matches on 
Saturday, the Tritons 
were not able to cap-
ture a single victory. 
Bains and Athavale lost 
to Montana’s Amanda 
Bran and Maddy Soule 
8-4. Tang and Dao were 
also defeated by a Santa 
Clara duo 8-5, while 
Davis and Breisacher 
lost 8-3 to Montana to 
wrap up day two for 
UCSD.

On Sunday, the last 
day of the invitational, 
the Tritons concluded 
their 2009 Fall schedule 
with four victories.

Dao then  defeated  
Montana’s Maddy Soule 
to finish in seventh 

place in the second most compet-
itive singles bracket of the tour-
nament. Similarly, Tang outlasted 
Riverside’s Taylor Raney 7-5, 6-2 to 
finish in seventh place in the third 
most competitive singles bracket of 
the Invitational.

Davis concluded her freshman 
debut with a pair of wins. In her 
singles match, Davis topped Santa 

Clara’s Hoy 6-3, 6-4 to earn her first 
collegiate victory. Later, she teamed 
up with fellow freshman Breisacher 
in the doubles competition to defeat 
the Loyola Marymount pair of Bliss 
Nixon and Maria Garcia-Planas 
Albert 8-4.

In Sunday’s other singles match-
es, Bains was defeated by Riverside’s 
Elena Cadet in the top singles brack-
et 6-7, 6-0, 10-5. Breisacher, who 
took the place of a withdrawn player 
from another team, lost to Montana’s 
Rebecca Bran 6-1, 6-1. Athavale was 
also defeated by Montana’s Heather 
Davidson 6-1, 6-7 and Mulloy was 
topped by Montana’s Kayla Morse 
6-0, 6-2. Rounding out UCSD’s 
singles play at the invitational was 
Pourmirzaie’s 6-1, 6-2 loss to Irvine’s 
Ali Murphy.

Along with Davis and Breisacher’s 
doubles victory, Bains and Athavale 
lost 8-3 to a pair from Irvine, and 
Tang and Dao narrowly lost 8-6 to a 
Riverside duo.

“I think it was a great experience 
for us,” head coach Liz LaPlante said. 
“We came up against very strong 
Division-I competitors. I think we 
performed really well. The invita-
tional gave us indication where to 
make changes. Our goal for spring 
is to win our conference. We would 
like to continue our streak.”

The UCSD women’s tennis team 
returns to action on Feb. 6 at Cal 
State Northridge, opening up their 
spring campaign.

the current Division-II record in 
the 500-meter freestyle event with a 
winning time of 4:59.00. UCSD was 
also boosted by a trio of underclass-
man swimmers: Freshman Bethany 
Dong and sophomores Natasha 
Nguyen and Megan Thomas placed 
second, fourth and fifth respectively.

“The distance athletes did an 
exceptional job this weekend,” 
McGihon said. “In terms of our 
mid-distance programs, we are in 
an up year. We’re getting better, and 
confidence level is rising with the 
more races we swim.”

McGihon knows the team will 
need confidence heading into the 
team’s next meet: the highly com-
petitive Toshiba Classic. Hosted 
by UCSD but held in Long Beach, 
Calif., the three-day meet will begin 
on Nov. 19 and feature some of the 
highest-caliber swim programs on 
the West Coast.

“With the likes of Berkeley and 
Stanford competing, we’ll definitely 
see some high-level swimming,” 
McGihon said. 

On the men’s side, the Tritons 
will compete against 13 teams, 

including the Stanford men’s team, 
which finished third at last year’s 
Division-I National Championships. 
Additionally, UCSD will face Pacific 
Collegiate Swimming Conference 
rivals Cal Baptist University, 
Chapman University, Soka 
University of America and Seattle 
University.

The women’s competitors are no 
less daunting. The Triton swimmers 
will be competing in a field of 26 dif-
ferent teams, highlighted by defend-
ing national champion UC Berkeley 
and several perennial top-50 pro-
grams like Stanford, Hawaii and 
UCLA. UCSD’s in-conference rivals 
Cal Baptist, Chapman, Soka, Alaska 
Fairbanks, Loyola Marymount and 
Pepperdine will also be competing 
at the Classic. 

Coming into the Toshiba Classic, 
the Triton men’s and women’s teams 
boast impressive season records to 
date, and collectively hold seven top 
times across the Division-II nation-
al level.

McGihon said he views this 
upcoming meet as yet anoth-
er opportunity for the Tritons to 
improve. 

“We want to be swimming 
against the best teams and best indi-
viduals as much as we can, so we can 
swim our best now … and toward 
the end of the season,” McGihon 
said. “Swimming against the high-
est level of competition will help us 
reach those goals.”

Barnett-Woods echoed his 
coach’s sentiment, saying he had 
high expectations for himself and 
his teammates coming into the 
Toshiba Classic.

“I expect most of the team to be 
at or [setting their] personal best 
times,” Barnett-Woods said. “I’m 
expecting myself to beat my times 
and make the NCAA A-Cup. Since 
we have such strong competition 
like Stanford and Cal, it will help us 
push ourselves to be our best.”

The Tritons look to continue 
the pursuit of personal records and 
team success against the likes of 
Stanford and Cal in the Toshiba 
Classic from Nov. 19 to Nov. 21 at 
the Belmont Plaza Olympic Pool in 
Long Beach, Calif.

WOMEN’S TENNIS — The UCSD 
women’s tennis team road-tripped 
to the UC Irvine Fall Invitational on 
Nov. 13 for its last competition of the 
fall season. The Tritons played well 
in one of fall’s toughest competitions, 
and saw a couple of players pick up 
respectable seventh-place finishes. 
The tournament featured teams 
from Loyola Marymount University, 
the University of Montana, Santa 
Clara University, UC Irvine and UC 
Riverside.

The Tritons’ lone victory came 
on the first day of the Invitational, as 
junior Roxanna Pourmirzaie defeat-
ed Riverside’s Ayana Simmons 6-2, 
6-4. Pourmirzaie came out of last 
spring’s season with a strong 8-2 
record in singles play, and held up 
her stellar reputation at the Irvine 
tournament.

One of the closest matches of 
the day was between UCSD senior 
Anita Athavale and Irvine junior 
Miranda Young. Young narrowly 
defeated Athavale 6-2, 7-6 in a mara-
thon match. UCSD sophomore Katie 
Mulloy faced Riverside’s Angelique 
Corpuz in another grueling battle, 
but was ultimately defeated 6-4, 
6-2. In the other singles matches on 
Friday, UCSD juniors Taskeen Bains, 
Cindy Dao and Valerie Tang faced 
heavy challenges from Irvine’s No. 1, 
No. 2 and No. 3 singles competitors. 
Despite losing each of their respec-
tive matches, the Triton trio took a 
total of five games from their Irvine 
opponents.

In Friday’s doubles play, Bains 
and Athavale lost 8-2 to the Loyola 
Marymount duo of Jasmin Heckel 
and Elisaveta Pironkov. Similarly, 
Tang and Dao were edged out 8-6 by 
Riverside’s Corpuz and Taylor Raney.

SWIMMING & DIVING — The 
UCSD swimming and diving teams 
fell to UC Santa Barbara on Nov. 
13 in a highly competitive away 
meet where the Triton men’s and 
women’s teams lost 155-96 and 144-
112, respectively.

The meet marked a distinct 
improvement from last year’s com-
petition at Santa Barbara, where 
the Tritons’ Division-I opponents 
cruised to crushing 177.5-75.5 and 
152-109 victories. 

“We have made really good 
strides in terms of comparing the 
two programs,” head coach Scott 
McGihon said. “This year, the gap 
was narrowed considerably and the 
results demonstrated that.”

In particular — on both the men’s 
and women’s side — the Tritons 
were buoyed by the strong perfor-
mance of their distance swimmers. 
For the men, senior Jereme Barnett-
Woods won the 1,000-meter free-
style event with a time of 9:42:84, 
and placed second in the 500-meter 
freestyle heat with a time of 4:42.33.

His results are the latest in a 
string of impressive times for 
Barnett-Woods — a transfer from 
the University of Washington — 
whose time of 9:35.43 in the 1,000-
meter freestyle event against Texas 
Christian University on Nov. 6 
ranks him No. 2 at the Division-II 
national level.

“I’m very pleased with my results 
so far,” Barnett-Woods said. “The 
9:35:43 time and the 1,000 freestyle 
are my season bests. UCSB is a D-I 
school; they are tough to compete 
with, and I think we did a good job.”

The Triton women were equally 
dominant in their distance events, 
as sophomore Alex Henley broke

TRITONS EYE REGIONAL PLAYOFF APPEARANCE UCSD SHOOTS FOR NCAA TOURNEY REPEAT
By Joe Tevelowitz & Cameron Tillisch
Senior Staff Writers

The UCSD men’s basketball team faced off against San Diego State in an exhibition game at the Viejas 
Arena to kickoff the unofficial start of its 
2009-10 season. The Tritons, coming off 
consecutive winning seasons for the first 
time at the Division-II level, hung tough 
with the Aztecs throughout the game’s 
first half before falling behind after inter-
mission. Ultimately, UCSD lost 77-52 to 
its cross-town opponents. 

The Aztecs start their year off 1-0, 
while UCSD will play its first 2009-10 
regular-season games next weekend.

“I think we competed well against a 
team that’s probably the best were going 
to see all year,” head coach of three years 
Chris Carlson said. “We look like a college 
basketball team. I was encouraged by our 
performance today, but we have a long 
way to go.”

The Tritons started the game with 
a lineup in which sophomore center 
Christian Hatch was the only player

As the UCSD women’s basketball team prepares to open their regu-lar season this weekend at Grand 
Canyon University, there’s excitement in 
the air. 

This year’s squad boasts six new faces 
and welcomes back three starters from the 
2008-09 season. 

“We are a completely new team, and I’m 
excited to see what we can do,” senior for-
ward Erin Noonan said. “Everyone on our 
team can come in, make a huge contribution 
and keep the same energy up on the floor 
from the starting group.”

Absent from this year’s squad are former  
center Alexis Gaskin and former forward 
Michelle Osier, two of the team’s leading 
scorers last season. Head coach Charity 
Elliot said she feels that this year’s team will 
have little trouble in making up for last year’s 
graduated seniors.

“Certainly anytime you lose players of 
Michelle Osier and Alexis Gaskin’s caliber, 
there is going to be a process of other play-
