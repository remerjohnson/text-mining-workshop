The Skin Cancer Clinic at the UCSD 

Medical Center has developed a new 
method for removal of basal or 
squamous cell skin cancers that is 
particularly effective in ueating lesions 
on the face and neck. Mohs' 
h istographic surgery, developed by 
Frederick Mohs, MD, from the 
U niversity of Wisconsin, utilizes layered 
mapping of skin cancer lesions in order 
to microscopically control excisions and 
remove cancerous tissue in the most 
effective way with the least amount of 
tissue removak This method is 
particularly effective for recurring 
cancers and those on the nose, ear or 
other facial areas where tissue 
conservation is very important.

Hart's daughter 
visits for votesÂ· 
By SEAN WAGSTAFF 

Appearing at a campaign rally on 
Revelle Plaza Tuesday, Andrea Hart 
spoke on behalf of her father, Gary Hart. 

Gary Hart is trying to win enough 
votes in the remainmg state primaries 
(California's is June 5) to edge past 
Walter Mondale for the Democratic 
nomination . 

Andrea Hart is a 20-year-old 
sophomore and physical anthropology 
major at the University of Maryland . She 
left school last fall to begin making 
appearances in support of her father's 
campaign. 

Hart's speech was directed to 
students. 

The present administration's cutbacks , 
particularly in education, have hurt us, 
Hart said. 

Gary Hart feels students have a right 
to continue their education , and would 
see that educational funds that have 
been cut by the Reagan administration 
should be reinstated to insure that 
students continue to be supplied with 
quality educations, she said. 

Hart described her fa ther as a "person 
with a life-long commitment to politiCS." 

The pres idential candidate began his 
political career as a Sludent volunteer on 
the John Kennedy campaign. In 1974, 
he was elected as a US Senator from 
Colorado. He was re-e1ected in 1980.

staff representing UCSD went to

Asia. The delegation , supponed by a 
campuswide fund-raiSing drive , chose 
lobbying as its method of expressing the 
frustration of the community which it 
represents. Student delegations were 
nothing new on Capitol Hill that week. 
Ever since President Nixon's 
announceme nt of the Cambodian 
invasion, student delegations from all 
over the country have appeared in

Hart was enthusiastic about her 
father'S possibilities of winning the 
presidential race. She warned her 
audience , though , that in order for Hart 
to win, "You must exercise your right to 
vote. 

"We will defeat Ronald Reagan in 
November," Han added. 

The Democrats could have an open 
convention for the first time in decades. 
For this to happen, neither Han, Walter 
Mondale o r Jesse Jackson would win a 
majority of convention delegates. In 
such a situation, the candidates would 
be free to trade votes and campaign 
favors amongst each other. Han feels 
that in an open convention, her father 
would be able to sway voters from the 
Democratic competition to his side. 

Hart's stance on the issues includes 
among others: "strong support for a ' 
nuclear arms freeze and major arsenal 
reductions with the Soviet Union "; a 
halt to military aid for Central America; 
and the c reation of "the best educational 
system in the world ." 

Whether or not Hart's campaign will 
wm him the presidency or even the 
Democratic nomination, for that matter, 
remains to be seen. Andrea Hart's goals 
are clear in the matter, however. "We 
want to send Ronald Reagan back to his 
ranch in California," she said.

Controversy surfaces 
over referendum 
By SEAN WAGSTAFF 

The Student Center referendum, 
which is in its fourth day of balloting. 
may not require a 20% voter turnout 
and simple majority to pass, but instead, 
may reqUire a 25% turnout and rwo-
thirds majority. 

The fact that no one is certain what 
the appropriate ballot figures actually 
are, in the fourth day of a five-day 
voting period, has prompted some to 
suggest mismanagement and 
disorganization in the Sll million-plus 
project. 

On Tuesday, May 21, a memorandum 
was sent from the Committee for 
Responsible Spending to Joe Watson, 

vice chancellor of undergraduate affairs. 
The memorandum pointed out that if 

the Student Center referendum is 
passed, it will impose a mandatory fee 
increase, which has a strictly different 
set of rules than that governing a 
voluntary fee increase .

Jackson address 
at State Capitol 

By JACKIE AFFONSO 
Sacnammto Comspondmt 

Presidential candidate Reverend Jesse 
Jackson accused the United States 
governmem of depriving its own people 
by aiding other nations with American 
military and corporate sUppOrt, at a 
campaign rally in Sacramento last 
Wednesday. . 

Cheers of agreement were heard from 
about 2,000 supporters who gathered on 
the State Capitol lawn to hear Jackson's 
first speech in California. 

Jackson said corporations which 
make so much money and pay Iitde 
taxes should not be allowed to relocate , 
"taking our jobs to Taiwan, South Africa 
and Korea." Likewise, he said, we 
should- not cut aid to American 
education and send it to other 
countries. 

"That's not right," he shouted. 
The government's foreign military and 

trade involvements do not benefit the' 
15% of the nation's hungry, clean the 
air or help children rise up out of the 
ghettos, Jackson said. 

"We must choose feeding not fighting 
... developed minds over guided missiles 
... schools over jails ... the human race 

over the nuclear race," he said, 
Jackson described his leadership as 

one which unites all individuals , 
especially those rejected by socieiy, 
under a spirit of humanity -
"mobilizing them from the bottom up 
and not from the top down . 

"Our nation is off course, we need a 
new course , a new mission and new 
leadership" .. If I'm elected, we'll have an 
environmental protection agency th~t 
will protect the environment and not 
the agents," Jackson said. 

He compared the unionization of 
individuals to rags, which once sewn 
together become a whole piece of cloth , 
a member of SOCiety. 

"There are just too many Americans 
made to feel unwelcome in their own 
home," Jackson said . 

He welcomed aliens , especially 
Hispanics, into the countty. "Hispanics 
must be granted the full citizenship and 
not walk around in the fields all day," 
Jackson said. 

Jackson also urged Americans to 
accept others, as "everybody is 
somebody."

states that for "voluntary fee 
referendums voted during special 
elections, the voring pool shall be 
defined as one-fifth [20%1 or more of 
the affected students registered. A 
majority of those voring must vote in 
favor of the collection fee." 

The Student Center referendum is 
mandatory, not voluntary, but there is 
no reference under Student 
Organizations concerning mandatory 
fees. 

There is a section under Student 
Government which covers the 
procedures for implementing a 
mandatory fee to support a student 
government. It requires that 25% of all 
registered students vote to approve the 
fee , with a two-thirds majority. 

In either case, balloting procedures 
for the Student Center are not covered 
explicitly. 

Reggie Williams of the Committee for 
Responsible Spending (also editor of the 
new indicator) claims that the absence of 
a rule specifically covering the Student 
Center is due to the fact that never 
before has a mandatory fee increase 
been proposed for a non-AS project 

The controversy over the referendum 
was not caused strictly by an unclear 
regulation book, but also by a memo 
distributed by Chancellor Atkinson in 
April of 1981 - five months before the 
regulations book was approved. 

The memo was Atkinson 's response to 
complaints from the AS that because the 
student body took little interest in AS 
funding, the 25% required turnout and 
two-thirds majority support was an 
unrealistic figure . 

Atkinson's memo established a new 
set of "requirements which will ~ide 
our response to referendums on fees." 

The new set of guidelines were as 
follows: 
- an affirmative vote of rwo-thirds or 
more would automatically submit the 
referendum to the Regents for approval ; 
- an affirmative vote of less than rwo-
thirds , but better than 50%, sends the 
referendum to the Chancellor fer 
consideration to be submitted to the 
Regents; 
- for special elections, the voting pool 
must be at least 20% of the student 
population. 

According to Randy Woodard (keeper 
of rules and regulations ), the Atkinson 
memo is the document that was used to 
determine the numbers used for the 
referendum. The Student Center Board 
cited the 20% turnout figure on several 
occasions, and placed it in Guardian 
advertiSing. 

Either no one involved with the 
project knew there were conflicting rules 
in the handbook, or the Student Center 
administration chose to ignore this fact. 

Both possibilities have raised $ome 

Vice-chancellor Joe Watson: "It appears 
as though we have conflicting policieS ... 

eyebrows. Critics claim that for an Sll 
million project, the administration 
should know the rules and follow them 
before putting the issue to vote. 

When the subject came up on 
Tuesday, Watson said , "It appears as 
though we have twO conflicting 
policies." He added that the matter was 
"being investigated: On Wednesday, 
Watson was out of town , and Woodard 
said he hoped to have an answer as to 
the validity of the "20/ 50" rule by Friday 
night. 

Woodard echoed Watson's comment, 
saying, "It certainly shows we've had a 
competing set of rules and regulations: 

Tom Tucker, chairman of the Student 
Center Planning Commission, refused to 
comment on the validity of the 
referendum rules. He referred the 
Guardian to Randy Woodard. 

Tucker also would not speculate as to 
whether the referendum controversy 
would have any effect on the reputation 
of the Student Center administration, 
again , until Woodard's decision. 

Tucker was emphatiC that the 
referendum ballot would be used 
regardless of Woodard's decision, and 
that therefore a turnout of less than 20% 
or more than 25% will guarantee that 
the referendum will either sink or swim 
in that respect. 

When the possibility was suggested to 
Woodard that his decision was being 
postponed until after the elections to 
prevent any possible negative effects on 
the election , he denied it, saying that he 
simply did not have the time to do it 
now. 

"I have a referendum to do, people to 
see and I certainly won't do it after 
hours ," he said.

Editorial 

A horse without a rider 
UCSD students are divided into three categories: 

those with cars and culture, those without cars or 
culture, and those with well-developed legs and 
culture, This situation arises from our campus having 
been plopped down in the middle of Pueblo land, far 
removed from the madding crowd, This is all right 
for academic sweats, and no doubt that is what our 
founders intended us all to be, but for the ordinary 
student, who wishes to attack the humanities 
sequence of life, it is necessary for the campus to be 
within reasonable distance of the purlieus of life. 

Or for .the purlieus of life to be within reasonable 
distance of the campus, and that is what is about to 
happen as part of the Blackhorse Farms project. The 
Young Urban Professional silliness of the name (for 
Yuppies are attracted by whatever appears to be their 
complete antitheSiS, I suppose because it is so 
unpleasant being a Young Urban Professional) leads 
one to suspect that the development wil lack a 
certain reality. However, a surrealistic community 
close to UCSD is better than a real one unattainable 
by the earth-bound. 

Now that we are being surrounded with shopping 
malls and glass walls in La Jolla and what pretends 
very hard to be La Jolla, we hope that UCSD's 
contribution to commercial real estate will, if not

Editor: 

As a student of UCSD, I am 
very surprised about the 
methods, with which the 
University Center 
Planning/Building AdviSOry 
Committee tries to push the 
rderendurn for the University 

.Center through. With an 
expensive, one-sided campaign, 
the UCP/ BAC is rolling over the 
campus, while students with 
objections against the proposal 
are not conceded to use 
students' funds to express their 
opinion, which may differ in 
certain points but not necessarily 
in the need of a student center. 
This advertising is for me the 
most shameful outSide countries 
with an authoritarian or 
totalitarian regime I have ever 
seen. First, students shaU vote for 
a University Center, of which no 
detailed plan is published. I shall 
give a free hand to Tom Tucker 
and his committee to do with 
my parents' money what they 
co nsider to be the best for me. 
Students will have control, is 
said, but the administration has 
the opportunity to wreck a 
proposal with the veto. And I 
shall trust Tom Tucker, who has 
spent $6000 of student money 
for his campaign and the 
polling? Who defends the 
printing of the expensive 
brochures with: "When it comes 
to students, we try to do 
everything as high quality as we 
can"? And what is this man but 
going to do with the millions he 

. expects from the fund raising? 
Second: Generously, the 

chancellor offered one million 
dollar for the proposed chance 
of a University Center. Since the 
center would be a non-academic 
building, the state would nOt 
support the object with any 
means. But from the 
administration , it is regarded "to 
enhance the quality of campus 

life," so that it urges us to vote 
for the fictive center and our 
parents shall subsidize 
restaurants and other commercial 
businesses. The question, what is 
reaUy needed and what is 
superfluous in a University 
Center, is only discussed a very 
little due to a lack and a short 
time, during which the 
comminee has tried to push its 
referendum through. Meeting 
facilities and a 24-hour 
restaurant are needed , is said. 
But why for example is the 
Triton Pub, an existing facility to 
meet people, closed on Saturday 
nights, while we have such an 
urgent problem? And why is it 
impossible to extend the student 
center at a more modest rate 
than to build a new center for 
estimated $12.5 million (and the 
real COSts will be much higher) 
by a fee increase of 200%? 
Third, the students, who vote 
against the referendum, are not 
necessarily against the University 
Center, so far they only express 
their objections against the 
proposal of the UCP/ BAC. In 
The Guardian of May 2L, we 
could read the follOWing 
advertising characterizing these 
students: "Those few individuals 
whose views appear to the left 
chose not to participate in this 
year-long process (where was the 
choice, when the members of the 
comminee were appointed?). 
They are uninvolved, uninformed 
-(that is every student at UCSD) 
representatives of special 
interests directed by a non-
student (is Tom Tucker a 
student?). Their concerns are not 
with the quality of your future 
and the quality of student life at 
UCSD." To defame objectors in 
such a way instead of using 
arguments reminds of defaming 
policies in communist countries, 
where there is only a little 
interest in the people's real 

tasteful, restrained, collegiate and human itself, at 
least contain that which is. If that great public 
enterprise, the student center, turns into a high tech 
burger bar, the private entetprise of Blackhorse Farms 
will be all that is left for pay-as-you-go culture. If this 
development is saddled with the trappings of young 
urban professionalism, it will be merely a closer 
yniversity Towne Centre, probably with the 
accompanying anomalies in spelling. 

Then we can expect a rampant B. Daltonism, 
mercantilism dragged down to the lowest common 
denominator, which is just the denominator that 
appeals to Yuppies. Will retailers realize that students 
require something genuine, something extraordinary, 
to spend their genuinely and extraordinarily hard-
earned money on? Or is that what students require? 
Perhaps UCSD and its surrounding community is 
preparing us for plastic middle classism, or middle-
class plasticism, and perhaps we will not have a 
chance for a last fling before we descend into that 
inferno. 

We were given an instant university, and we are 
about to be handed an instant university community. 
The first was successful, and we have an 
approximation of the genuine article. Let us hope the 
second effort succeeds as well. 

needs. In the same style, we can 
read: "Not a Single student 
organization on this campus 
opposes this referendum." (But 
that does not imply that a single 
one supports it.) and finany: 
"Thousands of students can't be 
wrong!" (The masses, who were 
misled by Hitler could not be 
wrong?) Of course, we already 
came unanimously to a decision, 
and to feign democracy (which 
is necessary for fund raising), we 
will have a vote on the 
referendum. To show the 
students' freedom, we will have 
more voting booths than ever 
before - the result will be clear. 
When , in 1946, the first "free" 
elections were held in the 
German Democratic Republic , in 
many regiOns only one party 
appeared on the baUot due to a 
"mistake" of the printing 
machine . I was lucky that I got 
today one with two options and 
encourage every student, who 
finds rwo options on his ballot, 
to express his abhorrence of the 
authoritarian methods.

are , however, certain given 
things in the educational process 
that do have a crucial impact on 
the way data and information are 
packaged in order for learning to 
occur: choice of curriculum, 
texts , even the sectionmg of the 
year into quarters or semesters, 
and then there is the choosmg 
of professors, perhaps the most 
influential factor an institution 
makes in the dissemination of 

the curriculum it is offering. The 
student body is an integral part 
of this institution, is making 
fairly huge sacrifices in order to 
acquire a useful foundation of 
knowledge with which to 
develop a career or skill, yet 

. seems to have painfuUy little say 
about which professors are 
chosen or retained at this 
University. 

As a huge intracampus protest 
would be a bit out of character 
for the '80s, perhaps a grass 
roots approach would be 
indicated . Recently, a smaU 
group of students nestled at USB 
decided to make a statement 
about the kind of professor 
whose level of caring and 
commitment to his work really 
communicated to them a sense 
of this mysterious quality, 
education. 

The gentleman, Dr. Charles 
Wurrey, is caught in the position 
of being a visiting professor at 
the end of his term here, an 
extension of which does not 
seem possible. The feeling is, 
however, that with enough 
student (Le., you and me) 
support, there is a good chance 
that the administrators-that-be 
could be persuaded to offer Dr. 
Wurreya tenured position. To 
this end, a petition board is 
being set up directly outside USB 
2722 to gather the signatures of 
students who either know Dr. 
Wurrey or who are interested in 
making a statement about the 
kind of education they are 
receiving at UCSD. Contribution 
of this sort is more than just 
putting out energy and time - it 
is an expression of one's feelings 
about oneself - that you as an 
individual are able, that you do 
have the level of ability and drive 
to make a difference in the 
environmont you are interacting 
in. This is not a membership 
drive or a voting poll. What we 
are talking about is something 
intimately connected with your 
future and your career. You alone 
set your priorities. Tell me, where 
does five minutes fit in against 
the quality of instruction you are 
exposed to?

Premedical blues 
By AMY ROBINSON 

A major goal of the university is to 
teach students to think criticaUy about 
different issues, and this is especially 
important regarding health care. A broad 
perspective enables us to become better 
consumers, and it also helps us to 
deliver more effective care as 
professionals. This statement is 
significant in light of the recent fate of 
UCSD's Health Professions Program (HP), 
which is due to close its doors on June 29. 

HP encourages students to learn about 
the social aspects of health care through 
academic work and many other 
experiences. The program began five 
years ago as an experiment in 
premedical education, with a $375,000 
grant from the Commonwealth Fund. 
This money has supported a two-person 
staff, Andrea Hattersley and Molly Ann 
McCarren, in addition to funding the 
entire program. A year-long efOrt to . 
obtain funding failed, and UCSD has 
decided not to fund the program. The 
current trend is to reduce funding of 
premedical programs due to the 
projected surplus of physicians in the 
next decade. UCSD apparently feels that 
many of the program's functions are al-
ready covered by other depanments. HP 
itself takes an interdepanmental approach, 
perhaps incapable of being accommo-
dated by our conservative institution. 

HP has never been aU things to all 
pre-health professionals, but it has 
fostered exploration by many of us in 
health Issues. If you like concrete 
measures of success, consider the fact 
that LOO% of all program applicants to 
medical schools have been accepted, 
throughout the duration of the program. 
AdditionaUy, our minority representation 
is proportionately double that of the 
UCSD population. But the greatest 
benefits of the program are qualitative. 
This is the tragedy of lOSing the 
program: Regardless of the expected 
surplus of doctors in the next decade, 
there will always be a shortage of 
flexible and well-informed health 
profeSSionals. Each patient is unique, . 
and only professionals who perceive 
this as a decisive influence in treatment 
will seek to understand the patient from 
many angles. Resolution of health policy 
issues as well as ethical dilemmas also re-
quires awareness of many social issues. 

Full participation in the program has 
consisted of completion of the Health 
Care/Sodal Issues minor, at least six 
months of volunteer wQrk, an academic 
internship, attendance at HP functions 
and regular advising. The program has 
additionany included special courses 
and publishes a weekly newslener. 

Two of the most valuable components 
of the program have been the potluck 
dinners and peer interaction. About 

three times each quarter we have had 
guest speakers talk about issues in 
health care at a dinner. We also hear 
about the daily chaUenges and sacrifices 
these people face in their jobs. The 
other great benefit has been the contact 
with students of similar goals and 
interests. It is nor enough to see the 
same people in the same classes to get 
the opportunity to exchange ideas. At 
the potlucks we have the time and encour-
agement to get to know each other. 

Yet this brief description of the 
program does not convey its essence. 
Staff commitment to broad pre-health 
professional education has been 
invaluable. Molly Ann and Andrea have 
learned about our concerns, from 
choosing professors to preparing for 
graduate schools. Whenever possible, 
they have shared their knowledge 
regarding our questions,' and they have 
often referred us to other students. 
Moreover, they have urged us to develop 
our unique interests in health care, not 
limiting ourselves to traditional 
experiences. The counseling they have 
offered meets our needs by bridging the 
gap berween our UCSD education and 
our career goals. This form of couseling 
is unique, since the colleges seem to 
specialize in academic requirements 
while the Health Sciences Advisory 
Program emphasizes career and 
graduate school preparation. 

It is too late to save the program, but 
we are forming a student organization to 
salvage some of the program's vital 
elements. We will be called HIPO -
Health Issues and Professions 
Organization. We have determined t~at 
our purposes will b~ to inform students 
about various health profeSSiOns, to 
foster academic and experiential 
breadth, to foster peer interaction , to 
stimulate interest in health fields among 
students who are underrepresented in 
health care, and to expose students to 
social problems in medicine. Our 
headquarters wiD be Warren Campu~ 
Building 406, OfIice of Special Academic 
Programs (SAP). The Health Care/ Social 
Issues minor will remain available to all 
students independent of HIP(} 

The success of HIPO will depend 
upon the enthusiasm of aU current HP 
students. Continuing suppor:r o[ our 
faculty advisors will lend credibility and 
momentum to our efforts. To all students 
interested in careers in he<tlth or in 
learning more about health care, please 
look for our ads next year, come to our 
functions, and seek us out at the SAP 
ofIice on Warren if you want to get 
involved early on. Participation in HIPO 
wiU enhance our UCSD experience and 
help us to make sense of our diverse, 
often impersonal health care system.

Commentary 

Madding class crowds 
By WElTE KIRAZIAN 

In grades one through 12, classroom 
size is relatively smaU. The teacher 
knows each student, works closely with 
small groups daily, and soon forms a 
productive relationship with them. Years 
later, however, when the student enters 
college, this relationship and daily 
interaction decreases dramaticaUy. The 
teacher is now a mysterious, often 
unapproachable person who stands in 
front of the lecture hall and talks for 

. three hours a week. The student is now 
surrounded by 300 Qthers, most of 
whom he will ~ever know or speak to. 
This system of large class size, prevalent 
in most of our major universities, is 
detrimental to the students' education . 
Small class size is essential for the 
optimum learning experience. 

For most students, the transition from 
secondary school to the university is 
difficult. College classes are challenging, 
the material is new, and the school is 
big. Because this transition is a crucial 
time for the new student, classes should 
have a relaxed, open , intimate atmosphere 
- one that is more conducive to learning. 

Yet It is in these general education or 
required classes that often several hundred 
students are enrolled. With so many 
people in the class,leaming is difficult for 
both new and experienced stu~ents. 

There are other related problems. 
Lecture halls are large , and students 
must often get there early if they want a 
seat. Perhaps the professor wiU use a 
microphone, so even the last rows will 
be able to hear him. The students in the 
first few rows can see and hear the 
professor clearly. They can also decipher 
th!! writipg on the chalkboard. However, 
a studeru forced to sit in the back of the 
room has difficulty with these three 
things, and in fact is often surprised by 
the instructor's real facial features when 
he finaUy sees them up close. It is easier 
to concentrate when you can watch your 
professor's expressions and movements 
rather than focusing on the person's 
head in front of you and straining to 
hear the voice that fIlls the room. 

Perhaps the most important 
component in learning is the student's 
ability to interact in the classroom. A 
student must be able to ask questions 
freely, in order to fully understand the 
material. In a large class, few students 
feel comfortable interrupting the 
professor and yelling out a question over 

,the heads of 300 people. The question 
may be a challenging one or a simple 
"dumb" question. Both are important. 
Because students, for any of these 
reasons, do not ask questions, they miss 
a lot, and professors either will not or 
cannot suggest related topiCS that might 
clarify the concept. 

In a smaUer class, on the other hand, 

students have the opportunity to ask 
questions freely, spontaneously. Because 
of the small size of the room and the 
fewness of students. the teacher and 
students can interact and move along at 
a comfortable pace. In this situation, . 
students are able to interrupt and vOIce 
their thoughts and questiOns, achieving 
fuller understanding. As a result, the 
students' grades are better, but more 
important, they are interested, even 
stimulated by this learning experience. 

Many schools have smaU "sections" 
led by TAs, which supplement the large 
lecrures. These are periods where 
students ask questiOns of their teaching 
assistants. Unfortunately, this option 
does not serve its purpose and cannot 
substitute for having a smaller class with 
a professor. For example , the section 
only meets once a week and should 
cover the' material of the whole week's 
lectures. The hour is usually either a 
waste of time, resulting in students not 
attending, or a lack of time, since aU the 
material and questiOns cannot be 
covered in one hour. Even the interaction 
which does occur in the section is not with 
the source of the subject or lecture, the pro-
fessor. Class size should be kept smaU so 
the professor and student can interact, 
and help each other to grow. 

Few students get to know their 
professors. They are either intimidated, 
uncomfortable or do not have the time 
to go to every office hour. Often, the 
professors are hard to reach. They are 
busy with their own work and are not 
always in their offices during conference 
hours. This makes it nearly impossible 
for a student to get to know a professor, 
or to clarify difficult concepts. 

I n a large class, the students are 
simply known as numbers. Each is 
merely a face in a' crowd and is not 
distinguished as an individuaL The 
professor addresses the class, and 
grades are often posted by ID number. 
The students are branded with their 
number and cannot pick up grades, 
checks, tests , etcetera, without it. 

To proVide an enjoyable , beneficial 
learning experience, class size must be 
small. There must be freedom and 
opportunity to hold discussions and ask 
questions in an open, spontaneous 
manner. This will enable the student to 
fuUy comprehend the lecture as well as 
expand into new horizons of learning. 

The editorial in Monday'S Guardian im-
plied that the $2 million of fund-raising 
committed to the proposed University 
Center would be raised solely by student 
effortS. According to administration 
sources, this may not be the case, as stu-
dents will assist only in fund-raising.

Arms and the mali 
By DAVID WOLF 

Defense spending is a [Opic that is on 
everybody's \ips today, and as the pillar 
of the Reagan Administration, it has 
received much attention in Congress 
and in the press. Much has come from 
bOlh sources about how the military is 
guilty of mismanagement and 
overspending on a gross scale. What 
receives little or no attention . however. 
is how the time-honored custom of 
compromise through budget cuts and 
politicizing the Pentagon procurement 
programs is leaving the American 
fi ghting man up the creek at the hands 
of h is own government. 

Whether or not you agree with the 
great expenditures being made in the 
realm of defense , and whether or not 
you agree with the construction of 
strategic nuclear weapons systems, 
matters not at all here. I am not asking 
you to consider the morality of building 
bombs, rather that you look at where 
some of the Pentagon fat is being cut 
directly from the hides of US soldiers, 
sailors, airmen and Marines. 

Compromise with costs on 
conventional weapons programs is 
unwise in both the human sense of the 
word and in the fiscal sense . Great 
Britain learned that lesson the hard way 
during the Falklands crisis of 1982. The 
HMS In vincible, providing the sole 
aircover for the fleet , could nOl even 
embark a standard sized squadron of 
aircraft. The HMS Sheffield, tragic victim 
of an Argentine air-to-surface missile , 
had suffered budget cuts during her 
construction that eliminated a highly 

effective missile defense system that 
could have saved her in the conOict. 

Here in the United States, it is hard 
for a civilian. without military 
experience, [0 comprehend the 
difference that a little extra performance 
or protection can make on a battlefield. 
Lebanon offered some experience with 
Naval aircraft. Robert Goodman, the 
pilot shot down by Syrian deployed 
antiaircraft missles as his fighter 
overflew the Lebanese Shouf mountains, 
was Ilying an aircraft that many military 
analysts called obsolete . The only reason 
Goodman was flying the A-6 was that 
procurement of a modem craft with the 
abiliry to survive such threats was 
delayed by a Congress that saw a 
"perfectly good" bomber already 
deployed. 

The Gruman F-14, now the Navy's 
main carrier-borne fighter, was the 
victim of budget-conscious pencil 
pushers. As a result, the aircraft was 
underpowered when originally delivered 
and is at present having to go through 
the long. expensIve ' process of 
retrofitting the proper engines. It is 
clearly ridiculous to spend $10 million 
to $20 million on an aircraft and wind 
up with an underpowered facsimile 
because somebody in the Armed 
Services Committee decided to go for 
the cheaper engine. 

Much as I am certain that there are 
admirals who would like to think so, the 
Navy is not the only service that is 
getting its talons clipped. The Army is 
the recipient of some pretty shoddy

deals, too. Much comruversy has been 
raised about the procurement of the M-
16 rille, the standard sidearm of the 
se rvices and attributed killer of many 
American soldiers in its initial years in 
Vietnam. It seems that when originally 
designed . the M-16 was intended for 
ammunition with a certain type of 
powder. Congress authorized 
procurement for the weapon in the mid-
'60s , but did not authorize procurement 
for the correct ammunition. The 
ammunition used tended to leave 
depOSits inside the weapon that caused 
it [0 frequently jam in combat. The M-16 
is alright now, having gone through two 
major design modifications and millions 
of dollars worth of rrials. But it should 
have been ready for combat when it was 
sem there. 

Another program pushed heavily by 
the Pentagon in the 70s was the need 
for an armored vehicle that a squad of 
infantrymen could fight from while 
being protected from small-arms fire 
themselves. What the Army got after 
years of bids and counterbids was a 
vehicle that carries six instead of nine 
infantrymen and has negligible 
protection from nuclear, biolOgical and 
chemical weapons. By comparison, the 
Soviet Union has a vehicle that can 
drive through an area contaminated by 
any or all of those weapons and protect 
the inhabitants from any harm. 

There is a very popular school of 
thought among Americans that the next 
war will be a strategic thermonuclear 
exchange, and so the soldier and aD of 
his conventional weapons are obsolete. 
That sort of thinking is as preposterous 
as thinking that war is abolished. First, 
since August 9. 1945. there have been 
more than 140 wars worldwide, 
according to the book War in Peace. 
Second, the purpose of war is not 
wanton destruction, rather it is a means 
to political end . Because of this, war, 
police actions, incidents, border actions, 

regional hotspots and hostile actions are 
nothing more than political tools. War is 
violence directed at some group or 
country aimed at forcing capitulation on 
a political point. This has been the case 
since man crawled out of caves, and it 
is still the case under the nuclear 
umbrella. The soldier is not obsolete, 
even though he is no longer the ultimate 
weapon at man's disposal. 
Understanding this, you can understand 
why there are still people in uniform 
that perform the function of national 
defense. 

In order to keep down the COStS of 
national defense, the bidding on 
military procurement projects, whether it 
be on uniforms. Illnks. or shipbuilding, 
is geared so that the project goes to the 
lowest bidder. This is plainly wrong. In 
cases like the F-14, the M-16, the new 
Infantry Fighting Vehicle and similar 
programs. the government ends up 
spending more money bringing the 
equipment up [0 standards after it has 
been delivered than it would have cost 
if it had been done right in the first 
place. Instead, [0 get the bid, the 
company involved cuts corners where it 
can. often where it should not .. The 
Congress, under pressure from the folks 
at home to cut spending, tells the 
Pentagon [0 accept that'low bid. and the 
low bidder gets the contract. Sometimes 
it works. 

When the process does nO! work, the 
lirde guy, the soldier, the sailor or the 
Marine. gets left holding the bag. Please. 
when you correspond with your 
legisla[Or. let him know how you feel. 
CUt the budget if you have lO, but do it 
Wisely. Many members of the Armed 
Services committees have never been 
there, and most UCSD students will 
never have lo. But both legislators must 
understand that when you crack down 
on the Pentagon, you have to make sure 
that you leave America's Qefenders with 
a fighting chance.

UNIVERSITY TOWNE CENTRE - 455-0420 

The UniverSity-:-owned, strongly 
contested Blackhorse FamlS project 
By PAUl lAZERSON 

A nother baale In the conl1nuina fiaht helMen UCSD and a number of La jolla community groups over the proposed BI8cIchone Farms &t 
Centre development of the University owned La jolla 
Farms "Slllbles" area will begin today, when the San Diego 
City P,lannin.s Commission hears arguments in favor of 
and opposed to the projecl The commission is expected 
to continue the hearing until late June, when it will rerum 
its final judgement to the San Diego City Council. 

The main point of contention between UCSD and 
the community is the type of development now on the 

Excerpts from letters 
of protest against 
Blackhorse Farms 

"No comment has been made in the EIR 
IEnvironmental Impact Reponl with respect [0 the 
impact of said agreement, and no comment has been 
made with respect to the mitigation of said impact in 
respect to the matters of whether or not the use of said 
contiguous prop~rty may be. obnoxious or 
detrimental to Salk s property or tts permUted use. 
Without limiting the foregoing, the impacts which 
may be obnoxious or detrimental to Salk's property or 
its permitted use could involve the area of obnoxious 
noises and smells, obnoxious traffic circulation and 
smells and the disposition of accumulated surface 
waters resulting from the development of said 
projecl" 

"The severity of the impact does not have to be 
hypothecated since there is a precedent that 
demonstrates the problem." 

"... the traffic nuisance will convert this peaceful 
area into an un liveable jungle. The land value will 
collapse , too." 

"I returned from East Germany a shon time ago, 
where I buried my mother and stayed with my 
brother. Again 1 experienced the absence of freedom 
of choice the people who live there deal with 
everyday of their lives. The government behind the 
Iron Curtain is in full command, caring nothing about 
its citi~ens. caring only for control. 

"The ~ imilarity of a communist government th~t 
cares nothing about its people in their decisions, ana 
the University, which does not give a damn about us. 
is simply alarming! 

"Are we to be bulldozed simply because the power 
we are opposing is greater, bigger, omnipotent? Shall 
we simply be squelched by the obscene power of the 
University? As I read, Miss Angela Davis will be a guest 
speaker at our "dear" University. She will explain her 
ideas on how to establish a different kind of order by 
destroying anything that exists. That, of course. is 
terrorism!" 

"Nor does the fact that the Farms homes are 
expensive act as a sound argument that there be low 
income hOUSing via wwnhomes. One should have 
nothing to do with the other!" 

:\f'lrt ld ltHI'\ I'lItt"' R .. ;III 

drawing board for the H-acre site. Blackhorse Farms 
would include townhomes, office space, retail 
shopping, a conference center, two single-family 
dwellings and a research/ development park. UCSD 
and the Regents of the University of California are in 
favor of the proposal because of its income-prodUCing 
potential. Many La jollans are against it on the grounds 
that it violates all existing zoning regula lions and 
community plans. 

The actors in this development drama Jnclude:. The 
California State Legislarure. which directed the Regents 
to put the property into revenue-producing use; UCSD 
Chancellor Richard Atkinson, who is also a strong 
proponent of me project; and the developer, the 
Sickles, O'Brien Development Group. 

Opponents of the project are numerous and vocal. 
The La jolla Town Council , Lajo11ans Inc. , the La Jolla 
Shores Association. The LaJoila Farms Property 
Owners Association, the University City Planning 
Group and many residents of the La Jolla Farms 
subdivision are all on record against this planned, 
mixed-use project. 

On Friday, May 18. the San Diego City Planning 
Depanment issued its repon for the planning 
commission that recommended the proposal be denied 
because of what the planning department calls the 
"inappropriateness of the proposed Research and 
Development Component in close proximity 10 the 
adjacent residential neighborhood." The planners also 
found that the project would "contribute to the 
degradation of air quality in the region ," and this 
problem could only be mitigated through "a lower 
density lor different land usel alternative. such as a 
residential use." 

The planning department gave C9nditional approval 
to a modified plan in which the research and 
development facility would be replaced with additio!lal 
townhomes. but the devdoper will not consider this 
alternative until the original proposal has been formaDy 
disapproved. It is also unlikely that opposition groups 
would be satisfied with any project that deviates from 
the existing, low-density residential-use zoning that is 
now in effect for the site. â¢ 

In 1967, the Regents acquired 130 acres of land 
within and adjacent to the La Jolla Farms subdivision 
[rom the founder of the area, William Black. From 
1967 until 1975, when former chancellor McElroy 
began a review of possible uses for the Stables site, 
UCSD leased the land to John lipari , who managed 
the property as a horse stables facility. In ~ 979, he fell 
behind on his lease payments and was eVicted. 

Following McElroy's decision to examine various 
uses of the Slllbles, the UCSD Board of Overseers said 
in late December, 1975, "The University should 
maiqtain ownership to serve both campus and 
community interests .... P:reliminary investigations 
indicate a multi-use development of the subject 
property is f~sible, as judged from an analysis by 
professional commercial interests. Should some form of 
development prove appropriate, a phased program is 
desirable with detailed studies required to prodoce a 
specific phasing plan. All options including 
maintenance of open space on the site should be fuBy 
explored prior to any determination of usage." 

In february, 1978, the Office of the California 
Auditor General reported to the Slate's joint l..e$islative 
Audit Committee that the Slllbles had no apparent

academic use and should be managed to provide 
UCSD with revenue. The Legislature then notified the 
Regents and UCSD to provide the State with a plan for 
sale of all land not needed for academic purposes. 

Although the Legislature's call for the Regents to 
generate income from property not being used for 
acadernic purposes is a weighty directive coming from 
the body that controls the purse strings for the 
University of California system, it is not a mandate. 
The Legislature does not have the power to fprce the 
Regents to use their lands for any specific purpose. 

ActiVity aimed at gening the Stables property onto 
the tax roles and generating income for UCSD began 
in earnest in januaty, 1981 , when the Regents 
deSignated the Stables parcel as an Inclusion Area (an 
Inclusion Area is a parcel of University-owned land 
that is intended to be developed to 'meet non-
academic campus needs) and sent out a Request for 
Proposals (RFP) for development of the land. 

Concurrent to designating the Stables an Inclusion 
Area. the Regents. acting unhappily on a 
recommendation from UCSD, put the 24.5 acre "Knoll" 
parcel of land - located within the La Jolla Farms 
subdivision - into the trusteeship of the University'S 
Natural Land and Water Reserves System (NLWRS), 
where it is protected from development. 

Before the Regents would aDow the Knoll to be put 
into reserve. they directed UCSD to do a market 
analysis of the value of the property. Bernys Borun, 
vice president of the Keith Brownell Co., Inc., stated in 
his appraisal. "Reasonable highest and best use of 
residential development of the land in private 
ownership Iwould gross from salel : $3,750,000'-

Despite the Regents' objections, UCSD got its way, 
and the Knoll is now a protected area. Its status comes 
up for periodic review, but Atkinson said that to his

knowledge, no land once designated 
into NLWRS has ever been removed 
from it. 

At roughly the .same time that the 
Knoll was being put into reserve, more 
than 60 developers were being sent 
RFP's from the Regents regarding the 
Stables property. The response was light: 
the Regents received only one bid. 

The proposal - Sickles, O'Brien's 
Blackhorse Fanus - was accepted by 
the Regents and an ad hoc panel of 
UCSD faculty, Staff and students as 
conforming to the requirements, both in 
tenus of economic return and type of 
use consistent with the expectations of 
the interested parties. Following 
acceptance of the proposal, the 
developer bought a three-year option to 
build on the property, and today's 
planning commission hearing is another 
Step in the process of gaining final 
approval for the project. 

Is UCSD gening its money's worth 
from the Stables property? 

Jack Shappell, assistant treasurer of 
real estate for (he Office of the Treasurer 
of the Regents, said he did not have a 
precise dollar amount for the return the 
Regents expected to get before sending 
out RFP's. He did say, "The Blackhorse ' 
Farms bid was very close to our 
expectations for return on the Stables 
property. It was acceptable." He said 
that only one bid was received because 
of tight money and a sluggish real estate 
market at the time of the bidding. 
Opponents of the project contend that 
the poor response to the Regents' 
request for bids was because of the 
known opposition to any variance in 
the present zoning. . 

UCSD's primary reason for wanting 
the project is income. Already, the 
developer has paid the University a 
non-refundable, three-year option 
payment of S1 ,575,OOO which gives 
Sickles, O'Brien three years to develop 
the property. If they are rejected, the 
money is UCSD's to keep. Major 
funding for the construction of Peterson 
Hall was obtained from this option 
payment. 

If Blackhorse Farms is constructed as 
originally planned with the research and 
development facility included, UCSD 
will be paid a base rent of $1.050,000 
annually for/the ftrSt 25 years of the 55-
year groundlease. At the beginning of 
the 26th year, the base rent will be 
recomputed. An appraisal will be done 
at that time, with UCSD's base rent 
becoming 12% of the new appraised 
worth. If real estate values continue to 
rise , this could greatly escalate UCSD's 
income from the project. 

There are two other escalation clauses 
in the contract, neither of whicR is 
likely to bring UCSD signiftcantly more 
income than the base rent. 

Every five years the Consumer Price 
Index (CPI) will be examined for the 
Los Angeles/Long Beach area. If in the 
paSt five years it has risen, UCSD will 
get about 51.5% of that increase added 
on to the base rent. So If (he CPI goes 
up 35% between 1985 and 1990, UCSD 
will get about half of that, a 17.5% 

increase in rent for the five-year period. 
The othet clause that could provide 

UCSD with more rent specifically 
involves the conference center 
component of the project. For the 
purposes of the lease, each component 
of the project is assigned its own base 
rent. The conference center is tagged at 
$450.000 with the rest of the project 
valued at 5600,000. If 4.2% of the 
conference center's gross income 
exceeds S450,OOO, the University will 
receive the higher figure . 

Based on research about other, similar 
conference centers, it is doubtful that 
UCSD will get more money from this 
clause. The Scanticon Cen~r in 
Princeton, New Jersey is often cited by 
the developer as a model for the center 
here. Richard Harrison, corporate 
controller for Scanticon, Stated that he . 
estimates roughly 550,000 of i{lcome per 
room, per year being generated at 
Scanticon. 

If the conference center here got the 
same renirn on its rooms - the 
proposal calls for 210 rooms total - the 
gross income from the center wouJd be 
510,500,000 per year. Taf<ing 4.2% of 
this figure, it comes out to $441,000, 
which does not exceed the base rent 
figure and would not add to UCSD's 
income from the project. 

The UCSD adminiStration has also 
considered the lack of convenient 
shopping within walking distance of the 
campus as a good reason to put retail 
facilities on the Stables site. However, 
Atkinson has not pushed for direct 
linkages between UCSD and the project, 
something the planning department has 
liSted as a necessity if the project is to 
gain approval. 

In its report, the department says that 
the project should guarantee Student 
employment, offer UCSD use of the 
meeting facilities at the conference at 
reduced rates during slower months and 
delineate specificaDy which relail shops 
win be conmined in the commercial 
com(lOnent with the provision that they 
be affordable for student shoppers. It is 
clear that UCSD has balked at pushing 
for these provisions because any 
restrictions put on the development are 
likely to reduce the income stream 
coming to the University. Whether the 
project can gain approval without 
adhering to the department's 
suggestiOns is not clear now. 

Opponents of Blackhorse Fanus are 
against the project on every count. They 
contend that the changes in zoning will 
destroy the rural character of the Fanus 
with traffic congestion, noise, smog, 
erosion and lowered visual appeal . 

Their campaign could well be called 
Â· Paper Wars" for the vast amount of 
material they have produced In 
opposition to the project. One letter 
from a disgruntled resident of La Jolla 
Farms covered more than twenty pages 
(including resfonses) of the 
Environmenta Impact Repon (EIR). In 
all , more than 35 individualleners were 
submitted against the project's approval 
in the 45-day mandatory review period 
between the release of the initial EIR 
and its final copy.

There once was a man who screamed. 

When he woke up in the morning he 
screamed pterodactyl noises as he 
kicked off the bed covers. Aotsam and 
jetsam of sleep rubbed out of eyes 
signaled another scream. 

Crawling out of bed, he grabbed his 
first throat lozenge of the day from his 
bedside table botde. There was still an 
ample supply - only two, three 
banshee awakenings in the pre-dawn. 

At 6 am, he dressed in his blue 
business suit, only a muffied whimper 1 
escaping. EEEEEAAMAHHHHH! - he 
undressed. He forgot to shower and 
shave. Screaming naked, he ran to the 
bathroom and slammed the door. 

He growl/ scream/ moaned as his body 
came just a litde more alive. In the 
shower - short, fast shrieking as cold, 
wet jets hit him 
broadside/ backside/ frontside broke 
away the inflictions his body had 
commined against him yesterday; he 
screamed at those inflictions as they 
dribbled down the drain with excessive 
soap, chasing into hiding an unwanted 
sexuality. He felt almost untense. He let 
off another scream just for joy. 

Blue suit , shiny black shoes, once 
again on - time for another VISit with 
the automatic coffee machine, a full , 
black pot painfully hot. He screamed 
with delight, dumping a cup of sugar 
and a cup of cream in, and drank it all 
down in one burning, gurgling minute . 
He screamed from his stomach to his 
esophagus this time . 
EEEEEAAMAHHHHH! 

He walked out the door and 
screamed as a red-orange-yellow-purple 

sunrise greeted him. 
He screamed as he locked his front 

door. 
He screamed as he started his car. 
He screamed all the way to his office: 

on the freeway, at the intersection, in 
the parking tower. 

In the elevator, he popped 
mentholated throat lozenges one after 
another. This was his quiet time, time to 
meditate on the d~y ahead, on the 
screams he'd bring into momentary 
existence, on their echos, bounding off 
walls and receptioniSts. 

The elevator doors opened without so 
much as a squeak or a plaStic ruStle. His 
employees looked up, perfectly dressed, 
perfectly groomed. 

On each desk was one standard 
police issue megaphone, each turned up 
to full volume. Each employee picked up 
a megaphone and aimed at the now 
open elevator doors. Each employee put 
on a set of Aviation Mechanics 
earphones 

BOOP! BOOP! BOOP! came from 25 
megaphones. turning on. 

"GOOD MORNING SIR!" blared 25 
megaphones. 

He screamed for a full ten minutes, 
giving details for the day. He was still 
screaming as he slammed the foot-thick 
oak door to his office. His employees 
could stiD hear a muffied scream, 
something like what one hears near the 
roller coaster in an amusement park, as 
he cut into his company's satellite 
communication system and began to 
scream in 73 countries around the 
world in 16 languages.

UCSD coach joins AIAfQL./ive-weeh tour 
By JEFF SAVAGE 

L yle Yates must have some special key. One year after the Chinese government closed its doors to 
American athletes, as a result of the 
defection of a Chinese tennis star, Yates 
has reopened it and is entering the 
mainland once again. The UCSD 
baseball coac h arrived yesterday, in 
Okinawa. Japan, for the first stop on a 
three-leg tour through the Orient. 
Athletes in Action, a globerrotting 
religious group, recruited Yates two 
weeks ago, before embarking on a five-
week journey which includes StopS in 
Japan, the Philippines and China. 
Athletes in Action is only the second 
American team to ever enter China. The 
first was UCSD. 

In December of 1982, Yates and his 
UCSD baseball team spent twO weeks in 
mainland China, enjoying the rich 
culture and tradition, and playing 
various teams throughout the country. 

Athletes in Action helps to spread the 
gospel through athletics, in Yates' words, 
"by being very friendly and concerned 
and willing to teach ." According to 
Yates, the mission is two-fold. "It is 
baSically a good will trip , but we will be 
holding lectures and clinics to train 
their people." 

AlA will be in Okinawa until May 30, 
and will play the Japanese national team 
and various local Japanese teams. From 
there , AlA will travel to the Philippines 
where they will arrive in Manila and 
remain for ten days, holding 
instructional clinics and playing the 
Filipino national team. 

AlA will then travel to China where 
they will spend the next 17 days in 
Beijing and Shanghai taking on the local 
Chinese teams and meeting the Chinese 
national team in a five-game series. 

Yates was recommended for AlA by 

the San Diego Pro Sports Ministries, and 
while reviewing him for consideration, 
they discovered that he had been 
through China before. "That was the real 
clincher," said the UCSD third-year 
coach. "I'm not sure I would be going if 
not for the experience I've received." 

After being actepted, Yates was faced 
with another hurdle - a summer 
baseball camp to be conducted for the 
first time at UCSD with Yates in charge. 
The two week camp begins July 8, one 
week after Yates return 10 San Diego, but 
because the program is just in its 
infancy and must be developed, a great 
deal of organization and preparation is 
required. And because the UCSD 
baseball team concluded its season only 
last week, Yates was afforded little time 
to carry out his duties. 

"I told Judy I UCSD athletic director 
Judy Sweetl about the opponuniry and 
jUst waited for her approval," Yates said. 
"For a while there, I was afraid she 
wasn't going to allow me to go." 

"He had obligations 10 recruiting and 
summer sports camps," said Sweet. "But 
he convinced me that other people 
would take care of them while he was 
gone." 

After Sweet granted approval, Yates 
did some scrambling to organize a 
comrol structure for the instructional 
camp. A staff of five will assume the 
duties that Yates would have carried out, 
and UCSD third base coach Charlie 
Cox will head the operation . Yates is 
paying Cox with his apartment, by 
allowing Cox to live in it through June. 

When Yates returns on June 30, he 
will assume control of the camp. 

"This is just a fantastic opponunity, 
and I'm JUSt so excited," said Yates, just 
before leaving for the airport. "Right 
now I can hardly believe I'm going."

Olympics 
The spirit of the Olympic Games, 

now overshadowed by political tension 
among nations, would be resurrected if 
the games were permanently returned 10 
their birthplace - Olympia, Greece, 
Senator Nicholas Petris CD-Oakland) 
said at a press conference Tuesday. 

At the invitation of the Greek 
government, Petris has introduced a 
resolution urging the International and 
US OlympiC Committees 10 establish a 
permanent neutral summer Olympic site 
in Olympia , Greece, where the games 
originated 2,500 years ago. 

"Such a m0Ve would help to 
neutralize the Games and make them 
less susceptible 10 political pressures 
and international political rivalry, and is 
more likely 10 revive the original 
Olympic spirit of peace and harmony 
among nations," states the resolution. 

Addressing the currem political 
tensions surrounding the Olympics, 
Petris said returning the games 
permanently to their origin would not 
only "de-politicize" them but save 
money. too. 

Besides de-politicizing the Games, 
and ending the threat of boycotts, 
establishing a permanent base will be a 
huge money saver. Different cities won't 
have to spend millions or billions for 
facilities which will only be used for the 
OlympiCS once and put them into hock. 
Perhaps returning the OlympiCS to 
Olympia will help de-commercialize 
them as well as take the politiCS out," 
Petris said. 

The resolution is expected to receive 
more artention from both the federal 
government and the IOC than a similar 
one passed by the state legislature in 
1980, because of the present political 
situation surroundin~ this year's 
Olympics, Petris saia. The Soviet Union 
has announced its decision to boycott 
the Los Angeles Games, while talk of 

Sportswriters 

separate Olympics for Eastern Bloc 
countries continues. 

The 1980 resolution was discussed by 
the IOC, but it was neither rejected nor 
accepted , Greek Consul General in San 
Francisco, Christos Botsios, said . 

After the 1980 resolution , presemed 
to the Greek government by state 
legislalOrs from both houses, Greek 
President Constantine Karamanlis 
proposed that a large area of land be 
dedicated to the OlympiC Games 
beginning in 1992. All nations would be 
allowed 10 construct their own facilities 
on the site and practice there prior to 
the Games, Botsios said. 

Karamanlis' proposal to the committee 
includes making all arrangements and 
accommodations for athletes, journalists 
and tourists , accordng to the resolution. 
In addition , it states, the Greek OlympiC 
Committee will develop both a neutral 
airport and seaport. 

Botsios is confident that Greece will 
be able 10 protect all I]ations' athletes 
from the pOSSibility of political violence 
occurring at the Gam(s. 

"Greece, compared to other European 
states, is pretty safe," he_ said. 

"The Olympic Spirit dates back more 
than 2,500 years. We don't want it to 
die in our lifetimes," he said. 

The Olympic Games originated in 
Olympia, Greece in 776 BC. Ongoing 
wars were interrupted for the sacred 
Games, allowing warrior athletes to 
participate . The purpose of the Games 
was to promote peace among Greek and 
Roman city-states. 

Petris expects the resolution will 
receive wide support from members in 
both houses , as did the 1980 resolution. 
The last measure was co-authored by 
over 100 legislators, he said.

b.b.q., the food. the drink. the coconuts. the leis, the girls, the boys, the 
fr1sbees ... ahl The 1Jisbees. that should be the clue. That's right, this was 
no luau; it was I.M. Ultimate Disc play-01fs. Someone just forgot to tell the 
guys and gals ot Your Cleat or Us just how important this game was. 
Eventually, they figured 1t out and managed to edge out underdogs 
Rotating Penetrators by a score ot 9-8. Led more or less (mostly less) by 
Darren Bedell Eric Bonzell and Krls Trattner, Your Cleat or Us 
adVances to the AA semi-t1ncUs. Good luck and keep those nice shirts 
clean.

Bob's Book Report 

Goddard's 'BaJeftre' is 
a Uterary smorgasbord 

1ya.a.~ortE 
lJIle/frt. by Kenneth Goddard. Is a well-wrltten book that canÂ·t 

decide what It wants to be. Political thriller, Robert Ludlum style 
suspense or police procedural, all come forward and meet and mil 
In this book, not to any III ttrect. but not to any extrlordlnarOy 
good drect dtller. 

The plot Is rather simple. A telTOl'lst Is sent to commit an act of 
terrorism. or rather a campaign of terror, for the beneftt of the 1984 
SUmmer Olympics. Instead of heading for Los Angeles. and all the 
security forces rounded up there specially to prevent acts of terror. 
the terrorist. Yclept Thanatos, Is cUspatched to a nearby city to 
create an act visible from IA and more speclftcally the Memorial 
Stadium, at the precise moment the Olympic Torch Is lit. 

Of course, the terrorist takes the time to start a series of 
diversions begtMlng nine days bdbre the torch Is lit. just so that 
when the police Onally recover, they will be able to ftgure out that 
they and their commnlty were trounced by a single professional, 
and that AmerIca can never consider Itself safe from International 
terror again. 

Of course, Thanatos cannot help but leave traces. and the police 
omcers ftnally, knowing what hit them, begin to do more thanjust 
blindly react. rrom there. It becomes the stereotyped race against 
time by both sides. 

The actual writing of this book Is a bit more than adequate, 
despite Goddard's obvious debt to the Don Pendleton school of 
writing. riot only does Goddard know fairly well what to do with 
acUectives and verbs, but he does It. However, characterization 
rarely rises above stereotyping and hac:kne)U phrues. 

this Is because &l~re Is Intended as a cautionary tale. It warns 
against apathy, isolationism and the potential of terrorism. 
Continually. It harps on the same themes. resembling a sermon at 
times. 

It Is also heavily detailed, perhaps a result of Goddard's more 
than a decade of experience as a forensic scientist In law 
enforcernenl

The newest addition to art at UCSD 
Isolated rocks and tables has 
appeared. 

It could just as easily have 
been wooden beam. Iron pillars 
or straw bales. or even the 
ground Itself. Granite wasn't 
necessary, It just happened to be 
the lucky material. The 
fascinating thing about all these 
rocks strewn about Is that they 
are sharp. crisp. ' well-cut 
Igneous formations. not 
pseudo-ruins that one tan stili 
find ending paths and trails In 
gardens planned on Romantic 
or Victorian models, There Is no 
pretense (except perhaps some 
pretentiousness endemic to 
universities with growing 
sculpture collections) that this 
Is something It Isn't. It's just~ a 
set of structural granite (I'm 
stili trying to figure out why 
California stone wasn't used) 
rocks set out to set minds 
thinking about the significance 
of their arrangement.

"What hath the Stuart 

Collection wrought this time?" 
asked one of this school's more 
c1aS5lcally' minded gentleman 
when he ftrst observed the

That happens to be about the 
strongest comment 50 far by an 
Individual student. 

riot all seem to use such 
archaic language, but the 
common reaction seems to be 
"Oh, a new one." or, "Oh, yeah. I 
saw that" or. "I don't really like 
It," or, "It's OK. I guess." Unlike

could outshIne the work of 
"Clean Head." who leisurtly 
strolled on stage to play his 
solos with the ultimate In jau 
feeling. 

colorful element was set' In 
place all In one day. It's hard for 
many to conceive of this latest 
creation. titled" La Jolla Prqject 
1983-1984," as something 
really new. After all. they (the 
artist and his rlew ~gland crew 
of stonemasons and other 
experts) started putting up the 
Individual stones (together 
massing more than 100 tons of 
rlew Hampshire granite) during 
winter quarter's Hnals week. 
We've had the entire construct 
(except for some reseeding and 
the scraping out of a patch of 
turf for no really obvious reason 
except to scratch out a patch of 

turf and reseed It and put up 
some "Keep Off the Grass" 
signs) staring at us for about a 
quarter, 

The violent reactions, If there 
ever were any, have all 
mellowed out (remember how 
after the Sun God was up for 
about three weeks the chem. 
IDiijors stopped trying to figure 
out the heat of combustion for 
that much fiberglass and 
polyester) with the passage of 
time, and even though the 
granite does seem to either 
stain or collect mold (especially 
the altar), It will look nice for 
the graduation ceremonies. 

RIchard rlelschner, If his 
previous works are any standard 
of judgment. Is obsessed with 
location. Outside looking In. 
Inside looking out. In transition 
one side to the other. looking 
through windows, Sitting In a 
box. All these fascinate him (or 
they wouldn't have been a 
prominent part of his work). The 
" La Jolla Project" Is no 
exception. On a site defined on 
one side by the library. on two 
more sides by parking lots and 
eucalyptus groves, and on 
another side by a steep drop, a 
bewildering assortment of 
portals and windows and 

However. such plainness 
cannot divert wonder. for 
example, there Is the title ofthe 
piece, "La Jolla Prqject 1983-
1984." Who died? Are we gazing 
on the tough vertebrae or 
ventral plates of some unlikely 
dinosaur or amphibian 
resurrected or created In the 
musty corridors of the Biology 
Building or the Marine 
Physiology Laboratory down at 
Scripps? Or Is It something a 
visiting professor brought with 
him that escaped into the Muir 
Cafe one day and ate too many 
students?

'Attractions' and some UCSD 
undergrads take the stage 

By JOM rORSB[RG 
The "Halloween Murderer" 

arrives at UCSD this weekend. 
No. this Is not the latest low-
budget fright-flick destined for 
the horror Him hall of shame. 
The " Halloween Murderer"ls the 
personage created by 
Pla)Wl'ight Ted Talley In his 
black comedy Coming 
Attractions. currently being 
produced by the Drama 
Department at the UCSD Theatre 
at Warren College. 

Directed by graduate student 
Chris Matheson . Coming 
Attractions is Talley ' s 
humorously cynical examina-
tion of the power of the mass 
media and its practice of 
capitalizing on violent crimes, 
Talley emphasizes the irony of 
individuals 'in our society who. 
while vehemently advocating 
stricter penalties for convicted 
criminals. at the same time 
think little of the " marketing" 
of real crimes with real victims 
in newspapers. magazines. 
books and film by the media and 
the entertainment industry. 

first performed in 1980 at 
New York 's Playwrights 
Horizons. Coming Attractions 
Is the story of lonnie. an 
Ineffectual, smail-time 
criminal . who is discovered by 
Manny. a shady press agent 
anxious to make an easy buck. 
Acknowledging the crude 
reality of the media 's 

exploitation of "celebrities" in 
American society. Manny 
exclaims. "It ain't news 'til some 
jerk of a writer invents it. ... Ya 
need that extra touch of mystery 
so the newshounds got 
somethin' to chew on .... " 

Recognizing vast HnancJaI 
opportunity. Manny turns 
lonnie into the " Halloween 
Murderer ." a superstar 
scoundrel who becomes the 
featured celebrity in 
newspapers and on talk shows 
and variety shows. lonnie even 
marries Miss America before his 
glory is inevitably consumed by 
his fate, 

for this hilarious play 
addressing a serious issue. 
director Matheson is striving for 
a production that " makes the 
audience fall out of their seats 
laughing and at the same time. 
leaves them absolutely 
horrified," 

Coming Attractions contin-
ues nightly at 8 pm through this 
Saturday.

King's novel goes up in Dames on tbe screen 
By trHArt r[[RST 

Drew IIanymore as a aeet eIgIlt-year-old â¢â¢â¢ 

Its acronym Is DSI. short for 
the Department of Scientific 
Intelligence, or the "Shop." In 
firestarter. the latest page-to-
screen adaptation of a Stephen 
King novel. the "Shop" Is in 
pursuit of a product of one of Its 
covert experiments designed to 
fortify the United States' 
wartime abilities. That product 
Is Charlie McGee (Drew 
8arrymore). an elght-year~ld 
pyroklnetlc whose parents were 
previously part of a DSI 
experiment that left them 
endowed with para psychic 
abilities. And as their daughter 
has grown. so have her powers. 

Charlie's father (David Keith) 
has trained her well. teaching 
the igniting girl control and 
restraint by having her toast 
pieces of bread. But as much as 
little Charlie doesn't want to 
hurt anybody. self defense has 
forced her not to get burned by 
the exploitative intentions of 
captain Hollister (Martin Sheen) 
and John Ralnblrd (George C. 
Scott) of the " ShOp," 

Unfortunately. the intelli-

gence of previous King 
adaptations (David Cronen-
berg's Dead Zone and John 
Carpenter's Christine) is 
somehow lost in this Mark 
Lester effort. The story unfolds 
flawlessly at first. clearly 
deHning the intensity of the 
relationship between the 
firestarter and her father. their 
past and the potential little 
Charlie's powers might reach. 

But after Charlie and her 
father are finally hunted down 
and captured. letting no time be 
wasted to flaunt the girl's 
flaming powers (care of glorious 
special effects). the rest of the 
film relies on a simple timing 
mechanism, 

The Hnal showdown itself 
becomes a gross and mindless 
display of Hollywood's ability to 
convince us that an eight-year-
old girl can start fires. vaporize 
bullets and send masses of 
fireballs towards her assailants, 
Perhaps Drew Barrymore is just 
too cute to believe - even (or 
especially) wh.en she's acting 
like a giant Bic lighter. â¢â¢ .and a glaat Bk Ugbter In 'l'Iratarter:

In the past decade, the level 
of artistry Involved In being a OJ 
has risen far beyond the concept 
of developing segues between 
songs that Just "sound good:' 
Now, a good OJ Is marked by his 
(or her) ability to manipulate 
pre-recorded pieces Into their 
own works of creativity. Such Is 
the case with Joseph Saddler, 
better known as Grandmaster 
flash. 

Associated with a OJ are 
rappers who sing! speak over the 

O"'''ii'.'''''_ montage of rhythms created by 
the OJ. This relationship 
between a OJ and his rappers 15 
much akin to that of a 
conductor and his orchestra. 

Grandmaster flash was the 
prime Innonvator In this new 
musical art form which has 
spawned a new genre that has 
grown Into Its own culture. This 
sound has also found Its way 
Into other more conventional 
forms d music. Perhaps the 
most obvious of these is Herbie 
Hancock's use of "scratching" 
on his album futureshock. 

With the rise In popularity of 
flash's music on the New York 
club scene, there came also a 
good deal of attention from 

........ ~~ Sugarhlll Records, which 

subsequently released several 
singles from the ensemble. 
Despite this achievement, the 
group found that Its 
management and the record 
company were not adequately 
fulnlllng their duties, and began
