Violence Victims Take Back the Night 
Poetry performance and testimonials mark emotional event 
By MARGARET O'NEIU 
Staff Writer 

Over 200 women and men gathered in the 
Price Center Plaza Thursday night for the 2001 
Take Back the Night Rally. The rally, sponsored 
by the A.S. Women's Commission and the 
Women's Center, was followed by a candlelit 
march around campus. 

The night began with a performance by 
singer Tara MacClean. Her performance 
included an a cappella version of her song 
"Silence." 

Speaker Steve Allen from the Men's 
Leadership Forum and the Center for 
Community Solutions took the stage next. He 
discussed men's roles in assault prevention and 
mentioned that he was the first male speaker at 
a Take Back the Night rally at UCSD. 

Poet Kim Cook was the keynote speaker for 

the evening. She opened her speech by reading 
a few of her poems on different topics, includ-
ing family, assault and recovery. 

Cook went on to discuss the hardship she 
has encountered in her life and how she has 
overcome it. She rallied women about their 
roles in society and told the audience that 
women should not have to be afraid of the 
night. 

· We're women! " she said. "I want to be sexy 
and cute and all that shit, and yeah, we're 
gonna take back the night!" 

Cook closed her talk with a reading of a 
poem she wrote for the occasion, titled "Take 
Back the Night." 

"I beg you, brothers and sisters, wake up to 
the moment of knowing," she said. 

She read the poem twice, once slowly for the

Muirstock Attracts Record Numbers to the· ·Muir Quad 
Common Sense he~d l ines Muir college music event held on unofficial marijuana holiday 
By STEVE LEHTONEN 
Staff Writer 

Muirstock, a campus festival of 
music, food and vendors, invaded 
the Muir quad on Friday after-
noon and received mixed reviews 
from studen ts. 

Although most students 
enjoyed the music and overall 
event, some were concerned with 
the April 20 event's apparent rela-
tionship to "420: a date often cel-
ebrated by marijuana users. 

Nonetheless, hundreds of stu-
dents came to what some called 
the largest crowd ever to fill the 
Muir quad. 

Tho stages, set up in front of 
Tenaya and Tioga halls, featured 
seven bands: N-Z Rough, Straight 
No Chaser, Munkafust, Thrice, 
Taken, 34 Below and headliner 

Common Sense. 
Prior to the show, Muir 

sophomore Missy Tierney 
expressed her sentiments about 
the show: "I'm excited to see 
Common Sense." 

The band did not disappoint. 
"All the guys from Common 

Sense were really cool ," said 
Muir freshman Gabe Grossman. 
"They were out afterward clean-
ing up and they still stopped to 
talk to their fans. They signed my 
hat." 

Other bands also thrilled the 
crowd. 

"Thrice was awesome: said 
Muir sophomore Tomas 
Bogardus. 

Muir sophomore Nick 
Lieberknecht enjoyed 34 Below 
and supported the band's inel u-
sion at the upcoming Sun God 

festival on May 18. 
"34 Below is the kind of class 

act that we would love to sce at 
Sun God: Lieberknech t said. 

Despite the bands and free bar-
becue sponsored by Muir College 
Council, some students found the 
connection to "420" offensive. 

The concert , although run-
ning late, was scheduled to start 
at 4:20 p.m. with reggae band N-
Z Rough. Muir freshm an josh 
Gray was among those who 
found the "420' implications 
hypocritical. 

"[ thought it was a pathetic 
attempt on the school's part to 
accommodate the stoner crowd: 
Gray said. "They are supposed to 
be throwing a concert on that day, 
but they kick people out for 
smoking pot in the dorms." 

Gray was expelled from his 

fifth-floor room at Tcnaya 11 ,111 for 
smoking marijuana earlier tillS 
academic year. 

Sophomore Ada111 Swenson 
also viewed the perceived support 
as a double standard. 

"I think it 's stupid that they 
give us rulcs to make our lives bet-
tcr and then encourage breaking 
their own rules to make our lives 
better," he said . 

Yet th e coordinato rs of 
Muirstock defended the "420" 
implications as both coincidenta l 
and a mere publicity gimmick. 

Typically, Muir college plans a 
john Muir Week to coincide with 
the environmentalist's birthday on 
April 21.

New art exhibits aim more at shock than at artistic va lue 
with some on the edge of child pornography I 
By ANDREW BLACKMORE 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

There are some things that are just not 
~rt. ~ece~tly, there have been quite a few 
art exhibits that seem to fit this catego-

ry. An aborted fetus in a jar, various 
decomposing animals in lacquer finish 
and .blatant child pornography are just a 
few Items that have stirred up controversy 
tn the media in the last few months. More 
and more, the concept of what actually 
constitutes art has been 
twisted and stretched to 

guardia!lS, w~o shamelessly display inno-
cent children s bodies in the name of art. 

The intention of Goldin was to create 
a documentary of her family over the 
course of a few years, capturing the inno-
cence and beauty of her children on film. 
This is ~erfectly acceptable, leaving a 
mother with a timeless keepsake. What is 
not perfectly acceptable, however is 
putting this personal collection on dis-
play for the world to see. 

Artists like Goldin should make their 
decisions as parents 

include works such as 
these. This bastardiza-
tioll of the spirit of art 
must be stopped. 
The most recent COlltro-
versial exhibit is "I am a 
Camera," which was on 
display at the Saatchi 
Gallery in London until 

con 
first, artists second. It is 
incomprehensible that a 
parent II' uld willingly 
expose her child in such 
a way Iel1 ing the door 
open for many prob-
lems, emotional or oth-
erwise, that could arise 
later in tnc child's life.

~ast wee~. It contains photos that may be 
tn viola lion of the Protection of Children 
Act for depicting children in questionable 
amounts of attire. 

In other words, the exhibit is under 
scrutiny for being child porno~aphy. 

Taken by Nan Goldin and Timothy 
Gearo~, the phot?s contain nude pictures 
~f thel~ own . chddren. Obviously, these 
artists feel It IS fight to place the bodies of 

their children on display for the world to 
see. These childreh, however, have no 
choice in the matter. If current trends con-
tinue, the children's photographic fates will 
bl: left to the discrelion of their loving 

Art is meant to inspire 
some form of emotion in the viewer, not a 

~urge in ~he libido of some pedophile. Even 
~f the artist has sound intentions, perversity 
IS 111 the mind of the observer and will 
always be present. 

In the WOr?S o~ St. Paul , "Nothing is 
unclean of Itself, but to him that 
~steemeth any thins to be unclean, to him 
It IS uncl.ean." It IS true that the pho-
tographs tn the .Saatchi display were not 
meant to ~e erotic, but to the right person, 
they may tnspl~e perverse sexual feelings.

Why 
Female 
Friends 
Suck 

Jaded & 
Faded 

CAROLINE SONG 

H oW many of you girls oul there have more male friends than female 
friends? How many of 

you girls would absolutely die if you 
weren't surrounded by your gaggle 
of girlfriends? 

Well, go ahead. The world 
would be better off with fewer of 
you, anyway. 

Most of my friends are guys. 
This is no accident. After years of 
makiflg ' painful discoveries, I've 
come to the conclusion that girls 
are bitches. Not all of you, but a 
very large percentage. 

If you arc female, you are now 
reacting in one of three ways: 1. 
You agree with me. 2. You don't 
necessarily agree with me, but 
you're interested in what evidence 
I have to back up my claim. 3. You 
are puffing in indignation . To all 
you umber Threes, I dare you to 
look into the mirror I will now 
hold to your face. 

How many times have you bad-. 
momhed a friend to other people, 
only to receive her in your open 
arms the next time you bump into 
each other? This is the paramount 
difference between male and 
female friends. 

A guy will never bad-mouth 
someone and then pretend to be 
his friend, unless he is under the 
influence of a gi rl. Men are simply 
unwilling to exert the effolt neces-
sary to be two-faced. Besides, they 
do not see a point in pretending to 
be friends with someone they 
don't like. ' 

If a guy meets someone he 
doesn 't like, he doesn't become 
friends with that person. 0 hard 
feelings - unless, of course, the 
person he doesn 't like and refus-
es to be friends with is a girl, who 
will often take it as a personal 
insult whenever someone doesn't 
want to be her friend, because 
everyone should want to be her 
friend, whether they like h~r or 
not. Why does this girl have such 
an illogical line of reasoning? 
Because she's "friends" with 
everyone, whether or not she 
likes them . Right, Number 
Threes? 

The next step (if you are a 
Number Three) is to deny that you 
talk smack about your friends. You 
say you only "discuss" your 
friends' personal lives out of con-
cern for them. 

Such "discussions" often fall 
along these lines: 

"Did you see what she was 
wearing today? Oh my God, her 
boobs were totally hanging out of 
her top! Have you noticed that 
they look bigger? I hope she did-
n't get them done just to please 
that nasty-ass guy she's been 
going out with . I don't think he's 
good for her - look at all the 
weight she's gained ever since 
they started going out. And some-
one should tell her that her hair 
color looks totally fake. Poor girl, 
she probably doesn't even realize 
how skanky she looks with all 
that makeup." 

But why should umber 
Threes concern themselves with 
the size or authenticity of her 
friend's various body parts, or 
what she wears, or how she 
chooses to wear her hair and

Campus Life Can Be Resurrected With Vote 
The fee referendum coming up for vote will determine the future of UCSD 
By DOC KHALEGHI 
Special to the Guardian 

This week the most important 
election in UCSD's history will 
take place. You have seen the signs 
reading "Vote for the Campus Life 
Fee Referendum." But what is this 
referendum, and how can five 
minutes of your time change the 
future of UCSD? 

Our campus is at a crossroads, 
and the direction we choos~ will 
determine the fate of UCSD. Sev-
eral years ago, 87 percent of voting 
students approved a move to Divi-
sion II athletics. Never had such a 
high percentage of students voted 
in favor of anything. 

But with that move came 
increased costs in travel, staff and 
equipment. Athletics needs more 
money to just maintain its pro-
gram . Without any increased 
funding from a new source, not 
only would some tearns have to 
be cut, but the committee that 
funds athletics, the Registration 
Fee Committee, would also have 
to cut funding to many of the 
other units it funds. These pro-
grams include Student ' Health, 
Career Services, the Cross-Cul-

tural Center, and O.A.S.l.S. 
Also, this campus is becoming 

too crowded. The lines at the Price 
Center are too long. There are not 
enough meeting rooms, sllldent 
organization office spaces nor din-
ing seating, and there is not near-
ly enough money to fund the 
hundreds of active groups at 
UCSD. Soon we will have 10,000 
more sllldents occupying the 
same space and sharing a propor-
tionate amount of funds. The 
state, which funds the UC system, 
does not fund any of these ser-
vices because they are considered 
"nonacademic." 

At the beginning of fall quar-
ter, 20 student leaders from stu-
dent government, student orga-
nizations, athletics, cultural 
groups and student co-opera-
tives convened. The committee's 
task was to give students the 
chance to come up with a solu-
tion to the problem while also 
trying to improve many aspects 
of campus life. 

After two quarters and hun-
dreds of hours, students formed 
the Campus Life Fee Referendum, 
which, if passed by the student 
body, will not only prevent the 

occurence of some of these stark 
predictions for the fUlllre , but als 
change the ambiance of UCSD for 
the better. 

The Campus Life FCl' Rcfen'n -
dum will expand the Price Center 
and Student Center, which will 
mean a greater variety of dining 
choices. It· will mean shorter lincs, 
more meeting rooms and dining 
seating, including indoor seating 
at The Grove Caffe, and more 
offices for sllldent organizations. 
There will be new study lounges, 
one being a huge 24-hour lounge 
with 60 computer workstations, 
study rooms, a latc-night restau-
rant and a kitchen . 

But that is only one aspcct of 
this referendum. Money will bc 
provided for athletics so it can 
maintain its programs at thc 
Division II level and not have to 
cut teams, Student organizations 
will be able to install the many 
programs that they have previ-
ously never been able to find 
money for. In addition, the col-
leges will be able to provide more 
events. 

The referendum will allow for 
more cultural and diverse pr -
gramming by providing supp rt

Editor: 
While many of the services 

mentioned in the fee referendum 
would be great, the refercndum is 
the wrong way to bring those ser-
vices about. 

The univcrsity and othcr corpo-
rations (for example, fast food 
chams) stand to make substantial 
profits from the cxpansions sug-
gl'stcd . What is going to happen 
with those profits? Since we havc 
paid in full for the construction of 
the pl,ICC, shouldn 't the university's 
profits (dnd perccntages of the 
~lOrc~ ' profits) go toward reducing 
the stllLknt fees once construction 
IS coillplctcd? :'\ot only alll I dlsap-
p\)lIllcd wllh the content of the rd-

erenduill. but I am incensed by the 
costly and deceptive way it is being 
promoted by the University Cen-
ters Advisory Board. 

For example, what a glorious 
coincidence that two weeks before 
thc vote, the University Center.; 
Marketing Department released the 
very first issue of its eight-page 
"newsletter," Ct'1ltcrpiece. In fact, Ctm-
tcrpicce is nothing more than a thinly 
veiled advertisement promoting the 
fcc hike. The only reason Cmtcrpiece 
was not marked "advertisement" in 
bold letters is because it was decep-
tively marketed as an informative 
newsletter for students. 

Perhaps worse than mislabeled 
propaganda, there are people who 
are actively suppressing the views of 
thc opposition. Last Monday night, 
walking through the Price Center, I 
saw at least 20 signs posted bringing 
up reasons to vote "No" on the fee 
hike. The next morning, walking to 
class, I noticed that the signs had all 
been removed, but about the same 
number of "Vote Yes" signs had 
mysteriously appeared in their place! 

Because UCAB is so desperately 
trying to manufacture student con-
sent by controlling access to infor-
mation about the referendum, we 
students should be extremely suspi-
cious of this fee. We should not only 
be suspicious, uut insulted because 
the University of California is blithe-
ly ignoring the fact that for the past 
two years, similar referendums failed 
to pass in campuswide elections! 

Many similar issues are raised at 
http://wwwfreeucsd.org. Vote "No" 
on the administration 's unwarrant-
ed fee hike.

more like child porn

dren and the gallery. Anything 
can be taken the wrong way; it is 
in the best interests of all parties 
involved to simply end the prob-
lem before it starts. 

The art world is a tough one to 
make a living in . Competition is a 
major factor, and often the only 
way to receive acclaim is to create 
something more shocking or con-
troversial than others. The high 
ratings of "reality" television pro-
grams prove that what people 
want to see is the exciting, the 
painful or the obscene, even if it is 
at the expense of the 
innocent. Entertainment has 
taken precedence over the protec-
tion of the individual - a bleak 
indicator of the moral state of 
affairs in the world . This applies in 
the art world as well as the en ter-
tainment industry. 

Displays of unborn fetuses and 
lifeless, skinless animals are per-
fect examples of art that relies on

makeup? Chances are, Number 
Three wouldn't talk this way 
about a friend if that friend were 
really that unattractive. If the 
friend was really that ugly, then 
everyone would know it , and 

umber Threes wouldn't have 
to convince anyone - least of all 
themselves. Do I detect a bit of 
competi tion or jealousy, um-
ber Threes? 

Granted, guys are very com-

shock value rather than artistic 
merit for acceptance. Child 
pornography is much the same. 
While Nan's artistic goals could 
be easily accomplished without 
any graphic content, the element 
of controversy is what really 
advances the fame and value of 
the work. 

Goldin mayor may not have 
had this on her mind during the 
photo shoots, but the media 
exposure that her exhibit 
received most certainly brought 
more fame than the work 
alone. Degradation of art such as 
this must be curbed before the 
art world merges with Holly-
wood to become one big joke. 

petitive as well, and this often 
leads to jealousy, but at least 
guys are much more up-front 
about it. 

They don't play an elaborate 
game of trying to sabotage a 
friend's reputation, all in the 
guise of friendly concern. Plus, 
since most of my friends are of 
the opposite sex, they have very 
little to envy me for, unless 'one 
of them is gay and happens to 
like my boyfriend (this scenario 
has yet to take place) . 

So what happened to me to 
make me so wary of women? [t

Monday, April 23, 2001 

Art should not be engineered to 
be simply what people want to 
see. People should want to see it 
simply because it is art. 

In order to stop the need for 
controversy in the art world, 
precedents need to be set that 
differentiate between what is art 
and what is simply obscene. A 
columnist in the "Economist" 
writing on this same issue com-
mented that "art is art to the 
extent that it is 
interesting." However, every type 

of art has its place. 
Some, like the exhibit involv-

ing the fetus, should be 
denounced as a poor attempt to 
win fame in a tough world . Oth-
ers, like Goldin's co ll ection, 
should be kept in their own 
place, out of the public eye. Art is 
in the mind of the artist. so it's 
not fair to say that anyone thing 
has less artistic value than the 
next. "I am a Camera" is proba-
bly a brilliant piece in its own 
right, but it infringes on the 
rights of innocent 
children. Works such as this, 
profound as they may be, should 
not be recognized as legitimate, 
for-public-consumption art. 

Three. Actually, most of my 
female friends in high school 
turned out to be Number Threes. 
As a result, I have fewer female 
friends in college, but the ones I 
do have are real. 

[ realize the futility of my 
attempt to get through to all you 
Number Threes out there. [f 
you're a two-faced bitch who's 
jealous of all your other friends, 
then you 're not going to listen to 
some other bitch tell you so in her 
stupid newspaper column. So be 
it. But perhaps all the non- um-
ber Threes will start to see you as 
you really are. 

Or perhaps I just wanted to tell 
you you're a bitch .

directed against a lot of pictures and movies 
because they encourage pedophilia. When 
was the last time you heard of a law that 
banned stuff entirely - not just restricted 
access - because it encouraged anything? 
That's right, you probably haven't because of 
silly little restrictions like the First Amend-
ment. For example, I personally believe that 
the new state quarters encourage underage 
drinking, but every time I write to my con-
gressman, he always gets back to me with 
this First Amendment crap. 

What I find particularly disturbing is that 
I've read reports of right-wing activists 
storming into various Barnes & Noble and 
ripping pages out of Jock Sturge;' photogra-
phy books, which include (in my opinion) 
tasteful photographs of underage models. 
There's really nothing sexual about any of It 
- I suggest a trip down to the bookstore to 
judge for yourself. 

If we're allowed to rip pages out of books, 
why stop at photographs? To be really effi-
cient, we should just have a big bonfire in the 
middle of Barnes & Noble and burn every-
thing anybody ever found offensive. Then all 
you'd have left on the shelves are a few select 
Dr. Seuss books, "Watership Down; and the 
script to "Shawshank Redemption; because 
hey, everybody likes "Shawshank Redemp-
tion."

After a spate of deadly bomb-
ings in March, April has bern a 
month of mortar attacks that have 
caused few casualties but have 
provoked a strong Israt:li military 

response, 
Arafat ordered the mortar 

attacks to end, and they had 
tapered off by the time Israe li and 
Palestinian officia ls met on 
Saturday night on the border 
between Israel and Gaza, 

The Israelis announced early 
Sunday that the three-hour meet-
ing, which was mediated by U,S, 
officials, had been constructive, 

The two sides agreed on "Iong-
tmn and ongoing security coop-
cration," the Israeli annou nce-
ment said, "It was decided to 
implement a number of steps for 
bringing about a cessation of the 
continuous violence and terror, 
and a continuation of the easing 
up of civil and economic restric-
tions for the Palestinians," 

Palestinian officials sounded 
less impressed with the results, 
sayi ng they would wait to see 
whether the Israelis lifted restric-
tions as promised,

And so, Nader, 67, says, his

year's election arc regrets that he 
did not get more votes, Hc says he 
does not bdieve that he helped in 
the defea t of Vice Presidcll! AI

contest in Florida: "He beat him-

contends, nearly 100 days illto the

Despite the Army's advocacy, 
the ad\'isoly panel concluded that 
the Crusader was ill suited for a 
new military strategy focused on 
projecting military power over 
long distances with ai r and naval 
forces, 

The panel also recommended 
scuttling plans to modernize other 
Army weapons, including the M 1-
A2 Abrams tank and the Bradley 
armored combat veh icle, as well as 
the Air Force's B-1 bomber, 

And it proposed not moving 
ahead with the Navy's new 
destroyer, the 00-21, contending 
that the des troyer, like the 
Crusader, did not represent a 
technological leap forward but 
simply a modest improvement on 
today's so-called legacy force, . 

Pentagon and administration 
officials emphasized that no final 
decisions had been made on any 
programs, including the Crusader,

Does Nader worry about being 
a spoiler in a close battle for the 
House? 

"Anybody who's trying to build 
a parry tries to build the parry." he 
says, "You don 't worry about how 
it affects one or the other major 
parties," 

Deb Callahan, president of the 
League of Conservation Voters, 
does not agree, 

"He doesn 't seem to have 
changed hi~ mind one iota about 
the strategy he pursued in 2000 -
and that strategy has led to real 
devastation for environmental 
policy," she said, "It's preposter-
ous that the fact that we have a

States Creating Own 
Plans to Cut Drug Costs 

WASHINGTON - States are 
methodically creating and expand-
ing programs to help low-income 
elderly people buy prescription 
drugs, even as Congress appears to 
be floundering in efforts to add 
drug benefits to Medicare, 

Some states, like Pennsylvania, 
use state money to pay part of the 
cost of each prescription. Some, 
like California and Florida, have 
passed laws limiting the prices that 
pharmacics can charge elderly cus-
tomers, A few, like Michigan and 
Missouri, have cre-

Pennsylvania's pharmaceutical 
assistance program was a lifesaver, 
She pays a $6 co-payment for each 
of the five drugs she takes, 

"It would cost me $400 to $450 
a month if I had to pay for these 
prescriptions on my own," Kuntz 
said, "I would not be able 10 buy 
them all." 

Congress has held several hear-
ings on Medicare drug benefi ts th is 
year, but is nowhere near a consen-
sus, Lawmakers disagrec on the 
basic question of whcther to pro-

vide benefits to all 
ated tax credits to 
offset the amounts 
spent on prescri p-
tion drugs, 

Other states, 
including Iowa, 
New Hampshire, 
Washington and 
West Virginia, have 
created buyers' 
clubs or purchas-
ing cooperatives to 
help low-income 

'The state programs 
are very popular for 
good reason. They 
are meeting a real 
need, But in no way 
do they constitute a 
national safety net,' 

Mediearc recipients 
or just those with 
the grcatest finan-
cia l need , Official 
cost es timates for 
all proposals have 
shot up 30 percent 
in the last year, 
confounding con-
gressional efforts to 
set premiums, 
deductibles, co-

elderly people obtain drug dis-
counts, 

Two states, Maine and Vermont, 
have recently receivcd permission 
from the federal government to usc 
their Medicaid programs to provide 
drug discounts to tens of thou-
sands of elderly and low-income 
people who would not other.vise 
qualify for Medicaid , Maryland 
plans a similar program under a bill 
signed on Fri~ay by Gov, Parris I, 
Glendening, 

And various states in th e 
Northeast and the South are band-
ing together to negotiate discounts 
from drug manufacturers, Five 
states in the Northwest are consid-
ering similar joint efforts, 

Margaret H, Kuntz, a 71-year-
old retired bookkeeper who lives 
outside Pittsburgh, said 

China: 
Bao himself was not 
involved in the release 
Continued from page 1 
statement, he refutes the accusa-
tions against him , 

Bao was an adviser and speech-
writer for Zhao Ziyang. the 
Communist Parry chief before the 
crackdown, Bao was held in soli-
tary confinement for seven years 
on charges of leaking state secrets 
and now lives in Beiji ng under 
intense survei ll ance, Zhao has 
been under house arrest since he 
was ousted, before the army shqt 
its way to Tiananmen Square on 
June 4, 1989, killing hundreds and 
leaving an unresolved national 
trauma , 

Bao's statement, which was kept 
in a few secret archives, was recent-
ly smuggled out by an unnamed 
official still in government, who 
wrote in a short introduction that 
he wants " to provide further evi-
dence toward revealing the truth 
aboutJune 4." Bao himself was not 
apparently involved in the release, 
but others verified the authenticiry 
of the document. ' 

The statement appears to cor-
roborate some important details in 
uThe Tiananmen Papers." a collec-
tion of purportedly secret docu-
ments from 1989 that was pub-
lished in the United States last year 
in English and last week in Hong 
Kong in the original Chinese, Many 
Western and Chinese scholars have 

payments and 
other details of drug coverage, 

State officials sa id they were 
taking action for the reasons ci ted 
often by President Bush, members 
of Congress and elderly people: 
Prescription drugs account for a 
growing share of all health care 
spending, "States are responding to 
a vacuum in federal policy, the lack 
of prescrip ti on drug coverage 
under Medica re:' professor 
Stephen Clystal, a gerontologist at 
Rutgers Universiry in New Jersey, 
said, "The statc programs arc very 
popular for good.rcason, They arc 
meeting a real need, But in no way 
do they constitute a national safery 
net, It 's a spotty system that exists 
in some places and not others," 

- Robert Pear 
New York 7/111e:; 

concluded that the doculllcnts are 
largely genui nc, 

Explaining his own actions in 
the weeks before his arrest on May 
28,1989, Bao describes some of the 
same secret meetings of parry lead-
ers that were first mentioned in the 
collection. The documell! also pro-
vides new deta ils of the bitter 
schism between Zhao and Bao on 
one side, who proposed dialogue 
with the students, and Prime 
Minister Li Peng on the other, who 
argued that the movement had to 
be crushed to save the parry, 

The government's seemingly 
frantic response to publication of 
"The Tiananmen Papers" suggests 
a continuing and deep anxiety 
within the parry, 

President Jiang Zcmin and 
other leaders have tried to dismiss 
the collection as largely fabricated, 
At the same time, security agencies 
appear to be searching hard for 
officials or scholars-who may have 
helped the anonymous compiler 
obtain the papers, 

The parry leaders also oversaw 
preparation in December of a fOllr-
and-a-half-hour videotape, "Test of 
History," which upper-level officials 
around the country have been 
required to watch, People who have 
seen it say the video justifies the 
repression in 1989 as necessary to 
fend off chaos provoked by hostile 
Western forces and to permit 
China's subsequent economic 
advancement.

Cook was acknowledged with a

Following Cook's perfor-

testimonials, 

:Twenry women and twO men

stories by expressing that they had 
not expected to step up to the 
microphone, 

First-year cognitive science

was one of those who did not 
expect to share her story, 

The first testimonial was a 
poem prepared for the event by a 
student, then a few of the even t's

"Theil there was thIS bIg 
silence," Jovanovic said, "I thought 
that a regular person should just 
go up and let Ithe audience] know 
that it wasn 't just the organizers 
who had these experiences," 

Jovanovic took this task upon 
herself, 

"I was already shaken by the 
things that had gone on ," she said, 
"I was shaking and on the verge of 
crying, and I went up there com-
pletely unrehearsed, I felt really vul-
nerable and on the spot as I talked." 

In the end, though, she was 
glad she had spoken,

Daylong Holocaust Vigil 
Sponsored by UJS, Hillel 
Volunteers read names of 1,5 million childr n 
who were kilred by th Third Reich in WWII 
By JENNIFER GRADY 
Senior Staff Wnter 

For the thIrd consecutive )'(.11', 
the 'Union of Jewish Studel1ls ,lI1d 
Hillel of UCSD sponsored a vigtI 
for the 1.5 million children who 
lost their lives during the 
Holocaust. 

Volunteers from student and 
cultural organizations read aloud 
victims' names in the Price Center 
from 3 p,m, Wednesday until 3 
p,m, Thursday, 

The Union of jewish Studl'l1ls 
calculated that in order to rCnll:lll-
ber and honor every known 
Holocaust vi tim, it would require 
seven people to read names aloud 
24 hours a day for a week and a 
half, 

The event, which lOok placL' on 
Holocaust Memorial Day, was a 
part of Jewish Awareness Month. 
The date corresponds to Israeli 
Independence Day, which coin-
cides with Yom Ha'Shoah on the 
Hebrew calendar. 

In addition to the vigil, all 11 .5 
million victims of the Holocaust 
were represented at the Hump near 
the Student Center by the usc of 
color-coded flags, each one repre-
senting 8,000 victims of different 
groups and ethnicities. 

Jon Pomerantz, the social action 
chair for UjS, explained the pur-
pose of reading aloud the names of 
Holocaust victims, 

ult 's to educate people so that 
this will not happen again to any 
group." Pomerantz said, "Because 
we are the last generation 10 hear 
Holocaust survivors speak, it is

USSA: 
Regents have historically 
rejected similar referendums 
Continued from page 1 
commissioners would have a 
chance to debate the allocation of 
money. 

In a leuer to Mah moud on this 
issue, Watson stated that the USSA 
referendum question in the elec-
tion booklet was poorly written, 
misleading and not a UC-con-
trolled student activity. 

Mahmoud said he questions the 
validity of these points. 

"His il1lerpretation of the lan-
guage is of no real importance," 
Mahmoud said of Watson. "What 
is important is that ASUCSD 
understands that the sole function 
of the referendum was to increase 
the student activity fees by $2. 
There is no UC policy that allows 
vice chancellors the ability to 
interpret A.S. student activity fee 
increases to provide a fu nction 
they do not." 

UC campuses currently con-
tributc to both UCSA and US SA. 
Increasing the money the organiza-
tions receive does not violate any 
UC policies. 

Regardless, Watson said the 
administration told the A.S. 
Council before the deadline that it 
would not sign the legislation, even 
if It passed. 

"We can't take things off the 
ballo!," he said. "But we made it 
clear that we didn't support the 
issue." 

Mahmoud said that he was not 
notified of the administration's 
stance. 

"I did not know that he would-

n't approve it, and I take offense to 
people suggesting I did," he said. 
"Why would I waste my time initi-
ating something like this if I 
thought it wouldn't even reach the 
chancellor's desk?" 

Over the course of election 
week, 2,646 students voted on the 
issue; 1,478 voted yes and 1,268 
students voted no. 

Although the numbers of stu-
dents who voted in favor of the leg-
islation will change nothing at this 
time, Mahmoud is still encouraging 
other students to lobby to get 
Watson to sign the bill. 

"I think the biggest pressure 
[Watson I can get is from students," 
he said. "I think students need to 
write him letters." 

A.S. Council President Doc 
Khaleghi believes that even if 
Watson does sign it, the bill will 
never be passed by the UC Regents, 
as they have rejected similar bills 
from UC Santa Barbara and 
UCLA. 

"The regents have already set 
the precedent that they won't sign 
these," he said. 

Mahmoud said the regents have 
always been cautious about signing 
legislation such as this. 

"Basica lly, the UC Rege nts 
have had a history of narrowly and 
conservatively interpreting legisla-
tion and court cases regarding 
studen t fee autonomy," he said. 
"Allocations to organizations are 
to be done in a manner that's con-
tent-neutral, and [the UC 
Regentsl don't fee l that referen-
dums are content-neutraL" 

Although the 1993 court case 
of Smith v. Regents established that 
students can use their fees to 
lobby, the UC Regents are against 
giving money to outside groups 

The UCSD Guardian 

such as USSA for this purpose. 
"If we are allowed to lobby, we 

should be able to have access to 
whatever resources and associa-
tions we as students see fit to do the 
job," Mahmoud said. "We students 
should not be limited to face-to-
face lobbying." 

US SA has been the only student 
lobbying group in Washington, 
D.C. for the last 53 years. However, 
because it is not directly affiliated 
with the UC campuses, the regents 
have not allowed money from ref-
erenda to go to it. 

"To say that US SA is not con-
trolled by UC students is true, but 
that makes sense because it works 
at a national level and seeks to 
involve all students," Mahmoud 
said. "To say that because it works 
as national level, it doesn't focus on 
issues pertinent to UCSD students 
is like saying you should only pay 
state tax, because federal tax goes to 
the govern men!', and they won't do 
anything for you as a California cit-
izen." 

Mahmoud also said that the UC 
Regents do not feel that USSA has 
any educational value to the stu-
dents, although USSA gave UCSD 
a grant last year to increase voter 
turnout, in addition to providing 
staff for the Students of Color 
Conference in February. 

"The UC system only wants 
students to lobby through UCSA 
because litsl work is limited to 
wo.king with them; Mahmoud 
said. "If we only work within the 
UC system, we as UC students 
don 't realize that other school sys-
tems interpret national legislation 
more liberally than the UC system 
in some cases. Also, they don't 
want to see our alliances being 
stronger than theirs."

Columbia Union 
Hearings Com~ence 
Case closely resembles New York University 
issue concerning unions on campus 
Iy AMIA DAnA 
Columbia Daily Spectator 

NEW YORK - Tho years ago, 
Rhonda Gottlieb, National Labor 
Relations Board hearings officer, 
could have heard the same lawyers 
as she did Thursday in the Federal 
Plaza building presenting the same 
issue as they did then - whether 
teaching and research assistants 
have the right to unionize at a pri-
vate university. The only difference 
was that this time the university 
challenging that right is Columbia 
University, not New York 
University. 

Hearings began Thursday 
between the University and United 
Auto Workers Local 2110, which is 
affiliated with Graduate Student 
Employees United at Columbia. 
The hearings will ultimately deter-
mine if there will be a union repre-
sentation election at Columbia, a 
vote that could certify a union of 
teaching and research assistants. 

Columbia is represented by 
lawyers from Proskauer Rose LLP, 
which has an anti-union reputa-
tion and represented throughout 
its 43 days of hearings. The UAW is 
represented by the lawyers from 
Levy, Ratner and Behroozi, P.C., 
which represented UAW in the 
NYU case as well . 

[n a departure from the NYU 
case, the UAW is planning to argue 
that undergraduate teaching and 
research assistants should be 
included in the union at Columbia, 
and as such would be eligible to 
vote in an election. 

But there are many similarities 

between the NYU and Columbia 
hearings, most of which are not 
limited to the universities' choices 
of outside legal counsel. Yesterday'S 
proceedings demonstrated that the 
precedent set by the case at NYU, 
which recently became the first pri- . 
vate university to grant graduate 
student union recognition, will 
heavily influence both counsels' 
legal arguments on the question of 
whether graduate students can be 
deemed employees under Section 
2(3) of the National Labor 
Relations Act. 

Columbia maintains that its 
case is different from the NYU case 
in the hope that the NLRB will 
reverse the regional director's deci-
sion, and subsequent failed appeal, 
that mandated an election at NYU. 

"We are fully cognizant of the 
NYU case . . . Our position is that 
the NYU decision is not applicable 
here," said Edward Brill , a 
Proskauer Rose attorney represent-
ing the University at Thursday'S 
hearings. "Columbia is not YU." 

The UAW maintains that the 
board's decision to recognize the 
employee status of teaching and 
research assistants at NYU should 
be upheld with respect to 
Columbia's undergraduate and 
graduate TAs and research assis-
tants. 

Owing to the large impact that 
the NYU ruling will have upon the 
Columbia hearings, any differences 
between teach ing and research 
assistants at NYU and Columbia 
could be potent ia lly significant.

in May 2002, will complete a fourth 
internship this summer at 
Marathon Oil Co. 

She will earn about $12,000 for 
the three months she works. 

"lowe a lot of my success to Ted 
Jacobs," Terry said. "Without him, 
recruiting the companies to come 
to the au campus to interview 
energy management students, find-
ingjobs and internships would be a 
lot more difficult." 

Fabian Bachtiar, energy man-
agement senior, will graduate in 
May. He has already accepted a job 
in Dallas working for Aurora 
Natural- Gas, where he will earn 
$49,000 in his firs t year, plus 
bonuses. 

Bachtiar, who has interned for 
Devon Energy and Arco, said he 
hopes to be making between 
$80,000 and $100,000 within three 
years. 

Students in the energy manage-
men t program take a mix of 
finance, gecisdences and law class-
es. Graduates will be prepared to 
enter the industry in the area of 
production and exploration or 
energy trading, Jacobs said. 

Jacobs said th is ki nd of graduate 
program does not exist any other 
place in the world. 

"It is the energy management 
program that is bringing such 
companies as Duke Energy and 
Enron to au to specifically recruit 
this graduate and while they're 
here, they look at our other gradu-
ates," Jacobs said. 

Duke Energy became aware of 
the program last year after energy 
management senior Jeremy McKee

Two issues that could prove impor-

Bargains for Teachers 

_ in a Buyer's Market 
VERMILLlO ,S.D. - Higher 

education today is a business, no 
question about it. 

It is a market-driven, competi-
tion-propelled corporation tha t 
supplies a demand, satisfies a need 
and creatcs an image. 

And the University of South 
Dakota is no exception. 

Officials call US D a multi fac-
eted institution, pivoting around 
crucial image-en hancing pillars 
such as academics, research, service 
and athletics. 

Exce llence, or perceived excel-
lence, in each of those areas is what 
bolsters student enrollment, 
entices potential faculty, retains 
existing faculty and pleases alumni . 

"There's a competitiv.e, image-
making process that's highly 
important here: said Greg Redlin, 
vice presidcnt of fin ance and 
administration. "It's not a question 
of how good we are, but also of 

part of the bargaining unit," she 
said. "The university'S posi tion is 
that undergraduates are very di ffe r-
ent from the graduates." 

The university will try to show, 
in what is commonly ca lled the 
"educational relatedness" argu-
ment, that teaching duties the 
assistants perfo rm are di rectly 
related to the education they 
receive as students; therefore no 
distinction can be made between 
an assistant's role as student or the 
assistant's role as teacher. 

Interim Dean of the Graduate 
School of the Arts and Sciences 
Gillian Lindt said graduate stu-
dents are not employees of the un i-
versity because the teaching they 
do is a part of their education and 
training.

UAW's counsel. on the other 
hand, will try to show that TAs and 
research assistants are employees 
because they fa ll under two broad 
criteria that the NLRA uses to 
defin e employees, according to 
Julie Kushner, a sub-regional direc-
tor for UAW. 

The first is that employees pro-
vide a service to the employer and 
are compensated for that service. 
The other stipulation is that the 
service they perform is under the 
control and direction of the 
employer. 

David Carpio, a graduate stu-
dent in the biological sciences 
and GSEU member, said the 
nature of the work that TAs and 

research assistants perform is not 
at issue. 

"The nature of the work does 
not determine if one is an employ-
ee or not," he said. 

Carpio referred to. a statement 
that Gottlieb made on the topic. "I 
thought it Was very important that 
the hearing officer ca me out and 
said upfront [thatl to argue the def-
inition of what an employee is, 
you're going to have to stick with 
the legal definition." 

Kushner is confident the UAW 
will be able to demonstrate that 
Columbia graduate studen ts are 
employees. 

"In this case," she said, "there's 
lots of evidence in the documenta-
tion that supports the employee 
status."

. 

ven from the La Valencia Hotel 
in Del Mar, in a telephone inter-
view last Wednesday, Adriana 
Trigiani presented the image of 

an unflappable, yet easy going Italian-
American southerner who has worked hard 
and enjoys the confidence of knowing she is 
successful. 

And she should. Her eclectic resume is one 
that any writer/producer/director would be 
proud of. At the age of 16. she got a job as a 
reporter at WNVA radio in Norton, Va., and 
this began her diversified career through 
American media. 

As a student at Notre Dame/Saint Mary's in 
the mid-eighties, Trigiani was founder of The 
Outcasts, "a fringe, all-girl comedy troupe," 
which she recast when she moved to New 
York after graduating with a degree from the 
theater program. 

When she reached New York, she worked a 
number of odd jobs, including working as a 
temp, but soon found an audience for her 
work and got a television agent. At this lime 
she began working as a writer for the television 
show, "A Different World," starring Kadeem 
Hardison and Jasmine Guy. Before long, how-
ever, Trigiani was working as both a writer and 

producer for the hit television show "The 
Cosby Show." 

Since then, she has written numerous 
award-winning plays that have been shown 
around the country. Additionally, her film doc-
umentary, "Queens of the Bigtime; a full-
length feature that focuses on her family in 
Roseto, Pa., won national and international 
acclaim. 

The list goes on. Her first book, "Big Stone 
Gap," a fictional novel depicting a strong 
Southern woman that was published just last 
year, is a national bestseller. Now, in the after-
glow of receiving recognition for the book that 
Whoopi Goldberg calls, "one of my all time 
favorite novels ... unforgettable; she is now 
directing and writing the script for the movie 
that is being made from "Big Stone Gap." The 
book's sequel, "Big Cherry Holler; is due out 
in May. 

Like the main character of her book, Ave 
Maria Mulligan, Trigiani grew up in the 
Southern town of Big Stone Gap, Va., in the 
'70s. Mulligan, like Trigiani, loved the moun-
tains, books and the theater, but while 
Trigiani left to build her career in New York

TheEditor'sSoapbox 
By JOSH CROUSE 
Features Editor 

OK, so now I'm pissed. 
I've been holding back on this 

issue for a while now, but I can't 
stand it anymore. Americans have 
turned into a bunch of thin-
skinned, lawsuit-happy pansies 
who take a joke about as well as 
Steven Segal acts (l know he can 
kick some ass, but his stone-faced 
_monotony really bugs the shit out 
of me sometimes). 

What am [ talking about? I'll 
tell ya. I'm talking about not being 
able to talk to people without hav-
ing to bite my tongue because I'm 
worried that I might offend them 
in some way and get sued. It's 
utterly ridiculous. 

It's getting to be so bad that 
you.car't turn on the television or 
read a newspaper without hearing 
about some lawsuit that stemmed 
from people who didn't get their 
way . . 

The most recent of these prob-
lems is the increased violence on 
school campuses. The motives 
behind the shootings may differ, 
but their origins remain the same. 
They all involved kids who didn 't 
get what they wanted , so they 
lashed out violen tly. At both 
Columbine and Santana High 
School, the kids were bullied so 
much that they struck back with 
force in an effort to deal with their 
own discomfort. In the Granite 
Hills shooting, the student was 
rejected from the Navy and 

The UCSD Guardian 

Society Is· HandUng the 
Recent School Shootings 
the Wrong Way 

blamed it on an administrator at 
the high school. 

If you look closely, these kids 
are nothing but a product of their 
environments. I'm not talking 
about the music they listen to, the 
video games they play or the 
movies they watch. I'm talking 
about the way that our society has 
taught them to think. 

Think about it. From birth. 
people are trained to think that 
they ' have certain rights that 

It's getting to be so bad 
that you can't tum on 
the television or read a 
newspaper without 
hearing about some 
lawsuit that stemmed 
from people who didn't 
get their way. 
nobody can take away. It's the typ-
ical American mindset that we 
have all been sucked into. We are 
taught that anyone who makes us 
feel uneasy is infringing on our 
rights and that action can, and 
should, be taken. 

These kids saw people being 
sued for writing or saying some-
thing that made another person 
feel badly. They saw people even 
going to jail for it. In school, they 
saw other kids getting detention 
for calling another child a bad 

name. They were exposed to this 
for their entire lives. Their brains 
were trained to think that it was 
an unquestionable system of pun-
ishment for infringing upon oth-
ers' "right to feel good about 
themselves .• 

That is why they were so out-
raged when they encountered 
something that made them feel 
badly and nothing was done 
about it. There were other stu-
dents, and in one case even the 
Navy, who made these kids feel 
bad about themselves. When they 
saw that the system of crime and 
punishment that they had been 
trained to believe in and follow 
blindly was not bringing them 
justice, they decided to take jus-
tice into their own hands. 

[ am by no means trying to jus-
tify what these kids did. [ person-
ally think that they should be tried 
as adults and spend the rest of 
their lives in jail, but that's anoth-
er rant altogether. All that [ am 
saying is that we, as a society, need 
to take some responsibility for 
what occurred. [ concede that, in 
the end, it was those kids who 
ultimately made the decision to 
lash out, but we can't absolve our-
selves of all blame. We can't sim-
ply blame it on personal lifestyles 
just so we can sleep better at 
night. If we do that, then we are 
simply leaving the door wide open 
for similar events to take place in 
the future.

HOR.OSCOPES 

By LUHA SENIUK 
Tribune Media Services 

Arle. (March 21-April19) 
Early this week, Aries, an unusu-

al flirtation may be distracting. For 
the next four days, new friends and 
colleagues will offer unexpected 
gestures of affection, trust or admi-
ration . For some Aries natives, espe-
cially those born between 1954 and 
1962, a new romance will now trig-
ger workplace tensions. If so, wait 
for a calmer atmosphere to arrive: 
All will be well. After Friday, also 
watch for a fast announcement 
from a close relative. Highlighted 
are life plans, career goals and quick 
relocations. 

Taurus (April 2()'May 20) 
Honest discussions will be an 

important theme this week, Taurus. 
Before Thursday, watch for loved 
ones to plan fresh social activities 
or family events. Ironically, Taurus, 
this new atmosphere of group 
acceptance may also create minor 
tensions between friends and rela-
tives. Open communications will 
resolve all interpersonal problems. 
Taurus: Don't avoid difficult sub-
jects. Later this week, a decision in 

a key rela tionship may be neces-
sary. Watch for small ultimawms 
and unusual roma ntic overtures. 

Gemini (May 21-June 21) 
Creativ ity and rare business 

contacts are on the agenda this 
week, Gem: Promising employ-
ment inroads will soon offer pow-
erful rewards. After Tuesday. watch 
for increased paperwork or finan -
cial messages from authority fig-
ures. Many Geminis will soon 
explore fresh work outlets and 
business partnerships. Research 
will be key, Gem: Closely examine 
all possibilities. After Friday, com-
plex romantic and social tensions 
will fade: Rest, pamper the body 
and enjoy new friendsh ips. 
Cancer (June 22·July 22) 

Late Tuesday, a previously silent 
work official or manager may 
request help in a difficult project. 
Offer assistance, Ca ncer, but avoid 
publicly choosing sides between 
colleagues. Until key decisions are 
made co-workers and close fri ends 
will be protective of their own 
ideas. Play the diplomat - group 
dynamics will be delicate for the 
next eight days. After Wednesday. 
social invi tations will quickly 
increase. Expect unique outdoor 
ideas and exciting group' entertain-
ment. Join in, Cancer; All is well. 

Leo (July 23-Aug. 22) 
New friendships and gentle 

romantic flirtat ions will be ddigh t-
ful before Wednesday. Leo: Expect 
others to be drawn to your con ti -
dence and uniqu e socia l style. 
Some Leos may soon find it neces-
sary to decide between twO com-

toward women, she was fortunate 
enough to always have powerful 
female role models. 

"I never had the sense that I 
couldn 't do something because I 
was a girl," Trigiani said. "Both of 
my grandmothers owned their own 
businesses, and my mother always 
encouraged me." 

Another part of her success 
seems to come from her love for 
what she does. While growing up 
in Big Stone Gap, she was a prolif-
ic writer. She continued her love 

pharmacist and as 
a volunteer ambu-

is also the director 
of the tOwn theater

for writing in col-
lege, where she 
wrote numerous 
plays that were all 
well-received. 

"I was always

said. "Even in a 
small coal-mining 
town, when I didn't 
know there were 
jobs for what I 

would make her vulnerable to 
hurt, and reveal to the world thal 
she does need to be loved . 

During the course of the year, 
the changes predicted by her 
Chinese face-reading philosophy 
do take place, and they help 
Mulligan to discover family 
secrets and the secrets within her-
self that have hindered her ability 
to be a pan of a successful rela-
tionship. . 

"I wouldn't know what to do 
with a man," says Mulligan. "Hook 
him? Serve him? Then pray he 
never leaves? How do you do it 
without dying? How?" 

Although she is happi ly mar-
ried, Mulligan's struggle may have 
been a reflection of Trigiani's own 
life. In her interview, Trigiani said 
that women often have to figure 
out how they can balance success 
with . personal happiness, and 
Mulligan exemplifies this internal 
emotional struggle. 

"Women have to be indepen-
dent, and we also have to be emo-
tionally avai lable," Trigiani said. 

As a strong and successful 
woman, 11'igiani admits that gen-
der has always played a factor in 
her life. However, she was lucky to 
receive the support from her fami-
ly that she needed to succeed. She 
says that, although Italians are' 
known for patriarchal attitudes

Trigiani admits that success is 

sometimes difficult, but says that it 
is obtainable if you are' able to 
manage it . 

"If you have it and claim it, it is 
yours," she said. 

In the sequel. "Big Cherry 
Holler," Mulligan, again the main 
character, will re-examine her life 
to try to figure out why, after truly 
discovering herself in the first 
book, she keeps making the same 
mistakes. Trigian i describes th e 
new book as full of plot twists that 
the reader never could or would 
have expected in the first book. 

According to 11'igiani, "You'll be 
blown away." 

Trigiani, we already are.

old-school Astroturf that we all 
grew up seeing on television. It is 
d nc\\', improved artificial turf. It 
h,IS the feci of real grass when you 
stand on it. 

There are benefi ts to the fake 
SlUff. such as low maintenance 
needs, and it is not as expensive to 
maintain, either. And the nega-
tives are not nearly as bad as with 
the old artificial turf. The stuff is 
not that bad. But still, I have a 
problem with it. 

lt just gets to me that it is fake. 
I mean, is nothing sacred any-

and that the rubber provides a

House, however. did have two 
complaints - one bei ng that 
sliding on thc turf co uld be 
painful. 

"I still have a burn on my knee

o marks from Mother Earth on 

a soccer player after a sliding kick. 
No pieces of turf hanging out of a 
football player's face mask. No 
mud in someone's mouth. It is 
just fake. 

This would be UCSD's fake 
watering can, our fake Chinese 
rubber plant, our fake plastic 
earth . It just wears me out. 

I can see us 30 years from now 
singing "Where have you gone, 
real grass? A nation turns its 
lonely eyes to you ." 

I noticed that the Chargers 
traded away their No. 1 pick and 
got LaDanian Tomlinson with the 
fifth pick. Though the team had a 
great draft, I feel Atlanta got the 
better of them. Only the futun: 
will tell , and Vick's progress will 
determine, whether the Chargers 
made a good move. Bu t the

House also noted the artificial 
turf's behavior when wet from 
rain. 

"When it 's wct, it 's a little bit 
slippery, and sometimes the rub-
ber gets up in your eyes," he said. 

"It won't look like 
someone's back patio. 
This stuff looks just like 
the real thing."

trade. They shou ld have received 
Atlanta's first-round choice next 
year or a premier player. Instead, 
they got the Falcons' No.2 pick 
next year and Tim Dwight. 
Dwight is a nice football player, 
but in no way should he be men-
tioned in trade ta lks regarding a 

o. 1 pick. The Chargers should 
have asked for Jamal Anderson, 
the Falcons' o. 1 pick this year 
and next year, for what the Charg-
ers gave up. Ridiculous. 

Looks like Michael Jordan wi ll 
be coming back. And along with 
him Charles Barkley. This, I must 
admit, is really amazing. Even if 
they bomb, they'll be fu n to 
watch . Ah, the memories. Sir 
Charles is quoted as saying that 
the teams are only looking for a 
big man. Hell, bring Bill Russell 
out of retirement - he's not up to 
much of anything other than seil -

was wet, but it wasn't muddy at 
all, which was nice: he said. 

Ford said he did not see a 
major problem with people get-
ting burned from sliding on the 
surface. 

"A few guys got a little burned, 
but it's not really an issue," he 
said. "I played the whole year at 
linebacker and I never got 
burned." 

He also said that the FieldTurf 
seemed to get hotter than the old 
tield did in the sun. 

Despite the drawbacks they 
mentioned, Ford and HOLise 
agrec that they prefer the artificial 
turf to natural grass. 

"It's great - perfect," Ford 
sa id.

"It's the best field I've ever 

played on." he said.

Track Participates in 
Pomona Invitational 
Stars Sung, Mimnaugh and

By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Associate Sports Editor 

Last week, the men's and women's 
track and fie ld teams trave led 
north to partlclpate in the 
Pomona-Pitzer Invitational, a large 
meet featuring teams and ath letes 
from around the country and 
world. In total, the meet had over 
1,500 participating athletes. 

Impressively enough, consider-
ing the amount of competition, the 
Tritons had several fin ishers in the 
top 10. 

On the women's side, Audrey 
Sung's time of 4:43.36 was enough 
to give her 10th place in the 1500-

we have struggled this year, 
but the majority of our games 
have been close. We need to SlOp 
making little mistakes that are 
costing us ball games. We have 
ended up on the wrong side of 100 
many onc-run and two-run ball 
games." 

In a pair of late games on Sun-
day, UCSD picked up two wins. 

With the game on the line in 
the first game and down three 

meter run out of over 60 partici-
pants. Kelly Mimnaugh vaulted 
3.0S meters to grab eighth, and 
Clara Wilson's jump of 5.47 meters 
earned her eighth place in the long 
jump event. 

For the men,)on Wong nabbed

the BOO-meter dash wi th a time of

in the 1 SOO-meter run to take eighth 
place for the Tritons. Rob Ewanio 
came in tenth in the shotput with a 
heave of 16.57 meters. 

Having tuned up in the 
Pomona-Pitzer Invitational , the 
Tritons will gear up for this week-
end, when they travel to Irvine to 
participate in the California- eva-

runs in the bottom of the ninth, 
the Tritons ca me back with four 
runs in the bottom of the inning 
to defeat their rivals fro m Davis, 
7-6 . 

In the second game, the Tritons 
brought out the bats, winning 8-2. 

The record improv~s their sea-
son total to 12-29, and 6-22 in the 
conference. 

"We know we can compete; we 
just need to start pulling out some 
victories," Addison said. "Playing 
against Davis is no differen t to us 
than playing aga inst anyone else in 
the CCAA. It doesn't matter who it 
is - as long as it is a conference 
game, there is always a little more 
emotion involved."

L aSl year. the men's volley-ball program was cut by the San Diego State's athletics 
progr'lIl1. 

A few weeks ago, mcm bers of 
that now-defunct squad wanted to 
tr\ out for another tcam: the 
women's vollevball team. 

The Cahforl1la State University 
system has deemed that the guys 
wtll not be allowed to try out for 
the team. . 

The men's reasoning for trylllg 
out for the women 's team is Title 
I X, legislation that mandated 
L'LjualllY 111 collegia te and high 
sci l<)0 I athkllcs. 

In part, it states, "No person in 
the United States shall , on the 
b.lSls of sex, be excluded from par-
IIlipatiol1 111 , be denied the benefits 
L1f. ,)r be subJn:ted to discrimina-
tion unda any education program 
or activity receiving federal linan-
cial assIstance." 

Titic IX has beel1 a wonderful 
thlllg, enabling many women to 
partiCIpate in sports from which 
they had previously been disen-
franchIsed. Before the 1972 ruling, 
women's athletics were essentially 
an afterthough t. Now women 
share the spotlight in collegiate 
sports. 

It's Just too bad that Title IX 
does not seem to apply both ways. 

The men at SDSU are being 
excluded fro m participation in 
sports and denied benefits on the 
basis of gender. 

SDSU offers six men's athletics 
programs, and the women have 11. 
Sure, the men have football, which 
has a number of players, but 11 
teams against 6? That is disparity. 

Maybe football is at fau lt since 
it has so much attention given to it. 

ow, while I am not saying that 
the women's volleyball team 
should become co-ed. The premise 
at work here disturbs me. Every 
oncc in a while, one hears about a 
female athlete trying Ollt for a 
men's athletic team, and she is 
lauded' for her bravery and for 
breaking new ground. She gets a 
nice fluffy Story in the news. While 
I applaud women who try to break 
ncw ground, it upsets me that 
when men try the same in reci-
procity, the story is tucked in the 
back of the paper, an afterthought. 

What is also alarming about 
this is that it could happen here. 
Without money, athletics cannot 
survive. UCSD needs some money 
fast or there is the possibility that 
programs may get cut. 

Other stuff .... 

I was lucky enough to get a call 
from Don Chadwick, who is 
UCS D's director of sports facilities, 
and he invited me to take a look at 
an example of the artificial turf that 
the school hopes to place at Muir 
Field. A couple of weeks ago, I tore 
into the idea of artificial turf. Don 
took me to La Jolla High School to 
show me what the stuff really is. 

I must admit, the fake stuff is

Tritons notch two wins, knocking off Davis 7-6, 8-2 
By ARVIND VASAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's baseball 
team played host to its rivals 
from UC Davis for a four game 
series that took place on Triton 
field Friday and Sunday. 

The first game featured a 

match-up between the Aggies' 
Luke Steidl mayer, younger 
brother of UCSD men's tennis 
head coach Eric Steidlmayer, and 
the Tritons' Andy Hanau, whp 
was looking for his third win of 
the season. UC Davis came off 
the block first with runs in the 
second and fifth innings. UCSD 

kept it close with good pitching 
and good relief work. The game, 
however, got away from the Tri-
tons in the eighth inning as 
Davis' Shaun McCullough 
homered, bringing in John Car-
rion and adding two RBIs to his

Triton men's 
tennis comes up 
short, 4-5 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's tennis tcam 
clashed with Point Loma Nazarene 
University last f-riday and came OUl 
on the short end of a 5-4 score 
against the Crusaders. 

The Triton singles players 
struggled against their opponents, 
dropping four of the six si ngles 
matches. UCSD's top singles play-
er, Sameer Chopra, lost to Roqrigo 
Suatez in straight se ts 2-6, 6-7. 
The Tritons' o. 2 pla;'er, Jeff Wil-
son, was also defeated in straight 
sets by Point Lorna's iklas 
Rohdin 6-7, 2-6. However, Dan 
Albrecht ended the Crusaders' 
streak by spanking No. 3 Chad 
Abby 7-5, 6-3. . 

The other three singles match-
cs were all particularly clos\:, as 
th ey all took three sets to deter-
mine the winner. Unfortunately, 
Poi nt Lorna was the winner in 
two of those three matches. Jason 
Kasner beat UCSD's Amir Nejad 
6-7, 7-5, 6-2. Point Loma's Joe 
Combs was also victorious over 
Sean Higginbotham 6-2, 2-6, 6-1 . 
Everett Schroeter was the only 
other UCSD men's singles win-
ner, as he beat Ben Roberson 4-6, 
6-1,6-3 . 

The Tritons fared a little better 
on the doubles side of the court , 
taking two of the three matches. 
UCSO's Wilson and Cory Moder-
hak lost to Suarez and Abby, 8-6, 
but Tritons Michael Meyer and 
Chopra were victorious over 
Rohdin and Kasner 8-2, and 
Schroeter and Albrecht beat up on 
Point Loma's Matt Clinton and 
Roberson 8-4. 

The loss drops the men's tennis 
team's record to 4-5 in league and 
8-9 on the season. 

The Tritons will be looking to 
even th!!ir record next Tuesday as 
they take on Cal Poly Pomona on 
the ,road in their regular season 
finale. 

FieldTurf: The Grass Is Always Greener 
Proposed Campus-Life Fee includes newest artificial turf for Muir Field 
By JEFfREY WHITE 
Senior Staff Writer 

The proposed insta llation of 
artificial turf on Muir Field is a 
very controversial item in the 
Campus-Life Fee Referendum. It 
may also be one of the most mis-
understood, according to Don 
Chadwick, UCSD's director of 
sports faciliti es. 

What he said students are vot-
ing on in the special election this 
week is not the typical green-col-
ored carpet seen in many domed 
sports stadiums played on by the 
NFL and Major League Baseball. 

"It won 't look like someone's 
back patio,· Chadwick said. "This 
stuff looks just like the real 
thing." 

The product being considered 
is called FieldTurf, which is the 
newest technology in artificial sur-

faces designed to simulate the 
look and feel of real turf, without 
the inherent drawbacks of natural 
grass. 

FieldTurf is a synthetic grass 
covering that differs from what is 
popularly known as Astroturf; it 
is not a green plastic carpet laid 
over a thin layer of under-
padding. 

Instead, a mixture of silica 
sand and small pieces of rubber 
is distributed among the blades 
of artificial grass, creating a sur-
face that is soft, does not com-
press, has superior drainage and 
provides ample traction and foot-
ing. 

The rubber is made of recon-
stituted rubber from Nike athletic 
shoes. 

According to Campus Recre-
ation Director Chuck Gormley, 
Muir Field is a nightmare to main-

tain because it is so frequently 
used by students and sports 
leagues. 

"We've redone Muir Field 
twice, and it still won't come up 
right; he said. "And it's anguish-
ing to tell teams that they can't use 
the field because it rained for two 
days." 

Gormley said that the main 
advantages of FieldTurf are its 
virtual immunity to negative 
affects from inclement weather 
and its relatively low maintenance 
cost. 

He estimates the current cost 
of maintaining Muir Field at 
$100,000 per year, including the 
cost of watering, fertilizing and 
repairing the turf. 

Gormley said that installing the 
artificial turf would be cost-effec-
tive in the long run, despite its 
upper six-figure price tag for the 

initial installation. 
"It ends up being cheaper Ithan 

a natural field], " Gormley said. 
"The only maintenance is ... every 
couple of weeks a machine is dri -
ven over the field to redistribute 
the sand and rub5Cr.~ 

The company that produces 
FieldTurf advertises that the sur-
face has a 12- to 15-year lifespan. 
How.ever, the company is only 

. three years old, so these claims 
cannot be confirmed. 

FieldTurf was recently 
installed on football field s at 
Grossmont College and La Jolla 
High School, the only two fields 
of their kind in California south 
of Ventura.

Thomas House, who played cen-
ter for the junior varsity football
