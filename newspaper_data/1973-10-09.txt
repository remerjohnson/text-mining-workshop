National Student Association Advocates' Union 
by Philip W. Semas 

Miami Beach (CPS) - If the leaders of the National 
Student Association have their way, college 
administrators will soon be bargaining not only with 
unions of janitors, secretaries, and professors but also 
with unions of students. 

For the third straight year, talk of creating a national 
student union was a dominant theme at the 
association's annual National Student Congress. 

Delegates passed a resolution declaring unionization 
of students to be a top priority and establishing a three-
member task force "to investigate and work toward the 
unionization of all colleges and universities that 
express interest in unionization ." 

The resolution also declared that N.S.A. would "be 
the national collective bargaining agent on campuses 
subject to the approval of each individual campus." 

As a first step, the association's new president, larry 
Friedman of Queens College in New York City, said he 
wanted to prepare "model 'contracts' between 
students and their schools" to help students prepare to 
"cope with the realities of faculty unions." . 

The students had at least two goals for creating a 
union: 

-Resuscititing the moribund national student 
movement. 

-Meeting the challenge of faculty collective 
bargaining, which student leaders fear will leave them 
out in the cold. 

The students generally agreed that the national 
student movement that dominated the 1960's was 
dead. " We are here in Miami Beach for the funeral of 
the student movement," said Ron Ehrenreich, the 
outgoing N.S.A. vice-president. 

Delegates felt that the creation of a national student 
political organization such as an individual-member 
national union of students which is what most

Tax Initiative 
and the University 

Hannah Cohen 
California voters will be asked to vote on the Reagan 

Tax Initiative, Proposition 1 on the specia l November 6 
ballot. 

The basic goal of the initative is to put a ceiling on 
future state budgets, based on an annually falling 
portion of state personal income. Governor Reagan 
feels that such a low budget limit will not cause future 
state budgets to be cut. 

However, A. Alan Post, the official state non -partisan 
fiscal watchdog for the past twenty-five years, is 
convinced that a budget ceiling will cause "damaging 
slashes in future state budgets. 

One area that will be. the first to be effect is those 
state funds slated for higher education and financial 
aid. Such unds will either have to be cut or completely 
eliminated. 

Such cuts might also cause the regents to raise tuition 
at the University of California to make up for this lack 
of needed revenues. 

For the first time in California's history tuition might 
also be required at the California State University and 
College system and the local community colleges. 

Such tuition hikes might possibly force many low-
income students to forgo higher education entirely. 

Because of the above dangers to college tuitions at 
all levels, Congressman Jerry Waldie, has labeled 
Porposition 1 the "Tuition Initiative." 

The manager of the campaign for Proposition 1 has 
publicly admitted that a low voter turnout on Nov. 6 is 
necessary for the passage of the Initiative. Turnout of 
over 50% could doom the tax scheme. 

Waldie says that since such specia l ele tions are 
usually characterized by a "Iow voter turnout, with 
those voting being primarily conservatives," a strong 
effort by a small district voter group coul d swing th 
election. 

He feels that the small group that could carry the ball 
against the Initiative on Nov. 6 are the students voters . 
There are over 1 million college students in California 
who will be effected by the future effects of 
Proposition 1. 

For this reason Waldi and other Democratic 
congressmen opposed to Proposition 1 have launched 
a massive drive to register all those college students of 
voting age. 

European countries have, could turn some student 
energy back to national issues. 

Concern about the effects of increasing faculty 
unionization was also apparent. 

American Federation of Teachers representative 
Israel Kugler told one session of students that students 
and faculty shared such areas of common concern as 
class size, physical facilities, academic freedom, and the 
over-use of graduate teaching assistants. He said the 
A.F.T. has a slogan: "What students want, teachers 
need" and that it "advocates that students organize 
and bargain on their own over issues that concern 
them and get rid of the shameful facade called student 
government." 

Alan Shark, chairman of the student senate at the 
City University, said the union's suggestion that 
students organize and bargain separately really means 
that they want sutdents to bargain over dormitory rules 
and student servces and let the faculty care of 
promotion, tenure, curriculum, and calss size. 

He suggested that a student union could negotiate 
over such things as student evaluation of faculty 
members, grievance procedures for students treated 
unfairly by professors or administrators, grading 
policies, class size, and academic freedem. 

"There is nothing in faculty collective bargaining that 
involves protecting students," Shark said. "Faculty 
unionization is to protect faculty rights. 

The way to counter that , he and others argues, is for 
students to form their own unions. While most of the 
students supported the idea of student unionization, 
many questioned whether N.S.A. is the best 
organization for creating a union. 

In the six years since it stopped taking money from 
the Central Intelligence Agency, NS.A. has had to 
devote much of its energy to simple financial survival. 
In the years immediately after its C.I.A. ties were 
revealed, N .S.A.'s dificits grew to half a million dollars.

NADER 

Nader to Speak 
R.Drom 

Ralph Nader, whose name is synonomous with 
consumerism and the public's rights, will speak at Mesa 
College in San Diego tomorrow night. 

Nader's visit to San Diego is being sponsored by the 
California Public In.terest Research Group (CALPIRG) 
and the A.S. at Mesa . Tickets will be sold at the Urey 
Hall Box office and at the door as well. 

Nader has received national publicity due to th 
many consumer action projects which he has 
originated. He has also been inspirational in th 
formation of CALPIRG here in San Diego. 

Nader will peak on a variety of topics Wedn day, 
October 10th at 8:00 P.M. in the Me a gym. Th e will 
range from orporate and governm ntal responsibility 
to the responsibility each citizen ha for his so iety. 

Last year Nad r spok to a capacity crowd at 
Gro smont College and praised the rol that AlPIRG 
was playing in the public's int rest. H wa appre iativ 
of the CALPIRG food-pri e surveys and th aff t that 
they had had on keeping the food prices in San Diego 
lower than most of the nation . 

Car pools will b arranged for anyon de iring to 
attend the talk and who doe not have a rid . 
Interested peopl who can give rides or who n d 
them hould call Ellen Wil on, th UC D hairp r on 
of CAlPIRG, at "52-0288. 

Over the last few years N.S.A. has reduced that debt 
ot the point where it is now down to S25,OOO. Even so, 
N.S.A. endured another financial crises this year, 
mainly because it did not get the support from private 
foundations that it had received in the past . 

Outgoing president Tim Higgins suggested that the 
Association's financial resources would really only 
allow it to carry on its most basic programs, such as 
providing information to student governments, 
providing legal information and assistance to students, 
and running its annual congress. Any other activities 
would have to be financed with foundation or other 
outside funds, he said. 

If N.S.A. wants to unionize students, Higgins argued, 
it must "create an independently financed 
organization, capable of political action, democraticaly 
constituted, and supported actively by individual 
members. If N.S.A. creates another unsupported 
political organization, I believe we would be doomed 
to minimal and fragmented support and eventual 
dissolution ." 

He also argued that to politically effective, such a 
student union must build su pport by providing services 
to its members. 

Higgins argued that N.S.A. must work through 
student governments because they have funds and 
recognition by their universities . 

Others disagreed. In fact, N.S.A.'s status as an 
association of student government was one of the 
things that made some critics question whether it could 
serve as a jumping off point for a student union. 

"Student governments are bankrupt," said 
Ehrenreich, last year's vice-president, who split with 
Higgins. "You can't work through student 
governments becuase they don't represent sutdents. 

Critics also pointed out that unionization had been 
declared a top priority at the last two N.S.A. congresses

Stanford Paper and 
Police Raids 

(CPS) - Prompted by a police search of psychiatric 
records at a local hospital, the staff of the University of 
Stanford Daily recently filed suit, for the second time in 
tow years, seeking a preliminary injunction against 
future searches of its campus office. 

The Daily staff sought similar relief following a police 
search of their office in April, 1971 . 

At that time, Palo Alto police and Santa Clara sheriff's 
deputies, armed with search warrants, earched the 
Daily staff's files, desks and personal belongs for 
photographs of a recent campus sit-in . They left empty-
handed. 

Later that year, a U.S. District Court Judge ruled the 
search illegal and unconstitutional under th first , 
fourth, fifth and fourteenth amendments of the U .. 
Constitution . The judge ciritcized issuance of search 
warrants to police for the purpose of inflicting a search 
on a party not suspected of a crime. 

He termed the use of search warrants an "excessive 
measure" which left the Daily staff with no legal 
recourse. 

The judge refused, howev~r, to issue an injunction 
preventing further searches, explaining that it wa 
unnecessary since polic would obe the ruling of the 
court . 

That decision is currently und r appeal b th Palo 
Alto police department. 

Over the summer, inve tigators Ir m the 10 al 
district attorney' offi , again used earch warrant f 
this time to seek p y hiatric r ords at tanford 
Hospital. Similarity of th two ca e led th Daily taff 
to file suit a second time, requ~ ting that the court 
i su a p rman nt injunction again t further arch . 

A spoke person for the Daily taff xpr d d ubt 
that a court would issue such an injun tion , de pit tl,e 
Palo Alto police d partm nt' disrl'gard for th earli r 
ourt ruling.

Joni Gal ood 

A. tew I'ean ago I met a couple through friends of the 
family. The husband was a research scientist at a 

universit~' while the wife wrote short stories and 
practiced law. They were an engaging pair although 
somewhat argumentitive over a question regarding the 
relationship between art and science in society. 

She believe that art initially inspired the scientist to 
create, and he said that he knew of no such sensation. 
She countered that one does not have to be aware of a 
sensation for it ti exist, and he said that was pure 
nonsense. The conversation continued with its 
accusations and rebuttals, until everyone became 
thoroughly bored by the topic. 

However, she insisted on having the final word. A. 
month later I found a short story in a magazine that 
immediately reminded me of that evening. I called the 
wife and asked if she had written the piece. She said 
yes, but quickly replied that it was not up to her best 
work. I silently agreed but complimented her on its 
ingenuity and then promptly bid goodbye. 

The story is reprinted now, principally because I feel 
that the arts and science do stand together in this 
society, dispite the smugness in both camps regarding 
the supposed su periority of each. Hopefully, the 
following will se rve to illustrate the logical bond 
between these two pillars of academia. 

Once upon a time there was a man who in his youth 
discovered a tree. It swayed in the wind, it was st rong, 
nubile, and oh, so handsome that the young man 
naturally identified with the young tree. Even though a 
sapling, winter had come and gone, proving that it was 
resolute. "So am II" said the man. Despite thin 
branches the tree has already produced its first harvest 
of fruit. "Although young, I am productive too!" said 
the man. 

Nevertheless, the youth felt a sadness, because while 
he could roam about and discover new lands, the tree 
could not. It was forever to be rooted in the same 
clump of earth . From sympathy (for he pitied his 
crippled friend), the man brought forth his writing 
tools and created a poem just then. It was entitled, "To 
Tree .... 

Stupid, ridiculous man! Satisfied that he had 
preserved the bond between himself and the tree with 
his poem, he walked away, unbelievably haughty . But 
let us forgive him, because he was still young. Later, 
much later, he returned to precisely the same spot. The 
tree was there, mature, but far from the death the old 
man feared he himself was approaching. His 
adventures, his loves, his successes amounted to 
nothing when the old man began to understand the 
order of life; nothing, when compared to the tree that 
would continue to live after his death. Why was this sol 
What secret did the tree have that taunted the old man 
and made him scream in a fit of rage and terror? 

.. Ah, if only I were younger, I would make it my 
business to answer this strange mystery of th tree." 
cried the old man . "Through my discoveries the bond 
between us would grow much closer and I would not 
be dead nearly so soon." 

In his infirmerous condition and highly agitated 
state, he began to imagine that the tree was mocking 
him and all the other men who had idly composed 
sonnets and odes beneath its shade, never questioning 
the true essence of the tree. The old man though that 
the tree was laughing aloud, so he ~aid "Shut up, tree", 
but the tree still chuckled by the rustling of its leaves. 

But what of the poem? The old manknew that his 
writing tools had a purpose, or else they would not 
exist. Yet the poem seemed so silly now, even though 
its theme of youthful ambition and expectations 
intertwined with the branches of the tree possessed a 
haunting, lyrical beauty that still made the pulse of the 
old man race with pleasure. It is a poem, only, he 
thought , and not worth an evenings meal. Thus with a 
last, agonizingly painful gasp for fresh air, the old man 
died, with the poem clutched in his hand. 

A few minutes passed and a young man' happened to 
walk by. He was listed by the government as a research 
scientist, but he did not have a project . As the old 
man was still warm it appeared to the youth that he was 
sleeping, so he began to tiptoe away. Suddenly the 
fingers of the old man released the poem and the wind 
sent it directly in the path of the youth . He picked it up 
and read it once, twice, not quite th ree times. 

"This is rather good. As a matter of fact, it is very 
similar to the poem I wrote last week about the sea, 
and a fr end of mine composed an excellent version on 
the life J f the honeybee . . . yes, there is a pattern here, 
but I can't seem to find its form ." 

The youth was perplexed. He felt as though he had 
walked jnto a cave, yet he prefered to grope in the dark 
rather ,!Jan walk out. He began to breath like the old 
man ha·:J a moment before, and he was sure that he was 
going I) perish , dllllvugh hi hndy and soul still felt 
quite st 'ong and unchallenged. 

He "Ioked at the tree. It was poised, silent, and 
wa iting (or so it seemed to the youth) , Stuffing the 
po m i' lto his pickt:t, he walked to the tree and picked 
some fruit from its limbs. He did not eat, but examined 
the vol Jptuous symmetry of the object in his hand, its 
color, ils texture, its size. 

The youth I aned against the trunk of the tree and 
smiled . He now knew that h would know this tree 
better than anyone else. He felt as though his life had 
assum d meaning and substance. And when he was an 
old man he would say to others, "Now, this is a tree. 
Listen carefully, while I tell you why you must respect 
it, because it, too, is a system that is as magnificent as 
you or I." 

The youth then remembered the old man and 
solemly walked up the path to return his poem.

Lecture on Transcendental Meditation 
Many students at UCSD 

have heard about Trans-
cendental Meditation (TM) 
either from friends or by 
attending introductory 
lectures sponsored by the 
Students International 
Meditation Society (SIMS). 

At the lectures or from 
friends one hears claims 
about the benefits of 
practicing TM twice each 
day, for 20 minutes, which 
is the prescribed amount of 
time. The claims are along 
the lines of greater energy, 
happiness and stability, 
improved grades, more 
harmonious relationships, 
and a greater appreciation 
of the environment. These 
who decide to take up the 
practice generally begin to 
experience the sa me 
results. 

However, there still arise 
questions as to how two 
periods of meditation each 
day can bring improve-
ments on so many varied 

levels of life. With this in '

point, the delegates voted to call for the staff's

What made this year different, some observers said 
is the threat of faculty collective bargaining and the fact 
that this N.S.A. congress ended on a note of unity, 
rather than the divisiveness that has afflicted the 
association for the last six years. 

Ever since 1967, the year of the C.I.A. disclosures, 
N.S.A. congresses have been the scenes of angry

As it stands now, the 
commuter can take the R

5 express back up to Claire-
mont, or take the R bus to 
Felspar ; catch the 
crosstown j bus and then 
transfer to the 5 or the 5 
express . Either way the trip 
(16 miles by way of the j bus 
and 34 miles by the 
downtown route to Claire-
mont Square, - for a 
student with a car the 
distance is 6.5 miles) takes 
over an hour each way. The 
trip downtown is necessary 
because the J bus does not 
run after 6:40 PM and, as a 
matter of fact, the 5 express 
quits at 6:30 PM and one 
has to take the much 
slower 5 bus. 

For example, su ppose 
you get out of lab at exactly 
5:00 PM, run over to the 
bus and catch the 5:05 R

options, downtown or 
crosstown. If you missed

Polynesian 
Art Exhibit 

A major exhibition of more than 150 works of 
Polynesian art and Western impressions of Polynesian 
culture will open Tuesday, October 9, at the Fine Arts 
Gallery in Balboa Park. . 

The seven-week show, titled " Dimensions of 
Polynesia," has been assembled from over 30 museums 
and private collections throughout the world by 
Jehanne Teilhet, assistant professor of visual arts at the 
University of California, San Diego, and a number of 
her students. 

The exhibit ion includes sculpture, feather capes, 
bowls, · tapa cloth, portions of house facades, 
ornamentation, war clubs, and other ceremonial and 
secular objects. Also planned are photographs, slides 
and tape recordings of religious chants. 

Illustrating the Western vision of Polynesia are 
paintings, engravings and sculpture by artists Paul 
Gauguin, John la Farge, and Sydney Parkenson whose 
art focuses on the area. 

The idea for the exhibition was a product of Miss 
Teilhet's studies of primitive art, her travels in Polynesia 
and a previous show she produced in 1970 called 
" Dimensions of Black" which featured Afro-American 
art. 

According to Miss Teilhet, "limited research has 
been done on the traditional cultural heritage of the 
area. As a result, the public's average contact with the 
Polynesian culture is a romanticized version of a Pacific 
paradise, only a small facet of the total view." 

" Dimensions of Polynesia," the first major 
Polynesian exhibit ion to be shown west of the 
Mississippi, is an attempt to give a well -rounded 
picture of the Polynesian culture and to make a 
contribution to Polynesian studies at the same time, 
she said. 

The show presents an image of the Polyne~ian islands 
(Tonga, Samoa, the Hawaiian Islands, Easter Island, 
Marquesas, Tuamotu, the Cook Islands, the Society 
Islands, New Zealand, and Fiji) as they exist d when 
Captain Cook and early explorers in the 18th century 
encountered them before extensive Europ an contact. 
It will illustrate the many complex factors in the 
indigenous arts of the civilization of those Pacific 
islands, delineating the traditional arts as well as 
displaying the Western artists' views of their culture. 

According to Miss Teilhet, the show is unique in that 
Southern California has the largest concentrated 
population of Polynesians outside the islands. The 
exhibition will reflect the rich cultural traditions of the 
area of which the arts, as visual codes, are an infegral 
part of the secular, religious and socio-political 
systems. 

Some of the art objects include a "one-of-a-kind" 
Fijian necklace from England, an extremely rare 
Tongan female deity, feather ca pes and cloak, a very 
rare Tapa Easter Island figure, and, of course, excellent 
examples of "tikis," household items, jewelry, and 
other everyday necessities. 

Some of the Gauguin's included are : " Words of the 
Devil" (National Gallery, Washington, D.C.), " Women 
and the White Horse" (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), 
"Parahi Te Marae" (Fogg), and "Tahitian landscape" 
(Metrolopitan Museum of Art) and several woodcuts 
and rare scul pture showing Marquesan influence. 
Examples of La Farge's work include " Maua, Our

This excellent debut album is from 
one of the first of waht will surely be 
many southern bands to capitalize on 
the super-success of the Allman 
Brothers Band. The soun d is definitely 
reminiscent of the first Allmans lP, a 
record rough around the aesthetic 
edges but strong on promise. 

lynyrd Skynyrd is a sextext featuring 
three, count 'em, three quitaritst 
capable of lead play. Their primary 
weakness is the typical malady of most 
young bands, that being basically 
immature material. 

Their writers do a good job of 
avoiding the pretentious lyrics 
associated with most young songwriters, 
in fact , the album as a whole is quite 
listenable and two cuts of the eight on 
the lP are standouts. These are the 
open ing cut, I Ain 't the One and 
Mississippi Kid. Tile latter of these is an 
excellent contemporary country blues 
co-authored by two of the band 
members and their producer AI Kooper. 

Kooper considers the talent market in 
the South to be so great that he's 
established permanent residence in

promotion of Southern acts. 

So get ready one and all for the big 
rush of new Southern product. We've 
already seen Wet Willie and The 
Marshall Tucker Band and now Lynyrd 
Skynyrd; more surely are soon to follow. 

It's worthy of mention that these first 
thre Southe rn rock bands of the post-

average talent. There "is" a Southern

GEORGE BENSON 
BODY TALK: CTI 6033 - Dance; 

When Love has Grown; Plum; Body 
T~lk; Topofthe World. 

Taken simply on its own merit, Body 
T~lk is enjoyable listening. Benson's 
guitar solos develop here from somEfof 
the most interesting rhythm patterns 
he's ever used and his playing is typically 
flawless . This album though represents a 
further commercialization of style not 
unlike the musical tran si ton 
experienced by the late Wes 
Montgomery. Montgomery, as his 
career progressed and his popularity 
grew, recorded more and more 
commercialized guitar instrumentals. 

Benson's style fortunately does allow 
for commercial exploitation without 
completely sacrificing his long-term 
public. I am personally disappointed by 
this ·album becausp I con~idered h is two 
earlier ell albums, Beyond the Blue 
Horizon and White R~bbil to be classic 
instances of contemporary jazz guitar. 

Body Talk, while a good album, 
remains something less that its 
predecessors. Its production (Creed 
Taylorl and engineering (Van Belder) are 
of the extremely fine quality found on 
all CTI releases. The " production work" 
(mainly horn fills) is kept at a minimum 
and never gets in Benson's way. 

Body Tillie then, is good but subdued. 
If George Benson follows the caissie 
pattern eluded to earlier then expect 
more lush production with each 
successive release. I hope my intuition 
here is inco rrect. 

If you want a well produced, pleasant 
jazz guitar album then Body Talk is for 
you. If though, you're unfamiliar with 
the Blue Horizon and White Rilbbit LPs, 
Benson bqins there .

Birdi Fly As Coed 
Badmintoners Meet 

It appears that all of you 
volleyball devotees may 
have to wait for the courts 
in the gym this year as the 
nets are finally going up for 
the all new women'slcoed 
badminton team. 
Organized by (you guessed 
it!) the San Diego Women's 
Intercollegiate Board, this 
badminton league is also a 
first for the city of San 
Diego. The rivals of UCSD 
are local junior colleges 
Mesa, Grossmont, South-
western. 

Although badminton 
season usually begins in 
February, the birdies will 
be flying for the first com-
petition October 13, 9:00 
am, at the Grossmont 
Invitational Tournament. 
For those of you spectators 
who find it difficult to cra",1 
out of bed at such a dread-
ful hour, the first league 
game places the Tritons up 
against Grossmont on 
home ground at 4:00, Oct. 

18. With the final SDWIB 
tournament December 1, 
you can watch or parti-
cipate in the two big 
tourneys and six action-
packed league games 
which will determine the 
victors. 

After viewing the first 
practice, it is apparent that 
this team is going to burn 
up the gym floor out of 
pure enthusiasm. However, 
don't let this intimidate 
those of your who have any 
inkling of an aspiration to 
join up. Coach Judy Sweet 
is looking for many more 
recruits - especially you 
talented women. Students 
are needed to play 
women's singles and 
doubles, men 's singles or 
doubles , and mixed 
doubles. 

Practise hours are 
Monday and Wednesday 
from 4:00 to 5:30 until 

October 14, aher which 
these badminton 
enthusiasts will take over 
the gym from 6:30 to 8:00. 
So, don't sit there glumly at 
your desks I Contact Judy 
Sweet or bop on over to 
the gym and have yourself 
a good time. 

Winter Baseball

72-22-53 HIKEI 
Intramural Flag Football has 
officially begun, and this 
year it's bigger than ever. 
Due to the rise in participa-
tion, a fifth league had to 
be added to accomodate 
the 45 men's teams and 3S 
coed teams. 

These teams, ranging in 
talent from bang-up to 
lame, are organized by 
students wanting to get out 
there and go wild on the 
field . But before they even 
line up, the team members 
are given a chance to 
express themselves in their 
team name. Some choose 
suggestive 
double/entendres, while 
others adopt a name to 
identify their worthy 
captain (case in point: The 
BABOONS). 

Sharing the spotlight this 
fall in the men's toughest 
league are OFF, OVER THE 
HILL GANG, BABOONS 
and STUMBLERS; while the 
two favoured coed teams 
are KAMANAWANALAYA 
and CONTACT 
INHIBITION. For what it's 
worth, UCSD has the 
" honor" this season of 
sporting its first all redhead 
coed fea m. 

Since there will be only 

three or four returning 
referees this fall, 
teammates are requested 
to have a little patience 
with the new officials. 

An effective rule 
established last year 
stipulates that only the 
team captains are allowed 
to talk with the refs 
regarding misunder-
standings and complaints. 
Any violation of this rule 
will cost the team a 12 yard 
penalty. A great deal of 
unnecessary bitching to the 
ref is eliminated in this way. 

To get the latest scoop on 
your team and its rivals, 
check out the JOCK STRIP. _ 

This weekly Intramural 
newspaper contains the 
latests standings and game 
write-ips . Of course, 
anyone is welcome to write 
a story for the STRIP is he or 
she feels a team is not 
properly recognized for 
any due honor of glory. 

The 1M football program 
is directed toward 
promoting fun and friendly 
competition (no blood and 
guts). And, as most 
seasoned players can tell 
you, during Fall quarter, 
the football field is the best 
place on campus to meet 
physical people. 

Sexual Interplay Present 
Highlighting the first 

weekend of intramural 
football were the highly 
entertaining coed battles. 
For those' of you who 
believe you know the 
fundamentals of football, 
come out and see them 
totally destroyed. 

In a game between the 
Chargers and Plutz 's 
Klutzes, first blood was 
drawn when Kay Davis, 
sweeping left end, streaked 
by Sports Editor Eric 
Raisters for the game's first 
score. This touchdown 
proved to b the only one 
the Klutzes actually 
needed. 

In a game of blood and 
guts such as football, it 
seemed that the Chargers 
spent more time preparing 
their jerseys than 
themselves. , 

Quarterback Rod (Archie 
Manning) Moore and his 
cannon arm were enough 
to keep the Chargers out of 
the contest. And at the rare 
moments when Moore was 
on target, the girls seemed 
to be thinking of last nights 
affair rather than 6 points. 
At the end of the half the 
Chargoers made a move for 
the endzone only to be 
halted by their fine QB 
Moore, tossing passes that 
appeared to be punts. 

Disgusted Dric Raisters 

By Larry Baldwin 
hobbled by injuries , as 
usual, appeared to be 
astoundingly ineffective in 
the defensive backfield 
until he surprised us by 
saying he was playing de-
fensive line. The con sensus 
opinion of the Chargoers 
was that zebra Gordon 
Akers was DOGMEAT. 

The stars for Klutzes 
Klutzes were running back 
Kay Davis, who scored all 
three touchdowns, and 

q~arterback Keith Bryan 
who threw some crushing 
blocks. The culmination of 
the excitement was when · 
Eric Raisters walked off the 
field, in submission, with 10 
minutes to play. 

In another coed battle 
the New Orleans Saints 
took on the Retords. This 
game was highlighted by 
interceptions as neither 
team could generate any 
offense. 

The Saints took the early 
lead on an interception by 
Tim Luey, who ran it back 
40 yards for 6 points. The 
point failed as Ron Werft 's ' 
job in the cafeteria caught-
up with him; he snagged 
the ball out of the 
endzone. 

The Saint offense was run 
by a dainty young coed 
named Gillette. She is 
supported by the majority 
of the UCSD tennis team, 

man and woman alike, not 
to mention a pair of Chuck 
Millenbah 's volley bailers. 

Sue Papenek showed 
that having hands for 
setting does not go hand in 
hand with catching a foot -
ball. 

The game also was spiced 
by a small oriental fellow, 
who told me not to use his 
name, howling instructions 
towards referre John 
Roudebush who thought 
he was doing a good job. 

In a last ditch effort to 
move the offense Claudia 
S. replaced John at quarter-
back. Shevthen tossed a 

,touchdown pass to Lynn 
Peachee of the Retords. 
Upon realizing whom she 
had thrown the passs to, 
she labeled Mr. Peachee a 
fruit. The score when time 
elapsed was 6-6. 

A tiebreaker consisting 
of 8 plays was then used to 
determine the winner. The 
Retords grabbed the 
victory, after a last pass by 
the Saints was dropped by 
Ron Werft, who saw 
victory in his grasp and ob-
viously didn't want any part 
of it. Mr. Werh said after 
the game : "They obviously 
knew who the star was and 
double teamed him ." Ron 
should stick to basket-
ball.

it be possible to extend this

Referendum 
Editor: 

With all the cu rrent 
controversy about 
Governor Reagan 's tax 
initiative, I'd like to add 
another point of view to 
your editorial and Mr. 
Donald Gray's response in 
last Friday's 9/28 edition of 
th e Triton Times. 

We know that income tax 
would effectively be 
reduced 7.5%. Would we 
be blessed with such a 
situation Mr. Gray and 
many other politicians have 
ascerted that sales and 
property taxes would risel 
(It is most probable that 
when commercials 
oppossing the measure are 
released, this point will be 
heavily emphazied). 
However Mr. Gray and 

Article two(2) , section 
seven(7) of the United 
States Constitution gives 
the House of Represen-
tatives the exclusive and 
sole right of formulating tax 
bills. The California State 
Constitution (incidently the 
longest of any other State 
or City in the Country and 
probably the world) also is 
patterned much in the 
same way . All tax and 
appropriations bills and 
measures must originate in 
the State Assembly. 

With this information in 
mind we can easlily see that 
taxes just do not rise by 
themselves or ovem;p.tI 
An Assemblyman or group 
of Assemblymen would 
have to introduce a bill that 
would effectively raise sales 
and property tax . And with 
the current consensus of 
the tax situation in this 
State at present, it is highly 
probable that a good 
percentage of active voting 
Californians ' would 
remember the Assembly-
man or Assemblymen who 
initiated and passed 
another effective tax bill . 

Stupendous in that 
bureau's, inefficacious 
program's, and needless 
spending would all come to 
a halt. California man could 
stop worrying about the 
constant rise in 
government spending and 
with it- his taxes. The cut 
would be detrimental in 
that some important public 
services would be cut, as 
well as other programs and 
services listed by Mr. Gray 
in last Friday's issue. 

The Reagan tax limitation 
measure clearly has points 
which will be of an 
advantage to some and to 
the disadvantage of others. 
However overall the tax 
limitation measure will 
benefit the average 
homeowner more than any 
other class of people. His 
income and property taxes 
will be substantially 
reduced. Whereas the 
measure at the same time 
will cut programs that are 

Polynesian Art Exhibi t 
. _ Continued from Page 4 

Boatman" (Addison Gallery of American Art) and 
"Tulafales-Speechmaking" (Kennedy Galleries) . 

Traditional Polynesian art of the period covered by 
the show is limited in supply, Miss Teilhet said. Some 
islands have preserved very little of their culture and 
others did not produce much art. 
. "To my knowledge, the two ivory and wood Tongan 

figures are among only 13 Tongan pieces in existence," 
she said. "Tahitian art, represented by several rare fly 
whisk handles, is almost nonexistent. The feather capes 
and leis from the Ha,waiian Islands, Samoa and New 
Zealand are also scarce because of their great 
delicacy," she said. 

In conjunction with the exhibition, Miss leilhet and 
her students have prepared a comprehensive, 2S0-page 
catalog of Polynesian art. Utilizing pieces in the show 
and other representative works, the book bill cover the 
socio-political and religious role of art in the 
Polynesian culture and will be a basic text Qn the 
subject. - . 

More than a year of preparation has gone into the 
show beginning with a PolyneSian seminar at UCSD in 
the spring of 1972. Miss Teilhet and her students in the 
class obtained grants to support their work from the 
National Endowment for the Arts and the Kress 
Foundation as well as assistance from UCSD. 

But overall we should 
consider how this 
proposed ammendment if 
passed would affect us in 
the future. Tuiton raises 
should not be the only ' 
criteria used ind deciding 
which way we cast our 
vote. Income and property 
taxes will eventually 
become a part of our 
financial lives if they 
haven't already . This is an 
important consideration, 
yet every person should 
vote in accordance of how 
the initiative will affect 
himself.
