that she understOod unmarked

Although Muir Assistant

Effects of Prop 9 Detailed 
Question Much The Same As In Previous Tax-Cutting 

BY BOB £GELKO 
"-iated Pre .. Writer 

SACRAMENTO - Cal-
ofninia voters will be served a 
third helping of tax cuts on 
their June 3 election plate. 

They wiD decide whether 
the property tax cull of 1978 
and the government spending 
timit. of last year satisfied their 
hunger or only whetted their 
a~titea. 

'The featured jtem on the 
menu is Proposition 9, 
Howard Jarvia' proposal to cut 
Itate income tax ratea in half. 

of its total - once it took full 
effect, and distribute about 
$3.4 biUion to state tax-
payers, with the rest going to 
the federal government in 
higher income tax payments. 

A family of four making 
$20,000 a year, and itemizing 
its tax deduction , would have 
its $233 state income tax biU 
cut by $156 and pay $33 
more in federal income taxes 
on the average, according to a 
legislative staff analysis of the 
measure. 

The cuts are higher for 

11 Initiatives Facing 
Voters: What They Say 

Here i. a tist of .tatewide ballot measures in the June 3 
election: • 

.Proposition 1 - Would authorize $495 miltion in general 
obligation honda to finance park and coaatalland acquisition, 
fisheries and water conservation. 

.Proposition 2 ~ Would authorize $750 million in Cal·Vet 
bonds for farm and home loans to veterans. 

.Proposition 3 - Would restrict future alteration of historic 
. portion. of the state CapitoL 

.Proposition 4 - Would eliminate the requirement of local 
voter approval before Iow·income housing can be built, 
instead allowing opponents to block the project by circulating 
petitions for a referendum. 

• Proposition 5 - Would write into the state constitution 
the shield law allowing reporters to keep their sources and 
Wlpubli.hed information confidential. 

.Proposition 6 - Would set standards for the Legislature 
to reapportion its districts, including reasonable adherence to 
city and county lines. 

.Proposition 7 - Would allow debris from a disaster to be 
removed from private property at state expense. 

• Proposition 8 - Would let the Legislature offer revenue 
bonds to finance the acquisition, construction or installation of 
facilities using solar power or other alternative energy 
sources. 

.Proposition 9 - Would cut stale income tax rates in half 
and provide for permanent annual upward adjustment of tax 
brackell for innation and a ban on business inventory taxes. 

.Proposition 10 - Would ban .tatewide rent control, 
repeal current local rent ordinances in November and require . 
any future rent control laws to allow annual cost-of -living rent 
increases and exempt new and vacated rental units . 

.Proposition 11 - Would impose a 10 percent tax on the 
profits of oil companies with $5 million or more worldwide 
income , the revenue to be used for mass transit and 
development of alternative transportation fuels . 

Also among the 11 ballot 
measures are Proposition 10, 
a landlord· backed proposal to 
restrict local rent control, and 
Proposition 11 , a 1 0 percent 
tax on the profill of major oil 
companies to fund mass 
transit. 

Voters also will decide on a 
strengthened shield law, letting 
reporters keep their sources 
confidential, and on a $495 
milbon bond issue for parks 
and conservation projects. 

PropositiOn 9 would cost 
elate government about $4.4 
billion in revenues for a 
calendar year - ahout III fifth 

'larger incomes - a $671 net 
reduction at $50,000, for 
example, and $1,671 at 
$100,000 - while families 
making below $10,000 would 
gain nothing because they pay 
no state income taxes now . 

But for the average tax· 
payer, the quesJion is the same 
as it has been for the last three 
years: Should I vote for 
perhaps an extra $100 or 
$200 to help pay for groceries 
and gas, and trust that I won't 
end up paying more in higher 
local government fees and 
lower services? 

That question has been 

answered with a resounding 
"yes" twice, with the 2.1 
passage of Jarvis' Proposition 
13, a $7 billion property tax 
cut, in June 1978 , and the 
nearly 3 · 1 approval last 
November of Paul Gann's 
Proposition 4 , which put 
spending limits on state and 
local governments, eventually 
requiring more tax cuts. 

The deep c uts In 
government programs that 
were widely forecast if 
Proposition 13 passed didn't 
occur, largely because the 
state used its innation·swollen 
budget surplus to bailout local 
governments. 

That used up some of the 
surplus, and though state 
offic~ are predi~ a $2.6 
billion surplus for June 30, 
they say Proposition 9 will 
force program cuts - perilaps 
modest the first year, but 
substantial the second year. 

Opponenll say they've 
learned something from 
Proposi tion 13' s over· 
whelming victory: the public 
doesn't believe "doomsday" 
warnings, especially by 
government offici als . 

This time the strategy of 
labor groups leading the 
opposition includes recruiting 
former Jarvis backers, like.Los 
Angeles City Controller Ira 
Reiner, and emphasizing the 
argument that the measure is 
an unfair windfall for the rich . 

That approach was 
exemplified by Gov. Edmund 
Brown Jr .'5 March 20 
televised speech in which he 
used a chart showing 10 
percent of the Proposition 9 
benefits, and declared, "I 
believe that it is unfair to -give 
so much money to so few. " 

Jarvis has his own charts , 
showing the highest 
percentage tax cuts going to 
those in the $10,000- to 
$20,000·a·year brackets , and 
stresses the benefits his 
measure holds for "the averge 
wage earner." He also 
contends a tax cut will 
stimulate the economy and 
create jobs . 

From public reaction to the 
campaign so far, it appears 
that support for the income tax 
cut, though broad, may not be 
as deep as the grounds well for 
the property tax reductions of 
Proposition 13. 

Propositions 10 and I I are

The Life You Save

May Be ·A ·Snail's 
BY KEirn GRANT·DAVIE . 

11\ th<! Winter Quarter it was whale.watching: Now thatlhe.. 
rains are almost over, there may be few more chances in 
1980 to snail-watch. Both pastimes call for patience beyond 
the normal call of duty. With the whales, you wait for a brief 
spout or flash of nukes, but with snails there's no problem in 
seeing them - it's a question of waiting for them to do 
something. They're not known to be hasty animals , but at 
times the seem to have a stoic disregard for their own safety. 

Keith Grant·Davie is a Graduate student in American 
Literature, here on exchange from Exeter University, 
England. 

Take the Genesee snails, for instance . On a wet day, you 
can see several hundred of them 'doing the stroll' on the 
sidewalk by University Towne Centre. They pour out from 
the rubbery safety of the sea-fig bank and surf sedately across 
the wet paving, apparently heading for the road and a rubbery 
death . 

Why they should make this pilgrimage is a mystery to me . 
Possibly , as native Californians, they have a taste for 
waterbed5 and find the slippery surface a good place to make 
more snails. Tired of a secret life among plants , it might occur 
to them "Why don't we do it in the road?" Comfortable as 
they may be, the sidewalk and the road are not reputed to be 
safe places for anything, least of all lovemaking . The 
shattered cases that lie on the path at every few paces , 
crushed like taco chips on blobs of dark refritos, are witnesses 
to the fact that the liberal sprinkling of snails tums the place 

Into a min e fi e ld for 
pedestrians. 

I try to tread carefully, but 
on stormy nights, fumbling for 
my door keys , with my mind 
on other things, I confess I 
have sometimes heard the 
fatal crunch underfoot and 
winced, in vain - mending a 
mollusc has to be the ultimate 
lost cause. 

Why do they hang out in the 
really dangerou., places? 
Apart from the road, two of 
their favorite dying spots are 

the doorstep and doormat, the latter being paticularly 
annoying, for reasons which should be obvious. I don't mean 
to knock snails. I've always had a soft spot for them, but I 
prefer them above ground level ; like high up on the window, 
parked and sleeping it off, the morning after a storm, with a 
tittle faecal offering coiled nearby as proof of occupancy. 

They never seem to stay long in one place before sliding on 
down the road, combining the American dreams of home 
ownership and perpetual travel. With a camper shell on the 
back, CB antennae on the front, a poai-traction tread beneath 
you and no gas problems, what more could you want? O.K., 
it may be a bit slow, but then speed is relative: anyone who 
has crossed the Mojave desert at 55 m.p.h. can teU you it feels 
no faster than oozing across the lawn on a sticky foot. 

They don't make suitable pets, despite some advantages 
like costing nothing, being easy to pick up, bringing you 

. serenity of the mind if you' have the patience to watch them, 
and being infinitely more fun than pet rock •. What disqualifies 
a;nails is that you can't train them, they have no visible 
affections, and they're as blind, deaf and dumb as the Pinball 
Wizard. . • • 

All in all, though, the snail is worth a closer look. If you're· 
into aerobic dance or Venus ny·traps , a mere monopod "1ay. 
hold tittle charm; but even so, next time it rains. do watch your 
Itep. Remember, under every dark cloud is a snail with a 

. 's~very lining ...

Terrorists· Hold Iran's 
Embas'sy in London 

LONOON - Three "Arab 
power" militanll took over the 
Iranian Embassy on a quiet 
London back street yesterday 
and threatened to kiU their 20 
hostages unle.s Ayatollah 
Ruhollah Khomeini 's regime 
frees 91 political prisoners 
held in Iran'. Arab·populated 
oil belt . 

If the Tehran government 
does not meet their demand by 
noon today. the gunmen said, 
they will blow up the building. 

The three terrorists , 
reportedly armed with 
submachine guns or carbines, 
identified themselves as Arabs 
from Khuzestan who support 
autonomy for that region of 
lOuthwest Iran. 

The British Broadcasting 
Corp., which received the 
ultimatum in a telephone call 
from the embassy, said the 
gunmen reported one of their 
hostages had been wounded 
and they wanted a doctor. The 
victim was not identified. 

Witnesses had said they 
.heard gunfire as the terrorists 
forced their way into the 
building at 6:30 am EDT. 

The only other casualty 
reported was a woman captive 
who was released in late 
afternoon suffering from wh~t 

~Iice said was severe shock. 
She was carried out on a 
stretcher and rushed off by 
ambulance. 

Police said her release left 
20 hostagel, including a 
British police guard. The top 
Iranian diplomat in London, 
Charge d'Affaires Gholan-Ali 
Afrouz, also was reported 
among those held captive. 

The BBC said the terrorists 
also demanded a safe flight out 
of Britain for themselves and 
their hostages . 

Police later confinned the 
gunmen's demands were 
similar to those reported by the 
BBe. .

Mafia' s Tactics 
Still Old fashion 

WASHINGTON - The 
FBI says Mafia bosses use 
computers to run their 
businesses these days , but still 
rely on the old·fashioned 
tactics of fear, intimidation 
and murder to muscle into 
them. 

"Murder is essential for their 
operations," James Nelson, an 
FBI organized crime 
specialist, told the Senate 
permanent investigations 
subcommittee Tuesday. 

The committee was to 
examine a specific case in 
detail today-the Kansas City 
mob's attempt in the mid· 
1970s to seize control of a 
business redevelopment 
project known as the River 
Quay. 

Nelson and two other FBI 
officials-Oscar Revell, a 
deputy assistant director, and 
Sean McWeeney, chief of the 
organized crime section-
described current operations 
of the syndicate popularly . 
known as the Mafia, but called 
La Cos a Nostra by its 
members. 

Cancer Linked to 
'53 Atomic' Test 

LA MESA - The 
Veterans Administration said 
yesterday it will check to see 
whether former Marine 
photographer Malcolm 
Miller 's lung cancer is 
connected with a 1953 atomic 
test at Yucca flail, Nev. 

The detonation of a 23-
kiloton device atop a 3oo·foot 
tower was photographed as far 
away as Los Angeles, 280 
miles from the blast. Miller and 
another Marine photographer, 
Roy Olund, were stationed 
eight miles away. 

In routine field uniforms and 
wearing special badges that 
changed color with radio· 
activity, Miller and Olund 
went into the test area the next 
day. They took pictures of the 
effect of the blast on marine 
equipment as close as 500 
yards from ground zero.

and Job Fair, contending that 
their presence on campus was 
"offensive to the students 01

introduced a motion approved 
by the Council to "urge Career

similar to the alcohol and 
tobacco taxes. 

In a poD conducted by 
Mervin FJeld in April 1979, it 
was found that more than 
three million adults in 
California use marijuana 
regularly at lea.t one or twice a 
week. Over seven million 
people have used it at least 
once. 

But because the use of 
marijuana i. widespread, the 
sense of urgency in changing 
the law hal gready diminished. 

Paoli contended. "The 
activists have abandoned 
activism ," he said. "The 
idealism of 1972 is gone and 
we're now faced ~ith

'Artificial Kidneys Supplanting Tedious Dialysis 
UCSD-Designed Filter Catching On Faster Abroad 

BY PAUL DENT 
Life i. looking up for the 

many . kidney failure patients 
around the world, 8J a UCSD 
deligned and developed 
aritificial kidney Ihows a great 
leap in patient safety and 
comfort over older, more 
popular methods. 
- ihe hemo61tration device, 
AI it i. called, WAI developed 
by Lee HenderIOll, a UCSD 
profeilOt' and phy.ician in 
residence at the V A Hospital. 

"1be Iy.tem hal evolved to 
the point where it is virtually 
fail'lafe," Henderson says 
optimistically. The device hal 
been perfected to such a point 
that, he says, several foreign 
countries have begun 
production of self·contained, 
working model •. 

"In the Orient, and 
particularly Japan, there has 

been great enthusiasm," he 
says, adding that both France 
and Germany have had great 
IUCcell with production. 

Although technology for the 
device is growing rapidly in the 
US, Henderson says 
researchers here have been 
"sluggish" in implementing the 
new designll on a large scale. 

One of the German 
manufacturing firms, SatoriUl, 
hal employed extensive use of 
rnicroprocellors in order to 
improve the system's patient 
blood pressure monitoring 
capabi~ties, always a problem 
with artificial kidney 
treatment. 

Henderson explains that the 
UCSD device drawl plasma 
through a highly apecilic filter 
which removes all but the 
smallest particles of waste. He 
likens the technique to pouring 

presented In conjunction 
with Cinco de Mayo 

free light and dark 
(sorry, no milk and cookies) 

dirty water through a watering 
can spout, only the smaller 
molecules can pass through 
the "holes". 

In the past, the cruder, 
larger and more uncomfor-
table hemodialysis machine 
has been used to treat kidney 
failure patients. Henderson 
compared this process, which 
diffuses "clean" plasma 
through a membrane, to the 
action of a tea bag in hot 
water. The technique was 
"effective, but tedious," he 
says . 

About the size of a small 
refrigerator, the hemofiltration 
system's crucial part is a thin, 
eight inch long filter. The filter, 
although small, is effective 
enough that one provides 
filtration for the large 

aq~arium in Henderson's 
offICe. 

Inside the filter sits a 
specially designed material 
capable of holding back 
molecules up to half the size of 
a common enzyme. Such 
selectivity virtually insures 
that no dangerous amounts of 
blood-poisoning matter will be 
returned to the bloodstream 
from the machine, he says. 

UCSD'. IOphist:icated hemofiltration "artificial kidney" ia no 
..... er than a unall refriRerator, yet it mark. a vast improvement 
over previously u.ed methoda. 1be two white tube. at bottom 
right are the crucial filter. in the system. 

Another improvement over 
the antiquated hemodialysis 
machine is the new device's 
ability to work with a patient's 
system. Patients are only 
required to be on the machine 
for four hours, three limes a 
week, and in the interim, they 
can function at near-normal 
levels. Also, side effects, such 
aa cramps, l nausea and 
dizziness have been drastically 
reduced in the new system. 

Henderson is one of the few 
researchers who got in on the 
.. ground floor" of artificial 
kidney research, as he studied 
with some of the pioneers of 
the field. 

While studying medicine at 
the University of Pennsyl. 
vania, Henderson was 
influenced by Dr. Lewis 
Bruenle, a rare man in his time 
who would now be considered 
a bioengineer. He steered 
Henderson in the direction of 
research, a goal he never 
abandoned while undertakiny

he brought with him a 
prototype of a device that 
would someday develop into

Kofff arrived at Peter B. 
Brigham Hospital in Boston 
while Henderson was 
completing his clinical training 
there, and the two began to 
work together on the "rotating 
drum" device. That machine 
was developed to a point

W hen the hair cut was over with, the kitchen 

floor was deep in 
black curls. Jake exhaled 
loudly, relieved he could 
resume normal breathing. 

"Smooth," he said, rubbing 
his skull with hia fingertips, 
"thia is reaaJHI smooth." As he 
kept rubbing, his fingertips 
massaged his scalp and dug 
in to the skin under the hair. 

Jessica smiled and noticed 
that a small, dull ache was 
thrQbbing in her joints. She put 
the scissors on the table, and 
folded her hands together, as 
though to offer a prayer, and 
then flipped the folded fingers 
over until her palms faced the 
floor. 

The Daily- Guardian 

Arts 
Eyes closed and mouth taut, 

she bent the fingers until the 
knuckles cracked in unison, 
the sound of it filMg her ears 
like hiking boots tromping wet 
twigs. She sighed without a 
sound. 

"Let's have a look see," said 
Jake. His fingernails had 
gathered dirt from the oily 
scalp. Jessica handed him a 
hand mirror as he was about 
to bite the nail off his left 
pinky. He took the mirror and 
held it close to his face , being 
unable to see it otherwise 
because his llIasses were on 
the table. The lenses were 
smeared with a waxy coating 
of grease and congealed 
sweat. 

"Ahhhhh ha," hummed 
Jake, his tone almost musical. 
"This is the face, and this, yes 
this, is the head ofllair it calls 
for." He ran his left palm over 
the new hair cut and marvelled 
at the look and touch. Looks 
and feels like the bristles of a 
soft brush, he thought. 

Jessica picked up the 
glasses, with their priestly 
wire-rim frames, and was 
blowing hot breath on the 
lenses before she plucked a 
tissue from a Kleenex box to 
wipe the glass clean. Then she 

walked up behind the chair 
where Jake was slumped, and 
perched the frame on his 
nose. Jake adjusted the fit and 
turned around to look at her. 

"Now look at yourself," she 
said, pointing to the mirror 
now in his lap. "Take a look at 
what you really look like. " 

Jake held the mirror up 
again. 

"Hey shit," he said, " I look 
like Samual Beckett." He 
squinted his eyes and looked 
up to the ceiling, trring to 
simulate a photo he d seen 
years ago of Beckett poring 
over strip of movie film with a 
magnifying glass, glasses on, 
hair shorl. . 

"More like John Lennon," 
said Jessica. She had pulled a 
broom from the comer and 
was sweeping up the severed 
locks into one big pile. 

"John Lennon? With hair 
this short?" 

"Yeah. You're the rock 
critic. Think. Remember that 
film he was in? For Richard 
Lester?" 

Jake scratched his skull and 
felt a growing itch. Dandruff, 
he thought. "Help? Hard 
Day 's Night? No, he had long 
hair in both of those ... " The 
itching spread into a large ring 
on the crown of his skull. 

J essiea pulled a dust pan from under the 
table and pushed the 

hair into it with one stroke of 
the broom. "Not a Beatie 
movie. It was How I Won The 
War, where Lennon played a 
British soldier and he had to 
get a close crop for the part . 
Shorter than that." 

She pointed at Jake', hair 
cut, which he was ravaging 
with both hands, scratching 
the scalp desperately until the 
fingernails cut the scalp. The 
air around Jake's head and 
shoulders was a limited snow 
flurry. 

Jake pulled himself out of 
the chair, brushing hair and 
flakes from his shoulders and 
naked chest, and then raised 
hi. arms to stretch and yawn. 
He tilted his head to ,meIl his 
armpit and fro~ when he 
was greeted by something that 
smelled like a mineral beth. 

"Have it your way," he 
said, "I look like LelUlOn. I still 
like being Beckett better." 

Jessica, screwing on an 
attachment to the hose of a 
vacuum cleaner, shook her 
head. "Better go take a 
shower ," she said, "you don't 
know your own strength." 
Before she could punch the 
foot button to turn on the 
machine, the doorbell out front 

ran~three times.

"I know the ring anywhere," 

she said. "You guys going to

'Soak the Oil Companies,' 
Backers of Prop 11 Cry 

BY BOB EGELKO 
Auocia ........... Wri60r 

SACRAMENTO - The Proposi-
tion 11 oil lax campaign i. being fought 
over symbolic demons: one side is 
warring again.t the "pigs" of bi¥ oil, the 
other against the "bumblers' of big 
government. 

Bill Press, Gov. Edmund Brown 
Jr.'s former aide who is sponsoring the 
June 3 ballot measure, portrays the 10 
percent surlax on oil companies to fund 
mass transit as a chance for the public 
to strike back at big oil. 

' 'The public is stiD outraged over 
higher oil profits," Press said in a recent 
interview. "Our strategy is to focus on 
the oil companies, their profits, prices 
people are paying at the pumps, and 
make Proposition 11 a referendum on 
bi oil." 

'Yo that end, commercials he hopes 
to air later this month .how pigs at a 
trough while oil company profill are 
f1a.hed on the screen - some of them 
more that double last .year' s profits. 

The multimimon-dollar o~ company-
financed opposition campaign scarcely 
mentions the word oil. 

Instead, Proposition 11 is portrayed 
as a tax on farms and railroads, hurting 
the economy and de.troyins jobs, and 
administered by the slate ''bumblers.'' 

"We have to offset the promoler of 
thi. thing who .ay. it taxes only the big 
oil companies," said Jack McDowell, 
whose San Francisco public relation. 
fim, is h.ilndling the No·on-Il 
eamp8iSri. "That simpl~ true." - ,

sity !lfi~ .side is compleliely right:

not exclusively, to oil cOmpanies. 

- It might affect a few farms but 

probably wouldn't cover any railroads. 
- It would he easy to calculate bod 

could have some .atpeClI that arr

The 10 percent lax, which would be 
in addition to the slale'. 9.6 percent 
corporation lax, would apply to any 
company with more than $5 miIion in 
wQrldwide earning. and more than half 
ill business in energy. P~ic utilities 
would be exempted. 

Franchise Tax Board research 
direclor AUan Desin said 54 lax 
returns fitting that description were 
filed with the board in 1978, aU by oil 
companies. 

The tax revenue would be used for 
local bus and train .ystems and for 
development of alternative 
transportation fuel •. Various eatimab!l 
place the annual revenue at $200 to 
$400 million It year, dependiRl on oil 
prices, use, production and profits.

Cal Poly Responds to Jarvis 
SAN LUIS OBISPO -

Critical reaction mounted 
yesterday to .tatements by 
crusty tax fighter Howard 
Jarvis published by the Cal 
Poly, San Luil Obispo , 
Iludenf newlpaper that the 
county government was 
"crooked" and that Cal Poly 
didn't offer Itudent. an 
education. 

In the Dailll Mustang 
interview, publilhed lalt week, 
Jarvis attacked goverMleIlt in 
the county, though it was not 
completely dear whether he 

City, University React to Tax 
was referring to the county 
exclusively, to the city 01 San 
Luis Obi.po, or both. 

"God, if you want to see a 
lousy county, it's San Luil 
Obispo," Jarvil .aid. "That's 
the dumbest, crookedelt 
bunch ... in the whole county 
(Iic). 

"I went there one time and I 
tried to find out what their 
bonded indebtedne •• was," he 
continued. "There waln't a 
100 of a bitch in the city of San 
Luil Obispo that knew." 

Jarvi. .aid I"at when the 

records were found, they were 
in a shoe box . 

Interviewer Andrew Jowers 
asked Jarvis about statements 
by University of California 
President David Saxon that 
tuition would probably have to 
be charged students if 
Proposition 9 passes. 

Jower. laid that if tuition 
were charged, 100,000 
students' would be forced to 
drop out. 

Jarvis replied, "I wish there 
would be that many dropouts, 
and especially a lot from 

Assentbly Delays Christian 
Relief On Adults Only SAN BERNARDINO -

Rick Painter has been accused 
of "pro.tituting Chriltianity" 
because he runs beer 
commercials during the 
Dodger games and plays 
songs by atheists on his 
reHsious radio station. 

SACRAMENTO 
Legislation backed by the real 
eltate indultry" to permit 
adults-only aparbnents had 
been .hunted aside for pollible 
further .tudy. 

1he action yesterday ended 
the bi~'. competition against a 
rival bill by a Loa Angeles 
Democrat that would prohibit 
landlords from di.criminating 
on the basi. of age. 

The adults· only bill i. 
AB3409 by Asaemblyman 
Walter I"lall., D-Riveraide. It 
was sent to interim .tudy 

~terday by the A.sembly 
Houling and Community 
Development Committee. 
Thil i. a maneuver which 
technically leaves the bin alive, 
but keeps it from advancing 
for the rest of the year. 

Specifically, the bill would 
allow apartment owners to 
cater to lpecific age groupl by 
creating "a particular 
atmosphere or pervading 
social influence or environ-
ment." 

The rival age-dilcrimina-
tion bill is SB 2024 by Sen. 
David Roberti, D·Los 
Angeles. It doesn't mention 
children, but neverthelell 
meanl that landlords would 
have 10 rent to tenants with 
children. 

Roberti's bill is now on the 
Senate floor. But the Senate 
earlier defeated a Roberti bill 
to prohibit discrimination 
againlt len ants with children. 
with children spelled out in the 
lext. 

But Painter, 26, on hil first 
job as a radio station 
programmer, says he's raised 
the radio ltation's audience 
from "abysmal levels" to 
compete with the rock ltations 
that crowd the dial in 
Riverside. 

Recycle This Newsp~per 

"We do make this stand, 
that if it's not contrary to 
orthodox Christianity, we1l 
put it on," he said. For 
instance, Painter said he 
would not play former Beatle 

G~ Harrison I My Sweet 
Lord,' about his Krishna 
beliefs.

"You're inferring that if you 
go to Cal Poly you'll get an 
education," Jarvis continued. 
"I don't believe it because they 
don't give you one. They give 
you a bunch of garbage." 

Jarvis broadened his 
criticism to take in the state 
school system. 

"It's not an educational 

system any more," he said. 
'It'l political Malia for money. 
The only difference between 
the school system today and 
the Mafia is that schools steal 
more money."

A COD1~roD1ise 
on N-S Canal 

SACRAMENTO - A 
measure intended to ease 
approval of the Peripheral 
Canal by writing protections 
for both North and South into 
the state constitution cleared 
its first hurdle in the 
Legislature yesterday. 

Assemblyman Lawrence 
Kapiloff, D-San Diego, 
accepted substantial changes 
in his proposal, ACA90, 
before it was approved by a 6-
o vote of the Assembly Water, 
Parks and Wildlife Commit-
tee, which Kapilofl chairs. 

The proposal needs 
approval by two·thirds of both 
houses before June 26 to 
qualify for the November 
ballot. Its next stop is the 
newly formed Assembly 
Constitutidniil An1enclments 
Committee. 

The canal bill, SB200, 
would authorize construction 
of $5 billion worth of wale r 

projects in Northern 
Califomia, including the $600 
million Peripheral Canal, 
which would carry Sacramen-
to River water throullh the 
Sacramento· San Joaquin 
Delta for export south. 

SB200 has passed the 
Senate and is pending before 
KapiloWs committee. A vote 
is not expected until after the 
June 3 primary election. 
Kapiloff says it will pass, but 
ACA90 is needed to asure 
that the canal will be built. 

ACA90 is intended to 
assure people in the Delta and 
San Francisco Say areas that 
some future Legislature can't 
degrade the Delta water 
quality standards in SB200, 
and to assure Southern 
Californians that Northerners 
can't block construction of the 
canal by lawsuits.

Radio Programmer Gets 
Heat for Playing 'Smut' 
Continued from page 10 
AllOver," by Exile," Painter 
said, "because it goes against 
Christian beliefs about sex 
without marriage." But that 
doesn't mean he won't play 
any song about love between a 
man and woman. 

He said he was accused of 
"prostituting Christianity" 
when he allowed beer 
commercials during Dodger 
games, which his station 
carries. "But I look at it like, 

the commercials are trying to 
sell a brand of beer, and 
anyone who's going to 
respond already drinks beer." 

Referring to polls that show 
a majority of the nation's 
youth consider themselves 
religious, and claim to believe 
in God or a universal being, 
Painter points out that 
religious radio stations playing 
hymns and sermons rank on 
the botton of all the ratings 
charts.
