Regents Stall on Pay 
Poli<:y Conclusions 

Outreach Monies Blank in Budget 
uc board waiting 
on university, state 
audits, and expects a 
major overhaul of 
salary practices. 

By Matt McArdle 
ASSOCIATE NEWS EDITOR 

The UC Board of Regents con-
vened to review the University of 
California's compensation policies, 
which have been under fire ince 
November due to public salary trans-
parency problems, but declined to 
admit wrongdoing until a university-
led audit was finished. 

The meeting, held at Price Center 
on Jan. 18, was 

said, "a significant amount should be 
accomplished by the end of January." . 

Phases two and three will exam-
ine the compensation of the previ-
ous occupants of the top 32 execu-
tive offices and the reimbursement 
of various expenses, such as travel 
costs. 

In addition to hearing the special 
report, the regents voted to amend 
the current compensation policy in 
favor of a new method that estab-
lishes broad salary levels into which 
top employees would be placed by 
UC President Robert C. Dynes. The 
salary structure will be reviewed 
annually and adjusted by the regents. 
Assignments to particular tiers 
would be based on several factors, 
including national salary averages for 

similar positions, 
described by sev-
eral regents as a 
"very serious" mat-
ter, and the board 
heard the first 
presentation from 
the newly created 
special committee 
on compensation, 
chaired by Regent 
Judith Hopkinson, 
regarding pro-
posed changes of 
the university's pay 
policies. 

UC COMPENSATION 
employee quali.fi -
cations and per-
formance. The 
top range would 
be capped at 
$791,600. 

Hopkinson said 
that as soon as an 
audit of executive 
salaries is com-
plete, the univer-
sity could "expect 
a fairly major 
overhaul of [its] compensation prac-
tices." 

"The current policies are difficult, 
unclear, divergent and unorganized," 
Hopkinson said. 

The university has selected a pri-
vate company to conduct a three-
phase audit into its pay methods 
over the past 10 years and to review 
compensation of the top 32 executive 
positions in the university, including 
chancellors and senior vice presi-
dents. 

The university has been scruti -
nized recently following reports pub-
lished by the San Francisco Chronicle 
revealing that it awarded $871 mil-
lion last year to top executives in 
addition to their base pay and over-
time, which has prompted the state 
Legislature to request a separate, 
independent audit. 

Gerald L. Parsky, chair of the 
Board of Regents, said the university 
would fuJly cooperate with any state 
audit into its compensation prac-
tices. 

"We welcome this," Parsky said. 
"We're not paying lip service to this 
area." 

The committee report revealed 
that the university-commissioned 
audit would take at least six months 
to be full and accurate. 

Phase one of the audit will entail an 
assessment of university payroll and 
personnel records, and, Hopkinson 

BillY WONG/GUIIRDlIIN 
Gov. Arnold Schworzenegger listens in as UC Board of Regents Chairman Gerald L. Parksy speaks at the meeting at Price Center on Jan. 
18. The governor's budget proposal doesn 't give funds to vCt community outreach programs, much to the chagrin of student groups. 

Currently, 
the board must 
approve annual 
salaries exceed-
ing $168,000. 

The new 
method would 
make compen-
sation policies 
more "clear, com-
prehensive and 
accountable," 
Parsky said. 

However, 
under the new 
method , the 

regents would need to approve yearly 
salary increases greater than 15 per-
cent.

University labor 
centers and academic 
prep programs get no 
funding under new 
state budget. 

By Charles Nguyen 
NEWS EDITOR 

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's 
budget got a mixed welcome from 
~igher education leaders, garnering 
praise for a $75 million state buyout 
of student fee hikes but criticism for 
cuts to UC outreach programs. 

Funding for the university's labor 
centers and academic preparation 
programs was absent in the budget 
for the second year in a row. Last year, 

Schwarzenegger vetoed $3.8 million 
from the Legislature-approved bud-
get intended for the university's labor 
centers. Labor centers include the 
UCLA Center for Labor Research 
and Education, which studies state 
unions. A specific line-item was not 
included for UC labor centers in 
this year's budget, and will allow the 
university to re-evaluate the way it 
funds its programs, according to the 
governor's budget spokesman H.D. 
Palmer. 

"This is an issue of setting pri-
0rities in the overall budget for the 
university system:' he said. 

The governor abided by terms 
set in the state compact with the 
university, increasing the university's 
base funding by 3 percent. The boost 
will allow UC officials to dole out 

funding where they find appropriate, 
Palmer said. 

Money for labor centers "was pro-
vided on a one-time basis in the 2004 
Budget Act. and these reductions are 
needed to help bring ongoing expen-
ditures in line With existing resourc-
es:' the governor stated in his veto 
message oflabor centers funding. 

The temporary reprieve given to 
the university's academic preparation 
programs required the UC to "work 
with the administration to fullyevalu -
ate the cost -effectiveness of each pro-
gram and eliminate those that cannot 
demonstrate an adequate return on 
investment; Schwarzenegger stated 
in his budget last year. 

The state provided $17.3 million 
in outreach for funding at the time.

Bad Weather Delays U. Centers Opening Ye~ Again 

ALEXANDEII V AJIONDlGUIIRDIIIN 
Construction womrs put finishing touches on the jinDl stage of phase one of the 
University Centers upansion. Completion is slatedfor sometime in the nat few weeb. 

Expansion includes 
Thai restaurant, new 
resource spaces for 
the Women's and 
LGBT Centers. 

By Charles Nguyen 
NEWS EDITOR 

The initial phase of a multimillion-
dollar expansion of University Centers 
will wrap up in the next few weeks, fol -
lowing another delay because of unex-
pected rain, according to University 
Centers Advisory Board Chair Jared 
Feldman. 

A grand opening was planned for 
the first phase, but the university has 
decided to delay an official opening 
until the whole project is finished. The 
center was originally slated for a fall 
opening. 

The complex, however, will have 
separate openings of the Women's 

Center and the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual 
and Transgender Resource .Center, 
Feldman said. 

After the initial delay, the first 
stage, which includes the construction 
of an extension to the Student Center, 
was slated to be ready for student use 
by the beginning of winter quarter, 
University Centers Director and acting 
Vice Chancellor of Student Life Gary 
R. Ratcliff said in October. However, 
unexpected rain last year and over the 
break slowed construction, Feldman 
said. When Student Center does open, 
it will include more than 13,000 square 
feet of space housing dining, seating 
and lounge space as well as Royal Thai, 
a restaurant that has just signed the 
university's lease agreement, Feldman 
said. 

"We want this to be a hub of activ-
ity," he said. "This is going to be a huge 
departure from what people knew as 
the Student Center."

Cali Uses Ed Funds 
Well, Study Finds 
According to a December 

report by the National 
Center for Higher Education 
Management Systems measur-
ing state-by-state spending and 
performance of higher educa-
tion programs. California ranks 
fourth in the nation for the best 
and efficient overall use of its 
funds. 

For the overall ran kings. 
both federal and state appro-
priations and tuition revenue 
were considered . Performance 
factors examined in the report 
included undergraduate enroll-
ment as a percentage of the 
population. awarding of under-
grad uate degrees relative to 
enrollment. timely graduation 
rates, competitive research 
funding and the percentage of 
doctoral degrees . 

The top-five overall states 
were Utah. Massachusetts. 
Colorado. California and North 
Dakota. respectively. Alaska 
ranked last in spending com-
pared to student performance. 

California ranked third in 
the research institutions and 
community colleges categories 
and 16th in the bachelor's and 
master's institutions category of 
the report. 

UC Grades Own 
Research Highly 
A new UC report indicates 

that the university is achieving 
success in the areas of facilitat-
ing timely graduation. effective 
commun ity college transfers. 
degree production in high-pri-
ority areas for the state and the 
transfer of research innovations 
to the marketplace. 

The report shows that the 
university has complied with 
its May 2004 with Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger requiring an 
annual publication of informa-
tion to the state on the universi -
ty 's performance on a variety of 
accou ntability measures. 

The report indicates that last 
year the university awarded a 
total of 54,477 bachelor's, mas-
ter's. doctoral and professional 
degrees. an 18-percent increase 
from four years earlier. 

In addition. the report 
reveals that undergraduate stu-
dents graduate in an average of 
13 quarters and that 80 percent 
of UC undergraduates finish 
their degrees in six vears or 

less . 

Cymer Donates to 
UCSD Scholarships

ship for an undergraduate recip-
ient in the amount of $100.000 
and a graduate recipient in the 
amount of $75,000. The schol-
arships are payable over four 
years. 

Candidates for the two 
awards will be selected from 
UCSD's fall 2006 engineering 
applicant pool. 

Frieder Seible, dean of the 
Jacobs School. praised Cymer's

University Improves 
'Green' Buildings 
According to a new report 

released by the UC Board of 
Regents' committee on grounds 
and buildings, the University of 
California has made significant 
progress in its quest to main-
tain its "green" building. clean 
energy and sustainable trans-
portation policy. 

Moving to meet the policy's 
goals, the university reported 
several accomplishments from 
2005. including its decision to 
extend "green" building stan-
dards to 53 projects approved 
before the July 2004 implemen-
tation date of the program. 

In addition. the university 
revealed that it will reduce 
annual energy costs by as much 
as $5 million by registering 98 
projects in California's "Savings 
by Design Program," which pro-
vides design assistance, energy 
analysis and financial incen-
tives to offset the increased 
costs associated with energy-
efficient buildings. 

The report also lauded UC 
Berkeley for its tirst-in-the-
nation Green Building Research 
Center and UC Merced for its 
environmental stewardship 
practices .

Construction on the new Student 
Center building broke ground last fall, 
and is funded jOintly by reserves from 
the University Center's budget and the 
chancellors office. 

The next phase of the expansion, 
which is scheduled to begin spring 
2007, will remodel the old Student 
Center complex to the design motif o( 
the new building. A $39 quarterly ref-
erendum fee approved by students in 
2003 will pay for the second phase. 

"It's going to be a cosmetic facelift," 
Feldman said. "But the bigger changes 
we want is making it gravitate toward. 
this area." 

The university will demolish the 
North Conference Room in Student 
Center to make way for a plaza. Once 
complete, the expansion would create a 
24-hour study lounge with a computer 
lab and commuter student resources.

â¢ BUDGET, from page 1 
This year, programs such as the 

Early Academic Outreach Program 
and Student-Initiated Outreach will 
face budget burdens under the gover-
nor's plan, according to UC Students 
Association Organizing Director Ruth 
Obel-Jorgensen. 

UCSA board members will meet 
this weekend to plan lobby efforts to 
try to get the Legislature to restore the 
funding, Obel-Jorgensen said. 

The state did not provide money to 
the programs because the UC has no 
solid way of evaluating its programs, 
Palmer said. 

"The issue here is finding a mea-

suring tool for outreach and programs 
like it," he said_ "We want to wait until 
that is complete until we commit to 
any funding:' 

Students will have trouble attend-
ing college with the governor's denial 
of funding to outreach, according to 
UCSA President Anu Joshi. 

"Of course we're thrilled about the 
fee buyback and saving students real 
money, but we are just as concerned 
about limiting access to the thousands 
of students across the state." she stated 
in a press release.

Studying Abroad Heightens Health Risks 

W hat's the technical term for 30 people squeezed into the already cramped Student

perimeter? Surprisingly, it's not Student 
Organization Leadership Office reg-
istration .sessions, but the start of the 
16th A.S. meeting of the year, pre-
empted and abruptly moved due to the 
UC Board of Regents meeting. 

The 45-minute 

, a "hot topic" in the past, this one 
passed rather effortlessly. What did 
spark debate, however, was whether or 
not the A.S. Council should cancel the 
Feb. 22 meeting in order to prepare for 
the "State of the Campus Address." 
... "[ think it would be irresponsible to 
just cancel a meeting;' Revelle College 
Senior Seriator Rachel Corell said, the 
lone vote to keep the meeting as sched-
uled. However, 16 senators voted for can-

cellation, so a word 
to the wise: Don't delay didn't seem

lack of space in the room. With six 
sen'ators, several nonvoting council-
members and the public missing, so 
was much of the conflict that's given 
this correspondent something to write 
about for the last few weeks. 

Despite the looming special elec-
tion, and the regents pow-wow that 
had taken place directly downstairs 
only a few hours earlier, the A.S. 
Council took on an extremely hard-
hitting and imperative topic for its 
council caucus: whether to serve bacon 
or sausage at the next A.S. Mid.night 
Pancake Breakfast. . 

"Generally, the girls preferred bacon 
and the boys preferred sausage." A.S. 
Vice President of Academic Affairs 
Harry Khanna said, causing t~e room 
to erupt Â·in laughter. Ten additional 
minutes of sausage jokes and a vote 
later, not much was resolved. [t was 
unclear which side dish actually won. 

On the old business agenda, the 
council unanimously approved a reso-
lution to divest from companies alleg-
edly supporting genocide in Sudan. 
Though political resolutions have been

the council has the right to change 
the number of days in which the A.S. 
Council must respond to a special dec-
tion petition. The item originally began 
as clarification to the polioes govern-
ing signature collection, but the coun-
cil was not sure how it felt on malcing 
amendments to other amendments on 
the fly. Sixth College Senior Senator 
Matt Corrales, who proposed the origi-
nal changes. argued that the alterations 
were so minor that waiting the two-
week legislative cycle was unneces-
sary. However, Corell was adamant that 
the council's constituents needed the 
time to approach their representatives 
and offer feedback, if they so desired. 
Ultimately, ~nators de!=ided to table 
the item for one week. 

To conclude the evening, Eleanor 
Roosevelt College Freshman Senator 
Kari Gohd provided the council with a 
list of synonyms for the word "shady" 

. to provide a variety of alternatives to 
councilmembers who often use the 
word to criticize pending legislation.

Students may want to start think-
ing about potential health concerns 
months prior to packing their bags 
and heading to another country for 
a study-abroad program. 

. And they should begin soon, as 
applications for programs to study 
abroad during the upcoming or fall 
are usually due around this time of 
year, 

When going abroad via the 
Education Abroad Program and 
9rganizations such as Travel Study, 
students must undergo a health 
evaluation by a doctor to ensure 
they are up to date with their immu-
nizations. 

The required vaccinations vary 
depending on the country to which 
students are traveling. . 

The Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention Web site suggests 
that students make. appointments 
with their doctors in the United 
States eight weeks . prior to travel. 
Some immunization series can take 
approximately six months to com-
plete. . 

According to the CDC, the avian 
flu has been reported among humans 
in Cambodia, China, Indonesia, 
Thailand, Thrkey and Vietnam . 

"There is no vaccination [for 
the avian flu], so the main thing 
to avoid is contact with poultry," 
said Ashley Christiani, primary care 
college chairwoman at the UCLA 
David Geffen School of Medicine. 
"Avoid eating undercooked poultry 
or raw eggs." 

Christiani recommends that stu-
dents wash their hands frequently 
and carry alcohol-based hand sani-
tizers in order to help prevent sick-
ness, especially in areas where there 
may not J)e good access to water.

The students were asked to bring 
medications they used on a regular 
basis. 

"The brand names don't neces-
sarily carryover abroad," Heidari 
said. "Sometimes it's tough to find 
what you're looking for, especially 
when the language is different."

EAP requires students to have 
health insurance that will provide 
coverage while they are abroad. The 
UCLA Student Health Insurance 
Plan only gives 50 percent coverage

internationally, so students some-
times opt to purchase secondary 
insurance. 

The health and safety practices 
of EAP begin when students inquire 
about the programs, and do not stop 
until they return to their campuses, 
stated Bruce Hanna, director of stra-
tegic marketing and communica-
tions for EAP, in an e-mail. 

He added that an important part 
of EAP practices is to make sure 
students understand their personal 
responsibilities and the importan~e 
of having a safe and healthy experi-
ence abroad. 

. There are Â· measures students 
can take to protect themselves from 
common illnesses. 

"Depen.ding on the country they 
are traveling to, gastrointestinal 
complaints seem to be number one." 
Christiani sald. 

Not eating undercooked meat or 
drinking water that may appear to 
be contaminated can help alleviate 
this problem, she said. 

"In general, if there is any kind 
of doubt in terms of the quality of 
the water, don't drink it." Christiani 
said. "Even with brushing teeth. it 
doesn't take a lot of water to get 
you sick:' 

Although water is present in 
common uses, students should still 
be wary, according to Christiani. 

"What I students are] eating 
should be cooked or something that 
can be peeled and not risk that it's 
been washed with tainted water;' 
she said. 

Hanna also said that EAP closely 
monitors health issues developing 
around the world to gauge poten-
tial impact on students ' and staff 
abroad. 

Other safety practices the CDC 
details include notifying local con-
tacts of personal locations and itin-
eraries, not standing out, not travel-
ing alone at night and practicing 
safe road travel.

Let's Talk Procrastination - Wait, 
Hold On, I Need to Check My E-mail

nne Madden 

As I sat writ ing notes for this column while docking hours 
. at my internship, I had an 
epiphany. Google has it exactly right: 
The company lets its employees 
spend 20 percent of their time at 
work on personal projects. 

Why is thi~ the right idea? 
Because, just as 90 percent of any-
thing is crap, 20 percent of anyone's 
time is spent fucking around - espe-
cially if you're getting paid to have 
your behind in the cotrect chair. For 
insufferable overachievers, cut that 
percentage to between 10 and t 5 per-
cent. And for the rest, adjust that up 
to 25 percent - or, hell, even more, 
depending on how schoofed you are 
in the art of procrastinndo. For me, 
I'm lucky if any less than a third of 
my "work time" is spent with my 
mind elsewhere. (When scheduline. 
I adjust for inflation. An assignment 
that should take two hours takes 
three. And so on. It's like paying a tax 
for A.D.D., except instead of paying 
with money, you pay with minutes 
and hours of your life.) 

E\(en at UCSo, a world-class insti -
tution of learning where I expected 
to be surrounded by wall-to-wall, 
nose-to-the-grindstone types, pro-
crastination is like a class that every-
one takes, but which professors don't 
acknowledge and that no one earns 
units for passin~. 

Instead, the value of this non-
course is measured in cheap, quick 
thriUs (like the joy of play.ing Internet 
poker while one's boss lurks five feet 
away), then guilt, then frustration 
(when you realize you must pull. 
an all -nighter if you want 3"Y hope 
of completing the. paper that was 
assigned five weeks prior), then 
the bittersweet payoff of actually 
completing one's work (bittersweet 
because, dammit, procrastination 
is sorta fun) . Procrastination is so 
prevalent among UCSD students, 
you're a freak if you don't engage 
in it. My friends look at me like 
I'm crazy when, after they complain 
about poor' grades or having to pull 
alJ-rl ighters, 1 bitchily tell them they 
cou ld aVOid the problem by not put-

ting off their work, goddammit. 
But, at the same time, I'm coo-

vinced that many friendships are 
founded and sustained on procrasti-
nation - we do need someone to talk 
to while PUtting off important work, 
after all (though one hates to be the 
Friend That Only Gets Called When 
The Other Person is Bored; that's a 
low tier of social impOrtance). 

The mark of a truIy professional 
procrastinator is that she spends her 
procrastination sessions doing the 
most inane shit possible. We're talk-
ing activities that have no payoff 
whatsoever, except for a quick rush 
of adrenaline or cheap amusement.

So far this morning, for example, 
I've redone my hair, checked my nails 
(twice), picked lint off my blazer (for 
ten minutes), written four pages of

small moment of gloating. 

Things would be different if the 

Internet connection at my office 
wasn't down today; I would've obses-
sively checked and rechecked all 
my e-mail accounts (even the spam 
ones) and checked every news, gos-
sip and entertainment Web site I 
know - even the sucky ones. 

This morning was a true exer-

until a deadline comes within 24 
hours of the present. There's nothing 
that screams "I have cell phone min-
utes to waste on inane conversationsÂ· 
like WPaper due at 9 a.m. tomorrow." 

Why is that? What evil natural 
law makes silly activities so much 
more compelling when important 
tasks beckon? Why do TV shows 
turn fascinating when I've got a 
deadline to meet? Why does my 
mind dance with dreams of weekend

Why, for the love of Christ, can I only 
bring myself to do laundry or make

of humor. Or maybe I need Adderall. 
I'm not sure. 

As truly top-notch procrastinators

my room, respond to e-mail$, shop 
for groceries. delete old files from 
my computer, wash m}' car and catch

to admit this - my most productive 
moments come while procrastinat-

all hopes for peace on dreams of immediate 
IsraeliÂ·Palestinian reconciliation, Israel has 
taken active steps to ensure that both people 
have the opportunity to live in relative quiet. 
Commencing this previous August, Israel 
began a difficult withdrawal from the Gaza

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR--
Article Unfairly Maligns 

Intelligent Design 
Dear Editor: 

I thought that overall your article, wWhen 
Real Judicial Conservatives Attack" was mod Â· 
erately fair, but my concern is not with issue 
of the "name caUing" ofthe Intelligent Design 
group. My concern is how you have repre-
sented 1.0. You have called it "nonsense" and 
inferred that its proponents are dishonest. 
Now both of these things may be the case 
(I believe them not to be), but to slide these 
(unjustified) comments under the rug is both 
sly and dishonest. The federal appeals court 
in the recent to. case was not a ruling on the 
Validity of the theory, but was a ruling on the 
misuse of 1.0. by the Dover School District. 
Thus to insinuate the nonsensical nature and 
dishonesty of 1.0. as a theory was done with-
out justification; this is my qualm. 

Maybe you could do an article on what 
1.0. actually argues. I would like to give 
kudos for the remark: "intelligent design isn't 
supposed to be about God at all." which is 
perfectly correct. I just wanted to say that, for 
most people miss that point.

Outdoor Cigarette Smoke 
Not Significantly Harmful 

Dear Editor: 
In your Jan. 12 issue, a letter complained 

that "40,000 nonsmoking Americans die year-
ly due to exposure to secondhand smoke," 
then alluded to students being "forced to 
breathe others' secondhand smoke as they've 
walked to or from class." 

I don't remember ever walking through a 
cloud of smoke to get to class, but setting that 
aside for the sake of argument, I wonder: How 
many of the 40,000 mentioned above died 
from incidental outdoor smoke? In terms 
of research, could health effects possibly be 
attributed to such minimal exposure? 

I(i wager gasoline -burning vehicles do 

more damage to our lungs at UCSD than do 
people smoking here and there on campus.

UCSD Alumnus' Political 
Campaign Worth Support 

Dear Editor: 
I am a senior at San Diego State University. 

I am writing this letter in regards to the 
article, ' UCSD's Varied Political Spectrum:Â· 
I, for one, am very excited that UCSD alum-
nus Bryan Barton is running for Congress. 
I look forward to voting for him because he 
really looks out for student rights. Because 
the 53rd CongreSSional District. has more 
college students than any other district in 
the country, we need someone like Barton to 
represent us. 

I will soon be re-registering to vote for Ihe 
.2006 election and I would urge others to reg-
ister as well, especially college students.

Pocahontas and Smith Gracefully 
Â·Recapture the Garden of Eden 

OF NEW LINE 
Swcuhbucklin ': Colin Farrell plays mh century English explorer John Smith, who became entranced by the youl1g 
Pochahontas (portrayed by 14-year-old actress Q'Orianka Kilcher), in Terrence Malick's latest historical drama. 

By Kaveh Keshmiri 
SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

In his fourth film in 30 years, Terrence Malick's "The New World" is a graceful interpretation set in the historic backdrop of the English 
colonization of America in 1607. Following 
his World War II examination of U.S. soldiers' 
existential narratives in "The Thin Red Line," 
Malick reaches even further into history, to 
the English settlement of the new land and its 
Native people, disclosing the clash between the 
English and Native cultures. 

Fortunately, "New World" lacks the tear-
jerking Hallmark moral to which the savage tale 
could easily have led. Malick decides instead to 
unveil the disillUSioning fate of a young Native 
heroine (Q'Orianka Kilcher) in her journey to 
empathize with Europe and its multifaceted 
soul. Initially, the fum gravitates around the 
adventurous spirit of John Smith (Colin Farrell) 
and his troop of semisenile sailors as they 
attempt to survive in a world bereft of the long 
shadow of the state and church. Later, we meet 
the Native commune: primitive, altruistic and 
harmoniously hierarchical. 

The depth of the production lies in its lack 
of verbal articulation. Instead, Malick presents 
a continuous sketch of characters absorbed in a 
world of fleeting passion and desolate routes of 
escape. The most vivid account is the affectionate 
relationship between Smith and the Native tribe's 
princess (also known as Pocahontas in previous 
adaptations of the story). From their first shared 
glances, Malkk captures the engaging glare of 
human frailty on the brink of an unquenchable 
curiosity. Before spoiling their waltz with the 
fate that awaits them, Malick shares a number of 
intimate (and wordless) scenes between the two 
caressing and playing under various wondrous 
sites reminiscent of an America that presently 
exists only in imagination. 

The New World 

**** Colin Farrell. Christian Bale. Q'Orianka Kilcher 
Directed by Terrence Malick 

Opens Jan. 20 
Rated PG-13 

Malick freezes time when the two are 
entwined in their forsaken world. Restraining 
their own yearning impulses, the pair remains 
content with synchronous play and impassioned 
attention. No sex, no overtly erotic orcbestra 
music, not even any foreplay; all that Malick 
spies into is the naked, innate force of passion 
by which two foreign characters are both struck. 
And so they resist indulgence in the face of 
anxiety and are thus treated to God's garden for 
the scenes displayed on screen. The surreally 
Simplistic company of Farrell and !GIcher puts 
Sofia Coppola's expatriate "Lost in Translation" 
duo to network shame. Though the two lov-
ers are eventually booted from the garden, it is 
their individual decisions and their respective 
instincts that entangle the once-pure relation -
ship. With no serpent or tree to blame, Smith 
personally retreats with no binding burden to 
resolve but his own. 

For the remainder of the ftlm. Malick fol -
lows the heroine's postimpressionistic life. 
Exiled from her tribe for befriending Smith, she 
becomes an English-speaking, dress-wearing 
housewife of a charmingly polite and respec-
tive farmer, earnestly played by Christian Bale. 
In a heart-wrenching scene at the elopement of 
the two, there hangs the same independently 
fitted cross hovering over the Native's head as 
she relinquishes any past she may have once 
lived. 

In its conclusion, the ftlm seems a bit too 
restraining. Its virtuous use of ambivalence 
compels the audience to construe their own 
rendition of inner monologue that mayor may 
not be in sync with the characters' motives. The 
strength of the ftlm, nonetheless. lies in the 
same issue. Malick is as disciplined a fIlmmaker 
as our generation can experience at the theaters. 
This film is not so much a prejudging docu-
mentary of abusively savage colonizers pointing 
rifles at the innocent Indians; it is a love slory 
that is thrown into a setting between savage 
naivete and ambitious masculinity, mixed at 
the clash of subjective choices - and the con-
sequences these choices entail. It is a new world 
where power and responsibility are inverted 
- shifted from the Empire and the tribe to the 
individual in hope of creating a fresh semblance 
of harmony and order. which turns out all too 
tragically.

Praise the Gods! Woody Allen Stays 
Offscreen in His Elegant, Erotic Comeback 

By Ania Dylewska 
SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

Writing off "Match Point" as a typicaJ Woody Allen comedy is akin to asserting thai the dreari-
ness of the first 20 minutes is indicative 
of the entire edgy, clever film. The 
story unfolds like a BBC melodrama: A 
struggling outsider - in this case, for-
mer tennis pro Chris Wilton (Jonathan 
Rhys-Meyers) - gets a job working for 
the British aristocracy, teaching ten-
nis lessons at an uppity country club 
and subsequently, with the help of an 
acquaintance Tom Hewett (Matthew 
Goode), climbs the social ladder. But 
there is no reason to fret; the hack-
neyed premise quickly receives a jolt 
and morphs into an involved, gripping 
study of faith, luck, love, lust, adultery, 
betrayal, consequence, crime and con-
science. 

COU RTESY Of DREAMWORKS 
Wcu it goodfor you?: In "Match Point: Jonathan Rhys-Meyers plays a social climbing 
Irishman who has a passionate affair with his brother<-in-law's fiancee (Soorlett Johansson). 

As Chris establishes a kinship with 
Tom and, in time, marries Tom's sister 
Chloe (Emily Mortimer), he secures 
for himself a life of comfort, luxury 
and rather monotonous stability. At 
the same time, the unexpected hap-
pens when Chris meets Tom's fian-
cee Nola Rice (Scarlett Â· Johansson). 
Instant infatuation seems too feeble an 
expression to describe the magnetism 
generated by the twosome during their 
nuanced power play - a subliminally 
erotic conversation and a game of 
ping pong. The apparent complication 
pumps the staggering storyline with 
a much-needed shot of adrenaline, 

and the rest of the fUm operates at an 
engulfing, quick-paced strut. 

who is fatefully plain and unexciting, 
but genuinely compassionate. 

At its core, "Match Point" is an 
operatic tragedy - with impecca-
bly timed operatic compositions 
- grounde4 to a perceptible, real-
istic level by stark cinematography, 
insightful character development 
and natural acting. Rhys-Meyers' 
androgynous physicality automati-
cally arms him with a crucial deceit-
ful quality. He takes a bit of time to 
settle into his role, but eventualJy, he 
succeeds in preserving that narrow 
middJe boundary - not making the 
character too detestable or too piti-
ful. His portrayal of Chris' emotional 
torment and his moral breakdown 
is surprising. Johansson effortless-
ly exudes Nola's inherent sexuality, 
as weU as her masked desperation. 
Goode is charming as a chivalrous 
playboy from an affluent family, and 
Mortimer beautifully fills the thank-
less role of the intelligent, nice gul 

The film goes through a series of 
twists, and becomes a rather cynicaJ 
exploration of the way faith and luck 
function in Chris' life. He concurrently 
secures a prosperous life with Chloe 
and pursues the alluring Nola with 
lust, but his bold actions lead to con-
sequences. As the stakes rise and lives 
are ruined, Chris is forced to make the 
ultimate choice between a life that is 
dull but carefree and one that is pas-
sionate but hopeless.

Rated R 

"Match Point" is intensely thrill-
ing, sophisticatedly entertaining and 
provocatively unsettling. The title is 
fitting: Just as arnazing match points 
between tennis greats like Andre 
Agassi and Roger Federer can inspire 
reminiscent discussions, Allen's 
accomplishment is bound to stimu-
late some curious conversations, 
particularly with the awards season 
underway.

The Advantage 
â¢ EH-TItled 
5 RUE CHRISTINE 

The time is nigh - in a few more years, we will officially become the final generation to have played 
the original Nintendo Entertainment 
System as children. This will give way 
to the Sega Genesis/Super Nintendo 
generation, and fmally (shudder) the 
Nintendo64generation. Luckily, there 
are just enough n?stalgic video game 
nerds around to call for a Nintendo 
cover band: Enter the Advantage. 

Translating the uber-com-
plex beeps and shuffles of the NES 
into bass, drums and guitars, the 
Advantage keep one foot in the 
realm of stony math -rock (drum-
mer Spencer Seim is the guitarist for 
HeIla) and the other in the video-
game world of powerups, secret codes 
and extra guys. Separately, the band 
members are inarguably virtuosic, 
but they integrate unerringly at a jig-
sawed, breakneck pace, emulating the 
careening momentum of the arcade. 

Fatlip 
â¢ Theloneliltst Punk 
THE lAB 

*** In the never-ending rap game to prove w~o's harder, Fatlip straight up surrenders. You might have 
seen him in Ludacris' video for "Get ' 
Back; basicalJy getting crushed for 
being so artnoying. He's spent the last 
10 years (after being kicked out of 
'90s success the Pharcyde) . living in 
his mom's house with writer's block. 

So the guy's a wreck. But some-
how he's managed to put out his flfst 
solo album, and aside from a few 
boring interludes, it's surprisingly 
captivating. He drools , growls and 
spits in the throaty style of his East 
Coast heroes over distinctly West 
Coast production ("Beats that OD'd 
the Bastard.") about nothing other 
than his own pathetic life. 

Sometimes the shameless exhibi-
tion of self-doubt goes a little' over-
board, like on "What's Up Fatlip" 
(which was the album's first single, 

Though they may have recorded some 
of the best N ES themes on their 2004 
self-titled debut (from, say, "Zelda," 
"Blaster Master" and "Ninja Gaiden"), 
the band is even more accomplished 
on EIf-TItled, playing like machine 
men in true-to-speed renditions of 
classic themes from "Mega Man 2," 
Â· Castlevania 2: Simon's Quest" and 
"Metroid." Hearing the music from 
these titles played by real instruments 
is more than just a cheap thrill; the 
compositions themselves are, in 
hindsight, brilliant. Luckily, the hard 
work and genius of all those name-
less Japanese men that created such 
memorable music in the late '80s will 
not be forever lost in the bottom of 
the closets of ex-garners everywhere. 
Thank the. painstaking arrangements 
and instrumental dexterity of the 
Advantage.

released - cringe - five years ago). 
"1 make myself sick, get on my own 
nerves/ Immature, insecure grown 
up nerd ." he laments over a tin-
kling carousel loop. But after an 
album's worth of cheesy hooks and 
comical pokes at himself, it becomes 
apparent that he's not taking the 
whole thing very seriously, and we 
shouldn't either. 

Squeak E. Clean and former 
Pharcyde partner J-Swift lend their 
talents to the catchy, bass-heavy beats, 
but much of Fatlip's album is admi-
rably self-produced. There's nothing 
very experimental or advanced about 
his delivery, yet therein lies most of 
its charm. He's just an old guy chok-
ing 011 his own spit and making our 
heads bob - the charismatic loser is 
irresistible.

. Pitt, Seattle 
Have Date in 
Motor City 

â¢ PlAYOFFS, from page 1 2 
some myths of their own, proving 
that the Chicago Bears' defense was 
not the best thing since sliced bread 
and that their offense wasn't the worst 
thing since Jolt! Cola. In the process, 
Steve Smith emerged as the best play-
er left in the playoffs. On the other 
hand, the Carolina defense showed 
that the numbers making them the 
third-best defense in the league lied. 
as Bears quarterback Rex Grossman 
looked like former Bears quarterback 
Jim McMahon without the headband. 
Of course. while Grossman was doing 
his best McMahon impersonation, 
Carolina quarterback Jake Delhomme 
was passing by more esteemed quarter-
backs like Tom Brady, John Elway and 
Joe Montana to become the highest-
rated passer in NFL playoff history. 

The NFC title matchup features 
thl MVP, the best player left and the 
highest -rated postseason quarterback. 
Alexander suffered a concussion, and 
Carolina is down to its third, although 
still strong. running back, so the first 
team to give up a score will play catch-
up the rest of the game. Neither defense 
is as well-rounded as either offense, 
meaning both should be able to move 
the ball, although I expect Seattle to 
play Smith better than Chicago did. 
Carolina could playa game like they did 
two years ago. upsetting the Eagles, but 
that Panthers team was underappreci-
ated and overlooked and Seattle won't 
commit the same mistake Philadelphia 
did. Carolina, as they did four times 
during the season, will disappoint one 
week after playing impressively. 

foe's Pick: Seattle Se4hawlcs 
Steelen at Broncos 

Despite Pittsburgh's 2005 champi-
onship experience and the addition 
of pace-changing running back Willie 
Parker, Pittsburgh wasn't seen as a 
major threat ~o what many thought 
would be Colts quarterback Peyton 
Manning's coronation in the Super 
Bowl. Unfortunately for Manning and 
the Colts, Pittsburgh had a script of its 
own, using the same masked blitzes 
that the Chargers and Patriots have 
employed to frustrate Manning. An 
uncharacteristic Jerome Bettis fumble 
and a late replay call, the single worst 
decision any person has ever made 
with the benefit of video evidence, 
near1y gave the Cohs the win. However, 
Mike Vanderjagt embraced his posi-
tion as the Â«idiot kicker" by shank-
ing a 46-yard game-tying field goal as 
the football gods righted the referee's 
wrongs and the Steelers roUed on. 

The Denver Broncos did something 
no other team could do in the last 
two years, ending the New EnsJand 
Patriots' chance for a three-peat. In 
the process, Denver spared us from 
having to hear annoying Bostonians 
say the Patriots are better than the 
'70s Steelers and Montana's 4gers. The 
Broncos have two great backs, a Pro-
Bowl quarterback and a home-field 
advantage second to none. They used 
this and a defense full of early-round 
picks with something 10 prove to beat 
the champs. A wise man once said, 
"To be the man, you've got to beat the 

man~ and the Broncos did just that. 
The Steelers have a legacy chock 

full of manliness with men's men like 
Franco Harris, "Mean" Joe Greene 
and the deceptively tough but graceful 
Lynne Swann. While the Broncos have 
two toogh tailbacks thai compliment 
one another, so do the Steeiers, and one 
of them is Jerome "The Bus' Bettis, 
a surefire hall-of-famer whose name 
lets you know somebody's getting run 
over. The deciding factor should be 
the mile-high altitude in Denver that 
seems to take opponents' breath away. 
However, I'm making the deciding fac-
tor in this game my political science 
professor, Keith Poole. It's his grizzled 
appearance, hilarious critiques of early 
American presidents and declaration 
of Pittsburgh as the ONLY football 
team in America that have ultimately 
convinced me that the Steelers are 
headetl for Super 80wI XL
