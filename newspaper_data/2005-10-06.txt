UCAB ' chooses' Thai restaurant 
Board finalizing lease with Royal Thai 

Iy CHAltW NGUYEN 
News Editor 

The first phase of the University 
Centers expansion, originally slated 
for a fall opening, will not open 
until December and will include 
a new restaurant serving Thai 
cuisine, according to U niversity 
Centers Director and acting Vice 

hancellor of Student Life Gary 
R. Ratcliff. 

As a part of the expansion's first 
phase, University Centers has pro-
vided a shell for the restaurant, 
whi h will then furnish the space at 
its own expense, Ratcliff said. The 
first part of expan ion on Student 
Center broke ground last faU, and 
will be funded jointly by reserves 
from the University Centers budget 
and the chancellor's office. Once 
the building opens, students will 
have access to 13,000 square feet of 
fiacilities, including dining, seating, 
lounge space, the Thai restaurant 
and new locations for the Women's 
Center and campus groups. 

"On the first floor of the build-
ing [will be] things of more use to 
students, including places to eat, 
sit and relax," Ratcliff said. "When 
you think about it, there's no place 
for students to do that kind of 
thing at the Student Center. Plus, 
another restaurant will mean less

wait at other eateries, and more 
choices on campus." 

The opening of the project's 
first phase was postponed because 
of rain delays last winter, according 
to Ratcliff. 

"It's just a rninorsetback, a month 
or so," he said. "Construction allows 
us a set number of rain days, which 
was overshot with last winter's large 
rain season." 

The University Centers expan-
sion, which includes develop-
merit of Student Center and Price 

Center, has been able to stay within 
budget, "")ut has faced challenges 
from al1 ibnonnal real estate mar-
ket, Raccliff said. 

"The construction market 
and cost escalation in San Diego 
has been the worst it's been in 20 
years," he said. "It has an impact 
on every construction project on 
campus. You're trying to buy the 
same square footage at a higher 
cost. Because the construction pric-

RIAA sues eight more at UCSD 
Identities of new lawsuit defendants still unknown 

By VLADIMIR lOGAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

Record companies charged 
eight more UCSD Internet users 
last week with illegal ly sharing 
copyrighted music, bringing the 
total number of campus affiliates 
who have faced pirating charges 
over the past six months to 35. 

As in the first two rounds of 
lawsuits filed in April and late May, 
all eight defendants are accused of 
violating federal copyright laws by 
illicitly using "i2hub" file-sharing 
software through the special aca-
demic Internet2 network, which 
allows file transfers to occur at just 
a fraction of the time required for 
regular technology. 

Though the Recording 
Industry AsSO<.iation of America 
said that those charged were guilty 
of "very egregious" and "harmful" 
conduct, the group did not release 
specific statistics on the number of 
songs each is accused of sharing. 
In its first wave of lawsuits last 
spring, the RIM said it was tar-
geting students sharing an average 
of 2,300 songs each. 

"Those who continue to 
engage in this online theft pose a 
direct threat to the music commu-
nity's ability to invest in new bands 
and the new music that fans want 

to hear," RlAA President Cary 
Sherman stated in the group's 
press release. "These lawsui ts are 
an important part of our defense 
against that threat." 

According to supporting docu-
ments filed with the federal district 
court in San Diego, the defendants 
in the most recent wave of suits 
are all said to have used i2hub 
through the campus network 
in August and early September. 
Though the RIAA suggested 
that aU of the defendants were 
students, Academic Computing 
Services Director Tony Wood said 
it was possible that some of those 
charged may have been attendees 
at the many conferences hosted on 
campus during the summer. 

Neither the university nor 
the recording companies know 
the names of the defendants, all 
identified only by their Internet 
Protocol addresses and listed sim-
ply as "John Doe" in the lawsuits. 

A sample of songs the record 
companies believe the eight have 
shared illegally - listed in an 
exhibit attached to the lawsuit 
- includes a variety of perform-
ers and genres, ranging from the 
Eagles' "Hotel California" to 
Snoop Dog's -Lay Low." 

In their announcement of the 
suits, record companies also praised

A.S. Council votes to 
table SRTV ban on nudity 
Proposed amendments would make 
statton accountable to A.S. Council 

By CHARLES NGUYEN 
News Editor 

The .S. Council voted to 
table indefinitely amendments to 
Student-Run Television's charter, 
specifically a change involving the 
broadcast of nudity, at a meeting on 
Oct. 5. The move effectively rejects 
the proposal. 

The change, drafted by 
Commis ioner of Student erviccs 
Maurice Junious, would have pro-
hibited "graphic depictions of sex-
ual activity involving nudity." T he 
amendment was tabled indefinitely 
by consensus, with one abstention, 
by the A.S. Internal Committee. 
The council, in turn, voted to accept 
the committee's recommendation. 

SRTY, funded by the counci~ 
allows indecent material, including 
sexual nudity, as long as it was not 
copyrighted and aired between 10 
p.m. and 6 a.m. Junious' proposals 
aI 0 included changing the account-
ability of the station from the student 
body to the A.S. Council, which was 
approved by the members. 

RTV managers opposed the 
potential amendment, citing the 
First Amendment and free speech 
rights, according to Station Co-
Manager Andrew Tess. 

The changes have come as a 
result of an incident last spring 
when Steve York, a fonner John 
Muir College student and editor 
of the KOIIIa, aired sexual acts on 
the closed-circuit television station, 

according to "less. Following the 
broadcast, the .S. Council issued a 
resolution denouncing pomohrraphy 
on SRT . 

'" would say the Kook, was 1 00 
percent respon ible," Tess said before 
the vote. "We have had that kind 
of content on our station before, 
but after Steve York' piece, we have 
the cow1cil presenting these amend-
ments. It i the name of the Koaln and 
what [that narnel brings with it." 

Junious did not respond to 
requests for comment. The rejected 
amendments to the charter clearly 
violate court precedents, according 
to Tess, referring pecifically to a 
provision on the Web site of the 
Student Press Law enter which 
state that, "The courts have ruled · 
tha t if a school crea tes a student 
news or inforn1ation medium and 
allows students to serve as editors, 
the First Amendment drastically 
limits the chool 's ability to censor." 

But because the council provide 
funding to the station, it has the 
right to regulate content as it pleases, 
according to Acting Assi tant Vice 
Chance.llor of Student Life Gary 
R. Raccliff. The A.S. Council had 
consulted campus counsel Daniel W. 
Park, who found that content regu-
lation was legal, Ratcliff said. 

"SR1V is a service of the A.S. 
Council, so the council can set what-
ever content guidelines it so choos-
es," he said. " If AS decides, for

University creates 

digital library 
Libraries of the University of 

California partnered with several 
entities this week to create a 
free international digital library. 
The university will offer books 
and resources to the /ublic, by 
collecting noncopyrighte literature, 
according to a university press 
release. The Web site, http:// 
www.opencontentaJ/iance.org, 
will offer the materials through 
support from the Open Content 
Alliance, composed of ~roups 
such as Yahoo! and the University 
of Toronto. Through the service, 
books owned by UC libraries will be 
digitized and placed into an online 
archive, using a cheaper method 
of scanning technology that costs 
10 cents per page. The libraries of 
the 10000mpus UC system form the 
biggest research library in the world, 
according to the press release. 

"'We're pleased to join the OCA 
and begin making this important 
part of our national cultural heritage 
freely available online: stated 
Daniel Greenstein, associate vice 
provost and university librarian for 
the California Digital Library at the 
University of California, in the press 
release. 

Other groups in the consortium 
include Adobe, European Archive, 
Hewlett Packard Labs, Internet 
Archive, the United Kingdom's 
National Archives, O'Reilly Media 
and Prelinger Archives. 

UC wins ~atent 
battle over browser 

The u.s. Patent and Trademark 
Office confirmed the University of 
California's rights to an Internet 
browser technology patent last week 
after a legal battle with Microsoft 
Corp., according to a UC press 
release. 

"'We are gratified that the pat· 
ent office's re-examination has vali-
dated its onglnal evaluation of the 
university's unique contribution to 
the technology, which fuels the 
Internet,' stated James E. Holst, 
the university's general counsel, in 
a release. "This decision ensures 
that the patent rights of the public 
institution that developed this tech· 
nology, a significant innovation with 
wide-reaching public benefits and 
use, will be protected." 

The patent was first issued to the 
university in 1998 and was revisited 
by the PTO after the university and 
Eolas Technologies, Inc, brought a 
lawsuit against Microsoft Corp. for 

patent infringement 
In the recent PTO notice, the 

patent examiner found that the 
university had originally devel-
oped the technology and legal~ 
owned the patent nghts. The pat· 
ent's origins can be traced back 
to 1993, when Michael Doyle, 
Eolas president and former UC 
researcher, began working with UC 
San Francisco researchers on Web 
site interactivity. The innovation 
was originally meant to address 
how SCientific information was 
accessed and published on Web 
sites. By 1995, the research of 
Doyle and the university gave birth 
to other interactive mediums on 
the Internet, shaping the way the 
tool is used today. 

Merced dass smaller 
than expected 

The first class at UC Merced is 
smaller than expected, with 875 
inaugural students, compared to 
1,000 original~ predicted by cam-
pus officials. according to a student 
census. 

"'We've a/ways known that a cer· 
tain number of committed students 
would need to postpone or can· 
cel their enrollment plans despite 
their best efforts and intentions,' 
UC Merced Provost David Ashley 
stated in the release. 'At the same 
time, we're thrilled to have a very 
Sizable first class of highly qualified 
students who reflect the pioneering 
SPirit and uniquely diverse character 
of our entire state. For those who 
couldn't complete enrollment th is 
year, we strongly urge them to reap-
ply as their individual circumstances 
permit." 

In June, admissions officials 
had received 1,051 statements 
of intent to register. The census, 
based on class registration, found 
80 percent freshman, 15 percent 
transfer students and 4 percent 
graduate students. The census also 
revealed that almost half of the stu· 
dents in the first class are the first 
in their family to attend college, 
while 31 percent are from minor-
ity groups underrepresented on 
Univers ity of California campuses. 
Seventeen percent of those first-
generation college students said 
they came from families earning 
less than $30,000 annually. Eighty 
percent of Merced's first-year class 
applied for and received financial 
aid, while 64 percent of those 
students qualified for need-based 
financial assistance. The campus 
plans to enroll 1,000 students 
more next year, with a projected 
enrollment of 25,000 by 2035.

I A.s. COUNCIL AT A GLANCE 
A.S. Meeting t7 - Oct. 5 

Public Input 
Student-Run Television Co-
Man~ger Andy Tess announced 
that SRTV is looking to form 
partnerships with other student 
organizations to provide airtime 
for different programs addressing 
a broad variety of campuswide 
issues. 

Items of Immediate 
Consideration 
Item A 

A motion to move $500 to the 
external affairs office from the 
general unallocated fund for the 
A.S. Voter Registration Campaign 
was passed by consensus. 

Item D 
The council postponed a vote 

on a proposed change to its con-
tract with Micro 101 , which would 
remove a clause Umiting Associated 
Students from "procurlingJ. 
rent[ing] or leas[ingJ" appliances 
from other vendors during the 
2005-06 school year. While the 
motion to remove the clause passed 
in internal committee, council-
members debated whether or not 
it was appropriate or businesslike 
to amend a contract in progress 
before negotiating specific terms 
with the vendor. Ultimately, the 
vote was deferred for one week in 
order to allow for an additional 
meeting between the A.S. enter-
prises office and Micro 101. 

Reports 
Vice President Finance 
Greg Murphy 

Murphy noted that more 
people have taken notice of the 
A.S. Council's budget surplus and 
urged senators to vote to increase 
funds to programs that "greatly 
benefit UCSD," citing specifi-
cally the A.S. programming office 
and the Women's Commission as 
examples. 

Muir Council Chair Neil Spears 
Spears announced that the 

John Muir College Council raised 
its funding limit for non-Muir 
organizations holding events out-
side of the college from S60 to 
$75. 

Panhellenic Representative 
Erica Malouf 

Malouf introduced the 4.5-mile 
"Making Strides Against Breast 
Cancer" walk, which will take place 
on Oct. 23 . Currently, the sororities 
have raised approximately $9,500 
for this charity event. 

Old Business 
Item P2 

An article in the proposed 
SRTV charter that forbade 
"graphic depictions of sexual 
activity involving nudity" was 
tabled indefinitely after the coun-
cil approved the internal com-
mittee's 9-0- I recommendation. 
This clause, which was originally 
included in the charter's general 
revisions (Item P), was made its 
own item after it became a subject 
of controversy at last week's coun-
cil caucus. 

Although there was a motion 
to pull the item from committee 
for further discussion, it failed in 
a 2-14-2 vote.

Regents worry about fiscal future 
Compact with governor to take effect this year 

ay JACLYH SHOW 
Staff Writer 

The fiscal future and over-
all quality of the University 
of California, despite budget 
increases over the past year, is 
still in jeopardy, several regents 
said at a meeting last month . 

While there have been 
no recent cuts to funding, the 
regents expressed worry about 
problems stemming from financ-
ing in the 10 campuses. 

"This isn't a new issue, this 
is something we've been dealing 
with over the past several years," 
sa id Ravi Poorsina , a spokes-
woman for the UC Office of the 
President. "I don 't think there 
i one easy solution to solve the 
budget crisis." 

Regents at the meeting pre-
sented a report highlighting 
the consequences of state bud-
get cuts since 2000, including 
low faculty salaries, inadequate 
maintenance, few new structures 
and a rising teacher-to-student 
ratio. Despite the regents' con-
cern about financial difficulties, 
spending at the state level has 
increased, according to state 
Department of Finance spokes-
man H.D. Palmer. 

"This year's budget increased 
UC's spending about 3 percent, 
or about S80 million," he said. 
"It also increased the enrollment 
budget by about [2.5J percent. 
So there are additional resources 
that are being provided." 

The increases still do not 
bring spending to the level of 
four years ago, when a string 
of budget downsizing that has 
left the university with IS per-
cent less general state funding 

since 200 I, despite a 19-percent 
increase in students. Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger signed a com-
pact in spring 2004 with UC 
President Robert C. Dynes in 
an effort to limit the cuts and 
create caps on raising tuition. 
The university should experience 
the compact's effects this year, 
Poorsina said. 

"We have the compact with 
the governor's office which out-

" We definitely rely 
heavily on the state 

budget, which is why 
you've seen budget crises 
for the past several years 

as weU as for the state 
as a whole . " 
- Ravi PoorsinI. 

uc otC';:m-~ 
lines the increases and provides a 
little framework around funding 
and stopping the bleeding, basi-
cally which this is the first year 
this is actually starting to hap-
pen," she said. 

The state Department of 
Finance expects the compact to 
provide a foreseeable rate of fee 
increases, not exceeding 8 per-
cent a year. 

Compared to the 4O-percent 
jump over two years that students 
were experiencing a few years 
ago, the compact offers students 

and their parents predictability, 
according to Palmer. 

Despite the compact, the 
student-to-faculty ratio is still 
approximately 20 to I, instead 
of the goal of less than 18 to I, 
a ratio the regents has said they 
will maintain . Faculty salaries 
now lag behind wages at private 
schools, according to Poorsina . 

Regents, as part of the com-
pact, are also trying to cut costs 
internally by scrutinizing opera-
tions to increase effi ciency, 
Poorsina said. 

The regents have to report to 
the state on how they are meet-
ing the benchmarks et up to 
moni [Or thei r progress in di ffer-

"We definitely rely heavily on

can't really rebound back in one

Time nears for state to 
revisit higher ed plan 

N osta lgia and long-ing for the good old days make for bad 
publi~ policy. The S,lme is 
true for the sta te's 45-year-
old Master Plan for Higher 
Education. 

Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger's decision 
last month to extend the 
authority of the California 
State Un iversity tissue 
doctorate degrees in educa-
tion has put the final nails 
into the coffin of the old 
relic, and the ooner UC 
administrators acquiesce 
on this point, the sooner 
Californians can have an 
honest debate about a new 
higher education blueprint, 
one that serves a 21 st cen-
tury California. 

Unlike the original, a new 
plan must be more than a 
political peace treaty that 
relies on arbittiuy quotas and 
provisions. Whether in the 
case of enrollment limits or 
state funding, a new docu-
ment must be a rational prod-

uct of educated debate, with 
flexibiuty to adjust with age a 
its predecessor never could. 

Top UC brass are right 
to be worried; the univer-
sity made out like a ban-
dit in 1960, and they real-
ize that any revisions would 
likely come at a price. But to 
assume that clinging to the 
1960 document will avert its 
further erosion i both silly 
and untenable. 

In truth, both the gov-
ernor and legislators have 
proven willing to unilater-
ally change the state's poli-
cies toward its universities 
on issues ranging from 
annual appropriations to the 
most recent doctoral deba-
cle. Agreeing to revisit the 
Master Plan would bring the 
debate into the open, allow-
ing for truly pluralistic dis-
cussion that ends in a docu-
ment with both the legiti-
macy and meaning that our 
current plan sorely lacks. 

Whether they like it or 
not, UC campuses have no 

Loyalty oaths wrong 
solution in A.S. appts 

W hen the 2004 deba-cle involving the A.S. Cowlcil's rep-
resen ta tive to the Registr:! tion 
Fee Advisory Comm.ittee had 
cleared, fallout was inevita-
ble. New committee mem-
ber applicants are now settled 
with the consequences. 

[t started when a fonner 
A.S. representative to RFAC 
refused to play ball with the 
council 's wishes in spring 
2004. In direct response, the 
council now requires stu-
dent representatives chosen 
to speak on behalf of the stu-
dent body on campuswide 
committees to swear that 
they will obey the student 
government's wishes. 

In essence, the move turns 
the position into a talking 
head for the council, margin-
aljzing its important role as 
the voice of students. While 
the representatives are sup-
posed speak on behalf of 
the student body, they now 
are accountable to the A.S. 
Council alone. Appointees 
are picked to represent all 
students, even the 80 percent 

of whom don't bother to vote 
in the election of the A.S. 
Council; should the council 
decide to endorse an en·o-
neous path, appointees now 
have no leverage to act in 
the best interest of students, 
including that 80 percent. 

The benefit of representa-
tives is their ability to special-
ize in their field of expertise. 
But having the council over-
ruJe their discretion through 
edicts challenges the very 
purpose of having specialized 
individuals oversee the busi-
ness of each committee. 

Requiring an oath is too 
extreme a measure. Rather, 
the problem lies with the 
selection process, which 
should be more in-depth 
and thorough. The origi-
nal problem was the per-
son appointed by the A.S. 
Council in 2004, and having 
an oath does little to assure 
that future appointees are 
more qualified. A represen-
tative on committees can 
offer a surfeit of ideas and 
expertise, which is a goal too 
valuable to stifle with oaths.

Notification initiative would not 
violate minors' right to abortions 

By HANNA CAMP 
Associate Opinion Editor 

For years, Califomia's history 
with abortion legislation has been a 
rug-of-war between the legislature, 
the courts and popular opinion. 
We had a Therapeutic Abortion 
Act six years before Roe v. Wilde, 
a state Supreme Court ruli ng that 
a woman had a right to choose to 
have an abortion twO years after 
that and, another two years later, a 
ruling that a minor had that sa me 
right, reg.rdless of her dependency 
stanIs. In 1987, the Legislarure 
enacted a "parental consent" law, 
requiring that a minor seeking an 
abortion first obtain the permission 
of a parent or a judge. That law, 
after being tied up in the courts 
for a decade was finally declared 
unconstitutional by the California 
Supreme Court. ow the issue is 
back in a milder package for this 
November's statewide election. 

Proposition 73 is what is known 
as a "parental notification" law, 
which does not require the consent 
of the parents of a minor seeking 
an abortion, but stipulates that at 
least one parent must be notified at 
least 48 hours befure the procedure 
is done. The initiative was expected 
to receive a lot more attention than 
it has, but whether or not it passes 
will not be a function of which 
side shouts the loudest. It won't 
even be a function of how many 
pro-life voters versus how many 
pro-choice voters there currently 
arc in Califurnia. It will be a func-
tion of how many pro-choice vot-
ers feel that parental notifiClltion 

is the most reasonable restriction 
possible on the troubling issue of 
underage abortions. 

Current polls indiClltc that a 
plurality of voters - 48 percent 
- favor the bill, and there's no 
statistic anywhere indiCllting that 
California's proportion of staunch 
pro-I ifers is even close to 48 per-
cem. In fdct, the pro-choice major-
ity in this state, as in other states, 
is largely united in disapproval of 
parental consent laws, but there is 

significant split when it comes 

" There is a TllltUral and 
entirely justified view that 
parents should be notified 

when their child is 
in any danger, " 

to parental notification. A size-
able faction comes down, rightly, 
in favor of the law. 

Pro-choice people are gener-
ally leery of allowing the govern-
ment to dictate when and where 
an abortion is the proper choice, 
just as they are leery of allowing 
the government to interfere in any 
adult medical decision. But while 
the definition of a minor varies 
from state to state, their rights 
have always been recognized as 
more limited than those of adults. 
They cannot vote, drink, smoke 
or join the military, and when they 

enter a health care fucility, they 
cannot demand that administrators 
not contact their parents. There is 
a narural and entirel)' justified view 
that parents should be notified 
when thcir child is in any danger. 
The parents bear ultimate respon-
sibi li ty for an underage child, and 
it's important that they know the 
relevant infonnation in any furure 
hcalth care decisions.' 

More than that, an unemanci-
pated minor is in all likelihood still 
living with her parents, and while 
statistics consistently show that all 
abortion is a safer procedure than a 
live birth, complications sometimes 
happen, and it is those living with 
the minor who need to be watchful 
of any problems. It's common for 
a friend, boyfriend or spouse to be 
told to be on the lookout for com-
plications in an adult woman. A 
minor needs that kind of attention 
even more than an adult 

Opponents of Proposition 73 
have given many well-intentioned 
reasons for why the measure should 
be rejected. Most of them hinge 
upon "what-ifs." What if a girl is 
in an abusive home? What if she 
obtains an illegal abortion f2ther 
than tell her parents? Presumably 
those girls who have a good rela-
tionship with their parents will tell 
them without being forced to, so 
will this biD really help the girls 
who need it? 

Proposition 73, like many simi-
lar biDs enacted in other states, 
attempts to provide an option by 
including a judicial-bypass clause,

The Roam 
& Ramble 
Maryann Kimoto 

I t's only the second week of the quarter, and already, I feel the strain. Contrasted ag.inst 
the idyllic Welcome Week and 
the easy-going introductions, hel-
lo and whatnot of fir t week, I'm 
finally settling into a haphazard 
schedule of sorts, the terrifying sort 
that will in all likelihood follow me 
until the end of the quarter. Am 
I afraid of commitment? Yes, and 
losing the ability to add classes 
with impunity this Friday screams 
of finality. But, as a dying ma~ 
may dream of an oasis amongst the 
dunes, so I peruse the class sched-
ule, the job listings, the news ... in 
an attempt to flit from one dreamy 
possibility to another with some 
semblance of freedom. 

And what a world it is out there. 
There are times when ] think my 
near-claustrophobic fear of miss-
ing out keeps my mind rather weU 
equipped as to the goings-on of 
the world. It certainly adds color 
to my life. 

For instance, should J be seen 
contemplating hard drives with a 
certain bitterness, it will have been 
because 30gigs.com, like the beta 
version ofGmail and the over-hyped 
Orlrut community, is free space and 
mail that I can't get due to "invita-
tion only" policies. If, by chance, ] 
pass you sometime toda), and begin 
to make funny, hiccupping sounds 

at the cigarette dangling from your 
fingers, fear not. [[ isn'r because my 
lungs are overly fond of collapsing 
at even the hint of dust, or out of 
some sadistic joy that ),ou had to run 
off 20 feet or so from a building in 
order to sate the nicotinc cravings 
(though both are quite true under 
nonnal circumstances), but because 
r will have remembered fondly that 
"Ai Ai," the smoking chimpanzee, 
needed fried dumplings and a walk-
man ro completely kick the habit. 
Both of which, r can now proudl), 
say, I own. 

The dumplings are nice, but 
it's the MP3 player that [ adore. 
vVhy rave over a bit of colored 
plastic and circuits? A couple of 
reasons, acrually. One, it's nor an 
infamous iPod - do I need to pay 
someone to say that? - and two, it 
reintroduced me to that extensive, 
mysterious and alluringly danger-
ous world of online shopping. 

While not exactly a newbie to 
the bene.fits and pitfalls of shop-
ping on the Internet, I had alwa)'s 
held a calm, fastidious rationale 
when it came to brealcing out the 
credit card, and with good reason. ] 
didn't own one. Every time J need-
ed something desperately that only 
a bit of plastic and an American 
Express, Visa, Mastercard emblem 
couJd ger me, there was the rirual 
of calling home to request the usage 
of the fumily card number. 

Running every single purchase 
through my parents, thrifty as 
it would have been for my own 
finances, did not strike me as 
very practica I, and the phase soon 
passed, as I became better acquaint-
ed with bussing myself to stores 

with m)' handy-dandy checkbook 
and free bus sticker whenever the 
need arose. I suppose I could have 
gotten myself a card, but paying 
fees for spending my own money 
had always struck me as ridiculous. 

However, with the relatively 
new advent of the check card, r 
became a lost soul. I had struggled 
with the logic of it for three years, 
but in the end, r succumbed a few 
weeks ago and have since been 
searching the Web with a gusto 

" After all, why waste my 
precious time hunting 

dmm hrick-and-m.ortar 
stares when I can have a 

box shipped to my 
doorstep from across 

the world?" 

for deals unprecedented by my for-
mer, ad-blocking, freeware-down-
loading and Firefox-tabbing self. 
After all, why waste my precious 
time hunting down brick-and-mor-
tar stores when I can have a box 
shipped to m)' doorstep from across 
the world? 

EBay. Amazon. Some online 
storefront that a dedicated defraud-
er tracked down to a rundown 
garage in New York City. Each 
now held their very own brand of 

indelible charm that only incred-
ible savings could have mustered 
forth ... that is, until I aerually 
purchased things, of course. I think 
I spent more time this week search-
ing through ads and reviews, rant-
ing on various roll-free numbers, 
composing desperate manufacrur-
er-addressed e-mails and writing 
forum posts of outright defamation 
than all the time spent in class, 
srudying and working combined. ] 
love my newl), shipped MP3 player 
not out of any misguided sense of 
ease and accessibility, but more o r 
less because I have the feeling I 
earned it. eedles to say, the craze 
that once gripped my bod)' (a nd my 
dwindling bank account) is gone. 

Onc thing [ noticed immedi-
ately during that fiasco was that, in 
a store without displays, interaction 
or, at times, even a truthful account 
of what it i you ' re attempting to 
buy, reviews become tile lifeblood 
of the average consumer. CNET is 
my personal addiction, incorporatcd 
into the growing protocol of Web-
savvy tidbits r have collected and 
have come to regard with growing 
confidence. But the need for all this 
scrutiny troubles me at times. 

This want for a verification 
checldist is a reminder of the times. 
The Tt here at UCSD, once manna 
to a hungry mind and gaming spirit, 
has, over the past few years, become 
a thing to fear. Fraud, trojans (not 
including the USC variety), com-
puter viruses and that annoying 
thing with the foreign bank account 
and various Web site recommen-
dations ... not even an AIM pro-
file is immune from the threat of 
"Someone with an Internet con-

nection. " While this entity derives 
joy in rurning my laprop into a 
sparkler, or in a sauJting my screen 
witll porno ads, even this damage 
can be surpassed by an even larger 
threat - that of Many Someones. 
Roaming tile Nct and legal system in 
packs, lawsui ts, copyright infringe-
ments and "the RIAA" have become 
the horror stories wi th \Vh ich pa r-
ents scold their children. Ah, and 
back in my day, it was the threa t of 
being shipped off to a third world 
country th.at did the trick. I now 
know people who fear to lend out 
a CD simply because the recording 
industry has discovered an insatiable 
appetite for college srudenrs. 

In a world of confusion, lawyers 
and an overabundance of Britney 
Spears songs that seem to have been 
not-so-covertly downloaded by 
would-be anonymous [p addresses, 
music groups like Harvey Danger arc 
attempting to challenge the concept 
of jailbait music. Offering free down-
loads of their entire albwn a few 
tracks at a time, they are reminiscent 
of a time before mp3.com WlI shut 
down in 2000 ... before Napster 
turned into a subscription-based ser-
vice and MetaUiC'd became a curse 
word to a bevy of music addicts. 
Disheartening as the misrrust is, the 
strangest bit of information i that 
music downloaders have been shown 
by studies to be that nifty sector of 
the population that spends the mo t 
money on music. 

As for me, [ am satisfied with 
my radio, my modest CD collec-
tion and being a careful consumer 
in a world that's after my wallet.

Abortion: Rules regarding minors are sound 
continued from page 4 

which allows the girl to obtain an 
abortion without parental notifica-
tion, if she can demonstrate that 
she is mature enough to make the 
decision in a confidential hearing 
with a fdmily court judge. Crities 
are right to point out that the pro-
cess is not an easy one, and an issue 
this time-sensitive is terribly vul-
nerable to the notorious delays of 
the judicial process. But minors can 
and have obtained judicial bypasses 
when they can prove that they are 
mature and understand the decision 
they are making. It should certainly 
be an easier process, but those who 
have serious reasons for not telling 
their parents do have an out. 

The simple fact is that, absent 
such a reason, a parental notifica-
tion law does not viola te the minor's 
rights. She retains the right to the 
final decision, as she weU should. 
The parents may beg, plead or 
threaten to their hearts' content, 
but the choice is stiU hers. Every 
abortion is an individual choice, 
and some are going to be made in 
more difficult situations than others. 
While this may sound cruel, it's not 
the government'S job to shield young

girls from their parents' anger or 
disappointment, unless they pose a 
serious physical or mental threat to 
her. Abortion is a unique situation, 
but not so unique that it means aU 
normal rules of procedure in treat-
ing minors should be thrown out. 

The law can't make dysfunc-
tional families talk, and it doesn' t 
pretend to. But the fact that a minor 
wants to avoid telling Mom and 
Dad isn't 3 signal of a dysfunctional 
home, it's a natural reaction from 
a young pcrson who knows she's 
about to disappoint her parents. 

Som~ minors simply made a mis-
take and are dealing with it, others 
truly need help and refuse to ask for 
it. There are a few treatments that 
a minor can consent to and have it 
remain confidential, including STD 
trcaOllcnt. But surgical procedures 
are an enitrely differenr ballgame; 
an abortion is an important medi-
cal decision, and parents need to 
know. 

The claims from supporters of 
Proposition 73 that abortion rates 
will decrease are baloney. Not only 
have numerous courts and a study 
by a conservative think-tank con-
cluded that this isn't the case, but 

as we all know, young kids rarely 
Stop to check the abortion statutes 
in their district before getting it on. 
Moreover, the disingenuous rhetO-
ric about making sure young girls 
have their mommies and daddies 
by their side is difficult to stomach 
from staunch pro-life supporters. 
Clearly, they don't want that at all; 
they want mommy and daddy to 
find a way to stOp their daughter 
from going through with it. It's their 
belief that abortion is pure murder 
and cannot be justified, and that's 
fine , but it's a view the majority of 
Californians don 't share. 

Lnstead, many Calitomians rec-
ognize that, while a government 
cannot rightly declare that the rights 
of the fetus trump the rights of the 
woman, it is correct in declaring that 
the right of a parent to know what 
health care their child is receiving is 
almost inviolable. In the end, the dif-
ference between pro-choice voters 
on this issue boils down to the dif-
ference between those who believe 
that an abortion should be available 
completely unhindered, and those 
who believe that certain restrictions 
are reasonable. Proposition 73 is a 
reasonable restriction.

To cut costs, the Student Center design 
scrapped original plans for separate buildings, 
and consolidated them into one structure, 
Ratcliff said. Price Center has faced similar 
challenges, forcing engineers to consider struc-
tural and mechanical alternatives such as using 
less steel and making more intrusive designs. 

The expansion's second phase, scheduled 
to begin next spring, will include improve-
ments to Snldent Center and expansion of 
Groundwork Books, the General StOre Co-
op, the Food Co-op and the bike shop. A 39 
quarterly referendum fee approved by students 
in 2003 pays for the second phase, accordi ng 
to Ratcl iff. 

When fully completed, the project will have 
bui lt multiple faci lities, including a 24-hour 

study lounge with a computer lab, group-study 
rooms and commuter student resources, late-
night restaurants and cafes and 84 additional 
student organization offices as well as a student 
organiza tion resource cen ter. 

The University Centers Advisory Board 
chose the cuisine type through feedback from 
students, faculty and staff, according to John 
Muir Coll ege alumnus and former UCAB 
representative Jeremy Cogan. 

After receiving a variety of of propos-
als, which included representatives evaluating 
menus, prices and sampling the restaurant's

some universities were dragging their feet in 
combating illegal downloading. 

"Any initiative that helps shed light on 
this important issue is positive," she said, 
pointing to a recent joint report released 
by the entertainment industry and higher 
education community as a model for coop-
erative action. 

While the report widely praised universi-
ties for promoting legal alternatives to piracy, 
it concluded that "many schools unfonu-
nately have yie.lded to complacency in their 
methods of addressing piracy on campus." 

Wood said UCSD would continue to 
buck RIAA demands that it and all other 
universities restrict student access to peer-
to-peer software, which the industry group 
has argued allows for illegal sharing to take 
place. 

"We obviously have stayed away from 

more aggressive censoring and we will con-
tinue to do that," he said. "We've taken the 
position that, in and of itself, peer-to-peer 
software is not illegal. And we've tried to do 
some educational steps to let people know 
that the movement of copyrighted works is 
illegal." 

In addition, Wood said that lawmakers 
would likely face difficult challenges if they 
attempt to use the findings from the GAO 
study to craft new legal restrictions. 

"I think it would be difficult for a regulator 
[0 write laws that went beyond the banning of 
exchange of copyrighted materials that didn 't 
also restrict certain types of software that are 
known to be in use by the research commu-
nity," he said. 

The eight new filings have come as part of 
record companies' most recent round of suits 
against 757 individuals, including students at 
UC Berkeley and UCLA. The RlAA has said 
that most of the VCSD students charged last 
spring have chosen to settle out of court.

SRTV: A.S. Council regulation of 
station content is legal, Ratcliff says 

continued from page I 
example, to have the content be about news 
of campus developments, then i[ has complete 
latitude to do so. If A.S. decided that there 
should be no SR'TV tOmortow, it could. It is 
not a violation of student policy or state law." 

Junious drafted a proposal that the coun-
cil be entitled to vote in the case the station 
breached its chaner, which was approved. 
The changes to the document are necessary 
to establish a clear understanding of what is 
allowed to air, Ratcliff said. 

"You should be very surgical about cltang-
ing the charter," he said. "Once you set the 
rules and regulations when it comes to con-
tent, you have to administer it and uphold 
those rules and regulations. But by being 
specific, the staff who are -programming for 
SRTV know very clearly what's not allowed." 

Other legal experts believed the A.S. 
Council did not have the right to regulate 
content, even though it directly funds SRTV. 

"Just because the council might provide 
some of the funds, in a public school context 
the power of the purse doesn 't translate to 
what the content of that forum is," said Mike 
Hiestand, an attorney at the Student Press Law 
Center. "This is clearly content-motivated and 
there is no way the courts would uphold such 
amendments. Even if they are taking student 
activity fees, they're perfonning a government 
function by doling out those funds to the sta-
tion. So just funding a media source doesn't 
give them the right to control content." 

Because there is no stipulation on the stu-
dent activity fees that the A.S. Council uses 
to fund SRTY, it may change the chaner as it 
pleases, Ratcliff said, prior to the vote. 

"The fee is delegated to me A.S. O:>uncil, 
and there!; no prescription associated with that 
amount of money," he said. "1l1ere was no line 
when the fee was made that said that the coun-
cil could not regulate content of the station. II 

The move to ban instances of sexual activ-
ity involving nudity at all times may be a bit 

extreme, according to Thomas R. Burke, a 
lawyer specializing in media law. 

"Anytime there is a change in who is 
responsible for content and the kind of edi-
torial content in a limited public forum, it 
is important to make sure the community 
agrees with direction it's headed," he said. 
"The language suggests that it completely 
forbids any sexual nudity at any time in any 
way. Thats inconsistent with what viewership 
would expect on certain occasions, since there 
are times that nudity is important in a storyline 
or vital to expression. If [the council] is react-
ing to one particular instance, you would think 
that they could address that in one way instead 
of a sweeping change. " 

Currently, SRTV's charter is permissive 
when compared to other coUeges, Ratcliff said, 
some of which prohibit aU indecent material. 
A review process should be established to 
ensure that shows are within guidelines stated 
in the stations charter, according to Ratcliff. 

"If you look at SRTV's charter, it does not 
outline the procedures for reviewing programs 
before they are aired," he said. "This should 
be addressed because this is the most common 
approach that coUege television stations use 
to make sure that only programs that comply 
with their rules and regulations are aired." 

Legal action has always been a last resort, 
according to Tess. Although SR1V as an 
entity cannot file any lawsuits, Tess said he 
knows many individual SRTV members who 
were willing to take legal action if the council 
had approved the ban on graphic nudity. 

"My personal goal in this whole situation 
since last year was [0 keep it out of the admin-
istration's hands and have the issue involve 
students only," Tess said. "1 know of the legal 
options, but [ call that the big red button that 
says, 'Do not push.' But eventually, somebody 
always pusbes it."

50 IaMIy: OJ Qui~ a rapper, producer and DJ with roots in the early '90s gangsta rap scene, released 
his newest album, 7i'ouma, earlier this year. He will perform on Oct 7 at this year's Fall Fest 

By ADAM STALEY 
Senior Staff Writer 

Over the past three years, UCSD's free festivals (FallFest, Winter Fest, and Sun God) were dominated by young-
er acts such as Blackalicious, Jurassic 
5, People Under the Stairs and TaUb 
Kweli. Recently, however, it would seem 
that our university is trying to school 
us on some older hip-hop with KRS-
One, Busta Rhymes and, at this week's 
FallFest, West Coast legend and pioneer 
OJ Quiic. 

T he multitalented DJ Quik, who 
writes, produces and raps, has been on 
the hip-hop scene since his 1991 debut, 
Qt,;/c is the Name. West Coast gangsta rap 
was dominating hip-hop at the time, and 
Quik, an L.A. County native who grew up 
around Dr. Dre, Ice Cube and MC Eiht, 
was immediately embraced by critics and 
the streets a Like. 

However, following the deaths ofTupac 
and Biggie, gangsta rap became somewhat 

9 

frowned upon, and any sense of solidarity 
among West Coast artists soon dissolved . 

Although most of Quik's subsequent 
releases were deemed disappointing-to-
disastrous, he was able to keep his name 
in hip-hop circles through his produc-
tion talents, crafting hits for Kurupt, 
Truth Hurts, and, most notably, Jay-Z 
with "Can't Go Wrong," "Addictive" and 
"Justify My Thug," respectively. 

Quilc's 21st century has been anything 
but smooth sailing, including a motor-
cycle accident in 2000 and an accusation 
of assau lting and beating his own sister in 
2003 . His last re lease, Under the Influence, 
didn 't achieve much success, and was 
quickJy forgotten. Never one to quit, DJ 
Quik is now attempting to resurrect hi~ 
career late in the game with last month 's 
release of Trauma , and this weekend he 
rolls into RIM C Arena with the task 
of riling up what will probably turn out 
to be a mosLly punk crowd at t1,i s ye~ r's 
Fall Fest. Welcome to CSO Mr. Quik, 
and good luck!

If you've even heard of Cage, you might know him as the white guy with the high-pitched voice and 
violent rhymes who isn't named 
Marshall. Cage, however, has been 
in the game si nce 1993, and previ-
ous albums such as Movier fo1' the 
Blind have built quite an under-
ground cult following for the sto-
rytelling Me. 

On Hell's Winter, Cage strays 
from his usual style and releases a 
more introspective album, allowing 
the listener to see the inner work-
ings of this eccentric artist. Cage 
reveals that his father was a drug 
addict, and his stories on "Too 
Heavy For Cherubs" and "Stripes" 
make Erninem's mother from 
"Cleanin' Out . My Clos\!t" seem 
like a responsible parent. Cage's 
aggression extends far beyond 
his nuclear family on tracks like 

Cqe 
Hell's Winter 
Definitive Jux 

**** "Grand '01 Party Crash," a five-
minute-long, DJ Shadow-produced 
diss on G-Dub and his administra-
tion, and "Scenester," an attack on 
self-absorbed females who are "the 
model type but never becomes a 
model." 

Cage is truly one of the better 
storytellers on the mic, but if that 
isn ' t enough, the production on 
Hell's Winte1' provides some of the 
more original and unique musical 
compositions seen in recent hip-
hop. RjD2, EI-P and Blockhead 
all make outstanding contribu-
tions, creating an album with 
great diversity, yet maintaining a 
cohesive, haunting tone through-
out due to Cage's powerful, emo-
tional narration.

A full six years after clogging review pages with a 90-word album titl e, Fiona Apple still

Perhaps The Weight is a Gift should have been the title for ada Surf's far-off reunion 
record, when it could explain the 
likely love handles. Perhaps it could 
have been an acoustic record, where 
vocalist Matthew Caws' insistent 
self-indulgence would be expect-
ed. Unfortunately, the first-person 
diary drool t1l3t wrinkles the once-
nOlorious indi e- rocker's fourth

morc Dr. Phil than \1 ick J agger, 
even though the ;ong~ thermclves

The Weight is a Gift

It's Caws' lyrics more than any-
thing that make The Weight such a 
snicker. J Ie dons the preacher's robe 
on quite a few numbers, announc-
ing, "Always love/ hate will get 
you every time" on "Always Love." 
The refrain in "Concrete Bcd" is 
possibly worse: "To find someone 
you love, you gotta be someone 
you love." Did this guy get born 
again? Or did he just read toO much 
Deepak Chopra? 

If you can get past the chee e, 
th e ada boys rock it more or less 
on par. Their production is lushly 
transparent, sucking every drop 
of color from the textbook gui-
ta rlbassldrum arrangements. ot 
a wink of originali ty on the whole 
thing, but for seekers of melodic, 
introspective indie rock, it probably 
doesn't matter.

Old Globe's latest isn't for kids these days 
Pedophilia and the priesthood given an outdated treatment 

By OAKLEY ANDERSON-
MOORE 

Senior Staff Writer 

To examine "the complicity of the C hurch's hierarchy in pro-tecting and perpetuating the 
sick and sinful actions" of recent 
sex-abuse scandals is the author's! 
actor's stated point of the new 
Old Globe play "Prince of L.A." 
Probing the corruption of the most 
powerful religious institution in 
We tern civilization sounds like 
potentially great material for a play 
that could stir up orne world-
shaking thought. So when arriving 
at the theater to find the "inves-
tigation of corruption" Ie s like a 
fresh contemplation and more like 
listening to grandpa's views on life 
at the dinner table in between "kids 
these days" and "pass the mashed 
potatoes," this writer was quite dis-
appointed. 

In fact, about 90 percent of the 
audience seemed ' to be over 65, 
complete with a snoring Grandpa 
Yankel type next to me who had 
to be gently woken by the u her. 

ow, of course the aged are full 
of earned wisdom - which youth 
like myself must always appreci-
ate. But in this ca e, the sagacity 
behind the production of "Prince 
of L.A." was not the tool needed 
to slice open and shed light on 
the corruptions of the Ca tholic 
Church. 

Dakin Matthews, the author, 
who also plays Matthew Cardinal 
John in the show, is an aging asso-
ciate artist for the Old Globe who 
also happened to study to be a 
priest years ago. The closeness of 
the authorlactor to the material 
brings in an intimate knowledge 
of the working of the Catholic 

Church - however, it's proba-
bly this closeness that makes the 
play so stale. Most of the time is 
spent showing the human side of 
the different people involved in a 
fictionalized sex-abuse scanda l. At 
multiple moments, Cardinal John 
shows his confusion and iterates, 
"How could this have happened?" 
Despite lukewarm diatribes about 
women in the clergy, the disparity 
between concepts of "truth," and 
how no scriptures ever mention 
"legalized abortion," the end of the 
play leaves us with the creeping 
realization that Matthews himself 

Theater 
REVIEW 

really just can't figure out "how this 
could have happened" either. 

A lot of attention (and humor-
ous interlude) is given to the foi-
bles of clergy dealing with the 
inevitable presence of gay clergy, 
so much so that Matthews seems

.'In Her Shoes' adaptation kicks life 
back into the chick flick genre 

By ANN 5HEN 
Senior Staff Writer 

Thank God feel-good female films are back on the silver creen. After 
what seems like a decade of 
haphazardly strewn-together 
scripts attached to pretty, 
genial actors filling female 
film quotas at studios, this 
year has finally brought 
something substantial to 
cushion our tears. Adapted 
fromJennifer Weiner's novel 
"lll Her Shoes," the film 
of the same name explores 
an intellectual, thoughtful 
understanding of family rela-
tionships and single women. 
Director Curtis Han on ("8 
Mile", "L.A. Confidential") 
brings a darker, sharper edge 
to what would have other-
wise been a standa rd ch ick 
flick (how 1 hate that term). 
Missing is the cheesy light-
ing and trite dialogue of the 
genre; instead the audience 
is submerged in the softer, 
darker reality of rclation-
ships, family and skeletons 
in the closeL

Toni Collette ("Muriel's 
Wedding") as Rose Feller, 
a straight-laced, complex-
laden lawyer who is knocked 
off course over and over 

a~ain by her free-spin-
nmg, dyslexic-but-charm-
ing younger sister Maggie, 
played by Cameron Diaz. 

"In Her Shoes" reaches 
the zen of comedy and drama 
when the scene slyly shifts 
from dull Philadelphia into 
pastel-candy-mint Florida. 
Maggie arrives on the door-
step of their long lost grand-
mother, Ella Hirsh (bril-
liantly played with strength 
and subtlety by Shirley 
MacLaine), setting out to 
live with Ella after being 
kicked off of Rosc's couch 
and unwittingly unfurling 
the mysterious history of 
their mother's death. 

Ella's charming neigh-
bors in u a retirement com-
munity for active seniors" 
are portrayed by a slew 
of skilled comedic actors, 
providing an alanning par-
allel between the sisters 
and their friends and Ella 
and her friends. To break 
the awkward foreignness 
between E lla and Maggie in 
their initial time together, 
Ella's friends suggest get-
ting cable for "Sex and the 
City," leading to a poignant 
and hilarious scene involv-
ing cosmopolitans, a mono-
logue on anal sex and old

people. 
Luckily, most of the male-

female relationship romances 
are kept low key, focusing the 
piece on family relationships 
and understanding the ugly 
past in order to make sense 
of the maddening present. 

Rose and Maggie's 
individual chemistry is 
starkJy different, 0 their 
joint scenes seem to fall 
flat of expected chemis-
try between sisters. It was 
hard to believe they were 
ever related, because the 
moments establishing con-
nection were so short lived. 
But the moments on their 
individual journeys that 
take them through growth 
show them as deep charac-
ters that can fit together in 
a puzzling sisterhood. 

Don't come expecting it 
to be anything other than 
what it is, which is a film 
prepared for an audience of 
women and the people who 
love them. But do expect it 
to exceed all expectations set 
by the previous trend of rela-
tionship dramas, ami to be 
entranced by the charmingly 
flawed characters who dare 
to e,.plore their humanness. 
Also see it if you love funny 
old people.

Sister Kt: Toni Collette and Cameron Diaz play feuding sisters in Curtis Hanson's treatment of the best-selling

prevalence of gay clergy. 
Matthews would have 
done us more justice if he 
addressed, for examp le, 
the role of the Church in 
today's 60ciety and how 
it fostered the shielding 
of criminal priests from

the Catholic Church being

seems to fit with the show 
tagline that it's "achingly

Benefit: Show to help some poor 
artists made poorer by Katrina 

continued from page 9 
approach to 3n, it would be an understate-
ment to dub Quintron and Miss Pussycat 
"struggling artists." With the destruction of 
their home, their studio for building their 
instrumentli, puppets and various projects is 
long gone. 

Dan Wise, guitarist of Kill Me Tomorrow, 
got pissed about it one day. With benefit 
shows popping up everywhere, why isn't 
there one for Quintron and Miss Pussycat? 
Of course, the solution to the problem, as all 
dlings in underground rock, is to do it you r-
elf. Being the guitarist for the successful trio, 
Dan put his DiY skills to work and organized 
a benefit show with the help of the Che Cafe. 
Unfortunately for Dan, that same night, 
UCSD hostli the annual FaliFest. 

This won't slow down Wi e though. 
While disappointed that more bands are 
not contributing to various benefit shows 
throughout the country, he has decided to 
organize the even t. 

Kill Me Tomorrow is one of San Diego's 
best-kept secrets. While Blink- 182 imitators 
shred the credibility of the city'S fragi le music 
scene, KMT injects the town with mega 
doses of creativity it desperately needs. The 
trio of Dan Wise, Zack Wentz and K8 Wentz 
perfonn dark no-wave song'S that are usually 
noisy, yet highly rhythmic and danceable. 

KMT is a band that every San Diegan should 
mow and take pride in. 

T heir latest record, The Garbagmlll1l 
(lnd the Prostitute, is critically acclaimed, and 
twists guitar noise and electronics together 
into musical bliss. Tn addition, Zack Wentz 
is an electronic percussioni t whose live per-
fonnanee is visual art in itself. According too 
Wise, a new KMT record is in the works. 

My Sexual Dad, the slick moniker that 
confronts our awkward realities, is a promis-
ing band. Songs such as "Take th e Cartridge 
Out and Blow It" are signals that MSD 
intend to main tain the integrity of indie rock. 
With humanist tendencies, their efforts can 
help the benefit show. On the other end of 
the spectrum, Lipstick Terror, hailing from 
Mexico, is best described as a hybrid of 
electro-punk and hardcore. Lipstick Terror 
has big plans for playing more shows in 
Southern California, so you might as well do 
your homework and be fumiliar with dleir 
screams. Liqdzunshine (pronounced 'Liquid 
Sunshine') bring even more diversity to the 
lineup, producing new cutting edge hip-hop, 
injecting a needed blast of funk back into the 
fonnula. 

Ki ll Me Tomorrow, My Sexual Dad, 
Lipstick Terror and Liqdzunshine wi ll play 
at the Che Cafe at 8 p.m. on OCt. 7. Ticketli 
are $6. 

Courtesy 
VIVI Ia lipstick: Lipstick Terror will perform a blend of electro·punk, rock and dance in support of 
Quintron and Miss PussyCilt, who lost unique, homemade instruments to Hurricane Katrina.

founded in 2002 and has little histo-
ry at UCSD. According to Armour, 
the team has been slowly improv-
ing since its inaugural season and 
is always looking to expand the 
program. 

"When we first started four 
years ago, the team was below 
.500," Annour said. "The next year 
we were .500. Last year we were 
one of the top teams and this year 
expectations are to get Team A 
into Nationals and Team B into 
Regionals. So it has really grown 
every year." 

Getting there will require 
a lot of comminnent from the 
players, Annour said. This is no 
easy requirement to fill, as play-
ers must pay to play on the club 
team and commit to travel to tour-
naments in places such as Fort 
Collins, Colo., the host of last 
year's National Collegiate Roller 
Hock.ey Association Championship 
Tournament. 

"We need more commionent 
out of the A team players to get to 
Nationals," Armour said. "We got 
a big turnout, so hopefully we can 
pick up some quality skaters. With 
the B team, it's just a matter of the 
commitment to get everybody to 
show up to toumaments again." 

Tournament~ might not be a 
problem anymore after the nJrnout 
on the first night of tryouts. 

"We've gOt plenty of skaters and 
if we can run two B teams, that's 
great," Armour said. "That means 
we've gOt a big enough program 
to keep it going. It would be great 
to have at least one of them be 
realJy competitive and make it to 
Regionals. " 

Armour also has long-term goals 
for roller hockey at CSD. 

"If we can maint:lin a lot of the 
work, there will be more and more 
people coming out and there wilJ 
be more and more competition," 
Armour said. "If we are success-
ful for a couple years, we'd like to 
move up to Division [ and skate 
with the bigger schools." 

Although a move to Division-I 
doesn't seem to be in the near future, 
the team has some more immediate 
goals for the upcoming season. 

"We'd like to maintain one qual-
ity level A team and get enough 
skaters on to it where we have 
enough to really run lines fast 
enough like we need to," Armour 
said. "And if we can get two B teams 
running, that feeds into the A team 
the following year." 

Although they were only a third-
year team at UCSD, the Tritns 
pulled off some impressive wins 
over some big-name schools last 
season, including two blowout wins 
over the University of Southern 
California. The one school that no 
one seemed to be able to beat last 
year, Reno, is the team the Tritons 
have their sights set on. Despite 
their impressive finish, Reno 
remains a sizable roadblock. for the 
Tritons come tournament time. 

"Reno killed everybody at 
Nationals and they're back again 
and probably even a stronger 
team," Amtour said. "So they'll be 
the strongest team in the nation 
I'm sure." 

Right now, the team is still hold-
ing tryouts in order to assess who 
belongs in the Ijmited spots on the 
A team and who will play on the B 
team. However, one tournament 
is scheduled before the rosters are 
even to be released. The teams will 
tnIvel to the Anaheim Hockey Club 
on Oct. 22 to start the season and at 
the pace the program is going, they 
willioak to take an early lead .in the 
WCRHA standings. 

"We want to finjsh first in the 
west coast this year," senior capuin 
Thi Tran said.

Roller hockey program expanding 
Club team set to start fourth season at UCSD 

By RAEL ENTEEN 
Sports Editor 

As professional ice hockey pre-
pares to return to the rink after a 
yearlong absence, the UC D club 
roller hockey team is lacing up for 
its upcoming season after a trip 
to the National Collegiate Roller 
Hockey ociation Championship 
Tournament last year. 

The rolJer hockey team is actu-
ally made up of two to three differ-
ent team ,an team and at least 
one B team. All teams compete 
at tournaments against the same 
schools, but the A team faces other 
A teams and the B team face other 
B tcams. This sea on there could be 
enough players to create a second 
B tcam. 

T he A team is headed by soph-
omore player-coach Brian Keefe, 
who led the team to a second-place 
19-8-1 record last ~ea~on and to the 
West Coa ' t Roller Ilockey League 
Regional Championship, where 
the Triton lost to the defending 
champs, University of evada , 
Reno. 

Led by head coach Chris 
,\ rnlour, last yea r's B team wenr 
3- 13, but till had a strong enough 
sq uad to make it to Regional . 
I Jowever, a lack of players willing 
to travel to these tournaments left 
the Triton at a disadvantage during 
the playoffs . 

Last year's accomplishments 
were a surprise, as the team was

Summer stadium road trip 
rekindles fan's baseball fire 
cup 0' 
. Joe 

Joe Tevelowiu 

When classes began to fill with students in mid-September (or late 
August if you go to that crack 
whore-i n fested institution across 
the way) many were confronted 
with one simple, mundane and 
pointless question : "What did you 
do this summer?" Pointless, unless 
of course you're a Guardian sports 
writer who spent two weeks of 
hi urn mer traveling in a van to 
eight different baseball stadiums, 
fo rgoing air conditioning, exten-
sive human contact and, occasion-
ally (not often , but occasionally) 
showers. 

If this is the case, as it is for 
yours trul y, then the summer's 
expericnces and stories are very 
appropriate, especially as we come 
upon the baseball playoffs, one of 
the fOllr greatest times in a sports 
writer's year, next to the Super 
Bowl, BA Finals and when that 
drunken sailo r gOt beat down at 
t he Chargers game by guys wear-
ing skirts. 

T low does traveling to eight 
haseball stadiums in June relate 
() baseball in O ctober? As anyone 

who goes to a baseball game will 
te ll you, the action itself is not 
always riveting. And when you 
see seven consecutive games turn 
into blowouts before the sixth 
inning, you realize that two things 
are necessary: staying interested 
by keeping a scorecard and talk.-
ing. Sure, men aren't always the 
most social of creatures, but two 

guys who spend nearly $1,000 
realizing a childhood fantasy can 
become very conversational, espe-
cially when the topic is sports . 
And these conversations provide 
insight and analysis that becomes 
increasingly fun to revisit as the 
season wears on. 

During the trip, as my friend 
Gary and I scoreboard-watched 
our hometown Angels, the clos-
est team in their division was the 
Texas Rangers. I commented at 
one point on the impending divi-
ion battle: "l'm sure glad the A's 

are out of it this year." 
Later on, while watching the 

ationals beat down the very 
same Rangers, Gary remarked: 
"These guys are for real. They're 
in it for the long hauL" 

few da ys later, with the 
Baltimore Orioles visiting the 
Chicago White Sox, both Gary 
and I marveled at how Rafael 
Palmeiro was "as pure as apple 
pic." OK, tll e la t one was a lie, 
but, of course, you can see now 
just how the tables have turned . 

And yet, some things never 
change. While the beauty and 
majesty of Wrigley Field nearly 
made me wet myself, the de pair 
and disappointment of watching 
the Cubs get beat by two runs 
showed that lovable losers are still 
losers. 

On the other side of Chicago, 
we saw the Sox get a huge lead, let 
it slip, and still pull out the victo-
ry, without much dramatic fashion 
and plenty of generic play. 

In Kansas City we watched as 
Roger Clemens proved that at 42 
he's still as good a pitcher as Barry 
Bonds is a hitter, but without the 
steroids and bad attitude - or at

Cross country squads miss 
podium at Paul Short meet 
Hodgins and Lostrom lead Tritons to 
top-25 finish against D-I competition 

By LAUREN KAYO 
Contributing Writer 

Seniors Carl Lostrom and 
Mimi Hodgins flew across the fin-
ish line for the UCSD men's and 
women's cross country teams at 
the 32nd Paul Short Invitational 
on Oct. I to help the Triton teams 
finish 24th out of 44 and II th out 
of 47 teams, respectively. 

Both teams had solid outings 
against stiff competition at the 
meet in Bethlehem, Pa., where 
Leigh University played host at its 
Goodman course to teams from 
predominantly NCAA Division I 
schools. 

In the women's 6k race, the No. 
12 Triton were led by IIodgins, 
who raced across the line to place 
17th out of 309 runners overall, 
with a time of 21 minutes, 8.2 
seconds. Hodgins' time was only 
40 seconds off of the race leader's 
finish. Last year, Hodgins was 
UCSD's Racer of the Year and 
already has first and second place 
finishes in this season's first two 
meets. 

Sophomore Emily McGregor, 
whose time of 2 J :59.2 landed her 
in 69th place, followed Hodgins. 
Junior Erin O'Donnell placed 
third for the Triton, with a time 
of 22:36, and finished 78th over-
all. Sophomore Katie Olson and 
senior Nina Miller finished within 

four-tenths of a second of each 
other to place 89th and 90th, 
respectively, and completed the 
women's top five for the Tritons. 

The No. 21 men's team was 
headed by Lo5trom's stellar effort 
in the 8k race. Lostrom, voted 
the team's Most Valuable Male 
Racer in 2004, was the top Triton 
finisher of the day, placing 49th 
out of 299 competitors with a 
time of 24:28. His time was less 
than a minute off of the first-place 
finisher. 

Senior Luke Sigmon and 
sophomore Matt Noble rounded 
out the Tritons' top three and 
placed 122nd and 146th overall 
with respective time of 25:32 and 
25 :40. 

Junior Dan Holligan was 
fourth fa stest to cross the line 
for the Triton , finishing with a 
time of 25:52 for 163rd place. 
Completing the UCSD men's 
top five was senior Chris Beetley 
Hagler, who finished at 180th 
place in 26 minutes. 

The Georgetown Hoyas won 
the men' evenr for the third year 
in a row, while the Columbia team 
won the women 's division. 

Both UCSD teams have had 
strong seasons thus far, with the 
men finishing first against Point 
Lorna and fifth at the UC Irvine
