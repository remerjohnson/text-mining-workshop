CONTRIBUTING WRITER 

UCSD has agreed to join fur-
ther discus ions on a collaborative 
effort with three major insti tutions 
to build a stem cell research facility 
on university land. 

After a year of planning, the proj -
ect will bri ng UCSD, the Burnham 
Institute for Medical Research, the 
Salk Insti tu te for Biological Studies 
and the Scripps Research Institute 
together to fo rm the nonprofit San 
Diego Consortium for Regenerative 
Medicine. 

The consortium will unite the 
four biotech heavyweights that 
would otherwise compete for the $3

Co-op Agreement Remains Unsigned 
A.S. Council, GSA 
approve document 
without the blessing 
of co-ops.

NEWS EDITOR 

Although administration offi-
cials and A.S. councilmembers 
were sure that the lease deal for the 
university's co-ops was virtually 
complete, none of the four stores 

- the Food Co-op, Groundwork 
Books, the General Store Co-op 
and Che Cafe - have Signed the 
agreement. 

The university and co-ops have 
been negotiating for two years, 
after campus officials ordered 
specific changes to the Master 
Space Agreement - a contract 
that leased the facilities and made 
separate deals with the individual 
co-ops, the A.S. Council and the 
Graduate Student Association. The 
new changes include extension of 

Groundworlc Books, one of four university co-ops, is stiR muUing over a lease agreement 
drqfted by the A.s. Council and the administration. 

renewal periods and the addition 
of new language regarding altera-
tions and repairs. The co-ops have 
since been operating on month-to-
month leases. 

The new contract gives five 
two-year renewal options to the 
co-ops, and requires A.S. Council 
and , GSA certification of the co-
ops' effectiveness at each two-year 
period, according to Kate Pillon, 
Thurgood Marshall College senior 
senator and A.S. representative to 
the negotiations. 

Last week, Pillon said that the 
agreement was merely awaiting 
Signatures from the co-ops. 

Since then, however, A.S. council-
members and co-op officials found 
that addenda were missing from 
the proposed agreement, including 
a map of what will be considered 
co-op facilities, Pillon said. Those 
documents have since been submit-
ted, and the co-ops are expected to 
sign off on the agreement. 

The GSA approved the docu-
ment pending small grammatical 
corrections. The A.S. Council also 
approved the document at its latest 
meeting, although no co-ops have 
signed the document yet. 

"We have dual responsibilities; 
Pillon said. «We need to have a dis-
connect from the co-ops because 
we have a responsibility to students 
as a whole to the students. I don't 
think it's necessary for the co-ops 
to sign it for us to vote on the 
document.n 

Co-op members, who held a 
meeting on March 15, refused to 
comment, and said that their state-
ment would be released next week.

A.S. President Christopher

against lhe university's «appropri -

which bars graphic image of sexual 
activity and , during certain hours, 
profanity on the campus' cable net-

concerns to Chancellor Marye Anne

The guidelines, which could be

Funding for O.A.S.I.S.

The Office of Academic Support and Instructional Services was able to keep scheduled spring

AS SO CIATE N EW S EDITOR 

Avoiding budget cuts that would 
have forced the Office of Academic 
Support and Instructional Services to 
shut down many free t:utoring services 
next quarter, Chancellor Marye Anne 
Fox decided this week to temporarily 
restore limited funding for the pro-
gram. She has begun talks with other 
administrators about a long-term plan 
to prevent future cuts. 

The cuts, which amount to nearly 

$150,000, would have forced O.A.S.I.S. 
to close several tutoring workshops, 
incluping programs for physics, genet-
ics and upper-division chemistry class-
es, and would have affected hundreds 
of students who use the office's ser-
vices, according to O.A.S. I.S. Director 
Patrick Velasquez. 

Vela$quez stated in an e-mail that, 
in order to prevent workshop clo-
sures, Fox and other administrators 
transferred $26,000 from the yearly 
budget of Assistant Vice Chancellor 
of Student Educational Advancement 
Loren C. Thompson as an emergency 
supplement for O.A.S.I.S: spring pro-
grams. The action will cause a deficit in 
Thompson's yearly funding package for 
the tudent Educational Advancement 
cluster, the administrative division that 
houses o.A.S.l.S. According to Vice

Crowd-Safety Grid 
A wireless network developed 

by UCSD researchers and made up 
of high-tech satellite dishes, camer-
as, network boxes, laptops and cell 
phones providect local law-enforce-
ment officers a way to more effi-
ciently monitor the safety of large 
crowds during San Diego's Mardi 
Gras celebration last month. 

Various points throughout the 
24 -square-block section of down-
town were marked by the presence 
of equipment providing the wireless 
grid, and with it, police were able 
to monitor activity in areas without 
officers on patrol. The grid also 
enabled police to know the loca-

at all times. 

Music Department 
Releases New CD 
The UCSD music department 

has announced the release of a 
new CD composed of some of the 
depa rtment's best graduate work in 
composition and performance. The 
pieces were selected by cellist and 
mu ic profe sor Charles Curtis. 

The album, titled sound check 
one, includes seven pie es, all of 
which are acoustic. However, some 
of them were manipulated by com-

INVEST 

puters. Works range from contem-
porary interpretations of classical 
pieces to new works developed by 
department graduate students. 

The CD is the first in a new series 
of music department releases. The 
next album will be developed by 
music professor Miller Puckette a nd 
relea ed later this year. 

Hazing Goes 
Beyond Greeks 

Hazing rituals, well -known 
in Greek fraternity and soror-
ity circles, have also been widely 
reported across many other types 
of student organizations, incl ud-
ing athletic teams and band a nd 
performing arts groups, accordi ng 
to a new study by the National 
Association of Student Pe rsonnel 
Administrators. 

The results demonstrate that 
one in 20 students experienced 
hazing at his or her campus . Many ' 
students reported being forced to 
sing or chant and getti ng sick or 
passing out from being forced to 
drink large amounts of alcohol. 

The study represents phase o ne 
of a multistep examination of haz-
ing as an institution of student 
groups at colleges and universities 
nationwide. In the next two phases, 
NASPA will develop hazing-i nter-
vention models for use by adminis-
trators to combat the rituals.

New Triton Cable Rules Pit 
Couf.lcil Against Watson 

O rder was restored to the UCSD universe this week. with the withering-but-not-quite:dead 
Student-Run Television debacle once 
again running away with the spotlight 
at the final A.S. Council meeting of 
winter quarter. 

While deciding on her potential 
appointment as the next SRTV general 
manager, the council spontaneously 
grilled former cO-Manager Tiffany 

she said. Despite three votes against 
her, Rapp's appointment passed with 18 
votes. The council continued to discuss 
the terms of the appropriate use policy 
for Thton Cable in greater detail during 
its rouncil caucus. 

Before this could happen, how-
ever, a disagreement occured over a 
$500 allocation for a Sixth and Revelle 
CoUege sid trip, a senator project sub-
mitted by Revelle College Sophomore 

Senator Dan Florek 

New 
Business 

Rapp about the 
current and future 
state of the station, 
which remains 
off-air pending 
administrative 
action. Rapp, along 
with General co-
Manager Andy 

and Sixth College 
Sophomore Senator 
Gina Depper. 
Uncertainty arose 
when Senate Chair 

Matt L'Heureux Josb Martino 
mlheureu@ucsd.edu announced that 

Tess, was in charge of the station when 
the council shut it down in November 
for airing an unscheduled program. 

When asked to detail her qualifica-
tions for the position, Rapp stressed 
that her four years with SRTY, two as 
a director and station manager, as wdl 
as her close working relationship with 
Tess were reason enough to give her the 
general manager position. Some coun-
cilmembers expressed concern over the 
Triton Cable "appropriate use policy;" 
which establishes rules for program-
ming aired on the station. However, as 
some of the standards are not consistent 
with the current SRTV charter, sena-
tors questioned which document Rapp 
would hold in higher regard. 

"If next year the commissioner of 
programming told you to do some-
thing, but you moraJly disagreed with it, 
would you do I(?~ Thurgood Marshall 
College Chair Denis Shmidt asked. 

Rapp agreed that she would obey 
council orders, later responding 
to a similar question posed by Vice 
President of Academic Affairs Harry 
Khanna. "I don't think 1 would just dis-
regard [legislatipn] put in front of me,~ 

the event would 
be open to students from all colleges. 
although it would not be advertised to 
those students. 

MDo you guys know what not 
advertising means?" Shmidt said. "If 
you don't know the people, then you 
don't go:' 

The debate then turned from the 
particular event to senator projects in 
general, with some senators claiming 
that it was unusual for them to be put 
under such scrutiny. 

After the debate, the funding was 
approved in a 15-4-3 vote. Going back 
to SRTY, the council vented about the 
acceptable use policy and its ban of 
"the f-word," as well as the unlimited 
authority it would give Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs Joeepb W. Watson 
over the status of the station. 

"Dr. Watson is God as far as the 
[policy] is involved,» Khanna said. "He 
is the judge, jury and executioner." 

With all of the council appearing to 
lean in the same direction, promises of 
future resolutions on the topic ended 
the calmest council caucus of the year 
- that had nothing to do with break-
fast food, that is.

UC Academic Senate Ousts Leader 
Committee questions 
leadership and 
management abilities 
of top official. 

By Charles Nguyen 
NEWS EDITOR 

The University of California's top 
faculty board voted to oust its leader 
this week, marking the first time a 
UC senate chair has been booted 
from office. 

In a special meeting on March 
13, the UC Academic Senate ques-
tioned Chair Clifford Brunk's abil-
ity to effectively perform his duties, 
and accurately portray the faculty's 
vie;vs. Senators then removed Brunk 
from his position. 

Uncertainty about Brunk's lead-
ership arose in February, when a 
committee within the Academic 
Senate delivered a vote of no conti-
dence in Bruit!t's abilities as the sen-
ate's head, which represents about 
15,000 UC faculty. 

After its vote, the Academic 
Council asked Brunk to resign or 

arrange a meeting to consider his 
removal. Brunk, however, did not' 
leave, forcing the Academic Senate 
to call for its own special meeting. 

"This is a very difficult prec-
edent to set for the UC Senate,» 
UCSD Academic Senate Chair Jean-
Bernard Minster stated in a cam-
pus wide e-mail. "This was done in 
a very deliberate, measured fashion. 
The outcome was painful to all of 

wa.&" ... is a very difficult 
precedent to set for 

the UC Senate?' 
- Jean-Bernard Minster, Chair, 

UCSD Academic Senate 
us:' 

Senate officials and faculty, who 
asked not to be identified, accused 
Brunk of allowing his personal 
views to interfere with his posi-
tion. Some said that Brunk barred 
issues from being presented in the 
senate because he disagreed with 

them. Lawrence Pitts and George 
Blumenthal, former chairs of the 
Academic Senate, also' questioned 
Brunk's treatment of employees in 
a January letter to the Academic 
Council. 

Several newspapers, such as 
the San Francisco Chronicle, cited 
Brunk's management of the UC 
compensation scandals as a primary 
reason for the senate's disapproval. 

"[Brunk] has been slow to under-
stand the seriousness of the compen-
sation scandal,» UC Berkeley public 
policy professor Bruce Fuller told 
the San Francisco Chronicle. 

However, UC Berkeley Academic 
Senate Chair Alice '''gogino sug-
gested that concerns about Brunk 
were more "broad based:' and not 
focused on compensation issues, in 
an e -mail sent to the UC Berkeley 
Academic Senate earlier this month. 

Brunk's tenure as chair was set 
to expire on Aug. 31, but Academic 
Senate Vice Chair John Oakley has 
since taken over the position.

Sweeten Points to Sex On Other Channels 
• SRTV, from page 1 
sexual activity such as but not lim-
ited to intercourse, fellatio, cun -
nilingus or masturbation .~ 

The policy came in response 
to Student-Run Television's broad -
cast of pornography in November, 
which resulted in its shutdown . 
SRTV co-Manager Andrew Tess 
has long criticized the vagueness 
of the university's justifications for 
keeping the station off-air. 

" [The university] tells us that 
'graphic depictions of sexual activ-
ity involving nudity' isn't allowed 
on campus channels,» Tess said 

in January. "What does that even 
mean? They don't define it in any 
way:' 

The new policy - drafted by 
acting Assistant Vice Chancellor 
of Student Life Gary R. Ratcliff, 
Administrative Computing and 
Telecommunications, campus 
lawyers and the Student Affairs 
office - finally specifies what kind 
of nudity is banned from Triton 
Cable, according to Ratcliff. 

"There's not much room for 
interpretation anymore,» he said. 

The new policy, however, cre-
ates a double standard for content · 

on other stations on the network, 
according to Sweeten. 

"[The policy] is contradictory 
to what already airs on the net-
work outside of SRT\r,' he stated in 
a report to the A.S. Council. "I will 
not allow this hypocrisy to con-
tinue at the fate of students getting 
shafted by the administration ." 

Sweeten referred to ai rings on 
the Sundance Channel and HBD, 
which are both broadcast over 
Triton Cable, and would be pro-
hibited under the latest policy. In

A DROP FROM THE INKWELL By Riley Salant-Pearce 

Should an Org's Exclusiveness 
Preclude University Funding? 

The Student Regulations Review Committee recently recommended policy changes 
that would bar funding of student 
organizations that discriminate in 
their membership and 

want to have associated with your 
group. Imagine you're a member of 
Asian and Pacific Islanders Student 
Association, and you discover that 
another member sent the Guardian 

a letter that contains a 
events that exclude any 
campus groups. Though 
the groups would still be 

DEBATE 
bunch of racial slurs and 
denigrates all non-Asian 
races. ¥ouCl probably 

allowed to use campus facilities, they 
would only receive funding for events 
open to the whole campus. Should 
such a policy be allowed to stand? 

Marianne Madden, Opinion 
Editor: Yes, I think it's a good policy 
that should stand. Campus groups 
should learn that discriminating 
when it comes to their members is 
not a good thing 10 do. 

Hanna Camp, Associate Opinion 
Editor: Except that aU groups do that. 
A student group generally has a spe-
cific purpose for existing and goals 
they'd like to accomplish beyond the 
"meet and greet" social aspect. If a 
student's presence will only disrupt 
things, a group is perfectly within 
its rights to kick them out, and they 
shouldn't have to sacrifice their fund -
ing to retain that right. 

MM: But who says certain people 
are there to disrupt things? I can 
easily see a non -Christian person 
checking out a Christian club if they 
want to learn about Christianity, 
meet new people, or simply hang 
out with a different group. Also, l ' 
disagree with your assertion that 
most or aU groups are exclusive to a 
certain extent. Group members are 
largely self-selecting: A person who 
doesn't mesh with the group eventu-
ally drops out. But that doesn't mean 
that student organizations should 
actively exclude members or have a 
policy that only allows a certain type 
of person to jOin. 

HC: If a non-Christian wanders 
into a Campus Crusade for Christ 
meeting, 1 guarantee you they're not 
going to want to exclude him or her. 
They want people to learn about , 
Christianity. But if that person ends 
up constantly disrupting the -group's 
activities, even if it's just by ask-
ing a bunch of questions during the 
quiet prayer time, the group may not 
be willing to change everything to 
accommodate this person. 

To address the point about self-
selection, that certainly goes into effect. 
But we all know there are assholes out 
there who just don't know when to 
quit. Beyond that, there are issues of 
determining what kind of person you 

want that guy kicked out posthaste. 
MM: Sure. The situation you 

describe is kicking out a person who 
deserves to be kicked out, just like 
a disruptive student deserves to be 
kicked out of a class but shouldn't lose 
their right to attend third grade. But 
the existence of a few jerks shouldn't 
prelude a wholesale policy against cer-
tain people. And as I implied before, a 
racist person probably wouldn't have 
the patience to sit through APSA

meetings, and the editors of the news-
paper would smell a rat when a racist 
letter was submitted and subsequently 
not print it, or check with the presi-
dent of APSA. 

HC: I agree, but the issue is: Did 
APSA discriminate? I would argue 
they did. They excluded someone 
based on his ideology, just like the 
Christian groups in question disCrim-
inate against those who hold non-
Christian ideologies. Should the com-
mittee discover this, it would seem to 
meet the definition of discrimination 
needed for denying funding. 

MM: ( don't see it as discrimi-
nation; I see it as necessary action. 
The guy proved he didn't respect the 
group, nor deserve to be in it. I've seen 
jerky people like that be forced out of 
campus groups all the time. Whether 
that's good or bad, I'm not sure - but 
it happens, and it's subtler than hav-
ing a policy against certain people. 
And what are campus groups going 
to do, make new members sign a 
loyalty oath or express their ideologies 
in writing? Should potential APSA 
members sitn a statement that they 

will fight for the progress of Asian and 
Pacific Islanders? That's pretty silly. 

( guess I brought up the fact that 
discrimination by groups is a lot sub-
tler than it could be, because the heads 
of certain groups are pretty wily. It's no 
accident that certain groups only give 
out rave cards to certain people on 
Library Walk, and each sorority and 
fraternity has a certain type of mem-
ber. I would like ~ose groups to be 
more open. People learn from inclu-

• sive groups, and they become insular 
when they hang out with people who 
are exactly like them. 

HC: But that's exactly the point. 
Discrimination can come as an active 
policy or simply as unconscious pref-

. erences for certain types of people, and 
this policy doesn't specify which type 
can precipitate loss of funding. You 
can wish that fraternities and groups 
be more inclusive, but this policy 
change is being proposed because the 
UC Hastings College of Law refused 
to fund a certain Christian group 
that "did not agree to accept mem-
bers who openly opposed Christian 
beliefs." Except that they should be 
able to refuse such people. That's not 
like denying a group money because it 
refuses to invite everyone to the party. 
That's like citing it for turning away 
potential members that show up with 
a cap gun in hand. 

MM: (t's not like the board target-
ed this Christian group. The Christian 
group was just extremely open about 
their policy of ~iscrimination. And 
how is checking out a Christian orga-
ni7.ation as a non-Christian analo-
gous to going to a party with a cap 
gun? (fs not necessarily a sign you're 
aiming to disrupt the group - at all. 
And aren't Christians supposed to be 
accepting of people, and evangelical 
Christians happy to try to convert 
nonbelievers? 

HC: The group still can let the 
guys come to the meeting - if they 
behave themselves. But it doesn't 
have to, and it shouldn't have to put 
them on the membership roll. 

MM: I suppose not. But it's unfair to 
exclude a huge group of people, like all 
non-Christians, because of those few. 
Plus, the way Student Organizations 
Leadership Opportunities (S.O.L.o.) 
is structured, four or five principal 
members of the organizations sub-
mit their names and contact informa-
tion to S.O.L.O. at the beginning of 
the quarter, and it is those principal

Crazy Takes Over Hollywood 
and Chef Leaves the Kitchen 

"We must respect the other fellow's religion, 
but only in the sense and to the extent that we 
respect his theory that his wife is beautifUl and 
his children smart." 

Hollywood Fake Religion family, then 
Scientology is the evil, psychotic stepsister. It's 
all very ironic because the beliefs Scientology 
espouses don't seem to mesh very well with 

- H .t. Mencken Hollywood vaJues - specifically the values of 

Scientology, you've gone too far. I'll give you John Travolta, Beck, Jason Lee and even that charming red -
head, Laura Prepon. I' ll give 
you that asshole Tom C ruise 
and his blank-eyed drone, 

being hedonistic, free-spirited and not a com-
plete asshole on the "Today Show:' 

If Katie Holmes stays with Tom Cruise, 
it's doubtful she'll ever act again (not that 

that will have created a 

I ndecent huge vacuum of talent ) - and now Isaac Hayes 
Katie Holmes. 

But Isaac Hayes? Oh no, 
you little fucker. That's too 

Exposu re may quit the business for good . Let's all pray 
Marianne Madden the Hollywood money-

much. grubbing machine out-
In case you dear readers 

don't follow the bizarre foot -
mmadden@ucsd .edu lasts the Crazy Mill , and 

notes of Hollywood gomgs-on, Isaac Hayes, 
who voices the womanizing, chocolate ball -
making chef on "South Park," quit the show 
because he was upset about its skewering of 
religion. Nevermind that he made not a peep 
when the show poked fun at Christianity, 
(slam, ranting Jewish mothers, gays, melro-
sexuals and every other group that makes 
satire more fun because they're so damn sen-
sitive about everything. 

Trey Stone and Matt Parker, creators of the 
show, capitalized on the obvious hypocrisy 
of Hayes' move. "He has no problem - and 
he's cashed plenty of checks - with our show 
making fun of Christians," Stone said. Those 
checks probably went toward Scientology, 
which demands increaSingly large amounts 
of money as members progress to higher 
Operating Thetan levels (I kid you not) . 

Well, to hell with this. What.k.ind of world 
do we live in when a science fiction -esque 
"religion" gets in the way of Hollywood actors 
doing what they do bes t: lending their tal -
ents to the most off-color, entertaining shows 
Comedy Central cares to air? 

Perhaps L. Ron Hubbard was wilier than 
he seemed when he set up the Celebrity 
Center in 1955 to recruit celebrities and raise 
the profile of Scientology. Jesus! He's stealing 
our entertainment! 

If KabaLlah is the senile uncle of the 

Scientology passes. 
But that's doubtful, because if there's any-

one who will fall for anything and every· 
th ing that's batshit insane, it's a celebrity. My 
theory is that stars tire of their usual routine 
of dieting, tanning, primping, doing coke, 
upgrading their mansions, and making and 
breaking engagements, so they gulp some 
Crazy PiUs to spice up their lives. Think of 
all the weak-willed stargazers who have taken 
up Scientology because their favorite celebrity 
adopted it . Poor wretches. 

I know what you're thinking: I hate reli -
gion. Not true! Religion is a fabulous thing, 
as long as it doesn't affect my life in any way 
and doesn't make soul legends quit animated 
TV shows . 

In fact, I've even given up coffee for Lent. 
The experience is, as predicted, terrible. I 
don't feel more spiritual, 1 feel more tired. 
But all that suffering pales in comparison to 
the sense of smugness and superiority I feel 
when ordering a chai latte or hot chocolate at 
a coffee shop, or passing those by altogether. 
Isn't smugness and superority what religion 
is all about? I'd say yes . .. if I weren't so god-
damn tired. 

As usual, I'm not sure what point I'm try-
ing to make. But please, Isaac, quit sucking on 
the tit of insanity and hie thee back to South 
Park. Your viewing audience needs you more 
than Xenu does.

Where's the Line Between Self-
Selection and Discrimination? 

• FUNDING, from page 4 
members who are responsible for the group. 
A disruptive person who comes to one or two 
meetings will not become affLIiated with the 
group. 

The idea behind the policy is that the 
university shouldn't endorse discrimination 
- any sort of discrimination - by its students 
by giving these groups money. The univer-
sity shouldn't have to pay for groups who are 
xenophobic - this is college. 

He: But excluding non-Christians from 
a Christian group isn't xenophobic. As dis-
crimination goes, it's mild at best. If aU groups 
discriminate in their membership in some 
way - and they do - then a policy that 
would deny funding to a Christian group like 
this one but not a fraternity is hypocritical. As 
an agnostic, if (joined the Atheists, Agnostics 
and Free Thinkers Group and a few weeks 
later a very earnest evange.lical Christian asked 
to join, I'd vote not to let him in. It's not that [ 
hate evangel.icaLs, it's just that 1 didn't join the 
group to debate with believers, ( joined to talk 
with fellow nonbelievers. 

MM: ( agree that not limiting funding to 
Greek organizations, which are admittedly "tra-
ditionally discriminatory:' isn't fair. I suspect 
it's because Greeks nationwide have a lot of 
lobbying power. As for an evangelical Christian 
inftltrating an agnostic/atheist group, ICI love to 
see that happen. The person would receive the 
ultimate cold shoulder from all the people who 
really do have a stake in the group, and then 
disappear, never to be seen again. That's self-
selection. And I bet that would happen even if 
the agnostics had a written policy against reli -
gious types - any old student can still check 
out any club meeting they want. 

HC: First off, [ don't think it would play 
out that way. Atheists and agnostics generally 
can't let a "Jesus loves you" statement slide. 
I imagine what would happen is that people 
would get sidetracked, meeting after meeting, 
and that's exactly what I didn't want. That's 
why you sometimes have to lay down the law 
about who joins and who doesn't. 

Second of all, if the scenario you proposed 
did play out, then that's discrimination as sure 

as if you had a formal policy. What prevents 
the new funding rule from applying to that 
type of discrimination? 

MM: What else would atheists and agnos-
. tics do at meetings, besides discuss religiOUS 

beliefs? Have a lot of premarital sex? 
And an evangelical Christian quitting the 

group isn't discrimination. It's someone will-
ingly leaving the group, just like someone 
might leave a group when they go abroad. 
In that case it's the choice of the person, not 
the policy of the organization, which is very 
different. 

HC: But if the Christian one day asks to 
be one of the principal members, it' entirely 
within reason for the group to say, "Sorry, but 
your beliefs aren't the kind we want:' 

MM: Regardless of whether groups C1In 
gain from implicitly or explicitly exclud-
ing people, the separate issue still stands of 
whether the university should fund closed 
groups. And it's worth pointing out that such 
exclusive groups would still receive funding 
for events open to the whole campus, and 
have use of campus facilities. Those are huge 
loopholes. 

HC: And their existence suggests to me that 
the university knows it can't succeed in rooting 
out discrimination among groups. We have 
so many for a reason. What the committee is 
trying to do is punish only a few groups who 
practice a form of discrimination they find a 
little more annoying than others. But the fact 
that it looks like the Christian group is being 
oppressive at first glance doesn't make it so: It's 
not reaUy doing anything other groups don't 
do. So I can't support the proposed policy. 

MM: WeU, it depends on the group. But I 
would hope that a respectful non-Christian 
would be able to go to meetings of a Christian 
organization, be open about their own beliefs, 
and start a dialogue about religion. Christians 
in a Christian group would, ( hope, be secure 
enough in their beliefs to have an honest 
discussion with an atheist, Muslim, Jew, etc. 
And that's why I support open membership 
policies. and universities holding back some 
funding and resources to groups that practice 
discrimination.

6 OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, MARCH 16, 2006 

LE~ERSTOTHEEDITOR~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Watts Used O.A.S.l.S. 

for Political Gain 
Dear Editor: 

In response to the whole O.A.S.I.S. 
fiasco, I just want to make sure one 
thing is absolutely clear: Daniel Watts 
was never responsib le for the campaign 
to save O.A.S.l.S. It is disheartening to 
see that he would stoop so low as to 
take credit for all of the hard work 
initiated by Movimiento Estudiantil 
Chicanola de AztJan (MEChA) 
and the Student Affinllative ActIOn 
Committee. The saddest thing is that 
he is onJy using O.A.S.l.S. to boost his 
vote for president. Why else would he 
even mention the fact that he is run-
ning for president alongside the "Save 
O.A.S.LS." jargon he regurgitates? 

I just want to make sure that all of 
the students that signed petitions at 
the Cross-Cultural Center, O.A.S.I.S., 
SAAC lounge, and throughout cam-
pus are not confused into believing 
that Watts was responsible. In fact, 
instead of working with us, he decided 
to go out of his way to prove his inter-
est in saving our learning center by 
rushing and collecting signatures one 
day before the due date and making 
it seem as if he didn't know he wasn't 
going to have enough signatures. 

The SAAC community. on the'other 
hand, has been collecting signatures 
since the first week of this quarter. We 
have collected around 1,500 signarures. 
I know it really should not matter who 
is recognized for saving O.A.S.LS. as 
long as the work gets done. What I 
don't agree with is using the hard work 
and dedication of students who truly 

care to promote a presidential elec-
tion. [f Watts really cared about saving 
O.A.S.I.S., why did he wait until a day 
before the due date to do anything? 
And why is he so gung ho about talk-
ing to the Guardian and mentioning 
that he is running for president? 

The Guardian has only helped cre-
ate this confusion and has showed a 
bias toward Watts. Thursday's article 
mentioned him as the presidential can-
didate before even quoting him. [t is 
unacceptable that Daniel Watts is using 
o.A.S.LS. for political gain, and that 
the Guardian is helping with it. 

The bottom line is that all of the 
petitions and e-mails to Dr. Watson 
were not the result of the hard work 
of Daniel Watts. He is attempting' to 
use the campaign to save O.A.S.l.S. 
to gain the votes of all the students 
who signed those petitions and who 
care about saving O.A.S.l.S. Do not 
be deceived. If anyone can be cred-
ited for saving O.A.S.l.S., it's Miguel 
Torres and Enrique Soto.

Black Student Union Vice 
President, SAAC Member 

Watts' Failure to Act 
Belies His Motivations 
Dear Editor: 

I am writing in reply to Daniel Watts' 
letter to the editor titled "o.A.S.I.S. 
Petition Needs Student Support:' If 
Mr. Watts said that dozens of his ori-
entees used O.A.S.l.S. and asked him 
about ways they can help assuage the 
funding cuts, why didn't he take on 

this matter long before election season 
began? It sounds fishy to start bringing 
up O.A.S.LS. around this time when 
SAAC orgs have been dealing with 
this issue since last year, during which 
MEChA spearheaded a committee to 
pressure administrators. Where were 
Watts and Eddie Herrera then? 

If Herrera and Watts had been 
involved with. these services, they 
would have known that the other 

/. . th mterestlng at 
atts can find so 

many loopholes in 
which he states that 

he isn't officially 
campaigning. " 

- Soap Chum, President, Asian 
and Pacific Islander Student 

Alliance 

entity that they brought up, SIORC, is 
pronounced "source" and not "sork" 
as Herrera pronounced it in his public 
input. Yes, Watts, you can review the 
cassette to see for yourself. If they are 
actively taking an interest in O.A.S.I.S. 
by doing some "petitioning" in a sym-

bo�ic manner as Watts mentioned, 
where are they on Library Walk now? 

The O.A.S.I.S. campaign effort 
began within the SAAC.community. 
To have it be used as a campaigning 
tool by Watts and Herrera is just 

Students have saved 
over $11 million so far!

Thanks to Those Who 
Saved O.A.S.l.S. 

Dear Editor: 
Congratulations to A.S. President 

Christopher Sweeten on his success-
ful meeting with Chancellor Marye 
Anne Fox. whi91 resulted in a prom-
ise from her to restore funding. at 
least temporarily, to the parts of the 
O.A.S.I.S. program that most directly 
benefit students. I was pleasantly sur-
prised that the chancellor responded 
so quickly to the students. Her quick 
response is really a testament to the 
efforts of the hundreds of OAS.l.S. 
supporters who've been working on 
this campaign for months. The credit 
for this success belongs to them and 
only· them, and it truly is an iriipres-
sive accomplishment; this is one of 
the only times I can remember that 
student outcry actually resulted in a 
change in policy. 

I've only been a part of this move-
ment for a couple weeks, ever since 
some of my orientees at Earl Warren 
College asked me for help. Since 
then, I've been dedicating my show 
on Warren College Television to 
O.A.S.I.S:s budget problems, and 
last Thursday I interviewed Jeffrey 

Montojo, an O.A.S.I.S. employee, 
about the funding cuts. fa like to thank 
him for explainina the situation to my 
view>ers better than [ ever could, and, I 
extend an open invitation to any other 
student on campus to come on the air 
as a guest on my show, broadcast every 
Monday and Thursday night on the 
all-campus college channel. 

It is important that all students 
understand the value of O.A.S.LS., and 
that the administration realizes the sup-
port it has among students. As SRTV 
co-Manager Andy Tess said at the last 
A.S. meeting. even though not every 
student on campus uses O.A.S.l.S., 
almost every student on campus knows 
someone who does. The knowledge 
presented in O.A.S.l.S. workshops and 
study sessions finds its way to every 
srudent, as O.A.S.I.S. users share the 
tips and study skills they glean from 
O.A.S.l.S. tutors. Its funding should 
remain a priority.

Watson Gets 
Full Power 
Over SRTV 

• POLICY, from page 3 
January, Tess also cited H BO as an 
example of the administration's bias 
against SRTV. 

"HBO shows 'Real Sex' every 
week;' he said. "ICI say that that 
show is crossing the university's line 
for permissible broadcasts:' 

Ratcliff doubted that the show's 
sexually explicit content violates the 
appropriate use policy. However. 
'Real Sex' regularly broadcasts seg-
ments titled "masturbation work-
shops," which would breach the 
university's rules. 

Regard less of other channels, 
the university is holding campus-
based channels to a higher standard, 
Ratcliff said. 

"The policy doe~n't apply to 
HBO. just to campus departments 
that are broadcasting on Triton 
Cable; he said. "SRTV is funded by 
the A.S. Council, which is a campus 
department, so it is a product and 
refiection of our campus. \'of will 
not have sexua lly explicit material 
be a reflection of our campus." 

I n addition, the policy gives Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Joseph 
W. Watson the power to cut access 
to the network without "notice, to 
halt or prevent suspected violations 
of thi policy;' the proposal states. 

The placement of power in 
Watson's hands is a dangerous viola-
tion of students' rights, Sweeten and 
Tess said. 

" [Watson] has the entirety of all 
decisions, including interpreting 
what is in ' the best interest of the 
university:" Tess stated in an e-mail 
to the A.S. Council. "[Watson] can 
decide that anything is a violation 
and thus be able to en force policy 
that is not written, meaning they 
need no real reason and can do what 
they are doing now, and keep the 
target ~oving.· 

Sweeten communicated his dis-
approval of the policy to the chan-
cello r in a meeting on March 10. 
Fox, who has not taken a firm stance 
on SRTV since it was shut down, 
did not offer a concrete opinion on 
the rules at the meeting, and instead 
said she would wait until after the 
30-day period to hear others' com-
ments. 

Sweeten, however, already took 
his stand in an e-mail to the council. 

U[ will not give in to the adminis-
tration's tactics," he stated .

Long-Term Funding Plan Not Yet Set for Program 
• O.A.S. I.S., from page 1 
ChanceUor of Student Affairs Joseph 
w. Watson, Velasquez and Thompson 
jointly agreed upon the amount. 

However, the funding transfer 
is only a temporary solution, and a 
$46.000 budget cut for next year is 
still set to take place, according to 
Velasquez, who also indicated that 
cuts have already forced the office to 
layoff two staff members. 

"To date, there has been noth-
ing approrimating a commitment to 
restore the $146,000 that has been 
cut from O.A.S.LS. or to cancel the 
scheduled $46,000 reduction for 
next school year," Velasquez wrote in 
a letter to A.S. President Christopher 
Sweeten. 

Originally, Watson ordered the 
cuts as part of a vast reduction in 
funding to all divisions of Student 
Affairs. except the Office of Students 
with Disabilities, as a result of the 
state's budget crisis several years 
ago. 

The budget cuts' reflected the 
admini tration's doubts over the 
office's ability to actually help students 
improve their academic performance. 
Although funding has been temporar-
ily restored, Watson indicated that the 
administration stiU wants evidence of 
the office's role in improving student 
academic performance. .

understanding on the goals, objec-

tives and priorities of the academic 
support programs at UCSD, how they 
are coordinated with the academic 
courses and their instructors and how 
program impacts should be assessed 
individually and coUectively; Watson 
stated in an e-mail . 

When O.A.S.LS. revealed that the 

to listen to students on this issue; 
Sweeten stated in an e-mail. "She 
was very receptive and listened with 
open ears. The outcome of the talk 
went smoothly ... The voice of the 
student did not go unheard and 
the restored funding is evidence of 
that."

President of 

cuts would force 
workshops to shut 
down, many stu-
dents were angered 
that they would no 
longer be able to 
utilize the office's 
free services. In 
response, staff and 
students organized 
a two-day protest 
on Library Walk 
last week, com-
plete with outdoor 
tutoring sessions, 

e voice of the 
student did not go 
unheard and the 

Academic Affairs 
Harry - Khanna 
indicated that the 
resolution played 
a decisive role in 
Fox's decision to 
grant temporary 
funding. 

" I think it 
restored funding is 
evidence of that?' 

was clear that 
_ Christopher Sweeten, A.S. needed til 

A.S. President show that the stu-
dent government 

to decry what they 
called Ole administration's neglect of 
the academic support office. 

Beyond the office, many other 
student groups also began their own 
campaigns against O.A.S. LS. cuts. 

The A.s. Council recently passed 
a unanimous resolution condemning 
the administration's decision to cut 
funding and demanding that it be 
restored. Sweeten also met with Fox 
on March 10 to address student con-
cerns about program closures. 

"Chancellor Fox was not reluctant 

[would 1 not allow 
such a poor decision on the part of 
Student Affairs to go unchallen'ged; 
he stated in an e·mail. 

Members of the Student 
Affirmative Action Committee, 
which had been working on restoring 
funding since last year, also met with 
administrators to express concerns 
about O.A.S.I .S. funding cuts, accord-
ing to Kyle Samia, the SAAC repre-
sentative to the A.S. Council. 

Samia said that the decision to 
restore money to O.A.s.I.S. was ben-

efidal to all students at UCSD . . 
"O.A.S.I.S. 'is a vital campus pro-

gram; he said. 
However, the most influential 

factor in the university's decision to 
transfer money to the office was the 
letters received by the administration 
from students who would not be able 
to continue workshops next quarter, 
according to Watson. 

Velasquez also stated that, in a 
meeting with the chanceUor, Fox, 
indicated that alUl1lJli concerns about 
O.A.S.lS. ruts were also an important 
part of the decision, as several alumni 
revealed that the office's tutoring ser-
vices had actually helped them gradu-
ate from the university. 

UCSD alumnus Juan ,,"storga, 
while happy that a temporary answer 
to the office's budget problems has 
been found, stated in an e-mall to the 
chancellor that a shon-term solution 
is not enough. 

"Please know that we will continue 
with our alumni letter-writing cam-
paign both to UCSD and state offidals 
until O.A.S.I.S. funding is returned 
and a plan of action is developed with 
actual doUar amounts attached to it; 
Astorga stated. 
. Watson is in charge of developing 
a long-term plan to bolster O.A.S.lS. 
funding, according to Velasquez.

Facility 
Could Be on 
UCSD Land 

• CELLS, from page 1 
by voters in November 2004. 

"Where you get the synergy is 
that the other institutions bring great 
excellence in areas where additional 
strength is helpful," said UCSD biol-
ogy professor Larry Goldstein, who 
penned the ballot measure. "You 
want the most diverse scientific 
input you can get." 

Chancellor Marye Anne Fox 
unveiled the plans to the UC Board 
.of Rege.nts, which reviewed fund-
ing conditions for the building of 
the facility. UCSD expects to secure 
money for the project from the 
California Institute for Regenerative 
Medicine, the state agency created 
by PropOSition 71. 

Richard Murphy, president and 
CEO of the Salk Institute, stated in 
an e-maiil that although there are 
nuances, which he did not specify to 
the operation and roles in his organi-
zation that require a more in -depth 
discussion, he is confident that the 
details will be worked out. 

Although the site for the facility 
has not been fmalized, UCSD is one 
of the main contenders, Associate 
Vice Chancellor of Communications 
Stacie Spector stated in an e-mail . 
The selection will be based on several 
factors, including required parking 
space, the size of the structure utili -
ties and future development. 

Under one roof, the consortium 
would create an efficient process of 
stem cell research, Goldstein said. 

"The availability of the faCility 
will encourage good scientists from 
each institution, many of whom are 
not now stem-cell scientists, to enter 
into stem-cell research; Murphy 
stated. "When this occurs, unex-
pected coUaborations will form and 
there will be an exchange of ideas 
and expertise that will lead to novel 
research projects:' 

As part of an accord, to which 
all four institutions have agreed. the 
COJl5Ortium will request grants from 
CIRM as one organization and not as 
individual institutions, Murphy stated. 

The head members of all organi-
zations involved in the consortium, 
including UCSD Vice Chancellor of 
Health Sciences Edward W. Holmes, 
are part of the 29-member commit-
tee that oversees the distribution of 
grants. 

However, the men involved in the 
consortium are banned from voting 
on the group's grant requests.

Leather-Faced Shepard 
By Gaelle Faure 

AS OCIATE H IATUS EDITOR 

Sympathy. It's one of the unspo· ken rules for crafting a film that works. Not that viewers have to 
actually like the film's protagonist(s), 
but they do have get close enough 
to relate to them on some level, 
however minute, be they mean girls 
or se rial killers. That said, rules are 
made to be broken. StiLI, keeplllg an 
audience sitting st ill for two hours 
just to folJow characters they don't 
have a smidgeon of sympathy for 
takes a rare master's hand. Director 
Wim Wenders, though a most ven-
erable master, fails to pull this off 
in "Don't Come Knocking." But the 
bigger problem i~ that it's unclear 

Don't Come Knocking 

** Starring Sam Shepard and Jessica Lange 
Directed by Wlm Wenders 

Opens March 17 
Rated R 

whether the film consciously tries to 
break the rule in the first place. 

It's a story of the American West 
and broken family ties, two of the 
German director's relentless obses-
sions. (See him at his apex in 1984's 
"Paris, Texas" for a fine mix of both.) 
"Don't Come Knocking" revisits the 
reliable 01' American Dream with a 
pastiche of symbols - Hollywood ' 
big-shots, classic diners, glittering 
casinos, cowboys galloping through 
the desert, '50s cars barreling down 
lonesome highways. In short, a 
European's wet American dream. 
Writer am Shepard, also an actor 
and virtuoso playwright who proved 
his screenwriting skill with "Pari, 
Texas," arranges this aU to fit in 
the present day by casting an aging 
cowboy-film star ( hepard him elf) 
as the failed protagonist. 

So much for making your 
own role. Shepard's got the per-
fect gruff, weather-sculpted face, 
but the cringing start at the first 
lines of dialogue and never lets go.

THIS DYSTOPIAN REVOLUTIONARY ARE FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY 
, the man from room five: Is he 
a terrorist or a freedom fighter? 
Thankfully - at least for those 
who intend only to be entertained 
- the question does not arise in 
the Wachowski brothers' simpli-
fied version of the great graphic 
novel, "V For Vendetta:' These 
fLlmmakers aren't content with 

allowing their audiences to make their own judg-
ments about what they've seen, but instead force 
black-and-white movie morality upon them, 
explaining exactly wh~ the hero is, and why the 
audience should root for him. The Wachowskis 
are known purveyors of uch Simplified charac-
terizations, as in the biblically epic flops that suc-
ceeded "The Matrix." In "V For Vendetta;' their 
adaptation of writer/wildman Alan Moore and 
illustrator David Lloyd's incomparable 1988 comic 
work, all the complexity is drained from Moore's 
depressing discussion of Margaret Thatcher-era 
conservatism, leaving a simple action fllm that 
doesn't have anything new to say. 

As far as action films are concerned, "Vendetta" 
is brilliant enough. Director James McTeigue 
combine dystopian "1984" visuals with "bloody 
fancy karate gimmicks," making for some fantas-
tic entertainment right up the alley of "Matrix" 
fans. Other elements of that movie are here as 
weU: the uncompromising, evil establishment; 
the nigh unstoppable, leaden-faced hero; and the 
mounting suspense as agents of the establishment 
hunt down the hero. It's an easy recipe for a pop-
corn flick, and makes for a good one. 

The story follows V (Hugo Weaving), who 
plans to take vengeance on the fa cist govern· 
ment that has en laved the people of England. 
The clever V is culturally literate by Wachowski 
standards (able to recite some Shakespeare and 
enjoy jazz), and bombastic, with a revolution-
ary sentiment for any situation. Evey (Natalie 
Portman) is rescued from crooked cops by V 
and is forced to take residence in his secret 

lair, a repository of books, art and music - all 
banned by the ruling fascist party. The chanceUor 
(John Hurt) is only a continuously livid face on a 
screen, commanding the secret police, the televi-
sion programming, the ever-present surveillance 
and, of course, the detectives assigned to find and 
stop V. Finch (Stephen Rea), the lead detective, 
is about the only complex character in the film, 
slowly realizing the horrors of his own govern-
ment while attempting to stop the single agent 
that could change it 

Instead of addressing a futuristic endpoint of 
Thatcherism, as Moore's original work does, the 
ftlm makes a few parallels to media and govern-
menl-inspired fear in the modem United tates, 
with an O'Reilly-type TV anchor that mocks the 
"once-great" America and the war that ruined it. 
Really, though, the politics are just for show, to 
make the action a bit less of a guilty pleasure. 

The elements of Moore's original vision that 
remain intact make for an intriguing suspense 
thriller, but where each of Moore's characters 
had their own complex personalities (fascists are 
people too, you know) the fllm forces the charac-
ters into good guy/bad guy generalizations - a 
dangerous style of reasoning. It may serve most 
dumb action flicks just fine, but where there's a 
hero who is an outspoken terrorist, that' no way 
to play it. Moore chose the path of ambiguity, 
never quite deciding whether V's efforts were 
justified, making his work a thoughtful classic. 
Blowing up Nazis, however, i nothing more than 
mindless entertainment - but in this case, it's 
awesome mindless entertainment.

ead Wood In This Sleepy Western 
by most but bizarrely unknown to 
those for whom it's convenient (the 
son he never knew he had). At this 
arbitrary point in his hedonistic 
life of drugs, women and scandal, 
Howard disappears from the set of 
his latest Western. He gets to do 
the scenic cowboy-riding-through-
the-desert photo op for a few min -
utes before he switches to more 
convenient modes of locomotion. 
Destination: his roots. His mother 
(Eva Marie Saint), whom he visits 
first in Reno, pain takingly beats 
into the viewer - because Howard, 
stone-cold, doesn't seem to register 
- how strange it is to sec him after 
so many years of abandonment. 
But apart from learning · through 
a casino scene that Howard is an 
annoying, violent drunk, we still see 
next to nothing of what lies behind 
the leathery mask. Too bad, because 
the casino i stunningly shot - mir-
rored ceilings reflect the swirling, 
heady Lights, leaving the viewer feel -
ing drunker than Howard; but here,

The New Pornographers 
• Twin Cinema 
MATADOR 

***~ 
It's not a secret by now that the New Pornographers - the conjunction of Canadian indie-rock royalty headed by the ambrosial-
voiced Carl Newman - can write a delidous 
pop-rock song. Their first two records are soaked 
with such warm, sweet critical saliva that prop-
erly defiant rock warts had a right to cultivate an 
allergy for Newman's minty-crisp chord changes 
and creamy, indelible harmonies - especially 
after they became the precious Live Journal diet 
for a million Garden State teenager . 

Those days are aU over. Twin Cinema renders 
the Pornographers' four-minute flirtations in 
such icily addictive transparency that the afore-
mentioned curmudgeons and tots-of-triviality 
will have to get along - sugar just never tasted 
this sweet. 

The candy appeal eeps from Cinemas decep-
tively crisp production. While Newman's notes are 

as perfectly crafted as ever, the paradoxical balance 
achieved between the layers of the arrangements 
("The Jessica Numbers" bears innumerable guitar 
tracks, yet the echo of the kick drum pedal booms 
a crucial pivot) reveals subtleties in the songwrit-
ing we never got to fully appreciate. With Neko 
Case sharing the vocal spotlight with Newman, 
and ex-Kinks frontman Ray Davies lending offi-
cial Britpop credentials to their heavily indebted 
repertoire, Twin Cinema shows a more mature 
and interesting New Pornographers than the 
indie-pop parrots they once seemed Sure. some 
of the 14 numbers on Twin Cinema quite clearly 
don't need to exist - but at least we can't say that 
about the whole group anymore. 

The New Pornographers will per/onn at tire 
Belly Up Tavern at 8 p.m. on March 20.

The Hellacopters 
• Rock' Roll Is Dead 
UNIVERSAllNT'l 

*** Rock 'n' roll is dead. At least according to the Swedish retro rock band, the Hellacopters it is. The title of their latest album undoubt-
edly refers to the eurotrash electronica that 
crowds the pop charts and blares over top-40 
radio stations in Europe. Despite the current 
music scene, the Hellacopters - one of Europe's 
guardians of old- chool rock - have managed 
to make a name for themselves in Europe since 
the mid-'90s. 

The Hellacopters' bluesy swagger has eamed 
them comparisons to the great American clas-
sic rock bands of the '70s, most frequently 
the Stooges. But the band rocks out with such 
overt glee that they can barely capture the 
same edgy unpredictability of the Stooges. Not 

to mention that Nicke Adresson's voice doesn't 
come close to matching Iggy's rebel-rousing 
guttural wail. 

Instead, Rock & Roll Is Dead is made up 
of an array of feel-good rock. Every track is 
packed full of energized, head-bobbin' rhythms. 
Although the Hellacopter's old-fashioned bal-
lads can at times get a little cheesy, they do turn 
out a couple of jam-worthy ditties ("Bring It 011 
Home" and "Everything is on TV"). 

Contrary to the album's title, the band proves 
rock 'n' roll is not dead. 

The Hellacopters will perform at the Casbah 
at 8:30 p.m. all March 23.

Creepy Charism~ Spices Up a Sloppy Satire Rock's Nearly Forgotten Ingenues 
Play to a' Vacationing Campus By Christine Clark ASSOCIATE HIATUS EDITOR 

If the political satire "Thank You for Smoking" says anything, it's that no one plays an asshole bet-
ter than Aaron Eckhart. Eckhart 
first gained fame playing a men-
acing womanizer in Neil LaBute's 
"In the Company of Men." Then, 
he became a spine-tingling creep 
in "Nurse Betty" (also directed by 
Labute). Now, in "Thank You for 
Smoking," he plays yet another 
unlikable character, Nick Naylor 
- a fast-talking tobacco lobby-
ist. Somehow Eckhart always man-
ages to bring a certain charm to 
the slimebag character he plays. 
II 's that lovable sleeze that makes 
" moking" a blast to watch. 

In the film, Naylor, who acts as a 
spokesman for big tobacco, launch- . 
es a campaign to get today's film 
actor puffing away on the silver 
screen (a la Boggie and Sacall) after 
a zealous congressman (William H. 
Macy) tries to put a poison label on 
all cigarette boxes. In Naylor's que t, 
he crosses paths with a slew of zany 
characters, but the most memorable 
is a Hollywood power mogul played 
by none other than Rob Lowe (oh, 
t he irony). . 

There isn't a moment in 
.. moking" that lacks sarcasm (hell, 
just read the title) . Each scene is 
jam-packed with wry humor and 
virtually every line of dialogue is 
a punch line. Sometimes it works 
- like the hilarious scene where 
a video clip of killer whales eat-

ASSOCIATE HIATUS EDITOR 

Considering the number of times -the Strokes" and "the future of rock and roU' appeared together 
in a sentence back when the band 
broke out in 2001, it must feel good 
for them to make it to 2006 in one 
piece (and not go the way of, say, Pete 
Doherty and co.). l\vo albums later, 
far seem the silly old days when the 
Strokes were revered as much for their 
slick ties as their music, and teenage 
girls analyzed each of the young prep 
school graduatd favorite ice cream 
flavors. While nobody can live up to 
that kind of hysterical hype, time heals 
all, giving the tight New York fivesome 
a chance to show that they were just, 
well, a pretty damn good rock band. Is 
there really any more to ask for? 

What made the Strokes more than 
a flash in the pan of would -be shaggy-
haired saviors was their sexy juxtapo-
sition of unpretentiously catchy, smart 
guitar hooks and Julian Casablanca's 
faux-blase tin -can vo als. imple 
beauty is in simple contrasts. And 
simplicity is the Strokes' credo in the 
studio, too, granting them improb-

able comparisons to basically every 
band from the '60s to the '80s thanks 
to their lack of lace and frills. 

After follOWing their delectable 
debut Is This It with the spodess sequel 
Room 0" Fire, the Strokes may have 
caught a mild case of the junior slump 
with their third, First Impressions 
of Earth, released in January. If the 
album is hit ("Juicebox") and miss 
("Ask Me Anythjng), though, it's 
only because the Strokes stick their 
scruffy necks a little further out of 
their collars. Casablanca suddenly 
sings like he does give a damn - he is 
a married man now, ladies. This may 
just translate into a new live dynamic, 
as the Stroke have a clinging repu-
tation for giving suitably detached 
performances. But fair-weather fans, 
fear not; early reports from the road 
point to an extensive, heavily [5 This 
It -nostalgic set list. 

If you were planning to be bor-
ing and stay put over break, redeem 
yourself and catch tl-.e show. 

The Strokes and the Eagles of Death

March 28. Doors open at 7 p.m. TIckets

Shepard's 
Mighty Pen 
Goes Limp 

• KNOCKING, from page 10 
like in the rest, the film works best 
when everyone shuts up. 

Hopes spring wild when his mother 
conveniently remembers to tell Howard 
that a woman called many, many years 
ago about some son of his in Butte, 
Mont But when he gets there, he on.ly 
digs himself a deeper hole by half· 
heartedly trying to get back into the life 
of Doreen, his ex (Je~sica Lange, giving 
the script her very best shot). What 
does Howard really want? Who the hell 
knows. Doreen, like Howard's mother, 
is a subservient, patient woman; both 
seem much too imeUigent to bother 
with Howard's antics, yet search tire· 
lessly for what they believe is a tortured 
soul buried in him. if only the viewer 
could see what they see. 

Adding to th is obsession over 
Howard is a detective (Tim Roth) sent 
out by the actor's Hollywood bosses 
to force him to fulfill his contract. By 
some odd logic, the stern detective is 
painted as a gigantic stereotype - cold, 
rude, foreign and meticulous to the 
point of having OCD. He's a pointle s 
plot device, providing one of the most 
unintentionally hilarious moments' of 
the fUm when he clicks his e1eclric 
shaver on and off over the dead silent 
desert and asks, "[s anyone there?" 

Then, to complicate things fur· 
ther, come the youngsters. They're a 
nice diversion, but none of them ring 
truer than the last. Sarah Polley fits 
the film's female mold as yel another 
unknown offspring, who takes pity 
upon Howard while she stalks him, 
aU the while holding an urn contain· 
ing her mother's ashes under her 
arm (the urn mainly serves for her 
to talk to in a great "tell ·not·show" 
exposition of the improbable plot 
turns.) Then there's Howard 's son by 
Doreen, Earl (Gabriel Mann), and 
Earl's insane girlfriend (Fauu7.a Balk, 
who does a creepy remake of her I'm· 
so-quirky-and ·crazy-and-bug-eyed · 
who·knows· what-I'll · do-next per-
sona from "The Craft':) Earl. though 
he's never met his father and has a 
lovely mother, seems out to prove that 
machismo and violence is genetic, 
picking fights and throwing the entire 
contents of his room out his second-
floor window and into the middle 
of the street. (In a movie where sus· 
pension of disbe.lief is required here 
and there and everywhere, neighbors 
don't exist.) Guess how the inevitable 
father-son meeting goes down. If your 
guess is along the lines of "You're not 
my father; [ never needed a father:' 
you're close enough. But the key to a 
manly father-son reconciliation in the 
wild west is, of course, to give the son 
the keys to that classic car. 

Earl does provide Wenders with a 
nostalgic inter!:Jde, thankfully. The boy 
can sing and does a smoky-bar per-
formance eerily mirroring the concert 
scene in Wenders' 1987 masterpiece 
"Wings of Desire." Butte, Mont. is no 
'80s underground Berlin, and Mann 
is no young Nick Cave, but it's a nice 
touch reminding aU the more of what 
could have been. 

The cast also has to get credit for 
fighting through their lines. Shepard's 
script would have sounded forced 
even on the stage; on screen, it's too 
often laughable at the (ostensible) 
height of drama. Hear Doreen and 
the estranged daughter, who've just 
met: SKY - "I think I like the movies 
better." DOREEN - "Than what?" 
SKY, in hushed tones - "Than real 
life:' Or even better is Doreen hys· 
terically yell ing at Howard on the 
street: "You 're a coward, Howard! 
That rhymes, doesn't it?" 

Viewers, with hardly any insight 
into the wooden Howard, are left 
with a closing image of the three 
youngsters driving Howard's old car 
pa t an ominous road sign that reads 
"Divide - I; Wisdom - 52:' For most 
of the movie Ihe viewer is left ask-
ing "Are we there yet?" But when we 
finally are there, there is still a long, 
long way to go.

Tennis Falls to Division-I Hornets· 
Tritons' six-game 
winning streak comes 
to an end with close 
5-4 home loss to 
Sacramento State. 

By Kelli Prakash 
STAF F WR ITER 

The UCSD men's tennis team final-
ly ran out of the energy it needed to 
continue a Six-game winning streak, 
losing for the first time Ihis month 
to the Division-I Sacramento State 
Hornets on March 14. 

The final score was a light 5-4 
as the Tritons, now 6-7, lost to the 
Hornets, who improved their record 10 
5-4. Six. of the Tritons' seven losses are 
against Division-l teams. 

The Trilons had a rough time in 
their usually strong doubles game, los-
ing 2-1, with their only win coming 
from the No. 3 pair of sophomores 
Kazumi Negishi and Eric Rubens, 
who beat their opponenls Hugue Van 
Dillen and Paul Komoniczak in a close 
9-8 victory. 

UCSD's No. I doubles team, senior 
Erik Oijala and sophomore Blake 
Meister, fell to Junaid Hossain and 
Gabriel Loredo, 8-3, and the No. 2 
team of seniors Brent Molden and 
Steven Oechel fell to Warwick Foy and 
Ramon Perez 8-5. 

Coach Eric Steidlmayer was not 
pleased with the intensity of his team's 
doubles play against the Hornets. 

"Our doubles play left a lot to be 
desired;' he said . "Our guys haven't yet 
realized how important it is for them 
to be really amped for every point. In 
doubles, you never know when the 
point will become important, espe-
dally when playing a pro-set However, 
we did compete well in singles today 
against Sac State."

final game, 6-3, to clinch the match for 
the Hornets. 

The Tritons lost in the top three 
positions of singles 

Coming off the loss to Sacrame/lto, 
Steidlmayer was slightly baffled by 

his team's perf or-
play, but their bot-

victories came 
from No. 4 Oijala

"I wonder if 

our team settles 
for mediocrity; 
he said. "We had 
a great previous 
week, winning 
five in a row, but 
our last in the

Gonzaga, and the 
intensity just wasn't

but wins for the rest of the match, as 
OijaJa, Meister, Negishi and Rubens 
defeated their opponents. 

UCSD went 6-0 with perfect 
singles play against the Bulldogs. 
Molden and Rubens quickly downed 
their Bulldog opponents in two sets. 
However, Meister and Oijala needed 
extra sets to take care of their com-
petitors as Meister pulled off a 10-2 
win in his fmal game and OijaJa 
fought to earn a 14-12 win in his 
decisive third game. 

In a match on March 15, the Tritons 
could not keep pace with the Yale 
Bulldogs, falling 8-1 with the lone win 
coming from a singles win by Rubens. 

"Our schedule is very challenging 
this year, and one that pushes us to 
improve each and every time out; 
Steidlmayer said. "I hope that all the 
guys take that challenge head on:' 

The Tritons will face their next 
opponent on April I, when they chal-

18 SPORTS THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

UCSD Faces Challenge Against No.3 Chico 
• BASEBALL, from page 20 
in the bottom of the inning. 

Freshman pitcher Trevor Decker, 
who came in to relieve Navarro 
in the middle of the seventh, was 
tagged with the loss after surren-
dering the winning run on a left 
field single to Grand Canyon catcher 
Tristan Blalock. 

Decker, who gave up a walk-
off home run earlier in the year, 
explained his gameplan coming into 
the pressure situation. 

"I just wanted to throw strikes. 
keep the ball down and do my job 
of getting us back into the dugout to 
hit;' he said. 

Blalock came up with . an RBI 
opportunity because of leflfielder 
Giancarlo Silvestri's leadoff double 
and a sacrifice bunt from second 
baseman Jacob Hanna. Blalock's 
hit on a 2-2 count was more than 
enough to score Silvestri from third 
and put his Antelopes up for good. 

"They're hitting pitches in big-
time situations with a lot of pressure 
on them and just coming through 
for their learn;' Decker said. 

Although Grand Canyon would 
go on to win, the Antelopes' closer 
Matt Michael did not come away 
with his fifth save of the year with-
out some ninth-inning dramatics. 
First baseman Brian Trump dou-
bled and advanced to third, ' put-
ting the Tritons in tying position 
and. hopefully, sending the game 
to extra innings. However, Trump 
inexplicably broke for home in an 
attempt to win on a steal, only to 
be tagged out by Blalock to end the 

game. 
"I think to avoid these come-

back losses, we just need to stay up 
all game and focus a little harder;' 
Decker said. "We just need to keep 
the pressure on every inning instead 
of building it up quickly and losing 
it. We need to finish them off and 
not let them hang around:' 

Blowing a four-run lead to an 
unranked, nonconference oppo-
nent threatened to put the Tritons 
in position to get swept going into 
the toughest part 9f their sched-
ule. where they will face No. 3 
Chico State three times in between 
two series against No. 13 Cal State 
Stanislaus. However. UCSD post-
ed a 5-1 win in the second game 
against Grand Canyon behind 
Byron Grubman's three-hit, com- ' 
plete-game performance to split the 
series. 

"It was a tough split for us in 
Grand Canyon because we felt like 
we outplayed them for an entire 
day, except for one inning; UCSD 
head coach Dan O'Brien said. "The 
good news is this team is starting to 
real ize how good they can be and 
we're building a lot of confidence." 

One player who must be riding 
a wave of confidence is freshman 
second baseman Garret Imeson, 
who came off a ridiculous 9-hit . 
S-RBI performance in the series 
against Cal State Los Angeles with 
five hits in the doubleheader versus 
Grand- Canyon. His two hits in the 
second game, coupled with multihit 
days from senior outfielder David 
Gomez and junior second baseman 

John Roth. gave the Tritons five 
runs in the win, including a four-
run third inning that put UCSD 
ahead for good. 

The 5-1 victory gave the Tritons 
their 14th overall :win, which is 
significantly fewer than the records 
of their next opponents, Chico State 
and Cal State Stanislaus. The No. 
3 Wildcats boast an 18-5 record. 
while the Warriors stand at 16-7. 
While overall records matter, the 
three teams will be jockeying for a 
position at the top of the competi-
tive California Collegiate Athletic 
Association. Chico State leads the 
CCAA with a 7-3 league record and 
the Tritons and Warriors are close 
behind with 7-5 marks. A winning 
record in all three series against Cal 
State Stanislaus and Chico State 
would put the Tritons in good posi-
tion to pass the Wildcats for the 
No. 1 seed in the west region of the 
NCAA. 

O'Brien thinks his team is capa-
ble of pulling off upsets over their 
upcoming opponents. 

"I'm looking forward to fInish -
ing the season with this team as 
they continue to get better every-
day," O'Brien said. . 

. UCSD will start the first impor-
tant three-game series against the 
Warriors at home on March 17_ The 
Tritons will then get a week of rest 
before hosting the league-leading 
Wildcats for four games on March 
26 and March 27. Finally, UCSD will 
travel to Thrlock, Calif., for the flDal 
four matchups against Stanislaus 
this season on March 31.

Tennis to Build On Loss to 
Defending D-III Champions 
• TENNIS, from page 20 
Tritons, recounting the eerily simi-
lar circumstances from earlier in the 
match. would not let history repeat 
itself. In the 15th game, with UCSD 
serving, Emory mounted its offen-
sive, pounding shot after shot at 
the Tritons. Bronowicki once again 
put an end to the attack, sending 
the ball to the right corner with an 
emphatic yell . 

With an 8-7 lead and no desire 
to extend the already lengthy mara-
thon, the Tritons put an end to the 
Eagles' chances in a decisively domi-
nant victory in the 16th game. After 
an initial rally, in which the Tritons 
worked vigorously to defend their 
lead, Emory double faulted twice to 
fall behind in the game. Both teams 

notched several points. but with 
UCSD in command, Emory faded 
at match point. returning a shot long 
and out for a Triton victory. 

LaPlante was pleased with her 
team's efforts against the perennial D-
III favorite, and said that the Tritons 
gained experience from the loss. 

"Right now, the team is young 
and just needs more match tough-
ness," she said. "Most of the teams in 
our conference are so much weaker 
than us, they don't give us any com-
petition:' 

Despite some inspiring play from 
the Tritons, their team loss drops 
them to 6-4 on the season, but they 
remain undefeated in league play. 
The Tritons face league opponent Cal 
State San Bernardino on March 17.

shift happen, and watch the NBA 
Olympic team become a running 
joke among sports fans across the 
nation. There's no longer any reli -
ability or commitment in today's 
players, and that's why they'll have 
trouble playing against countries 
that actually want to be at the games 
and win a gold medal. 

Maybe I 'm not giving credit 

where it's due; China and Russia 
have genetically engineering Yao 
Mings competing for their country. 
making the competition that much 
harder. But, bey, at least they care 
enough about their team to do so. 
There are only so many things that

Egos Detract From USA 
Olympic Basketball T earn 

Today's players are no 
Dream Team and are 
susceptible to upsets 
from teams with more 
pride, fundamentals. 

B rowsing the recently released 2008 Olympic basketball ros ter felt like eeing who 
"ould be ca t for the next sea on of 
"The urreal Life." And to tell you 
the truth, I wasn't nearly a, excited 
about seeing hris Bo h paired up 
,qth Dwayne Wade a I \\as about 
( hyna hving with Mint - ~le. I'm just 
bracing myself two rears ahead for 
anothe r disap -
pointing turn -
out - with luck, 

obc Hyrant and 
Lt Bron James will 
,t,\\' grou nded 
and thel r big egos 
\ III allow them to -
"avon the ro -
t r. glvmg u the chan.:e to witne s 
the drama and finger-pOi nting of a 
bunch of B-Iist basketball players. 

Comparing basketball now to 
"hat it was years ago, you can't help 
but wonder what happened to the 
glory of playing for your country 
and winni ng a shot at a gold medal. 
It seem that ushering in the Kobes 
and the Carmelo Anthonys of the 
t ime introduced a new era to the 

~BA , wi th the slogan: Just give me 
the ball and I'll make you money. 

Maybe it' the image of the 
unbreakable Dream Team featur-
ing Charle Barkley, Michael Jordan, 
Karl Malone, John tockton, Patrick 
Ewi ng and Chris Mullin, among 
others, that makes me think that 
no other team could even compete. 
And that was 14 years ago. 'AII 12 of 
those players deserved to be on that 

roster and were grateful to be there, 
too. They were the big hots of their 
time, and no ego, no fea r of getting 
injured and no meager paycheck was 
going to stop them from winning a 
gold medal. Together, they were so 
formidable that they were crowned 
the Dream Team, and no other team 
has even come close to the re pect 
that tho e 12 were given . 

I\'e come to terms with a lot 
of things in the NBA. I'm used to 
lower-scoring games, flashier play-
er and ego bigger than the append-
age between Shaq's leg , but there's 
one thing that I still can't accept: 
the dete rioration of he Olympic 
basketball team. Growing up, I've 

come to ee how 
much the league 
has shifted from 
men that love to 
play to men that 
come to make 

Angie Lin money - and, 
with each passing 
Olympics, I real-

ize more and more that nothing 
will ever compete with the Dream 
Team. 

Looki ng over the 2008 roster, I 
don't see any sign of this season's 
dominating players, such as Tim 
Duncan, Vince Carter or Shaquille 
0' eill. Even though I'm not a huge 
fan of Allen Iverson, the man wasn't 
even asked to tryout fo r the team 
- and to think that two years ear-
lier, he and Duncan were two of the 
few all-sta rs who even had the heart 
to pave the road with a 10 ing run 
in Australia. 

For that, I have to give Iverson 
a little re pect and feel a little out-
raged that he wa n't eve n given 
the opportunity to earn a spot on 
the team. It 's just sad to see this

No. 21 UCS~ Splits With GCU

a 5- 1 win in the second game to 
improve to 14-10 on the season. 

The Tritons traveled to Arizona 
for the nonconference doublehead-
er coming off four-straight league 
games versus No. 7 Cal State Los 
Angeles and began the first game 
against the Antelopes with the ame 
powerful offense that carried them 
to three wins over the Eagles. 

The offense gave senior starting 
pitcher Jo e Navarro some breath-
ing room, scoring a run in the flrst 
inning and adding two in the second 
and one more in the third_ for ~ 4-0 
lead. Grand Canyon would fll1ally 
get to avarro for a run in the bot-

tom of the fourth , only to watch as 
the Tritons put together another hit 
barrage an inning later to regain 
their four-run lead at 5- 1. 

Navarro kept his gem going 
through six innings but ran into 
trouble in the bottom of the sev-
enth, allowing a two-run double to 
Antelopes' centerficlder Brian Smith. 
Grand Canyon would go on to add 
two more in the inning for a 5-5 tic 
going into the eighth. The Tritons 
could not regain the lead in their half 
of the eighth inning, but would sacri -
fice the go-ahead run to the Antelopes

GREG DIlLE/GU"'RDI"'N 
Junior Kri tin Bronowicki and doubles partner Kate McKee's efforts were not enough to put the 
Tritons over the three-time defending Division-11I champion Emory University on March 14. 

Bright spot in loss 
comes from No.1 
UCSD doubles pair's 
triumph over Emory 
in SeC tle.

In the usually calm sanctuary 
of Northview Tennis Courts, one 
might have found junior Kristin 
Bronowicki hurling both expletives 
and her racket in frustration at her 
own play on March 14. 

Bronowicki , who plays tennis 
with an obvious fervor, partnered 
with junior Katie McKee to over-
come Emory University's Richelle 
Marasignanin and Jamie Chan in 
an exci ting 9-7 vic tor y. The match 
featured several huge rallies, a num -
ber of unforced errors and a come-
from -behind win for the Tritons. 

However, the hard-earned dou -
bles victory was not enough for 
UCSD to overcome the three-time 
defending Division - III champion 
Eagles, who won the series 5-4 in 
a four-and-a-half-hour battle. The 
Tritons dropped four o[ six singles 
matches, with No. 5 sophomore 
Molly ullens defeating Samantha 
Shapiro 6-0, 7-5, and No.6 sopho-
more Justine Fonte edging out Jenny 
Moscato 7-5, 2-6, 7-6, to provide 
the lone tallies in individual play. 
In doubles play, junior Marsha 
Malinow and freshman Ina Dan 
tomped their opponents by a score 

of 8-2, Fonte and Sullens could not 
match their singles results, falling 
in a duel against Linda Tien and 

Moscato, 8-5. 
Fonte was notably impressive, a 

she came back from a 4-2 deficit in 
the third set of her singles match to 
raise her individual record to 5-0. 

According to head coach Liz 
LaPI.1I1te, the Trit()n~ hattie aomi 
{dbl . 

'V\e, of cour e, would have ilk d 
to win the match , but it was very 
close," she said. "Three of the single 
matches were in the third se t, and 
we needed to win two to win the 
match:' 

T he match of the day was 
undoubtedly the No. 1 doubles 
contest, which pit Bronowicki and 
McKee against Marasignanin and 
Chan. After a quick start that put 
the Tritons ahead 2-0, Marasignanin 
and han fought back to tie the 
score at 2-2. U SO seemed to lose 
its composed form from earlier in 
the match, and at several points, 
a clearly fr ustrated Bronowicki hit 
the court with her racket and paced 
while muttering self-motivating 
criticisms. 

Bronowicki explained her actions 
as her method to compose herself. 

''I'm not very contained emo-
tionally in any way:' she said. "I let 
it out, and then I move on:' 

LaPlante agreed that Bronowicki 
played with unabashed passion, but 
added that Bronowicki is playing 
well. 

"She was a little more emotional 
[on March 14)," LaPlante said_ "But, 
she has been playing excellent dou-
bles and is getting her singles game 
back after being in Rome all last 
quarter_" 

The situation did not improve 
for. the Tritons in the fifth game of 

the match , as Emory sprang ahead 
after several errors by UCSD. McKee 
struggled with her serves, double 
faulting twice and ingle faulting on 
three other occasions. She eventu -
ally got the ball over the net, but 
Emorv. nt it back every time, tak-
ing a 3-2 lead In the process. 

Despitt: losing th ree- traight 
games, McKee and Bronowicki refo-
cused their efforts. 

"It wa n't our strongest perfor-
mance:' Bronowicki said. "But. we 
have a trong desire, and it comes 
out in our tennis." 

After a brief huddle and an 
exchang of support , the Tritons 
bounced back and evened the score 
at 3-3. Their comeback was short-
lived, however, as Emory responded 
with a win to retake the lead. The 
next two games had similar result , 
with the Tritons surging forward to 
equalize but Emory beating them 
back. 

In the lOth game, Bronowicki 
and McKee amplified their inten ity, 
charging forward in an attempt to 
regain the lead. Facing the pros-
pect of falling by two games, U SD 
engaged Emory in a dizzying rally, 
in which both teams sent the ball 
back over the net no less than 10 
times. Finally, Emory faltered, lob-
bing the ball high over the net. 
Bronowicki, realiZing the magnitude 
of the point, rushed the net and 
swatted the ball beyond the reach of 
the hapless Eagles. 

From there, UCSD surged 
ahead to 7-5, but Emory proved 
difficult to put down, as it clawed 
back to push the game to 7-7. The
