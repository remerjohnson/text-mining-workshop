Pope's shooting had 
exotic cultural origin 

BY WILLIAM BEEMAN 
The motive for the 

shooting of Pope John Paul II 
by Mehmet Ali Agc a 
continues to elude a 
bewildered world. Some 
explanations focus on the 
assailant, characterizing him 
as a "perfect terrorist." as 
though that were some 
species of humanity. driven 
by nature to irrational 
attacks on political and 
religious leaders. Others 
focus on the state of the 
world. claiming that 
somehow violence is 
hovering in the air, waiting to 
descend on one and all, low 
and high, in these troubled 
times. 

Both of these explanations 
have the unreal quality of 
myth. elevating the event to a 
supernatural level. A 
satisfactory answer will 
never arise from such 
ephemera. In the end. the 
complex social and cultural 
matrix that produced Agca 
the Turk. Agca the Moslem, 
and ultimately Agca theman. 
must be carefully examined 
in order the even approach a 
realistic explanation for his 
acts. 

The searach for that 
explanation naturally begins 
in Turkey , which was 
literally the center of the 
Islamic world for five 
centuries. The Ottoman 
Sultan was the caliph of the 
faith - the religious center 
for all Moslem believers. But 
with the defeat and the 
dismemberment of the 
Ottoman Empire in World 
War I, the glory of the Turks 
was in total eclipse. 

The nation emerged again 
in 1923 under the leadership 
of the powerful reformer 
Kemal Ataturk, whose 
centennial birthday was 
celebrated ·this May 19. 
Ataturk served as inspiration 
for virtually all 20th-Century 
leaders in the Islamic world. 
But his rescue of Turkey 
from the depths of destruc-
tion and dismemberment had 
a price attached . It was 
secularism. Turkey was to 
rise again, but as a secular 
state rid of the trappings of 
religion. Religious courts

News Service. 

were disestablished, Moslem 
clergymen were forbidden to 
wear traditional dress, and 
t he religiou s education 
system that had prevailed for 
centuries was replaced by a 
modern , Europeanized 
system. Most important of 
all , language reform 
substituted Latin script for 
the Arabic script in which the 
Holy Koran was written, and 
purged the Turkish language 
of Arabic and Persian loan 
words. Turkey was trans· 
formed almost overnight 
from the center of the Islamic 
universe to an outcast state 
on the fringes of Islam, 
radically separated from its 
cultural and religious past. 

All of this would have been 
fine had Turkey been able to 
achieve the greatness 
Ataturk felt was its due as a 
nation . Sadly, its once 
promising economy has slid 
into a bottomless pool of red 
ink: With few native oil 
resources. it has had a 
difficult time sustaining its 
fledging industries. Constant 
inflation has led to continual 
devaluation of the Turkish 
lira, and the currency 
restrictions limiting imports 
have struck so deep that even 
Turkish coffee is no lon~r to 
be found except in bootleg 
coffee shops. 

The Arab states of the 
Middle East that suffered 
long under the Ottoman yoke 
are ill-disposed to help the 
Turks, particularly s ince the 
state officially eschews Islam 
as a political and social force. 

It is against this backdrop 
that polictical unrest gave 
rise to extremist political 
factions throughout Turkey. 
Though they seem bent on 
total destruction , their 
factions are united in one 
overriding goal: the revival of 
the Turkish nation. The left 
seeks its solution in 
Marxism. The right - from 
which Agca apparently drew 
his political inspiration -
espouses a fervent Turkish 
zealotry opposing both the 
West and the Soviet Union, 
which are seen as having 
destroyed Turkey's great· 
ness in the pas t. 

The Turkish government 
itself seems desperate to 
admit to all possibilities for

An exile comes home 
The sensation of exile. that 

intense loss of home and 
native culture, is a deeply 
emotional experience in 
which even the most si mple 
everyday images from the 
past become vivid and as 
precious as oxygen. Despite 
the homogenous character of 
the United States, there are 
certain places where the land 
demands total loyalty from 
its people, enforcing it in 
ways which often do not 
respond to rational explana-
tion. San Diego is and 
remains just such a place. 

During the past year of 
servitude in the land-locked 
Midwest, my small group of 
California expatriates 
contented themselves with 
such minor details like where 
to find fresh seafood and 
jalapeno sauce. The reality of 
an ordered small - town 
culture. of streets with 
sidewalks, large porches and 
neighbors who knew you, 
provided each of us with a 
measure of shelter. Yet it was 
little solace for a home the 
meaning of which we could 
barely explain to our rural 
friends. 

During the long months of 
emptiness the call of the land 
was never direct. Instead it

tion. 

whispered softly, appearing 
in a dream of clouds which 
only materialized on the day 
of my return. The Greyhound 
bus had just reached 4000 
foot elevation point near 
Campo in the East County 
after a long mountain climb 
up from the desert plain of 
the Imperial Valley. There · 
we met an enormous thick 
wet cloud bank which 
obscured the approaches to 
the West and reduced 
visibility to less than a mile. 
Our bus t hen descended to 
the city passing through a 
landscape more believable on 
Venus than in California. 

The appearance of such a 
distinctly coastal weather 
pattern t his far inland 
underlined both the time 
spent away from the sea as 
well as its lure which had 
brought me back. The entire 
notion of'land's end,' where a 
continent surrenders itself to 
the crashing of waves and to 
the sandy s lope of the 
continental shelf, is as 
hypnotic as a mirage and as 
addictive as any opiate. It is 
one of the many qualities 
which links California with 
the Land of the Lotus Eaters 
in Homer's Odyssey. To stand 
near the ocean and be aware 
of the movement of the 
currents, the upwellings 
from the sea floor, and the 
migrations of whale and 
porpoise demands complete 
reverence. Touching one's 
fingers to the sea water that 
laps up to one's feet is like 
probing the, blue blood · 
stream of the earth itself. 

One can touch life, invisible 
life, here like nowhere else. 

The weather, ironically. is 
our only co nstant. Its 
warmth all year dissolves 
any notion of ti me, place and 
tradition which is supported 
by the triumphant division of 
sea ons elsewhere in the 
country. San Diegans say 
manana and take their 
afternoon s iesta in the mid· 
day heat. They await the 
next day with the knowledge 
that the sunshine will be 
stronger than yesterday's. 
They scarcely notice the light 
falling of leaves in the fall, 
leaving it to the winds of the 
desert Santa Ana to blow 
them off the streets. 

This city has always been

weather. The great South 
Pacific storms which lash the 
Mexican coast each year as 
far north as Ensenada 
always lose their strength on 
the approach to the

PCBs found leaking at Med School 
Authorities say there is no threat to humans, will clean up 'soon' 

BY LISA ULLJVAN 
Associate News Editor 

PCB has been leaking from 
two transformers in the 
basement of the Medical 
School's Bas ic Science 
Building ince Friday. but 
campus officials s aid 
yesterday that the problem is 
under control. 

"There is absolutely no 
danger to anyone ," said 
Public Information Officer 
Paul West. The spillage thus 
far has been so slight that a 
person "would have to drink 
the stuff" to be harmed , he 
s aid. 

The spillage will be cleaned 
up today by the IT 
Corporation, which special· 
izes in disposing hazardous 
materials. 

The leaks were discovered 
last Friday by a journey man 
e le ctricia n during an 
examination of about 100 
cam pu s transformers , 
acording to Physical Plant 
Supervisor Jim Gavin. 

The transformers are st ill 
leaking PCB a1through no t at 
a " running" pace, sa id 
Superintendent of Bu ilding 
Maintenance Bill Pettus. 

The transformers will be 
fixed in the " near future, " he 
said. after the IT Corp. 
quotes the cost of repairs. 

Repairs are not extremely 
urgent, he said, because of 
the slowness of the leak, 
wh ich have only caused 
small puddles of "a couple of 

ounce here. and a couple 
ounces there." 

PCB s. polychlorinated 
bipheyl . were first intro· 
duced in the U in 1929 for 
use in electrical equipment. 
but Congre s banned their 
further production in 1977 

after animal tests indicated 
that PCBs could cause such 
health problems as cancer. 

A new chemical proces to 
destroy PCBs won its fir t 
approval Tuesday from the 
Environmental Protection 
Agency - a process which 

convert the sub tance to a 
harm Ie ludge by stripping 
the biphenyl of their 
chlorine atoms. 

However. this proce s will 
not be used in taday 's clean 
up aid Gavin, because t he 
process is handled by just one 

company. the Sunohio Corp. 
of Canton. Ohio. 

Gavin has contacted the 
Sunohio Corp. regarding the 
new process, but he said that 
IT Corp. will probably use 
"rags and kerosene" to wipe 
up the present mess. 

DC fee hike approved by senate 
BY RICK DOWER 

Sacra me nto Correspondent 
Students ' fee at t h e 

University of California , 
already chedu led to go up, 
will increase by about $100 
more next year under 
"emergency" action taken by 
a State Senate committee. 

The financial noose s lipped 
yet tighter around the 
university's neck Tuesday 
night as a senate finance 
subcommittee voted to slash 
another $40 million from 
UC's state operating budget 
from 1981·82. 

Subcommittee chairman 
Walt Stiern said the cuts are 
necessary "to share the 
misery. " 

The Senate action, which 
at this point will probably be 
followed by the rest of the 
legis lature, would shift about 
$13 million from direct 
student services now funded 
by the state over to studen t 
fees . 

That works out to an 

increase of about $100 over 
the next academ ic year for 
each of UC 's 135,000 
students.d 

The university administra· 
tion and UC Student Body 
Presidents' Council and the 
Student Lobby agreed join t ly 
in advance to accept student 
fees increases to s tave off 
possible worse alternatives. 

"Our feeling is t hat in a 
time of critical cris is we 
ought to be able to come 
together and present a united 
front to the legislature, said 
Student Lobby Co-director 
Paul Rogers. 

The Assembly Ways and 
Means Committee still has to 
act on final cuts to UC's 
budget. but it appears likely 
that it, scheduled to meet 
Friday, will follow the 
Senate's lead. Most of the last 
minute reductions came at 
the recommendation of the 
s tate legis lat ive analyst, 
whose office works for both 
houses. 

The legislature's drastic 
budget action is in respon e 
to a n unprecedented 
financial crunch caused by a 
$1. 7 billion shortfall needed 
to balance the state's 
checkbook next year . 

UC As s istant V ice 
President Bill Baker called 
t he late t cuts "terribly 
painful" and said this year 
has turned out to be the 
gloomiest for the univer ity 
in memory. 

UC now will probably wind 
up with no increase or even a 
net decrease in state funding, 
nowhere near Gov. Jerry 
Brown's original 3.9 percent 
increase of $1.078 billion 
proposal. 

The hike in s tudent fees 
would not take effect until 
winter Quarter of 1982 and 
would s till have to be 
accepted by the Board of 
Regents. UC officials already 
expect to increase the 
registration fee next year by 
$40 million to make up for 

inflation. 
Education fee, the other 

component of the charges 
each UC st udent pays 
Quarterly is also scheduled to 
be raised $50 a year starting 
next winter because of 
inflation. That charge has 
remained $100 a Quarter 
ince 1970. 

Money for the reg fee goes 
to fund direct student 
services while the ed fee is 
used mainly for student 
fi nancial aid. UC charges no 
tuition, which would be used 
to pay instructional 
expenses. 

Taken together, all the 
increases mean that by 
spring Quarter of next year , 
com bined student fees would 
total about $320 a Quarter. or 
$960 for the academic year, 
compared to a current $760 a 
year. 

The increase would mark 
the first time fees have edged 
over the $300 per Quarter

The Pope's shooting had its 
roots in exotic culturalislll 
continued from page 2 
political motives in Agca's 
case, save one - that his 
actions might have been 
fueled by identification with 
Islam as a central facet of 
Turkish nation ali t feeling. 
To admit to such a possibility 
would be to deny all of the 
achievements of Ataturk. It 
would be, in fact, a denial of 
the modern Turkish state. 

Yet all indications are that 
Islam was one of Agca 's 
touchstones. His brother has 
been quoted as saying that 
the Pope was attacked 
because Mehmet Ali was 
convinced that Christians 
had imperiali tic designs on 
the Moslem world. Agca 
himself wrote to the Turkish 
papers at the time of the 

Rally for 
Tolbert 

A rally protesting the 
Hi story Departm ent 's 
announcement that it will 
not support Black Studies 
history professor Emory J. 
Tolbert in his efforts to 
receive tenure will be held 
today at noon on the Main 
Gym step. 

Promoter of the 
informational rally have 
urged student to "join us 
in the fight against 
injustice." They contend 
that the History Depart-
ment's action is racially 
di scriminatory , while the 
History Department ays 
that Tolbert ha not met 
the pecified requirements 
of re earch scholar hip 
nece sary for tenure. 

Pope's visit to Istanbul in 
1979 that John Paul II must 
be killed because he was sent 
as a "crusader commander" 
by Western imperialists who 
fear Turkey's efforts to forge 
an alliance with other Islamic 
nations. 

Agca 's choice of the 
crusades as a metaphor for 
his antipathy for the Pope is 
neither idiosyncratic nor 
accidental. Turkey alone, of 
all the Islamic nations, has 
kept the crusades alive in its 
popular culture. Films on the 
c ru sader theme (wit h 
Christians as the bad guys) 
are the equivalent of 
American westerns, and 
popular li terature abounds 
with the exploits of the 
soldiers of Saladin, who 
repulsed the greatest 
crusader invasion. 

Moreover, southeastern 
Turkey, from whence Agca 
comes, is one of the most 
mixed ethnic and religious 

areas of the world. Christian 
Armenians and Assyrian , 
Shi'ite Moslem Alawis, and 
Sunni Muslim Kurds, Turks 
and Arabs all inhabit thi 
s mall region . Confli ct 
between all of these groups 
has occurred regularly over 
the past few centuries. It is 
the area of Turkey least 
affected by the forces of state 
secularization, and least 
controlled by central military 
authority. 

In the end, religion - more 
than Western notions of 
conventional politics - must 
be recognized as a central 
theme in the motives that 
spurred the attempted 
assassination. And the 
religiously inspired Iranian 
Revolution must also be seen 
as a force behind the motives, 
especially since Agca chose to 
make his escape from Turkey 
through the Islamic Repub-
lic . 

An exile returns 
each 4.0 Richter scale 
earthquake rippling through 
their living rooms as if it were 
just another sonic boom. 

Californians know and 
love their land , but they don't 
neces arily know those 
people who come here from 
across the country to share 
its fruits. Our relationship to 
the ea. canyons, mountains 
and desert , acce 'sible only 
along endle streams of re-
inforced concrete highway, 
eliminates any real notion of 
community. The suburb 
(and the UC campus itself) in 

which we live are clustered 
on mesa tops like islands 
adrift. We must swim the 
channels between these 
islands to find friend hip and 
love. Every year this sea 
claims the lives of those who 
cannot learn to swim in the 
life tIye which exists only 
here. Coming home after a 
year in a more stable part of 
the country only reminds me 
of this danger. Yet the exile 
refuses to trade it for 
anything else. He prays to the 
ea for guidance before 

walking in and di vi ng 
headfirst before the fir t 
cra hing wave.

The writing on the wall had a few problems because of people following us screwing up what we had just painted. (The costs 
exceeded the planned $5,000) 
because much of our time 
was spent redoing what 
someone had undone," 
Pettu aid. 

continued from page 1 
livingroom couch. 

Dragon hasn't made many 
treks to HSS and P&L 
stairwells since his friend, 
Touchstone, transfered to 
UC Santa Cruz . "I guess that 
my life has been going well 
enough that I haven't needed 
to make that perso nal 
journey by myself," Dragon 
said, adding that UCSD's 
"cold" environment wa a 
major reason why Touch· 
stone and several other of 
Dragon's friends have left 
San Diego. 

"The environment (here at 
UCSD) is not conducive to 
people," Dragon said. "It's 
more conducive to machines 
- which are more willing to 
follow orders. " 

And a iot of graffiti on the 
walls of HSS agrees with his 
sentiment. 

UCSD: A n academic 
Shopping mall 

This school is omnivorous 
- it'll take any th ing and turn 
it into shit. 

Dragon is figuratively a 
schizophrenic: one side of 
him is deeply involved in 
being an EECS major while 
the other half of him enjoys 
novels of Sir Walter Scott and 
poetry. "(Being an EECS 
major) wants me to restrict 
myself ... my action s ... to 
maintain a highly ordered 
existence ... to believe that 
everything runs on science-
which is only half true," he 
said, adding that the 
"mystical side of human 
nature" often romes out in 

his wall writing. 
But, the quest ion has been 

asked many times: Why 
writeon the walls when there 
are 'legitimate' ways to 
express one's feelings? 

"Literary magazines are 
limited to only those who are 
willing to go over and pick it 
up - which is not a very 
large group of people - as 
opposed to the random person 
who catches his eye on the 
wall. They can ignore it or 
they can read it. 

"(Wail writing is simply) 
being able to communicate to 
people in a way that they 
could listen without having 
to consider the speaker -
which takes a lot of the 
prejudice out of the reading. 
They (the readers) do the 
natural thing people do and 
classify the person (writer) as 
someone you like, don 't like, 
(or) think is interesting. (A 
reader) is less likely to be 
prejudiced to anonymous 
writing on the wall." 

'Experienced wall writers 
have their own language: 
'paint scrubbers' are those 
who paint the walls, 
'regulars' are those who wall 
write more than once or 
twice, and 'tourists' are just 
the opposite of 'regulars'. 
"Tourists write 'Kilroy was 
here' and 'Kill the Shaw'," 
explained Dragon. "Regulars 
write poetry."

blue, and the graffiti is 
sparse, colorful and diverse. 

I guess it's just my 
paranoia 
But those beady little eyes 
are getting to me. J 
mean, 
do they have 10 hang 
from the ceil£ng like 
that? 
There is a cold draft 

blowing down from the top of 
the st airwell. 

What would the little 
prince think of this? 
Dragon walks up the stairs 

very slowly, reading all the 
graffiti on the concrete wall. 
How do people feel about his 
graffiti? It depends on the 
person's open-mindedness, 
he says. 
If you try to cleanse 
others -
like soap you will waste 
away 
in the process. 

Earlier Dragon clim bed to 
the top of a P&L stairwell, 
where he crouched on the 
floor and brus hed the dirt 
from an old graffito of his. 

"There's not a whole lot of 
traffic up here_ or a lot of 
teachers to complain about it 
(the graffiti)," said Dragon. 

In the meantime he took a 
pen from his pocket and 
began to write: 

Dragon has returned to 
the old 
broken hotel, but just for 
a while 
I'm only weeping for the 
way things 
were - before the decay 
of 

man's soul set in. 
Dragon 5/20 

Later Dragon walked down 
a different stairwell to the 
P&L basement. 
Enter The Crypt 

The writing was almost 
entirely in. black magic 
marker and, what drawings 
there were, were all of things 
like tomb tones. The place 
has an eerie atmosphere 
about it. 

The door is open 
And the wind is howling 
A nd I Question myself. .. 
Finally, Dragon walks to a 

connecting corridor at the 
bottom of an HSS stairwell. 
Welcome to the 'Tombz' 

He opened the door to the 
cramped hallway filled with 
colorful graffiti. "This has 
improved considerably ," 
Dragon commented, pointing 
to a large, burning Chemistry 
book drawn on the wall. The 
secluded nature oft he Tombz 
apparently allow s wall 
writers the chance to get in to 
"extensive projects." 

Hell, walls are only as 
contahling 
as you make them. Use 
your imagination. 

Nemo 11/25 
Of cour e, not everyone is 

so receptive to the idea of 
u ing one's imagination on a 
wall. According to Bill 
Pettus, Senior Supervisor of 
Building Maintainence, the 
UCSD administration spent 
in excess of $5,000 to repaint 
the walls of P&L. A special 
anti-graffiti paint was used 
and "the whole project took 
around a couple of weeks. We 

"We squeaked long enough 
and loud to the administra-
tion," commented Vivian 
Merrit, Management Service 
Officer, 'that with the help of 
(Muir Provost) John Stewart 
we managed to get someone 
to do something about it (the 
graffiti). " 

Two graduate students in 
Linguistics, whose depart-
ment is located in P&L, had 
very negative things to say 
about the graffiti. 

" I don 't like it," 
commented Don Seeley. "It's 
obvious that there are people 
who feel very strongly both 
ways about graffiti. (But) 
some of the stuff is just too 
obscene. If you're bringing 
your relatives or friends (up 
to HSS), it doesn't leave a 
very good impression about 
the intellectual atmosphere 
here. " 

Commented Jean Casad, 
also a graduate student in 
Linguistics, "I sure as heck 
would like a paintbrush to 
wipe t hat stuff off the wall." 

"Those people who call 
(our graffiti) an eyesore are 
the ones who close their eyes 
- who insist on a sterile 
environment: 'This is a wall, 
therefore, it must be blank," 
Dragon said, putting the pen 
back into his pocket. 

A nd take heart tlwse 
simple words: 
A cry, on lhe wall, is, 
nonetheless, heard

.+.t.nek CIty: When this tlIle of lost 

<:teams and frustrations in the samblirs 
mecca of the Atlantic seaboard ended, 
I realized that I had enjoyed it. But I 
wasn't sure why. People do thirss fa 
little discernable reason. Scenes cut to 
and fro without logical pottem. But, still, 
it was nice. Directa Louis Malle has 
constructed a movie that is at once a 
satire on the plastic madness that is 
Atlantic City and a ~thetic look 
into the dreams of the city's inhabitants. 
Susan Sarondon is brilliant, as al~, in 
her role as a yours woman who wants 
to becane a professional cord dealer 
and delll her wrry to Europe. Burt 
Lancaster is equally fine as an old minor 
league thug playing out the strirs as a 
house servant to a bed-ridden old 
gll!mour queen. Whatever the reason, 
the movie is worth seeing. 

,....,.1 Rebert Altman's original 
decision to make a live·action movie 
with the "Popeye" character seeme:d 
strange. After all, the baddest SCliia man 
of them all has been a smash success in 
animation and the comic strips. But it's 
not easy to make the jump from 
cartoons to "real life." Somehow or 
dher, though, Altman pulled it off. This 
movie has the off-the-wall, whimsical air 
that characterized the best of the old 
Fleisher Studio cartoons. RobinWilliams 
is incorrigible and incomprehensible as 
Popeye, the man on a quest to find his 
long lost pappy. Shelley Duv!!11 is 
clumsy and loveabieasOliveOy/. They, 
along with the other actors -
especially the loonies lurlcing in the 
deep back.grounds - give the movie 
the wierd, mythic quality it needs. 

EJalIbun People may nOITnCIlly 
associate the sword Exclllibur and 
Camelot 'with Kirs Arthur and lancelot 
(a, perhaps, with Richard Burton). Bu~ 
after they see this movie, they should 
automatically think (:J Merlin, the 
magician and power behi nd the throne. 
Nicol Williamson, as Merlin, is the touch 
that "lIows John Boorman's film to rise 
Ibcwe the crowd. SUre the specll!l 
effects In nice, the battles realistic, the 
men handsome and lllliiant. the'NOlTlen 
beautiful - in other words, the 
Arthurian legend brought forth 
IICcurately - but, without Merlin, this 
wouldn't be a potential classic. The 
sure test is in the latter 5tc19CS of the 
story, when Merlin is missing from the 
scene. Things really s/cwl at that point. 
&t, thanks to WilliClmsoo's M6lin, who 
is at tums m)Stical, ll'iglttnirs and 
vulnerable, this is a definite "don't 
miss" movie. 

lralcct MonInt: Bruce Beresfad, 
who also directed "The Gettirs of 
Wisdom" and "Mt ~illiantCareer," has 
come up with a mCllVelous anti-war 
movie this time:. But to label "Breaker 
Mcrant" as just an ant~war movie is like 
ca/lirs "Gone With The Wind" a story 
about the Civil Waf. This tale of three 
Australian Bushv~ldt Carbineers 
charged with war crimes in the Boer 
Wars is much more than that. It is also a 
sensitNe study of human emotions, of 
the brute political tides that sweep up 
three soldiers and cilTied them down 
the Ri-..er Sly>(, as it \i'o'ere. Edward 
Woodward, certainly one of the more 
underrated talents around, heads the 
cast as "Breaker" t.'orant, the soldier-
pod who IS held most respoflSlble fa 
the "w"r crimes." Beyond the top-
notch acting, the pacing by Ber~sford, 
as he switches the action back and fath 
between the war and the courts·martial 
trio I, keeps buildirs the tension up to 
the ~)(plosive conclusion. Everythirs -
the technical aspects, the script, the 
actirs - comes together to make this 
the best mcwi~ of the year, so far. 

Taa: Nastassio Kinski, as Tess of the 
D'Urbervi lies, is a w:lrren who arr,t 
decent man would gNe his soul fa. 
With dark, expressNe eyes and full 
mouth, she is the soul of this mOo/ie, the 
reason it ultimately succeeds. Of 
course, Roman Polanski - in a radical 
departure from his usual type of movie 
- does a fine job in brirsirs the 
Tromas Hardy novel of /ewe and 
hypocrisy to the screen. The rank 
inj ustices of late 19th century Eng land 
blend \i'o'ell with the beautiful, endurirs 
countryside. But if Kinski didn't exist, 
Polanski would haw. had to in.-ent her. If 
the actress playirs Tess isn't someone 
the audience can care fa, no one 
would sit through this three-hour 
retellirs of her traIIIIils at the hands of 
lustful, heartless me:n and an uncarirs 
society. By all means see this, the best 
mc:Me (:J 1980. 

Ouilllnd: 1f)QU like Sean Con, ery, if 
)OU like Westerns, if you like science 
fiction, you'lI like "Out/and." You see, 
this mcwie is blantant about beirs a 
Western set in spac~ (on 10, a moon of 
Jupiter, to be precise). Connery, craggy 
and w:lnderful as usual, is the federal 
marshal det~rmine:d to stop the 
mysterious deaths at a mining 
operation. The bad guy, played by 
Peter Boyle, is so determined to stop 
him that he sends for some out-of·town 
gunsl ingers to blow him away. 
Connery's charact~r comes directly 
from the lonely, gutty, supremely 
determined cCM'boy-actors of the past, 
men like Gary Cooper and Alan Ladd. 
Only the accent has changed, . from flat 
midwestern America to rich Scottish. 
"Outland" is slick, suspenseful and 
excitirs· 

~ How: Francis Coppola 
adapted a Joseph Conrad short story 
called "The Heart of Darkness," set it in 
the Vietnam War and came up with a 
brilliant, terrifying and mysterious 
movie. Martin Sheen heads the cast in 
his role as an Anmy aSSCIssin adered to 
kill Marlon Brando, who pl¥ an 
American colonel who abandoned his 
command and set himself up as a god-
figure for the ""tives a nd other 
misbegotten souls In Combodia. Most 
(:J the film concerns Sheen's trip 
through vietnam to Saigon, first by 
helicopter - the scene where Robert 
Owall's helicopter caps takes a beach 
because the waves fa surfirs is a 
classic - and then by boat. Once 
Sheen getS to Brando's hideout things 
slow a bit, but not even 8rando's 
ponderous CNeractirs could put a 
damper on the movie's OIIe1'all quality .. 

...., ItIwaII: Stort with Gene 
Wilder, who has made the trar6ition 
from ZClrr,t Mel Brooks type to a more 

urba~ comic style. Toss in Richard 
Prya, with his big soulful eyes and

Lynette Tom/Film 

'Outland' has its 
technical flaW's 

It's been a long time since 
I've seen a film with a group 
of friends. and Ouiland 
seemed to be the perfect 
picture for the occa ion . 
They left the theater 
grumbling something about 
sloppy matte shots, grainy 
film, and second rate special 
effects. As for me, well, I was 
always somewhat of the 
oddball In the group. I 

of people expand and explode 
into a bloody pulp. The grisly 
results get their share of 
horrified reaction from the 
audience, but I que 'lion it ~ 
reali m. 

The Gua rrl ian 9 

thought Outland was a pretty 
good movie ... with a few 
minor reservations. 

The tory. for the most 
part , was stimulating. O'Niel 
is the new marshall for a 
space mining tat ion in 10, 
one of Jupiter 's twelve 
moons. A couple of miners 
freaking out di sturb hi 
otherwise mooth routine. 
An investigation ensue and 
exposes the illegal use of a 
drug capable of increa ing 
productivity in the workers. 
The only problem with it is 
that the users go on a 
psychotic rampage after a 
while. So, O'Niel initiates a 
one-man campaign to clean 
up the town, so to speak, and 
nab the responsible culprit , 
General Manager Sheppard. 
The plot isn't certainly a new 
one. It 's been used in a dozen 
score of Westerns and at least 
half that amount everywhere 
else. It's precisely because 
the story has been tried and 
proven to be worthy of

Mike Thomas/Film 
All throughout the 

screening, I couldn't help but 
feel a nagging senseof deja vu 
in the back of my mind . The 
science fictionesque composi· 
tions , the addressing of 
character on a last name 
basi and the cluttered, lived-
in interiors of the space 
mining station definitely 

'Morant' nears narcolepsy 

macked of Alien, while the 
unitarian fashions and the 
leisure clu b scenes were 
reminiscent of Star Wars. 

The film even had a catchy . 
prophetic phrase ("Even in 
pace, the ultimate enemy is 

still Man,"), and instead of 
having little multi-toothed 
creatures bursting out of 
people's stomachs, the faces 

My enthusiasm toward the 
film, however, waned a bit 
with respect to the acting. It 
seemed as if ean Connery 
was bored with hi role a 
O'Niel and delivered his lines 
and staged hi s actions 
accordingly, although he did

The road to narcolepsy is 
paved with Au stralian 
celluloid, or so it seems with 
the release of Breaker 
Morant. This movie is a 
prime example of what the 
late master, ir Alf of 
Hitchcock, di missed as 
"non -moving pictures of 
people talking." 

It is a adaptation of a stage 
play and makes the 
transition to film about as 
gracefully as Gerald Ford 
alighting from a helicopter.

'Outland' 
lacking 
continued from page 9 
exchange a few well-placed 
barb with the station' 
doctor, Lazarus, played with 
appropriate grumpine s by 
Frances Sternhagen . The 
same stoic performance went 
for Peter Boyle as Sheppard . 

To be completely honest, I 
didn't notice the matte shot 
or film grain di screpancie 
that my friends found ' 0 
glaring. I did cringe at the 
poor picture resolution of the 
video phone sequence s, 
though, and there were times 
when I thought the 
model work of the space 
mining station was a shade 
better than those Saturday 
morning live-action series on 
television . Be ides, the be t 
scene in the entire picture 
had nothing to do with 
special effect ,at least in this 
sense. 

There was a three to five 
minute chase between O'Niel 
and Spota, one of Sheppard's 
" pushers," that led them 
through the - catacom b 
structures of the living 
quarters, up and over the 
tables of the dining area, and 
in and out of the kitchen. 
Watching the e two move in 
such an arduous task of 
agility was wonderful, but 
seeing the camera make the 
same moves with nary a 
bumpy and blurry image was 
mind-boggling. The scene 
should be placed in the hall of 
fame of chase, right 
alongside the dogfights in 
Star Wars and the car pursuit 
in The French Connection. 

Outland is now playing at 
the Valley Circle Theater. 

'Morant' 
stagnant 
continued from page 9 
including a civi lian . 
Unfortunately, the Brit ish 
were ready to send out peace 
feelers to the Boers, and so 
Morant and two other men 
are deemed expendable by the 
High Command as a sign of 
good faith towards the 
Afrikaans. The court-martial 
is a complete sham, and the 
three men are all convicted in 
a (pardon the pun) kangaroo 
court. Morant and another 
defendant are executed with 
the third given life. (His 
sentence was commuted 
after a few months. There, 
sounds nifty, huh? Well , 
certainly the potential was 
there, and it probably made a 
sti rring piece of theatre, but 
film is something more than 
didactic issues. That's all 
this movie ha to offer. 

It wears its analogy to My 
Lai and the Vietnam war on 
its s leeve. Despite the 
disturbing questions it raises 
about responsibility and 
moral judgements during 
war, as a moving picture it 
remains static and talky. It 
moves at the pace of a koala 
bear on quaaludes. Ulti -
mately, the movie, like the 
war itself, is a Boer. 

" Breaker Morant" is 
currently playing at the

Easton: 
beyond 
'9 to 5 ' 

Sheena Easton is known in 
this country almost solely for 
the song "Morning Train ," 
an unavoidable piece of radio 
fare that tells the story of a 
woman whose man "takes 
the morning train" to work , 
labors there from "9 to 5" (the 
song' original title in 
Britain, for rea sons un-
known), then returns to find 
the lady waiting patiently at 
the station hoping to "catch a 
light" off him - to bask in 
the glow of his manhood , as it 
were. "Morning Train" is an 
in idiously catchy pop tune, 
likeably dumb and reason-
ably innocuou , yet rather 
annoy ing in its seemingly 
(though apparentl y not) 
outdated sexual att itude . 

But Ie t yo u t hink 
"Morning Train" is meant to 
be an accurate representa-
tion of Sheena Ea ton, there 
is included on her eponymou 
debut album a song called 
"Modern Girl. " In this sub-
feminist anthem , the t it le 
character. "an independent 
lady taking care of herself. " 
rides the morning train 
herself (along the way she 
" eat s a tangerine/ Looks 
through a magazine" -
surely an inspired dumb 
couplet). When s he return 
home, the Modern Girl talks 
to her lover on the telephone, 
but she doesn't feel compelled 
to spend the evening with 
him, because, well: "Tonight 
I'm gonna stay at home and 
watch my TV." Boy, talk 
about being liberated! 

Actually neither song 
seems to capture the 'real' 
Sheena Easton, whoever she 
might be. On Sheena Easton, 
the English singer comes 
across as a very capable, 
talented and flexible vocalist, 
ready to handle about any 
assignment put to her. 
Producer Christopher Neil 
has constructed an impres-
sively slick record around 
Easton, an essentially MOR 
effort with significant Pat 
"Hit Me with Your Best 
Shot" Benatar-styled New 
Wave touches. 

The most obvious Benatar-
borrowing on the album is 
"Prisoner," with character-
istic thudding guitars and 
screaming vocals. More 
subtle (and also more 
interesting) is a song titled 
"Take My Time," which 
could well be an an wer to 
PB's version of "[ Need a 
Lover." Where Benatar ays, 
"I need someone who'll thrill 
me, t hen go away," Easton 
professes, "[ need somebody 
to tie me down." (If Benatar 
were to cover "Take My 
Time," she'd probably 
change the line to "tie me 
up" ... ) 

The final song of note here 
is "Cry," with an appealing 
arrangement and still more 
nicely absurd lines: "Cry, 
baby, wash out your 
heartIHang your life out to 
dry .. . " The remainder of 
Slteena Easto1t, however 
pleas aftt , is pretty duH by 
comparison.

_________ ... presents Intramural Sports Shorts-
With the coming of summer, the 

thoughts of Southern Cali fomiacollege 
students b~ome very predictable. In 
no particular order, their minds 
wander back and forth among a 
myriad of summer-time prioritie . 
Getting done with school, finding a 
summer job, traveling abroad, and 
then perhaps, above all, spending 
plenty of time at the beach. 

Yessir you guessed it...got to take 
care of everyone's P-O-T needs. That's 
P-O-T as in play-off-time. You know, 
the cu lmination of another much too 
short IM season. Time to get back to 
basics ... good 01' fashion running, 
throwing, hitting, shooting, jumping 
and spiking. We all know how to do it. 
But now's the time when we need todo 
it better than everybody else or .. . you 
know the alternative ... start looking 
forward to summer. 

Results-----------------------------

Aaah, the BEACH! ... it's so hard not 
to dream about spending endless days 
in the sultry sun doing ab olutely 
nothing. 

But , hold on now ... we're not quite 
there yet. There seems to be some 
unfinished business back at the 01' U 
that needs to be taken care of. 

With two weeks to go, your 
irrepressible Budman thought you 
might enjoy a capsule summary of 
what's going on with the P-OT

university and the students. 

The joint agreement was a 
contrast to the sometimes 
strained relations between 
the lobby and UC officials 
evident in recent months. 

"We worked very hard 
with SBPC and the Lobby on 
this," Baker said. "It's been a 
healthy relationship to try 
together to agree on cuts that 
will be least damaging to the 
quality of the university." 

Baker said each campus 
will share equally the budget 
reductions even through 
various services are funded 
differently from campus to 
campus. 

"We tried to minimize the 
long term impact on 
students," Rogers said of the 
negotiations with the 
university. He said the one 
time fee increase next year, 
though subitantial, would 
help to further diffuse the call 
for tuition by UC or the 
legislature. 

Some student services 
currently funded by the state 
which would be paid out of 
the $13 million in increased 
student fees are financial aid 
and administration, student 
loan collection, affirmative 
action, recreation and social 
activities, counseling and 
housing services. 

The actual savings to the 
state would only amount to 
about $10.5 million from the 

_ bitt, ~nce $2.5 million ofthe 
total would De -niedooOy UC 
for more student financial aid 
because of the higher fees. 

Most of the $27 million 
remainder of the university's 
share of the latest cuts are in 
capital outlay for construc-
tion projects and hospital-
related loans the state wants 
paid back next year. 

The UC president's office 
would lose 5 percent off the 
top of its budget , or $800,000, 
under the Senate action 
Tuesday. That amount i 
equivalent to 40 po ition and 
Baker said he hope to 
accomplish any personnel 
reductions there through 
normal attrition .
