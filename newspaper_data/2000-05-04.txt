Council Calls

Resolution condemns

News Editors 

The A.S. Council voted almost 
unanimously Wednesday nigh t to 
approve a resolution demanding the 
im mediate resignation of A.S. 
President Tesh Khullar, Vice 
President Internal Jennifer Lee and 
Vice President Finance Eric Rovner.

"""-I: Local C V. E. President}udit Murray (right) and Vice President Ky ra RandaU dtlivertd letters to Assistant 
Via Chancellor of HU1fID1I Rtst1ruus Rogers DGIIis at a dem.mslTation Tuesday. 

Despite the passage of the resolu-
tion, the three executives left office 
Wednesday night without resigning. 
The new A.S. Council took office later 
that night as scheduled. 

Khullar said the decision not to 
resign was based primarily on his 
involvement with other student orga-
nizations and the effect his resigna-
tion might have on them. 

Clerical Workers Protest Low 
Wages, Unfair Bargaining "There (would have been) other ramifications if I (had) resigned: Khullar sa id. "When I resign I am no 

longer the representative to a lot of 
the committees I am on, and we lose 
student participation." 

Members of the Coalition of University Employees, joined by 
members of two other union delivered letters to Chancellor Dynes Regardless of the rationale behind 

Khullar's decision, Scott Mantell , 
commissioner of programming, said 
he was disappointed that the three 
executives did not resign . News Editor 

Members of the Coalition of 
University Employees demon-
strated outside Chancellor 
Dynes' office Thesday, delivering 
a letter to Dynes protesting what 
they call unfair bargaining on 
the part of the university. 

C.U.E. members, represent-
ing over 19,000 clerical employ-
ees across the UC system, held 
protests Thesday at chancellors' 
offices on all UC campuses. 

Judie Murray, president of 
the local C.u.E. chapter, said the 

university has failtd to grant 
clerical employees the 6-percent 
raise they have been fighting for 
and last week ·reneged on an 
offer for a 2-percent raise. 

MThey don't bargain in good 
faith , they don't keep their 
word: Murray said. Mit gets 
more and more horrendous 
every time we go to the table," 

She added that the pay of 
clerical workers in the UC sys-
tem is 20 to 30 percent less than 
in the industry. 

Rogers Davis, assistant vice 
chancellor of human resources, 
said he has no data supporting 

that claim. 
He said C.U.E. members 

have been receiving 2 percent 
raises while negotiations were 
underway. 

He added that contract issues 
should not be discussed outside 
of actual negotiations. 

"We have systemwide bar-
gaining going on at the bargain-
ing tables," he said. 
"Bargain(ing) issues in the 
media ... is not a productive 
approach to resolving them."

Holocaust Survivor Speaks During Remembr':lnce Week 
David Faber, survivor eight concentration camps, has pictures from his time in the camps 
By MALAViKA UNeOLLY 
St.ff Writer 

Holocaust survivor David Faber 
spoke Tuesday night in the Price 
Center about his experiences sur-
viving eight concentration camps. 

Faber's speech was one of many 
events taking place this week in 
honor of National Holocaust 
Remembrance Week. 

Faber, speaking to a group 
comprised mostly of UCSD and 
SDSU students, said that as a 
child, he witnessed the Nazi vic-
timization of jews in his native 
country of Poland. Faber spoke 
about Jews who were killed during 
the Holocaust, including his 
mother, father and siblings. 

Faber is one of the few 
Holocaust survivors who has pic-
tures of himself and others from 
his time spent in concentration 
camps. According to Faber, 99 
percent of survivors around the 
world have no pictures by which 
to remember the Holocaust. The 
pictures he showed belonged to 
his late sister, who narrowly 
escaped to England during the 
Holocaust. 

After speaking. Faber signed 
copies of his book, titled "Because 
of Romek: A Holocaust Survivor's 
Memoir." 

This is the third year Revelle 
College Residence Life and the 
University Centen have invited 
Faber to speak to UCSD students. 

On Monday, UCSD's Hillel 
and the Union of Jewish Students 
sponsored a 24-hour name read-
ing, during which people of many 
faiths and cultures read from the 
list of names of over six million 
Jews who were killed during the 
Holocaust. 

The vigil, which began in the 
Price Center Plaza and later moved 
to the second floor of the Price 
Center, drew observers through-
out the day who paid respect to 
those whose lives were taken dur-
ing the Holocaust. 

Warren junior Wade Strauss, 
vice president of the Union of 
Jewish Students, said the event's 
purpose was not only to urge peo-
ple to remember the Holocaust 

but to raise awareness of genocide 
among other ethnic groups as 
well. 

"It is important for us to recog· 
nize that this didn't just happen in 
Nazi Germany, and it did not only 
happen to the Jews, but to inno-
cent people all over the world," 
Strauss said. "This is our way of 
making a statement - that we will 
not forget, and that those who per-
ished will not just be remembered 
as numbers, but as living, breath-
ing, human beings." 

The Holocaust Memorial Flag 
exhibit, located on the Price 
Center lawn, will be displayed as a 
part of the weeklong remem-

Police in riot gear formed a barri-
cade outside the Notre Dame bUIld-
ing, and a few curious students ven-
tured into the demonstration. which 
had proceeded relatively peacefully . 
throughout the morning. 

No(re Dam~ Junior Tom 
Ogorzalek witnessed one of the most 
violent incidents of the day, when a 
McDonald's restaurant in Whitehall 
was smashed and pillaged by anar-
chIsts protesting globalization. 

Because the crowd was composed 
of such diverse protesters. ranging 
from anarchists to environmentalists 
Ogorza lek said the mood of th ~ 
demonstration varied greatly. 

As riot police began closing in on 
the protest, some students found 
themselves trapped in Trafalga r 
Square. Jun ior Laura Guest was 
among those who spent nearly three 
hours behind a police barricade. 

Though she only spent 10 min-
utes in Trafalgar Square. Guest said 
that riot police refused to let her or 
any of the other protesters and 
tourists leave. 

The reason for the three-hour 
internment was so that police could 
check the faces of those leaving 
Trafalgar Square against pictures taken 
during earlier incidents including the 
McDonald's riot, she explained.

CoIdIIIIIed ".. ..... 1 
cially upset that clerical workers 
were not getting adequate raises 
this year, since the state is enjoying 
a large budget surplus. 

She added that Dynes has

C.U.E. members, joined by

CAPP Designed to 
Harass Students 

Recently the San Diego Police 
Department implemented the Community 
Assisted Party Program in areas surrounding 
SDSU and USD. The aim of the program is 
to curb party-related violations of the law by 
"CAPPing" residences that repeatedly dis-
turb the peace. This month, CAPP will come 
to the residential areas surrounding UCSD. 

Residences can be CAPPed in one of 
three ways: as few as five neighbors sign a 
party-related complaint and tum it in to 
their local police department; a specific loca-
tion receives more than one noise distur-
bance complaint in a one-month period; or 
police respond to a complaint and find bel-
ligerent partygo rs engaged in illegal activi-
ties. 

Once a residence is CAPPed, it is subject 
to a zero-tolerance policy for one year. If 
another violation occurs at a residence with-
in the one-year period, the resident can be 
apprehended and his stereo equipment 
seized. 

Janine Watts, a coordinator affiliated with 
the program, has affirmed that any residence 
in violation of CAPP, even "people in their 
fifties throwing a wine and cheese party," 
would be subject to CAPP's repercussions. 
Despite this stipulation, common sense dic-
tates that college students are more likely to 
throw parties with loud music at later hours. 

The Guardian believes that the program 
unfairly targets college students, and its inef-
fectual structure does not make CAPP a 
solution to the problems it is intended to 
solve. 

Watts asserted that CAPP "is not directly 
targeted toward college students." This 
avowal is illogical. Working adults are, by 
nature, less likely to engage in the same 
behavior as their younger neighbors due to 
the lifestyle accorded by the demands of 
working life. A raucous wine and cheese 
party of the degree necessary to bring on the 
:-vrath of CAPP is nearly impossible to imag-
Ine. 

The most obvious indicator of CAPP's 
student-specific harassment is the areas in 
which it has been implemented. If the SDPD 
is concerned about protecting the rights of 
residents everywhere to enjoy peace and 
quiet in their own neighborhoods, CAPP 
should be realized throughout all the areas 
under the SDPO's jurisdiction. Instead, 
CAPP is being targeted at college-area 
neighborhoods where students are likely to 
live, proof of the program's discriminatory 
nature. 

We hope the SOPD and college commu-
nities will work toward a solution that curbs 
disturbances in a nondiscriminatory, cohe-
sive manner.

'Hate-Free Campus Campaign Sorely 
Missed the Support of UCSD's Faculty 
Although there was tremendous student support and a great cast of speakers at the 
rally of the Hate-Free Campus Campaign, not a single faculty member attended 
IJ J .... v IIOIIST 
Contributing Writftr 

On April 24, the inaugural rally for 
the Hate-Free Campus Campaign cre-
ated a unified stand of the cultural, reli-
gious, gender, racial and sexuality based 
student organizations against hate 
crimes that were motivated by homo-
phobia, racism, sexism and prejudice of 
religion and culture. 

Everyon~ that observed and partici-
pated in the rally gained at least one 
new perspective. Inspiration was pro-
vided by a wide spectrum of speakers 
ranging from actor, director, playwright 
and activist Edward James Olmos, to 
professional hip-hop artist Ahjamud 
Jeffers of South East One; and from 
student spoken-word artists Vecjay and 
Dudley Jennings, to representatives of 
the mayor's and governor's office. 
There were even two groups of children 
performers, one of which was from a 
Baha'i Faith group. However, the one 
thing that was missing was a faculty 
presence. 

Fully disregarding the thousands of 
hours that were put into this project by 
students and student services staff, the 
faculty of UCS D, one of the most mod-
ern academic institutions in this coun-
try, unanimously decided that they had 
something better to do than attend 'an 
event that set a precedent and marked 
the beginning of a unified fight against 
hate on college campuses. 

Many members of the faculty 
ignored personal invitations to attend, 
although some responded to the expla-
nation of the cause with interest. They 
also ignored the plea made by students 
to show up in support of those students 
who have received countless threats, 
who have been beaten, tortured and 
raped, who have had their cars 
destroyed or stolen because of their 
sexual preference, and who are subject-

ed to racial, homophobic and anti-
Semitic hate letters in their e-mail 
whenever they hear "you've got mail.w 

For once, this campus celebrated the 
stifled attempt at a multicultural stu-
dent body, shouted encouragement, 
chanted "no more hateW and declared 
that it would no longer tolerate hate on 
this campus, nor would the participants 
tolerate hate in their lives. 

Where were the faces of the profes-
sors that we are all supposed to respect 
so much? Where was their respect for 
us? Where was their support? Why 
could they not devote a couple of hours 
one night of the year, for their students, 
who put in just as many hours for them 
every night? Did they already go to 
their multicultural workshop for the 
year? 

We have all experienced prejudice. 
Many of us have to deal with it on a 
daily basis. The faculty must not under-
stand what it is like to realize that every 
time you walk into a lecture hall, you 
are the only person of your race out of 
the 400 people in the class. If they did 
not know that feeling, why were they 
not at the rally to open their minds and 
learn about what some of their students 
and colleagues go through? 

A great deal of the messages at the 
rally were directed toward the faculty. 
They do not seem to realize that in 
many classes, students are offended and 
hurt by their professors' homophobia, 
sexism and culturism. Many professors 
are aware of these issues and empower 
those who are usually disempowered. 
However, next time they should be at 
the rally in person to actively support 
their students as well. 

I came to this school because of 
what I thought I could learn from this 
school's extremely prestigious faculty. I 
have been a teacher as well, and I have 
learned that half of the teaching aperi-
ence is learning from your students. 

Every single faculty member and stu-
dent that failed to come to the rally 
missed an incredible opportunity to 
learn about the students and what their 
lives are like. 

This is not a subject that is limited 
to one or two departments, for we are 
all human beings, regardless of the aca-
demic subjects we study and teach. We 
are all responsible for listening to the 
words and work of our fellow human 
beings who are treated as something 
less. 

It seems to me that the faculty at this 
school have become removed from the 
rest of the world, save their depart-
ments. If I am wrong, prove me wrong. 
If you can support the movement for 
unity, a multicultural campus free of 
hate and a free environment, go to the 
next rally. Participate in the next collab-
orative art project that represents the 
struggle to be free, to express ourselves 
freely. Make a difference in a student's 
life. Talk to your classes about these 
issues. At least have the self respect to 
ask your class if anyone has ever been 
"Offended in your classroom. You should 
realize that people probably will not 
respond to that question, but at least 
you will have shown them you care. 

Su~port your students, for they are in 
their first stage of their lives without 
!heir parents and in many ways you are 
tilling that role. 

In an effort to. support the message 
of this letter, my beliefs and all those 
who share them, I am committing a 
social action with a one-man protest: I 
am refraining from turning in any 
papers and homework assignments, 
from taking any midterms, quizzes or 
tests for the week of the proclamation 
event. Why should I support the pro-
fessors and administration when they 
ignored my work and did not support 
my struggle? They disempowered me

College Should Not Create Robots 
The university system is geared towards producing cookie-cutter citizens 

Contributirw Writtlt' 

I have been a student for as long 
as I can remember, and a great por-
tion of my life has been spent in the 
classroom. Afrer so many years of 
education, it is only natural that I 
should wonder: "Why have I tor-
tured myself for all these years?" 

Well, theortticaUy, when I grad-
uate I will be wtll-paid, live a happy 
life, have a wife, 2.5 kids, live in the 
suburbs and drive an SUV until I 
tum 50. TIlat's when I will realize I 
won't have done anything fun for 
nearly 30 years. so I'll buy a sports 
car and imagine everything has 
changed. Then at 65, 1'f1 retire and 
play with my grandkids. 

Not too exciting. but it doesn't 
sound too bad. If you think about it, 
this reality will probably hold true 
for the majority of the population at 
this school. We are unwittingly con-
demned to this monotonous, yet 
sup¢iciaJly enjoyable life. Do we all 
want to be the Cleaver family - or 
more realistically, the Bundys? I 
know I don't; yet somehow I am 
unwittingly sniving for it This is 
not a natural urge we were born 
with - we were taught it. 

The conclusion that I came to 
during a particularly stressful finals 
week was that we are all part of a 
huge people machine. UCSD is the 
manufacturing plant; one of many 
that manufactures "well adjustedW 
people for integration into society. 

Okay, so it sounds a little drug-
induced, but bear with me. Take a 
look around you. Think about your 
friends, the random people you see 
on campus and in your classes. 
Notice how similar your friends are 
to you. Make a note of aU the peo-
ple you sec: wearing the same shirt 

or sweater as you when you walk 
around campus. In class, notice all 
the people that have the same blank 
stare as they fervently tty to copy 
down a million words per minute. 

Think about what your assign-
ments are asking you to do. Are you 
encouraged to analyze? To be cre-
ative? Do your c1asses challenge you 
to think about what you are doing. 
or do they ~ so fast that you are 
forced to memorize everything and 
hope you will retain it long enough 
to make it through finals? 

In four years. I've nied three dif-
ferent majors and taken a class 
from nearly every genre offered. It 
has been pathetically depressing. 
Every class is the same. The prof~ 
sors want to teach something and 
the students must learn it the pr0-
fessors' way. We are sometimes 
forced to regurgitate the teachers' 
opinions to ~et a good grade, yet we 
all accept thiS as nonnal. 

When we walk across the stage 
and receive our degree. we will have 
exactly the same education as every 
Tom, Dick and Mary in our respec-
tive fields. The diversity offered by 
the five college system is the only 
thing that differentiates us from 
one another, but out in the real 
world - the machine - these dif-
ferences won't amount to didd1ey 
squat. All of us will get jobs and do 
whatever it takes to get by for the 
rest of our lives. We will udo the 
right thin~.w 

What IS "the right thing?" It is 
what society expects us to do: 
maintain a job. start a family and be 
a law-abiding citizen. School must 
be what prepares you for this dull 
lifestyle, because half the time the 
job you get could be done by a high 
school graduate; except the job 
requires a college diploma. Many 

people don't even enter the field 
they studied in school after they 
graduate. The purpose of your 
diploft'la is to prove that you are a 
person who does uthe right thing." 
You play by the rules and therefore 
you deserve a well-paid job. 

This can't hold for everyone, 
because I am writing this article, 
after all. Am I the black sheep? Do 
I think outside the box? Am I the 
fool on the hill, the lunatic on the 
grass? I don't think so - at least I 
hope not. 

I am writing this because I think 
it's time for a revolution, a mini-
revolution. It is time for everyone to 
break out of their rigid schedules 
and the monotony of day-to-day 
life and, for just one day, break the 
rules. You don't have to get arrest-
ed - just do something a little 
crazy. Ditch a class, wear a clown 
suit, speak backward, jump 
around, dance in a fountain, sing 
aloud, run naked, smell the roses! 
Do something you have always 
wanted to do, but were afraid to. 

Enjoy life for a short moment. 
School sucks and time flies by so 
fast that soon enough we'll all be 
working regular jobs and fun won't 
even be a fart of our vocabulary. 

We wil all become a part of the 
machine: an integral part of society. 
Each of us will playa small role and 
we will keep things running 
smoothly. But if you don't take a 
break and oil your hinges a bit, 
you'll get rusted in place. 

So take a minute - take a deep 
breath and do something wild, and 
when you're done, go back to class, 
smile and actually pay attention to 
what you are being taught. 
Someday you might use it - but, 
probably not.

Overturn Miranda Ruling 
Legal requirement only hinders law enforcement 
IJ SITH WHITAKER 
The Technician (North Carolina 
State) 

(U-WlRE) RALEIGH, N.C. -
In 1966, the Supreme Court 
established a set of guidelines for 
police regarding confessions in 
the landmark case of Miranda v. 
Arizona. 

Thirty years later, if you don't 
know the litany of so-called 
UMiranda rights: then you must 
not have seen any television 
shows or movies lately. Do the 
words "You have the right to 
remain silentW ring any bells? 

A case to be decided within the 
next few months could overturn 
Miranda and send these familiar 
phrases out the window. 

The basic idea behind the 
Miranda rights is that those 
accused of a crime should know 
of their constitutional right not to 
incriminate themselves before 
they are interrogated. I would cer-
tainly hope that they would know 
of those rights. 

However, Miranda has been 
enforced so strictly that the num-
ber of apparently guilty criminals 
who are not convicted because of 
technicalities is appalling. 

There is an issue that goes 
deeper into all this. Allow me to 
illustrate with a not-so-deep 
story. 

Recently, I was enjoying a few 
adult beverages with friends, as I 
am apt to do on the weekends. In 
fact, I was enjoying them in the 
context of a game. 

As we all know, such games 
have rules, and if one of these 
rules is broken, the penalty is to 
partake of more of your chosen 
adult beverage. When I broke a 

rule I did not know, ( protested 
and was met with a violent procla-
mation that "ignorance of the law 
is not an excuse!" aturally, I par-
took of some of my adult bever-
age. ( did not immediately ponder 
the impact of this cliche on 
Miranda - ( did that later, when I 
was sober. 

The rule involved in Miranda 
is, of course, a bit more important 
than the one in my ridiculous 
story. The right not to incriminate 
oneself is written in the Fifth 
Amendment to the Constitution 
of the United States. 

It is so important, in fact. that 
every American ought to know it. 
Ignorance of the law shou ldn't be 
an excuse when it comes to some-
thing like this. 

Our system of public educa-
tion was originally designed to 
create a more informed public. 
Every citizen of a democracy 
needs to understand his or her 
government and basic rights in 
order to be a productive member 
of society, or so the thinking goes 
(and ( happen to agree) . 

Why is it that although every 
American is required to get an 
education until the age of 16, we 
are requiring police officers to 
spoon-feed knowledge that 
should be learned in school to 
those whom they arrest? 

I'm not saying that every 
schoolchild in America should be 
able to write a term paper on con-
stitutional law. I am saying the 
Miranda decision is requiring 
police to educate people about a 
tenet of basic civic education, a 
job that schools are intended to 
do. Not every citizen can be a

The Historical Events Detailed in the Bible Cannot be Tested by Science 
Editor: 
According to Simone Santini 

("Science Cannot Verify the Truth 
of the Bible: April 24), the 
"Christian Bible has been heavily 
edited since well into the middle 
ages, thus creating many opportu-
nities for a posteriori harmoniza-
tion: Scholars addressed this 
exact problem, asking, "How 
accurate are the copies we have 
today? Since the text has been 
copied over many times, can we 
trust it?" 

The Middle Ages extended from 
A.D. 476-1453; thus, in order to 
detennine the accuracy of the Bible 
that we have today, we must com-
pare it to a copy written before this 
time period. 

Until the discovery of the Dead 
Sea Scrolls, the oldest manuscript 
of the Bible was dated around 
A.D. 900, but after the scrolls 
were found in 1947, paleogra-
phers dated them around 125 
B.C., placing the oldest manu-
script of the Bible before the 
Middle Ages. 

Comparing the Dead Sea 
Scrolls to our standard Bible, more 
than 95 percent of the text is word 
for word. The 5 percent variation 
consists of obvious pen slips and 
variations in spelling. These dis-
crepancies do not affect the doc-
trine or teaching of the Bible. Thus, 
we can conclude that the edition of 
the Bible that we have today is 
accurate when compared to the 
original. 

Also, Santini claims that "if 
one wants to judge the Bible on 

scientific grounds, one should 
apply to it the same principles 
that are applied to scientific theo-
ries." In other words, one must 
use the scientific method for 
judging the Bible. 

Although this is a good 
approach for "theories." it is not 
applicable for the Bible. To use the 
scientific method, the phenomena 
must be observable and repeatable. 
Unfortunately, history cannot be 
repeated in order to be observed 
more than once. The validity of 
history does not depend on repeat-
ed experiments. but on the testi-
mony of eyewitnesses of the specif-
ic events. 

For example, we cannot use 
the scientific method to prove 
that Abraham Lincoln was shot 
and killed at the theater, because 
none of us were there to see it 
happen and the event cannot be 
repeated for testing in a lab. We 
must rely on the testimony of 
ones who were there and did 
observe it. 

Now say that 50 years after 
Lincoln's assassination, someone 
wrote a biography of his life and 
death . In this biography, the 
author fabricated anecdotes about 
President Lincoln and claimed 
that he was brutally stabbed to 
death. 

Because people who knew 
Lincoln and who witnessed his 
death would protest the contra-
dictions and invented stories, this 
particular book would not be 
accepted as true and factual. 
Similarly, the New Testament

Gospels were written within 30 
years of]esus' death and resurrec-
tion. If the "adventures" of Jesus 
were pure invention, the gospels 
would have never lasted long 
under scrutiny. 

In addition, some of the events 
in the Bible are mentioned in 
other books, such as the story of 
the Virgin Mary mentioned in the 
Koran. Although it is true that 
"science cannot verify the truth of 
the Bible," historical evidence and 

testimonies can. 
The greatest evidence for the 

existence of God is Jesus, who 
beyond a doubt was an actual his-
torical figure. Since the Gospels 
can be trusted, Jesus really did heal 
the sick, feed the 5,000, die on a 
cross and rise from the dead three 
days later. 

Christianity is based on Jesus' 
resurrection. ,If it weren't true, 
Christianity would have never 
spread after Jesus' death. 
Christianity is unique among a 
other religions in that Jesus is the 
only prophet with an empty tomb. 
Since Jesus' prediction that he 
would rise again after three days 
was true, it would seem logical to 
conclude that everything else that 
he claimed must also be true. His 
most important claim was that he is 
the Son of God. He claimed equal-
ity with God, "If you have seen me, 
you have seen the Father" Oohn 
14:9). 

According to the Bible, it is 
because of God's great love for us 
that he sent his Son to die on the 
cross to pay for our sins so that we 
might have eternal life in heaven 
(John 3:16). 

If we confess that Jesus is Lord 
and believe in our hearts that God 
has raised him from the dead, we 
will be saved from eternal separa-
tion from God (Romans 10:9). 
Therefore, the Christian belief is 
not a subjective faith in a fairy 
tale, but an objective faith in 
Jesus.

I would like to congrat~late the

UCSD reigned in it's raging party

every UCSD party and confiscate 
absolutely everything to insure it 
never happens again. 

In addition, all partygoers 
should be shot on sight. I mean, we 
have had almost five parties since

Also since the average La Jolla

Miranda: 
Mandatory reoding oj

lawyer (and that's probably a good 
thing), but for our justice system 
to work, we have to trust our 
institutions enough to believe that 
they bring people to understand 
the most basic principles of our 
law. 

If police want to continue to 
read the Miranda rights to those 
they arrest in some fonn (as many 
have said they will), I commend 
them for it. It does help to protect 
the rights of the accused. 

However, there is a big differ-
enCe between the police inform-
ing a suspect of his or her rights 
voluntarily and being required to 
do so by following a strict formu-
la, from which any slight devia-
tion is anathema.

CAMP ZEIST. Netherlands -
Nearly 12 years after a jumbo jet 
blew up in the skies of Scotland, 
raining bodies and flaming debris 
on the village of Lockerbie, the trial 
of two Libyans accused of planting 
a bomb on the plane got underway 
Wednesday. 

The trial is unusual in many 
ways: With 270 victims, it is the 
largest mass murder trial in British 
history, the first time a patch of 
Scottish soil has been created over-
seas to allow such an event, and the 
first Scottish murder trial to use 
judges instead of a jury. 

It is also the first time a trial in 
what is nominally Britain has 
attracted the massive attention 
usually associated with the 
American courts. 

"In many senses, this trial is 
unique," said John P. Grant, who 
leads a team of law professors from 
the University of Glasgow studying 
the trial and helping journalists 
with t~e vagaries of Scottish law. "It 
may become the longest trial in 
British history. It certainly will be 
the most expensive."

The trial culminates years of

She also tried to kill herself with

Potassium chloride was one of 
the three drugs the state used in

administered, her last words were. 
"I love you, my babies." 

At her 1998 trial, Riggs asked' 
jurors to sentence her to death, 
saying, "I want to be with my 
babies. I want you to give me the 
death penalty." 

Prosecutors said Riggs' chil-
dren had become an inconve-
nience. They said, for example, 
that she left them alone while she 
went to karaoke contests. 

Initially, Riggs pursued appeal 
of her death sentence. 

"We had to beg her to file an 
appeal of the conviction," said her 
lawyer, John Wesley Hall Jr. of 
Little Rock. 

She soon withdrew it. "She 
just wanted to get it over with," 
Hall said. 

Ri&JS had the right to stop her 
execution at any time by resuming 
the appeals process again, but she 
chose not to do so.

Fhimah is expected to last a year

In describ!ng the plot, the 
indictment accuses both defen-
dants of having been members of 
the Libyan Intelligence Services -
AI-Megrahi the head of security for 
Libyan Arab Airlines and Fhimah 
the airline's station manager in 
Malta - and of having acted in 
their intelligence roles. 

Before testimony began, the 
defense read a statement alerting 
the prosecution that it planned to 
blame the crime on a Syrian-
backed Palestinian group. 

Under Scottish law, the defense 
must state at the opening of a trial 
if it plans to mount certain defens-
es. They include insanity, se1f-
defense, coercion, "automatism" -
a notion akin to temporary insani-
ty - and "incrimination" - a 
claim that someone else did it and 
you will produce evidence against 
him. 

Lawyers for AI-Megrahi filed 
notice that they would offer an 
incrimination defense blaming 
members of the Palestinian Popular 
Struggle Front, possibly including

Metallica Tries to Prev.nt Downloading 
The surge in sharing and trad-

ing music over the Lnternet has 
brou$ht online music sites into 
conflict with record labels, which 
say copyrighted songs are being 
pirated. Wednesday the dispute is 
expected to take a si$nificant turn 
that will pit musicians directly 
against theIr fans. 

The heavy-metal band 
Metallica will seek to prevent 
335,000 fans from using Napster, a 
service for sharing music collec-
tions over the Internet. A lawyer for 
the band said the users, identified 
by their online handles, were mak-
ing Metallica recordings available 
for others to copy. 

Napster officials said Tuesday 
that under the law they would be 
obliged to bar anyone shown to 
have infringed copyright from 
using the service, though it was not 
clear what might prevent such 
users from reregistering. 

In any case, the move is a 
potential blow to the explosively 
popular but embattled Napster, 
which was created last year and 
already faces several lawsuits. The 
Metallica lawyer said that if the 
tactic succeeded, he would 
encourage similar moves by other 
musicians, thus potentially 
depriving Napster of thousands 

of users.

Jones, founder of KNAC.com. a 
Web site catering to heavy-metal

Metallica sees the issue very dif-
ferently, said its lawyer, Howard 
King. He said Metallica spent mil-
lions of dollars to create and mar-
ket an album and did not want to 
have the music traded freely 
online, depriving the band of the 
fruits of its investment. 

"The band would like to sell 
some albums," King said. 

He added that "it . is a lousy 
position to be in" for Metallica to 
be at odds with its fans. 

He said, however, that Napster 
has put Metallica in the position 
and forced the band to "take a 
stand." That stand entailed hiring 
a company to visit Napster to

dles of Napster users who say 
they have Metallica music to

Organizational Failure Blamed on Collapse 
Texas A&M bonfire collapse was caused in part by students, administrators 
BY RICHARD BRAY" 
BRADY CREEL 
The Battalion 

COLLEGE STATION, Texas 
- Organizational failures on the 
part of Texas A&M University 
administrators and bonfire stu-
dent leaders spanning generations 
contributed to - but did not 
directly cause - the 1999 Aggie 
Bonfire collapse, the Special 
Commission on the 1999 Aggie 
Bonfire found . 

Leo Linbeck Jr., chairperson of 
the commission, said the 
University administration's lack of 
control over the situation was one 
of the reasons bonfire collapsed. 

"The physical failure and 
causal factors lof the collapse) 
were in fact driven by an organiza-
tional failure," he said. "This fail-
ure - which has its roots in the 
decisions and actions by both stu-
dents and university officials over 
many, many years - created an 
environment in which a complex 
and dangerous structure was 
allowed to be built without ade-
quate physical or engineering 
controls." 

Linbeck said university 
administration and students failed 
to keep bonfire construction safe 
for a variety of reasons. 

"This organizational failure is 
complex, but includes such things 
as the absence of an appropriate 
written design or design process, a 
cultural bias toward predisposed 
courses of action and the lack of a 
proactive risk management 
approach," he said. 

Linbeck said a number of fac-
tors involving student actions 
were not a factor in the collapse. 

"Although there is evidence of 
drinking, horseplay and other 
irresponsible behaviors, none of 
them played a role in the col-
lapse," he said. "Also, there was no 
evidence that poor individual 
workmanship, excessive fatigue, 

poor compliance or sabotage 
played a role in the collapse: 

Veronica Callaghan, a member 
of the commission, said the inves-
tigation discovered numerous 
examples of irresponsibility on the 
part of student workers. Callaghan 
said the university did not hold 
students to the same expectations 
of professionalism that ot~er 
organizations do when workmg 
on a project the size of bonfire. 

"In the experience of the inves-
tigation team, Texas A&M is 
unique in allowing this level of 
irresponsibility in and around a 
construction project of this mag-
nitude. Clearly, there is the poten-
tial for these behaviors to affect 
worker performance, and thus 
perhaps structural integrity, which 
is why they are strictly prohibited 
at professionally managed con-
struction sites. 

"We found considerable evi-
dence of irresponsible behavior in 
bonfire," she said. "Alcohol use 
was substantial, although student 
leaders reportedly prohibited 
alcohol or obviously impaired 
workers from working on stack. 

"There was also evidence that 
hazing and harassment by student 
workers and student leaders, as 
well as unnecessary horseplay and 
fighting, are significant despite 
university efforts to control it," 
she said. "We have documented 
dozens of examples of these 
behaviors, some of which led 
directly to accidents in which stu-
dents have been hurt or hospital-
ized: 

Callaghan said although die 
1999 bonfire had an unsafe work-
ing environment, -that environ-
ment did not directly cause the 
collapse. 

"We did find clear evidence 
that worker safety processes are 
either inadequate or are not suffi-
ciently enforced," she said. "We 
also found that none of these safe-
ty problems could be directly 

linked to the collapse: 
Despite the findings of irre-

sponsible student behaviors, 
Callaghan said they were not a 
factor in the collapse. 

"We analyzed these behaviors 
closely, and searched for any evi-
dence that they might have con-
tributed materially to the col-
lapse," she said. "After careful 
review, we found no such evi-
dence: 

Callaghan said a number of 
suspected causes regarding stu-
dents did not actually contribute 
to the collapse. 

"No evidence was found that 
any single error by an individual 
led to the collapse," she said. 
"Additionally, we found no evi-
dence that supervision of these 
activities by student leaders was 
materially inadequate. We found 
no evidence that fatigue was a 
contributing factor despite the all-
night construction schedule: 

Callaghan said a lack of engi-
neering knowledge on the part of 
student leaders caused them to 
make structurally weakening 
changes to bonfires throushout 
the years - such as the deCIsions 
this year to use aggressive ·wedg-
ing" of stacks and not to use 
extensive cabling around the first 
stack. 

·We did find failure in the area 
of student skills and knowledge 
necessary for a project of this 
magnitude and complexity," she 
said. "Our investigation showed 
that the student leaders over many 
yt>-ars made design and construc-
tion decisions that adversely 
impacted structural integrity. 
EVIdence is also conclusive that 
student leaders lacked the proper 
knowledge to make better deci-
sions than they did given the 
complexity of recent bonfires: 

Callaghan said the lack of a 
blueprint for bonfire was an 
important factor in the structural 
weaknesses that led to the collapse.

In retrospect, Khullar said he

not all of the pertinent information 
has been released to the public yet. 

"No one knows everything right

should not speak at this year's all-

The A.S. Council voted 10-6-3 
to strike that clause from the reso-

Khullar said that the proposed 
resolution was unfair, as it did not 
accurately reflect student opinion.

"I would like to speak," Khullar 
said, "But, [what) 1 would like to do

clause pertaining to the com-
mencement.

Mantell said if he were a gradu-
ating senior, he would not attend 
this year's commencement. 

"I would be offended as a stu-
dent to hear from someone whom I 
no longer could trust," he said. 

The resolution also condemned 
the actions of the executives as a 
"violation of student trust" and 
demanded that a public apology be 
made to the student body.

Close ••• but No 'Spartacus' 
Hollywood's 'Gladiator jails short of epic status, but still offers action galore with clashing swords 
By DAVE YEN 
Senior Staff Woter 

"Gladiat r" is the kind of sweep-
ing, majestic epic that Hollywood 
just does not make anymore ". and 
in a way, the city seems to have for-
gonen how. 

Don't get me wrong. "GladIa-
tor" is a great film . In fact, it will 
likely be remembered as one of the 
year's best, earning Oscar nomina-
tions for best picture, costume 
design and without a doubt, art 
direction. 

If there is anything that stands 
out about the film, however, it is 
that director Ridley Scott and a 
-meticulous crew of set directors 
recreated ancient Rome from 
scratch. The centerpiece of the film 
IS the extraordinary Colosseum, 
faithfully reproduced through the 
aid of advanced computer graphics 
and intense labor. The scenery pro-
vides the backdrop for a captivating 
tale of a hero's journey - a tale of 
courage. revenge and ultimately, 
redemption. 

slavery, where he is trained to be a 
gladiator and fights for his survival 
instead of for Rome. Eventually, 
however, Maximus realizes that the 
only way to redeem himself is not 
through simple revenge, but by 
earning the respect of the people to 
become more popular than the 
Emperor himself. 

The first act of the film features 
too much development and not 
enough suspense. From the open-
ing battle scene, which is extraordi-
nary, the a udience is aware that 
Maximus will become an enemy of 
the Empire and be sold into slavery. 
This, however, does not manifest 
until an hour into the film and 
even then, the execution scenes are 
short-lived and lacking in rage and 
violence. Before the audience is 
given a chance to feel Maximus' 
frustrations and agony, he begins 
on the road to being a gladiator. 
Thus, it is almost as if one movie 
ends and another beginS 

While the film satisfies audi-
ences on a pure entertainment 
level, there are a myriad of plot and 
character flaws that separate "Glad-
iator" as a good film, but not quite 
a masterpiece. 

Russell Crowe ("LA Confiden-
tial", "The Insider)" plays Maximus, 
a victorious general who dreams of 
returning home to his family. The 
dying Emperor (Richard Harris), 
concerned that the fate of Rome 
will fall into the hands of corrupt 
politicians. decides to favor Max-
imus over his son Com modus 
Qoaquin Phoenix) to be anointed 
emperor. When Com modus learns 
of this decision, he kills his father 
and orders the execution of Max-
imus and his family. 

Once Maxlmus assumes the 
gladiator role. the film turns into a 
story of two characters: Maximus, 
the strong and honorable hero, and 
Commodus, the cowardly emperor 
who cannot command the respect 
of the people. Scenes are mcluded 
to make Com modus a more likable, 
or at least sympathetic character. 
These fail. for few can forget that 
Commodus was the one who 
ordered the death of Maximus' 
family. 

Courte~ of Dre_ortIs Pictures 
er..- Russel Crowe plays Marimus, a once grtat general who was later sold into slavery in Dreamworlt's 'GladUztor.' 

Maximus escapes death, but is 
unable to save his wife and son. 
Instead, he is viciously sold into 

Furthermore, Com modus' con-
tinued obsession with destroying 
Maximus coul)teracts any of his 
desires to be loved or to atone for 
failing his father. Some of the 
scenes between Maximus and 
Commodus here are almost comi-
cal. Moreover if this is supposed to 
be a battle between two worthy 
adversaries, somebody should have 
told Phoenix. 

There is little doubt about how 
the story will end, although there is 

an absurd plot twist at the end. A 
grand battle scene is expected but 
then discarded in favor of a pre-
dictable duel to the finish . 

As for the players. Crowe is 
magnificent as Maximus. He. is able 
to command the respect of every-
one around him not by killing or 
giving inspirational speeches (i.e. 
Mel Gibson in "Braveheart"), but 
through his quiet, honorable 
demeanor and fierce integrity.

list actor, as sought after as Tom 
Hanks. Phoenix is respectable in

and the late Walter Reed give solid 
supporting performances. 

"Gladiator" is a good film 
because it is not only about a hero's 
journey, but also about finding the 
honor and goodness within your-
self. Crowe's Maximus is able to 
make a transformation, realizing 
revenge is not as important as 
restoring Rome to its nobility. He 
also discovers that it is possible to 
fight for honor and one's country as 
a slave and as a gladiator. 

The problem with "Gladiator" is 
that it is not the type of movie that 
takes audiences on an emotional 
roller coaster, something that is 
expected with most historical epics. 
Maximus is rarely the underdog in 
the film , and by its denouement, it 
is obvious he is stronger of the two 
men. 

In short, do not see "Gladiator" 
expecting "Braveheart; but do 
expect a good film. Maybe it is not 
that Hollywood has forgotten how 
to make epics - maybe the rules 
have simply changed.

Preview: 
Farrelly brothers' new 
film will star Jim Carrey ContI._ fronI ...... 
John Leguizamo and Janeane 
Garafalo 

Plot: When Earth is almost 
annihilated by the Dregs, a not-so-
friendly group of aliens, a rebel-
lious teenager named Cale 
(Damon) embarks on a quest to 
save the human race. His only hope 
is the Titan, a legendary ship that 
supposedly holds the key to 
humanity'S salvation. 

Overview: Excellent cast of 
voices with a plot that could offer 
some very jaw-dropping visual 
effects, plus this is the guy who 
directed "All Dogs Go to Heaven." 
The animation is above par, but 
could definitely be better and the 
action is as intense as a Saturday 
morning cartoon. The producers 
are banking on that pre-teen mar-
ket to bring in the bucks and they 
probably will see success with the 
likes of Damon and Barrymore. 

Shaft 
Release Date: June 16 
Director: John Singleton 
Cast: Samuel L. Jackson. Christ-

ian Bale, Busta Rhymes, Jennifer 
Esposito and Vanessa Williams 

Plot: It is not the old Shaft from 
the 70s, but his nephew John Shaft 
Qackson) who is roaming the cor-
rupt streets of New York City. Sin-
~Ieton's rendition paints a world run 
by money and greed, where justice 
falls second to a well-placed bribe. 
The film revolves around a cat-and-
mouse chase between Shaft and 
Walter Wade (Bale), a spoiled rich 
kid who is running from the law 
with the hdp of a few corrupt cops. 

Ov!nicw: Singleton and jack-
son. The genius speaks for itself. 

ChickcnRun 
Rdease Date: June 23 
Director: Peter Lord and Nick 

Park 
Cast: (animated) Mel Gibson, 

Julia Sawalha and Miranda Richard-
son 

Plot: Rocky the Rooster (Gibson). 
and Ginger the Chicken (Sawalha) 
take on the perilous task of escaping 
their doomed fate at a chicken farm. 
They eventually become revolution-
aries, leading their fellow chickens in 
the great escape from the evil Mrs. 
Tweedy (Richardson), who is right 
on their tail. 

Overview: This movie is the 
Shawshank Redemption for poultry. 
The film is definitely intended for a 
younger audience, but tile intriguing 
plot and cast may be worth the 
money. Also, for those extremely dis-
turbed by "Animal Farm," here is the 
happy ending. 

Me, Myself and lrene 
Release Date: June 23 
Director: Bobby and Peter Far-

relly 
Cast: Jim Carrey, Renee Zell-

weger, Chris Cooper, Robert Forster 
and Richard Jenkins 

Plot: A Rhode Island cop (Car-
rey) escortS a woman (Zellweger) 
back to her hometown. Unfortu-
nately, Zellwcger is unaware that 
Carrey has a split personality and 
has also reluctantly fallen in love 
with her. Carrey fights his alter-ego 
so he can gain his fady's affections. 

Overview: "Liar Liarn proved 
that an audience can laugh for twO 
hours while watching a man beat 
himself to death. Expect the same, 
but with a very original Farrelly 
touch .

ContInued frOlll ...,. U 
Joely Richardson, Jason Isaacs and 
Trevor Morgan 

Plot: Touted as an Oscar-wor-
thy film, Benjamin Martin (Gibson) 
is a veteran of the American Revo-
lution and the French and Indian 
War. Martin, now attempting to 
raise a family of six in the American 
colonies, is reluctant to return to 
war against the British and does 
not lVant his children to see the 
carnage of war. Of course, one son 
(Ledger) does defy Martin and 
heads off to war, but subseq uently 
returns to hIS family. The film 
revolves around Gibson protecting 
both his son dnd family from accu-
sations of trcason. . 

Overview: Lots of drama with 
guaranteed action from the director

Cast: Ge rge Clooney, Mark

Plot: Adaptation of Sebastion 
Junger's 1991 "The Perfect Storm: 
The film recreates one of the most 
intense storms in recorded history, 
WIth lQO-foot waves and 120-mph 
winds as a six-man crew of a com-
mercial fishing boat unknowingly 
enters an uauc hell. 

Overview: This expensive cast is 
funded by an enormous budget but 
at least it assures lots of candy for the 
eyes. Clooney and Wahlberg work 
well together, as seen in "Three 
Kings: but Mastrantonio's bad 
kanna with sea movies su h as "The

commercIal Titanic.

Cast: Robert DeNiro, Jason

Plot: Boris (DeNiro) and 

Nat<lsha (Russo) escape their two-
dimensional cartoon world and 
enter reality by breaking a secret 
code. Not to worry, everybody'S 
favorite squirrel and moose are on 
the loose to find the dastardly pair. 

Overview: Never would anyone 
have imagined Scorsese's Raging 
Bull one day fighting an animated 
moose. To make matters more 
spooky, De Niro coproduced the 
movie. The wizards from Industrial 
Light and Magic should make the 
film a technical delight, and the 
world will once again see another 
SIde to the multifaceted DeNiro. 
This film will either prove DeNiro's

With songs like "I Hope You 
Die," "That Cough Came with a 
Prize," "A Lap Dance is so Much 
Better when the Stripper is Crying" 
and "The Ten C001estThings About 
New Jersey," it is difficult to take 
these guys seriously. 

Well, listeners are not supposed 
to take them seriously at cill and 
that is what makes them 90 great. 

Before judging the band, Jro to 
their Web site and join the ~­
hound Gang Hate Oub," or find 
their demos entitled "Just Another 
Demo" and "The Original Motion 
Picture Soundtrack To Hitler's 
Handicapped Helpers," which 
eventually led to 1994's Dinglebmy 
HJzu, 1995's Ust Your Fingm and 
1996's Ont Fierce 8m COIISIn'. The 
band became a cult favorite with 
these aIbtuns, and now they have 
come back with a vengeance with 
Hooray for Boobies ard they are com-

foul-mouthed, fifth-grade lyriCS. 
His singing blasts in rapid fire, 
backed by a wide variety of musical 
sounds. The Bloohound Gang 
sound is rounded out by LupUs 
Thiinder on the guitar, Evil Jared 
Haselhoff on the bass, Spanky G 
pounding on the drums and DJ Q-
Ball behind the turntables. 

Listeners will hear thick, driving 
punk guitars open the album, but 
they will also hear everything from 
an altemative grunge song to a 
catchy dance beat with drum loops 
and samples. The album seethes 
with heavy rock-rap beat mixes like 
those of Kid Rock or Kom, but 
these, in many ways, are better. 

"I Hope You Die" hits with a 
classic punk riff and kicks into a 
song that will automatically cause a 
fury of bodies to throw themselves 
into each other. Pop is full of angst, 
sneering "1 hope this helps to 
emphasize_ I hope this helps to clar-
ify. I hope you die!" 

Those who give this album a try 
will find themselves jumping up 
and down and waving their hands 
in the air like they just don't care to 

the sounds of "The Inevitable 
Return of the Great White Dope," 
with its bouncy hip-hop beat and 
quick lyrics about the life of Pop. 
He rants about his birth, death and 
the display of his brain in a "pickle 
jar at the Smithsonian." After ail, he 
is, "One part the Feuhrer, one part 
the Pope. The inevitable return of 
the Great White Dope." 

The clever rhymes and the taste-
less lyrics are constantly accompa-
nied by fantastic music. Songs like 
"The Ballad of Chasey Lain" (yes, 
the adult porn star Chaser Lain) 
and "Three Point One Four' proba-
bly will not get any radio play with-
out heavy editing, but blast them at 
home - they are hilarious. 

The Bloodhound Gang know 
they are pathetic, and they are com-
fortable admitting their sexual frus-
trations. Hooray for Boobies is vulgar, 
imrn<tture and crude, with testes-
terone-driven lyrics that are of 
almost no value at all. Listen to it 
with a grain of salt, do not take 
them seriously, and enjoy the stu-
pidity of the album as the Blood-
hound Gang calls out "now show 
'em them tits!"

spoke up,- Mcfarland said. "Jcn 
could always pid the team up with 
herencrgy: 

McLain had a team best 0.388 
hitting percentage and was sixth on 
the team in kills with 122 last sea-
son. She was also a kcy contributor 
to the Thtons' run to the 1997 
National Championship. 

After she $"aduates, Mclain 
plans on returmng to Africa, a con-
tinent she visited last summer. 
Once there, she plans on learning 
veterinary medicine, a field she 
hopes to build a career in. 

One of the problems with 
coaching college sports is that 
every four years. coaches have a 
t OO-pera:nt turnover in their ros-
ters. Mcfarland is obviously aware 
of this and he will certainly have a 
tough time replacing this trio of 
players. With 12 returners, 
Mcfarland will be primed to make 
another run at a National 
Championship, but replacing the 
talent of Mclain, Bender and 
HacItleman will be virtually impos-
sible. 

chance to win, and the only way to 
do this is through a sa1ary cap and 
collective bargaining. Football and 
basketball are more popular than 
baseball because every team in 
those leagues has a chance to win, 
or at least its fans think they do. Do 
you think the Expos' fans ~o out 
thinking their team is gomg to 
win? 

With it already a foregone con-
clusion who is going to win the 
pennant, excitement about the 
game wanes and reaches the state it 
is at now. where the only interest-
ing thing about it IS how many 
home runs Sosa and McGuire are 
going to hit. 

Baseball needs to kindle Ifte 
competitive fires that fuel spons by 
leveling the economic playing 
field . Yogi Berra once said, "playing 
baseball is 90 percent mental and 
half physical: The owners and 
players should use their mental 
abilities and do what needs to be 
done. 

Maggie Dwire, Jessica Shugart 
and Carolyn Jones are all going to 
be strutting their stuff for UCSD at 
the Division III nationals in a few 
weeks, as well. Shugart and Dwire 
both qualified with t t th-place 
times in their respective 400- and 
800-meter runs. 

Jones's 11 th place finish in the 
3000-meter run was also fast 
enough to send her to national 
competition. 

"It's the fastest she's ever run in 
her life: Salerno said of Shugart. 
"She's pleased: 

In addition to these individual 
highlights, the women's 4x400-
meter relay team also turned in a 
respectable 14th-place finish with a 
time that was fast enough to not 
only qualify for nationals but also 
to mark it as the third-fastest fin-
isher ever at UCSD in the 4 x 400. 

The strong showing from the 
Thtons at this meet is even more 
impressive considering that most 
of the other athletes came from 
Division I and II schools. Their 
impressive scores against this stiff 
competition casts an auspicious 
glow on the squad's upcoming 
showdowns. 

In the immediate future, sever-
al Thton athletes have been invit-
ed to comrte. in the Steve SCOII 
Invitation a , which will be held in 
Irvine on Sunday. UCSD will use 
this nonscoring meet as a tune-up 
for the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association 
Championships, which will be 
held in Davis, Calif. beginning 
May 12.

Greensboro made a valiant

This did not seem to matter to 
Donahue. 

"This tournament was a big 
boost for us," Donahue said. "Last 
year we finished second at nation-

stronger:

and unless some-

Men'. Tennis Single_ Star. 
Suff.r Early Exit at Ojai 
Triton team of Dan Albrecht and Mike Rosett also face 
roadblock in doubles, losing in first round to Pomona-Pitzer 
.,IIU. ..... 
Sports Editor 

The Ojai tournament is the premier 
event for tennis players of all ages and 
abilities. Last weekend, the top junior 
players in the country played alongside 
Pac-10 champions and Division III play-
ers vying for individual national champi-
onships. 

The lritons sent their current No. 1 
and No. 2 players, Dan Albrecht and 
Mike Rosen, to the tournament. 
The duo had a full day's work 
ahead for them. 

The pair competed in 
doubles and was also placed 
in the singles draw. 

Rosett shined in the first round, 
taking out Colorado College's top-rated 
Dave Creswell. 

Rosett lost the first set and was in danger 
of losing in straight sets when the second set 
went to a tie-brealter. 

Rosen showed his experience in tough 
matches when he took the tie-breaker and 
sent the match to a deciding third set. The 
third set was again closely contested, but 
Rosett won by one break of serve 6-4. 

"I think Mi~e played well in his first 
match," said Head Coach Eric Steidlmayer. 
"He kept getting better as the match went 
along." 

Deadly Santa Cruz was up next. 
In the second round, Rosen was 

matched with the tournament's No. 3 seed, 
Derrick Fitzpatrick from Santa Cruz. 

Despite the unlucky '!raw, Rosett stayed 
strong and refused 10 back down. 

Fitzpatriclt toolt the first set 6-2 in easy 
fashion . Rosen then bounced back to take 
the second set, just as he did in the first 
round. and had the momentum going into 
the third set. That momentum was quick-
ly done away with by Fitzpatrick when 
Rosen was broken in his first service 
game. 

Things just got worse from there and 
Rosett went on to lose the set 0-6, eliminat-
ing him from the tournament. 

In the first round, Albrecht had trouble 

early, losing 2-6 in the first set. He fought 
back in the second set but never saw the 
second round, taking the second set to a tie-
brealter before losing and being eliminated 
from the tournament. 

In doubles, Rosett and Albrecht have 
shown all season that they have the ability to 
compete with any team in the country. They 
had high expectations as they too~ the court 

against Pomona-Pitzer's No. 1 dou-
bles team. 

Expectations do not win tennis 
matches. however, and Albrecht 

and Rosett were made vel)' 
aware of this fact after their 
disappointing 1-6, 3-6 loss to 
their Pomona-Pitzer oppo-

nents. 
"I thought that we would win 

that doubles match," Steidlmayer said. 
·We certainly didn't play up to our capa-
bilities." 

With the Ojai tournament finished, the 
men's tennis team now turns its focus to 
bigger and better things with the Regional 
Championships on May 13 and 14. 

The team's goal all season has been to 
make it to the finals of the tournament, thus 
sending them to the National 
Championship in Kalamazoo, Mich. on May 
19 and 20. 

The Tritons will either be sent to play 
the University of Redlands or to take on 
UC Santa Cruz. Facing Santa Cruz would 
not be a positive experience. Everybody is 
hoping for a trip to Redlands because 
Santa Cruz is the top-ranked Division m 
team in the country. 

[t will also be crucial to have star 
Michael Meyer back in the lineup for 
regional competition . Meyer was the 
team's top-ranlted and most consistent 
player before going out with a stress frac-
ture. 

"We expect that Mike will be back,· 
Steidl mayer said. "We don't know what 
level he will be able to play at. but he 
should be able to play." 

Wish the Thtons luck as they attempt to 
become the first UCSD tennis team to malte 
nationals in the last seven years.

Women's Rowing Team Strokes Its 
Way to Three Victories at Miller Cup 
Lightweight four, novice eight and novice four divisions all 
garner first place at Balona Creek competition in LA 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD women's crew team Iteeps 
on improving with stroke after stroke. The 
squad had a highly successful Saturday 
this weekend at the Miller Cup in Los 
Angeles. 

The -regatta was hosted by Division I 
powerhouse UCLA and took place at 
Balona Creek, Calif. in the Marina del 
Reyarea. 

In addition to UCSD 
and UCLA, teams from 
the University of San 
Diego, UC Irvine, 
Orange Coast College, 
Chapman University, Long 
Beach State University, 
Occidental Colle$c, Loyola-
Marymount UniversIty and UC Santa 
Barbara competed in the women's-only 
regatta. 

After a series of heats, the TIitons com· 
peted in five final events, winning three. 

The UCSD victories came in the light-
weight four, the second novice eight and the 
novice four. 

A fourth·place ranking in the novice 
eight was garnered in the petit finals by the 
Thtons. UCSD also qualified for the petit 
varsity four finals with a good showing in 
the heat events. 

In the lightweight four petit final, UCSD 
placed second with a time of 11 :11.8, just 
behind Long Beach's winning time of 
10:44.9. 

"It was a reaUy strong race," Pinkerton 
said. "The tide was coming in, and the wind 
was blowing against them." 

UCSD's time of 9:54 flat gave it a victo-
ry in the lightweight four grand final and a 
lime of 9: 13 flat gave the Tritons a win in 
the novice four grand final, their third of 
the afternoon 

"The heat was a lot easier than the fina\," 
said Emily Gray, who was in the winning 
lightweight grand boat. "The tide was going 
out then. In the final , the tide was coming in 
and there was a strong headwind. It was 
basically a really long race." 

Another victol)' came in the novice eight 
petit final in a time of 9: 14.3 

"We ended up with a bad initial draw,· 
Pinlterton said. "We came in second in the 
heat and we improved our position." 

With the women's team being composed 
mostly of freshman and sophomores, youth 
is the theme of the season. 

UCSD's lightweight four team is com-
posed of Gray. Heather Beckman, Julie 

Snyder, Tia Shimada and Laurel 
Delapp. 

TIle nov ice four team is made 
of Katie Keenan, Nicole 
Matouk, Cari Blemker, 
Nicole Mead and Marie 
Tran. 

The second novice eight 
team features Jenn Green, Sara 

Patton, Rachel Weisser, Mollie Sullivan, 
Morgan Dawirs, Monique Thiesen, Rebekka 
Woodruff, Erina Suzuki and Liz Edmunson. 

The race saw difficulties because UCSD 
could not muster enough necessities to 
race. 

"We had to scratch because we didn't 
have enough equipment." Pinlterton 
explained. · We had to pick which crews to 
race. That was a bummer." 

The win was another step in UCSD's 
year of rebuilding and shows their vast 
improvement since day one. Gray sees the 
team coming along nicely despite lacking 
any big girls to take over the varsity reigns. 

"We have a huge novice team." she said. 
· We've been able to step up to the challenge. 
Our team is really close. This has been an 
exceptionally good year as far as people get-
ting along." 

Overall, Pinkerton was very pleased 
about the event. 

"tt was great results," Pinlterton said. "As 
a coach, you hope that it is a\l going to 
come together. I couldn't have been happi-
er." 

The women hope to continue their ever 
growing sltill and success in two weeks. 
Their next competition, along with the 
men, will be at the Pa cific Coast 
Championships on Sunday May 14 in 
Sacramento at 7 a.m.

Financial Refonn 
Needed in Baseball 

I have been a baseball fan since 
I was six and saw my first Giants 
gam~ My grandfather weaneq me 
on the exploits of players such as 
Willie Mays and Joltin joe. As it 
stands now in .my mind. baseball 
players are the biggest bunch of 
overpaid brats in the entire sports 
world. The game is in dire need of 
help, and right quick. 

The thing is, baseball players are 
aware of this, and they have been 
trying to change the game. There is 
the new interleague play, the new 
strike zone and realignment. 

However, they are going in the 
wrong direction . What baseball 
needs to do is recapture its roots. 
Baseball is inherently something 
American, accompanied by visions 
of sandlots, fresh Saturday morn-
ings, hot dogs, fathers and sons, 
and families. The changes 
wrought so far only try to mutate 
baseball into something more pro-
lific and exciting. when the real 
problem is something much dif-
ferent. 

Baseball is the only major spon 
without a salary cap or a collective 
bargaining agreement, and the 
average salary in baseball is over 
$1 .5 million. Salaries escalate and 
set new highs every year. With no 
cap and no collective bargaining 
agreement, it is impossible for all 
teams to compete. 

Year after year, the big-market 
teams such as the Yankees and 
Braves and Indians produce, and 
when teams such as the Marlins or 
Padres makes it to the World Series, 
it is only because they decide to 
spend $50 million-plus and then 
dump all their players. 

Teams that have large fan bases 
or make mucho bucks off mer-
chandising can afford to sign the 
big names - look at the Bronx 
Bombers, for example. They have 
Clemens, Williams, Jeter and "EI 

Duque.~ but I dare someone to 
name two players from the 
Milwaukee Brewers. 

The big market teams have the 
advantage of making colossal 
amounts of money off local TV 
contracts - the Yanks make close 
to $100 million. Collective bar-
gaining would make it so that 
every team is forced to put some 
of this merchandising and local 
TV money into a pot, which is 
then divided among all teams 
equally, giving each team a better 
chance of signing the players they 
need. 

However, the fault does not lie 
solely with biased distribution of 
money, but with the owners and 
their overpaying of the players, and 
in the players' antiquated notion of 
salaries. 

There have been two strike-
shortened seasons in the last 10 
years because the players would 
not agree to a salary cap. With their 
staunch assertion that players 
deserve to make whatever the mar-
ket will bear, the players themselves 
ruin the game. 

The players would be right if a 
league was a free market, but it is 
not. A league is a consortium of 
teams that thrive on competition, 
and competition is null and void if 
all teams cannot afford to sign

IJIILL ....... 
Sports Editor 

The graduating class of 2000 will include three 
seniors from the women's volleyball team. Allison 
Bender, jaime Hackleman and jennifer McLain 
will leave UCSD with many accolades and expec-
tations for the future. Perhaps most significant, 
they will leave with memories of the 1997 
National Championship. 

Bender was one of the team's top offensive 
threats last season and also a go-to player in 
crunch time. In addition to her ability, it is her 
positive outlook that Head Coach Duncan 
McFarland will remember most about her. 

"She had a great and constant smile on her 
face.· McFarland said. "That was something I 
remember all the way back to day one." 

Bender was McFarland's first recruit and an 
integral part of the team's success. She was sec-

ond on the team in kills last season with 237 and 
third on the team with 30 aces. 

"She was a great outside hitter for us: 
McFarland said. "She had a great jump serve and 
an equally good deep floater." 

Bender will also be remembered for her out-
standing performance in the 1997 quarterfinals 
against W.sconsin-Whit~ater. She led the team 
in kills that day and helped key the three-game 
victory. 

Bender is planning on taking the MCAT and 
going to medical school after graduation. . 

Despite her diminutive stature, Jaime 
Hackleman could really pack a punch from 
behind the endline. 

·She's pretty small for a volleyball player and 
was primarily a back-row specialist for us, but she 
was a real aggressive server and a great passer, ~

Golf Team 
Takes Kravetz 
Invitational 
Win comes down to 
tiebreaker against 
Greensboro College 
By TAn MIUlIl 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men 's golf team trav-
eled to the University of Rochester last 
weekend for the Fred B. Kravetz 
Invitational. 

At the end of the twO-day event, 
UCSD had defeated Greensboro 
College in a tiebreaker . 

UCSD, ranked fifth in Division III 
golf, was two strokes behind second-
ranked Greensboro after one day at 
Irondequiot golf course. Day totals 
are tabulated by taking the lowest 
four scores from each team and 
adding them together. Greensboro's 
four-man total was 303, and UCSD 
recorded a 305. 

Darren Sullivan of UCSD posted 
the lowest score of the day - he was 
the only player in the tournament on 
either day to come iR under par with 
68. 

Seven teams and 36 panlclpants 
competed in the tournament. All 
seven teams are ranked in the top 25 
in the nation by the Golf Coaches 
Association of America. 

Also playing in the event were 
15th-ranked Ohio Wesleyan, 
fourth-ranked Skidmore, 16th-
ranked Allegheny Gators, 19th-
ranked Williams and 22nd-ranked 
University of Rochester. Rochester, 
because it was hosting the event, got 
an extra individual entry. 

On the second day, the tournament 
moved from Irondequiot, NY. to 
Oakhill. Oakhill has hosted three U.S. 
Opens and is one of the toughest 
courses in the nation. 

The scores for the second day 
reflected this. Not a single player shot 
at par or under. 

In an exciting round of golf, UCSD 
and Greensboro battled back and 
forth. Sullivan and james Donahue led 
the charge for UCSD. Donahue post-
ed a two-day total of 149, a 75 and a 
74, good enough for first in the indi-
vidual standings. 

Sullivan, after being the first day's 
leader, had some problems on the 
second day. He got to the clubhouse 
with a nine over 81, but his two-day 
total of 151 was still good enough for 
second place in the individual stand-
ings. 

Rounding out the top four for 
UCSD were David Hansen with a 158 
and Andy Thompson with a 160. 

The Greensboro players finished 
much closer to each other than did 
the UCSD players. All four 
Greensboro members were between 
152 and 156. Finishing one and two 
for Greensboro were Derek Cobb 
with a 152 and Kevin O'Connel with 
a 155, good enough for third and 
fifth respectively. 

In such a tournament, where it is 
the collective scores that count, a 

, team such as Greensboro would usu-
ally win. Coaches want to see a large 
group of players finishing with solid 
scores, not just one or two, as with 
UCSD. With four players in the top 
eight, Greensboro did exactly that. 

In this tournament, however, 
UCSD's top two scorers were just too 
tough, finishing with a seven-stroke 
advantage over the top two 
Greensboro competitors. 

The opposition could not over-
come.
