Sexual harassment in academia 
By CANOLE 

"Why can't he keep his 
hands off me? I don't care if h 
"ays he likes his favonte 
female st udents. 

"I've told hIm before that It 
bothers me. I can't study 
under thesc conditions. When 
I came hcre I thought I was 
exp ted tou:;emymind to get 
grades. not my body." 

Christine (not her real 
name) is a UCSD student. She 
Is also a vIctim of sexual 
harassment. Onc of her 
profcssor'i ha~ persistently 
made advances towards her, 
putting her in an emotional 
academIc maelstrom. 

he wants to know how to 
stop the hara ment without 
threatening her academic 
career, and how to get the 
word out, to stop future 
haras , ment of female 
tudents. 
There i a growing need to 

educate and sen itize the 
campus community so that 
faculty and T.A.s will realize 
that , though their approach 
mIght be well intentioned, any 
ty pe of advance will put their 
tudent in a compromising 

positIon. 
Early in the academic year, 

Chancellor Atkinson relea. ed 
a lengthy letter addressed to 
g-raduate students. faculty and 

taff in which ::I <;mall in 'crt 
, tated that the admtnlstration 
has im oked a t mporary 
policy regarding sexual 
harassment.It wa. also noted 
that a COpy of this statement 
was on file. 

The poltcy was drawn up by 
Assistant Chancellor Dr.Joyce 
Justus. who came to UC 'D in 
July of 1981 express I, for the 
development of such a lXlltq . 

"I rCSD IS required by law to 
take actIOn to prevent such 
behaVIOr." Ju~tus saId in a 
recent Interview, "The 
unt\'ersltv IS liable in the"e 
cascs. sci it IS not a purely 
henen)lent act. We are sImply 
comply 109 WIth the law." 

In addition to the policy 
Ilutlme, Justus has 'it'l up a

A bulletin board 
CODltnentary 
Is it more than just variegated garbage stapled to 

t he wall? As we walk t he campus \\'e are forced at 
e\'ery turn to look at a multi-colored mass of leaflets at 

e\'er~ turn. on every post. e\ery door. every \vall. and 
the newest, most ingemous place - the sidewalk. 

Most recently the pamphleteers ha\' been 
quite imaginative. Why. just two weeks ago the 
student body was notified of an upcoming" horts 
and hades" party by a series of green sheets. a good 
dozen, masking-taped to t he sidewalk in an attractIve. 
eye-catching geometric pattern. Very good guys. We 
honor you \',ith the coveted "Cle\'ere"t Propaganda 
Display Award." This award IS co-sponored b~ the 
Local Printers Association and the Leagueof ~1a~king 
Tape Makers of America. 

Did you ever :.top to consider how much mone,' 
printers and graphic drsignl'r:-- are making from our 
campus leaflet folly? :\1asking tape. thumbtack and 
staple companies must lo\'e u<.;. Why. on a single pillar 
alone one can find an entire case of used staple~; in 
various stages of decay and rust. These staple:'> are 
destmed to remain for eternIty - unless of course the 
university creates an new position entitled Provost of 
Campus taple Removal and include!-l a heft\' salarv. 

Are the!-le printed heets which are constantiv 
littered before our eye ' telling us things that \\'e rea II}' 
\\-'ant to know? Is this information relevant to our life 
as students? Is it necessarv to our bodilv 
tunctlOns (namely eye.'IghW 1)0' we really need til 
vie\\ it everv day £'l'('rv where? 

For an exampf~.lct us con"icler all the thousandsof 
fans of Judy Gorman-jacobs. the Feminist Blues /Jazz 
musician. (We' ve all Iward of her haven't \\ e Or at 
least seen her name on even' other corner I If the fact 
that she was to play "under 't he stah at the l he Cafe" 
\\a..,n·t so blatently displayed all 0\ er campu"i. it i..,n·t 
jx)sstble that all of her fans could know of the big 
e\·ent. It would be ghastly if such ncv·:s had to be 

~pread by word of mouth or looked up in such obscure 
places as the Arts "iection of a newspaper. 

And what atx)ut all those job seekers out there? 
Shouldn't the\' be reminded that the\' can earn $:360 a 
week? And. s-hould they forget. be -rellllndC'd agam. 
three ·teps later? Tn this case, job hunters are treated 
better than old]udy's fans - the brochure attracting 
them is a brtght. cheerful. eye catching orange. It IS 
al<.;o the epItome of COn\'cmence acl\ertising. E\er~ 
sheet is complete \\ tth ten (rount 'em) tear-off phone 
numbers . :Vlarvelou.., for t he job hungry ' tudent who 
doesn't carry a pen. They even flutter In the breeze. 

There is anot her commendat ion for our 111fillt rat ion 
of wall information - but before that. \\'(' ha\'eCl few 
!>uggest irms and a few pet peeve". 

FIrst of all. there shold be a pro\'islon in I he {'C

What \Vas the Dlotive of the Tylenol Killer? 
BY ROGER SIMON 

1.0, Anl/elc, Till1e~ S} ndkall' 
It wou ld make us feel better 

if we knew the reason behind 
it. It would make us fe I better 
if we knew there was a reason 
behind it. 

::'even people are randomly 
kill d with cyanide-tainted 
Tylenol and no one knows 
why. And that is the scartiest 
thing of all. . 

I watched a national TV 
reporter say with some hock 
that "as of yet" no group had 
taken credit for and no 
d mands had been made in the 
murders. 

who they are both in their 
per~onal and professional 
lives." 

Does that narrow it down a 
lot for you? 

A per'ion I know who has a 
background in finance has 
tned to make his own sense 
out of th killings. He believes 
the motive for the crime was 
profit and he described a 
cheme whereby a person 

cou ld have made money off the 
fall of Johnson & John 'on 
stock. Johnson & Johnson 
makes Tylenol. 

I won't pass the scheme on. 
But Johnson & Johnson tock 
has dropped more than $5 per 
share 'Ii nee t he story broke.

There are also vacat lOners,

have been in foreign countries 
where. t he story wa" not 
covered or at least not covered 
in English. who may come

Had someone ca lled up a 
newspaper and identified 
himself as the leader of th 
Inasan Red Parasite Brigade 
and demanded the release of 
all political prisoners from 
some banana repu blic, that 
would mak s some sense to us. 

It would be simple 
terrorism. something we no\\ 
understand as being part of 
our daily lives. 

And I suppose 'omebody 
could have dreamt up ' uch a 
scheme. but I doubt It. 
Financial criminal rarely kill 
to pull off their crimes. 

We have been reminded 
endlessly t hat we live in an age 
of mass communication, but 
letting everyone in the 
Chlcago.area know that they

continued from page 2 

Another thing is maintenance. If you've go to be 
clever and eye catching and geometric and what not 
and use the idewalk, check the locale every once i~ 
a while. Paper ~ets torn by the many trampling feet 
that tend to rum the neatly planned effect. Al 0, it' 
terribly annoying to be an innocent pede trian and get 
mas king tape joyous ly stuck to the bottom of your 
Birkenstocks. Have some respect and keep the tape to 
a minimum. It is a high maintenance product. 

The commendation, yes , we didn' t forget. 
It i purpose. These scattered remanants provide a 

purpose for hundreds of people. Just think of the 
person who travels across the campu from board to 
wall to door, staple gun in hand. Thi person is 
ob~'iou Iy in motion with some intent, some goal. Or, 
thmk of the person who thought of the information 
that is put on t he sheet - the pu bl icity chairman for 
the Club, Organization or Special Intere t Group. 
They are thinking, gathering information , then 
setting about the task of organizing - what word 
should be the biggest and should we use a picture? 

Look again at that littered post. Thi~k ~f a 1'1 the 
ingredients that have turned it into what it is. It is art. 
It i relevant. It is a part of campu life.

Blood kisses the pavement 
flesh is lett behind: 
We change lanes 
To avoid the flares 
Red socks strangely bright 
He lies there 
Lifeless lungs 
Breathing blood mixed with rainwater 
The rain falls pitilessly; 
His body lies, lonely. 
Unable to return 
The stares 
A black sportscar crashed off the road, 
Three trucks. 
Two men stand down the road, with flashlights, smoking; 
Blood red flares bum through the haze. 
Unattended street·kisser, still in the middle; 
Death and rain too heavy to drag aside, 
The vision blurs as distance flies, 
Depression fades as someone cries.

"Drawings by Painters" at UCSD 

By RONA HrJ 
Most stUdents are completely 

ullaware of an art gallery here on 
campus that showcases paint-
ings. sculptures and installa-
tions by major artists. UCSD's 
own Mandeville Art Gallery. 
located in the Mandeville com· 
plex near the Student Center. is 
such a place. 

Past exhibits have included 
works by artists as widely 
known as Picasso and Chagall. 
as well as new artists whose rep-
utations have not yet reached 
the general public. Art director 
Geny McAllister explains that 
the gallery's purpose is to pro-
voke thought : "We don't want 
people to just come in here and 
sayOh. that's pretty: The image 
shou ld remain with them .. 

The current exhibit. Draw-
ings by Painters, is indeed a 
thought-provoking one. A col-
lection of 52 drawings by 52 
California artists. the show was 
organized by Richard Arm-
strong for the Long Be.lch 
Museum of Art. to 'redefine 
drawing in a contemporary con-
text as a spontaneous activity; 
an inherent part of the act of 
painting," The artists repres· 
ented are well·known in the art 
world. and anyone not familiar 
with any of these artists might 
want to stop by the "1andevil le

Drawings" is a general 
tern) While all of tht~l' works 
are on paper. few of them con· 
form to the general notion of 
drawing as equated with sketch-
ing. Some drawings appear to be 
half-fin ished . while others 
would ordinarily be considered 
paintings. Varying degrees of 
spontaneity are evident. from 
Joe Goode's buckshot punc· 
tured layers of colored paper. to 
Dan Douke's photographically 
realistic watercolors. Mediums 
range from the conventional ink 
and graphite to oil. acrylic. 
gouache or crayon. There is even 
a piece. "Aesthete" by Charles 
Hill. composed of ragged. torn 
brown paper layered and 
stitched together. 

A wide range of styles and 
methods are represe nted . 
"Uncle Sam Taunts" by William 
Wiley is a crayon dnd paint com· 
position that resembles graffiti 
through which a barely recog-
nizable face can be seen. The 
border reads " you can bleed 'em

Nor is Ruscha the only artist 
with a sense of humor. Richard 
Jackson's drawing. "Big Idea : 
1000 Pictures Stacked", shows a 
pile of anonymous framed 
paintings from a bizarre, tilted 
angle complete with perspec-
tive lines. The piece is done 
mostly in pencil. with dabs of 
color around the edges of the 
stack as if the spirit of the paint· 
ings were somehow trying to 
escape the heap. 

Another amusing work is

Peter Gabriel 
Peter Gabriel 
Geffen Records 

By II PI KASSOUNI 
When Peter Gabriel left Gene· 

sis in 1975. many rock 
observers saw it as an act of 
surrender - that art rock. the 
genre he helped define. had lost 
its classical base under a veil of 
pretension and epic bombast. 
Others, however. felt that he 
simply needed to abandon his 
typecast in order to devote 
more time to the as of yet 
untapp d potential of rock - a 
pursuit that could not be 
I imited by the restraints and 
sacrifices of collective effort. 
Though the controversy 
remains. Gabriel has more than 
justified the move through his 
adventurous, often eclectic solo 
work. 

The first two albums, released 
in 1977 and 1978. saw Gabriel 
depart from the textured. shift-
ing opuses that had become 
Genesis' trademark. in order to 
establish a more conventional 
approach. Though Gabriel 's 
work during this period tread no

Hy MARK HElMER 
The post punk era in England 

has spawned a host of groups 
with visible roots from this 
period, one of the better of 
which is the Psychedelic Furs. 
Their 1980 debut was marred by 
poor production and lack of 
consistent material. But on last 
yera's Talk Talk Talk. the Furs 
combined powerfully honed 
guitar with shadowy, rustic 
vocals to come up with one of 
the best records of 1981. 
Unfortunately, their newest 
effort. produced by Todd 
Rundgren, is a poor follow up. 

ChOo')sing Todd Rundgren to 
produce this album is a curiou'i 
choice to say the least. 

Lindley will 
return here 

Guitarist David Lindley and 
his group EI Rayo-x. whose con-
cert last week at Humphreys was 
stopped by the Harbor Police, 
agreed to come back and play at 
the Rodeo. The ~how is \et for 
October 21. Per ons with ticket

Rundgren, one of the mo t 
versatile memb rs of the rock 
community, specializes in 
flowing pop melodies which are 
constructed just a notch too 
progressively to gain mass 
appeal. The furs just don't seem 
to be compatible with this sort 
of scheme. Power is what made 
Talk Talk Talk such a fine record, 
and for some reason the band 
decided to give up most of that 
in favor of Rundgren's softer. 
distant touch. 

The lack of intensity cannot 
be attributed solely to 
Rundgren. Defections have also 
hurt the band. Guitarist Roger 
Morris has departed, leaving 
John Aston to handle things on 
his own. Saxon ist/ Keyboard ist 
Duncan Kilburn has also left. 
These three together provided a 
full and extremely intense 
framework for vocalist Richard 
Butler. 

The album's good cuts are few 
and far between. "Only You and 
I" is one of the few songs with a 
rough edge and a pounding beat 
supplied superbly by bassi~t 
Tim Butler and drummer Vince 
Ely. Rundgren 's sax and 
keyboards help make "No Easy 
Street' interesting, and Rll hard

Josie Cotton 
Elektra 

By I'1IKt:L T00I'168 
Josie Cotton's debut album 

covers some of the same ground 
- '60s-style girl-pop - already 
explored by fellow Angelinas 
the Go-Go's. Now, there 's 
certainly nothing inherently 
wrong with that, but the world 
deserves better than Convert-
ible Music 

This album contains a 
number of highly likable, highly 
derivative tunes - some 
written by Cotton herself -
which are played with the 
utmost competence, The 
problem is that Cotton's 
singing, although pleasant. is 
extremely bland. Her lack of 
definition merely serves to dull 
the impact of many ofthe songs. 
but in one instance - Johnny 
Are You Queer: written by 
producers Bobby and larson 
Paine - an already suspect 
treatment of a controversial 
topic becomes .'>omewhat 
offensive. The Go-Go's once 
pulled this .')ong off in their live 
d . most likely because you 

could .'iense that 50me of their 
best friends were gay. but J~ for

following the leader over the 
edge in tbe cult's playground 

By CANOIL 
Consider epi-phenomenon as 

the psychological effect pro-
duced when a group of people 
gather together for a single pur-
pose. If you equate an epi-
phenomenon with a rei igious 
group. you will have the theme 
of the movie Split-Image. 
Before looking at Split-Image, 
let's clarify what "epi" is. 

In our modern, highly popu-
la~ed society. many of our expe-
riences involve being in large 
crowds of people we mayor may 
not know. When the crowd is 
gathered with a single intent 
they can produce a contagious 
high. Examples of this are 
Charger football games, movies 
like Rocky and f .T" political 
rallies, religious congregations 
or even tragic situations such as 
the mourning of the deaths of 
John and Bobby Kennedy. In our 
normal lifespan you will proNt-
bly experience hundreds of epi. 
so it is well worth your efforts to 
understand how epi affects you, 

During the opening credits of 
the movie Split-Image we are 
introduced to Danny, the self 
driving gymnast who keeps 
pushing himself beyond the 
pain of blood-torn hands to per-
fect a new dismount. only to fail 
over and over. not even coming 
close to completing the feat. 
Then the movie springs forward 
to the competition and in the 
fervor of the hometown crowd 
encouragement. Danny per-
forms his dismount perfectly, 
his first epi, the thrill of sports. 

We are next exposed to Dan-
ny's family life, the great Ameri-
can dream, a designer label 
home of the best money can 
buy, all Quantity with I itt Ie 
r gard for Quality. prcsrnted to 
us in (I humorousl} likeable

<,(lap operas: TV epi. 

world. And we want to know 
more about this loving and 
smiling young woman and how 
he came to be this way. 

Their first date is at a screen-
ing of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, 
movie epi. Here is where we 
receive our first manipulation of 
epi. The movie of Jekyll does 
deal with the idea of good and 
evil within us, and it is used as 
not just a presentation of that 
idea, but rather as a lure to get 
us to come visit Homeland, a 
place where people are con-
cerned about good and evil in 
our world. 

A few of us decide to attend 
the three day retreat into Home-
land, and the moment we step 
off the bus, we are greeted by a 
mass of loving people. epi 01 
group acceptance of a stranger. 
Then our first meal. Kool-aid 
and brownies. sugar bombing, a 
physical mechanism for excit-
ing our spirit and lowering psy-
chological resistance. During 
the opening stages of our life at 
Homeland. we are gently 
stroked with the power we can 
feel by allowing ourselves to 
become absorbed into the 
group, This is one ofthe strong-
est features of epi. But then we 
start to get the indoctrination 
that Homelnd could not have 
been if not for Neal. its founder. 

The second halt ot Split-

Image deals with the de pro-
gramming of Joshua a.k.a. 
Danny. The director cleverly 
gives us Pratt the depro-
grammer as a moustached vcr-
sion of Neal. If one listens 
closely, one hears a good expose 
on how epi is used to manipu-
late people. What Pratt presents 
is reality therapy. but like Neal. 
he is totally one-sided in his 
approach. And like Neal he uses 
repetition and isolation of our 
emotions as technique to con-
vert us to his dogma, 

Overall. Splil-lmage implies 
that we need a balance of epi 
experiences and a reality aware-
ness so that our own personal 
image does not become split. 
The more subtle .portrayal of 
this comes through the charac-
ter of Rebecca who makes the 
changes Danny does without thc 
hype used to make the mOl( ie 
story of Danny mteresting. 

In conclusion, perhaps tht 
strongest and most subtle 
scenes involve the constant vis-
ual return to the windmills in 
the night. These are not just 
backgrounds, for no story 
action occurs with the wind-
mills. They are constant remind-
ers that we can be our own 
windmill generators that 
receive the energy of the com-
munity winds to keep us going 
in a dark world.

Along with her dance career, 
Dabrowski . the recipient of a 
UCSD Alumni Scholarhsip for 
academic excellence. is 
carrying a full load of classes. In 
describing the difficulty she has 
juggling two careers, she 
explains, 'It's hard, but I'm used 
to it by now. I don't think about 
the amount of work I have to do. 
. . I just do it and everything 
works out." The dancer adds 
with a smile. ' I don't get a lot of 
sleep though. ' 

All of her hard work and 
per~evcrance have paid off, She 
gets great joy out of performing. 
"The actual performance i., the 
reason I like to dance. It'.s a 
natural high. Ht'hearsdls and

But the fcc I ing you gft from th

In the tuture, she hopes to

"Being a dancer is a very short·

education is equally important. 
"School is not just something to

Guardian 
Sports Line 

By MIKE GREENBERG 
Staff Wriler 

One of the worst and most work on the re t of their game 
boring spectator sports is earlier. 
tennis. Sure. a John Another ugge tion would 
McEn.roe-Jimmy . ~onners be that player get one 
duet IS rather exCltlOg. but opportunity to complain about 
what about a Rodney Harper- a call and would be 
Raul Ramirez five- et di qualified for a second 
marathon? Here are ome complaint. That would force 
uggestions to make tennis a the McEnroe·Na ta e element 

better sport to watch. to hut up. 

Players should be allowed 
only one serve. There is 
nothing more boring than 
watching a player with a big 
erve boom in one serve after 

another against a player who 
can return on:y weakly. if at 
all. [f the players 10 t points 
with only one fault. they 
would be sure to take a little off 
the serve. and the ball would 
be in play much more. After 
all. the beauty of tenni i 
having the balI in play. not 
having one player continually 
ace another. 

Eventually. such a change 
would even help the big 
servers. Commg up through 
the lower level of enior 
tournament play. they 
overwhelm so many oppon· 
ent .. with their big serve that 
they get little practice on the 
other parts of their game , 0 
they're overmatched against 
more versatile players at the 
top level (a case in point. 
Roscoe Tanner vs. John 
McEnroe). This change wou ld 
force them (the big servers) to 

Players should only get 15 
econds to serve after getting 

the ball. That would eliminate 
all the silliness of ball 
bouncing and performing the 
little manneri m which only 
serve to delay the game. 

Finally, spectators should 
boo in unison everyt ime a 
referree announces. "Pleasedo -
not take your seats until the 
game is over." At football. 
baseball, and basketball 
games, spectators move ~nd 
talk while the game IS bemg 
played. and conce sionaires 
are yelling constantly. There' 
no reason that tennis matche 
have to be funeral quiet. If the 
player think they can't 
survive in a noi "y atmo phere. 
£'11 invite them to a UC D 
Koala football game. Now 
those things are noisy , and the 
players concen t rate never· 
thele s. 

If thee rule were 
implemented, the quality of 
tournament play would 
improve. and with fiercer 
competition, tennis would be a 
better sport to view.

When asked If eleven hours a week is sufficient time for a coac h 
to produce a com pet itive team (incredibly, coaches are only paid 
for eleven hours a week), Wat son replied" I have absolutel} no 
Idea." Presented wit h the fact I hat a coach must devote time for

say goodbye to them as well as t he program itself. As the old 
saying goes , "have bills will travel." (A preview of comlOg 
nttraction ) 

Training intense for rowers 
NOT TO BE BELIEVED DEPT, Talk about power. The 
teleVIs ion networks along with millions of people are being hurt 

b~' two egos. Jack Donovan, chid negot lator for the 0\\ ners , and 
:-JFL Players Director Ed Garvey are t he maIO cogs holding up a 
..,trlke settlement. rn essence. they control our Sunday and 
Monday nigh ts. r t' s no wonder that t he..,e t wo fellow., get paid by 
the day , in. tead of on the basis of a qUick settlement. We're In 
our 24th day, the strike continutes, and these two jokers ares/ill 
gett ing paid. 
WAIT A MINUTE DEPT, Every sport shou ld have parity. 
and most do. Of the four major sports, foot ball. baseball. and 
hockey have achieved a balance. The one except IOn is basketball. 
While five teams are successful year in and year out, the ather 18 
engage in a wild melee to reach the playoffs. Only Boston, 
Philadelphia. Los Angeles. Milw aukee, and San Antonio have 
Ix)oked reservat ions in t he playoffs for the next ten years. Why I~ 
t his? b it becaus of t he free agenq ~ystem eXist ing 10 the ~BA? 
Could it lx' that some owners are willing to spend me~abuck s for 
quality players. while ot her.., are busy CIluntlOg t heir penOle~? b 
It because there are onl\' fl\'e good coaches around? Ar e the 
(lI\1sion s a ligned lOappropriately? ff \'uu an..,wrred yes to nny of

I here are only fi\'e shre\\d general manager.., who know \\ hat 
they a re dOlOg. They make the right trades, drafl the right 
pin\'ers, and hire ('oaehe" that complement theil particular 
team's style 0 1 play. 
THEY A KED FOR IT DEPT. TexasA&1\l got tired of losing 
<,\'er) year to the lIm\ ersity of Texas, so they decided to do 
something about It. They lured Jackie Sherill away from 
Pillsburgh with a multi·mlliion dollar contract that rnake~ 
Sherill the highest paid coach in the country .. 0 far hi~ 
LOntributions have been minimal to sa~ the least. After a month 
of Aggie foot ball, the wolves are howling. The team has amassed 
,I tot al of one win. and the "send 'herdl back to Pittsburgh" fan 
rlub IS becoming the ne\\ social force of Texas A&:vJ loyalists.

feel s hopeful that hi s 
returning veteran core of 
heavyweight and lightweight 
oars men will act as a catalyst 
for a well·balanced men' · 
squad thi ' year . Both coaches 
are optimist ic about the 
challenges which their crews 
will face in tht' upcoming 
spring eason. 

In a university noted more 
for academic excellence than 
athletic pro we s, the UC 0 
rowing team has firml y 
e tablished and continues to 
maintain a reputation as oneof 
UCSD's most succe s ful 
intercollegiat e teams . Thi s 
success can be measured not 
only by the material rewards 
of victory but perhaps more 
importantly by the numbers 
and infectious enthusiasm of 
t he parti cipants.

This is no 
bargain for 
UC employees. 

Until now, UC 
employees have been 
forced to accept what-
ever pay and working 
conditions have been 
doled out to them by 
t he Regents, the Legisla-
t ure and t he Governor. 

UC employees now 
have t he right to choose 
a union that will negot i-
ate a cont ract through a 
process called collective 
bargaining. 

This right was brought 
one big step closer to 
reality last week when 
the Public Employment 
Relations Board esta-
blished bargaining units 
coveri ng most of UC's 
staff employees. 

T he UC 0 Guardian 

AFSCME/UC 
demands speedy 
elections. 
AFSCME gua ra nteed 

elections for more than 
45,000 UC workers when 
it immediately filed peti-
t ions with the signatures 
of tens of thousands of 
UC employees asking for 
the chance to choose 
AFSCME in a representa-
tion election. 

AFSCME has demand-
ed that the UC elections 
be held as soon as pos-
sible so that UC employees 
will be able to win better 
pay and improved job 
security at the bargain-
ing table. 

AFSCME is strong 
on bargaining 
experience. 
Our skill ed negotiators 

have won dramat ic gains 
for public employees 
throughout California. 
They include substantial 
pay increases, cost-of-
living increases, increased 
job security, better ca reer 
opportunities, improved 
health, safety and other 
working conditions, and 
pay for out-of-class work. 

Now AFSCME/UCs 
---------, negotiators are prepared 

s 
· D.1VI~ 

to win similar advances for 
UC employees. 

Thur-;day, October l ·t, 19M2. 

AFSCME/UC'S 
economists will 
strengthen your 
hand in cont ract 
talks. 
To back up our 

demands at the bargain-
ing table, AFSCME/ UC's 
economists are already 
on the job preparing a 
complete report on the 
impact of recent and 
future state budget cuts 
on employees through-
out t he UC system. 

UC employees can 
have an even stronger 
voice at the bargaining 
ta ble - with a vote for 
AFSCME, one strong 
union of UC employees. 

This is the new 
way to bargai 
for better pay 
and b fits.
