UCSD Nurses,:UC Administration 
Negotiate for Better Wages, Benefits 
By CYNTHIA CHESY 
Staff Writer 

The UC administration's final 
offer in direct negotiations to in-
crease the pay and benefits of 
UCSD Medical Center nurses was 
rejected late last week by the UC 
registered nurses' union, the Cali-
fornia Nurses Association (CNA). 

The offer included a 4.5 percent 
wage increase up only 1.5 percent 
from the administration's original 
offer and two additional holidays 
paid at time-and-a-half. 

Also included in the offer was 
an additional job classification 
step which would allow nurses to 
advance one level and receive a 
pay increase of approximately five 
percent without first having to 
apply for a promotion. 

The negotiating team, consist-
ing of approximately 10 people 
on each side have been meeting 
since early October but have not 
reached an agreement on a new 
two-vear contract. 

1,000 full-time and on-call nurses 
employed by the UCSD Medical 
Center, initially asked for a 20 
percent raise, but lowered their 
request to 15 percent. 

The administration first offered 
the UCSD nurses a three percent 
raise, but by the end of the nego-
tiations, they increased their offer 
to 4.5 percent. 

UCLA and UC San Francisco 
nurses, on the other hand, were 
offered a 10 percent wage increase 
in their next contract. 

Administrators say this differ-
ential is due to market rates based 
upon salary survey information 
in the specific area of the state and 
also the amount of union activity 
in each area. 

"UC has always tried to com-
pare the market rates and come 
up with a figure according to the 
conditions in each area," Sonia 
Healey, the associate director of 
hospital and clinics and director 
of patient care services at UCSD, 
said, "I think it was a fair package. " 

Michele Molotsky, organizer 
for the nurses union in San Diego, 
does not agree.

the Tritons to a 4-2 victory over Cal State Stanislaus in the 
NCAA Division III Midwest-Far West Regional Championship. 
The Tritons advance to the Quarterfinals next weekend, and 
will play Emory University from Atlanta. Time and location wfll 
be announced today. 

"Very little was accomplished 
[during the negotiations]," said 
Paula Mack, the chief representa-
tive for the UCSD nurses on the 
U C systemwide negotiating team. 
"CN A has decided to request arbi-
tration proceedings through the 
Public Employment Relations 
Board (PERB)."

ing unit, which is made up of 
about 400 members out of the

Campus Police ~Clamp Down' on Che Cafe 
New Policy Forces Cancellation of Saturday Event: Co-op Members Upset 

By LAURA PROCTOR 
Staff Writer 

The Che Cafe was forced to cancel its 
Saturday night event because of a new re-
quirement that the co-op pay $500 to have 
two police officers present. 

After they had already posted flyers and 
booked several bands, the Che members were 
informed that the event could only take place 
if they hired two policemen, which the non-
profit co-op cannot afford. 

"I think [the administration] ... is clamping 
down ... on us," said Co-op member G.B. 
Hajim, "so that students will spend their 
money at the Price Center." 

Assistant Vice-Chancellor of Undergradu-
ate Affairs Tom Tucker said he is "not aware" 
of a tightening of policy toward the Che, and 
explained that the Police Department assesses 
events on an individual basis to make security 
recommendations. 

In the past, the Che ha been allowed to 
police their own events. Hajim say that their 
record is clean, and that cu. tomer e en com-
plain about the trict ecurit) at the he. since 
both drug~ and al ohol are prohibited . 

He al,o said that the police were reacting to 
a single event a recent mushroom overdose 
that occurred ncar thc Rcvelle parl'dng lots 

FI,.r: This portion of a flyer advertiSing a 
Che CatS event has caused problems. 

which, Hajim aid. police "automatically con-
nected" with the Che. 

Hajim added that the police did not ay 
anything about a hi tory of drug problems and 
e pressed no di~ ati faction with Cheecur-
ity, until last week' sudden announcmenl. 

40Th y hold back information; then they 
unlea hit two day beforetheshow,"he ·ald. 

D Police Officer Rand Fedak '31d 

the new security requirement was due to the 
nature of Saturday'S event, as well as inci-
dents in the Che's past. 

"They've been having problems with alco-
hol and drugs ... we are getting calls from par-
ents wanting to knoVl why their kids are com-
ing home blasted from the Che," Fedak said . 

Fedak specifically cited the mushroom 
overdose, and said that Saturday's event "was 
being advertised as a pill party." 

Referring to a flier that the Che distributed 
on and off campus, Fedak said they "just had 
an overdose," and were now "advertising 
drugs." (See photograph). 

The flyer was a collage of psychedelic 
designs adorning an advertisement inviting 
Che goers into the "debauched dreams of 
frenzied fantasies" of the band performing 
that night. 

Co-op member HeidI Michem said the 
flyer was meant a a "joke." and that it's 
unfair that the police are judging security 
needs on the nature of the bands at Che Cafe 
events. She said at lea t one of the bands 
upports "San Diego Straight Edge," a n a nti-

drug group.

with two years experience receives 
$ 16.04 per hour and a nurse with 
four years experience starts out at 
$ 17.71 per hour, according to 
Kaiser nursing recruitment office 
figures. 

A top level clinical nurse at 
UCSD now makes $15.55 per 
hour, according to nursing asso-
ciation figures . . 

UCSD nurses are also fighting 
for wage parity between UCSD 
and other UC schools. 

The top level clinical nurse at 
UCLA now makes $16.21 per 
hour while the same position at 
UC San Francisco pays $17.80 
per hour, according to nursing 
association figures. 

Nurses find such wage dispar-
ity unfair.

San Diego is the same nursing

ASUC Davis Council 
Abolishes Use of ' Minority' 

DAVIS - The ASUC Davis council 
unanimously approved a resolution Thursday 
night encouraging the abolition of the term 
"minority" at ASUCD and all of its units. 

The resolution states that "the connotations of 
this term perpetuate racism and differential 
treatment by drawing a picture of inferiority." 

"Less than four percent of the world's popula-
tion are people who consider themselves white," it 
continues, adding, "there are more descriptive 
terms that could he utilized to describe the e 
[ non-white) groups."

UC Davis Police Impound 
All Bicycles Illegally Parked 

DAVIS - As of Oct. 26, 1988 the UC 
Davis Police Department will impound bicycles 
parked in violation of University codes. 

Policy announcements began several weeks ago, 
when members of the patrol issued yellow-slip 
warnings to illegally parked bikes. 

Depending on the number of violations spotted 
by the patrol, a truckload of bikes may be 
impounded. 

Unlicensed bikes will be given warnings. 
When violators pick up their impounded bikes 

at the police station, they are charged a $5 fine .

State Senator Torres to Speak 
at UCSD About Minorities in UC 

On Thursday, Nov. 10, State Senator Art 
Torres will speak at UCSD on "The Future of 
Hispanics/ Latinos in Higher Education." His 
presentation, which is sponsored by the UCSD 
Hispanic Staff Association, will be at 7:30 p.m. in

Senator Torres, who chairs the Senate Special 
Committee on University of California Admis-
sions, recently chaired a five-hour Committee 
hearing on allegations of racism and ethnic insen-
sitivity throughout the UC system. Speakers at 
the hearing claimed that the University made little 
effort to retain minority members of the faculty, 
and in fact often made it difficult for minority 
members to receive tenure. Non-whites. make up 

34.7 percent of the students at the nine UC cam-
puses, but only 12 percent of the faculty . 

After that hearing, Senator Torres ex pres ed 
fears that the UC chancellors would ignore the 

ept. 26 directive from UC President Gardner, 
that each campu increase efforts to include 
women and minorities in their faculties. "As I 
look at the 21st century, there is no one to take 
over the reigns of leadership," Torres said, "the 
white majority will become the white minority 
but will remain in control." His presentation on 
Thursday will immediately follow the next hear-
ing of the Senate Special Committee, which is 
schedule to address the growth and information 
on his presentaion, or on the reception which will 
follow, call Lucy Pearson at 534-1217.

NURSES: Ask UClor Wage, BenelitsParity 
Continued from page 1 
they are doing in San Francisco 
and L.A.," said Josie Caballa. a 
clinical nurse in the psychiatry 
unit. 

Greg Kramp, chief negotiator 
for the UC Board of Regents, says 
nursing salaries in general are 
higher in cities with longer histo-
ries of union activity and said that 
"bringing all 6,000 [UC] nurses up 
to San Francisco 's pay scales 
would cost the UC system $ 14.8 
million per year even if no other 
wage increase were granted ." 

San Francisco hospitals have a 
history of strong unions and 
UCSF has had collective bargain-
ing units for nurses for 30 years, 
according to Linda Proctor, a 
UCSD nurse and union leader. 

"Unions for nurses are still a 
new thing in San Diego ... we 
need more participation in unions 
[here)," she said. 

Guardian UCSD nurses are now nego-
tiating only their third contract, 
according to Proctor. 

Besides wage parity within the 
UC schools. there were many 
other proposals to which the 
administration did not respond 
positively. 

.. edlcal Cent.r: This UCSD facility in Hillcrest is the site of 
ongoing negotiations between the nurses ' union and Ihe UC 
administralion . 

Some of those proposals includ-
ed time and a half for all holidays 
and weekends worked, 40 hours 
paid education leave per year to 
help nurses maintain their licenses. 
$2 more per hour for the night 
shift, six months pregnancy leave 
and 24 days paid vacation after 10 
years of service. 

According to Molotsky, all 
these proposals are industry 
norms and are as important as the 
pay issues. 

Nurses are concerned not only 
with wage parity, but also with 
what they perceive as the under-
staffing of shifts, a problem the 
administration has not acknow-
ledged. 

According to Proctor, nurses 
often work 8 to 12-hour shifts 
without the benefit of legally 
required breaks although their 
contracts call for three 15-minute 
breaks and a 30-minute lunch 
period. • 

the number of nurses needed to 
care for a specific degree of illness 
stverity of a patient. 

Healey added that the nurses 
should schedule a meeting with 
her through the hospital's on site 
labor relations office to talk about 
the petition. 

The petition takes issue with 
staff cutbacks and was written in 
response to the new acuity system 
that, according to Mack, effected 
working conditions on the medi-
cal and surgical floors specifically. 

"For22 patients with X amount 
of acuity, there used to be six 
nurses scheduled for the day shift, 
now there are five. There used to 
be five on the night shift. Now 
there are four," she sa id. 

"The [administration) also 
decided that [the patients] did not 
need an all-registered nurse staff, 
so they replaced them with nurses 
aides - but this is not operation-
alized on all of the units ," Mack 
said. 

Caballa is "furious" when she 
sees nurses working overtime and 

not "charging it because they are 
afraid the supervisor will say they 
aren't organizing their time or 
working hard enough." 

Healey, however, said that , 
"Nurses are alway paid for 
approved overtime."

Two Pigs? 
The poli t ical cartoons of this ca mpaign that will 

someday decorate the textbooks for Hi tory 2C are of 
t" 0 pig , labeled "Bush" and "Dukakis ," wallowing in a 
muddy trough as a disgusted farmer ("t he voters") loo ks 
on. 

Why will the campaign be depicted this way? What are 
the charge tha t have ca used peo ple to throw up the ir 
hands in disgust! 
• There 's the America n Civil Li berties Unio n cha rgc by 

George Bush - that by supporting the ACL U Mic hael 
D ukakis su pports child pornogra phers a nd a~is . Bush 
knows that D ukakis , li ke mosl ACL backers, obj ect to 
ma ny ACLU sta nd s but believes in the pri nciple of a n 
advocate for those who think t hei r con titutional right 
have been tram pled . 

• There's the defen e charge by Bush - that Du ka kis 
is dangerously weak , or sus piciously soft, becau e he 
oppo e furt her defe nse spend ing increa es. Bush knows 
that Dukaki supports the last defe n e budget igned by 
President Reaga n and si mp ly wa nt to ea e off after eight 
yea rs of major defen e spendi ng increases. 
• There's the Willie Horto n charge - that Dukakis i 

soft o n cri me because of a tragedy d uring his guberna tor-
ial administration in which a bl ack man killed a wh ite 
ma n while on a weekend furlo ugh from priso n. Bush 
kno ws the fur lough progra m was initiated by a hard-on-
cri me Republ ican and that Dukakis sto pped it after the 

ENDORSEMENTS .. I 
H orton incident. Bu h also knows that by including Hor-
ton' pictu re on campaign flyers, he can care white 
voters in racially polarized areas. That's racism. 
• There's the Pledge of Allegiance charge - that Duka-

kis is unpatriotic by denying schoolchildren the right to 
say the pledge in the morning. Bush knows that what 
Duka kis objected to is the element of coercion, that he 
thinks any pledge should be made freel y. 
• There 's the Boston Harbor charge - that Dukaki has 

presided over the degradation of a beautiful bay. Bush 
knows that Duka kis, with no help f rom a Reaganist and 
o b tructionist Environmental Protection Agency, has 
fought hard to clean Boston Harbor and made substantial 
strides in doing so. 

Bush is making charges he knows are d is t o~t i ons of 
Dukakis' posi ti o ns and record , that he knows to be false . 
He's do ing so to push certai n react ionary buttons for hi s 
political advantage . That makes Bush a liar and a dema-
gogue. He is respons ible, with his rich man 's Ken doll of a 
running mate, for the squalor of th is campaign. 

Dukak is' share of responsi bility is in his utter failu re to 
effect ively combat the spurious Bush charges. The 
Duka kis campaign has been inept. 

But we urge a vote for Michael Dukakis tomorrow. His 
campaign may ha ve been poor, but his record is excellent. 
There is every reason to believe he would make an out-
standing president of the United States. 

He put togethe r a natio na lly envied health care system 
in Massachusetts, one which sat isfied doctors and hospi -
tals and pu t health care within rea ch of eve ry one of th e 
state's citi ze ns. 

He supports a woman 's right to an abort ion , to equal 
pay for equa l work and the fam ily's right to child care. 

He supports national self-determinat io n. He wants no 
co ntra / Somocista war responsi ble for th o usand s of 
death s in a cause backed by vi rtually no Nicaraguans . He 
wi ll support no Noriegas or a ny other dictators in the 
short-term interests of .. fo reign policy and to the 
long- te rm detriment of tha t dictator 's people. And . 
un like Bush vis-a-vis oreiga, he won't lie a bout it either. 

He has worked with a Democratic legis lature to bal -
ance o r nearly bala nce 10 sta te budgets de&pite a Reagan-
era shift of social welfare progra m to state responsibility 
conco mita nt with cut backs in federal financia l support. 

T he e a re the co re is ues of the nex t fo ur years 
bud get cutbacks, basic hea lth ca re for a nat ion in which 
fewe r a nd fe wer people ca n afford it , a rea listic and ca ring 
re-evaluation of U.S. foreign policy a la Jimmy Carter

T he following are excerpts of editorials endorsing can-
dida tes for U.S. President in the Guardian (formerly the 
Triton Times) since 1968. 
1968 

Lamenting a "sorry choice," the Triton Times offered 
no endorsement. Four days after the election , the paper 
ed ito rialized , "President-elect Richard Nixon. What kind 
of put-on is th is? . . . Like the ostrich, [Nixon voters] are 
trying to hide their head s in the sand by electing a man 
who cla ims he will wipe out problems with a show of 
fo rce. " 
1972 

T he TrilOn Times end orsed Democrats George 
McG overn and Sargent Shriver without explanation, but 
in June said "we unequivocally support McGovern .. . 
The Senator's stands on the war, taxes, welfare and public 
services bespeaks an awareness and concern for the real 
problems of this country." 
1976 

The Triton Times endorsed Arizona Democrat Morris 
Udall in the June primary without explanation, but 
refused to endorse either Carter or incumbent Gerald 
Ford in the fall , saying "neither seems to be the type of 
leader needed to lead America through these troubled and 
restle s times." 
1980 

The Daily Guardian offered no endorsement in the race 
between incumbent Democrat Jimmy Carter, Republican 
Reagan and independent John Anderson. 
J984 

The Guardian endorsed Democrats Walter Mondale 
and Gerald ine Ferraro without explanation. Two days 
after the election, the paper said " Ronald Reagan knows 
how to fool most of the people most of the time . .. 77 
percent of the voters [in the 18-24 age group] have decided 
to completely ignore the future in favor of their own 
personal concerns."

Letters 

Liberals are Intolerant 
Editor: 

Your response to Mr. Gutierrez's letter regarding Q & 
A ("What should Reagan do before he leaves office?", 
Guardian, Oct. 24) raises a few key issues regarding the 
current presidential campaign. Gutierrez stated that the 
opinions presented were not reflecti ve of all viewpoints 
held by UCSD students, presenting only those that were 
anti-Reagan in nature. You responded by declaring your 
policy is to represent a "variety" of viewpoints, and that all 
questioned in the random survey spoke unfavorably 
about President Reagan. 

I find it interesting that your policy is to represent a 
"variety" of viewpoints , rather than "any" or "all" view-
points at UCSD (in other words, might there bea particu-
lar "variety" of viewpoints you prefer to represent?). 
Furthermore, it is my belief that most UCSD students, 
when asked such a serious question, would respond with 
an equally serious and meaningful answer. 

The off-the-wall and flippant statements made by those 
photographed (regardless of whether or not they were 
pro-Reagan) make one wonder if it was really presented in 
a thoughtful and impartial manner. It is very easy for bias 
to enter such a survey. 

Bush and Quayle have both capitalized in recent 
months on a seemingly ridiculous policy of making Mlib-
eral" a cussword and by representing themselves as 
underdogs victimized by a biased and intolerant press. 
Asking why it has worked brings up some important 
lessons to be learned by all, particularly the press. 

It is certainly not a crime to be liberal, and it is no crime 
to be a member of the press. However, when the press 
(such as the Guardian) slants its articles so far as to lose 
impartiality in their cont-.:nt: the readers lose respect for

Socialized Journalism 
By PHIL GR UEN 
SportS Editor 

On an average Monday or 
Thursday, you probably pick up a 
Guardian, read or skim through it 
briefly, and tos it. Basically, you 
take the issue for granted . You 
don't once think of the hard work 
and train that we, the editors, 
had to end ure in order to produce 
this i sue. 

ow 1 can understand if you 
picked up the Los Angeles Times 
or San Diego Union and read 
those papers without co nsidering 
the work that was put into them, 
but those people work on news-
papers for a living! We don't . We 
go to school for a living (or do 
we? I think some of the editors 
around here would beg to differ). 
But still. . . you don't give us any 
credit at all! Aaaaaarrrrgh! 

To tell you the truth, I wa just 
kid ding. 

If you ever bother to ramble by 
the Guardian office on Wednes-
day or Sunday nights (production 
nights) you would witness some 
unbelievable antics. It's amazing 
we ever get any issues out at all 
(let alone on time, which is extreme-
ly rare) considering the serious-
ness, or, more appropriately, lack 
thereof, that exis ts. 

Believe it or not , 1 did a bit of 
research before I started writing 
this article. Don't get me wrong; it 
wasn't as if I needed to put a great 
deal of thought into it , but 1 fig-
ured some precise examples of 
unsuspecting editors would fur-
ther my poi nt. In other words, 
over the last couple of weeks 1 
decided to do some covert note-
taking on some of the crucial top-
ics and issues that are discussed 
during the production hours from 

OPINION 

8 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. These partic-
ular hour are es pecially impor-
tant because we have a I a .m. 
deadline to get the flat s to the 
printer in Enci nitas before they 
charge us $60 for each half hour 
we are late. 

I' ll admit that we've been 
improving a bit lately, but the 
news and sports sections alone 
presumably cost the Guardian 
$500 in the first couple of weeks. 
Let's take a close-up look at some 
quotes which pretty much set the 
tone for an evening and contrib-
ute highly 10 our general staff 
delinquency. 

"Where are my fries?" 
" Hey Rick, you gonna get Sean 

to cut your hair?" 
"Lara, do you need any help 

eating that Whopper?" 
"It's amazing. I've lived in ew 

Mexico all my life and I never 
learned to ski! Julie, you've gotta 
teach me to ski ." 

"I stay away from girls with red 
hair, too, for that matter. " 

The quotes alone, however, do 
not do enoughjustice to the activ-
ities that the editors take part in 
on production nights . Here 's a 
familiar situation: 

Time: 10:15 p.m. 
Newspaper : Nowhere near 

done. 
There are live important staff 

members ( man agi ng editor , 
editor-in-chief, graphics edito r, 
assistant photo editor, and music 
editor) huddled anxiously around 
the editor-in-chiefs desk . Some 
natural assumptions the average 
person may conj ure would be that 
these important people are dis-

perhaps these people are contest-
ing over the sense invovled in

certain way. But no. These people 
are conducting an important 
debate as to whose Burger K.ing 
food belongs to whom. 

N ow don't get the idea that I'm 
above this sort of activity. Oh no. 
[ merely join in on the festivities , 
happily selecting my fries and 
wondering why Lara got me a 
Coke instead of a root beer. 

How and where do we find all 
the time to fool around to such an 
extent? Nobody knows for sure, 
but there are a few reasons that 
spring immediately to mind ; one 
being that we have a typesetting 
system that is more primitive than 
Ben Franklin's printing press, and 
two, we are more of a social clique 
than a newspaper staff. 

Concerning the former, plans, 
which are likely to turn into real-
ity at least by springtime, are cur-
rently underway for a new system 
of production involving Apple 
Macintosh Computers and some 
sort of laser printer. 

As the latter goes, however, I 
don't think we'd stand for it any 
other way. You see, during these 
production nights, we may bicker, 
argue, and light, but we also have 
a good time and develop strong 
friendships that could last a life-
time. If we turn in the paper late, 
~hen. so be it. We enjoyed produc-
mg It, and some of us wouldn't 
trade production nights for any-
thing. 

So next time you pick up the 
Guardian, think about all the 
diligence and extreme effort that 
was put into its production. Then 
think again .

New Institute of Americas 
Head Tours Latin Nations 
By JILL COLLEY 
StajJ Writer 

The Institute of the America's 
new president , Paul Boeker, re-
cently returned from a visit to 
Lat in America where he met with 
the presidents and other polit ical 
leaders of t he democratic coun-
tries of Latin America. 

Boeker has made two visit to 
Latin America within the past few 
months. On his mo t recent visit, 
he completed the last of 26 inter-
views with the presidents of nine 
countries as well a seventeen 
other political figures. 

Boeker spoke with these lead-
ers to gather information for a 
book he is writing on Latin Amer-
ica's "renaissance of democracy." 
He calls the theme of his new 
book "democracy without il-
lusion." 

Boeker said he feels that the 
prevalence of elected democratic 
civilian governments in Latin 
America today is "historically 
significant" and said he believes 
democracy now has a more "solid 
footing"in Latin America because 
the people have "a much more 
realistic expectation of leader-
ship." 

"It is ironic that you have 
democratic government flourish-
ing in Latin America at a time of 
economic crisis. At a time when 
you would expect people to be 
turning against their leaders, the 
fact that they have not turned 
against democracy indicates that 

the system is st ronger than it has 
been in the past ," Boeker said . 

Boeker assumed the presidency 
of the Institute of the Americas in 
June of thi year. 

He has held ambassadorial 
posts under both President Rea-
gan and Pres ident Carter and was 
formerly Director of the Foreign 
Service Institute. 

The I nstitute of the Americas 
was founded in 1984 and is a pri-
va te , non-profit , non-partisan 
organization dedicated to fos ter-
ing understanding and facilitating 
communication between the busi-
ness, public and academic sectors 
of the Americas. 

Boeker said that the primary 
aim of his presidency is "to make 
the Institute of the Americas a 
catalyst in helping the United 
States and Latin America define 
the right issues." 

He said he believes this to be a 
particularly imponant function 
ofthe Institute of the Americas at 
this time because of the election 
year transition taking place in the 
United States as well as transi-
tions in many countries of Latin 
America. 

"I n all of the larger countries of 
the Western Hemisphere you have 
a political transition, new leader-
ship, and a period of new begin-
nings. Therefore, this is a very 
imponant time to try to define 
what are the major issues that 
ought to be confronted by that 
new leadership, n Boeker com-
mented.

New Info. Booth Opens 
By RANDY DOTINGA 
Contributing Writer 

UCSD students will avoid the 
hassle of being asked for direc-
tions by lost visitors, if the new 
Gilman Information Booth ful-
fills its function. 

The booth, which officially 
opened Oct. 19, is located on 
Gilman Drive near La Jolla Vil-
lage Drive and is run by the 
UCSD Parking Office in con-
junction with the Public lnforma-
tion Office. 

According to Parking Office 
Supervisor Suzette Monette, the 
booth's purpose is to provide vis-
itors with campus directions and 
event information. give general 

information about the University 
and sell half-day and full-day 
parking permits. 
The booth. whichis open from 7 

a.m. to 9 p.m. weekdays, 9 a .m. to 
9 p.m. Saturdays and 9 a .m. to 5 
p . m. Sundays, has served an 
average of 65 people a da y, 
Monette sa id , explaining that the 
hour are only tentati ve. 

"We will extend or reduce our 
hours as necessary," she said. 

Although the booth ha s a 
drive-thru lane, dri ve rs must 
park and walk to the service win-
dow to get help. 

Monette explained that because 
ofthe booth's design, an employee 
would have to leave the building 
to help a drive-thru customer. 

Due to the security risk this poses, 
the drive I hrough lane will remain 
closed until two workers staff the 
booth at one time. 

When a ll the new information 
booth are built (one is planned to 
open within the next yea r on the 
north side of campus), the drive-
thru problem will be corrected, 
she said. 

The only other major problem 
with the booth sn far has been the 
theft of four flags from large flag-
poles on the center divider of 
Gilman Drive in front of the 
booth . 

Four American flags will re-
main on the flagpole until re-
placements for the stolen flags 
a rrive. The flagpoles will then 
hold United States, California, 
University of California and 
UCS D flags. according to Mo-
nette.

OPINION 

Censorship is Undemocratic 
Editor: 

Thi letter was written in re-
sponse to Joe Wainio's call to cut 
the Koala fund (Guardian. Oct. 
24). 

The fo llowing repre ents my 
personal v iews. as author of the 
cartoon "Confucius Sez" and a 
Managing Editor of the Koala. 
The major points I intend to con-
veyare: I) The cartoon was never 
intended to be interpreted as 
racist. 2) Cutting funding for a 
campus media due to it's content 
is legally considered censorship. 
3) There is a grave threat to the 
liberty of all tudents caused by 
calls for censorship. 

Admittedly the cartoon does 
have a dimension of internation-
alism . H owever, what you see at 
first may be only part of the 
image, or even a false one. ( Did 
you know that "tree" is the official 
international way in English to 
pronounce three? As "zeeroh" is 
for zero. These are especially use-
ful for inte rnational ham radio 
operators. This , by the way. does 
make the Profs prollunciation 
correct!) 

The most important issue is the 
threat to the freedom of students 

pre ented by certain individuals. 
All too freque ntly individuals. 
under t he vei l of righteousness or 
progress attempt to destroy the 
hard won rights of students and 
others. 

T hese malcontents are often 
determined to a ttack the fabric of 
democracy in their effort to crush 
the evil spectres they see in every 
facet of life. Don't be fooled by 
these malicious or misguided 
individuals. They are a grave 
threat to all students, and the 
American society itself. 

These anti-constitutional ele-
ments wish to undermine our 
rights by calling for the repression 
of free speech and free press gua-
ranteed by the First Amendment. 
Often they will operate under mis-
leading names to conceal their 
true purpose. This is the case with 
Students for a Democratic Edu-
cation. T here is nothing demo-
cratic about censorship! 

Frequent ly these individuals 
will claim to have popular sup-
port. Notice how they will distort 
the truth . A recent letter in the 
Guardian claimed that members 
from Students for a Democratic 
Education (SFDE) approached 

The U SD Guardian 

the editors of the A:oala . Fa1 
from it. I wa approached by two 
members of the APSA with re-
gards to their concerns a bout the 
cartoon. In the end we were able 
to comc to an understanding. 
Then another person entered the 
tail end of the co nversa tion, 
determined to have a disrupting 
affect. He happened to "be there". 
He did not make an attempt to 
approach the ed itors . He simply 
was a n opportunist , finding an-
other cause to satisfy his ego and 
continue his personal hatred of 
the Koala. Later he distorts the 
truth so that it would seem that 
members of the SFDE were 
involved, when it was simply a 
lone individual. 

That particular individual 
called for the decimation of the 
Koala budget. He very well knows 
that he is calling for censorship. 
Any ca ll to cut the budget of any 
campus media due to it's content 
is legally considered flagrant cen-
sorship. This has been established 
by several previous court cases 
involving campus med;a from dif-
ferent sides of the political spec-
trum. at UCSD. He certainly is 
well aware of this fact due to his 
past active membership on one of 
the alternative medium which had 
all too often to defend its' first

censorship they are attempting to 
silence freedom and to implement 
tyranny with the imposition of 
their views onto others. This hap-
pened in Nazi Germany. We can-
not nor should not let such a 
threat to democracy happen here 
in the United States. (Nor a ny-
where else for that matter.) 

Democracy rests upon basic 
ideological pilla rs, of which one 
of the greatest is free speech. The 
rights we have are the rights we 
are able to defend . When we are 
no longer able or willing to defend 
those rights (such as the right to 
vote) is when we lose our free-
dom. This has happened with the 
social life at UCSD, let us not let 
it happened to our basic constitu-
tional rights .

Liberals 
Continued from pale 4 
the opinions these a rticles pres-
ent. This is true for conservative 
publication as well as your own, 
which. like most journalistic ef-
forts, leans toward a Ii beral stance. 

With regard to your news stories 
co veri ng the recent presidential 
cam paign appearances on cam-
pus, let the candidates make their 
own new without your help. 

The Republican campaign has 
succeeded in downgrading liber-
als because liberals now have a 
greater reputation for intolerance 
of others ' opinions than do con-
servatives . This I find to be a sorry 
state of affair, since the term 
"li beral" has been and should be 
associated with open-mindedness. 
It now appears that extremism, 
whether to the right or to the left, 
breeds intolerance and closed-
minded ness. Only too often those 
who disagree with liberals are 
presented as racist and prejudiced . 

T he reason why " Reagan Demo-
crats" exist at all is because the 
conservative Republ ican party ha 
been a ble to successfully woo 
moderates (a .k .a . the majority of 
American voters) by appearing 
more ensi tive to their needs than 
the more liberal Democratic party. 

It 's a sad state of affairs when 
the voters must seek the people 
who spawned the Mora l Majority 
to find t he mo t open-minded 
leaders to best represent them.

DUESBERG: Retrovirologist Lectures 
On HIV, Takes Issue With AIDS Link 
Continued from page I 
in addition to not being s ufficient 
to cause AIDS by itself, infection 
with HI V "may not even be neces-
sary for AIDS." because for a 
virus to cause disease it must be 
biochemically acti ve in the cells it 
infects. 

"The A I DS virus is not reactive 
when it causes disease," he said , 
explaining that, "the hallmark of 
AIDS is a deplet ion of T -cells [a 
type of white blood cell]." 

While granting 'that HIV does 
infect these cells. Duesberg said 
that, " Viral RNA synthesis [as a 
measure of viral activity] is detec-
table in and out of 10,000 cells at 
most." 

To prove that a microorganism 
causes a disease, it must be possi-
ble to isolate the microorganism 
from every case diagnosed , 
Duesberg said. 

While it is now accepted that 
HIV can be isolated from 80-100 
percent of all AIDS cases, Dues-
berg questions the significance of 
these findings. saying that the 
virus was in some cases "squeezed 
out" in quantities too tiny to be 
meaningful. 

Taking issue with these state-
ments, Oxman noted that in con-
genital rubella , millions of cells in 
the heart show altered behavior 
as a result of the infection, al-
though only .01 percent of those 
cells are actually infected with the 
rubella virus . 

Oxman further observed that 
"no one questions that .chicken 
pox is caused by an infectious 
virus transmitted through the 
respiratory system, even though 
the best virologists . .. can't isolate 
chicken pox from the respiratory 
tract during that time [when the 
infection is contagious]." 

Proofthat persons infected with 
HIV actually develop AIDS is 

also lacking, Duesberg claimed. 
" Most exposures do not lead to 

what is ca lled seroconversion 
[development of AIDS symp-
toms]," he said. 

DuesbergaJso criticized the fact 
that much of the evidence that 
HIV causes AIDS depends on 
what he considers "anecdotal" cor-
relations between incidences of 
AIDS and HIV infection. Use of 
such evidence, he said, has led to 
"spectacular misdiagnosis" in the 
past. 

"AI DS is estimated to appear 
an average of eight years after the 
appearance of the antibody, "said 
Duesberg, going on to explain 

that it is ext remely unusual for a 
vi rus to lie dormant for so long 
and then cause symptoms after 
the production of antibodies. 

Duesberg did agree that there is 
a limited correlation between H IV 
and AIDS. 

.. Although H I V does not appear 
to cause AIDS," he said . "i t may 
serve in the United States and 
Europe as an indicator of the ri sk 
of AIDS." 

In these countries HIV is large-
ly co nfined to those popUlations 
which also are at high risk for 
AIDS. he said . A further concern 
raised by Duesberg involved the 
use of AZT, a drug reported to 
have many harmful side effects, 
to treat persons infected with HIV 
even in the abscence of AIDS 
symptoms. "Based on a hypothe-
sis they cannot prove," Duesberg 
said , patients are being treated 
with AZT. 

Friday's lecture was the second 
of a two lecture series given by 
Duesberg. The first lecture, given 
Thursday at the UCSD Center 
for Molecular Genetics, dealt with 
the topic of cancer-causing genes. 
The lectures were sponsored by 
the UCSD Laboratory of Cancer 
Biology.

Food Services Switches to Set Precedent 

Campus-wide Styrofoam Ban Sought 
By ANDREA ADLEMAN 
Cont ribUlillg Writer 

Reform-mi nd ed stud ents at 
UCSD might addres the follow-
ing issues: the bureaucracy in 
general, the lines at the Registrar. 
the parking problem. and filled 
c1as es . 

Due t.o the efforts of a s mall but 
vocal group of students, a fifth 
item has been added to the list; 
the use of styrofoam on campus. 

Food Services 

The leaders in this effort to 
eliminate sty rofoam on the 
UCS D campus, all from cripps 
Institution of Oceanography, have 
presented their case to Food Ser-
vices . As a result, Food Services is 
discontinuing u e of the material. 

ow, thegroupi ca mpaigning 
for a campu -wide ban on the u e 
of styrofoam, indudingany other 
food vend ors a nd private depart-

mental meetings. 
The public i beginning to 

become aware of the inherent 
problem in styrofoam, yet many 
are oblivious to the repercussions 
of the envIronmentally dangerou 
product. David Wilmot, an SIO 
graduate student and one of the 
leaders of the effort to ban styro-
foam, explains the fo ur main 
points of the group's argument 
agai nst the material. 

The Ozone Layer 
"The fir t problem, and possi-

bly the most important, is chloro-
fluorocarbons (C FCs), which 
have been proven to cau e des-
Huction to the ozone layer," 
Wilmot said . "Styrofoam manu-
fact urers have begun to cut those 
out and it 's not as big a problem 
as it was previously," he added. 

"The second problem is that ... 
styrofoam i non-biodegradable, 
therefore it is going to end up in 
the landfills . It is going to be there 
forever, so even if it is disposed of 

properly, it is going to take an 
incredible amount of space to 
dispose of it." Wilmot said. 

"Thirdly, it e nds up in the . 
environment. It ends up in ani-
mals'stomach and it kills them. A 
lot of marine birds, for example, 
eat it. and it kills them, too. And 
the fourth problem isjust the aes-
thetics problem. It washes up on 
the beaches. Because it is non-
biodegradable, it won't go away," 
Wilmot added. 

Additional Cost 
Wilmot and his two colleagues 

at SIO, graduate students Craig 
Cary and Don Croll, called the 
attention of Food Services and 
Chancellor Atkinson to these 
problems. Despite the additional 
cost of paper, Food Services will-
ingly converted, noting their con-
cern for the environment and 
UCSD's responsibility as a 
leader in preserving it. 

"UCS D is a technologically 

progressive university, " said 
Food Services Director Brian 
Klippel. "We are in the forefront 
in that respect , and we should be 
in the forefront in ecological 
issues. We decided [eliminating 
styrofoam] is the right thing to 
do." 

Sharing a goal with the 10 
students, Klippel hopes to see the 
"whole campus move in that 
direction. Like smoking, UCSD 
took a progressive stand. We 
want to promote a styrofoam-free 
environment, like a smoke-free 
environment. .. 
Student Pressure 

Several months ago , Food 
Services heeded pressure from a 
group of students and replaced 
styrofoam plates with paper ones . 
At that time, Food Services felt 
that there was no substitute for 
styrofoam cups to serve hot 
liquidS. 

According to Associate Direc-
tor of Food Services Wini 
McGuane , upon hearing the 

pated negative reaction by cus-
tomers. 

Customer Re.etion 

"We envision some customers 
who prefer styrofoam," Klip~1 
said . "Our response to them IS 
that we're doing our part for the 
ecology and hope [they] under-
stand. We feel that the customers, 
when they understand why, will 
buy into it." 

Expanding on his beliefthat all 
should contribute to the envir-
onmental effort, Klippel added 
that "public universities have an 
obligation to do their part. All 
departments at UCSD should 
[also] do their part . That's why 
we're doing it." 

Wilmot sees similar dilemmas 
in society as a whole. 

Lonl-term Problems 

_____________ -., SIO students' case, "We [Food 
Services] saw that even though we 
cannot be as comfortable with 
paper, we better stop [usingstyro-
foam] altogether." 

"Because of the long-term 
problems, we have to be a little 
more farsighted than to look at 
the quick fix," he said. "That has 
been the problem with the envir-
onmental movement in this coun-
try for a long time. The adminis-
trators and the politicians can't 
really think of long-term solu-
tions .. . because they're only

Former CIA Agent Speaks 
Out A bout Covert Action 
By VINCENT A DRADE 
Staff Writer 

Since its creation in 1947, the 
CIA's policy has been to murder 
individuals and topple govern-
ments which threaten U.S . corpo-
rations' inte rests, according to 
Philip Agee, a former CIA agent 
under George Bush. In a recent 
lecture at UCSD, he outli ned var-
ious questionable action carried 
out by the CI A in the name of 
democratic principles. 

Among the issues presented by 
Agee at his lec ture were: CIA 
recruitment of Nazi war crimi-
nals, C IA-backed military dicta-
torships, the CIA-drug connec· 
tion and former CIA director 
and ' c urrent presidentia l can-
didate George Bush. 

In the late 1940s the C IA's 
involvement in the Cold War 
included the recruitment of Nazi 
war criminals and collaborators 
"for intelligence operations of all 
Orts; [the CIA] protected and got 

them ettled with new identities 
... including in the U.S ." Agee 
said . 

According to Agee, the C IA's 

recruitment of these people into 
para-military grou ps for subvert-
ing and overthrowing Eastern 
European governments set a pre-
cedent. 

In th~ 1950s a nd 1960 , "The 
C IA mounted what [was] the 
equivalent of the contra opera-
tion today, again t China , Thai-
land, the Philippines [and] Viet-
nam . All were the scene of 
extensive paramilitary oper-
at ions," Agee said. 

He added that Reagan's cur-
rent co ntra operation against the 
Sandinista government of Nica-
ragua is the continuation of a pol-
icy which originated 40 yea rs ago 
wi th the use of Nazi war cri minals 
in C IA-backed paramilitary 
organtzattons. . 

Acco rd i ng t o Agee, pa ra -
military orga nizations a nd su bsi-
diary intelligence organizations 
were used in the e~tablishment of 
far-right military dictatorships in 
Greece by the C IA , following 
Greece's 1947-49 civil war. 

In Iran, in the mid-1950s, Agee 
said the CIA developed an Iran-
ian secret police to maintain the 
military dictatorship of the Shah. 
Agee sta ted that the Iranian ceret 

police "became famous for its tor-
ture chambers and assassination 
of polit ical opponents o f the 
Shah." 

Likewise, following the Korean 
War, the CIA set up the Korean 
CIA in South Korea which 
remains to this day "the principle 
institut ion for political control in 
that country," Agee said . 

Agee's work as a CIA agent 
from 1957-69 focused mainly on 
Ibera-America (Latin America) , 
and involved repressio n and 
counter-democratic revolution, he 
said. 

"In the C IA we knew all about 
restoring democracy - by replac-
ing democratically-elected civilian 
governments with military dicta-
tors hips," Agee said . 

Focusing on EI Salvador, Agee 
asserted , "you can be absoluJe!y 
assured that the CIA is working 
around the clock daiiy with the 
murderous security forces of El 
Salvador." These forces are 
responsible for "60,000 to 70,000 
deaths since the Reagan adminis-
tration started its support pro-
gram for the government of El 
Salvador ... most of those 60,000 
to 70.000 victims have been picked

ces ' attitude is a result of antici-

up, kidnapped , tortured to death 
or mutilated, and their bodies 
have been thrown along roads, 
down ravines , or into rivers and 
lakes," he said . 

According to Agee, the pattern 
of an attempt at democracy and 
then CIA-backed reaction has 
been repeated in other I bero-
American countries throughout 
the CIA's short history: Guatam-
ala in 1954, Ecuador in 1962, 
Brazil in /964, and Chile in 1973. 
The U.S. view oflbero-American 
representative democracy is char-
acterized by Agee as "wonderful 
when it is pliant and submissive 

like [CIA-backed] regimes, unac-
ceptable if too independent, too 
nationalist , populist, or socialist." 

According to Agee, the CIA's 
relationship to I bero-America, the 
Iran-contra scandal, and the cur-
rent drug epidemic in America 
are reflected in the Reagan 
administration and the candidacy 
of Vice President George Bush. 

Referring to Barbara Trent's 
documentary "Cover-up," Agee 
inferred that the reason the true, 
alarming scale of the Iran-Contra 
scandal was not revealed was

elected for a couple of years ." 

Not only styrofoam, but all 
plastics have become the target of 
Food Services' elimination efforts. 
Because all plastics are non-
biodegradable, and therefore dis-
posed of in landfills, Food Servi-
ces is experimenting with was hi ng, 
sterilizing and reusing the plastic 
silverware prevalent in the cam-
pus restaurants. 

Although paper. the replace-
ment product, is recyclable, Food 
Services is concerned with the 
volume of its consumption. To 
help decrease paper usage, it will 
offer a five cent discount on the 
price of a medium size eup of cof-
fee to customers who bring their 
own cups. 

C.mp .... wide a.n 

person Stuart Spector, having 
researched the subject, recognizes 
the harmful effects of the CFCs in 
some styrofoams and ha taken 
action. 

" I don't use aerosol spray can 
[which can also contain CFCs]," 
Spector said. "And I try to dis-
courage others from doing so. I'm 
opposed to the use of CFCs. It is 
true that even if production were 
to stop now, CFCs would still be 
in the stratosphere at the turn of 
the century. Thus we need to ban 
CFC products and use substitute 
products ... 

Public A w.reness 
Conveying a common theme 

among all involved , Spector 
stresses the importance of public 
education. "Most of all, we have 
to make people aware of the 
importance of [replacing styro-
foam] ," he said. 

the issues concerning styrofoam. 
So that more cu tomers around 

the country complain about res-
taurants' use of styrofoam, . Wil-
mot co-founded and currently 
serves as national co-chairman of 
the Students for Environmental 
Awareness, an organization dedi-
cated to education about the eco-
logical issues, including styro-
foam . 

Positive Results 
Wilmot sees numerous positive 

results of a group's conversion to 
paper products. UCSD Food 
Services endeavored to make a 
change. To Wilmot and his col-
leagues, Food Servjces' change, 
although subtle, will be beneficial 
for the environment. 

Abandoning styrofoam "could 
be a great learning experience for 
13,000 students on our campus, " 
Wilmont said . Recognizing the 
scope of UCSD's influence on 
account of its size, Wilmont con-
cluded. "What better way to teach

scandal, Agee stated that the fin- Ibero-American politics . The

operation known as the 'Arms r-------------------------------------__________________________________________________________________ ___ 
Supermarket.' " 

There is significant support for 
a campus-wide ban on styrofoam. 
Eduardo Rallo-Verdugo, man-
ager of the Grove Caffcf, has 
decided to convert to paper, hop-
ing that customers "know that we 
are doing it for everyone." Fresh-

The styrofoam controversy is 
gaining nationwide recognition. 
As Stuart and the others hoped , 
the effect of such publicity is that 
the public is looking critically at ethics than by example?" 

Agee described how the Contra 
resupply operation known as the 
• Arms Supermarket' was about to 
be uncovered when Eugene 
Hasenfus was shot down over 
Nicaragua. 

According to Agee, upon dis-
covering the downing of the plane 
in Nicaragua, the person in charge 
of the contra-resupply network, 
Felix Rodriguez, made a call to 
Washington D.C. 

"Where does Rodriguez make 
his first telephone call to raise the 
alarm that the plane has gone 
down? He calls Bush's office." 
Agee said . 

In fact, he continued, the arms-
for-hostages deal in which Bush 
played a role, reflected former 
CIA director William Casey's 
decision to shift from the money-
laundering network of the Medil-
lin Cocaine Cartel to other means 
of financing the Contras, fearing 
imminent exposure of the CIA-
drug connection. 

Another example Agee gives of 
the Bush-CIA-drug connection 
concerns . a 1975 Jus,tice Depart-
ment investigation of corruption 
in the Drug Enforcement Agency. 

"The results of that investiga-
tion," Agee said, "show that 
Manuel Noriega was up to his 
neck in drug-dealing." Agee 
explained that the resulting re-
port, completed in June, 1975, 
was transmitted to the CIA . 
Nevertheless, in January, 1976. 
newly-appointed CIA director 
George Bush met with Manuel 
Noriega, chief of Panamanian 
intelligence. 

"There is no way that Bush 
would not have been informed of 
the close CIA-relationship with 
Noriega and, of course, of Nori-
ega's drug-running operations" as 
far back as 1976, Agee said. 

Agee speculated that if he had 
been Michael Dukakis debating 
George Bush he would have surely 
pointed out, "Mr. Bush, what the 
American people want first in a 
president is honesty, and they're 
not going to get it from you until 
you answer clearly and completely 
what your office was doing in 
these illegal, drug-financed , re-
supply operations for the Con-
tras ... 

Agee said that the abortive 
attempts at democracy around 
the world, especially since WWll , 
which have resulted in murdered 
individuals and failed govern-
ments, involve to a significant

By CHRIS KRANTZ 
COlllribllling Writer 

T racey was not asking for much . It was cold inside his San Francisco hospital 
room and all he wanted was for 
someone to give him a blanket. 
He wished he could get up from 
the bed and get it himself, but his 
body was much too weak to do 
even this now. 

In the last few months he had 
developed a profuse case of diar-
rhea, wasting syndrome (fevers , 
night sweats, weight 10 s) and 
skin eruptions and swelling in the 
lymph nodes . Tracey called 
through the intercom, "Someone, 
please anyone .. . I need a blanket. 
It's freezing in here," but no one 
answered. 

Hours later , while he lay shiver-
ing between the sheets, a doctor 
came into the room. Tracey asked 
him for a blanket. The doctor re-
plied , "It's not my job." Tracey 
broke down into a humiliating 
plea for help. 

Finally, the doctor went out 
and around the corner to get him 
a blanket. Tracey was dying of 
AIDS. 

According to Robert C . Cecchi 
of New York City's Gay Men's 
Health Crisis, "AIDS patients are 
sometimes turned away from 
hospital emergency rooms, even 
when they have symptoms of 
pneumonia. Ambulance drivers 

occa sionally refu e phys ical con-
tact with the patients." 

An orderly at Mt. Zion Medi-
cal Center in San Francisco left a 
patient with AIDS sitting in a 
wheel chair in a lobby as he went 
off to find a pair of gloves. 

Why are people so panicked by 
AIDS? It may be that the scien-
tific community isjust not getting 
its message through. 

This coming week (Monday, 
Nov . 7 through Friday, Nov. 11) 
the UCSD AIDS Education and 
Prevention Task Force, in con-
junction with the Student Health 
Services and Associated Students, 
is presenting a collection of edu-
cational and cultural activities 

proposi tion raises the questi on of 
a person's civil rights. 

The National Center for Dis-
ease Control is currently conduct-
ing a stud y which could also be 
seen as a violation of civil rights. 
The study is designed to deter-
mine the number of individuals 
on 20 randomly selected college 
campuses who have the Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus , known 
as the precursor to AIDS. 

The problem with the survey is 
that it is involuntary. Students 
will have no way of knowing 
whether or not their blood will be 
sent to the CDC in Atlanta. This 
raises controversial questions of 
health education and civil rights . 

On Wednesday (noon- I p.m.) 
in the North Conference Room, 
Student Center A) T im Grum-
mon will speak on art as a thera-
peutic med ium for people with 
AIDS . His art work will be dis-
played in the U rey Hall Science and 
Engineering Library display case. 
Also, a scene from the prize-
winning play "AS IS," confront-
ing the issue of AIDS with both 
compassion and humor, will be 
performed by Stage Works (3:30 
p.m.-4:30 p.m. in the North Con-

FEATURES The UCSD Guardian 

Satirist Performs at Del Coronado 
Mark Russells Up Laughter at Med School Benefit 

"T hirty years ago, if you 
would have told me what 

I would be talking about o n stage 
today, I would not have believed 
you," said Mark Russell , political 
atirist, aturday nigh t at a dinner 

dance benefit for the UCSD 
Medical Center. 

One of the things he was talk-
ing about at the Hotel Del Coro-
nado event wa the labeling of 
social stereoty pes in tbe '80s . 
He arcastically remarked, " I have 
see n the future ... I've seen it ... 
it's weird that you consider that in 
the next centu ry you are going to 
have people in old folks home 
named Heather and Debbie." 

As part of his act, Russell si ngs 
and accompanie his co mic tune 
on the piano while standing. One 
song, called "The T-word," played 
on Dukakis' reluctance to say the 
word, "tax" while campaigning. 
"Although we never hearthe word, 
we know it when we pay it," Rus-
sell sa ng. 

He focused his satire on Los 

Angeles when he said, "The two 
favorite sports in L.A. are jogging 
and helping a divo rced friend 
move." 

No political, cultural, or pro-
fessional group was safe from 
Russell's good hllmored satirical 
ridicule . 

Speaking on the Reagan' re-
cent visit to Moscow, he con-
cluded that "Nancy and Raisa 
should give it up; the chemist ry 
isn't there!" 

Russell added that after a day 
in Moscow," ancy had her taff 
working all afternoon looking up 
the Russian word for ' bitch'." 

Commenting about the chang-
ing times, Russell commented that, 
"Kids are very sophisticated these 
days. The other day. two five-
year-old kids were talking; one 
said, 'I just found a condom on 
the patio.' The other said, 'What 's 
a patio?' " 

He also joked about how one 
generation has received all the 
media attention during the last 
30 years; commenting that the 

data 
systems 

SA VES YOU $$$$$ 

sa me generation got attention a s 
the babies of the baby boom, the 
hippies of the '60s and '7 Os , the 
Yuppies of the '80s and , most 
recently, the OINKs (Double 
Income 0 Kids) of the future. 

Russell complained that he, on 
the other hand, is a member of the 
"10 t generation" ignored by the 
media . 

Ex plaining his generation's lack 
of publicity, he confessed, "We 
dared to be dull. Yes si r, we had 
T-shirts, but what wa written on 
them? NOTHING!" 

Complaining that his genera-
tion was never labeled with a 
catchy acronym , Ru sse ll an-
nounced the creation of his own 
label. ''I'm forming a group called 
PODWOGs; Parents of OINKs 
Without Grandchildren." 

The majority of proceeds from

ogy Department of the UCSD

Calder, and Tom Schatz, all cor-
ing two goals apiece. The Bruins' 
sco ring primarily came from 
Alexis Rousseau and Hank Peter-
so n, both of whom scored three 
goals. Goalie Randy Franke also 
turned in a terrific game for the 
Tritons, making six saves. 

UCLA was clearly a bigger and 
tronger team, and they had a lot 

more depth. The Bruins carry a

Ro mmel, who scored three goals 
and had one assist. 

UCSD started the game by 
playing very aggressively, forcing 
constant pressure on the Scot 
defense. Junior mid fielder Scott 
Goodman scored the first goal at 
3: 17 into play when he beat a Scot 
defender one-on-one with the 
assist from Rommel. 

Rommel , who wa~ everywhere 
this weekend, went on to score the 
next two goals. The first goal

appear to be a major factor in the 
game, except on a few occasions 
when orne players outswam the 
Tritons. scoring open goals on 
Franke. 

"Even though we los t," Calder 
sa id , "this game gives us a lot of 
co nfidence and we leave here on a 
high note." Brown concurred, 
pointing out that the game gives 
the Tritons a lot of confidence 
going into Colorado Springs. 
Harper's team, not likely to re-
ceive a Regional bid, will settle for 
the Western Water Polo Associa-
tion (WWPA) Championships, 

came at 7:53, after Rommel 
received a pass from Nguyen in 
front of the goal and proceeded to 
kick the ball into the Scot net . 
Rommel's next score came at 
18:24 after he received a long pass 
from senior Scott Hyver and bril-
liantly angled the ball past 
Scot goalie Pat Tinklenberg. 

Macalester had quite a hard 
time generating any offense in the 
first half, managing just one shot 
on goal. 

The Tritons closed out the scor-
ing in the half with goals from 
senior Scott Weisenberg at 28:35 
and from Rommel at 40:30. In all , 

Talk about manual labor. The only 
thing more complicated than most word 
processors is their instruction manuals. 

You can wade through hundreds of 
pages of "user interfaces" and "output 
fonts" or try something far simpler: The

which will take place next week-
end in Colorado Springs. 

Had the Tritons cashed in on a 
few more opportunities they could 
have pulled off a major upset 
despite the officiating. 

However, missed shots and 
poor passing, primarily in the 
second half, extinguished the only 
chance UCSD had in overtaking 
the Bruins. 

The Tritons will head into the 
WWPA Championships as the num-
ber one seed in Division III , and if 
they play anywhere near to the 
caliber of this weekend, they very 
well could live up to that top 
seeding. 

UCSD took 13 shots on goal in 
the first half as their offense per-
formed incredibly. 

Heading into the second half, 
Macalester showed a more ag-
gressive style of play which slowed 
the Triton offense. Yet UCSD 
still managed to score its sixth 
goal on forward Chris Hanssen's 
header at 81 :25. Mark Melnik 
provided the assist. 

Triton goalie Greg Stadler tried 
to save the shutout by deflecting a 
shot from Roger Bridge, but the 
ball still managed to find the back 
of the net , concluding the scori ng 
at 6-1.

Thl marked the exit of tani-
laus goalie chneider. 

"I saw Mike [Bradley] on the 
right side and called for the ball 
- one defender lid by and the 
ball just careened off my foot," 
Brewster recalled. 

Cal State tanislaus forward 
Jose Ramos- astaneda finished 
off the fir t half coring by putting 
the Warriors on the board with a 
penalty kick. 

The only goal of the second 
half for the Tritons was scored by 
Rommel with the most bizarre 
goal of the day. 

"Carrick [Brewster] flicked it 
up, then Thien [ yuyen] flicked it 
again," Rommel recalled. "I just 
ran through, caught the goalie in 
no man's land , and chipped it 
through . I don't think the ball 
ever touched the ground before I 
got to it." 

A little later, Ramo -Castaneda 
notched his second goal of the 
afternoon, again converting on a 
penalty kick to frame the final at 
4-2. 

In reference to the Tritons' 
quick start, Head Coach Derek 
Arm trong sa id, "We did exactly 
what we wanted to in the impor-
tant periods. We wanted to nul-
lify their forwards and midfielder , 
and when we did , we were suc-
cessful. .. 

Cal State Stanislaus Head 
Coach AI T acle reflected, "We 
wanted to hold off their initial 
assault. I thought if we got 
through the fir t 15 to 20 minutes 
it could go either way. As it 
turned out. we settled down , but 
we got off to a bad start." 

On his decision to start Schnei-
der over Jose Briones, who played 
in relief at the goalie position, 
Tsac\e mentioned that he'd " ... 
been rotating [my] goalies all ea-
son. It was Schneider'S turn. He 
had a bad day." 

In reference to the Triton, 
Tsacle said that "San Diego has a 
strong team. I told my players it 
would be the I ational Champion-
ship game today. I think UCSD 
will win it all ." 

Rommel , dubbed Mr. No-
vember by teammates, summed 
up the attitude of the entire team 
when he said " We just .overpow-
ered them today. We closed down 
and had hard tackling. We're con-
fident and on a roll ." 

The victory over Macalester 
the previous day wa not nearly as 
close as the regional champion-
ship against Stanislaus. With two 
minutes left to play, a fog rolled 
onto the field signaling the end of 
the game. The outcome, however, 
had already been determined by 
halftime as the Tritons built up a 
5-0 lead on their way to a 6-1 
crushing of the Macalester Col-
lege Scots.

The Tritons concluded 
regular season play Friday 
night when they overcame a 
two game deficit 10 defeat 
Cal State Los Angeles 14-

New Zealand may not 
know much about football, 
but on Saturday night it 
proved to the Tritons that it 
knows plenty about rugby 
- especially bow to play it 
- as the New Zealand AII-
Stars defeated UCSD 22-0 
on Muir Field. 

The Tritons were thor-
oughly dominated by the 
more experienced New Zea-
landers, who wonjust about 
every scrum and consistent-
ly had the ball down on 

UCSO's side of the field. 
Still, this was an exhibition 
game for both squads, and 
the Tritons wiD face competi-
tion closer to their own level 
when the regular season 
bqins.

PHIL'S ANALYSIS ... I could go on about how 
the Browns are 10-4 on Monday nights, have won 
their last four Monday night contests, and have 
beaten the Oilers four in a row at the Astrodome 
(where the game is being played), but it's not really 
worth it. ] n order to analyze this game from its proper 
perspective, it is important to understand this one 
vital fact: Houston sucks. Even without Kosar, Cleve-
land could probably win this game with its collective 
eyes closed. When was the last time the Oilers have 
been a serious contender (the fact that they made it to 
the Wildcard game last year was only because the 
AFC was so weak)? Exactly. [ don't think you can 
remember. I still can't believe they made this an even 
spread . If the gamblers in Vegas could read by picks, 
they'd be making millions. I think it's pretty clear that 
Phil recommends that you ...

Men's Soccer Advances to Quarterfinals 

Rommel Scores Five to Lead UCSD to Weekend Sweep 
By JAMES M. BURKE 

and JONCARLO MARK 
Staff Writers 

General Rommel led the blitz-
krieg that drove the German army 
through Africa in World War II. 
Junior Forward Scott Rommel 
provided that same leadership 
Saturday and Sunday scoring five 
goals over the span of the two 
days and catapulting UCSD into 
the NCAA Division 111 quarter-
finals. The Tritons combined a 4-
2 victory over the Cal State Stani-
laus Warriors Sunday with a 6-1 

win over the Macalester College 
Scots to earn the right to advance. 

UCSD will play Emory Col-
lege of Atlanta in next weekend's 
quarterfinal , but the location 
and time will not be announced 
until later today. Emory (14-4-3), 
ranked 24th in the tournament 
and fourth in it four-team 
bracket, pulled major upsets over 
both Bethany of West Virginia 
and North Carolina We layan. 

The Triton blitzkreig virtually 

ended the Sunday game against 
CSU Stanislaus before it starteJ , 
scoring three goals within the first 
10 minutes. 

Scarcel four and one-half 
minutes into the game, mid fielder 
Mike Kappes slid a pass just in 
front of a Warrior defender to 
Thien Nguyen, who banged one 
home from 10 yards out on the 
rights side of the goal to give 
UCSD a 1-0 advantage. 

With the net just recovering 
from the impact of the first goal, 
Nguyen, who led UCSD in assists 
during the regular eason, struck 
again. He broke away down the 
left sideline and passed to Rom-
mel who promptly rolled the ball 
past Stanislaus goalie Jack 
Schneider for a 2-0 lead . 

"I just wanted to penetrate and 
go through players. The defense 
wasn't that much of a problem 
today," Nguyen commented later. 

Carrick Brewster capped the 
Triton scoring blitz, taking a pass 
from Mike Bradley, dribbling past 
one defender, and striking gold at 
the I 0:02 mark of the first half.

Women's Soccer Dominates in 
Minnesota; A dvances to Nationals 

By A. C. LEE 
Staff Wrirer 

There's a saying that neither rain, sleet, nor snow can stop a 
mailman from delivering the mail. That also seems to be the ca e 
forthe UCS D women 's soccerteam, as it won both of its NCAA 
Division III Regional games in four inches of snow and below 
freezing temperatures in St. Paul, Minnesota this weekend. 

Since the postman always rings twice, the Tritons came off a 
Saturday win against St. Thomas college with a 2-0 victory over 
Cortland State which gave them the West Region Championship 
Title . 
. Felicia Faro scored the first goal on an assist by Kalyn Shea 

early on, and Toni Krumme ~cored UCSD's second goal on a 
35-yard free kick 28 minutes into the game. In addition, the 
Tritons outshot Cortland State 14-6 and extended their shutout 
record to seventeen games. 

The top-seeded Tritons (19-0-2) will now advance to the 
NCAA Division III National Tournament and play Ithaca, New 
York, at the home field of William Smith College in Geneva, 
New York. The other game pits William Smith and Methodist of 
North Carolina. 

Saturday, UCSD got a taste of sweet revenge when it defeated 
S1. Thomas College 3-0. Last year, St. Thomas upset the Tritons 
1-0 and consequently knocked them out of tournament play. 

Krumme, who had not scored at all during the regular season, 
scored twice Saturday on assists from Heather Mauro and Faro. 

Katy Dulock added to her Triton record when she scored her 
21 st goal of the eason. 

Tempers Erupt at TKE-
Phi Delt Volleyball Final 
By PHIL GRUEN 
Sporrs Editor 

Friday night's IFC Volleybal1 
final between the fraternities Tau 
Kappa Epsilon and Phi Delta 
Theta was cancelled when a scuf-
fle broke out in the stands during 
the second game at the Triton 
Pavilion. At the time of the ruckus, 
the TKE's held a 1-0 advantage in 
the set and were winning the 
second game by a 6-0 score. 

According to one spoke per-
son, there were no punches thrown 
but the commotion in itself inev-
itably caused the officials to can-
cel the match . At pre time, the 
rea on for the scuffle and who 

may have ini tiated it were till 
under inve ti~ation. 

Further commotion occurred 
when TKE member Matt Ran-
dolph accidentally smashed hi 
head into one of the glass doors at 
the entrance to the gym, shatter-
ing the gla s and drawing a great 
deal of attention. This occurrence, 
however, was not known to have 
any direct relation to the fuss 
inside. 

The TKE's had reached the 
finals by defeating each of Sigma 
Alpha Mu, Delta Sigma Phi, and 
Sigma Pi handily, while the Phi 
Delts t~uggled somewhat but 
neverthele;)~ overcame both igma 
Al ;Jna Ep ilon and Pi Kappa Phi 
to earn the right to the final. The 
Phi Delt received a b 'e in round 
one due to their o'verali I foC "ports 
champIOnshIp last year. 

Coach Derek Arm-
strong tried to ex-
plain to his star for-
ward that he should 
let others score 
(right) ... but Scott 
Rommel would not 
listen, as his five 
goals over the week-
end would attest (be-
row).

Tritons Perform Well in 10-6 loss 

UCLA Too Much for Tritons 
By DAVID POTICHA 
ContribUTing Writer 

The 2nd-ranked UCLA Bruins 
men's water polo team came to 
UCSD expecting to dominate and 
eventually crush the 8th-ranked 
Tritons. UCLA, coming off a 
huge loss to Cal the night before, 
was ranked second for the first 
time in months. The Bruins were 
heavily favored , but someone 
forgot to mention that to the 
Tritons. 

Junior David Calder called it 
the "best game we've played all 
year," as the Tritons stayed close 
the entire game, finally conceding 
to UCLA by a 10-6 score. 

Coach Denny Harper also 

thought the Tritons played fan-
tastically but he was furious about 
what he termed "the worst offi-
ciated game I've ever seen." Ac-
cording to Harper, the referee on 
one side of the pool "consistently 
favored UCLA." 

Harper said he could see that 
UCLA was controlling the 
game for the most part, but that 
"every time we even had a chance 
to put ourselves into a position to 
win, the official made a poor 
call." The official was allowing a 
lot of "underwater hacking" ac-
cording to Calder, and Harper 
said that this official will "never 
work a Tritons game again, 
period." 

The I 0-6 score does not justify 
the actual closeness of the game. 
The Tritons had plenty of scoring 

opportunities, but some of their 
shots just refused to fall. 

Despite the circumstances, 
Harper thought his squad "ad-
apted great to the officiating." 
Most notably so was sophomore 
Jason "Turtle" Brown. According 
to Turtle, his job going into the 
game was to "get a lot of kick-
outs and fouls, but not to take a 
lot of shots. " However, the referee 
refused to call the obvious fouls, 
and Brown was continually 
mugged in front ofthe goal. There-
fore, he simply shot the ball when 
he got it toward the end of the 
game, scoring two nifty scoop 
shots that the Bruin goalie never 
even reacted to. 

The scorins for the Tritons was 
divided evenly between Brown,
