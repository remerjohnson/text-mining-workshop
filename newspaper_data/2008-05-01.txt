UCSD admitted its largest-ever 
incoming freshman class this year, but 
maintaining a racially diverse student 
population remains a critical challenge.

This year’s group of admitted appli-
cants saw an 11-percent increase in 
Latino students from 2007, but a 9-
percent decrease in black students and 
a 22-percent decrease in American 
Indian students since last year.

Assistant Vice Chancellor of 
Admissions and Relations with Schools 
Mae W. Brown said the 1996 passage 
of Proposition 209  — which prohibits 
public institutions from using race, sex 
or ethnicity as factors for admission 
— introduced a challenge that the uni-
versity continues to face.

“Generally speaking, we continue to 
admit a broadly diverse class,” Brown 
said in an e-mail. “However, since the 

adoption of Proposition 209, we have 
struggled to maintain diversity for his-
torically underrepresented students.”

Since taking office in 2004, 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox said she 
has made student diversity one of her 
top priorities.

“I’m not satisfied with where we are, 
but we sure are trying hard,” Fox said. 
“I would like to get to the place where 
UCSD looks like the rest of California.”

Fox noted that UCSD has seen 
a steady increase among Latino stu-
dents in the last few years, but she

Despite having allegedly dropped 
out of the A.S. senatorial race sev-
eral weeks before last month’s cam-
puswide election, a Student Voice! 
candidate has 
chosen to accept 
his victory as 
one of the eight 
A.S. all-campus 
senators.

T h u r g o o d 
Marshall College 
s o p h o m o r e 
David Henry 
Ritcherson, who 
claimed to have 
withdrawn from 
the election approximately two weeks 
after he submitted an application to 
run for office, discovered his unex-
pected win when he attended the 
election announcements April 11. 
Although Ritcherson said he was 
unsure about his next move at the 
time, he has since informed A.S. 
councilmembers of his decision to 
accept the senatorial seat. 

 “I do not want to pass up this 
great opportunity to do great things 
for this university,” Ritcherson said 
in an e-mail.

Ritcherson said he never 
spoke directly to A.S. Elections 
Manager Tanya Piyaratanaphipat 
about his decision to drop out of 
the race, but that he had e-mailed 
Piyaratanaphipat a letter of with-
drawal. Ritcherson said that techni-

should ensure that they receive 
confirmation of their withdrawal 
requests.

A.S. President-elect Donna Bean 
stated in a previous interview that 
she had sent correspondences to 
elections officials, and that she told 
the Guardian that Ritcherson had 
withdrawn from the race at the end 
of last month. 

Bean also added that a “thorough 
investigation of the circumstances is 
in order,” but neither Ritcherson nor 
Piyaratanaphipat was contacted for 
such an investigation. Bean could not 
be reached for further comment. 

Despite the mistake, Ritcherson 
said he is eager to work with the 
council as an all-campus senator.

“I dropped out at first because 
I was thinking about other obliga-
tions to campus organizations aside 
from student government, classes and 
things like that,” he said. “But after 
the results were released and I took 
time to think on it, I found that I had 
so much peer support.  It was really 
the influence of SV! peers and friends 
that was the deciding factor for me to 
accept the win.

Murillo also remains optimistic 
about Ritcherson’s decision. 

“I have spoken to Ritcherson and 
we both feel that he is capable of 
handling the responsibilities that 
come with this position,” Murillo 
said. “I don’t think this will be a 
problem at all.”

Yeung at kauyeung@ucsd.edu.

cal difficulties most likely prevented 
Piyaratanaphipat from receiving the 
e-mail.

Piyaratanaphipat said she only 
learned of Ritcherson’s decision to 
drop out of the race on election 
day. 

“None of the A.S. election officials 
or managers received any informa-
tion from SV! or Ritcherson about 
his withdrawal,” Piyaratanaphipat 
said. “If I had prior notice, I would’ve 
removed him from the ballot along 
with the other five candidates who 
opted to drop out of the race.” 

A.S. President Marco Murillo 
confirmed that no A.S. official 
received information regarding 
Ritcherson’s request of withdrawal 
before the election. 

“I did not hear anything about 
Ritcherson’s wish to drop out and, 
to my belief, no one contacted  
[Piyaratanaphipat] about it either,” 
Murillo said.

Piyaratanaphipat said that while 
miscommunication played a part in 
the mix-up, the mistake should not 
be linked to the A.S. Council.

“The candidates who went 
through the simple and appropriate 
measures were all removed from 
the ballot, so the A.S. system works 
perfectly fine,” she said. “I think that 
there was most likely confusion on 
SV!’s behalf.”

While Piyaratanaphipat did not 
comment on Ritcherson’s accep-
tance of the senatorial position, she 
said that candidates who wish to 
drop out from the electoral race 

‘With Tuition and Fees, the 
Closer to Zero the Better’
On April 29, the University 

of California’s recently inducted 
President Mark G. Yudof hosted a 
teleconference with college newspa-
per editors from the University of 
California, speaking on topics ranging 
from diversity to the budget crisis.

Editors: How do you see 
yourself furthering the UC Office 
of the President restructuring 
efforts in the years to come? 

Yudof: I absolutely praise those 
efforts. I think there are some 
things we do at the system level 
that we shouldn’t be doing at all. 
I ask myself, “Do we add value to 
what the campuses are doing or is it 
something they can handle on their 
own?” If we’re not adding value we 
ought not to be in the business. 

There are things that we do, like 
the centralized processing of appli-
cations for admission. I’m going 
to look at it and make sure we’re 
doing it as efficiently as we can, not 
absorbing costs that we ought not 
to absorb. 

So I’m very much behind it and 
I think I’ll be spending a good part 

of my time in the next year going 
over department by department 
and determining what activities 
we should engage in and which we 
should not and I think we’ll have 
significant cuts in our budget. It 
won’t be cuts in the overall budget, 
it’ll be cuts in the Office of the 
President budget so that the money 
can go to the campuses for things 
like faculty salaries and scholarships 
and rehabilitation of buildings and 

other things that are very much 
needed on campus.

Editors: In the face of state budget 
cuts, how can the university main-
tain its education standards?

Yudof: That’s really my problem 
and the chancellors’ problem. This 
is not a static thing. Somebody says, 
“We’re going to cut your appro-

New Awards to Honor  
Standout Graduates

By Sarah de Crescenzo
Senior Staff Writer

This year’s inaugural All-Campus 
Graduation Celebration on June 19 
will feature a new award recognizing 
two students — one undergraduate 
and one graduate student — who 
have made significant contributions 
to UCSD campus life.

Each Outstanding Senior Award 
recipient will receive $1,000, a 
plaque commemorating individual 
achievements and a lifetime mem-
bership with the UCSD Alumni 
Association, valued at $500. 

In addition, the selected stu-
dents will be publicly recognized at 
this year’s graduation celebration, 
which will feature keynote speaker 
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

The Outstanding Senior Award 
is intended for students who have 
contributed to the campus as a 
whole, rather than solely through 
their specific college. Though each 
college will still hold its own gradu-
ation ceremony, as in past years, 
the all-campus celebration aims to 

bring together graduating seniors as 
an entire university.

“The All-Campus Graduation 
Celebration is not an event meant 
to overtake or replace individual 
college ceremonies in any way,” All-
Campus Graduation Celebration 
Committee Awards and Program 
co-Chair Sarah Chang said. “It’s 
simply an opportunity for graduat-
ing seniors from all across cam-
pus, regardless of college, major or 
student group affiliation, to come 
together to celebrate their careers at 
UCSD. It’s a way to show them how 
much they mean to the university 
and reflect on all they’ve contrib-
uted here.”

While certain awards already 
exist that recognize exceptional 
seniors at their individual com-
mencement ceremonies, there are 
very few awards that highlight grad-
uating students’ campuswide con-
tributions, Chang said.

“The idea behind the All-
Campus Graduation Celebration 
is the celebration of ‘our UCSD,’ 
and this will be the opportunity to 
recognize seniors who have done 
amazing work throughout their 
years here,” committee member 
and Revelle College Senator Darryl 
Nousome said. 

A secondary objective of the 

Two students will 
receive recognition for 
academic performance, 
contributions to campus 
organizations.

POORLY DRAWN LINES  BY REZA FARAZMAND

Yudof  Prepared to Guard 
Higher-Education Funding
▶ YUDOF, from page 1
priations, don’t raise the fees, don’t do 
this, don’t do that.” Then they assume 
everything’s going to be the same, 
that the professor who got an offer to 
go to another institution won’t leave, 
that the class sizes will stay the same, 
that there will be the same number of 
advisers. It’s very hard, particularly 
if you have a growing student body, 
you have inflation, it’s hard just to 
maintain your programs. 

My view is that with tuition and 
fees, the closer to zero the better. The 
taxpayers of the state should provide 
for the higher education of its citizens, 
and I’m going to work very hard to 
achieve that, but I’m apprehensive. We 
can make some cuts as not everywhere 
is absolutely efficient, but at some 
point I’m just desperately afraid that 
we’ll get too close to the bone and that 
the students will be hurt. 

That’s another reason that when-
ever there are discussions of raising 
fees students need to be involved in 
that. They’re not only the people pay-
ing the bills, but they should be able to 
assess what the consequences are for 
various levels of fees and state funding 
for their education on that campus.

Editors: What will you do to 
maintain diversity among UC stu-
dents?

Yudof: My experience has been 
that when all is said and done, very 
active recruitment, getting into the 
high schools, and Folsom scholar-
ship programs are probably the most 
critical things to recruiting under-
represented groups to the university. 

I like to say that being president 
is like being manager of a cemetery: 
There are many people under you 

and no one’s listening. 
We are going to have accountabil-

ity in this system; we are accountable 
for the diversity of the student popu-
lation. I’m going to see assessments 
of what sort of outreach programs 
we have going into the high schools. 
I’m even a believer in outreach into 
the elementary school and pre-K 
years. It’s important that we devote 
enough scholarship money for low-
income people, to help all racial and 
ethnic groups who fall into these 
low-income categories.

Editors: Given decreases in fed-
eral and state funding, what will 
you do to make sure that the UC 
isn’t headed toward privatization? 

Yudof: There is a trajectory 
of increases in Pell Grants, which 
would make higher education more 
affordable, at least for families in 
the $40,000 to $45,000 range. There 
are also a number of proposals for 
tax credits and tax deductions at the 
federal level. 

I’m very worried about the stu-
dent loan situation. I don’t have a sil-
ver bullet for you. I really wish I did. 
I think we’re really in a squeeze. My 
bet is that over the next year you’ll see 
more rather than less federal money 
going in. 

I think we need to work hard 
to reverse the trends of the state. 
California’s not much different from 
Pennsylvania and Texas and Michigan 
and Florida. That is, the expenditures 
per student with inflation adjustment 
have been going down for the past 
five to 10 years. All I can say is that we 
need to do a better job of persuading 
the legislatures of the value of higher 
education.

Council Hears Suggestion of 
Quarterly Fee Increase Referendum

Last night’s A.S. Council meet-ing contained the portents of a fee referendum next fall and 
a debate about the lackluster num-
ber of independent candidates in this 
quarter’s elections.

Representatives from UCSD’s 
Student Promoted Access Center for 
Education and Service first made a 
presentation during public input about 
what S.P.A.C.E.S. accomplished during 
its first year in operation.

The speakers touched on their use 
of campus tours and off-site outreach 
programs to promote the advantages 
of a UCSD degree to students at high 
schools with below-average test scores.

They also 
stressed the inpor-
tance of encourag-
ing black students 
to enroll here 
because the lack of 
diversity may lead 
them to choose 
other universities.

After hearing about plans to expand 
the center’s efforts from regional to 
statewide,  the council changed gears 
and entertained a presentation about 
the need for a fee referendum.

The Task Force on Referenda, which 
is composed entirely of councilmem-
bers, investigated the council’s need for 
more funding. 

The growing number of student 
organization funding requests and an 
increasing programming budget for the 
Sun God Festival, Bear Gardens and 
other events posed the biggest chal-
lenges.

After walking the council through 
its number-crunching, the task force 
presented an informal recommenda-
tion of a quarterly fee increase of $9.60.

Task force members also recom-
mended that the amount of the fee be 
linked to the inflation rate and that a 
special election be held next fall so that 

the new revenue can be brought in as 
soon as possible.

“Within the next five years, we can’t 
sustain on what we’re getting right now,” 
task force member and Vice President 
of Finance and Resources Sarah Chang 
said.

Although the presentation indi-
cated a clear need for new funding 
to maintain the council’s current level 
of programs and services, a definitive 
decision on a referendum will be left to 
the next council, which will take office 
on May 9. 

Councilmembers also considered 
changes to election rules that were 
drafted to address the meager candi-

date turnout of this 
year’s election. 

The council 
was supportive of 
an amendment to 
allow campaign-
ing to start during 
the eighth week 
of Winter Quarter 

instead of the first week of Spring 
Quarter but debated the necessity of 
attempting to rein in slate politics.

John Muir College Senator Christine 
Chang sponsored an amendment that 
would limit slates to eight candidates so 
that independent candidates — armed 
with their extended campaigning time 
— wouldn’t be overwhelmed by the 
coordinated publicity power of slates 
with upwards of 20 candidates.

Councilmembers criticized the 
proposal for encroaching on students’ 
rights to organize and the difficulty of 
imposing such a rule.

“How fascist are we going to get 
to help independents?”Earl Warren 
College Senator Peter Benesch asked.

The discussion focused on the need 
to educate students about the impor-
tance of running for the council and 
the details of the election process before 
the proposal was voted down.

said she hopes to increase the num-
ber of black students on campus. 
She explained that enrollment figures 
are complicated by the fact that stu-
dents are increasingly opting not to 
self-identify themselves racially. The 
number of applicants who declined 
to state their race rose by 12.3 percent 
this year.

In pursuit of diversity, UCSD 
sponsors outreach programs in com-
munities throughout California and 
offers financial aid packages to under-
represented students to attract them 
to UCSD. Fox visits high schools 
throughout the year to speak to stu-
dents and encourage them to con-
sider the opportunities college offers, 
and also hosts a college fair.

“My belief is that we do not yet have 
a level playing field in high schools … 
so that’s why we have to work with the 
high schools,” Fox said.

Universitywide, 60,008 California 
high school seniors were offered 
admission, representing a 4.7-percent 
increase since last year. However, the 
university’s percentage of admitted 
students declined from 77.4 percent 
of applicants to 75.3 percent due to 
the growing number of applicants.

The systemwide total of admitted 
Latino students rose by 16 percent, 
black students by 11.3 percent, white 
students by 1.2 percent and Asian-
American students by 0.7 percent 
compared to 2007. American Indians 
represented the only decline, with 
11 fewer students admitted. The UC 
system admitted 7,545 international 
students, compared to 6,283 last year. 
Data for transfer students is not yet 
available.

commencement; it will have to some-
how substitute or overthrow what 
we currently practice. To fully culti-
vate all-Triton unions, Senior Week 
will have to be the core end-of-your-
career activity. Several obstacles will 
already hinder the latter this year, but 
one looms large: A bulk of seniors, 

event, Nousome said, is to create a 
closer relationship between under-
graduate and graduate students.

“Another goal that the commit-
tee felt was important was bridging 
the gap between undergraduate and 
graduate/professional students,” he 
said. “These award opportunities will 
recognize students from both parts of 
UCSD at one event.”

Chang said the idea for the 
Outstanding Senior Award has been 
circulating for over a year, when 
former Eleanor Roosevelt College 
Senior Senator Erik Rodriguez-
Palacios and former Earl Warren 
College Senior Senator Michelle 
Yetter introduced it, but it did not 
come to fruition until members of 
this year’s graduating class vowed 
to organize a committee that would 
actualize it.

“Unfortunately, it didn’t happen 

last year, but we’ve been lucky enough 
to have the support this year to make 
it work,” Yetter said. “We thought the 
idea for an award would be a really 

great way to honor a special student, 
so we stuck with it.”

Selection criteria include high 
academic achievement and leader-

ship through participation in stu-
dent organizations, but Chang said 
that the main consideration will be 
how the student has contributed to 
the betterment of the university and 
campus life. 

“This award will recognize a 
graduating senior that has not only 
achieved great marks in the class-
room, but contributed time, effort 
and creativity in enriching campus 
life,” she said.

All graduating seniors and gradu-
ate students are eligible to win the 
awards. Individuals may nominate 
up to three students, and each nomi-
nation must include the signatures 
of three endorsers from the UCSD 
community, which includes students, 
faculty, staff and alumni. The nomi-
nation deadline is May 9.

its end. As if there weren’t enough of 
those around anyway. 

And I’m half-expecting a driver to 
reassure our weary commuting experi-
ences by replying, “Don’t worry, I’m a 
shuttle bus driver.” 

Riding the Shuttle Bus With My Potholes and Doggy Bags
Navigation around UCSD via the shuttle system isn’t quite what it used to be. Sure, the 
lack of uniform driving ability has 
always been always present for me, and 
the all-too-common encounter with a 
ruddy pothole makes for a displeasing 
route. Yet back in their heyday, shuttle 
rides were a calming experience meant 
to steer you gently into your day. Not 
anymore.

On one pleasant last month, morn-
ing I started my day as I usually do. 
I weaved through traffic in Del Mar, 
accelerated and stopped almost simul-
taneously and tried to decipher wheth-
er I knew the people in the cars next 
to me. I’m always happy when I finally 
park my car because I can stretch my 
joints and board the shuttle where 
I observe the morning around me. 

Nearing campus, I got in touch 
with both the window and the shoul-
der of a woman sitting beside me, not 
of my own fault, but due to the tight 
maneuvers that our captain was pursu-
ing. But I felt as if our driver was, to a 
degree, having some fun so I let him go 
at it. Perhaps it was the charged music 
on Sophie@103.7, or maybe he really 
did hold the belief that our box on 
four wheels could surpass its physics-
related inhibitions.

One does not know the impact 
that a tiny crater might have upon an 
individual until that person utilizes the 
shuttle system. For it is only when one 
opts to sit on a bus’ dilapidated benches 
while riding through the holes and 
uneven pavement that one can discover 
why these roadways need to be resur-
faced. Because when you hit a pothole 

However, recently I’ve noticed that I 
can’t get to campus without an event 
occurring.

One morning, I watched indifferent-
ly as the shuttle bus slowly approached. 
Actually, slowly isn’t even the apt word 
for its sluggishly drawn-out process. It 
was more like, “I watched a corpulent 
box on four wheels meekly rendezvous 
with its intended destination.”

As the bus pulled up, it came close 
to the point that the machine’s side 
mirror thought it human enough to 
come dangerously close to contact 
with early-morning bystanders. As the 
door opened, however, I did notice 
that there was a partially illegible sticky 
note that read “please watch your st,” 
so I thought, whew, at least we can 
be sure Blue Bird Bus Company is on 
our side.

while riding in a UCSD shuttle bus, 
you essentially know that it’s a pothole 
that you hit. There really is no other 
explanation as to why the decibel level 
suddenly peaked to 120 or to why you 
feel like you need a doggy bag because 
the Cheerios in your stomach said hi.

To be sure, there have been numer-
ous instances where shuttle rides were 
indeed quite serene experiences. When 
I first got to UCSD, I liked to meet new 
Tritons on the bus, to get a daily tour 
of campus without walking anywhere 
and to get the chance to glance over the
Guardian to get a sense of the goings 
on around campus.

Yet gradually, the waiting times 
seemed to get longer, the weather 
seemed to get warmer and the people 
seemed to get more boring. What’s 
more, the shuttle drivers began to drive 

Aren’t Texans and Californians supposed to mix badly? In one hand, you have the 
heated state of conventions and 
traditionalists, one that hearkens 
America’s classic cowboy flavor 
of the strong, silent types that get 
the ranch built, then maintain its 
spartan cleanliness over a lifetime. 
Then you have on the other hand 
the freeform breeze of California, 
where mayors can turn against the 
entire nation on the issue of gay 
marriage (see: San Francisco) or 
break up longtime marriages (see: 
Los Angeles and San Francisco).

When Mark G. Yudof brings 
those typified Texan traits to his new 
post as president of the University of 
California, the mix is an energiz-
ing amalgamated dose. In a recent 
sitdown conference call with college 
newspaper editors, Yudof exuded 
both somber realism and calculated 
drive, a rare combination to see for 
a state full of students jaded by bro-
ken promises and ballooning costs.

Yudof ’s most impressively upstand-
ing comments were his positions on 
students themselves. He rightly casts 
the university’s largest population 
as customers, a caste that needs to 
be pleased and not run under with 
exorbitant fees and rising tuition. In 
this light, Yudof frankly addressed the 

shrinking state budget as a frightening-
ly sizeable shortcoming, but affirmed 
the need to steer any budget impacts 
away from the students themselves. 
This is a crucial mindset, especially 
in this time of financial fat-cutting. It 
keeps a core question at the forefront: 
If this program is lost in the name of 
the budget, how will it affect the stu-
dent? This barometer will prove vital to 
preserving the university’s progressive 
atmosphere.

But Yudof also knows the prob-
lem’s gravity. Describing himself as 
“apprehensive” about the state’s finan-
cial future, the new executive also 
stood by the university’s need to 
not approach budget-saving with a 
cut-to-the-bone attitude. Instead, he 
intends to focus attention on the state 
Legislature, adhering to every student 
activist’s dream: financial burdens 
should be weighed on politicians and 
not students. Yudof even went further 
to fortify his support of students, say-
ing that “for tuiton and fees, the closer 
to zero the better.” It’s a grand goal, one 
that no doubt might be said to build 
support more than set a long-term 
ambition. But Yudof ’s extensive and 
unorthodox experience with legisla-
tors backs the belief that this president 
may actually achieve a better financial 
picture for students. Yudof not only 
faced off against Texas politicians over 

student fees, but took the state to court 
over issues of affirmative action and 
enrollment diversity. Applying that 
hard-nosed Texan mentality to the 
languishing UC system might be the 
exact jumpstart it needs.

Granted, it’s difficult to fully 
swallow Yudof ’s attractive sound-
bytes about fiscal responsibility and 
dedication to preserving the stu-
dents’ wallets; here’s a man that is 
paid over $800,000 in perks and 
payment packages. But barring a 
complete turnaround, Yudof has said 
exactly the right things to please his 
customers.

After a week of mulling over what was perhaps this year’s oddest student government 
blunder, Student Voice! candidate 
David Henry Ritcherson moved to 
wipe the soiled slate clean by accept-
ing his position as all-campus sena-
tor. But no amount of moving on 
can cleanse what will be an offcenter 
start to the tenure of the SV!-domi-
nated council.

Flashback to weeks ago: Waiting 
for the announcement of elections 
results, there was an air of mock-
ing among the massive SV! crowd, 
many of whom were shoo-ins for 
uncontested races. The predict-
ability made an event usually rife 
with suspense and tension comically 
deflated. 

The surprise became suddenly 
palpable as the elections team began 
running down the list of senato-
rial winners. Conspicuously near 
the top was Ritcherson, with the 
second highest number of votes 
for senatorial contenders. The 
catch: Ritcherson had pulled out 
of the race weeks before. Elections 
Manager Tanya Piyaratanaphipat 

declared his resignation unofficial, 
leaving Ritcherson with a dilemma: 
answer the call of students or pursue 
his original plans.

Picking the former was an hon-
orable, admirable move, but cir-
cumstances drag down the decision. 
Ritcherson’s original reluctance 
about accepting the position — and 
his initial decision to bow out of the 
race — should make any constituent 
rightly wary of his motivation and 
enthusiasm. Piled upon that, this 
year’s councilmembers were beset 
by those exact problems: a lack of 
fervor, camaraderie and basic par-
ticipation in student government. It 
would be easy to peg Ritcherson as 
part of this crowd, considering he 
was a man who didn’t even want the 
job in the first place.

But does a politician have to 
want the job to do well at it? In 
reality, much of senatorial work 
makes use of external knowl-
edge and campus connections, 
and Ritcherson is well-versed in 
both. As a member of some of 
the most underrepresented student 
organizations on campus, includ-

ing the A.S. External office and 
Black Student Union, he pitches in 
an underrecognized but still vital 
share of experience to the council’s 
senatorial caste. 

Ritcherson, like other senators, 
now faces the colossal task of par-
laying individual connections into 
benefits for students — it’s not as 
easy as it looks. Nudging a talk 
with an administrator into stages 

of action takes much more than 
delicate manuvering. It takes bare-
faced dedication and even some 
gall.

It would be unfair to pin problems 
of nonparticipation on Ritcherson 
alone. But his wavy path toward 
accepting his position marks a need 
for the council to push its members 
even harder to represent and fight 
for students.

ON CAMPUS — As an overly reflec-
tive mindset, I find the dead week 
before graduation to be a thorny 
inconvenience. Aside from a part-
time job, June 13 through June 20 
will undoubtedly entail me stewing 
on a four-year career and scrambling 
to find life’s post-college guiding light 
like so many other seniors. How fit-
ting, then, that Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Penny Rue, a staunch 
advocate of mental health and well-
being, is offering a weeklong tasting 
menu of local sites and attractions.

Forget celebrating the culmina-
tion of four hard-fought years with 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox and Rue. 
Share it with Jake Peavy and Khalil 
Greene of the Padres or Bai Yun and 
Gao Gao, the San Diego Zoo’s famous 
panda pair. 

Senior Week is one cog in the 
huge Triton wheel, set to steamroll 
traditional six-college divisions and 
pave the way for more all-campus 
traditions. The new Sun God Festival, 
all-campus graduation and numerous 
other activities illustrate a sea-change 
movement toward establishing an all-
campus community. But seeing as 
this is UCSD’s first stab in recent 
memory at bonding some 20,000
undergraduates, six colleges and five 
academic divisions, the question still 
hangs heavy: How effective will the 
inaugural Senior Week be at cement-
ing an all-campus atmosphere?

There is no doubt that the week is 
aimed at doing exactly that. Rue, along 
with A.S. councilmembers like Emma 
Sandoe, want students to find common 
ground as Tritons, not Warrenites, 
Muirons or Sixth-ese. Sandoe orga-
nized UCSD’s first all-campus gradua-
tion in over a decade, tapping sustain-
ability activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 
to speak on what Sandoe proclaimed 
to be an encompassing topic that the 
“campus community and especially 
seniors care about.”

In all likelihood, Rue and Sandoe 
will be throwing pebbles into the 
sea. An all-campus atmosphere can-
not be maintained as an add-on or 
luxury item to our current six-college 
makeup. To reach the pinnacle of 
UCSD unity, the all-campus gradua-
tion will have to be the main site of

BETWEEN A MAN AND HIS MACHINE

MARVEL’S MAN OF STEEL

KEEPS DRAMA ON TARGET

By Edwin Gonzalez
Staff Writer

Two decades after the collapse of Italy’s fascist regime, progress has shrunk into nonexistence and once again revolutionary politics are beginning to attract the 
inspiration of a new generation. “My 
Brother is an Only Child,” a new 
film directed by Daniele Luchetti, 
follows two adolescent brothers as 
they mature in their relationships, 
ideologies and fractious fraternity 
while contending with the dialecti-
cal views of the other.

Living in the provincial enclave 
of Latina, the ’60s and ’70s have 
accomplished little in reconstructing 
the country’s worn-down towns and collecting its dis-
persed nationalism. The eldest brother, Manrico (Riccardo 
Scamarcio), becomes the voice of change early on when he 
allies himself with Italy’s emergent communist party. 

Coupled with his charismatic personage and ardent 
passion for revolutionary change, Manrico is idolized by 
his younger brother, Accio (Elio Germano). Imitating his 

brother’s fondness for powerful ideas, Accio channels his 
bellicose personality elsewhere into fascism, like so many 
hyper-masculine nationalist thugs before him.

Unique to foreign films, this distinctive brand of 
European sibling rivalry is typified by the biting barbs 
of political manifestos — an interesting contrast to the 

sarcastic flippancy common in the 
American household. Wielding ideo-
logical insults as well as a punch 
or two when words aren’t effective, 
the film moves beyond the squa-
lor as Accio develops an interest in 
his brother’s girlfriend Franscesca 
(Diane Fleri). As the years march on, 
what begins as a family’s disparity 
accelerates into a nation’s contrarian 
paradigm.

Luchetti’s attention to the magnetic attraction between 
revolutionary ideas and the fervor of youth is the film’s 
threading theme. Unlike many directors who were them-
selves the revolutionary youth of Manrico’s generation, 
Luchetti utilizes a slightly more conservative style akin 

the family that revolts together, stays together

rial, but with a modernized setting. Whereas the comic saw 
Stark stranded in the middle of the Vietnam War, the film 
sees Stark stranded in the Middle East. Like the original 
story, Stark is recovered as a prisoner and is saved by Yinsen 
(Shaun Toub), a fellow prisoner who constructs protective 
armor for Stark’s heart. As the story goes, Stark constructs 
the Mark I, the first incarnation of the Iron Man armor, 
escapes from his captors. Upon arriving home, Stark realizes 
the harm his weapons have inflicted upon others and decides 
to rid the world of them. As the film progresses, Stark grows 
from apathetic womanizer to responsible industrialist and 
clumsily finalizes the Mark III Iron Man armor.

If there’s anything the film does wrong, it’s overlooked by 
everything the film does right. Casting Robert Downey Jr. as 
the tragically flawed Stark was nothing short of brilliance. 
Downey’s portrayal is not only accurate but also hysterically 
funny. While Stark was always a cynical character, Downey’s 
portrayal adds a charismatic wit that makes the character 
completely his own. In fact, amid all of Stark’s unbelievable 
characteristics, Downey consistently makes Stark believable, 
making the character’s drastic shift in moral beliefs seem all 
the more likely. Perhaps due in large part to his offscreen per-

I t’s safe to say that today’s filmgoers don’t expect much from Marvel films. “X-Men” and “Spider-Man” are the rare exceptions to the plethora of failed film adaptations of Marvel superheroes. For 
the record, Hollywood has successfully killed the film 
franchises of both “Daredevil” and “Ghost Rider” with 
abysmal casting and laughable plots. Enter “Iron Man,” 
an important and decently popular character in the 
Marvel universe, who has been given the silver screen 
makeover — oh boy.

Thankfully, with a cast of Oscar winners and 
nominees, a competent director and an incredible 
marketing campaign, the movie has all the trappings 
of a sure-fire summer blockbuster. And, for the most 
part, it is.

From the get-go, “Iron Man” is quick to set a humor-
ous but serious tone. As heavy guitar riffs play in the 

b a c k g r o u n d , 
the film opens 
with Tony Stark 
(Robert Downey 
Jr.) — genius bil-
lionaire weapons 
m a n u f a c t u r e r 
and complete 
rock star (is 
there any other 

kind?) — sipping on a glass of whiskey as he casually 
banters with a group of soldiers who are completely 
enamored by him, in an armored car traveling some-
where in the Middle East. 

The car suddenly comes under heavy fire and the 
soldiers introduced not five minutes ago die in several 
explosions. Stark scrambles out of the carrier to find 
shelter, then trails a missile falling from the sky before 
it lands three feet away from him. Before the missile 
goes off, Stark glances at the logo stamped across 
the missile that reads “Stark Industries.” The missile 
explodes, and shrapnel penetrates his Kevlar vest. As 
blood leaks from Stark’s chest, the camera pans out 
and the title flashes across the screen in bold letters. 
And so begins “Iron Man.”

The movie is generally faithful to its source mate-

BETWEEN A MAN AND HIS MACHINE
to modern social realism. If indeed Manrico 
lies at the left end of the spectrum and Accio at 
the right, Luchetti’s artistic style straddles the 
dichotomy in the middle.

Throughout Accio’s political socialization 
he capriciously shifts, desperately using politics 
to shape his identity. Beginning with the inno-
cence of religious fanaticism, when Accio reach-
es puberty and his rebellious years, the ideol-
ogy that best defines him becomes his party of 
choice: fascism. Although the story’s structure 
becomes repetitive, the second half picks up 
as Accio reaches the point of disillusionment: 
“They say you get better with age, but I was just 
aging.” Yet, while one brother struggles to find 
himself in the morass of political doctrine, the 
other characteristically breeds militancy.

Manrico’s predictable development is tailored 
to the costume of the archetypal revolution-
ary. Rather than capitulate to disillusionment 
with his political affiliations, he readjusts his 
ideas by becoming even more radical (shock-
ing) and blending his stagnant diplomacy with 
the immediacy of violence. An obvious foil to 
the film’s protagonist, Manrico’s story becomes 
transparently trite; as Jean-Luc Godard would 
articulate more succinctly after his own involve-
ment with radical politics, “To kill a man for an 
idea, is to kill a man.”

Although the film lacks the artistic exu-
berance of Italian directors such as Bernardo 
Bertolucci (“The Dreamers”) who have dealt 
with similar themes, “My Brother”’s intimate 
framework balances its lack of stylistic origi-
nality, since it’s clearly not promoting a radical 
approach. Far less concerned with new wave 

aesthetics, the portrayal of family relationships 
rescues the picture from arthouse sterility; the 
maturation of its characters is refracted and 
inflected by the family dynamic which simulta-
neously anchors it throughout. Even when the 
story reveals itself as contrived by the end, its 
poignancy is incubated by the focal point of the 
family at its core.

Punctuated by confectionary humor 
throughout, “My Brother is an Only Child” 
never stops following its characters’ thoughts, 
movements and developments — no matter 
how circular they may be. As seen in the tur-
moil of one family, youth is finally restored to 
its proper place — outside the political binaries 
— and within the relationships that bind us.

Counting Crows
■ Saturday Nights & Sunday Mornings
GEFFEN

W hile Adam Duritz may get head from skinny disco girls on a typical Saturday night, his Sunday mornings resound with 
the guitar wailings of Kafkaesque regret. This 
is nothing new from the neurotic Counting 
Crows frontman, who sung about wanting to 
be a “big, big star” on their debut album August 
and Everything After (and he certainly got his 
wish). But if fantasies of celebrity and glory were 
thematic 14 — yeah, 14 — years ago, the Crows’ 
latest croonings on Saturday Nights & Sunday 
Mornings might serve as a score of advice from 
a wiser, post-depression Duritz: Be careful what 
you wish for. 

“Honey, I’m just trying to make some sense/ 
Outta me,” Duritz explains on the lazy country 
ballad, “Los Angeles.” (Are guys with dreads 
allowed to sing country music?) His self-exam-
ining apology characterizes the album’s first half 
 — Saturday nights —which details a vagabond 
quest for sincerity in a superficial ’hood. In this 
conflicted search, Duritz realizes amid motel-
room fucking that he “don’t want to feel dif-
ferent,” but he “don’t want to be insignificant,” 
either. It’s a tightrope desperation communicat-

ed in ragged rock gambols, reminiscent of the 
Crows’ Pearl Jam/R.E.M.-inspired beginnings.

An abrupt transition into the acoustic 
strummings of “Washington Square” marks the 
album’s second chunk — Sunday Mornings. As 
a harmonica tremble-squeaks above Duritz’s 
grit, we are vaguely aware of resolution tak-
ing shape. Whereas the first six tracks ramble 
about the “angel thighs” (on clattering opener 
“1492”), the last are sunny-porch love tunes 
about “angel eyes” (the folky “When I Dream of 
Michelangelo”). Yet somewhere between slow 
jams, his quasi-sensitive act grows wearisome. 
Duritz whines a great deal, but says essentially 
the same thing over and over — we get it, dude, 
you’re sad.

But those diehard fans of Duritz’s complain-
ing — and there are lots out there — will appre-
ciate this reversion to classic Counting Crows 
angst. And who knows? Maybe after another 14 
years of soul searching, he’ll finally make some 
sense outta life.

The Long Blondes
■ Couples
ROUGH TRADE

Y ou know, they’re not actually blonde. Everyone in the Long Blondes is a brunette — and the hoax doesn’t end 
there. The UK group’s sophomore effort, 
Couples, suffers from serious identity theft: 
with exhausted synth beats, average vocals 
and lifeless lyrics, it’s as if someone stole the 
Blondes’ usual pop-punk power and replaced 
it with a sad excuse for new-wave air.

At first glance, the oddly named band 
might seem like an eventual British indie 
sensation a la Keane or the Kaiser Chiefs. 
Lead singer Kate Jackson has a hipster glam, 
Karen O-esque style and keening vocals that 
compliment traditional grrl-rock beats on 
“The Serious Bit.” The finale “I’m Going to 
Hell” is the best of the bunch, reprising the 
anthemy rock sound and tongue-in-cheek 
humor of their first hit single, “Weekend 
Without Makeup.”

Unfortunately, the Blondes fail to ride 

the momentum of their successful debut, 
fizzling out with boring, repetitive rhythms 
and insipid, lukewarm lyrics. The coma-
tose “Century” is a song for the graveyard, 
deadened by unnecessary synth (note: if you 
watch its creepy/artsy music video, the weird-
ness makes the song far more bearable).

Jackson’s whispery, forgettable vocals on 
“Round the Hairpin” and “Nostalgia” are 
only made worse by Dorian Cox’s sleepy, 
wannabe-atmospheric keyboards. And on “I 
Liked the Boys,” you’ll find possibly the most 
mundane lyrics ever: “When I was young, I 
liked the boys/ When I was young, you were 
my boy,” punctuated by a chorus of irritating 
“oohs” and “aahs.” It’s enough to make the 
hardiest indie-snob put on some mainstream 
tunes.

SUB POP

A lthough Animal Collective falls into the noise rock genre as far as musical con-ventions go, Water Curses is far from a 
cacophony — it’s a musical alchemy that con-
fidently contends as one of the best EPs of the 
year. Like Salvador Dali capturing a Freudian 
dreamscape on canvas, Avey Tare, Panda Bear, 
Deakin and Geologist of the Baltimore-raised 
quartet tap into the hauntingly pristine surre-
alism of the subconscious and create magic in 
audio format.

Fortifying the anticipation of the follow-
up to Strawberry Jam, the chaotic beauty and 
psychedelic exuberance of “Street Flash” are as 
delightfully addicting to fans as a showering of 
jellybeans are to sugar fiends in dire need of 
a sweet fix. The collaborative originality and 
ingenuity of the childhood friends are unmis-
takable; their experimental reverb, hummable 
melodies and exotic animal sounds spew forth 
aural pleasure for eager ears all around.

Underlying Animal Collective’s fairly indeci-
pherable vocals are contemplative songwriting 
and buried themes open to interpretation. In 

“Water Curses,” the boys hint at the convergence 
of reality and imagination with “All the things 
that I relate to/ like covers and paintings/ trans-
parent paper greens/ up above me while I sleep/ 
to make the room more natural/ to die in, die in, 
die” and “My mouth is just an ocean of drool/ 
Standing on the bridge I/ wink at you from up 
high/ a talking fish comes as she moves.” The 
only critique arises after the 15-minute melodi-
ous dream spell ends, provoking the same sense 
of forlornness that surfaces as the 25-cent kiddy 
carousel slows to a stop.

Enchanting fans with an amalgamation of 
sound effects fused with transcendental song-
writing, Water Curses’ surrealist nature slips 
languidly into your body like an invigorating 
magic elixir with a twist of a Disneyland electric 
parade. Being of the utmost musical excellence, 
Animal Collective draws upon an otherworldly 
realm of inspiration, taking music to a whole 
new level.

I n the 00s, punk belongs to Los Angeles. No Age perfectly encompasses the myriad of noisy kid-bands populating 
the Smell (downtown L.A.’s finest dive) 
through their own meticulous approach to 
a surface-simple art-punk duo. Dean Spunt 
and Randy Randall, the two heads, pilfer an 
array of favorites from My Bloody Valentine 
to Squeeze to Black Flag, and emerge with 
a tasty skate soundtrack that indulges in 
the finer aspects of shoegaze and ambient. 
Nouns is the house that DIY built.

On first listen, Spunt’s off-key whine in 
“Teen Creeps” may not seem to gel with the 
track’s white wall of fuzz and hard snare 
hits, but it grows into a listening kinship 
normally felt for your cool friends and their 
even cooler older siblings. Nouns’ singles 
are more to-the-point than last year’s vinyl 
comp Weirdo Rippers, and its introspective 
drone segues are more lush and mood-
appropriate. The dudes even try their hands 
at the mellow ballad with “Things I Did 
When I Was Dead,” which might por-

tend more computer-loop chill outs on 
the next record. Moments like “Keechie”’s 
noise blanket periodically cutting out along 
to a clean guitar mantra make you wonder, 
“Where has this band been all my life? I 
want to start one like this!” Cue jittery opti-
mistic dancing with the onrush of “Sleeper 
Hold”’s power chord overthrow.

But oh, the carefree pop is there too! 
“Here Should Be My Home” grabs old boy-
band melodic chops and injects them with 
a detached snarl, a perfect lead-in to the 
hazy chord cycle of “Impossible Bouquet.” 
Nouns’ madness ends in an onrush of 
downstrums, the sampler cued to endless 
shock; “Brain Burner” has the energy of an 
18-year-old outcast in the body of a bald-
ing 7” connoisseur, channeled through a 
bubblegum filter. Fuck Vampire Weekend, 
this is the real youth and worth at least as 
much breath.

(in ARABIC with English subtitles)

sona and history, Downey brings 
an approachability to the character 
that would be left unfulfilled by 
another actor, and it’s largely due 
to Downey that “Iron Man” manag-
es to hold even in its slowest parts.

With Downey redirecting most 
of the attention, it’s easy to over-
look the film’s supporting cast. 
Gwyneth Paltrow accurately por-
trays Pepper Potts as the sassy yet 
loyal assistant, and Jeff Bridges 
perfectly depicts Obadiah Shane as 
both charming and ruthless, even 
managing to steal some scenes 
from Downey. 

The only noticeable sidestep 
seems to be Terrence Howard’s 
portrayal of Col. James Rhodes, 
the straight-edge air enforcement 
colonel better known to fans as 
superhero sidekick War Machine. 
This is no fault of the actor’s but 
rather the character itself, who, 
unfortunately, was never quite 
fleshed out. Considering Howard’s 
reputation, it’s strange that he be 
relegated to such an unremarkable 
role. But due to the frequent hints 
of an inevitable sequel, perhaps 
the character was purposely down-
played, with more for him in later 
chapters. 

One of the fascinating things 
about “Iron Man” is that the story 
always revolves around Stark the 
industrialist, not Stark the super-
hero. As an original story, the film 
does an excellent job allowing the 
characters, especially our protago-
nist, to grow, thanks in large part 
to the direction of Jon Favreau. 

Because of the film’s ability to 
touch upon key aspects of the comic 
and its mythos, it’s evident that 
Favreau clearly understands and 
loves the franchise. Perhaps due to 
his experience with “Swingers” (a 
near character study of bachelors) 
and “Zathura” (a kiddy sci-fi spec-
tacle), the actor-turned-director 
knows how to combine charming 
character interactions with stun-
ning visuals, allowing “Iron Man” 
to stand out among its superhero 
film brethren.

The film is not without some 
inevitable lows. It is peppered with 
atrociously sappy moments, partic-
ularly in Stark’s interactions with 
Potts and Rhodes. At times, the 
pacing is jumpy as well. It gives a 
sense of over-urgency, moving too 
quickly — especially in the begin-
ning — as if there’s too great a need 
to get Stark into his Mark I suit and 
take off.

Moreover, the climactic battle 
seems helplessly tacked on. The 
inclusion of Obadiah Shane made 
it necessary for Iron Man to duke 
it out with the Iron Monger, but at 
this point, it’s just hopelessly over-
drawn and cliche. And considering 
the subject matter, the movie can 
seem absurdly light-hearted.

As fan service, the film is one 
of the best of its kind, constantly 
making references that only the 
most passionate of comic book 
readers would notice. But the film 
has enough spectacular imagery 
and humor that such familiarity 
isn’t necessary. What else are you 
going to watch until “Indiana Jones 
IV,” anyway?

UCSD Baseball Has Four Games Against 
Otters to Pass Seawolves for First in CCAA

ERIK JEPSEN/GUARDIAN FILE
Many Tritons came across home plate in their four-game set  with San Francisco State University, as they outscored the Gators 38-22.

top of the second before pulling ahead with 
three more runs in the third. That was all the 
offense the Tritons would need, as the Gators 
would only add one more run in the bottom of 
the third off sophomore starter Matt Rossman, 
who picked up his ninth win of the season for 
his four innings of work. 

Senior closer Keith Noe worked a perfect 
ninth and picked up his single-season school-
record 13th save.

San Francisco State put up more of a fight in 
the finale, jumping out to a 6-1 lead after a five-
run second inning. 

The Tritons started to close the gap with a run 
in the third and two more in the fourth and then 
took their first lead of the game with three runs in 
the fifth. The 7-6 lead would not last, however, as 
the Gators put up another five-spot in the bottom 
of the fifth and went on to win 11-8.

“It’s all about momentum, you have to carry 
that on towards the postseason,” Noe said. “So 
right now we lost a game against San Francisco, 
which is a disappointment for everybody. But 
you’ve got to move on so we’re moving on to 

Monterey Bay and hoping to play four quality 
games against them and take that right into the 
CCAA Tournament.”

With first-place Sonoma State splitting its 
series with Cal State Stanislaus, UCSD is now 
just one game behind the Seawolves in the 
CCAA standings with just four games left, 
against the CCAA’s second worst team in Cal 
State Monterey Bay, before the conference tour-
nament begins on May 8.

“I think [we’re approaching the Otter series] 
no differently than we ever do against any other 
team,” St. John said. “That’s something that we 
definitely stress on our team: it doesn’t matter if 
we’re playing Sonoma State or Tampa University, 
one of the best teams in the country or we’re 
playing one of the worst teams in the country. 
It still comes down to winning a ballgame and I 
think last week definitely taught us that anybody 
can beat you at anytime. So we definitely stress 
that our opponents are nameless and faceless 
and we just have to go out and play baseball.”

THURSDAY, MAY 1, 2008

BASEBALL — The No. 8 Tritons played their 
final road series of the regular season against 
the California Collegiate Athletic Association’s 
last-place team, the San Francisco State Gators, 
and won the first three games before dropping 
the finale on April 27. With the series win, 
UCSD improves to 39-12 overall and 23-9 in 
conference.

UCSD exploded for 16 runs on 25 hits 
— both season highs — to take the opener 
on April 26 and then swept the next day’s 
doubleheade. But the Gators won 11-8 in the 
finale to avoid the sweep, ending a streak of 12 
consecutive losses to the Tritons and picking 
up only their second CCAA win.

“I think we definitely all expected to sweep 
them; we expect to win every game,” sopho-
more starter Kirby St. John said. “But it’s 
baseball and it happens and sometimes you 
can lose to anyone on any day, especially in 
our conference. They played well that last day 
and we didn’t. It was a little bit embarrassing 
at times for us — we weren’t happy about it 
— but it’s one of those things where you just 
have to accept it and move on and learn from 
it.”

Almost everyone in the UCSD lineup 
played a part in the first game’s offensive 
outburst after being shutout for the first three 
innings. The Triton bats put up one run in the 
fourth, five in the fifth, four in the sixth and 
then three more runs in each of the last two 
innings. 

Freshman leftfielder Evan Kehoe went 6-
for-7 with two runs and an RBI from the third 
spot and junior centerfielder Nick Burke went 

3-for-5 with a team-high four RBIs.
“From a pitcher’s standpoint, it’s definitely 

a plus when you know you’re team can go out 
and [score] on any day,” St. John said. “And 
our offense has done a great job all season 
of putting up runs and there’s definitely been 
times when the offense has picked up the 
pitchers and it’s gone the other way too. But 
going into playoffs, it’s great that they’re hit-
ting well and it’s exciting knowing that that’s 
the case. It definitely helps the pitching staff 
out because it gives us more insurance and 
more confidence.”

The right-handed St. John improved to 
7-0, allowing four runs over 6.1 innings and 
striking out seven Gators. He started strong, 
blanking San Francisco State for six innings, 
but ran into trouble in the seventh. The bot-
tom of the Gator order started off the inning 
with three straight singles off St. John, and an 
RBI groundout, walk and another single led 
Head Coach Dan O’Brien to turn to his bull-
pen. Senior Nick Rodiek relieved St. John and 
allowed a two-run double before striking out 
two Gators to get out of the inning and keep 
the Gators out of reach.

“I’m definitely enjoying the way the sea-
son’s going for me and I’m just happy that 
I’ve been able to put a good season together 
and do well for the team and get some wins. 
I’m just happy that we’re having the season 
that we are and that I’m contributing to it in a 
positive way.”

The Tritons cruised in the second game of 
the series as well, picking up a 9-1 victory in 
the first game of the April 26 doubleheader. 
Freshman starter Guido Knudson went eight 
strong innings, allowing only one run on six 
hits and two walks while whiffing eight. 

Once again, almost the entire Triton offense 
got involved in the scoring, with sophomore 
shortstop Vance Albitz leading the way from 
the leadoff spot with four hits and three RBIs.

San Francisco State took its first lead of the 
series with two runs in the bottom of the first 
inning in the doubleheader’s nightcap. But 
UCSD came right back to tie the game in the 

No. 8 Tritons Still in Second After Series Win

By Robert Ingle

CLUB SPORTS — The 33rd 
National Collegiate Taekwondo 
Championships gave the UCSD 
taekwondo club team the opportu-
nity to face the nation’s top fighters 
on April 26 at Stanford University. 
The meet pitted the Tritons against 
many of the top teams includ-
ing the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, UC Berkeley, West Point 
Academy and the hosting Cardinal, 
and was a qualifying meet for the 
U.S. National Team Trials being held 
on May 17 in Denver.

After winning their previous tri-
meet on April 5 at the University of 
Southern California, the Tritons were 
content to move into a tie for second 
place in the Pacific West Conference. 
Earning 18 wins against league 
rivals USC and Stanford gave UCSD 
some momentum heading into the 
national meet. However, despite the 
solid effort against its scrappy league 
opponents, UCSD still had some raw 
nerves about facing the nation’s elite. 

Senior taekwondo president 
Michael Kim was anxious about 
making the trip up to Palo Alto in 
the midst of unknown competition. 
The bantam fighter was particularly 
unsure about the varying levels that 
would be present at the meet, due 
to the UCSD team being relative-

ly young. Kim felt that joining the 
PacWest Conference this year would 
not only help to expose the club to 
college-level contests, but would also 
open the team’s eyes further.

“People of that high caliber, you 
wouldn’t see that unless you were at a 
national tournament,” Kim said.

Once at the meet, the Triton club 
immediately showed its youth and 
inexperience as two of their fight-
ers were disqualified for not mak-
ing the qualifying weight for their 
fighting class. This mistake proved 
to be costly for UCSD. Unlike other 
schools, such as UCLA or MIT, who 
brought upward of 20 fighters, the 
Tritons only brought six members 
of their team and were disappointed 
when that number was cut down to 
four. Yet the young team saw this 
as a lesson learned and moved on 
in the competition with successful 
performances by the remaining team 
members.

Kim earned the third overall 
place in the bantam sparring divi-
sion and qualified for the U.S. team 
trials while freshman Tam Nguyen 
won the poomsae category for third 
dan black belt forms in the female fin 
weight class after several hard-fought 
battles. At all fighting weights and 
styles, there was heavy competition 
due to the prestige of the meet and 
the number of teams present, and the 
Tritons had to work hard to overcome 
these obstacles.

“In my division, there were over 
10 girls fighting to get to the top,” 
Nguyen said. “My second match, 
[which] would determine whether or 
not I would place, was against a 26-
year-old who had many more years 
of experience.”

Though not all were awarded 
with medals, other Tritons fared well 
against the competition, including 
junior Kenneth Eum, who fought a 
tough match against the eventual sec-
ond-place finisher, barely losing 8-11 
in the bantam division. 

Entering the tournament, the 
Tritons had set the goal of send-
ing at least one of their athletes to 
the national team trials, and they 
achieved that through the effort of 
their senior club president, Kim. 
With that goal accomplished, the 
Tritons have begun the transforma-
tion from a rookie organization to a 
veteran one and their sights are now 
set higher knowing that they can 
do battle with the more established 
schools. 

“Our expectation of just getting 
one medal was pretty ambitions,” 
Kim said. “[Achieving it] brings the 
team together, knowing that we can 
compete at that level.”

The next step for the taekwondo 
club is to expand its numbers and 
become a team that takes more mem-
bers to meets such as the National 
Collegiate Championships and to 
begin winning team awards.

Nguyen has high hopes for the 
future of her program and with one 
prestigious meet experience under 
her belt, looks toward improving and 
topping her gold-medal form. 

“As taekwondo athletes, we only 
hope to improve and the only way to 
do so is with hard practice and more 
experience,” Nguyen said. “All we can 
do is to try our best at every competi-
tion and see how far we can get.”
