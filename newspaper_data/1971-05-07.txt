Bank of America Protest Speeches, Dance, Dinner Mark 
30 Demonstrate,SOWatch Cinco de Mayo Festival at UCSD 

Barbaro Simon 
Stoff Writer 

A picket line circled in front 
of the entrance to the Bank of 
America in Ocean Beach while 
what appeared to be a crowd of 
spectators watched during the 
noon hour on Wednesday. The 
demonstration was one of four 
scheduled at local branches of 
the B. of A. by the Peoples 
Coalition for Peace and 
Justice. 

Chanting obscenities and 
anti-war slogans from past 
peace marches, approximately 
thirty people carrying picket 
signs moved continuously 
across the sidewalk in front of 
the bank. Almost as many 
messages as picket signs were 
printed. Examples were " Bank 
of America Blood Bank," and 
"When people have control of 
their lives .. .freedom begins." 

Several members of the 
picket line handed out leaflets 
to passers-by and B. of A. 
customers . A section of one 
leaflet titled .. Anti-war Bank" 
stated that the B. of A. makes 
loans to military contractors 
Involved in the war, and 
maintains one commercial and 
five military branches in South 
Vietnam . 

The article continued that 

"not only in Vietnam. but also 
at home, the B. of A. has a 
history of making a financial 
success out of the common 
people-'s misery." Illustration 
given was that the B. of A. 
supported the bracero 
program, granted loans to 
grape growers to carry them 
through the grape strike, and 
refused to sign contracts with 
the United Farm Workers for 
any of its thousands of acres of 
farmland . 

The purpose of the 
demonstration was to prevent 
"business as usual " and to 
influence people to face 
responsibility for B. of A. 
activities in war support 
ventures . One individual 
withdrew his account from the 
B. of A., placed his bank book 
in a paper bag and burned it as 
a symbolic protest. 

Many of the approximately 
fifty spectators adjacent to and 
across the street from the bank 
were engaged in conversation. 
Members of Non-Violent 
Action, a San Diego group, 
were intermingled with 
citizens and demon trators 
who did not join in with the 
picket line. 

Somewhat ubdued in 
comparison with the picketer . 

the NV A members spoke with 
the angry and the curious about 
the Vietnam war. B. of A., and 
the domestic social and 
economic needs of America. 

Irate citizens of OB 
somewhat mellowed during the 
discussion s wi th NVA 
members , as could be seen 
from their change in voice tone 
and attitude .• They left the area 
smiling, although still in 
disagreement over some 
issues. 

After an hour of picketing, 
the line appealed to bystanders 
to join in marching into the 
bank. The response was less 
than enthusiastic and people 
soon drifted away. One young 
demonstrator commented that 
" this was fun , we should do it 
more often." 

The street speakers from 
V A concluded conversations 

and al 0 left the area . One 
store owner remained outside 
his shop across from the bank . 
When asked by the TT what he 
thought of the demonstration , 
he slowly replied that people 
can no longer ignore the issue 
raised. He said that hi 
business declined almost 
completely during the 
demonstration. but then he 
laughed and returned to work .

Cinco de Mayo, the Mexican national holiday, 
was celebrated at UCSD Wednesday with a 
festival sponsored by MECHA . Among the 
speakers was a Catholic priest who urged 
students " not to get isolated (Crom the 
problems of the community) in your ivory 
towers ." 

The festival began with a program of music , 
dance, and speeches on the Matthews commons. 
Featured was a dance troupe called Ballet 
Folklorico de Aztlan. The j!roup, directed by 
Muir student Esmeralda Enrique. performed 
many traditional Mexican dances. Between 
dance numbers and singing by Teatro Mestizo 
were speeches by several Chicanos. 

Father Juan Hurtado, head of the office of 
ethnic affairs lor the Roman Catholic Church in 
San Diego, spoke on theOlUrch 's response to the 
problems of the Chicano. Hurtadu said the 
office of ethnic difairs was "created because of 
a need for understanding of the problems of 
Chicanos in San Diego." He said that theChurch .... :.04'1 
has been forced to create program in the I 
barrio because of the realization that 25 per cent 
of American Catholics have Spanish surnames. 

Among the programs in San Diego is a draft '" 
counseling service and activIties relating to the 
problems of the Chicano women and migrant 
workers. Father Hurtado urged students to " go 
to the barrio and ghetto so that you know the 
problems of the people and don ' t get isolated in 
your ivory towers." 

Mario Garcia and Felipe Zatarain spoke on 
the significance of Cinco de Mayo. Garcia, a 
graduate student in Third College. explained 
that on May 5, 1862 the Mexican army won a • 
major battle against the French in Mexico 
under Maximilian. Garcia que tioned the value 
of celebrating the event as a victory by "brown 
,people over white people." He said it is good to 
be aware of on 's culture but added that 
"problems will not be solved by knowing who 
we are. " He said that national problem are 
" not necessarily divided along cultural and 
national lines," and urged greater attention to 
an analy i of the exploitative a pects of our 
society. 

Zatarain. a Thinl Cn"~ge ~tudent , said that 
the celebration of Cinco de Mayo may not be 

useful for American·born Chicano . He urged 
Chicano to " throw out the oppre sor and 
reclaim Aztlan." He said Chicano could then 
set a new holiday to celebrate the "new 
independence day." 

Following the program of dance. music and 
peeches tudent were treated to a dinner on 

the Revelle campus. Wednesda night MECHA 
pon ored a dance featuring a an Diego rock 

band , The Syndicate.

Blacks Boycott Football 
Practice at U-Colorado 

BOULDER, Colo. (CPS, - Black football 
players at the University of Colorado, 
boycotting their spring practice sessions, 
accused University Athletic Director Eddie 
Crowder of racial discrimination in a press 
conference last week. 

seeks to penalize the Black players for his own 
inconsistencies ... 

Crowder later met with newsmen but refused 
to comment on all questions concerning the 
situation. 

"Coach Crowder is totally insensitive and 
indiHerent to the reasonable needs and 
expectations of Black people. The Black players 
are treated with disrespect and have no 
confidence in the integrity of Coach Crowder." 

The players refused to elaborate on the 
reasons for the boycott which began two weeks 
ago. One player, offensive ent! Bill Donnell from 
Chicago, reportedly has not joined the other 11 
Black players in the boycott. 

The accusations against the coach were read 
by tailback John Tarver who was accompanied 
by Black teammates. 

The present situation derives in large 
measure, Tarver said, from the dishonesty of 
Coach Crowder ; "He has consistently refused to 
deal directly with Black football players." The 
players further charge, "Coach Crowder has 
develo~ contradictory policies and he now 

It has been rumored that the boycott was 
touched off by an Athletic Department dress 
code including a "no mustache" rule. 
Unconfirmed reports indicated Crowder has set 
Tuesday 's practice session as the deadline for 
the Black players to return to the squad .

(CoDtinUed from page 1) 

utilized for the wron~ purpose. 
Karl Keating, editor of 

DIMENSION and defeated 
presidential candidate, is also 
casting"'3 " no" vote on the 
referendum. He is against the 
fee because he doesn't feel that 
5000 students should have to 
pay the scholarships of a very 
few. "I don' t know why 
students should be forced to 
pay such a fee when funds 
should come from state 
revenues or private sources. 

"I work my way through or 
take out a loan," Keating says. 
" If a student really needs 
money, a long term loan isn't 
so much. It is not morally 
defendable to have to pay for 
the education of a few." 

Keating says be hasn't beard 
anybody suggest why students 
should pay such a fee . Keating 
also hinted that Palcic may be 
using the referendum as a 

campaign issue for the support 
of Paul Kaufman. He felt that 
the idea of the $3 fee was an 
overnight venture, otherwise it 
would have been put on the first 
ballot. 

In reply to Keating's attack, 
Palcic says, "This is absurd. 
Isn't Shaw supporting EOP?" 
Palcic noted that the same 
referendum was almost put on 
last year's ballot. He regards 
the passing of such a proposal 
as an indication of extreme 
motivation and commitment on 
the students' parts to want to 
help alleviate some of the 
economic disparity that the 
state is presently in. 

No Alteraatlve 

According to Palcic, "Loan 
resources are running short 
and there are not enough jobs 
to go around. I didn't want to 
tax the students but feel there 
is no other alternative. This is 

something stUdents could 
really get behind of, and 
benefits would cover all areas 
of financial aid." 

Student comment on the 
referendum appears to be quite 
diverse. Some are definitely in 
favor ')f L'!e proposal , but 
others, such as one Revelle 
junior oppose it: " I don't mind 
EOP students, I just don 't 
choose to pay for one." One 
freshman indicated no 
objection to donating the $3 a 
quarter but didn ' t favor the 
idea of it being mandatory.

CORRECTION 
A serious error occurred in this Tuesday's issue. In the 

article reporting on the AS Election results which appeared on 
page I, runoff presidential candidate David Shaw was rather 
severely misquoted. The statement attributed to him should 
have read : "My election will be an indicator of the reluctance 
of UCSD students to turn to the AS for consideration of 
questions which they find significant. In electing me, students 
are committing themselves and their peers for the satisfaction 
of needs which are real to them and refusing to legitimize a 
purported representative body which is not real to them." 
Sorry, Dave.

NY Court Denies 
Refund to Student 

NEW YORK, NY (CPS)- A 
New York University student 
has been denied a refund of 
tuition fees for classes 
suspended last spring in a 
recent Appelate Court ruling. 

Tbe Appellate Division 0/ 
New York ' s Supreme 
(Superior) Court decided 
unanimously to reverse the 
previous ruling in this case, 
made in Small Claims Court, 
and commented that private 
colleges and universities are 
"free. .from judicial 
restraints" and bad "inherent 
authority to maintain order on 
their campuses" by means 
deemed necessary by their 
administrators. 

The previous ruling directed 
NYU to pay a refund of $277.40 
and legal fees to Roger Paynter 
for classes missed last Spring 
by his son Raymond, a 
sophomore at NYU. Judge 
Patrick Picarriello felt at the 
time the university breached 
its contract by depriving 
Paynter 's son of instruction. 

Judge Picariello called the 
university'S suspension of 
classes a "panic reaction" and 
said tbat NYU " bad not made a 
good-faith attempt to solve 
genuine and long standing 
problems within its own college 
communities." Therefore, he 
felt reparations should be 
made. 

Tbe Apellate Court, on the 
other band, called the 19-day 
closing an "insubstantial 
change," adding that "services 
rendered by the university 
cannot be measured by the 
time spend in a classroom" and 
that no real contract had been 
broken. Moreover , the justices 
said the lower court was 
mislaken in "concluding that 
the university was unjustified 
in suspending classes."

Minority Editorial 

Miscarriage of Justice

members of tile Editorial Board wisb to express 
U opiaioa DOt eDdorsed by tile majority of tbe 
Editorial Board, tbese persoDs are eaabled

Last Monday a student ripped up a 
small, dime-store variety American 
flag in front of 1400 people gathered in 
the gym to hear William Buckley and 
other prominent conservatives . At the 
insistence of an irate citizen, the 
University police escorted the 
offending student out of the gym. No 
resistance was offered, although the 
student did return to get a refund of his 
admission price. 

That student, Soni Ali , is now going 
to be prosecuted by the San Diego City 
Attorney's Office on two misdemeanor 
counts: defacing the flag and 
disturbing the peace. 

The student told the TIMES that he 
was "protesting because William 
Buckley 's political analysis 
represents, in my opinion, the epitome 
of what has to be abolished." It would 
seem that Mr . Ali has a right to form 
his own opinion and to peacefully 
dramatize it, yet under the law, he, if 
conv icted, will face a maximum nine-
month jail sentence for his non-violent 
and non-disruptive protest . This is 
absurd . 

I n our view, responsibility for the 
decision to prosecute rests squarely 
with George Murphy, vice-chancellor 
of student affairs. For it was Mr. 
Murphy who allowed the University 
police report to be submitted to the 
city for "possible" action . But as 
everyone must have known , 
submission of that report made 
prosecution all but inevitable. 

If Mr . Murphy really believes a 
crime might have been committed, he 
should have pursued disciplinary 
action through the appropriate 
campus tribunal. 

But we believe that no crime, in any 
valid sense of the word, was 
committed . We have two points here : 

First, we believe that Mr . Ali 's 
protest gesture should be protected 
under the free speech prov isi on of the 
first amendment . The desecration of 

triton 

the flag was not intended as an end in 
itself, but as an effective means to 
dramatizing strongly and honestly 
held convictions . The criminal 
charges now brought against Mr. Ali 
must be viewed as simple but illicit 
harrassment . Many of the 1400 citizens 
present at the Buckley assembly found 
the protest threatening or offenSive, 
and they wanted it silenced. 

There is a principle involved here . If 
the UCSD pOlice and administration 
can harass one student in the exercise 
of his right to non-disruptive protest, 
they can harass anyone whose protest 
they do not like. 

Our second objection is on political 
grounds. In an interview, Mr. Murphy 
indicated he substantially agrees with 
our first point, but allowed the police 
report to go through because he knew 
the University would come in for 
criticism if he did not. Mr. Murphy 
told the TIMES: "The action was so 
flagrant and in front of so many people 
that many of the options we ordinarily 
have open to use were removed . .. " 

We object most strenuously to this 
line of reasoning . Mr. Murphy would 
like to have done the right thing, he is 
tell ing us, but the pressures were too 
great. 

We have long experience- with Mr . 
Murphy and generally respect him, 
but we feel that in this case his effort 
to protect a student aga inst outside 
pressures fell far short of what it 
should have been . His claim that 
failure to submit a police report would 
have made certain University officials 
liable for criminal charges leaves us 
cold. We do not believe it . 

There are countless cases every day 
in which prosecution to the letter of the 
law would bring about a miscarriage 
of justice. Responsible officials at all 
levels, if they are doing their jobs, 
prevent these kinds of cases from 
coming to trial . George Murphy, so far 
as we are concerned, failed that 
responsib il ity. 

We are not arguing here for a "cover 
up." Any of the 1400 people present 
last week in the gym could have 
pressed the charge. But the 
University didn't have to do it for 
them.

The Ch icken Soup 
Conspirocy

"Since either the middle or around the 20th of April, 1971 , a 
committee has convened to pick a person to replace Alan 
'Batchelder as Muir College Dean. To date, four candidates 
have been interviewed and three more are to follow. There 
seems to be few people who know of the decisions that are 
going to be made that will effect them. 

The other day I was walking around campus wondering what 
people were up to. I met a small lad with a pudgy face and a 
simple smile. " Hello, II I said. 

" Hello,:' he replied. 
" I've never really ever seen you on Muir before. What are 

you taking? II • 
"Oh, I don't think I'm really' taking' anything. I'm going to 

be your new Muir College Dean." 
"Congratulations! How did you do it!?! It would seem like an 

incredible job to get through all the red tape of this place to do 
such a feat unnoticed. II 

" It was really easy," answered the boy in the baseball suit. 
"I knew everybody." 

" Yeah, I guess if you know the right people you can get 
anything done, can't you? " 

" I suppose so. II 
" Will you be able to work with the Provost of the College?" 
"Sure! I don't see why not. All I have to do is do what he 

wants me to do. That seems easy enough. II 
"Well , how about the students' side of things?" 
"No trouble there, either. The Provost knows what 's 

happening. " 
"Really ! That sure is interesting. Well , it's really been nice 

talking with you. Take it easy and have a good day; we'll be 
seeing you." 

"Fine. And it's been nice talking with you," he said as he 
picked up his mitt and walked with his beagle across campus. 

Will the wrong man be chosen for the job of Muir College 
Dean? We hope not. We would like to see a man who is 
responsive to Muir's student population and a man who is easy 
to talk with-not someone who we think would knuckle under to 
the demands of the Provost. 

TT RS TO THE EDITOR 
Vote Muskie 
Dear Editor: 

We are four young people 
who believe that Senator 
Muskie should be the next 
Democratic nominee for 
President. We beli~"c that 
Senator Muskie would offer the 
country the best leadersh ip to 
end the war in Indochina and to 
br'ng sociai jU!ltice here at 
home. 

On Thursday. May 6th at 7 
p.m. in conference rooms K & 
N. Aztec Center. San Diego 
State College. we have invited 
young people from throughout 
the San Diego metropolitan 
area to meet and discuss the 
formulation of a local 
committee to support Senator 
Muskie's campaign. We have 
been in touch with the 
Washington national campaign 

organization. Lanny Davis, 
national coordinator of Youth 
Coalition for Muskie , will be at 
the meeting to discuss wha t is 
happening in other parts of the 
country. We hope you will be 
able to make the meeting. 

If you have any friends whom 
you think would be interested 
in attending the meeting , 
please feel free to call and 
invite them.

" Make the Muir 
(TRITON TIMES, 
such inquiry by :~~s:~~~.:~ place. I feel it n 
answer Mr. Chan ' s crude 

The Muir College Council acted upon 
the recommendations of its own faculty· 
student commission which had studied 
various information with respect to 
curriculum problems, especially those 
uniquely associated with Muir, and had 
presented its findings in the Warner 
Springs Report during the fall quarter of 
this year. This report was expanded and 
incorporated into a number of separate 
proposals submitted to the· faculty in 
mid-February of this year. These plans 
ranged from a recommendation for 
dropping of all but graduation 
requirements to the proposal for 
relaxing requirements to allow students 
more individualistic choice in fulfilling 
the requirements. Along with these 
ideas were specific proposals that would 
improve the lower division classes at 
Muir. This is the essence of what the 
Muir College Council has been working 
on for the past two years while only 
"allegedly" representing the students of 
Muir. 

Next, Mr. Chan dismisses Provost 
Stewart's Open House as " oral 
diarrhea" thus criticizing one of the few 
programs. indeed the only program. 
which has been instituted on Muir to 
gauge undergraduate student opinion 
and combat any possible 
misrepresentation of the students to 
which Mr. Chan claims to be so 
sensitive. If these meetings have been 
characterized by some sort of abnonnal 
malady, it is not the fault of the Provost. 
but that of the students for not taking the 
opportunity to express themselves and 
develop the meetings into fields of 
communication and meaning.

The Muir Colleg~ Council consists of 
six (acuity members and six student 
members. as well as the Dean and 
Provost. It has not always and will not 
always reflect only student desires. This 
is part of the developing strength of the 
council and consequently by no stretch 
of the imagination can Richard Chan's 
accusation of " bureaucracy , 
inhumanism and one sidedness" be 

Furthermore, if Mr. Chan truly fee ls 
that the Muir College Council's 
proposals were not representative but 
ignorant of the students' views and that 
Provost Stewart's Open House is 
unproductive. then he could easily 
attempt to do something more 
constructive than to simply write an 
incoherent letter of complaints. With 
the college elections approaching. Mr. 
Chan has an excellent opportunity to 
"right the wrongs" he finds so prevalent 
throughout John Muir College. 
Unfortunately. the apathy that he so 
eloquently describes as " rapidly 
invading our lives" is not a disease that 
attacks innocent victims: it is the state 
of mind that Mr. Chan so effectively 
typifies : Yell about superficialities 
without investigation and then just " let 
it all ride."

Sacramento Report 

New Anti-Student Legislation 
Richard J. Twohy 

Editor', Note: Iticlta,d J. Twolly is lite uc 
.,lIden' Iohhyisl in Sac,arnenlo. 

The UC student lobby has been in .operation 
for over eight weeks, and we are able now to 
begin a series of reports on this effort to make 
use of " the System" for advancing student 
concerns. 

This first report summarizes legislation the 
Lobby is acting upon, and gives an overview of 
how students can make this effort succeed. 

Policies for the lobby are set by the Student 
Body Presidents Council. Because the effort 
(first full-time Student Lobby in the nation) was 
begun so late for this Legislative session, the AS 
Presidents have been unable to obtain the 
widespread student input to confirm these 
legislative policies. We expect for the next 
session, however, to advance a referendum or 
series of questionnaires to make the Lobby's 
work broadly representative of current student 
opinion. In addition, those students who 
disagree with positions adopted by the Lobby 
will have free access to our facilities (mimeo, 
etc.) and we will arrange appointments for 
them to see Legislators to advance their own 
most important concerns. The aim of this total 
effort is to enable everyone, whatever his 
views, to PARTICIPATE IN THE DECISIONS 
WHICH AFFECT HIS LIFE. 

Under current Regent guidelines, the lobby 
can only act on matter likely to affect the 
University. The legislation as summarized here 
reflects that policy. 

A.B. 1306 (Authorized by Assemblyman 
Wakefield who last year introduced the anti-
school busing act): This bill would require all 
full time students and faculty members each to 
pay $100 per year into a special fund for repair 
of campus facilities damaged " by vandalism or 
riot". Applies to UC and State Colleges. Part-
time students would pay less ; any unused 
money would be refunded pro-rata. 

The student lobby is authorized to oppose this 
bill, as it requires a limited portion of the 
citizenry who are not involved in the described 
activity liable for those who are. Presumption 
of guilt is placed on all who attend the 
University, similar to requiring only bus drivers 
and riders to pay when a bus bench is damaged, 
no matter who did it. To be consistent, the 
author should also require all police as 
individuals to pay when another officer. even in 
a different city, engages in police violence. 

Wakefield 's failure to apply his theory 
consistently merely highlights the punitive 
nature of this bill . 

Finally, the bill encourages student and 
faculty to take the law into their own hands, 
to protect their money; and would require the 
many taxpayers in this group to pay twice for 
repair of damaged facilities . Clearly, efforts 
are needed to assist the resolu tion of social 
conflict without violence ; but this bill seems 
hardly the way to do it. 

The bill has not been set for hearing at this 
time; when it is set, we will advise you of the 
committee members you may wish to write. 
For the present. it is of interest that Wakefield 
received 52 per cent of the vote last November; 
those of you living in or near Downey (LA ) may 
want to notify him you're keeping an eye on his 
activities up here. Address: Floyd L. Wakefield, 
Assemblyman, 52nd District. State Capitol 
Bldg., Sacramento 9581t 

A.B. 59 (Bill Greene) would , among other 
effects, provide a possible graduate tuition of 
$2,500 per year. The bill 's provisions in this 
respect are probably unenforceable under 
California's Constitution which provides Regent 
independence from the Legislature in setting 
UC policy; but the concept itself is so obviously 
to limit graduate education to the wealthy that 
it seems best not to wait for a court test but 
rather to oppose its passage at all . 

Bill Greene is generally a friend of higher 
education; but as a Black legislator his main 
concern is improved vocational training 
opportunities for his constituents, and this bill 
was written with the idea that if graduate 
students pay a very high portion of their costs 
then money could be freed for vocational 
instruction. This bill has been opposed by the 
chairman of the UCLA Black Faculty Caucus 
who states the one effect is to close off 
advanced education opportunities to many 
Third World persons. 

You are urged to write to Hon. Bill Greene. 
Assemblyman, 53rd District (LA ); State 
Capitol Bldg., Sacramento 95814. Mention the 
bill number, be brief and constructive, give 
reasons for your view. ask him to respond, 
particularly if you are from his district. 

Note the bill number when you write, and 
please, do it now. The Berkely election and 
Madison Wisconsin referendum show what 
students can do when we get ourselves together.

Errors Down Tritons 
Freshman Pete Yocky limited a strong UC Irvine team to six 

hits, including a solo home run in the fourth inning, but was the 
victim of six Triton errors which enabled the Anteaters to 
down the Tritons 6-1 on Wednesday afternoon. Irvine, now 27·14 
and victors over UCLA and USC, remains a leading contender 
for the NCAA college division play-offs, while the Tritons need 
a double win over Biola on Saturday to close their season with a 
12-12 mark. 

In the game played at UCSD, the Tritons threatened in the 
first inning when Curtis Jenkins !.~ I led off with a solid 
single to right and Dave Wright 1.328, reached first on a 
sacrifice bunt fielding error. But with runners on first and 
second with DOne out, Irvine pitcher Bob Barlow got Ste.ve 
Shepherd (.364) to lift a short fly to right and then struck out 
Yocky (.266) and George Horman (.297) to survive the inning, 
The strike-()uts were an indication of what was to come as 
Barlow, one of a corps of outstanding Irvine pitchers, ended up 
by striking out 13 UCSD batters over the nine-inning contest. 

An error by firstbaseman George Horman, followed by a 
stolen base, put an Irvine runner in scoring position at the start 
of the second inning. After the next batter flied out to center 
fielder Wright, Mike Sheline singled sharply to center, but 
Wright's throw sailed over the head of catcher, Jerry Pittman, 
and Irvine had a I~ lead. Yocky contributed to the score by 
failing to back up the throw which would have nailed the 
runner, who had temporarily stopped at third . 

UCSD made it 1-1 in the bottom half of the inning when Ron 
Bush (.347 , bunted a single , went to second on a missed pick-off 
attempt, advanced to third on Pittman's infield hit, and scored 
when another pick-()ff attempt on Pittman went astray. 
Besides tying the game, the run continue<J the Triton record of 
not having been shut out in any game this season. 

A walk , stolen base, two errors by ankle-injured Steve 
Shepherd at third after two men were out, and a single past 
third accounted for three Irvine runs in the third inning, to put 
them ahead 4-1. With two out in the fourth , Rocky Craig caught 
a high curve and lifted it over the left field fence for the 
Anteater's only earned run off Yocky, and a 5-1 lead. Irvine's 
sixth run came in the sixth inning on a walk , stolen base, and 
another two out throwing error by Horman, who had been 
belatedly switched with Shepherd after the disasterous third 
inning. 

The game Tritons threatened again in the fifth , sixth. and 
seventh innings, but Barlow's effective pitching stifled the 
attempted come·backs. Dave Wright and Ron Bush each had 
two hits for the Tritons, with Dave also adding two stolen 
bases. The diamondmen close their season with a doubleheader 
at Biola on Saturday and will be gunning for a .500 season mark 
behind pitchers Guy Lowery 15-21 and either Jimmy Robinson 
12-11 or Yocky 13-4 ).

Sports Budget Cut? 
The UCSD PE Department 

will be facing a crippling 10 per 
cent budget cut Cor the 1971·72 
school year. The Registration 
Subcommittee on Budgets will 
hold an open meeting on 
Tuesday May II at 5 p.m. in 
-Conference Room A, Matthews 
Campus. The subcommittee 
will be hearing and looking for 
student support for the PE 
Department, and the budget 
now su bmitted. 

In an interview with coach 
Howard Hunt, it was found that 
the PE Department has 

submitted a budget of $76.000. 
which. in the words of Coach 
Hunt, is one of the leanest, 
most accurate budgets in the 
UCsystem. 

The result of having such an 
accurate budget. not padded. is 
that in the event of a 10 per cent 
cut , the PE Department would 
be hard-pressed to function at 
any substa ntial leve\. 
Intercollegiate team members 
and interested parties are 
invited to attend the meeting 
and express their views. 

Tennis Tourney Set 
The UCSD Tennis Club is sponsoring a mixed doubles tennis 

tournament on Saturday, May 15, open to students, faculty and 
staff. 

Entry forms are available in the PE office and $1 per team is 
payable the day of the tournament at the desk . 

The deadline to enter the tournament is May 13.
