Shoots 
for More 
Books

Staff Writer 

Within the confines of the 
Hwnanities Library at Revelle 
there is a group of science fiction 
fans who have tried to maintain a 
paperback collection library for 
their exclusive reading enjoyment. 

Called the 'UCSD Society for 
Fantasy and Science Fiction,' the 
group has had little success in 
persuading the library into 
allocating more recreational 
reading funds toward fiction 
materials, especially science and 
fa ntasy. 

After A Hard Day 

" Most of the paperbacks in the 
Hwnanities Library are non-
fiction," sait! Peggi Derose, one of 
the founders of the science fiction 
student organization. She added, 
"People want mOI'e books on the 
shelf so that they can sit down and 
enjoy them after a bart! day of 
study." 

The problem was somehow 
complicated by a literature 
professor's donation of a rare 
collection of science fiction to the 
Central University Library. Some 
100 paperbacks and magazines 
were received in 1970 but still 
haven't been catalogued. 

Adding to this difficulty, the 
paperbacks donated by Derose to 
the Humanities Library have 
already been stolen. 

"We hope some of the problems 
will be resolved through making 
the books in the Central Ubrary 
more accessible to students and 
replacing those that are worn out 
or stolen in the Humanities 
Library," said Derose. 

"FaDSceoe" 

Some of the activities planned by 
the "UCSD Society for Fantasy & 
Science Fiction" will be to include 
articles, letters, short stories, and 
fa ntasy in a new publication called 
Fanscene. 

A few speakers and films are 
planned for the winter and spring 
Quarters, including the literature' 
d partment's sponsorship of a 
science fiction class to be taught in 
the spring. 

Last year the group sponsored 
"Barbarella" which, along with 
"The Devil & Miss Jones," was one 
of the big moneymakers. 

'The UCSD Society for Fantasy 
and Science Fiction' has open 
meetings for interested students on 
Mondays from5:30to7 pm to share 
viewpoints and discuss science 
fiction with its social implications. 

In addition, the club plans to set 
up trategy meetings to deal with 
the library's lack of available 
clcnce fiction materials.

Musa Challenges 
Foes to Debate 

by James G. Soto 
City Editor 

Before a crowd of around 100 
here Wednesday, Socialist 
Workers Party (SWP) US Senate 
Candidate Omari Musa challenged 
Democratic and Republican 
candidates to "debate the issues" 
with him here or anywhere in 
California. 

During his appearance at the 
Revelle plaza, Musa described the 
history of the Democrats and the 
Republicans as being one of not 
being responsive to the issues. 

Musa said that the goal of the 
SWP and his candidacy is "to build 
an organization whose whole 
perspective is not to just pressure 
Democrats or Republicans but to 
act as a viable party." 

A self-described revolutionary 
and socialist. he said that he would 
" put capitalism in the toilet." 
Musa contends that Republicans 
and Democrats have no intention 
of solving the economic problems, 
becalL'Ie if they wanted to, it would 
be easy enough by using money 
normally spent on defense and 
advertising. 

The loterests of Big Business 
Musa was particularly harsh on 

the Democratic party. "The 
Democratic party is a dead end 
... the party has always served the 
interests of big buSiness," said 
Musa. 

As a representative of the SWP, 
Musa said "We have to establish 
an independent movement of 
working people organ~ed as a 
political movement as well as a 
labor movement" 

Musa was quick to point out that 
his election would not guarantee 
immediate change. He told the 
audience "Don't get the im-
pression that voting for me will 
solve the problems, but neither will 

voting for Hayden, Goldwater or 
any other Senate candidate." 

He continued, " I don't believe in 
the ajax tornado cleaning up the 
problem or some white knights in 
shining armor." Musa said if he 
were elected he would turn over 
the money he received for staff to 
organize in order to get more 
people like him elected. 

He said this was necessary 
because he would be outvoted 99-1. 
in the present Senate. 

Musa believes that there are only 
"tactical differences in the two 
major political parties on how to 
oppress people, and not whether to 
oppress them. " 

Part of the Way with LBJ 
Musa sharply criticized 

Democrat Tom Hayden, saying he 
(Hayden) was willing to call off the 
student protest movement at the 
1968 Chicago Convention if the 
Democrats agreed to nominate 
Eugent McCarthy. 

He also said Hayden supported 
President Johnson in his election 
campaign in 1964. Hayden went 
"part of the way with LBJ," Musa 
said. 

On the economy, Musa said that 
every politician says they are for 
jobs, but few act to make the 
money available. He said he would 
sponsor a bill to put a 100 percent 
tax on incomes over $50,000. 

Musa spoke at great length about 
school segregation and bussing. 
He said about the bussing problem 
threat, "the issue is not the bus, it 
is us in the bus." Musa continued 
by saying that there has always 
been bussing in the United States 
for a variety of reasons. 

"Democrat and Republicans 
have not seen fit to address the 
issue (of bussing) . It isn't an 
abstract issue, it is an issue that is 
going to move here," Musa said. 

Fed to Study UCSD 
Grant Procedures 

In response to a US Senator's 
request, the Federal General 
Accounting Office (GAO) will 
study the methods used at UC San 
Diego for attractir.g federal grants 
and contracts. 

According to Harry Moore, a 
UCSD grants and contract officer, 
GAO auditors Frank Willis and 
Barry Molnar will visit UCSD 
Monday and Tuesday to find out 
why UCSD has been more suc-
cessful in gathering federal sup-
port than many larger schools. 

The GAO is making the study at 
the behest of Senator James B. 
Pearson (Kansas ), who asked for a 
review of federal grants and their 
geographical distribution. 

Unnecessary or Unjustified 
Imbalance 

In Wednesday's San Diego 
Union, it was reported that 
Pearson was concerned that there 
might be an unneccessary or un-
justified imbalance in the 
geographic distribution of grants 
and contracts. 

Brown in 
San Diego 
Today 

San Diegans will be given the 
rar€ ooportunity to sit down with 
Gov. Brown and talk about his 
administration, and California in 
general, at a n~host luncheon at 
the US Grant Hotel today at noon. 

Brown will give a brief report on 
his administration 's first year and 
then field qqestions from the 
audience. . 

" The purpose of this format will 
be to provide a dialogue between 
San Diegans and the governor on 
any topic," Gray Davis, Brown's 
executive secretary said last week. 

Davis said Brown called the 
meeting from a desire for wide 
ranging dialogue with the people. 

The meeting will be unique, 
Davis said, because in the past 
Brown's public sessions had been 
limited to single-issue discussions. 

Lunch is $5, but one is not 
required to buy lunch to talk to 
Brown. 

Currently UCSD ranked fifth in 
the nation in total federal grant.~ 
and contracts awarded to colleges 
and universities. 

The Union reported that GAO 
auditor Willis said that Kansas an- I 
other midwest areas are amon.: 
the "pockets of weakness' fo .' 
attracting federal research an' \ 
development awards. 

Willis told the Union that "UCST) 
is an example of a school that hl:\ ' 
come from near the back of -hI! 
pack to the top in a relatively ShOi t 
time. " 

Help Other Institutions 
Willis said Pearson's study t f 

procedure is intended to see wm. . 
the federal government might dc t ) 
help other institutions build l') 
their research programs. 

Moore told the Triton Times 
Wednesday that the GAO audit II s 
will study the procedures at U( iD 
for getting federal grants . 1d 
contracts. 

Will is and Molnar will intervl.!w 
campus administrators and 
scientists to find out why UCSD is 
such an attractive place, Moore 
said. 

He added that the GAO is goin ! 
to talk to department heads to fin I 
out " whether or not departmental 
sup:>ort grants have been suc-
cessful in raising departments to a 
level (in regards to faculty, labs , 
etc.) where they can attrac:; 
succeeding federal support." 

The Role of cripp 
Other factors that will be con-

sidered by the GAO include the role 
of Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography and the Medical 
School in complimenting th( ' 
general science programs of the 
main campus. 

Willis and Molnar will also visit 
four other campuses around the 
nation to investigate their 
procedures and determine why 
they are or are not getting federal 
monies. 

Federal agencie which disperse 
funds will be a subject of the ~tudy 
later. 

Pearson was part of a similar 
review of federal grants 
procP.dures 10 years a go and has 
been interested in the federal role 
in higher education for much of his 
career.

'Elitist' in Forulli 

by Margaret Krueger 
Staff Writer 

The woman's role in Chicano society wa th theme of a panel 
discussion held Wednesday night at the International Center. 

The forum was sponsored by Mujer, an organization of Chicanos and 
other Latinas. Members of the UC San Diego Chicano community sat as 
panalists. 

The emphasis of the presentation was on the traditional rol of th 
Chicano woman versus the goals of today's Chicano 10men. Most of th 
panel felt that the " Women's Lib ration Movement" was not a good title 
for the efforts of the Chicano women. 

Women's Liberation was termed an " eliti t movemelt" who primar 
concern is to campaign against men. Panelists said the ne ds of Chicano 
women differ from the needs of white middle class women. 

Figbt For Education 
There was also discussion on th outlook of the Chi OIlUllUDit 

whole. Reference wa mad to UCSD a " bt:\..vlllill 11101 t! ::UJU 11M a

On speaker said, " In the slums, minorities ar made to fi 1htfor f on '

efforts to recruit minority tud nts, feeling that thi wa a " corruption of

Lo~ 
Blows 
and Cheap 

by Edward Simons Shots 
Tennessee's Tuxedo 

I was just settling down for a quiet evening of unadulterated hedonism 
and gluttony when Tennessee called to let me know it was his birthday. 

I "Hey, you soulless cretin," Tennessee soothingly screamed, " it's my 
birthday." 

One had to admire the man's directness. Most of the slime at UCSD 
would invite you out to dinner and then tell you it's their birthday. What 
can you do but pay the check? 

Anyway, the plan was to rendezvous at Mom's, a latter day saloon in 
Pacific Beach. 

Let me tell you a little about Tennessee. A1; the bio majors 8!"0ng y~u 
may have guessed, Tennessee is not my friend's r~a} nal?e. ~1S name IS 
really John Taylor but we call him Tennessee to dlsbngulsh hun from the 
other, more obsequious, John Taylor. . 

John's nickname comes from NashvLlle, Tenn., where he has gone for 
the past thre(' summers to sell dictionaries. He comes to school late 
I every fall , but lean and hard from working, IS-hOllr nays selling books.J-!e 
also has a Southern accent, which he loses about three days before the' 
fir~t midterm. 

Malor intellects both, Jonn and I atte~ded tha.t ~reat institute of higher 
yearning, St. Augustine High School. Samts, as It IS called, was an all~boy 
high school, run by the Augustinian Orde~ - a poP!-llar gang of cleriCS. 
Saints was, and is, known for its crazy priests and Lts sex-starved young 

men ' h t ' t I a ~tended Saints for only one year, at the end of whlc I went ou In 0 
the ( esert for three years (to gain strength) . John finally, t~rough a 
combination of hard work, native intelligence and extortIOn, was 
graduated from Saints surruna cum frustrare. I was graduated from 
Pa 10 Verde Valley High School and Machine Shop the ~me year. . 

What brought about our fateful reunion in USB 2722 I~ the fall of I?72 ~ 
a question the biographers will ask ad nauseum. The unportant thing IS 
that it happened. . 

So when Tennessee invited me to an impromptu party at Mom's, 1 did 
not ;egret at all calling the three women with W~lO~ I ha~ pl~nned to 
indulge myself to let them know it was off. They dldn t take It with much 
grace I was forced to be cruelly honest. 

I st~pped by the campus that Wednesday night to have a cup of coffee 
before the Mom's number when I ran into Alex. John and Alex are good 
friends . Alex has a black belt in karate, a brown belt in aikido and an odd, 
pastel shade of underwear. Which 01 the three is more impressive is open 
to question. I immediately told him of the 9 pm meeting at Mom's. He 
was in, no questions asked.

Will George Calhoun'. outllde 
shooting be milled? 

by Dave Eiaea 
Sports EdItor 

For the second straight year, the 
UC San Diego varsity basketball 
team has been bitten by the 
ineligible player bug. 

Gary Nash, a 6'10" center from 
Mt. SAC Junior College and Cai 
state Fullerton, has been declared 
athletically ineligible to play for 
the Tritons. Less than a year ago, 
it was guard Mack Parker found to 
be ineligible, costing UCSD a berth 
in the NAIA play-offs two days 
later. 

The loss of Nash might cost the 
Tritons a play-off spot this year, 
but only because the team will be 
missing a very high quality center. 
Nash was reportedly used three 
seasons by his JC coach. 

Because of this, the senior has no 
more seasons of playing time left. 
"He would have been the first 
legitimate big center in this 
school's history," said disap-
pointed head coach Barry Cun-
ningham.

UCSD Takes First Play-off, 
Second Round Tomorrow 

by Scott Sadil 
Staff Writer 

Despite a week's absence from the soccer field, the UC San Diego 
soccer team made the worst of their season reprieve by defeating Cal 
Lutheran, 2-0, Wednesday afternoon in the opening round of the NAIA 
District 3 play-offs. 

Olajide Shokumbi opened the scoring for the revived Tritons with a 
short goal midway through the first half. Action was relatively even 
throughout the rest of this period until a crucial play just before in-
termission. 

Cal Lutheran penetrated deep into UCSD territory and drove a hard 
kick past the diving Triton goalie, Doug Youngdale. Fortunately for 
Youngdale and UCSD the ball hit the goalpost. However, it carommed off 
directly to another CL player. But, instead of getting his team back even 
before halftime, and possibly aiso switching the momentum to their side, 
\he shooter mis-kicked and badly missed the shot. 
- UCSD finally put the game out of reach when UCLA-bound Steve 
Cardona scored what he called " an easy goal" late in the second half. 
Dave Youngdale had passed to Alfonso Gonzales who collided with the CL 
goalie allowing the bal: to dribble free to the unguarded Cardona. 

Tomorrow UCSD plays their second-round playoff match at Pomona. 
Now the Tritons are certain that they need to keep winning if they wish to 
continue their season. 

one exhibition game, Nash 
averaged over 20 points and 10 
rebounds per match, and clearly 
dominated the floor. He was ex-
pected to lead UCSD to one of Its 
most successful basketball seasons 
ever. 

Meanwhile, life goes on for the 
Triton players and coaches. If 
UCSD is to make the play-offs in 
the NAIA District 3, depth at the 
guard position and overall hustle 
appear to be the keys. 

Early in the pre-season, the 
squad looks like this : 

Centers: Lyle Smith and Bob 
Roe. Without Nash, the starting 
job will probably go to Smith, a 
returnee from last season. 6'6" 
and rangy, Smith will be able to 
contain most of the leagues cen-
ters, but not nearly in the same 
powerful manner as Nash. An 
unseUish player, Smith more often 
than not gives up an open shot to a 
teammate, and can get around the 
floor quickly. " He has a lot of 
natural ability and he learns 
quickly. Experience is the only 

th~ng lacking," says Cunningham.

John and Peter (his roommate) arrived late. I should have knowll. He 
was as casual as he was late, which was very. John always looks casual. 
It's in his blood. He was born in a pullover sweater with suede elbow 
. patches-yawning. 

The first thing Tennessee said when he got to our table was "OW! 
Where are the women?" 

A motif, as you might say, had been set. 

Roe, also 6'8", is a transfer from 
Point Lorna. "He'll be one 01 the 
biggest batUers on the team," says 
Cunningham. Since most teams 
... 1lI have a height advantage over 
the Tritons this year, Smith and 
Roe will both need rebounding help 
from the forwards. 

Forwards: Mark Dobransky, 
Lee Brockett, . Doug Skidmore, 
Peter Volk, Chris Wellington, Lee 
Gardner and Adolf Rosecrans. 
With some experience, this could 
become a strong suit, now it's 
about average. Dobransky and 
Brockett are the probable starters, 
and they are opposite-type plavers~ . 
Dobransky, a 6'3" transfer from 
'Grossmont, appears very strong 
under the boards. Against the 
much larger Athletes in Action 
men last week, he got inside often 
'for points and rebounds. 

6'4", Brockett seems more 
comfortable outside, where he can 
launch his outside shots. Brockett 
has become a better rebounder 
during the past year, and could 
blossom into a top performer. 
"Brockett has all the talent," says 
Cunningham. Of Dobransky, the 
coach says, " He's been a very 
pleasant surprise - a real com-
petitor. " 

Skidmore has the ability also, 
evidenced by his Second-Team All-
Grossmont selection behind ex-

: UCLA center Ralph Drollinger a 
few years ago. Chris Wellington, a 
6'4" forward from last year's 
junior varsity team, combines 
strength with a good outside shot, 
and " Chris is ' extremely 
coachable." Volk, a transfer from 
LA Poly, Gardner, a transfer from 
San Bernardino JC, and 
Rosecrans, who played for the 
UCSD JV's two years ago, are the 
others. 

Guards: Mallory Mitchell, Tony 
Moore, Bart Bradley, Eric Finkle 
and Ken Melvin. The only thing 
missing here is a consistent outside 
bomber, someone to replace 
George Calhoun's long shots from 
last season. According to Cun-
ningham, Mitchell "has ail the' 
tools to be the finest guard UCSD 
has ever had." A magician with 
the ball, Mitchell owns the school 
one-game and one-season assist 
records, and will probably pass 
Steve Kircher for tops in the all-
time assist department this year. 
Only a junior, Mitchell also 

posse~es a good outside touch. 
The other probable starter is the 

team's only senior Tony Moore. 
"A very aggressive and physical 
player," says Cunningham, " and 
also a streak shooter." There is 
very little drop-off to the ability of 
the other guards, forming the 
squads most glaring strength. 

Finkle could be the shooter the 

M., (5 t{ocL t{otI,ers Oaac. c.. 
~(' Q;(C~, 

Page&ilree 

team has been looking for. With a 
smooth outside shot, Finkle can be 
counted on for some quick points. 
Bradley is a consistent all-around 
guard, and very strong defen-
sively. Melvin, a transfer from 
Foothill JC, has enough moves to 
add to the Triton point total. 

Otbers : UCSD has other 
possibilities, including Dave 
Christopher, Bill Hoffman, and 
Gary Dodson. None have seen any 
action yet, with Dodson due to join 
the team In January. 

Triton guard Mollory Mitchell

Coacbes: Barry Cunningham 
and Dick Satterlee. In his fifth 
year as head coach and seventh 
totally, Cunningham usually gets 
what he asks for from his players. 
A knowledgeable basketball man, 
CUlUlingham has concentrated on 
defense in the early practices, and 
is now catching his team up of-
fensively. Formerly the coach at 
Coronado High School, Satterlee is 
in his first year as Cunningham's 
assistant. 

The outlook: Bright, but not as 
bright as a week ago, when the 
squad had Nash. The team is 
aggressive, has spirit, plays 
defense, and has some leaders. 

With some luck, 1975-76 could be 
a play-off year.
