A Place for Everything at Earl~s 
OPENING: New Warren College 
convenience store offers wide array 
of products, stays open later 
By Janna Palmer 
Associate News Editor 
and Mary Beth Sedlack 
Guardian Reporter 

Whether you're searching for caramel crois-
sants, creme de menthe coffee, cold medicine or 
condoms, Earl' s Place, a new convenience store 
located above Canyon Vista Restaurant. has got it. 

Earl 's Place, which opened its doors to the public 
last month, is something of a cross between a 7-11 
and an upscale coffee shop. Unlike the Sunshine 
Store in the Price Center. the Warren store stocks 
gourmet goods, such as Newman 's Own spaghetti 
sauce and Dryers ' Ice Cream . 

"We clon't really need another Sunshine tore; 
this makes Earl 's Place more unique," !>a id Karin 
Lewcock, a part- time student supervisor al Earl's 
Place. 

One of about 20 Earl ' s Placeemployee~. Lewcock 
said thatthe store is really compo"ed of two I>eparate 

entities, the convenience store and the coffee shop. 
The left side of the store se ll s such practical 

items as laundry detergent, soup and blue book!>, a 
va t array of snack items i ncludi ng se l f-~erve fro-
zen yogurt. Coke and p tato chips. The ri ght ~ ide o f 
Earl' s Place is devoted to se lling gourmet co ffee!> 
and other hot drinks, along with pa!> lrics and bi!>colli . 
Several tables and chairs are available for patron~ 
both inside and outside the store. 

Accordll1g to enior S upervl~or anc, FiliI. 
one of the main concerns of the Illangcr, al Earl' ~ 
Place is to provide the product~ that .,IUdenl., nccd . 
"We try 10 get the products thai e\eryone wanl .,. 
We try to be extremely cu~tomerdriven," FiltL stlid. 

rn addition to its ~elect i on of products and it, 
location on the Warren campus, Earl's PlaL:l:! i!> 
open until midnight all w·eek.ln fact, busi ne!>~ plds

Earl'~ Place is ~omewhat more expen~ive Ihan 
other stores on campus, largely be(.;au~e of 11\ 
emphasis on gourmet items. Lew(.;od.. ,aid thc

UCSD Graduate Examines Religious Cults in New Bool 
By Karen Cheng 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD alumnus Mark Laxer 
included a warning on the back 
cover of his recently pubJ ished 
book, Take Me for a Ride: COlli' 
illg of Age ill a Destructive CLllt, 
"Fly east, tly west, but don ' t fly 
into a cuckoo's nest," wrote Laxer, 
who graduated from MuirCollege 
in 1988 with a B.A. in English-
American Literature. 

For Laxer, who now works as a 
computer software engineer in 
Washington, D .C., the warning 
embodies the me sages and con-

~eq uences of cults. But the se lf-
published book has a personal 
meaning for Laxer as well. 

Take Me For A Ride is a book 
about Laxer's intimate dealings 
with the followers of Rama Fred 
Lenz' cult. Having met Profe sor 
Frederick Lenz while in high 
chool in New York. Laxer was 

intrtgued by Lenz's philosophy, 
which revolved around Eastern 
my'>ticism in conjunction with 
American pop cullure. 

Laxer and Lenz became close 
friends, started a new-age medita-
tion group and moved to San Di-

ego. 
Laxer began attending 0 

in 1979, when he staned a chapter 
of Rama Lenz's new age medita-
tion group. According to Laxer, 
meditation group and cults were 
very popular on campus 15 years 
ago, and UCSD was the " hub" of 
cult acti v ity. 

In fact, much of the book deals 
with Lnxer's cult expcrience!> at 
UCSD.

Aquarium Video Snares Honors 
The "Blue Planet Theater: a video program on 

permanent display at the Stephen Birch Aquarium-
Museum at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, 
has been selected to receive a Golden Eagle award 
from the Council on International Non·theatrical Events 
(CINE) in Washington, D.C. 

The Golden Eagle is the highest award given by 
CINE, a norr·profit organization that selects films and 
videos for entry in international competitions. The 
Scripps program, which portrays the story of water and 
how it interacts with all earth systems, was honored by 
CINE in the category of marine environments. 

The "Blue Planet Theater," produced by Bill Call 
and Chuck Colgan of the Scripps Video Unit, is a ten-
minute video presentation that is shown at the en-
trance to the Scripps Hall of Oceanography. It intro-
duces scientific concepts about water, air, land and 
life exhibited in the museum. 

The program was previously given a Silver Award in 
the category of ecology/environment/conservation 
programs at the 1993 Annual WorldFest·Houston In-
ternational Film & Video Festival and an Honorable 
Mention at the 1993 Columbus International Film and 
Video Festival. The program has also been selected 
for an award in the New York Festival's International 
Non·broadcast Media Competition to be announced in 
January. 

Highway Bridge Project Awarded 
$10.5 Million Federal Grant 

A proposal to build the world's first highway bridge 
composed of advanced composite materials was re-
cently awarded $10.5 million in federal funds from the 
Technology Reinvestment Project. The grant, matched 
by university and industrial participants, came in 
October during the first phase of the government's 
program to help communities convert from a defense-
oriented industrial base to one relying on new techno-

logical enterprises. 
The landmark bridge. which will stretch across 

Interstate 5, will connect the east and west campuses. 
The consortium, working under the direction of 

UCSD Structural Engineering Professors Gilbert 
Hegemier and Frieder Seible. includes UCSD and the 
University of Delaware; E.I. du Pont de Nemours and 
Hercules, Inc. of Alpharetta, GA; Shell Chemical, Co. 
of Houston, TX; Lockheed Missels and Space Co. of 
Palo Alto, CA; B.P. Chemicals, Inc. of Santa Ana, CA; 
and J. Muller International, Trans-Sceince Corp. and 
XXSYS Technologies, all of San Diego. 

As envisioned, the 450·foot·long bridge supported 
by an A-frame pylon will be designed (or two 12·foot 
lanes , two bicycle lanes, a 13·foot pedestrian walkway 
and a utility sefVice tunnel. The bridge will be much 
lighter than its counterparts which are built from steel 
and concrete, as well as more durable and earthquake 
resistant, according to the bridge's designers.

EARL: Store will 
be open 24 hours 
during finals week 
Continued from page 1 

Students are able to use their 
points plan or the Plus card to 
purchase items at Earl's Place, 
which appealed to many custom-
ers. "Earl's Place is very conve-
nient because it takes points," said 
Fifth College student Sujat Shende. 
Plus card users also receive a 10 
percent discount on their pur-
chases, Lewcock said. 

"I feel that Earl's place was the 
result of a natural progression," 
Filtz said. " Il fills a need that din-
ing services doesn't fill." How-
ever, Fi Itz noted that Earl's Place 
is altempting to compliment 
nearby Canyon Vista, not com-
pete with it. 

Some customers at the new 
store said that they enjoyed the 
convenience and hours of Earl' 
Place. "1 like it because I can buy 
the everyday things [need without 
having to go off campus," said 
Warren College freshman Devon 
Lehr.

what Franz ca lled "temporary re-
Juctions in appointments." 

According to Franz, these re-
ductions will mean more flexible 
hours for patient-care staff. Staff 
members' guaranteed hours, or 
appointments, will be reduced to a 
certain percentage of what they 
had been previously. 

The remaining percentage of 
hours will be flexible, so that if the 
number of patient ' increases on a

full-lime employees involved in 
patient care have received notices 
thattheir appointments will becut. 
The cuts are not unex pected, how-
ever. "They were told in June or 
July that there would beachange," 
Franz said. 

"No one's appo intment ha 
been cut lower than 50 percent ," 
said Franz, adding that all taff 
members will be able to retain 
their health benelits. "We want to 
protect the staff, land prevent lay-
offs]," she said. 

Although Thornton has aver-
uged only 17 patients per day dur-
ing the last six months, Franz said 
that this statistic has not signifi-
cantly influenced the decision to 
make taff hours more flexible. 
" We never expected during the 
first year that we'd fill the hospi-
tal," she said. 

Franz added that there was no 
concern among administrators 
overthe low average. She said that 
the average is misleading because 
of the small number of patients 
that came to Thornton during its 
opening weeks. 

"Our patient average is abollt 
20 at this poin t," sa id Ffllnz, who 
added that people have a tendency 
to underestimate the ratio of pa-
tients to beds because they assume 
that all 120 beds are open. " We 
opened with halfofthe beds," said 
Franz, "We're only staffed to the 
second Iloor." 

Franz said that the slow but 
steady rise in the number of· pa-
tients at Thornton was predicted 
when the hospital opened. She 
added that they expec ted Thornton 
to beaveraging45 patients per day 
by the end of its first year.

4 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Tllt'StlllY , ()C't·t'lIIlwl· 2. 1993 

COMMENTARY 

Opponents of gun control ignore the 
obvious - that the Second Amendment is 

irrelevant to the modem age 
B Y D A V I D 5 NOW, 

SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

he Second Amendment, "the right to bear 
arms," is irrelevant to a discussion ofthe 
handgun is ue. In fact, the Second Amend-
ment i itself irrelevant. I propose that we 
remove this anachronistic clause from our 
constitution, or at least retire it to the status of 
an amendment that no longer retlects the 
realities of modem society. 

The recently passed Brady Bill was long overdue. The sad pan 
is that it took a bullet in the head of the White House Chief of 
Staff and 10 years of struggle for something as mundane as a five-
day waiting period on handgun purchases to become law. The 
primary reason for thi s protmcted legislative battle is that oppo-
nents of gun control, most notably the National Ritle Association, 
have been brandishing a powerful image to back up their claims: 
the Bill of Rights. The Second Amendmenl , they ~ay, guamlltees 
the right of American~ to "bear arms." Why, if we ban handguns, 
we might as well re 'cind the right to free speech, or so the 
argument goes. 

The "right to bear arms" has become a patriotic mantra for 
h:mdgun enthusiasts. It' s surprising that, despite their spuriou 
interpretation of the Bill of Rights, there has been little to Cflunter 
this catch.phmse. Let's take a look at the Second Amendment in 
its enti rety: "A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the 
secUlity of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear 
Anm, shall not be infringed." If "right to bear anllS" is the 
mindless slogan of handgun supponers, then "well-regulated 
Militia" should be the counter-slogan of handgun control support-
ers. 

In its original context, the right to bear arms was meant to be 
controlled by, and specifically for, a well-regulated militia. What 
this means exactly in a modem context eludes me. But it certainly 
does not mean that Joe Public has the natuml-bom right to go to 
the comer gun-man and purchase a weapon designed specifically 
for inflicting violence on other human beings. The civic body 
retains the right to regulate who can own arms, what they must do 
to acquire arm , and what kind of arms they can "keep and bear." 

The correctness of this argument is evident in our current 
legislation. The govemment already makes most weapons 
technology off-limits to the geneml public (automatic weapons, 
hand grenades, nuclear bomb ) and handguns should be no 
different. Gun ownership is not a right, but a privilege to be 
"regulated" by the collective citizenry. It is therefore the tight of 
our legislatures to deny the general public the "right" to bear 
handguns irthey so choose. 

All this talk and double-talk about "militias" sounds si lIy for a 
reason: the Second Amendment is a product of the historical circum-

~tanccs surrounding the fomlation of the Bill of Rights, and these 
circumstances no longer ex-
ist in 20th-century America. Stricter Laws? 

While it pains me to say 
0 , Ross Perot has a good 

idea. He has suggested that 
we hold another constitu-
tional convention. States-
men such as Thomas 
Jefferson assumed that the 
document would be updated 
as conditions and needs 
changed. The Second 
Amendment is a clear 
example of a clause that 
bears no relevance to our 
time. In the late 18th

COMMENTARY 

Gun control not only violates Second Amendment rights, but it is 
also ineffectual , even regressive, in the fight again t crime 

B Y D EXT E R 5 I M M 5,

ot long ago, we heard the 
sound of moderate Republi -
cans going "squish" under 
the weight of the Clinton es-
tablishment. They voted for 
the8rady Bill. This new law 
won 't do anything to reduce 
crime but it will certainly 
curtail individual liberties. It 

puts us on a course toward abandoning the Consti-
tution by abolishing the right to bear arms. 

And look how the gun control lobby is going 
about it. Supporters of gun control are some of the 
most creative of historical revisionists. They ex-
pect us to believe that the Second Amendment is 

Ban 'em? 

means of urvival away from frontiersmen - that 
would have been absurd. Most constitutions aren't 
geared to banning the absurd, though thilt could 
explain plenty. The meaning of "the right to bear 
arms" i unambiguous. 

Hi tory can be instmctive. The American Revo-
lution was about ridding the indi vidual of a tynll1-
nical govenllnent that taxed its citizens exces-
ively. Sound familiar? Maybe the Clinton revolu-

tion is just a belated countelTel'olution, and this 
time they don 't want a wcll -armt'd citizenry get-
ting in the way. More seriously, didn't Hitler 
reserve weapons to the state sholtly before blll11ing 
the Reichstaag? 

But let's not impute Illotives. Let's ruke the 
libemlsattheirwordthatgun 
control is just about control-

about regulating 'guns 
and militia rather than 
protecting the right of 
the individual to self 
defense. That's like 
saying that the First 
Amendment really 
means that the presi-
dent orthejudiciary can 
limit expression, but 
Congress can't. 

Here is what Americans think about 
having laws to ban firearms : 

ling violence. If so, they ' re 
not lying, just stupid. Does 
anyone really believe that 
someone with a criminal 
record won' t lind another

COMMENTARY: Promised the flowering of a new age, '93 has been marked by continual blunder, whining and evasion of responsibility 

THE BLAME REMAINS THE SAME 
By Philip MIchaels 
Senior Staff Writer 

Of all the years since the begin-
ning of time, certainly 1993 will 
sparkle throughout history asthell10st 
glorious, the dawn of a new era. This 
was the year that the middle class got 
its tax break, that the rich finally started 
paying its fair share of taxes after 
living high off the Reagan-Bush hog. 
Vice President Gore transformed a 
cold, unfeeling bureaucratic govern-
ment into a warm, loving institution 
that puts people tirst. And if you be-
gan to get the sniffles, the first lady 
herself wou Id dash over to your home 
so that she could hold a cold cloth to 
your fevered brow. 

Oh, wondrous utopia! Oh, brave, 
new world! Oh, gag me ... 

Perhaps it's unfair to look back on 
1993 as the year that Bill Clinton and 
his gang of Kennedy-wannabes ran 
amuck through the White House, 
promisingchangebutdeliveringsquat. 
The new president flip-flopped on 
taxes and Haitian boat refugees, 
dragged his feet on Bosnia and Soma-
liaand proposed anew policy on gays 
in the military that was remarkably 
similar to the old one. The much-
vaunted health-care plan is too vague 
to even criticize intelligently, and it 
will be a small miracle if even half of 
the plan to reinvent government is 
ever enacted. But these things take 
time, as Clinton would be quick to 
remind us. After all, Rome wasn't 
built in a day. Try checking back in 
1996. 

No, if there' s any deeper meaning 

to 1993, it's more thanjustthe year of 
the tloundering executive branch. 
Clinton himself offered a clue in an 
interview with Rollillg SlOlIe. After 
deftly handling fuwningquestions like 
"Are you having fun?," the president 
lashed out at "the knee-jerk liberal 
IllCdia" for giving him such bad press 
(A Democratic president complain-
ing about the liberal media? This is a 
kafka-esque tumofevents. ,.). Clinton 
cried that the media had raised 
everybody's hopes about his admin-
istration, and that if they kept picking 
on him, he'd go tell Hillary, and then 
they'd be sorry. 

Now you mayor may not remem-
ber that just before his inauguration, 
Clinton promised to have the most 
productive administmtion ever within 
his first 100 days in office. (It's okay 
if you don't relllCmber thi s - appar-
ently, Clinton doesn't either. ... ) And 
when those productive I 00 days fai led 
to materialize, Clinton joined in what 
is rapidly becoming the national pas-
time - he blamed someone else. 

If nothing else, 1993 will be re-
membered as the year we avoided the 
blame, a time when accountability 
took an extended lunch break and 
hasn' t been heard from since. Beavis 
and Butt-head are to blame for some 
rug mt who set your house on fire. 
Demon rum is the reason why Bob 
Packwood kept pinching the hineys 
of Senate pages. Illegal immigrants 
are at the bottom of everything from a 
crummy economy to dwindling SAT 
scores. "Who, me?" has become the 
national rallying cry. 

Truly, it was a kidney-stone of a 
year, where excuses, pleas for for-
giveness and half-hearted apologies 
J\Iled the day. There's a virtual sea of 
blame surging out there, and it's time 
to wade in up to our armpits. 
Those uc ...... et Blues 

After three years of playing ''TIle 
Dog Ate Our Budget," the Uni versity 
of California Board of Regents was 
able to find enough spare change un-
derneath its couch in May to give 
retiring Vice President Ronald BrJdy 
a $181,640 going-away present. Then, 
last month, no doubt after weeks of 
clipping coupons and shopping atdis-
count tores, the regents favored UC 
ho pital executives with mises aver-
aging 21 percent over the next two 
years. 

Alas, the news was not so rosy for 
UC students. The best the regent. 
could muster was to cut a proposed 
fee increase of $1,045 per year to a 
measly $680. However, very few stu-
dents took to the streets yelling, "Ya-
hoo! We're paying less money than 
we thought we were going tor' No 
doubt their enthusiasm was di mmed 
somewhat by the news that fees will 
be going up an additional $650 next 
year. 
Viva perotl 

A despondent Perot-ite was being 
interviewed on local television as the 
North Amelican Free Trade Agree-
ment (NAFTA) was being mtitied by 
Congress. "It was dead," he kept moan-
ing. Then he blamed villainous con-
gressmen for swinging last-second 
deals to sway their undecided breth-

ren . Law suits were threatened. H. 
Ross Perot's name was invoked rhe 
way a Baptist calls on Jesus. 

Of course congressmen were 
swinging last-minute deals - that's 
the way thing get done in Washing-
ton, whether it' s Republicans lining 
up for White House large s or Demo-
crats suckling at the swollen teat of 
organized labor. 

You've got to feel bad for Ross. 
First, he looks all grumpy and hentout 
of shape on Larry King, then Con-
gress puts the kabosh on his precious 
anti-NAFT A campaign. l fit '~ not the 
Republican NationalCommittee plai-
ting to di srupt hi s d'lUghter's wed· 
ding, it's Cuban hitmen being hired to 
kill him. Perhaps Ross should take 
some time off, stop and smell the 
roses, have himself a lillie vacation. 
To hell with tact - just si t down and 
shut up, Jug Ears. 
And Justice For None 

In the good old days, beror.: th~ 
ACLU was invented, accused crimi-
nals came up with more il1leresting 
defense trategies l.ike "the butler did 
it" or "Me? I was in Cincinnati on 
bu iness." But in our touchy-fcely-
society-is-to-blame cu lture, defen· 
dants n '" invoke enough 
psychobubbl, :onfuseevcn the most

I(' s rather tiltll1g, then, that in the

and only receive a slap on the wri:.l. a 
man can ~m a . h a brick into

centu ry, however, it was wholly ju ~ti ­
tied. 

The founding fathers were wary of 
tyrJnny, and rightly so. The "well-
regulated militia" was seen as neces-
sary to the "security of a free state." 
The idea behind this amendment was 
that it was dangerous for all military 
power to be concentrated in the hands 
of the government. The American 
revolutionaries were able to kick the 
British out only because the general 
population was armed - a lesson not 
lost on the framers of the constitution. 
An armed citizenry, they believed, 
cou Id al ways rise up against a govern-
ment which refused to step down 
through electoral methods. Thus, a 
"free state" could prevail over tyr-
army. 

This line of thinking isnow dated, 
to say the least. The "threat of tyr-
anny" is not high on our list of na-
tional concerns. And even if it were, 
do we rea lly want a public with enough 
fi repower to compete with the mod-

portions. But a waiting period will do 
nothing to stop it. And while it's tragic 
when a child tinds a gun and acciden-
tally shoots himself or someone else, 
gun control isno solution. The answer 
is responsibility on the part of the 
person. However, it would be even 
more tragic if a respon ible parent 
didn ' t have the means to defend the 
child from adangerouscliminal. Guns 
in schools are also tragic. For every 
gun that is brought to school , there is 
a negligent adult who allowed it to 
happen. That's the problem we should 

em military?The days of muskets and 
cannonballs are over. 

Most of the amendments in the 
Bill of Rights have grown even more 
valuable with age. Gun-control oppo-
nents argue that to re-evaluate the 
Second Amendment would make it 
easier for the government to stan ig-
noring the other ones. 

This is not likely. If anything, 
clauses such a~ ''freedom of speech" 
have become broader and more pow-
erful while the Second andThird (quar-
tering of soldiers) Amendments have 
become curious footnotes of the past. 
[t is a credit to the founding fathers 
thatmostoftheamendmentsstill have 
pres ing significance in this day and 
age. 

Whether or not tighter control on 
handguns will reduce the appalling 
crime rates in this country remains 
to be seen. But if an outdmed and 
irrelevant legal clause is all that is 
keeping us from trying, let 's get rid 
of it. Yes, yes - "guns don't kill 
people, people kill people." But 
let 's at least have the killing done 
with kni ves and clubs for a change. 

be dealing with. 
[n fact, gun control could make the 

crime problem worse. Taking away 
law-abiding citizens' ability to de-
fend themselves leaves him 
dependmenton police protection. Law 
enforcement has been overwhelmed 
for some time, even in ordinary cir-
cumstances. We have seen that even 
the National Guard can 't quickly con-
trol civil unrest. Unril crime has been 
controlled, it' s senseless to leave 
people defenseless. 

The handgun control legislation 
just passed will prove ineffective in 
cutting violence and will intrude on 
individuals' lives.

WRC IS VITAL TO UNIVERSITY 
Editor: 

1 would like to respond to the Nov. 
29 letter from Ed Wagnerwhichques-
tioned the validity of funding the 
Women's Resource Center. I am 
deeply saddened and outraged that 
this kind of mi understanding about 
the function and pu rpose of a women 's 
center is so prevalent on this campus. 

Mr. Wagner a ks, "What is so 
damned horrible about being a woman 
that [we] need a paid staff member?" 
Well, traditionally in American soci-
ety, women have been denied equal 
treatmen!. For instance, how many 
woman authors have you read in all 
the years you attended school? And 
while women consist of 5 I percent of 
the tudent body, how many women 
are tenured professors? And why can't 
n woman walk the streets alone at 
night, free of the threat of rape and 
harassment? These are the questions 
you should ask before questioning the 
need for a women's center. 

A women's center exists to try to 
right these wrongs. Women's centers 
offer services to both men and women 
to facilitate better understanding of 
male-femaledynamics in society. The 
WRC provides many crucial services 
not available elsewhere on campus. 
For example, the WRC has informa-
tion on hundreds of support and edu-
cational groups - in areas such a~ 
sexual harassmentanddiscrimination, 
rape and domestic violence - and 
provides a meeting place for many 
others. 

The WRC does not serve "to con-
sole someone who has the tragic mis-
fortune ofbeing a woman," but seeks 
to make al l women proud of who they 
are and to realize their full potential. It

whUlthe WRC,orthe women' s move-

The reason why there is no men'~

the power in society. This is a fact. 
One need only to look at history books 
and government officials to see this. 
A women 's center seeks to right this 
imbalance. 

If till unconvinced aboutthe need 
for a women 's center, consider the 
fact that every majoruni versity inthis 
country has a fully funded women' . 
center. Except us. It is obvious that

CULTS: UCSD 
alumnus draws on 
experiences for book 
Continued from page 1 
haven' t fo und in conventional re-
ligion . Laxer said he found the 
cult attractive because hi s friends 
were in it and its teachings were 
psychologicall y enticing, openi ng 
up a new world of thinking. 

" It's a project, a community of 
people wi th similar ideals. They 
were a group of wonderful people. 
Also, Lenz's leachings on the 
mystici sm of Eastern philosophies 
like Zen Buddhism, Hindui m and 
Taoism and their interrelating with 
American culture inlrigued me," 
he said. 

Laxer' s book al so emphasizes 
the negative consequences that 
result from joining such a cult. 

According to Laxer, as Lenz 
rose to power as a cult leader, he 
"went crazy" and started giving 
his followers drugs like LSD. He 
also began issuing ultimatums. 

Laxer contends that leavi ng a 
cul t is at least as complex as join-
ing one. 

"I tried to leave when [Lenz] 
rose to power, and he pulled a 
numberon me [with the drugs] . In 
the back of my mind, I had always 
wanted to leave, but never had the 
momenlum to do so," he said. 

Laxer said he realized the cu lt 
was not what he was looking for 
when it became involved in drugs. 
"[LenzI gave me LSD in 1984. It's 
prelly damn powerful. My ego and 
senseofselfhad been built upover 

the years, like layers, and LSD had 
the effect of stripping all the layers 
off and leaving me bare. It had the 
effect of knocking down my se lf-
conti dence." Laxer said . 

"On top of that, [LenzI was 
con vi nc i ng mem be l'S that they 
were mentally ill. One of the mem-
bers committed suicide, and I 
talked to his parents even Ihough 
Lenz told me not to . 1 ti nall y had to 
take a s tep bilck and ask. 'What's 
all til is bullshit?'" 

The la~ t chapter in Laxe r'~ 
book, "The Las t upper." de-
scribes how he finally confronted 
Lenz and the inner circle of cult 
members with his decision to leave 
the cull. 

Laxer said that cults are not 
easily identitiuble. ··Culls nowa-
days are masked by respectabil-
ity .. . members have Ph .D.s, wear 
nice clothes - all thi s subtle 
stuff. Lenz right now is all over the 
place. Newsweek calls him tile 
'yuppie guru,'" Laxer added. 

According to Laxer, Lenz is 
now earning from $8 to 10 million 
ayear. His core following consists 
of women and computer engi neers. 

"He takes people like me and 
takes them to computer school, 
and the money you earn goes to 
him," Laxter said . 

"He is current ly at the Univer-
sityofToronto, recruiting women. 
He is looking for 'young, innocenl 
things. ' I get a lot of call s from 
freaked-out parents, suying, 'What 
do we do? My daughter has bro-
ken a ll cont;lct with us: It ·s pretty 
scary s tutT." 

Laxer"s biggest concern is to 

warn yo ung people against poten-
tiul cult leaders. 

"The problem with cult le<ld-
ers is that many of Ihem are clean. 
You have to wke each one as an 
individual. 

"Even though it seems that you 
start out with a fi ne leader, you 
should step back and ask your~clf 
if it reall y is right. You wo n' t 
know when someone close to you 
will ~ uddenl y go insane. If they 
give you ultimatums. you ~houl d 
leave," he ~a ld . 

Even though Laxer ai m~ hi ~ 
message ar present cult member-; 
or t ho~e th inking about joini ng 
one. he said that his fi c tion-like 

~ ty l e should enable any interested 
reader 10 empath ize with his expe-
riences. 

"My book isan adventure~lOry , 
not an anti -cult book. It is very 
di fficult to warn people ... there are 
not too many books in fic tion 10 
take a person to the core of a cult 
and experience it vicariously ,'· 
Laxer said. 

He added that though cults on 
college campuses today are low-
protile, they are more popular among 
students than the public knows. 

The administration, he said, 
should be aware of how these 
groups operate, especially the ways 
in which they use campus clubs as 
front organizations. 

"If the administration doesn' t 
care, then young people al Ur'SD 
and college campuses around the 
country will continue to be re-
cruited by very malevolent cult 
groups. It 's endemic in our sys-
Il!m; ' he said.

COMPUTER-AIDED METHODS 
IN ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS 

In the last decade, there has been an explosion in the use 
of computers as tools for a variety of analyses of data , both 

for descriptive statistics as well as for financial analyses. 
Computers have become such an integral part of today's data 
manipulation that it is essential that every major in Economics 

and QEDS be adequately trained in their use. Econ 60 is 
designed to fill this need with a particular emphasis on 

spreadsheets. Applications will make use of both 
mainframe and micro computers.

R<lrely c<ln a team in any spon say that it 

has participated in 10 Final Fours in 13 
years. The UCSD women's volleyball squad 
can. 

The Triton, finished fourth in the nation 
in CAA Divi,ion III and tallied an impres. 
sivc 24- 11 rccord during the 1993 ,ea,on. 

UCSDopened theyearwi th three straight 
lo,ses. It then crushed nine of its next 10 
opponent,. 

The match of the year came halfway 
through the season when the Triton, hosted 
the Mizuno Invitational. Among the partici-
pant, was Washington Univer,ity in SI. 
Louis, the country's number-one ranked 
DiVISion III team and two-time defending 
nutional <.:ha1l1pion. D entcred the seu-
~on with six nationaltitlel> In 12 years. 

In livc unforgettable set" the Hews held 
off II Triton match pOints and eventually 
won in amazing come-from-bchind fashion 
to maintain their number-onc r:l1lking. 

Aft.:r letting that one sl ip through its 
lingers, UCSD didn' t lose another match 
dunng the regular season, wi nning its next 
I I matdlCl> to entcr the playo tTs with a 21-9 
1l1ar~ . 

The liN three roundsol post-season com-
pel1llon were a breelc for the Tritons. They 
plowed their way through Pomona-Pitzer, 
College of St. Bencdict\ and lan:mont-
Mudd-Scripp, to advance to thei r 10th Final 
Four. 

Everyone anticipated a rematch between 
an Diego and Wa, hington in the IMiomd 

linals. The Bears li ved up to their end of the 
bargain. bUlthe Tritons didn 't. 

In the ~e 111itinab UCSD'~ ~eason ended 
r~thcr abruptly when host Juniata Collt:ge

Rough Waters 
The Triton men's water polo team en-

countered rough waterS and a violent sea of 
wonhy opponents in its 1993 seasonal cam-
paign. 

inth-ranked UCSD ( 19- 11 ) ~ Iipped to 
eighth in a tield of eight at the NCAA 

ation;]1 Water Polo Championships, break-

place fi nis h e~. 

" We really wanted to do someth ing that 
we' ve ncver done," Triton Head Co;]ch 
Denny Hilrper said, in reference to winning 
the fifth-place game. "Unfortunately, we 
went the wrong way." 

UCSD devoured its Wes tern Water Polo 
As,ociation Conference (WWPA) foes all 
year long, but fai led to upset a top- I 0 ~c hoo l 
th is season. Nevenheles" no team in the 
nation cou ld take the Triton offensive ma-
chine for granted. 

Long Beach tate, ranked ninth in the 
nmion at the time, bare ly topped San Diego. 
9-8, on Sept. 17, and second-ranked Cal 
needed a fourth-quaner flurry to top the

DC San Diego Pace Setters 
Despite a run of injuries that 

riddled both the men ' s and women' 5 
cross coumry teams in 1993, Tri ton 
Head Coach Ted Van Arsdale guided 
both squads back to the Division III 
elite NCAA National Champion-
ships in Grinnell, Iowa. 

"The complexion of the team 
from the very beginning of the year 
was completely different than the 
one weended up with," Van Arsdale 
said. 

"The athletes were able to handle 
the switch very well. That's an at-
tribute to their flexibility and matu-
rity," he added. "Only 21 teams com-
pete atthc nationalleve!. Atthe last 
meet of the year, they were there." 

Junior Karen Hinkle's43rd place 
in the women's five-kilometer race 
( 18:46,2) paced the lady Tritons to 
an 11th-place team fini sh overall. 

Chandra Boydstun (64th, 
18:58.5), freshman Hilary Ferreira 
(87th, 19: 11.9), Jessie Therriault 
(94th, 19:17.4), Laura Peck ( 123rd, 
19:38.8), Jane Zimmerman (147th, 
20:06.5) and Sara Lyn Ruffalo 
( I 70th, 20:42.5) rounded out the 
scoring for UCSD. 

" Every race they found out what 
theircapabilities were," Van Arsdale 
said. 

U. Castner barely missed AII -
American qualification, finishing 
33rd (25:47.7) for the men 's eight-
kilometer national contingent. 

Bryan Leek (84th, 26:25,6), 
Walter Dehority (IOlst, 26:36.3), 
Scott Leon ( I 07th, 26:40.7), John 
Walsh (113th, 26:42.9), Eri ck 
Goldman ( I 24th, 26:50.5) and Matt 
Ringer (140th, 27:05.8) each made 
major strides in the Triton men's 
14th-place tally. 

"Our guys had a 101 of inexperi -
ence, but I think it was a good effon 
on their pan," Van Arsdale said. 

"I am very pleased with the sea-
son we had," he praised . "Both 
squads return fi ve of the seven top 
runners next year."

LARI PITTMAN 
Paintings and Works on Paper, 1989-1993 

Excess, embellishment and chaos all contribute to the curiosity and confusion one feels when gazing at any of Lari Pittman's paintings. In the last 
decade, Pittman, an artist from Los Angeles, has become 
well known for his exuberant compositions and the hallu- I 
cinogenic atmosphere they create. "Lari Pittman: Paint-
ings and Works on Paper, 1989-1993" is currently on 
display at the Mandeville G?lIery. 

Onto one panel or piece of paper, Pittman throws 
together an array of images, words, numbers, colors and 

symbols, providinga visual maze which may or may not tel l 
a coherent story. While it re embles surreali st art in some 
ways, Pittman 's work ultimately fall . short of that style 
because of its utter saturation of detail and design. His 
paintings bombard the viewer with information expre~~ed 
with superfluity, rather than with eloquence. 

Pittman obviously intends to overwhelm his audien e 
with exce sive imagery. The challenge in viewing his 
paintings is to decipher the essential subject muller. One of

FILM 

A Perfect World 
Kevin Costner plays a complex villain in Clint E~twood's film 

By Mike Martinez 
Contributing Writer 

In a perfect world, so to speak, 
Butch Haynes would never have 
been abandoned by his father - an 
event which led to his rebellion 
against society. In a perfect world, 
he would never have received an 
unusually harsh sentence for his 
first offense as ajuvenile, nor would 
he subsequently have learned the 
~kill s of a criminal while in prison. 

Clint Eastwood doesn't usually 
make films about perfect worlds, 
and A Perfecr World is no excep-
tion. His protagonists are usually 
world·weary men with a past -
iconoclastic loners like Harry 
Callahan or soaring, flawed gems 
like Charlie Parker. In his follow-
up to the Oscar-winning 
Unforgiven, director Eastwood tells 
a story in which some of the good 
guys have a little bad in them, and 
the villain is the most complex 
figure of al I.

As portrayed by Kevin Costner, 
Butch Haynes is part gentleman, 
part feral beast, with the honed 
instincts of an outlaw. He breaks 
out of prison aided by a sadistic 
fellow inmate, Terry Pugh (Keith 
Szarabajka). It 's apparent that they 
don't like each other - Haynes is 
bright and controlled, Pugh is vio-
lent and brutal.

Haynes (Kevin Costner) and Philip <T,J. Lowther) develop a good rapport on the road. 

The genui ne chemi~t ry between 
Costner and Lowlher carrie~ this 
tilm . The boy i!'. cUle and trusting, 
and his affection for Hayne~ is to-
tally convincing. Tht: affection is 
not of the father/son type, but rather 
like that of liltle Joey for the gun-
tighter with 1I past in the classic 
Western ShallI' . Costner is clearly 
in his prime here, adding sinister 
shadings to his familiar Bull 
Durllalllamiubility. Maybe it's not 
a perfect world , but it is a world 
that shows an 'Ictm growing and a 
director at the top of his game. 

Szarabajka contributes one of 
the few discordant moments in the 
story. When theconvicts takeeigl1t-
year-old Philip Perry (TJ. Lowther) 
hostage, Pugh heaps absurd brutal-
