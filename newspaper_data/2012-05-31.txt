SURF REPORT

BY ZEV HURWITZ
Associate News Editor

Charles Reed, Chancellor of the 
California State University System, 
announced his retirement last week 
pending the appointment of a replace-
ment. Reed, who has led the Cal State 
system since 1998, announced his 
departure in a May 24 email sent to 
CSU faculty and staff.

“It has been 
an incredible 
honor to serve 
as chancellor of 
the California 
State University 
during such a 
dynamic period 
in the univer-
sity’s history,” he 
wrote.  “Over the 
past decade and 

a half, the CSU has emerged as a 
national leader in providing access and 
support to students from a wide range 
of socio-economic backgrounds.”

Over the course of Reed’s ten-
ure, student enrollment increased by 
almost 25 percent. Additionally, Reed 
presided over the establishment of the 
23rd CSU campus at Channel Islands.

Reed received several degrees from 
The George Washington University 
including an Ed.D. in Teacher 
Education. Previously, Reed, 70, head-
ed the State University of Florida sys-
tem from 1985 until 1998.

UC President Mark Yudof released 
a statement May 24 commending his 
CSU-counterpart for the work he 
accomplished during his tenure.

“California owes a deep debt of 
gratitude to Chancellor Reed,” Yudof 
said in the statement. “For close to 
15 years now, he has provided the 
vital California State University sys-
tem with consistently dynamic and 
innovative leadership.”

Reed presided over a challenging 
time for CSU. A series of fee increases 
and over $1 billion budget cuts have 
made it difficult to manage the sys-
tem. When Reed took office in 1998, 
tuition on CSU campuses was around 
$1,500. An increase announced in 
November brought tuition to nearly 
$6,000.

SENATOR PROPOSES CAP ON 
NONRESIDENT STUDENTS

SEN. MICHAEL J. RUBIO’S PLAN WOULD IMPLEMENT A 10 PERCENT CAP ON OUT-OF-
STATE AND INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS. BY NICOLE CHAN • ASSOCIATE NEWS EDITOR

UC SYSTEM

A California senator proposes to cap out-of-state and inter-national student enrollment 
at all ten UC campuses in a measure 
designed to give California students 
a “fair shot” at attending public state 
universities. 

Sen. Michael J. Rubio (D-Shafter) 
presented the Senate Constitutional 
Amendment 22 on May 16. The 
measure, if passed into legislation, 

would establish a 10 percent cap on 
undergraduate enrollment of out-of-
state and international students for 
Fall 2013. This year, the UC system’s 
undergraduate enrollment totaled 
181,028, with 11,600 out-of-state and 
16,134 international students, or 6.4 
percent and 8.9 percent, respectively.   

“SCA 22 ensures that California 
students get a fair shot at attending 
our University of California system 

— and not be turned away simply 
because a wealthy student from the 
East Coast or abroad shows up with 
checkbook in hand,” Rubio said in a 
May 16 press release.

The measure has already drawn 
criticism from UC representatives. In 
a May 24 message from UC Berkeley 
Chancellor Robert Birgeneau, he 
states the importance of out of state 
and international students to the 

educational experience of California 
students and to the campus’ revenue 
stream. Out-of-state and internation-
al students composed 18 percent of 
the 25,885 undergraduate students 
enrolled at UC Berkeley this year. 
Specifically, 2,374 non-California 
students and 2,423 international stu-
dents were admitted.

Staff Writer

UCSD scientists have created the 
first malaria vaccine out of algae, a 
development that could make treat-
ment affordable and accessible for 
the two billion individuals world-
wide affected by the disease. 

According to San Diego Center 
for Algae Biotechnology Director 
Stephen Mayfield, graduate student 
Miller Tran pointed out the advan-
tages of working with algae to create 
proteins that could be used to vac-
cinate malaria, such as the ability to 
fold complex proteins. 

Tran proposed using algae 
because it is less expensive to pro-
duce than the bacterias and cells 
used to create vaccines. It is a differ-
ent way to create proteins that have 
not been used before. 

“We’ve always thought about 
making vaccines because they’re 
very expensive,” Mayfield said. “The 
main strength of algae is that you 
can grow this stuff at very large scale 

for really cheap because it’s essen-
tially a crop.” 

More specifically, Mayfield’s lab 
works with algae and its use as an 
alternative resource. Mayfield said 
that the UCSD lab is one of the only 
facilities that has the tools to create 
a vaccine for malaria out of algae. 

Mayfield’s team injected the pro-
teins they created from algae into 
mice. The mice then made antibod-
ies, which blocked the production of 
the malaria parasite. The team then 
collaborated with UCSD School of 
Medicine professor Joseph Vinetz, 
who studies malaria. 

Vinetz has mosquitoes that carry 
malaria as part of his research, and 
he injected the proteins Mayfield’s 
lab created into the mosquitoes. The 
proteins successfully blocked the 
malaria parasite from developing 
inside the mosquito.

According to Mayfield, bacteria 
are not good at folding complex 
proteins, which is crucial to the cre-
ation of vaccines, and they put sugar 
on their proteins. Many cells pro-

duce sugars for proteins as they fold 
into their proper shape because the 
sugars help them retain that shape.

However, malaria proteins do 
not use sugar. Another one of the 
problems with bacteria is that the 
proteins in malaria are too complex 
for bacteria to fold. 

Previously, scientists were not 
able to create a vaccine for malaria 
because the cells and bacteria they 
normally use to create vaccines put 
sugar on their proteins. 

To create vaccine malaria, 
Mayfield’s team needed to find a 
way to fold complex proteins with-
out putting sugar on them. 

“Our hypothesis was, algae can 
make complex malaria proteins, fold 
them correctly and not put sugars 
on them,” Mayfield said. “And quite 
often you come up with a wonderful 
hypothesis and you do it and you’re 
dead wrong. But sometimes you’re 
right and in this case we were right.”   

According to Mayfield, the next

meeting at Reed’s office in November 
2011, police arrested several demon-
strators who had attempted to break 
in to disrupt the meeting.   A large-
scale protest had taken place outside 
the office to protest the tuition fee 
increases.

Board of Trustees Chair Bob 
Linscheid praised the chancellor for 
his tenacity during the recent hard 
times for CSU.

“Charlie has persevered through 
the worst budget crisis in the his-
tory of California, and has had to deal 
with deep budget cuts to the CSU,” 
Linscheid said in a May 24 article 
published by the CSU Office of Public

Reed’s replacement will be deter-
mined by the CSU Board of Trustees.

According to the message, UC 
Berkeley is hoping to increase out-
of-state and international students to 
20 percent of the total undergraduate 
enrollment. Birgeneau said Rubio’s 
proposed 10 percent cap would lead 
to a $60 million shortfall that would 
have to be made up by increases in 
student tuition. UC Berkeley admit-
ted 3,759 out of state and interna-
tional students for Fall 2012, down 
from last year’s 4,403. 

Currently, tuition and fees for out-
of-state students at UCSD amounts 
to an annual $36,078 per student. 
Resident students at UCSD pay 

$13,234 in tuition and fees for the 
2011-12 academic year.

According to “UC, UCSD out-
of-state admissions spike,” published 
April 17 in the U-T San Diego, the 
UC system admitted 18,846 nonresi-
dent students for Fall 2012, a 43 per-
cent increase from 2011. 

At UCSD alone, 7,425 nonresi-
dents were admitted for Fall 2012, 
representing a 75 percent increase 
from 2011. According to the UCSD 
Fall 2011 college portrait, out-of-state 
and international students represent-
ed 9.6 percent of total undergradu-
ate enrollment. Of the 23,046 total 
undergraduate enrollment at UCSD 

this year, 697 students were from out 
of state and 1,511 students were from 
out of the country. 

“We’re thrilled UC San Diego con-
tinues to attract many highly quali-
fied and dynamic students,” Assistant 
Vice Chancellor for Admissions and 
Enrollment Services Mae Brown said 
in the U-T San Diego on April 17. 
“Our students have made tremen-
dous contributions to this campus, 
helping to establish UC San Diego as 
a world-renowned, academic pow-
erhouse.”

Things got contentious among 
the A.S. Senators this week as they 
discussed creating new positions and 
the A.S. Human Rights Board as well 
as the new senate appointments.

Members 
of the Student 
Sustainability 
Collective and 
other UCSD 
activists came 
to the meeting 
voicing their 
displeasure with 
the proposal to 
create a  human rights board. Their 
concern is that the board was created 
without consulting relevant members 
of the UCSD activist community.

“It’s really insulting to us as activ-
ists who have been working for years 
to think that there needs to be a 
human rights board in order to do 
the work that we’ve already done,” 
SSC member Cecilia Zhou said.

Other members of the public 
commended the efforts of Campus-
wide Senator Brad Segal and the 
rest of council in their work trying 
to create a human rights board but 
advised them to try to rework their 
idea and take a different approach.

Some senators objected to the 
idea stating that it infringes on the 
role of SSC. The resolution was 
referred back to Rules Committee.

“Overall this is a really good idea, 
and we should really push for it,” 
Warren Senator Nhat-Dang Do said.

All Campus Transfer Association 
gave an end-of-the-year report dis-
cussing the events that they held this 
year such as a Bowl-Off.

“We definitely want to work with 
AS more because we like you guys. 
You give us money,” an ACTA repre-
sentative said.

Shashank Gupta was appointed 

Sixth College Senator with unani-
mous approval.

VP Finance and Resources Bryan 
Cassella gave a report on the A.S. 
budget. He told the council that 

he would only 
be allocating up 
to Week Three, 
this way Council 
could use the 
entire summer to 
think about what 
they wanted to do 
with the rest of 
the academic year 

and make revisions to the budget in 
the fall. He also mentioned that he 
would be attempting to cut down on 
the over allocation system from over 
$150,000 to the traditional $100,000.

“There’s a lot of things that have 
no caps right now and I think that’s 
the target. We need to start working 
on consolidating where the money is 
going,” Cassella said.

AVP of Academics Sammy 
Chang, AVP of Student Orgs 
Pauline Nuth and AVP of Student 
Advocacy Bryce Farrington gave a 
presentation tracing past trends in 
the budget in order to understand 
how to manage the rising costs 
that Council is encountering. They 
believe that they need to create a 
new model as the current one is 
unsustainable, and provide qual-
ity events that demonstrate fiscal 
responsibility for the bigger picture.

Council once again discussed 
consolidating the roles of Speaker 
and Advocate General into one posi-
tion. The resolution to create the 
position eventually failed with a vote 
of 16-10-1. Many members were 
concerned that the position silences 
senators and representatives who 
were appointed and elected in order 
to give their constituents a voice.

step for the team is to create an 
oral version of the vaccine, since 
the method of injecting a vaccine is 
very expensive. 

“There are two billion people 
who are susceptible to [malaria] 
and there’s no way 
we’ll ever afford an 
injectable vaccine,” 
Mayfield said.

Mayfield said 
that he went to Bali 
a few years ago, but 
he needed to first 
get the hepatitis 
vaccine, consisting 
of two injections at 
$115 each. 

He also said that 
the price of the vac-
cine was too expen-
sive for most resi-
dents of the country. 

Many Asian 
countries, such as 
Pakistan and India, 

suffer from malaria because their 
tropical regions attract mosquitoes.

“Well, it’s okay for me and fam-
ily we got [the hepatitis vaccine],” 
Mayfield said. “But nobody in Bali 
can afford that — nobody in Asia 
can afford $230, that’s a third of 
their yearly income.”

Mayfield said that 
his team is spending 
this month injecting 
the mice with their oral 
vaccine. 

They said that they 
will know by July if the 
vaccine is effective.

“If that works, 
instead of having a 
vaccine that costs hun-
dreds of dollars you 
have a vaccine that 
costs one or two pen-
nies,” Mayfield said.

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, MAY 31,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

Last week, our office was abuzz with not-so-relevant bragging — we were boasting about our 
high school’s ratings on U.S. News and 

World Report’s 2012 rankings, which 
had just come out. Part of our staff 
was deeply disappointed by their alma 
mater’s “unranked” status on the list, 
and similarly deeply amused by their 
school’s ranking of 21.8 out of a 100 
for college readiness. Well, we‘re all in 
the same boat now.  

I didn’t care that much — my 
nearly all-white high school ranked 
51 in the state, not bad considering 
our status as the third worst high 
school in our district. Yeah, we were 
really competitive. But what shocked 
my friends back home (who were also 
rehashing the ratings), was Dublin 
High School’s 4th place ranking. 

For my legion of loyal readers 
who are not from the San Francisco 
Bay Area, Dublin High School is 
not exactly the cream of the crop in 
terms of K-12 education. On average, 
15 percent of Dublin High School 
seniors are admitted into the UC 
system, compared with neighboring 
school Monte Vista High (also a 
public school), who had 43 percent. 
Dublin’s drop out rate, according 
to the California Department of 
Education, is 20 percent, surpassing 
the state average of 18 percent and 
far, far surpassing Monte Vista’s zero 
percent. 

So when Dublin High School 
was ranked 4th in the state, nobody 
believed it. It just didn’t register for 
folks in the Dublin Unified School 
District that their little-school-who-
couldn’t did that well. Quickly, they 
figured out the problem — the report 
stated that Dublin had 493 students, 
as opposed to their actual tally of 
1,650 students. Their unbelievable 
student to teacher ratio of 7:1 was just 
that, unbelievable — their real student 
to teacher ratio was 23:1. And most 
importantly, Advanced Placement test 
pass levels were hugely skewed. 

This entire problem was caused by 
a glitch in a system when the district 
switched to a new student data 
reporting system called the California 
Longitudinal Pupil Achievement 
Data System — allegedly, only Dublin 
High School had the mistake of 
misreporting its student population. 
In one single glitch, the school’s 
rankings shocked an entire state. 

Let’s move a little closer to home. 
San Diego High School’s School of 
International Studies received no 
ranking this year unlike previous 
years, solely because their IB testing 
scores went through an incorrect file. 
Again, one glitch — huge problems.

These two schools may be polar 
opposites, but have both suffered 
from the consequences of sloppy 
journalism. Several other schools (in 
the San Diego Union School District, 
no less) have stepped forward to 
correct their school’s incorrect data.

In 1990, California became the first of 15 states to create term limits for its state assembly and 
congress. Prop. 140 limited lawmak-
ers to 14 years total, or three two-year 
terms in the assembly and two four-
year terms in the Senate. Yet, judging 
by the increasingly frequent headlines 
about political deadlock and fiscal 
crisis in recent years, this guideline 
hasn’t exactly led to a harmonious and 
effective group of legislators.

Prop. 28, the first of two statewide 
initiatives on the June 5 ballot, would 
reduce the number of total years 

legislators can serve from 14 to 12 — 
but more importantly, it would allow 
all of these years to be served in one 
house. This allows talented politicians 
to rise to different positions within 
the assembly instead of simply rush-
ing to raise money and press the flesh 
so they can be elected to the senate 
before the term limit is up. 

The major contention of oppo-
nents is strangely semantic: They say 
that the proposition is misleading and 
seems to get rid of term limits, when 
it actually reduces the total time from 
14 to 12 years. Given that this issue of 

marketing is the main concern, and 
that the proposition has the backing 
of Common Cause and League of 
Women Votes, organized labor and 
the chamber of commerce, it’s a good 
bet that Prop. 28 improved current 
term limits and could relieve some of 
the problems plaguing Sacramento. 
While it may be counter-intuitive to 
reduce the total term limit, allowing 
politicians the option to focus on 
serving constituencies and areas — 
instead of focusing on the next fun-
draising campaign — can bring little 
but good.

YES
ON PROP28

Taxing cigarettes to raise money and reduce smoking rates — as Prop. 29 suggests — is a 
good idea in theory. Using the nearly 
$800 million in yearly revenue to cre-
ate a potentially unaccountable grant 
board and out-of-state jobs is a ter-
rible idea in practice.

Prop. 29 would increase the state 
cigarette tax from 87 cents to $1, 
which is still lower than the $1.46 
national average. The problem is 
not with the tax itself, especially as 
these penalties have been shown to 
reduce smoking rates, but with all 
that taxpayer money going toward 
an extremely limited purpose. The 
National Institute of Health already 
spends more research funding on 

cancer than any other disease, and 
other smoking-related illness like 
heart and lung disease top their list of 
priorities as well. There’s little need to 
create a state commission to replicate 
the NIH’s work, and even less need to 
provide said commission with money 
that circumvents an existing proposi-
tion which guarantees a share of all 
state funding for education. This new 
state commission would not be able to 
funnel a single cent of that $800 mil-
lion toward schools — but the nine-
member commission could spend the 
money on rent, consultants and travel. 

Not to mention that the board 
in charge of spending this money 
includes top researchers, but nobody 
who will represent the public’s wishes 

in how their taxpayer money in spent. 
There are no guidelines preventing 
the money from funding out-of-state 
research and jobs elsewhere, and the 
narrow focus ignores the fact that 
California’s major problems include 
lack of funding for education and 
public services. Former California 
Board of Education Executive 
Director Tom Bogetich contends that 
Prop. 29 will direct money away from 
our schools, and thus shortchange our 
greatest prioritize. He’s right: When 
the state government can barely afford 
to keep K-12 open, we need to priori-
tize education and have tax money go 
to schools, not to out-of-state research 
that could be covered by national 
organizations. 

Proposition A, or the “San Diego Ban on Project-Labor Agreements Initiative,” asks 
that the city be more transparent with 
construction projects, and increase 
contractor competition for these 
projects to drive down prices. The 
initiative achieves this by not requir-
ing all contracts to be a Project Labor 
Agreement for city construction 
projects, unless otherwise mandated 
by the state or federal law in order to 
receive their funding. This is a propo-

sition that opens up fair competition 
by allowing non-union construction 
workers to compete on even ground 
with unionized to be hired for a proj-
ect — currently, PLAs favor unionized 
workers. When contractors openly 
compete for projects, the price of the 
project generally decreases by 13 to 
15 percent, according to supporters 
in the official ballot pamphlet. The 
opposition states that this proposition 
may jeopardize the amount of fund-
ing the city of San Diego may receive 

from the state since the city will be 
doing projects more independently. 
However, a look at the language of the 
bill shows that it addresses that if state 
or federal funding depends on San 
Diego having a PLA, then the city will 
abide by the requirement.  

Finally, the proposition asks for 
the city to post all details and bidders 
for construction projects online to 
increase transparency — something 
that all government should be work-
ing towards.

The “San Diego Pension Reform Initiative,” otherwise known as Proposition B, aims to make 
the maximum pension 80 percent 
of the worker’s salary, instead of the 
current 90 percent, saving a projected 
$141 million over the next five years. 
Under the proposition, San Diego 
employee’s pensions will move to a 
401(k) plan and city officials would be 
urged to impose a five-year freeze on 
pension pay for city employees. 

Voters should support the propo-
sition because it will keep pensions 
reasonable and affordable for the city. 
According to opponents of the bill, 
the pension reform will cost the city 
$54 million to pay off actuarial liabili-
ties on an accelerated schedule for the 
first three years. But this bill will save 
money for the city in the long run, 
and while changes in the system will 
initially cause San Diego to pay it for-
ward, the savings could be in the bil-

lions by 2040. Also, the pension reduc-
tion is reasonable for workers, because 
the idea that city employees are paid 
less than the private sector is no lon-
ger the case. According to the Union 
Tribune, when job compensation 
in the public and private sectors are 
compared, public salaries often come 
out significantly on top. Therefore 
Proposition B will move towards a 
more standardized and fair system of 
public employee compensation.

and new Chargers stadium. But more 
importantly, he is the only mayoral 
candidate to support the November 
tax hike. When we set forth in our 
research, we stacked our priorities 
according to the issues that concerned 
us the most, and in the end, education 
topped the list. More specifically, we 
support Gov. Jerry Brown’s November 
tax initiative that would raise sales 
taxes and income taxes on citizens 
who earn more than $250,000 annu-
ally. If voters vote down the tax, it 
would trigger $5.5 billion in cuts from 
K-12 schools and $500 million in cuts 
from state colleges. 

Admittedly, Filner’s education 
plan largely focuses on less important 
factors, including a before-and-after 
school program and free transporta-
tion for students (despite the fact that 
fares for students are already reduced 
by 50 percent). However, we contend 
that schools are better off with actual 
funding from the state (what Filner’s 
positive November tax initiative vote 
would help ensure) as opposed to a 
scarcely funded, albeit structured edu-
cation plan. 

Dumanis was a clear second 
choice — she is the candidate with the 
strongest K-12 education plan. She 
advocates a strong mayoral presence 
in city schooling and intends to cre-
ate four mayoral appointed members 
of the school board, and a special 
department that would oversee school 
district finances. But despite this 
solid plan, Dumanis has no way of 

funding her plans except through the 
“rearrangement” of funding in City 
Hall. Most importantly, she opposes 
the November tax hike, which would 
cause $30 million in cuts to the San 
Diego School District in the middle of 
the school year. And without funding 
(or a place to attain funding), none 
of Dumanis’ lofty plans are likely to 
pan out.

Republican and Independent 
candidates Carl DeMaio and Nathan 
Fletcher, respectively, rounded out our 
list due to their perceived shortcom-
ings. DeMaio, as the most stringent 
conservative in the race, shows a defi-
nite lack of support for unions (teach-
er unions included), an aspect of 
labor negotiations that we steadfastly 
support. Further, his plan to devote all 
new tax revenues to pothole repairs (a 
major sticking point of his campaign) 
seems to us to be a case of misplaced 
priorities and funding. 

Fletcher, who recently shunned 
his Republican affiliation for an 
Independent party label after a lack 
of support from the party, intrigued 
us with his self-label as an innovator 
and his self-label as the sole bipar-
tisan candidate. But his educational 
plan focuses solely on creating at 
philanthropic foundation that would 
raise money to fund his lofty plans 
of providing technology to every stu-
dent. While that is all well and good, 
Fletcher does not know exactly how 
much his plan would need, or how 
much his foundation could raise. And 
above all, what the San Diego Union 

School District (projected to operate 
with a $118-million deficit in 2012-
13) needs is steady funding, some-
thing Fletcher will likely be unable to 
provide. 

Currently, the polls as of late May 
show DeMaio in the lead with 24 per-
cent of the vote, Filner in second with 
20 percent of the vote. Fletcher and 
Dumanis trail with 10 percent each 
— the additional 35 percent of voters 
are undecided, according to the San 
Diego Union Tribune. If a candidate 
does not win with 50-plus percent of 
the vote in the June 5 primaries, the 
top two candidates will battle it out in 
the November elections. 

To us, Filner is the most progres-
sive choice in a mayoral race rife with 
Republicans (and former Republicans) 
trying to differentiate themselves from 
each other. If Filner wins, he would be 
San Diego’s first Democratic mayor 
in 20 years, a clear partisan shift in a 
city that is moving towards a liberal 
majority. Given that the June prima-
ries around the corner seem unlikely 
to yield a decisive victor, the battle 
over the mayoral will likely rage on 
this summer. 

Dear Editor,
Nikolai Smith’s claim (see May 17 

letter) that Israel is the aggressor in 
its conflict with Palestinians doesn’t 
comport with the historical facts. 
When Israel’s first Prime Minister, 
David Ben-Gurion, announced 
the creation of Israel in 1948 in 
concordance with the UN’s resolu-
tion to partition the disputed land 
between the Jordan River and the 
Mediterranean Sea into a Jewish and 
an Arab state, he also proclaimed 
that the new nation “extends a hand 
to all neighboring states and their 
peoples in an offer of peace and good 
neighborliness.”  

Unfortunately Palestinians did 
not embrace Israel’s peace gesture nor 
the opportunity to create their own 
sovereign nation in the land allocated 
to them. Instead they maintained 
their long-standing, uncompromis-
ing opposition to any manifestation 
of sovereign rights for Jews in any 
part of the historic Jewish homeland. 
Joined by five Arab countries they 
launched a bloody but unsuccessful 
aggression openly aimed at snuffing 
out the nascent Jewish state. For the 
next 19 years (1948-67), though the 
West Bank and Gaza remained under 
Arab control, the Palestinians still 
made no effort to establish their own 
state, using those territories instead 
to launch a relentless campaign of 
terrorism against Israel. This debunks 
any notion that Palestinian terror-
ism is a reaction to the occupation of 
Gaza and the West Bank which Israel 
eventually captured in 1967 during a 
defensive war forced upon her. 

Since 1967 Israel has been seek-
ing a genuine peace agreement with 
Palestinians that would allow it to 
withdraw from territories it captured. 
Almost immediately upon capturing 

the territories, and before a single 
settlement was built on them, Israel 
signaled its willingness to hand land 
back in return for a sincere peace. 
The Arabs, having met in Khartoum, 
Sudan, responded with the famous 
Khartoum declaration of 1967, “No 
Peace with Israel, no negotiations 
with Israel, no recognition of Israel.” 
Breaking with that position in 1977, 
Egyptian leader, Anwar Sadat boldly 
announced his *969willingness to 
peacefully co-existence with Israel. 
Within months Israel signed a his-
toric peace treaty with Egypt and 
returned to it the vast, oil-rich Sinai 
Peninsula that it had captured in the 
1967 war. This underscores Israel’s 
willingness to make sacrifices for 
peace. In contrast, the Palestinians 
have rejected all Israeli initiatives to 
withdraw in return for peace and 
instead launched a heinous terror 
campaign of suicide bombings that 
murdered over 1,000 Israeli civilians 
from 2000-05. During the height 
of that bloody terror campaign, the 
Israeli government acquiesced to the 
demand of its citizens that it build a 
security barrier to protect them from 
Palestinian terrorists. 

In 2005 Israel made a bold uni-
lateral peace gesture by withdrawing 
its forces and all Jewish settlements 
from Gaza. But instead of inspiring 
Palestinians to reconcile with Israel, 
as hoped, they became militantly 
emboldened. They voted into power 
the radically militant terrorist organi-
zation ‘Hamas,’ which then violently 
eliminated more moderate political 
groups, discontinued elections and 
heavily intensified an ongoing cam-
paign of indiscriminate rocket attacks 
on Israeli towns that has provoked 
Israel to respond to protect its citi-
zens.

E veryone in America watches “America’s Got Talent”...right? Well, that’s what the ratings 
usually show. But that could soon 
not be the case:  It’s the seventh 
season now and the departure of 

Piers Morgan marks the departure 
of the only sane judge on the origi-
nal roster. 

Howard Stern as a replacement? 
I mean, I get the fact that Howie 
Mandel is supposed to be funny, 
and I guess (believe it or not) 
Sharon Osbourne has some sort of 
eye for talent as a music manager 
in her previous life….but Howard 
Stern?  It’s mind boggling how a 
raunchy talk show host/fake author 
would have any sort of credential in 
judging talent.

In previous seasons, Piers 
Morgan acted as the levelheaded 
judge, setting the tables straight 
when Osbourne and Mandel got a 
bit too preposterous in who they 
were letting pass. As a journalist, 
Morgan brought some actual criti-
cal thinking to the table, and it’s a 
bit unnerving to see Howard Stern 
fail at that. 

Example: In the last segment 
of the New York Auditions, street 
dancer Stepz gave an audition that 
was completely fresh, combining 
contortionism with a style of danc-
ing called “popping”. Obviously this 
was the best showcase of talent seen 
throughout the entire night, except, 
not only did Howard Stern refuse 
to acknowledge that the guy has 
talent, he also voted against him 
under the pretense that he didn’t 
believe that “this is the type of act 
people will pay for.” 

Really? Does the show have a 
history of welcoming good contor-
tionists? Yup. Does the show have a 
history of welcoming good dancers? 
Yup. But when you combine the 
two to create something completely 
fresh and jaw-dropping, Howard 
Stern doesn’t think so. 

Okay, fine. As long as you’re 
consistent, right? But of course! 
Stern thinks that the next act, a 
group of buff men who take off 
their shirts and touch themselves, 
not only has unique talent, but will 
in fact bring in the paying audi-
ences. 

The show’s emphasis now seems 
to be showcasing the auditions 
that are horrible and provocative 
instead of showcasing actual talent. 
With every episode the viewers will 
probably get to see two to three 
performers with any semblance of 
talent, and then another seven to 
eight performers with absolutely no 
talent at all. I get the fact that there 
is some draw in mocking the losers 
who can’t sing, dance or do whatev-
er strange thing they think will be 
marketable, but this excessiveness 
completely defeats the purpose of 
the show. This, combined with the 
aggressive and ubiquitous Snapple 
product placement makes watch-

If his name sounds familiar, maybe you’ve seen David Miano play live somewhere 
in San Diego with his new-wave/
garage revival band Cut. Or per-
haps you’ve heard of his indie 
record label Aural Gravy — home 
to local acts the Very, the New 
Kinetics and Kelsea 
Little. 

But most likely, 
he was your history 
professor. 

“I have my day job 
and I have my night 
job,” Miano told the 
Guardian in an inter-
view Tuesday. “I teach 
history — ancient his-
tory is my forte —  and then on the 
side I write music and work on my 
label and go see local bands play.”

Miano attended UCSD for 
graduate school, receiving his Ph.D. 
in 2006. Since then, he’s worked as 
a lecturer for upper division history 
courses at the school, while devel-
oping his brainchild, Aural Gravy 
Records.

“Originally the idea was to just 
form the label as a pet project to 
release my own material,” Miano 
said. “I became interested in other 
people’s music, and I ended up put-
ting out three records before I even 
put out my own. As a matter of fact 
I’m still working on mine [laughs].”

The three artists on Aural Gravy 
(four, including Cut) sample from 

a variety of contemporary genre 
trends — an aspect of modern 
music that Miano is particularly 
attracted to. 

“We’re kind of in the indie/
alternative genre — if those words 
even mean anything these days — 
but there is some diversity,” Miano 

said. “Kelsea Little is 
sort of indie folk pop, 
and the New Kinetics 
are garage rock and the 
Very is sort of, like, a 
post-punk retro new-
wave kind of thing.”

This Saturday, Aural 
Gravy’s first annual 
Sonic Indie Music 
Expo will aim to com-

bine the experience of the local 
concertgoer and that of the deal-
hungry vinyl collector into one 
day-long festival. It’s an obvious 
merger for Miano, and one that he 
believes isn’t utilized enough. 

“We just wanted to bring togeth-
er two elements that are related 
to music: the record show, which 
is going to have a bunch of vinyl 
records, CDs, music memorabilia 
and collectibles and all that, paired 
with a really big concert,” Miano 
said. “We have eight bands playing 
throughout the course of the day 
on Saturday, and they’re all really, 
really good. They’re not super well 
known yet, but they’re definitely

ing this season a rather unpleasant 
experience. You know it has to be 
bad when you find yourself focus-
ing on the awkwardly gigantic 
Snapple thermoses next to each 
judge, instead of the act itself. 

What’s happening to “America’s 
Got Talent” has been seen before in 
other reality shows like “American 
Idol.” With the gradual departure 
of original judges Paula Abdul and 
Simon Cowell, ratings for the show 

have been waning every single sea-
son, with the latest finale dropping 
about 32 percent from that of last 
year. I honestly don’t think I can 
recall any “American Idol” contes-
tants since Kris Allen and Adam 
Lambert, and that was three years 
ago. If the producers of “America’s 
Got Talent” don’t find a suitable 
replacement for Piers Morgan soon, 
I really think that this show will 
go down the same path  — which 
is a shame because America does 
indeed have talent.

up-and-coming bands that you’re 
going to be hearing a lot about in 
the future.” 

The festival’s roster (hand-
picked by Miano) will of course 
include the artists signed to Aural 
Gravy, as well as Los Angeles’ the 
New Limb, Bullet & Snowfox, the 
Colourist and more. The record 
expo portion of the event will fea-
ture sales booths from a variety of 
local record stores and sellers — a 
feature that can be attributed to 
Miano’s inherent love for the rare, 
dusty treasures of the past. 

“The great thing about actually 
having a hard copy of record is that 
you have something that you can 
hold,” Miano said. “I suppose it’s 
kind of like the difference between 
reading a book and then getting 
it on your Nook. Especially with 
vinyl, you actually have this record 
and it’s grooved right into the mate-
rial and you can play it. There’s 
something romantic about it, there’s 
something more real about it, and 
also it’s supportive of the bands 
who make them. You can illegally 
download all these free songs on 
the Internet, but if you really love 
a band and you want to support 

them, you’re going to buy the hard 
product.”

As for Miano, his first album 
with Cut is coming soon — out on 
Aural Gravy.

“It’s just me and one other guy 
named Ben Medeiros,” Miano said. 
“He plays drums and I kind of play 
everything else. We’re putting the 
record together now and it should 
be done in maybe about a month 
or two.”

ALBUM REVIEWS

O ne of the more interesting figures to emerge out of last year’s DIY hip-hop renais-
sance, Azealia Banks has fallen out 
of the spotlight almost as quickly as 
she entered it. After a string of excel-
lent singles late last year (including 
the monumental “212”), Banks has 
spent the last few months engaged in 
well-documented Twitter feuds and 
seemingly little else. The 1991 EP, 
released digitally this week, breaks 
this period of inactivity with charac-

teristic bombast. In spite of its short 
runtime (just over fifteen minutes) 
and relative lack of commercial 
promotion, 1991 is nothing short of 
monumental.

Two of 1991’s four tracks, the 
aforementioned “212” and the 
sprightly, shuffling “Liquorice,” 
were released at the end of last year. 
Upon relistening, it’s clear that time 
hasn’t rendered those songs any less 
potent: moments like “212”’s bridge, 
which features Azealia chanting, “I’m 
gonna ruin you, cunt” over escalat-
ing electro-house synths, resonate 
just as vividly as they did upon first 
release. 

The EP’s new tracks, both pro-
duced by stylistically restless New 
York experimental dance maven 
Machinedrum, are similarly power-
ful. The title track, with Azealia’s 
aggressive, rapidly-delivered rhymes 
and Machinedrum’s minimalist, 
melodically-charged backing track, 

settles on a breezy early ‘90’s house 
vibe that suits Banks delightfully. 
The EP’s most surprising moment, 
however, is the latter half of “Van 
Vogue,” which finds Azealia’s voice 
pitched-down and without accompa-
niment, stretching the ultra-baritone 
choruses recently employed by rap-
pers like A$AP Rocky to a stark, jar-
ring extreme. 

This moment, which is rather 
risky in light of Azealia’s position 
as a quasi-mainstream artist, is a 
reaffirmation of the qualities that 
made her so intriguing in the first 
place: Banks is the kind of artist that 
is both exceptionally talented and 
unafraid to take risks. While it may 
be some time before she dethrones 
Missy Elliott, 1991 proves that Banks 
is one of the best rappers around 
today, regardless of gender.

I t’s fun to play cowboy. That’s why the Mystery Jets holed up in Austin, Texas for months in a 
wooden house on the banks of the 
Colorado River to write and record 
their fourth album, Radlands. 

After recording three records 

on Eel Pie Island in Twickenham, 
London, the English five-piece decid-
ed they needed to cross the pond and 
experience the West for themselves. 
The result: a hybrid of Brit-pop and 
western Americana, which, remark-
ably, isn’t as disjointed and terrible as 
it sounds.

“Greatest Hits” starts the album 
with lead man Blaine Harrison 
mumbling about ‘idiots on the BBC’ 
before diving straight into a simple, 
breezy guitar line reminiscent of the 
Eagles and a poppy melody with a bit 
of attitude (think early Beatles meets 
Arctic Monkeys).

“Lonestar” is most heavily influ-
enced by the band’s bucolic sur-
roundings, with some light honky 

tonk picking paired with a soft 
chorus and homely triangle chimes. 
“Sister Everett,” inspired by the band’s 
meeting with a Mormon missionary 
on an airplane, begins with glistening 
church organ, and then rolls, full-
force, into classic Brit rock territory 
— a new rugged sound that the band 
rocks with startling confidence.

Although bassist Kai Fish jumped 
ship just before the release of 
Radlands, the album sounds amaz-
ingly carefree and poppy for a band 
on the brink of a breakup. Leave it to 
a stint in the Wild West to soothe the 
restless soul.

Xiu Xiu has been releasing subversive avant-garde pop for the last decade. 
On albums like 2004’s Fabulous Muscles, Xiu Xiu paired rambunctious 
electro-pop with Stewart’s vivid, often depressing lyrics to wonderful e¥ect. 
Most recently, the band released Always, an album of relatively restrained, 
delicate art rock. This Saturday, the duo plays at North Park’s Soda Bar. 
Canadian prog-metal eccentrics Yamantaka // Sonic Titan open. (AW)

HOSPITALITY
THE SODA BAR/ JUNE 4, 8:30 P.M. / $8

Hospitality’s self-titled 2012 debut album 
was produced by Vampire Weekend 
producer Shane Stoneback, which should 
come as no surprise: Hospitality’s chiming 
guitars, breezy percussion and honest 
lyrical depiction of twenty-something 
life place them firmly in the tradition of 
summer-ready indie bands like Vampire 
Weekend, Ra Ra Riot and Local Natives. 
Songs like “Liberal Arts” and standout 
“Friends of Friends” are fun and e¥ortless, 
and their show next Monday should be a 
great way to kick o¥ the summer. (AW)

S outhern hip-hop is in a recession, if not a full-blown depression. Crunk is dead, 
the only recent relevant rapper 
referencing Houston is Canadian 
and OutKast is already a fond 
memory. Entering the void left by 
the fall of Third Coast rap is rapper/
producer Big K.R.I.T., whose first 
(official) studio album, Live From 
the Underground, is an unabashed 

attempt to breathe life back into the 
subgenre that produced legends like 
Ludacris, UGK and 8-Ball & MJG. 

From the get-go, K.R.I.T.’s flow 
is unmistakably Southern, with a 
round drawl and slurred, dropped 
consonants. He even makes it a 
point to pepper Live with appear-
ances by the very rappers that first 
made the Dirty South famous, 
including guest verses by Ludacris, 
Bun B and 8-Ball & MJG. On “Cool 
2 Be Southern,” K.R.I.T. muses, 
“Talking ‘bout the dirty south/ folks 
with the grilles in mouth/ I make 
it cool to be Southern.” Later in the 
album, he jokes, “If you looking 
for a Southern country bumpkin, 
lemme be him.”

But K.R.I.T. is by no means a tra-
ditional Southern rapper. While he 
crafts his beats with instrumentation 
and heavy bass reminiscent of UGK, 

he rarely achieves their chaotic, 
yet effortless, soul. Though urgent, 
K.R.I.T. is often excessively wordy, 
a flaw magnified by his choice of 
complex beats that compete with his 
lyrics for attention. 

The album’s highlights are prom-
ising, though. On “Hydroplaning,” 
an anti-sobriety anthem with Devin 
the Dude, K.R.I.T. is able to adjust 
his flow to a (cough) syrupy-smooth 
beat. He drawls, “All I know is that 
my world is slow/ I like this better/ 
light as a feather/ too fly to land.” 
This is the essence of Southern rap: 
music made for driving through the 
city at a crawl. So, while Big K.R.I.T. 
is nowhere near ready to relight the 
Dirty South torch, the Third Coast 
has reason to be hopeful.

room, write me a message. The roommates 
are pretty typical San Diego State students, 
they enjoy a few spirits on the weekends 
and they don’t attend class often. They have 
no outstanding police records that I know 
of and they are not creepy in any way. They 
are pretty good guys and I have stayed with 
them for years, so if you are interested you 
should come by and meet my roommates. 
Oh yeah, the guy I share a bedroom with has 
a girlfriend that lives in downtown, so I have 
a single about half the time. Reply online to

Field coach Darcy Ahner] thought I 
was the [Cal State Chico] head coach 
calling to play a prank on them, but 
as I sent them more and more info I 
think they just didn’t believe me until 
I tried out and was actually as good as 
I said I was.”

Howe has continued to stand 
out in his subsequent four years 
on the track — a four-time CCAA 
Champion, three-time All-American, 
two-time NCAA Division II National 
Champion and school record holder.

Still, Howe is looking for more.
“Honestly, this senior year was a 

little disappointing for me because I 
did not win [the Cal/Nevada meet]
or, more depressingly and recently, 
NCAA’s for a third time,” Howe said. 
“But you either get defeated or pick 
yourself up and keep dreaming, and 
that’s what I’ll do. I just gotta keep 
working and learn from my mistakes.”

Howe will be training this 
summer at the Chula Vista Olympic 
Center alongside U.S. National 
Champion Mike Hazle. Howe will 
then spend the next school year 
training with other Track and Field 
alumni — sprinters Kelly Fogarty, 
Stephanie LaFever, Linda Rainwater 
and Christine Merrill — as part of 
a group of postgraduates. Dubbed 
the ‘Triton Track Club,’ made up of 
former collegiate standouts, the ‘club’ 
is currently sponsored by ‘Movin 
Shoes,’ a locally owned small business 
specializing in running apparel.

Howe threw his furthest mark to 
date last year — 231.5’— at the NCAA 
Division II National Championship. 
When asked about where he sees 
himself this time next year, Howe 
said he would like to be consistently 
hitting around 260.’

“I think I have the raw materials 
to hit that mark,” Howe said. “It’s a 
matter of getting the form right, the 
timing right — everything has to 
come together.”

Despite taking two back-to-back 
national titles in 2010 and 2011, 
Howe hit a roadblock last weekend, 
May 26 to 28 in this year’s national 
championships. 

In a strong field, which included 
two throwers that bested Howe’s 
current personal record, Howe ended 
up with a 223’ mark to finish in fifth 
place.

When asked about bridging the 

gap from being amongst the top in 
NCAA Division II to being amongst 
the best in the world Howe said, “It’s 
a matter of just a tiny amount of 
patience in my form. Just changing 
the angle of my hips or the way I hold 
my arm back could make that huge 
leap of 30, 40 feet that would take me 
to the next level.”

Howe is succeeded by his younger 
brother, freshman Nash Howe — a 

legitimate 6’5”— who will carry on 
the family trade. Nash placed second 
at the CCAA conference tournament 
this year, behind his brother.

“Nash is the best training partner 
I could ask for. He’s motivational 
and a beast when it comes to getting 
focused on what goal or area of 
technique we are working on,” Howe 
said. “Its a blessing to have him here 
with me and I’m so excited to keep 

going with him.”
Nash’s throw of 199’1” at the 

CCAAs qualified him for this year’s 
USA Junior Olympic Trials in 
Indiana. If he finishes in the top 
two, he will represent the U.S. at 
the upcoming 2012 Summer Junior 
Olympics in Barcelona, Spain.

12 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, MAY 31,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

BEST IN THROW
Senior Track Captain 
Nick Howe will 
graduate UCSD with a 
school record and two 
NCAA national titles, but 
he’s not done yet.

BY RACHEL UDA
Sports Editor

On a campus dominated by the athletically unimpressive,  6’3” Nick Howe (6’3.5” if you 
ask him, 6’4” according to the 
Union-Tribune article written 
about him two weeks ago) is 
easily recognizable on Library 
Walk. 

Howe’s blonde hair, playfully 
spiked up or shaved on the 
sides, takes the edge off of the 
210-pound, three-time All-
American, who trains the NCAA 
sanctioned six days a week, 
alternatively lifting weights or 
working on form in order to 
generate enough force to send a 
spear through a person. 

Or, on the track, in order 
to propel a javelin upwards to 
231.5’ away. 

The two-time national 
champion in the javelin has one 
more meet left in his collegiate 
career before he walks the stage 
as part of the graduating class 
of 2012. Howe will take part in 
the U.S. Track and Field meet 
at UCLA this weekend, June 1 
to 2 before graduating with a 
B.A. in Political Science from 
Revelle College. With a 3.3 GPA, 
Howe will also graduate with 
a spot at the University of San 
Diego School of Law, where he 
will study part-time for the next 
four years. 

“It’s really the best of 
all situations: personally, 
professionally and athletically,” 
Howe said. “I get to stay 
down here to train with my 
coach [Tony Salerno], see the 
development of my brother 
Nash and be with my girlfriend 

Jackie [Rose]. I also get to help 
coach the throwers next year 
because I will be attending USD 
part time, and I will be taking up 
personal training to supplement 
my income.”

The winningest individual 
athlete at UCSD comes with an 
origin story all his own. Howe, 
who excelled in both basketball 
and baseball in high school, 
had never tried his luck in the 
javelin until the summer before 
entering UCSD. Convinced by 
his father, a collegiate javelin 
thrower at UC Riverside whose 
221’5” mark from 1980 still 
stands as the program record, 
Howe gave it a try. In the vacant 
lot outside of his home in 
Little Elm, Texas, Howe threw 
an unheard of 180’ in his first 
attempt. 

“I didn’t think much of it, 
and as always, my Dad was 
super supportive and told me 
I could do it, and now that’s 
exactly what I do.” Howe said. 
“I just walk out there and do it, 
every day for hours.”

Faced with the decision to 
either walk onto the then-No. 
2 nationally-ranked UCSD 
baseball team with a 91 mph 
fastball in tow, or trying out 
for the Track and Field team, 
Howe contacted UCSD’s track 
and field coach Tony Salerno.

Salerno assumed Howe was 
a hoax, that one of the many 
track coaches he’s in contact 
with had drafted the email 
Howe had sent to him as a joke. 
The last person to have thrown 
comparable to 180’ their first go 
was former world record holder 
Tom Petranoff, back in 1977.
