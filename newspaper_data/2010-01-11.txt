A.S. President Utsav Gupta proposed at last 
Wednesday’s A.S. council meeting  to cut the umbilical 
cord of university funding by creating a subsection of 
the council with no ties to the university.

This  separate section would be a 501(c)(3) group 
— a nonprofit, tax-exempt organization — unaffiliated 
with UCSD. Under this plan, current council opera-
tions would continue as is, but the auxiliary section 

would be independent from 
the university and therefore not 
subject to its restrictions.

“A.S. does enjoy the benefits 
of being a university depart-
ment,” Gupta said. “But being 
a university department also 
creates certain restrictions on 
our efforts.”

The council is not required 
to pay for services such as lia-
bility protection and meeting 
space; however, it cannot offer 

services covered by other departments, such as build-
ing off-campus homes, because the housing provision 
is already covered by Housing, Dining and Hospitality. 
Gupta said this prevents possibilities like a Greek row 
at UCSD. 

 The plan is modeled after UC Berkeley’s student 
government, where the main governing body is a 
501(c)(3) organization, and a smaller governing board 
is affiliated with the university. However, Gupta plans 
to instate the opposite arrangement — with A.S. 
Council remaining a UC affiliate complemented by a 
501(c)(3) group — to preserve university funding. 

To fund this auxiliary branch, Gupta plans to 
propose a voluntary student-fee referendum similar 
to the model used by student organization CALPIRG, 
in which students are charged only after completing a 
form.

Gupta said he does not expect administrative road-
blocks in implementation of this proposal.

“This model has already been applied on campus, 
most notably in the case of the Alumni Association,” 
he said. “Any roadblocks the administration provided 
would be inconsistent with current policies.”

A special committee will be created to clarify the 
logistics — such as voluntary-fee rate — of the plan. 
Gupta hopes to finalize his proposal by Week Five so it 
can be included on the Spring Quarter election ballot.

In hopes of autonomy, council 
moves to create a nonprofit entity 
separate from the university.

< he corporate confines of Price Center played host to four packed events this weekend, including hip-hop 
dance Winter Whiteout Party on 
Friday and the annual Let’s Bounce 
rave on Saturday.

Simultaneously, Los Angeles dee-
jay Nosaj Thing played at the Loft 
on Saturday and the New Boyz — of 
“You’re a Jerk” fame — played at Price 
Center Ballroom East on Friday.  

According to Deejay Vinylphiles 
Club President Jacob Lanman, Let’s 
Bounce reached its 2,500-person limit 
barely an hour after the event began, 
forcing event handlers to turn away 
thousands of wound-be attendees 
through the night. ß

A.S. President Utsav Gupta said 

Winter Quarter events are typically less 
extravagant than those that take place 
Fall or Spring Quarters — especially 
since Winter Fest was discontinued 
two years ago. The annual student-
funded Fall Fest requires around 
$135,000 in programming funds, and 

Sun God takes up 
about $550,000 of the 
Executive Budget.

“Winter Quarter 
has historically become 
a quarter where people 
don’t want to organize 
large-scale events,” 

Gupta said. “Winter Quarter’s usually a 
lot more dead. So it’s encouraging to see 
large events like Let’s Bounce, the Jerk 
Dance, the Loft — and student organi-

After a second football forum on Jan. 
7, A.S. President Utsav Gupta is writing an 
official proposal for a football referendum — 
slated to run on the Spring Quarter A.S. elec-
tion ballot — in hopes of starting a football 
team at UCSD.

Gupta spearheaded the referendum after 
a student survey last spring showed that — of 
the 5,174 students surveyed — 72.65 percent 
said they supported the idea of a Division-II 

intercollegiate football team at UCSD. 
According to Gupta, an annual budget of 

$1 to $2 million — drawn from student fees 
— would be necessary to support the team, 
requiring $20 to $30 from each student per 
quarter.

Gupta said he is working with administra-
tors from the Student Affairs Office to create 
an itemized budget specifying the costs of a 
football team, as well as with Chancellor Marye 
Anne Fox and Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Penny Rue to develop a written pro-
posal — which he will submit to the A.S. 

Council for review by Week Five of this quar-
ter. The draft will list the setbacks of a UCSD 
football team and offer solutions to the major 
arguments against the creation of a program 
— some of which include funding and the 
logistics of expanding the current Triton Track 
and Field Stadium to a regulation football field.

The proposal will also address Title IX  — 
a law which prohibits discrimination on the 
basis of gender in any educational program.  
The law requires an equal number of men and

zations planning things for them.”
The New Boyz concert — 

opened by DJ Skyblue — reached 
its 600-person capacity early in the 
night. According to Associate Vice 
President of Concerts and Events 
Alex Bramwell, approximately 400 
people were turned away by the end 
of the evening. 

“It was a much bigger event than 
we anticipated,” he said. “By the time 
the doors opened at 8  p.m., there 
were at least [600] students in the 
line, and the line continued to grow.”

The Winter Whiteout Party sold 
500 tickets, earning roughly $3,000 
for student volunteer organization 
Alternative Breaks.

The Nosaj Thing concert sold 
out early on, quickly achieving the 
Loft’s 225-person capacity in spite 
of charging attendees for tickets — 
atypical for a venue that advertises a 
“pay as you can” policy.

Even a fire alarm — pulled by 
an unknown student at around 
10:30 p.m., according to Gupta — 
and string of emergency vehicles 
couldn’t break up the party for 

DVC and Nosaj Thing. Thousands 
of students evacuated Price Center, 
but the music continued on Let’s 
Bounce’s  outdoor stage until doors 
re-opened 20 minutes later.

According to Muir College 
freshman and Let’s Bounce attendee 
Isaac Lu, the alarm simply relocated 
the party outdoors.

“The outside sets went from five 
people dancing with themselves to 
over 400 people in a matter of five 
minutes,” Lu said.

Muir College sophomore and 
Loft concertgoer Alex Chwalik said 
the Nosaj Thing performance was 
only on hold for 10 minutes.

“The fire alarm went off during 
the second opener of the night, and 
we were all, ‘Yeah, that’s a really 
cool fire-alarm effect that you’re 
doing,’ and then everyone was like, 
‘…wait,’” Chwalik said. “[Coming 
back in] was a very, very fast pro-
cess, and then everybody went back 
to enjoying the show.”

Contributing Writer

Researchers from UCSD, 
UC Santa Barbara and the 
Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology have developed a liquid 
concoction that detects and kills 
cancerous tumors in mice.

The researchers —UCSD chem-
ists, UC Santa Barbara cell biolo-
gists and MIT 
bioengineers — 
combined three 
different types 
of tiny particles 
(one billionth 
of a meter, or 
one nanometer, 
in size) that 
can together 
locate tumors 
and inject them 
with anti-cancer 
medication.

Their find-
ings will be 
officially pub-
lished in a forth-
coming issue 
of Proceedings 
of the National 
Academy 
of Sciences. 
Michael Sailor, a 
UCSD chemistry 
and biochemis-
try professor, is 
the primary author of the findings.

The nano cocktail, which took 
nine years to develop, is imple-
mented in two procedures. In the 
first procedure, two nanoparticles 
are combined and injected into 
the body to detect the presence of 
tumors.

The gold nanorod — similar 
in shape to a hollowed-out pencil, 
and discovered by MIT graduate 

student Geoffrey von Maltzahn — 
travels through cells until it reaches 
a tumor. 

According to Sailor, iron-oxide 
nanoparticles are used to form a 
polymer sheath around the gold 
rods, creating a chain called a nano-
worm.

The iron-oxide particles, dis-
covered in 2005 by UCSD graduate 
student Ji-Ho Park, have a special 

magnetic prop-
erty that causes 
them to show up 
clearly on mag-
netic resonance 
imaging (MRI) 
systems. Without 
the iron oxide 
as a contrast 
agent, tumors in 
an earlier stage 
of cancer were 
more difficult for 
an MRI machine 
to detect. 

Additionally, 
researchers 
found that the 
gold rods were 
more effective at 
locating tumors 
when strung 
together. Sailor 
said the effect 
is like catching 
a basketball: It’s 
easier with two 

hands than one.
The second procedure is used 

to attack the tumors. This nano 
cocktail contains the same gold 
nanorods alongside drug-loaded 
liposomes. Liposomes are similar 
to water balloons; in this case, 
researchers fill them with the anti-
cancer drug doxorubicin. After the 
rods locate the tumors, the lipo-
somes can deliver the doxorubicin 

to the tumor and kill it. 
The cocktail was initially tested 

on laboratory mice.When injected 
into mice with cancerous tumors, 
their tumors disappeared. 

“A cancer patient gets three, four, 
five drugs, and each drug meets a 
different part of the disease,” Sailor 
said. “The nano cocktail has a one-
two punch to the tumor. It has been 
quite effective — but it hasn’t been 
translated to humans yet.”

The cocktail won’t be used com-
mercially until it has been tested it 
on humans, as mice aren’t suscep-
tible to all human illnesses.

“The next step is to try to spin 
this out to a company,” Sailor said. 
“The chemicals work in mice, but 
a lot of what works in a mouse will 
fail on humans.” 

Sailor said that if the product is 
picked up by a company, then the 
company will instigate a clinical 
trial on humans.

However, there are no plans at 
this time for further investigation 
into the use of nanoparticles on 
humans. 

After his study was featured in 
Popular Science — a monthly mag-
azine that reports on new technolo-
gy — Sailor received various letters 
from cancer patients asking if they 
could volunteer themselves or their 
loved ones to help with clinical tri-
als involving the nanoworms.

Sailor said that the letters, which 
line the hall outside his UCSD 
office, remind him and his students 
of the importance of their research. 

“At the end of the day, you ask 
yourself what you have done,” Sailor 
said. “These cards and letters are 
poignant and help set your focus. It 
makes what you do worthwhile.”

I’ve never been one for prompt-ness (that pasty-white out-of-breath guy who shows up to 
lecture 10 minutes later, Perks cup 
at hand? That’s me). So — to shrink 
the window of my late arrival — I’ve 
mastered the art of Library Walk 
promoter avoidance in my time here 
at UCSD. Eye-aversion, curt head-
shake, tight-lipped thanks-but-no-
thanks grin; these are all hallmarks of 
my daily mad-dash to Center Hall. 

But last week was a little different.

I set out on my normal path 
with the same objective as always: to 
shove my way to class as ruthlessly 
as ever. By the time I made it safely 
past the bookstore — still unsolicited 
by InterVarsity groupies and sorority 
girls alike — it occurred to me that I 
wasn’t the only one pulling the eye-
aversion maneuver on Library Walk. 
They were. 

Maybe it’s the fact that I’m no 
longer a slow-paced, doe-eyed fresh-
man. Maybe sporting skinny jeans 
and a pink polo distinguished me as 
an unlikely TKE pledge. In any event, 
the Koreans and the Greeks had 
spoken, and their message was clear: 
You, cardigan-wearer, are unworthy 
of my flyer. Try Greenpeace.

While I’ve never been too keen 
on renewing my relationship with 
Jesus Christ, the fact that their offers 
were once on the table was a source 
of amused annoyance — maybe even 
subconscious flattery. It’s sort of like 
the feeling I’ll get during “Gilmore 
Girls” commercial breaks. Perhaps 
I’m not Playtex’s real target demo-
graphic, but the cloying offers inevi-
tably remain. 

The difference now, though, 
is that those former objects of my 
annoyance have been muted. It 
might seem a relief to have finally 
rid myself of their attention, but the 
sting of rejection never hurts so deep 
as when it’s from someone you didn’t 
want in the first place. (Sorry, Chess 
Club — but I guess it’s really not you, 
it’s me).

It’s funny: looks like one spoonful 
of Korean Club rejection is enough 
to make me long for the more both-
ersome days of yore. 

As fate would have it, the next 
day, the reverse turned out to be true 
with — surprise, surprise — gay-
marriage cheerleaders. Evidently, the 
American Civil Liberties Union, for 
one, doesn’t discriminate against the 
cardigan-outfitted men among us. 
Or was it the carelessly unbuttoned 
polo?

Whatever the case, I suppose my 
student-org discriminators can pat 
themselves on the back for success-
fully judging this book by its cover. 

But even if they’re spot-on in 
their judgment, and the bookstore’s 
trash bins are one InterVarsity flyer 
lighter for it, a part of me — a small, 
shamelessly attention-starved part — 
sort of wishes they’d still hoist their 
little promotional scraps at me any-
way. Because as much as it may suck 
to be halted six times on the sprint 
to Pepper Canyon Hall, there’s no 
downer quite like being greeted by a

HIGHER EDUCATION — Another unusual 
market has emerged on Craigslist (only this 
one doesn’t involve Nixon-era furniture or 
locks of Angelina Jolie’s hair). 

Credit vouchers for university classes, or 
certificates that can be applied for discounted 
tuition, are being seedily auctioned off to the 
highest bidder. While these underhanded 
online exchanges might seem harmless, they 
should remind universities of the shadiness 
of distributing flashy certificates in the first 
place.

Although the University of California 
does not currently offer them, a number of 
private Midwestern and East-Coast schools 

— Harvard included — offer certificates rang-
ing from several hundred to a few thousand 
dollars. Some vouchers, though, leave a blank 
space for the recipient’s name — so once these 
gift cards leave colleges’ hands, they have no 
say in what happens to them, thereby paving 
the way for online exploitation. At schools like 
St. John’s University, St. Joseph’s University and 
Mount St. Mary College in New York, this is 
often the case.

The auctions do have some sweet deals: 
a 1.5-credit course at St. John’s is currently 
listed for $950 and a three-credit course at St. 
Joseph’s for $1000 on Craigslist. Depending on 
the program, that’s about $800 off the regular 

price. A Craigslist advertisement for a three-
credit voucher at the New York Institute of 
Technology reads, “Can be used as undergrad-
uate OR graduate credits!!! Must sell fast!!!” 
With that kind of deal on the line, it’s no won-
der voucher-hunting is on the rise.

Vouchers are sometimes gifted as a ‘Thank 
you’ to schoolteachers who allow university 
students majoring in education to sit in on 
their lessons, or as “store credit” when stu-
dents drop classes.

Otterbein College also doles out the vouch-
ers to high-school seniors it hopes to enroll.

Using unauthorized images of public figures for promotional purposes might be grow-
ing in popularity, but that doesn’t make it any less 
troublesome. 

Although Michelle Obama happens to support 
PETA’s cause, her disapproval of fur in this case 
hardly justifies the use of her approving face-stamp 
without permission. On top of that, PETA is only 
distracting from its message with shady practices.

Last May, American Apparel agreed to pay 
director Woody Allen $5 million after he sued the 
company for using his image in two promotional 
billboards. Allen argued that by using his image 
without his permission, the fashion retail chain 
was obstructing New York’s right-to-privacy law 
— and sure enough, it paid off. 

Just because Obama won’t have time to deal 
with this ridiculousness, PETA’s sneaky branding 
isn’t any less arrogant — and only more unfair.

To understand why the White House is upset about Michelle Obama’s unauthorized 
photo release in the latest PETA campaign is 
easy — no one shouldn’t take anyone’s mug shot 
and plaster it on a product without consent.

But as it turns out, Mrs. Obama herself 
released a statement last year declaring her 
wardrobe fur-free. So despite PETA’s stupidity 
in surpassing basic endorsement protocol in its 
promotional photo, the commotion surround-
ing the breach of privacy rights is completely 
overblown. 

There’s been no twisting of Obama’s stance 
on the use of fur — so even if PETA didn’t get 
Obama’s official OK, there’s no reason for such 
an uproar. If anything, Michelle is furthering a 
cause without lifting a finger.

—Kelsey Marrujo
Senior Staff Writer

On Dec. 28, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals released an ad campaign fea-
turing Carrie Underwood, Tyra Banks, Oprah 
Winfrey and Michelle Obama as “Fur-Free and 
Fabulous” — without Obama’s consent.

Even though PETA’s ethical practices may have 
been questionable, it was a brilliant move from an 
economic standpoint.

According to prominent branding consul-
tant Derrick Daye, using the First Family in ad 
campaigns presents little risk and a huge upside. 
Companies aren’t afraid to use unauthorized pho-
tos of the Obamas, as the White House doesn’t 
exactly have time to sue over such trivialities.

President Obama, too, was recently featured in 
a Weatherproof Garment-brand jacket on a bill-
board in Times Square. While the company had to 
take it down, its sales have gone through the roof. 

More and more ad campaigns are hopping on 
the Obama bandwagon — and with evidently so 
little at stake for the companies in question, it’s a 
trend that won’t be disappearing anytime soon.

Dear Editor,
I would like to express our solidar-

ity with students protesting the 32-per-
cent tuition hikes at California’s public 
universities. As activists who believe 
in a young person’s ability to fight for 
change, this is precisely the kind of 
civic engagement we strive to achieve.

In a time of economic crisis, young 
people are especially hurt. We are 
the least-insured and least-employed 
age demographic in our country. We 
understand that hard times demand 
fiscal prudence and sacrifice. However, 
adding such a sudden and steep 
increase in tuition to the already heavy 
economic burden facing our genera-
tion is unjust and excessive.

University administrators and the 
state of California must address the 
students’ concerns as equal partners. 
These and future decisions about the 
education system must be made in 
consultation with all stakeholders, 
especially the students.

Furthermore, we ask our federal 
government to consider the plight 
of states facing such tough choices 
regarding the education of our gen-
eration. As we make policy choices 
on a national level regarding both war 
and peace and stimulus and deficit, 
we encourage lawmakers to heed the 
plight of students in California across 
the nation and help them.

Our generation is facing the great-
est economic crisis in over 50 years. 
To build a successful 21st-century 
American economy, our leaders must 
encourage education, not discourage it 
by piling on student debt with massive 
tuition increases. We support students’ 
efforts to make education affordable 
and within reach for all Americans.

But of the 40 students who received 
Otterbein vouchers last spring, 
only one has actually redeemed 
it — which is probably because 
Otterbein’s non-transferable vouch-
ers are Craigslist-proof. 

At the very least, tuition vouchers 
should avoid the black-market game. 
Clearly, no admissions office wants 
to see its good name whispered in 
the seedier depths of online auction 
sites.

But the mere existence of uni-
versity vouchers presents a problem. 
Sure, in a tougher economic climate, 
expensive private universities have to 
create more attractive eye-catchers 
for prospective students — but 
handing out gift certificates that 

might deceive prospective students 
into choosing a school that doesn’t 
best fit their needs or one they can’t 
ultimately afford isn’t the answer. 

There are countless other ways 
for universities to offer financial 
assistance to both those in need and 
those it hopes to attract. Need-based 
financial aid and merit scholarships 
serve the same general purpose as 
vouchers — and avoid the degrading 
car-salesman aesthetic of an official 
school-sanctioned goody bag. 

Awarding a tuition voucher to a 
prospective student without clari-
fying the myriad hidden costs of 
attendance convolutes an already 
complicated financial aid process. 

It’s certainly a good business plan 
to tempt students with free credit; 

it’s the same idea as getting store 
credit from a returned Christmas 
gift at Macy’s. In offering vouch-
ers, participating universities aim 
to make return shoppers of these 
recipients. 

But the business tactics of depart-
ment stores don’t behoove higher 
education. The aim of financial aid 
is not to deceive as many student 
shoppers into plunking down as 
possible; it’s to increase accessibility. 
Credit vouchers — whether obtained 
rightfully or through a caps-locked 
Craigslist ad — don’t increase this 
access, just create the illusion of it.

Dear Editor,

I want to let you and your readers 
know about an opportunity to learn 
more and ask questions about the dire 
situation surrounding the Gaza Strip 
this Wednesday, Jan. 13 from 6 p.m. 
to 8 p.m., when Students for Justice in 
Palestine will be hosting a teach-in at 
the UCSD Cross-Cultural Center’s Art 
Space Room for anyone interested.

From Dec. 27, 2008 to Jan. 18, 
2009, Israel carried out a 22-day mili-
tary assault on the Gaza Strip which 
killed over 1,400 people, injured over 
5,000 and left approximately 50,000 
people homeless. Only 26 miles long 
and 6 miles wide, Gaza is one of the 
most densely populated places in the 
world. Although Israeli tanks have 
rolled out of Gaza, the devastation and 
illegal blockade continues to this day.  

Keynote speaker will be Reem 
Salahi, a member of the National 
Lawyers Guild (NLG) — among the 
first delegations to enter Gaza less than 
a month after the Israeli bombings last 
year. Reem will report back using per-
sonal pictures, research and live case 
studies from the NLG’s fact-finding 
mission. Audience members will gain 
insight of daily life in the open-air 
prison better known as the Gaza Strip.

ROGER’S PLACE

Last Wednesday, in light of recent drastic budget cuts to the public higher-edu-cation system in California, Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger promised to “protect” funding for educa-
tion in his State of the State speech.

“[California’s] priorities have become out of whack 
over the years,” Schwarzenegger said. 

In the situation of Eleanor Roosevelt College senior 
Lara Dildy — a student whose parents don’t meet 
financial-aid requirements — the protection, if delivered, 
couldn’t come a moment too soon.

“The UC system was created so that it wasn’t about 
whether or not you had the financial means to go this 
school,” Dildy said. “It was about whether you demon-
strated the academic skills and the perseverance.”

For Dildy, the fee increases approved by the Board 
of Regents in November reflect a shifting of higher-up 
priorities.

In 1960, the Master Plan for Higher Education in 
California was enacted, setting up a postsecondary public 
schooling system in which higher education was envi-
sioned as a public good. Under the Master Plan — which 
applied to the University of California, California State 
University and California Community College systems — 
affordability and access were key. 

Tuition was originally intended to be free, with only 
auxiliary costs like recreation and housing made manda-
tory for students, while the state was responsible for fund-
ing instruction. 

But as the state budget has shrunk steadily over the 
last five decades, student fees have increased to cover 
academic costs. According to the 2009-2010 Budget for 
Current Operations Budget Detail, since the 1990-91 
academic year, the state’s share of per-student funding has 
dropped 40 percent — and this number will likely grow, 
as the budget detail was released before more significant 
cuts were made in 2009.

RED TAPE
For Dildy, this January’s 15-percent tuition hike has 

made 
affordability — 

upon which the Master Plan was 
founded — a sweet but unrealistic ideal. 

Dildy first ran into financial difficulties in December 
2008, when her dad lost his job. She later approached the 
financial-aid office for assistance but left empty-handed, 
as her financial-aid eligibility was determined by her 
parents’ tax return from the year before. Dildy resorted to 
applying for a private loan, which took months to secure.

“There’s a lot of people out there who do need finan-
cial aid and aren’t getting it because their parents make 
too much,” Dildy said. “It’s like, that’s great, I’m glad my 
parents are making money — but that doesn’t mean 
they’re giving that money to me.” 

According to Dildy, a large portion of her parents’ 
income goes toward medical care, as members of her 
family — including herself — suffer from health issues. 

“[The money’s] not just sitting there in the bank or 
buying gold bars,” Dildy said. “It’s being used. It’s sup-
porting a very pinched lifestyle already. People say, ‘Your 
parents have money.’ But where is it? Because no one is 
sending me a check every month.”

Dildy planned to use the private loan she received to 
finance her final year at UCSD. As a result of the midyear 
fee hike, however, she has calculated that her loan will 
only last until March.

“They did the fee increases, which pretty much makes 
it so that, at this point — even if my step-mom also hadn’t 
recently lost her job over Thanksgiving — I still wouldn’t 
have had enough money to get me through the year,” 
Dildy said. “Now I’m at a point where I have to reapply 
for another loan.”

However badly she needs the money, Dildy says she is 
completely disenchanted with UCSD’s aid system.

“The lady that helped me [at the financia-aid office] 
was really, really great,” Dildy said. “She was a really sweet 
lady, but it was kind of like, all that bureaucratic red tape 
was just getting in the way of people who generally just 
need help. It’s a fucked up system. People who already had 
financial aid — friends that I have — ran into difficulty 

getting money to cover the new fee increase.”
In UC President Mark G. Yudof ’s Oct. 16, letter 

announcing the proposed increases, he promised that 
one-third of the revenue from the tuition hikes would be 
allocated for financial aid. Yudof wrote that additional aid 
would cover the new fees for close to 75 percent of under-
graduates whose household incomes fell below $180,000. 
Some students have reported receiving additional aid 
prior to the January increase, but as the $585 hike just 
became effective, no figures have been released to deter-
mine whether or not all three-quarters of the qualified 
students received extra funding as promised.

Now, Dildy — a double major in communications and 
political science — faces an uncertain final two quarters 
before graduation. 

“I don’t know if I have enough money to graduate this 
spring,” Dildy said. ”And it’s been getting like, really dif-
ficult because combining the anxiety of trying to worry 
every single month — like, ‘Wait, OK, how am I going to 
pay for the rent? How am I going to do this? Am I going 
to be able to pay for this quarter?’ And then combining 
that with, ‘How am I going to try and stay on top of 16 
units every quarter?’ You know, it just creates these huge 
anxiety levels. And I’m probably 10 times more exhausted 
than I remember being before my dad lost his job.”

Luckily, Dildy said her professors have been under-
standing of her situation.

“Teachers, I think, need to be more aware of the 
potential for things like this to happen to students. And 
I understand there’s strict standards for academics, but 
[financial issues] put a huge damper on people’s emo-
tional well-being,” said Dildy. “It’s hard to separate your 
school when you see everything around you sort of 
crashing.”

TAIKO

O ne of the noisiest clubs on cam-pus — setting off car alarms in the lowest levels of Pangea 
every Friday night — Taiko has been 
drumming up fanfare across San 
Diego since its beginnings in 2002. 

“It’s not really a competition or 
anything — it’s just getting together, 
hanging out, playing drums, being 
really loud and getting food after,” 
Taiko Director of External Affairs 
Mark Takesuye said.

The club is made up of around 
25 members — almost all of whom 
play multiple instruments: includ-
ing the barrel-sized chu-daiko 
drum, the snare-like shime-daiko 
(a double-sided snare drum) and a 
variety of other metal percussion 
instruments. 

According to Takesuye, all the 
club’s drums have been passed 
down from past generations.

“The original people were play-
ing on phone books for a couple 
— I want to say a year and a half,” 
Takesuye said. “They played with 
just phone books and chairs while 
they were making their drums.”

On top of the inherited rel-
ics, the team makes new drums 

by stretching cowhide across wine 
barrels they’ve taken apart and 
truncated.

Though Taiko drumming first 
began as a village alarm system 
in ancient Japan, it morphed into 
more of a performance once it 
caught on in the states. 

Every year the club hosts 
month-long tryouts at the begin-
ning of Fall Quarter for anyone 
interested in practicing with exist-
ing members and learning the 
basics; auditions are held soon 
after. This year, Taiko accepted 
eight new members.

Although the club runs a tight 
shift — practicing two or three 
times a week or more if there’s 
an upcoming performance — 
Takesuye decribes it as a laid-back, 
almost athletic musical experience 
that makes sure to enjoy itself all 
the while. 

“It’s a really friendly community 
— a big community when we all 
meet up together,” Takesuye said. 
“We all just hang out and have a 
good time.”

FOCUS� MONDAY, JANUARY 11, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 9 

California State University, and 
admission was open at California 
Community Colleges. 

According to the UC Office 
of the President summary of 
the Plan, these guidelines were 
established to guarantee access to 
higher education. But for former 
Revelle College first year Enrique 
Aguilar, a guaranteed spot isn’t 
enough.

Although Aguilar has been a 
California resident for nine years 
and graduated from a California 
public high school, as a Mexican 
citizen, he was considered an 
international student. As a result, 
Aguilar didn’t qualify for publicly 
funded financial aid. Unable to 
pay the fee hikes himself, Aguilar 
was forced to drop out of UCSD.

Aguilar moved to San Jose 
with his parents and younger 
brother when he was nine years 
old with his sights set on attend-
ing a UC campus.

“Ever since I came to this 
country, I had heard of the 
University of California system,” 
Aguilar said. “I knew it was a 
prestigious university, and I 
always wanted to go to a UC ever 
since I got here.”

Aguilar applied to eight UC 
campuses and received offers of 
admission from six of them, but 
ultimately settled on UCSD and 
started as a computer-engineering 
major in Fall Quarter 2009. 
Because Aguilar attended a 
California high school for more 
than three years and graduated, 
he qualified for in-state tuition 
under California Assembly Bill 
540.  He received a private schol-
arship, but as a result of family 
circumstances and rising educa-
tional costs, it wasn’t enough.

“I couldn’t finish the quarter 
because the longer I stayed, the 
more money I would have had 

to pay for housing,” Aguilar said. 
“My dad doesn’t work as much, 
so he doesn’t earn as much as 
before. The fee increase just made 
it worse. It made it impossible for 
me to be paying for everything 
out of my own pocket.”

Aguilar said he wasn’t able to 
secure a private loan, because he 
couldn’t find a U.S. citizen with 
good credit who was willing to co-
sign — a requirement to receive 
the loan. After making rounds to 
the housing office, academic advis-
ing and the financial-aid office to 
no avail, Aguilar left San Diego on 
Nov. 22, 2009, a few weeks before 
the end of his first quarter.

Currently, Aguilar is enrolled 
in general-education classes at 
Evergreen Valley College.

“I will be attending com-
munity college, and that’s 
obviously not going to be the 
same,” Aguilar said. “I really got 
attached to UCSD. I felt really 
safe there because UCSD has the 
largest [Lesbian Gay Bisexual 
Transgender] Resource Center at 
any public university, and I actu-
ally lived in LGBT housing. Now 
I’m going to have to [transfer] to 
a private school, because they are 
the only ones that can give me 
financial aid.”

Aguilar is also considering 
schools abroad. If he takes this 
path, Aguilar said he would 
attend a more affordable private 
university in Mexico, then trans-
fer to a university in Canada or 
Britain after two years.

But if the still pend-
ing Development, Relief and 
Education for Alien Minors 
Act — which was introduced 
in its current form to Congress 
last March, but has been kicked 
around legislative chambers since 
2001 — had been passed, Aguilar 
might have had it easier. Under 
the D.R.E.A.M. Act, qualified 

noncitizen students would be 
eligible to apply for student loans 
and the federal work-study pro-
gram. The act would also grant 
these students temporary residen-
cy — the first step to obtaining 
U.S. citizenship.

“I just hope that Obama pass-
es the D.R.E.A.M. Act,” Aguilar 
said. “A lot of students in the 
same situation as me are depend-
ing on it. It doesn’t seem to be 
a priority right now, but a lot of 
students are still being optimistic. 
I still have some hope.” 

As Dildy and Aguilar would 
attest, the priorities of the 1960 
Master Plan — access and 
affordability — are, as Gov. 
Schwarzenegger put it, out of 
whack. Under the plan, higher 
education was envisioned as a 
public good. But according to a 
Dec. 8, 2009 Sacramento Bee arti-
cle, in a series of legislative hear-
ings held to review the Master 
Plan, Yudof admitted that the 
university seems to have strayed 
from its founding principles.

“We don’t want to partially 
privatize [UC] by raising fees,” 
Yudof said. “And yet that is the 
direction we seem to be heading.”

For Dildy, this direction 
betrays the very purpose of the

“This is a UC school,” Dildy 
said. “This a state school. This 
isn’t Stanford. This is not Yale. 
This isn’t Harvard. We shouldn’t 
have to pay that much. It was 
designed to be top-notch educa-
tion affordable for all people, 
particularly California residents 
— and it’s not meeting any of 
those standards. They really need 
to rethink why the UCs were cre-
ated, and they need to go back to 
that original goal.”

Y ou might not be able to tell from the soft-rock soundtrack in the background or the red-lettered 
Zodiac placemats under your dinner 
plate, but Mandarin Dynasty has seen 
its fair share of celebrity clients in a 
nearly 20-year existence. Don’t believe 
me? Check out the autographed Sarah 
Michelle Gellar magazine cover framed 
and mounted just left of the cash regis-
ter. And while you’re there, score prime 
Hillcrest cuisine for less-than-Gaslamp 
prices.

There are a ton of Chinese options in 
San Diego, ranging from to-go cafeterias 
to formal, ethnic experiences where 
menus need an English cheat sheet. But 
Dynasty has a leg up on its competition, 
because it’s got more options than most 
other places in the $10 price range, and 
maintains a humbled mom-and-pop 
class. 

Some of the restaurant’s most popu-
lar kitchen orders are the vegetarian 
entrees — specifically, sweet and sour 
“pork” or orange “chicken” replaced by 
superball-sized scoops of mock-meat 
tofu. Dynasty’s a blue-ribbon choice for 
any veggie addict sick of salads, soups 
and spring rolls. 

Aside from loads of tofu, Dynasty 
serves an assortment of family-sized 
meals serving up to eight, noodles 
(pan-fried or swimming in soup) and 
moo shu servings (chicken/pork/beef/
shrimp versions of sesame stir fry, 
wrapped in tortilla-thin “pancakes”) — 
in addition to more traditional dishes 
from the Cantonese and Szechuan 
cookbooks.

The Kung Pao Chicken comes in 
three levels of spicy and two other types 
of meat. Like most of the dinner meals, 
it arrives after a bowl of soup with a 
clump of rice and side order of your 
choosing (egg rolls or wontons). But the 
chicken steals the spotlight in a bed of 
water chestnuts, cashews (albeit slightly 
spare) and a chili-pepper sauce that’s 
best ordered especially spicy.

In a large, 
open, octago-
nal dining 
area that feels 
like an over-
sized gazebo, 

Dynasty’s vast collection of 20-year-old 
love ballads accompanies every meal — 
meaning you’ll probably be sipping egg-
drop soup to the tune of “Lady in Red.” 
Throw in some faded barn paintings, a 
few fake flowers and some floral-print 
upholstery, and you’ve got the late-
’80s living-room aesthetic that makes 
Dynasty such a charming joint.

All meals come with complimentary 
jasmine tea and a fried-noodle appetizer 
to dip in spicy mustard or sweet-and-
sour sauce. And, of course, every meal 
has a happy ending. The check comes 
with almond and fortune cookies to 
calm your newfound Mandarin Dynasty 
separation anxiety.

Parking can sometimes be a hassle 
with the new Gossip Grill next door, but 
that’s no reason to miss out on Sarah 
Michelle’s “favorite Chinese restaurant.”

full-time, interdisciplinary course of study designed to train students seeking
a career in U.S. Foreign Service, the United Nations (U.N.), U.N.–specialized
agencies, or international non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Our program

built a small advantage late in the meet, after 
Cunningham finished second and sophomore 
Neda Nguyen finished third in the 200-yard 
breaststroke. The small margin was all the Tritons 
needed:  The quartet of Shimura, freshman 
Amber Tan, sophomore Shea Kopp and junior 
Jessica Ferguson sealed the victory with  a second-
place finish in the 400 freestyle relay.

In light of the extensive workload placed upon 
them this weekend, Cunningham said her team  
handled the pressure well.

“We usually have doubles every day, so we’re 
used to having to work hard and get back in 
the water and perform at a high level again,” 
Cunningham said.

Head coach Scott McGihon said he isn’t 
worried about the team’s ability to recover in 
time for nationals. 

“We don’t change our training if we have 
a dual-meet situation,” McGihon said. “You 

just train through it, and training is all about 
learning to maximize with minimal recovery 
time.”

After the tough match at LMU, the Tritons 
returned home to take on Grand Canyon 
University and the University of the Incarnate 
Word.  Both the men’s and women’s teams landed 
easy victories.  Senior Dan Perdew scored his best 
times this season in the 50 free and 100 fly events, 
while sophomore Alex Henley made Nationals 
with an automatic-qualifying time of 2:05.77 in 
the 200 fly — headlining the women’s victory. 
Senior diver Danielle Niculescu registered the 
only victory for the diving teams in the one-
meter.

The Triton women return to the water next 
Saturday, Jan. 16 against the University of San 
Diego at Canyonview Pool.

defensive end, and we got the job done,” Lawley 
said. “Our offense hasn’t really been key [this 
season], but we got a glimpse of hope, and 
things started falling into place.”

The offensive improvement against Stanislaus 
came on the heels of a bitter defeat to Chico 
State at RIMAC Arena on Jan. 7. The Tritons 
trailed by eight points in the second half, before 
going on a 17-2 tear over the next five minutes 
to take a 45-38 lead with 15 minutes left. A layup 
by junior guard Casey Ryan gave the Tritons 
their biggest lead of the game at 52-44 — but the 
Tritons were unable to keep their lead.

Chico answered back by outscoring the 
Tritons 10-2 in the next three minutes to tie the 
game 54-54, and never relinquished momentum 
on the road to a 77-68 victory. 

Lawley, who made 22 points to lead the 
Tritons in scoring, lamented the team’s lack of 
mental preparation.

“We didn’t come out ready to play, and I 
thought we took it for granted,” Lawley said. 
“We came out a little flat-footed, and it showed.”

According to Lawley, the Tritons’ early 
struggles this season can be attributed to the 

lack of cohesion between the team’s veterans and 
a handful of new players. 

 “It’s been tough to get everyone on the same 
page,” Lawley said. “We lost a lot of chemistry, 
and nobody really knows how to play with each 
other yet — especially since we played with all of 
those graduating seniors for three or four years. 
It’s been tough to pick up off a team that was so 
cohesive last year.”

Acevedo agreed. “We had to hit the ground 
running with all of the young guys coming 
in,” he said. “I think it’s been a pretty quick 
adjustment. As far as roles go, [the younger 
players] are definitely getting a feel for what 
they need to do. [Lawley] and I have also 
learned what we have to do as leaders, and 
everyone is getting very comfortable in their 
roles. 

UCSD will follow up its winning performance 
against Cal State Stanislaus when it hosts Cal 
State Monterey Bay on Jan. 14. The game is 
scheduled to tip off at 7:30 p.m. in RIMAC 
Arena.

SWIMMING & DIVING — The Triton 
women took a narrow victory over 
conference rival Loyola Marymount 
University on Jan. 9, but were then 
dominated by Division-I powerhouse 
University of Kansas while still on the 
LMU campus. 

Despite a 150-53 loss to Kansas, 
UCSD solidified itself as a conference 
powerhouse overall, edging out LMU in 
the final heat of the competition.

“You just have to take it one meet at a 
time,” senior captain Cari Cunningham 
said. “This was against our biggest 
conference rival, so we were really 
focused.”

The University of Kansas took the 
meet by storm, placing first in nine of 
11 events. The real competition was 
between the Lions and Tritons — a race 
for points that oscillated all day.

Historically, LMU has pushed the 
Tritons to their limit in the pool. After 
falling to the Lions by a slim margin 
two years ago, the Tritons have since 
maintained an advantage with four 
straight victories in the rivalry.

Though no Triton took first in any 
race, the team showed its racing breadth 
by finishing near the top in all 11 races.

Neither the Tritons nor the Lions 
could gain a substantial lead throughout 
the competition. However, UCSD

BACK-TO-BACK WINS LAUNCH WOMEN INTO TOP 10
By Liam Rose
Staff Writer

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — UCSD 
hit RIMAC Arena last Saturday, deter-
mined to defend its historic win streak 
— and left nothing to chance against Cal 
State Stanislaus.

The Tritons notched an emphatic 72-
38 victory over the Warriors, extending 
their season-long streak to 12 games. 
Ten different UCSD players made the 
score sheet for what soon became a very 
one-sided affair.

The team was buoyed by senior guard 
Annette Ilg, who scored a game-high 
11 points. Sophomore guard Chelsea 
Carlisle, the conference’s leading scorer, 
didn’t reach double-digit scoring for the 
first time all season. However, she did 
contribute six assists and four steals to 
the winning effort.

The Tritons took the lead with 11:32 
left in the first half, and had taken a 
nine-point advantage by halftime. CSU 
Stanislaus played aggressive defense, 
making 10 of its first-half points off 
UCSD turnovers; however, the team also 
conceded 17 Triton free-throw attempts 
off excessive fouling.

“We knew Stanislaus would come 
out with lots of energy and fire, and they 
did,” head coach Charity Elliot said. “I 
really thought in the first half that we 
were out-hustled.”

Any doubts of the game’s outcome 
were put to rest shortly after halftime: 
The Tritons came out with a 10-minute 
run of 26-2, punctuated by three 
consecutive Triton three-pointers  — two 
from sophomore guard Daisy Feder and 

one from freshman forward Erin Grady. 
Elliot said that rather than make any 

tactical changes at halftime, she pep-
talked the team on focus and intensity.

“We didn’t change [any] `Xs and 
`Os at halftime,” Elliot said. “We really 
focused on picking up our defensive 
pressure; I thought that changed our 
mind-set and led to the second-half 
surge that we went on.”

Junior forward Tiffany Hunter added 
eight points onto the Triton score and 
grabbed a game-high 12 rebounds. The 
UCSD benchers nearly outscored the 
Warriors by themselves, racking up 32 
points. Feder led the bench scorers with 
nine points — all from behind the arc.

The win against Stanislaus came on 
the tail of a strong performance against 
Chico State on Jan. 7, where the Tritons 
won 75-62. UCSD took a 22-point lead 
into halftime, and from there, never 
dropped within 13 points of the Wildcats. 
Carlisle scored 23 points, and Hunter 
tallied a double-double — 13 points and 
13 rebounds — to lead the team.

The latest wins moved UCSD to 12-0 
overall and 7-0 in the conference. The 
Tritons were ranked ninth nationally in 
Division-II by USA Today and the ESPN 
coach’s poll prior to the wins, and will no 
doubt move up in the rankings after last 
weekend’s performances.

Stanislaus fell to 2-8 overall and 1-5 
in the CCAA.

The Tritons will host Cal State 
Monterey Bay at RIMAC Arena 
Thursday night at 5:30 p.m.

MEN’S BASKETBALL — The 
UCSD men snapped a three-
game losing streak on Jan. 9 when 
they defeated Cal State Stanislaus 
81-72 at RIMAC Arena. The win 
pulled the Tritons out of a slump 
that ended with a 77-68 loss to 
Chico State on Jan. 7. UCSD now 
stands at 3-7 overall and 2-4 in 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association.

The Tritons started strong 
against the Stanislaus Warriors, 
shooting 54 percent from the field 
in the first half, sinking 15 of 28 
shots and carrying a 14-point lead 
into the second half.

Though Stanislaus mounted a 
comeback that cut the Triton lead 
to a single point several times, 
they never quite pulled ahead.

Senior guard Jordan Lawley led 
Triton scoring with 26 points. He 
also grabbed 10 rebounds and five 
assists for his first double-double 
of the season.

Bench players also turned in 
strong performances: Sophomore 
guard Jay Wey registered a career-
high 13 points, hitting three of five 
attempts from three-point range.

“I thought we played real well 
and had great bench production,” 
senior guard Tyler Acevedo said. 
“We got some big shots from Jay 
Wey, who provided a big spark off 
the bench.” 

A high-scoring affair, the game 
saw the Tritons reach a season 
best of 81 points — shooting an 
impressive 56 percent from the 
field and 88 percent from the free-

throw line.
In addition to offensive 

excellence, Lawley said the 
persevering Triton defense was the 
main reason for the team’s victory.

“There were times when 
[Stanislaus] came back into the 
game, but we stuck it out on the

women’s sports teams at a public educa-
tional institution. It would either force 
the university to cut a few men’s teams or 
install additional women’s sports teams — 
such as lacrosse, field hockey or golf — to 
balance the numbers.

According to the survey taken last 
Spring Quarter, although 72.65 percent 
of students said they would support the 
team, 35.59 percent said they were not 
willing to pay fees for a football program. 

Warren College senior Stacey 
Hunsucker said she would not pay to 
support a football team.

“Although I think having a football 
team may initially be good for school 
spirit, I don’t think it would be a good 
investment in the long run, because stu-
dents may lose interest if the team isn’t 
good,” Hunsucker said.

However, Gupta is convinced that 
the benefits of having a football team 
would outweigh the costs.

“Football can be a great way to 
enhance a campus’ public image,” Gupta 
said. “It is especially important as we 
compete in the harsher economic cli-
mate with other campuses that have 
wider national recognition due to the 
quality of their athletic program.”  

Like all referendums, if the A.S. 
Council authorizes the proposal, it will 
then be passed on for approval by the 
administration as well as the UC Office of 
the President. If all parties accept the pro-
posal, the referendum will be placed on 
the Spring Quarter A.S. election ballot.
