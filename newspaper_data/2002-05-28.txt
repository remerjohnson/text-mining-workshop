University nullifies Koala hearing University, 
nurses reach 
an agreement 
UC nurses will 
not go on strike 

Administration cites violation of right to privacy 
By EVAN McLAUGHLIN 
Associate News Editor 

T he UCSD administration 
null ified a May 22 judicial board 
hearing against The Koala, citing 
the board's decision to admit 
media to the proceedings as a vio-
lation of the UCSD student con-
duct code. 

According to an e-mail sent to 
The Koala and signed by Director 
of Student Policy and J udicial 
Affairs Nicholas S. Aguilar, the 
admi nistration null ified the pro-
ceedings because the university 
contends that the public should 
not be permitted to attend judicial 
board hearings without the per-
mission of all parties involved, as 
stated in sections 22.17 .16. I6a-b 

of the student conduct code. 
KOIlill Editor in Chief George 

Liddle said he was worried about 
the university's power to nulli fy 
the hearing. 

"Obviously, we're pretty con-
cerned," Liddle said. "I was not 
aware that the university had the 
authority to declare the proceed-
ings void at the drop of a hat. It 
makes us wonder why we should 
go through this again." 

Lidd le contends that the 
unviersity's decision to bypass the 
judicial board's authority margin-
alizes the legiunacy of the pro-
ceedings. 

"It seems to me that if [the 
administration) doesn't like what 
the presiding officer decides, they 
can just make the proceedings nul l

Price Center to undergo 
changes in posting policy 
Reforms address students' concerns 
By LAURA McGANN 
Staff lMiter 

University Centers has pro-
posed changes to posting policies 
and the -blue fonning" process, 
which student organizations must 
undergo to use the Price Center 
ballrooms, meater, plaza and 

Porter's Pub. The changes wiU go 
into effect in fall quaner if 
approved. 

The proposed policy for posting 
in the Price Center would create I 
6rst-come, fint-served procedure 
in which me- wisbins to post bu-

and void." 
Phone calls made to Aguilar 'S 

office were not returned by press 
time. 

UCSD representative Cara A. 
Silbaugh left Wednesday's pro-
ceedings after the administration's 
motion was denied, saying that she 
had been instructed to not present 
the university's case while nonpar-
ties were present. 

T he media's presence, Silbaugh 
insisted, was a violation of stu-
dents' rights to privacy as stated in 
the student conduct code. 

"It seems to me that what is 
really going on is that they won't 
stop until we're found guilty," 
Liddle said. "As long as the rules 
are out the window, they might as 
well just declare us guilty and get it 

over with." 
Parisa Baharian, the presiding 

member of the judicial board, 
upheld the board's admission of 
media into the hearing when chal-
lenged by Si lba ugh at Wednesday's 
proceedings. 

In a pre-hearing meeting May 
20, the board made a decision 
effectively denying the administra-
tion 's decision to disallow media 
into the proceedings. 

Aguilar is pushing to resume 
UCSD's case against The Koaill 
before the completion of spring 
quarter, the email stated, where the 
hearing wiU be closed to all nonpar-
ties, including the campus media.

Festivities raise racial awareness 
Second annual Raza Celebration brings South 
American culture to campus through music, dance 
By BRIAN LAunR 
Contributing Writer 

Performances of Ballet 
Folklorico and Danza Azteca 
highlighted the second annual 
Raza Celebration held May 23 in 
the Price Center as part of Raza 
Awareness Week. 

Sponsored by T hurgood 
Marshall College'S Dean of 
Student Affairs O ffice, the event 
was designed to bri ng attention 
to the culture and heritage of 
native peopl es of South 
America. 

"[T he point of the Raza 
Celebration] is to educate people 
about the natives from South 
America: their culture, their tradi-
tion, their history," said Ashanti 
Houston-Hands, dean of student 
affairs at Marshall college. "We 
think it's important to take time 
out to do that, to recognize their 
contributions. " 

The celebration started with a 
dance performance by Hilltop 
High School Ballet Folk16rico. 
The high school group, which 
currendy has about 200 mem-
bers, performed while dressed in 
traditional vibrant attire. 

Described by organizers as "a 
celebration of life in movement, 
music and color," Ballet

RaZI Celebration: Cultural dancers perform in the Price Center Plaza as part 
of the second annual Raza Celebration on Thursday aftemoon. 
Aztec rituals, as well as depictions 
of important events from Mexican 
history. The dances performed 
Thursday represented the tradi-
tional dances of four different 
Mexican states, according to 
Ballet Folk16rico adviser 
Hortenisa Bryan. 

UCSD's Danza Azteca, a group 
dedicated to learning more about 
Aztec culture, made a spiritual 
contribution to the celebration. 
Formed earlier this year with 
three founding members, the

Policy: 
Saf~ty is one of the 
main concerns 
Continued from page 1 
ners would be allowed to post only 
one, must check out a poster sleeve 
and must hang their poster. sleeved, 
in a designated location in the Price 
Center. 

As the policy is currently 
worded, all posters displayed 
must be event-related, stating the 
location, date and time of an 
event as well as the sponsoring 
organization. 

One of the main concerns the 
policy was drafted to address is 
safety. 

"Banners often times are weight-
ed with sticks or rocks or wadded up 
newspapers taped to them, and we've 
had incidents where they have actu-
ally fallen on people," said Lynn 
Cacha, the Price Center's assistant 
director of operations. 

"There was actually a full soda 
can that fell on someone's head 
because it fell off of a banner." 

The A.S. programming office is 
concerned that event publicity will 
be severely limited by the new pol-
icy. 

"It is hard enough to publicize 
events already - coming down on 
the posting in the Price Center I 
think is an absolute disaster. 
Marketing sta tistics have shown 
that you need to see something 
seven ti me before you recognize it 
as an event, in any media," said 
Bianca Daly, publicist for the A.S. 
programming office. 

If enacted, the new policy would 
be amendable, Cacha said. 

"We said one (banner] at first, 
but it was with the understanding 
that there is going to be a trial-and-
error process to see if one was not 
enough or if students wanted to 
post more than one. Obviously, 
probably, we wouldn't have all 20 
banner sleeves up at a any given 
time. so there would be some flexi-
bility there," Cacha said. 

Flyer posting would also be limit-
ed to one flyer per column or area of 
the Price Center. The new mandate 
was proposed to ·make posting more 
fair for all organizations. Cacha said, 

"It was so that people weren't 
having these posting wars or trying 
to post over each other and people 
geTting upset that either their post-
ings were torn down or someone 
posted on top of theirs, if we just 
generically say that we would like 
to limit it to just one or two per 
location then hopefully people will 
be courteous and allow others to 
post," Cacha said. 

University Centers' publicity 
department is concerned that this 
new single flyer policy won't address 
the issue of tearing down flyers, but 
will make the situation worse. 

"Posters get tom down and post-
ed over anyway - if we are only 
allowed one it is going to be so dif-
ficult to get the word out," Daly 
said. 

The proposed policy and proce-
dures also address the issue of 
"blue forming." Currently, student 
organizations must begin the blue-
form process to use programming 
areas at least two weeks prior to an 
event. The new policy would 
increase the preparation time to 
five weeks. 

The goal of the new blue-form 
process is to be able to enact a wait-
list option for high-demand pro-
gramming areas. This wait-list 
option is meant to "serve the high-
est number of student organiza-
tions possible 0 they can do their 
events," Cacha said. 

Before any new procedure or 
policy is enacted, it must first be 
approved by the University Centers 
Advisory Board. The policy will be 
discussed and voted on at the 
UCAB meeting June 3. 

"I think there are some definite 
issues that need to be worked out," 
said UCAB chair James Lynch. "1 
think the proposal has some flaws. 
UCAB will probably hear some 
good ideas &om council about what 
to do."

Gene-therapy trial for 
leukemia launched May 22 

A Phase II gene-therapy clinical trial for patients 
with chronic lymphocytic leukemia was launched 
Mwy 22 by researchers at the Rebecca and John 
Moores UCSD Cancer Center in conjunction with 
San Diego-based Tragen Pharmaceuticals, previously 
known as Immunogenex, Inc. 

The 40 patients in the study received infusions of 
their own leukemia cells that were genetically modi-
fied to induce a cancer-killing response In their 
immune systems. 

The research is based on promising results from 
a previous UCSD study in which 11 patients were 
each treated with a modified version of their own 
leukemia cells. In that Phase I study, the immune 
response prompted by the modified cells destroyed 
both the harmless modified cells and the active 
leukemia cells. 

The Phase II study is designed to determine 
whether multiple injections will maintain low 
leukemia cell counts for a longer period. The 
research project is being led by an associate profes· 
sor of clinical mediCine at UCSD's School of 
Medicine, M, Wayne Seville, The concept of the 
approach for modified cell injections was created in 
the UCSD laboratory of Thomas Kipps. 

CLL is a chronic disease in which immune cells 
in the body accumulate because they do not die, 
thus rendering the patient suspect to diseases. Its 
cause is unknown, 

UC Santa Cruz to receive 
renowned photo archive 

UC Santa Cruz Mil receive the entire archive 
accumulated by renowned nature photographer 
and environmentalist Philip Hyde over his 5(}year 
career. 

The donated archive, which consists of prints, 
negatives, field notes and correspondence, is worth 
over $1 million, 

Hyde began photographing nature during his first 
trip to Yosemite National Park In 1938. He jOined the 
Sierra dub in the early 1950s and used his large-for· 

ma~ black-and-white photos to support the organi-
zation's conservation efforts. 

The Philip Hyde PhotographiC Archive will be 
housed in Special Collections at the UCSC Library. 

New evidence found to 
validate dwarf galaxies 

Evidence that galaxies are surrounded by halos 
containing hundreds of dwarf galaxies was discov· 
ered by astrophysicists Neal Dalal of UCSD and 
Christopher Kochanek of the Harvard-Smithsonian 
Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass. 

Their discovery strongly supports the theory that 
most of the matter in the universe is in the form of 
dark, which is undetected, slow-moving partides. 
The conclusion is based on an analysis of the gravi· 
tationallensing of light from distant galaxies by Inter-
vening galaxies. 

The model provided by' Dalal and Kochanek pre-
dicts that large galaxies hke the Milky Way should 
have numerous small satellite galaxies around 
them. 

The discovery is described in the June 10 issue 
of The Astrophysical Journal. 

New worm research may lead 
to medical advances 

UC Davis researchers have found a gene in 
the nematode worm, Caenorhabditis elegans, that 
may aid researchers in studying the human gene 
that causes dystonia, a disabling neurologicar dis· 
ease. , 

Dystonia causes muscle contractions that 
force the body into abnormal and painful pas· 
tures, The disease is second only to Parkinson's 
Disease in numbers of people who suffer from it, 
aHecting about half a million people in the 
United States and Canada. Scientists are not 
sure what causes dystonia and only milder types 
can be treated. 

An assistant professor of molecular and cell bioi· 
ogy at UC Davis, Lesilee Rose, discovered the worm 
gene, OOC·S. A database search showed that the 
protein that OOC -5 produces is related to the 
human protein found in neNe cells of runans with 
the early onset of Dystonia. 

Rose's lab has received a $43,325 grant from the 
dystonia Medical Research Foundation. The lab 
plans on researching how OOC-5 interacts Nth 
adler proteins in !he wonn to show how Iunan 
gene distortion lead to dystoRa.

CHARGERS 
THREATEN TO 
MOVE TO THE 
GREENER 
PASTURES OF A 
NEW STADIUM 
IN LOS 
ANGELES, 
THEN GOOD 
RIDDANCE 

By GEOFF DIETRICH 
Senior Staff Writer 

The San Diego Chargers recently 
decided to move their training camp from 
RIMAC field to a new facility in Carson, 
Calif. Now there is widespread specula-
tion about whether the team will do more 
than just make a summer home in Los 
Angeles. 

Just over a week ago, the Anschutz 
Entertainment Group proposed a plan to 
build a state-of-the-art football stadium 
adjacent to the Staples Center in Los 
Angeles - contingent upon a National 
Football League team moving to Los 
Angeles to play in it . 

A few days prior to AEG's announce-
ment, the Chargers hired La Jolla lawyer 
and political adviser Mark Fabinai to 
spearhead the Chargers' efforts to work 
with San Diego City Hall to keep the team 
in San Diego. 

Fabinai told the San Ditgo Union- . 
Tribunt that his job is "to do everything 
possible to see that the Chargers remain in 
San Diego, while remaining economically 
competitive with the other teams in the 

league . ~ 
It appears the only way the Chargers 

will stay in San Diego, however, is to be 
assured the team makes more money. As 
far as modern professional sports go, the 
sure-fire way to make more money is to 
have luxury boxes - and lots of them. 

The proposed L.A. stadium reportedly 
will have 200 luxury boxes at over 
$100,000 per season . That figure is far 
more than the going price for the facilities 

currently at Qualcomm Stadium - rest in 
peace, Jack Murphy. 

To keep the Chargers economically 
competitive in San Diego, the team will 
need more luxury boxes. The Q is maxed 
out on the luxury box &ont, so a new facil-
ity is presumably needed. 

It is not out of the realm of possibilities 
that a professional sports owner would ask 
the citizens of the city to chip in and help 
build a new stadium; this happens almost 
monthly across the country. 

If San Diego Chargers owner Alex 
Spanos wants to move his team north to 
Los Angeles because he thinks he can make 
more money, then he should go for it. San 
Diegans and football fans should know 
very well by now that the Chargers are just 
not worth it. 

The thinking goes as follows: Tax 
money could be spent to help pay for the 
stadium and a new stadium is needed 
because luxury boxes are needed. But how 
many taxpayers will actually ever set foot in 
the luxury boxes? The going rate for luxu-
ry boxes at the Q is $5,000 to 514,000 per 
game and 550,000 to 5135,000 for the sea-
son . Maybe the owners and players' agents 
will use them, but for the most part, the 
tax-paying citizens of San Diego will not. 

Just as the Chargers do not entertain 
their fans during their eight home games 
per year, San Diego mayor Dick Murphy 
should not entertain any ideas for a new 
stadium built with public money. 

It's not that San Diegans don't like the 
Chargers: Everybody loves Junior Seau 
and generally likes the rest of the crew. But 
it is time citizens stop putting up with 

helping to pay for the building of liaciJities 
for billionaire owners where millionaire 
players play and working stifli lib us c:an 
barely eYeIt afford ro pan and bay. beer. 

Of course, this is based on the IIIUIDp-
tion that anybody would like cO go to a 
Chargers game in the first ~ BaaIpt 
for when the Raiders come to totm. paaa 
are never sold out because ~ ~OII 
has not put a decent product OIl the Seld 
for a long time. . 

The positive externalia. VI having a 
sports team - principal~ the eoUective 
feeling oflride when the commQPity ral-
lies aroun the team - do not come close 
to the fiscal cost of taxpqer IIIppon for a 
new stadium. That money. DO matter how 
little, is best spent by the citizens. If they 
really wanted to support the team, they 
could buy tickets, luxury boxes, merchan-
dise, advertising or send money direCtly to 
the team. 
. At least when the Padres wanted tax-
payers to split the bill for a stadium, they 
were winning, which is the secret to per-
suading a wary public of paying for a new 
stadium. The Chargers have failed miser-
ably in on-field performance and therefore 
have very little leverage when they say, "If 
you don't build it, we will be forced to 
leave town." 

If we are going to be taxed, it had bet-
ter be for something more than a work-
place for a losing football team. 

We could get more for our tax money, 
such as better training for the San Diego 
Police Department in the benefits of non-
lethal self-defense for officers. San 
Diegans are a&aid to do yard work -

TUESDAY, MAY 28, 2002 

holding branches, rocks, bricks - for fear 
of being shot dead by police. Over the last 
few years, the San Diego Police 
Department has been trigger-happy 
.-inst inefficiendy armed individuals. 

The tax money or bonds could instead 
be used to fix failing schools, the city's 
decrepit sewer system and inefficient pub-
lic transportation. . 

Even if the Chargers do move to L.A., 
they will likely not find the fiscal success 
they are hoping for. First off, Angelenos 
are not clamoring for a new team. In fact, 
they know they are lucky to be able to 
watch the day's best games on television 
instead of the local team. 

Second, there are more Raider-loving, 
Charger-hating fans than Charger fans in 
the area. If the team does leave, we should 
expect it to pull an AI Davis in 10 years and 
retreat to San Diego like a 19-year-old 
Midwestern farmer's daughter who had her 
dreams of fame and fortune crushed in the 
harsh realities of La-La Land. 

The Spanos family has done some nice 
things for San Diego and UCSD, such as 
financing the athletic facilities north of 
RIMAC field. However, not asking the cit-
izens of San Diego to foot the bill for 
building a billionaire a stadium for his mil-
lionaire employees would be, by far, the 
best thing he could do. 

Better yet, Spanos could buck the trend 
of owners holding cities hostage for new 
stadiums and put his construction knowl-
edge to good use, building the stadium 
himself. 

Now that would be something I would 
pay to see.

Fatness: nature or nurture? A visit to Tijuana 
exposes crooked cops

appreciation of u.s. civil rights 

Societal tendency to overeat leads to obesity 
By CHRIS TAYLOR 
Contributing Writer 

"I want an extra-large, caramel 
blended frappe with extra 
whipped cream and extra, extra 
caramel," says the woman order-
ing her drink at the counter of the 
coffee shop where I work. 

I turn roward the blenders and 
begin to ooze the caramel into the 
cup. Behind me, I hear her say, 
"Ohmigosh, I walk to class every 
day and look how fat I am still." 

I pretend to ignore her state-
ment and finish making her drink. 
When I call out the drink, the 
woman gives me a cold stare. 

"Uh ... I need more caramel in 
this," she says. With my fake 
smile, I lather more caramel into 
her drink, which has more calories 
and sarurated fat than a Big Mac, 
even without the extra whipped 
cream and caramel. Her boyfriend 
comes up and says, "Is that good?" 

"Well, it's not really sweet 
enough," she replies, and they 
walk out the door. 

She will be back tomorrow. She 
comes in every day. The next cus-
romer gets the exact same drink. 
There are dozens each day, and this 
is a coffee shop. Obviously, this 
reckless abandonment of a healthy 
lifestyle extends far beyond coffee. 

Our society, which endorses 
sickening diets and lazy habits, has 
allowed excessive weight to 
become an epidemic. Every year, 
the average weight of Americans 
nears obesity. Here are a few sta-
tistics to wrap your mind around. 

It is no secret that the United 
States is very close to the top of 
the "World's Most Overweight" 
list in every category, from age to 
race to gender. The most recent 
study conducted by the World 
Health Organization states that 27 
percent of children in the United 
States age 10 and under are obese. 

The Institute of Medicine 
announced that in 1995,59 percent 
of U .S. adul[S were obese, and the 
numbers have climbed since then. 
Nearly 300,000 deaths each year in 
the United States are ca used by 
complications due to obesity. 

And while most geneticists say 
there is a strong connection 
between an individuals genes and 
his or her propensity to gain weight, 
they all agree that obesity is largely 
a repercussion of our society'S ten-
dency to maintain appalling eating 
habits and spend hours in front of 
the television. The National Health 
Institute declared that the rise in 
time spent in &ont of the television 
is nearly proportional to the rise in 
percentage of obese adults. 

The saddest truth is that while 
geneticists and pharmaceutical 
companies crank out new ideas for 
medicinal treatments, our society 
looks more and more for the quick 
answer to excessive weight. 

Americans spend 533 billion 
every year on diets, health clubs 
and surgical procedures to reduce 
their weight quickly. The NIH 
reports that only 15 percent of 
U .S. adults engage in strenuous 

~ctivity for at least half an hour, 
three days per week. The amount 
of strenuous activity recommend-
ed is less than the time spent in 
lectures for one course per week. 

It is true that many people are 
prone to obesity. It is large.ly con-
sidered a form of disease that can 
afflict people against their will. 
For them, it is extremely difficult 
to maintain fitness. Their condi-
tion, like other inherited condi-
tions, is unforrunate, and I do not 
suggest that these people are at 
fault for their siruation. 

Their condition, however, is 
less common than most people 
think. The number of people inca-
pable of physical fitness is a tiny 
fraction compared to those who 
are perfectly capable of physical 
fitness but refuse to try.

I'm now convinced that those 
ranting about how they consider 
the United States the devil incar-
nate have never been victims of 
police brutality in Mexico. 

Ever since Tijuana police 
roughed me up because I was 
annoyed that someone had stolen 
from me, I can say with more con-
viction than ever that the United 
States is the greatest country in the 
world. 

A little background is in order 
here. Upon leaving Safari, a 
Tijuana night dub, I agreed to pur-
chase a flower from a girl standing 
outside for 52. Admittedly, it was 
ignorant of me to give her a $20 bill 
and expect change, but I suppose 
that's an American concept. 

I argued with her for about 5 
minutes before I called over a Safari 
security guard who, sure enough, 
took her side. So, being the srub-
born guy I am, I argued with a 250-
pound bouncer for about five min-
utes as my friends tried to drag me 
into a taxicab. 

The thing is, it wasn\ about the 
money; it was, and still is, the prin-
ciple. I work hard for my money, so 
it's my humble belief that it 's wrong 
when other people steal it from me 
- one of those weird Republica n 
concepts most people wouldn't 
really understand. 

In any case, I was irate when the 
security guard snatched the flower 
I was about to give to my friend, 
returned it to the vendor, told her 
to leave, and told me to "go home. " 
My indignation kicked in as I 
explained to that guy, from the bot-
tom of my heart, that he was a col-
orful expletive that rhymes with 
"ducker. " 

To be frank, he didn't appreciate 
it one bit. 

I think he was trying to shove 
his hands through my rib cage, but 
I'm happy to say that he failed . 
Though somewhat bruised, my ribs 
are still intact. 

Of course, two of Tijuana's 
finest then proceeded to rough me 
up a bit, but I was happy they 
allowed me to fl ee to the taxica b

Morals should not come from religions alone 
Religious edicts on behavior change with time and have many sources 
By SIMONE SANTINI 
Senior Staff Writer 

There are two basic classes of 
arguments that I have heard pro-
posed in defense of religious 
beliefs. 

First, there are theological argu-
ments, which aim essentially at 
establishing that this or that reli-
gious belief is true, in some sense of 
the word . I have expressed my 
reservations about these arguments 
on other occasions and I will not 

. return to the subject here . 
Then there are those that I will 

call social arguments, which try to 
establish the social value of religious 
beliefs - that is, they try to estab-
lish that, independent of theological 
plausibility, religion is useful to soci-
ety. A large part of these arguments 
rests on the idea of morality. 

They say that without a reli-
gious underpinning, there is no 
possible II priori basis for morality; 
consequently, all moral prescrip-
tions would degenerate into the 
most abject relativism. Religious 
moral prescriptions, on the other 
hand, come direcdy from God and 

are, because of this, absolute - if 
not quite a Kantian categorical 
imperative, at least absolute for the 
members of a particular religion. 

In my view, the laner position is 
mistaken in two complementary 
and probably related aspects. On 
one hand, it overestimates the sta-
bility and inevitability of religious 
morality; on the other hand, it 
overestimates the relativism of any 
cultural form of morality. 

Religious morality is much 
more variable than it is made out to 
be, and much more adaptable to 
mutable social circumstances. 

Just to take a few examples, 
abortion at any time is currently 
considered a sin, and therefore 
immoral by most Christian denom-
inations. However, until about 150 
years ago, aU major churches 
unquestioningly accepted abortion 
before "quickening," roughly at the 
end of the second trimester. 

These days, we consider money 
loans to be a normal part of business 
activity, but for a long time, the 
Catholic church considered loaning 
money at interest a sin. 

The other overstatement - that 

a cultural notion of morality would 
invariably lead to relativism - is 
more interesting. It is certainly true 
that if we consider morali ty as a 
cultural notion and take a syn-
chronic point of view, there is rea-
son to believe that, say, considering 
murder as moral would make as 
much sense as considering it 
immoral and that any cultural 
notion of morality is relativistic. 

Looking at things diachronically 
(i.e. historically), however, the pic-
ture changes considerably. A simple 
and by no means complete model 
can be postulated, viewing morality 
as an evolutionary property of a cul-
ture, which interacts with its social 
environment much like an animal 
species evolves in an ecosystem. 

The survival of the culture 
requires that certain stable rela-
tions exist among the members of a 
community and consequently that 
moral norms take certain directions 
rather than others. 

To stay with the example above, 
it is perfectly possible to conceive 
of a culture that encourages mur-
der, but it is just as obvious that 
such a culrure would not survive for 

a long time. 
Simi lal ly, a society in which incest 

is not immoral would degenerate 
into disconnected groups of families 
closed into themselves and the social 
exchanges that are necessary for the 
formation of larger groups would be 
impossible. It is interesting to note in 
this respect that, according [0 
anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss, 
in several "primitive" tribes, incest is 
not seen as immoral, but as socially 
ridiculous. 

Wi th the necessary addi tions 
and clarifications, cultural evolu-
tion explains how a laic, strictly cul-
tural morality can arise without 
being completely arbitrary. 
Nevertheless, evolution based on 
pure functionalism is far too sim-
plistic to explain even partially the 
detailed aspects of morality. 

Endless complications arise. For 
one thing, morality is often con-
cerned with the long-term benefits 
of the group rather than with the 
short-term benefits to the individ-
ual and, as a consequence, a system 
of enforcement must be created. 
Police enforcement works only 
partially, while religion (with its 

idea of an endlessly watching God) 
and tradition offer, in many cases, 
an ideal enforcement framework. 

With religion and tradition, 
however, comes a considerable 
moral inertia: Moral precepts tend 
to remain the same in the face of 
drastic changes in the condition 
that caused them to be created to 
begin with. 

Examples of this phenomenon 
abound , from the resistance to 
painless child delivery in the 19th 
centu ry to the permanence of 
ancient norms of sexual conduct in 
an age of diffused and safe contra-
ceptives. 

Of course, this model is still par-
tial, and I doubt that a model sim-
pler than the complete culrural 
anthropology of a society can 
explain all aspects of morali ty. 

The point, however, is that 
there are ways to explain how cer-
tain moral codes are common to 
almost all populations on Earth, 
and how morality can be more than 
just a system of arbitrary conven-
tion without resorting to the meta-
physical scaffolding that religions 
encourage us to accept uncritica lly.

Editor: 
I am writing in response to yOUT 

editorial, "Team mascots should 
not stir offense," from the May 6 
issue of Tht UCSD Guardill1l. 

For a non-native to tell me that 
I should not be offended by a car-
toonish depiction of an American 
Indian "warrior" mascot who runs 
around threatening the opposing 
teams is like a man telling me (as a 
woman) what it feels like to be 
pregnant. 

How in -the world could you 
know how it feels? If people of 
European descent were offended, I 
would not support mascots based 
on European cuI tures any more 
than I would mascots depicting 
native cultures. However, I don't 
think they are entirely comparable 
due to issues such as power, soci-

eta� representation, history of col-
onization and oppression and edu-
cation. 

One of the ugliest things about 
American Indian mascots is that 
they seem to bring to the surface 
many negative stereotypes and mis-
informed ideas about American 
Indian people and their cultures. 
Most schools claim to use their 
mascot as a token of respect, to 
honor American Indian people and 
their cultures. Few do. 

If I were to parade down a foot-
ball field dressed as a muscular, 
sequined version of the Pope , 
would that be honoring Catholics' 

If you want to value and show 
respect for American Indians, you 
do it according to their definitions 
of value and respect and following 
their cultural protocols . Otherwise, 
you are not showing respect or 
"honoring" American Indians at 
all. 

I am not opposed to mascots if 
they are done in a positive way. For 
example, the Irish Catholic 
founders of the University of Notre 
Dame chose the "Fighting Irish" as 
their mascot. However, the people 
who decide whether it is positive 
has to be the group that is depicted 
- not someone else. If the Irish are 
not offended by their mascots, then 
you don't have a problem. But if 
American Indian people are offend-
ed by thei r mascots - alld yes, we 
are - then you have a problem. 

I can drive through a city where 
the average citizen thinks that there 
aren 't any American Indians in 
Southern California (outs ide the 
Sycuan and Viejas casinos); where 
the only things "Indian" are Jeep 
Cherokees. 

Native people are largely invisi-
ble to people outside our communi-
ties, yet our images, words and cul-
tures are taken by the dominant 
society and used for profit and 
entertainment. When we voice our 
opposition, we are almost unilater-
ally dismissed. American Indian 
mascots don't "seem" wrong to 
most people because it has been 
socially acceptable for so long to 
use our names and images that 
most people don't thinlc. twice about

Obesity: 
Genetic causes are not 
an excuse for everyone 
Continued from page 5 

It has come to the poi n t that 
people will attribute a slight weight 
gain enti rely to genetics, while 
they refuse to do any serious exer-
cise. When treated as such, obesity 
slowly loses its potency as an inher-
ited disease, and more people cross 
into the obese category who aren 't 
genetically prone to it. 

It is these people who give rise 
to such alarming statistics: Those 
fortunate enough to be able to lose 
fa t, but do nothi ng about it - and 
then complain . 

It seems as if most Americans 
have given in to the idea that exces-
sive weight is unavoidable and have 
refused to take any action agai nst 
it. Not only is this idea largely 
unfounded, but also very danger-
ous to one's health. To ignore obe-
sity is the same as refusing treat-
ment for an illness. The longer the 
problem lasts, the less likely you 
are to defeat it. 

I am disgusted by how many peo-
ple complain that they do not have a 
"nice body," but do nothing about it. 
It is true that oUT culture idolizes 
emaciated models and muscle-
bound athletes, but those who are 
unwilling to commit 90 minutes per 
week to maintaining fimess should

it. 

Caricatures of "Little Sambo" 
and the "Frito Bandito" have not 
been socially acceptable for some 
time now. How many people need 

not complain if they look nothing . 
like their idols. Most people will 
never achieve the "perfect" body, but 
when they aren 't willing to maintain 
the minimal of health standards, they 
should not be surprised if they are 
categorized as overweight. 

Admittedly, maintaining fitness 
is not an easy chore . Fitness 
requires a commitment and a lot of 
conscious decisions. It requires the 
diligence of a healthy diet. It 
requires aerobic exercise and even 
weight training. It demands leaving 
the television and riding a bike 
eve ry so often to travel. It can be 
time-consuming and may never 
resu] t in abs of steel or firm but-
tocks, but physical fitness is 
undoubtedly achievable. 

In the end, fitness is not a 
requirement for happiness in life. In 
no way is our population forced to 
keep fit. However, it is unwise to 
refuse an attempt at physical fitness. 
Excessive weight is dangerous. 

Furthermore, people could 
keep in shape if they worked out 
for the amount of time they spend 
complaining about it: If anyone is 
unwilling !O at least attempt phys.i-
cal fimess, then he must admit that 
his condition is a logical conclu-
sion , if not desired. 

There are many avenues scien-
tists will use to fight obesity on a 
genetic level. While they do that, I 
suggest that we consider switching 
to nonfat products and going light 
on the caramel. 

to say mascots are offensive before 
people listen to us? 

Freedom of speech and state-
ment are tempered only by civil 
rights protections. Racial mascots 
are a civil rights issue, and just as 
with slavery, the "majority" is not 
always in agreement about what is 
moraJiy and legally right.

You can imagine how happy [ 
was when I crossed the border; I 
once again enjoyed American civil 
rights, including my right to 
object when others steal from me. 
Thus, I no longer had to worry 
about standi ng by helplessly and 
watch the state steal from me -
until April 15 , anyway, but that's 
not quite so bad. 

I suppose I found it so infuriat-
ing that the police would stand by 
and watch someone steal from me 
and then punish me for my vocal 
indignance because such outrages 
simply do not occur in the United 
States - whether you're a citizen 
or not. 

Although liberals like to 
believe otherwise, everyone in the 
United States - from tax-paying 
citizens to foreign tourists and 
students to illegal immigrants -
is entitled to the exact same civi l 
rights. And that's what's so great 
about this country. 

For instance, if I'm stopped at 
a traffic light on La Jolla Village 
Drive and see that bouncer cross-
ing the street, the fact thai I'm a 
tax-paying U .S. citizen and he 
isn't does not entitle me to mali-
ciously slam my foot on the accel-
erator and run him over. The state 
would prosecute me and he would 

sue me - and rightfull y so. 
Someone's Status as an ill egal 

immigrant should not justify act 
of brutaliry, because our 
Constitution is based on the prin-
ciple that everyone is equal in the 
eyes of the law. 

Your average fanatical liberal 
will probably argue that the arrest 
and deportation, or denial of in-
state tuiti on, of illegal immigrants 
refutes my claim. Such arguments 
have always been completely 
unfounded , however, because 
there is equal protection under 
immigration laws. 

Therefore, if anyone can dig 
up some dirt proving that I am, in 
fact, in tltis country illegally, the 
state would be more than justified 

Although liberals like 
to believe otherwise, 

everyone in the 
United States - from 
tax-paying citizens to 

foreign tourists and 
students to illegal 

immigrants - is 
entitled to the exact 

same civil rights. 

in fo rcing me to reimburse the 
taxpayers for my claiming in-state 
tuition before deporting me. 

Those same people will justify 
my state-initiated mugging by 
pleading incessantly for us to pity 
the poor girl, whose economic 
condition is -like the rest of the 
world's problems - the fault of 
the mean old United States. I 
personally feel that such argu-
ments are laughable, to say the 
least. 

Yes, I am an American, and 
consequently 'enjoy a higher stan-
dard of living than the average 
Mexican. That does not mean, 

OPINION 7 

however, that my presence - or 
that of any other American, for 
that matter - docs not intrinsi-
cally obligate us to function 3S a 
piggy bank whenever we cros~ the 
border. If some people feel that 
there is such an obligation, then 
how about if Americans were to 
StOP spending money in Me~co: I 
don't suppose we have an obliga-
tion to conrribure to their econo-
my, either. 

The cumulative wealth of the 
United States is the sum of the 
wealth of its residents. Therefore, 
because Illy Lockian principles 
dictate that the individua l should 
not be coerced into fo rfeiting to 
any body that which he or she has 
rightfully earned, the United 
States should not - despite what 
a vocal, ideological minority 
believes - be obligated to share 
the wealth it has earned WIth the 
rest of the world . 

The fact that the United States 
chooses to donate billions of dul-
lars in aid each year to impover-
ished countries shows the gen-
erosiry of this coun try and it peo-
ple. Those who disagree, however, 
are morc than welcome to venmre 
south of the border with all tllcir 
possessions in a crusade to return 
the wealth they feel they, being 
part of the American economy, 
have kept from others; after all , 
this is a free country. 

An old cliche says a Ii beral is a 
conservative who has never been 
mugged , and I've always found it 
amusing, but more so now than 
ever. It's so easy for some people 
to sit atop their ivory towers and 
criticize America for what they 
consider are its faults, yet remain 
totally oblivious to its virtues as a 
civilization. 

Perhaps such "progressives" 
should do some traveling outside 
the pristi ne halls of academia, and 
maybe they'll learn that the 
United States has already made 
quite a bit of progress.

Center of attention: A group of children gather around a goat at the children's 
petting zoo at the San Diego Zoo on Memorial Day. 

The agreement calls for 
raises of up to 38 percent for 
some nurses, according to a 
statement from CNA. Pay 
increases under the new 
agreement will be deter-
mined by seniority rather 
than evaluations by man -
agers . The Unive~sity of 
California will still be able to 
reward job performance 
through lump-sum bonuses, 
according to a statement 
from the universi ty. 

The agreement also calls 
for the two sides to form 
joint committees at each 
medical center to work 
together in creating accept-
able staffing ratios. 
Currently there is legislation 
at the state level to mandate 
nurse to patient ratios. 

Although the agreement 
still needs to be rati fi cd by 
the nurses on June 3 and 
June 4, CNA formally with -
drew its plans for the one-
day strike.

TRADITION: POLO~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Call the cavalry: A horse-borne competitor leaves an opponent in the dust while pursuing the goal during a match on Monday afternoon. 

BY SARAH HASS AlNE STAFF WRITER 
PHOTOS BY ANNAMACMURDO 

U CSD is known for water polo, and every kid is familiar with Marco Polo - but polo 011 horses is usually associated more 
with British royalty and New England 

debutantes than with Southern California college 
students. 

H owever, just last quarter UCSD has started to 
offer students polo classes in hopes of starting a 
team in the future. Otller San Diego t:olleges, such 
as San Diego State University and University of San 
Diego, will begin offering classes next fall with sim-
ilar goals. 

A very fast-paced game with the usual objective 
of getting the ball into the goal, polo is played in a 
huge grassy arena, and all players are atop 1,000-
pound, living, breathing animals. 

Polo games have four quarters called "chukkers." 
Each chukka is seven-and-a-half minutes long, and 
at each break, players get a new horse to ride. 
Players hold a long mallet in their right hand and 
the reins in their left hand . 

Though polo in this country has an image o f 
being for th e upper crust, Torn Goodspeed, general 
manager of the San Diego Polo Club and one of the 
new class' teachers, emphasized that polo is for all 
people, and that it is one of the only sports where 
both men and women can equally compete and play 
together. 

He explained that polo dates back to ancient 
Persia. It was used to develop equestrian skills in the 
military, where horsemanship was important. Later, 
polo was used for officer training; an officer's true 
personality would be gauged by his ability to play. 
Polo used to be in the Olympics and is currently in 
the process of being reinstated , according to 
Goodspeed. 

Erin Gilmore, a sophomore at Mira Costa 
College, is the collegiate coordinator here in San 
Diego. As a polo player, her job is to increase inter-
est among college students to later train and form 
teams to compete against one another locally, as 
well as with other universities in annual regional 
competitions. 

Goodspeed, who has taught children as young as 
4 and seniors as old as 65 how to play polo, really 
enjoys working with college-age students. 

"At that age, they are like Jello," he said. "They 
physically adapt coordination, and polo requires 
good hand-eye coordination." 

[s a polo national championship in UCSD's 
future? Whoa there! Before winning any national 
championships, UGSD's objective now is to just 
"spark interest," as Gilmore said, and simply learn 
how to play polo. 

FIve UCSD women signed up for the class in the 
beginning of th is quarter, all new to the sport e.xcept 
onc. G ilmore explai ned tllat fo r six weeks, the 
young W0111e11 have had weekly practices every 
Tuesday n ight. Practices were held at tll~ San 
Diego Polo Club and were taught by Goodspeed 
with Gilmo re as his assistant. 

Gilmore said tlley "didn 't just teach them how to 
play polo, but also how to saddl e. o r ' tack up: a 
horse, and to groom a horse." 

She continued to add that she thought they 
"liked it a lot." 

Muir sophomore C arly Ross sai d that she found 
out about the class through RIMAe's recreati o n 
class catalog. 

"I have always wanted to take rid ing lessons, and 
it just seemed like a lot o f fun," Ross said. 

Sonia Davis, an assistant adminis trator at UCS D 
who is taking the class, said all of the m worked hard 
and "learned together." 

Ross said at first it was vety frus trati ng. 
"I could hold the mallet, and J coul d hit the ba ll, 

but it was hard getting the horse to do as you want 
it to," Ross said . "But the classes were good because 
they just threw us our there, and we just learned ." 

Davis explained that she tllought she would be a 
better polo player then she was. 

"It was very challenging trying to hit the ball and 
also maneuve r a horse," Davis said. 

The challenge, G ilmore explained , comc~ frOI1l 
the frenetic nature of the ga me: N o t only do yo u 
have to watch for the ball , but :tlso wa tch your 
horse, keep track of wh en : it is going and watd ; the 
other players on the fi eld . 

"It definitel y requires a lot of coordinatioll- and 
talking'" Gilmore said . "Talking is very important. 
On the field, we are always just talking and ye lling 
at each other, like to see if your tea mmate is going 
for the ball or not." 

She added that polo is very much contact sport 
and that players can fall off their horses. She also 
described the act of "riding off" in polo, whi ch is 
where two players arc riding side by side; one ca n 
push their opponent off his or her ho rse, or steer a 
horse into them. 

"It is a very fast-paced game, and pl ayers can fi de 
as faSt they want," Gilmore said. 

Good~peed said that the girls rode on "wonder-
ful horses that are quiet by nature." 

Polo horses are calm and well -trained because of 
their many disciplines; for example, they do not 
mind being hit by the ball.

Student earns P.-FLAG scholarship 
for achievements, educational goals 
$1000 award commemorates late teacher 
By PAVNI MEHROTRA 
Staff Writer 

Talking to her on the phone, she 
seemed just like any other sopho-
more on campus - patiently await-
ing her one day off while I decided 
to steal a few hours of her time for 
an interview. 

UCSD studeIll Diana Chase, 
however, is anything but ordinary. 

Chase's involvement as a men-
tor and volunteer at West Hills 
High School makes her stand out 
as an involved member of the com-
munity. 

Additionally, her position as 
secretary in the Gay Youth Alliance 
and her goals of teaching high 
school English to promote "more 
productive learning environments" 
made her the top choice amongs-
many qualified candidates for the 
Mary Wagner Memorial 
Scholarship. 

Chase received a $1,000 schol-
arsh ip May 27 in the First 
Unitarian Universalist Church 
from the San Diego chapter of 
Parents, Families and Friends of 
Lesbians and Gays. 

The scholarship is in its third 
year and is annually given to a stu-
dent who focuses on 
gay/lesbian/transgendcr/bisexual 
education. 

The scholarship is in honor of 
lary Wagner, who passed away in 

1999. Her partner and family creat-
ed it as a tribute to her life. 

"The scholarship honors those 
who strive to educate. Diana's 
involvement with education and 
her achievements made her our top 
candidate," said P-FLAG chair 
Olivia Dorman. 

The scholarship requires candi-
dates to fill out an application avail -
able in the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual , 
Transgender Resource Office, sub-

Tyler Huff/Guardian 

UCSD Scholar: Diana Chase. 
mit an essay, along with their 
SA.T. scores, GPA, and two letters 
of recommendation. 

"The process helps us learn 
more about the student and their 
involvement from their own words 
and eKperiences rather than by 
numbers and facts," Dorman said. 
"Diana received this scholarship on 
her own merit, and as an excellent 
applicant, she was selected by our 
chapter." 

Chase's essay caught the eye of 
the evaluation committee, mainly 
because of her topic and involve-
ment. 

"I wrote about one of the girls 
that 1 work with when [ tutor. She 
had a lot of pressure about her sex-
uality, and she was getting ques-
tioned by her grandparents," Chase 
said. "She started to pretend she 
was straight, and I found this com-
pletely wrong. I wanted to help, 
and this was one of the most mem-
orable experiences." 

Chase's future goals include

Ciet Up, UCSD, or 
face consequences 

hecoming a teacher, first by apply-
ing to the Credentials Program on 
campus at UCSD for 2003-2004. 
Currently enrolled in two Teacher 
Education Program, Chase is 
working with one of her high 
school teachers at West Hills from 
whom she also received a lener of 
recommendation. 

"I want to make it easier for kids 
to accept who they are," Chase said. 

Her involvement with youth 
activities add valuable experiences 
to her Ii fe , she said. 

"My main goal is to create a wel-
coming and accepting environment 
so that kids do not think it's wrong 
to feel what they are feeling," Chase 
said. "1 have seen all the pain that 
people go through, and I think that 
if you have support, it makes every-
thing much easier." 

Her vision for support is one 
that she makes a reality every week 
as the secretary of the Gay Youth 
Alliance. The "socia l support" 
group meets once a week to "cre-
ate a safe space for LGBT and 
questioning youth." Chase is 
proud that the organization is "a 
youth-run organization by and for 
the youth ." 

Many have asked her what she 
will do with the money; she said it 
wili go toward "regents' fees." The 
money is given directly to the 
school and Chase is grateful for the 
additional money which wili go to 
her education. 

Regarding UCSD awareness 
and the environment, Chase said 
that "LGBTA is doing a great job 
of promoting awareness and build-
ing a safe place on campus. The 
Out and Proud Week was great." 

A new campus star, Diana Chase 
and her family are excited for her 
award, as well as very proud of her 
achievements and contributions to 
the community. 

'Let there be light' shed on dangers of student apathy 
By ALISON NORRIS 
Editor in Chief 

UCSD currently enrolls 20,212 
undergraduate students. Of tho e 
20,2 12 well-educated movers and 
shakers, I'm willing to bet that a 
scant few know of recent instances 
in which the administration has 
cheaply tried to gut students' rights 
on this campus. And I've begun to 
wonder if those who do know even 
care. 

As co-editor-in-chief of the 
GIID/'dlall, I have caught wind of, 
and have helped publish, numerous 
articles about these instances. 
Often when 11 ,000 copies of the 
big news were being printed for a 
Monday or Thursday morning, I 
wondered if 11IIlybe finally UCSD 
would read the paper the next day, 
and someone - anyone! - would 
stand up for students' fundamental 
rights at UCSD after reading our 
paper. 

After a year of publishing, I'm 
still wondering whether UCSD 
will ever stand up. One thing that's 
dear, however, is that the adminis-
tration certainly isn't afraid to. 

This year, Vice Chance.lior of 
Student Affairs Joseph Watson has-
n't hesitated to take a stand in the 
name of his "causes." Take, for 
example, his all-campus e-mail sent 
during fall quarter, which (0" -

demned humor publication The 
Koala "on behalf of the UCSD 
community" and called its contents 
an "abuse of the fundamental right 
to free speech." 

Of those of us who actually use 
our UCSD e-mail accounts, many 
were likely to have seen that e-mail. 
But where were the demonstra-
tions to protest the fact tha t 
Watson had taken it upon him~e1f 
to condemn onyrbl1lg on our 
behalf? 

Furthermore, remember that 
the "on your beha\r' condemnation 
came from the guy who refused to 
allow the obviously in-demand 
beer ga rden to be a part of 
Muirstock and the UCSD-UC 
Davis rival basketball game. Does 
this sound like the type of campus 
official you feel comfortable having 
speak on your behalf? If so, con-
gratula te yourself on being one 
reason this campus is so dead most 
of the time, barring the annual Sun 
God festival. 

Moreover, did anyone who read 
Watson's condemnation wonder, 
"What the hell is 'an abuse of free 
speech?'" It is undeniable that stu-
dents either have the freedom to 
print their opinions (or jokes, for 
that matter) on this campus, or 
they don't; if a horde of people find 
such opinions or jokes to be repul-
sive, that still doesn 't indicate that 

any abuse of free speech has 
occurred. 

That I heard so few students 
make such arguments, or even crit-
icize Watson's e-mail in any man-
ner, leaves me wondering what it 
will take to get UCSD's head out of 
its ass. 

For all we know, Watson could 
condemn anyon-campus publica-
tion "on behalf of the UCSD COIll-
munity.'· If he did, would UCSD 
still not rare ' Wllere does the buck 
stop, Watson? 1\1 0reovcr, where 
does the buck stop, UCSD? 
Forgive me for being preachy, but 
our fundamental rights are in dan-
ger collectively when free speech is 
condemned - and redefined, reac-
tionary-style - frol11 above. 

In the end, I hope that UCSD 
would have been fired up about 
Watson's language if only because 
it indicates that the administration 
has no fear of students. At many 
campuses, deeming an unpopular 
article of a humor publication an 
abuse of free speech wouldn't be an 
option (think UC Berkeley - or 
any university with a graduate jour-
nalism school or a law school, for 
that matter). However, Watson's e-
mail shows that we have convinced 
the administration of our apathy to 
the point that we are expected to

IIlto lerable issue co ncerning students' 
rights - and an issue equally tolerated by 
the student body: ince fall 2000, if accused 
of academic dishonesty, students are not 
all owed to be represented by legal counsel 
dUring their tria l. 

t\l though students may receive advice

of course, the moment when legal repre-

THE UCSD GUARDIAN TUESDAY, MAY 28, 2002 

Jls as political science professo r Peter Irons 
- who, I might add, has argued before the 

.S. Supreme Court and went to Harva rd 
niversiry Law School. I n!st my' case on 

this point. 
S ttll , Ihere is another indi scretion 

behind UCSD '~ " no lawyers" policy that 
deserves attcntion and has reccived little. 
T here 3rc few other hca~ings, trials or judi-
cial procedures I know of - and let the let-
ters to the editor correct· me by the doze ns 
if I am wrong - in which the accused may 
be denied the right to be represented by an 
atto rney. 

Furthermore, Srudent Poli ci es and 
Judicial Affairs D irector Nick Aguilar 
inserted this no-lawyers clause into the 
UCSD Student Conduct Code after other 
universities ran into trouble when students 
on trial brought qualified attorneys into the 
picture. 

Conclusion: The admini stration and 
Aguilar eem to have banned lawyers from 
representing students in academic dishon-
esty hearings because they are wholly 
afraid of UCSD's "judicial" proceedings 
being subject to the legal world's strict 
scrutiny. 

That being said, I'm left wondering how 
UCSD 's Student Policies and Judicial 
Affairs office can singlehandedly override 
the perhaps fundamental right to an attor-
ney. Let's just say I'm waiting for the day 
that an accused student calls the American 
Civil Liberties Union about this before 
heading to trial. 

That no accused student has done this 
so far (to my perhaps limited knowledge, 
at leas t) only brings the apathy of our stu-
dent body further into the limelight: If we 
fail to care about unethical judicial pro-
ceedings in which our reputations and 
educations are at stake, how might one 
retain any hope for the mood of our stu-
dents toward university officials and their 
parental policies? 

I guess one might reason that spending 
time addressing these topics could jeopar-
dize a student's precious grade point aver-
age, GREIMCATILSAT/DAT scores or 
reputation among friends. Or maybe stu-
dents ' involvement with one or two organi-
zations has prevented their willingness to 
address issues secmingly unrelated to thdr 
group's purpose. 

But whether we 're "Mr. or Ms. 
Involved" or the bioengineering student 
who rarely leaves G ci cI Library, these 
issues and th is apathy re late to all of us. If 
you're still wond ering why or how, UCSD 
is in deeper trouble than I thou ght.

Staff Writer 

For UCSD women's basket-
ball, the move to Division II two 
years ago might have been a diffi-
cult one . But the Tritons have 
gone 28-26 in Division II, and 
much of the credit can be given to 
three seniors who have played 
their last games for UCSD.

Southern Connecticut, North 
Dakota and Seattle Pacific. The 
men's team, which finished 29th 
last year, remained off the leader 
board with no points. 

The third and final day of com-
petition saw Ewanio attempting to 
score points for the men's team, 
which he did as result of his sixth-
place finish. But, both Ewanio and 
Salerno admit that the outcome 
may have been more favorable if 
Mother Nature hadn't interfered. 
Ewanio had thrown 57 feet in the 
preliminary round to qualify him 
for the final round. In the finals, 
Ewanio was warming up just as the 

Musings: 
Rivalries rule sports 
within our country 
Continued from page 16 
between two teams you probably 
don't give a hoot about? We have 
never even had anything close to 
an international rivalty. 

We have international players, 
yes. The NBA is riddled with 
them, as is baseball. Funny, 
though: The NBA's talent comes 
from Europe while baseball draws 
upon Central America and, lately, 
from Japan. 

America takes these players in, 
but never creates cross-national 
competitions with other teams. 
Even many of the leagues abroad 
for ba<ketball, basebalJ and espe-
cially football, are overwhelmed 
with U.S. athletes trying to make it 
to the next level back in the states. 

In sports where teams compete 
internationally, no one cares. 
When the U.S. Eagles, our 
national rugby team, played 
England and South Africa, among 
others, last year, who really cared? 
How many Americans are actually 
going to stay up into the wee 
hours of the night to catch the 
United States play in Japan and 
South Korea in the World Cup? 
Two, maybe three people? 

Having international rivalries 
completely redefines the way a 

Hudec and Maya Fok have all con-
tributed to the Triton attack and 
will be missed, according to coach 
Judy Malone. 

Wortham, a 6-foot center from 
Ceres, Calif., became a part-time 
starter as a junior before working 
her way into the full-time job this 
past season. 

"Danyiel worked very hard to 
improve her game," Malone said . 
"[In the post] she had to battle 
against taller, bigger people every 
night." 

As a senior, Wortham finished 
second on the team in rebounding 
with 6.5 per game and added seven 
points per game. Wortham's hard 
work was rewarded when she was 
named the Tritons' best defensive 
player at the end of the 2002 sea-
son. 

"She was a great position and 
help defender," Malone said. "She 
wasn't the biggest star but she was 
one of those players that is the 
glue that holds the team togeth-
er." 

While Wortham worked hard 
and improved on the court, team-
mate and fellow 6-foot center 
Renee Hudec was working to get 
there. 

As a sophomore, Hudec was 
often the first Triton off the 
bench, but her junior year was 
marred with injuries . After tearing 

first two throwers finished their 
tosses. 

'-"'hen Ewanio was set to throw, 
the officials called the athletes 
indoors because of a storm warn-
ing. After approximately an hour, 
they ended the warning and the 
competitors were let outside, only 
to be recalled minutes later. When 
the meet finally resumed, only one 
thrower improved on his prelimi-
nary mark, perhaps due to the stop-
page, which halted any momentum 
the athletes had, according to 
Salerno. 

Ewanio's best throw of 57 1/4 
was off the 60-4 112 he recorded 
at conference championships to 
qualify him, but he continued his 
winning ways head-to-head 
against Rohde, who finished sev-
enth with a mark of 56-10 3/4. 
Ewanio, who placed fifth last year, 
earned three points to tie UCSD 

sport is played. For instance, the 
rugby ranks abroad are dictated in 
such a way that the season culmi-
nates in the times of international 
play.

her ACL, Hudec made a trip to 
Europe and suffered another set-
back. 

"In Europe, she ruptured her 
patellar tendon," Malone said. 

But that didn't stop her from 
climbing the Eiffel Tower and fin-
ishing her trip before returning to 
the United States to be examined 
by doctors.

with Humboldt State and 
Western Oregon, with Abilene 
Christian narrowly defeating St. 
Augustine's for the team title 91-
88. 

"I was a little disappointed," 
Ewanio said. "1 threw three feet 
under my !personal record), but 
the conditions were bad because 
they stopped us in the middle of 
throwing because a storm was 
coming in. I was all ready to 
throw but they said 'we're going 
to stop for a while .' Other than 
that, I was happy - a two-time 
All-American, which is pretty 
good." 

Despite the turn of events, 
Ewanio said he is not making any 
excuses for himself. 

"Goi ng in, I was hoping to get 
in the top three," Ewanio said. 
"There was a possibility I could 
have gotten first place, but the 

heroes and international plagues. 
The lens through which a player is 
viewed is intensified beyond belief 
when the press of several nations 
searches for cracks in the armor. 

The Tri-nations is JUSt one 
example of such an event. Cricket 
has the same sort of international 
appeal, as does soccer, the grand-
daddy of them all. Countries such 
as Ghana and Nigeria, which 
have dominated the youth world 
cups of the last 20 years, rally 
behind their teams. 

The World Cup has more fans 
than any other sporting event, 
excluding perhaps the Olympics. 
France and England have a soccer 
rivalry that goes back 100 years. 

It is sad that America has none 
of this. We roOt for our teams in 
our sports. Others are welcome to 
appreciate what we have and par-
ticipate in it, but that's it. The 
sports stay in the country.

the mano-a-mano wars of nation-

Its a shame, really: America is

joined her teammates in the final 
game of her senior year in which 
she contributed with five rebounds 
in eight minutes . 

"Renee is the definition of 
courage," Malone said . "Most peo-
ple would have given up in her sit-
uation. She's shown what it means 
to be on a team." 

Playing in only one game dur-
ing her final two years, the center

"She was a good leader and an 
important part of our program," 
Malone said. 

After her sophomore year at 
UC Davis, point guard Fok 
learned that the Aggie basketball 
team didn't have a position for 
her for the following year. Fok 
called Malone and transferred to 
UCSD for her junior year to help 
lead the Tritons to Division II 
success . 

"Maya has a natural exuber-
ance," Malone said. "She's been a

what kind of a point guard we 
want."

Seven athletes compete at track championships 
Five Tritons win All-America honors at nationals held in San Angelo, Texas 
By KEITH DO 
Staff Writer 

UCS D track and field sent 
seven athletes to Texas for the 
, ational Collegiate Athletic 

s OClation Division II 
Championships at Angelo State 
U niversity in San Angelo, with the 
women's tea m finishing tied for 
32 ml overall and the men 's team 
tied for 44th. 

Despite bringing only seven 
athl etes in seven events, five 
Tritons won All-America honors 
(awarded to the top eight fini shers 
in each event). In comparison, 
among the most sizable squads in 
Texas was men's team winner and 
women 's third-place finisher 
,\ bilene Christian University of 
Texas, which sent 33 athletes in 27 
events, in addi tion to its relay 
teams, to the meet. 

"The overall rankings were a lit-
tle misleading," said head coach 
lony Salerno. "/\ couple of points 
wou ld have moved us up to 10th 
place. So the team title doesn't 
meJn a lot unless you have the 
numbers to compete." 

T he women 's team sent five ath-
lere : Audrey Sung in the 3,000 
meters, Clara Wilson in the 400-
meter low hurdles, Megan Bergin 
in the hammer throw, Sara Allsup 
in the discus and Minnie 
Hernandez in the shot put. 

T he men sent representatives 
Rob Ewanio and Jon Wong in the 
shot put and 1,500 meters, respec-
tively. 

Ewanio, who broke his own 
school record twice this season, 

headed into San Angelo as the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association champion and was 
seeded second in the nation , just 
behind Taras Rohde of California 
State University, Los Angeles, 
who he defeated at the conference 
championships to defend his title. 

On May 23 , day one of compe-
tition, Wilson finished fourth in 
her heat with a time of 62 .72 in the 
400-meter low hurdles, but failed 
to qualify for the finals. Wilson was 
seeded 16th based on her 62.52 set 
at the Pomona-Pitzer Invitational 
on April 19. 

"She ran 62 .72 in a pretty strong 
wind - clearly the best race of her 
life," Sa lerno said. "She put it 
together. For her first time com-
peting at the meet, that's pretty 
exciting." 

Bergin, the 14th seeded throw-
er heading in , posted a throw of 
166 feet to finish eighth in the 
women 's hammer throw, scoring 
one point for the team total hot 
on the heels of her school -record 
166-11 at conference champi-
onships. Most importantly, Bergin 
achieved the All-America status 
she had been hoping for heading 
into the meet. 

Bergin's one point tied the 
women's team with Pennsylvania's 
Shippensburg University for 12th 
place at the end of the first day's 
co 11peti tion. 

"It's totally exciting and I feel 
great about it," Bergin said. "It was 
a really tight field, though - if you 
looked at the seedings, we were all 
two feet within each other, so I had 
a sense of confidence that really 

helped." 
On the men's side, Wong fin-

ished seventh in his heat with a 
time of 3:57 .5 8, but failed to 
advance to the finals after he 
qualified with a time of 3:52.22, 
se t at the Ben ny Brown 
Invitational at Cal State Fullerton 
on May 9. 

"He came in ranked 19th, so he 
would have really had to put 
something together," Sa lerno 
said. "It's a tactical race, so the 
time doesn't really reflect how 
well he ran." 

On the second day of.competi-
tion, Sung scored four points for 
the team as a result of her fifth-
place finish in the 3,000 meters 
with a mark of 10:10.68, an 
improvement over last year's sixth-
place finish in the same event. 
Sung, now a two-time All-
Ameri can in the 3,000 meters, 
headed into Friday'S competition as 
the sixth seed and the CCM run-
ner-up.

with a 2.15 ERA. He also notched 
six saves in his role as closer for the 
Tritons, which tied him for sec-
ond-most in the conference. 

Riddle, UCSD's sophomore 
designated hitter, was the sole 
Triton designated to the AlI-
CCAA first team. Riddle was an 
integral part of UCSD's explosive 
offense, since he led or was tied 
for most of the Tritons' major 
offensive categories, including 
hits, RBIs, doubles and home 
runs. 

Junior pitchers Cremidan and 
Sanders each earned All-CCAA 
second team honors to join Riddle 
in the ranks of the league elite. 
Cremidan anchored the starting 
pitching staff with a 7-2 record 
and 3.07 ERA, placing him fifth-
best in the CCAA.

All-CCAA honorable ention win-

the Tritons, while Smith commit-

in center field. Smith was also a 
two-time CCAA Player of the

sophomore Amy Mettee, who was 
selected to the NCAA Division II 
All-West Region first team and 
the Louisville Slugger/National 
Fastpi tch Coaches Association 
Division II All-America third team 
for third base. 

Mettee led the league with a 
.394 batting average and was the 
Tritons' unquestionable MVP 
offensively, leading UCSD in hits 
(78), runs (46), doubles (18), 
triples (96), home runs (5), slug-
ging percentage (.621) and stolen 
bases (15). Mettee was also select-
ed as CCAM Player of the Week 
twice during the regular season 
and was selected to the All-CCAA 
first team. 

Menee was joined in national 
honors by senior pitcher Leea 
Harlan. Harlan posted a 2.32 ERA 
this season en route to picking up 
12 wins. She holds the UCSD 
career record in wins, innings 
pitched and strikeouts. She earned 
nomination to the NCAA All-West 
Region second team, as well as All-
CCM second-team honors. 

Senior left fielder Kristina 
Anderson joined Harlan on the 
All-West Region second team and 
also received All-CCAA honorable 
mention honors after hitting .316 
and leading the Tritons this year 
with 35 RBIs. 

Other league award selections 
included the second half of the 
Tritons' senior pitching duo, 
Christi Martinelli, who threw her 
way to a 20-9 record with a 1.41 

ERA this year. Her 208 strikeouts 
were over 20 strikeouts more than 
the second-place pitcher in the 
league. Martinelli was named 
CCANs Pitcher of the Week twice.

CCAA first team honors after hit-
ting .296 this year and leading the 
league with nine hit-by-pitches.

letes and one male athlete selected 
by the College Sports Infonnation 
Directors of America to Veriwn 
Academic District awards.

ment major with a 3.39 GPA, was 
named to the Verizon Academic 
All-America College Division 
Softball District VITI Team for the 
second consecutive year. 

Joining Anderson with All-
District VIII College At-Large 
Team nominations were Lindsey 
Meeks, Lyndsey Tadlock and 
Samara Silverman. 

Meeks, a senior biochemistry 
major with a 3.701 GPA, was an 
All-American four years in a row 
for the UCSD women's swimming 
team, which finished fourth at this 
year's NCAA national champi-
onships.

nis team, which won the CCAA 
tide, finished ranked 13th in the 
nation and went to the NCAA 
national quarterfinals.

T here is nothing so great as a 
rivalry. 

For a sports fan , it is the reason 
to root and love your team. The 
victories are sweeter and the losses 
harder to take when the game is 
against a rival. Rivalries exist on all 
levels of the game. In high school, 
you blindly despise the crosstown 
school; in college you get Cal-
Stanford; and in the pros we rely 
upon histoty for our rivalries. 

In the United States, these pro-
fessional rivalries are created 
through acts like the Dodgers and 
Giants both moving to California, 
and the dichotomy between Yankee 
success and BoSox melancholy. 

But rarely, if ever, does a rivalry 
extend beyond our borders. It has 
never even made it to Alaska or 
Hawaii. The rivalry is pretty much 
a citizen of the Lower 48. 

Within these bounds, rivalries 
are tied up with other kinds of 
competitions, like state-to-state 
and city-to-city, so that when the 
teams play they are not just fighting 
for sporting glory, but for interstate 
bragging rights. 

What happens when a rivalry 
goes international? 

Can we as Americans even fath-
om an international sporting rival-
ry? What would it be like if the 
biggest game of the year for foot-
ball was the United States versus 
England and not a Super Bowl
