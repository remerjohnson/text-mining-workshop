Staff Writer 

A rally supporting thc Unitcd tatcs' 
reccnt miliciry efforts and featuring many 
leaders from the San Diego community was 
held Tuedsay at the Price Center Plaza. 

The event, sponsored by College 
Republicans at UCSD, Tbr ell/ifomill Rroiew 
and t he UCSD Conservative Union, 
addressed President thc decision to use mili -
tary action in Afghanistan in response [0 the 
Sept. II terrorist attacks. 

"We know how diverse America is," aid 
KOGO radio personality Roger Iledgccock. 
"Now it's time to find out how united we are. 
Today, we are here to rally arOlmd our grand 
old Rag, a symbol that has stood for freedom 
and 011porrunity throughout our history." 

While the latest Gallup Polls indicate 
dl.r Pres idem Bush's approval rating is at 89 
percent, and that 92 percent of Americans 
support the use of military action agaimt the 
Taliban regime, campus conservatives feel 
that many at UCSD have been reluctant 'to 
embrace Bu h's plan of action. 

" [gnorance and apathy: Both run rampant 
in our country, on the world stage and on our 
campus," said Brian Brook, co-chai rperson 
of the Unified Campus Coalition. "Ilow 
many more people have to die before we do 
something'" 

Several speakers said that taki ng a stand 
against the war was "un-American." 

James Keller, a captain in the U.S. Marine 
Corps, said that the United tates has fought 
for freedom on multi ple occasions.

expired and were removed from the system. 
During the following week, over 25 unsolicited e· 
mails were sent to students on the list.

Contributing Writer 

UCSD Chancellor Robert C. 
Dynes announced in a ca mpuswide 
e-mai l last week that the 
University of Californ ia has creat-
ed a universitywide holiday to 
commemorate Cesar Chavez. The

ing March 29, 2002. 

The decision followed Gov. Gray 
Davis' recognition of a statewide 

INSIDE ... 

holiday in memory of Chavez. 
• T his long-awaited state holiday 

recognizes the civil rights crusades 
of a remarkable citizen who strove 
fo r economic justice for the state's 
most vu lnerable employees," Davis 
stated. 

Chavez, who fought for farmers ' 
rights, led the first successful farm 
workers' union in U.S. history. 
Later he became the president of 
the United farm Workers of 
America, the AFL-C[O.

Rally: 
Speakers call for support 
for bombing campaign 
Continued from pace 1 
and disagreement," Keller sa id. 
"Now our generation is faced 
with a choice. Our country's free-
dom was nOt won overnight. It 
continues to be forged 225 years 
later." 

Al though only those in favor of 
forceful retaliation against the 
Taliban spoke at the rally, several 
anti-war onlookers were present 
Tuesday. Whi le they did not cause 
commotion or confrontation, they 
were certainly noted by event par-
ticipants. 

"The different points of view 
here today really depict the beauty 

of America," said Steve Vaus, a 
folk singer who performed 
"There's an Eagle," a song he 
composed in the wake of the ter-
rorist attacks. "We can both be in 
the same space and express our-
selves freely." 

Other speakers at the rally 
included Robert Forouzandeh and 
Vince Vasquez of the UCSD 
Conservative Union, California 
Assemblywoman Charlene Zettel 
and San Diego County Supervisor 
Bill Horn. 

Mark Aquino of UCSD Fleet 
Services performed "The Sta r 
Spangled Banner" to begin the 
event and "God Bless the U.S.A." 
during an intermission. He 
offered some insight on the ra lly'S 
purpose. 

"It hould be known that we as 
Americans stand for freedom, 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

from the local to the national 
level," Aquino said. "That is what 
we are trying to accomplish 
today." 

Hedgecock, who hosts a con-
servative radio show on KOGO 
600 AM weekday afternoons, 
broadcast li ve from the Price 
Center stage after the rally 
ended. 

During the program, 
Hedgecock fie lded questions and 
comments from the audience, who 
had mixed opinions on the matter 
at hand. 

"The most important point we 
want stressed is unity," said 
Vasquez, a Revelle senior and the 
UCSD Conservative Union's 
chai rman. "We are diverse within 
ourselves, but it is essential that 
we support the president'S deci-
sion in solidarity."

Flyers: 
Some resolve to remove 
themselves from list 
Continued from page 1 

Duplicate e-mai ls - four from 
the athletic department advertising 
the Chancellor!> 5K and games over 
the weekend, three from Alpha 
Kappa Delta Phi promoting Breast 
Cancer Awareness Month, two plug-
ging last weekend's Open House and 
two from the UCSD Bookstore 
announcing its upcoming events -
further agi tated recipients. 

"I think its unnecessary; its a nui-
sance," said Mui r senior Rob Parry. 
"I should unsubscribe myself." 

Other students, including Parry, 
were especially irked by an e-mail 
from a student who accidentally 
replied to the whole list when apol-
ogizing for not being able to make 
an event because he had tickets to 
Bob Dylan's recent show at 
RIMAC Arena. 

The student, who asked not be 
identified, said he regrets the error. 

Qllistorff said he hoped his e-mail 
would bring attention to this flaw in 
S.O.L.O.'s list server, which allows 
people to respond to the whole list. 

NEW 3 

Ellen Erenea of S.O.L.O. sent 
detai led instructions OCt. 19 telling 
students how to remove themselves 
from the account. It is unclear how 
many have bet!n removed from the 
Student Flyers list. 

Since Oct. 15 there have been 
five complaints about Student 
Flyers, aid S.O.L.O. Director 
Yolanda Leyva . Still, Lcyv<1 
acknowledged students' frustration . 

"We realize there are toO many 
different flyers going out," Leyva 
said. "We are concerned about it." 

S.O.L.O. is loolcing at other ways 
to disperse such information, such as 
a weekly calendar, Leyva said. 

Leyva also urged people with 
suggestions to contact her office. 

For some students, the messages 
help them stay informed about ca m-
pus activities and sort through U1C 
various events that go on every week, 
which is the goal of Snldent Flyers. 

"I don't mind [the e-mails] 
because [they] bring mc informa-
tion I may not have access to with-
out it in my e-mail," said Roosevet 
senior Stacy Berger. 

Both Rob and Jill plan to unsub-
cribc, but for Quistorff, the cru ade 
will go on: "lf someone i going to fill 
my mailbox with something I don't 
want, I will do the amc to u1eirs." 

Sam Scoulus/Cua,6on 

LoUing on: Students access inforrnauon using campus computers. Many students

Domestic partners 
bill levels slaying 
field for a couples 

On Oct. 14, Gov. Gray' Davis signed into 
law California Assembly Bill 25 . T he bill 
was one of hundreds given the OK just 
before the midnight deadline by which 
Davis had to Juthorize or veto bills passed 
by the state legislatu re this year. 

T he bi ll expands domestic partners' 
rights for same-sex couples, and for oppo-
site-sex couples in which at least one mem-
ber is over the age of 62 . Wi th the enact-
ment of this bi ll , California moves to the 
fo refront of the national debate over gay 
rights - and it is a well -chosen step. 

Indeed, such legislation is long overdue. 
We commend Davis for signing the contro-
versial bi ll despite protest by many groups. 

Under the new legislation, couples regis-
tered as domestic parmers gain new rights 
formerly only afforded to married couples. 
Among these, they will be able to admiI1lster 
each other's estates, inherit property from a 
deceased partner without a will, sue for 
wrongful death on behalf of a partner and 
adopt a partner's child using the step-parent 
adoption process. 

We welcome this legislation because it 
allows for treatment of committed gay cou-
ples in the same ways that married straight 
couples are. While this law does not legalize 
gay marriage - which is expressly prohibit-
ed under the Cali fo rnia ConstitutIOn - it 
dodges that thorny issue and still allows for 
the pragmatic benefits of parmership. 

The bill is also appreciated because it 
acknowledges that homosexuals are entitled 
to the same basic rights as heterosexuals and 
because it lega lly recognizes that their part-
nerships are as deserving as those of straight 
couples. 

Especia ll y promising is the provision that 
essentia lly permits partners to become step-
parents, which leg:itimizes the validity of ' 
nontraditional famIlies. 

Cri tics of AB 25 claim that it is in fact a 
gay marriage bill under a more palatable 
name, that the legislation condones purport-
edly immoral behavior and that the bill den-
igrates the institution of marriage. 

It is unfortunate that such bigotry is still 
present in California. To pass moral judg-
ment on the actions of others is one thing, 
but to expect the government to make legis-
lation based on these judgments is ridicu-
lous. 

Any law that gives equallrotection under 
the law to a disenfranchise group is benefi -
cial to us all. 

We can now only hope that legislation 
such as this wi ll become the rule and not the 
exception around the country, and that we as 
a nation will devote ourselves to ensuring 
the fair and equi table treatment of all our 
citi zens, thus reaffi rming the basic va lues 
that make United States a beacon of free-
dom around the world.

. Christianity misunderstood by 
detractors and faithful alike 

Assumptions fai~ to encompass true mess~g~,. ?f J ~sus 
By MATTHEW E. CROW 
Contributing Writer 

I n almost every discussion I have 
ever had about Christianity with some-
one who was non-Christi an or atheist, I 
have come away with the same level of 
shock at others' assumptions about my 
fai th - and about me - that are pre-
sented . 

As someone who describes himself 
as a C hristian, I am more often than 
not automatically a homophobic , igno-
rant, unthinking individual in others' 
eyes; one who refuses to see anything 
other than what the churdl tells me to 
see. 

Such responses disturb me for many 
different reasons. Primarily, I am dis-
turbed because this phenomenon 
reflects not oilly the misunderstanding 
of J esus' message by people with differ-
ent perspectives on religion. More so, 
it re fl ec ts the misunderstanding of 
many C hristians concerning J esus of 
Naza reth. 

T he source of such probl ems is 
obvious. Christiani ry as a whole i the 
inh erito r of a long history of in justice 
- a trad ition in which it takes part 
even today. I ca nnot blame many peo-
ple fo r mistrusting Christian ity when, 
in most of its deno minations, women 
are not allowed to be priests o r minis-
ters, J esus is hail ed as a man whe will 
bri ng eternal flam e upon the wi cked 
and homosexuals are banned fro m par-
ticipa ting in any signifi cant manner. 

Let me go on th e record as stati ng 
that such prac tices are a far cry from 
the ones that J esus attempted to insti ll 
in his followers at the beginn ing of the 
"common era," 2,000 years ago. To 
understand Jesus and his goal for 
humanity, we must return to his time 
and examine the words he spoke and 
the pun ish ment he received for those 
words. 

At t)1e beginning of the fir t century, 
the Roman Empire stood on the brink 
of its "Pax Romana," the period in 
which it enjoyed widespread peace and 
prosperity. Romc had spread its power 
throughout Europe, the Middle East 
and northern Africa . 

The J udeans were one of the many 

peoples who had become subjects of 
Augustus Caesar against ·their will , and 
they lived an impoverished life in what 
was then called Palestine. J udean high 
priests enjoyed sicleening wealth as 
puppets of the imperial 
government, while most J udeans 
scraped out a meager existence in the 
city of Jerusalem or in the desert. 
Women shared their social status with 
cattle, children were abused, the sick 

. were outcast from society as sinners in 
the eyes of the Judean God and the 
poor were labeled as less than fully 
human. 

I cannot blame many 
people for mistrusting 

Christianity when, in most 
of its denominations, 

women are not allowed to 
be priests or ministers, 

Jesus is hailed as a man 
who will bring eternal 

flame upon the wicked and 
homosexuals are banned 
from partiCipating in any 

significant manner. 

Radi cal Jud ean religi ous leaders said 
th at G od was going to send them a 
messiah to lead them out of oppres-
si on . Militant Judean freedom fi ghters 
called Zea lots awaited the coming o f 
this warrior prophet and tr ied to 
inspire rebellion aga inst Rome. Many 
of these fi ghters' were subjected to the 
Roman practice of crucifixion in public 
places in towns throughout Palestine. 

Accordi ng to the New Tes tament of 
the Bi ble, God heard the cries of the 
Judea ns and sent them Jesus. ' 

It is difficu lt for us to comprehend 
the amazement with which people must 
have reacted to hear that the poor son 
of a carpenter was to be their libera-
tor. Peopl e wanted a gia nt li ke Moses 
and. as Christians believe, they got a 
pacifist young man who spent his ti me 

eating and socializing with prosti tutes , 
tax collectors, the infec ted, the wound-
ed, the poor and the downtrodden . 

Jesus managed to fit all this in while 
building a career on publicly condemn-
ing the Judean and Roman establi sh-
ments of social class and conservative 
religious doctrine. He also proclaimed 
himself to be the Son of God. This did 
not go over well with the authoriti es. 

Herein lies the paradox' of modern 
Christianity. The leadership of the 
Catholic and Protestant churches seek 
to make Christianity a reactionary 
institution that excludes certain group6 
of people and silences other views, 
much like the institution Jesus sought 
to reject 2,000 years ago. 

Jesus sought to build a world where 
all were included and valued equally as 
individuals. 

Jesus said that those who were first 
on Earth would be last in heaven, and 
vice versa. He said that people with ter-
minal illnesses and the poor were the 
beloved ones of God, not the corpulent 
priests of the high temples inJerusakm 
or the pagan rulers of Rome. He ate at 
the same table as those who were 
labeled heretics because he knew that 
they were not. He conversed with lep-
ers when no one else would , and upheld 
S.amaritans, members of an isolated 
northern sect of Judai sm, and just as 
loved in God's eyes as the Judeans. 

He spoke of forgiveness and love 
when religious authorities spoke of 
pun ishment and banishment, th ings 
that are often invoked, tragica lly and 
ironicall y, in the name 6f J esus by those 
who would ca ll themselves C hristia ns. 
For exampl e, the Rev. J erry Falwell 
professes a belief that AIDS is a resul t 
of q od's wrath at socie ty'S inclusio n of 
homosexuals. This is a man wh o has 
grossly misunderstood the message of 
his Lord . 

For all of the troubl e J esus dedicat-
ed himself to raising, he was sentenced 
to die on th e cross. H e died somewhere 
around A. D . 33 as best we can tell front 
bibl ical and Roman sourccs. 

However, from the littl e-no ticed 
death of one man arose the most influen-

rhere is no free I'unch, even in college 
Paying for school oneself demonstrates independence 

I 'm no scientisth but recent events ave 
led me to conclude 
that men and women 
are of completely dif-
ferent species. 

Now, because I am someone 
who thought the term "homo sapi-
ens" was a dirty joke until the age of 
12, you may thinle that I am highly 
unqualified to make this kind of 
claim. And it's true - I have 
absolutely no business talking about 
the incredibly precise and incredi-
bly boring categorization of organ-
isms. But is that going to stop me 
from talking about it anyway? Hell 
no. 

Saturday night found me at a 
San Diego State party with myoid 
friend. Let's call him Warren (that's . 
not his real name). Obviously, as a 
journal~m nerd and all -around life-
less reject, I had no business what-
soever being at such a gathering. 
Yet there J was, not even attempting 
to look cool, because really - what 
would be the point? 

About an hour and clearly sever-
al drinks la ter, Warren (no, really, 
that 1S7l '/ his name') approached me 
and began (to my still -vivid horror) 
to confess the fact that he had 
something of a crush on me. 

1 won't re-enact the conversa-
tion for you, but suffice it to say that 
Warren sounded lilee an idiot, and I 
sounded very confused. 

But this is not why I have deter-
mined that men and women cannot 
possibly be members of the same 
species. What happened later that 
night was what cinched it 

Around 1:30 a.m., I decided that 
we were ready to go. I based this 
decision on the fact that I was tired 
(I told you I was a nerd) and that 
Warren (would you please stop 
thinlcing that is his real name?) was 
falling-all -over-himself-and-others 
drunk. 

I walked up to my friend, 
grabbed his arm to get his attention 
(and to keep him from falling on 
me), and said. "Warren, even

My dad is a great guy. He's one 
of those people who knows every-
thing - really. I t'S ~nd of spooky. 
And he's a great dad, too: In 18 
years. we've only had one fight. 
But, oh what a fight it was. 

It was about a month before I 
left for college. He was driving me 
home from worle and he said, 
"Jess. there's something I want to 
talle to you about." Before I knew 
it, we'd gotten ourselves into a 
heated argument over who was 
going to pay for my next four years 
of school. 

I suppose that arguments with 
such premises are pretty common 
between recent high school gradu-
ates and their parents during that 
time of year. But somehow, I doubt 
that this one fell into the conven-
tional parameters of those argu-
ments. 

Since middle school, I have 
known that I would pay for col-
.lege. While most kids were still 
getti ng allowances, I had a job -
in middle school , mind you, which 
is actually legal if the job adheres 
to certain rules about hours and 
wages - a monthly budget and a 
mutual funds account. 

I worleed anywhere between 
one and three jobs in high school. 
During my junior and senior years 
I held two jobs, working about 35 
hours per week. During the sum-
mers, it was more like 50 hours. 

So there I was, ready to head 
off to school with two years of

tuition, room and board ready and 
waiting in my account. And it felt 
so good. 

Occasionally, when I tell people 
about this endeavor, they'll look at 
me with a vague appearance of dis-
belief and ask, "Gee, how did you 
manage that?" 

When people ask me tkings 
like that, it's hard not to be defen-
sive. It's hard 

placement classes, editor in chief 
of two school newspapers and, oh 
yes, a grade point average of 3.8, 
unweighted. 

When my dad told me he want-
ed to pay for school, I should have 
been thrilled. It should have meant 
that I had financial security ahead 
of me, that I wouldn't have to work 
in college, that I could enjoy the 

next four years 
not to feel 
like I have a 
$16,000 chip 
on my shoul-
der. 

I do my 
best to 
understand 
that for some 
people, that 
kind of com-
mitment is 
unrealistic . 
Many people 
have a lot of 
legitimate 
obligations to 
things such as 
aca d e mi cs, 
athletics and 
extracurricu-
lar activities. 

When my dad told me 
he wanted to pay for 
school, I should have 

been thrilled. It should 
have meant that I had 

financial security 

of my life with-
out worrying 
about the per-
formance of my 
stock portfolio. 

In reality, it 
was probably 
the cruelest 
thing my par-
ents have ever 
done. Paying 
for college was 
a burden 1 had 
already accept-
ed . It was 
something that 
I had already 
worked for. It's 
something that 
took many sac-
rifices. It was 

ahead of me, that I 
wouldn't have to work 
in college, that I could 

enjoy the next four 
years of my life 

without worrying about 
the performance of my 

stock portfolio. 

I'm rea lly not interested in any 
sort of one-upmanship about who 
did more in high school because 
it's not about that. All I know is 
that if something is important to 
you, you'll find the time to make it 
work. Let's just say that maybe 
because it was so important to me, 
I managed just fine - 35 hours of 
work per week, three advanced 

lower of Christ could be executed. 
Many people today, it seems, 

forget the past too 
easily. Christianity is a radical 
religion that has inspired people 
to do both gloriously wonderful 
and hOrribly ugly things for the 
world. Christians today forget 
what they are called to do: They 
are called to love all people and 
to be willing to die for the belief 
that God loves all people too. 

Today, we live in a world 
where such idealistic goals seem 
to be distant dreams. Catholic 
presbyters tell their congrega-

the main facto r 
in my choice of college. Hell , I 
turned down an Ivy League 
school to come here because 
UCSD had a price tag that I 
could afford. And suddenly came 
the news, "None of that matters 
now, because it's not your respon-
sibility after all ." 

It is so important to me that I 
take responsibility for my educa-

tions that only Roman Catholics 
can truly be saved. At the funer-
als of homosexuals, fundamental-
ist ministers hold up signs that 
read "God hates fags ." 

All people who claim to be 
followers of Jesus should under-
stand that such behavior is so far 

. removed from the message of 
Jesus as to be laughable. 

Quite simply, to be a 
Christian, one must understand 
the truth of only a few basic 
ideas : first, that God loves all 
people regardless of color, gen-
der or creed ; second, that God 

tion. So Illany people say that what 
they like best about college is the 
freedom, the independence. For 
me, it's not freedom if someone 
else is paying for it. It 's Illy educa-
tion, my life , my four years. 

I've never understood how my 
peers can just let people pay for col-
lege for them. It sounds rather con-
descending, 1 know. And I suppose 
that just because something is 
important to me doesn't mean that 
other people should instantly foll ow 
suit. If other people can just accept 
someone else putting them through 
school , that 's cool, but I can't. 

My parents put themsel ves 
through school. T hey didn 't have a 
choice. They say that being able to 
support me financiall y means a lot 
to them, and they understand that 
financial independence is impor-
tant to me because it was impor-
tant to them too. 

Eventually my dad and I came 
to an agreement - after all , he 's a 
great guy. We decided that I'd pay 
for whatever I could, and my par-
ents would take care of any debts 1 
had incurred at the end of four 
years. And though it boggles the 
mind to consider the non-educa-
tion-related misdeeds that such an 
agreement could lead to, I imagine 
that nothing too outrageous will 
show up on my parents' bi ll after 
four years. 

The second week of th is quar-
ter, I went off to get a job. I knew 
that I'd need one in order to make 
this whole independence thing 
work. I'm working about 25 hours 
a week, and I'm loving it. 

sent Jesus to die on the cross to 
save humanity from the si n of 
not loving all people; and finall y, 
that the spirit of Jesus was resur-
rected and lives on in our daily 
actions. 

Anyone who tells you other-
wise is quite simply wrong, 
and those who would seek to use 
their faith to exclude others and 
to harm others are seriously per-
verting the message of th eir 
beloved leader. 

This, I must end in sayi ng, is 
true for all of G od's re ligions on 
Earth .

WE'RE LOOKING FOR 1WINS FOR A snJDY AT UCSD! 

UCSD researchers would like to meet people who are twins for a brief 
study on how heredity influences blood pressure in healthy persons. Because 
twins share genes, twin pairs allow us to evaluate readily how heritability 
influences traits. We see both identical ("monozygotic') and fratemal 
("dizygotic') twin pairs. We seek twins of either sex, 18 years of age or 
older, and all ethnic groups or races. 

The study takes about 40 minutes and includes measurement of blood 
pressure and heart rate, as well as taking blood and urine sample. We will 
provide monetary compensation for your time and travel. 

If you and your twin would like to find out more aboui this study, please 
contact Lily Roo at: (858) 552-8585, extension 6158; fax: (858) 641-6331 ;

The article by Matthew Lepori 

agairist general education require-
ments ("Out with the old rules, in 
with the new," Oct. 22) actually 
helps to demonstrate the need for 
such requirements. 

Lepori wonders how learning 
other subjects will make him a bet-

let's go." OK, actually I just said, 
" Hey, let's go." 

Now, 1 want everyone to say that 
out loud, infusing it with as little 
inflection and feeling as possible. 
"Hey, let's go." That's what I said. 

Warren immediately interpreted 
that as a pick-up line. 

Believe me, there was no come 
hither look, no unnecessary body 
contact, nothing to indicate that 
"Hey, let's go" should be taken to 
mean, "Hey, I want to take you 
home and screw your brains out." 

Yet Warren's response was a very 
sl urred version of "I knew you liked 
me too," while he appeared to try to 
hug me and lick his own ear at the 
same time. 

I would like to assure you that in 
no way did I interpret this as a com-
pliment or an indicator of any sex 
appeal I may possess (trust me, I 
don't have any) . Even journalism 
nerds start looking good after 
enough alcohol. 

This is my point: Members 9f a 
common species are often identified 
by a common language, and clearly 
men and women speak languages 
about as different as Japanese and 
the sound of a V-6 engine. 

No woman would ever think 
that having a designated driver 

ter writer. If UCSD were a techni-
cal school, such as ITT Tech or one 
of the many others advertised on 
daytime television to jobless peo-
ple, this would be a valid question. 

However, UCSD is a university 
and has a responsibility to educate its 
students. lbis educational responsi-
bility is not limited to technical 
excellence in one field. It includes a 
broad education in a variety of sub-
jects designed to expand the intellec-
tual caracities of students. Students 
with a university degree should be 
expected to have these abilities and 
to be able to think intelligendy about 
a variety of subjects. 

If students do not want this kind 
of education, I suggest they drop 
out of UCSD immediately and 
enroll in one of the many technical 
schools available. Some of them 
actually allow one to fulfill all 
requirements by mail. Just think: In 
six shon weeks, you can be an 
expert in shoe repair or lock-
smithing. No general education 
requirements at all . 

On the other hand, if you want 
a degree from a quality institution, 
you will be expected to take cours-
es that will make you well-rounded. 

The question "Does knowing 
how the coastal currents of 
California work make me a better 
person?" seems to be a reference to 
Earth Sciences 30, a course I am 
currendy enrolled in. In fact, those 
paying attention in this course 

approach her to say "Hey, let's go" 
could be a come-on. For better or 
worse, only a man would ever thinJc 
that. 

And you can't blame the alcohol 
either, because men always think 
that women are confessing their 
nonexistent attraction to them 
through general expressions. 

When I was a freshman in high 
school, I became reacquainted with 
a friend whom I had not seen since 
preschool. The fact that Emily 

• actually recognized me was freaky 
by itself, but not nearly as much as 
what happened two days later. 

We had the same French class. 
In that class was also a guy who 
went to preschool with us and 
whose mother is very good friends 
with mine. And for some reason, 
Emily (who I think may be super-
human) recognized jason, too. 

I was there for the conversation. 
Ibis is exacdy what happened: 

Emily (giddy with happiness 
upon having recognized another 
former playmate, thus being able to 
show off her memoty superpowers): 
Jason? Oh my gosh, it's me, Emily! 

Jason (clearly confused but no 
less eloquent): What? 

Emily (annoyed that she is not as 
recognizable as she had thought): 
We went to preschool together! 

Jason (either recognizing her, or 
just feeling stupid and playing 
along): Holy shit, you're right. Hey. 

At this point we had to go to 
class, so we went our separate ways. 

When I got home, my mother 

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 25, 200l 

(about SO percent of the students 
- the remainder ulk all period) 
are learning about a variety of sub-
jects that will allow them to make 
more informed decisions on envi-
ronmental issues. The rest will be 
easy prey for demagogues on the 
right and the left who rely upon the 
public's lack of knowledge to push 
their agendas on these issues. 

One of the reasons the universi -
ty is striving to offer a quality edu-
cation is to make its graduates bet-
ter citizens of our democracy. This 
is one of the most important jobs of 
every American citizen - more 
important, I woulO argue, than 
learning technical skills that are 
valuable in the job'market. 

The fact that students are reuin-
ing little information from these 
classes is not the fault of the univer-
sity but is the fault of a student body 
whose mantra seems to be "Cram, 
regurgitate, forget. Repeat until 
degree is conferred." Ibis is an 
insult to professors, teaching assis-
tants, administrators, students who 
actually learn the material and to the 
educational institution itself. 

To sum up, if you don't want to 
learn, leave. There are plenty of 
people to take your place who 
lnight actually want to get a real 
education. 

- Brinn Belyea 
GradUlltt student 

UMber Education Program 

informed me that jason's mom had 
told her that Jason came home, 
convinced that Emily would be his 
girlfriend before the end of the 
week. Apparendy, when she said 
"hello" to him, jason understood 
that to mean, "Take me now, you 
sex machine." Why? Because men 
and women simply do not share a 
common language. 

By the way, those were their real 
names. I just didn't feel like making 
up new ones. I still maintain that 
.Warren is an alias, though . 

To bridge the language gap 
somewhat, I will now offer the 
humble beginnings of a language 
translator for men. 

"Hello" and all its derivatives: 
This is a form of greeting or 
acknowledgment, not to be mistak-
en with "I want to fuck you." 

"How are you?": indication of 
concern over emotional and/or 
physical state of being. Not synony-
mous with "How would you like to 
fuck me?" 

"Do we have homework?": 
quantitative question, not referring 
to "Do we have time for sex, or do 
we have too much homework?" 

"Wow, it's been rea lly hot lately," 
or other such weather-related com-
ments: Tbis means we want sex. 
Duh. 

So basically, men everywhere 
should buy my translator when I 
complete it. Until then I'm staying 
home, where thCl'e are no drunk 
people to assault me, unless you 
count my roommate.

SYRACUSE, N .Y. - When 
Carol Davison was a student at 
Syracuse University in the early 
t 940s, she lived in a sorority 
house, went to parties and con-
certs and dated plenty of boys. 

But Davison, now 74, said her 
sorority imposed a strict lnidnight 
curfew. Fraternity partie were 
di'gnified eventS, and dating a boy 
meant he picked her up at the 
door and paid for her evening out 
on the town. 

While those times may have 
been more conservative, social 
standards meant Davison could 
date several boys at the same time 
without appearing immoral. 

D~vi~on's granddaughter, Liz 
B1azey, a sophomore at SU, is 
experiencing a very different col-
lege love life than her grandmoth-
er's. She has dated the same guy 
since her senior year in high 
school. ow the two are enrolled

While Blazey is happy in her 
relationship, she admitted that the 
situation is anything but perfect. 

"I miss out on a lot of dating 
and just meeting people," she said. 
"r'm not looking for guys, and 
sometimes that doesn't seem nor-
mal at the age that I am." 

B1azey said many of her friends 
do go out to find guys. 

"They go out just to hook up 
with people," she said. "It's just 
not what I'm looking for." 

Many SU students observed 
that most of their peers are either 
involved in a committed relation-
ship, or just go out to meet some-
one for a one night stand. The 
days of the formal-yet-casual dat-
ing of Davison's generation are 
long gone. At the same time, SU 
studentS as a whole are not exacdy 
following in their parents ' free-

loving Birkenstocks either. 
Davison said ' that her college 

dating experiences were fun and 
lighthearted. 

She and her fri ends met boys in 
their classes and fixed one another 
up. Fraternity boys ofren came to 
Davison's house and asked the 
girls out. 

People socialized in big groups 
on weekends, but everyone always 
went with a date, she said. 

If a boy were to take a girl out, 
Davison said, he had to pick her 
up at the door. Destinations often 
included Glenn Miller concerts or 
dances at fraternity houses. The 
boy footed the bill. 

While alcohol and drugs were 
around, they were a small part of 
the social scene, Davison said. 
The birth control pill had not 
been invented yet, so sex was not a 
major consideration for Davison.

MISSOULA, Mont. 
Kristofor Stonesifer came to the 
University of Montana in August 
1999 because he loved the outdoors, 
but he joined UM's Army ROTC 
program because it was in his blood. 

His grandfather was in the 
Navy, his father is a retired avy 
captain, and his brother is an Army 
chief warrant officer. Stonesifer 
once spent two weeks living in a 
snow cave, eating squirrels and sur-
viving off the land - just to see if 
he could do it. 

Stonesifer realized his dream of 
becOining an Army Ranger soon 
after he left UM in May 2000, but 
his dream was cut short. 

Stonesifer, 28, died in Pakistan 
on Oct. 19 when the Black Hawk 
helicopter he was in crashed due to 
poor visibility. The helicopter may 
have been preparing to fly into 
Afghanistan to rescue g round 
troops. 

The crash killed Stonesifer, of

Dating: 
Current students have 
much more freedom 
Continued from page 7 

"My mother didn't tell me not 
to do anything, because she just 
,I sumed I wouldn 't," Da'~son said. 

T here were fewer fa ctors 
involved in the dating scene for 
Davison than for her granddaugh-
te r. 

"Life was lim," she sa id. "It was 
much less compl icated then." 

l ed Miller, a 73-yea r-old for-
mer professor at SU, has similar 
memories of his social life during 
his years at Cornell University. 
He and his fraternity brothers 
would throw parties and invite 
dates, go on trips to New York 
City and play bridge with girl-
friends. He had a lot of fun, he 
said, but times were much more 
innocent. 

"A girl in a sorority house 
couldn't sit on your lap without a 
magazine on your legs," Miller 
said. However, he did not limit 
himself to a single gi rlfriend for 
most of his college days. 

"I was in love with a different 
woman every week," he added. 

The sexual revolution of the 
1960s moved the acceptance of 
multiple sexual parmers increasing-
ly into the mainstream. 

Liz Cavallaro, a 54-year-old 
Baldwinsville resident, aid mem-
bers of her social circle in the 
1960s did not behave irrationally. 

"In the 19605, a date was 'Let's 
go protest,'" she said. "You went to 
a protest with a group of people. 
Usually you had one or two rea lly 
good friends in the group. At the 
end of the night, you'd go home 
with one or the other." 

Elisabeth Lasch-Q uinn, a histo-
ry professor who specializes in 20th 
century American social and cul-
tural history, agreed that the 19605 
was a time of open relationships 
and promiscui ty. 

"That time period brought a 
lot of. change in American life," 
she said. "Some of it was very good 
and some of it was bad." 

Lasch-Quinn poiQted our that 
the conservative natures of dating 
and married Ii fe prior to the 1960s 
left people - particularly women -
frustrated and repressed. So when 
social changes and the invention of 
the birth control pill came about in 
the 1960s, dating standards relaxed 
completely, she said. 

"The 1960s and '70s introduced 
the concept of the one-night stand as 
a way of life," Lasch-QuirUl said. "It 
was almost mainstream." 

Free love, however, came with 
a price, she added. Marriages

Diamond said. 

"He loves Montana. He loved 
the great Western sky," Diamond 
said, her voice cracking. "He was a 
real mountain man." 

After attending the University 
o f Del aware for two years, 
Stonesifer moved to Missoula in 
August 1999 with his girlfriend, 
Erin Lorch, and his best fri end, 
Luke Stevens, Diamond said. 
Stevens, who still lives in Missoula , 
new to Pennsylvania on Oct. 22 to 
be with Stones ifer 's parents, 
Diamond said . 

At VM, Stonesifer was one of 
the top two ROTC cadet , said Lt. 
Col. James Clegg, chair of the mil -
itary sc ience department and head 
of the ROTC at UM . 

Clegg reflccted on his formcr 
cadet with pride.

push-ups of anybody in the pro-
gram. He was that strong," Clegg 
said. "He was an extremely focused 
young person."

started failing and people were 
emotionally affected . 

"People were so hurt that we 
are still feeling the ramificatiom ," 
she said. 

While engaging in everal sexu-
al relationships at once Ill ay no 
longer be as pre,'a lent u. It wa .. 25 
years ago, coll ege studcnts roday 
arc still prone to baving emoti on-
less sexual re lationshi ps. 

Dave Burmaster, a senior polit-
ical science and po li cy tudies 
major, sa id he would not mi nd 
having a purely phys ica l relation-
ship. fIe said he rarely goes out on 
formal dates and docs not know 
many people who do. 

"It's more like, 'I'm hav ing a 
party, come by,' or 'I'll sec you at 
the bars,''' Burmaster said . "The 
environment of college encourages 
hooking up. You meet so many 
people and go our so much -
Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, 
Saturday nights." 

Not all SU students like the 
ambiguity of the dating scene. 
Katy O'Brien, a junior media 
major, said she knows few people 
who go out on actual dates, unless 
it's with someone they arc already 
seeing seriously. 

O'Brien said she wouldn't mind 
returning to some of the more for-
mal aspects of dating from earlier 
generations. She said it would be 
nice to just date people without 
having to commit to them, yet still 
avoid the pitfalls of a purely physi-
cal encounter. 

"I think that way the wh~e 
hook- u p- then -feel-stran ge-the -
next-day thing could be avoided," 
she said. "You could actually get to 
know them." 

Carol Davison agreed that 
casually seeing a few people on a 
mutually respectful level could be 
good for college students like 
O'Brien and Blazey. 

"It's good to taste what different 
people are like," Davison said . 
"The more people you get to know, 
the more you know what you want 
when you are ready to settle down." 

• Lasch-Quinn said that the open 
dating ritua ls of past generations 
have left dating today in nux. 
There is no set standard for meet-
ing and pursui ng people romami-
cally, and marriages may be failing 
as a result. 

People are left to blindly make 
their own way through ma ting rit-
uals, she said. -

No matter what, Lasch-Quinn 
pointed Out, the most imJlortam 
factor in a successful relationship 
is choice of partner. 

"Dating," she said, "is one of the 
most important things that we do."

Stonesifer was also a good stu-
dent who could be categori zed as 
an intellecnlal, Clegg sa id. 

"H e was a great reader; he 
would pick up a book and finish it, 
then pick up another book," Clegg 
said. Stonesifer majored in philoso-
phy "ith a 3.5 grade point average. 

"He grasped things very quick-
ly," C legg said. "He became skilled 
in a very short order." 

Stonesifer left UM one semester 
shy of graduation to try out for the 
Army Rangers, where he was one of 
20 selected from a pool or 23 0, 
Diamond said. 

"They're the best equipped, the 
best trained and thc most lethal ele-
ments in the United States Army," 
Clegg said of the Rangers. "lle 
wanted to be that best soldier and 
he kncw the only way to do th<1t 
was to get in a Ranger battalion." 

Clegg and Stonesifer sat down 
one day and di cussed Stonesifer's 
craving to become a ranger, Clegg 
said. Clegg advised Stone i fer not 
to leave UM, but admired his per-
sistence. 

"There was a time he was recon-
sidering his decision ... but it didn 't 
last long," Clegg said.

ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT 

OBER 25, 2001 

- his year 's installment of the 

I long-running Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted 
Festival of Animation held a grea t 
sclecoon of new and charming films, 
along with some "classics" and a cou-
ple of easi/.y forgettable pieces. 

Amusing and coarse, the festival 
promotes irseJf as a collection of the 
nastier side of animation. In truth, 
the 18-and-over age requirement 
seclns a bit overrated. Nothing is as 
offensive as you might expect. Most 
of the shorts are suitable for network 
broadcast. Granted, there are some 
"adult" themes: drugs, drinking, sui-
cide, tnIsogyny and sex; but come on, 
like you've never seen this kind of 
thing before. 

The origins of the festival go back 
more than 24 years, before the "clas-
sic" animation festival got started. 
Spike was living in Riverside, Calif., 
"the cultural end of the Ear th," as he 
pllt it, where he was the bassist and 
vocalist for a '50s parody greaser 
band. 

"We would play old canoons 
before and in between the sets," 

pike recounted. "You know, old 
'Popeye,' 'Betty-Boop,' 'Superman,' 
that kind of thing." 

Out of sheer desperation for 
something to do in Riverside Spike 
bcg-Jn playing cartoons in the party 
house known as "The Manor." 

"It. was a pretty wild place," Spike 
said. "It was three levels, and we 
threw crazy parties, like in Animal 
House.'" 

It was at one of these parties that 
Spike first met Mike, the now -
deceased half of Spike and Mike. 

"I-Ie showed up to a party uninvit-
ed in a clown costume," Spike said. 
"He had mirrors on his shoes, and 
was using them to look up women's 
dresses. -rneir boyfrienils beat Mike 
up and threw him Ollt of the party." 

eedless to say, Mike eventually 
moved into the The Manor's attic, 
and the two became fast friends. As a 
twosome, pike and Mike were able 
to compensate for each other's tal -
ents: "Mike was a great MC, and I 

wasn't," Spike remembers. "I-Ie wa 
always good at things I wasn't, and I 
was good at things he wasn't. " 

A Festi va l of Animation began 
slowly. 

"At first we just scrapped things 
together," Spike said. "It was very 
crude." 

Soon they found a source for sev-
eral films ill the National Film Board 
of Canada. As time went on, a repu-
tation began to build, and people 
began to send in films, bur this did 
not happen overnight. Spike has 
traveled the world to find new and 
interesting shorts. He was on the 
road for 10 months of the year in ear-
lier days, though now he spends 
more like four. 

"The show is definitely fun .... 
Spike said, "but it's a lot of work, and 
a lot of commitment." 

Spike and Mike's has approxi-
mately 50-city run throughout the 
year, allowing for ,vide exposure for 
the festival and the animation. All 
that time and effort are really begin-
ning to payoff. 

"We got mentioned this year on 
'The impsons,''' Spike said. "And 
we went on tour with Korn; it 
became titled the 'Sick and 1\visted' 
tour," 

Many now-famous and infamous 
cartoons have passed through the 
ranks of Spike and Mike, from 
"Wallice and Gromit" to "Beavis and 
BUMend" and even the "Powerpuff 
Girls." 

Watching this rise in the popular-
ity of cartoons that have been helped 
along by the festival has been bitter-
sweet for Spike. 

"in the beginning we really got 
screwed on the legal issue," he 

. recounted, "so we've never gotten 
any money or even any recognition 
when people usc the shorts." 

Still, Spike remains optimistic. 
"It's coming back to us," he said 

coyly. "It's getting bigger, and more 
and more people are hearing about 
US now."

By DAVID BYNUM 
Contributing Writer 

M idtcrms arc nearl y over, and with their compl etion come the wn -gratul ati on of the A.S. Counctl . 
This Friday, all card-carrying CSD 
studcnts are invited to celebrate III typ-
ical l i'i ton fashion: by gomg to see 
bands that we vaguely remember from 
juni or high in concert . D on 't com))l.lIn

T he sa me event that brought group~ 
such as Crash Test Dummies and SJ ' e 
Ferri s last yca r brtngs Young " I.e., Tlu 
Liks (formcrly known as the Al kohollt:.) 
and Voice of Reason to the Price Center 
Plaza Friday at 7 p.m. 

Nowatb ys the words "bust a IIllJ\ C" 
probably remind the majority of our 
reade rs of the h it eo-Geo video g;llm:, 
but not toO long ago Young ,\ I.e. ~ .1t 
atop the hip-hop Billboard cham for .1 
good long whtle with th l> dance Illl\ 
favori te. 

We've all heard "Bust a Move" and 
we 've all busted a move to It. 
U nfortunately, Young M.C.'s career diS-
appeared along with hiS genre of fTie ndl y 
rap with the introduction of ga ngsta' r.lp 
in tile early 1990s. 

Don't doubt Young's talent, howev-
er. He coautho red other grea t hits from 
the late 1980s such as Tone Loc's "Wi ld 
Thang" and " Funky Cold Medina," a 
favorite of everyone who knows what a 
medina is. 

He released a greates t hits album in 
1998 and is still touring and doi ng small 
shows. Young M .e. shows considerabl e 
commitment to his hip-hop ca reer, con-
sidering he has a University of Southern 
California economics degree. 

One wonders what UCSD coul d 
possibly be paying him thut he couldn 't 
be making a t most desk jobs. The 
answer: not much. Young M .e. ha ~ been 
keepin ' it rea l since before that phr.lsc 
was coined . 

Tha Liks bring a newer twist on hip-
hop culntrc to the lineup. T heir \.veh "te 
describes thei r music as " the navor .1I1d 
aroma of an extraordi nary cognac cou-
pled with the draw from a fi ne Cuban 
cigar." 

Said less fruitfully, they combine the 
worlds of hard hi p-hop and alternati ve 
music and arc well -respected by tho~c 
who participate in the hip-ho p ·suhcul-

THUR DAY, OCTOBER 25, 2001 THE UCSD ~UARDIAN HIATU II 

'Les Mis' rouses the house 
Strong cast and melodious score carry the musical 
By CHARLIE TRAN 
Hiatus Editor 

I t has ~ )een 21 yea rs since the first per-formAnce of "Les Miserables" in Paris, so naturally, a question arises: 
Can a touring production of an old musi-
ca l still invoke emotions as it did on open-
ing day? H there was a "master of the 
house," it would be "Les Mis." 

Set against the backdrop of the French 
Revolution, "Les Miserables" is the epic 
story of Jean Valjean (Randal Keith), who 
is imprisoned 19 years for stealing a loaf of 

e l---_....::....::..Th:....:....:ea.::....:...te:....:....:r Iii!!E1 REVIEW 
bread. Upon parole, he eludes Javert 
(Robert Mammana), a brutal and cold offi-
cer of the law, and starts a new life of 
honor to give back to society as rhe mayor 
ofa town. 

In tni s lown, a single mother, fantine 
Uoal1 Almedilla), is dismissed from her Job 
am! forced into prostitution, which gets 
her in trouble with the law. Valjcan 
prOlilises to take care of Fantine's ch ild , 
Cosette.

(Edward J uvier), who happens to be the 
object or affection for Eponine (Diana 
Kaarina) , a peasant living on the streets of 
Paris. 

Valjean has to deal not only with 
Cosette, but also with confrontations from 
the revolution and eluding capture from 
J avert. 

Sound confusing and complex' So arc 
daytime soap operas. But unlike tho,c TV 
, how" from "Lcs MIS" you'll get not only 

• 

superb acting but also an intelligenr plot 
that fl ow smoothly, and music that elo-
quently and captivatingly guides the audi-
ence. 

What defines "Les Mis" is the music. 
The score appeals to all; from its comic 
relief to soliloquies to ensemble cheers, 
the music is the soul and driving force of 
this production. Not only is the music as 
addictive as crack, it 's funny, sad, thrilling, 
inspiring and brilliant. 

The music is so enthralling that it real -
ly doesn't matter who's singing - it's just 
a matter of who does the better job. 

Kaarina does a marvelous job as 
Eponine when si nging "On My Own" to 
portray a fragile voice in the midst of 
chaos. J uvier also does a commendable job 
as Marius, providing a sad but gripping 
cry during "Empty Chairs at Empty 
Tab les." 

However, it is the comic reli ef of 
Thenardier O.P. Dougherty) and Madame 
Thenardier (Aymee Garcia) that brings 
joy and laughter to the house. Their ren-
dition of "Master of the House" brings 
laughter and si llines to what would other-
wise be an all-serious musical. 

The spotligh t shines alone on Randal 
Keith, who plays ValJcan . The \'ocal range 
reqlllrcd for Valjean's part is denlJnding 
and changes rapidly, hut Keith hit, all the

'K-PAX' fails to leave the ground 
Kevin Spacey is the only worthwhile to reason see the film 
By JOSH CROUSE 
Senior Staff Writer 

Kevin Spacey has proven time and time agai n that he is one of the best actors of his generation. He even has twO 
Academy Awards to prove it. 

That being said, "K-PAX" is a poor 
attempt at an intellecnl:ll commentary about 
everyday life and questioning onc's beliefs. 

T his is not to say that Spacey does not 
deliver a solid performance with what he 
was given, but that he should probably thi nk 
a littlc harder about what scripts he chooses 
if he wants any more Oscar considerati on in 
the near future. 

UK-PAX" is the story of Prot (Spacey), a 
strange person who police detain at the 
scene of a mugging after he recalls how

bright this planet really is. 
Prot is then turned over to Mark Powell 

Oeff Bridges), a seasoned psychiatrist deter-
mined to treat Prot for what he thinks is 
delusion. 

While in treatment at the psychiatric 
center, Prot interacts with many of the other 
patients in the ward, providing some inter-
esti ng social com mentary along with some 
slight comic relief.

Leap of faith : A blurry, sureal look of a man falling from the skies IS one of the 
many clips combining animation and live action in 'Waki!1g Ll fe~ 

I lowever, when the entire back-
gtOl\l\d of the film is floating and the 
faces of the characters morph con-
tinuously, it becollles dizzying and 
difficult to concentrate on the com-
plex maller of the 111m. 

Starring \Niley Wiggins ("Dazed 
and Confused"), "Waking Life" 
chronicles the journey of a young 
man who cannot \\'ake up from his 
dreams and spcnds most of them lis-
tening to many seemingly random 
peoplc diSCUSS int'lI1gible theories. 

Appcarances fTom other actors 
such as Ethan Ilawke and Adam 
Goldberg seem to be random and 
spontdic with no real ties made 10 
the main character and plot of the 
film, which makes It occasionally 

confusing. 
Although ule fi lm was visually 

remarkable, its presentation con-
trasted with the subject of the 111m. 
In addition, much of the dialogue 
between the random characters is 
very complex and thought-provok-
ing, yet the cartoonish feel of the 
movie takes away from the serious-
nes of the conversations. 

In short, it's hard to concentrate 
on characters w"ho talk about 
abstract meta ph) ical conceplS when 
objeclS in the backb'Tound stJn 110at-
ing or random objects sprout legs 
and start dancing around the speak-

Burning down the house 
with good feelings. 
Over-the-top emotions and canned scenes 
bring down 'Life as a House' 
By ED WU 
Senior Staff Writer 

YOU would htlpe that the pro-ducers of "Lire as a House" would at least come up with 
a title less boring. Fortunately 
for the ca uti ous moviegoer (and 
unfortunately for the picture), 
the movie proves to be every bit 
as blase as its name. 

Kevin Kline stars as a housing 
artist (the kind who bui lds the 
little models for cl ients to see 
before the actual building is crc-
ated) named 

that illustrate George saving his 
son from prostitution, pierci ng 
and drugs, his wife from an 
unfeeling husba nd, and his own 
sen e of pride and self-worth. 

Although the movie's sensibil-
ities do not prevent it from 
humorously portraying shower 
scenes between Sam and attrac-
tive neighborhood gi rl Alyssa 
Gena Malone), the movie's mes-
sage is not only hindered by its 
acceptance of conventional stan-
dards of morality, but it seems to 
advance the cause of convention -

al morality with-
George. George 
is ou tpaced by 
modern 3- D 
house-viewing 
technology and 
gets fired from 
his job on ly to 
find ou t he is 
going to die of 
cancer in four 
months. 

It's a sappy, feel-
good movie for 

people who want 
their ideas about 

the world justified 
by pop culture. 

out any sort of 
justifica tion or 
logic. It 's a sappy,

Whil e movies 

Il is utterly inane life previous 
to these ev(:nts is a divorcee in an 
inherited shack juxtaposed with 
million-dollar homes overlook-
ing the Pacifi c Ocean . It has his 
former wife, Robin (Kristin Scott 
Thol11as), and hi ~ drugged-out, 
pierccd-.tll-ovcr, heavy metal, 
stereotypical, illlgst-ridden 16-
year-old son S:\l11 in a richer 
man 's family down the street. 

When diagnosed with cancer, 
George decides that he's going 10 
tear down the shack that he lives 
in and build a decent house 
before hiS death. 

The four mOl1lhs convenient-
ly encompass summer, so George 
drags his son into the project, to 
Sam's chagrin and anger. What 
ensues is a predictable sequence 
of sappy and contrived scenes 

like "Ameri ca n 
Beauty" make profound state-
ments beca use they justify an 
ambiguous stance without 
resorting to a prepackaged group 
of scenes and morals, "Life as a 
House" gets lumped into the 
sa me group as movies like "Fight 
Club." T hese films are all well 
and good for their genre and for 
the people who appreciate the 
same core villues as their respec-
tive producers, but inane, imma-
ture and trite for the rest of us.

this would not be considered a must-

Audience participation is popular 
throughout the festival, building a 
consistent rowdiness that "docs not 
support the quiet movie-going expe-
rience," Spike said. "You had better 
be prepared for childish comments 
from the more vocal attendee, but 
often it's all in good fun ." 

Intermission entertainment was 
also provided. To the great delight of 
male audience members, there were 
five women up on stage, competing 
in the "Best Ass" competition. The 
pre-show entertainment was three 
massive balloons left to be tossed 
around the auditorium. It's amazing 
how completely enraptun:d people 
become by a large plastic sphere of 
helium. Since when did we all 
become cats? 

There are a string of fabulous 
shorts that can be seen this year: 
"Timmy's Lessons In amre" shows 
you what you expect to happen more 
often to the Crocodile Hunter, and in 
"Voltron & Heroin" you find a cou-
ple of great practical jokes for chil-
dren. "Maakies" was feantred on an 
episode of "Sanlrday Night Live" a 
few years back, but is great whether 
you've seen it before or not. After all , 
when isn't alcohol and suicide a win-
ning combination? Chris Rock's voice 
and head star in "Bad Phone Sex," 
which is humorous, if not predicable. 
Tenacious 0, the .ACOustic-frcaky-
funk duo, and Jack Black of "High 
Fidelity" fame have an animated pres-
ence along with singing the sound-
track to "Fuck Her Gently." 

The great and bizarre Bill 
Plymton (Liquid Television, and the 
animated GEICO ads) has a new 
film, "Eat," that manages to capture 
the sick part of the festival fairly well. 
His t\visting presentation of reality 
constantly blurs tlle lines of fantasy, 
allowing you to see what a character 
is thinking. The vomiting seemed 
inevi table somehow, but the crowd 
was pleased by the queasy sequence.

Wonders of the World 
Dreamworks 

*** Medical miracle work-
ers can transplant a heart 
when the old one fails, giv-
ing new life to a patient. 
The new heart will beat 
on , but can never fully 
repl.acl! the original. The 
ex-group Sublime lost its 
pumping heart with for-
mer . lead si nger Brad 
Nowell 's death in 1996. 
The remaining members 
gained new lead singer 
Opie Ortiz, and the band 
evolved into the Long 
Beach Dub Allstars. 
Though the band's body 
lives on, its heart is some-
times a beat or two off. 

On "Wonders of the 
World," the Allstars bring 
17 tracks of fun in the sun. 
Their music blends upbeat 
punk, reggae and rap with 
a tinge of pop. T hrough 
rhythmic beats and psy-
chedelic effects, they amass 
the three styles of music 
into a colorful cornucopia 
of OK music. 
. "Sunny Hours" is the 
catch tune and has enjoyed 

heavy rotation on major 
radiO stations nationwide. 
Featuring Will.l.Am of the 
Black Eye Peas, this track 
is conducive to rhythmic 
head bopping. vVith a 
Sugar RaY-l!squc l1al'or, 
lhis song keeps it fun . 

The Allstars offer mod-
itlcd reggac in rra ks like 
"It Ain't Ea,y," "Listen To 
DJ's" and "la lkin ' The 
Truth. " The larrer track 
features Paulie elcho 
from The Burn Unit; 
whether his presence acnl-
ally contribute to the 
music is questionable. 

Their So al punk side 
arises in ttacks like "Lies," 
featuring I-Man of Capitol 
Eye, and "Every Mother's 
Dream." Chaotic instru-
mentals and vocal straining 
blend into a cacophonous 
melody of music. 

Though most of the 
tracks are upbeat and best 
enjoyed at a sunny barbe-
cue, songs like "Life Goes 
On," fe(ltu ri ng Half Pink, 
Ives and other rappers, 
show that the All tars 
know how to induce chill. 
Soulful voca ls offer a 
glimpse into the mellow 
ide of tllis band. 

They' re nor Sublime. 
The Long Beach Dub 
Allstars ha~c brought ulcir 
own philosophy into music. 
Ortiz believes that "it would 
be a better world if people 
would just cheer up a little," 
and this credo is seen in his 
music. If only the album 
were as good as his human-
itarian intentions.

since 1992 . Coming from 
the city of San Ysidro, 
Calif., near the U.S.-
Mexico border, "Satellite" 
allowed them to incorpo-
rate an infinite variety of 
textures and styles into 
their already diverse 
sound. 

"We do what we know 
is right for us and that's it," 

onny said. "We don't go 
out there and give a ser-
mon when we gct on stage 
- we don't shove anything 
down anybody's throat. 
But we sing about what's 
real in our lives, and that's 
the bottom line." 

P.O.D.'s uncompromis-
ing lyrics and outstanding 
production on "Satellite" 
lifts spiri ts with a positive 
vibe and rocks our world, 
provoking us to reevaluate 
everytl1ing that is impor· 
tant in our li ves.

with a '70s groove on an 
album that sou nds like it 
was recorded on eqUip-
ment from the '50s. 

Their Web si te says 
that they dress like "their 
clothes from the '70s and 
the '80s fell into the same 
hamper." 

T he New York five-
some got together in 1998 
and played the cene 
fo r nearly a year before 
taking off in the UK 
charts. The United States 
is now coming to appreci-
ate The trokes' unique 
sound . 

Watching the video of 
their first si ngle, "Last 

i te," one gets a good 
sense of what this band is 
all about. 

A sti ll camera films the 
band on a '70s-style sound

THE UCSD GUARDIAN . THURSDAY, OCTOBER ZS, ZOOI THURSDAY, OCTOBER ZS, ZOOI 

IK-PAX': 
Horrible script tries too hard 
to send an empty message 
Continued from pace 11 
nears its end, Powell finds himself 
questioning his own beliefs in real-
ity as he anempts to get to the bot-
tom of the case. 

The film simply falls short in 
providing the sophisticated social 
commentary that it appears to strive 
for. The comic relief is composed of 
cheesy lines and lame jokes that 
sometimes' elicit snickers of pity. 
Overall, the script is weak and the 
performances (aside from Spacey's) 
leave something to be desired. 

Spacey is above-average in his 
role. He does a great job of convinc-
ing not only Powell , but the audi-
ence as well , that he is from another 
planet. He will not get an Oscar nod 
for this role, but he is the only rea-
son to watch the movie. Without his 
performance, this movie would 
most likely be the most painful two 
hours of your entire existence. 

In the other lead role, Bridges 
delivers an absolutely awful perfor-
mance. While he has definitely had 
his share of great roles in the past, 
this one is simply not one of them. 

ary McCormack was linle more 
than eye-candy in her role as 
Bridges' wife. Alfre Woodard was 
average as Bridges' boss at the psy-
chiatric hospital. 

As far as cinemarography and 
directing, there was simply too 
much use of light by director lain 

oftley. He tried to make light 
another character in the movie, but 
the distracting, random use of the 
element fell far short of what the 
director most likely intended. 

Overall, the movie was not very 
good. It had potential to be a 
decent nick, but a poor script coup-
pled with subpar performances 
make this movie one that should 
definitely be left to the video srore, 
if not cable television.

TWisted: 
Stick figures in 'LAmour' and 
'Rejected' s~" provide laughs 
Continued from page 12 
were present again this year; these 
are stick figure animations that man-
age to be some of the furmiest mms 
Spike and Mike have ever shown. 
"Rejected" has actually been nomi-
nated for an Academy Award; it's 
pretty amusing to imagine members 
of the Academy watching that Huffy 
little thing bleeding out of its anus. 
All you can do is laugh. 

If you're not expecting to have 
the absolute limits of good taste and 
judgment pushed back, then Spike 
and Mike will certainly amuse you. 
Fans of early "Beavis and Butthead" 
wi ll rejoice in the simple and often 
blatant gags that take place on 
screen. With around 20 short films, 
you can't really expect every single 
cartoon to be the most entertaini ng 
gem. Yet, what is occasionally disap-
pointing in a mm here or there, is 
more than made up for with the 
other shorts and the atmosphere, 
which includes stage antics involving 
the crowd. 

[n general, almost everybody will 
be pleased by mending, as long as 
they aren't expecting anything more 
than what this' festival is: animation 
that celebrates its own lack of refine-
ment.

611~h t~r~~1~~~~~aI2F~2;allls~so~~~~~;~Jr~?a~m;h~~e~S~Ts readily apparent that the downhill dnve for post-season playoff berths will be as com-petitive as its ever been at the university. 
With plenty of seasoned, veteran teams leading the way, this season's championship 

bowl games should produce some of the most hotly contested action on campus football fields since the 
glory days of Chocolate City , the York Hunt Club, and Raw Meat in the late '70s and early '80s. 
This coming weekend features no less than nine Men's division games that project as super critical to 

the playoff seeding process that will commence at the conclusion of the regular season on Sunday, Nov. 4. 
These games might not live up to the hype of Oklahoma-Nebraska or UCLA-Stanford this week, but to 
the guys playi ng them, it will be pretty close. Here's a quick look at much of the big game schedule for 
UCSD IMs this coming weekend. 
Men's AAA 
Alcoholics (2-1) vs, liquor Box (2-0) Friday at 5pm

Disciples (2-1) vs_ Cunning Stunts (2-1) Sat. at 10am 
Buffaloes AA League may be most competitive top-to-bottom in IMs with these two teams in a dead heat lor second 

place at the moment. Stunts took a powder last week against top-rated Thundercats (losing big 30-6) and will have to 
rebound to stay alive lor a chance at playoll plckins. 
Ficus (3-0) vs. Illegal Immigrants (2-1) Sat at 12 noon 
A Win by the liquor Box JV squad would pretty much wrap up the Bruin League championship. but with rumors that all 

U S borders Will be relaXing their standards thiS Saturday, the Illegal Ones have a chance to recruit some Iresh new talent. 
Men's A 
Smooth Operators (2-0) vs. Da Kine (3-0) Sat at 1 pm 
Two over-the-top teams that clearty should be and will be plaYing up come playolltime. Plenty 01 delense and plenty 

01 points are hallmarks 01 these two sandbagging geniuses. Something will have to give this weekend, but Da Kine's

Stoner: 
Arizona has the pitching 
edge over Yankees 
Continued from pase 20 
in perspective, the D-backs com-
mitted 41 fewer errors than the 
Oakland Athletics, whose horrible 
defense handed the Yanks the 
clinching game on a silver platter. 

Looking at momentum: 
Arizona has the edge there as well. 

• Although momentum in the sport-
ing world isn't as easy as multiply-
ing the mass by the velocity vector 
squared (like it is in physics), sev-
eral factors point to this conclu-
sion. 

The Diamondbacks battled the 
whole season because they were 
locked in a tight division race and 
unable to clinch until the last week 
of the season. The Yankees were 
helped by the ollapse of the Red 
Sox and coasted into the postsea-
son. 

The Yankees just completed two 
tough series with the A's and 
Mariners, while the Diamondbacks 
have had extra time to rest - an 
advantage in the postseason after 
everyone has pl ayed 162-plus 
games. To top it all off, the 
Diamondbacks start the series at 

Because: 
Jeter leads the 
experienced Yankees 
Continued from page 20 
prime. If you take a look at 
Arizona's lineup, only Gonzalez 
had more than 100 RBis. 

Now t~ke a look at the Yankees' 
lineup. Jeter is one of the best hit-
ters in the game, especially in the 
clutch, as he has proven time and 
time again. David Justice is slump-
ing, but his postseason numbers put 
him among October's all -time 
greats. 

Bernie Willtams is Mr. Clutch 
for the Yankees in the Series. 
T hrow in hot-hitting Jorge Posada 
and Tino Martinez, and you have a 
studly lineup that will light up 
Arizona 's pitching. 

-Speaking of pitching, let's look 
a t the twO sta ffs . 

Arizona has two of the best 
starters in the ga me. Randy 
Johnson and Curt Schi lling are 
awesome and ca n shut teams 
down. Unfortunately for them, 
they cannot win the Series by 
themselves. T he rest of the 

Crew: 
Pinkerton had a strong 
individual showing 
Continued from page 20 

The disappointing finish did not 
affect the 1ritons' positive atti-
tudes. 

"They behaved really we ll ," 
Pinkerton sai~. ,:'Thcy were really 
mature about It. 

By Sunday's race, the light-
weight four boat, which finished 
with a time of 20:23, was ready to 
go. 

"They had the advantage that 
they got to see the course," 
Pinkerton said. 

The four-boat was staffed by 
coxswain Claire Romelfanger, co-
captai n Emi ly Gray, Claire Doyle, 
Liz Jones and JaiOli e Smith. It was 
the first varsity long-distance race 
for Jones and Smith. . 

Pinkerton said the Tritons did 
remarkably well, con idering how 
little training the new and rerum-
ing team members received. 

"It's so early in the season for 
us," Pinkerton said. "We've barely 
been back a month." 

Pinkerton also said that it was 
tough to choose which crew mem-
bers would attend the regatta. 

"It's not enough to just be really 
strong," she said. "You have to race 
with a team." 

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 25, 2001 

Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix and 
have the chance to snatch two vic-
tories in the desert before heading 
to New York. 

In those fi rst two games, 
Arizona will be starting a couple of 
well-rested, healthy pitchers: Curt 
Schilling and Randy Johnson. 
They have been untouchable this 
postseason, while the Yankees' No. 
I pitcher, Roger Clemens, hasn 't 
thrown more than 100 pitches and 
was benched early due to leg prob-
lems in a game against Oakland. 
The Yankees had difficulties hit-
ting Oakland's solid trio of young 
pitchers - hitting agai nst twO vet-
eran power pitchers will be a lot 
harder. 

The last reason that makes me 
think the Diamondbacks wi ll win is 
a bit trite and probably very naive: 
They will win because the Yankees 
have to lose. There is no way a 
franchise can win forever, and this 
year is as good as any for them to 
lose. They are obviously not as 
strong as they have been in the 
past, and after barely surviving two 
exhaustive series, they are worn out 
and tired. 

T he mighty Yankees are start-
ing to crumble. \Vhat the fans sec 
this World Series might not just 
be a team losing, but the end of an 
era. 

Diamondbacks' rotation is full of 
pitchers that had one good stretch 
during the year and then faded 
late. Throw in a closer who has 
been horrible in the later part of , 
the year and you have a shaky staff 
at best. 

The edge in pitching goes to the 
Yankees. Roger Clemens has peen 
hurt, but few guys can perform as 
he can in the clutch. Andy Pettite 
has been one of the best pitchers of 
the postseason. Mike Mussina is a 
proven ace who can shut down even 
the most fearsome of lineups - the 
weak Diamondbacks lineup should 
be cake. 

\Nhen it comes to the bullpen, 
nobody can compare to the nearly 
unhittable Mariano Rivera and his 
srudly serup man, Mike Stanton. 

The m~nag'eria l comparison is 
no contest. \Nh ile Bob Brcnly is a 
great guy, he simply can't compare 
to the mastery of Joe Torre, who 
has been there and back in the 
postseason, and always seems to 
make the right moves to help his 
tcam win. 

\Nhen it comes down to it, the 
Yanks will handle the D-backs in 
five, no sweat. 

Because I said so. 

To make her selection, 
Pinkerton focused on the 6,000-
meter timed pieces, te hnique and 
attitude of the crew members. In 
addi tion, those competing for a 
spot on the lightweight boat had to 
be under 138 Ibs., and the weight 
distribution of the vessel had to 
average 130 lbs. 

Besides coaching and suPPOrt-
ing the rwo boats representing 
UCSD, Pinkerton al 0 competed 
in a single boat. She finished sixth 
out of 18 boats. She was plea ed 
with her placement, considering 
she had not been feeling well for 
several days prior to the event. 

Doing well in tl1is regatta is 
nothing new to Pinkerton, however 
- she competed in it in the 1980s 
when she was training for the ' 
National Team-and agai n in the 
1990s. 

According to Pinkerton, the 
course itself hasn't changed much 
over the years, but the atmosphere 
surrounding this prestigious com-
petition has definitely altered. 

"It·s gotten so much bigger," 
she said. 

Pinkerton's ranking earned her 
a guaranteed entry next year. 

Yet when reflecting on the 
weekend's races, Pinkerton focused 
on the benefits for her team rather 
than herself. 

"I think we got what we wanted 
out of the race, which was experi-
ence," she said.

Cross country hosts CCAA meet 
Tritons enjoy some success at championship race 
By JOSH CROUSE 
Sports Editor 

UCSD hosted the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
cross country championships Oct. 
20. 

It was important to the UCSD 
team to have the event at home 
and to nave it go well. 

"We were very proud to host 
this event," aid head coach Ted 
Van Arsdale. "It went off fl awlessly 
thanle. to the efforts of llIany dif-
ferent people and organizations." 

The '1 r lton~ filmhcd third over-
_a ll in the men's diVision and fifth 
overall in the women s divi Ion. 
Van Arsdale was pleased with some 
of the performances, but aclmowl-
edged room for improvement. 

TRIATHLON 
The ucsn triathlon team, a 

new club sport on campus, 
proved itself Sept. 30 with con-
vincing individual and team 
accomplishments at the final 
event of tile collegiate triathlon 
Series. 

The male and female squads 
competed on an Olympie dis-
tance course that included a 
1,500-meter swim, a 4O-kilome-
ter biking trail and a 10-kilome-
ter run. 

Brendan O 'Brien led the 
men's team and took first place 
overall at the event. 

He said that he thinks the team 
can and will nm better in the 
future. 

UC Davis ran away with the 
competition, winning' both men's 
and women's overall awards and 
having 14 runners - seven men 
and seven women - make the All -
CCAA team. The A11 -CCAA team 
was comprised of the top 15 men 
and the top 15 women of the day. 

Charging ahead: A Tnton runner pushes on during the CCAA championships that 
were held at UCSD last Saturday. UCSD had one runner make the All-CCAA team. 

The women's team dorninat-
ed, too. Tritons Esther Merki, 
Megan Anderson and Michelle 
Wedemeyer took first, second 
and third places, respectively. 

In addition to individual 
accomplishments, the triathlon 
team also secured team honors. 
The race II131'ked the end of the 
collegiate series, which began in 
April. · Teams competed for 
points that would determine the 
winner of the West Coast colle-
giate tide. With the strong fin-
ish at the event, ucsn earned 
the title of West C02St 
Collegiate Champions. 

"UC Davis was on fire," Van 
Arsdale said. "They ran quite well 
and were able to put together a 
great race." 

The tOP finisher for the Triton 
men's team wasJulian Nahan, who 
finished 16th with an 8,OOO-meter 
time of 26:50. The time was espe-
ciall y impressive for Nahan, 
because it was only tus third race 
of the year. 

"This was [Nahan'sl first race 
back for us," Van Arsdale s.1id. "He 
hurt himself ea rly and has only 
competed in three events. lie ran 
very well ~ ·r .me circumstances." 

Triron Neil Kalra finished 18th 
in a time of 26:55. 

"[Kalral made a valiant run for 
us," Van Arsdale said. "He is not 
used to running at the head of the 
pack for us, but he did it here and 
ran quite we ll." 

The twO made up for subpar 
performances from the rest of 
UCSD's squad. 

"Our other athletes had a bad 
day Out there," Van Arsdale said. 
"They really picked it up for us." 

The rop fil~isher for the Triron 
women was Audrey Sung, who 
pl aced inh with a 6,OOO-meter 
time of 22 :46. The finish earned 
her A11-CCAA honors for the meet. 

"[Sungl made a good move ro 
move up in the back in the last 
mile," Van Arsdale said. "The All-
CCAA team is rcally her caliber. I 

J 

think that she will handle the girls 
that fini shed ahead of her better at 
the regional meet." 

Van Arsdale was pleased with 
the performers of his rop runners, 
but saw room for improvement 
farther back in the ranks. 

" I think that our women ran 
very well up front," Van Arsdale 
said . "I think that we sti ll need 
some development further back." 

Triton faithful need not worry 
about UCSD's finish at this meet 
because Van Arsdale points to the 
regional and national meets as the 
team's real focus for the year. 

"We were really looking to tar-
get the regional and national 
meets more than this con ference 
meet," Van Arsdale said . "We 
should perform better at those 
rneets,"

The spiteful, jeal-
ous screams of the 
more intense 
Yankees-haters will 
be drowned out by 
a strange sound 
that the Yankees 
stil l aren't used to 
hearing on the 
road.

UPCOMING EVENTS 

T he "damn Yankees" are 
hc"ding to the ir 27 th \Vorl d 
Series and fo r the first time in 
eons it won't just be New Yorkers 
who want them to win. Instead, 
they will be Amcrica's sentimen-
tal favo rite, the li vi ng symbol of 
the determina tion and resiliency 
of New York and its inhabitants. 

Everybody except me. 
The Yankees arcn't my senti-

mental favorite to win the World 
Series. It's not just because I hate 
the Yankees. I also hate the. 
Diamondbacks, yet they arc my 
pick to win the World Seri es. 

The D-backs are the youngest 
franchise ever to make it to a 
World Series, bur their lineup is 
stocked wi th seasoned veterans. 
Seventeen of their players arc 
over 30. They spon one 42-year-
old pitcher, Mike Morgan, who 
defines the term "journeyman" 
with what is likely his last stop in 
" ca reer that spans two decades 
and 12 different teams. T hey

God bless America, for it 
is only in a country 
like this that a man 
like George 
Ste i nbrenner 
could buy power 
as he has done 
with his New York 
Yankees. 

As unbelievable as it sounds, 
the Yankees will win the \Vorld 
Series for the fifrh time in the 
past six years. They will do this 
for one simple reason: The 
Ya nkees cannot lose big games. 

T he Bronx Bombers are the 
grea test franchise in baseball his-
wry. From Babe Ruth to Derek 
J cter, the Yankees have always 
produced players that perform in 
the clutch and tha t ~ imply will 
not let thei r team lose. 

Witness J etcr and his phe-
nomenal defensive pl,IY in game 
thrcc of the I\mcriean League 
DIVI Sion ~enes again~ t the 

Athletics. He saved the Yankees ' 
season. Jeter, whose initial posi-
tion in the play was cutoff man 
between right field and third 
base, came tearing across the 
infield to grab an errant throw 
and relay it to Jorge Posada in 
time for the crucial out. T he 
Yankees dismantled the A's in the 
next two games. 

T he Mariners put up a better 
fight, but to no avai l as tbe 
mighty Yanks took the series in 
five en route to the Worl d 
Series. 

Now the Yankees face an 
Arizona team that resembles a 
senior citizens' center more than 
a baseball fra nchise. The 
Diamondbacks are fu ll of veter-
an players who have performed 
well enough to make it this far, 
but this is as far as "they'll go. 
The Yankees simply have a bet-
ter tcam. My prediction: T he 
Yanks will take it in five. 

First, take a look at the line-
ups for the respective clubs. 

The Diamondbacks have 
Luis Gonzalez. They also have ... 
wait, he's their only offensive 
threat. Reggie Sanders is a 
washed-up outfielder who can 
occasionally turn on a meat fast-
ball and knock it over the w.lll. 
Who else do the Diamoodbacks 
have? Mark Grace? Matt 
\Villiams? T hese players wcre

Crew has 
strons 
shOWing 
at regatta 
Tri tons gain 
expen ence at 
worldwide race 
in Boston 
By CARRIE ELIZABETH SKLAR 
Staff Writer 

At the annual "Ilead of Ihe 
Charles Regatta" in Boston last 
weekend, UCSD women 's crew gOI 
more than an experience of a life-
time - they also earned training 
that will serve them well in the 
coming season. 

The Tritons were represented 
by two boats: a lightweight four, 
which finished seventh Ollt of 16 
boats, and an open-eight, which 
came in 52nd out of 55 boats. 

Over 500 clubs and over 6,000 
competitors attended the eve.nt, 
which is the world's largest regatta. 
Because it is a noncollegiate event, 
many of these teams were from 
other countries. 

Entry to the regatta is guaran-
teed only for the top 5 percent of 
last year's finishers, with a lottery 
for the remaining spots. The two 
TritOn entries marked the first time 
in history that UCSD was repre-
sented in the competition . 

"With the fact that we 've never 
gone before; I think they looked 
kindly on our entries," head coach 
Pa ttie Pinkerton said. 

The course was 5,000 meters 
long with a staggered start to rank 
finishers by time. Rule violations 
such as going over buoys, failint;" to 
start 10 seconds after the preceding 
boat, and failing to yield to a pass-
ing boat resulted in time penalties 
at the end of the race. 

UCSD's eight-man boat was the 
first to race for the Tritons, which 
Pinkerton feels contributed to its 
finishing time of 20:20. 

"I just think it was a bit over-
whelming," Pinkerton said. 

Another obstacle was that only 
co-captai n Sara Patton was a 
retu rning varsity member. Her 
teammates included coxswain 

icole Lloyd, Brooke Albiston,Jen 
Wolsborn, Amber Hopkins, 
Stefanic Barriere, Alexis Kleckner, 
Anastasia Bolaris and Amanda 
Mamlquist. 

"We had a lot of people who had 
never rowed before, so it was a real -
ly young team," Pinkerton said. 

Despite the influx of novice 
rowers, Pinkerton was still sur-
prised by their final placement of 
52 . 

"[ really thought we 'd fini sh in 
the top half," she said. "We are so 
much better ..!!'tan the race rencet-
cd." 

-After such a heartbreaking race, 
Pinkerton sa id she is still proud of 
her team. 

" ['m not disappointed in them 
because I know they did a supcr 
job," she .said. "But I'm disa pPolll t-
ed for them because they tried rea l-
ly hard ."
