TCHAKALIAN 

A peSD st udent and 
Collegiate AssociatIOn for the 

Re~earch of Principles (CARP) 
president , John Holmes spends 
"100 hours or more" working 
in Reverend Sun Myung 
Moon" movement to unify 
world Christianity and 
eventually all religions. A 
Third college senior and 
Campus Crusade for Christ 
(CCC) student leader, Le lie 
Vaughn spend only "around 
10" hours per week working to 
"offer students information 
and training on how to have a 
relationship with God through 
Jesus Chri t." Vaughn i aided 
by Michael Neily, the local, 
full ·time Campus Crusade 
staff advisor. Both CARP and 
CCC are well·known religlOu: 
groups on campus. and both 
are representative...; of a new 
kind of religious movement 
which functions under the 
careful scrutiny of legislators 
and the leaders of established 
reltglons. 

What are they domg at

The ecc is perhap best-
known for its "initiative

campaigns . According to 
Nelly, in the past four years

populat Ion met wit h one or 
moreCee member .... Last year 
alone, the tTC J) Lhapter 
engaged some 3,700 s tudents 
in conversations about life and 
God. 

"We act as a spiritual 
resource," explained Vaughn. 
"College provides intellectual 
stimulation, but doesn't meet 
students' spiritual needs ... . 
We're centered on Jesus 
Christ, the Bible, and what he 
taught." Of the 107 active 
members of this non -
denom inational C hri tian 
student organization, 30 are 
"more highly committed" and 
lead bible studies. In addition,

Office of Religious Affatn;, put 
it, "My response is that the

the fine line between 
presentation and Qut and out

extremely enthu iastic 
individuals carrymg on their 
enthusiasm above what ot hers

campus reltgious officer, 
explained: " ... They (cecI are

" baSIS of mo t reltglOn, " Miller 
said, "IndiViduals who truly 
practtce their religion are ro he 
respected and allowed to

Vaughn and Neily are 
careful to point out that many 
CCC member are church-
goer and that the CCC 
financial records are made 
public. AI 0, they point out 
that central to their belief IS 
the deity of Je u Christ-

rise of the new evangeltsm IS a 
reflection of the ne\\

and the electIOn of Jimmv 
Carter. Newsweek named 1976

Letter to the Editor 

Let's preserve our 
American Graffiti 
Editor: 

We, the wall-writers of 
UCSD, would like to air an 
opinion on graffiti. That 
opinion, which has long been 
an issue for us, concerns what 
we feel is the difference 
between graffiti and vanda-
lism. We are practicing what 
we view as an unsanctioned 
form of public art which some 
people feel is vandalism. The 
net result is that our art i 
vulnerable to defacement and 
destruction. We are acutely 
aware of this vulnerability, 
but tIii does not Ie en the 
hock of finding a carefully 

wrought piece of work 
destroyed. How do you think 
an arti t or poet reacts when a 
work he labored on for hour is 
destroyed by spray-paint? 

Perhaps that is where our 
problem as wall-writers lies. 
We view most of what we put 
up on the walls as art; poems, 
e says, stories, sketche and 
paintings . We admit to 
babblings on the wall , but 
they're usually put up out of 
the exuberance of being with 
friends. After we've patted 
each other on the back for 
clever turns of phrase and 
other literary 'acrobatics, the 
talk often turns to how to 
remove permanent - ink 
babbling; becausethespaceis 
needed for poems or paintings. 
For t hat is our main deSIre as 
wall-w n ters and it inerant 
artist/philosophers: to fill the 
blank, dull , mundane , 
unmspiring walls of UCSD 
with life. Idealis tic. poignant. 
sa d, or hopIng poem s. 
Painting that catch your 
breath or imply make you ay 
"Wow." Or giggle if you feel so 
inclined . This i supposedly an 
in<;titution of learning, a place 

The Bottom Line 

to stimulate your mind and 
imagination. Too many people 
here forget that. Wall-writers 
attempt to say, "Hey! Look at 
this world_ It can be beautiful, 
alive_ Walls don't have. to be 
off-white. even if they're ink-
resistant. This world doesn't 
have to be impersonal, even if 
at first it appears people-
re istant. It will be what you 
make it. Or don't, " That's 
what we see as art. 

Vandalism is a different 
tory. We are deeply hurt by 

the destruction of our 
painting . They take hour of 
careful work and lots of love to 
put uP. and only moments to 
destroy. We are at a loss as to 
why. Wall-writers as a whole 
are fairly well-adjusted , 
loving, semi-rebellious adults. 
When we become angry we 
write it up on the walls (if it 
goes up), and never do we blot 
out or deface someone el e's 
work. It isn't considered polite. 
It is difficult for us to 
understand the frustration 
and anger that lies behind 
these defacements of our art. 
And how do we stop the 
mutilation? An immediate 
answer is to stop putting them 
up, but we don't want to do 
that; givingupis not our spirit. 
And mo~t people we have 
talked to. including those that 
walk in on us as we're 
painting, say that they enjoy 
t hem and hope we'll do more. So 
what do we do? [ there an 
an wer in opening up certain 
tairwells for poe ms and 

paintings ? Anar

Letter to the Editor 

The Iranian people are more 
determined to get democracy 
Editor: 

The recent history of Iran is 
a saga of thecontinuingefforts 
of the iranian people to throw, 
off t he yoke of foreign 
domination and puppet 
dictator ' hips. Three years 
ago. in February, 1979. the 
Iranian people tOlJpled the 
Shah. The 1979 revolution 
cost Iranians over 70.000 lives 
and many more were wounded 
or disabled. This heavy toll 
was in addition to thousands 
more killed by shah and his 
father during the last 50 years. 

In com memorating these 
martyrs in Teheran's major 
cemetary, Khomeini promised 
an end to suppression, 
censorship, torture and 
injustice of every description. 

But the long martyrdom of 
I ran was not ended as 
Khomeini promised . Instead. 
those gains won by the 
revolution were withdrawn; 
and the new government 
surpassed the old in several 
aspects. The hopes that had 
fueled the revolution were 
dimmed. Women, who had 
played a more prominent role 
in the Iranian revolution than 
in any other revolution in 
history, were again deprived of 
their rights and their jobs. The 
Kurdi s h minority were 
s ubjected to continued 
oppression and violence. 
Progressive and opposition 
papers were banned; a ll media 
communication was censored. 
Savak. the s hah 's notoriou s 

secret police, was resurrected 
under a new name, and in the 
guise of pro -Khomeini 
students, their agents became 
engaged in harassing, beat ing 
and killing Iranian students 
abroad who oposed Kho-
meini 's oppressive policies. As 

The Iranian people 
did not ''get what 
they asked for" ... 

in EI Salvador and Turkey, the 
right-wing gangs were given 
carte blanche to terrorize any 
opposition voice. These gangs 
were supported by the security 
forces and were associated 
with Khomeini's Islamic 
Republican Party. The 
univer ities were shut down 
and a backward constitution 
was written by an assembly 
which was 93 percent 
composed of clergymen. Yet , 

The Iranian people 
will triumph, even 
in isolation 

this constitution was of little 
ignificance to the rulers of 

Iran. as Mas'ud Rajavi, a 
lead{ r of People's Mojahedin 
Organization, who had a very 

. wide base of support among 
the people. was unilaterallv 

excluded from the presidential 
election by Khomeini. This 
unconstitutional act was 
completed when President 
Bani-Sadr, who was elected in 
the absence of competitor , 
was later ousted himself by 
Khomeini . Thi act, which 
wa engineered to consolidate 
Khomeini 's power was met 
with the people's anger and 
dismay. As the largest. 
revolutionary organization, 
dedicated to the cause of 
democracy, who had lost many 
of their members both before 
and after the revolution , 
Mojahedin called for a peaceful 
rally against dictatorship. The 
overwhelming response of 
500,000 people to the 
Mojahedin rally .alarmed the 
government and proved to 
Khomeini that he could no 
longer fool the Iranian. He 
ordered the "revolutionary 
guards" (Khomeini's notori-
ous national gUards) to open 
fire on the unarmed 
demon trators. 50 were killed 
and another 300 were 
wounded. This day Gune 20, 
1981) was considered a 
turning point in which the 
government finally took 
charge for the activities of the 
right-wing gangs and 
completed its gradual 
movement toward absolute 
dictatorship. 

Since then, more than 
15.000 political dis idents 
have been executed . According

True confessions of a mad Republican 
By T. MATTHEW RANKIN 

Editor's Note: The author is 
a second-year l-tui r College 
student majorin! in Computer 
Science. His IT ain area of 
interest is th,! design 01 
computer-gener,tted guerilla 
warfare simu ,ations. He 
described his most vivid 
childhood memJry for the 
Guardian recent ly: 

"I guess I was about thirteen 
or fourteen at tht: time, serving 
with a group of South Africans 
and Australians in Uganda. 
The Soviets were attempting 
to build one of their 
underground missile bases in a 
small village in the middle of a 
game reserve and we'd been 
hired to, uh, 'discourage' 
them. 

"The Sovs had put together a 
really nasty band of 
Palestinians to keep an eye on 
things and I was chosen to run 
reconnaissance. I climbed on 
2!! 01rl Honda 350 with an AK-
47, a small Isradi missile 
launcher and about a dozen 
French-made grenades. 

"I won't go into detail about 
my run, but it was my greatest 
success. I didn't take a single 
prisoner_" 

I owe my sanity to Ken 
Kesey, but my life was saved 
by Alexander Haig, who 
discovered me in a pork barrel 
buried in the jungles of 
VietNam. A child of Greed and 
Avarice, I was abandoned by 
my mother, selling out 
America for the cheap labor in 

IndoneSIa. 
Alex raised me in a child's 

fantasy; the war zones of the 
free world. When Alex took the 
reins at NATO, I was set 
adrift, finally meeting Ken 
during a party at Camp David. 
We hit it off right away, and I 
ended up managing his secret 
biomass plantations in 
Central America. 
-1982 

The land of manana behind 
me for a while. I found myself 
piloting a state department 
Mercedes Turbodiesel 
through {he Oregon (Or-EE-
gun) fog on themorningofthat 
special Sunday. 

Ken was in fine form when I 
met him, proferring a candy 
dish full of blotter acid and 

, .... 

waving his arms above his 
head . After breakfast, we 
jogged out to where he had left 
the tractor. It was then I 
noticed the drops of water that 
fell from the tip of his nose 
were pulling multicolored 
trails. Good Shit. 

With all but one kid safely in 
college, Ken was looking 
forward to putting out another 
book. And like any Jood 
author, he'd already wntten 
the damned thing in his head. 
We spent most of the morning 
discussing the book (ethics 
prevent my detailing) and 
rolling hysterically through 
the thick mud. 

Skipping lunch, we took off 
through th~ back roads in the 
Mercedes, our muddy clothes 

sullying the efficient Teutonic 
upholstery. As I rounded a 
blind corner, I took out a kid on 
a motocross bike, but thank 
God it was only a flesh wound. 
I dropped him at the hospital 
with a few C-notes and we 
stopped by Burger King for 
some grease_ 

Actually, this was more 
than a mere joy-ride, it was a 
highly scientific road test of 
our newest product: the sap of 
the copaiba tree, indigenous of 
Brazil that we had cultivated 
in Uruguay. Swear to God, this 
sap, unrefmed, burns just like 
diesel fuel. Ken was impressed 
and I was bursting with drug· 
enhanced pride. 

It had been a real hassle

Letter to the Editor 

G henis reinforces -his stand 
on the Falkland Islands war 
Editor: 

I am moved to write this 
letter in response to the 
outrageous slander directed 
against me Tuesday Gune 1) 
by Frank Webster in his 
"English Viewpoint," as my 
best means of protecting my 
name and reputation. In my 
letter last week I made one 
point: American media is 
purposefully influencing 
public opinion by not 
publishing the major 
historical facts related to the 
Argentine claim over the 
MalvinaslFalklands. I then 
listed some of these facts, 
writing not as an Argentine 
but simply as an observer; 
every single statement made 
in my letter is backed up by 
documentation contained in a 
2(}.page dossier I have com-
piled after careful research. I 
did fail though, to let the read· 
ers know who I am. not 
expecting to encounter people 
like Mr. Webster, who would 
then assume the worst about 
me, identifying me with the 
military junta and then 
labeling my article as regime 

. propaganda, and having the 
nerve to publish it all. 

First, I wish to (finally) 
introduce myself: I was born 
22 years ago in a lewish family 
of Bueno Aires and I'm 
presently pursuing BAs in 
biophysics and math here at 
UCSD. U I had to choose three 
labels for myself, they would 

be "Human being," "Liberal" 
and "Truthseeker_" I'm a finn 
believer in Democracy as the 
only just way of government, 
and I deeply resent the present 
lack of it not only in Argentina, 
but in most of Latin America_ 
Any public statement 
portr'aying me as Mr. Webster 
did constitutes nothing short 
of slander, and must be 
corrected at once. 

I would like to briefly 
answer to a few of Mr_ 
Webster's arguments: 

- "Pressuring the 
inhabitants to leave" really 
means forcing them to board a 
ship to the mainland at 
gunpoint, the "dozen or so" 
were actually 350 shepherds 
and farmers and 50 soldiers, 
and "transitory inhabitants" 
means that the British crown 
decided they would no longer 
be allowed to be "permanent" 
ones. 

- As far as the fate of the 
captured islands, which at 
that time were strategically 
very desirable, there were no 
more civilians there until 
1867. 34 years after the 
invasion; obviously the 
"transitory" Argentine 
population had already been 
efficiently expelled by the time 
the first Kelpers arrived from 
England. 

- Quoting me as justifying 
the Argentine action because 
of nationalism is simply a lie, 
as anyone who read my May 

24th letter will know. The 
straw that broke the camel's 
back after 17 years of futile 
negotiations was Britain's 
imperial arrogance last 
February in calling for a 25 
year freeze in talks. ridiculing 
UN res. 2065. 

- In his argument, Mr. 
Webster continuously talks 
about the Argentinian junta, 
implicitly mixing it up with 
the Argentinian people and 
even drawing subtle and 
dangerous parallels with Nazi 
Germany. The junta is only 
six years old, whereas this 
conflict is much older than 
that, and the people are 

.definitely not the same as the 
military. For someone who 
realizes that crises make 
strange political bedfellows, it 
should not be too hard to see 
that this is true on the 
Argentinian side as well. 

- Finally, labeling my 
accusations against the 
American media as "obscene" 
because things in Argentian 
are presently worse is simply a 
poor argument. Not saying 
why he thinks they're 
"mistaken" is poor too. Mr. 
Webster can't do any better 
simply because it cannot be 
denied that in spite of great 
freedom of press, American 
media choose to omit 
information and give biased 
accounts. I will not speculate 
on the reasons for this, but the 
facts are there for all to see. 

Communicating with our 
peers through the pages of a 
paper is a right, but it carries 
with it a great responsibility, 
that of informing the 
uninformed. To do this 
properly means not simply 
writing off the top of one's 
head but first searching for the 
real facts with determination 
and exposing them. limiting 
any subjectivity to an 
interpretation of reality. not a 

3 

distortion of it. The goal 
should be to become as much of 
the Scientific A merican type of 
journalist and as little of the 
National Enquirer kind as 
possible. Frank Webster didn 't 
do any homework before 
typing away, and with his 
abundant malice and gross 
inaccuracies he clearly failed 
to reach this goal. 

Pablo Ghenis 

The Iranian people 
desire a democracy 
continued from page 2 
to the Amnesty International 
tally, even the figure of 4000 
executions (reported by AI in 
December issue of Amnesty 
action) is three-and-a-half 
times more than all other 
executions combined in the 
world over the past year. In 
December, Amnesty Inter-
national declared [ran to bethe 
number one violator of human 
rights. 

The Iranian people did not 
"get what they asked for" 
after the 1979 revolution . 
They asked for freedom, 
human liberty , justice and an 
end to inhumane conditions of 
life. What they got instead was 
promises that never came 
true. 

Although Khomeini 's 
slogans fooled the Iranian 
people in 1979. they cannot be 
blamed for being deceived . 

Iran is a nation with a 
strong tradition of religion. 
While the Mojahedin and other 
revolutionary organizations 
were under seige and had to 
operate clandestinely under 
the shah, the mullahs were 

able to monopolize the ready-
made structure of mosques 
and religious ceremonies to 
dim b into power after the 1979 
revolution. With Mojahedin 
and Fedayeens in prison, the 
people's dismay and hatred for 
shah's dictatorship crystal-
ized itself in blind obedience 
for the only other available 
alternative, Khomeini. 

However, the bitter 
memories of the shah's regime 
and the devastating experi-
ences of the past three years, 
added to Mojahedin's' efforts 
have rai ed the political 
consciousness of the Iranian 
people. Thi s raised conscious-

Letter to tt,e Editor 

CAP.E.looks into the future 
Editor: 

We at the CAPE staff would 
like to say tllank you for all of 
the student and professor su» 
port given us during our recent 
petition drive. So far, about 
1,000 people have signed our 
petitions and through your 
efforts it looks like CAPE will 
be able to continue on through 
the summer. Yes, the all· new 

81-82 CAPEs will be available 
sometime around the first few 
weeks of September and if it 
weren't for your signat ures we 
probably wouldn't have one at 
all. 

That's the good news. Now, 
the bad news. 

Funding after this issue is 
still a big MAYBE. You see, the 
problem is on the state level. 

and politics aside, it boils down 
to some simple mathematics. 
The state has a $2-2 112 billion 
deficit and it wants to elimi· 
nate the $125,000 program 
from which CAPE's $50,000 
plus is drawn. No $125,000, no 
CAPE. And since we're not 
particularly thrilled about 
coughing up the ghost this 
leaves us with a ticklish prob-

lem: how do we cough up the 
dough? 

1) AS: Maybe, maybe not. 
Certainly there's no way that 
the AS can handle something 
as big as CAPE by itself. They 
don't have the money. How· 
ever, we've talked to Henry 
Chu and he says we might be 
able to get some partial fund-
ing. And we might not. 

2) The Provost Offices: A

likely possibility. However, 
how woulc1 you like paying for 
CAPE out of your own pocket? 
We'd like some feedback on the 
issue. 

4) Advertising: This is a big· 
gie. Between La Jolla Vilage 
Square, UTC and downtown 
La Jolla we should get enough 
advertising to choke a horse, 
especially if we try. And you 
can bet your booties this is just 
exactly what we'regoingtodo. 
But too much advertising can 
clutter CAPE so much you 
won't be able to read it. 

5) Increase the price: Sorry, 
guys, but that's the way it is. 

----------------------------------------------, The price may goup to a dollar 
next year. Like it or not, CAPE 
has got to become more inde· 
pendent of everybody's 
money ... or else you may not

"some fishing ports up north." 
The community action branch 
of the Unification movement, 
Project Volunteer, seems to see 
its role as "inspiring the 
restimulation of the idea of 
fishing," Perry Cordel, a 
member of the Los Angeles 
branch of the Unification 
Church, said. Through some 
v~e "independent enterpri-
se' the Unification Church 
owns a fleet of 30 fishing boats 

in Gloucester and Alabama. 
"The inspiration comes from 
Rev. Moon," explained Cordel. 
"We're not trying to single-
handedly re·establish the 
(fishing) industry ... Too much 
of America's resources aren't 
being used ... and the waters 
are being fished by foreigners 
and foreign governments." 

Despite charges to the 
contrary, Holmes maintains,

Toxic chetnicals 
spilled at Bonner 

By SCOTT YOUNG 
UCSD's Bonner Hall was 

the site of a dangerous 
chemical spill yesterday 
afternoon, fortunately 
resulting in no injuries. 

The spill involved osmium 
tetraoxide and glutaralde-
hyde, two very toxic organic 
chemicals used to preserve and 
color cells and tissues for 
electron microscope viewing. 

Approximately 150 people 
were evacuated from the 
building in the wake of the 
spill, which occurred in the 
basement room number 1509. 
The ventilation system was 
not shut down until about one 
hour after the spill, causing 
concern that the wind would 
carry the chemical fumes all 
over campus. 

Even though officials roped 
off an area about )00 yards 
downwind of the building, the 
evacuation was described M a 
"purelr precautionary 
measure' by the San Diego 
City Fire department. The 
campus department of 
Environmental health and 
Safety (EHS) was undertaking 
clean-up measures at press 
time. 

The chemicals were stored 
in a one gallon container full 
of a mixture of various 

solutions used in electron 
microscopy . The waste is 
regularly disposed of by the 
EHS. 

The spill occurred when a 
laboratory worker accidental-
ly tipped the glass bottle off the 
counter, breaking it on the 
floor . The employee immedi-
ately left the scene and 
contacted the police depart-
ment. 

Osmium tetraoxide, also 
known as osmic acid, 
evaporates rapidly and the 
fumes can cause serious 
damage to the mucous 
membranes of the mouth, nose 
and eyes. It has no neutrali-
zing agents, and can penetrate 
the skin if touched. 

All furniture, floors and 
other items in room 1509 are 
now considered contaminated, 
though decisions on their 
fI;lture are still pending. 
,. It was unknown how much 
osmium tetraoxide and 
glutaraldehyde were in the 
waste disposal bottle, though 
the concentration does not 
have to be high to endanger 
human life. 

Some confusion resulted in 
the evacuation causing a few 
employees to leave personal 
belongings in the building.

out." Critics call Moon's 
movement "a cult", based on 
certain criteria . These 
critieria include a living leader 
who claims a unique spiritual 
position, a written manifesto 
about where the world is 
headed, wide variations in life-
style for the the mem bers, an 
isolation from friends, family, 
and career goals, and a 
recruitment process mid of 
any critical evaluation of the 
central tenets. 

Rabbi Miller explains, 
"CARP is deceptive in its 

• public statements and in 
dealing with individuals 
privately." Calling it a "clever 
ploy" by CARP to counter the 
cult charges with cries of 
religious intolerance and 
persecution, Miller remarks, 
"If it is necessary to be totally 
cut off from the rest of the 
world (when joining the 
Unification Church), it's 
inappropriate. If the belief are 
strong enough, you don't need 
to be cut off." 

" That's ridiculous," 
answered Haycroft. "We're 
not a cu It." He explained, 
"We're not just out to recruit, 
we've got goals. We want the 
world to be a place of peace." 
Haycroft also claimed that 
when opponents learn the 
"depth of the theology", they 
lay aside their claims. Calling 
deprogramming "a disgusting 
practice", the CARP rr.gional 
advisor attacked people for 
making money out of 
"kidnapping peop,le and 
breaking their faith . ' 

Meanwhile, Holmes accoun· 
ted for the CARP endorsement 
of AS presidential candidate, 
Dave Toliner. Holmes said, 
"He's a nice guy. He helped us 
out on our budget requests .. .! 
wanted to support someone -
I wanted to get into politics." 
When asked if he thought the 
unofficial endorsement was at 
all irresponsible, Holmes 
replied, "I have no regrets. The 
,>chool made its own problems, 
with its own rules. I just did 
something very simple."

Finance committee moving to,vard nelV fees 
By HENRY SCHULMAN 

s.cr.-.to CorTe ......... 
The Senate Finance Com-

mittee took the first concrete 
step to set student fees for the 
1982-83 academic year last 
week, approving a $200 

increase Gov. Brown proposed 
over this year's level. 

The $1,194 annual UC fee 
was part of a compromise ham-
mered out during extensive 
negotiations - ending just

tee's 11-1 vote - between UC, 
Californiis State University, 
legislative and student 
representatives. 

Other parts of the comprom-
ise include: 

-a $416 annual fee for CSU 
students, representing a $94 
increase over this year and a 
$60 increase over Gov. 
Brown's suggestion; 

-a $5.7 million allocation 
for increased financial aid to 
cover the higher CSU costs; 

-adoption of a permanent 
formula to set student fees. 

The proposal could be 

altered substantially in 
further budget negotiations. 
but all the parties involved 
said the bi-partisan support 
the measure received Satur-
day will help it through the 
process. . 

All of the representatIves 
involved in the negotiations 
preceding the measure's oas-

'sage also indicated they 
favored it. 

UC student lobbyist Mark 
Litchman called last week's 
vote a "cosmetic victory" since 
UC students will still have to 
pay an additional $200 next 

year. The Board of Regents 
endorsed the $1,194 fee last 
February fearing the legisla-
ture would enact an even 
hi~her increase. 

'Given some of the propos-
als thrown out by ltlP,slators 
this is a big victory, , Litch· 
man added. "I think we could 
have looked at $1,500 in fees ." 

Litchman also lauded the 
fact financial aid will be 
increased commensurate with 
the new fee increase.

tee adopted would allow the

CAPE facing cuts Genetic research law to 
prontote safer laboratories Due to' the budget cutting 

efforts of Legislative 
Analyst Tom Ham. the 
Course and Professor 
Evaluation (CAPE) may not 
receive their entire $56,000 
budget next year. 

Presently CAPE is short 
$20,000 needed to produce 
next year's publication, and 
staff members of CAPE feel 
the deficit may be serious to 
it's printing. 

"Realistically, any long 
term setback would prevent 
CAPE from providing 
service to UCSD as a 
whole," Dave Blyth, a 
CAPE spokesman said. 

ASUCSD President 
Henry Chu has offered to 
aid CAPE. However, the 
possibility of the ASUCSD 
footing the entire $20,000 
deficit seems unlikely_ 

Meanwhile, se.veral 
strategies have been 
suggested to help CAPE

which would seek funds 
from administrative 
sources - was decided 
against for fear that 
administrative funding 
would make CAPE lose its 
autonomous status. 

Another strategy, how-
ever, seems more feasible: 
increase advertisir.g rates 
and increase the cost per 
issue of the publication. 

And, in the meantime, 
staff members of CAPE 
have been circulating 
petitions in order to bring 
their budget difficulties to 
the attention of the UC 
Re((ents and the state 
legtslators. . 

"Although our immediate 
concern is to publish the 
book this summer with the 
current school year's 
collected data, the panic 
about shortage of money 
means that CAPE does not 
receive permanent fun-
ding," CAPE director 
Heatherbell Fong said.

the only agency affected, 
however. 

University officials main· 
tain the school's own safety 
standards are already more 
rigid than the National Insti-
tute of Health's and the uni-
versity therefore doesn't 
oppose that part of the pro-
posed legislation. 

UC lobbyist Steve Arditti 
said, however, the university 
takes issue with an unusual 
section in the measure placing 
the burden of proof on the uni-
versity that lab safety stand-
ards were maintained, instead 
of on the paintiffs, in civil or 
criminal suits. 
• "It will increase the tempta-
tion for litigation," Arditti 
maintained, "with experts 
coming in saying anything 
done in the lab was inapprop-
riate." He added he could not 
recall the university ever 
being sued for damages in a 
recombinant DNA case.

He added the Berkeley cam-
pus already boasts safety 
standards tougher than the 
National Institute of Health's. 
Any recombinant DNA experi-
ment requires approval of two 
faculty committees, and labor-
atory procedures such as isola-
tion and proper ventilation are 
monitored, he said_ 

Instances have been 
reported of a UCLA professor 
losing federal grant money, 
and a UCSD researcher losing 

his job, because they both 
failed to meet their campuses' 
DNA research safety stan-
dards Nevertheless, Assemb-
Iymember Tom Bate s 
(D·Oakland), a co-sponsor of 
the bill , praised the measure 
and said, "it is extremely 
important that we make sure 
communities act to take ade-
quate protection in doing 
genetic research experi-
ments." 

The ways and means com-
mittee spent little time debat-
ing the bill last week. The lack 
of a quorum caused the 
research bill's lack of votes, 
but committee Chair John Vas-
concellos (D-San Jose), prom-
ised he would allow members 
entering late to vote on the 
proposal. 

the initial vote was 11-0 
with bi-partisan support, indi- . 
cating the bill might have little 
trouble passing the full 
Assembly.

removes it ever further from 
the realms of our daily 
experience. Unless we acquire 
understanding," he said, "we 
will remain where we are right 
now, at the mercy of experts-
or worse, of charlatans posing 
as experts." 

Saxon said the problem we 
need to address "is our 
inability to distinguish 
between sense and nonsense 
when it comes to matters 
connected with science and 
technology. Liberal education 
is a failed idea as long as our 
students are shut out, or only 
superficially acquainted with, 
knowledge of the kinds of 
questions science can answer 
and those it cannot." 

Saxon asked: "Why do so 
many educated, intelligent, 
inquisitive people believe in 
such things as UFOs, 
psychics, ESP, precognition, 
psychoki nesis, astrology, 

biorhythm , and pyramid 
power?" 

The answer, he stated, is 
because of "a grave mispercep-
tion of the laws that govern 
our universe - and a grave 
failure of our educational 
system." 

Saxon pointed out that 
"teaching science to liberal 
arts students is something I 
have always taken seriously, 
from the moment I began 
teaching physics more than 35 
years ago. And I know just 
how hard it is, having tried to 
do it myself on many 
occasions.. . and having been 
responsible for a failed 
textbook on the subject ." 

Saxon suggested designing a 
course of study "to help 
students understand the 
nature of physical laws, what 
they are and what they are not; 
what they can tell us about the 
physical world and what they

8 The UCSD Guardiaa ThUnday, June 3, 1982 

'Fair? hike in student fees proposed 
continued from p.:1lle 6 
Legislature to set UC fees at 40 
to 50 percent of the average 
cost of educating a student, 
estimated next year at $3,000. 
Under that formula UC fees 
could be set next year between 

$1,200 and $1,500. 
The compromise fee plan 

was agreed upon after exten· 
sive negotiations Wednesday 
night and Thursday afternoon 
of last week in Sen. Alan Siero-· 
ty's office. The Democrat from 

Los Angeles took the offensive 
in seeking "n Clgreement after 
a finance committee hearing at 
which several fee levels were 
proposed, but none agreed 
upon. 

Sieroty credited the univer-
sities, the s tudent lobbies and 
legislative staff members with 
reaching the consensus on 
next year's fees. He admitted 
other obligations prevented 
him from taking part in most 

of the negotiations. 
"The figures here don 't 

come from me, but from repre-
sentatives of the schools them-
selves," he said. 

The compromise fee levels 
represent a victory for Sieroty, 
who Wednesday objected to a 
proposed $1 ,250 UC fee as too 
burdensome to the s tudents. 
Sieroty advocated narrowing 
the gap between UC and CSU 
charges . 

Although CSU students will 
have to pay more than Brown 
proposed while UC students 
won't CSU 10bbyistJimJensen 
called the plan "fair," when 
historically lower CSU fee lev-
els are considered.

The tot<ll fee increases 
would net the state $23 million

jected revenue shortfall in

billion. 

Saxon advocates a blend of 
liberal arts with science

cannot; how they are arrived 
at; and in what sense they are 

J true." 
The course of study should 

also "provide some grounding 
in the laws of probability and 
chance, and thus some 
understanding that in a world 
as complex as ours, both 
statistical fluctuations and the 
accidental coincidence of 
unrelated events happen all 
the time," Saxon said. 

"Third, it should convey the 
important idea that science is 
not a collection of isolated 
facts but a highly unified and 
consistent view of the world. 
We also need to make 

c1ear ... why it is that scientists 
can make with reasonable 
confidence assert ions that 
seem to ignore anecdotal 
evidence that so many others 
find persuasive. Our students 
should be able to understand 
why physicists accept 
relativity and not precogni-
tion, or why they accept the 
likelihood of extraterrestrial 
intelligence and the over-
whelming unlikelihood of 
UFOs , why they regard 
attempts to describe the first 
three minutes of the universe 
as sense and not nonsense," he 
said. 

"I have no doubt that it is 
possible to convey to students 
both the power and the limits 

of general scientific laws and 
why we can, in the light of 
both, draw reliable conclu-
sions from those laws ... . 

"The ability to distinguish 
sense from nonsense is an 
indispensable aspect of a 
liberal education; ... in a 
technological society, science 
is an indispensable part of the 
liberal arts curriculum," 
Saxon concll.lded.

Keeping on top of how 
long products stay fresh 

Sperm bank gets first dividend 

Have you ever wondered 
what the date stamped on food 
cartons, cans and packageS 
really means? Most major 
su{>pliers of food products are 
printing dates on food 
P,3ckages. This process, called 
'open dating," means that the 

supplier or manufacturer is 
prmting the "sell by" date or 
"use by" date. 

To control the quality of 
refrigerated and perishable 
products, a "sell by" date is 
stamped on the package. If the 
product is not sold by the date 
stamped, it is supposed to be 
removed from the shelf or 
refrigerated case. "Sell by" 
dates are determined for each 
product so that there will be 
added time for the consumer to 
purchase the product and be 
assured of freshness with 
proper handling and storing at 
home. 

For bakery products, the 
date stamped on the label is a· 
"sell by" date. A half day after 
the printed date, the product is 
normally to be sold at a 
reduced price. Dairy and deli 
products will normally not be 
sold after the date printed on 
the package. But most kinds of 
these products are supposed to 
be fresh for 5 to 7 days after 
purchase if refrigerated. 

For dairy and deli products, 
the period of time these items 
maintain their quality after 
the " sell by" date varies 
according to the product and 
home refrigeration. However, 
here are some genenl 
guidelines to use:

The freshness life refers to 
the number of days past the 
last day of sale stamped on 
package. 

Freshness and weight of 
fresh meats is insured also 
with a "sell by" date. Fresh 
meat should be used as 
soon as possible after 
purchase. Roasts, steaks, 
chicken and fish should be 
cooked within 3-5 days . 
Ground meat should be cooked 
within 24 hours, unless frozen. 
Frozen meats are best used 
within 2-4 weeks. 

Suppliers are also printing 
"use by" dates of packages and 
cans. This type of dating 
means that the product is 
better if used by the date 
stamped. Since canned items 
often retain their quality for 
years, this date might be more 
than a year from the purchase 
date. If canned goods are 
stored properly, most will last 
over a 2-3 year period. The 
"use by" date also offers the 
consumer a guideline for 
rotating stored products. 

Food dating can be a useful 
~ide for the consumer. The 
'sell by" date or "use by" date 

mean only that this is the last 
day the product should be sold 
and that this date is set to 
allow for freshness during 
normal home usage or shelf 
life at home. A "sell by" or 
"use by" date does not mean 
that a product will be 
un accepta ble or un usa ble after 
the printed date. Food dating is 
a guide to insure that the 
product will be used at its best. 

By ANNE McKEE 
Robert Clark Graham, 

founder of an Escondido-based 
sperm bank has announced 
the birth of the first baby 
conceived of "bank" sperm. 
Graham claims his sperm 
bank stocks the "seed" of 
Nobel laureates and high 
achievers, and he asserts that 
women artificially insemina-
ted with this sperm will 
produce "a few more creative 
intelligent people who 
otherwise might not be born." 

As gifted children are 
.generally prized in our society 
(and especially in academic 
communities), Graham, an. 
optometrist who made his first 
fortune in shatter-proof 
lenses, may make his second in 
the production of "wiz 
babies." The marketing of 
"genius sperm" is sure to 
create a furor over the 
morality of attempting to 
breed humans selectively. 
Before hopeful parents of 

. prodigies-to·be begin "ban-
king" on Graham's sperm, a 
few fundamentals of the 
inheritance of intelligence 
should be understood. 
. Many studies have shown 
that performance on standard 
I.Q. tests (the commonly used, 
though controversial method 
of testing intelligence) is 
correlated with many 
environmental factors such as 
diet, family size, and socio-
economic class . Programs 
such as HEAD START have 
shown that sensory stimula-
ting environment s can 
improve the intelligence 
performance of ghet to children 
s ignificantly . Thus in telli-
gence as our culture defines it, 
is not solely determined by 
inheritance but also by 
environmental fa c tor s. 
Neither it is "fixed ," but to 
some extent is changed 
through experience. 

The genetics of intelligence 
is not well understood , but 
ca mmon consensus is that ·a

performance. Because of the 
numbers of genes which seem 
to be involved it is presumed 
that these genes reside on 
different chromosomes. It is 
known that people with 
chromosomal deletions 
(chromosomes which have 
parts missing) often have 
greatly lowered intellectual 
capacities. Conversely , 
carriers of a particular extra 
segment suffer from Down's 
syndrome - a condition which 
produces physical abnormali· 
ties and lowered intellectual 
capacity . The genetic 
component of intelligence 
seems to be a complex 
interplay of many factors such 
as multiple genes and the 
possession of whole, unfrag· 
mented chromosomes. 

When purchasing the semen 
of a Nobel laureate, prospec· 
tive parents should realize 
that the sperm of the 
illustrious father which will 
ultimately fer t ilize the 
mother's egg does not contain 
100 percent of the father 's 
genes - and one sperm will 
carry only 50 percent of the 
father 's genes for intellectual 
endowment. 

Each individual has two 
genes for each trait. These 
genes may be identical or 
alternative forms of the gene. 
For any trait one gene is 
inherited from the mother and 
the other gene is inherited 
from the father - t hus the 
mother's egg and father 's 
sperm each contain only half 
of the respect ive paren ts 
genes. As a result of the 
process of sexual reproduction 
the tot al assor tment of genes 
that was the genetic bas is for 

the father's intellect cannot be 
the same assortment of genes 
that will contribute to the 
baby's intellect. 

"Aha!" many mothers-to-be 
think smugly, "What of the 
case when the mother also is 
endowed with a superior 
intellect?" Well unfortunately 
even if the woman insemina-
ted is a genius a baby genius 
cannot be guaranteed. It is 
generally observed that when 
two parents with extreme 
traits (a genius' intellect is an 
rxtreme train within the range 
of human intellec tual 
capacity), t heir offspring show 
a regress ion back towards the 
mean of that trait for the 
population. Thus from two 
genius parents chances are 
high that an offs pring of less 
superior intelligence will be 
born. This effect is again a 
result of the random way in 
which t he genes for the trait 
are assorted into the egg and 
sperm during sexual repro-
duction , and gene interaction 
in the expression of the trai t. 

Parents investing in this 
venture s hould be aware that 
because of the manner in 
which the character of 
intelligence is inherited such a 
scheme cannot guarantee a 
genius baby although it should 
increase the probability of 
producing a bright child. As 
Graham himself is reported to 
have s a id, " Probably the 
children of such people might 
not achieve in t he same field as 
their parents but it is likely 
they would have more on t he 
average to offer to society in 
their own time, in their own 
w ay."

Proton storage ring 
at Los Alamos 

The Proton Storage Ring 
(PSR) is a major new addition 
to the high current medium 
enerp proton linear accelera-
tor (LAMPF) at the Los Alamos 
National Laboratory. Aut~ 
rized at $19 miJIion and 
scheduled for first operation in 
early 1985, the PSR will be 
used to accumulate large 
numbers of protons from the 
accelerator and deliver them to 
a neutron generating target at 
the existing Weapons Neutron 
Research (WNR) facility in 
very intense short pulses 
whose duration and frequency 
ideally match the needs of the 
experimental neutron physics 
program. The project, which is 
being designed and implemen-
ted by the Laboratory's 
Accelerator Technology 
Division, will make the WNR 
facility the most powerful 
laboratory pulsed neutron 
source available anywhere, 
over a very broad neutron 
energy range. 

The linear accelerator 
produces the world's most 
intense proton beam (a n 
average current of 600 
microamperes 4000 trillion 
protons/second) at an energy 
of 800 MeV (million-electron-
volts). This beam is primarily 
used to generate intense !luxes 
of secondary particles 
(neut rons, pi-mesons, etc. ) 
which are employed in a wide 
range of basic nuclear 
research and practical 
applications. 

The inherent power of 
LAMPF as a neutron source 

driver is very large, since each 
800 MeV proton produces lo. 
20 neutrons by nuclear 
fragmentation (spallation) 
when it passes through a thick 
target of a heavy (high atomic 
weight) material such as 
Tantalum or Uranium. 
Furthermore. the neutron 
spectrum (energy distribution) 
is very broad, ranging from 
several hundred MeV down to 
100 keV (ki\(}.e1ectron-volts). 
With hydrogen-rich material, 
such as polyethylene, wrapped 
around the target, many of the 
primary neutrons can be 
slowed down (by repeated 
inelastic collisions) to the 
thermal ran~e, where their 
energies are SImilar to those of 
atoms in bulk matter. At the 
high energy end of the 
spectrum, the neutrons are 
used for nuclear measure-
ments, some of which have 
application to weapons design; 
at the low energy end, the 
neutrons are used to study 
properties of materials_ 

To make best useof such an 
intense and broad spectrum 
neutron source it is necessary 
to provide the flux in the form 
of short pulses, rather than a 
continu()us stream. Experi· 
menter need to discriminate 
neutron according to energy 
as they arrive at their sample, 
and this can only be 
accomplished with sufficient 
precision by using time·of· 
flight (TOF) techniques, 
namely by measuring the time 
interval for a neutron of a 

The UCSD Guardian 

given energy to traverse the 
distance from generating 
target to the experiment. To 
minimize the timin, or 
clocking uncertainty It is 
necessary that the neutrons be 
generated in pulses whose 
lengths are short compared 
with characteristic flight 
times. 

The PSR acts as an 

accumulator, converting long 
proton pulses (100-750 
microseconds) from the 
accelerator, which would be 
unsuitable for driving the 
neutron source. into appropri-
ately short very intense 
bursts, without losing protons 
in the process. It provides the 
crucial time reordering of the 
accelerator's output proton

current into the form ideal for 
driving the pulsed neutron 
source. In so doing it will make 
available pulsed neutron 
intensities at the Los Alamos 
WNR facility of unprecedented 
magnitude and will open new 
doors to neutron research in 
both nuclear physics and 
materials research using 
neutron scattering.

Famous jazz pianist McShann

Legendary jazz pianist and 
band leader jay McShann, a 
major catalyst in the creation 
of the Kansas City style of 
jazz, is scheduled to serve as a 
Regents ' Lecturer at UCSD.

by the Black Performing Arts 
Program and the Deprtment of 
Music. 

McShann, regarded by 
many as "the world's greatest 
blues pianist," will be on the 
UCSD campus today and

of the Mandeville Center . 
McShann is credited as one 

of the developers of a style of 
early big band music which 
revolutionized not only the 
genre of jazz, but all of Ameri-
r.an music. The music repres-
ented a synthesis of the New 
Orleans style, blues, boogie-
woogie, and spawned the earli-
est seeds of bebop. McShann's 
ability as a band leader helped 
him discover and present the 
next generatIOn ot jazz lumi· 
naries, most notably Charlie 
"Bird" Parker. 

McShann now represents 
the last living link with a for-
mative period in the develop-
ment of black - American 
culture. His career serves as 
an indicator of an extremely 
significant era which revolved 

around Negro migration north· 
ward and the Pendergast 
machine which abetted the 
growth of jazz in Kansas City. 

The Last of tM Blue Devils 
tells the story of the music that 
came from this era. Many of 
the major jazz innovators of 
the day had their roots in Kan-
sas City including Count 
Basie, Lester Young, Buster 
Smith, Eddie Durham, Big joe 
Turner and Jay McShann. 
Many of these great musicians 
returned 40 years later to the 
Old Union Hall in Kansas City. 
The film captures this reunion 
and tells their story through 
their words and music 
interspersed by rare vintage 
material of many of them.

12 The UCSD Guardian Thlll'1lday, Jane 3, 1982 

=======The 1982 Empty Beer Can Awards======== 
Time definitely flys around here, 

doesn't it? I mean it just seemed like 
yesterday that the guys from 
Chocolate City were teeing it up in 
their first football game of the year. 
And now it's June already and it's 
time for our annual EBCAs. Where 
in the heck did the year go' 

Well, one thing's for sure. Some 
stuff definitely went down in 1M 
sports in 81·82. Let's be honest. 
Intramural Sports at UCSD has 
become a rollercoaster out of 
control. More players, more teams, 
more sports, more leagues and more 
memorable moments than you can 
shake a stick at. Spills, thrills, 
plenty of agony, a little bit of 
ecstacy, and hopefully for most of 
you ... a whole lot of fun . 

The fun's winding down now as 
the sun sets on another banner 
year, but we can't close the door 
before recapitulating some of those 
memorable moments just one more 
time. 

Aah yes .. . the annual EBCAs ... the 
Empty Beer Can Awards, . for you 
newcomers. A brief stroll down 
memory lane ... capsulizing just a 
few of the many , many 
contributions and non-contribu-
tions to 1M sports in the grand 01' 
year of 1982. 

Henrietta_ .. the envelopes, please. 

Best Athletic Performance in a 
Individual Sport ... Craig Kreeger

Basketball Supershot competition 
which propelled him to an 
out tanding mark of 6064 points 
and the Super tars individual title.

Best Athletic Performance in a 
Team Sport .. Janice Yip (GYST, 
Bush League ) ... this little 
firecracker cleaned house in the 
Coed Intramural program this 
year... her teams wept the big 
three in football (East Cupcake 

tate), basketball (G YST), and 
probably softball (Fobo), making 
her a rare member of UCSD's elite 
Triple Crown Club. Additionally, 
her women's softball team (Bush 
League) is right there in the th ick of 
things this week in the 1M Softball 
Play-offs. 

Best Intramural Career ... Hal 
Jacobs (White Punks, I Don't Care, 
Deltas) ... no doubt about it ... the Red 
Rapper knows what he's doing 
when it comes to sports ... he won 
every volleyball doubles tourna-
ment he ever entered at the U in the 
last 5 years (at least 10 or 11 or 
'em) ... and then finished with J 
flourish in the team sports program 
with championships in Men's AAA 
bru..ketball (I Don't Care), Coed AAA 
Volleyball (Deltas), and Team 
Badminton (Deltas) .. .1 wonder if 
this guy ever went to class? 

Intramural Team of the 
Year ... the guys from Chocolate 
City ... Will McDaniel , Dexter 
McMichael , Chris Washington and 
the rest...this group had it together 
in 1981·82. They waltzed through 
Triple-A football, came from behind 
to pull out another championship in 
5-10 ba ketball (U nquestionable), 
and did the same number in track 
and field (CC T.C.). And they did it 
the 1M way the whole time ... lots of 
fun, lots of class. 

Adolph Hitler Memorial Award 
(for dominance in athletics) ... 
the team of Foul Play/Foul Destiny 
that pulverized all comers in this 
year's innertube waterpolo 
program ... Bloss, Delong, Sturdi-
vant, Davis, Martinez ... you name 
the best 7 players in the game and 
they probably had 5 or 6 of 
them ... their winning streak in Coed 
AA play was stretched to 32 
straight this year. 

Mismatch of the Year 
Award ... to anyone that had to 
guard Big Ed Martinez (Foul Play) 
in innertube waterpolo ... trying to 
stop Eddie was like trying to stop an 
aircraft carrier with a flotilla of 
rowboats. 

Most Impressive UCSD 1M 
Records Set in 1982 ... 11.00 100 
Meters by Robert Hoffman (Choc. 
City Track Club) at the Track & 
Field Games; 6064 points by Craig 
Kreeger (Superstars Competition); 
450 points of a possible 500 in the 
Racquet Sports Pentathlon by Rick 
Frey; 25.06 50 Butterfly by Chris 
Glass (Med School) and 59.86 100 
Backstroke by Alan Cintas (Revelle) 
at the 1M Swimming Champion-
ships. 

Most Unique Athletic Skills .. _ 
Tim Wilkinson (Sombre Reptiles) ... 
all Tim was talented in the oddest 
possible combination ... he starred 
as a goal-proof nettender for 
Somber Reptiles in Men's Floor 
Hockey ... tied for the championship 
in the 1M Golf Tournament...and 
polished off a strange triple crown 
by winning the Coed A Team 
Badminton champion sh ip last 

week. I wonder if he can play ping-
pong with his feet? 

Best Athletic Director ... Todd 
Stayarl (TKE) ... in his best "Bear" 
Bryant imitation, tactful Todd has 
carefully orchestrated a growing 
phenomena at UCSD .. .fraternity 
athletics . His boys have been right 
up there with the best of them in 
most sports ... particularly 
Hawaiian Football and Men's A 
Basketball, where both times they 
got nosed out at the wire. The 
question is ... can he win one for a 
change? 

Worst Case of Cheating in 
IMs ... Chuck Gormley .. .in the 1M 
Golf Tournament ... teed up every 
ball even if it was in the fairway 
(which it rarely was) .. .Iost 13 golf 
balls, didn't take one penalty 
stroke ... and then cockily put down 
a score of 115 on his card and said, 
"Hey, I played pretty good today!" 
(Ed. Note: Gormley was three-time 
defending champ of the Peroetual 
Hammerhack Award presented 

_ each year to the worst golfer in the 
tourney_) 

Most Injury-Prone Athlete ... 
Claude Monken (NYOTH) ... Claude 
in one of the few athletes in modern 
times that doesn't know how to 
play in pain. He led the league in 
bruised fingernails and sprained 
earlobes and finished a close second 
in pulled baby toe muscles. Too bad 
for. Claude. Winning the Triple 
Crown would have assured him 
lucrative endorse ment s with 
Johnson & Johnson and Benny's 
Bunion Remover. 

Best 1M Psych-Job ... Profoathl~ 
tics over Biohazards in 1M 
Softball ... no matter how good the 
'Hazards seem to be each year, they 
just never seem to get up for the 
Profos. George Stein brenner would 
do wonders for this group ... time to 
clean house, fellas! 
Longest Softball Hitter ... Kevin 
Long (naturally) (Hill Street 
Blues) ... nobody jerked them out 
more regularly than the big fella 
from Nevada ... set an all·time 1M 
record by homering at least once in 
every game that he played. 
Shortest Softball Hitter ... Mike 
Lo (naturally) (Question Marks) ... 
little Mikey hit a lot of deep drives to 
the catcher this year. 
Don Juan on Campus Award ... 
Alan Freidman (Unspoken 
Intentions) ... nobody has more girl s 
waiting by the phone then this 
guy ... but the Budman is having a 
heckuva time trying to figure out 
why. It certainly can 't be his 
hands ._. he's scarred every 
volleyball that the department 
owns this year. It must be his 
baseball c1eats ... easily the niftiest 
on campus. I wonder if he wears 
them on dates, too? 
Best Use of a Commercial 
Product by an 1M Athlete ... Ari-
anne Neumark (Dolphins) for 
Dolfin shorts ... il Arianne can get 
her girls to squeeze out one mort: 
victory in the Women 's A Volleyball 
final s, you'll see every woman at 
UCSD next year wearing maroon 
Dolfin s horts to class. 
The John Forsyth Award (for 
building a dynasty in intramur· 
al sports) ... Deltas (Volleyball ), 

Foul Play/ Destiny (Waterpolo), 
Profoathletics (Softball), GYST 
(Basketball). 
Forsythe Jr. Award (dynasty 
teams of the future in 1M 
sports) ... Plain Wrap Prophylac-
tics (Foo tball), TKE (ugh! -
everything), and the Megacrushers 
(Volley ball). 
Longest 1M Game of the 
Year ... Los Supremex and Last 
Chance battled it for the AAA 
Soccer Championship from March 
until May ... over two months ... with 
Los Supremex finally winning 2-1 
on an inadvertant goal kicked by a 
Last Chance player past his own 
goaltender. 
Most Exciting Championship 
Game ... the Hula Bowl in Hawaiian 
Football...the game between 
Pakalolo and Tau Kappa Epsilon 
was a rubbernecker's delight . 7~ 
68! .. _with Pakalolo winning at the 
wire on an interception in the end 
zone. 

Best 1M Team Names ... Bowling 
For Arabs (Softball), Natalie Wood 
Swim Club (Waterpolo) 
Xorst 1M Team Names. .. Butt-

wart and Babies in a Blender 
(Volleyball) 
Best Goosebumper in 1M 
Sports .. .}eriene Evans (Flying 
Fangs) .. Jeriene easily broke her 
own UCSD record this spring with 
more goosebumps produced than 
any other 1M athlete. Her 
secret? .. easy. Always come to 
school in shorts on any day that is 
rainy, windy or cold. And if it ever 
gets below 32 degrees, always wear 
your bathing suit to class.

The UCSD Guardian 

Spor~Shor~ ____________ _ 

Bottoms Up 
Although you may think so, this 

year's Intramural Sports program 
has not come to you by accident. 
Hours and hours of planning, 
orga ni zationa and expert 
supervision have all gone into 
making UCSD's 1M program what 
it has become ... a leader in its field . 
And a lion's share of the credit for 
making it all happen thould go to 
the hard-working, friendly "six-
pack" that helps run our program. 

Without these six students, 
freely giving of their time, effort 
and input, UCSD Intramurals 
would be much less than it already 
is. So when you see these guys 
hanging out in their favorite 
watering hole after another 
"tough" day at the office, buy them 
a tall cold one. Noone deserves your 
thanks more than they do. 

In order of seniority, thefabulous 
"SIX·PAC((" of Intramural Sports 
notoriety are: 
Dan Eby, Revelle Senior ... Mr. 
Waterpolo at UCSD ... coach, player, 
referee, tournament director ... you 
name it, Dan has done it all ... a 
charter member of the Loud 
Athletic Club on campus ... Loud 
team members are known lor their 
quiet ambience and conduct at 
athletic contests and intramural 
games ... Dan is best known, 
perhaps , for his easy-going 
temperment during competition 
and has the amazing ability to keep 
his cool and act nonchalant after 
st riking out with the bases loaded 
in a tight ball game. 

Kevin Gunning , Revelle 
Senior ... Pushy team captain of 
G YST coed basketball team that 
marched to two consecutive titles. 
The first , last. and only Music 
major ever to be employed by 1M 
sports ... he had the annoying habit 
of s inging to players after he threw 
them out of a game. A good 
saxophone player with extraordin· 
ary lung capacity, Kevin was used 
almost exclusively by the 1M Dept 
this quarter to blow up innertubes 
for waterpolo games ... at which he 
got plenty of practice. Also known 
for his contradictory athletic 
ski IIs ... he can pass a volleyball 
perfectly, but not a basketball. 
Likewise, he can throw a football, 
but his softball throws more often 
than not wound up somewhere out 
of play. Basically a happy guy, but 
athletically a real weird one. 

Jon Lindo, Muir Senior .. . popular 
team captain of Godzilla vs. 
Gidget...people are still trying to 
figure out which one he resembles . 
A very charitable sort of guy .. Jon 
contribute$ regularly to his favorite 
charity .. . the Santa Anita race 
track ... Used to know a lot about the 
ponies but since his choice in the 
Derby finished well back, he has 
decided to concentrate more keenly 
on his studies at UCSD. A computer 
whiz, Jon is solely to blame for your 
team not being ranked in the 
weekly 1M Bud Poll. 

Tim Sullivan, Muir Senior ... the 
1M Dept 's version of Casper the 
Ghost...Tim had a disappearing act 
you wouldn't believe. In fact , 
during the fall, he disappeared for 
an entire quarter and wasn't 
missed ... Has been known to like a 
good cocktail every now and 
then ... mostly now . Always a 
popular bartender at staff 
parties ... Tim has been slow to 
realize that that i basically why he 
wa hired. Only some excellent late 
innning relief work by hisgirlfnend 
has kept Tim's name from being 
placed on the list of recently 
missi ng referees. 
Fred Blesch, Muir Senior ... 
UCSD 's version of Bruce Jenner. .. 
Fred like to do it all intramurally ... 
all the time. Played and excelled in 
every 1M sport offered except 
basketball...No wonder ... he was 
last seen in the Main Gym trying to 
kick the ball into the goal. Although 
his teams usually did well, Fred 
never enjoyed the sweet aroma of 
victory until recently when 
Pakalolo smoked thier way into the 
Hula Bowl. And I do mean smoked. 
Kim Duclo, Muir Junior (6th 
year) .. .father-protector of all 
women on campus and off .. _Kim is 
the consummate perfectionist. 
Most of this can be attributed to his 
boyhood role models ... AJ. Foyt, 
Bobby Orr, Stanley Kubrick, and 
Scott Berndes. Never one to worry 
about anything, anyone, or 
anybody, Kim has masterfully 
orchestrated a life style that keeps 
him busy 27 hours a day. Having 
fiOlally over·achieved in his one true 
sport (floor hockey), Kim has 
branched out this quarter in his 
attempt to master another activity. 
This time it's volleyball and except 
for his team name (Muff the Tragic 
Faggot), Kim as is his custom is 
doing all the right things .

SODle big stars and big thrills 
frOnt the studios this SUDlDler 

By CL YDENE NEE 
Summer is a time when the 

studios bring out their big 
entertainment films, and this 
summer will be no exception. 
A udiences across the nation will 
be able to choosefrom almost 50 film tilles. While all of Ihese 
films won 'I be major box office 
smashes, a good nu m ber of Ihem 
will draw monstrous lines this 
summer. Here are a few of the 
best films for summer 1982. 
Star Trek II - The Wrath of 
Kahn - The media coverage of 
this film prior to its release has 
probably been the most 
extensive in film history. The 
question which will draw the 
audience to come see fhe film 
is: Does Spock die in the film? 
Those of us who grew up with 
this cultural hero will be 
interested to find out his fate. 
In The Wrath of Kahn there are 
many special effects done by 
the George Lucas company 
Industrial Light and Magic. 
which will attract a large 
audience. 

look for long lines outside this 
film during the summer. It 
opens tomorrow night. 

E. T. - Exira Terrestria/ -
Is Steven Spielbergl's fanciful 
tale about an alien visitor to 
earth, and his unique 
relationship with a 100year·old 
boy. It is Spielberg's hE'st film 
to date, and it will be the 
largest box office draw of the 
summer. Like Poltergeist and 
The Wrath of Kahn, the special 
effects were done by Industrial 

Light and Magic (lLM), which 
looks like it will be a common 
factor in all of the biggest 
blockbuster films of the 
summer. 

Blode Runner - a futuristic 
detective drama starring 
Harrison Ford, the star of 
Raiders of the Lost Ark and Star 
Wars. It is directed by Ridley 
Scott, who directed previous 
summer box office smash 
Alien. It is loosely based on a

the audience. 

Anyone who has seen 
Dragonslayer will believe 
that dragons are real. This 
is primarily due to the 
wizardry of the special 
effects people at the 
Lucasfilms Ltd. subsidiary 
Industrial Light and Magic 
(ILM). (See story on 
summer films.) 

Coordinating the special 
effects work was Oscar 
winning BrianJohnson, and 
Dennis Muren, along with 
100 other technicians who 
created some of the most 
s pectacular scenes ever put 
on film. 

15 

Poltergeist - Written and 
executively produced by 
Steven Spielberg, and directed 
by Tobe Hooper will no doubt 
do well with audiences . It will 
be released by the recently 
merged MGM and United 
Artist studios. It is a tale of the 
supernatural, that has been 
shrouded with the typical 
secrecy that surrounds all of 
Spielberg films. Those who 
have seen it say that it is the 
best horror film that has ever 
been made. So we should all 

UEO's Friday Night 
Flicks series concludes this 
week with the big scale 
adventure film Dragonsla-
yer. Dragons/ayer is set in 
sixth century Britain. 
Urlich (Sir Ralph Richard-
son), the last sorcerer on 
earth, prepares to do battle 
with Verminthrax Perjora-
tive, the last of an evil breed 
of enormous flying, fire-
breathing creatures known 
a dra~ons. Enter the 
sorcerer s apprentice Galen 
(Peter MacNicol) and 
Valerian (Caitlin Clarke) 
who try to carry out the 
quest of destroying the 
dragon, after circumstances 
prevent Ulrich from doing 
it. The ending is truly one of 
the most spectacular scenes 
ever filmed, and the twist of 
fate at the end will amaze 

Dragons/oyer will be 
shown Friday night in 
Mandeville at 8 p.m . 
Tickets are $1.75 at the Box 
Office. For information call 
452-4559. Among the big relea8e8 this summer are, 'Poltergeist' (top) a modem ghost 8tOry and 'Blade Runner' a futuristic adventure.

am working on my next 
in s tallation Th e Onion 
Universe and one of my main 
projects is to onionize Lalolla. 

Wi th our modern technology 
and emphasis on speed and 
slickness instead of human 
needs. we often end up with 
isolation and sterility. This 
happens in our living areas 
and even worse in our 
shopping centers. Nature with 
its friendly smell and warmth 
disappear, and instead, cold 
technology arises. Will the 
human beings survive 
mentally and physically? 

Onions mean unity and 
smell rather than isolation and 
sterility. That is why I work 
with onions in my art. The 
s trength of the onion was 
valued so highly that the 
people building the pyramids 
in Egypt were paid in onions.

We will consider applications of linear 
algebra to a variety of subjects including 
economics, physics, ecology, genetics, and 
we will write computer programs in OASIC 
or FORTRAN to solve problems from these 
fields. For example, we will srudy rwo linear 
models for economic systems and use 
resulrs about nonnegative matrices to find 
equilibrium price structures and outputs 
necessary to satisfy demand. As another 
example, we will use a matrix model of 
population growth to study the sustainable 
harvesting of an animal population. \Ve 
will also approximate the solution of the 
heat equation on the computer.

for an 
address 

There is no way to verify 
whether the invitations are 
lost in the mail or were never 
written in the first place. But 
it looks as though, once again, 
we won't deliver a commence· 
ment address to a single Class 
of 1982. 

Happily, no one loses under 
this recurring arrangement. 
While graduates won't have to 
pretend to listen to us, we 
won't have to disguise 
ourselves as wise elders. We 
were, of course, sad to hear 
that Illinois Eureka College 
opted for alumnus Ronald 
Reagan instead of us (although 
hearing the president speak on 
arms control is a little like

The Guardian picks the best 

Athlete of the Year 
By BOB McSPADDEN 

Special to the G ..... dian 
After tyin(t for first place in 

1979, the Trtton basketballers 
had a losing record for two 
successive years, but made it 
to the playoffs in 1982. 

The team lost its forwards 
this year (Mark Barreca and 
Michael Barney) to the rigors 
of academics, but managed 
very well with center Mike 
Dabasinskas and forwards 
Mike Maross and Kevin FJait{. 
Coach John Block saw hIS 
career coachin~ record fall 
even further in 82, but for the 
first time floored a squad that 
he had put together, and he 
clearly learned a great deal 
about coaching in the process. 
Finally the UCSD Tritons 
gloried in having perhaps the 
finest player ever to 
participate at the intercollegi· 
ate level in the person of 
Tommy Wight, this year's 
Guardia11 athlete of the year. 

To be given this honor, it is 
expected that the individual 
excel beyond all others. He 
must be a team player while at 
all times realizing that 
possibly his own skills may 
just be the deciding factor in a 
contest, and not be modest in 
using them. He must perform 
consistently at all times, for 
the team may rely heavily on 
his efforts. He must sacrifice 
himself, and at times perform 
incredibly. He must be a 
leader, a person that fellow 
players look up to. He must at 
all times give everything he 
has in order to win . And he 
must, amid all of this athletic 
prowess, be respected off the 
playing arena. No need to look 
any further, we found our 
athlete. 

During the 1982 season, 
Tom Wight broke the all·time 
coring record at UCSD, a 

mark which had been set and 
put on the shelf in 1970 by 
Brian Todd. Make no mistake 
about it, Wight could have 
toppled that etching much 
earlier in the season, save for 
the fact that he is very modest 
in his hooting, a fact which. 
may be trou blesome down the 
line. 

"He's got to be aggressive 
with the ball at all times. He 
has to take charge of the court 
as a guard and make the 
defense respect his shooting." 

Nine·year NBA veteran Stu 
Lantz said that about Wight 
after a practice session with 

the 6'4" blond haired g1lard 
two weeks ago, a session 
whi~h has been repeated lately 
dUring off hours in the main 
gymnasium. But back to the 
season. 

On the meter of consistency 
Wight would rate a ten. H~ 
was always ready to play, 
(guard Bob Goodman and 
Wight started more games 
than anyone for the Tritons 
this year) and always ready to 
practice. At one point during 
the year Block commented. 
"He works harder and harde; 
every time he hits the floor. He 
really wants to play ball." 

A leader before the 1981-82 
lineup, Block sat in his office 
smiling at the team roster. The 
team hadn't even played a 
game yet, but Block knew his 
court judge would be a key to 
t he Tritons' success. After two 
games Block commented, "It's 
very obvious that when 
Tommy has a good night we 
are in much better shape. He 
takes control of the game and 
the players take after him. 
Even though he's got to learn 
to shoot the open shot more, he 
knows the court and his 
limitations. " 

And perhaps the final mark 

The Most

Guardian honors for UCSD 
sp('lrts Most Inspirational 
Player go to softball's Vanessa 
Davis. On what has to be UC's 
most inspirational team, 
where everyone gave 100 
percent to the final inning, 
Davis did everything; playing 
all positions except third base 
and leading the club in batting 
average at .338. triples with 
six, walks and runs batted in. 
She placed second to Kathy 
Clasby in runs scored with 14. 

Davis was the team's spark 
plug and a leader in keeping 
spirits high with exciting 
ofiensive and defensive play, 
as well as her antics and 
pepper on the sidelines. 

"In two years on any 
Division Three team, I have 
never seen a more complete 
athlete," coach Dan Monte-

of a remarkable athlete is that 
one aspect called personality. 
Wight is not what the average 
sports reporter deems the 
easiest guy to get a story from. 
But on this count, let me make 
it very clear. At no time 
throughout Wight's one year 
enrollment here has he ever 
shied away from an interview. 
After games he is probably the 
most willing to talk on the 
team. But the conversation, no 
matter how hard one tries to 
point i. in the direction of Tom 
Wight, always ends up 
describing the other guys' 
performance." The team 
really played well tonight. 
Bobby really was hot with the 
passes." End quote, enough 
said, nothing about Tommy 
Wight. Well, you get the 
picture. 

Tom Wight will graduate 
this year, having completed 
his four years of college 
eligibility, and the obvious 
question is where will he go? 
The campus overlooking the 
Pacific Ocean breakers does 
not get the recognition of such 
institutions that produce the 
Ralph Sampsons and AI 
Worthys of recent college 
notice, but Coach Block has a 
few cards in his pocket left 
over from his own NBA days. 
Can Wight make the 
transition? 

Lantz .offered a few 
comments. "The transition is 
as much mental as it is 
physical. The college player 
w.ho all throughout his 
lifetime has been the team star 
must adjust to not being the 
best player on the team for the 
first time in many years. He 
must fight for a position on the 
roster. And sometimes he 
must be willing to ride the 
bench. Tommy has the ability 
to play pro ball ifhe'sgiven the 
chance. He has been working 
hard on his moves and 
shooting and is refining some 
of his skills. I think he could 
make it." 

Catching up with Wight a 
few days back, on the way to a 
class, I asked him what he 
thought about his chances of 
making a pro team. He was 
walking with Goodman, a 
long·time friend, and neither 
seemed at all surprised about 
the next step Wight would 
possibly take. 

"Are you ready?" 
"I'm going to have to be." 
Best of luck, Mr. Wight.

P.E. coach John Cates and members of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity constructed the new 
fitness course by hand. 

Fitness course opens on Friday 
By PHIL LAUDER 

taft Writer 
The grand opening and 

dedication ceremony for the 
UCSD fitness trail will be held 
this Friday , June 4. at 1 p.m. 
The fitness trail is a mile and a 
half jogging route containing 
20 exercise station , and i 
located in the woods north of 
Central Library. 

A crowd of a hundred or 
more, incluuing the trail's 
designer and builder, PE coach 
John Cates, is expected. The 
ceremony will be held at the 
beginning of the trail, at the 
corner of John Hopkins and 
Service Roads.

three stations are used for 
warm-up, the last three for 
cool·down, and the stations in 
between are for intensive 
cardia vascular exercise. 

After doing the activities at

the 220 yards to the next sta·

there. In this way, heorshede-

run with 440 yards between 
each station. 

Construction of this trail 
has been in progress all 
quarter long, and has involved 
a tremendous amount of effort 
on the part of Cates and 
members of the Phi Delta 
Theta fraternity. 

Cates solicited and received 
$8000 worth of grants toward 
the construction of the project. 
Not covered in the grant, 
however, was money for labor, 
which Cates had planned on 
providing himself.

UCSD wins surfing 
By ELANA ROSEN 

Staff Writes 
Strolling down the winding 

path toward the Lowenbrau 
Classic ... 

Black's beach: breeding 
some of the best breakers in 
the country, and inevitably, 
some of the top surfers from 
UCSD. was the site of this 
weekend's surfing competi-
tion. 

Surfing during their home 
break, the UCSD team -
familiar with "their" elements 
- dominated the weekend 
with their superior perfor-
mance. _ 

Although Orange Coast 
College proved to be highly 
competitive. UCSD held the 
lead during the entire contest, 
taking first place with 119 
points. 

Following in second and 
third place respectively were 
OCC's A and B teams. 

San Diego State placed 
fourth, Saddleback College 
fifth, and the UCSD B team 
placed sixth. 

The contest conditions were 
not "glassy." The medium on-
shore winds created some-

New course 
continued from page 20 

With ten weeks of effort, 
including the sacrifice of many 
weekends, the group cleared 
the course, built the exercise 
stations, filled 90, two-foot 
holes with concrete to set the 
posts in. and finally got the 
.whole thing built. 

This was Cates' second 
effort at constructing the 
parcour. Eight years ago, with 
no grant and no fraternity 
members to help, he set out to 
make the course. With help 
from track coach Andy Skief, 
he prepared the lengthy course 
and constructed all the 
stations out of dead tree limbs. 
The effort took them six 
months, "and was probably 
the first of its kind in the 
country," says Cates. After 
two weeks in operation, 
though, vandals "reduced it to 
firewood ." 

This second fitness trail 
should meet a better fate, and 
better usage. "We expect (that) 
100 to 300 people a day will be 
using it," says Cates. "We've 
designed it to be in a peaceful 
and natural setting. Anyone 
who would like to be amorig 
the first to try it this Friday 
should find it worthwhile." 

what bumpy conditions. 
Black's consistently powerful 
and good sized waves gave the 
state's top surfers an 
opportunity to exhibit their 
skills. i.e. shred and rip gnarly 
tubes. (Sorry, couldn't resist.) 

Outstanding individual 
performances came from Pete 
Curry, a freshman from 
Hawaii, who placed first in the 
men's division and Steve 
Colton, a senior from Santa 
Cruz. who finished third in the 
same final (both UCSD 
students took first in their 
preliminary heats). 

Jetting through waves on his 
knees was Billy Lerner (one of 
the top knee-boarders in the 
country) in the Knee-Board 
Division. The women's 
division resulted in Isabelle 
Fried as third place winner, 
Sandy Gross in fifth and 
Monica Armstrong in sixth 
place. 

The combination ofUCSD's 
victory, good tunes provided 
by KROQ, and finally the 
emergence of the sun, created 
not merely a sports spectacu-
lar but an overall memorable 
weekend. 

Davis is

can hIt, run, throw aud play 
any position as we saw this 
year. She has great leadership 
ability; she's everything a 
coach could want as a 
complete softball player." 

Davis, a sophomore, 
attended USC one semester on 
a track scholarship before 
Monteverde enticed her to 
UCSD, persuading her, as he 
put it, to become one of the 
"founding mothers" of a 
women's softball program. 
5he starred last year as 
catcher on UC's winning club 
and was voted the team's Most 
[nspirational Player. This 
year, she started as catcher 
but wound up playing 
wherever needed as the 
number of Tritons dwindled 
throughout the season. 

The final game saw her 
come in at first base to play on 
an ankle she had injured the 
day before in a play at the 
plate. 

She was voted the team's 
Most Valuable Player this 
season.

the eucalyptus grove near 
Mandeville Center, in ight of 
de Saint Phalle's "Sun God." 

Irwin will then return in the 
Fall and will participate in dia-
logues with students and the 
public. 

The first purchased piece of 
work, H.C. Westermann's 
(1925-1981) "They Couldn't 
Put Humpty-Dumpty Back 
Together Again" (a wooden 
sculpture assem bled addi-
tively, the theme of which is a 
fated X-O game), was recently 
installed in the Central 
Library. 

The UCSD Sculpture Col-
lection is beginning, and not 
only the campus. and San 
Diego, but 10 time it is hoped, 
the world , will it as a major 
collection of contemporary 
sculpture. 

"It IS very exci tmg to be part 
of somet hi ng that '5 going to be 
the ~t collection of its kind 
anywhere," ays Beebe. "It's 
an extraordinary project." 

Roughwear has an important 
pointer for the social· 
conscious seniors bound for 
the Big Apple: "Say, 'see you 
later, alligator' if you want to 
be noticed on Madison Avenue 
next year." Lauren is 
particularly suitable fOr 
Western colleges in dusty 
settings. Note: Client insists on 
caps and gowns. 

Robert Young - Known to 
many as Marcus Welby, M.D., 
this popular father figure 
examines the neuroses of an 
unemployable clas . Excerpt: 
"Hey now, why are my 
favorite kids so jittery all the 
time?" Guaranteed to calm 
nerves. especially parent '. 
Coffee reception will follow. 

Mariel Hemingway - The 
flexible actres , in a peech 
entitled "A Farewell To 
Dorms," suggests that college 
athletes and drama students 
hold the key to getting 
America back on the fast 
track. A riveting perfor-
mance" - The New Yorker. 

Lenny Skutnik - Casting 
aside his noted disdain of the 
media, the Air Florida crash 
hero advises striving 
celebrities that a little fame 
means a lot of misery. Agent's 
note: Skutnik requires time-
and-a-half should he unexpec-
tedly find himself in a double 
bill with First Lady Nancy 
Reagan. 

Orlando Jose Tardencilla 
Espinoza - Recounting his 
own experience as a double-
eros, mg informant for the US 
State Departm ent , the 
Nicaraguan has some timely 

tip~ tvr :.tudents contempla-
ting careers in the Foreign 
Service. Hold all questions 
about communist subversion 
in El Salvador, please. 

The Go-Go's - Currently 
topping the rock·and-roll 
charts with their album, 
"Beauty and the Beat," the 
queens of college she-sheness 
explain how one doesn't need 
to be a musical genius to set 
trends and make a mint before

Pretty Neat." Fee: $8.99 Ii t ,

The NBC Peacock - In an 
address entitled "Bird Like 
U ," this colorful animal 
predict that network 
counterpart will, having 
cancelled America's favorite 
sitcoms, cook their own geese. 
Fee: better seeds for the 
Nielsens. 

Of course, we don't expect a 
flood of contracts in next 
week's mail. (This is just as 
well. Most of our wished-for 
clients will have nothing to do 
with us.) 

But if colleges and 
universities were more 
sensitive to the average 
graduate's disdain , for 
academics and politicians, 
they might choose their 
graduation speakers more 
creatively. As is, too many 
school allow their well-
appointed speakers to use the 
platform to make headlines or 
intone hollow truisms that 
have little meaning 24 hours 
later. A stodgy peaker may be 
well known , but he or she can 
make for an awful few hours.
