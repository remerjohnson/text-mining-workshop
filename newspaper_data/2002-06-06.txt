Graduating seniors suit up Administration 
retries Koala Students excited, worried about 

what future holds 
By BRENT HECHT 
Staff Writer 

As graduating seniors stand in 
line this week to rent traditional 
caps and gowns, one thing is 
clear: The UCSD graduating 
class of 2002 will need more than 
the artificia l flattOp afforded by 
their ceremonial attire to main-
tain balance after their lives are 
turned upside-down after gradu-
ation .

chances of being found not respon-
sible in front of the board . Robert 
Forouzandeh, the student advocate 
general for Tbe Koall/ , ca lled the 
university's case "weak" and 
referred to the charges as a "com-
plete fabrication ." 

A1though smiles in the line 
certainly outnumber worried 
frowns, a definite aura of insecu-
rity lingers among cap-and 
gown-renters.

The cam pus judicial board 
convened yestcrda y to hea r the 
UCSD administration's second 
attempt to prosecute The Karl" for 
aalegedly disturbing a MOVIlliento 
Estudiantil Chicana/o de Aztlan 
meeting Nov. 19, 200 I. The hear -
ing follows the administration 's 
nullification of earlier proceed-
ings held May 22. 

Prio r to the meeting, ,nelllbers 
of the Guardiall and the Nightcop 
presented their objections to the 
hearing being closed, but ultimate-
ly left after their motions went on 
the record, allowing the heari ng to 
proceed . 

" I e,\pect that we will be found 
innocent of all charges when the 
whole ca e is presented and the evi -
dence is out there," Forouzandeh 
said. 

According to Forollz3ndeh, the 
Koala's evidence II1di cated that the 
photographer, who allegedly di -
rupted MEChA officer Erncsto 
Martinez whil e he spoke at an 
o rganization meeting, is not a 
member of the humor publication 
and was not asked to attend o r 

The most apprehensive were 
those eying the job market after 
four or more years of education. 

"You know how everyone has a 
going-to-sleep ritual, like brush-
ing your teeth? Well mine was 
sending out resumes," said 

Stephanie 1 g of Thurgood 
Marshall College.

perated after sending out over 500 
resumes in the last year. 

"Nobody's hiring right now," 
she said.

A.S. Council tells 
Watson: IBeer Me' 
Student government passes resolution 
in favor of beer gardens on campus 
By LAURA McGANN 
Staff Writer 

In an effort to raise school spirit 
and draw older students to campus 
events, the A.S. Council passed a 
resolution last night calling for the 
university to allow beer gardens in 
regulated environments. 

"We are encouraging the free-
dom to hold a beer garden," said 
Jeremy Gallagher, A.S. commis-
sioner of services and enterprises 
and co-author of the resolution. 

Beer gardens have become a 
heated issue between university 
administration and students. This 
year, Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Joseph Watson has officiaJly 
prohibited two university-spon-
sored events from having beer gar-
dens, including the winter quarter 
basketball game against UC Davis 
and Muirstock, despite student 
support. 

"We see it as an issue of: This 
is legal, it can be done, it is done 
all over the place, why is it even an 
issue," Gallagher said. "If YOll are 
of age, if there is proper security, 
proper measures taken, following 
all regulations - federal , state, 
campus, why can't we do it?" 

The resolution calls for UCSD 
administration, facuJty and students 
to make every attempt to allow a 
beer garden if held in a safe and 

responsible manner. To facilitate 
this, Gallagher hopes to create a 
written agreement with the univer-
sity that will set standards for stu-
dents to follow. 

"Right now we are meeting with 
Dr. Watson to talk to him about 
what steps we need to take to 
enable students to have a beer gar-
den - to have a written criteria 
that we can follow," Gallagher said. 

"We want something written 
that students can follow so that the 
option is available to students." 

Currently, only Revelle College 
Council has passed a similar resolu-
tion in support of beer gardens. 
Gallagher said that he would like to 
see other college councils do the 
same. 

Supporters of beer gardens 
believe that the gardens have the 
ability to draw a more diverse 
crowd to campus events. 

"There is very little doubt that 
beer gardens are a very good way of 
attracting transfer students, com-
muter students and students who 
are over 21," said A.S. Vice 
President Internal Kevin Hsu. "It's 
just about expanding the range of 
possibiJities that there are." 

This summer, Gallagher 
intends to work on making beer 
gardens an option for students, 

See IEEI. Pille A3 

looking forward to further edu-
ca tion say they may find more 
stabi li ty. 

"Graduating is scary, but stay-
ing in school and not having to go 
on the job market yet is a relief,"

BRIEFLY 
UCSD Libraries receive grant for digital media 

The AndreIN W. Mellon Foundation has donated 
$850,000 in grants to UCSD Libraries to support 
strategic digital media initiatives. For the next two 
years, the Mellon Foundation will fund the archiving 
of art images and their arrangement in digital format 
for educational use. 

The initiatives call for the construction of a pro-
totype Union Catalog of Art Images, which will 
consolidate approximately 500,000 metadata 
records describing art and images. 

UCSD Libraries are teaming up with Harvard 
Universi ty's Fine Arts Library and the Ingalls library 
at the Cleveland Museum of Art to develop the 
UCAI program. 

UCSD and its partners aim to approach the tech-
nical issues related to the comple)( cataloging func-
tions of unifying and displaying the diverse range of 
content to be found within the catalog. 

Along with the funding for the UCAI prototype, 
the Mellon Foundation donation will also enable 
UCSD Libraries to digitize its slide collection, which 
will be added to the ArtSTOR collections available to 
UCSD faculty and students. 

Regents name Anastasio new 
diredor of LLNL 

The UC Board of Regents named Dr. Michael R. 
Anastasio director of the UC-managed Lawrence 
Livermore National Laboratory, replacing departing C 
Bruce Tarler as head of the UC-managed nuclear 
security laboratory. 

Anastasio, who currently serves as LLN~s 
deputy director for strategic operations, was rec-
ommended by UC President Richard C Atkinson 
during a special meeting of the regents which was 
conducted via telephone conference call. 

Atkinson's recommendation came after a con-
siderable amount of consulting from a panel com-
prised of regents, research scientists and research 
administrators. The panel was advised by leaders 
from LLNL and various UC campuses. 

The newly appointed director has served at LLNL 
for 22 years, where he has climbed the ranks from 
physicist to division leader to developer for the 
Stockpile StelNardship Program, and last year, to 
deputy director. 

Anastasio has also served as a scientifIC adviser at 
the U.S. Department of Energy, where he consulted 
with senior department members on several SSP 
issues. 

He received the DOE Weapons Recognition of 
Excellence Award for technical leadership in nuclear 
design in 1990. 

As director, Anastasio will control LlNt:s 7,500 
employees and S 1.5 billion budget. He will begin his

ERe wins Student Foundation's 
annual fundraising drive 

The UCSD Student Foundation announced that 
Eleanor Roosevelt College donated more money 
than any other undergraduate college in the 2002 
edition of UCSDSF's annual Change-For-(hange 
Drive. 

In its second year of existence, the campaign 
generated a total of $1,016. The money will be used 
to subsidize the costs of maintenance and new 
equipment at the Intem(!tional Cooperative Nursery 
School in the Intemational Center. 

ICNS was chosen by UCSDSF because of the 
school's philosophy to include and educate a diverse 
student body, ICNS is also burdened by desperate 
finandal need because its status as a co-op hinders 
its funding intake. 

ERe. Which indudes donors from the residential 
halls, Pepeer canyon Apartments and Intemational 
House, Y'IlIl be formally recognized by UCSDSF for 
winning the competition. 

Ha~ of the sum donated to the school was pro-
vided by the UCSD Alumni Association, which 
pledged to match UCSDSF's amount

UCLA study shows racial 
imbalance in prime time TV 

Blacks remain overrepresented in situation 
comedies while other ethnic groups continue to be 
underrepresented, according to a UCLA study titled 
·Prime Time in Black and lMlite: Making Sense of 
the 2001 Fall Season." 

The large numbers of blacks on television tend-
ed to appear largely on Monday and Sunday nights, 
which accounted for 40 percent of all black charac-
ters during the 2001 season. 

The study further showed that latinos represent-
ed two percent of all prime time television charac-

. telS, while making up 12.5 percent of the national 
population. 

Asian Americans comprised three percent of 
prime-time characters, and Native Americans made 
up zero percent 

The study was based on an analysis of the con-
tent of 224 episodes of 85 fictional series during 
October and November of 2001. The networkS 
induded in the UCLA study were ABC, CBS, NBC, 
FOX, UPN and the WB. 

The research is an introduction to a five-year 
study on blacks in prime time television.

A.S. seeks to alter student bylaws 
Resolution is response to Koala controversy 
By LAURA McGANN 
Staff Writer 

In respo nse to the UCSD 
admini stration 's nullification of 
the May 22 all-campus judicial 
board hearing agai nst The KOllla, 
the A.S. Council passed a resolu-
tion June 5 that call s for the cre-
ation of an oversigh t committee 
to decide upon any future allega-
tions of procedural violation by 
the judicial board. 

T he resolution also moves to 
create a judicial policy committee 
to review and revise the current 
U CSD Studen t Code of 
Conduct. 

Both new bodies were pro-
posed .largely in response to the 
A.S . Council's concern about the 
ambiguous language of the 
Student Code of Conduct. 

"The problem with the con-
duct code is there is such vague 
wording, " said A.S. 
Commissioner of 
Communications Navneet 
Grewal. "Just because the admin-

istration has one interpretation 
and the j-board has another, who's 
to say that the administration has 
the right answer?" 

The May n hearing was nulli-
fied last week by Director of 
Student Policies and Judicial 
Affairs Nicholas S. Aguilar, who 
alleged that the judicial board 
failed to comply with Student 
Conduct Code sections 
n. 17. 16.16a-b when members of 
the campus media attended the 
proceedings. 

While the administration cur-
ren tly decides on any discrepan-
cies in the Student Code of 
Conduct, the oversight commit-
tee would be comprised of both 
students and administrators with 
students in the majority to collec-
tively decide on any such situa-
tions. 

"[The: A.S. Council I wants to 
set up some kind of procedural 
oversight that is made up of stu-
dents and administrators so we all 
have a say," Grewal said. "Because 
if we don't have that, who is to

The resolution also calls for a 
reform of the Student Code of 
Conduct, which was drafted over 
20 years ago. As the code now 
stands, it does nO! meet the same 
standard as state and federal law. 
Proponents clai m me propuseu 
judicial policy committee would 
revi se and review the Student 
Conduct Code in order to clear 
up points of contention. 

"My hope is that the review of 
the code will lessen the ambigui-
ties th~ t are currently in the 
Student Conduct Code, therefore 
making proceedings more fair for 
students," said A.S. President J en 
Brown. 

The A.S. Council hopes that 
in making tllis statement, it will 
become me first step in achieving 
change. 

"Yes, this is just words," said 
A.S . Vice President Intern al 
Kevin H Sll . "But at the same time, 
it's giving us the ability to take 
action."

PROPS & FLOPS 
Props to Sun God nudity - can we 
have more next year' Ladies, don't be 
shy about getting in on the act. 

Flops ro the administration for Tbe Koala D-
hearing shenanigans. Apparently, students 
are actually getting fewer rights. 

Props to the amazing voter turnout dur-
ing the A.S . elections - over 27 percent 
of students put down textbooks and 
turned off "Counter-Strike" to vote. 

Flops to the lack of beer gardens this Ii 
1 -year. We want to entice students into 

coming to on-campus events ... without 
alcohol? 

Props to increased campus discussion of 
free speech issues in the wake of 
Thr Koala controversy this year. Even if 
we don't all agree, at leas t we're think-
ing. For once. 

Flops to next year's 10-minute passing Ii-
periods. At least remembering class 
ti mes is easier now: 9:30, 11 :00, 12:30 .... 

Props to Rubio's and Krispy Kreme for 
making mealtimes on campus a little 
tastier. We just hope they're bringing 
more Stairmasters to RIMAe. 

Flops to the "Most" campaign for being Ii 
poorly conceived and darkly suggestive. I -
Are you saying 25 percent of UCSD 
guys think that when a woman says 
"no," she really means "yes"? 

Props to the passage of the athletics fee 
referendum. Now the Guardian doesn't 
have to think of a new section to replace 
sports. 

Flops to the upcoming increases to park-
ing fines. The reason we park illegally is 
because we can't afford a permit, dum-
tnies, let alone more expensive tickets. 

Props to CUCS being open 24 hours as 
finals approach . Now your roommate can 
snore in peace while you cram for exams. 

Flops to the top-down attempt to start a 
riva lry between UCSD and UC Davis. 
Besides, UC Davis is now heading to 
Division I. 

Props to UCSD 's outstanding resea rch 
offerings this year, from the oral vacci-
nation for smallpox to telling us that 
eight hour of sleep may in fact be too 
much. Apparently, screwing undergrad-
uate education til favor of re earch leads 
to some good things.

THURSDAY, JUNE 6, 2002 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Understanding history is crucial 
Students don't appreciate importance of the past 
By WILSON CHEN 
Staff Writer 

A recent study showed that only 
43 percent of U .S. high school stu-
dents have an adequate grasp of the 
history of their own nation for their 
level of education. 

I'm a history major, and I am 
mortified at this. I have studied 
many categories of history and, 
although my greatest interests do 
not lie in U.S. history, I was not in 
high school in the States, either. 
For people not to know the impor-
tant details about the country or 
region they inhabit is a travesty. 

Does anyone recognize how 
important history is? What if the 
Roman general Scipio's parents had 
never met? The military genius 
Hannibal might have defeated 
Rome, the greatest ancient empire 
of them all. 

If Saladin, of the same mold as 
Hannibal, had not been an upright, 
honorable man - a man who once 

return~ King Richard's horse dur-
ing the Fourth Crusade - then 
there would be no doubt about who 
controls Jerusalem today, because 
Saladin was the greatest comman-
der Islam ever enlisted in its ranks. 

Even seemingly little things 
such as Paul Revere's ride have 
changed and altered the course of 
events so drastically that the mod-
ern world as we know it was born 
from their seeds. 

The United States may be only 
some 200 years old, but it already 
has a rich historical background. 
Every ethnicity has its own story to 
tell. This owes much to the way the 
nation was founded : The Spanish 
settled the Southwest, the English 
settled much of the Adantic coast, 
and the French in Louisiana. 

From the Freedom Train to the 
classic debates of Washington and 
Du Bois to the religious fervor of 
the Civil Rights mOYCment in the 
19605 when the names Malcolm and 
Martin meant hope and saving grace 
to blacks, American blacks have 

fought for their place in this nation. 
Should our kids know these things? 
Absolutely. 

Every child of every ethnicity 
should be taught the history of 
America and why the social issues 
and tensions existing today are 
important to our nation's growth. 
Our children cannot make this 
world a better place if they do not 
even know the reason behind peo-
ple's actions. 

Most often you will hear people 
say "history is boring." Perhaps 
they just don't like to read. Epic 
battles, cultural and political 
debates, little people doing big 
things, powerful men and women, 

The low regard of 
history as a worthy 
academic subject is 

revealing of people's 
attitude toward 

learning it: 'Oh, it's just 
history, no big deal.' 

the invention of the wheel and the 
invention of the Intel processor -
what is boring about history? 

I Ioyc to hear stories, and 1 am 
pretty sure most of us grew up lis-
tening to many different t:ales. 
History is mostly about the study of 
events and their causes, but it can be 
quite entertaining. Don't tdI me that 
you did not enjoy your grandmother 
telling you how your clad once fell 
face-first into the toilet, or the time 
he stepped into a pile of doo-doo 
while mesmerized by a pretty neigh-
bor. That's f.unily history for you. 

If you haven't figured it out yet, 
you don't necessarily need a certain 
degree to do certain jobs. Stop 
telling me I should become a 
teacher just because I study history. 
The low regard of history as a wor-
thy academic subject is revealing of 
people's attitude toward learning it: 
~Oh, it's just history, no big deal."

show girls how to do math prob-
lems? "Show me the functions 
baby, show me the functions!" 
How adorable. 

I am not just criticizing the lack 
of appreciation for U.S. history. I 
have taken it to be my right to 
assume that 99 percent of those 
who don't know anything about 
their own country probably do not 
know much about other places 
around the world either. 

It is always a pain to hear people 
say things such as, "Alaska, hmm .. . 
igloos and Eskimos?" Study histo-
ry, for heaven~ sake. Alaska is rich-
er in oil than any other region of 
America, and that says it all . 
Geography says there is oil; history 
tells you how the United States 
claimed it when Russia owned it 
and Canada is the country attached 
to it. 

If you still think knowing histo-
ry will not help you, think about 
this: Aaron Burr and Alexander 
Hamilton squared off in a classic 
duel at the turn of the 19th century. 

Imagine if Hamilton had not 
died from critical wounds. The guy 
created the earliest venion of the 
Federal Reserve Bank! Alan 
Greenspan is a joke compared to 
this guy. H Hamilton had become 
president, how could that have 
influenced politics, economics and 
society as a whole? We will never 
mow, but it is my bet that the 
Great Depression never would 
have occurred. Hamilton's eco-
nomic dreams went ~ar beyond his 
time. A nation's leadership can 
change many things. 

It is significant, even crucial, in 
my eya that people learn their his-
tory so that past mistakes and cata-
strophes will not occur again. After 
all, we are humans, not animals, 
.and learning is what we do best.

Tijuana experience 
sl10uld not shock 
priveleged student 
Editor. 

I must say, I found Ryan 
Darby's article on his Tijuana 
experiences ("A visit to Tijuana 
exposes crooked cops," May 2 8) 
one of the most amusing adven-
tures in pig-headedness I've seen 
in a while. 

A quiclc review of the story: 
Outside a nightclub in one of the 
poorest cities in the continent, 
Darby loses $20 to a flower girl, 
cusses out a bouncer, gets 
punched in the gut and lives to 
tell the story of police brutality 
and the violation of his civil 
rights south of the border. It's 
very funny. 

Darby's talents for humor are 
remarkable: As he explains how 
annoyed he is that this girl has 
stolen $18, he remarks, "I work 
hard for my money." Clearly any 
stupid flower girl - who earns

her enti re livelihood (and possi-
bly that of a family?) in destitute 
po verty, $2 at a time, sell ing roses 
ro inebriated American teenagers 
during the small hours o f the 
night - cannot appreciate the 
con~pt ~ 
"hard work." The life of a 
Guardian staff writer is, I must 
concede, a bit more harrowing, 
especially when police brutality is 
involved. 

Police brutality! This is 
hilarious. A country in which an 
unarmed citizen can be riddled 
with bullets 42 times by police, a 
country in which an entire 
police district can be decimated 
by scandals of planting evi -
dence, abusing confiscated 
drugs and brutally beating sus-
pects - and a country in which, 
while all this goes on around 
him, a middle-class white male 
from La Jolla can get hit in the 
stomach by a nightclub security 
guard (whom he just called a 
"fucker") and call it police bru-
tality - I say that any country 
in which all of this can happen is 
truly, as Darby puts it, "so 
great." 

Let this wordsmith's jokes be a 
solemn reminder that those "civil 
rights" that we enjoy and flaunt 
as young college students are 
really privileges that the majority 
of people in this world can't even 
comprehend. It is a privilege to 
insult policemen and get away 
with it, a privilege to live by 
Lockian tenets, a privilege to 
sreak up when the state steals 
from you, and, above all, it is a 
fantastic luxury to say, "It wasn't 
about the money; it was, and still 
is, the principle." 

Principles are the grand com-
modity of the well-off. Most peo-
ple in this world can't afford prin-
ciples; indeed, even Americans 
must pay a steep price, since they 
close their minds and deaden 
their hearts to the intense pover-
ty of a nation but a short drive 
south of campus. 

Some say a liberal is just a 
conservative who hasn 't been 
mugged, and others say that a

But let not such dismal

Ground religious 
article in religious 
understanding 
Editor. 

I would like to comment on 
imone Santini 's article, "Morals 
hould not come from religions 

alone" (May 28). 
I love it when atheists explain 

religion to everybody. They make it 
so imple that even a scientist could 
understand. It is especially enter-
taining to read an attempt to take 
down the big "religion system" in 
the hopes of a happier, more logical 
world. A fair example is given with 
Santini's article. 

I read the article. While I found 
myself consistently needi!lg my 
dictionary, it was interesting to see 
culTUral evolution as the explana-
tion for all morality in an anthro-
pological tone. 

I n other words, basic laws such 
as murder and incest arose for the 
survival of the tribe and nation. 

. ~,- .. L.' 4"",,,",,, ~ ; oheck·· 

Because we are just like animals, we 
adapt to our ecosystem. Whatever 
works best ends up developing as a 
moral code, right? This is the 
explanation I've been looking for! 
Now I can leave my church, take up 
fornication and whatever works 
best for me will become my morals, 
right? . 

r apologize, Mr. Senior Staff 
Writer, bur my life is not as shal-
low as my pockets or this argu-
ment. 

Every human being is more 
important than we could ever 
imagine. Each of us carries the 
capability of self-knowledge, of 
self-possession and of freely giving 
ourselves to other persons. It is 
unique that we can question our 
very existence. It adds up to make 
us the most important animal on 
this Earth (sorry, dog lovers). 

Authentic morals should pre-
serve the respect and dignity of the 
very important human species. 
How much do you respect your 
neighbor? Enough not to kill him? 
Great. Enough not to steal or cheat 
him' Even better. Enough to for-
give him? Wait, you sound like a 
religious sort. 

The truth is, you don't have to 
be religious to share in many of the 
morals held by world religions. You 
just have to know your own worth 
and that of others. From here all 
authentic morals can be derived 
(see the last seven commandments 
as an arbitrary example). 

I admit I believe in God and that 
religious STUff. But I would prefer 
that religion stay our of moral 
debate. If you want to talk morals, 
let's talk philosophy. If you want to 
talk religion, first you need to prac-
tice it.

New proposal seeks to modify "One.-.rate" 
Students could gain more control over meal points 
By MARGARET O'NEILL 
Senior Staff Writer 

A proposal aiming to malce res-
idents partially exempt from the 
financial mandates of the "One-
rate" plan was postponed for dis-
cussion by the Housing and 
Dining Advisory Comminee on 
Monday. The newest proposal 
aims to allow residents to withdraw 
38 percent of their meal points to 
make food purchases elsewhere. 

After an earlier proposal sub-
mitted on May 20 to exempt 
International House residents 
was rejected by the committee, 
A.S. representative to the 
Housing and Dining Advisory 
Committee Josh Whornnan sub-
mitted the proposa l, hoping to 
deter the controversial plan that 
obligates all on-campus residents

"It is an honor to present the 
prize dedicated to my father'~ 
interest to our most respected tele-
vision man, Walter Cronkite," said 
award presenter Nico Nierenberg, 
who is the son of former SIO 
director William A. Nierenberg. 

Cronkite has been affiliated 
with CBS News since 1950, when 
he anchored the "CBS Evening 
News" until his 1981 retirement. 
From 1952 to 1981 , he covered 
the national political conventions 

to pay for a meal plan. 
"I'd like to see a mandatory 

meal plan phased out, but if that 
is not an option, this proposal or 
a program similar is the minimal 
accommodation necessary to 
meet the needs of students," 
Wortman said. 

The proposal was tabled by 
the committee until next year on 
the grounds that it was "unclear," 
according to Whortman. 

"1 don't thinlc there's anything 
I could have done that would 
have changed their minds," 
Wortman said. 

Another member of the com-
mittee said that the proposal 
came too late for implementation 
next year, because the budget for 
H&DS was already approved and 
sent to the Office of the 
President. 

and elections. Cronkite is particu-
larly remembered for his cover-
age of the U.S. space program. 

According to Cronkite, he has 
been passionate about science, 
the oceans and space exploration 
since he was young. 

"I just love sailing," he said. 
"And I do believe the ocean is a 
frontier that we should continue to 
explore without overexploiting it" 

In pursuing his love of the 
environment, he hosted CBS' 
summer science series, "Walter 
Cronkite's Universe," in 1982; 
co-produced "Why in the World" 
in 1981 for the Public 
Broadcasting System; and hosted 
the 1991 series "Dinosaur" for 
Arts and Entertainment Cable 
Television. 

Wortman argues that the din-
ing hall facilities do not accom-
modate all dietary needs, such as 
strict Kosher, vegan or vegetari-
an, organic, high-protein, low-fat 
and Hallal. He said he believes 
this plan would alIow students 
more flexibility in their dining 
options. 

He modeled his proposition 
after one ·at UC Berkeley, where 
students can use meal swipes to 
buy merchandise at a 38-cents-
per-dollar rate at a convenience 
mart-type establishment. 

Under the proposal, the 
remaining 61 percent would still 
be in control of H&DS to pay 
overhead costs. 

Wortman said he felt the need 
to author such a proposal after 
the bid to exempt I-House resi-
dents was defeated. 

He lives in I-House this year 
- it is his first year living on 
campus and he has never had a 
meal plan. 

In an e-mail to Wortman, 
Director of Housing and Dining 
Services Mark Cunningham 
expressed his opposition to 
Wortman's proposal. 
Cunningham argued that there 
would be no way to handle mak-
ing payments to students. 

Cunningham was unavailable 
for comment. 

The committee will look at 
Wortman's proposal when they 
meet next fall . 

"I hope that next year they 
consider looking at this serious-
ly," Wortman said . 

Currently, there is no plan for 
exemption from the mandatory 
meal plan in place for next year.

Worker 
found dead at 
VA Hospital 
Navy veteran 
shot himself in 
parked car 
By BRENT HECHT 
Staff Writer 

A Veterans Affairs San Diego 
Hospital employee allegedly died of 
self-inflicted gunshot wounds in the 
hospital's parking lot last Friday, caus-
ing police to flood the campus and 
block off access to the parking lot. 

The employee, hospital cook George 
Williams, allegedly shot himself in the 
head while sitting in his gray 1995 toyota 
pickup truck. VASDH security found his 
body at approximately 2:30 p.m. 

VASDH is located along Gilman 
Drive, just south of the Eleanor 
Roosevelt College campus. 

After recieving a call about a dead 
body in the VASDH parking lot from 
hospital security, police rushed to thc 
scene. Officers turned around all cars 
trying to enter the lot, causing a minor 
traffic jam on campus. 

"It took us five minutes to (get out 
of the area)," said Shishir Ghia, a Earl 
Warren College sophomore. 

Williams served in the U.S. Navy for 
nine years until 1978, when he began 
working for VASDH. He is survived by 
his wife and their yOWlg daughter. 

"We are saddened by this tragic 
loss and extend our deepest sympa-
thies to [William's) family, friends and 
coworkers," read an internal memo to 
VASDH employees. 

The hospital announced a memor-
ial service for Williams, but has not 
finalized the logistics.

said Marshall's Allison Williams, 
who will be attending UCSD's 
graduate teaching program. 

Muir student Lindsay 
Bircham, who will attend the 
New England School of Law this 
fall, is equally thankful for the 
opportunity for post-graduate 
education, but has worries of her 
own. 

"I will be in debt by the ti~e I 
am out oflaw school," she said. "I 

can look forward to paying $200 a 
month." 

Regardless of concerns about 
job prospects and finances, most 
graduating seniors feel that the 
caps and gowns they are renting 
represent real accomplishment, 
not simply the expected passage 
through yet another phase in 
their quest for success. 

"This is definitely an accom-
plishment," said Ng, Williams 
and upcoming graduate Melissa 
Beckley. 

Cap and gown rentals are 
available at the UCSD Bookstore 
until Sunday, June 16. Rental 
costs are $25.26, plus a $7.74 cer-
emony fee.

UCSD 
Delegates speak 
on democracy, 
terrorism 
By THOMAS A. NULEY 
Staff VltTiter 

United States ambassadors to 
Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, 
Thailand and Vietnam discussed 
democracy, combatting global ter-
rorism and the Southeast-Asian 
economies in a panel hosted by the 
Graduate School of International 
Relations and Pacific Studies on 
Monday evening. 

The ambassadors are touring 
several U.S. cities as a part of the 
tenth arulUaI U.S. ambassadors tour. 
The purpose of the tour is to pro-
mote U.S. interest and investment in 
the ten countries of Southeast Asia. 
About fifty people attended. 

"We believe that more 
Americans need to know about 
what's happening in this ten-coWltty 
region of 500 miUion people," said 
Ernest A. Bower, president of the 
U.S. Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations Business Council and tour 
organizer. 

"It's a reaUy important area for 
the United States. It~ our third-
largest overseas market, but it seems 
that knowledge of the region is not 
on par with what our r~l strategic 
and economic interests are." 

The five countries represented 
on the panel are Brunei , 
Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar 
(Burma) and the Philippines. All 
five members a part of the 
Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations. ASEAN is a multinational 
group that was established to pro-
mote commerce and the interna-
tional trade interests of its mem-
bers. 

U.S.-ASEAN is an American 
group based in Washington, D.C., 
that seeks to promote U.S. business 
interests and investment in the 
ASEAN region. 

Monisha Chandanani, a senior at 
Thurgood Marshall College, fOWld 
the panel informative. 

"I thought it was great," 
Chandanani said. "It gave a good 
perspective about what's going on in 
the area." 

Ralph L. Boyce, the U.S. ambas-
sador to Indonesia, cited examples of 
how democratic conditions are 
improving in Southeast Asia as well 
as the status of efforts working to 
hel p the region recover from the 
financial crisis it suffered during the 
mid -l990s. 

"In this group of ten countries, 
there are widely differing economic· 
and political development models to 
look at," Boyce said. "You clearly 
have a first-world economy like 
Singapore at one extreme and then 
you have Laos at the other extreme, 
which is one of the more underde-
veloped, most slowly developing 
COWl tries in the world." 

Boyce noted that democracy is 
growing even in countries like 
Myanmar. He cited specifically the 
May release of National League of 
Democracy leader and 1991 Nobel 
Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu 
Kyi from house arrest after nearly 
two years of confinement. 

One question from a graduate 
student sought the ambassadors' 
opinions on the escalating India and 
Pakistan dispute over Klshmir. 

"First of all, I think that the con-
flict between India and Pakistan 
would be a disaster for not only 
them but for the region," he said. "In 
terms of a direct effect on Southeast 
Asia, it really depends 0 11 how big 
and how long." 

Another question addressed anti-
American sentiment in the region 
following Sept. II.

"I think right now at this point 
in history it is useful to draw a dis-
tinction between countries that are 
majority Muslim, and those that 
are not," said U.S. Ambassador to 
Malaysia Marie Huhtala, who 
noted that Malaysia is mostly 
Muslim. 

Huhtala also discussed how her 
office has been working to address 
these perceptions Malyasians have of 
U.S. foreign policy. 

"They have the view that we are 
completely biased for no reason 
toward Israel," she said. 

Similarly, the ambassador to 
Indonesia addressed mispercep-
tions Americans have toward 
Indonesia , a country that is mostly 
Muslim. 

In reference to reports in the 
Am~rican n~~s. qledia, he 5f1id jok-

is a rampant, radical Islamic anti-
American state." 

He went on to describe how 
limited the demonstrations were 
and pointed out that the demon-
strations were not about being anti-
American. 

"Frankly, those demonstrations 
that you saw so frequendy [on 1V) 
were reaUy more about Indonesia's 
domestic politics than they were 
about Afghanistan or Sept. II ," 
Boyce said. 

Vanessa Golding, the outgo-
ing president of the IRJPS 
Southeast Asian Student 
Organization, was hoping to hear 
more about economic topics 
re lated to ASEAN. 

"I thin.lc probably due to 9/11, a 
lot of the focus on political and ter-
rori~m Issues seems to be somewhat 
of a trend," she said . "1 don't think 
there was enough time to move 
past that into the more of the busi-
ness and economic issues ." 

The ambassadors are also 
scheduled to visit Los Angeles, 
Seattle, Detroit, New York City 
and Washington, D.C., over the 
course of the two-week tour.

Spukin, out: U.S. ambassadors of Southeast Asia met Monday to discuss 
the region's economic outlook and political future.

At last the Guardian Ad Man has stumped the UCSD movie buffs! Every other week this quarter, he 
had to give up the cash & prizes. Th~ quote was, "You know,' I make a pretty good living selling shit 
like this." Good 01 Navin Johnson, raised a poor black child and struck it rich inventing the 'Opti-Grab'. 
Steve Martin played him? "Alii need is this thermo.s, this matchbox, the chair, and the remote control 
and that's alii need." Any of this ringing a bell? "Random bastard. Die, gas pumper!" Or, "He hates 
those cans!", Or, "I found my special purpose!" Well, you probably weren't even born when The Jerk 
came out. Better luck on finals, Next mystery movie quotes will appear in the 7/15 and 8/12

Ten swimmers have taken .their last dive into a UCSD pool 
Four leave men's swimming and diving team, while six Tritons leave women's 
By ANU KUMAR 
Associate Sports Editor 

Both UCSD men's and women's 
swimming and di vi ng have a hand-
fu l of graduating athletes. The 
men's side wil l be losi ng leadership 
in fo ur swimmers: Pat Carter, 
Christian Deck, Kyle Martin and 
Rob Raffaell i. who have all com-
plcred their UCSD careers. The 
women's team will lose the steadi-
ness and determination of Evelyn 
Kwok, Sandra Lopez, Molly 
McCorkl e, Lindsey Meeks, T ia 
Shimada and Elisa -Ioulson. 

Carter came to the men's team 
during his jwlior year at UCSD and 
he became one of three captains for 
the Tritons this past season. Caner 
swam the I DO-yard butterfly and the 
50-yard freestyle; he was recognized 
by his effort and hard work. 

"He came in with an outstand-
ing work ethic," said UCSD swim-
rl1lng and diving head coach Scott 
J\ lcGihon. "Sometimes he would 
push hirmelf past the point of 

exhaustion, and that pushed every-
one else." 

Deck, who has been a captain 
for the Tritons the past two sea-
sons, proved to be a strong relay 
swimmer. He participated in the 
200-yard medley relay, as well as 
both the 50-yard and 100-yard 
freestyle races. 

"Christian was a great relay 
swimmer," McGihon said. "He was 
one of those guys that we could 
always count on. We knew that if 
he was in the race, we would have a 
good chance of winning it." 

The third captain of the men's 
team was four-year swimmer 
Martin. He swam the 200-yard med-
ley relay with Deck, the lOO-yard 
butterfly and the 200-yard butrerfly. 

"Kyle was a guy that was a sur-
prise swimmer during his freshman 
year, and he not only established 
himself as a great butrerfly swim-
mer on the tcam, but in the confer-
ence as well," McGihon said. 

Another seni or leaving the 
Tritons. Raffaelli, transferred from 

a community college before his 
junior year. He was a steady con-
tributor for UCSD in his event: the 
I ,ODD-yard freestyle. 

"Rob was a bright student who 
had to work through some person-
al adversity," McGihon said. "And 
in the pool, he was one who just put 
his head down and swam as hard as 
he could." 

On the women's side, Kwok, 
who JUSt completed her second year 
as captain, was a strong swimmer 
on the team, but she was also influ-
ential for the younger swimmers. 
Kwok swam the 200-yard medley 
relay, the 50-yard freestyle, the 
I DO-yard butterfly and the 400-
yard freestyle relay. 

"Evelyn had a great presence on 
relays and we always knew she 
would have a big swim in her," 
McGihon ·said. 

Lopez began swimming for the 
Tritons during her sophomore 
year. She peaked in her junior sea-
son when she set three school 
records and two National 

Collegiate Athletic Association 
records. Lopez contributed in the 
1 DO-yard and 200-yard breast-
stroke. 

McGihon said of Lopez: "She 
was a grea t swimmer, hard worker 
and great inspiration for the rest of 
the team." 

McCorkle, who also swam the 
I DO-yard and 200-yard backstroke 
and holds a school record, was a 
determined sWimmer for 
McGihon. 

"She got it in her head that she 
was a great swimmer," McGihon 
said. 

Meeks was also a steady swim-
mer and managed to motivate her 
teammates. She participated in the 
I DO-yard and 200-yard breaststroke 
and reached the finals at the end of 
each of her seasons in at least one 
of her events. 

"Lindsey was a very, very steady 
breaststroker," McGihon said. "She 
was dedicated and did not hesita te 
to push others into swimming 
harder." 

Shimada came to the women's 
swim team after spending four 
years on UCSD crew. Injuries hin-
dered her season and prevented her 
from excelling in her events: the 
ISO-yard and 50-yard butterfly. 

"Tia did not get to swim the way 
she wanted to, but it was really 
exciting to see her fulfill a dream of 
hers," McGihon said. 

Toulson, a third-year swimmer 
for the Tritons, was a versatile asset 
to the team. She swam the 150-
yard butterfly and 400-yard 
freestyle . 

"She just would go out there 
and do it," McGihon said. "She was 
the kind of student athlete that you 
want on your team." 

For next season, the men's team, 
which ended its season with a 13th-
place finish at thc NCAA Division 
n Championships, will need to find 
leadership and maturity in its 
younger swimmers next season. 
Meanwhile the women's side will 
look for hard-working swimmers to 
replace its departing seniors and

Baseball to lose key athletes ' 
Nine athletes, including five pitchers, leave team 
By COURTNEY FIELD 
Staff Writer 

Wi th a 30-23 -1 overall record 
and a 23 -17 record in league during 
he 200 1-2002 season, the UCSD 
baseball team worked its way 
through the ranks of the foreboding 
Division Il to prove itself as a force 
to be reckoned with in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association. 

Ll the inaugural Division n sea-
son for the Tritons last year, the team 
fini shed with a 7-28 record, leading 
many skeptics to believe that UCSD 
was not prepared to enter this level 
of competition. But this year, the 
Tritons proved those skeptics wrong. 

Led by nine seniors, the baseball 
team played strongly throughout the 
entire season; so strong, in fact, that 
one game decided the final playoff 
spot. 

"I-laving to win three out of four 
games on the road against UC Davis 
put us in the make-or-break posi-
tion," said senior pitcher Keith 
Smith. "We love that kind of compe-
tition," 

Along with Hanau (3 -5) and 
Smith (5-4), senior pitchers John 
Beaven (7-4), Robert Peclle (1-2) 
and John Schultz (5-5) will be leav-
ing the squad. 

"[Beaven] is everything you 
would hope for in a player. He was 
the ace of our pi tching staff and the 
team captain," said head coach Dan 
O'Brien. 

Even with his personal struggles 
this past year - his father, Alan, was 
killed on Flight 93, which crashed in 
Pennsylvania on Sept. II - Beavens 
outlook remains optimistic. A biolo-
gy major, Beaven will graduate in the 
fall and is currently awaiting the 
major league draft in the hopes of 
playing baseball in the minors. 

Each pitcher this year played an 
integral part in the success of the 
team. 

"This is the most talented pitch-
ing staff that I have seen," O'Brien 
said. "Peelle had some big outings 
for us this season, but has not 
received the recognition that he 
deserves for his hard work, and John 
Schultz had a tough year, but han-
dled his job weU ." 

O'Brien continued to praise his 
senior pitching staff. 

"Andy [Hanau] was a quiet guy, 
but was a big-time pitcher. He really 
set us up for success in many of our 
four-game series," he said. "Smith 
had the biggest impact of any player, 
considering the time he has been on 
the team. He understands the game 
and is able to take control and per-
form at a high level of play." 

In addition to the senior pitchers, 
the Tritons will lose most of their 
starting infield, including first base-
man Chad Addison, second baseman 
Anthony Lococo, third baseman 
Ryan Larson and catcher Tyler 
Sullivan. 

Addison, who started all 54 
games for UCSD this season, is sec-
ond on the 2001-2002 list for runs 
scored, RBIs and doubles. 

"Chad just had a great career 
with the ball club," O'Brien said. 

Fittingly, Addison will return 
next year as a graduate assistant 
coach under O'Brien for the 2002-
2003 season. 

"1 loved my four years here, so I 
guess it makes sense that I will be 
coming back to help out in some way 
next year," Addison said. 

Filling out the rest of the right 
side of the infield, Lococo's smart 
play earned him a starting spot at 
second base this season. The com-
munications major had the highest 

on-base percentage (.449) on the 
team, as well as a .504 slugging per-
centage. 

"[Lococos] leadership was great 
and he went about the season the 
way every coach would hope a play-
er would," O'Brien said. "It was his 
platoon this year and he handled his 
role admirably. It will be great hav-
ing him on the coaching staff next 
year." 

Struggling with some personal 
issues in the latter half of the season, 
third baseman Larson still managed 
to top the leader board. He had the 
highest slugging percentage at .5 22 
and also tied with designated hitter 
Jeff Riddle for the most home runs 
this season with six knocks apiece. 

"Larson's ability was just incredi-
ble. His bat was strong for us 
through the middle of the season," 
O'Brien said. 

Behind the plate, catcher Tyler 
Sullivan controlled the il1field. 
Sullivan played a major role in man-
ufacturing nms for the Tritons, lead-
ing in sacrifice bunts for the year. 

"He was a great asset to the team 
and provided leadership, as every 
catcher must," O'Brien said. 

After finishing at UCSD, Hanau 
will be earning his teaching creden-
tial and hopes to begin coaching at 
the high school level. Smith plans on 
going to law school while Schultz 
will work for a health care consulting 
group in San Francisco. 

Addison, Lococo and Peelle will 
return to UCSD on the coaching 
staff. 

O'Brien is excited about his play-
ers returning as coaches and mentors 
to the younger players. 

"You know your program is 
going in a good direction when play-
ers want to stick around," O'Brien 
said. 

Musings: 
Kings' poor free throw 
shooting cost them 
Continued from page Al2 

Clutch shooting and big defen-
sive plays helped the Kings stay 
even with the Lakers through four 
quarters. But overtime was a differ-
ent story when the Kings fell apart 
mentally and let the Lakers take the 
game (on some prime free throw 
shooting by O'Neal and Fisher). 
However, the overtime would not 
have been needed if the Kings 
managed to make 66 percent from 
the line - a poor showing on any 
night - but still good enough for a 
four-point victory for the Kings. 

Then there are the Lakers. 
Here I am talking about how the 
Kings should have won, how they 
had all the possibilities to win -
not only in the seventh game but 
throughout the series - and in the 
end, the only reason they lost is 
because they missed free throws. 
Couldn't the Lakers have done 
something to push the Kings 
towards elimination? Yes, they 
could have, but they didn't so 
much push as step our of the way 
whell the Kings werit for the kill. 

As the game closed, the Lakers 
began to look ' a lot like V1ade 
Divac, goofy smile and all. Divac 
has this move he pulls on opposing 
centers: He lets them back him 
down, and then, when the man he 
is guarding lowers the shoulder and 
goes for the hoop, V1ade disap-
pears. He just flits off across the 
lane while his man stumbles, falls, 
turns over the ball and generally 
looks like a fool, but it works. 

V1ade does this at least once or 
twice a g2me; it is one of the rea-
sons the Kings were able to con-
tain Shaq for the first five games of 
the series and it is what the LaIters 
did in the founh quaner of game 
seven. 

Duri ng the fourth quarter, 
Kobe didn't score a point, Fox 
cooled down and the only player 
who was doing anything was 
Superman himself: Shaq. They just 
slipped away and let the Kings 
stumble and fall (i .e., Peja and 
Christie getting nothing but air 
from beyond the arc). 

This is certainly a way to win, 
and anything that gets the "W" is 
acceptable, right' But isn't there a 
difference between playing to win 
and playing not to lose, even if the 
results at the end of the day are the 
same? The Lakers played this 
series not to lose, while the Kings 
played to win. Sacramento came 
up short, but in their hearts they 
know they gave it everything they 
had and came up short. Hell, they 
probably had the same thoughts of 
failure flashing through their heads 
I did every time I lofted an IS-
footer as a freshman in high 
school, but they still tried. 

The Lakers never played to win 
- never tried. It took them till the 
fourth quarter to realize that the 
Kings wanted the finals so bad that 
their whole mind, body and soul 
was focused on winning and play-
ing the best that they could. It is a 
testament to the strength of the 
Lakers that they were able to play 
this way and still win. But do you 
think the Kings are going to fall for 
the same disappearing act twice? 
Do you think they are even going 
to let the series get to seven games 
with a healthy Peja sinking his silky 
J from downto\m? 

The Lalc.ers better stan playing 
with some heart, because there is 
no way the Kings are going to hit 
only 50 percent of their ftee 
throws again. The Lakers are 
probably sitting on their dairy-
aires right now thinking about why 
- when they have arguably the 
two best players in the game -
they played not to lose. Instead, 
Kobe has once again smirked his 
way into the NBA finals.

Three Tritons have rowed last race 
Stringer, Wolsbom, Peerali leave crew teams 
ByANU KUMAR 
Associate Sports Editor 

UCSD crew are going to miss 
three members who are soon 
graduating after steadily con-
tributing as Tri tons . Jennifer 
Wolsborn, Lisa Peerali and 
Catherine Stringer have all 
rowed their final race for UCSD 
crew. 

Although departing seniors 
Wolsborn and Peerali rowed for 
a combined three years at 
UCSD, their efforts have led the 
Tri tons to recen t success in the 
water. 

Wolsborn rowed during her 
high school career in Redwood, 
Texas, and joined UCSD crew 
during her senior year. During 
this past season, Wolsborn 
moved immediately into the var-

sity eight boat, where she was 
usually at the front, leading her 
team. 

"Jennifer contributed strongly 
to our varsity boat this year," said 
women's crew head coach Pattie 
Pinkerton. "It's a shame we only 
had her for one year." 

Peerali began rowing for the 
Tritons during her junior year. 
She was also a varsity eight boat 
member and helped UCSD row 
to success. 

At the Pacific Coast Rowing 
Championships May 18, 
Wolsborn and Peerali were in sep-
arate varsity eight boats and each 
finished third to earn bronze 
medals. 

Stringer, a three-year varsity 
rower, will be graduating after 
only three years at UCSD. She 
has been a cOlCSwain for the men's 

varsity crew team for the past two 
seasons. 

A human development major 
from Sherman Oaks, Calif., 
Stringer coxed the varsity four 
boat at the 2001 Pac- IO Rowing 
Championships to third place. 

This past season, Stringer 
coxed a varsity boat throughout 
the year. At this year's Pac-IO 
Rowing Championships in Lake 
Natoma, Calif., Stringer was the 
coxwin of UCSD's varsity four, 
which took fourth place. 

The women's crew team has a 
strong core of rowers returning 
next year, but the presence of 
Wolsborn and Peerali will still be 
missed in the · varsity boats. For 
men's crew head coach Nlichael. 
Fi lippone, Stringer's experience 
and leadership will be hard to 
replace.

To all Laker-haters: Bring me

but he didn't buy a championship

Burger said. 

After the award ceremony, the 
annual tournament party com-
menced, and while the Stanford 
team retreated to the confines of 
its house for a team meeting, 
UCSD was so loose that the team 
stayed out till the wee hours, par-
rying with the best of them. 

The Psycaughtits had already 
beaten Stanford once, and they 
had won the Stanford tournament 
and made it to the finals of two 
other tournaments. They had only 

UCSD softball her junior year, 
Martinelli gave the Tritons a sec-
ond pitching option to compli-
ment Harlan. The two worked out 
brilliantly together; Martinelli 
matched Harlan's l7-win total in 
the 2001 season and then went on 
to better it with a 20-win mark 
this past year. Opposing batters 
were consistently left shaking 
their heads when Martinelli 
blazed a rising fastball past them 
and notched 208 strikeouts -
more than one for every inning 
she pitched. Although her individ-
ual numbers are outstanding, 
Martinelli finds her joy in the 

playoRS is the same team that got 
swept out of the postseason count-
less times by the league'S biggest 
disgrace, the Utah Jazz. Shaq, 
Kobe, Derek Fisher, Roben Horry 
and Rick Fox, the core of the latest 
Lakeshow, were also the nuclei of 
the Lakers who completely fell 
apart and shriveled away when a 
challenge faced them. 

What's the difference? It's not 
money, favorable referees or any 
other excuse that Sacramento can 
think of. 

Shaq, Kobe and the rest of the 
Lakers learned that they can use 
each other to win . The talented 
squad realized that when they 
mixed correctly, there was no 
team that could beat them four 
times to elilninate them from the 

two losses on the year and were 
confident that they could beat 
Stanford in the finals . 

"We went Out and partied the 
night before," Goodman said. "I 
want it to be known that Stanford 
stayed at home and that even the 
next morning, we were dancing on 
the sidelines, loose and ready to 
play." 

One of the reasons the 
Psycautits played so well during 
the tournament was their coach. 
Known only as Coach Pav, she has 
been playing ultimate for over 20 
years and is one of the best players 
in the nation. Pav is the one who 
helps the team setup defensive and 
offensive plays, and most impor-
tantly, she taught the team to 
adapt to game-time situations. 

UCSD beat Stanford because 

team. 
"It's about just being able to 

work alongside a group of girls 
tllat I love and respect, and work-
ing as a group toward a common 
goal," Martinelli said. 

While a few of that group will 
graduate this year, the accom-
plishments of these Triton seniors 
will be rerrtembered by their 
teammates in coming seasons 
while they strive to maintain the 
standard of excellence that has 
been established. That will be no 
easy task, however, because these 
seniors leave big shoes to fill and 
footprints that won't soon fade. 

playoffs. 
As evidenced by this past series 

against the Kings, the Lakers 
make you beat all five guys on the 
court, not just one or two. Neither 
Shaq nor Kobe played with the 
dominance they had once shown 
during a long; seven-game series, 
but the Lakers sti ll came out on 
top. 

Say what you want about the 
Lakeshow and think what you 
will, but you will never be able to 
cover up the beauty and domi-
nance of the purple and gold. 

Oh, and to the guy with the

it could adapt. Stanford scored a 
couple quick points off of hucks 
downfield, but the Psycaughtits 
recognized this, shut-down the 
huck and went on the counterat-
tack. Stanford couldn't adjust to 
UCSD's defense and lost the game 
15-7. 

"Our ability to adapt was huge. 
We changed our defensive strate-
gy and, therefore, the game. In 
this tournament, our offense real -
ly flowed from our D," Goodman 
said. 

The Psycaughtits look to 
return to the top of the collegiate 
ultimate ranks next year. Despite 
losing eight players, they have had 
stellar recruiting classes the last 
two years and are confident that 
they can malc:e another run for the 
national championship.

A22 SPORTS THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, JUNE 6, 2002 

Men's and women's track part with seniors 
Tritons leaving the team take many records, honors with them 

T he seventh game of the 
Lakers-Kings senes 
had a special feel. 

After SIX games, the teams knew 
each other. Al l of Lakers' head coach 
Phil Jackson's tricks had been u ed 
lip and each team played great bas-
ketba ll. For a little while, the game 
was in sporting nirvana. 

The jerseys were secondary in 
imponance [Q the poetry-in-motion 
of the Kings' fast breaking and Kobe 
jump shooting. Then this heart-
rending sOlmd started to reverberate 
throughout Arco Arena: dank, clank, 
dank. The Kings couldn't hit a free-
throw. The game's veneer broke by 
the Kings' inabil iry to make the easi-
es t shot in basketball. On their home 
COUft, the Kings had the heartS and 
souls of 20,000 fans screaming 
"memes" behind them, and they 
made only 16 of 30 free throws. 

How is thi s possi ble? It is 
unheard of for a professional team to 
shoot that poorly for a game. A 
number like that belongs to a high 
school team - to kid that are so 
tired when they get to the line, they 
can't shoot the rock because they 
ha\'e no legs left. 

In contrast, the Lakers went 27-
for- 33 fro m the line and haqtIille 
O'Neal had four of those misses. 
T hey outscored the Kings by 13 
points from the line. There i no way 
a team can expect to win when they 
ha\'e that kind of free throw differen-
tial. It is a testament to the will and 
heart of the boys from Sac-town that 
they were able to stay in the game.

StaH Writer 

After tying for 32nd overall on 
the women's side and 44th on the 
men's side a t this year's ational 
C ollegiate Athl etic Association 
Division II Championsh ips, 
UCSD track and field wi ll lose 
several key athletes on both teams. 

In all, the seniors will take with 
them three school records, three 
C alifornia Collegiate Athletic 
Associatio championships, three 
All -American honors and a handful 
of the top- 10 marks in school histo-
ry. Also, they will take wi th them 
their leadershi p and the experience 
of helping a Division m squad tran-
si tion to the Di vision II level. 

On the men's side, the most 
notable loss is Rob Ewanio, the 
school record-holder in the shot 
put and a defending two-time 
CCAA champion in the same 
event. Ewanio went on a tear in 
the final weeks of the seaso n, 
breaking his school record in con-
secutive meets heading into 
nationals, where he placed sixth 
after taking fifth his junior year. 

"You don't find athletes like that. 
H e's really a Division I-quali ry ath-
lete," said head coach Tony Salerno. 
"He'll go down as one of the top 
athletes in school history, and prob-
ably the sport as well." 

According to Salerno, it was 
E wanio's fire that enabled him to 
be more successful. 

"Part of what he did was with his 
intensity," Salerno said. "He's really

al qualifier in the 1,500 and owns 
several of the top times in school 
history in the 800 meters and 1,500 
meters, including the record in the 
1,500. Wong also placed second in 
the 1,500 as a junior at the CCAA 
meet when he lost by .02 seconds. 

"He was our top point-getter 
throughout the year and a real 
anchor for the team," Salerno said. 
"It's nice to have someone who's a 
real [competitor) like Jon in the 
800 and 1,500." 

Mark Gomez established him-
self as one of the top pole vaulters 
in school history. His personal 
record of 16 3/4 ties him for the 
fourth-best mark in UCSD history. 

"He's been a steady and out-
standing performer for four years," 
Salerno said. "Just a real enjoyable 
person to have around, [and] real 
positive." 

Gomez narrowly missed a berth 
to the NCAA championships 
because his provisional qualification 
mark fell just short of where they

drew the line at the top 16 marks. 

"It would have been great to 
see him go - he would have done 
real well there," Salerno said. 

Another notable loss for the 
men is Steve Smith, who won the 
800 meters at conference champi-
onships as a sophomore, a perfor-
mance that ranked him in the top 
seven all-time school marks. 

Among the other seniors leav-
ing are Ryan Vincent, who placed 
third in the high jump at the 
CCAA meet this yea r, Phong 
Long, who finished third in the 
long jump and ninth in the triple 
jump, and Rui Almazon, who fin-
ished eighth in the triple jump. 

The women's team will lose 
Megan Bergin, who qualified for 
her first national championship 
meet this season in the hammer 
throw. There, the 14th-seeded 
Bergin played the role of spoiler, 
finishing eighth with a mark of 
166 feet to earn her All-America 
honors for the first time. 

"We've got a little bit of a hole 
there in the hammer throw," 
Salerno said. "Its tough to find an 
athlete of her caliber. Certainly she 
was one of the athletes on the team 
that when competition came 
around, she was ready to step up, 
and she was doing that consistently." 

Bergin's personal record of 166 
II , set at this year's CCAA cham-
pionships, is also a school record. 
The throw was good enough for 
third place in the confe rence and 
was her NCAA provisional qualifi -
cation mark. 

Other seniors include Lynne 
Brinkman, who placed fourth in 
the javelin at conference champi-
onships this seaso n, Cather ine 
Nolan, who finished sixth in the 
same event, dista nce runner J\1ary 
Peate, sprinter Erin Newman and 
throwers Megan Steel and Katie 
Vater, though several of them may 
return next year becau e they have 
a year of eligibil ity left. 

Salerno remains optimistic 
about putting a strong squad out 
next season despite key losses due 
to graduation. 

"We've got a good recruiting 
year on the men's side - as good 
as we've ever had - and [I expect 
a) phenomenal year on the 
women's side," Salerno said. 

Though the team remains opti -
mistic about next season, there is no 
denying that the impact this gradu-
ating class made this season was sig-
nificant to both the team and to the 
track and field program overall. 

"They've been the people who 
really led us into Division II," 
Salerno said . "And it's the mental -
iry of what we've been expecting of 
them having to line lip against 
Division I sc hools like UCLA. 
Thats going to be their legacy. II

Women's 
ultimate 
crowned 
Psycaughtits 
win national 
championship 
8yTAITMIWI 
Associate Sports Editor 

UCSD women's ultimate fris-
bee claimed a national champi-
onship by defeating Stanford, 15-7, 
in the culmination of a three-day 
tournament May 26 in Spokane, 
Wash. 

In an awesome display of 
defense and offense, the 
Psycaughtits peaked at the right 
time and had little trouble dis-
patching their opponents. They 
went undefeated for the tourna-
ment and never allowed a team to 
score in double digits. 

Starting on May 24, UCSD 
steamrolled through the opposi-
tion and set the tone for the rest of 
the tournament in its first game. 
The Psyca ughtits played 
Universiry of North Carolina, 
Chapel Hill, which tried to extend 
its sporting dominance beyond the 
bounds of men 's basketball and 
women's soccer. But UCSD would 
have none of it and the 
Psycaughtits shut down UNC's 
deep game, with Alicia White lay-
ing out for a couple of great catch-
es to help UCSD to a 15-6 win. 

The scores over the next three 
days looked much the same when 
no team could keep up with 
UCSD's stellar attack, and the 
Psycaughtits appeared incredibly 
focused Out on the field. 

"We have been practicing since 
October," said team captain Dania 
Goodman. "Nationals has been a 
goal of ours the whole }'ear and we 
firmly believed that we could win. 
Everyone stepped up and peaked at 
the right time." 

Last year, the Universiry of 
Georgia \mocked the Psycaughtits 
out of nationals, so when UCSD 
faced them in the fourth round, the 
smell of retribution was in the air. 

UGA lost many key players to 
graduation last year, and this year it 
didn't have the legs to keep up with 
UCSD. The HoDawgs of Georgia 
fell 15-5 to the stellar UCSD coun-
terattack. 

"This was a bit of a revenge 
game for us after getting \mocked 
out last year by them, so it felt 
good to beat Georgia," Goodman 
said. 

The closest game of the tourna-
ment for the Psycaughtits came in 
the semifinals, where they played 
MIT for a spot against Stanford in 
the championship game. The game 
stayed close until UCSD exploded 
to outscore the Smites 8-4 over the 
remainder of the game for a 15-9 
win. 

On the next night, after all the 
semifinal matches were finished, 
there was an awards ceremony. 
UCSO's Stacey Burger came in 
fifth for the Callahan, an award 
that goes to a player that exhibits 
great skill on the field, plays the 
game in the spirit it is intended and 
helps lead and improve the players 
around her. 

Burger is a four-year player at 
UCSD and has witnessed the evo-
lution of the program into a 
national champion.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN SPORTS A23 

Softball loses four athletes who raised program 
Anderson, Harlan, Hayes and Martinelli leave Triton careers 
Iy BRYCE WARWICK 
Staff Writer 

Over the past four years, the 
UCSD softball team has amassed 
an impressive 121-69 record and 
has grown into one of the best 
teams in the region. That rise was 
not without the significant contri-
butions of four seniors who will 
leave the program this year. 

Kristina Anderson, Leea 

the lineup card ever since. 
Anderson started in 175 of the 
Tritons' 190 games over her four 
years, and she also picked up big 
hits while playing a solid defensive 
outfield. In her senior season, she 
was named as an honorable men-
tion to the All-California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
Softball Team. 

their birth into the West Region 
playoffs, where they received the 
third seed. 

In her split season, Hayes has 
no problem picking out her 
favorite moment. 

"Senior day," Hayes said. "We 
played as a team and it was a very 
memorable day. We came through 
and did a great job." 

Mixing a variery of pitches with 
a deadly change-up, the move to 
Division n hardly slowed Hayes 
down, since she earned All-CCAA 
Second Team honors in both her 
junior and senior campaigns. 

For all Hayes has given to the 
program, she is quick to note that 
the program has given back to her 
as well. 

Harlan, Samantha Hayes and 
Christi Martinelli are at the end of 
their Triton sports careers, but 
they leave behind a list of accom-
plishments and accolades suggest-
ing that they will be gone but not 
forgotten. 

All the Triton players said the 
friendships they made on the-team 
are a large part of what has made 
their UCSD experience special. 
None of them would know better 
about the interactions between 
people than second baseman 
Hayes, who majors in human 
development with a minor in soci-
ology. 

On that day, Hayes had two 
hits, scored a run and drove in 
three runs, but it was another 
senior who grabbed the headlines 
when Harlan pitched a one-hitter 
for one of her 60 wins as a UCSD 
pitcher. 

Harlan led the Tritons in wins 
for three of her four years, and she 
amassed an incredible 677.1 
innings while holding an ERA of 
only 1.45. While beating up on 
Division III competitors her 
sophomore year, Harlan earned 15 
victories and allowed less than one 
run per game. 

" Part of the reason I decided to 
come here was that this organiza-
tion is designed for making play-
ers better and making itself better. 
UCSD is a very special place to 
me," Harlan said. "I just wish 
everybody was as lucky as I am to 
have something in their life like 1 
had." 

Anderson, UCSD's starting 
left-fielder, is a career .317 hitter 
who was a solid batter in the 
Triton lineup all four years. She 
led the team with an incredible 
.'IM batting average her freshman 
year and has found her name on 

Hayes hit a career-high .288 
this season, despite having her 
playing time limited due to an 
injury that cost her much of the 
first part of the year. Her return 
helped push the Tritons toward

year when she finishes up her 
studies in math and computer sci-
ence, but another Triton ace and

Tadlock ends tennis days 
Women's tennis will miss her leadership 
By COlEY HOLMAN 
Staff Writer 

It's difficult to lose a senior 
under any circumstances, but 
losing Lyndsey Tadlock will def-
initely have a dramatic impact 
on UCSD women's tennis. 

As the team's lone senior, 
Tadlock is the only current 
member of the team to play in 
both Division m and Division 
II, and she was one of the most 
influential players in helping the 
transition two years ago. 

Tadlock's career was marked 
by four consecutive trips to. the 
National Collegiate Athletic 
Association National 
Championship. A second-place 
finish during Tadlock's last year 
in Division m would mark the 
Tritons' highest achievement 
with the Thousand Oaks native 
on their roster. 

However, it was not until the 
last home match of her senior 
year when Tadloclc would reach 
her defining moment as a 
Triton. In the NCAA Western 
Regional, UCSD and Grand 
Canyon were tied 4-4, with 
Tadlock's match against 
Christine LiWanPo serving as 
the deciding point. Tadlock 
came back from being a set 
down to win 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, in 
front of the largest crowd of the 
season. 

"It was the perfect scenario," 
said coach Liz LaPlante of 
Tadlock's last home victory. -It 

couldn't have been written bet-
ter for a movie. All that was 
missing was the music in the 
bacltground and the slow 
motion." 

It was the way Tadlock won 
the 1m much that epitomized 
her playing style and entire 
career as a Triton. Down during 
the first set, Tadlock changed 
her tactic to a more conservative 
approach, letting the less-expe-
rienced LiWanPo make the 
mistakes. The strategy worked 

CourIay 01 UCSO AIIietiIs 

Lenin&: Lindsey Tadbck had a 
dramatic v.in in her final home match 
in a match marked by incredibly 
long rallies. 

"The thing that stands out 
about her play is her ability to 
adapt to her opponent, .. 
LaPlante said. "We're going to 
miss that next year. ~ 

Besides her accomplish-
ments on the court, Tadlock 
also served as team leader since 
she was the only senior. 

"Since her second year, 
[when she became the team's 
oldest player), she was serving in 
a leadership role," LaPlante 
said . uShe always tries her hard-
est in practice and that rubs off 
on the rest of the team." 

Tadlock is not the only 
member of the her family that 
UCSD will miss next year. 

"Her parents and family 
were so supportive of the team," 
LaPlante said. "They traveled to 
every match - home and away 
- and that will be missed next 
year. Every girl on the team 
\mew them." 

Tadlock's intangible qualities 
are the type that can't be put 
into words. Though not the 
most talented player on the 
team, she proved to be one of 
the most reliable. In every close 
match, it was Tadlock coming 
through with the big victory to 
give the Tritons the edge. 

Tadlock was the epitome of 
a Triton tennis player. Her 
hard work and dedication -
not her talent alone - were 
what made her so special. Her 
contributions will definitely be 
missed nellt year, and UCSD 
will have to worle that much 
harder to advance to its 17th 
consecutive national champi-
onship in 2003.

82 SPECrAL GRADUATION SECTION 

b eing a G1UJrdian editor for the last year has, at times, felt more like a decade , I often wonder where the time has gone 
- my answer lies in a 

little paper that comes out twice a 
week. A paper that entertains, draws 
yawns, entices smiles, causes nasty 
letters to the editors, enrages a few 
and goes somewhat unnoticed. 

It is more than an all-consuming 
job, which at times makes me want 
to cli mb into a van and take up resi-
dence south of the border. Once 
there, I imagine I wOlud grow a 
beard and survive on fish and 
Coronas. Instead, I stayed, coordi-
nating another issue while Ieeeping 
one eye on the copy, and the other 
on the calendar while staying updat-
ed on the Baja weather repott. 

Too often we get the impression 
that the paper is the sum of the 
parts that created it and not the fin-
ished product that you mayor may 
not read. 

The paper does not belong to 
the editors, writers or anybody else 
on staff. It is yours. You are entided 
to be an informed member of the 
UCSD community. Just don't go 
looking for that statement to be 
written down somewhere, because 
it isn't. Sometimes, after long hours 
slaving away, we don't remember 
that, but if we ever forget, we need 
you to remind us. 

I hope we kept you informed 
and interested. 

If your diversity rally went 
unnoticed by the news section, it 
was not because myself or anyone 
here was busy trying to get Ward 
Connerly to raise money for Gary 
Bauer's 2002 run for the presiden-
cy. 

If your Students for Free Trade 
and Gun Rights luncheon went 

uncovered, it was not because I was 
out cultivating a communal garden 
for organic vegetables to serve to 
immigrants crossing the border in 
the desert. 

Sometimes things slip .through 
the cracks because of limited 
resources and the little-mown fact 
that we are not professionals. And 
then sometimes your events are just 
plain boring and not neW3Worthy. 
Regardless, this is still your news-
paper and, ultimately, we need you 
to keep us honest. Everybody here 
is approachable and needs feed-
back; our office (second floor of the 
Student Center, above the co-op) is 
usually open. So drop by, be willing 
to talk and don't light that 
Malatlcov cocletail. If it turns out 
you were ignored, let me mow and 
r will reluctantly give you a light. 
But in the meantime, keep next 
year's staff informed and honest. 
You are our best eyes and ears to 
the outside world. 

By now you have likely realized 
the "Senior Send-offs" may seem a 
bit egocentric, especiaUy coming 
from people you don't know, much 
less care about. Which is why I'm 
not going to waste any more of this 
newsprint tallcing about the paper 
or myself, since you have no reason 
to care about my favorite memories 
of the last four years. It's your 
paper, not mine. Instead, I'm writ-
ing about something that needs to 
be told but rarely is, and that is that 
you are pretty damn lucky. 

We all hear the cries of, "This 
place sucks. It's boring no parties, 
no community, high rent, expen-
sive parking, suspect administra-
tion and student government, 
overcrowding, student apathy, and 
that big damn hill in the middle of 
campus." 

But, contrary to popular belief, 

THE'UCSO'GUARDIAN , THURSDAY, JUNE 6, 2002 

-------geoff dietrich---
this school does not suck; you /ITt 
fortunate to be going to the 
University of California at San 
Diego. Although the academics are 
good, that's not why you're lucky. 
You don't need me hailing UCSD's 
academics. 

San Diego is a great place to live 
after high school and before the 
real world. The place has got it all, 
from world -class surf to a scenic 
back country. From the mundane 
concrete jungle of the Golden 
Triangle to the dynamic beach 
commWlities. 

If one were confined to campus 
- except for jaunts to UTC or 
Tijuana's night clubs - one could 
come to the conclusion that life at 

UCSD sucks, which it may. But life 
in San Diego doesn't need to, 
which is exactly why you are fortu-
nate to have been or will continue 
to be in San Diego. 

I first realized this as a freshman 
when I was visiting some family 
friends who were staying on the top 
floor of the Mission Bay Hilton. 
From there, on that warm. sunny, 
clear day I could see from Mount 
Soledad to downtown, with the 
beach and bay full of people out 
and about. 

While the experience was not an 
epiphany and I definitely did not 
scream, "Eurelca! Lord Triton, I 
have found the meaning of life!" r 
did realize there was a lot more 

important, interesting and worth-
while stuff to life at UCSD than 
just UCSD. 

This may sound more like a 
"welcome to four years in San 
Diego" piece - that may be 
because in every ending there is a 
new beginning. So if you are going 
to spend this summer researching 
how to transfer to UC Berleeley or 
UCLA - like many of you are -
remember: It's not UCSD that 
sucks, but maybe your approach to 
it that does. 

This school may have sucked, 
but your life doesn't have to. Take 
advantage of this place and this 
time of your life while you still can, 
because it will be over far too soon. 

--malavika g a n go II y---

f or most of us, graduation is just another chapter in our lives. In just 10 days, we will leave behind our friends, memories and the place that 
we have called home for the last 
four years. 

Like others that will be graduat-
ing this year, I too feel sad at the 
prospect of leaving behind the 
friends that have become a second 
family to me, but as my friend 
Grace recently pointed out to me, 
"Life is about leaving people." 

Why, then, is this so difficult' I 
think it is because whenever I try to 
think of the defining moments in 
Illy life over the course of tlle past 
four yea rs, my friends were aJways 
[here to su pport me along the way. 

YOLI see, the most amazing 
thing about college is that when it 
is all said and done, the lessons we 
learn here are forever ingrained in 
our memories. And, while J will 
take away with me all the knowl-
edge I gained through the course-
work I completed, I will be the 
first to admit that the biggest 
lessons I learned have been those 
that were learned outside of the 
classroom. 

Gloria Steinem once said, "This 
is the last period of time that will 
seem lengthy to you at only three 
or four years . From now on, time 
will pass without artificial academic 
measure. It will go by like the wind. 
Whatever you want to do, do it 
now. For life is time and time is all 
there is." 

As I wri te this today, her words 
govern my thoughts, because if I 
have learned anything in the past 
four years, it is that we would be 
doing ourselves an injustice if, in 
the future, we looked back on these 
years with regret. 

Years from now, r will loole back 
on my time in college and Icnow 
that these were some of the best 
years of my life. To all those that 

have had an impact on my life, I 
thank you . 

To my fellow editors at the 
Gllardian: You have all taught me 
so much in the past four years. I 
have a great deal of respect for all 
of you and I wish you luck in all of 
your endeavors. This is a chal-
lenging profession and I want to 
thank you all for constantly reaf-
firming my faith in our work as 
journalists. 

Claire: It has been a pleasure to 
work on the features section with 
you this year. I have always admired 
your unique style of writing and I 
have no doubt that you will be able 
to work wonders as the opinion 
editor nex~ year l 

Lindsay: You are a very gifted 
writer, and I know that you will do 
a fantastic job with the fearures sec-
tion next year! 

I have been lucley enough to 
have had a very close-kni t group of 
friends throughout my four years 
here. I will miss you all, and I will 
always remember the good times 
that we have shared. 

Parvez: You were one of my first 
friends at UCSD and I am glad that 
we have remained close. You have 
so many amazing qualities and I 
mow that you will be successful in 
whatever you choose to do. Good 
luck next year, Skeelo! 

Gavin: Thanks for being such a 
good friend during the past few 
years. I'll miss hanging out with 
you next year. It is rare that I have 
come across someone who is as sin-
cere as you are - don't change! 

Ashvin: I know that your ambi-
tion will lead to many successes in 
the years to come. Have a good 
time in New Yorle this summer. r 
mow that you won't need it, but 
good lucie next year! 

Payal : Thank you for being such 
a dedicated friend during the past 
four years. r always knew r could 
depend on you, and that has been a 

big comfort to me. "Ami Tomake 
Bishon Bhalo Bashi!" 

Sawsan: I can't help but laugh 
whenever I think of all of the 
"Sawsan stories" that have enter-
tained US for the past few years. 
Thanks for all the advice you've 
given me and for being such a good 
listener whenever I needed to talle 
to someone. Good luck next year! 

Tanmai: Since I got back from 
D.C., things haven't really been the 
same with us, and I want you to 
know that I really miss the way 
things used to be. Even though we 
have both been preoccupied with 
other things, I want you to mow 
that our friendship means a lot to 
me and I will always consider you 
one of my closest friends. 

Shefali : I do not mow what I 
would have done without you dur- . 
ing the past four years. You have 
always been there for me and I am 
so grateful for your friendship. 
Never doubt yourself; you are one 
of the most hard-working people I 
have ever met, and you deserve all 
of the successes that come your 
way. I mow that you are nervous 
about moving next year, but mow 
that I'll only be a phone call away if 
you ever need to talk. Take care of 
yourself in Georgia next year. 

Ashwin: Four years ago, I 
would never have imagined that 
our bond would grow to be what it 
is today. You have brought a great 
deal of laughter into my life and I 
can't thank you enough for that. 
Your optimism, sincerity and 
compassion are all qualities that I 
love about you, and I feel so lucley 
to have you in my life. I have so 
many good memories of the past 
four years and many of them are 
with you. r will miss you next year 
when you go to Northwestern, 
but I am confident that we will 
survive the 2,OOO-mile distance. 
Thanle you for bringing so much 
happiness to my life. 1-4-), 

Lastly, to the people who have 
provided me with unconditional 
love and support for the past 21 
years - my family. 

Pri}'2: You have grown up to be 
a beautiful, intelligent and talented 
girl, and I am sure that you will 
continue to excel at everything you 
do. Remember that [ will always be 
here for you and that I am very 
proud of you. 

Ammama and Ajju: I have so 
much admiration for you both. 
Raising five children, II grandchil-

t o whom it may concern: The time I have spent at the C?uardian feels lilee an 
etermty. 

For the past three years, I have 
struggled to maintain an identity 
or a life away from the Guardian, 
and as pathetic as it may sound to 
people outside the newspaper staff, 
I have slowly come to realize how 
much the Guardian actually 

defined me. 
As the last of my GUilrdian days 

slowly wane, I am not quite sure 
how I feel about my experience 
here. On one hand, I feel sad 
because I am leaving a place that 
felt like a home away from home. r 
spent coundess hours of my life at 
the G,ulrtlitm and with the wonder-
ful people that work here. 

On the other hand, I feel a 
complete sense of liberation and [

feel lilee I have a chance to redis-
cover myself as someone other 
than a person that worles for the 
Guardilm. 

My experience as a loyal 
Guardianite has taught me a lot of 
lessons in life. I learned about peo-
ple. The best and the worst of peo-
ple are revealed through the late 
nights at the office, the long 
debates, the meetings, the wild par-
ties, the long drives to Las Vegas, in 
pubs and on the dance floor of the

My thanles also goes to one of 
the most underrated departments 
at the GUilrdian: the business staff. 
They war Ie tirelessly everyday try-
ing to generate the funds to keep 
this paper going. They gave me my 
first opporrunity here at the 
Guardilm and I'm glad they did. I 
want to thank each person on staff 
for their unique personalities. 
Thanks to everyone else at the

clubs. 

But the most important lesson I 
learned was to not take life, or the 
GUilrdilln, too seriously. I realized 
how important that lesson was 
when I saw a former editor taint 
his entire experience at the 
Guardian with a tirade on journal-
istic ethics and how he had better 
journalistic ethics than the rest of 
the staff. 

Basically, his final mark as an 
editor was making himself seem 
arrogant, angry and bitter at the 
supposed incompetence of the 
Guardian staff. He toole his work 
too seriously and forgot to proper-
ly thank the people that defined his 
college life. 

I vowed to try and make hianls 
the best section in the Guardian, 
but between all the hard work. I 
attempted to maintain a light-
hearted atmosphere as well. For 
many of us, the GUllrdian is the last 
time in an office setting where we 
will ever have such open and polit-
ically incorrect conversations 
about sex, drugs, music, religion, 
politics, sports, theater and soci-
ety. 

So enjoy it 
When it comes down to it, I 

enjoyed my time spent at the 
Guardian. I have met incredibly 
wonderful people that have 
changed my life and made my life 
brighter. My undying thanks goes 
to the hardworking hiatus writers 
who have stuck with me and my co-
editor, Charlie, for the entire year. 
Thanks to Charlie for his dedica-
tion and his hilarious personality. I 
wish nothing but the best for you, 

the incoming editors, especially 
Rinaldo, Anne and Mara. 

My experience here at the 
Guardilln and at UCSD was 
incredible and unforgettable. I 
have had many great times at wild 
patties (yes, they exist, and if worse 
comes to worst, throw your own

friends , experienced heartache and

Well, now for the thankS. This 
is going to read like the credits to a 
book or something, but bear with 
me. 

Thanks to Alison N ., who was 
a friend before the Guardian, still 
is a friend and will continue to be 
a dear friend no rna trer the dis-
tance. Thanks to Bill B. for his 
caring, for living life to the fullest

thanks to Melinda Lachance for 
all of her love, intel lect, humor 
and support , and fo r bringing

Again, thank you to everyone 
because each one of you made lily 
life and my experience here Jt

In the end, I feel liberated, bur I 
know I will feel an emptiness in my 
heart without this eclectic - to pu t 
it mildly - family mown as Tlu

people, don't take everything so 
seri ously. Because it doesn 't take 
much to see tl1 3t the petty prob-

THURSDAY. JUNE 6, 2002 

as I rewind the la t roll of film I'll ever take as phoro editor of the GIIfJ1'dlllll, I'm still amazed at the fact that I have 36 moments in tillle caprured in this tiny canister That'~ 36 moments that will never happen 
agalll. Thirty-six fractions of a second that, ro some p!!ople, 
may mean nothing, but to others , may mean the world. 

:\ I y photo career starred our 10 years ago when [ was just 
a ,crawny kid With a tiny, fearure-free, compact camera. 
Abour 99 percent of my photos then were horrible. Now I'm 
10 years older and wiser, and have a camera that consists of 
too many bells and whistles - and 99 percent of my photos 
arc still crap. But what drives me is that one percent. Those 
precious few images that truly astound, that truly delight and 
tha t truly affect. That is my passion, my love, my motivation. 
Strt\1ng to make a photo that will make a difference, no mat-
ter how sma ll, in someone's life. 

That is why I became a photojournalist. Being a photO-
Jo urnalist makes me see beyond a photograph; it makes me 
;ca rch for not only the perfect image but to also understand 
the Imperfections of the elements that make up such a photo. 
And It is this never-ending search that has led me to so many 

placc~. led Ill!! to meet so many people, led me to experience 
,0 much of lifc. 

I remember shooo ng a happy couple exchanging vows at 
a slinple ceremony by the beach. [ remember kid cOllling up 
to me to a~k for a look through my camera at a Little League 
gJlIle. I remember capturing joy of the swimmers of my high 

~chool swim team when they won the national title . I remem-
ber photographing the the camaraderie between players 
\I hen I shot m!, first major league game. 

But it's not all fun and games. I remember shooti ng a grass 
fire I stupidly tried to get close to, landmg me three days in 
hed with smoke in my lungs. I remember a bastard senior AP 
photographer blocking my lens at a 4ger game. I remember 
bemg threatened by big, bad-ass dudes for attempting to take 
photographs of them selling cocaine to kids. I remember 
bcmg snubbed by Jose Can eco (Canseco! Of all people!) 
\I hen all I wanted was a simple photoblTaph. I remember 
,hooting a rugby game where it rained so hard, m)' flash short-
CIrCUited and I had to spend my food money repairing it. I 
remcmber crying at a friend 's (uneral I was fo rced to cover. 

I ,hoot because I believe that when words fail, photogra-
ph\' still holds the power to disrurb, motivate and, most 
Irnporta ncly, enlighten. Good photOgraphy educates and 
mtnrms us about the present. It illuminates and honors the 
pm. It records everything and anything: goot!, bad, beautiful 
and ugl y. It is an impartial medium. J shoot because I want to 
cun,trlJct a better understanding of this complicated world . 
That's what photojournalism does: It pushes us to embrace 
our humanity, as well as to confront the inhumanity that is 
very real among us. It places us anud people who are strug-
gling against tremendous odds, as well as people who affirm 
the triumph of the human spirit. 

I was afraid that J wouldn't get a chance to carry on shoot-
Ing after high school; that I would slowly lose my drive and 
passion for photojournalism. But I'm glad I was wrong. I'm 
extremely forrunare to be able to continue as a photojournal-
Ist here at the Glial-dian . I have photographed 50 much of 
UCSD. I sang along to tlle songs at concerts, pumped my fist

and every one of you. To those who are lea\;ng: Good luck on 
whatever paths you choose. To those who are staying on: I hope 
you continue to improve with every click of the shuner. 

Tyler, I have no doubt that you'll be a bITCH photo editor. 
Your dedication is amazing and your potential is limitless. Best 
ofluck, and may your term as photo editor be as fruitful and ful -
filling as mine. Also, a special thanks to Gerry Mooney, a !-ITeat 
photojournalist and an even bener teacher and fricn I. Thank 
you for putting a camera in my hand and telling me nm to pho-
tograph what my eye saw, but to photograph what my heart felt. 

As a first-hand witness, and as a member of the Gum-dial/, 
I have caprured all these events to hopefully contribute a visu-
al history that one generation can pass on to the next. It is 
truly gratifying to be surrounded with people who are as 
devoted to the taSK of bridging the many facets of UCSD to 
the general srudent population as I am. My experience here at 
UCSD is greatly enhanced by being around my coworkers, 
who are simply incredible and brilliant. Thank you all for the 
joy, the laughter, the pressure, the sadness and, most impor-
tantly, the love that you have so generously given me during 
my brief, two-year stay at the paper. Thank you fo r making 
the eFfort to produce a photo-friendly paper. My sincerest 
regards to 'each and every " "e of you, even though all of you 
hate my beloveo Yankees. 

To my sensational photo staff, to whom I have tried my very 
best to be a val uable friend and teacher: You guys are the best 
photo staff I have ever worked with and I am so proud of each 

T hough my time as photo editor comes slowly \0 an end, 
my life as a photographer has barely begun . As I pocket a roll 
of film and start to head back to the office, I see a bov wear-
ing a Bannan T-shirt with a cape on the field playing catch 
with his dad. I stOp for a minute, taking in the uninhibi ted 
elation that the kid has in his laughter, that unbridled joy he 
has in his eyes. I pullout a new roll of film, load it in my 
Nikon, set the proper aperture and shutter speed, lift the 
viewfinder to my eye, and get rcady to capture that "one" 
photo. That one photo that will Freeze, that will hold, that 
will stay ... this moment.

• t's fun ny how after two years 

I of writing enough art icles for the Guardill71 to make a book, I find myseJ f speechless in this, my last article . My si tua-
tio n is a bit different from the 
other graduating Guardianites in 
these pages because I' m not leav-
ing the Guardill1l because I am 
graduating from UCSD. I 'm leav-
ing because one of the many 
things I learned from my stint at 
the Guardian is that journalism is 
not for me. But I suppose I'd bet-
ter start at the beginning before I 
get ahead of myself; once I get 
ahead of myself it's difficult to go 
forward because you leeep wanting 
to look back. 

I came to UCSD last year, fresh 
out of high school and all bright-
eyed and bushy-tailed _ r had no 
previous journalism experience 
whatsoever - the only reason I 
picked up an application and went 
to the recruitment meeting was 
because the girl at the recruiting 
table (who would later become my 
boss) was cute. 

But as I started writing for the 
GUO/'dian, I became hooked on see-
ing my name in the paper every 
week. As every writer mows, there 
is a euphoric rush that accompanies 
seei ng your wo rk displayed in any 
medium. It's like, "H ey, people can 
read my work! They could even 
like it! " I clipped every article I 
wrote from m y first year as ifI were 
a proud mother rather than a crack 
journalist . 

Come winter quarter, I became 
associate sports editor. I was 
pro ud and thrilled that I was 
named to that posi tion after less 
than a quarter of writing. Of 
course, the only other candidate 
disappeared over winter break and

- -- I S a a c pearlman -----

In the GlIa,-dfllll office, intelli -
gence and hard work collided with 
deadlines, stress and a roomful of 
strangers to create a close-knit 
team. [ think the Gllardill71 office 
is the only place in the world 
where conversations of local , state 
and national politics would be 
interspersed with heated discus-
sions of the most effective sexual 
position while a plane is crashing, 
the exact definition of a chode, the 
deli cate intricacies of a battle 
between ninjas and pirates, or the 
merits of being a hooker in Vegas 
vs. a beach bum (i t was agreed that 
the two be co mbined into a beach 
hooker) . And those are just the 
surface of the issues discussed at 
the Guardilll/ . From the donkey 
show in Tijuana , to the pros and 
cons of a major league baseball 
salary cap, to pretty much any si r-
uation regarding alcohol, I am 
definitely goi ng to miss the con-
versa tions held at the GIiO/'dlall 
office. 

never came back to the Guardian. 
That was all she wrote, as they say, 
for at the end of the year I 
destroyed the other candidates 
(nobody) for sports editor. Those 
were the steps of my ascension to 
power. But only now, looking 
back, can I truly appreciate the 
disparity between that inexperi-
e nced boy and the tired veteran 
currently writing this. 

Back then, all ] had was a titl e. 
Now, as I leave that title behind, I 
have so much more. I'm not talk-
ing about the considerable experi-
e nce I have gained, although that 

your year in South Africa that 
makes me see the with disa p-
pointment every time [ see you. 
If you weren't so damn down to 
earth, engaging and enjoyable to 
be around, I could consider hat-
ing you for it. 

To Ed Wu, shoe fetish victim 
and all-around gentleman: Ahem, 
that's quite a brain you've got 
there. Can I touch it? 

To Jake Wasserman, activist 
extraordinaire: I'm impressed by 
your gig, and you've accomplished 
some good sruff. Best of luck. 

Finally, to the incoming dicta-
tor, and perhaps the most humble 
genius of them all, Josh Crouse: 
You have a plethora of support 
from a brilliant staff. You have 

definitely will be valuable. You 
haven't learned how to properly 
swear at a computer until you've 
heard a Guardiall person do it. 
Tbe thing I will miss most about 
the Guardian is the people. The 
people. AJI I can do is shake my 
head when I think about the peo-
ple at the Guardian. Volumes 
wouldn't be enough to describe 
the unique individuals that com -
prise the Guardian staff. 

AJ though using collective 
descriptions to descri be these 
people 'is woefully inadequate, in 
the interes t of time and space 

the abilities, knowledge, 
resources and the charisma to do 
anything next year; make us 
proud, and enjoy. 

So it looks like I've forgotten 
way too many people. But writ-
ing this is damaging to my mood, 
and fuck, it is my column, and 
I'm not into forcing myself to 
think about this depressing 
" moving on" crap. Plus, this 
whole thing just reads like a long 
high school yearbook signing, so 
I'm ending it here with a bigfork 
you to anyone who's pissed that I 
left them out. To cap it off for 
anyone who's still re~ding, here 
are some words of wisdom: 
"Memory, so sad and sweet. I'll 
see you soon, save me a seat."

• t all began with a bottle of 
tequila in Las Vegas, Nev. I "Iore than three years ago, then-Editor in Chief Marc Comer asked me in passing if I 

wamcd [0 come on a staff trip [0 
Vegas. Sure, what the hell. 

:\'<' a lowly copyreader, I was about 
<l~ out-of-the-loop as it got. 
~(lnetheles~ , in the week leading 
lip to the trip, I hea rd scattered 
lllurll1urtngs of what an insane 
p.trtr/boozefest Vegas would cer-
ulIllv be. i\lavbe these dorks were 
acru~l l y oeia t'. 

I walked IOtO a packed hotel 
roOIll III the now-de funct Maxim 
abou t fi\'e hours late with Lisa and 
J~s ica. After just over four hours in 
th e ca r with them, I was certain of 
three things: 

I . They had secretly replaced all 
the fluids in my body with pure 
estrogen while I wasn't looking. 

Looking at the bottle, I couldn't 
help being surprised, myself. That 
night - and the weekend - ended 
up being well worth it. 

The Tequila Incident marked a 
major nlrning point in my life. 

Less than 24 ho urs later, [ was 
Ollt of money (Gimme a break - I 
was 3 Vegas virgin) . I skipped lunch 
the next day, and all I could afford 
for dinner was a lousy mushroom 
t3CO. I would eventually become 
accustomed to the nagging hunger, 
and over the next two years I ended 
up losi ng about 70 Ibs. 

But more importantly, I got to 
know some of my best friends that 
night. I bummed a couple Kool cig-
arettes off Joe. Norris and I shared 
a stogie with Brent Don. I sti fl ed 
nausea after watching Jenny silent-
ly signal "I love you" across the 
table to her current boyfriend in 
sign language. To my utter dismay, 
he signed back.

2. The gap between that semi 
and fl atbed pickup that Li sa drove 
her Civic through was somehow 
smaller than the car itself. 

3. I was ready for the party. 
I was actually surprised that 

everyone in the room was just sit-
ting around . I was also immediately 
aware of the fact that, of the 18 
Guardian affiliates present, I was 
the only non-editor besides little 
C harlie (and Joe, but he worked for 
the business office). Really, the only 
people I even slightly knew were 
Alison and Jenny, who were my 
editors. It did not look good. 

The Guardian changed after 
that trip, and ['m not just talking 
for me . Everyone could tell. 
Putting out UCSD's newspaper 
was always top priority, don't get 
me wrong. But the Guardian 
evolved into its own social scene as 
well . 

------j e ff r e y wh ite -- --

I put down my bag and started 
saying things, which I tend to do 
someti mes. "What's going on? I 
thought this was supposed a party! 
( low come all this booze is around 
and nobody's drinking it?!" 

Runco shoved a quarter-full 
handle of Jose Cuervo Especial at 
me and said something about 
putting my money where my 
mouth was. 

I grabbed the bottle and tilted it 
ba ck: Dh my God, I forgot how 
absolutely putrid this !.Tap is. Stay cool, 
Jrff. lhm are plople wauhing, and

... Hey, hrrw'd this glt empty sofast? 

I set the bottle down, wiped my 
mouth off on the shou lder of my 
fraternity rush T-shirt and looked 
around the room - apparently I 
had made a bit of an impression. 

200 1-200 I 

A year later, the next year's staff 
went back to Vegas. This time I was 
copy editor with Jenny, Alison was 
managing editor, and Joe had final-
ly come to his senses, ditched the 
busi ness office and 

decimating Cuervo bottles in front 
of a room full of strangers, and, not a 
year later, [ was surrounded by the 
greatest group of mends I could 
hope for. Maybe it was Vegas. Maybe 
it was the long production hours we 

spent together. 
hadgotten involved 
with the hiatus sec-
tion. h was on this 
trip that I got to 
mow Bill, Vince, 
Lauren and 
Crouse. 

Man, this was 
the tri p to end all 
trips. Bill and I 

They had secretly 
replaced all the 

fluids in my body 
with pure estrogen 

while I wasn't 
looking. 

Maybe we were all 
looking for each 
other. However it 
happened, .I will 
always look bad in 
wonder. 

As the year 
comes to a close, I 
should take this 
opportunity to say 

cleaned up at the 
Caribbean Stud tables. Norris 
debuted the Fuck Me Boots and we 
mercilessly wrestled for about 2.5 
tablespoons of vodka. (I drank it, 
but she claims victory on some sort 
of technicality.) Lauren revealed a 
side of her that none of us had ever 
seen - apparently she was a boy-
crazy, pumpkin-smashing lush. We 
lit Vince's face on fire . Sadly, 
Crouse let it ride one too many 
times. 

Somehow I had gone from proof-
reading articles in virtual isolation to 

Guardian 

some things to a 
few of my friends at 'the Gwn-dilm. 

Jenny, I once told you that you 
had the greatest laugh I'd ever 
hea.rd. I swear it's true. When 
you're smiling, it's impossible not 
to smile with you. 

Vince. Rain Man. To this day, 1 
have no idea how you were chief 
for an entire year and came out so 
squeaky clean. You'll have to teach 
me that trick sometime. You're the 
ultimate sport and you seem to 
have infinite patience - even when 
I decide it's time for 20 questions. 

s ta ff 

Carrie: We had some great 
times, didn't we babe? Clint and 
sushi at the same time - that' ll be 
tough to top. We'll hit up Ota again 
soon. Lock and load. 

Bill. Shlomo. It's funny: When I 
first met you, I never thought we'd 
be mends. You always set the high 
bar for hardcore. and you bet I 
treasure the fact that I'm the only 
monal to have ever defeated you at 
The Race. We've had some epic 
times, and we'll be in for some 
more when Deacon comes back to 
visit you in LA 

Lauren, working with you this 
year has been a pleasure. You did the 
job of twO people without flinching, 
and you somehow managed to avoid 
insanity after a year in the A-No 
Jelly LIC management unit- Kudos. 

Charlie, you owe me Starbuclcs. 
Mere's your head hat? 

Josh., you're holding the wheeL 
You are now personally responsible 
for keeping UCSD students 
infonned with reliable information, 
and entertained with weekly cross-
words. It's a privilege I feel lucky to 
have had, and I'm glad the 
Gutzrdilm will be in good hands for 
another year. The fez awaits you. 

Joe, I rallk our free one-day U2 
Vegas road trip as my top mu sica l 
experience. Thanks for that, and 
for all the times you listened. 
You're my partner in crime. 
Seriously, though . Contact me 
about that score this summer. 

With you Alison, I've finally 
met my match. At times, our never-
ending combat in and out of the 
office reached maddening intensity. 
Hasn't it been b'l'eat? I'll ne~'er for-
get watching the sun come up in 
the Berkeley hills with you and 
Vince the morning after your 21 st 
birthday. It was so beautiful -
especially the goats. 

There's a whole bunch of people 
I'd love to mention here, but I'm 
already over my word limit. To all of 
you, I say this (no, not that): Thank 
you. Working with every one of you 
has been a pleasure, and we all have 
reason to be proud of our newspaper. 
You've helped make my college expe-
rience complete, and helped me 
become the person [ am today - and 
believe me, I've come a long way. 

At the end ofJune, a bunch of us 
are going to meet up in Vegas for 
Alison's 22nd birthday. Come 
along. Tequila shots all around.

THURSDAY, JUNE 6,2002 THE UCSD GUARDIAN SPECIAL GRADUATION SECTION 87 

The 2002 San Diego fair to pay tribute to the king 
Rock and roll sound of Elvis Presley to permiate the fairgrounds at Del Mar 
By KEELY HYSLOP 
Staff Writer 

This summer, be sure to grab a "Hunk-a-Hunk-a Summer run" as the San Diego County 
Fair kicks off June 15 with its 2002 
theme: Elvis: A Tribute to the King 
of Rock & Roll. 

rormerly the Del Mar Fair, the 
fair will run through July 7. [t will 
be open weekdays from II a.m. to 
IOp.m. and on weekends from 10 
a.m . [0 11 p.m. 

This year's fair promises to 
showcase many old favorites 
,including the Innd annual exhibi-
tion of art, an open livestock com-
petition a flower and garden com-
petition and plenty of local craft 
venders. As evidenced by this year 's 
name change, the fair will also fea-
ture a few departures, such as the 
"Flying Elvi." 

Calling and Lifehouse, as well as 
Barry Manilow, Three Dog Night, 
Little Richard and The 
Temptations. 

There will also be the Steel 
Pulse Reggae Festival and a come-
dy show put on by Wayne Brady of 
"Mo's Line is it Anyway" fame . 

The fair will , appropriately 
enough, open with "Elvis, The 
Concert," featuring Elvis, semi -live 
on a giant video screen, performing 
his greatest concert hits with music 
played live by his original band and 
singers. 

Also on h~nd will be a huge 
selection of original Elvis memora-
bilia, enough to make any fan 
orcollector salivate. 

The 2002 San Diego County 
fair will be the first fair to be 
allowed by Elvis Presley 
Enterprises to exhibit Presley's 
motorcycles, velvet furniture , golf 
carts, concert costumes, the suit 
Elvis wore when he met President 
Nixon and his prize collection of 
law enforcement badges. 

First featured in the Nicolas 
Cage comedy "Honeymoon in 
Vegas," these parachuting Elvis 
impersonators will give an airborne 
performance, featuring fireworks 
and precision maneuvers. Upon 
reaching earth, will give an over-
the -top stage show, free with 
admission at the closing day of the 
fair. 

Interestingly enough, this 
event isn 't just a beloved commu-
nity event. It's also a histori c tradi-
tion. 

San Diego was only inhabited 
by a few thousand people, but the 
first annual San Diego County 
Horticultural and Agricultural 
D isplay was arranged by the 

Tyler HlIf/Guotdion 
Cominc Soon: The Del Mar Fairgrounds will host the annual San Diego County Fair (formerly the Del Mar Fair), which will 
attract Elvis fans and Elvis impersonators from across the county to this year's speaacular event 

The fair will also feature a 
diverse array of musi cal perfor-
mances including Pink, The 

National Ranch Grange Society

what is now National City's

By BRENT HECHT 
Staff Writer 

Students who must brave the barren desert tha t is the UCSD campus during the 
summer months will find an oasis 
of social life at Porter's Pub. The 
popular bar and all-ages restau-
rant, located in the Student 
Center, will welcome undergrads, 
graduate students and all other 
lonely campus stragglers from 11 
a.m . to 3 p.m. every Monday 
through Thursday. 

What's more, on Fridays the 
pub will help summer students kick 
off their weekends by keeping its 
doors open for its regular, school-
year hours. Porter's Pub's offerings 
are versatile - the menu includes 
sandwiches, appetizers, soups 
(many of which are vegetarian) and 
salads - and its atmosphere is

LAST ISSUE! 
The Guardian would like 

to thank all of our 
advertisers. Without 

university funding, The 
Guardian relies on local, 

national, and 
on-campus advertisers to 

provide UCSD and the 
surrounding communities 
with this award-winning 
newspaper. Also, each 

year, Guardian 
advertisers enable Triton 
students to gain valuable 

work experience for 
post-UCSD careers_ 

Journalism, Webl?age 
management, office & 

computer 
database maintenance, 

sales & marketing, 
distribution, illustration & 

photography are some 
areas wherein our student 

employees can gain 
hands-on training. For 

this, and for everything 
else, thanks!

OK, so maybe a lot of my 
Guardian memories do involve 
alcohol. But what do you expect 
from over-stressed college stu-
dents trying to respond to the 
impossible expectations of the 
reading audience? I think being 
an alcoholic is required to work at 
the Guardian. As my time and 
space quickly fade, I'd like to 
thank my fellow Guardianites. 
We've shared many stories, fast-
food meals, headaches, jokes, 
hopes, dreams, problems, drinks 
and memories. And I don't think 
there's enough alcohol in the 
world to erase all of those.

events will be later thcn usual , going from 
Aug. I through Aug. 4. Other days, includ-
ing the preview half day on July 31, are 
open to those payi ng for all four days and 
press only. 

To ask: " What is the Con?" is a decep-
tively simple question . Sure, ~here are 
plenty of booths from almo t every comic 
book company in America, but this event 
offers so much more . The massive 
Convention Center complex is utilized to 
provide many different events simultane-
ously. The entire lower floor will be the 

exhibit hall , which is a bazaar of so rtS. It 
will attract attention to new comic series 
and upcoming films, along with the sales 
and trade of a wide variety of merchandi e. 
If you want to buy anything from authentic 
medieval weapons, to collectable figures, to 
rare comics, the main hall holds a plethora 
of purchasable goods. 

As with every year, there is a spectacular 
array of celebrity speakers who give talks 
about their work. Among those making an 
appearance this year are Spike of pike &

awaited time: summer, when the glisten-
ing and sun-kissed gods and goddesses of 
Southern Ca lifornia flock to the seaside to 
pass away their idle hedonistic hours in 
revelry. 

And where can these pleasurCc-seekers 
go to fulfill their need for sun and adven-
ture? The answer lies in a wooden build-
ing that lies snugly in MIssion Bay Park 
and serves as the home for the largest 
instructional waterfront facility in the 
United States: the Mission Bay Aquatic 
Center. 

The Mission Bay quatic Center was 
founded in 1971 as a joint cooperative ven-
t\Jre by San Diego's colleges and universi-
ties, includi ng UC D and SDSU. The 
facility is open to all member of the colle-
giate comm\Jnity, staff, students, alumni and 
thei r families. For those unfortunate OllIs 
who find that they are not affiliated with a 
local university or college but would still 
like to partake in the activities, facilities and 
courses offered by the aquatic center, they 
must register with the SDSU College of 
E ·tended Studies. 

The impressive facility boasts a lounge 
with a fireplace, classrooms, shops, locker 
rooms with howers, dock, rowing center 
and numerous other amenities that probably 
mcan little to those unfamiliar to the aquat-
ic recreation scene. 

urrounding the wooden edifice are 

sunny, sandy beaches and green grassy lawns 
with picnic tables and barbeque areas. So if 
you aren't a fishing or boating aficionado, 
you can still enjoy the region with a picnic 
or gathering. In addition to these play areas, 
there are also sport facilities that include 
tennis courts, basketball courts and swim-
ming areas. 

Being partly funded by the California 
Department of Boating and Waterways, the 
Mission Bay Aquatic Center offers classes 
on boating safety and boating laws. For 
those interested in pursuing a career in 
cOl1lmercial boating (e.g. carrying passen-
gers), a U.S. Coast Guard captain's licensing 
course is also offered, designed by the 
Maritime Institute, Inc. 

For those novict;s wishing to experi-
ment with water sports and recreation , the 
aquatic center offers numerou classes 
from surfing to byaking; and even fishing, 
all at reasonable prices that can range from 
$25 to $90 for UCSD students. What can 
be more tantalizing than being taught the 
art of surfing by a fetching young instruc-
tor? 

Already a pro? Then fear not; rentals 
are offered at discount prices for students. 
They are available for one day (8 a.lll. until 
6 p.m.) or up to a week. Equipment avail-
able for walk-in rental includes surfboards 
(soft and fiberglass), wetsuits, body boards, 
kayaks , afety devices, wakeboard and 

"t'vlAD Magazine;" Todd M cFarlane, mak-
ing his first convention appearance in four 
years; creator of the intensely popular 
"Powerpuff Girl .. Craig M cCracken; and 
renowned sci- fi literary figure Ray 
Bradbury. 

One of the most intere ting visual events 
is the Masquerad e, in which people di play 
their larger-than-life and unquestionably 
spectacular cosrume designs. Each partici-
pant is given a few minutes to dazzle the 
audience with their presentation and the 
best is awarded a trophy and cash pri7.e. As 
one of the most widely-attended events at 
the Convention Center, seating is limited 
and a ticket is required. 

Popular sci-fi is always strong in pres-
ence, receiving its fair hare of merchan-
dise and fan support. Without fail , people 
attend as their favorite character, with 
Klingons getting the most frequent appear-
ance. People-watching is one of the most 
vibrant parts of the event. The most cos-
tumed people can be seen on Saturday -
the same day as the Masquerade Ball - but 
every day yields its own particular flavor of 
costumes. 

For anyone interested in many different 
aspects of pop culture, the annual event is 
the place to be - the unveilings, previews, 
freebies and freaks make for an unforget-
table time. Just be prepared to pay. 
Preregistration ends June 12 and full mem-
bership until then costs $55. One-day 
prices are considerably less, with some 
restrictions. For specifics about dates, 

water skis. For those who are more experi-
enced, after passing an orientation or tak-
ing a class on safety and use procedures on 
the equipement, more specialized equip-
ment is available for rent, including: sabots, 
lasers, kayaks, windsurfers and rowing 
wherries. 

Another facet of the aquatic center that 
might strike many as remarkable is that of 
the accessible water SpOrts. At the Mission 
Bay Aquatic Center, special classes in 
water skiing and freedom sailing have 
been adapted for people with disabilities 
so that anyone can participate in and 
enjoy water SpOrts. Outside of (hese two 
das e , which were formed pecifically for 
the disabled, anyone with disabilities is 
encouraged to register for any classes 
offered . 

So whether you arc looking to learn how 
to conquer the waves or just hang out and 
check out the horries in their natural habir-dt, 
Mission Bay Park offers all the facilities you 
could possibly imagine to tickle your fancy 
and keep you busy. To register for classes or 
for use of the facilities, stop by the Mi sion 
Bay Aquatic Center at 1001 Santa Clara 
Place, or call (858) 488-1036. For more 
information on classes, prices or to check

tors, check out the Web site at

Burning Man Festival 

In earch 
of the fasci -
nating and 
the entertain-
ing this sum-
mer? You 
needn't go far. 
The Burning 
M.an festival 
in Nevada's 
Black Rock 
Desert ( 120 

Kenriel< leung/Guardian miles north of 
Reno) is one of 

the nation's premiere pyrotechnic art festi-
vals. 

The festiva I is kicked off the weekend 
before the Labor Day and runs for about a 
week. Fantastic art display are provided by 
attending individuals, while the centerpiece 
of the festival is tile ever-growing Burning 
Man . ow standing nearly 40 feet tall, the 
Burning Man, which always burns the 
Saturday night before Labor Day, is an awe-
some spectacle in the desert night sky. 

The event, however, is not your typical 
conve ntion or fair. The fact that the event is 
completely commerce-free is evidence. The 
last few years, the four-sq uare-mile festival 
ha s drawn party-goers, bikers and others 
who live on the more extreme ends of life 's 
grand spectrum. Raves al 0 pop uJl all over 
what becomes a massive campsite. 

udity is a recurrent theme at the festi-
val, which for the most part requires one 
type of extreme look or another. While 
some will rap the ir bodies in police c,1ution 
tape and drip different colored waxes over 
their hair and face, others will choose to dis-
play the more natural artwork of the unal-
tered human form. 

But one thing is certain : Tho e at the fes-
tival do not take kindly ta students who 
show up wearing their favorite jeans and a 
college sweatshirt. I f you plan to make the 
trip , be su re to remember that people are 
no t encouraged to nttend the festival, they 
are encouraged to pm1icinte. 

Burning Man is a favorite for pyromani-
acs, photojournalists, exhibitionists and 
those who appreciate off-beat visual arts 
that our very own campus occasionally 
IIlcurs. 

This year's theme is "The Floating 
World." It runs from Aug. 26 to Sept. 2.

The Bourne Identity 

Starnng Matt Damon, Franka Po tente and Ju lia Stiles 

Plot: J ason Bourne has no memory. \\'hen his hullet-riddled bod\' washes ashore in the 
Mediterranean, Bourne ha s no idea W}lO he is . T he only thing to help him figure it out i, ,1 
microfilm implanted und er his skin . The film leads Bourne to a hank account and a nalile 
that could be his own, but marks him a wanted man and hil1t~ that he is a secret ag-c nt. 
Determin ed to out his true idemin'. Bourne emharks on a mis~ion to find hllm~ lr. A 

task that proves da~nting when armed forces would rather sec him 
dead. 

Outlook: Thi~ is ,\1<1 tt Damon ', fir~t action film. l Ie i .. aCCOl11p,l-
nied through tlle fast paced lhrill ride by Franka Potente ("Run Lola 

Run"), who has g iven up her neon hair to play tile role of Maric. The 
characte r of J ason Bourne is proficient in tile martial arts, but Damon, 
as Bourne, seems surpri sed every time he lets a punch fly. Potenre has 
retained some of her "Lola" grit and keeps up amicably with Damon 's 

attempts at a tough guy. Sadly, th e ro mance that flourishes between the two character, i, 
forced . udience hould look for exciting ca r chases and Julia Sti les as a computer wh iz.

Minority Report 

Starn'1g Tom CrUise, Cohn Farrell and Samantha Mor'tof'l 
Plot: In the funm.:, th ere cxi,p, the ca pabi lit} to catch criminal .. and charge them lor tTll11<:' 

that the), are about to cOlllmit. The system is considered perfect el'en by Chief 
Paul nderton (Cruise), who has made a career Out of jumping through roofs 
of unsuspecting funlre-criminals. But suddenly nderron himself is 
labeled a funlre criminal and tile hunter becomes the hunted. 
Suspecting foul pl ay by his colleague, conniving Danny \ Vitwer 
(Farrell), Anderton sets out to defend himself and prove tile system 
wrong. 

Outlook: This latest insta llment from the Spiclberg camp looks 
promising. T he "isual effects alone will draw audiences to the theater. 
The scene where Cmise jumps from one movin g space-vehicle to anoth-
er looks particularly breathtaking. The story al 0 has its attractive quali-
ties. There is the question, though, of ho\\ three people, partially sub-
merged in a large swimming pool, can ee Ihe future. Briti sh newcomer 
Samantha Morton plays one of rhe three clairvoyants and th e one who 
Cruise personali y chooses to he lp him escape life as a criminal. 
"Minority Report" will hopefully not be as daunting as "A. L" and just as good at "E.T." You 
may need a swimming pool full of psychics to tell you exactly how good, though.

Men In Black II 

Starring Will Smith, Tommy Lee jones and Lara Flynn Boyle 

Plot: The men in black are back. This sequel to the 1997 summer hi t reunites Agenl .l 
(Smith) wirh retired Agenr K Oones) as members of an excl usive government 
agency designed to keep tabs on extraterrestrials living on Earth. When a daunt-
ing task arises in the agency, Agent K has to be taken out of retirement a a U.S. 
postal clerk and be reinstated in the un ique force of inter-galactic crime fight-
ers. The team of Agents K and J find dlemselves up against (he beautiful 
Serleena (Boyle) , who is plotting a da ca rdly deed agai nst human kind . In 
order to foil Serl eena 's plan , K andJ pursue an investiga tion that brings them 
in contact with a host of outrageous character, all with their 0 \\11 intergalac-
tic quirks, including some that eat subway trains. 

Outlook: Will Smith should put a patent on the Jul y 4th weekend 
because, in th e past, h e has virtually owned it. This summer will probably 
be no different as audiences everywhere anxiously await the return of 

dynamic duo Agents K and J. Holding fast to the t raditi on of summer fun, 
"Men in Black 2" promi ses nothing deep besides a good belly- laugh. Fi ve 

years after the first "Men in Black," the ideas of ali ens amongst us i sti ll exciti ng. More 
interesting, though , is whether the chemistry between J ones and Smith still exists. 
Hopefully, Smith's familiarity with the role of J won't dampen his comedi c antics. 
Audiences will find Lara Flynn Boyle an interesting choice as an evil doer, complete 
with " bad mojo" and big hair. But let's face it, audiences are most exci ted to see Frank 
the talking pug. 

july 26 
Goldmember 

Starring: Mike Myers, Beyonce Knowles. Seth Green and Michael Caine 

Plot: "Goldmember" is Mike Myers ' final Austin Powcrs movie. In "Goldmembcr," Dr. 
Evil and Mini-M e have escaped from prison and align with the formidablc and flexible 
Goldmember (Myers) to hatch a plan for, YO\J guessed it: world domination . This timc, 
though, Dr. Evil plans to kidnap Austin Powers' fa tllCr, igel Powers (Caine). In order to 
save his father,· Powers must "re-connect" with old gi rlfriend FoXX)' 
Cleopatra (Knowles), who is a detective . The two sleuths then make their 
way around the world and through various decades to save the senior 
Powers and tile world. 

Outlook: Thi s final segment to the scries that has become 
internationally popular is on even par with the wackincs of the 
last two films. Mike Myers has decided to end the Austin Powers 
dynasty on a groovy nOte; no one should expcct less from the interna-
tional man of mystery. However, by taking on four parts for the film, 
Myers may be stretching h imself thin . The laughs, though , will sti ll 
corne from other arenas. The cast feanlres a va ri etY of celebrities, 
among them Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey and Brinic)' Spears, play-
ing themselve . Strangely enough, Katie Couric landed the part of a 
security guard. Audiences may be pleased to find out that Fat Bastard 
will re turn and Mini-M e i still played by Vern e Troyer. There will also be a ",v1.i ni -
Austin" incorporated into tile plot, who Troyer will also play. Despitc bringing old char-
acters back, "Gold member" will still spark enth usiasm with new personalitics such a\ the 
sexy Fook M i. The finale to ustin Power, ' adventures is sure to be goldcn foo l's gold.
