UCSD tumor research 

has been working on researching 
the issue of alternanve housing 
on campus Currently, they are 
conducti ng a survey to determine 
what students want in this type 
of housmg arrangement. The 
results of the survey will be used 
for several purposes: primarily, to 
determine how much students 
would be willing to pay for 
alternative housmg; econdly, It 
will be used to determine how 
many students would be 
interested in living in this 
housing, Thirdly, the results will 
be used to assist the committee 
m preparing and writing a 
comprehensive and thorough 
proposal to be presented to the 
administration at the end of the 
year. 

A team of researchers at the 
UCSD School of Medicme has 
developed a technique for 
growing human tumors in the 
laboratory that take on the same 
three-dimensional fonn and 
genetiC make-up of cancer 
growing inSide a patient. 

Culturing tumors in the lab so 
that they resemble malignacies 
inside the body will allow 
researchers to study human 
tumor growth. 

A plastinaccJ brain was one of the missing organs from BSB. 

This advance was made in the 
laboratory of Robert M. Hoffman, 
Ph.D. , a member of the UCSD 
Cancer Center. Hoffman and his 
associates repon the successful 
growth in culture of 75 percent 
of all human tumors tested. 

Missing parts from med school 
Presently, two potential sites 

have been located for the 
purpose of alternative housing. 
The area north of the Institute of 
the Americas, and the 
soccer/ playing field on the 
southwest side of Torrey Pines 
Road, across from Revelle 
College. 

Also, representatives from the 
committee will be doing more 
research in the areas of 
financing, architecture', house 
organization and management, 
leases with the university and 
other issues that will be used to 
draft the proposal. The 
committee win begin drafting ilie 
proposal winter quarter so that 
they can begin working with the 
administration and faculty 
regarding the logistics of the 
project. 

The survey asks questions 
about students' group 
arrangements, objectives and

BLOOM COUNTY 

Olher attempts have been 
made to grow tumors in culture, 
but the new technique has a 
much higher success rate than 
previously reponed . 

·We obtained tumor 
specimens from almost 200 
cancer patients in San Oiego, 
mosdy from Sharp Hospitals and 
Scripps dinic and Research 
Foundation and planted them in 
the laboratory on collagen-
containing gels," Hoffman 
explained. 

If his research proves 
successful, Hoffman says doctors 
may be able to test experimental 
cancer treatments on tuinors in 
culture before ilie drugs are given 
to patients. This could spare 
cancer patients from' unnecessary 
reactions to experimental 
treatments and could also 
minimize the number of animals 
used for testing new cancer 
drugs .

A HUMAN brain, spinal cord, skull and pelvis were stolen from the 
display case on the first floor of 
the ~ic Science Building (85B) 
the morning of Tuesday, Jan. 21 , 
a UC50 Museum official said. 

The specimen, to be used in a 
neurology class next quaner, was 
lifted from the case between 
Sunday, Jan. 19 and 8 am 
Tuesday, Jan. 21 , Bill Collins, 
senior museum scientist at SSB, 
said. 

Police have no word on the 
suspeCtS, bi.1t they guess that the 
specimen is somewhere on 
campus, Collins said . 

"It's very strange to me. My 
.only guess ... is that it's sitting in 
someone's bedroom, sitting on 
the shelf for shock value," he 
added . 

The brain and spinal cord, 
because they were preserved by a 
rare process known as 
planstination, were the most 
valuable pans of the display,

"My hope is that somebody at 
the end of the semester will 
return it because we were reaDy 
counting on this specimen for 
basic neurology this year and it's 
gone," he said. 

Planstination, developed in' 
Heidelberg, Germany in 1979, is 
an inexpensive means of 
preserving specimens (human 
organs) ~d for medical courses, 
Collins said . 'The process, new to 
the United States, promises to be 
"the wave of the future" because 
of its advantages over traditional 
means of preservation which 
involve formaldehyde, he added. 

The process, reqUiring silicon 
impregnation, allows for 
flexibility, long life and safe 
handling of the specimen, 
Collins said. 

" feel by ·the year 2000, med 
schools, of any good size and 
quality, will have a planstination 
lab because of the beauty of what 
planstination is," he said.

"You have a specimen iliat you 
can carry around, that can 
handle without the worry of ilie 
smeU, the initation to the e~s or 
the skin. You don't have the 
specimen drying out ... and as 
far as we know, it ·williast 
forever: he added. 

Collins, a native of La Jolla, 
started as a truck driver at UCD 
16 ~ars ago. When ilie medical 
school was looking for "someone 
with a strong back" to work with 
med students in the different 
labs, Collins was chosen. 

"I'm really a product of on-me-
job training: he added. 

Collins, one of the 20 
planstination experts in the 
COunlry, is responsible for 
planstinating all the specimens 
in the Libo Collection, an 18-
year-old special collection of 
human organs at BSB for second-
~ar medical students. 

"We've gOt everything (at 
UC50) ... I'm .excited to become 
the expert here in California," he 
added . ~

E. Margaret Burbidge, PhD, discusses possible setbacks to UC research. D R.E. MARGARET BURB[DGE appeared shaken at a press 
conference Tuesday afternoon as 
she and coUeague Bill Baity 
discussed the future of 
University of California space 
projects, follOWing the 
catastrophic explOSion of the 
space shuttle Challenger earlier 
that morning. 

NASA received no telemetry 
indication there was any 
problem aboard the Challenger 
(NASA's 25th shuttle launce), 
thus the cause of the explosion 
may never be positively 
idenrified , Baity said. Apparently 
it was the main liquid 
hydrogen/ oxygen fuel tank that 
exploded. "You couldn't ask for a 
more explosive mixture," he said, 
"They're the very worst kind of 
materials to be involved in an 
accident." 

AS press pass questioned 
By MATI CRONIN, Opinions Editor 

Burbidge, urtlversity professor 
and director of the UCSD Center 
for Astrophysics and Space 
SCience (CASS), said there were 
"some teaTS (and) just general 
shock" following news of the in-
flight explosion of the shutde, 
which killed aU seven people on 
board . Burbidge Iamenred "the 
loss of lives of those very. brave 
astronauts," one of whom, 
Sharon Christa McAuliffe, was to 
be the fiTSt civilian in space. 

Baity said ilie explOSion was a 
double loss for CASS, whose 
Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS) 
was scheduled to be Iaunced 
with the Hubble Space Telescope 
in an October shuttle mission. 
The Space Telescope also 
depends on the data handling of 
two TDRS (Tracking and Data 
Relay Satellites) satellites, one of 
which was aboard the 
Challenger. Baity, project 
manager for sciences for FOS, 
said he expects the shuttle 

"There are millions of pieces 
in the shuttle," Baity said. "All it 
takes is for something to go 
wrong with a few of them ... 
people had been mentioning the 
possibility of catastrophe (for 
some time). But 1 would go on 
the next shuttle. 1 would jump at 
the chance," he said. 

FOS is a device designed to 
record the radiation spectrum of 
faint celestial objects which are 
some of the oldest things in the 
universe, according to Burbidge. 
It is the most sophisticated 
spectrograph of aU time, she 
said. Roughly the size of a phone 
booth, the $)0 miUion-plus FOS, 
whose development was begun 
in 1977, is designed to take 
advantage of the tremendous 

J [LL L1FSCHIZ, AS vice preSident of financial affairs, obtained a pass to Bishop 
Desmond Tutu's 

speech in the UCSD s0n last 
Thursday. 

Responding to questions as to 
why she was sitting in the front 
row of the press section during 
the address, Lifschiz said, "I 
asked the Public Infonnation 
Office whether or not I could go 
as a member of the media, and 
there was no problem. I have a 
lot of pull, you know." 

Paul Lowenberg, who was in 
charge of ticket sales for the 
event at P[O. was unfamiliar with 
the AS officer's name. "Any 
member of the press had to 
display proper identification to 
get a media badge (at the door)," 
he said. Susan Pollick, PIO 
representative in charge of press 
passes at the gym's entrance, 
said, ·We checked all credentials 
for the press at the door."

Another member of the press 
said her credentials were not 
checked . She simply stated the 
name of the newspaper she 
represented and received her 
pass. 

There was no time to 
investigate the validity of the 
credentials at the event, 
Lowenberg said. "There were so 
many people coming (to Tutu's 
speech) from aU over the area. [f 
someone coud provide the 
necessary identification. then 
(s)he got in," said Lowenberg. 

Questioned as to why she did 
not obtain a ticket in her full 
capaCity as a member of the AS 
Council, Lifschiz said, "[ thought 
that if I gave up my ticket via the 
AS, and we were given 20, you 
know, that someone else would 
go in my place: 

Lifschiz was asked if she had 
considered iliat her going as a 
member of the media might not 

exclude a real member o( the 
media which already had been 
limited as to the number of 
passes they could obtain. 
Lifschiz said, "I don't know, I 
never thought of it that way." 

Lifschiz claimed she was 
asked by the La Jolla. Forum to 
attend the evenr as part of their 
staff. Eric Rupley, one of the ne"" 
editors of the Forum, was Sitting 
next to Lifschiz. When Rupley 
was asked if this was true, he 
said, "I don't know." 

Rupley was then asked a 
second time if'he had invited 
the AS vice president to 
represent tiis newspaper. ·Well, I 
don't know, [ don't know what to 
say; I'll say 'possibly.' That's right, 
I will say 'possibly,"' he said.

The AlA: McCarthyism rises again 
It all sounds so familiar - monitoring 

people's views and labeling them as either 
·'right' or 'wrong: Accuracy in Academia (AlA) 
arrived 30 years too late. It would have fit in 

. nicely with the rhetoric of Senator Joseph 
McCarthy and his red scare, uAre you now, or 
have you ever been, a member of the 
communist party?" These are the words that 
scar modem American history. We look back 
at that period in disbelief, wondering how 
such a paranoia over communism could have 
gained such power. Why was it allowed to eat 
up the innocent lives of so many, for simply 
refUSing to answer that question , for 
themselves, or for anyone they may have ever 
been associated with? 

Now a new organization, AlA, comes along 
and sings the same rune , claiming that 
today's professors are too leftist to supply 
students with an 'accurate' and balanced 
education. To bring about what they claim to 
be the conservative balance, AIA is exposing 
the Marxists and leftists in their newsletters 
and is sending letters to department heads 
and newspapers. 

The members of AlA, who by no means 
represent this nation's true conservatives, 
have every right .to disagree with the method 
and content of a professor's lectures, but by 
avoiding direct confrontation and debate in 
the open forum of the classroom they 
jeop~rdize the experimentation and exchange 
of ideals that this counny's educational 
system is built upon. 

It seems odd that several 18 or 19 year-
olds might have the power and ~ackground . 

DOONE58URY 

to dictate what a PhD should or should not 
teach. We can only wonder what effect this 
new 'red scare' could have on new professors, 
if it will curb wary students from asking 
controversial questions, and whether the 
trend will catch on. 

Nothing good comes QUt of ignorance and 
the exclusion of controversial ideas. Learning 
is based on an unconditional freedom to 
express oneself. Only then can we all benefit 
from our 'higher' educational experience. 

IY GARRY 

It's all a very transparent method of 
intimidation, so much so that it is easy to 
think that AlA will just go away, but our 
recent history dictates otherwise. Cop)'ri&hl 1986, G.B.Trudeau. Reprinrcd with penndsion al Uni~rso1 Press Syndicallt. All rilhls rrserwd. 

The infallible dream is blown apart 
When the space shuttle Challenger blew 

apart into little pieces on Tuesday, so did our 
almost two-decade long dream of being the 
infallible conquerors of space. Our generation 
has grown up with the space program -
from the moon walkers to icy boulders 
speeding about with the ring~ of a Uranus 
moon - so we are a part of us successes 
and failures . Tuesday morning, January 29, 
may be forever etched in our memories as a 
lesson in the potency of mass hysteria. For as 
we witnessed countless television clips of our 
"new frontier" exploding in the morning light, 
we began, once again, a national period of 
mourning. Those far away horizons where we 
yearn to stamp our imprint may have to wait 
another century now, as fear is slowly rising. 

Scientists are fond of dwelling in 
astrological hypotheses, at least during the 
times when concrete facts are too elusive to 
grasp. They h'ave enabled the more 
eanhbound creatures among us to gaze into 
the universe of space; and to wonder, and to 
hope, and to caluclate , whether there is a 
better tomorrow elsewhere in the galaxy. 
They, along with some authors and 
filmmakers of the same bent, bring us away 

from the miserable realities of our own planet, 
Earth, and lend us a fresh focus on the 
reason(s) for being: That is probably why 
NASA maintains an amazing amount of 
support within the private sector. That is also 
the reason that NASA has convinced the 
public sector time and time again that their 
agency deserves a multi-million dollar budget. 
Most importandy though, the aura of . 
unfathomable wisdom that uspace" exudes 
upon us most likely led Judith A. Resnick, 
(one of the astronauts who perished in 
Tuesday's explOSion), to demand of the NASA 
community to "Get me into space before I'm 
an old woman." 

That phrase uttered by Judith exemplifies 
how our nation, fleeing from its own vicious 
realities since John Kennedy rhetorically 
launched us into a new era of discovery, has 
felt about its own planet. There appears to be 
almost a pervasive stigma attached to 
cleaning up your own backyard these days on 
Earth. For instead of conquering our own 
destiny, we decided to venture out into the 
unknown, first. Finally, we have suffered 
because of it. 

The mass media will call this technological 

accident a "tragedy" forevermore . They, of 
course, are speaking of the entire event. We 
would prefer to separate the event into two 
parts: the tragic loss of human life, 'and the 
technological accident. As it happens, 
machines frequently get the best of the ' 
people who work within them. Not to 
overlook the other side of the galaxy, 
however, is how the massive universe got the 
best of our most advanced technology. 

We will continue as a species to reach out 
and explore the unknown; we can expect at 
times to feel the brunt of our lack of wisdom. 
We must push forward, though, with the 
greatest amount of speed, in an attempt to 
find the answers that so elude us. But are the 
answers in space? We tend to believe that the 
end of the rainbow is here on our own 
planet, and the millions of schoolchildren' 
who watched the Challenger crew perish will 
hopefully grow up and believe the same. For 
we have lightyears of work to accomplish 
here on planet Earth before we begin sending 
civilians into space; the forces .of the wild 
blue yonder showed NASA just how 
much. ~ 

LfTTfHSlUTfHSLuTfHSlHTffiSlfTTfHSLHTfHSluTffiSluTfHsLnifHslnTffisLfl 
Liberal courts 
Editor: 

Peter Quercia's commentary of 
1/9/ 86, in which he blames 
conservative groups for the 
existence of the death penalty, 
and in which he announces his 
support for Rose Bird, deserves 
rwo comments. 

First, if Mr. Quercia had done 
some researCh, he would have 
found that the vote in the 1972 
death penalty decision was five 
to [our, reversing the death 
penalty. But, of the five voting to 
reverse, only rwo felt that the 
death penalty was inherently 
cruel and unusual , while the 

other th ree felt that the 
consistently capricious manner 
in which death sentences were 
handed down was duel and 
unusual. (Mmorines were being 
singled out for execution.) 
Clearly, then, only two of the 
nine justices felt that the death 
penalty could never be aUowed 
(even though the Fifth 
Amendment acknowledges that 
capital offense do, In fact . exist), 
while the other seven felt that it 
might be aUowed under some 
conditions. Thus, it should be no 
significant surprise that in 1976, 
the court voted seven to two that 
the death penalty was not 
inherently cruel and unusual, 

and that it would be aUowed if 
not applied capriciously. Yet Mr. 
Quercia is surprised by the 1976 
ruling, and insists on blaming 
conservative groups for inducing 
·change" in the court'S position , 
though there was no actual 
change in position. 

Second, Mr. Quereia states that 
the radical right has "[ madel 
political ideology, not 
experience, the primary criterion 
for nomination and subsequently 
appointment to a federal or state 
judgeship." But when Rose Bird 
was chosen by Jeny Brown, 
though she had practiced law for 
II years, she had no experience 
as a Judge. Would it be 

unreasonable to require that a 
Supreme Court justice have some 
experience as a judge so that he 
or she could appreCiate the 
efforts and responsibilities of a 
judge, especially since we give 
the justice the power to overturn 
lower court decisions? IronicaUy. 
though Mr. Quercia supports 
Rose Bird , application of his test 
for experience would result in 
her removal from the Supreme 
Court. It is unfortunate, but Mr. 
Quercia's excessive use of liberal 
rhetoric diminishes the 
credibility of his entire 
commentary.

As rhetoric seeps in, so goes the nation 
By KATHY BECKETI, Staff Writer 

One of the most powerful 
weapons wielded by Presidem 
Reagan is his ability to persuade 
the pUblic of the morality and 
rectitude of his rolicieS. His 
successful use 0 rhetoric 
illustrates the importance of 
ideology as a cohesive force in 
modem society. Although 
Reagan 's superior skiU in the art 
of "communication" has earned 
him great distinction, he is not 
alone in the war of words that 
engages aU politicians. Emulation 
of their leader, however, has 
meant that an exceptionaUy 
potent tool has been added to 
the arsenal of nco-conservatives: 
the ability to repeatedly and 

convincingly associate their 
policies wTth Widely accepted 
values. Problems that rightly 
concern the majority of American 
are addressed, and a solution 
that conveniently fits into their 
proposed framework is preferred. 

Examples of such iUusory 
connection berween poliCies and 
values abound . PhyUis Schafly 
has proposed as pan of her 
"Eagel Platform" a "war against 
child abuse." Although the tide of 
this campaign is appealing, it is 
also quite misleading. This "war" 
does not consist of the provision 
of shelter or counseling for 
victims of child abuse , nor does 
it propose any research that

directly associated with cigarette 
smoking. Ahnost another 200 
persons will have succumbed to 
other choronic diseases 
indirectly linked to smoking. 

Nearly 350,000 men and 
women in the United States will 
nO{ live to see New Year's Day 
1987, having literally died for a 
smoke during 1986. Six times 
more Americans die each year 
from smoking-related diseases 
than are kiDed in motor vehicle 
accidents. More American Ii~s 

ha~ been lost in the the first 
half of this decade because of 
smoking than died in aU the 
wars fought since the American 
Revolution over 200 years ago. 
That's 1.75 milion premature 
deaths or nearly enough to equal 
every rnan, woman and child 
living in San Diego County, the 
second most populous county in 
California. Were private 
enterprise not the culprit in this 
holocaust then the govemment 
would have by now declared that 
a plague . had visited this great 
nation, and an aU-out effort 
would now be underway to 
eradicate the epidemic. 

The economic repercussions 
in trying to treat smoking-related 
maladies is equally as staggering 
as the death too\. In 1985, 
victims - including taxpayers 
who support governmem-paid 
health programs - shelled out 
over $13 billion in an attempt to 
cure sick smokers. Of that 
amount nearly half was born by 
the victim's employers. A study 
by Seattle University'S Albers 
Graduate School found that 
employers spend an average of 
54,000 a year extra on employees 
who smoke, in comparison to 
what, is normaUy expended on 
non-smoking employees. A 
typical smokers absentee rate is 
2.2 days a year more than the 
figure for non-smokers, and 
medical benefits paid by the 
employer to smoking employees 
is 59 percent higher than that 
used by non-smokers. An 
estimated 80 million work days 
are lost annually because of 
employee illnesses that are 
directly attributable to cigarette 
smoking. 

Astonishingly, the federal 
government provides tobacco 
farmers with subsidies totaling 
upward~ of 5850 million a year, 
thanks to the effons of the 
tobacco company lobbyists and 
influential politicians like Sen. 
Jesse Helms of North Carolina. 

But, if people want to transform 
their bodies into the equivalent 
of a toxic waste dump, shouldn't 
that be their right? After all, isn't 
this what America is supposed to 
be all about, the freedom to live 
one's life as one sees fit? 

Certainly it is the individual's 
right to squander his or her 
birthright by smoking should 
they 50 choose; however, there is 
no provision for anyone 
impinginlt this freedom on 
innocent bystanders. For 
example, recent research 
conducted by the National 
Institute of Environmental Health 
Sciences found that the more 
time a non-smoking person 
spends around a smoker the 
greater the chances for that non-
smoker to develop cancer. Non-
smokers living or working 
around a smoking adult face a 
cancer risk I. 4 times higher than 
for those persons who don't 

spend long periods of time 
around a smoker. Being around 
two smokers increases the cancer 
risk by 2.3 times, with three 
smokers, 2.6 times. 

In addition, the non-smokers' 
chances of contracting other 
smoking-related diseases such as 
leukemia, emphysema and breast 
cancer, which now strikes a 
record 1 woman in 11, is gready 
enhanced in proportion to the 
amount of time the non-smoker 
spends with a smoker. This is 
because the sidestream, or 50-
caUed "passive" smoke emanating 
from a smoker's Cigarette is 
actually higher in certain 
carcinogenic substances than 
what is willingly bei ng inhaled 
by the smoker. At this moment 
the rights of smokers to indulge 
in their habit is taking 
preference over the rights of 
non-smokers to enjoy a healthy, 
clean environment. Until this 
changes, both smokers and non-
smokers shaU continue sulTt'TIng 
similar consequences. 

would induce a more complete 
understanding of the causes of 
child abuse. No, the "war against 
child abuse" is an acronym for 
the prohibition of any material 
that describes the eVents of the 
holocaust in elementary and high 
schools. Under the guise of 
concern for the most vulnerable 
of American society marches a 
most blatant form of censorship. 

Similarly, the student group 
known as Accuracy in Academia 
obfuscates its real intention 
behind the misleading term 
accuracy. This group is not 
concerned with the correctness or 
precision of material taught at 
univerSities, rather, it has 
deemed itself to be the rightful 
judge of the "approrriateness" of 
educational materia . The 
economic and social theories of 
Karl Marx, one of modem 
SOCiety'S most relevent and 
provocative thinkers, have been 
termed by the AlA "anu-
American" and therefore 
"inappropriate." 

President Reagan often appeals 
to the concept of "the family;" 
Americans are not told that 
programs designed to 
"strengthen the family" include 
the abolition of abortion. The 
high value placed on freedom in 

our society is also manipulated 
as Reagan inaccurately terms the 
contra terrorists, whom he wants 
Congress to fund , "freedom 
fighters." 

Opponents of divestment, 
largely major investors in South 
Africa, have cleverly attempted to 
justify their suppOrt of the 
repugnant system of apartheid by 
equIvocating their contribution to 
the system with increased 
opporrunities and welfare for the 
blacks. Many of the opponents of 
apartheid have been successfuUy 
deluded with respect to the role 
of foreign investors by these 
firms apparent concem for the 
well-being of thp C:;outh Africans. 
Peop)e are chaUenged to reaffirm 
their faith in freedom and 
democracy by supporting one of 
the most brutal and repressive 
governments in the world . 

Politcal rhetoric is powerful 
and seductive. Its tendency to 
paint the world in simplistic 
terms of dichotomies is aided by 
the news media's superficial and 
dramatized coverage of "events," 
which further obscures the 
complexity of political and social 
situations. In an alarming 
exemplification of George 
OrweU's doublespeak, the MX 
missUe has beel) dubbed the 

"peacekeeper"; the media often 
picks up on such labels, and 
without any consideration of 
their suitability, bombards the 
public with their repeated use. 

By depicting world affairs in 
terms of the East-West conflict, 
with, of course, the Soviet Union 
representative of aU evil and 
aggression, any desire for social 
change, no matter how justified, 
is delegitimized. Proponents of 
such change are immediately 
IabeUed "communist," and are 
considered violent and 
subversive by nature. The term 
"national security" derives its 
potency from the prevelant 
desire to live in an environment 
safe from such aggression; it is 
used, however, to Justify 
spending vast sums of money on 
a "defense" budget that has 
greatly contributed to the huge 
defiCit, and that has rendered 
the 'United States no more secure 
than it was 30, 20 or 10 years 
ago. 

The belief in freedom does nO{ 
imply support for the contras or 
oppositions to divestment; the 
desire for seeurity does not entail 
the advocation of huge military 
expenditure. The connection 
between these values and these 
policies is illusory. 

Space's remarkable ones 
By ROBERT LEONE, St4ff Wnttr 

Two days ago, around nine in 
the morning, I heard that Space 
Shuttle Challenger had exploded 
in flight. I think ru remember 
where I was, and what I felt, for 
the rest of my life. But we 
should've expected it. After all, 
nineteen years and a day before 
the shuttle launch, Roger B. 
Chaffee, Virgil Grissom and 
Edward H. White died in an 
Apollo Spacecraft test. On April 
24th, 1965, Vladimir J<omarov 
died when the parachute 
shrouds of his spacecraft snarled. 
In 1971, three Russian 
Cosmonauts whose names I have 
been unable to find yet, died 
when the air leaked from their 
capsule. And now, we can add 
Gregory JalVis, Christa McAuliffe, 
Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, 
Judith Resnik, Francis Scobee 
and Michael Smith to the list lIf 
astronauts and cosmonauts 
who've died on board a 
spacecraft. But that's just the tip 
of the iceberg if we wish to 
know 'the price, (in blood), of 
the exploration of space. 

How many people have died 
in training? How many have 
died constructing th gantries, 
working with the chemicals, 
bUilding the spacecraft? How 
many have not died but were 
maimed and injured? What price 
in lives and heattli ha~ we paid 
already? What orice wiD we 
continue to pay? 

Why do we pay such a price? 
Of course, our species has 

always been wiDina to pay the 
price. NO{ coUectively, but there 
seem to always be individuals 
wiDing to risk their lives and • 
fortunes in some inhospitable or 
unknown region. Consider, if you 
would, the history of the Arctic 
exploration and the search lor 
the northwest passage. In 1845, 
Sir John Franklin commanded an 
English naval expedition to 
search for the northwest passage 
and explore the Artie seas. He 

and many of his officers and 
men were veterans of polar 
expeditions. His ships, the 
Erebus and Terror, originaUy built 
as sturdy bomb kedges, had been 
so reinforced for ice work that 
they may have been the tOughest 
wood ships ever built. The other 
equipment was more than 
adequate. None returned to 
England. 'jet Luke Foxe, 

comm~nding the Charles , did not 
lose a single life in his 1631 
expedition to northern Canadian 
waters. These were, and still are, 
the breaks. 

Sometimes the breaks go the 
wrong way, and people die . And 
you can rest assured that for 
whatever reason, be it commerce, 
altulstic exploration. glory. 

military advantage or simple 
curiosity, there will be more 
people in space. And that more 
people will die in space. 

Yuri Gagarin, the firs! man in 
space. may have known this best 
At Vladimir Komarov's imerment 
he said "There has never been a ' 
bloodless victory over nature. We 
have just begun to explore space 
in the vicinity of Earth. But who 
can deny that our earthlings' 
discoveries have been paid for 
by ,~he lives of remarkable people 

AbOUt a year later, Gagarin 
died during a training flight for 
his next space mission. He was a 
remarkable person. They all were 
remarkable people. ~

Charlene Miller Drennon 

To Dave from Spain 

Editor: 
An open letter to President 
Gardner, 

As University of California 
students panicpating in the 
Education Abroad ~rogram in 
Madrid , Spain, we would like to 
express our extreme 
disappointment and distress over 
the fact that you and the Board 
of Regents have nOl yet divested 
U.c. funds from corporations 
doing business in South Africa. 

As Nonh Americans living in 
Spain we are confronted on a 

daily basis with the 
consequences of our country's 
foreign poicy. The United States' 
close economic and political ties 
with South Africa are in no way 
justifiable as the apattheid 
system runs counter to the very 
morals and social principles our 
country espouses to uphold. 
U.C.'s $2.4 billion invested in 
South Africa implies similar 
hypocrisy and the Regents' 
refusal to divest implicates their 
indirect suppon for the 
apattheid government. 

The University of California as 
an educational instituion is 
responsible for encouraging the 
development of new ideas and 
promoting a greater under-
standing of the world and its social 
and political institutions. 
Apanheld In ~U{h Alrica is 
clearly an unacceptable form of 
government that contradicts all 
intelligent understanding of 
human justice. The government 
of South Africa directly supports 

discrimination and oppression 
and the situation clearly 
demands condemnation. 
Although the University of 
California has the ability to make 
a statement that would be heard 
worldwide and thereby promote 
change, it has chosen nor to do 
so. 

The University of California 
has a world reputation for 
excellence in the realm of theory 
(a reputation that we've 
encountered with much pride 
here in Spain); yet. in practice 
its continued policy of investing 
in South Africa is diametrically 
opposed 10 all of the eloquent 
lectures about foreign policy and 
world peace that students so 
often hear. How can those who 
propose to teach future 
generations be so respected 
when their actions run counter 
to the most basic elements of 
social justice? 

The situation for all people 
living in South Africa has 
continued to worsen since the 
Regents decided in June nor to 
take any positive action. 

The world has been witness to

the increased killing of blacks in 
Soweto and other townships. The 
press has been banned from 
covering the uprisings and the 
resulting brutal oppression by the 
government and this clearly 
demands condemnation. The 
University of California's 
continued investments in South 
Africa make the university an 
accomplice to all of these 
actions. It is a shame that those 
responsible for education in 
California - the U.c. Board of 
Regents - have nor taken the 
most essential step to recognize 
the needs and genuine 
aspirations of the South African 
people , and have instead used 
their power to impede their 
liberation. 

Finally, while we are not 
currently in California, we would 
like to extend our solidarity and 
suppon to all students, facudy 
and staff who are working for 
divestment.

that are "poorly balanced" or 
"pro-MarxiSt. .. 

Some conservative groups have 
objected to AlA's tactics. "Making 
students the monitors of their 
teachers is a wrong-headed and 
harmful way 10 deal with the 
problem. It does not bring true 
academic and intellectual 
Ireedom back to the classroom 
but only perpetuates the assault 
on such freedom - from the 
other side." said Midge Decter, 
head of the Conservative 
Committee for the Free World in 
a December 1985 editorial of 
Contentions. 

"Accuracy in Academia's 
tactics are a watered-down 
version of Hider's Germany, 
where children were trained to 
inform on their parents and 
instructors," said Kyle McCreary, 
chairman 01 the Young 

Conservative Alliance of America 
in their Jan . 10, 1986 new 
release. 

"This is nOlhing less than a 
clear violation of civil libetties. 
Our fundamental objection to 
AlA is that they violate the 
constitutional principle of the 
right of people to face their 
accusers in aJ'ublic forum," 
McCreary sai . 

Other conservatives fear the 
"brainwashing of students and 
the decline of Western society, if 
conservative ideology is not 
addressed on campus. 
Conservatives see the university 
as a stronghold of leftist theories, 
according to Chris Alario of the 
California Review, UCSD's 
conservative journal. 

"Cenainly, on many campuses, 
there is a problem of bias against 
conservative opinion. But the 
issue should not become this or 
that individual professor. The 

issue is lack of balance in a 
depanment or university: the 
dominance of one point of view 
at a place. This problem is best 
resolved from Within, by effdns 
to establish balance and diversity 
of opinion. It is not resolved by 
seeking to mount publiC 
campaigns against individual 
professors." said WiUiam J. 
Bennett, Secretary of the 
Depanment of Education. 

Professors under AlA attack 
have been John Womack, 
Harvard Latin American 
historian, Sam Bowles, a 
University of Massachusetts 
economist, political scientist 
Howard linn of Boston 
University and panicularly Dr. 
Mark Reader, a political scientist 
at Arizona State University. The 
only action taken against these 
professors, according to the AlA's 
Campus Report has been the 
write-up of AlA accusations in 

the monthly newspaper. 
A1A, has publicly criticized 

over nine professors, according 
to the Campus Report. 

Several months ago, Accuracy 
in Academia listed Zinn as a 
kind of faculty AlA might want to 
monitor. 

linn sees AlA as a "secretive 
organization" employing "police 
tactics." 

"What is actually dangerous is 
not the actual monitOring, but 
the atmosphere of fear for 
younger, insecure professors 
seeking tenure and fearing a 
'McCanhy blacklist,'" linn said 
in a January 20, 1986 inverview. 
AlA may send a letter criticizing 
the professor to the univerSity 
president or depattment head. 

As an already tenured 
professor, Zinn said he plans to 
continue teaching controversial 
issues. 

linn also fears college 
studems may hesitate to speak 
out in class for fear of being 
sin2led out. After discussing AlA 
in one of linn's classes, a 
foreign student said that he felt 
threatened to voice his opinion

in class and feared he might 
consequently lose his visa and be 
de~oned. In general, lilln's 
students felt that an outside 
agency should not monitor 
courses, he said. 

linn feels that AlA does not 
promote "accuracy" or neutral 
ideplogy, but is interested in 
"limiting discussion" and 
"discouraging ideas" critical of 
those that the AlA favors, such as 
ultra-nationalistic, American 
foreign policy. 

"Accuracy in Academia has no 
place in academia. The people 
running AlA have no credentials 
to monitor academia. They have 
broken the truSt bond between 
faculty and students. People can 
no longer feel free to 
spontaneously generate ideas," 
linn said. 

"AlA intrudes into a place that 
it is not entitled to imrude into 
because it is a special interest 
group. AlA assumes that there is 
no room for error in the 
university. But mistakes are 
functional and help strengthen 
truths which are not fully

Watching for Halley's

2)with telescopes; or 3)on T-

Au th or/ physicist has 
unique approach to life 
By EMMA-LEE CAPRIO 
"Y OU WOULDNT believe it when talking 

to me, but I'm one of 
those flamboyant teachers," said 
David Brin, a UCSD graduate 
and teacher of physics and 
creative writing. "I throw chalk at 
srudents if they're asleep: Brin 
continued, "If some guy comes 
up with a sarcastic - but correct 
- answer, I throw him a video 
token as a reward: . 

In his mid-30s, David Brin 
has a PhD in physics and is 
currently a consultant on various 
NASA projects for the California 
Space Instirute. "Largely because 
physics was hard for me as an 
unders:ad: Brin said , "I fought 
very hard to be a physicist." He 
sympathizes WIth physics 
students today. "When I'm 
teaching physics, I can 
remember very well what places 
were difficult and I can show the 
students new tricks or angles." 

Brin, who has written many 
novels and has won twO Hugo 
awards, one for his novel Star/ide 
RiSing and one for a short story 
from a collectlon called The River 
of Time (which will be completed 
within the year) loves teachin~ 
creative writing. "When teaching 
creative writing, I can teach a lot 
of mings ," Brin said , "Like point 
of view and (developing) 
dialogues. But it is very dilTicult 
to teach where you get ideas." 
He sU£l!.ested that writers could 

keep a notebook by their beds to 
Jot down their thoughts when 
inspired. 

"Writi:1g should be first and 
foremost a pleasure and a 

hobby," he advised . "Keep at it 
and keep it fun ," he tells writers, 
"and leam something useful that 
you can do as your day job, 
something that you enjoy. You 

have no idea whether you're 
going to be successful or not and 
even if you are , it's good to have 
something else because it 
Ireshens up your writing." He 
believes very strongly in Jacob 
Bernosky's philosophy behind 
the Ascent of Man , that a "skilled 
professional's joy is in his/ her 
craft." . 

David Brin feels a social 
responSibility to people. "I'm a 
little sensitve about this whole 
writing business," he confided. 
"Everyone says, 'Oh, how 
wonderful,' and all that, and I get 
10 earn a very good living doing 
what feels good," he said. "But I 
feel a little sheepish about it 
because that's no~ putting food 
on people's tables." 

Brin explores many fields , 
especially politlcs and science, in 
his writing. In his book titled 
The Postman , Brin examines life 
after a nuclear war. ::it's a novel 
about hope and perseverance. It 's 
about a fellow who is trapped

couldn't believe their eyes,

Still, I'm not completely down 
on HaDey's Comet. I'm thinking 
of joining an organization caned 
the Committee to Combat Comet

Com Coma. According to the Los 
Angeles Times, the group plans to 
arm themselves with flashlights 
and go outside on April 12 -
about the time the comet will

Earth. Then they1 point to

has been optioned by Warner 
Bros. for a future movie. 

Heart of the Comet is a book 
set on Halley's Comet from the 
years 2062-2142. A scientific 
expedition goes to the comet to 
harvest its ice and, of course. 
"gets into a lot of trouble." Brin 
remarked . The book, which will 
be released next month, is 
wrillen in collaboration with 
Gregory Benford , UC Irvine 

. physicist, who authored the 
novel Timescape , which is set on 
the UCSD campus. 

For avid fans of Brin 's Hugo

chimps' case, the "hosts" are

Brin will not be in San Diego 
much longer. "A year from now 
I'll probably be in London," Brin 
said wistfully. He will be working 
in London on an academic text 
dealing with the search for 
extraterrestrial intelligence. 

A lover of California, Brin 
volunteers on occasion to talk in 
ciry schools about writing or the 
space program He feels this is 
his way to "pay the state of 
California back" for what it has 
given him. 

He talks earnestly about kids 
today. "Kids have been cheated: 
not by their parents, but by their 
peers, in this sneering cynicism 
that you hear," he said with 
concern. "(They hear) that 

money is the Ol:rly important 
thing and anything that sounds 
like enthusiasm has got to be 
snee red at." He encourages 
students to follow their dreams 
because of the tremendous 
opportunities available to them 
today. . 

Among his diverse talents Brln 
likes to work out, to go camping 
and backpacking and he has 
recently started flying lessons 
This summer he will be hosting a 
science fiction convention in 
downtown San Diego, where 
writers and artists gather 
an nuaUy to share their skills with 
the public. 

Brin said in a prevIOus 
interview,"Every society needs its 
myths .. , Now many of the . 
cutting-edge myths are bemg laid 
before us by science fiction . The 
movies and books Fall Safe and 
Dr. Strangelove may have helped

combination of caution and ~ 
daring."

"Responsibility of instruction" 
is defined in UCSD's Policy and 
Procedure Manual, section PPM 
100·7 , under Maintenance of the 
Integrity of Academic Programs 
as: "Conducting the course in

"At the outset of the term he 
should inform his class about the 
course in reasonably full detail , 
so that the' students will know 
what is intended about course 
content." 

Professors submit to their 
departments a "course approval 
form" in which they describe the 
course (this description is very 
similar to the ones students find 
in the university course catalog.) 
The Academic Senate feels its

Men defeat St. Mary's, 
Berkeley, volleyball 2-1 in '86 
By TOM fERGUSON, Staff Writer 

T HE UCSD MEN'S volleyball team is already proving what they 
wanted to - that they can 
compete with bigger schools. 
After three matches the Tritons 
have posted a 2-1 record , a very 
successful start In the opimon of 
coach Digger Graybill. The first 
of their victories came Jan. 17 
against SI. Mary's College, a team 
which has just become a strong 
Division I contender. "We're 
really happy with that, it wa's a 
good win for us," said Graybtll. 
St. Mary's was fired up after 
WInning the first game but UC D 
came nght back and coorrolled 
the rest of the match, wmnmg 
the next three straight. 

The next day, the Tritons 
travelled to Berkeley for the All-
Cal tournament and took second 
in their pool which gained them 
a Spot in the semi-finals. In the 
tournament, "the team exhibited 
their strongest show by blocking 
and hitting for points , playing 
well as a team, and hustling 10 
keep the ball in play," said 
Graybill. 

They defeated a tough UC 

Berkeley squad in straight games 
in the semi-final matcll, but 
could not hold their own in an 
exciting match versus UCLA, 
losing 15-10, 15-6 in the final. 
UCLA is a top-flight volleyball 
team, and coach Graybill said 
that his team played "some of 
trw best volleyball" that he has 
seen since coming to UCSD. 
UCLA's coach was also quoted as 
saying after the match that "this 
is the best UCSD men's volleyball 
team that I've ever seen." The 
Triton's performance must have 
made quite an imp"ct to receive 
such an impressive comment 
from a man with umpteen CM 
championship teams to his 
credit. 

The exciting fact about the 
rest of the UCSD season, says 
Graybill, is that his team "still 
can play so much better and 
reach our potential, both 
individuaUy and as a team ... to 
gain a place among the top 
teams in volleyball." 

The next Triton chaUenge 
comes this weekend Oan. 31-
Feb. 1) at the UC Santa Barbara 
Michelob Tourney, in which they 

will face UCLA and UCB once 
again, in addition to Humboldt 
State and San Jose State in their 
pool. 

The tournament features pools 
with a total of 20 teams, and 
determines the best 16 teams, of 
which UCSD hopes to finish in 
the top seven. Last year they . 
finished 11th in this tournament. 
Graybill said that on paper, if 
they played as well as they did 
in the All-Cal Tourney, they 
should accomplish that goal. But 
Sports are not decided on paper, 
and volleyball is no exception so 
the Tritons will have 10 continue 
to prove themselves on the court. 

* * * V-BaU Notes: Next week, 
UCSD will meet a cross-town 
rival SDSU at San Diego State 
(Feb. 5) and will rerurn Feb. 7 
for rheir home opener at the 
Triton Pavilion against Loyola 
Marymounr. This match will 
feature the first of five spectator 
contests, with various prize 
giveaways ... Individual leaders:

Swimmers headed for 
shOWdown with Kenyon 
By ERICA GLENNON, Staff Wntcr 

The '85 Tritons (picturtd here last year) are "the best UCSD men's volltyball 
team I've ever setn," accordln~ to UCU's coach. 

FOR VETERAN members of the Triton swim team, just hearing Kenyon 
mentioned is likely to pump up 
their adrenalin. N~w swimmers 
on the Triton team are also likely 
to be inspired - but for the 
older T mons - the tradition 
and rivalry that goes along with 
Kenyon provides some solid 
incentive. 

Fnday morning, 21 members 
of the UCSD swim team and 
diving team will fly to OhIO to 
face Kenyon in a dual meet 
Kenyon expects to host 1,200 
spectators at Saturday's event. 
Kenyon is the 1985 Division !II 

ational Championship team, 
and the Tritons were third place 
finishers at the Division III 
Nationals last year. 

Twenty Division 11\ National 
Championship swimmers will be 
competing in the meet, six of 
which belong to UCSD. Besides 
being able to boast of their 
National Championship, Kenyon 
has not lost their conference tide 
in 34 years. Their conference 
record far exceeds the length of 

time UCSD has been in 
existence. 

UCSD has proven .to be quite 
formidable competition for 
Kenyon in recent years. The 
Tritons like their chance of 
defeating them on Sarurday. The 
women's team goes into the meet 
with an undefeated record (5-0). 
The men's team is also looking 
Impressive with a record of (2-1) 
their only loss being to Division I 
Irvine by a score of 57-54. 
Fourteen swimmers have already 
qualified for Nationals and the 
season is not yet over. 

DUring the past few weeks Bill 
Morgan , head swim coach, has 
received 10 calls from other 
coaches wishing him luck 
against Kenyon . "Everyone would 
love to see them get beat," he 
commented. The Tritons are only 
taking 11 men and 10 women 
on the trip, but Kenyon will 
swim an equal number against 
them. "We're not going back and 
planning on lOSing," said 
Morgan. "We're very even on the 
women. Their men may be a 
little stronger, but we can win ." 

Since a limited number of 
team members could qualify for 
the trip to Ohio, Morgan saw a 
lot of incentive in his swimmers 
over the past few weeks. "We've 
trained as hard as we ever have 
these last two weeks," Morgan 
commented. -

The Tritons have five captains, 
Dave Higdon, Bill Kazmierowicz, 
Butch Cramer, Allison Gilmore 
and Michelle Brafman. They have 
been strong leaders and all of 
them will be making the trip 10 
Kenyon. 

The Tritons who aren 't going 
to Kenyon will also be competing 
this Friday at home. They are 
hosting Division 1\ UC Riverside. 
Many Tritons still have not 
qualifted for Nationals, but may 
have the opportunity to do so 
now. Nationals ar~ in March. 

The women's team is ranked 
second nationally, the men's 
team is third . Kenyon is ranked 
second, and Claremont-Mudd 
holds the top spot. With the 
work the Tritons have put, 
Kenyon College may find itself in 
a struggle for second place. rz:a

Tennis 
destroys 
Redlands 
By DAVID TEQROW, Staff Writer 

I T WAS THE ARST match of the season for the UCSD women's tennis teani , so 
understandably, "some of (he 
girls were a little tense at (he 
start," said coach Liz laPlante. 
With only tWo returning starters, 
most of the~ players had yet to 
prove themselves in any 
intercollegiate matches. Thus, the 
scene was set for last Friday's 
match against Division II 
Redlands a learn UCSD has 
easily beaten in past years. This 
year's team showed they were no· 
different from past teams, as they 
ran away with the match, 8-1. 

Number one player, Jessica 
Vernon, the only starter with 
past single's experience, set the 
tone for UCSD by easily 
defeating Redlands' Nancy Wiens 
6-0, 6-3. "The team did really 
well for our first match. Some of 
the girls were nervous going out, 
but they all jumped out to early 
leads, calmed down and played 
well," Vernon said. 

For most of the women, after 
they jumped 'out to their early 
leads they continued to. attack, 
never looking back. Denise Sugi, 
Caroline Lee, Rhonda Meir, and 
Debbie DePaoli aU won their 

"The team did really 
well for our first 
match, " 

-Jessica Vernon 
singles matches in straight sets, 
losing an ,average of only one 
game per set. 

In the most eXCiting match of 
the afternoon , UCSD's number-
[WO seed, Maggie Merickel, lost 
to Kathy Nose 7-6, 4-6, 6-2. This 
was the only match to go the full 
three sets, so by the time the 
marathon was finally decided, 
most of the other girls had 
finished their doubles matches ' 
and darkness was descending 
upon the Muir courts. Nose was 
easily playing the best tennis of 
any of the women Redlands 
brought, but is not (heir number 
one player. "On the days she is 
playing well, she is really good, 
and very agressive; and Friday 
was one of those days," 
explained Vernon. 

Although she lost, the 
toughness and length of this 
singles match ·can only help 
Merickel, who last year only 
played doubles for UCSD. "I 
thought I played wen; except for 
my lobs, all my shots were 
working, but she hit more lines 
and made more put-aways. 
Coming back [0 win the second 
set helped my confidence, and 

He.lp

the :" 

advantage~ 

now I know whllt I have to do in 
practice so that I can win the 
third set from now on," said 
Merickel. 
. After their success in the 

Singles competition, the girls 
then teamed up to take all three 
of the doubles matches in 
straight sets. Vernon ·and 
Merickel beat Wiens and Nose 6-
1,7-5; Lee and Meir won 6-2, 7-
6; and Denise Sugi teamed with 
Deidra Wong to win 6-0, 6-l. 

UCSD's next two matches are 
both away. The first is tomorrow 
against Claremont-Mudd, and 
the second is next week against 
Pomona-Pitzer. Both of these 
schools are Division III schools, 
and the Tritons are favored as 
they have beaten both teams in 
the past. rz:a 

Academic freedom 
Continued from page 11 
not bad if it makes professors 
more factual," Arneson said, "If 
debate spiDs from the classroom 
into public forum - that is a 
good thing." 

Professors should not willfully 
lie, but can make errors that 
should be corrected by students, 
Arneson said. Academic freedom 
allows students to express and 
oppose, and if this expression 
occurs outside of the classroom, 
Arneson sees no threat to the 
professor.

Hooking 'T"hank you, Mr. President, sir." I noticed the Secret Service agems looking over the situation very 
carefully. When Mark said he 
was from San Luis ObiSPO, he 
told us that his son Steven had a 
horse ranch in that area. 

Continued from page 12 
the Speaker of the Hou e 

"Mr. Speaker, I'd like you to 
meet my son Mark from Cal Poly 
San LUIS ObiSpo and his friend 
Gus from UC San Diego." 

He gave Mark a puzzled look 
as he shook his hand . "Dahl-
mauth, is that where you're from? 
His Boston-[rish accent was as 
thick as a bowl of baked beans. 

"He's the one on the soap 
opera." 

My eyes li6hteJ up as I 
recognized the show. "Yeah, he's 
in the Young And The Restless. 
He's Andy Richards." 

"You know, he just gOt shot," 
the former PreSident informed 
me. 

. "No, sir," Mark replied, "I'm 
from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo." 

"Oh." It sounded as if he had 
never heard of the place. He 
then turned to me and shook my 
hand. [n my living existence, I 
had never seen a nose so large. 

"You're kidding!" [ was 
stunned. They wouldn't kill 01T 
Andy, He was such a nice guy. 
"Is he going to live?" [ asked 
worriedly. . 

"San Diego, huh? Well I'm sure 
glad to meet you." No doubt he 
thought I went to San Diego 
State, which is where everyone 
else seems to think , go when I 
tell them [ attend UC San Diego. 

"It's a pleasl!re to meet you, 
Mr. Speaker," I said nervously. [ 
felt my Adam's apple plop imo 
Squeaky." But it was ttie .usual 

"Don't worry, he lives." He 
gave me a small nod and picked 
up a nine iron from the caddy. 
Me and the former President . 
talking about soap operas. Only 
in America this could happen. 

As we neared Mark's house, 
which is about a sand wedge 
away from the 16th green, we 
could see Uncle Tip n~ar the 
pool with Mark's dad and a 
couple of other people. 
We both said "Hi" to him, but 

"In my living existence 1 had never seen a nose so large. " 
my gut. He lumbered his 
tumultuous body over to the golf 
can for another putT from his 
cigar. From the look of things 
Tip wasn't a health nut. 

I high-fived Mark on the way 
back to the golf can. "Can you 
believe it?" 1 said eXCitedly. "We 
just met the second most 
powerful man In this country!" 

"' know," said Mark, not 
sharing my enthusiasm. "It'U look 
good on a resume." 

"I forgot. You're a Republican." 
"So. He's stiU a great guy, but 

look at you, Mr. Cool. What 
happened to acting normal 
around famous people?" 

"Shut up. Don't bring up the 
past." 

We got to ride around the 
back of the golf can, following 
the celebrated cmourage 
everywhere . The Secret Service 
agents looked about as exCIted as 
the Patriots after the Super Bowl. 
"[t's my Job ," said the agent with 
a beer belly. 

One thing's for sure' Bob 
Hope has done a lot for golf. But 
by the end of the round it was 
easy to reahze that these guys 
were terrible golfers. O'Neill 
pegged an unsuspecting dog on 
the seventh hole. Hope spent 
more time putting than "Yips" 
McGoohan, and many people in 
the gaUery thought the former 
Presidem should change hiS 
name to Gerald "Fore" because of 
his affinity to hit into the crowd. 

Being Introduced to President 
Ford was another adventure In 
nerves. I had [his incredible urge 
to come up to him and say, "I Ii , 
Mr. President, my name's 

he was immersed in 
conversation, so I sat almost next 
to him near the pool. Once the 
conversation subsided, he turned 
ttj me and said in a low voice 
"Let me teU you this joke that' 
Doug Sanders (the golf pro) told 
Ford and me." 

"Sure." 1 gOt to remember this 
joke to teU my kids. 

"There's this pirate who's got a 
wooden stump for a leg, a metal 
hook for a hand and a patch on 
one eye. This guy comes up to 
him and asks him: 'How'd you 
lose your leg?' The pirate says: 
'Arr, well this shark jumped over 
the stem and bit me leg 01T." Tip 
was using very emphatic 
gestu res. 

" 'Well , how'd you lose your 
hand?' 

.. 'Arr, some bloke chopped it 
01T with his sword , so I stuck a 
hook in its place.' 

" 'Well then how'd you lose 
your eye?' 

" 'I looked up in the sky and 
a pigeon got me, so when I went 
[0 wipe my eye . I forgot I had 
the hook.' " 

His unruly mop 01 white 
hair flopped over his forehead 
and the purple veins in his 
honker seemed to bulge with 
each heany chuckle. This guy's 
tOO cool, [ thought. He said 
good by" and he and his Wife 
Millie were gone. [ returned to 
the pool area, where he had left 
an unlit cigar on the patio table. 
I picked it up , put It to a ziplock 
and discovered a perfect excuse 
to go back to Washington .

Now that the dust has settled (poor New England), and the Chicago 
Bears are the reigning champs of football fiefdom, it's time to once again 
check in with those insatiable sporn junkies down by the beach, at the 
venerable 01' University of California at San Diego. 

Another timeless quaner has staned up, and once more the crazies 
are at it again. This time it's the campus gymnasiums that are the weekly 
looney bins for that popular collegiate pasttime known as 1M basketball. 

And you thought the hype was unbearable this past week in New 
Orleans. Podner, you haven't seen a thing till you've witnessed a full 
season of intramural hoops. The weekly popping off is incredible, 
especially at the campus pub, where all the good basketball players on 
campus seem to hang out. 

The first three weeks of the '86 season have gone by pretty 
predictably. But as we approach mid-February, stan watching the lids 
of the Main and Rec gyms. 

They'll be rattling regularly like a pair of coftee percolators. 
Here's a quick capsule look at the early season races for number one:

2 Refrigerettes (2-0) 
3 Hookers (1-1) 
4 Omega High 0-0) 
5 The RARAs 0-1) 

ANALYSIS: The Triton Pub (averaging 
over 100 per game) has it all and then 
some. Height, shooting. and a 
fastbreak that doesn't shut down. 
These guys can dominate as well as any 
team since the Chicago Bears. 

ANALYSIS: Nos. 1-2-3 all have strong 
hiscories of finishing in the cop eight in 
this division . Look for all of them to go 
through their league seaso ns 
unscathed. 
Reagan, Dryden, and Co. should give 
Life After the edge, but it's still way too 
early to pick a favorite in the this rat 
race. 

ANALYSIS: This one could come down 
to the classic offense vs. defense 
confrontation with two teams from the 
same league. No. 2 Small Towers has 
shown plenty of big '0' early this 
season (they average around 70), but 

. the sleeper of all Single-A basketball 
just might be the defehse-oriented 
sharks from the Double-O Yacht Club. 
They lost a 33-30 struggle co last 
season's A Champs, SWAMP. . 

ANALYSIS: Easily the most exciting 
and competitive division in 1M Hoops. 
There are loads of quick, pressure-
oriented teams that like to light up the 
scoreboard . Two-time defend ing 
champs Smokeless Buds have a 25-
game win streak rolling into 1986, but 
this year they'll be tested to the max. In 
fact, they already have , in their 63-60 
donnybrook with Pasted Prime, an 
unranked team. 

ANALYSIS: There's two groups of 
hoopsters in this divlsion ... the haves 
and the have-nots. These teams on 
your left can all play and have plenty of 
female firepower. The rest? .. well, it 
might be a long season for most of 
them. 
ANALYSIS: Here's another one-sided 
race that has the II-Ounce Club 
looking for more competition. 
M:.lybe they can challenge the Men's 
AM Champs come March for the all-
campus championship.

Bones 
to pick 

Bone.s Danna Penres, Aaron Pitkin, Gary W~ire and Hope NidwllJ and (setJrea) Mmc Mueller. PhorO by PaW Red~. 

Kicking off Pop Events' weekly noon 
concert series yesterday, Fetchin Bones put 
on an appropriately fetching show on the 
steps of the Main Gym, a high-energy if (of 
necessity) low·volume triumph. The band 
from Charlotte, North Carolina 
demonstrated why its reputation has reached 
so far with only the benefit of one album on a 
"cowtown" label (Atlanta's DB Records). 

That record, the cryptically titled "Cabin 
Flounder" (from one of drummer Marc 
'Mueller's many suggested alternate names for 
the group), provided much of the hour's best 
songs, from the opening, sex.driven "So 
Brilliant" through to the closer,.a knock.aut 
overhauling of Van Morrison's "Gloria" -
by way of the Patti Smith Group - that the 
band calls "Btiefcase." 

The Bones' focal point was enthusiastic 
.lead singer Hope Nicholls, whose quick· 
thinking vocals did indeed often recall Smith, 
albeit with a . pronounced Southern accent. 
Her best effort, though, . was distinctly 
original: a reverent, moving version of "God's 
Hanky," a celebration of the glories of . 
everyday life - "Trees/lightning/States like 
this (California)" - that she once aptly 
described as "a love song - a Talking Heads 
ki~d of love song." (Nicholls further 
acknowledged the connection yesterday: "In 
case you missed it, the name of the band is 
Fetchin Bones, not the Talking Heads.") 

Helping out Nicholls, who also blew a 
mean, crude, Dylanesque harmonica, was 
Gary White, whose gruff, Keith Richards· 
edged vocals had just enough indisctinction to 
them to move the group into REM country. 
And, of course, Athens, Georgia is very close 
to Charlotte, NC, · as the Bones pointed out 
with their catchy, . semi·B52s tribute, 
"Kitchen of life." 

The Bones' sound, founded solidly on the 
, playing of Mueller (who threatens to give 

drum solos a good name again) and bassist 
Danna Pentes, featured a savvy mix of basic 
rock and folk touches, especially in the guitar 
playing of White and Aaron Pitkin. 

A band of musicians with their (extremely 
bright) future ahead of them, the Bones were 
an ideal choice to initiate the noon concerts, 
which will now switch to Thursdays.

Shades of purple 
The Color Purple, which was written by Alice Walker and adapted into a film 

by Steven Spielberg; is going to be nominated for Academy Awards in the areas 
of acting, directing and musical score. This picture is being well-received at the 
box office, too, because it displays a great variety of emotions that audiences of 
all ages can relate to. The film's message, in simple terms, is that "God gets 
pissed off if you walk through a field of purple lilies and don't stop to appreciate 
its love." 

It is mainly the story of an ugly duckling, Celie, played by talented stage 
veteran Whoopi Goldberg, and the extraordinary hardships she faces during 
her life. But what a story! This character might well become one of the 
quintessential .subjects in American cinematic history - few roles have ever 
carried such quiet icy and witticism. 

You'll see what I mean when you see the 
movie. High-quality acting, Spielberg's 
autographed images - such as cloud and 
kid shots - blended with the beautiful

The Akeda, a new opera 

composed by music graduate 
student Peter Ward, was 
produced this week in 
Mandeville Auditorium . 
Judging by the audience 
response, the opera appears to ' 
be both ' a musical and 
dramatic success. Composer 
Ward remarked during a 
reception after Tuesday 
night's performance, "Well, I 
think that it finally worked; it 
has its problems, as does 
everything that is put up 
quickly, but I think that it 
went well. Fortunately, I have 
some really good people 
working with me - Steve 
Person staged it, and of course 
I had two really good 
designers. " 

He was referring to'Costume 
designer Andrea Singer, and 
scenic and lighting designer 
Ron Ranson. (Note: Deborah 
Dryden, incorrectly identified 
in the Guardian Dan. 27), as 
costume designer, had begun 
in that capacity, then 
"advised" Singer when the , 
latter took over costum~ 
design.) 

Professor Carol Planta~ 
mura, 'chair of the music 
department, when questioned 
whether she, had she been Mr. 
Ward's instructor, would say 
he had passed his assignment, 
remarked, "I'm on his 
committee, so of course we're 
going to take him apart, but I 
think so, yes, he passed." 

The opera combines , 
ancient myth and modem 
composition, to create a work 
rich in tonal texture and deep 
with psychological impact. 

. Two myths, of fathers called 
upon to sacrifice a child, were 
combined in one continuous 
musical narrative. The story 
of Abraham and Isaac was 
taken from the book of 
Genesis, and the tale of 
Agamemnon and his daughter 
was based on Euripides' play 
Iphigenia in Aulis, according 
to composer Ward. Setting 
these myths, together, in a 
modem musical composition, 
the composer gave a kind of 
timelessness to their troubling 
message of what it means to be 
called upon to sacrifice one's 
own child. 

An op-era review 

Akeda bound up 
so long before I even got my 
(individual) music, by the 
time I got my music ... [ kind of 
had a feeling for it, already. I 
did a couple of the arias last 
quarter, for a class, so I kind 
of had a chance to play with it. 
So when [ got my staging, [ 
ended up having enough time 
to make it happen. By the time 
[ got it, I was ready to deal 
with it. I didn't have to think 
about it so hard." Ms. Spiro's 
dramatic training was evident 
in the grace with which she 
moved about the stase while 
playing her dual-childs' role. 

The work was staged in the 
pit area of Mandeville 
Auditorium, with the 
audience seated on the stage. 
In the center of the acting area 
was a raised platform, where 
most of the singing of 
Abraham/ Agamemnon and 
lsaac/lphigenia took place. 
The chorus, sung by Mark 
Childs, David Dramm, Jose 
A . Fernandez, Suzanne 
Gonzalez, Helen Madureira, 
Eileen Morris, Graham 
Parnel, Regan Ronayne and 
Lisa Kim Welti, circulated 
around this sacrificial area, 
urging on Agamemnon/ 
Abraham, with their voices of 
Elohim (the god of 
Abraham), the Greek army, 
and Artemis (the goddess to 
whom Iphigenia was 
sacrificed ). 

The orchestra, under the 
conducting of music 
professor John Silber, 
performed the difficult and 
rich score with clarity and 
feeling. Details of Peter 
Ward's composition tech~ 
nique and development were 
contained in an article 
published in Monday's 
Guardian Oan. 27). It must be 
said here that the intriacy of 
his work, with all its varying 
meters and fluid melodic 
lines, came across well in the 
performance. The combina~ 
rion of strings, brass, wind 
instruments and percussion 
worked well with the singers, 
neither overpowering them, 
nor paling in comparison with 

§ their strong voices.

Bob-bobbing around 
The San Francisco--based quartet The Bobs, who took their name from the dog show 

acronym the "best of breed," most certainly are, especially when performing their special 
brand of !lnu-wave a capella." 

The Bobs use no instruments, although they often sound lUI if they do. A disclaimer on 
their debut LP, The Bobs, warns, "All the sounds on this record were produced by the 
mouth or other parts of the body." 

The "pop-mod-dever"lyrics and music of The Bobs covers everything. Humor seems 
to be the common denominator along with an avid interest in the contemporary music 
scene, with some of the titles of their tunes being "I Hate the Beach Boys," "Psycho 
Killer" and "Be My Yoko." . 

Gunner Madsen, Janie Scott, Matthew Stull and Richard Greene are The Bob •. Since 
their inception in 1983 the talented quartet have been Bay Area Music Award nominees in 
1983 and '84 for The Bobs, and 1984 Grammy Award nominees for their arrangement of 
"Helter Skelter." 

The Bobs bring their "provocative mix of minimalist chic, off-the-wall wit and mind-
boggling vocal pyrotechnies" to the UCSD Mandeville Auditorium this Saturday, Feb. 1.

Old Holmes ••• 
by robert leone 

Although there have been a 
good many films (and 
television shows) feauturing 
in some way the· characters 
created by Sir Arthur Conan 
Doyle, perhaps the best 
known are the Basil 
Rathbone-Nigel Bruce films, 
with Rathbone starring as 
Holmes and Bruce portraying 
Watson . Although many 
purists decry these films, the 
image of Holmes and Watson 
that they portray is the most 
common. 

These films are well known 
for the way they play fast and 
loose with Doyle's plots, 
often tossing together almost 
unidentifiable elements from 
different stories. For example, 
the 1946 film Sherlock Holmes 
- Dressed to Kill has a bizarre 
plot concerning musical boxes 
made in a prison, A Scandal in 
Bohemia (the first Sherlock 
H olmes story) being 
published in the age of 
automobiles instead of in the 
1880s, someone using one of 
Holmes ' tr icks on Dr . 
Watson, and so on. It is still a 
lovely film if one doesn 't 
mind the anachronisms. One 
particularly galling feature is 
Bruce's portrayal of Watson 
as an aged, near-senile and 
very dense person who is 
virtually useless in a crisis. 
Th is i mage is further 
reinforced by the toupe worn 
by Watson's old school 
chum, "Stinky." Fortunately, 
for the viewers, it isn't long 
before "Stinky" gets knocked 
off . ... 

A more entertaining tale, 
for some, would be Sherlock 
Holmes and the Secret Weapon. 
In this 1942 film, supposedly 
based on Doyle's The Dancing 
Men but actually based on the 
standard elements of the spy 
thrillers of the time, Lionel 
Atwill stars as Dr. Franz 
T abel, a Swiss scientist who 
has created a new bombsight 
that will "revolutionize aerial 
bombardment." Holmes, in a 
strange set of maneuvers that 
include impersonating a Nazi 

agent, then stealing the real 
Nazi's car, smuggles Tobelout 
of Switzerland into England. 
Tobel then gives England the 
use of his bombsight, buttries 
to control the use and 
manufacture of the device 
personally. In the meantime, 
the Germans have hired 
Professor Moriarty, Holmes' 
nemeSis, to retrive T obel and 
the bombsight. Tobel is 
kidnapped, and the only clues 
to the location of the 
bombsight are an unused bit 
of gift-wrapping paper and a 
cipher in the form of little 
dancing men. All in all, the 
film is a splendid bit of light 
propaganda against Germany 
and for Britain. The manner in 
which the film capitalizes on 
the United States' then top-
secret yet well publicized 
Norden bombsight is clever. 

Another in the series is the 
1946 film Terrar by Night, 
where, as one would expect, 
there is a slew of bodies, the 
corpses being the by-products 
of a jewel robbery scheme. 
The first stiff is Holmes' 
client. The plot, which takes 
full advantage of the train 
setting, is convoluted, as one 
might expect. 

Personally, my favorite old 
Holmes film is Sher lock 
Holmes and the Loch Ness 
Monster, which has an 
incredible amount of charm. 
Holmes has to fight off the 
amorous ballerinas, while 
Watson has to fight off 
amorous ballaides. Then 
there's the monster, which 
nearly drowns Holmes, 
Watson and the client. 
Holmes mainlines cocaine to 
fight depression, and 
discovers that his reputation 
is better than he i'i.In fact, this 
old film (not one of the 
Rathbone-Bruce group, I 
believe) gives Holmes and 
Watson stronger characters 
than any other older film I 
know of. If it comes up on the 
late night movie circuit, you'd 
do worse than to watch it.

••• and new condos 
by robert leone 

If Although Sir Arthur 
Conan D-:>yle did not write 
about the very youthful years 
of Sherlock Holmes and 
established the initial meeting 
between Holmes and Dr. 
Watson as adults, the film 
Young Sherlock Holmes is an 
affectionate speculation about 
what might have happened 
had the sleuth and his partner 
met during their college 
years .. . . " 

Thus begins the movie. It's 
a cute film, one that will 
probably cause groans of 
agony among purist Sherlock-
ians. If you're not one, you 
might groan a little anyway. 
Watson meets Holmes when 
he first goes to "publiC:' (in 

the States, a private) school, 
and gets embroiled first in 
Holmes' struggles against the 
priggish school bullies, and 
then in Holmes' investigations 
of the deaths of a number of 
old men, including the aged 
professor whose niece is in 
love with Holmes. Hallucino.-
gens, bizarre cults, and gobs of 
London fog compose the 
heart of the story. 

Nightmare sequences show 
the hallmarks of the Speilbei-g 
studio animation units, and 
include both the horrible and 
the ridiculous. 

Warts on the face of this 
film include Holmes' ability. 
He's presented as a true 
superhuman, drawing forth 

incredible conclusions on 
little evidence. Nicholas Rowe 
deserves great credit 

Alan Cox ably presents 
Watson as an overeater who 
desperately wants good grades 
for his medical school 
application and comes near to 
stealing the show. This is one 
role that might be close to the 
hearts of UCSD students. 

If you don't mind a film 
which has a fair number of 
holes in it's plot, you might 
like this sometimes funny, 
sometimes sad film. But if you 
see it, wait until the very end, 
even past the credits. 
Speilberg has sequel fever, 
and has added a little tag to 
Young Sherlock Holmes.

sees the movement gaining in

Greg, owns a weekend

passing trend for most people.

sees a similarity between the 
two, but feels that the second

paisley strikes back 

and there have been "more 
people coming into Lou's 
with velvet jackets and long 
pageboy haircuts." Yet he 
views the "revival" as just 
another spiral in the cycle of 
music, which is "running its 
course." He claims he'd be a 
bit more enthusiastic "if they 
were doing something new to 
the music." 

Here on campus, Frank 
Yahr, a D.J. for KSDT, has a 
regular special '60s show 
every Thursday from 9-12 
pm, during which he plays 
both new groups (The 
Pandoras, the Tell Tale Hearts 
and others) and the original 
groups (The Seeds and the 
Yardbirds) that, Yahr 
remarks, were the same ones 
"that got played at college 
stations in the '60s. And 
apparently, he receives a lot of 
good feedback in the form of 
calls and requests. 

necessarily follow that the 
return of the teardrop design 
(I rather think it resembles a 
microscopic bacteria) has 
anything to do with this new 
wave of music, yet the strong 
- almost symbiotic -
relationship between music . 
and fashion is no secret to 
anyone. 

We'll get back to you as soon 
as we get the surfboard out of the 
bathtub. - Dionysius 
Records' answering machine. 

Up in L.A., the Dionysius 
Record label specializes in 
groups that produce music of 
this genre. Owner Lee Joseph 
started the company in 
Tucson in 1982 .. On the label 
are groups liKe The Untold 
Fable ("a garage band"), The 
Forgiven, The Cynics, From 
Pittsburg ("hard to explain") 
and Yard Trauma ("grass 
roots rock and roll"). Joseph 
is a member of Yard Trauma 
and another band, The 
Unclaimed. Asked if he sees 
evidence of a '60s reVival, he 
answers, "I hate the term 
revival; for me I've been into it 

chord patterns - raw energy 
level and sexual appeal." He 
mentions that ·this music had 
its roots in the very early rock 
and roll that was mostly black, 
but then was changed by white 
commercial performers in the 
'50s. His one, big lament is 
that at this point, music began 
to lose its sexual appeal. 
"People like Pat Boone took 
the sex out of it." So how does 
he explain a new interest in 
this style of music? He 
explains it in terms of a 
general frustration with 
everything else, because 
"nothing great is happening. 
Punk brought rock and 
fashion out of the doldrums 
- techno-pop is superficial 
and based around fashion." 
He then mention the bandJoy 
Di.v.on. "They made their 
ri.ark and then their lead 
singer hung himself - it's no 
fun; depressing music. Music 
was more positive in the 
'60s." 

In L.A. Joseph estimates 
that the music has a following 
of around 200 people, and he

seven or eight years; I shelved 
it when it became popular." 

Garry Shrum is the 
owner/manager of Blue 
Meannie Records in EI Cajon, 
which specializes in '60s/ 
psychedelic music selections. 
He also has noticed a revival 
of interest in this type of 
music over the last two years 
in the United States, and 
claims he was already fulfilling 
mail order requests even 
earlier from Europe, where 
the music "had already caught 
on full strength." 

At his store, Shrum has 
noticed more young people 
(between the ages of 14 and 
18) coming in and asking for . 
records by both old and new 
'60s artists. Interested in 
promoting the British 
Invasion music of the '60s, he 
opened Blue Meannie 10 
years ago. He admits, though, 
that he didn't know if there 
would be much of a market in 
San Diego, but that's where he 
happens to live. During this 
time, he has also followed the 
second British Invasion, 

grounds for this style at 
music, producing bands like 
Plastic Land (originally from 
Milwaukee), Plan Nine 
("heavy - really good") and 
the Chesterfield Kings ("more 
British invasion than 
psychedelic"). And in San 
Diego, he recommends the 
Tell Tale Hearts: "Go see 
them; they're fantastic!" 

Meanwhile, at the other end 
of town, Lou's Records has 
been a witness to a revival of 
sorts. Located in Encinitas, 
Lou's is the musical mecca of 
North County, offering a wide 
selection of new and used 
records, imports, video 
rentals, posters and T-shirts. 
An extremely popular place 
- if there was a new '60s 
movement, they'd know 
about it. 

"Ah, hmm . .. Who's our 
resident '60s person? Hold on 
a sec please." 

According to Steven 
Harkinson who works at the 
store, the sale of '60s albums 
and order·s have bee n 
increasing over the last year, 

Yahr also works at UEO, 
which has organized a 
"psychedelic revival night" at 
the Pub on Feb. 22, in which 
the featured groups will be the 
Pandoras, the Things, the Tell 
Tale Hearts and The Untold 
Fable. 

As for the paisley, Yahr 
claims that what we're seeing 
now isn't the same as the 
original motif: "Not as 
complex, not mixed with 
different colors, but an 
outline printed on plain; 
single-colored material - a 
paisley stamp." Whereas the 
original desing was "more 
complex, entangled." So there 
is obviously something more 
to this than just a passing 
trend ....
