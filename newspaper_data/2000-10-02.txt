San Diego Walks to Benefit 
AIDS Organizations 
UCSD students among 20,000 participating in annual 
AIDS Walk to support research for th e disease 
By lIOII CIIIANI' , 
Contributing News Writer 

An estimated 20,000 people took part in 
the five-kilometer AIDS Walk San Diego on 
Sunday, an event designed to promote aware-
ness of AIDS and HfV and to raise money to 
fund research for their treatment and cure. 

The walk took place in Balboa Park and 
Hillcrest, and featured a display of AIDS 
Memorial Quilt panels and a Path of 
Remembrance for those who have fallen vic-
tim to the disease. 

AIDS Walk San Diego claims to have 
raised over $4.5 million since its inception in 
1989. The money is traditionally distributed 
to local organizations serving people with 
HIV. according to promotional' materials pro-

vided by the nonprofit organization. 
The recipients of this fundraiser include 

organizations such as Being Alive Camp 
Laurel, Family Health Care Centers, The San 
Diego Needle Exchange and Mama's 
Kitchen. 

Last year's AIDS Walk San Diego raised 
$540,000. Participating were 179 registered 
teams of at least 15 people, usually from a 
company or organization, and individuals, 
who accounted for 58 percent of the. money 
raised. 

Some 10,000 people have reported being 
HlV positive in San Diego County according 
to a report issued by the County of San 
Diego's Health and Human Services Agency.

Victims of 
Credit Debt 
Gov. Davis vetoes· bill 
regulating credit vending 
practices on campuses 
By ROB GRANT 
Contributing News Writer 

While UCSD students were gearing up 
for the fall quarter, in Sacramento, Gov. 
Gray Davis vetoed an effort by state legisla-
tors to regulate the marketing practices of 
credit card companies on college campuses 
statewide. . 

Senate Sill 796. vetoed by Davis on Sept. 
18, would have required that the governing 
bodies for University of California. 
California State University and community 
colleges to establish policies requiring that 
credit card vendors offering "free gifts" pro-
vide prospective student cardholders with 
information on the potential pitfalls of cred-
it cards before they sign on the dotted line. 

· Personal responsibility cannot be man-
dated by government: Davis stated to the 
legislature in his veto message. "The answer 
lies first and foremost with parental guid-
ance." 

'One credit card vendor at last week 's 
vendor fair on Library Walk disagreed. 

"That doesn 't happen , obviously," said 
the vendor, identified as Steve. "That's prob-
ably just lobbyist money talking." 

Third-year Revelle student Raina Taitano 
agreed. 

"College students are targeted because 
[they) are generally younger and inexperi-
enced when it comes to credit: she said. 

"Steve: who described himself as a mar-
keting representative, said if there was a 
state law requiring him to give the potential 
cardholders a brochure, he would do so 
every time. 

"I try to do it as much as I can, but when 
we get swamped I forget to do it: he said. 
"Some of the companies give us brochures 
to give out to go along with the applications, 
but most people don't take it." 

Steve said he was unable to produce a 
copy of such a brochure because of a mid-
week staffing switch at his booth.

New Campus Structure Does UttIe to Alleviate Parking Woes

UThere is no way that there is 
almost an equal number of gradu-
ate students and faculty as there 
are undergraduates on campus: 
said Marshall sophomore Eric 
Robin . "But there is nearly the 
same amount of spots allocated to 
both groups." 

In addition, most students have 
not been able to park in the new 
structure created this year. The uS· 
spaces in the structure are usually 
filled to capacity before 8 a.m. due 
to the number of commuters who 
must arrive early for morning 
classes. 

300-plus "S" spaces in the struc-
ture, these spaces fill with ERC 
and Warren resident vehicles or 
commuters who arrive early," Snee 
said. "Less than 5 percent of our 
student spaces are allocated in the 
structure, so I am hopeful that stu-
dents understand that this facility . 
will not solely addres5 the majority 
of student parking needs." 

The $16.2 million structure has 
also contributed to an increase in

Continued from page 1 

and a co-worker, students with clip-
boards sat filling out as many as 10 
applications for various credit cards. 
Available at the booth were two appli-
cations for the Discover Classic Card, 
two applications for the First Bankcard 
Center College Visa, one for the 
Citibank Platinum Select and Click 
Chi Platinum Select student cards, the 
AT&T Universal Card Student 
Platinum Card, GTE Visa, the 
American Express Credit Card for stu-
dents and The Associates Visa Card. 
According to Steve, while no one is 
forced to fill out the applications, more 
free gifts are given to students if they 
are filled out. 

The gifts, ranging from silk-
screened T-shirts to incense holders, 
incense and non-name-brand sun-
glasses were prominently displayed for 
a prospective cardholder's perusal. 

But this approach is disturbing to 
Ken Knott, Southern California 
regional distribution manager for 
Alumni Association credit cards, who 
said that students often do not realize 
that the cards can seriously affect their 
credit rating, and thus, their ability to 
make purchases on credit in the 
future, such as a car or house. 

Knott said that every Wne some-
one applies for a new card, his credit 
rating can get dinged, especially with 
high interest rate cards and recurring 
daily interest charges. 

"Those guys get paid $5 per appli-
cation," Knott alleged. Steve refused to 
divulge the amount he and his co-
worker received per application.

Parking: 
Driving congestion has 
increased with construction 
ContInued from ..... 1 

Some students have begun to com-
plain about the increased prices of the 
permits. They feel the reason for build-
ing the structure was to make room for 
the school to create new colleges, and 
therefore, make more money. 

"What bothers me is that the 
Sixth College being put in is the rea-
son this school has to put in a new 
parking structure and increase our 
parking prices," said Phil Miller, a 
Muir sophomore. "However, UCSD 
is the only one that stands to make a 
profit with the addition of all the new 
students on campus. They should be 
paying for the new structure, not us." 

Additionally, there has been an 
increase in driving congestion around 

. campus as a result of the construction 
currently being performed around the 
Gilman site. 

"There have been additional traffic 
concerns at the corner of La Jolla 
Village Drive and Villa La Jolla Drive 
due to roadway construction associat-
ed with the project; Snee said. "But 
this work should be completed in early 
October." 

The school has taken measures to 
remedy this traffic problem by widen-
ing the left-turn lane that leaves cam-
pus and turns into Villa LaJolla Drive. 

"I am glad that something is being 
done to improve this road; said 
Marshall sophomore Manson Huie. 
"When I leave campus each day, I want 
nothing more than to just get home. I 
have no patience waiting in traffic that 
I shouldn't have to wait in." 

In addition, the UCSD Parking 
Transportation Committee is in the 
process of computing the number of 

~A" spots left unused each day so that 
It can explore the possibility of 
changing them' into "SO or "S" spots 
in the future. 

" I know that this change wouldn't 
make things that much better," 
Miller. "But there are usually so 
many spots that are left unused, and 
it would be nice if someone could 
take advantage of them."

BRIEFLY 

UC to Study Labor and Employment 
The University of California is startin& a new 

multicampus research initiative intended to 
study and find solutions for problems of employ· 
ment in California and the nation. 

The project is tentatively titled the UC 
Institute for Labor and Employment and will build 
upon existing work by the Institutes of Industrial 
Relations at UC Berkeley and UCLA. 

The initiative is funded by a $6 million appro-
priation in the current state budget and will pro-
duce an annual study of the California work 
force. 

The research will provide the basis for a wide-
ly accessible report that will offer policy recom-
mendations. 

The institute will also maintain a Web-based 
library where the public can easily view results 
and findings. 

Local philanthropists donate 
$13 million to Shlle, Center 

UCSD announced Thursday that it has 
secured over $13 million in private support to 
add space and research facilities to the Donald 
P. and Darlene V. Shiley Eye Center complex . 

The center is located on campus near 
Thornton Hospital and will house retinal and 
glaucoma research facilities. 

Contributing to the center's funding are four 
leadership gifts including those given by Joan 
and Irwin Jacobs to support the retinal 
research center; the Hamilton White 
Foundation, established by Frances White, 
Harvey White and their children, to support the 
glaucoma research center; and Donald and 
Darlene Shiley to support the expansion of clin· 
ical and educational programs. 

The Shiley Eye Center opened in 1991 and is 
34,000 square feet. The donations will allow the 
addition of 26,000 square feet to house new 
research facilities. 

UCSD science lab Is damaged 
In Saturda, fire 

A fire broke out in Charles Zuker's lab in the 
Cellular and Molecular Medicine Building 
Saturday. 

The fire occurred at 6:15 a.m. in the lab 
where fruit·fly research was being conducted. 

A. hazardous materials team was called to 
investigate the incident after it was believed 
that water from the fire sprinkler had become 
contaminated. Fire officials found no hazardous 
materials contamination and the cause of the 
fire is still unknown. 

Consortium receives grant for 
protein study 

The National Institutes of Health announced 
Wednesday they would provide a grant for a San 
Diego based research consortium including 
UCSD, The Scripps Research Institute and the 
San Diego Supercomputer Center. 

The institutes announced they WOUld . 
donate $24 million over five years to the con· 
sortium titled The Joint Centef for Structural 
Genomics. 

The consortium will participate in an Interna-
tional initiative to better understand the chemi· 
cals that control biological processes in living 
organisms and will also advance the use of com-
puters and robots to do such research. 

Researchers at the Stanford University 
Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory are also 
involved in the consortium, and the San Diego 
based participants will select genes for study 
and prepare them for computer work in the 
Stanford lab where the structure will be deter· 
mined.

A $4.4 million NSF Genome Award titled Gene 
Discovery in Aid of Plant Nutrition, Human 
Health and Environmental Remediation was fund-
ed for research over a 4-year period. 

The grant will fund research using high 
throughput technologies developed by Julian 
Schroeder of UCSO and Jeff Harper, associate 

prof~ssor at the Scripps Research Institute, to 
survey the entire genome of the plant 
Arabidopsis as well as a major crop plant such 
as rice or corn for genes that enhance accumu-
lation of nutrients. 

The research could lead to technologies that 
require less use of fertilizers and reduce envl· 
ronmental pollution from runoff into ground 
waters and the ocean.

Senior Sf8ff Writer 

For a few years now, the San Diego

dreamed of building a new downtown 
ballpark. It is a dream of something that 
would be special for the team and fof'

will halt. This is clearly a strong-arm 
tactic by the ownership to get more 
money, amounting to nothing less than 
a threat. 

The building of the ballpark has 
been done illegally. Construction has 
been staned, with the foundation and 
steel suppons already in place, yet there

there are a number of positives to the 
project, such as revitalizing the part of 
downtown that the park would settle 
in, new revenues for the Padres that 
would allow them to compete better 
with other Major League teams, and 
adde.d revenues for the city because of a 
new attraction. 

These are Jill fine, but the two sides

and the city staned this project not 
understanding what they were getting 
themselves into.

$411 million with $220 million coming

Padres owntr John Moores and some 
members of the city council, which is 
highlighted by a federal probe into the

Lupus Hits 
Many, Few. 
Understand 
More attention 
should be given to 
this common disease 

PARISA BAHARIAN 
On June 2, 2000, I sat in the 

doctor's office at the Student 
Health Center awaiting the results 
of my blood tests. I was expecting 
nothing to show up, as usual; I had 
started the process of trying to 
diagnose my condition bef?re 
November 1999; and nothmg 
seemed to explain why I continued 
to have such excruciating pain in 
my hands and joints. 

I did" not expect lupus. I sat 
there stunned. I could not compre-
hend it. Then thoughts rapidly 
tlashed " through my mirid and I 
saw the newspaper anicte I had 
just skimmed over a few months 
ago: The sister of Howie, from the 
Backstreet Boys, died of lupus. 

1 was scared. People can die 
from lupus. I forced myself to lis-
ten to the doctor explain the dis-
ease and how I have a milder case. I 
tried to absorb how lupus is a seri-
ous and potentially fatal autoim-
mune disease, which ca useS' 
inflammation of various parts of 
the body's organs. 

Pushing back the panic. I forced 
myself to ask questions about this 
disease. 1 learned that f have the 
type of lupus called systemic lUpus, 
which can affect almost any organ 
or system in the body. 

As I sat there. everything sud-
denly clicked. All the little, seem-
ingly isolated symptoms I had been 
experiencing recently and over the 
years painted a larger picture -
lUpus. 1 realized those episodes ?f 
dizziness, nausea and difficulty In 
breathing I have had every day 
since around February could be 
symptoms of this dilapidating dis-
ease. The agonizing and constant 
pain that engulfs my hands when-
ever I write, type, hold the phone 
or even when I do absolutely noth-
ing at all, are symptoms of lupus 
arthritis. 

As I walked out of the Student 
Health Center, I was in tears. My 
entire life changed on that day. I 
'realized at that moment that I had 
taken for granted that I would live 
until I am bid and gray. 

Lupus shattered ' all those 
dreams, as I had to reconcile 
myself with the fact that 1 cannot 
control what will happen to me or 
when I will die. I became conscious 
that death stalks all of us, but it 
knocks sooner on the doors of 
some than others. 

I started to research with a 
vengeance everything I could 
about lupus and found there is no 
cure. I discovered that lupus is a 
disease that affects women nine 
times more often than men, and 
affects African-American women 
three times more often than 
women of European descent. 

The Lupus Foundation of 
America estimates that between 
1.4 million and 2.0 million 
Americans have been diagnosed 
with lupus, and that many more 
cases have gone undiagnosed. 

What shocked me most of all is 
that although more people in 
America have lupus than AIDS, 
cerebral ralsy, multiple ~Ierosis, 
sickle-cel anemia and CYStiC fib~­
sis combined, less federal money IS 
spent on lupus research per 
patient! 

I further discovered that a 1999

Under Fire: The Che Cafe Takes a Stand 
UCSD has a history of repress-

look at the history of the co-ops 
and unions on this campus. The 
latest episode is this summer's 
attempted shutdown of yet anoth-
er student-run co-operative:, the 
Che Cafe. 

For those of you who are unfa-
miliar with this campus landmark, 
the Che Cafe: has provided the 
university and the rest of. ~an 
Diego with a resource for aCtiVISts, 
vegetarians, vegans and indepen-
dent, underground music for over 
20 years. 

On May 31, the administration 
issued a directive to the Che Cafe: 
Collective, demanding that it aban-
don its policy of admitting patrons 
of all ages into its musical events. 

Administrators 'cited incidents 
of fighting and a1cohol- for wh~ch 
they were later unable to prOVide 
any tangible proof - as their rea-
sons for issuing the directive. 

The Collective carried on with 
all-ages shows, unwilling to sacri-
fice one of the few venues in San 
Diego County open to young peo-
ple. 

The university then took illegal 
and abrupt measures to lock the 
members of the Che Collective 
out of their building, the same way 

they tried to 
lock co-op 
members out of 
the General 
Store several 
years ago. 

In response 
to' 'these 
extreme mea-

other co-op 
members, stu-

frequenters of 
the Che and 
local activists 
broke into the 
building and 
occupied it in 
protest for 72 
hours until UC 
workers 
removed their 
locks and 
agreed to enter 
into negotia-

fo rmer residence a toxic sink 
hole. The bay cleanup is expected 
~o take over a year, and this will 
push back the development of a 
1,200-room hotel to be located 
next to the convention center 
and ballpark. The city expected 
nearly $6.5 million in room taxes 
from this hotel alone, and the 
delay in its completion will take 
even more money away from the 
project. 

The Padres call for the city to 
find ways aro\1nd these problems, 
while the city ca lls for the Padres 
to come up with different plans 
for financing the ballpark. 
However, the public-vs.-private 
issue needs to end. 

Problems arise during pro-
jects of a grand scale; Rome was 
not built in a day. Although this 
project has a grandeur nowhere 
near that of Rome, it does cost 
more. The twO sides need to set 
aside their issues and consider 
what is good for the city, and 
that is the completion of the 
ballpark . 

The ballpark is going to act as 
the focal point of a revitalization 
of the downtown area, creating 
better public transit, new parking 
structures, upscale apartments 
and the aforementioned hote l. 

The stadium' will give the 
Padres a state-of-the-art residence 
in which to compete. In the cut-
throat world of professional base-
ball, this is a necessity. New ball-

parks are popping up all over the 
country, from Seattle to 
Milwaukee to Baltimore, and pro-
vide teams with an increased rev-
enue stream, which allows them 
to sign the players they need to be 
competitive. 

A competitive team means 
good news for the city. Who can 
forget the pennant drive and 
playoff run of 1 998 when the 
Padres made it all the way to the 
World Series, only to be defeated 
by the Bronx Bombers? I heard

For an example of what a new 
stadium can do for a team and a 
city. look to San Francisco, where 
just this year. Pac Bell Park was 
opened and the windy confines 
of 3Com abandoned. From

done for the Giants. They have 
one of the best records in the 
league, the best in the National 
League, and are 29 games over 
.500 at home. 

What cannot be measured 
from just looking at the stupen-
dous achievements of the Giants 
is the intangibles that a new stadi-
um brings to an. area. People are 
excited to see baseball games and 
have a sense of pride of being able 
to go to their new stadium in such 
a beautiful place and watch their 
team do battle. 

A new ballpark creates a buzz 
of excitement that everyone can 
share. In San Francisco, it is a 
fight to get tickets to the game, 
and once at the game, the vibe is 
unbelievable. Forty thousand 
screaming, roaring fans, raging for 
their team - and the fans at that 
game only go out and get more 
people riled up about going to a 
game. 

It is these intangibles that the 
Padres and the city must keep in 
mind, for these are what are 
important. Arguments over pub-
lic and private money are inane, 
because what a new stadium 
brings is a conglomeration of pri-
vate support for a team, which in 
turn breeds public pride. Any 
arguments over public and private 
money can only be borne out of 
greed for wanting someone else to 
finance what everyone knows is a 
boon: • 

[f the Padres and the city know 
what is good for the city, they will 
sit down at the bargaining table 
and not get up until a plan is 
hammered out that has the stadi-
um back on track and ready to 
open in 2002.

During all of this. people forget 
that the Padres already have a 
home. [t is not as if the team has

pie to vote on the approval of the 
bond, constituting a gross conflict 
of interest if the allegations of 
insider trading are true. As a big 
surprise, Stallings voted in favor of 
the Padres and the building of the 
new stadium. 

There is another aspect of the 
ballpark issue that is disturbing: the 
relocation of a number of homeless 
people who currently spend their 
days and evenings in the area that is 
to house the new stadium. 

Perhaps this aging stadium is 
more of a football place. but it could 
still support a baseball team for a 
few more years, until the city and 
the Padres get their acts together. 

Furthermore, negative impacts 
that the ballpark could have on the 
city should be looked at. Currently, 
traffic in the area is no picnic. 
Think of the repercussions of hav-
ing 46.000 fans get in their cars to 
leave after the game ends.

- Where these homeless people 
would relocate is a concern. but 
the city could not think of any-
thing to do about it. The city's 
worry is that the homeless that will 
be dispersed would decrease the 
value of the surrounding areas. 

This is absolutely disgusting. 
This is a public and private joint 
venture costing millions of dollars. 
and yet the involved parties have 
no idea what to do with fellow 
human beings who are down on 
their luck: 

Here is an idea, councilmem-
bers: Take the $500 million or so, 
and instead of building a pretty 
playing field for a bunch of ov.er-
paid, whiny, self-congratulating 
babies, take the cash and help your 
fellow man. That much money 
would go far in terms of these peo-
ple.

not dealt as favorable a hand as 
some of us. The money wasted on •

Some games begin at 1:1 5 in 
the afternoon and last three hours. 
That means people will be exiting 
the game at around 4:45 p.m., 
right in the heart of rush hour. 
Other games start at 7:15 p.m., 
meaning people will be entering 
the area during rush hour. 

It could be a traffic disaster. The

Pope John Paul II Canonizes 120 
Catholics Killed in China 

ROME - Pope John Paul II 
Sunday canonized 120 Roman 
Catholics killed in China, defying 
the Chinese government, which 
had condemned the action as an 
insulting reminder of colonial 
imperialism. 

The canonizations, which also 
made a saint of Mother Katharine 
Drexel, a turn-of-the-century 
American philanthropist, under-
lined the complex geopolitics that 
vein the Vatican's spiritual mis-
sion. 

China had no saints before 
Sunqay. By canonizing as mar-
tyrs 87 Chinese believers and 33 
European missionaries killed 
between 1648 and 1930, John 
Paul sought to send a strong sig-
nal to China's beleaguered 
underground Catholics, who are 
loyal to the pope. But he risked 
the wrath of the Chinese govern-
ment, with which the Vatican 
badly wants to revive diplomatic 
relations. 

And by making a saint of the 
Philadelphia heiress who became 
a nun and spent her fortune to 
found schools for American 

Chinese leaders had 
fiercely denounced the 
plan to hold Sunday's 
ceremony on the 
anniversary of the 
founding of the People's 

. Republic in 1949. 
Indians and poor blacks, the pope 
not only honored Mother Drexel's 
social conscience. but also recog-
nized the influence of American 
Catholics. who raise more money 
for the Vatican than Catholics in 
any other country. 

Mother Drexel, who died in 
1955, is only the second saint 
born in the United States. The 
first was Elizabeth Ann Seton, 
who was canonized in 1975. 

The 80-year-old pope has 
created more saints .than all of 
his predecessors combined, 
using the process to raise the 
profile of the church in some 
countries and to create new role 
models for today's believers. 

Sunday, he also canonized 
Josephine Baktira, a former slave 
from Sudan, the first African 
saint not canonized as a martyr, 
and Maria Josefina, a Spanish 
nun who, like Katharine Drexel, 
founded a religious order. 

The creation of Chinese mar-
tyred saints, intended as an inspi-
ration for what the Vatican esti-
mates are 8 million Chinese 
Catholics loyal to the pope, 
inevitably angered the Chinese 
Communist government. 

Chinese leaders had fiercely 
denounced the plan to hold 
Sunday'S ceremony on the 
anniversary of the founding of 
the People's Republic in 1949. 
And in Beijing on Sunday, leaders 
of China's state-run church sided 
with the authorities. "Today is 
National Day, and more than 
ever Chinese Catholics should 
stand with the nation: Bishop Fu 
Tieshan told worshippers at 
South Cathedral Sunday morn-
ing.

Bush Invoking Ronald Reagan as 
Kindred Political Spirit' and Charmer 

AUSTIN, Texas - To make 
the case that a politician who sup-
ports more federal programs can-
not also support more power for 
the middle class, Gov. George W. 
Bush said two weeks ago that vot-
ers did not simply have to take his 
word for it. 

They could listen to Ronald 
Reagan, who once said, "You can't 
be for big government, big 
bureaucracy, and still be for the 
linle guy." 

On Friday, giving a speech on 
energy, Bush quoted Reagan at 
even greater length, asserting that 
the same questions Reagan raised 
about President Carter in the 
1980 presidential race applied this 
time around to Vice President Al 
Gore. 

On Saturday, Bush did it 
again , telling the audience at the 
ann ual conference of the 
Christian Coalition, "Like 
Ronald Reagan, I believe that the 
freedom we cherish ultimately 
depends on the values our fami -
lies teach ." 

The timing is interesting. The 
upcoming series of debates -
like the election itself - pits 
Bush, who has long assumed that 

he has a personality advantage, 
against Gore, who taps a seem-
ingly greater command of policy 
details. 

Republican officials with ties to 
the Bush campaign note that one 
of Bush's best hopes in the 
debates is to trump his opponent 
with charm, conviction and an 
aura of authentic and affable lead-
ership, much as Reagan did. 

They could listen to 
Ronald Reagan, who 
once said, "You can't be 
for big government, big 
bureaucnuy, and still be 
for the little guy. /I 

In an interview with MSNBC 
around the same time, Bush 
responded to a question about 
why some people label him a 
"lightweight" by mentioning 
Reagan. 

"I take great comfort in the fact 
that they said the same thing 
about President Ronald Reagan: 

Bush said. 
And Bush quoted Reagan in 

Friday's energy speech, they said, 
because Bush's argument against 
Gore was so much like the one 
Reagan had made against Carter, 
who emphasized conserving 
energy over expanding the sup-
ply. 

Like Reagan , Bush is trying to 
sell an electorate that does not 
necessarily prefer his positions 
and policies on the idea that he 
would be a bener, more opti-
mistic, more inspiring leader. 

Reagan talked about "morning 
in America"; Bush occasionally 
quotes a Texas artist who talked 
about living on "the sunrise side 
of the mountain." 

• Like Reagan, Bush is selling a 
sweeping tax cut as economically 
healthy, and after Reagan pushed 
such a measure through, the 
economy did improve. 

Bush has repeatedly credited 
that development as the well-
spring of today's prosperity, 
neglecting to mention that federal 
debt ballooned.

Rights: 
Britain does not have a 
written constitution 
ContI ..... froIII ..... 1 
ture." said Julian Knowles, an inter-
national human rights lawyer at 
Matrix, a law firm in London. He 
said that England would now have 
a written bill of rights enshrined in 
a single document and containing 
the same sort of guarantees that 
Americans have had since 1791 . 

As far back as 1215, Magna 
Carta began to define the limits of 
the powers of Britons' rulers. But 
Britain does not have a written 
constitution, nor an American-
style bill of rights. Instead, its citi-
zellS have always had what are 
known as negative rights - that is, 
they have been allowed to do any-
thing they wanted, unless there was 
a law specifically forbidding it. 

"We've never had positive 
rights." said Jenny Watson, deputy 
director of the Human Rights Act 
Research unit at Kings College 
London. "We've always relied on 
the silence of the law - if the law 
doesn't say that you can't do it, you 
can do it. But we started finding 
that rights we thought we had were 
cut back." 

But the human rights law, which 

- David Barstow 
The New York TImes 

the Labor party championed in 
opposition and which became a 
central part of its legislative pro-
gram when it came into power in 
1997, has provoked an enormous 
amount of controversy as the coun-
try prepares for it to take effect .. 

The judicial system is bracang 
itself for a flood of new legal chal-
lenges to laws governing areas like 
the news media, employment prac-
tices, the immigration service, and 
the criminal justice system. And 
the government has been furiously 
preparing for the law's effect by 
training its judges and sening aside 
60 million pounds to pay for the 
new cases. 

Many conservatives are terrified 
that it will wreak havoc with many 
of Britain's treasured institutions, 
giving too much power to interest 
groups like gays, minorities, crimi-
nals and women at the expense of • 
government authority. 

"In almost all areas of our law, 
there are particular issues that peo-
ple wi I) want to challenge using the 
human rights act as a new tool." 
said Anne Owers, director of 
Justice, a British human rights 
group. "But nobody really knows 
how it's all going to fall out. It's 
going to be quite a shake-up."

Electronic Signatures Become valid for Many Business Uses 
Soon, customers who walk into 

the Charles Schwab brokerage 
office in Midtown Manhattan will 
see a small, mauve pad linked to a 
desktop PC that accepts electronic 
versions of a signature. 

The system, which Schwab 
plans to begin using at an undis-
closed date, is one of the seemingly 
humble ways that consumers and 
businesses will begin a new era in 
the . transition from old-fashioned 
pen-on-paper signatures to those 
that can be electronically created 
and stored. 

A bill signed by President 
Clinton on June 30 that granted e-
signatures the same legal standing 

as traditional "wet" ones goes into 
effect Monday. 

The effect, businesses pledge, is 
a new world of e-commerce that is 
faster, cheaper and less vulnerable 
to fraud. 

"It's truly a watershed event: 
said Guido DiGregorio, president 
and chief executive of the 
Communication Intelligence Corp. 
of Redwood Shores, Calif., which 
deveJoped .!~e system for Schwab. 
"I can do transactions at the speed 
of the Internet, cut costs 50 percent 
- and I'm more secure than I was 
before: 

Under the Electronic Signatures 
in Global Commerce Act, con-

More than 40 states had 
already officially 
recognized some form of 
electronic signature before 
Congress passed 
legislation in June. 
sumers can expect a proliferation 
of competing mechanisms for 
bringing signatures into the digital 
age, from encryption-based "diSital 
signature" systems - essentially 
software that uses scrambled num-
bers to identify a particular person 

- to the simple signing mechanism 
at Schwab, which updates ancient 
and familiar practices. 

Bryan Keene, an analyst at 
Prudential Securities Inc., esti-
mates that electronic and digital 
signatures will lead to 80 percent of 
all financial transactions being 
completely automated in the next 
five years. 

More than 40 states had ~Iready 
officially recogniud some fonn of 
electronic signatures before 
Congress passed legislation in 
June. but the federal imprimatur is 
expected to give the technologies a 
boost toward making them part of 
the way consumers do business. 

Although the new technolo-
gies have been given greater legal 
weight under the new federal law, 

.' consumers need not play the e-
signatures game. Under the terms 
of the legislation, consumers have 
a choice as to whether to sign 
their contracts with a pen or a 
elick. 

·If you're not comfortable with 
closing a deal online, don't do it: 
advised Frank Torres, the legislative 
counsel at Consumers Union, the 
advocacy organization that pub-
lishes Consumer Reports.

DIIIt A credit card vendor entices English transfer students Karen SaJtt and SIt/J4 Sims to 
sign WeUs Fargo CTI!dit card applications. 

Credit: 
Some proceeds are 
returrze# to the college 

Knon said that there are some 
differences between the operating 
procedures of his organization and ' 
those of Steve'$. 

"We're paid hourly," he said, 
"and a percentage o( the profits 
from this card are returned to the 
school for scholarship programs 
and funding." 

. Knon also pointed to the school 
itself for "pushing credit cards on 
students." 

"When you buy something at' 
the bookstore, you get an applica-
tion for a Discover Card: he said. 

The vendor fair, at which the 
credit card companies have booth 
space. is held during the first full 

week of every quarter. It is adminis-
tered by the Student Organizations 
and Leadership Op~rtunities 
office, which selects the vendors and 
charges rent for the booths. ,ranging 
from $175 to $375 for the week 
depending on the size of the space. 

The proceeds from this event 
pay the operating costs of the office. 
according to Nildti Cayanan, student 
organizations advisor and campus-
wide event coordinator for SOLO. 

Cayanan said the credit card 
vendors' presence at the fair is not 
necessarily desired by the office, 
and that any space left in the 
absence of the credit card vendors 
could be filled very quickly by 
another business. 

"We'll be having a meeting to dis-
cuss whether or not we want to limit 
it to the UCSD Alumni Association 
card only," she said. "We prefer to 
have them because a portion of their 
profits go back to the school."

IT'S GREEK 
TO E 

GREEK ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDE 
STUDENTS WITH MORE THAN JUST 

SOCIAL OPPORTUNITIES 
MLetters, letters everywhere" 

describes the scene well as students 
waded into a Greek sea in the Price 
Center last week for Fall Rush, the 
week when many fraternities and 
sororities congregate at UCSO's 
most popular hangouts to advertise 
what they can offer to students. 

According to Laura Weiner, the 
student organizations advisor, there 
are currently eight national sorori-
ties recognized by the National 
Panhellenic Association and 11 
national fraternities recognized by 
the National Interfraternity Coucil 
on campus. 

Besides the national fraternities, 
students have also started many 
other fraternities and sororities that 
are unique to our campus. 

So what exactly is the purpose of 
having Greek life at UCSD? Says 
Marshall sophomore McQuire Cho, 
a member of new fraternity Pi Alpha 
Phi, which has an Asian-American 
focus, "Greek life is a whole other 
world. It is something that you will 
never be a part of unless you are in 
an actual frate.rnity or sorority." 

According to senior Adriana 

Padilla-Ravenga of the Latino 
sorority Phi Lambda Rho, being a 
part of Greek life is like having a 
family away from home. 

"A lot of us are away from home. 
and family is a very important part of 

liThe purpose of having 
a Greek system is to 
have a subcommittee 
within college and to 
facilitate meeting people, 
because classes don't 
provide you this 
opportunity to get to. 
know other people. "

Pi Alpha Phi member 

our life: she said. "So when we say 
sisterhood, we feel like this is our 
fam ily on campus. It's like a family 
for us, it's not like an organization." 

In addition to the fam ily aspect, 

many people join because they 
want to meet new people. 

"The purpose of having a Greek 
system is to have a subcommittee 
within college and to facilitate meet-
ing people, because classes don't 
provide you this opportunity to get 
to know other people." said Matt 
Gong, a third-year Marshall student 
and member of Pi Alpha Phi. 

While it is true that people can 
meet people through other club . 
organizations, Warren junior 
Young Kim, who is a member of 
the Psi Chi Omega fraternity, 
thinks that it is especially hard to 
become close friends with the peo-
ple in clubs because of the size of 
the organizations. Because there 
are only between 20 and 30 men in 
a fraternity at one time, one 
becomes closer to those people. 

Agreeing with Kim, Marshall 
junior and Kappa Zeta Phi member 
Hee-Seon Eun remembers her 
experience of bonding with her 
sorority sister: '

The Editor's Soapbox 
An editor recalls the challenges involved in growing up with two dramatically distinct cultures 
Iy MALAVIKA UNCIOLLY 

. Associate Features Editor 

When I tell most people that I 
am Indian, I usually get", look of 
disbelief. Why is it so hard to 
believe? Dark brown hair, brown 
eyes and a name that is obviously 
not of American origin. Why, then, 
is it so difficult to believe that just 
because I do not possess an accent 
similar to ·the stereotypical Indian, 
like Apu from the Simpsons, that I 
am not of Indian descent? 

No, my parents do not own a 7-
11 - my mother is a doctor and 
my father is a college professor. My 
family members do not wear·tur-
bans; we are Hindu, not Sikh. Most 
of my family members have fair 
skin, many with blue and green 
eyes, causing people to think that 
we are of European descent. No 
olle in my immediate family has an 
Indian accent. 

The truth is that my parents 
have lived in this coun ry for 
almost 30 years, meaning that they 
have spent more time living here 
than in India. 

I do not mean to offend anyone 
whose parents own a 7-11 , wear 
turbans or speak with a thick 
accent, as there is nothing wrong 
with this. I am simply arguing that 
not all Indians possess these traits. 

My point here is to illustrate 
some of the stereotypes that have 
been created about Indians, in the 
hope of understanding where peo-
ple like me fit into the scheme of 
things. 

True, America is a melting pot 
of cultures, but sometimes [ feel as 
though I have one foot grounded 

in American soil and one in Indian 
soil, and in the midst of it all, [ do 
not completely fit into either of the 
societies. 

Let me explain. My sister and I 
were born and raised here in 
America. However, we were 
immersed not only i n the American 
culture around us, but in the 
Indian culture as well. 

Growing up, my parents insisted 
that I not only learn jazz and ballet, 
but Bharatanatyam, Indian classical 
dance, as well . 

While most of my friends had 
short hair, my hair fell to my waist 
and was kept in a neat braid. 

We did not eat pasta more than 
once a week, but a rice dish - veg-
etarian, of course - was cooked 
nearly every day. 

English and Konk.ani (the 
Indian dialect that my family 
speaks) were used interchangeably 
in our household, and I was 
expected to speak both fluently. 

Early in life, my parents taught 
me of the importance of education, 
and while my friends were ~atch­
ing cartoons at the age of S, my. dad 
and [ would read Shakespeare 
together. 

At a relatively young age, I Start-
ed to resent the meshing of these 
two completely different cultures, 
and [ began to rebel. When my par-
ents would speak to me in our 
native tongue, [ would respond in 
English, [ would refuse to eat any-
thing other than pizza and, much 
to my mother's displeasure, [ 
chopped off my hair into a short 
bob the first chance [ got, 

[ was tired of all the extra work, 
and of trying so hard lo understand 

True, America .is a 
melting pot of cultures, 
but sometimes I feel as 
though I have one foot 
grounded in American 
soil and one in Indian 
soil, and in the midst of 
it all, I do not completely 
fit into either of the 
societies. 
both cultures so well. Being one of 
the only minorities in my elemen-
tary school was hard enough - it 
just seemed easier to be like the 
rest of my friends. 

I did not fully understand the 
consequences of what I was doing 
until I reached high school. During 
one of my family's trips to India, [ 
was angered when one of my 
cousins referred to me as an 
American, as though [ had no con-
nection with the culture that they 
had grown up with. [n India, my 

relatives only spoke to me in 
English, and even tried cooking 
American dishes (with an Indian 
twist) when we visited. To this day, 
it makes me ill to think of the 
"macaroni masala" that was pre-
pared for our visits. 

It was then that [ began to real-
ize that by pushing away the cul-
ture my parents had tried so hard 
to teach us, [ was not only alienat-
ing myself from my family, but I 
was rejecting my identity as well. It 
is bad enough to feel cheated, but 
even worse is the feeling that you 
cheated yourself. Indians refer to 
my condition as that of being an 
"ABCD" (American-born confused 
Desi, "Desi" meaning Indian). I 
knew about both cultures but did 
not fit into either of them. 

I realize that this must seem 
strange to most, and understand-
ably so. Many of my close friends 
who are not of Indian origin felt 
that some of our customs were 
strange, just because these customs 
were foreign to the traditions they 
were accustomed to practicing. 

On Fridays, my family would 
complete our weekly pooja, a reli-
gious ritual, which included keep-
ing a 24-hour fast. While most of 
my friends would attend church on 
Sundays, I would attend Balvihar, a 
class designed to teach children 
about the Indian culture and the 
Hindu religion. In high school, I 
had many male friends but was not 
allowed to date. 

I still remember the discussion 
my mom and I had when I became 
upset about having to comply with 
these rules. She stressed the impor-
tance of being independent, and

urged me to pursue my education-
al goals before all else. She would 
often say, "Learn to be independent 
and stand on your own feet, so that 
you will never have to depend on 
someone else for material things: 

Although my parents would 
never arrange a marriage for me, 
they also wanted me to wait until I 
was older and more mature to be 
involved in a serious relationship. 
This mentality was difficult for me 
to understand, but now I can see 
why my parents raised me in such a 
manner. They were simply trying to 
provide me with the basic values 
characteristic of the Indian culture. 
In other words, they were trying to 
make me a more worldly person, 
and in rejecting the culture that 
was so dear to them, it was almost 
as though I had given up a part of 
myself in the process. 

What had I done? Now, rather 
than encompassing the best parts 
of two diverse cultures, I realized 
that I knew virtually nothing about 
either one. Simply put. it was a Stu-
pid mistake that I have come to 
regret. Luckily. [ learned my lesson 
early in life, and was able to repair 
the damage before I became com-
pletely alienated from the Indian 
culture. 

I began by working to relearn 
the language that I had refused to 
speak for so long. Initially, whenev-
er I attempted to speak, I was faced 
with the task of overcoming a 
strong American accent. My sister 
would laugh and claim that I was 
speaking Konkani like a "gora" 
would, "gora" meaning American.

Initial stereotypes are 
often subjed to change 
Continued 'rom pa •• 11 
Eun said. "It builds strong friend-
ships tha t you would never have 
because you spend so much time 
with the other girls. It definitely 
brings bonds among friends ," 

Marshall senior Steve Mackey, 
a member of Delta Sigma Phi, 
believes that it is especially hard 
for people to get excited on the 
UCSD campus, especially since 
UCSD is so research oriented. 

"Inter-fraternity sports and 
parties are something you get 
really excited about at a school 
that is not very exciting," Mackey 
said. "As fun as the Stuart Art 
Collection is, you are not going to 
sit and stare at it on a Friday 
night. If I were at UCLA, I propa-
bly wouldn't have gone Greek. I 
think that at this place, it's some-
thing that you almost need to do 
to have some fun and have some-
thing to do all the time." 

Mackey also observes that 
. unlike other colleges, UCSD has 

no houses for its fraternities and 
sororities, which make it very dif-
ficult for them to have parties and 
hold events. Communities like La 
Jolla usually frown upon such 
activities, making it even harder for 
Greek organizations to function as 
they do on other campuses. 

Mackey said the San Diego 
Police Department has been 
implementing anti-noise and anti-
party programs that restrict Greek 
organizations' activities. 

Despite all this, Cho and 
Mackey believe that the mo.st 
attractive benefit of joining a fra-
ternity or sorority is that it can be 
helpful even after graduation, 

"Once you get out of college, 
you need connections," Cho said. 
"I went to a seminar the other day, 

and I realized that our fraternity, 
Pi Alpha Phi, has a lot of promi-
nent alumni that will help you get 
into the work force," 

Mackey added that Greek life 
helps people become socially adept. 

"I know that people that are 
si tting in their dorm rooms are 
not learning (social skills) . I know 
that I am going to go out, get a 
good job in the real world, and not 
worry about it; whereas many 
people that are sitting in their 
dorm rooms are stressed." 

One may wonder how real the ' 
stereotypes of Greek life on in the 
media reflect what is actually 
shown in real life. Common 
stereotypes include students con-

"It seems that people 
here are anti-Greek and 
anti-anything that 
doesn't involve studying. 
I think they take a 
negative view of people 
who are having fun. 1/ 

-st.v ....... , 
Delta Sigma Phi member 

stantly 'drinking and partying, not 
studying and getting kicked out of 
school. Of course, these are just 
stereotypes, 

According to Mackey, "It 
seems that people here are anti-
Greek and anti-anything that 
doesn't involve studying. I think 
they take a negative view on peo-
ple who are having fun." 

Warren junior Cliff Leong, 
who is a member of Lambda Phi 
Epsilon, agrees, 

"Overcoming stereotypes are 
hard because people think we 
party all day and it's not all like ' 
that; Leong said. "We are either 
doing a service or concentrating 
on our brotherhood." 

The UCSD Guardian 

Another type of stereotype gen-
erally held is that people usually 
change once they become an active 
me mber of a fraternity or sorority, 

Marshall senior and member 
of Sigma Nu Michael Escoto dis-
agrees, 

"I don 't think I've changed ," 
Escoto said. "I think that if you 
come into this school one way 
and come out another, hopefully 
it's the result of you learning 
something about life and being 
older, But if you're changing 
because of a fraternity, you proba-
bly shouldn't join one." 

On the other hand, Gong feels 
that being in a Greek organization 
can change a person for the better, 

"I've gotten more confident, 
learned time management much 
better, and overall how to balance 
my social life with academics; he 
said, "You don't need to sit in your 
room all day and study to be suc-
cessful in college." 

Common questions students 
ask are generally regarding the 
process, cost and time commit-
ment of joining a Greek organiza-
tion. These questions and more 
are answered during Rush Week, 
which is when students get to 
know the other members of the 
fraternity or sorority. This is also 
when the members know the 
interest level of the student. 

"They arc not obligated to any-
thing when they rush," Leong 
said. "Rush is just a way for them 
to get to know more about the fra-
ternity and sorority." 

From there, rushees may 
receive a bid, which is an invitation 
to pledge the sorority or fraternity. 
Then students go through a pledge 
period of anywhere between a few 
weeks to two quarters, depending 
on the organization. Finally, 
pledges who complete the pledge 
process become active members of 
the fraternity or sorority,

this week the lesson is to get along

Perseverance gets an important

your sweetheart or a child against

however. Don 't argue with your sig-

Greek: 
Student safety is a 
priority 
ContInued frGm ..... 14 

Although hazing is an all-too-
frequent part of the pledge process 
for many Greek organizations 
nationwide, UCSD fraternities and 
sororities claim to be different. 

Warren junior Richard Choi. 
who is the rush chair of Pi Kappa 
Alpha, explained, "[ personally 
don't believe in hazing. Forcing 
someone to do what they don't 
want to do, I believe, is wrong, 
especially when this is a club where 
you are volunteering your time." 

As for cost and time commit-
ment, ~Costs are a little steeper as 
compared to other clubs, but time 
commitment is on average about 
four hours a week; Choi said. 
"However, times and cost are com-
pletely optional. You can do as 
much as you want, but you can 
also do as little as you want." 

A prevalent issue that is appar-
ent on every campus regarding 
Greek life is the_ problem with 
underage drinking, particularly

"Well, we don't promote it, but 

it's a fact that San Diego is so close

Choi added, U[ think drinking

common thing among students, 
safety measures arc implemented 
by Greek organizations to ensure 
the safety of all students. 

"There are people who associate 
with students to make sure every-
one is safe," Choi said. "Also, there 
are liability reasons at UCS D that 
will keep students safe. [t is always 
good to have safety measures." 

There are many words of advice 
given by UCSD fraternities and 
sororities in making the decision 
about joining one. 

Chong advised, "Check out the 
Greek system. Just talk to people 
and don't just believe in what other 
people say about stereotypes." 

Ravega also gave her advice, say-
ing, "Really think about it. There is 
a lot of time commitment, but it is 
worth it. Don't just do it because of 
the name."

Greek system may not be for every-

outcome looks positive. Don't be 
intimidated; that will just make the 
job take longer. A conflict with an 
authority figure on Wednesday or 
Thursday could make you feel anx-
ious. You're being tested to see if 
YOll can handle more responsibili-
ty. Show your calm under pressure, 
and you'll make a great impression. 

u .... (Sept. 23-0ct. 23) 
Travel is confusing on Monday 

and Tuesday. You can make it 
through, but probably not without 
white knuckles. The overall out-
come's positive Wednesday and 
Thursday, too. Keep thal in mind 
when you start to feel over-
whelmed. Also, keep a secret. Take 
a romantic gift to the one you love 
on Sunday. That would not only be 
thoughtful, but wise. 

........ (Oct. 24·Nov. 21) 
Pass on a great deal that a friend 

tells you about on Monday. Spend 
the money on your home, instead. 
A technical breakdown on Friday 
could have you out shopping for a 
new gadget over the weekend. 
Don't go for the bells and whistles. 
Get the one that will hold up best 
mechanically. 

On Monday your presentation 
of a new idea gets nothing but 
arguments. Don't be dissuaded. 
You can convince everybody with 
facts, plus your own natural charm. 
If you're a little short on informa-
tion, Tuesday's good for finding 
what you need. You'd better not 
procrastinate. Somebody's apt to 
ask for it before Wednesday is over. 
Ask tough questions to get the 
most out of that investment. By 
Sunday you may have a new point 
of view to add to your collection. 

c.prIconI (Dec. 22·Jan. 19) 
You're getting mixed messages 

concerning work on Monday. That 
might be due to changes happen-
ing there. That's a terrible day to 
travel, by the way. People will make 
unexpected lane changes, too. If 
you've presented this well, ask for a 
raise on Friday. You have a chance 
at it, so don't botch the opportuni-
ty. An argument with a friend about 
money could mar an otherwise 
lovely Saturday. Don't make a big 
deal of it and don't loan this person 
much, either. Take 'em out to 
breakfast on Sunday instead, and 
figure the debt is paid. • 

..... (Jan. 2(}Feb. 18) 
On Monday and Tuesday offer a 

friend your shoulder to cry on. He or 
she is going through a confusing 
metamorphosis. From where you're 
standing. the answers look simple. 
Follow through on an agreement 
you've made on Wednesday. On 
Sunday do something extra special 

The UCSD Guardian 

with a friend who shares your inter-
ests and beliefs. 

. PI_ (Feb. 19-March 20) 
You're in the middle of the activ-

ity on Monday. Everybody is sure 
pushing their own agenda. Be the 
moderator. Schedule a relaxing . 
evening with friends Tuesday. By 
then you'll- need it. Get an older 
friend together with your partner on 
Wednesday. Together, they'll solve a 
tough puzzle. Don't be afraid to 
make a mess' to get what you want. 
It may take two or th ree tries. 

......., ....... ... 
Oct. 2: You can discover some- . 

thing valuable in your neighbor-
hood and also visit distant shores. 
Start with a shopping list. 

Oct. 3: You're into the books 
this year, so learn something useful, 
like how to tum your home into a 
personal paradise. 

Oct. 4: Flights of fancy instill 
passion, but good sense keeps you 
grounded. It's a winning combina-
tion. 

Oct. 5: You and a roommate may 
quarrel, but the overall outcome is 
good. Make your opinion known. 

Oct. 6: You're in love, or soon 
will be. You're luck,y, too, so what 
can you make happen? 

Oct. 7: This year you're lookin' 
good and gaining friends. Don't let 
money, or a lack of it, interfere. 

Oct. 8: Don't let your great atti-
tude make you overoptimistic. 
Don't spend more than you have, 
just for the fun of it.

but it has also enabled me to better 
understand thc reasons behind 
cultural adapration, 

I know that many minorities are 
faced with the same issues that I 
faced as a child and continue to 
face today. The only advice [ can 
offer is that you should never 
ignore your roots, because culture 
is what defines us as individuals.

when I tell them that [ am Indian. 
But now I have the ability to gently 
point out that not everyone is the 
mirror image of their culture's 
stereotype. 

I may have been born and 
brought up in America, but my val-
ues are inherently Indian. I do not 
know everything there is to know 
about my culture, but I actually 
prefer it that way, because it means 
that I continue to learn new things 
every day. 

[ can now look at these stereo-
types and not only refute them, but 
rake them in a lighthearted manner. 
Although I do not possess an accent 
as entertaining as Apu's, [ could 
probably do a pretty darn good 
impersonation if [ wanted to,

Chargers: 
Team denies Guardian 
access 

to win. 
The Chargers have given prob-

lems to other pJJblications, namely 
Internet sports sites. It wants 
Internet stories to come only from 
its site. Talk about overcontrol of 
coverage. 

The Chargers are making a big 
mistake by not leuing the Guardian 
cover its games. We have many 
readers who are the ones that will 
be anending Chargers games in the 
years to come. 

Not that anyone will want to. 

V~II: 
Tritons also down 
Dominguez Hills 
ConIIa .............. .. 

The bright spots for Grand 
Canyon were few and far between, 
but the play of both jessica jones, 
who had a match-high tally of 17 
kills and 24 digs, and jean 
Wiechertjes, who had 10 kills and 
15 digs, at least gave the visitors 
something to cheer about. 

On Friday night the lritons 
traveled north to Carson to go head 
to head with Cal State University 
Dominguez Hills in another 
important CCAA match. 

The match was intense from 
the start, with hard-hitting action 
from both teams. It went to four 
games before the Tritons, led once 
again by the outstanding play of 
Santerre, emerged victorious with a 
3-1 win. 

The victory was well-fought for 
despite adversity,- according to the 
Tritons' Christine Kueneman. 

"We came out a bit slow 
against Dominguez Hills, but we 
got it together and picked it up to 
beat them in the end: Kueneman 
said. 

On Saturday night the team 
traveled to Los Angeles to face the 
undefeated, conference-leading Cal 
State University Los Angeles team. 
The Thtons played them tough, 
but fell in three games. 

According to Kueneman, the 
score does not reflect the action. 

"The whole team played well 
against Los Angeles: she said. ·We 
had them 14-11 at one point in the 
second set and if we could . have 
closed that out, momentum would 
have shifted, but we didn't, and 
that really affected the match. We 
were close in every game and gave 
them their toughest challenge of

Alfredson: Heartbreak Hero 
From a great height, Triton soccer player Erika Alfredson is playing 
forward this year and helping UCSD adjust and thrive in Division II 
By .SAAC PIAIILMAN 
Contributing Staff Writer 

It's amazing the difference two 
years can make. After a devastat-
ing loss to the College of St. 
Benedict in 1998, then-freshman 
defender Erika Alfredson was 
reduced to tears when a pass she 
was defending bounced off her 
and an opposing player into the 
goal to give St. Benedict the win. 

"I felt so guilty, the ball went 
off me and went in the goal - I 
thought I'd never recover: 
Alfredson said. 

An all-out passionate player, 
the loss was devastating for 
Alfredson . 

"After the team was knocked 
out of the playoffs she was going 
to quit : said Head Coach Brian 
McManus. "She thought it was 
her fault they lost ." 
.. Fortunately for UCSD, 

Alfredson decided to keep playing 
and was instrumental in the 
Tritons' playoff run last year. 

She scored the lone goa l in 
th e champio nship game vs. 
Macalaster College, earning 
offensive MVP and AII-
Tournament honors on the way 
to a national championship for 
the Tritons. 

This year, the 20-yt;ar-old 
junior leads the team in total 
points through seven games, and 
already has more goals than ~er 
total from last year. 

Alfredson and McManus cred-
it this turnaround to her changing 
position from defender to mid-
fielder last year and to forward 
this year. 

"Part of it is position, since last 

year I was a midfielder: Alfredson 
said. "I'm also putting myself in 
bener position this year, and mak-
ing better runs." 

McManus cites Alfredson's 
height. 5'10·, and her quick feet 
as assets that give her an advan-
tage over other players. 

"She's great at taking defend-
ers one-on-one and getting 
behind them," McManus said. 

"My goal is for our 
team· to win conference, 
make the playoffs, and 
to make it to the Final 
Four next year. " 

-EituAlfr ...... 
Women 's soccer player 

"However' when she's knocked 
down, with her long legs she 
looks like Bambi falling down." 

With five goals through seven 
games,. Alfredson is not missing 
her old position as defender, 
which she chose only to get some 
playing lIIne. 

"Freshmall year we needed 
defenders, and since there were 
nine freshmen and nine return ing 
I said I would play defense," 
Alfredson said. "I volunteered 
because I JUSt wanted to play." 

Alfredson acknowledges her 
competitiveness as her primary 
motivation factor. 

" I hate to lose; it's the worst 
feeling in the world," she said. 

Her will to win is evident to 
her appreciative teammates and 
coaches. 

"If YOlt give her a job, she fol-
lows it through to the letter." 
McManus praised. 

"She's just good," added fresh-
man goalie Kami Poma. "She does 
her job well." 

Alfredson 's hard work and 
personal incentive inspired her 
during the playoffs last year and 
allowed her to savor the victory 
even more. 

"Seeing her face after she won 
a national championship was 
great," McManus said. "Especially 
after the tough loss in the first 
round the year before." 

The Palo Alto native has been 
competitive since childhood. She 
recalled one instance when, at age 
7, she packed only two left shoes 
for a soccer tournament. She 
ended up wearing them both and 
winning the tournament. 

After Alfredson graduates from 
UCSD, she plans to study child 

. psychology in gradua te school 
back East. most likely in Boston . 
For now, however, she remains 
focused on soccer. 

"My goal is for our team to win 
conference, make the playoffs, and 
to make it to the f'lI1al Four next 
year," Alfredson said. 

Despite her impressive .offen- -
sive numbers, she is not com-
pletely satisfied with her overall 
game. 

"Individually, I need to work 
on my composure and mental 
toughness: Alfredson said. "I 
think that's something our whole 
team needs to work on." 

With her impressive work 
ethic as a model , the team should 
have an e)Ccellent chance of 
accomplishing its goals. 

Olympics: 
Thorpe, Johnson capture 
gold 
ContInued from PIll_ 24 
championship game after losing 
to it earlier in the tourney. It was 
the men's first gold medal. 

Women's softball won gold in 
Atlanta and was picked to win 
gold again in Sydney, as it had a 
two-year winning streak coming 
into the games. Its chances at 
gold, and even a medal , were put 
in doubt when it lost three 
games in a row, but Lisa 
Fernandez and the rest of the 
team showed what they were 
made of as they won out to take 
the gold medal. 

Stacy Draglia of the United 
States won the inaugural 
women's pole vault and was the 
only woman to break 15 feet at 
the Olympics. 

Maurice Greene took the 100 
and helped the United States win 
the 400-meter relay. but then he 
and his 400-meJcr teammates tar-
nished the games and themselves 
by goofing off on the podium 
during the anthem. showing no 
respect for what they or others 
had done. 

Australian Cathy Freeman, of 
Aboriginal descent, won the 400 
and actrd as a symbol of recon-
ciliation for a divided nation . 
There is tension between the 
Aborigines and whites of 
Australia, and Freeman's vicrory, 
at least in the U.S. press, repre-
sented a bridge between these 
two factions. 

One of the biggest surprises of 
the game was the trouble the U.S. 
men's basketball team had. Ever 
since NBA players have started 
competing in the Olympics. they 
have never lost a game and have 
never won a game by less than 22 
points. 

SPORTS 23 

The U.S. team, which included 
players such as Vince Carter, Ray 
Allen and Kevin Garnet , beat 
Lithuania by only two pOints 111 
these games. Moreover, 
Lithuania's two N BA players were 
injured and could not play. Later 
in the championship game. the 
United States had trouble with 
Fra nce and ended up winning by 
10. 

So yes, the United States did 
win the gold - but come on, 
guys, you don't get paid $10 mil-
lion a year just to get by. On the 
other hand, it would be interest-
ing to see how a bunch of NBA 
players would react to losing to a 
team like Albania. 

Unlike the men 's team, the 
women's basketball team. led by 
Lisa Leslie, had no trouble dis-
patching its opponents to win the 
gold medal. 

By far the biggest upset of the 
Olympics was Rulon Gardner's 
defeat of Alexander Karelin in 
Greco-Roman wrestling. 

Kardin has achieved a domi-
nation in this sport , the likes of 
which have never been seen . He 
had not lost a match in 13 years 
and had been scored on only 
twice. This streak spans hundreds 
of matches and is the equivalent 
of a pitcher going a whole season 
and giving up something like a 
minuscule two runs. 

Rulon brought hi s reign 
cra shlllg down and ended 
Karelin 's hope of becoming the 
first man ever to win a gold medal 
in four consecutive games. 

Beyond indiVidual events, the 
United States won the medal 
count, 97 to 88, over its age-old 
Olympic nemesis Russia. Host 
country Austra lia came in fourth 
with 58. 

These Olympic games have 
been a success. Every athlete who 
competed deserves recognition 
for the work he has put in to get 
there. On to Athens!

Chargers' 
slight is their 
own loss 

ROBERT FULTON 

1: he San Diego Chargers think they are too good for us. es, the same Chargers that are 
currently 0-5. The same team that 
could not sell out its stadium by 
giving tickets away. The same fran-
chise that is at one of the lowest 
points in its hiStory. 

These people think they are 
better than us here at UCSD. 

We at Guardian Sports try to 
bring a wide variety of articles to 
our readers. We generally cover 
things on campus, but sometimes 
we like to venture out to other 
events. 

The Chargers are a part of San 
Diego culture and permeate the 
entire area . Being part of that area, 
we thought it would be nice to 
cover a couple of games, take a 
couple of photos and do a feature 
story or two. 

Well , no can do, folks. 
Our request for press creden-

tials to go and cover the games was 
denied. Shot down. No soup for us. 

Why were we denied? The 
Chargers' media relations gave two 
excuses. 

The first was that the press 
booth was full, that there was no 
room to grant further credentials. 

No room? Hell, who would 
really want to show up anyway? 
The team is awful. Maybe people 
will show up to see the creative 
ways in which the Chargers will 
lose. . 

The second excuse for not giv-
ing us credentials was that they do 
not typically give out credentials to 
COllege papers. Their reasoning is 
that we do not reach the demo-
graphic of readers they really want 
to reach out to. 

The person I talked to said they 
get more bang for their buck from 
other publications. Our readers are 
not able to purchase their season 
tickets. 

The Guardian has a circulation 
of 11,000. There are over 20,000 
students at this campus. Someone 
will being reading our coverage. 

Right now, maybe we at UCSD 
cannot afford to buy season tickets 
to the Chargers' games (not that we 
would really want to), b~ on this 
campus lie future movers and 
shakers. Five or 10 years from now, 
we will not be buying Chargers sea-
son tickets. We will be renting 
those luxury suites. That is, if we 
choose too. 

The Chargers gave the Guardian 
two alternatives. We could go to 
either a preseason game or we 
could attend a practice. 

Attending a preseason game 
does not help us much . Our school 
year does not start and the 
Guardian does not publish until 
September. Preseason is long over 
by then . 

Attending a practice would be a 
slap in the face. Why would we 
want to do that when we wanted to 
attend a real game? Perhap it's 
because at a practice where San 
Diego's defense and offense play 
each other, the Chargers are bound

Staff Writer ' 

For the past two weeks in 
Sydney, the best athletes from 
every nation have competed on 
the world's most hallowed of 
stages, the Olympic stage, and 
given their all to win the ulti-
mate athletic accomplishment: a 
gold medal. 

As the games of 2000 draw 
to a close, it is time to reflect on 
what the participants in these 
games have achie.ved. 

Michael Johnson did indeed 
win the 400-meter dash, 
although not in world record 
time. As he pulled up lame in 
the 200-meter dash at the 
Olympic trials, he was not able 

The UCSD Guardian 

to repeat his historic double of 
Atlanta 1996. He also won a 
gold in the 1600-meter relay. 

Marion Jones sought five 
gold medals at Sydney but won 
only three - still , not too shab-
by. She also won two bronzes. A 
pall was cast over her victories, 
though , as her husband C.j. 
Hunter was caught in the mid-
dle of a drug scandal. 

The much-hyped show-
down between the U.s-. and 
Australian swim teams turned 
into a much-hyped tail-whip-
ping, as the United States 
dominated in almost every 
swimming event and won 33 
medals, including 14 golds to 
Australia's 18 medals and five 
golds. The world got its first 

glance of Ian Thorpe, nick-
named "the Thorpedo: at 
these games and it liked what it 
saw. 

With his size 17 feet , the 
Thorpedo swims like a fish and 
set one world record while 
being"3 part of another. He did 
lose the 200-meter freestyle to 
Peiter Van Hoogenband, an 
event he was overwhelmingly 
favored in, but the boy is only 
17. He has time. 

The U.S. men's baseball 
team and U.S. women's softball 
team won gold in Sydney. The 
men's team, guided by Tommy 
Lasorda, former manager of the 
L.A. Dodgers, beat Cuba in the

Tritons Rule the Range, Skin the Antelopes 3-1 
After a tough first set, the women's volleyball team defeated Grand Canyon in four sets 
By ICon BURROUGHS 
Staff Writer 

UCSD mixed standout indi-
vidual performances with solid 
all-around team play to overcome 
a tough first-game loss and take 
the win Wednesday night at 
RlMAC Arena. 

The Tritons looked very com-
fortable on their home turf, 
making few mistakes while mix-
ing in some flashy digs to beat 
its very competent opponent, 
Arizona's Grand Canyon 
University. 

The first set saw a shaky Triton 
squad struggle to find its bearings 
in front of the supportive home-
town crowd. This resulted in a 
tough 11-15 loss, as UCSD just 
could not establish a presence 
against the pumped-up, visiting 
Antelopes. 
_ This all changed when play 

resumed for the second game, as ' 
a rejuvenated Triton team 
bumped, set and spiked its way to 
a 15-9 win. 

The third and fourth games 
were more of the same, with the 
Tritons dominating to the tunc of 

15-9 and 15-6 to clinch the victo-
ry. 

Endurance was key in this 
match, as it had an unusually 
large number of lengthy rallies, 
which culminated in some key 
turning points. 

UCSD was up to this type of 
match, winning many of these 
points to gain and keep momen-
tum throughout. 

The usual suspects came 
through once again for the blue 
and gold, as outside hitters Leslie 
Punelli and Laura Santerre came 
up big in this important 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association faceoff. 

Punelli compiled 11 kills and 
a match-leading 25 digs while 
Santerre had 14 kills and six digs 
for the victorious Tritons. 

Two other UCSD women . 
who had a big impact on the 
match were Kearney Visser, who 
chipped in with 11 kills, 15 digs 
and three total blocks, and 
Jennie Wilson , who kicked down 
11 kills and three blocks of her 
own. Tylir HIIII GudIn
