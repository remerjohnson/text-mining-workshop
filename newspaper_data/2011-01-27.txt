After students were welcomed back with 
133 fewer S parking spots at the beginning 
of Winter Quarter, Sixth College sophomore 
Allison Platt started a petition and Facebook 
group on Jan. 25 to ask for more parking spaces.

“I have a car here on campus and they 
removed a lot of S spots from the Sixth College 
apartment area,” Platt said. “I have to park in 
overflow almost every time I go to campus [and 
I was] fed up with paying a $600 parking pass 
to park so far and have to walk with a friend 
late at night.”

Platt wanted to change the transportation 
system and approached A.S. President Wafa 
Ben Hassine, who suggested she start a petition.

“A lot of students are a little frustrated that 
S spots are being converted to A and B spots 
without the consultation of students and [Platt] 

just wanted to express that,” Ben Hassine said.
Platt is currently working with Ben Hassine 

to move forward with 
the petition.

“I’m going to meet 
with the A.S. president 
to get this issue spoken 
about in A.S., and 
hopefully get our 
resolution in support 
with that and be 
able to bring it to the 
Chancellor,” Platt said. 

 At press time, 
2,296 individuals — 
mostly undergraduate 
students — have signed 
the petition online at 

the  A.S. Council’s website. Platt said she is 
aiming for 22,000 signatures because it is the 
approximate number of undergraduates on 

campus.
“I started the petition [on Tuesday, Jan. 25] 

at 1 p.m.,” Platt said. “Within the first hour, I 
had 200 signatures and within four hours, I 
had 800.”

Over winter break, Transportation and 
Parking Services reallocated and reduced the 
number of parking spots to make room for new 
construction projects, mostly from lots in Sixth 
and Revelle College.

Since A and B spots were reduced, S 
parking spots have taken the hit. Displaced 
S parkers have to park on the East Campus 
parking lots where there are about 1,200 open 
spaces, according to Resource Management 
and Planning Communications director Rex 
Graham.

UCSD neurosurgeon and clinical 
surgery professor William Taylor 
was fined for neglecting to report 
his ties to NuVasive Inc., a company 
that agreed to provide funding for 
four research projects focused on 
testing products for neurosurgery. 
He was charged $12,000 by the Fair 
Political Practices Commission.

Taylor, a specialist in minimally 
invasive spinal surgery at the UCSD 
Medical Center, failed to reveal the 
additional funding when filing his 
required forms to the Fair Political 
Practices Commission. 

It was later discovered that 
Taylor received additional funding 
from NuVasive, a San Diego based 
company that manufactures 
products for spinal disorder 
surgeries.

The state-mandated form 
requires the researcher to disclose 
his or her economic interests in any 
non-governmental funding source.

Taylor claims that he did not 
deliberately conceal the NuVasive’s 
funding and took corrective action 
by discontinuing participation 
in the projects after realizing his 
mistake, according to the FPPC. 

UCSD has recognized Taylor’s 
false declaration as an administrative 
error. He will still, however, have to 
pay a $12,000 fine, as determined by 
the FPPC. Taylor’s fine is $8,000 less 
than the maximum penalty for his 
violations, according to the FPPC. 

“[Taylor] is not going to be 
fired,” Director of Health Sciences 
Press and Media Relations 
Jacqueline Carr said. “No patients 
were affected in his [trials]. The 
case was examined by UCSD, and 
it has been decided that no further 
action will be taken. He is a very 
respected surgeon.”

According to the FPPC, Taylor 
violated the Political Reform Act 
“by failing to disclose certain 
economic interests.” 

Taylor is noted on four counts 
of such failed economic disclosures 
with NuVasive between July 2008 
and Sept. 2009.

Taylor’s first violation was for his 
evaluation of NuVasive neurovision 
dilators in July 2008.  

The second violation took place 
in March 2009, when Taylor used 
NuVasive funds to evaluate the 
clinical use of Pedicle screws, which 
are used to increase spinal stability.  

Taylor’s third research project in 
violation of the FPPC focused on 
evaluating a Lumbar TDR device in 
June 2009.

Higher Cholesterol in HIV Patients Increases Stroke Chances
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

By Sarah Kang
Contributing Writer

New research suggests that the 
risk of strokes may be higher for 
HIV-positive patients.

The HIV medication HAART is 
associated with rises in cholesterol 
levels and weight. A study led by 
neuroscience professor Bruce 
Ovbiagele revealed that, due to the 
increase in cholesterol, HIV patients 
taking this medication had a higher 
incidence of strokes.

Ovbiagele and other researchers 
analyzed medical records from 
1997 to 2006 and found that 
over time, there was a seven-
percent total decrease in the rate 
of hospitalizations due to strokes. 
However, in HIV patients, there 
was a 60-percent increase in stroke-
caused hospitalizations.

“Stroke is not very common 
in HIV patients, but to see such 
a dramatic increase, especially 
when the rest of the population is 
actually having a decrease in their 
stroke rate, was a little bit striking,” 
Ovbiagele said.

There are two different types of 
strokes, hemorrhagic and ischemic. 
Ischemic strokes, which occur when 
cholesterol deposits within blood 
vessels obstruct blood flow to the 
brain, are prevalent in HIV patients 
taking HAART medications. 

The rate of hemorrhagic strokes 
— caused by the weakening and 
subsequent rupturing of blood 
vessels in the brain — did not 
change.   

“Now, the data set did not permit 
us to actually make a cause-and-
effect analysis, so we cannot directly 
say, ‘These medications are definitely 
the cause of the rise in strokes,’” 
Ovbiagele said. “But it is very 
curious that for every other person, 
at least for the general population, 
stroke rates went down at the same 
time, while for HIV patients being 
put on these medications, they went 
up.”

According to Ovbiagele, some 
researchers argued that this could 
be due to the fact that HIV patients 
are now surviving longer in general 
and, as a result, are exposed to more 
conditions that could lead to strokes.

“That’s possible. But the fact that 
just one type of stroke worsened, but 
the other type of stroke stayed the 
same, tends to not support that view 
too much,” Ovbiagele said.

Further studies will be done on 
the rate of heart attacks in HIV 
patients to see if they can reinforce 
this study’s findings, which is an 
ongoing process. 

Researchers are currently 
applying for more funding to start 
up new studies that will add to the

T his week’s meeting began with an introduction by Revelle College Council, who left as 
soon as they said “hi.” I guess they 
didn’t want to overstay their welcome.

Two presentations were given 
last night. The 
first was by 
the Student 
Sustainability 
Collective. Five 
of their members, 
including 
Campuswide 
Senator Elizabeth Elman, spoke 
about upcoming events like the 
Sexual Empowerment Campaign, 
which will include giving out free 
condoms. They also discussed the 
progress of their programs, such as an 
electronic waste collection project and 
a Styrofoam ban in Price Center.

Former ERC and Campuswide 
Senator Alex Vu discussed the future 
of the Student Health Insurance 
Program. UC schools are considering 
the creation of a UC-wide health 
insurance policy. Vu stressed that 
UCSD has a unique health insurance 
program, and incorrectly stated that 
students have 100-percent coverage. 
UCSD is currently updating SHIP 
and considering the adoption of the 
UC-wide program. Vu requested 
feedback from students on what kinds 
of health services they want.

A reading circle for the book 
Barack and a Hard Place will take 
place this Friday at 1 p.m. in Marshall 
College’s Fireside Lounge. It’s the 
first event of the Respect Campaign 
started by the office of Diversity 
Affairs

Sixth College Senator Parminder 
Sandhu answered a question about 
the cash cab, which students might 
have seen around campus, and is from 
the Sixth College Television station. 
You can jump on it, get a ride to class 

and answer trivia for prizes. 
Roosevelt College Senator 

Matthew Bradbury informed council 
about the American Opportunity Tax 
Grant, which gives students $2,000 in 
tax credit for school expenses. 

Campuswide 
Senator Victor 
Flores-Osorio is 
creating an all-
campus dodgeball 
event modeled 
after one that took 
place at UCI. The 

event will occur next quarter.
Campuswide Senator Anish 

Bhayani said TritonLink will be 
revamped once again, this time called 
TritonLink 2.0. Bhanyani said there’s 
currently an online interactive survey 
for students to determine how to 
organize the redesign.

President Wafa Ben Hassine 
said it seems like the proposed 
technology fee won’t go through, 
since both students and faculty 
oppose it. Hassine wrote a letter to 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox and the 
vice chancellors expressing council’s 
concerns about the fee, especially 
the lack of student voice on the 
technology fee committee. 

Ben Hassine also reminded 
council that there are two open spaces 
in council, one on the Judicial Board 
and one as campuswide senator. 

Marshall College Senator Thao 
Pham is working on filling the 
Fireside Lounge with mosaics.

Council went into a closed session 
to discuss the approval of election 
manager Senam Payandeh. She was 
approved by the time the meeting 
opened back up. 

The meeting ended in excitement 
as UCSD foam fingers for basketball 
games were handed out to members 
of council. Who’s got spirit at UCSD, 
you ask? Apparently, council does.

New Insurance Plan Discussed, 
Pres. Says Tech Fee Unlikely

SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

By Alison Gilchrist
Staff Writer

Researchers are testing the 
stability of commonly used 
structures by using the world’s 
largest outdoor shake table to 
simulate earthquakes. The series of 
tests, which began on Jan. 10, will 
measure the effects of earthquakes 
on three-story reinforced masonry 
structures, which are frequently 
used in apartment and hotel 
buildings. 

The tests are being conducted 
at UCSD’s Englekirk Structural 
Engineering Center in Scripps 
Ranch. The shake table is a 
realistic simulation of earthquake 
conditions and will be instrumental 
in contributing to available data. 
It will also influence methods of 
analyzing structures, according 
to Benson Shing, the structural 
engineering professor leading the 
project. 

The structure   — made out of 
cinder blocks to fit California’s 
seismic standards — was tested 
on the shake table. The structures 
undergoing tests were designed in 
accordance to the requirements for 
buildings, which have changed over 
the years to minimize chances of 
collapse during earthquakes. 

Shing said the tests have not yet 
concluded, but results so far are 
promising. 

The tests simulate earthquakes 
modeled after the 1994 Northridge 
earthquake — which measured a 6.7 

on the Richter magnitude scale — 
but will also simulate earthquakes 
up to 7.0 magnitude. This is the 
first time that current building 
structures, as well the structures 
present during the Northridge 
earthquake, have been tested under 
conditions of such extreme stress 
or on such a large-scale shake table. 

The data will be incorporated 
into a larger database that is used to 
enhance the accuracy and precision 
of prediction tools and can be 
used to accurately simulate the 

performance of 
structures with 
similar designs 
but unique 
details.

“ T h e 
s t r u c t u r e 
performed very 
well,” Shing said. 
No significant 
damage has 
affected the 
s t r u c t u r e s 

as a result of the shake-table 
simulations. Although little of the 
resulting data has been announced, 
the testing website includes 11 live-
action cameras currently streaming 
from the site of the shake table.  

Due to the many lives that have 
been lost to earthquakes, engineers 
are attempting to make sure 
buildings are safer than the ones 
that have collapsed previously. Of 
special concern are the structures 
that serve the general public, such 
as hotels, schools, apartments and 
hospitals. 

The project is funded by 
a $1.5-million grant from the 
National Institute of Standards and 
Technology through the American 
Recovery and Reinvestment Act 
program. The National Science 

Foundation is funding this 
testing through the Network for 
Earthquake Engineering Simulation 
(NEES) Program in light of recent 
concerns about the safety of such 
buildings. 

Shing and his team are 
collaborating with earthquake 
engineers from the University of 
Texas at Austin and Washington 
State University as part of a 
national movement to help improve 
the safety of common building 
structures.

Part two of the project will 
begin at UCSD in early 2012, when 
Shing and his team will conduct 
comparable tests on a similar kind 
of building, a two-story, masonry 
structure with smaller windows. 

These structures are more 
difficult to analyze, because current 
methods used by engineers do 
not reliably assess the effects of 
earthquakes. The lack of a standard 
prototype also makes analysis more 
difficult. Using the shake table on 
this structure can give engineers a 
more accurate idea of how it will 
respond to earthquakes.

In his fourth violation, Taylor 
asked UCSD’s Independent Review 
Committee to approve $16,821 
from NuVasive on Sept. 29, 2009 
to do research on degenerative disc 
disease patients, but failed to report 
the funding to the FPPC. 

On the forms, Taylor stated that 

he had no economic interest in the 
non-governmental funding source. 

In each case, however, the funds 
from NuVasive either served as an 
investment interest or a source of 
income for Taylor during the 12

Cases Unreported By UCSD Surgeon Were For Income

Since 2001, Only 315 Parking Spaces Were Added
that has no S spots —148 spaces 
were taken away from a total of 228 
spots (that previously included 157 A 
spaces). In the lot, 146 A spaces were 
taken away and only six visitor-pay-
and-display spots added. 

To even out the distribution, 140 
B spaces in Gilman Parking Structure 
and P604 (on the corner of Osler 
Lane and Gilman Drive, near the 
School of Medicine) will also be 
taken away.

To replace those lost B spaces, 
98 S spots in P406 (located in Sixth 
College, on the south side of Pepper 
Canyon apartments) and 35 S spots 
in P102 (located in Revelle College 
by La Jolla Playhouse) were converted 
to B spots.

Graham said they may change 
spaces in P401 (located in Sixth 
College, on the north side of Pepper 
Canyon apartments) to B at some 
point in the future. 

Graham said the allocation of 
parking spots gives precedence to 
A spaces, followed by B and then 
S spaces in terms of proximity to a 
building or area.

“We’re at the bottom of the 
food chain,” Platt said. “That order 
needs to be re-evaluated because the 
undergraduate students make up a 
majority of the campus.”

Platt said this does not mean 
creating more parking spaces, lots or 

structures, but instead for A and B 
spots to be reallocated to S spots.

With a total of 14,138 parking 
spaces on campus, there are 4,910 S 

spots, 1,858 A 
spots, 4,145 B 
spots and 1,084 
visitor spaces as 
of Jan. 1.

T h e 
a p p r o v e d 
re-a l locat ion 
of spaces was 
proposed by the 
Transportation 
P o l i c y 
C o m m i t t e e , 
which is an 
advisory board 
made up of 
students and 
administrators.

The idea 
was proposed 
to TPC 
on Dec. 6. 
Transportation 
Services  then 

implemented the space changes after 
surveys, feedback from stakeholders 
and allocation procedure, Graham 
said. 

The UC system does not receive 
state funding for parking.

According to Graham, there 
are currently an estimated 28,550 
students, compared to 19,681 in 2001. 

Each day in 2010, 53,000 people 
commuted to campus, as opposed 
to 38,000 in 2001. Last year, about 
32,000 vehicles commute to campus, 
with 44 percent traveling in single-
occupancy vehicles. 

“Overall, the numbers of single-
occupancy vehicle trips to the 
campus have been falling due to a 
variety of alternative transportation 
solutions that reduce traffic and 
lower the carbon footprint of the 
campus,” Graham said. 

In 2001, there were 11,132 campus 
parking spaces. Nine years later, only 
315 parking spaces were added.

“Greater usage of public 
transportation and other alternative 
transportation by students, faculty 
and staff reduces the need to build 
additional parking structures on 
campus,” Graham said. 

Pratt said there is a better way 
to set up the transportation and 
commuter system for UCSD.

“A lot of buses don’t run late at 
night and we’re college students,” Platt 
said. “We need to be here late at night 
and we need to get transportation late 
at night and transportation doesn’t 
allow for that. That’s why people get 
and need cars, it’s because public 
transportation in San Diego is not 
that great.”

“We want to do a similar analysis, 
this time just looking at heart attacks 
because what causes strokes and 
heart attacks are very similar. So 
if we find the same trait showing 
that in the general population, heart 
attack rates are going down, but in 
the HIV population, they’re going 
up, this will lend further support to 

what we’ve found [about] strokes,”

If these findings are reinforced,

medications should take extra 
measures to maintain a healthy

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN www.UCSDGUARDIAN.oRG/oPINIoNTHURSDAY, JANUARY 27, 2011

When the UC Board of Regents met on campus last week, 
in between discussing holistic 
admissions and UCSD’s fiftieth 
anniversary, they made two big 
announcements, one day apart. 

One, UC President Mark G. 
Yudof said that next year, the 
UC system will face a $1-bil-
lion budget gap and will insti-
tute layoffs, course reductions 
and enrollment cuts of 20,000 
to 30,000 over the next decade. 
Two, the board decided to dole 
out more than $4 million in 
incentive pay and raises to their 
very own executives. 

Now, amidst protests over 
accessibility and the diminish-
ing relevance of the University 
of California, is not the time 
for our highest-ranking 
employees to be getting raises.

So, how are these raises 
being funded? About $1.2 mil-
lion, or 30 percent, is coming 
straight from taxpayer revenue, 
while the other 70 percent is 
coming from areas like medi-
cal center income and parking 
tickets. (So now, with our cam-
pus’s recent $15 hike in park-
ing ticket costs, take pride in 
knowing that a portion of the 
revenue is helping to bloat a 
top-paid executive’s salary.)

The regents’ argument isn’t 

new: Despite the budget crisis, 
the UC system has to remain 
competitive in the educational 
job market. If the university 
were to lower salaries, the best 
and brightest applicants would 
start looking at other, better-
paying prospects. 

If the $4 million were going 
to keeping and recruiting 
qualified professors and faculty 
members, this board might be 
more supportive. But when the 
$4 million is primarily going 
toward raises for administra-
tors like UC Berkeley’s new 
vice chancellor for administra-
tion and finance, and others 
who have negligible visible 
impact on the quality of our 
education, the raises are dif-
ficult to justify. It won’t matter 
if we have the best administra-
tive talent on top if there aren’t 
qualified students and profes-
sors below them.

The purpose of the UC sys-
tem is to provide as many qual-
ified students as possible with 
the highest possible quality 
of education. It is the regents’ 
duty to uphold and continu-
ously work toward this end. 
Offering raises of as much as 
$41,000 per year to over 1,500 
UCSF employees and univer-
sity executives for reaching a 
performance target represents 

EDiTORiAL

It’s official: I’m now an initiated member of my sorority.After initiation night, my dad 
called to ask how I felt. “Is it supposed 
to feel different?” I asked. He said it’s 
natural to feel underwhelmed by it all. 

It’s like when you turned 18 and real-
ized you could buy cigarettes and lotto 
tickets, but other than that, nothing 
had changed. 

Leading up to the initiation, my 
pledge class met to reflect. We had 
a chance to talk about how we were 
feeling, and each girl spoke about 
her admiration for her sisters and 
the bond that she felt. When my turn 
came, I said: “I feel like many of you 
don’t really know me…but I’m excited 
to show you.” 

I was the only girl to mention such 
feelings of anonymity, but it wasn’t 
meant as a complaint. I realized that 
if they didn’t know me by now, it was 
my responsibility to show them. 

I was warned that initiation 
would be a unique experience. All 
I knew was to show up wearing all 
white. I talked with my pledge sisters 
beforehand and we reveled in the pos-
sibilities: Maybe we would be pelted 
with paintballs, or drenched until our 
clothes were transparent, or maybe 
they knew the mystery would be psy-
chological torture and they wanted to 
watch us squirm. (In hindsight, I don’t 
know why we had such awful expecta-
tions. It’s not like they ever took our 
lunch money.) 

In the end, it was none of the 
above. The initiation ceremony is a 
strict ritual that’s carried out exactly 
the same way for every chapter, both 
past and present. I could meet any girl 
from my sorority, from any school, 
and share the same experience. (Sorry 
 — can’t spill here. Sister’s honor.)

I can say, though, that the 
exchange of secrets brought me closer 
to my sisters.  Every sorority and fra-
ternity, of course, has secrets. When 
you learn what they are, you’re taught 
how to prove you’re one of them — 
and without that knowledge, you 
aren’t really a sister.

The secrets also come with rules. 
They’re never to be spoken around 
non-members and most are never to 
be written down, only to be shared 
Beowulf-style. Just out of curiosity, 
I tried to Google some of my soror-
ity’s secrets after initiation. It made 
me proud to see that not one of my 
235,000 living sisters had leaked them 
to the web.

It’s not that the secrets are ground-
breaking (I didn’t learn if there is life 
on Mars or the key to happiness). 
But they symbolize trust and unity. 
Sororities use initiation to make their 
members feel that they are part of 
something exclusive, something that 
is proof that they are wanted, trusted, 
and appreciated.

So I guess maybe I do feel differ-
ent. Initiation was beautiful and for-
mal, like a church wedding. It allowed 
me to join the ranks of an exclusive 
league of women, bonded by a com-
mon experience.

I also feel pretty cool, sort of like 
I’m a part of a Fight Club. Because 
whenever anyone asks about ini-
tiation, there’s only one thing to say: 
“Sorry, it’s a secret.”

It’s More 
Than a 
Secret

oPINIoN THURSDAY, JANUARY 27, 2011 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 5 

Dear Editor,
I think I’m not alone when I say 

that it’s hard to find a strong sense of 
school pride here. I was shocked to 
discover in my freshman year how 
frequently people described UCSD 
as their fourth, fifth or lower school 
— an education endured rather than 
won. 

In my high school neighborhood, 
college is seen as not just a forma-
tive experience, but the forma-
tive experience. In one’s college 
years, the thinking goes that a person 
finishes his or her maturation into 
personhood; your alma mater truly 
becomes a mother of your soul. 

It was disappointing to find that 
students regarded UCSD as a degree 
factory with temporary housing and 
an overpriced meal plan rather than 
as a beloved home of internal growth.

I was a checkbox and a signature 
away from transferring to Tufts in my 
sophomore year, but for a variety of 
reasons, I chose to stay. I also decided 
to tackle the disillusionment with our 
education that existed among student 
by founding Out of Office Hours. 

The group is fairly simple; we sit 
around a classroom and banter on 
meaningful topics for an hour. It’s 
similar to those fabled, existential 
conversations one is supposed to 
have at 3 a.m. with roommates, but 
it’s informed by students from a wide 
variety of majors and, occasionally, 
professors.

Over its year-and-a-half lifes-
pan, OOH has collected a regular 

membership, a surprising number of 
which praise the group for provid-
ing that deeper substance they had 
longed for in their college experience. 
The weekly conversations always walk 
the fine and deliciously entertain-
ing line between inane musing and 
intellectual debate. The group almost 
never reaches a consensus on ques-
tions, but members walk away with 
strengthened convictions, inspiring 
questions or general food for thought. 

The school does admirably well 
with publicizing what famous alumni 
with banners and school colors 
(the Ask Jeeves guy?! I remember 
those commercials!). Yet, student 
pride must ultimately originate from 
the students, and in many cases, pride 
comes from the sense that one’s col-
lege experience is much more than 
drudgery. 

I appreciate that OOH was able 
to renew an enthusiasm for UCSD in 
myself and many of the other mem-
bers. I encourage anyone interested 
to visit our website (http://www.ooh.
ucsd.edu), or join the conversation

When you know it’s going to 
take your absolute best 
performance to make the 
grade, you can give your brain 
a boost with Study Buddy™, 
an ingenious supplement now 
available at two convenience 
stores on the UCSD campus.

Study Buddy™ is brainpower 
in a package created 

specifically for university 
students.

“Study Buddy was developed 
with natural ingredients that 
help students perform better,” 
says Tyler Johansen, company 
founder. “Campus life and 
curriculum demands 
occasionally collide, but 
professors rarely are 

sympathetic about these 
‘scheduling conflicts.’ Study 
Buddy is the answer. It helps 
improve mental performance.”

According to Company 
literature, Study Buddy™ was 
designed to:

Improve Focus
Improve Memory
Improve Mental Clarity
Improve Mental Stamina 
Improve Recollection

Johansen believes students are 
faced with so many academic, 
economic and social pressures 
that staying sharp and focused 
all the time is difficult. 

“Study Buddy is a safe, 
effective supplement that helps 
improve memory, 
concentration and focus.”

Study Buddy™ is available 
next to the cash register at 
Sunshine Market and Perks 
Café.

an even further shift away from 
prioritizing student 
needs. 

While $4 mil-
lion is, in the end, 
a meager sum in 
light of the univer-
sity’s $20-billion 
deficit, to offer a 
small group of our 
highest-paid execu-
tives raises in the 
name of “preemptive 
salary retention” is to symbolically 
de-prioritize both student needs as 
well as the needs of other impor-

tant — but sometimes less noticed 
— employees.

According to 
Lakesha Harrison, 
president of the 
American Federation 
of State, County and 
Municipal Employees 
(a union that repre-
sents UC employees 
that make less than 
$40,000 a year), even 
a three- to four-per-
cent salary increase 
wouldn’t mean much 

for low-income employees in light 
of a large increase in health care 

costs and a requirement that they 
fund pensions will be taken out of 
their paycheck. 

UC employees like custodians 
and groundskeepers are being 
slammed with higher costs that 
outweigh benefits, while the chief 
financial officer of the hospital sys-
tem at UCLA are receiving a raises 
from $380,000 to $420,000 a year.

In any case, the message follow-
ing last week’s announcement of the 
raises is clear: The regents are more 
concerned with appeasing their 
administrative staff than ensuring 
quality, accessible undergraduate 
education.

Religious Dogmas Dominate in Archetypical 
Exorcism Flick. By Natalie Bui

‘The Rite’ 
Gone Wrong

Despite its array of distorted joints, twisted limbs 
and devilish screeches, “The Rite” concerns itself 
more with faith than the typical blood and guts of 
the genre. “What did you expect?  Spinning of the 
heads?”  Father Lucas (Anthony Hopkins) says. 
(Actually, yes.) 

American Michael Kovak (lifeless newcomer 
Colin O’Donoghue), travels to Italy to study under 

Father Lucas as a ticket out of his dead-end small town. Kovak and 
Lucas are sent to help a pregnant, possessed Italian 16-year-old girl 
that was raped by her father. The two attempt to perform an exor-
cism — but Kovak doesn’t believe in the devil. He just thinks the chick 
needs a shrink.

“The Rite” is loosely based on the real-life experiences of Father 
Thomas, who was brought on set to help portray the exorcism scenes 
as accurately as possible. 

It’s the eternal power play revisited — science vs. faith.  And 
instead of providing a convincing answer worth the almost two hours 
it takes to watch, director Mikael Hafstrom chooses instead to dwell in 
art-school cinematography (saturated flash-backs and hallucinations,

A GOLDEN 
VOICE

David Seidler’s Latest Screenplay Is Snatching 
up the Year’s Top Honors After a Long Wait.
By Neda Salamat • Associate Hiatus Editor

D
irector David Seidler waited 25 years to pen 
his dream project, a story about a burgeon-
ing monarch who suffered from a debilitating 
stutter. Following Tuesday’s Oscar nomina-
tion announcements, “The King’s Speech” 
emerged as an early frontrunner, leading the 

pack with 12 nods overall, one of which is for Seidler’s criti-
cally acclaimed screenplay.  After spending most of his time 
writing kiddie narratives about royalty (“The King and I,” 
“Quest for Camelot”), Seidler’s hand in a live-action drama 
was unexpected.  But according to the UK native, “The 
King’s Speech” was conceptualized far before the release of 
“Quest for Camelot” or “The King and I.”

“When I originally wanted to write it in 1980, I contacted 
the queen mother because I had discovered a son of Logue’s 
(Geoffery Rush’s character) and he said he would cooperate 
and show me all his notebooks from when he was treating 
the king, but I had to get the queen’s permission,” Seidler 
said. “When I wrote to her, she said ‘Please Mr. Seidler, not 

INTERVIEW

[IN CASE YOU MISSED IT] THE KING’S SPEECH
England’s monarchy is in turmoil. In the face of World War II, the elderly King George 
V is on his deathbed, and his philandering son Edward (Guy Pearce) is set to unwillingly 
take the throne.  The King’s frustrated younger son Bertie (Colin Firth) suffers from a 
seemingly incurable stutter, developed after years of childhood neglect and bereavement. 
After numerous failed attempts at eradicating the speech impediment, Elizabeth (Helena 
Bonham Carter) tracks down the quick-witted and good-humored speech therapist Lionel 

Logue (Geoffery Rush).  As the duo work to rid Bertie of his handicap, it becomes clear 
that Edward has no intention of taking his responsibilities as a king seriously, and he soon 
opts to abdicate the position in favor of Bertie. With his coronation speech approaching, 
Bertie and Lionel spend hours working to polish the king-to-be’s drawl. Relationships and 
royal duties come to an explosive head in director Tom Hooper and writer David Seidler’s 
intricate biographical film of a man who finds the courage to speak on behalf of a nation.

in my lifetime. The memory of those events are 
still too painful.’”

So the project was benched.
 “I had to wait 25 years,” Seidler said.  “I 

didn’t think I would have to wait 25 years, I 
thought ‘She’s 80 — I’ll wait a couple of years.’ 
She died at 100 — almost 102.”

It was worth the wait. When “The King’s 
Speech” finally came together, the 74-year-old 
was thrilled with all the A-listers signed on to 
the film. 

“Working with them was like dying and 
going to heaven for a writer, because seldom 
do you get such a fine cast,” he said. “Colin 
[Firth] is quite amazing. I think it’s very unfair 
that someone can be that intelligent, that char-
ismatic, that talented, that good-looking and 
that nice too.  He really is truly a quintessential 
great guy.  And Geoffrey is non-stop energy — 
the two of them worked together beautifully.”

Seidler had always imagined Rush as Lionel, 
but hadn’t expected Firth to take on Bertie.  
The screenwriter was pleasantly surprised with 
how well he fit the role.

“He probed very deeply as to what it felt 
like to be a stutterer,” Seidler said. (The screen-

writer suffered from a stutter from ages three 
to 16.) “What it actually physically felt like, 
what the muscles felt like. The bones lock up, 
that sinking feeling in your stomach. He really 
wanted to know viscerally 
what it was all about. And 
emotionally what it was all 
about — the sense of isola-
tion, the sense of frustration, 
the sense of not being able to 
have a voice to make yourself 
heard. And he absorbed all of 
this. After days he had that 
stutter down — it was incred-
ible.”

As for Bertie’s wife, Seidler 
developed admiration for the 
film’s leading lady, Helena 
Bonham Carter.

“Helena is…I’m totally in 
love with her,” Seidler said. “I 
told her to tell Tim Burton [Carter’s husband] 
to watch his back. She’s wonderfully mischie-
vous.”

Though Seidler made no sacrifices in terms 
of the cast, the script bled on the cutting room 
floor. Two aspects of Seidler’s original screen-
play were cut from “The King’s Speech” during 

pre-production, a time when major changes 
can occur to a film’s script, at the discretion of 
the director and producers.

“Originally Cosmo Lang and Winston 
Churchill were almost a comic 
Greek chorus,” Seidler said. “Some 
funny lines, I mean really funny 
lines. And Tom [Hooper, the film’s 
director] felt, and in retrospect I feel 
that he was absolutely correct, that it 
was too theatrical. It was wonderful 
for a stage play, but for a film, it felt 
a little mattered and stagey. And he 
didn’t want any of that, so that all 
got taken out. Really, some of my 
best lines — gone, gone, gone.”

The second change was more 
controversial. Seidler had originally 
penned King George’s death to mir-
ror how it plays out in the history 
books. 

“The euthanasia of King George V, you 
realize he was euthanized — they finished him 
off because they wanted the news to go out 
to the respectable BBC and London Times,” 
Seidler said. “They didn’t want the news 
to be told by the less disciplined afternoon 
papers. But he wasn’t dying on time, so they 

euthanized him; they actually euthanized him 
with an injection of morphine and codeine. I 
thought that was, first off, very powerful and 
dramatic. And more important than that, I 
thought it said something very meaningful 
about the topic; in other words, it showed the 
power of the new media and therefore what 
Bertie was up against.”

Instead, filmmakers agreed to gloss over the 
messy details.

“Ultimately, Tom and the producers 
decided — we filmed it — but it didn’t make 
the final cut,” Seidler said. “They felt it was so 
controversial that it would start such a contro-
versy, it would overpower discussions of the 
film itself. And so that was the reason for that.”

Even though “The King’s Speech” is still 
making its rounds at awards shows, Seidler has 
already begun work on a new project.

“Next for me is a project called ‘The Lady 
Who Went too Far,’” Seidler said.  “It’s about 
Lady Hester Stanhope, who in the Napoleonic 
wars, went off into the Middle East and 
became a Lawrence of Arabia  — sort of a 
Laura of Arabia. Exactly what Lawrence did, 
only 100 years before him.“

We can only hope it earns him as much 
Oscar gold as his current biopic. 

Last year, a few former members of Minnesota

alarmingly pleasurable fi rst album as Free

A fter 30 years of pro-ducing genre-defining post-punk from 
R.E.M. to the Red Hot Chili 
Peppers, you’d expect Gang 
of Four’s latest album to 
reflect some semblance of 
that effortlessly aggressive 
New Wave flare. But on 
Content, the iconic band 
abandons its guitar-heavy, 
politically driven sound for 
baffling, avant-garde mini-
malism.

Whereas their most suc-
cessful singles were in the 
vein of less rage-infused Sex 
Pistols (“Damaged Goods” 
off debut Entertainment!), 
or a rhythmic cacophony 
of experimental feedback 
(“Tattoo” from last studio 
album Shrinkwrapped), 
Content stretches a handful 
of repetitive tracks into an 
album of obvious punk. 

On “You’ll Never Pay 
for the Farm,” singer Jon 
King drawls, “You’ll never 
pay for the farm/Someone 
should raise the alarm/I 
think you’re losing your 
charm/You cannot do any 
harm.” The beaten-to-death 
rhyme scheme, along with 
King’s limited vocal range 
(he strains to reach high 
notes at his tender age 
of 55), might make you 
wonder whether the same 

track’s been played on 
repeat for the past half an 
hour. 

The only gleam of hope 
comes when guitarist Andy 
Gill is able to escape King’s 
lifeless drone on the pro-
phetically titled “It Was 
Never Gonna Turn Out Too 
Good,” a dark and melodi-
ous jam that’s beautiful in 
its simplicity. He releases a 
slow, simple riff that hums 
with rich reverb and glim-
mering moments of feed-
back, but fails to save the 
track from its curious con-
clusion: a dialogue between 
a Stephen Hawking-style 
synthesizer and King’s 
vocally impaired subcon-
scious on poverty and the 
tragedy of his life. 

Gang of Four hold a 
place of relevance and 
esteem from punk’s fin-
est era, but there’s none 
of that here. The intensity 
and originality of the group 
has drained away in the 
decades since their incep-
tion, as more recent artists 
have taken their once-inno-
vative style and run with 
it (Pixies, Interpol, Death 
From Above 1979…), leav-
ing us with an album of 
poorly recycled sounds.

10 spouts the catchphrase of the decade: “Everybody dance now!” The cafeteria members obey, rising from the bench-

es to fist-pump and twirl their way through the number. 
As far as ’90s nostalgia goes, nothing beats that song. 

I memorized the “Superstar” dance number when I was a 
kid, so you better believe I was more than familiar with the 
C+C and the Music Factory hit — not to mention the fact 
that it was used in dozens of commercials, films and televi-
sion shows. Most importantly, “Gonna Make You Sweat 
(Everybody Dance Now)” was included on the one and 
only Jock Jams, Volume 1. 

Most of us were too young to remember the initial 
release (’95) of the ESPN-produced compilation — created 
to pump up athletes of all kinds — but the following four 
editions (released in ’96, ’97, ’98 and ’99) had a definite 
generational impact. 

Yet now, Jock Jams holds a peculiar place in musical 
history; not yet old enough to achieve its recognition as a 
classic, not new enough to still be relevant, the compilation 
stands in pop limbo. 

If it were up to me, Jams would get the recognition it 
deserves, joining the ranks of Nirvana and Backstreet Boys 
in our recollection of a not-so-distant decade. 

Take “Gonna Make You Sweat.” When the track was 
released in 1990, it sparked the house movement that 
enabled Jock Jams. Its combination of lazy, Ice-T raps with 
throwback R&B vocals and revolutionary electronica was 
nothing short of groundbreaking for a time when ‘80s 
power metal wasn’t yet a thing of the distant past. 

But as the decade moved on, the track was culturally 
recycled so many times that it began to lose its luster. It 
has now become the go-to choice for musical sequences 
like the one in “Superstar.” (If you’re looking for impromp-
tu choreography in your movie, make someone say, 
“Everybody dance now!” It’ll damn well begin.)

But don’t blame C+C; the tunes on Jock Jams are unde-
niably fun. They expertly combine pump-it-up cheerleader 
chants, classic hip-hop (Biggie, BLACKstreet, Naughty 
By Nature) and goofy early house music (Quad City DJs, 
Technotronic). I’d dance around aimlessly in my room as 
I blasted the CDs on my boombox. In fact, I still do the 
same now, except swap the childhood boombox for my 
iHome. 

I miss that boombox. With Jock Jams and the Spice 
Girls at the ready, we had some pretty good times. Now 
that I’ve re-downloaded and stored that album on my iPod, 
though, I can start the party anytime. Just add Sunny-D 
(and this time around, maybe some off-brand vodka).

shots of craftily placed rosary beads). 
Michael Petroni’s script does Hafstrom no favors. Trading in 

frights for personal dilemmas, “The Rite” depends upon a nuanced 
character study; each priests’ motivations, however, become mud-
dled as the movie progresses. Why Kovak even wants to join the 
superstitious seminary is a mystery to all involved — including the 
young man himself. 

Despite philosophical missteps, the darker scenes use horror 
standbys to occasional success. The noises in the background — 
eerie organs, sort of like what you’d hear after communion — build 
to a “Jaws”-like crescendo, making the most insubstantial scenes 
appear menacing (a cat leaping from a window inspires a yelp or 
two). But “The Rite” has no follow-through, choosing to make 
nothing from the narrative’s inherent suspense. 

Even the demons are duds. The shots of possessed victims 
inspire laughter, not fear — their bodies twist into decrepit expres-
sions of pain, with clownishly dilated pupils and humorously 
wrinkled faces. 

With a premise that relies on the devil’s shock value, the flick 
would have been more successful even if it stuck to Hollywood hor-
ror archetypes. Instead, “The Rite” tries to impart a dull sermon. 
Better to take a catnap in the pews.

T he New Pornographers are an easy band to like. The Vancouver 
band’s best album, 2005’s 
Twin Cinema, is chock-full 
of catchy melodies, lik-
able, power-pop aesthetics 
and just enough charm to 
separate it from alt-rock 
radio fodder. But on each 
New Pornographers record, 
there’s always a hint of 
eccentricity beneath the 
surface. That glimmer of 
weirdness is Dan Bejar. 
When not playing with the 
New Pornographers, Bejar 
composes complex, liter-
ate pop music under solo 
moniker Destroyer.

Bejar’s records, such 
as his 2008 opus Rubies, 
tend to sound like a drunk 
professor crooning over 
groovy, Bowie-style electric 
rock. While “drunk profes-
sor” part of the equation is 
still firmly intact, Kaputt 
finds Bejar collaborating 
with several Vancouver-
area electronic artists to 
produce music that falls 
somewhere between den-
tist’s office soft rock and the 
ambience of Aphex Twin. 
The setup sounds sketchy 
in print, but the results are 
oddly captivating. 

On “Bay of Pigs,” a pre-

release single and definite 
standout, Bejar spends two 
minutes crafting a gor-
geous, minimalist sound-
scape before the vocals even 
begin. When he does come 
in, he does so in classic 
Destroyer style. “Listen,” he 
beckons, “I’ve been drink-
ing.” He goes on to declare: 
“The world is black stones 
dressed up in the rain.” 
The song meanders for 
another eight minutes, with 
Bejar dropping similarly 
nebulous observations amid 
stark disco synthesizers.

Another standout is 
the dance floor-worthy 
title track, on which Bejar 
describes a man “chasing 
some girls, all right, chasing 
cocaine into the backrooms 
of the world” while funk-
lite bass and smooth per-
cussion hazily roll through 
the background. 

His lyrics are vague 
— equally deserving of 
dismissal or unpacking 
upon each listen — and 
his sounds are bizarre, but 
with Kaputt, Destroyer still 
keeps you interested, craft-
ing one of the best records 
of Bejar’s career.

O n his 2007 record The Shepherd’s Dog, Sam Beam — under 
moniker Iron & Wine — 
swapped his pared-down 
folk sound for a full band, 
adding brooding percussion 
and a variety of globe-trot-
ting influences. The result 
was not only interesting, 
but also surprisingly radio-
friendly (Beam made it on 
the “Twilight” soundtrack 
for a reason).

Four years later, even 
Kristen Stewart would be 
shocked to hear the pomp-
ous style Beam has cham-
pioned on follow-up album 
Kiss Each Other Clean. 

Beam’s once quiet, whis-
pery vocals have abandoned 
all restraint, and his acous-
tic sound is drowned out 
by cascading jazz horns. In 
small doses — as evidenced 
on The Shepherd’s Dog — it’s 
an effective experiment. But 
at such a constant extreme, 
Beam’s loose assemblage 
of noises and instruments 
sounds more puzzled than 
put-together. 

On “Rabbit Will Run,” 
for example, Neil Young-
esque electric guitar riffs are 
layered on top of peculiar 
hoots and Caribbean drums. 
Beam is trying out the 

musical experiments of ‘70s 
folk artists like Cat Stevens, 
to schizophrenic effect. 

The effort is admirable 
and the experiments that 
do work are a step in the 
right direction. The psy-
chedelic finale “Your Fake 
Name Is Good Enough For 
Me” tries out a Pink Floyd-
style sound that could have 
worked well for the rest 
of the album. It’s like an 
old-school jam band break-
down — swirling from horn 
crescendos to an escalating 
sing-a-long, before clatter-
ing to a climactic end. But 
when the experiment goes 
badly — with such an over-
whelming assemblage of 
global instruments and folk 
standbys — less really might 
have been more

When Bob Dylan first 
plugged in his electric guitar 
at the Newport Folk Festival 
in 1963, he took his folk 
roots and acoustic harmo-
nies to new heights. Maybe 
Beam wants to do the same 
here, but the album is more 
a disorienting scramble 
than a musical revolution, 
though a few moments of 
brilliance slip their way in 
along the way.

C ritics love to praise bands by saying they have “their own sound,” 
but few have earned the des-
ignation to the extent of San 
Francisco avant-rock power-
house Deerhoof. The animal 
drumming of founder Greg 
Saunier offsets singer Satomi 
Matsuzaki’s cute-but-deadly 
vocals, as the band navigates 
a fusion of psychedelia, ‘70s 
funk and electronica.

Ten stunning albums in, 
Deerhoof extend their spec-
tacularly diverse career with 
Deerhoof Vs. Evil. Absent 
is the dry, improvisational 
whimsy of The Runners 
Four. Deerhoof have opted 
for a tamer, more deliberate 
approach, and the product is 
all-too-often disappointing.

The most obvious 
departure from the group’s 
past work is the album’s 
meticulous production. The 
alien percussion and syn-
thetic bleeps on opener “Qui 
Dorm, Només Somia” rise to 
a focused, mid-tempo jam 
that regrettably avoids the 
band’s signature chaos. Even 
Matsuzaki sounds unfa-
miliar, her typical squeaky 
imperfections drowned out 
by an overdubbed chorus.

But much of Deerhoof 
Vs. Evil simply feels tired. 

“Behold a Marvel in the 
Darkness” opens with a 
pleasant, acoustic guitar-
driven verse that drags along 
painfully, interrupted by an 
occasional surge of noise. 
The jangling stomp of “Hey 
I Can” loses its charm half-
way into a driving climax 
of cuckoo clock sounds and 
monosyllabic chirping.

Occasionally, Evil’s focus 
on songwriting pays off. 
Single “Super Duper Rescue 
Heads!” provides a catchy 
pop refrain over exuberant 
percussion and synthesizer. 
“Secret Mobilization” cap-
tures some of the band’s 
hard-hitting, guitar-jam 
gold, just before the album 
descends into its madden-
ingly lousy conclusion. 

You have to hand it to 
Deerhoof — 13 years into 
one of indie rock’s most 
erratic discographies, they’ve 
made their most unexpected 
move to date: a flat, forget-
table album. And although 
Deerhoof Vs. Evil dwells 
heavily in murky misfires, it 
does offer enough moments 
of explorative sparkle to 
keep us awaiting the band’s 
next release in head-scratch-
ing anticipation.

respect.

of 1812. Since then, no enemy army has set foot in our 
territory, and we came out on top in each of the World 
Wars. Thus, historically, the U.S. has always found the 
best competition within its own borders. 

In Europe, however, soccer unites and divides; it’s 
where your entire country comes to compete, and 
every little nuance in the game is ingrained in its citi-
zens from a young age, because that’s how it’s always 
been. It has “always” been that way because the best 
competition for European and South American coun-
tries has always been amongst themselves and against 
other countries in the world. 

Young players grow up hoping to represent their 
nation in the World Cup. They do not simply hope to 
make it to the big leagues, or to the NFL or NBA. They 
want to be part of a team that goes into every match 
with national pride on the line. They want to prove 

they are from the best country in the world, and they 
are willing to take on anyone to prove it. Thus, the 
countries find self-worth on the soccer pitch, not on 
the baseball field or basketball court.

In America, this aspect of international competi-
tion might not be feasible, as fans cannot just go to 
Europe, the Middle East or Asia to watch a game.  But 
the MLS is becoming more and more popular and it 
is possible that it may one day rival the other major 
American sports. 

However, with the near-dismal performance of the 
U.S. team in the World Cup, the U.S. still has a long 
way to go before soccer becomes a mainstream sport. 
Such a shift would be a cultural and societal shift away 
from baseball and basketball, meaning that it’s a slow 
time frame for success for the sport. (Unless, of course, 
the sports gods want to really shake things up, and we 
manage to win the World Cup.) 

But the Tritons came out and 
dominated the third set, taking an 
early three-point lead and not look-
ing back. UCSD easily won the set 
at 25-16. 

“I felt like once we got to game 
three, we really got going,” Ring said. 

Senior setter Phil Bannan col-
lected 29 assists on the night, and 
needs just 112 more to pass Brooks 
Dierdorff ’s 3,867 career assists and 
become UCSD’s all-time leader.

“Phil Bannan, at that point, 
showed he’s our MVP,” Ring said. 
“He got it down from the service 
line, did a great job at the net 
blocking, and made our passing 
look a little bit better than they 
really were. He was able to handle 
a lot of really tight passes — passes 
off the net that he did a nice job 
with.”

On the match, the Tritons hit at 
a season-high .333 clip. 

Sophomore outside hitter Carl 
Eberts said the win was an impor-
tant one, as the Tritons snapped 
their losing streak.

“We were able to get in sync, we 
were a little off on the weekend so 
it was good to get back into it and 
get a flow before we face Hawaii on 
Friday,” Eberts said. “I think serv-
ing was a big difference; we served 
and passed a lot better and from 
there everything flowed off of that.”

Eberts recorded his first career 
double-double, with 14 kills and 12 
assists, both team-highs.

The Tritons will face No. 11 
Hawaii at RIMAC Arena this 
Friday, Jan. 28 at 7 p.m. 

“[We have to] serve and pass, 
just play our game. If we play on 
our side well, I think we’ll do well,” 
Eberts said.

two victories the Tritons had on the day, winning the 
100 breast stroke (1:07.27) and the 200 breast stroke 
(2:25.43).

“With the meet being so close, we were looking for 
people to step up, and they did,” McGihon said.

This season, many athletes have been shifting races 
and competing in different events, experimenting with 
what works and who performs well. The team is trying 
to find its best performers in each event in order for 
more to players to qualify for conference and national 
championships.

“We went into the meet looking to give people some 
opportunity to swim some new events,” McGihon said. 
“One of our team’s abilities is their depth. We can put 
anyone into a race and they’ll perform well.”

On the men’s side, junior Matt Herman won the 
longest races of the day, the 1000- and 500-yard free-
style races, with times of 9:44.94 and 4:41.53, respec-

tively. Junior Blake Langland won the 50 freestyle 
(21.13) for the second straight meet and swam a per-
sonal best during the final leg of the men’s 400 relay at 
the end of the day. 

Despite the results, McGihon said the team would 
not peak until later this season. 

 “The majority of our team will be focusing on 
conference championships for the next three weeks, 
and trying to get their times,” McGihon said. “But the 
people who have already qualified for national champi-
onships will work on a different training regimen, wait-
ing to peak until later.”

The Tritons will have their final home meet this 
weekend. The men’s team will take on Hawaii and 
Wyoming on Friday, Jan. 28 at noon, and the women’s 
team will face Hawaii, Wyoming and San Diego State 
on Saturday, Jan. 29 at noon.

Soccer, as much as I hate 
admitting it, is more popular than 
American football, baseball or 

basketball. This is not true in the 
U.S. But more Americans watched 
the World Cup last year than ever 
before, and Major League Soccer 
sneakily averages better average 
attendance figures than the NBA 
(size of the arena is definitely an 
issue there). 

But in terms of per capita view-
ers and participants, the U.S. lags 
behind other countries. 

It’s not that soccer is boring 
— far from it. Just the other day, 
Didier Drogba of Chelsea FC hit a 
goal against Everton that had more 
movement than Hoyt Willhelm’s 
wicked knuckleball (Willhelm, 
of course, being the Hall of Fame 
pitcher widely known as the best 
knuckleballer ever to play baseball). 
Even those that find the sport dull 
can get into a game if they see a 
goal or two, a slick pass here or 
there and a “Did you see that?!” 
moment during a few minutes of 
play. It’s not because of the lack of 
excitement that the game hasn’t 
caught on. Rather, as Americans, we 
were not raised on it, and we do not 
breathe it as a national conscious-
ness.

From a young age, our society 
has taught us that baseball is the 
“American” game and football is 
where the toughest, coolest guys go 
to prove their manliness. Basketball 
is like football without pads. You 
bang around and can show your 
skill and strength on the court 
against your friends. 

But it’s hard to prove your 
manliness in America on the soc-
cer pitch. There’s just something 
about flitting around, kicking a ball 
that doesn’t seem manly or tough. 
It’s just something that has been 
engrained in our young, brutish 
American heads. 

For other countries, however, 
baseball is not their pastime — soc-
cer is. Soccer is the test of skill and 
strength rather than football or 
baseball. 

In short, this is because 
Americans have a superiority com-
plex. The most-watched games here 
are football and basketball. We don’t 
want to know if other countries 
could beat us, as we honestly don’t 
think that they could, and the possi-
bility that they might is threatening. 

The NBA Finals are totally with-
in the U.S. (excluding the Toronto 
Raptors, but when have they ever 
been good?). The Super Bowl is also 
exclusively American. At the risk 
of sounding redundant, the World 
Series is really the North American 
Series, as only U.S. and Canadian 
teams can play. Nevertheless, the 
winners of all these games claim to 
be “world champions.” Americans 
do not care to see other interna-
tional competition as legitimate due 
to this very superiority complex, 
which, I think, is just a product of 
social ignorance.

TRITONS END SKID 
AGAINST  PRINCETON

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL

By Hanna Rahimi • Staff writer
Photo By Nolan Thomas

The UCSD men’s volleyball ended its three-game skid on Wednesday night, beating Princeton 3-0 with set scores of 25-21, 25-23 and 25-16. The 
Tritons have now won 11 consecutive matches against 
the Tigers, with their last loss coming in 1997.

The Tritons took an early lead by winning the first 
set. UCSD thoroughly out-hit the Tigers .345 to .148, 
but the set was still tight with seven tie scores and 
three lead changes. 

“We did get off to a good start, but we let them back 
in it a little,” head coach Kevin Ring said. “I think we 
let them stay around. We let the score be closer than 
it should have been and I felt like we didn’t play our 
best by any means tonight. I wanted to — not necessar-
ily run away with it — but just be the better team and 
play like it, and we didn’t do a great job of that in game 

one.”
Game two proved to be even closer, with .267 hit-

ting from the Tritons and .241 from the Tigers. UCSD 
kept the lead until Princeton went ahead late in the set 
at 20-19. But after trading points, the Tritons were able 
to pull through and take the set at 25-23.

“They [the Tigers] are coming out and it’s a good 
trip for them to get their season going, so they’re play-
ing really loose,” Ring said. “I felt like we’re just tight 
and we weren’t executing, bottom line. We had too 
many service errors, we weren’t passing that well, and 
they just swung away and played fearlessly. When you 
play fearlessly, you’re going to play loose and usually do 
pretty well.”

Final Relay Powers UCSD Over Cal Baptist

JohN haNacek/Guardian File
The Tritons won 15 events against Cal Baptist — nine for the men and six for the women — to take 
the meet on both the men’s and women’s side.

By Tyler Nelson
Associate Sports Editor

SWIMMING & DIVING — It took 
a last-second relay, but the UCSD 
women’s swim team scored a come-
from-behind victory over Cal Baptist 
University this past weekend. The 
Triton women pulled out a win in 
their last heat to take the meet by a 
score of 152-146, while the Triton 
men also defeated Cal Baptist in a 
close competition, winning 163-137.

“It was a close meet, closer than we 
expected,” head coach Scott McGihon 
said. “They were more ready to go fast 
than we were in terms of our training 
cycle, but we needed to be tested and 
we needed to battle through this.”

Going into the final race — the 
400-yard freestyle relay — the wom-
en’s teams from the two schools were 
separated by just seven points, with 
Cal Baptist in the lead. Relays have 
traditionally been a point of strength 

for Triton swim teams, and this sea-
son has proven no exception.

With their two captains, junior 
Alex Henley and senior Anju 
Shimura, leading off in the race and 
sophomore Amber Tan and freshman 
Anji Shakya following, the Tritons 
finished in 3:34.34, winning by a com-
fortable seven-second margin over the 
Lancers.

“We put up our best team out 
there on the relay and we beat them,”
