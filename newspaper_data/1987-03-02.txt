UNIVERSIN OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO MONDAY, MARCH 2, 1987" VOLUME 58, #37 

By CHARLES TABESH, Contributing Sports Editor 

Sayers. Lombardi. Butkis. Kazmierowicz. Stienberger. Wait a minute. 
Kazmierowicz? Steinberger? 
When one thinks of Canton , 

home of the NFL Hall of Fame, 
. names of the football immortals 
come to mind . You may ask, 
then , who are these two 
unknowns? What's the 
connection? 

Well , maybe they're not 
destined to become quite as 
famous as the others, but close. 
They're twO of the twenty-nine 
Tritons who will be striving for 
their own slice of immortality in 
the Ohio ci ty, as they will 
compete in the CM diviSIon III 
swimming final later thIs month. 

Under the supervIsion of 
Coa h Bill Morgan, the UC D 
swim team has become the 
second ranked diviSIOn III team 
in the country for both men and 
women. And , although it will be 
quite tough , they have their best 
chance ever of winning a 
championship. 

For one, an impressive 

number of Tritons have qualified 
to represent UCSD in the finals . 
The NCAA sets a time each year 
for every event, a time which 
must be beat in order to swim in 
the tide meet. While competing 
again~t other teams, individuals 
are trying to better this coveted 
time so they may advance. The 
greater number of swimmers that 
qualify for the championships 
from one school, the stronger the 
school's team becomes. 

"The whole basis of the season 
is to get people qualified ," 
Morgan said. And UCSD will be 
sendi ng the maximum allowable 
number of men , eighteen, along 
with eleven women to the title 
meet. In contrast,the avemge 
division 1Il school will end a 
total of three or four swimmers. 

Also , the Triton team is much 
improved over last year, and last 
year's team fimshed third in the 
nation. "There's a pecial 
enthusiasm on thi team 
compared to the past," said Bill 
Kazmierowicz, la t year' star 
who will wim the 200 yard

freestyle , 200 back troke , and 
200 individual medley in the 
finals . 'This is the strongest 
season we've had for the four 
years I've been herc." 

Really, the Tritons face JUSt 
one obstacle in their 
championship drive. But it's a 
huge one -- Kenyon college. 
Kenyon is the perennially 
doiminant team in division III 
swimming. TheIr men and 
women are currently at the top 
of the NCAA rankings, and they 
are not overrated . They won 
their first championsh ip in 1938 
and have n't lct up, finishing fir t 
for the past even years. 

Morgan i realistic about hI 
team' chance . "To overcome 
Kenyon would be quite a feat ," 
he admitted . But he also 
maIntains orne Opttmlsm, 
especially with regard to thc 
men. "The men are withtn 
striking distance." 

And Kazmierowicz, without 
being negative, is also cognizant 
of the situation. "We have an 
opponunity to be competiti ve 

. 

with Kenyon this year. I look . has brought fine hIgh school all-
foreward to the challenge. We're Americans to the school , as a 
closer than we 've ever been ." winning tradition is being 

So, with their last "regular" developed . "We're on track for a 
season meet bihind them, all national championship ," Morgan 
that's left for the qualifying believes. 
swimmers is to rest. The 
women's championship will be 
held from the twelfth to the 
founeenth of March and the 
men's wil1 be held a week later. 

Overcoming the Kenyon 
dyna ty promises to be tough , 
not only this year, but in the 
year to come. UC D, however, 
has been 'teadily climbing the 
ladder of improvement, and it 
appears their ri e is ac elerattng. 

Of thc twenty-nine qualifymg 
SWImmers, only two will be 
graduating thl - year --
Ka mierowl z and Dave Higdon . 
"Thi ne t year or two are gOIng 
to be bIg year for us ," Morgan 
saId . "We're going to be 
tremendou Iy strong." 

Also, aSIde from the return of 
the experienced swimmer , 
UC D has had it be t 
recruitment year ever. Morgan 

Recruitment is cenainly aided 
when (he team does well: 'The 
kids want to know that there's a 
good combination of athletic 
and academics," said Morgan, 
explaining why UCSD is able to 
get some quality swimmers away 
from division I schools. 

And WIth the strength of the 
Tnton hedule each year, the 
recruits know they'll be facing 
orne tough compeutlon. "It's a 

predomtnantly dlvl Ion I 
schedule ," Morgan remarked . 
Thl eason U D beat divi Ion 
I powerhouses U C and Indiana. 

Apparently, SWImming has 
found a pIa e at UC D, and n-
futurc looks bright. It may never 
be ablc to produce football Hall 
of Fa.mer , but perhap another 
Mark pltZ or Tm y Caulkins will 
cmergc . ~

in the faU of next year. Within 
the following four years 
enrollment will climb to around 
3.000 undergraduates. The 
college will be housed on the 
former site of Warren College in 
an area now referred to as the 
Matthews Academic and 
Administrative Complex. 

Lyon , who eamed his Ph .D. at 
Harvard an 1963, IS a former 
chairman of the UCSD literature 
department. He Joined the 
faculty in 1974 after servi ng as 
an assistant professor at Harvard 
and an associa te professor at the 
Universi ty of Florida. While at 
UCSD. Lyon served as assoCiate 
dean of graduate students in 
1977-78 and as chairman of the 
literature department from 1978 
to 1982. 

He has received fellowships 
and grants from the Harvard 
University Canaday Humat}ities 
Fund, the National Endowment 
for the Humanities. the American 
Council of Learned Societies. 
and the Guggenheim 
Foundation. 

Lyon's areas of interest include 
German Iyri POCtry, prose and 
drama from 1900 to the present. 
German hterature since 1945. 
and relationships between 
German, French and Amencan 
literature. 

He is an aurhority of the life 
and works of the playwright 
Bertolt Brecht. In 1980. Lyon 
published a book, "Benoit Brecht 
in Amenca." wh ich discussed the 
famed dramatist's life in the 
United States from 1941 -47

Researchers glow 
over firefly gene 
By PEllR MESSROBIAN, Se llior raJ[ Wnter 

A research team at UCSD has successfully implanted the firefly gene that causes that insect to glow into cultured monkey cells. 
Previously inserted into tobacco plarlts oy the same UC D 

researchers, the gene allows scientists to literally see what is going 
on inside a particular cell without killing the cell . 

Jeffrey R. de Wet and Keith V, Wood are the graduate students 
who helped carry out the research on the versatile gene. and three 
senior members of the research team include Dr. Donald R. 
Helinski, director of UCSD's Center for Molecular Genetics. Dr. 
Suresh Subramani . a molecular biologist. and biochemist Marlene 
Deluca. 

The glow of a firefly is caused by the combination ofluciferin , the 
enzyme substrate, and luciferase, the enzyme itself. which is 
produced by the luciferase gene. This is the gene that was 
combined with the monkey cells' DNA in such a mannerrhatwhen 
luciferin is added. all the ceUs emit enough light to be detected by 
photosenSitive instruments. 

In the future , the luciferase gene will be attached to specific parts 
of the DNA. and in order to glow, the part of the DNA to which the 
gene is attached must be active. or engaged in whatever that part of 
the DNA was designed to do. In this way researchers can tell exactly 
what a ceU, or tissue - which is comprised of identical cells - is 
doing at any particular time simply by seeing if it is lit. 

When used in this way. a gene is known as a reponer gene. 
Previous reporter genes used radioactive substrates. such as 
carbon- l4. which necessitated killing the cells or breaking them 
open in order to detect the genes. According to Subramani. the 
principal investigator formis study, "one reporter gene is as good as 
any other reponer gene, and the extra features this [fireflyl gene 
offers are that you can detect glowing cells without killing them, and 
you can isolate a glowing cell and do interesting things" that you 
could not normally do if it was dead. 

One example of an "interesting thing" is analyzing cell lineages. 
or tracing the division of a single cell containing the firefly gene as it 
fonTIS a tissue. "You can actually see what happens to it once it 
divides and what happens to the daughter cells and succeeding 
generations of cells " Subramani said. 

In addition , DNA, with the reporter gene already implanted , may 
be removed from the cell and modified . then placed back into the 
cell where any changes may be seen by checking for the telltale glow 
of the luciferase gene. This is known as gene therapy, and 
inheritable diseases such as diabetes may someday be cured by the 
alteration of the faulty human genes involved . CUlTently, the 
researchers are working on what 5ubramani termed the "pilot 
experiment." which involves "getting the DNA into cells, and 
expressed and regulated properly in the right tissue ." This 
procedure will be the same for all cells, so the result of this 
experiment will be a brand new tool for genetic research . 

In order to carry out gene therapy, one must know exactly how 
the reporter gene is structured so that the consequences of placi ng

UCSD research team just

and Subramani said that now 
"investigators can further

purposes. Without the sequence

Impossible to manipulate the 

The animal must then be 
killed in order to add the 
luciferin and discover which 
cells are activited . 

"This sort of experimentation 
is a necessity," said Dr. 
Subramani, because "there are a 
10( of interactions taking place In 
an animal system - hormones, 
cellular interactions, and the 
immune system - that are not 
present in cell cultures." The cells 
themselves will temain alive even 
though they have been removed 
from their native organism. 

Besides not having to kill the 
cell being studied, there are 
other major improvements .over 
the reporter gene (called O\T -
chloramphenicol acetyl 
transferase) which is now 
commonly in use. Subramani 
noted. "This gene is 100 to 1.000 
times more sensitive than the 
present reporter gene being used , 
50 times cheaper, and a whole 
lot faster." 

Nevertheless, the technique is 
still in its infancy, and while 
great things are expected. as 
evidenced by the more than 200 
laboratories which have asked 
UCSD for the gene, much work 
remains to be done. ~

Column in a box 

Amidst the glitz 
Covering the Grammys put a lot of things in perspective for me. 

Watching the program in the media area backstage via televlsion 
mOl1ltors while interacting with other press people and "the stars" 
was probably 360 degrecs different than what was seen by viewers 
at home. 

Yes, I was amidst thc glitz and the glamour. but I was also behind 
the scenes. The press area which was comprised of curtained 
corrals sectioning off members of the press according to a person's 
field of the media; televison , radio, daily press/ photos and the 
general prcss/ photo area , wherc the ass~iate arts editor and I were 
stationed . waS comfortable , yet chilly. 

On our television monitors we watched an unedited version of 
the show which was simultaneou!;ly shown live and spliced with 
commercials on the east coast, and was pre-recorded for the west 
coast. We missed the premiere of Michael J. Fox's and Michael 
Jackson's' new Pepsi commercials. but I have a fcehng I'll sec them 
more than enough times whenever I wat h the rube from now on . 

I ho. l'e a taped version of what viewe rs at home saw. I haven't had 
the time or the desire to wat h it yet, but eventually I Will, and I'm 
sure I'll enjoy it all the more bccause I did !xIve the chance to be 
behind thc seenes, 

The live action of thp winners and presenters who came down 
for tntervlews and photographs. of course, foregrounded the 
unadulterated version of the show; but the camaraderie was there 
amongst the press as we crowded the 19-inch set dunng the 
"important" awards, u h a "Album of the Year." 

Many of my views of the mass media world were reinforced while 
others were disillusioned. Since I was not of the media elite I was 
expecting to be positioned far from the entertainers, and I w~~. But 
instead of bemg stuck in the back the six hours I was there, my new 
friends, George and Danny, who had photographed the Grammys 
for years, gave me hints and Virtually made me move closer to the 
"action ." 

No, not all journalists are "dog eat dog," but OaJlny then told me 
about how a few years ago in the photo area alohe there were 350 
people. He said. "Photographers were jockeying for a good spot, 
and one woman was slapped aD the way across the noor by a man 
because she was in his way of a shoe" 

Driving up to the Shrine, I was telling my co-editor that one of the 
reasons (and probably the most important one to me) I am wary of 
making a career in journalism is that many involved in med ia have 
no qualms about pushing and shoving and kicking and sc reaming 
their way to the tOp. not cari ng who is hurt in the process. 

We weren't with the "big leaguers" so maybe the Grammys did 
not exemplify "real journalists" at work. Most of the people I met 
were nice , 'and I'm sure Meg (from Loyola-Marymount's paper) and 
Jeff (from the Daily Bruin) appreciated this graciousness as mucQas 
I did . But the potential to prostitute journalistic ethics is always 
there - who knows what the three of us will be like in five years?

meeting allegedly responstble for 
thc ratification of thc newly r 
modiflcd meters. Prelimll1ary 
informal inquiries of membcrs of 
thc committee showed no such 
proposals werc ever madc at that 
or any prior meeting. These 
minutes of that meeting were 
also tOtally devoid of any such 
notation. Six committec members I 
were then fonnally interviewed 
and substantiated the charge that 
the "quarter only" proposal was 
never submitted for approval.. 
Then how did UCSD get stuck 
with thesc outrageously 
inconvement and potentially 
hazardous devices? The Vice 
Chancellor of Business Affairs 
and the Manager of Parking and 
Transportation presumably 
signed for the "quarter only" 
devices in an attempt to allegedly 
savc the Un iversity $ 15 ,000 
dollars a year in lost revenues 
from unlawful perpetrators using 
"bogus coinage." 

The proponents of the 
initia ti ve and me AdviSOry 
Committee feel that the opinions 
of the campus community (as 
well as visitors from off-campus 
who have complained about the 
quarter only meters) are being 
ignored , and that the role of the 
AdviSOry Committee is being 
seriously undermined. Vice

Sampling the UC Regents 

Anderson, attorney 

UC Regent heldon Anderson , a 
Los Angde :momcy and banker, 
hold . the dlstln [Ion of being 
the fI rst gay member o f the 
Board of Regents. FIfty-five years 
old, Anderson I the chairman of 
the board of the Bank of Los 
Angeles, and the head of a Los 
Angeles law firm that bears hIS 
name The Cali fornla enate . 
which must approve all 
appointed Regents, gave 
Anderson exac tly the 21 votes he 
needed to become a Regen t. 
According to an a rti cle In the 
L.A TlnIes by Janet Clayton , 
"Controversy surrounding 
Anderson was muted because 
there was no open floor debate 
on hIS appointment," but It was 
obvious that Anderson 's 
homosexuality affected the 
outcome of the vote . One of the 
more hberal board members, 
Anderson IS on the board of 
directors of the Gay and Lesbian 
Community ervices Center and 
the ACLU Foundation, among 
other organiza tions, and IS .1 
member of the Lawyers for 
Human Rights and the Califo mla 
POSt Secondary Education 
CommiSSIOn, and IS active In the 
Democratic Party. 
W. Glenn Campbell stands out 
as one of the most conservative 
members of the Regents, He has 
a Ph.D. In economics from 
Harvard Unive rSity, and has 
been dIrector of the controversial 
and conserva tive Hoover 
Institution on War, Revolution 

and Peace at tanford UniversIty 
or the pa. t t\\'enty-slx years He 

was born In Ca nada In 1924, 
became a n.1turahzeu U .. clttzcn 
In 1953, and after receIving hIS 
doctorate at age 24 Llught at 
Harl'Clru for thrce vcars . Since 
then he has \\'ork~d hIS \Va }' up 
In national conservative CIrcle s. 
becoming ChaIrman of the 
President's Intelligence Overslghl 
BOJrd In 19tH , and a member of 
many other PreSidential 

Campbell. doctor of economics 

Commmccs and Task Forces, 
mcludlng one on education . 
Since 1976, he has belonged to 
the Board of Directors of the 
Committee on the Present 
Danger, a far right wing anti· 
Communisl organiza tio n. 

However, in a 1983 interview 
wi th the editors of the San DIego 
Umun , Campbell saId that while 
hc supponed a fee mcrease, he 
fel t the dIffere nt fees should be 
levied on dlffcrent level students 
(I.e . lower dIVISIon , upper 
dIviSIOn , and graduate students 
would pay di[erent fees , with 
graduate and professional 
students paying the most), and 
that more university resources 
should be funneled towards 
UCSD 

The present halrman IS Fran k 
W. Clark , Jr. , a lawyer who was 
appoimed by Jerry Brown in

Hatvard Law choo!. Smith is 
Ronald Reagan's personal lawyer, 
and was appointed to the Board 
by Reagan in 1968, He is a 
director of Pacific Telesis Group 
(Pacific Bell) and RCA, among 
other companies, and has been a 
trustee, director or member of 
many schools, museums, and 
organizations. He served as 
Chairman of the Board of 
Regents in 1970-72, 1974, and 
1976, and during two of those 
yea rs served as vice cha innan of 
the California delegation to the 
Republican National Conve ntion . 
Smith was reappointed in 1986 
and may stay on the Board until 
1998, at which time he would be 
up for reappointmmt. 

Only twO Regents in the 118 

Smith, la"2!r 
year history of the Board have 
been residents of San Diego, and 
one of them , Frank L. Hope, Jr., 
was appointed in March of 1984 
Hope is chairman of the board 
of Hope Consulting Group, an 
international architectural firm 
that has done work in Saudi 
Arabia , England , and the 
Philippines. He is also director 
of Security Pacific Corporation. 
In an interview with Gary Shaw 
of the San . Tra 

shortly after he was sworn In , 
Hope described his ties with the 
univer ity and what he hoped to 
accomplish as a Regent. "My wife 
a nd I went to school at UC 
Berkele y, two daughters 
graduated fro m UC Santa 
Barbara and my son is curre ntly 
arrending Berkeley," Hope said . 
While he had no specific goals 
at the time , Hope wished to 
"make sure whatever resources 
the university has are employed 
to the maximum extent." Since 
Hope was appointed to replace a 
resigning Regent, he has only 
four years until he is up for 
renomination . 

One of the more liberal 
members of the board is Yvonne 
Brathwaite Burke, an attorney 
who has broken a lot of ground 
in county, state , and national 
politics. Her biography shee t 
sta tes that she was the first 
woman and the first black ever 
to serve on the Los Angeles 
County Board of Supervisors. In 
addition , she was the first black 
woman to be elected to the U.S. 
House of Repre sentativ.:s from 
the state of California. She also 
served in the California 
Assembly, and helped enact laws 

accord to her bio sheet, 

"greatly benefited Califomia's 
indigent c hildren, health 
insurance consumers, residents 
of homes for the elderly and 
orphaned and victims of 
govemmental urban renewal and 
expansion projects." She 
presided over the 1972 
Democratic Convention, and 
remains very active in the 
Democratic Party. Burke is Vice-
Chairman of the Board of 
Regents, and her term extends 
until 1993. ~

Tritons pound Coyotes 
By BRIAN now, Staff Wnlfr 

I light of the promollons the Truon Waves have been staging lately 10 
bring fans to TrilOn Pavillion , it's 
100 bad mey didn't give away 
free pillows before aturday 
night's volleybaU match between 
the UCSD Tritons and the CSU 
San Bernardino Coyotes. 

Only the most ardent volleyball 
fan was able to stay awake 
through this match which the 
Tri tons thoroughly domi nated en 
route to a three game sweep of 
thetr outmatched opponent. After 
struggling through a sloppy first 
game, whICh they won 16-14, 
UCSD gamed momenrum and 
rolled through me final twO 
games. 15-10 and 17-15. 

The Triton intenSity level was 
high consldenng the 
sluggishness of the match. They 
played hard, aggressive volleyball 
and controlled evcry aspeCt of 
the game. Led by John Lim's 
blockmg and offe nse and Mar 

Genrzbourger's selling, UC D 
allowed the Coyotes few chances 
to even conSider wmning a 
game. 

The Coyotes ( 1-3) were 
planning a Side- trip to Tijuana 
after the game , but after watching 
the contest it seemed more like 
they were planning a Side-trip to 
Triton Pavillion rather than 
Tijuana. Either way, they were 
not prepared for the game. Their 
passing was bad and their 
defense was weak. Thus, they 
were unable to generate any 
semblance of an offense and 
werc at the mercy of the Triton 
splkers. 

One reason for the resounding 
Triton Victory is the difference in 
their programs. Everyone who 
thinks UC D has its troubles as 
a DiviSIOn III school playi ng 
Men's Open Division volleybll 
hould wke a look at the CSU 

San BernardinO program. The 
Coyotes a rc a club team and 

have no budget to speak of. In 
Other words. they must raise 
mo ney to even be able to play in 
a match . How can they compete 
when they must struggle just to 
sUlViv('? 

UC D head coach "Digger" 
Gr.tybill believes they can hold 
their own with many of the 
Intercollegiate Volleyball teams 
and is more man \villing to play 
them. "We hope they can elevate 
their program 10 the 
Intercollegia te level , allowing us 
to fonn another league to play 
in ," sa id GraybilL 

NOt only mat, but the victory 
ove r CSU an Bernardino (12-
11 ) marks the fi r5t time UCSD 
has risen above .500 this season . 
And , perhaps It gives them a 
litlie momentum for their 
upcoming mat hes with Navy 
Fnday night. and San Diego 
State on Saturday. ~ 

Rugby clubs Claremont 
By JOSHUA WElL 

AT the beginning of this yea r's 'season , the UCSD rugby team set their 
sights on noming shon of a 
league champIOnship. Following 
Saturday'S 61-10 demolition of 
Claremont-McKeena the Tritons 
are 4-0 in league and well on 
meir way to a league 
championship. 

Will UCSD continue to cake -
walk mrough me rest of me 
league? "I don't think so," Coach 
Tom Buder said . "We now set 
into the haTd pan of our 
schedule. We play IrvIne , 
Pomona, and Loyola, who have 
each been league champions for 
seven straight years. ThiS will be 
a good test for our team as well 
as our coaching expertise." 

Still , Butler was encouraged by 
Saturday'S outcome. Following a 
less man stellar game against 

OCCidental , when the team barely 
managed to squeak out a victory, 
UCSD was looking to run up the 
score against Claremont. For the 
fIrst few minutes, however, the 
Tritons looked disjointed and 
confused as play moved wildly 
about the field . 

The game's first points were 
scored when UCSD winger John 
Tellenbach broke mrough a 
defensive line and outran 
everybody for a SO-yard try and 
4 points. Triton fly-half Dan 
Schleifer followed wim another 
try a few minutes later when he 
faked a pass and left his 
defender stari ng at his footprints. 
But Tellenbach missed bOlh 
conversions and the TritOns led 
8-0 . When Claremont scored 
and conve rted . it was suddenly 
8-6 and UCSD appeared to be on 
their way to a second consecutive 
abysmal performance. 

Schleifer got me team in gear, 
however, when he connected on 
a 25 ya rd three-point drop kick 
just as he was being hit. From 
then on it was all UCSD as every 
Triton back scored at least once. 

"I gOt some good open play 
and hard running by my backs 
today," Butler said. "I would love 
to have some school support for 
our laS{ three home games. 

UC hvine is our next 
opponent and mere is definitely 
no love lost between the two 
teams, especially between me 
coac hes. Irvine was one of only 
two losses for us last year." 

Rugby's last three home games 
are March 7, agamst UCI, March 
14, against Cal-Poly and March 
21 , against Loyola-Marymount. 
All matches are on Mile-High 
Field . ~ 

Triton John Lim (1 1) and Luke L.au (3) gang up on a CSUSB spiker Friday night. 
UCSD beat the Coyotes in thru games, 16-14, 15-10 and 17-15. 

Ski trophy in sight 
This could very well be me 

year. Wim me men Triton skiers 
in !econd and me women in 
mird overaU, me league trophy 
may soon belong lO UCSD. 

"What's exciting about this 
year is mat we're ahead for me 
third consecUtive year. After 
winning for mree years in a row, 
me perpetual trophy is retired to 
mat winning team," said a 
hopeful Nick Nedd, head coach 
of me UCSQ ski team. 

The Triton skiers compete 
against the likes of UCLA., UCSB, 
UGI, as well as soslJ and Cal 
Fullerton . The slalom and me 
giant slalom are skied in the 
competitions, usuaUy held at 

Mammoth or June Mountains in 
the Sierras. 

This year, skier Andy Nevitt 
nearly made it to the Nationals. 
"Andy was that close," Nedd said. 
Team leaders also include Eric 
Stein and John Knutzen for the 
men and MicheUe Curach and 
Madelyn Schneider for the 
women. 

The upcoming schedule for 
the Triton skiers ·includes races 
on March 14-15 at Goldmine in 
Big Bear and on April 18-19 at 
Mammoth. It will soon be known 
if this is the year to retire that 
trophy.
