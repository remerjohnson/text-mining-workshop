Berkeley Police 
Combat Carjacking 
BERKELEY - Police at UCB 
are trying to deal with what seem 
to be the latest trend in auto theft : 
carja king. Acting on a request 
from the FBI, Berkeley police 
will begin recording the number 
of carjacking reports because of 
the growing frequency with 
which the crimes are occuring. 
In many instance would-be 
carjackers have a minor accident 
with the victim and then force the 
driver out of the car, often at gun 
point. Although there haven ' t 
been many injurie caused by the 
theft 0 far, one Oakland re i-
dent was kidnapped and later 
killed.

Fake Filer Falls To 
Fool Students 
BERKELEY - UCB tudents 
were victims of an elaborate 
practical joke recently, in which 
they received a letter informing 
them that their residence halls 
were contaminated. The letter 
stated that the Lawrence 
Berkeley Laboratory's experi-
mental "zeta-particle decelera-
tor" was causing a power surge 
that affects brain activity. 
According to Lab officials, a 
zeta-particle decelerator doesn't 
exist and they are searching for 
the source of the letter. About 
100 students received the letter, 
most of whom weren't amused.

Co-op Deal May Fall Through 
CRISIS: A.S. changes to 
Memorandum of Understanding 
could lead to legal battle 
By Eric Schmidt 
Senior Staff Writer 

The A sociated Students approved a revised 
Memorandum of Understanding regarding the 
statu of the tudent co-ops on Friday, potentially 
jeapordizing on-going negotiations with the stu-
dent businesses. 

The memorandum, worked out by repre enta-
tive of the co-ops, AS., Graduate Student Asso-
ciation (GSA) and administration before a Jan. 
31 deadline, was ratified by the AS. Council 
after certain portions were modified. 

AS. President Mike Holmes said the AS. 
attempted to work with other partie to modify 
the memorandum, but he received minimal input 
from the GSA, co-ops and administration. 

Groundwork Books Co-op member Chloe 
Burke said the new memorandum significantly 
revises the Jan. 31 agreement. "There are some 
major changes that are substantive and therefore 
unacceptable," she said. 

According to Burke, co-op members were 
prepared to accept technical and language 
changes, but not changes in intent. Burke cited a 

2 

new rule regarding possession of co-op as ets if 
a co-op dissolves a an example of such a 
ubstantive change. 

Previously, he said, dissolving co-ops were 
given ome control over their assets upon clo -
ing. The revision "basically says our assets stay 
on-campus to fund AS. Enterprises," she said. 

Holmes said, however, that the changes 
relating to assets were made so that new co-ops 
would be able to tart up should an old co-op 
close. "We wanted enough capital so that stu-
dents would have [a new co-op] if[ existing] co-
ops took their assets and took off," he said. 

Another revision allows the GSA to end its 
involvement in the co-ops with a three-quarters 
vote, which Burke said discriminates against 
the GSA "We could accept something that 
[applie tq, both counci ls]," she said. 

University Deputy General Counsel Gary 
Morrison, as legal coun el for the administra-
tion, also changed the document somewhat, but 
Holmes did not follow several of the changes, 
according to acting Assistant Vice Chancellor 
of Student Activitie Lynne Peterson. 

Peterson aid co-op negotiations are over. 
"If there 's not a signed agreement, everything 
will be in default. There will be no agreement," 
he said. In that case, a legal battle may ensue. 

Students Discuss Future of SAAC 
By Melissa Jacobs 
Staff Writer 

Students gathered Tuesday evening in 
Galbraith Hall to discuss the futureofthe Student 
Affinnative Action Committee (SAAC) in a 
general quarterly meeting. 

In his opening remarks, SAAC Chair Poncho 
Guevarra described the meeting as "an opportu-
nity for [us] to get a long-term focus as to what we 
can do as a coalition and an organization. Thi is 
where the communication begins." 

The general meetings are supposed to give the 
regularly-scheduled Wednesday SAAC meet-
ings more focused goal for addressing issues 
and working toward changes, he said. 

Under consideration was SAAC's need to 
create an official statement of purpose. Accord-
ing to Guevarra, SAAC members would like to 

revamp and finalize tructural guidelines for the 
organization. 

Last year's SAAC chair and current SAAC 
representative for MEChA Juan Astorga began 
with a general introduction the purpose of the 
committee and its goals at UCSD. 

SAAC discu ses issues ranging from fee hikes 
and budget cuts to issues surrounding the Asso-
ciated Student and the co-ops, with respect to 
underrepresented student groups. 

The committee also works with Student Out-
reach and Recruitment (SOAR) in the recruit-
ment of high school tudents for the university 
and joins with the Student Affirmative Action 
Human Relations Program to design programs 
on sexual and cultural diversity and affirmative 
action, according to Astorga

Lobby State 
Legislators 
BUDGET: Weekend conference 
in Sacramento rallie upport 
against fee hike , budget cuts 
By Dan Krauss 
Senior Staff Writer 

Hundreds of student from the University 
of alifol11ia and the Califol11ia State Univer-
sity (CSU) converged at the state capitol 
Monday in a massive lobbying effort aimed at 
voicing student concerns to state legislators. 

The event marked the first time that the 
University of California tudent Association 
(UCSA) and the California State tudent 
Association (CSSA) have worked in close 
conjunction at the annual conference. 

According to elipe Bolivarofthe UCSA. 
the summit was intended to "tellthe legisla-
turethat we'reconcernedabouthigheredu a-
tion and funding for higher education and that 
we want our voice heard." 

"We're making sure llegislatorsj are in-
formed [about) what bills the tudent sup-
port and what the student ' opinions are," 
said UCSD Associated Students Pre ident 
Mike Holmes. "No one represents students 
better than students." 

The lobbying session was followed by a 
rally on the west steps of the capitol building 
which was attended by hundreds of'students 
from across the state. Among the many speak-
ers at the rally were tate Senators Art Torre 
(D-Los Angeles) and Tom Hayden (D-Los 
Angeles). 

According to Bolivar, Torres emphasized 
the powerofthe polls while Hayden proposed 
that those who threaten to downsize educa-
tion should them elves be downsized. 

According to Holmes, the lobby effort 
focused on several major issues concerning 
students, 010 t notably the state budget. The 
UC Regents are currently planning a $1 ,000 
fee increase along with a five percent cut in 
faculty, staff and adminstrative salaries, in 
order to off-set state budget cuts. 

"The way things are going, we ' re going to 
be priced out of an education," Bolivar said. 

Another important issue, according to 
Holmes, was the statu of financial aid. which 
has seen little or no increase in funding de-
spite skyrocketing fees. 

Holmes said that the students also lobbied 
heavily for regent reform. Currently, the gov-
ernor is responsible for electing the majority 
of the regents. Holmes aid that some tu-
dents are propo ing that a new ystem of 
composition, which could include term lim-
its, be considered. 

"It 's not to deny autonomy," said Holme . 
" It's a question of how the board is com-
prised." 

Holmes aid students al 0 made an effort 
to support a bill known as the Pipeline Project, 
which would expand and diversify the faculty 
and emphasize teaching in math and techni-
cal fields. 

Students who attended the summit said 
they got mixed reactions from the legislators. 
While some were very receptive to tudent 
concerns, others didn ' t take Ihe time to hear 
them out, according to Holme and Bolivar.

GNOTES 
Co-op Agreement- Graduate Student Association (GSA) member Steve 
Dubb expressed his disappointment with the A.S. CounCtl 's decision to sign the 
revised Memorandum of Understanding. He satd he felt "intentionally de-
ceived" by the council and A.S. President Mike Holmes because Holmes signed 
"without negotiations with the co-ops and the GSA: Holmes took issue with 
the accusation, saying the council had devoted considerable t ime and money 
to the memorandum and its "commitment and devotion should be recognized: 

Holmes added that the A.S. attempted to negotiate with the GSA, co-ops and 
administration, but those groups were "reluctantly cooperative: 

Dubb also criticized the manner in which the A.S. would dispose of the co-
ops' inventory assets if they were to close, as outlined in the memorandum. He 
said he was "disturbed at this power play for the co-ops' assets." A.S. 
negotiating committee member Carla Tesak rebutted Dubb's statement, 
saying the objective of the council during negotiations was "not necessarily to 
keep the co-ops, but to keep those student services available: Holmes 
supported Tesak's claim, adding that the co-op inventory assets would be used 
as the startÂ·up cost so that student services could be started again. 

o-raa Election Referendum QuestJon.- After numerous amendments 
and considerable debate, the council agreed to put one of three proposed 
questions conceming the RIMAC facility on the A.S. General Election ballot next 
month. This question will ask students if they would approve the creation of a 
student facilities board to oversee the $70 per student per quarter fee for the 
RIMAC facility. Three other RIMAC-related questions were still under considerÂ· 
ation at press time. Two of the three questions addressed the actions of Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Joseph Watson, and the third was a question 
about the availability of a 24- hour study hall. The questions read, "Do you feel 
that there is a need for a 24-hour study area on this campus?", "Do you have 
confidence that Vice Chancellor Joe Watson is responsive to student needs?" 
and "Do you approve the move by the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs to 
disestablish the University Center Board?"

Announced Visit by Vice President a 'Cruel Hoax' 
Vice Preside-nt AI Gore was not at UCSD yesterday. 

Normally this would not be new , but due to an elabo-
rate prank that announced a noon visit by the vice 
president al\ over campu ,many students expected the 
new number-two to make an appearance. 

Announcements touting yesterday' noon visit by 
Gore showed up on c1as room chalkboards, in fliers 
around campus and in pre relea es to local new papers. 

By late morning ign had gone up in the Price 
Center announcing that the visit was a prank. 

Though there was no truth to the announcements, 
that did not top " hundreds" of people from calling 
student information (EDNA) inquiring about the al-
leged visit. According to Robb Earnest, who wa busy 
answering the calls at the information window at the 
Price Center all moming, the re ponse had "been ri -
diculou ." 

The Guardian received a news release by fax mid-
Wednesday morning, allegedly from the Sail Diego 
Union-Tribune, announcing a" urpri e" visit by Gore 
between noon and 2 p.m. The fax purported that the 
event was sponsored by the ASUCSD and the College 
Democrats. 

Signs like this one were posted In the Price Center 
yesterday wamlng students of the Gore Hoax. 

According to Union-Tribune reponerSteveSchmidt. 
his newspaper also received the release, only it report-
edly came from the Guardian.

shape, ize and flavor would be for sale - not to ment ion the usual 
contingent of mincemeat pies. 

â€¢ A celebrity car wash at the ARCO tation: Everyone loves a car 
wash. At five dollars per car over the course of, say, a three-day 
weekend, the university could tum a nice profit. Add celebrity 
attractions, uch as a Jonas Salk dunk tank or pin-the-tail-on-the-
chancellor, and students would never have to wony about financial 
aid again. 

â€¢ A Casino Nite in the Main Gym: Everyone loves to gamble. 
Black tie ... $500 a head .. . All for the good of the kids. And, if 
nothing else, it' tax deductible. 

â€¢ A sales conte t: Everyone loves sales contests. They encourage 
competition and enterprise and generate a healthy en e of camara-
derie. Student could ell magazine subscripLions or. better still, $1 
candy bars. Of course, the stakes would nece sarily be high. First 
prize could be a top of the line Aiwa stereo ystem. Second prize 
could be a green parking permit. And third prize? Third prize is 
you' re expelled. Now that's incentive. And it certainly would solve 
the problem of overcrowded e1as es. 

All of thi is ab urd, of course - but no less absurd than a IO-k 
run or imilarly dubious ventures. With all due respect to Vice-
Chancellor Wat on, when the university tarts seriously considering 
uch ~nrel iable fund-raising scheme as a viable way of aiding 

finanCially-strapped tudents, omeone i obviously not on the ball. 
In light of the university's present hard times, it must make 

adequate financial aid a top priority. The state of California has 
pledged to make public higher education available to the top 12.5 
percent of it high chool graduates. Higher fees may be inevitable, 
but financial con traints should not necessarily exclude otherwise 
qualified students from a university education. The stale must use 
whatever measures are available to make good on its pledge, and 
spare the university the indignity of reducing itself to the level of a 
common street beggar, urban school district or public television 
station . Running a university is difficult enough as it is. 

11Ie Big Fuss Over at lhird 
Who would have guessed that renaming Third College after the 
I~te Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, a champion of civil 
nghts, would meet any resi tance? But apparently some Third 
students are outraged that campus adrnini trators did not consult 
with them before pursuing the change. 

The e student have a point - Third College wa founded 
through the efforts of students, and for too long tudent input has 
either been rejected or ignored. But the fact remains that renaming 
Third after Marshall is an excellent idea, one mo t tudents eem to 
agree with. Fai ling to get tudent input on the matter doesn' t change 
that fact. 

Contrary to the claims of orne opponent , the Third College 
philosophy will not vani h in a trail of vapors simply because 
Political Science Professor Peter Irons, Third College Provost Cecil 
Lytle and Chancellor Richard Atkin on failed to call up each Third 
tudent and get hi or her opinion on the maner. 

Renaming Third after Marshall should not be rejected simply 
because the admini tration made the decision without asking tu-
dent . This situation hardly ets a precedent that will jeopardize 
student input forever. The renaming process may not have been 
perfect, but the end re ult is nothing to be ashamed of.

Still, I can't deny that "black"/Afro-Caribbean culture

seen a whole new generation of white, Latino and Asian 
kids coming up who move through "black" subcultures

adopted Ziggy's tale about intenaciallov-

I think at the time I saw that line as a son 
of honorific title. I was a songwriter in a 
multiracial band, and no doubt it was an ego 
boost when black people would cosign on 
my participation in "black" culture. In ret-
rospect there may have been an irony in 
Ziggy ' lyricsthatImi sed. There seems to 
be a whiff of "Iungle Fever" tereotyping

had to walk through downtown MoBay . 

Locals looked at Valeria's braids and

SEEING 
THROUGH 
THE SMOKE 
COMMENI'ARY: Keeping 
UCSD 'smoke-free' is a right 
for people who don't smoke and 
an obligation for people who do 
By Damen Scranton 
Associate Opinion Editor 

One of my friends came up to me the other day 
and started complaining about the fact that he 
couldn't buy cigarettes anywhere on campus. He 
had just visited the Sunshine Store in search of a 
pack of Camel Filters and the man at the counter 
had said, "I'm ny, but th is i a sllIoke-free 
campus." That' what employees in the Sunshine 
Store, at least, are instructed to say. 

Yes, putting it that way is a bit of lap in the face 
and no, it doesn't take a genius to see that Califor-
nia, let alone the University of Califomia at San 
Diego, is incredibly down on smoking. But that's 
quite understandable. The people have a pretty 
good case against cigarettes. 

More Americans die each year of illnesses 
linked to cigarette smoking than of any othercause. 
The exact exlent to which ailments such as lung 
cancer and heart disease are related to moking is 
always up for debate, but there are obvious physi-
cal repercussions. And recent srudies have also 
produced undeniable evidence pointing to the 
hazards of second-hand smoke and smoking by 
pregnant women. 

And the overall health costs of cigarette smok-
ing are staggering. According to a Hearing before 
the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, 
Americans spend over $22 billion annually in 
medical bills treating smokers and smoke-related 
illnesses. Including tobacco sales and estimated 
lost production due 10 tobacco-related ailments, 
that number soars to over $82 billion a year in the 
U.S. alone. Once again, it is impossihle to calculate 
ex.actly how much tobacco smoking cosrs our 
country, or the world for that maner, but there are 
obvious economic repercussions, too. 

Using these same arguments over the past 
decade, the state of California has aggressively 
campaigned, both socially and legalJy, to get its 
residents to kick the nicotine habit. Controversial 
taXes on cigarettes have funded controversial ad-
vertisements that target children and anempt to 
SlOp smoking before it begins, and these cam-
paigns have been largely successful. 

Thanks to dozens oflaws passed in the last few 
years, smokers are fmding it more difficult to light 
up in public places such as restaurants, office 
buildings and sporting arenas. Spaces that were 
once polluted by people who aren't considerate 
enough to keep their smoke to themselves are now 
actually inhabitable by those with asthma, emphy-
sema or smoke-related allergies. UCSD smokers 
were upset when the Grove Caffe relegated them 
to a small, somewhat secluded area next to the Old 
Student Center parking 101 earlier this school year. 
But. in my opinion, if your moke can even be 
smelled by someone who doesn't want 10 smell it, 
then you're smoking tooc\ose. They're not sitting 
too c\ose 10 you. You're"SITlOking tooc\ose to them . 

But !here's more to this smoking issue than 
health, economics and common courtesy. It is a 
problem that goesmuch deeper than all of that. One 
of the reasons that UCSD is such a "smoke-free" 
campus is because it is such an upperÂ·dass, white 
school. I don 'twantto make a racial issue out of this 
-I love this school and think that. in general, the 
students here are great The fact is that more lower-
class minorities smoke, in the U.S. and worldwide, 
because the neighbotboods in which they live are 
being bombarded by the tobacco companies' ad-
vertising campaigns.! read once that the number of 
billboard and sidewalk cigarette advertisements in 
Philadelphia's poorer communities was over 400 
percent higher than in its wealthier white residen-
tial areas. 

As a result of much of the newfound infonna-
tion !hat confums the serious health risks of to-
bacco and cigarette smoking, millions of Ameri-

OPINION 5 

COMMENTARY: As last week's kidnapping of an African-American tudent howed, 
campus police are missing in action when it comes to serving the min rity community 

THE CASE OF THE MISSING COPS 

GAYE 

JOHnson 

When you look at 
cases of poli e negli-
gence or discrimination, 
it 'seasyloget idetrncked 
by all the legal jargon -
what constitules this, 
what d n't constitute 
that. Pretty soon it gets to 
the point where you don 't 
know if you were right or 
wrong in the first pIa e. 

But sometimes you 
just have to look at the 
issue for what it is, be-
cause when peopledon 't., 

a situation which really does constitute discrimi-
nation is turned into tegal penn iss ion. 

Well, here ' a prime example, and a very 
I aI one at that: last week, an African-American 
female was kidnapped from campus, driven 
around for approximately eight hours. and even-
tually escaped in Pacific Be.'\ch. 

Aside from the fact that thi was a traumatic 
experience, there was a context set by the even 
leading up to it which could very well suggest 
negligence on the part of the UCSD Police 
Depanmenl Not only had she reported numer-
ous times that there was someone stalking her, 
the police did not advise the Third College 
Residential Life Office to release a community 
bulletin, alening residents to possible danger. 

Their reason for this was that this was a 
"personalized" case; that because an individual 
was being stalked, no one else was in danger. 

oW,l'm not a cop and I'm not a detective, 
but I do know that if one resident is in such grave 
danger, there is potential for danger to others. 
This man was po ing as a solicitor, someone who 
moved freely among the on-campus apartments 
and residence halls. 

Because the offices of Residential Life oper-
ate on an advisory basis with the UCSD police. 
the only bulletins they were advised to release 
were regarding the iUegality of solicitation on 
campus. 

This not on\ydownplayed the victim's fear as 
ilJegitinlate, it kept necessary, precautionary in-

fonnation from the residential community. Alier 
numerous complaints, the only thing the UCSD 
poli e had to offer was a detective whose job was 
basically to collect wrinen infonnation. No field 
detective, no real consolation. 

Getting back ro the legal jargon, the poli e 
can 't really do anything about a stalker unt il he 
physically touche.~ the victim. But that's nOl 
where the discrepancy lies: releasing a descrip-
tion of the perpetr,llor w discouraged by the 
police, according to the Third College Resident 
Dean. In fact, in the end, it was the decision of the 
Resident Dean to put out a community alert the 
night of the kidnapping, describing the perpetra-
tor and providing residents with safety tips. Not 
Ihe police, the Resident Dean. 

Most can recaU the rape of the woman on 
Gilman Drive: a Caucasian woman was raped by 
an African-American male. There was more 
infonnation released and publicized about the 
crime of an African-American male in an off-
camplls incident than there was about u white 
male perpetrator on can1pus. 

Again, the police claim this recent inc idem is 
a personalized crime, and therefore does not 
warrant the releaseofinfonnationsince there was 
no real danger to other residents. But if you read 
over many past police repons, there are some as 
vague as a " 'uspicious character" fining the 
description: "African-American male with brief-
case." 

We can easily accept the explanat.ion of the 
UCSD Police Department. But let me juxtapose 
this situation with another recenl one invol ving 
an African-American male. 

Last week, an African-Amerielm Third stu-
dent was walking to his car when he saw a 

parking officer writing our a ticket. He told the 
officer he was about to leave, but the officer 
decided to give him the ticket anyway. When the 
individual anempted to Ie.we, the officer blocked 
the way, scratching his car. The tudent got out of 
the car. and the officer proceeded to block the 
doorway so he couldn't re-enter the car. When 
the student brushed past him to get in. the parldng 
officer called for police backUp: sit police C:U'!; 

~howed up. they handcuffed him and took him to 
jail. Sixcan.? You tell me. 

So here we have it: two questionable inci-
dents which, if looked at for what they are, have 
some seriOliS implications about the meial cli-
mate of UCSD' Police Department as a whole. 

1n my opinion, the handling of the kidnapping 
case was under-prioritized at be!,t, and mcist at 
worst. I think thepolicedepmtment did what they 
had to do to say they had done everything they 
could have done. It was simply a poorly handled 
case. And the question becomes. "why?" 

Look at the police repons of white female 
victims of similar crimes and you ' IJ see a consis-
tent Ihoroughnes..~ absent in th ill elISe. Yet you've 
never seen a more thorough report when the 
perpetrator is 'll l African-American. 

You tell me what I'm supposed to do with a 
description like "African-American with brief-
case." I'IJ be suspecting the (few) black profes-
sors on campus; I'll be looking at evely profes-
sional African-American asa potent ial crimmal. 
lfthal is how I look at it,ldon'teven wanttoguess 
at the secret suspicions of many whites on this 
campus. 

The incident with the African-American and 
the six police cars speaks for itself - I hope. It 
does not take six cars to secure an unam1ed man 
who hl'llshes past a parking officer. Intimidation 
tactics, while often effective. are a tack)' substi-
tute for fair thinking. Especially in an institute 
known for boasting its intelligence. 

At thi point, no one wants to say for sure 
whether or not the irresponsible handling of these 
incidents has rdCial undertones. Looking at the 
big picture. taking into account other crimes, 
other v ictims, and descriptions of \Yhite perpetra-

Editor: 

In your SIOry about Jerry Brown's visit on 
March I ("Gov. Brown Pushes Campaign 
Refonn." March 4), you completely failed to 
mention that he was brought here by the 
College Democrats. Club members worked 
very hard to make the event possible, and the 
event was a tremendous success. packing the 
Price Center Theuter so much that people had 
to stand in the back. Their work shou Id not be

As a student newspaper, the Gllardian 
should be sympathetic and supportive of stu-
dent activi m. 

It was especially ungenerous and in bad 
taste to leave out mention of the College 
Democrats as we were the ones who set up the 
interview with Ihe Glfardian. 

Hosting Jerry Brown is part of our larger 
program to inform the student body that the 
only real solulion to the university' fee in-
crease and other problems is a political olu-
tion - in particular, we need a new governor. 

Former Governor Jerry Brown's support 
of students, both in his comments and by 
coming here (Republicans ignore students) 
contrasts greatly with Govemor Pete "Scrooge"

objectivity is impaired by supporting student 
organizations, be as ured that nothing is lost 
by accuracy. 

It is a great di appointment to have to bring

What About cafe Diana? 
Editor: 

Because you have chosen to ignore an 
important new phenomenon on campus (in 
favor of other priorities, such as harass ing and 
misrepresenting the Women's Resource Cen-
ter), you have left the task up to studenls to 
spread the word about the new student-run 
coffeehouse on campus. Fortunately, thi hasn 't 
been too difficult. because word-of-mouth has 
traveled fast about Cafe Diana at Ihe CM Cafe. 

First of all, Cafe Diana fill s a need. Before 
il exislence, there was no comfortable (Ihey 
have couches!), creative, tudent-run (as op-
posed to corporate or administrative) environ-
ment for tudying, gathering and communing 
on campu (not to mention ,my place open past 

I 1:30 p.m.)! 
Cafe Diana is also special because of what 

it represents, which is the realization of stu-
dent dreams. A handful of hardworking slu-
dent were dedicated and imaginative enough 
to make this happen, and they have created an 
environment which is truly one of the wann-
est, friendliest, most creative, comfortable and 
hllmall places on campus. Furthermore. any-
one can get involved, work there and provide 
their creative input. 

Finally, Cafe Diana is a student-run coop-
erative business which has achieved great 
success in a short period of time with little 
publicity and no administrative support, testi-
mony to the creative possibilities for student 
autonomy of the kind which the administra-
tion is currently trying to wipe out. 

Its success is another example of the im-
portance of and student demand for alterna-
tives to busine ses such as those at the High 
Plice Center.

DON~TBELIEVE THE NEGATIVE PORTRAYALS OF MUSLIMS 
Editor: 

The lslami Center of San Diego does not con-
dooe any act of violence against innocent civilians, 
whether such ts are perpetrated by individuals, 
organizations or nations. With regard to the World 
Trade Cenrer bombing. we share the outrage of our 
fellow Americans over the loss of iJUlOCenr lives. 

At the same time. we feel that the cin:wnstances 
surrounding the:urestof a Muslim suspect are murky. 
We encourage an objc:ctive investigation to enswe 
that this man is not being used as a scapegoat to 
reLieve the intense public pressure for an arrest that 
followed the bombing. We caution our fellow citi-
zens to avoid ubscribing to the outrageous notions 
that most or all Muslim are terrorists, that I lam is a 
\'i lem religion and that American Muslims must be 
regarded with fear and suspicion. 

Unfortunately. this is the message we fear is being 
conveyed to the American public by a sometimes 
h ystericaJ news media. in spite of the f tICt that hil.1ori-
cally. very few acts of domestic terrorism have been 
canied out by Muslims. A media double standard is

that have a markedly anti-Islamic bias. 

The effects of thi campaign against American 
Mu lims aresever.li. First. it creates an atmosphere in 
which the civi l right~ of member.. of these communi-
ties can be violated with linle public outcry. For 
instance, it was reported on March 4 that the mosque 
at which the suspect worshipped was closed by the 
FBI. If any church, synagogue or temple were hut 
down imply because a suspect in a crime wor-

~hipped there. a public outcry would (rightfully) 

ensue. We condemn the closure of any mosque as 
a violation of the fundameJ1lal civil righe of free-
dom of religion for American Muslims. 

In addition, we feel that the3lJOOSphereoffear 
and uspicion created allow for escalated di -
crimination and harassment against American 
Muslims. During the Gulf War. American Mus-
lim and Arab-Americans were the targets of FBI 
interrogations and vicious hate crimes which 
included arson. vandalism and even the place-
ment of an incendiary device in the Islamic Center 
of San Diego. 

Such harassment has a "chlllingeffeet" on our 
community. People are afraid to voice their per-
spectives on i ues very dear to them (such as the 
genocide in Bosnia) for fear of becoming the 
targets of FBI harassment or hate crimes by 
ignorant and intolerant individuals. This chilling 
effect may also be exhibited by decreased contri-
butions to lslanlic charities, organizations and 
schools in the United Stales. 

Non-Muslim Americans have 110 reason to 
regard their fellow American Mu lims with fear, 
suspicion or hatred. Similarly, we feel that Ameri-
can Muslim should not have to fear their non-
Mu lim neighbors.

SMOKE: Clearing 
the air at the university 
Continued from page 5 
cans have kicked the habit and more and 
more are 1101 getting started every day. Ln 
search of lost revenue, American to-
bacco companies have turned their at-
tention abroad. focusing on the billions 
of underinfooned peoples of underde-
veloped countries in the Third World. 

"In these poor countries." writes 
Alice Walker in an essay on smoking, 
"as in American ghenos and on reserva-
tions, money that should be spent for 
food goes instead to the tobacco compa-
nies; over time, people starve them-
selves of both food and air. effectively 
weakening and addicting their children, 
eventually eradicating themselves." 

I have seen death in the form of a 
linle white tobacco-tilled wand. , have 
seen family members and fami ly friends 
lowly and effectively kill themselves. 

wheezing through words and coughing 
all the way up a cantankerou flight of 
tairs. I have seen what moking does. 

And till, I made the conscious deci-
sion to have a cigarene every once in a 
while. Which tumed into every now and 
then. Which twned into a linletoo often. 
And is now kind of like a borderline 
problem ... or something. 

What one does with his or her own 
body is his or her own perogative. ThatÂ·s 
a given in my book. Nicotine i addic-
tiveand smoking is not a good habit,juSl 
like caffeine and alcohol and a 101 of 
other thing in thi world But just as 
smokers don't need to be bitched out by 
people who have 110 idea what it's liketo 
really need a cigarene. asthmatics and 
pregnant women don't need someone 
else's problem blowing in their face all 
the time. 

So. in replytomy friend and all other 
UCSD smokers who are down on this 
campus for being down on them. I say 
thi ' : I'm glad UCSD is a" moke-free" 
campus, no maner how annoying it is to 
hear a non-smoker say it. 

Smoking sucks. It's dumb, it kill 
you, it kills those around you and it 
makes the unscrupulously immoral, rich 
white men who own the tobacco com-
panieseven richer. If you havetosmoke, 
which, r realize. is just the way it is with 
smokers, take it somewhere else and 
keep it to yourself. It's only fair,and it's 
only logical. 

KIDNAP: Police

Continued from page 5 
tors compared to those of African-
American perpetrators, it certainly war-
rants questioning. Given the makeup of 
the adm inistration and the prejudiced 
undenones of the university itself, hav-
ing to question one's safety and legiti-
macyas an African-American on this 
campus is enough to boost animosity. 
No one should have to question their 
own safety. especially when they're 
paying for it. Especially with these fees. 

Based on past incidents, this is what 
I see: Anyone whose political reputa-
tion is at Slake with the outcome of this 
case is downplaying it. The facts point-
ing to these cases being racially.oo-
entedarequestionable. Butthat' enough 
to make me stan asking sonne qUeSlions. 

Joseph Watson, the police, and any 
other administrativebody can downplay 
it. But they can't get away from the 
disparity between cases involving white 
victims and cases involving black vic-
tims.Andgoingonthecompositedraw-
ings of African-American u pects, 
you'd have more luck keeping your eye 
out for some minstrel tigure than you 
wouldforthe"average" African-Ameri-
can criminal. 

I think these incidents point 10 neg-
Jigence, and I'd be kidding myself Il()( to 
ask why.

UNCOVERING THE FAlSEHOODS IN THE "CO-OP F ACT SHEET~ 
Editor: 

An anonymous flyer entitled "Co-
op Fact Sheet" was di tributed at the 
Feb. 25 Library Rededication Cer-
emony. This flyer attempt to dispel 
common misconceptions about the 
co-op by utilizing a myth/fact format 
in which a myth is tated and then 
refuted with purported fact. Unfortu-
nately, the authors appear to have 
ome confusion as to what constitutes 

fact and what i indeed a uppo it ion. 
, take particular offense with item 
one and five. which make erroneous 
tatements concerning the efficiency 

of Associated Students Enterprises 
and the notion offair play. Such slan-
derous attacks on the students who 
manage and operate these businesses 
cannot go unchecked. The two items 
from the flyer to which I am referring 
read as follows: 

"I) Myth: Co-ops are being unrea-
sonable and are refusing to make any 
concessions. 

"Fact: Co-ops have agreed to pay 
a 33 percent higher rent, and, in addi-
tion, are taking on payroll co ts, work-
ers' compensation in urance, liabil-
ity in urance, utility costs and gar-
bage cost , meaning that the co-op

don't you?" 

"Yes, ' do," I confessed. The sim-
plicity of his question caught me off 
guard. But that love was becoming 
complicated. I took back with me a 

direct cost will be ignificantly higher 
than that faced by A.S. Enterprises 
uch as Soft Reserve . 

"5) Myth: Co-ops have 'unsound' 
business practices. 

"Fact: The co-op busine se run 
significantly more efficiently than 
A.S. Enterprises. Unlike A.S. Enter-
prises which tend to charge above-
marlcet prices, co-op charge below-
market prices. For instance, the Grove 
Caffe charges roughly five percent 
more for coffee than does Espre 0 
Roma, even though the Grove Caffe 
has roughly the same COT as the co-
op . On the other hand. the co-op are 
about five to 10 percent cheaper than 
their direct competition. the Univer-
siry Bookstore and the Sunshine Store. 
One cannoi maintain this level of 
efficiency without having sound busi-
ness practices." 

These statements paint a false pic-
ture of the situation. To begin with, 
the concessions referred to are merely 
an agreement by the co-ops to pay 
their fair share. Further, the reference 
to a 33 percent rent increase is so 
misleading, it borders on the crimi-
nal. The increase occurs over the life 
of two con ecutive five-year lea es. 

single by the singer Dennis Brown, 
with lyrics so similar to the words of 
the men on the streets: "Go away and 
stay away. YOII ' re acting like a vlIl-
tIlre." 

Last year I wrote about this expe-
rience in the UC Davis paper. A young 
white student wrote me: "I,too, 'love 
black people, .. ' he admined. "But I 
often find that this love conflicts with 
my love for rap music when Ice Cube

and doesn't break the 30 percent bar-
rier until year JI'l'en! During the first 
two leases, their rent is 47 cents per 
square foot - precisely what A.S. 
enterprises housed in the same facil-
ity currently pay. 

I would be interested to see how 
the claim of co-ops facing "signifi-
cantly higher" costs can be substanti-
ated. Our rent and workmen's com-
pen alion insurance are the same, 
which leaves only liability insumnce, 
utilitie and labor cost to consider. 
Since A.S. Enterpri e fall under the 
aegi ofUCSD,wearecurrentlycov-
ered by their blanket insurance policy, 
and also receive the historical waiver 
of utility fee granted all student orga-

promotes violence against Koreans 
or Big Daddy Kane treats women a 
objects for his own pleasure." He then 
asked me some telling questions: 
"Why do I often wonder what black 
people think of me when they see me? 
Why do , feel stupid when my black 
friends tell me to top acting black?" 

This was my advice. ew lan-
guages are not leamed overnight. 
When you ' ve gone into the roots of 

nizations. The co-ops refuse to have 
the ame association, and therefon: 
fall outside this liability and benefit 
umbrella. 

Our position in the university 
means we are also required to pay 
employees at UCSDwage rates which 
are much higher than either the law or 
market dictates. Our minimum wage. 
for example, is 15 percenthigherthan 
any out ide vendorÂ·s. This disparity 
incompensation widens sub tal1lially 
as an employee's duties increase. re-
ulting in an enornlOUS labor cost 

burden for the Enterprises. 
The co-ops. on the other hand. 

must bear no such burden. They pay 
workers very low wages, and in some 
case no wages at all. Even if the A.S. 
could do this, we wouldn't want to. In 
addition to offering needed goods and 
services to the UCSD community. 
A.S. Enterprises create high-paying 
jobopponunities for students. In light 
of astronomical student fees and the 
state of our local economy, this fa tis 
crucial. 

Delving deeper into this abyss of 
absurdity. the tlyersupposedly proves 
A.S. Enterpri es' inefficiency by 
"breaking the tory" that a cup of 

thi culture deep enough, then you ' ll 
be able to taLk in a voice that has black 
"accents" but is your own, with your 
own inflection. When you know your 
history and can talk back without 
trying to talk black, then you' ll find 
plenty of dialogue partners. When 
you're able to love blackness without 
rejecting whitene ,then you'll be 
able to "retum to the condition which 
has no limits."

coffee at the Grove Caffe costs five 
percent more than at Espre so Roma 
(an outside vendor not affiliated with

Even if we were to ignore the 
obvious wage rate di parity between

that Espresso Roma is a large chain 
which takes advantage of its econo-
mies of scale by roasting their own 
coffee beans at a facility in onhern

LOBBY: 
Students' Sacramento 
trip called successful 
Continued from pe&e 2 

"We had our act together," aid 
McCloskey. "We lost a lot of re-
spect we could have gained." 

Neverthele s, mo t of the stu-
dents agreed that the trip was a 
succe s. 

"It was a real positive thing:' 
said McOoskey. "We got to talk 
face to face with a hell of a lot of 
legi lators." 

Monday'sevenr werepreceded 
by a weekend conference where UC 
and CSU students attended work-
hops to learn about current tudent 

initiatives and lobbying techniques. 
According to Bolivar, these "is-

sue ses ions" trained students how 
the legislative process works and 
how it can be influenced. 

,, [ think student got a lot out of 
it," said Wilson. "It was a good 
leamingexperiencefor tudentsand 
a politica l how of strength for the 
organization." 

Iioimesemphasizedthat the lob-
bying campaign wa only the " first 
hit" and that student leaders are plan-
mng to follow la~t wee~end's ef-
fons 'Wi th letters . phone call s and 
more meerings with state officia ls. 

"We WIll continue analyzing each 
and every single bill Ihat affecLs 
Mudents," said Bolivar. 

"We will go to the budget and 
education hearings [and] the regent 
nominations and voice student con-
cern ," he aid. 

UCSD has already embarked on 
aletler-writingcampaign, ponsored 
by the A.S. According to 
McCloskey, an information packet 
containing tip on writing a letter, 
addresses oflegislators and asample 
letter are available at EDNA. 

A drop box is located at the Main 
Gym where students can put their 
letters. No envelope or stamp is 
required at the drop box and the 
letters can be handwritten . 

McCloskey said that the letters 
will be "an incredible follow-up to 
the lobbying we've been doing," 
About 200 letters have been col-
lected so far. 

McCloskey urged students to 
write letters, saying that complaints 
are useless unless they are directed 
at the people who have the power to 
change the situation, 

" I think the student want to do 
something and this is something 
easy we can do," aid McCloskey, 
noting that ittakes about 10 minutes 
to write a letter. 

"lfwe have letters to back us up, 
we're set," he added.

Creativity in diverse genres has made Philip Glass an internationally-renowned artist. TheAmericancom-
poser, whose music has often been 
tenned "minimalism," has written 
for opera, film , theater and dance. 

Glass is currently touring the , 
country performing the Powaqqals; 
soundtnlck and will perfoon the 
music to the film live in Mandeville 
Auditorium on Friday, March 26. 

During a recent phone interview, 
Glass di cussed hi s theories of mu-
sic and his desire to communicate 
with the general public.

Glass: Low Symphony is based 
on music that David Bowie and 
Brian Eno composed in 1977. It 
was a very well-known record at the 
time because it went way beyond 
what we usually associate with pop 
music. It was very ambitious [be-
cause] it wasn't madejust as a com-
mercial venture. It was made with a 
real idea of experimentation. And a 
lot of people took notice of that 
record, people in the field of experi -
mentation. 

I had thought that it was a really 
wondelful record, but [didn ' t really 
have any idea about whal to do . 
Some years later, in fact, very re-

No. It depend . Vel)' often im-

there are no images for me. 
WMt Is your opinion on ....

mu.? 

Ah, I don't have an opinion so 
much on that. I think that some pieces 
have been urprising because people 
didn't expect them. For example, 
when Powaqqarsi first started out, 
the amount of percussion that came 
to the piece was a urprise for people, 
becau e they didn't associate that 
with my music. But that wasn't a 
strategy of mine. To surprise people 
i not pan of the strategy. 
WMt Is your deftnltlon of "mu-

"Romantic" has to do With per-
sonalization of the e is ues. 1t might 
be, and it might not be. Forexample, 
an opera about Ghandi i not roman-
tic at all, but it's vel)' emotional and 
vel)' sensual. But the idea of the 
romantic image of the love and the 
beloved and this kind of thing may 
not come into play. 

So it depends on the piece. Again, 
with Po'ti'aqqarsi, the piece we wi ll 
be playing at UCSD, it does have a 
romance, but it has a lot of emotion 
in it. And then when we play the 
music live, as we're doing, the emo-
tional impact of the live performance

Where does Philip Glass see

that what it's done for me is allowed 
me to develop a coherent music of

or fi ve years that I feel that [have the 
technique to do all that I want to do. 

And so I feel that. in many ways. 
my best music is in front of me. It's 
taken me a long time to establish my 
own musical language. but my own 
organization, my own ensembleand 
audience. record-buying public -
al\ these things weredevelopedover 
a period of 25 years. And I'm very 
much looking forward to theoppor-

HUTTO 
Padres' Fire 
Sale Continues 

Spring training this year can only 
mean one thing to thoSe many baseball-
starVed fans of San Diego: it's time to 
start saving up for football season. 

As ju t about every Tom, Dick, and 
Jane knows, the 1993 San Diego Padres 
are downsizing their budget. and 
dumping just about anyone who goof 
and reveal a slivering glimpse of talent. 

Gone from last year ' third-place NL 
West team include four-time All tar 
shortStop Tony Femandez, sem to the 
New York Mets for OJ. Dozier and 
some other no-name, pilcher Wally 
Whitehurst. Just what San Diego needs. 
another running back. Another AllÂ· 'ltar, 
catcher Benito Santiago, went the route 
of free-agency to sign with the 
expansion Rorida Marlin~ . 

Probably the league's most 
undennted cenlcrtielder. Darrin Jackson 
is urremly bdng ,hopped around. 
Perhaps they ould sign r. Louis' Brian 
Jordan, another former football player 
who &lill think~ you're supposed to 
spike the ball after a reception. 

Starting pitcher Jim Deshaie:. and 
relievers Randy Myers, Jose Melendez, 
Larry Anderson and Mike Maddux 
have all left. Bruce Hurst, now 
rehabilitating from postseason surgery, 
is also rumored to be on his way out. 

All right, what does that leave u 
with? Nothing less than the worst 
bullpen in the division, a shaky and 
unproven staIting rotation, a very weak 
middle infield, speed to match running 
molasses and a manunoth hitting lead-
off vacancy. 

Aside from right fielder Tony 
Gwynn, third baseman Gary Sheffield, 
and first baseman Fred McGriff, the 
offensive output appears minimal. 
Probable left fielder Phil Planrier, 
second basemen Jeff Gardner or Craig 
Shipley, shortstop Kurt Stillwell and 
veteran catcher Mike Scioscia could 
produce some offensive punch, bur that 
remains a big "if." If lone speedster 
Darrell Sherman can't get on base, 
Sheffield and McGriff will not have 
many runners to bat in. 

Leading the mound from will be 
Andy Benes, the lone double-figure 
winner on the staff. With the rest of the 
rotation consisting of oft-injured Greg 
Harris, Frank Seminara. Whitehurst and 
a toss-up for who is the best of the worst 
for the fifth starter, look for the Pads to 
battle Colorado for the division's worst 
ERA and most losses. 

The relief looks worse. With six 
saves total from last year, Roger Mason, 
Tim Scon, Jeremy Hemandez, and 
Gene Hams wiu battle it out for the 
closing position. Look for the Padres to 
lose a lot of games when they are ahead 
by a mere two or three runs in the late 
inning . 

Rookie manager Jim Riggleman and 
the Padre organization will cenainly 
have their hands full this season, but 
most certainly not in the cash dcpan-
menl Let 's face it, if the Padres are 
going to stan a minor league team. they 
should expect to puU in minor league 
profits.

Diane Chandler helped UCSD to a near-upset of Iowa State, winning both her singles match and her doubles showdown Tuesday. 

Cyclones Snap Triton String 
WOMEN'S TENNIS: UCSD falls to 
Iowa State 54; Chandler wins twice 
By Bfee Segal 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women 's tennis team faced Divi-
sion I Iowa State University Tuesday afternoon, 
losing 5-4 and marking the Tritons' first los of the 
1993 season. Head Coach Liz LaPlante, not antici-
pating such a close final score, was surprised and 
pleased with the overall performance of UCSD 
despite the defeat, explaining that Iowa State's 
quality tennis pushed UCSD to play hard and fight 
tough. 

Diane Chandler, 
UCSD's number-two 
player, won her singles 
match and took no prison-
ers with her win of 6-1, 64. 
Chandler went on to play 
doubles with teammate 
Heather Wiliams, capturing 
yet another win. The flfSt 
etwaslo t7-5. The women 

quickly flred back, how-
ever, taking the nexl two 
sets, 6-4, 6-3. 

"We did well compared 
to what we thought we 

would do. It was really tough and exhausting. We 
fought for [the wins), they didn't win easy. Every-
body played well," Chandler said. 

"That was our toughest competition. Today 
was a good experience because they were Division 
I. It's good 10 go out and play tougher leams," 
Williams added.

Tritons Blow Their 
Chances in Loss 
BASEBAI I â€¢ UCSD falls 3-0 to nwnrer -one Cal Lutheran 
By GreaWrem 
Sports Editor 

It was the one that got away. Despite 
a strong pitching perfOl'l1'laOCe by SIarta' 
Steve Height, the UCSO baseball team 
couldn't 00ck him up in the Tritons' 
3-0 loss to the nation's top-ranked team, 
Cal Lutheran. 

The sophomore Height went the 
distance for UCSD, allowing only four 
hits with four strikeouts and no walks. 
Most imponant was his final tatistic-
no earned runs. 

"We had another outstanding start-
ing pitching job. It was a case of very 
bad defense and not taking advantage of 
our opportunities," UCSD Head Coach 
Lyle Yates said The Kingsmen, on the 
other hand, took full advantage of theirs. 
CLU sCored all of its runs in the fourth 
inning when two Triton errors gave the 

Kingsmen two men on with one out 
instead of the end of the inning. The next 
batter launched a three-run bIasI that 
proved to be the only scoring Cal 
Lutheran needed. 

UCSO had a chance to draw first 
blood in the third when Craig Birk and 
Glen Nahmias singled. "But we failed 
to execute after that and we carne up 
with nothing," Yates said. 

The Tritons also blew chances 10 
score in the fOuM, sixth and eighth 
frames. "We were missing our clutch 
hitting which proved to be the differ-
ence. They had it and we dido 't," Y ares 
said 

"'The score was close, but we should 
have been in control early on. We're 
going to have our work cut out for us thi 
year to start scoring consistently," Y ares 
said

Yumi Takemoto, number-five

knew it was a Division I school," she 
said. 

Takemoto <'lnd Birdie Gessford 
faced a difficult 10 of 6-4, 6-2 in 
doubles. "It got really dark, it was 
hard to see. We were both really tired 
and they were good players," aid 
Takemoto. 

The next match is scheduled for 
Saturday at the University of 
Redlands. lnaba aid he sees 
Redlands as an opportunity for her to 
te t out new techniques and offensive 
strategies. 

The team is halfway through the

ented player and an experienced 
coach. LaPlante, recently named 
Coach of the Decade, is the driving 
force behind the tearn. 

UniDspired UCSD Does Just Enough tons their sixth win of the afternoon. The Tritons (2-3) begin a grueling five-match home series next Monday 
when they host Colorado College. 
UCSD will ha;t Division ill matches

College, Redlands, and Williams duro

evaluate the Tritons against Division ill 
competition. "We've been playing 
against tearns like USC, Stanford and 
Cal. I'd like to see where we are against 
Divi ion ill," Ditzler said Ditzler is 
confident that the Tritons will regain 
their focus. 'The matches over spring 
break will bedifferenl We won't rest on 
our laurels," the coach said

Mastadons Masticate UCSD in Three 
VOLlEYBAll: UCSD till winl after loss to Indiana-Purdue, Fort Wayne 
By Blair Rlcley 
Staff Writer 

Winning isn't everything, but try 
telling thar to the UCSD men's voUey-

match sank to 0-18 on the season. The 
Tritons were blown out at home by 
Indiana-Purdue University, FortWayne. 
15-6, 15-9, 15~. â€¢ 

With the Mastadons controlling ev-
ery game of the match. the Tritons 
couldn't seem to get out of neutral. 

The visitors jumped to a 5.n lead in 
the first game, using inpenettable block-
ing and an awesome display of hitting. 

The Tritons scored their f1J'Sl point 
when Mitchell Yap hammered a clean 

pike to make the score 5-1. 
Crdig Collins and Raul Papaleo re-

ponded with consecutive kills to give 
Fort Wayne a ix-point edge, 7- \. 
Papaleo led all players with 10 kills. 

UCSO lookedasthough it was ready 
tostageacomeback when MattMinehan 
n(){chcd a kill following a jump-serve 
by Travis Ferguson. Torn Black fol-
lowed Minehan's example by pound-
ing a kill of his own to cut the Mastadon 
lead to 7-3. Fort Wayne then scored 
three srraighl points using Triton errors 
and its own kills to Slake a 10-3 lead 

The Tritons climbed back into the 
game with a block by Kerr and Fort 
Wayne errors. making the score 11 -6. 

Then the Mastadons scored the fI nal 
four points of the game to clinch, 15-6. 

Fort Wayne continued its mastery 
over UCSD in the second game as they 
jumped to a quick 11 -2Iead. 

The Tritons received a wake-up call 
when Yap produced a service ace to 
make the score 11-3. A net violation by 
the Mastadons cut the lead to 11-4. 

The Tritons then cut the lead to four 
when Black hammered a km to make 
the score 13-9. The MasUldons took the 
next two points and the game, 15-9.

The men's basketball 
team started out slowly 
but eventually got roiling, 
winning 10 of their last 
11 games and finishing 
with a 17-8 record. UCSD 
was left out of the NCAA 
tournament In a surprising 
decision, despite the best 
efforts of Chris Moore 
who led the team In 
scoring and was named to 
the All-West Region first 
team.

ewal SOFIBAU.: UCSD can't 
find offense in two losses to 
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo 
By Gregg Wrenn sportswear 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD softball team lost its 
seventh and eighth games in a row on 
Sunday, dropping both end of a 
doubleheader (0 Divi ion n Cal Poly-
San Lui Obi po. 

clothing 
The Mu tangs 

trounced the Tri -
tons 10-0 in the 
first game before 
UCSD slowed 
San Luis down in 
the econd, 10 ing 
5-0. 

The Tri10n de-
fense was as ab-
sent as 1he offense 

in game one. "We were missing rou-
tine plays, they were mental errors," 
said UCSD Head Coach Patricia 
Gercken . "But Cal Poly was really 
good, a very deepÂ·hitting team," 

UCSD found ome of its defen e 
in the second game to help pitcher 
Cathy 0 'Connor, but the offense was 
as moribund as ever. 

This has become a worrisome trend 
for Gerckens , team. "Our bats need to 
come alive," she said. "We have been 
challenged this season and we've got 
a 101 of games left, so the wins will 
come." 

The Tritons have not been hun yet 
by the fact that they only have I 1 
players. "Obviously when I want to 
put in a pinch runner or ome1hing 
like that, I can't do it all the time, but 
basically it hasn't been a problem." 
Gerckens said. 

Despite the I -8 start. the coach is 
optimistic about the rest of this sea-
son. The Tritons have yet to playa 
Division m team, thus far dealing 
with four Division II teams and an 
NAIA squad. 

"When we stan to play our Divi-
sion m schedule, the wins will start to 
come," Gerckens said. "They; I come 
before that as long as we keep believ-
ing in ourselves."

SOCCER Basketball Dream team 
Distinguished panel selects basketball's best 

Intramural Cup Finals OK, so the squad that went to Barcelona had some fair talent Sure Magic, Jordan, Laettner and the gang wal<ed allover the rest of the 
world, but were they as good as these All-Stars? All we know here at the 1M Dept. 
is that they declined an invitation to lace 'em up against UCSD's Dream Team. You 
can draw your own conclusion. 

The Intramural Cup Soccer Championships will be held this coming weekend in fronl of a capacity crowd 
at the North Campus Rae fields. Having seen us struggle through a rather tough rainy season, the 1M 
God's decided to bless us with beautiful weather for the playoHs. Teams that are competing for The Cup 
have truly earned their keep, as every team in every division made it to playoHs. Some teams will have 

A blue ribbon pane/was commissioned to identify the five best players In the program. 
After pouring over stat sheets. sitting through hundreds of games and watching hours 
of video they finally found the five players worthy of being called All-1M. played and won as many as 5 rounds of games en route 10 their btles. 

Come on out. grab some rays, and join us for exerting 1M Cup action.

This Spud Webb clone runs the show for the highly rated A JERK & A SQUIRT in 
Men's AA and LAUNCHING PAD'S BACK in Coed AA. He averaged 14.7 assists. 
9 steals and 12.6 points per game. He posted triple doubles in 8 games to lead IM's 
in that department. 'I grew up In a small backwater town not too far from Sacramento 
and when the Kings picked up Spud. Hey, I was a fan for hfe. I love hiS game: Carlo 
couldn't get either team into the finals, but he had a big year. 
Shootln. Guard: Uncoln Combs, 1'4", Junior 

rne follOWing teams may not have made rt to the finals. but showed us all how to have fun Ifl the true SPlnt of Intramural Sports. 
Congralulatlons on earning 1M Sports hlQhest honor ... recognilion for oulstandlng sportsmanship. Give yourselves a pat on the back! 

How can a guy shooting 35% be featured as a shooter? Easy. It's his complete lack 
of conscience. He gives himself the green light when he gets out of the car in the 
parking lot. Ya. he's nearty broken a lew backboards with some of hiS long range 
grenades. but no-one else is regularly heaving up 25, 35 and 45 footers. He throws 
up as much trash as he talks. Who cares if they aren't falling, just haVing the guts

Three Strikes-You're Outl

as Adam Muzikant racked up their sixth split. Jon Oh carne on as the closer and did just that, 
striking out the side (a clutch turkey if you will) giving "Menage" tKe 12 pin comeback victory and 
the 1M Crown. 

'The Pom House" took the 3rd place match as Mandy Johnson also put together three
