While the Cedar and Paradise 
fires that burned nearly 300,000 
acres, killed 17 people and 
destroyed over 2,400 homes in 
San Diego county never reached 
the UC D campus, the fires' dev-
astating effects were felt by the 
campu community in a wide vari-
ety of ways. 

University officials cited mul-
tiple reasons for their decision to 
close the campus for three con-
secutive days from Oct. 27 to 
Oct. 29. These included obeying 
county officials' request of keep-
ing the roads open for emergency 
vehicles, dangerously poor air 
quality on campus caused by the 
moke, and consideration fo r 

those II1divlduals In the SD 
community directly affected by 
the fires. 

School was reopened on Oct. 
30 due to greatly improved air 
quality and greater containment of 
the fire. 

"There was never any concern 
of the fire coming to campus," 
Director of University 

ommunications Barry Jagoda 
aid. 

Veteran univers ity officials 
could not remember a previous 
emergency clo edown of the uni-
ve rsity. 

During the days of clo ure, on-
campus residents were asked to

avoid breathing particles in the air. 

" It wa really eerie drivi ng 
around campus when nobody was 
around," UCSD Police Officer AI 
J enkins said . " It looked like the 
end of the world." 

According to Jenkin , the cam-
pu remained "qui et" and the 
campus police were mo tly kept 
busy by people calling the station 
with inquiries about the fires 
instead of calling the established 
campus emergency hotline.

Report claims campus 'hostile' 
Concilio says UCSD unwelcoming to Hispanics 

College Board report 
shows fees, aid up 

By VLADIMIR KOGAN 
Staff Writer 

UCSD Hispanic srudents and 
staff find a "hostile" on-campus 
environment and "serious igno-
rance" of their academic needs on 
the part of tOP adhlinistrators, 
according to a report card recent-
ly released by the campus' 
ChicanolLatino Concilio. 

"The current conditions for 
Chicano/Latinos at UCSD are 
indeed dire," the report stated. "A 
critical public instirution with an 
incredible amount of educational 
resources is vi rtually inaccessible 
to the ChicanofLatino community 
of San Diego County." 

Participants in the report felt 
that no progre s had been made in 
recent years. 

"The overall bottom line is that 
we feel, in the three important 
areas of srudents, faculty and staff, 
there's been vi rtually no progress 
under the tenure and administra-
tion of Chancellor [Robert C.] 
Dynes, who is now President 
Dynes," said Patrick Velasquez, 
di rector of Office of Academic 
Support and Instructional 
Services, who was among the 
group that prepared the study for a 
community summit. 

The percentage of Latinos and 
Chicano enrolled as freshmen has 
remained at approximately 10 per-
cent of their class over the last five 
year, the report claimed, though 
Hispanics make up more than 30 
percent of parts of San Diego 
county. The study al 0 found that 
only one out of every four Latino 
and Chicano students that are 
offered admission ch ose to ancnd 
,blaming, among other things, the 
lack of Chicano-related issues in 
the curriculum, few Hispanic fac-

ulty members and "racist" articles 
in the Koala student newspaper. 

"Most important, the inability 
of the campus to increase the 
number of Chicano srudents is the 
result of deep-seated elitism that 
permeates facu lty attirudes and 
dete rmines policy decisions made 
by the UCSD Academic Senate 
committees," the report card stat-
ed. "There is a strong belief that 
rea l diversity means ' lowering 
standards' and that underrepre-
sented students would be 'better 
off going to community college.' " 

Some felt that the problem did 
not stem from the campus directly. 

"I frankly think some of the 
problems are not UCSD, but La 
Jolla," John Skrentny, a UCSD soci-
ology professor, said. "I think that 
this is a university that is in a very 
wealthy neighborhood and there is 
not much Latino culture around 
here. There is not much of ethnic 
culture around here of any kind ." 

In addition to low anendance, 
the report found the ix-year grad-
uation rate for Chicano students to 
be 69 percent, 12 percent less than 
that of all UCSD srudents, blaming 
the gap on weak institutional sup-
port and poor social conditions. It 
also found that fewe r Chicano stu-
dents come back year after year. 

"[A low graduation rate) is a 
problem that exi t not just at 
UCSD but across the country. 
Lati nos have higher dropout rates 
than other srudents and the socio-
logical evidence on that points to 
lower economic resources," 
Skrentny said. "Students are 
expected to work - to help pay 
for their education - and often to 
work to help support their fami-
lies. They have greater demands 
on their time and it's harder to 
make the commitment to stay in

school when you have these finan -
cial obligations on you." 

John Muir College freshman 
Maria Sanchez said she did not 
work. 

"My family doesn't expect me 
to work, because education comes 
first," Sanchez said, adding that 
her falnily was not representative 
of the entire culrure. 

"I wanted to see diversity," she 
said, explaining that she came to 
the ca mpus from the largely 
Hispanic communi ty of Pixley, 
Calif. However, she said the lack 
of Hispanic srudents at UCSD 
disturbs her. 

"There is very little Hispanic 
culture here, actually. There are 
not very many of us," Sanchez 
said. "It makes me wonder why 
there aren't many (Hispanics) 
here. Is it because we're not as 
capable as the rest at earning a 
position here, because I know it's 
very competitive?" 

One of the major impediments 
in the recruitment of Hispanic 
students has been the unwilling-
ness to hire and retain Hispanic 
faculty, the report stated. 

"There are 41 people in the 
campus who work at the highest 
level, as managers and top admin-
istrators, and out of tho e 41 peo-
ple, only one is Latino," Velasquez 
said. "The other really troubling 
issue wi th rega rd to facul ty is tha t 
in the last four years, we've lost 
three young Chicano faculty who 
were denied tenure. These were 
relatively young assistant profes-
sors who went through the 
process, and who we felt should 
have been awarded tenure." 

The university, which did not 
respond to specifics in the report,

Findings show actual 
average paid fees down 

By BRYAN TSAO 
Staff Writer 

With a slumping economy and 
risi ng tuition affecting students 
across the country, the College 
Board released a study detailing 
trends in college pricing and finan-
cial aid on Oct. 21. The srudy 
found that fees for tuition and 
room and board at four-year public 
instirutions increased an average of 
$947 for the 2003-04 academic 
year, with shrinking state budgets 
causi ng an increase in ruition and 
fees nationwide. 

However, the smdy also found 
that, nationally, colleges distributed 
a record total of $105 billion in 
grant aid, ca using the average fees 
paid out of students' pockets to 
actually decrease compared to last 
year. 

With the state of California 
undergoing a budget crisis and 
cutting the Unive rsity of 
California budget by $410 mil-
lion, UCS D was not immune to 
this trend , increasing fees by 
$1,150 fo r California residents 
for the 2003-04 academic year. 
Despite the increase, UCSD's 
fees for California residents, cur-
ren tly at $4,984, rema in well 
below the national average for 
public four-year institut ions, 
which the College Board reports 
as $10,636. 

The fee increase comes after 
seven years of stable or decreasing 
fees for the University of California 
in which fees declined a total of 10 

percent. Grants will also cover the 
full fee increase for 40 percent of 
UCSD's students. 

"Srudies show that the grant aid 
goes up much faster than the 
increase in fees, something like 84 
percent," UCSD Director of 
Fi nancial Aid Vincent De Anda 
said. "One of the reasons for this i 
as fees go up, more money is 
rerurned to financial aid in the uni-
versity aid program. Also, the Cal 
Grant program will cover the full 
increase in fees for low-income 
students." 

Many UCSD students are 
greatly helped by financial aid. 

"The aid program at UCSD is 
great," Sixth College freshman 
Nicholas Ledesma said. "Without 
the program they have here, I 
would not be able to attend thi 
university. I think it's awesome that 
other people would help pay for 
my education." 

Despite the budget CutS, the 
financial aid program has remained 
relatively unaffected, with over 
$14 I million in grants, loans and 
scholarships distributed for the 
2002 -03 academic year. early all 
financial aid comes in the form of 
fede ral Pell grants fo r low-income 
students, state sponsored Cal 
G rants for low-income tudents 
who meet certain academic 
requirements, a UC Grant that is 
derived from student fees or a fed-
eral Stafford loan. Grant aid , which 
doesn't need to be repaid, account-

Assistant III salary starts at $4, 512 LESS per year than an Administrative 
Assistant III. Library Assistants are the lowest paid employees in the 
Clerical Unit. Library Assistant morale is at a twenty year low, retention of 
quality employees a thing of the past. 

While we have taken on more and more responsibility for higher level 
work, we have been ignored when we have asked for equ ity salary 
increases. After years of begging , we finally had hope - UC agreed to bar-
gain for equity salary increases for us when Clerical Bargaining began in 
August 2003. We worked hard to do presentations to the Office of the 
President to show the skill tevels necessary to do our jobs. On October 22, 
UC reneged on its promise. Once again UC has the money, but Library 
Assistants just aren't a priority. 

UC Library Assistants are paid much less than in the California State 
System , the Community College System and in many Public Libraries . We 
aren't asking for salary equity with these institutions - we just want to be 
paid at least as much as the underpaid Administrative Assistants at UCSD. 
We are only asking for the equity we should have received ten years ago. 
We have been punished for loving our jobs, working harder and taking on 
more responsibility - we can no longer pay our bills and support our fami-
lies. The quality of your Libraries can only be preserved by recruiting and 
retaining the best Library Assistants - that will not continue to happen w ith-
out support from the entire University community.

Students showed insensitivity 
BY EVELYN HSIEH 

Senior Staff Writer 
omulity, like it often does, 

served as a harbinger for catastro-
phe. Sunny blue skies finally 
appeared last week:, after what 
eemed liKe years of ambaguous, 

overcasr weather. It was a welcome 
relief &om the shades of gray, and it 
seemed as if old friends were recon-
CIled again. San Diego and gor-
geous weather are supposed to be 
betrothed to each other. So in a 
sen • at IC3lot weather-wise, every-
thmg was baclc to normal Shuttles 
run, people go to work and school, 
joggers relish the relurn of the 
morning sun. The only dlsruption 

is from the strikers in £ron t of the 
grocery store, who do some harass-
ing when you just want to buy your 
salsa. For the most part, though, 
everything was pretty normal. 
Herein lies the setting for sudden 
fear, confusion and disorder. 

The massive fires that swept 
through San Diego County caught 
most of us off-guard. 1 looked out 
the wmdow on the morning of Oct. 
26 and grumbled about what I 
thought was a return of the somber 
weather. I wish it were only that. &; 
we all figured out at one point or 
another, it wu a firestorm that 
would devour hWldreds of thou-
~ds of acres and scar many more 
lives. If It cut deep into the con-

!lci~ of San Diego, then, bow 
did it affect us UCSD students? 

Fint, I must admit to an intense 
cynicism. I aJso tend to be oversen-
sitive about certain issues. incl uding 
appropriate reactions to deY2$tation 
and tragedy. That being said, the 
insensitivity I encountered rep-d-
ing the fires is probably more than 
a little tlinted by my own jaded-
ness. &; students who aren't readily 
Ul the path of danger, I guess it's a 
bit unreasonable to expect an out-
pouring of grief or empathy. 
However, sometimes it seemed like 
everyone was only worried about 
school. From what T read or heard

Thinned forests

The fires that ravaged San

most destructive in recent history.

acres ofland, tOrched over I ,000 
homes, killed a few people, and

MONDAY. N VEMBER 3. 2003 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Student apathy and selfishness 
in midst of crisIs is disheartening 

Most UCSD students have no sense of 
attachment to the San Diego community 

Quoth the 
ravin' 

Evan Mclaughlin 

I 'm still scratching my head after the events that tran-spired last week in the wake 
of the most damaging natural cat-
astrophe, aside from the 1989 
Lorna Prieta earthquake, that I've 
ever been a part of. And it's not 
because the fires ripped through 
over 750,000 acres in Southern 
California or that thousands of 
homes were destroyed in the 
process - it was the reaction to 
the fire and the disarray that fol-
lowed that keep me puzzled. 

Just like the rest of my neigh-
borhood and many more, I woke 
up on Oct. 26 to a cloud of steel 
wool spanning the entire sky's 
ceiling. Everything in the horizon 
was pink and thick with ash . The 
driveway, the cars and the patio 
were all caked in black and it 
reeked like campfire. Without 
watching television, I had no idea 
what caused this Doomsday con-
dition or how much of the city was 
screwed as a result, but just by 
standing outside, you could tell 
things weren't right. 

By the time the local news 
briefed me on the severity and 
ultra-close proximity of the fire, 1 
was already phoning Vegas for the 

over-under line on the number of 
jerks who would gripe to me 
about the Fox and CBS channels 
showing fire coverage instead of 
football. Within moments, I was 
contacted by a number of 
acquaintances irate about the fact 

they weren 't watching the 
Broncos-Ravens game. 

[ mention this incident and a 
number of others where the local 
fires were seen as a mere factor in 
a person's day rather than the 

" It was the reaction to the fire an the disarray that 
followed that keeps 

me puzz.led. " 
larger issue at hand. [t was dis-
heartening to see my peers just 
completely disconnected to the 
trauma swirling in their own 
backyard, viewing the fire as an 
inconvenience or, with the subse-
quent school closures, as advanta-
geous. 

While I think this was a con-
scious assessment on the part of 
many of my peer and myself at 
times, I think there has to be a 
reason why relief projects were 
filled with San Diego volunteers 
that included the usual bunch of 
involved UCSD students, but the 
same apathy exhibited so fre-

quently by our student body on 
campus issues carried over to the 
recent fires , as well. 

Perhaps it was that simple -
Students who exhibit little involve-
ment on campus were just apathet-
ic across the board. These individ-
uals are too absorbed in their 
Counterstrike, weekend party 
plans or O -chem to give a hoot 
about civic responsibility or the 
sense of community. I've heard, 
and often accepted, the argument 
that these individuals just don't 
care about the UCSD community 

that the university has not 
made an effort to entice the under-
graduate for support. I buy that for 
a number of factors: low student 
election turnout, low attendance to 
sporting events involving our 
nationally ranked Triton tearns, the 
abysmal alumni giving rate (ranked 
191 out of248 national universities 
when we boast a top-40 overall 
ranking). the UC tudy stating 
UCSD has the unhappiest under-
grnduates in the system and the 
absolute disgust I see in people's 
eyes when [ pass my peers on 
Library Walk to class (if, of course, 
they actually do look up long 
enough for me to see their eyes). 

This is a result of the "tradi-
tion of no tradition" at UCSD, as 
then-Chancellor Robert C. Dynes 
put it in his 2002 state of the cam-
pus address. While this mantra 
may be the appropriate mindset 
for an institution working toward

from some people. that was the only 
thing in their minds. Having school 
cancelled for three days speaks for 
itself; the magnitude of the event 
must be pretty substantial. Students 
would surely meet the long break in 
classes with either enthusiasm or 
confusion, but for some people, it 
seemed like all they cared about 
were their midterms. OK, I know we 
are college students and exams are 
supposed to be our life. but people 
are dying and you're worried about 
the time of your midterm? I under-
stand your role as a student, but 
please, everything will work itself 
out. It just seemed inappropriate in 
the scope of things. 

I admittedly was relieved when [ 
heard we wouldn 't have school, 
although [ became antsy when [ 
learned Oct. 29 classes were can-
celled. Its perfectJy reasonable for 
students to be glad of having no 
school. In fact, ['m sure some of us 
felt like it was , a needed vacation. 
However, the vacation came at a 
huge expense. [ couldn't help but 
feel guilty that the firemen were 
working some 20 hours a day while 
we were getting a three-day break 
from school and celebrating. It's a 
strange situation, really, because [ 
can't blame anyone for rejoicing 
over a break from school, but nei-
ther can I condone the fact that we 
did. 

It also seemed like a lot of people 
were more worried about the ash on 
their cars, dust in their hair, difficul-
ty breathing and whamot than about 
the fire itself. The fires were an 
inconvenience, an annoyance, and 
nothing more. 

It may be pretty unfair to hold 
college students accountable for 
their somewhat selfish thoughts 
about the disaster. And to expect 

anything more is also equally unrea-
sonable. What can you expect from 
20-year-olds who do little but study, 
drink and hang out all day? 
Sympathy? Empathy? [t takes some-
thing deeply personal to affect the 
constant flow of life. 

Of course, it's not as if everyone 
is supposed to share in the agony of 
the fires . Indeed, many probably 
wanted to get their mind off of the 
disaster. On the up side, it was 
encouraging to hear that the Red 
Cross centers were overflowing with 
vol unteers and even had to turn 
some away. Also, last week's 
Associated Students collections 
drive was another proactive way to 
help the seemingly helpless situa-
tion. 

The school, in a typically bureau-
cratic manner, issued the same state-
ments everyday citing the reasons 
for closing the campus. You always 
hear of "deepest sympathies" and 
"cause for concern" and such, but 
does it register in your mind as sin-
cere? 

School started up again on Oct. 
30. Midterms were moved, and 
some material will have to be cut 
from courses. But all in all, that's 
nothing. It's a trivial, simplistic mat-
ter compared to the complex, ardu-
ous and saddening task ahead for so 
many others who have lost their 
homes or loved ones. Ashes on the 
windshield wipers that were once 
support beams in someone's home 
are to be whisked away by an 
annoyed driver. It·s just a fact of life 
that true empathy is not possible, 
especially at the collegiate level. 
Come finals week, it will all be just 
another memory of a time when it 
was dark around noon and we had a 
few days off from school. Everything 
will be back to normal. Shouldn't 
that be our deepe t fear?

UCSD's decision to dose the 

campus was a commendable one -
keeping classes open would have 
done significantly more harm than 
good. 

True, we're paying a lot for our 
education, and three days of missed 
class aren't usually easy [Q make up. 
But when 13 -plus people die and 
nea rly 2,000 homes are de troyed 
- and, for that matter, when 
you're living in an official state of 
emergency - a few days of school 
ju t don 't matter that much any-
more. It would have been prelen-
tiou and inconsiderate of UCSD 
[Q place its own desires above the 
needs of the community (as if we 
need any more stereotypes about 
clueless, self-centered college kids, 
anyhow). 

Furthermore, the closure of 
campus did ultimately benefit stu-
dents.

protected students from the near-
toxic air quality. So many particles 
from the fire were filling the air that 
even surgical masks were complete-
ly ineffective; the only way to pro-
tect one's lungs wa to stay inside. 
That became a whole lot easier with 
the cancellation of classes. 

Additionally, those students

evacuations were held were given 
at least a little peace of mind by not 
having [Q worry about missing 
classes. 

Tea hers, too, have taken the 
situation in stride. ome have post-
poned midterms slightly, or are 
assigning reading at a marginally 
more rapid pace, or have simply cut 
less-important parts of the material 
out of the syllabus. 

There have been rumors that 
our Christmas break might be 
truncated slightly to make up for 
the days lost last week. First of all, 
that's just a rumor, and an unlikely

one at that. 
Secondly - yeah, it would be 

too bad if we got home for 
Christmas a little late. But try 
telling that to the (former) home-
owners in Scripps Ranch and see if 
that earns much sympathy. [t 
shouldn't. At least we have homes. 

School resumed on Oct. 30. 
Back in class and away from the 
ashes, and with the news starting to 
focus on a few other topics, it's easy 
to feel as though the fires pretty 
much over. 

But it isn't for our neighbors in 
Escondido, Julian and any other 
place where more houses were 
burned than were left standing. 
Rebuilding a life will take a lot 
longer than the few days it took to 
get back into the college class rou-
tine. 

There are definitely those who 
make up for the slightly disheart-
ening attitude of some students. 
The Associated Students, for 
example, held a donation drive in 
which items such as food , water 
and blankets were collected for fire 
VIctims. The Still Thoughts 
Organization sold gifts, the pro-
ceeds from which also benefited 
fire victims. Muslim Students 
Association will donate a dollar to 
the cause for every non-Muslim 
student who participates in an 
upcoming fast. 

And it's definitely not too late 
to pitch in. The Red Cross, for 
one, is still accepting monetary 
donations. There's a meeting Nov. 
3 at 5 p.m . at Half Dome Lounge 
at John Muir College to make 
pacl:ages for those whose homes 
were lost. 

So props to those who get over 
their own concerns and help the 
r(al victims of the fire. 

continued from page 4 
Inspired by Bush's calls a year 

ago in Oregon and the recent 
California fires, Feinstein's plan has 
already been challenged by envi-
ronmentalists who have charged 
that the modified plan is just a 
blank check for the logging indus-
try to pillage our national forests. 

But any such argument in favor 
of excessively thick, dense forest is 
contradictory to American forest 
history. Indeed, many scientists 
have theorized that there are cur-
rently more trees in North 
America than there were when 
Columbus landed. 

"Due to decades of mismanage-
ment, the thinning of these forests 
remains largely unpracticed within 
our state, leaving foresG that his-
torically contained just 30 to 40 
trees per acre now filled with 300 
to 400 trees per acre," Rep.John T. 
Doolittle (R-Calif.) wrote in 
NatilJTUll Rroitw Online on Oct. 31 . 

Forest science professor Tom 
Bonnicksen at Texas A&M 
University also agrees that a 
thinned forest is a more natural 
forest. 

"Unlike the popular idealized 
image of historic forests , which 
depicts old trees spread like a 
blanket over the landscape, a real 
historic forest was pa tchy, n 
Bonnicksen told the San Diego 
Union-Tn/nm( in August 2002. 

A month later, he again told 
the Union-Tribun(, "There's only 
one way to break this cycle of 
monster fires, and that's to go in 
and restore our forests to some-
thing like they were historically." 

And increases in fires since the 
1980s clearly show that it is pre-
cisely environmental regulation 
that is to blame. 

"Up until the 1980s, some of 
the national forests in San 
Bernardino County were corruner-
cially logged," the Sacrammfo Bee 
reported last week. Because of envi-
ronmental policies since then that 
have declared the lands off limits, 
they are perfect fuel for raging fires. 

Not only is the plan good for-
est policy, but it is good econom-
ic policy as well . 

By heeding the calls of environ-
mentalists and excessively protect-
ing our forests, the result is that 
"American taxpayers spent over 
$1.6 billion nastyear in California) 
fighting record-setting blaze due 
to overgrown forests," wrote 
Doolittle. 

In addition to the possibility of 
saving a big chunk of the $1 .6 bil-
lion spent fighting forest fires last 
year in California alone, the modi-
fied Bush plan also takes advantage 
of using logging to thin the forests 
to pay for parts of the plan itself. 

Republican Sen. Pete 
Domenici of New Mexico 
answers the cri tics. 

"For those who have been so 
worried that we 're going to log 
the forests to death, they have 
watched them burn to death," 
Domenici told Associated Press. 
"It's high time we fix it ." 

And while thinning may do 
little to prevent the types of fires 
we witnessed within the city lim-
its of San Diego, Feinstei n's plan 
addresses that concern by ear-
marlcing half of the funds for 
community areas, the rest to be 
used for at-risk thinning projects. 

All in all, the plan will save 
our forests and save our commu-
nities, all while saving taxpayer 
money that has gone up in 
smoke.

~ I LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Chancellor bungled 
and lied during fire 

Editor: 
Dear Acting Chancellor 

Marsha Chandler: 
Thank you for your utter lack of 

leader hip during the firestorm 
emergency. Keeping us mi si n-
formed will surely score you big 
points with the UC Regents as they 
con ider you for the permanent 
posi tion o f chancellor. 

First of all, thank you for not 
e-mailing us about school clo-
sures . Using word-of-mouth 
instead of the e-mail announce-
ment sys tem was fun, under-
ground, and was definitely think-
ing outside the box. I'm glad you 
resisted the temptation to spam 
our inboxes with school closure 
notices, and that you saved cam-
pu wide e-mail for important 
things like introduci ng yourself as 
you did last week. 

Also, thank you for being so 
last-minute. Being the last school 
to decide to close, and then wait-
ing until the late afternoon each 
day to make the next decision kept 
us on our toes. A lot of us had 
midterms scheduled for the week, 
and waiting until the last minute 
helped us study in advance for can-
celled tests. 

Most of all, thanks for your 
misinformation. Being lied to 
abou t the lack of smoke danger 
helped me stay ca lm . My favorite 
quote is from your vice chance ll ors 
who were gooJ enough to at least 
post some notices on UC D Web 
sites. Their sole purported rea o n-
ing for closing schoo l read : "We 
are taking this action as we feel it is 
important to reduce traffic on 
regional highways in support of 
emergency personnel." 

Your concern for the heroic 
emergency personnel is heart-
warming, but, oh yeah, these cam-

" Using word~ofmouth 
instead of the e~mail 

announcement system 
was fun, underground, 

and was definetly thinking 
outside the box. /I

Malaysian PM is 
misunderstood 

E ditor: 
I do not believe that Brian Uiga 

in his article, "The call for a cru-
sade leads to a dangerous societal 
si tuation", rea lly understood 
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahatir 
Mohamad's speech. 

But I do not blame him. For 
many of us, the Holocaust evokes, 
as it should, a strong reflexive emo-
tional reaction to its evil - a reac-
tion perfectly e emplified by 
Uiga's article. But we cannot allow 
these emoti ons to cloud our pre-
sent perception, and it is this prin-
ciple that illuminates Mahatir's 
speech. Indeed he says in the same 
speech, "Angry people cannot 
think properly," and "It is surely 
time that we pause to think .. . 
pausing and thinking calmly is not 
a waste of time." 

So let us stop and examine what 
this advocate of intellect over emo-
tion has sa id regarding the 
Holocaust. 

Referring first to Muslims he 
says, "1.3 billion people cannot be 
wiped out. The Europeans lcilled 
six million Jews out of 12 million. 
But today the Jews rule this world 
by proxy. They get others to fight 
and die for them."

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Letters: Mahatir promoted Jews as an example 
continlled from page 7 

Iga did, that Mahatir holds, and I 
quote Uiga, that "despite Hitler's 
best efforts, Jew till hold too 
much power," or we can interpret 
Ius tatement as promoting the 
example of Jews a a model for 
Muslim to achieve a greater bal-
ance of power in the international 
arena. 

To aid us in under tanding 
which of these interpretations is 
correct and more refleclive of 
Mahatir 's intent, let us look to the 
words he spoke next: "We may 
not be able to do that [get other 
to die and fight for Muslims] . We 
may not be able to unite all the 
1.3 billion Muslims. We may not 
be able to get all the Mu lim gov-
ernments to act in concen. But 
even if we can get a third of the 
Ummah [the Muslim communi-
ty/nation] and a third of the 
Muslim state to act together, we 
can already do omethmg." Do 
what: "'hat is this" omething'" 

Again, ,\1ahatlr ays, "\\'e must 
build up our strength m e\'ery 
field, not just in armed might. Our 
counmc, mu t be stable and well-
admll1lstered, mu t be economi-
cally Jnd finanCIally strong, mdus-
mally competent and technologi-
callv advanced. This will take 

tlm~, but it can be done and It Will 
be time well spent. \\'e are 
enjOined by our religion to be 

patient. In Allah rna as Sabirin 
[ urely, God/Allah i with tho e 
who are patient/the patient 
ones]." Does this sound like a call 
leading toward stable societies or 
away from them to a "dangerous 
societal ituation?" 

But yes, one of the goals of 

" For the record tlwugh, I 
am a uccubus. 

- Bryan Barton, John Muir 
College senior 

Mahatir's drive for Muslims to do 
"omething" involve liberating 
Palestinians from their current 
oppression. However, he is careful 
to note, "Even among the Jew, 
there are many who do not approve 
of what the Israelis are dOlllg." 

If the process of libcrating a 
peoplc from oppression i a cru-
sade, If bCll1g calm when ur-
rounded bl' chao I a cru ade, if 
pausing to' think while others are 
acting on emotion i a crusade, if 
call1l1g for peace and unity and 
equal justice is a crusade then yes, 
Prime Mini ter Mahatir 
Mohamad is on a cru ade, and yes, 

he is calling on Mu lim nations to 
join his cru ade, and yes, those 
who are committing injustice and 
oppression should rightly fear and 
tremble at the coming of this cru-
sade, for in the history of man, 
truth has always triumphed over 
fal ehood, justice over injustice, 
and freedom over tyranny.

boxing remate"? 

Editor: 
In Brian Uiga's, "The Call for a 

Crusade" article, he called me 
both: a "local Succubus" and 
"sniveling." After grabbing a dic-
tionary and looking up "local," I 
have determined that this was 
indeed an insult to my honor. 

Therefore, I challenge this 
boorish lime man to another box-
ing duel at Price Center; then we 
shall ee who is niveling. 

Also let it be remembered that 
I wa not the only "Brian" running 
for A. . president that made refer-
ence to "thc Big Guy." 

For dle record though, I am a 
uccubus.

Ravin': Disillusioned by 
"tradition of no tradition" 

continued from page 5 
innovation and imagination and so 
fonh, it 's horrible for teenagers 
looking for familiarity or cama-
raderie to offset the loneliness they 
inevitably incur the first year. 
Disillusion them then, and it gets 
increasingly harder to win under-
graduates back with time. 

So if these students are unable 
to connect with their university, 
why did they, by and large, not 
care? Did they hate UCSD so 
much that they would rather sit at 
home while their fellow Tritons in 
Scripps Ranch and TIerrasanta saw 
thei r homes burned to a crisp? 
Again, I am well aware of the out-
pouring of aid and service that 
came from the UC D campus, but 
participants of tllese programs are 
the same faces we see carrying the 
campus community every day -
student orgs, members of the AS. 
Council and even (gulp) the 
Greeks. But it's disappointing when 
I couldn't avoid hearing about how 
every ew Yorker pitched to get 
people back on their feet after 9/11 
or how people - burns and stock-
brokers alike - worked together to 
get out of trapped subway and ele-
vator cars. Do ew Yorkers innate-
ly have lions' hearts, or was it OK 
for an acquaintance of mine to ask 
me if the damp weather on Oct. 28 
was going to "screw us" Out of 
another day off because it improved 
firefighting conditions' 

oOOdy's complaining about a 
day or three off. r tried co make the 
best of a horrible ituation by try-
ing to relax over the span, but it's a 
bit outrageous to think you're get-
ting screwed when headway i 
being made in combating a fire 
that killed more than a dozen and 
leveled thousands of homes. 

Many like myself decided to 
lend a helping hand in the situation 
- when I called the Red Cross, 
volunteer orientations were 
booked solid until Nov. 3, a sign 
that many in tllC community were 
concerned - so some colleagues 
and I went to Mira Mesa High 
School to load trucks with food 
and ice. Besides the site coordina-
tor being an egomaniac and clo et 
date rapist, the fact that that I 
puked while dumping out coolers 
full of spoiled tuna sandwiches, and 
being accosted by obnoxiou Red 
Bull cheerleadcrs who, I supposc, 
wanted everyone to know what the 
official energy drink of Firestorm 
2003 was, I fe l t proud that I was 
contributing in some capacity. 

For wanting to include things 
like civic leadership as an admissions 
factor in comprehensive review, why 
hasn't a community service require-
ment been implemented on a large 
cale at University of alifornia a it 

is at many East Coast institutions. If 
we're to be accepted at this presti-
gious university ba ed on things out-
ide of immediate academic qualifi -

cations, why can't we be assessed by 
the same token' Also, requiring stu-
dents to become civic minded for a 
period of time, albeit ~mall, may 
encourage them to look beyond 
their own individual interests and to 
be desirous of a community they can 
take pride in . Perhaps we'd ee a rise 
in involvement in the student body 
if this was a gT'Jduation requirement, 
and maybe the attitudes of indiffer-
ence among our peers w uld not be 
so a bWldant.

THE U D GUARDIAN MONDAY, NOVEMBER 3,2003 

Fire: UCSD experts examine fire control 
contin wed from page I 

vented by road closures and flight 
cancellations, decided to go home. 

"I was kind of down," Muir 
College freshman Rachel Oacha 
said. "It felt like we were trapped 
here." 

The fires directly affected mem-
bers of the UCSD community that 
were evacuated from threatened 
areas and have now returned to 
find their homes un camed, dam-
aged or destroyed. 

o numbers are yet available as 
to how many students, staff and fac-
ulty were directly affected, but a 
campus hodine has been established 
by the Quality of WorklLife office 
to help find temporary places to 
tay for those affected by the fires. 

Those looking either to provide a 
space in their own homes or to find 
a place to stay can call (858) 534-
4214 or e-mail gethelp@ucsd.edu. 

Some students living off-cam-
pus that were evacuated felt lucky 
to find their homes standing upon 
their return. 

"We were so lucky," said Muir 
College junior Chuck LaVerdiere, 
who, along with his housemate, 
was forced to evacuate their house 
in lierrasanta. "When we came 

back we saw the area was literally 
burned up right to our neighbor-
hood." 

La Verdiere said he had time to 
pack valuables and items such as his 
guitar, surfboard and scho lwork 
before he drove to a friend's house, 
where he stayed until his neighbor-
hood was deemed safe. 

"J didn't know I could pack up 
so much stuff so quickly," he said. 
"But I didn't think we were in that 
much danger. You never think this 
could happen to me.'" 

After the fire were contained, 
Tterrasanta was reopened to resi-
dents, who found some of the 
neighborhoods ravaged. 

"We watched the news all day to 
see whether our house was still 
there or not, seeing street si gn on 
the screen with flames behind them 
and hoping we wouldn't see ours," 
LaVerdiere aid. 

Faculty and staff experienced 
similar evacuations throughout the 
county. Richard Carson, chair of 
the Economics Department, was 
evacuated from his home in Scripps 
Ranch. He found his home intact 
upon his return, unlike many of the 
homes in the badly burned Scripps 
Ranch area. 

"It was bad to see a whole line of 
houses serve as a fire break, but 
after they did that, the firefighters 
made a valiant effort to protect the 
houses behind them," Carson said. 
"Given the equipment they had, 
they did a bang-up job fighting the 
fires. " 

Carson, along with many other 
UCSD faculty expert, has been 
active in commenting on the fires 
for various news media throughout 
the nation . An expert on wildfires 
and public policy, Carson edi ted 
the book "Both Sides of the 
Border," which took a look at fire 
policies in Southern California and 
on the other side of the border in 
Baja California, where there is little 
fire control. 

"In Southern California they 
try to suppress fires right away, 
and because of that, when it gets 
away from them, there are no nat-
ural fire breaks," Car on said. "All 
the small fires in Baja Stop other 
fires from getting through . ~o in 
fact what happens is that we make 
these giant fires much more like-
ly." 

Carson also criticized the

cated to his students and deeply 
focused on the univer i ry's academ-
ic program. His death is a great loss 
to the university and to me person-
ally." 

UC Regent Peter Preuss shared 
tkinson's sentiments. 

"Pat Ledden spent over 30 years 
relentlessly making the university 
what it is today, while at the same 
time leaving belund 0 many friends 

in the community," Preuss said. 
Because he played sueh an active 

role in the student life on c;tmpus, 
Ledden will be deeply missed by 
his students as well a his col-
leagues. 

"He lit up the room with his 
presence becau e he just had this 
charm about him," John Muir 
College sophomore hari Soli said. 
"When I was sti ll deciding whether 
to attend UCSD or not in April 

2001, Provost Ledden gave this 
speech t11at was so touching. He 
had this wit that was so funny yet so 
endearing. I wanted to go to this 
school that this man was so pas-
ionate for. He embodied the Muir 
pirit. [1 Ie was] a truly amazing 

man. He will be deeply missed .~'

Strike: Groceries call union 
move 'strategy to divide' 

continued from page I 
union has decided to concentrate 
its protest against A1bertsons and 
Vons, which the union says have 
been the most uncompromising in 
negotiations. 

'Ralphs, from our standpoint, 
has not taken a hard line in the 
negouation , and if we were sItting 
down with Ralphs individually, and 
they weren't part of this pact, then 
in my opinion we wouldn't have a 
strike," aid Rick leaza, president of 
Los Angeles-based Local 770, the 
largest of the seven locals involved. 

Though he encouraged cus-
tomers to continue to avoid all 
three chains in negotiations. Icaza 
explained that the union hopcd to 
bring relief to consumer over-
whelmed by raging wildfi res and a 
concurrent tran portation strike in 
Los Angeles. 

"In light of the challenge, espe-
cially the devastating fires in 

outhern California, we would like 
to do everything to make lives eas-
ier for consumers," he said. "\ Ve 
really wam to thank the consumers 
for respecting our picket lines. \Ne 
want to give them an alternative." 

At the same time, union officials 
admitted that the move represented 
a divi ive trategy shift, meam to 
create a rift between the three com-
panies that said they would negoti-
ate as a single bargaining uni t. 

"The union's strategy to divide 
the companies will fail. The 
employer remain united in our 
belief that we have made a very 
good contract offer," the three gro-
cer stated in an Oct. 31 joint press 
relea e. "The companies and the 
union agreed at the beginning of 
negotiations that a strike against one 
is a strike against all. The union 's 
action today changes nothing." 

The companies have een their 
sales plummet by 75 percent since 
Oct. II , when 70,000 union mem-
bers walked off their jobs after the 
breakdown of contract negotia-
tions, with Vons alone losing $150 
million, leaza said. 

The original strike targeted 
only Vons. accusIng its parent 
company Safeway of being the 
primary author of dra tIC benefits 
cuts in offered proposals and cor-
porate mismanagement. After th e 
lI1itial announcement o( the 
strike. both AJbertsons and Ralph 
locked Out their employees. sa}'-
ing that a strike against one com-
pany constituted a strike agall1st 
all three. 

Both sides agreed that higher 
medical co-payments and the 
introduction of a monthly premi -
um for health coverage represented 
the biggest obstacles in reaching a 
compromise on a new contract. 

Labor leaders from across the 
country have called the dIspute a 
banlefield (or the futu re of health 
benefits for all workers and began a 
national "Ilold the Li ne fo r [Iealth 
Care Fund" to uppon striking 
employees. UFc\V, which pays 
striking employees up to $300 per 
week, currently has enough funds 
to sustain the work stoppage 
through May. Icaza said . 

In addiuon to bulking up lines 
at Yons and Albertson store. for-
mer Ralphs picketer will also sur-
round warehouses of the twO com-
panies. \ Yith suppOrt of the 
Team ters Union, which represents 
truck drivers and has honored 
UFC\V picket lines, the mo\'e is 
meant to effecu\'elv hut down the 
distribution centers. 

The grocers argued that the 
decision to abandon Ralph was a 
defensive one. 

"By announci ng it was taking 
down its pickct line~ at Ralphs 
stOres, the United Food and 
Commercial \ Yorkers union 
acknowledged what the grocery 
companies already know - there is 
weakening uppOrt from employees 
and cu tomers for the strike," their 
statement said. 

John luir College senior 
Michelle Vavra, who has worked as 
a temporary replacement worker at 
an A1bertsons in Santee, said that 
the store is doing betrer as the 
strike drags out. 

"We have more people coming 
in," Vavra said. "I hear people say-
ing they can't keep spending the 
amount of money they've been 
paying at other stores." 

For Vavra, the labor di pute has 
literally divided her fam ily, with 
her mother among the unionized 
triking worker and her father a 

non-union AJbcrtsons manager. 
"I fully uppon what my mom is 

doing. but my dad is tOtally stressed

continued from fXJ«t 3 
ed for about 554 million, for an 
average of 52,823 per student, 
compared to a national average of 
52,400. 

"According to a [UC Board of] 
Regents regulation, a third of all 
fees goes toward financial aid pro-
grams for the low-income stu-
ilents," De Anda said. "For the 
most part, the budget crisis hasn't 
affected financial aid negatively 
because the fees went up. With 
fees going up, we've been able to 
return financial aid to the pro-
gram. So, from 
that point of view, 
it didn't hurt 
financial aid. 

" 

pretty well covered as fees go up," 
De Anda said. "The problem is 
middle-income students or upper-
middle-income students who have 
no way of paying other than out of 
their pocket." 

Sixth College freshman Russell 
Peavy said he falls into this catego-
ry. 

"I feel left behind by the finan-
cial aid program and upset that 
hardworking middle-class families 
don't get any support," Peavy said. 

The College Board study also 
found that for low-income stu-

dents, college fees

percent of household 

[However), it's

According to

Reactions: Health issues forced closure 
continued from page 10 

response during the current 
Southern California fires . 

"You have an inherent struc-
tural problem," he said. "The 
way firefighting worles is you 
have to pull your local level 
resources first, then state-level 
resources, but because of the 
other fires [in the Los Angeles 
area] there wasn't any other state 
resources, so the only other 
option was federal." 

Steven Buckley, a professor of 
mechanical aerospace and engi-
neering' addressed the idea of 
controlled burns to prevent such 
giant fires. 

"It's a little bit risky, but 
would serve to eliminate some of 
the underbrush that serves to 
fuel the fire," Buckley said. 

The question of preventive 
controlled burns has been dis-
cussed widely following the 
spread of the fires in Southern 
California, and Buckley felt that 
it would "bring up all sorts of 
questions about what's appropri -
ate." 

" In the U .S .... we try to tailor 
the environment to our liking, 
and tend to think we can control 
everything, until we realize there 
are some things we just can't," 
said Buckley. "We have to look to 
our approach - do we assume 
that no fire is good? My guess is 
that we're going to move toward 
more controlled burns, and 
unfortunately it might take 
omething of that magnitude to 

spur that." 
Other UCSD experts com-

mented on the effects of the fire 
smoke and the particulate matter 

in the air following the fires . 
"[Unhealthy air quality) 

brings about two health issues: 
respiratory, like asthma and 
bronchitis and problems with 
children and the elderly, and car-
diovascular, because people have 
heart stress when they can't 
breathe well," said Mark 
Thiemens, dean of UCSD's 
Physical Sciences Division. "It's 
probably not going to make the 
healthy person sick, as your lungs 
purge out with time and the air 
clears, but the best thing to do 
was to get out of town." 

Many students on campus 
experienced such short-term 
effects as headache, nausea, 
dizziness and chest discomfort, 
according to Brad Buchman, 
clinical director of Student 
Health Services. 

."The campus closure was 
mediated initially by concerns 
for keeping freeways open but it 
became apparent that the key 
issue was air quality," Buchman 
said. " We felt that it was so bad 
that students should stay 
inside." 

While a higher-than-usual 
number of students came in with 
asthma and other respiratory 
problems, Buchman said that the 
cases were not overwhelming. 

"We were gearing up to see 
lots and lots of students with 
horrible symptoms, but fortu-
nately that didn't happen," he 
said. 

While many students were 
seen walking around campus 
with masks on the days the cam-
pus was closed, Student Health 
Services did not recommend 

their use as they were not protec-
tive enough in the bad air and 
gave students a sense of "false 
security," according to the SHS 
Web site. 

Campus concern for stu-
dents and staff revolved not 
only around physical health, but 
also mental health. Counseling 
services have been made avail-
able for all individuals of the 
UCSD community affected by 
the fires. 

"Typically after a crisis like 
this, people are oriented toward 
managing the practical impacts, 
and then the emotional impacts 
will surface in the next days or 
weeles," said Robert Mashman, 
clinical director of Psychological 
Counseling and Services. "We 
are encouraging people to call in, 
and have the capacity to come 
out and meet with groups of Stu-
dents." 

A psychologist is on call every 
day and available free of charge 
both in person or by phone by 
calling (858) 534-3755. 

As the campus recovers from 
the effects of the fire, academics 
have also been impacted for 
most students as professors 
were forced to push ba ck 
lessons, assignments and 
midterms. 

" ow it's either the profes-
sors have to go ahead faster with 
the ma terial or leave it up to us 
to learn, so it's just stressfu l," 
Oacha said. 

With all campus services back 
to regular operation, the cam-
pus has resumed its daily routine . 

"It should be just business a 
usual from now on,"Jenkin said.

I FACES AT UCSD 
Humble ledurer imparts lessons ' in Deaf culture 
Tom Humphries teaches his class "The Power _of Voice" in ASL 

By BAlli WOITH 
Associate Features Editor 

Tom Humphries is a lecturer of 
communication and in the 
Teacher Education Program at 
UCSD. but he is not just a typical 
lecturer. Being deaf is a quality 
that distinguishes him from oth-
ers. and as a deaf lecturer. his 
teaching experiences and those he 
provides for his tudents are 
somewhat unique. 

Humphries was not born deaf. 
or even into a deaf family. His hear-
ing declined around age six. and in 
his teens. he referred to his condi-
tion as "hard of hearing," a term 
which implies that an individual 
can still hear some sounds and is 
not completely deaf. 

Gro\\~ng uP. he came to realize 
the full measure of his hearing loss 
and simultaneously adopted a very 
optimistic perspective. 

He tells his students that just 
because he belongs to a community 
that can't hear doesn't mean he 
considers himself disabled in the 
least. In fact. much of what he 
teaches in his classes deals with the 
idea that although hearing people 
may always see deaf people as dif-
ferent from themselves in a catego-
ry labeled as "other." deaf people 
have a communjty and culture of 
their own and see themselves as 
fully capable human beings. By not 
comparing them elves to hearing 
people. they are careful not to fur-
ther the dominant beliefs that they 
are inferior in any way to the hear-
Ing culture. According to 
Humphries. then. deaf people are 
not lacking and incomplete; in tead 

they are simply an entirely separate 
culture that is not always under-
stood by the hearing community. 

Humphries is a self-proclaimed 
laid-back guy who grew up in a 
small town in South Carolina and 
anended a local public school. As a 
youngster. he was surrounded by 
hearing folks . 

"1 did not even meet other deaf 
people until 1 entered Gallaudet 
University. a college for deaf stu-
dents in Wa hingron. D.C .... he 
said. 

In his teenage years. he would 
work during summers for his uncle. 
who was a certified public accoun-
tant. in an effort to raise money for 
college. But when Humphries got 
to college. he changed the direction 
of his scope of study. He realized 
that his true passion was to study 
English. 

"I always loved to read. 1 was 
one of those who could never read 
enough." he said. "And at that time 
there was no Amawn.com. and the 
drug stores were the only places 
you could buy books. They never 
had much of a selection. so 1 spent 
twelve years in the library." 

He went on to embrace his love 
for language. majoring in English 
education at Gallaudet University 
and continuing there. teaching in 
the english department. 

Humphries moved to San 
Diego in 197 and began hj teach-
ing career at UCSD in 1991. He 
has since made a livelihood from 
his fascination for the English lan-
guage by teaching college-level 
commurucation classes. and is also 
the associate director of the 
Teacher Education Program at

UCSD. 
How does a deaf man lecture to 

a Center Hall-sized class about 
communication. when he cannot 
communicllte in standard English 
and most of his students are not 
versed in sign language? 

His classes operate essentially 
like any other with one distinct dif-
ference - Humphries lectures in 
American Sign Language with the 
help of one or two interpreters. 
Mala Kleinfeld and Bonnie 
Sherwood. 

"You'lI get used to this really 
quickly," he assured his students on 
the first day of class. when. to the 
shock of many students. a woman's 
voice spoke to them on behalf of 
Humphries. who enthusiastically 
draws visual aids on the board dur-
ing most of his lectures. 

Students seem to agree that this 
teaching method is different but 
engaging. 

"I think it's very interesting. 
considering I've never had a pro-
fessor who was deaf before. 1 feel 
more appreciative for the culture 
now," said Sindy Block. a 
Thurgood Marshall College 
senior in Humphries' communi-
cation class. which is appropriate-
ly ti tied "The Power of Voice. " 

Humphries explains that ASL is 
an official language. just like any 
spoken language. bound by culture 
and rich in meaning. 

"ASL is more than mere ges-
rures." he teaches his srudents. 

Humphries believes that being a 
member of the deaf community has 
certamly helped to shape hi life 
experiences and career paths. 

"1 realized early on that there is 

T~ tVI/Guarcion 
Sips of the times: Tom Humphries lectures to his communication dass in 
American Sign Language as an interpreter speaks on his behalf. 
so much to learn from ASL and 
communication in the deaf com-
munity. and that tells us a lot about 
the capacity of sign language and 
the ca pacity of culture." 
Humphries said. 

He emphasizes that his research 
in the field of language in the deaf 
community translates to universal 
lessons about communication that 
apply to anyone. 

" I am interested in language and 
language use. and how communica-
tion works through that process." 
Humphries explained. "I'm not 
talking about only my lab in the 
deaf community. but this is a really 
interesting. broad question." 

While his academic research is 
important to him. Humphries says 
his greatest accomplishments were 
no-brainers. 

"I don't know whether to say 
[my greatest accomplishment was) 
my daughter or my loving rela -
tjonship with my wife." he said. "I 
guess I would have to say my 
greatest accomplishment i my 
family." 

Where his professional life is 
concerned. however. Humphries 
points to the work he's done withjn 
the deaf conununity. 

"My whole career has been

certain body shape. After reading 
the play "Hedda Gabler" by 
Henrik Ibsen. Foerster created a

Hllrd lit work: Although these spaces may start to feel like home. first-year 
graduate student Danny Jauregui uses his studio as a work space for his art 

formance 3rt." 
Besides participating in gallery 

shows like the one titled "The 
Conditional Cake Show." which 
was compiled by everal fellow 
graduate students, Winter has 
booked shows that have a perfor-
mance art basis. such as one that 
was themed "technologically 
enhanced performance art." 

According to Barclay. the perfor-
mance art program in UCSD' visu-
al arts department is ranked third in 
the nation by Newsweek magazine 
and was derived from the 
"Happenjngs" movement in New 
York City. Different from perform-
ing arts (theatre and dance). perfor-
mance art is a separate mode of wha t 
Barclay called "a new wave of art." 

"Performance art was founded 
in the 19605. and UCSD was 
among the first. foremost programs 
in performance art," Barclay said. 
"We were on the cutting edge. and 
still are." 

Instead of art displayed in the 
typical media of canvas. clay. film 
or photo paper. performance art is 
art in its active form; art as it hap-
pens in everyday life. 

"It consists of imagery and poet-
ry," Barclay said. "It's a kind of art 
that deals with a lot of social issues

ideas." 

Aside from the studio that is 
designated for each graduate stu-
dent. there is also an area for per-
formance art called the 
"Performance Space." 

Those who actively create per-
formance art will not use an area 
that resembles a stage too closely 
but will instead use a space that has 
a more natural or realistic setting_ 

"Performance art as a medium 
isn't particularly routed for a spe-
cific space." Winter sa id. 

In general. the students express 
their appreciation for their studio 
space. Each individual door reflects 
the vitality that emanates from the 
facility and all of the creative work 
that is born within the studios. 

"I love it. its the best. I feel real

The Seagull 
Mandell Weiss 

Forum, Bpm 
Presented by UCSD 
Theatre and Dance 

• ANTON CHEKHOV had writ-
ten a few full length plays 
before, but THE SEAGULL (as 
performed by the Moscow Art 
T heater in 1897) was his first 
overwhe lming success. 

o When a Chekhov produc-
tion is great, inconsequential 

detai ls seems luminous. He is the master of minor details-
noises, idle chatter-and a production captures his genius when 
it shows us how people do (or don't) respond to these details. 
o Konstantin Stan islavski, director at the Moscow Art Theater, 
wrote a num ber of books on acting, the first of w hich, AN 
ACTOR PREPARES , was published in E nglish tran lation in 1936. 
H e influenced Lee Strasberg (founder of the Actor's Studio) 
and the develo pment of " method" acting. The Seagull was the 
first play Stanislawski employed in order to put his theory of 
realism in actin g into practice.

continued from page :2 7 
from about 30 yards out and 
clanked it off the crossbar with 10 
minutes left. 

"We did enough to win," 
Armstrong said. "We just didn't 
execute on our scoring chances." 

Throughout the game, UCSD 
missed the leadership of injured 
defenders junior Luke Russell and 
senior Ryan Blair. The Tritons 
allowed 12 shots and Cookson was 
forced to make four saves. 

On Senior Night, the Tritons 
bid a farewell to six players, includ-
ing Blair, Cookson, mid fielder 
Ryan Mizumoto, Shum and A1exi 
Tello. Although the night is sup-
posed to be memorable for the 
players who might be malcing their 
final appearance at home, it may 
have taken some of the attention 
away from what the Tritons really 
wanted to do - clinch the CCM 
South title. 

"I hope it didn't affect u on the 
fie ld, bur we might have lost some 
of ollr focus tonight," Armstrong 
aid. 

The Tritons have clinched at 
least a wild card berth in the CCAA

were junior Jan Godoslci and

golfers finished in a tie for 41 t 
place, posting scores of 225, 12 
over par. 

Codoslci turned in rounds of 7 1, 
78 and 76, while Kramer had 
scores of 79, 73 and 73. 

" \. e were a little put off by 
this tOurnament. We didn 't have 
our str ngest squad out there, and 
it wa n 't our best showing," 
Wydra said . "However, we ' re 
looking forward to the meat of 
our ea on, which begins in 
Februa ry, and between now and 
then we'll be making a lot of 
changes, from equipment to tech-
nique, and we'll be putting in a lot 
of practice." 

Rounding out the rest of the 
score at the tournament, Cal 

tatc San Marco came out in 
fourth place, shooting 863 over 
the two days, to finish II over par. 
Cal tate Monterey Bay took fifth 
place, with a total of 872. Cal 
State Stanislaus came next, in 
sixth, with a three-round total of 
877.

Although UCSD is guaranteed 
to play in one of the serrufinal 
games this upcoming weekend, it 
wants to wrap up the d ivision with 
a win against Cal State San 
Bernardino on Nov. 3. 

"This game [against Grand 
Canyon] was a major hiccup," 
Armstrong said. "Now we just have 
to go up to San Bernardino and 
take care of it there."

"r told them [at ha lftime] not 
to go out loolcing to score, but 
JUSt to play," head coach Brian 
McManus said . Evidently, "just 
playing" to the Tritons meant 
putting five more goals past the 
Grand Canyon goalie. Freshman 
Megan Dickey got on the board , 
Treankler added her second of 
the game and sophomore 
Kristina De La Rosa collected 
her second of the season. With a 
more-than-comfortable lead, 
McManus could afford a few lux-
uries, like putting junior goalie 
Jamie Lautenschleger in to play 
the field. 

"She asked me if I needed her 
to play on the field in the second 
half," McManus said. "She plays 
on the field in practice, so I put 
her in." Lautenschleger didn't 
disappoint, as she headed home a 
goal in the 76th minute. 

Senior defender Christine 
Wensel, known better as an 
offensive contributor that plays 
balls into the middle of the box 
for teammates, found herself on 
the left side of the score sheet for 
the first time this season. She let 
lose a rocket from distance that 
got over the keeper and grazed 

Also scoring were seniors 
Conahan, Jones, Mendoza and 
Wensel. Molly Carlson, Sarah 
Schopbach and Amy Goker 
stepped up the defense to ensure 
the shutout. Keeper Kami Poma, 
playing in her first game back 
from injury, ended the game in 
net. Shannon Harrelson was th e 
only senior that wasn 't on the 
fi eld as the clock ticked down to 
zero. She came down with an ill-
ness and was forced to rruss the 
game. 

Despite the lopsided score, 
McManus was a little unsure of 
the fitness level of his squad after a 
20-day layoff. 

"We were a little slow out 
there," he said. "We need another 
game to get ready for the play-
offs." 

The Tritons hadn't played 
since an Oct. 12 win at Cal State 
Bakersfield . They had a 13 -day 
break on the schedule, but the 
fires in Southern California post-
poned two more games, lengthen-
ing their time without a match to 
20 days. McManus preferred to 
have played a more competitive 

UCSD will make up its OCt. 
25 match against Cal State San 
Bernardin o on Nov. 3. The 
Coyotes must win to clinch 3 
wild card berth. If UCS D wins 
or ties , the Tritons will have to 
play Cal Poly Pomona on ov. 5

THE U 0 GUARDIAN MONDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 2003 

Volleyball: UCSD remains undefeated at home 
contin ued from page :1 8 

10 errors - many of which were 
forced by the Coyote block that 
allowed Cal State San Bernardino 
to grab a 2-1 advantage with a 30-
23 win. 

UCSD did a better job of neu-
tralizing the Coyote block in game 
four and the offen e played nearly 
mistake-free volleyball while 
amassing a .400 attacking percent-
age as the Tritons rolled, 30-24. 
Backup setter Denelle Smalley saw 
orne action as a back row specialist 

for UCSD and helped to stabilize 
her team with consistent defense 
and passing to force a decisive fifth 
game. 

\Vith tensions running high and 
the crowd clamoring for the 
Tritons to rise to the occasion, the 
team felt obliged to come up with 
something special. 

"Ir was fabulou to have such a 
grea t enthusiastic crowd out 
here," McFarland said. "I started 
thinking, 'God, if for no other 
reason we've got to win thi for 
this grea t crowd. We can't disap-
point them.'" 

Disappointment eemed to be 
looming for the Tritons as Cal 

State San Bernardino reeled off 
several key points and held an 11 -8 
lead in the race to 15 before the 
Tritons stormed back. Mter pick-
ing up a sideout on a Wilson kill to 
close the margin to two, Hogan -
the unlikely serving hero -
stepped up and served two aces and 
five straight points to give the 
Tritons three attempts to finish the 
match at 14- 11. UCSD converted 
on the second game point and the 
court was flooded with throngs of 
exuberant fans who flowed out and 
piled onto the players. The atmos-
phere was electric. 

"That was huge," Smalley said. 
" It felt like the national champi -
onship." 

The win avenged the Tritons' 
loss to the Coyotes earlier this year 
in San Bernardino in which a simi -
larly epic battle took place, only 
with a significantly different result. 
When asked later whether or not 
her team entertained thoughts 
about the possibility of falling 
agai n to the Coyotes, Wilson 
responded fi rmly. 

" 0, none," she said. "We knew 
we could do it and we fought and 
we were willing to work hard." 

Wilson led all players with 25 
kills while four of her teammates -
Hogan, Dunsmore, Crandell , and 
middle blocker Kendra Canape -
also put up double-digit kill totals. 
Canape led UCSD with six total 
blocks, Mills had a match-high 24 
digs, and Teresa Ohta dished out 
63 assists on the night. 

The Tritons currently si t in 
second place in CCAA and awai t 
the release of both the regional 
and national rankings due out this 
week. Should UCSD win the rest 
of its conference matches and the 
Coyotes lose at least one, the 
Tritons would grab at least a sha re 
of the CCAA title and have a very 
good chan ce of host ing the West 
Regional, where a rema tch with 
Cal State San Bernardino is likely. 
Should that rematch occu r, 
UCSD believes it has the mental 
edge. 

"They're going to remember 
this o ne and hopefully the play ffs 
will be right here in our gym," 
Smalley said. 

The Tritons continue o n their 
quest toward malcing that dream a 
reality as they host Grand Canyon 
on Nov. 5 for a mid-week bout. 

Polo: Tritons earn top seed in conference 
continued from page :1 

end in which UCSD failed to 
score . 

"W t! were missing opportunities 
that shouldn't have been missed," 
Bor 0 aid. "I think there were four 
one-on-nobody's where our shots 
just missed their mark." 

In the fourth, UCSD was able 
to tie the game at the 5: 16 mark 
on a four-meter penalry shot by 
Hopkins. UC Davis then ran a 
wing-drive and opened up a 
shooter at two-meters, thus being 
able to fire a shot that deflected 
off two of the goal's crossbars 
before coming to rest under 
UCS D goalie Colin McElroy'S 
arm on the goal line. T he front-
court referee did not call the ball a 
goal, and the score remained tied 
until Borso scored with barely two 
minutes remaining on the game 
clock, in what turned out to be the 
game-deciding goal. 

"We expected them to playa 
tough game, but we didn't expect 
it to be that close, " Borso said. 

"It's not that we weren't mentally 
or physically prepared; we JUSt 
didn't finish ." 

This was the first time that UC 
Davis met the Tritons thi season 
and increased UCSD's Western 
Water Polo Association record to 
7 -0, guaranteeing a fir t seed at 
the VVWPA conference tourna-
ment at Redlands later thi s 
month. 

"I t's not a guaran tee," Cooper 
said on the prospect of winning the 
conference. "Teams that we have 
beaten easily in the regular cason 
can step it up in the tournament. 
They know that all they have to do 
is beat us." 

"[Earning a top seed in WWPA] 
is bittersweet," Borso said. "On one 
hand, your team is favored, but on 
the other, all of these teams know 
that we have been the best for two or 
three years, so they kind of know 
what to expect." 

The winner of the WWPA con-
ference tournament is granted a 
seed in the CAA Championship 

in the first weekend of December. 
The Tri tOns improved their 

overall record to 16-8. 
McElroy was credited with 24 

saves at the UC Davis Shoorout, 
and teammate Hopkins was able to 
raise his total number of goals to 52 
on the season for UCSD. 

The next and final Triton home 
game will take place Nov. 7 ve rsu 
UC Santa Barbara at Canyonvicw 
Pool, where there WIll be a beer 
garden.

The Tritons failed to clinch the COO South division title against the Antelopes. 

By ANU KUMAR the South division championship 
Associate Sports Editor on OCt. 25 with a win over Cal 

State San Bernardino, but the 
road game was postponed due to 
the Southern California wild-
fire s. Since the Coyotes knocked 
off Cal Poly Pomona on Nov. I , 
Cal State San Bernardino has 
inched back into the picture . 
T he Tritons will make up the 
game against the Coyotes on 
Nov. 3. A UCSD win will give it 
the division title, but a Cal State 
San Bernardino victory will 
result in a tie between the twO 
teams in the standings . The 
Coyotes would win the tiebreak-
er over the Tritons because they 
have a better record against 
other CCAA South tea ms. 

Needing just one point to 
clinch a second consecutive 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association South division title, 
the UCSD men's soccer team was 
upset 2- 1 by last-place Grand 
Canyon on Senior Night at Triton 
Soccer Stadium. 

After Triton mid fielder Sean 
Summers, who was playing his last 
regular eason game at home , 
scored the first goal of the game 
for UCSD, the Antelopes 
answered with back-to-back goals 
to stun the Tritons and open the 
door for second-place Cal State 
San Bernardino to challenge for 
the division crown . 

CS D could have clinched 
"We s rewed up," UCSD head 

coach Derek Armstrong said. 

"This was an unbelievable screw-
up." 

In the early going, UCSD 
looked like the better team, 
putting pressure on the Antelope 
defense. In the fir tiS minutes of 
the game, the Tritons recorded 
three shots on goa l, a couple of 
them cOIning o n one-on-one itu-
ations with Grand Canyon goal-
keeper Byron Bent. 

UCSD finally put one by Bent 
in the game's 19th minute. UCSD 
freshman lnidfielder Brett Maurer 
took control of the ball at midfield 
and pushed it up past two 
Antelope defenders. H e crossed it 
to Summers, who blasted a shot 
from the left side to give the 
Tritons a 1-0 lead. 

Gra.nd Canyon got the equaliz-
ing goal on a penalty kick at the 
31 :0 1 mark. After the Antelopes 
sent a free kick into the penalty 
box, the ball bounced up and hit 
Triton defender jonathan Shum's 
arm. Grand Canyon rnidfielder 
Ben Scott converted on the conse-
quent penalty kick and tied the 
game going into halftime. 

In the second half, Grand 
Canyon took the lead in the 79 th 
minute when mid fielder Ryan 
Velasquez scored off of a rebound 
on a messy play. Several players 
crowded the box and UCSD goal-
keeper jeremy Cookson couldn't 
get his hands on the ball before it 
got by him. 

The l ritons desperately tried 
to tie the game late in the second 
half, but they came up short on 
the opportunities that they 
earned. Their best chance came 
when Summers took a free kick

The UCSD golf team took 
eighth place in a field of t7 teams 
in the Elco Invitational hosted by 
Cal State Bakersfield at the 
Stockdale Country Club in 
Bakersfield, Calif., on Oct. 27 and 
Oct. 28 

"Stockdale is one of the shortest 
and tightest courses we play all 
yea r," head coach Mike Wydra 
said, " It was built in 1903, and fea-
tures huge narural trees, which is 
where the main difficulty of the 
course comes from." 

T he Tritons had a great early 
round on Oct. 27, finishing with a 
team score of 289, which PUI 
them in sixth place. They came 
back with 
another strong 
pe rforma nce 
in the after-
noon round, 
turning in a 
295 that left 
them in sev-
enth place and 
16 over par. 

Coming 
back for the 
final round on 
OCt. 28, the 
Tritons put in a 
297 team total,

bringing their final, three-round 
total up to 881, giving them an 
eighth-place finish at 29 over par. 

"We were a little disappointed 
because one of our players , 
[juniorl Joe Dolby, was unable to 
be excused from one of his classes 
to participate in the tournament, 
so we didn't have our strongest 
squad out on the course," \lVydra 
said. 

Chico State took an early lead 
in the tournament and never 
looked back. The Wildca ts fin-
ished with a tournament record 
12 - under- par 8-10 . al State 
Bakersfield finished in seco nd 
place with a score of 50. Point 
Lorna Nazarene rounded out the 
top three wi th a score of 859, 
seven over par. 

Individually, UCSD wa led by 
junior Brian Duckworth and senior 
Alan Scheer. Both golfers finished 
wi th a three-round total of 22 2, 
ni ne over par, putting them in a tie 
for 33rd place. 

"Alan went up on the last 
round of the tournament, which is 
something I don't think you'll see 
happen for the rest of the year," 
Wydra said. "He had a little rrou-
ble with a triple and double con-
secutive bogies in his final round." 

Duckworth and Scheer also 
had even scor es on the ea rly 
round on Oct. 27, with each 
golfer finishing at 71, par for the 
course. Duckworth scored a 75 
and 76 on hi.; next two rounds to 
finish off the tournament, while 
Scheer ga rnered a 72 and a 79 for 
OCt. 28. 

"As a team we played decent, 
though we would've liked to finish 
better," Scheer said. "H o wever, this 
gives us something to build on for 
February. I know we're capable of 
beating the top teams out there ." 

Freshman Nick jones, compet-
ing in his first tournament fo r the 
Tri tons, finished with a score of

UCSD upsets No. 1 CSUSB in a five-game battle 
Women's volleyball wins against Cal Poly Pomona and CSUSB 

By BRYCE WARWICK 
Senior Staff Writer 

There wa no trick, bur the 962 
fans that turned our for the 
Halloween night match between 

o. 4 CSD and top-ranked Cal 
State an Bernardino were treated 
to a cla ic. The mass of brightly 
costumed fans rushing onto the 
court after Bonnie Wilson put 
down her match-high 25th kill on 
the night to finish the 3-2 (2 -30, 
30-21, 13-30, 30-24 and 15-12) 
Triton victory eemed a fitting end 
to the twO hour and 25 minute 
emotional rollercoaster ride. 

Before the Triton could get 
their shot at the Coyotes of Cal 

tate an Bernardino, however, 
the fir t had to play the only team 
to defeat the Coyotes in California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
play thu far this season - the 
Bronco of Cal Poly Pomona. 

C D head coach Duncan 
McFarland keyed the match as crit-
icaJ to his team' ability to recover 
from a tough road trip. 

"I thmk we really had our confi-
dence haken with the 10 e to 
[Cal tate] Bakersfield and [Cal 
State Lo Angeles) and we're trug-
gling to get it back," he said. 

V\'ith a revamped lineup that 
featured Lauren Mills at libero and 
Lind ay Crandell at oppo ite, the 
Tritons were able to charge out to a 
quick 30-21 victory in game one. 
Cal Pol v Pomona held a three-
point le~d early in the match, but 

solid hitting that produced 19 kills 
and ju t three errors along with 
middle blocker Katie Hogan'S 
three solo blocks pushed UC D on 
to the win . 

Game two saw the Tritons 
streak out to a 9-2 lead and never 
look back as they took their econd 
consecutive 30-21 decision. The 
going was not as ea y in game 
three, however, as are-energized 
Bronco quad took a five-point 
lead at 16-11 and threatened to 
push the match to a fourth game. 
The Triton stayed with the 
Bronco to the end with Wilson 
bringing it back level at 29. With 
the tension building, Ohta hit a 
soft, low serve toward the frOnt 
right corner of the court that hit 
the tOP of the net, teetered danger-
ously backward, and then dropped 
on the other side for an ace that 
gave the Tritons a 30-29 lead. 
They clo ed the match on the next 
play. 

Mills picked up a match-high 
17 digs for UC D while Ohta 
added 12 to go with her 44 assists. 

UCSD turned around the next 
night to face the top team in both 
the nation and the CCAA with a 
chance to close the two-game lead 
the Coyotes held over the Tritons 
going into the match. For many of 
the players, however, the Oct. 31 
match was about more than just a 
game in the standings. 

Ult's just the pride," aid 1ills. 
"When they win, they wear it well 
and they show it off, and 0 we'd 

like to wear it this year." 
In game one, UCSD looked 

poi ed to take control of the match 
early with a 6-2 run, but from there 
forward it wa back and forth . After 
Cal State San Bernardino closed to 
within rwo points at 14-12, the 
Tritons went on an -3 run to open 
up a seven-point lead at 22- 15. 
They retained that margin at 27-20 
and seemed to be on the brink of 
taking the first game before UCSD 
suffered a breakdown, allowing the 
Coyotes to take 10 of the next 11 
points and game one by a 30-28 
score. 

"We might have gotten sort of 
complacent, and we knew we had a 
lead," Wilson said. 

The Tritons came back trong 
in game rwo. Five straight service 
points by Dunsmore midway 
through gave UCSD the cushion it 
needed to grab a 30-22 win and to 
even the match. 

McFarland was impres ed with 
his team's resiliency. 

"Losing that first game with 
such a big lead was really a hard 
thing to come back from when you 
know you've had a great opporru-
nity you've let slip away," he aid. 
UI thought they showed really good 
character to fight back from that in 
the second game." 

The Triton were in need of 
that resiliency once again after the 
offense sputtered in game three, 
producing 15 kills and continuing

The sixth-ranked Triton men's

overwhelmed o. 17 anta lara 
11-4, before edging out No. 16 
U DavIS, 7-6. 

On the opening day of the 
tournament, the Triton defense 
was nearly II1vinclble. In th tour-
nament -opener agall1 t Brown, 
U [) came out strong and 
ba ked the Bears i 010 a 5 -0 hoI 111 

the first quarter, crushmg their 
morale. While Brown was able to 
hold UCSD to one goal in the 
second quarter, the damage would 
stick as the Tritons won the third 
quarter 3-2 and held on for a shut 
out in the fourth, 3-0, rounding 
out the 12-3 rout. 

That afternoon, UCSD took 
on the Banana lugs with seem-
ingly little effort. Following a 
clo e 2-1 first quarter, the TritOns 
caught the scent of blood and 
began their slaughter. In a stellar 
performance that IOcluded a hat 
trick by Triton el1lor Matt Ellis,

combined goals for the victOry, 
including junior Jonathan 
Hopkins' team-high 46th goal of 
the year and junior Brandon 
Borso's team-second 34th. 

UCSD played at an even high-
er level on Ocr. 26. In the day's 
opener, Santa Clara tried to keep 
pace with the Tritons' offen e, but 
suffered a 2 -I first-period deficit. 
This would be the closest score of 
the game as UCSD stepped up its 
defen ive measures for a econd 
quarter 3-0 shutout. With a 5-1 
halftime lead, the Tritons added 
three goals in each of the remain-
ing quarters, while allowing only 
three more opposition goals in the 
remainder of the game. 

Hopkins took charge of cor-
ing as he secured three Triton 
goals followed closely by cores 
from enior co-captain Matthew 
Ustaszew ki and juniors Nate 
Cooper and Clarke Peterson. 
Peterson finished the game with 
twO goals. 

The final game of the tourna-

Seniors lead women's 
soccer in a grand finale 

By ALAN McBROOM 
Staff Writer 

The last time the UCSD 
women's soccer team met the 
Grand Canyon squad, the TritOns 
squeaked by with a 1-0 victory in 
Phoenix. Their second match on 
Nov. ) was a completely different 
story. UCSD dropped nine first-
half goals on their way to a 14-0 
trouncing of the Antelopes. Before 
the match, Triton seniors were 
honored in front of the 305 fans in 
attendance at the final regular ea-
on home game of 2003. 

UCSD hit the back of the net 
early and often on their way to a 
football-like final score. Firnngly 
enough, four of the nine senior 
scored, including a hat trick by 
Kristin Jones. Senior Kristen 
Conahan opened things up early, 

scoring her sixth goal of the year in 
the fourth minute. This wa fol -
lowed by twO goals in a row from 
Jones, including a magnificent 
effort where Jones collected the 
ball at midfield, beat rwo Grand 
Canyon defender and took it all 
the way in herself. The Tritons 
found themselves up 3-0 with less 
than 10 minutes of occer played. 
Fellow senior Megan Mendoza 
added a tally, as well as freshman 
Kelly Cochran - scori ng her
