The UC Commission on the Future visited UCSD’s Price Center 
East Ballroom on Nov. 6 to 
listen to the concerns and needs 
of the UCSD community. 

The UC Office of the 
President claims to have created 
the commission to collect public 
input on various aspects of the 
UC system — an effort toward 
creating a collaborative vision of 
the university’s future.

The commission will report 
back to the regents with its 
findings in the spring or summer 
of 2010. Its body consists of 
more than than 25 members 
and five working groups 
addressing the size and shape 
of the UC system; education 
and curriculum; access and 
affordability; funding; and 
research strategies.

“The purpose of the 
commission is to gather 
recommendations as to how we 
might re-envision the future,” 
UC Santa Barbara professor 

and “size and 
shape” working 
group co-chair 
Cynthia Brown 
said. “Given the 
fiscal constraints, 
we want to think 

in creative ways as much as 
possible.” 

The commission is 
conducting a listening tour, 
on which it will visit each UC 
campus to gather ideas from 
staff, faculty and students 
on how to best address the 
university’s financial crisis. The 
commission has already visited 
UC Irvine, UC Merced, UC 
Santa Barbara and UC Santa 
Cruz. 

The Nov. 6 meeting at UCSD 
was led by a six-member panel: 
UC Santa Cruz Chancellor and 
“size and shape” co-chair George 
Blumenthal, UC San Francisco 
professor and “research 
strategies” co-chair Mary 
Croughan, UC Davis associate 
professor and “education and 
curriculum” co-chair Keith R. 
Williams, student regent and 
“access and affordability” co-
chair Jesse Bernal and UCOP 
chief financial officer Peter 
Taylor. 

Chancellor Marye Anne Fox 
opened the meeting with an 
introduction, and was followed 
by a brief speech from each 
panel member about his or her 
specific area of focus.

Pre-selected administrators, 
staff, faculty and students were 
then given time to speak, making 
way for an open comment 
period in which any member of 
the public could voice concerns 
to the commission.

Union Cries 
‘Shame’ on 
VA Labor 
Contract

By Regina Ip
Contributing Writer�

Local unionized construction workers are protesting 
the VA Medical Center and Scripps Green Hospital’s 
use of private contractors, accusing the two hospitals of 
contributing to unfair wages and increasing statewide 
costs of health care. There are, however, conflicting 
statements from different sources as to whether or not 
this is the case.

Construction trade union Carpenters Local 1506 is 
claiming a labor dispute with William Rogers Drywall 
— a non-unionized subcontractor — as well as with 
general contractors the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
and Pacific Building Group.

The USACE has been hired by the VA hospital, 
while the PBG is working for Scripps Green Hospital.

The Los Angeles-based worker union claimed that 
these contractors are not meeting area labor standards, 
such as providing payments for family health care and 
pensions. Union members are currently staging protests 
at the two sites to encourage the hospitals to hire union 
labor instead.

“VA hospital has an obligation to the community to 
do all it can to see that area labor-standards contractors 
are used for construction on their hospital,” union heads 
announced in a statement.

However, according to William Rogers Drywall 
co-owner Jim Horn,  though his workers receive no 
pension, vacation time, dental or eye insurance, their 
paychecks are comparable to union ones that have 
medical benefits subtracted from the total. 

Union workers demand hours;
hospitals argue that non-union
contractors meet labor standards.

Defense and foreign ministry offi-
cials from North Korea, the United 
States and four other countries con-
vened at UCSD late last month to 
discuss regional security issues and the 
global economic crisis. 

Sponsored by the UC Institute 
on Global Conflict and Cooperation, 
the informal meeting — which took 
place from Oct. 25 to Oct. 27 — fos-
tered talks between senior officials and 
academics from North Korea, South 
Korea, China, Japan, Russia and the 
United States. Discussion focused 
heavily on the North Korean nuclear-
weapons program. 

Defense officials were present from 
all countries except for North Korea, 

who instead sent only foreign-ministry 
officials. Where defense officials are 
meant to specifically address issues 
like nuclear proliferation and disarma-
ment, foreign-ministry officials serve 
a more general purpose.

Ri Gun, director gen-
eral of the North Korean 
Ministry’s American 
Affairs Bureau, attended 
the forum along with 
special envoys Sung Kim, 
from the U.S.; Grigory 
Logvinov, from Russia; 
Huh Chul, from South 
Korea; Yang Houlan, 
from China; and Ishii 
Masafumi, from Japan. 

According to Susan 
Shirk, director of the 
IGCC, the forum — 

which was part of the 20th session 
of the Northeast Asia Cooperation 
Dialogue — was not intended to result 
in immediate change in foreign policy. 

“Major diplomatic breakthroughs 
are never expected to 
result from these discus-
sions,” Shirk said. “It’s not 
going to achieve denu-
clearization overnight.” 

Shirk said the late-
October talks were 
conducted to foster the 
return of the official Six-
Party Talks, which were 
initiated in 2003 when 
North Korea backed 
out of the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty and 
discontinued when the 
United Nations Security 

Council condemned North Korea for 
nuclear activity in April 2009.

“The long-term aim is really to 
prevent the outbreak of military con-
flict in the region,” Shirk said. “We 
are hoping that this type of track-II 
dialogue will, over the long term, lay 
a foundation for permanent official, 
multilateral security organization for 
Northeast Asia.”

Communication between the U.S. 
and North Korea dwindled after North 
Korea performed nuclear testing last 
April. Though North Korea remains 
critical of official U.S. diplomatic 
efforts, Shirk said the NEACD forum 
is an attempt to encourage dialogue.

“We are hoping the discussion may 
help six-party talks resume; if possible,

POORLY DRAWN LINES By Reza Farazmand

AS PER USUAL By Dami Lee

“The real reason they’re having the 
labor dispute is because they wanted a 
union company to work for the hospi-
tal,” Horn said.

According to Scripps Green 
Hospital spokesman Johnny 
Hagerman, the hospital itself is not 
responsible for subcontracting con-
struction labor; contractors like the 
PBG choose whom to hire for specific 
aspects of construction jobs.

“When unions want to bring pub-
lic attention to these things, the thing 
that they usually do is picket in front 
of the business,” Hagerman said.

However, Hagerman explained 
that because the PBG has no physical 
headquarters, the union workers are 
holding their protests on the property 
of the hospital that awarded the com-
pany its contract.

“So the signs that you see say 
‘Shame on Scripps,’ [but] it’s really the 
union’s only way of trying to get at 
the construction company,” Hagerman 
said. “It doesn’t have anything to do 
with Scripps at all.”

Because the issue does not directly 

involve either of the hospitals, Scripps 
Green Hospital has not responded to 
the union. The VA Hospital claimed it 
has communicated with the union in 
the past, though the union denied this.

The VA hospital released a state-
ment saying it is in compliance with 
the wage requirements 
mandated under the 
Davis-Bacon Act — a 
federal law stating that 
construction contracts 
over $2,000 commis-
sioned by federally 
funded companies are 
required to provide pre-
vailing local wages  and 
benefits.

“We are in compli-
ance with proper pay 
benefits,” VA Hospital 
spokeswoman Cindy 
Butler said. “We’re not 
violating any laws.”

Contractors with the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers said they will be 
performing an audit in the upcoming 
months to ensure that the VA Hospital 
is in compliance with the labor laws.

Union workers are arguing that 
hiring non-union labor will lead to 
unfair wages and, ultimately, re-allo-
cated taxes, when the state is forced to 
pay for the health care of uninsured 
workers. The union also provides 
fringe benefits for its members, such 

as paid vacation; appren-
ticeship and training; 
and life insurance.

“I have a good sal-
ary and benefits, [so] 
my family lives better,” 
carpenter and protester 
David Meling said. 

Randy Thornhill, a 
business representative 
for the union, said the 
two hospitals have not 
yet responded to the 
protest. 

“They have not told 
us anything,” Thornhill 

said. “They’re probably going to take 
the position that ‘It’s out of our hands.’ 
[But] we’re saying that they have a 
social responsibility when they select 
contractors that pay area standards to 
all their workers on all their jobs. They 

should be more [selective] of who 
works on their property.”�

rwip@ucsd.edu.

An article published on Oct. 26 
titled “Muir Barely Passes $4 Fee 
Increase” incorrectly stated that 
Muir’s spring fee referendum 
proposed a $2 fee increase every 
two years. In fact, fees would have 
increased $2 every five years.

An article published on Oct. 29 
titled “Registration Fees Pulled From 
Student Services” incorrectly stated 
that registration fees will be redi-
rected to the Registrar’s Office and 
Office of Admissions; this is not, in 
fact, the case. The article additional-
ly stated that a new faculty furlough 
plan will save UCSD $75 million. It 
will in fact save $25 million.

comments from the San Diego 
campus and community and get 
their input on what the community 
wants to work on,” Croughan said.   
 Through the series of UCSD speakers, 
numerous concerns were raised 
— including fee increases, layoffs, 
financial aid, campus funding and 
differential fees. Students and faculty 
alike spoke to the issues closest to 
them, most of which stemmed from 
funding cuts. 

“Young professors — many of 
them have built their careers at UC,” 
associate professor Rachel Klein said. 
“That’s not going to happen any 
more as our jobs become degraded 
and funding for student and staff 
support evaporates. These faculty 
cannot be replaced by lecturers.”

A number of students and staff 
echoed Klein's concerns about 
decline in faculty.

“Just a few years ago, the 
undergraduate student-to-faculty 

ratio at UCSD was approximately 
20 to one,” A.S. campuswide senator 
Adam Kentworthy said during the 
open comment period. “Faculty 
layoffs and hiring freezes in the past 
year have pushed that number to 
almost 40 to one. Cutting freshmen 
seminars at UCSD earlier this year 
has further distanced students from 
faculty. There is no replacement for 
face-to-face contact with a professor 
in the scope of education. Is this what 
we’re paying for?”

Many speakers disclosed concerns 
about the increase in student fees, 
speaking to both the fact that students 
may have to unenroll as fees grow 
higher and that prior fee increases 
have not necessarily produced visible 
results.

“When I started school here as 
an undergraduate [in 2000], I was 
paying about $900 for my education 
fee,” graduate student and former 
registration-fee committee chair 
Garo Bournoutian said. “As of today, 

the undergraduate education fee is 
over $1,900. It has more than doubled 
— but as undergraduate students, 
what more have you received? You 
have received larger classes and less 
faculty interaction time. That’s a big 
issue. If we’re looking at the future of 
the UC, where are we going?” 

The commission will be 
conducting the remainder of its 
campus visits through November and 
December. According to Croughan, 
the commission originally intended 
to have its recommendations 
completed by March 2010, but is 
now looking to extend this deadline 
to summer 2010.

The regents will be visiting 
UCSD soon as well: They have 
announced another open forum 
on Jan. 19, 2010, at which UCSD 
community members can voice their 
concerns before university officials.

that it may help the U.S. and North 
Korea start talking to one another with-
in the context of the six-party talks, 
[which is] an important framework for 
trying to resolve issues relating to the 
Korean peninsula,” Shirk said.

The global economic crisis — and 
its impact on Northeast Asia — was 
also discussed at the meeting.

“An important goal that I person-
ally have, and that NEACD has, is 
to encourage the transformation of 
North Korea’s economic system so 
that they will introduce market-style 
reform,” Shirk said.

By helping North Korea carry out 
liberal market reforms, she said, other 
nations can encourage the country 
to become more dependent on for-
eign trade and investment — in turn 

reducing the likelihood of conflict. 
“Contact with the World Bank and 

international monetary fund are some 
ways we’d like to nurture their interests 
in economic reform,” Shirk said.

The group also discussed China’s 
general financial success following 
the crisis as a possible source of sup-
port for nearby regions.

“One of the important develop-
ments is that China is recovering 
first, and that its recovery is helping 
its neighbors as well,” Shirk said.

The first NEACD forum was held 
in 1993 at UCSD. According to Shirk, 
officials from China and Korea put 
more effort into this discussion than 
earlier ones.

“In the early years, China was reluc-
tant to join in these types of multilateral 
security dialogues,” Shirk said. “I saw a 

tremendous change in China’s interests, 
so it has become a very enthusiastic 
supporter of multilateral security coop-
eration in Asia. As for North Korea, it 
also has become more comfortable in 
participating in forums like this, in the 
sense that all of the members of delega-
tion speak. They are a lot more relaxed 
and participate quite actively.”

Since the six-party talks are not 
currently underway, the track-II dia-
logue offered by NEACD may lead to 
official talks.

“[You] can sense that all the coun-
tries, including North Korea, are 
eager to get back to the official talks, 
though it remains difficult to say 
when this will happen,” Shirk said.

In standard at-home rags — an XL fisherman’s T-shirt and shape-less UCSD sweats — there I lay, 
surfing the web for something easier 
to swallow than the usual influx of 
nauseating felony reports.

After about a minute of impatient 
browsing, I struck gold. There, in 
sepia, stood a woman in a beehive 
hairdo and mock turtleneck sweater. 
I’d finally found my kicks — all 
beneath the blog heading “My Mom, 
the Style Icon: Moms as Fashion 
Muses.”

It was too good to be true.
A collection of mom photos 

uploaded by fellow surfers, the site 
serves as a tribute to our fearless 
fashionista mothers, who sported bell 
bottoms and chunky wooden chokers 
like it wasn’t a thing.

My mom, for one, had just 
emerged from the ’80s neon-spandex 
phase during our “take your daughter 
to work” bonding days. And when 
your mom is an aerobics instructor, 
her work uniform is 10 times more 
in your face than usual. I remember 
squinting at her Richard Simmons-
style curls rocking out to Madonna 
during a Jazzercise course, bangs 
bouncing maniacally to every last beat 
of “La Isla Bonita”. 

It wasn’t until age seven that I real-
ized not every grown woman grocery 
shopped in spandex.

The mom fashion-icon site is 
evidence that once upon a time, our 
mothers strived to be emblems of 
fashion. They strutted their stuff, just 
like you and I — some maybe even 
at UCSD, checking themselves out in 
Geisel’s mirrored walkway. 

And judging from some of yester-
year’s biggest icons — Farrah Fawcett, 
Cyndi Lauper and the one redheaded 
chick from “Dallas,” to name a few 
— my own mother was an attentive 

imitator, a blinking 
red dot on the “hot” 
radar.

Why, then, do 
we still feel infinitely 
cooler than our 
mothers? I mean, 
had technology not 
blessed me with the 
divine gift of the flat 

iron, I’d be sporting the same unruly 
’fro as Mrs. Marrujo herself, putting 
me one oversized-sweatshirt-and-
booty-short combo away from her 
atrocious early ’90s phase. 

As I glanced down at the T-shirt 
I was still swimming in, it suddenly 
looked remarkably like something my 
mother would have worn over stirrup 
leggings when she was my age.

Shit!
The same masterminds that con-

trolled our mothers’ fashion choices 
are still swaying our vote: the fresh, 
young faces owned by the media. 
Whether it’s Lauren Conrad (for us) 
or Twiggy (for Mom) determining 
what’s cool, it’s really no one’s fault 
but the money-grubbers direct-
ing pop culture from the rack up. 
Why else would we pick up those 
weird, “Afrika”-print leggings from 
American Apparel? For what other

ON CAMPUS  — Leading up to last spring’s 
2009’s A.S. election, then-A.S. presidential 
hopeful Utsav Gupta made a monumental 
promise: he would “uncage” the Sun God 
Festival. 

One presidential victory and a lazy sum-
mer later, Gupta has cooked up a couple more 
details for his campaign promise. He’s propos-
ing a party in every corner of the campus — 
from Revelle College’s shady cement hallways 
to Sixth College’s expansive green fields. While 
this plan may make the happiest day of the year 
that much better, there’s one problem: Gupta is 
pushing the six colleges to fund his promise. 

But if anyone wants to see such a revolution-
ary Sun God change, with limited resources and 
Fall Quarter already coming to a close, we’ll 
need to think small this first time around.

 Among other promises — Library Walk 
booths and additional ticket distribution cen-
ters, to name a couple — the crux of Gupta’s 
vision includes pairing the colleges into teams 
of two (according to geographic location) for a 
total of three separate events the morning of the 
Sun God Festival. 

Said sideshows, according to Gupta, are 
entirely up to the discretion of the college 
councils. They could be something as gleefully 
simple as Sixth College’s Chocolate Fest or a 
full-fledged 9 a.m. concert starring a band you 
(sort of) dig. 

Though Gupta wants each college to make 
its Sun God Festival event its own, it’s probably 
too late in the budgetary game to ensure each 
college can afford anything more than a free 

hot-dog stand.
According to Marshall College Council 

Chair Tanvir Dhillon, although his council’s not 
willing to spend its every last penny on a Sun 
God event, Marshall has $7,000 in unallocated 
funds and $7,000 in project funds that could 
be used for Sun God. Warren College Council 
Chair Emily Law, however, said she feels her 

college would need to dig 
painfully deeper into its 
$20,000 events budget to 
make “Sun God: Warren” 
a reality. 

A.S. Associate Vice 
President of Concerts 
and Events Alex 
Bramwell said he fears 
that the administration 
won’t be game for a cam-
puswide free for all. But 
even on the offchance 
that Vice Chancellor of 

Student Affairs Penny Rue gives an inebriated 
ice-cream social the green light, not every col-
lege is willing to pony up.

While Law said she is excited about Gupta’s 
plan, she apparently doesn’t foresee Warren dip-
ping into its reserves to fund it. It’s important to 
remember that reserves are just that: reserves. 
If college councils do use their reserves this 
year, they won’t be a reliable funding source for 
future Sun God popcorn stands. 

Every college, with the exception of Eleanor 
Roosevelt, has already passed its budget for the 
year, so picking up an entirely new event will be 

far from smooth sailing. Just two weeks ago, 
Muir College passed a referendum necessary 
just to keep existing orgs and events afloat. With 
such full plates already, expanding college coun-
cils’ commitments would be irresponsible. 

Another major concern for Law is that 
because the funds for a Sun God event would be 
coming out of Warren’s student fees, it should 
be primarily benefitting Warren students. While 
the entire student body may not make it to each 
college event — blacked-out Muir freshmen 
probably won’t care to stumble all the way to 
Warren for a free romp in a bouncy house — in 
passing the bill to the already emaciated college-
council budgets, Gupta is blurring the A.S. and 
college council funding lines out of their com-
fort zone. 

 Currently, none of the college councils have 
even an estimate of the size or cost of the Sun 
God Festival events Gupta has proposed. And 
just in terms of safety and security, every col-
lege would have to follow a set of UC Police 
Department stipulations and regulations. 

Last year, Muirstock security cost $3,100. 
Even though Gupta doesn’t anticipate the 
individual colleges to host events as large as 
Muirstock, since no event of uncaged-Sun 
God magnitude has ever been planned, college 
councils are swimming in murkily untested 
waters, especially in terms of security costs. A.S. 
Concerts and Events spent nearly $60,000 on 
security last year — a pretty sum that would rise 
by the thousands once our beloved day of may-
hem is spread across the entire campus.

In the end, who doesn’t want this to work? 
So hopefully, Gupta’s Disneyland dream won’t 
end up another half-baked idea stuck in the 
pipeline. Financing college-specific events will 
require a strict sense of fiscal conservatism 
that the A.S. Council has not so far expressed 
when referencing their newly inflated Sun God 
budget. Recruiting student bands and looking 
to local vendors for cheap catering (quality be 
damned — free food is free food) could help 
keep the cost of these events low. The goal of 
these daytime gigs, after all, is to unite our stu-
dent body — not to divide the college and A.S. 
councils even further and burn through every 
last cent for the future.

Dear Editor,
I write to correct an important 

error in the Oct. 29 front page 
article entitled “Registration Fees 
Pulled from Student Services.” 

The article mistakenly stated 
that, due to cutbacks in state funds, 
Student Affairs is channeling 
registration fees toward areas nor-
mally funded by state funds, such 
as the Registrar’s Office, Office of 
Admissions and Relations with 
Schools, etc. 

This has not occurred. No such 
use of registration fees is planned, 
at least on this campus. 

Student Affairs, supported by 
the Registration Fee Advisory 
Committee’s recommendations, has 
worked very hard in a difficult bud-
getary environment to maintain the 
distinctive character of the registra-
tion fee for student co-curricular 
and developmental programs and 
services — not for core institutional 
or academic functions appropri-
ate for the education fee and state 
funds. 

— Edward J. Spriggs
Associate Vice Chancellor, 

Student Affairs 

Dear Editor,
Both your editorial board and 

the A.S. Council seem a little con-
fused. Why is it so offensive that 
the university will turn over your 
e-mails when the law requires it? 

When a judge issues a legal 
subpoena, you must comply or face 
punishment. When a judge issues 
a subpoena for student e-mails, the 

university is compelled by law to 
produce them. 

The “change” in ACS policy 
reflects the university’s existing 
legal duty to comply with subpoe-
nas. It isn’t some conspiracy by 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox to 
invade your privacy; if anything, 
the new language is the university’s 
way of letting you know exactly 
what your rights are. 

It’s a clarification, and not an 
unusual one. 

Gmail does the same thing: It 
will hand over your e-mails when 
an “applicable law, regulation, legal 
process or enforceable governmen-
tal request” requires it (check www.
google.com/privacypolicy.html). 
Yahoo! Mail will also disclose 
your personal information when 
required to do so by law, or “in a 
good faith belief ” that disclosure is 
necessary to respond to claims that 
your e-mails violate the rights of 
third parties.

If you want to defy subpoenas 
and face jail time, design your own 
e-mail system and use it. Or move 
to Azerbaijan to escape the juris-
diction of U.S. courts. But as long 
as you use an existing e-mail ser-
vice provider in the United States, 
your e-mails will be subject to sub-
poenas. Sorry.

reason would Mom rock a camel toe 
in those high-waisted jeans?

What prevails throughout all gen-
erations is the idea that we don’t know 
what looks good on us until some 
kind of celebrity flaunts it on the red 
carpet. One week a muumuu-draped 
Mary-Kate Olsen gets eaten alive by 
the paparazzi in Greenwich Village, 
and the next a big-boned girl from 
Minnesota snatches an overpriced 
look-a-like sweater for no other rea-
son than to do like the stars do. 

Truth is, there will always be hits 
and misses in the fashion world. Yet 
as much as our Friday night outfit-
choosing ritual may be dictated by 

whatever Paris Hilton sported in her 
latest crotch shot (beyond the Brazilian 
wax), we also get to tai-
lor our choices to work 
best on us. (I’m sure my 
mom thanked heaven 
for the big-haired ’80s 
movement — finally, 
something she could 
manage!) 

Re-browsing “My 
Mom, the Style Icon,” I see women no 
more convinced of their own fashion 
sense than we are today, just trying 
to figure out what’s most stylish (and 
at least semi-comfortable) to slip on 
in the morning. In hindsight, I can’t 
really blame them for whipping out 

the Nancy Sinatra knee-highs — at 
least those are easier to slip into than 

skinny jeans.
As for me and my 

mom? We have differ-
ent skin tones and face 
shapes, sure — but as 
for hair and body type, 
we’re one and the same. 
Scoff though I may at 
those shoulder-padded 

floral blazers collecting dust in the 
cobwebbed depths of Mom’s closet, 
I can’t guarantee I probably wouldn’t 
have made Jennifer Beals from 
“Flashdance” my style icon, too, had 
I been a working girl in the ’80s — 
spandex wedgie and all.

THE GREAT

DIVIDE
BY EDWIN GONZALEZ // FOCUS EDITOR

I n the last 20 years, America’s political climate has hit a sweltering fever pitch. Political polarization is at an all-time high  — and political-science professor and researcher Gary Jacobson has the polls to prove it.According to Jacobson, who has been conduct-
ing research on political polarization over the past 
40 years, partisan politics are dictating elections and 
political decisions as moderate politicians are being 
forced to pick sides. Even if those partisan politics have 
recently begun to refuse compromise on progressive 
issues.

“I think Republican politicians have made a consid-
ered choice that their best choice in the long run is to 
just say ‘No’ [to progressive reforms] — to not respond 
— because their core supporters are not at all interested 
in support for [President Barack] Obama,” Jacobson 
said.

Relying on data from commercial, academic and 
media polls gathered over the past decade, Jacobson 
synthesizes statistics to map out the Bush era in a broad 
historical context of pivotal events. 

 In response to pressure from ideologues, activists 
and fellow politicians, he argued, moderate Republicans 
and Democrats are gravitating to the most outspoken 
of their constituency. Six months after Obama’s inau-
guration, the difference in approval ratings between 
self-identified Democratic and Republican voters (as 
measured by media polls) returned to similar levels of 
polarity as during President Bush’s tenure. As apparent 
in Obama’s current approval ratings, Congress is still 
heavily divided — and the gap only continues to widen. 

Sitting at a desk overcrowded with poll data and 
yellow notepads, peering from behind gold-framed tor-
toiseshell glasses, Jacobson described his research with 
the subtle piquancy of a Congressional insider.

“In the last four years of the Bush administration 
… Bush’s approval among Democrats was in the single 
digits,” Jacobson said. “That’s really low — nobody ever 
gets into the single digits.”

Rather than advocating for more moderate eco-
nomic policies — a tactic many political hopefuls have 
employed — party polarization has led representatives 
to seek backing from their most solid base of support: 
liberal progressives and conservative fundamentalists.

According to Revelle College junior Alec Weisman, 
editor in chief of the California Review — UCSD’s one 
politically conservative newspaper — a rise in bipar-
tisanship is unlikely if Obama continues pursuing an 
agenda with which Republicans aren’t interested in 
associating. 

“I think if he had actually wanted to push biparti-
sanship, he should have stuck to the issues that were 
bipartisan,” Weisman said.

After the economic collapse in 2007, presidential 
contender John McCain’s popularity fell in the polls, 
according to Weisman. And even with the momentum of 
his win — Obama still hit a speed bump when he began 
pushing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act 
of 2009. According to Jacobson’s poll data, Obama’s 

A n observation of the growing gaps in national income and widening politi-cal divisions across the country, Keith 
Poole’s “Polarized America” is a sociological 
investigation of partisan differences. 

Over the last three decades, U.S. income 
inequality has swelled to an unthinkable size 
and Poole — along with Princeton profes-
sors Nolan McCarty and Howard Rosenthal 
— notes it sharply in his latest bookish 
prose ripe with time trends, financial statistics and footnotes. 

Although they begin by explaining their unique method of 
collecting data (a system they pioneered: collecting roll-call votes 
from both the Senate and the House), they plod through public 
policy like your everyday analyst for the greater part of the text.

Though the income gap has increased substantially, Poole 
argues, redistributive policies such as progressive taxing and 
welfare programs have been overwhelmed by voters unaffected 
by the inequity. Social issues such as immigration, he goes on to 
explain, have taken a dramatic toll on public opinion as well — 
especially when most voters agree that redistributive policies at 
the very least should not apply to illegal immigrants. 

In the end, Poole’s combination of economic analysis and 
social scrutiny puts a spotlight on prominent political disen-
franchisement; shining a liberal light on the casualties of our 
nation’s obdurate opinions.

W ithout relying on Kitty Kelly’s grape-vine gossip or Oliver Stone’s simian caricatures, Gary Jacobson tackles 
George W. Bush’s eight-year reign with a 
pundit’s penchant for statistics. 

Democrats and Republicans alike had a 
tumultuous relationship with the commander 
in chief, and isn’t hard to see why as contro-
versies seemed to surface every six months.

After Sept.11 and the capture of 
Saddam Hussein, Bush’s ratings floated on secondhand patri-
otic highs — only to take a tumble after the levees broke in 
Louisiana and photos leaked from Abu Ghraib’s prisons. 

Unlike most books on Bush, Jacobson’s thoroughly aca-
demic chunk of research doesn’t dwell too long on political 
indictments — though you might still catch them, couched 
between to-the-point prose and hanging from line graphs.

Dour political tensions weren’t entirely Bush’s fault either, 
as Jacobson takes pains to explain in his first chapter. In 2000, 
Bush entered a political arena still seething from an inglorious 
impeachment trial less than a year before. And, to make mat-
ters worse, he rode in on the carcass of the Florida recount.

Whether you thought him an honest stalwart who stuck 
to his guns or a stubborn dolt without any political gump-
tion, Jacobson’s plethora of polls and surveys create a collec-
tive canvas hard to dismiss as sheer liberal bias.

LA JOLLA ECOLOGICAL RESERVESITESEEN

THE  BOTTOM LINE

W ithout a ride, escaping UCSD for a little slice of the natural world is a daunting and exhausting task. But if you man up, flash your Free Bus Zone sticker and ride 
the MTS bus route 30 a mere five stops south of campus, you’ll 
find yourself dumped breezily into the famed La Jolla Ecological 
Reserve. Established in the 1970s, the reserve spans 6,000 under-
water acres off of La Jolla Shores — ripe with sandy flats, kelp 
beds and underwater canyons. 

A far cheaper alternative to Sea World, the reserve is teeming 
with sea life ranging from guitarfish and stingrays to dolphins 
and sharks. It’s even home to a series of caves — a main attrac-
tion for snorkelers brave enough to flipper through a dark grotto 
or two.

The less daring, however, can try their hand at kayaking or 
paddleboarding. You might encounter a scary wave or two on 
the way out, but they’ll make for some excellent surf on the way 
back. Feel free to get creative: Take a blow-up floaty or scramble 
down the cliff side and jump right into the water.

La Jolla’s seven caves — dubbed the White Lady, Little Sister, 
Shopping Cart, Sea Surprise, Arch Cave, Sunny Jim’s Cave and 
Clam’s Cave are hidden within a 75-million-year-old sandstone 
sea cliff. Poke around a little and you might even stumble upon 
some treasure — those pesky out-of-towners have been known 
to forget a digital camera or two.

Take advantage of these last few rays of sunshine before 
finals strike: Water visibility peaks at over 30 feet down, where 
sea animals are hankering for some swimming buddies. You’ll 

find leopard sharks hanging out by the La Jolla 
Beach and Tennis Club and sea lions guarding 
the entrance to the caves. And with the rush of 
tourist season coming to a close, you might just 
get them all to yourself.

T hough it may seem like you’ve run out of useless skills to learn — having mastered DJ Hero and the dance routine in the latest “Single Ladies” video), you might be tempted to pick 
up a hobby that doesn’t require gyrating your pelvis for 20 straight 
minutes.

Despite the fact that it may seem a little out of your grasp.
Not so, said Muir College sophomore Clay Johnson, a principal 

member of the Muir College Juggling Club. 
Started in 2006 by UCSD alumnus Kevin Nazario, the organiza-

tion has one noble goal: to spread the art of juggling to all those 
willing to try 
— whether 
you’re looking 
to refine estab-
lished skills or 
stumbling in 
as a three-ball 
virgin. 

According 
to Johnson, it 
usually only 
takes 15 min-
utes to learn the 

basics, and the rest comes naturally after a few weeks of messing 
around. 

“There’s a lot of people starting out,” Johnson said. “Each meet-
ing, people who are walking by come up to us and they just want 
to learn.” 

Club leaders provide one-on-one help to all their members, the 
majority of whom are new and can only juggle only three or four 
balls. Johnson himself holds the distinction of keeping the most 
clubs in the air simultaneously: an impressive eight. 

Apart from solo ball-tossing acts, the club also encourages part-
ner and group work. Its most entertaining trick is a mesmerizing 
eight-club hot potato toss between two people. 

Muir College Juggling Club has received a plethora of fanfare 
over the years, from being photographed by passersby to per-
forming at Muirstock 2009. The club will be performing at Muir’s 
annual festival again this spring in addition to attending juggling 
galas like the Los Angeles Nomadic Juggling Festival this Saturday, 
Nov. 14.

The club’s meeting times change every quarter. However, for 
the rest of fall, you can find them every Wednesday from 3:30 p.m. 
to 5 p.m. on Sun God Lawn (in front of the Applied Physics & 
Mathematics Building). Johnson invites you to drop by — because 
who knows? Within 15 minutes, you could be on your way to 
developing a not-so-hidden talent.

WORLD FAMOUS HAMBURGERS

Shortly after introducing the bill, the 
president’s approval ratings among 
Republicans began to suffer. 

One key difference from previ-
ous years, however, was that political 
protestors were focusing more on 
economic issues than social ones.

According to Weisman, the 
conservative party is going back to 
its roots. He said that many fiscal 
conservatives were disenchanted 
with then-President George W. Bush 
after he crafted his 2008 stimulus 
bill; as a result, they’ve begun to 
support more hard-line candidates. 
And, considering summer rallies, he 
predicts a new wave of conservative 
activism could be upon us. 

“I think the right is starting to 
stand up,” Weisman said.

This past summer, as activ-
ists known as Tea Party Patriots 
marched through DC and the Senate 
Judiciary Committee vetted then-
Supreme Court nominee Justice 
Sonia Sotomayor, Jacobson was 
updating his 2006 book A Divider, 
Not a Uniter: George W. Bush and the 
American People. Based on new polls 
from the final three year’s of Bush’s 
presidency, Jacobson analyzed the 
evolution of Bush’s partisan upshot. 

 “We thought [political polar-
ization] had peaked with [former 
President Bill Clinton’s] impeach-
ment, which was an incredibly par-
tisan division that [Congress] had 
to vote on,” Jacobson said. “But we 
thought it was over, and then Bush 
gets elected through Florida.”

Though Clinton’s impeachment 
trial was a pivotal benchmark for 
political polarization in the U.S., 
Jacobson’s 2006 book explains that 
the concept isn’t by any means a 
recent phenomenon. 

According to Jacobson, politi-
cal polarization has swelled from 
social issues since the 1960s — most 
specifically, after the Goldwater cam-
paign in ’64.

Jacobson has charted correla-
tions between party identification 
and positions on icy issues. Based on 
voter surveys, since 1972, the steep-
est increases in polarization have 
been over more touchy social issues 
such as welfare, affirmative action 
and abortion. 

According to Jacobson, 25 years 
ago, one’s opinions about abortion 
were unrelated to his or her identi-
fication as a Republican. In fact, he 
said, Republicans tended to be more 
pro-choice. Yet by 2004, 63 per-
cent of self-identified Republicans 
thought abortion should be illegal 
under all circumstances — compared 
to only 34 percent of Democrats.

Keith Poole, another political-
science professor at UCSD, has con-
ducted similar research on political 
polarization. By analyzing roll-call 
vote patterns — the recorded “Yea” or 

“Nay” votes 
on proposed 
legislation 
used by 
Congress 
— Poole, 
along with 
two other 
researchers, 
has found 
that the gap 
between 
congressio-
nal parties 
has been 
expanding. 

In plac-
ing the 
roll-call vote 
from each 
member of 
Congress on 
a liberal-to-
conservative 
spectrum, 
Poole and 

his collaborators concluded that 
Republicans are increasingly more 
conservative as Democrats more 
liberal. 

Of course, there are also other 
popular explanations for these par-
tisan divisions that Jacobson said 
he’s taken into account — one being 
increasingly biased news sources. 

“There’s definitely been height-
ened polarization, especially with 
the 24/7 news cable coverage that’s 
going on nonstop,” Marshall College 
junior and President of the College 
Democrats at UCSD Victor Lin said. 
“You have all the talking heads going 
on every hour of every day.”

Debate over the Obama admin-
istration’s recent tussle with the Fox 

News network mirrors a similar 
dilemma at UCSD. Though the 
California Review boasts many 
moderate members, its articles don’t 
always reflect the opinions of the 
moderately conservative. 

“When you look at the California 
Review and you look at the rest of 
the on-campus environment, there 
needs to be someone to put out a 
more conservative position because 
there are currently two liberal news-
papers and then there’s the Guardian 
— which, in a lot of cases, does veer 
left,” Weisman said.

 (Weisman added that a wider 
breadth of views is available to read 
on the student organization’s blog, 
www.ucsdcalreview.wordpress.com.)

Though much of Jacobson’s 
research has indicated that politi-
cal polarization is on the rise, many 
politically active students — on the 
right and left — are bridging the gap 
with open dialogue.

Lin admitted that if there is any 
difference between the national 
Democratic Party and the College 
Democrats at UCSD, it’s probably that 
the students lean more to left.

At a recent debate between the 
College Democrats at UCSD and 
College Republicans over same-sex 
marriage, the “don’t ask, don’t tell” 
policy and the stimulus bill, Lin said 
he was surprised that many young 
conservatives were willing to admit 
that some traditional conservative 
positions are flawed.

“When it came to ‘don’t ask, don’t 
tell,’ most of [the Republicans] were 
supportive of repealing that,” Lin said. 

According to Weisman, most 
moderates are politically apathetic. 
But he said he still believes that com-
promise is key if we want to escape 
the cycle of presidential referendums.

“Polarization is completely an elite 
phenomenon: [It] is among the activ-
ists and pundits and the politicians 
— whereas the rest of the population 
is not divided in the same way,” said 
Jacobson. “And there’s some truth to 
that. The people who are the least 
divided are the people who are the 
least involved in politics — the least 
knowledgeable about politics.”

JOHN HANACEK/GUARDIAN
The Tritons — who had never before lost to San Francisco State — dropped a Nov. 6 match to the Gators that ended their season-best 16-game win streak. Only 
two games remain in the 2009 regular season for the No. 2 Tritons, who will enter the playoffs vying for their first-ever Division-II national championship.

for portions of the night, but service 
errors by the Pioneers helped power 
the Tritons through Cal State East 
Bay, as the Tritons took a victory 
25-16, 25-20, 25-18.

On Nov. 7, the Tritons improved 
to 12-0 overall against Cal State 
Monterey Bay with a 25-18, 26-24, 
25-21 victory. Sophomore libero 

Roxanne Brunsting had an outstand-
ing night, registering 21 digs and 
three aces — including an ace to put 
away the second set. 

“We’re just working toward that 
national championship,” Schmidt 
said. “I’m not saying we’re going for 
sure, but we’re definitely working 
toward it. Our goal is to be a great 
team, but we think by winning a 

national championship, it will be a 
great measure.”

UCSD will host the final two 
games of the regular season: one  
against Sonoma State on Nov. 13 and 
another against Humboldt State on 
Nov. 14.

halftime.
UCSD finally saw its offensive 

work pay dividends in the 53rd 
minute, when the Tritons tied the 
match at 1-1. The equalizer came 
when a shot by sophomore mid-
fielder Shelby Wong was deflected 
back into the box, giving freshman 
midfielder Jessica Wi the chance to 
charge in and punch the ball past 
the Toro goalkeeper for her fourth 
goal of the season. Wong was cred-
ited with the assist — her fifth of 
2009.

After Wi’s game-tying goal, both 
teams continued to battle closely; 
neither surrendered a goal through-
out the remainder of regulation. 
With the match tied 1-1 at the final 
whistle, both teams geared up for a 
10-minute overtime period. 

“Everybody was tired,” Wethe 
said. “Everybody was looking to 
dig deep and pull through for their 
teammates by scoring a goal and 
ending the game.”

After the first overtime period 
played out to a scoreless draw, the 
game moved into a second 10-min-
ute overtime. After both teams 
were blanked once again, the match 
moved into penalty kicks to decide 
who would advance to the confer-
ence championship.

Cal State Dominguez Hills elect-
ed to shoot first after winning the 
coin toss, and the Toros buried their 
first shot. The Tritons’ first shooter, 
Wethe, sailed her kick too high and 
to the right, giving Dominguez a 1-0 
lead after the first round.

The next three penalty kicks 
were successful on both sides: junior 
midfielder Lisa Bradley, sophomore 
midfielder  Sara Bolton and fresh-
man forward Alyssa Newcomer all 
found the net for UCSD, setting up 
the decisive Dominguez Hill shot.

The fifth and final shooter 
for the Toros went right, beating 
Armstrong for the decisive penalty 
kick to seal the victory.

Despite the loss, UCSD held a 

13-10 shot advantage in the match, 
including a 3-1 edge in shots on 
goal. The Tritons totaled six corner 
kicks, while the Toros finished with 
two. 

“I thought we played extreme-
ly well, especially in the second 
half,” head coach Brian McManus 
said. “You’ve got to give Dominguez 
credit. They were very well-pre-
pared, and they had an excellent 
plan if it went to [penalty kicks]. We 
missed one shot and that was the 
difference.”

In the other matches in the 
CCAA Championships, No. 1 seed 
Cal State Los Angeles defeated 
No. 4 seed Chico State 1-0. The 
Golden Eagles then defeated Cal 
State Dominguez Hills on Nov. 8 by 
a score of 4-0 to capture the CCAA 
Championship and earn an auto-
matic birth into the NCAA West 
Regionals.

Hough 6-2, 4-6 (10-2). Ling’s and 
Nguyen’s experience in the champi-
onship will aid UCSD in facing off 
against Azusa Pacific University in 
the Tritons’ second match of the 2010 
spring season.

In the second day of the tour-
nament, Placek lost to USD’s Charl 
Wolmarans 6-0, 6-1. Junior Erik 
Elliot, who had already received an 
automatic berth into the main draw, 
lost a close match to UC Irvine’s 
Stephen Stege 6-4, 6-4. Fellow was 
likewise unsuccessful in his Round of 
32 match. He fell to UCLA’s Holden 
Seguso 6-2, 6-0.

When the tournament’s doubles 
competition got underway Thursday 
afternoon, the Tritons proved equally 
unsuccessful against their Division-I 
competitors. 

Fellow and Ling lost to UC 
Riverside duo Quoc Doan and 
Felix Marcherez 8-2. Sophomore 
Chapman Chan and Placek suffered 
a defeat against UC Irvine’s Fabian 
Matthews and Shimpei Suzuki 8-2. 
Junior Armaun Emami and freshman 

Austin West, who were crowned ITA 
West Region Doubles Champions 
and put on a strong performance at 
the ITA National Champions, lost a 
close contest against LMU’s Renzo 
Maggi and Malet 8-5.

The Tritons fared slightly better in 
their singles matchups on day three 
of the tournament, as Nguyen edged 
past UC Santa Barbara’s Finkelstein 
— one of the Gauchos’ best players — 
in a tough 7-6, 6-3 matchup. 

After a back-and-forth third-
round match, Ling eventually grabbed 
a victory against UC Irvine’s Zac Tsai. 

After Ling lost the first set to Tsai 
6-2, he went on to win the second set 
6-3, forcing a tiebreaker. 

Ling took the match after a 10-4 
tiebreaker, advancing to Saturday’s 
semifinals to face Azusa Pacific 
University’s Janosch Apelt.

Day three for the Tritons also 
saw Fellow lose his match against 
Pepperdine University’s Fanselow 
7-6, 6-1, and Placek enter another 
tie-breaking set only to lose 6-7, 6-0 
(10-5) — the official end of their 
run in the Southern California 

Intercollegiate Championship.
In the tournament’s final round on 

Nov. 7, Nguyen faced Azusa Pacific’s 
Janosch Apelt in the semifinals of the 
singles qualifying back draw and was 
quickly swept 6-0, 6-0. 

Ling defeated UC Riverside’s 
Quoc Doan to set up his champion-
ship match with Apelt. 

Apelt, a transfer student from 
Germany, had few problems defeat-
ing Ling — and took the qualifying 
back-draw title with 6-2 and 6-0 wins. 

“[Ling] played well,” Steidlmayer 
said. “It was a good tournament for 
him overall. He took on some tough 
opponents — especially today with 
Apelt. That’s the way it goes.” 

The Tritons’ appearance at the 
Southern California Intercollegiate 
Championship concludes a men’s fall 
schedule that included three open 
tournaments but no team competi-
tions. UCSD returns to action for its 
spring season on Feb. 1, when it hosts 
Concordia Irvine.

In 1953, the United States Supreme Court

WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL — With a 
resounding thud at the end of a forgetta-
ble Friday night, the No. 2 UCSD women’s 
volleyball team suffered its second loss of 
the season. 

The fall to the San Francisco State 
Gators on Nov. 6 ended a string of 16 
straight Triton victories. Despite 20 kills 
from senior captain outside hitter Sylvia 
Schmidt, the Tritons were not able to over-
come 41 kills delivered by San Francisco’s 
top two hitters. It was the Tritons’ first 
ever loss to the Gators, who are vying for 
a wildcard playoff spot into the NCAA 
regional tournament.

Early in the first set, the Tritons kept 
pace with the Gators, holding the game 
within one point for most of the set before 
San Francisco went on a 12-5 run to take 
a commanding 18-10 lead. The Tritons 
could not pull within more than four 
points through the rest of the set, and the 
Gators finished it off 25-19.

UCSD came out fast in the second 
set, pushing ahead for most of the match 
behind an impressive performance by 

senior captain setter Elaine Chen. The 
Gators did not get closer than within five 
points of the Tritons, and Schmidt put the 
set away with a kill at 25-16.

After halftime, the Gators gained 
some first-set style play. With a persistent 
attack and few errors, the Gators went 
on a mid-set run to a 20-12 lead, then 
cruised through the rest of 
the set to take a 25-15 vic-
tory.

In the fourth set, neither 
team could pull away from 
the other, and the squads 
battled head to head. The 
Gators took a match point 
lead at 24-23, but a kill from 
Schmidt and an ace by Chen 
gave the Tritons their first 
set point. 

Unfortunately for UCSD, 
the Gator offense soon deliv-
ered a kill to stop their run. 
The Tritons took three more 
set points, but each one was 
followed either by a service 
error or a Gator kill. When 
San Francisco State had its 
second opportunity at match 
point, they took full advan-
tage with a block that sealed the upset 
victory.

“We’re really clear on [what] we need 
to get better at,” head coach Tom Black 
said. “We know what we need to work on.”

Despite the defeat, the Tritons sand-

wiched their loss with two three-game 
sweeps against Cal State East Bay, and 
against Cal State Monterey Bay, on Nov. 
4 and 7. The victory against the Monterey 
Bay Otters brought UCSD’s season record 
to 26-2, tying Black’s all-time record for 
wins in a single season.

“There’s a sense of urgency now,” 
Black said. “We’re getting into 
the home stretch. So we want 
to take care of the patches and 
focus now as we’re getting into 
the playoffs.”

On Nov. 4, the Tritons 
cruised to a victory over the 
Cal State East Bay Pioneers, 
showing solid offense through-
out the match by notching a 
team .316 hitting percentage. 
Redshirt freshman middle 
blocker Julia Freidenberg hit at 
a .500 clip and picked up eight 
kills on the night, as Schmidt 
added nine kills of her own. 
Sophomore outside hitter Katie 
Condon had four kills in the 
first set — her only set of the 
night.

“We have a lot of depth 
on our team,” Schmidt said. 

“I think that Tom [Black] was trying 
to get everyone an opportunity to play 
tonight.”

WOMEN’S SOCCER — The UCSD women’s 
soccer team tied 1-1 with Cal State Dominguez 
Hills on Nov. 6  in the opening round of the 
2009 California Collegiate Athletic Association 
Women’s Soccer Championship. However, after 

battling No. 2 seed Cal State Dominguez Hills to 
a 1-1 draw through regulation and two overtime 
periods, the No. 3 seed Tritons were eliminated 
from the tournament in a 5-3 penalty kick shoot-
out.

UCSD now has a record of 14-5-1 and 
awaits Monday’s announcement of the NCAA 
Tournament field to see if its season will con-
tinue.

“The plan was the same as it had been in 
previous matches,” sophomore midfielder Anne 
Wethe said. “To come out and pass the ball, get 
open and play hard.”

The Toros drew first blood in the hard-fought 
contest, seizing a 1-0 lead in the 35th minute 

when a free kick from 35 yards went over the 
head of Triton sophomore goalkeeper Kristin 
Armstrong.

“Obviously no one wants to be behind in a 
game,” Wethe said. “I think the general feeling of 
the team was that we weren’t out of the game at 
all, that we were going to come back and score.”

The Toros attempted four shots in the first 
half. Of those attempts, the fourth and final shot 
was the only that found its way into the net. In 
contrast, the Tritons fielded a more aggressive 
offense, taking five shots and four corner kicks. 
Nonetheless, the Toros maintained a 1-0 lead at

MEN’S TENNIS — The UCSD 
men’s tennis team held its own at 
the 53rd annual Southern California 
Intercollegiate Championships from 
Nov. 4 to Nov. 7, despite entering a 
competition stocked full of Division-I 
opponents.

“As a team, we preformed well 
and at a high level,” head coach Eric 
Steidlmayer said. “Going into the next 
season, we need to be the best com-
petitors. There were teams in the 
competition that did that, and we 
need to take that [mentality] and win 
every match.” 

In the qualifying rounds on Nov. 
4, sophomore Jake Fellow beat UC 
Santa Barbara’s Josh Finkelstein 2-6, 
6-2 (10-4). However, in the following 
round, Fellow lost to UCLA’s Alex 
Brigham 6-2, 6-2.

Redshirt junior Alex Placek 
advanced to the Round of 32 due to 
his first opponent’s withdrawal from 
the tournament. 

Placek then breezed past Loyola 
Marymount University’s Nick 
Vonderahe 6-2, 6-1, advancing 
to face his next opponent on Nov. 
5: University of San Diego’s Charl 
Worlmarans.

In UCSD’s other opening-round 
matchups, LMUs Otto Sauer defeated 
sophomore Sam Ling 6-1, 6-0; junior 
Vincent Nguyen lost to Borja Malet 
of LMU 4-6, 7-6 (10-3); and redshirt 
freshman Austin West lost to UCLA’s 
Ahmed Ismail 6-4, 6-0.

Ling and Nguyen made amends 
for their Wednesday losses the fol-
lowing day by rebounding with a pair 
of solid victories against two fresh-
men from Azusa Pacific University. 

Ling defeated Pacific’s Ilja 
Ikannikov 6-0, 6-4, while Nguyen 
took his match against Whitman

UCSD saw its 16-game win streak come to an end after a four-set defeat to San Francisco

“We’re getting into the home
