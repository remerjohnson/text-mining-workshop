comprised of faculty and 
staff, have determined that 
the subject discussed and 
materials used in Professor 

atherine Lord 's "Feminist 
Issues in Studio Art" class 
were accertabl and apr ro-
rriate. The class, which fea-
tured works dep icting chil -
dren in sexua ll y co lllprollli~­

following a cotnrlaint hy 
junior Karen Logan, a ~tu ­

ment to the {'II ' UI/il 'ersil.\', 
Lord argued that rainting~ 
and other artistic mediullls 
used in her classes disrlay 
different artistic styles that

Weekly Pot Protest 

TATE COLLEGE, Penn . -
Ken Krawchuk , the 
Lihertarian candidate ror gov-
ernor of Pennsy lvania, joined 
retired Pennsy lvania 
Professor Julian Heicklen in 
his weekly marijuana protest. 
About 100 people gathered to 
show their support for the 
legali zation of marijuana, a 
key issue on the Libertarian 
platrorm . In the last state 
guhernatorial election, the 
Libertarian Party - the third 
largest political party in the 
country - garnered 2 percent 
of the vote. Also in atten-
dance at the protest were stu-
dents and community mem-
bers charged with possess ion 
of marijuana, along with 
Heicklen, two weeks ago.

Stanford's Tenurlng 
PALO ALTO, Calif. - The 
Women 's Coalition for 
Gender Equity, a group of 
Stanford faculty members, 
released a report criticizing 
Stanford ror its record in hir-
ing and tenuring women fac-
ulty members. In 1993, only 
13.3 percent of tenured facul -
ty were women, placing 
Stanford far behind most 
comparable schools. The 
report call s for the university 
to more actively work to 
increase the percentage of 
female tenured faculty. With 
regards to hiring, the report 
states that more than twice as 
many men as women have 
been hired to the faculty. 
Stanford administrators said 
the stati sti cs used to make 
these claims are ques ti onable 
because of the low numher of 
tenure cases that come up.

Fascinatin'Rhythm 
The UCSD ballroom dance team is sweeping people off their feet 

By Marc Comer 
Staff Writer 

Hiding deep within the depths 
of UCSD's vast array of club 
sports is something known as 
Dancesport - competitive danc-
ing. 

Started nine years ago by three 
or four students who came from 
competitive-dancing back-
grounds. the ballroom dance team 
at UCSD has been growing ever 
since. 

Typically the team consists of 
two teams, the fonnation team, 
which competes, and the training 
team. This year, however, with 
enough student involvement and 
qualified dancers the UCSD ba\l-
room dance team consists of three 
teams: two formation teams and a 

training team. 
At the beginning of each year 

the dancers vote on the style of 
dance they want to perform. In 
the past several years, having 
only one formation team, the 
dancers have voted to perform 
Latin-style dance. This year, hav-
ing two formation teams, the 
dancers voted on two styles of 
dance: American smooth and 
swing. 

The team changed to 
American smooth dance for a 
change of pace and chose swing 
as its second style of dance 
because of swing's new-found 
popularity. 

"One of the reasons we arc 
doing swing is because there is a 
huge interest, especially among 

the young population, to learn 
that sort of dancing," Team 
Captain Rhea Kimbel said. 
"We're here to grab more people 
and to get more young people 
interested in dancing. The best 
way to do it is to put what they 
want in." 

To make the team, dancers 
were required to learn a short 15-
to 20-second routine. Then, after 
practicing the routine for a couple 
weeks, judges who had never 
seen the dancers perform before 
were called in to score each 
dancer. 

Finally, those dancers that 
scored high enough moved to one 
of the formation teams. The 
remaining dancers were invited

DETAILS: Alksne will 
promote cooperation 
between providers 
By Terry Lew 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD will soon propose a way 
to reduce the duplication of expen-
sive health services in San Diego 
while preserving its basic patient 
care, research and teaching mis-
sions, admini strators sa id 
Thursday. 

Although details were scarce, 
john Alksne, vice chancellor for 
heahh sciences and dean of .he 
UCSD School of Medicine, told 
the San Diego Regional 
Healthcare Advisory Council that 
he would submit within the next 10 
days his vision of greater coopera-
tion and collaboration among San 
Diego's competing healthcare 
providers. 

The 21-member counci I was 
convened in June 1997 by County 
Supervisor Dianne Jacob. Its three 
charges are to evaluate San 
Diego's healthcare-de1ivery sys-
tem, to predict what it would look 
like in five years if funding 
remains at current levels, and to 
suggest ways to improve the sys-
tem overall. 

"San Diego has some of the 
finest medical facilities in the 
country, and it is certainly some-
thing to be proud of - but there 's 
still room for improvement," said 
Supervisor Ron Roberts, who co-
chairs the panel together with 
Jacob.

Focus Group Evaluates Undergraduate Preparedness 
PLAN: Participants 
complain students lack 
communication skills 
By Quyen Tu 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD Corporate Focus 
Group presented its report on how 
UCSD could improve its prepara-
tion of undergraduate for careers 
in the private industry to a panel of 
faculty members and student lead-
ers la t Wednesday at the Faculty 

lub. 
The focus group was created at 

the request of Joseph Watson, vice 
chancellor of student affairs. The 
memhers of the group represented ' 
12 local San Diego busi nesses 
ranging from Qua1comm to 
Agouron Pharmaceuticals. 

In his introductory speech to the 
panel, Watson said the Corporate 
Focus Group was assembled because 
"a fairly large number of our gnldu-
ates go into the private sector." 

After six meetings, the group 
eame up with what it felt were the 
trengths of UCSD, identified areas 

of weaknesses and made ugges-
tions for improvemt;nl. 

At Wednesday 's meeting, the 
group mainly discussed how UCSD 
students could be better prepared 
for the workplace. 

The focus group commended 
U SD for the strong technical and 
analytical ski\ls that its graduates 
possess. The focu group also 
acknowledged the university'S 
increasing interaction with the 
business communilY. 

However, a majority of the 
meeting time ~·a pent discussing 
way in which UCSD could beller 
prepare undergraduates for the 
business world. 

The focus group wncluded that 
UCSD students did not have all of 
the qualifications Ihat would enable 
them to keep up with the demands 
of industry. 

"[ UCSD students.! arc typically 
a younger graduating class," said 
Ellie Glaser, manager of communi-
ty affairs at Qualcomm. 
"Experience levels with the gradu-
ate is a bit less." 

Another observation the focus 
group made was that UCSD gradu-
ale expect 10 earn ridiculously 
high starting salarie .

At Wednesday 's meeting, the 
group mai nly discussed how UCSD 
students could be beller prepared 
fo r the workplace. 

The focus group commended 
UCSD for the stro ng technical and 
analyti cal skills that its graduates 
possess. The focus group also 
a(; knowledged the universit.y's 
increasing intera(; tion with the 
business community. 

However, a maj rity of the 
meeting time ;';-as spent discussing 
way in which UCSD could beller 
prepare undergraduates for thc 
business world. 

The focus group concluded that 
UCSD students did not have all of 
the qualifications t.hat would enable 
them to keep up with the demands 
of industry. 

"IUCSD students] arc typically 
a younger graduating class," said 
Ellie Glaser, manager of communi-
ty affairs at Qualeomm. 
"Experience levels with the gradu-
ate is a bit les ." 

AnOlher observation the foc us 
group made was that UCSD gradu-
ates expect to earn ridiculously 
high starting salaries.

"They mark you off for tech-

grueling as any other sport ," 
Kimbel said. 

Competitive dance is analogous 
to many sports rolled into one. 
While the team dances as a group, 
partners arc also gi ven the opportu -
nity to compete in a number of 
individual events, much like track 
and fi eld. The scoring system that 
the judges use is much like that of 
ice skating. And like sym:hronized 
swimming, the ' team must perform 
with incredible uniformity. 

While dancing is very competi -
tive, it is also a very social sport.

L ike any other sport , Ihe dance 
team has student cuptains. Along 
wi th Kimbel is co-captain Nikki 
Haritatos. The l1allrool11 dance 
team must also manage fund s, plan 
fundraisers, set up competitions 
and hire judges. 

To help with these duties, they 
ca ll upon secretary Jen Ahrams and 
treasurer Michael Pugh. .

quite a workout ju~t like gymnas-

In halJroom d(lI1cing, everything

hy profe~s i onals on everything 
from uniformity and tim ing to the

"So ri ght then, you get a new

To see thc team in ac ti on, go to 
its first w mpetition of the year, thi s

Letting voters choose from all candidates

court to face charges for hi s role in 
Iryi n,g to influence an electi on. 

Baugh recruiled a decoy to run 
in the 1995 Democr.lli c pany pri-
mary, attempling 10 si phon off 
Democratic votes and split the vote 
wilhin the party. A damaging inter-
nal food tighl would then have 
occurred within the Democralic 
pany. 

The open primary would allow 
Machiavellian game plans, similar 
to Baugh 's, 10 intluence elections. 

Committed party members who 
already sacrifice much will not lind 
it hard to influence the other party's 
elections. Take, for instance, the

one should have any stro ng aftilia-
ti on wilh any of the major r1rties, 
excepl a devoled few. The greatesl 
contact most people have with the 
parlies is the lillie box they check 
off when reg istering to vote. 

With thi s in mind, is it any rc~" 
l o~s to lower the wa ll of partisan-
ship and allow people 10 choose 
the besl person for Ihe job, regard-
less of party affi li alion, in the elec-
ti ons? 

For those arc afraid Ihal lhe 
op-: 11 primari es wi ll remove any 

last presidential primary. To clinch 
the Republican nomination, 
Senator Bob Dole had to win over a 
majority of the states' delegates. 

On thc olher side was the 
incumbent, President Bill Clinton, 
who ran virtually uncontesled. All 
the loyal Democrats would have to 
do in an open primary would be to 
vote for Ihe leasl elec table 
Republ iean candidate to sabol age 
the opposing party. They could do 
thi s because Clinton's nominalion 
was never in doubt and he did not 
need the votes. 

If a signilicant number of votes 
were cast for any other Republican. 
Dole would have been badly 
embarrassed by not being able to 
capture the party's nomination. If 
the roles were reversed , with an 
unopposed Republican runni ng, 
Republicans would only have to 
vote for the least-electable candi-

signiticance lhat the political par-
lies may have left. the election of 
polilica l party-commillee members 
will be unaffecled by the new poli-
cy. 

There arc also calls from politi -
ca l-parly leaders that Ihe open pri -
maries arc unconstilulional. They 
claim thai Ihe new system restricts 
a politica l pany's First Amendment 
ri ghl 10 choose its candidates. 

Politica l parli e wi ll still ex isl 
and, hy and large, will st ill have Ihe 
abi lity 10 choose who wi II represenl 
lhem in Ihe primary election. In 
addilion. the new system also hdp~

date to hurt the Democratic pany. 
Such events would skew a gen-

eral election and harm American 
democracy. 

Political scientislS say the opcn 
primary wi ll allow for Ihe disheart-
ened to gel back into Ihe political 
fold . More candidates will bring 
back vOh;rs to Ihe fold. 

In actualily, however, Ihe open 
primary ohfuscales Ihe mailer. 
Voters already complain that they 
have a whole slew of issues to 
research and vote upon. With the 
open primary, they will have to 
make more dec isions between can-
didales. 

An effort to gel more people 
involved in elections started Ihe 
idea of the open primary. 
Proponents suggest that people arc 
led up with everyday partisan poli -
ti cs, and that the open primary is 
the way to fix such a lackluster alli -

against lhe va lidity of Ihe system. 
Last November, U.S. District Court 
Judge David Levi ruled thai il 
should be allowed to go ahead . 
Several pany leaders expressed an 
inleresl of ci reumvenling the sys-
lem by creating a new syslem or 
reso rt ing 10 the caUClI, system. 

One of the grealesl benefil s of 
Ihe new system is Ihat 1.5 million

change how elections will he con-

To vote for a ccr.tain candidate, 
all one has to do is helong to the 
politician 's pany. Changing panics 
takes a mere live to 10 minutes. 
One can change his regi stration as 
Illany times as he sees lit. 

Hypothetically, if one wanted to 
see a candidate in office, an indi -

said candidate.

Revelle freshman Laura Gibson recounts her successful struggle 
against brain cancer as she prepares to return to UCSD 

... __ ike most freshmen, 18-year-o ld Revelle stu-
dent Laura Louise Gibson races grueling midterm s, terrible 
dorm food, on-l:ampus housi ng and early morning classes. 
Most student s, however, don't receive radiation trealment 
for tcrminal brain canl:er five days a week before lheir 
French class. 

Di agnosed wi th brain cancer (g li onl astoma multiforme) 
in the middle of her senior yea r of high school. Gibson is 
l:urrentl y anending UCLA while receiving lreatmenl. Every 
morning at 8:30 a.m .• Gibson goes to trealment. She doesn' t 
seem to mind. 

When she first started having dizzy spells in October of 
her senior year in high school, Gibson was given vilamins 
for poor nutrition. After the vitamins didn 't seem to help, 
Gibson went back to the doctor. 

l! was then di scovered that the dizzy spells weren' lmere-
Iy whirling sensalions, but short seizures. Having a hislory 
of ear problems. Gibson was given Claritin and antibioti cs 
- and insomnia . 

While driving 10 Escondido High School with her 
sister one morning. Gibson had a seizure and scraped 
a guardrail. She returned to the doctor, and as tests 
for possible anemia came up negali ve, she was given 
an MRI. 

Somelhi ng unusual was found. Gibson had to he 
seen by a neurosurgeon and, six days laler. under-
went her first brain surge ry, which lasted for two 
hours. 

" I figured, 'Well, lhi s is what I have to do. 
Okay, I might as well do it ,' but I was al:tually 
scared out of my mind ." Gibson sa id . 

T his first surgery removed the grade four tumor 
(rour signifying the most malignant , one being more 
beni gn). 

Gibson received a second MRI, which indicated 
that a large portion or benign tumor sti II remained with-
in her brain. After fl yi ng to the M.D. Anderson Cancer 
Center in Houston. dOl:tors told Gibson she would need 
ye t an ther surgery. She postponed lhe surgery for a cou-
ple or weeks to parli cipate in the acade mic deca thlon, 
hecause her team was going to lhe state w mpetition. 

" I went to lhe w mpetilion knowing rull well that the 
next week I was going to ha ve brain surgery again." 
Gihson said . 

For her second surge ry. Gibson was rererred to Dr. 
Black, a renowned and expert neuros urgeon at 

CLA. This second surgery lasled six hours. 
'" didn ' t rea ll y rcmemher the nex t day;" 

Gihson said . 
Gibson dedil:aled m st or her suml11er 10 

eycles of chemot herapy, which postponed her 
plan~ to go to Europe. Beca u~c the intravenou~ 
part of the chemot herapy was making her lose 
her hearing, Gihson opted to onl y continue with 
the oral parI. 

Last rai l, Gih~on began her lir~ l year at 
C D. while still reccivi ng chcmotherapy. She 

took the usual rreshman cour~e load, made 
somc new rri ends, dined at the Plala Cafe and 
co mpleted four or six cycle~ or l:hemoth .: rapy before 
heading to UCLA for radi ation treatmenl. 

"Typicall y. doctors like cancer patient s to go through six 
l:ycles of chemotherapy and all convcntional therapies 
before trying anything unusual or weird." Gibson ex pl ai ned. 
"So the nex t step was radiation ."

Searching For A Soulmate 
A 'lonely Alaskan drops $100, 000 on a cross-country quest for true love 

LIFE: 
Student aspires to 
do lab research 

Awards: 
'" got stuff from doing the aca-

demic decathlon. I got an award 
from the California Senate and 
got to meet the govemor and sit in 
on a senate meeting, I got to go up 
to Sacramento with the team that 
won state. They showed me all 
these places. 

By Ilona Fasl 
Senior Staff Writer 

This past winter, nalive Alaskan 
Jay Ramras packed his bags and 
headed soulheasl - to New York 
to be exact. Allhe ripe age of 33. he 
was not just looking for a good 
deli ; he wanted 10 find hi s fulure 
wife , The catch was , she had to be 
Jewish and she had to be willing 10 
move back to Fairbanks with him, 
Four months later, the Guardian 
tracked him down to see if he had 
any luck, 

More than $100,00 down and 75 
dates later. there's good news and 
there's bad news, The good news: 
Ramras has had no prob lem finding 
women who would be willing 10 
move back to Alaska with him 
(over 15 havc offered so far), He's 
even found a woman with whom he 
could consider spending a lifetime, 
The bad news: They arc not Ihe 
same person, 

So Ramras ' quest for love is sti ll 
in progress. 

Ramras attrihutes hi s dirficuhy 
to thc negalive stereotypes associ-
ated wi th Alaska , a state he ca ll s 
the most beautiful place on Earth . 

"To my uller shock and surpri sc." 
he said. " the rest of Amcril:a docs 
not fi nd il a desirable place to l ive," 

With childhood fri cnds, a thri v-
ing restauranl busi ness and a 
Jewish sy nagogue Ihat he helped to 
bui Id. Ramras does not want to 
leave Fairbanks, 

After exposure in New YiJfk 
magazine, USA Today, People 
Weekly and all Ihree m ajor ncl -

works, his search has become a 
household cause and hi s personal 
li fe has been open to public scrut i -
ny, Strangers call to give him 
advice; parents ca ll 10 let him know 
aboul their daughters, 

" It 's very stran ge," Ramras said. 
" LaSI night someone from Phoenix, 
Ariz" called to suggest that I 
should broaden my search, Today, I 
received a telephone ca ll from a 
man who ca lled about his daughter 
who lives in Washington. D,C, The 
wife suggested that 1 show up in 
Washington and surprise the 
daughter." 

But does all the hoop la bother 
him'! " It ·s intrusive in a nice way." 
he said. 

If nOlhing else , hi s search has 
thickened hi s skin. 

"When people follow their 
heart , they have negat i ve asper-
sions cast on them ," Ramras said. 
" I made an intimale search, and it 's 
open 10 publi c cri licism," 

Ramras commented upon his 
situation. 

" I'm nol desperate." he said. 
" I ' ve had a 101 o f Jewish women 
who propositi oned me," 

Rumras has had multiple oppor-
tunities to use his search for I>cr-
sonal gain, Severa l film companies 
have as ked to tape him, The week 
before Valentine's Day. a radio sta -
tion inqu ired about featuring hi s 
story, Rarnras decli ned. 

" I'm nol Irying to generale se l f-
driven ego opportunities, " he sai d , 
" I have an opportunit y to be a role 
model for young Jewish people," 

Since he has made it so clear 
Ihat the woman he wants to marry 
must be Jewish, Ramras has inad-
vertently received a national plat-
form to speak about the issue of 
Jewish assimilation. 

Although Ramras feels blessed 
because there are so many Jewish 
people in New York, time and dis-
tance are beginning to take their toll . 

" I feel like I ' m living two 
li ves," he said, " I have to leave 
because my businesses arc begin-
ning to suffer," 

So what do people think at 
home? The Fairbanks community 
is cert ainly aware of what Ramras 
is doing, In fact . after friends sub-
milled his name 10 the magazi ne 
Alaska Mell . he was featured on Ihe 
fronl COVI!r. H owever, with h is 
adamant desire to marry within the 
Jewish fai th and his incompatihili -
ty wilh both of the only two Jewish 
women in A laska, Ramnls knew he 
had to take mailers into his own 
hands, 

Ramras is not going to retreat 
from his quest for love until he 
finds somebody, " My spirit has

Gargantuan Greetings, UCSD! 

In the mood for mouth watering meals? Cany6~ 
Vista is the place for tantalizing Italian cooking 
and savory Asian cuisine, as well as quick 
submarine sandvviches, yummy grilled foods, fresh 
baked goodies, and a giant salad bar stuffed with 
crazy toppings! Just the other day, Pierre and I 

decided to escape EI Nino at Canyon Vista with a hot and hearty 
lunch by the fireplace, I dined on the pasta primavera with white 
clam sauce, a huge piece of buttery garl ic bread, and tasty steamed 
vegetables, The pasta was absolutely to die for - rich, creamy, 
and al dente! And should you indulge yourself in the exquisiteness 
of Canyon Vista, don't miss the fresh bread, made from their own 
secret blend of herbs, spices. and rich butter! 

Pierre decided to feed his fancy at Chopsticks, 
which serves a myriad of Asian dishes, specially 
prepared by cook Xi Lan Xu! Pierre feasted on the 
orange chicken, stir-fry bok choy, and fried rice. 
Pierre tells me the tender chicken was perfectly prepared in its 
sweet and spicy orange glaze, He also expounded on the virtues 
of the bok choy, also known as Chinese white cabbage, as the 
best he'd ever dined on, and low in fat tool We could go on for 
days about the delightful decisions to be made at Canyon Vista, 
but for now I'll just tell you to try the lerno" bars for dessert! Your 
taste buds will thank you! 

Love, 
A rdchell

Are you afraid of dying? 
Why or why not? 
Interviews by Marc Comer 
Photography by Kendra Walker 

"It 's not my number-one 
fear because there are too 
many other things more 
Imminent. Studies show 
that death is not people's 
number-one fea r because 
people fear all thi s other 
stuff. They don ' t think 
about death. I don ' t think 
about it; I'm 2J years old." 

Harry Holstrom 
Revelle Junior 

"No, not really." 

5umlt Dua 
Warren Sophomore 

"Yeah, a little, because 
you don't know what hap-
pens - if you go to obliv-
ion or you go to heaven or 
you go to another life. You 
just don't kriow." 

Alexlanne Searle 
Roosevelt Senior 

''I' m not afraid of dying 
because everyone knows 
it's coming. It 's just kind of 
an inevitable part of life 
that you have to accept 
because you have no 
choice." 

Kenna Clifton 
Revelle Junior 

"No, because I think it 
might be easier than liv-
ing."

LIFE: 
Experience has

Continued from pag. 9 
new friends is kind of hard. 

"UCSD i, a really great place to 
he. lI 's rea lly pretty. While you 
don 't have Westwood Village right 
there, you have the beach. You 
have something interesting to look 
at-other than rows and rows of con-
crete. And I don ' t mean the SlUan 
An Collecti on." 
Who or what has been the 
greatest Influence In your life? 

"I would have to say thai proba-
bly my experi em:e that I' ve gone 
th rough. Whi Ie thi s is not a great 

.thing to happen and I wouldn ' t 
wish it on anybody, but it 's given 
me a completely different perspec-
ti ve on life. I ha ve no idea why my 
life just changed so drastka lly." 

Gibson's battles wi th cancer 
have impacted almost evcry a pec t 
of her life. 

.. It changes your whole view-
point of what's important. You sud-
denly rea li ze it 's the little things 
that arc important , even if they <Ire 
the most annoying things in this 
world. You think that there m<ly bc 
the smallest chancc that you won' t 
bc able to do that something agai n. 
You rea lize that although the big, 
imponant moments in life are great 
and everything, the moments we 
label big and important aren't nec-
essarily the most imponant things. 
You rea li ze it 's the people and the 
lillie thi ngs that matter." 

Laura also cited a teacher and a 
coach, Mrs. Boldt; as a source of 
motivation. 
Pet peeve: 

"I hate it when you' re going 
through somcthing rea ll y tough, no 
mailer w~at it is (not just my expe-
rience), and people come up to you 
and say 'Oh, I understand.' They 
rea lly are just trying to be nicc, but 
you think 'No you couldn ' t. ' After I 
had to get an MRI. someone came 
up to me and said, ' I broke my leg 
and had to get an MRI once. I know 
just what you' re goi ng through.' 

"A lot of times I worry about 
people pitying me. II 's really kind 
of an insult. People are trying to be 
nice and empathize or sy mpathize 

MThe Important thing 
Is not focusing on 
the fact that It 
might be your last 
day or not. A lot of 
the cure Is In your 
attHude. You have 
to have a good 
attHude about It. My 
advice would be to 
really figure out 
what Is Important. 
Don't think every 
day Is your last." 

- Laura Gibson 
Revelle Freshman 

wi th you, but it kind of tri via lizes 
it. However, them bei ng there for 
you is great. You want to know 
people are there. 

"Also, I' m kind of a neat freak 
too." 
Most unique quality: 

"I' ve always prided myse lf on 
academics. J always thought that is 
what defi ned me. I was go ing to be 
the most intellectual of all inte llec-
tuals. 

''I'm also one of those suckers 
who still believe in the American 
Dream. But the thing that keeps me 
go ing mosl... I'm probably the 
most stubborn person on the face of 
the earth . I'm also very stoic. It 's 
sort of a pride thing. My family 
also keeps me goi ng." 
If you were to change one thIng 
about UCSD, what would It be? 

"The rain. When it rains, from 
Reve lle to Price Center there's 
always a river. However, lhat's a bit 
superficial. The thing that 's really 
neat up here is that UCLA is like a 
little town. While we have that 
somewhat in our colleges, there 's 
no place to walk to or do anything." 
What's the best thIng about 
UCSD? 

"The hot chocolate machine. I 
worship it. I didn ' t know it was 
there for half the quarter and I real-
ly love hot chocolate. I acc idental-
ly bought ome fat -free stuff, and 
then I found it." 
What does the treatment do to 

Monday, March 2, 199M 

you? 
"It 's known to make yo u more 

'ti red and take lots of naps. I take 
naps more often. Also, it makes 
your hair fa ll out." 
What are some myths about you 
sItuation? 

"I have a problem with people 
who think it 's your last day on earth ." 
What has dealing wIth cance 
taught you? 

"It changed my perspective, and 
taught me a lot of things aboul peo-
ple and their reactions. It really 
strengthened my faith in God . 
While I'd always believed becau e 
I was rai sed be lieving, I now have 
conviction. 

"It also forces you to focus on 
the things that arc most important 
to you and to try and do them as 
soon as you can. In my si tuation 
I'm lucky. Everything is has been 
going well and it looks like I'm 
defini tely go ing to outli ve my orig-
inal prediction of five years. They 
don ' t have a prediction now." 
What advice would you give to 
someone who Is facIng a sItua-
tion like yours? 

"The important thing is not 
focusing on the fact that it might be 
your last day or nol. A lot of the 
l:ure is in your attitude. You have to 
have a good attitude about it. My 
advice would be to really figure out 
what is important. Don ' t think 
every day is your last." 

Currenll y, Gibson is still at 
UCLA receiving a specialized 
treatment ca lled "conformal radia-
tion" that uses computer software 
to target the cancerous area, 
decreasing the l:hance of harming 
imponant areas of the brai n. When 
fini shed, she wi ll continue with the 
final two cycles of chemotherapy. 

Gibson is ad mi red for her 
strength and perseverance by many 
indi viduals. 

"Here IS a student who is 
ex hibiting incredible maturity," 
said Thomas Bond , Reve lle 
provost. "She is one determined 
young woman." 

Stephanie Wai , Gibson 's room-
mate at UCSD, said she admires 
Gibson for everything she goes 
through and for not allowing can-
cer to overtake her life. 

Gibson wi ll be retu rning to 
UCSD for the spring quarter.

Life's Little Disasters Demand 
Optimism And Maturity 
By Mary Higgins Senior Staff Writer 

Lasl week, I heart.! a riddle Ihat 
goes like thi s: every day a man t a ke~ 
th l.! elevalor down from Ihe 361h 
floor or hi. apanl11enl and goe~ 10 
work. When he gets home al night , 
he always t a l. c~ Ihe slairs hack up, 
except when it rai n" in which case 
he takes the elevator. Why'! 

Relax , herl ck, r II save you

is a mit.!gct and ha~ to take the , tail'S

elcvator on rainy days. 

Doesn't th at make you mad? 
Consider how i 1I0gicaithis ~ ituation 
is - I lind it hard to helieve that ollr 
veni l:ally challenged fri end only car-
ries an umbrella when it rains. Or, if 
he forgets hi s umbrella, why doesn' t 
he just ask someone to push the but -
ton for him'l 

Instead, this guy hauls hi s bUll 
up 36 Ilights of stairs every day?! 

" II 's just a ridd le, Mary," my 
fri end Denise lold me. ·'Relax." 

I have come to the realization that 
I'm disturbed by thi s parahIc 
because, deep down, I think I am the 
midget. 

Not that there is anything uniqu 
about my height. Rather, I'm the 
type who would end up c1imhing 36

For my last act , I pulled all -

Volleyball Says 'Aloha' Track Earns Split 
UP AND DOWN: The Tritons stood together in two losses to Hawaii NICE: The women took ftrst as the men got second 
By Steve Walsh 
Senior Scaff WriCer 

Like night and day. That is the 
best way to describe the two per-
formances hy the men's volleyba ll 
team againM the 

niversity of 
Hawaii last 
week . 

With the Tri -
tons doing their 
best Jckyll -and-
Hyde routine, 
the o. 4 ranked 
Rainbows cer-
tainly didn't know what to expect 
from their hosts hut they did man-
age to keep their composure long 
enough to take both matche~ from 
UCSD. 

The talc of two teams began 
Thursday evening with the Triton~ 
looki ng severe ly overmatched 
against Hawaii . Despite the return 
of senior outsi de hitter Ryan 
Woods to the lineup, the injury 
plague continued to hit U SD as 
junior Devon Jeffcoat was fon.:ed 
out with sboulder problems. 

With the movement in the ros-
ter, Triton Head Coach Dum:an 
McFarland was again forced to 
stan a different six and the chem-
istry appeared to be missing. 

Facing a Rainhow team that 
averaged 6-foot -7 inches across 
the frontline , UCSD found very 
little working in its' fa vor. 

The Tritons strugglcd to find 
any consistency. A number of 

untimely service errors and the big 
hloek of the Rainbows quick ly 
had UCSD down a game, 15-2. 

Game two saw UC D put 
togdhcr a ~tronger olfe n ~ive 
attack. Wood~ and fe llow ~cni or 
Jon Yarris handled the majority of 
the swi ngs for the Tritons hut the 
two could not match the AII -
American fin:power or Hawaii . 

After insening much of their 
bench, the Rainbow~ continued to 
take advanlage of the Triton errors 
and grabbed game two, 15-5. 

With the wi ntl taken from il s 
sai ls, UCSD continued to stru ggle 
in the third game. De,pi te the 
efro rt ~ of senior middle blocker 
Alan Dawher, who anchored the 
Triton frontline and e~LUhlis hcd 
himself as an olTensive and defen -
sive Ihreat, UCSD had no answer 
for the Rainhows .lIlti dropped the 
game and Ihe match, 15-3. 

"Even though the score, were 
heavily in their fa vor, I Ihink that 
we played tough th roughout the 
malch and we rei u .. cd to gi vc liP," 
Mcfarland sa id . 

While Thursday had been the 
darke, t ni ght ror the Tri ton" Fri-
day brought rays 01' , un, hi nc for 
the ~quad ; I~ it took the coun for a 
rematch again ~t Hawaii . 

The Tritons opened game !lne 
looking like the team from Thurs-
day and fo und themselves down 
10- 1. Following a solo hloc l h 
Wood~, though, and an ace by set-
ter Kurt Seckington, CSD stole 

~ome momentum from the Rain -
bows and woke up (()e I.:rowd . 

The Tritons con tinued to side-
out wi lh the Rainhows and slowly 
began 10 I.:hip away at Ihe lead. 
Solo blol:ks by Dawber and Seck-
ington had the Tritons thinking 
upset, hut Hawaii wou ld not fold 
and beld on to game one , 15-9. 

Game two ,aw UCSD take its 
lirst lead of the cries against the 
Rainbows. Servi ce aces hy 
Wood" Yarri s and freshman Zack 
Hite gave the Tritons the lead. 

After call ing a timeout to ~ett l e 
themselves, Ihe Rainhow .. came 
out firing and quick ly era cd the 
lead. The two teams eX l.:hanged 
poinh hut Hawaii retook the lead. 

In an effort ll) regai n momen-
tum, MI.:Farland ca lled a timeout, 
but it was not enough to derai I 
Hawaii as it won, 15-8. 

With the l.: rowd in the matl.:h 
and heckling the Rainbow~, 
UCSD I.:o ntinued to li ght in the 
third gmne, matching point~ with 
Ha waii . 

A, th l.:Y had in the previous 
gJ me~ , the Rainbows were ab le 
.. tnng togl.: ther a ~e ri e, or point ~ 
and build a sll.ahle lead. But wi tb 
the deren ~e ,cramhling after every 
hall , the Trilons reru ,cd to give in 
and an ace by freshman Shane 
MaguJrl: h;ld UCSD ""ithin three. 

That would be a~ I.: lose a~ the 
TrilOn ~ would ge l a ~ Hawaii 
ended If<., sta) ill San Diego with a 
win , IS-X. 

By Saul Sheridan 
Siaff Writer 

It ' ~ early in the season, but a 
few word~ already come to mind 
when de,cribing tbe 1998 CSD 
track and fi eld squad: 
tough. competi tive and 
determined. 

Thi s week 's meet in 
Los Angeles again~t 
CSULA, UC River. ide 
and al Poly Pomona was 
no eXl.:cption, as the 
women won the four-team 
meet and the men linished 
a close ~el.:ond to host CSULA. 

An example of the team 's l.:0111 -
petiveness is icole Rodrigue/ , 
who competed in five evenls on the 
day to help her team to victory. 

"Nicole is our Athlete of the 
Week," Head Coac h Ted Van Ars-
dale said . "Her performance ou t 
there was great. She ran an out-
standing 4:02.6 in the 4x400 rclay 
to lead us to a victory in the event. " 

Mcghan Scot t lurned in anot her 
strong performam:e on the 
women 's :,ide , selling a personal 
record in the 3,()()O l11eter with a 
win ning time or II :06.1. SCOll then 
went on to sc t another personal 
rl.:cord ill the 1,5UO meters en route 
to another first -place linish with a 
time of 5:0 1.3. 

An example of the team 's 
toughness is the perfonnance or 
Danie lle Sl.: hcibli . who had a disap-
pointing linish in the 400-llleter 
hurdles hut then led her team to 

victory with an outstanding 4x400. 
"After Danielle's race in the 400 

hurdles, she had a momenl to 
reflecl and then gave us a great per-
formance in the rclay race," Van 

Arsdale said . "She gave 
the team the propulsion 
necessary to win . That 's 
bei ng a true competit or, 
not letting one bad race 
ruin another." 

On the men's side, 
so lid performances by 
Matt Seel'cld , Vincent 
Geluco and Mike Wallal:e 

led the team to a second-place l'in-
ish in a meet that wasn't decided 
unti I the linal events. 

"The men 's I.:ompetitioo was 
very exciting," Van Arsda le sa id. 
"Three-quarters into the meet, 
there was a three-way tic with us, 
CSULA and Cal Poly Pomona." 

The Tritons got a strong perfor-
mance by Seefeld . He provided the 
team with wme much-needed 
points in the disl.: us and shot put. 

"Matt gave a tremendous per-
fonnancc ," Van Arsdal c sa id . " He 
had a mark of 46 '8" in the shot put ; 
we haven ' t had someone throw 46 
fe ct in si x yea rs." 

" In thi s sport the key to wi nning

UCSD Splits Weekend 
TOUGH: UCSD trampled Division II CSU Dominguez Hills, 
but was sidetracked against powerhouse Claremont College 
By Shahin Rahlmi 
Senior Staff Writer 

Every season when the sched ul es are 
made, the bi g games arc always circled on 
the calendar. But in extreme cases, some-
times the red pen has to extend to a few 
days. Take thi s weekend for 
instance - Head Coach Liz 
LaPlanle had a Di vision II foe and 
a top-5 Di vision III opponent on 
consecutive day s. 

Going into thi s rast weekend 's 
double-dip - Di vision II Cal State 
Dominguez. Hill s visiting on Friday 
and Divi sion III powerhouse Clare-
mont College knocking on Satur-
day - the UCSD women 's tennis team pre-
pared for its toughe t challenge of the 1998 
season. 

It 's not common pral.:tice tcr bailie a 
tough opponent like top-five Claremont 
after an afternoon with a Di vision II schoo l. 
so it was sa fe to say things weren ' t look ing 
good for Ihe Tritons. 

Games aren't played on paper, however. 
So the team took everything in stride 

when the Toros of CSUDH showed up on 
Friday. The Toros may be a di vision ahead 
of UCSD, but they arc in the midst of their 
inaugural women's tennis program. Conse-
quently, the day ended with the Tritons gar-
nering their fourth I.:onsel.:utive win , CS D 
9, CSUDH O. 

The big duel followed on Saturday, a bat-
tic against the Athenas of Claremont. Junior 
J nnifer Dri,mner suffered an ankle injury 
while ahead in the first set. 5-2. She had to 
default her singles match and three of her 
teammates lost their contests in three sets as 
the Tritons fini shed the day with a 6-3 loss 

and a weekend split. 
When the Tritons took to the court s Sat-

urday for the doubles ponion looking for 
another "W." Kirsten Olsen and Maria 
Nguyen - comfortable now that they' re 
playing in the No. I slot - squeaked out a 

9-8 pro-set win over Rosie Cella 
and July Kirkpatrick. 

Claremont, however, came back 
10 grab the last two doubles sets. 
Blair Rubenstein and Sheda Mar-
shall defeated UCSD 's Bel.:ky Jones 
and Robyn Kondrack, whi Ie 
Michelle Parent i and Stacy Fong 
slipped past Drimmer and Kelli 
Tsai. 

"We felt a lillie bit of relief getting one 
win io doubles," Triton Head Coach Li z 
LaPlante said. "Unfortunately, we lost some 
tough singles matches. We' re reall y playing 
well , though. The win at Pomona was ni l.:e 
and it doesn't hun los ing LO a LOp-live Divi-
sion III school." 

Leading 2-1 going into the singles por-
tion of the day, Claremont needed only three 
wins out of six for the mutch. 

Nguyen and Olsen, though, could not be 
stoppcd. Olsen literally dominated Ruben-
stein at the No. I spot in bageling her, 6-0, 
6-0. Nguyen also continued her strong play 
at No. 2, taking a three-set wi n over Cella, 
6-4, 6-7, 6-0. 

Claremont, however, grabbed all the 
other singles contests in three-set fa shion -
excluding the default at No. 6. 

UCSD will have to re-group hefore il 
takes on U.S. International University thi s 
week and three tough opponents the week 
after: Colorado College and St. Louis Uni -
versity and Division I Michigan State.

Men Smash Tigers 
SHUTOUT: UCSD won every match in a run over Occidental 
By Bill Burger 
Siaff Wriler 

It 's a skunk ! Saturday on the MuirCouns 
the UCSD men 's tennis team embaJTassed 
Occidental Co llege. 7-0. The vi ·tory runs 
the Tritons record 10 a perfeel 3-0 
on the yuung season. 

CS D's dominance was ev ident 
from the beg inning as it again 
swept all three doubles pro-sets and 
was awarded the lone point for dou-
bles. The Tritons are yet to lose a 
doubles set thi s yea r, a great 
improvement from last year ' · 
mediOl;re play. 

Steve Shabel and Emil Mihet went up 3-
D early before linding themselves down, 4-
5. Shabel and Mihet rallied from there to 
take the match, 8-5. 

" I just lost my conc.:ntration," Mihet 
said. ';1 couldn' t hit volleys, I couldn 't hit 
overheads, I couldn ' t hil anything." 

The lack of conl.:entration seemed to be a 
uni versal problem for the Tritons bel.:ause of 
their superiorit y over their opponents. 

At No. 2 doubles, Anthony Melicharek 
and Mike Rosset won easi ly, 8-2. They also 
sighted a lal.:k in focus as the weakness of 
their pro-sct. 

Brian Board and Brian Crain had little 
trouhle with their opponents as they cruised 
to an easy 8-2 victory. 

As if the doubles weren't bad enough for 
Occidental. the Tritons did not give up a set 
in singles ror the first time thi s year. Shabel 
won the lirst set at No. I singles. 6-.1. and 
then had a hard time closing out before 
eventually winning the second set, 6-4. 

Jason Hipp lilled in at No. 2 singles 
because of Mihet's shoulder injury and won, 

6-2,6-4 . 
Anthony Melich'lrek played well early 

and then fought off frustration 10 win his 
match at o. 3 singles, 6-1 6-4. 

At o. 4 singles Reggie Brauzon contin-
ued his impressive play after 
returning from injury as he won, 6-
3, 6-0. This match, combined with 
his match against United States 
International Uni versity, tOlals four 
set wins for Brauwn while losing 
only three games. 

Mike Rosset had an easy time at 
No. 5 singles as he dominated from 
beginning to end to win, 6-1, 6-2. 

Vincent Darmoshusado also dominated 
his opponent in an easy 6-2, 6-2 victory. 

Despite the easy win, Coach Brian Turn-
er was cautious after the match. 

"That was al.:ceplable despite our lack of 
fol.:us ," Turner said. "If we lose our focus 
against Santa Cruz the matdl will probably 
be over." 

Turner expressed I.:o nl.:e rn about the 
many nagging injuries that arc plaguing his 
players. Mihet had to sit out his singles 
Inatch due to his injury and Dan Albrecht 
had to sit out because of an elbow injury. 
However, it appears that Shabel 's early-sea-
son stomach injury is now healed and Jason 
Hipp's tendonitis seems to be bothering him 
less with every matdl . 

The much-anticipated matches against 
Redlands University and UCSC arc still a 
wuple of weeks away, but the Tritons 
shou ld have an eXl.:iling match on Friday 
against Division I Boston College. B.C. 
attracts eXl.:ellent players because it provides 
sl.:holarships, and the Eagles should prove to 
be UCSD's toughest opponent to date.

Baseball Crushes Crusaders, Beats Eagles 
TWO IN A ROW: The Tritons found success at 
home, beating both Point Lorna and Concordia 
By John Maynard 
Staff WfIler 

bn ' t It nice to he home aga in '! 
n Saturday, the Tritons ho~ t ed 

onw rdia U ni ver~ it y on 
their own turf - their fir~ t 
home ga me in over a 
lIlont h. 

Aft er llIore than 30 days 
of re lentless rai n tha t 
turm:d the Triton basehall 
fi eld into the Florida ver-
glades, the sun fi nall y 
stayed out long enough to 
dry up the swampy mess. 

Allhough the lield was a little 
hit s lippery, it wa~ still pl ayahlc, 
and UCSD ca me out ready to 
defend it!Y sod. 

After a convincing win on 
Thursday, when the Tritons blew 
out Point Loma Nazarene College 
15-4, UCSD was hoping to take 
down the Eagles of oncordia for 
its first back-to-back wins of the 
season. 

Thursday 's stqmping gave the 
Tritons confidence. 

"After the Biola loss on 
Wednesday, each player looked 
inside themselves," Triton head 
coa(;h . Dan 0' Brien said. "We 
know we're a good team. On 
Thursday, we went out on the field 

to take care of hu ... ine~~. ow we 
know we (;an go a~ far al, we want 
to go. Jt \ up to each indi vidual. " 

Each player ~ t e pped up Satur-

inning. the Tri t () n ~ 
charged to the plate in the 
hottolll 01 the sewnd and 
littered the licld wi th 5

Trit on catcher Jc~~ Warrington 
~ t a rted off the scoring, as hi ~ line-
dri ve shot to left center scored 2 for 
UCSD. With two outs and two men 
on base, junior Kenny Fluharty 
knocked in another pair of runs on 
a huge triple to the gap in ri ght cen-
ter. 

Senior short stop Mark Mason, 
who had a huge game Thursday 
against Point Lorna with ~ homers 
and 5 RBis, added to the UCS D 
attack, driving in the fifth run of the 
inning for the Tritons. 

Allhough the Eagles were able 
to hring 2 runs across the plate in 
the top of the third, the Tritons 
answered, scoring another run in 
the bottom half of the inning. 

Dave Pilz/ Guardlan 
Safe: An unknown assailant from UCSD gets down and makes a successful slide into third base , 
easily beating the throw. UCSD cleaned up , 8-6, behind a strong outing from pitcher Theo Robins. 

Warrington slapped hi s second 
hit of the game, dri ving in first 
baseman Eric Pange linan. Warring-
ton lini shedthe game going 2 for 4 
with 3 RBis. He also had a strong 
performance behind the plate, 
th rowing out a Concordi a runner 
stea ling second to help get the Tri -
tons out of a jam in the top of the 
lifth. 

Speaking of strong perfor-
mances, UCSD starter Theo Robins 
was on top of hi s game, going 
eight-and-two-thirds innings for 

the Tritons. Through eight innings, 
Robins gave up only 3 runs on 4 
hits. 

' 'Theo reall y stepped up today," 
0 ' Brien said . 

Robins struggled 10 d ose the 
game in the top of the ninth , allow-
ing 3 more runs. Junior Eri c 
Schramm, though, came in from 
ri ght lieldto take the mound, strik-
ing out the final Eagle batter, earn-
ing himself the save and keeping 
the win for Robins. 

With their 8-6 victory, the Tri -

tons improve to 5-6 on the season, 
and look forward to again defend-
ing their own turf as they wait for 
their matchup aga inst Moravian 

ollege (Pa.) thi s Friday. 
"The players take a lot of pride 

in the fi eld ," 0 ' Brien said . "We tell 
ourse lves that nobody comes into 
our yard and dictates." 

While the Tritons wait for Fri -
day's matchup against Moravian, 
they will step into Cal Lutheran 's 
yard on Tuesday, hoping to make it 
three wins in a row. 

Men's Basketball Finishes Season .Strong Women To 
Host NCAA 
Tournament 

FINALE: The Tritons 
lost to UC Santa Cruz, 
but crushed Menlo 
By Kevin McLauJhlln 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

And so the campaign doses. 
The UCSD men's basketball team's 
'97-'98 season is over follow ' 
split this weekend at home 
against UC Santa Cruz and 
Menlo College. 

Though the men fell 
short of their preseason 
goal of reaching the Divi -
sion III NCAA Tourna-
ment, their 18-7 record is a 
testament to a season of 
perseverance, hard work 
and, ultimately, a lot of winning. 

Friday night , the men played as 
if they knew the end was ncar. Fol -
lowing their sixth loss of the season 
last weekend to Christian Heritage, 
the men were very likely to be shut 
out of the playoffs despite earning 
Honorable Mention r .. "king in the 
Division IfI West Region. 

Thus, the men seemed rather 
nonchalant .against an opponent 
they had squeaked by earlier in the 
year in overtime, and they paid the 
price in losing to UCSC, 74-64. 

Poor shooting and a 9-rebound 
dclicit to the shorter Banana Slugs 
spelled the Tritons ' doom . In 
pUlling out their most meager scor-

total of the season, the men hit 
on just 19 percent of their 
three-pointers. 

Down 5 at the half, the 
men rallied to take a com-
fortable lead early in the 
second half. Tyler Field 
carried his end of the bar-
gain all night, scoring 3 
points on 15 of 19 shoot-
ing, but could lind no one 

else to help the cause. 
The Slugs, behind 8 blocked 

shots for the game and some capa-
hie passing, stormed back in the 
late minutes to take a lead they 
wouldn ' t relinquish, beating UCSD 
for only the second time in the 2 1 
meetings between the two schools.

sluggish and we couldn ' t tum it 
on," sophomore forward Mike 
McMillan said. "We didn 't start 
like we did Saturday night." 

Saturday night was indeed an 
entirely different game for the Tri -
tons as they came out shooting con-
fidently against their old chopping 
blocks, the Oaks of Menlo. The 
Oaks fell at the Bunyan-like hands 
of the Tritons, 121 -86. 

In the last game of senior guard 
Mark Sebek's career, the whole 
team got in on the action. 

Sebek led seven Tritons in dou-
ble figures with 17 points. For-
wards Mike Wall , Ryan Howley 
and Sam Hi ggins each had 16, Hig-
gins freshly returned from an injury 
and Howley hilling an impressive 7 
of 7 shots from the Iloor. 

The play of all Ihree of these 
forwards will be key to the Tritons 
next year. The team returns all it s 
.players but the lone soldier, Sebek, 
and should make another strong bid 
for th postseason. 

Guard Adam Libby got husy

Baseball 
The Tritons will be on

they face off in Thou-

assists in 20 minutes of action. The 
game itself was a laugher from the 
tip, with UCSD quickly building a 
double-digit lead that would only 
grow throughout the night. 

The h~pless Oaks committed 25 
turnovers on the game to the Tri -
tons' minuscule 6, and allowed 
UCSD to fire up 90 shots, 23 more 
than Menlo. The dominance of 
UCSD was complete, as illustrated 
in the final score. 

The high score was appropriat.e 
for the Tritons, who finished the 
season averaging 97 points per 
game, second in the nation in Divi -
sion III. The men were also second 
in the nation in three-pointers made 
each game, hilling around 14 per 
outing. 

However, what was a successful 
season may he rememhered as a 
year of what-ifs. 

"Mayhe it was a success ful sea-
son in terms of wins and losses, but 
we lost some close games we real -
ly should ha ve won," McMillan 
said . ''Those early season losses 
hurt us."

BALLIN': Women to 
host No. 8 Cal Lu 
By Jeff Bassett 
Sports Writer 

March Madness is coming to 
UCSD. That's right, this Wed., 
March 4the women's basketball 
team will host its NCAA Divi-
sion III first-round matchup at 
RIMAC Arena at 7 p.m. 

The Tritons' opponent will 
he California Lutheran, and the 
numbers suggest that our 
women will emerge victorious. 

Ca l Lu compiled a 
respectable 17-7 record , but 
UCSD closed out the year with 
a 15-game winning streak , its 
22-3 record the best in school 
hi story. Furthermore, UCSD is 
ranked No. 3 in the Western 
reg ion, five spots ahead of 
eighth-ranked Cal Lu. 

The Triton 's biggest advan-
tage: they' re at home, and it 's 
up to us to make it meaningful. 

It 's time to pack the house, 
rai se the roof, whatever. It 's 
been done before, and with very 
sati sfactory result s (the 
women 's volleyball team n w 
has an N AA <.: hampionship 
trophy). 

So mark it down: March 
Madness, and your very own 
blue C4)t , await.
