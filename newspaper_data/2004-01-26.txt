Students protest hate 
speech on Library Walk 

Passersby shred new issue of The Koala 
By VLADIMIR KOGAN 

Senior Staff Writer 
More than 100 people signed 

petitions urging elected student 
leaders and campus administra-
tors to take steps against hate 
speech as part of the demonstra-
tion on Library Walk that lasted 
the course of the day on Jan. 22. 
It was organized to coincide with 
the distribution of The Koala. 

"We're just here as student 
leaders, students especially con-
cerned [with] stopping this recre-
ational hate that's going on our 
campus," said Thurgood Marshall 
College senior Viet Tran, who 
helped plan the demonstration. 
"We want to get the wheel going, 
to take a stance for something cre-
ative against this injustice. I think 
it's just a first step, raising the idea 
that we're against it and that we 
won't stand for it." 

Tran and several others set up 
a table with a paper shredder 
next to several distributors and 
urged passing students to shred 
their copies of the paper. The 
table also included newspapers

Student association 
sues governor 

UCSA, others file lawsuit 
claiming executive order illegal 

By MEAGHAN FIELD 
Staff Writer 

The UC Student Association, 
the Equal Justice Society, 
Californians for Justice and indi-
vidual students filed a lawsuit 
against Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger on Jan. 21. The 
plaintiffs allege that the governor's 
executive order to rescind the vehi-
cle licensing fee violates state laws 
and oversteps the boundaries of 
the executive branch by removing 
decisions regarding budget from 
the legislature. 

"The lawsuit came from the 
three organizations coming 
together on common issues, which 
were access to higher education 
and the threats that the cuts pro-
duced," Matt Kaczmarek, chair of 
UCSA and UCLA Vice President 
External, said. "The availability of 
pro-bono legal counsel presented 
a viable option to folJow through 
with the lawsuit." 

The California Revenue and 

Taxation Code section 10754 
states that the fee can be lowered 
as long as there is sufficient money 
in the general fund to cover the 
offset. According to the petition 
for writ of mandate, the governor 
violated state law by repeaJing the 
fee when there was not enough 
money in the state's general fund 
to compensate for the consequent 
lack of funding. The petition 
alleges that the repeal of the fee 
created a state of emergency, 
which the governor then used to 
make cuts he would not ordinari-
ly be able to make, and that it is 
the job of the legislature to make 
cuts when necessary. 

"There are two major reasons 
why these cuts are illegal ," said 
A.S. Vice President External 
Harish Nandagopal, who is a 
UCSA board member. 

The first, he said, was that 
there was not enough money in 
the general fund to cover the cuts.

UCSB contributes to Mars 
Rover expedition 

Materials used to shield vital components of 
the Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity during 
atmospheric entry, which were tested and cer-
tified by a UC Santa 8arbara research grouP, . 
successfully withstood atmospheric into 
Martian atmosphere on Jan. 3 and Jan. 25, 
respectively. 

Mechanical and environmental engineering 
and materials professor Frederick Milstein led 
the research ~roup, which spent a year certify-
ing the matenal's structural integrity for use in 
space. He received special recognition in the 
form of a certificate from NASA for 'outstand-
ing performance and lasting contribution to the 
success of the Mars Exploration Rover Project" 

The materia I, specially created for the mis-
sion by NASA, is known as SIRCA, for 'silicone 
impregnated reusable ceramic ablator.' 
During its research, Milstein's group found 
that SIRCA is highly anisotropic, meaning it 
reacts in different ways when stressed in aif-
ferent directions. NASA engineers created the 
material, which is light gray and has one-
fourth the density of water, by taking silica 
fibers and adding silicone liquid. Milstein's 
group discovered that when stressed in one 
direction, the material gives a little before 
holding its shape. However, when stress is 
applied against the grain of the silica fibers, 
the matenal crumbles. 

Without Milstein's certification, NASA would 
have been obliged to redesign the rovers or 
cancel the mission altogether. 

Milstein has worked with NASA on similar 
materials for the last five years.

Stuart: New sculpture in works 
continued from page I 

about 300 tons and measuring 22 feet in 
height. The bear will be built in the middle 
of a quad at the Jacobs School of 
Engineering. 

"It will really be quite a complex engi-
neering challenge," said Jane Zwerneman, 
program director of the Stuart Collection. 

According to Zwerneman, the engi-
neering school will participate in the con-
Struction of the sculpture and help to 
arrange how the pieces will be held togeth-
er. 

Later this year, the eight separate 
stones that comprise the piece will be col-

lectively moved to the UCSD campus, 
where Hawkinson will combine them into 
the finished bear form. . 

The proposal for this sculpture was sanc-
tioned by the Stuart Collection 
International Advisory Committee before 
being approved by UCSD administration. 

According to Zwerneman, the Stuart 
Collection is constantly on the lookout for 
potential artists and invites them to the 
UCSD campus to explore prospective sites 
for a sculpture.

Protest: Organizers say Koala 'not target' 
continued from page I 

organizers said publishers donat-
ed as "alternative reading mater-
ial. " 

Originally !.Cheduled for the 
previous day, student organizers 
postponed the event after learn-
ing that The Koala would come 
Ollt a day late. The purpose of the . 
rally was not to exclusively target 
the The Koala, according to 
Thurgood Marshall College 
Student Council Chair Travis 
Silva, who helped coordinate the 
demonstration. 

"Our forum was really intend-
ed to target hate speech. It was not 
to target The Koala,» said Silva, 
who framed the publication as 
especially symbolic. "The only 
institutionalized form of hate 
speech is The Koala, though that's 
not to say it's not the only type of 
hate speech." . 

The 12-page edition of The 
Koala included a swastika symbol 
on the front cover. 

"The swastikas were enough 
for me," said Earl Warren 
College freshman Dominique 
Martinez, who put her copy 
through the shredder and signed 
the petition. "[1 shredded it) 
because of the Nazi symbols [and) 
because I'm against that. I'm 
Hispanic and I'm very proud of it. 
) don't find interest in any dis-
crimination whatsoever." 

Other students chose not to 
support the rally. . 

")'m against shredding The 
Koala. It's too much like book 
burning," said Thurgood Marshall 
College senior Chris Etow, who 
said he understood why some 
found the newspaper offensive. ") 
think [it) is a funny publication. 
They are constructive by testing 
the limits."

John Muir College senior Mike 
Nitzani said he was not bothered 
by the demonstration or the 
destruction of the paper. 

"I think it's unintentionally 
funny. We even put jokes in The 
Koala about shredding it," he said, 
adding that only a few of the 800 
copies he handed out ended up in 
pieces. "They're having people 
come up one by one, so obviously 
they're not having much of an 
impact." 

After receiving permission from 
organizers, Nitzani put a nearby 
copy of the Califonlia Rwiew 
through the shredder. 

Nitzani claimed Thurgood 
Marshall College administration 
had provided logistical assistance 
for the anti-hate protesters. 

Silva said that neither the 
Thurgood Marshall Student 
Council nor the college admi nis-
tration officially sanctioned or 

supported the event. 
Ashanti Houston Hands, 

Thurgood Marshall College dean 
of student affairs, also denied the 
charge. 

"As the dean, if there were 
questions and concerns about how 
to make sure the event was consis-
tent with policies, I was able to 
answer them," she said. "However, 
at the end, the event was com-
pletely student-run and orga-
nized." 

Students who coordinated the 
rally said that they hope to consol-
idate the support for their cause 
into a new student organization 
committed to opposing hate 
speech. 

"We're trying to strive for a 
hate-free campus," Thurgood 
Marshall College freshman and

more open."

tech new quad in the engineering 
school. There's a lot of contrast 
there." 

The granite bear is the six-

The UCSD and Stuart

1982 with the aim of enriching the 
cultural, intellectual and scholarly 
life of the UCSD campus and of 
the San Diego community by 

building and maintaining site-spe-
cific works of art. 

While some students said they 
found the public art exhibits on 
campus pleasing, others said they 
thought that the upcoming addi-
tion was unnecessary. 

"We already have a lot of 
buildings that catch the eye. It 
seems like a wastc of energy, 
money and space," Eleanor 
Roosevelt College sophomore 
Natasha Cridler said. "I feel like 
they could do something more 
useful, something that could be 
used by the students."

Boy \\1 t ~ rom Balboa 
San Diego City Council's decision 

protects ' individual freedom 
The issue isn't about whether the Boy Scouts of America are a good organization or a bad organiza-
tion, and it isn't even really about homo-
phobia or religious zeal. The 
Jan. 8 decision by the San 

with both organiza-
tions. And it is the 
same principle 
that must be 

,Diego City Council to cancel 
its lease with the Boy Scouts 
for Camp Balboa at Balboa 
Park is an issue of protecting 
individual freedom. PRO 

The Boy Scouts should 
know better than most 
about the importance of 
separating public and private organiza-
tions. It was only a few years ago that 
the Supreme Court decided that 
because the Boy Scouts of America is a 
private insrirution, they have the right 
to incorporate religion into their activ-
ities and ideology. They were even 
found to have the right to exclude 
homosexuals from leadership positions. 

However, it was JUSt in August that a 
federal judge ruled against the Boy 
ScoutS in a case brought by the 
American Civil Liberties Union, decid-
ing that the city of San Diego cannot 
lease public land to a group that discrim-
mates against homosexuals and those 
who do not believe in God. 

The defining issue that enabled the 
court to rule in favor of the ACLU wa 
whether the lease extension gave a pref-
erence or a special benefit to a "religious 
organization." The city'S defense of the 
case rested on the position that, while 
the Boy Scouts may follow certain reli-
gious principles, it was not a "religious 
organization" subject to the restrictions 
in the state and federal constitutions. 

But during the course of the case, the 
Boy Scouts admitted in court documents 
that it was in fact a "religious orb'aniza-
tion." Based upon that admission, Federal 
District Judge Napoleon Jones deter-
mined that the lease was invalid because 
the process by whicli it was extended vio-
lated both the state and federal constitu-
tions in providing special preference and 
benefits to a religious organi7.ation. 

Under current law, no public entity 
can provide special preference or bene-
fits to a religious organization, whether a 
church, a mosque, a synagogue or a 
you th group. Although religious organi-
zations can indeed lease public property 
and obtain other government benefits, 
they must do so on equal terms with 
other potential leasees. 

In a sense, this case is not only about 
previous decisions that have been made, 
but also about decisions to be made in 
the future. Allowing Boy Scouts to sing 
songs around the campfire in San Diego 
was obviously not the hot issue concern-
ing the framers of the Constitution. But 
they were concerned about a public 
office giving preference to one religious 
organization or another. 

There's an on-campus example of 
protecting individual freedom at the cost 
of what might seem like common sense. 
Tbe Koala has spent the past few years 
publishing a newspaper that many find at 
best disrespectful and crude. But they 
are allowed to continue printing because 
they are protected under the Fi rst 
Amendment's guarantee of the freedom 
of the press. Although it might seem that 
there are few pairs as disparate as the 
staff of the Koala and the Boy Scout 
troop at Camp Balboa, it is the same 
principle that directs public interaction 

upheld in this 
sion . 

The 
Boy Scouts 
of America 
is a private 
organiza-
tion with 
professed 
religious 
aspects -
its pledge 
includes a 
pledge to 
God 
and docu-
mented 
instances of 
discrilnination 
toward openly 
homosexual 
men. Those 
asserti{)ns 
shouldn't (lVer-
shadow the orga-
nization's philan-
thropic and posi-
tive capabilities. 
This is an orga-
nization that 
generates 
unity among 
young men, 
instills beliefs 
in together-
ness and fos-
ters friend-
srups. It's an 
organization 
that has dor.e a 
lot of good things 
for a lot of indi-
viduals. But none 
of that matters as 
far upholding the 
division between 
church and state. 

It's impossible 
and contradictory 
to attempt to pick 
and choose who 
should be pro-
tected under the 
Fir s t 
Amendment. 
It's impossible 
to protect The 
Nnv York Times 
without also protecting the Aryan Narian, 
and it's impossible to protect the Boy 
Scouts of America without also protecting 
the Ku Klux Klan. 

The uniformity of freedom regard-
less of belief is the inherently beautiful 
concept of the Bill of Rights, but it 
works both ways. And to paraphrase 
Thomas Jefferson, it's only when that 
freedom is limited - perhaps even with 
the best of intentions - that it will be 
entirely lost.

The Left 

is only inter-
ested in ask-

ing why a non-
secular agenda should be 

entitled to government assis-
tance. But why should a federally recog-
nized non-profit organization be denied 
the privileges entitled to other such 
groups based solely upon its religious 
practices? Since the freedom to prac-
tice religion is explicitly protected by 
the First Amendment, discrimina-
tion against a group for religious 
reasons would be no different than 
the establishment of a state church. 

Discrimination is discrimination; 
the Left can't have it both ways. 

First of aU, the Boy Scouts of 
Ame.rica is a federally recog-

nized non-profit organization 
- which receives tax breaks 

- because it performs a 
valuable ser-
vice across 
the country. 

Its primary 
purpose is to 

instill con-

and maturity in our 
nations youth. According to 
the Scout Law, the members of 
its organization are mentored to be 
trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, 
courteous, lcind, obedient, cheerful, 
thrifty, brave, clean and reverent. Not 
a bad deal at all; most parents would 
be happy to have their son join. 

Oh, that's right, the Boy Scouts have a 
moral code that doesn't permit them to admit 
homosexuals and atheists. If you don't like 
that, don't join; they set their own rules, and 
it'd be wrong to try to impose your will upon 
them. The ACLU already tried to force such a 
change, but lost. In Boy Scouts of Amnicll v. 
Dille, the Supreme Court ruled the Scouts' 
freedom of expressive association trumped 
New Jersey's public accommodations statute, 
thereby permitting membership requirements 
based upon Scout Law. 

Since that strategy didn't work in its favor, 

Association and the Presbyterian Church. Some 
are secular, some aren't; however, they are all 
non-profit organizations providing various ser-
vices to help the conununity. Why is it fair to 
discriminate against the Boy Scouts because of 
their moral standards? 

The Boy Scouts' public service overwhelm-
ingly ourweighs any hurt feelings resulting from 
its recruitment policies, especially since there are 
other youth organizations that welcome gays 

and atheists. Does that mean the Boy Scouts 
don't need public assistance? No. There are 
5 million Boy Scouts nationwide because 
they and their parents appreciate the unique 
values the organization has to offer. If the 
government could no longer aid such orga-
nizations, membership fees would increase 
dramatically, and many Americans - espe-
cially low-income parents - simply could 
not afford it. 

This is not to encourage government 
promotion of religious groups over secu-
lar groups, but 
instead, equal 
treatment. If 
secular non-
profit organi-
zations are 

allowed spe-
cial treatments 

denied to reli-
gious non-profits, 
then the govern-
ment is clear-
ly discrimi-
nating 
against the 
religiou's 
groups, and that's 
unconstitutional. 

Now, before 
falling back to the 
ba ttl e cry of, 
"Separation of 
church and state!" 
as apF~ to be the norm, closely 
examine the First Amendment, its 

intent and the history of its enforcement. In 
doing so, you'U quickly discover that it 

was not intended to create a secular 
society in which government 

does not interact with reli-
gious organizations, but 

to ensure that govern-
ment does not 

"establish" a state 
religion, or "pro-

lubit" the people from practicing it. 
Even a casual glance at the Boy Scouts makes 

it readily apparent that neither is the case here. 
The idea of separation of church and state was 
first advocated by Thomas Jefferson, not in the 
Bill of Rights, but in an essay, which has no legal 
implications whatsoever. Its application to the 
Constitution is simply wishful thinking by our 
friends on the Left. 

Moreover, however appalling it may be that 
the city of San Diego has acquiesced to the

MONDAY, JANUARY 26, 2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Howard Dean's wife deserves your vote 

Big Sister 
Claire J. Vannette 

D eanheads, Deany Babies, Dean-and-Che~ Burritos 
- whatever you call them, 

I'm officially one of them. If for-
mer Vermont Gov. Howard Dean 
is still in the race in March and 
appears on my Democratic presi-
dential primary ballot, I'U vote for 
him. 

But not for any of the reasons 
you might think. 

It has nothing to do with 
Deans stance on the issues. I don't 
favor rus record, his speaking style, 
his fasruon sense. Nor is it his 
allegedly inspiring passion and 
fire, epitomized in last week's red-
faced ranting (which one friend 
called a "primal scream," but I 
prefer to think of as a "barbaric 
yawp"). I really couldn't say 
whether or not he'd make a better 
president than Kerry, Clark or 
Edwards. 

Despite my apathy toward the 
candidate, I will check his box. But 
I won't be voting for the man for 
president. I'll be voting for his wife 
for first lady. 

Don't tell my boyfriend. but I 
have a huge freakin' crush on 
Judith Steinberg Dean - and ( 
think shes exactly what this coun-
try needs in a President's wife. 

Reason one: Its right in the 
name. Judith SUillberg Dean -
she's Jewish, and so are the Deans' 
twO children. Howard may be 
Episcopalian, but Dean's election 
wotrld give me White House 

menorah-lightings. I'm not Jewish 
(though I play one at seder and 
Shabbat); I just get a kick out of 
the image of Hebrew echoing 
through the halls of the West 
Wing. 

Reason two: She's a doctor, and 
apparently a very good one. 
Neither a homemaker nor a polit-
ical schemer, she's a professional 
who commands respect. 

Reason three: Though she's an 
attractive woman, she rarely wears 

" 

ing them in a way that other first 
ladies couldn't or wouldn't, that it's 
OK for their desires and aspira-
tions to remain primary. 

Essentially, I love the idea of 
Judy Dean as our first lady because 
she completely rejects the tradi-
tional first lady role - painted, 
submissive, benign, ornamental 
and deeply anti-feminist - with-
out crossing into the manipulative 
(if exciting) Hillary territory. 
Whether as rus most beautiful 

accessory or his 
power-grabbing 
rival, first ladies 
have always bet:n 

makeup or jewelry 
and favors casual 
clothes over the 
tight- bu ttoned. 
suits of first ladies 
past and present. 
I'm not terribly 
interested in the 
paragons of first-
lady femininity, 
like Jackie 0 or 
Rosalynn Carter. 

As first lady, Judy 
Dean would be an 
excellent role model 
far girls and young 

Iluxilary to the 
President. They 
live for him or 
through him. Judy 
Dean would do 
neither with 
Howard, it seems. 

Maybe I'm 
Reason four 

(and this is the big 
one): She refuses 
to p~t her career 
on hold because of 
her husband's 
political aspira-
tions. She hasn't 
been out there 
until recently on 
the campaign trail, 
glowing at her 
husband in hopes 
that voters will 
love him as much 

women, showing 
them in a way that 

other first ladies 
couldn't ar wouldn't, 
that it's OK far their 

desires and 

being unfair. I do 
have a lot of 
respect for our 
former first ladies, 
and they have 
done good work 
drawing attention 
to whatever issues 
sparked their 
interest. And 
maybe I'm going a 
Ii ttle overboard 
with my love for 
Judy Dean. But I 
think it can be 

aspirations to remain 
primary, " 

as she does; she has a medical prac-
tice to tend to, patients to care for. 
She has said that if Howard is 
elected, she will continue practic-
ing medicine. Unfeasible? 
Perhaps. But I find it a wonderful 
expression of contemporary femi-
nism. As first lady, Judy Dean 
would be an excellent role model 
for girls and young women, show-

understood in two ways. 
First: It would be an absurd 

understatement to say that I had a 
feminist upbringing. My mom 
dragged me to women's festivals, 
the kind where guitars are 
strummed, granola is consumed, 
New Age crystals are sold and 
breasts in dire need of bra support 
are displayed joyfully as women -

or should I say "womyn" - romp 
in freedom from the male gaze. 

I keep the bra on, thanks, and 
prefer Lil' Kim to Joni Mitchell, 
but nonetheless developed in this 
environment a sense that women 
are entitled to a space and a self 
separate from men. No matter 
how much they may love the men 
in their lives (wruch is not to say 
that all of these bare-chested 
women had, ahem, mm in their 
lives), they didn't feel obligated to 
center their existences on them. 

Second: I have undergone a 
rapid and bitter political disillu-
sionment over the last four years. 
Though at age six I dialed for 
Democrat Michael Dukakis in 
Nickelodeon's call-in "Kids Vote"; 
though the highlight of my wide-
eyed ten-year-old life was, in the 
hot summer of 1992, the moment 
I shook Bill Clinton's hand; 
though I ,railed against Bob Dole 
to my rugh school friends; though 
I had butterOies in my stomach as 
I registered to vote just after turn-
ing 18; I am now jaded. 

The 2000 presidential election 
disappointed me deeply, and 
turned my youthful idealism into 
sour resentment. The Democratic 
Party was foundering; all politi-
cians were prostitutes; not one of 
them was worth my ballot. With 
every passing election, I grew 
more and more cynical about 
American politics, and by the time 
the recall rolled around, the only 
reason I voted a t a II was beca use a 
buddy was running for governor. 

But in my heart, amid the 
vaguely Marxist indicrments of our 
so-called democracy and the well-
founded suspicion of anyone run-
ning for office, is the six-year-old. 
She is awed by candidates, voting,

ACLU on a case they'd inevitably 
win in die Supreme Court, it was 
downright incompetent to pay 
them $9;0,000 in the process for 
"legal fees." Here we have our fire 
department having to petition the 
voters for more money and talks of 
paying city workers a $12-per-hour 
minimum wage, and the city gives 
away almost $1 million dollars to a 
non-profit organization. Worse yet, 
only Councilman Brian Madaffer 
joined Mayor Dick Murphy in dis-
sent. Coincidentally, all three coun-
cil members indicted on bribery 
charges from the Cheetah's strip 
club incident voted in favor of the

Fiscally, this makes no sense. A 
settlement would be in order if the 
city had no case, but this litigation 
has been pending for three years; 
did it really take that long to exam-
ine the situation? And since the 
U.S. Department of Justice is now 
siding with the Scouts, the cityi> 
case had at least a little legitimacy. 

However, the fiscal situation is 
further convoluted by the Boy 
Scouts' payment of several million 
dollars for park improvements, 
including a $1.7 million payment 
due in March - which the city 
tactlessly reminded them of on the 
day of the settlement. Should the 
Boy Scouts find themselves on the 
street, they'd surely demand reim-
bursement, and that would really 
hurt the taxpayers .

m I LETIERS TO THE EDITORS 
Cultural graduations 
violate A.S. bylaws 

Editor: 
As we approach spring quarter, 

it becomes time again to congratu-
late our friends and role models as 
they graduate and enter the real 
world. We want to make this a spe-
cial time for those students who 
have put so much effort and strug-
gle into earning a UC degree. 
Graduation should be a time for 
friends and family to join together 
to recognize these students for all 
of their hard work. 

But there are numerous other 
events held each year for graduat-
ing seniors that, while I don't chal-
lenge their effectiveness in recog-
nizing and appreciating these stu-
dents, do seem to promote an 
atmosphere of exclusivity and iso-
lation among the myriad cu ltural 
groups on this campus. 

Last year, the A.S. Council allo-
cated $8,000 to fund six different 
cultural graduations. These ranged 
from the Asian Pacific-Islander 
Student Alliance and Movimiento 
Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan 
senior lY.mquets to the LGBT grad-
uation. While these events may pro-
vide a much more intimate and per-
sonal graduation feel, they come as a 
slap in the face to any group which 
does not hold its own graduation. 
Its like saying "Hey, we worked 
harder than you here, so we should 
get a special ceremony!" When one 
closely and objectively analyzes what 
it takes to earn a diploma, one may 
only conclude - it's hard. No mat-
ter who you are, where you come 
from, or who your friends have 
been, we've all had to pull all-
nighters and toss back a couple of 
Red Bulls to get the job done. 

We all should be recognized 
and feel rewarded for getting 
through this, and I don't think any 
one cultural group necessarily has 
to work harder than another to get 
through (getting here, on the other 
hand, is a different story) . 

Also, these events violate a 
whole slew of A.S. bylaws regard-
ing things we cannot allocate stu-
dent money for. We never allocate 
for things like food, permanent 

Con: ACLU 
lacks the Boy 
Scouts' moral 
conduct code 

continued from page 5 
Finally, it's clear that the Boy 

Scouts possess one major asset the 
ACLU lacks: morals. In reciting 
the Scout Oath, they pledge to do 
their "duty to God and country 
". To hel p other people at all 
times; To keep physically strong, 
mentally awake, and mornlly 
straight." Say what you want 
about them, but that hardly 
sounds like the marking of a bad 
person to me. 

Conversely, the ACLU is the 
same organization that in 2000 
defended the North America 
Man-Boy Love Association, 
whose purpose is to teach 
pedophiles how to molest young 
boys. In other words, the Boy 
Scouts want to teach young boys 
to be good, moral citizens, while 
the ACLU is interested in pro-
recting perverts who want to 
molest them. That alone gives 
clairvoyance to San Diego ACLU 
Executive Director Linda Hills' 
twisted comparison of the Boy 
Scouts to the Ku Klux Klan . 

Ironically, morals are exactly 
what the ACLU is suing the Boy 
Scouts for. But regardless of the 
final outcome, the SCOllts will 
alwa)'S have morals, and the ACLU 
will always begrudge them for it. 

equipment, banners or decora-
tionS, and also awards or honors. 
Also, it is strictly against our bylaws 
to allocate to an event which is not 
open to all students. Not only are 
these seniors-only events, they are 
also exclusive in culture. A total of 
six bylaws would need to be sus-
pended to fund these events. These 
bylaws are there for a reason; we 
should respect them. 

Most importanr, lets make sure 
we're not promotillg racism by 
holding an isolationist event. Sure, 
these graduation events are techni-
call y open to all seniors, bu t would 
a student feel comfortable going to 
a special ceremony held for a group 
different from his or her own eth-
nic identity' 

History has shown us time and 
again that segregation promotes 
fear of differences and ev'entually 
racism. Let's promote campus (and 
community) unity by showing that 
we are proud to graduate with 
everyone in our class. Our gradua-
tions will mean that much more 
with the support and attendance of 
everyone in the graduating class . I 
ask the A.S. Counci l to please sup-
port legislation to reconsider the 
current $8,000 allocation to these 
restrictive and counter-progressive 
events.

Some of my friends, real

Dean has restored their faith in 
politics. I can't say I understand 
that. But for me, Judy Dean has

for an election I was sure I'd

Online voting questioned 
veB study finds system vulnerable to hackers 

By KIM-MAl CurLER 
Doily Californian (UC Berkeley) 
(U-WIRE) BERKELEY, 

Calif.- A team of computer sci-
entists that included a UC 
Berkeley professor warned on Jan . 
21 that a $22 million Internet vot-
ing system for overseas military 
personnel slated to be launched in 
less than two weeks is so vulnerable 
to hackers that it should be dis-
carded. 

The system, called Secure 
Electronic Registration and 
Voting Experiment, is slated to be 
up and running in time for the 
South Carolina primary election 
Feb. 3. It could handle up to 
100,000 votes from seven states 
tl,js year. 

But the team of cyber-security 

experts, including UC Berkeley 
computer science professor David 
Wagner, reported that there was no 
way to resolve the security weak-
nesses of the system and the risks 
inherent to Internet voting. 

"The repon doesn't just say this 
is vaguely dangerous. We actually 
name half a dozen serious attacks 
and how they could be perpetrated, 
compromising elections in ways 
that you wouldn't know that they 
happened," said David Jefferson, a 
researcher at the UC-managed 
Lawrence Livermore National 
Laboratory. 

With Internet voting, hackers 
could create programs to observe 
or block votes. Virus programs 
could erase or modify votes as well. 

But U.S. Department of 
Defense officials are backing the 

program, saying the team exagger-
ated the security risks. 

Developed for more than a year 
with the support of a major compa-
ny, Accenture, S.E.R.V.E. was 
designed to help overseas U .S. citi-
zens vote in elections. 

Eventually, the Defe!1se 
Department plans to extend the 
program to all eligible voters in the 
United States. -

However, the team reported 
that while the system may work in 
small-seale test runs, at full usage 
the risks are too great. 

"We recognize that no security 
system is perfect, and it would be 
irresponsible and naive to demand 
perfection; but we must not allow 
unacceptable risks of election fraud 
to taint our national elections," the 
report said. 

Gift: New school to be named for Rady 
continued from page 1 

approximately 570 miUion has been 
raised to date. 

"The impetus for this school is 
something that came really very 
much from the community," 
Chandler said. "Supporters recog-
nized that UCSD was uniquely sit-
uated for a new model school 'of 
business." 

Rady moved to San Diego with 
his family in 1966 and founded 
American Assets Inc., a privately 
owned financial conglomerate that 
manages' companies involved in 
finance, investment management 
and real estate. Rady also holds 
executive positions and shareholder 
status in several other companies. 

"I love what I do, so hopefully 
this school will allow others to 
enhance their ability to create for 
the community and for themselves, 

and enhance our country's econom-
ic success," Rady said. 

Rady said he is confident that 
the School of Management will 
have a positive impact in the world 
of business. 

"I know that this school will 
train future leaders for San Diego, 
who in turn will make a significant 
impact on this region," Rady said. 
"I'm gratified to playa role watch-
ing the school and making possible 
new generations of talented man-
agers and entrepreneurs." 

UCSD's School of Management 
was established in 2001, and its 
master of business administration 
degree was approved lastspring. It 
will seek to obtain top national 
rankings within its first five years. 
Joint degree programs are current-
ly being planned with other UCSD 
graduate schools. 

"[The school's) programs will 
leverage and build up the strength 
of this campus," Sullivan said. "The 
school will both preach and prac-
tice an entrepreneurial spirit. It will 
have a global reach, while also hav-
ing a local impact. The Rady 
School will redefine graduate busi-
ness education." 

The School of Management is a 
major initiative for the "Imagine 
What\; Next" campaign for UCSD, 
which seeks to accomplish specific 
objectives, including educational 
opportunity,' research, health care 
and ilUlovation funds, by securing 
funds from private sources. The 
campaign will conclude June 2007. 

The Rady School of 
Management will accept executive 
MBA students in fall 2004, and will 
begin accepting full-time MBA stu-
dents in fall 2005. 

Lawsuit: UCSA sues over vehicle fee repeal 
continued from page 1 

"The second is that the governor 
is only allowed to cut line items, such 
as outreach [at the University of. 
California), if there is a budget issue 
that cannot be avoided and is unan-
ticipated," Nandagopal said. "By 
cutting the tax, he created a fiscal cri-
sis, and then cut the line items. The 
crisis could have been avoided and 
was anticipated." 

The fee loss left $530 million 
dollars owed to local governments. 
These fees are currently being paid 
by deficiency appropriations and 
nearly 5150 million in cuts, justi-
fied a t the hand of the governor's 
executive office by the immediate 
deficit to the cities. 

As part of the governor's pro-
posed budget cuts, outreach pro-
grams for the University of 
California would be cut by $33.3 
million. The cuts to outreach pro-
grams were cited by all three peti-
tioners as the main reason for the 
lawsuit. 

According to Nandagopal, these 
programs are essen tial to ensure 

that underrepresented students 
become represented and for the 
population of the universities to 
more accurately reflect the diverse 
population of the state. 

"The cuts to outreach have the 
greatest effects," Kaczmarek said. 
"They affect the long-term ability 
of the university to ensure that a 
diverse group of Californians are 
eligible and can succeed in the uni-
versities ." 

Kaczmarek also cited the cuts to 
the UCS Institute for Labor and 
Employment as a concern for 
UCSA. 

"The zero funding is a political 
move which is designed to take 
money away from funding organi-
zations believed to support 
unions," he said. "These organiza-

tion~ are actually academic and 
study labor relations. The ability to 
study labor relations is something 
which affects a sizable population 
of workers in Cali fornia." 

According to both Kaczmarek 
and Nandagopal, UCSA joined 
other organizations as a party in

the lawsuit to bring attention to 
the fact that the cutting of a vehicle

Both stated that the impact of the 
cuts is not widely known and the 
consequences of the cuts even less 
so. 

The petition was filed with the 
California Supreme Court in hopes 
that it could be decided in time to 
be effective, Kaczmarek said. It asks 
for the court to block the planned 
cuts of $ I 48 million to the educa-
tion system, which will also reverse 
the repeal _of the vehicle licensing 
fee. 

"If we were to win,. it would give 
additional funding resources back to 
the university by reversing the gov-

fee," Kaczmarek said. "Hopefully, it 
would also help the people of 
California to understand the con-

impact of the vehicle licensing tax 
on education. 1bis lawsuit is an 
attempt to shed light on it."

10 FEATURES lliE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, JANUARY 26, 2004 

Tattoos: Permanent body art is painful, but worth the risk to many 
continued from page 9 

evolved from decoration to punish-
ment since criminals were some-
times tattooed as a penalty for their 
actions . 

It was primarily on sailors that 
tattooing first appeared in U.S. cul-
ture, adorning the Navy men who 
visited foreign ports. Tattoos even-
tually moved to land, but for a 
while stayed primarily on the 
streets. For years, tattooing carried 
negative connotations of vulgarity 
and crime. But a far cry from their 
yesteryear purpose of suggesting 
occupation or gang affi liation, tat-
toos today are considered a form of 
art and self-expression. 

Rapidly becoming prevalent in 
popular culrure, tattoos are worn 
by a plethora of celebrity icons 
from Sugar Ray frontrnan Mark 
McGrath to actress Drew 
Barrymore. Before filming the 
"Lord of the Rings" trilogy, the 

• nine actors playing the nine mem-
bers in the fellowship of the rings 
got tattoos wi th elvish designs 
meaning "The Nine." 

"Tattoos used to be really sub-
culture - only the deviants of soci-
ety would get them," Kraus said. 
"But nowadays, you see everyone 
running around with tattoos. You 
see teenage girls running around 
with tattoos. It's become so main-
stream that it's lost its shock value 
aspect. It's something that's now 
accepted as body art." 

Thomas Blessing, who works at 
Big City Tattoo, Inc. of San 
Diego, has noticed that customer 
preference today pays homage to 
ancient needlework. He has 
requests for all genres of tattoos, 
including tribal , Oriental, and 
1940s-style anchors, crosses, roses 
and the like. 

"It's cool knowing that my art 
travels all over," said Blessing, who 
has been in the business for 10 
years. 

However, Blessing pointed out 
that "it's not for everyone," and for 
a variety of reasons. 

"Some people can't make up 
their minds about getting a tattoo," 
he said. "It's a big decision. If 
you're looking to get a tattoo, make 
sure it's something you can live 
with for the rest of your life." 

Kraus agreed that personal 
meaning is crucial to the process. 

"You shouldn 't get a tattoo 
unless it means something to you," 
Kraus said. "Because it's something 
that'll be on your body forever." 

In addition to the permanency, 
some are deterred by the intense 
procedure. 

"The customer has to do work, 
too," Blessing said. "It isn't just the 
artist. " 

The process is not easy, nor is it 
cheap. Prices range depending on 
such factors as size, color, artist 
and shop. Kraus' black-and-white 
tattoo, which goes from shoulder 
to mid-bicep, totaled around 
$1,400. 

"¥ou really get what you pay 
for, " Kraus said. "If you go out and 
you look to spend $200 on a tattoo, 
it's not going to work. You ki nd of 
negotiate a price with [the artist]. 
Of course, you don't go in there 
with a sketch and then come back 

and say, 'No, do it for $200, not 
$300,' because then you're insult-
ing the integrity of the art. What 
you do is you say, ' I have so many 
dollars, what can you do to this 
piece so it can accommodate my 
price range? '" 

An artist can suggest ways to 
make a tattoo less costly, such as 
making it smaller or substituting 
black ink for color. 

"A lot of times you'll walk into a 
studio and they'll have a lot of 
'flash' on the wall, which is pre-
made art. They have a lot of hearts 
and knives and crosses and that sort 
of thing," Kraus said. "But really 
what you should do is walk in there 
and have an idea of what you want. 
Talk to the artist, si t down, have a 
sketch session." 

To Blessing, the relationship 
between himself as an artist and the 
customer is also a factor. A full 
sleeve of Asian art and a picture of 
a Hindu god are his two favori te 
creations. 

"While I was really happy with 
how the tattoos themselves turned 
out," he said, "I liked them so much 
because I really had a good time 
while doing them." 

He also recommended finding 
an artist that fits your needs. 

"A lot depends on the person's 
personality and the artist's person-
ality," Blessing said. "You may go 
to one shop where maybe an 
artist's got great work, but you just 
don't have a fee ling for the artist, 
and that's important. A lot of it is 
just the comfort between two peo-
ple - you're working together to 
create this piece of art. When the 
two of you are on the same wave-
length, if the person can laugh and 
have fun during the process, even 
though it's not necessarily the 
most pleasant thing in the world, 
it' ll help make the work better 
quality." 

Once a tattoo design is created, 
an artist wi ll typically practice the 
sketch before putting it on a trans-
fer paper, from which the art will 
be "traced" onto the skin with vari-
ous needles hooked up to a 
machine that regulates voltage to 
control the speed and depth of the 
needles. 

"If anyone says it's not painful , 
they're lyi ng," said Kraus, who 
underwent the proce s without the 
aid of pain medication. His artist 
was forced to pause during the 
process, because Kraus was bleed-
ing too much and the blood was 
mixing with the pigment. 

Despite the pain, tattooing is 
generall y a sa fe practice, but never-
theless, there are inherent risks 
involved. The Food and Drug 
Administration warns of various 
infections or other medical compli-
cations, as they have not yet 
approved any forms of color ink for 
injection into human skin. Tattoo 
artists must be licensed and regis-
tered with the state of California 
and are subject to annual inspec-
tions. 

T here are, however, a few basic 
precautions to look for. Blessing 
recommended that clients ask an 
artist whether he holds any profes-
sional affi liation (such as with the 
National Tattoo Association) .

Choices. choices: A customer at Toxik Shock in Padfic Beach browses the 
endless selection of 'flash' tattoo designs lining the walls of the shop. 

Work in propess: Eric Boylosd works on a large back tattoo at Monster Tattoo. Though it is a messy and painful process, 
the end result is enough to keep patrons coming back for more. 
Additionally, an artist should wash 
his hands with antibacterial soap 
and wear gloves during the proce-
dure . The workspace should be 
clean and sterile as well, and, most 
importantly, needles should be dis-
posable, not reused on clients, and 
should come in sterile bags to 
reduce the risk of blood-transmit-
ted diseases. 

For Kraus, body art is worth the 
minor risle. 

"A lot of my friends that have 
tattoos don't just have one - they 
go back and get more," he said. 
Kraus plans to finish his first one in 
the near future, and from there, is 
hoping to.,get at least one per year. 

"They're really cool in express-
ing myself, just something I like to 
have," he said. "In a way, it's an 
addiction ...

14 SPORTS THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

UCSD: Tritons earn first .. ever win over Stanford 
continued from page 16 

from the opening serve. UCSD 
came out with energy and battled 
the Cardinal early before building 
a 21-15 lead. Stanford rallied late, 
but the Tritons exorcised their 
demons from the previous match 
and closed the door on the 
Cardinal, 30-27. 

G.ime twO started out tight, but 
midway through the game, 
Stanford sent a free ball over the net 
that was ruled out of bounds by the 
linesman, but then declared in by 
the down referee, giving the point 
to the Cardinal. The Tritons 
seemed somewhat deflated at that 
point and Stanford grabbed the 
opportunity to pounce and cruise to 
a 30-23 win. 

G.ime three was a turning point, 
as each team desperately tried to 
gain control. The game was tied at 
every point up until 12 when 
Stanford slowly started building a 
. three-point lead that they nursed 
for the second half of the game. 
However, UCSD fought and ral-
lied back to tie things at 28. The

Soccer: Cochran, Carlson, Mendoza honored 
continued from page ,6 

especially pleased to see his 
defender earn the First Team 
award, noting that defenders are 
often overlooked. 

"Teams come in and look at 
Molly [Carlson) and think that 
she's slow but I've never seen any-
body get past her," McManus 
said. 

CCAA Freshman of the Year 
and All-CCAA First Team Kelly 
Cochran was named to the 

SCANadidas Division II AlI-
West Region Second Team for her 
notable play in the regular season 
and playoffs. T he mid fielder has 

proven herself to be a clutch play-
er for UCSD, kicking in three 
game-winning goals along with 
eight goals and six assists, second 
only to Jones in scoring. 

McManus, 2003 CCAA Coach 
of the Year, was named the 
NSCANadidas Division II Far 
West Region Women's Coach of 
the Year for guiding the Tritons to 
an 18-3-1 record including the 
fourth consecutive CCAA South 
Division and Tournament cham-
pionship. 

"It's good t('l receive the award. 
But, when you've got a good team, 
the coach is going to look good. 

I'm losing nine starters so we'll 
see," McManus said. "I may have 
to take a sabbatical and let the 
assistant coaches handle things," 
he joked. 

Although McManus is aware 
that many of his key players are 
graduating, he is confident that 
players such as Cochran and 
Dickey will help to fill in the gap, 
including the other underclass-
men. 

"I'm looking also to Lindsey 
Treankler, Andrea Rivas and 
Kristina De La Rossa to step up 
next season. They've been patient-
ly waiting," he said.

MONDAY, JANUARY 26, 200<1 

BasketbiJII : Johnson, J lister 
and Ginn lead the Tritons 

conrinued from page 16 
seven rebounds. Senior Ali Ginn 
and freshman Leora Juster each 
added 21 points. 

"Margaret Oohnson) was amaz-
ing the first half, and Leora Ouster) 
and Ali [Ginn) took over in the sec-
ond hal f," Malone said of her play-
ers' performances. 

Junior center Shavaki Jackson 
had 31 points for Cal State 
Stanislaus, but lacked help from 
her teammates. 

"They had a huge post player 
[Jackson) that we were having 
trouble with but we shut down all 
their outside scoring," Malone 
said. 

Cal State Stanislaus dropped 
their record to 5-9 overall and 2-7 
in the CCAA 

UCSD looked to keep the 
momentum going against a very 
tough Cal State Bakersfield team 
the following evening, and it 
appeared at the start that the 
Tritons might be headed for an 
upset. They were up 20-11 midway 
through the first half, but saw their 
lead cut to one by halftime, as the 
Roadrunners were able to over-
come poor shooting to begin the 
game. 

Cal State Bakersfield surged to 
Start the second half and forced 
numerous turnovers to build a 
healthy lead. UCSD managed only 
eight points in the first 15 minutes 
of the second half. The 
Roadrunners cruised to a 79-61 
victory, thanks in large part to the 
27 turnovers the Tritons commit-
ted. 

No Triton scored in double fig-
ures. Junior Katie McGann and 
freshman Megan Niedermeyer 
both had nine points, and Johnson 
added seven points and 10 
rebounds. 

Cal State Bakersfi eld, mean-
while, had four players score 10 or 
more points, ied by senior guard 
Jasmere Kirby with 22. 

Cal State Bakersfield main-
tained its conference lead by 
improving to 8-2 in the CCAA. 
The Roadrunners are 12-3 over-
all. 

UCSD returns to home action 
at RlMAC Arena on Jan. 30 and 
Jan. 31 to face CCAA rivals 
Sonoma State and San Francisco 
State who are both tied for fifth 
place prior to this week's play. 
Tip-off for both games will be at 
5:30 p.m.

MONDAY, JANUARY 26, 200<1 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Men's basketball keeps struggling 
UCSD drops two, extends losing streak to five 

IyMATTIYAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

After losing three games in a 
row at home, the Triton mens bas-
ketball woes continued on the road 
over the weekend as they dropped 
two games on Jan. 23 and Jan. 24 to 
their California Collegiate Athletic 
Association rivals Cal State 
Stanislaus and Cal State 
Balcersfield. 

On Jan. 23, UCSD traveled to 
Turlock to play the Cal State 
Stanislaus Warriors, who were on a 
five-game losing streak of their 
own. UCSD, however, could not 
find a way to pullout a victory, los-
ing 55-52. 

Cal State Stanislaus caught fire 
early on, up by as many as 12 points 
in the first half. The Tritons did 
not quit, however, and they battled 
back and only trailed by one at the 
end of half at 29-28. 

The game was close throughout 
the second half. The Tritons had 
the ball with a chance to take the 
lead, when junior guard K.J. 
Rosales of the Warriors stole the 
ball and was fouled with just 16 sec-
onds remaining. With a one-and-
one free throw situation, Rosales 
lost his chance to extend the lead 
by missing on the first attempt . 
Rosales then was called for a block-
ing foul on Triton guard senior 
Cameron Jackson, giving him a 
chance to tie or take the lead for 
the Tritons. Like Rosales, Jackson 
missed his opportunity to cash in 
and briclced the front end of a one-
and-one situation. The Warriors 
rebounded the ball and junior cen-
ter Dave Shultz was fouled . Shultz 
made the most of the opportunity 
and hit both free throws to give the 
Warriors a 55-52 lead with JUSt 
nine seconds remaining. 

UCSD had a shot to tie and 
send the game to overtime, but 
redshirt freshman guard Adam 
Reinking's three-pointer was off 
the marlc, preserving a 55 -52 victo-
ry for Cal State Stanislaus. 

Senior forward Jamal O'Quinn 
of the Warriors led all players with 
16 points for the night. For UCSD, 
Reinlcing was the lone Triton in 
double figures with II points, to go 
along with five rebounds. Junior 
forward Jesse Boyd added nine 
points and six boards. 

After the difficult loss against 
Cal State Stanislaus, UCSD could 
not end its slide against host Cal 
State Balcersfield on Jan. 24 and 
lost, 73-58. 

Playing the first-place 
Roadrunners (13-2, 9-1), UCSD 
looked for the upset but eight min-
utes into the game, a Cal State 
Bakersfield jumper gave the 
Roadrunners an 18-16 lead and 
they never looked back. The lead 
ballooned to 16 points at one point 
and the score was 39-25 at the half. 

The Roadrunners could not run 
away with it in the second half as 
UCSD dug in defensively and cut 

the lead to 53-48 with just under 12 
minutes to play. 

With UCSD surging, following 
a time-out, the Roadrunners 
responded by going, on a 12-0 run. 
Cal State Bakersfield took a 19-
point lead and went on to their vic-
tory. 

The Roadrunners shot a blister-
ing 54 percent from the floor (28 of 
51), while the Tritons also shot well 
at 50 percent; however, the differ-

ence was that UCSD only made a 
total of 20 field goals. Jesse Boyd 
led all scorers with 17 points for 
the Tritons. 

The loss drops UCSD to 4-11 
overall and 4-6 in the CCAA. 

The once-promising 4-1 start in 
league play has been marred and 
now UCSD must look to turn 
things around next week at home 
against Sonoma State on Jan. 30 
and San Francisco State on Jan. 31. 

AMI MIcMUIdo/Cuotdian file 
. rift fouls: After a promising start to their season, the Triton men's basketball 

team have lost five consecutive games, many of which were dose games. 

Volleyball: Keyser led UCSD with 10 blocks 
cominued from page 14 

teams traded points, and each side 
had a game point, but neither could 
capitalize. At 30-all, the Cardinal 
had the chance to take control of the 
match until a solo block by UCSD's 
Jones against Stanford's sophomore 
outside hitter Ben Reddy - who 
piled up a match-high 23 kills -
gave the Tritons the lead and anoth-
er shot to close the match. Stanford 
turned away that attempt, but 
UCSD was not to be denied and 
took the game, 33 -31, on a kill by 
Urton. 

Game four belonged to the 
Triton block as UCSD added four 
more to its team total of 17.5 
blocks for the match, led by Keyser 
who had 10 total blocb. 

"Having 17.5 [blocks) .. . I don't 

thinle we've ever seen a stat sheet 
with 17.5. Especially with Stanford 
only having five blocks, that's 
incredible for us," Toren said. 

UCSD's dominance at the net 
allowed the Tritons to cruise to a 
30-22 victory and to claim victory 
over Stanford for the first time 
ever, which pleased Larsen. 

"I'm from the Bay Area and 1 
coached and taught at Cal for 13 
years and I don't like Stanford," he 
said. "I always told my guys if you 
can give me two wins, give me 
Stanford and BYU and I'll be 
happy." 

Urton headlined a big statistical 
night for the Tritons with a team-
high 16 kills and 10 digs to share 
the team high with libero Dickens 
Tai. Jones handed out 54 assists for 

a balanced UCSD attack in which 
all five of the Tritons' starting hit-
ters ended up with double-digit kill 
totals. UCSD out-hit Stanford .307 
to .259, and committed nine fewer 
errors. 

The Tritons return to RlMAC 
Arena on Jan. 26 against Princeton 
before a difficult seven-game road 
trip. The Tritons feel they've gath-
ered some good momentum. 

"I think this year has been a com-
ing-together story. Everything's 
finally starting to click, we're all 
stlllting to believe in each other, and 
I thinle, on the coun, that's huge," 
Tai said. "We get all fired up and we 
start playing for each other." 

As long as the Tritons keep play-
ing together, it's capable of upsetting 
anyone. Just don't call it an upset.

Men's volleyball trounces No.6 Stanford 
Tritons lose to No. 15 Pacific, rebound against the Cardinal 

By BRYCE WARWICK 
Senior Staff Writer 

"The first thing that coach said to 
us is that [the story is) going to be 
titled 'UCSD upsets o. 6 
Stanford,'" Triton outside hitter, 
junior Adam Toren said after UCSD 
toppled the Cardinal 3-1 onJan. 24. 
"We didn't go into it thinking that it 
was going to be us upsetting them. 
We knew we could play with them 
pnd that we're just as good as they 
;'lre." 

Regardless of how it is labeled, 
the win was huge for the UCSD 
men's volleyball team, who 
rebounded from a disappointing 3-
o loss on Jan. 23 against No. 15 
Pacific. UCSD improved its record 
to 3-2 overall, 2-1 in the Mountain 
Pacific Sports Federation. Stanford 
- ranked sixth in the American 
Volleyball Coaches Association 
Divi ion I-II PolI - is the highest-
ranked opponent UCSD has ever 
defeated. 

The Pacific Tigers proved an 
elusive foe as the Tritons were 
plagued by missed opportunities in a 
home MPSF opener. UCSD jumped 
out to an early 15-8 lead against 
Pacific in game one, only to let the 
Tigers claw their way back into it. 
The Tritons relinquished the lead at 
26-25, capping a 6-2 Pacific run. 
The Tigers were simply more effi-
cient down the stretch, and after a 
struggle, they emerged with the 33-
31 victory. 

Game two was a battle that fea-
tured 22 ties. UCSD was able to 
open the largest lead of the game at 
23-19, but Pacific ran off four 
straight points to level the game. 
UCSD grabbed a 29-27 lead and 
had two game points to even it, but 
the Tigers fended the Tritons off. In 
the end it was back-to-back UCSD 
attack errors that gave Pacific game 
two with a 32-30 final score. 

The third game featured much 
of the same, with UCSD getting 
the better of the action for long 
periods, but Pacific finding a way 
to stay in the game. At 26-26, the 

Tigers took a timeout and then 
returned to the court to show their 
finishing instinct. Pacific went on a 
4-1 run to take the game 30-27, 
and the 3-0 sweep in the match. 

Nils Dauburs picked up a 
match-high 18 kills to lead the 
Tigers, while opposite Jim Waller 
and middle hitter Kevin Keyser 
shared team-high honors with 11 
kills each for UCSD. Triton setter 
Nate Jones had 42 assists in the loss 
and outside hitter Jeff Urton led 
the team with 10 digs. 

UCSD head coach Ron Larsen 
was disappointed with his team's 
inability to maintain a high level of 
execution throughout the match. 

"I think the guys have a real hard 
time doing the things they need to 
do for a long period of time," he 
said. "I think we have some real 
good tendencies on what a team is 
going to do and we're teUing them 
things they need to do. When they 
get tired they revert back to whatev-
er they feel comfortable doing and 
that's when we have to fight that." 

When asked whether or not his 
team could take some positives 
away from the match, Larsen broke 
things down to wins and losses. 

"You get to a point where you 
say, 'When are you going to make 
the difference? When are you 
going to make the play? When are 
you going to do the things that 
you've trained yourself to do?'" he 
said. "I don't think it's a good loss. 
I just think it's a loss." 

Despite the tough defeat, the 
UCSD players remained optimistic 
that they were close to getting back 
on the winning track. 

"I think we just need to have 
more communication aU the time," 
Keyser said. "I think we're moving 
in the right direction. We've got 
great coaching. We've got great 
leadership. Everyone knows what 
they're supposed to do. We've just 
got to fire up and get it done." 

The next night against 
Stanford, the Tritons fired it up

Women's hoops split 
over the weekend 
UCSD beats Cal State 

Stanislaus, drops to 'Runners 
By STEPHEN VONDERACH 

Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's basketball 
team earned a split from its back-
to-back games on the road on Jan. 
23 and Jan. 24. The team defeated 
Cal State Stanislaus onJan. 23, 90-
72, but dropped the game the next 
night to California Collegiate 
Athletic Association leaders Cal 
State Bakersfield. T his moved the 
Tritons' record to 9-6 overall and 
5-5 in league play. 

Against Cal State Stanislaus, the 
Tritons jumped out to a large, early 
lead of 12-0 with junior Margaret 
John on contributing eight. The 
Warriors battled back and cut the 
lead to three points at the half. 

"I told them we have to get on 
the boards or they are going to beat 
us," UCSD head coach Judy 

Malone said of her halftime com-
ments in the locker roo m . "We 
boxed out much better the second 
half." 

Cal State Stanislaus continued 
to fight back and was within one 
point with 13 minutes remaining, 
but a strong run by the Tritons put 
them comfortably ahead. UCSD 
slowly pulled away and ended up 
with an IS-point victory. 

This was the Tritons' first of 
their previous five games that was 
not decided by 10 or fewer points, 
but Malone was hesitant to say it 
was a comfortable victory. 

"I t was much closer than it 
looked," she said. "We were only 
able to pull away at the end." 

Johnson finished with a career-
high 28 points in addition to her

the Year, Most Valuable Player, 
First Team, Second Team and 
Honorable Mention), the UCSD 
women's soccer team collected a 
handful of honors from the 
National Soccer Coaches 
Association of America and adi-
das. 

Senior forward and co-captain 
Kristin Jones added yet another 
award to her collection when the 
NSCAA and adidas selected her to 
the Second Team Division II All-
America for the second consecu-
tive year. 

Jones received this distinction 
for her outstanding season, in 
which she led UCSD offensively 
with 10 goal, 12 assists in 21 
games. In addition, she led the 

CCAA in points per game, assists 
per game and assists. For the 
2003 season alone, Jones received 
CCAA Most Valuable Player of 
the Year, All-CCAA First Team 
Honors and 
Second Team 
All-America.

Tritons to the

West Region 

Coach of the Year 
Final Four. She also assisted in the 
lone Triton goal scored by fresh-
man mid fielder Megan Dickey in 
the Final Four double-overtime 
loss to Franklin Pierce. 

In addition, Jones was named 
to the NSCANadidas Division II 
All-West Region First Team with 

senior midfielder and co-captain 
Megan Mendoza and senior 
defender Molly Carlson. 
Mendoza, a 2003 All-CCAA 
Second Team honoree, tallied 
four goals and five assists for the 
Tritons while also serving as co-
captain of the squad. She also con-
tributed a key goal in UCSD's 
penalty shootout victory over Cal 
State Dominguez Hills to advance 
to the NCAA quarterfinals. 

"Mendoza proved herself to be 
the best rnidfielder in Division II 
her freshman and sophomore 
year," UCSD head coach Brian 
McManus said. "Unfortunately, 
she tore her ACL her junior year 
and again [this year), but she 
deserves [the honors)." 

Carlson, a vital part of the 
impenetrable Triton defense, 
started every game this season and 
garnered a 2003 All -CCAA 
Second Team honor at the end of 
the regular season. McManus was
