Temporary Ban on AlcOhol 
At La Jolla Shores Expires 
• 'Unintentional' lapse in law Will likely 
be follow£d by a city-wide prohibition 
By Eric Schmidt 
Staff Writer 

Though the temporary ban on 
alcohol at La Jolla Shores Beach 
installed in July expired on Friday, 
the San Diego City Council is likely 
to pass a resolution later this month 
making alcohol illegal on all city 
beaches. 

According to Terri William , 
deputy director of the Coastal Divi-
sion of the Parks and Recreation 
Department, the current legality of 
drinking alcohof at local beache 
may be short-lived. 

"The lapse in the ban was unin-
tentional," she said. 

A permanent ban was uppo ed 
to be voted on by the San Diego City 
Council earlier this month, but the 
council's agenda was full and the 
vote was postponed. 

The "No Alcohol" notice will 
remain at La Jolla Shore in antici-
pation of a mid-February oun il 
vote on the permanent ban, Wi lJi ams 
said. 

But in the meantime, it is legal to 
drink alcohol on the beach. despite 
the notice to the contrary. 

At an earlier meeting of the 
Council Committee on Public Fa-
cilities and Recreation (PF&R), five 
council members unanimou ly ap-
proved a permanent alcohol ban en-
compassing all San Diego County 
beaches and some parks. 

Williams said that since the five 
committee members compose a City 
Council majority, the permanent ban 
will probably be approved by the 
council. 

According to Laura Tedder, a 
Graduate Student As ociation 
(GSA) representative who it on 
the UCSD Committee on AI ohol 
and Sub tance Abu e, "Now is the 
time to lawfully enjoy your beers or 
wine coolers" at the beach. 

Tedder said thaI al thi point, 
"there i very little that people can 
do about [the ban] ." She noted that 
the majority of council members 

See BAN, Page 8 
Though notices reading 'No Alcohol' will remain at La Jolla 
Shores, drinking is again legal at the beach - at least temporarily. 

Third Students Lobby to Continue Name Search 
By Debbie Rosenthal 
Staff Writer 

The Third College Council has reinstated the 
Third College naming proce s. despite Provost 
Cecil Lytle's pledge to end the search. 

Members of the Third College Council de-
cided to start the project over because they were 
upset that Lytle decided to stop the search after 
so much work had been done 10 rename the 
college. 

Lytle declared that he would no longer pursue 
the project after the family of Martin Luther 
King Jr. refused to give pennis ion to name the 
college after the slain civil rights leader. King's 
family indicated that they were attempting to 
found a King College in Atlanta, and felt that 
having a college by the same name elsewhere 
would detract from the Atlanta college's unique 
status. 

The Third College Council recently created a 

,

"'. 'It". ~ 

• 

five-person committee that includes thecoun ;i l' s 
chair, vice-chair, and Third College Dean Francine 
Martinez in order to decide how to rename the 
college. 

The group' decision was to let the tudent 
population choose. Members of the committee 
drafted a letter last month that will be mailed out 
to all Third College students sometime this week. 

The letter explains the current naming situa-
tion, and asks Third College students to reread the 
position papers that were issued when the proce s 
began. These papers were essays written by stu-
dents arguing what name they thought Third 
College should have and for what reasons. 

In addition, the Third College Council will 
conduct a student survey beginning in the sixth 
week of this quarter. This will involve setting up 
tables in front of the Third College dean's office 
and in the Third residence halls, and contacting 
commuters by phone to determine student opin-

ion about essentially one queslion : whether or 
not the renaming proces should continue. 

If the result of this urvey i negative, the 
is ue will be dropped. If, however, the majority 
of tudents polled want the proce s to cOlllinue, 
then the Third College Council plans to proceed 
by holding a "town meeting" during the seventh 
or eighth week of the quarter to determine how 
the process should continue and what names will 
be considered. 

In order to speed things along, the committee 
has selected five names from which the students 
will choose should the process continue, al-
though other suggestions may be con idered as 
they arise. 

This list was agreed upon by members of the 
committee based on the most popular sugges· 
tions from the past. These names include Rosa 
Parks, SojoumerTruth, Freedom, and Sequoyah.

RING ARouND lHE CAMPUS 
• The Revelle parking lot will soon 
become UCSO's main entrance 
By Alyaa Enlow 
Staff Writ..-

Construction has begun on a new main entrance to UCSD and a 
loop road adjoining it to the rest of tile campus. The new entrance will 
be located at the intersection of the new Scripps Aquarium road and 
North Torrey Pines Road, and the loop road will continue from there 
around Revelle to connect with Gilman Drive. Although the project 
will decrease the amount of parking in the area, plans are being made 
to accomodare the problem. 

According to loop road Project Manager Jim BoMet, a civil 
engineer, the reason for this change is to connect the main campus with 
the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, which was not previously 
con.nected with the rest of UCSo. 

The first phase of the project is already in progress and is scheduled 
to be finished thJsJuly. That portion consists of the new eotty road and 
a piece of the loop road It La Jolla Shores Drive. 

The second phase will begin in July and its projected completion 
dateisJIDUII)',l992.1bis~isinteodedtoconnectthefirstsection 
with Gilman Drive. It will proceed past the Revelle tennis OOW1S,

Technique for Analyzing Satellite 
Data Promises Boom for Studies 

Los A1amos National Laboratory scientists have de-
veloped a new technique that greatly speeds the analysiS 
of satellite images used foragriculluraI forecasts,land-use 
studies, poUution monitoring, and mineraJ foil searches. 

The technique promises to bring the field of remote 
sensing from the realm of a specialist with million-OOllar 
equipment to the home of an average person with a borne 
computer.l!converts a satellite image containing literally 
billions of pieces of information into a representation of 
only a few hundred numbers thai can be easily manipu-
lated and ana1yzed. even by a small computer. 

'Thiscou1d very much revolutionize theuseofsatellite 
data. We'vedevelopedasystemthatpreseotstbcsatellite 
data in a way that it can be manipulated and understood 
even by someone who is not an expcn in remote sensing," 
said James White of tile Los Alamos Computer Research 
and Application Group. 

Farmers, for example, could use a home computer to 
study a satellite image for information on crop coverage 
or water runoff from their fields. Drug agents could loot

UCSF Student Chosen as Regent 
.A.S. VP Ruben Duran was among finalists for UC post 
By "'ry Belly HMrd 
Associate N_ EdItor 

UC San Francisco graduate stu-
dent Diane Darnell has been chosen 
by a UC Regents committee to be 
the next student regent, replacing 
Jenny Doh, a UC Irvine senior. 

Damell, 31, was among 62 ap-
plicants representing the UC's nine 
campuses. H approved, she will be 
the first student from UCSF to hold 
the student regent position. 

Damell win be recommended 
for appointment as the uc student 
regent for 1991-92. The full Board 
of Regents will act on the recom-
mendalion at its Feb. 14 meeting aI 
UC San Francisco. 

The regents' committee, headed 

by Sue Johnson, interviewed three 
finalists nominaaed by the UC Stu-
dent Association. 

TIle other two finalists were 
Dianne Chipps, a UC Berkeley 
junior, and UCSD's Ruben Duran, 
a Third College sophomore and 
Associated Students Vice President 
Administrative. 

"I met her and talked to her for & 
while," Duran said of Darnell. 
"From what 1 understand, she's the 
kind ofperson who is going to make 
an attempt to find out what under-
gmduates [want]." 

One of Duran's concerns with 
Darnell's appointment, however, 
was the fact that she is a graduate 
student aI a campus that does not 

have undergraduates. 
"It's going to be the undergradu-

ates' responsibility to let her know 
how they feel," Duran said 

He added that many students do 
not know that they have the right to 
contact the student regent with stu-
dent concerns. 

Duran said he fell"disappointed" 
that he was oot nominated himself, 
but that he learned a lot about who 
the regents are and how the system 
works. 

DarneD's involvement in student 
govermnent and campus admini~ 
tration began at Colorado State 
University, where she served as a 
student govemmeot representative.

ADMINISTRATIVE PRESSURE? 

Koala Should Have Fought the Power 
When the mo t recent issue of the campus humor paper, the 

Koala , was released last week, students were exposed to a 
picture of Assistant Vice-Chancellor Tommy Tucker eating a 
human ear. with a headline saying: '1be Shocking Truth ]s 
Finally Revealed: 'Tommy Tucker ATE My Love Child,' Sobs 
Chancellor Atkinson." The i ue, which was meant to be a 
parody of the tabloid Weekly World News,suPposedly generated 
enough negative re ponse that some members of 
the Koala taff decided to retract the issue and apologize. There 
is some indication, however. that the Koala taft's eleci ion was 
not based solely on conscience. It is po iblethat the Koala was 
pressured, at least indirectly, to apologize for the issue. If that is 
the case, then the issue is no longer one of sensitivity, but of 
censorship. 

The Koala decided to retract the issue within hours after il 
was distributed. According to Koala Co-Editor in Chief Greg 
Waypa, the decision was based, in part, by unconfinned rumors 
of possible legal action by cenain parties mentioned in the issue. 
He would not specify who those parties were. Per Came, 
managerofthe Koala, said that they received several phone cal I 
saying that the is ue was raci t. The cries of racism appareDtly 
centered around a small item entitled "Joe Watson' J ism Proves 
to be Powerful Sunblock." 

The idea that the Koala may have felt pre ure. directly or 
indirectly. from anybody is greatly disturbing. [f the pressure 
came from a few of those administrators who appeared in the 
i ue, nobody will admit it. Both Tucker and Atkinson. the 
subjects of the main story, said that they did not complain to the 
Koala about the issue. Watson did not comment. Director of 
Student Government/Student Organizations and Koala faculty 
advisor Randy Woodard said that he had received calls from 
"students, staff, and community members" about the issue, but 
would not elaborate further. But the Koala editors said that they 
had heard from Woodard that there was some administrative 
Hconcem.n 

Threats oflega! action, real or imagined, or rumors oflo ing 
funding can be a powerful weapon against a student organiza-
tion. Fearing both, the Koala backed down. Both the adminis-
tration- i f it was the administration- andtheKoala are at fault 
here. It is not the administration's place to dictate the content of 
any student publ ication. Even if nothing was actually said in this 
case, the mere threat of action can be just as effective. 

The Koala editors should have never backed down, or at least 
not as quickly as they did. They forgot, as did all of the readers 
who were offended by the issue, that in order to be funny, 
comedy often requires stepping on a few toes. Comedy is 
frequently one individual or group getting a laugh at the expense 
of another. There is little room for sensitivity in comedy. So 
when they put out an issue that rattled the cages of a few 
administrators and shook up the sensit.ivities of a few groups, 
they chose to cower rather than stand by one of their finest efforts 
to date. Indeed, if they offended so many people, in a cenain 
sense, they did their job well. After this incident, in the eyes of 
many students, they have lost their credibility as comedians. 

The Koala staff should have examined their options before 
buckling under. Had they consulted an attorney - perhaps an 
expeJ1 in constitutional law and civil libeJ1ies - they would 
have learned that potential litigants in this case don't have a leg 
to stand on in cowt. 'They would have learned that a case a few 
years ago, specifically Hustler v. Falwell, states that satire is 
fully protected underthe First Arnendment.1n that case, the U.S. 
Supreme COUJ1 decided that Hustler magazine did not have 10 
pay damages to televangelist Jerry Falwell for a bogus ad the 
magazine ran depicting Falwell having sex with his mother 
because any reasonable person could tell that the ad was satire. 

But the Koala, a joumal of satire if there ever was one, 
decided it would rather roll over to the complaints of a vocal 
minority than fight for the right to be funny. TIle Koala ca-
pitulation, however, rnay have given the administration the tool 
it needs to keep alternative media under its thumb. Dearly, if 
veiled threats and and a few complaints were all it took to silence 
the Koala this time, "students, staff and conununity members" 
can expect a kinder, less provocative Koala in the future.

For those of you who are either Iraqis 
or extreme liberals, you wl\l be happy 10 
find out that the gas and biological 
weapons might soon be used against our 
own troopS. General Colin Powell notes, 
"[iraqis) still have chemical weapons 
capability ..... As soon as the ground war 
starts Saddam could conceivably load 
Iraqi anillery. free..roclcet systems, mul· 
tiple launch systems, and air force planes 
with chemical weapons. 

The reectioo of the Gennan people 10 
all this it disheanening. They are not 
protesting &gainsl the weapons supplier.! 
or even Saddam Hussein. 

What they have chosen to protest is 
the fact that J\mcrica is cleaning up their 
mesa. On top of this, many of the so-
called peaceprolesters are trying to block 
German hospitals from treating U.S. 
IOldien. Perbaps some of the Gennan

Sec:oodly. we are doing somethinS to 
right the wrong. while Germany stands 
on the sidelines and throws insignificant 
amounts of "guilt" money at Israel and 
the war - $5 billion, or about 10 days of 
fighting. 

For those of you who are avid Recoil

Editor: 

Edward Said appears to have adopted 
the Yasir Arafat technique of conve-
niently IIIIlOI1Dclng and renouncing his 
political positions. 

Professor Said was quoted in the 
GlItlI'dian0l11an. 31 as clenying tbathe is 
a member of the Palestine Uberation 
Organization. Perhaps he reasonl that he 
is not • member because he is a leader. 

He bas held a position on the PLO 
Central Committee (the PLO "parlia-
ment") for some time. and was in fact 
louodw:ecl by Muao Miyoshl as a 
.... bcfrofthe cfeciaioa.makin, body of

The time baa come for iraq to sufi« for bel' c:rimeL 
1bus f., America has been kind to the DIdon of 1nIq, 
and it is time for tbia to stop. We have beJel back 10 far 
in Operation Desert Stonn, IIId we should lee our 
kindness mpae. 

Iraq has shown that it must be defared quicldy to 
procect the gulf region from UIICOOIcioaIIbI .cIS « 
enviromlenlallerrOrism and the dao&a'oflJ'lqi chemi-
cal and bioIogicaIlItaCk.. Seddam Huasein says dill he 
will begin using these weapons tIOOD. 

We must stop this. The answer ia to beain use of 
American and allied baalefieId nucJeerweapoIIS.1bete 
WCIIpClm QIl cripple the taraets wbi<:h have !bus far 
reaistcd destruction. An underJround bunker is little 
defense against a bwrowing nuclear missile. 

Low yield nuclear weapons can effectively level 
Baghdad and will easily destroy Iraqi ground troops, 
bunk.ers or no bunkers. This will save allied lives and 
eod the war very quickly. Nuclear attacks must be 
America's next phase of the war. 

Stop. 
How does what is written above make you feel'? Are 

you appalled? You sbould be. 
The above argument is insaoc. Whi1e 1 will quite 

freely admit that 1 am a dedicated war hawk, BOd lUll 
have no compunction about the total deslruction of 
lraq's ability to fight, I am genuinely frightened when I 
hear arguments such as the one made above. 

At the beginning of the war. these calls were largely 
ignOJ'edas the foolishness which they are. Whatclw1lcd 
this·wasaCNN/GalluppollonJan.28,l99l.1nthispoU, 
45 percent of Americans polled said thar they favored 
using tactical nuclear weapons against 1nIq, 4S percent 
were against the use of tactical nuclear weapons, and 10 
percent were undecided. Americans must beware of the 
temptation to use nuclear weapons. We must not do this, 
unless it is absolutely necessary. 

America does not need to usc: Duclear weapons to 
defeat Iraq. Conventional weapons can easily do \he job 
if given enough time. The major fear is tbal Americans 

. will JnS& for the use of nuclear weapoD5 in order to 
reduce casualty rates among our ground troopS. These 
calls must be ignored. 

Nuclear weapons aretlOf just simple explosivcs, they 
leave radiation in III area for up to S,OOO years after 
delOOalion. This has cft'ecIs which we are still DOl fully 
aware of. New infonnalionaboutthecffccls oflldiatioo 
in Hirosbima and Nagasaki is Iti1J beiDa discovered 
each year. and the effects are 001 pIcuad. 

Nuclear attacks would poison large secIions of Iraq. 
This is not fair to the Iraqi people, who did DOl ask for 
this war. Remember that the war was begun by their 
leader, and not by the people. Saddam rules Ihrou8h 
fear, not 10yaIty. Towns and industry can be rebuilt and 
populations can recover from the loss of war dead. 
Nuclear weapons leave g1usy craters which can not be 
used again in the fom;eeable futwe. 

The ramifications of nuclear attacks, even small 
ones, would be disastrous for the allied coaIitiOtL The 
first use of nuclear weapons would prove comet aU of 
the groups, both inside and outside the Anb wortd, that 
claim that America cares only for its own. and bleb 
concem for the people of other nations. 

To say that nuclear weapons are immoral wou\d be 
wrong, as war is withour morality. War is amoral, it 
doesn't care about right and wrong, just victory and 
defeat. 

Yet. formany across the globe, nuclear IIltaIX would 
be regarded as a highly inunoral act aod would tault in 
the straining of relations with many nadons, especially

Barring this above case, there is no reason for American 
use of nuclear weapons. 

One final point. In considerina the use of nuclear 
wcapom, it is importanl to remember the IJnIeli factor.

taking, hijacking and murdering 
schoolchildren, shelling kibbutzs)

me a warmonger as Miss Henry 
implies. On the contrary, support-
ing our troops definitely does not 
mean bringing them home, regard-
less of the situation in the gulf. 

you and your rights. This is under-
standably easy to forget when we 
are wrapped in our cocoon of 
safety, safety provided by our 
troops. 

Instead of writing leners to the 
editor of the Guardian, I would 
suggest Miss Henry 'write instead 
to a soldier or sailor in the gulf, and 
really support "our boys". 

Israel exists in a region sur-
rounded by despobc govenuncnts 
that have nothing but hale for the 
Jewish state (with the exception of 
Egypt.) Most of the other surround-
ing states - including Hafez 
Assad's tyrannical aUlocracy in 
Syria, the kingdoms of Jordan and 
Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, and the 
United Arab Emirates - have re-
fused to reeognize Israel and have 
refused any suggestion of peaceful 
compromise. 

Berman's antipathetic view of 
the PLO is also a valid one, consid-
ering the PLO's past eagerness and 
glee in accepting responsibility for 
such accomplishments as the 
slaughter of 1 I Israeli athletes at the 
1972 Olympics, the murder of 
Anwar Sadat. the gunning down 
and bombings of international air-
liners and passengers, the hijack and 
murder at sea of the Achille Lauro. 

"Our boys" do want to come 
home - but after they have fin-
ished what they set out to do. They Let 0lI' Boys FIlish know why they are stationed in 
Saudi Arabia. and further. why they 

shown their suppon for the terror-
istic Iraqi missile attacks on civil-
ian targets, a reminder that the 
PLO's idea of renouncing terror-
ism may be morelirnitcd than most.

But many citizens have been

REGENT 
ContInued from IMIO. 3 
She has continued her involvement 
at UCSF where, among other du-
ties, she has served as pre ident of 
the Graduate Student Association, 
lectured in medical and graduate 
courses, and taught visiting under-
graduate and high school students. 

In a statement submined to the 
selection commiuee, Damell listed 
the three most important issues fac-
ing higher education as "accessibil-
ity, diversity, and qUality." 

"1be regents must ensure that 
economic restrictions will not in-
hibit any resident from pursuing an 
education in any field by providing 
adequate financial aid and keeping 
fees low and equal for all students," 
Damell said. 

In addition, she S31d, the regents 
must pursue the establishment of 
the tenth campus, continue planned 
expansion at appropriate current 
campuses, and improve reciprocity 
and articulation agreements among 
the campuses and with other educa-
tional systems. 

"By removing financial and lo-
cation barriers, accessibility pro-
mOles diversity," Darnell said. 

NEWS 9 

She said the regents should en-
courage the faculty to create a broad 
rangeofethnic studies courses which 
would not only broaden awareness 
of issues of cultural and political 
interest, but would a\so help prepare 
residents to be competitive as Cali-
fomia moves forward within the 
Pacific Rim and worldwide econo-
mies. 

Damell Ii ted the institution or 
expansion of lower division semi-
nars and ethnic srudies courses and 
the useofsenior faculty and talented 
teachers in lower division courses 
as a means that should be used to 
improve the quality of undergradu-
ate education. 

Upon confirmation by the board, 
Damell will serve as regent desig-
nate, siuing on the board as a non-
voting member, untilluly I. 1991 
when her one-year term as student 
regent begins. 

Damell received her B.S. and 
M.S. degrees from Colorado State 
University and is working in the 
area of dev.!lopmental biology at 
UCSF. 

She expects to receive a Ph.D. 
from the Department of Anatomy 
by the end of her lerm as student 
regent next year.

Siftins through all of the con-

"question aurhoriry" applies 10 any-

Hence the formation of Students

infonnative, and non-partisan orga-

daily political issues confronting

"by srudents interesled in helping

critically at controversial issues," 
said Presidenl Bryan Dias. 

A1!hough it is slill in its planning 
stages, Sludents for Political 
Awareness meets three times a week 

to discuss issues like the crisis in the

Nine Inch Nails Rock Iguana's 
By James E. InglNln 
Editonal AssIstant 

Addiction in Los Angeles last week. While he seemed 
plea ed with Jane's perfonnance. he described the 
fans at the show as "wimpy." 

An L. A. Story of Romance and Humor 
"Bow down be/ore the one YOII sene, 

You're going to gel what YOII desene" 
- "Head Like A Hole" 

Nine Inch Nails 

It wa cleareven before the Nine Inch Nails concert 
began Saturday night at Iguana' that the average, 
main tream pop music fan wa not in attendance. No, 
the majority of the people in the black-lit club were 
adorned in dark. angst-inspired clothing. The audi-
ence had clearly come for a hard-driving release of 
pent-up aggres ions. 

Frontman Trent Reznor, in cheap Mexican altire, 
gave them what they deserved: a non- top, thrill-a-
minute orgy of industrial wallop, on-stage antics, and 
brilliant yet tormented words of hatred. 

Nine Inch Nails opened with a charged version of 
"Terrible Lie" from their only album, Pretty Halt 
Machine . From there, the show exploded to a plateau 
of raw, anger-driven force from which it never fell. 
Reznor and company then ripped into "Sin" and 
subsequently played all but one tmck from their in-
spiring Hale. 

Although thcirperformanceonly lasted a little over 
an hour, no one in the pit seemed to mind. Reznor wa 
so caught up in the power and uggestivene s of his 
mu icthat it wa nearly halfway through the et before 
he first addres ed the audience. "Good Evening. 
Mexico!" Reznor howled. even though it was almo t 
12:30 a.m. 

Later, Reznor commented on opening for Jane's 

However. Nine Inch Nails' own stage presence, 
particularly Reznor' , possessed a trange. twisted 
ort of magnetism that few at Saturday's concert 

could ignore. 
This show was definitely not for the mild or the 

heepi h. Several members of the band spit and 
hurled cups of water or bottles into the pit numerous 
times . Did the audience mind? Ha! They revelled in 
Nine Inch Nails' defiance. 

Even Reznor.on more than one occasion. conveyed 
his di pleasure with hi equipment : slamming mi-
crophones down onto the stage, kicking in speakers, 
and breaking mic stands. 

Later in the set, the band's cover of Queen's "Get 
Down, Make Love" seemed to bring the mood of the 
audience to a climactic, nerve-scrapped ecstasy as 
they awaited the alternative dance smash, "Down In 
It," which soon followed. 

Yet . it was Nine Inch Nails' final (and by far their 
be t) number, "Head Like a Hole," that really sent the 
crowd into a lamming, thrashing frenzy . The audi-
ence was so caught up in the energy emanating from 
the stage that one concert goer successfully dove 
down 20 feet from the upper reaches of the club. 
bounced off one of the speakers. and landed in the pit. 

Although San Diego's own Sweat Engine prom-
ised to be a filling opener for the orgasmic chaos to 
come. their lifeless stage pre ence. inaudible. 
uninspired lyrics. and transparent influences would 
have been better suited for a Nitzer Ebb or Front 242 
how. 

By Andy Clartle 
Staff Writer 

It is indeed a funny old world 
and. apparently, nowhere more so 
than in Los Angeles. CA. The sun 
shines through smog-laced air. 
beautiful people drive their beauti-
fu� open-top cars and commuters 
spend years figuring out how to 
make a left tum on Santa Monica 
Boulevard. 

"LA Story" is both a comedic 
celebration of life in Los Angeles 
and a modem love story. Wrillen 
and exectively-produced by Steve 
Martin. the film features the usual 
inspired mix of the Steve Martin 
approach and the "MAD Maga-
zine" satirical style. 

Martin plays Harris K. 
Telemacher. a wacky weatherman 
for KYOY Television. He is stuck 
with a girlfriend (Marilu Henner) 
with whom he has little in common 
and a job that is embarrassing. 
However. his life is changed when 
he pre-records his Saturday 
weather report before the weekend 
has begun ('This is L.A. What's 
going to change?") and is flTCd 
when it proves to be wildly inaccu-
rate. 

After losing the girlfriend to his 
agent. he falls for the channs of 
English journalist Sara McDowel 
(Victoria Tennant) whom he meets 
over a classic L.A. lunch. While 
McDowel tries to escape the atten-
tions of her ex-husband (Richard 
E. Grant). Telemacher attempts to 
extricate himself from a fling with 
a young shop assistant, SanDeE* 
(Sarah 1essica Parker). 

Steve Martin obeys a freeway sign in the comedy -L.A. Story .•

Trent Reznor giving the audience what they deserve on Saturday night at Iguana '5. 

Steve Martin is probably the 
world's number one comic actor 
( .. AllofMe ... ·'11leJerk ..... Parent-
hood;" etc.). and he is undoubt-
edly the movies major selling point. 
It marks a decisive return to form 
for Martin after the dire "My Blue 
Heaven." Gauged on wi t and origi-
nality.thatmoviebarelyregistered 
on the scale. Critics almost unani-

mously agreed that it was one of 
the biggest wastes of talent in a 
very long time. 

"L.A. Story" does much to set 
the record straight. Here, Martin ' s 
performance is inspired. He per-
fectly captures the feeling of calm 
desperation at his city life, an 
emotion that is expressed in a 
voice-over during the opening of 
the film. Telemacher says that he 
was "deeply unhappy. But I didn't 
know it because I was so happy all 
the time." 

IITlportan t Financial Aid Notice 

Deadline: 
Friday 15 February 

Current students who wish to submit 1990/91 applications for Stafford Loans, Supple-
mental Loans for Students (SLS), and the Parent Loan (PLUS) Programs must do so by 
this deadline. This assumes you have already submitted a Student Aid Application for 
California (SAAC) and have been evaluated and determined to have Stafford/Supple-
mental Loan eligibility. February 15 is also the deadline for all student-initiated revi-
sions, budget extensions, and budget add-ons. For further information, contact your 
college. 

Student Financial Services Office 

Comedians such as Eddie 
Murphy might resort to cruel or 
blatant humor to make a point about 
L.A.·s idiosyncracies, but Martin's 
humor is never harsh. [nstead, it 
makes you see the silliness of life. 

Much of this revival should be 
attributed to Martin's own script-
writing abilities and his choice of 
Englishman Mick Jackson as di-
rector. The two previously col-
laborated on "Roxanne" which 
after "Parenthood." proved to be 
Steve Martin's biggest commer-

cial succe~s. A personal script 
obviously helps to a great 
extent, but1ackson seems to 
aIJow Martin the freedom he 
needs to really hit his stride. 

Furthurrnore, letting a Brit 
direct a movie about a 
uniquely American city wa 
a smart move. hallows a fresh 
perspective on an essentially 
chic and trend-obsessed city. 
an angle that longtime resi-
dents could have ceased to 
see. 

Jackson initially expressed 
concern to Steve Martin who 
offered the potentuu job, but 
he was assurred iliat "LA 
has so many aspects that you 
could get it wrong and it'll 
still be right." 

The British flavor contin-
ues into the supporting cast. 
Victoria Tennant (Martin's 
real-life wife) turns in a 
charming performance as the 
slightly eccentric English re-
porter. It is their fi rst on-
screen reunion since Carl 
Reiner's inspired" All of Me, " 
and the pair's chemi try to-
gether shows through won-
derfully. 

The English people por-
trayed here, especially Rich-
ard E. Grant' s character. come 
off only slightly better that 
they did in 'Three Men and a 
Little Lady." Despite what 

Hollywood seems to believe, this is 
an innacurate depiction of the En-
glish. 

The movie picks on extremes. 
however. and Sarah Jessica Parker's 
SanDeE* is brilliantly Californian 
- no other breed would willingly 
have a "colonic enema"toclearout 
it's system! 

"L.A. Story" is described by all 
involved not only as a romantic 
comedy. but also a contemporary 
fairy tale. To this end. Manin has 
interwoven into the film a unique 

touch of fantasy . Throughout the 
movie, a digital freeway sign 
flashes personal and my terious 
messages to Telemacher. It be-
comes a counsel. critic, devil's 
advocate and a " friend ." 

Fantasy becomes merged with 
satiric observation. but the diver-
sions do little to distract one's at-
tention. Instead they add a magical 
quality to the film and give neces-
sary counterpoints to the on-going 
humor. 

The movie has many classic set-
pieces. It almost becomes too hard 

,,'L.A. Story' does 
much to set the record 
straight. Here, Martin's 
performance is in-
spired. He perfectly 
captures the feeling of 
calm desperation at his 
city life." 

to select a handful. The art gallery 
scenes. the L.A. lunch and 
Telemacher's olution to L.A.'s 
rush-hour are among most memo-
rable. You need to concentrate on 
the background of scenes as much 
as the foreground to avoid missing 
some of the movie's funniest mo-
ments. 

In addition, cameos from Rick 
Moranis. Chevy Chase. Woody 
Harrelson, and Patrick Stewart 
(Captain Picard from "Star Trek") 
keep the audience constantly alert. 
From the film's opening montage 
to its closing voice over, this is 
popular cinema at its best. 

In 1979, Woody Allen wrote 
and directed the ultimate comedic 
tribute to New York in his deeply 
personal "Manhattan." Twelve 
years later. Steve Martin has prob-
ably achieved the same for Los 
Angeles with his "L.A. Story."

cent, perhaps more, is going to 
restrict access to a great number of 
students as well as cause a burden 
for those students who are able to 
come," said Molly McKay. a 
Revelle junior. "An increase in fees 
must not balance the entire budget 
- we must accept our part, but we 
cannot accept an unfair amount." 

According to McKay, students 
who support themselves often work 
full time during the summer months 
to save money for school. But the . 
current economic recession is 
making it more difficult to find 
work and to cope with increased 
fees. 

Tom Rutter, the director of stu-
dent financial services, explained 
how a fee increase would affect 
students on fmancial aid. 

"If an increase occurs, there's 
an automatic rerum to financial 
aid," he said. 

Under the mechanism used in 
past years, if fees were increased 
by $1 million, for example, 20 
percent (or $200,(00) would go to 
financial aid reci pients to compen-
sate them for the increase, ac-
cording to Rutter. 

"Last year, there was an in-
crease in grant money that at least 
covered the increase [in fees)," 
Ruttersaid. "Hopefully. that would 
occur again." 

If the procedure works as it has 
in the past, "needy students" will 
not face undue hardship, but Rutter 
pointed out that not every student 
currently on financial aid will nec-
essarily qualify as "needy." 

Dreilinger expressed concern 
that Muir College would lose stu-
dents, saying that "students on par-
tial aid might get hurt the worst" 
He noted that many students might 
be forced to work to support them-
selves, making it more difficult to 
succeed in school. He fears that 
this will lead to more counseling 
and lower grades for some students. 

Marsh agreed that a fee increase 
would be important for students on 
financial aid. 

According to Runer, in the worst 
case, students in need of funds 
might be forced to take out student 
loans. 

Thus, while it is impossible at 
this point to predict exactly how 
UCSD students, faculty, and staff 
will be affected by the budget 
crunch, there is no doubt that they 
will be. 

"This is going to be a disaster," 
Atkinson said. "It's time for people 
to realize this ...

ContInued from pege 28 
Coach Judy Malone, early in the 
game it appeared as though the 
Tritons would have their way with 
the Regals, shooting 66 percent 
from the floor for the first half on 
their way to building a 41-28 half-
time lead. 

But the Regals, and the referees, 
had other ideas as the Tritons' 
potent inside tandem of sophomore 
forward Lisa Beaver and junior 
Cari Young ran into foul trouble 

DEFENSE 
ContInued from pege 28 
was available, I offered him [the 
assistant coaching position) right 
away." 

Junior forward Molly Jonnum, 
the Tritons' best defensive player, 
says that Mottershaw brings a new 
philosophy on defense to practice. 

"He works on a different aspect 
of our defense every day," she 
commented. 

"One day we will only worle on 

late in the game. 
At the time, UCSD was ahead 

by 20 points, but that margin 
dwindled rapidly as the Tritons 
committed numerous turnovers on 
a series of possessions against Cal 
Lutheran's aggressive press. 

With roughly 2:4S remaining, 
and Beaver out of the game for 
good with her fifth foul, the Regals 
cut the Triton advantage to just 
two, at 64-62. But the Tritons, be-
hind senior guard Kathleen 
Alvarez, pulled away once again 
with a 10-0 run to end the game. 

[defending] penetrations, the next 
day screens, and so on." 

The results are clear, as the Tri-
tons have held opponents to 36 
percent field goal shooting and 54.4 
points per game, down 14 points 
from last year. 

According to forward Cari 
Young, defense is something that 
the team takes pride in, and uses to 
overcome its sometimes erratic 
offense. 

"We hustle more, and worle 
harderondefense,"shesaid. "Most 

The UCSD Guardian 

The Tritons were paced by 16 
points apiece from Young and 
Alvarez. 

Despite her team's second-half 
ball-handling woes - which 
translated into 24 turnovers for 
the game - Malone was ex-
tremely pleased with the Tritons' 
effort-

"We held together, got our 
composure back and were able to 
hold on for the win," she said. 
"Most important, wedidn't panic. 
I think that showed a lot of team 
maturity on our part." 

teams play at defense. and then 
concentrate on offense. For us, 
defense is our game." 

Jonnum added, "When our of-
fense struggles, our defense can 
pick us up and cany us to a win." 

While Mottershaw modestly 
claims that his players are the only 
reason for the Tritons' turnaround, 
Malone knows better. 

"He's taken a lot of pressure off 
me," she said. 

"In previous years, I had to 
control all aspects of our game."

The Stags remained confident 
throughout the second period, hit-

game at 78. 

UCSD's Tim RapP. who went 
15 for 32 from the floor and led all 
scorers with 40. tried a last-second 
shot from deep in the comer that 
didn't fall. and the game went into 
ovenime. 

From there, the Tritons showed 
why they ' re ranked tenth in the 
nation, as they scored 19 points in

inlO the staning lineup after a phe-
nomenal performance this fall. 

Yates, in his tenth year at UCSD. 
adm.its that this year's team lacks 
outstanding talent, but he sees 
something special in this group. 

"There's definitely a better 
chemistry amongst the players all 
the way around. [As far as my 
mainstay at UCSD goes). 1 love 
doing this [coaching) more than 
anything; as long as it remains that 
way. I'll be here." Yates said. 

Another reason is the chance to 
win a national championShip. In 
that respect, the Tritons are still 
confident. 

"Yes, we may have lost a lot of 
great players [from) last year, but 
we don't rebuild . . . we re-Ioad," 
Kandler said 

said. 
"We really came out and played 

tremendously." 
A key to the Tritons' win was 

Dervin Jackson. who had II steals 
in the game, including three in the 
overtime period. that all but locked 
up the game for UCSD as they 
quickly went up by six. 

Claremont's Chris Greene shot 
a sizzling 62 percent from the floor 
to lead his team with 33 points. 

The win raises the Tritons' 
recordto 17-3. and was akey hurdle 
in UCSD's bid for a playoff berth. 

" [TIle win) couJdn 't have come 
at a better time." Marshall said. 
"We've known for a long time that 
it was going to be a big game," he 
said, remembering that UCSD and 
Claremont were two of the West 
Coast teams that made it into last 
season ' s NCAA regional playoffs.

"We're going to hit the ball, no

very solid. We have a talented,

One potential obstacle for the 
Tritons is perhaps the toughest 
schedule in the program's history. 

"We definitely have the tough-
est schedule of Division ill teams 
in the country. February will be a 
big test for us because we play 
some great schools. I figure our 

The UCSD Guardian 

momentum will pick up the most 
in March," Yates said. 

A second potential obstacle for 
the Tritons is the pitching staff, 
whose youth appears to be UCSD' s 
Achilles' heel. Yates has turned 
the pitching responsibilities over 
to first-year coach Max Kandler 
and IO-year veteran coach Tom 
Cartier. 

Kandler, from the University of 
Wisconsin-Whitewaler, feels he 
and Cartier have put together a 
solid pitching staff, led by junior 
transfer Bryan lbomason, a six-
fOOl right-hander from Imperial 

Valley College who was named 
the number one starter this fall. 

"I have greal confidence in 
Bryan; he's been ourmosl consis-
tent pitcher this fall. He's a com-
petitorand he worltsquickJy ,which 
is what I'd like to see our other 
pitchers do as well," Yates said. 

Others who figure in the rotation 
are senior Rich Tomolonis, 
sophomore Ryan Hanagan, and 
junior uansfer Brent Hansen. 

Offensively, the Triton attack 
will be blessed with an abundance 
of left-handed hiners. With the

UCSD hopes to increase its 1990

To that end, the Tritons will 
rely on desigOated hitter-outfielder 
Karl Friedl , shortstop Steve 
Nowlan, junior outfielder Ernie 
Isola, first-baseman Ted White, and 
catcher Anthony Sanchez, the heart 
of the Triton order. 

"This year, I'm not going to

SHAWCROFT 
ContInued from .,. 22 

Tom is as intent as anyone on 
proving that he deserves his spot 
on the tearn. UCSD recruited 
Shawcroft out of high school but 
he passed up the chance because 
he didn't want to rely on his father 
to get him anywhere. In fact, during 
his first year at UCSD, he tried to 
stay away from his father. 

"I didn't want anyone to think 
I was trying 10 use my father to 
play," Tom said. 

"When 1 got my staning job 
last year 1 kind of proved it to 
myself and to the rest of the team 
that 1 could play, and it doesn't 
bother me anymore." 

Shawcroft provedjusl how well 
he can play earlier this season 
when he was named an All-
Tournament selection at the Tri-
ton Tip-Off Tournament. 

Marshall and Coach Shawcroft 
feel that another reason Tom has 
adapted so well is that he is a team 
player. Both coaches concentrate 
on a team philosophy, and lack 
Shawcroft feels his son bas fit in 
exceptionally well. 

While the Shawcrofts try to 
maintain a player-roach relation-
ship on the court, both try to leave 
the game behind when they go 
home. 

"When the game is over or 
when practice is over, you have to 
leave it behind," lack Shawcroft 
said. 

Tom agrees that once they step 
off the coun, they're father and 
son, and they try to concentrate on 
other things. 

Tom ultimately made thedeci-
sion to come to UCSD because of 
the educational system, as well as 
the athletic system. He admired 
the fact that the team members 
were students as well as athletes. 

"That impressed on me the fact 
that there's something more than 
basketball," Tom said. "I [came to 
UCSD] and I'm going to play 
[basketball], but I'm going to get 
an education." 

Tom is a Warren College stu-
dent majoring in Economics. He 
is on schedule to graduate this 
year. 

The value of an education is 
something that his father has al-
ways tried to instill in him. 

"[At UCSD] you're a student 
first and an athlete second," Coach 
Shawcroft said. -

He admires the fact that 
Marshall and the rest of the team 
take academics so seriously. 

"You go to school to be a stu-
dent, [and] hopefully you can 
graduate and become an asset to 
society. 

"One of the things that makes 
me happy tb see, is that when 
practice is over, I don't have to say 
anything about [Tom studying]_ 
He understands the value of edu-
cation." 

lack Shawcroft is as proud of 
his son as any fathercould ever be, 
and feels that Tom has been very 
beneficial to the team. 

"I've enjoyed working with 
him in a father-son relationship, 
but also in a COICh-ptayer rela-
tionship," he said. . 

Tom 'sadrniraIionforhisfather 
is mutual. "He's my rock. When-
ever I have a bed game I can go to 
him. and whenever I have a good 
game he's always abe first pet10D 
to compliment me," Tom said. 

"He's probably been the 
greatest example I could ever 
have."

Shawcrofts Turning Basketball into Family Affair 
• The relationship 
between Tom and 
Jack Shawcroft is as 
intense on the court, 
as it is caring off 

the Shawcrofts' relationship . 
They' re tough on each other, but 
deep down. each has a great deal of 
respect and love fortheother, which 
helps to motivate them and propel 
them to success. 

Jack Shawcroft became the first 
basketball coach at UCSD in 1965 
after graduating from San Diego 
State. TIle next year he moved on 
to coach at Grossmont High School 
for 15 years. and then at Grossmont 
Junior College for a season.

Every little kid looks forward to 
spending a little time with his fa -

or just shooting some hoops with 
goodol ' dad is something that can 't 
be equaled. To some, it'sjust good 
clean fun . To others, however, a 
game of one-on-one with "the old 
man" can tum into a grudge match 
and the most intense of challenges. 
. That's what it was for Tom 
Shawcrofi:, a senior guard on the 
UCSD men 's basketball team,

"( made a vow that T would 

never get il)volved [in coaching] 
my kids," Coach Shawcroft said. 

"( saw too many fathers that got 
involved with their kids and began 
to put so much pressure on their 
own children to succeed. that I said 
'I don't want to put that kind of 
pressure on my own kids. ' 

"r didn' t want to consciously 
force them into something." 

That's not to say that it stopped 
him from being tough on Tom. 
Coach Shawcroft admits that at 
times he can be harder on his son 
than on any other person on the 
team. He often finds himself 
stressing the positive aspects of 
the other players' games while 
tending to focus on the negative 
with Tom. 

"He holds nothing back when 
we'reon the court," Tom said. The 
younger Shawcroft admits that his 
father's presence often motivates 
him to work: a little harder. 

Mrs. Shawcroft agrees. "It's 
kind of difficult sometimes. It 
makesTomwolkharder." she said. 

Don't think for a minute that 
just because Jack is a coach. Tom 
gets any special treatment. On the 
court. Tom is just, "one of the 
guys," and he's proven to his father, 
and the Tritons. that he deserves to 
be out there. even going so far as to 
call his father "coach" on the court. 

"Tom is avery. very good player 
and hedescrves to be in the starting 
rotation." Head Coach Tom 
Marshall said. 

Marshall believes that Tom's 
talent makes the situation some-
what easier. 

"Tom is definitely a starting 
two-guard forward and bas been 
for the 1ast two years. [He's] lived 
up to everything we've asked him 
to do." he said. 

According to Marshall. the fact 
that Tom has grown up in and 
around a basketball family makes 
him an easier playertocoach. That, 
combined with the fact that father 
and son seem to get along so well, 
has made a potentially awkward 
situation very pleasant for 
Marshall.

Madonna, Hell, and 
San Quentin 
J UST A FEW OTES: • There ' really no rea on to believe that the entire 
U SD campu will go into the 
dumper if the athletic program 
move to Division II, or po ibly 
in the future, Division I. 

While there are several 
Divi ion I chools that rank 
ocially ju t above San Quentin, 

there are .11 0 everul excellent 
athletic program at fine univer-
sitie all around the country. 

Just I k at Duke, Michigan, 
or Stanford. Each runs a first -rate 
athletic program. as well as being 
v ~ ry highly-re pected for 
academics. 

And I/obody mistakes them for 
San Diego State. 

If th chool is careful, and 
maintain the sanle, or even 
higher, tandard that it adhere 
to now, why can't the arne be 
aid for UCSD? 

The main problem with 
s hools like UNLV, Oklahoma, 
or USC i that the athletic 
program begins to control the 
choo!. That's jllst the main 

problem . .. Britannica cOllldn' t 
list the rest of their falllts . 

As long a the university doe 
not get lazy and keep thing in 
perspective, that should not 
happen here. 

The key. however, i to not 
get lazy. With the dedication that 
the admini tration has shown 
toward building a top-notch 
university. that is not likely to 
happen. 

H AS THE whole sporting world gone nut ? Why 
are people with the athletic talent 
of a pig and the market value of a 
diseased frog receiving alaries 
in the millions? 

Jose Canseco was a whoa, 
Bud Black wa a huh, but the 
latest to pa s through the Golden 
Gate of Payroll Hell i the 
bigge t my tery. 

Fernando Valenzuela will 
receive $2.5 million a year from 
the Big Blue Dodger in the sky, 
and owners everywhere are 
scratching themselves into 
contract with Head and Shoul-
ders. 

Fernando hasn't thrown a 
fastball over 85 mph in four 
years, his ann i four inches 
longer than his body, and hi 
crewball hasn't broken left since 

Madonna was a virgin. 
Not to mention, he's got a 

body that would make Roseanne 
blush. 

• USC? Yikes.

Nothing to Lose

much attention to

Tritons like it that way

Guardian Reporter

No one in the country is picking 

the Tritons to do any damage

Men's Basketball 
Dumps Stags, Win 
Streak at Nine 
By Ken Perlman 
Staff Writer 

You've gotto give the UCSD men's basket-
ball team credit. They like to keep things ex-
citing. 

Exciting was the only word that could de-
scribe the Tritons' 97-86 overtime victory 
against Claremont College Friday night. In the 
process, they extended their winning streak to 
nine, and set a new school record for consecu-
tive wins in the process. 

Perhaps the presence of the UCSD Pep Band, 
who made the trip in support of the Tritons, 
made the Stags just a little bit nervous. UCSD 
carne out hot and went up by as many as 12early 
in the first period. 

to graduation (three of whom 
igned profes ional baseball con-

tracts), and preseason polls have 

excluded UCSD from the top 30. 
But, if Head Coach Lyle Yates 

has his way, there will be more 
than a few surprised people when 
the season i all said and done.

self-imposed pressure to be the

The Beat Goes On for 
Women's Basketball 
• Tritons' 72-62 win 
over Cal Lutheran is 
record 1 Oth in a row 
By Lea Bruvold 
Associate Sports Editor 

This is starting to get tiresome 
- in a nice sort of way. 

It seems as though the UCSD 
women's basketball team has de-
cided that losing is not the thing to 
do and, in the process, has roUed 

offaschool-record IOconsecutive 
wins over the last month, including 
the Tritons' 72-62 win at Cal 
Lutheran Saturday night. 

De pite nagging foul trouble 
and a rash of second-half turnovers, 
the Tritons were able to hold off 
the hard-charging Regals (5-13), 
running their record to 16-4 in the 
process. 

According to UCSD Head

A Case for the Defense 
• Women's hoop is 
riding a 10-game win 
streak. One reason is 
an improved defense 
By Craig Elaten 

Not so for the UCSD women's 
basketball team, which has expe-
rienced a time warp back to the 
days when defense counted for 
something. 

The difference has been new 
Assistant Coach Jim Mottershaw 
who brings a hard-nosed style to 
the team. 

Staff Writer 
In coUege basketball's current 

age of run and gun, shoot em' up 
play, it's rare, if not impossible, to 
find a team that concentrates on 
playing hard-nosed, man-to-man 
defense. Defense these days means 
the best way to inbound the ball 
after a made basket. 

"I worked with him in camps," 
Triton Head Coach Judy Malone 
said. "He would always take the 
smallest kids in camp and tum 
them into scrappy players, and 
winners. When I found out that he
