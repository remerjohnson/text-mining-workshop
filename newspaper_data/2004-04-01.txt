John Ker speaks to 
thousan s at UCSD 

By NEIL SPEARS 
Senior Staff Writer 

Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) ral-
lied with thousands of students and 
community members in Price 
Center Plaza on March 30. Kerry 
discussed his plan for a $4,000 tax 
credit for college students and 
atucked the Bush administration~ 
energy policy among other cam-
paign topics. 

Event organizers estimated that 
2,300 people' fiIJed Price Center 
Plaza and about another 1,500 
observed from overflow areas near 
Library Walk. 

Price Center transformed 
overnight into a campaign stop 
worthy of national attention. A 
huge American flag was draped 
over the windows in front of the 
ballroom foyer, supporters wield-
ing campaign signs overflowed 
from the plaza, and snipers occa-
sionally scanned the crowd with 
binoculan from their vantage 
points on the roof of Price Center. 

"The energy that was in ... the 
crowd was amazing," said Kate 
Maull, president of College 
Democrats at UCSD, which spon-
sored the event. "It just went off 
without a hitch." 

The candidate's daughter, 
Vanessa Kerry, introduced him to 
the crowd. Midway through his 
half-hour-long speech, Kerry pro-
moted his national service plan. It 
will allow high school graduates to 
spend two years working in their

Candidates for A.S. president 
and other executive cabinet posi-
tions squared off for a series of 
debates hosted by Student Run 
Television's "News Junkies" pr0-
gram on March 30. While some 
candidates were unable to partici-
pate, many who did said they 

found the debates to be a useful 
means of developing their plat-
forms and reaching voters. 
Candidates were asked pre-deter-
mined questions and given 60 sec-
onds each to respond, followed by 
30 seconds each for rebuttals. 
They also responded to questions 
called in by viewers.

A.S. candidates take 
stage at Kerry rally 

Only 3 of 5 presidential 
contenders speak 

By VLADIMIR KOGAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

Three of the five candidates 
vying for next year's A.S. presiden-
cy took advantage of the large 
crowd gathered for Sen. John 
Kerry's (D-Mass.) campaign raJly 
to tout their positions and slates. 

The contenders addressed a col-
lecting audience, which at its peak 
reached an estimated 2,300, 
approximately an hour before the 
senator's appearance. The idea was 
proposed by the Kerry campaign, 
according to current A.S. President 
Jeremy Paul Gallagher. 

Harish NandagopaJ, running on 
the Students First! slate, and 
Jeremy Cogan, running on the 
Unity slate both, likened their pol-
icy stances to those of Kerry. 

"Much like Senator Kerry, who 
has committed himself to the lives 
of Americans, I've made a decision 
a few weeks ago to represent 
20,000 undergraduate UCSD stu-

dents as well as my community," 
said Cogan, a John Muir College 
junior and current A.S. commis-
sioner of enterpri e operation . 

He urged students to vote, both 
in the campu and. in the national 
presidential elections. 

"For UC 0, for our genera-
tion, continue exercising our voice, 
unify for your rights [and] don't let 
our concerns be silenced or quiet-
ed," Cogan said. 

Nandagopal praised the 
Students First! ideology, saying it 
represented everything the nation-
al candidates needed to mount a 
successful presidential campaign. 

"We are a progressive slate, 
unapologizing progressives, and 
we're damn proud of it. This is the 
time that liberals and progressives 
unite and take over the White 
House," Nandagopal said. 

Pae attempted to dispel the idea 
that UCSD students are apathetic.

UCSD researchers say dogs 
resemble their owners 

A study now claims that in the case of pure-
bred canines, dogs do resemble their owners. 
'The research conducted by UCSD social psy-
chologists Nicholas Christenfeld and Michael 
Roy found that people choose dogs that resem-
ble them. The study used a randomized photo 
matching technique where 45 dogs and owners 
were photographed separately. Judges were 
then shown the photographs of the owner, the 
owner's dog and a second dog. and asked to 
match the pictures of owner and dog. 
Researchers found that 28 judges were able to 
match 16 out of the 25 purebreds with their 
owners. No matches were found between 
mixed breed dogs and their owners. 

Researchers conduded that the similarities 
are because of owner selection at the time of 
acquisition. Researchers ruled out the theory of 
convergence, where similarity grows throughout 
the duration of ownership. The study found no 
correlation between the resemblances and how 
long the owners and dogs have been together. 
The full study can be found in the May issue of 
Psychological Science.

Ex-ambassador visits UCSD 
Alcalay quit in protest of Venezuelan policy 

Dynes in negotiations 
with chancellor finalist 

By BRYAN 1SAO 
Associate News Editor 

Former Venezuelan ambas-
sador to the United Nations Milos 
Alcalay visited UCSD on March 
30 and March 31 to speak about 
human rights violations and the 
poli tics in Venezuela. 

Alcalay, who resigned his post 
to protest human rights violations, 
addressed students and faculty and 
participated in a televised inter-
view, conducted by Institute of the 
Americas president Jeffrey 
Davidow, at the lOA. The 
Conflict and Security Studies 
Organization at the lOA, who 
organized Alcalay's visit, held a 
smaller question-and-answer ses-
sion with Alcalay on March 30, 
which approximately 40 lOA stu-
dents attended. 

Alcalay resigned his post on 
March 4 at the United Nations' 
Washington. D .C., offices 
because, according to him, human 
rights violations, repression by the 
government and an overall lack of 
democracy in Venezuela left him 
unable to represent his country. 
In the days leading up to his resig-
nation, media reports from 
Venezuela revealed increasing 
brutality and torture against those 
protesting President Hugo 
Chavez, who accuse Chavez of 
unlawfully preventing a recall 
vote. Clashes between protesters 
and government troops have 
elosed businesses and schools 
across the country in recent 
months. 

"Venezuela did not meet the 
needs of a new democracy, but it 
went back to the worst situation 
... violation of human rights, cor-
ruption and a militarization of 

power," Alealay said. "That is why, 
as a diplomat for democracy, I had 
to resign my job." . 

Alcalay described the grue-
some scenes he witnessed in 
Venezuela. 

"Protesters were shot, men 
were put in prison with very 
repressive actions that recall very 
much .. . the 
military time in 
L a tin 
America," 
Alcalay said. 
"So I said ... I 
cannot serve, 
not only loyal-
ly, but I have to 
cry very loudly 
to say, 'Look 
what is hap-
pening to 
Venezuela. 
Look what is 
happening to a 

CaUIIesy lit _wUlt 
Milos AkI!.y 

Former Venezuelan 
ambassador to the 

United Nations. 

country that was an island of 
democracy on the continent.'" 

Alcalay spoke for the needs of a 
referendum to let Venezuelans 
vote whether or not they want to 
keep Chavez, who Alealay said is 
impeding efforts 10 run a referen-
dum. 

Ncalay said Chavez was a 
"very good seller of dreams," and 
it is how Chavez has maintained 
support despite of "broken 
promises." 

"But his dreams are not dreams 
but a nightmare," he said. 
"People, especially the poorer, 
want to dream." 

Asked whether or not he 
thought the United States had a 
hand in the coup that ousted 
Chavez for 48 hours, Alcalay 
responded that he did not person-
ally believe so. 

, -

"On the contrary, I think the 
U.S. has been very cautious with 
Chavez," he said. 

CSSO president Jorge Garcia 
commended Alcalay's continued 
efforts to resolve the conflict and 
end the violence in Venezuela. 

"I think one of the things you 
have to really respect with the 
ambassador is his willingness to 
continue the dialogue," Garcia 
said. "He recognizes that there 
needs to be a bridge between 
those that are pro-Chavez and the 
opposition. The willingness to 
bridge that gap is critical for 
Venezuela. " 

Since his resignation, Alealay 
has been touring univenities in 
order to raise awareness about the 
conflict in Venezuela. In the past 
month, Alcalay has spoken at UC 
Berkeley and New York 
University. 

Garcia was pleased that Alcalay 
was able to visit UCSD and hopes 
to invite other similar speakers in 
the future. 

"I think it's critical that speak-
ers lik.e [Alcalay] come to the uni-
venity and expose some of the 
problems in different parts of the 
world to students, faculry and 
members of the communiry," 
Garcia said. 

Ncalay previously served as 
Venezuela's deputy foreign minis-
ter and ambassador to Brazil and 
was preparing to assume the post 
of ambassador to Great Britain. 
Alcalay had served Venezuela as a 
diplomat for 34 years before his 
resignation. 

The talk was televised on UC-
1V and will be re-run daily 
between April 12 and April 18.

Applicants have recently been 
narrowed down and negotiations 
are underway with a candidate for 
the new UCSD chancellor. The 
penon who is selected is expected to 
be announced in the next few weeks. 

The search committee submitted 
recommendations and a short list of 
possible candidates to the UC Office 
of the President on Feb. 25. 

According to Vice Chancellor of 
External Relations James Langley, 
the number of candidates on that 
list has been kept confidential.

"We can't get a target date of 
when negotiations with this indi-
vidual will end," Langley said. "But 
it is close. I think that the plan is 
still for within a week or two." 

According to UCOP spokesper-
son Lavonne Luquis, the process is 
still underway. 

"I don't have any specifics right

they're well into the process, but

Langley said. "All of it has to be

the responsibilities," Langley said.

After debacle, civility 
returns to A. S. elections 
W hat a difference a year makes. Last year, the kickoff 
to the A.S. election cam-
2aigns was a tense affair. 
Prior to the official start of 
camp'aigning, slates had 

~avea poster space ~y ~av­
mg student orp;afllzauons 
2laster Price Center and 
Student Center with their 
own posters. This year, 
not only was the campus 
devoid of suspicious 
posters, but the A.S. elec-
tions manager Tom 
Chapman worKed with the 
A.S. executive assistant to 
put. up their own post.ers, 
a.sking student organtZ~­
tlOns to contact fhem If 
they intended to use the 
space - a warning to 
would-be poster-savers. 
Candidates and their slates 
even waited patiently for 
an official time call from 
the elections manager. It 
appears that candidates 
have learned from last 
year's disqualification fias-
co - it isn't worth jeopar-
di zing whole campaIgns 
over a couple of posters. 

This new elections cul-

ture is a refreshing chani(el 
and Tom Chapman shoula 
be commended for his 
careful efforts in letting 
candidates know early on 
what is acceptable and 
what isn't. 

The candidates, too, 
seem to take camp~igning 

~eriously this year. Npl>ody 
IS eager to repeat ffilstakes 
from last year's elections -
and so far, so good. Its also a 
good sign that every candi-
aate for president, VIce pres-
ident and commisslOner 
positions, as well as many 
college-level candidates, 
have accepted voluntary 
spending rimits. Campus 
elections shouldn't be abOut 
whom can spend the most 
money plastering the 
school, and it is heartening 
to see that candidates 
understand this. 

If the campaign kickoff is 
any reflection of the rest of 
the campaign period, this 
year's A.S. elacoons may be 
the cleanest campaign yet. 
And with any rUCK, this 
year's civility will serve to 
set a new tone for elections 
at UCSD from here on out. 

Sen. Kerry highlights 
educational concerns 

Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) spoke at Price Center Plaza on 
March 30 during his cam-
paign tour of California. 
Kerry spoke to the audi-
ence of 4,000 primarily 
about the Unitea States' 
foreign dependence on oil 
causing higher gas prices, 
but also about another issue 
that has been affecting 
UCSD students - access 
to higher education to pre-
pare for a competitive job 
market where outsourcing 
jobs has become common. 

Kerry recognized that 
students are struggling-
because higher education IS 
becoming less affordable. At 
the University of California, 
undergraduate fees will rise 
at least 10 percent in Gov. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger's 
2004-05 budget on top of 
the 30-percent increase 
made in the last year. 

With this in mind, Kerry 
touts the "Service for 
College" plan, a worthy ini-
tiative through which young 
adults who perform two 

years of public service could 
earn a grant for the equiva-
lent of four years at their 
state's public university. 

Students need not only 
be able to gain access to 
affordable higher education, 
but must also be able to 
compete in the job market 
of the global economy. In 
order to prevent more jobs 
from being exported over-
seas, the American work 
force must be expected to 
uphold a standard of quality 
not found in other nations. 

As State Superintendent 
of Public Instruction Jack 
O'Connell outlined at the 
March 17 UC Board of 
Regents meeting, 
California students should 
be required to perform at a 
higher level while in high 
school to better adapt to

A. s. presidential candidates 
displayed promise in speeches 

Students First! likely to return to dominance 
after last year's widespread disqualifications 

By DANIEL WAm 
Opinion Editor 

John Kerry's Price Center 
rally was a perfect mic.rocosm of 
the greater political climate at 
UCSD - but it had nothing to 
do with Kerry himself. 

The three "establishment" 
A.S. presidential c~ndidates 
spoke before Kerry, each with a 
speech that showed their true 
colors and briefly highlighted 
their campaign platforms. 
Whether anyol\e in the audience 
actually cared about what they 
had to say is debatable, however. 

U ni ty presi dential candida te 
Jeremy Cogan began with a pre-
pared speech, reading straight 
from his notes. His message was 
measured and reasonable. His 
slate wants to "get things done," 
and "unify" the campus. Unity is 
comprised of people from every 
backgrOlJnd on campus, and is 
truly an all-inclusive group of 
candidates. 

Cogan's speech, which was 
met with polite applause, was 
followed by Students First! pres-
idential candidate Harish 
Nandagopal, whose fiery speech 
proclaimed what many already 
knew: Students First! is an 
unabashedly liberal slate. 
Nandagopal proudly declared 
that everyone on his slate was 

"progressive," with "no one on 
the Cillifornia Rrvitw" running 
under the Students First! name. 
His supporters in the audience 
ate it up, but the average student 
was either turned off or simply 
confused by the rant. 

Following Nandagopal was 
jenn Pae, an independent candi-
date and the current vice presi-
dent internal. Unlike the other 
candidates she dressed up for the 
occasion, appearing professional 
and open. Her speech, like 
Nandagopal's, was delivered 
without a script. Like her cam-
paign, its sentiments seemed to 
focus on her independence from 
the typical A.S. political 
machines. 

As for the slates themselves 
and their electoral prospects, 
Students First! is the likely win-
ner in almost every contested 
race. 

Although Cogan's Unity also 
deserves considerable credit for 
putting together a nearly-full 

, slate, Nandagopal's Students 
First! is noteworthy in its broad-
er-than-usual candidate pool 
and an electorally strong candi-
date roster that compensates for 
the slati's wealcnesses in other 
areas. 

For example, Nandagopal is 
not in a fraternity. On the sur-
face, this would seem to be a sig-

nificant obstacle to overcome. 
The last three presidential can-
didates to win the popular vote 
- Kevin Shawn Hsu, Jenn 
Brown, and Jeff Dodge - were 
all Greeks. Hsu and Dodge were 
members of the Pi Kappa Alpha 
fraternity and Brown was in the 
sorority Kappa Alpha Theta. 
Their slates also consisted of 
candidates from the Greek sys-
tem, like former Revelle senior 
sena tor Amy Uyeshima from 
Kappa Alpha Theta. 

To compensate, this year's 
Students First! features Kevin 
Hanson - not just a Greek, but 
also the president of the Inter-
Fraternity Council - running 
for vice president finance. His 
fraternity brother Ryan Potts, 
who lists as experience his stint 
as "Assistant Treasurer for the Pi 
Kappa Alpha fraternity" and his 
participation in a "street jam 
basketball tournament" among 
other things, is running along-
side him on Students First! for 
commissioner of athletic rela-
tions. As the first slate to run a 
commissioner of athletics candi-
date against an independent -
in this case, Triton Tide director 
Bryce Warwick - Students 
First! is taking a gamble and 
breaking tradition. Since the

Move to Division I athletics 
' would hurt school's academics 
Scholarships would degrade UCSD 
horse's 

mouth 
EdWu 

W ith March Madness sweeping college campus-es across the nation, 
UCSD students might feel a bit left 
out of the festivities. While many 
students chalk up their brackets 
and, like this wri ter, watch their 
matchup of Stanford vs. Gonzaga 
final go down in flames, one has to 
wonder what it would be like to 
anend a Division I school with an 
actual chance in the basketball 
tournament, or a school that went 
to a bowl game last year. Mer the 
somewhat successful move to 
Division II in 2000, some students 
and certainly the athletic depart-
ment have quesdoned repeatedly 
why UCSD persists in staying at 
the margins of na tional collegiate 
athletics. 

The prospect of some actual 
school spirit on this largely apa-
thetic campus is enough of a rea-
son to contemplate brea1cing with 
UCSD policy and start granting 
athletic scholarships along with 
beginning a move to Division 1. 
The External Relations depart-
ment privately believes that alum-
ni donations will never reach the 
levels of other public schools like 
Berkeley or Michigan until 
UCSD has a viable Division I 
football or basketball team. But 
what exacdy are the chances that 
we might move to Division I, pick 
up a football team andlor offer 
athletic scholanhips? And whit 
consequences would such a move 
have? 

Earl Edwards, athletic director 

at UCSD, has stated that "the like-
lihood of (footballl is between zero 
and never," mostly because the 
financial demands of a football pro-
gram would be enormous, not to 
mention that Title IX would 
require that degree of extra fund-
ing to be doubled to match wom-
ens' sports. But what about athletic 
scholarships? UCSD is one of very 
few Division II schools to not offer 
scholarships. Rules coming into 
effect in 2005-06 will require 
Division II schools to spend 
$250,000 on scholarships, but 
UCSD has been granted an exemp-
tion. The problem would be com-
pounded by an order of magnitude 

" A firm stand against 
athletic scholarships at 

UCSD in contrast to the 
rest of Division. II schools 
would reinfarce the fact 
that the only incentive 

that athletes have to come 
to UCSD is to study 

here." 

if the school ever chose to go to 
Division I, which makes it unlikely 
that UCSD could go to Division I 
without another exemption in 
scholarship rules. 

And this is where the real ques-
tion really comes in. To come close 
to participating in March Madness, 
or to even attract any viable degree 
of nlttionally recognized athletics, 
UCSD would have to offer athletic 
scholarships. And to do so, this

Unfortunately, the

hypoaitical, as it appears Cogan is 
more ready to hinder the work of 
student poups to improve our 
campus than UIist in theIe e8i0ra. 

Copn~ words obriously do not 
align with his ICtions. 

Cogan is a direct beneficiary of 

writer believes, would be a travesty, 
contravening the fOllflding princi-
ples of this academic institution 
and subscribing to a societal 
stereotype that links the greater 
purpose of higher education with 
the basest instincts of blood-
thirsty, gladiatorial combat that 
taint university education across 
the United States. 

The fundamental problem with 
Division I athletics, and athletic 
scholarships in particular, is that 
college athletics in the United 
States form an amateur league with 
an effective salary cap (college 
tuition and costs) that feeds to pro-
fessional athletics in the place of a 
viable minor league. As a result, 
instead of a purely competitive 
marketplace for desirable athletes 
based on money (like a real minor 
league), the collegiate system is 
rooted in a cesspool of black mar-
ket activity, because in some way, 
thats the only currency schools 
have to bid on except their reputa-
tions, of which UCSD has none in 
Division I. As Mark Starr of 
Newsweek points out, ~Now, 
school for scandal is an appropriate 
headline for America's collegiate 
baslcetball and football programs. 
Baptist schools, Catholic schools, 
state schools, private schools -
none is immune. Scandal is hardly 
new to college sports, but the 
breadth of offenses over the past 
couple of years is mind-boggling. 
Hindering police investigations of 
murder, rape allegations, strip-club 
frolics, boozing with underage stu-
dents, illegal payments to players, 
sex parties for recruits, academic 
fraud, academic fraud, academic 
fraud." 

This is not a track record of

rnURSDAY, APRIL I, 2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Eledion: Unity slate resembles 2002's 
Action slate in qualifications and experience 

c~ from pact S 
three votes ahead of his oppo-
nent. In 2002, the slate was 
stronger. But although they 
swept every major position 
except commissioner of pro-
gramming, their margin of victo-
ry was often smaller than the 
number of votes received by one 
of the many third party candi-
dates that ran that year. The vice 
president internal and vice presi-
dent finance candidates each 
won his election with especially 
slim margins. In head-to-head 
match-ups with the rival Action 
slate, Students First! lost almost 
as many positions as it won. Six 
senate seats and the commission-
er of programming were surren-
dered to its Action opponents. 

Incidentally, this year's Uni ty 
slate bears more than a passing 
resemblance to the Ac tion slate 
of 2002. T he candi dates are, for 
the most part, "i n-house" A.S. or 
college council officials. T hei r 
pla tform consis ts of a "get it 
done" mentality, a opposed to 
Students First "s ambiguous 
pledge to "stand for something." 
Similarly, Action had specific 
goals in mind, like getting meal 
points accepted at the Grove 
Caffe and initia ting new A.S. 
enterpri ses. The incu mbent 
Unity candidates have even 
implemented some of Action's 
goals. Meal poi nts are now 
accepted at the Grove, and 
Cogan is starting up new A.S. 
enterprises like the "ropes 
course" and an online boole 
exchange. 

While Students First! also has 
candidates with experience - a 
surprising number coming 
straight out of the current A.S. 
departments - it draws its sup-
pon primarily from outside stu-
dent organizations. In some cases, 

this results in candidates with 
dubious qualifications - such as 
the aforementioned Potts ~ng 
for the athletics position - but in 
others, it has the potential to 
bring fresh faces to the council 
that may acrually have better rela-
tionships with their constiruents 
than with preexisting A.S. officers. 

As for this year's independent 
candidates, they are much more 
impressive than the usual fare. 

" Although the potential is there, independents 
and Unity candidates wiU 

have a difficult time 
unseating this year's 

Students First! slate ." 
Presidential candidate Steve 
York ra n last year for vice presi-
dent internal. He's more knowl-
edgeable about campus politics 
and issues than voters might 
assume from his casual demeanor 
and famous "cigarettes, blo\\,-
P.ops and condoms" campaign . 

Pae herself was a former Unity 
candidate for vice president inter-
nal last year. Her campaign i 
more viable than most indepen-
dents, who usually have little to 
no active supporters and no visible 
campaign. Pae has been out on 
Library Walk since May 29 with 
her blue T-shirts and buttons. 

Independent Commissioner 
of Programming candidate 
Spencer pforsich is another rari-
ry. He has worked in the current 
programmer's of6ce as Nooner 
Coordinator - a position once 
held by last year's Commissioner 

of Programming Gabe 
Grossman. Although he still faces 
an uphill battle in a one-on-one 
COntest with three-time candi-
date and current A.S. festivals 
coordinator Rishi Shah, who won 
the position last year, Pforisch 
has the potential for an upset. 

Despite their potential, one-
on-one face-offs with Srudents 
First! candidates are unlikely to 
result in victory. Srudents First! 
is nearly invincible, if 
Nandagopal's gamble with ath-
letics and the Greeks pays off 
and their support is combined 
with that of the Students First!-
allied SAAC organizations, 

Furthermore, in the 
inevi table runoff election for the 
presidency, Students First! has 
an undeniable advantage. Unity's 
support, like Action's, will come 
from students who recognize 
their candidates' experience and 
abili ty. Students First"s will 
draw its upport from its allied 
orga ni zations: SAAC. liberal 
organiza tions, and now possibly 
athletes and Greeks . Phone 
banking and mass e-mails sent 
th rough club li stservs the night 
before the runoff will ensure 
Students Firs t"s supporters wil l 
tu rn our. Unity does not have the 
phone li sts and e-mail add resses 
of the students it will win over, 
but Students First!'s eventual 
supporters will receive literature 
every day of the election. 

Although the potential is 
there, independents and Unity 
candidates will have a difficult 
time unseating this year 's 
Students First! slate. Unless voter 
turnout increases threefold, 
Nandagopal .will become our next 
A.S. president and Srudents First! 
will control most of the executive 
positions and half of the senate.

lem in Division I athletics that 
UCSD should have no part in, 
regardless of the benefits to

moral grounds and on the 
grounds of refusing to compro-

four years, this writer has lament-

Kerry: Presidential candidate speaks on plans for affordable higher education 
continued from page I 

communities in exchange for four 
years of their state's public college 
tuition. 

"1 believe we ought to start to 
make it possible for no young per-
son in America to ever have to 
compromise their dreams because 
of the cost of education," Kerry 
said. 

Kerry also discussed a program 
that will help students payoff loans 
if they teach in underprivileged 
schools after graduating from col-
lege. 

Student reaction to the rally was 
largely positive. 

"I like his educational policies 
and giving that $4,000 back," Earl 
Warren College sophomore Robin 
Basra said. "I think that'll help stu-
dents out across the country." 

About a dozen representatives 
from the Campus Republicans 
appeared at the rally, clapping san-
dals whenever Kerry mentioned 
President Bush. Kerry acknowl-
edged the group by saying he was 
glad they anended and that they 
would learn a lot. 

"HewasJohn Kerry as always-
very eloquent, always flip-flopping 
from side to side. We named a shoe 
after him," Thurgood Marshall 
College senior Viet Tran said, refer-
ring to the sandals the College 
Republicans brought to the rally. 

During the rally, Kerry outlined 
a plan to lower gasoline prices, 
which are at record highs in San 
Diego and in many parts of the 
country. Kerry promised to pres-
sure oil producers to increase sup-
ply, temporarily stop filling the 
strategic petroleum reserve, and set 
a goal that 20 percent of the 
nation's electricity will be produced 
by renewable sources by the year 
2020. 

'''If the gas prices keep rising at 
the rate they're rising now, Dick 
Cheney and George Bush are 
going to have to carpool to work," 
Kerry said. "These aren't Exxon 
prices. These are Halliburton 
prices." 

Bush press secretary Scott 
McClellan countered Kerry's accu-
sations on March 30 by blaming 
Congress for not approving Bush's 
energy plan and alleging that Kerry 
plans to raise gasoline taxes. Kerry's 
platform, as currently outlined, 
does not include a gas-tax increase. 

A.S . President Jeremy Paul 
Gallagher spoke to the crowd 
before Kerry's appearance to 
encourage students to vote in next 
week's A.S. elections. 

"Who here is ready to join in 
the fight for what they believe in? 
Who here is ready to educate 
themselves and make a change in 
the status quo for the better?" 

Gallagher asked the crowd, which 
cheered in response. 

The rally was originally spon-
sored by Associated Students. 
However, since Associated 
Students is a unit of the Student 
Affairs division of the university, it 
was not allowed to host a partisan 
political candidate. The College 
Democrats at UCSD took over as 
the official sponsors of the event, 
but nei ther the College Democrats 
nor Associated Students spent any 
money bringing Kerry to UCSD. 

"It wasn't a fight we had the 
time ... to fight with [Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs) Joe 
Watson over," Maull said. 

Security for the rally was coor-
dinated between the UCSD Police, 
San Diego Police and the Secret 
Service. Dozens of officers were on 
hand to secure the event. 

"He came in, did his presenta-
tion and left without incident," 
UCSD Patrol Sergeant Jeff Cox 
said. 

Assistant Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Carmen Vazquez 
applauded the hard work that went 
into planning the event. 

"This will help support not only 
our A.S. elections, but have stu-
dents be more informed and maybe 
help to be involved in their civic 
responsibility long-term," Vazquez 
said. "That's what it's all about, 

Grove: A.S. approves meal points.contract 
continued from page I 

H&DS Director Mark 
Cunningham said. 

Under the program, customers 
who choose to use meal points will 
order from a special menu with 
different pricing. Prices for cash 
orders will no! change. 

"1n order to pay for the costs of 
the service, there had to be a sep-
arate pricing scheme for dini ng 
dollar customers," A.S. 
Commissioner of Enterprise 
Operations Jeremy Cogan said. 

According to the contract, 38 
cents of every dining dollar is used 
to purchase the actual food prod-
UC!. The remainder is used to 
cover electricity at dining facili-
ties, pay employees and cover 
other overhead costs. 

Because non-food costs do not 
change based upon consumption, 
one of the hurdles to the imple-
mentation of the program was 
creating a way for H&DS not to 
lose the non-food proportion of 
each dining dollar spent at the 
Grove, according to Cogan. The 
solution was the dual-pricing plan. 

"The key was finding a pro-

gram concept to put in place to 
see if it will work for all parties 
involved," Cunningham said. 

H&DS will pay the Grove the 
approximate equivalent of the 
cash price for each menu item. 
The higher dining dollar prices 
renect the co t of maintaining 
Dining Services' current opera-
tion and implementing the din-
ing dollars program at the 
Grove. 

"We will emphasize to every 
custOmer that neither the Grove 
Cafe nor Housing and Dining is 
receiving any special revenue," 
Cogan said. U[t's no hidden agen-
da j there's no secret behind it." 

The contract requires the 
Grove to use eggs, dairy products 
and frozen foods that are no lower 
than U DA Grade A. Fresh pro-
duce must be number-one quality 
and canned fruits and fruit juices 
are to be USDA "fancy" and 
"choice." 

The A.S. Council approved the 
contract by consensus after no 
debate on the council noor. 

The push for dining dollars at 
the Grove has been in the works 

since the beginning of the year. 
"I felt that this time around, 1 

demonstrated to Mark 
Cunningham that A.S. was willing 
to work with Housing and Dining 
to come up with a plan that solved 
all necessary factors in acrually 
rolling it out," togan said. 

Cogan estimates that the infra-
strucrure to accept dining dollars 
will be in place in one to two 
weeks. If the program is a success, 
the increase in business may actu-
ally lead to an across-the-board 
decrease in prices. 

"As I see it personally, we are 
able to offer our support as a 
department for this additional 
choice for our residents and also 
show our support for our students 
and student-run programs, while 
not bringing on a new program 
that drives room and board rates 
up or jeopardizes our self-sup-
porting dining program financial-
ly," Cunningham said. 

The contract expires at the end 
of the quarter to allow H&DS and 
the A.S. Office of Enterprise 
Operations to evaluate the success 
of the program. 

Speeches: York claims being left out 
continued from page I 

"People say students are apa-
thetic, but it was really encouraging 
to see so many people out there in 
support or just coming out and 
making a statement, making it visi-
ble that students care about the 
issucs," said Revelle College senior 
Jenn Pae, an independent presiden-
tial candidate. "I'm JUSt really fortu-
nate and glad to be a part of it." 

In her speech, Pae, who cur-
rently serves as vice president 
internal, stressed her autonomy 
and lack of slate identification. 
She said she is running on "values 
of honesty and sincerity. 

"In the last four years, I have 
had many (leadership) experi-
ences, so 1 know what the students 
want (and) 1 know what the stu-
dents need," she said to the crowd. 

However, Kris Saradpon and 
Steve York, the two other inde-
pendent candidates, say that they 
were never offered an opportunity 
to participate, contending that 
they never received the invitation. 

York suggested that the two 

have been singled out because 
they are not running on estab-
lished slates and do not currently 
serve on the A.S. Council. 

"Certainly this is a travesty," 
York, a John Muir College junior, 
said. "The point of a whole-cam-
pus election is equal time for all 
candidates, no matter what their 
stance, no matter what their expe-
rience." 

Though Saradpon believes the 
one-day period given to the candi-
dates for confirming their atten-
dance at the rally was unreason-
able, the Muir junior admitted 
that he may have erroneously 
erased the e-mail. 

"I could've just mistaken it for 
spam mail, and not thought about 
it," he said. 

York maintains that he never 
received the message. 

"I received no e-mail, and 1 
checked my deleted e-mail, saved 
e-mail and spam e-mail," he said. 
York went on to say that he might 
ask election officials for an investi-
gation. 

A copy of the message, provid-
ed by Pae, listed the addresses of 
all five candidates as the recipi-
ents, with "John Kerry at UCSD-
Opportunity to Speak" in the sub-
ject line. 

Kerry staffer Beth Leonard, 
who was listed as the author, con-
firmed distributing an e-mail, 
though she said she was not 
authorized to verify its content or 
to whom she sent it. 

However, Gallagher said he 
provided the campaign with con-
tact information for all of the can-
didates. Under the circumstances, 
A.S. Elections Manager Tom 
Chapman dismissed York's sug-
gestion that the event unfairly 
favored certain candidates and 
may have violated election bylaws. 

"We provide equal opportuni-
ties for every candidate, but if they 
choose not to take it, we cannot 
force them to do that," Chapman 
said. "Like most things, if they 
choose not to respond, with equal 
notification, they choose not to 
respond."

At the rally, Kerry touched upon 
topics such as the AIDS epidemic, 
the need for stem cell research, 
closing tax loopholes that encour-
age companies to move overseas, 
making healthcare affordable and 
recommitting the country to sci-
ence, technology and discovery. 

"I know there's cynicism, I know 
there's a sense of letdown, that peo-
ple feel the impact of what hap-
pened in 2000 and some people 
think there's no difference between 

one or the other, and some people 
think the promises are just made to 
be broken," Kerry said. "I don't 
believe that." 

After the rally, Kerry attended a 
fundraiser luncheon at the seaside 
mansion of Ron Burkle. 

Gallagher said that many stu-
dents enjoyed having Kerry speak 
on campus and seeing UCSD on 
local and national television. 

"1 think it helped to instill a lot 
of school spirit and a lot of school 
pride," Gallagher said. 

Debate: Candidates discuss 
parking, rising student fees 

continued from page I 
"I'm going to stop cliasing the 

boogeyman in Sacramento," York 
said. "The budget cuts are hitting 
the whole country ... the only way 
to stop (fee hikes) is to bring more 
students into the mix." 

Pae, Cogan and Nandagopal 
stressed the importance of conve-
nient parking for students. Pae 
pledged to work with administration 
to improve planning for parking. 
Cogan proposed a more effective 
shuttle system and cited his experi-
ence working with Transportation 
& Parking Services. Nandagopal 
promised to fight the administration 
on the issue of student parking. York 
argued that the parking problem is 
overblown and that students should 
make use of the Regents parking lot. 

On the issue of student apathy, 
York proposed to increase student 
interest on campus through more 
funding for student media, such as 
SRlV and on-campus publications. 
Nandagopal and Pae proposed to 
increase funding for programming, 
events and athletics to bolster stu-
dent pride and recognition for 
UCSD. Cogan proposed to encour-
age student organizations to work 
and collaborate on campus events. 

Commissioner position debates 
were equally contentious. Brian 
Uiga and Hillary Elder, two candi-
dates for AS. Commissioner of 
Communications, clashed on the 
issue of content-neutral funding, 
Elder speaking of her experience as 
assistant commissioner of commu-
nications. Uiga confronted Elder 
on her record, citing decreased 
funding for the KIIIli4last year. 

"The slcy will turn black ~s coal 
and the oceans will boil with the 
blood of the innocent before 1 see 
you on coundl," Uiga said. 

Unity candidate Emily M.R. 
Castor and independent candidate 
Amilear Diaz, also running for 
Commissioner of Communications, 
did not participate. -

Commissioner for diversity 
affairs candidate and Unity slate 

mem~r Steven Lei spoke unop-
posed and stressed the need to 
improve diversity on the UCSD 
campus. Students First! candidate 
Chris Sweeten was unable to attend 
due to resident advisor meetings 
and illness, but pledged to fight for 
election nonetheless. 

"[I think it hurts my chances), 

but at the same time, 1 just have to 
keep hope and talk to as many peo-
ple as possible on an individual 
basis," Sweeten said. 

In the debate for vice president 
finance candidates, Unity candidate 
Denis Shmidt and Students First! 
candidate Kevin Hanson agreed that 
funding allocation process should be 
streamlined, but disagreed on how 
to reach out to students. I-Ianson 
stressed ties to student organizations 
and Shmidt touted his experience as 
financial controller and vowed to 
reach out to individual students as 
well as student organizations. 

In the debate between vice presi-
dent academic affairs candidates, 
Students First! candidate Caroline 
Song and Unity candidate Jared 
Feldman concurred on their support 
for increased funding for outreach 
programs and ethnic studies classes. 
They disagreed on how to raise 

UCSD~ profile in the humanities 
and social sciences. Feldman pro-
posed to attract more distinguished 
professors, while Song called for 
greater appreciation for instructors 
already on campus. 

Vice president internal candi-
date Melinda Gibson, who is on the 
Unity slate, and Cat Yapyuco, who 
is on the Students First! slate, 
agreed that Associated Students 
needs to increase diversity, but dif-
fered on the source of,the diversity. 
Yapyuco advocated the Students 
First! platform of increasing partic-
ipation from student organizations, 
while Gibson promised to solicit 
more input from all individuals, 
including those who don't partici-
pate in campus organizations. 

Unity conunissioner of student 
services candidate KeUy Vasant also 
spoke unopposed, as Students 
First! candidate Kian Malelri was 
unable to appear. Vasant used her 
time to stress her experience as this 
year's commissioner of student ser-
vices and proposed new marketing 
schemes to promote student ser-
vices, such as student flyers focus-
ing on keywords and catchphrases. 

Neither of the candidates for 
Commissioner of Athletics were 
able to attend, while vice president 
enernal candidate Ri«o Marquez is 
running unopposed.

, " } ; 

T his Sunday, on the oddly alliterative date April 4, 2004 (04/04/04), the 5th annual, highly-acclaimed Fusion hip-hop dance competition will 
kick off once again at UCSD. Eight teams from 

all over California will compete for the coveted first place 
position, and an additional nine acts will perform indepen-
dent exhibitions at the competition, treating all in atten-
dance to a full evening of high-energy entertainment. 

Simply put, Fusion is the largest student-run event at 
UCSD. The 2003 Fusion competition had more than 2,000 
people flood through the RIMAC Arena doors. Rivaling 
the AS.-sponsored concerts FallFest and WmterFest in 
scope, Fusion wiJl take over RIMAC Arena to cater an 
audience numbering in the thousands. But unlike A.S. con-
certs, there aren't any administrators pulling strings. 

No, the responsibility for California's most recognized 
hip-hop competition rests solely on two UCSD student orga-
nizations, the Multi-Asian Student Association and the 
Second-to-None (220) dance team. Five years ago, MASA 
and 220 started the competition to share their love of hip-hop 
dance and culture and to promote community outreach. 

The organizers of Fusion have set high goals for them-
selves this year in trying to celebrate the diverse Pan-Asian 
culture, but the competing teams have also set a goal of 
their own: to win. In the increasingly competitive world of 
hip-hop dance, fueled by the publicity caused by films such 

as "You Got 
Served," every 
competitive dance 
team must fight 
ruthlessly to stay

on top. And, as Fusion has been established as Southern 
California's premiere competition, advancing to the 
national level requires nothing less than first place. It's 
going to be a cutthroat competition, so be on the lookout 
for some amazing moves as the competitors pull out all the 
stops, get down with their bad selves, and do whatever it 
takes to win the judges' favor. , 

And even though some teams aren't competing, they 
will still be in top form. Event hosts 220 will perform one 
of the featured exhibitions, as will visiting artists Cleanup 
Crew with their "Stomp" influenced cacophony. 

But apart from a stellar night of high-caliber perfonnances, 
there is a greater message at work. As the largest Asian-direct-
ed event at UCSD, Fusion is part of a greater effort on the part 
of MASA to rec~ze a Pan-Asian identity for Asian youth at 
UCSD and is only one of the cultural celebrations the group 
holds every year. Composed of members from many diverse 
cultures with many diverse traditions, MASA strives to cele-
brate the diversity of the UCSD community in harmony. 

Which is where Fusion comes in. Over the course of the 
show, audiences will be treated to celebrations of many cul-

tures, be they Asian or otherwise, in the hopes that the audi-
ence will leave the event with something more than a head 
full of catchy tunes and a night full of amazing choreography 
burned onto their retinas. 

Tickets for the show are $12 presale at the UCSD Box 
Office, $13 from Ticketmaster and $15 at the door. 
RIMAC doors open at 5 p.m. The show starts at 6 p.m. For

A I"e you a squeamish person? D o you fa int at the sight of blood ? Can 't stand to hear 
the lineup of horrors night 

after n ight on the local news? Do 
savage truths make you quake at 
your very core? 

Well, then do yourself a favor 
and stay home. New Vi llage Arts· 
latest opus, the intensely dramatic 
documentary "Still L ife." is cer-
tainly not for the squeamish. And. 
as the official Web si te decla res, it 
is also not for children and any-
body suffering from post-traumat-
ic stress disorder. 

We're not talking about your 
run-of-the mill dra ma here. "Still 
Life" is a dramatic experience 

which makes Michael Moore's pre-
tentious "Bowling For Columbine" 
look like an episode of the 
"Teletubbies." It is an extremely 
hard-hitting stage documentary 
addressing the cycle of violence fol-
lowing one soldierli return from 
Vietnam. Through a haze of 
charged words we learn the story of 
the soldier Mark (Francis Gerke) 
and the "real victim of the war," his 
viciously abused wife Cheryl 
(played by Amy Cordi leone). 
Rounding out the cast is Monique 
Gaffney as Nadine. a woman who 
seems to idolize Mark as a gentle 
savant.

No chemistry in 'Prince & Me' 
Contrived plot creates no-brainer film 
By ANNA DYLEWSKA 

Senior Staff Writer 

With "The Prince & Me," director Martha Coolidge brings yet another mediocre 
adaptation of the Cinderella story 
to the screen. T he only good thing 
about the fi lm is that it automatical-
ly wams you about what is to come. 

From the outset it is perfectly 
structured 3S a typical romantic 
comedy. We are introduced to the 
responsible college gi rl, who knows 
exactly what she wants to do with 
her life and who, like a robot, is 
solely concerned with her studies. 
and to the boisterous, spoiled 
prince who is only interested in 
frolicking wi th girls. T he cards are 
laid out, and all the audience has to 
do is wa it for the destined pair to 
meet, hate each other for a while 
and then fa ll madly in love, because, 
after all. opposites attract. 

In th is case, the wooer is 
Edward (Luke Mably). the prince 
of Denmark, and the affected maid-
en is Paige Morgan Gulia Stiles) 
from Wisconsin. The two cuddle 
and display a bit of sexual desire, 
though their relationship cannot be 
described as one filled with intense 
chemistry. Mably is charming at 
times, but predominantly his char-
acter just glides submissively along, 
while Stiles seems essentially to be 
pl ayin g herself- well, except for 
the Shakespeare thing. The direc-
tor probably included Paige's 
adamant declarations about her lack 
of appreciation for the playwright

'Kitchen Stories' cooks up a 
slow but humorous story 

Stunning film uses simple 
cinematography and dialogue 

By ANN SHEN 
Staff Writer 

Deliciously droll and aesthetically beautiful, Bent Hamer's "Kitchen Stories" is a quiet 
comedy about the kitchen behaviors 
of single men. Originally making its 
premiere in January 2003 at the 
Tromso International Film Festival 
in Norway, "Kitchen Stories" has 
earned countless awards throughout 
the year and eventually became thc 
Norwegian entry for Best Foreign 
Language Film at the 2003 Academy 
Awards. Taking ptace in Norway 
after World War U. the narrative 
spins around home science and the 
Sweden Home Research Instirutc's 
work in studying womenli kitchen 
behaviors so that the average house-
hold kitchen can be redesigned in a 
more efficient manner, reducing the 
average distance a woman walks in 
her kitchen-related duties.

Guihlr Mlking exhibit at Geisel 
library change your perspective. 
The exhibit, which runs through 
June 11, details the construction 
of acoustic guitars and shows 

how guitar building is more of 
an art than a science. Four live

Love, revolution and the poli-
tics of each - that's the story 
behind -Don Carlo,· playing at 
San Diego Civic Theatre. The 
1867 opera tells the story of Don 
Cario, who is the 16th century 
heir to the throne of Spain. He 
falls fo r the French princess 
Elisabetta, but soon finds out 
that she is in fact marrying his 
father. To make the triangle even 
more complicated, Princess 
Eboli, Elisabetta's lady-in-waiting. 
is in love with Carlo. Not only 
that, the province of Randers is 
in revolt, turning the love triangle

album 

To anyone sick of standard "verse-cho-rus-verse" pop songwriting, Deerhoof are a godsend. Though the group 
largely utilizes traditional insttwnentatioo 
with the occasional electronics to compose 
their experimental songs, their approach is 
anything but traditional. 

Singerlbassist Satomi Matsuzaki tells 
the story of a strange mythical character 
called "the milk man" who deceives chil-
dren on the buoyant title track. Her child-
ish 'delivery and nonsensical lyrics provide 
the perfect counterpoint to the music, 
which alternates between prog-rock guitar 
interplay and all-out thrash. 

Greg Saunier's forceful drumming 
proves particularly useful in keeping 
things moving while the others play 
heady-but-catchy interlocking riffs . . The 
resulting constructions are often striking-
ly unusual, but the band keeps things light 
with instinctual melodies to serve as 
footholds. 

"Dog on the Sidewalk," which consists of 
nothing more than MalSUzaki chanting "dog 
on the sidewalk" and random electronic 
spuns might scare off casual listeners. But the 
poppy "Milking" and the propulsive 
"Gigadance" are among the most accessible

I ndie-pop royalty Dressy Bessy's self-titled release from Kindercore Records proves they can rock:. Drawing on sig-
nature sugary-sweet guitar roots from 
Apples in Stereo-bred guitarist John Hill 
and the effervescent cuteness of lead singer 
Tammy Ealorn, the full-length album from 
Dressy Bessy feeds their bubble gum pop-
starved fans and provides a solid testimony 
to their talent. 

Tracks such as "Blink Twice" and "Just 
Once More" are infectiously catchy, 'nar-

songs the band has ever created. 

Unlike some left field pop groups, 
Deerhoof never seem to take themselves 
very seriously. On "Desaparacere," 
Matsuuki rhymes misspoken Spanish 
lines like "fiesta fiesta, por supuesta" that 
makes her broken English sound clear in 
comparison. If that sounds too kitschy, 
check out the instrumental "Rainbow 
Silhouette of the Milky Man," a tightly-
wound guitar workout that promotes even 
more toe-tapping fury than the slinkiest 
Strokes number. 

On previous releases such as the wildly 
adventurous Rtvilk and the giddy Apple 0', 
Deerhoof sounded largely unaware of its 
audience, ending songs prematurely or 
stretching them to epic proportions. Milk 
M"" sacrifices a bit of musical identity to 
keep its sonic explosions conservative and 
song len~ manageable. To the uninitiat-
ed, however, the fantastical Millt MII1f will 
sound radically different than most any-
thing else. Few artists are capable of such 
distoned ugliness and melodic beauty with-
in the same album - much less within the 
same songs.

along-in-your-car quality. This eloquent 
attention to the flowery details of a girl's 
life, due in part to Ealorn's songwriting, 
makes Dressy Bessy's music impossibly 
endearing and poetic . 

Including all the bells and whistles, liter-

'Bon Voyage' is a pleasant trip 
Film an' endearing romp through occupied France 

By SAM LOWRY 
Staff Writer 

The German invasion of Europe during World War II is not without its share of screen 
time. From the despair of "The 
Pianist," to the redemption of 
"Schindler 's List," to the quiet 
rebellion of "Jakob the Liar," near-
ly all aspects of this momentous 
event have been covered in 
American film. 

But, as they say, if you want the 
real story, ask the people who were 
there at the time. The Italian pro-
duction "Life Is Beautiful" some-
how managed to intertwine all of 
these aspects together and create a 
half-terrifying, half-madcap come-
dy about the chaos of the time. 
"Bon Voyage," however, leaves out 
all the gut-wrenching drama and 
instead presents us with a period 
piece that spins a simple story of 
intrigue, a la Indiana Jones, with-
out the explosions. 

For all intents and purposes, 
"Bon Voyage" is a comfortable film. 
Shying away from great moral quan-
daries or terrifying visuals, director 
Jean-Paul Rappeneau allows the 
audience to relax and enjoy the act-

ing and melodrama, evoking the 
mood of a 1940s matinee. 

And there's plenty to enjoy 
about the acting. Playing the part 
of a young novelist/adventurer, 
newcomer Gregori Derangere 
spearheads an incredible cast, 
including French superstars 

" 'Ban Voyage' ... presents 
us with a periOO piece that 

spins a simple story of 
intrigue I a fa Indiana 

Janes without the 
explosions. " 

Gerard Depardieu and Isabelle 
Adjani. Derangere's obligatory love 
interest is a lab assistant played by 
Virginie Ledoyen, who spends 
most of the film poured into a tight 
blouse. Despite an easygoing plot 
and several painful cliches center-
ing around a somewhat less-than-
torrid love triangle, every single

REVIEW 

performer in this film carries them-
self with dignity and absolute 
believability. 

The cinematic aspect of "Bon 
Voyage" is equally noteworthy. 
Filled to the brim with visually 
stunning artifacts and locations, 
the production design makes even 
the most mundane events (such as 
looking at bottles in the back of a 
car) compelling and exciting. 
Gabriel Yared's melodramatic 
score is a little more hit-and-rruss, 
soaring to point of parody and 
often undermining any real ten-
sion the movie manages to build. 

But in the end, any smal~ flaws 
or inconsistencies are quite forgiv-
able, as the film's unique brand of 
humor holds the film together 
nicely. Rappeneau's timing is 
impeccable, and he somehow 
manages to tell a "dramatic" story 
with the pacing of a madcap com-
edy. A far cry from the "funny 
action" flicks that plague the mul-
tiplexes filled with mugging actors 
improvising one-liners and post-
kill puns, "Bon Voyage" presents 
an entirely holistic sense of 
humor, where the silliest little 
details often lead to the biggest 
belly laughs. 

Maybe this is why "Bon 
Voyage" shies away from the hor-
rors of its period. But then, is it a 
screwball comedy? Is it an intrigu-
ing spy chase? Is it a cheesy love 
story? None of the above. It's a fun 
two hours, regardless.

Neha 'Hey va' Singh 

It all started on my 7:15 a.m. flight to Oalcland. A man sitting next to me introduced himself as 
a booking agent for the music 
industry and proceeded to tell me 
about how he was on his way to talk 
to an anonymous new young artist, 
and possibly to book her for some 
events. I was half listening to him 
and half dozing off, when my ears 
perked up. He was tallcing about 
how she was not a very good singer, 
but he knew his company would 
make money at prospective shows 
since she was "a gorgeous piece of 
ass." Next, he proceeded to rant 
about how he did not understand 
why Beyonce h as such a huge fol-
lowing when "she needs to lose 
some weight and tone up."

This statement confirmed the 
fact that the art and entertainment 
industry's expectations for artists 
are becoming insanely ridiculous. 
Beyonce is beautiful, a fact con-
firmed by anyone with normal eye-
sight, and by People magazine dec-
laration that she is one of the most 
beautiful people in the world. And 
that new artist the booking agent 
was going to sign on was hardly 
deserving of singing at shows if all 
she has is a beautiful body. My 
hopes of sleeping squashed, I ended 
up arguing with him for the rest of 
the hour-and-a-half flight. 

The saddest thing is that the 
entertainment industry is promot-
ing artists based on looks rather 
than talent. It is amazing that peo-
ple with no talent can have such 
huge success, while others who are 
gifted are left behind. It is rare to 
find someone who is attractive -
by the entertainment industry'S 
standards - and talented (Beyonce, 
no matter what the booking agent 
said, is a great example). Come an,

UCSD 

ring in every heterosexual bay's wet 
dreams. She makes millions of dol-
lars by lip synching at concerts, 
while other musicians are vying to 
find the appropriate channels to get 
a record deal. 

Some argue that the people with 
more talent are the ones who are 
the most popular. It is obvious that

they are living in La La Land. 
Ruben Studdard. the overweight 
winner of "American Idol,» barely 
holds a candle to Clay Aileen, the 
good-looking man who carne in 

second on the show. \\!hile Aiken's 
popularity reaches feverish heights 
despite creepy, stalleer-lilee pop 
songs Iilee "Invisible," you end up 
seeing Ruben more on fewer televi-
sion specials than on MTV, a sta-
tion on which Aiken is a regular. It 
is telling that the industry would 
spend more money to promote 
someone who the American public 
recognized as being less talented 
than another individual. 

A painter friend of mine recent-
ly submitted his portfolio to an art 
gallery in the hopes of being able to 
showcase his worle there. They tOld 
him they were not interested -
news he toole amicably. However, 
he was more than annoyed when 
they went on to tell him they had 
chosen an artist who was very 
handsome and "better for the 
image of the gallery." It is shocking 
that it is becoming socially accept-
able to reject candidates in the art 
world based on their looks, rather 
than their ability. 

Romola Garais role as a sexually 
stifled girl in "Dirty Dancing: 
Havana Nights," is another great 
example of beauty exceeding talent. 

She was great (to look at) while she 
was dancing with Diego Luna, but 
atrocious when she opened her 
mouth. It is not surprising that the 
audience in the theater was actually 
laughing at her desperate attempt to 
act out some "serious" lines at the 
end of the film which simply ended 
up sounding ridiculously cheesy. 
She'd be a perfect addition to "7th 
Heaven." 

Is it wrong to ask for someone 
with both beaury and brains, espe-
cially when we, the consumers, are 
helping them rake in millions of 
dollars each year? Is it too much to 
expect that a singer sing well, that 
an actor act well, and that a painter 
paint well? It is great to have such 
beautiful people in the world to 
look at, but I am simply asking for 
them to also have some talent in 
the field that they fiercely profess 
to be a part of. Otherwise, they're 
better off as models. Perhaps the 
booking agent should switch to 
being a recruiter for a modeling 
agency - that way he'd make a lot 
more money while looking at 
quasi-anorexic women, which is 
exactly the type he covets.

The Raveonettes' 
strange and noisy trip 
Bassist Sharin Fao chats before 

their visit to the Casbah 
ByBIUY GIL 

Associate Hiatus Editor 

Two hot Danes, a warmly received album, mountainous critical acclaim and hype -
sounds like a sure bet, but the 

Raveonettes still struggle to get 
noticed. What's going wrong? 

The Raveonettes, which consist 
of singer/guitarist Sune Rose 
Wagner, singerlbassist Sharin Foo 
and two dudes who never get men-
tioned, have attempted to take 
America by storm with an endear-
ingly twisted brand of chaotic pop. 
Hailing from Copenhagen, 
Denmark, the band combines the 
sweet melodies of early 19605 pop 
with the noise of '8Os rockers like 
Sonic Youth to create a sound that is 
not entirely distinctive (see hun-
dreds of comparisons to the Jesus 
and Mary Chain) 
but brims with per-
sonality. Where 

" 

because you want people to get 
something that has substance," Foo 
says of the faceless rock and pop acts 
that currently rule the airwaves. "In 
the long-run, we'll be around a long 
time. Hopefully the radio will come 
around; the media seems to get iL" 

The Raveonettes often are the 
subject of a warranted comparison 
to '80s a1t-rock progenitors the Jesus 
and Mary Chain, deriving from the 
band's maxim that "louder is better." 
Even the ballads on Cham GlI1Ig of 
Love are scarred by extraneous noise 
that give added weight to the light 
drama of the lyrics. Like theJ&MC, 
the Raveonettes are not big fans of 
fancy chord changes. The debut EP 
Whip It On was recorded entirely in 
the key of B Hat minor (proudly 
advertised on the album jacket) and 
used three chords and less than three 
minutes per song. Chllin GlI1Ig 

their noise-rock 
forefathers were 
abstract, the 
Raveonenes are 
amiable, singing 
funny lyrics that 
mock straight-laced 
pop with seamy 
undercurrents. 

... Our music is quite 
alternative and it's 
not easy to digest. " 

advertises a B flat 
major key and uses 
a wider range of 
sounds, employing 
pulsating beats and 
drastic amowlts of 
static to take the 
amount of noise 
allowed within a 
pop song to a 
higher level than 
usuaUy explored. 

The band has 
been on the road 
for over 14 months, but they show 
no signs ofletting up anytime soon. 
Of the tour, F 00 says tha t after a 
short break they were "hungry" to 
go back on tour, expressing excite-
ment over a new tour with the 
Strokes. 

The Raveonettes are often 
caught saying they're a great band, 
even referring to their records as 
"timeless classics," but it's not hard 
to agree with their lack of humility. 
On Chili" G"'g of Lovt, the band's 
debut full-length, songs typically 
start with handdaps, sing-along 
lyrics and tight boy/girl harmonies 
that bring back that long-lost tradi-
tion of the "rock duet." A closer lis-
ten shows the band's desire to dis-
till the neutered innocence of teen 
pop. On "Little Animal," Wagner 
sings "my girl is a little animal, she 
always wants to fuck" with deadpan 
eamesmess. 

"The radio in the U.S. seems to 
be logged into something that\ very 
disposable, and that's a shame 

Foo under-
stands that the 

nature of the band's music is some-
what at odds with their ambitions. 

"We definitely would love to 
have a number one album, but we 
also recognize that our music is 
quite alternative and it's not easy to 
digest. It sometimes takes people 
that have an understanding of the 
history of rock 'n' roll to get what 
the music is about and get all the 
references and depth of it. " 

The music is fierce, to be sure, 
but it's also pleasurable. The 
Raveonettes aren't about punish-
ing you with their noise, they 
want to make something that 
inspires people to sing along and 
make out in equal amounts. So 
why haven't they broken the 
States yet? Who the hell knows? 
Blame the radio for recycling the 
same old garbage. But don't take 
it out on those pretty Danes -
instead, go see the Raveonettes 
when they play with the Hiss at 
Canes on April S. Tickets to this 
21-and-up show are S14.

Kitchen: Film explores ideas 
of kinship and isolation 

contilUU!d from page I 0 
they took notes on their observa-
tions. The observers were to come 
and go as they please, without dis-
ruption in the subject's life. 

Isak, a brooding solitary farmer 
who participated in order to receive 
a free horse, resents having signed 
up for the experiment, and decides 
to make it excessively difficult for 
Folke. He spends very little time in 
the kitchen, and leaves the light off 
as he eats. Isak also constructs a 
makeshift stove in his room above 
the kitchen so that he can go about 
his business without being 
observed, and then turns the pro-
ject around when he drills a hole in 
the floor of the second story right 
above where Folke sits in his wood-
en throne and spies on Folke as he 
makes his notes. As the observer 
becomes the observed, the two men 
forge a friendship as the story boils 
down to the fact that rather than 
aloof and brooding, the two men 
are lonely. 

Set in the gorgeous winter 
landscape of Norway, the film 
looks like a set of postcards. The 

composition of the screen is still 
and beautiful, as the camera is 
rarely involved in the movement 
of the set. Instead, characters 
move throughout the set as the 
camera sits at mid-range or long-
range, as if watching a play. The 
careful articulation of the story is 
slow, but contributes to the 
atmosphere and art of the narra-
tive. There is very little dialogue, 
and the silence married with the 
still quality of camera shots may 
make it difficult for some to stay 
awake through the film. Although 
not visually stimulating, the 
understated beauty of the cine-
matography is refreshing when 
you need a break from the over-
produced, over-stimulating block-
busters out today.

Their fifth-place finish was • big 
jump from last year's 14th-place 
finish, and their point total of 280 
was almost three times what they 
earned last year. 

Senior co-captain Rob Small 
attributed the team's improve-
ment to team unity as well as the 
hard work and influence of 
incoming swimmen. 

"We had a talented group of 
freshmen and transfers come in. 
They were able to bring in a lot of 
points and they helped veterans go 
a lot &ster in practice. It made for 
a better all-around team," he said. 

Small was touched out in the 
l00-yard breaststroke (56.53 sec-
onds),1eaving him in second place. 
He earned another silver in the 
200-yard breaststroke with a time 
of 2:03 .56. Both times are second-
best in UCSD history. 

Breaststroke proved to be the 
men's strength as well, as Small 
was trailed by junior Bren Going 
and freshman Jacob Dong. 
Going came in fifth in the 100 
(56.98 seconds) and Dong placed 
sixth in the 200 (2 :06.19). 

Freshman Mike Lahey placed 
fourth in the 200-yard backstroke. 
His time of I :48.5 5 was less than 
half a second off the school record. 
He also came in eighth in the 200-
yard individual medley (1 :54.69), 
10th in the lOO-yard backstroke 
(51.03) and 15th in the 400-yard 
individual medley (4:05.53). 

Junio!; transfer John Pearce 
was another principal point-scor-
er for UCSD, coming in eighth 
in the 500-yard freestyle 
(4:38.29), the I,OOO-yard 
freestyle (9:30.16) and the 1,650-
yard freestyle (16:01.37). His 
time in the 1,000 was UCSD's 

second-fastest of all time. 
Sophomore Ben Falcioni took 

fifth place in the 4OO-yard indi-
vidual medley (4:01.39) and 14th 
in the 200-yard individual med-
ley (1:54.66). Once again, the 
men's record boob were threat-
ened as F a1cioni came close to a 
UCSD all-time best in the 400, 
missing it by only a few seconds. 

The UCSD men scored in two 
relays, the 200-yard freestyle and 
the 400-yard medley. In the 200, 
the team of freshman Andy 
Harutunian, sophomore Mike 
Isaacs, junioF Mark Tate and Small 
had the fastest UCSD time in U 
years (1:22.87) and placed ninth. 
In the 400, Lahey, Going, s0pho-
more Barnabus Scla&ni and fresh-
man Tim Fuller placed sixth 
(3:24.70). 

The mens powerful showing 
came as something of a surprise 
to the team. While the coaches 
and the swimmers knew the team 
had improved, Small said that 
they never expected to be in con-
tention for a trophy, an honor 
bestowed on teams earning 
fourth place or better. 

"If you had said last year that 
we'd have a shot at getting a tro-
phy, it would have seemed ridicu-
lous," Small said. "The team real-
ly raised the bar this year. I'm 
proud of how everyone - rook-
ies and rerumees - stepped up in 
a big way.~ 

Coaches and capuins agreed 
that the championships were an 
excellent cap to a season of 
improvement for both the men 
and the women. Although this was 
the final meet, many swimmers 
will continue traininJ. this spring 
with hopes of qualifying for the 
Olympic Trials.

UCSD 7, COlGATE 2 

On March 22, the Tritons shuf-
fled their lineup a bit against 
Division I Colgate, playing without 
Chopra. In doubles, Molden and 
Morton won at No.2 doubles and 
Wilson and freshman Seth Spector 
won at No.3. At No. I, Swatt and 
Nejad lost a dose one, 9-8. 

In sinrles, UCSD won all but 
one matdi. Swan, Novak, Wtlson, 
Molden and Nejad all soundly 
defeated their Colgate counter-
parts in straight sets. 

UCSD 7, W1WAMS 2 

The Tritons played their final 
home match of the season against 
Division ill Williams College. 
Although second-ranked Williams 
rerumed All-American players and 
is the 2003 national runner-up, it 
was simply no match for UCSD. 

Chopra returned to action 
against Williams with the Tritons 
and teamed up with Wilson to beat 
All-American Andrew Murray and 
Daniel Murray, 8-1, while Molden 
and Morton took the second doubles 
point in their 8-6 victory over AII-
American Jeff Kivitz and Scon 
MacKenzie. 

With a 2-1 lead, UCSD secured 
its victory by handily tUing five of 
six singles matches. Swan edged 
Andrew Murray, 7-5, 6-3, while 
Novak notched a win against Daniel 
Murray, 6-J, 7-5. Wilson took care 
of Kivitz, 6-4, 6-3, while Molden 
defeated Urban, 6-2, 6-3. Nejad, 
won against MacKenzie, 6-4, 4-6, 6-

UCSD 6, BONDOIN COLLEGE 0 

On March 23, UCSD won 6-0 
against its Division ill counterpart, 
No. 13 Bowdoin College, at the 
Oahu Tennis Club. Because 
Bowdoin was the home team of the 
mad, both squads played under 
Division ill rules, in which only 
one point is awarded to the team 
that takes at least two out of three 
doubles matches. The Tritons took 
the doubles point with the doubles 
pairs of Chopra-Wilson and Swatt-
Nejad victorious in their matches. 

In singles, Swatt, Wilson, 
Novak, Molden and Nejad breezed 
through their matches in straight 
sets, giving UCSD five more 
points. At No. I singles, Chopra 
took the first set 6-4 and was up 3-
2 in the second before the match 
was halted due to rain. UCSD was 
given the win by de&u1t. 

BYU-HAWAII 6, UCSO 3 

On March 24, the Tritons trav-
eled to Laie, Hawaii, to play BYU-
Hawaii and, despite having an early 
2-1 doubles lead, could not hold off 
the Seasiders in their 6-3 disap-
pointing loss. 

Chopra and Wilson faced the 
top-ranked doubles pair in 
Division II against Jan Krejci and 
Hong Tae Kim, upsetting them in 
their 8-2 win. Meanwhile, Swan 
and Nejad secured the second dou-
bles point in their 8-4 win over 
Dorian Porada and Jeff Rice. The 
only doubles loss was at No. 3 
where Molden and Morton fell, 8-
4, to Dillon Porter and Leon 
So'analole.

Unfortunately for UCSD, it 
could only muster one victory in sin-
gles, in which Swatt edged out 
Porter in straight sets, 6-3, 7-5. 
Chopra, Wilson, Novak, Molden 
and Nejad all dropped their matches 
to their BYU-Hawaii opponents. 

HAWAII PAOAC 8, UCSO 1 

The Tritons continued to strug-
gle the next day as they lost in their 
rematch against Hawaii Pacific, 8-
I. The lone point came from 
WUson and Chopra, who won their 
doubles match. The top-ranked 
Sea Warriors proved to be too 
much for the Tritons as they won 
every other match. 

"In Hawaii, BYU and HPU 
were better than we were," 
Steidl mayer said. "I don't think we 
performed as well as when we were 
at home, and we will have to regain 
that level. However, I do think that 
it was a great experience for our 
players, and that they can definite-
ly improve from it." 

UCSD 5, HAWAlI-HILO 4 

In its final match of the Hawaii 
road trip, UCSD picked up a 5-4 
win against Hawaii-Hilo. 

The Tritons' schedule does not 
get any easier. They play the 
remaining eight matches of their 
regJlar season on the road. 

K[It is) definitely a concern to 
play the rest of the way on the road," 
Steidlmayer said. "Yet, for us to play 
the tough matches we need to 
improve, we need (0 go on the road 
and 6nd them. I think it all depends 
on the mindset of our players. If we 
take it on as a challenge to do well on 
the road, then we are great. If we 
wimp out, then we are in big trou-
ble."

Women's basketball 
bounced out of playoffs 
By mPHEN VONDERACH 

Staff Writer 

The women's basketball season 
ended on March 12 in the first 
round of the NCAA Division II 
tournament and finished with a 
record of 15- 13 overall. UCSD lost 
to undefeated and top-ranked 
Seattle Pacific 79-59 at it's home 
are na. UCSD began its season with 
a los to Seanle Pacific, 89-57. 

This ma rked the first game . 
that UCS D has played in the 
Division J] tou rnament since 
being moved up from Division 
m. 

"We are thrilled about making 
the playoffs since it has been a goal 
of ours si nce we have made the 
transition to Division II," senior 
guard Ali Ginn said. "Playoffs have 
been a !\lotivating factor for us all 
year long, and it is an important 
step in taking our program to the 
next level." 

UCSD was able to hang with 
the top-ranked team for much of 
the first hal f, but Seanle Pacific 
fi nally managed to pull away 
toward the end of the period. The 
Falcons' had the lead 39-3 1 at half 
time. 

Seattle Pacific continued to 
play tough throughout the second 
half and its lead grew until the 
game was well out of reach for the 
Tritons. The Falcons forced 16 
Triton turnovers and committed 
only seven itself. The Seattle 
Pacific defense also held the 
Tritons to 25-percent shooting 
while it shot at over 45 percent 
for the game. 

UCSD, like it has all season, out-
rebounded the Falcons, 49-39. This 
has been UCSD's strong point all 
season, as the Tritons have only 
been outrebounded in six of its 28 
games. 

Freshman guard Leora Juster 
led the Tritons with 12 points, 
going 3-for-9 from behind the arc. 
Ginn finished her UCSD basket-
ball career with 10 points in the 
game. Junior forward Margaret 
Johnson had 11 points and seven 
rebounds, and junior center Stacy 

Gallagher-Bolton grabbed 13 
boards. 

Kristin Poe had a game-high 18 
points and eight rebounds for the 
Falcons, who had three other play-
ers score in double digits. Mandy 
Wood, Michelle Beaumont and 
Amy Taylor all scored at least 10 
points for Seattle Pacific, and 
Brittney Kroon added nine points 
and 12 rebounds. 

Seattle Pacific won 48 its last 49 
home games. The team is perfect 
this season, moving to 28-0 after its 
win over UCSD. 

Ginn knew before the game 
that this was a very good basketball 
team that would be tough to beat. 
"We needed a total team effort to 
win," she said. 

The team looks to improve 
again next year, as it returns 14 of 
its 16 players. Four starters will 
return next year. Sophomore guard 
Andrea Herold with Johnson, 
Bolton-Gallagher and Juster are 
four of the starting five . 

UCSD loses two seniors to 
graduation this year. Seniors Ginn, 
number 25, and Robyn Phillips, 
20, played their last game in a 
UCSD uniform. 

Both Johnson and Ginn were 
named to the A1l-CCM Second 
Team this year. For team co-cap-
tain Ginn, it is her third AlI-
CCAA team. This is her second 
time being named to the Second 
Team, and las t year she became 
the first UCSD women's basket-
ball player to make the First 
Team. She retires as UCSD's all-
time leading scorer with 1,308 
points. 

Johnson earned her first-ever 
A1l-CCAA team selection. She led 
the team in scoring with 12 .5 
points per game and 8.6 rebounds 
per game. She produceaeight dou-
ble-doubles thi s year, giving her 14 
in her career. She has led the team 
in rebounding all three years. 

Together, Ginn and Johnson 
helped lead the team to an 11- 11 
CCAA record, the best in school 
history, and the first-ever appear-
ance in the NCAA Division II 
tournament.

UCSD clinches conference crown 
Women's tennis is undefeated in league play 

BY ANGELA UN 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's tennis 
team defeated No. 23 UC Davis, 
7-2, on March 29, remaining the 
only undefeated team in their 
nine-team California Collegiate 
Athletic Association conference. 
The Tritons, who moved up to 
No. 16 from No. 21 in the 
Intercollegiate Tennis Association 
Division II poll, were able to 
clinch the conference crown with 
only one more league match 
remaining against Cal State San 
Bernardino, rescheduled for April 
16. 

"UC Davis is the only other 
UC school in our conference and 
they've always been tough in the 
past, so we were mentally pre-
pared to play them," captain Julie 
Westerman said. 

The Tritons grabbed a 3-0 lead 
by sweeping the doubles lineup 
against the Aggies. No. 1 doubles 
Westerman and Jasmin Dao 
defeated Nancy Mok and Ally 
Muller of Davis, 8-5, while No.2 
Tara Siddiqui and Kristin 
Bronowicki defeated their oppo-
nents in a quick 8-2 match. Sisters 
Allison and Jenna Ishii completed 
the sweep, defeating Ashley 
Lehman and Amanda Wise in a 
hard-fought 8-6 match. 

"It's been a long time since we 
swept UC Davis in doubles," 
UCSD head coach Liz LaPlante 
said. "We went in with some good 
strategy and it was a great way to 
go into the singles matches." 

Dao highlighted the singles 
matches, with an impressive 7-5, 6-
o defeat over Mok at No.2 singles. 
After fighting off a close first-set 
upset, Dao was aole to overwhelm 
Mok with a quick 6-0 second-set 
finish. Both Siddiqui at No. 4 and 
Marissa Hilker at No. 5 singles 
were able to defeat their opponents 
in two-set matches. The Tritons' 
only two losses came at No. 1 and 
No. 6 singles. 

"We've been doing well in the 
season because we've been playing 
match after match and we've been

gaining confidence along the 
way," Westerman said. 

Over spring break, the Tritons 
played three matches, winning 
against conference opponents 
Grand Canyon and Sonoma State 
and losing to a tough Cornell 
team. The Tritons are now 12-5 in 
the season overall. 

On April 2, the ladies will 
gear up for a big tournament in 
Florida. First up will be the No. 
I BYU-Hawaii, followed up by a 
face-off against No. II Delta 
State on April 3, and finally play-
ing No. 4 West Florida on April 
4. 

"The West Florida Invitational 
will be a great chance to make a 
good showing for the team. We'll 

be facing some very tough teams, 
but we're going to give it our best 
shot and we have nothing to lose," 
Christina Jansen said. 

The Tritons' greatest strength 
this season has come from their 
strong doubles lineup. 

"Our doubles in the past hasn't 
always been our biggest strength, 
but we've been doing very well 
this season and it's been I huge 
help," Jansen said. "When we win 
in doubles, it takes a lot of pres-
sure off the singles because it gives 
us an early lead." 

For the first time ever, UCSD 
will host the CCAA 
Championship at the Northview 
Tennis Courts on April 16 and 
April 17 .

UCSD men's and women's teams place second behind Cornell University

DoubIe-cIoubIe: The UCSO men's and women's track and field teams each 
placed second at the Spring Break Olallenge at Triton Track and Fteid Stadium. 

By MICHAEL SCHOECK 
Senior Staff writer 

The UCSD men's and women's 
track and field teams played host to 
the 2004 Spring Break Challenge 
at Triton Track and Fie.ld Stadium. 
They competed well, but faced off 
against such formidable foes as 
Cornell University, which had its 
Division I men's and women's 
teams defeat the rest of the field. 

The Cornell women scored 213 
points to finish ahead of UCSD 
(172.5), Azusa Pacific (84) and 
Claremont (81), among the 12 
teams total. In the 10-team men's 
field, Cornell produced 200 points 
to come in ahead of UCSD (149), 
Claremont (90.5) and Azusa Pacific 
(75). 

Hernandez performed her usual 
solid work in shot put, with a throw 
of 42-06.75 that landed her in first

THURSDAY, APRIL I, 2004 THE UCSD OUARDIAN 

Crew comes through in the clutch 
Women take Long Beach State despite absences 
By MICHAEL SCHOECK 

Senior Staff Writer 
The women's crew team dis-

played a strong performance 
against Long Beach State on 
March 13, but the loss of several 
key players to illness and other cir-
cumstances weakened the team's 
effort at the Berg Cup, held at 
Newport Harbor on March 27. 

UCSD's women's Varsity Eight 
came in at 7 minutes, 12.8 seconds, 
decisively outpacing Long Beach 
State, which finally crossed the fin-
ish line in 7.31.4. 

However, UCSD's women's 
Varsity Four, was outrun by Long 
Beach State. The Tritons, with a 
time of 8.29.7, came in behind 
Long Beach State, which finished 
in 8.12.1. 

The sheer depth of UCSD's 
teams propelled the varsity team 
forward . 

The first race at the Long Beach 
State regatta was the Varsity Four, 
stroked by senior Stephanie 
Barriere. Senior Alexis Kleckner, 
and sophomores Melanie Kaelberer 
and Kati Monis competed with her. 

Though UCSD came off the 
line with Long Beach State, the 
4gers pushed forward with a high-
stroke rating of 36 strokes a · 
minute, while UCSD raced at 31 
strokes. 

"We looked stronger and better 
technically, but they pulled away, 
and they had their blades in the 
water more ·than we did, so Long 
Beach won by several lengths," 
head coach Patti Pinkenon said. 

The team did not want to make 

the same mistake again of losing by 
a lesser rating again. The Varsity 
Eight defeated Long Beach State 
with a quickened stroke rating. 

"I had time to taIlc with the var-
sity before they went out, and we 
decided we had to go outside our 
comfort zone and take the rating to 
Long Beach," Pinkerton said. 

The tactic worked, and UCSD's 
Varsity Eight boat pulled ahead of 
Long Beach State, thereby lifting 
the stroke rating to 34 against the 
4gers'. 36. UCSD won by several 
crucial lengths of open water. 

"The best thing was the time of 
7: 12.7, which was the fastest ti me a 
varsity crew has rowed since I've 
been at UC San Diego," Pinkerton 
said. 

The Varsity Eight boat was 
stroked by senior co-captain Liz 
Jones, and had seniors Carly 
Moore and Chelsea Smith, junior 
Liz Record and sophomores Cara 
Kuebert, Lauren Ruiz, Dannon 
Hodge and Meghan Kelly. 

Pinkerton was pleased with 
UCSD's efforts. 

"I thought the entire eight did 
an excellent job, but [sophomore] 
coxswain Ariana Pilram called an 
outstanding race," Pinkerton said. 

The team went into the Long 
Beach State regatta with several 
key athletes stricken by illness, 
ineligibility regulations and gradu-
ate school interviews. 

The team prepared for the meet 
with base conditioning and a bit of 
speed work. The team is nonethe-
less at a base rate of 30-3 I. 

The Tritons next set out to 
meet a number of Division I rivals, 

including UC Santa Barbara, UC 
Irvine and University of San Diego 
at the Berg Cup, hosted by Orange 
Coast College in Newport Harbor. 

UCSD encountered tough com-
petition from the Division I foes. 

"It was our goal to close the gap 
against UC Irvine ... they beat us by 
23 seconds the last time we raced, 
three weeks ago," Pinkerton said. 

In the Varsity Eight race, 
UCSD crossed the finish line last 
in 7:00.62. Crosstown rival 
University of San Diego finished 
first with 6:42.8, UC Santa Barbara 
second in 6:43.73 and UC Irvine 
third in 6:53.00. 

"The eight came in fourth, but 
only six seconds behind Irvine, 
with a record time for UCSD of 
7.00.62," Pinkerton said. 

The second Varsity Eight boat 
entered by UCSD also finished last 
in 7:27.41. University of San Diego 
came in at 6:56.6. UC Irvine 
(7:00.7) placed second, Orange 
Coast College (7 :04.47) placed 
third and UC Santa Barbara placed 
fourth (7:12.11). 

Though the team already had a 
Varsity Eight team ready, an injury 
forced Lauren Ruiz out. Stephanie 
Barriere moved from the Varsity 
Four to the Varsity Eight. 

"We were very excited about our 
improvement and our time •.. [but] 
we still under-rated the other crews; 
we raced at 31 strokes a minute and 
the other crews were all at 36," 
Pinkerton said. "I feel strongly that 
we will only get faster as we begin 
lifting our rating, while their speed 
will stay the same, or begin to decay 
as we get to the sharp end of the sea-

end and, for the mOSt pan, we did 
that." 

In the series opener, the Tritons 
jumped to a 4-0 lead in three 
innings. Senior leftfielder Josh 
Saunders smacked a lead-off home-
run in the bottom of the second to 
initiate UCSD's offensive produc-
tion. Later in the third, senior 
catcher Jeff Riddle and Saunders 
stroked back-to-back RBI doubles 
with two outs. Junior third base-
man Alex Gascon drove in 
Saunders with a single up the mid-
dle of the outfield. 

The visiting Seawolves got on 
the board with back-to-back home 
runs to start the fuurth inning by 
junior first baseman Tom Everidge 
and junior right fielder Brandon 
Burgess. At the top of the sixth, 
Everidge delivered again with his 
second home run of the game, his 
ninth of the season. 

After UCSD answered with a 
single run in the bottom half of the 
sixth inning, Sonoma State rallied 
for four runs in the seventh. The big 
blow was a two-run, game-tying sin-
~Ie through the left side of the in6e1d 
by Burgess after Triton junior pitch-
er Shlomo Lipett had replaced 
UCSD sophomore starter Byron 
Grubman. 

In the bottom of the seventh 
inning, however, the Tritons made 
a comeback when senior first base-
man Keith Albrecht roped a single 
to center field that tied the game at 
seven runs apiece. UCSD put up 
two more runs that inning after a 

bases-loaded walk to junior desig-
nated hitter Joel Clark and a wild 
pitch. 

Lipett picked up the win to 
improve to 2-0, while sophomore 
pitcher Ryan Leake retired the 
heart of the Seawolf lineup in order 
in the ninth for his second save of 
the season. 

Saunders continued an impres-
sive hot streak, finishing three-for-
five with his second home run of 
2004, a double, three runs scored, 
and two RBIs. He has hit safely in 
19 of his last 31 at bats for an aver-
age of .613, and has a team-leading 
.492 overall baning average. 
Riddle, Albrecht and junior second 
baseman Ricky Pinocchio all had a 
pair of hits, with Pinocchio scoring 

. twice Ind Clark producing two 
RBI. 

"The team played well as a 
whole this weekend," O'Brien said. 
"Our strength is in the team con-
cept. Anyone in this lineup can beat 
you on any given day, and that's 
what makes us solid. " 

In the doubleheader on March 
27, UCSD senior hurler Raf 
Bergstrom went a full nine innings 
and earned the victory, allowing 
four runs on three hits. Bergstrom 
improved to 4-3 with the win. 

Pinocchio and Gascon each 
went three-for-four in the game. 
Pinocchio had three RBI and three 
runs scored, including a douhle and 
his third home run of the season. 

In game three, UCSD sopho-
more pitcher Jose Navarro tossed 
his fourth consecutive seven-inning 

complete game. Navarro's effort 
held the Seawolves scoreless across 
the board as the Tritons went on to 
shut out Sonoma State 14-0. 
Navarro improved to 3-2 on the 
season with the victory. 

The Seawolves took the series 
closer by a score of 11-4. Sonoma 
Sta te scored 10 times in the third 
and fourth innings combined to 
jump ahead of the Tritons early in 
the game. From there, they tacked 
on one additional run to secure the 
victory. 

UCSD sophomore pitcher 
Logan Boutilier took the loss for 
the Tritons, his first of the season, 
falling to 4-1. 

The Tritons earned the series 
victory by prevailing in three out of 
four games against Sonoma State. 
They improved. with solid play and 
UCSD moved up in the polls from 
14th to lOth nationally in Division 
II baseball . 

UCSD goes on the road this 
weekend, April 2 through April 4, 
to UC Davis to take on the Aggies 
in a four-game CCAA series. 

When asked about the impor-
tance of the upcoming series, 
O'Brien commented on the overall 
focus of his team. 

"We spend a lot of time tallcing 
about playing against the game, not 
against an opponent," he said. 
"There are no big games in our 
mind. When we play solid base-
ball, we're a tough team to beat, 
regardless of who we're playing."

Swimming earns NCAA Division II honors 
Women's team placed third, men placed fifth in N.Y. 
By EVA HOFFMAN 

Staff Writer 
Twenty-eight UCSD swim-

mers traveled to Buffalo, N .Y., to 
compete in the NCAA Division Il 
championships on March 10 
through March 13. The Triton 
women placed third and the men 
claimed fifth . 

Truman State won the women's 
meet with 641 points, \Vhile Cal 
State Bakersfield triumphed on the 
men's side with 718 points. 

The women improved upon last 
year's showing by diminishing the 
point gap between themselves and 
four-time champions Truman State. 
Although the Tritons earned third 
place the past twO years, they trailed 
by only 163 points this year com-
pared to 330 points la t year. 

As it did throughout the season, 
UCSD showed its trength in the 
breaststroke events. Junior Rosanna 
Delurgio came from behind to win 
the 100-yard breaststroke (1 
minute, 2.07 seconds) and the 200-
yard brea tstroke (2 :15.76). In the 
ZOO, she broke her own NCAA 
record as well as the UCSD record. 

Senior Denise Bogard placed 
second in the 100 (I :02.41), just a 
few hundredths of a second behind 
Delurgio. UCSD sophomore 
Louisa Salisbury, took eighth place 
with a time of 1 :06.56. 

Bogard swam an impressive 
meet, placing in the top four in 
three events. She Started the meet 
well, winning the national champi-
onship in the 2oo-yard individual 
medley. Her time of2:04.76 was the 
second-fastest in school history. 
Bogard also claimed fourth place in 
the 200-yard breaststroke (2: 18.67). 

The 50-yard freestyle was 
a nother powerhouse event for 
UCSD. Freshman Emily Harlan

Makine •• es: The Triton women's swim team brought horne third place awards from the NCAA Division II 
championships in Buffalo, N.Y. The men's team finished fifth at the meet 
came in fourth with a time of 23.54 
seconds. Finishing behind her were 
teammates Delurgio, who placed 
fifth (23.57 seconds), and senior 
Carolyn Kwok, who earned eighth 
(24.1 5 seconds). 

Head coach Scott McGihon 
commented on how much stronger 
the team has become in this event. 

"This year we had three people 
in finals and one in the consolation 
heat," he said. "Last year we had 
one in [consolations). That's a 
pretry dramatic improvement in 
one year." 

Earning points in the distance 
events for UCSD was sophomore 

Sophie Levy. Levy claimed twO 
fifth places, one in the 1,0OO-yard 
freestyle (10: 19.39) and one in the 
1,650-yard freestyle (17 :15.54). 
Her time in the 1,000 set a new 
school record. 

Freshman Susan Bell had an 
outstanding first appearance at the 
championships, placing in the top 
six in three events. She placed 
fourth in the 400-yard individual 
medley (4:28.50) and sixth in both 
the ZOO-yard individual medley 
(2 :07 .04) and the 200-yard back-
stroke (2 :06.50). 

UCSD set three school records 
in the relays. Most notable was the 

200-yard freestyle relay, in which 
UCSD went undefeated through-
out the season. At the finals Kwok, 
freshman Liz Whiteley, Delurgio 
and Harlan became national cham-
pions with their time of 1:33.93. 

Kwok, a team captain, was elat-
ed by their accomplishment. 

"We worked so hard through-
out the entire season together, and 
I just feel so lucky to have been 
able to share that experience with 
the three of them," she said. 

The UCSD men moved up the 
ranks at this year's championships.

Baseball 

By CYNTHIA BLADE CHAVEZ 
Sports Editor 

During finals and spring 
break, the UCSD men's tennis 
team faced the toughest stretch 
of its schedule, including match-
es against Division II and 
Division IIIs top-ranlced teams. 
Coming into the midseason, the 
Tritons improved their 7-3 
record, pocketing five victories 
and sustaining three tough losses, 
putting them at 1Z-6 overall with 
a No. 13-ranking in Division II . 

UCSD 6, ROlUNS 3 

An important win for the 
Tritons was their 6-3 home upset 
of Division II's fifth-ranked 
Rollins College on March II. 
UCSD powered through doubles, 
sweeping all its matches. Seniors 
Sameer Chopra and Jeff Wilson,

Groslimond and Matt Umbers, 8-

and senior Nick Monon prompdy 
won against David Tafur and Mike 
Compton, 8-3. 

"[The Rollins match was) a 
very big win," UCSD head coach 
Eric Steidlmayer said. 
"Definitely, the doubles play was 
a key [to the win] . To have Amir 

[Nejad) and Bryan [Swatt) finish 
off the sweep was a huge deal; 
then we went out and really com-
peted and played well." 

With an early 3-0 lead heading 
into th.e singles portion of the dual 
match, the Tritons secured the 
upset by winning No. 3, No.4 and 
No. 5 singles in straight sets. 
Junior Emil Novak got past 
Groslimond, 6-2, 6-2 at No.3, 
followed by Wilson's win against 
Umbers, 6-3, 6-2 at No.4.

6-0, 6-3. Nejad battled for three 
sets in his match, but lost against 
Drew Spika, 1-6,6-3,6-4.

Senior Staff Writer 
The No. 10 UCSD baseball 

team held off defending California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
conference champion Sonoma 
State in three of four games at 
Triton Baseball Stadium March 26 
through March 28. UCSD inched 
out the series opener, 9-8, then 
took games two and three, 9-4 and 
14-0, respectively. The Seawolves, 
however, battled back in the closer 
and won game four, 11-4. The 
Tritons are now 24-12 overall and 
15-9 in the CCAA-

"I'm very proud of the way we 
competed in the first three games 
of the series," UCSD head coach 
Dan O'Brien said. "Our goal is to 
outplay our opponent every week-

Aguilar claims resconsibili~ 
for physical assau t of Koala 

By JOSH TAYLOR 
Staff Writer 

In a move coinciding with the 
ejection of The /(01114 from cam-
pus, Director of Student Policies 
and Judicial Affairs Nicholas S. 
Agui lar has issued a statement 
claiming responsibility for a phys-
ical altercation last year that left 
several KOiIIII affiliates severely 
beaten. 

KOfllfl, the 
beating had 
yet to be 
accounted 
for before 
Aguilar's 
statement, 
although 
witnesses 
descri bed it 
as a "com-
plete ass-
kicking." 

"If I had

stated. "That's what I call student 
policy." 

Coming in the wake of the 
controversial "Jizzlam: An

Islamic Man" edition of the 

known they were such pussies, I 
would have brought Ernesto

security guard and claiming to 
have discovered damage to said 
KoIIIII member's automobile. 
Aguilar then proceeded to beat 
down the KotI14 member and a 
score of friends that came to his 
defense, according to the adminis-
trator. 

Campus administrators have 
yet to release a statement on 
Aguilar's admission, although 
champagne was rumored to be 
flowing in the Faculty Club. 

"For every action .... ," Acting 
Chancellor Marsha A. Chandler 
said between flutes. "Content 
neutrality or no, they got what 
they fucking deserved ." 

UCSD Police have yet to take 
action on the admission, primarily 
because nobody really gives a fuck 
about the KOfl14. How many of 
them actually go to this school, 
anyways? And who's that longhair 
that smokes cigars all the time?

Watson says prank is 
final straw, went too far 

By MARY LI 
Staff Writer 

Members of The Koala were 
arrested March 31 for fraud and 
property damage after allegedly 
replacing pages of the UCSD 
Guardian's last issue with its own 
pages in an apparent prank. The 
estimated damage is over $1,500. 

The Koa14 content, found on 
pages 15 to 18 of the March 29 
issue of the Guardran, contained a 
full-page illustration of a "Trojan 
koala, " party reviews and an 
advertisement for photographs of 
Koala editor Bryan Barton, among 
other articles . Several statements 
from the Koa14 bragging a bout the 
feat were also featured in the four 
substituted pages. 

GUIlrdian advertising manager 
Michael Foulks said $1,165 in 
advertising revenue had to be 
returned to clients who bought ad 
space on the lost pages, and that 
the last-minute substitution caused 
an additional $340 in late fees from 
the printer. 

The paper will seek full com-
pensation for the immediate dam-
ages as well as for the lost business 
from current customers who have 
complained about their businesses' 
association with the "offensive" 
material placed by the Koala, 
Foulks said. 

Guardian management con-
tacted UCSD Police upon arriv-
ing to campus March Z9 and see-
ing the Koa14 pages where pages of 
the features section were slated to 
appear. GUIlrdilln Editor in Chief 
Evan McLaughlin said the March 
29 issue did not have the /(oala

content included inside when he 
dropped the paper 's proof sheets 
off at San Diego Web Design 
Offset, the EI Cajon printer used 
by both the Grul1'dlllll and th e 
Koala . 

"Honestly, there had to be 
some connection with the prim-
er," McLaughlin said . "The last 
time I saw the paper there we re 
features articles and a crossword 
on those page , not that horse-
shi t. " 

Vice Chancello of Student 
Affairs Joseph W. Watson said the 
administration conducted a con-
current inve tigation with UCSD 
police, and that the 1\00111'5 A.S. 
media charter has been suspended 
indefinetl y d~e to the allegations. 

UCSD Police detained and 
arrested three Koala members at 
the Media Lounge in Student 
Center two days after the event. 
Former KOllla Editor George 
Liddle, member Mike Nitzani and 
Barton were handcuffed and led to 
a nearby patrol car before being 
transported to Central Jail. 

The investigation is sti ll active, 
UCSD Det. Chris Quinn said, and 
other arrests may be made as more 
evidence is obtained by authori-
ties . 

The arrested KOllla members 
were unavailable for comment. 

Members of the UCSD com-
munity arrived to campus March 
29 and discovered the substituted 
page. Many readers said tney were 
surprised and confused at the con-
tent in the issue, but were even

I BORING 
Computer crash leaves 

Computer Science major 
with no Friday night prans 

Earl Warren College freshman George 
Hang's Linux workstation crashed at approxi-
mately 7:49 p.m. on March 26, ruining his 
plans for a "fun-filled night of adventure and 
excitement." Hang had originally intended to 
write some programs that were assigned 
earlier that day, teach himself a new pro-
gramming language, play some Dungeons 
and Dragons, then "maybe chat with some 
hot chicKs." 

"I don't know what happened," Hang 
said. "My Linux system is usually much 
more reliable than Windows. The open 
source code is just far superior. Bill Gates 
sucks; I hate him. You're not printing this, 
are you? I don't want him to hunt me down 
and suck my brains out." 

Last spirited UCSD student 
has spirit crushed 

Eleanor Roosevelt College junior Shirley 
Chavez, the last spirited UCSD "Triton: lost 
all feeling for the UCSD campus March 25 
while attending a men's fencing match 
against Cal State Hayward. Attending her 
28th-straight fencing match, Chavez finally 
realized that giving a shit was for dum bass-
es when she realized that her cheering had 
no impact whatsoever. 

"At first we just thought she was a stalk-
er: fencing team memoer Kent Thompson 
said. "But she kept on showing up, week 
after week. She was always shouting or 
something. but we couldn't really make out 
what she was saying through our masks." 

In her three years on campus, Chavez 
has often skipped dasses to attend UCSD 
sporting events, bringing face paints and 
posters to every event. She still possesses

RSO suspects student of 
consuming alcohol 

RSO Rebecca Jones suspected Sixth 
College freshman Ricky Aubrey of consum-
ing alcohol at 12:38 a.m. on March 27. 
Despite smelling alcohol and observing his 
drunken gait, Jones declined to write him 
up after speaking with him, deciding to give 
him the benefit of the doubt. 

"Most college students are serious about 
their studies and know that consuming alco-
hol is a serious health risk: Jones stated. 
"Maybe he got a cut and disinfected him-
self. And maybe he suffers from vertigo. I'm 
willing to give a UCSD student the benefit 
of the doubt. I think they've eamed it~ 

Aubrey remains passed out in Lot 706, 
where he collapsed following the RSO's 
departure three days ago. 

Berzerkeley shamed by 
element renaming 

Berkelium has been renamed Tritonium, 
the Intemational Bureau of Standards 
announced March 27. The name change for 
the 135th known element caught many at 
UC Berkeley by surprise, causing many sci-
entists previously working at Lawrence 
Livermore National Laboratory to relocate to 
UCSD's fled~ing nuclear reactor site just 
south of Scnpps Institute of Ocean?8raphy. 

'We'd actually been expecting thiS for 
some time," said UCSD chemistry professor 
Jim Weir. ''They are communists, after all." 

Other reasons cited for the name 
change include Berkeley's "abominable 
stench" and the campus's general "sucki-
ness."

Happy April Fool's Day! 
Next In line: 
Apologies go out to 
our friends, " 
roommates, co-
workers and those 
on staff who were 
told a bold-faced lie 
about the Koo/Q 
being in our last 
issue. Especially 
Neil Spears, seen 
here kicking Evan 
after speaking at 
public input of the 
A.S. Council 
meeting without 

RicIIIId c.1IINtrIttn/0Ut rI __ biIdt actually being in on 

more surprised when they found 
out that the entire thing was an 
April Fool's Day prank. 

Happy April Fool's Day. 
Laughing yet? Pissed? 

Embarrassed' Maybe you weren't 
fooled one bit. 

And we certainly didn't mean to 
make you cry. 

The &alii and GIIIlrJilm engi-
ncered this prank together. Why did 
we work with the most despised 
organization on campus? A publica-
tion that makes anyone with a pulse 
nauseous after the first page or 
dozen Bryan Barton photos 
(whichever comes first)? What about 
all of the hate speech the KMM has 
become notorious for, not just at 
UCSD but up and down the state? 

That's the point. It's unlikdy that 
the straight shooters at the ~ 
would do anything besides procIaim 
that Transformers took OYer the UC 
Board of Regents, or that Ben 
AlBecIc was named chancellor after 
long and arduom consultation with 

it We forgot. sorry. 
tarot cards and boobie tassles? 

First, there's already another 
campus publication that pulls those 
"wild and crazy" stunts. And also, 
that is the typical DisrtgwrJitm 
JXIIlIc- Not that it's stale - some 
variation of those stories will proba-
bly grace future April 1 issues. But 
when approached with this concept, 
we had an opponunity to pull an 
extraordinary prank. When the 
combined wages of the three 
Gurdilm managers are roughly 
equal to minimum wage while piec-
inJ. ~ther a product that only gets 
picked up for the crossword puzzle 
anyway, a monumental pranIc was a 
no-brainer. 

What would. bar none, be the 
hugest stDry of the year? Of your 
career at UCSD? 

It's hard 10 find one biger than 
the authorities finally getting its 
claws in the KtttU6. 

To' successfully make this prank 
believable, we had to include the real 
thing. H we made the "sabotqed"

content about daffodils and teddy 
bears, the stunt would be less believ-
able. The GwmJiJm apologizes for 
any offense taken by readers about 
the cootent included in the KMM's 
infcc:tion. As jowuaIists covering this 
campus, we are aware that many are 
sensitive to the just the name KMM 
alone because ol their past record. 
We are not. There was a time when 
they were funny, and now they basi-
cally spank each other and con-
tribute nothing positive to the cam-

were subjected to their "hwnor" 
when you picked up our paper think-
ing there was a crossword on page 
17, and we apologize you didn't get 
your cn:xmword on Monday, but we 
will not apologize for &ee speech of 
an organization But that's sti1J miss-
ing the point of why we did this. 

This prank was not for a political 
purpose ol any kind. It was to set the 
awrage srudent WIring 10 another 
average student about something

besides O-chem. If persons or groups 
want to make this a political issue, 
that's their prerogative. The

issue and it was kind of interesting to 
see the reactions of persons on cam-
pus.

after that. 

H you're going to Vegas,

The only way not to be dri-

You don't drink it as much as 
you consume it. Walk the strip 
only if you 've never been, 
because you're wasting energy 
that can be spent at some over-
priced club or at a piano bar 
wailing Bon Jovi 's "Living on a 
Prayer." During the day, girls go 
to Caesar's and looks at all the 
stuff they want to buy and guy's 
hit up the Venetian's sportsbook 
to slowly get sauced while losi ng 
the value of "Calculus: Early 
Transcedentals" because Philly 
didn't cover the spread. 
Occasionally visi t O'Shea 's for 
some cheap sustenance, and then 
get back o n the sauce. 

Lastly and most importantly, 
never under any circumstance 
volunteer to drive back from 
Vegas. There is nothing more 
humiliating. 

Parking more impor.-
tant than ropes courses 
H !storical~y, tJ:te park-mg sItuation at UCSD has been a 
travesty. Each year, it gets 
increasingly more difficult to 
find a parking space on cam-
pus, and now the adminis-
tration's decision to com-
pletely eliminate parking is 
the wrong choice for the 
UCSD community. 

At its March 29 meeting, 
the Parking Committee 
voted 11 -0 to eliminate all 
parking on campus. 
Effective immediately, park-
ing lots instead will be 
devoted to 16 ropes courses. 
Parking passes will not be 
refumlabJe, and lots will be . 
blocked off bv UCSD 
Police. . 

The committee did not 
thoroughly weigh this deci-
sion. nor Jid it take it seri-

ou~ly. :--:0 students attended 
the meeting, so the commit-
tee was able to vote on the 
measure quickly and effort-
lessly. UCSD will lose 
approximately $50 rnillion 
per year in parking pass 
sale, but one commJttee 

member justified loss with 
the added benefit of "lots of 
ropes courses, whatever 
those are." In fact, at several 
points durin~ the meeting, 
one commIttee member 
repeatedly excused himself 
as he was overcome with fits 
of gigg-Ies. 

ThIS is wrong for several 
reasons. With such a large 
commuter body, it is igno-
rant to assume that parking 
spots can be eliminated, 
even if everyone loves a 
ropes course. Students, 
staff and facultY will be 
forced to park on the mean 
streets of La Jolla, where 
they will encounter the 
notoriouslv mean rich 
elderly resrdenrs. 

Furthermore, the shu ttle 
system is not fully loaded 
enough to handle such a 
flow of students that will be 
forced to park off campus 
and shuttle their way in. 
Already the shuttles are full 
of bad music, loud cell 
phone conversa tions, peo-
ple whose bags needs seats 
and the occasIOnal bus slut.

The opinion articles in

ed my safe space. My safe

entire time spent studying 
abroad has been ruined, 
knowing that such abrasive 

filth has been published by 
UCSD's campus newspa-

After reading the winter 
quarter issues, I researched 
the checkered history of 
your publication and 
found, to my dismay, that 
the issues from Aug. 25, 
1982 through Jan. 1, 2004 
also contain opinion 
columns that offend me as 
a student and as a former 
10-year-old child. Their 
authors obviously sought 
to hurt me in my vulnera-

have they achieved their 
goals. My entire life has 
been ruined. 

Wiping- away my tears

publication has been 
offending me in my previ-

zygote, unfertilized egg, 
and as the carnal impulses

Scooby 000 2 sucks no matter how 
sloned you could possibly be 

., HANNAH I. GUNN 
Staff Writer 

ZoinJcs! "Scooby Doo 2: 
Monsters Unleashed" is, without a 
doubt, the greatest kids movie to 
come out in a long time. The mak-
ers of "Finding Nemo" and 
"Shrek" should be ashamed of 
themselves for churning out such 
drivel when Warner Bros. and 
Mosaic Media Group have collabo-
rated to make such an unparalleled 
masterpiece. 

A talented young cast depicts 
the classic supernatural crime-
fighters of Mystery Inc. If you 
missed out on "Scooby 000" car-
toons from the Saturday mornings 
of yesteryear, man did you miss out, 
'cause Scooby 000 was like the 
most awesome canine ever. He ate 
a ton of food and he could almost 
talk find he was part of a detective 
agency that solved crimes commit-
ted by ghosts and demons and stuff. 

And this movie was the best tele-
vision series to movie adaptation, 
ever. Better than "The Fugitive," 
better than "Starsky and Hutch," 
better even that "J Spy." And how 
was such an achievement accom-
plished? Well, first and foremost, the 
cast is amazing and they have such 
great chemistry. Freddie Prinze, Jr., 
one of the most talented actors of 
your generation delivers a nearly 
Oscar-worthy perfonnance in his 
uncanny portrayal of Fred. Sarah 
Michelle GeUar kicks more super-
natural butt, clearly her true calling, 
as the violet-inclined Daphne. 
(Damn .. . those legs! No wonder 
Fred is so hot for her.) Linda 
Cardenelli is absolutely breathtaking 
as Velma. the oh-so-sexy-nerd of 
Mystery Inc. But the one person 
who really steals the show is 

Film 
REVIEW 

Matthew Lillard as Shaggy. His por-
trayal of the original cartoon Shaggy 
- physical mannerisms, voice, the 
whole nine yards - sets a paradigm 
for all other actors to follow (listen 
up, Meryl Streep). 

Complimenting this superb act-
ing are the excellent cinematography 
and special effects. Scooby 000 
actually looked, moved, and sounded 
like a real dog, well apart from the 
talking and dancing and stuff. And 
the computer animated monsters 
and villains made Gollum from 
"The Lord of the Rings" look like a 
cartoon. 

The storyline was absolutely 
flawless. Charlie Kaufman could 
take lessons from James Gunn , 
William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. 
But know what's even more impres-
sive? They totally kept the same feel 
of the original Scooby Doo shows. 
The humor was completely innocent 
and the personalities of the charac-
ters shone through the super writ-
ing. None of those naughty refer-
ences to "size," sex, or other inap-
propriate crap like in "Shrek" or 
"The Road to EI Dorado." ]inJcies l 
Way to go guys!

Triton football program debuts in loss to USC 
Division II opener marks new era in athletics at UCSD 

By BRIAN FELLOWS 
That's crazy! 

After a year-long series of 
undisclosed conferences with 
NCAA officials, the UC Regents 
and university officials, the UCSD 
Intercollegiate Athletic Association 
announced the unveiling of a 
Division II football program to be 
revealed in the fall of 2004. Former 
University of Alabama coach Mike 
Price has been hired for the 
Tritons's inaugural season. 

"For years, many students have 
been asking for a football team and 
football will finally be a reality," 
UC D enior Associate thletic 
Director Ken Gro se said. 

Tryouts were held from March 
15 through March 26. The rOster 
was finalized shortly thereafter and 
the Tritons played an exhibition 
match against defending national 
champions U C at the Ro e Bowl 
in Pa adena, Calif. 

urprisingly, the Tritons kept 
up with their opponents in their 
28-24 loss. 
. "This is awesome," Price said . 
"} am exci ted about our potential , 
and our W IO over the defending 
national champions is ignificant. 
Even if it was only an off-sea on 
exhibluon game against U C, we 
know we are good enough to be the 
champions that we are." 

The CAA will announce the 
addition of UCSD into Divi Ion 11 
10 the Independent Conference in 
a press briefing on April 2. In addi-
tion, the football team will be the 
only program allowed LO offer ath-

letic scholarships to its athletes. At 
the present time, the UC Regents 
and university officials are dis-
cussing athletic scholarships for the 
other sports, namely women's soc-
cer, which has earned numerous 
national championship crowns 
despite the lack of scholarships. 

T he Tritons' home colors will 
be gold and blue while the road 
colors will be white and blue; the 
helmets will be white with a blue 
"T" embossed on the side. To echo 
the tradition of colleges such as 
Ohio State and Florida tate, small 
tickers of the Triton's scepter will 

be placed on helmets of player 
who demonstrate excellence on the 
field . 

Pending construction of a foot-
ball tadium in the empty lot along 
Regents Road, the football team 
will temporarily play its home 
game on RIMAC field. In addi-
tion, ICA has contracted with ABC 
and will have three of their games 
nationally televi ed including their 
games against tanford, UCL and 
USc. 

"We are excited about the rev-
enue our football program will 
generate," Gro se aid . "We hope 
some of the profit will go towards 
opening doors for our other sports 
to receive cholarships and eventu-
ally move up to Divi ion 1." 

UCSD will continue to play 
four exhibition games against other 
Division I and Divi ion II teams 
during the spring and summer and 
will have occasional scrimmages 
with cross-town rival an Diego 
State. Four of the exhibition games

will be played at RIMAC Field and 
all scrimmages against SDSU will 
be played at Qualcomm Stadium. 

Leading the Tritons in their 
inaugural season will be the off-
spring of a crop of former NFL 
legends such as freshman quarter-
back Bobby Namath, son of Joe 
Namath, running back William 
Payton, son of Walter Payton and 
defensive lineman Frank "The 
Freezer" Perry, son of William 
"The Refigerator Perry." 

"I have a lot of confidence in my 
teammates," Namath said. "I know 
we can play competitjve and prove 
to everyone we belong in Division 
1." 

Namath went 12-for-18 with 
two touchdown passes to wide 
receiver Tapio Sammalkangas, a 
junior transfer from Michigan. In 
addition, Payton rushed for 103 
yards including two touchdowns 
and Perry recorded four sacks, 
including a third down sack late in 
the fourth quarter. 

For the Trojan, junior Matt 
Leinart went I -for-21 with four 
touchdown passes to sophomore 

teve mith. Leinart admitted his 
surpri e at the TritOns's phenome-
nal level of play. 

"After winning the national 
championship, I figured it would 
be easier to beat UCSD since 
they've never played," Leinart said. 
"But, they have chemistry as a 
team. They came out trong and 
they're definitely a team to watch 
out for next season."

Crew implicated in vandalism scandal 
Controversy raised as most of regatta field sinks 

By J. CREW 
Pretentious O.c. Store 

The UCSD men's and 
women's crew teams have been 
tentatively banned from competi-
tion this week on allegations of 
tampering with and vandalizing 
opponents boats in the final days 
prior to the highly-anticipated 
San Diego Crew Classic. 

On March 28, two members of 
the men's varsity eight boat were 
suspiciously found in possession 
of a drill and lead weights as well 
as other materials in the San 
Diego State boat house. After the 
issue was brought to official's 
attention, various other competi-

tive crew programs came forward 
with complaints that saboteurs 
resembling members of UCSD's 
teams have been witnessed lurking 
about other boat houses. 

Magic Johnson and Nick 
Lachey, head coaches of the men's 
and women's crew programs at 
Long Beach State University, sub-
mitted petitions to NCAA offi-
cials claiming that their boats 
were lit aflame and cast into 
Newport Harbor over sometime 
in the early morning hours of 
Match 24. Although nobody has 
been charged in the crime, UCSD 
men's varsity captain Eric Kuhle 
has been identified as the primary 
suspect and has been unable to 

~ccount for his whereabouts on 
the night in question .. 

"We find these charges to be 
outright preposterous," said men's 
head coach Mark Davis. "Eric 
couldn't do aU that without the help 
of at least one of his teanunates." 

The San Diego Crew Classic is 
scheduled to take place over the 
weekend of April 3 and April 4, 
but as many as 12 teams have had 
to forfeit the competition already 
on account of severely damaged

"It's not our fault, those are all 
lies I tell you," said Joe Schmoe.

Bobby Knight to coach men's hoops 
New coach enlisted to motivate lackluster team

Senior Associate Athletics 
Director Ken Grosse recently 
approved hiring Bobby Knight, 
formerly of Texas Tech, to as the 
UCSD men's basketball head 
coach. Knight joins UCSD as the 
next step in a long and successful 
career of developing collegiate 
basketball programs into nation-

Knight said. I am going to sepa-
rate the men from the boys and 
send the boys home crying to 
their mothers."

view, Knight took judo classes and 
mastered the art of choking with-

ticed throwing folding chairs that 
the athletic department recently 
ordered.

is with the coach, not players.

former coach Greg Lanthier who 
had a miserable 9-300 record. A 
ticker tape parade was held at 
·Library Walk and Price Center to 
celebrate his long awaited depar-
ture,
