“ I want you crawling back to me down on your knees, yeah/ Like an appendectomy sans anesthesia.”
THE MAGNETIC FIELDS

“YOU MUST BE OUT OF YOUR MIND”
PAGE 8

By Xue Mao 
Staff Writer

After campaigning on a 
platform last year that prom-
ised to bring a football team 
to UCSD, A.S. President 
Utsav Gupta is postponing 
those plans until at least Fall 
Quarter 2010, and is instead 
exploring an overhaul of the 
athletics department.

A meeting between Gupta 
and Director of Athletics Earl 
Edwards last week led to the 
conception of three different 
options for an athletics refer-
endum. Because Edwards deter-
mined that the options need to 
be further researched in terms of 
feasibility, no mention of a football 
team will appear on the Spring Quarter 
election ballot.

Gupta said that this postponement 
would put the referendum under the voting 
power of the 2010-11 council. 

“We’re not pursuing it this quarter,” 
Gupta said. “Voting will depend on the next 
student council. And this will probably hap-
pen in [the] next year.”

Instead of solely focusing on the creation 
of a football team, the new options look to 
upgrade UCSD athletics teams to Division-I. 
As it stands, all UCSD athletic teams are 
Division-II except volleyball and water polo, 
which do not have separate national divi-
sions.

The first and original option Gupta has 
proposed for next year’s A.S. Council — 
which would cost students $20 per quarter — 
is the creation of a D-II football team.

The second option would upgrade all 
UCSD athletic teams from D-II to D-I, as well 
as create a D-I football team.

The final option would upgrade all UCSD 
athletic teams from D-II to D-I without the 
addition of a football team.

According to Edwards, UCSD teams do 
not currently compete against schools of 
the same academic caliber due to their D-II 
standing. He said this might contribute to the 
lack of enthusiasm students exhibit toward 
athletics.

“Having a [D-II] football team doesn’t 
make sense if we only have one team to play,” 
Edwards said. “This plan is not so much 
about moving to D-I than to compete against 
schools more like UCSD. We don’t have 
much in common with the schools we’re 
playing against right now.” 

Moving to D-I would involve competing 
against schools such as UC Riverside, UC 
Irvine and UC Davis.

Gupta is highly in favor of the sec-
ond, most extreme option — which would 
advance all UCSD athletics to D-I in addition 
to creating a new D-I football team — and 
said the current delay in the referendum will 
be worth it in the long run.

“We’re trying to move all our teams to 
D-I,” Gupta said. “That’s worth holding off a 
quarter or two on the question.”

The A.S. Council and the athletics depart-
ment are hiring a fiscal consultant to evaluate 
the cost of all options.According to Edwards, 
the cost would be in the millions. The selec-
tion process for the consultant will begin next 
month.

Specialized tracks within social sci-
ence majors may be reduced, said A.S. 
Social Sciences Senator Irfan Ahmed, who 
announced the proposal at the Jan. 13 A.S. 
Council meeting. 

The proposal is a potential solution for 
offsetting the recent decrease in state funding 
for the University of California, and was sug-
gested by Dean of Social Sciences Jeff Elman.

Currently, majors such as political science 
and international studies allow students to 
specialize in secondary tracks that are supple-
mentary to their core requirements. These 
tracks make majors interdisciplinary, empha-
size subjects such as anthropology, history, 
communications, linguistics and literature to 
offer students a more diverse education.

Under Elman’s proposal, these existing 
tracks would be combined to create fewer 
and broader subjects of focus. 

According to Ahmed, the budgetary defi-
cit is the motive behind the proposal. 

“The department is looking at a 20-per-
cent budget cut from the state: a $60 million

W ildfire doesn’t have shit on the spread of dubstep. The slow, wompy darker-sister of the electronic club beat only leaked out the London back-alleys five short years ago; now, propelled by entertainment 
capitalists the planet over — each determined to be the first to expose the 
underground — dubstep is under death threat of overpopularity.

UK originals are being flown into LA, dangerously visible under the 
Hollywood magnifying glass. Top-40 leeches like Snoop Dogg, Rihanna 
and Britney Spears are catching wind — kicking sparse Lil Jon jangles for 
the slugging halts and screeches of dubstep (albeit at its safest and sim-
plest). Even Wu-Tang tried to ride the sparks of the exploding scene with 
a disc of classic verses remixed by “indie” dubstep producers.

I mean, fuck — as of three weeks ago, UCSD has its own dubstep club. 
That’s when you know the hip factor has blown.

At last night’s A.S. Council meeting, a proposal 
to change student-media regulations — which would 
have mandated administrative supervision of coun-
cil-funded publications — was shelved indefinitely 

after representatives from student 
publications such as the Koala, the 
Muir Quarterly and the Sixth Sense 
showed up to protest. They argued 
that the guidelines would impose on 
free speech and hinder the growth of 
new media. 

The proposal’s failure did not come 
as a surprise to Campuswide Senator Adam Kenworthy, 
who helped draft it along with Marshall Senator Brian 

McEuen, Revelle Senator Jaclyn Storey and Associate 
Vice President of Student Organizations Andrew Ang. 
At an open forum held Jan. 26, Kenworthy suggested 
that media representatives focus instead on the more 
realistic possibility of a media review board.

“I think we’re pretty certain this is going to fail,” 
Kenworthy said at the forum. “I don’t think we should 
even be talking about this right now. My favorite part 
of this legislation is the media review board.”

Kenworthy and Ang announced their plans to 
begin drafting a new proposal that would eliminate 
the faculty sponsorship aspect entirely, and priori-
tize the creation of a media-specific board to handle 
funding.

As it stands, all campus organizations — includ-

TWO COKES SHORT By Sam Pelle

ing newspapers and magazines — 
receive their quarterly funding from 
the Student Organization Funding 
Advisory Board. The media review 
board would consist of A.S. mem-
bers, students and representatives 
from publications who would deter-
mine funding for media orgs. 

The media guidelines weren’t 
the only pieces of legislation to 
hit a roadblock; a referendum that 
would have granted the Loft around 
$810,000 in funds was tabled for 
later discussion after it was rejected 
by the Graduate Student Association 
on Jan. 25 and councilmembers 
were forced to rewrite the proposal.

The GSA was unwilling to ask 
graduate students to vote on a man-
datory fee of $3.82 on the Spring 
Quarter ballot. Councilmembers 
felt that they needed more time to 
review the new legislation, since the 
quarterly fee for undergraduates 
would now be $4.47 instead of $3.82. 

“I am not one of the privileged 

ones who’ve seen the new lan-
guage [of the Loft referendum],” 
Vice President of Student Life Ricsie 
Hernandez said. “I’d like to at least 
see what changes were made and 
offer amendments.”

Things got heated between councilmembers at last night’s meeting as they 
argued over legislation and the 
impeachment of absent council-
members.

The forum was crowded with 
members of student media organiza-
tions, who vocalized their opposition 
to the A.S. media guidelines proposal. 
However, the 
media guidelines 
were postponed 
indefinitely and 
therefore were not 
up for discussion 
at this meeting. 

Campuswide 
senator Bryant Pena, who attended 
the Housing, Dining and Hospitality 
planning committee meeting, said 
HDH is looking into raising prices of 
dorm rooms. 

Warren senator Alyssa Wing 
challenged Muir senators Ryan 
O’Rear and Lynne Swerhone to a 
Spirit Night bet. Warren College, 
currently in the lead for Spirit Week 
points, would wear Muir College 
clothing if Muir ended up outshow-
ing them at the basketball games in 
RIMAC Arena this Saturday. O’Rear 
and Swerhone accepted the bet.

Campuswide senator Wafa Ben 
Hassine presented “Discrimination 
in UCSD Press: A Threat to our 
University’s Integrity,” in which she 
showed derogatory images from the 
Koala that have sparked controversy 
in recent years. 

Hassine aims to form a committee 
that would work with Student Legal 
Services to research the legality of the 
publication of offensive material.

A Sun God Festival pre-party 
is slated for Wednesday of Week 
Seven, the week of the musical 
event. Campuswide senator Adam 
Kenworthy secured the ‘Atrium’ — 

an indoor food court area in Price 
Center East — for a afternoon of 
games like horseshoes and non-
alcoholic beer pong.

 True to his word, Advocate 
General Parminder Sandu, brought a 
resolution of impeachment for Pena, 
Biological Sciences senator John 
Erhart and Sixth College senator 
Kevin Nguyen to the table.

After one too 
many personal 
sob stories, coun-
cilmembers voted 
to not impeach 
the three sena-
tors.

The council 
next discussed the California Brown 
Act, which states that issues of new 
business may only be presented on 
the council floor if the council, by 
a two-thirds vote of members, or a 
unanimous vote of members present 
if the two-thirds number isn’t reached, 
calls for an item to be urgent and of 
immediate action.

AVP of Academic Affairs Jordan 
Taylor noted that two-thirds of vot-
ing members weren’t present at the 
council meeting, and feared that this 
act would eliminate new business 
completely.

The council passed a motion to 
table this item until its next meeting.

The Graduate Student 
Association rejected the newly 
written Loft referendum, whose 
language was passed by the A.S. 
Council last week.

President Utsav Gupta said that 
the council needed to reconsider the 
referendum’s language, but said he 
felt uncomfortable discussing it in 
new business since the language and 
fee amount had changed.

At the end of the night, council 
voted to discuss the Loft and trans-
portation referendums next week.

GLOWING BACTERIA: FUTURE WARNING SYSTEM
:*0,5*,�AND�;,*/5636.@

By Henry Becker
Staff Writer

UCSD professors caused a stir in the academic com-
munity with their discovery of blinking genetic cells of 
bacteria. The researchers discovered how to synchro-
nize colonies of cultured E. coli bacteria to give off a 
fluorescent light in unison. The procedure is meant to 
alter the bacteria’s frequencies to react to environmental 
changes. 

Associate professor of biology and bioengineering 
Jeff Hasty and associate director of UCSD’s BioCircuits 
Institute Lev Tsimring detailing their findings in the 
science journal Nature last Tuesday. 

The duo described how their discovery was built 
off their work from last year, when Hasty and Tsimring 
first induced a fluorescent flash in cultured E. coli 
cells by injecting them with a manufactured virus that 
changed their genetic makeup. 

Next, the scientists stimulated the cells using posi-
tive and negative feedback components to design a net-
work of synchronized bacteria.

The synchronization of these cells and their flashing 
has helped scientists understand more about the pat-
terns of communications between organisms. 

Hasty said that the fluorescent flashes, or oscilla-
tions, may possibly be used in health care. 

“We use these oscillations as a type of sensor,” he 
said. “When they are individual and out of sync, we just 
see noise — but together, they make a signal.”

According to Hasty, this fluorescent signal could be 
used as a biosensor that can distinguish patterns in an 
environment and react to them. For example, the bac-
teria could be used to indicate the frequency of drugs 
administered to a patient by sensing the time interval 
between doses. 

The research could also one day lead to genetic sen-
sors that would provide humans with early warning of 
potential environmental threats, such as temperature 
changes or poisons. 

Hasty and Tsimring emphasized that the research 
was highly theoretical and said that they will move on 
to testing neural connections in mammals and work on 

finding different ways to apply this discovery to practi-
cal pharmaceutical uses.

The project is an extension of the work done at 
UCSD’s new BioCircuits Institute, which opened in 
Urey Hall last July. The institute focuses on the study of 
cell networks such as neurons, and how they might be 
controlled. 

Tsimring said that learning how to control small 
portions of gene circuitry — such as the synchroniza-
tion of the E. coli cultures — allows researchers to 
understand more about how the cell bodies work as a 
whole.

The BioCircuits Institute studies the biological net-
works that regulate cell activity, such as fluoresent flash-
ing, and organisms’ responses to their environment. 

“We’re bringing together people in neural connectiv-
ity and biological connectivity, and showing that there 
is a mathematical similarity so they can share ideas,” 
Hasty said.

33%    Yes.

By principle of perpetual stu-dent brokeness, free food goes fast on any college cam-
pus. But much like drugs or alcohol, 
a complimentary slice of pizza is 
just as quickly consumed as its ori-
gin is forgotten. 

That’s why, when the Grove 
busted open its doors and fed 
2,200 hungry students at its grand 
reopening last week, it needed 
something more than a free teriyaki 
chicken sandwich to turn a line full 
of deal seekers into loyal, coffee-tot-
ing Groveheads. It needed branding 
and professionalism.

Not that serving up $6,000 
worth of free meals — funded by 
A.S. Council in an attempt to pull 
the struggling coffeehouse out of 
its $140,000 debt — was a poor 
attempt at forming a fan base. Had 
the effort been pulled off properly, 
it might have even charmed stu-
dents into visiting the Grove on a 
regular basis. But unfortunately, the 
execution of the Grove’s weeklong 
free-for-all — like its BBQ chicken 
pizzas — was half-baked. 

In business, first impressions 

make or break you. When there 
are no giant banners or balloons 
to remind students where they got 
their free food, they won’t remem-
ber. When coupons are printed 
on cheap printouts rather than 
glossy, colorful paper, they’ll be 
crumpled and forgotten in a book 
bag. When meals are served on 
flimsy paper plates and customers 
herded through a line like cattle, 
nothing will stop us from deeming 
the Grove a slow, out-of-the-way 
cafeteria.

True, part of the Grove’s unsuc-
cessful presentation lies fault to 
the business’s obscure location and 
maze-like setup, but we can’t help 
but wonder why a little bit more 
thought wasn’t put into the whole 
thing.

If it’s a matter of money — 
though it hardly is when A.S. 
Council is your personal sugar 
daddy — the Grove could’ve cut 
one day of free food to fund some 
snazzy decorations. Or it could have 
saved money by actually tracking 
who had already received a free 
meal (rather than allow hungry stu-

dents to come back for fourths). 
Even if employees didn’t have 

time to add some supplementary 
sparkle, they could have at least 
cleared the old equipment out of the 
indoor lounge and clearly labeled it 
as part of the cafe. We’re not asking 
for trendy Loft-like furnishing, just 
a clean, professional environment 
that gives customers some hint at 
what the Grove’s all about.

All complaints about aesthetics 
aside, it seems the Grove is strug-
gling with something much more 
basic: providing quick service and 
tasty meals. A week after the grand 
opening hubbub, a couple editorial 
board members returned to observe 
the coffeehouse in action. Some 
members were served quickly, but 
weren’t impressed with the food. 
Another waited a half-hour for their 
sandwich and witnessed a slew of 
order mistakes, one of which result-
ed in a frustrated costumer ask-
ing for his money back and leav-
ing with nothing. This all while 
a Grove employee was indulging 
in his own sandwich behind the 
counter.

If a staff of four can’t sort out a 
few sandwich orders, it seems this 
$6,000 grand reopening might have 
been premature, if not all for noth-
ing. 

It’s obvious Grove Student 
Manager Thomas Frank hasn’t 
thought out an efficient opera-
tions system to prepare for the foot 
traffic he hoped the Grove would 
gain. And if he can’t shape up on 
this front, it won’t be long until the 
Grove has pissed off enough people 
that it’s right back where it started.

It doesn’t matter how alternative 
a student-run business is; if a hun-
gry student has to wait 30 minutes 
for a mediocre sandwich during 
his lunch break, next time he’ll just 
go to Subway. There’s no doubt 
that will happen. The real question 
is: How much more will the A.S. 
Council shell out to save the Grove 
next time?

I am navigationally retarded. Street signs mean nothing to me. I have never success-
fully operated a compass. When 
confronted with a road map, it takes 
me roughly 45 minutes to figure 
out where I am, by which point 
I’m usually somewhere else. While 
driving home for winter break last 
month, I missed my freeway exit 
and ended up in Sacramento — a 
full 90 miles past my destination. 
Three weeks later, on my first night 
in Washington, DC, I went out in 
search of a 7-Eleven and nearly suc-
cumbed to hypothermia after some-
how ending up on the east bank of 
the Potomac River, halfway across 
town. 

I’m not dumb, I swear. I just hap-
pen to have been born with a sense 
of direction slightly worse than that 
of a senile chimpanzee.  It shames 
me to admit it, but without the aid 
of my cellphone’s built-in GPS func-
tion, I probably would have died on 
some dark city street a long time 
ago, my moonlit corpse surrounded 
by crumpled MapQuest printouts 
and an absurd number of taquito 
wrappers. 

Naturally, the phrase “Where am 
I?” occurs with great frequency in 
my daily vocabulary. Sometimes I 
ask strangers. Most of the time, I ask 
myself. When I’m really desperate I 
call my dad and ask him — a ques-
tion typically met by an elongated 
description of my latent idiocy, fol-
lowed by a brief set of instructions 
on how to get back to my apartment 
from the Starbucks around the cor-
ner. 

“Are you stupid, son?”
“No, Dad, I’m just navigationally 

retarded.”
After 22 years of this, I know a 

lot about being lost. I know what 
it’s like to wonder why they built 
a big fence around Los Angeles 
before realizing you’ve driven to the 
Mexican border. I know the feeling 
you get after wandering around the 
international terminal at SFO for 
half an hour only to learn that a trip 
to San Diego falls under the cat-
egory of “domestic flights.” I know 
how much it sucks to miss the first 
half of a movie because you spent 
40 minutes running back and forth 
between Sears and Sbarro in a des-
perate attempt to find the theatre, 
all the while being loudly ridiculed 
by a group of Hispanic teenag-
ers hanging out in front of Pacific 
Sunwear. 

I know what it’s like to be dis-
oriented, perplexed, hopelessly off 
course. If I was a bird, I’d be one of 
those birds that flies into a window. 
Had I been born to a 19th century 
American frontier family, I would 
have been disowned immediately 
after puberty because I wouldn’t be 
able to track bison worth shit. 

Though the ability to kill slow-
moving animals doesn’t hold the 
same kind of weight that it used 
to, all of this still makes me tre-
mendously nervous for the next six 
months of my life. You see, between 
now and June I have to figure out

It’s almost not worth it to keep talking about the recently pro-posed changes to the A.S. Media 
Guidelines, drafted last week by four 
absentminded councilmembers with a 
penchant to make yet another aspect 
of student life an administration-
tamed bore.

At the embarrassing public forum 
last Tuesday, a host of skeptical coun-
cilmembers and angry representatives 
from student publications turned up 

to mouth off about the 
restricting nature of the 
drafted guidelines.

Thing is, everyone 
who took a turn at the 
podium soon realized 
they were preaching to 
the choir. The guidelines 

sucked, and the only person who didn’t 
think so was one-man-army Associate 
Vice President Student Organizations 
Andrew Ang — the “brains” behind 
the new legislation, and supposed rep-
resentative of all student-org interests 
on campus (even though not a 
single one expressed inter-
est in receiving university 
sponsorship, as Ang pro-
posed).

Even his three accomplices in 
writing up the new rules deserted him 
on the battlefield. At a certain point, 
it was painful to watch. Campuswide 
Senator Adam Kenworthy admitted 
that the proposal to require content 
guidance by a faculty member — 
which comprised the entire first half 
of the draft — didn’t reflect student 
interests, and was kind of just lame in 
general. Revelle Senator Jaclyn Storey 
cowered the entire time, and man-
aged to escape without saying a word. 
Then there was Marshall Senator 
Brian McEuen — oh wait, no there 
wasn’t. Dude was so scared he didn’t 
even show up.

Makes you wonder how much 
time the committee spent in conver-
sation, when only a single member 
now stands by its final decisions. 
(And at this point, even Ang probably

OPINION� THURSDAY, JANUARY 28, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 5 

wants to take it all back. But he’s 
probably better off looking like a 
fascist administrator-loving asshole 
than admitting he did the whole 
thing to get rid of the Koala, and 
doesn’t actually care 
about the vast improve-
ment in “quality” that 
university oversight 
would allegedly have on 
student newspapers.)

In the end, there’s 
no denying the glar-
ing crappiness of 
much student media 
at UCSD. When 
spell-check is waived, 
graphics are credited 
to the “Internet” and 
Muslims are depicted 
as monkeys in diapers 
by right-wing publica-
tions with no history 
of irony, one certainly hopes the 
Communicatons majors in the pro-
duction room aren’t putting this on 
their resume.

But the mere fact that fellow stu-
dents — like, presumably halfway-
cool young people — would think it 
was a good idea to self-importantly 
make up more rules that would 
unleash an old person on the cre-
ative process, possibly affecting 
the hilarious effects (if only hilari-
ously bad) on the outcome, makes 
us wonder whether the council’s 
really a band of administrators in 
disguise.

Student newspapers are awe-
some because they don’t come out 
on time, their offices have more 
empty beer cans than computers 
and their editors mostly just want 
the title to improve their chances of 
getting laid. Since when did we not 
fight the man in solidarity? 

Even the second half of the pro-

posal, which lays out a new way of 
reviewing funds for student publi-
cations, contains obvious lapses in 
judgment. The current system — 
the Student Organization Funding 
Advisory Board (SOFAB) — already 

suffers from inefficiencies.
Instead of just com-

piling a list of standard 
printing and publication 
costs and referring to it 
when the organization in 
question happens to pro-
duce media, Ang and his 
committee proposed creat-
ing a whole new group of 
student politicians to com-
plicate an inherently ques-
tionable process. The new 
board would also include 
two representatives from 
student newspapers on 
campus, obviously allow-
ing for rivalries between 

publications to air themselves in the 
boardroom, and potentially affect 
funding.

A.S. President Utsav Gupta may 
have shelved the new media guide-
lines indefinitely at the council’s 
meeting last night, but the council 
can’t erase this. The A.S. Council 
reputation sank to its low of the 
year this week, thanks to the badly 
thought-out, fun-killing whims of 
an out-of-touch few. 

When dealing with the his-
toric UCSD free-speech issue and, 
particularly, the Koala, the AVP 
Student Organizations should know 
his every move has to be flawless. 
Instead, Ang’s media guideline 
changes blatantly proposed content 
regulation and biased funding, and 
made any future attempt to sneakily 
change the guidelines traceable to 
an initial bias against offensive con-
tent (read: the Koala making fun of 
dead people). Good one, guys.

how to be a grown-up. I have to fig-
ure out how to fend for myself, how 
to hold a job, how to shop at Home 
Depot and read bestselling novels 
and appear intriguing to women. 
I have to figure out how to drink 
cocktails and talk about car insur-
ance, how to buy drapes and invest 
in mutual funds and make food 
without a panini press.

According to my guidance 
counselor, my parents and a lot of 
other middle-aged people with back 
problems, I have to plot a course, 
choose a path, head toward some 
pre-determined goal. My propensity 
for wandering unknowingly in the 
wrong direction for extended peri-

ods of time surely isn’t going to help 
out a whole lot. It might even land 
me somewhere terrible, like prison, 
or drug rehab or middle manage-
ment. 

Fortunately I get the feeling that 
this is exactly the type of confu-
sion about 90 percent of my peers 
are suffering from at this very 
moment. We’re all about to set out 
on our own, to navigate haphazardly 
through this treacherous 21st-centu-
ry landscape. We’re rocking violently 
back and forth on the brink of total 
independence, painfully aware of our 
impending responsibilities but large-
ly unwilling to accept the horrifying 
prospect of full-blown adulthood. 

What’s worse, most of us aren’t 

really sure how to get there. After 
roughly two decades of homework, 
soccer practice, standardized tests, 
ready-made dinners and extensive 
amounts of hand holding, it’s going 
to be tough to find our bearings. 
Those of us not already committed 
to graduate school — the educa-
tional equivalent of breast feeding 
— will likely wander blindly into 
the void, our resumes pinned to our 
coats and a steady stream of snot 
flowing from our noses.

All I know is I’m going to keep 
my dad on speed dial. 

“What do you want, son?”
“Guidance, Dad. Oh and how 

far is Toronto from Irvine? Cause I 
think I missed my exit.”

this week, 
thanks to the

whims of an

By Rebecca Erbe 
Contributing Writer

In an era of filmmaking where any halfwit can deduce a movie’s entire plot from a single teaser trailer, it’s a refreshing to learn that “44 Inch 
Chest” is not at all it seems. Especially after its pre-
view, an “Ocean’s Eleven” master-plan prototype with 
a predictable sense of wit, made it out to be a token 
dark comedy. 

In fact, freshman director Malcolm Venville 
knows exactly what kind of film it is; he just won’t tell 
us right away. Ray Winstone (“The Departed”) shines 
as Colin, a man whose life is left in pieces after his 
wife informs him she’s leaving their 21-year marriage 
to run away with another man.

While he’s shocked with distraught, Colin’s friends 
whip out a surefire plan: kidnap his wife’s lover so 
Colin can exact his revenge. 

It’s up to his motley crew — Meredith (Ian 
McShane), the gay, smarmy swindler; Archie (Tom 
Wilkinson), who still lives with his mom; and Peanut 
(John Hurt), the homophobic old-timer — to do 
the deed. As a safety net for a cuckolded Colin, the 
trio gives him an outlet for his grief: a bottle or two 
of brandy and one fettered Frenchman. That’s what 
friends are for, right?

Winstone is the gem of the film. Though he wears 
the hard exterior of a man long burdened by brutish 
labor, he often collapses with heartwrenching grief, 
delivering lines like “Love is a garden, and you have 
to weed it to keep it beautiful” with cheeseless sincer-
ity. He earns our sympathy again and again, only to 

toss it aside as Colin’s dark 
inner turmoil rises to the 
surface, fearlessly warding 
us off with his black and 
deadened stare.

Venville keeps the 
film — a manifestation of 
Colin’s rolling emotions 
— from tipping into one 
stock genre or another. The 
main character is too dark 
to be comedic, his gang too 
cavalierly oddball for the 
serious crime genre and 

the setting too singular for an action flick. “Chest” is 
the definition of successful anti-formula — surpris-
ing us from fade in to fade out, never waxing forced 
or contrived. Just try to guess what happens next.

But it’s a more natural fit than one might 
think. According to Dubstep at UCSD 
founder and engineering grad student David 
Gross, the scene’s diehards are dirt-styled 
twentysomethings loitering on the introspec-
tive fringe of dance culture, shying from LED 
lasers, happy pills and the sweaty rave grind. 
UCSD introverts, rejoice: You can get out of 
your molding dorm rooms for a night and 
still be perfectly antisocial. Because it’s built 
on a woozy 2step rhythm, moving to dub is 
a noncontact sport with a hoodie/headphone 
uniform.  

Gross is optimistic that student interest in 
his cause will snowball until we’ve got our-
selves a mini dubstep scene on campus — to 
a degree that could rival the Che Cafe of 
yesteryear. And it does seem the base is there: 
On the same Saturday that Let’s Bounce — 
UCSD’s most popular deejay event — went 
down in the Price Center Ballrooms, dubstep 
“brainfeeder” Nosaj Thing managed to draw a 
faster and more committed crowd to the Loft 
next door. The kids apparently got so hyped 
that one pulled a fire alarm (either that or a 
fun-killing security guard wanted to flush the 
hordes from Price Center and do a recount — 
if you’re the conspiracy-theory type).

The venue’s coordinators, according to 
Gross, didn’t let Nosaj set up the woofers he 
needed for the maximum bass experience. 
And, as any true dubhead can tell you, the 
beat is nothing if not rattling the phlegm 
from your most neglected alveoli. 

“I’ve been to shows where you literally 
couldn’t breathe,” Gross said. “Dubstep is 

definitely not for people with pre-existing 
heart conditions.”

Now, thanks to the electronic Dome at 
Coachella, UCSD has a student org devoted to 
womping on the weekly. It was in the Dome, 
where they ran the beat run until 4 a.m., that 
Gross first discovered his love for the dubstep 
culture. He then spent the summer getting 
whirlwinded into the LA scene — rivaled only 
by that in England and New York, Gross said 
— hopping between word-of-mouth ware-
house shows and even systems set up in movie 
theaters. (In the seated environment, the show 
can be all about the visuals, he said. And, of 
course, the vibrations.)

By the end of last quarter, Gross and seven 
of his friends had materialized a plan to rec-
reate the dizzying LA dubstep vibe here at 
UCSD. But as soon as the thousands of fliers 
for their first show at Porter’s Pub went up in 
Price Center three weeks ago, Gross said the 
administration started asking questions, trying 
to “roadblock” the club by mandating expen-
sive university equipment and security guards.

“They charge like $800 for a fog machine 
and a bunch of lights,” Gross said.

The club relegated all questions to Stephen 
Lawler, owner of the Pub (who’s more used to 
getting university admin off his back), and set 
a determined tunnel vision on gathering dee-
jays and equipment for that night’s show.

“We were like pushing 200-pound speak-
ers across the school on dollies,” Gross said. 
“We didn’t even have a microphone until the 
very end.”

And they would rather work that way — 
descending upon the unsuspecting students 

in a bass explosion, creating a sort of flash 
audio-mob that can’t be traced nor prepared 
for. Frustrated with the time-consuming pro-
cess of applying for A.S. funds, the club has 
even bypassed that opportunity for a more 
spontaneous, you-find-a-needle, I’ll-get-
an-emcee approach. The sound system, for 
instance, is currently being borrowed from a 
guy named Juan from East County.

“He’s just some guy we met,” Gross said. 
“Some guy with a ton of speakers.”

The club’s motto is “Experience Audio 
Thunder.” Unfortunately, chill as the Pub may 
be, its rickety plywood frame is no match for 
that kind of loud. At last Tuesday’s Dub at the 
Pub show — sadly underattended due to the 
rain (though I guess that only makes it more 
underground) — every nail in the place was 
all but buzzing out of its socket, absorbing all 
that good, warm worminess before it could 
find its way into our chest cavities.

That’s why Gross is hoping Mike Gao, a 
graduate student in the music department 
equally committed to the dubstep cause (he 
does the visuals and helps recruit guests for 
the Dub at the Pub shows), could one day 
convince the UCSD academics to give the 
stuff a listen. Just imagine, Gross said, all that 
perfect rhythm allowed to ruminate in a prac-
tice room at the Conrad Prebys Music Center.

Before the scientists realize its power and 
it flies the underground forever, get in on this 
shit. It’s happening this instant, and if you’re 
not here, you’ll miss it. So find your way to 
the Pub next Tuesday evening — there’s eight 
dirt-styled twentysomethings there who want 
to show you the dub.

‘LETHAL’ COMEBACK
High-Octane Gibson Pardons DUI With Hospital-Gurney Showdown
By Matthew Pecot
Associate Hiatus Editor

A fter 20 years of DUIs, anti-Semitic rants and novels worth of Mayan subtitles, Mel Gibson has finally given us what we 
really wanted: “Lethal Weapon 5.”

Except it’s called “Edge of Darkness,” 
and it’s based on a BBC miniseries. But the 
setup’s so similar to work by sequel-happy 
“Weapon” director Richard Donner that 
you could recycle his trailers. Cue creature-
from-the-deep announcer guy: “Mel Gibson 
just lost his family. He’s a cop on the edge. 
And he’ll break every rule in the book in the 
name of justice.” 

And because we’re a hopelessly nostalgic 
society, more of the same is exactly what we 
crave.

By the 10-minute mark, Emma Craven 
(Bojana Novakovic) has been gunned down 
— but everyone thinks the bullet was meant 
for her father, Thomas Craven (Gibson). 
However, she started puking up blood before 
getting shot. What gives?

So Thomas starts kicking down doors to 
figure out why someone killed his daughter. 
An old CIA operative who’s tired of cover-

ups (Ray Winstone) points him in the right 
direction, and the two rack up an impressive 
body count along the way. But before we get 
to the action, Thomas spends about 15 min-
utes grieving — too bad Mad Max can’t cry. 
It never reaches George Lucas levels of inept 
sentimentality, but Gibson’s no better at 
doing sad than Keanu Reeves. We didn’t pay 
10 bucks for a crying Australian; if you’d 
wanted that, we’d have reminded Hugh 
Jackman that he starred in “X-Men Origins: 
Wolverine.” 

“Edge” is an action thriller, with fast and 
dirty fight scenes as 
viciously sharp as 
Gibson’s mullet days 
(think “Bourne” with-
out the Handycam). 
Get ready for knife 
fights, shootouts, and 
even a few holy-shit 
moments. They might 
be completely irrel-
evant to the plot, but 
what are we here for if not an adrenaline 
rush, anyway?

Don’t tell Gibson that. He’s collaborated 
with director Martin Campbell and producer 

Michael Wearing to make what he thinks is 
a politically charged thriller that draws on 
fears of a reactionary-right takeover and the 
environmentalist Gaia hypothesis.

This may have come across in the six-hour 
BBC miniseries, but if Gibson’s track record is 
any indication, an exact replication would have 
bred a pretentious monster of a film. 

Luckily, we’re spared any Steven Segal 
moral-of-the-story monologues, and the 
script’s dry wit keeps the film snappy 
when the tension eases up. The only prob-
lem is that most characters are Bostonian 

— accents included.
Seamless cinematogra-
phy is definitely the film’s 
high point, but we only 
notice when our eyes can 
no longer stand the sight 
of Gibson attempting to 
appear mournful.

“Darkness” certainly 
isn’t a spectacular film — 
the detective-thriller bits 

are riddled with plot holes — but at the end 
of the day, it’s fun. And it feels damn good 
to toss all judgments aside and thoroughly 
enjoy a Mel Gibson film again.  

Charlotte Gainsbourg
IRM
ELEKTRA

H er face and name may be packaged right in with her whis-
pery, evocative vocals, 
but for some reason I’m 
not convinced that IRM 
is Charlotte Gainsbourg’s 
album. Does the album’s 
creative credit belong to 
this beautiful chanteuse, or 
to Beck — the American 
alt-legend who actually 
produced and wrote the 
entire album? 

It’s hard to believe 
the former, as Beck’s Sea 
Change wail permeates 
nearly every track. From 
the orchestration of “Le 
Chat Du Café Des Artistes” 
to the rumbling “Trick 
Pony,” most instrumenta-
tion sounds right off Beck’s 
Modern Guilt.

It’s almost as if 
Gainsbourg is simply play-
ing the part of a singer in a 
film. The acclaimed actress, 
who most recently starred in 
the disturbing “Antichrist,” 
does pull off a memorable 

performance on the album, 
but Charlotte isn’t trying 
to win an Oscar here; she’s 
supposedly crafting intel-
ligent pop.

Instead, she leaves that 
job to a more talented man 
and contents herself with 
the responsibility of the 
muse — something she no 
doubt picked up from her 
own parents, Jane Birkin 
and infamous French pedo-
phile Serge Gainsbourg. 

Though allusions to such 
legendary collaborations 
like her parents are evident 
— especially in “Heaven 
Can Wait”, the playful duet 
between her and Beck — 
Gainsbourg can’t seem to 
find a sound that’s distinctly 
her own. As a result, IRM 
is essentially a Beck album 
with female vocals.

But hell, it just might 
be the best Beck album in 
years — and it’s certainly 
Gainsbourg’s best yet.

Strong Arm Steady
In Search of Stoney Jackson
BLACKSMITH

C alifornia natives Strong Arm Steady combine with Stones Throw prophet 
Madlib for In Search of Stoney 
Jackson. With a super-alliance 
between World Famous Beat 
Junkie J Rocc, emcee heavy-
weights Talib Kweli, Phonte 
and a host of no-names, 
Jackson shapes up to be a killer 
Cali classic in the press release 
— but the final product is a 
slightly different story. 

SAS rappers Krondon, 

Phil da Agony and Mitchy 
Slick were handed a platter of 
J Rocc’s 200 finest recipes for 
their soundtrack, with Madlib 
in the producer’s seat, and 
everything starts out promis-
ing. “Best of Times” lays down 
a chunky bass-guitar groove 
atop a one-two snare ‘n’ bass 
beat — all wrung together with 
a high-to-low synth progres-
sion. The syrupy melody is 
complemented by Phonte’s 
expertise: “Got workers losing 
they jobs and they residence/ 
And overseas niggaz filin’ out, 
straight wildin’ out/ Throwin’ 
they shoes at the President.” 

“Cheeba Cheeba” starts 
with finger snaps over dull bass 

and distorted Motown violin, 
and Krondon whimsically 
attempts to forecast another 
Acid Raindrops: “All my niggaz 
smoke Swishers/ Like old men 
playing Checkers on a park 
bench like Bobby Fisher.” Yeah, 
that’s exactly what it feels like. 

Madlib pays service to Dilla 
on “Chittlins & Pepsi,” a feel-
good funk romp painted with 
trumpet, chopped violin and a 
breezy harmonized chorus — 
something that would fit right 
in on Donuts. This golden-age 
inspiration continues into “Get 
Started,” a head-bumping gem 
of a jam, reminiscent of Jazzy 
Jeff ’s “Summertime.” Piano 
and hi-hat rush through high-

speed clashes as Talib Kweli 
shines over his West Coast 
counterparts: “We takin’ over 
back to work like my break is 
over/ Next up Steady Arms and 
Hammers like baking soda.” 

“True Champs” is an old-
school triumph — a rousing, 
orchestral sample cut into 
pieces across a timeless stac-
cato loop. But it’s butchered 
by Krondon’s rhyme schemes: 
“When opportunity knocks I 
invite him in/ My flow is hard 
to swallow like a vitamin.” 
Stoney Jackson’s mediocrity can 
be summed up in “Bark Like a 
Dog,” a bass drum-heavy head-
ache topped off by an appall-
ing chorus and chaotic guitar 
sample.

There are lots of nice rea-
sons to like Jackson, but that’s 
its problem: It never supersedes 
that. Beats loosen necks, but 
never break them, and guest 
emcees prove more listenable 
than the SAS crew itself. It 
should be judged as an ensem-
ble piece, even if it is no greater 
than the sum of its parts.

Mr Hudson
Straight No Chaser
GOOD MUSIC

W e all know a Mr Hudson: He’s that dorky high-school kid 
who always manages to slip 
the F-bomb into songs just to 
show us how cool he is. 

It doesnt work. In fact, 
Straight No Chaser’s melan-
cholic lyrics make him seem 
more like a wimpy emo kid. 

Not to write him off 
completely. This skinny Brit 
may have just dropped the 
first emo hip-hop album, and 
it’s not half bad. Straight No 
Chaser is an eclectic mix of 
beats and genres: He mixes 
synth-heavy hooks with that 
classic hip-hop beat. He sings 
on some tracks, raps on oth-
ers and is sensitive on every 
one.

You won’t find songs about 
nasty-ass bitches and hoes in 
No Chaser. Instead, you’ll be 
dragged into Hudson’s world 
of commercial heartache, each 
song artificially sad like the 
careful placement of every 
hole on those “grungy” jeans 
that cost you $300.

On first single 
“Supernova,” Hudson wails 
about being a lonely bloke 
who’s bummed that everyone 
“got all the things I thought 
I wanted.” He continues with 
“White Lies,” berating himself 
for self-deception, and even 

the title track — ostensibly 
an anthem to how well a cool 
guy can hold his liquor — 
turns out to be about drinking 
alone to drown the pain. 

The constant pity party is 
wearing, but it’s got a finesse 
that gets us moving nonethe-
less. Hudson may have the 
weepiest lyrics in the game, 
but add some sticky beats, 
plaintive vocals and icy 
synths, and you’ve got genre-
defying innovation.

 “Supernova” drones us 
with insistent bass, thudding 
drums and buzzing electron-
ics to turn breakup lament 
into a midtempo dance gem.

“White Lies” brings us 
pop a la Mika. Here, Hudson’s 
high-pitched rendition of 
“lie-e-ai-e-ai” is imposed over 
complex instrumentation and 
sprinkled with tinkling piano 
and whispery vocals to build a 
grand chorus.

Bottom line: Straight No 
Chaser’s powerful sonic illu-
sion helps us forget Hudson 
never stops whining about 
this or that. His repetitive 
beats and alarm-clock beeps 
even mesmerize us enough 
to believe — for a very brief 
moment — that he really is 
the baddest boy on the block.

Beach House 
Teen Dream
SUB POP

I t’s high time Baltimore twosome Beach House earned some props for 
their lilting dream pop, and 
Teen Dream feels like their 
breakout LP. While Victoria 
Legrand and Alex Scally’s 
self-titled debut and 2008 
followup Devotion rode a 
dependably mellow niche 
of murmuring melodies 
and quiet keys, their third 
album (and first with Sub 
Pop) is a switch like when 
TV went Technicolor. 

Their first records’ ever-
present coyness and mys-
tique is traded in for ambi-
tion and overt balladry this 
time around, starting right 
away with the harmonizing 
“Zebra.” The track slowly 
gains momentum with 
plaintive finger-picked 
guitar, layering synths as 
Legrand’s smoky declara-
tions ground the Baroque 
anthem. “Any way you run, 
you run before us/ Black 
and white horse, arching 
among us,” she croons, 
pulling each syllable from 
her lips like embedded 
thorns. 

Then the duo shifts into 
“Silver Soul,” Beach House’s 
first late-night cruising cut 
with an accentuated, pop-
heavy beat just begging to 

be remixed. This near-per-
fect first half of the album 
continues with the angelic 
shoegaze of “Norway,” the 
staccato choir coos and a 
slide guitar jangles, reach-
ing a bliss that could infect 
at gigantic festivals and 
intimate halls. 

The rest of Teen Dream 
blurs just like the opening 
trifecta, a series of singles 
that, at times, evokes 
Stereolab’s electro-lounge, 
Sally Shapiro’s minimal 
disco and oddly jaunty 
source material in the pre-
viously released cut, “Used 
to Be.” 

That track’s cheesy 
bounce and theatric indul-
gence is definitely the 
LP’s low point — but then 
“Lover of Mine” regains 
its refined tastes in a 
Feist-like, nearly R&B jam 
with reverb and smooth 
beats galore.Beach House’s 
boy and girl, like friends 
Grizzly Bear, have honed 
absurdly tasteful indie 
styles to absolute effect, 
and while the results may 
not be musically ground-
breaking, Teen Dream is 
too love-drunk on its own 
beauty to care.

The Magnetic Fields
Realism
NONESUCH

W ith the release of their tenth album, the Magnetic Fields dig up synth-pop 
roots to embrace a more earthy 
theme. Unfortunately, their new 
hokey folk lacks the tradition to 
ring true.

Mostly acoustic, the album 
is a thoughtful hodgepodge 
of various types of country, 
filled with vocalist Stephen 
Meritt’s semi-witty musings. 
Tracks like “We Are Having A 
Hootenanny” make us wonder 
whether the album was record-
ed on the set of “Oklahoma!”, 
while the melodic, plucked-key 
“The Dolls’ Tea Party” reminds 
us of our favorite (or most-
hated) nursery rhyme. 

The collection of slow 
mountain ballads starts out 
promising, reminiscent of Paul 

Simon and Conor Oberst, but 
slowly veer sinto an attempt at 
intellectual complication — one 
that’s just plain nonsensical 
on “You Must Be Out of Your 
Mind.” (“I want you crawl-
ing back to me down on your 
knees, yeah/ Like an appendec-
tomy sans anesthesia.”)

High points are whenever 
twangy country instruments 
— including specimen like the 
banjo, accordion and autoharp 
— make an appearance on the 
track. Our ears perk at Beach 
Boy throwback “The Dada 
Polka,” one of the record’s few 
playfully upbeat numbers. But 
the dapper beach ballad goes 
sour next to the Fields’ overam-
bitious hillbilly experiment.

dollar deficit, Ahmed said. “So they are 
looking at other ways of financing these 
programs. And because we don’t have the 
money to finance all these different tracks 
and programs, there is a need to cut in 
some places. This may be the best way to 
do it.” 

Elman said that the budget cuts will 
most likely negatively impact the faculty-
to-student ratio in social science courses.

“The current budget crisis is clearly 
a problem and has consequences for 
structure because we’re going to have 
fewer faculty teaching the same or more 
students,” Elman said.

He said that simplifying major 
requirements gives faculty more flexibility 
by eliminating a certain track’s course 
requirement, allowing them to teach a 
wider variety of subjects.

For instance, instead of being obligated 
to teach a series of classes for the 
anthropology track, a faculty member can 
branch out, and choose from a variety of 
subjects.

“If something new happens, you can 
teach a course and students can take that 
course,” Elman said. “I think it allows for 
more innovation.”

Though the cuts would affect faculty-
to-student ratios, Elman said that the 
proposal would also have some positive 
effects students in the social sciences. 

“One of the consequences of having 60 
required units is it really constrains what 
the students can do,” he said. “It locks them 
in. Now, if you have lots and lots of faculty 
and can guarantee you are teaching all 
these courses all the time, it may not be so 
bad.”

However, Ahmed said that decreasing 
the number of course tracks would provide 
less choices for students. 

“The beauty of college in itself is being 
able to have options, and being able to have 
options means not having to take certain 
classes you really don’t enjoy,” Ahmed said. 
“And because you are forced to only take 
certain tracks and these are your only options, 
obviously you don’t have as much diversity.”

Under this proposal, a task force of 
department chairs and administrators 
would decide specific changes within 
the various social science departments. 
Possible departments that will be 
affected, other than political science and 
international studies, include cognitive 
science, anthropology, psychology, 
sociology, linguistics, ethnic studies and 
urban planning.

Ahmed announced the proposal to 
A.S. Council because he would students 
to be represented in the decision-making 
process.

“We want to make sure our voices are 
heard while these issues are being made, 
because many times they are not made in 
the presence of us,” Ahmed said.

Lauren Lagano, a Muir College 
sophomore and international studies 
major, is currently studying anthropology 
and sociology, two of the seven specialized 
tracks in the international studies program. 
She said the proposal to reduce the tracks is 
restrictive to students.  

“I think it’s limiting what I can do well 
here at UCSD,” Lagano said. “If politics and 
economics were the only two tracks you 
could pick, I definitely wouldn’t be that 
major. I don’t do well in econ, and I really 
don’t like politics, so I’m looking for more 
of the anthro and socio-cultural aspects of 
it because that’s what I enjoy.” 

Changing major requirements is a 
bureaucratic process that can take up to two 
years. It usually takes six to nine months for 
faculty within a department to review their 
curriculum and discuss changes before 
forming a proposal, according to Elman. 
The Committee on Educational  Policy 
— a group affiliated with A.S. Council — 
takes an additional three to five months to 
review the proposal.

Elman said that if the major tracks are 
consolidated, current students studying 
these tracks will still be able to complete 
their major and the changes would only 
affect new students.

"9 out of 10 UCSD 
females are more 

excited by Regents 
Pizza than their 

boyfriends" 
-Lynn Becker

Honors thesis 2009.

For their following match on Friday 
night, the Tritons traveled to Galen 
Center in Los Angeles, home to No. 
1 University of Southern California. 
Unfortunately for the Tritons, they 
were defeated 30-24, 30-24, 30-21 in 
three straight sets,. Fritsch led the way 
with 16 kills, six digs and three blocks. 
Ross contributed five kills on .308 hit-
ting and four blocks. USC hit at .349, 
while UCSD hit at .190.

The Trojans also bettered the 
Tritons in digs, with 40 to UCSD’s 28.

USC started the first set with a 
quick 4-0 lead that UCSD was unable 
to close, resulting in USC’s 30-24 first-
set win. The Trojans hit at .333 in the 
initial set, while the Tritons hit at .195. 
In the second set, the Tritons led 14-11 
before their opponents fought back, 
scoring five consecutive points and 
then rounding out the set with seven 
of the last nine points.

In the final set, USC picked up an 
early 3-0 lead and ended the set 30-21, 
while hitting .417. Junior outside hit-
ter Joel Davidson added six kills and 
Spangler five for UCSD.

“USC is a very good serving team 
with a variety of serves, so that really 
got us out of sync,” Ring said.

The Tritons returned to action 
with a win in their first home game 
of the season against Princeton on 
Wednesday, Jan. 27 at RIMAC Arena.

The Saints enter the Super Bowl 
with all these intangibles on their 
side. The story seems as if it’s writ-
ten: This game — the last chapter 
in a 2009 season — will be titled 
something catchy like “When the 
Saints Came Marching in” or “All 
Saints’ Day” by the witty NFL Films 
narrators.

Maybe a storyline backed by 
chance and karma doesn’t seem to 
measure up to things like a superior 
defense or a more confident quar-
terback on the field — upper hands 
with which the Colts will enter 
Super Bowl XLIV on Feb. 7. 

Sometimes chemistry mat-
ters, as was showcased when the 
New England Patriots pulled off 
their now-famed Super Bowl upset 
against the more polished and 
potent St. Louis Rams. Sometimes 
it’s about a transcendent leader who 
rallies everyone around him — as 
was the case when John Elway led 

the Broncos to a win in Super Bowl 
XXXII. Other times, the game sim-
ply goes to the better team. That’s 
what happened when the Patriots 
won their last two championships, 

and when Elway 
and Co. won 
their second of 
two titles against 
the Falcons.

In terms 
of on-field 
performance, 
Indianapolis 
might not have 
scored as many 
points as the 
Saints, but the 
team has shown 
the ability to 
adjust quickly 

mid game. On special teams, the 
Colts don’t have an explosive return 
man like Reggie Bush, but have 
a steadier kicker in Matt Stover. 
Neither team has a great defense, 

but the Colts have more of a defen-
sive identity than the Saints, who 
need to improve in this department 
if they are serious about  winning 
the big game. 

With what has been shown dur-
ing the season and playoffs so far, 
the Colts should win. That’s why 
they’re favored. But the Saints have 
something fantastically intangible in 
their favor. Their storyline is in need 
of a climax to play respect to the 
events that have taken them this far. 
Football doesn’t matter as much as 
the city of New Orleans itself, but it 
helps people take their minds off of 
more sobering realities. Sometimes 
everyone needs a distraction from 
the bigger picture.

Predictions are usually wrong. 
But if you’re going to put yourself 
out there, no matter how much you 
think it through, you always got to 
go with that intangible something 
— the gut.

My Prediction: Saints 34, Colts 30.

mately lost 8-11, the Tritons finished 
the match on a high, with four goals 
in the fourth quarter.

Co-captain Stephanie Heinrich 
said she felt the game against San 
Diego State was a learning experi-
ence for the team before heading into 
the match against Michigan.

“We came out and showed off 
what we worked on,” Heinrich 
said. “We saw where we made mis-
takes and how to fix them against 
Michigan.”

The next day, UCSD fell 6-15 
sixth-ranked San Jose State 
University. The Spartans took a com-
manding lead of 7-1 by the first quar-

ter. The Tritons could only muster six 
goals: three from Heinrich, one from 
senior attacker Audra Bloom, one 
from senior utility player Stephanie 
Bocian and the last from freshman 
attacker Kim McComas. 

In the final game against No. 3 
UCLA, the Tritons competed even-
ly  with the Bruins early on. UCSD 
took a 2-1 lead in the first quarter 
and trailed by only one at halftime. 
However, the Bruins took a firm 
command in the second half of the 
game, ultimately emerging with a 
10-4 victory. 

Despite the loss to UCLA, 
Kreutzkamp felt the performance 
was his team’s best of the tourna-

ment, because players were able to 
familiarize themselves with their 
contributing roles on the team and 
gain confidence as a group. 

“Playing against such competitive 
teams, the team responded remark-
ably well,” Kreutzkamp said. “We just 
need to continue doing our best and 
continue to set the right tone to reach 
the championships.”

The Tritons return to action at the 
two-day Triton Invitational tourna-
ment, where they will host a field of 
16 teams at the Canyonview Aquatic 
Center from Feb. 6 to Feb. 7.

TRITONS RIDE WAVES IN MALIBU
MEN’S VOLLEYBALL — On Jan. 20, the 12th-
ranked UCSD men’s volleyball team pulled 
off a historic feat: The Tritons defeated No. 7 
Pepperdine University 33-31, 30-28, 23-30, 30-25 
at Firestone Fieldhouse.

This victory was the team’s first over national 
powerhouse Pepperdine, after 37 matches in over 
21 years. However, on Jan. 22, the Tritons lost 
momentum in over three sets against No. 1 
University of Southern California. Their overall 
record now stands at 2-5, 1-3 in the Mountain 
Pacific Sports Federation.

In the first set against Pepperdine, the Tritons 
scored the first three points. Their largest lead 
came at 24-20; however, Pepperdine fought back 
with a late push to lead 27-26.

The Waves took two chances at set point, but 
both were met with a UCSD point. The Tritons 
also had two set point opportunities, and man-
aged to convert the second attempt.

Junior outside hitter Will Ehrman’s seventh 
kill in the first set gave UCSD a 32-31 lead, before 
junior setter Phil Bannan’s kill sealed the team’s 

33-31 win.
The second set consisted of a seesaw battle for 

the lead. After the last tie at 14-14, senior opposite 
hitter Frank Fritsch pushed UCSD to a 15-14 lead. 
Fritsch’s 11th kill of the match and a Pepperdine 
error extended UCSD’s lead to 28-24. The oppo-
nents came close to completing a comeback, 
drawing within a point at 29-28 — but Ehrman 
sealed the set with his ninth kill of the match for 
a 30-28 victory.

In the third set, the Waves took an early 4-1 
lead, forcing the Tritons to call an early timeout. 
UCSD recovered to come within two points, at 
13-15, thanks to blocks by Ehrman and fresh-
man middle blocker Cyrus Kiani, but Pepperdine 
pushed to extend its lead to 18-13 and ultimately 
sealed the set 30-23.

The Tritons started off the fourth set with a 
10-5 lead, prompting the Waves to call an early 
timeout. UCSD then extended its lead to 16-11 
from a Fritsch kill and a solo block by junior 
middle blocker Adrian Gunthals.

Pepperdine fought back hard, making a come-

back to squeeze UCSD’s lead to two points at 
17-15. It was the Tritons turn to call a timeout.

The Waves cut the Tritons’ lead to a single 
point on multiple occasions throughout the rest 
of the match, but the Tritons earned consecutive 
points with a Bannan kill and block by junior 
middle blocker Calvin Ross, carrying their lead 
to 27-24.

Punctuated by Ehrman’s 13th kill in the match, 
UCSD went on to score the final three points of 
the game, ending the set 30-25.

“Overall, we felt that we could run our offense,” 
head coach Kevin Ring said. “We sided-out well 
and multiple times, which was key. We did a nice 
job blocking in the match.”

Fritsch and Spangler finished the match with 
20 and 19 kills, respectively. Ross added eight 
kills without an error, along with a team-high 
six blocks, and had a .667 hitting percentage. 
Bannan ended the night with 61 assists, six digs 
and four kills.

By Jessy Jahangir� Staff writer

In postseason football, games go one of two ways. When two teams make the postseason, 
either the favorite team wins, or 
some crazy fluke lifts the underdog 
in ways that make Vegas bookies 
cry, and Rudy smile. It could be a 
turnover or a coaching error (as is 
usually the case when Norv Turner 
is involved), but sometimes, it’s 
something more. The kind of myste-
rious upset that puts ESPN analysts 
to shame, and cannot be defined in 
a rulebook.

These are the forces that don’t 
show up in box scores and don’t earn 
points in fantasy leagues: leadership 
or chemistry, luck or destiny. The 
New Orleans Saints didn’t men-
tion luck or destiny after their NFC 
Conference Championship. It was 
something everyone tip-toed around 
like a bimbo’s obvious new boob job: 
they pretended it never even hap-
pened.

When the Indianapolis Colts 
handled the New York Jets in the 
AFC Championship game, people 
credited their methodical comeback 
from 11 down. When the Saints won, 
people talked about how random 
aberrations kept giving them a fight-
ing chance. Not too different from 
the mysterious forces that brought 
the Saints back to New Orleans 
after Hurricane Katrina forced them 
to make a temporary home in San 
Antonio. These same forces con-
spired to get Drew Brees in a Saints 
uniform, after he was close to sign-
ing for Miami. 

During the game, New Orleans 
kept being gifted the ball. Sometimes 
the Saints made a great play on the 
ball, like forcing the fumble from 
Bernard Berrian. Sometimes it was 
something more inconceivable, like 
when Favre and Peterson couldn’t 
make a handoff near the end of the 
second quarter, and the Vikings lost 
the chance at a halftime lead.

WOMEN’S WATER POLO — UCSD traveled to 
Ann Arbor, Mich., to open competitive play in the 
2009-10 water polo season against a series of top-
10 nationally ranked, Division-I opponents at the 
two-day Michigan Invitational tournament, from 
Jan. 23 to Jan. 24.

Taking on four top programs in two days 
proved a difficult task for the Tritons: They lost 
their first four games of the season.

Heading into the tournament, the Tritons 
retained senior goalkeeper Markayla Quane, 
sophomore attacker Jessica Tran and senior utility 
players Stephanie Heinrich and Stephanie Bocian 
from last year’s team — all of whom were recently 
recognized as pre-season All-Americans by the 
Association of Collegiate Water Polo Coaches.

According to head coach Brad Kreutzkamp, 
the meet provided the players a chance to see 

where they stood as a team, and to spot weak-
nesses early on.

“The tournament gives a really good indica-
tion to where we need to strive toward because of 
the good level of competition,” Kreutzkamp said.

In their first match of the tournament against 
No. 7 San Diego State University, the Tritons lost 
8-19. UCSD fell behind early on while the Aztecs 
scored five goals, closing out the first quarter 
with a 5-1 lead. In the fourth quarter, the Tritons 
scored three times, but a 12-save effort from 
Quane was futile — San Diego State piled on five 
more goals to seal the win.

Tallying points for UCSD was sophomore 
two-meter Kirsten Bates with three goals and 
junior attacker Hanalei Crowell with two.

The Tritons returned to action against 
No. 10 University of Michigan later that day. 
Their defense showed improvement against the 
Wolverines, conceding eight goals fewer than 
against SDSU. On offense, Heinrich scored two 
goals at the two-meter point, and attacker Tran 
scored from five meters away. Although they ulti-
