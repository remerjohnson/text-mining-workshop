Student Organization Forms 
to Back Carter Candidacy 

The first campGs organization backing a major presidential candidate 
has been approved by Student Center Director Mark Bookman. 

The group is UCSD Students to Elect Jimmy Carter President. 
Carter, the former governor of Georgia, is considered the Democratic 

frontrunner by many. 
According to political science student Joe Gallagher, who formed the 

group along with coordinator Larry Duke, Students for Carter will have a 
table set up on Revelle plaza today at noon to register students and 
distribute Carter literature. 

In addition, Gallagher is trying to qualify as a Carter delegate to the 
Democratic National Convention in New York in July. He will hold a 
caucus at 1 pm Sunday at the Julian Town Hall. 

Gallagher said 100 people from the 43rd Congressional District will 
have to support his candidacy before he can qualify. UCSD is in the 43rd 
district. 

Transportation to the caucus will be available ; those interested are 
asked to leave their names at the Carter table. 

Julian can be reached on Highway 78 east from Oceanside, or Highway 
79 north from Interstate eight, east of Alpine. 

Lunch will be served after the caucus. 
The Carter group is the first to specifically back a major Democratic or 

Republican candidate for President, though the Young Californians for 
F reedom have endorsed Ronald Reagan for the GOP nomination. 

Also, a group has organized to support Tom Hayden as the Democratic 
candidate for John Tunney's US Senate seat. 

Defense Witnesses Testify No 
Obstruction ; Marcuse Appears 

"Officials Never Declared Assembly Unlawful" 
by Mark Stadler 

News EdItor 
Hearing officer Robert 

Lugannani heard Wednesday and 
yesterday eight defense witnesses 
testify 10 charged students did not 
violate University regulations at 
the Nov. 25 demonstration over 
alleged UC ties with the CIA. 

The witnesses, who included 
charged student Cookie Mahoney 
and Ruth Quirk and philosophy 
professor emeritus Herbert 
Marc use , testified in disciplinary 
hearings about the walk from the 
gymnasium to Matthews campus 
taken by UC President Saxon 
following a question and answer 
session with students at the gym 
steps. 

The witnesses gave similar 
testimony: that students who 
accompanied Saxon on his walk did 
not disregard orders from a 
university official, obstruct an 
official's progress or endanger an 
official's health and safety. 

Didn't Hear Orders 
Four of the witnesses - Quirk, 

Mahoney, physics graduate 
student Dan Rosen and literature 
grad student "Robinson Herrarra -
said they never heard an ad-
ministrator declare the assembly 
unlawful, order students to 
disperse or ask students to not 
follow Saxon. 

Witnesses also asserted that 
Saxon's health and safety were 
never threatened, and that no one 
made remarks that threatened the 
President's well-being. 

Saxon himself testified earlier 
that he did not feel threatened 
during the demonstration. 

Saxon was never obstructed by 
students, according to the wit-
nesses. 

Rosen said that at no time did he 
see anyone try to block Saxon's 
passage, while Mahoney said she 
never heard any students indicate 
any intent to slow. down the 
President. 

Several witnesses did tell of 
seeing groups of demonstrators 
linking arms around Saxon, but 

said the link-ups did not stop 
Saxon. Mahoney said the link-ups 
moved backwards, away from 
Saxon. She said the individuals 
tried to maintain a steady distance 
from him at all times. 

Quirk testified she never linked 
arms during the walk, directly 

contradicting earlier testimony 
from Muir Dean Jim Beckley that 
she had done so on two separate 
occasions. 

All the witnesses except Mar-
cuse, who was present only at the 
question and answer period, said

Halberstam Labels President "Anchorman" of National Communications 
by James G. Solo 

City Editor 
"Information is power aOd the 

Presidency has more information 
available than any other in-
stitution," said Pt.ilitzer Prize 
winner David Halberstam 
Tuesday night. 

Halberstam, appearing as 
Mandeville lecturer, spoke at UC 
San Diego before 400 people in the 
Mandeville auditorium. 

Best known as the author of 
"The Best and The Brightest," 
Halberstam referred often tQ the 
subject of that book-Vietnam-
for examples to support his 
contention that the Presidency 
has become extremely powerful. 
He said the President can 
command in: ant and vast in-
fannatio.l access becau of the 
reYola tioa 

He hu also been able to co-opt 
the powers of other institUtions, 
notably Congress, Haberstam 
aid. 
Only the president has the 

capability to call for network air 
time upon demand. Halberstam 
said that this often leads to the 
abuse of network privileges. 

In 1964, according to HaUler-
starn, Lyndon Johnson was "the 
anchorman for the three network 
news shows as he was able to 
produce the information' he 

, wanted during the Tonkin Gulf 
crisis upon demand." 

Halberstam also pointed to 
Nixon using network news time to 
publically claim that he was 
innocent during the Watergate 

-affair as another abuse of 
presidential prerogative. 

Proxy Opposition 
The only other beneficiary of 

the tec,hnologlcal revolution - the 
network media - "are the only 
group that can bring coun-
tervailing power" against the 
executive, said Halberstam. 

He said that CBS newsman Dan 
Rather was In effect the proxy 
opposition to the president. 
During the press conferences on

Watergate, Rather was the only 
man between Nixon and the 
American people. 

According to Halberstam, the 
media-which he defines largely 
as the three networks and the 
diminishing print press-decides 
what is news. 

However, since the President 
can get on whenever he wants 
and the Congress hardly ever 
gets on, the Jeffersonian concept 
of democracy and separation of 
powers has become less 
meaningful. 

He said we live in polarized 
political society. There is the 
state-defined as the presidency-
and the anti-state-which is the 
press and, sometimes in tandem 
with it the Congress. 

However, Halberstam said th 
present s stem works to the 
advantage of the President 
because he can make decisions 
affecting every aspect of 
American life. In contra 1, said 
Halberstam, li th (network) 

evening news program is good as 
a front page, but there is little 
room for debate and analysis." 

Since the networks rarely, if 
ever, give coverage to the 
various congressional hearings, 
Halberstarn believes that to even 
hold them is a waste of time. 
Television is the most important 
conduit of information and use of 
other means of communications 
will not be effective in fostering 
and presenting debate. 

" We as Americans are less 
involved in voting because there 
is one missing link: it is the 
failure to connect the issues to 

levision," said Halber tam. He

We would like to make a minor 
correction to Monday's article, 
however, by informing Triton 
Times readers that the Saturday 
symposium was sponsored in part 
by the Californians for Nuclear 
Safeguards and in part by the 
UCSD Project Survival group. It is 
important for your readers to know 
that there is a campus organization 
concerned with the passage of 
Proposition 15 in June. The UCSD 
Project Survival group wi\) have 
an .organizational meeting this 
Monday night at 8 in the Revelle 
formal lounge. 

As the June election approaches, 
Project Survival's activities will 
increase significantly, as wi\) our 
need for co-workers. This week, 
for instance, a mid-day literature 
table appeared on the Revelle 
plaza. This wilJ be seen regularly

They're heroes, really, to an 
industry that followed their leads 
only after the two reporters had 
pretty thoroughly blazed a trail. 
There was a significant time lag 
between Woodward and Bern-
stein's first stories and the point 
when Watergate burst onto the 
wire services and the networks. 

David Halberst8m encountered 
the same phenomenon when he 
covered the Vietnam war in the 
early sixties for the New York 
Times. He wrote that the war 
wasn't working. By doing so, he 
and a few other reporters had a 
substantial effect on Kennedy's 
thinking about the viability of the 
American effort there. 

But, again, there was a lag, this 
time a much longer one, between 
the time he began writing his 
stories for his single newspaper 
and the time Americans living in 
small towns who get their news 
from the wire service stories in 
their local papers and from Walter 
Cronkite began to realize the 
futility of the effort.

Uebrenz also pointed out the

huddled with their children' 
watching their village burn. They 
may never have known what 
Halberstam had written about 
years earlier, but they did begin to 
sense something was wrong. The 
war became unpopular. 

That delay between the time the 
war began and the time the press 
started telling a passably complete 
story was fatal to a number of 
people. If the press had waited any

Halberstam ... 
Kennedy's trip to Europe in 1963 
and Nixon 's China trip as 
examples fi where reporters 
became less concerned with 
issues and more concerned with 
"media events." 

"This has not just served 
~ongress and the nation poorly, 
It has served the Presidency 
poorly," said Halberstam. "It 
has encouraged the last three 
presidents to go beyond the limits 
of their power. " 

Halberstam said that the 
president is the one who becomes 
fooled by the distortion of reality. 

Answering questions from the . 
audience, Halberstam said that 
he doesn't believe that networks 
manipulate the news but that 
they are more concerned with 
showing good film than reporting 
an important issue well. 

He said that the new book by 
Bob Woodward and Carl Bern-
. in, "The Final Days," which 
documents the last days of the 
Nixon presidency, "has a ring of 
unyielding truth." However, 
Halberstam believes the con-
troversial material in the book 
should have been reported 
earlier. He said the problems in 
the Nixon administration were 
not ideological but rather 
psychological. 

Liebrenz advised that students 
take classes that do not tie in 
directly with their major in order 
to learn about such skills as ac-
counting, statistics, or computer 
programming, skills that can be 
valuable in many different future 
careers. 

Uebrenz said that employers 
can always hire capable specialists 
or technicians, but that they often 
don't know where to go to find 
energetic, broadly-educated 
organizers and managerS. 

She pointed out the need for 
bringing employers into contact 
with liberal arts students, because 
such students often possess 
precisely the kinds of creative, 
enterprising abilities that are 
sought after in prospective 
managers and administrators.

sidious. The big thing after the 
resignation - bigger than ever 
before, in the sense that people 
appeared to mean it - was clean 
government. But government just 
doesn't stay clean very long, 
because many of the things it does 
are either repugnant or in-
comprehensible to people. "All the 
President's Men" - a tale of leaks, 
disloyalty, intimidation and flaws 
in organization and planning -
may not be such a popular film 
from a governmental point of view. 
Watergate, one would think, had to 
lead to as much covering of tail as 
it did to reform. 

For instance, Senate Bill 1, still 
sloshing around in Congress, 
contains provisions that would 
prohibit much of what Woodstein 
did to get their story. Several 
reporters' and editors' groups are 
vehemenUy opposed to it. 

S 1 in its present form was born 
of the Nixon administration. 

They might have called it 'rat-
fucking.' 

" Nixon Resigns; Gerald Ford is 
US's 38th President," ticks the 
teletype, and you wonder if it 
wouid tick sinu~ly if it coula: 

Happy ending? " President's 
Men" is already a period piece -
Woodward and Bernstein are 
getting fat on their laurels. We've 
touted them for ending an ad-
ministration, though they wouldn't 
have been able to do it without 
Cronkite. Halberstam certainly 
wasn't able to end a war. 

The press, with all its new self-
esteem, has a record of covering 
the two biggest stories since World 
War II timidly, at best. But the 
demands on it grow bigger every 
day. 

Are we learning anything? 

The allocation of space in the 
student center by the 
BudgeVResource Group (BRG) 
again dominated the Student 
Cooperative meeting Monday 
night. 

BRG members Monty Reed and 
Steve Wellington presented a set of 
different allocation plans and 
asked the Coop to approve the 
BRG's use of the pJans as a basis 
for space negotiations with the four 
colleges. 

Hearings. .. 
campus police and- various ad-
ministrators shoved demon-
strators in an effort to keep a space 
between demonstrators and Saxon. 

Communications student David 
Pickett said administrators were 
the. threatening element that day, 
while other witnesses told about 
several administrators who pushed 
through crowds of demonstrators 
trying to keep in front of Saxon. 

CIA Irreconclliable 
With Academic Freedom 

Marcuse, ,the noted political 
philosopher who appeared late 
Thursday afternoon, labelled the 
concepts espoused by Saxon during 
the question and answer period 
" utterly irreconciliable" with the 
standards of academic freedom 
because of what has been revealed 
about the CIA in Senate hearings 
and elsewhere. 

Marcuse's testimony was in-
terrupted by frequent objections 
from Gordon, who questioned the 
relevance of the philosopher's 
testimony to the charges against 
the students. Lugannani echoed 
this objection. 

Marcuse - who said he knows 
three of the charged students, 
Mahoney, Katisiaficas and 
Zamudio - said Saxon's assertion 
that the university cannot teach 
morality could have prompted the 
aneged violations. 

Saxon's statement put the 
student~ into a mood of "anger, 
frustration and disappointment," 
Marcuse said. That " frustration 
had to be aired," he added, and the 
demonstration was the immediate 
effect. 

In a response to a question from 
Gordon, however, Marcuse said 
blocking Saxon's progress or en-
dangering his safety would not 
have been justif ied by the 
President's answers at the ' 
question and answer session. 

Earlier in the day charged 
student Marco LiMandri was 
banned from the 'hearings by 
Lugannani for interrupting the 
proceedings. Later three more 
charged s tudents, Mahoney , 
George Katsiaficas and Robert 
Norberg, were also ordered to 
leave: 

At one point Literature professor 
Reinhard Lettau, a spectator, 
asked APIS professor Lugannani if 
he was a scientist, and told the 
hearing officer he should go to 
work writing for Reader's Digest 
magazine .

accept a final situation that in-
cluded the Triton Times occupying 
the space. 

The Coop voted 3~ with four 
abstentions to support the 
proposals. 

Many Coop members felt the 
major issue concerning the 
allocations was whether or not the 
Triton Times should move into the 
space that was designed and built 
to house it in the student center. 

The CoQP then voted again to 
support the BRG in its actions. The 
second vote was interpreted as a 
show of support for the BRG in the 
event it should decide on a plan 
that was against the wishes of ijle 
administration. 

Some members felt the space 
might be better used for housing 
other organizations. 

The Coop also approved BRG 
budget allocations totaling $10 644 
for spring quarter programs ~nd 
operating expenses. BRG mem-
bers said that this allocation 
exhausted the remaining 
unallocated student funds for this 
academic year.

charge of 25 cents. It will feature 
music from tapes, records and the 
radio, according to general 
coordinator Steve Papadapoulos 
and publicity coordinator Con-
stance Brown. 

Speaking in an interview Wed-
nesday, Papadapoulos said the 
"dances put on by the university 
only appeal to a narrow segment of 
the campus." By contrast, Brown 
said, Ubiquity hopes to appeal to 
everyone. 

The idea behind Ubiquity began 
last quarter when several students 
got together to form Ubiquity 
Unlimited. They received ap-
proximatiey $1000 from three 
sources: the Revelle Committee on 
College Affairs, the Revelle 

establishing itself as an 
organization contributing to the' 
campus community. 

The cover charge, along with soft 
drinks and juices that will be sold, 
will be used to help cover expenses. 
Papadapoulos says that Ubiquity is 

a completely non-profil establish-
ment, recycling any' money made. 
into improvements such as special 
lighting, decorations and an im-
proved sound system. 

Brown said the disco needs 
volunteers, such as managers to 
open and close, stock the disco and 
keep the staff organized, bar 
tenders and doorpeople. 

A meeting for volunteers is set 
for next Monday night at 7, in the 
Revelle formal lounge.

The UC San Diego music department will present two exciting concerts 
tonight and tomorrow night at eight in the Mandeville recital hall. Featured 
in tonight's performance entitled, "From Rags to Other Riches," is Cecil 
Lytle, assistant professor of music at UCSD, and noted piano player. 

Performing the music of such gifted Afro-American composers as 
Nathaniel Dett, C.T. Perkinson, De Sayles Gray, Charles Davis, and Scott 
Joplin, Lytle will display his keyboard talents that span both classical and 
jazz music. 

Saturday night, the UCSD Gospel Choir will perform under the direction of 
Lytle, and present a program of traditional gospel tunes ~s well as con-
temporary songs. Both concerts are free and open to the public. 

Tonight's piano recital is funded by Third College as part of a grant in 
studying Afro-American composers. Speaking of the composers and works 
he WOl 'd he playing, Lytle said for want of a better word they could be called 
" nationalistic." He explained that the composers were attempting to "wed" 
Eur:>pean classical traditions with what they believed to be Afro-Ameri~an 
gestures. Lytle sees similarities in what the black composers are domg 
today as compared with earlier European composers, 

"Chop:n was a nationalist attempting to wed what he believed to be the 
classiu) lJul'c.pean music indigenous to Polish music," he said. " You can 
look at Uszt as a composer, and see that he attempted to do virtually the 
same thing in a nationalistic posture, injecting into classical music what he 
considered to be indigenous things such as the " Hungarian Rhapsody." 

Since coming to UCSD from Grinnel College in Iowa two years ago, Lytle 
has put together a 52 member gospel choir. He is impressed most with the 
unity and "community feeling" of the choir, in that there are eleven people 
in it who have no ties with the university. The group has been regularly 
performing around San Diego and California in both churches and other 
settings. 

"One of the things that is so fascinating about gospel music is that it has

something. Ellington was a example. That clearly was a

music-it was always there. I eleven children so the process 
was there, working in the I was being worked into the

more. One of the most of my life was not playing for 
the Boston Symphony, that nature, because those things 
don't frighten me. The occurrence of my life came when

charge of the choir.

Back Door Climax 
For Billy Cobbam 

by Alex Bennett 
Staff Writer 

Billy Cobham and his new band 
dazzled a sold-out Backdoor 
audience last Monday night with a 
powerful show of musicianship 
that afterwards kept the audience 
calling for an encore long after the 
house-lights went on. 

Cobham is a jazz drummer who 
achieved a preeminent reputation 
for his work with the Mahavishnu 
Orchestra of yore. Since then, he 
has made a number of albums on 
his own, with other bands around 
him. 

This latest band is currently into 
the popular funk-rock vein of 
contemporary jazz. Their treat-
ment of the genre is not very 
original, but achieves distinction 
through the exceptionally dynamic 
and craftful talent of each mem-
ber, which makes for music that is 
tightly phrased and paced. The 
emphasis is on solos, which allow 
the musicians to bring their in-
dividual ideas to a full, rich 
development commensurate with 
Ujeir expertise. 

George Duke, who has played 
with Frank Zappa, was on 
keyboards. He infused his syn-
thesizer leads with a catchy in-
tensity with his wild pitch 
modulations. Alphonso Johnson of 
Weather Report was on bass. He 
sometimes enhanced his skillful 
playing with "fuzz and wah-wah." 
John Scofield played a guitar 
ranging from mellow, old-
fashioned jazz to a 
McLaughlinesque style. 

Together with Cobham, they 
applied to their music a joyful 
intenSity that was accented by a 
playful, jocular stage presence. At 
one point, Duke stopped in the 
middle of a number to ask Cobham 
about his biceps, and Johnson 
wanted to know why George was 
always hogging the microphone. 

The band opened with 
"Crosswinds," and continued with 

other old Cobham numbers, in-
cluding "On a Natural High" and 
"Red Baron." Then there was a 
long, rather mellow piece which 
was highlighted by acoustic guitar 
and a synthesizer solo that was like 
birdcalls. After a beautiful con-
clusion with mellotron and lead 
guitar, the musicians left the stage 
to Cobham. 
. Up to this point, Cobham had 
played with restraint, staying in 
the background. Now, with the 
concert more than halfway over, 
the audience was ready for his 
solo. He began quietly, developing 
his solo with subtle textures that 
lulled the ears with their 
remarkable richness. The pace 
slowly picked up, and Cobham's 
drumming assumed a powerful 
intensity that was searing in its 
precision and detail. The audience 
was caught up in his driving 
rhythms. Then something Clicked. 
and Cobham was drumming faster 
than the eye could follow. His 
playing achieved jackhammer 
force, his great arms practically 
stroboscopic. The band came back 
on, but Cobham was to be 
restrained no longer. He literally 
went wild on the drums, flailing 
them with unbridled energy, but 
never losing tightness with his 
band, who were driven by Cobham 
to an overwhelming ctimax. 

Cobham easily remains the best 
drummer I have ever seen. Beyond 
his extraordinary speed, there is 
the visual beauty of his playing, 
which comes from his sure, precise 
movements, and the decorations 
he adds, such as hitting the 
cymbals on both sides. But most 
essential is the depth of his 
drumming. His cleanly driving 
beats which never fail in ex-
citement, are always constructed 

wi~ a riÂ£.h complexity that in their 
sWiftness can scarcely be 
unravelled by the listener, much 
less be imitated by other drum-
mers.

Grand Old Game Time 
All riPlnow, grab your scorecards and pencils and pay attention! We 

only go tbrOUgh tJUs stuff one time each spring training around ~re, so 
,ou better get it filM now. 

You see, rookies, Major League baseball opened its season yesterday, 
the Padres begin at heme tonigIt, UC San Diego's Tritons are in the midst 
of a flgN for a playcif berth, and the amual intramural softball bonanza 
is about to get under way. That's right, it's baseball time. Like it or not , 
you are stuck with the Grand Old Game for the nen six montt.!. 

So to refresh your memories, you screwballs, I'm going to run down 
some basic baseball facts that you should all know in order to better 
understand our national pastime, and to help you get through the Long 
Summer. 

â¢ Ivy Wingo hit 25 homeruns in his illustrious seventeen-year American 
. League career. (This was 24 more home runs than Pinky Pittenger 

connected for.) 
â¢ Six-time National League batting champion, Rogers Hornsby, once 

said, "Any ballplayer that dOll't sign autographs for little kids ain't an 
American. He's a Communist. .. 

. ' Defn: ' Gopher Ball- -similar to a policeman's, but the 'tickets are 
cheaper. 

. â¢ The Infield Fly Rule: A batter is automatically out when he hits a fair 
ball (not including a line drive or an attempted bunt) which can be caught 
by an infielder with ordinary effort, when first and second, or first, 
second, arxl third bases are occupied, before two are out. Runners may 
advance at their own \i:lk.

The Triton baseball field was once marked by a sign, reading "UCSD Baseball Field", on 
Miramar Road. The sign was stolen, obviously by a quite rabid fan last Halloween. 
Spectators now can use a compass to find the field, or this easy-to-read map. The field is 
located just off of Miramar Road , across the street from the Veterans Hospital.

Finals Tonight 
by Evelyn Barata 

Staff Writer 
The San Diego Women's 

Intercollegiate Athletic Con-
ference (SDWIAC) basketball 
tournament, hosted by UC San 
Diego, concludes in the main gym 
this afternoon. Play beginsat4 pm, 
finishing the three days of com-
petition. 

Final league playoff games, in 
preparation for the tourney, were 
held at four SDWIAC schools 
earlier in the week. First seeded 
Grossmont, in the opening en-
counter, easily defeated Mesa 
College at Point Loma. 

UCSD, rated fourth, rallied from 
behind to top Palomar at 
Grossmont, while Imperial Valley, 

ANNOUNCEMENTS 

Mira Costa, Southwestern, and 
Point Lorna played in later games. 

The Tritons had to face 
Grossmont for a difficult 
assignment in the opening round of 

the SDWIAC finals this week. 'l"lre 
championship battle is scheduled 
for 8:'3if, WI h- lop-ranked 
Grossmont a good bet to be 
playing. 

Tomorrow's SO Re1ays: 
Trackmen Optimistic 

The UC San Diego track team 
will face some stiff competition in 
the San Diego Relays tomorrow at 
Balboa Stadium. 

competition will be Richard 
Petherbridge. He will throw the 
discus and carries a best mark of 
144'7". In the distance races UCSD 
will enter the 5000 meters and the 

. mile run. In the 5000, Jon Halperin 
and Doug Jacobson will take on a 
very talented field, while Pat 
Rooney and Kevin Young will be up 

. against a very fast group of milers. 
The Day Core Center will sponsor a 
rummage sole Saturday, from 9-3 
pm. The Center is look ing for 
donolions. The Doy Core Center is 
located easl of Ihe Police 5101 ion, 
and wesl of Matthews Field. There 
will be on open house and bake 
sole also. All are invited 10 come 
and browse. 

The relays, which are sponsored 
by the San Diego track club, 
usually bring in some top notch 
competitors. This year should be 
no exception, as many southland 
area schools, including UCLA and 
USC, are expected to be 
represented. 

UCSD will serxl nine men to 
compete in the event. Among them 
will be Kevin Morning, school 
record holder in the long jump 
(23'6Y,z"). Morning figures to have 
the best chance of the Tritons to do 
weir. He won the Kingsman Relays 
while setting a meet record, and 
then came back one week later to 
place fourth in the Northridge 
Relays. He will be hoping to reach 
the 24-foot level on Saturday. 

The final event of the day for the 
Tritons will be the 440 relay. A 
team of Kevin Morning, Lane 
Freestone, Eric Hendricks, and 
Eric Collings will try to better a 
season's best of 43: 1 seconds on 
Balboa Stadium's very fast track . 

In the upcoming weeks the UCSD 
track squad will travel to Santa 
Barbara for the Warrior Relays, to 
Wainut for the Mt. San Antonio 
Relays, and finally to Chapman 
College for the Orange 
Invitational.
