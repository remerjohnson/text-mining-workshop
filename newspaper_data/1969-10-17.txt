UCSD Moratorium Rally Features Savio,Marcuse 
by Rich Heiml i ch 

Times Staff Wr iter 
"Anyone who still believes the Vietnam war was 

a mistake is part of the problem and ' not of the solu-
tion. The political-social system in the U.S. has caused 
Vietnam; it was no mistake." Mario Savio, 1964 Ber-
keley Free Speech Movement leader, went on to argue 
that American intervention such as that in Vietnam 
began with our involvement in Russia's 1918 civil war. 
The American system, he noted, "is one of interven-
tion which created a 'cold war.' This moratorium should 
question the whole system." 

Other moratorium day speakers included five members 
of the UCSD faculty. Drs. Frank Halpern, Physics 
Department; Herbert Marcuse, Philosophy Department; 
Pic hard Popkin, Philosophy Department; Paul Salt man, 
Revelle College Provost; and Jerome Skolnick; Socio-
logy Department addressed the moratorium rally Wed-
nesday. 

Dr. Skolnick, who was the first to speak, commented 
upon a resolution recently proposed by Senator Charles 
E. Goodell (R.-N. Y.), which would require the with-
drawal of all American troops from Vietnam by the 
end of 1970. Dr. Skolnick noted that "57% of the A-
merican people support the Goodell bill." 

torium, but rather to Johnson, Nixon and Agnew: My 
theme for this day is the proper identification of the 
murderers." . 

He listed those responsible for the war as the mili-
tary bureaucracy, the military-industrial complex, the 
draft system, big business with its commercial interests, 
and the myth of an immediate Communist threat that 
allows for large military expenditures and promotions. 

Dr. Paul Saltman, Revelle College Provost, reviewed I 
his past as a 1949 graduate student in Paris where 
he was struck by a policeman while demonstrating 
against French-Indonesian policy in Vietnam. 

"The mistakes of the French have not been learned," 
he stressed. "The French were colonial but we are 
much the same, we are imposing our will on another 
people." 

Dr. Saltman declared that the Vietnam war is the 
greatest threat to the Democractic process, noting that 
" treaties have been broken in the name of democracy. 
We are ignoring the democratic concept of man's con-
cern for man." 

Philosophy professor Richard Popkin, felt that the 
free speech area of Revelle is an example of change 
for the better. "It is good to see members of the 
faculty here talking. We need a monumental demon-
stration.' ' 

Professor Popkin noted that Nixon will have a " half-
war." "Nixon doesn't want a humiliating end to the 
war. But it's been humiliating us all these years. 
We must struggle to end war now." 

Referring to the open letter from Hanoi supporting 
the moratorium he remarked, "Vice-President Agnew 
has called on ieaders of the moratorium to repudiate 
the support of 'the totalitarian government which has 
on its hands the blood of 40,000 Americans.' The 
Vice-President would like us to believe that the mora-
torium is to blame for the 'blood of 40,000 Americans.' 
The blame, however, cannot be attributed to the mora-

noted that the moratorium steering committee was put 
together in four or five days and pushed for a city-

Ned VanValkenburg announces his intention to turn in his 
Selective Service Card at rally last Tuesday in the plaza. 

Students, Airman Anounee 
Intention to Resist Military 

by Tom Baker --------Feature Editor 
Last Tuesday in Revelle Plaza two UCSD students publiclyan-

nounced that they had turned in their draft cards, while another 
man, a member of the United states Air Force, burned his mili-
tary ID card in token recognition of his " resignation" from the 
military. The rally as sponsored by the Friends of Resistance, 
a campus organization. 

Each of the two students gne a short address in which he des-
cribed how he had come to the conviction that he could no longer 
cooperate with the Selective Service System. Edward Van Valk-
enberg, a sophomore mathematics major, stated that, while he 
had once applied for conscientious objector status, he now felt 
that he could not cooperate with a system whose "function is to 
promote systematic murder" throughout the world. 

Davirl Petraitis, a Revelle sophomore, turned his draft card 
in to the La Jolla Friends Meeting on October 5, stating that " I 
could not partiCipate in the war machine after having realized the 
process of dehumanization which makes men into blind killers 
of their fellowmen." He further stated, "I have ... found that what 
exists in American society as the prime power is fear. It is fear 
and fear alone which would call me to a position against my con-
science. I refuse to let that fear run me. No longer am I silent. 
I am tired of that silence which sounds like compliCity." 

Robert J. Hudson, a member of the United States Air Force, 
burned his military identification card after declaring his resig-
nation from the armed forces. He stated that he had been AWOL 
for some :l7 days. He stated that supporting the American war 
machine, "even in a non-combatant capacity, would make me just 
as guilty of murder as the men who pull the triggers, drop the n _ 
palm and launch the missiles." 

, It was reported that Hudson was arrested immedlatelyupon leaving 
the campus by the San Diego police. lie was subsequ ntly turned 
over to th Shore Patrol.

UCLA, UCSD St dents 
Support Angela Da vis 

by Roger Showley 
Contributing Editor 
The results of this week 's re-

ferendum showed that a majority 
of students were against the Viet-
nam war, the Regents, Gov. Rea-
gan, and tuition. 

In a turnout of 1778 students 
(approximately 38%) graduates 
and undergraduates voted nine to 
one that Angela Davis should not 
be fired by the Board of Re-
gents. 

Similar percentages show up 
in the results of questions con-
cerned with the policies of Gov. 
Reagan and the war in Vietnam. 
On this last issue the ration was 
four to one in favor of "imme-
diate and total troop withdrawals' 
from the war zone. 

Results from other UC 
campuses, except for UCLA, were 
unavailable. At least four have 
not held the referendum, although 
both Riverside and Santa Bar-
bara have scheduled their poll 
for today. 

According to the UC LA AS Pre-
sident's office, 32~ of that cam-
pus' 28,000 students turned out. 
They voted on only five of the 
seven issues agreed on by the L'C 
Presidents three weeks ago. 

The results on both campuses 
are shown in the accompanying

College President Closes Paper 
by Paul Idecker 

FlTCHBU.RG, Mass. (CPS) -- The president 
of Fitchburg State College has shut down the campus 
student newspaper by refusing to sign checks (or 
the paper's printing costs. The action came as a 
mans of censoring an article by Black Panther 
Eldridge Cleave r reprinted from this month's Ram-
parts Magazine. 

John Antonelli, editor of the campus "Cycle" , 
confronted the president, James Hammond, at the 
print shop after the printer questioned whether or 
not he would be paid if the article ran in the news-
paper. Hammond confirmed the printer's suspicions 
by stating he would not sign a check for the print-
ing bill if the Cleaver article appeared in the 
paper. The weekly paper has not printed since Sept. 
22. 

On Tuesday evening the campus Student Govern-
ment Association unanimously approved the adoption 
of the code of ethics on freedom of the United States 
Students Press Association which states, in part, 
" ... The freedom of the student press must not be 
abridged by confiscation of issues or facilities; 
suspension of publication; academic, personal, or 
financial sanctions; arbitrary removal of staff 
members, or threats of these actions." By ignoring 
the desires of the elected representatives of the 
student body, Hammond has demonstrated his dis-
dain for their authority in such matters and his 
lack of concern for student opinion on his campus. 

In a meeting with the president following the 
SGA's ap;>roval of the USSPA code of ethlcs, 
Antonelli was told that if the students didn't have 
enough sense not to want to read this kind of ma-
terial then he would have to make the decision 
for them. It was at this meeting that Hammond 
again refused to sign checks for the newspaper 
as long as the Cleaver article was contained In 
the copy. 

Fitchburg State, a small teacher's college of 
about 2,000 ,tudents is under the Massachusetts 
Board of Education, which has the power to set 
a mandatory student activity fee. The president 
of each campus is charged with the responsibility 
for how the money will be spent. There are no 

student representatives on the Board, which sets 
the student tax. 

At Fitchburg, the college president has inter-
preted this state statute to mean that he should 
sign each check personally in addition to approving 
the student government' s proposed budget. This 
is not the case on many of the other state college 
campuses where more responsibility is placed in 
the hands of the students to determine how their 
l'I1oney will be spent. . 

In related activity, the editors offive Massachusetts 
state college newspapers met in Salem Sunday, 
Oct. 5, to lay the ground work for a union of state 
college student newspaper editors, similar to one 
established last year by student government as-
sociations. 

As a first step toward SOlidarity, the repre-
sentatives of the four papers agreed to run the 
controversial Cleaver article in their next issues. 
They also agreed to split the cost of at least 
of edition of the Fitchburg Cycle in order to 
inform students on that campus of the details 
surrounding the shut-down of their student paper. 

The papers also agreed to send a letter of con-
demantion to the State College Board of Trustees 
regarding the censorship at Fitchburg and to de-
mand that the case be given consideration under 
the "due process' clause of a "broad statement' 
of policy regarding student affairs on the campuses 
of the various state colleges passed recently by 
the Board. 

The policy proclaims its endorsement of "respon-
sible journalism' amond other things, adding that 
such matters be determined after "due process' 
which implies that at least a review of the facts 
in a case is necessary before action can be taken 
against a publication. The editors see Hammond's 
refusal to sign checks for the Cycle as a direct 
violation of the Board's resolution. 

The editors present at the salem conference 
are determmed to maintain their position as an 
independent student voice on the state college cam-
puses. They all recognize that what has happened 
at Fitchburg could easily happen on any of their 
campuses. Hence, they plan to continue pressing 
for clearly defined policies on the role of college 
administrators as Â·censorsÂ· of the campus news 
media.

Strikes Delay Muir Cafeferia 
by Jim MaGi 11 

Times ~taff Writer 
The opening of the school year creates not only havoc at the 

bookstore and at the cashier's and registrar' s offices, but the 
food services must begin to provide meals for the UCSD popu-
lation. This year the job is again being handled by Hi Continen-
tal through the leadership of John Lapetina. 

Contemporary Issues Tries New format 
This year's plan as outlined by Hi Continental varies in several 

ways from last year's. Previously, the student paid what was 
commonly referred to as inflated prices. The students handed 
over approximately $14.50 and recieved $19.00 worth of food . 
This, however, led to a markup in food prices. The current pro-
gram is based on an equity system of $1.00 of food for $1.00 cash. 
This system has enabled the prices of many foods to drop. In 
addition, the student may now choose from a variety of meal plans 
ranging from $13.50 to $19.50 a week.

else. Everybody has got to answer 
his own questions." 

Consequently, those with smaller appetities are no longer paying 
for the added cost of the big eaters under the previous program. 
Another additional advantage to this year's plan is the carryover 
of the meal card. The cards are now usable for the entire quarter. 
The residue on the cards at the end of the quarter is also redeem-
able at 50% face value provided the amound is more than $2.00 
and doesn't exceed $10.00. 

Problems in serving the UCSD community are taxing this first 
quarter. Due to numerous strikes during the summer, Muir Cafe-
teria construction has been delayed, with a January opening date 
now in sight. Meanwhile, the students oC both colleges are eating 
together in the Revelle Commons. This predicament has been 
advantageous to those desiring employment in the food services, 
however, as the cafete ria Cinds itse!! rUMing full force through-
out the day. Currently the caCeteria is providing between 200 

~ncl 300 students with' jobs. 

Peter Roste ( The Concept of 
Sexuality): "A lot more work goes 
into it than I thought. The teacher 
or TA must have backup informa-
tion for a whole group. Thorough 
knowledge of handling people is 
also necessary. Freshmen are 
raw and have a hard time fo r mu-
lating thoughts. We must be com-
petent at this." 

Gina Velasquez (The Existen-
tial Revo lution): .. One of the 
things that they are concerned 
with is who they are and what 
they are interested in. It's very 
difficult to help a group of stu-
dents who are new to college de-
cide what area they are interest-
ed in. They look to us to guide 
and help define areas that are 

The food service committee will also begin to organize this 
Call in the hopes of representing the student's views in the food 
service area. Student opinion in this part of the university com-
munity is extremely important. For the system to reach its goal 
of maximum avaliability, variety and flexibility at minimum cost, 
feedback is necessary from the students. The Hi Continental Co., 
through John Lapetian, is willing to work with the students in ac-
tivities ranging from special meals to picnic lunches or outings 
for 100 stUdents. 

(continued on page 12) 

Many students have suggested a column in the Triton Times 
1ealing with the food services on campus. The possibility of 
"Dear John" column allows the students an excellent platform 
from which to speak. Answers could be given directly in an ef-
fort to curb rumors of big business exploiting the impoverished 
students for huge profits. As John Lapetina has said, "The food 
services are for the students primarily." He is open to ideas so 
that he can interpret what the students want. 

Changes Announced in financial Aids 
by Portia LaTouche 
Times Staff t~r1ter 

One of the most misunderstood,Yet most valuable 
services to the students is the financial Aids and 
Scholarships Office, located in Bldg. 250, Matthews 
Campus. Needy students still are unaware of the 
many ways they may receive financial assistance 
for educational expenses. other UCSD students 
doubt the validitv of the criteria by which financial 
awards are determined. 

The new Financial Aids Officer and Associate 
Dean of student Affairs, Lawrence R. Dreyer, will 
make several changes this year in his efforts to 
augment and improve the services of the Financial 
Aids Office. 

The first major change involves a University-
wide financial aids application, which will be avai-
lable to UCSD students the Â£lrst week of November. 
Any undergraduate or graduate who anticipates fi-
nancial difficulties for the 1970-71 academic year 
should pick up this application and an information 

. sheet in Bldg. Z50 in November. The application 
deadline will prolXlbly be in mid-January, and no 
late applications will be considered, as they were 
this year, so it is advised that needy students 
file their applications as soon as possible. 

A common misconception is that the University 
of California receives unlimited funds from private 
and government agencies, to be allocated to its 
students. Unfortunately, this is not the case, so 
awards are made on a first-come basis among 
those who qualify. 

The major-types of prime-aid available are UC 
Grants-in Aid, Regents', President's and Chancel-
lor 's Scholarships; EducationalOpportunityGrants; 
Federal Work- Study Grants; ana otner scnolarships 
donated by private agencies, corporations, and or-
ganizations. 

If a student desires only a scholarship for aca-
de mic recognition, he may qualify for an honorariu m 
in which case no famlly financial statement is re-
quired. 

The Univer sity of California participates in the 
National Defense Education Act Program, offering 
National Defense Student loans to needy students, 
with 3% per annum interest on th unpaid halance. 
Accrual begins not less than nine months and not 
more than one year after graduation or withdrawal, 
and must be repaid within ten years. 

The Regents' Student Loans are available to stu-
dents who are not citizens of the U.S. The interest 
Is the same as with the alional Defense Student 
Loan, and the repayment period is five years. 

A third type of loan Is the Federally Insured Stu-
dent Loan. The Financial Aids Office r ommends 
this loan in cases where it cannot meet the needs 

of the students. This is a bank loan, based upon 
accomoctation rather than need. The partiCipating 
banks in the San Diego area are: Bank of America, 
Wells Fargo, United California, and Security Paci-
fic Bank. The interest is 7% per annum upon gra-
duation or withdrawal, and the student has up to 
ten years to repay. Since this is a bank loan, the 
bank has certain requirements: the student must be 
a resident of California, and at least a sophomore, 
plus other specifications. 

Student employment is an important source of 
money to help pay for college, and UCSD has two 
very good placement offices plus the Work- Study 
Program. Work-Study awards are mainly for under-
graduates whose families fall into a specified in-
come bracket established by the Federal Govern-
ment. students who wish to be on the Work- study 
Program must file a Financial Aids Application. 
There are both on and off-campus jobs available 
and the Office will make every attempt to place th: 
student in a job that is in his field of interest. 
Work-study is an excellent opportunity to obtain 
and develop many vocational skills. 

There are two placement office s to serve UCSD 
students, but they are not to be confused. The Ca-
r eer Placement Office, located in the east wing 
of Bldg. 250, Matthews Campus, is mainly for sen-
iors and graduates seeking permanent care~r em-
ployment. The second, located in the south end of 
250, is for summer and part-time work on and 
off-campus. udents desiring employment should 
come to the Office, fill out an employment card, 
and check the bulletin board where job listings 
are posted. students may file home typinl', c hild 
care and tutor cards, if they hav~ these skills. 

UCSD departments are requestefl to file job o-
penings with this Office. l:CSD stuflents are given 
preference over outsiders for employment on cam-
pus. 

The Student Corps is a pool of students who are 
available for intermittent employment. The e are 
all on-campus jobs, with no guarantee as to the du-
ration of each job. Students may inquire about and 
sign up for tudent Corps in the u ent Employ-
ment Office. 

Th Financial Aids OffIce highly I et'ommends 
the CaliforOla State Scholarship to al California 
resident students. If a student did rea onably well 
on th Scholastic Aptitude T 0::.1 (tl},,,,\,i ,1!i.ul t:::. 
vary for each grade freshmen applying for the lnO-
71 academic year hould have a minimum of 1092 
points math and verhal scores) and have a finan-
cial ne d, he hould come to the Scholar hip. Of-
fice immedlately to pick upan application. The dead-
line is December 10. Thi IS a 300per y ar awarfl 
to cover f es, ann i~ r newabl every yr. Thi 
is a fairly untapped, yet e cellent soure of aid.

October, 1969 

State of the Union 
The scenar io surrounding Wednesday's morator ium was charac-

teristic of the increasing polarization in this country, at one and 
the same time revealing the vitality and decadence of the American 
democratic system. 

The vitality was evidenced in what was a widespread partici-
pation in a legitimate means of de mocratic expression. Se~ing 
through the shallowness of claims that democracy was limIted 
merely to the ballot box, millions of Americans sought to cast 
their "vote" in a different manner Wednesday. 

In a system that should thrive on mass participation, such action 
should be seen as a healthy sign. 

But many took a far dimmer view of the situation. Governor 
Reagan accused the protestors. of providing the Communists with 
"comfort and aid. " 

Mayor Sam Yorty of Los Angeles proclaimed that participants 
in the demonstrations were "subversives, dupes, and people who 
don't understand." 

Vice President Agnew called upon the protesters to repudiate 
the support of the Hanoi government. . 

"N. Vietnam Chief Hails Moratorium," heralded the San DIego 
Union in a lead headline Wednesday morning. James Copley, 
the power behind the Union, employed the unorthodox device of 
a front-page editorial to urge his readers to "Stand Up Today" 
and support President Nixon. . 

Meanwhile, Nixon was playing his own game, borderlng at 
times on hypocrisy and paranoia. Seeing the gathering momentum 
of the impending moratorium, Nixon implied earlier in the week 
that he supported it. Then he qualifierl his support by adding: 
"If a President--any President- - allowed Ilis course to be set by 
those who demonstrate, he would betray the trust of all the rest. " 

The decadent element in the moratorium scenario is that such 
a legitimate mass-scale protest cannot take place without the red-
ooiting and charges of treason that have occurred. It is also a 
shame that the President should turn his back on the sincere ex-
pression of a considerable portion of the population. 

The success of the morator ium in achieving its goal--immediate 
withdrawal of troops from Vietnam--is doubtful. But its effect 
has obviously been fe It, if only by observing the paranoia of our 
national leaders. If a democ racy is healthy and vital, dissent 
such as occurred this week should not only be tolerate, it should 
be welcomed. The hyposcisy that has been the result of tllis pa-
ranoia speaks none too well for the State of the Union, October,

More Reflections on tlte Y Af Split 

------------R."; Ericson (Editor'S note: Mr. Erickson was a member 
of UCSD-YAF and is now a member of the Lib-
ertarian Alliance. He will be writing a regular 
column, "Quile Rightly,Â· for the Triton Times.) 

The confused CPS news article on the YAF 
National Convention, which appeared two weeks 
ago was only partially clarified by a letter to 
the' editor last week. There is more to be said 
about the matter. 

For years it has appeared as if the ultra-
conservative National Officp of YAF was wishing 
for a catacylysmic event which would precipitate 
Califorr.ia into the ocean. This would solve one 
of its lasting headaches: the almost exclusively 
libertarian nature of Cal-YAF. The National 
YAF has undertaken several purges of Cal-YAF 
leadership which will be discussed shortly, after 
a few things are clarified. 

The CPS article referred to the dissidents 
as "liberals." This is true in the classic sense 
of liberalism, i.e., the philosophy of individualism, 
that a government (if there must be one) should 
be so heavily restricted that it can only act 
as a protector of its citizens and never initiate 
coercive action against them. 

Contemporary "liberalism," while not having a 
specific pllilosophy, in common usage means the 
opposite. It means using the power of the state 
to force some groups of citizens to act for the 
supposed benefit of another group l usually the 
excuse is that the latter are Â·unfortunatesÂ· or 

"underprivileged. ',. 
Hopefully, now can be seen the mistake in claim-

ing that YAP liberals support "all similar issues 
that a modern McCarthy-type liberal wou Id 
support." For one thing, we oppose the draft. 
Ask what is McCarthy's stand on that? I could 
list any number of restrictive laws and governÂ· 
ment interferences with individual rights which 
McCarthy s upports, but that information is readily 
available elsewhere. 

Also, a distinction must be made between lib-
ertarians and conser vatives. Conservatives claim 
to support good old American traditions, or at 
least what they believe to be American traditions. 
Unfortunately they emphasize those traditions wllich 
are directly contrary to the philosophy of inÂ· 
dividualism, such as duty to God and Country 
(to be enforced by law, naturally). 

They are also in favor of following "national 
programs" to enhance the "glory of our countryÂ· 
and to acllieve the "national destinyÂ· (as a world 
power, perhaps). Oh! We musn't forget to 
"defend our national honor." The conservatives 
also desire to legislate morality through censor-
ship laws, antiÂ· sex and anti-drug laws . The pur-
pose, naturally, is to protect the "moral fiber of 

our nation." Libertarians don't think in terms 
of nations qr peoples, but in terms of individuals, 
and the rights of individuals. 

Now what about Cal-YAF? A few years ago 
Cal- YAF state Chairman was Dennis Turner, an 
anarchist. National YAF purged him because 
he was too radical. In his stead they appointed 
Rod Mannis, but he also proved to be una~ceptÂ­
able. Mannis was replaced with c().chatrmen 
Bill steel and Dana Rhoroocher. Steel is an 
objectivist and Rhorbarcher is a libertarian. They 
in turn, were purged for being too radical. Os-
tensibly the reasons given were that they smoked 
grass at board meeting and they "didn' t love the 
American Flag." 

As if it prove its ineptness, the National Office 
then appointed Pat Dowd as State Chairman. Dowd 
is also a libertarian. Tllings were obviously 
getting out of hand, so on August 18, shortly 
before the National Convention, the National Office 
purged Dowd and dissolved the entire state Board 
of Directors. In effect, they closed down Cal- YAF 
' to erase libertarian strength at the National Con-'~ 
vention. Throughout, National YAF couldn't ap-
point a conservative, because of the predominance 
of libertarians in Cal-YAF. 

It happens that UCSD-YAF, now the Libertarian 
Alliance, is among the dissident groups. The 
reason for associating with YAF was to quote 
the ,chapter"s chairman, Toni Sidney, "W\len I 
joined YAF it was as the result of many talks 
with Cal-YAF libertarians, I knew that the na-
tional organization was more traditionally con-
servative, but I didn't realize how much more." 

There were some programs on wllich we were 
able to collaborate. But these were difficulties 
and finally, after the inanities of the National 
Convention, UCSD- YAF disassociated itself from 
YAF. To quote Toni Sidney, "I had made my 
decision to quit YAF after their farce of a Na-
tiona! Convention. I was in total disagreement 
with their resolution to escalate the war in Viet-
nam, with their attempt to equate Christian morals 
and the capitalist economic system, with their 
blind support of any and all laws and with Mr. 
Buckley's ludicrous position that dope is a plague 
and therefore must be governmentally stamped 
out. 

Before I had mailed in my letter of resignation 
I recieved a phone call for National YAF informing 
me that William F. Buckley was gOing to speak 
at UCSD on Oct. 1 under the sponsorship of my 
YAP chapter. My response: "The hell he Is! 
I'm quitting YAF, my chapter has been dis-
solved, and I refuse to have anything to do with 
Buckley and his stratist policies." Needless 
to say, they weren't too happy. 

March Supports Soviet Jews ," 
by Stere Stry.er 

A march took place last Sunday protesting the 
oppressive policies of the Soviet government against 
the Jews. The march was a first step, a step 
coming a bit late, but, nonetheless, indicating 
that at last some people realize what is going 
on in the U.S.S.R. 

After a t raditional and somewhat unrelated ser-
vice at the Orthodox "shul" in Los Angeles, 
the group marched to Fairfax High School. There 
Councilman Tom Bradley; Ed Edelman; and Sen-
ator Alan Cranston, all front-line marchers , de-
livered somewhat trite speeches using cliches such 
as "Repression is evil and must be stopped; " 
"We must let all people of all skins be free; " 
and "Freedom is our goal, and we must achieve 
it now." All of these statements portray beauti. 
ful ideals, but how are they to be achieved? 

What courses of action are to be taken? The 
Soviet constitution states that all people of every 
nationality are to have equal rights and each nation-
ality is to be allowed to speak its own language. 
In the 1920's there were over 1300 books pub-
lished in Yiddish (a traditional , Jewish, Eastern-
European tongue); eighty Yiddish newspapers were 
also published. As of today no books have been 
published in Yiddish for ten years and there 
is only one Yiddish newspaper s till publishing 
in Russia. Furthermore, the Soviet government 
has made it next to impossible for Jews to emi-
grate to Is rael, the doors of emancipation are 
s hut tight. As welJ, the po tic y of the National 
Constitution for Churches states that if a group 
wants money for a house of wors llip all that 
need be done is to ask the state and the money 
shall be granted. Baptists have bu ildings and a 
national council of churches; the Jews have neither 
the buildings (94 synagogues as compared with 
453 two decades ago); nor the communication 
between synagogues; nor the religiOUS schools; 
nor the ability to practice their religion or their 
culture as they see fit. Worse, there are three 
million Jews behind the "curtain" of prejudice 

in Russia! Why, then, have we not awakwnwd to 
the graveness of this situation before now? And 
now that we are at least partially aware of the 
s ituation, what shall we do about it? 

Zev Yaroslavsky, a UCLA student who was in 
Russta for Simhat Torah (the "joyous" day when 
the first and last chapters of the Torah are read), 
poignantly reported the increasing oppression of 
the totalitarian state against the Jews. The inci-
dent in question occurred on Simhat Torah night. 
A group of about 500 people gathered to celebrate 
the holiday with dancing and song. (It Is theonly 
Jewish holiday which the Russian government allows 
the Jews to celebrate openiY). However, the police 
had cordoned off the area in which the synagogue 
was located in such a way as to force traffic 
to pass right by the synagogue. This, in turn, 
caused those congregating near the synagogue to 
move on. They did, Zev related the result: the 
happy group was turned into a panicked mob by 
the senseless attacks of the police. It was only 
after the police realized that there were forei-
gners 'watching this incident (Zev and friends ,. 
shouted obsenities at the police when they tried 
to beat a nearby boy) that the "marranos' ,,(swine) 
dispersed. 

Sunday's march ended on a happy note with 
Hassidlc dancing and singing, but the question 
remains, Are we going to allow the Russian Jews 
to remain"in silence" while we ourselves stay 
inactive as well? Or are we prepared (as more 
and more Soviet Jews are becoming) to take 
a stand and ensure that these oppressed human 
beings may be free from religious persecution? 

Concerned students should come to the Havdalah 
se rvice, Saturday at sundown in the student lounges 
at the University Lutheran Church. 

LETTERS AND COLUMNS should be 
submitted to the Triton Times office 
by Tuesday 4 p.m., and should be ty-
ped, double-space<l, with 10-70 mar-
ins. 

Rerelle (ollege-----------
Some Adv;ce to Potent;al Candidates 

---------. __ by (ar' Ne;burger 
Next week, Revelle students 

will be asked to elect repre-
sentatives to the Executive Com-
mittee and Committee on College 
Affairs (CCA). Many will find 
this difficult because they know 
little about the committees in-
volved or the candidates. The 
latter misfortune is due to the 
timing of the election at the be-
ginning of the school year rather 
than near the end, as will be 
true in future Rebelle elections, 
as well as the fact that this is 
the first election to occur under 
the new Revelle College bylaws, 
passed by students and faculty 
at the end of last year. The 
lack of election machinery, com-
bined with a menacing timesche-
dule, have forced what might be 
termed a "bare-bones' election. 

I cannot help the candidates 
expose their platforms here, but 
I hope that they succeed and those 
elected will be chosen for their 
ideas rather than how many 
friends the y have. In tllis 
column, 1 intend to clarify some 
facts about the bylaws, present 
my ideas about what the com-
mittees shou ld do, and indicate 
the qualities I feel students elec-
ted should have. 

I was a member of the Revelle 
College government which preÂ· 
ceeded the CCA and was in turn 
preceeded by the Committee on 
Student Affairs (COSA). COSA 
was created in response to 
students expressing a need to 
have a voice in college policies. 
It was elected, without specific 
instructions regarding its pur-
pose Spring 1967 and served 
quietly for one year, allocating 
vending machine money alloted 
to Revelle and considering re- I 
sldence hall visitation policies. 

At the end of its tenure, it issued 
a report calling for a new com-
mittee to draw up a constitution 
for a "Revelle College Govern-
ment" to replace it. 

RCG continued making minor 
decisions while searching for the 
right idea for a constitution. It 
wrote othe r pieces of legislation 
intended to implement policies 
under the future constitution, no-
tably regarding the Judicial Com-
mittee and use of amplification 
equipment of the plaza. In the 
spring quarter, while RCG was 
still searching for a satisfactory 
idea for a constitution, the Black 
students CoucH an d Mexican 
American Youth Associationpub-
lished their plan for the Third 
College, which included student 
membership 0 nth e Executive 
Committee. A member of RCG 
took up the idea of rewriting 
the faculty's Revelle College by-
laws, putting students on the Ex-
ecutive Committee, and including 
a second committee to deal with 
matters outside the scope of the 
Executive Com mittee. By the 
end of the year, the revised 
bylaws were approved by the 
faculty and students of Revelle. 

The Executive Committee is 
in some ways a legislative myth. 
It is an official committee of the 
Academic Senate and as such can-
not have boring student repre-
sentation. The bylaws , in effect. 
created another committee with 
the same name and a membersllip 
including two students as well as 
the two faculty members and 
the Provost. A tacit agreement 
exists that the three Senate comÂ· 
mittee members acknowledge the 
students' VOice, and that decisions 
be made by consensus orall mem-
bers. If the students are ignored, 

Can You Read This Ad 
In 10 Seconds? 

they can report this to the other 
students, and the faculty and ad-
ministration will have to face 
up to a hostile s tudent boIiy. 

The Executive Committee is 
primarily concerned with the 
academic program. Students ser-
ving on this committee s hould, 
in my opinion, be concerned with 
seeing that student ideas are 
translated into improvements in 
curriculum. The humanities se-
quence is an outstanding example. 
Last year, t he Executive Com-
mittee re jected the idea of in-
cluding non-Western culture in 
the sequence on the grounds that 
cour ses covering that area are 
in "experimental stages." Con-
s idering that the Muir humanities 
requirement may be taken in 
non-Western culture, the ir ex-
cuse seems hardly acceptable. 
A student elected to this com-
mittee will face two faculty mem-
bers and a provost with only a 
single student companion. 

CCA will follow in the foot-
steps of two other committees 
in looking after the "educational 
environment." However, it should 
be more concerned with imple-
menting the framework the other 
committees have created. The 
committee should concentrate on 
fostering communication between 
students and fac uHy outside the 
classroom through extra curric-
ular activities. It s hould not 
attempt to Â·compete " with AS 
or Muir through these activities. 
The activities should be aimed 
at increasing the opportunities 
for members of the UCSD com-
munity to participate in exper-
iences outside the c lassroom. 
Among others, CCA should conÂ· 
sider programs directed at those

Change Unlikely in Registration Procedures 
by Barbara J!neway 
Times Staff Writer 

The policy of the CSD Reg-
istrar and Admissions office Is 
to make everything as conven-
ient as possible for the student. 
According to Mr. Ronald J. Bow-
ker, Associate Registrar and Ad-
missions Officer, the process of 
" bull-pen" registration, carried 
on at San Diego State and other 
colleges, will never be employed 
here. That method is actually 
the easiest way for a registrar 's 
ofrice to get students enrolled 
in classes; the office is closed, 
tables are set up in a large area, 
and registrars sit at them while 
students stand in long lines wait-
ing to be enrolled or run fran-
tically fro m table to table as 
classes are closed out. The pro-
cess nearly becomes a riot. 

vacation and could not mall back 
any of the material until they re-
turned. Still, mail-inregistratlon 
has been much more successful 
here than the "bull-pen" method 
would have been. 

method of registration, probably 
on an "in-person" basis. Each 
student would co me into the office 
and sign up for his classes by 
talking directly with a registrar. 
The whole procedure would take 
place in three to four weeks, 
with priority given to upperclass-
men and freshmancoming in last. 

Classification by Majors 

Mr. Bowker wanted a less con-
fusing procedure, so it was de-
cided to have mail-in registra-
tion with the idea of letting 
students sit down at home a'nd 
fill out the material. One problem 
encountered was locating students 
during the summer. The office 
used students' permanent home 
addresses, but often they were on 

To complete registration, there 
are seven cards for the student 
to fill out. The facts on these 
cards are fed into the student 
Information System, a computer-
ized operation that serves all the 
campuses of the University of 
California. The system contains 
a massive amount of information 
about UC students. Just as a per-
son may fee I he is losing his 
identity in a complex organiza-
tion, Bowker says that while UCSD 
is tied to the state information sy-
stem, "We are having a problem 
keeping a campus identity." He 
thinks UCSD would be bett"!r off 
"if we can forget about them and 
go our own way." This may be 
feasible in coming years. 

The system of mailing out re-
gistration material will probably 
be workable until the University 
enrollment reaches 9000 stu-
dents. At this point, the amount 
of paperwork will be too great 
to process efficiently. Then the 
office will have to devise a new 

Bowker says a registration 
process handled entirely bycom-
puters is a long way off. There 
must be some contact between 
student and registrar, at least 
so that the student can say which 
classes he does and does not 
want, and so that the registrar 
can tell him which classes are 
available. 

The following figures on enroll-
ment for the fall quarter are 
subject to change, but are fairly 
accurate.

Harold Urey: 
A Man 
and His Moon 

by Steve Stryker 
Times Science Writer 

In view of the achievement of landing men on the moon and the wake of earthly 
problems left behind unsolved, it is appropriate to discuss some of the lunar 
findings, and what can be done to cu re the earthbound ills. One of the most know-
ledgeable people about the lunar world is Dr. Harold Urey. Dr. Urey is a Professor 
of Chemistry at Large at U.C., whose biggest achievement was the discovery of 
deuterium (heavy hydrogen) in 1934. 

He has also done research on isotopes, using the ratio between isotopes of. 
oxygen 16 and oxygen 18 in fossil remains of ancient shellfish to establish the 
temperatures of the waters in which these animals grew. In recent years he has 
done a comprehensive study of the solar system. He is a consultant to NASA's 
Lunar and Planetary Missions Board for 1969-70. 

On a crisp Tuesday morning three other Triton Times staffers and myself 
paid Dr. Urey a visit to discuss these topics. Dr. Urey was cordial and cheer-
ful as he strode into his small office, which was well-stocked with books, papers, 
and periodicals of the science he enjoys so well. 

I began the questioning by asking Dr. Urey whether the data gathered from the 
lunar soil samples supports his theory about the moon. In brief, Dr. Urey's 
theory is that the moon is a cold, lifeless and ancient body which was torn from the 
earth(note-: the following quotes are excerpts from Dr. Urey's conversation 
with us). Dr. Urey replied, " ... this data supports my moon theory partIy; namely, 
that the surface of the moon is very ancient. It Is proven by their (NASA's) data 
to be at least three billion years old, and the method of dating using a potassium-
argon compound is likely to be low. I suspect the correct date is four and a half 
billion years old. I have argued this date for twenty years. You can't bombard 
the surface of the moon without at the same time bombarding the earth, and 
since there are rocks on the earth that are at least three or three and a half 
billion years old, the intense collisional process on the moon must have occurred 
before that time. 

"Tbese findings are substantiated by some recent publications of Dr. Preston 
Cloud of CU.C.) Santa Barbara, namely that there are "tidal rocks" on the earth 
that have been placed under conditions of tides which shows that the moon was 
"attached" to the earth at least three billion years ago. Dr. Cloud believes the 
moon to be somewhere near three billion years old because of his data, but I 
doubt this very much." 

.. ... The way in which it (the lunar data) doesn't agree with my theories ... is 
whether or not the moon was captured by the earth or whether it escaped from 
the earth. I do not believe there is any evidence from this material in so far 
as that bears on the Question. The idea that the moon was captured by the earth 
appeals to my fancy because then the moon is an independent object; a far more 
important object in the history of the solar system than if it escaped from the 
earth. I think anyone can see that. But. of course, old Mother Nature may disagree 
with my fanciful ideas. Old Mother Nature is the one who is perfect and not what 
I think about It, you see. And as I said there is no evidence found now which answers 
the Question of the moon's origin." 

A bit later we discussed the possibilities of setting up a base on the moon. Dr. 
Urey qualUied our somewhat presumptous question by saying that if we could 
obtain sufficient oxygen and hydrogen supplies from the moon, as well as make 
food grow in the "dead," black moon soil, it is conceivable. but not to be realized 
for another generation at least. 

More plausible to Dr. Urey was the idea of setting up an astronomical observatory 
on the moon. SUch an undertaking would , if completed, give astronomers a greatly 
enhanced medium in which to view the solar system without the aberrations caused 
by the earth's atmosphere, or radio noise distorting their perspective. In order 
to do this, man would control the observatory from a moving body; namely, a space 
station. 

Before the above project even begins there will be nine more Apollo flights. 
From these flights many more moon samples will be collected. Dr. Urey would 
like these samples displayed in museums throughout the globe for all to view. 
If the upcoming flights are successful, this will be done. However, he added, 
"Various people have discussed the looks of the lunar rock that was shown in 
Washington. "T.R.B." discussed this in The New Republic and wasn 't terribly 
enthusiastic about It. I couldn't help but think how much more scientists see 
in a rock than the ordinary public does. 

We know how old it is, when Ii was last melted, what its chemical compos-
ition is, where it may have come from, etc. Note, however, that all of these 
things are immensely Interesting, and I'm sorry for peonle who aren't scientists 
and have no way of understanding how really fascinating the lunar rocks are." 

There is, however, one scientist who understands the space program well, but 
who Is . nonetheless, a critic of It. Dr. Eugene Shoemaker, chairman of Cal 
Tecb's division of geological sciences and a principal investigator for Apollo, 
firmly believes that the scientific achievements of the Apollo program could have 
been made with unmanned spacecraft three of four years ago at one-fifth the 
cost. In a special article in the Oct. 9 edition of the L.A. Times , Dr. Shoemaker 
retorted, "But Apollo is a poor system for exploring the moon. It was developed 
simply to land men and bring them back. There was no real thought given to how 
it would be used on the moon.' He acknowledged the flight of Apollo 11 as one 
to prove the reliability of the spacecraft system, but added that future Apollo 
flights will provide few SCientific returns. Further, he noted that of the two 
choices . regarding future space exploration--to land men on Mars or reduce 
manned flight to a secondary status--the latter is definitely more feasible be-
cause the former goal would Â·only result In a bigger transportation system, 
an ineffectual Apollo all over again. ' ~ 

Dr. Urey's perspective of the scleniific and economic worthiness of the manned 
space program is somewhat different. He feels that the 21 billion dollars already 
spent in this lunar undertaking should not be cut aU before the" job is completed. 
for this would be an extremely wasteful use of resources.Â· He is Interested 
in seeing what Information about the moon the upcoming nine Apollo flights will 
uncover, but he doesn't feel further exploration is really needed. As he put it, 
"geologists give you the impression that thay'd like to explore the moon in th 

same detail as the earth. Well, we live on the earth--that makes a great deal 
of difference as to in how much detail we wish to investigate it. I wish to in-
vestigate the moon sufficiently to understand its origin and what its past history 
may have been. And I do not see that it has value beyond that.Â· 

Dr. Urey went on to say that the expenses incurred in enacting the manned 
flights are minor. He said, Â·we spend about twice as much per year lor alcohol. 
The entire cost of the program is about one-half of one per cent of the gross 
national product. The gross national product is about a trillion dollars. We 
have approximately 200 million people in the U.S. That averages to about $5000 
per person. The wealth of the U.S. is enormous--it is primarily a matter of 
distribution. 

It is true we have some things that do not help us--lor example, the military 
establishment and the space program. other things we do, we do because we 
think we need to do them. We have to have a police force--we have to have it, 
that's all. And so there are things that we are spending our wealth for that do 
not contribute to our physical well-being. But after we pay for all these things, 
the average is compleltely adequate. For example. they talk about poor people 
not having enough food; well, we are paying people not to grow food! Why not 
stop paying people not to grow food, and transfer the food to the hungry people? 

... "The idea that saving expenditures on the space program will help solve 
poverty is a negligible solution to an enormously comples problem. The facts 
of the case are that what is needed is to transfer about $100 million a year from 
the more affluent sector of society to the less affluent sectors. We need to 'level 
down' the incomes of the rich. 

"The basic problem is not adequate materials, but equitable distribution. in 
order to modify the distribution fairly it would be extremely useful for people 
to be better educated--to have a marketable skill, so that they can earn in some 
way. As well it might be feasible to adjust taxes so that we don't penalize people 
with big incomes. but try to redistribute incomes a little bit .. ," 

However, people essentially don't care about poor relief, says Dr. lirey. The 
poverty areas of the U.S. are unreal places to most Americans. We can, he feels, 
take care of the poor in spite of the war in Vietnam, in spite of the space program, 
in spite of the military establishment; but, as Dr. Urey firmly reiterates, 'only 
if people begin to care.' 

Nearing the end of the interVIew, Dr. Urey explained that the public's apathy 
is also prevalent regarding their interest in science and the scientist. This is 
partially true because the public is very badly informed atout the endeavors 
of scientists today. Besides this, the public doesn't care enough to keep abreast 
of scientific events. As Dr. Urey put it, . ... the mooern scientist is the replica 
of the old priest of primitive times. We are trying to understand how the unh'erse 
exists and why the sun goes around the earth ... We are trying to modify natural 
things so they will be a benefit to people. We do not use prayers, exactly, but 
we do operate in other ways to accomplish this purpose." 

Another uaSlC misconception which the public has is tfie idea of scientific re-
search. Dr. Urey explicates this subject succinctly when he states that a dis-
covery which, at the time, might seem to be some sort of "play-object,Â· may, 
in a short time, become very useful industrially (such as his discovery of heavy 
hydrogen, or F. raday's investigation of electricity). The basic point he made 
in the above argument is "before you investigate, you do not know what is useful.' 
Dr. Urey summarized by saying that the public should be more interested in in-
tellectual pursuits--that to him the fascinatior, of knowing the earth goes around 
the sun is exciting, and although maybe not practically usefu I, this Information 
is knowledge valid for its own sake.

Beizer dits Draft Pamphlet Southeast Asia----Where Are We Going? 
by St eve Carpenter 
Times Staff W~iter 

"UCSD's new booklet, The UC 
student and the Draft, is not a 
major treatment at all, it 's 
merely a digest of much length-
ier treatments," stated Lance 
Beizer, presently Selective Ser-
vice affairs for all nine UC camp-
uses. 

Undertaken orginally by Les 
Akinson, of the United Campus 
Ministry; followed up by Dean 
George Murphy; John Erickson, 
for mer UCSD draft counselor; and 
finally edited by Lance Beizer, 
the booklet covers such topics 
as responsibilities of the student 
in relation to the SSS (Select-
ive Service System); classifica-

tion and appeal procedures; 1he 
pre-induction physical; defer-
ments; deliquents; and sugg-
estions in dealing with your' 'fr-
iendly local board." It has been 
distributed from a table located 
in Revelle Plaza since last Fri-
day, and will continue tobeavaiJ-
able there only through today. 

When asked when the booklet 
was first planned, Mr. Beizer 
declared, "I really can't say when 
the book was conceived or even 
really who did conceive it, but 
perhaps the best way of begilUl-
ing is to point to a book up here 
called 'The Draft and You.' " 
Mr. Rothenberg of UCLA was 
Mr. Beizer 's predecessor at the 
university-wide coordinating 
post.

He added, "Les Rothenberg's 
book 'The Draft and You' was 
not published until December of 
1968, so the only basically helP-
ful texts, as a matter of fact, 
which dealt with the draft law 
were the booklet by Les, 'You 
and the Draft' and this book 
'The Draft Law' by Jack Gri-
ffiths from Yale, a book of about 
70 pages. 

"Well Les's booklet was a bit 
shorter," continued Beizer, "It's 
34 pages long, and the hope was 
that a pamphlet of a shorter 
nature could be produced combin-
ing the best of a long treat-
ment; having reasonable comp-
lexity; dealing with the Selective 
Service regulations in enough 
detail to really satisfy some of 
the needs of the students; and also 

. featuring so me of the best of the 
short pamphlets that have been 
produced on many of the camp-
uses, many of which were as I short as two to four pages, that 
is to say, short enough to be 
read. " 

Mr. Beizer continued to say that 
there are hopes that the booklet 
will be distributed on university-
wide scale, and that students 
should not be stalsfied in using 
one such booklet as a cookbook 
or panacea, but rather should use 
a wide variety of sources. The 
Office of Student Affairs is also 
expected to release other infor-
mational pamphlets of this type 
in the near future.

tain background information on 
each of the speakers: 

Phillip Drath, speaking tonight 
on the pacifist point of view, 
is a Quaker, and has been a 
lifelong worker for peace. He 
helped to set up a center for 
Japanese-Americans returning 
from war internment. For 20 
years he has been a civil rights 
leader. Drath went to North 
Vietnam in 1967 on a Quaker 
Action Project to deliver medical 
supplies for treatment of bomb-
ing victims. 

Tran Van Dinh will speak 
Monday about the attitude of the 
Vietnamese people toward U.S. 
involvement in the war. Dinh 
was born in central Vietnam and 
educated at Hanoi University. He 
fought as a guerrilla with the 
Viet Minh Liberation Front 
against the French and Japanese 
during World War II. He is 
now a Washington-based free-
lance writer and is the author 
of a novel based on the war 
in Vietnam. 

General Victor H. Krulak will 
discuss Red China and America's 
future on Tuesday. He was com-
missioned as a second lieutenant 
in the U.S, Marine Corps in 
1934. In World War II he com-
manded a Marine parachute bat-
talion in the South Pacific. In 
the Korean War, General Krulak 
was Chief of staff of the First 
Marine Division. In 1964 he 
became a Lieutanent General and 
for four years commanded all 
Marines in the Pacific. 

William R. Corson, lecturing 
Wednesday on the 'other war' 
in Vietnam, is a former Marine 
Colonel. He wrote The Betrayal, 
a book which condemns American 
policy in Vietnam. In the book 
he attacks the escalation of the 
war; criticizes visiting American 
politicians; and strongly opposes 
General Westmoreland's search-
and-destroy missions, which he 
considers to have been the crucial 
misjudgement of the war. 

James D. Bell will speak on 
Thursday about other com-
mitments to the nations of South-
eas Asia. He is the U.S. Am-
bassador to Malaysia and has 
had a long career in foreign 
service. In 1964 he went with 
Attorney General Robert Kennedy 
to Southeast Asia, in connection 
with Indonesia's confrontation 
with Malaysia. 

The manager for the. Committee 
for Arts and Lectures, Mr. James 
S. Lombard, explains that the 
purpose of the lecture series 
is "to give both sides of the 
story,Â· and to focus on an issue 
which, since it has been contro-
versial for so long, needs to be 
presented objectively and inform-
atively. 

Reyelle flection ...

commuter students who have no

I must stress that the activities 
CCA plans should not be ends in 
themselves. I would oppose a 
candidate who views CCA as a 
high school-type "activities com-
mittee.Â· CCA's purpose is to 
develop Revelle into a Â·c~munÂ­
ity of scholars" where all mem-
bers participate and learn through 
each other outside as well as 
ins ide the classroom. Activities 
should be considered educational 
tools for achieving that purpose. 

In sum, students elected to 
both committees must be pre-

I pared to come up with strong 
id eas to benefit Reve lie in the 
committees' respective domains 
as well as work with other 
students and faculty to develop 
ideas into programs. In answer 
to any question of why I am not 
running for either office, I do 
not feel I have enough ideas 
relevant to their work this year.

Good Old Italian. Com 

by larry Johnson 
Times Arts Writer 

Dead are the wife and her lover, while the jusband stands over 
them with a bloody knife. Cornball , of course, great Italian corn-
ball. But, in opera, music is the thing and "Pagliacci" has plenty 
of what we go to the opera for : emotion-stirring song which is 
tuneful, yet richly powerful. If corn can provide a setting for that, 
then good for corn. 

The opening production of the San Diego Opera Company was 
an enjoyable experience, if not the best that one might have hoped 
for. The standout was Robert Nagy in the lead. A good actor, he 
is a great singer. His dramatic tenor brought out the spirit of 
the jealous actor-ClOwn, with a musical and dramatic flair that 
made the part live. 

Judith de Paul, his opposite, was good-looking, but was strained 
both as a singer and as an actress. In many passages her soprano 
sounded terribly artificial and forced, and her acting was mechan-
ical, with even her flirting wooden. Her voice has basically good 
quality and it may improve with experience . 

Ken Remo did a fine job as Beppe in "Pagliacci." and a very good 
job as the narrator in "The Moon," the short Carl Ort! opera 
that filled out the twin bill. Whlle he was an adequate actor, his 
roles called for more singing than acting and he was quite equal 
to the demands on his lyric tenor. He even managed the falsetto 
portions with remarkable purity and clarity. 

Julian Patrick, as Tonio in "Pagliacci" and as st. Peter in "The 
Moon," provided a steady but not outstanding performance in 
the baritone role. One of his primary problems was articulation: 
he could rarely be understood. He also had difficulty projecting 
in the lower registers. 

Even in opera one need not follow tradition slavishly, and the 
San Diego Opera need not explain itse lf for failing to pair the short 
"Pagliacci" with its usual partner, "Cavalleria Rusticana,." 
Yet why wdid the directors choose such a dud as "The Moon"? 
It doesn't sound bad on paper: an opera based on one of Grimm's 
Fairy Tales, concerning some people who steal the moon, an act 
which eventually leads to problems that st. Peter himself has to 
straighten out. But never did so short an opera seem so long â€¢ 
It dragged. Had the music been played in a faster tempo it would 
have helped, and the narrator might have been used to accelerate 
the slower portions of the action. At its best the music would 
hardly be memorable, and the rhymed couplets of the En"lish tran-
slation were otten horrible. "The Moon" did, however, provide 
an opportunity for some beautiful visual effects from the pro-
jector, including some color shots from Apollo 11. The sets here 
and for "Pagllacci" were rather well done, though all of "The 
Moon took place behing a gauze. 

On the strength of "Pagliacci" the evening was enjoyable. Some 
well-chosen operas are coming up this year, with good singers. 
"Tannhauser" will be next, in November, and UCSD students can 
obtain tickets at a great discount.

Everrthing but the Queen 

by Magnus Carti us 
Times Arts Writer 

The English pianist John Og-
den gave an English piano re-
cital in English Sherwood Hall 
on an English Tuesday evening. 
This English pianist opened his 
English recital with four English 
Impromptus by the English com-
poser Schubert. These four 
English Impromptus were play-
ed with English rhythms and 
English teml?i. Every EnglIsh 
English tempi. Every English 
not was played with peculiarly 
English precision. 

The remainder of the first 
half of this English recital con-
sisted of an English perform-
ance of the English Fantasie, 
also by the English composer 
Schubert. The English Allegro, 

the English Adagio, the English 
Scherzo and the English finale 
were all performed with an 
English tone, English style and 
EngJis h flair. 

After an English intermission 
this English pianist played two 
English Sonatas by the English 
composer Ludwig van Beethoven. 
The first English sonata was 
performed in an unquestionably 
English manner replete with a 
typically English fugue. This 
English recital closed with the 
English Sonata Appassionata and 
was performed with typical Eng-
lish a-passion. 

The English pianist played two 
English encores. It was an in-
sufferably English evening. (My 
deepest apologies to Eugene 10-

technology through research, development, and 
production of rockets, propellants, and advanced 
propulsion systems. 

As a forerunner in the development of solid-
propellant rockets, UTC provided the fiveÂ·segmen t, 
120Â·inchÂ·diameter booster motors for the highly 
successful Titan III-C space-launch vehicles . UTC 
also achieved notable success with its FW-4 high-
performance solid upper-stage rocket on the Scout, 
Thor, and Delta space-launch vehicles.

rocketry, employing a combination of solid and 
liquid rocket technology. Hybrid rockets developed 
by UTC are proving thei r worth in te rms of opera-
tional flexibility, safe ty and eco nomy. 

UTC has recen tly comple ted a multi million-
dollar complex to pe rform chemical milling work 
and to manufacture metal products, ranging from 
small machined parts to large rocket moto r cases. 

In addition, UTC has a continuous prog ram to

Lee Johnson, This years intramural dir ector. 

The guiding principle of this 
year 's intramural program, ac-
cording to intramura l director 
Lee Johnson, is to get as many 
students as poss ible to par tici-
pate . 

Johnson likes one- on-one, or 
individual sports. " I am stress-
ing as nnany individual act-
ivities as possible in the hope 
that a greater number of stu-
dents will be exposed to 
sports with carr y-ove r value," 
he said. 

Also part of Johnson's main 
stress is helping people find 
others of their own caliber and 
skill level to compete against. 

The duties of Lee as intra-
mural dir ec tor include setting up 
and or ganizing various activities 
and ensuring their success. This 
invo Ives organizing leagues, or-
ganizing referees, conducting a 
clas s in officiating, and posting 
publicity, among other duties. 

Johnson plans to carryon 
the programs Andy Skief, last 
year's intramural director, had 
developed, while attempting to 
expand them by getting more 
students involved. 

One of his plans is to dif-
ferentiate class leagues by 
skill; those involved would com-
pete in the calibre class they 
requested. This would involve 
more leagues with fewer teams 

and more even competition. 
Another is to [oster inter-

campus competition. This year, 
flag football is being played on 
the intra-campus level (Muir 
teams playing Muir teams), with 
the champions of Reve Ue and 
Muir then playing each other 
for the Chancellor's Trophy. 
Under this system commuters 
have a choice of participating 
in their campus's league or in 
open leagues. 

With only two campuses, 
this intra-campus competition 
followed by inter-campus champ-
ionships program is on a small 
scale at present. Looking ahead, 
however, the program will grow 
as more campuses a re added, 
with a possible by-product oC 
building campus spirit. 

Lee's assistant this year is 
Ron stutheit, an undergraduate 
at UCSD. " He's energetic and 
rea lly been a great help." 
Johnson said, " especially in 
he lping me get organized and 

COVE THEATRE ~ 

oriented at UCSD." 
Outside of his duties as 

intramural director, Johnson is 
wor king toward his doctorate in 
human behavior at USlU, a 
branch of Cal Wester n. 

His previous experience re-
lating to intramural activities 
includes three years of running 
the program at University of 
Redlands and one year of help-
ing with the program at San 
Diego state as an assistant. When 
asked why he came to UCSD, 
Lee replied straightforwardly, 
"This is the best place in 
California to work. 

"Dr. Ted For bes (PE Dept. 
chairnnan) and Howard Hunt (Di-
rector of Athletics) ar e fine men 
to work for and have spent a 
great deal of time helping me. 

"Dr . Forbes is an expert 
in physical education and 100% 
in favor of a good intramural 
program. He has also helped 
me with my volleyooll game. 
Mr. Hunt, of course, is invalu-
able when one goes to Del Mar 
during racing season." Johnson 
expressed his special indebted-
ness to Chuck Millenbah of the 
PE Dept. for suggesting he 

apply to UCSD. 
Quite an athlete in his own 

right (a three-year college All-
American shotputter), Johnson 
graduated Crom the University 
of Redlands as an economics and 
PE major and went on to get 
his master's degree at San 
Diego State (where he was also 
assistant track coach in charge 
of field events tor two years. 

The organization of the 1M 
program is in good hands , but 
student interest is required to 
make the program run. Any 
students interested in an activ-
ity should contact Lee Johnson 
in the 1M office. He will do his 
best to find competition for any 
student in any activity, and will 
organize any activity for which 
there are suificiently many to 
make competition practical and 
worthwhile. 

In Johnson' s opinion, intra-
mural sports play a far greater 
role than intercollegiate ath-
letics on the campus today. 
Students are certainly encouraged 
to utilize what is probably the 
nost rewarding athletic program 
at UCSD--the intramurals pro-
gram.

Four teams fell victim to the 
Triton harriers as UCSDclaimed 
its third straight victory in Chap-
man's Hart Par k last Saturda v. 

The final tally was UCSD 36, 
Champman 38, Azusa Pacific 55 , 
Pasadena 102, and Cal Lutheran 
119. 

A pr oud Coach Bob Wilson 
called the win a t r ue team effort 
and praised freshman Bob Horgan 
for his marked improvement. 
Wilson was also encouraged by 
the fact thatleader s King and Avol 
were able to run very close to 
the 5 :20- per- mile pace that has 
been stressed in workouts. The 
rest of the tea m should soon 
be able to achieve the same 
pace and shorten the gap separat-
ing the first five runners. 

Following the meet, the team 
elected Revelle junior Clark 
Rosen team captain for the 1969 
season. 

Tomorrow the Triton mileage 
merchants meet the Navy Seal 
Team Number One and the San 
Diego Track and Field Club "B" 
team (which includes UCSD grad 
students Bill Boram and Bob 
Wilson) on our course at 11. 

Due to extremely heavy play 
on all UCSD tennis courts by 
other than Univers ity personnel 
and the subsequent number of 
complaints received from stu-
dents , faculty and s taff because 
of these crowded conditions , mea-
sures must be taken to ensure 
that campus personnel have an 
opportunity to play during the time 
and day of their choice when 
courts are available. 

Effective Saturday, October 18, 
all courts adjacent to the Gym-
nasium (between Muir and Revelle 
colleges) will be on a reserved 
oosis. Students and faculty/ staff 
recreation card holders may re-
serve one of the six courts by 
either phoning Ext. 2284 or by 
coming in person to the equip-

nasium.

by Dr. Ted Forbes, Chairman, 
Department of Physical Education 

Throughout the history of rn~l'}f s 
efforts at progress, it is all 
too apparent that, while the poten-
tial values and importance of 
physical education in its broadest 
sense are often recognized and 
commented upon by the great 
leaders and foremost thinkers 
of the various ~ges, at no time 
since the Grecian era have these 
values been fully exploited. 

Never, up to and including the 
present day, has there been 
achieved the widespread and gen-
eral understanding of the true 
nature and potentialities of phy-
sical education necessary to its 
full development and function. 

In plalUJing the academic curr-
iculum for UCSD, the Educational 
Policy Committee early recog-
nized the importance of physical 
activity by recommending a de-
partment of physical education for 
this campus. Thus a unique oppor-
tunity was presented to achieve 
this understanding and realize 
the full potential of outstanding 
programs of which the depart-
ment could be proud and which 
were to become an integral part 
of the educational curriculum. 

The resulting philosophy was 
one of a basic program of phy-
sical education, intramural 
sports, recreation, and inter-

oC court use. 
The cour ts will be patrolled on 

Satur days and Sundays and during 
afternoon recreation hours by the 
Physical Education Department to 
assure that all r ights of Univ-
ersity persolUJel a re protected. 
Children may use these courts 
only when playing with a r ecrea-
tion card holder.

collegiate athletics offering all 
students an opportunity to par-
ticipate in a large variety of 
~rtivities regardless of ability. 

intercollegiate athletics at 
UCSD is a justifiable and desir-
able experience only to the ex-
tent that the program contributes 
to the health, welfare and gen-
eral education of the participat-
ing students. Its existence is for 
those students emerging from 
basic physical education achvi y 
courses, Intramural sports, and 
for those others who are skilled 
individuals desiring a higher level 
of competition. 

Benefits are derived when the 
athlete experiences a feeling of 
self- satisfaction and achieve-
ment. Paricipation in the 
program is solely for the 
educational benefits derived. It 
is not to be Judged in terms of 
winning and lO Sing, publirity, or 
for the satisfaction of spec ial 
interest groups. 

To assure absolute institutional 
control of the entire intercolleg-
iate program, all funds are der-
ived from student registration 
fees.

Viet Cong flags and a ,tl-imper-
ialist slogans, studen -s wormed 
their way down Telerraph Ave. 
among the traffic lanes, slapping 
M-Day, slapping M-Day hand-
bills on rain-wet cars. 

About 1,000 demonstrators pa-
raded down the city-sanctioned 
route in the shopping district 
along Shattuck Ave., where they 
passed out printed sheets and 
tried to convince merchants that 
Wednesday was no normal bussi-
ness day. Businessmenslammed 
doors and flipped "open' signs 
over to read "closed" as the 
protesters flowed past their 
shops. Later, as rain dispersed 
the demonstrators, most bus i-
nesses opened again. 

Stanford's evening rally was 
one of the largest moratorium 
day gatherings in the state; more 
than 7,000 persons jammed two 
auditoriums to hear obel-prize 
winning scientist Linus Pauling 
declare: " We have an over-
whelming duty. We must force 

Cont. Issues

feasible within the time that we 
are alloted." 

Stuart Reder (Quality of Life-
Environmental Pollution and Pop-
ulation Control): "To live it is to 

get involved in it. You can rap 
about pollution and come to an 
intellectual conclusion about it, 

but unless you're in a position 
to see the consequences, you can-
not get into it." 

Since the Muir Contemporary 
Issues program was instigated as 
an educational experiment, it is 
entirely fitting that these changes 
are taking place. The wide assort-
ment of topics being covered 
and the variety of methods being 
tested are in complete accord with 
the experimental nature of the 
course. But whether they will suc-
ceed, and what will be the end 

result of this year s program is 
not yet predictable. In the words 
of one discussion leader: "I can 
see a lot of opportunities, but op-
portunities aren't facts."

At UCSB, 2,000 students 
attended a rally on campus, and 
later joined other Santa Bar-
barans in a silent vigil at the 
Santa Barbara Art Museum and 
in the distrubution of handbills. 

A peaceful march downtownJo 
the local park highlighted events 
at UC Santa Cruz. Classes were 
not cnacelled, strickly speaking, 
as most of the faculty adhered 
to the obligation to teach by mak-
ing arrangements to hold class 
at other times during the week. 

The names of San Diego Coun-
ty's war dead, painted on a fence 
at San Diego state College, were 
covered by whitewash. A mes-
sage left behind observed, "You 
ha ve been visited by Minutemen."

wide committee. He expressed 
an interest in plans for next 
month's moratorium march down 
Broadway in San Diego. "We 
must influence the non-academic 
community." 

Dr. Herhert Marcuse said he 
was proud of Hanoi's support, 
expressed in its open letter to 
the American people. He stated 
that the problem of Vietnam was 
rooted in the U.S. system. 

Marcuse argued that capitalism 
is "a rational business that 
doesn't waste money on anything 
harmful to the system. Only 
a change in ~he system will bring 
about a change in the policy. I 

Without (a change) the insanity 
will go on." 

Because "the system is sus-
pect" it is "getting jittery" and 
"increasing military spending." 
He pointed out the similarity bet-
ween Vietnam and the problem 
of Angela Davis, saying that "all 
undesirables will be eliminated by 
the system" because critical op-
inion is thought bad and "must 
remain within four walls.' 

He urged the rally audience to 
gather more strength for next 
month's moratorium. .. Wilen 
and if the system escalates, you 
must escalate too. youth must 
demand an education for life in-
stead of one for death. 

"Some would call me a pessi-

mist. I think of myself as be-
ing a ruthless optimist," Mar-
cuse said of himself. He fin-
ished with a hearty "good luck," 
received a standing ovation, and 
went off for a television interview. 

Professor Salt man came tack 
to introduce Roy Huggins, a Hol-
lywood producer , and Mr. Huggins 
provided some comic relief. Mr. 
Huggins referred to the mora-
torium as "Mr. Nixon's Seventh 
Crisis." (Nixon wrote a book en-
titled SIX CRISES) "Seven times 
in the last five days Nixon said 
that the moratorium would have 
no effect on him. Way down 
in the small of his mind Nixon 
knew he was Lyndon Johnson," 
the producer quipped.

At Pratt & Whitney Aircraft "ceiling and visibility unlimited" 
is not just an expression_ For example, the President of our 
parent corporation joined P&WA only two years after receivÂ· 
ing an engineering degree_ The preceding President, now 
Chairman, never worked for any other company. The current 
President of P&WA started in our engineering department 
as an experimental engineer and moved up to his present 
position. In fact, the majority of our senior officers all have 
one thing in common - degrees in an engineering or 
scientific field. 
To insure CAVUÂ·, we select our engineers and scientists 
carefully. Motivate them well. Give them the equipment and 
facilities only a leader can provide. Offer them company-paid, 
graduate education opportunities. Encourage them to push 
into fields that have not been explored before. Keep them 
reaching for a little bit more responsibility than they can 
manage. Reward them well when they do manage it. 
Your degree can be a B.S., M.S., or Ph.D. in: MECHANICAL â€¢
