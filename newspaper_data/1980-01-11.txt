Chancellor's Search Back to Go 
By Jeff Beresford· Howe 

News Editor 
the two sources say, the list was weak on women and Several letters of endorsement, includmg one from 

the alumni association, which has a representative on 
the committee, have been received . by the group. 
support for the vice chancellor, described as" sparse " 
at the beginning of deliberations, has begun to pick 
up. 

The Chancellor's search committee meets again in 
Los Angeles today, still not much closer to picking a 
chief executive for UCSD than it was three months 
ago. 

The committee is still facing over 200 
applications, the same as when the committee tlad its 
first meeting last quarter. 

The cause of the committee's slow progress, 
according to two committee members, who asked for 
anonymity, is concem over the number of women 
and minority applicants accepted for serious 
consideration by a subcommittee composed of the 
members of the committee as a whole minus the 
Rej[ents. " 

The subcommittee suhmitted a list of "10 to 20 
applicants they thought merited serious 
consideration at the Dec. 12 committee meeting, but, 

minorities. 
When the committee asked its chair, UC President 

David Saxon, which of the names he thought might 
be qua~fied for the chancellorship, he named a 
shortened list of three to five that included no women 
and no minorities. 

Several members objected to that list, and the 
committee began an extended discussion of the role 
of women and minorities in running a university.~ 

And what one member deS<.. \ed as the " recurring 
debate " over Vice Chancellor of Academic Affairs 
Paul Saltrnan and his possible selection as chancellor 
was injected into the discussion. 

Finally, the s<.>urces say, the committee decided to 
wait until today'll meeting to begin looking at any 
narrowed list of contenders for the post. 

Saltrnan remains one of the most volatile issues 
before the committee, according to its mem~rs. 

Some of the five Regents, especiaOy, are 
examining Saltman's candidacy carefully, the two 

members say. 
" The cornnlittee could still choose a chancellor by 

March or even February, but its choice must be 
approved by its chairman, Saxon, who wiD make the 
final recommendation to the Board of Resents. 

No plans have been made for the COiiarilittee to 
return to the UCSD campus before the final selection 
is made, though the committee also has not ruled out 
such a visit. 

The committee' s ~arch was precipitated ~ the 
summer resignation of ChanceDor William MctJroy.

Brown Wants University Building 
,Fund Shifted to Energy Proposal 

By CarolI" Friday .' 
Sacrunento Cor.respondent 

In his annual state of the state 
addre.. yesterday, Gov. Brown 
described for the first time his plan to 
take mon~y from the Capital OutJay 
Fund for Higher Education and use it 
for an ambitious energy conservation 
pf()jram. 

The OutJay Fund has been used to 
finance buildings for the state's colleges 
and universities, but Brown has 
proposed that half of that fund be used 
for what he caUs the Energy Resources 
Fund. 

"I believe California should adopt a 
policy that revenues derived from non· 
renewable resources should be 
invested in renewable resources," said 
Brown. 

.. For that reason I am proposillj the 
creation of an Energy Resource. fund 
10 that a portion of the additional 
tidelands revenue can be targeted for 
renewable source projects to suplement 
California's self sufficiency and direct 
our de~e~y from non·renewable 

. resources, said Brown. . 
Since the mici 1950s revenues 

derived bam the aaIe of oil produced by 
private companies on the stateowned 
tideland oil properties stretchinc.. from 
Santa Barbara to aouth of I...ong Beach 
have been let aaide for the Capital 
OutIa, FWMI. 

~Ie lunda are used to finance 

remodeling and building needs of the 
Univers~ty of California, .the California 
State University and the State 
community colleges, subject to the 
discretion of the governor. 

Two years ~go it was predicted the 
fund would dry up by 1982, according 
to the State Lands Commission. 

But deregulation of heavy crude oil 
by President Carter last fall made the 
fund a windfall. In the fiscal year of 
1980-81, the revenues from the 
tidelands oil are expected to increase 
from the current $195 million to $270 
million in 1980-81 and $365 million in 
1981·82. 

Faced with declining student 
enrollment in the mid 1980s, the state 
is asking the legislature to divide the 
fund in third., annually alloting equal 
portions to higher education, to the 
newly conceived Energy and 
Resources Fund and to a general fund, 
accordi., to Mary AM Graves, the 
governor s state finance director. 

co We are looking forward to a period 
of declining enrolhnent which does not

fund," said Graves. U.., a formula, baled on the

1975 Warren Doimitory Theft 
By Caitlin Horowitz 

Staff Writer 
After five years worth of lellal 

proceedings, six former UCSD 
students were awarded $2100 of UC 
Regents m?ney Wednesd~y.to pay for 
stereo equIpment a muruclpal court 
says they lost as a result of university 
negligence. 

Though no apparent precedents 
were seth attorney for the plaintiffs 
Frank tinney emphasized the 
imporlance of the case because it 
focuses upon the responsibility a 

_campus has to and for its students. 
" It was a matter of principle," said 

Finney who, in his line o( defense 
maintainted that a university has the 
ultimate task of ' providing a safe 
camj)Us environment. And according 
tc rUlney, UCSD seriously erred. 

" The University was negligent. The 
students were issued a letter assuring 
·them that there would be adequate 
security for them to leave their valuable 
in the dorm rooms over the winter 
vacation. The fact is that there was no 
safe place for storage. 

" The University knew that ·it was a 
period of high crime, they knew that the 
(dorm) lock hadn' t been changed for 
over three years and they even knew 

. that there had been numerous thefts 
throughout the preceding year," he 
said. 

The suit began in 1975 during the 
break at Christmas. Accordin~ to an 
article carried by The GuardIan last 
year, Warren College resident students 
had been iasued a letter by the then . 
Resident Dean Paula Hui assuring 
them that their belongings, stereos, 
would be safe if left locked in closets. 
The doors and windows were locked, 
those locks were not changed. 

Consequently, burglars, not -slowed 
by locks they had broken before, 
got into the dorms and took several 
stereo outfits. All told, the property lost 
was estimated at $4999. Police 
investigated and found no significant 
clues . 

The students then sought the legal 
advice of on-campus services but soon 
had to seek outside help when they 
were advised that their campus 
attorney had a conflict of interest and 
could not represent them. The father of 

one of the plaintiffs, San Franailco 
attorney Robert Brown, subtequently 
became the students' .:ounsel. 

The matter went to the San DeiJo 
Municipal Ct. where it languished for 
three years before a settlement hearing 
convened to try to reach an agreement; 
however, no accord was struck and the 
matter went back into the Municipal 
pool to come up again, this time for 
trial. 

The fact that there was a cash award 
made to the students suggests some 
responsibility, if not guilt, on the part of

McElroy Seeks 
Apts to Fill 
Villa LJ Void 

By John Hondros 
Auociate New. Editor 

Chancellor McElroy says he doubts 
the university can halt the conversion 
to condominiums of the Villa La Jolla 
apartments, but says UCSD is 
proposing that 200 apartments be built 
on caJ11pus to compensate for this loss. 

McElroy said last night that an item 
will go before the UC Regents this 
month proposing that additional on· 
campus housing be built near Mesa 
apartments. The plans call for 150 
student units and 50 faculty units 
which, he said, would " more than 

co~nsate for what we're losing. '" 
The university will appeal on Jan. 

22 the San Diego Planning 
Commission's decision to allow for the 
conversion of the 500 apartments near 
campus. About 250 students and 25 
faculty and staff members are currendy 
renting at the Villa La Jolla 
apartments. 

The Planning Commission voted 
last month that it had no say in the 
matter since, they claimed, there is no 
indication in the University 
Community Plan that condominium 
conversions are not allowed. . 

McElroy said he hop~s the 
university can convince the City 
Council to delay the.... conversion 
planned by E.E.S. La Jolla Associates

Indecision, Incoherence Preview 
of the Democratic Convention 

By Ran Anbar 
It looks like it's going to be4 wild scramble to 

the finish for the Democratic nomination for the 
presidency. ' 

RlJn Anbar is a former Guardian news editor. 
He is now a medical .tuMnt at the University 
01 Chica,o. 

The first .t~ will be a deadlocked 
convention: Here I why: 

President Carter'. current popularity wiD faU 
to near its previous record-low level. before the 
primaries ,ll' over. If the Iranian and 

.. Afghani.Ian 01 .. eXtend much longer, the 
American people will become impatient wi.th 
the President and he will lose much of our 
support. If, hoYi ever, the crisis i. resolved to 
people'. satisfaction in short order, Americans 
wiD have eeveral month. in which to forget this 
.uccess and refocus on the domestic difficulties 
that were Carter'. lOre point in the fint place. 
Either way, Carter i. presendy riding on the 
peak of hi. popularity. 

Are Americans 10 fickle that they wil forget 
a Carter triumph over the Iranian crisis? Of 
course. Recall, for a moment, how quickly the 
Camp David Mideast treaty aura faded from 
the White House. And don't forget Carter'. 
charges that American. no Ionter have 
confidence, followed by a desperate cabinet 
shuffle primarily aimed at gearing up a faltering 
political machine. Thi. i. what .we saw in the 
pre.lran day.. This is what we will see in the 
po.t-Iran day •. 

And then there'. Senator Kennedy who, if he 
had waited to announce hi. candidacy for as 
long a. he had originally intenclecl, would 
probably have ended up not nmnilll at all. An 
Iranian mullah and some .tudents would have 
seen to that bl, unifying the United States 
behind Carter. But now that he'. in the race, 
Teddy i. in to .tay. JFK was no quitter, and his 
brother isn't Roing to be either. 

Kennedy will, of couree, regain ~me of the 
around he hal Io.t to Carter in recent week. a. 
Carter begins Ioaing favor in American eyes. 
But the senator hal demon.trated a aurprilina 
lack of competence in conducting hi. carnpaip 
and hi. mouth ever Iince he entered the race. 
Perha". he can't run and talk at the same lime. 
Kennedy has worked hard to remove hi. 
my.tique. Unintentionally. Hi. popularity could 
never rise to ita previous highs. And .a, out 01 
the eIi.tant horizon, further than where the sun 
sets, we see the Ui annour of California'. own 
Gov. Brown. In a lotaIly spaced-out way 
Brown may end up captwirqr much of the 
elwive anti-Cart. vote that baa traveled from 
c.rter to Kenned}" back to Carter, and now to 
Brown. AlmoaI Brownian motion, one milht

And where does this leaw lit? With a 
deedloclced convention betWeen AmIric.' • . 
own Jimmy, Teddy and .J.ry. So what then? 

Step two: Resurrecting the ghost of Hubert 
Humphrey. 

Jimmy won't give up. If he didn't give up 
when his popularity was at an all-time low, do 
you think he1J teD his hard·earned delegates to 
look elsewhere for a great moral leader? 

And there's no way that Teddy wil!Jive in to 
Jimmy. Not after going this far. lbere's a 
family name at .~e. 

But Jerry wiD have nothing to loR. Nineteen-
eighty i. just the launching point for his 
presidential aspirations. Thi. year he may 
sUpply be content to a.k hi. delegates to vote 
for him on the Ii,. ""Iotandilhen ... , ... fer. 

.compromise candidate 01 Brown'. choice. 
What a coup! With Brown'. delegates volinll 

for a ' compromise candidate, Jimmy and 
, Teddy'. delegates will have to reconsider _ After 
all, here will be their chance to draft a 
candidate, the fint draft in over ax yean. And 
in this way the deI~ates won't have to vote for 
either Jimmy or Teddy. That'. the lFeatest 
incentive. 

And California will be proud 01 ita nalive 1011, 
who will be courageous and patriotic enouch to 
lead his party out of the frying pan and into the 
general election_. . 

Of . coune, there ' wiD remain the moor 
difficulty of choosina a compromiee candidate. 
It would have to be ~ we've aD heard of 
before. Perhaps someone who has lead a 
campaign in the put. Someone leu lileral than 
Kennedy and yet someone a Kennedyclelegate 
could a~ve of. Maybe someone with some 
of Carter • ideas but who doesn't amie quite .a 
much. 

Perhaps if we dip into the candidate pool of 
1972 and 1976 we may come up with some

General Assembly 
To Condemn Soviets 

UNJT~D NATIONS - The UN Security Council, 
blocked from acting on its own because of a So-viet veto, sent to 
the General Assembly its stalled proposal to pressure the Soviet 
Union into withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan. 

The Council voted 12·2 with one abstention on Wednesday to 
call the Ceneral Assembly into emergency session. 

The debate was to begin late this afternoon and is expected to 
end Saturday or Sunday with adoption of the resolution. 

Mexico and the Philippines introduced the ioinbProoosal for 
an emer,gency seSSIOn, the sixth in the assem Iy's 34-year 
history. The Soviet Union and its ally East Germany voted 
against the resolution, while Zambia abstained . 

The Soviet Union strongly opposed the new debate, 
maintaining that it constituted illegal interference in 
Afghanistan's internal affairs. 

China and the United States, Soviet Ambassador Oleg 
Troyanovsky charged, wanted to drag this nonexistent 
question" before the General Assembly in order to carry out 
their imperialist and hegemonistic plans and to renew the cold 

" war. 
" There is no doubt at all that we are confronting an invasion, 

an armed intervention," Mexican Foreign Minister Jorge 
Castaneda told the council. " We are in danger of falling into a 
cold war." 

Before the meeting, Pakistan's Ambassador Niaz Naik said 
the Soviets now had 85,000 men spread all over Afghanistan, 
some within 20 miles of his country's border. .

China Backs 
Up on Statement 

PEKING (UPI) - The 
official Chinese news agency 
said yesterday Vice Premier 
Deng Xiaoping's call for "an 
alliance" of all countries to 
"counter" Soviet power was a 
mistranslation. 

The news agency Xinhua 
issued a correction saying it 
should have used the words 
"unite" instead of "alliance," 
and "deal seriously with" 
instead of "counter." 

The charges considerably 
softened Deng's proposal.

Those are some of the 

conclusions reached by an 
extensive study of freshman 
attitudes scheduled for release 
today by OASIS, the Office of 
Academic Support and

The survey was conducted 
as part of a systemwide survey 
to determine the effectiveness 
of campus services and the 
satisfaction of students, 
particularly from minority 
groups, with their campus 
performance and adjustment.

About one· fifth less

<tbout a tenth less non·EOP

then' were large increases in

HOUling and Income 

An OASIS survey just released 
aske~ incoming freshman from the 
year 1977 -7 8 what they tho,?ght

(above left), least favorite (above 
right) and how well ther were 
prepared for high schoo were 
amonR dozens' of questions asked 

But college breaks students 
away from their families. 

Only SIX percent of 
freshmen polled said family 
was the greaaest factor in 
helping them adjust to 
university life. 

Most of the survey respondants (57 percent) lived 
on campus, with a majority of the rest (22 percent) 
living with parents or relatives. 

T wo·thirds lived on campus or within five miles of 
UCSD, while 10 percent lived over 20 miles away 
(usually near the border or up the coast). 

Slightly over one·third (35 percent) worked at 
least~rt-time , most of them under 20 hours a week. 

EOP, SAA and SA students worked fewer hours 
per week, but a higher percentage of EOP students 
actually had job than did non·EOP students. 

55 percent of employed students worked off 
campus. 

Included with UCSO's survey was a systemwide 
survey of EOP/SAA/SA students which showed 
that over twice as many EOP students receive 
financial aid as do non·EOP students; 70 percent to 

About a fifth thought the variety of course 
offerings was the best new thing about college, but 
when asked to name their worst experience as a 
freshman , a fifth said academic pressure. 

Another 14 percent said a particularly bad class 
was their worst experience. 

Only 10 percent thought that university red tape 
was the hardest part about attending UCSD as a 
freshman. . 

Campus services were given a solid endorsement 
by both EOP and non·EOP students. 

92 percent of each were satisfied with the libraries, 
about 80 percent of each with living arrangements, 
campus entertainment, friendliness of the students 
and opportunities to participate in ethnic and cultural 
events. 

75 percent were satisfied with classroom

Atty. Rick Elliott disagrees. 

"The students were warned in those letters (the 
newsletter sent by the Resident Dean's office) 
that there was a strong possibility of other visitors 
in the dorms besides Santa Claus. There were 
other materials of the same nature sent to the 
students by the campus police and so on ... the

Interest in China Sparks Department 
By Taylor E;. Dark 

More than twice al many 
.tude... are studying the 
Chinese language at UCSD 
this year al la.t, and largely 
because of increased pub~city 
about China and its culture, 
according to Ping Hu, 
Director of the Chinese 
language program here. 

La.t year 25 students took 
Chinele . This year 55 
• tudents ~re Itudying the 
language, requiring a new 
Teaching Auistant for the 
program. 

"Many of the students have 
had their curiosity sparked by 

the recent developmentl (in 
US· China relations)," says 
Willard CaddeU, a Chinese 
and management science 
double major. 
Caddell said he is taking 
Chinese primarily out of 
interest, but hopes that with 
increased trade with China he 
wiH also find an economic use 
for his .kill. 

" A sampling of the students 
are taking it for prolpective 
economic reasons:' CaddeU 
saYI. 

About ~.fifth of the 
students in the progrllm are of 
Chinese delCent, but' are 

taking it because they either do 
not .peak it at aD, can only 
apeak but not read or write, or 
lpeak an uncommon dialect, 
according to Hu. 

Patrick Loo, another 
student in the program, says 
he, is .tudying the language 

~ause he feel. "it'. part of 
being Chineee" and because 
he has fell a "sense of 
embarraurnenf' at his home 
. in San F rancilco .:aotlmowing 
the language that is cpmmonly 
used IlJnOn8 the city'. large 
Chinese popuIalion. . 

Hu delCribel her students 
as "very internted"in Chinese 

and sayl tbe program "is 
becoming better and better." 
Student. are taught at 
beginning, intermediate and 
advanced levels and the 
program is open to new 
.tudents only during the Fall 
1uarter. 

Hu is originally from 
Taiwan, where she warked at 
a radio and televilion "'Iion, 
She came to the United Statea 
in 1966 and received her 
master's degree two years 
later. She hal been teac:fUnc at 
UCSD since 1978. 

New Housing Coming 
Continued from pallft 1 
until the new haUling is built on campua . 

Even if the university i. unsucce.sful in its appeal •• which 
McElroy said he believes wiD be the case .. the owner must 
allow 18 months before evicting the tenants. 

"So if the council decide I to approve the convenion, the 
tenants wiU have plenty of time to find a new place," he said. 

Brown Proposes Taking Oil Fund Away From Schools 
Continued from txJIle 1 
Saxon suggested that a $150 mimon 
line of credit be e.tablished in the 
1980-81 budget from which all three 
higher education systems which 
finance their capital outlay project. 
Only then did he propose turning over 
the balance to whatever programs the 
stale felt were necessary. 

By way of explaining the governor's 
slashing of the unive,sity's proposal 
from $150 million to the -governor's 
proposed $ 77 miUion for 1980.8 I, a 
spokesman for the finance department 
QC>inted out that only $47 .million of 
The $195 million available for the fund 
was used by the three systems of higher 
education thi. fiscal year. 

Of that $47 million, UC'. requested 
$25.8 mimon of these funds and was 
appropriated only $14.7 million by the 

1~tP.slature. . . 
'These figures should be put m thell' 

proper perspective," said Sara MoIla, 
the spokeswoman for Saxon. "The 
department of finance forecast lalt 
year that only $40 million was 
expected in 1979.80 from the tideland 

oil' fund,· and we· were .. ked to scale 
down our request accordingly." 

for 1980-81 UC tau requested 
$29.9 million for ca ... .at outlay and 
$2.2 million for the Drew proiec:t from 
the fund.

from San Diego Statt:'s 1973

Seventeen players have 
been working out some three

weeks in preparation for an 
ambitious UCSD schedule 
which includes two matches 
with UCLA, two with the 
University of Haw~ and an 
AU·Cal tournament which 
boasts three NCAA Division I

tough schedule to bring out the 
be.t in his players, . 

"We won't be playing East

newcomer Jim Dooley, from 
Anchorage, Alaska provides 
Dannevik with a strong middJe 
blocker. Bob Rhodes, another 
All-League player last year, is 
also expected to play a vital 
role in the Triton's success in 
the other middle blocker 
poaition. 

' Hal Jacobs will start in the 
quickhitter slot. Eric Willi., a 
third year player, and junior 
Jon Mooney give the Triton , 
the needed quickness from the

coach Dannevik expects the 
bench to contribute heavily to 
the team's performance. 

"TIle subs are right behind 
the .tarlen," say. Dannevik, 
The hitter poaition is reaDy

Despite the cloaeness in 
talent between the .tarters and 

the substitutes team morale 
remains sky high, anticipating

January 11, 1980 The Dally Guardian 

Gleanings From the 1979 Turntable 
By Ted Burke 

Arts Editor 
After a modicum of 

meditation, soul-searching, 
and late-night phone calls, I've 
decided that this annual 
autopsy we call a "year-in-
review" won't be as grisly as I 
imagined. In fact, the most 
outlandish generalization one 
could make about the state of 

handed and strains too often 
for effect (too much piano, 
echo chambers, an overkill of 
vocal over dubs), Costello 
remains a formidable talent 
that no amount of cheap 
granish can obscure. At best, 
(more times than not) Costello 
is dead on target. At worst, 
he's utterly incoherent and 
artlessly paranoid. 

Armed Forces: Costello remains A 
Formidable talent that no amount of 
cheap garnish can obsure. 

2) Nice Guys - The Art 
Ensemble of Chicago (ECM): 
By definition, avant-garde or 
"free" jazz is supposed to be 
dillicult for the uniniated to 
warm up to , but the 
Ensemble 's latest seems (to 
me at least) to be the one '79 
release in the genre that even 
Mangione fans can find 

3) Trevor Rabin - rrevor 
Rabin (Chrysalsis) Rabin is a 
singer-songwriter-guitarist 
from South Africa who's 
same·named debut album 
supplies the kind of mega-rock 
that Todd Rundgren's been 
promising for years. Rabin 
proceeds through a far·fetched 
array of styles, from 
Mountainesque heavy-metal, 
syrupy ballads, Mclaughlin. 
inspired jazz.rock, Zappa-like 
ensemble virtuosity, through 
disco and reggae, olten 
blending these incongruous 
strands into the same song. 
And, incredibly, it works. 

4) Van Halen II . (Warner 
Brothers) : Edward Van Halen 
plays flashy hard rock guitar 
with admirable vengeance and 
ingenuity, that is enough for 
me. 

5) One of a Kind - Bill 
Bruford (Polydor) : The fonner 
Yes . King Crimson and 
Genems drummer deftly leads 

pop music in 1979 is that it 
was merely "okay." As in any 
year, there were plenty of 
decent albums that passed 
through my hands on to mine 
and my writer's turntable, but 
there was a sizable proportion 
of discs from new and 
established artists that fall 
well·below what one wants to 
hear . Inany case, rock and roll 
doesn't seem to be dying at the 
present moment, though 1,Iike 
anyone else who 's been 
involved with the stuff too 
much for their own good, 
would have to have heard 
more records that reached the 
highwater mark. What follows 
;Ire my annual hit-and-run 
comments on the previous 
year's more or less notable 
releases . 

Rust Never ' Sleeps: 
released a masterpiece 
rock and roll testament. 

YOU[1g has 
of a kind, a 

Best Records of '79 
1) Armed Forces • Elvis 

Costello (Columbia): 
Although Nick Lowe's 
production is at times heavy· 

enjoyable. Nice Guys is a 
brilliant crazy quilt of styles 
and strategies, with the shifting 
textures and colorations of 
saxophones, trumpets, drums, 
bass, and a plethora of more 
obscure instruments proceed-
ing through a fascinating 
session of unconventional 
improvisation. 

a band of superb musIcians 
through a session that. 
c ombines the best of 
progressive rock (composi-
tional organization with a rich 
sense of harmony and 
counterpoint) and the best of 
fusion rock (inventive soloing 
meshing hard-rock dynamics

10 The Daily Guardian January 1 1, 1980 

Year on Platter: Mitchell Disappointing 
Continued from page 9 
with fleet-filliered technique). 
Guitarist Allan Holdsworth 
performs as though in a state 
01 grace, and bassist :Jeff 
Berlin is someone to watch out 
for. 

6) ShinlJ Beast (Bat Pull 
Chain) - Captain Beefheart 
and the Magic Band (Warner 
Brothen): Seefheart, rock's 
most idiosyncratic avant-
garde individualist, is 
rdreahingly in place for once, 
teeming to have hammered 
his worrisome kinks and quirks 
into a form that benefits his 
talent for constructing 
fractured, asymmetrical, 
dada-derived music. Splendid 

Iggy has influenced. Iggy 
proves here that he is the main-
man. 

8) Fear of Music · Talking 
Heads (Sire): Talking Heads, 
I fear . is more of an alliance 
with art·rockers like Eno, 
Roxy Music and John Cale 
than Mth the New 
Wave, but that hasn 't stopped 
me from liking them. Their 
music has a cleverly controlled 
graininess that puts them half-
way between garage band 
amateurism and the post-
twelve tone rigors of the "new 
music" conceptualists. David 
Byrne's lyrics, sung in a voice 
that sounds as though it might 

Mingus.Joni Mitchell has little 
justification to be futzing around with 
The moody expressionism of jazz. 
use of free jazz tonalities, 
urban blues, Carribean 
rhythms, and rhythm and 
blues. . 

7) New Value$ - I(gy Pop: 
Iggy, who i. the godfather of 
punk if anyone is, hal finally 
transcended the problems 
that've too often .topped him 
from delivering that all· 
pI8'pC)ee knockout punch. The 
muIic: i. crunchy. cantanker-
ous rock and roU, Iggy's 
vocals have the appeal of the 
oH-hand remark, and the lyrics 
succeed in being anti-
intenectual without the 
obnoxious posturing that i. the 
calling card of many whom 

evaporate at any moment, 
expresses the tortured holistics 
of the paranoid mind while 
alloMng 8. ~ttIe self-
pity a. possible. This i. the 
work of a refreshingly 
straightforward sociopath. 

9) Rust Never Sleeps - Neil 
Young (Warner Brothers): 
Young, who, like Norman 
Mailer, hal' been producing 
advertisements for himself for 
years to ~ttle advantage (self-
revelation must attain the ' 
universal, not the therapeutic, 
if it's to sit well as something 
I'd like to investigate), has 
released a masterpiece of a 
kind, a rock and roll testament 

that deals with American 
icons, institutionalized 
violerice, and the sand-trap of 
self ·Iove (among other 
themes). And Crazy Horse 
helps Young play some of the 
dirtiest rock and roll of the 
year. 

10) Squeezing Out SfJark. 
Graham Parker' Parker bites 
the hFad off of everyone who's 
ever done him dirt with mll~ic 
and Ivrics that have (he 
mainstream kick of the old 
Rolling Stont!s. Hlunt , 
uncompromising stuff. 

Most Disapt>ointing Records 
of the Year 

1) Mingus . Joni Mitchell 
(Asylum): I've nothing against 
an established artist trying to 
break away from the stuff 
they've already done so that 
they might "advance their 
art," but I protest against arlay 
experi~nts in areas where a 
particular artist has no 
business being. To be specific. 
Joni Mitchell has little 
justification to be futzing 
around with the moody 
expressionism of jazz, as she 
does on MinglU. Though the 
music and lyrics jell better this 
time than on her previous Don 
Juan '5 ReckleSll Daughter (a 
bottomless pit d amorphous 
atona~sm and free-associative 
lyrics that expressed the 
forgettable in terms of the 
incomprehensible), Mitchell's 
primary problem on Mingus is 
that she 's not much of a jazz 
singer. Her voice sounds thin 

and attenuated when it should 
sound alive, brassy, and full· 
bodied, pallid when it should 
ha ve color . You find yourself 
longing for Annie Ross, or 
Patti Waters . And as a tribute 
to the late Charlie Mingus, thi s 
record doesn't quite wash. 'fhe 
bits of dialogue between 
songs, featuring Mingus 

reminiscing Mth the musicians 
and ever pondering his own 
death, don't give the album 
any more depth than what the 
music - s~me it it quite good, 
most of It half·baked -
already supp~es. It smacks c! 
tackiness. 

2) Flag - James Taylor 
(Columbia): I've defended 
Taylor for rears against those 
who'd cal him an overly 
sensitive pansy, but with Flag 
even I have to admit that my 
main-man folkie has drawn a 
blank. This is soft·rock 
sentimentality at its most ' 
jformulamatic and insuffer· 
ably insipid . 

3)Manifesto . Roxy Music 
(Atlantic): Music has always 
made it a point to sound effete 
and arch, so I don't suppose it 
makes much sense to 
complain about Manifesto's 
line of set poses - betrayed 
romanticism, spenglarian 
decadence, the Decline of the 
We.t. This time, though, the 
songs ,don't connect Mth· the 
gut as much as they do with 
the intellect. And what I liked 
about them was that they were 
a first-rock band who were 
capable of bridging the mind-
body split. 

4) Exposure· Robert Fripp 
(Columbia): In recent 
interviews the brains behind 
King Crimson has shown that 
he suffers from logorrhea 
rather than being the possesser 
of a first-rate mind , and on 
Exposure Fripp demonstrates 
that his great experiments are 
just dandyistic and show 
pieces that are no more 
compelling than a night at 
I JCSD's own Atomic Cafe. 

5) Lodger - David Bowie 
(RCA): This guy should take a 
rest. 

6) Tusk: fleetwOOd Mac 
(Warner Brothers): There are 
some nice tunes from both 
Lindsay Buckingham and 
Stevie Nicks, but the use of 
sound·effects and off the wall 

. instrumentation don't make 
this another White Album. 

7) Lennox Avenue 
Breakdown (Columbia) . 
Arthur Blythe: Bland is the 
word . ' 

8) I'm The Man - Joe 
Jackson: Oh, shut up. 

9) Slow Train Coming . 
Bob Dylan (Columbia): Praise 
the Lord and fork over my 
royalty check. 

10) Communique • Dire 
Straits (Warner Brothers): 
Mark Knopfler is, we know, a 
good lyricist and a better 
guitar player, but his voice, 
with all its Dylan cum Lou 
Reed qualities, isn't 
consistently interesting to 
listen to, and his melodies, 
taken as a whole, and as 
appealing as a biology text.
