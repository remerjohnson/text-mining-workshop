That Time Again-
AS Elections Are 
Fast Approaching 

By RAYDELE ARCHIVAL 
Staff Writer 

For the majority of student 'I . spring 
break was a time to forget about schoul, to 
take it easy and have some fun . But for 
other students, it was a time to get busy 
at work preparing for the upcoming 
Associated Student (AS) election on April 
] 9th and 20th. 

The filing period for candidacy in the 
AS election began Feb. 28th and ends 
Wednesday, April 6th whereupon all 
candidates are required to attend a 
Mandatory Candidate's Meeting that 
evening at 5:00 in the North Conference 
Room. The meeting will be conducted by 
Elections Commissioner, Catherine 
EIchhorn and AS advisor. Randy 
Woodard. 

According to the 1983-84 AS Election 
Codes, the purpose of the Candidate's 
Meeting is "to hold a drawing which shall 
determine the order of names as they will 
appear on the ballot, to clarify what the 
pertinent dates and regulations 
concerning the elections are and to 
answer any questions the candidates 
might have." 

Although the number of students who 
have filed up to this date i not great. 
Eichhorn explained that many students 
make their major decisions concerning 
the elections over spring break. 

"They use the time to figure out their 
campaign strategy, what office to apply 
for, what platform torun from and how to 
run their campaign." 

Eichhorn added that although she will 
not know how many students have filed 
until the third day of spring quarter, she 
believes that the applicant turnout will be 
high. 

"I know a lot of students who plan to 
run. however I do not have an official 
9Ount. Many students are just waiting 
until the last day," said Eichhorn. 

Students who wish to file for candidacy 
must go through a four step filing 
process. Each cadidate must first 
complete an Eligibility Form in triplicate. 
He/ She must be an enrolled full-time 
undergraduate student , ha ve and 
maintain at least a 2.0 overall GPA, meet 
requirements of the desired position as 
sta ted in the ASUCSD Constitution and 
attend the Mandatory Candidate's 
Meeting. A student may only fi le for one 
office per election. 

In addition to these requirements. AS 
President Henry Chu explained that a 
candidate must have inner characteris-
tics as well that may qualify himlher for 
the job. 

"The most important trait a candidate 
can have is a willingness to spend time 
working with issues and his/ her fellow 
cabinet members. A st udent may have a 
fu 11 schedule. an outside job and ot her 
extracuricular activities. yet he/ she IS 
committed to the AS and must therefore 
make the time. r would be looking very 
carefull y for that."

.... '- , /( ''-----") ~ 
"The candidate must also be able to 

communicate well with a diver enumber 
of people and have a good sense of 
economic and financial background. We 
work with a quarter of a million dollars 
and a AS member must know how to 
research a project thoroughly before a 
decision can be made on whether the AS 
should finance it, " Chu stated. 

He added, "The largest responsibility a 
candidate has is that he/she is becoming 
an official representative of the students. 
Each nominee must have a clear idea of 
what the mainstream student is like and 
what he wants." 

Once the Eligibility Form is completed. 
it is submitted to the A Advisor's Office 
in order to receive a Candidate 
Endorsement Petition. The number of 
signatures vary. depending upon the 
office a student files for. Presidential 
candidates mu·t submIt 100 signatures, 
and college representatives must obtam 
50 signatures. All signatures must be 
accompaned by student LD numbers. 

When the Petition is submitted. the 
candidate then picks up a ~ late 
Authorization Sheet which lists all the 
candidates who will appear under the 
same slate, and Campaign Income 
Expense Record which itemizes the 
amount of money a candidate has spent 

The AS has always had a slate rule. 
According to hu, the only difference 

now is that the slate name will appear on 
the ballot. 

"A person can vote for a candidate 
through the slate name. Before. the 
students just voted through indiVIdual 
names. They did not know \\'ho the 
candidates \\:ere aSSOCiated with or what 
platform they ,-<upported. Now they do. " 
said Chu. 

Eichhorn pointed out thead\3ntagesof 
the slate rule. claiming it can lead to a 
stronger government. 

"There will not be so many indl\' iduab 
WIth different Ideas . Instead the 
mdividuals support a particular platform 
and they share common mterests. The\' 
agree on specific Is:-.ues," she explained-. 

Perhaps the most Important aspect of 
the electlOn IS the campalgnll1g whICh 
begins 12 noon. Apnl 7th and ends at 
closing of the polls on April 20th . All 
candidates are responsible for comp/) mg

In Favor of a

open-armed 
acceptance and 
bitter hatred 

~ome people have "uggested 
that California, like its sister· 
staleh, start II', own state·run 
100lery. This Idea has been mel 
\\ it h' bo tho pen · arm ed 
acceptance and bItter hatred . I 
thIn k a slate·run lot tcry would 
be one of t he best t h i ng~ for 
California. It \\ould help solve 
the gamblIng problem. as well 
as provide a large financial 
base for t he opera I ion of 
Cali fornia 's many ..,ervices. 

First. consider that 
gambling ha::, been ",ith 
mankind o"er the centuries. 
Try as we might , we ha"e not 
managed to elim1l1ate it from 
our culture . There will be 
gambhng in \ arious forms 
f rom horse racing to card 
playing. Since we can't 
eliminate gambling all 
togelhcr, we might as well tax 
the winnings of those who 
choosc to gamble. Taxing the 
gambler 's winnings is not to 
dl'>courage gambling because 
of moral resons. rather, It is to 
pr()\ide the state with 
addlt ional rc\ enu e . The 
mone) mIght a.... well do 
someone else some good. 

Furt hermort" In a system 
.... uch as a state-run lot ten. the 
amount of re\'enue gene'rated 
far exceeds the CO!'lt of 
operating the lottery. To be 
specific, if tickets were sold at 
$3.00 and ten pril'es were 
awarded to t he lucky WIn ners 
(each receiVIng one mi ll ion), 
Cahfornia wou ld require that 
on ly 1.5 percent of the 
document ed IXJ I-lula l!on buy 
t icket ... to r eco u p its 
ill\e>.t ment. If 75 percent of 
the populat ion bought tickets, 
Cali fo rnia would gain a net 
profit of over $650 million. The 
ten mi lhon dolla rs could then 
IX' considered taxa ble income. 

Wh Ile some people oppose a 
state-run lottery bccau~(' they 
reel that thl~ would inV ite

place. Finally, one cannot deny 
that gambling would gIVe 
Ca l ifornia that added 
ad\'antage of holding money in 
t he state. 

When Nevada legalIzed 
gambling in Las Vegas, 
:'>Je\adam; realized all of the 
beneflb. Many people in 
:'>Je\'ada, Oregon, and Ca lifor-
nia flocked over the border into 
t\evada to spend their hard-
earned money in ca~inos and 
other \' arious gamb ling 
devices. Nevada has reaiIl.ed 
that gambling brings large 
profits. Nevada has such a 
large tax base that t hey have 
found that sales tax i!'ln't

Letters to the Editor Cheating, Copying 
Scholarships Offered for Bible Criticism PlagiariB~.rJ;ti~EtPCSD 

,,>taft Wrater 

Editor: 
Refreshing! Different!! No 

holds barred!!! At last, a 
chance to challenge t he "Good 
Book" and the Mora l Majority 
mentality - an invitation for 
college student s to critique, 
obj ectively, the contents of the 
Bible. 

The Freedom From Religion 
Foundat ion is sponsoring its 
fi fth annual essay contest for 
college students who are asked 
to write about such things as 
"Vulgaritie in the Scrip-
tures," and "How the Bible 
Negates the US Constitution." 

"Last year we asked 
students to wrile about why 
a nd how th ey rejected 
religion," said Anne Gay lor, 
Foundation president. "But 
this year, si nce it's either 
'Year of the Bible' or 'NON-
Year of the Bible: we thought 
Bible criticism would be a 
natura l. " 

The Foundation is asserting 
that a law passed by Congress 
declaring 1983 to be 'Year of 
t he Bible' is an unconstitu· 
tional law, a violation of state-
church separation since it 
singles out one religion and 

one religion's book 111 deflanCl' 
of the First Amendment. 

Students may write about 
any area of Bible CritiCIsm, for 
example: Cruelties 111 the 
BIble, Treatment of Women 111 
the Bible, Bible AbsurditIes, 
Biblical Parallels with Legend, 
A Comparison of the Bible 
with other 'Holy' Book.."

Perhaps the greatest social 
re ponsibility of our sorority is 
friendship. At a university 
where it is often hard to meet 
other people, and to make 
friends, our sorority offers 

sisterhood and the format ion 
of bonds between ourselves 
and our college which help u 
to work together to make 
ourselve and our school ju t a 
little bit better academically, 
socially. and intellectually.

such sen Ice~ as libraries 
(which used to be open six days 
a week). school field trips, 
textbooks, summer camps, 
jobs programs and other 
services too numerous to be 
menl ioned here, came from 
property taxes . When the 
source of lhese funds was 
remo\'ed, or at least drastically 
cut back , the ci t ies had a bit ter 
choice to make: either cut 
servICes or raise taxes/ charge 
"user" fees . Taxes 'ertainly 
wouldn't be good for the 
govern ment, hence services 
were cut to the minimum and 
user fees were charged. If a 
lottery syslem were intro-
duced, as much as $650 
million, possibly more. could 
be intn){luced into the state 

budget. This could conceiva·

million) which could be used in

s ince, theoret ically, the lottery 
would run each year, the fund 
would be continuously 
replenished). Why then, if the 
lottery has so much going for 
it, don't we have one now? 

There a re some very sl rong 
groups in California that don't 
want a state lottery system. 
To name the IwO mosl famous 
groups: the naltonal horse 
racing association and the 
"1110ral majority" groups. The 
horse racing association 
doesn'l wan t a lottery because 
people would much rather 
gamble b\ mail Ihan go down 
to the local rare track (which, 

In I Ill' opinIOn of man> Ix.~)pll' ,

The lott ery idea IS up for 
debate now and from the 
evidence obtained, it can be 
seen t hat it would be an 
excell ent investment for 
Cahfornia. It appears to be the 
solution to our budget 
problems, and except for a few 
~e l ect groups, it appears to 
sat isf y most people. Isn't it 
tlille \\e take an example from 
our O{'ighbors and solve the 
budget problem once and for 
a II? "You aren 't supposed to sleep 

well, of course; you're in 
danger supposedly." 

That kind of specious logic 
gets very old, very quickly. It is 
all too easy for anyone to read 
into evolution all the meaning 
he or she wishes to; actually, 
most trait are not so easily 
described (In fact, most alleged 
"point-traits" are not even 
easily deduced by humans, 
period.), and many meanings 
read Into evolution are more 
representative of Wishful 
thinking than of an actual 
description of reahty . Many 
such beha\ iars Just aren't that 
conveniently linked; one's 
gastrointestinal I ract "wants 

to empty out" simply because 
of local hormonal fluctuations 
due to epinephrine accumula-
tion - not because any 
primate ancestors evolved the 
meritorious capacity of 
"mobile-pooping." Similarly, 
we don't get headaches 
because we unconsciously 
practice threat displays while 
we're studying, but because 
we inadvertently allow 
tension to build up in muscles 
anywhere throughout th body, 
and insomnia did not evolve as 
a part of the human condition 
for any purpose, but exists 
because we continually feed 
our epinephrine pools by 
pointless worrying.

Ruling in 
Minnesota 
Against 
Solomon 
Amendment Unconstitutional 

By MITCH SOSNA 
SCali Writer 

On March 9, 1983, 111 St. 
Paul. Minne ota, Federal 
Judge Donald D. Al -op found 
that the Solomon Amendment 
is unconstitutional and 
granted a preliminary 
injunction that has temporar· 
ily enjoined the Selective 
Service System and the 
Department of Education from 
enforcing the law. 

The Solomon Amendment, 
an amendment to the Military 
Selective Service Act, was 
approved by Congres last 
year. 

The measure. introduced by 
Rep. Gerald Solomon (R-NY) in 
the House and Senator S.1. 
Hayakawa (R·CA) in the 
Senate, provided that anyone 
required to register for the 
draft would be required to do 
so before becoming eligible for 
any form of financial 
assistance under Title IV of 
the Higher Education Act of 
1965. Title IV covers all forms 
of federal financial assi tance. 

On September 8, 1982, 
President Reagan signed the 
measure into law <public Law 
97-252}. On November ~3, 
1982, the Minnesdta Public 
Interest Research Group (M-
Pirg), as well as the Minne. ota 
chapter of the American Civil 
Liberties Union, brought suit 
challenging the law. 

According to the American 
Student Association, the 
intent of M-Pirg's suit wa to 
have the law declared 
unconstitutional and enjoin 
the federal government from 
either enforcing the law or 
issuing regulations for the 
implementation of the law. 

In ciling several rea ons for 
unconstitutionality, M-Pirg 
claimed that PL 97-252 
constituted a Bill of Attainder 
and contended t hat the law 
also infringed on a st udent 's 
right against self·incrimina-
tion under the Fifth

By CRAIG KAKUDA

After reading The Chronicle 
of Higher Education 's survey 
on rising co~ts of college 
tuition and fees , AS PreSident 
Henry Chu posed a very 
<>erious queslion: "Are we 
really committed towards 
education for all?" 

Based on the Chronicle's 
su rvey of 150 pu blic and 150 
private institutions, the 
average total student cost 
(including tuition and fees, 
room and board, books and 
supplies, tran portation, and 
personal expen~es) of 
attending a four-year public 
IOstitution was $3,720 for the 
1982-83 academic year, up 6.8 
percenl from last yea r' s 
average. 

The projection for the next 
yea r' s average cost is $3,955, 
up 6.3 percent. and $4,221 for

Rec Facility Delays 
Pay Off for Students 

By JEFf SAVAGE

A $12 refund is being issued 
to all UC 0 studenls 
registering for the Spring

The opening day projection 
of the new UCSD Recrealional

its March 5th goal, due. 111 a 
large part, to constructIOn 
dela ys resultll1g from the 
inclement weather experl'

last two months. 

The Rec Facility is located 
just north of Warren field and 
will house an OlympIC size 50 
meter pool, five racquet ball 
courts, a temporary weight

The ne .... opening date

unjustified for 'them to begin

Magnetic Research on Campus 
continued from page 5 

Three million dollars of the 
industry contributions will be 
used to build a 23,500 square 
foot building, which is to be 
located east of Central Library 

Industry funds will also 
provide for four endowed 
chairs, equipment for 
laboratories, research support , 
and national meetings. 

Presently a search is 
underway for the faculty 
whose research interests are 
in magnetic recording. In 
addition to their basic salary 
support, each faculty chair 
will receive an endowment 
income of $250,000 to support 
research and graduate student 
stipends. 

Eventually, the center will 
house eight faculty, including 
the director, 40 graduate 
students, visiting faculty, and 
other professional research· 
ers, and four support staff. 
Faculty members associated 
with the center will offer 
courses that relate to magnetic 
recording through their 
respective departments on 
both the graduate and 
undergraduate level. 

The areas of research that 
will be addressed include the 
study of the micromagnetics of 
thin magnetic films and 
magnetic particle ensembles 
and integration of magnetic 
and semiconductor compo· 
nents, especially in low signal 
to noise applications. 

Because magnetic recording 
is broadly based on many 
scientific di sciplines , t he 
center 's purpose is to faci litate 
interdisci pli nary activity. 

At U CSD th e r e ar e 
professors in the departments 
of Chemis try , EECS, a nd 
Physics whose interests have 
s ignifi cant rel e van ce to 
magnetic recording research, 
including the popular 
chemistry professor, Hans 
Oesterreicher. He is well 
known for his work on the 
chemical and magnetic 
properties of rare earth 
magnetic compounds, espe· 
ciaJly super conductivity 
compounds. 

Magnetic recording re-
search is crucial to the growth 
in the technology of mass data 
storage. 

Many UCSD students make 
use of "floppy disks" in their 
computer sCience classes to 
magnetically store their 
computer programs . The 
floppy disk is just one result of 
magnetic recording research, 
and it is a rather primitive 
example. 

The new Center for 
Magnetic Recording Research 
will carry out work that will 
move far beyond floppy disks 
and magnetic tape . By 
bringing together chemists, 
computer scientists, and 
physicist s, new physical · 
chemical compounds can be 
developed whose magnetic 
properties ensure the 
maximum information 
storage capacity in a minimum 
space for a maximum storage 
life. 

The IBM Magnetic Record· 
ing Institute in San Jose has 
made available Dr. Albert S. 
Hoagland to assis t in the 
establi shm ent of UC SD 's 
Center for Magnetic Recording 

Research. 
" People g e tting int o 

pe r onal computers ca n 
empathize with the imporl-
ance of data storage, " said 
Hoagland . "IBM has recently 
come out with a 100megabyte 
disk for its personal computer. 
You wouldn 't have to go back 
more than two or three years 
to find that people couldn't 
conc<!ive of that kind of 

capabili~y for a small 
computer. 

Shipments of magnetic 
recording products exceed $20 
bi!lion annually. UCSD's 
proximity to a rapidly growing 
center of the electronics 
industry immediately north of 
cam pus in Sorrento Valley will 
place UCSD in a good position 
to work with the private sector 
in becoming a leader in 
magnetic recording research. 

Currently, Japan is the only 
country where academic 
research in magnetic 
recording is supported and 
fostered. Nearly a dozen 
Japanese universities are 
carrying out research in this 
field, and this accounts for 
their strong position in this 
area of electronics. 

The new center at UCSD 
will be the first university 
institution of its kind in the 
United States, and UCSD's 
repu ta tion for excellence 
bodes well for its future 
development. 

"We hope to become one of 
the key centers of the world for 
the training of people who will 
be in the forefront of 
developments in the magnetic 
reco rding fie ld ," s aid 
Chancellor Atkinson .

for the student s' Fall quarter

Kobayashi was quick to 
credit Vice Chancellor 
Watson's decision, saying "It 
is nice that Watson thought

Kobayashi has been 
presented with a number of 
options. One is the possibility 
of delaying the opening date of 
the Rec Center until 90 days 
prior to the Fall quarter fee 
payment date, thereby 
allowing the first loan 
payment to be on time. This 
would extend the opening date 
beyond the 1982-83 school year 
and into the summer. 

Another option is a 
community fund of $150,000 
available to Kobayashi as a 
result of his involvement with 
the San Diego Aquatics 
Association . This source is 
definite but Kobayashi would 
prefer to avoid it if possible. 

Still another option is 
simply an extension from 
Wells Fargo on the first 
payment date of the loan. 
Simple, but unrealis tic. 

Kobayashi 's problems do 
not end there. The same $12 
charge has already been 
collected from all UCSD staff 
and faculty w ho pay a Rec 

charge on a year to year basis. 
In s tead of hav ing to rein burse 
th em, Kobayashi hopes to 
resolve the matter by s imply 
i suing them credi t. 

Kobayas hi reali zes the 
s tudent 's pos ition but does not 
quite agree with the s ituation 
as it stands, saying, "The 
concern is over the fact that 
the graduating seniors won't 
get another chance to use (the 
facility). But we're only 
talking about twelve bucks 
here. I think that is a nice 
contribution for them to leave, 
but then again, money is 
money." 

GoodNews 
The Center for Disease 

Control in Atlant a has nearly 
succeeded in its ca mpa ign to 
eradicate measles from the 
United States. 

They bega n immun iz ing

Now 96 percent of American 
school children are vaccinated

attending a private fouf·year 
insti tution for the current 
) 982-83 academ ic yea r IS 
$7,382, up 11.9 percent. For 
1983-84, the average costs are 
projected at $8,077, up 9.4 
percent. and $8.150 for 1984· 
85, up 8.4 percent. 

On-campus UCSD students 
are payi ng a pproxima te l y 
$5,751.50 per year. By next 
year, wi th the possibility of 
ad d itional fees, UCSD 
students cou ld be paying well 
over $6,000. 

UCSD's Director of 
Fi nancial Se r vices. Tom 
Rutter, who must contend 
with budget cut backs, a steady 
erosion of fi nancial aid 
funding, and a lack of concern 
for student aid among many 
government officia ls, feels 
that steadily increasing 
col lege costs could ve ry 
po sibly shut the doors to 
higher education for many 
potent ia l students. 

"The problem is tha t costs 
go up wit h on ly a sligh t 
increase in fu nd ing," said 
Rutter. "Down the road there 
\V ill be a breaking point if fees 
keep risi ng and the fin incial 
aid budget stays near present 
levels." 

Ru tter suggested that. if aJl 
va riables stay basically t he 
same, except for ri sing college 
costs, the deficits in some 
student's pocket books wi Jl 
grow larger tha n financial a id 
can make up for. If this 
happens, student financial a id 
packages will not be entirely 
s uffi c ient to meet costs, 
mea n i ng some st ud e n ts 
s imply will not be able to 
afford a higher education. 

Ru tter predicted that this 
cou ld happen in the very near 
fut ure - "no sooner than two 
years, bu t no later than five ." 

T he widen ing def icit is 
current ly being met through 
increased dependence on the 
gove rn ment's Guara nt eed 
Student Loans (GSLl. which 
are repaid after graduation at 
low interest rate::.. However, 
the government has been 
trying to cut down on GSL 
funding by making it more 
difficult to prove "need" in the 
formula for eligibility. 
Regardless of this, there i~ a 
$2,500 a year ,ce~l~n~ for 
undergraciuates. So GSL s wJll 

only absorb some of the co~t . 
untIl e\en they are exceeded. 

GSL 's also create an 
immense finanCial obligation 
following grad uat ion , conceiv-
ably for as much as $10,000. 
Ruter admitted this inade 
quacy, but noted that there 
was "a di fference between not 
going to school and havi ng a 
staggering obligation. Su rely, 
we won't have doors shut." he 
said. 

According to Rut ter, 3.000 
students are on need·based 
financial aid . He explaIned 
that "We funded every needy 
student that applied," 

Yet because funds are 
usually directed to the most 
needy, the lower-middle and 
middle class students are often 
hurt the most. Considered too 
rich for financial aid by 
stringent government stan· 
dards, they must bear the full 
burden of rising fee s 
themselves. 

"The University of 
California is aware of the 
problem, and is doing aJl It 
can," said Marilyn Jaeger, 
Coordi nator of Financial Aid 
for t h e Univeristy of 
California. 

"We are cer tainly clamor ing 
to t ry to convi nce the federal 
government. but we have no 
positive cont rol." said Jaeger. 
Since t he funds for the UC 
system are so dependent on 
state a nd federal legis la tures, 
t he problem hinges on these 
two scurces. As Jaeger 
explained, "The UC Regents 
can only work with what t hey 
are given ." 

"You can take a pessimistic 
or opt imistic atiti tude," said 
Jaeger. " ) don't see any profit 
in being pessimistic. I don't 
think t here is a realistic 
possibi lity of closed doors on 
students' educations. 

"There is a deFinite 
tightening of the times, but I 
hope the economy Improves 
a nd cuts are restored . We are 
doing as much as we can do." 
she said, meaning impressing 
federal and state legislatures 
with the value of educatIOn 
and of more creative funding. 

One proponent of lower 
education costs in the State 
Legis lature is Democrat John 
Garamendi . In a recent article. 
called "The TuitIon Trap," he 
wrote: "We need the new jobs,

AS Elections Are Coming Up 
l'untinucd from I>agc 1 
with all rules pertaining to the conduct of 
their campaign. They are not allowed to 
deface or remove any campaign material 
other than their own, and are prohibited 
from campaigning within 100 feet of any 
polling area. 

If a candidate has violated a rule stated 
in the Election Codes or has been accused 
of violating one, s uch as exceeding the 
campaign expenditure, fal s ifying forms 
required by the Election Codes, 

Solomon Amendment 
Ruled Unconstitutional 

According to Chu and the 1983-84 
Election Codes, the campaign 
expenditure limit for this year's election 
is $100 per candidate and $600 per slate. 

Each item of supplies as well as the 
estimated cost or value of donated items 
used by each candidate must be recorded 
on the Campaign Income Expense 
Record. 

An original receipt along with a sample 
of each itemized expenditure (campaign 
flyers, election banners) must be attached 
to the Campaign Income Expense Record 
and turned in to the AS Asvisor's office 
before any campaign material is 
distributed . 

According to both Chu and Eichhorn, 
the campaign expenditure is a strictly 
regulated procedure, and unlike state and 
government politios, which do not have a 
spending limit school politics must have a 
limit, because as Eichhorn pointed out, 
"Students simply do not have a lot of 
money to spend on their campaigns." 
Both agree however that it is a difficult 
rule to enforce, 

"Each candidate is supposed to record 
all items they use in their campaigns, 
including the pens they may write with , 
Yet there will be a few student s who will 
not itemize their supplies and who will 
get away with it. We can only hope that 
all the candidates are honest," stated 
Eichhorn, 

Although the Elections Commission 
oversees the process , the ultimate 
responsibility uf ensuring supplies are 
recorded and that the campaIgn 
expenditure does not exceed its limit, falls 
upon Chu and the AS AdVisor Rand y 
Woodard , 

- tampering with the ballots or 
infringement of constitutionally granted 
rights of free speech, press, protest or 
association, a violatIOn form must be filed 
in writing by 4:30, April 20th, Any 
qualified voter may file an alllegation. 

Upon receipt of a Violation Form , a 
time, date and place for a meeting of the 
Board of Inquiry shall be determined by 
Elections Commissioner Eichhorn. 

According to her, the AS used to have a 
list of major and minor violations, but she 
explained that "Student politics being 
what it is, we had to eliminate the list 
because some candidates were using it to 
try and disqualify each other. Now if they 
make allegations, they make them at the 
cost of their own campaigns," 

In the past elections, Chu estimates 
that the percentage of voter turnout has 
been about 15 to 25 percenl. Although thi s 
may appear to be a low percentage, he 
claims that if one looks across the nation, 
other s tudent elections are similar. 
However, Chu expects voter turnout thi s 
year to be a little higher than previous 
years due to the financial Issues currently 
so pertinent. 

As for next year, Chu believes the 
future AS Cabinet will be facing a tough 
year. 

"The 1984-85 year will be just as tough 
as this year, The most serious problem 
they will have to deal with are tho-e 
involving the budget cuts, Another Issue 
they will face is the Solomon Amendment 
v.hich is commonly referred to a. the 
Drop Registration Act." 

Filing for candidacy ends Wednesday, 
April 7th, Required form~ can be picked 
up In t he A Admior's office between 8:00 
am and 4:30 pm. Voting will take place 
Apnl 19th and 20th. 

l"Olll il) lied from pa/-ll' 3 
Amendment to the Constllu· 
tlOn, 

Bills of Attainder are laws 
which legislatively determine 
gUilt and mfllct pUnIshment 
upon an identifiable indiVidual 
or group without the standard 
protections of due process and 
a judicial trial. Bills of 
Attainder are prohibited under 
Article I. section 9 of the U,S, 
Constitution , 

The well-known Fifth 
Amendment provides that no 
person "shall be compelled in 
any criminal case to be a 
witness against him elf.., ." 
M-Pirg claimed that the law 
would penalize those students 
who as~ert the Fifth 
Amendment privilege by 
denying them access to Title 
IV funds or mcrimInating 
those students who choo~e to 
assert thiS priVilege 

In finding for M-Plrg the 
court held that: (1) there was a 
threat of irreparable harm to 
5t udents If the government 
Vvere not enjoined from 
enforcing the law, (2) that 
greater harm would come to 
the government if It were not; 
(3) that it IS probable that M-
Pirg will be able to esta blish a 
case for the unconstitutional-
ity of the law at a later time; 
and (4) that enjoining the 
government from enforcing 
the law at thiS time IS In the 
public Interest. 

The effect uf the court'~ 
ruling IS that the federal 
government cannot impll'm-

ent the law at thiS time, The 
court's order does not howe\ er 
stup the promulgatmg and 
adopt ing of regulations to 
implement the law. 

Kath y Gilberd, of the 
National LaVvyer's Guild here 
m San Diego commented on 
the effects of Abop\ rulIng by 
statmg that, "Until the cuurts 
have given more direction 
there is no waj to know 
definately what is gomg to 
happen ." 

Gilberd explained t hat, for 
the present. it IS up to the 
mdividual colleges to decide 
whether forms for certIfying 
registratIon will be implemen-
ted . GIlberd added that, "If a 
lot of people complamed to 
their InstitutIOns labout the 
Solomon Amendment) , then 
thiS may Indeed have an 
effect. ..

Getting the Competitive 
Edge with P .L.E.A. 

Spnng quarter is finally beginning, and everyone is 
thinking about grades. This is particularly worri orne for 
graduate or professional schools. Between G.P.A. level 
and entrance exam test scores. the competition and 
tension to be accepted can be overwhelming. P.L.E.A., the 
Pre·La\\' Education Association. In coordination with 
Kaplan Education Centers, ha\'e decided to glVe at least 
two PCSD students an advantage. Kaplan course' are 
de Igned to aid students in preparing for entrance exams 
Including G R.E .. L.S.A.T., G.M.A.T., M.C.A.T., D.A.T. 
and C.P.A. 

Standard Kaplan courses are from 10·15 hours a week 
for 8 weeh with material prepared by top professionals 
and students in their respect ive fields. The courses 
consist of study tapes, concentrated repet ition and 
reinforcement in the tested areas, and directed classes 
designed for the achievement of superior test scores. 
Kaplan has been the leader in test preparatIOn for over 40 
year. and has over 11 t centers natIOnwide. Kaplan wan ts 
to let students in on thei r success without havi ng to pay 
the usual three t? four hundred dollar fee, and has !-,riven 
two free course tickets to P.L.E.A. to use in a fund raiser. 
P.L.E.A. was fo rmed to help educa te and inform student s 
Interested in pursuing a career in law. The club will be 
holding a racn e during the firs t :3 weeks of Spring quarter 
for one course tIcket, and will make the second available in 
an open auction during the second week. Comejoin in and 
gain the competiti ve edge with the "Club of the '80s".

Captured 
: Hydrogen 
Observed 

Scientists at Los Alamos 
National Laboratory, operated 
by UC for the Dept. of Energy, 
have observed a "captured" 
hydrogen molecule for the first 
tif!1e, closing another gap in 
sCIence. 

Hydrogen atoms, normally 
found bound to other atoms, 
are a component of all living 
matter and many inorganic 
substances. However, when 
two hydrogen atoms are held 
together by chemical forces, 
they form a hydrogen 
molecule. Molecules, made of 
groups of atoms. have their 
own chemical properties. 

Hyd rogen molecules are 
very reactive and often break 
apart when they interact with 
metal s. However at Los 
Alamos . Gregory j. Kubas has 
found a metal complex that 
binds hydrogen molecules 
withough breaking them 
apart. Crystals of thIS 
complex. containing the bound 
molecular hydrogen. were 
grown by Kubas. and theIr 
!>tructure was characterized 
by Phillip J. Vergamini with a 

I new analysis in s trument 
developed at the Laboratory . 

Kubas and Vergamini. 
together with colleagues 
Hobert R. Ryan, Harvery ]. 
Wasserman , and A. C. Larson, 
of the Isotope and Structural 

I Chemistry Group. feel that the new compound provides the I first workable ~odel for many 
types of studIes. 

Hoffman, Fraser of LANL 
Honored for Contributions 

Darleane Hoffman. leader of 
the Isotope and Nuclear 
Chemistry Division at Los 
Alamos National Laboratory 
was presented the American 
Chemical Society's (ACS) 
Nuclear Chemistry Award. 
Monday, March 21. The 
award, one of 37 awards 
spanning a broad range of 
areas, was presented in 
Seattle, Wash., at the ACS's 
185th national meeting. 

The award is presented for 
her contributions tothe field of 
nuclear chemistry, and is 
accompanied by a $3,000 prize. 

Hoffman, recognized as an 
international authority on 
nuclear chemistry, is credited 
with the discovery of naturally 
occurring plutonium-244 and 
with the co-discovery of 
californium·256. einsteinium· 
256m, mendelevium-258, and 
fermium-259. She is con-
s idered a pioneer in determin-

ing the existence, fission 
ability and decay properties 0 
transuranic elements, those 
heavier than uranium. 

She received a Ph.D. i 
physical chemistry from Iowa 
State University, and joined 
the staff at Los Alamos in 
1953, after working at Oak 
Ridge National Laboratory for 
a year. 

Susan Fraser , a form 
undergraduate research 
assistant in the Isotope and 
Nuclear Chemistry Division 
led by Hoffman , also received 
an award at the eattle 
meeting. The 1982 Charles 
Coryell Award is accompani 
by $500. Fraser, now a medical 
student at the University of 
New Mexico, devised'a method 
for detecting very low 
concentrations of iodine-129 in 
water taken from the site of 
u.nderground nuclear explo-
sIOn.

Caliiornia Coast Heats Up-
cientists Attend Informal 

Weather Workshop at Scripps 
By CL YDENE NEE 

taft Writer 
The winter storms which 
ected almost all of our lives 

this winter may have been 
'on Iy a part of a greater climatic 
anomaly that is occuring 
because of a warming trend in 
he s urface sea water 
mperature_ This phenome-

non. known as EI Nino, was 
the topic of discussion at a 
recent workshop. organized by 
Catherine Cautier , John 
Horel. and Gary Meyers from 

cripps Institution of 
nography (SIO), held two 

ago at SIO. 
Over 100 oceanographers, 

meteorologists, and other 
scientists gathered for this 
informal workshop to discuss 
·heir own observations of the 

I Nino phenomenon, and "to 

encourage interdisciplinary 
collaboration within 510 and 
nearby institutions." 

EI Nino means "the child" 
and is the term that was fi rst 
used by Peruvian fisherman to 
describe the occurance of 
warming ocean temperatures 
that begin around Chirstmas 
time coinciding with the 
Nativity. 

The phenomenon came to 
world attention when the 1972 
EI Nino severly decreased the 
anchovy population off the 
Peruvian coast, which 
im pacted the world production 
of fish meal. a primary 
ingredient in livestock and 
chicken feed. This spurred a 
rise in the price of chicken and 
other livestock. and also a 
price rise in other protein 

substitutes such as soybeans. 
The preci se cause of El Nino 

is not known at the moment, 
but it is tied very closely with 
the trade-winds, and the 
atmospheric pressure zones. 

Other SCientists at this 
workshop presented theirown 
special observations of thIS 
phenomenon. induding: 

-The surface waters in the 
tropical Pacific are as much as 
4°C higher than normal;

Los Alamos has worked for 
more than four years on 
development of a space reactor 
concept in a program called the 
SP-I00, funded by the 
Department of Energy (DOE) 
and the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration 
(NASA). The SP-tOO Program 
was designed to develop the 
technology for a space power 
reactor, with initiation of 
ground testing by 1986. Such a 
reactor could deliver large 
amounts of power for 
relatively long periods with 
high reliability. 

In its new role, the 
Laboratory will no longer be 
responsible for heat pipe 
reactor design, but instead will 
concentrate on managing the 
critica l technologies needed 
for concepts now being 
developed by various 
companies and laboratories 
including General Atomic 
Technologie s, General 
E lectric Company, and 
We sti nghou se Electric 
Corporation . 

The Laboratory's expanded 
role also includes development 
of cri teria to assess the 
effectiveness of reactor 
designs, their reliability, and 
sa fety .

A 5-16 Record: Accomplishment? 
By JEFF SAVAGE 

Staff Writer 
The UCSD baseball team is 

sporting a 5· ]6 record this 
season and Head Coach Lyle 
Yates find s it rather 
interesting . " Our record 
sounds ridiculous but It IS 
right on chedu le. And ~ hat 
sounds even more ridiculous." 
Yates seems content. Perhaps 
he has his wins and losses 
backwards. Or perhaps he's 
simply what you would call a 
"marshmallow coach." Nope. 
Neither assumption is correct; 
in fact , after examining the 
Triton sea on to date, a 5· 16 
mark is, at the very least. a 
respectable one. It cou ld even 
be considered a major 
accomplishment. 

Consider the followmg: 
• Already thiS year 12 games 
have been raIned out,oddly 
enough, eight of the 12 were 
against inferior teams wh ich 
were almost "sure wins" for 
the Tritons. As it stands. 
UCSD has played four games 
against Divis ion II teams and 
seven against Divisiun r clubs. 
UCSD is in the NAIA . 
• Injuries have destroyed 
what was once a solid outfield. 
Left field speedhurner Dave 
Vasi l went down . as did

Sockers Clip Wings 
Attendance High as Club Nears Title 

By ANDREW KEELER 
As the weather gets hotter, 

so do the San Diego Sockers. 
The Sockers have won 13 of 
their last 16 matches and are 
currently comfortably ahead 
in the M fSL Western Division. 

Friday night the team had a 
seven-game winnIng st reak 
snapped in Phoenix. The 
Sockers "gave" t he Inferno the 
game when they let an 8-5 lead 
with less than five minutes to 
play slip away due to mental 
errors. Phoenix then ended the 
contest 12:50 into overtime 
v. ith a Steve David goal 
capping a 9·8 victory. 

ThiS was a big W In for San 
Diego in a number of ways: 

Wit h the \. i c t 0 q . 
goalkeeper Alan Mayer 
collected his 26th win of the 
season. establishing a new 
MISL record. 
- It kept the second place 
Wings 3 1 2 games In back of 

an Diego with only six games 
left In the season. 
- The largest home crowd 
e\'er turned out at the Sports 
Arena. In fact. when the 
12.039 attendance figure was 
announced, the San Diego 
players and coaches stood and 
applauded.

This loss wa~ hard for the

The Guardian Predicts the NL West 
Bbn~~~' ~jic~!~;d~E 

The season isn'l officially 
open yet, bUI farsighted 
individuals are even now 
predicting how the season will 
end. fs this the yearthe Padres 
make it to the playoffs. or. dare 
we say it . the Series? Or will 
experience tell, and the 
Dodgers go all the way? This is 
how we see the standings in 
the National League West in 
September: 

Los Angeles will sit in first 
place. The Dodgers may have 
lost Steve Garvey and Ron 
Ccy, but they've got the best 
established starting pitch ing 
of any team in the league in 
Valenzuela. Niedenfuerer, and 
Reuss . Furthermore. their 
farm sys tem ha s neatly 
groomed Mike Marshall and 
Greg Brock for the da y when 
Garvey and Cey left the team . 

In second place, San Diego. 
They're the only team In the 
league that's madc subslantial 
improvement s in their 
personnel , and wit h the 
acq UISlt ion of (;arv('~. they 
finally have major leagu(;'r~ in 
all positions. In th l' past.

Predictions are as integral a part of baseball as the basepaths themselves. Before the regular 
season opens for business tomorrow, Guardian staffers predict the NL West for the second year 
in a row. Of the five prognostications for last season, only one was even close: Joe Fallella 's, 
forecasting that the Dodgers (Ihe 1955 Dodgers) would take the pemlant.

Staff Writer 

Cincinnati .... Houston .. . 
San Francisco .. ,Atlanta ... San 
Diego ... Los Angeles ... Which of 
these teams always seeems to 
have a surplus of bonafide 
superstars come up through 
their minor league system? If 
you guessed Houston or 
Cincinnati. you win a one way 
all expense paid trip to 
Tiperari. The ballclub that 
continually profits from their 
kids down on the farm is the 
Los Angeles Dodgers. and that 
is one reason. along with the 
best starting pitching staff in 
baseball. that the men who 
bleed Dodger blue will be 
victorious in the National 
League West. The Dodgers 
have made some major 
changes, most notably at first 
ba se where Greg Brock 
succeeds Steve Garvey; in 
right field . where Mike 
Marshall replaced Pedro 
Guerrero; and at third base, 
where Guerrero takes over for 
Ron Cey. Even though three 
fourth s of baseba ll's longe ·t 
running infield has been 
discarded over the last two 
seasons, LA has been able to 
replace Garvey. Lopes. and 
Cey with quality performers 
from the minor leagues. After 
all . this is a team that has

Men's Net 
Ranked 14th 

By MIKE GREENBERG 
Staff Writer 

In the past, when one 
mentioned the exciting and 
entertaining sports teams on 
campus, tile UCSD tennis 
team usually would be omitted 
from the conversation. But 
since Head Coach Don Kramer 
took over the helm in early 
December, the Tritons havt: 
been playing championship 
caliber tennis . 

UCSD backers will be able 
to view the men in blue and 
gold today, as the Tritons host 
'cross· town rival San Diego 
State on the Muir courts at 3 
pm . 

Cyclists from across the state competed in the annual UCSD Criterium. The race took place on March 23. 

UCSD, the 14th ranked 
team in the nation , has already 
defeated three teams in the top 
ten in Division III (including 
#3 ranked Gustavus Adol· 
phus) . By virtue of the 
victories, the Tritons have to 
be con sidered prime conten· 
ders for the national title. 
Eight teams are selected for 
the tournament held in 
Alban y, New York, and 
Kramer feels that his team has 
as good a chance as any to 
obtain the prestigious title. 
"This team is going better 
than I anticipated," said the 
Triton coach who previously 
pioneered Torrey Pines High 
School to two CIF semifinal 
appearances. "We would like 
to think we have a good chance 
to win it all." 

Sockers Adtnission Fees: A Good Idea? Months After Inauguration, Fees at UCSD Assessed 
conti Hued from pa~e 17 
outside the penalty box. The 
Sockers added three more 
goals, including Kaz Deyna's 
41st of the season, to lead 4·1 at 
the end of the first quarter. 

The fans began chanting 
'·Piz·za, Piz·za Piz·za" after 
the Sockers scored their sixth 
goal early in the second half. 
(Squa re Pan Pizza gives two 
pieces of pizza to everyone in 
attendance if theSockers score 
eight goals). The Sockers 
responded to the fans' 
gl uttonous desires by notching 
the eventh and eighth goals 
shortly afterwords, driving 
the audience into a pepperoni 
frenzy. 

After this the team became 
lethargic and let the Wings 
close the margin to 8·5, and 
visions of Friday's collapse 
came to mind. uch night·

By JACK WERBOW 
]n an effort to raise money 

for the UCSD athletic 
department. a charge for 
admission into the Main 
Gymnasium for certain 
sporting events was instigated 
at the end of lastjanuary. The 
charge for admission. $1 for 
students, $2 for non·students, 
for men's and women's 
basketball as well as volleyball 
matches, raised a question 
concerning attendance: Has an 
admis£ion fee led to smaller 
crowds at UCSD events? 

HI don't think so," says 
women's basketball Coach 
Judy Malone. "Since we have 
no attendance figures before 
the charge, it's hard to say for 
ure whether there was a drop 

in attendance or not. But 
eyeballing it , I don't think it 
hurt men's basketball and 

volleyball. It might have 
slight ly hurt women's 
basketball on Tuesday nights 
because it's in the middle of 
the week." 

According to Doug Danne-
vik, volleyball coach, " Men's 
volleyball, in the past, has 
never been too popular, so I 
don't think attendance has 
been affected much." 

The charge was started in 
an attempt to raise money for 
UCSD's already short· funded 
athletiC department. "We 
were forced to find alternative 
ources for money," stated 

Coach Malone. HA il of our 
money came from registration 
fees, which was just not 
enough." Women's basketball, 
for example, was allotted a 
budget of $4,000 for the year. 

"We have 29 different sports 
at UCSD," added Malone, "so 

~---.:::. -

we are budgeted lor only one 
overn ight trip a year. So if we 
want to play teams in Los 
Angeles, we have to pay our 
own way." 

Each year travel costs and 
related expenses rise so that a 
team needs more money to 
exist. Stated Malone, "At the 
beginning of the year we voted 
not to charge the students, but 
times have changed ." 

As another means of raising 
money, the athletic depart· 
ment is also considering 
selling a type of seasonal ticket 
that would enable the holder to 
get into all games. This might 
be implemented next year. 

For now, however. thedollar 
charge remains. But despite 
the fee. it appears that Triton 
fans have remained loyal and 
are willing to spend the extra 
dollar to see their teams in 
action. 

- . - - ---

One of the reasons for 
VCSD's fast start has been the 
superb play of junior Eugene 
Jones. Jones. a native San 
Diegan. ha not lost a match 
all year long in singles or 
doubles. . 

Although San Diego State is 
not the powerhouse they once 
were, the Aztecs are a Ime 
Division I team and will be a 
formidible opponent for the 
high·spirited Tritons. Maybe 
the action won't resemble that 
of center court at Wimbledon , 
but for the first time in quite 
awhile, people are starting to 
spread the word about UCSD 
tennis.

Running Thoughts 
By JEFF SAVAGE and MIKE GREENBERG 

SInH Wdters 
Running Thoughts ia a persollal columll of staJ! writers Alike 

Greenberg and Jeff Savage. All opinions expressed are ulllquely 
theirs, and do not represent/he Sports sectiol/. the Guardian, this 
ulliversity, the UC Regents, the Slate of California, or the United 
Slates of America. Also, notice Ihat tizenameofthe COULD IT BE 
DEPT. involves a queshon: "Could it be?" to which the answer is a 
decisive "NO. " 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE DEPT. After ~6 negottatmg 
sessions stretching over the course of nine months , the NBA and 
its players union agreed on a tentative contract last Thursday, 
just two days before a threatened st rike that would have 
interrupted the final two weeks of the season. Now that they've 
agreed on a contract, the question everyone is asking is: Just 
what is it that they've agreed on' We've come up with a better 
question. S ince we have the NCAA tournament final tonight and 
the start of the baseball season tomorrow, as well as the hockey 
playoffs in a couple of weeks and the heart of the USFL seas~m 
right now, does anyone even care that the IBA resolved Its 
mess? 
NOT TO BE BELIEVED DEPT. Houston Cougar slam 
dunks. 
WAIT A MINUTE DEPT. After the Houston Cougars 
destroyed the Villanova Widlcats 89-71 in the Midwest RegIOnal 
finallasl week, Villanova center John Pinone said hiS team wa~ 
not intimidated by Houston's seven foot center Akeem Abdul 
Olajuwon. He also said that Olajuwon was nol the difference In 
the game. Apparently Pinone wasn't talking about the nght 
game, because Olajuwon hit on 11 of 12 shots from the floor and 
blocked eight shots. Said Houston Coach Guy Lewis, ''I'll tell you 

somethin~. He made a difference in the way I felt on the 
sideli nes. ' 
QUOTES EXTRAORDINAIRE DEPT. From American 
League umpire Bill Kunkel, who says he has mellowed after 
overcoming a bout with cancer. "I used to get into an argument 
with player and throw him out 10 a minute. Now I'm more 
tolerant. I throw 'em out In two." 
COULD IT BE DEPT. Di~cussion from within the l ' nited 
States Football League has begun to surface concerning the 

fea~ibility of a merger with the NatIOnal Football League by 
1985. Sources close to us have revealed that USFL Pres ident 
Chet Simmons and NFL CommissIOner Pete Rozelle are in 
agreement on a plan to combIne the USFL and NFL to form the 
new 40 team VSNFL. But what about cities like Phtladelphla, 
Chicago, and Denver that will have two teams? Simmons say~ 
that "It could be a blessing 10 dIsguise by etablishing 
tremendous intra'Clt y nvalne'i," And Rozelle adds in"ight by 
saying, "Hey, two teams a re better than one."

manager Joe Torre has to work

Steve Garvey and Ed Whitson,

the young pitching arms of 
Lollar. Shu\\-. Draveckv. and

not only the diviSIOn. but the

Lauder's 
Predictions 
continued (rom page J 7 
and their efforts won't be good 
enough to overtake LA this 
season. 

The Padres wi ll take third . 
stay ing within str iking 
distance throughout the 
season as they did for all but 
the last two weeks of last 
year's campaign. But they 
won't quite make it to the top. 
Good defense, a better than 
average offense , and the 
nucleus of a good pitching staff 
all will keep the Padres above 
fourth. Inexperience among 
the rest of the throwers will 
keep San Diego away from the 
division crown - again. 

And then there's the Giants. 
It all came together for SF and 
the end of last season, and only 
a shortage of time kept them 
from the Western title last 
season. Considering the talent 
of the club - definitely NOT 
the greatest in the division -
neglecting to name Frank 
Robinson a Manager of the 
Year in 1982 was a felony 
crime, But off-season losses 
and trades of players have 
further depleted the talent, 
and despite a very good relief 
corps, the club will hover 
around .500 throughout the 
year, good for fourth place. 

Houston and Cincy are odds-
on-favori tes to flop again in 
1983. Houston should have a 
better season than last; I'm not 
sure why, but they should, 
The Reds went from near· best 
to worst last season and will go 
from worst to worst this 
season. The Big Red Machine 
is now the Liggle Red Engine 
that Couldn't, and Can't, and 
Won't. 

LA, Atlanta, SO, SF, 
Houston and CIncinnatI in 
order In the West. ' And that"s 
the way it is."

DEFLATED 
BIKES? 

No, we don't mean that the tires need air . 
BIKE Prices are down. 

As Bicycling Magazine Editor, James C. McCullagh saId In 
their last issue "Never has the market offered such good buys 
at such low prices". We at the UCSD Bike Shop heartily 
agree. 

Background: For the past three years nationwide bicycle sales 
have been declmmg In a recesslonary economy, by now supphers 
warehouses are packed With bicycles they optimistically ordered 
expecting an economic recovery. Add an aggressive new challenge 
from TaIwanese manufacturers to a Japanese dominated West Coast 
market to further bulge the bike supply. Your result IS a buyer's 
market where supply far outstnps demand. 

Our Approach: In prevIous years we've picked one manufacturer 
or two, whose line of bikes offered our customers the be~t value for 
their dollar. But In thiS year With enormous supply and slashed prices. 
we've thrown away old loyalties and are buymg bikes only as each 
model and price offer you outstanding value 

The Result : Is d selection of bIkes from five different 
manufacturers. Never have we been able to offer a quality 10 speed as 
inexpenSive aswe do now: $13995 We thmk you 'lI agree the rest of our 
selection shows new levels of quahty at exceptional low prices. 
We can't promise thl~ situation wlllidst forever , smce many of our 
purchases are one time deals on overstocked Id~t year's model!> . So 
come see us soon for the best selection, and we'll get you rol li ng on 
great new wheels at Depression Prices I

offen ive end of it. Guerrero 
will lead the league in both 
homeruns and errors. The 
start ing pitching is s uperb, 
but Burt Hooton will injure hIs 
arm early and Fatnando 
Valenzuela will run into a 
junior jinx. The pen i suspect. 

The San Diego Padres will 
fare even better than last year 
by finishing six games out. No 
more. No less. The Pads have a 

43: 

but will not be enough as the 
Pirates begin a slide Into the 
lower divis ion . 

Lack of dependable pitching 
and fielding will keep Mel 
Ott's Giants in fifth this year. 
The offensive looks strong 
with Ott, Ernie Lombardi, and 
Bill Jurges, but the hitting will 
not make up for New York 's 
defensive s hortcomings. 

Cincinnati will plummet 
from la ·t year's third place 

good relieving corps and Tim 
Lollar will have another good 
season . No ot her starter will 
win more than 12 games. 
Garry Templeton will lead the 
league in hitting. Sixto 
Lezcano will drive in over 120 
runs. Steve Garvey will be a 
big disappoint ment. 

The Atlanta Braves have 
little more than Bob Horner 
and Dale Murphy. I st ill can't 
figure how they won it las t 
yea r. They won' t thi year. 
The Braves wi ll fini sh 15 
game back, probably more. 

The Houston Astro have a 
good pitching rotation which 
will keep a lot of their 
ballgames close. They'll lose 
most of them. Houston won't 
average more than three runs 
a game. At leas t they won 't 
finish la t though. That honor 
goe to the Cincinnati Red • 
who will do their impre ion of 
Houdini and disappear in the 
first month of the season. Not 
before owner Dick Wagner

Miller's good glove work at

catch up with him sooner or 
later and it is doubtful he'll 
repeat his league-leading 
performance of last year with 
23 wins_ 

Winding up again irretriev-
ably mired in the cellar in 1945 
will be the Phillies. With a 
pitching rotation that gets all

Philadelphia will repeat with 
at leas t one 20 game loser and 
has a good shot at s urpassing 
last year's tota l of 92 losses 
with at least 100. Reliever 
Andy Karl and center fielder 
Vince DiMaggio are the club's 
only rays of hope. Karl will 
probably save a dozen games 
for the Phillies - for what is 
anyone's guess.

The Triton Batsmen: 
the Hard Luck Kids? 
l'I)I\ I i I1lH.·d frolll paj{t' I 7 
What next? 

Going into a Saturday 
afternoon league doubleheader 
at Biola two days ago, the 
Tritons stood 0-4 in league 
play. They were down and 
nearly out early . But somehow 
they managed to sweep the 
doubleheader (the first sweep 
of a league doubleheader in the 
school's history), and now find 
themselves very much in the 
NAJA District 3 race. Dave 
Jankowski drove in two runs, 
and ace pitcher Mike Brown 
managed his third win of the 
year as UCSD nipped Biola 4-3 
in the opener. Jankowski, 
Soott Melendrez, and Brian 
Kummer collected three hits 
apiece as the Tritons outlasted 
Biola 7-6 in the nightcap. 
Senior Eric Reynolds had six 
strikeouts and notched his 
first win of the season. Keith 
Yokomoto had an outstanding 
day as he managed to pick up 
saves in both games. 

Yates explain", "Our goal was 
two-fold. Number one, to get 
experience by playing superior 
team s, and numbert wo, to get 
the exposu re for the players. I 
had no aspirations of winning 
the thing." In playing eight 
games, the Tritons lost three 
time by a s ingle run and 
managed one victory over the 
University of Massachusettes 
7-5. The club's .276 batting 
average was fourth best and 
was nearly twice as high as 
last year. Mike Brown won his 
only decision and went 6 for 15 
(.446) at the plate. Freshman 
Scott Melendrez hit at an 
amazing .533 clip to lead all 
hitters in the Classic. Both 
were selected to the AIl -
Tournament team . The team's 
overall earned run average 
was rather high at 6.46 runs 
per game and the pitchers 
surrendered 44 walks in the 
tournament while striking out 
only 17.

During the spring break 
UCSD competed in the annual 
Sunlite Classic held at San 
Diego State. The Tritons, as 
expected, did not fare well in 
the tournament, if you 
consider only wins and losses. 
By facing Div. I teams that 
offers scholarships, UCSD had 
little chance of winning. As 

Bu t the 1983 Sunlite Classic 
is over and UCSD is in the 
heart of league play at 2-4. 
Coming off the doubleheader 
sweep of Biola, the Tritons 
have some momentum, and it 
is time to see what they can do 
with it. They host a tough PI. 
Lorna College ballclub 
tomorrow at Olsen Field . 
Game time is 2:30. 

UCSD's pitches against the University of Washington wound up in the field a little too often 
for the Tritons during the Sunlite Classic.

nottcable off of the coast of 
Peru, so the cause of the El

re~earch. 
Workshop organizer Dr. 

Gary Mevers, from 510, 
explained some of his own fIeld 
of study, the temperature field 
I n the tropical part of the 
Pacific Ocean. This year 
Meyers has been particularly 
fortunate to have various 
comme rcial merchant fleet 
\ es~eb place hIS temperature 
measuring deVIces In remote 
regions of the Pacific. These 
deVIces can measure water 
temperature from surface 
level to 500 meters. 

The trade-winds can be 
responstble for moving the 
v.armer surface water, and 
aliov.Ing the moler deeper 
water to rise to the surface, 
v. hich leads to a natural 
coohng pr()('e~s . When the 
Winds and currents change, 
then this cooling process is 
I hrown out of balance. and the 
surface water could retain 
more heat. 

Meyers said that he was 
very encouraged by the 
obsenatlOns made at the 
workshop, and b) the 
intradiscipllnary contrlbu · 
tions that were made by those 
vr/ho attended. 

Although GoutIer of SIO felt 
that the press and the media 
lost track of the real purpose of 
thiS mformal workshop by 
trying to make it seem more 
formal than it was, she felt It

orne desk jobs are 
more exciting than 
other, 

As a Navy pilot 
or flight officer, your 
desk can be a sophis· 
ticated combination 
of supersonic jet air-
craft and advanced electronic equipment. 
But you can handle it. Because Navy 
flight training gives you the navigation , 
aerodynamics and other technical 
know-how you need. 

In return, Navy aviation demands 
s(lrnething of you as an officer: 
Leader ·hip. 

Your path to leadership starts with 
officer training that's among the most 
demanding in the military. It's intensive 
leadership and professional schooling 
combined with rigorous Navy flight 
training. And it's all geared to prepare 
you and other college 
graduates for the
