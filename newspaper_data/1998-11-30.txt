THANKSGIVING: Som

By Jeffrey M. Barker 
Sentor Staff Wnter 

Though I11mt people do not reali/c il. 
some students spend Thanksgiving Day on 
campus. The few ~tudents who I.:ou ld not , 
or did not \ ant to, ~pl'nd the hoi ida awa 
from ~chool had the I.:ampu~ to them ·elve:-. 
last weekend. 

April ewland, a resident advbor in 
the Thurgood Marshall Apartments, said 
that students may decide to stay on call1pu~ 
during the four-day break for various rea-
sons, including distanl.:e from hOlllc and 
schoolwork. 

"Sumc :-. tudcnts arc too far frolll home." 
ewland said. "Some student~ \ay they 

have 100 much to do That wouldn't he rea-
son to keep me here." 

ew land said she was spendi ng 
Thanksgiving on campus because of her 
RA duties and the long distance 10 her 
hometown of Fresno. However, 'he said 
some family members made the trip to 
:-.pend the day with her. 

Marshall student Chri s henoweth. 
who sa id he could not afford to Il y home to 
Lake Tahoe, feasted on turkey in his 
Marshall apartment. His sister and her 
hoy friend celebrated the day wi th him on 
his second Thanksgiving spent on I.:ampus. 

Both tht: Price en ter and the Student 
enter were closed on Thanksgiving. 

Geisel Lihrary and all the campus cafete-
rias also shut their doors to students on 
Thanksgiving Day. 

"They Ithe students] arc prelly much on 
their own," said Mike Steins, who worked 
as a receptionist in the John Muir 
Residential Life oflice on Thanks!(iving. 
He said Muir College had nothing planned 
for the students stay ing at U SO. 

On the other hand, Revelle allege 
Residential Life sponsored a Thanksgiving 
feast. Brenda Andrews, a Revelle assistant 
resident dean, said she did not expcctmany 
students to stay on campus, however. 

"At least, very few [students I would 
participate. Last year there were two," 
Andrews said. 

Marshall Assistant Resident Dean 
Diane Rouda said that the college hosted a 
dinner for over 40 students during the 
weekend prior to Thanksgiving, but that 
she is expecting very few students to spend 
the actua l holiday on campus. 

Foreign student living in the 
International House (I-House) can n t 
travel home for a four-day weekend and do 
not usually celebrate Thank 'giving any-
way. The I-House, though, hosted a 
potluck for its reSidents and 40 to 50 tu -
dents altended the event.

Link Between Bulimia 
And Genes May Exist 
SCIENCE: Researchers discover that alteration in 
brain chemi try could lead to eating di order 
By Kelly Ruane 
The Pitt News (U. Pittsburgh) 

PIITSBU RGH, Penn. - A new 
study ha~ found a hiologica llink 10 
bulimia and ~u gg.:s t s that the (Ji~or­

Rese"rI,;hcr~ hc"ded ny Walter 
K aye, pro fessor of psyd li :,ltry at the

Center Western Psychiatric In~titute, 
Imvc di~covered evidence that an 
alterJllon in hrain chemi ~try (;()uld 
possibly he the underlying l:uuse o f

Bulimia nervosa is a seri ous eat-

Bulimia affects I to 3 pcn:cnt 01 
women, orren people who arc of 
normal hody weight. Bulimia u~u ­
ally hegins during adolcscem:e. 

It is known that women with 
bulimia, when hinge ea ting and 
purging, have alterations in hrain 
serotonin acti vity, a chemical neu-
ro transmitter in the brain that helps 
regulate mood and contrihut.:s to 
an ohse~s i on with p.:rleuionism. 

The study found that even alter 
the rel:Overy from hulimia. the 
alterations and sy mptoms (;()ntin-

j ust a conse4uence of ahnormal 
eating pallern s. 

" Our ~tudy may have identified 
a hiological rb k factor that plays a 
rLl1'1 in ueciding who devel()ps a 
disorder," Kayc said. "Thi ~ stud y IS 
import ant becau~e it w ill hel p shin 
focus \0 the underly ing cau~es of 
hulimia ~() we can deve lop heller 

treatments in the future and possi-
hly identi ry people at rbk of the 
disorder nefore it occur~." 

Bulimia causes medical prob-
lems in the gastrointestinal tract. 
irregular or non-existent menstrual

obsess i ve-compulsi ve disordcr. 
Bulimia also frequentl y cau ~e~

Becau~e malnutri tion aSSOCiated 
w ith eating di sordc r~ affec t ~ brai n 
chembtry, Kaye and his team per-
rormed a study that l:Ompared 31 
healthy women to 30 women who 
had recovered from bulimia. 

The women were of norm al 
. hody weight. had regular menstrual 
cycles, and had not hinged or 
purged for more t han a year. 
Researchers looked for continu ing 
hehavioral disturhances and a l ~o 
measured the levels of major brain 
chemica ls such as serotonin . 
dopamine and norepinephrine, in 
Ihe rewvered participants. 

)n addit ion, the recovered 
women were gi ven a nontherap.:u-

" Whik further research is need-

TECHNOLOGY COMPLICATES UCSD EXTENSION OFFERS: 
COMMENTARY: 
Technological progre s 
only makes things 
more complicated 
By Linda Varon 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Technology as we know it is 
changing, complicating the SII11 -
plicity or past theories of soc ial and 
individual inner calmness. In trying 
to dec ide bClween the need for 
technulogy and Ihe yearning ror 
communication , some may lind it 
hard to maintain an cffccti ve bal -
ance. 

Many red compelled tu con-
stantly interact with olhers. 
Co mputcrs, faxes, Ie lephones. 
pagers and cc ll phones have 
bccome common form s or contact 
with thc outside world . As c-mail 
and telccommuting arc rapid ly tak -
ing thcir place in the technological 
age, the need ror physica l human 
contact is hei ng eliminated and 
replaced with accessiblc tcchnolog-
ica l commu nication . How grcal a 
problcm thi s wi ll bc is yCI to he 
uctcrm incd _ 

Many have failed to avoid Icch-
no log ical re liancc. My hreaking 
point camc aher my sccond month 
at co llege whcn I was asked a ravor 
that (;ou ld on ly hc returned through 
c-mail. I now lind myselr among 
thc "c- lI1ai I addicts" Whelher or 
not my unwillingness to conrorl1l l1J 
thc times has 11l:cn justillcd, I now 
do nOI havc a choice hut to givc in . 

TIll! simple pleasurc or n:ceiv-
illg lett crs and cards rrom fricnds 
has been rep lDced wilh new melh-
ods of communication . The opli on 
of instant mail , imtan l gratill cati on 
and inslant knowledge o r Ihe world 
arounu us is at our Ilngcrtips. But 
what ir we would ralher not know? 
Wc lind oursc lves writing lellers to 
obscurc people (10 whom, if not for 
Ihe wondcrful world of e-mail , we 
wo uld neve r havc wrlttcn), while 
there is a constant struggle 10 read 
through all Ihe lowercase mum-
blings and half-Iini shed senl ences 
in our "in hoxes ." 

The integril Y and siahilil y Ihat 

The simple pleasure 
of receiving letters 
and cards from 
friends has been 

r~placed with new 
methods of 
communication. The 
option of instant 
mail, instant 
gratification and 
instant knowledge 
of the world around 
us is at our 
fingertips. But what 
if we would rather 
not know? 
accompanies a we ll-wri llen leller 
arc s lowly hecoming losl and 
sacr.:d , as the trcnd IowaI'd e- mai I 
incrcase,. Hopping on the c-mail 
ha nd wagon may hc a wcak ne,s of 
characler. We musl stop 10 qu.:sti on 
our moti ves I' r using such lechn ol-
ogy. 

T here is a son of half-di " lp-
pOinl ll1C nl that comes wi th the lirsl 
.:-mai I rrom a rriend who once 
wrote lellcrs on paper. The nonex -
is tcnt errort that it now takes to 
wri te or communicale makes you 
wonder if it is only convenicnce 
that is kceping your rri end wri ling. 
Or mayhe a railure to clkctivcl y 
change with the timcs is mirrored 
hy a longing ror a past when a 
mai Ihox would have a rriendl y and 
oUldated ph ys ica l note of hell o 
from an old fri cnu . Or quitc possi-

hly a tendency 10 llvcranalY/c anu 
queslion the ohvlous ha, rorced me 
to make a JFK conspiracy nUl Ihe 

pro~pce l nr e-mail. 
Do 110t ge l me wrong. 

Technology is goou. Had it nOI 
been for ted1l1olog , on\.! I ou Id 
have to eliminatt: Ihe slri vi ng for 
tedmological pcrfcclion Ihal pro-
pels soc ieties 10 reach limits they 
otherwisc would not. A lithe same, 
one must stop and quest ion I hc 
reli ance our society has placcu on 
tcchnology. 

Technology has ad vanceu at 
aimosl an unthinkable rate Ihi s last 
uccade; il is Ihi s advun(;cmenl Ihat 
leads us 10 question ir what we sec 
as progrcss is not merel rrogress, 
hUI also (;omplication. Th.: amount 
of new technology that we ha ve 
scen lately poses an even biggcr 
qucstion or what is to come in the 
future , There is no limit as to the 
typcs of advances we may sec in 
our lifetimc, and certainly what 
generations to come will sce in 
theirs. 

There is il certain sense or con-
tentment that ill:companies being 
ignorant or the world outsidc La 
10lla 's shores, Although slUpiuity is 
said to he thc equi va lcncc of hliss , 
there is no placc in society for one 
who reruses to change wi th the 
timcs. Tcd Kazinski round thi s nul

STUDENTS STRUGGLE FOR HIGHER EDUCATION 
COMMENTARY: 
Stand up for students 
who cannot receive 
higher education in Iran 
By Tandls Arjmand 
Special to the Guardian 

As linal s are approaching, I am 
making my usual sprint for the fi n-
ish line, cramming and ~tudying 
hard for my exams. II is oft en hard 
to remember that at thi s time, while 
I am ~tudying in this cou ntry With 
millions of ot her stude nt ~. Illy 
Baha ' i ,bter, and hrother, in Iran 
arc being deprived 01 this one ~ im ­
pic privi lege that I takc for granted 
everyday : the right to receive a 
higher education. 

For a moment, Imagi ne a world 
in which MCAT scores and GPA~ 
do not I.:ount , when: no lIlatter how 
high you ,core on your entrance 
exam you an: , till not al lowed to 
enter ,chool. A world in whi l.: h 
then: arc no hex)k, to huy. no cluh 
lIu!eting, to hold and 110 offil.:c 
hours to attend. A world In which 
people l:a nnot freely ohtain edul.:a-
tion ,i mply ht'cau,e of their rel i-
gioll , helici's 

La,t month, Iran \ Shii t..: Mu.,lim 
Government shut down a Baha'i 

ni versi ty wi th nearly 1.000 stu-
dents, an'ested 36 faculty members 
and conlisc<l ted hook!<., equipment 
and papers. Over 50() private home~, 
where lel.: tures and classes were 
being held, were raided. Tragically, 
these student s who have neve r been 
allowed entrance into puhlic un iver-
sities have once again been denied 

the right to a higher education. 
The Baha'i Institute for Higher 

educa tion (BIHE), also known as 
the Open Universi ty, sta rted in 
1997 in response 10 the banni ng of 
Baha' is rrom Iranian uni versi ties 
after the Islami c Revo luti on of 
1979 because of their rcligi ou~ 
hcl iefs. These a<.: tions were carried 
out hy of'ticers under the direction 
of' the Ministry of Information, an 
intelligence agency of the Iranian 
government. Thme arre,ted were 

a~kcd to ~ign dcdarations that 
BIHE was now aholished and that 
they wou ld no longer he In volved 
with it. They refu~ed to sign. 

An older ~tudent who mis~cd 
out on nearly I () years of ed ucat ion

\'c r~ lI y. I did very well . but after thc 
Ii r~t semester, which was 1(71). all 
th e universi ties were clmcd , 
hCl.:au,c pf the revolution ." 

According to Ih\! studellt , when 
the uni vcr'IIY reope ncd, ol'liclab 
ask d all the Baha ' i ~tudents to 
write on the readmis:.ion form that 
they w..:re Muslim' . 

" I didn ' l writ..: it , and th..:y 
cx relied me from the university," 
the student sa id . 

'There arc a lot of students in 
Iran who study hecause it is a sort 
of fig hting, a sort of positive light-
ing, sort of like Gandhi ," the stu-
den t said . "If the authori ties don 't 
let you get an educati on , if they 
don' t let you study, you wanl to 
show them that you can study." 

For a moment, 
imagine a world in 
which MeAT scores 
and GPAs do not 
count, where no 
matter how high you 
score on ·your 
entrance exam you 
are still not allowed 
to enter school. 

The BIH E opcratl:d so 4uietly 
that many Baha 'i orJiciab ahroad 
and many intell l!c tuais Within Imn 
were Ull<Iwar..: of it. Professor, ,ll 
Indian nive"ity rmvided COllrsc 
matcrial , and curricululll advice, 
and American Baha ' i, on visi ts 10 
Iran would carry suitcases ,tuffed 
wi th tcx thoob hought at th c 
Harvard Cn-or . 

Studen ts from all over the coun -
try were involved in th.:se indepen-
dent study courses. They had to 
work witho ut direct t.:acher con-
tact. The on ly way they could ta lk 

10 their teacher wa ' by writing a 
lell er, unless it was a very diffi cult 
course or it had a lab. 

"At the beginning of each 
semester we got assignments and 
notehooks, kind of like lab books, 
for writing to the teachers," a for-
mer studen t of the BIHE said. "We 
also got a list of hooks and where to 
buy them and what books we would 
need. Each week we had to com-
plete a certain amou nt of the book ." 

For the midterm exams, ~tu ­
dents would go to private homes to 
take the t e~ t. The exam would then 
he mai led hack to them. Many vo l-
unteers wcr..: invo lved 111 givi ng the 
test and then tak ing it hack to the 
tcacher. At the end of the semester 
they had the opportuni ty to have 
one tut orial pCI' c l a,~ . They would 
all L'omc to Tehran . the capital , and 
other Baha' i fam ilies wou ld host 
them . They wou ld ,tay with diff~r ­
ent Baha 'i fumilies lor a period of 
almo,t a month, and for evcry ,uh-
Jec t they had a day-long tutorial. 

It wa . .,n·t easy for the BIHE fac-
ulty mcmbers either. They didn ' t 
have offices and had to work out of 
their homes. But ultimately it was 
lunctlonal. hccau,e the teachers 
wen.: ge nerous, risking their own 
,ecuri ty to en~ure the education of 
dcprived studen ts. 

" II i~ an unhelievahle tragedy 
that ,w.:h hlatant di scrimination is 
going on over there at the Baha' i 
Open ni vc rsity," said Juli a 
Adame, director of Student Affai rs 
at UCSD. 

Approximately 150 stud.ent s 
ha ve graduated fro m the universi ty 

with bachelor's degrees. Some 
work in Iran, and others have con-
tinued their studies abroad , thei r 
degrees sometimes accepted 
despite the university'S lack of offi-
cial recognition. Bah a'i representa-
tives say that although the uni versi -
ty began in secret, the government 
became aware of it in the earl y 

1990~ and permitted it 10 conlinue. 
Unfortunate ly, Iran had to prove 

once aga in its power over and 
hatred of the Baha'i mi'noritie, in 
Iran. Members of the Baha'i Fai th , 
a religion that claims six million 
ad herents worldwide and 300,000 
in Iran (their largest minority), have 
heen facing v ici o u~ persel:ution 
si nce their inception in 1844. More 
than 200 Baha ' is werc killed in the 
early I ':n\O~ , right aher the Islamic 
Revo lut ion of I <nY, because of 
their religiuus helief~. Orten they 
were accu~ed 01 lictiti u~ crime~ 
and thousands haw , utTered arhi-

1998, when Mr. Ruhollah Rowhani

W..: a ,t ud.:nb need to lend a

Undcrgraduates majoring in the

No one likes to 
learn or hear about 
racial subjugation, 
but the reality is 
that experiencing 
subjugation and 
racism is a dull and 
at times sharp 
psychological pain 
for anyone, no 
matter what skin 
color, and in order 
to abate racism, 
society must deal 
with and learn about 
it. That is where 
ethnic studies 
comes into play. 

"Muny students aren't t!xposed 
to a variety of cu ltures." sa id David 
Goldsmith, a history major at 
Eleanor Roosevelt college. " II is 
signi fi cant in educating students 
ahout the world around them. It is 
imponant for curbi ng racism: ' 

------------~ 
ehool committees will not be 

impre sed by a sea ot' biology, com-
puter science or chemistry majors. 
They want a diverse array 01' people 
in their crew; therefore, it is a good 
idea to major in something other 
than the sciences. And if it pertains 
to relating to di I'fe rent cultures and 
ethn iei ti es, it is very impressive. 

Ethnic studies has been unfairly 
criticized for "white hashing." That 
is, that ethnic studi es tr.:ats whites 
as "the enemy" and ethnic minori-
ti es as vict ims. 

Raci 'm, however, persists; eth -
nic studies accurately educates stu -
dents about past and present dis-
crimination. No one likes to learn or 
hear about racial SUbjugation, hut 
I he reality is that experiencing sub-
jugation and racism is a sharp psy-
chological rain I'or anyone. 11 0 mal-

tcr the skin color. and in ordcr to 
abate racism, society must deal with 
and learn ahout it. That is where 
ethnic studies comes into play. 

Racism is a rea lity in America, a 
rea lity faced in ethnic studies, a 
reality at UCSD. John Pena, a tirst-
generation Mexican Ameri can, is a 
Warren st udent majoring in electri-
cal and computer engi nee ring. 
There is a problem in his life: 
racism. John Pena, along with 
many others, faces it everyduy 
when he walks along Library Walk 
and around the Price Center. 

"Asian and white people part 
away rrom me and from my 
Mexican hom les ," Pena sa id . 
"They give me the look . They think 
I am a gangster j ust hecau~e I wear 

Gett ing exposed to a vuriety or 
cultures is certainly a wuy of 
decreasing ignorance and thus less-
ening fear for cultural hahits that 
may seem alien. Goldsmith men-
tions. in li ght or globalization, that 
"as our world continues to shrink, 
allowing ig norance to fes ter 
hecomes increasingly dangerous." 

Ethnic studies prepares st udt!n ts 
for our "shrinking," muhi -cullllral 
world , lesse ning ignorance 
through education. II enuhles stu -
dents to succeed in an increasingly 
complt;;x and cosmopolitan envi-
ronment, while help ing to educat.:

DYNES BENDS ' OVER BACKWARD TO DENY RIGHTS 
Editor: 

My employer, hancellor 
Rohert Dyne~. has ~penl much lime. 
effort and money Iryi ng to deny me 
and other student el1l pl oye.:~ Iheir 
rights. He ha~ done ~o on the 
grounds that recognizing our righb 
as employee~ would interfere with 
our education. He is thu~ denying 
u, our rights. claiming to he acting 
in our own hest intc rcs t~! 

Thanks, but no thank ~ . 
AI a recent GSA meeting. Dynes 

explained that the reason he thinks 
granting us our right!. would inter-
fere with 'our education i~ hccause. 
in hi s own words, he ha, a "pen,on-
al prejudice" agai nst union~ . 

Dynes' views are in Ilat contra-
diction wilh the law. namely the 
California Higher Education 
Employer-Employee Relations Act 
(HEERA), which was spec ili cally 
created in order to promote "hanno-
niou ' and cooperative labor n.:la-
tions hetween the fluhlic instilUtions 
of higher education and their 
employees." The act further Mates 
that this purpose is to he achieved 
hy recognizing the ri ghl 01 .:mflloy-
ees to choose for them~lves who 
will reflrescnt them in their relation-
ship with Iheir employer. Such rep-
resentntion. far from gelling in the 
way of the university 's academic 
mission, is held to he nec.:ssary in 
order to fulfill that mission. 

Because of hi s antipathy toward 
unions, Chancellor Dynes has hent 
over hackward in order \() evade the 
purpose of Ihis law. He claims. 
rather um:onvincingly. Ihal , tudenl -
empl yecs are merdy students. and 

not "employee,." Clearly, we arc 
bOlh, and heing one docs not pre-
clude being the other. 

The law states that studen t-
em ployee, ,\re to be considered to 
have the ~ lalU~ of siudents if their 
work is primarily di rec ted toward 
fullilling Iheir "educalional objec-
ti ves." They arc to be considered 
"employees" i I' thei r work is of pri-
mary benclil to the uni versi ty. 

I am curre ntly employed as a 
Teaching Assistant at UCSD. I have 
hcen employed in this capacilY each 
quancr for fo ur straight years. the 
entire extent 01 my time here. At the 
risk of soundi ng immodest , I believe 
I h:lve perlormed and continue to 
perfoml a valuable service to the 
un iversity in courses that arc essen-
lialto its operation and reputation. as 
well a.~ to the 390 or so students who 
have hecn in my sections, whose 
papers and exams I have graded, and 
whose linal gradl:s I have a~sig ned . 

The work performed by TAs i ~ 
of enormous henelitto Ihe uni versi -
ty. The fact is that TAs arc rl:spon-
si hle for much of the teaching at 
UCSD. 

Without TAs, the uni versity 
would have to dramatically reorga-
ni ze itself. It would have to elimi-
nate large lecture courses, dramati -. 
cally reduce enrollment , and shift its 
emphasis from rcsean.: h to teaching. 

In contrast to this, teaching has 
in fact hampered. rather than helped 
me to achieve my educational 
ohjectives. which arc to complete a 
di ssenation and receive a Ph .D. 
None of the courses I have taughl

dissertation. And. ol:cau~e I have 
worked as a TA every quaner Ihal I 
have been al CSD. I have had ics, 
time to 'pend on my dissertation. 

I categorically deny (and resent) 
Ihe administration 's claim that I am 
not working as an emflloyee in my 
capacilY as a TA - that Ihe work I 
do teaching is of a greater bene lit to 
my own education than it is to Ihe 
education of my studen ts and to Ihe 
uni versity as a whole. 

Distinct from my educational 
ohjeclives <Ire my empl oyment 
objectives. which arc 10 supflon 
myself while in graduate schoo l. 
and 10 get a joh as a professor after 
I graduat~ . 

I am pleased to ,ay Ihat I like my 
job. Like the professors wi th whom 
I have worked, I have very much 
enjoyed working with ~tudents and 
have heneliled I rom my job In vari-
ou~ way~. 0 one dcnie~ these ob\ i-
ou~ bcm.:lits of employment. Thu~. 
dc~pite Ihe fact Ihatteaching gets in 
the way of my di,senation, I do it 
anyway, in part Ix!cause I enjoy it. in 
part hecall ~e it is a source of income, 
and in part because it will help l11e 
ge l a jo~ after I graduate. 

II i~ a henelit to me. but it i~ of 
primary hel1i.:lit to my cmpl oYl.!r. 
the Uni ve r,i ty of California. 
Chance llor Dynes' denial of thi ~ 
fact i ~ disi nge nuous and insulting. 

The administration is trying to 
portray Ihe upcoming ~trike as a ref-
erendum on the benelits of unions. 
It is not. The strike is aboul the right 
of emflloyees to be represented in 
co llective hargn ining hy representa-
tives of thei r choice. A majorilY of 
TA, on eac h C campus (over 500 
al UCSD and 4,700 sy,temwide), 
ha ve voted, 87 pl.!n:cnt in favor. to 
, trike 10 defend th is right. 

In addi tion, the UCSA. the sys-
temwide student government, 
which includes reflrcscntalives 
from hoth graduate and undergrad -
uate student councils on each cam-
pus, has passed an agenda indud-
ing full sUfl(X>r\ of the right s of all 
student-employees. The GSA and 
A.S. Counci l al UCS D have hoth 
vOled to approve thi s agenda it cm. 

As an assistant teacher employed 
by Ihis university, I ca ll on all non-
prej udiceo members of the universi -
ty co1l1munity 10 sUflport our_ri ghl a, 

student employee, to democratically 
select representatives of our choo~­
ing to represent us in our very real 
relalionship with our employer, who 
i, in tent on denyi ng us that right. 

With all due re 'pectto Chancellor 
Dyne~. we arc employees, taxpayer~ 
and adu h~, and arc capable of choQ!,-
ing for ourselves what is io our own 
best intere,ts. We don't need a li I' 
employer to do it for us.

not a lot of cu tting rema rks about the 
A.s. prc, idcnt , not too many tacky

Th b is why I was shocked to

Over the years. my GlllIrdiwl

SilKe 1995, when I first jOlnl!d the 
staff as a news reporter, I Iw ve met 
dozens of fumous people. including 
rot: k-and-ro ll iegend Otis Day 
(you've seen him in such lihm as 
"Animal Hou~e "). 

Last Friday, my impeccahle 
journali stic reputation came in 
handy when I landed an exclusive 
interview wi th the Guys Most Like-
ly To Make You Laugh. They' re 
vul gar. They 're rude . They di sre-
gard every social etiquette known 
to man (or woman). 

I wanted to know if the Koala guy were 
actually the bad-ass boys they have often 

portrayed themselves to be.

I'm referring to none other than 
infamous Koala staff members di -
tor-in- hief Spencer Yaras, hi s 
main hench man Tulley Raffe rt y 
and some guy from New Mexico 
who came along for the food . 

I was apprehensive about meet-
ing the masterminds behind the 
Guardiall 's rival puhlication, even 
though they seemed enthusiastic 
over the phone. They were almost 
too enthusiastic. For all I knew, 
they werc luri ng mc into an elabo-

("People writc to us about had-

failed attempt to start an all-l:am-
pus "Parcheesi Night." 

Call me unusuall y attracted 10 
the odd and perverse, but as the night 
went on I began to enjoy myse lf. The 
Koala staffers are an unusual bunch. 
For example, some of them bel iew 
that the life-sized cut-out of Fanio in 
their otlice window actually speaks 
to them. Also, they told me wild tales 
of being mobbed by female groupies 
in the supermarket. It wasn't dear 10 

told him I didn ' t know what "Cool 
as Icc" was. 

"Sec, Vanilla Ice made a movie 
and it was called 'Cool As Icc.' You

he plays a guy named Johnny who 
is very similar to Vanilla Icc in 
many ways. You' re watching it and 
it 's like, ' Dude, is he Johnny or is 
he like Vanilla Icc'!' I t '~ amal.ing l 
It 's like he's transformed." 

Sadly, Yaras will he leaving the 
Koala staff in Oeeemner to look for

Ju~t goes to show that underneath 
the 1110st innocent of exteriors can li e 
a seething mass of pent-up hostilit y. 

I was also surprised to learn that 
K(lu/a staffers actually don 't write 
their degrading and often hostil e 
personal ads. 

What intrigues me the most about 
the Koala guys is their unyielding 
commitment to fan jokes. 

"We don ' t deny that we do a 
ce rtain brand of humor," Yaras said. 
"IThe topic~ on our jokes remain 
net ween the knees and the waist, 
but that's the funniest reg ion of the 
body." 

Directed by 
Ste fan Novlnski 

I qu ickl y learned there wa, 
more 10 these jokers th an one- liner, 
about their favorite orilicl' . 

"Mon keys are funn y," Ralfcrty 
~aid . 

"Apes arc hilario us," Yaras 
ag rt:ed. " Pictures o r fat, naked 
wOlllcn. That 's comcdy. I'll give 
you list of things that are funny. 
Monkeys, ri ght o il th t: hat. 
Midgets. Pirates. Ninjas." 

Atthis point Raffel1y interrupted 
to bemoan the increasing scarcity of 
midgets. According to Ral'fc l1Y -
who is obvi ously the nrai ns of the 
operation - current medicill tech-
nology can "Ii x whatever it is that 
makes them midgets at childbirth ." 

And what or their rrequent ref-
erences 10 the dl1J g world? 

"Crack r coca ine J jokes arc on 
their way out ," Rafferty said. " We 
need an other drug that 's, like, 
ridi culously bad for yo u but that 
people sti II do for some bizarre rea-
son." 

"It 's not like you can just write 
dumb stuff," Yaras pointed out. 

" It 's a very delicate balance," 
RalTert y agreed. 

I wanted to know if the Koala 
guys were actually the bad-ass

THE EDITOR'S SOAPBO 
The personal testimonial 0.[ a recovering television addict 

LEENA SHANKAR 
Nell 'S Eaito }' 

I cannot helie e the path that my 
exi stence has taken. If I had been 
told that I would li ve like thi s even 
three years ago. I would have faint -
ed with di sbelief. Never did I imag-
ine that co llege would mean life 
withouttcievision - yes. I know it 
sounds odd, nerdy or .:ven a liut..: 
perve rse but I don ' t watch telev i-
sion anymore. 

The hanit started when I was a 
child. Having always been an earl y 
riser, I loved Saturday mornings 
when the cartoons started at 6 a.m. 
A bi g howl of Lucky Charms 
would round out my mornin g 
which featured shows such "Gem," 
"Transformers:' "Snorks," 
"Smurfs," "Voltron," "Scooby-
000." "Gu mmi Bcars," "Care 
Bears," "Johnny Quesl." "Inspector 
Gadget" - well , you get the idea. 

The lirst thing I did when I 

carne home each day from elemen-
ta ry school was tum on the TV to 
watch "Alvin and the Chipmunks," 
'Three's Company," "Charles In 
Charge." "Who's the Boss?", "Di f-
ferent Strokes," and "Sil ver 
Spoons." 

I honestly fe lt that m)' furth -
grade teacher was a cruel mother 
because she put the fan.ily televi -
sion :Iway in a closet, preventing 
her two-year-old daughter from 
evcn experiencing the simple plea-
sure of "Sesame Street." I made my 
mother promise that she would 
never do that to me and my brothel'. 

Junior high was the age of 
··MacGyver." That show mn my 
pre-adolescent life lIlost likely 
because I believed. in my 13-year-
old mind, that MacGyve r was the 

hunki ~stman ever. In high school, I 
was busy but [ still made time for 
"Lois & Clark ," "ER" and ' 'The 
Simpsons," and lots of made ror-
TV movies. 

Now, don ' t get me wrong. I was 
always a good student, played on 
nasketball teams, ran track, worked 
on the school newspaper and year-
hook, volunteered, participated in 
student government and mock tri -
als, and went out wilh my friends 
nearly every weekend. However, 

as 
for 

00 

I never imagined 
that I wouldn't have 
a TV when the time 
came for me to 
leave for college. I 
always saw myself 
as one of those 
college students 
who decided their 
schedule around 
"Price Is Right" or 
some other show. 
But bringing a 
television down to 
UCSD in my 
freshman year was 
just not practical. 
telev ision was my secret addicti on. 
I doubt anybody except for Illy 
fami Iy knew just how many hours 
llfTV I managed to squeeze in each 
day. 

I never imagined that I wouldn ' t 
have a TV when the time callle for 
lIle III leave for college. I always 
saw myself as one of those college 

student s who dc~ ided their sched-
ule around ·'Pri.e Is Right" or some 
other show. But bringing a telev i-
sion down to UCSO in Illy fresh-
man year was just not practical. My 
parents, probably fearing wi th-
drawal ~y mptoms, agreed to a new 
computer which also had a TV 
luner card so that I could maintain 
my habit by watching television on 
my computer. 

However, once [ got to college, I 
found myself watching a randolll 
HBO movie or Laker gamc but lit-
tle cl se . Somehow. I just didn ' t 
have time. was too embarrassed to 
he scen watching hours of televi -
sion a day and ended up kicking the 
habit. When I moved into an apart -
ment wi t h my three closest UCS 0 
friend s, none of us even talked 
ahout who was bringing a TV -
proof that TV is no longer an inte-
gral part of my lire. We ha ve a cute 
littie black-and-white in the ramily 
room; it has ahout li ve or six chan-
nels which can be changed by a 
dial. 

I have fou nd that life is not hor-
rihk and tortuous wi thout min(jless 
entertainment after a ll . Leisure 
ti mc doesn' t mean channel surling 
or watching beautiful people act 
out implausible lives. Late night 

conyer ':uions with my roommatcs 
are so much more s.lIisfyin£ and 
real than watching Jay Leno or 
David Letterman blab on late-night 
TV. I' ve always enjoyed reading 
periodicals and now, if I want to 
take a break from reality, I read my 
magaz ines or the newspaper. Col-
lege has been my 12-stcp program 
for gelling olT TV. 

There are so many other ac ti vi-
tic, to panicipate in .md if nothing 
else, the weather is so beautiful that 
I can ' t bring myself to stay indoors 
just to slarc at a screl:ll. 

I will probably always ensure 
that [ have access to television in 
case ( want to watch the news as it 
happens. And it might be nice to 
have at leasl a small television in 
case some stlltion decides to rerun a 
"MacGyver" episode or two!

Feisty Tritons Fencing Well 
ADVERSITY: UCSD has withstood a bevy of early-season challenges 
By Travis Hill 
Associate Sports Editor 

Here's a word no one likes to 
hear: adversil Y. 

In the sports community, the 
term basil:u lly means that the wo rld 
is dumping on your team. Any usc 
of the word usually signals Ihat 
your team is not going tn be very 
good. 

But it is poss ible to overcome 
adve rsi ty. The teams wi th the 
grea test strength of character have 
the abi lity to overw me the many 
obstacles a season wi II brinl!. 

The UC 0 fendng Icam has 
been strugg ling all season, aft cr 
loosing All -American Jam:t Wert/. 
to graduati on and suffering injuries 
and eligibi lity questions. Needless 
to say, the Tritons have had a grea t 
dea l of advers ity to ovcn .. 'Qlllc. 

At their latest tournament, how-
eve r, the Tritons proved that they 
still know how 10 win . The squad 
managed to raise ils record to 3-2 '

II.'''8ASKETBALL I after their 

Before the 
),ea~on , Head oach Judy 
Malone's veteran squad had 
hll!h hopes. But in the season open-
er, the team was trounced by the 

niversity of Sl. Th mas (Minn.), 
75-47. SD h k off Ih loss 
thi s weekend with a 65-50 victory 
over Bethel ollege f Minnesota, 
but then dropped a tough one 10 
heated-rival California Lutheran 

niver 'ily ( al Lu), 67-55 . 
The Thank giving break was 

loss to SI. 
Thomas. 
Despite the fact that the 

Tritons were searching for redemp-
tion, they could not shake Bethel 
early. The Tritons were obviously 
the better team, but Bethel was no 
slouch. At the half, SD was up 
by a not-quite-comfortable 25-20 
lead. 

]n the 'econd half, however, 
U D took over. Malone was get-
ting production from everywhere, 

as her bench proved to be very 
solid . But it was her starters that 
led the way. Amy McClure and 
Tristen Teasdale led the Tritons 
wi th II poi nt s each. while Kate 
Turnbull added 10 points and a 
team-leading 7 rebounds. 

Th Tritons ended up dancing to 
an easy IS-point win , 65-50, as II 
different Tritons scored. It was a 
good victory for the Tritons, m re 
for their psyche than their rec rd. 

The roller coa. ter took an unex-
pected drop the n 'xt night , howev-
er. The weary Trit ns had to travel 
to Thou and Oak ' for a contest 
against rival Cal Lu. Malone had 
tried to 'pread the minutes in the 
previous night 's game because she 
knew she was in for a war. 

The Tritons were playing tough 
early, and both teams were tied at 9. 
But al Lu broke the tie and stole 

the momentum. The Regab rattled 
off a 27- 16 run to end the lirst hal f 
and as the ti red Tritons entered the 
IO<.:ker room, they were down, 36-25. 

But there was nu quit in the 
Tritons. They came out in the sec-
ond half and would not be pushed 
around. Malone's squad was ·tand-
ing up to the Regals, and was being 
led by an unlikely hero: reserve 
Genevieve Ruvald. Ruvald had 
been one of the top bench players, 
but no one knew she would explode 
for 15 points in 22 minutes. he 
finished as U SD' leading s<.:orer, 
but the lirst-half lead was too mu<.:h 
for the Tritons to overcome. 

The Tritons fell to 1-2 on the 
sea on with the 67-55 lo · ~ . The 
team will try to even things out on 
the road when it travels to Point 
Lama for a battle with the 

rusaders thi aturday.
