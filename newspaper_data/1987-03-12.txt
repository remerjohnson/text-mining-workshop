SDSU student editor 
wins court case 

A federal Judge luled Monday 
that a tate univerSity policy 
requiring that editorial 
endorsements of political 
..:andidates and propositions be 
Igned by their authors , Infnnges 

on the first Amendment free 
speech rights of college 
newspaper editors. 

R. Andrew Rathbone, editOr of 
. he an Diego State's Daily Mil: , 
was suspended from hiS edItorial 
post for a day after he openly 
disobeyed the poltcy by 
publishing unsigned editorial 
endorsements before the 
'ovember general ele uon . 

U .. Dlsm tJudge Edward 
Schwartz ordered the suspension 
set aSide and ruled that the 
umverslty's interests did not 
outweight Rathbone's First 
Amendment nghts. 

Gregory Marshall , legal dIrector 
of the San Diego chapter of the 
Amencan CIvil LIberties Union 
and Rathbone's attorney, said the 
ruling indicates that student 
newspapers have the same basic 
speech and press nghts that any 
other pubhcatlon has despite the 
fact that the state contributes 
some financing to some college 
newspapers. 

Attorneys for the state argued 
that by requiring edItorial 
endorsements to be signed , 
readers would not mistakenly 
belteve they reflected the 
oplntons of the untversity or the 
state 

Schwanz said that it IS 
typically impossible to confuse 
student editor's opInions with 
those of the University'S 
administra tion. 

The Judge also rejected the 
umversity's argument that ItS 
policy helped it comply WIth the 
state law prohlblUng the 
spending of state funds or 
student fees to support 
candIdates or ballot proposl!lons.

Radioactivity detected 
in UCSB classroom 

Campus officials at uc Santa 
Barbara removed radioactive steel 
rods from an An HIStory building 
basement after above-normal 
levels of radiation were detected 
in a first floor classroom. 

The chemical and nuclear 
engineering depanment used the 
basement to store low-level 
radIOactive mateTlals for more 
than five years before the 
department moved to another 
complex 

A shipment of madlated steel 
"specimens" triggered an 
Increase In radiauon levels that 
eventually led to the detection of 
.14 milhrems/ hour In a nearby 
classroom. The level detected is 
below the .20 millirems/ hour 
legal hmlt, but above a .02 
milhrems/ hour background level 
that exists naturally 

The radioactive materials were 
temporaTlly relocated to a 
shielded contamer in an 
Engmeering building. 

The professors who teach In 
the classrooms involved were nor 
told that radlOactlve materials 
were bemg stored beneath them. 

According to the Radiation 
Protection olftce, a branch of 
Environmental Health and Safety, 
the low radiation levels detected 
were no cause for alarm. 
UC found to have 
high crime level 

The UniverSity of California's 
nine campuses are among the 
nations's most cnme ridden , 

NI/W, 

according to the CommIssIon on 
CalifornIa tate Government 
Organlzatlon and Economy. 

There were 299 rapes, assaults, 
and murders reported In 1985 
on UC campuses according to 
Nathan -hapell , chairperson of 
the commIssion. 

hapell saId that UC Berkeley 
was ranked o. one in a 
natlonwlde study of campus 
cTlme Issued last year. 

U ntVCrslty offiCIals have 
dIsputed hapell's statlstics. UC 
Berkeley ofTlcials say that their 
statistics are disproportionately 
high because they Include 
incIdents that occurred ofT 
campus. 

The UniverSIty currently 
allocates 'tt 2 million of its ~6 
billion annual budget to protect 
ItS 147 ,000 students. 

Shapell said that outSIde urban 
youth gangs were panially 
reponsible for the increased 
campus violence. 

According to the repon , 
Berkeley had four rapes, twO 
attempted rapes, 18 armed 
robberies, 31 aggravated assaults, 
and 69 minor assaults such as 
fistfights . 

In contrast, UC D had one 
rape, no auempted rapes, one 
armed robbery, three aggravated 
assaults and 18 minor assaults. 

Three students 
awarded scholarships 

Three students m Electrical 
Engmeering and Computer 
SCiences at UCSD have been 
awarded scholarships by the 
Burroughs/System Development 
Corp. 

The company awarded $2,000 
scholarshIps to twO students, 
Eltzabeth A Walkup, a junior 
from Torrance, CaM .. and David 
M Baylon, a Junior from San

SAAC outreach 
progranntotarget 
'feeder schools' 
By LETIOA CRUZ VILlARREAL. Scaff Wnw 

T HE Associared Students External SAAC Outreach Program had its first organizational meeting March 4 at 3 pm in the multi-purpose room of the Student Cenrer. 
About 35 people attended the rrtandatory meeting, among them 

members of the Revelle Third World Alliance, the Third College 
Student Council, and several minority students. Associated Student 
(AS.) Vice-President External Enc Weiss, the program's sponsor, 
was happy with the large turnout, since he saw one of the goals of 
the program as "instilling enthusiasm among (UCSD) students 
about the extracurricular benefits of attending UCSD." 

A more important goal of the External SAAC Outreach Program, 
according to Weiss, is that the administration "obviously has not 
been very successful" in recruiting high school students from 
disadvantaged areas - the main target group of this SAAC program. 

"Hopefully," Weiss said, "it will cause Ithe administration] to 
reflect on their [recruitment] techniques and take a more creative 
approach." Weiss hopes that the "student-to-student" approach of 
the program will become "a model for other AS. governments to 
begin a low-cost and positive program to encourage disadvantaged 
student enrollment" at colleges and universities. The program aims 
to recruit student volunteers to go to high schools with peer-
oriented presentations directed at the ethnic background, age, and 
economic level of their audience. This approach is, according to 
Weiss, "a lor more credible than a fat-cat administrator from UCSD 
going to tell [disadvantaged high school students] what to do." 

The program will focus on "feeder" schools (high schools 
generally in proximity to UCSD from which the university has a 
responsiblitiy to recruit), schools in depressed areas, and schools 
with a high percentage of minority and disadvantaged students. 

Weiss acknowledged that with the higher UC admissions 
standards coming into effect, the program could be sending a 
conflicting message to high school seniors who may not be 
admitted into the UC system because of low grade point averages 
which they will obviously have no time to improve. Weiss pointed 
out, however, that the program does not aim solely to attract 
students to the UCs but to other coUeges and to the idea of highrer 
education in general. Because of the GPA factor, Weiss hopes to 
target "younger kids who will have a chance to improve their 
grades." 

Weiss sees the program as a positive response to the "dramatic" 
decrease of underrepresented students attending UCSD. 

The estirrtated yearly budget of the program is $5260. This 
estirrtation includes the cost of brochures, transportation, UCSD 
painters' caps, and a manager salary, among other things. IC:iJ

UC budget slips in and out of dire straits 
By j.W. AKERS-SASSAMAN, Capitol Correspol1dent 

SACRAMENTO, UC Wire -
Proposals to cut the University of 
California's budget by $38.5 
million . reduce the number of 
graduate students and decrease 
funding for research programs 
were rejected yesterday by an 
Assembly subcommittee that later 
rulocated an additional $250,000 
to improve the quality of 
undergraduate education , 

we should go with his original 
number," said Hayden , who 
backed improvt:ments in 
Smelser's report. 

The Smelser Report, named for 
the UC Berkeley professor who 
headed the university's study to 
improve the quality of 
undergraduate education , calls 
for a variety of improvements in 
TA training, with particular 
attention to language skills. 

accepted stud ents who actually 
attend the university, are 
responsible for the 
overenrollment. 

"Predicting enrollment is an 
art , nOt a science." said UC 
Berkeley Chancellor Ira Heyman, 
and in years past, the universiry 's 
inaccurate predic tions have led 
to underenrollment. 

After U.c. agreed to the study, 
but nOt the funding restriction , 
the subcommittee sided with the 
university and allocated the 
money. Proposals for more 
research projets met a mixed 

fate. 
Although the subcommittee 

approved the spending of an 
aditional $250,000 for PaCific 
Rim studies, they postponed 
action on a proposal to increase 
funding for toxic research by 
';500,000 follOWing charges of 
inaction by Hayden. 

"I think this program could be 
more effective. 1 agree there 
should be more attention (given 
to toxic wastes), but this appears 
like we're just throwing money at 
the problem ," said Hayden, the 
prinCipal author of the anti-

toxics Proposition 65 on last 
November's ballot. The 
subcommittee also rejected a 
proposal to withhold ~ 1 m ilion 
for further efforts to attract the 
proposed Superconducti ng 
Supercollider to California. 

Other states trying to attract 
the project. which, a UCLA study 
sta tes, would enrich the state's 
cofTers by approximately $750 
mIllion by the tum of the 
century, have spent conSiderably 
more money, Hayden said . "It's a 
crap game. If you don't pay, you 
don 't play," Hayden said. ~ 

The university and Assistant 
Legislative Analyst Floyd Marshall 
squared off before an Assembly 
Ways and Means subcommittee. 
When the dust had settled, U.c. 
had ''won a few and lost a few, 
but come out ahead ," said Larry 
Hershman, UC Director of the 
Budget. 

The increase drew praIse from 
UC ofTicials, including Vice 
President William Frazier, who 
said he was "grateful that UC's 
efforts (to improve undergraduate 
education) were being well 
received." 

The subcommittee rejected a 
proposal to postpone $1.2 
million in funding next year for 
258 graduate students the 
Legislative Analyst believes 
exceed enrollment maximums. 
Hill wanted the California 
Postsecondary Education 
Commission, a non-panisan 
body that examines higher 
education matters for the state , 
to review graduate enrollment 
levels and faculty workioads 
before the state paid for the 
increased number of graduate 
students. 

UCD study stresses gun control 
Legislative Analyst Elizabeth 

Hill's proposal to allocate 
$500,000 to enhance the quality 
of undergraduate education by 
improving 'he training of TAs 
was warmly received by the 
subcommittee, who increased the 
allocation by $250,000 to allow 
for increased supervision of TAs 
by academic departments. 

By J,W. AKERS-SASSAMAN, Capitol CorrespondellC 

"Nothing is more important 
than improving the quality of 
undergraduate education ," said 
Assemblymember Tom Hayden, 
D-Santa Monica, who proposed 
the ';250,000 increase. "Professor 
(Neil ) Smelser origmaUy urged 
the allocation of $750,000 (the 
figure was reduced by the UC 
Board of Regents), and I th ink 

Hershman said factors beyond 
the university's control, including 
more students spending more 
time and an unexplained 
increase in the number of

SACRAMENTO, UC Wire -
Guns have become California's 
eighth leading cause of death , 
and 95 percent of the kiUings are 
intentional, according to UC 
Davis researchers, whose 7 year 
study concluded that firearms 
control is the solution. 

Of 26,442 gunshot deaths in 
the sta~e between 1977 and 
1983, 48 percent were suicide, 
and 47 percent were murder and 
JUSt 3 percent were aCCidental , 
according to the study released 
by doctors at the UCD Medical 
Center in Sacramento. The 
causes of death for the 
remaining 2 percent could not 

be determined . 
The stud y, published m the 

March issue of the Western 
Journal of MedICine revealed that 
firearms were the major factor in 
homicide deaths and the number 
one cause of death from suicide. 

Some 84 percent of those 
killed by guns were male , the 
study found . Firearms were the 
leading cause of death among 
black males in the 15-34 age 
group. 

In fact, the study states, the 
gunshot death rate for Blacks -
both male and female - was as 
much as 10 times greater than 

for other raCIal groups. 
Doctor Garen Wmtemute , co-

author of the study, which was 
based on death cert ificates said 
that, "If only 3 percent of 
fi rearms deaths are accidental, 
safety education won't improve 
the situation much." 

Wlntemute , a family 
practitioner who contends that 
he did not set out to reinforce 
any particular point of view, said 
government should "reduce the 
availabIlIty of firearms, make 
them more difTicult to obtain,

Beating t4e bicycle/ pedestrian batde 
By NAOMI FABER 

It's 9:50 am, I've just woken 
up, and I have a 10 o'clock class. 
I rush out of my apartment and 
try to get to class before it ends. 
I'm at the Third Apartments and 
I have to get to Revelle Plaza in 
five minutes. It doesn't look 
promising as I try to get through 
the massive crowds of srudent 
on the crowded pathways during 
the early morning rush. I think 
I'm making good time and then, 
all of a sudden, there it is .. 
swoosh, SCREECH, watch Out! 
The early morning bikers are 
rushing to class as well. 

Trying to get to class IS like 
being in a pinball machine, 
where the bikers are the pinballs 
and the pedestrians are the 
bumpers. Trymg to stay OUI of 
the way of people riding bicycles 
is a constant struggle . I'm rushing 
to class, bumping into people, 
Jumping Out of the way of 
bicycles, and by the time I get to 
class I'm frazzled. Besides being 
ten minutes late for class, I Just 
barely avoided three bike 
collisions . .. what a way to start 
the day. 

Bike riders at UCSD pose a 
serious threat on campus 
pathways. There IS a big problem 
with the number of aCCidents 
and "near misses" caused by 
bikers. The pathways here are 
nm very big and when there are 
so many students going to class 
they become very crowded. It is 

hard enough to dodge running 
students, let alone bikers 
zooming by at high speeds. 
Walking around campus has 
become unsafe. If you are not the 
one being hit, or the one falling 
off the bike, then you are most 
likely one of the ones being 
stopped in the crowd by an 
accident up ahead . The 
pathways are not wide enough 
for students and bike riders 
together. 

One way to solve this problem 
would be to widen the paths 
here at UCSD. If Widened , there 
would be more space for bikers 
and pedestrians as well. There 
wouldn't be as many accidents 
because students could easily get 
out of the way of students on 
their bikes. Also, there would not 
be overcrowding on the paths 
and people could get to class on 
time. The problem with this 
proposal is that UCSD has more 
and more students enrolled every 
year. With more srudents, the 
pathways become more crowded 
and more bikers are riding 
around. Eventually the widened 
paths won't be wide enough and 
the same problem will arise. 
Th is, therefore, is not a practical 
solution . 

Another alternative would be 
nm to allow bikes on campus. 
Obviously, if there were no bikes 
the problem would no longer 
eXIst. Students LOuld walk 

around campus without b~ing 
worried about being mowed 
down by a bike. Although this 
would solve the problem of 
accidents, it would cause many 
more problems. Students depend 
on their bikes. Bikes are a basic, 
and often the only, means of 
transportation for some. They 
provide a way to get to school 
and a way to get from class to 
class. If bikes were not allowed 
on campus, people would have 
to find another means of 
transportation . This would be 
costly to many, and cause a lot 
of irritation . Therefore, the 
banning of bikes on campus is 
nowhere near a feasible solution 
and disregarded . 

The best proposal to solve this 
problem is to put in bike lanes at 
UCSD. It will do everything 
needed to solve the problem 
without causi ng any new ones. If 
bike lanes were painted in, there 
would be a separation between 
pedestrians and bikers. Bike 
lanes would be on either side of 
the pathway, in both directions. 
They would be on the main path 
through UCSD, from Third 
College to Revelle. Srudents on 
their bikes could stay in thier 
lanes, while students on fom 
could stay in theirs. Also, 
skateboarders would stay in the 
bike lanes, as they cause 
problems with pedestrians like 
bikers do. The bikers could go 
faster in their lanes without 

REAGAN STUDIES THE TOWER REPORT 

scaring, or possibly hurting, the 
people on foot. The crowding 
would not be as great since 
people could walk smoothly 
without having to dodge 
speeding bikes. 

There would have to be 
enforcement of these lanes to 
make them work . If a campus 
officer sees a pedestrian in the 
bike lanes, or a pedestrian in the 
bike lanes, the offending party 
would be cited. The people will 
stay in their lanes and the 
problems from before the bike 
lanes will be avoided. The cost of 
this is nothing outrageous. 

Actually it is quite reasonable . 
Granted it is not free, but the 
price is worth all the problems 
and inconveniences it will save . 

The proposal to put bike lanes 
in at UCSD is a feasible one. It 
will solve the problem of 
accidents and proVide a safe, 
quick way to get to class. This 
solution is easy to do and 
affordable. Everyone benefits 
from it and there are no bad 
consequences. I think that other 
students will agree that this is 
the answer, and it should be 
acted upon soon.

1532; five years after Machiavelli 
died. (Gosh, he didn't even get 
to see the reviews). One of the 
things that really pisses people 
off about Big Mach is that much 
of what he says is true. Consider, 
for example, the political advice 
he seems to personally address 
to our own Prince Ronnie: 

"It now remains for us to 
consider what ought to be the 
conduct and bearing of a 
(president) in relation to his 
subjects and friends. And since I 
know that many have wrinen on 
this subject, I fear it may be 
thought presumptuous in me to 
write of it also: the more so, 
because in my treatment of it I 
depart from the views that others 
have taken. 

"But since it is my object to 
write what shall be useful to 
whosoever understands it, it 
seems to me bener to follow the 
real truth of things than an 
imaginary view of them. (My 
sentiments exactly) .. . 

Beginning, then ... I say it may 
be a good thing to be reputed 
generous, but, nevertheless, that 
generOSity without the ~putation 
of it is hurtful; ... 

"A (president) should disregard 
the reproach of being thought 
cruel where it enables him to 
keep his subjects united and 
obedient. For he who quells 
disorder by a very few Signal 
examples will in the end be 
more merciful than he who from 
too great leniency permits things 
to take their course and so to 
result in rapine and bloodshed; 
for these hurt the whole State, 
whereas the severities of the

a good color on this nature, and 
to be skiUfull in simulating and

and always found material to

more effective manner to

"And you are to understand 
that a (president), and most of

(party's power), to act in 
opposition to good faith , charity , 
humanity, and religiun . He must 
therefore keep his mind ready to 
shift as the winds and tides of

have already said, he ought not 
to qUit good courses if he can 
help it, but should know how to 
follow evil courses if he must ...

Frat fright 
Editor: 

I am a member of the Sigma 
Alpha Mu Fraternity and I am 
writing this to express my 
outrage at the deplorable actions 
of the Tau Kappa Epsilon 
Fratemity. Their actions have 
been the subject of news stories 
in newspapers, on radio, and on 
major television sta tions in San 
Diego and Los Angeles. The 
repercussions of these 
irresponsible actions will be felt 
by all members of the Greek 
Community here at UCSD, and 

the memory will loom like a dark 
cloud over our heads for years to 
come. 

It is a common practice to 
rent several hotel rooms after a 
major social event (suc h as a 
semi-formal or a formal). This 
does in fact have a very practical 
purpose; it provides a safe place 
for an after-party where paniers 
who are too drunk or toO tired 
can spend the night without 
drivi ng home and risking a car 
accident. The Tekes rented 
several rooms at the La Jolla 

Marriol with a different purpose; 
excessive rowdiness , drugs and 
massive destruction . This 
resulted in criminal charges 
being filed against several of the 
members, and a possible (if not 
probable ) laWSUit by the Marriot 
against the Tekes. 

Don't get me wrong, I am not 
a prude. I love to have fun at 
panies, but I also realize that 
when I go to a party I am 
rcsponslble for my actions. Any 
lack of this type of respo nslblity 
not only makes me look bad, but 

makes the fraternity (as a whole) 
look bad as well. The actions of 
the Tau Kappa Epsilon 
Fraternity. UCSD Chapter, re/lect 
a horrible image on aU 
fraternitie at UCSD 

The fratcrnities of San Diego 
State University are judged in a 
bad light because of the actions 
of several members of the PI 
Kappa Alpha Fraternity. The 
image of fraternities as a whole 
is destroyed al SDSU because of 
the Irrcspon~lble actions of a 
handful of frats . The image of 

fraternities at UCSD is now 
greatly diminished because of a 
few frats who aren't 
representative of the ideals of all 
fralernities . 

When I went to IFC Info 
Night, one basic theme ran true: 
all fraternities are different, and 
that what's so special about 
them. T ekes don't represent 
Sammies, or Phi Delts or Delta 
Sigs, or Zebes, or any other 
fraternity for that matter. But 
now, we 'll all be judged on the

I may seem anti-Iekes, but I'm 
not. I am not prejudiced against 
the Iekes in any way, As a 
matter of fact, my father was a

Just because I'm a Sammy doesn't

I do hate is the bad Ught that

for a long time to come, 

Sigma Alpha Mu prides Itself 
on a tradition that aids in the

result in actlons nch in 
manhood: responsibili ty, 
maturity, morality, democracy, 
and humanity. Projecting these 
ideals to prospective rushees will 
be diffi cult come spring because 
of the fraternities poor image.

slap on the wrist. A clean break 
here will allow the OIher

recently regarding the current 
situation in icaragua, Some of 

the 10dividuals suppOrt current 
U.S, policy which gives mllitaty 
aid to the Contras; others believe 
the current policy should be 
discontinued in support of the 
governing Sandanistas. Often 
these leners quote certain fa ts

with OIher quoted facts. Often 
the individuals resort to name

individuals are vety passionate 
about the issues, and often it 
becomes dilTicult to talk to them. 
From the knowledge I have 
gamed it is difficult for me to 
completely support one side or 
the other. Obviously, there are a 
great deal of what I consider to 
be wrong-doings on the part of

differing philosophies, We live 
in a "democratic" SOciety in 
which the majority of the

who is the majority in

so divided, should this majority

both sides of the argument. The

The final product is not yet

its structural integrity and ability

conditions will be tested, This is 
also where some albacore tuna 
will be scooped out of the sea 
and tested so that they will not 
be bothered by being out of their 
natural element for long periods 
of time. 

unveiled at Scripps Of the many technical 
problems that arose while 
building the seven ton machine 
(with water), one of the trickiest 
was ensuring a smooth flow of 
water through the swimming 
secnon , where the fish does its 
thing. If there are any currents, 
the fish has no room to adjust, 
and will not be able to swim 
properly, if at all. Dr. Graham 
likened that situation to "a 
(people) treadmill with big lumps 
in it," and called the desired flow 
a "unified front" of water. This is 
made even more difficult by the 
need to have variable water 
speed, and , along with all the 
other problems, took more than 
seven years to satisfactorily solve.

much larger fish than could condl,tlons anywhere 10 the 
previously be studied, world s oceans. They can 

measure blood pressure, heart 
rate, oxygen consumption, and 
body temperature. "In order to 
do this", said Graham, 'we have 
to put instruments in him: first 
we anesthetize the fish, (then 
insert the probes), then we put 
him through the experiments: 

Dr. Jeffrey Graham, a research 
physiologist, designed and built 
the machine, and was assisted 
by Chin Lai , a graduate student 
at Scripps, and Bill Lowell, a 
technician at that institution, 

"Previously", said Dr. Graham, 
"you could go to Home Depot (a 
hardware store), make a nineteen 
dollar investment, and put 
together a water tunnel in an 
afternoon. For forty years it was 
like this, but the problem was 
that the largest fish that could be 
studied was 16 inches, until 
now." 

The original impetus for 
creating a large water tunnel, in 
this case one that caters to fish 
up to 40 inches in length, was 
the humble albacore tuna. Since 
tuna is an important pan of the 
fishing industry, It is convenient 
for tuna fishermen to know 
where their catch is likely to be, 
if not exactly where it is, in 
order to catch as many as 
possible. 

The information thus gathered 
on the fish being studied can be 
used to figure out what kind of 
habitat that species prefers, and 
what effects changes in the 
ocean, man-made or natural, will 
have on that species, 

The possible location of runa 
is especially tough to predict 
because it is warm-blooded, a 
rarity under the sea, and its muscle 
tissue is more efficient the 
warmer it is. "Therefore: Graham 
said, "the tuna is one of the most 
powerful and fastest swimmers in 
the ocean. The warm-
bloodedness may also be the 
reason it can absorb five to ten 
times as much oxygen as other 
fish species. The factors combine 
give the tuna a vast range of 

living conditions to choose from , 
and they are present throughout 
the Pacific Ocean," 

As Dr, Edward A. Frieman, the 
director of Scripps, noted , the 
tuna industry supported Dr. 
Graham 's research, and in 
particular, helped raise the 
money to keep Chin Lal on as 
Dr. Graham's graduate student. 
The San Diego Center for Sports 
and Commercial Fishmg also 
assisted with the research. 

Assemblyman Larry Stirling, 
representing the 77th district, 
which encompasses Scripps and 
UCSD, authored the Marine 
Fisheries Enhancement Act, and 
has an abiding interest in the 
creatures of the sea, Recognizing 
that many people are starving in 
the world, he praised the 
researchers saying that "the work 
in San Diego is making 
incredible contributions toward 
research" to alleviate the lack of 
sufficient food for all , 

It was not, however, a tuna 
that occupied the place of honor 
during the unveiling of the water 
tunnel, because tuna do not 
survive long in captivity. 

Chin Lai , Dr. Graham's 
graduate student assistant, noted 
that greenjacks and yellowtails 
have been the best treadmill 
subjects so far, "The leopard 
shark is the best shark for this 
[type of! study," said Lai, and it 

It is this portability which 
makes the respirometer so useful, 
not only for studying tuna but 
other fish as well, This, along 
with the other engineering feats 
incorporated into the water 
tunnel respirometer, validated Dr. 
Frieman's description of it as a 
"natural resource," and of Dr, 
Graham as both "a first grade 
biologist and a first grade 
engineer. IZ:l 

SIO's water tunnel respirometer can recreate conditions inherent in any of the 
world's oceans.

Visiting Prof lends her originality to UCSD 
By LISA QUINTANA 

ALTHOUGH many UC D's wnnng professors are published authors . 
Fanny Howe IS clearly not your 
average professor. 

A Visi ti ng scaff member from 
the Massachusetts Ins titute of 
Tech nology (MIT), Howe is also 
well-known in the avant-garde 
and contemporary literature 
circles. Her published works 
include 10 novels. four of which 
are aimed towards teenagers, a nd 
numerous poems regularly 
printed in poetry magazines. 
Howe finished her latest novel 
last February, entitled Famous 
QuestiOns, dealing with the subject 
of marriage . 

Although writing novels is 
more lucrative, Howe prefers ~ 

finanCial situation has looked 
grim, she has taken to writing 
books for the younger set 
"Usuall}' I get from between 

~3,000 to 1£7,000 for each, and it 
only takes me SIX to nine weeks 
to finish one." For th is rea on, 
she would like to see more 
wnting student s a ttempting this 
genre if they Wish for 
commerical success. With her 
poetry, it IS much more personal. 

Howe admits that she was not 
the average student , "I was 
terrible . I was kicked out of 
Junior high ." The precocious 
Howe had mastered the an of 
ventriloquism, "I threw my voice 
into the teacher and had her say 
somethi ng obscene ." 

When Howe applied to 

Howe had mastered the art of 
ventriloquism; til threw my voice into the

write poetry because "more of 
myself is engaged ," compared to 
her fiction writing where "the 
story comes from outer space 
and JUst passes through me like 
I'm some kind of receiver." 

Teachi ng is an imponant pan 
of Howe's hfe , though writing 
WIll always come first. Her 
grandmother, of the same name. 
staned the trend , and Howe's 
mother and her younger sister 
Susan are also pubhshed writers. 
Susan Howe is well-known for 
her avant-garde and 
expenmental poetry; much of her 
work IS covered In poetry 
courses here at UCSD. 

In the past , when Howe's 

colleges, she found that "nobody 
wanted me ." Finally, her father, a 
professor at Harvard , caDed up a 
fnend at Stanford and managed 
to get his daughter admitted. 
However, in the middle of her 
third year, she quite school and 
eloped . The mamage lasted only 
twO years . She has never 
received a college degree. 

When asked how the students 
at UCSD differ from those of 
MIT, Howe responded that the 
later are "less sophisticated ... 
and undeTdeveloped SOCially as a 
group ." UCSD has "bener wmers. 
[Wnnng] pieces are broadeT and 
more comtemplative." Teaching 

Mission Bay AQuatic Center 

wrmng courses at MIT IS dlffl ult 
because "most of the students 
have poor language ski ll s." 

Although there IS a Wnung 
Major at MIT, only about fo ur 
students a yeaT gmduate With a 
wming degree , and there are 
only four creative writing 
instructoTS within the 
depanment . 

However, UC D's fic tion 
workshops , which contain about 
25 students, are much larger 
than those at MIT, and , 
therefore. it IS a little more 
difficult to give personal 
attention to each student writer. 
She also feels that UCSD's 
quaner system makes it harder to 
accomplish as much as she 
would wish . Howe continues 
Instructing at MIT because "after 
all this time , 1 have a cenain 
ded ication to the students," 

Howe's main reason for 
temporarily leaving the east coast 
was "to get a sense of other 
p laces." Afte r being at MIT fo r 
eight years, she felt she needed a 
change of scenery. She has 
always bee n pan ial to Califo rnia's 
coastline and loves UCSD's 
p roximity to the ocean. 

MIT's campus !O her is 
"oppressive and hideous ... all of 
the buildings are huge cement 
struc tures with no light or green 
commg through . Boston 's 
weather, too , makes the general 
atmosphere rather gloomy." 

She did have misgivings about 
leaving home for four months, 
some of wh ich were triggered by 
the fact that, as a Single mother, 
she had not been separated from 
her children In 18 years . Her 
first expenence of San Diego 
back In December was even less 
promising. "For twO weeks I had

f .,....~ ."., 1If ~ 4-
'. ~ .' U CSD on cable TV? Yes! "San Diego Stew," an experimental telev,ision pr~ect produced by UCSD stUdents, is so named because it allows the p rogram to be about anything and everything, male strippers, undocumented fann migrant workers, a knife collection 

and peace festiVals, to name a few sample videos. 
Professor Dee Dee Halleck of the communication depattment leads the band of students that 

produce the weekly 3O-minute program, yet her role is minor. "I see myself asa facilitator," said 
Halleck. "I don't dicrate methods, I encourage the students to use their own resources." 

Halleck, who joined the UCSD £aculty last fall , had been working in New York City as a 
teacher and as a free-lance ftIm and video maker. She was nominated for an Academy Award in 
1965 for the documentary "A Mural on Our Street," and in 1983 won secone place at the Cannes 
Film Festival for her documentary entided "Haiti: BitterCaine." She has been working in public 
access television for the last five years and was one of the first members of the New York City-
based collective "Paper Tiger Television." 

HaDeck emphasized the importance of the student effott in the production. "They are much 
more rigorous censors of material than I," she said. "My quality control is by telling them how [0 
see and choose." 

"'San Diego Stew' is all about srudents," said Dan Mattin. a member of the class that produces 
the video. "Its intention is to make use of students' works at large, and to produce works of good 
enough quality to be shown on public access lV." The projects are student-produced , studio 
fihned in the Media and Communication Center on campus or on location. 

Her students accustom themselves to this unique style of teaching. "We found out quickly 
that she wasn't going to do everything for us," said Mattin. ''She's very unconventional, she gives 
no straightforward assignments." 

Video production is costly, yet the students producing the show are able [0 use the media 
equipment on campus for free . The actual cost of renting a studio is about $450.00 an hour. 
Students have free use of the stUdio for six hours a week. The only expense is the 3/4 inch 
videotapes on which they record their material, plus any outside-of-srudio expenses. 

Halleck praised highly the UCSD media £acilities and encouraged students to take advanrage 
of them. "Students can receive high level. production experience with the same equi pment that 
is used at the cable companies," she said, This hands-on experience provides exceDent 
training for video work after coDege. 

Halleck is confident about the resources at UCSD. · Public Access lV uses local talent, it is 
exciting~nd fresh . We use the very rich sources and talemon the UCSDcampus for 'San Diego 
Stew.' We could do four lV series a night on what goes on at this campus. 

"I know that San Diego is a much more creative place than the local news allows it [0 be," 
Halleck said . Maybe "San Diego Stew" will serve as a creative channel. Look for it at: 8:30 pm 
Monday. on Carlsbad Cable; 9:30 pm Tuesday, Cox Cable; 6:30 pm Wednesday and 6 pm 
Friday, Del Mar Cable; and 6 pm Wednesday on Southwestern Cable. -Karen Kumm

popular class is basic sailing. The 
Aquatic Center began on the 
principle of sailing and grew . 
from there," Huth commented. A 
basic sailing class is designed for 
people who have litde or no 
expenence and need [0 start at 
the begi nnning, or fo r those who 
have had moderate experience 
but need to refresh their sailing 
skills. Advanced Sailing, Hobie 
Cat O inic and Keel Boat Sailing 
are also available. Multi-level 
water skiing courses can vary 
from advanced, competition, 
bare foOl or recreational. 

If you happen to be shy and 
don't want [0 make a public 

'specrable of yourself, the private 
lessons might be right up your 
alley. All private lessons are a 
.minimum of cwo hours and allow 
no more than three people per 
lesson. These lessons are 
aYllilable for $15 an hour. On the 
other hand , if crowds are your 
style and you enjoy meeting 
people, special recreational and 
instructional events or pa rties for 
eligible groups are provided. An 
example package includes: The 
Get-Together Package, which is 
designed for IS-30 people and 
can include volleyball, Hobie Cat 
or J-24 rides, wmdsurfing 
lessons, dancing, BBQ, sound 
system and use of the Aquatic 
Center facility. • 

The AquatiC Center 
recreational eqUipment rental 
programs offer the use of ' 
sailboards, canoes, kayaks. wave 
skis, surfboards, rowing whenys, 
singles, shells, sailboards and 
recreational enjoyment. "The 
center has a large inventory of 
the highest quality equipment 
available," Huth said, 

·We want all of our students 
to have fun , but this is a P.E, 
class with midterms and finals 
like any other UCSD course." 

There 's a 4,000 
acre water recreation 
area for every type of 
aquatiC related 
activity. 
Huth claimed. Not only are 
grades unavoidable, but so are 
fees . Each course listing is 
followed by cwo fees. The first 
fee (lower of the cwo) applies [0 
SDSU and UCSD current 
students only (exception to lower 
fe e policy are faculty/staff who 
have purchased a recreation 
card). The MiSSIon Bay Aquatic 
Center is subsidized by student 
fees from the universities , .. A 
beginning surfing course would 

,cost SDSU and UCSD students 
't3S and others 't48.

Wydra drives goHers to tide been dropped. The driving green is a nice relaxed atmosphere and quite popular. Many pros like to 
practice there because they are 
allowed to "shag" their baDs. In 
golf it is important that you 
practice with the balls that you 
play with. At many places you 
must use their balls on their 
range. Not so in this· part of 
town . 

lL ,"NNE MCLFVIE, "4 We'" 
HE wind is blowing 
through the broken 
window of a small shack. 

The outside is half painted. 
giving it an antiquated look. 
Inside it is bare except for 
buckets of golf baUs and a chatty 
tan man fixing golf clubs. People 
stop in every Rowand then to 
say hello. 

This is the humble home of 
one of the best golf teams in the 
country, UCSD. The man is Mike 
Wydra, coach, counselor, expert. 

His career at UCSD began in 
1975. That year he was the first 
UCSD golfer to go to nationals. 
He can still be found at UCSD, 
teaching, coaching and of course 
st ill playing. You may say that 
you did not even know that we 

had a golf ream. Although they 
do keep a low profile on 
campus. everyone in the golfing 
community knows who they are. 

The Triton team has gone to 
nationals every year that Wydra 
has coached. When he first took 
over the pOSition as coach, the 
team was lacking many things, 
things which he supplied them. 
The most important is his 
knowledge of the game of golf. 
He went pro in 1978 and still 
plays in the circuit, about 20 
events a year. He admits , "my 
passion is playing." 

This is an unusual situation in 
that "90 percent of golf coaches 
in college level are adminiStrative 
types. They are neither interested 
nor trained," said Wydra. He 
doesn't believe in classroom

with his players. The guys come 
OUt and hit the balls in between 
classes and get specialty 
coac hing with costs the average 
citizen $)0 an hour. 

Another difference in the 
UCSD program is the amount of 
money thaI it has in contrast to 
the other teams. II often plays 
against teams with big money. 
The team that has beat the 
Tritons the last two years at the 
Nationals for Division III is Cal 
State Stanislaus. It seems that 
they are supposed to follow the 
same guidelines as we do in 
regards to scholarships, but they 
have a large booster club which 
gives perspective team members 
financial help. Wydra doesn't 
wOn}' much about his situation,

he must says, "We're going to go 
ahead and beat them anyway. 
Show them that poor people can 
win." 

Often they play teams with 
matching uniforms, while UCSD 
golfers buy aU their own 
equipment. As Wydra points out, 
"we look like ragamuffins out 
there and we're kicking their 
butts." It is this attitude and 
drive which has helped to make 
UCSD's team so strong the last 
seven years. Especially in the last 
two years, which has seen them 
finish in second place nationally. 

Out by the Mesa apartments 
you will find the UCSD driving 
range and putting green. There 
were plans for a fuD course when 
Wydra first started coaching. but 
since Proposition 13. they have 

One professional golfer a 
couple of years ago used the 
range so much, he donated a 
putting green; a thousand dollar 
gift to the program. Now if we 
can just get someone 10 donate a 
building with windows and 
electricity. 

ObViOusly a person who can 
obviously bring a team from 
nowhere into the limelight would 
be sought after by bigger schools; 
this is the case with Wydra. He 
has been offered jobs with 
Division I schools, but his heal'!

Wydra 
Continued from page 13 
is WIth UCSD, He comments that 
he has never seen an athletic 
director that cares as much as 

Judy Sweet. He feels that the 
athletic program here is going 
well, He enjoys the Division UI 
group. He thinks that classes are 
as important as sports and feels 
that part of the success of his 
team is how intelligent they are , 

Golf is not a game of great 
physical power. but mental 
power and emotional control. It 
is importan,~ to Wydra in that it 
consmutes overall mammy 
training," Techniques are of 
utmost importance along with a 
need to stay calm and rational. 

Understanding that golf is a 
difficult game to appreciate , so 
~ is not surprised at the low 
number of spectators, Last year 
they had a record high of four 
people at the 30 events, He 
understands that the average 
person JUSt docsn 't know the 
sport, He came to realize this 
when he first met his present 
wife. When he told her he golfed 
professionally, she said , "What is 
a gol!?" Many UCSD students 
may be able to relate to that. 

If you ever feel a need to 
expand your horizons and try 
the spOrt of golf, high on the 
recommendation list of teachers 
is Mike Wydra. Judy Malone, the 
sports infonnation director had 
her first class and had only 
praise for his teaching ability, 

Wydra teaches the golf classes 
on campus as well as private 
lessons, Although most of his life 
revolves around the sport, he 
sees his life split into four jobs: 
teaching classes. private lessons, 

.. I coaching and playing. It seems if 
I you enjoy so much what you do, 
I why go somewhere else for 

employment.

An Arts Magazine Serving the l:JCSD Community 
Volume 14 Number 10 March 12.1987 

Confronting issues 
Ked ric Robin Wolfe -

actor, writer, dancer, welder 
has fulfi lied all his 

boyhood ambitions , except 
for one. He still hasn't been to 
the moon. But he did the next 
best thing. Instead of traveling 
to a heavenly body, he became 
one. 

Wolfe became an angel in 
response to international 
terrorism, Watergate and a 
series of "what ifs." It was 
performance art, but he also 
calls it "a personal mission, a 
grand gesture of art and 
theatre and all kinds of 
philosophical ideas." 

The tall, lanky stringbean of 
an actor must have made an 
unlikely angel, with his 
balding head and quizzical 
eyes. However, after watching 
the recent production at the 
Lyceum Space of "Warren's 
Story" - the one man show 
he both wrote and performed 
in - it's easy to believe that he 
could be convincing in almost 
any role. 

" Warren's Story" is the 
saga of three generations of 
Wolfe's family. In it, his 
Uncle Warren goes from 
being a barber in Canton, 
Ohio, to hero status as the 
much-clecorated World War 
II "Fighting Barber," who 
escapes from a Japanese 
prisoner of war camp by 
slitting his captor's throats 
with a concealed straight-edge 
razor. 

Wolfe is transformed into 
many characters as he tells the 
stories: U nde Warren; Kedric 
as a child; a fat hog farmer 
begging one time two many 
for Uncle Warren to tell his 
war stories; Miss Humerey-
cows, an outraged third grade 
teacher; Meg, a pregnant 
girlfriend; Meg's child, also 
named Warren, whose father 
is either Kedric or his brother 
Jay. 

Barefoot and dressed in an 
olive-drab jumpsuit, Wolfe 
seems to have absolute 
command of his body 
whether he's putting it 
through jerking spasms of 
electrocution, balancing it in 
outlandishly precarious 

JpoSitions, or moving, always, with fluid grace. The play makes a strong 
Istatement for peace, although 

lfe y,s that wasn't 

bv trish brown 
necessarily what he started 
out to do. "But the elements 
just fell into place and that was 
the end result," he adds. It's 
also both funny and 
disturbing. 

Audiences always want to 
know if "Warren's Story" is 
true. Did it all really happen 
just like that? He responds to 
such questions by asking what 
the viewer's experience of the 
performance was. "The main 
thing is that, even if some of it 
was shuffled a bit, there are no 
possibilities here that couldn't 
become realities," he says. 
"That's the thing that makes it 
horrifying; if indeed it is, in 
part, horrifying." 

Asked how his stint as an 
angel came about, Wolfe 
launched into a vivid account. 
In 1976, he asked himself, 
"What if a flying saucer 
landed on the White House 
lawn? There would be no way 
that it could be sloughed off as 
swamp gas." But he realized 
no saucer was likely to land in 
the Rose Garden. So then 
thought, " Well, what if an 
angel s howed up? They 
couldn't deny that." Before 
long, that idea became " Why 
don't 1 just go out and do it?" 

"It was a sort of Don 
Quixote kind of idea," he 
says, " to go back to 
Washington D.C. and be an 
angel, as my personal gesture 
to the country during the 
bicentennial celebration." He 
spent six weeks putting the 
angel outfit together. "Not a 
tacky one," he said. "We're 
not talking coathanger stuff, 
we're talking about a state--of-
the-art angel." He wore a long 
white robe, a gold halo, a 28-
string harp, and wings. Great 
wings, made of titanium rods 
and covered with mylar. "An 
aeronautical engineer came up 
to me on the Mall in 
Washington," he says. Here 
Wolfe's voice becomes more 
pragmatic, graver, as he 
metaphorphoses into the 
engineer. "The engineer said, 
'I don't know what your trip 
is, but let me tell ya 
something. Those are good 
wings. Just from a structural 
standpoint, those are good 
wings.''' 

As modus operandi, Wolfe 
carried a broom "a 
gorgeous broom, painted 

white, with a red velvet cover 
over the top part" - and a 
fancy dustpan that said 
"Angelic Janitorial. " At the 
Watergate Hotel and other 
Washington landmarks, he'd 
whip out the broom and 
dustpan and " clean up the 
mess ." He swept up 
everywhere - at the White 
House, the FBI, the Pentagon. 
After leaving Washington, he 
went to New York for the 
Republican Convention, to 
Montreal for the Olympics, 
and to Kansas City for the 
Democratic Convention. In 
all , he spent three months as 
an angel, plucking his harp 
and listening to comments 
that his presence provoked in 
the people he encountered. 

Reactions varied, he says. 
"Some people threw bottles at 
me. Others would take me 
home, wash my angel suit and 
give me a place to sleep." 
Worst were the d runks . 
Wolfe discovered that 
"drunks and wings do nol 
mix," he says emphatically. 
The volatile combination 
resulted in much of the rock-
and bottle-throwing. The 
other group that gave him 
trouble was the born-again 
Christians. "I got clobbered 
real bad (by them)," he says. 

Last spring, Wolfe gained 
national fame as "l'retzelman" 
when he wrapped his feet 
behind his head in a television 
commercial for Eastern 
Airlines. After practicing yoga 
for 20 years, the position 
came easy for him. Aside from 
finding yoga helpful in his 
work, Wolfe calls it "a noble 
path, a spectacular method for 
being a human being." He 
says, "I think if you let any 
human live for five or six 
thousand years without 
getting to die, sooner or later 
they're going to discover 
yoga. " 

For his next project, Wolfe 
says, " We're probably going 
to remount ("Warren's 
Story") in Los Angeles for a 
time. Then we're going to take 
out of the closet, as it were, a 
piece I had done previously to 
this, called 'Blind Stab.'" 

It's another one-man show 
and he describes it as "also a 
high energy piece, but 
completely different."

Old songs, new medium 
There was a celebration in 

record stores across the 
country as the first Searles 
compact discs went on sale. 
After a long and complex 
series of legal hassles which 
had held up their release for 
more than three years, fans 
camped out in front of record 
stores to get first crack at 
them. Everyone was talking 
about them - college 
students, yuppies, disc 
jockeys, even the almighty 
Dan Rather. 

These are the four initial 
albums recorded and released 
by the Bearles -"Please 
Please Me," "With the 
Beatles," .. A Hard Day's 
Night" and "Searles for Sale" 
- and they are not the 
reassembled, slice-and-diced 
Capitol versions that we're 
used to in the United States. 
They are in mono, which 
would seem puzzling and 
disappointing, since CDs are 
best known for their high 
quality sound. But don't let 
this deter you - they sound 
crisp and clear, free of the 
muffled AM car radio sound 
generally associated with 
mono. Further, these early 
albums were originally 
recorded with mono in mind 
(very few people had stereos 
back then), and thus have a 
more generally disjointed 
sound in stereo than the 
smooth sound found on these 
discs. 

As far as the individual 
discs go, the star of the batch 
is "A Hard Day's Night." This 
is not the soundtrack album, 
with its suffocating elevator 
music on every other track. 

by richard crail 

Instead, this album contains 
five songs not used in the film 
but written at the same time, 
including ''I'll Cry Instead," 
"Things We Said Today" and 
"I'll Be Back." The sound is 
bright and clear throughout, 
embellishing these songs and 
other old favorites like "If I 
FeU," "Can't Buy Me Love" 
and "And I Love Her." 

The album "Please Please 
Me" contains the same songs 
found on the Capitol LP "The 
Early Searles." However, the 
sound is much cleaner 
(tholl2h it still retains some 
tape hiss) and the sloppy, 
previously used, take of the 
song "Please Please Me" has 
been replaced with the take 
originally intended for release 
- the first time this has been 
issued in America. It's a real 
treat ... a song which, along 
with "I Saw Her Standing 
There" and "Twist and 
Shout," should be cranked up 
to maximum volume. 

"With the Searles" isn't 

quite as fresh or endearin\!, 
but the sound quality is once 
again a large improvement 
over the American LPs and it 
does have its moments -
particularly with "All My 
Loving," "RollOver 
Beethoven" and "Money." 
Though it omits "I Want to 
Hold Your Hand" and " This 
Boy," this is still largely an 
upbeat, fun album. 

"Seatles for Sale," though' 
containing many familiar 
songs, has not stood the test of 
time well, chiefly because 
many songs are either gloomy 
("I'm a Loser" and "Baby's in 
Black") or sappy ("Eight 
Days a Week" and "Mr. 
Moonlight"). However, it still 
has high points, including 
"Rock and Roll Music" (with 
John Lennon gleefully 
screwing up the lyrics), 
"Every Little Thing" and 
"Kansas City." The sound 
quality on this disc is the best 
of the set. 

Admittedly, most casual 
Bearles listeners are probably 
mainly geared up for the 
band's later releases, such as 
"Revolver," "Abbey Road" 
and "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely 
Hearts Club Band," which 
will be issued chronologically 
with the rest of the albums 
chroughout the remainder of 
the year. However, these first 
four albums still exude the 
freshness and brightness that 
attracted their fanactical 
following in the early 196Os. 
Even for those of us that were 
not around yet when they 
were first released, they 
remain, pure and simple, a lot 
of fun. 

Starts Friday the 13th at a specially selected theatre near yo u.

"Don't look at me 
Madame, it's your story!", 
yells Miss Jean. And indeed it 
is. Eleanora Antinova's story 
that is. The Ant inova 
character is one of per-
formance artist Ele.anor 
Antin's many personas. 
Antinova is fearured, along 
with Robyn Hunt's "Miss 
Jean" in the rwo-woman play 
Who Cares About A Ballerina?, 
also written by Antin. 

UCSD's own Robyn Hunt and Eleanor Antin. 

Although literally a two-
woman play, the performance 
is fa r from the average two-
character production. The 
story is built around the 
poignant attempt by Madame 
Eleanora Antinova, the great 
Russian Ballerina, to get her 
memoirs written. Robyn 
Hunt hillariously plays the 
stream of "Miss Jean's" from 
office temps, assigned to type 
the tales of the somewhat 
eccentric aging ballerina. 

The Madame's story is a 
sort of stream-of-con-
sciousness of her glory days as 
a balle rina that is in a sense 
more of a backdrop for the 
Miss Jean interpretations . 
The interpreta tions do not 
reflect what Eleanora is really 

trying to tell. Essentially the during the performance, and artist, Antin notes that even

4 Hiatus March 12, 1987 

Hunt. who does come from 
an exclusively theatrical 
background loves the "wacky, 
zany, wild spirit of 
performan ce art." She 
describes the process as "very 
much like a theatrical 
production except that the 
playwright was very much 
there." 

Hunt and Antin are both 
UCSD faculty members. 
Their outside projects are a 
boon to their students and the 
university, for it is exciting to 
learn with a teacher who 
actively practices their craft, 
as well as further their artistic 
fields . 

The artists plan to take Who 
Cares About A BallaTina! to 
New York and to other cities 
as well. The play runs through 
March 22 at The Bowery 
Theatre. The theatre is located 
on the bottom of an older 
hotel at 480 Elm Street in 
Downtown, San Diego. 

The play also addresses the 
issue of aging, more 
specifically women and artists 
aging. Antin asks when a 
dancer loses her youth and 
beauty, Who Cares About A 
&llerina! 

Comedy 
Continued from peae J 
haq to abide by two basic 
rules: no profanity and no 
ethnic slurs. The first 
participant was Alex Wong, a 
sophomore Communications 
major. He joked among other 
things about his trip to 
Europe with his family, where 
he observed "Italy is the only , 
place in the world where stop 
signs are an option." His act 
was cheerful and set a nice 
pace for the temainder of the 
young comedians. 

The second comic was Alan 
Ou, a junior Molecular 
Biology major. He borrowed 
from 1950's comedian Tom 
Lehrer (regretfully without 
acknowledgment) singing 
Lehrer's song about love and 
pain The Masochism Tango. 
The song, which relies so 
heavily on timing, seemed 
rushed and awkward, but 
credit should be given to 
anyone who would get up on 
stage and Sing in front of a pub 
crowd. 

Third college freshman 
Daryl Peek, went next., 
bringing with him cue cards of 
certain words which were 
deemed unacceptable by the 
judges. With these aids, he 
may very well have been the 
first comedian in history to 
deliver an act fuU of bathroom 
humor with no verbal 
profanity. His act was funny, 
but he seemed to run out of 
material before running out of 
nerve, and his performance 
went a little long. 

Perhaps the most mem-
orable performance of the 
night came from perennial 
student, UCSD Guardian's 
anachronism, Robert Leone. 
Though by far not the 
funniest of the group, his 
dance on stage at the request 
of a heckler, is likely to stick 
in those people's minds who 
were lucky enough (for lacle. of 
a better term) to be in 
attendance. Hands down 
Robert won the "at least I 
tried award" of the night.

Successful brother combi-
nations are so rare in the 
musk world they come 
around about once a decade. 
The fifties had the Everly 
Brothers; the sixties, the Kinks ; 
the seventies, Val). Halen; and 
the eighties might be on to 
something with Rank and File. 
Tony and Chip Kinman 
undertake both the writing 
and vocals on Rank and File's 
self-titled album. 

The addition of Jeff Ross 
(lead guitarist) and R. Kahr 
(drummer) make this Rank 
and File album sound a lot 
more like a debut than a third 
attempt. Combining straight 
ahead , guitar-oriented rock 
with touches of country and 
punk this album displays a 
raw power not seen too often. 

Two previous albums , 
"Sundown" and "Long Gone 
Dead, to brought some critical 
recognition to the band but 
this album has the potential to 
make them into a substantial 
success. " Black Book," the 
first single and video from the 
ten-song collection , may 
appear to be your average 
rock song that you see on 
MTV and never think twice 

about, but it only gets better. 
"Golden Age," a country-

flavored tune, begins to 
demonstrate the lyrical talent 
of the Kinmans along with the 
band's versatility. While so 
many bands are trying to 
rehash the sixties' " Golden 
Age" the Kinmans offer more 

of a time to move on, 
a reflective look at the sixties: 
"We have love to treasure, 
don't stop and fall behind. 
We have miles to go before we 
sleep." 

Not to miss out on the latest 
issue of protest, the closing 
song on side one, "Pistol 

Dawn," passionately speaks 
out against South Africa. The 
vocals on this one are 
extremely grabbing as an 
apocalyptic voice warns: 
"Good night, sleep tight. You 
can only live a lie for so long. 
Good night, sleep tight. Then 
awake to the pistol dawn." 

The only real flaw with the 
album is the band's tendency 
to let screeching guitars 
overcome their otherwise 
enjoyable music. This is not to 
take away from solid guitar 
work featured in such songs as 
"Good Times" and "Love 
House." The final song on the 
album, "Love House" is also 
the best as the rhythm guitar 
does not get blown out by a 
raunchy lead that too often 
ends up not going anywhere. 

Spending a lot of time on 
the road, the songs were 
written during the day and 
tried out at night. This process 
has been going on for the past 
three years with the album 
featuring the ten best of the 
Kinman brother's originals. 
Maybe it is not as great as 
fraternal acts of yesteryear but 
definitely a pair worth giving a 
listen to.

"Did you ever hit your 
elbow on the side of a coffee 
table when you're reaching to 
pick up the Calendar section 
of the Sunday Times and your 
nerve starts buzzing and you 
don't know whether to swear 
from the pain or laugh 
because it tickles? My play is 
something like that," says 
Michael Ahn of Guests in 
America (GIA). 

"It's the turning point in 
life where you either succumb 
to it and die or turn around 
and fight it. It comes at YQU 
from a lot of places - hard 
music, static movement and 
text," says Julie Brams, al~

that their plays, along with 
two others are being produced 
entirely by volunteers. Their 
production company, ca lled 
Guests in America, is made up 
of volunteer actors, writers 
and directors, all working 
together for "experience and 
exposure. " 

Directed by UCSD grad 
Robert Ames, GIA is made up 
almost entirely of UCSD 
students and graduates, all 
looking to sharpen theatrical 
skills in a performance of four 
pieces at the Bowery Theatre 
next Monday, Tuesday and 

W ednesday nights . The 
Bowery, which has recently 
put on "Bent" and "An 
Evening of Brecht," has a long 
history of providing space for 
new and experimental theatre. 

GIA's plays fit both the 
"new" and "experimental" 
categories nicely, among the 
works being featured are a 
performance piece mixing 
dance with a narrative 
monologue, a "poem play" 
covering the lives of four 
women and a play that 
features headless teddy bears 
as props and has bagpipe 
music for an overture. 

The concept of "gypsyirtg" 
theatre performances is not 
new to UCSD. Groups such 
as Sledgehammer Theatre.

which put on the uccessful 
"Action" and the theatre 
department's "Cabaret" have 
pioneered the way for new 
talent to be seen.· 
. ' "The problem is, it's almost 
impossible to get something 
produced unless you get 
enough people with enough 
faith and strong backs to work 
for free," says Ahn. Brams 
agrees. "This is probably one 
of the few chances you'll getto 
see a change of pace from the 
same old theatre you see atthe 
Globe day after day. It's not 
Shakespeare." 

Among the four pieces 
being presented includes a 
"poem play of women's lives 
and thei r choices." Written 
by Julia Doughty, a UCSD 

literature / writing major , 
" When This is a House Built 
and Lived In," is about 
" women's despair and hope, 
opportunities taken and 
missed, the influence of 
home, relationships and work 
on their lives." "Present 
Tense," written by UCSD 
graduate Susan Gelman, is 
described by those in it as "a 
psychological play, sort of like 
diving in a person's mind. 
Something that the audience 
will come out saying, 
'Whoa!' " 

According to its founders , 
Guests in America exists out 
of desperation. Faced with the 
reality of graduation, the 
writers searched for some way 
to be able to display their 

" , 

work without having to 
perform on the streets or 
tailor their work to 
mainstream theatre. Their 
a nswer was wi th the 
communication department's 
Robyn Hunt. Hunt, who also 
is artistic director of the 
Bowery Theatre downtown, 
offered GIA space for their 
performances. "We have 
been existing in the cracks at 
UCSD. We've been taking 
space for rehearsals wherever 
we can get it; at the drama 
department, the communi-
cation studios, even empty 
classrooms," says Ahn. _'-

Top-rated Aerospace Employer. 
Talk with our representatives about 

why in 1985 The Almanac of American 
Employers rated Lockheed second overall 
among America's largest successful 
companies. Tops among aerospace firms. 
And talk about career opportunities at 
Lockheed. And about our famed "Skunk 
Works" facility where we developed the 
SR-71 Blackbird, an aircraft so advanced, 
it's still the world's fastest, highest flying 
airplane in sustained flight. 

Just sign up in your placement office 
and mark these dates on your calendar: 

Presentation - March 27 
Interviews - March 28 

You'll see why we're a company with a 
~~markable history. And a future as prom-
Ismg as your own. 

Lockheed is an equal opportunit~ affir-
mative action employer. U. S. citizenship 
is required.

Laughs 
Continued from page 4 
came last, in a junior 
Sociology major (which 
Federman in his introduction 
joked was Latin for 
unemployed) named Paul 
R yer. R yer walked on stage 
with two gift wrapped boxes, 
claiming that all comedians 
should have stage presence. 
His dry wit and smooth 
delivery challenged even that 
of Federman, and he had the 
audience "rolling" during his 
entire performance. He joked, 
how once in a department 
store he didn't step off the 
escalator and got sucked 
down to Uescalator hell". To 
his surprise he found all the 
missing children who had 
assumed to be kidnapped but 
had actually just never 
stepped off the e8Calator. 

Ryer's act was by far the 
most polished, but all the 
students who participated 
should be given credit for 
taking the risk and putting 
their pride (as well as their 
sense of humor) on the line. 

UCSD was the tenth out of 
thirteen colleges to take part 
in the west coast regionals of 
the U.S. College Comedy 
Competition. Twelve east 
coast schools are simul· 
taneously holding competi. 
tions. Two contestants from 
each coast will be selected and 
flown first class to Daytona 
Beach in Florida where 
national judge Larry ttBud" 
Melman from "Late Night 
with David Letterman" fame 
will choose the winner. The 
winner will be given a a Sony 
HandyCam and a lifetime 
supply of Sticklets Chewing 
Gum. In addititJO, all 
performances are being video 
taped for a possible spot on 
cable television. 

The comedy competltlOn 
was organized by a company 
called U.S. Concepts, who in 
the past have sponsored 
college band concerts. This is 
their first year dealing with 
comedy and the results have 
been generally successful. The 
average number of partici· 
pants at the west coast schools 
has been around eight, and all 
have abided by rules, except 
one case at San Jose State, 
where a young comic chose to 
flash a certain part of his male 
anatomy, located south of his 
navel region. Emcee Wayne 
Federman, who has worked at 
three of the west coast 
competitions said that the 
UCSD crowd was the most 
receptive that he ha seen. 

All in all, tho e at the pub 
Tue day night were created c 
an experience well worth the 
pri e of admission. Free. (We 
all try to be omedian).
