Nader Calls for National 
Consumer Movement 

by Clay Anderson Staff Writer 
Ralph Nader, national ombudsman for consumer alfairs, spoke 

here Thursday on the lawlessness and corruption which is charac-
teristic of American industry. Nader, a graduate of Harvard law 
School emphasized the need for a consumer movement which would 
force American industry to concern itself with quality and safety as 
well as profits. 

As Nader spoke to the crowd of 5oo,it was apparent that he viewed 
the university as both a cause of the problem and as a force for its 
solution. He noted that universities seem to measure the importance 
of a subject by its "abstracticion level," which is the degree to which 
a discipline is removed from reality. Thus law students study dl'iver 
liabilit without ever discussing car safety aoo engineerinr students 
study cons uc ion without ever considering the automobile. 

Not only are universities t.1iling to rain the right pers0IlD!!I,he 
continued, but the students themselves otten sit around discussing 
"cosmic issues" while breathing polluted air, eating impure ham-
burgers, and smoking cigarettes. While concentrating on a war which 
has killed 38,000 American over a period of eight years, students have 
ignored America's toll of highway caI'!lage which annually totals 50,000

killed and 150,000 permanently crippled. 
After reviewing this level of violence, Nadar asked who decides 

what violence gets attention? He concluded paradoxically, that more 
attention is given to violence the tuther away it is from a person. 
Thus crime in the streets is discussed rather than the unrelenting 
violence on one's body which is caused by air pollution. He went on 
to state that it was cuff-linked corporation executives, not street kids, 
who are committing the violence in this country. 

The corporations, Nadar contends, have twisted the free market 
basis of our economic system until little is lett except the words 
themselves. Our economic system is based not only on the exchange 
of products and services, but also on the free exchange of informa-

triton 
ti es 

tion concerning these products and services. 
FRIDAY, OCTOBER 24, 1969 VOLUME 8, ISSUE 4 Corporations, however, have succeeded in restrict~g the amount 

of information available to the consumer while limiting the areas 
of meaningful competition. Thus Nadar points out it is much more 
difficult to learn the braking ability of a car than it is to find out how 
qickly it will accelerate from zero to sixty miles per hour. Likewise, 
the meat industry has failed to inform its customers that over the 
last two decades the fat content of hot dogs has almost doubled. 

With less real information available to the public, says Nadar, 
the competition between firms has narrowed to a few unimportant 
areas. Thus next meat producers compete on the basis of "fresher 
looking" and "more tender", while failing to discuss what is actually

Automobile companies compete over body styles, quarter mile 
times, and leg room. What is lacking, Nadar points out, is any dis-
cussion of braking distances, handling abilities, passenger safety, 
or rear window visibility. The choice offered to consumers is

he noted " is far from over." 

Los Angeles Superior Court 
Judge Jerry Pacht declared Mon-

simply no choice at all. 
Nadar continued by saying the corporations otten test their products 

on the entire country rather than on rats. He indicated that the latest 
controversy over the sugar SUbstitute cyclamated is actually several 
years old. Doubts about its effects were raised a long time ago, but 
the industries failure to continue testing of the product led people 
to believe that there were no 111 effects. That no ill effects were dis-

Nadar concluded his remarks by stating that the burden of proof as 
to the safety of a product is finally starting to shift from the con-
sumer to the corporations, but that the consumer in the market place 
is just as helpless and frustrated as the students in many of our 
colleges. A union of middle class consumers and concerned students, 
however, could have a tremendous effect on our society. Among the 
activities which Nadar suggested were student study groups to inves-
tigate government policies and a student moratorium on pollution.

AgneW" Pays Su rise Visit to Scrip 
"" by Paul Emus 
Assoc. News Editor 

Vice President Spiro T. Agnew, while 
paying a visit fo Scripps institutIon of Ocean-
ography yesterday morning, was confronted 
with a statement he made recently that 
students were "intellectual snobs." 

Dr. William Nierenberg, director of Scripps 
Institute, flew home from Brittain on a 
24 hours' notice to brief Agnew on the latest 
developments on research in the field of 
o~eanograpny. 

Enroute for a week's vacation at Palm 
Springs, Agnew, who is chair nan of the 
President's Marine Resources Council was 
also briefed by Professors Douglas Inman, 
John Isaacs, and Edward Goldberg. 

The five areas of top priority that the 
Nixon administration feels are important 
for support are: (1) coastal zone manage-
ment, (2) coastal laboratories (like Scripps) 
(3) lake restoration, (4) suwort for the 
Decade of International Cooperation in Ocean-
ographic Research, and (5) exploration of 
the arctic regions and study of their en-
vironments. 

During the question and answer period, 
this reporter caused some furor with the ques-
tion: " Mr. Vice President, as a student here, 
I would like to ask if you think calling tbd 
futu re leaders of tomorrow "intellectual 
snobs" could precipItate your so-called vIo-
lence on campus?" 

Agnew replied: 'I'm glad the question was 
raised and I'd like to answer it because--
as frequently happens-- a person makes a 
speech that is recorded, and then mis-
recorded, and then by word of mouth re-
peated. 

Vice Pres. Spiro Agnew, Chancellor and Mrs. McGill, and Dr. Nierenberg 
"t want to say that I did not clearly refer 

to the students or any generation necessarily. 
What I said was in reference to what I 
called an effete core of intellectual snobs. 
I was referring to the people who are in 

the leadership of some of the movements 
today, who are stimulating anarchy or dis-
ruption of the only academic freedom that 
ever existed." 

" I did not refer to the young people of 
this country of whom I have the highest 
regard. And in fact, in that speech, I took 
great care to commend the young people 
in the schools of the country because I think 
they are, in many ways, our only hope." 

"But I cannot mince mv words when I 
refer to the type of people I dId refer to 
and my remarks with respect to them stand 
unabridged. " 

Atter the applause, Chancellor McGill 
stood up to add: " I would hope that none 
would show any discourtesy to the Vice 
President of the United States." 

In response to a question concerning 
moratorium dissent, Agnew said: "1 don't 
believe that (the young people) have the 
knowledge or even some of them have the 
stability to make the judgments as to what 
should be done in that situation (the imme-
diate withdrawal of all US troops). And 
I wonder sometimes what causes some people 
to believe that these self-appointed leaders 
are more up to date than the elect~d rep-
resentatives of the people. . 

He did, however, preface his remark with: 
"1 have never quarreled with any means 
of demonstration that comes within the con-
stitutional discretion of free speech. "

them tram 

He went on to say that the courts 
have consistently ruled that the 
Constitution forbids the erection 
of barricades around thought. The 
people must have the option to 
choose between contending points 
of view. 

Pacht turned down a request by 
the Regents' attorneys for a full 
trial stating that the case is It a 
dispute over law, not fact." Cla-
rifying, he said all the facts in 
the case were accepted and only 
a ruling on the letter of the law 
was required. 

UCSD Chancellor William Mc-
Gill said Tuesday that he was 
"surprised at the swift and swee-
ping character of the court deci-
sion.' 

Tuesday mornigD, Miss Davis 
responded to the court decision 
by saying that " they (the Regents) 
deliberately took an action against 
me that they knew to be uncon-
stitutional from the beginning, 
thereby showing their basic con-
tempt for law and order when it 
is related to justice." 

Pacht further ordered against 
the use of public funds "with a 
purpose, whether direct of indi-
rect, of implementing any of (the) 
said resolutions found illegal. 
He specifically exempted from 
this spending ban expenditures 
related to the Regents' legal ap-
peal of his decision which must 
be done within thirty days. 

In response to the Superior 
Court order, UCLA Chancellor 
Young designated Angela Davis' 
philosophy class, "Recurring 
Philosophical ThE mes in Black 
Literature." a credit course on 
Wednesday. UC President Char-
les Hitch backed Young saying that 
to continue restri ~tions on the 
Communist profes-or's course 
" WOUld have constil uted defiance 
of the court order." 

Meanwhile, a dowr town Los An-
geles attorney, acting on his own 
behalf, filetlataxpayer 'ssultse -
king a Superior Court order bar-
ring Miss Davi from teaching at 
UCLA. He cited several state sta-
tutes and public trust considera-
tions as grounds to require the 
Regents to keep the university 
"entirely mdependent of all poli-
tica I influen es."

The Nixon Administration proposed Monday that firstjime pos-

the recommendations of U.S. health Officials, who have been par-

However, the penalties proposed include prison terms of up

The October 18 issue of Saturday Heview containÂ£ ~n llrticle 

on the Green Ber er s in which most of the facts relating to the 
killing of Chuyen, t Ie alleged double-agent, and the subsequent 
trial in which all c~ rges against the Special Forces were dropped 
are finally brought to light. 

The Special Forc)s decided to kill Chuyen, one of its own men, 
after the CIA order~d them not to, because of a fear of "further

and new defections.' The article contams a history of the Special

ment agencies. 

The Issue also condemns the many actions of the Special Forces 
in an editorial, saying that the consequence of all their activities 
Is that "the government of the United States is cutting deeply into 
its own history and its position in the world, and the refore into 
its secur ity. '

WASHINGTON--(CPS)--The antiwar slogan for 
November ought to be, "Say please for peace." 

The two major organizations coordinating next 
month's protest activities, the Viet Nam Morator-
ium Committee and the New Mobilization Com-
mittee to End the War in Viet Nam, both appear 
to be going overboard In publicly stressing the 
innocuous, well-mannered, respectable nature 01 
their respective ventures. 

Meanwhile, the Viet Nam war continues, though 
there are reports, none of them officially con-
firmed, that President Nixon will announce in his 
Nov. 3 "state of the war" address to the nation 
either a unilateral U.S. cease-fire or a massive 
troop withdrawal of some 300,000 men to take 
place during 1970. 

In the wake of Oct. 15 moratorium demonstra-
tions--successful in terms of the amount of parti-
cipation--national moratorium leaders have de-
cided to push for two days of dialogue and peace-
ful gatherings Nov. 13 and 14, with the accent on 
persuading Congressmen to return home to discuss 
the war with the people. 

Planned are community referenda on the war, 
block parties, coffee hours and leafletting, presen-
tations by special interest groups such as workers, 
profeSSionals and students to elected officials, 
marches to state capitals and symbolic activities 
such as tolling bells and wearing black armbands. 

The New Mobilization brings slightly escalated 
tactics to the arena of dissent. On Nov. 14, it plans 
a national high school and college strike. Q} 
Nov. 13-15 there will be a "March Against Death" 
from Arlington National Cemetery past the White 
House to the Capitol, in which each marcher will 
carry the name of a war victim, placing it In a 
Goffin at the event's conclusion. 

And on Saturday the 15th, one massive march 

somewhat more militant. Instead of focusing solely 
upon Viet Nam as has the moratorium Mobiliza-
tion's literature demands an end to racism, mili-
tarism, poverty and political repression as well 
as the war. 

The old Mobilization, nicknamed MOBE, had 
a history of confronting the establishment with 
collective nonviolent civil disobedience. It co-
ordinated the 1967 march on the Pentagon and played 
a large role in bringing thousands to Chicago in 
1968 at the Democratic Convention. 

But its leaders, Dave Dellinger, editor of Libera-
tion magazine, Rennie DaviS, project director for 
the convention, and Jerry Rubin, Pentagon project 
director, are currently undergoing trial in Chicago 
as members of The Conspiracy, and are away 
from the center of power. 

It remains to be seen whether New Mobilization 
leaders will employ the moratorium's politics of 
consensus for the marchers, watering down their 
appeal to attract a mass of people(thereby insuring 
a relatively mild protest), or whether they will 
pursue a strategy of confrontation. 

Groups such -as the Black Panthers and the SDS 
Weathermen that have siphoned ott the more mili-
tant radicals In recent months, have- not revealed 
if they will join in either the Washington or San 
Francisco marches. 

Though the commercial press has reported there 
is a rift between the Moratorium and the Mobiliza-
tion on the issue of tactics, leaders of the organiza-
tions have expressed their solidarity, if not com-
plete agreement, with one another. Moratorium 
leaders say they are holding peaceful legal 3tfalrs 
of their own, but think it's just fine if people attend 
the Mobilization's peaceful legal marches. Mobili-
zation leaders say they don't see any contradiction 
In participating in both local and national actions.

of one drug that "accounts for 
thousands of deaths every year, 
that, despite decades of use, still 
works on the brain in ways we 
do not understand, and that has 
caused not 0 n I y chromosomal 
damage but actual birth defects." 
T"e drug is aspirin.

it for several years, and some 
were still smoking it regularly . 
The study found that It was used 
as a substitute for alcohol. Those 
who had overused marijuana had 
also overused alcohol at a dif-
ferent period of their lives and 
wOllld probably do so again If 
they were to stop using mari-
juana. "Of the two drugs," he 
said, t/ alcohol is probably the 
more disruptive when used to 
excess. " 

Roger Smith, who has set up 
a clinic in San Francisco, told 
the committee that, "As a re-
sult of this past summer 'smari-

Rer.lI. Results 

by Roger SOOwley AS S~'te Notes Co ege Go,'ts Â· Do They 
Speak for the Students? 
The ancient UCSD problem of college versus campus appeared 

again this week when the AS Senate m,)V~d to appoint represen-
tatives to campus committees for the college governments until 
they can Â·provide adequate mechanis ms for selecting student re-
presentatives. " 

In the past, the AS has been the strongest spokesman at UCSD 
for student opinion, and has preempted college views because 
neither Revelle nor Muir has yet been able to organize an efficient 
or effective government which can send student representatives. 

AS Senator, 'Dimension' Editor 
The AS has thus controlled campus-wide committee assignments, 

giving general regard to co llege representation In most cases. 
In lieu of organized college leaders, the deans of each college 

have often appointed students without receiving legitimate authority 
from the students as a whole. Elected to Revelle Positions Senator Lenny Bourin said that Alan Batchelder, dean of Muir students , made appointments while students remained disorgan-
ized. by Mike Kessel 

Staff Writer 
The Revelle Committee on Col-

lege Affairs and the Executive 
Committee were chosen by adis-
appointing turnout of Revelle un-
dergraduates in an election held 
Tuesday and Wednesday. Students 
chose six s tudent members of 
RCCA from a field 01 eight. 
Similarly the two student 
members of the Executive Com-
mittee were plucked from a field 
of six. 

Muir Elections 

Those elected to the Executive 
Committee were Mark Waxman 
and Paul Kaufman. 

Waxman was a candidate for AS 
President last quarter and is ac-
tive on assorted campus projects. 

Paul Kaufman, an AS Senator 
has other experience in student 
government. Among the pro-
jects he plans to pursue are a 
plan to make the Basic Language 
Program "much more flexible," 
and the possibility of including 
cultures other than western in 
the Humanities sequence. 

The faculty members of the 
Executive Committee, selected by 
the Revelle faculty, are Profs. 
Abram stroll (philosophy) and 
Jonethan Singer (biology). 

The student representatives on 
RCCA are; Bill Keegan, a re-
sident advisor; Karl Keating, ma-
1l3.ging editor of "Dimension;" 
Barbara Radall, Fritizi Muer, 
Radine Pettingell, three fresh-
menj and Thomas Caryl. 

President Jeff Benjamin explained that the AS was concerned about 
getting students appointed by students. "(1m not fighting the colleges, It 
he protested. "It's the administration that I'm concerned about.'

would be sending their own representatives and helping decide

This "double representation ' brought the senate into full debate 
on the meaning of college government. Steve ishme contended that 
college governments were the bona fide spokesmen for students

Collapses 

Ru mor s that the "Trident, " 
the UCSD student yearbook, was 
in trouble were confirmed this 
week when editor Roger Showley 
announced the "Trident" would 
not be published this year. 

Showley said, "Orders were 
only about 1/4 of what had been 
expected. We needed to order 
1,000 "Tridents" to lower the 
price per book sufficiently.' 

Only 250 sales were made, 
however, and the Communica-
tions Board was unable to save 
the "Trident' due to its own 
financial dltflculties. 

Those who did 0 r d e r this 
year's "Trident" may geta com-

"OtherWise,' said steve Landau, editor of the Triton Times, 
"the faculty- members of all committees should be selected with 
student advice in each government." 

Presently the Academic Senate decides appointments for campus 
committees , and each college senate chooses professors for college 
committees. 

In the adopted resolution the AS Senate proposed that it choose 
temporary members for campus committees, especially the Re-
gistration Fee committee. President Benjamin was directed to 
exptain the AS view of stUdent representation to college govern-
ments when they are formed.

Faculty Considers Disavowal of 
1950 Anti-Communist Statement 

by Steve landau 
Ed i tor-J n-Chf ef 

Faculty opposition to the Regents' action 
in the Davis case has been nearlyunanlmous, 
and it appears c~rtain that a resolution of 
some form will be presented to the Regents 
by the Academic Assembly (the state-wide 
representative body of the UC facuIty), ex-
pressing opposition both to this action and 
to the 1950 resolution prohibiting the em-
ployment of Communists by the university. 

However, it appears that this body may 
have trouble in formulating a definitively 
worded statement, if the discussion that 
took place at Tuesday's meeting of the San 
Diego division of the Academic Senate is 
any indication. 

The Senate, meeting in regular session 
for the first time this year, discussed two 
resolutions which the Assembly is consid-
ering submitting to UC faculty by mail 
ballot. If the final form of these resolutions 
are overwhelmingly approved, the results 
will be presented to the Regents in the form 
of a "memorial," the strongest statement 
the Assembly can make. 

TI' resolutions disavowed support of the 
1950 Â·ling (which the Assembly had at 
that Ume supported) and reaffirmed the con-
cept of " no political tests" which had been 
intrOduced by the Regents themselves, last 
AprU, In the form of the Roth amendment 
to the resolution in which theRegentsassum-
ed veto power over faculty appointments. 

Disagreement at the meeting came not over 
the general sense of these resolutions, but 
over the preamble, which sought to clarify 
the baSis upon which the criticisms of the 
Regents was being made. 

The version that received the most critici-
sm had been prepared earlier by six of the 

nine Division Chairmen who compose the 
Academic Council, another state-wide body. 
They felt that it would be advantageous to 
accompany a negative action, namely the 
disavowal of the 1950 ruling, with a positive 
statement of what faculty responsibility should 
be. 

The proposed statement, which referred 
to a faculty member's obligation to give 
his students free access to viewpoints other 
than his own," was thought by some to he 
too vague and, in practice, impossible to 
determine or enforce. 

Sheldon Schultz, Professor of Physics, felt 
that the resolutions should be clarified in 
a different manner. He proposed that a group 
be com missioned to produce a "white paper," 
which would explain to the public the reason-
Ing behind the reversal, within 20 years, of 
the Assembly's stand. This was also de-
feated, several members objecting that such 
a task would require the writing of a book 
at the very least. 

The feeling of the division w1ll now be 
communicated to the Assembly at their Nov. 
3 meeting by Chairman Gabriel Jackson. 
At that meeting the final resolution will 
probably be drafted, and submitted thereafter 
to the UC faculty for their consideration. 

Due to the lengthy discussion of this matter 
the Senate had to adjourn before completing 
much of the business on its agenda. Among 
the items that had to be postponed until 
next month's meeting were reports on Third 
College curriculum and student participation 
on Senate committees, as well as conclusions 
of the joint committee that had been comm-
issioned to consider the matter of with-
drawing credit for classes at the special 
session two weeks ago. 

several matters concerning internal pro-
cedure that have arisen from the increasing 
publicity given to Senate meetings over the 
course of the last year, and the correspond-
ing sensitivity of some Senate members to 
this public exposure. 

No action was taken on a resolution that 
would have .permitted one representative from 
each news media to obtain a press pass 
for Senate meetings. Prof. Victor Rumsey, 
who introduced the resolution , argued that 
since the Senate has allowed 28 observers 
into the room, and has broadcast audio trans -
missions to an adjoining room, Senate pro-
ceedings are public business. He felt that 
if news reports were being made, it would 
be better to allow first-hand observation. 

The reluctance of Senate members to ex-
pose themselves to public scrutiny was also 
exhibited in a resolution that provides for 
an immediate written ballot at Senate meet-
ings, upon the request of !S%ofthose present. 
PrOf. Doolittle, Chemistry Department, 
claimed, in support of the resolution, that 
with hand counts the votes of Senate members 
could be publicly record ~d. The resolution 
passed, 54-8.

Three Roads to Disaster 
The Regents' meeting ot last week should be 

a sign to all that the State-wide University ad-
ministration now considers tuition inevitable. What 
is more, those Regents who have traditionally 
opposed tuition have now aceeded to its necessity. 

The prospect of tuition has surfaced as a result 
of two crises now fac Lng the university. 

First of all our Governor is leading a taxpayer's 
revolt directed at education in general, and the 
University of California in particular. Every 
year that he has been in office he has mercilessly 
slashed the operating budget recommended by Pre-
sident Charles Hitch. 

ow he has promised a UC construction budget 
of no more than $36 million, le ss than one half 
of present needs. The effect of this wuld be 
to cripple the expansion of the university at this, 
a cruc ial time in its growth. 

But more importantly, the state's bond issue, 
used to finance construction, are not selling in 
the currently inflated market at the low interest 
rate of five per cent. Hence, now even Reagan's 
$36 million may never be realized. 

It is these budgetary constraints that have forced 
the UC administration to adopt an attitude of: 
" If we must have tUitton, let's make sure it is 
the most equitable plan." 

Hitch reported to the Regents on the three 
leading plans now being considered. 

The Collier plan, which received the support 
of this year's state Assembly, calls for a flat 
fee tuition equal Â· to the actual cost of education 
(approximately $1,200 a year), which would be 
repaid by the student after graduation when his 
yearly income exceeds $10,000. Interest would 
be charged from the time of issuance of the loan. 

The Reagan plan includes a flat fee tuition--

approximately $250 per quarter, coupled with a 
"comprehensive loan program." 

Finally, the Monagan Plan Is a graduated tuition 
fee corresponding to family income. 

All three plans are clearly difficult to administer 
and sometimes inequitable. The Collier plan is 
both expensive to administer and unfair to the 
student. It forces graduates to "Indenture" them-
selves at a time in their life when they can least 
afford large payments. 

Furthermore, analyses ot the payment plan have 
revealed that not only is the yearly charge ex-
cessive, the the interest rates have somewhat 
the sa me effect as the installment plans whict 
dupe many American housewives. 

Reagan's plan Is clearly elitist and further 
discourages low income access to the University. 
Monagan's plan is, like Collier 's, expensive to 
administer. It places the heaviest load on the 
middle income family, already hardest hit by 
taxes. 

It is important to note that Reagan, having 
succeeded in instituting tuition, could then reduce 
current levels of State support for the University. 
Any tuition plan should suppLement the curren! 
inadequate budget, not be a substitute for current 
funding. It is essential that some agreement 
be reached on this before any committment is 
made to tuition. 

We find all three plans Inadequate and OPPOSE 
any tuition until an equitable plan with carefulll 
delineated uses is formulated. 

We feel tuition in itself is undesirable. It 
may now be a necessary evil because the Governor, 
ostensibly speaking for the people of California, 
is unwilling to support higher education in this 
state at a level it deserves. 

Revive the Spirit of 76 
Students and faculty throughout 

the University are deeply con-
cerned with the future of this in-
stitution. The general concensus, 
as shown in the recent student re-
ferendum, is that Ronald Reagan's 
hostile actions threaten the exist-
ence of the university. The com-
munity is constantly convening, 
convoking and rallying about this 
problem, trying to find a solution 
that will reduce the political pres-
sures and help to direct state 
support to increasing the services 
and commitment ofthe university. 

out that the university faces a de-
crease in quality with the curtail-
ment of funds , that the university 
must expand to meet the true re-
quirements of our fractured so-
ciety, and that Reagan's political 
influence is a danger. And for all

would basically be two fold, the

With the help of donations that 
it would also raise, the Commit-
tee would organize some of the 
massive talent on the campus. It 
could direct, produce publicity, 
video tapes, radio spots; it could 
provide articles, speakers and in-
terviews to all of the media. Our 
students and professors of educa-
tion, political science, medicine, 
economics, philosophy, social 
science, psychology and the phy-
sical sciences would be encoura-
ged to prepare their analysis of 
the present situation and the ne-
cessary course Cor the future . 
The Committee would initiate

pare the information for the

the institution. He has openly 
c !aimed that he hopes to continue 
this interference until he makes

The political issues, rather 

than candidates could be support-
ed, and the people of the state 
could be told what is planned for 
their money, and what they gain 
from it. People would be encou-
raged to write letters to the state 
legislature expressing their opin-
ion and providing a counterbal-
ance to the heated communica-
tions from the enemies ofthe uni-
versity. 

The news media would respond 
if they fe It that the group repre~ 
sented a fairly informed, well 
represented board. Therefore, 
some methOd of representation 
of an executive board would be 
necessary, with a volunteer staff 
that would provide the majority of 
the workers. The board would 
have to be renewed and the in-
stitutions of the comm ittee stabi-
lized to provide a consistantly re-
cognizable organization. The

tee to provide judgement and news

AS SeI.t.' 5 Act;ol ... t 'I''''''' to 
Usurp t'e College Go,erillents 

BY JEFF BENJAMIN, AS PRESIDENT 
(Editor's note: the following column is written by AS President Jeff 
Benjamin in an attempt to explain the action taken by the AS Senate . 
on Monday, when they temporarily assumed awolntment power 
for the college governments. For more information on the topic 
see this week's AS Senate Notes.) 

It should be made immediately clear that the AS Senate, in its 
resolution of October 20 on the registration tees committee, had 
no intention ot usurping the rights ofthe colleges to appoint members 
to the campus-wide administrative committees. The resolution was 
made in the spirit of affirming the position of the AS that student 
appointments should be made by students without influence by non-
student groups. 

Because the administration takes the AS appointments as re-
commendations, albeit approval Is usually automatic, it is impor-
tant that the selection procedure be maintained as a student func-
tion. 

The motion clear ly indicates that the AS is waiting for the estab-
lishment of student selection committees at the various colleges. 
When these begin to [unction, the AS appointments will terminate 
and the college people will take over. The AS is thus merely serv-
ing as a temporary appoi.ntment body and has no intention of per-
manently serving this function outside of its own specilic appoint-
ments. 

The problem situation can be quickly alleviated at Revelle by 
the establishment of a student sub-committee of the college gov-
ernment and almost as rapidly at Muir since government there will 
be soon in coming. However, as the campus-wide student govern-
ment, the AS has an obligation to the students to insure that, in the in-
terim, students are not selected by non-students or non-student 
groups. . 

It appears that in the future, student government at UCSD will 
evolve into a federalistic structure. However, in the mean time, 
is student interests are to be given the service they deserve, the 
channels for the transmission of those interests tot the powers 
that be must be maintained by the most viable student organiza-
tion on campus, the ASUC5O. 

It is my personal opinion that the selection of students for ad-
ministration committees by administrators (even in conjunction 
with faculty and some students) does not constitute real student 
input into campus decision-making. 

I hope that the AS and the college governments can work to their 
mutual benefit and together can work for the benefit of all UCSD stu-
dents. It was with this in mind that the AS Senate passed the October 
20 resoltulon and will continue to work for student representation in 
all areas 01 campus policy and decision making. 

Student Opinions Sought 
on Registration Procedures 

The Committee on Educational 
Policy, an Academic Senate com-
mittee consisting of seven faculty 
members, is presently concerned 
that many students were unable 
to register in the courses they 
wanted this quarter. 

The committee has asked the 
Registrar to supply statistical 
information on this problem and 
department chairmen to tell about 
their problems with a large en-
rollment. In order to get a 
reasonably complete picture of 
the situation, the committee would 
also like to have reports from 
students 0 n how they were af-
fected. Any students are urged 
to write the committee about their 
experiences in registration. Any 
torm is acceptable, but the fol-
lowing topics may be helpful for 
organization. 

1. What classes, if any, were 
you excluded from? 

2. U you were unable to re-
gister in a class, was ita serious 
inconvenience toy 0 u r overall 
progress here? For example, 

were you prevented from taking 
any key courses in a major or 
minor program? 

3. Were you unable to re-
gister for a full program 01 
four courses because of closed 
classes and what effect does this 
have on you--delay graduation; 
subject you to draft? 

In addition, students might 
care to comment on how they 
teel the University should deal 
with this problem which may be-
come increasingly serious. 

1. How should students be 
chosen If there Is more demand 
for a course than there are 
placed in the course? First 
come, first served? Randomly? 
By need? 

2. Would you prefer larger 
class sizes or to have some 
students excluded from classes? 

students wishing to respond,

Each quarter, with sorrowful

re luctantly part with $106 in or-

Most students, it seems don't 
know that six ot these dOllars 
go to the coffers ofthe Associated 
Students. They may be aware of 
the fact that each year the AS

the coming year, but prombly 
don't know exactly how their six

It seems that not even the AS

the operations of the AS, have 
a clear notion of fund distri-

Shouldn't the students know

but there are others who find 
this money hard to come by. 
Likewise, there will always be 
agencies willing to direct the 
spending of fund s as they see fit. 
Shouldn't the students have a 
voice in how their funds are 
spent? Shouldn't they expect 
an answer to the question, â¢ Where 
did that money go?-

Tllanks for 
Moratorium 
We would like to thank the UC-

50 community for their enthu-
siastic support of the October 
15th Moratorium. 

Congratulations to the 300 to 
500 persons who went out into 
San Diego. Our campus, by the 
way, distriooted over 120,000 
leaflets. 

Plans for the November 15th 
and 16th moratorium day strike 
currently envision a march and 
rally in downtown San Diego. 
Use of Balboa Park may be 
denied because of an official 
po sit ion that people passing 
through would have to listen to 
the rally. However, the city plan-
ning commission is considering 
a permit. 

The UC50 Viet Nam Mora-
torium Day Committee will be 
holding its organizational meet-
ing in USB 2622 on Oct. 29 at 
7:30 p.m. All students who want 
to participate in the moratorium 

, should attend. 
Love and Peace,

Salute to Student Klutz 

Recognition of Student Klutz is more than overdue. 11 is long 
past time that he be afforde1 the publicity and attention that he 
so diligently deserves. 

student Klutz has exemplified himseU in a consistent manner 
tor an extended period. He has continuously maintained his in-
variant conduct under the strain of nearly unbearable burdens. 

This salute, like Student Klutz, is of an unusual nature. For 
the jlraise to be bestowed on this deserving individual will not 
allude to anyone, two, or three ot his noteworthy acts, but to 
his innumerable undeeds. 

Yes, the record of these undeeds is, to say the least, boundless. 
So mu~t. ,(I that it is nearly impossible to enumerate any of them, 
lest others perhaps more phenomenal go unmentioned. Yet to 
cite none would certainly be a total disservice to student Klutz; 
even to the extent that the unlisting of these momentous undeeds 
could itseU appear as an attempt to surpass the towering standard 
of this exalted one. 

So let there be no further delay. 
Student Klutz, you are to be extolled for the de~ee of success 

you have achieved in letting all your friends and fellow students 
not know of your laudable unfeats. Most oC us have know you 
tor a considerable time yet we were not aware of your true glory. 

Mention should be made of the manner in which you, Student 
Klutz, have managed to not be identified within that huge campus 
unit that has received so much publicity of late. The importance 
of this is magnified when one realizes that it was you yourseU 
who created this well- known corps, the "silent majority.Â· 

And, perhaps most important, we must commend you, Student 
Klutz, for your consistency in not allowing yourself to be inClu-
enced by the trivialities of student life. Without your example, 
how could we have ever proplerly learned such arduous untasks 
as not voting in student elections, not attending student functions and 
not voicing any constructive suggestions for improvement of these 
functions ? ALso, we must not forget your untaking of positions 
on important issues. 

Space dictates that no further specific honors be cited now. It 
is felt, however, that the following promise should be made. 

Student Klutz, since your conduct does have such profound affects 
upon all of us here at UCSD and at other campuses, every attempt 
wlll be made to see that you get the applause you so justly deserve. 

(A salute to one of Klutz's classmates, Student Schmuch, will 
follow.)

United States in Vietnam 
It Will Fail 

by Raoul Conterras 
Staff Writer 

"It will fail" was the unequivocal opin-
ioo of Tun Van Dinh, former South 
Vietnamese ambassador to the U.S., on 
President Nlxoo's new policy for Vlet-
namization of the Southeast Asian con-
nlct. 

The Viet Minh veteran of the war 
against French colonialism told his au-
dience last Monday that this and any 
similar policy would fail because," ... this 
war. even if you doo't like It, is already 
lost." 

Van Dinh stated that throughout the 
war the U.S. objective has been to prevent 
the VC from gaining political power in 
the South.l However, we ar~ now doing 

In the current national debate on the United State's 
involvement in Southeast Asia, all sides of the issue 
have been aired by the policy makers and the protes-
ters--by the Informed and the incensed, by the man 
on the street and the soldier In the field. This week 
these vlews have been brought to UCSD in a special 
series of six lectures sponsored by the Campus-wide 
Coordinating Committee for Special Programming. In 
this issue the Triton Times presents a report on 
three of these lectures in order to help the University 
community better undarstand tbe problems facing the 
US in Its attempt to end Its Involvement In the war. 
Next week, we will include a review of last night's 
speech by James D. Bell, US Ambassador to Malaysia, 
and today's concluding panel discussion on the con-

to honorabl e extraction from the conflict. 
However, in his opinion it will only lead . 
to great bitterness. 

He stated that Americans in Saigon 
now have a contingency plan to fight the 
South Vietnamese. After the American 
forces have been great ely reduced and 
the VC gain corresponding political power, 
he said, the South Vietnamese officers 

we want to do anyway. 
Van Dinh used thelecturetorecommeod 

that Presldeot Nixon use his November 3 
address to call for a unilateral ceaselire 
and formation of a commission to look 
into tbe problems of withdrawal. 

Tran Van Dinh fs a Washington-based free-lance 
writer, who was a senior member of the South Viet-
namese foreign service until his resignation in 1964. 
He served as Minister to Burma In 1958, Director 
General of Information in late 1960, and Charge d' 
Affaires to the United States in 1963. 

In answer to whether our withdrawal 
would be a renegatloo of our promise to 
uphold the liberty of the South Vietnamese 
people, he stated, â¢ 'What they really want 
is peace." He also felt the American 
view that because the Vietnamese peasant 
Is illiterate he is politically deleoseless 
is wrong, 

"Any new government will be forced 
to be democratic. After 20 years of 
fighting the Vietnamese peasant is politi-
cally aware, knows his rights, and knows 
how to fight. He will not be oppressed," 

everything possible to get the VC to ne-
gotiate. This, in essence, is an admission 
of VC political power and failure In our 
objective. Van Dinh felt the essential 
question now Is how to stop all further 
senseless killing. 

The former ambassador believed the 
Vletnamization policy has great attraction 
to Americans because it seems to lead 

will find it necessary to fight the Ameri-
cans to prove theY're as nationalistic 
as the VC and North Vietnamese. 

The former cabinet position holder 
in the Diem government felt most of 
our negotiation problems stem from a 
misinterpretation of Hanoi's demands. He 
said Hanoi's position is that we accept 
the principle of withdrawal, which Is what 

He said the American goal should be 
reunification and not division of Viet 
Nam, It Is only in this way that the 
country can remain strong enough to 
maintain Independence of China and 
Russia. He felt the North Vietnamese 

. had maintained remarkable lndependence 

â¢ Why? 

Tran Van Dlnh in UCSD Gym 

of China conSidering they were fighting 
a war. 

Van Dlnh concluded by criticising the ' 
average American of being to apolitical 
in the past, and our tendency to let 
issues ride until it was too late. He 
said all Americans should reassess our 
foreign policy. "Any American mistake 
has many effects on many countries." 

China, U.S. at Odds The W ar isOver

"Communist China and the United States 

have not expressed congruency on any major 
international issue in the last twenty years. " 
General Victor H. Krulak said Tuesday in his 
lecture on Red China and America's future. 

He went on to say" A lesson that has been 
taught but never learned is that strength and 
nerve are the reallngredients of success with 
any confrontation with Communist power." 

" In dealing with Red China," he said, , the 
United States should first try to understand 
what they l!1'e trying to achieve as a nation." 
General Krulak considers those aims to be 
that: 

1. Red China wants to preserve her empire. 

head over heels in the nuclear business." 
"Red China believes that political power 
grows from the barrel of a gun." She has 
the technological capacity to and is producing 
nuclear weapons. "And this development 
should be a ponderable factor in the aUatrs 
of the world and how it can affect her neigh-
bors." 

"China is the oldest s tate in the world 
and she has a quarter of the population of the 
world. And she is sacrificing in every en-
deavor to invest over $3 billion in gaseous 
diffusion plants and is advancing fast towards 
thermo-nuclear weapons," 

General Krulak stated, " China says she 
does not want a nuclear war, but that we do. 
That the United States and Russia has forced 
her to develop nuclear weapons," 

William R. Corson is a former Maine Colonel and 
author of "The Betrayal: a report on the sabotage

Said the General, " The problem now con-
cerning us is what should we do about China? 
It is important to talk about mutual concerns 
right now. Either through formal dipolomatic 
relations, or a gradual broadening of econo-

with Red China we must first know how they

The war is over. 
The kids finally turned it around. 
And October 8th the Nixon Admintstra-

tion "put their tails between their legs" and 
pulled out. All that remains of the war are 
the mechanics of removing troops, machi-
nery, prisoners, and political knots-. 

William R. Corson put forth these opin-
ions on Wednesday night. 

Vietnam failed, he said, because it was a 
place to test theories , two theories, based 
on Truman's 22-year-old policy of defen-
ding national security. They were adopted 
by Kennedy, the "boy president" In 1961. 

First was the approach of WUliam Wal-

in view of other issues, creating dlffarent 
levels of guerilla warfare: global politics, 
insurgency vs. counter-insurgency, neo-
isolationism, and over-reaction. 

" It was all too difficult to follow, too 
easy to ignore. So it was ignored, he be-

, lieved. "Free men did not support the 
institutions. They became slaves to their 
own ambitions and charletons had a field-
day making a buck." 

"And we've got just what we've asked-
for. ' 

It could have been avoided. "What you 
need is a little hard work." " People need 
to think. The Y have to know where they 
want to go, bow, and why." 

As Robert E. Lee saId, Corson observed 

General Victor H. Krulak, USMC ret., is a 1934 
graduate of Annapolis. He has served both in China 
and the Pacific during World War II, and later in 
Korea. During an assignment as Commander of Marines 
In the Pacific, he made 54 trips to Vietnam. He re-
tired in 1968 and is currently Vice President of the

' Indra Devl, the world-re-
nowned author and teacher of 
Yoga, will visit UCSD at noon 
next We<mesday in front of the 
MC Cafeteria. 

She will speak on Yoga, her 
experiences and adventures In 
India and around the world, and 
will lead group Singing of Indian 
Balans. 

Tbe daughter of a Russian 
noblewoman and a SWedish bank 
director, the then Eugenle Peter-
son was born in the pre-World 
War I era. J Since 
early teens, she was Irresistibly 
drawn to India with its orienlal 
mysticism and ancient philoso-
phies. 

After becoming III fro m a 
grave heart condition, 
which Indra Devl suffered for 
over four years, she started 
taking the Yoga healing treat-
ments, and her healtb was re-
stored within one week. 

This prompted her to imme-
diately begin studying Yom. and 
she subsequently became the 
first occidental woman to ever 
teach Yoga in the country of its 
origin. It was there that she 
was g!v the name Indra Devl, 
which she now wears with the 
same dignity and grace with 
which she wears an Indian sari. 

At the suggestion of her tea-
cher, Shrl Krishnamacbarya, she 

opened a Yoga school in Shanghai, 
the first one in China. In spite 
of the war and the Japanese 
occupation of Shanghai, the en-
thusiastic Yoga leacher kept open 
the doors of her school even on 
the days when the city was 
bombed. 

As soon as the hostilities were 
over, Indra Devl returned to India 
where she was acknowledged as 
a Yoga teacher and was per-
suaded to write a book which 
was published there under tbe 
title "Yoga, tbe Technique 01 
Health and Happiness," wblch 
reawakened a wide in t ere s t 
among Indians for their once 
widespread science, art and 
philosophy of living. 

In 1947 Indra Devi sailed to the 
U.S, for a brief visit, but the 
civil strife In India caused her 
to remain in Los Angeles and 
open a school there. Among her 
numerous students were Aldous 
Huxley, Yehudi Menuhin, Greta 
Garbo and Robert Ryan. 

Her books, "Forever Young 
Forever Healthy," and "Yoga 
for Americans,' published by 
Prentice-Hall, were botb on tbe 
best seller lists in this country. 
Each of tbese books sold more 
than 100,000 copies, were trans-
lated into 10 languages and were 
sold in 13 countries. 

In 1957, the president of india 
presented Indra Devl with a gov-
ernment award tor the Sindhi 
translation of her first book. Her

Regents KickÂ·Off Tuition Fight 
by Tom Shepard 
Educ~tion~riter 

week's State Supreme Court decision, left 
tuition as the only controversial issue facing 
the Regents this month. 

Medical Center, presented a nine page report 
describing the effect tuition would have on 
students on his campus. 

The Regents of the University of Calif-
ornia, meetlng in Los Angeles, reopened the 
tuition controversy in a two-hour debate 
last Friday. 

The discussion of tuition took place amid 
fears of large-scale student demonstrations 
against the Regents' recent Angela Davis 
ruling. 

University Extension In downtown Los An-
geles, the site of the meeting, was surrounded 
by one of the most massive police deploy-
ments In Southern California history. Re-
gents Fred Dutton and William Roth des-
cribed the meeting place as "an armed 
camp. " 

Confrontation was forestalled, however, by 
a delay in action on the Davis case and 
the failure by UCLA students to attract more 
than 150 demonstrators despite free bus trans-
portation from the cross-town campus. 

The delay In action on Miss Davis's firing, 
which has been completely voided by tbis 

President Hitch had prepared a report 
for discussion on the alternative tuition plans. 
Actual debate on the institution of tuition 
was supposed to be postponed until the re-
port of the Coordinatlng Council on Higber 

. Education was submitted to the Regents, 
Hitcb had not even introduced his report 

before strenuous objections were registered 
by Regent Forbes. Forbes claimed It was 
"out of order to discuss tuition alternatives 
when the board has a policy of no tuition. " 

Hitch's report was ruled In order but his 
presentation was again interrupted by reports 
by ASUC Presidents from UCLA and San 
Francisco Medical Center. 

ASUCLA President Tom Normington cited 
the results ot a recent referendum on his 
campus which indicated that 63 per cent of 
the students voting on his campus would be 
hurt by tuition, and over 80 per cent op-
pose the institution of a tuition. 

Alex Stalcup, AS President from the S.F. 

Stalcup ~sted that tuition would result 
in a 100-300 per cent increase In requests 
for the already underfunded financial aid 
program. He also said lncreasededucational 
costs would force even more graduating 
physicians into high-paying, big-city 
practices and out of low-earning rural and 
ghetto practices, in order ~o payoff large 
debts incurred in medical school. 

The debate also touched on tbe eUects 
a tuition would have on the financial aids 
program. 

Governor Reagan contended that there is 
It a surplus of loan funds." University Vice-
President of Student Affairs Frank Kidner 
claimed there was in fact a shor tage of 
financial aid funds. 

Fred Dutton claimed tmt tuition would 
merely intensi!y the already-serious problem 
of access to UC by lower middle-class stu-
dents who neither have enough money nor 
qualify for financial aid. 

latest book, "Review Your Life 
Through Y 0 g a," describes the 
now-famous five-minute relaxa-
tion break, which Indra Devl 
first introduced into factories 
and buSinesses, helping to in-
crease production capacity of 
the workers almost 100 per cent 
and reduce absenteeism to a 
minimum. 

In 1960, Indra Devi made in-
ternational headlines by intro-
ducing Yoga to Russia. By invita-
tion of the Indian Ambassador, 
she gave a lecture to a group of 
Soviet 0 ff I c I a I s that included 
Mikoyan, Kosygln, and 40 cabinet 
members, thus becoming known 
as "the woman who introduced 
Yoga to the Kremlin ." 

Indra Devl is also responsible 
for bringing the message of Yoga 
to Japan, Thailand, Mexico and 
parts of the U.S., where it was 
little, if at all, known, Following 
numerous requests, sbe estab-
lished an International Yoga Cen-
ter in Tecate, Baja California. 

Indra Devi's coming next 
Wednesday will attempt to en-
courage the development of Yoga 
In the schools. She is sponsored 
by the Yoga Workshop, an intro-
ductory Yoga group 00 campus, 
which meets Monday and Wednes-
day mornings from 8 to 10 a .m. 
at MC 711, Recitation Hall.

Taking Drama to the People 
by Kathy Janson 
Staff Writer 

Noon on Moratorium Wednes-
day. 

The Revelle plaza was filled 
with people: speakers wearing 
ties, students carrying books and 
sandwiches, ladies with babies, 
bodies painted gold by the sun. 
The moritorium rally just began 
to disintegrate. 

Suddenly the atmosphere broke. 
People began running towards 

the microphone shouting "Peace 
declared. Peace declared!" 

Faces looked. Necks turned. 
"Go tell Nor th Vietnam!" an-

swered one of the crowd. 

Review 

Two fellows in white coats ush-
ered off the peace people. The 
guerrllla theatre was in action. 
A dozen actors med in command-
ing "Kill for Peace!" and creat-
'ing space for a stage in the middle 
of the plaza. The stage became 
a typical tack yard, complete 
with mothers hanging clothes and 
children playing. Mothers went 
off to watch their "Edge of Night" 
soap opera. The children con-
tinued playing a game, which grew 
into bickering and finally into war. 

"The idea of guerrilla thea-
tre," said Cunningham, " is to 
move in and move out quickly. 
It's got to catch people by sur-
prise." 

Openingb~~ A~~!lpevine 
Arts Editor 

Art Seidentaum has captured the issues of college life in California, 
and through his book, Â·Confrontation on Campus,Â· has tried to 
communicate the internal problems and feelings that are rarely 
expressed and often misunderstood by the parents of the college 
students. 

The book, the result of many months of travel and interviews 
will put parents on the inside track of some of the Important as~ 
pects of collegiate life. Seidenbaum points out that neither parents 
nor students trust the others to understand, and both withold in-
formation, attempting to Â·protectÂ· their relationships This book 
is his attempt to re-establish contact. 

The book is Uttle more than the reprint of the series of articles 
that appeared in West Magazine of the Los Angeles Times. In 
collection and retrospect, the emphasis of the articles changes 
from capturing a campus cross-section to involvement with the 
feelings and problems of California's generation of college students. 

The author's insight is, however, not perfect, He fails to discuss Â· 
soc ial issues. For example, to a large extent, the atmosphere 
of each college renects a frank, conscious pre-occupation with 
sex and the particular campus sexual social structure. This 
problem is discussed o~ly marginally. 

Dope is treated similarily. The problems of drugs are deper- , 
sonalized when the direct personal contact with users, and the ac-
tual use of drugs is a major force in undergraduate life. The 
effects of drugs is something that students copy if they do not 
experience. And furthermore, both sex and drugs add to the 
conspiracy of silence shown in parents and students. 

By the end of the book, it is apparent that the author, in attempting 
to aggressively defend the universities and their students, and to 
attack their false media- public images, has tried to strengthen 
his case by simplifying the problems of undergraduate life. 

Resistance to the draft, a crime. is discussed; yet knowledge 
of the use of dr ugs is as much a felony and is totally undiscussed. 
And dope represents a greater problem, because the faceless 
moral problem of the draft is hardly as difficult to judge as the 
use of drugs by a roomate with whom one is trying to live. To 
some extent, Seidenmum has committed the same error of which 
he accuses both students and pa.rents: -protecting each other 
from truth.' 

And yet, Seidenbaum touches deeply into the problems and con-
fusion of the undergraduate dilemna. His conclusions. are pro-
mbly the best points of departUJ;e pre sented In many years. The 
reviewer has never felt that any other journalist has really gone 
beyond the issues that confront the students as a time of crisis, 
to the crisis of the issues that the student faces constantly. The 
book goes beyond the reasons that bring the generation gap into I 
focus, and to focu s upon some of the reasons that form the gap. 

In the final chapter, Seidenbaum discusses the basis of student 
unrest. Correctly, he states that -removing one of the causes 
of campus unrest would alleviate the condition. But a solution 
in Vietnam would not bring the schools back to ivy-covered apathy; 
nothing will. That monotonous student word, relevance, is really 
an over-simplified code name for a new kind of higher education, 
one that has to be in and of the world rather than detached from 
tt. â¢ 

In this light he cautions administrators: "I don't pretend to 
have any disruption-proof notions but there are practices I would 
rather advocate: as long as kids and cops persist in seeing each 
other as natural enemies, they should be prevented from meeting 
during disturbance if at all possible." 

After a year of student watching, he also has advice for students, 
"Violence did not work in 1968-69. It produced arrests, explosions, 
opened skulls, deaths and repression, but hardly any advances 
in the pursuit . of virtue. Students, whose sense of history is not 
nearly as strong as their sense of injustice, had to see for them-
selves that violence hardens mens' minds instead of changing 
them.' 

After riots, hard words, hate and compounded problems, Seidenbaum 
affirms his faith in colleges and education, perhaps giving the 
best reason to try to preserve universities. 

-A campus is still the best place to teach someone how much he 
doesn't know and a school is probably still the best setting for 
a person to find his own sense of purpose.-

This book is a badly needed positive document. Give one to 
the parents for Christmas. 

Timing is important. Plays are 
only minutes in length, so the 
ideas conveyed must be concise 
and simple. Acting is heavy with 
repetition; mime and dialog must 
be loud enough to carry through 
the crowd. 

The player's develop the action 
from improvisation. 

"Out of maybe three fours of 
improvisation we'll get three 
minutes that are really good," 
said Cunningham. "We take these 
three minutes and build from 
there." And it is only through 
making up situations and' 'instinct 
of action" that the magic ofthose 
three minutes can tind itself. 

Performances are out-of-
doors where there is no stage, 
and therefore a sort of total 
stage. Since the theatre goes 
to the audience, instead of the 
other way around, the actors 

I have to scout beforehand for likely 
places to perform, places with 
lots of people and space are 
best 

The guerrilla theatre took their 
play to Horton Plaza (downtown 
San Diego), San Diego State Univ-
ersity, and Mesa Junior College. 

"It worked best at Mesa," 
said Cunningham, "It didn't come 
off as well here (UCSD) because 
everyone was expecting us. stu-
dents, in general, were pretty 
receptive. But at Horton Plaza 
we were dispersed by the police." 

It seemed that a special permit 
was necessary. It's a good thing 
that the idea is to move in and 
move out quickly.

Like many people at UCSD, I was interested in seeing what the 
new freshmen class would be like. I wanted to hear what they 
thought about UCSD, Reagan, SDS, Angela DaVis, and about those 
sex-starved Argo boys and their parties. 

So I decided to interview a UCSD freshman. I wanted to rap 
for awhile, and from this see what I could expect from this year's 
freshman class. 

He's a typical freshman, I guess. If you passed him on the way 
to class, you wouldn't especially notice him, nor would he notice 
you. 

But it's this that makes him a good subject for this column. 
Being black and an EOP (Educational Owortunities Program) 
student has not hurt him at all. He's as much a part of UCSD 
as is any other student. 

He went to high school in San Diego, and had average grades 
along with a varsity letter in football and track, although he wasn 't 
good enough to get any athletic scholarship offers. 

His parents aren't too wealthy, and therefore he started looking 
around at junior colleges. He was planning, he told me, to go to 
Mesa College. 

Enter Mr. Kern Carson, UCSD coordinator for EOP, Carson 
came to his high school and, in a few weeks, the prospective Mesa 
student suddenly became a UCSD student. To many of us here 
that doesn't mean much, but believe me, the dllference is enormous. 

I asked him about his feelings toward UCSD and his courses. 
He told me that he thought UCSD was fine; although he didn't know 
it too well yet. The classes he has are interesting, and he thinks 
that he is learning mor~ than he dId in high school. 

One course is Lit 2, an experimental class for third college. 
He had just read "Soul on Ice," and said he enjoyed it. His math 
and Spanish are <'okay," and for contemporary issues, he's taking 
a seminar entitled "Existential ReVOlution." I don't even know 
what that means! HB told me very matter-of-factly that "it is 
the individualist's role in the world." Oh! 

Then we discussed last year's referendum in which athletic 
scholarships were banned. I told . him that, if passed, he could 
have come here on an athletic scholarship. 

He thought for a moment and replied, "Yeah, but then I would 
have had an obligation to the team and coach. What if I decided 
not to play when I got here? I couldn't just quit." 

But he stays in shape. He Ills weights at the gym three times 
a week, and will play on the BSC intramural football ~eam. And 
he still might go out for track in the spring. He told me that 
athletics are much more fun this way. 

Then I asked him if EOP was worth it all, and about his feelings 
toward the "no" vote on athletic scholarships. 

He was all for EOP, and pointed out to me that he could have 
been at Mesa right now. He wished, though, that more of his friends 
and more of all minority groups could get the same deal that he 
has now. 

A very humanitarian thought for a freshman. If more freshmen 
are like this, if more are existential revolutionaries, then UCSD, 
and the world, have a bright future ahead.

The UCSD cross country team 
won its fourth straight meet Sat-
urday, outrulUllng three teams 
on the Tritons' home course. 

The score was UCSD 21; San 
Diego Track and Field Club "B" . 
34; Navy Seal Team 94; and Cal 
Lutheran College 100. Members 
of the SDT&F "c" team and 
the Seniors Track Club also par-
ticipated. 

Jerry King was the individual 
winner for the Tritons, with a 
time of 27:05 on the mountainous 
4.6-mile course. Teammates Ed 
Avol and Randy Twombly were 
right behind King, taking second 
and t h i r d. Twombly was the 
most-Improved runner, clipping 
almost a minute off his previous 
best. 

The San Diego Track and Field 
Cluh had a stand-out performer 
in distance ace Bob Wllson, but 
the aging speedster could only 
manage fourth place behind the 
swifter Tritons. 

Rounding out the UCSD score 
were Clark Rosen, seventh, and 
Bob Horgan, eighth.

Water Polo' A Fast Action Sport 

Though water polo Is relatively 
unknown in America, it is one of 
the most exciting competitive 
sports in existence. In Europe, 
water polo Is widely known, well 
liked, and supported with almost 
as m u c h wild enthusiasm as 
soccer. 

Played by seven-man teams 
(three forwards, three guards, 
and a goalie), it is one of the 
fastest moving games around, 
It can be played In almost any 
ordinary SWimming pool, but col-
legiate rules require a pool at 
least 25 yards long. Two goals 
are used at opposite ends at the 
pool. The rules are similar to 
soccer. 

Water polo is a demanding 
sport. It is phYSically exhausting 
and requires lightning-fast reac-
tions and movements by every 
player. A good water polo player 
must have strong arms for pass-

. ing, s w i m min g, and shooting; 
strong legs for support; a good 
head on his shoulders; several 
years previous experience in the 
sport and a lot of endurance. 

Players are not allowed to 
touch the bottom of the pool when 
in control at the ball (except for 
the goalie) . Endurance Is es-
pecially a lac tor when the game 
is played in a pool with no 
shallow end--as in the Olym-
pics. 

The object of the game is to 
get the ball into the opposing 
team's goal, which Is more dif-
ficult than It sounds. 

The rules of the game slightly 
favor the defense. A defender 
can attack any offensive player 
to get the ball, If the man on 
the offensive is touching the ball 
in any way. A defender guarding 
a man without the ball can still 
gullT'rl him verv close. to pre-

1. Purple Gophers 

Gophers have two wins; the 
leading 1M scorer, Borth, with 
40; and the leading 1M passer,

should be virtually unstoppable 
in the Revelle League.

6. Rubber Band 

Definitely a fine passer with 
good receivers, but absolutely 
no line. 
7. Cabrones 

The annihilation of a poor team 
demonstrates this team's exper-

real strength.

vent him from 'gettlng 'free, but 
he cannot "attack" as if his 
man had the ball. So for a team 
to score against a good defense, 
they must employ a series of 
quick movements, designed to 
get one of their men free. 

A good offense will actually 
have c e r t a I n pre-determined 
plays they will use to fake-out 
the defense and free one of their 
men momentarUy--hope!ully in 
front of the goal--so that they 
have an extremely good chance 
to score when the ball Is passed 
to the free man. 

UCSD's team improving greatly 

UCSD's collegiate water polo 
team is beginning to realize the 
full potential of each player and 
of the team. Through long hours 
of practice the team has buut 
up the endurance and gained the 
experience essential to a good 

team. 
Their efforts were r ewarded 

last weekend at the all-Cal water 
polo tourney when they d.efeated 
UC Riverside 4-2 in a grudge-
match against a team that had 
defeated them twIce previously 
this season. Hard work and de-
termination of the team was re-
sponsible for the victory. 

Sta r t e r s Jim stoner, Gary 
Becker, Jim Wiens, Doug Che-
Shire, E IIi 0 t t Uchiyama. Hal 
Handley, and Dennis Revie were 
h a pp y with the results. J im 
Stoner, the freshman boy-wonder 
from Corona del Mar, played so 
well throughout the tournament 
that he was named on the AlI-
Tournament team. 

One can onl y learl so much 
from an article. I suggest going 
to a game to see what it Is 
really like. The next home game 
is Nov. 5, against San Diego 
State, at 3:30 p.m.

state Superintendant of Educa-

tion Max Rafferty stated Tuesday 
that he hoped by the time the 
Pacht ruling reached th.~ Supreme 
Court "Nixon will have put Su-
preme Court justices who will 
interpret the written law instead 
of the law as they would like to 
see it." 

The UC Board of Regents anti-
Communist hiringplicythatJudge 
Pacht declared unconstitutional in 
Superior Court Monday dates back 
to 1940 when Kenneth May, a 
teaching assistant in mathematics 
on the Berkeley campus, was fired 
for being a member of the Com-
munist party. Then in June, 1942, 
the Regents adopted a resolution 
requiring all employees to sign 
an aoth swearing to uphold the US 
and State Constitutions. 

In March, 1949, the Regents ad-
ded the requirement that all em-
ployees must also state that "Ido 
not believe in and I am not a mem-
ber or nor do I support any party 
or organization that believes in, 
advocates, or teaches the over-
throw of the US Government by 
force or by any illegal or uncon .. 
stitutional methods." 

A major dispute was touched 
off by the 1949 Regents' action, 
the most jarring in UC history. 

Contracts were witheld from 
professors who refused to sign 
the loyalty oath. F or several 
months committees of Regents 
and faculty members attempted to 
resolve the dispute. 

Both the northern and southern 
divisions of the Academic Senate' 
did support the anti-Communist 
hiring policy by large majorities 
in mail ballots in 1950. By a 
10-10 vote that year, the Regents 
refused to rescind the oath. 

As a result, 36 tenured pro-
fessors were fired, including se-
veral with major reputaUons,and 
157 non-tenured professors and 
s taff members were also fired. 

This political purge was the 
largest in the history of American 
higher education and resulted in 
censure of the University of Cali-
fornia by the American Assn. of 
University Professors. 

From 1950 until the present 
Angela Davis case, there has been 
no clear cut challenge to the anti-
Communist plicy. 

According to David Gardner, 
vice chancellor at UC Santa Bar-
bara and author of a history of 
the loyalty oath controversy, the 
issue throughout the controversy 
was not so much the oath itseU 
as it was the anti-Communist hi-
ring policy, and, even more, the 
fundamental issue of who runs the 
university--the Regents or the fa-
culty. 

Pacht, known to have a liberal 
reputation on the bench, has also 
been known as an advocate for the 
rights of the individual. In his 
private law practice, one of his 
last cases before becoming a ju-
rist involved representing a tea-

St4IutaIut 

cber who bid beendeDildcreden-
tials because be admitted past 
CommUDist Party membership. 
The teacher would not sign an 
affidavit swearing that he dkl not 
advocate overthrow of the Gov-
ernment by force. 

More recently, the judge made 
a decision in which 1>08 held that 
a student organization at Glen-
dale College had the right to in-
vite a Black Panther leader to ad-
dress the group. 

Ironically, Judge Pacht was as-
signed to the Davis case only af-
ter the Regent's attorneys las 
filed an a1fidavit of prejudice on 
the originally assigned judge, R0-
bert Kenny.

Bill Keegan is a R.A. in Argo. 

He has worked on the Interhall

. Rent S'r;le 

Protest at the Berkeley campus 
currently centers around the high 
rents imposed upon the students. 

The rent stike kicked off last 
week with a mass meeting of over 
700 people on Oct. 14. In a 
telephone interview with Jerry 
Popkin of the Daily Cal, however, 
it was pointed out that the strike 
won't become effective until the 
Berkeley tenants reach a certain 
level of agreement on withholding 
their rent. 

Organizers are largely people 
who were active in the People 's 
Park Defense Committee last 
spring. "They claim they've been 
organizing block to bloCk,Â· said 
Popkin. "We haven't seen too 
much evidence of that at all."

Planned NonÂ·Parentllood 
or "onÂ·Planned Parenthood 

by Dana Rufol0 Staff Writer 
At last UCSD bas a birth control clinic. starting the first Mooday 

in November, and on every Monday evening thereafter, qualified 
medical staff from San Diego's Planned Parenthood Association 
will come to the camlX1S. The clinic will take place at the UCSD 
Medical Health Service fac1l1ty. Approximately 40 persoos will be 
counseled at each session. 

The Planned Parenthood clinic here will give free examinations 
and birth control pills or devices to all persoos who have previously 
made an appointment. This means that anyooe in the area of UCSD, 
student or non-student, regardless of age, need only telephone the 
downtown office and request to attend the clinic. 

The idea of a birth control clinic began last April with Dean 
Murphy. The Women's Liberation Front came to Dean Murphy 
shortly after with a proposed pIan and requested that student health 
perform such services. However, the additional cost, calculated 
at $25,000, made the suggestion that the university open a free 
birth control clinic infeasible. Interest in such an idea continued 
to grow among the community, however, and under the direction 
of Dr. Watson and headnurse Mrs. Rice, Planned Parenthood 
was informed of UCSD's need. 

ALIBABA 

FREAKS OUT AT 

SYNTHETIC 
TRIPS Dean Murphy . sees this campus extension of Planned Parenthood as merely an "interim device." Not only will Planned Parenthood . 

be financially unable to provide for the entire community's needs 
in the future when their federal granUrom the Department of Health, 
Education and Welfare expires, but also Dean Murphy . envisions 
the Medical Health Center as a place where, ideally, "students 
feel free to go no matter what their problem." Eventual working 
relations with the Medical School allowing for exchange of personnel, 
and Student Health expansions to include specialists, should in the 
coming years allow for full-time birth control services for UCSD. 
Presently, only Dr. Holcrum, a gynecologist, is connected with the 
UCSD Health Service for four hours a week. He treats students for 
infections only and will continue in this specialized capacity even 
after the birth control clinic opens this November.
