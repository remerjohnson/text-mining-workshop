Gov.'s Budget 
Update Keeps 

Fee Buyout 
Schwarzenegger's 
budget similar to 
original college funding

The state Legislature's top 
policy analyst office is maintain -
ing its original criticisms of Gov. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger's state bud-
get - revised by the governor last 
week - which still keeps millions 
in funding to buy out an increase of 
student fees at both the University of 
California and the Californja State 
Uniftnity. 

Under Schwarzenegger's revised 
budget - similar to his original 
prop08als for higher education - a 
windfall of state revenue will be used 
to provide $75 million to UC cam-
puses in order to .ave students from 
a planned 8-percent fee increase.

Five-percent inflation 
slated for next year. 
Increases have slowed 
since 2002.

The cost of puking permits is 
scheduled to incM" by 5 percent 
next academic yar to fund addi-
tional parking facilit.ies, increases 
in alternative transportation pro-
grams and in investment technol-
ogy, according to Greg Snee, the 
director of planning and ana1yais 
at Transportation and Parking 
Services. 

Though the increue is smaller 
than in recent years, there is no 
predictable end to rising prices, 
aince parking fees contribute to the 
growth of UPS. In the 2003-04 
school year, parking fees rose by 10 
percent, followed by an 8-percent 

increase in 2004-05 and a 5-percent 
increase in 2005-06. 

Under the UC Master Plan 
of 1960, T&PS is designed to be 
entirely self-supporting, and UCSD 
parking permit holders fund not 
only construction cost. and fmanc-
ing of facilities, but also the opera-
tional colli including maintenance, 
utilities and security. 

Snee blamed construction costs 
for the file hike, explaining thlll 
the conllnJction of parking facili-
ties is very expensive. Hopkins 
Parking Structure, currently under 
conatruc:tion at the comer of Voist 
Drift and Hopkins Drive, will cost 
approximately $30 million. 

The 1,400 new parking spaces 
created in this facility will each cost 
about $20,000, according to Snee. 

Many commuters haft ' been 
frustrated by the riling parking 
prices. which they uid are excessive 
because of the time and distance it 
still takes to traftl from a parking 
lot to a lecture hall.

ThlJJ100d Marshall College senior 
Kalia Stanford said 

Stanford suggested that there be 
different parking fee levels for spots 
close to campus and spots in the 
Regents and East lots, which require 
a shuttle trip to campus and there-
fore should baft reduced rates. 

"I undentand thlll it's difficult

CONTRIBUTINC WRITE R 

Tbe UC Board of Regents fmaUy 
outlined concrete reforms - made 
in an effort to "dean up" and abate 
concerns following public inves-
tigations into the University of 
California's compensation practices 
- of the university's current pay 
policies. 

During the board's meeting. UC 
President Robert C Dynes accepted 
much of the blame for the scandal. 
where the unjversity and state audi-
tors found that many top employees 
receiftd bonuses and perks against 
UC policy. 

"In the Office of the President, 
for a decade or longer, there has been 
a view that benefJtS'(leIegated to me 
did not have to be included in lists 
of compensation; Dynes said -It's 
wrong. it's inexcusable, but it is a 
fact. This will not bappen again. Not 
anymore." 

Dynes outlined a five-point plan 
of action that would implement 
the findings of a task force on UC 
compensation policies. Dynes' plan 
showed his intent to establish a new 
and better working relationship with 
the Board of Regents and ensure 
compliance with the task force's rec-
ommendations and proper disclo-
sure to the public. 

Overhauled A.S. Budget Aims to Streamline Org Funding The president also announced concrete goals, including investment in a better humanrresources infor-

A.S. President Harry Khanna's funding proposal 
indudea a wboIe new look to the A.S. Council's mul-
timillion-dollar budget, meant to cut -red tape- and 
eue financial policies that some student organiza-
tions complain are too complicated. 

The new budget proposal includes an increue in 
unaIlocllled money for student organizations, which 
Khanna said is aimed at eliminating the barriers that 
organizations face when trying to holl events on 
campus. Under the current policy, the A.S. Council 
allocates much of the money to the collese councils, 
which then distributes it to the student organiza-
tions. According to Khanna, cutting the amount of 
money thlll previously went to the coIleF councils 
wit mab it more convenient for organizations hold-
ing off-campua e¥ents to receift money. 

Khanna also reinstituted service stipends and 
increased AS. eRCWYe office stipends in his pro-
posa1. which he said wiD ~'aIl outside job distrac-
tions and encoUJ18e a full-time commitment. 

"Money should not be a barrier thlll pmatts ... 
officers from getting involved; Khanna said 

During this and last yar's A.S. e1ections, two-
time can~e and Earl Warren College senior 
Daniel Watts criticized stipends giftn to A.S. offi-
cers, and said the money was spent wastefully 
instead of being made available to students. Tbis 
)Uf, former A.S. President Christopher Sweeten 
cut S«Vice stipends, distributed to administrators 
in student services such as Student-Run Television, 
from the budget. 

"I think (this] year's cutting was a mistake; 
Khanna said 'f eervices are paid then (the employ-
eel will act and feel like an emplo~ who has the 
support of the administndion." 

Despite decreased use of A.S. Safe Ride this year 
- after a funding increase in last years bu. -
Khanna still proposed allocating the same $27,000 
to the program, which provides free transporta-
tion home on certain n1gIts to aily UCSD student 
who hu sIped up, particularly those who are too 
inebriated to drive. Khanna said consistent funding 
will allow the program to return to the "sticlcer sys-

Although UC officials disputed

A lthough it's only been in offICe for two weeks on paper, busi-ness of the new A.S. Council

meeting a distinct "out with the old in 
with the new" feel. 

The council caucus, proposed by 
Revelle College Senior Senator Rachel 
Cord. revolw:d around the efficiency 
of starting the new counciltenns in the 
middle of spring quarter. CoreU wanted 
the council's opinion on either allow-
ing elected officials to Hnish off the 
academic year in their positions and 
starting the new council in the fall, or 
keeping things the way they are now. 

-Cl1anging mid-quarter seems to 
cause a lot of ruckus; Corell said 

She said that transitioning was espe-
cially difficuh for outgoing senior sena-
tors. who are often split between pre-
paring to graduate as well as finishing 
off any last-minute senator projects. 

"l think it's rea1Iy important to have 
a set group of people you're work-

"That's a record!' Lam said proudly, 

to cheers and hoots from other coun-
cilmem ben. 

However, not everyone seemed to 
be approving gf the newer, more func-
tional council. An unidentified student 
decided to provide his valuable opinion 
of how the council is run, screaming 
out "A.S. blows!' in the middle of a 
report being giw:n by VICe President 
External Eddie limen. The bedder 
continued to walk by the Price Center 
ballroom and was unavailable for corn-
men\. 

For now. it seems that this council is 
handling complex matters with smiles 
on its faces - but never fear drama 
lovers, there's always the possibility of 
more run-by philosophy around the 
corner.

require transparency. 

I n addition, the board approved 
motions to create and maintain an 
advisory committee composed of 
administrators, faculty and staff from 
the Office of the President. 

While Dynes did not ellCU5e the 
policy infraaions. he said that the 
money spent on compensation was 
the result of a university need to 
remain competitive. 

"I'm driven by the fact that we 
must recruit the best ind the bright-
est in faculty and admiliistrators; 
Dynes said "We must be competi-
tive in the context of being a public 
institution.' 

Dynes explained that his desire to 
remain competitive with private uni-
versities led him to make under-the-
tallie arrangements with the possible 
adm inistrative recruits. 

"We didn't invent [extra com-
pensation)~ Dynes said "In the last 
10 years, privates have gotten richer, 
publics have gotten poorer. When 
1 came to my presidency, 1 realized 
I had to hire as many as five or 
six chanu:Uors. so we've been in a 
recruiting mood." 

Dynes also argued that the uni-
w:rsity's commitment to excellence 
caused him to use what he called 
"dysfunctional" practices. In pursuing 
the universitys top-choice adminis-

trators, Dynes was reluctant to offer 
prospective candidates Ies.~ than they 
could receive at other institutions. 

'We don't intend to enrich peo-
ple in recruiting them. but we don't 
intend to ask: people to take substan-
tial decreases in their compensation; 
Dynes said 

While many lawmakers are 
pushing for UC President Robert C. 
Dynes to resign from his position in 
response to the fmdings, Dynes, as 
well as the regents' board, has given 
no indication that he will be ousted 
from his presidency.

Authority Lies at Heart of 
UCSD Athletics' Future 

Every few years, campus administrators inevitably ask students to raise their own fees to pay for services that the 
university should have already 
been providing in the first 
place. 

For example, students will 
soon pay for an expanded Price 
Center (so the chancellor and 
her staff can 'move into the cur-
rent one). And they must sub-
sidize a thletic facilitie , even 
though, until last year, students 
had no say over their opera-
ti ons - a direct violation of 
the requirements of university 
policy. . 

Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Joseph W. Watson's pro-
posed athletics referendum -
to bailout an indebted depart-
ment that oversees the school's 
NCAA teams 

actually increase attendance . 
However, the idea has been 
nixed by Watson, who has 
continued to resist alcohol at 
cam pus even ts. As a result, he 
now wants students to bear 
the cost for this philosophical 
intractability. 

Similarly, the bitter reality 
is that if athletics are truly a 
priority that students are will-
ing to pay for, the department 
could simply charge them a fee 
for attending games, a fund-
ing model used by many other 
major universities.

[n our view, if 
administrators 

to keep athletics out of the red, 
while at the same time refusing 
to cede any authority to them 
or institute safeguards against 
the necessity of a similar bail-
out in the future. 

Recently, Watson . has sug-
gested that the future of UCSD 
sports is in the hands of stu-
dents. However, the truth is 
that whether students fork 
ove r an extra $300,000 a year 
will depend on decisions to be 
made by Watson . 

The Case for a 'No' Vote 
[n recent years, students 

twice voted to reject higher 
fees, first to pay for student-
initiated outreach, and then, 
last m o nth , to increase funding 
for A.S. programming. Unlike 
athletics, which , quite honest-
ly, most care little about, the 
two failed referenda dealt with 
issues ncar and dear to student 
hearts. 

[f s tudents have money with 
which they are willing to part, 
the A.S. Council can surely 
fi nd a more important use for 
it than athletics. Nor is the 
situation as dire for the ath-
letics department as Watson 
suggests. 

For example, the depart-
m ent had previously mulled 
expanding beer gardens at 
various ho me games - a pro-
posal that would surely bring 
in some badly needed cash and 

want students to shoulder the 
responsibilities for financing 
sports, they must also allow 
them to have some of the privj -
leges. 

These privileges should 
come in the form of a new 
board - on which students 
would have a majority - to 
oversee the athletics depart-
ment, preferably with author-
ity to hire and fire its director. 
A similar model (sans firing 
authority) is currently used for 
most projects funded by the 
students, including University 
Centers and the athletic facili -
ties. 

Under such a system, if bud-
get deficits were to <;ontinue, 
at least students could take 
comfort in knowing that they 
had a say in the process, and 
that they themselves - not just 
university staff members, with 
no input from or accountabil-
ity to students - were at fault. 
Even better, there would be 
actual student represen tatives 

'who could be held accountable 
by students for the mismanage-
ment. 

Granted, the creation of such 
a board will not ensure the pas-
sage of the athletics referendum. 
However, without it, students 
should surely reject it. 

Until he decides to offer 
students a seat at the table, 
the future of UCSD athletics 
remains in Watson's hands.

A DROP FROM THE INKWELL By Riley Salant-Pearce 

Freedom to L~am Requires Free Access 
By Nataslta Naraghl 

STAFF WRITER 

Some things are better free - especially information. But even here in a country 
that advertises forward thought, 
our metbod of disclosing scholarly 
research rem ains primitive. It's well 
past time we revamp the system 
of scattered articles in various pri-
vate joum als tbat charge readers 
through subscriptions. 

. Fortunately, Sen. Joseph 
Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Sen. 
lohn Cornyn (R-Texas), hope to 
change the current system with a 
law that would provld,e the public 
with long-deserved free access to 
scholarly journals six months after 
their publication date. An article in 
the New York Times R!ported that 
all "articles that contained research 

,fmanced by federal grants' would 
then be published online through a 
government Web site. 

According to tbe National 
Sciem;e Board, the discretionary 
federal budget for 2006 has set aside 
5132.3 billion to spend on research 
and development, approximately 
13.6 percent ohhe total projected 
budget. With taxpayers funding 
the majority of national. research, it 
seems logical and fair that they be 
entitled to view the results of their 
investment without tbe additional 
charge of subscribing to a scholarly 
journal. 

Tbe implementation would also 
cut university costs by sparing it 
subscriptions too online scholarly 
journal databases such as ISTO R. 
Considering many of the a:Jticies 
published in these databases rely 
on federally funded researcb, it is 
preposterous that a public univer-
sity like UCSD should have to pay 
the one-time archive capital fee of 
$45,000 and the annual archive fee 
of $8,500 to use the database. 

These are only figures for 
the JSTOR Arts and Sciences I 
Collection (of which there are sev-
eral parts), and )STOR is only one 
of the many online databases uni-
versity students use. Students could 
easily agree that this money is beller 
spent elsewhere. 

Moreover, free access to scholar-
ly articles would increase readership 
of the information , since tbose pre-
Viously unwilling to pay Y1e charge 
would no longer be forced to do 
so. It 's a simple mailer of econom-
ics: Decrease the price, increase the 
demand. 

Pree online availability will also 

help to hike readerilhlp because 
many citizens do not have easy 
access to a library to view these 
journals due to transportation or 
time constraints. Coupled with tbe 
free propagation of the informa-
tion and a more Simplified process 
of access, the program bears a real 
chance for success at reaching a 
broader audience. 

And when It comes to educating 
the masses and moving forward as 
a nation through scientific develop'- ' 
ment, tbe free exchange of ideas is 
the most vital nutrient for growth. 
It's hard to argue against incteasing 
the demand for knowledge. 

But the list of positive externall-

terms of public 
efit, it's imperative 
that tax money 
never be poured 
into a black hole 

with taxpayen left 
to wonder about its 

fate. Rather, a system 
of accountability for 
both the government 
and the researchers 
needs to be set in 

place." 
lies to such an implementation does 
not e!ld here. 

Tbe Web site's abilily to com-
pile information in one area would 
also make it easier for readers to 
sift through various topics, whereas 
before they would have been forced 
to subscribe to several subject-spe-
cilk journals. A consolidated data-
base would also prevent duplicate 
research and more effiCiently allow 
scientists to build on the ideas of 
one another. 

There's no end to the positive 
results an implementalion of this 
policy would produce. In terms of 
public benefit, it's imperative that 
tax money never be poured into 
a black hole with tupayers left to 
wonder about its fate. Rather, a 
system of accountablHty for both 
the government and the researchers 
needs to be set in pl.~. 

Bestowing access to the public 
for information they pay for bell'S 
to prevent the misuse of funding by 
researchers and holds them account-
able for completing qUality research 
that is relevant to the public. 

Of course, with change comes 
opposition. In this case, tbe prospect 
of losing business from a decline in 
subscriptions and ad revenue bas 
journal publisbers fretting. . 

Por Howard Garrison, the 
dlrector of public affairs at the 
Federation of American Societies 
for Experimental Biology, a new law 
is reason to worry, as bis organiza-
tion publishes roughly 60 journals, 
according to an article in the New 
York Times. 

·People won't be able to gauge 
how many people will be R!ading 
the articles and that has ramillca-
lions for advertising, promotion; 
Garrison said. "Does it reach 1,000 
scientists, 2,000 scientists or 50? If 
the articles are on a government 
Web site, your readership may be 
halved." 

But this is likely a case of profit-
seekers making much ado about 
nothing. 

It's ve'ry possible many scientists 
will want to keep their subscriptions 
so as to stay up to date with current 
developments. The rapid pace of 
science and technological growth 
is likely to discourage them from 
waiting six months to view the free 
articles online, which ougbt to quell 
some publisber's fears. 

This is somewhat of a unique 
case, and opponents might argue 
that the government prOViding a 
service instead of the private sphere 
will lead to an ineffiCiency in tbe 
market. In addition, all taxpayers 
and not just the interested few will 
have to bear tbe cost of maintain-
ing the online database regardless 
of their level of interest in scholarly 
research. 

In this situation, the costs of 
publishing the art.icles, either 
through journals or through an 
online database, is small compared 
to the over $100 .billiollobudget for 
research. An online database might 
also be cheaper to maintain than 
private journals that .require decent 
staffs. 

Whoever pays, tbe cost will be 
roughly the same. The only differ-
ence Is that when the government 
heads the operatlon, more will ben-
efit, both from the Infonnation luelf 
and from the positive externalities 
such u technological and ac:icntlfic 
in novallon.

ucls they market are often completely 
unrelated to one another, so the brand 
(and its logo) associates them with an 
ideology that consumers have been 
trained (by ads, etc.) to recognize. 
But there's nothing inherently sin-
ister about brands - in fact they're 
incredibly useful. which is why every-
one, including nonprofrt groups and 
universities, try to develop them. 

So Blackspot is a brand similar 
to any otber, but with an ideology 
based on principles of soc ial jus-
tice and responsibility rather than 
profit-making and domination. One 
aspect of the effort is truly progres-
sive. By participating in the global 
fasbion market, Adbusters acknowl-
edges a reality that lefty radicals have 
long seemed scared to face: The only 
way to exert influence in the system 
of global capitalism is 10 change its 
course from the inside, to harness 
the magnillcent abilily of free mar-
kets to effect massive change and 
get them to change things for the 
better. If Blackspot's success makes it 
severely uncoolto be unfamiliar with 
the working conditions of the perSon 
wbo made your shoes, if it instilled 
social responsibility as a cornerstone 
of po.stmociem hipness, that would be 
changing things for the better. 

Yet Adbusters and Blackspot seem 
too busy constructing an absolutely 
"anti-corporate" ideology of cool to 
reali2e that they're also constructing 
a corporation and a brand - one 
with mindfucking advertisements as 
provocative and powerful as those of 
Coke or McDonalds (see eplgrapb). 
Adbusters apparently hasn't realized 
that its main struggle should not 
be against branding as a marketing 

strategy, but rather the um;rilicaI con· 
swnption of any brand ideology by 
Ihe consumer. 

This is lhe challenge identified by 
the Times with the remark that "those 
most sympathetic to the mission 
might also be those most hostile 10 
the idea of a brand as an antidote 10 
the ills of consumer culture; except 
the magazine got II backwards. The 
biggest trouble for the company will 
be ensuring that it doesn't become 
just another fashionably rebellioljs 
label bought without thought wben 
the less-than -revolutionary masses 
get turned on. 

Figuring out how to be a su cess-
ful consumer product without shrink-
ing into meaninglessneSl> like Che 
Guevara T-shirts and Chuck Taylors 
is a revolution for which Blackspot 
currently lacks sufficienl self-aware-
ness. It's great to tout the.health and 
happiness of one's workers, but when 
those life values get translated into a 
manipulative sales pilch - fight the 
man - how are the company's meth-
ods any more progressive than Coke's 
"Real" campaign or McDonalds' " I'm 
Lovin'It"? 

A truly revolutionary brand -
and such a thing is possible - would 
empower the consumer to always 
question the perpetually absolutist 
ideolOgies sold along with brands, 
and also produce its goods in a social-
ly responsible manner. Kicking "toxic 
megacorporations in the brand; 
while at the same time selling a com-
peting one, may fashionize nicely 
made goods. but it's an ideology that 
can't stand up against the vast sponge 
of consumer desire wben, ineVitably, 
it gets sucked in.

'Top State Analysts Back Scrutiny of Outreach 
~ BUYOUT, from page 1 
the state economy;" 

In November, the UC Board 
of Regents approved a 5492 fee 
increallC from this year, requiring 
students to pay a total of $6,633 
in mandatory system fees. A provi-
sion within the proposal, however, 
allowed the regents to rescind the 
increase if the Legislature approved 
SchwarzenesFr's plan. 

Since 2000, fee levels have almost 
doubled. with about a IO-percent 
hike each year. Such fee predict-
ability - outlined In a 2004 com-
pact between former Gov. Gray 
Davis Uld UC President Robert C. 
Dynes - would be destroyed by 
Schwarzenegger's proposal. accord-
ing to Boilard. 

"The state continues to lack a pol -
icy for setting fees,· he said. "There's 
absolutely no gradual predictability 
to fees, and no way to see what is 
down the road, especially with this 
latest budget ." 

Stae Assembly Speaker Uld ex-
ofticio Regent Fabian Nutlez has said 
Schwarzenegger's buyout would ben-
efit both students Uld the state. 

·Putting money into the UC is 
like inve51ment," Nutlez spokesman 
Richard Stapler said "The university 
is a huge econom ic generator for the

versity system ~ be said 

Although re-evaluation is needed. 
the LAO said that completely cutting 
funding to outreach programs might 
be too extreme. 

"In my mind. it's pretty clear that 
some of these outreach programs are 
more effective than others," Boilard 
said "But there are so mUlY mov-

ing parts to these programs, and it 
seems to me reasonable that there 
CUI be many improvements to these 
progfUllS. Unfortunately, it's been an 
all or nothing approach when it comes 
to funding." 

Critics have pUlned the univer-
sity for not establishing a direct link 
between academic success and out-
reach programs. 

However, some politicians say 
that outreach is an essential tool 
for retention and recruitment of a 
diverse student body. State Sen. Jackie 
Speier (D-SUI Francisco/San Mateo), 
who sits on the Senate Education 
Committee. lauded outreach efforts 
such as the Preuss School, UCSD's 
charter school that en rolls disadvan-
t:lged students. 

"This is a school where disadvan-
taged high school students graduate 
at a rate of 90 peKent and the major-
ity of them go on to a UC school,· 
Speier said "That's a phenomenal 
story that should be heralded, not 
criticized."

current punch-card system was not 
only poorly advertised. but inconve-
nient becwse it forced students to visit 
the A.S. oftkes on the third floor of

Additionally, Khanna created a

annual events that have consistently 
attracted at least 300 students for 10 or

According to Vice President

plUl is better because it will prevent 
the Student OrganU.ation Funding 
Advisory Board and the A.S. finance 
committee from facing roadblocks in 
allocating as much money as possible 

to student organizations. Currently, 
the A.S. Council must vote and

prevents more funding to student

a resolution in support of the ~s

organized carpools to take students to

Maya Angelou Not Met 
With Due Respect 

Dear Editor: 
1 recently attended "An Evening 

with Maya Angelou" at RIMAe A 
techn leal error or two in an event is 
unfortunate, though excusable. But 
problems went so far beyond harm-
less mistakes that I doubt Angelou 

would accept an invitation to come 
back. It began with sound problems. 
The only people who tould inlt ialIy 
hear Angelou were those in the very 
front seats. After some time the sound 
was fIXed. but M still bad to strain 
our ean to hear her. The min who 
Introduced her spoke very quickly, 
and though I could not hear what he 
Slid, I could see that he was starin8 
down at the podium the entire time. 
1 am surprised that the university did 
not seek out a better publJc'speaIrer to _ 
Introduce a world-renowned, incred-

ib�e woman. Furthennore, the lights 
on the wdIence were never dimmed, 
and the spotlight on Angdou Mill out 
severaJ times. People were still flood-
ing in, stomping down the bleachers. 
well into the first half-hour of her 
speech. Not only is this dlsruptM 
to the audience members, it is rude 
to any speaker. The ~nt concluded 
with no closing speaker or thank you, 
no bouquet of flOMrS, no display of 
kindness or gratitude. I left enchanted 
by the words 1 could discern, but 
ashamed to be a student of this unl~­
sity. 1 hope that the next time UCSD 
receives such an hono~ guest, he or 
she will be \realed with respect.

the state economy." 

In November, the UC Board 
of Regents approved a 5492 fee 
increase from this year, requiring 
students 10 pay a lotal of 56,633 
in mandatory system fees. A provi-
sion within the proposal, however, 
allowed the regents to rescind the 
increase if the Legislature approved 
Schwarzenegger's plan. 

Since 2000, fee levels have almost 
doubled, with about a 10-percent 
hike each year. Such fee predict-
ability - outlined in a 2004 com-
pact between former Gov. Gray 
Davis and UC President Robert C. 
Dynes - would be destroyed by 
Schwanenegger's proposal, accord-
ing to Boilard. 

"The state continues to lack a pol -
icy for setting fees; he said. "There's 
absolutely no gradual predictability 
to fees, and no way 10 see what is 
down the road, especially with this 
latest budget." 

Stale Assembly Speaker and ex-
offICio Regent Fabian Nu/lez has said 
Schwarzenegger's buyout would ben-
efit both students and the slate.

ties in the overall budget for the uni-
versity sySlem; he said 

Ahhough re-evaluation is needed, 
the LAO said that completely cutting 
funding to outreach programs might 
be too extreme. 

"In my mind, it's pretty clear thai 
some of these outreach programs are 
more effective than others,' Boilard 
said "But there are so many mov-

ing parts to these programs. and it 
seems to me reasonable that there 
can be many improvements to these 
programs. Unfortunately, it's been an 
all or nothing approach when it comes 
to funding." 

Critics have panned the univer-
sity for nOl establishing a direct link 
between academic success and out-
reach programs. 

However, some politicians say 
that outreach is an essential tool 
for retention and recruitment of a 
diverse student body. State Sen. Jackie 
Speier (D-San FranciscofSan Maleo), 
who sits on the Senate Education 
Committee, lauded outreach e.fforts 
such as the Preuss School, UCSD's 
charter school that enroUs disadvan-
taged students. 

"This is a school where disadvan-
taged high school students graduate 
at a me of9O percent and the major-
ity of them go on to a UC school," 
Speier said "That's a phenomenal 
story that should be heralded, not 
criticized." 

SchWil/7.alegger's budget revision 
also reduced the university's budget 
by 53.8 million because of augmented 
related enroUment levels.

Norton's Comeback Fizzles With This Sleepy Tale of Statutory Romance

Valley Girl: Edward Norton slars as midi:J.le-agfd d,ylfr who romance.! a teen (Evan Raehl-
Wood) in "Down in the Valley." 1lris performance maries Norlon"[lJ'Ot lead role in three yea". 

By Ri/ey Sa/ani-Pearce 
SENtOR STAFF WRITER 

It's understandable that many mms have attempted to capture the essence 0 f the San Fernan do 
Valley on the big screen; after 
all, that's where most of them are 
made. lnevitably. though, tlle val-
ley tends to get glorified or vilified. 
By clinging to the splinters of wil-
derness that usually go unnoticed 
above the snarl s of freeway traffic , 
director David Jacobson crafts a 
much more grounded interpreta-
tion of Los Angeles' rnega-burb to 
the north in "Down in the Valley; a 
nco-Western take on a classic story 
of forbidden love. Unfortunately 
for all those involved, Jacobson 
doesn't find many redeeming qual-
ities in the Valley, or in the leaden 
characters who occupy it. 

In his first major role in three 
years, Edward Norton takes the 

.reigns as Harlan, a dull , misplaced 
cowboy who pumps gas for a liv-
ing and claims he's never seen the 
ocean. It's crucial to the plot that 
he come off as charming, except 
he really just seems a little slow. 
He's also supposed to be hand-
some, but Edward Norton's droopy, 
slouching, sun -beaten act makes 
him seem shrewish and older than 
he really is. When a young girl 
flirtatiously grabs lIarian's stringy 
bicep as he pumps her gas, she 
remarks "he's real, all right" - and 
you can alma t see her imagining 
Matthew M Conaughey. 

None of this adds any much-
needed bel ievabiii ty to I I arl an's 
intense romance with Tobe (Evan 
Rachel -Wood), an equally bor-
ing. "rebeUious" girl half his age 
who spots him at a gas station and 
decides it's lime he saw the beach. 
We don't learn much else about 
her, besides that "Tobe" is short. for 

October and that she has a pen -
chant for fucking middle-aged cow-
boys on the first date. Along for the 
ride is David Morse in yet another 
requisite poLice role, this lime as a 
sheriff and concerned father. Morse 
tries hard but fail~ to add depth to 
his paper-flat character. A fattened-
up Rory Culkin (the youngest one) 
shows promise as 'lobe's brother 
Lonnie, a kid so painfully boring 
that we take pity on him , caring 
more and more about him through 
tlle film, if only because we care less 
and less about everyone else.

By Simone Wilson 
S[ lOR STArr WRIl [R 

Stepping away from the silent, stunning images of daily life in Iraq and Afghanistan that conclude the current exhibit at the 
Museum of Photographic Art (MoPA), I 
depressingly re-encounter the manicured trop-
ics and faux-Spanish fountains that inhabit 
Balboa Park Resentment of San Diego's palm-
scattered cement takes on new life after having 
tnlth breathed back into me by the six pioneer-
ing women in photojournalism. and two more 
that carryon their legacy today. 

The black-and-white prints of Therese 
Bonney, Esther Bubley, Olga Lander, Hansel 
Meith, Grace Robertson and Margaret Bourke-
White (the only Significantly famous one in 
the bunch) Ilesh nut a human history of war, 
depression and living conditions during the 
mid-1900s: European art ravaged by the feroc-
ity of World War II. An African-American 
breadline silhouetted by a billboard advertis-
ing the white, top-dawn -convertible American 
Dream. Tribally clothed African nat ives sign ing 
up to work in the gold mines. Soviet soldiers 
removing the swastika from their train. The 
topics range Widely, yet join seamlessly to illus-
trate the complexity of an era. 

But why restrict this social commentary 
to the work of women? The answer unfolds 
through the maze of gallery walls, dotted with 
images of everyday life to accompany the pro-
found Female factory workers gleam with pride 

under their hard hats, and a homeless man 
sleeps peacefully by a campfire with his skeletal 
dog. In the Life magazine spread "Mother's Day 
orr:' Robertson observes a group or middle-
aged London women finally lett ing loose, hik-
ing up their skirts and throwing back a few. 
By getting close to scenes that men have been 
Jess known to photograph - perhap it would ' 
have been more difficult for them - these 
women prove the worth of femininity in the 
profession. 

Not to say that male photographers cannot 
capture emotion, but there is a certain aspect 
of these subjects tIlat suggest they were able 
to open up more freely with a feminine eye 
behind the lens. This truth is reinforced by the 
last room of the exhibit, displaying in radiant 
color the modern masterpieces of Stephanie 
Sinclair and Andrea Bruce. Afghan women let 
the photographers in to witness the burned, 
dying corpses of their sister spousal abuse vic-
tims, and at the same time, American women 
are not seen as huge threats to the men . 

What these women seem to understand is 
that not every photo needs a mangled soldier 
to evoke pain or sympathy - in fact, Bruce's 
simple shot of a child and old woman praying 
in poverty prompted an anonymous viewer to 
donate 55,000 to the family. 

The startling closeness of a land we 
Americans so distance ourselves from is refresh-
ing, a beauty that transcends the Southern 
California tackiness and leaves us just a Little 
elevated.

10 HIATUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Aussie Pair Take On the Empire With Six-Shooters 
~ PROPOSITION, from page B 
t he inside of a shed Light razors into 
t he dark from cracks and bulJetholes 
while voices outside shout the famil -
iar "Oil We've got you surrounded!" 
spiel. Soon, someone is gut shot. 
dnd a pair of whores are s reaming 
for mercy just before someone else 
slumps over, gun half-drawn , most 
of his face left on the Ooor adjacent. 
This is tJ1e way of the Western - a 
quiet peace made tense by Ihe threat 
of absolute violence at any moment. 

This template makes "Thc 
Proposition' the perfect vehicle for 
both director Ilil lcoat and writer 
Nic k Cave (both nat ive Australians): 
J-l iJlcoat is known fo r his awa rd-win-
ning music videos and Cave fo r hi 
narrative piano bal lads. often full of 
violent imagery an d murderous des-
peration. The sccnes of violcnce play 
as Illusic videos - short . memorablc 
and immaculately shot - bUI wilh 
Ihe charmingly twisled mind of Cave 
providing the detailed. bloody narra-
t (ves instead of his music. The prob-
lem (wmlll on to music video direc-
lors) is that the rest of the movic is 

oddly pa cd. often moving too sl owly 
without building ten sion in the stylc 
of Western greats I ikc Peckinpah and 
Leone. 

The mm is often dist racted from 
its inl ended proposit ion. however, 
when it attempts to show the variet-
ies of the Aust ral ian experience: not 
just the lIies, but the cvil . wcU -man-
nered colonial governors. the freshly 
used cat o' nine lails soaked lhrough 
with bl ood, the frightening aborigi-
nals and the lawmen that massacre 
them - it's all too much for Captain 
Stanley to civilize. Stanley's propo-
sition may be the reason the film 
co ntinues al ong. but the slices of 
bush ranger Australian life arc easily 
the most inl cresting moments in the 
111 m. 

II seems evcrything in Aust ralia 
is a battle, and each on(' is touched 
upon, if only for a moment. whether 
it be Ihe conflict between tlle empire 
and the colony, confli t between the 
blacks and whites, or between the 
different group of whi tes ("What 
is an Irishman but a nigger turned 
inside Ollt?" says British bounty hunt-

er lellon Lamb, played by all always 
scene-stealing John Hurt). There's 
even the Conradesque battle between 
civili2ation and madness, played out 
by Huston's magnetic Arthur, who 
recites British poetry and ruminates 
on the landscape before descen ding 
into the settlements to rape women 
and tomp them to death. And of 
course, the plot requires fratricide, a 
quest unthinkable in any land besides 
that of uncivilized Australia. 

Though the acting is consistently 
briUiant, the godforsaken landscape 
steals the show throughout the length 
of the ftlm. The outback is so real 
and so dangerous that it provides 
the perfe<:t setting for the battles of 
humanity waged by each character. 
lust as the Western gets to the core of 
American manhood - being forced 
10 do right in a hostile environment , 
no maller the cost - the interior 
of Australia ups the ante. Ilere, it's 
hard enough to fight to survive, but 
in order to civilize such a hell, a man 
can'l simply stop at survival. II makes 
for a Western experience as raw and 
as real as the anything in the genre. 

Muddled 'Valley' Fails to Freshen Up the Western 
~ VALLEY, fro fn page 8 

The fiI m's fi rsl act is pushed 
along by the valley itself. namely thc 
sweeping cinematography and con-
templative still shots; Jacobson keeps 
Ilarian and Tobe small by co nstantly 
~on trast i ng their tiny existence wilh 
Ihe valley's vasl suburban-industri-
al smogscapes. Fo r a while, aU thi 
Western izing distracts nicely from 
Ihe story, but when thc plot kicks 
into high gear. the story's many holes 
gape into view (why, fo r example, is 
Tobes dad only a I ittle miffed about 
his leen daughter's 40-year-old boy-
fr iend?) The majo r plot twist, awk-
wardly placed hal fway through the 

fil m, breaks convention by actually 
maki ng the protagonist Ie s interest-
ing. Things only go downhill from 
there, and as thc movie devolves into 
a string of chases and shootouts, 
viewers are left_scratching thei r heads 
and wondering who to root for. 

Ja obson draws his heavy-ha nd-
ed themal ic issues using a string of 
cliches from various movie genres: 
Harl an sits alone trying to stuff a 
donut hole back into the do nut ; 
Harlan asks Tobe ifshe thinks "things 
have a purpose;" Harlan gets int o a 
shootout on an old West movie set. 
Lest you forget the fUm's constant 
old-West-meets-new-West theme, 

the clim ax takes place in a hal f-built 
new suburban track home - with a 
horse in the garage. 

Though clo king barely more 
than two bours. "Down in the Valley" 
seems so painfully long that it 's hard 
not to lose intere ·\. As the co nstant 
foreshadowing promises, before the 
film ends, ashcs will be scattered. r 
won't give away whose ashes, though 
any ending is a happy one if your 
only goal is escaping the theater. 

"Down in the Valley" is long. 
hazy and boring, despite plenty of 
sex and violence. In other words, 
Jacobson has captured the San 
Fernando Valley perfectly.

**** Though it may sound \ike it was ripped right front the motherboard o( a spacefaring Artoo unit, the Aanting Lips aren't singing about robots this time. In fact, despite 
the farty synth squow and sometimes spare, mechanical 
mythms, At War With the Mystic.~ is unswervingly human.

they do, with absolute humanity, fmding a rosy understand-
ing of the world both enviable and addictive. 

When singer Wayne Coyne Wks about BWih, he wonders 
if he or anyone else would do the same thing in sucb a posi-
tion. (n the machinelike "free Radicals," Coyne imagines 
that neo-hippie Devendra Banhart is dissuading a suicide 
bomber from that path. Other songs are bittersweet poetry: 
about Gwen Stefani imagining her place in the univ.:rse, a 
gid made sad by the emptiness of her pop music (yes. that 
means you) and Coyne's heart-wrenching last days with his 
dying mother. Somehow, wondering about the Gwens and

The Lashes do not, despite their album's title, "get it." They thought they had all the l)ieces of the puzzle to a hip indie band - trendy hilircuts, thrift store clothes 
and that crucial band name (you know, the one that starts 
with a "the: followed by some clever noun or verb). But 
all the hard work they put into squeezing into those jeans 
would have been better spent on the music. 

The 12-track record, coming in just shy of 30 min-
utes, fllld s the Seattl c group meandering through dull 
melodies. the same goddamn guitar chords, and lyrics that 
could have been written by a 9-year-old ("So metimes the

is overtly refmed heavy guitars and lingering pop melodies 
Ihat would make any Coldplay fan do a double take. Too bad 
lead vocalist Gary Lightbody doesn't have Martin's bad hair 
and worse teeth. 

Eyes Open isn't a bad album by any means. Snow Patrol's 
smooth, sentimental lyrics arc still thankfully intact. as 

Dubyas in aU of us fllS the Lips' humanistic worldview per-
fectly, and makes for a beautiful listen. 

The music by itself is hard to take for those used to the 
last few Lips albums, with off-key falsettos and loud, fuzzed -
out guitars battling stereophonic synthesizers and Bonzo-
in-a-box drumming. There are st.ilJ the soft synth lines of 
Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots on the slower songs. but here 
theyevo(ve into stadium-worthy hard rock. The lone instru-
mental rThe Wtzard Turns On His Giant Silver Aashlight 
And Put On His We~olf Moccasins") is another slice of 
weird spaceship-landing perfection; like an aural Rorschach 
test, it's the soundtrack to your own personal movie. 

The point? This is a rock record. and if Black Sabbath 
isn't in your coUection, you might want to sit this round 
out. 

The Flaming Lips will perform on May 24 at SDSU Open 
Air Theatre.

if he knows he's just going through the motions. 
In trying to appeal to the same fan base responsible 

for FallOut Boy's radio ubiquity, the Lashes still don't 
quite get it: Their drummer sounds excruciatingly bored 
and grossly underused; the teenage angst to go al ong with 
the whiny lyrics is nonexistent; and the tracks aren't even 
danceable, the one redeeming quality that might have 
saved them from fading into hipster oblivion. 

Most likely, tile Lashes were picked up by Columbia 
because they're unthreatcnin g to any demographic - that 
is, except to those people that enjoy interesting music.

evident in "I lands Open' and "You're All I I lave." In "Set 
Fire to the Third Bar." Lightbody's melodic tone weaves with 
Manha Wainwright's ghostly fragile voice. making for an 
eerie, hypnotic and audibly engaging duel. 

But as the album progJ'CSS(.'S, you start to feel as if the 
song are repeating themselves, with only the fast rocking or 
soft reflective melody to set them apart . Angsty romance? 
We get it. Bar on frre? We get that too. now Patrol may 
have some great potential singles on the album, but by the 
time the end of tile record rolls around, it 's hard for anyone 
to keep their eyes open.

Born in Fontana and raised in Bostonia. CA. Davis is a former meat-cutter and 
truck driver who teaches history at the University of California. Irvine. He is a 
MacArthur fellow and long-time activist whose earliest political activities date 
back to the late 1960s. His highly original analyses of the labor movement, 
Latino urban space. and the aftermath of Katrina have set the standard for 
progressive teaching and scholarship. In the context of the recent 
mobilizations around the issue of immigrants' rights, Davis' reflections on the 
history of vigilante violence in California could not be more relevant. 

Lecture Is free and open to the public.

Women Play Crucial Role 
In Capturing CCAA Cup 
~ cup, trom page 16 
their best season as a 0-11 team. 

The women's soccer team had 
similar success, edging Cal State 
Dominguez Hills in a 4-3 champion-
ship victory in early November. WIlh 
the championship win - their fifth 
in six years - the Tritons advam:ed to 
the NCAA Far West Regional tourna-
ment, where they once again downed 
Cal Slate Dominguez Hills to reach the 
ftnals facing Seattle Pacific University. 
Ahhough they feU in the title match, 
the Tritons' efforts did not go with-
out notice, as junior CCAA Player of 
the Year Megan Dickey, junior KeUy 
Cochran and senior Heather Szafraniec 
were all named to the NCAA AU-Far 
West Region Second Team. 

Senior Briana Hinga offered one 
of the most impressive contributions 
in capturing the Com missioner's Cup, 
playing on both the steUar basketball 
and track and field squads. As a for-
ward on the basketball team, Hinga 
was a defensive stalwan, playing all 
but one game and staning 20 out of 
27 of those bouts. While averaging 
the fourth-most minutes per game 
with 25.4, she led the ieam with 52 
blocks and was second on the team 
with 7.4 rebounds per game. This 
effort helped the team earn a berth 
to the NCAA Division-II Women's 
Basketball National Tournament, 
where the Tritons ultimately lost a 

close battle to Seattle Pacific in the 
fmtround 

As a member of the track -and 
field team, Hinga showed her skills 
at the CCAA Championships earlier 
this month, placing fourth overall 
in the high jump and ftnt in the 
javelin throw. Her javelin perfor-
mance secured her the No. 1 national 
ranking at the NCAA D-II National 
Championships, which will com-
mence on May 25 in Emporia, Kan. 

Hinga, whose hard work will 
surely be missed by her teams, was 
proud to playa part in bringing the 
Commissioner's Cup to UCSD. 

"It's been a great honor to be 
pan of two amazing teams," she said 
"It's exciting that UCSD athletics has 
earned this honor not only for the 
athletes oot also the school." 

UCSD should remain optimistic 
of its chances for winning next year's 
Cup, as aU of its squads will remain 
strong and determined In addition 
to the expectations that the women 
will continue their successful ways, 
the men wiU undoubtedly do their 
pari. as the baseball, track and field 
and tennis teams arc all playing with 
fervor. Only time will teU if these loft y 
expectations can be realized, but it is 
certain that the UCSQ athletic pro-
gram shows much promise in fight-
ing for its second consecutive CCAA 
Commissioner's Cup. 

Youthful Generation of 
Tritons to Lead New Era

keeping them grounded through the 
long series. They had the talent, so I 
didn't have to help them with their 
game at all" 

Decker and Durket were first and 
second, respectively, on the Tritons in 
ERA. Decker appeared in 23 games, 
starting eight, and went 7-6 with a 
3.69 ERA and 38 strikeouts compared 
to only eight walks. Durket appeared 
in fewer games than Decker, but was 
still effed ive in his \0 appearances. He 
only pitched 26.1 innings. but his 3.76 
ERA is a sign that he will be reliable 
as a starter or a reliever next year, just 
Like Decker. 

"He's obviously good enough to 
be a starter," O'Brien said "But a lot 

. of {imes you want to put your most 

resilient arms in the bullpen. And 
Trevor is exactly that. We'll make our 
decision based on the best interest of 
the team." 

Whatever O'Brien decides to do 
with his pitchers next year, the staff 
should be as good or better compared 
to this year, when the leam's ERA 
was 5.22, versus \be 5.66 of UCSD's 
opponents. 

O'Brien is excited for the opportu-
nity to bri.ng next year's leanl on the 
field and have the chance to see how 
his freshmen players have developed 
during the offseason. And if Cantele 
and Decker are just the first of many 
talented freshmen to come through the 
UCSD baseball program, then O'Brien 
can expect more pleasant surprises 
next year.

TRITON TEAMS 
BRING HONOR 

TOUCSD 
WITH TROPHY 

Athletes take first-
annual CCAA 
Commissioner's Cup 
in a year of dominant 
athletic performances. 

By Danai Leininger 
A SSOCIAIL SPORT EDITOR 

UCSD has earned the honor of 
being the first school to engrave its 
name on the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association Commissioner's 
Cup after an impressive year of 
exciting and successful athletic cam-
paigns. 

The notable distinction was deter-
mined by an aggregate-point system, 
which calculated each school's Cup 
ranking by adding its top two regu-
lar eason team fmishes within the 
conference in each of thc faU , winter 
and spring sea ons. In add ition to 
those six numbers, each school's two 
remaining top finishes were added to 
the total. 

The Cup' calculations also 
included individual sports, such as 
cro s country, track and field, and 
golf. Unlike the team sport tallies, the 
individual sports earned Cup points 
based on the results of each their sea-
son's postseason finishes. Although 
it's a daunting task to decipher this 
complicated fo rmula, the bottom line 
declared UCSD as the clear victor for 
the title. 

As the inaugural recipients of the 
Cor.~mi ssione r's Cup, the Tritons 
outperformed aU of their conference 
opponents to earn the highest com-
bined ranking total in eight of 13 
sports, finishing with 14.5 points. 
Chico State followed in second place 
with 21.5 points, while Cal State 
Bakersfield finished in a distant 
third with 27.5 points. The ninth 
and 10th spots went to Cal State 
San Bernardino and San Francisco 
State, which had 37.5 and 60 points, 
respectively. 

While the majority of the UCSD 
teams had productive seasons that 
cont ributed to the strength of the 
athletics program, it was the women's 
squads that ultimately carried the 
Tritons to the Commissioner's Cup. 
Five of the eight top fmishes lhat were 
factors in the total calculation for the 
Cup belonged to the women, who 
fought their way to CCAA cham-
pionship crowns in cross country, 
soccer, tennis and track and field. 
The women's basketball squad also 
contributed , notching a second place 
finish in CAA play. 

Among the numerous top-tier 
perform ances of the past year, the 
women's cross country team reached 
tile top of the CCAA with admirable 
determi.nation, clawing its way to a 
seventh place finish at the NCAA 0 -11 

Natio~a1 Championships. On its way 
to the championships, UCSD toppled 
it CCAA foe in San Francisco in late 
October, with senior CCAA Runner 
of the Year Mimi Hodgins IiteraUy 
running away with the 6-kiIome-
ter race by almost half a minute. 
Sophomores Diane Dunn and Emily 
McGregor, junior Erin O'Donnell and 
senior Nina Miller aU fmished within 
the top 10 of the same race, and they 
joined Hodgins as recipients of AlI-
CCA A honors. The Tritons fmished 
second of 21 at the NCAA D-II West 
Regional meet, which propelled them 
to the national championships and

Track and Field Wears Ruby Slippers to Finals 
Tritons send a bevy of 
talent to NCAA D-II 
Championships after 
successful tWle-up at 
Occidental College. 

By Paul Choi 
SrAfF WRITER 

After a solid performance from 
the UCSD men's and women's track 
and field teanlS at the Occidental 
Invitational earlier this month, 16 
Triton athletes qualified for the 
NCAA Division-II Chanlpion hips 
in Emporia, Kan. 

"It exceeded all expectations, 
wi th women's track fi.nishing first 
and men's track second tllis season," 
head coach Tony alerno said 

UCSD ent fewer than a quarter 
of its athletes to Occidental, but still 
posted six standout performances 
tbat earned NCAA pr09isional qual-
ifying times. 

Senior Jon Patton improved his 
personal best time in the 400-meter 
hurdles with a mark of 51.49 sec-
onds. Freshman Daniel Anderson 
had his best time all year in the 800 
at 1:52.73, an NCAA provisional 
qualifying time. Also, senior Mike 
Cunningham made a great effort in 
the 400, as his mark of 48.00 seconds 
was a provisional lime and the sec-
ond fastest in school history. 

GREG DALE/GUARD'AN 
The 16 UCSD athletes heading to the NCAA Division-n Track and Field championships in Emporia, Kan., represent/he largest group of 
Triton athletes ellf!r to compete in the even/. Many of them qualifiedfor the championships at the Oecicientallnvitaliona/ on May 13. 

The UC',sO men's 4x400 squad 
met an NCAA provisional qualify-
ing tinle with 3:13.73, and became 
the holders of a new school record 

It won its race by nearly four full 
seconds, blowing away the competi-
tion. 

On the women's side, enior 
Mimi Hodgins fmished sixth in the 
800, posting an NCAA provisional 
qualifying time of2: 11.98. The 4x400 
relay team also had success, winning 
its race with a time of 3:49.03. 

"They feel real good, the women 
competed reaUy well; said Salerno. 
"They are confident as they have 
ever been." 

The Tritons could use the confi-
dence heading into the 0 -11 cham-
pionships, which will include 16 
Tritons. 

Approximately 620 student-ath-
letes qualified for the champion-
ships by reaching the automatic and 
provisional standards for each event, 
meaning the 16 UCSD athletes will 
have plenty of competition. The 
Tritons will participate in four of 
the men's events and nine on the 
women's side. 

"The average number of athletes 
in the 0 -11 championship is about 
two per school, so we'll have one of 
the bigger groups in the competi-
tion ," Salerno said. 

All four athletes participating in 
the men's events are seniors, includ-
ing Brad Lubuit, who enters with the 
16th-best mark in the nation in jav-
elin at 200 feet. Senior Carl Lostrom 
will compete for the second-straight

Freshman Phenoms Bring Baseball Surprise Season 
Departure of seniors 
did not deter a young 
Triton baseball squad 
from p~sting solid 
numbers all year. 

By Rae! En/un 
SPORTS EDITO R 

After losing 11 ofits top seniors fol-
lowing the 2005 California Collegiate 
Athletic Association title game, 
the UCSD basebaU team seemed 
poised for a disappointing season in 
2006. Losing key players like Keith 
Hernandez and Shlomo Lipetz made 
a repeat visit to the CCAA champi-
onship unlikely. Though the Tritons 
couldn't repeat their Litle this year, as 
UCSD lost in the second round of 
the CeAA tournament to Cal State 
Dominguez Hills, the development of 

players Like junior David Morehead 
and sophomore Scott Clement cou-
pled with the addition of some spec-
tacular freshmen made the UCSD 
baseball team into a formidable force 
this year. 

When Cal State Dominguez Hills 
secured the 11 -9 victory to advance 
to the CCAA title game, the Tritons 
ended their season with an overaU 
record of 35-24, a solid fmish consid-
ering the ehaUenge head coach Dan 
O'Brien faced in molding a dedicated 
team out of a couple of skilled vet-
erans and a group of inexperienced 
youngsters. 

"I think the success of our fresh-
man class has a lot to do with our 
senior leadership this year," O'Brien 
said. "The assistant coaches did a 
good job of teaching the game the way 
we like it to be played to our freshmen 
and letting Ollr freshmen watch our 
seniors do it the way they've been

doing it for years. oft was a great com-
bination." 

One of the veterans O'Brien was 
able to rely on was Morehead (catch-
er), who batted .280 with 12 home 
runs and 41 RBIs. Morehead also 
led the team in doubles, with 19, and 
added 13 steals on the basepalhs. 

Sophomore Scott Clement, though 
only in his second year with the club, 
was another experienced hitter put in 
the middle of the Triton lineup, and 
he made the most of his opportuni-
ties, batting .349 and leading the team 
in home runs and RBIs, with 15 and 
56, respectively. 

While the likes of Clement, 
Morehead and senior outftelder David 
Gomez provided veteran leadership in 
the lineup, O'Brien was filling out 
rosters in the beginning of the season 
with players no one had beard o( 
People like CCAA Freshman of the 
Year Garrett Imeson and freshman 
Matt Cantele were suddenly thrown 

. on the field in tile hopes that they 
could replace the loss of stars like 
Hernandez and Brad Beltz. Not only 
did Imeson and Cantele make people 
forget about last season's losses, but 
they became household names and 
will be staples in UCSD's lineup for 
years to come. 

"Those two guys were invalu-
able to our success and to our team~ 
O'Brien said "Wrt.bout those two, and 
a lot of other freshmen, we don't have 
the kind of year that we did" 

Imeson, a second baseman from 
Stockton, Calif., played in all 59 games 
this season, tied for most on the team 
and led the team in batting average, 
going 74-for-203 for a .365 stat He 
also tallied five triples, drove in 35 
runs and swiped 12 bases. According 
to teammates, he was the all-around 
player the Tritons needed to make it 
as far as they did this year. 

" [Imesonl doesn't give away at-
bits,' O'Brien said ·As a freshman, I 
thought he was one of oUr offensive 
leaders and he sho-t everyone else, 
regardless of where he ~ hitting 
in the count, thlt be just fiat out 

competes and he had a lot of success 
because of that." 

While Imeson provided the Tritons 
with speed and on-base security at 
the top of the order, another fresh-
man, Cantele, carried a surprisingly 
big bat for a fI.rst-yearcollegiate player. 
Cantele came from a promising base-
ball high school in Saint Francis in 
Los Altos Hills, Calif., and his natural 
talent was evident since the beginning 
of the season, when he was banging 
deep fly balls over the right field fence 
at Triton Baseball Stadium. 

After the initial surprise of wit-
nessing such a young player dominate 
formidable CCAA pitching, Cantele's 
borne runs became standard, as he hit 
a walk-off home run, a couple of go-
ahead homers and some game-tying 
dingers. By season's end, Cantele had 
tallied 14 long balls, second on the 
team only to aement. He also led the 
team in slugging percentage with an 
impressive mark of .683, batted .289 
a.lld drove in 35 runs. 

"I'm most proud of how coach-
able Matt Cantele was; O'Brien said. 
"From the very beginning when be 
got here, he has taken everything 
we've given him and applied it to his 
game. And I think his willingness to 
listen and to be coachable was key to 
h is success." 

It took more than power for the 
Tritons to make the playoffs, and just 
like the combination of young and old 
players on offense proved successful, 
UCSD's pitching staff was anchored 
by veteran pitchers like sen ior T. C. 
Geach, and inexperienced but tal -
ented freshmen like Trevor Decker 
and Jon Durket 

"It was reilly surprising to see the 
freshmen step up and take over really 
big roles, especially the starting roles,· 
Geach said -It's a long season and 
it's difficult to go from a high school 
season to a coUege season and play 
four games in a weekend So, basically 
the seniors just kept them focWJed
