THE KISS AT CITY HALL

COURTESY OF URVASHI NAGRANI
Hundreds of students from across the University of California traveled to San Francisco last week to rally for the repeal of 
Proposition 8, a measure that prohibits same-sex marriage in California. Organized in part by UC Santa Barbara senior Urvashi 
Nagrani, the rally drew more than 1,500 demonstrators to Civic Center Plaza to watch a four-hour California Supreme Court 
debate over the constitutionality of the measure, screened on a giant television above the crowd.

It’s 10th week and us college kids are more beat than a Koala girl’s face. Whether you’ll pass that 
bio class, your pit-stained T.A. only 
knows. But I can guarantee one thing 
during this quarter’s painful home 
stretch: You will drink caffeine. Not 
because you want to, but because your 
finals week existence depends on it.

Thirsty readers beware: consum-
ing the sacred juice isn’t intuitive. 
We’ve all gulped-down one too many 
Monsters pre-midterm only to crash 
after the second question. Your choice 
in beverage is absolutely imperative to 
your studying success. So, here goes 
my personal guide to caffeine.

Tea: Lots of people diss tea 
because they think it’s a pussy 

drink. But that’s probably because 
they’re drinking Sleepytime. Fact 
is black-leaf varieties offer a light, 
calming buzz. Even if they’re too 
weak to power productivity, they 
keep you lasting through late-night 
pillowtalk. Plus, there’s something 
about seeping a bag of grassy shit in 
hot water that just makes you feel all 
natural ’n’ stuff. 

Soda: Who can say no to those 
sassy carbon-dioxide bubbles ris-
ing to your Coke’s surface? Not me. 
But if you think this sugary drink 
is going to get you past a 15 minute 
giggly period, think again. For the 
caffeine-saturated college student, 
pop is nothing more than a sugary 
distraction and should not be used in 
serious energy emergencies.

Coffee: I’ve never fully connect-
ed with the grain, but its still an 
undoubtably reliable day drink.  One 
or two cups will gradually improve 
your mood and raise your energy 
level, but the third or fourth usu-
ally renders mild anxiety and sweaty 
palms. And there’s a catch-22 for 
all those Frappuccino drinkers who 
can’t go straight black: Too much 
milk and sugar ultimately make you 
feel bloated and sluggish — exactly 
what you don’t want interfering with 
morning-to-night stamina.

Energy drinks: When you have to 
bulldoze through a 12 pager and don’t 
see that thesis on gender normatives 
happening without raised spirits and 
lighter eyelids, skip the nature-based 
substances and go for the greenish-
brown manufactured stuff. Call me 
an addict, but often my day’s high-
light is pounding a Red Bull, sitting 
back and feeling the glucuronolaca-
tone run through my veins. Suddenly 
those 20 pages of reading don’t seem 
so ambitious and your night-owl 
instinct takes over.

Miscellaneous: I don’t recom-
mend mixing beverages, but when in 
doubt, be creative. The bold caffeine-
consumer integrates their favorites 
fixes into other traditional combos. 
Why not replace milk with Monster 
in tomorrow’s cereal bowl? Or mix 
some caffeine pills into your daily 
vitamin bottle for a little surprise? 
Who knows, you might even learn to 
love the look of your Cheerios float-
ing in a fizzling green substance.

Now that I’ve shared my exper-
tise, take shameless advantage of your 
sleep-deprived self and go get jittery.

In Effort to Stop Cheating, Process Cheats Students
By Michelle Chin
Contributing Writer

STUDENT LIFE — Academic mis-
conduct at UCSD isn’t taken lightly 
— in fact, it’s handled so sloppily 
that misallegations are common-
place. 

Vague academic misconduct 
policies jeopardize students’ rights. 
In 2007-08, allegations of academic 
misconduct increased by 30 percent, 
but this was accompanied by a surge 
of students claiming they were false-
ly accused and seeking help from 
the A.S. Office of Student Advocacy.

Of the estimated 200 students 
who the office worked with last 
year,  only 46 actually went to trial 
— despite the fact that in 60 percent 
of those 200 cases, the university 
had insufficient evidence to sup-
port their accusations, according to 
Frank Carroll, assistant vice presi-
dent of Student Advocacy. What’s 
more, of those 46 students who went 
to trial, only nine were cleared of 
accusations. 

In a recent case, for example, a 
student athlete left town for a com-
petition when an assignment was 
due. The student e-mailed in the 
assignment,  but the message failed 
to send, prompting the instructor 
to report academic misconduct. 
The instructor asserted that the stu-
dent tried to improve their grade 
by lying. Despite considerable evi-
dence to the contrary, the student 
was found guilty of academic mis-
conduct. An appeal to the Council 
of Provosts was denied, and now the 
case will be presented to Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox.

 Clearly students aren’t properly 
protected by the existing policy.

Under the Student Conduct 
Code, last revised in August 2008, 
if an instructor believes there is 
evidence of academic misconduct, 
the violation is brought to the 
Academic Integrity Office. The stu-
dent may accept the charge, or deny 
it and request a formal hearing. 
At the hearing, a majority vote of 
the Academic Dishonesty Hearing 
Board (consisting of three faculty 
members, one graduate student and 

one upper-division undergraduate) 
determines the student’s academic 
integrity. 

Unlike criminal proceedings in 
a U.S. court of law, the prosecu-
tion doesn’t have to prove beyond a 
reasonable doubt that the defendant 
is guilty. It must only prove the stu-
dent’s guilt with evidence that “has 
the greater weight” and “is more 
convincing as to its truth when 
weighed against opposing evidence.”

If three out of five board mem-
bers are more than 50 percent con-
vinced the student is guilty, he or 
she is held responsible, according to 
Student Legal Services.

“[There is] definitely no algo-
rithm and at the end you just 
have to make a judgment,” said 
Jonathan Cohen, associate profes-
sor and director of graduate stud-
ies in philosophy and an alternate 
board member on the Academic 
Dishonesty Hearing Board.

With such subjective criteria, we 
lack a definitive standard by which 
guilt is judged and the decision is 
left entirely to the board’s discre-
tion.

Those charged face a tarnished 
academic career. In addition to pos-
sibly failing the course, an academic 
integrity violation is seared into a 
student’s transcript, narrowing his 
or her chances of graduate-school 
acceptance and professional success. 
Discipline may even include univer-
sity expulsion.

Because a guilty verdict can be 
so damaging to a student’s future, 
convictions must be dealt only 
when there is irrefutable evidence. 
Otherwise, innocent students may 
be wrongly charged.

The UCSD Policy on Integrity 
of Scholarship states that students 
shouldn’t try to receive a grade “by 
means other than honest effort.” 
Though copying a classmate’s exam 
clearly constitutes a dishonest effort, 
other offenses are not as clearly 
defined. The broad definition 
enables faculty to consider anything 
cheating, Carroll said.

And much of the policy is left 
similarly open, leaving students 
unprotected. For example, the 

academic integrity coordinator is 
required to provide the student 
adequate time to evaluate evidence 
before a hearing, but Carroll said 
his office has received evidence as 
little as 30 minutes prior. When a 
student’s academic future is at stake, 
30 minutes is hardly adequate.

The policy must be revised 
with objectivity in mind, including 
guidelines for legitimate evidence. 
In the student athlete’s case, an 
e-mail should be suitable evidence; 
the absence of an e-mail should not. 

By making the process more 
standardized and the rules more 
specific, the board can better regu-
late academic integrity and innocent 
students will be protected.

According to Carroll, the 

amended Policy of Integrity of 
Scholarship, which outlines hear-
ing procedures, has has been in use 
since last quarter. However, it hasn’t 
been approved by the Committee of 
Educational Policies and Courses, 
the body responsible for reviewing 
any proposed amendments to the 
undergraduate academic plan.

Tricia Bertram Gallant, the aca-
demic integrity coordinator, and 
Charles Perrin, member of the 
Committee on Educational Policies 
and Courses, deny Carroll’s claims. 
But Gallant and Cohen said minor 
changes have been implemented to 
make hearings less legalistic.

STUDENT LIFE — Nicotine-addicted 
campus misanthropes can breathe a 
collective sigh of relief. Their God-
given right to light up at school won’t 
be compromised by air-purification 
efforts anytime soon. 

Despite Chancellor Marye Anne 
Fox’s electronic notice last Wednesday 
that the university is considering a 
policy revision requiring smokers to 
remain 25 feet away from buildings 
before lighting up (the current policy 
requires — gasp! — five fewer feet), 
the adjustment doesn’t call for enforce-
ment changes.

The proposal’s purpose is to force 
us to comply with the minimum stan-
dard for Leadership in Energy and 
Environmental Design qualification. 
Basically, we’d just be changing the lan-
guage of our policy to become L.E.E.D. 
eligible. 

L.E.E.D. certification makes us 
more environmentally sustainable, 
something we evidently pride our-
selves greatly on here at UCSD, given 
the endless press releases touting our 
national recognition for this very 
accomplishment.

The significance of the L.E.E.D. 
smoking qualification lies in its ame-
liorative effects on air quality. The air 

on L.E.E.D.-certified campuses is, in 
theory, superior to that of others, as 
the 25-foot rule is supposed to ensure 
the absence of secondhand smoke in 
learning areas.

But if (read: when) the policy 
comes into effect, don’t expect to see 
bloodthirsty RSOs milling about the 
resident halls with new, five-foot-lon-
ger tape measures to assess the crimes 
of assumed perpetrators. Don’t expect 
to see campus police issuing fines to 
those who make the fatal error of 
whipping out their Camels a mere 24 
feet in front of Geisel.

Don’t expect to see anything at all. 
That’s the beauty of this new policy: 
its modifications are so insignificant, 
and they won’t change a thing. The 
only change to the current policy is 
the replacement of the digits “20” 
with “25.”

Meanwhile, the policy’s laughably 
brief enforcement clause states that 
“the success of this policy depends 
upon the thoughtfulness, consider-
ation and cooperation of everyone.” 
It sets no guidelines, suggesting only 
that chain-smokers please be thought-
ful.

 Pressing the backspace key twice 
and typing “25” doesn’t signify greater 
sustainability efforts. It signifies an 
eagerness to manipulate policy so we 
can one day boast that all of our 

buildings are certified green. If our 
university possessed an unwavering 
commitment to environmental sus-
tainability, we wouldn’t be rewording a 
vague, five-year-old policy on smoking 
to meet minimum requirements. We’d 
be assessing the impact of more active 
changes, like making UCSD entirely 
smoke free.

Though radical and, in some eyes, 
unattainable, the prospect of a smoke-
free campus may be possible. In the 
San Diego area alone, Mesa College, 
Grossmont College, Cuyamaca College 
and Point Loma Nazarene University 
have all banned cancer sticks.

According to Stacie Spector, associ-
ate vice chancellor of university com-
munication and public affairs, “for any 
further restrictions on smoking to be 
considered, a discussion among fac-
ulty, staff and students and a written 
proposal that could be vetted campus-
wide would have to occur.”

If we were more interested in mak-
ing UCSD sustainable than in public 
recognition, we wouldn’t be resting on 
our laurels. 

Smoking causes the release of tox-
ins into the atmosphere and promotes 
littering through the dispersal of ciga-
rette butts — both of which clearly 
compromise sustainability. Yet the pro-
posal doesn’t address these concerns. 
It sacrifices concrete action in favor of 

hasty rewriting and shows no concern 
for campus air quality — exactly the 
opposite of what the L.E.E.D. qualifica-
tion is designed to do. 

Were the U.S. Green Building 
Council — the organization respon-
sible for determining L.E.E.D. certifi-
cation — to question our new smok-
ing policy before checking off that 
precious qualification, how, really, 
could we defend it? By saying our 
policy trusts “everyone” to be respon-
sible without providing any means of 
enforcement? How very convincing. 

Maggie Souder, campus sustain-
ability coordinator, said she’s confi-
dent smokers will be cognizant of the 
changes, and attributes most defiance 
of the policy to the ignorance of its 
perpetrators. Which is sweet. And 
optimistic. And unrealistic. 

Anyone who has ever strolled down 
I-Walk on a Friday night knows that 
with the current policy, there’s no stop-
ping the ennui-afflicted Frenchman 
from lighting up right outside his door. 
In order to really address air qual-
ity concerns, we need to do more 
than edit another bureaucratic sheet of 
paper. We must look into visibly reduc-
ing our impact — or we don’t deserve 
that precious green certification.

most current policy to help the 
Office of Student Advocacy bet-
ter protect students it represents. 
But this request was denied because 
of the Committee on Educational 
Policies and Courses’ closed status. 

Perrin said the committee is not 
required to make the policy pub-
lic while it is in development. But 
closed committees and undisclosed 
procedural changes foster even 
greater confusion for those accused, 
and such secrecy leads to unjust 
rulings.

While the Office of Student 
Advocacy and the Committee on 

Educational Policies and Courses 
agree changes must be transparent, 
the current process is not. By enact-
ing unapproved changes, devel-
oping a new policy behind closed 
doors and leaving the process open 
to subjective implementation, the 
committee is keeping critical infor-
mation from students and student 
advocates. Withholding any infor-
mation compromises the system’s 
validity. But keeping the whole 
process a secret makes protecting 
innocent students nearly impos-
sible. And such protection must be 
of paramount concern, given the 
seriousness of allegations.

To increase transparency and 
eliminate confusion, the committee 
must publicize changes as they are 
implemented and keep the Office of 
Student Advocacy up to date.

Cheating is a very serious offense 
that must be addressed, but not 
at the cost of a fair hearing. The 
policy needs to be developed with 
full transparency and must address 
the issue of ambiguity. If the pro-
cess remains as it is currently, little 
stands between an innocent student 
and a guilty verdict.

THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN By Niven Wilson !"##"$%#&%#'"%"()#&$

Dear Editor,
As the International Criminal 

Court takes a huge step toward 
resolving conflict in Darfur by releas-
ing an arrest warrant for Sudanese 
President Omar al-Bashir, the United 
States is still giving the ICC the cold 
shoulder by all practical measures. 
Not only did former President Bush 
un-sign the Rome Statute, which is 
the ICC Treaty and has been signed 
by 138 countries, but the United 
States does not even take a seat at 
the Assembly of State Parties, the 
governing body of the ICC. That 
must change.

President al-Bashir’s indictment 
signals the first time an acting head 
of state has been called to trial by 
the ICC. The message is that no one 
is above the law and leaders accused 
of genocide, war crimes and crimes 
against humanity can no longer hide 
behind sovereignty.

The United States has a history 
of standing up for human rights and 
international justice, just as we did at 
the Nuremberg Trials. That reputa-
tion has been tarnished over the past 
few years, but we can claim it once 
again by signing the Rome Statute. 
The United States can help the ICC 
catch bad guys like al-Bashir and 
assist victims in seeing justice served.

As the ICC continues to gain 
leverage and authority, a paradigm 
shift will occur in the world; no lon-
ger will the powerful be free to break 
the law as they please and no longer 
will their infractions be halted only 
by violent military force. World lead-
ers will be systematically put to trial 
for their crimes by a fair and unbi-
ased international institution — the 
International Criminal Court.

The United States should not sit 
on the sidelines as the world changes 
around it. Because we are Americans 
who value freedom and the unalien-
able rights of all people, we must 
support the only body of law that 
can uphold these rights on a global 
scale. The United States must sign 
the Rome Statute again and take a 
seat at the next Assembly of State 
Parties.

Molaison’s brain, which lacks hippocampi.

ALYSSA BEREZNAK
SENIOR STAFF WRITER

t hough Jacopo Annese appreci-ated the first-class digs on his Feb. 16 flight from Boston to San Diego, it’s doubtful that the plastic chamber next to him 
— filled with formaldehyde, cotton and the 
most studied brain in modern medicine — 
took much of a notice.

Annese, assistant professor of neurosci-
ence at UCSD and director of the university’s 
Brain Observatory, took the first step in a 
three-month project last month when he 
retrieved the brain of world-famous amnesiac 
Henry Molaison from a lab in Massachusetts, 
later to be transfered to his Sorrento Valley 
laboratory’s roomy refrigerator.

 “JetBlue was really nice,” Annese said. 
“They gave us drinks. They were very help-
ful. They made sure I had the front row for 
me and the brain.”

 He may have been traveling with a 
rather silent companion, as celebrity brains 
tend to be, but those six hours in the air 
were Annese’s most intimate moments with 
Molaison’s brain before slicing it into thou-
sands of pieces.

His plan: divide the organ into about 
3,000 paper-thin sections, mount them on 
microscopic slides, record their images and 
upload them to the observatory’s online data 
base — all in hopes of creating a gigantic 
library of brains that navigates like Google 
Earth.

However, actual blade-on-brain action 
won’t begin for another two months. In the 
meantime, Annese is prepping the observa-
tory for the procedure and seeking under-
graduates who want to help out. 

First, the observatory’s team will place 
the brain in gelatin to undergo a two-month 
protection process; afterward, the brain will 
be frozen so that it can sliced horizontally, 
from top to bottom, like a butcher would 
slice deli meat.

But who exactly is this Molaison, better 
known as H.M., and how did he become the 
brain community’s Britney? 

Molaison was injured in a bike accident 
when he was seven, and began to have minor 
seizures by age 10. At 27, Molaison was expe-
riencing up to ten seizures per week, keeping 
him from properly functioning in society. He 
was then referred to brain surgeon William 
Scoville, who removed his hippocampus — a 
sea-horse-shaped brain structure located five 
centimeters from the outside edge of the ear 
canal.

After this experimental 1953 surgery, 
Molaison retained his childhood memories, 
but couldn’t form new ones.

“That was the most dramatic thing,” 
said James Brewer, an assistant professor in 
radiology and neuroscience who conducts 
research at the Human Memory Laboratory. 
“Even things as salient as his own mother 
dying, or a man landing on the moon — he 

could not form memories for that material.” 
By studying Molaison, Canadian neuro-

psychologist Brenda Milner and her student 
assistant Suzanne Corkin discovered in 1962 
that different aspects of memory are con-
trolled by different parts of the brain.

For example, Molaison could acquire new 
motor skills without retaining any memory 
of the learning process.

“So, if you took him to play golf every day, 
every day you’d have to reintroduce yourself 
to him when you met him at his house,” 
Brewer said. “He’d say he’s never seen you 
before. Every day you’d have to re-explain 
the rules of golf to him; he wouldn’t know 
that either. But every day he’d get better and 
better at the game of golf. He’d say, ‘I’ve never 
played this before,’ and then whack — he hits 
[the ball] 300 yards.” 

Corkin, currently a professor of behav-
ioral neuroscience at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, met Annese while 
they were working at UCLA. 

Two years before Molaison’s death in 
December 2008, Corkin asked Annese if he’d 
like the amnesiac’s brain; Annese agreed, and 
took the opportunity to get to know the man 
whose brain he’d later dissect and post online 
for the world to see.

Annese was immediately aware of his 
responsibility to the medical community,

SOMETHING’S
    MISSING

Mud pies, plastic dinosaurs and finger-painted macaroni will soon be replaced by swivel chairs and 
office supplies at UCSD’s cramped yet cozy 
International Center. 

After nearly 50 years of operation, the 
International Cooperative  Nursery School 
was shut down by UCSD administrators 
on Feb. 27 due to overcrowding at the 
International Center. Located conveniently 
at the center of campus, the nursery school 
offered flexible hours — and an alternative 
curriculum that emphasized multicultural-
ism — to the young children of staff, faculty 
and students. 

The administration plans to convert the 
space previously occupied by the nursery 
school into new offices for International 
Center activity. The current need for office 
space is mainly a result of a goal set in 2008 
by the university to increase study-abroad 
rates from 22 percent of all students to 50 
percent over the next five years. 

“[They] have had office space in hall-
ways and storage rooms for several years 
while waiting for the ICNS to relocate,” 
Associate Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Edward Spriggs said in an e-mail.  

In 2006, parents protested a proposal to 
close the school halfway through their chil-
dren’s academic year. Two- to five-year-old 
kids marched up and down Library Walk 
donning T-shirts and signs reading, “Let us 
stay in school!” 

Instead, to make the transition 
smoother, administrators timed the clos-
ing of ICNS with the completion UCSD’s 
only other nursing school — the Early 
Childhood Education Center, located in 
East Mesa Housing — this February. In 
addition, ECEC responded to the desper-
ate ICNS parents by opening a part-time 
program to serve children displaced by the 
closure of the nursery school.  

Funding for the old nursery school 
came from per-child tuition and contribu-
tions from the Friends of the International 
Center, a university organization; the only 
direct financial contribution from UCSD 

was reduced rent. 
“It’s incomprehensible to me that UCSD 

would consider shutting down this school a 
rational decision, given that it doesn’t cost 
the university much,” philosophy professor 
and ICNS parent Christian Wuthrich said. 
“It’s almost free for the university.” 

ICNS Director Connie Justice said she 
had been under the impression that UCSD 
would merely relocate the nursery school 
to another on-campus location; many par-
ents had the same idea. 

“We’ve always been hoping for a 
reprieve,” said math professor Kate 
Okikiolu, whose children were enrolled at 
ICNS. “Nobody actually believed it would 
happen. I’m still in denial that it’s actually 
happening.” 

According to Spriggs, UCSD admin-
istrators allowed advocates from ICNS to 
participate in meetings, updated them on 
timelines and provided alternative options 
for parents. 

ICNS allowed students to attend two, 
three or five days a week, including week-
ends, during one of three time slots. The 
new part-time program at ECEC only 
offers morning and afternoon sessions, and 
only on weekdays. 

“Parents who were students or faculty 
could have lunch with their children [at 
the ICNS],” said Susie Yount, ICNS parent. 
“The students can take field trips around 
the university, like looking at the art pieces 
at the Craft Center or visit the university 
library. At a very young age, they know 
what a university is.” 

ICNS made a point to welcome chil-
dren from different backgrounds, and who 
spoke different languages, into its program. 
Because many parents who sought out the 
preschool were visiting scholars, spaces 
were often opened up for waitlisted chil-
dren.

“Some of our children came to us 
after being kicked out of their preschools 
because they couldn’t speak English or

T o compensate for Winter Quarter’s gift to harried ninth-week students everywhere — a 
lost hour of sleep, thanks to daylight 
saving time — the UCSD Wellness 
Center will host a post-lecture power 
nap Monday, March 9. 

The first annual UCSD Nap-In, 
an initiative of the newly launched 
LiveWell UC San Diego, comes in a 
response to a UC-wide report that 
found mental problems such as stress, 
depression and eating disorders among 
the most common health issues on 
campuses.  

“It’s kind of like wellness politi-
cal activism,” acting director of the 
Wellness Center Jerry Phelps said. 
“What we’re doing is trying to create 
a framework for a healthy learning 
environment.”

Two registration-fee increases over 
the last two years have partly gone 
toward improving student-health 
resources and hiring additional staff for 
Counseling and Psychological Services 
and Student Health.

Three percent of the total 7 per-
cent increase in 2007-08 went to fund 
Student Health programs, as did 5 per-
cent of the total 10 percent increase in 
2008-09.

The Nap-In coincides with daylight savings time, and will be 
supplemented by talks on how a quick snooze can improve stu-
dents’ mental health and classroom performance. 

According to sleep researcher and Nap-In keynote speaker 
Sara Mednick, an assistant professor of psychology at UCSD, lack 
of sleep is a major contributor to an array of common problems, 
including high blood pressure and obesity.  

In her research, Mednick runs electrocardiogram tests assess-
ing memory, vision, motor skills and creative problem-solving 
abilities in napped and non-napped subjects. She explained that 
getting enough sleep is essential for information retention and 
improved cognitive performance, but added that she understands 
why cram sessions are sometimes necessary. 

“If you’re not prepared for the test, you have the ability to retain 
the information for a certain amount of time — but if you want to 
have that information and use it and generalize it to future tests, 
sleep is essential to that,” Mednick said. 

Sonia Ancoli-Israel, professor of psychiatry at the UCSD 
School of Medicine, explained that because sleep is controlled 
partly by a decrease in body temperature, napping comes natu-
rally after lunch, as the body’s temperature falls. Since circadian 
rhythms in adolescents are delayed — often they don’t feel sleepy 
until 1 a.m. or 2 a.m., but still have to wake up early for class. 

“Most students are sleep deprived,” Ancoli-Israel said. 
“[Mednick] has shown that taking that nap actually consolidates 

an improved memory.”
Revelle College senior Maggie Profita said that 

finals often make her irritable due to sleep depriva-
tion; regardless, the all-nighter isn’t going anywhere.  

“Finals week, I don’t sleep that much at all,” Profita 
said. “When I’m super tired I don’t do as well, but I still 

stay up because I need to study. I think because I feel like 
there’s that one thing that could be on there, and if I stay up 

and study then I might get a little better [score].”

and said he had nightmares about 
potential mishaps.

“If I drop the brain on the 
floor, then I’m worried about this,” 
Annese said. “You can never predict 
it. We’ve practiced a lot; we’re very 
confident about it. There’s always a 
little bit of uncertainty.”

Despite this, the environment in 
Annese’s workplace is by no means 
tense. The lab is equipped with a 
well-endowed cappuccino maker, a 
fridge stocked with whipped cream, 
a couch for lounging and old-print 
Italian books for noncommittal 
perusing. The walls are scattered 
with vintage sketches of animal 
anatomies. 

According to Annese, Molaison’s 
brain won’t “hit the fan” for another 
two months — but once the 35-con-

secutive-hour procedure goes down, 
the resulting slides will be broadcast 
live on the Internet. 

Most important to Annese is that 
a wide audience be able to use the 
mounted results: Scientists will have 
access to the brain and will be able 
to request specific slides for their 
research, while high school teachers 
could use the brain atlases to teach 
basic lessons in anatomy.

“It’s about sharing resources, 
sharing tools, because [researchers] 
realize that everyone does [the work 
in] their own way,” Annese said.

Annese hopes to see the brain 
cut and mounted by summer’s end.

“Once we start cutting, it’s really 
going to be a tour de force,” he said.

because they couldn’t adjust right 
away,” Justice said. “There isn’t a whole 
lot of awareness or compassion in this 
neighborhood for families who don’t 
speak English as their first language.” 

According to the ECEC Web site, 
the center will try to adapt ICNS’s 
vision to build a multicultural com-
munity for UCSD families. Its cur-
rent curriculum is based on the 
Reggio Emilia approach to learn-
ing — a hands-on model that uses 
children’s imaginations to guide the 
curriculum. 

However, many parents still feel 
that the ECEC won’t cater to their 
needs as well as the ICNS.  

“It was more expensive, the hours 
weren’t as friendly and we had no 

options for lunch. We just decided not 
to [enroll our child in ECEC],” ICNS 
board president Stephanie Schmidt 
said. 

A small group of affiliates, par-
ents and teachers from the ICNS are 
searching for a new location off cam-
pus, where they aim to recreate the 
same flexible and diverse environment 
for the children of faculty, students 
and visiting scholars. 

 “You cannot negotiate your child’s 
education,” math professor and ICNS 
parent Jacques Verstraete said. “Your 
child needs to go somewhere. A place 
like this on campus is a huge benefit 
for the university.”

WEEKLY
Reversing the Lens: Representations of Women 
in Art: An art exhibit presenting the works of 
female artists on campus and in the local com-
munity. Throughout history, women have been 
objectified, commodified, and hypersexualized 
in art works, rendered as objects to be gazed 
at by typically male viewers. The purpose of 
this exhibition is to give women artists the 
opportunity to “reverse the lens,” so to speak, 
and give them the opportunity to represent 
themselves. March 2-13 at the Cross Cultural 
Center ArtSpace.

already be out. Topics are determined by group 
participants, and can include coming out to 
yourself, coming out to family, coming out to 
friends, coming out and the work place, and 
coming out at school. For more information,

on its home court that gave the regular season 
CCAA co-champs an 11 point lead. The Tritons 
responded with a layup, offensive rebound and 
two free throws from Poppen and a layup from 
Kim.

“Our team plays with heart every time we 
step on the court — whether it be a practice or a 
game,” Poppen said. “With a senior-heavy lineup, 
we made sure that we gave everything that we 
possibly could to win the game.”

Down eight points with 4:45 remaining, Kim 
knocked down a three off a Poppen assist and 
then set up Husted’s triple on the Tritons’ fol-
lowing trip down the court. Poppen, an All-
CCAA second team member, tied the game on 
a layup with 3:01 remaining. After Cal State San 
Bernardino hit a three on the other end, Lawley 
responded with his fifth bucket from behind the 
arc, sending Triton fans into a frenzy.

With less than two minutes remaining, the 
Coyotes retook the lead on a jumper in the lane. 
Kim had a chance to give UCSD its first lead of 
the second half, but his three was just off the 
mark. After two free throws from All-CCAA 
First Team member Devin Montgomery, four-
year Tritons Lawlor and Poppen teamed up for 
one more perfectly executed play. Lawlor’s pass 
inside set up an easy Poppen layup as the Tritons 
cut the deficit to two with 19 seconds remain-
ing. Montgomery hit 1-of-2 from the line on the 
other end and the Tritons had two chances to tie. 
Unfortunately, Husted’s three missed and Kim’s 
attempt from beyond the arc following a clutch 
offensive rebound was off as well.

Lawley, who joined Kim and Poppen as first-
time recipients of All-CCAA honors, scored a 
game-high 24 points, connecting on five of nine 
from three-point range. Poppen and Husted 
each scored 16 points, with Poppen adding a 
game-high eight rebounds. Kim concluded his 
collegiate career with seven points, a game-high 
six assists and three rebounds.

“[The seniors] have absolutely set a tone for 
this program, every single one of them,” Carlson 
said following the final collegiate games for 
seniors Husted, Kim, Poppen, Lawlor, Stuckey, 
Patrick Dreith and A.J. Malhaurdt. “There’s guys 
like Kelvin and Shane, guys who have played a 
ton of minutes. Patrick Dreith didn’t play a ton of 
minutes for us, but always came to practice with 
his head up and worked his tail off. They are such 

great representatives for our university. Every one 
of them takes the term student-athlete to heart.”

UCSD shot 46.2 percent from the field, 
including 42.3 percent from three-point range as 
its 11 threes matched a season-high. The Tritons 
were undone by an incredible shooting perfor-
mance from the Coyotes, who shot a blistering 
61.5 percent from the field in the second half and 
finished 27-for-47 for the game.

Despite having defeated Humboldt State 
twice during the season, including during the 
first round of the CCAA Tournament, the 
Lumberjacks were selected as the West Region’s 
eighth seed, while UCSD was left on the outside 
looking in, failing to receive an at-large bid to the 
NCAA tournament. 

“I came in as a tall, lanky freshman who 
thought I knew what it meant to be a college 
basketball player,” Poppen said. “I quickly learned 
how hard you must work to contribute and be 
successful at this level. Our team was very young 
when I was a freshman and it was amazing to see 
the progress and how we learned from our expe-
rience to eventually win the CCAA tourney and 
host a postseason game. This team has worked 
so hard, but most importantly we have stuck 
together through everything.”

With their 2008-09 season at an end, the 
Tritons are already looking ahead to next year.

“There’s a legacy that’s been set here in the 
last two years,” Carlson said. “To get back to this 
game and be able to win it, we have a lot of work 
to do. I like our talent level, I like where we’re at as 
a program and we just have got to keep working 
our tails off.” 

The 2008-09 Tritons recorded the program’s 
highest finish (fourth) and best record in the 
CCAA (13-7), its highest regular-season record 
in Division II history (16-10) and had three 
players awarded All-CCAA recognition for the 
first time. The team also won its first-ever home 
playoff game.

“It’s those things you talk about, way back 
during your first meeting in September,” Carlson 
said. “You never ever, ever quit. There’s just 
no stopping this team’s effort and I think that 
showed [against Cal State San Bernardino]. I’m 
just so proud to be their head coach. They make 
me proud, they really do.”

With the Tritons down 4­1, the junior  
started UCSD’s comeback in a come­
from­behind victory in No. 3 doubles 

against Hawaii Pacific on March 2.

By Liam Rose
Contributing Writer

TRACK & FIELD — Racing at the 
Triton Track and Field Stadium for the 
last time until late April, UCSD took 
complete advantage of its home field.

The Tritons breezed through the 
San Diego City Championships last 
Saturday, with both the men’s and 
women’s teams winning handily. 
The women scored 225 points, beat-
ing runner-up San Diego State by 30 
and obliterating Cal State San Marcos 
and Point Loma Nazarene. The men  
scored 156.5, defeating second-place 
Point Loma by 38 points.

“We thought we would win by a 
slim margin on the men’s side, and 
we thought the women’s side would 
be pretty even,” head coach Tony 
Salerno said. “The last six years the 
women had gone 2-2-1 against SDSU, 
and this was out biggest margin of 
victory yet.”

The Triton women had big relay 

races, winning comfortably in the 
4x400 meter relay and edging out 
SDSU in the 4x100. Junior Christine 
Merrill and senior Katie Scorupa ran 
on both relay teams, and sophomore 
record holder Kelly Fogarty anchored 
the 4x100 meter team in addition to 
winning the 100 meter dash. Merrill 
also won the 200 meter dash and fin-
ished fourth in the 100 meter hurdles. 
Junior Linda Rainwater showed why 
she is the reigning conference cham-
pion in the heptathlon, running on the 
4x400 team, winning the high jump 
with the same height that helped her 
snag 11th place in last season’s NCAA 
Championships and coming in second 
in the 800 meter run. 

In the distance events, sophomore 
Bre Schofield won the 1500 meter run 
with a time of 4:34, dominating her 
race and winning by 14 seconds. In 
all, the women’s team won 13 of their 
18 events. 

Junior Mike Wright, who placed 
first in the 1500 meter run, empha-

sized the perks of competing at home.
“We have one of the best facilities 

I have ever competed in, because it’s 
just for track and field, and we don’t 
have to share it with other programs,” 
Wright said. 

The men were led by junior Casey 
Ryan, also a guard for the basketball 
team, who tied a school record of 6’11’’ 
in the high jump. Ryan bested his 
personal record by a quarter inch one 
day after playing in UCSD’s conference 
semifinal basketball game. 

Junior Fred Cook won the shot put 
and hammer throw and placed third 
in the discus. Senior Scott Tsuda took 
the triple jump by nearly four feet and 
placed third in the long jump. 

On the track, senior Connor 
McCabe swept the 100 and 200 meter 
dashes and junior Leon Baham won 
both the 400 meter hurdles and 110 
meter high hurdles.

WOMEN’S TENNIS — The women’s 
tennis team started off an incredible 
week of action with an upset vic-
tory over regional rival Hawaii Pacific 
University on March 2. It had been 
three years since the Tritons last beat 
the Sea Warriors, but junior Anita 
Athavale and senior Tessa Tran both 
secured comeback wins to end the 
streak.

“It was so rewarding to finally beat 
Hawaii Pacific,” Tran said. “We had 
come so close to beating them in the 
past, and I felt like I had to win this 
match so that our team could finally 
get over that hump and prove to our-
selves that we can play at their level.”

Following the win, the Tritons 
took care of business in California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
play, a routine job for head coach 
Liz LaPlante’s group. UCSD posted 
wins over Cal Poly Pomona (8-1), 
Sonoma State (8-1) and Cal State San 
Bernardino (9-0), improving to an 8-2 
overall and 7-0 league record. The 
wins also helped extend the Tritons’ 
streak of 56 consecutive wins over 
conference opponents.

“I take pride in how competitive 
and deep my team is, and getting 
things done in our conference is a 
constant reminder of what our hard 
work is accomplishing,” LaPlante said. 

With none of UCSD’s conference 
opponents getting in the team’s way 
so far this season, the Tritons are rid-
ing a wave of momentum that will 
likely lead them to a sixth consecu-
tive CCAA title. UCSD has won its 
seven league matches by a combined 
score of 57-6, and owns a three-game 
lead over Sonoma State and Cal Poly 
Pomona. The surging Tritons will host 

Rollins College on March 10, Florida 
Southern College on March 13 and 
Cal State Stanislaus in a CCAA match 
on March 14.

Hawaii Pacific had beaten the 
Tritons three times over the past two 
seasons, including once in the 2007 
Division-II NCAA Tournament. This 
match had a much different feel as 
UCSD stood up to its rival from the 
beginning; all three doubles matches 
were hotly contested, setting the tone 
for the rest of the afternoon. 

UCSD took a 1-0 lead when the 
Sea Warriors’ No. 2 doubles retired 
due to injury while trailing 5-2 
against Athavale and sophomore 
Natalie Varnay. In the No. 1 doubles 
match, senior Ina Dan and sopho-
more Taskeen Bains battled Hawaii 
Pacific before succumbing to an 8-6 
loss. Hawaii Pacific grabbed the final 
doubles point at the No. 3 seed on 
an entertaining 9-8 win over UCSD’s 
sophomore Valerie Tang and Tran.

“Our team felt like we should have 
won all three doubles matches,” Tran 
said. “In our match, we fought hard to 
come back from a 7-4 deficit to force 
a tiebreaker. We felt really good about 
our chances in the breaker, so when we 
lost it we were very upset.”

Trailing 2-1 entering singles play, 
UCSD quickly found itself in a deeper 
deficit after two lopsided defeats. With 
their backs against the wall and down 
4-1, the Tritons conjured up some of 
their best tennis to snatch the improb-
able win. Tang, at the No. 4 position, 
and Bains, at the No. 5 seed helped

MEN’S BASKETBALL — One year ago, 
Cal State San Bernardino’s Coussoulis 
Arena was filled with a jubilant UCSD 
team. The Tritons battled from the 
seventh seed all the way to the CCAA 
Tournament Championship game, 
pulling their third upset in three games 
to win the program’s first-ever confer-
ence championship. Players, includ-
ing the entire nucleus of this year’s 
squad, and fans celebrated with then-
first-year head coach Chris Carlson 
as the Tritons defeated Cal State San 
Bernardino, San 
Francisco State 
and Cal Poly 
Pomona in one 
week to earn 
their first-ever 
berth into the 
NCAA Division-
II Tournament.

The UCSD men’s basketball team 
again reached the culmination of its 
season at Coussoulis Arena on Friday, 
but the squad was unable to repeat as 
CCAA champions, falling in the semi-
finals to host Cal State San Bernardino 
76-72. The eventual CCAA champion 
Coyotes improved to 19-9, leaving 
UCSD with a 17-11 overall record.

“Tonight was a great college bas-
ketball game, it really was,” head coach 
Chris Carlson said. “I thought we per-
formed at a high level, just not quite 
high enough.”

The Tritons worked to take the San 
Bernardino crowd out of the game 
early, grabbing a 16-9 advantage in the 
first half following a three-pointer by 
senior guard Alan Husted off a pass 
from freshman guard Jay Wey. Cal 

State San Bernardino cut the advantage 
to two, before Husted turned a steal 
into two free throws. Senior forward 
Brett Stuckey followed up with a steal 
and a three-pointer, pushing the lead to 
seven. The Coyotes then went scoreless 
for over three minutes before an 8-0 
run, punctured by CCAA Newcomer 
of the Year Brandon Brown’s three-
point play with 4:05 left in the half.

“Brown was definitely a tough chal-
lenge and he played very well,” senior 
forward Shane Poppen said.

Trailing for the first time in the 
game, the Tritons fell by as much as 
six with one minute remaining in the 

half. Junior for-
ward Jordan 
Lawley helped 
UCSD take back 
some momentum, 
hitting his second 
three of the half 
following an assist 

by senior guard and All-CCAA First 
Team Honoree Kelvin Kim. Senior for-
ward Darryl Lawlor helped cut the lead 
to one, converting an assist by junior 
guard Tyler Acevedo for a layup right 
before halftime.

Brown led the Coyotes out of the 
gates in the second half, scoring seven 
of his team-high 22 points in the first 
six and a half minutes of the final 
period. Following another successful 
three-point play from Brown, UCSD 
found itself down eight with 13:31 
left in the game. Lawley and Husted 
responded by each connecting on a 
three-pointer to again cut the Tritons’ 
deficit down to one possession.

Cal State San Bernardino fired 
right back, putting together a 13-4 run
