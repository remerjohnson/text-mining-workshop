Protesters gathered around City Hall 
last Friday afternoon for the “Occupy San 
Diego” protest, in solidarity with New 
York City’s ongoing “Occupy Wall Street” 
movement.

The ‘Occupations’ — which started in 
New York City on Sept. 17 — have traveled 
across the country to cities like Chicago, 
Seattle and San Francisco. “Occupy San 
Diego” occurred on Oct. 7, one week after 
‘Occupy Los Angeles’ on Oct. 1. Police 
estimated nearly 1,500 people attended the 
protest.

These peaceful protests organized via 
Facebook and Twitter voiced a variety 
of issues, including corporate greed, 
unemployment and an uneven distribution 
of wealth in this country.

These national mobilizations have 
been a leaderless and loosely organized 
movement that defines itself as a “people 
powered movement for democracy.”  

Canadian advocacy magazine Adbusters 
posted a call for action on July 2011 on its 
blog, which set off the series of protests.

On Sept. 17, a group in New York calling 
itself “The General Assembly,” — taking 
inspiration from the recent uprising in 
Tahrir Square in Egypt and from the 
Spanish acampadas in Madrid this summer 
— encouraged activists to flood Lower 
Manhattan in order to occupy Wall Street. 

Authorities later moved the protestors 
from the financial district to the new base 
on Zucotti Park, a privately owned park in

A sinkhole caused by a broken 
storm drain opened in the middle of 
Campus Point Drive on Thursday, 
Oct. 6. The hole grew to 50 feet in 
length and 25 feet in width.

The collapse occurred around 
7:20 a.m. and was reported to the 
police at 7:30 a.m. The sinkhole 
was very close to the intersection of 
Campus Point Drive and Campus 
Point Center, north of Scripps 
Memorial Hospital.

A sinkhole is an erosion of land 
caused when underground water 
dissolves minerals in the ground. A 
buried hole is created and as it gets 
larger, the land on top caves in.

A broken 30-inch diameter 
storm drain caused the hole to form 
15 feet beneath the surface. The 
drain ruptured below the street 
and its runoff eroded the ground 
beneath the pavement. Dirt fell into 
the storm pipelines, clogging it and 
causing water to pool. 

Raw sewage ran into the pool 
after the dirt also cracked a 10-inch 
sewer pipe. 

San Diego storm water 
department spokesman Bill Harris 
said the storm pipelines had been 
installed in 1972 — the most recent 
pipes installed in the city were 
installed in 1992. 

Harris said that Wednesday’s 
rain likely added to the erosion 
of  the decaying metal storm drain. 
The San Diego Water Department 
shut off the water main of the 
neighborhood in case of additional 
cave-ins. 

This affected 30  businesses in the 
area including Qualcomm, SAIC 
and the Campus Point Technology 
Center, the University City business 
park and residents in the area. The 
Scripps Memorial Hospital was not 
affected by the shutoff. Water was 
restored to the businesses Thursday 
night, but the water main remains 
shut off. Temporary sewer and

U CSD’s annual FallFest is no more. After a 13-year run, budget cuts have threat-ened the festival’s success — thus the 
A.S. Concerts & Events  office is re-branding 
the festival into “Hullabaloo,” which is planned 
to take place Nov. 18 in conjunction with 
Founders’ Day. 

“We knew definitely that we needed a different 
name to make it feel like we were starting a new 
tradition,” Associate Vice President of Concerts 
& Events Oliver Zhang said. “[Keeping] the 
name FallFest would be misleading because 
it is such a different event. We wanted to give 
this event a new life. We thought a lot about the 
name, and we wanted a name that sounded like 
a really fun celebration.”

Founders’  Day — which featured the artist 
Far East Movement last year — will take place 
on Nov. 18 during the day with Hullabaloo 
following at 6 p.m. to 11:45 p.m. using the same 
stage setup. Unlike FallFest, which was held at 
the Warren Mall, Hullabaloo will held be in the 

Town Square and Matthews Quad.
“We had to revamp Fall Fest,” Zhang said. 

“To go with the Fall Fest we had in previous 
years would be a disservice to students because 
of financial reasons. It wouldn’t [have met] 
students’ expectations from the past and I think 
it would’ve just been a bad decision for all of us.”

Hullabaloo will feature both UCSD musicians 
and outside musicians that have yet to be 
released, as well as carnival rides, food trucks 
and other attractions. 

“I think given the success of events like the 
“All Campus Dance” or the dance tent at Sun 
God proves to us that we don’t really need a big 
headliner to draw students,” Zhang said. 

The festival will also allow re-entry, another 
feature that Zhang felt FallFest lacked.

“The lineup never really felt consistent,” 
Zhang said. “Attendance dropped the previous 
year from two years ago so I think there was 
a fundamental issue with FallFest. It wasn’t as 
sustainable a tradition as I think Hullabaloo 
will be.”

FallFest, which traditionally featured one or 
two headliner artists such as The Game in 

2009 and Big Boi in 2010, did not live up to  
Zhang’s expectations. The festival’s budget was 
cut by $75,000 from the original $135,000 for 
Fall Fest 2010 to the Hullabaloo budget of only 
$60,000. ASCE took the cut as an opportunity 
to re-brand FallFest from a night concert to a 
festival that will no longer be focused around 
one headliner artist. Although Hullabaloo is 
replacing FallFest, Zhang emphasized that this a 
completely new festival. 

“I thought there was a problem with the 
format of Fall Fest in general because it was more 
of a concert than a festival, which is perfectly 
fine but that’s just not what I envisioned,” Zhang 
said. “Regardless of any financial reasons, I 
think I would have [changed] Fall Fest anyway.” 

Zhang expects a turnout of about 4,000 UCSD 
students. The lineup will be released Oct. 31. 

“I think it’s hard to compare Hullabaloo and 
Fall Fest,” Zhang said. “They’re very different. 
I would have changed the format of Fall Fest 
regardless of the budget.”

LIGHTS & SIRENS “Occupy San Diego” Members Continue Protest Indefinitely 

University City Road Closed While Workers Make Sinkhole Repairs

water lines were put above ground for 
the businesses that have been affected 
by the broken drain. They will remain 
in place until the water main can be 
turned on again. Large hoses were 
used to vacuum out the liquid. 

A pipeline of reclaimed water and 
a bundle of telephone and fiber optic 
lines are running above the pipes. 

An electrical line runs adjacent to 
the hole. Harris said they needed to 

stabilize the utilities and find a way to 
repair the drain without damage. He 
had no estimate on when the roadway 
pipes will be repaired.

“We won’t be digging there until 
we know how much pipe we have 
to replace, how much we have 
to dig, then decide if we need an 
outside contractor and determine a 
funding source,” Harris said in an 
Oct. 7 San Diego Union-Tribune article 
“University City Road Still Closed for 

Sinkhole.”
Workers in the area were surprised 

by sinkhole.
“We just kind of looked at each 

other and said wow, we were driving 
over that for weeks,” Qualcomm 
worker Brian Padgett said in the Oct. 
6 article of 10News, “Sinkhole Closes 
Street in University City.”

Lower Manhattan that was formerly 
known as Liberty Plaza Park. The 
protestors still remain at Zucotti 
Park to date.

“The future of the human race 
requires the cooperation of its 
members,” the General Assembly 
said in an Oct. 1 statement. 

The statement further explained 
that it is up to the individuals to 
protect their own rights and 
their neighbor’s rights, and that 
corporations do not see a problem 
with extracting wealth from the 
people and the earth. 

Occupy San Diego began at 4:30 
p.m. on Oct. 7. 

Hundreds of residents marched 
from San Diego’s Children’s Park 
downtown towards Civic Center 
Plaza where they planned to stage a 
sit-in at City Hall. 

The group however, agreed to move 
back to Children’s Park because of a 
pre-scheduled religious observance 
at Civic Center Plaza for Yom Kippur.

There were no arrests reported 
as protestors settled in downtown’s 
Children’s Park, where many planned 
to spend the night camping outdoors.

“Everybody’s been good,” Shawn 
Murphy of the San Diego Police 
Department said. “Everyone’s been 
good and getting their point across.”

The demonstration, which is 
planned to last indefinitely, has no 
official list of demands.

“There are so 
many things to 
protest,” Harry 
Simón Salazar 
said, a graduate 
student from 
the UCSD 
Department of 
Communication. 
“I’m not out here 
to protest [just] 
one thing.”

Simón said he 
had originally 
been downtown 
earlier that day 
to show support 
for the California 
Dream Act, 

which was signed by Gov. Brown on 
Oct. 9. 

The Dream Act would give 
undocumented students of good 
character access to state-funded 
financial aid and permanent 
residency.

“It doesn’t matter whether it’s 
a Republican or Democrat in 
government, it’s a continuity of crises 
ranging from war, bank bailouts, 
home foreclosures, unemployment, 
cuts to social services, corporate 

domination of the electoral process 
and the list continues,” Simón said.

The crowds have a variety of issues 
to voice, but their primary concerns 
stem from the perception that Wall 
Street and banking institutions 
control most of the money.

In a news conference last Thursday, 
President Obama said that people 
were angry because Wall Street had 
not been following the rules.

The protestors call themselves “the 
99 percent” of the population who 
continues to struggle as the economy 
gets worse and unemployment rises, 
while “the 1 percent” who has the 
vast majority of the country’s wealth 
continues to prosper. 

Many protestors carried candles 
that they hoped to burn through the 
night. 

Food and drinks were donated to 
protestors and musical instruments 
resonated throughout the park. 

Protestors downtown have vowed 
to stay as long as they can.

As of Sunday afternoon, about 500 
protestors were still occupying the 
Civic Center and made a request 
through the “Occupy San Diego” 
Facebook page to receive blankets 
and sleeping bags.

Tweets, photos and very many full-
length articles — to leave my laptop 
forever overwhelmed by the rainbow

happily, no one’s had two words to

Trigger Happy
The Parent Empowerment Act, which allows parents to take judicial action 

against underperforming schools, may lead to more controversy than improvement.

BY HILARY LEE • STAFF WRITER

Parents of students at chronically underper-forming public schools now have the ability to shut schools down by banding together, 
thanks to the Parent Empowerment Act that 
California adopted in January 2010. This “trigger 
law” gives parents considerable legal power in the 
educational system, sparking a debate over whether 
this power is being placed in the right hands. 
According to the at, if 51 percent of parents agree 
that a school’s system is not working, they can “trig-
ger” change by demanding that one of four options 
be taken: ousting the principal, replacing the staff, 
shutting the school down entirely or allowing a 
charter operator to take control of the school. 
California, Texas and Mississippi have all passed 
parent trigger laws in the past two years, while 22 
other states are entertaining the idea of implement-
ing similar laws. Though well-intentioned, these 

“parent trigger” laws foster opportunities for the 
unwitting misuse of power, since parents don’t have 
the expertise of career educators and are unquali-
fied to make big policy changes. Signing a petition 
does not automatically solve the problem — pulling 
the “trigger” in fact, has powerful recoil. 

As a general trend, California schools are on a 
downturn. At the Los Angeles Academy Middle 
School, for example, only 1 in 5 students tested 
proficient in math last year, and only 1 in 4 were 
found to be proficient in language arts. Unrelenting 
problems like these have caused impatient des-
perate parents to turn to the district and school 
administration. Woodcrest Elementary School, also 
in Los Angeles, is in a similar situation; there, frus-
trated parents hold small group meetings and draw 
up lists of action items, as only an alarmingly low 
0.2 percent of the school’s students have been iden-

tified as gifted. It’s understandable 
that parents are trying to seek their 
own answers to the system’s prob-
lems, but giving them power a la the 
Parent Empowerment Act may not 
be the most effective tactic.

Parent trigger laws have pro-
duced failure in the past, as in 
the case of Compton’s McKinley 
Elementary in February 2011. 
The school has an Academic 
Performance Index score of 684 
(out of a maximum of 800), plac-
ing itself at the bottom of Compton 
Unified School District. Half of the 
students at the school did not meet 
state standards in math and read-
ing, prompting hundreds of parents 
to sign a petition to transform 
McKinley into a charter school. The 
school responded by challenging 
the petition’s validity — teachers 
are arguing that the signatures were 
obtained improperly and therefore 
the petition is void. The struggle 
between the new “parent union” 
and the teacher union has created a 
months-long deadlock in court. The 
situation at Compton exemplifies 
how ineffective and counterproduc-
tive these judicial battles can be. The 
California Federation of Teachers 
labeled the law “lynch mob” legisla-
tion, as it essentially creates parent 
unions that challenge teachers with 
threats of bringing the legal system 
into the equation.

Under the “parent trigger law,” 
parents would be allowed to select 
which charter school operator 
they would like to take over their 
children’s schools. The newly hired 
administrators of the schools would 
be given great flexibility in staffing, 
budgeting and scheduling. This 
poses a problem as most parents 
lack the expertise to select a quality 
administrator, which could worsen 
a situation already in decline.

Furthermore, charter schools are not 
an end-all solution to the problem. 
Results are far less positive than 
studies suggest. Stanford economist 
Margaret Raymond conducted a 
national study, in which she found 
that 37 percent of charter schools 
performed worse than their public 
school counterparts, 46 percent 
performed the same and only 17 
percent showed superior results.

Another major concern is that 
the obstacle of funding school 
changes would render the parent 
trigger law ineffective. Many unin-
formed, idealistic parents believe 
that they have done their part by 
simply signing a petition, and expect 
the rest to automatically fall into 
place. If anything, the trigger law is 
merely a jumping point for parents 
to organize and rally around their 
interests. As of last May, California 
is in a $25-billion state budget 
deficit. In the past few years, half 
of the state’s schools have cut back 
on instructional days, two-thirds 
have taken out summer school and 
three-quarters of high schools have 
enlarged their class sizes. Changing 
public schools into charter schools 
and replacing staff would be an 
expensive, extensive process that 
involves paying for legal fees. 
Parents do not realize that funding 
a transformation of the educational 
system would be impossible in this 
financial crisis.

While the trigger law grants 
parents more of a voice in the 
educational system, with it comes 
responsibility and the looming 
shadow of unavoidable issues such 
as financing. The law is a theoreti-
cal move in the right direction, but 
requires much more than abstract 
idealism to actually be put into 
practice.

And still, there’s the truth: that words like “visionary” 
and “revolutionary” are the ones that fit. That there is no 
way to know how far the digital revolution might have 
reached if not for Jobs and his notorious perfectionism. 
That the public outcry in his passing is inescapable, but 
more than that — it’s deserved. 

My Apple fandom started young. Before we had 
a computer at home, my dad would often bring his 
PowerBook home from work. It was years before the 
iPod, and probably before I’d even committed two weeks’ 
allowance to that first Britney Spears CD. 

The laptop was strictly for company business, but 
mysteriously, it also possessed the holy grail that was Kid 
Pix — you know, the drawing program that let the gifted 
children paint late-90s masterpieces, while I made lots 
and lots of stick figures. (And in different colors, too!) 

In an instance of hilarious/terrifying foreshadowing, 

that was where all the clamoring began. Dad, can I get on 
Kid Pix now? What about 20 seconds from now? 

By middle school, it was the iPod that I wouldn’t shut 
up about and then the Macbook and then — let’s just say 
it’s been an ugly descent from age eight. 

Naysayers like to trot out the same old argument that 
Apple products are only popular for their status (an argu-
ment that isn’t totally weightless, even if my old laptop is 
several coffee spills beyond its beauty pageant days). 

But naturally, they’re short on ammo when it comes 
to the company’s (i.e., Jobs’) role in revolutionizing the 
way we interact both with technology and with each 
other. A thousand songs in your pocket sounds like a 
quaint promise in 2011, but it was a radical one just a 
decade ago. I can’t imagine what I’d have filled an iPod 
with then (there weren’t a thousand  “….Baby One More 
Time” remixes). But what’s even more unfathomable is 
just how much more Jobs could have done with another 
decade.

 M.A. in Sport Management
An evening Master’s program to build managerial, marketing, 
and strategic skills in the sport marketplace. Now accepting 
applications for classes starting in July 2012.

F
rom fancy coaches to 
expensive Kaplan classes, 
there’s a multi-billion 
dollar industry dedicated 

to helping people perform when 
it really matters. But, says UCSD 
alumnus Sian Beilock, the key to 
succeeding when the stakes are 
high isn’t just clocking in as many 
hours as possible, but practicing in 
the right environment. And once 
someone is in front of the test 
booklet —  or the podium, or the 
�eld —  the secret to preventing a 
breakdown is captured by one very 
short, very famous phrase: Just do it. 

Beilock is a cognitive scientist 
known for her research into 
“choking,” or why even highly 
trained professionals break down 
under pressure. She’s worked 
with novice golfers to discover 
that overthinking leads to failure, 
and elementary school teachers 
to identify why young girls are 
afraid of math. Her �ndings 
stem from an interest that began 
when she was an undergrad at 
Marshall College, feeling pressure 
in and out of the classroom.

Beilock, now an associate 
professor of psychology at the 
University of Chicago, is well-
known for her research and has 
been featured on NPR, the New 
York Times and the Wall Street 
Journal, but the alumnus said she 
wasn’t always intent on becoming a 
scientist. At one point, the Bay Area 
native was interested in law school, 
and it was only an 11th-hour change 
of heart that led her to La Jolla.

“I had already decided that 
I was going to go to Amherst,” 
she said. “But at the last second, I 
decided that UCSD was right for 

me because of the programs in 
psych and cog sci and I thought it’d 
be nice to be so close to the beach.”

It was at UCSD that classes 
such as Introduction to Cognitive 
Science and Cognitive Psychology 
whetted her interest in the 
workings of the mind. Beilock also 
played on the lacrosse team for 
four years, and here her interest in 
athleticism intersected with classes 
to help develop her area of research.

“In cog sci, I started learning 
about how people got good at what 
they do, but there wasn’t a whole lot 
of information about why people 
screw up,” Beilock said. “I was 
feeling the pressure in the classroom 
and on the lacrosse �eld, and so I 
became interested in the topic early.”

�ese dual interests in 
human performance and the 
brain continued a�er Beilock 
graduated in 1997 with a degree 
in cognitive science. She next 
earned two PhDs,  in kinesiology 
and psychology, from Michigan 
State University in 2003. 

In one study published when 
Beilock was still a graduate 
student, she and her colleagues 
split 54 novice golfers into three 
groups and then trained them in 
di�erent environments A control 
group learned under normal 
conditions, but the researchers 
engineered “distracting” and “self-
conscious” environments for the 
two other groups. Members of 
the distraction group were asked 
to practice while listening to a 
tape and repeating a target word 
while, most terrifyingly, the �nal 
group trained with a video camera

mental illness – I thought I was just having 

some bad days. Then, I learned that 1 in 4 

adults experience mental health challenges 

such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder 

and others. I got help and now I am moving 

forward with my life. Recovery is possible and 

getting help is an important first step.

Mental illness

and the rather grim assertion that pros would be judging the tapes. 
�e groups were then tested in two situations, one with low 

pressure and one  where the athletes were told that improvement 
would result in monetary awards. All the golfers performed equally 
on the low-pressure test, but  when the stakes were high, the 
video camera performed better, while the normal group choked.

Beilock said that this and similar experiments show that practicing 
in an environment that mimics the actual competition fends o� 
underperformance. She gave the example of test preparation —  while 
a student’s vocab cards and test-taking strategies might predict good 
scores, the trick to having a satisfying repeat on the real thing is taking 
timed practices, not reviewing the meaning of “peroration” yet again.

And when test day comes, the  key is  to stop second-guessing 
yourself and think about something else. Under high-stress 
situations, especially athletic competition, the working memory 
portion of the brain begins overthinking movements that are usually 
automatic, thus disrupting the mind’s �ow. Beilock found that 
when golfers count backwards by threes or sings a song, the working 
memory is occupied, unable to overthink, and people do better. 

“Sometimes, being conscious of our movements makes us choke,” she 
said. “It causes anxiety when you’re thinking ‘oh, my knee is contracting 
like this and my elbow is contracting like that,’ and paying too much 
attention creates a buildup that wastes valuable space in the brain.”

For those who don’t fancy humming aloud on the LSAT, a 
separate experiment showed that having students write about 
test worries for 10 minutes before the exam improved their 
scores, especially for those who usually su�er from text anxiety. 

“�ink of the mind like a computer,” she said. “All those worries 
deplete the working memory of your brain, so instead of focusing on 
the actual issue at hand, you’re distracted by your worries. So writing it 
down frees the attention and lets people better focus on the task at hand.”

Now, Beilock has a grant from the Department of Education to 
study math anxiety. She found that teachers, especially female teachers 
at the elementary school level, are o�en anxious about their own 
mathematical skills, and can pass this along to their students. Namely, 
the more insecure teacher is about her math abilities, the more her 
students are likely to believe the stereotype that boys are good at 
math and girls at reading, even if there was no previous di�erence. 

In addition to her continuing work on performance under 
pressure, and new research on elementary education, Beilock 
turned her �ndings into a book called Choke, published in 2010.

“I really think scientists have a responsibility to share their �ndings 
with everyone,” she said. “Especially if it impacts people like this and can 
have a positive e�ect on how people work. I use the writing technique 
now, everyone in my lab does, we all do what we can to improve our lives.”

After losing to Sonoma State, 
UCSD now sits at No. 16 in the 
national ranking. The Tritons will 
face the Seawolves again on Friday, 
Nov. 4 at UCSD. 

Continuing their road trip up 
North, the Tritons managed to pull 
together a victory, beating Cal State 
East Bay 3-2. 

The Otters took the first two 
sets, 21-25 and 20-25, leading the 
match by halftime, and then the 
Tritons dug themselves out of the 
deficit and took the next three sets.

“At times we’ve shown that we 
can bounce back from being down, 
and I think as long as we keep get-
ting better—and we know that we 
can—I think we’ll be secure for the 
rest of the season,” Luyties said.

Following the second set the 
Tritons would have 35 kills to Cal 
State East Bay’s 26 kills.

UCSD took the third set with a 
commanding 25-12 score, and also 
won the fourth set 25-21 and the 
fifth set 15-13.

Williamson had another strong 
performance, recording amongst 
the top scorers, contributing 14 of 

UCSD’s 55 kills and 26 digs.
Despite having a lower hitting 

percentage, UCSD outblocked CSU 
East Bay 8-7. 

Brunsting recorded 26 assists 
and 16 digs, while freshman Lauren 
Demos had 12 kills. 

Sophomore Lizzy Andrews 
chipped in with nine kills and seven 
digs. On the opposing side of the net 
Katie Allen served up 16 kills and 10 
digs of her own. The victory broke 
the Tritons’ losing streak, putting 
UCSD at 11-4 overall and 7-4 in the 
CCAA.

“On Monday we get the video of 

each team, and we’ll start scouting 
players to prepare for the coming 
matches,” Luyties said. “But for us 
right now, a lot of it is fixing things 
on our side. So we’ll start working 
on some of the things that we’ve 
been struggling with.”

The Tritons now sit in 4th place 
in the conference. 

UCSD will continue its away 
series on Friday Oct. 14 when the 
Tritons face 12-6 San Francisco 
State.

Tritons Defeat CSU East Bay, Fall to CSUSB and Monterey Bay

He developed the bike to suit a 
rider he was not, instead becoming 
a rider for whom the violent bike 
could work. 

In 2004, the precision exhibited 
by Rossi’s Honda days were gone, 
replaced by the power of Yamaha 
had taken over. 

For the next six years, Rossi won 
three more championships with 
Yamaha, refining his machine until 
once again, many began to attribute 
his success to his bike. 

Moving to Ducati in 2011, the 
Desmosedici GP11 is notorious-
ly hard to ride and bucks around 
much like the old Yamaha bike back 
in 2004. 

Similar to that year, Rossi has 
taken his crew and chief with him 
to Ducati, and although the results 
have not shown this time around, 
next year will be an amazing year 
for Ducati, as this song has been 
sung before with Rossi.

The GP11, the current Ducati 
race bike, will be changed next year 
to conform to the changing FIM 
rules on displacement. 

So this year Rossi has been 
focusing on the GP12, the changed 
version, 

This has limited his success in 
2011 but makes 2012, with a supe-
rior set up that none of the other 
teams can match, almost a sure year 
for the Ducati.

A win in the coming year would 
bump Rossi to number one in the 
number of MotoGP Championships 
titles, currently held by Giacomo 
Agostini who holds eight champi-
onship victories.

of the race with a just a short stretch 
of ground between himself and the 
next pack of racers, which held almost 
the entire field of Triton competitors. 
UCSD finished 7th -10th, 12th -14th, 
16th, 20th and 24th. Collectively, the 
Triton men performed very well, with 
their average time clocking in lower 
than 20 seconds than the next fastest 
team.

The men’s team is also in conten-
tion for regional dominance. The only 
question is if it can curb the behemoth 
that is Chico State, enough to finally 
knock it off its high horse before the 
conference championships on Oct. 22 
in Santa Rosa.

The Tritons went 2-1 last week, suffering a loss at home against Cal State San Bernardino and coming up short to Cal 
State Monterey Bay, before beating Cal State 
East Bay on the road.

On Wednesday, the Tritons faced No. 3 Cal 
State San Bernardino, falling to the Coyotes in 
four sets. 

Against the undefeated Coyotes (11-0 over-

all), the Tritons could only muster a win in the 
second set.

UCSD recorded 42 kills, 5 sets and 79 digs 
in the campaign. 

Although they regained momentum by 
outhitting the Coyotes in the second set, Cal 
State San Bernardino still managed to rack up 
a better hitting percentage overall: .245 to .107. 

Despite the loss, senior outside hitter 
Hillary Williamson finished with a double-
double, tallying 16 kills and 12 digs. In addi-
tion, senior libero Janessa Werhane would 

Front of the Pack

The 2011 season of MotoGp was poised to be Ducati’s resurgence after losing Casey Stoner to the Repsol Honda team.  
The swan song was supposed to be writ-

ten to the tune of the insatiable el Doctor 
Valentino Rossi weaving his seven-time 
World Championship magic with Ducati; the 
quintessential Italian man riding the quintes-
sential Italian mark.

But things have not gone exactly to plan. 
Although Ducati and Rossi, along with 
American teammate Nicky Hayden, are sit-
ting sixth and seventh respectively, they are 
behind Ducati’s former ace and winner of the 
2007 MotoGP, Casey Stoner on the Repsol 
Honda RC211v as well as Rossi’s old team-
mate and rival from Yamaha, Jorge Lorenzo, 
who won in 2010. 

Dragging behind these top dogs may seem 
like a failing on the part of the rider or his 
bike, but the truth of the matter is, Ducati is 
well on its way to a championship title next 
year. 

This is due to the skill of Rossi and his 
crew to get bikes and manufacturer teams 
going in the right direction.

The difference between a rider that has 
won seven championships—Rossi—and a 
rider that has won one (on his way to two, 
admittedly), Casey Stoner, is in the ability to 
convey effective changes in a bike’s handling 
and performance to the pit crew and chief. 

Without this line of communication, rid-
ers and their teams fail to develop a bike that 
suits a particular rider. 

Even a fast bike for one individual does 
not make it a fast bike for another racer.

Rossi started the 2011 season after under-
going surgery on his left shoulder, making his 
testing and set up of the Desmosedici GP11 
sub par as the season got under way. 

However, after three races, he actually 
meddled at Le Mans in France, coming in 
third. 

This development, along with further 
changes in the FIM rules on the displace-
ment of the engines, showed glimpses of the 
Rossi brilliance that first became apparent 
back in 2003.

The last year Rossi rode with Repsol 
Honda, 2003, the Yamaha team bike was 
notoriously hard to ride. The bike finished 
seventh overall, even in the hands of Carlos 
Checa, renowned two stroke rider from the 
500cc era. 

Rossi won the overall championship in 
2003 on the infamously fast RC211v, and 
then took his entire pit crew and manage-
ment to Yamaha. 

Without changing the unruly bike much 
at all, Rossi changed his riding technique to 
suit the Yamaha, while other riders continued 
struggling with the bike, such as Checa, who 
finished seventh again in 2004.

By changing his riding style and with 
the effective support of his pit crew’s quick 
changes, Rossi won it all in 2004 on the same 
bike that could barely keep its tail in line in 
2003. 

The bike did not change dramatically, 
it was not majorly redesigned and even the 
paint scheme remained unchanged. 

Rossi’s skills did not improve dramatically, 
but he had such a good working communica-
tion with his engineers that he could request 
a change that would actually make the bike 
more violent, and thus easier to ride for him. 

Tritons End Three-Game Skid

By Nick Howe
Senior Staff Writer

The Triton cross country teams trounced the competition this weekend in the annual Triton Cross Country Invite, tak-
ing both team titles against strong competition 
from Division I schools.

Coach Nate Garcia said he was hopeful going 
into the meet, knowing his team was in a good 
place mentally and physically to make a strong 
showing. 

“It may sound cliche, but you always go out 
looking to do a little bit better,” Garcia said the 
day before the meet. “And you know, you go for 
the win.”

The women’s team took to the particularly 
challenging UCSD home course first for its 6k 
run. Junior Chia Chang and freshman Michelle 
LeRoux went straight to the head of the pack at 
the starting gun and successfully fought to hold 
their positions the entire race, finishing in third 
at 22:17.5 and fourth at 22:18.9, respectively. 

The Tritons did not record their fastest times 
at the meet, but the difficulty of UCSD’s course 
— replete with hills, valleys and dusty, muddy 
trails — differs dramatically from the flat grass 
fields where a lot of their other competitions 
have taken place.

This weekend, freshman Dani Brabender 
came in 10th, senior Aaryn Kobayashi came in 
12th, junior Ximena Cruz came in 14th, senior 

Kathryn Turner in 15th, freshman Alia Bales 
in 18th and freshman Madison Tanner came 
in 20th. 

The Tritons finished eight top 20 runners in 
a race composed of more than 120 athletes, and 
the Triton women easily took first place in the 
team component of the race. 

This season, the women’s cross country team 
is ripe with young talent, and runners filled with 
the desire to better themselves and beat the girl 
ahead. And with six freshmen and only four 
seniors, the year can only get better as these 
“baby” Tritons mature. 

The men’s team was led by junior Matt

contribute 29 digs of her own, while senior 
Roxanne Brunsting would have five kills, 
18 assists and 16 digs. 

Cal State San Bernardino standouts, 
Samantha Middleborn and Morgan Carty 
boasted 26 kills collectively. 

“We haven’t been playing our best these 
past few weeks,” head coach Ricci Luyties 
said. “In the past few matches we’ve strug-
gled in a lot of areas of play, against San 
Bernardino, Monterey Bay, East Bay, we 
just haven’t been at the top of our game.”

On Friday, the Tritons were dealt 
another disappointing loss as they met 
un-ranked Cal State Monterey Bay on the 
road. 

Monterey Bay started strong, victori-
ous in the first two sets of the match. 
Monterey Bay’s Rhean Fall racked up a 
hitting percentage of .268 and recorded 23 
kills to lead the Otters.

The scores were 19-25, 29-31, 25-21 
and 21-25. UCSD and CSUMB would go 
back and forth throughout the game, with 
a total of 17 lead changes. 

Outblocking Cal State Monterey Bay 
14-8, the Tritons trailed the Otters in kills 
(52-62), assists (49-58) and digs (84-93).

Brunsting totaled 18 assists and 25 
digs. She would also have a .333 hit-
ting percentage, tying Monique Sena of 
Cal State Monterey Bay for the top spot. 
Williamson would offer 12 kills and 15 
digs, with 19 assists from freshman Amber 
Hawthorne. 

This is the first time since September 
2010 that the Tritons have been dealt three 
consecutive losses.
