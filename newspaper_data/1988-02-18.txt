Critic - John Stockwell pOints to the CIA as a major cause of 
international conflict as he addresses the CAPSA conference. 

CAPSA 
Ex-CIA officer 
condemns agency 

By JINNY HUANG 
specltllfrom tlee St.II/ord Ddy 

The CIA is the ultimate threat 
to democracy and a major cause 
of the world's movement towards 
nuclear extinction, a former CIA 
agent told a convention of pro-
gressive students last Saturday 
in a packed auditorium at Stan-
ford University. 

John Stockwell, former CIA 
station chief in Africa and Viet-
nam, commander of the covert 
war in Angola, and advisor to 
the National Security Council 
under Henry Kissinger , ad -
dressed the second annual con-
ference ofthe Calfornian Alliance 
of Progressive Studellt Activists. 

Since leaving the CIA in 1977, 

Stockwell has been an outspoken 
critic of the agency. Stockwell 
congratulated the modern stu-
dent generation for the oppor-
tunity it has to understand its 
world and the intitiative it has 
taken towards that goa\. He then 
explained how he reached his 
anti-CIA stance. 

"Being in something doesn 't 
mean that you understand it ," 
Stockwell said . After the covert 
war in Angola, Stockwell claims 
he felt "like an Oliver North" 
because he realized that the 
Angola operation had not ad-
hered to any moral laws. 

Because he sees the Iran-
Contra affair as the pressing issue 
of the moment, Stockwell at-

Student activists discuss 
issues at Stanford meeting 

Resolutions adopted ,concerning homeless, 
nuclear test ban and other issues 

By JELGER KALMIJN 
specltllJrom tlte New /"dle.tor 

Two hundred student activists , 
including a contingent from 
UCSD, gathered last weekend at 
Stanford University for the se-
cond annual conference of the 
California Alliance of Progres-
sive Student Activists (CAPSA). 

The conference attendants 
heard speeches by ex-CIA agent 
John Stockwell and United Farm 
Workers vice president Dolores 
Huerta, among others, in addi-
tion to attending panel discus-
sions and issue caucuses. The 
speakers addressed a broad spec-
trum of progressive issues from 
Stock well's presentation on 
CIA-sponsored terrorism in 
Central American to a reflection 
on the student movement in the 
60's by former Students for a 
.Democratic Society (SOS) Pres-
ident Todd Gitlin. 

"Uniting for a Progressive 
Change" was the theme as stu-
dents from San Diego to 
Washington state came together 
and adopted resolutions sup-
porting the homeless, a nuclear 
test ban, and other issues. Most 
ofthe networking on these issues 
took place in caucuses, in which 
participants exchanged phone 
numbers and discussed possible 
united actions. 

This conference took place in 
the general context of a rise in 
activity in the United States and 
international student movement. 
Many of those present in the' 
networking caucus had been 
present at a huge progressive 
student conference at New Jer-
sey's Rutgers University the pre-
vious weekend . Also, two repre-

sentatives of the Progressive 
Student Network (PSN), a lar-
gely Midwest organization, came 
from Chicago. 

Apparently no single issue has 
yet galvanized the student 
movement the way the Vietnam 
War and the civil rights struggles 
did in the 196Os. Most attending 
student activists, however, were 
most concerned with Central 
America, anti-CIA, and anti-ra-
cist issues, which seemed to strike 
'a sympathetic chord in most 
students. 

In a panel discussion on anti-
CIA demonstrations , Jamie 
Acton, a UC Santa Barbara stu-
dent, described the current efforts 
at that campus to drive a CIA 
agent away who was working at 
the university as a visiting pro-
fessor. The agent started teach-
ing but was later removed, ap-
parently as a result of the pro-
tests. Acton and others in his 
group are collaborating with 
John Stockwell to develop a 
national awareness of CIA infil-
tration of universities and the 
agency activities abroad . 

At the same discussion Stock-
well said that he understood the 
role of CIA presence on campus 
to be purely "public relation." 
He explained that the CIA gets 
hundreds more application~ than 
it needs, so the campus recruit-
ment is superfluous. Giving a 
brief scenario of CIA campus 
presentation, he indicated the 
visiting agents would try to leave 
the impression such that people 
will later think, "I met a CIA 
agent , he was a nice guy." 

The panel discussion in the 
history of student activism was 

also well attended. Carl David-
son, president from 1966-67 of 
Students for a Democratic So-
ciety, which was a national stu-
dent organization of the 60's 
and Todd Gitlin, SDS president 
from 1963-64, addressed the 
errors and insights of activism in 
the 60's. 

Gitlin said he thought one 
major problem was that people 
worked under the illusion that a 
revolution, or large-scale politi-
cal and social change, was about 
to occur, and when it didn 't they 
were disillusioned . Acknowledg-
ing the naivete of the 60's , 
Davidson also focused on the 
destructive actions of some left 
groups within the movement, 
mainly an organization called 
Progressive Labor. 

The stirrings of a national stu-
dent movement occur at a time 
of rising activism. Many of the 
conference attendees expressed 
their support for Third World 
organizations and the need to 
fight rising racism. This issue is 
an especially important one in 
Southern California because of 
its large chicano population, 
according to members of chi-
cano student group MEChA 
from Mira Costa college, near 
Oceanside. 

All of these projects fit into the 
general CA PSA principles adop-
ted at its inception last year in 
meetings held at UC Santll Bar-
bara, Berkeley and Davis. The 
organization is intended to be 
"both a communications and 1\n 
action-oriented network" accord-
ing to last year's resolutions. The 
next state-wide conference is 
tentatively scheduled for next 
year at USc. (QJ

Steven Jay Gould 
will lecture 

Stephen Jay Gould, a lecturer and 
educator who, since 1982, has added 
19 honorary degrees to his credits, will 
speak Thursday, Feb. 18 at 8 pm in 
the Mandell Weiss Center for the Per-
forming Arts at UCSD. The lecture, 
sponsored by the UCSD's department 
of literature, is free. 

Gould. who teaches biology. geol-
ogy and the history of science at Har-
vard University, has recently published 
a bo k of essays called An Urchin in 
the Storm. Technically book reviews, 
these essays serve as a springboard for 
Gould's most popular causes: the 
defense of reason and the attack on 
biological determinism. 

A proponent of Darwinism, Gould 
writes a warning about creationism, 
saying that its exploiters and fundrais-
ers are "right-wing evangelicals who 
advance the literalism of Genesis as 
just one item in a comprehensive polit-
ical program that would also ban 
abortion and return old-fashioned 
patriarchy under the guise of saving 
American families ." 

The unusual biological traits of 
pandas occupy Gould's interest in one 
of the essays, as he discusses how an 
animal from the carnivora order man-
ages to thrive almost entirely on bam-
boo. "Evolution is the quintessential 
science of history, and the hold of his-
tory lies exposed in myriad imperfec-
tions and compromises (panda's 
thumbs) featured by all organisms as 
legacies of their different pasts ... , .. he 
writes. (Gould has written on pandas 
in a book called The Panda s Thumb. 

Since 1982. Gould has been the 
Alexander Agassiz Professor of Zool-
ogy at Harvard. He began teaching at 
Harvard in 1967, immediately after 
receiving his doctorate from Columbia 
University, and in 1973 he was named 
professor of geology, and curator of 
invertebrate paleontology for the 
Museum of Comparative Zoology.

CAPSA 
Farm workers' leader speaks 
out against grape growers 

By ANDREA KOHN 
specilll /rolll tll~ Sttuiford DtlUy 

The Chicano and Latino 
farmworkers in the United State:s 
must endure both poverty and 
deplorable working conditions, 
the national vice president of the 
United Farm Worker's associa-
tion said in a speech last Satur-
day at Stanford University. 

Dolores Huerta, participating 
in the second annual conference 
of the California Alliance of 
Progressive Student Activists 
(CAPSA), attributed the prob-
lems of the workers to several 
factors. 

One problem, according to 
Huerta, is the "low wages farm 
workers receive." Workers now 
earn $3.30 per hour, she said, 
charging that the wage is causing 
an increase in the number of 
Chicanos and Latinos who live 
below the poverty level. 

used agricultural pesticides. 
Blasting the policy, Huerta 

called it "a slave labor program. 
The growers can keep bringing 
in new workers who do not know 
of the problems with the 

pesticides ... 
Huerta alleged that many of 

these pesticides cause cancer 
among workers on grape farms 
and contaminate agricultural

Another problem is a 
government labor problem that 
allows grape growers to bring 
workers from Latin American 
countries into the United States 
on a temporary basis. Huerta 
said many of these temporary 
workers who are in the United 
States for less than a year do not 
understand the dangers of work-

tempted to describe the CIA 
operations in Nicaragua, based 
on his similar experiences in 
Angola. 

Stockwell charged that these 
operations aim at destabilizing 
Nicaragua's economy by block-
ing the peasants from getting 
their produce into the market, 
burning down grainaries, and 
paralyzing the railroad and other 
means of transportation. 

Former CIA atrocities, which 

Stockwell alleged are character-
istic of the agency's posture 
towards Third World countries, 
include instances of gratuitous 
rape and castration in front of 
Nicaraguan children. 

Stockwell warned the audience 
about what he said are the many 
ways that the CIA is making the 
world less stable. From 1961 to 
1975, a 14-year period, the CIA 
executed 900 major covert oper-
ations, and several thousand 
minor ones, Stockwell said, 
including assassinations of heads

In addition,the CIA used drug

In conclusion, Stockwell urged 
students to oppose the CIA. He 
said CIA propaganda has per-
meated society to the extent that 

. it is now part of the news media. 
The New York Times and the 
Washington Post. he claims, are 
closely affiliated with the CIA.

Noted poet, playwright ("Outchman and the slave") and 
literary scholar Amiri Baraka (formerly Leroi Jones) gave a 
highly charged poetry reading last Thursday as part of the 
celebration of Black History Month. After an introduction by 
UCSO literature professor Shirley Williams, Baraka read from 
his book, "The Music - Reflections on Jau and Blues." 

The influence of music on Baraka (who also wrote "Blues 
People" a history of rhythm and blues in America) was evident 
throughout the reading as he often sang his poetry a capella to 
the audience. Outspoken at times Baraka interjected his 
readings with political and cultural commentary that drew 
mixed response from his audience. But overall, Baraka re-
ceived more laughter than complaints and his musical inter-
pretation of his poetry added insight and warmth to the harsh 
yet heartfelt themes which united his works.

Hunter S. Thompson 
Saturday Night 

D ropped Maria off in front of t he tattoo parlor just befo re midnight. There wa no place to park on thc treet , so I sent her 
inside and found a place o n the idewalk , in fro nt of a house with no 
lights. 

We' had located the P ict ure Machine Tattoo Parlor in the Yellow 
Pages, o nly an hour before it closed. It was time to get the story. 

Fortunately, it was o nly a few blocks a way fro m the hote l, on the 
corner of T hird and Geary, in the same lonely d oorway as Su icide 
Prevent ion Inc. The whole front of the build ing was shrouded by 
thick steel accordion creens, like the o nes they have in Beirut. 

T he suicide cli nic was closed , but Maria ra ng the bell to the tattoo 
parlor and then disa ppeared inside. 

By the time I got the re, she was a lready sta ri ng d olefull y at a small 
whi te card from the Key and Cohn Dermatology Clinic. It sa id , 
"Tattoo Removals by Laser Surgery." prices a nd fees upo n request. 

Anot her card, which the tattoo ma n had give n her , said "D o not 
pick scab ... I will not be held res po nsible for a ny tattoo after you 
leave my premises. Thank you." 

T he proprietor was a giant Swiss named Mark, who e arms and shoulder looked like something out of a Fabulou Fu rry Freak 
Brothers cartoon. He had knives and snake and scorpions and skulls 
full of Hells Angels slogans: Live Fast, Die Hard ... Live to Ride, 
Ride to Kill . .. I ;o, hould Have Killed You Yesterday ... I'd Rather 
See My Sister in a Whorehouse Than ee My Brother on a Jap 
Bike .... 

"Eagles and panther," he aid , "Those are till the most pop-
ular ... . But , you see, ladies get more flower and tuff. The guys get 
the eagles and panther." 

The man seemed nervous . He had wanted to close by midnight , but 
now he saw shadows in his life . It is not good business, on the dark 
end of Geary Boulevard at two minutes to midnight on Saturday, to 
entertain two strangers with glittering eyes and no apparent motive. 

"We need something fast:' I told him . " I have a deadline at noon 
tomorrow. How long will it take to put a tattoo on thi woman?" 

He eyed me warily, then took another long look at Maria . " Where 
do you want itT' he asked . 

"Nevermind that ," I shouted. "We'll.put it on her back." I scanned 
the wall for a suitable design. but mo t of the good ones required too 
much time. Some took two or three minute, but others needed eight 
or 10 hours. 

Maria stretched out on the gurney and I pulled her sweater up, to 
expose both shoulder blades. The unhappy Swi~s took a long time 
clea ning his high-powered electric needle in a pan full of alcohol and 
ether. It hummed and whined like a huge dentist's drill, and then he 
plunged it into her f1esh. 

I am living in a penthouse uite in the Miya ko with wraparound balconies on the alleys and a deep ginzu bathtub, looking down on 
the rooftops of Japantown. I have egg rolls from room ervice and a 
new black Camaro in the hotel parking lot. 

They know me here. When I came back last night I saw the hotel 
bell captain tanding out in the middle of Po t treet in a sleazy black 
kimono, jabbering blankly at oncoming traffic. 

"Did you have fun?" asked the bell captain, as he opened the 
driver-side door for me . 

"Are you crazy"" I aid. " I have a serious dead line 10 meet. We've 
been at the tattoo parlor all night." 

"What?" he said . "You got yourself tattooed?" 
"Oh no," I told him. " A huge black and red panther between her 

shoulder blades ." 
H e nodded slowly, but I could not see that his face was te nse. "You 

made that poor girl get tattooed? Just for a newspaper sto ry?" 
"It was the right thing to do," I said . " We had no choice. We are, 

after all , professionals."

requirement tha t fu nding for seco nd-p hase unwilling ness to 
wo men 's a nd men's spo rts be see women as interchangeable 
equal. with men. Later, after heavy 

These two issues, together with 
a resistance to trea ting pregna ncy 
as just another normal "d isabil-
ity," revealed that while most 
America ns were will ing to ac-
kn wledge tha t women are equal 
10 men; only feminists in the late 
1970s were enthusiastic about a 
future in which in all matte rs of 
work , sport a nd pare nting, 
women would be interchangea-
ble with men . Abortion oppo-
nents claimed to be motivated 
onl y by religious beliefs about 
the sanctity of the fetu s. But , as 
Christa Lueker in her book, 
A bortion: The Politics of Moth-
erhood, .. confirms, men under-
stood quite a s well as women 
that " reproductive freedom " 
challenged the previous power 
arrangements around "repro-
du ctive control. " Feminists 
wanted to wrest control over 
their bodies from men: husbands, 
lovers, fathers, clergymen , doc-
tors and the state. 

On the face of it, the Title IX 
controversy was driven by the 
passions attached to varsity 
sports and their role in college 
and university solvency and tra-
dition . But in fact, the image of 
strona-bodies women learning 
both competition and teamwork 
on the playing fields posed an 
even greater threat. "The playing 
fields .. . are precisely the groom-
ing ground for leaders. Men fear, 
as Betty Harrigan has docu-
mented in her best-selling book, 
Games Mother Never Taught 
You, that when women learn 
those "games," they may some-
times win . 

T he pregnancy iss ue f irst 
appeared in a case that came 
before the S upreme Court. In 
Gilbert vs. General Elect ric, an 
employee of G .E. sued the co m-

lo bbying by feminis ts, supported 
by most othe r representatives of 
wo rki ng women, the Congress 
a me nded Title VII - the job 
d i cri mination Title of the 1964 
Civil Righ ts Act - to fo rce 
companies to cover ma tern ity. 
But it was c lear fro m th e a rgu-
ments in t he co urt a nd in the 
C ongress tha t the lead ership and 
p e rhaps a large minorit y of 
voters, still c herished the notion 
that while women might be 
legall y equal to men, their diffe r-
ences were still very real. 

Phase III issues I call those 
about which even feminists dis-
agree. Problems of pornography, 
for example, and the legal and 
moral complications of previ-
ously unimagined reproductive 
technologies , are just not simple 
or straightforward enough to 
c reate consensus, even among 
women deeply committed to 
doing what is best for women . 
Gloria Steinem and others have 
taken one position on porno-
graphy - ban it and punish the 
perpetrators - that other femi-
nists, fearful of the loss of free 
speech, cannot share. There are 
divisions within the feminist 
camp, too , on the question of the 
legal and moral rights of the nat-
ural mother of Baby M . Some 
feminists support the couple who 
had legally contracted and paid 
for the surrogate's maternity. 
Others see the issue as "womb-
renting," and extended form of 
prostitution. 

Similar di visions urround 
"comparable worth ." From one 
point of view, comparable worth 
is nothing more than the next 
step in a drive for truly equal pay 
for equal work . Opponents, 
however, worry that if traditional 
women 's jobs are artificiall y 

See WOMEN, page S 

Women 
Continued from pIce 4 
improved in pay and status -
regardless of market-place cues 
- then, occupational segrega-
tion by sex will be harder to 
eliminate . 

What are we to make of these 
divisions? Is it a sign that femi-
nism is losing its appeal to the 
majority of women? Or that the 
leadership is in disarray? I doubt 
it. Phase III issues are simply 
more complex and divisive than 
the initial list of injustices that 
need to be "righted" right away. 
The movement still appears to be 
very strong. Evidence is in the 
growing number of women in 
positions of power in politics 
and business and the growing 
acceptance by most younger 
Americans of the quality of 
women's work and their right to 
an equal share. (See the recently 
previewed 1980s version of Star 
Trek for a look at an integrated 
starship crew.) 

While the first two candidates 
for the most coveted public offi-
ces - Vice President and Presi-
dent ofthe U.S. - didn't "make 
it," that some women can even 
contemplate the Presidency is a 
most significant gain for women 
as a class. 

Finally, the Reagan adminis-
tration 's apparent inability to 
turn back the clock for middle 
class and working women des-
pite eight years in office (poor 
women have not fared as well , 
owing to cuts in domestic pro-
grams) suggest that Americans 
have accepted a certain threshold 
of women's rights below which 
they are not willing to go. Take 
away any of those now funda-
mental expectations - equal 
access to jobs and benefits, equal 
credit , reproductive freedom, 
equal admissions to higher learn-
ing, protection from harassment 
even in the military - and we 
will see a revival of feminist con-
sensus and an intensity of femi-
nist protest on the streets, in the 
workplace and at the polls.

Huerta 
speaks 

When workers protested the 
accident, they were locked Ollt of 
their jobs, Huerta alleged . 
According to Huerta, the ranch 
was fined "only fifty dollars" for 
the incident. 

Laser beams pick up cells 
Continued from pace J 
town's drinking water. Huerta 
claimed that because of such pes-
ticides, agricultural work is now 
the second most dangerous 
occupation in the United States. 
She said there may have been 
thousands of reported incidents 
of pesticide-related health prob-
lems among farm workers. 

"Those are just the reported 
incidents," she said, adding that 
"it is probably only half of what 
it really is." Huerta related one 
recent case in which 52 workers 
were poisoned at H.P . Metzler 
ranch near Del Rey, California, 
a grape farm owned by Metro-
politan Life Insurance company. 

Huerta claimed that only 46 of 
the millions of bunches of grapes 
shipped every year from Cali-
fornia are tested for pesticides . 
She maintained that the equip-
ment that is used to perform the 
tests does not necessarily check 
for the harmful pesticides. 

Huerta said that such pesti-
cide residues, which sometimes 
remain after washing, have been 
found on randomly tested grapes. 
Despite the dangers associated 
with carcinogenic pesticides, 
Huerta said their use is not 
illegal. 

"We can't even say that it's 
illegal use of pesticides,;' she said. 
"The pesticides are legal, but 
they are know carcinogens." IQ) 

LOS ALAMOS, N.M. -
Using laser beams as if they were 
microscopic tongs, Tudor Bui-
can can pick up individual live 
cells less than one-thousandth of 
an inch thick. 

Buican, a biophysicist in Los 
Alamos Nalional La bora tory's 
Life Sciences Division, is per-
fecting a cell manipulation tech-
nique that will be a boon to biol-
ogists, immunologists and others 
in biomedicine. 

Sorting and manipulating cells 
is a critical task in biomedicine, 
but current methods have disad-
vantages, Buican said. 

"Most cell-sorting techniques 
can only separate out groups of 
cells, rather than individual cells. 
The methods that handle indi-
vidual cells either don't position

them very accurately or involve 
relatively bulky mechanical 
devices," he said . 

When a mechanical device is 
used, the container must be open 
so the manipulator tip can get in. 
This exposes the ex pei"iment and 
experimenter to possible con-
tamination . 

. Buican's method uses one or 
two laser beams to pick up a cell. 
With the single-beam method, 
the laser traps the well within the 
beam. The cell will go wherever 
the beam is pointed , and when 
the laser's intensity is reduced , 
the cell drops off. It can be reco-
vered later. 

Using two laser beams, Buican 
traps the cell at the intersection 
of the beams. He then can move 

the cell in any direction, before 
setting it down. 

The Los Alamos experiments 
may be the first to use optical 
trapping for biomedical applica-
tions. Early research shows it has 
several major advantages over 
other methods. 

Among them is that ceil-mani-
pulation experiments using a 
laser can be done in a completely 
enclosed container as small as a 
finger nail. 

Another advantage to using 
lasers in cell experiments is the 
ability to move one cell at a time. 
It enables a scientist to attach 
two specific cells together, which 
is valuable in cellular research 
such as cancer and leukemia 
studies .

The high cost of student living 
What do you get for your dollar? 
By LISA QUINTANA 
St-n Writer 

W hat could be more con-venient than being able to sleep until 15 min-
utes before your cla s1 However, 
there are many disadvantages as 
well as advantages to living on-
campus, and the same holds true 
for living off-campus. 

For freshmen, the dorms on-
campus are ideal si nce it is usu-
ally the first time they have lived 
away from home. Dorms allow 
students to be independent -
students must do their own 
laundry and make sure they eat, 
and yet they do not have to 
worry about grocery shopping 
or paying utility bills. 

There is always a resident 
advisor (R.A.) informing and 
motivating students, and living 
in a house with people of similar 
situations, it is easy to meet 
people and make friends. There 
is even a maid service to keep the 
bathrooms and other common 
living ateas clean, and most stu-
dents do not worry about keep-
ing their doors locked . Mainte-
nance is on hand to correct 
plumbing and electrical problems 
as well . 

Students who opt to live in on-
campus apartments find that 
there is added responsibility from 
the dorms. Students must keep 
their residences and bathrooms 
clean, (at least during inspection 
week), and if they choose to 
forego the meal plan they must 
learn how to cook and they must 
have a means of transportation 
to buy food. However, students 
can still leave the lights on all 
night, set their thermostat at 80 
degrees, and invite all of their 
friends over for a shower. They 
do not have to worry about 
driving home after a sojourn in 
the Pub eilher. 

The d isadvantages are not as 
obvious unless you have actually 
lived on-campus and have expe-
rienced problems firsthand . One 
drawback is the cost. According 
to Larry Barrett at UCSD Hous-
ing and Food Administ rat ion, 
resident hall (dorm) inhabitants 
pay an average total rent of 
$4,600 per school year, including 
a 19 meal per week plan . For 
dorm residents a meal plan is 
mandatory, although they may 
opt for a 14 or 10 meal plan . A 
single room in the dorms costs 
an additional $200 per year. Of 
course, the meal plan is neces-

On-campus housing fac ilitates a social environment which 
students may miss living off-campus. 
sary because even though dorms 
contain a stove and other ap-
pliances in common living areas, 
it would be close to impossible to 
fix three meals a day in these 
"kitchens. " 

For undergraduate apartment 
residents, the average cost is 
$2,600 without a meal plan, and 

rather to pay for the buildings 
already in existence. 

dorms' mortgage. 
The payments also include a 

special reserve to be used in cases 
of emergencies or repairs . In the 
case of the Muir dining com-
mons, which needed new floor-
ing, the funding for the repairs 
came from their special reserve; 
student housing had no part in 
the project. All mortgage pay-
ments are paid from profits gar-
nered by the Muir dining com-
ons itself and from meal card 
funds. When you pay 25¢ for a 
piece of cheese at the Rathskellar 
you can be assured that your 
money not only pays for the 
cheese and the employee who 
served it to you, but also pays for 
the building. 

The remainder of student pay-
ments go toward paying main-
tenance workers , gardeners and 
other necessities. Barrett said, 
"This is a straight-line operation. 
There are no profits." 

The rate of rent increase 
depends upon exactly how much 
the administration figures these 
expenditures will increase the 
next year, usually between 8 and 
10 percent. So when students 
leave the stereo on all day and 
take half-hour showers, they do 
pay for it in the end. 

--------------------------, a single room is also $200 more 

The $31 million Third College 
dorms and Third dining com-
mons currently under construc-
tion are typical examples. Bar-
rett stressed that "there is no 
state or federal funding," and the 
university had to find someone One added cost of living on-

per year. Therefore, students in 
the dorms pay an average of 
$511 per month, and students in 
the dorms pay an only $289. 

Barrell said that all of the 
money students pay goes directly 
to housing expenses. Between 
seven and eight percent goes to 
utilities, and less than 20 percent 
goes toward mortgage payments, 
which extend for 40 years. No

ing can be difficult. It can be very 
difficult to study or sleep in your 
room Friday night due to the 
noise. Warren senior Ron Nak-
ada, who lived both in the 
Warren apartments and the Re-
velle resident halls, said, "There's 
more excitement, more things to 
do , but no place to get away 
from it all [on campus)." 

To some, the biggest draw-
back of living on-campus is the 
alcohol policy. Students over 21 
may only drink alcoholic bever-
ages in the privacy of their own 
homes or at univerSity events 
where alcohol is permitted. and 
kegs are strictly forbidden. In

versity enforces th is poli cy 
severely. 

There are other complaints 
a bout on-campus living. Ca ppy 
Sugawara, a Muir sophomore, 
said, "Our plumbing broke and 
flooded our living room. Main-
tenance fixed it , but our heater 
doesn't work, and t hey said there 
was nothing they could do." 

Last year as a recruitment tool, 
all of the UCSD colleges initiated 
a two-yea r guaranteed housing 
plan for freshmen and transfer 
student s, which edges out most 
upperclassmen from on-campus 
living. Revelle junior Karen Bal-
lard complained, "They just 
alienated us ." Students were 
forced to become completely 
independent , and the man y 
drawbacks of livi ng off-campus 
beca me even more apparent. 

On-campus living, however, 
also has its st rong points. The 

Maintenance costs. if any, are 
generally taken ca re of by land-
lords, depending on where the 
fault lies. 

Kec;' in mind tflat the figure 
for off-campus housing is for a 
si ngle room in a beach area . To 
share a room near the beach 
area averages $225 plus utilities, 
and the further you move away 
from the beach the cheaper 
housing becomes. In the eastern 
areas, a single room averages 
$280, and to share a room rent is 
around $150 to $200. 

If yo u are trying to find inex-
pensive housing, University City 
and Claire mont may be good 
locations, but University City i 
the first place UCSD staff and 
students look , and this drives the 
rents up and makes housi ng 
sca rce. Clairemont is between 
five and ten miles away, so you 
must either get a car or rely on 
public transportation . In fact, 
unless you want to ride on the 
bus for hours, you need a car to 
get anywhere off-campus. This 
becomes very expensive over 
time. 

The disadvantages to li vi ng 

In addition. students must each 
day plan extra time to drive to 
school , find a parking space, and 
walk to class . Add to these 
expenses the amount of money 
to pay parking tickets . which are 
almost impossible not to gel. 

Given the advantages and dis-
adva ntages of living on- or off-
ca mpus, the cosl of living turns 
out fair ly eve n in the end . The 
money you saved on off-campus 
rent goes into transportation . 

Junior Beth Ca mpbell . an off-
ca mpus resident , said , "You can 
go home and nol have to think 
about school anymore." Junior 
Karen Kawasaki added, " I have 
my ow n place to park near my 
house, and I don't ha ve to listen 
to drummers downstai rs. I like 
the freedom . We don't have to 
behave ourselves, and we don't 
have to follow any rules." 

Some students find the free-
dom of off-campus living ex hi-
larating; others feel it st ressful. 
Eve ntually, however, all students 
must leave the convenient co n-
fines of the Unive rsi ty and 
become a part of the so-called 
rea l world . lm 

The on-campus housing plan gives students a choice of 10, 14, or 19 meals per week but most soon 
tire of the limited fare. 

average student li ving on-campus 
may not realize that $289 is a 
high price to pay to share a 
room, eve n ifit does include util-
ities, maintenance and a poss ible 
ocean view. According to off-
ca mpus housing statistics, off-
campus st udents who live in the 
beac h areas pay an average of 
$300 for their own room with 
perhaps as much as $50 for utili-
ties. Ofte n , howeve r, these 
apartments a re unfurni shed . 

on-ca mpus tend to be the advan-
tages of living off-campus. but 
these pluses can be problems in 
disguise. There is no alcohol pol-
icy, but there is still the " real " 
law. On-campus , the university 
police tend to be more lenient 
than the San Diego Police. There 
may be peace and quiet, but 
there may also be Friday nights 
spent watching " Dallas" because 
word about the TG did not spread 
off-campus.

Looking for a conference championship 
Ski team hits slopes with 
three straight wins 

By JEFF LAMBETH 

With a late-season surge, the 
UCSD ski team is closing in on a 
Southern California Collegiate 
Ski Conference title . 

That's hardly surprising to the 
rest of the conference. 

The team, which is currently 
second in the conference behind 
UC Santa Barbara, has won the 
last three championships. 

And with more performances 
like they had last weekend at 
Mammoth ski resort , they'll 
likely make that number four. 

place. 
Ironically. even though the 

Tritons didn't win the overall 
title Sunday, the race saw the 
Tritons' two top individual per-
formances . James Heitzler was 
third in Sunday's slalom, while 
Madeline Schneider was sixth 
among the women. 

On Monday, the race was a 
giant slalom. The men's team 
was again second and the women 
took fourth . This tied them for 
first place all-around . 

The Tritons raced six women 
and 15 men at the Mammoth 

"We're doing great right now. We're in 
second place and closing on UCSB. We're 
greedy." 

" We're doing great right now," 
said Triton Coach Nick Nedd . 
"We're in second place and clos-
ing in on UCSB. We're greedy. 
We want another conference 
title. " 

The Tritons won two of the 
three races at Mammoth, and

Tritons lose to USAF&CSUB 
By MIKE U'REN 
St,qJ Writer 

This past weekend the UCSD 
men's tennis team took on Di-
vision 1 school Air Force and 
Division II powerhouse Cal State 
Bakersfield. The Tritons dropped 
both matches by identical scores 
of 7-2. 7-2. 

After dropping their first four 
singles matches on Sunday 

against Air Force, senior Kyle 
Knapp, playing in fifth spot, 
defeated his opponent 6-7, 6-4, 
6-2 and teammate John Park fol-
lowed by making quiCk work of 
his foe 6-4, 6-4. Down 4-2, the 
Tritons still had a chance to win 
the match but after winning the 
first set in each of the three dou-
bles matches, all three doubles 
teams folded in the third and 
deciding sets. 

The Tritons had little time to 
rest after Sunday's loss, having 
to take on top 10 Division II 
school Cal State Bakersfield the 
following day. The Tritons man-
aged to capture only two singles 
matches throughout the day. 
Number two seed, Sig Huber, 
won 7-6, 6-4 and Frank, playing 
in the number four spot, defeated 
his opponent 7-5, 3-6, 7-5 to give 
the Tritons their second victory.

Although top seed Hunter 
Gallaway failed to win either of 
his matches this past weekend, 
he did manage to pull off a major 
upset Friday at a l6-team tour-
nament in which UCSD partici-
pated. Gallaway defeated the 
No.4 seed in the tournament, 
Mike Giusto. Guisto, who plays 
for Cal Poly, and is currently 
ranked second in the nation 
among Division II schools, had 
earlier in the season beaten Stan-
ford's top seed and Long Beach 
State's No. I setd . Stanford is 
currently ra nked No. I in the 
nation. About the victory, Long 
Beach State coach said, "It was 
an amazing victory for Galla-
way. I was impressed!" 

The Tritons are now 3-5 on the 
season, but four of the losses 
were to Division I schools and 
the other was to a top ranked 
Division II school. The Tritons 
have yet to playa Division III 
university and their tough pre-
season competition should weigh 
heavily in t he Tritons favor when 
tournament time rolls around. 

Coach Hammermeister con-
cluded by saying, "Our 3-5 record 
will not affect us at all . We still 
have about eight or nine Division 
III schools remaining in our sche-
dule and the chances of our team 
making the tournament in my 
opinion are very good." 

Ten teams will participate in 
the Division III National Tour-
nament and the Tritons are 
currently ranked No. 9. (Q)

IUDMAN'S IASKETIALI. ounooK 
As the regular season begins to wind 

down, many teams will begin that final 
push to get themselves into the playoffs. 
For the teams with .500 records. their 
next game or two will determine whether 
or not they participate in postseason 
play. It IS time to buckle down the chin 
strap, dig in and make a move. For the 
elite teams that have been cruIsing 
through their leagues it is a time to 
sharpen up the fast break, test a new 
zone defense and also try to maintain a 
sharp edge. Here is a look at what faces 
the top contenders through the rest of 
league play. 

MEN'S AAA 
Iornyard EHqu .... has two games 

left against teams with losing records. 
Vacheron, Wilson, Manson and com-
pany can't let up though as both of their 
opponents have outside playoff chances 
and are very scrappy Herd·.lost 
RouncHIp blew through their league 
and was never really tested, which may 
hurt them I~ the playoffs. Triton Pub Wi ll 
host Probl.m Shooter, on Sunday at 
7'00 in a game that could determine 
second place Pub rebounded from a 
loss to Barnyard with a 34-polnt VictOry 
In their last outing The Shooters have 
won three In a row after a rocky start 
and would love to upset the defending 
champs 

MEN'S AA 
In this d ivIsion there are several 

upcoming games that match top ranked 
squads. The number one ranked Nlke', 
Dream Team Will square off with No. 4 
Flying Galdoblnl • . This tilt figures to be 
a test of speed against Size The Dream 
Team has more backcourt speed than 
anyone. They Will fast break on every 
occasion and will press full court all 
game long On the other Side Galdablnis 
features some reall",debodles Inside 
and Will always outrebound opponents. 
Tipoff IS at 9.15 on Thur Feb. 25 On 
Wed Feb 24 at 10:15 the Nos 3 and 6 
teams Will meet Phi $lappa Ioc:ka 
Ioardo (3rd) has been crushing oppo-
nents by an average of 20 po,nls per 
outing The veteran SUperwoles. 
Plankton (6th) crew bowed oul of the 
playofs early last year and IS determined 
to bring home the gold Ihls lime around 
The Jayhawk league Will fealure a solid 
malchup the last game of the regular 
season. NO. 2-ranked DIsc:lpI .. 01 
James Wi ll host Small T-., to decide 
Ihe league championship. My Dinner 
With Raoul Will get a chance al the 
Runnin ' rebel league tille when they face 
In The Hole on March 3 at f 1 00 Bern-
"eln's R.vtslted and Slow a Ugly 
should have no trouble With the rest of 
Ihelr schedules 10 round oullhe lOp len. 

MEN'S A 
Here we find more lop ranked mat-

chups thaI shOuld draw huge crowds 
No. 2 Too Small will meet No. 4 Norm 
Buntz Society Ihis Sunday al 1 :00. This 
game Will pit aggressive high scoring ptay 
play from Too Small againsl the more 
experienced, conserval,ve slow-down 
game of Society (olherwise known as 
youth vs. age) . No. a-ranked Beag .... 
Bouncing loll, square off th is Sunday 
at 9 '00 p.m with The Kr.m in a game 
that could decide the Blue Devil league 
championship. The Boilermaker league 
should go down to Ihe lasl week before 
a champion is crowned ThaI IS when 
No 4-ranked Llpo SUction will meet 
ChapoqulllelL Others In the top ten 
should have the lough part of their 
schedules behind them. 

• MEN'S 5-/0 This diVision is very much like the 
NBA We have IWO maybe Ihree teams 
who are head and shoulders above the 
rest of the competition. Last year's 
champs Killer I'ygml .. : Death Grip 
have made easy work of opponenls in 
the BrUin league. and should have no 
trouble wllh their remaining dales. Su.hl 
In Your Foce has marched through Ihe 
TroJan league v,lth competition coming 
only from Samba PItch. They squared 
off last night and scores were not avail -
a ble a s of press time Deoctly Shooter. 
IS a squad that has Pygmies and Sushi 
In their Sights and can 't walt until the 
playoffs. They have so far had little with 
opponents in league play 

COED 
As we look Ihrough the coed league 

schedules it becomes very clear that 
each league has one dominant team. 
Running The Hoop, Triton Pub, High 
Beams a StIck Shills and In Search 
01 . . . The Hoop have all been strolling 
through league play. The Gaucho 
league promised to produce a solid 
matchup when Win Another For FUll 
tipped off against The Herd And TheIr 
Mot ... That game flzzted though when 
the Herd didn't show up 

WOMEN'S 
Both the Crimson Tide and 4ger 

leagues have finished play, Phi S!ammo 
Jomma II will lead a wide open field Inlo 
the playoffs Other squads Ihal coutd 
easily be Involved in Ihe championship 
game ar VII, JUII A Hobby. 1-8011 
Again, Pumphouse Gong and PI Phi.

PUMP HOUSE GANG - Women's A Bask ...... 
This week, the Bud Team of the Week honors go to The 

Pump House G ...... They pulled off a 40-38 squeaker to 
bring their record to 3-1 on the season. 

The majority of the scoring was done by three agressive 
women: Christine Roos, Mary Plumb and Lauren Joyce. These 
players were at both ends of the Roor all night, playing with the 
intensity that it took to win. With some futile attempts at 
regaining the lead, the game was decided by two missed free 
throws. The exdtement was seen throughout the Fan. 

The only game this team lost all season was by a single 
basket, so look for them in a possible upset for the title. 
Congratulations ladies, This Bud's For Youl 

In 1981. in a small town in 
the southwest corner of New 
York called Jamestown. six 
young musicians banned to-
gether to form a group that 
they hoped would one day 
play an important role in the 
musical community. After 
seven years of constant tour-
ing, three full albums. and the 
loss of a key member of the 
band. 10,000 Maniacs is fin-
ally realizing that goal. As 
UCSD prepares to play host 
to the band on Saturday night. 
Feb. 20, when they open for 
Squeeze. there are still those 
who are unfamiliar with the 
music and the history of 
10,000 Maniacs. 

Growing up in a community 
that had little to offer in the 
way of musical influences, the 
Maniacs were forced to create 
their own style. Choosing a 
name that symbolized the 
musical era rather than their 
own more subdued style. 
10.000 Maniacs was formed 
by 16-year-old Natalie Mer-
chant and guitarist John Lom-
bardo, who enlisted the talents 
of Dennis Drew on keyboards. 
Steve Gustafson on bass. 

-T.-p·ib:e of Maniac-s \ tn" If 
Robert Buck on guitar. and 
drummer Jerry Augustyniak. 

Reflecting on the early days, 
keyboardist Drew recalls. "In 
Jamestown there was never 
any music community for us 
to become a part of or to be 
influenced by. so we were able 
to develop in a vacuum and 
come out sounding like 
ourselves_" 

Initially the Maniacs special-
ized in covers of innovative 
English bands like Joy Division 
and Gang of Four. Eventually, 
the band began writing their 
own material. incorporating 
folk. country. and bluegrass 
with their British and Carib-
bean influences. Armed with 
their music and the will to be 
heard, 10.000 Maniacs spent 
their first year touring the 
New York area playing clubs 
and benefits constantly. 

1t was at this time that the 
band recorded their first com-
pilation of tunes in the form 
of a five song EP called. 
"Human Conflict Number 
Five." Recorded on their own 
Christian Burial label. the EP 
featured their first original 
songs. Following this. they 

by I~rry weintraub 
hiatul writer 

acquired an old school bus 
and proceeded to tour the 
eastern United States and 
Canada. 

Having logged an incredible 
amount of miles and appear-
ances, 10.000 Maniacs entered 
the studio Once again to record 
their first full length album. 
The result , a ten-song set 
entitled. "Secrets of the I 
Ching" recorded for $500. 
again on their own label. 
received high critical praise. 
The album found its way onto 
British radio where deejay 
John Peel propelled it into a 
cult favorite. Their first single. 
"My Mother the War" was 
the only American song to 
finish in the top SO on the 
BBC year-end Iistener's polJ 
of 1983. 

The next year was spent 
touring Europe and the United 
States. which resulted in the 
signing of a recording contract 
with Elektra records. For Elek-
era. the band recorded "The 
Wishing Chair" in London . 
Produced by John Boyd whose 
credits include R.E,M. and 
the "Clockwork Orange" 
soundtrack, the album ended 

up as one of 1985 's most 
critica lly-acclaimed releases_ 

Though the band had re-
cei ved a large amount of 
critical success. they still had 
not gained significant public 
support. 1t was because of this 
that co-founder and chief 
songwriter John Lombardo left 
the band. As a result. the 
remaining band members were 
not only forced to contribute 
to the new album. they also 
had to learn to play with four 
instruments instead of five. 

With the aid of producer 
Peter Asher , known for his 
work as the driving force 
behind the success of Linda 
Ronstadt and James Taylor. 
the quintet churned out their 
most recent release. "In My 
Tribe ." Combining their 
trademark style with a new 
more accessible sound, "In 
My Tribe" has been heralded 
as one of the year's best albums 
by critics and fans alike. The 
album's content ranges from 
the child-abuse lament of 
"What's the Matter Here" 
through the personal illustra-
tions of "Don't Talk" and 

then to the symphonic " Verdi 
Cries." Blending harmonious 
mel odies with Natalie 
Merchant's poetic and nar-
rative lyrics. "1n My Tribe" is 
destined to finally gain 10.000 
Maniacs the attention they 
deserve . 

Supporting the new album. 
10.000 Maniacs has been en-
gaged in an endless touring 
schedule which includes their 
stop at the UCSD gym Satur-
day night. Opening for bands 
such as REM and Squeeze 
across the country has given 
thousands of fans the chance 
to experience the theatrics fo r 
which Natalie and the Maniacs 
have gained a reputation . 

If you haven't heard 10.000 
Maniacs. now is your chance. 
supporting an album as fan-
tastic as "In My Tribe." the 
band is destined to become 
one of American music's big-
gest success stories. 10.000 
Maniacs has finally realized 
the perfect combination to 
making enjoyable and impres-
sionable music that leaves you 
knowing that their best is yet 
to come.

Quarter 
notes 

by nigel Iindemann 
hiatu5 writer 

The Alban Berg Quartet, 
which was founded in 1970 
by four young professors at 
the Vienna Academy of Music, 
and which today ranks among 
the finest string quartets in the 
world, will play an ail-Beet-
hoven program Friday, Feb. 

19 at 8 pm in the Mandeville 
Center. 

Named for one of the lead-
ing composers of the second 
Viennese School, the quartet 
has been likened to its name-
sake in terms of its roman-
ticism and drama, and has 
been hailed by critics as "felici-
tous" and "impassioned ." 
One reviewer writes: "They 
dig forcefully into their in-
struments, using lots of vi-
brato, and producing a big, 
robust sound. Theirs is real 
meat and potatoes playing." 

Busy as it is, the quartet has

Blood 
lines 

by nancy muntner 
hiatus writer 

Over the past few years. the 
public has learned about a 
deadly disease which some 
claim may kill at least a quar-
ter of the world's population 
if it is not stopped. The dis-
ease is AIDS and television 
and newspapers have been 
instrumental in bringing the 
crisis to our consciousness. 
Now this issue is faced in the 
theatre as well . Janet Schech-
ter Tiger's new play, "Trans-
fusion," is scheduled for a 
world premiere gala on Feb. 
19 at the Lyceum. 

"Transfusion" involves a 
family of three in a small mid-
western town. John Sander-
son, a man with old-fashioned 
beliefs such as women should 
stay at home and that real men 
join the army, is dying of 
cancer. He lives with his grown 
daughter, Mary, who has been 
running the household since 
her mother's death. And he 
has a son, David. Ever since 
David admitted his homosex-
uality, moved to San Fran-
cisco, and changed his name 
to Elliott, his father has re-
fused to talk to him. 

We learn early on thatJohn 
needs a transfusion to save his 

life, and Elliott is the only 
other family member with his 
rare blood type. As this is a 
play about AIDS, you pro-
bably can gue.ss the impli-
cations of a homosexual giv-
ing blood to his father before 
being tested for the disease. 

The first act of the play 
takes place in 1978, the second 
in 1982 . In this way the 
audience can see the reactions 
of the family to the sudden 
AIDS epidemic that began in 
the early '80s. The play faces 
all of the myths about AIDS, 
explains that you cannot con-
tract it through touch, and 
that the disease is not I punish-
ment from God to homo-
sexuals. The audience also gets 
to hear Elliott's perspective as 
the one with the disease. He 
points out how ironic it is that 
the public is scared of catching 
his disease, when in actuality 
he 's the one with the reason to 
fear; anyone else's simple flu 
germ could kill him. 

All in all, the play gives an 
interesting view of AIDS, and 
attending the premiere will 
help a good cause;' the pro-
ceeds will be used to help with 
the cost of the 1988 "San 
Diego Walks for Life" benefit, 
which will in turn give money 
to agencies which support 
AIDS victims. . 

The premiere gala will be 
held at the Lyceum Stage in 
Horton Plaza on Feb. 19, at 8 
pm. Tickets cost $22.50 in 
advance or $25 the day of the 
performance. 

Gypsy's conflict 
by charles dU8ton 

hiatu. writer 

In "Brazo Gitano" (Gypsy 's 
Arm), graduate student and 
playwright, Caridad Svich 
shows a vision of Cuban youth 
in Miami. In her third year 
master's thesis, Svich explores 
her own heritage in a work 
that is a tale of the struggles 
between generations. Acting 

out the spiritual and physical 
rituals of their lives, the young 
C uban-Americans are torn 
between their parents' old 
ways and the new American 
culture that surrounds them. 

The play incorporates music 
and dance. Catholic and voo-
doo ritual , fantasy and poetry. 
It is performed in English and 
Spanish, and will be shown at 
UCSD's Warren Theatre 

Regina Byrd Smith stars with Patrick Miller as Luishi and Henry Conesa in 
"Brazo Gitano," a play wh ich combines wodooism and Catholicism. 

through Sunday Feb. 21. As 
the subject matter deals with 
adult situations, attendance by 
children is not recommended. 

Svich has compared her 
work to ancient Greek thea-
tre, which began as a ritual to 
the god Dionysus. She says 
that such art originally 
"blurred the distinction 
between spectator and actor 
. .. the participant became a 
spectator, an onlooker of 
events enacted." 

Much of the cast and pro-
duction staff is made up of 
UCSD theatre graduate stu-
dents. Patricia Pretzinger di-
rects . Sets and lighting are 
designed by J. Michael Griggs, 
with costumes by Lori Catlin 
and sound by Stephen P. Erb. 
The cast is comprised of 
Danny Burstein, Giovanni 
Felicioni, Patrick Miller, Reg-
ina Byrd Smith, Sean White-
sell, Karen June Sanchez, 
Michael Lopez, Luzmaria 
Garcia, Michele Mosler and 
Morgan Forsey. 

Curtain is at 8 pm, Thurs-
day through Saturday, and 7 
pm on Sunday. Tickets are 
available at the UCSD Box 
Office, the Mandell Weiss 
Center. Box Office (4-7 pm 
Tuesday-Friday), Ticket-
master outlets, and ARTS TIX 
at the Spreckels Theatre. On 
performance nights tickets 
will also be sold at the Warren 
Theatre box office two hours 
prior to curtain . General 
admission is $7, students $5.

Barrel of ha's 
by mark kenney 

hiatus writer 

Something funny is going to 
happen at the Triton Pub this 
Monday. Maybe. 

UCSD's entrants in the U.S. 
College Comedy Competition 
will be attempting to convince 
audiences and judges that they 
are among the funniest co-
medians or comediennes in 
the country. They will all be 
considered for the finals at 
Daytona Beach, Florida, and, 

if nothing else, get a free 
T-shirt. 

Sponsored by Stick lets Gum 
and Doritos Tortilla Chips, 
who, to understate the case, 
make no effort to keep their 
involvement secret (free gum 
and chips will be given out at 
the concert), the competition 
offers its winner a chance to 
perform at the Comic Strip in 
New York . The performances 
will be judged by professional 
comedians Larry "Bud" 
Melman and Gilbert Gottfried. 

Stand-up comedy is often 
considered one of the most 
difficult performances to give . 
This apparently does not 
dampen contestant's enthu-
siasm, with at least a half dozen 
expected to give their three 
minute acts on Monday, Feb. 
22. Overall , the sponsors claim 
that more than 2,000 entrants 
will participate on nearly 100 
campuses during the eight 
week competition. Of course, 
comedy can also be one of the 
most I ucrati ve professions; 
mega-stars such as Bill Cosby 
can receive over $250,000 for 
a single show. 

See LAUGHS, page 8 

Annex Art 
Two completely different art species 

are showing at UCSD's Annex Gallery 
this week. "Seen But Not Heard" is a 
mixed media collection by Gigi Clark . 

Clark utilizes video, photography and 
sound to form an autobiograhically 
linked show which depicts the frustra-
tions felt by the near-deaf artist . 

Jennifer L. Theisen's show, "Feline 
Fancy" is a study of various wild and 
domestic cats in oil and watercolor 
paintings. 

The show will run until this Friday.

Music Forum 
by shawn hanley 

hiatuf intern 

UCSD's New Music Forum 
begins the 1988 season this 
Thursday, Feb. 18, with the 
first of three free concerts in 
the Music '88 Festival. This 
festival will present works for 

instruments, tape and video, 
tape by the students and 
faculty o f UCSD's music 
department. All concerts in 
the festival begin at 8 pm in 
the Mandeville Recital Hall . 

Thursday'S concert features 
works for solo instruments, 
chamber groups and tape. The 

second concert, Tuesday, Feb. 
23, highlights a wide variety of 
chamber music . 

"The goal of the New Music 
Forum is to present as wide a 
range of music as possible," 
explains Frank Cox, one of 
the festival's organizers . To 
this extent, the festival will 
feature renowned performers 
from various cultural and 
musical backgrounds. These 
include soprano Carol Plan-

• large frozen yogurt and • American premieres of works 
by Japanese composer Joji 

Yuasa as well as two works by 
a new addition to the UCSD 
music faculty, the British 
composer Brian Ferneyhough. 

The Ne~ Music Forum 
began in 1974 as Atomicafe 
under the direction of Dr. 
Jean-Charles Francois. "We 
had to change the name be-
cause people confused us with 
the movie , or tho ught Atomi-
cafe was a place to eat," 
explained Cox. Although the 
,name has changed, the New 
Music Forum remains essen-
tially the same, a forum in 
which students can present 
their music . 

Quartet 
Continued from pale 2 
managed to put its interpretiw 
stamp on a lot of recordings 
through the years 

In Friday's concert, the 
quartet will play Beethoven's 
Quartet in G major, opus 18, 
number 2; his Quartet in F 
minor, opus 95; and the Quar-
tet number 15 in A minor, 
opus 132. Tickets are avail-
able at a substantial savings to 
UCSD students. For more
