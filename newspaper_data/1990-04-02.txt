UC Allocates $1.6 Million to 
Strengthen Galbraith Hall 
And Natatorium at UCSD 
By RANDY DOTINGA 
Senior StajfWriter 

The University of California has allo-
cated over $2 million to improve several 
earthquake-unsafe buildings at UCSD, in-
cluding Galbraith Hall and the Natatorium, 
as part of a $50 million UC-wide seismic 
correction program. 

UC President David Gardner requested 
the $50 million from the UC Regents last 
November to improve disaster prepared-
ness and make earthquake improvements 
throughout the PC system in the wake of the 
Oct. 17 Northern California earthquake. 

In January, the regents authorized the 
borrowing of the money from external 
sources to "promptly make improvements 
that could be accomplished without major 
structural renovation," according to infor-
mation provided by the Office of the Presi-
dent. 

The money to finance the loan will come 
from the UC Opportunity Fund, which is 

made up of "money we get as overhead for 
expenses from federal grants," according to 
Rick Malaspina, spokesman for the Office 
of the President. 

He added that the loan will be paid off in 
27 years at an estimated rate of $5 million 
per year. 

According to Malaspina, the money was 
borrowed because the UC has only received 
limited funding from the state for earth-
quake improvements in the past. 

"By borrowing the $50 million, we get a 
lot of the work done quickly on our own," 
Malaspina said. 

The October earthquake "underscored 
the need to move more quickly," he added. 

The specific allocation of the $50 million 
was announced last month. Approximately 
$37.5 million of the funding will go toward 
structural improvements to 16 state-sup-
ported UC buildings, including the Experi-
mental Aquarium at Scripps Institute of 
Oceanography and UCSD's Galbraith Hall 
and Natatorium. 

RIMAe Dissidents' Request Turned Down The other state-funded buildings to be renovated are Berkeley 's University Hall; 
Davis ' Sproul Hall; Irvine 's Crawford Han, 
Humanities Hall , and Humanitie office 
building bridge; Los Angeles' Moore Hall, 
Bunche Hall, Mathematical Sciences, and 
Public Health building ; Riverside 's Bell 
Tower, Physic Colonnade, and Public 
Safety Building, and Santa Barbara's Ch-
eadle Hall.

The latest attempt to nullify the RIMAC 
referendum re ults by student Andy How-
ard and others opposed to RIMAC has ap-
parently been unsuccessful. 

Howard recently sent a letter to Christo-
pher Cabal don, a consultant to the Califor-
nia State A sembly Subcommittee on Higher 
Education, requesting an investigation into 
the UCSD administration's activities re-
garding student fee-funded facilities. 

Howard chargeq that "from [RIMAC's] 
conception through the recent election, 
campus rules and guidelines concerning 
student fee-funded facilities were subverted, 
subjected to weird interpretations, changed 
retroactively, or ignored altogether by the 
administration." In the letter, Howard did 
not give any examples of these alleged 
actions. 

Director of Student Government Randy 
Woodard, Associate Vice Chancellor Tom 
Tucker,andA sociate Vice Chancellor A.W. 
Russ have all denied Howard's charges. 

The subcommittee, according to Cabal-
don, does not plan to conduct an investiga-
tion. 

"We don't have anything in the works ... 
we'd want to hear more about [RIMAC] 
from more people on the campus. But at this 
point we haven't decided to go forward with 
[an inve tigationJ," Cabal don aid. 

The letter mark the third attempt by a 
group led by Howard to overturn the ele -
tion re uh . 

The fir t attempt wa an elections viola-

tion complaint filed by student James Field 
with Woodard, who served as elections 
manager for the referendum. Field charged 
the RIMAC Committee with breaking 
campaign spending limits, failing to file a 
campaign financial report, and campaign-
ing within 50 feet of the polling places. 
Woodard said that the complaints were not 
valid becau e RIMAC wa a pecial refer-
endum. 

RIMAC opponents also filed an elec-
tions violation complaint with the A.S. 
Judicial Board, asking it to decide whether 
election rules were violated. The board 
denied the request, saying it was not in its 
jurisdiction. 

In late February, Howard said his plans 
were to nullify the election and to seek 
changes in state legislation to limit student 

fee-funded facilities. Legislation regarding 
student-levied fees has been proposed by 
Tom Hayden, chair of the Subcommittee on 
Higher Education. 

In his letter to Cabaldon, Howard sug-
gests that an investigation "could erve to 
inform the drafting of uch legislation, re-
sulting in a more effective bill." 

"We want to make sure that thi type of 
thing never happens again," Howard wrote 
in reference to what he described as the 
"hijacking" of tudent elections during the 
February interview. 

Howard said that even though Cabal don 
does not antici pate an investigation, Howard 
and others are asking other organizations, 
such as the UC Student Association, to in-
vestigate the administration's actions re-
garding the RIMAC special referendum. 

Approximately $5.8 million will be pent 
on non-structural improvement at all nine 
campu es, such as the ecuring of movable 
equipment and bracing equipment, book-
cases, and helve that may topple in a 
quake. 

In addition, approximately $6.7 million 
was allocated to improve the emergency 
systems at the UC San Francisco and UC 
Santa Cruz campuses, which were both 
damaged by the Oct. 17 earthquake.

Construction Communication Plan Developed 
By PHIL GRUEN 
Senior SlajfWriler 

A lack of communication between campus planning offices 
and the UCSD community concerning the construction of the 
Urey Hall addition last quarter prompted administrators to 
develop a "Communications Plan," intended to keep UCSD 
students, faculty, and staff informed of campus construction 
projects. 

The plan has already gone into effect, focusing on the up-
coming construction of the Central Library Addition. 

The plan, written by UCSD Director of Institutional Out-
reach Pat JaCoby and approved by the Department of Facilities, 
Design, and ConstT\lction, the University Communications Of-
fice, and the Planning Office, states that the "utmost effort is 

being made to keep all campus personnel informed, involved, and 
part of an exciting era." 

Recalling the outcry that followed the placement of a fence 
around Urey Lawn in late January before the campus community 
was effectively alened of the upcoming construction, Director of 
University Communications Winifred Cox said, "We've done a 
poor job of communicating to faculty, staff, and students." 

The addition to Central Library. which will add over 200,000 
square feet beneath the existing library space, is scheduled to 
begin in the next few weeks. However, before construction can 
begin, 246 eucalyptus trees win be removed, and "the project will 
create the biggest hole in the ground this campus has ever seen," 
according to the University Communications Office. 

Cox pointed outthat it is importantthatthe campus community

Forum Tonight Will Discuss Effects 
Of Abortion Issue on U.S. Politics 

"The New Politics of Abortion: Electoral Politics After 
Webster" will be the subject of the first in a serie of public 
policy forums to be held at UCSD this spring. This initial 
forum, which will feature a discussion panel of noted 
public opinion experts, will be held at 7:30 p.m. tonight in 
Ihe Price Center Theater. 

The panel discuss ion will feature Kathleen Francovic, 
a pollster and media commentator who serves as director 
of public opinion surveys and a producer for CBS News, 
and William Schneider, an author and political columnist. 

"This forum will not address the rights or wrongs of 
abortion," said Michael Rothschild, dean of UCSD's 
division of social sciences. "Our panel will examine how 
the abortion question has become an issue that is rapidly 
transforming electoral and party politics throughout the 
United States." 

The panel discussion, moderated by UCSD political 
science professor and polling expert Samuel Popkin, will 
explore the political implications of congressional and 
legislative involvement in abortion policy, as well as the 
current state of public opinion about these issues and how 
the Repu blican and Democratic parties are likely to grapple 
with it.

of the fall. the Alanleda County Coroner's office said. 
"A lot of people here at Barrington don' t trust the 

police." said Daniel Miller, a Barrington resident. "We've 
asked [Berkeley City Councilman Don Jelinek to request] 
that someone outside the police department investigate 
it." 

Mendoza's death occurred one week after a riol at the 
co-op that started when Berkeley police broke up a party 
there. Seventeen people were arrested. and more than 20 
people suffered injuries during the conflict. 

Berkeley police are still investigating the cause of his 
death and have not ruled out suicide. 

The coroner's office said it will know if Mendoza had 
any drugs in his system when the final toxicology report 
is finished early this month. 

But current and former Barrington residents who knew 
Mendoza said he showed no sign of wanting to take his 
own life. 

"Juan was not the type of guy that would have thrown 
himself off the roof." Miller recalled. Other friends indi-
cated that Mendoza was an avid rock climber who some-
times practiced by scaling the Barrington walls. 

Robert Maloney, the department' s homicide inspector, 
said Mendoza's death came from either slippingorjump-
ing off the building. 

'The wounds are consistent with falling from the build-
ing." Maloney said.

RENOVATION: Quake-Vulnerable UCSD 
Buildings Will Receive Funding From UC 

Jennifer Kolsky/Guardian 
A total of $1.44 miJlion will be used to make Galbraith Hall safer in the event of an earthquake. 
Continued from page 1 

All 16 UC buildings receiving 
renovation money were rated 
"poor" or "very poor" in a 1978 
engineering study of the earthq uake 
safety of UC buildings. A team of 
structural engineers, life-safety 
experts, and campus staffcommis-
sioned by UC President Gardner 
recently determined that the build-
ings would receive money from 
the $50 million fund. Malaspina 
said. 

"Poor" buildings were defined 
by the 1978 study as those whose 
perfonnance in a n earthquake 
would likely "result in significant 
structural and nonstructurai dam-
age and/or falling hazards that 
would represent appreciable life 
hazards." 

Buildings rated "very poor" 
would likely have "extensive struc-
tural and nonslructural damage, 
potential structural collapse. and/ 
or falling hazards that would rep-
resent high life hazards" inan eanh-
quake, the study stated. 

Buildings rated "good" or"fair" 
were those not expected to be seri-
ously damaged or to cause injury 
in an earthquake, according to the 
study. 

Ninety-five uncorrected UC 
buildings rated as " poor" or "very 
poor" in 1978 were not allocated 
renovation funding by the Board 
of Regents. 

The UC plans to lobby the state 
"more aggressively" than in the 
past for funding of $10 or $15 
million a year to pay for renova-
tion of these buildings, but even 
more money from the state will not 
pay for the improvement of all 
vulnerable buildings. Malaspina 
said. 

"We 're looking probably in 
excessof$500million if we wanted 
to address every need in every 
building in the [UC] ," hesaid. " But 
that's unrealistic . We' ve got to get 
as much as we can every year." 

Malas pina cautioned that stu-
dents should not be overly con-
cerned if they attend classes or 
work in buildings with rating of 
"poor" or "very poor." 

" It ' kind of an exaggerated 
rating. It doesn't mean a building 
is going to collapse and be totally 
ruined." Malaspina said. 

Of the $2.12 million total earth-
quake improvement allotment for 

UCSD, $1.44 million will go to 
add concrete bracing walls to Gal-
braith Hall. A sum of $150,000 
was allocated to add diagonal rod 
bracing to the walls of the Natato-
rium, and $40.000 will go to pro-
vide "enhanced structural connec-
tions between the roof and shear 
walls" at the Experimental Aquar-
ium at Scripps, according to Assis-
tant Vice Chancellor of Facil ities, 
Design, and Construction M. 
Boone Hellmann. 

The starting date of work on 
these renovations has not yet been 
scheduled, but Hellmann specu-
lated that "we might be able to start 
construction by late fall." 

He added that while the aquar-
ium and Natatorium renovations 
will have minimal affects on stu-
dents, the extensive Galbraith Hall 
work will "certainly" affect the 
operation of the building, to an as-
yet undetennined extent. 

A total of $475,000 was also 
allocated by the UC for non-struc-
tural improvements at UCSD. in-

eluding the reinforcementofbook-
cases and shelves, Hellmann said. 
This money will go toward the 
existing buildings at UCSD that 
received "poor" or "very poor" 
ratings in the 1978 study, he said. 

Some buildings considered 
earthquake-vulnerable in 1978 
have been renovated and are now 
considered safe. according 10 a 
1990 UCSD survey. These build-
ings include Argo Hall. Blake Hall. 
Revelle Commons East Wing, and 
Third College Commons. 

Other structures are currently 
being renovated or are scheduled 
for renovation, including Univer-
sity Hospital and the Medical 
Center boiler house. 

Several buildings considered 
vulnerable to earthquakes in 1978 
have been demolished or are sched-
uled to be destroyed. One structure 
slated for destruction is the USB 
interconnection bridge. 

According to Hellmann , a 
number of buildings will remain in

Richard Atkinson 

Poor Communication 
It took the Guardian four days just to talk. to Chancellor 

Richard Atkinson's secretary, and another couple of days before 
Atkinson called back. He did not, he said, want to do an interview. 
He wanted to "interact" for a few minutes. This apparently meant 
that he wanted to do whatever it took to get us to stop calling his 
office every day. 

This may not have been typical; it was Atkinson ' s last week in 
San Diego. He is now taking a two-month leave of absence to 
lobby in Washington for more federal funds for science and en-
gineering. But it was typical of what students think of Atkinson 
- when they think of him. He appears distant, unconcerned with 
students, and perhaps, some joke, doesn't exist at all. 

These impressions aren't necessarily accurate, but they dem-
onstrate a serious problem: Many students feel out of touch with 
the leadership of the Admini-
stration. A Feb. 25 Los Angeles 
Times story marking the 
chancellor's 100year anniver-
sary at UCSD prompted the 
calls to Atkinson. The story 
spoke glowingly of Atkinson's 
achievements in recruiting 
faculty and expanding UCSD, 
but it gave little attention to 
students. There were no quotes 
from students, and their con-
cerns were not mentioned . 
Clearly, Atkinson didn ' t write 
this article. However, the crite-

ria the article used to judge the Chance/lor Richard Atkinson 
chancellor were probably not 
far from those he uses to judge himself; Atkinson's priorities are 
not the priorities of undergraduates. 

Last year, a referendum appeared on the student body election 
ballot which read, " Do you feel that ChancelIor Atkinson has 
adequately administered the UCSD campus with the best inter-
ests ofUCSD Undergraduate Students in mind?" Sixty percent of 
the voting students voted " no," only nine percent "yes." 

This vote of no confidence demonstrated Atkinson's most se-
rious problem: his failure to communicate his goals to students, 
and to make those goals appealing to students. It might be argued 
that the chancellor's job should not include marketing, but that' s 
nonsense. That's exactly what the job is. But Atkinson has chosen 
to appeal to faculty and the academic community. This is proba-
bly a wise choice, from his standpoint. The vote of no confidence 
from students had little effect on Atkinson, but a faculty vote of 
no confidence ten years ago helped prompt the resignation of 
Atkinson's predecessor, William D. McElroy. 

Atkinson's skill at playing by the "rules of chancellor success" 
does not excuse him - those rules are wrong. Certainly recruit-
ment of faculty is important, and so is building new facilities. Re-
search also has a place, though Atkinson is not alone in giving it 
more importance than undergraduate education. These accom-
plishments do not change the reality that students face: a sense of 
estrangement from the administration, which constantly results 
in small issues becoming large ones - such as the co~p issue -
and a strong feeling that students are at the bottom of the pecking 
order at UCSD. 

That's not the way it should be. 1be UC system was created to 
educate students, not to create bureaucracies which try to per-
petuate themselves at all costs, and not to become barren research 
institutions. Atkinson has apparently failed to develop a coherent 
vision of how UCSD can better serve undergraduates, and if he 
does have s uch a vision, he has tragically failed to communicate 
iL 

Atkinson will be in Washington for two months. No student is 
likely to notice, or care. That's testament to the depth of the gap 
between students and the chancellor. 

Koala Article Does Not Promote Sexism 
Editor: 

In response to Lisa Rosen' s 
letter to the editor in the recent 
winter issueof Alternative Visions, 
I must seriously take into consid-
eration her claim that my article 
"Super Dode." which appeared in 
the Koala, promotes harassment, 

assaul~ or rape. The fact that sex-
ual harassment, assaults. and rapes 
occur on or near campus each year 
is a very serious matter. 

I think the nature of the article 
was pretty evident, even to her (a 
parody on the "banIeofthe sexes," 
as she called it). The content was 
not meant to be controversial. 
Salman Rushdie's Satanic Verses 
or Martin Scorcese's "Last Temp-
tation of Christ" are two perfectly 
fictitious works that bear a greater 
example of the whole issue of 
perception. 

As most people know. the ar-
tide meant no harm. With that 
taken into consideration, most 
people were probably able to re:-
late to it in one: way oranother,and 
maybe even found it somewhat 
humorous. 

The other group of people, the 
ones Rosen seems to think will be 
grc:a1ly influenced by such a bl1lSh 
publication, are the issue at hand. 

These people, [ would guess, 

are stressed, sexually-frustrated 
individuals looking for an estab-
lished institution in society to jus-
tify their own problems for them. 
If those people are to the point of 
mimicking such an act as por-
trayed in "Super Dode," then she's 
right. 

But no man has a penis that big. 
So then, "thwapping a chick on 
her head five or six times" with his 
penis should be ruled out, right? 
Those people would probably 
resort to other means. 

You cannot blame a sexual 
crime on just one item - in this 
case, my article. Take, for ex-
ample, tbearticle run in IheGuard-
ian about the Revelle senior who 
committed suicide by jumping off 
a freeway overpass. 

You cannot blame any post-
publication incidences of suicide 
on the Guardian. The circum-
stances behind every suicide are 
unique. 

Likewise, sexual crime has its 
own set of unique circumstances. 
There are certain stressors that are 
completely separate. 

It doesn't have to be my article 
that pushes people to the edge. 
Just tum on your favorite local or 
national television news program, 
or read a newspaper. 

Poor Writing Hurts Paper 
Editor: 

I am not writing in complaint 
of the material of your paper, but 
rather. your writing style. A school 
newspaper should be interesting 
and fun to read. But the Guardian 
is neither. 

Your paper fulfIlls the job of 
informing the students of events, 
problems, and news, but does so 
in a boring and tired manner. 

Each article is consistently a 
chore to read. I find it difficult to 
ever finish reading an entire ar-
ticle. After the first two paragraphs 
or so, I give up. 

Since the paper is funded by 
the UC Regents, which, in tum, 
comes from our hard-eamed edu-

BENSON 

cational fee, I feel that our funds 
can be used in a more beneficial 
way. 

Take the Koala, for example. 
Everyone can look forward to a 
new edition of their paper because 
they provide the students with 
entertaining material, something 
one cannot find in the Guardian. 

Please, either tell your staff 
writers to take a course in humor, 
or end publication and save us all 
a buck. 

Alvin Yam 
Editor's Note: The Guardian is 
supported entirely by advertising 
revenues, and receives fU} funding 
from the UC Regents. UCSD, nor 
the ASUCSD. 

Invariably you could find the 
same result of filth (Yes, I'm ad-
milling my article was filth .). 
Actual stories run on sexual 
crimes, bra ads, or feature stories 
could easily foster. fester, or trig-
ger pent-up stress. 

I laugh at Rosen's assumptions 
thatI'm "penis insecure" and that 
["fantasize about macho-man su-
perheroes" coming to my rescue. 
If anything, she has penis envy. 

If she has ever met a woman! 
girl like the one depicted in "Super 
Dode," she would know that these 
types often degrade themselves, 
and do not need theirmalecounter-
parts in a given situation to make 
themselves look bad. 

I guess it is too much for men to 
"stop their senseless competition 
with one another to possess the 
'Super Dode' trophy." What a 
generality! 

Then, I guess it is too much to 
ask women to "stop their relent-
less complaining about PMS with 
one another to see who can 'out-
bitch' the other." 

If I were a mature woman, one 
who was aware of my sex as well 
as the opposite, I'd be embar-
rassed. Hopefully someday Rosen 
will understand that men and 
women were meallt to work to-
gether, and not to be at odds with 
each other. 

So, her interpretation of "Su-
per Dode" as a "banleofthe sexes" 
is wrong, also. 

On a final note, Rosen must be 
joking when she says that the Ko-
ala is "alienating oppressed 
groups." It's sad that she consid-
ers herself alienated and op-
pressed. 

I believe men and women are 
equal, as should she. If the Koala 
is discriminating, then why are 
there women on the staff! There 
doesn't seem to be a whole hell of 
a lot of men on Alternative Vi-
sions' staff.

Police Acted Irresponsibly 
Editor: 

This is a letter of complaint 
over the conduct and action taken 
by three uniformed UCSD police 
officers. 

On the late afternoon of March 
9, at approximately 5:45 in front 
of Round Table Pizza in the Price 
Center Plaza, a considerable 
number of individuals and myself 
witnessed the following: 

There was a male caucasian, 
approximately 40 years old, sit-
ting at one of the tables in the Price 
Center Plaza. Between 5:30 and 
5:45, I observed three police offi-
cers converge on the above-men-
tioned individual. I thought this 
was rather odd, seeing as this 
individual wassilling, minding his 
own business and not causing harm 
to anybody. 

I was not within earshot; how-
ever, it was quite apparent that the 
officers were interrogating him. 
They proceeded to scrutinize his 
identification and took the liberty 
of removing all of his belongings 

from his backpack. 
During this interrogation, a 

group of four students passing by 
noticed the situation, and one of 
them mumbled something under 
his breath. Afterspeaking with his 
friends, I discovered that what he 
had said was merely, "poor fel-
low." I assume he was refening to 
the interrogated individual. All 
three officers immediately ordered 
the student to sit down, and with a 
small bit of hesitation (probably 
out of surprise and intimidation), 
he complied with the order. 

One of the officers proceeded 
10 question the student while, at 
the same time, grasping his right 
wrist and handcuffing it. 

Myself and many others stood 
in shock as we watched the offi-
cers use their power so blatantly. 
In fact, I couldn't believe it; yet 
here it was, happening before my 
eyes. 

In the end, the original suspect 
was released while the student was 
handcuffed and led away by the 

Gameroom 
It's/or everyone!

that they were taking him to the 
police station. 

I am sorry that I had to write 
this letter, but I could not stand by 
and let this happen without/eUing 
you know how I felt about it. 

I support the police because I 
believe in what they are doing; 
however, when they begin to hand-

something must be wrong. 

I sincerely hope that action is 
taken by the UCSD Police to rem-
edy whatever policy error caused 
this incident.

OPINION 5 

Editorial Was Mindless 
Editor: 

l am writing in response to the 
extremely naive editorial in the 
Guardian ("A Li tany of Failures," 
March 8) denouncing A.S. fund-
ing of the Pro-Choice Forum be-
cause: the forum was a "political" 
event. It is one thing for the likes 
of George Bush to complacently 
proclaim the ideology of liberal 
pluralism, and manufacture dis-
tinctions between what is "politi-
cal" and what isn't, but for a stu-
dent newspaper to so uncritically 
parrot these myths is irresponsible 
journalism, and a disgrace to the 
university and the principles of 
critical thinking and writing that it 
claims to teach. 

To mindlessly condemn the 
A.S. for funding the forum is to 
imply a) that it is possible to find 
events that are totall y isolated from 
"politics" forthe A.S. to fund and 
b) that the A.S. shouldn't be tak-
ing a stand on important political 
issues. Now, you might suppose 
that a TG is an exemplary "non-

political" event, but recent heated 
A.S. debates over the issueof"cul-
rurally diverse" TGs are clear evi-
dence of just how "political" even 
so innocuous-seemjng an event as 
a TG is. Further, to suppose that 
the Pro-Choice Forum would have 
been "non-political" had some 
anti-choice speakers been invited 
is to fall into the trap (vociferously 
perpetuated at election time when 
themainstreammediapresentRe- -
publican and Democratic candi-
dates as representative of a wide 
range of choice - as the only 
choice - for voters) of assuming 
that there are only two perspec-
tives on any issue, and that there 
are not enough differences 
amongst pro-choice candidates for 
debate and divergency to flourish 
amongst them. Liberal pluralism, 
although it presents itself as "ob-
jective," is itself a political posi-
tion that forcefully maintains the 
status quo in power relations.

implication of your editorial, namely the 
implication that the A.S. shouldn' t fund 
"poli tical" events. I find this attitude irre-
sponsible and repulsively immoral, because 
silence itself is a powerful political state-
ment. 

Are we as students to abdicate our re-
sponsibi lity to speak out on pressing moral 
issues under the guise of not wanting to 
make "political" pronouncements? Do we 
refuse to take a stand on whether the UC 
should divest from South Africa because 
we want to remain "apolitical," despite the 
fact that our silence may directly cause 
further suffering for black South Africans? 

And does this notion of promoting "dif-
fering points of view" (a quote from the 
Guardian editorial) mean that for any dis-
cussion of anti-Semitism to take place it 
behooves us to invite self-proclaimed Na-
zis to the forum, because, after all, it wouldn 't

The Associated Students: Empty Rhetoric, No Action 
Editor: 

It bas been said that student leadership positions inside the 
UCSD community are good preparation for similar positions in 
the outside world. Ifiliat is the case, then the current A.S. admini-
stration is a wonderful success if we consider how closely their 
vacuous rhetoric approaches that of professional politicians. 

President John Ramirez is a case in point. Tn his "State of the 
Campus" address, he emphatically stated that the TG issue was 
a cultural issue. 

Later, when he became aware that this was politically un-
popular, he pivoted 180 degrees on his stance and wrote a 
Gutlrdian letter saying that his interference in the TGs hadabso-
lutely nothing to do with culture. 

The truth is, as previous GUDrdian letters have pointed out, 
the issue of variety in TO bands is a non-issue. Ramirez chose to 
focus his activiliesonsymbolic issues such as "ethnicifying" the 
TGs instead of taking on more substantial issues, the majority of 
Which would have involved unpleasant conflicts with the cam-
pus administration. something Ramirez seems to want to avoid 

at all costs. 
Ramirez may have forgotten that there is more to being an A.S. 

representative than getting good recommendations from the 
chancellor at the year's end. 

President Ramirez notes in his letter to the Guardian that the 
threat of the co-ops being evicted is something that needs "imme-
diate attention." If the past is any indication, "immediate atten-
tion" is a Ramirez euphemism for " 'et's wait and see what hap-
pens." 

Despite the urgent tone of his letter. Ramirez was conspi. 
cously absent from the March 9 "Save the Co-ops" rally, where 
his presence and influence may have served to induce a much 
greater level of student support for this important cause. 

From the cryptic rantings of Vanness Harris to the empty 
rhetoric of John Ramirez, the current A.S. members have cer-
tainly shown themselves to be masters of rhetoric. 

Hopefully, this spring, voters will be given an opportunity 10 
elect representatives who are masters of action.

RENOVATION 
Continued rrom page 3 
their present "poor" or "very poor" 
condition for several years, either 
because they did not qualify fort he 
UC improvement program or be-
cause they were denied funds . 

UCSD had requested $7.5 mil-

lion in earthquake funding, but only 
received 2. 12 million. 

Buildings rated "poor" or "very 
poor" in 1978 that were denied 
earthquake renovation funding 
from the UC include the Revelle 
Provost's Office, the bridge be-
tween Bonner and Mayer Halls, 
the Recreation Gym, and Urey Hall. 

Jennifer Kolsky/Guardian 
A sum of $150,000 will be spent on diagonal rod bracing for the 
walls of the Natatorium, rated as ·poor" by a 1978 study. 

The UCSD Guardian 

Other buildings declared earth-
quake-vulnerable in 1978 were not 
eligible for funding because they 
require moreexlensive renovation 
than provided for in the $50 mil-
lion UC allocalion. These include 
the Biology Building, Old Ritter 
HaIl (Scripps), and the Medical 
Center North Annex. 

About half the buildings on 
campus are nol state-funded and 
are Iherefore not eligible for UC 
seismic improvement funds, Hell -
mann added. These buildings, built 
with donated money orotherfunds, 
include the Price Center, Tioga 
Hall, and the Third College dorms, 
Hellmann said. 

However, Hellmann said that 
earthquake safety problems in most 
of Ihe non-slate-funded buildings 
have been addressed in the past, 
and nOled that those buildings tend 
to be "in better shape" than state-
funded buildings becau.se they are 
usually newer and have met tougher 
building codes. 

A UCSD-sponsored study of 
the earthquake safety of all cam-
pus buildings will be released later 
this month. 

PLAN 
Continued from pap 1 
be prepared for the upcoming 
construction. 

A specific plan for communi-
cations involving the library ad-
dition will include moving the 
scale model of the addition out 
of the library to the Price Center. 
Fliers explaining the construc-
tion will be distributed to mem-
bers of college councils, which 
will be encouraged to distribute 
them among the students. Infor-
mational fliers will al.so be placed 
in major cafeterias andcommuler 
lounges. 

The plan for ongoing campus 
construction outlines three ma-
jor goals: the first concerning 
the explanation of various proj-
ects to begin on campus within 
the next 24 months, another to 
inform the campus community 
of the construction 's significance 
to UCSD programs, and the third 
to encourage involvement in 
those programs.

Coping With 
Eating Disorders 
Getting Over Problem is Anything But Easy 
Story by Renee Adams 
Guardian Reporter 

Eating disorders have become an important issue of public concern recently. While many people are aware of the symptoms of 
eating disorders and are capable of detect-

ing the problem in others, students may nOI 
realize that there are support groups on campus 
that deal with eating disorders on an intimate 
basis. 

According to Beverly Harju. a counseling psy-
chologist who coordinates the "Recovering from 
Eating Disorders" program at UCSD, eating dis-
orders occur, mostly among women, in one of 
three forms. Bulimia is characterized by binging 
and purging. Those with anorexia abstain from 
eating food. The third and increasingly common 
form of eating disorder is compulsive overeating, 
a cycle of binging and dieting. 

Eating disorders are usually caused by a com-
bination of factors. Harju said that important 
causes are: the inability to deal with imperfection, 
a negative self-image, family problems, lack of

Psychological Services] 
and say: 'Here I am, fix 
me' are not going to get 
better.'

an ability to relate to others, and the failure to con-
form to the society's ideal of thinness. 

According to Karen Bissiri, peer counselor at 
UCSD's Psychological Services, individuals af-
flicted with eating disorders can only be cured if 
they are willing to work hard to change them-
selves. 

Bissiri said people who have recovered from 
eating disorders can play an important role in 
helping others recover. In general, she said, 

everyone must learn to become less prejudiced 
against obese people and to be more supportive of 
others. 

Peer counselors Bissiri and Liz Dittrich both 
had problems with eating disorders. Bissiri was 
bulimic for seven years. Dittrich was bulimic and a 
compulsive overeater for three years. Both said 
they used food as a tool to deal with difficult 
situations. 

Bissiri and Dittrich agreed that the real burden 
of eating disorders is not the physical problems as-
sociated with the disorders, but rather the emo-
tional side effects. 

The counselors said people with eating disorders 
suffer from the feeling that they have a terrible 
problem which they must hide from their friends 
and relatives. They lack the feeling of being able to 
control their lives. As a result, they usually have 
low self-esteem and a poor body image. 

Bissiri said she had to walk on the road behind 
the Main Gym at UCSD because she could not bear 
the feeling that the people on the gym steps were 
watching her. On some days, she said, "I just could

not go to class because I felt too 
fat. " 

The main challenge that people 
with eating disorders face is find-
ing the necessary motivation to 
deal with their problem. The peer 
counselors said this is no easy task, 
since the fear that they are doing 
something forbidden often pre-
vents people from getting help. 

Friends often try to convince 
people with eating disorders to 
undergo treatment. But if the 
afflicted people are not completely 
willing to undergo the healing 
process, they will usually discon-
tinue treatment before they can be 
cured, Dittrich said. 

Even ifthe desire to get help is 
genuine, many do not realize that 
they must work very hard to change 
their behavior and self-perception, 
Bissiri noted. 

"People who come in [toPsy-
chological Services] and say: • Here 
I am, fix me' are not going to get 
belter," Bissiri said.

" We are in a unique s ituation. 
Competing against such a peren-

We need to forget about Kenyon 
and just prepare to be national

year that our people are learning 
how to be champions. Our attempt 
this year was admirable and we are 
making a commitment to be na-

" There is no mystique about

our guys, despite losing eleven 
seniors, will compete," he said.

PHIL'S ANAL YSIS ... A1lright, it's down 
to the wire tonight in a game which pits two 
schools that have never won it aiL That is, 
of course, until UNL V puts the finishing 
touches on its tournament success with what 
should be a commanding victory. Besides, 
nobody in college basketball - and quite 
possibly pro basketball - can match up 
with UNLV's Larry Johnson. Have you 
seen this guy? He makes Patrick Ewing 
look like Christian Laettner. As for Duke, 
well, urn, well, you just don't win with all 
those yuppies running around the court. 
Besides, ifUNL V wins, I'll finish in second

victory over Azusa Pacific in the opener of a March 
12 doubleheader. 

With UCSD trailing by two runs heading into the 
last half of the seventh. Chaiken's single tied the 
score and sent the game into extra innings. 1ben. in 
the 11 th, another one of her singles won the game. 

Kehr, who leads the team with 15 RBis, had a 
standout perfonnance in the firsl game against 
Claremont when she went 4 for 4 with three doubles. 

Bul the recent success (after a 2-6 start. the 
Tritons have now won 10 of their last 12) has not 
been an entirely offensive achievement, for the 
Triton pitching has been exceptional. 

How else can you possibly explain the success of 
a team when a regular starter's ERA of 1.23 
(Stutzman's) is third best among starters? 

Sophomore Dianna Moreno (2-1) leads the team 
with a 0.72 ERA (only three earned runs in 29 1/3 
innings). Junior Kathy Fogg, withonJyeighteamed 
runs in 57 innings, is second on the learn at 0.98. and 
has not surrendered a single earned run in her last 14 
innings.

It ' s not quite in the same league 
as, say, Joe DiMaggio ' s hilling 
streak, but UCSO baseball Coach 
Lyle Yates made his mark on base-
ball lore with his 200th career vic-
tory Saturday against the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin-Whitewater. 

The win came in the first game 
of a doubleheader sweep, and wa 
the third sweep by the Tritons (14-
8-2) over a two and a half week 
period. 

The Tritons have swept five 
doubleheaders in a row for :1 new 
school record. 

In the opener, UCSD staked 
itselflo an early lead with two runs 
in the first inning, and Mike Mor-
gan (4-0) held off UWW for six 
innings before getting relief help 
from Dann Eaton to record the 3-2 
victory. 

The Tritons rallied for two runs 
in the eighth inning of the nightcap 
to break a I-I tie and escape with a 
3- 1 win, despite being out-hit 14-7 
on the day. J.J. Fisher ( 1-3) tossed

Louie Diaz and the Tritons went all out in sweeping Wisconsin-

a five-hitter for his first victory. 
In earlier action, the Tritons -

currently ranked II th nationally 
- swept Division II Wayne State 
of Nebraska, 8- 1 and 8-7 on March 
12. Morgan and C.J. Meyer ( 1-0) 
each recorded wins. 

March 24 featured a match up 
between the two top-ranked teams 
on the West Coasl, as 15th ranked 
Occidental College rode into town. 

The Triton virtually handed the 
game to the Tigers, as Eaton and 
Morgan issued seven walks and hit 
two batters in an 8-6 loss. 

UCSDcontinued its three-game 
mini-slump with an II - II tie at 
Cal State Hayward on March 26. 

The game was littered with 
controversy when the Tritons 
scored a run in the top of the 12th 
inning 10 make the score 12-1 1. 

With two out and two Pioneer 
men on in the bottom of the 12th, 
the umpires called the game due to 
darkness. 

UCSO broke out of its brief 
slide on March 27, crushing Menlo 
College 8-4 and 9-2 at Menlo. 
Anthony Sanchez went two for 
three, including a two-run home 
run in the seventh inning. Morgan 
went the distance for the win. 

(n the nightcap, first-yearplayer 
Ryan Aanagan (I-I) took over for 
starter Rick Rupkey, who came 
out with a sore shoulder, in the sec-
ond inning and pitched 6 1/3 shut-
oul innings to get the victory.

the UC Santa Barbara Tournament this past weekend. 

UCSD opened with a 19-0 pounding of Brown on Friday afternoon. The going the next morniog , 
against UC Berteley was" bit tougher, but the Tritons puUed away for a 9-4 win. In the process, they 
gained revenge on the Bears. who are the only ones not to fall to the top-ranked Tritons this season.

Men's Swimming Second at Nationals 
UCSD Accumulates Highest 
Point Total in School History; 
Kenyon Captures 11 th Straight 

By BRIAN ITOW 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's swimming 
team placed econd at the Di vision 
III National Championship -
again. 

For the fifth time in six years, 
the Tritons played second fiddle to 
a dominating Kenyon squad. But 
this time, something was different. 

This time, the Tritons were ac-
tually only a splash away from the 
eleven-time (consecutive) national 
champion, as the Lords outscored 
UCSD 653-535. 

Through the first half of the 
meet, UCSD's swimmers per-
formed brilliantly . Midway 
through the second day of the three 
day competition, the Tritons trailed 
by just 46 points and Kenyon 
seemed catchable. But the Lords 
were able to capture 76 points in 
the 400 medley relay - an event 
in which the Triton were shut out. 

Suddenly, the Tritons found 
themselves 122 points behind. 
Kenyon had dug a hole that the 
Tritons could not climb out of. 

we never gave up." 
The last event, the 400 free re-

lay pretty much summed up how 
the meet went for the Tritons. 

The UCSD team of Steve De-
nys, Jason Vance, Rich Daniel, 
and Darren Fredrick swam the 
event in a school record 3:00.58. 
That time would have been good 
enough to place second in the 
Division II National Champion-
ship competition. 

However, it was not enough to 
beat a Kenyon team whose time of 
2:59.78 would have won the Divi-
sion II race handily and would 
have placed in Division I. 

Although the Tritons swam their 
best meet ever, Kenyon had just 
enough to keep them at bay. No 
matter how well the Tritons swam, 
they could not gain any ground on 
Kenyon and fell 118 points short 
of a first national championship. 

Still, Morgan felt that the Tri-
ton swimmers outperformed 
Kenyon's. However, his team did 
not enough have enough stars 
qualifying for event finals to over-
come the Division ill power. 

"They had a few more quality 
guys who could finish in the top 
four point-getting spots than we 
did. And, wedidn 'thave very much 

"That event pretty much sealed 
the coffin on our chances," UCSD 
Head Coach Bill Morgan said, "but 
we never gave up. Right down to 
the la t event, we never relaxed, See M. SWIM, page 17 The second-place Tritons display school pride, flashing a "Triton Fork" after receiving their trophy. 

Stutzman's Perfect 
I Game Heads UCSD 
Softball Turnaround 
By PHIL GRUEN 
Senior Staff Writer 

For a while, it appeared as if the UCSD softball team 
had lost all of the magic which carried it to a record 35 
victories in the 1989 ~ampaign. 

I The team was struggling at 6-8 and needed a break-
and they got one. Spring Break, that is. 

Kim Stutzman's perfect game on March 24 against 
Augsburg College (MN) highlighted a perfect Spring 
Break, as the Tritons climbed four games above the .500 
level with six victories. 

The wins included two each from Azusa Pacific, 
Claremont, and Augsburg, and improve the Tritons' rec-
ord to 12-8, shedding new light on what was previously 
a dismal post-season picture. 

Stutzman, a first-year player, faced the minimum 21 
batters while striking out four in an 8-0 trouncing in the 
first game against the Auggies at home. Stutzman, cur-
rently 5-0, boasts a 1.23 ERA in 40 innings of work. 

Augsburg, which was playing its first games of the 
year, rebounded to score a couple of runs in the nightcap, 
but the Tritons still prevailed with a 4-2 victory. 

UCSD also swept home twinbills from Azusa Pacific, 
4-3 and 3-0, with which UCSD split its first meeting and 
Claremont, 11 -1 and 3-1, over the break. In the six 
games, UCSD out cored its opponents 33-7. 

Catcher Tracey Kehr and shortstop Dana Chaiken 
have led the Triton offense during the recent surge. 
Chaiken, who leads the team with 24 hits and a .381 
average, was the catalyst in UCSD's 4-3 comeback

Women's Tennis Trounces Three 
By DANA CHAIKEN 
Sports Editor 

In what the UCSD women's tennis 
team considered a version of "rnini-
nationals", the Tritons nearly swept 
forrnernational foe Gustavus-Adolphus 
(MN),8-1. 

The Tritons (10-4) did manage to 
capture all nine matches against their

Spring Break, downing Emory (GA), 

and Claremont this past Saturday. 
In preparation for the G-A match, 

UCSD hosted two Division I schools, 
falling to both 8-1. 

Against the University ofthe Pacific, 
Kristen Diels pulled off the only Triton 
victory, a 6-1 , 6-2 breeze at number six 
singles. 

The number two doubles team of 
Robyn Inaba and Janet Whalen posted 
the only ' W' for UCSD against the

Head Coach Liz LaPlante ex-
plained that "the Division I matches 
were really just to gear up for the 
Divsion ill matches in the following 
days." 

The victory over G-A, which fin-
ished fourth at nationals last year, 
was especially important because "it 
really let us know we have a chance 
to repeat as national champions," 
LaPlante said of the nationally top-
ranked Tritons. 

Susan Carney pulled off three singles victories and teamed with Christine Behrens for two in doubles over break.

IIFirst College" Opens Doors This Week 

New Name for Third College 
By JASON PHILLIPS II 
Contibllting Writer 

It took nearly 20 years, but a 
permanent name for Third College 
was finally approved when Third 
Provost Cecil Lytle made his rec-
ommendation to the UC Regents 
at a meeting last week. 

First College, the new name, 
will go into effect later this week, 
beginning with the official scrap-
ing of the Third College lettering 
on the small stone wall in front of 
Peterson Hall. 

Lytle decided upon First Col-
lege because, according to him, "it 
will help promote our college as 
one that should be 'first' in the 
hearts of the applicants." 

Lytle, apparently, has been 
concerned with the college's im-
age in the past, pointing out that 
high school applicants rarely put 
down Third College as their first 

choice among the UCSD colleges. 
In a letter, Lytle explained that 

"Third College is far behind Muir 
and Revelle in terms of the number 
of students who choose Third as 
their first choice." Because of the 
proposals for three new UCSD 
colleges in the near future, Lytle 
was afraid that" ... Third College 
will slip from college of fourth 
choice, to the college of fifth 
choice . .. and so on." He said that a 
title such as " First College" should 
help alleviate these problems. 

"Everybody will know where 
to turn to first," Lytle stated 
proudly, with a knowing grin. 

Lytle's recommendation of the 
First College name comes follow-
ing heated debate concerning the 
renaming process in previous 
weeks. Other names, including 
Rosa Parks College, Martin Lu-
ther King College, SojoumerTruth 
College, Atkinson University, 

Bishop Tutu College, and 2 Live 
Crew College, were also consid-
ered. 

To aid in the renaming process, 
Lytle, who has served as Third 
Provost for four years, formed a 
"Renaming Committee" consist-
ing of five students, one staff 
member, and three faculty mem-
bers. The purpose of the commit-
tee, according to Lytle, was to gi ve 
the college a "more meaningful" 
name. 

The committee, however, had 
selected "2 Live Crew College," a 
sugge tion which Lytle paid "no 
attention to," according to com-
mittee member Rhonda Jacobs. 

"The 2 Live Crew have done a 
lot for the university, and for soci-
ety as a whole," Jacobs aid. "Our 
selection was supposed to be advi-
sory, but Lytle obviously did not 
pay any attention to it." 

Lytle, however, disagreed. 
"I rec06nize the influence the 2 

Live Crew has had on the music in-
dustry, but their material is just a

Survey Finds UCSD Students 
Among Lowest in Overall IQ 

The price of parking on cam-
pus will rise $20 this quarter for 
the owners of either student or 
graduate parking permits, the 
UCSD Parking Office announced 
Friday. 

The fee increase announce-
ment followed the bulldozing of 
several Third College parking lots 
last week to make room for a 
Staff Club. 

According to UCSD parking 
spokesman Lanita Jackson, the 
parking pennits sold this quarter 
will cost $100 for graduate and 
faculty pennits and $80 for stu-
dent permits - S20 more than 
last quarter. 

Jackson also said that those 
people who already own pennits 
must also pay the additional S20. 

People who own annual per-
mits will need to purchase a spe-
cial purple sticker, featuring a 
picture of Chancellor Richard At-
kinson. whicb must be attached 
to their present penniL These 
stickers will be mandatory in all 
lots by April 8, Jacksonexplaioed. 
Those who bave a pennit but DO 
sticker will be forced to pay a fine 
of S38.50. Those with neither 
sticker nor pennit will be charged 
$14.

"What are they going to charge 
ifI shove it up my --1," queried 
Muir junior Joseph McGinty. 

'The price increase was alleg-
edly imposed as a means to lessen 
fee increases in the future, and to 
help fund future UCSD parking 
lots inOel Mar and Solana Beach. 

"By charging $20 now, we 
can generate revenue now and 
not have to raise the fees even 
more in the future, when we'l1 
have to build a monorail to trans-
port students to campus from tbe 
Del Mar p'arking lots," said Lisa 
Pepperidge of the Planned De-
velopment Department. 

However, Parking Office 
Manager Rob Bumstead, speak-
ing on condition of anonymity, 
admitted that parking rates would

Associate News Dork 

A nationwide study of un ivers i-
ties, junior colleges, and high 
schools has discovered that the 
average intelligence quotient of 
UCSD undergraduate students 
ranks near the bottom of the insti-
tutions studied. 

The study places the IQ of 
UCSD students below 60 percent 
of all American universities and 
junior colleges, and below 20 per-
cent of all American high schools. 

In a press conference last Thurs-
day, Tracey Lewis of the Ameri-
can Society of Research (ASR) 
announced that the results of the 
study were not unexpected. 

"When we initially contacted 
[UCSD Chancellor Richard) At-
kinson about the urvey, he was 
reluctant to participate in the 
study," Lewis said. "He said he 
was worried about a possible loss 
of faculty and, therefore, prestige 
for the university." 

The study placed UCSD 560th 
on the list of 600 institutions, right 
behind the University of Nevada, 
Las Vegas. Tied for last place on 
the list were the Nonhem Texas 
School of Mines and Oranges, UC 
Santa Cruz, and San Diego State 

University. 
Because of UCSD's unique 

five-college educational system, 
the study broke UCSD down into 
five eparate overall IQ categories 
for each college. The average in-
telligence quotients for the UCSD 
colleges, according to the study, 
are as follows: Revelle, 88; Fifth, 
80; Third, 76; Warren, 35; Muir, 
12. 

The nationwide average IQ, as 
determined by the study, is 100. 

Lewis pointed out that the aver-
age IQs for Revelle, Fifth, and 
Third students were hardly accept-
able with respect to the nationwide 
average, and that the students at 
Warren and Muir had the average 
IQ of a rock. 

Lewis added that while Revelle 
College did have the highe t IQ of 
any UCSD college, the study had 
no way of measuring gullibility or 
lack of common ense. 

The ASR study was performed 
on everal levels. All UCSD stu-
dents were given actual intelligence 
tests, but ASRobservers were also 
tationed in the parking lots, tak-

ing note of student parking habits; 
inside EDNA, counting the num-
ber of students who asked for di-
rections to the UCSD Bookstore: 
and also in Revelle Plaza, tallying 

the number of students who sign 
petitions without reading them. 

Accordillg to the ASR report, 
the top five university IQs were, in 
ascending order, Princeton. Cal 
Tech, MIT, UC Berkeley, andY ale. 
Dartmouth College, which had 
occupied top-five spots in previ-
ous years, dropped to 367th. 

Dartmouth College Pre ident 
Bennett Boychuckle explained that 
the drop in the rankings was 
" ... probably due to the fact that 
when [the ASR] did their polling, 
we had so many of those goddamn 
UCSD students on our campus." 

Boychuckle aid that because 
of thi ,Dartmouth plans to end its 
UCSD exchange program soon. 

The results from aspecial study, 
concerning the intelligence. humor, 
and personal hygiene of the UCSD 
media were al 0 released last week. 
According to Lewis, results of that 
tudy are not yet complete. 

"One of our researchers was 
ent out to study the bathing habits 

of certain alternative newspapers, 
but became ill and had to be hospi-
talized," he said. 

Atkin on had a lot to ay con-
cerning the study result . 

"Blue poppy wart elephant 
Vigoda poo," Atkinson explained.

CWH Presents Film Series Friday 

The Committee for World Hygiene (CWH), as part of 
it health film series, will present four films on personal 
hygiene Friday evening at 7 p.m. in Peterson Hall lOS. 

"The Agony of Ear Wax Build-up," by noted director 
Ben Casey, M.D., is about the passionate relationship be-
tween two a piring playwrights, one of whom endures 
excruciating pain when his partner attempts to lick inside 
his ear. 

"We hear it 's an ear-opener," CWH director Arnold 
Branin said. 

"Bad Breath Blues," directed by little-known video 
artist Roman Polman, is, in the director' s words, "a per-
sonal extension of my body, my personality, my lovers, 
the cute little doggie that lived next door, and intoxicat-
ing body odor." 

Next,Charles Barkley's "Underarm Tactics" takes a 
graphic and disturbing look at the exploitation of smell 
testers by the deodorant industry. 

Finally. Merlin Olsen ' s "Broccoli Brouhaha" shows 
how Pre ident Bush' recent declaration against broc-
coli was actually part of a devilish plot to reduce the red 
blood cell levels of American leftist radicals. 

Medical Center Surgeons Perform 
Their First Sex Change Operation 

Surgeon at the UCSD Medical Center perfornled 
their first successful sex change operation on March 19. 

According to Surgeon Marcus Welby, the operation 
on 23-year-old Fifthjunior Phil Myerson (formerly Phyllis 
Myerson) wa an "unqualified success." 

" He will be able to do everything any other man can 
do now. He'll be able to fart loudly with his friends, drink 
lots of beer. and pass out," Welby aid. 

However, not all were thrilled with the success of the 
operation. Myerson's former boyfriend, Brian Derks, 
sa id he was not told of the operation until last week. 

"1 wish someone had let me know before 1 asked her 
out last Friday." Derks lamented. "It would have saved 
me a lot of unnecessary embarassmenl." 

Myerson was not available for comment, but friends 
said he was recovering successfully from the operation, 
aside from strange urges to watch "Oprah," call CSOs, 
and sit down while uri nating.

Architectural Firm Chosen to Build 
New Building; Students Protest 

UCSD has chosen the prestigious Albuquerque, NM 
architectural firm of Brownstein, Goldberg, Rosenthal , 
and Rodriguez to design the new Southwestern Inter-
American Hemisphere Institute of the Scientific Eco-
nomics and Social Sciences (SIHISES) building, to be 
built by 1993. 

The $55-million building, to house the departments of 
visual literature, non-mathematical economics, quasi-
religious physics, and Eskimo studies, will be built on the 
Hump. It is one of severa.llarge, "architecturally progres-
sive" buildings called for in the campus Long Range 
Development Plan. 

The SIHlSES building is to be a combination Mexi-
can/Scandinavian design, featuring a siesta room sur-
rounded by a fjord. 

Several students have objected to the impending con-
struction of a building on the Hump, spar\.<ing a "Hug the 
Hump" campaign. 

"Hug the damned Hump! Hug the damned Hump!"

" Don't be apathetic - iflhe hump goes, the Che may 

be next!" the apoplectic Howard screamed to an empty 
crowd. 

Noted businessman Sol Price defended the building's 
proposed design. 

"At UCSD, we 're not looking at anyone particular 
style," Price said, pointing out that Warren 's architec-
ture looks nothing like Muir' s, and Revelle 's isjustplain 
disgusting. 

"Obviously, it's diversity that makes this campus 
click - whether it's diversity in TGs or diversity in 
architecture," Price said. "The fact that a culturally di-
verse building will be placed on the Hump is extremely 
significant concerning the current controversy surround-
ing the future of the TGs." 

Hypochondriacs Sought for Study 
The Gross Sicknesses Medical Research Lab at the 

UCSD Medical Center is seeking people with severe hypo-
chondria to take part in a study of different drug therapies 
to treat this painful and debilitating condition. 

"If you're the kind of person who gets sick with some 
awful and deadly disease every week, then we're looking 
for you." said Chief Researcher James Pagginga. 

Each patient accepted for the study will receive highly-
addictive and expensive drugs to treat his condition, and 
will be given bus fare.

Council Holds Fiery Meeting FIRST: A Name for Third 
Wong Sets Hair Ablaze in Anger Following Beer Debate 

By Mm FARKNOOGLE 
Senior Staph Injection 

The A.S Council voted on a 
variety of vacuous issues last 
night, including bills concerning 
TGs and the Constitutional Con-
vention. 

Matt Schnurer, programmed 
commissioner, submitted a bill 
requesting money for a "Barry 
Week," to honor Barry Manilow. 

"He writes the songs," Sch-
nurer said. 

"People with large noses have 
been traditionally underrepre-
sented in programming," A.S. 
Precedent John Ramirez said. 

confederate flag screens for the 
back windows of pick-up trucks. 
"We also should serve cider in-
stead of beer," added Malloy, 
"Poor white trash like cider. I saw 
it on the ' Andy Griffith Show.'" 

"I think those of us on the 
A.S., who are rich white trash, 
owe it to the less fortunate," said 
Molly McKay, Sun Chicken 
Commissioner. " Is George 
Thorogood available?" 

Wong attempted to restore order, 
but a heated debate had begun on 
whether lite beer tastes great, is 
less filling, oris actually fermented 
bat urine. 

Wong pulled out a Brookstone 
brass lighter and threatened to set 
his hair on fire if people didn ' t 
calm down. 

Wong is listed in stable condi-
tion at Scripps Hospital, with bums 
over 30 percent of his eyebrows.

bit too profane," Lytle said. " How 
can we let our college be named 
after a group that recommends that 
women should get the ---- out of 
our houses?" Lytle said, noting that 
although it is rare, some of the in-
coming students are under 18 years 
old and are not yet old enough to 
purchase a 2 Live Crew album 
without parental consent. 

"First College will not create 
any controversy," Lytle continued, 
" because it cannot be judged on the 
basis of race, creed, or religion. But 
with names such as '2 Live Crew 
College,' 'Rosa Parks College,' and 
' Bishop Tutu College,' we had 
some of those problems." 

Many Third students were furi-
ous, indicating that they felt "pow-

erless" and virtually "at the will of 
the administration" when it came 
to the renaming. 

UCSD Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson, in a rare telephone in-
terview from his sixth home atop 
Capitol Hill in Washington D.C., 
laughed hysterically when he dis-
covered that students actually 
thought they would have a say in 
the renaming of the college. 

"What, are you kidding?" At-
kinson said. "The students are only 
here for about five, six, or seven 
years. r ve been here for \0. Cecil's 
been here forever. We still care 
about this university. Students 
don 't. Students are useless. Ex-
cuse me, I've got an important call 
from a faculty member on the other 
line." 

Debate was interrupted by an 
argument about what to get on 
the pizzas being ordered by Geek 
Student Representative Paul 
Eykamp, with the final consen-
sus being for broccoli and extra 
goat cheese. 

TIle AS. Council also debated 
a bill by Senator John Edson con-
cerning the AS. Constitutional 
Convention, which is scheduled 
for February , 1997. The five-hour 
debate concerned what kind of 
plastic cups should be used at the 
convention. 

"The A.S. Constitution clearly 
mandates what kind of cups 
should be used! It's in there 
somewhere, I think," said Jim 
Edwards, commissioner of sev-
eral committees whose names 
escape me and whose purposes 
escape everyone. 

PARKING: Rates Going Up 

The Barry proposal was de-
feated by a vote of 22 to 21, with 
the pizza delivery woman casting 
the deciding vote. 

Trivial Affairs Commissioner 
Darin Malloy submitted a bill 
requiring another culturally di-
verse TG. 

" We need to reach poor white 
trash," said Malloy. The bill sug-
gests that sponsorship be sought 
from the company which makes 

At this point, Schnurer, who 
had been slumped in his chair in 
an alcoholic daze, leaped up, 
turned on the Price Center muzak 
master switch, and shouted 
"Conga line! " All of the fresh-
man senators joined in immedi-
ately. 

VP Admonishment Alex 

Yom.rna/Guardian 
In the midst of a heated de-
bate, Alex Wong was no match 
for the overriding power of the 
A.S when he lit his hair on fire 
last night. 

Continued from page 1 
When called for comment, for-

mer Studenl Advocate Bard-Alan 
Finlan said, "This new policy is 
disgraceful. It really takes advan-
tage of the students , and leaves 
them with no say or influence in 
terms of how the university is 
managed. Please leave a message 
at the tone." 

AS. President John Ramirez 
questioned what effect the new 
parking fees would have on student 
safety. 

"When people leave AS. Coun-
c il meetings at 3 a.m., they don't 
want to have to walk far because 

they can't pay parking rates," 
Ramirez said. "They j ust want to 
go home and unwind. Me, I like to 
kick back and down a couple of 
brews." 

Members ofthe New Incinera-
tor collective are organizing a 
student strike, to occur next Satur-
day, to protest the new fees. 

"By striking and not coming to 
school thai day, we can show the 
administration who's boss' " col-
lective member Monty Kroopkin 
said. 

The collective members were 
apparently unaware that school is 
not in session on weekends.

A Formal Retraction 

We Take it All Back 
The editorial board of the Guardian would like to apologize to 

its readers. It is the duty of a newspaper to report information ac-
curately and honestly , yet we have been printing unresearched, 
unfounded, illogical, iII-conceived, misinformed, and poorly 
written editorials on these pages for over six months, and now 
we're paying the price. The only reason we've gotten away with 
it is because no one reads them. Therefore, the editorial board 
wishe to retract every editorial written since September 1989. 
We were wrong about everything. We take it all back. 

First and foremost, our attacks on the A.S. have been harsh and 
unfair. What were we thinking when we called the A.S. " silly"? 
UCSD is a cultural wasteland, brimming with social and racial 
repression. We were wrong in anacking A.S. President John 
Ramirez for interfering with Commissioner of Prograrnrning 
Matt Schnurer in the name of cultural diversity . The problem was 
so hidden that apparently even the students didn't realize they 
weren't being well represented. In fact, TGs were an abject fail-
ure, and the people who thought they were enjoying them were 
fooled, probably by some sort of drug in the beer. 

We were wrong in attacking the A.S . for blocking such a seem-
ingl y innocuous event as "Elvis Week." Such an event could have 
shattered cultural progress and led to racial conflict of epic 
proportions, not to mention a possible epidemic of fat men 
wearing sequined white suits and shaking their pelvises. 

In the spirit of introducing other cultures, the A.S. should pro-
vide German beer at the TOs, and possibly even yogurt. Culture 
has its advantages. Reggae is our friend. Culture is our friend. 
Elvis is dead. 

We were wrong to condemn the UC-wide Fighting Words 
Policy , as well as its A .S. supporters. We were unable to see that 
the Fighting Words Policy promotes an atmosphere of peace and 
serenity, where the little guy is safe from unnecessary verbal 
abuse. The UC has reminded us all of the virtues of Mrs. Jones ' 
kindergarten class: Be kind to your neighbor. If you don't have 
anything nice to say, don't say it at all. And stop picking your bun. 

The Fighting Word Policy is a bold step toward a university-
wide cultural utopia. The policy, as well as Ramirez's bold action 
in diversifying the TGIF program, has caused racial and cultural 
tension to subside substantially. In fact, students have begun 
spontaneously bursting into song. Many of them even sing 
culturally diverse songs, like "La Bamba" and "Ffere Jacques." 

Finally, we were terribly wrong about RIMAC. It is too big, 
too expensive, and probably will look hideous . Instead, if plan-
ners feel they must cut down those pesky trees, why don't they 
build something useful, like another engineering building, or a 
hospital? Or maybe a hotel. 

Again, we apologize for leading on students and faculty like 
we've done these past months. From now on, we vow to write 
editorials of substance and importance. But maybe not. What the 
hell, we just do this so we can put it on our resumes and pick up 
a little beer money. 

Insensitive Jerks 

Put Down the Seat 
Sexism is rampant in the United States. The vast majority of 

women face sexual harrassment at some time in their lives. One 
of the most critical and common areas of sex ism is in bathrooms. 

Women and men urinate in different positions. That problem 
is intractable. But men can, and should, take responsibility for the 
toilet seat. Men a/ways leave the seat up, causing women to fall 
in, and - in some severe cases - become stuck, requiring 
paramedics to use the "jaws of life" to remove them. 

Some suggest that a solution would be to have both women and 
men put down the lid after they are finished . But in many 
households, a closed lid means that the toilet is clogged. 

This isn ' t a trivial issue. Lucy Jerp eth, of the Women's 
Resource Center, said, "Toilet etiquette is the most critical prob-
lem facing women today. That and child care. And sexist pigs like 
you Guardian editors." 

She's right. Right about the first part, thaI is. Insensitive jerks 
who do not take responsibility for their toilet use should be 
castrated. 

Muir Students: Too Sedated to Care 
Editor: 

As a Muir student, I was 
shocked and appalled when I read 
the lener in the Opinion section of 
the March 5 issue. The question 
of whether or not Muir students 
are morons is moot : we all know 
we have the collective intelligence 
of an eggplant. 

The only debatable observa-
lion is the point Mr. Name With-
held made about Muir students 
being egotistical. 1 doubt it. We're 
usually too stoned, drunk, or trip-
ping too hard to be egotistical or 
sel f righteous. 

It's virtually impossible to be 
egotistical when one is continu-
ally busy vomiting on any given 
floor, on the spiral stairs in Tioga, 
in the elevators, out a seventh 
stdry window, in our HA'scioset, 
etc., etc. And when we're not 
guzzling down a keg, smoking 
some great weed, dropping acid, 
or vomiting in the aforementioned 
locations, we generally sleep. 
Sometimes we go to class, but 
only because it's so funny to watch 
a prof when you're hallucinating. 

Maybe we are egotistical. Who 
wouldn't feel special ifhe did vir-
tually no work, drank as much as 
he could afford, and have no gen-
eral education requirements while 
the rest of you poor stiffs sweat it 
out in the library? I would think 
people would be beating down 
the doors to get into Muir. 

While we're college-bashing, 
let's run down a few peeves I 
happen to have. If any college is 
made up of egocentric morons, 
it's Revelle. Those elitist bastards 
think they're soooo hot, just be-
cause they have a whole mess of 
worthless GE requirements, and 
their GPAs are slightly higher. 
But, while they're hibernating in 
the library, undoubtedly finding 
twisted, sexual pleasure in study-
ing O-Chem and making adoles-
cent mother jokes, we're partying 
it up over here in Tioga. 

1 know where I'd rather be. 
If you thought we Muir stu-

dents were dumb, you haven't 
been over to Third. Any college 
which would even consider call-
ing itself "Lumumba Zapata" 

CAVEIN 

should have been closed immedi-
ately and had all of its students 
round-up and shot. If 1 went to a 
college named " Lumumba 
Zapata," [ 'd definitely want some-
one to hit me several times on the 
head with a 50-pound sledgeham-
mer. And what about Revelle? 
Have you seen those people? 

Whal the hell, [ think we can 
safely say this whole campus is 
made up of schmucks, whiners, 
and losers. All everyone ever does 
here is bitch and moan about how 
parking sucks, and how fees are 
too high, and Atkinson, Watson 
and the boys down in the A.S. are 
a bunch of greedy, uncaring fas-
cists, looking to make students' 
Ii ves hell with their repressive 
alcohol policies, while they enter-
tain fat South African business-
men to $1,000 a plate, 12-martini 

lunches with our tuition and park-
ing money extorted by the slimy 
parking gestapo. 

And the unwashed intellectu-
als down at the Che stand on their 
heads and babble on and on about 
fighting the power, burning coat 
hangers, pulling troops out of 
backwater banana republics, 
screaming for revolution know-
ing full well the UCSD cops are 
going to arrest them, so they bitch 
and moan in the New Incinerator 
that the cops beat the hell out of 
them, when, in fact, they began 
screaming "Fukda po-leece!" and 
started kicking dirt on the cops' 
newly shined shoes. 

Who cares? We shave a few 
pennies, drink, and smoke-out 
anyway. So shut up and have 
another beer.

A Stupid Parking Letter 
Editor: 

Parking isn't any fun. I don't 
like parking. We should make 
parking better. 

The problem wilh parking is 
cars. If we didn ' t have cars, park-
ing wouldn't be nearly so bad. 

Cars are too big. If cars were 
smaller, then parking wouldn't 
suck so bad. Parking permits 
should not be issued to cars bigger 
than a Yugo. I drive a Yugo, and

Who will win ... 

The Vinyl Sho\Vdo\Vn 
By Alan Wilder - Official Hiatus Sex Kitten 

Last week, A.S. In Nine Records Inc. (ASINRI) announced that both John 
Ramirez and Matt Schnurer, two well-known UCSD politicians, were signed onto 
the independent label. In hopes of capturing both the hearts and pocketbooks of the 
college audience, the two artists have released solo albums: RamiTez Live: The 
CultuTal Compilation and SChnUTeT'S TO Showcase. 

The two albums reflect the performers' conflicting views. Their initial animos-
ity originated from a childhood dispute. Attending the same preschool, the two 
young lads made a bet regarding who could get his swing higher. After a close race, 
Schnurer lost his balance, plummeted to the ground, and landed on his head. "I still 
say I was higher," Schnurer grumbled. 

This feud continues today. Kimberly Phillips, ASINRI's vice-president of 
publicity, stated that the opposing views of the two artists will only help boost 
record sales. "Nothing like a good old-fashioned battle of the male egos to increase 
revenue. People love to see public figures make complete asses of themselves." 

This is the first time Ramirez has worked with the ASINRI label. His previous 
work was released on Idiot Vinyl, an underground company well known for its punk 
artists. His latest album, RamiTez Live, meshes together the artist's greatest live 
performances with various spotlighted input from special guests. 

"This is a culturally sensitive album," Ramirez claimed during a recent press 
conference. "I tried to encompass a greater span of entertainment rather than focus 
on what is popular." 

RamiTez Live fails to advance the artist's sound from his previous work. The use 
of producer Tommy Tucker (of Guns 'n Roses fame) might account for the lack of 
progress, but even Ramirez's usual energy on stage is not captured. 

Those who have been fans of Ramirez, all three of them, like the cover photo of 
the album but complain about the lack of musical originality. 

"He's so sexy in those dark suits," fans Betty-Ingrid, Mary-Belle, and Orabella,all 
age 14, babbled. "But, like, what's up with the Outer Mongolian Gregorian 
chanters?" 

The girls refer to the album's somber first single, "Up With People." 
The angst-ridden cut features Ramirez crooning, "You will be culturally 
aware/Because I said so/And I'm omnipotent." Already rising up the 
culturally-sensitive charts, Billbroad's latest update listed the cut as the 
week's hot-shot single, barely nosing out the new Elvis release. 

Other cuts on the album that enter realm of the blase are a cover 
of a Tiffany song titled "I Saw Him/Her{fhey/It Standing There," and 
two cuts, "Do You Know Your Culture?" and "Fact or Fiction", featuring 
Vanness Harris displaying his vast knowledge through music. 

At press time, Harris could not be pulled off his soapbox to comment 
on his involvement with Ramirez's work. Harris was last seen entering 
the Hare Krishna temple in Pacific Beach, mumbling about how "We, 

me, I, they, you, he, she, it, them need to take a stand" against the uncultured 
peasants at UCSD. 

Reinforcing the conflicting musical approaches is the difference in recording 
costs between the two albums. RamiTez Live was a drawn-out affair, taking two years 
and $14 million to complete the album's editing. "Thank goodness for that blank 
check the Parking Office gave me," Ramirez Sighed. 

Schnurer's Showcase , on the other hand, was recorded at KSDT over a drunken, 
haze-filled weekend. The total production cost, including four beer runs, came to 
a total of$28.62. 

"He made a deal with Satan to get this done," said unnamed source Bryanne 
Dazed, cheese editor for the Disreguardian. "But then again, so does everyone in the 
music business." 

Showcase is Schnurer's hodgepodge of hits from bands featured at the TGs. 
Artists, ranging from the eclectic Mojo Nixon to local groups World Peace Posse 
and Cardiff Reefers, dropped by to add their talent to the album. Aided by producer 
EI Ghazalli (of Spinal Tap fame} and engineer James Darlow (of, well, he's not really 
famou ). Schnurer was able to throw together a noble effort. Perhaps the most 
amusing aspect ofthe record is his cover of the PaulAnka hit "My Way," where Red 
Flag croons in the background, "1 don't know why." 

But production workers were not amused while putting the finishing touches on 
the album. "I wish to God he would stop breathing down our necks," one worker was 
overheard complaining. "If he's not wandering aimlessly around here, he's up at the 
GuaTdian telling his life story." 

"Ten minutes of Man Schnurer i hell in itself," Robert Hilburn, senior music 
critic for the Los Angeles Times, said. "Why would I want to pend money to listen 
to 45 minutes of his repetitive babble?" 

Both of these releases can be picked up for a mere pittance next week at Assorted 
Vinyl. Ask for Larry Weintraub; he'll get you a good deal.

Division II Sports 
In UCSD's Future 

Athletic Status To Be Decided This Month 

By BOBBY KNIGHT 
Throwing Chairs 

Though Division I athletics are 
still probably a few years away, the 
move to Division II status became 
a "real possibility" for UCSD ath-
letics as early as Fall 1990, accord-
ing to Bill Gannon, UCSD's sports 
infonnation director.

"I'm really not sure," Gannon 

admitted. "I'mjusttellingyou what 
I've been told. And at this poiht, 
I'm not even sure what I've been 
told." 

Athletic Director Judy Sweet 
was not available for comment, 
but Carolyn Hoffman, the head of 
the intramural program, explained 
that the move to Division II may 
hurt her personal domination over 
all Triton athlete .

Though Gannon said the move

nothing would happen and that, in

Injury-Riddled Tritons 
Capture Monmouth State 
By GARY KARPOROV 
Chess Grandmasters 

In la t week's game against 
Occidental, Triton team leader 
Phegley Aerola broke a finger. 
During practice on Monday , 
bishop-protector Bert Hedgecock 
10 t his glasses. 

And then , right before 
Sunday 's match against the top-
ranked Monmouth State Univer-
ity Nerds, pawn guard Eugene 
Weidermeier stubbed his toe. 

The three top Triton chess-
men - all injured. An easy vic-
tory for the Nerds, right? 

Wrong. 
In a striking display of agility 

and intelligence in the face of 
adversity, UCSD's chessmasters 
broke out of their month-long 
slump to whip MSU in Sunday 's 
doubleheader. 

To Triton Head Coach Albert 
Shenk, the victories, bringing 
UCSD's record to 2-8, were the 
result of a long-anticipated trans-
formation. 

"I don 't know who that team 
was in our unifonns for the first 
eight games, but it wasn ' t the 
team I saw today," Shenk said, 
obviously pleased. 

"From the first pawn move to 
the last checkmate, we showed 
those Nerds how to play chess. 
As far as we're concerned today 
was opening day," he said. 

The game began slowly, as 
Hedgecock surprised the crowd 
by utilizing the rare Chula Vista 
Opening. 

"It seemed like a good idea at 

the time," Hedgecock said in the 
locker room after the game. 

The Nerds countered with the 
dreaded Poway defense, but were 
soon beaten back by a series of 
daring Triton moves, including a 
king's-side castling and a 
surprising en passant maneuver. 

"After the en passan!, they 
had nowhere to run," Shenk said. 

The second game was more 
grueling, as the Nerds started with 
the explosive Chemobyl Open-
ing, which gained glowing re-
views from Shenk. 

"That was a brilliant strategy," 
Shenk said. "It almost blew us 
away." 

But the Tritons recovered late 
in the game, as Aerola led an ag-
gressive end run on the Nerds' 
queen with only I: 10 left to play. 

"We figured it was either do 
ordie at that point," Weidermeier 
said, nursing his sore toe. 

According to Shenk, Weider-
meier was the star of the day. 

"He's overcome the mental 
lapses and inconsistency that hurt 
him earlier in the year," Shenk 
said. "[Weidermeier) has finally 
gotten it through his head that 
bishops don' t go straight." 

Other Triton standouts were 
Hedgecock (with a 4-to-9 pieces 
taken ratio on the year) and Aerola 
(.63 2 check-checkmate average). 

The Tritons face a tough op-
ponent this weekend when they 
play the Corn State (Kansas) 
Teaching Assistants. UCSD will 
then travel to Orlando, Rorida to 
face the Orange University Engi-

HOME EVENTS IN BOLD CAPS 

Padres to Hold Final Week of 
Spring Training at UCSD'sField 
Apr. 7 Triton/Claremont-Mudd Game at Jack Murphy 

By CHRIS BROWN 
Benched In Milwaukee 

In a surprising move, San Di-
ego Padres management and the 
UCSD athletic department agreed 
late last night that the Padres would 
hold their remaining workouts and 
spring training games at UCSD's 
baseball field. beginning today with 
a 1 p.m. game against the Cleve-
land Indians. 

Because the Tritons have a 
scheduled Apr. 7 home game with 
Claremont-Mudd and the Padres 
will need UCSD's field that day, 
the Padres agreed to let the Divi-
sion III contest be played at Jack 
Murphy Stadium. 

"I'm really excited about play-
ing in Jack Murphy Stadium," 
Triton Head Coach Lyle Yates said. 
"I also hope that the Padres ' pres-
ence on our field will rub off on 
us." 

UCSD, currently 12-10 and 
ranked 11th nationally, does not 
have any scheduled home games 
this week until Saturday. The Tri-

tons ' regularly scheduled practices 
will be moved to the softball field 
for the week, while the softball 
team will be returned to its old 
habitat, the Jewish Community 
Center. 

The Padres, who held spring 
training in Yuma, Arizona, were 
forced to relocate when they dis-
covered Yuma management had 
already rented out the stadium be-
ginning Apr. 2 to the local team, 
well before 1990. Because of the 
baseball lockout, which pushed 
opening day one week past its 
scheduled date (which would have 
been today), the Padres were re-

quired to find different quarters to 
finish their spring preparation for 
the 1990 season. According to 
sources close to the Padre organi-
zation, UCSD was a viable alter-
native because its field has the 
same turf as Jack Murphy Sta-
dium. 

The Padre players will arrive by 
chartered bus today at 10 a.m. to 
their temporary residences at Pep-
per Canyon Apartments. The 
Padres will not be the first profes-
sional team to hold practice at 
UCSD - the Chargers hold their 
training camp on UCSD's North 
Recreation Area Fields during the 
summer. 

Despite the Padres ' arrival , 
some UCSD students, particularly 
Triton players, were not impressed. 

Dann Eaton, a pitcher for the 
Tritons, was one of those players. 

"Who cares?" Eaton said. 
"Everybody's making such a big 
deal about [holding spring training

Perhaps the Padres' occupance of UCSO's baseball field during the Tritons' road trip will have a 
favorable effect on UCSO's ballclub. Well ... perhaps not.
