The Decl i ne of Activism: Part III 
John Taylor 

When UCSD students arrived on 
campus for the 1%9-1970 school year, 
Richard Nixon's promise of a "secret 
plan" for peace in Indochina was nearly a 
year old. 29,000 more men of collqe age 
were drafted that October, compared to 
13,800 during the same month in 1968 
[and compared to 25,900 in June, and the 
month the President announced that 
troop cutbacks were to begin.] 

Also, on September 19, the Rqents 
directed UC president Charles Hitch "to 
take steps to terminate Miss [Angela] 
Davis' University appointment [as an 
assistant professor of philosophy at 
UCLA] in accordance with rqular 
procedures as prescribed in the Standing. 
Orders of the Regents." Their resolution 
followed receipt by the Regents of a 
letter from Ms. Davis in which she ad-
mitted membership in the Communist 
Party. 

And finally, Governor Reagan, stating 
"every state agency has fat that can be 
trimmed," recommended a 5289 millioh 
budget to the Reaents for the University. 

Hitch had told the board UC needed 5374 
million to continue its present growth. 

Thus, the potential for student 
"unrest" was significant. That potential 
was fully realized during the 1969-1970 
school year, the subject of this article, 
the third of a four-part series on activism 
at UCSD. 

In September of the year before, 
Eldridge Cleaver, who was at the time 
under fire from the Regents as a result of 
his . lecturing at Berkeley in a social 
analysis course, addressed an anxious 
group of students in the gym . The next 
year, 1969, saw Angela Davis, in equal 
disfavor with the Regents, address 
members of the community on the 
Revelle plaza. Her speech followed 
condemnation by the UCLA and UCSD 
Academic Senates of the Regents' action 
against her . 

As Cleaver's speech had begun a 
preoccupation with the actions of the 
Regents, Davis' address marked the end 
of it. for although concern for the ac-
tions of the UC governing body would 
continue throughout the year with 
opposition to tuition and a few other

issues,. the efforts of the mass of activists 
turned toward the escalating war in 
Vietnam . 

October 15 marked the first National 
Vietnam Moratorium Day .. Speakers at 
the day-long rally included Revelle 
Provost (r1ow Vice-Chancellor) Paul 
Saltman, ph ilosophy professor Herbert 
Marcuse (whose continued presence on 
campus owed to Chancellor McGill's 
courageous trickery of the year before), 
and several otner members of the 
faculty . 

The day before the moratorium, two 
UCSD students had announced intent to 
turn in their draft cards, while a member 
of the Air Force burned his military 10 
card on the campus. Upon leaving, he 
was arrested and handed over to the 

Shore Patrol . (It was noted that he had 
been AWOL for 37 days) All three stated 
their opposition to the war mach ine, and 
the "process of dehumanization which 
makes men into blind killers of their 
fellowmen ." 

During the same week , In a poll In 
which 37 percent of UCSD and UCLA 
tudents participated, Angela Davis was 

supported against the Regents nearly 
nine to one. In the same poll , 79 percent 
of the UCSD students responding stated 
their disfavor with the war in Vietnam, 
and supported immediate troop with-
drawls . It was an ' impressive indication of 
a concern that, trengthened later by 
events international and local, built to a 
climax in the spring of that year .

St. Valentine's Day Massacre 
This Saturday, February 2, from noon until midnight 

at 1102 Tioga Hall, the Tr i ton Wargam.ing Society wi ll 
hold its annual St. Valentine's Day Massacre. 

Although t he TWS does not expect a surprise ap-
pearance by Scarface or any other derelict characters of 
American gangland fame, certain derel ict and grandiose 
figures from days of yore and now will indeed be 

. present, if .in spirit only . 

For instance, republ ican despots can glory over the 
exploits of Napoleon I, National So cial ists can once and 
for all attempt to elim inate the miasma of Bolshevism 
from the earth before M oscow (or vice versa) and 
Palestinian National ists can solve the question of Israel 
ad infinitum (or vice versa) . 

Accord ing t o james C . Soto, Presi dent and resident 
romantic of the Society, " This month's orgy promises to 
be the most devastating yet." 

Senate to Okay Women 
Senator Nicholas C. Petris (D-Oakland) today an-

nounced the approval by the State Senate's judiciary 
Committee of his measure to recognize that sex 
discrimination in public accomodations is unlawful. 

The Petris bill would add to the Unruh Act, which 
allows civil damages for discriminatiqn by proprietors of 
business enterprises, specific reference to sex 
discrimination . 

The Unruh Act applies to most rental housing, since 
rental units offered to the public are deemed public 
accommodations. A recent decision of the California 
Supreme Cour' held that the Unruh Act forbids 
discrimination f )r'\ any arbitrary basis . The effect of the 
Petris bill wowd be to clarify the law by adding sex 
discrimination a~ an " i lIustration" of the types of 
discrimination I hat might be considereG arbitrary under 
the circumstan r.es . 

M s. Maxin Brown, chairperson of the Statewide 
Housing Task l o rce for the National Organizat ion of 
Women, testif ied to the existence of unjustified 
d iscrimination by landlords agai nst single women, 
including divo rcees and widows. 

The legislat ion was also supported by the WQmen 
Lawyers' Associat ion of Los Angeles and the State Bar of 

alifornia . 

The measure now goes to the Senate f loor, wh re It is 
expected to be brought up for , vote wlthtn the week 

"To me It is a question of justice for d:! Wh<>n we 
teach that goal we Will no 10ngPr be troubleci !w ,lr 
bitrary discriminalton a to any group, " Sencltor Pc>t rt 
observed . 

Freshmen Seminars: 
A Different 

Educational Approach 
by Roberta Rehm 

Twenty-three "Freshman Seminars" were held fall 
quarter for the first time at UCSD. Chancellor William 
McElroy originated the idea of the seminars which had 
two primary purposes . One was to integrate incoming 
students into the university community in a personal, 
academically valuable way. The other was to introduce 
freshmen to the world of university research . 

According to Dr. Paul Saltman, Vice Chancellor of 
Academic Aftairs, "It's a chance to get acquainted, sort 
of to make a focal point contact with a person in a field 
that may be of interest ." 

Chancellor McElroy invited faculty and student 
participation in letters sent last summer and stressed the 
purely voluntary nature of the non-credit seminars. 109 
freshmen participated during the fall quarter and 44 are 
still involved in groups that decided to extend their 
seminars into the winter quarter. 

Saltman stated, "To the best of my knowledge, the 
response of the faculty who taught it was a joyous one. 
They very much liked th~ students who came in. In 
talking to a tew of the students who participated, they 
seemed to like it a great deal also." 

Dr. Dennis Fox, professor emeritus, who taught a 
seminar on " Coloration in the animal kingdom", stated, 
"The students were brighteyed, well dressed, respectful 
and really wanted to learn something." 

Dr. Roy Pearce, Dean of Graduate Studies, stated, " I 
enjoyed myself." Dr. Pearce plans to meet with his 
group later this quarter to follow up on his seminar that 
one titled, " Poetry: New, Newer, Newes!." 

A few problems developed during the course of the 
seminars . One was presenting highly technical material 
at a level that freshmen with little or no background 
could understand. Another was that of encouraging full

UC Suffers '74 
Million Stock Loss 

While the nation 's 
financial investments lost 
ground during the latter 
part of 1973, the University 
of Californ ia suffered a $ 74 
million paper loss in 
common stock holdings. 

During the period from 
October 29, 1973 to january 
11, 1974, the UC Investment 
Portfolio showed the value 
of common stocks owned 
by the University plunging 
16 per cent. 

The University holds 
shares in 77 common stocks 
listed on the New York 
Stock Exchange. Of these, 
71 declined and only five 
gained ., 

Profit on the five winners 
ranged from Southern 
Pacific Railroad which 
gained S433,954 to Cyprus 
Mines which raked in a 
meager S60. 

On the down side of the 
ledger, International 
Business Mach ines, th e 
highest valued common 
stock in the Portfolio at $24 
million, lost $4.5 million. 
Caterpillar Tractor with a 
value of 513.9 million to the 
University, fell $3.8 million . 

Standard Oil of Ohio lost 

another $4.1 million during 
the two and a half month 
period . 

Dollar values of 
University Stocks were 
arrived at in the last official 
audit at the end of the 1973 
fiscal year. On june 30, 
1973 University common 
stock assets totaled $467 
million : This figure will be 
adjusted again on june 30 
this year to register the 
above losses and gains. 

Since the stock losses are 
on paper, the actual loss of 
money would not be 
recorded until the stock is 
sold. 

The paper val ue of the 
entire Portfolio changes 
daily along with the market. 
With a rise in over all stock 
market profits, the Portfolio 
losses of the past year could 
be diminished. 

Compared to other stock 
indexes the University fared 
slightly poorer. The Dow 
jones . 30 Industrials 
declined 14.55 per cent 
during the same two and a 
half month period .

The French Collection 

The French language has the reputation of being the 
most romantic language in the world. This, obviously, is 
a spurious rumor-no doubt started by the French . About 
the only people who believe it are the French . Anyone 
else who believes it probably hasn't the brain capacity 
to perform the autonomic functions without conscious 
effoit. These people are halfway to being French . All 
they lack is another accident of birth and a brick in their 
mouths . 

French has the added distinction of being thought of 
as a beautiful language. The subtle hand of the French is 
evident in this regard also. It's easy to see how this one 
got started. When a country has no other justification 
for its continued existence, it can always claim that its 
language is better than others. . 

As we all know, this is not so. In fact, the French 
language rates somewhere between cave painting and 
war as 'In effective means of communication . 

Is it mere coincidence that the first cave paintings 
were discovered in France, or was it God's joke on that 
country? Many people know of the existence of these 
caves. What most people don't realize is that these . 
paintings were not the work of some primitive culture, 
but were the product of France's Golden Age. (They 
thought it was gold, anyway. It's turning green now and 
they're trying to sell it for scrap .) Another point to keep 
in minp is that while these paintings were made, French, 
as a spoken and written language, existed in a form 
similar to the language now mumbled in France. The 
main difference is that the old Qne was better. Even at 
that, the cave paintings bear witness to which form of 
communication those ancient Frenchmen thought 
would leave a better impression on posterity . And just 
to do the job right, all printed material was burned . 

This act was not a hasty one, but one which was well 
thought out and skillfully executed . Modern France 
would do well to emulate the example set by their wiser 
ancestors. 

I have here with me a copy of Larousse's French-
English, English-French dictionary. This book was 
written in France and published by Pocket Books of 
New York. It is on sale at the university bookstore. 
Admittedly, it is not the definitive work on the French: 
language (if such is possible). Yet a more complete. 
dictionary would only provide me with more examples ' 
to give you . 

At a recent discussion on the cons of French, I picked , 
up this dictionary and paged through it at random . The 
only times I paged in sequence was when I hit upon 
hotbeds of stupidity. As you will see, this was not a rare 
occurrence. 

The point of this was to find words that were 
pronounced alike, if not spelled alike, and which had 
separate meanings. I found fourteen such examples 
before I got bored . I can't reproduce the diacritical 
markings used to aid pronunciation but a quick check of 
the Larousse outrage will prove that the following words 
are indeed pronounced the same. The English meanings 
are in parentheses. And to those who scream "out of 
context,", let is be remembered that Lt . Calley's defense 
asked the jury to consider his acts "in the context of the 
Vietnam War." 
1. golf (golf) - golfe (gulf) p . 1.50 
2. grele(slender) - grele(hail) p.151 
3. guere(scarcely) - guerre(war) p. 153 
4. peche(peach) - peche(fishing) p. 201 
5. pensee(pansy) - pensee(opinion) p. 202

13. binette(hoe) - binette(face) p . 52 
14. nu(naked) - nue(high clouds) p . 192 

This last example speaks volumes about the French . 
Someone is talking about the weather and this other guy, 
is desperately searching the landscape for nudes. Maybe 
this is the basis of the typically French belief in their 
amatory superiority. Too many people talking about the 
weather. At any rate, if a person really wanted to know 
what dismal lovers Frenchmen are, he should ask french , 
women . Theirs is another story indeed. Once again, the 
hand of the Frenchman - and precious little else - would 
be plain to see. 

Yes, the French language is romantic if you don't 
know what Romance language mean . And it's beautiful 
if en orimotor muttering strikes your fancy. But If you 
like to make sense in your conversation and like to 
und r~tand others in thpirs. I rPllch i~n ' t for you

Candy Companies' Policy: "Let Them' Eat Cotton"

Wi th th e recent increase 
In the price of candy bars, it 
should be of undoubtable 
Interest to andy bar buyers 
that th e content of 
chocolate In many candies 
has decreased and, in some

curtailments and with 
finding ways to conserve 
energy. The task force will 
study possible goals for 
levels of energy usage, 
procedures and policies for 
procuring fuels, and 
budgetary implications 
resulting from the rising 
cost of fuels and changing 
patterns of energy usage. 
Attention also will be given 
to the of 

design criteri a for con-
struction o f new building 
to minimi ze energy con -

Donuts and 
Chattering Teeth 

FILM: Brandon Wander 

If you haven't seen The 
Sting by now and are 
searc hing for a nice, bland, 
entertaining flick to take a 
date to on Friday night, 
make a note in your 
datebook . The " But ch 
Cassidy" rematch of 
Newman and Robert 
Redford has the same sweet 
moves as before, but hyped-
up quite a bit by a now-you-
see-it-now-you-don ' t script 
by David S. Ward . The 
entire movie has a 
Hollywood glaze, whose 
slickness drips into crass, 
particularly with the music . 
Riding a revival of Scott 
Joplin music - a sharp 
economic calculation - the 
tinny honky-tonk rag "The 
Entertainer" is jazzed down 
with strings and a punk 
piccolo. 

Another lure of this 
movie is Robert Shaw, who 
got his start in "From RUlsia 
With Love" as 007's blond 
bummer, hit with flying 
colors in "The Hirelinl", 
and went right into the 
Hollywood buzzsaw . The 
buzzsaw cut off his acting 
abili ty with his head, 
leaving plenty of vocal 
chords eX~0sed for h is role 
as th e to·be-duped 
gangster. 

Other than that, Paul 
Newman looks good, 
Robert Redford looks good, 
director George Roy Hill 's 
Hollywood future looks 
good , and producer Zanuck 
the Younger's pocketbook 
looks very good. After being 
a yo-yo for two hours, a 
surprise ending springs on 
your yo-yoed brain. You 
leave with your date smiling 
and drained, and begin 
making plans to return next 
Friday and keep score of the 
little hints you missed. But 
if you're looking for traces 
of conceptual originality, 
art, what have you, you' ll 
find it in the center of this 
movie. Oh , by the way, the 
movie is a donut. 

Sleeper has great music , 
and tapping your foot is a 
great American pastime. 
Woody Allen plays his 
clarinet with a trio of 
Dixieland Bands and 
generally has a good time . 

The plot of the movie, a 
Greenwich health store 
owner being revived from 
deep-freeze after 200 years 
because of peptic ulcer, is 
tenuous at best. But who 
cares about plot? The jabs, 
one-liners, the elaborate 
funky sets right out of 
"Things to Come" (1939) are 
unpretentious . 

The department of music 
at UCSD is presenting "A 
Concert of New Music With 
Somebody and Somebody's 
Friend," Friday, February 8, 
at 8:30 pm in 409, Matthews 
Campus . 

The program emphasizes 
contemporary work s by 
contemporary composels 
based on research in new 
sources of sound and sound 
techniques as applied 
particularly to the clarinet 
and percussion instruments. 
"Flowers, Bells, 
Migrations," by Susan 
Palmer, UCSD Music 
Department graduate 
student, is a type of mobile 
piece for clarinet, bass 
clarinet and various per· 
cussion instruments. It is a 
premiere performance of 
the composition written for 
Joan George, clarinet and 
Ron George, percussion. 

Annual Youth Talent COlllpetition What is happening here is a film link with tradition . 
Visual gags pay homage to 
Chaplin, sex puns have a 
burlesque flavor, and Allen 
even includes a stand-up 
comic but - a scientist 
straig ht man asks t h e 
questions and Allen plays 
his foil. "Here's a picture of 
a man (Nixon) who we think 
may have been a President 
of t he United States, but 
who committed some 
horrendous act to which all 
records of h is existence 
were destroyed ... " 

Robert Erickson's "Loops" 
was begun as a special 
research project in the 
UCSD Center for Music 
Experiment by the com· 
poser and Ron George, 
fellow in the Center . The 
aim was to develop a solo 
percussion work based on 
Mr. Erickson's research in 
instrument ca lled "per· 
cussion console" because 
of its sim ilarity to the organ 
console . He will perform an 
improvised version of 
"Loop." "Mosaics" by W.O . 
Smith is one of the earl y 
works using ext ended 
techniques for the clarinet. 
Mr. Smith is a member of 
the mu ic faculty at the 
University of Washington in 
Sea~tle .

Tales From Topographic Oceans 
Yes. Atlimtic SO 2-908 

While one could say that the music of the sixties was 
marked by identifiable patterns of development (the 
50's music of early sixties, the " group" development of 
rock, the electric guitar as the basis for everything), the 
70's thus far have been a maze of musical mishap, with 
no set directions defined . 
With the re-emergence of the "solo" artist, as com-

pared to the "group" format (as begun by the breakup of 
the " Beatles", " Cream", Crosby, Stills, Nash , and Young, 
and so many others), and with those remaining groups 
groping for a musi ca l foothold amid the Ali ce Cooper 
rock-theatre concept, the E,L. & P high energy concept, 
the heavy- teel acid rock remnants, and nostalgia buffs, 
the music world is ripe for a direction to proceed in . 

With Tales of Topographic Oceans, "Yes" may have 
laid down the initial pavement for a new route in music . 
H re is an a lbum taking the basic instrumental and 
voca l components of rock music and transcending it 
into nearly symphonic form . All the potential that had 
been surroundin g the bands previous albums has at last 
ripened and m atured. 

The double a lbum is one long pi ce actually, with one 
movement on each side . It is designed to dea l with the 
four part shastri c scriptures which Jon Anderson says in 
hi liner notes "Cover all a pects of religion and social 
l ife as well as fields like medicine and music, art and 
architecture." 

Now as for this concept of the album, I leave it to the 
more ~tudious to analyze how each movement t,ies in 
With the theme, but whatever its inspiration , th result is 
magnificent. 
The thing that makes this album such a milestone in 

Musical Notes 
progressive rock is the amazing sense of structure it 
possesses . Unlike the majority of groups in the music 
scene today, " Yes" is not a band of soloists . The music is 
carefully arranged so as to create a total sound, not 
unlike the effect of a symphony orchestra in which all 
the instruments work to produce the whole. 
Here is Rick Wakeman's amazing array of synthesizers, 

mellotrons, organs, and other keyboards, along with 
Steve Howe's versatile guitar playing, working in and 
out of one another so as to produce an unseparable 
whole. The same is true with bassist Chris Squire, and 
drummer Alan White. During the fourth movement, 
Ritual, there is an incredible passage in which an 
otherwise traditional percussion solo is enhanced by 
syntheSizer and bass produ ing an almost terrifying 
effect, 

As in most all "Yes" albums, the lyrics are relatively 
obscure, but they serve as the shaped notes for Jon 
Anderson's voice, as he floats in and out of instrumental 
passages . The words become very much a part of the 
tota l composition, another instrument of the band, 
another facet of the total composition 
There is no doubt that the accessibility of this album is 

to be questioned. The movements (If not the whole 
piece) really need to be listened to as a whole, and so 
the album will hardly receive a lot of radio air play . And 
by the same token , it isn't the art of album you can just 
slip on and sing along with . The work is undeniably 
complex. 

But therein lies its contribution . Perhaps this album 
will serve as the forerunner for a true symphonic rock , 
compo it ions of some depth and breadth that exceed 
the limitations of three chord twelve bar progressions.

Contert Notes 

A fine evening of jazz is 
yours to enjoy this 
weekend. On Sunday night, 
Feb. 3, the U.C.S .D . Campus 
Program Board and KSDT, 
In conj unction with 
California Concerts, will 
present Hungarian jazz 

guitarist' Gabor Szabo and 
Return to Forever featuring 
Chick Corea in a special San 
Diego engagement. 

Cabor Szabo , the 
renowned guitarist, will be 
making his second San 

DieltO appearance (he 
performed last summer on a 
bill with Freddie Hubbard) . 
Szabo is acclaimed by 
critics as one of the most 
imdginative and technically 
brilliant of today's solo jazz 
guitarists . Previous 
associations have j .. cluded 
Wes Montgomery, Johnny 
Smith, Charles Lloyd, Cary 
M crarland , and Ch ico 
Hamilton . Working 
together with bassist 
Wolfgang Melz and John 
Dentz, Szabo's mUSIC is a 
shimm erin g col lage of 
Eastern European Latin, 
and I ndian influences, 
combined with touches of 
sheer imagery . 

Return to Forever with 
Chick Corea has been 
hailed as one of the most 
eXCiting new groups to 
emerge in the wave of "New 
Jazz." The members, Lenny 
White (drum l. Stan Clarke 
(bass), Bill Conners (guitar), 
and Chick Corea (piano), 
unite to create a total 
musical concept. As Corea 
states, " It's music that 
comes from a love for the 
way everybody in the band 
creates ... when we play 
music, we create a par-
ticular kind of space fa r 
people to be in ... " 

At 7:30 Sunday night, the 
U.C.S.D. Gym will certai nly 
be a fine space to be in . 
Tickets are available at the 
Urey Hall Box Office, 
today, and at the door 
Sunday night. 

Music: Oassics in Review Ch~rles Hyde 
Last Sunday the Young 

Concert Artists Series of the 
Campus Programming 
Board continued with Jean-
Jacques Kantorow, violin . 
Perhaps it was the day of 
the week or the time of the 
quarter, but this fine 
violinist played before an 
embarrassingly small , if 
justifiably appreciative, 
audience at the Revelle 
Cafeteria. I hope that future 
concerts can draw larger 

receptions; from the quality 
of the performance to date 
(and the price!) they well 
deserve it. 

one, and a practice that will 
be hopefully repeated by 
other arti sts . 

His program, as well as 
hi s accompanist, was all 
French . It was very well 
played, although it con-
centrated on romantic 
music (then again, so did 
the French, I guess). 

Of particular interest at 
this concert was at in-
termission , when M . 
Kantorow entertained 
questions from the 
audience concerning the 
life of a .young musi cian or 
anything else . This is an 
excellent addition to an 
informal concert as this 

The next concert in this 
series is March 3, and will 
feature Jonathan 
Abramowitz; cellist. 

Jewish Book Month 

Do Books Have Meaning? 
The Jewish Community Center 

Samuel & Rebecca A tor Judaica library -
will present San Diego's foremost literary 
critic and lecturer, Mrs. Abraham 
Nasatir . This event will take place on 
Sunday, February 31974 at 7:30 p .m. at 
the Jewish Community Center - 4079 _ 
54th SI. San Diego. 

Mrs. Nasatir will render thumb-nail 
portraits of the following five books; and 
in depth analysis of the last two titles 
listed. 

AND PERHAPS by Ruth Dayan and 
Helga Dudman : this is a moving and 
intimate portrait of a remarkab le woman 
coming to terms with life - "where the 
price of living with a legend ca n be too 
great , and where charisma vanishes at 
the breakfast table." 

IN ONE ERA AND OUT THE OTHER by 
Sam Levenson: "Laughter and chuckles 
are good for the soul ," says Mrs. Nasatir. 

FOR THOSE I LOVED by Martin Gray : 
a compelling autobiographical no~el 
which takes place during the Warsaw 
Uprising. 

REMBRANDT'S HAT by Bernard 
Malamud : Mr . Malamud's late t 
co llection of hart stories . 

THE OATH by Elie Wiesel : "What 
would you say to a young stranger who 
wishes to die?" " What arguments would 
you use to restore his will to live." "What 
ideas & ideals would you invoke to sav 
him?" 

IN THE DAYS of Simon Stern by Arthur 
A . Cohen's fierce and eloquent npw 
novel, Mr. Cohen recounts the life and

OPINION 
~4.merican Roulette Setting: the oval office in the White Hou~p Nixon sits alone at his desk. 

When was the lasl time that 

You or your family was bankrupted or 
thrown into lifelong debt by medical 
e)(penses from an illness or injury that 
simultaneously destroyed your 
livelihood. 

You were unable to get any medical 
insurance at all because the companies 
deCided that you were likely to need it. 

You were unable to get a job because 
your employers were afraid that people 
like you might drive up their group rates . 

Your wages were attached and you lost 
your job because you couldn't pay a 
hospital bill . 

The loopholes in your fancy policy left 

you with thousands in debts. 
You waited in pain for five hours to see 

a doctor at a charity hospital because 
you were too poor to afford decent 
service. 

A member of your family died- while 
being denied admittance to a private 
hospital. 

A friend of yours became seriously ill 
because he hadn't gotten a regular 
check-up because they cost so much. 

You heard the president of the AMA 
explain how socialized medicine would 
destroy the quality of medical care, while 
you lay dying in the gutter. 

Oh, really? None of these things has 
happened to you? Still in good health? 
Well , keep your fingers crossed. 

NIXON: 
Surrounded by my enemies, 
Abetted by the left-wing masses, 
Who try to Dring me to my knees, 
Deserted by the middle classes, 
I well can see how Christ felt now, 
With crown of thorns upon his brow. 
Bearing the cross for humanity 
Up to the mount of Calvary. 
His faith in golden rule and love, 
(A message I am sure well meant, 
Although it had a left-wing bent), 
Allied him less with hawk than dove. 
It was this love of peace by Christ, 
That lead to his so young demise. 

lance had here a flock of hawks, 
Of eagles, falcons, peregrines, 
Now some are cag-ed behind locks, 
And some turned out the 'singing kinds. 
But yet it is quite evident,

Dear Mr. McCarty: 

This letter is about abortion . Abortion 
is not a subject to be fI ippant about. It is 
a complex issue and does not lend itself 
to satire - even a competent satirist 
would hesitate to use that form to deal 
with such a difficult topic . 

Women between the ages of 13-55, of 
any color or class or nationality, married 
or not, may at some time face the 
deCision to end a pregnancy. There are as 
many reasons for such a chOice as there 
are women making the choice. The 
choice might have to be made because 
of lack of birth control information, use 
of faulty birth control devices, loss of a 
livelihood, (the woman's or her partners) 

serve the interests of the community 
rather than those of the developers. If 
you would like to register for this

According to the United States 
Supreme Court decision of January 22,

the first 0 months of pregnancy. 

Articles like Mark McCarty's (alias 
Hieronymous Hoover) do nothing to help 
women personal/y or enlighten 
philosophic, religious or legal discussions 
of the issue. The article may generate 
heat but no light on the subject. Con-
troversy for its own sake may be jour-
nalistically A..()K, but using women in 
this flippant, uncaring way is merely 
blatant sexism.

Pope Paul broke several precedents 

Monday by inducting into sainthood 
Hank Steiman, a Muir junior. It is the first 
time that a person has been canonized 
while still alive. It is also the first time 
that an unconverted Jew has received 
such an honor. The Pope said that by this 
action he was "s ignalling to our lewish 
brethren the need for a unified world 
community, and showing young people 
that religion and religious action are very 
much alive and relevant." He explained 
that the selection of Mr. Steiman was due 
to Hank's "chastity, godliness , and love 
of animals, and the miracles which he 
performs daily ." The official name which 
Steiman will bear is "St . Hank of the 
Oranges," due to his love for that pic-
turesque fruit .

NIXON : 
Oh! for that world that might have been, 
With followers more confident, 
Who unlike counselor John Dean, Refu~ed to stab their President. 
But, one request I ask of you . 
I know that this will see us through . 
It happened several years ago, 
As I am certain you all know. 
The New Nixon sat in this chair. 
He played at being "Mr. Clean", 
And did not want me to be seen. 
He kept me in the closet there. 
My only work, a speech or two, 
I wrote for our Spiro Agnew. 

NIXON [continues) : 
But then I was aSSigned mor.e work , 
And formed th'e Plumbers Unit so, 
To kidnap every left·wing jerk , 
And ship them off to Mexico. 
My other self stood in my way, 
So he was first to go that day. 
I'm sure my plan just cannot fail. 
He's still inside the Juarez jail. 
If you can bring him back to here, 
And if you will let me go free, 
And substitute this man for me, 
Our problems all will disar.pear. 

BUZHARDT : 
This other Nixon never lead 
a life except within your head. 

(Buzhardt and Garment walk out leaving Nixon alone.) 

When contacted about his honor, 
Hank at first feigned incomprehension . 
"Canonized? Is that anything like San-
forized? Or is that what Quaker Oats 
does to that stuff that's "shot from guns?" 
But realization finally dawned. "Gee," he 
quipped, " that makes me rather unique. I 
must be the first saint that uses Ban RoII -
On Where do I get my halo? Is it free?" 

Hank's jovial inanity is well known to 
many UCSD students. "I love to spread 
joy to the people I meet, especially 
pretty girls." less well known are the 
amazing miracles which so impressed the 
Pope. "Oh, I know. Once I walked into 
the Muir TV room while a movie was on 
and there wasn't a commercial for thirty 
minutes after that. Or sometimes when I 
get in the cafeteria line it seems to speed 
up. But other times it slows down " 

Hank's good deeds are a legend among 
students . Besides his well-known 
championship of McGovern during the 
abortive 72 campaign, Hank has been 
the motive power behind many lesser 
known efforts . " I started a petition drive 
asking President Nixon to choose 
McGovern as his new vice-president. I've 
established a Hank Steiman Home For 
Homeless Girls in my room . I'm also 
working on a movement to legalize 
incest in San Diego. We're having a 

Hank has numerous hobbies. " I play 
my ocarina for my friends My favorite 
tunes are 'Jesus Wats Me For A Sun-
beam,' 'Happy Days are Here Again,' and 
'Baby, let Me Bang Your Box ' I have 
many other musical interests , like for 
example I like to give free organ lessons 
to girls . Another of my hobbies is 
collecting Spiro Agnes memorabilia 
Like I have the sock that he was wearing 
on his fight foot when he made hiS 
famous " fat Jap" remark I took it to a 
friend of mine who does biochemistry 
and he proved that it had saliva on It 
Also I have lots 0 1 Spiro posters and 
stickers and watches and spitoons " 

The highlight of Hank 's day was a 
congratulatory phone call from PreSident 
Nixon: " Hank, I want to commend you 
for your saintliness and outstand ing 
moral rect itude Pat and Julie and Tricla 
and Bob and John and I wish you only 
the best Now when will it be convenient 
for you to come to your crucifixion? Ha . 
Ha That was only a joke." Hank an-
swered " Ha. Ha. That joke was almost a~ 
funny 'as the one about the million 
dollars , Mr. President. It's wonderful to 
know that you would talk to mere or-
dinary people such as myself on an 
ordinary telephone . Gee, I'm really 
honored and flattered, and could I ask a 
favor . I've always wanted to play

logy At UCSD 

avid Durkin 

Based upon casu31 observations, one would probably 
surmise that the basic problem within the SOciology 
department at U.C.S.D. is that of unusually large classes 
caused by a short- ge 01 professors and a concurrent 
situation of student overcrowding. The almost universal 
student and faculty acceptance of an explanation such 
as this has served only to cloud over the one critical 
failing which has reduced U.C.S.D. sociology to a study 
in frustration, rather than a study of society. An ex-
tremely narrow emphasis on ethnomethodology, the 
"pet" theory of nearly all professors and department 
heads, is the real source of confusion and disillusion-
ment among sociology majors . Curriculum content, not 
class size, is the crux of discontent . If students feel that 
a given class is important in developing their un-
derstanding of the world around them, then the ratio of 
professor to student b~omes an irrelevant statistic. 

I think it is fair to say that most sociology majors at 
U.C.S .D. originally entered the field with the hope of 
developing their ability to understand American social 
problems in order to make our society a better place in 
which to live. Only by comprehending the social 
mechanisms behind racism, sexism, poverty, war, and 
explOitation , can one aspire to make those changes 
which are necessary if America is to become a just and 
equitable society. Unfortunately, the U .C. S.D. sociology 
department has sacrificed tHe development of such an 
understanding in favor of advancing the theory of 
ethnomethodology. 

'NOW, I COULD lAY THAT WORDI .AIL MI, aUT '"AT WOULD.I THIDIY WAY OUT .... 

I do not mean to imply by the above comments that a 
study of ethnomethodology is without value. Such a 
statement would most certainly be arrogant and naive 
on my part . Gaining an understanding of how different 
groups and individuals socia lly construct their own 

~ealities , a fundamental concept of ethnomethodology, 
IS absolutely essential in breaking down those barriers of 
communication which are at the base of so many social 
problems. But a limited idea such as this cannot be all 
encompassing. Nor should it be all important. 
Ethnomethodology should be studied as only one IIf 
many important SOCiological concepts. Sadly, U .C.S.D. 
has chosen to commit an entire department to the 
promotion of this theory. Ethnomethodology has 
become the SOCiological "sacred cow" of this university. 

If the U.C.S.D. sociology department is to become a 
productive force in contributing to the solution of 
America 's socia l problems, certain changes should be 
made One of these c hanges must involve the de-
emphasis of ethnomethodology. Perh aps we should 
consider reading a little more of John Kenneth 
Galbraith, Charles Silberman, Margaret Mead, Ger-
maine Greer and Eldridge Cleaver, and a little less of 
Erving Goffman, Harold Garfinkel, and Carlos 
Casteneda. In troubled times such as thiS, we can't allow 
ourselves to wallow in the sometimes stagnent morass 
of ethnomethodo logy.

You must be very busy. But 
would you send me a copy

Among the saintly 
sayings attributed to Hank 
are : 

"I think that it's im-
portant to people's egos to 
have someone to look down 
on, someone that will make 
them seem handsome and 
witty and talented. That's 
why people need me."

Your article of 1/25 about

Arab women face in

that of its former per-
secutors . I only hope that 
someday the people may be 
able to throw off the entire 
syndrome and learn to live 
in that peace and afety 
where, refusing to hurt 
others, one can cease to 
hurt him If by means of 
others.

Editor's Reply : 

The " Arab Wom en " 
article was an excerpt from 
an article written by 
Georgie Ann Geyer, a 
correspondent to the 
Mideast from the Chicago 
Daily News; your inference 
that the article is false and 
malicious propaganda from 
" Jewish elements in the l.A . 
community " is totally 
incorrect and says 
something about your own 
prejudices . Also, you seem 
to be invoking "cultural 
relativism" in objecting to 
the criticism of non-
Western culture by " Puritan 
Western minds ." Granted, a 
superficial , emotional 
criticism of other cu ltures 
has often been an excuse 
for war and imperialist 
exploitation . But this doe 
not altl'r the fact that 
brutality and repression are 
practiced in various ways 
by all cultures, and one 
doesn 't always have to be a 
member of a particular 
cu lture to recognize the 
repressive aspects of it and 
protest aga inst them .

MIRV: An Interview with -Dr. Herbert York Pynchon Limerick : There once was a thing called a V-2. To pUot which you did not need to--You just pushed a button , 
by John Snodgrass And it would leave nuHin ' 

Science Synopsis 
But stiffs and big holes and debris . too . 

--Thomas Pynchon 

This Transtage 'bus', used to orbit 
weather satellites is, in terms of its technology, prac-
tically identical to the MtRV system used on ballistic 
missiles. 

Despite the claim that academia doesn 't un-
derstand the realities of modern warfare. Herbert 
YOrft. who once served as acting chancellor of 
UCSD, is a living'exnmple of the fallacy of that thesis. 
thesis . 
In the three or four inches devoted to Dr . York in 

America's Who 's Who, it is noted that he was 
assistant to the Secretary of Defense during the 
reig n of Eisenhower. (Speaking of the Presidency , 
his name also appeared on the renowned Nixon 
Enemies List,) However , for our purposes we are 
more interested in his work during the summer of 
1972 when he wrote a paper for the Stockholm In-
ternational Peace Research Institute on the origins 
of the Multiple Independently Targetable Re-entry 
Vehicle (MIRV). This paper was later published, 
after some editing , in the November ' 73 issue of 
Scientific American. 
During the interview we talkl!d about the im-

plications and complications of MIRV's rather than 
about their design or technical origin. Therefore 1 
will give a brief outline of what MIRV's are. 
First . MIRV is not a rocket, it is the payload. Two 

rockets that I know of have been adapted to carry 
it, namely the Minuteman III , which is an Air Force 
mlssUe, and the Navy's A>seidon, which is launched 
from a submarine. The Navy, it should be noted, is 
presently planning to construct a larger version of 
the Poseidon. called creatively the Trident , to orbit 
MIRV type machinery. 
A common version oj MIRV consists oj three 200 

kiloton warheads and a so called Post Boost Control 
System (see illustration) . Nicknamed a 'bus ', the 
PBeS is a satellite equipped with motors enabling 
its speed and heading to be altered after it is free 
(the system was originally built to orbit weather 
satellites) from the booster rocket. Consider the 
case of MIR V. The booster rocket has burned out 
and the satellite is heading along a trajectory that 
will impact at target one. The first warhead is then 
gently ejected by means of a release spring. The 
satellite then alters its course so that its ex-
trapolated pathway will impact on target two, the 
second warhead is released, and so on. The unique 
destructive power of the MIRV missile is apparent 
in that each of these warheads can be in-
dependently targeted to explode in widely 
separated locations or at the same location but 
approaching from different trajectories. 
By breaking up one big warhead into several 

sma ller ones a certain loss is experienced in total 
explosive 'y ield', the loss becoming greater as the 
number of warheads increases : however. com-
pared to the advantages, such as the almost certain 
penetration of anti·ballistic missile systems, t his 
loss in power is considered neg Ii gable . 
MIRV made it obvious that the ADM was just whal 
MacNamara thought it was all along·-namely a pile of 
junk . . 

Q; Why I~ thl' MIRV mi~sill' ~el'n as a unique modern 
weapon, that i , what fa tor et it apart from the other 
ICBM' ? 

YORK; When political figures have looked at it, for 
in tan ce the American Secretary of Defen e, they have 
sai d the deploym nt of MI RV by I he Rli lans m an or 
may mean th yare preparing for a first trike . Whatever 
the truth of the matter is, it makes pl'ople think that 
whoever is developing and deploying it IS up to no 
good . 

Q : And this is because MI RV is recogni zed as 
possessing the abi lity to knock out a large part of the 
enemy's armaments, since it can hit so many targets at 
once? 

YORK: Yes, but only in the case of land-based missiles 
versus land-based missiles . 

Q ; Uh huh, well of course it can't blow up sub-
marines. 

YORK: And it can't Wow up airplanes that have left 
the ground . But because it does have this special ability 
with respect to a land-based missile force situation, and

because so much of the forces on the two sides, 
(especially on the Russian Side) ar in the form of land-
based missiles, poliJically oriented strategic plann rs, 
like the Secretary of Defense, ju t find it very upsetting 
Whatever the reality may be, it does have that political 
effect. 

Q : Why do the Russians have more mlssil s than the 
United States? 

YOR"; That has a real simple answer In that the basic 
agreement (ed's note: r ferring to the Strategic Arms 
Limitation Treaty. Pha e I talks) is not an arithmetical 
one, but involves cerlain principal s, the main one bei ng 
that there should be a freeze at the levels of deployment 
which either then existed or which were then under 
construction The total number of Russian launchers. 
both land based and sea based, which were then In 
existence or which It was agreed were under con-
stru ction wa simply about 25% more Now, that 's 
missiles only. In saying that the Russians have 25 % 
more missi les, one has to also ay that the U .S has mo t 
of its strategic megatonage on airplanes and not on 
mi iles . And there's no limitation on airplanes, 50 that 
only about 20% of the U.S. strategic forces are covered 
by the agreemen t. That part that happ ns to be covered 
happ ns to b less than what the Russians have of the

same kind, but the US . has many more intercontinental 
bombers Ihan the Russians. 

Q : The ABM (anti-ballistic missile) was stamped 
defunct in the SALT I talks . Was this a direct result of 
Ihe MIRV mi ssi le? 

YOR"; The existence of MIRV and its possible 
d ployment as a means for making ABM penetration 
c rt ain is one of the main argumen t ~ against ABM- not 
at all the only one, but it is one of the JTlalO one and In 
the mind of many perhap the mo t convinci ng 
Therefore the development and deployment of MI RV's 
ha played a major role in getting the two sides to agree 
to limit ABM's to the small number they now have . 

That'~ one of the reasons Mac amara gave for being In 
favo r of MIRV

YOR"; I was Involved In the lal('r part of the MIRV

before the Arms Control Subcommltt e of the roreign

Q; What did you say thl'n . lust mor(' or less what 
you've sa id here' 

YORK: Well , not QUItE' bE>rau<,r propl oldn't ask mE' 
the same questions What I sa id 1<' that It's it wastl' of 
time, that It wouldn 't do any good 

Q ; In the rE'port you wrotl' for SIPRI you ~aid that thE' 
MIRV missi le had already b en drploYl'd whllp 
Congress was still debating thl' ",sue 

YORK; MIRV IS th kind of thing tha"~ small pnollgh 
so that it doesn'l really coml' to the attl'ntlon o f 
Congress until it's too latl' rurthermore. thp MIRV had 
been di scussed in the Senate Arm Services CommlttE'P 
yea r b fore It was discusspd by thosl' primarily In-

discussed by the Sl'nate as a whole. and It dldn't drl~e

And there's nothing ~u rprl5lng about that II'S IU<,t a far t

YORK; It doesn 't necessari ly confu<;€' It. but the 
elements of the arms race are not all of onl' kind Many 
of the developments of the arms race havE' bel'n of 
systems which , like thiS one (MIRV), came about for 
many reasons, which had many different technological 
roots , and which were cam d forward for rea ons whICh 
had little or even nothing to do With their E'ventual 
application . In thi s ca~e It is Simply Impo'>slble to 
confront the Item ; there IS no place wherl' you ca n

Maybe if next time there is a change in personalities, in 
the leadership of the two countries ... 

Q; Because they were topped' 
YORK; Not only becau e they were topped . th 

variou components that go to make up the ABM (the 
computers, the rockets thl'm~elves , and most of thp

Cagers Face Biola Tonight • In Gym 
by Kirk Robinson 

For all the apatheti 
basketball fan s that these 
hallowed pages have been 
writing about for the last 
few weeks, here is an 
important announcement 
THE RE WILL BE A 
BASKETBALL GAME 
TONIGHT (rRIDAY , 
FEBRUARY 1) AT 8 pm IN 
THE MAIN GYM . The 
Tritvr; will be hosting Biola 
ColleJe of La Mirada. 

Last weekend thE' Tritons 
travelled north to compete 
in ' he All-California 
Basketball tournament at 
UC Davis . On Friday night 
the Tritons played what 
Coach Bill Re ves ca lled 
"the team's best game of 
the YE'ar." Un fortunat Iy 
they 10 t a very close game 
in the last minute to 
nationally ranked UCR . The 
Tr :·ons had held a small 
lead throughout the game 
On Iy to lose the lead with a 
minutE' Ipft The Tritons 
were forced to foul in order 
to get the ball back, but 
UCR converted the free 
throws and held on to 
register a 66-62 win. Reev s 
said the whole team played 
exceptionally well , but 
pointed specifica lly to the 

play of Steve Higgins and 
Joe Coit who both played 
brilliantly. 

On Saturday night Th 
Tritons emptied the bench 
in a 99-67 annihilation of 
UC San ta Cruz. This game 
gave everyone game ex-
perience that will be helpful 
for next season . Monday 
night fou nd the Tritons in 
Turlock (I th ink Turlock is 
somewhere in the boon-
docks south of Stockton) as 
hosts of the Stanislaus State 
Basketball team . And 
ungracious hosts they were 
as they took another close 
one away from the Tritons 
by the score of 70-63. 

The Tritons re ord 
presently stands at 9 wins 
and 10 losses, with a record 
of 3-3 in league play . Th re 
are presently 7 games 
remaining on the schedule 
With five of the games 

~cheduled at home . In clude 
in the home gam ~ are 
contests with USIU, USD 
and league leader Fresno 
Pacific . All three teams are 
very strong, and the games 
should be tough ones. 

So far this year the 
Tritons have employed a 
balanced sco rin g atta k 
with all five starters 
averaging 10-15 points a

ga me. Paul Trainer and Joe 
Coi t , despite a distinct la k 
of height have performed 
admirably on the board s. 
Better executio n and 
teamwork have helped 
bring the Tritons out of th 
slump of the last two weeks . 
Team depth has also im-
proved now that Jim Sivilli 's 
nose has healed and Rusty 
Knight has recovered from 

as all but one player, Steve 
Higgins, will be returning . 
With a year of experience 
under their belts the Tritons 
should have an excellent 
team next year .

When asked to comment 
on crowd apathy Coach 
Reeves smiled and said, "a 
vocal and partisan crowd 
really helps to Inspire the 
players ." So take note and 
come on .out tonight to 
support a good team. 

Coach Reeves is also 
looking ahead to next year

Intercollegiate Sporta Alive 

II UNTITLED IV 
By Mark Liska 

Maybe its the dearth of 
football, the newness of 
freshmen, the late school 
year s tart, or maybe its just 
that way, but fall quarter 
doesn 't seem to be as active 
athletically as winter 
quarter in terms of in-
tercollegiate competition. 
As a matter of fact, there 
are more sports going on in 
winter quarter than broken 
beakers or unm eltabl e 
melted crucibles in 2DL 
chem lab. (Had to think 
hard for t hat one, so eat it 
up while you can humor 
lovers) . 

There's a wid variety of 
activities occuring and no 
'matter where your intere ts 
lie, they should be located 
somewhere in the reachab le 
zone of the athl etic 
program. 

We all know that the 
superb basketball team IS 
still around - or do we? In 
order to squelch all doubts, 
YES, the basketball team IS 
still around and playing 
their guts out. If it weren't 
for a cou pl e of points h re 
and there (3 at Biola over 
there, 1 over there at 
Westmont, 4 at Ri versi de 
then at Davis, 1 here at Pt. 
Loma) their record would 
be quite a bit better than it 
is now (and it ain 't that bad 
at the moment) . Well , those 
old Tritons are heading into 
combat rriday nite against 
1310la at 8 '00 and if you 've 
been waiting for your 
chan e to prove how loyal 
you are, here it is. If you 
don't like ba ketball , th re 's 
always the cheerleaders to 
go watch - rumor ha it 
thoy're goi ng to pull a few 
new routines on the home 
folk . 

So you don 't like 
basketball and you don 't 
want to go watch th men 's 
team play, rightl In that 
case I won't remind you 
knowledgeable sports 
aff iclan .. dos of the belt r 
hal f of the basketball 
program here and it ' ain't 
Intramurals , we're yappin ' 
about. February 11 the 
Women's Basketball team 
opens thei r home chedule 
for the 1974 season . If you 
haven't seen the girls in 
action then you haven't 

seen ALOT and your chance 
to catc h up on lost time is 
coming quickly . The 
women's BB team has a 
great past and are looking 
forward to a great future 
under their new coach . 

Is it spring? Naw, it can 't 
be spring, it 's winter quarter 
and winter quarter is always 
in the winter tim e. During 
wi nter quarter there's 
always snow on the ground , 
rain in the air, dew on the 
grass, frost on the breath 
and sleet on the windows . I 
haven 't seen anything of 
the kind , I'd swear it was 
pring just from the fine 

tenni s-playing weather La 
Jolla has been enjoying 
lately . In fact, Lute Olsen 
and friend s think it 's 
ummertim because the 

smell of lea ther and the 
sound of bat hitting ball , 
and glove hitting hand are 
in the air. You 've all 
guessed it by now, the 
baseball team start s a long 
gruelin g sea on thi s month . 
They've been keying for the 
s ason since September and 
should be va tly improved 
from last year 's fine squad. 
Their season tart h re two 
weeks from today, rebruary 
15. Their rival will be Ca l 
State Fullerton, so all you 
bubblegum chewers have 
something to look forward 
to already. 

' That's not all that mak 
winter look lik summer 
around here. That sand and 
un sport volleyball I t ill

the START of the season .

Fencers Continue Winning 
Ways, Grab All-Cal 

The UCSD fencing team 
upheld their 3'h year 
winning streak last weekend 
at the All-Cal tournament , 
taking on six of the UC 
sc hool s. Surpassing last 
year's winning margin of 
one point, the team 
members left UCLA and 
Berkeley behind in second 
and third place by nearly a 
forty point leeway. 

I n contrast to the 1973 
team , this season's team 
consi sts of relat ively few 
experienced foilsmen . The 
women's foil team includes 
five freshmen and one 
senior . The men's foil has 
two sophomores, two 
seniors; the epee team -
four freshmen, one senior; 
and the sabre team - two 
freshmen, one junior and 
two seniors. At the AII-Cai , 
the experienced players 
were able to participate on 
more than one team, aiding 
to the overall team 

strength . 
The epee team - Steve 

Mirk , Stan Robinson, Daryl 
de Vinney and Mark 
Whaley - took an un-
defeated f irst, leav ing UCLA 
and Cal to place second and 
third . To add to this glory, 
Steve, Daryl and Stan 
placed first, second and 
third respectively in the 
epee individ ual s. Never 
before in the eight years of 
the AII-(al fenCing meets 
has one school dominated 
the individuals as these 
three did. 

Carl Wheeler , David 
Kahn, Daryl de Vinney and 
Stan Robinson of the men's 
foil team also stand un-
defeated. De Vinney and 
Robin on placed first and 
second in the individual 
foil. 

The women' foil team of 
Diane Hayes , Kathy 
Hopkins , Debbie Cox , 
Gloria Cain, and Susan 

Flanegan placed third in the 
tournament . Diane took 
second place i n the 
women's individual foil . 

Jim Eller, Henry 
Sebastian, Steve Heard, and 
Stan Robinson scored 
crutial points for the entire 
team when placing second 
in sabre. 

In em phasizi ng an 
essential and successful 
team effort, Coach Jim 
White feels his foilsmen

continued by ~ayir'g "only 
two weeks ago the 
Chancel I 0 r' s (Studt> Af-
fairs) office finally decided 
where it wanted the par-
titions in it sectior. of the 
facility. " 

This is just one example 
in Bookman's words "where 
conflicts between the needs 
of the various 
organizations the ~pecifications 'of th 
student centre and the 
buildi ng requirement and 
restrictions of Architectural 
and Engineeri ng (A&E) 
Department have con-
tributed to the delay of 
construc t ion . 

In addition to these 
conflicts, problems with the 
ordering of equipment have 
been Inst rumental in the 
delay. Apparently someone 
neglected to order the 
transformer for the campus 
radio station KSDT, one of 
the major tenants in the 
new centre. As of now the 
transformer will not arrive 
before rebruary 5, if not 
later and it will take two 
weeks to install . 

the ~upport of tho,\, peop le 
who make up the bulk of 

tho~e who will use the 
facility . In the Cd e of the 
student centre, the com· 
mittee was compo~ed of 
tudents , sta H of Student 
Affair~, and AM offiCIals. 
Thus in this case ,tudents 
are partly to blame ill the 
delay of the furniture or· 
ders. 

Charge of Inadequate 
,pace for the vaflou 
organizations prompted 
Bookma n to say " there have 
been space problems 
primarily because Step One 
of the cent re (the part now 
under construction) is not 
large enough to handle the 
needs of the 25 or so 
organizations allocated 
space ." 

There were around 50 
student organizations with 
space requests . The space 
problem became 
aggrevated when the Vice 
Chancel lor's immediate 
'staff decided to move into 
Step One of the centre 

The lack of space in the 
centre has been highlighted 
by the announcement that 
even in Step Two of the 
centre (now under plan-
ning) there is not enough 
square footage to provide a 
large ballroom type faCIlity 

Bookman said that Step 
Two of the centre will be 
more organized . Prior to 
thIS September when Book-
man b came Dlfector of the 
Student Centre there wa no 
central authority to 
coordinate Step One. ow 
Step Two will be clo ely 

The plans for the radio 
statIon drawn up over a 
y ar ago were lost by 
someon in the A&E 
Department The plans, 
drawn up by th ex-station 
manager of KSDT, were of a 
great detat! and theIr loss 
has resulted In onsiderable 
delay In the movement of 
the radio statIon from 
Matthews Campu to th 
centre. This was to have 
been accomplished over 
the Christmas VacatIOn 
wh n the move would have 
been a relatIvely minor 
affair and cause no 10 s in 
programming. A move now 
in the middle of the quarter 
will cause conSIderab le 
disruption in the operation 
of KSDT 

upervised as Bookman and 
the Undergraduated 
Student Counci l (TUSC) 
have initiated a serie of 
meetings to plan Step Two 

The furnitllre for the 
centre was ordered late. 
Th,s was the fault of the 
Building Advisor~ Com -
mittee which didn't work 
closely enough WIth the 
other groups planning the 
centre A Building Advisory 
Committee is formed for 

v~ry new building enlIsting 

"Once the plan to Step 
Two has been complet d 
there will be no last minute 
changes as there was in 
Step One which delay 
completion and increa e 
the cost ." Bookman con-
cluded by saying that " there 
is a multitude of needs with 
one centre. Trying to bring 
the variou group together 
to build a coheSIve plan !, a 
necessity."

Triton Times, appeared on campus. In his 
address, he attributed activism on the 
part of students to youthful "high 
spirits," and said the real "revolutionary" 
sources on campus were professors such 
as Marcuse and Richard Popkin . Sub-
sequent visits by the jlssemblyman were 
scenes of particularly pointed question 
and answer sessions (his lectures were on 
pollution) between Stull and UCSD 
students. 

Other visitors to the campus that fall 
included Ralph Nader, the topic of 
whose address ~onsumerism was perhaps 
too abstract and complex to capture the 
interest of a group of students who were 
too aware of a war that threatened many 
of them directly, and Vice-President 
Agnew, who had very recently made his 
famous "intellectual snobs" remark 
about student activists. A third visitor 
was Dran Van Dinh , former South 
Vietnamese ambassador to the Un ited 
States, whose opinion of Vietnam ization 
was uncompromising : " It will fail. " 

On November 21 , the Students for a 
Democratic Society (SDS) held a rally in 
the plaza . 500 students attended, along 
with two Marine Corps, who were the 
objects of some bitterness from the 
students. And on January 19, 40 pickets 
met a General Electric recruiter as he 
came on c ampus , protesting that 
company's contributions to war industry 
and research, and what the SDS termed 
" male chauvinism" in employment 
procedures . 

February marked one of the most 
dramatic periods of the year, as students 
at UC Santa Barbara broke out in a 
"ghetto-year," as students at UC Santa 
Barbara broke out in a " ghetto-like" riot 
in nearby Isla Vista and set fire to the 
local Bank of America . The bank was 
accused of representing " the financing of 
th e Vietnam wa·r and capital ist 
repression ." The same week, Asem-
blyman John Stull , who had called for the 
firing of philosophy professor Herbert 
Marcuse and Chancellor McGill the year 
before and who was termed the "primary 
antagonist" of the La Jolla campus by the 

Hitch 
Continued from Pile 1 

(An aside : On April 7, Governor 
Reagan , commenting on student 
militants, said , " If it's to be a bloodbath , 
let it be now." His statement prompted 
Marcuse, along with three other UCSD 
professors, to ca ll for Reagan 's 
res ignation as president o f the board of 
Regents . The Governor d id not do so.) 

Other Events 
• Nec:r the middle of April, there was a 

massive (peaceful) march through 
downtown San Diego, in which many 
UCSD students partiCipated. And back 
on campus, 50 students debated with 
memoirs of the Navy the morality of 
research at the Naval Electronics Lab. 

• The student vs. police confrontations 
at Berkeley that had occured throughout 
most of the year came to a head at the 
end of the month, with a battle between 
police and 3000 UCB students . There was 
also more violence at Santa Barbara. 

• Protesting UCSD defense research, 
200 students occupied building 2A-Prime 
at Muir College for nearly 18 hours. The 
faculty met during the sit-in, and created 
an ad hoc committee to "get to the 
bottom of defense research at UCSD and 
see if we can become less dependent on 
the Department of Defense." The sit-in 
was a result of a ' fairly massive ' SDS 
campaign over the preceeding three 
weeks dealing with war research . 

• With the President's announcement

student participation in a non-credit class . Little or no

professors complained of poor attendance.

Resources was established 
to advise the president on 
the needs and goals for

Dr. Ray Valentine said that he had to spend about 
half the quarter searching for the right level on which to 
present his chemistry seminar, "Microbes Contribution 
to Man ." Valentine felt that the "course should be 
given for credit ." He stated that students as freshmen 
are still used to the "high school way of life" and don't 
know how to deal with a non-credit class yet. He added 
that this is an important class and should continue to be 
of value to students. 

Professor emeritus, Dr. Seymour Harris felt that most 
of the students understood his class on the American 
economy most of the time; he said, however, that, " It 
was a mistake to take away the credit." 

Pearce and Fox did not find the lack of credit to be a 
handicap to their students and Dr. Pearce added, "The

in May of the beginning of campaigns 
into Cambodia, there was a series of sit-
ins in Urey Hall and at the AMES 
department . McGill reacted by 
threatening police intervention , and then 
declaring a state of emergency. The latter 
would require the dism issal of any 
student involved in such a demonstration 
after the declaration . Th e sit-in ended 
peacefully . The next day, the Governor 
ordered all UC campuses and state 
co lleges to close until the following 
Monday, as a result of anti-war protests 
at the school s. 

rallies that year, but they could be 
viewed in a different light now The cry 
for pea~e was just as urgent, just as 
sincerely felt - indeed, death had come a 
little closer. But Winnie's death was not 
as meaningless as those of the soldiers 
thousands of miles off. It was a protest . 
and in the Buddhist sense, an affirmation 
of the sanctity of life 

George Winnie 
By May 10, America~ forces had 

entered Cambodia, and fOll r students had 
been killed at Kent State University in 
Ohio by National Guardsmen. Still, these 
tragedies were removed from UCSD -
they could not produce the kind of 
numbness that enveloped the campus 
when graduate student George Winnie 
set fire to himself on the Revelle plaza. 
He died ten hours later, conscious, and 
pleading for the end of the war. 

And when we compare the two kinds 
of protests we have seen - Winnie's, and 
the thousands of slogan screamers - and 
then look at the reactions from the 
leaders (who. after all , would have to 
make the demanded changes), we must 
wonder : how meaningful , or how ef-
fective, is our screaming if it is Ignored or 
dismissed as youthful "hIgh sptrits1" 
Couldn't such thoughts, as we see the 
movement of the government continue 
unchanged, instill In us a feeling of 
futility and hopelessness? A feeltng that 
might at some later tIme be termed 
'apathy?' 

W in nie's death was incomprehensible 
to many. It was easier to dismiss him as 
pathologic;tllv insane, or at least a little 

off-balanc~, than to look at the tragedy 
straight on, to face it as a dark and ugly 
si de of a si tuation we had seen only at a 
distance. 

Student activism did continue through 
the next two years, but It declined 
noticeable from the height reached In 
the spring of 1970. It had all begun III 
1968 in Columbia, and moved like a wave 
across the nation, igniting activism and 
reactionaryism at the same time. And the 
whole movement seemed to effect very 
little change in its three or four years. 

There were several more marches and And who wouldn't notice thatl 

students really got hold of the subject ." 
Saltman stated, "All of these elements were part of it 

but none-the-Iess, they seemed to be far less detrimental 
than the positive thrust of the program was in getting 
students involved." ' 

He continued, "We're going to try it again in the fall. 
I'm getting the provosts together to try to develop 
a way of ~oing into the program . The issue of c redit 
versus non-credit is being considered again but once 
again I think it's almost better that the program be a 
non-credit course so that we're not worried about who 
did homework and was there finals and did they hand in 
the paper. The real issue is one that is interlocking the 
bridge between the formalistic educational course for 
units and the effective relationship we would try to 
develop between students and a faculty member." 

Overall, Saltman feels the program was a success and 
will be encouraging even more students and faculty 
members to take part, next year.
