Amid the usual collage of loud 
campus-org flyers and advertise-
ments lining Price Center last week, 
a refreshing proposition caught the 
eye. Brand-new UCSD venue the 
Loft had hung posters — subtly 
splashed in vineyard-stuffs and 
suggesting a “vine” tasting — to 
promote Sip, the first in a series of 
lesson-style wine tastings to 
be held in the space. “Indulge 
responsibly,” it cautioned 
students, as much a dis-
claimer as a preview to the 
alcoholic nature of the eve-
ning.

This crafty avoidance by 
the University Events market-
ing department of literally men-
tioning the presence of alcohol 
wasn’t just for the sake of word-
play. A campus policy regulating 
the blatant advertisement of such 
events came to public light and 
was put into rigorous effect when 
Associated Students began holding 
what have come to be known as 
Bear Gardens, a series of campus

Oversale of tickets and 
a larger-than-expected 
crowd cause student 
discontent at the annual 
campus music event.

Rapper Lupe Fiasco performed before a crowd of 4,500 at FallFest Oct. 3. The concert, which filled RIMAC Arena to maximum capacity, saw nearly 2,000 
people turned away at the door. Crowds outside the event grew restless, throwing objects and instigating inflammatory chants against the A.S. Council.

Over 2,000 Shut Out of  FallFest

By Yelena Akopian
Associate News Editor

This year’s FallFest drew the annual 
campus event’s largest crowd in recent 
years — filling RIMAC Arena to its 
4,500 capacity and forcing event orga-
nizers to turn away thousands of would-
be attendees.

Headliner Lupe Fiasco attracted 

a resounding chant of “Fuck A.S.!,” 
rumors of a plan to bum-rush the venue 
gates and the pelting of a glass bottle at 
security personnel. 

“It was really disappointing,” Sixth 
College junior Jeffrey Kawakami said, 
comparing the situation to the 2007 Sun 
God Festival, which gave similar prior-
ity to those with pre-purchased tickets. 
“I was really looking forward to seeing 
Lupe, and I feel that most students 
should have gotten in.”

Although Berg deemed the event 
a success in terms of its popularity, he 
expressed disappointment at the num-
ber of people who were turned away. 

about 6,500 to the annual Associated 
Students-run festival on Oct. 3.

After ushering in the initial flood 
of students and about 70 percent of 
guests who had purchased tickets, 
event organizers and the UCSD Police 
Department shut down the entrance 
to the venue because maximum capac-
ity had been reached and the outside 
crowd had become unruly. Associate 
Vice President of Programming Garrett 
Berg estimated that security turned 
away about 2,000 of those waiting in 
line. 

Groups of students who had 
been denied entry gathered outside 
the entrance to voice their protest. 
Expressions of disapproval included See FALLFEST, page 3

gatherings that offer an opportu-

installment’s lower-than-expected 
turnout on Oct. 20, 2006, was attrib-
uted to the advertising policy still in 
effect today.

But the difference in regulatory 
approach between the events by the

More than a dozen UCSD service 
workers organized a walk-in at Vice 
Chancellor of Business Affairs Steven 
W. Relyea’s office last week in an effort 
to accelerate their yearlong negotiations 
for increased pay.

Led by UCSD groundskeeper Jorge 
Olvera, workers requested a sit-down 
meeting with Relyea, who they believe 
could use his authority as vice chan-
cellor to convince the UC Office of 
the President to allocate more money 
to UCSD service workers, who are 
among the lowest-paid employees in 
the University of California. 

“It’s not a matter of greed,” Olvera 
said. “We are paid 25 to 30 percent less 
than other workers in San Diego, but 
it doesn’t have to be this way. [Relyea] 
understands our struggles, but we want 
to make sure he understands the cri-

and the American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal Employees con-
cerning new patient-care technical and 
service worker contracts. In its most 
recent proposal, the university prom-
ised last month to implement a $13.25 
minimum hourly wage by 2012 and a 
step-based raise system that rewards 
employees for their experience.

“All UC employees deserve to be 
compensated fairly, and we contin-
ue to work hard on our side of the 
negotiations to try to resolve remain-
ing differences,” UCOP spokesman 
Paul Schwartz said. “But an agreement 
requires compromise on both sides. 
We believe our proposals are financially 
realistic, especially in light of the current 
state budget crisis, and we remain hope-
ful that an agreement is near.”

However, the union refused the 
offer, claiming that the university can 
afford more than it is willing to give.

To help gain public support, UC ser-
vice workers have launched a Web site, 
www.FacingPovertyAtUC.org, aimed at 
documenting their financial struggles 
through video interviews, news clips 
and anecdotes. A link is also provided 
for site visitors to e-mail UC executives 
and actively participate in the workers’ 
cause.

sis: UCSD is one of the lowest-paying 
UC campuses. We want him to do 
something we can see, to step up to the 
plate and put money and power to his 
words.”

Relyea was not present at the 
time of the walk-in, but Chief of Staff 
Judy Johnson and Director of Labor 
Relations Keri Donnell promised to 
deliver Olvera’s message to the vice 
chancellor.

Following the walk-in, Relyea was 
not available for comment, but Johnson 
said the vice chancellor is aware of the 
workers’ request and is willing to meet 
with representatives upon his return 
from a mid-October trip to Saudi 
Arabia.

Donnell also offered to meet with 
union representatives herself so that 
the request for a conference could be 
accommodated before Relyea’s itinerary 
would allow. 

“The university system is work-
ing diligently to settle these important 
issues,” Donnell said. “I have reached 
out to the leaders of AFSCME and 
invited them to meet with me so that I 
can hear from them.”

the current U.S. financial crisis.
During the last fiscal year, in 

which the national economy gener-
ally contracted, UCSD spent a total 
of $2.275 billion and provided the 
state with 20,790 jobs, making it 
the third largest employer in San 
Diego.

“When we think about job cre-
ation, when we think about tech-
nology, when we think about life 
sciences, when we think about all 
those types of things, UCSD helps 
San Diego grow both nationally and 
internationally,” San Diego Mayor 
Jerry Sanders said.

The report also detailed a more 
widespread university impact on 
San Diego County’s economy, 
including 193 start-up companies 
founded by faculty, alumni or stu-
dents and 12,810 new jobs.

Alumnus Steven Hart, co-
founder of digital communications 
giant VioStat, credits UCSD for 
much of the innovation essential to 
the economy.

“I can’t help but think of the 
differences between the optimism 
at UCSD and the economy as it is,” 

Hart said. “We’re really fortunate 
to have a world-class institution 
in our backyard. You have to have 
people willing to move to see lots of 
jobs and lots of opportunity.”

CBRE reported that UCSD spent 
$798 million on research expendi-
tures over the last fiscal year, for 
a total of 373 new inventions, 85 
license agreements and 64 patents 
— in addition to the 500 active 
patents it currently owns. Speakers 
at the ceremony agreed that the 
figures are impressive.

“For a university under 50 years 
old to achieve so much is simply 
amazing,” Matthews said. 

Chancellor Marye Anne Fox 
noted the importance UCSD, named 
the seventh best public university in 
the nation by U.S. News & World 
Report, holds among academics.

“The university maintains thou-
sands of jobs which offer resistance 
to economic hard times and cut-
ting-edge research and academic 
research,” Fox said.

Spending has increased signifi-
cantly since the 2006-07 fiscal year, 
in which UCSD spent approximate-
ly $714.3 million on research. The 

campus’ medical center in particu-
lar has grown exponentially, now 
serving over 21,000 patients annu-
ally and seeing over 650 alumni 
remain in the county to continue 
medical practice.

“These are numbers that show 
we have stability, but what else?” 

Vice Chancellor of Resource 
Management and Planning Gary 
Matthews said. “That ‘what else’ is 
important. It’s really the intangibles 
that matter.”

“By the time the doors had opened, 
the line stretched from the entrance 
to all the way past the end of RIMAC 
Field,” Berg said. “We let in all of those 
people and most that had arrived by 
8:30 p.m. It wasn’t something I agreed 
with, and at the end of the day safety 
had to trump customer service.”

To avoid similar situations occurring 
in the future, the A.S. Council is consid-
ering plans to either limit the number of 
tickets sold or not sell tickets at all.

Limiting the number of tickets 
sold, however, may make it impossible 
to book popular acts that come with 
high pricetags. According to Berg, the 
800 tickets sold for $18 each to guests, 
graduate students, alumni, staff and 
faculty funded a significant portion of 
the event.

“Without that bringing funding in, 
we wouldn’t be able to get an act like 
Lupe Fiasco,” Berg said, explaining that 
if the A.S. Council decides not to sell 
tickets to FallFest in the future, students 
would have to pay to make up for the 
funding gap. “We want to sell some 
tickets, but [not so many that it forces 
us] to turn away a significant number 
of students.”

The council will also look into hold-
ing events with high attendance expec-
tations on RIMAC Field. The field has a 
maximum capacity of 20,000, but gives 
priority to sporting events, and there 
were two during this year’s FallFest.

“It won’t be easy to attain, but we will 
be looking into it,” Berg said, reminding 
students to arrive to events early when 
space is limited. “Whether it’s the Loft 
or RIMAC Field, we’re always going to 
have to turn away people if everyone 
arrives.”

MONDAY, OCTOBER 6, 2008

Hi! I’m Hadley Mendoza report-ing from sunny San Diego and with the Oct. 20 voter-
registration deadline fast approaching 
I have invited two special guests to join 
me in this installment of “Stealing the 
Shoes.” I’m pleased to introduce Chris 
Moffat, president of UCSD’s College 
Democrats and Megan Rodriguez, 
the statewide southern region chair 
for the College 
Republicans. 

The 2008 elec-
tion is more impor-
tant for students to 
vote in that any 
other in their life-
time. Forget that 
it’s historic — for 
the first time the White House won’t 
just be for white men and all that 
jazz — America has reached a turning 
point, and the next administration is 
going to be presiding over some of the 
greatest issues that our country and 
the world have faced to date. Though 
our communities are more open and 
accepting than ever, our government 
is still denying us simple rights: the 
Patriot Act takes unreasonable liber-
ties with constitutional freedoms, and 
evangelical demagogues threaten to 
dismantle the country’s very founda-
tion — separation of church and state 
— by governing with their religion, 
reversing Roe v. Wade and continu-
ing to legislate prejudice by denying 
homosexual couples the same rights as 
their heterosexual counterparts. The 
United States is in two big wars, the 
futures of which are uncertain, with 
men and women our age dying every 
day. Terrifying as it is, the economy is 
on the verge of collapse — it doesn’t 
take an expert to see that when the 
largest banks and financial firms are 
being taken over by the feds it’s a pretty 
dire situation, and this is the economy 
that students will turn to for jobs as 
they soon graduate. In an international 
arena characterized by globalization, 
rising nuclear powers, out-of-control 
genocide and entire countries so poor 
their citizens are dying from birth, the 

Bush administration has completely 
destroyed our credibility with the rest 
of the world, reducing America to a dis-
gusting joke. And decades of frivolous 
waste and pollution are finally taking 
their toll on the Earth, as increasingly 
dangerous storms ravage the coasts, 
water levels rise and ice caps melt. 

These are the facts, and while par-
ties, politicians and pundits can argue 

over causes and 
solutions for these 
problems, every-
one can agree that 
the time to address 
them is now and 
the person who 
will be addressing 
them is the next 

president of the United States.
So let’s open the floor to my guests: 

Why do you each feel it’s so important 
for students to vote in this election?

College Republican Megan 
Rodriguez: Well obviously this election 
is really important just because of the 
issues that have been happening lately 
… so this is a vital election where people 
really need to get out and vote in order 
to pick the right candidate that they feel 
will best handle the situation and get us 
out of this recession and help get out of 
the wars successfully. Personally, I really 
encourage everyone to get out and vote 
I think it’s a great right to have and 
something that people should definitely 
take advantage of. And that’s the best 
way you can really get your opinion out 
there and elect someone that you feel is 
right for the position.

College Democrat Chris Moffat: I 
think what’s different about this election 
… [is that people are] taking a very close 
look at the issues, they’re taking a very 
close look at both candidates and every-
one seems to feel that their vote truly 
matters. In fact, the College Democrats 
at UCSD registered about 1,300 stu-
dents in the past two weeks on Library 
Walk. I’m incredibly excited about that. 
And those aren’t just democratic num-
bers; those are everyone numbers, from 
what I’ve seen, of people who have reg-
istered at the College Democrats table. 

… You can just feel it. Whenever you go 
to a debate party and you see students 
booing John McCain or booing Barack 
Obama or shouting their approval of 
something one of them said. People feel 
like this election truly does matter.

But let me interrupt my guests for 
just a moment to remind readers that 
their votes are so much greater than the 
small pieces of paper on which they’re 
cast. Your vote can and will change 
the future — if every college-aged 
American voted we’d determine the 
election’s outcome every time. That’s 
a lot of power, and it’s power that I 
expect and demand UCSD students to 
take seriously, by educating themselves 
on the issues and the candidates. An 
uninformed vote is just as bad, if not 
worse, than an individual who denies 
himself a voice altogether by not vot-
ing. Allow me to illustrate this point 
with another question for my guests. 
Here is a candidate-specific question 
for Megan, and then Chris, you’ll have 
a chance to respond. 

I think many students are very 
curious about Sarah Palin. She’s kind 
of been kept away from the media, she 
hasn’t had too many interview oppor-
tunities so far and she’s pretty new 
to the game, so can you speak a little 
about Palin and why students should 
really get behind her?

MR: I think Sarah Palin was actu-
ally a great pick. I think she helped boost 
our ratings in the polls, she gave the 
campaign a whole new dynamic, which 
is something that I don’t think any other 
VP pick could have done. I think Palin, 
yes she is a new player in the scheme of 
the political world, but so was Obama 
two years ago. He doesn’t have that 
much more experience, she does have 
the experience of being an executive. I 
mean, she was the governor of Alaska, 
which is a state and she did have the 
same powers that would be equivalent 
to a president or vice president. Yes, 
she’s new but she does have experience. 
I mean, she has an approval rating 
of over 90 percent in Alaska, which is 
phenomenal for a governor. That’s very 
rare, so obviously she is doing something 

right there. She has helped fight the 
oil corporations, under her leadership 
Alaska has actually started bringing in 
more money and so she returned that 
to the citizens instead of wasting it on 
earmark spending. … Something we 
really need to get on top of is being more 
efficient with taxpayer money and that’s 
something that Sarah Palin has done. I 
mean, she did give back money to the 
citizens of Alaska. Also, she’s someone 
that people can relate to, she’s not one 
of these politicians that’s part of the 
good old boys club or who’s been around 
forever. She’s someone that women can 
relate to and she’s someone that people 
from small towns can relate to from all 
across America, obviously. 

CM: Well when I was thinking 
about who McCain would pick for vice 
president and when I heard that he 
picked Palin I was incredibly shocked 
and confused at the same time. First off, 
I had never heard of Palin, and then the 
fact that she has such little experience 
in politics, I mean we can argue the fact 
that she has more executive experience, 
being the mayor of a small town and 
then governor of a state, but what does 
that really show the American people, 
the fact that you’ve been a governor of 
a state? When you think about it a lot 
of our presidents have come out of the 
legislature, whether it’s the House of 
Representatives or the Senate, as many 
as people who’ve been coming out of 
the governorships of states. … Really, 
it doesn’t matter if you have experience 
in the legislature or experience in an 
executive position. What matters  is 
the experience you have, and then not 
just experience but what you do with 
that experience. … The reason why it 
seems to me that the McCain campaign 
seems to be hiding her from the voters is 
because they don’t want them to see that 
Palin is a very right-wing ideologue. 
Specifically, the position she takes on 
abortion, she wants to outlaw abortion 
in all cases, even if it’s a rape case. That’s 
not even right, to me, that’s how incred-
ibly confused I was by McCain’s choice.

FallFest as It Should Be
       

By Simone Wilson
Senior Staff Writer

ON CAMPUS — When campus 
events are touted as free for students, 
they’re implied to be almost favors 
from the university, bestowed upon  
starving, jobless undergraduates for 
one night of escape from Geisel 
Library. Of course we’re grateful 
— plenty of sister universities don’t 
offer anywhere near the quantity of 
extracurricular entertainment, not 
to mention quality of content, that 
UCSD does.

However — to cop the idealistic 
platform of our fave blue-state candi-
date and his articulate leading lady — 
those campuses as they are don’t mean 

we can lose 
sight of our 
campus as it 
should be.

A m o n g 
heaps of other 

mysterious entries 
in the undergraduate 

bill every quarter is one 
aptly named the Campus 

Activity Fee, a $28-per-stu-
dent allotment to Associated 

Students toward the funding of 
on-campus events. (Almost four 

times that amount per student is 
divvied out to UCSD sports teams to 
ensure they play in luxury, but that’s 
a gripe for another day.) So, FallFest 
being the single major free-for-stu-
dents activity planned for fall quarter, 
it becomes quite clear that by mere 
status as a paying undergraduate, we 
are by default shelling out at least the 
$18 ticket price charged to the public 
— which is all nice and cuddly if we 
do indeed choose to attend.

But last Friday, as thousands of 
students eager to catch Ben Kweller, 
We Are Lions and Lupe Fiasco in 
their very own backyard (and for 
free!) were turned to the streets out-
side RIMAC Arena, they weren’t 
just paying in tears: The venue’s low 
maximum capacity and a significant 
number of nonstudent ticket-hold-

ers denied many a campus card-
wielding hopeful the right to what 
they had already paid for back when 
tuition was due. Even some of the 
nonaffiliates with prepaid tickets 
were denied entry — with promise 
of a refund, sure, but nothing really 
makes up for the pointless drive and 
a ruined Friday night.

Event coordinators encourage 
us to arrive early to the arena to 
avoid such a fate, but if everyone 
who wanted to get their activity fee’s 
worth followed that advice, we’d be 
stuck with the same problem — only 
an hour earlier.

According to A.S. councilmem-
bers, talent this swoon-worthy 
couldn’t have been afforded without 
extra funding from ticket sales. But 
nothing — not even the great Fiasco 
himself — should compromise 
the right of every undergradu-
ate to the fruits of that activi-
ty fee, and the maintenance 
of FallFest as a service to 
the students first.

Perhaps the less popu-
lar opening acts could be 
compromised, or students 
could be charged an extra 
couple bucks to bridge the 
funding gap; maybe the 
festival could be made up 
of high-quality but lesser-

known (and therefore more afford-
able) groups, and Lupe could play 
RIMAC Field on a separate bill, with 
a greater capacity for paying nonaf-
filiates with plenty of space left over 
for student discounts.

But above all, scheduling should 
be maneuvered to ensure the signifi-
cantly larger RIMAC Field be avail-
able the single night of the quarter 
it’s needed for something other than 
unpopular sporting events.That way, 
arriving early would mean a pleas-
antly intimate spot in spitting range 
of the main act — not a swift kick 
out the front door.

UC Workers 
Deserve Control 
Over Pensions

By Matthew McArdle
Senior Staff Writer

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA — 
The University of California is consis-
tently praised for the high quality of its 
educational and research programs, and 
attracts the best students and faculty 
from around the nation. But beneath 
this glowing exterior are the thousands 
of workers who form the backbone of 
the 10-campus system, many of whom 
could never be able to afford to send 
their children to earn a degree from the 
very university that employs them. 

Charged with maintaining build-
ings and grounds and providing caf-
eteria and bus services, these workers 
are almost consistently locked in com-
plicated battles with the university for 
increased wages and benefits to bring 
their salaries up to par with service 
workers at state community colleges, 
who earn about 25 percent more than 
their UC counterparts.

While UCSD Chancellor Marye 
Anne Fox rakes in an annual salary just 
under $400,000 and UCSD Medical 
Center CEO Richard J. Liekweg tops 
out near $600,000, workers such as 
senior custodian Yolanda Burdette earn 
a mere $1,600 a month, barely enough 
to pay for basic necessities. 

In fact, service workers are the low-
est-paid in the UC system and currently 
receive no wage increases for extended 
service, according to Lakesha Harrison, 
president of the local chapter of the 
American Federation of State, County 
and Municipal Employees, the union 
representing approximately 20,000 ser-
vice workers systemwide. While the 
university has offered during back-and-
forth negotiations to gradually increase 
the salaries of service workers to $13.25 
an hour by 2012 and implement a raise 
system that rewards employees based 
on experience, these plans are still years 
away from producing any tangible ben-
efits for workers like Burdette.

Amid this jumble of demands and 
counterdemands, however, stands a 
promising provision sponsored by state 
legislators which would give workers 
an increased voice regarding their UC 
Retirement Plans.

Unlike other state employees, UC 
workers have no say over the way their 
pensions are organized. The provision, 
called ACA 5, aims to change the cur-
rent system, amending the state consti-
tution to establish a board of trustees to 
oversee the $43-billion UCRP. Backed 
by AFSCME, the provision must secure 
the support of 694,000 voters to appear 
on the June 2010 ballot.

The University of California is a 
prestigious institution, but the way it 
treats its hardworking service workers 
is embarrassing. At a time when they 
continually struggle to make ends meet, 
this provision is a vital step toward 
lifting employees from poverty. While 
the union and the university are locked 
horn-to-horn over wages, citizens across 
the state now hold the power to signifi-
cantly better the lives of service workers 
by supporting ACA 5 and allowing 
them control over UCRP. Although 
more contentious issues such as pay 
raises still need to be ironed out, ACA 
5 is a much-needed step toward giving 
UC workers a say in the governance 
of retirement plans funded by wages 
they have already fought so diligently to 
secure. To not support it would be a slap 
in the face to the very workers that keep 
the university on its feet.

MONDAY, OCTOBER 6, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5

Help UCSD Help the Earth, 
Don’t Steal Plates 

Dear Editor,
UCSD implemented a new program 

this semester in an attempt to be more 
environmentally friendly and sustain-
able in our operations. We now offer 
compostable plates, cups and flatware 
instead of plastic or Styrofoam. We 
polled students last quarter about our 
operations and one of the issues that 
often arose was our usage of plastics and 
other Earth-unfriendly items. 

We found that students have resisted 
our efforts and now are taking our 

ceramic plates, cups and metal silver-
ware from the dining halls at astonish-
ing rates. We have lost thousands of 
plates, cups and silverware in the first 
week alone. Because of the alarming 
rate of loss I am reaching out to you to 
please help spread a simple message. 
We don’t expect students to return our 
property. The university has numerous 
locations around campus where these 
items can be left. If these locations can-
not be found, students can leave their 
items outside their rooms and we will 
gladly pick them up. What we ask is that 
they please do not discard their items 
into the trash! Please help us in our 
efforts to reduce unnecessary waste and 

operate in a more sustainable fashion. 
Together we can make a difference.

Production Manager,

I would have thought he’d pick someone 
more moderate. 

Wait, what? I’m afraid I need to 
respectfully intervene. These shallow 
answers are symptomatic of a huge 
problem with the political process. By 
failing to educate ourselves beyond 
what we’re told — be it by our friends, 
our parents or our party — we are 
undermining our democratic freedoms 
and spitting in the face of every person 
who fought for the 26th Amendment. 
Voting isn’t just about jumping on a 
bandwagon, it’s about thinking criti-
cally, questioning thoroughly and 
exhausting your research until you 
are absolutely sure you’re supporting 
something you truly believe.

Megan, your response failed to 
answer my question and you merely 
recycled the same conservative talk-
ing points we’re already flooded with. 
You start by telling us that Palin was 
a strategically good choice, which, if 
anything, detracts from her legitima-
cy. Then you take a cheap — and off-
topic — jab at Obama. You go on to 
point out that she has a high approval 
rating (your figure was innacurate; it’s 
actually barely 80 percent) in a state 
that on a local level deals with very 
few of the same issues facing the other 
49 in the Union. Next you make two 
misleading claims — it’s true she gave 
money back to citizens, but just as she 
distributed the budget surplus, she 
recommended borrowing money to 
pay for necessary road projects. And 
although while governor she made a 
show of cracking down on earmark-
ing — forget that many of her vetoes 
were reversed since she had actually 
failed to understand the importance of 
the legislation — as mayor of Wasilla, 
Alaska, she brought a record amount 
of pork to her tiny town. Finally, you 

say she’s strong because people can 
relate to her; she’s the just-like-us can-
didate. But does that mean hockey 
moms around the nation are fit for the 
White House? Certainly not; President 
George W. Bush played the “I’m just 
an average guy like you” card and lo 
and behold, average folk aren’t quite 
qualified to lead the country. What is 
this push toward the anti-intellectu-
al? We, especially as students, should 
understand the importance of having 
leaders well-versed in the nuances of 
public office. 

And Chris, you should be ashamed 
of yourself! You let her get away 
with this unsatisfactory answer and 
even legitimized it. By showing that 
you know even less about Palin than 
someone who was unable to give us a 
fresh answer, you make us question 
your support for Obama — how can 
you choose a candidate, or even a 
party, if you have no idea what else is 
out there? Your entire response was 
anecdotal, unfounded, convoluted 
and ultimately pointless. You have let 
down your organization, your party 
and your candidate and I can only 
hope that unlike you, the hundreds 
of people you have helped to register 
will give this election the respect and 
careful consideration it deserves.

Tritons, casting your vote in this 
election is the single greatest thing 
you can do to impact the future of 
your country. So please, register now 
— the College Democrats, College 
Republicans and CalPIRG will all 
have booths set up on Library Walk 
from now until the Oct. 20 deadline 
— and inform yourself. It might just 
be the most important homework 
you ever do.

even write ‘21 plus bring ID,’” former A.S. 
President Harry Khanna said in an e-mail 
to the Guardian after the first Bear Garden 
in 2006. “We have to effectively hide the 
fact that there is going to be alcohol at the 
event.” 

The Loft clearly states at the bottom of 
their event advertisements that attendees 
“Must be at least 21 years old with valid 
ID.”

As stated by UCSD policy, “Functions 
at which alcohol will be served may not 
be advertised off campus or in any way 
suggest that alcohol will be served at the 
function or that the function is open to 
the public.”

It additionally notes that “Advertising 

shall not contain statements or inferences 
regarding the availability of alcoholic 
beverages, such as: ‘All You Can Drink,’ 
‘Everyone May Drink,’ ‘Wine and Cheese 
Reception’ or ‘Beer Garden.’”

Garrett Berg, associate vice president 
of programming for 
the A.S. Council, has 
become more than 
familiar with the regu-
lations during his time 
in office.

“I know the cam-
pus policy very well, 
and this certainly isn’t 
the first time an excep-
tion has been made,” 
Berg said.

One such exception took 
place Oct. 21, 2006, the day 
after the first Bear Garden. 
Advertisements for university-
sponsored event UCSD Rocks 
Open House invited students 
to enjoy Karl Strauss Beer at 
the ROCKtoberfest Beer and 
Brats Garden. University offi-
cials promptly apologized for 
the advertising slight. 

To councilmembers, the 
fluctuations in policy regu-
lation point to an apparent 
double standard by the uni-
versity, which favors UC-
affiliated events with what 
are advertised as higher-
minded intentions.

“If the administration 
plans to continue to ignore 
[its] own policy, then it’s 
time for the policy to 
change,” Berg said in an 
e-mail. “In my opinion, 
this policy is outdated 
and even contradictory. 
It doesn’t make sense to 
allow alcohol to be served, 
but then turn around and 
deny all advertisement 
of that alcohol. Most 
importantly, even if this 
policy is not overturned, 
the administration 

should be held accountable for selectively 
enforcing such rules.”

Led by Lindsey Pomeroy, an employee of 
educational wine-event company the Wine 
Smarties, Sip’s lessons in wine tasting were 
designed to stimulate students’ minds and 

palates.
The class consist-

ed of a small scatter-
ing of tables stocked 
with water bottles 
and largely unutilized 
spit-buckets for after 
the wine had been 
tasted. Pomeroy stood 
at the front of the 
room with a micro-
phone and took the 

students through a step-by-step in the joys 
of flavor detection: For the first round, she 
used a Remy Pannier NV Brut from France 
to explain the purpose of champagne flutes, 
the reasons why one doesn’t swirl sparkling 
wine and how the bubbles “dance with your 
tongue.”

According to Berg, Friday’s wine-tasting 
event was not only allowed to violate cam-
pus policy in its advertising, but in the very 
nature of the evening. Bear Gardens had to 
be initially reworked to take the focus off 
alcohol — university policy states that “the 
consumption of alcohol must not be the 
major focus of the event” — whereas the 
only focus at the Loft’s Sip series is drinking, 
albeit of the educational variety.

“This policy needs to be revisited now,” 
Berg said. “It’s unacceptable for A.S. to be 
held to policies that the Loft is allowed to 
blatantly ignore. Former Vice Chancellor 
Watson defended the policy by stating that 
‘Alcohol should not be the principal reason 
why students attend an event sponsored 
by the university.’ Unlike Bear Gardens, it’s 
undeniable that alcohol was the primary 
focus of [Sip: “Vine” Tasting for Dummies]. 
There doesn’t seem to be any possible justi-
fication for this.”

During both sessions held Friday — the 
first from 4 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. and the second 
from 5:30 p.m. to 7 p.m. — each of nearly 50 

On Sept. 27, the UC students in my program and I were treated to a day at a vineyard in Beaujolais, a little 
city just outside of Lyon known for produc-
ing some of the best wine in France. Our 
program director didn’t tell us much about 
what we were going to be doing all day at the 
vineyard, but being a big Paul Giamatti fan, I 
assumed that we would spend the afternoon 
wine tasting a la “Sideways.”

Leaving Lyon’s city limits through a tun-
nel, the busy streets and crowded spaces 
of France’s second-largest city disappeared. 
In their place was a countryside extending 

in every direction, with only an occasional 
farmhouse dotting the landscape. Almost at 
once our bus of 50 energized college students 
stopped chattering to admire the seemingly 
endless shades of reds and yellows signaling 
harvest time. 

Being born and raised in California, rural 
scenery and agriculture is nothing new to 
me, but Beaujolais immediately seemed com-
pletely different from anything I had seen 
back home because the rolling fields I was 
staring at were framed by an equally green 
mountain range that would have seemed out 
of place even in California. 

After a brief detour, lost on backcountry 
roads, we finally pulled into the vineyard 
where we would spend the rest of the day. 
Getting off the bus, we were greeted by a 
couple that led us in front of a rustic-looking 
farmhouse and motioned for us to gather 
around them. The man introduced himself in 
French, but the paused, not sure if the group 
of foreigners in front of him spoke the lan-
guage. Always eager to show French people 
that we do speak their native tongue, we took 
advantage of the opportunity to break the ice 
and asked him to speak in French. Obviously 
relieved, he laughed to himself and finished 
welcoming us to his vineyard. 

He told us that his name was Ludovic 
and introduced us to his wife, Marie. He 
explained that unlike most vineyards in the 
area, he and Marie do not limit their produc-
tion solely to wine, but make their own bread 
as well, which is distributed throughout the 
area. As Ludovic was explaining how he runs 
the wine production and Marie the bread, a 
student raised her hand and asked how the 
couple had met each other. Each of them 
smiled shyly to themselves, looked up at the 
other and proceeded to jointly tell a story that 
they had obviously told hundreds of times 
before but which was recounted with so 
much sincerity that I could have sworn that 
they were telling it for the very first time. 

The two met at a university where they 
each studied a different facet of agriculture. 
After taking enough classes together, Ludovic 
finally asked Marie out on a date, where they 
discovered that they were from a similar 
region in France and each came from an agri-
cultural background. They dated throughout 
their time at the university and got married 
shortly after graduating, but it was not until 
a few years later until they received a phone 
call, showing them their calling in life. Marie’s 
grandmother told them that a vineyard just 
up the road had been put up for sale and 
that the couple should think about making

on offer on it. Although both Ludovic 
and Marie had grown up on farms, nei-
ther of them had any experience with 
large-scale agricultural production, but 
that didn’t stop them from buying the 
acres of farmland that would become 
their home.

 After the introductions, we all went 
inside, where four huge tables were 
waiting for us and we sat down to an 
epic two-hour lunch. Five courses were 
presented and a different bottle of wine 
complemented each one. Although all 
the courses were incredible, our main 
course of beef Bolognese was one of the 
day’s highlights. Marie brought out the 
food in clay pots that had been simmer-

you could see the sauce steaming out of 
every cranny of the supple meat. It took 
a few extra glasses of Ludovic’s wine to 
ease down my triple serving and Marie’s 
freshly baked bread proved to be the 
perfect mop-up utensil, for both the 
leftovers on my plate and chin.

To bring us out of food-induced 
comas, we were served coffee and spent 
the rest of the day touring the vine-
yard and wheat fields where Ludovic 
and Marie grow their ingredients. The 
vineyards were huge and we were all 
surprised to learn that despite bringing 
on extra help for the harvest, the couple 
takes care of their fields on their own 
throughout much of the year. With so 
much work for only two people, it was 
hard to believe Ludovic when he casu-
ally mentioned that he and Marie also 
have four young children to look after. 

While walking through endless rows 
of grape vines I was able to speak with 
Ludovic about the method of growing 
his wine and the agricultural lifestyle in 
general. He spoke with an intense, yet 
very humble, passion about his work, 
and during our conversation he would 
look out over his fields with the same 
love in his eyes that I’m sure he shows 

when tucking in his kids at night. He 
invited me to pick some grapes straight 
off the vines and he grinned when he 
saw my surprise at eating what I found 
to be a rather sour grape. 

“Those grapes you’re used to eating 
from super markets,” he told me, “those 
aren’t true grapes. You want something 
that’s going to give you great wine? 
Then you need these — the real thing.” 

He spoke of the satisfaction in sell-
ing a product he nurtured through 
every step of its life, from seed to vine to 
barrel to bottle. As we walked through 
his vineyard he would drag his hand 
along his side, letting his fingers graze 
his beloved grapes on nearly every vine. 
While talking about how he and Marie 
both cared for the house and their fam-
ily all while running a successful busi-
ness, the midafternoon sun illuminated 
the face of a man who couldn’t possibly 
ask for anything more in life. 

Throughout the day I couldn’t shake 
a feeling that something was so com-
pletely different yet so very calming 
about the area. Whether it was learning 
how to properly drink a good glass of 
wine, walking through the vineyards 
as the sun was setting or just getting a 
kick out of seeing a very stereotypical 
sheepdog running around, the place 
left me questioning my own direction. 
I’m not trying to say that I want to drop 
out of school to start up my own wine 
company; it’s just that being shown such 
an idyllic lifestyle really drew me in. I’ll 
probably never live on a farm and try-
ing to make moonshine in my bathtub 
will be the only thing bringing me close 
to Ludovic’s profession. But observing 
how genuinely happy the man is, and 
knowing that his happiness has been 
made possible by factors that will never 
enter into my own life is actually a very 
refreshing thought.

students was served four glasses of 
wine. Students at the Bear Garden are 
limited to two cups of beer within the 
three-hour time slot.

“Last year, we faced a lot of oppo-
sition to the Bear Gardens when 
[Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs] 
Penny Rue came in,” Berg said. “She 
felt that free beer would lead students 
to skip class.”

The gardens are typically held in 
the afternoon, not unlike the Loft’s 
new wine-tasting events.

Two police officers stopped by 
the Loft on Friday to question event 
coordinators — who assured them 
the alcohol consumption was purely 
educational — and glance over the 
ID-scanning equipment before going 
on their way.

Eleanor Roosevelt College senior 
Mary Kong, along with six other 
wine-tasting participants at her table, 
said they found out about the event 
from the many posters hung in Price 
Center.

Staff at the wine tasting, some of 
which had also participated in market-
ing, seemed unaware that implication 
of alcohol consumption is not permit-
ted under campus advertising policy.

According to UCSD policy, when 
alcoholic beverages are being served 
at a function, a designated official 
must approve any piece of promo-
tional information. 

“We are committed to policy, and 
stand by it,” university spokeswoman 
Stacie A. Spector said. “If a mis-
take was made, it was with another 
department.”

MONDAY, OCTOBER 6, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN   9



monday, october 6, 2008 the UcSd GUardian SportS  

claim that the SEC is just so deep and 
talented that any team can take down 
any other team. Yet isn’t that what hap-
pened with USC? Oregon State, count-
ed out by almost everyone, challenged 
and beat a team that many still regard 
as the most talented in college football 
this year. The Beavs stifled the offen-
sive attack of the Trojan monster and 
pushed past, through and around USC’s 
defensive line to dominate the game.

The Pac-10 has talent outside of 
Southern California, but many peo-
ple overlook that fact. The sometimes 
dubbed “Pac-One” gets no credit, 
with the growing trend of football 
analysts adopting the SEC and Big 10 
Conferences as the best in college foot-
ball.

On Saturday, another upset involv-
ing an SEC team enfolded as No. 
13 Auburn University lost to No. 18 
Vanderbilt University. These SEC upsets 
don’t show the depth of the confer-
ence, but rather the inflated rankings 
of these teams. No matter how you 
look at it, losses are losses, whether it’s 
to a pee-wee third-grade team or to 
Louisiana State University. When all is 
said and done, both the Pac-10 and the 
Southeastern conferences had all but 
two teams win their bowl games last 
year, showing that as a whole, both con-
ferences were equally successful. 

Let’s allow past seasons to be history 
and examine the current season begin-
ning with the start of fall camp. I’m not 
one to look into preseason rankings, 
but the Beavers were predicted to fin-
ish sixth in the conference. The reason 
I don’t usually look at these rankings 
is because they are based on complete 
speculation, though I did casually glance 
at them this year. As expected, the rank-
ings by the head coaches predicted USC 
to have a plethora of talent. From what 
everyone has seen from USC destroying 
Ohio State University, the University of 

place, respectively. 
“During the race, Jake and I were 

trying to run [Lock Haven] down,” 
Morrill said. “So at the end when we 
beat them, we were pretty proud.”

Helping to secure that victory were 
seniors Greg Goldmine and Kevin 
Klein, collecting 15th and 20th place, 
respectively. 

“We came into this race talking 
about what we needed to do, and the 
runners, man to man, took that up,” 
head coach Nate Garcia said.

The women’s team opened up its 
6,000-meter run with freshman and 
twice-named California Collegiate 
Athletic Association Female Runner of 
the Week Bre Schofield anchoring sev-
enth place with a time of 22:41.

Nine seconds later came senior cap-
tain Ashleigh Montgomery to round 
out the 11th-fastest time of the day. 
Freshman Elena Inouye also turned in 
an excellent run as the third Triton fin-
isher with a time of 23:30. Ultimately, 
the Triton women earned a total time 
of 116:46 and 125 points to claim 
fourth overall. Surpassing UCSD by 
18 points, Cal State Los Angeles and 
Slippery Rock University tied for first 
with 107 points. 

UCSD’s next race looks especially 
exciting for the harriers as both teams 
return home to compete in the Triton 
Classic on Oct. 11. According to Morrill, 
two major prospects will remain on the 
forefronts of the Tritons’ minds. 

“Alaska Anchorage — they’re one 
of the teams on our radar that we are 
watching out for at the Triton Classic,” 
he said. “And of course we want to win 
the division.”

Virginia and the University of Oregon 
— the other Oregon team — the pre-
dictions about the Trojans’ talent were 
accurate. USC is talented, but if the 
sixth-best team of the conference can 
take down the undisputed number one, 
it reveals that there is a wealth of talent 
within the Pac-10 that goes unnoticed. 

In fact, USC has lost three times to 
Oregon State since 2000, and for the 
last two years has lost two games a year 
— only to Pac-10 teams. During these 
years, the Trojans finished third and 
fourth in the final seasons’ rankings 
after dismantling their nonconference 
opponents in their bowl games. 

From this precedent, it’s hard to 
argue the Pac-10 is weak, but the glaring 
stat this year is its dismal 1-6 record ver-
sus the Midwestern Conference. Here 
are the facts: the Pac-10 has dealt with 
injuries to key players; many of its losses 
came on the road; and, i’ll admit it, the 
MWC is improving. Despite its poor 
record versus the MWC, the entirety of 
the Pac-10 has dealt losses to Ohio State, 
Michigan State, Purdue University and 
the SEC’s own University of Tennessee 
— and it wasn’t just the Trojans who 
won these games. 

Like I said before, there are les-
sons to be learned from Oregon State. 
A lesson that in this day and age, any 
team has a chance and rankings don’t 
mean a thing until late in the year. We 
can talk and analyze all we want about 
who has the best conference and team, 
and we will continue to do so, but we 
won’t know until the season is over. 
Talk is just talk, and though it adds to 
the splendor of college football, builds 
rivalries and adds to the fun of being 
a fan, it really means nothing — unless 
of course it’s your team that is doing 
the winning.

her best night of the year with 20 
kills and only one error on .463 
hitting, while Schmidt, the CCAA 
player of the week, finished with 16 
kills on .333 hitting to go along with 
five digs and four aces. 

The Tritons will return home

RIMAC Arena. 

“We are a young team, but we

There are no longer any links ana-lyzing week five of the college football season on ESPN’s Web 
site. No more glorious stories about the 
Oregon State Beavers toppling the No. 
1 ranked perennial powerhouse USC. 
Nothing but news and analysis of week 
six, because that is the nature of college 
football — it continues whether you 
want it to or not. Every week there’s 
a new story about underdogs taking 
down giants and more analysis done 

than necessary or thought possible. If 
I could, I’d like to regress to that fateful 
Thursday (not just because I’m a die-
hard Beaver fan), because I truly believe 
there are lessons to be learned. 

Of all the talk going into the show 
down, most of it was about how the 
Pacific-10 Conference was weak and 
how USC was the only team worth 
mentioning. While it may be true that 
USC was the lone team representing 
the Pac-10 in the top 25 in the fifth 
week as compared to six teams from the 
Southeastern Conference and four each 
from the Big 12 and Big 10 Conferences, 
rankings early in the season mean noth-
ing. At the end of that week, nine ranked 
teams had fallen, including six teams 
taken down by unranked nobodies. The 
losers included the SEC’s No. 3 Georgia 
and No. 4 Florida.

Some would go on to point out that 
Georgia lost to No. 8 Alabama, and 
Florida was put down by Ole Miss, both 
SEC opponents. Many analysts would

CROSS COUNTRY — Returning from 
a two-week break, UCSD’s cross coun-
try teams bolted into action on Oct. 4 
when the Tritons competed in the Pre-
National Invitation at Cooper’s Lake 
Campground in Slippery Rock, Pa. In 
the fourth event of the season, the men 
claimed their third team title while the 
women seized a fourth-place finish. 

Sprinting toward the finish line with 
a time of 25:24, senior Jake LeVieux led 
the pack of Triton victors with a fourth-
place finish. It was the fourth straight 
time LeVieux has led the Triton runners 
and finished among the top five.  

Not far behind LeVieux were junior 
Jesse Morrill and senior Gabe LaMothe, 
finishing fifth and eighth respectively, 
helping the Triton men claim their 
third team title. UCSD won first place, 
trumping Lock Haven University by 17 
points. Lock Haven proved a worthy 
competitor as the Eagles’ Nick Hilton

MEN’S WATER POLO — For the sec-
ond time in a week, the No. 10 Tritons 
found themselves up 5-1 at home only 
to end up with a loss. In a game similar 
to the matchup against No. 6 Loyola 
Marymount University one week ear-
lier, UCSD could not hold on to a com-
manding first-half lead against No. 8 
UC Irvine on Oct. 3, eventually falling 
to the Anteaters by a score of 10-8. The 
loss brings the Tritons’ record to 11-4 
on the season.

UCSD came out looking fresh 
against the Anteaters despite earning a 
hard-fought 12-10 victory over No. 7 
Cal State Long Beach the night before. 
Senior driver Adnan Jerkovic, who 
scored four first-half goals, and junior 
two-meter Daniel Garcia, who added 
two of his own, led the Tritons. UCSD’s 
straight press on defense and impressive 
play from freshman goalkeeper David 
Morton held off UC Irvine’s two-meter 
play to give UCSD a 6-3 lead at half-
time.

The third quarter was downright 
ugly for the Tritons, with their defense 
completely crumbling and their six-
on-five offense ineffective. UC Irvine 
dominated the physical play inside in 
the third quarter.

“We put too much in the fact that 
we were winning in the first half,” 
senior driver Chance Vermilyea said.

WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL — After 
taking down ranked California 
Collegiate Athletic Association con-
ference opponents — including No. 
1 Cal State San Bernardino — in last 
week’s matchups, the UCSD women 
had mixed results from its week-
end games. The Tritons slipped up 
against Chico State on Oct. 3, fall-
ing in five sets, 25-23, 20-25, 25-19, 
16-29, 15-11 at Acker Gym before 
defeating Cal State Stanislaus on 
Oct. 4 to bring their record to 12-3, 
6-2 CCAA. 

Though disappointed with the 
loss last Friday, the Tritons were 
resilient and came back the follow-
ing night, taking down Cal State 
Stanislaus (4-14, 1-7 CCAA). In the 
match, the Tritons came out strong 
from the start, but had to elevate 
their play in the fourth set to fend 
off the scrappy upstart Warriors, 25-
17, 25-21, 21-25, 27-25.

UCSD regained its winning form 
in the Saturday night game, hit-
ting .345 while holding Cal State 
Stanislaus to .043 in the first set. 
Using several 5-0 runs early on, the 
Tritons held a 13-7 lead before the 
Warriors seemed to know what was 
going on. Freshman outside hitter 
Hillary Williamson was a major con-
tributor to Cal State Stanislaus’ woes, 
recording six kills in seven swings 
with a .857 hitting percentage. 

In the second set the Warriors 
fought to recover from the previous 
round, but had to contend with the 
Triton duo of senior outside hitter 
Rebecca Bailey and junior outside 
hitter Sylvia Schmidt. After falling 
behind 12-11, the Tritons came back 
to take the lead, and were ahead 22-
20 when Schmidt put down back-to-
back kills and Bailey finished off the 

“Personally, I think that everyone felt 
the game was over.”

The Anteaters opened the second 
half with seven unanswered goals until 
junior two-meter defender Steven 
Donohoe scored on a penalty shot with 
4:12 left in regulation. UCSD added 
another goal but it was too little, too late 
for the Tritons.

Offensively, the Tritons had major 
struggles with their man-up offense, 
with their only six-on-five goal coming 
in the last two minutes of regulation.

“It’s bad enough that we went one 
for nine on six-on-five opportunities, 
but they scored three times off of our 
six-on-five,” Harper said. “That’s as bad 
as it gets.”

  The loss came after UCSD went on 
the road to beat Cal State Long Beach 
for the first time this season. Of the 
Tritons’ four losses this season, two of 
them came at the hands of the 49ers.

“It was an awesome team win that 
took all of our players to get that out,” 
senior driver Sidd Menon said. “The 
loss [against UC Irvine] killed it a little 
bit for us.”

Even though Harper acknowledged 
the difficulty of playing back-to-back 
games against ranked opponents, he 
was baffled as to why the Tritons con-
tinue to give up significant leads.

“We’re not sure what’s happening, 
we just spent a fair amount of time talk-
ing about what was going on,” he said.

According to Menon, UCSD may 

have an opportunity for redemption 
when the Tritons take part in the 
Southern California Tournament in Los 
Angeles on Oct. 11 and Oct. 12. The 
Tritons will face Cal State Long Beach in 
the first round of the tournament.

“If we beat Long Beach there’s a 
good chance we will face UC Irvine or 
LMU in the tournament,” he said.

set with the final kill. 
Junior setter Elaine Chen, UCSD’s 

assist leader, had 29 assists through 
the first two sets and was concen-
trated on getting her team to polish 
its game. 

“We wanted to focus on our side 
of the court and what we were doing 
as a team rather then worry about 
what the other team was doing,” 
Chen said. “Our plan was to stay 
focused and composed, and for the 
most part, I think we did that. “

However, the young Cal State 
Stanislaus team was able to sneak 
one out from under the Tritons in 
the third set, staying even or just 
ahead for almost the entirety of the 
set. Tied at 21, the Warriors made 
their move and scored four straight 
points, the final three by forcing 
UCSD errors, to take the win. In 
the fourth and final set the Warriors 
put up a valiant effort, tying up the 
match 12 times and even leading 22-
18 before Schmidt took over and led 
the Tritons to take the match. 

Schmidt finished the night 
with 20 kills on .457 hitting, while 
Williamson recorded 11 kills and a 
team-high 10 digs. Senior standout 
Bailey also had 11 kills and moved 
to within 10 of the UCSD school 
record set by Stacy Dunsmore with 
a career total of 1,172 kills.

The No. 12 Tritons dropped the 
game against Chico State, despite 
at times playing well throughout 
the match. Senior outside hitter 
Kimberly Carpenter thought the 
team put out a good effort, but just 
wasn’t quite clicking. 

“We let the new environment get 
to us and we didn’t play our game 
the entire time,” Carpenter said. “We 
let them determine the pace of the 
game whereas we usually dictate the 
pace and play our game.”

UCSD led in the first set 13-4 
before the Wildcats fought back and 
rallied to take the opener behind 
the play of senior setter Erica Brick. 
Brick totaled five aces for the match, 
with four in the opening set. In the 
second set, the Tritons came back to 
win under the leadership of Schmidt 
and Bailey, who had four and three 

kills respectively. 
The third set was handled by 

Chico State, which ended the set 
on a 4-0 run despite the efforts of 
Chen, who recorded 11 assists for 
the set. In the next set, the Tritons 
started slowly but exploded at the 
finish and seemed to be in control 
of the Wildcats. In the most lopsided 
set of the match, the Tritons had six 
players record kills, with the final 
set-winning kill from sophomore 
middle blocker Cara Simonsen. 

Though the Tritons had momen-
tum heading into the fifth and final 
set, they couldn’t quite put it togeth-
er to pull out the win. In a struggle 
with multiple lead changes, Chico 
State eventually pulled away to take 
the win. 

The match had nine lead changes 
and was tied 21 times, as both teams 

The women’s volleyball 
team was unable to
