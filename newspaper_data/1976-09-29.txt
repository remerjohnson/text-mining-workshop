PBe Urges New Economic Policy 
(CPS) - The year of the U.S. 

Bicentennial may almost be over, 
but the People's Bicentennial . 
Commission (PBC) is not about to 
allow that fact to curtail its ac-
tivities. 

According to PBC' Chainnan 
Jeremy Rifkin, "The PBC is de-
emphasizing its focus on history 
and is now focusing on economics 
... the bicentennial is over. But the 
critical work of challenging the 
economy must go on in the years 
ahead." In September; the group 
changed its name to the People's 
Business Commission and vowed 
to continue its efforts to "declare 
independence from big business. " 

The PBC advocates employee-
owned and operated businesses: 
Thus, RUkin explained, the grQUp 
differs from both capitalism ~nd 
socialism as these economic 
philosophies are practiced in most 
counbies. "We don't want a bunch 
of bureaucrats in Washington to 
replace those on Wall Street. We 
want the economy decentralized." 

In addition to offering lectures on 
campuses nation wide, the PBC 
plans to publish several books on 
economics and history to offer an 
"alternate view." In the past, 
more than 5000 schools have used 
PBC pamphiets, books, and audio-
visual materials. 

Despite criticism from 
established economists, PBC's 
ideas have been proven effective, 
according to PBC staff worker 
Randy Barber, who cited several 
examples of successful cor-
porations utilizing a worker-
controlled format, including 
International Group Plants, a 
Washington D.C. life insurance 
company with over 400 employees. 

The PBC will be moving into 
electoral politics this fall with a 
series of programs designed to 
elect state legislators committed to 
racial ideas. The group will en-
dors no presidential or 
congressional candidates, because 
none have addre8led themselves to 

the "democratization of the 
economy," concentrating instead 
on the state legislatures, which 
they believe would be a good forum 
for the group's ideas. 

"A patriotic movement is needed 
to reclaim democratic principles; 
to challenge the subversive ac-

tivities by corporations," Rifkin 
concluded. "We have decided to 
launch the PBC because we do not 
believe that America's economic 
future shouid rest in the very 
corporate and political hands that 
have plunge4 us into this crisis in 
the first place." 

Coop Discusses Year's 
Plans in First Meeting 

by Jim Mulryan 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD Student Cooperative Union's (Coop) first meeting of the 
year was held Monday night and consisted of a series of reports on 
summer activities and plans for the coming year. 

Reports presented to the 70 people in attendance came from the 
Appointments and Evaluations (A&E) coordinator, representatives of 
the Student Center Board, the Student Activity Fee Group and the Task 
Force on Student Governance, and members of the External Affairs 
support group. 

AilE Responsibilities 
ME coordinator Mark Fingennan first described his committee's 

responsibilities, which are to appoint at-large undergraduates to campus-
wide committees, keep track of their performances and to provide means 
to settle internal conflicts in the Coop. 

Fingerman told of one such potential setUement. Friday at noon in the 
Student Organizations Conference Room, A&E will hold an open hearing 
on " internal conflicts" in the Coop's External Affairs support group. 

Fingerman also mentioned work that A&E did over the summer. One 
such project was a proposal-written by Fingerman and Bob Simon-for 
payment of students on campus-wide committees. Fingerman said that 
the Advisory Committee on Student Fee Programs has adopted the 
proposal in concept, but was unable to put it into effect because of the lack 
of funds. 

Matt Gravatt of the Student Center Board (last year's Board of 
Authority) told Coop members about a possible conflict between board 
members ~nd Vi~hancellor and Dean of Student Affairs George 
Murphy. 

Gravatt said that Murphy has been trying to shrink the b . rd' pow rs 
. all through the summer. 

"Get the Coop" 
Student governance task force member Steve Lopez reportcd about th 

committee's summer activities (Triton Times, pt. 27) . Student 
response to the task force was basically hostile. They vi wed th \ ta k 
force as Chancellor MElroy's att mpt to "G t the oop." 

In other developm nt , two of the three position on th Chalrpcr.'on 
Pool were opened wh II .Jeff Fri d and alternat Matt Gr v t r 'igll d. 
Several persons w re nominated to fill the open posilton, but 
nominations were left open through next Monday. They can be submitt d

of the Student Center. 

Carter Combines Promises, 
Smiles In San Diego Visit 

by Sara J. Lowen 

Jimmy Carter's San Diego a~ 
pearance Saturday ranged from a 
folksy stump speech at the San 
Diego Zoo to the release of a 
detailed nuclear power statement, 
which suggested that he was 
warming up for his foreign policy 
debate with Pres. Ford next week. 

Accompanied by Gov. Brown 
(who, for the most part, got more 
applause than Carter did), Carter 
made three speeches, criticizing 
the Ford Administration's nuclear 
weapons policy, addressing the 
problems of the aged to a senior 
citizens group; and talking about 
endangered species at the San 
Diego Zoo.) 

The consistent theme of his 
speeches was the lack of leader-
ship in Washington. 

Speaking to a group of 400 at the 
City Club, Carter blamed Ford's 
lack of leadership in curbing the 
spread of nuclear weapons for the 
dangerous international situation 
that exists today. 

when we fail to provide leadership, 
the international world drifts." 

In a speech to an enthusiastic 
audience of senior citizens at the 
Cedar Community Center, Carter 
gave his standard stump speech, 
talking about the simple things in 
life that people deserve: clean air, 
safe neighborhoods, respect. 

He mentioned that his mother, 
Miss Lillian, and he work in the 
Peace Corps as an example of what 
an active senior citizen can ac-
complish. Carter told the senior 
citizens that, if elected, he would 
increase the amount they could 
earn without losing Social Security 
benefits. He also said he would 
appoint an advisor to give the 
senior citizens' perspective on his 
programs.

hostess for the following school 
year. 

No one knows why this column 
began, where it's going, or where it 
will end. 

What is it, you ask? Well 
?? /lil/? ? It's a question and an-
swer column, an advice colwnn, a 
no nonsense column, a gossip 
column, and a whatever is up 
column. 

We challenge you to send us 
questions you think we can't, or 
won't answer. BeCause, we can and 
we will. Or just send in questions 
you'd Ilke to have answered. 

Send the questions and the gossip into the Triton Times office, at the 
Student Center, in care of "What's Up?" The column will appear e~ch 
Wednesday, so we need your questions by Friday at three. 

Here are some of the questions submitted for today--
Dear Doc: What year is it on the Jewish calendar? 
Today Is the fiftb day of the first month of the year 5737. That's a lot 01

Dear Doc : Why are the parking pennits so expensive? 
They're DOt, tbey just seem that way. Student permits cost $48.00 for a full 
year, or $4,08 per month. This is wby It only costs students $31.00 wben 
they buy their permits In September: This translates Into a cost of 16.7c 
per day for parting. Comparatively, parking fees for studeDts at UCSF 
are $256 per year; at UCLA It's $198 per year; aadat Berkeley It's," per 
year. UCSD fees bave not heen increased since 1968. State funds for 
parking facUlties were cut In 1958 since "parking was not Incidental to 
educatloo". Eacb campus Is required to bave Its parking s,I!f'Vlces sell

Dear Doc : Is UCSD cracking down on alcohol? And wasn't there a law 
passed recenUy allowing 18 years old to drink? 
The alcohol poUey bas not changed: no alcollol is allowed on campus. 
HOWEVER, this Is DOt always the case. Areas, such as dorm. rooms, are 
considered private areas and students will not be troubled about It inside 
their rooms. Outside the room Is public area and U alcobolls visible, It 
must lie removed. A committee bas beea formed to determiae If the 
present rules are too loose, [bardly] or too tight. Committee memben 
are Tom Brown [Student Affairs], Beverly Varga [Tblrd College Dean],

Seeking Spiritual Enlightenffi'ent 
by~rryAu..o 

The future Is now. Time 
marches on, straight into your 
face. What you leave behind you 
cannot regain. 

You college students know this. 
You'll never get your innocence 
back, you jaded Intellectuals of 
the New Morality. "We've got to 
get ourselves back to the GarÂ· 
den?" No way. For better or 
worse, you'll never return to 
believing what you used to 
believe -you are a Product of 
these Turbulent Times. 

Many thinking people today are 
in this position. But you don't 
shrug off a couple centuries of 
history that easily. There's bound 
to be a conflict, and a lot of guilty 
feelings. 

A' good example of thiB is in the 
area of religion. I know a lot of 
people who have cast aside the 
beliefs oi their faml1le.s as outÂ· 
dated, foolish, superstitious. 
They don't want to follow a faith 
just because their parents 
happen to. They seek out a form 
of spiritual enlightenment they 
can call their own. 

But, like a shopper in Safeway 
looking over brands of detergent, 
the choices are so vast that the 
Seeker of Wisdom is overÂ· 
whelmed. How can he pick the 
right Path to Awareness? After 
all, it 's a hell of a lot easier to 
become a pagan these days. 

For many, the claims and 
counterclaims of various 
religious sects become so conÂ· 
fusing that their final decisions 
are often based on relatively 
mundane factors . Like : which is 
the most convenient? 

A friend of mine at UC Santa 
Cruz is currently doing 
missionary work for the ChlD'Ch 
of the Convenient Faith, a cult 
'which is a phenomenon of our 
age. Like certain other faiths, it 
teaches that God is All Things 
and that all religions are 'equally 
correct, including those so ob-
scure that you've never even 
heard <i them. 

Therefore, the practice of one 
faith above another iB sure to 
offend some manifestation of 
God. But this is bound to happen, 
since only a schizophrenic can 
believe all things at once. So, 
since you're going to have to pick 
one faith - one interpretation of 
God anyway - wby not pick the 
most convenient one? 

Some cult members carry 
around little picnic forks as their 
personal form of the Great Spirit, 
mostly because it's easy to do and 
if you lose one, you can always 
buy a package of them for 95 
cents or so at the store. Of course, 
they feel guilty about this 
sacrilege toward<! the more 
established faiths , but , then, you 
can 't be too sure about the

Choosing ,A ~hilosophy: 
A Matter Of Preference 

by Ron Anbar 
Opinion EdItor 

Sometimes by the end of the sophomore year in college most of us 
have gotten around to thinking about our future life in te~ of our 
goals , man's purpose on Earth, and what we have to hope ~or m life. 

It appears to me that there are three basic ways to deal with these 
questions, which too often take up more thinking time than we like. And 
yet the answers we arrive at could be the essence of the rest of our lives. 

Religion is one of the ways to deal with these questions, and all that is 
left for us to do iB to adopt a religion as our own. 

Christiilnity, for ~xample, requires us to accept Jesus Christ as the 
Messiah. Once one does so, he is " given" the answers to the three 
questions: Our goal should be to follow the teachings of Christ tp the best 
of our ability. We can hope to do well at this and then be judged for the 
better when the final day comes. Finally, man's purpose on Earth is for 
God to know and it isn't up to us to really think about it. It should satisfy 
man, according to Christianity, to realize that he is part of God's master 
_no . 

Judaism, once accepted, gives the same sort of basic answers: Our 
goal is to follow God's word. our hope is that we do this well, and it is not 
up to us to figure out why God placed man on Earth. 

Although I am not acquainted with any other religions, I get the imÂ· 
pression that it is the answel'l! to the three fundamental questions that 
holds all religions together, and in fact accounts for their appearance on 
Earth. 

A second way to deal with the questions is to ignore them. Just like one 
may ignore the fact that a final is only four days away and still not pick 
up a single text from the class. The day does come when one is 
penalized, 

The same holds true, I believe, if one does not deal with these 
questions and arrive at a satisfactory answer. Ways of ignoriJIII them 
include drugs, which seem to help ignore many other problems, acÂ· 
cepting a religion without really thinking about it, and simply avoiding 
all contact with the questions (which would mean you are not reading 
this article.) 

The final way to deal with the questions is in a non-religious way. (At 
least not by accepting an existing religion.) Christianity, for example, 
certainly did not begin by accepting a " current" religion. Instead, Paul 
developed it in his writings. 

In this same way it is possible for anyOlle to develop his or her own 
philosophy of life (possibly by borrowing heavHy from existing 
religions. )

Commentary . 

More Arms Mean Peace? . ~ 
by Jeff Fenton 

In recent years, Russia has 
greatly expanded her military 
forces. The Red Army now stands 
as the world's largest, with active 
and reserve forces of fifteen 
million men. 

The Soviet Navy now surpasses-
the U.S. Navy in overall strength, 
and could cut off vital raw material 
shipments at any time. The Red 
Air Force possesses highly ad-
vanced aircraft in large numbers, 
and Soviet nuclear missiles, exÂ· 
panded in violation of the already 
weak arms-limitation agreements, 
now provide overbearing 
superiority . 

attack in Europe, their manpower 
and weapons superiority would 
enable them to present us with a 
" fait accompli : " a quicklyÂ· 
conquered Continent. 

At present, Europe is at peace, 
and there has been no serious crisis 
since the 1968 Soviet suppression of 
liberalism in Czechoslovakia . 
Genuine efforts have been made 
since then to reduce European 
tensions, and intra-German and 
East-West political, cultural, and 
trade relations have improved. 
However, under this surface lie 
grave threats to European peace 
and security. 

When he dies, prcrSoviet elements 
may seek to revolt, and Russia 
may choose to enter, thereby 
upsetting the balance of power: 

To counter a Russian attack, our 
President might find it necessary 
to press the buUon and initiate 
nuclear ' holocaust. A strong ,Con-
ventional land, sea, and air force 
could help us avoid nuclear war by 
allowing \IS to meet the Soviet 
attack initially on equal terms. At 
least, we would be able to hold the 
fort on land long enough to rush 
over plenty of new reserves, 
weapons, and supplies.

We must have a strong con-
ventional strategic option, not just 
a nuclear deterrent. Our govern-
ment must chaMel increased 
effort into production of large 
numbers of tanks, guns, flgbter 
planes, missiles, navy ships, and 
other weapons. 

There still remain several 
trouble spots on the Continent. 
Berlin, focal point of crises in 1948 
and 1959, is calm, but Russia could 
again choose to make serious 
thr.ts. In Yugoslavia, Communist 
but independent and neutral in 
outlook, longtime leader Marshall

The Disabled Stadent Union 
(DSU) this year plal1S to continue 
its efforts toward weater ~ 
derstanding in students, faculty 
and community of the problems 
facing disabled students, ac-
cording to DSU member Jim 
LeBrecht. â¢ 

Started last fall, the DSU is an 
organization for persons who work 
for architectural and social change 
to help the disabled student. Its 
members include both disabled

and able-bodied students, because 
anyone can join in "the movement 
of disabled advocacy," says 
LeBrecht. 

CommllDlty Activities Also 
~though most of this year's 

. activities are yet to be planned, 
LeBrecht says that a greater stress 
will be placed on activities in the 
community as well as on campus. 

The DSU plans to repeat 
Disabled Awareness Week, which 
LaBrecht characterized as a 
highly successful event when it 
was held last May. A sign language 
class sponsored by the DSU is 
another good possibility for this 
year. Various movies and other 
events will also be sponsored. 

leBrecht is very optimistic 
about the new progz:ams coor-

pected to coordinate a range of

available to the disabled student, 
as part of his new duties. 

The DSU has worked for change 
in many areas at UCSD. It has 
brought about changes in building 
codes in such areas as curb ramps 
and ramps in buildings for easier 
access by wheelchairs. But 
leBrecht feels there is still more to 
be done. 

LeBrecht, a junior at Third 
College, feels the most profound 
changes 0 be made are in the 
attitudes of the UCSD students and 
faculty. He feels one of the most 
successful events in accomplishing 
this purpose was last year's 
awareness week. 

For three days seminars were 
held on such topics as sexuality 
and career planning for the 
disabled. Disabillty simulations 
were held in which wheelchairs 
were issued to the non-
handicapped and eyemasks were 
worn by the sighted. Through such 
simulations students, and ad-
ministrators were able to relate to 
some of the problems and 
frustrations suffered by the 
disabled.

Camping: no vacation is more family oriented, or provides a better 
escape from the urban rouUne as well as a chance to enjoy nature. That's 
what camping enthusiasts always tell me. I drew different conclusions 
from my camping adventures this sununer. ' 
â¢ Our camp was near Lake Lucerne, in clear and beautiful Switzerland. 
You could swim and fish in the lake or hike in the surrounding mountains. 
But most of the campers never saw the channs of Lake Lucerne. 

Less than 500 yards from the lake was camping Lido, a dirt lot cram-
med full of uneven rows of tents. It's hard to believe that the Swiss would 
allow this eyesore to exist within the boundaries of their country. 

The first priority of campers, upon arriving at their assigned square of 
dirt at camping Lido, is to recreate their home life style as much as 
possible. Their tents are multi-room dwellings with curtains and fake 
fireplaces. The tent assembled, they set a few lawn chairs in front to 
make the place look comfortable. Dad gets out a beer can, IIilbuttons his 
shirt, sits in one of the chairs and hardly moves for the duration of the 
vacation. Mom dons a bikini and g~ about her chores, hoping to calch a 
few rays when she isn't cooking on her miniature stove, washing dishes . 
under a faucet or doing the laundry in a bucket. 

They send the children off to the playground or the game room, figuring 
the kids can have fun }llaying ping pong. These game rooms are not 
always the wholesome places one would imagine. (At one campground, 
the game room was a smoke-filled pool hall where eager pre-teen girls 
went to be picked up by high school boys. ) 

Campers are often gregarious types, socializing with the neighbors, 
joining them for a hash dinner or a game. of bridge by flashlight. 
However, because of the close proximity of camping families in the tent 
suburbias, neighbors often fight. 

Our neighbors were in a bad mood from the start because they Â·had 
neglected to bring the requisite lawn chairs, subjecting them to the In-
dignity of having to squat in front oftheir tent all day long. Our sniggering 
at their predicament did nolhing to ease tensions. . 

One day as I was returning to our hut, the father of the squatters 
stopped me. â¢ 

"Would you move your laundry? It spoils our vie w. " 
"What view?" Their tent faced our hut, constructed of rotting boards 

and corrugated tin and the barbed wire fence behind it. I went back to 
str ing up more laundry on the line, but the man didn 't see the humor in 
the situation. 

"Look, my family wants to eat our meal without looking at your 
laundry." The guy was serious . 

"Sorry, there's no other place to hang the laundry, Besides, if you're 
going to stay in a cheap place like this, you can' t expect a view." 1 won-
dered what this aesthete was doing in a tent slum like this. 

He persisted, taking a diplomatic tack, "You can move it over there," 
he said, pointing to a spot to the side of our hut that I had not seen before. 

"Okay, if it really offends you," I said, moving the laundry. 
Infinitely relieved, the family squatted down to dinner, happily eating 

hash from their tin plates. I'd had enough of the tent metropolis-I took off 
for Lake Lucerne.

Carter's 

Protest ... 
However, no one could know that 

the Prop. 14 supporters favored 
Carter, as they only carried signs 
about their proposition. When 
asked why, Joe Smith, an 
organizer, said that no one had 
offered them any Carter signs. 

Some secret support for Prop. 14 
was noted when, at the Senior 
Citizens' Center, a young Carter 
staff-person pinned a "Yes on 14" 
button to his coat, on the inside 
lining. / 

UDConditlooal Amnesty 
The final groups ofÂ· pickets to 

meet Carter Saturday favored an 
unconditiOfllll amnesty for all draft 
evaders and armed forces 
deserters. This group feels that 
Carter, while progressive on the 
amnesty issue, hasn't gone far 
etlough in his position. . 

But the group is much harder on 
Ford. According to organizer 
Richard Clark, of the statewide 
Coalition of Veterans for Human 
Rights, the President lacks sen-
sitivity on this issue. 

Clark took exception to Carter's 
analogy between Ford's pardon for 
Richard Nixon and his conditional 
amnesty for draft resisters. 

"Draft resisters can't be equated 

with Richard Nixon," Clark said. 
But Caner never heard that. The 

most he heard of any of the groups 
was a brief statement from Clark 
on the amnesty group's position. 
His only real perception of the 
presence of the groups was the 
same as those who watched on the 
evening news : split-second shots of 
a montage of signs. 

"CI,lrter - Were you a planned 
pregnancy?" A picture of an 
aborted fetus : "Forgive them 
Father, for they know not what 
they do." A baby Â·with a sign 
around his neck: " I'm glad my 
mother didn't abort me. '! "Support 
the Fannworkers Initiative." 
"The war-makers were wrong, not 
the war-protesters." 

That's what blared out at Carter 
Saturday. The final effect of it all 
won't be decided until Nov. 2. 

Smiles ... 
Carter related how he started his 

campaign with no national 
recognition and an orga niztion of 
three saying his campaign has 
succeeded "with the support of 
good old people like you."

Does Coed Dorm Living 
Cause Deviate Behavior 

Repeating a favorite campaign 
theme, he said, " lowe nothing to 
the special interest groups, I owe 
everything to the people. " 

Carter was still in the folksy 
style when he greeted a crowd of 
400 at the San Diego Zoo. Carter 
called his visit to San Diego a 
homecoming , and reminisced 
about visiting the Zoo 25 years ago 
when he was a naval officer

459-97 11 (CPS) - Does coed donn living 
mess up your head? Yes, no Â· and 
sort of, according to two Stanford 
University psychiatrists who 
reported their findings in Human 
Behavior Magazine. 

The pair quizzed 900 freshmen 
students at a large public school in 
a small town where most students 
live in university housing. They 
found that overall, coed donns are 
more pleasant, relaxed, friendly, 
enjoyable and that the atmosphere 
promotes greater persooal growth 
than single Â· sex living 
arrangements. 

They discovered men who opt for 
coed living have higher academic 
and career goals, like to drink beer 
and think of themselves as easy-
gOing and "on top of the world." 

Women in coed housing; 
however, were found to be quite 
different . than their female 
classmates living in women-only 
dorms. Women who lived under the 
same roof as men had higher Â·-
academic aSpirations, took part in 
more social and culturallCtlvlties 
and engaged in more of what the 
psychiatrists call "impulalve-
deviant behavior," which means 
they OCCasionally break scbool 
rulesand drink bard Uquor. 

These women also had a better 
self-image Â· than other university 
fi rst year women, they described 
themselves u "easygoing," they 
were less likely to view themselves 
as cauUpus and they placed more 
emphasis on frlendahlp, in. 
dependence and varifty in new 
activities. They also placed leu 
emphasis on traditional 
heterosexual dating. 

One year later the biggest 
change for students living In coed 

dorms was a drop in career goals. 
Fewer students still wanted to get 
that doctorate degree that llad 
seemed so important several 
months earlier and they looked 
with more disfavor on demanding 
caree.rs than dil;i other students 
who didn't live in coed housing. 

The two psychiatrists also report 
that students from coed dorms 
made more trips to the student 
health center, indicating higher 
levels of stress in coed living. For 
the women however, it might not 
have been all that stressful; 21 
percent of them said they were 
visiting the health center for birth 
control information.

option to remove (as in brainwashing) this knowledge from ourselves. 
Thus the gaining of knowledge cannot be bad." 

This philosophy gives each man a goal (gaining knowledge ) a pur-~se (to gain an understanding of ourselves), and hope (that ~hat we

Thus each man is involved in my "plan" of gaining knowledge, and [

Harry Geise has combined 40 
years of experience in meteoroloc 
with an unbelievable ImaglnaUon 
and~for~to~ 
one of the most successful 
weathennen in the United States. 

Geise Is based at his con-
dominium in Coronado, working 13 
hours per day, doing about 40 radio 
broadcasts and predicting 
weather up to one year in advance 
for over 800 California growers and 

_ Stanford University. He is also 
seen on local television doing 
KGTV's Noontime News. 

Geise has been instrumental in 
originating a very simple approach 
to meteorology using only a 
weather map af!d temperature 
readings for his predictions. He I 
admits "the hardest part of my 
.work is the geography." Geise 
adds that "there are factors you 
learn to look for to indicate specific 
weather conmtions because the 
pattern of the weather repeats."

commercial time on stormy days, 
they would reach a larger 
audience, according to Geise. 

Weather aDd Wall Street 
Geise also said that It has been 

proven that more stock is sold on 
Wall Street during good weather. 
He thinks weather forecasting 
could become important to new 
corporations and industries selling 
stock to raise money for their 

. operation. He said, "If these 
companies could begin selling 
stock in good weather, they could 
raise more funding in a shorter 
amount of time, boosting their 
business tremendously. to

Life has not been easy for Ceise 

though. He is a living example of 
Â·the proverbial "self-made man." 
Coining from a poor family, Geise 
had to sell magazines outside of the 
Chicago subways to supplement 
his mother's income when he was a 
young boy. 

Geise related that he would stay 
when it was freezing cold outside 
while the other boys selling 
magazines would go home. He 
said, "People would say I was a 
gOOd salesman, but all it was was 
that I didn't freeze."

Surf's Up-
And Down 
In' La Jolla 

The eight miles of La . Jolla 
coastline offer discriminating 
surfers a variety or waves. They 
can choose among the playful 
beach breaks between La Jolla 
Shores and the rocks north of 
Scripps' Pier for some easy-riding 
fun waves, the fast breaking waves 
at Black's Beach, or the thick 
powerful waves which crash over 
La J olla's jagged reefs if they 
prefer to experience a more in-
tense situation. 

Although outstanding surf 
arrives infrequently, the waves are 
ridable somewhere in the La Jolla 
area nearly every day. The South 
swells of summer, the North swells 
of winter, the year-round West 
swells, and local wind swells are 
well received, providing year-
round enjoyment. 

On most good days, every sur-
fing spot in the area is crowded. 
This is mainly due to the high 
concentration of surfers in the San 
Diego area. If you don't feel like 
battling the crowds at La Jolla's 

- surfing breaks, you can head up 
the coast into the less crowded 
North County regions. 

Now that school is underway, 
campus surfers can look forward 
to the quality falltime surf and 
hope that sometime soon the waves 
will return to their fonn of last 
year's opening week.

New Games and America's 
Bastard Athlete 

"Yeah, yeah, yeah, [ hear what you're saying. New Games: soft wal 
and creative play. 'Play hard, play fair, nobody hurt. ' 'Winning isn't 
everything, it's nothing.' sense of achievement and satisfaction come 
simply from the fun of participating, cooperating, and playing with, not 
against, one another. 

"Sounds to me like this New Games thing is just a lot of pussy-footin' 
hippie bunk being laid on us by those soft-hearted, peace-loving' punks. 
the nonÂ·meating types, that are afraid of any head-to-head fighting. 

"I mean, when I playa -game, I play to win. Or I at least wanna show 
my stuff. Do my thing. you know. A man wants to feel like a man! " 

Uh, I was a bit skeptical prior to the New Games tournament held this 
past Sunday in the UC San Diego Main Gym. 

â¢â¢â¢ Nearly three-hundred people are in the gym, separated into two groups 
by a rope strung high between the two sets of bleachers. The rope serves 
as a net. The' two groups, teams, are playing Infinity Volleyball. But the 
ball being used is this eno,nnous green thing, six-feet in diameter, too 
bulky, and bouncy for anyone person to handle. It's called an Earth Ball. 

"Control It! Control It! Lei it down so everyone can 'g~i their hands on 
It! " 

Twenty pairs of hands stabilize the Earth Ball from below. More hands 
strain to touch It. to feel It, to be a part of It and the game. 

And then there is this sudden great surge of energy - did someone say 
"Now!"? Did the Ball give the message? The Big Globe is lifted. passed, 
tossed, heaved far above the rope to the other side of the gym, where it 
bounds erratically about, not on the floor, but on more outstretched 
hands; hands that want to touch It, to hit It, to control It. so eve.ryone can 
jDin in for another return volley. 

I am a classic product of the American Sports System, that Bastard 
Athle~ more . common than any group of superstars, professionals, 
collegiate or high school sports performers. 

I am the Little Leaguer, the junior high flag football player, the high 
school all-around jock, the intramural athlete. entertaining at one time or 
Bn;other fantasies of playing in every one of the Big Leagues, but, despite 
mmor flashes of glory, defeated time and time again while attempting to 
rise to higher plateaus in the American Sports System, defeated by other 
hungry athletes, dominating coaches, and personal physical capabilities 
that are just t?o. daf!ln average, now relegated to following American 
Sports on teleVISIOn, ill newspapers, as a fan, idolizing Heroes, trying to 
reclaim lost glories in 'late 4lfternoon pick-up games, trying to keep in 

, shape for moments when physical skills might be called for where [ 
might still shine. _ ' 

I am the Bastard Athlete that New Games could never produce. 
â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢ 

"This game," says the New Games referee, "is called The Mating 
Game. Each one of you will either be a dog, a duck, a cow, or a cat. On the 
count ?f three, everyone close their eyes and begin making the sound of 
the ammal they are. The object is to find and join up with all the others of 
yourowntype. 

"One, two three .. ." 
The noise is deafening - Quack ! Quack! - and it seems impossible to 

distinguish - Moo! Moo! - one sound from another. But Meow! Meow! -
there's another cat! right there, grab ahold, don't let her get away, and 
now the both of you sound off, and soon there are others -Meow! MEOW! 
MEOW! - until finally itis like being part of one big happy litter. 

â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢ 
I play to win. But not because of any thrill-of-victory-agony-of-defeat 

BS. ~o, I play to win bec~use I want to perform to the best of my abilities 
and In the games America plays good performance is generally linked 
with winning. 

But in most New Games there are no winners or losers. In People Pass 
a game in which two lines of people crowd together shoulder-tD-shoulde; 
and front-to-back and unitedly pass individuals over their heads 
everyone's efforts are needed to keep the person in the air. And as each 
person is ha nded back, or after each person experiences a one-hundred-
hand back-butt-and-Ieg massage while six feet above the ground - after 
this, everyone feels like a winner. 

Or. in the. New ~ames Tug~f-War, where people are supposed to 
change ends if one Side gets too strong and begins to move the other side I 
said "Hey, I'm always on the losing side." ' 

" No! No !" someone corrected, " You're alwavs on the winDing side! "

More Joh .,r Grads 
(CPS) - Coll"ge students who 

graduated last pring had better 
luck finding em loyment than the 
class of 1975 according to a College 
Placement Council report. 

Women who completed un-
dergraduate degrees in 1976 did 
particularly well, the report said. 
They received 59 percent more job 
offerS than women who gr.aduated 
the previous year. While job offers 
for men with undergraduate 
degrees increased by only 4 per-
cent, women still accounted for 
only 19 percent of the jobs offered 
to bachelor degree graduates.
