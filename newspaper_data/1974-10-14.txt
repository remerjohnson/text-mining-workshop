State Senator H.L. ".111" Richardson, Republiun challenaef to 
AYn Cranston's US Senate seat, is pidured above answering 
reporters' questiom in the Triton Times office. 

Richardson, who favon cutbacks in goverrvnent spending, 
especially in. lOCiai areas, had intended to speak in the Revelle 
plaza, but decided to cancel because, said an aide, he didn't want 
to disrupt the "personal freedom" of those on the quad who- didn't 
want to hear him. 

However, a Triton Times staff member overheard a Richardson 
aide say the candidate did not want to speak in an open area , for 
lear of beinl shot upon by snipers.

North County In,orporgtion 

. Gove'rnntent Worth More Taxes? 
by Charles Heimler 

Is local city government 
worth an increase in already 
skyrocketing property taxes? 

That, is the question voters, 
including many members of the 
UCSD community, in the 
North County areas of leucadia, 
Encinitas, Cardiff, Olivenhain, 
and Solana Beach, will decide in 
the Nov. 4 election 

Ballot Prop. S qualifi d for the 
election last August follOWing a 
petition drive to coli ct 25 p r 

ent of the \ area 's voters 
signatures, a recommendation 
by lAFCO (local Agency 
Formation Commission) t hat the 
four communities tota l ing 
30,000 people should in-
corporate, and approval by the 
ounty Board of Superv isors. 

If the measure is approved, 
the four communit ies would be 
Incorporated Into the ci ty of San 
Dieguito, with a maximum tax 
rate of $ 72 p r $100 of ass ssed 
va luation For the owner of a 
$30,000 home, that means an 
additional tax of $54 could be 
add d to hiS tax bill 

But the Increase In tax SWill 
b less than that, according to 
th proposition's prop nents 

Ci tyhood backers f el the 
county government presently 
responsible IS slow and 10-
sensitive to the part icular 
prpblems and needs of the area. 
" It's the bas ic idea of. 
representation, " believes Don-
Parks, a Solana Bach home 
owner and co-chairman of the 
incorporation committee . 
" Wp'rp not ffec tively 

ounty governm nt and see no 
need to supplant It With local 
city government. " The county 
machrnery IS slow," says A l. 
Childs, co-owner of Solana 
lumber and treasurer of the 
STOP (Stop Taxing Overtax d 
Property) committee. " But It is 
ffective ." 
STOP'S argum nt that the tax 

Increase cltyhood would bring 
stirs sympathy from many 
property owners now feeling the 

, bite from the highest prop rty 
tax bills in California history 

Hut It IS the rapid ur-
banization and lack of land use 
planning that IS responSible for 
those ever rncreaslng tax bills, 
Parks contends, adding that 
cltyhood will In the long run be 
cheaper since developm nt and 
the extra services they reqUire 
can be planned rn the future 

"Four hundred houses means 
a new school which costs $2 
million," Parks pOints out "If 
the local community resid nts 
don't get control of ur-
banization they will have to 
k ep payrng for It "

-The Population Problem 
by Wesley Everest 

In the June 14, 1974 issue of Sdence magaZine, Roger Revelle 
wrote an editorial titled} 'Wi ll There Be fnough Food?" He wrote 
"Mankind may be drawing clOser to be a precipice where mass 
starvation occurs whenever drought or plant disease results in less 
than average crop production ." He goes on to say, " How can we draw 
back from the precipice? An obvious, difficult, but in the long run 
absolutely essential way IS through reducing rates of population 
growth." The rest of the editorial is devoted to Mr. Revelle's proposals 
for increasing supplies and coping with the immediate problems. 

The idea that curbing population growth is an answer to the 
problems of mass starvation is almost criminally deceptive. Naturally 
there is an upper bound on the number of people the earth can 
support : it has finite mass, for one thing. This fact, co.upled with the 
idea that per capita income is a measure of well bemg, makes the 
argument that fewer people will reduce starvation especially ap-
pealing. Nevertheless, we contend that large populations are .an· 
extremely minor problem in the world today, and that exces~l,":e 
population growth is a remote threat. This does not mean that It IS 
not a problem and should not be dealt with; we only .contend tha.t 
solving the population problem" will have only a negligible effect on 
the problems of starvation. 

How can this be? First one must examine the concept of "per capita 
income." Dividing the GNP by the number of people gives no in-
dication of how the GNP is distributed. If the · political system 
maintains a very rich elite and a starving peasantry, then a decrease 
in the population without a change in the political system will simply 
mean a smaller starving peasantry but a higher per capita income. 
Please note that the peasantry will still be starving. Unless the pat-
terns of the distribution of wealth are changed, hunger, deprivation, 
and even starvation cannot be eliminated 

Food: A Question of Economic Security 
A casual look at some data is revaling. Almost all underdeveloped 

countries in the "free world" have starving people. Does this mean 
they are "overpopulated?" Bolivia has a larger area than France. 
France had a population of 50,330,000 in 1969 and Bolivia had a 
population of 4,804,000. How could anyone think that curbi.ng 
population growth could help Bolivia? What the people of Bolivia 
must do is prevent their wealth from being stolen by the " investors" 
from other countries (yes, U.S. "investors" are the main thieves-
remember the Monroe doctrine) and then distribute equally among 
their people the wealth that they have. This may eliminate excessive 
wealth in Bolivia, but it is also the only way to-eliminate hunger . 

The idea that one can achieve effective population pl.anning in the 
absence of major economic planning is also quite amazing, and 
totally incorrect. (We are assuming, of course, that Mr. Revelle and 
his fellow travelers do not advocate the withdrawal of Third World 
countries from the capitalist arena.) In a country such as India, for 
example, having large numbers of children are a couple's only hope 
of avoiding starvation in their old age. Without any economic 
security at all, how can peasant Indians be persuaded not to have 
many children and thus forego any hope of avoiding starvation and 
misery? Furthermore, due to the intense poverty helped in part by the 
great inequities of wealth, ",any children in India die before they 
reach adulthood. 

. Thus to assure the survival of some children it·is necessary to have 
many. India's neighbor China, on the other hand, has an eHective 
population planning program . More important it has first achieved 
the prerequisite of economic security for its people. With the same 
amount of arable land" as the U.S., China has eliminated hunger, let 
alone starvation . The U.S. on the other hand, which has relatively no 
"population problem" cannot even feed its own people. There are 
blacks literally starving in Appalachia (read the NAACP ads in the 
New Yorker magazine) and the Los Angeles Times of October 5 
reports that 400 migrant farm workers are stranded in Iowa. The 
article claims, " many of the 400 are disease ridden, infested with 
parasites. Few have winter Clothes or blankets. Their food is running 
out." The article refers to the situation as a "human disaster area." 
This could not happen in China, and the reasons have absolutely 
nothing to do with numbers of people. 

China and Cuba: Enough Food 
Nor is China the only example. Frank Mankiewicz wrote after his 

visit lo Cuba that it was the only Latin American country that did not 
ha' ·e shantytowns with starving people, and in fact no one went 
hUligry . Recall that in 1958, before Castro came to power, Cuba had a 
poilUlalion of six million people. Five million of these people did not 
ev('n have a residence. Cuba managed to eliminate hunger without 
eliminating peo»/!:!. Olher "frpp world" Latin American countries stil l 
haue the vast majority of their people hungry, and many starving. 

Roger Revelle' s glib statement is a common error, resulting usually 
from ignorance and intellectual laziness. The other possibility is that 
Mr Revelle is aware of the true dimensions of the situation, and is 
le:ting himself be used as a propagandist for the few in thiS country 
wld derive great wealth at the cost of misery for most of the people 
01 the Third World. Thus he is either naive or dupl icitous. In either 
event he is the. man that Revelle college is named after. Let us hope 
(we fear in vain) that the students of Revelle College are not taught 
the " teachings" of Rog r Revelle .

not . And , conseque~tly, I issue a plea to who ever is

T1teatre: 

There is a certain Inherent 
danger that runs through the so-
called "Rock musical," " Rock 
Opera," and "happening" typ 
theatre experiences, in which 
everyone in the cast is supposed 
to be vital, fresh, full of love of 
life, and generally groovy all 
around. 

The intent often translates on 
stage as one gargantuan melting 

Aart-Vark 
The purpose of this little conglomeration of 

art happenings is to give to all of you an answer 
to that all too often asked question, "Ah, but 
what is theretodo?" The truth is, there's plenty to 
do around this place . One simply has to lind out 
where it's happening and how to get there. 

As far as boring weekend afternoons are 
concerned, one need go only as far as Balboa 
Park to find free artistic entertainment and 
inexpensive delights . The Fine Arts Gallery is 
now hosting an exhibition entitled, "60 Odd 
Provinces," a series of 70 colorful wood prints by 
Hiroshige. The master printmaker's works will be 
on display through October 20. Gallery hours are 
Tues. through Sat., 10 a.m. to 5 p .m . and Sunday 
12:30 p.m . to 5 p.m . 

The park also houses the Museum of Man, 
where Indian beadwork demonstrations run 
each Sat . 10 a.m. to 4 :50 p.m. The Reuben H . 
Fleet Space Theater is currently showing, 
"Cosmos ... The Universe of Loren Eisely," the 
"big bang" theory of the moment of the 
universe's creation. Beginning October 20, the 
Natural History Museum will be presenting a 
continuous film program including Dr. Suess' 
film "The Lorax," and "Cruise of the lac a," 
starring Errol Flynn. 

The abundance of small, private art galleries 
in the San Diego area is amazing. These galleries 
display fine a·rt created mostly by local San 
Diegans. I 

Through Oct. 20. the Artists Co-operative 
Gallery at 3731 India St. will be presenting 
recent print work by Mary Ellen Long with hand 
blown glass sculpture by Leo Ward . An exhibit of 
unique Cloisonne jewelry by Marcia Higgins in 
modern and medieval designs may be viewed at 
the Triad Gallery, 3701 Indii' St. A beautiful 
blend of rare plants and pottery is being 
9isplayed at the Jolin and Young Callery, 3719 
India at Washington . 

Perfonnina Am & Film 
The SanDiego Opera will be opening its 10th 

anniversary season with "Manon," an opera by 

Massenet Performances will be Wednesday, 
o t . 30 at 8:00 p.m., Friday, Nov. 1 at 8 :00 p.m., 
and Sun . Nov. 3 at 2:30 p.m. Student discount 
tickets for the opera are available at the Student 
Activities Center in the Arts and Lectures hall. 

On Oct. 18 and 19, the San Diego Ballet will 
present "Swan Lake," in it s opening per-
formance of the 1974-75 season . The ballet will 
be performed In the Civic Theater. Tickets are 
now available at the Civic Theater Box Office. 

Running through Nov. 10 at the Old Globe 
Theatre is the Rock-musical, Godspell. . Per-
formances run nightly (except Monday) at 8:00 
p.m ., with 2:00 p.m. matinees' on Sunday. 

I was able to attend the first in a series of 
Experimental Theatre films now showing as a 
special program at the Unicorn Theatre in La 
Jolla. The series consists of four programs every 
Wednesday during October. There are two 
performances each evening, at 7:00 and 9:00. 
Individual tickets are available . 

The first film, "Akrapolis," was perform.ed by 
Grotowski's Polish Laboratory Theatre, and 
proved to be a powerful, exciting, avante-garde 
trip into the minds of concentration camp 
prisoners. Upcoming films include "Paradise 
Lost" and " If I Could Turn You On," (to be shown 
Oct. 16), "Dionysius in '69" (Oct. 23), and "The 
Serpent" (Oct. 30). These selections will , I am 
certain, prove entertaining to film makers and 
dramatists alike. 

The Unicorn's regular presentations will in-
clude "The Conformist" (Italy-1970, directed by 
B. Bertolucci) and "The First Circle" (Denmark-
1972, directed by Aleksander Ford), to be shown 
Oct. 17-23; and "Demons" (Japan-1972, directed 
by Toshio Matsumoto) along with "The Dance of 
the Vampires" (USA-1%7, directed by Roman 
Polanski) which will be viewed Oct. 24-29. 

Here's a freebie for jazz enthusiasts. The Siln 
Diego State University Jazz Ensemble will 
present a program Oct. 20 at 3:00 in the Recital 
Hall at SDSU . 

Well, there you go folks. All sorts of goodies to 
keep you busy . Enjoy yourselves, yes? 

Godspell 
pot of one-dimensional toothy 
grins, half bearted " right ons!", 

. and youth capitalistic hype that 
stems from the deepest traumas 
of rock-induc d fantasy When 
"Hair" came to San Diego four 
years ago, thiS was certainly true . 
The road company was trYing so 
hard to be everything we ex-
pected them to be . "Bimbo's 
Cosmic Circus" was a case in 
point last year; a total disaster in 
theatre's clothing. 

Walking out on to the precipice 
of these precedents, the Old 
Globe Theatre started its winter 
season with "Godspell" Tuesday 
night, and Suprise! It's good. As a 
matter of fact, it' s not just good . 
In many ways it's a joy. 

"Godspell" is a musical , using a 
great youthful energy to relate 
the Gospel according to St. 
Matthews. Staged in an amor-
phous contemporary setting, 
suspiciously resembling a 
playground, eleven people come 
together and the gospel happens 
all around them. One person dons 
a pair of red, white, and blue 
overalls, a T-shirt with a 
Superman emblem on it and is 
Jesus. One is clad in tails and 
plays a various forces around 
Jesus : John the Baptist, Judas, etc. 
The other nine members of the 
company play out the enemies 
followers, animals, parables, and 
everything imaginable . 

Sound preachy? It's not ac-
tually. It is pleasantly Irrelevant 
and Irrev!:!rallt, in taking it' s 
gospel test and turning it into 
street rap . It's lighthearted, 
comic. and warm . 

The thing about the Globe 
production which makes it work 
is the attitude of the actors . 
Unlike so many productions of 
this gendre, the Globe's "God-
spell" is not drowning the 
audience in "with-it-ness." 

. Despits the shows' slickness (and 
Jack Tygett's extremely dynamic 
staging and choreography is 
certainly slick) the cast exudes a 
sense of freshness just in the 
relaxation with which they barrel 
through the show. The musical 
numbers are relaxed and easy, 
with no attempts to display 

operatic-like VOi ces getting In the 
way 01 the Simple warmth of the 
songs ThiS IS perhaps most 
graphically Illustrated In the 
SimpliCity with which Danna 
tvIongoven sang "Day by Day," in 
no way trYing to remind us as she 
sang that thiS was indeed the " hit 
song" of th show 

Perhaps most Impressive about 
the production was the fine sense 
of ensemble .maintained by the 
company. This held true even 
with the musicians and stagecrew 
who casually drifted in and out of 
the lighting throufhout the show. 
roth IS effect, I note I can barely 
single individuals out for special 
attention , save for Larry Car-
penter and DaVid lvIeyers who are 
easily recalled only in their skill 
and Sincerity In handl ing the two 
more or less specifiC rol es In the 
show The entire cast displayed 
Impr eSS ive performan ce 
capabiliti es, and I have to admit I 
can't Single out on weak apple In 
the bunch. 

The staging and choreography 
by Jack Tygelt was Visually 
exhilirating, and the lighting 
designed by Steph Storer par-
ticuliarly appealing. I don 't make 
any pretensions to calling thiS 
superb theatre, but the POint I 
couldn't help nollng was th is I 
was In a pretty "blah" mood when 
I went into the Globe Theatre last 
night, but I felt pretty damn good 
when I came out. It sure IS nice to 
Just plain enjoy a show once and
