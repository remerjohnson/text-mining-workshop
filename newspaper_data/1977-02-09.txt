UCSD Professor Popkin Maneuvered Presidential Debates 
by Alee NedelmaD 

Auoclate New. Editor 
"We wanted to win v ea, not debates," 

explained UCSD poUtical science professor 
Samuel Popkin in describing the strategy he 
designed for President carter to U!e in last 
fall's presidential debates. 

"We felt there was a 50-50 chance there 
would be debates," Popkin explained. This 
was why contingency plans for possible 
debates with either Gerald Ford or Ronald 
Reagan were drawn up as early as May, 1976, 
he said. 

chair Stuart Eizenstat in fonnulating the 
issues Carter would speak on. 

in the country , Popkin sa id. In addition, 
"Carter did very well on foreign policy by 
showing the public he knew what was going 
on" in the world. 

"The first point that was important about 
the debates was to make sure the national 
security and foreign policy debates were not 
first." Carter needed to set a tone in the first Commenting about the debates, Popkin 

said he felt the Playboy interv iew hurt 
Carter the most, politically. And, contrary to 
popular opinion, he said , Ford didn't lose 
votes over his statement about Soviet in-
fluence in Eastern Europe. Whatever votes 
he may have lost were compensated by 
Carter losing votes by appearing vindictive 
about the mistake, Popkin commented. 

Ford Better Debater debate he knew what was 
Popkin, in a recent interview with the 

Triton Times, described the important role 
he had in the carter presidential campaign. 

'One of my main contributiolll concerned 
the whole debate business," he said. "One of 
the things I did from May, (1976) on was to 
collect available data on debates in order to 
be able to put together a campaign plan." " 

popkin was part of the research group that 
worked with Pat CaddeU, carter's chief 
campaign pollster. Popkin had worked with 
Caddell before, during the McGovern cam-
paign, and served as the "inside man and 
utility infielder for the 76 campaign while 
Caddell was in Atlanta." 

According to Popkin, his research con-
cluded that Ford was a better debater than 
Reagan. Reagan he said, "couldn't handle 
questions under ire, while Ford was used to 
heavy questioning" from his service in 
Congress. 

If Reagan had been the Republican 
nominee, Popkin said he would have pushed 
for the candidates questioning each other. 
However, if Ford was the nominee, his 
research indicated, it would be disad-
vantageous to have Carter directly 
questioning the President. 

"Carter would win votes by showing he 
was concerned about the problems" facing 
the country, Popkin said. He added that this 
was more important than winning debates. 
"You win debates by being mean and nasty 
and cutting your opponent up." 

How to Use Mondale 
Another contribution Popkin said he made 

to the Carter campaign that ultimately 
proved decisive was the discovery of "some 
really important ways to use (Democratic 
Vice-presidential candidate Walter ) Mon-
dale. The. more people saw of Mondale the 
the more they thought of (Republican Vice-
presidential candidate Robert ) Dole ," he 
said. 

Because of an accident he suffered in 
December, 1975, Popkin was forced to 
remain at Caddell's cambridge Research 
Institute during the campaign. From that 
vantage he had the freedom to work in-
dependently of the everyday pressures in 
Atlanta. 

Popkin said he worked everyday with the 
debate team Connulating strategy. He aiso 
worked with Carter's new Domestic CoWlcil

Popkin felt that if Ford had chosen a 
reasonable vice-president, he would have 
won. "Dole killed him," he concluded.

PE Set For 
Pre-Enrolling 
Next Quarter 

by Vera M. I. Todorov 
Community Editor 

Those wonderful first days of the 
quarter when students rise at four 
in the morning, dragging them-
selvei and a blanket to the Gym to 
wait in line for a PE class they may 
not get, will become a thing of the 
past this spring when almost all 
physical education classes will be 
pre-registered. 

Athletic Director Judy Sweet 
says the PE Department is pre-
registering classes next quarter 
during the normal registration 
period with aU other classes in the 
"hope we'll be able to service the 
students in the best way possible." 

PE management services officer 
Marge Bartlett hopes we (the PE 
department) have tackled the 
problem of freshnien not getting 
into popular classes by reserving 
space for them. "We like the 
freshmen to get in," says Bartlet. 

She adds that students may only 
pre-register for one PE class and 
advises students to chose their 
favorite class and get their 
progvam cards in early. "On this 
first go round we're seeing how it 
works and which classes are most 
popular, so after classes have filled 
during the initial registration, any 
that don't fill wiD be open for the 
taking," Bartlett says. 

According to Bartlett, classes 
that will not be pre-registered are 
Advanced Scuba, Skin Diving, 
Surfing and Golf, which doesn't 
normaUy fill. 

Judy Sweet comments that PE 
classes were pre-regiatered long 
time ago but the method wu not 
too successful because a lot of 
students schedules were chlqlng. 

Bartlett explains that the 
department met with represen-
tatives from all the college 
prOVOlts' offices and the 
Registrar's office to dilcUSI 
alternatives to the relistertnc 
tectl'liq now in . She , 
they f I the "sign up" method is 
"ponderous and tiring" for 
stu nts.

Board Approves Coop 
Questions for Ballot 

By Paul Watry 
Staff Writer 

In a four to three vote Monday, the UCSD Elections Board decided to 
reverse a previous decision and approve the Student Cooperative Union 's 
Comprehensive Question Petition. 

Now, the petition which contains 29 questions, will be set before 
students in the upcoming campus referendwn set for the eighth week. It 
had been previously rejected because of failure to comply with standard 
election rules. 

Proponents of the petition claimed that the students have the basic 
right to receive "mandates from the whole student community" to im-
plement new programs and structures. 

"'Penon Support 
" In the fall of 1976," said petitton sponsor Vic Bloomberg, ··students 

became notified that the Chancellor had called for a referendum to either 
reaffinn or replace the Student Coop. We of the Coop promised in a Triton 
Times interview to have a comprehensive referendum. 

" We felt that whoever represents us should implement priorities 
established by the whole student commWlity. The support of 600 Coop 
members and the persistent political action of their representatives has 
fuUilled that promise." 

Opponents still argue, however, that the petition favors a special in-
terest group and has failed to meet the rules set by the students and the 
Election Board. 

The opposition is led by Muir representative Andy Schneider. 
Schneider's primary objection was that no attempt could be made by the 
students to halt the petition since it was submitted outside the rules set by 
the Election Board. 

"The elections board has altered its guidelines for a single special 
interest group. My principle is that the criteria ought to be equal for 
everyone. If the students had known that they could get s9mething on the 
baUot with only 250 signatures, there would have been a whole lot more 
petitions. " 

I/) According to Dave Ernst, ChanceUor McElroy's representative to the 
~ board, McElroy wasn't concerned with the Comprehensive Referendum 
§ Petition and "couldn't change it if he wanted to." 
iii Much of the argument during the meeting centered around Mont-
£ gomery Reed's and Vic Bloomberg's attempt to convince the Board £. members of the petition's importance. According to them, 90 per cent of 
~ the students who were asked to sign the Comprehensive Referendwn 

Petition did so.

Group Offers Fellowship for Recovering Alcoholics 
by Paal Watry 

Staff Writer 

"I was in high school when I 
discovered that I liked to drink," 
said one teenager. "At first, it 
was just on the weekends. It 
would make me relax sociaUy 
and help me to get along with 
others. Then it got worse, untU I 
felt that I couldn't Uve without 
drinking. " 

'lbough this may sound trite, 
stories like these have been told a 
thousand times by a thousand 
people. Each one is • Uttle dif· 
fenlt from another - but they aU 
stem from the same problem: 
'Ibe cUIeue of alcohoUlm. 

cc Alcoholilm a chranic Illness 
that many Umea leada to death if 
not ted or stopped, " ex-

plained Jim, a student workerfor 
Alcoholics Anonymous who asked 
that his last name not be given 
out. "A.A. is basically a 
feUowship of men and women 
gathered together to share their 
strength and hope with each 
other to recover from 
alcoholism. " 

The stories that occur because 
of alcohol are as varied as the 
people themselves. Along with it 
comes g~t losses. Sometimes, 
the loss is of family or friends. 
Many times it is a job. 

"The alcohoUc usuaUy In-
nocently starts with social 
drinking," Jim said. "He 
discovers alcohol as a form of 
relaution and escape from his 
problems. He continue to drink 
and eventuaUy his body becomes 

addicted. It is then that he 
usually starts drinking 
everyday; many times in the 
morning to relieve his hangovers. 

" People around him recognize 
his drinking problem . He 
pretends not to, but deep down 
he's aware of his habit. This is 
when he starts drinking to escape 
his drinking." 

The Club 
The Club, as A.A. is known to 

its members, was started in 1939 
by two alcoholics to promote that 
"the power to quit drinking ('tift 
and should come from inside the 
person." The first step towards 
this, they said, was (or an 
alcoholic to realize for himself 
tbat he reaUy is an alcoholic. 

"What Alcoholics Anonymous 
does," Jim id IS to help the 

problem drinker stop drinking 
one day at a time. It would be too 
overwhelming for 8 person to 
think that he will stay sober for 
the rest of his Ufe, so he puts hi 
conscious effort only into the day 
he is living at present. " 

Alcoholics Anonymous ae-
C(,mplishe this through a sort of 
group therapy, where alcoholics 
get together to share their ex-
periences. The " Program" is 
ba ied upon 12 steps each con-
tributing to an eventual recovery. 

"Though an alcoholic can 
never really recover com-
pletely, t, c1ctlmtd Jim, 
"Alcoholics AnonytllOUl at least 
can be , and usually is, I turning 
point for the lives of toousancb 
who com to it for help."

Right to Clean Air · Bike Shop Article Oarified 
ChanceUor McElroy's order to ban smoking in classrooms and teaching 

laboratories Is a long overdue step in the direction of creating a better 
atmosphere on campus. 

There are severa I good reasoos to support the Chancellor's action; 
-It brings the campos uJHo-date with progressive communities 

tbrougbout the country wbleb have realized the bazards of unleashed 
smoking and 80 outlawed smoking in public areas; 

-It recognizes that smoking serves as an irritant to non-smokers. 
UCSD physical education researcher James R. White bas determined 
that cigarette smoke Increases anxiety and reduces the attention span of 
DOn-smokers within Its proximity; 

-It acknowledges IIClentific research sbowing cigarette smoke to be 
hazardous to DOn-smoken near a penon who Is IImokbt. 

There wID be Inevitable and DDfortuoate problems with McElroy's 
order, as it places responslbWty for enforcement with the faculty. It can 
hanDy he expected that aU faculty who smote will easUy enforee a 
smoking ban. 

In sucb cases non-smoting students wlU have to bring pressure on the 
faculty to enforce the nate. And, II this prellSure faDs, oilicial mechanism 
must be establlsbed 110 administrative pressure can be brought to bear on 
lax faculty. Administrative pressnre Is bound to be more effective than a 
smattering of Intense, but diffll8e-student action. 

StlD, McElroy's order Is a good step. In fact, It should be expanded to 
Include aU university employees who have dealings with the pubUc. A 
person's rlgbt to smoke must be secondary to another person's rlgbt to 
clean and bealthy air. 

Out to Lunch -II 

In your article "Bike Coop 
Draws Fire from Shops" (Triton 
Times, Jan. 12, 1977) there were a 
number of points which may not 
accurately reflect our involvement 
and our position in regards to the 
operation of the Bike Coop on the 
UCSD Campus. 

Our first contact with University 
officials was on Nov. 3, 1976. At 
that time we met with Tom Brown, 
Assistant Vice-chancellor of 
Student Affairs, and Larry 
Rairden, Bike Coop Represen-
tative. The purpose ofthat meeting 
was to ascertain the method of 
operation of the Bike Coop . . There 
were no accusations or arguments 
made at that meeting. We leU the 
meeting with the understanding 
that the Bike Coop is essentially 
operated as a student activitv. 

The next COrttact I had from 
anyone at the University was a 
phone call from Joel Don, 
Associate News Editor on the 
Triton Times staff. Mr. Don asked 
questions regarding our position on 
the operation of the Bike Coop. 

The following statement in the 
article does not reflect our 

. position; "La Jolla owners want it 

closed." - I was asked if discon-
tinuing the practice of selling to the 
general public would satisfy me. 
My answer was "No." Period. Our 
finn believes that the Bike Coop 
would have to revise its mode of 
operation in other respects as well 
to be acceptable to the private 
business s;ommunity. 

It is apparent that other dealers' 
opinions were solicited for the 
arlicle. However, since only my 
name is used, it would be possible 
for a reader to assume that I made 
all the statements .. It would have 
been helpful to identify the source 
of each comment. 

We also take issue with the 
generalization by Tom Brown that 
bike shop owners "have built a 
whole line of arguments on total 
lies." Our firm has adopted a 
position based on the facts which 
were obtained in our meeting with 
Tom Brown. We do not want our 
position confused with those of 
other bike dealers. We are not 
formally associated with any 
organization or group of bicycle 
dealers that are involved in the 
Bike Coop controversy. 

We believe that the follOwing 
factors should be considered: 

1) The Bike Coop does not pay 
real or personal property tax on 
the land or inventory which they 
use to conduct business. The Bike 
Coop therefore operates at an 
advantage in that respect, as 
compared to ' a private 
businessman. 

2) There are other ad-
ministrative and organizational 

be~fits which the Bike Coop 
utilizes that are not taken into 
consideration when calculating 
operating expenses. . 

3) Should the Bike Coop, with it's 
justification for existence being 
questioned, continue to sell to the 
general public? 

4) Underlying the controversy 
surrounding the Bike Coop is the 
question of exactly what should 
University policy be regarding the 
establishment of retail outlets on 
CampllS .. Should the University 
provide necessities (food, books 
and lodging) or should the

Benson: Jazz Guitarist Makes Good 
by Ted Navin Burke . 

Staff Writer 
In F1ight-Ceorge Benson (Warner 
Brothers) 

Up until the release of his 
Breezln ' album, George Benson 
has been primarily a jazz guitarist 
of the very tasty variety, resting 

some where between the styles of 
Wes Montgomery and Joe Pass. 
Though there are guitarists more 
technicaUy awesome than Benson 
(Herb Ellis, Pass, Jim Hall, and 
Kenny Burrell come to mind) few 
of them have perfected his 
graceful touch and satin smooth

In FUgitt, his latest.release, isn't 
by any means horrible. Benson's 
guitar work, when he allows 
himself the room for a solo is as 
good as its ever been, and in a 
couple of cases borders on outright 

br~lliance. "Nature Boy," "The 
Wllld And I," and most of the 
others, are predicated on simple 
danceable rhythms and a rock 
hard backbeat (ably han!Ded by 
Phil Upchurch, Stanley Banks and 
Harvey' Mason,) over which 
Benson decorates things with 
dancing riffs, tastefully broken up 
runs and octave soloing imbued 
with a golden tone. The stand out 
performance here is Benson's 
rendition of War 's "The World Is a 
Ghetto," lithely rwming through

Sixtie's Flashback From a Black Perspective 
By Ted Navin Burke 

Sta If Writer 

Many who took the pretensions of the Sixties as articles of faith (with 
communes, dope and other drug related brain nullifiers, long hair, rock 
music , anti-war demonstrations, and the other things being equated with 
legitimate political conciousness) have emerged into the Seventies 
suffering cultural shell shock. 

Ed Bullin's The Taking 01 Miss Janie is an attempt to present the black 
experience of the Sixties, focusing specifically on the relationships be-
tween blacks whose minds were on integration and upward mobility, and 
white liberals who would consort with blacks while maintaining a 
distance from them that belied a latent racism. 

The play opens in the apartment of Monty, a good looking black man. 
He is lying on a mattress with a white woman, Janie , who is crying and is 
pondering about why Monty raped her. She had always considered Monty 
her " special friend" over the years, and now was disheveled in her 
conceptions of their relationship after he " took" her. As the stage lights 
dim, there is a flash back to when the two just met. They meet at a bus 
stop after school. She initiates'3 conversation because they share a 
creative writing class, and praises some poetry he had written and read 
aloud. Monty, eyeing her lecherously, invites her to a party. She accepts, 
eKpecting him to read more of his poetry. 

As the scene changes to the party, we are in Monty's apartment and are 
confronted by his roommates. Rick, a black nationalist devotee with a 
pronounced dislike for " white devils," is laying a heavy polemiC on Len, a 
black intellectual who has attended a junior college for five years. Monty 
and Len encourage Rick to "not be a drag" at the party with his rhetoric 
because the get was to be mixed.

Mi$ Janie ... 

[C-alDued from pqe5] 
uses slloquies in which the 
characters supply the underlining 
dynamics of the party's in-
teractions. Janie has romantic 
motions about Monty, wanting to 
keep in an non-sexual, rarified 
context where she can indulge her 
desire to experience the vissitudes 
of Victorian, romantic love. She 
confesses at one point that she's 
made love before with blacks and 
will probably do it again, but 'not 
with Monty, because he represents 
the undefined "specialness" she 
wants. 

Monty, on the other hand, is 
obsessed with white women, and is 
determined to sexually " take" -
Janie, no matter how, and no 
matter how long it takes. Through 
other speeches by the black women 
in the play, it's revealed that 
Monty is a sexual opportWlist, 
chasing women of either color just 
so long as he can keep defining his 
masculinity by how many women 

Your family and friends will enjoy 
staying at La Jolla's newest 
high-rise resort .hotel.

A!J the play pIIOgresses through 

it's fragmented way, the themes 
come' to the surface. At one point, 
Rick and Peggy, Monty's ex-wife, 
are having a dialogue where the 
temporal sense of the scene lapses 
into limbo. They begin to talk about 
the Sixties in the past tense, with 
Peggy saying that everyone in the 
Party was the youth of the sixties, 
reflective of the potent political 
power of the times. "We blew it" 
she declares finally. 

Everyone, black and white, must 
settle for the daily politics of 
getting by. 

Monty, in a reprise to the play's 
opening, tears off Janie's clothes 
and rapes her. The need for put on 
platonicism had evaporated, and 
Monty was left with nothing to do 
but enact what was always on his 
mind, or be left feeling like a 
powerless fool. Janie in turn is 
brought back down to earth, her 
preconcieved notions shattered in 
the worse way she could imagine. 

The Drama Dept. production, 
directed by Luther James, 
featured strong performCUlces by 
the cast. Especially noteworthy 
were John W. Houston as Rick the 
black nationalist, supplying a 
pensive, fanatical intensity that 
approached buffoonery.- Marcia 
Robinson as Peggy was moving, 
handling the hardluck stories with 
a detached remorse, avoiding soap 
opera melodramatics. .

In totem, the production was 
first rate, giving more strength to a 
play that's strong on ideas but 
weak on realization. Bullins 
resorts too often to cliches and 
reveals a strong propensity for 
converting his characters into 
political types. There are instances 
when the speeches seem to stem 
more from trendy politics than 
from personalities. 

Benson ... 
[ConUnued from pagef] 

the melody in the beginning with 
brief. solo statements, then 
merging into best vocal outing on 
the album. Benson's voice is warm 
and subtle, and is shown to best 
advantage when he scat sings in 
synch with his guitar work 
emulating the fast succession of 
riffs with phenomenal precision. 

In FHgbt's faults, over all, lie in 
the material, which is second hand 
compared to those on his CTI 
releases (Body Talk and Bad 
Benson, ) relying on a rhythm 
section that though competent, 
gets hypnotically monotonous over 
long exposure. One gets the feeling 
that they're descending into a disco 
hell. Claus Ogerman's orchestral 
arrangements get in the way as 
well, adding a sickening sweet 
texture behind a musician who 
deserVes a better, less patronizing 
context. 

Benson, however, has landed a 
gig that makes him big money, and 
considering how long he'$ been 
plugging away at playing (about 
twenty two years), he deserves the 
bread. One hopes the audience will 
eventually appreciate Benson's 
best virtues as they do this well 
crafted shlock.
