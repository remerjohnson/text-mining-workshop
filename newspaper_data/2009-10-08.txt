Budget cuts and the lack of a per-
manent composting facility on cam-
pus have prevented dining hall food 
waste from being composted, but 
campus groups continue to pursue a 
more sustainable campus.

According to Housing and Dining 
Sustainability Manager Krista Mays, 
the HDH dining locations produce 
four tons of compost daily, none of 
which is being composted because no 
site on campus that can handle such a 
large volume of waste.

The university is currently com-
municating with the City of San 
Diego's food scrap program at 
Miramar Landfill, a private site off-
campus.

"Miramar Landfill has received 
approval to expand its composting 
program," Campus Sustainability 
Coordinator Maggie Souder said. 
"UC San Diego would like to be 
included as a customer in Miramar’s 
composting program."

However, approval to take part in 
the program is highly competitive. 

"Everyone has the same issue," 
Souder said. "Everyone wants to 
minimize landfill waste and everyone 
wants to do it at Miramar." 

For now, the composting bins at 
dining halls serve only to encourage 
students to separate their compost 

Campus Speech 
Policy Debuts 
for Public Input
Xue Mao 
Contributing Writer

Two years after uproar from student and civil-rights orga-
nizations forced university officials to withdraw a proposal 
for a more restrictive UCSD speech policy — released quietly 
during finals week in Spring Quarter 2007 — administrators 
proposed a new, milder version of the current 1981-drafted 
policy over campuswide e-mail on Oct. 1. In the e-mail, 
Vice chancellors Penny Rue and Steven Relyea attached the 
revised policy and requested feedback by Dec. 1.

Two of three student representatives who served on the 
committee, undergraduates James Baldwin 
and Erin Brodwin, announced the draft’s 
release at the A.S. Council meeting last 
night. 

When a councilmember asked if Baldwin 
and Brodwin were happy with the new pol-
icy, both expressed that some concessions 

had been made in compromising with the 10 to 15 university 
officials on the committee.

“It was the best we could do in the committee; there were 
serious negotiations made,” Baldwin said.

Due to expansion of the campus, the policy features an 
updated list of areas in which the use of electronically ampli-
fied sound is permitted, within the hours of 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 
p.m. — reduced from a former slot of 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 
additionally including all areas within 150 feet of university 
buildings, but lifting all restrictions on the Student Center

As dramatic state budget cuts con-tinue to stir unrest within the University of California, candidates 
for the 2010 gubernatorial election have 
begun to take their positions on the touchy 
topic of funding higher education. 

Though it is still very early in the elec-

tion — primaries aren’t until June, and the 
election itself will be held in November 2010 
— those vying for the office are already pub-
licizing their positions on hot-button issues, 
including what to do about the state’s ailing 
public universities.

Early candidate and San Francisco mayor 
Gavin Newsom addressed the UC walkouts 
directly, encouraging California legislators 
to strengthen the Cal Grant system and roll 
back fee increases. 

“We’re just now starting to see the unrest 
that accompanies such drastic cuts,” he said 
in a statement released Oct. 1.  

Newsom said he favors full funding for 

the UC system, though he conceded that 
extensive budget reform is necessary before 
this can happen. His position appeals to 
public fears that the university is becoming 
more privatized.

UCSD College Democrats President 
Victor Lin said he is afraid higher fees are 
making for a decrease in accessibility to the 
university. Lin worked for Newsom’s cam-
paign this summer. 

“He’s basically a champion for us stu-
dents,” Lin said. “Newsom is the only guy 
out there in the entire field of Democrats 

Some contenders address 
UC funding crisis;
others avoid the issue.

Hump, Price Center Plaza and Library. 
Chalking is also newly authorized, 
though restricted to surfaces exposed 
to weather elements.

Committee member and Director 
of Student Policies and Judicial Affairs 
Tony Valladolid said the committee 
hopes to review public commentary 
and put the new policy into effect by 
the beginning of Winter Quarter. 

UCSD’s current policy states that 
free speech can only be practiced 
in areas “at least 25 feet from the 
entrances/exits of campus buildings 
and parking lots.” In contrast, the new 
draft allows un-electronically ampli-
fied expression anywhere on campus 
— given there is no “unreasonable” 
interference with university business, 
other persons or the environment. 

According to Assistant Vice 
Chancellor of Student Life Gary 
Ratcliffe, who also served on the 
committee, administrative officials in 
charge of each amplified sound zone 
will have ultimate jurisdiction over 
expressive activity within that zone, 
regardless of the policy. 

However, Ratcliffe expressed that 
general enforcement of speech on 
campus will be much simpler than 

in the past, with new “objective stan-
dards,” such as a volume limit of 90 
decibels, that will eliminate the pos-
sibility of content-based bias.

The university’s spring 2007 pro-
posal for a new “draconian” policy 
— according to Benjamin Balthaser, 
the graduate student representative on 
the committee — would have given 
the university exclusive control over 
speech on campus. In response, in Fall 
Quarter 2008, Balthaser and a group 
of fellow student activists drafted their 
ideal version of the policy.

Though university officials on the 
committee have said the new policy 
still retains much of the students’ origi-
nal version, Balthasar disagrees.

“The student policy is very simple: 
an open campus,” he said.

Nonetheless, Balthaser stressed that 
the student-administrator collabora-
tive draft is an improvement from the 
2007 proposal.

“Students should recognize that we 
won an important victory,” he said.

The final draft — titled the Policy 
on Speech, Advocacy and Distribution 
of Literature on University Grounds 
— will apply exclusively to students, 
faculty and staff at UCSD. The speech 
policy regulating nonaffiliates is over-

seen by the UC Board of Regents and 
applies to all UC campuses.

Sally Brainerd, chair of the com-
mittee that drafted the policy, could 
not be reached for comment. She will 
be fielding all public commentary until 
Dec. 1, which can be sent to PPM510@
ucsd.edu.

Balthaser expressed that students 
should be more concerned with the 
nonaffiliate speech policy, which states 
that those not affiliated with the uni-
versity may not practice public expres-
sion on campuses without the consent 
of the regents.

Currently, a separate committee, 
also composed of UCSD students and 
administrators, is tasked with the duty 
of adapting the regents’ policy to the 
San Diego campus. Student represen-
tative John Condello said he is frustrat-
ed with the progress of the committee.

“If I were to make changes to the 
document, I would throw the whole 
rotten piece of legislation in the trash 
and simply apply the affiliate free 
speech policy (which turned out pretty 
decently) to nonaffiliates,” Condello 
said in an e-mail.

and Republicans, who is actually try-
ing to protect us students from fur-
ther tuition increases.”

While the other gubernatorial can-
didates have not explicitly 
discussed the systemwide 
UC walkout that took place 
on Sept. 24, several have 
taken a stance on the prior-
ity of funding higher edu-
cation.

Republican candidate 
Meg Whitman, who is the 
former CEO of eBay, said 
that in today’s economy, 
the state should “put jobs 
first.”

Though Whitman said 
she would like to "restore 
much of the spending in 
higher education,” she 
added that universities must take a 
backseat to reviving California's job 
market. 

Warren College junior John Don, 
a member of College Republicans at 

UCSD, said Whitman recognizes the 
importance of the UC system to the 
job market. 

“She’s even singled out UCSD as 
part of the economic engine of the 

state,” Don said. 
Revelle College junior 

Alec Weisman, editor of 
conservative on-campus 
newspaper the California 
Review, agrees.

“Whitman would go 
with what would work on 
a statewide level and would 
actually get things done, 
based on how a business 
would do it,” Weisman said. 

Republican candidate 
Steve Poizner, who made 
a name for himself as a 
Silicon Valley entrepre-
neur, said the state should 

provide “necessary resources” for uni-
versities to produce more engineering 
and business students. 

He has not yet presented any possi-
ble solutions for saving the UC system.

Former House of Representatives 
Rep. Tom Campbell hopes to raise 
revenue for the university by allowing 
UC researchers to retain the patents 
for their discoveries rather than forc-
ing them to turn the patents over to 
the state. 

He hopes his plan will draw new 
faculty members, despite the recent 
pay cuts and furloughs that have driv-
en away valuable UC professors. 

Jerry Brown, former governor of 
California and prospective Democratic 
candidate, has released no public state-
ment conveying his views on edu-
cation. (Brown has not yet officially 
declares his candidacy, despite having 
filed paperwork a week ago.)

Brown drew heavy criticism in 
1992 when he suggested that teach-
ers should calculate “psychic income” 
— or, the satisfaction and intrinsic 
rewards they got from teaching — into 
their overall salary.

The A.S. Council's central issue of the night — which sparked nearly a two-hour debate 
— surrounded the legalities of A.S. 
Mandate Reserves and the proper 
usage of the council's backup funds. 

Earlier, during public input, 
Campuswide Senator Adam 
Kenworthy offered a cheaper alterna-
tive to the proposed A.S. sponsored 
“No Koala” campaign. Armed with 
a stack of fliers which Kenworthy 
said cost about 
$3.40 to make, 
compared to the 
$1500 budget 
President Utsav 
Gupta proposed 
to set aside for 
the cause. 

Next, Associate Vice President of 
Local Affairs Aries Yumul brought 
up a sensitive issue regarding the 
California Valley Miwok Tribe. As 
he held his cell phone to the micro-
phone, Tribal Chair Silvia Burley 
told the council how her tribe was 
evicted from their land by a county 
sheriff 's department. 

“We’re fighting to stand up for 
our sovereign rights and to kick the 
non-Indians out of our business,”  an 
emotional Burley said. 

AVP Enterprise Operations Rishi 
Ghosh gave a special presentation 
about the Sustainability Center. 
Councilmembers received free pins 
and recycled notebooks with the 
center’s newly designed logo. The 
center, which will open in Price 
Center West on Nov. 20, will provide 
programming focused on a differ-
ent sustainability-related cause each 
month.

In a presentation by the council's 
external affairs office, VP External 
Affairs Gracelynne West and UCSA 
field organizer Jeanalee Obergfell 
discussed the office's mission to build 

campuswide student involvement in 
acheiving accessibility, affordability 
and quality higher education. 

During oral reports, VP Student 
Life Riscie Hernandez announced 
that Fall Fest tickets sales were low. 
Her advice for raising sales in a mere 
two days? 

“Promote it to your constituents,” 
she said. 

As the motions from the finance 
committee were slowly approved, the 

council halted at 
the specific word-
ing of a motion 
to fund a $10,000 
allocation to Phi 
Gamma Delta. 

The council 
passed amend-

ments to take $10,000 from A.S. 
Mandate Reserves, but many felt 
strongly against using the stored 
funds for a cause not explicitly 
stated by the organization filing the 
request. 

After much debate and a 10-min-
ute recess, the council reconvened. 

“Ideologically [the money] was 
taken from other student orgs, but 
fiscally, it’s right,” Campuswide 
Senator Alex Vu said.

The council settled to pass the 
underwrite and take $10,000 out of 
Mandate Reserves.  

Campuswide Senator Bryant Pena 
asked councilmembers during Open 
Forum to sign a petition that sup-
porting making the new Chicano art 
mural on Peterson Hall permanent.  

Gupta ended the relatively short 
meeting with a statement that gener-
ated gasps of excitement from coun-
cilmembers. 

“I’m working to get ‘B’ permits for 
college chairs and A.S. senators,” he 
said. “I’m going to submit a proposal 
soon, so if you'd like to put your 
name on this list, email me.”

into the appropriate receptacles.
"We are working with our dining 

guests to sort their waste into the cor-
rect bins, so that when we can take 
the composting to the city’s program 
the material is clean and ready to go," 
Mays said. "We anticipate being able 
to actually divert the compostables to 
the city’s compost facility by the end 
of 2009."  

HDH has also encountered bud-
geting obstacles. Last year, HDH 
planned to hire analysts to study the 
university's food waste and suggest 
ways to decrease it; however, the plan 
was never implemented due to lack 
of funds. 

In addition, UCSD's waste diver-

sion specialist resigned and the 
position will not be filled. Instead, 
Sustainability Analyst Kristen 
Hansen will take on the position's 
responsibilities, which include help-
ing the campus increase diversion 
waste, promoting recycling programs 
and increasing access to local com-
posting.  

Souder said that UCSD is plan-
ning to write composting agreements 
into its contracts with waste haulers 
that provide composting services on 
their sites. 

The Compost Team, a student 
organization dedicated to compost-
ing and sustainability, composted 
100 pounds of waste last year. The 
group originally intended to com-

post all waste on campus, but the 
enormity of the task proved unfea-
sible. 

According to founder Michelle 
Kizner, the group is now focused on 
raising awareness and encouraging 
people to bring their compost mate-
rial from home to the team's small 
compost site located near the Hopkins 
Parking Structure.  

"We are looking to begin compost-
ing with student entities like the Food 
Co-op and the Grove, and will also 
use the site as a drop-off location for 
interested people to bring their com-
postables,” Kizner said.

In study-abroad semesters of yore, our obligatory romance-language love affairs could be 
peacefully left behind once USS 
EAP pulled from the foreign shore. 
After a single tear-stained wave 
goodbye, those carefree months of 
tumbling through daisy fields and 
licking spaghetti sauce off each oth-
er’s noses could blip into no more 
than a fond coming-of-age memory 
— or damn good fireside fodder for 
the grandchildren.

Then came Skype. Disguised as 
a nifty gadget to be enjoyed at one’s 
casual convenience, equipped with 
video chat and a next-to-free inter-
national telephone, this Big Brother 
of a desktop shortcut negates every 
possible excuse you could ever have 
for losing touch with someone. 
Making it — in all its friendly bub-
ble noises and happy green buttons 
— the terrifying second coming of 
the great ball and chain.

Don’t say I didn’t warn you. 
Because, as everyone who has ever 
been in a Skypelationship knows, 
the temptation to revisit one’s exotic 
fling will be far too great to over-
come. Call me weak, but Latin sex 
— even of the penetration-less vari-
ety, unsexily transmitted over invis-
ible ozone cables — is better than 
anything I’m going to scrounge up 
at this sterile laboratory of a univer-
sity. (Not that lab sex can’t be hot; 
just that, as they say, it’s the motion 
in the ocean.)

If you do find yourself ever 
returning to that pixilated apple 
of your eye — sentiments swathed 
in nostalgia butter (barf), rose-
colored by the distance — chances 
are you’re riding on the memory of 
some pretty hot sex. Accordingly, 
you’ll likely only tolerate a couple 
nights of “I Spy” and kissy-faceoffs 
before the itch will be triggered by 
a phallic lamppost in the immedi-
ate background, and somebody will 
most certainly ask to see somebody 
else’s boobs.

Which brings us to Skype sex, 
first base: the striptease. Take this 
opportunity to let free the freaky 
foreplayer you were always too 
horny to be. Put those Frederick’s 
of Hollywood impulse buys and 
junior-high sleepover workouts 
to “Carmen Electra’s Aerobic 
Striptease” to good use, drawing out 
the show as long as possible. Really, 
what’s the rush? Especially consid-
ering the great anticlimactic (hehe) 
Skype clincher: No one’s getting laid 
tonight.

(In case you buried yourself 
in the schoolyard gravel pit first 
through sixth grade, your very own 
stripper moniker can be generated 
by combining the name of your first 
pet with the name of the first street 
you lived on. Groovy.)

Once cloth-stuffs are strewn 
sidescreen, nonchalantly adjust the 
lighting to accommodate the lumpy 
aftermath of international In-N-Out 
withdrawal. Love handles may be 
endearingly grabbable in the dark 
backseat of a Cuban Caddy, but 
long-distance eroticism is based on 
visuals. Absence never made the

Last Saturday, the Guardian editorial board joined other UC newspaper staffs at a face-
to-face meeting with President Mark 
Yudof to discuss the university’s dire 
financial crisis.

Our hour-long meeting clarified a 
number of things that convoluted fact 
sheets and walkout hearsay could not.

Firstly, Yudof admitted he saw no 
end in sight for inflated student fees, 
just an eventual drop in their rate of 
increase. He also explained, however, 
why the cost of a UC education, 
though constantly rising, is a bargain. 
And it’s sadly (sort of) true. 

Yudof has proposed a 32-percent 
student fee increase, but plans to 
direct 33 percent of the increase’s rev-
enue to financial aid. Under his plan, 
students whose parents make below 
$60,000 per year will pay the least 
in student fees (nothing), and those 
whose parents make above $180,000 
per year will pay the most (about 
$9,640) for the 2009-10 academic 
year. Currently, the University of 
Michigan charges $11, 848 in student 
fees per year — and they’re not nearly 
as broke as we are. Granted, cost of 
living is higher in California, but the 
cost of paradise isn’t up to university 
officials.

Depending on a student’s family 
income, he might be better off than 
— or, at worst, just as screwed as — 
most of the nation’s students.

That’s not to say a prohibitively 
expensive public education isn’t a 
travesty that should be addressed 
as swiftly as possible. But rela-
tively speaking, we Californians have 
enjoyed low costs and top quality for 
so long that we’re a teeny bit spoiled. 

The fact of the matter is: During 

economic hardships like these, barely 
any state in our nation can provide 
an entirely affordable education to its 
students. Though a national perspec-
tive on the UC’s financial situation 
may not be entirely helpful, it’s some-
thing we must consider when we 
mouth off about the good old days.

Yudof also emphasized that he 
must continue paying competitive 
market-level salaries because a large 
chunk of top-paid employees are phy-
sicians. Though we argued to drasti-
cally cut top executive pay in an Oct. 
1 editorial entitled “We’re Broke, But 
the Kingdom’s Gates Are Golden,” we 
would not recommend doing so for 
the university’s doctors. If there is any 
position that should continue to offer 
competitive salaries in order to retain 
talented individuals, it is that in which 

we entrust thousands of patients’ lives. 
However, the regents should still 

consider cutting the pay of adminis-
trative positions like Yudof ’s — if not 
to compensate for the crappy hand 
California’s dealt us, then as a gesture 
to unite the university and make 
workers and students feel like every-
one’s holding unlucky cards together. 

Yudof, however, disagrees on this 
particular issue. After two salary cuts, 
he is “making do” with a below-mar-
ket salary in the triple digits.

So instead, we ask that Yudof 
extend his lines of communication to 
the masses. YouTube videos and brief 
conference-room meetings will not 
inspire cooperation among the work-
ers and students who are up in arms.

We need a man at the center of 
campus on a podium — not an online 

chart — to hash out the grim facts, 
answer questions and clarify miscon-
ceptions. Why not hold online chat 
forums and offer financial-aid offices 
as resource centers for budgetary 
information? If we learned so much in 
a single hour-long conversation, imag-
ine what Yudof could do for those 
infuriated students who demanded his 
removal during the Sept. 24 walkout. 

If we’re in this together, we can-
not see our president as a man who 
refuses to personally address those 
affected by his choices up top.  Covert 
meetings in buildings guarded by 
cops will not inspire us to jump on 
Yudof ’s ship; an empathetic leader 
who stands before his audience and 
asks them to voice their concerns will 
gain the respect needed to cope with 
a colossal crisis like ours.

A dreary day is upon us: Now that Sierra Summit is in a pre-renovation coma and El 
Mercado has served its final order of 
Carne Asada fries (R.I.P.), eating on 
campus just got a lot less convenient. 

Though Associate Director of 
Housing, Dining and Hospitality Steve 
Casad keeps assuring us that the Muir 
College overflow problem has proven 
painless, numbers speak for them-
selves: last Thursday, 583 of Muir’s 
1062 residents swiped at OceanView 
Terrace, 474 hit up Goody’s Place 
and Market, 271 ate at Plaza Cafe and 
another 151 went to Cafe Ventanas.

Of course, freshmen have no point 
of reference to happier, more bounti-
ful days of yesteryear. As Week Two 
is just coming to a close, they haven’t 
snapped out of the novel daze that 
comes with unlimited burritos from 9 
to 1 a.m. They also aren’t busy enough 
yet to realize that once they’ve got 150 
pages of the Canterbury Tales to whiz 
through, those half-hour mediocre-
burrito lines won’t seem so worth it. 

While Casad attributes the cafete-
rias’ new state of constant mosh-pit to 

the usual beginning-of-
the-year rush and hir-
ing of new, untrained 
workers, the number of 
meal-carded residents 
won’t be dropping to 
convenient lows any-
time before June. We 
may not have reached 
our threshold for soggy 

fries yet this quarter, but the situation 
won’t improve until the displaced 
Muir diners have a place all their own.

Muir residents currently pay the 
same as their peers across campus for 
a meal plan, but without the benefit 
of in-college dining — which may 
indeed seem a petty gripe in light of 

all the other challenges the University 
of California faces. Yet on a campus of 
this size, students have more to worry 
about than passing through never-
ending stir-fry lines with relative 
speed — the issue of travel time, too, 
comes into play. Negligible as it may 
seem, those extra 15 or 20 minutes 
it takes to trudge to OVT and back 
make that dusty cup of ramen under 
the bed a whole lot more enticing. 

We have, of course, been spoiled 
with choices in the past. Though the 
lamentable loss of the OVT quesadilla 
isn’t quite cause for rebellion, the 
new offerings at Goody’s — a bur-
rito bar, cafe and limited selection 
of premade sandwiches and pasta 
salads — leave few healthy options. 
Not only is it imperative that we be 
able to eat quickly; Housing, Dining 
and Hospitality must also ensure that 
those students unwilling to stomach 

their 100th greasy concoction have 
access to greener choices than cur-
rently exist. 

Also impermissible is the fact that 
construction on Sierra Summit is 
not expected to begin until January. 
In the meantime, the space remains 
untouched by both demolition crews 
and swarms of starved students. While 
that poor choice can’t be reversed, 
Housing, Dining and Hospitality 
should consider extending the hours 
of our existing dining halls to reduce 
the nightly pre-closing rush — if only 
to pay respect to those Muir students 
who pass by a caution-taped Summit 
on their long trudge to Goody’s. 

Especially unacceptable is that 
OVT’s closing hour has been scaled 
back from 1 a.m. to 9 p.m. While 
renovating a decades-old facility is 
beneficial to students, cutting access 
to existing dining locations is not. 

After all, it’s Housing, Dining and 
Hospitality’s job to ensure fast service 
and healthy choices — not ours.

ON THE LINE By Christina Aushana

Dear Editor,
As a student director for the 

Student Sustainability Collective 
at the new Sustainability Resource 
Center, I would like to inform the 
student body of the exciting new 
opportunities ahead of us as the 
SRC opens later this quarter.

As a result of the successful 
student activity fee referendum 
last Winter Quarter, we now have 
resources and funding to allow stu-
dents to take an active role in mak-
ing campus more sustainable.

The SSC helps empower students 
in two ways: by 1) uniting existing 
sustainability efforts on campus 
in order to foster community, net-
working and collaboration, and 2) 
providing the space and resources 
necessary to accelerate the growth of 
new efforts. 

The SRC will become the one-
stop location for students interested 

in social and environmental justice.
We are having our Sustainability 

Kick-Off on Friday, Oct. 9, from 
5 p.m. to 7 p.m. in the Student 
Services Complex Multipurpose 
Room, and this is an open invitation 
to everyone on campus to attend 
and take advantage of the resources 
in front of them.

Our Web site also has opportuni-
ties at www.sscucsd.com.

heart grow fonder under wormy 
fluorescents. 

That’s not to say you should 
turn the lights down too low, either 
— laptop glow hugs double chins 
(among more intimate bulges) like 
a shot-elastic cat suit. If you notice, 
via self-cam thumbnail, that you’re 
starting to take on a scary-story 
flashlight look, dink your screen’s 
brightness down a couple notches 
— unless, of course, you’re shooting 
for all-American Paris Hilton.

What’s the best angle to achieve 
godliness, you ask? In bed, with 
your computer peering up at you, 
almost no position you can attempt 

is flattering. Apple may have 
slam-dunked business-conference 
convenience with its embedded 
laptop webcam, but sex-simulating 
perspectives are obsolete (unless 
you’re down to sort of sit on your 
keyboard; sorry, TMI) and motion 
never quite transcends the erotic 
appeal of a robot-gator flapping its 
jaw. Which could be groovy as well, 
I guess.

It will probably be a rare 
moment in which all your house-
mates have vacated the premises, 
allowing you to take part in this 
sick form of quasi-masturbation 
(though it is a step up from instant-
messenger sex) in peace. So, in 

order to keep your pathetic excuse 
for a relationship alive and healthy, 
you may have to get creative seated 
inconspicuously among the unsus-
pecting studious in Geisel. Take the 
director’s chair for a heavily nar-
rated under-table adventure.

No one’s trying to pretend an 
awkward Skype-gasm can replace 
the real thing. In fact, it usually just 
leaves you craving human contact 
(of the sweaty, naked variety) more 
than ever before. But hey — at least 
you won’t be popping out a little 
multicultural family anytime soon.

FILMREVIEW

By Gretchen Wegrich
Contributing Writer

T he Coen brothers made their mark on Hollywood by pushing motony’s stylistic limit — exploring morose themes with even 
darker humor. Despite a shoddy screenplay, “A 
Serious Man” is no exception, though this 1960s 
period piece feels more like an introspective time 

capsule peering into the directors’ own Jewish 
childhoods than a product of their outrageous 
imaginations. 

It’s 1967, and Larry Gopnick (Michael 
Stuhlbarg) is trapped in a Minnesota suburban 
dystopia — not unlike the Coens, pre-Oscars. 
Gopnick’s wife (Sari Lennick) wants to divorce him 
for the pompous Sy Abelman (Fred Melamed); his 
promotion at the university is being hampered by 
an anonymous letter writer; his worst student is 
trying to bribe his way to a passing grade; his son 
is getting high at Hebrew school; his blue-collar 
neighbor doesn’t understand property lines; and, 
worst of all, the rabbi won’t so much as see him. 

Like sinister puppeteers, the Coens weave 
slow pacing with deadpan humor to evoke the 
eerie suffocation of suburban perfection, as 
Larry — the embodiment of male mediocrity — 
struggles to understand why bad things happen 
to good people. 

It is within these moments of utter disil-
lusionment, as all Larry’s well-intentioned yet 
distinctively clueless acquaintances offer him 
pointless anecdotes and monotone advice, that 
the comedic gold of the film shines through.

After all, when life goes up in flames, what is 
there left to do but laugh?

While stony dialogue is forced at times, the 
majority of the cast manages to be believable in 
spite of their boxy screenplay. Only in Larry’s son 
Danny (Aaron Wolff) do we see a departure from 

the film’s self-conscious, 
period-piece feel, when 
the young man shows up 
to his own bar mitzvah so 
thoroughly blazed that he 
barely manages to sound 
out the Torah.

Though it was prob-
ably the Coens’ intention, 
Larry’s suburban universe 
feels staged to the point 
of overkill, much like the 
popular advertisements 
of the decade that invade 
every scene — minus 
shiny happiness. In their 
efforts to break down the 
decade into meticulous 
detail, the directors leave 
the audience wondering, 
along with our unlikely 
hero, whether any of it was 
real — or worth it.

Maybe it’s the generation gap, but too many 
punch lines and pop-culture references get lost in 
translation, undoubtedly flying over the heads of 
anyone not approaching senior citizenship. But 
if you can sit through back-to-back slow pans of 
listless ‘60s suburbia, the Coens’ characteristic 
disregard for a traditional Hollywood ending is 
worth the wait.

how even less cool than that armpit 
hickey you gave yourself last year. He 
indisputably plucks his unibrow.

But you won’t see the Game 
hiding out in his nerd box 
anytime soon.

In 2004, over two 
independently pushed 
albums — both god-
awful, not that he cared 
— Taylor talked himself 
into a big enough blimp 
to set off the dollar-sign 
radars of top-game G-Unit 
thugs and scrambling Interscope 
cronies alike. By the time 2005’s 
star-streaked Documentary dropped, 
smack-dab in the middle of the West 
Coast hip-hop revival, the Game had 
gathered an almost unprecedented 
fire trail of support on the beat — 
Hi-Tek, Storch, Timbaland, Blaze, 
Kanye and Dre himself all saw some-
thing big busting from that painfully 
scratchy, unremarkable throat.

Even the ogreish 50 sounded a 
smidge more endearing next to the 
Game’s revving engines — if only 
because the latter out-ogred him. The 
Cool and Dre-produced “Hate It or 
Love It” was bone-chilling; whether 
or not 50 and Game knew how 
ridiculous they were, low-riding on 
a wavy live-jazz loop like they could 

turn cobblestones platinum, a shared 
noble air of stony self-importance 
was enough to make us forget the 
former’s  tear tattoo and latter’s medi-
cally unsound ape stance.

Which is why it’s so sad, really, 

that Game has sparked over 20 beefs 
since then, from pay-attention-to-me 
darts at Dre to unthought monkey 
shit like “Banks is a bitch, 50 is a 
bitch, Buck is a bitch, Yayo is a bitch, 
Olivia’s a bitch — no, Olivia’s a man.”

In this way, the Game schemed 
his own demise: Doctor’s Advocate 
and LAX didn’t even outsell his debut 
combined. But there always seems 
to be a genius on his side. With Lil 
Wayne’s help, Game made last year’s 

“My Life” the ghetto tearjerker of 
the new millennium, and may have 
learned to rap in the process.

He’s headed this way, and hip-
hop’s biggest loner is about to teach 
RIMAC to swag.

crowd dressed in tight t-shirts (extra 
points for irony). And, judging from the 
first explosion of electric guitar with a 
drum beat like it had just run a marathon, 
you’d be right. 

The Florida-raised fivepiece doesn’t 
look like much, but where Anberlin stands 
out from their blurry, bleak counterparts is 
in a 20/20 clarity on layering: Every chord 
and beat remains distinct in a world that 
tends to rub its fingers raw with each stut-
ter of the strings. Above all soars Stephen 
Christian’s voice, a naive tenor barely 

deigned to morph into the puke-scream 
favored by Anberlin’s brother-bands (Fall 
Out Boy, I’m lookin’ at you). His rich man-
shower vocals shift Anberlin out of pimply 
territory, rendering something more like 
emo’s chill older brother who’s also a born-
again Christian. It’s the voice that roars 
the bitterest parts of “Paper Thin Hymn,” 
murmurs softly in “The Unwinding Cable 
Car” and hiccups with utmost precision in 
“Blame Me! Blame Me!” Basically, it’s stuff 
both you and your girlfriend can sing to. 
It’s the band you introduce to your parents 
when they ask what you listen to these 

days. It’s pretty much just alright. 
Come Friday, if you find yourself 

head-banging to a dude with a high-
lighted mullet striding around the stage 
— gesticulating like the most avuncular of 
professors as he wails, “Who’s gonna call 
on Sunday Morning?/ Who’s gonna drive 
you home?” — you can pretend you’ve 
gotten lost on your way to something, uh, 
cooler. But don’t be afraid to stick around 
and shed a few tears while Christian sin-
gle-handedly raises the scars your high-
school sweetheart left with the bombastic, 
despairing “Feel Good Drag.” Sniff.

contrast to the heaps of stale electronic outfits populat-
ing the Canuck club scene. 

Instead of having serious stare-downs with their 
laptops, the group’s stage presence is wily and unpre-
dictable, applying a kitchen-sink approach to its musi-
cal repertoire. Brian Borcherdt and Graham Walsh 
each man a massive table covered in mini-Casios and 
assorted analog gear — none of the band’s sound comes 
from a computer screen.

On tracks like “Royal Gregory,” the members even 
incorporate ad-lib squelches by yanking film through 
a 35-mm film synchronizer. Matts McQuaid and 
Schulz helm bass guitar and drums, respectively, serve 
as the Owen Biddle and Questlove of the indie-dance 
genre.

Fun is the endgame for Fuck, as heard through the 
krautrock-meets-Fatboy Slim buoyancy of “Milkshake”, 
which sounds improvised but stays on course with its 
distorted yelps and throb-bass framework

 Just think: our precious student fees are going to a 
Canadian collective with the word Fuck in its name.

It really does’t get better than that.

Weed. We pulled off and 
parked at the gas super-
station, glanced at the day’s 
news stories in the Weed 
Press, and then went explor-
ing. This trucker hangout was 
filled with gems like a “I Got 
High in Weed, California” hat 
and a “Shut the Duck Up!” 
T-shirt — an image of a mal-
lard whose bill is duct-taped 
shut. It was a welcome break 
from the monotonous desert 
landscape.

After what seemed like 
forever, we arrived 
in PDX and got 
some much-need-
ed chill time. Our 
show was in the 
Portland ’burbs, at 
a mutual friend’s 
house with an 
empty basement 
just begging for 
us to play in. We 
jammed and made 
friends with locals 
Oliver and Carly, 
who wanted to us 
to eat some real 
Oregon cuisine 
post-rock. 

They took us 
to Burgerville, 
baby, and it was delicious. 
We sat cross-legged on the 
parking-lot gravel in a circle 
of communion, eating our 
Tillamook Cheddar Baskets 
with smiles of ecstasy. There 
was no way anyone could put 
a blemish on our night. 

Except for the Hugs.
We cruised back to the 

house where we’d played 
and hung out with our new 

Portland homies, our gear 
safely stowed in the Econovan. 
Just as we were about to take 
off, the Hugs showed up; it 
was nearing 12:30 a.m., and 
they still hadn’t made an 
appearance.

A lanky, strung-out dude 
exited their van and sulked 
over to us.

“Hey … are you guys in the 
other bands?” he asked, defi-
nitely on downers. “Hey man, 
do you think we could borrow 
your P.A. and a kick-drum 
pedal? Thanks. Oh, and a 

microphone too?”
We were 

pissed. Not only 
was this dude 
not expressing 
his gratitude, he 
wasn’t even in 
the band. Just a 
roadie, or some-
thing. The Hugs 
had sent one of 
their messengers 
because they were 
too lame to ask 
us themselves. 
Grudgingly, we 
accepted their 
request; there were 
still lots of kids 
who wanted to see 

them, despite their douche-
baggery. Without another 
word, we pulled our gear out, 
leaving a disheveled backseat, 
and hauled all the shit back 
into the basement.

While the Hugs played 
like a disaffected flower-
power Strokes, we all lined up 
and peed on their van. It was 
the right thing to do.

We were heading south. 

So long, City of Roses. On 
the way back, we played a 
totally empty coffee-shop 
show in Sacramento, then 
made the hellish drive on the 
I-5 back to LA, and onward 
to San Diego. We had our last 
band sleepover in our friend 
Arturo’s cozy campervan 
after a show in La Mesa. The 
dream was coming to a close. 
A sketchy downtown LA 
show and a good night’s sleep 
later, we were back to reality.

All that was left was our 
homecoming, Thousand Oaks, 
a final concert in the company 
of friends. It had to be in 
Andy’s backyard, for after a 
handful of magical pool-party 
BBQs, it had almost become 
tradition. We set up our gear, 
savoring each roar of feedback 
as we played again to the kids 
who were all there to see us off 
at the beginning.

But the only way to really 
finish the tour was with a 
meal, so we caravanned 
to In-n-Out. I thought 
Burgerville was in the same 
fast-food league as the 
California institution, but I 
had a hard time convincing 
the rest of the gang. When we 
finished our Double-Doubles, 
we took a group picture in 
front of the Econovan, mak-
ing stupid faces but really just 
being bummed it was over. 
We’d bonded so much over the 
trip that it was weird saying 
goodbye, after spending every 
waking moment together — 
and every night a-spoon — for 
two weeks straight. I went 
home and passed out, think-
ing of adventures to come.

O ne part Floyd, one part bossa nova and one part elevator music, the Clientele’s Bonfires on the Heath proves that a solid shtick isn’t always a 
good thing.

Think of the album as half of a cosine wave: It 
starts off strong for a brief moment, climbing steadi-
ly upward, then drops straight downhill toward an 
infinite void — all the while remaining wholly and 
utterly unsexy. 

The first track, “I Wonder Who We Are,” fea-
tures Alasdair MacLean in a role we’re actually glad 
to hear him in: slow, Ella Fitzgerald-esque scatter 
with big-band percussive piano and horns to back 
him. 

From there on, however, we might as well be 
sucking down a bottle of Codeine. “Bonfires on the 
Heath” drowns us in guitar slides upon guitar slides 
to the point of “Revolution 9” repetition — about as 
much listenability as a metronome.

With flu season and cough-induced insomnia en 
route, this snooze-button album isn’t entirely inap-
propriate. And, all sarcasm aside, there are a few 
tracks that approach the band’s earlier, more ener-
getic appeal. But even the funky “Sketch” falls apart 
when MacLean drops in to accompany his breathi-
ness with cowbell overkill.

At least Bob Dylan channels the struggle of the 
people — what’s MacLean’s excuse?

B ack when they mattered, the Backstreet Boys could always be counted on to churn out albums chock full of syrupy, lovelorn ballads and high-energy teen pop. Even amid 
those sparkly slews of hit-factory pop, they still managed to 
produce infectious, stuck-in-your-head lyrics and harmonies 
that adult males would secretly hum. But on their newest, most 
“mature” effort, This Is Us, most cuts play like rejects from Justin 
Timberlake’s 2006 banger FutureSex/LoveSounds — that is, if 
they’d been written five years before. 

The boys embrace a new techno — taking tips from Kayne’s 
vocoder-heavy hits — and attempt to reinvent themselves as a 
modern dance-pop number, more appropriate for the clubgoing 
crowd than a preteen Discman circa 1997.

Attempts to modernize go so far as a vampire-themed video 
for first single “Straight Through My Heart,” though the group 
has kept a few familiar elements: synchronized dancing, harmo-
nized solos and, of course, repetitive choruses that burn them-
selves into your neurons. 

The new dance/trance element detracts from the gooey 
charm that made the group so popular all those years ago. Their 
old shout-from-the-top-of-your-lungs choruses are barely pres-
ent, and the yearning ballads don’t even make an appearance. 
By working again with Max Martin — one of BSB’s former 
producers — high-end production makes them into a bunch of 
European Top 40-wannabes landing in America for the first time. 
This Is Us will be fine for the dingier of dance floors, but a small 
piece of nostalgia makes us wish they’d hit us with something 
more extreme than today’s flimsy trends.

Backstreet’s Back, Shucking Boy-
Band Pop for the Auto-Tune Trend

W hen Air first made their English-language debut with Moon Safari back in 1998, the album’s crisp ambient beats and hits like “Sexy Boy” and “You Make it Easy” cemented the French electronic duo’s reputation as 
purveyors of seduction. Eleven years later, Air continue to deliver with Love 
2, a throwback to their “Virgin Suicides” soundtrack, steeped in tracks that 
would meld just as well into the background of a tender, indie-romance flick. 

This film begins on a stormy night: Our heroine stands under the light 
of a single streetlamp while six-minute gem “Tropical Disease” sets the scene 
with shimmering notes of cascading instrumentation. Dashing into the near-
est building for refuge, she serendipitously meets her love interest in a dim 
lounge filled with the dense, rich beats of the appropriately named “Love.” 

The plot shifts to the male perspective as they dance to yearning ballad 
“So Light is her Footfall” (“Such a five-minute stranger/ I wish I could have 
her/ She is an angel”). The two head back to his place only to find dire devel-
opments ruin their plans. The drama is appropriately emphasized by odd 
number “Eat My Beat,” one of the album’s weaker tracks, whose title alone 
makes it a Michael Jackson tribute gone wrong.

The heroine temporarily wallows in despair on “Missing the Light of the 
Day” — a robotic, repetitive jingle that harkens the far-off “Sexy Boy.” Not to 
be deterred, she quickly rebounds and pursues her man, with the feisty “Be 
a Bee” as motivation. Their last obstacle overcome, the two reunite among 
cheerful plucks and melancholy, foreshadowing lines (“Nothing lasts/ It’s bet-
ter that way”) on “Sing Sang Sung.”

In the years since Air’s debut, a new crop of French electrodes has 
emerged (see: Justice, Phoenix), but this duo is still creating atmospheric 
LPs with gorgeous sonic subtlety. Give Love 2 a spin and get lost in reverie. 
Imagine it into your own film, or better yet, invite someone along and take 
some advice from the album’s lead single “Do the Joy.” You can thank me later.

FILMREVIEW

Introspective Family Drama Shatters Language Barrier
By Philip Rhie
Senior Staff Writer

Family issues are hard to take seriously. Bring them up in casual conversation, and you’re 
sure to get stares. It’s no wonder 
that in television shows and movies 
alike, family dramas are consistently 
reduced to comedic farce or tear-
jerking melodrama. It’s easier to brush 
aside conflict than to deal with it.

In real life, though, rarely can a 

problem be simplified into a punch 
line. Hirozaku Koreeda confronts this 
topic in “Still Walking,” the acclaimed 
director’s latest analysis of family life.

“Walking” is defined by its 
Japanese heritage, and Koreeda works 
hard to portray the essence of his cul-
ture’s beauty. In the opening sequenc-
es, we’re greeted by rolling Japanese 
landscapes and lush cherry blossoms 
— moving cinematography that seems 
to mimic still-life. The director shifts 
thoughtfully between frames, focusing 

heavily on Japanese iconography. By 
the time we’re introduced to the cast, 
we’re already so enraptured by their 
culture that we’ve almost completely 
forgotten our own. 

While the film is a family drama, 
it centers on smaller conflicts that 
grow beneath the surface of familial 
temperament during the anniversary 
of the eldest son’s death. As the family 
converges to reflect on their loss, we 
are introduced to two distinct genera-
tions and their deep resentments of 

one another.
Ryota (Hiroshi Abe), the eldest liv-

ing son, harbors bitterness towards his 
father for undermining his career deci-
sions. In turn, Ryota’s father resents his 
son for not following in his footsteps 
and becoming a doctor. Ryota’s mother 
disapproves of Ryota’s marriage to 
Yukari, (Yui Natsukawa) a widowed 
mother. Yukari, in turn, resents that 
she is resented. And so it goes.

But the film’s true beauty lies in 
the fact that none of these conflicts 

are ever completely visible. Instead, 
hostility is manifested in passive-
aggressive remarks left for the audi-
ence to decode. Subtlety is the name 
of the game, and it is our job to put 
the pieces of the family’s complicated 
history together.

While the tension never loosens 
its grip, by the end of Ryota’s visit, all 
rough edges have been smoothed out, 
and the characters — us included — 
are left with a satisfying sense of hope 
for a better future.

ed 8-6 by Sonoma players Olson and 
Taylor Bianco. Apart from the loss, 
UCSD won all its second-round dou-
bles contests on the second day of the 
tournament. 

Redshirt junior Alex Placek and 
sophomore Chapman Chan beat 
Sonoma State duo Bryce Keefer and 
Quan Vu 9-8 in a closely fought 
matchup that earned them a spot in 
the doubles semifinals. 

Emami and West sunk Grand 
Canyon University duo Eric Schroeder 
and Brian Kirby 8-3, propelling them-
selves forward in the tournament. 

Fellow and sophomore Sam 
Ling sealed a 9-7 victory against the 
Broncos’ top doubles team Joshua 
Lau and Keith Boggero to round up 
UCSD’s doubles events on Friday.

The Oct. 3 semifinal round com-
menced with Emami and West defeat-
ing fellow UCSD pair Placek and 
Chan 8-5 to advance to the tourna-
ment’s final match. 

Sonoma State duo Olson and 
Bianco defeated Fellow and Ling in a 
grueling 9-7 battle to earn their  spot 
in the championship game against 
Emami and West. The UCSD duo 
played strong en route to an 8-5 vic-
tory, dispatching their Sonoma State 
opponents and claiming the tourna-
ment championship.

“It was tied 6-6, and the other team 
came up with some big serves,” head 
coach Eric Steidlmayer said. “[Emami 
and West] just hung in there and were 
able to pull out the win.” 

On the women’s side, the third 
round proved to be UCSD’s downfall. 
Sophomore Krystal Mizuguchi was 
defeated 6-0, 6-1 by one of the brack-
et’s top seeds: BYU-Hawaii sopho-
more Yuan Ji. 

In the same round, junior Roxanna 

Pourmirzaie lost to Cal Poly Pomona’s 
Jackie Trendt 6-2, 6-2. 

Katie Mulloy and Samantha 
Yeung, the remaining Triton singles 
players, were unable to move past the 
third round. 

However, despite their elimina-
tion in the singles bracket, Mulloy 
and Pourmirzaie formed a doubles 
team that provided UCSD’s lone vic-
tory in Oct. 2’s women’s tournament. 
They defeated Cal State Los Angeles’ 
Dori Kiss and Linda Majzlikova 8-4. 
Mulloy and Pourmirzaie could not, 
however, continue their roll, and were 
knocked out in the quarterfinals by a 
Cal Poly Pomona pair.

“I was really impressed with how 
the team hung in there,” women’s head 
coach Liz LaPlante said. “For the first 
matches of the season, I was pleased.”

UCSD’s other doubles pair, Yeung 
and Mizuguchi, lost 8-0 to BYU-
Hawaii’s No. 1-seeded team, ending 
the Triton women’s run in the ITA 
West Region Championship.

Emami and West will represent 
the entire West Region at the ITA 
National Championship, which will 
be held in Mobile, Ala., from Oct. 
15 to Oct. 17. UCSD’s last showing 
at  the ITA National Championship 
was in 2007, by doubles partners Eric 
Rubens and Blake Meister. 

West said she was very pleased 
with the Tritons’ first tournament 
of the 2009 season, and hopes they 
maintain their momentum.

“We stayed positive throughout 
the game and kept playing hard,” West 
said. “We need to keep our consis-
tency from the baseline going [for the 
ITA National Championship].”

Before the ITA National 
Championship, the men will face 
Point Loma Nazarene University on 
Oct. 9. The Triton women will be back 
in action on Nov. 14 and Nov. 15 to 
compete at UC Irvine.

“I feel as though our team under-
achieved, which is a common prob-
lem we have when we play teams that 
are not as good as us,” Pavitt said. 
“We played down to the level that 
Humboldt brought, which allowed 
them back into the game at times when 
we should have been three goals ahead. 
At the end of the day, we got the win 
— which is the most important thing 
— and now we have a couple practices 
to get stuff right before we are on the 
road again.”

The victory against Humboldt was 
a much-needed boost for the Triton 
squad who had failed to take down 
Sonoma State two days prior. 

Seeking to upset the CCAA North 
Division-leading Seawolves, UCSD 

turned out an intense and heated game. 
Despite outshooting the Seawolves 

19-14, the Tritons lost at home for the 
first time this season. 

UCSD claimed an early lead: Junior 
midfielder Shane Micheil scored the 
game’s first goal on a header in the 19th 
minute, but was unable to score again 
for the rest of the game. 

The Tritons’ lone goal got its start 
when Bakal drove the ball up the left 
side of the field, then lifted a cross over 
the box. Micheil pushed it in with a 
header for a 1-0 lead. 

Sonoma junior forward Brandon 
de la Cruz quickly erased his team’s 
deficit by scoring two goals, steering 
the Seawolves to a 2-1 victory. 

Sonoma State has remained unde-
feated in conference play throughout 
2009.

“It was a pretty even game,” senior 
forward Tony Choi said. “It could have 
gone either way, but Sonoma took bet-
ter advantage of their chances. Once 
again, we have been having problems 
finding the back of the net. Both of 
their goals were mainly due to a lack of 
focus on defense, as we did not track 
our runners. We just need to be a bit 
sharper and take care of the ball.”

The Tritons’ next challenge is a 
home-and-away series with Cal State 
East Bay, starting with a 12:30 p.m. 
match in Hayward on Oct. 9. UCSD  
will then host the Cal State East Bay 
Pioneers on Oct. 11 at 12 p.m. The 
Pioneers are 1-10 on the season (0-7-0 
CCAA).

The Tritons will race again at the 
Triton Classic on Oct. 10, their last 
home meet of the season. 

Though they will be competing 
at the same event as the men, the 
women’s team will return to the nor-
mal 6K length, while the men will 
have their first competition on the 10K 
course — the distance at which they 
will have to compete in the conference

The race also serves as the Tritons’

TENNIS — The UCSD men’s and wom-
en’s tennis teams began their seasons at the 
Intercollegiate Tennis Association West Region 
Championships, held at the Cal Poly Pomona 
campus from Oct. 1 to Oct. 3. 

The Triton men kicked off the 2009 cam-
paign with several victories at the tournament: 
A UCSD doubles team took first place, and two 
singles players advanced to the semifinal round. 

Despite sweeping all nine of their opening-
day matches on Oct. 1, the women’s team suc-
cumbed to tougher competition on day two, 
when they were eliminated from the tourna-
ment.

Junior Armaun Emami was very pleased 
with its season-opening performance, credit-
ing the strong start to intensive training and 
preparation.

“Before the game, we went over our plans and 
strategies,” Emami said. “Coach [Steidlmayer] 

kept boosting our confidence. We knew we had 
to capitalize on our opportunities.” 

The lone Tritons who emerged unscathed 
from the late-round matches were Emami and 
redshirt freshman Austin West, whose doubles 
team defeated a Sonoma State duo to claim the 
ITA West Region doubles championship. 

The title earns Emami and West an automat-
ic ticket to the ITA National Championships, 
which will be held from Oct. 15 to Oct. 17 in 
Mobile, AL.

Both the men’s and women’s teams won with 
ease on the tournament’s first day, but ran into 
trouble in the quarter and semifinal games on 
Oct. 2 and Oct. 3. 

Junior Erik Elliot comfortably defeated 
Sonoma State’s Anthony Rollins 6-0, 6-4 in his 
quarterfinal match, but lost in the semifinals to 
Brigham Young University Hawaii’s Agnel Peter 
6-2, 2-6,10-8. Similarly, sophomore Jake Fellow 
defeated UCSD teammate Emami, 6-2, 6-1

MEN’S SOCCER — UCSD battled through one of the 
most challenging stretch of season games last week. 
The men hosted a match against the first nationally 
ranked opponent they’ve played so far, Sonoma State, 
on Oct. 2, before taking on Humboldt State on Oct. 4. 

The Sonoma State Seawolves protected their 
No. 7 ranking by topping the Tritons 2-1. UCSD’s 
offense woke up in the weekend’s final match against 
Humboldt State, however, paced by the solid play of 
junior midfielder David Bakal to win 2-1. 

The Tritons now stand 5-3-4 overall and 2-3-3 in 
California Collegiate Athletic Association play. 

In the victory against Humboldt State, the Tritons 
wasted no time: as Bakal kicked UCSD’s first goal  
only two minutes into the game. Bakal’s opening 
score fired up UCSD’s offense, whose inability to 
score consistently has plagued the team throughout 
the season. 

The game’s second goal came in the 38th minute, 
off the foot of freshman midfielder Kian Malek, 
whose first career score as a Triton gave his team a 
2-0 lead.

“We finally took advantage of our chances and 
were able to finish goals for the most part,” senior 
forward Tony Choi said. “We did not play our best 
game, but came out with a win just by sticking 
together as a team. We definitely needed to take care 
of the ball because their only chances really came off 
our mistakes. Their goal was just a bit of miscommu-
nication, and we basically handed it to them. Besides 
that, they really had no chances.”

Senior Jonathan Sawyer was the driving force of 
the initial Triton attack, driving the ball up the left 
side of the field and crossing it toward the goal. Bakal 
took the pass from six yards out and headed it past 
the Humboldt keeper into the left end of the net. 

Senior forward Tony Choi and freshman forward 
Evan Walker got assists on Malek’s goal to help bol-
ster the Triton offense. Senior keeper Peter Akman 
had a total of four saves throughout the game, carry-
ing on a season-long dominance between the posts. 

Though the Tritons were victorious, senior 
defender Danny Pavit felt there was room for

CROSS COUNTRY – In a non colle-
giate event open to the San Diego run-
ning community, the UCSD men’s and 
women’s cross country teams turned 
in top performances, simultaneously 
using the meet as an opportunity to 
give its second-string athletes invalu-
able racing experience.

Senior Jesse Morrill led the Tritons, 
finishing first overall in the Ursula 
Rains 5K Race at Balboa Park on Oct. 
3. The team placed five runners in the 
top 25 at the open meet. 

Hosted by the San Diego Track 
Club, the 5K race drew many of the 
best amateur runners in the greater 
San Diego area and deviated from typi-
cal Triton meets in distance and com-
petition: Both the men and women 
raced the 5K together, instead of the 
usual 8K for men and 6K for women.

“We have a great running com-
munity here in San Diego,” head coach 
Nate Garcia said. “I really liked the 
opportunity to get our team exposed to 
them, and them exposed to our team.”

Morrill, who is redshirting this 
season, finished the course in 15:09 
to win the race by over 15 seconds 
— beating out San Marcos’ Nazario 
Romero. Senior Mike Wright was the 
next Triton finisher, recording a time 
of 16:02 to take 11th place. 

Sophomore Alex Corliss, freshman 
Mike Rizzo and sophomore John Svet 
rounded out UCSD’s top finishes, com-
ing in 16th, 20th and 21st, respectively. 

All-American junior Bre Schofield 
returned after missing the previous 
meet on Sept. 26, and once again fin-
ished as UCSD’s top female runner. A 
time of 18:10 made her the sixth fastest 
woman in the race and earned her 66th 
place overall in the competition. 

After watching from the sidelines 
for nearly two weeks with an illness, 
Schofield was happy to be racing again. 

“To get out there and know what 
it feels like and know what I need to 
be doing was such a good thing to do 
before Triton [Classic],” Schofield said. 
“To get the experience in was definitely 
beneficial.”

Following Schofield were senior 
Jordana Henderson in 119th place and 
freshman Catherine Crisp in 128th 
place. Altogether, the race saw over 260 
competitors.

The meet fell between the Pre-
Nationals Invitational in Indiana on 
Sept. 26 and the upcoming Triton 
Classic on Oct. 10 — two of the 
Tritons’ biggest meets of the season. 
Garcia said he only allowed those that 
did not travel to Indiana in September 
to compete because he wanted to have 
his entire team fresh for the upcoming 
home meet. 

With higher-profile races 
approaching in the coming week, the 
Ursula Rains 5K allowed UCSD to 
gain experience, and — at the very 
least — get reacquainted with race-day 
conditions. 

“Most of the people who raced 
[at the Ursula Rains 5K] hadn’t raced 
since the meet on Sept. 12,” Garcia 
said. “We wanted to get them out there, 
basically as a confidence booster ahead 
of the Triton [Classic] next week.”

The Tritons who did not race in the 
Ursula Rains 5K volunteered instead 
to help with the logistics and setup of 
the meet.

“I felt like it was a good opportunity 
for our program, not only in the racing 

TRITON DUO SCORES SPOT IN ITA NATIONALS

UCSD’s doubles team of Armaun Emami and 
Austin West swept through the ITA West Region 
Championships to earn a spot at the national tour-
nament in Mobile, AL on Oct. 15-17. By defeating

final round, Emami and Austin will be UCSD’s 
sole representative at the national event.
