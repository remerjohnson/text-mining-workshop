Chancellor Marye Anne Fox 
announced in a campuswide e-mail last 
week that the University of California 
endorses Proposition 1A, an initiative 
on the upcoming California ballot that 
would draw funds for state colleges 
from a $16 billion tax increase. 

Proposition 1A is one of six mea-
sures on the May 19 special-election 
ballot. Also known as the Budget 
Stabilization Act, it would mitigate the 
$41.6 billion state budget shortfall by 
establishing annual spending limits for 
the state Legislature and increasing the 
amount of funds in California’s “rainy 
day” reserve to protect the UC system 
from future budget reductions. 

The new funds would be raised by 
extending the recently approved 1 per-
cent sales-tax increase by one year. The 
two-year vehicle license-fee increase 
and 0.25 percent income-tax hike 
would be extended to four years. The 
proposition would also eliminate the 
$200 tax credit families receive every 
year for each dependent child. 

The new tax hikes would cost the 
average family over $1,100 per year. 

Under the initiative, revenue would 
be pumped into California’s general 
fund beginning in 2010 and ending 
in 2013. About $9.3 billion could flow 
back into education over time. 

Although the specific financial ben-
efits to the UC system have not been 
determined, the funds would be used 
to support the university’s instructional 
services, including faculty, staff and 
student support such as scholarships, 
said Lynn Tierney, associate vice presi-
dent of communications at the UC 
Office of the President. 

Opponents of the measure — 
including the Service Employees 

International Union and the California 
School Boards Association — argue that 
the new taxes would hurt low-income 
residents and small businesses. The 
Howard Jarvis Taypayers Association, 
California’s leading taxpayer organiza-
tion, labeled the measure the “worst 
anti-family tax package in history.”

The California School Boards 
Association said in a statement that 
Proposition 1A adds “more broken 
layers to an already broken system,” 
and would only provide short-term 
benefits by “arbitrarily restricting state 
spending.”  

In order to prevent the state 
Legislature from overspending, rev-
enue that exceeds California’s average 
general fund growth of 5 to 6 percent 
annually would go into the “rainy day” 
reserve. The reserve would be capped 
at 12.5 percent of general funds, which 
sit at roughly $12 billion, a significant 
increase from the current 5 percent cap. 

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is a 
strong supporter of Proposition 1A. 
The initiative will directly benefit com-
munity colleges, the UC system and  
the California State University system, 
spokeswoman for the governor’s office 
Julie Soderlund said.

“It ties the hands of state legis-
latures,” she said. “We want to have 
responsible growth in government and 
not create programs we can’t sustain. 
The state will be required to save money 
in good [economic] years so we’ll have 
funding in bad years. For example, 2006 
was a really good [fiscal] year, but we 
spent all the money, with no savings to 
alleviate cuts and tax increases.”

If Proposition 1A is not approved, 
the university could face another round 
of cuts, according to UCOP spokesman 
Ricardo Vazquez. 

The current $450 million deficit for 
the UC system includes $115 million 
in new reductions, $122 million in the 
11,000 unfunded enrollments and $213 
million in unfunded mandatory costs, 
such as utilities and employee health 
benefits.

Chemistry and biochemistry pro-
fessor Mario J. Molina was appointed 
to the President’s Council of Advisors 
on Science and Technology last week.

Alongside  22 of the nation’s lead-
ing scientists, Molina will advise the 
president and vice president on issues 
involving sci-
ence and tech-
nology that 
affect national 
policy and eco-
nomic growth.

Prior to his 
appointment, 
Molina served 
as a scientific 
policy advisor 
on President 
Barack Obama’s transition team. 
He also served on the PCAST from 
1993 to 2001 during both of former 

President Bill Clinton’s terms.
Among Obama’s other PCAST 

appointees are Google Chairman 
and CEO Eric Schmidt, President 
and CEO of the American Board of 
Internal Medicine Christine Cassel 
and Microsoft Chief Research and 
Strategy Officer Craig Mundie. The 
team includes a total of three Nobel 
laureates, two university presidents, 
four MacArthur recipients and 14 
other notable scholars. 

Molina said he expects this panel 
to be “more proactive” than former 
President George W. Bush’s panel 
in allocating resources to scientific 
research. The panel will formulate pol-
icies to sustain scientific research and 
development. 

Molina teaches at both UCSD and 
the Center for Atmospheric Sciences at 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography. 

Charles Kennel, former director of 
SIO and senior strategist for UCSD’s 
Sustainability Solutions Institute, said 

Molina is a spectacular role model for 
young scientists at UCSD.

“Mario has walked the talk in the 
area of atmospheric pollution,” Kennel 
said. “His leadership of Mexico City’s 
efforts to understand and curb its air 
pollution … has set an example for the 
rest of us. It was not just his abilities 
in science; by example, he inspired 
atmospheric scientists, public-health 
specialists, policymakers and govern-
ment officials.” 

Molina received the Nobel Prize in 
Chemistry in 1995 for identifying the 
impact of chlorofluorocarbon gas on 
the atmosphere. He is a member of the 
National Academy of Sciences and the 
Institute of Medicine.

Molina will split his time between 
PCAST, the Molina Center for Energy 
and the Environment in Mexico City 
and a research group in San Diego 
investigating the chemical properties

The UC Board of Regents will 
vote on a $662-per-quarter increase 
in student fees over the phone this 
week. 

Plans for discussing the tuition 
hike were originally scheduled to take 
place later this week at UCSD, but in 
a statement issued May 1, the regents 
said the meeting would be switched 
to a teleconference in order to avoid 
distracting campus officials from 

efforts to combat the swine-flu virus. 
“Our decision to conduct the 

meeting telephonically is to ensure 
we do not divert the attention or 
resources of the campus as they work 
to keep the campus community safe 
and prevent any health issues related 
to the H1N1 flu,” Chair of the Board 
of Regents Richard Blum said. “We 
thought it best to meet our legal and 
operational obligations and conduct 
the meeting by phone, without ask-
ing the campus to stretch resources 
better applied elsewhere during this 
challenging time.”

Initially scheduled to take place 
over the course of three days this 
week, the meeting will now be con-
ducted in its entirety on May 7. The 

regents will discuss approving a $626 
increase in the systemwide student 
educational fee, in addition to a $36 
increase in the systemwide student 
registration fee.

The teleconference format will 
derail plans by students to stage a 
series of demonstrations against the 
fee increase during the regents’ dis-
cussion.

A.S. Vice President of External 
Affairs Lisa Chen, along with stu-
dents from UC Santa Barbara, UC 
Riverside, UCLA and the systemwide 
UC Students Association, planned 
to stage a rally at UCSD on May 6 to 
raise awareness about the proposed 
fee increases. 

“We were exposing this myth that 

the regents are trying to push where 
they’re saying, ‘Oh, don’t worry, you’ll 
be covered by the federal stimulus 
plan or you’ll be covered by the new 
Blue and Gold plan,’” Chen said. “It’s 

sort of this high-aid, high-fee model, 
and we’re trying to expose that as 
far as the fact that it’s not sustain-

Board to vote on $662 
increase in student fees 
via teleconference.

of atmospheric particles. The major-
ity of Molina’s research focuses on 
the Earth’s atmosphere and human 
impacts on the environment. 

Obama spoke to the NAS and 
newly elected members of the PCAST 
on April 27.

“This council represents leaders 
from many scientific disciplines who 
will bring a diversity of experience and 
views,” he said. “I will charge PCAST 
with advising me about national strate-
gies to nurture and sustain a culture of 
scientific innovation.”

At the request of the council, the 
stimulus act signed by Obama on 
Feb. 17 funds an initiative called the 
Advanced Research Projects Agency 
for Energy, which will give money to 
high-risk, high-reward research in 
areas such as advanced biofuels, solar 
panels and batteries for hybrid vehicles.

able, and it’s actually pushing a lot of 
middle-class students that aren’t on 
financial aid into lower-income status 
because of the fee increases.”

Chen was critical of the regents’ 
decision to cancel their UCSD visit.

“It shows how nontransparent the 
regents are and how they’ve con-
tinued to cut students out of the 
decision-making process,” she said. 
“Without any student or anyone 
holding them accountable and no one 
making them feel pressured to vote a 
certain way, there’s no repercussions 
to their vote now.”

Chen said a group of UCSD stu-
dents still plans to publicly address 
the regents’ decision, though the pro-
test will now take place on May 7 at 
9:30 a.m. at Price Center and will 
include a 20-minute public-input ses-
sion at the beginning of the telecon-
ference. 

According to university officials, 
the new fees are designed to com-
pensate for a continued lack of state 
funding, which has left the university 
with a multimillion-dollar budget gap 
over the last several years. 

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s 
2009-10 budget, adopted by the state 
Legislature in February, included 
$115.5 million in new budget reduc-
tions for the university and assumed 
a 9.3 percent increase in student 
fees. 

In addition to addressing the 
proposed tuition hike, the regents 
are expected to approve the 2009-10 
operating budget for the UC Office 
of the President at their Thursday 
meeting.

People love to use acronyms. This is because by choosing a name for your club/party/
legislation that yields a snappy acro-
nym you can 1) disguise your funda-
mentally pointless and probably lame 
pet project as something cool, and 2)  
attempt to retain legitimacy with a 
bureaucratically jumbled title. 

As California’s southernmost 
headquarters for super-clever college-
types, UCSD — which rebranded 
itself this year as UC San Diego, par-
tially because “UCSD” is just a regular 
abbreviation, not a smart-sounding 
buzzword — also loves acronyms. 
At first glance, a list of student 
orgs looks as dry and vague as a 
monotone chem lecture: Innovative 
Design & Engineering Applications, 
Students Taking Action Now: Darfur, 
Friends Understanding Needs, 
Warren Association of Volunteer 
Enthusiasts, Truly Raising Awareness 
for International Needs, Pre-Medical 
Association of Students for Service, 
Fellowship of International Service 
and Health.

But put on your cereal-box acro-
nym goggles and you’ve got an action-
packed catalogue of super-awesome 
clubs: I.D.E.A., S.T.A.N.D., F.U.N., 
W.A.V.E., T.R.A.I.N., P.A.S.S., F.I.S.H. 
— who wouldn’t want to join?! 

The thing is, while Innovative 
Design & Engineering Applications 
may generally relate to an “idea” con-
cept on some level, F.I.S.H. has abso-
lutely nothing to do with fish, fishing, 
aquatic life or even the coast. Yeah, 
kind of misleading.

By trying to be memorable, all 
these T.R.A.I.N., W.A.V.E., F.I.S.H. 
people have totally undermined their 
mission. Locomotive, surf and sea-
food enthusiasts who add their names 
to a Library Walk signup sheet will 
be sorely disappointed to find them-
selves spammed on a listserv that has 
nothing to do with their interests, 
while students who are actually into 
volunteering and international service 
will likely overlook those clubs’ alter 
egos and avoid them altogether. 

Even those groups that have mas-
tered the acronym balance — choos-
ing both a name and acronym that 
relate to the club’s purpose — still 
end up with kind of lame names, 
like Students Taking the Initiative To 
Crochet Hats. Sure, S.T.I.T.C.H. is an 
alright abbreviation. It’s cute sound-
ing and reminds you of crafts, and 
crochet enthusiasts looking to join a 
student org will recognize the term 
and know to join. But what does the 
name even mean?

“Hey Hadley, what are you doing 
this weekend?”

“Well on Sunday I have to work, 
but on Saturday I’m taking the initia-
tive to crochet hats! It’s going to be 
pretty awesome. You should take the 
initiative too.”

Clubs like this should just commit 
already. If you want a cute and catchy 
name, give yourself a cute and catchy 
name. I mean, if you want to be the 
Stitch Club, just be the Stitch Club — 
people will figure it out.

Dear Editor,
In response to Omair Qazi’s April 

27 article titled “The Worth of Your 
Shiny Gold Star,” NSCS would like to 
issue the following statement to show 
members and potential members the 
benefits of joining NSCS, and Qazi’s 
complete oversights and lack of ability 
to recognize opportunity.

In his article, Qazi attacks the 
national branch for allotting 2 percent 
of its total revenue to scholarships 
for its members. He compares it to 
Tau Beta Pi, of which he approves, 
which allocates 9 percent of its rev-
enue to scholarship. In essence, Qazi 
is arguing over 7 percent. Not only 
does Qazi omit the fact that Tau Beta 
Pi has a higher membership fee, he 
conveniently omits the fact that NSCS 
provides members with many oppor-
tunities not offered by other honor 
societies.

Just this year alone, we have had 
two extraordinary scholars from 
UCSD win NSCS’s biggest opportu-
nities: the Merit Scholar award (free 
ride for a year), and the opportunity 
to travel to Washington, D.C., to wit-
ness President Barack Obama’s inau-
guration, as well as the opportunity to 
meet him in person. Just being able to 
have these opportunities is well worth 

the $75 spent, wouldn’t you agree? 
In regard to the expensive national 
convention costs — we cannot deny 
the fact that they take a toll in our 
budgets, but it is a national conven-
tion; you have the opportunity to 
meet NSCS scholars from all over 
the country, in our nation’s beautiful 
capital. Many may think of this trip 
as a money sink, but networking is 
priceless. You never know who your 
future boss may be.

Not only that, NSCS provides an 
excellent discount on MCAT, LSAT 
or any other professional test prepa-
ration courses. Just by having the 
NSCS name on you, you can save 
hundreds — I repeat, hundreds  —  
on these preparatory classes. Just by 
crunching the numbers, as it seems 
that previous article failed to do, a 
few hundred is much greater than 
the $75 that is paid.

For those of you who are mem-
bers, and for those of you who 
have been invited and are consid-
ering joining, I hope you can see 
NSCS offers a wide range of oppor-
tunities and experiences. Being an 
active member will enable you to get 
involved with your community and 
meet fellow members, and will con-
tribute to your overall development 
both as a student and as a member of 
society. The UCSD chapter of NSCS 
is thriving, and all of our officers 
look forward to meeting new mem-

bers at induction in the fall. 
If you have any further questions 

or concerns about joining or want to 
know more about our chapter, feel 
free to check out our Web site at nsc-
satucsd.com or email shc004@ucsd.
edu. I am proud of our organization, 
and most of all, I am proud of all of 
you for making the decision to be 
part of NSCS.

Dear Editor,
My name is Utsav Gupta, and I 

am your next Associated Students 
Council president. I want to extend 
a hand of invitation to the entire 
student body to get more involved 
in its student government.

There are many ways that one 
can get involved with the A.S. 
Council. We now have our associ-
ate vice president applications avail-
able online at as.ucsd.edu. These are 
some of the most important posi-
tions on the council, and they target 
specific areas of interest, such as stu-
dent organizations, athletic relations 
and programming. Check out all the 
details on our Web site.

Soon, we will be introducing a 
new A.S. Council internship pro-
gram, where any student can get 
involved. This application will also 
be available online at our Web site 
in the next week or so. Be sure to 
check back.

It doesn’t matter how much expe-
rience you have, what your qualifica-
tions are or what you want to do in 
the future. The only requirement for 
any of these positions is an interest 
in getting involved and a willingness 
to become invested in something 
that affects every student on campus.

If you have any questions about 
how you can get involved, or any 
other questions, comments or 
concerns, feel free to e-mail me at 
utsav@ucsd.edu.

STUDENT LIFE — It might not be 
a bad idea to start stockpiling oily 
cartons of Sierra Summit wok noodles 
in your minifridge — because even if 
you’re not a John Muir College student, 
it’s about to get a lot harder to grab a 
quick bite on campus.

Housing, Dining and Hospitality 
Associate Director Steve Casad has 
promised the upcoming closures of 
Sierra Summit and El Mercado won’t 
make for overcrowded dining halls 
around campus next year. But simple 
arithmetic would suggest otherwise: 
By all predictions, roughly the same 
number of dorm-dwellers divided by 
fewer dining halls with the same num-
ber of employees equals a much longer 
wait for your garden burger. It’s already 
common to wait upward of 30 minutes 
at Summit’s wok station; and come 
next fall, students shouldn’t be shocked 

=VLMZVW]ZQ[PML�IVL�7^MZ�\PM�?IQ\
+WUQVO�<PQ[�.ITT�\W�I�,QVQVO�0ITT�6MIZ�AW]

Get your burger while 
it’s hot, because John 
Muir College’s dining-
hall cuts will mean 
longer lines and fewer 
options for everyone.

to find themselves in a never-ending 
line for a partially-grilled cheese sand-
wich. 

Granted, the closing of Muir’s caf-
eterias doesn’t quite signify the end 
of civilization as we know it. Mercado 
serves only 100 to 150 students per 
meal period (breakfast, lunch and din-
ner) — but Summit serves 500 to 600, 
all of whom will soon have to dine else-
where. With so many diners displaced, 
it’s not hard to imagine a kind of 
pandemonium at OceanView Terrace 
that could turn a breakfast burrito 
craving into an hour-long mosh-pit 
experience.

In a perfect world, Housing, Dining 
and Hospitality might have chosen to 
complete the dining-hall renovations 
in phases, perhaps leaving Mercado 
open while Summit gets a hot new 
makeover so that students have at 
least one option in Muir, unhealthy 

though it may be — but Casad said 
that option was never feasible, as the 
two eateries are in fact part of the 
same building, presenting technical 
difficulties with electricity and water 
supply. He also said the renovations 
are far too comprehensive to possi-
bly be completed in a single sum-
mer (perhaps he hasn’t witnessed Ty 
Pennington and company work their 
magic on ABC’s “Extreme Makeover: 
Home Edition,” or didn’t think the net-
work would be too gung-ho about an 
“Extreme Makeover: College Cafeteria 
Edition” special). While Fall Quarter 
will indeed see the opening of two 
new dining facilities that’ll stay open 
until midnight — the Village (think 
Earl’s Place, but in Eleanor Roosevelt 
College) and Goody’s in Thurgood 
Marshall College (think Foodworx, 
but accessible). Casad said the two 
eateries will serve mainly grab-and-go 

items like sandwiches and wraps, with 
Goody’s also equipped with the kind 
of prepared-foods section you’d find at 
Whole Foods. In actuality the pair will 
be procrastination stops to pick up a 
late-night cup of coffee before crank-
ing out a 10-pager. Or a premade salad.

There’s something to be said for the 
fact that at UCSD, we’re pretty spoiled 
as far as cafeteria variety goes — six 
colleges’ worth of options has bred 
a sense of entitlement. But our large 
supply of cafeterias is met with 7,000 
rumbling stomachs seven times a day.

But this obsession isn’t limited to 
student orgs. Our elected officials love 
acronyms too. A few years ago, Tritons 
passed the Promoting Understanding 
and Learning through Service and 
Education (or P.U.L.S.E.) referen-
dum to support the equally vague 
Student Promoted Access Center for 
Education and Services (S.P.A.C.E.S.). 
Now everyone pays a fee to this center, 
the purpose of which is pretty nebu-
lous. And the center’s Web site doesn’t 
do much to clear things up — the 
“ourstory” section gives no description 
of S.P.A.C.E.S. or why it’s even neces-
sary, and instead insists that a majority 

of the student body approved the ref-
erendum (actually, only a majority of 

the 22 percent of students who voted 
approved the referendum). 

Even the federal government 
loves acronyms. The Uniting and 
Strengthening America by Providing 
Appropriate Tools Required to 
Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism 
Act of 2001 (U.S.A. P.A.T.R.I.O.T. 
Act or Patriot Act) is the zenith of 
absurd acronyms. Unfortunately, like 
S.T.A.N.D. and W.A.V.E., the U.S.A. 
P.A.T.R.I.O.T. Act’s name gives only 
vague insight into its mission.

Sure, it’s just a name, but what if 
rather than reading the Guardian, 
you were reading the Getting Up 
And Reporting ’Diego Intellectual 
Activities Newspaper? That would be 
ludicrous. 

Casad said that in addition to the 
closure of Summit and Mercado, the 
closing hours for OVT will be moved 
back from 1 a.m. to 9 p.m, reducing the 
service hours of one of the most fre-
quented eateries on campus while two 
others have been shut down entirely. 

Nevermind the fact that Muir stu-
dents (not to mention those Revelle 
College residents not daring enough 
to eat at less-than-gourmet Plaza 
Cafe) will have to set aside a solid 
chunk of time account for the walk 
to quell their stomachs’ grumblings. 
Housing, Dining and Hospitality 
ought to reconsider reducing OVT’s 
hours in light of the fact that, being 
the next-closest dining facility to 
Muir, it’s going to see a giant surge 
of business next year. It certainly 
wouldn’t hurt to extend the hours of 
Plaza Cafe well beyond its current 8 
p.m. closing either; yet even if Plaza 
were to stay open later, it wouldn’t 
change the fact that Muir residents 

will be paying the same costs as their 
peers, but without the standard ben-
efit of in-college dining. 

While we’ll still be able to swipe 
our IDs for Pop-Tarts and other non-
necessities at 11 p.m., the university 
has a basic obligation to provide each 
of its colleges with lunch- and dinner-
hour meals in a timely manner. We’ve 
got classes to go to, problem sets to 
labor over, papers to write — and a 
tendency to eat unhealthily already. 
Limiting students’ healthy dining-hall 
options will only  encourage greater 
potato-chip consumption.

If there’s one thing that’s evident at 
11:30 p.m. on any weeknight at UCSD, 
it’s that students will wait valiantly in 
line for their beloved breakfast burrito 
— but when those lines are actually 
affecting our daytime ability to eat, 
the university is not fulfilling its basic 
responsibilities.

to date, by the nearly 300 

teams participating in the 
2009 Mongol Rally. 

��!��!�

TEAM GREAT JOB! TRAVERSES THE GLOBE IN
THE ULTIMATE ROAD-TRIP CHARITY DRIVE.

D issatisfied with the prospect of another summer lounging around, UCSD students Ryan Natan, Michael Kelly, Elizabeth 
“Bones” Latham and alumnus Will Parson — 
together known as Team Great Job! — have made 
the decision to strand themselves somewhere 
between London and Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.

It’s called the Mongol Rally: a pseudo-race for 
courageous, charity-minded adventurers. Teams 
drive cars that — according to rally rules — must 
have a one-liter engine (esentially no power) 
and cost less than $2,000. After departing from 
London, Team Great Job! will have less than four 
weeks to drive the nearly 10,000 miles to the home 
of Genghis Khan. The team’s route will take them 
through France, Germany, the Czech Republic, 
Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Russia, Kazakhstan, 
back into Russia and, finally, Mongolia. 

Team Great Job! has been hard at work rais-
ing the $2,000 minimum donation for their cho-

sen charity: Mercy Corps, an organization that 
provides assistance to poor and rural peasants 
in countries like Mongolia so that they can stay 
economically viable. This includes teaching sus-
tainable farming practices, building schools and 
allowing the community to subsist with the world 
and maintain their traditions. 

“They have pretty low overhead compared to a 
lot of other multinational charities,” Sixth College 
senior Kelly said. “They’re very much focused on 
not doing the classical thing of bad charity to give 
stuff and say, ‘We’re solving the problem,’ but it 
doesn’t help them beyond the usual problem. This 
is a kind of sustainable project that people can try 
to use and continue to use after the charity is no 
longer there.”

According to Natan, a graduate student in biol-
ogy, the team has raised 70 percent of the rally’s

L
urking in the recesses of your backyard lies a thriving, unknown world 
of microbes invisible to the naked eye. 

Examine just three milliliters of soil under a microscope, and you’ll 
most likely encounter oval bacteria with thousands of hair-like strands 

dotting their surfaces, tiny globular amoebas with protruding bulges for arms or seem-
ingly benign viruses with diamond-shaped heads and pencil-straight tails. 

Despite their size, microbes saturate our everyday life in a big way. Without these 
microorganisms — which, among other things, help ferment bread and cheese, treat 
common colds and serve as biofuel — the world would be less than lively. 

All that, when over 99 percent of all microbial species have yet to be scientifically 
classified.

Recognizing the potential of microbes to treat cancer and other diseases, biodiversity 
conservation organization Pro-Natura USA, UCSD’s science student outreach program 
BioBridge and biotech companies BioAtla and Life Technologies formed the nonprofit 
MicroLife Discovery Center last year. 

The center strives to inspire high-school students to take an interest in modern 
science by putting them to work in the biotechnology lab and giving them the job of 
uncovering new microbial species. 

“[The center’s program is] based on BioBlitz, which brings together scientists and 
the general public to do a snapshot of biodiversity in a certain region, normally under a 
24-hour period, looking at flora and fauna,” said Martyn Collins, MicroLife Discovery 
Center executive director and Pro-Natura Americas CEO. “However, it would be a very 
rare event for a BioBlitz [students] like that to discover new species, with the exception 

of microbial organisms. So, the idea is to take students on hunts of microbes.” 
Finding these microbes are the central mission of the center’s new program, 

MicroBlitz. As in BioBlitz, high-school students will pair up in groups and collect 
samples of soil, water and macroorganisms — dead insects and plants — that they 
hypothesize will contain microbes. 

“I feel that there was an excellent chance that I helped discover new organisms,” 
Castle Park High School freshman Jason Wall said. “I’m sure that I discovered at least 
50 [new species] on my MicroBlitz search. We found some really strange places to take 
samples. I tried to look for places with water, some kind of vegetation, soil, and the water 
was not stagnant, but moving kind of slowly.”

Samples can be collected from virtually anywhere, including the school playground 
or a nearby pond.

“[MicroBlitz is] very simple,” Castle Park High School teacher Dari Kimball said. “It’s 
easy to educate those participating in a collection to do it properly: how to keep samples 
sterile so that you aren’t contaminating the sample with foreign bacteria that may not be 
collected. And you can do it within half an hour or less.” 

After students return to the lab, they must perform a few key tests to ensure the 
quality of the sample, such as recording pH, measuring temperature and noting the geo-
graphic location of the original sample. Once their specimens have been collected and 
labeled, they are stored for analysis to determine whether a new microbe was discovered. 

“Although local students will be able to visit the center, that’s not the primary func-

tion,” Collins said. “It’s there to pro-
vide analytical services of finding 
out what’s in their sample and giving 
it back to students. Students may be 
involved in some of the data pro-
cessing from the work that’s been 
done [in the lab].” 

In addition, the center hopes to 
launch a media network online, so 
that students can learn more about 
lab techniques such as DNA recom-
bination and gene sequencing. 

With the help of BioBridge, 
UCSD students and high-school 
students might be able to perform 
the lab tests on their own samples in 
the future — currently not possible 
due to the high cost of materials 
and knowledgeable staff. However, 
UCSD students do have the oppor-
tunity to help implement MicroBlitz 
in high schools.

“[For] undergrad students, 
there’s a lot of opportunity to be 
liaisons within the classroom: the 
training process and working with 
the teachers, putting together media 
and the Web site, helping with spe-
cial events to engage students, con-
sultations on advertising,” BioBridge 
Director Jeremy Babendure said. 

According to Babendure, stu-
dents who discover a new species of 
microbe may also get the opportu-

nity to name the species. Although 
there are naming guidelines to keep 
microboes classfied in an orderly, 
scientific fashion, students would 
have the option of naming their 
microbe after themselves. 

“There might be a naming 
system, where they might be the 
name of the school and the name 
of student, or something like that,” 
Babendure said. “You want to get 
[students] a sense of ownership. 
They might be able to brag about: ‘I 
got to name an organism.’” 

Because it is still in the pilot 
phase, the MicroBlitz center is only 
available to high schools within 
the Sweetwater Union High School 
District. However, based on the pos-
itive reactions and inquiries from 
neighboring schools, MicroBlitz 
hopes to expand nationwide. 

“[MicroBlitz] is not a one-
hit wonder,” Kimball said. “It’s 
something that can be spread out 
throughout the entire year [in the 
biology curriculum], and you can 
bring it back so the students can 
really remember their experiences. 
We can start with the process of 
samples and gene sequencing and 
spread it throughout the entire year.”

▶ MICROBLITZ, MYVT�WHNL��A fter catching up on your roommate’s life through his or her wall posts, Facebook stalking the girl who just loaded scandalous new party 

pictures and updating your status for the third time 
in less than 24 hours, you can now add an application 
to keep yourself amused during lectures — and be a 
part of a new developing music analysis technology 
created by UCSD’s engineering department.

Herd It, an interactive game that allows players 
to rate a song’s danceability, intensity and likeability; 
awards for common answers and the ability to identify 
a song’s title and artist. 

“It’s called ‘Herd It’ because we’re all listening to 
music but we’re also part of this big herd,” said Luke 
Barrington, a Ph.D. student in electrical engineering. 
“We’re listening to these same songs.”

Barrington has been developing the application’s 
technology with Professor Gert Lanckriet of the 
electrical engineering department.

User answers form a data set that will grade, for 
example, the “pleasantness” of a Beach Boys song, and 
will be used to program new technology that will be 
able to define pleasantness on its own by similar wave 
patterns between songs.

After the program is trained to identify musical 
qualities, the data set — made up of thousands of 
songs — will be navigable with a search engine that 
responds to real and descriptive language. 

“If I’m looking for scary Halloween music or if I 
want to listen to some aggressive rap tonight, I can 
type that in and find it,” Lanckriet said. 

Barrington and Lanckriet hope their search engine 
will work faster and more efficiently than similar 
systems offered by Pandora or iTunes Genius, which 

require the user to type in a song title or artist.
In order for the program to recognize which songs 

are “upbeat,” “romantic” or good for “doing chores 
around the house,” it has to be supplied with example 
wave patterns. Lanckriet and Barrington built this 
database by paying UCSD undergraduate students to 
describe 500 songs with adjectives, the way Pandora 
categorizes its music. 

So far, the program contains a limited amount of 
musical knowledge, and is operating on a beta version 
of the search engine. However, the pair’s final goal is 
to retrain the computer with the data collected from 
Facebook’s Herd It to categorize an unlimited amount 
of music.

“The whole motivation for this project has been 
the fact that there are all these independent musicians 
out there,” Lanckriet said. “It’s challenging for these 
independent artists to get their music to access a lot 
of people, and since myself and my students are also 
musicians, we felt that pain.”

The search engine achieves this by providing 
music without artists or song names, which are 
necessary to create a Pandora station. It could also 
become a platform for musicians to broadcast their 
music to the industry, including recording label 
producers, advertising agencies and movie producers.

“For example, I’m making a BMW ad and I’m 
looking for some young, sporty, aggressive driving 
music and I don’t want to pay $20,000 or $200,000 to 
have some well-known band give us a song,” Lanckriet 
said. “What about the guy that has a synthesizer 
sitting in his attic and actually makes some really cool

required donation, which they hope 
to surpass by at least $1,000.

With the help of their largest 
sponsor, UCSD’s own KSDT radio, 
Team Great Job! held a fundraising 
event at the Loft February 6, where 
they hosted local bands and art-
ists and raised approximately $540 
in raffle tickets. The majority of 
their donations have been aquired 
through word of mouth. 

On May 8 at 5 p.m., Team 
Great Job! will be hosting a Thank 
Goodness It’s Friday barbecue 
fundraiser at Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography. All are welcome to 
attend.

As for the road ahead, Natan said 
the team is looking to remain as 
blissfully ignorant as possible. The 
students don’t have a car yet and are 
still trying to decide whether to go 
with a left-hand drive in London or 
buy their car on mainland Europe. 
Beyond looking into phrasebooks 
and a crash course in mechan-
ics (Natan and Kelly cannot drive 

stick), they maintain that the fun is 
in the challenge. 

“I guess it isn’t exactly about 
where it goes,” Natan said. “Honestly, 
before, I never had thought about 
going to Mongolia or Kazakhstan 
or Russia, but then just the idea that 
you’d be part of this greater orga-
nization of the adventurous … It’s 
kind of the phenomena of the cult 
and I want to be part of it.”

“There is a large element of pur-
poseful non planning,” Kelly added. 
“We don’t want to think it out too 
much.”

Too much, Natan said, could 
mean anything from border-cross-
ing failures to car troubles to get-
ting lost in the desolate Russian 
landscape.

“I like the idea that this is kind 
of not so planned, that anything can 
happen, that the whole point that the 
car is going to have to break down at 
some point when we’re going to have 
to deal with it,” he said.

According to the Mongol Rally 
Web site, finishing is hardly the 

ultimate goal.
“It’d be nice if we can get there,” 

said Latham, an environmental 
systems graduate student. “I think 
there’s a 60 to 80 percent success 
rate. I think that’s one of my least 
concerns. I want to do it because it 
will make writing my thesis in the 
fall that much easier. It’s about reca-
librating my mind and body in life, 
considering all the other challenges 
in life — including police, foreign 
places and, you know, the car break-
ing down.”

With this mindset, Team Great 
Job! will set off June 18, possi-
bly to their doom. But consider-
ing the intense research atmosphere 
at UCSD, the team considers the 
Mongol Rally spirit a change for the 
better.

“I think UCSD students need a 
little more adventure, a little more 
variety and a lot more charity,” 
Latham said.

music and is willing to sell it for a 
couple hundred dollars?” 

The goal of the musical-analysis 
program is to connect those looking for 
music with those who have it, he said. 
But an exact business plan for turning 
it into a commodity is still unclear. At 
this time, the engineering department 
is merely exploring a technology based 
on academic research and rooted in 
common interest. 

Lanckriet and Barrington said 
they hope to launch the technol-
ogy to the public this summer, but 
added that their invention will not 
achieve perfection.

“Our experience so far is that 

there is no substitute for a trained 
human ear,” said Tim Westergren, 
the founder of Pandora Radio, to 
VoiceofSanDiego.org.

The successful virtual categoriza-
tion of music wave patterns, accord-
ing to Barrington, also suggests that 
future programs could create music 
with these descriptions woven into 
their database already, regardless of 
whether the song is actually on key 
or subjectively “good.” 

Though Lanckriet and 
Barrington’s invention would poten-
tially give a stage to undiscovered 
talent, it could also expose songs 
under false pretenses.

“It’s a good opportunity for inde-

pendent artists, but at the same 
time, it’s flooding the market,” said 
Kari Francis, a sophomore majoring 
in music at UCSD. “It may be dif-
ficult to differentiate between good 
talent and people who have access to 
the technology. There are so many 
people who have GarageBand and 
all these programs now that make 
producing music really easy. People 
are able to use the computer as a 
tool to manipulate their talents and 
skills in such a way that they may 
not actually be as talented or as 
skilled as what they’re producing.”

homer from junior catcher Kellen Lee.
Senior reliever Ryland McFadyan 

pitched three scoreless frames while 
the Tritons added five runs, including 
Cantele’s record-breaking homer.

“I’m glad that I did it on Senior Day 
in front of my family,” Cantele said. “It’s 
more interesting for the family than for 
me, but it was still a great feeling.”

Buried in a four-run deficit, the 
Broncos stormed back with five runs 
in the sixth inning, hitting a three-run 
bomb to left field to pull ahead 9-8.

Tanner led off the bottom of the 
sixth with a chopper to second, beat-
ing the throw to the bag to get on base. 
Three batters later, the Tritons scored 
on a single from sophomore leftfielder 
Evan Kehoe to tie the score at nine. 

UCSD added two more, taking the 
11-9 win.

The Tritons are still waiting to 
see who they will face in the confer-
ence championships, where they will 
attempt to claim their first tournament 
title since 2005.

turn around their previously hope-
less careers, the Cardinals somehow 
keep on winning with a mediocre rota-
tion that includes Joel Piñeiro, Ryan 
Franklin and Kyle Lohse. With Albert 
Pujols (hee hee, poo holes) in their 
offense, they’ve got enough pop in 
their lineup to make any starter a dou-
ble-digit game winner at the very least. 
Thus, this team’s hot start can’t be dis-
counted as just an early-season streak. 

Overlooked by nearly all experts, 
Cincinnati is on the verge of being 
a legitimate contender. With Edison 
Volquez and Johnny Cueto — the two 
“baby Pedros” — at the top of the 
staff, the Reds are definitely headed 
in the right direction. Joey Votto, Jay 
Bruce and Brandon Phillips would be 
good 3-4-5 options on any team, and 
will hold down the heart of order for 
the Reds. Although Cincinnati looks 
young and powerful, the Reds are not 
ready to contend in 2009. 

Last year looked to be the season the 
Cubs would break their curse, but the 
Dodgers ended that pipe dream very 
quickly, sweeping everyone’s favorite 
losers (aside from the cast of “Rock 
of Love Bus with Bret Michaels”) in 
the NLDS. Chicago’s pitching staff — 
Carlos Zambrano, Rich Harden, Ryan 
Dempster and Ted Lilly — should 
carry the team to another division 
crown. Even if Derek Lee is suck-

ing the life out of fantasy teams, the 
team’s offense is extremely potent with 
Alfonso Soriano, what should soon be 
a healed Aramis Ramirez and Japanese 
import Kosuke Fukudome (hee hee, 
fuk-u-do-me). Kevin Gregg doesn’t 
quite replace Kerry Wood, but look for 
the Cubs to take the division and add a 
fresh crop of bandwagon fans, hoping 
to be a part of the celebration when/if 
the team finally wins it all.

NL West
Probable division winner: Los 

Angeles Dodgers.
Keeping hope alive: San Diego 

Padres.
Don’t let the Padres’ hot start fool 

you. San Diego lacks an offense, and 
despite Jake Peavy and a healthy Chris 
Young, their rotation is just too dull 
to credit. Still, you’ll probably use this 
column as toilet paper anyway, so go 
ahead and pretend that the Padres 
still have a chance — it’ll make those 
all-you-can-eat-buffet seats even more 
exciting. Most Padres fans know or 
care very little about baseball anyway, 
making the Padres the perfect team 
for them while they wait for the next 
Chargers season to start. 

The Rockies traded their best player 
(Matt Holliday) to the A’s for Huston 
Street (bust) and prospect Carlos 
Gonzalez, and are still a few years away 
from competing in the division again. 

The Giants’ starting pitching staff 
does boast three Cy Young winners, 
but two of those three are washed up. 
Yes, Matt Cain is underrated, but Barry 
Zito’s high-school fastball and Randy 
Johnson’s mullet will not win many 
games this year. When your best hitter 
is Bengie Molina — whose man breasts 
bounce violently every time he rounds 
the bases — and you can only throw 
Tim Lincecum out there every fifth 
game before he inevitably blows out his 
arm, you’re in a bit of trouble. 

Arizona still looks solid thanks 
to a strong minor-league system, but 
Brandon Webb is hurt and the team 
is still managed by Bob Melvin, who 
elicits about as much excitement from 
his players as hearing that they’re going 
to have to drive through Tucson — 
because that place sucks balls. 

The Dodgers could easily win 
the division, with a stellar lineup and 
Manny Ramirez still feeling like he has 
something to prove to everyone who 
said he was crazy. Of course, Manny is 
crazy, but he’s also a great player, and 
will make teams regret not signing him 
many times throughout the season. 
Orlando Hudson was a key acquisition 
in an offseason headlined by overrated 
Yankee signings. Chad Billingsly and 
Clayton Kershaw are only getting bet-
ter, and most teams would kill to have 
Jonathan Broxton’s heater and side-
burns closing games for them.

BASEBALL — It was all about the 
senior players last Saturday, who ran 
off Triton Baseball Field for the final 
time with the honor of being UCSD’s 
first California Collegiate Athletic 
Association baseball champions. 

The baseball team, which finished 
second last year and has been a strong 
competitor in the last four postseasons, 
has never before captured the CCAA 
regular-season championship.

“In years past, we were never click-
ing on all cylinders,” Cantele said. “This 
year, when the hitters weren’t doing 
well, the pitchers helped them out, and 
when the pitching struggled, the hit-
ters stepped up. Our team is closer and 
more sound than in the past.”

The seniors made a lasting impres-
sion in their home-game finale. After 
splitting games in Pomona, the No. 5 
Tritons swept a Senior Day double-
header against the Broncos, winning 
the first game 7-3 before pulling out an 
11-9 squeaker in the backend. 

Senior designated hitter Matt 
Cantele blasted his 54th homer to set 
UCSD’s new career home-run record, 
and senior third baseman Josh Tanner 
started a rally in the sixth inning that 
helped clinch the series.

After falling 3-1 at Cal Poly Pomona 

on April 30 in the first of a four-
game home-and-home series with the 
Broncos, the Triton lineup stormed 
back for a 19-5 victory in game two. 

“You have to give credit to [the 
Broncos’] No. 1 starter,” head coach 
Dan O’Brien said of the first-game loss. 
“But, just like we’ve been doing all year, 
we responded.”

Returning home on Saturday for 
the doubleheader, junior Kirby St. John 
took the mound and pitched eight 
innings, giving up three runs — only 

two of them earned — to pick up his 
second season victory.

Cal Poly Pomona scored all its 
runs in the first two innings, putting 
UCSD in a 3-0 hole, before St. John 
shut out the Broncos over the next 
six frames. After the Triton defense 
turned a double play to end the top of 
the third, senior outfielder Nick Burke 
reached first base on an infield hit and 
advanced to second after a single from 
junior shortstop Vance Albitz. 

Tanner then stepped up to the plate 

and drove in both base runners with a 
hard-hit double to the left-field wall.

UCSD added two runs in the 
fourth and sixth innings and one in the 
seventh, finally claiming a 7-3 victory.

The Tritons fell behind early in 
Saturday’s second game as well, find-
ing themselves down 4-0 in the second 
inning. However, they compensateed 
for their struggling pitchers with three 
runs — two of them coming on a 

After witnessing a triple-overtime Boston Celtics and Chicago Bulls game that will 
undoubtedly be entrenched in our 
minds forever — or at least until all the 
excessive drinking and sinning catches 
up with us — it’s a little hard to focus 
on baseball. 

However, while digesting the Bulls-
Celtics series, it’s time to complete the 
division-by-division preview for the 
National League teams as we enter the 
second month of the MLB season.

NL East
Probable division winner: New 

York Mets.
Keeping hope alive: Florida Marlins.
It seems like the Florida Marlins 

become competitive every six years, 
trading all-stars for young talent as 
their front office keeps piecing the 

puzzle together following the disman-
tling of championship teams. 

After a sizzling start to 2009, there 
is no question the Marlins are com-
petitive once again in the NL East. 
They’re putting forward a blueprint 
that, amazingly, other teams refuse to 
follow. The only logical explanation 
for why more teams have not done this 
is they probably feel like following the 
path of a Miami team will cause them 
to contract one of those diseases that 
many people from Miami, or travelers 
to Miami, come down with. You know, 
the burning kind. In your private area. 

Speaking of genital warts, the 
Washington Nationals still suck. 
Adding Adam Dunn to a crappy team 
just means a crappy team featuring 
the all-or-nothing potential of Dunn 
in every at-bat. Dunn’s lazy demeanor 
won’t be a positive influence to prob-
lem prospects like Elijah “Threatened 
His Girlfriend’s Life and Sent Her a 
Picture of the Gun” Dukes and Lastings 
“Already Demoted” Milledge. 

The Atlanta Braves dominated this 
division for over a decade, and — 
even though they’re awful on paper 
— they’ll probably exceed most expec-
tations. Nonetheless, the team lacks 
the depth to remain competitive in 
the East. 

The Mets finally added some big 
arms to the back of the bullpen. With 
J.J. Putz and Francisco Rodriguez man-
ning the eighth and ninth innings, 
count on some early wins — and then 
a little late-season struggle, when the 
New York atmosphere starts to take 
its toll on K-Rod’s already overinflated 
ego. New York’s core lineup looks strong 
again with David Wright, Jose Reyes 
and Carlos Beltran, and Johan Santana 
is an ace who should hopefully keep the 
annoying defending-champion Phillies 
from making another late-season run 
for a postseason spot.

NL Central
Probable division winner: Chicago 

Cubs.
Keeping hope alive: St. Louis 

Cardinals.

TRACK & FIELD — Neither 500 miles on the road 
nor two days of constant rain could slow the UCSD 
women’s track team last weekend.

At the California Collegiate Athletic Association 
Track and Field Championships in Chico, Calif., the 
Tritons held off Cal State Los Angeles to capture their 
fifth straight conference crown. 

The men’s team also performed strongly, finishing 
second to Chico State University, which won its sixth 
consecutive title. 

“The conditions were as bad as I’ve seen in my 
31 years of coaching,” head coach Tony Salerno said. 
“We’re stunned really that an entire team can come 
together that well.” 

On May 1, the first day of competition, All-
American junior Linda Rainwater repeated as the 
heptathlon champion, breaking her own school 
record by recording 5,102 points. 

Sophomore Stephanie LeFever came in second in 
the heptathlon with a personal record of 5,004 points, 
and placed second in the long jump. 

The UCSD women performed equally well while 
on the field. Senior Sarah Hendy and junior Danielle 
Thu took wins in the discus and hammer throw, 
respectively, and junior Marie Archer finished second 
in the hammer throw. 

Junior Fred Cook placed third in the men’s discus 
and hammer throw. 

On the second day, sophomore Kelly Fogarty 
broke her own school record and took the gold in the 
100-meter dash with a time of 11.88 seconds. Fogarty 
also placed second in the 200-meter dash. 

Senior Laiah Blue broke her own school record as 
well, winning the 100-meter hurdles in 13.64 seconds. 

One of the most impressive performances came 
from junior Christine Merrill, who was named the 
women’s MVP for the meet. Aside from winning 
the 400-meter dash and 400-meter hurdles, Merrill 
placed third in the 100-meter hurdles and ran on the 
4x100-meter and 4x400-meter relay teams, both of 
which came in first.

“It seemed like she was constantly warming up 
or cooling down from something,” Salerno said. “We 
thought she had an exceptional meet.”

 Freshman Nick Howe earned CCAA Freshman 
of the Year honors after winning the javelin throw by 
over 20 feet. Senior Scott Tsuda won the triple jump 
and junior Casey Ryan took the high jump.

“We don’t think there are too many things that we 
could have done better as far as how we executed,” 
Salerno said. “We put our people against some of the 
best in Division I and even some elite athletes, and 
being able to do that through the year really showed.”  

Overall, the women’s team won with a score 
of 247.5 points, well above Cal State Los Angeles’ 

second-place 164 points. 
The men’s team finished with 164 points, second 

only to Chico State’s 257 points.
“I don’t get surprised very often as a coach,” said 

Darcy Ahner, who captured her second straight 
CCAA Track and Field Women’s Coach of the Year 
award. “But with the conditions and the rain they 
stepped up to a level that was really phenomenal.”

Both teams will compete again on May 9 at the 
Occidental Invitational, a warmup for nationals.
