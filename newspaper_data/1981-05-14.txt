"I just want to be able to walk to Central

in the new self-defense cia s. 

Alarmed by the threat of rape on thi 
campu, he and twelve other women 
decided to attend the first meeting of a elf

Women's Resource Center.

in defending again t rape and other attacks,

The six week course is taught by two 
in tructors from the County Sheriff' 
Department, in conjunction with Miramar 
College, for a $2 insurance fee. 

"In the e day " - when women are 
atta ked daily throughout the San Diego 
area - "it i especially important for 
women to be aware and to know how to 
defend them elve ," said gt. andy 

trong. 
"We feel the be t' way to protect your elf 

is with natural weapon - hand ,feet, and 
head - thing you alway have with you. 
You may not alway have a can of mace 
handy. " 

Besides, chemical weapons like mace are 
not alway effective, Strong aid , becau ' 
they often backfire on the victim. Not only 
may th attacker seize it for hi ' own u e, 
but a 'udden gu t of wind can ea ily deflect

Treatment of Harris a real farce 

Editor: 
We, the undersigned 

undergraduate students of 
UCSD, would like to express 
our disappointment and 
frustration with the 
deplorable manner in which 
the 1981 AS elections were 
held. It is not our usual role to 
criticize the worth of our 
fellow students; indeed we 
hold no personal grudge with 
any member of the AS. 
Nonetheless, we feel that it is 
imperative that certain 
inconsistencies be brought to 
the attention of the student 
body. 

No doubt by now most 
students are painfully aware 
that the decision of who will 
be our next president had 
been decided not by the 1500 
plus students who voted, but 
rather by a five person 
Judicial Board with a 3-2 
decision. The disqualifica· 
tion of Joshua Harris was 
both completely unpreciden-
ted and uncalled for. 
Throughout the elections 
numerous campaign viola· 
tions have been filed against 
many candidates, virtually 
all of which were more 
serious than those of Harris. 
Yet Harris was the only 
candidate disqualified . 

While we believe that it 
was an error on Harris's part 
to overspend his budget (if 
indeed he did), and it was also 
wrong for him to be tardy in 
turning in financial form s. 
We, nonetheless, find the 
retributive penalty levied 
against Harris far too harsh 
for his campaign violation . 

The Election Commi s-
sion's unsubstantiated claim 
that they had no recourse 
other than disqualification 
for the violations against 
Harris are completely 
untrue. Toby Raymond, a 
candidate for Public 
Relations Director, did not 
turn in his forms until late 
Tuesday. By the time the 
commission discussed the 
violations it was too late to 
suspend his campaign time. 
Yet the Elections commission 
simply issued a warning, 
claiming that a warning was 
significant enough. 

This final decision occured 
behind closed doors between 
Elections Commissioner 
Melissa Ligman and Reggie 

Williams. It should be noted 
that Reggie Williams is the 
person who filed the charges 
against Harris . Since the 
Elections Commission has 
stated that Toby Raymond 
was guilty, why did he get off 
with no penalty at a1l? Is this 
collusion on the part of the 
Elections Commission? 

As students we must 
demand consistency in 
litigation among our peer . 
Why did the Elections 
Commission wait until late 
Tuesday afternoon to 
investigate Harri 's case? 
They knew he had not turned 
in the forms nearly a week 
before, yet they did nothing. 
They should have issued a 
warning then. 

It seems that the Elections 
Commission did not have the 
time to do this. It is really no 
surprise. They did not have 
time to pu blicize the 
Presidential debate. They did 
not have time to police the 
election. In essence, they 
failed to do their job. Instead 
Randy Woodard , a st aff 
member paid to serve the 
students, did much of the 
work of the Elections 
Commission. We appreciate 
Randy' efforts. Indeed , 
without him, the elections 
would have been a greater 
farce than they ended up 
being. Yet the inneptitude 
exhibited by the Elections 
Commission was not only 
exemplified in the ca e of 
Harris. 

Certainly if the entire 1981 
election was scrutinized as 
closely as Harris was, the 
entire election would have 
been overturned. The 
commission broke many of 
its own pristine rules of 
conduct. If they fail to follow 
the same codes the candi-
dates are expected to follow, 
how can we blame candidates 
for being as inconsistant as 
the commission. 

We find the Election 
Commission to have failed in 
the following ways: 

1) Failure to properly 
record write-in votes. 

2) Failure to prevent 
partisan people from staffing 
the polling places. (Pro-Rec 
Center people worked at the 
Scripps polling place.)

week of spring quarter. (Any 
change would have required 
a two· thirds vote of the AS 
Council.) 

9) ..... Failure to allow due 
proce'ss with respect· to Mark 
Massara on violations and 
penalties imposed upon him. 
This point has been verified 
by a unanimous vote of the 
Judicial Board, and Massara 
had to su bsiquently be reo 
tried. 

10) Failure to keep accurate 
records of all Elections Board 
and Judicial Board cases. 

We find the Elections 
Commission to have been 
both extremely inconsistant 
and incompetent. The people 
who now lose are the 

students. Their voice has 
been taken out of this years 
AS election. We believe that 

. either Harris should be 
declared the rightful winner 
of thi& year's presidential 
election or another run·off 
election should be held under 
competent leadership so that 
the students can again decide 
who their president s hould 
be. If this does not occur then 
the AS will only become less 
legitimate in the eyes of the 
students they erve. We can 
then only hone that Jules 
Bagneris is capable of putting 
the piece back together.

Sexual: equality taken too far 
Editor: 

In the letter entitled 
"Sexuality in Turmoil " 
(Guardian, May 7), it was 
said (paraphrasing) how men 
and women must fight 
together for their freedom . 
This was to be taken in the 
context of sexuality. Here we 
are in need of a definition of 
freedom from the author, 
because ultimate "freedom" 
sexually is impossible, for we 
are always trapped into being 
of either one sex or the other 
- at anyone point in time 
(although there are excep-
tions, with apologies to Emil 
Scoffone). So the "freedom" 
for which Ronni B. Light is 
calling is only a matter of 
degree, and in the letter this 
matter was not specified: i.e., 
What was being said? 

The letter in question had 
many things wrong with it-
as do all such matters of 

opinion, including th is one-
but at least it wa an attempt 
to deal with an interesting 
and meaningful issue. One 
good point was made; the 
claim that communication, 
between people and especial-
ly between the sexes, should 
be more open and honest. 

I agree with this, but tell 
me, if someone's being 100% 
honest, how is one to know 
that it is honesty and not a 
pack of lies? And if someone 
appears to be di honest . how 
can one tell that it is not 
indeed straightforward 
honesty? Which is to say, 
"What is honesty and how 
can it be detected or 
measured?" 

And to carry it even 
further, even if one could 
detect and measure the " level 
of honesty" it would not help 
all thai much because, even 
though someone might be 

being honest , it does not 
necessa rily follow that 
they 're telling the truth. For 
example. given someone who 
honestly believes that he! she 
is "X," when in fact he/she is 
not, then we have someone 
who can (when communica· 
ting about her! himself) be 
perfectly honest and yet be 
untruthful. 

To help legitimize this 
claim I call upon the fact that 
we are all changing, growing 
and learning each day, and 
some of said changes occur 
without our being aware of 
them. 

Even though I've been 
critical. I feel the issue of 
liberating the human race 
from itself is an important 
one; even though, as you see, 
arguments and comments 
which make points are quite 
pointless.

The darker side of rock 'n' roll 
BY MAXWELL GLEN 
AND CODY SHEARER 
Washington - No one is 

ready to link the racial 
killings in Atlanta to punk 
rock music. but many critics 
think this music has 
contributed to a resurgence 
of racism among teenagers. 

While there has always 
been a certair.l amount of 
violence associated with rock 
and roll music - lO years ago 
rock groups would some· 
times set fire to their guitars 
during a performance -
some punks bands today 
blow up cars on stage. 

seeks to relieve racial 
tensions. 

•• Some people take the song 
very seriously," said bass 
player Chuck Dukowki. 

"It doesn't say go out and 
kill blacks. But if you feel like 
a white minority , you 
identify with it. We do a big 
service to bring it out in the 
open." 

But how do these tunes go 
over with 14 and IS-year· 
olds? Do they understand the 
half-serious intentions of 
punk rockers? 

members and fans alike. At 
several punk clu bs in Los 
Angeles, "slam dancing" is 
the thing to do. The frenzied 
dancers hurl themselves at 
each other religiously. Near 
brawls develop. Noses are 
frequently broken. One lead 
singer of an LA-based band 
recently had seven bones 
fractured in his face when 
one euphoric fan introduced 
himself with a series of rapid 
punches. 

ing," - said John Carlin, a 
visiting lecturer at Yale 
University who's currently 
teaching a course comparing 
punk rock music to other 
20th-century art forms . 
"These groups tend to think 
they are still revolutionary, 
but they're now really just 
reactionary ... 

Rock has long been accused 
of causing every evil in 
youngsters from poor eating 
habits to epidemics in 
teenage pregnancy. It's an 
understandable assumption. 
Young people don 't travel 
anywhere without rock 
music. It's never too faroH: in 

cars, bedrooms, offices and 
on street corners. Rock music 
is our generation's drive and 
lifeblood. 

For the sake of being 
different. the tired punk rock 
fad may be preying upon the 
weaknesses of young 
America. 

Apart from the appeal of 
being outrageous, punk's 
popularity rests on its ability 
to invoke a helpless despair 
that's shared by many young 
Americans today. They feel 
they have, in the words of one 
punker, "no values, no 
future and few real friends." 

It's the symbols, songs and 
followers of many punk rock 
bands that don't speak well of 
the current rock and roll 
scene. Though the swastika 
was originally used by 
punkers to "parody" racism 
in American , it has become 
the coat of arms for many in 
the movement. Son~ssuchas 
"Master Race Rock, 'perhaps 
written in jest, are now being 
taken seriously by many 
youngsters. 

Apparently not. Youth 
counselors we've talked with 
in Los Angeles and San 
Francisco report that many 
young gangs there have 
embraced the racist affecta-
tions of their punk rock 
heros. 

"There has always been a 
certain amount of violence in 
rock and roll , but the newest 
punk groups aren't even 
trying to make it interest- please turn to page 24 

Listen to the lyrics from a 
song called "White Minority" 
by the band Black Flag: 

Moreover, the new punk 
bands are even more 
outrageous than punk rock 
prototypes such as the 
Ramones and the Sex Pistols. 
Wendy Williams, lead singer 
for the now-popular Plasmat-
ics, was arrested, tried and 
acquitted for performing half 
nude recently in Cleveland. 
William , 31, who sports a 
black-on-blonde Mohawk 
haircut, appeared topless on 
stage wearing only pants, 
shaving cream and some 
strips of electrical tape. She 
was also charged with 
making obscene gestures 
with a sledgehammer. 

"White minority , white 
minority! All the rest gonna 
be the majority! Gonna breed 
inferiority! We al\ gonna

Of course , the band

song see nothing inappropri-

Senate says no to graduate tuition 
continued from page 1 
the same definition as tuition 
used in two lobby sponsored 
bills in the legislature. 

The lobby has sponsored 
the two bills now pending 
which would essentially take 
the power to set tuition from 
the Regents and give it to the 
Legislature by reducing state 
support by the same amount 
tuition would generate. 

Lobby Co-director Paul 
Rogers attempted toconvince 
the subcommittee to adopt 
special language in the 
University's budget for next 
year to prohibit UC officials 
from shifting general fund 
expenditures into student

cuts. 

Rogers aid the language 
was needed to prevent 
another incident such as took 
place in 1978 when t he 
University sifted nearly $6 
million from the education 
fee reserve to fund part of 
UC 's general budget. 

The educational fee fund is 
made up of the $100 each UC 
student pays quarterly. and 
is earmerked or student 
financial aid. The same 
amount is generated from 
registration fees. which is 
supposed to fund trict ly 
student related services at 
the nine campuse . 

UC Budget Director Larry 
Hershman later s aid the 1978 
incident was onl y a one·time 
"emergency" measure after 
the Governor sla hed an 
extra $50 million from the 
University's budget below 
what the Legi lature had 
finally approved. 

UC Vice Pre ident William 
Fretter told the subcommit-
tee it would be "a blow" to the 
University if the Regents 
were not allowed to raise the 
registration and educational 
fees as needed to maintain 
services. 

Fretter said the fees will 
probably have to be increased 
this coming year to hold the

at t he present level. He said 
the fee have not been raised 
from the $100 per quarter 
ince 1971. 
Roger s blames the 

impending education fund 
deficit on the University's 
1978 action of shifting the 
$5.7 million, which he call a 
"riR-off of students." 

, We want to eliminate the 
loop hole the University 
would have if our tuition bills 
pass the Legislature." Rogers 
said, by preventing the 
Regents from raising fees 
which are de ignated for 
student ervices as a 
disguised form of tuition. 

La t week in Washington, 
UC President David Saxon 
affirmed t hat studen t fee 
may be raised thi fall by 12 
to 14 percent, but he 
emphasized that no tuition i 
contemplated in the near 
future.

graduate tuition on Monday.

List of charges against Harris multiplies; Board upholds ruling

the $50 spending limit (he 
had only $5_07 left) but he 
hoped to be awarded budget 
credit for unused fliers 
purchased earlier. 

The next day an AS staff 
person warned Harris that it 
was unlikely Elections 
Commissioner Melissa 
Ligman would award him 
such credit. He then obtained 
a $6 receipt from PIP, which 
he planned to turn in for use 
of only a portion of the 500

convened to decide Harris' 
and Singer's fate. Election 
results had been tabulated 
but not released . 

When the commission 
questioned Harris about the 
new fliers, Singer produced 
the $6 receipt. Skepticism 
was immediately voiced 
concerning the low price 
charged for 500 fliers . Singer 
responded that the slate had 
received "a preferred rate" 
from PIP, where they had 
done business before. 

his disqualification . 
He consulted with a lawyer 

acquaintance last week and 
brought his case before the 
Board on Tuesday . 

At the hearing Harris cited 
the 1977 AS Elections - the 
first AS election after the 
demise of the Student 
Cooperative Union - as a 
precedent that the Judicial 
Board should consider. In 
that election, pre idential 
candidate Steve Grady was 
disqualified for violations 

the nature of his violations. 
"[ reali ze we went over our 

budget, but J know in my 
heart that it had no effect on 
the outcome of the election," 
he said . "There were many 
other options the commission 
could have chosen that wou ld 
have punished me more 
fairly . " 

Harri s believes "justice 
would have been well -
served " had the commission 
barred him from future 
elections. publicly censured 

the elections were poorly run 
this year - ha s been 
mentioned constantly this 
year. Candidates, AS Council 
members, staff people and 
even elections officials 
themselves have criticized 
the Elections Commiss ion on 
numerous counts . 

"[ don 't think the blame 
lies wi th Melissa (Li~man) or 
any individual, ' sai d 
outgoing AS Pres ident Bill 
Topki . " But there were 
major failures in this year's 

The $23 figure on the 
original receipt was later 
changed to $17 by the slate, 
so the total of two receipts 
would equal $23. Harris told 
the Judicial Board Tuesday 
that this was done for 
bookkeeping purposes. 
Regard less of intent, 
tampering with receipts 
violates the Elections Codes. 

The infamous 93 cent overexpenditure was later 
expanded to $20, 40 percent of the total budget 

Harris and Singer, in the 
absence of their campaign 
manager, neglected to turn in 
the receipts and sample fliers 
before posting the new fliers, 
again violating the Elections 
Codes. When AS Commis-
sioner of Student Welfare 
Reggie Williams saw the 
slate's new fliers pOsted on 
May 5, the second day of the 
run-off election, he checked 
Harris' campaign file. He 
found no receipts for the new 
material and only $5.07 
remaining in the Harris 
budget. 

Certain that the candidate 
had overspent, Williams filed 
a violation with the Elections 
Commission. He also charged 
Commissioner of Public 
Relations Toby Raymond for 
not filing receipts before 
posting. 

Later that afternoon , the 
Elections Commission 

Harris later argued that he 
had forgotten about the 
original $23 receipt. 

Suspecting misconduct but 
willing to give the slate the 
benefit of the doubt, the 
Commission merely assessed 
Harris and Sin~er for the H$6 
worth of fliers. ' The $6 was 
subtracted from the $5.07 
remaining in Harris' budget.

overexpenditure_ 

For this - a chars-e made 
with the understandIng that 
they had further overspent-
and for not filing in 
accordance with the election 
codes, Harris and Singer 
were disqualified. 

Harris' appeal to the 
Judicial Board was rejected 3-
2 later that day. 

On May 8, Harris 
submitted a petition for a 
rehearing, arguing that the 
Judicial Board had not 
followed precedents set in 
previous elections, and that 
his violations did not merit

similar to Harris' . but was 
reinstated, suffering no 
penalty. 

The Judicial Board 
dismissed the analogy 
however, noting that Grady 
had not overspent and that 
the Elections Codes have 
been rewritten since then. 

Harris further argued that 
the elections were poorly run 
this year, specifically that 
violators were not dealt with 
consisten tly. 

H e p r.o d u c edt h r e e 
witnesses - candidates 
Mitch Sosna, Pam Gerber 
and Toby Raymond - to 
substantiate this claim. 

While the Judicial Board 
agreed that the elections 
were run poorly , it 
maintained that "no one 
candidate was significantly 
favored and that the election 
was not significantly 
harmed." 

Harris still contends that 
disqualification was too 
severe a punishment given 

hIm or called for a new 
election, substracting his 
over-expenditure from his 
new budget. 

But elections officials hold 
that the violation was 
significant and that the 
candidates deserved disquali -
fication. 

"A 40 percent overexpendi-
ture is pretty major, 
especially considering the 
fact that Josh only beat Jules 
by 28 votes," said Judicial 
Board member Jeremy 
Charlton. 

And although the candi-
dates were not officially 
disqualified for deliberately 
misrepresenting the facts 
about their campaign, 
Elections Commissioner 
Melissa Ligman believes 
much of their conduct was 
done "with the willfull intent 
to mislead the E lections

Failure to properly record 

write-in votes, failure to 
prevent partisan people from 
running polling booths and 
failure to guard against 
double voting were among 
problems he cited . 

The Elections Commission 
also acted without AS 
Council approval, when it 
changed the run-off election 
date to Monday, May 4 from 
the Tuesday , May 5 date its 
own codes specified. A delay 
in ballot printing prevented 
the polls from opening until 
noon on Monday, however, so 
the commission extended the 
run-off through half of 
Tuesday_ 

"If the Elections Commis-
sion felt they could violate 
the codes, how could they 
expect the candidates not 
to?" said Topkis.

blame for the poorly-run 
elections on the AS Council

STUDENTS ORGANID 
TO SAVE 

YOGONUT TREES 
With last week's savage attack fresh in 

their minds, students are intensifying their 
efforts to protect the fabled Yogonut tree. 

Though many students are already 
doing their part by eating Yogonut™ bars, it 
has become apparent to leaders that more 
dramatic action is called for. 

"Yogonut trees are a natural resource. 
We must protect them;' commented one. 
"Never again will a Yogonut tree be harmed:' 
vowed another. 

There is talk of a Yogonut rally where 
the art of eating Yogonut bars, both Apple 
'n Spice and Raspberry Nut, will be demon-
strated . Spirits are expected to be high 
during the occasion.

CHECK IT OUT- ---
The llcp/Mtnt Man: John Hurt and 

Anthony Hopkins star In the story of a 
hideously deformed man living in turn-
of-the-century England. Hurt, acting 
under tons of makeup and padding, 15 
the "elephant man," who t?:)(ists CIS a 
CirCUS freak until a doctor (Hopkins) 
rescues him and tTies to help him to live 
a normal life. This lOOk Into the dar!<, 
viCIOUS side of human nature is one of 
1980's best. The first 15 minutes, in 
particular, are brilliant and hard hitting. 

The CompctHlon: Beautiful classical 
music and inspired performances by 
Richard Dreyfuss and Amy Irving are the 
highlights of thiS schmaltzy lewer story. 
Dreyfuss and Irving cye competitors in a 
prestigious claSSICal plano Competition 
and the two questions of the fil m, 
naturally, are: which one will w in and 
hOlN will they get together? As usual, 
Dreyfuss is arrogant lind conceited and 
somehow loveable. IMng, a nSlng 
young star who deserves more 
attention than she has so far received, is 
at the same time vulnerable and feisty. 
Together, they make the mOllie rise 
abO'v'e the usual run of hack lewe stories 
to become something quite nice. 

The POI"'*' ~ llngl Twlcc: 
Jack Nicholson is elemental and 
VICIOUS JessICa lange is sluttish and 
VICIOUS Together they overcome the 
problems With Incomplete plot that 
plague thiS Bob Rafelson film remake of 
the 4O'yecy-old original. The story Itself 
comes from a novel by James V Cain, 
one of the onglnal hardboiled f iction 
writers, Clnd concerns a dnfter who fal ls 
In lewe With the passionate young Wife 
of an old Greek restaurant owner. 
Together, they plot the old man's 
murder, but fate and their OINn 
Incompetence threaten their plans Too 
bad Rafelson left out such httle thingS as 
the end of the story .. 

OrdIMry "coplc: Robert Redford 
did a masterful job In putting together 
th is film adaptation of the best-seiling 
nDlel about hard times In suburbia. 
MIllY Tyler Moore, a sweetheart In 1V 
land for so long, pl<ryS the bitchy 
mother In a family that starts to 
disinteg-ate foliOlNing the drowning 
death of a favorite son. Donald 
Sutherland IS her sympathetiC husband, 
trying to hold the family together. Both 
are good, but Timothy Hutton, as the 
younger son who blames himself for hiS 
brother's death, and Judd Hirsch, as the 
psychologist who tries to keep Hutton 
from cracking up completely, are the 
best. In all, th is IS a satiSfying, 
emotionally unflinching look at life. 

The LeA Metro: FrancOIS Truffau 's 
latest offering concerns a g-oup of 
actors In Paris during World WCY II, as 
they struggle to keep their plcl'fhouse 
going despite the tensions of the Nazi 
occupation Cctherine Deneuve, classy 
as a Iways, stars as the woman who took 
ewer the theater after her Jewish 
husband went irto hiding, Gerard 
Depardieu, ever-earnest, is an actor 
who eventually leill/es PCII'is for a role In 
the French underground. Once again, 
Truffaut has given us an Indication of his 
lewe for life, for people and for acting 
(be it theater or cinema). With thiS 
ccmbiretlon, hOlN could It miss? 
Answer: ~ doesn't 

Exullbur: People may normal ly 
associate the svvord E~cal ibur and 
Camelct with King Arthur and Lancelot 
(or, perhaps, With Richard Burton), Bu~ 
after they see th iS mOVIe, they should 
automatlcCll1y think of Menln, the 
magician and pOINerbehlnd the throne 
Nicol Williamson, as Merlin, is the touch 
that allOINS John Boorman's flim to rise 
above the crCM'd. Sure, the speCial 
effects are ntce, the battles realistiC, the 
men handsome and vallart, the women 
beautiful - in other words, the 
Arthunan legend brought forth 
accurately - but, Without Merlin, this 
wouldn't be a potential claSSIC. The 
sure test IS In the latter stages of the 
story, when Merlin IS misSing from the 
scene. Things really slow at that point. 
But, thanks to Wlillamson's Merlin, who 
IS at turns mystical, fTightening and 
vulnerable, thiS IS a definite "don't 
miss" mOlle. 

Taa: Nastassia Ki nski, as Tess of the 
D'Urbervilles, is a woman who any 
decent man would give his soul for. 
With dark, expressive eyes and full 
mouth, she is the soul of this mOlie, the 
reason it ultimately succeeds. Of 
cexxse, Roman Polanski - In a radical 
departlXe from his usual type of mOlie 
- does a fine job in bringing the 
Thomas Hardy novel of 1O'v'e anq 
hypocrisy to the screen The rank 
InjustiCes of late 19th century England 
blend we il With the beautiful, enduring 
countryside. But If Klnskl dldn't t?:)(IS~ 
Polanski would helve had to Irlv'ent her. If 
the actress playtng Tess Isn't someone 
the audience can care fOf, no one 
would Sit through thiS three-hour 
retel ling of her travails at the hands of 
lustfu l, heartless men and an uncaring 
society By all means see thiS, the best 
movie of 1980

computer can synthe ize. 
One of the keys to this 
process is understanding 
what make a flute sound 
different from a piano. 

With the progress that has 
been made in this area of 
research, it is now po ible to 
produce a number of sounds 
on the computer. A computer 
can sound exactly like a 
violin and even a string 
quartet. 

Moore points out that this 
is not the ideal use for a 
computer, ince a violinist 

can just as easi ly be hired to 
olay a violin. It is the 
computer' ability to make 
ounds that. could never be 

made on tradi tional instru· 
ments that musicians find 
exciting. 

"When you are creating 
music on a computer, you are 
actually designing the 
in trument," said Moore. 
" You must provide the 
computer with a much more 
precise specification of the 
music you want to hear than

The avant-garde antics of (THE) 
Harkins and Larson 

(THE), wi ll be showing their 
new 1981 performance in the 
Wednesday Evenings At The 
Mandeville Center concert 
eries, May 27, 8pm., UCSD. 

It has been said that "most 
new mu ic is boring ... ," 
whatever else may be true of 
a concert by (THE), it wi ll not 
be boring. But then it wou ld 
be a mistake to put (THE) in a 
classed called "new music" 
or any c1as for that matter. 
This year the charismatic 
composer/performer team of 
trumpeter Ed Harkins and 
baritone Phil Larson will 
take the audience on a 
compelling and kaleidoscopic 
journey through hilariou Iy 
bizarre sat ires, courageou 
and diverse musics and 
electrifying theatrical 
gestures. 

Under tanding intended 
meaning i not a prerequi ite 
for enjoying the often·times 
bizzare antic of the avant· 
garde, musical theatrical duo 
a they offer t heir own brand 
of underground vaudeville of 
brilliant surfaces and 
illustrations. performed with 
the intensity of jazz and rock. 
Harkin and Larson's 
performance virtuosity and 
creativity permeate what 

Harkin and Larson , a.k.a. (THE) 

eem to be sensitively edited 
improvisations. There is an 
ever·present feeling of 
balance on many levels: 
avant·garde. jazz and ro~k; 
traditional and ethnIC; 
abstract and concrete; 
serious and humorous ; 
absurd and meaningful. The 
ingenious pair treat some of 
life's most "angst· ridden " 
issues ith such wit, charm 

and poignancy that they 
become actual celebration . 

Previous (THE) perform· 
ances have received unusual 
accolades such as "the joyful 
gentlemen laid claim to the 
honorary title of America's 
Hope in Anxious Days" 
(Amsterdam , 1977), and 
"they have created works of 
insistent logical content and 
com pell i ng biological 
urgency" (San Diego).

A hort note to ay that 

I'm sad to hearofthedeath 
of reggae arti t Bob 
Marley, dead at the age of 
36, of apparent brain 
cancer. 

Though r ve never been 
a big fan of Marley, nor of 
reggae music in general , 
he did many times give me 
the needed mu s ic al 
re pite. In a business full 
of loud mouth little snits 
yelling "no values, no 
future," effete twerp 
exhuming the corpse of 

ye terday's avant-garde, 
artsy bore e ' pou ing 
either horrible ba tardiza· 
tions of zen or reli 'hing the 
existential moras' a they 
await the immine nt 
decline of the West, not 
to mention the heavy· 
metal knot· heads, Mar-
ley 's mus ic was blessed 
"" ' ith true vis ion and 
conviction with his voice, 
s trong, vibrant, st irrir.;, 
soaring over a pulsating, 
uncluttered rhythm with a 
message of hope, trans· 
cendence and liberation. 

Though I can only 
under tand Marley' s 
politics from a distance 
and hi religion from still 
further, there was in his 
music an elemenf that' 
too rare in American or 
Briti h rock : meaning it. 
Precio u s little mu sic 
comes our way in which 
it s value isn't dependent 
on the success of an image 
or the elaborateness of a 
theory, and the loss of 
Marley means that the air 
will be a tad more polluted. 
This is a loss for everyone.

Wotnen's waterpolo ends 
tnotivating 1981 season 

Success increases participation 
BY JIM AGRONICK 

enior taft Writer 
The UCSD women's 

waterpolo team finished their 
season las t weekend with an 
11· 7 loss to San Diego State in 
the champion hip game of 
the SDSU Tournament. 

Losing to State is nothing 
new for the Tritons who have 
succumbed to their cro -
town ri val s on numerou 
occasions thi s season. 
However, in all fairness to 
UCSD and its three-year 
program, the tate team i 
well-e~ tablished and con i-
dered to be among t he best 
programs in the country. 

The match with SDSU 
proved to be more of a brawl 
than a waterpolo game. 
During this final game, 
several UCSD players were 
injured including goalie 
Nadine Thompson who took 
a hard hot to the face and 
Ann Motekaitas who 
required titches after being 
hit on the follow-through of a 
State player's shot, 

Despite the ten ion in the 
pool, U CSD pI ayed a 
fundamentally ounder game 
than the DSU team. 

According to Claudia 
O'Brien , "the game with 
State was the best of our 
entire eason. If we had one 
more quarter, we could have 
won. " 

Scoring for the Triton 

were O'Brien, Vicky Barker, 
Sandy Groos and Marin 
McDonald. O'Brien al so 
credited teammate Dede 
Steinhoff with the best game 
of her career in the goal. 

In the preliminary rounds 
the Tritons bested Cal State 

" We had a fantastic 
season with 1 000% 
improvement" -
Dan Crane (Coach). 
Fullerton in a nail-biting 6-5 
overtime game. With the 
score at 5-4, a qu ick pass from 
Barker to O'Brien was 
converted to an instant goal 
and a 5-5 tie. Barker was good 
for goal number six which 
won the game and moved 
UCSD into the semi-finals. 

The semi-finals with the 
Univers ity of Arizona lasted 
an entire fi ve minutes before 
an agitated referee forced the 
Arizona team to forfeit the 

game. Down by one goal, the 
Arizona coach voiced hi 
diss atisfaction with the 
officiating one time too many 
and caused hi team to be 
dropped from the playoffs. 

The Triton "B" team had 
its best game of the sea on 
but wa unable to get by any 
of its three opponents. 
Leading the "B" team were 
Jackie van Egmond, Patti 
Herr, and goalie Nadine 
Thomp on. 

In umming up the season, 
Coach Dan Eby commented. 
"We had a fantastic sea on 
with 1000 percent improve-
ment." Coach Dan Crane 
emphasized the large 
increase in participation over 
last year. "We began the 
eason with 18 women and 

we kept all 18," aid Crane. 
Both coaches are hopeful 

that the succe s of this year's 
team will set the foundation 
for a pas ible invitation next 
year to the women's 
waterpolo nationals.

Track and field 
looks to next year 

The Triton tracksters 
crossed the finish line for the 
last time this weekend to 
mark the end of the 1981 
track and field season. 

Both Friday and Saturday 
the men and women 
co mpeted at Cal Poly 
Pomona. In addition to the 
running and field events, 
there was a decathalon which 
lasted from 9 am until late in 
the afternoon Friday. 

The men competed for the 
NAIA Di trict III cham-
pionship , and the women 
competed in the Women's 
Invitational. 

UCSD' women pegged an 
overall fifth in the meet, 
closely behind Point Lorna' 
fourth place finish . The 
'deciding factor was the mile 
relay, in which Pt. Lorna 
passed UCSD in the last leg. 

"The women scored very 
well, showing a promi ing 
building block for the spring 
season in 1982," Coach Andy 
Skief said. "The team is very 
yo ung and looking to 
expand." .. 

The Triton men estab-
lished personal records at the 
Districts and the weekend 
before at Point Lorna, bud did 
not score well in the district 
meet. Coach Skief hoped that 
the "extreme depth that we 
lacked for the entire ea on 
would hopefully be corrected 
in the 1982 season ." 

The Triton coach wa ' 
especially pleased with the 
progre s of Emil Scoffone, 
Emery Mitchell and Tim 
French . 

Scoffone, from northern 
Italy, was a long distance 
runner. He made the switch 
to spr ints and middle 
distance this spring and 
proved to master them 
Scoffone achieved a personal 
record in the 400 meters at 
the di trict meet and at the 
800 meters 'at Point Lorna the 
weekend before. 

Mitchell also improved 
during the season and peaked 
in the 1,500 meters this past 
weekend with a time of 
15:42.46. 

Decathlete French made 
steady improvement during 
his three decathalon events 
for the season. In his last 
competition, he peaked with 
a total score of 5,314 points, 
coming in sixth place for the 
District meet. 

For UCSD's women, 
Vazina Zuniga placed third 
overall in the meet for her 
three field events. The 
weekend before at Point 
Lorna he reached her record 
be ts in all event . Zuniga 
remarked about next year's 
season, ''I'm going to run as 
well a throw next season. I 
can't wait. It'll be a lot offun. 
People don't expect a weight 
per on to run, too."

All right now, enough is enough! For 
years now these pag s ha~'e ingraciously 
com to chronicle the very b t and wor t 
that UC D Intramurals has to offer. We're 
forever listi ng the Top Ten in each spon 
and then lionizi ng their a complishments 
a if they really were the ew York

And then on the other hand, we're n I 
opposed to poking a lillIe fun at all of th e

Believe it or not, Joe Average, thi Bud

Since almost 60% of you fall into that gray 
never·never land called the MIDDLE, your 
devoted campu researcher supreme, 
Budman Carrothers, had decided to pass 
out some equal time to all of you whoaspire 
to finding your niche in the absolute center 
of average and con tant mediocrit y. 

By pushing a combination of buttons in 
his highly sophisticated, Bud Data Bank 
Computer, our lovable blue·caped squirt 
ha come up with an extremely 
disinteresting Ii t of team who thought 
they were headed for en hrinement in the 
Mediocrity Hall of Fame.

The UC Board of Regents, 
decision making body for all 
of the UC, meets today and 
tomorrow to discuss its role 
in the tluclear labs at Los 
Alamos, N.M. and Liver-
more, Ca. 

UCSD students voted 
1,009 to 850 to oppose UC 
ties with the labs, and the 
UC Student Lobby (which 
provided the cartoon at left) 
has made withdrawal from 
the labs one of its top 
priorities. 

BefOre you have your next dark beer, 
have its head examined. 

I B letter yet, do it yoursel~. 
By examining your dark beer's 
color- particularly the head -
you can tell how it was made San Miguel 
dark, By traditional methods. 
Or by short,cut methods, 

How to conduct the examination: 
The first thing to look for is color. True roasted 
barley malt ub tantially darken the entire 
beer. Including the head . Colored syrup, on 
the o ther hand, doesn't it a well at the top. 
You 'll be able to POt the beer not made with 
deep roasted malt : its head will be clo er to 
white, about like in regular beer. 

IIf I you make that test on San Miguel 
Dark, you'll discover a truly dark beer 

with a soft amber head. That's because we 
make our dark beer from deep-roasted 
barley malt. (Barley malt that's been dry, 
roasted slowly and evenly, to allow it to 
darken without scorching or charring.) 
We've been making our dark b er thi way 
since lR90. 

Brand X 

It takes more time than 
adding syrup, but we believe 

it enables us to make a 
better dark beer. 

I N I aturally, roasted barley malt makes 
a difference in the body of the beer, 

too, Try San Miguel Dark and you'll 
experience a deep,roasted aroma and 
flavor. Heartier, richer, and creamier 
than syrup-colored beer could ever be . 

I N low that you've examined the facts, 
we think you 'll prefer a real dark 

beer, If anyone asks why 
you suddenly started 
drinking San Miguel Dark, 
just tell them, you're using 
your head, 

San lJltque!. 
Classic heer ofthe Pac' 

P. Sao MIRucl also makes a de!,clOus 
IIghl lager orne aficIonados c,'cn go 
a 10 m,X if in equal parts with our

Tom Nicholson to tour 
UCSD baseball, basketball veteran 
Former UCSD pitcher and 

current Assistant Baseball 
Coach Tom Nicholson will be 
touring Europe this summer 
as a pitcher for the Athletes 
in Action (AlA) touring 
national ba eball quad. 
Athlete in Action is the 
athletic ministry of Campus 
Crusade for Christ Interna· 
tional. 

Nicholson, a 1980 Econo· 
mics and Biology graduate, 
compiled a four year win· loss 
record of 15-20 and an overall 
ERA or 3.0. For three years 
while at UCSD, Nicholson 
al 0 played a a forward for 
the Triton ba ketball squad 
under Coach Barry Cunning· 
ham, 

Statistic, athletic ability 
and personal recommenda· 
tions were among the criteria 
by which Nichol on was 
selected for the AlA team, Hi 
previous overseas experience 
as a player/ coach of the 
Swedish "Bagarmossen" 
baseball club last summer 
also gave him an edge. This 
summer's tour Gune ]0-
Augu t 2) will once again 
take Nichol on to Sweden, as 
well as Germany, Italy, Spain 
and Holland. 

Nicholson has received 
many awards throughout his 
exten ive athletic career, In 
1979 and 1980 he wa the 

Triton's " Most Valuable 
Pitcher." Nicholson can be 
classified as a "finesse" 
pitcher, relying on the 
fastball, curveball and 
change·up. Opposing teams 
have come to know him as the 
"Cheerleader on themound," 

While at Sanger Hi~h 
School in Sanger, Califorma, 
Nicholson was AIl·League 
Honorable Mention in 
basketball and baseball in 
] 976. Coached by his father, 
head basketball coach at 
Sanger for 25 years, 
Nicholson was named his 
team's " Best Defensive 
Basket ball Palyer" in the 
1975· 76 season. 

More recently, Nicholson 
participated in the UCSD· 
Dartmouth exchange pro· 
gram, spending a quarter 
working out with the 
Dartmouth baseball squad in 
New Hampshire. Since 
September Nicholson has 
been assisting head Coach 
Vince Askey with the Triton 
coaching duties. 

At the same time, 
Nicholson has been working 
as an intern with County 
Supervisor Roger Hedgecock 
a a research advisor and 
as istant on North City West 
i ue, whi h is a propo ed 
community in San Diego's 
North County. 

Track looks to '82 
Lisa John on came to the 

high jump pi t late in the 
sea on, and had not competed 
since high chool. A li ttle 
wary of her ability to peak in 
such a short time, Johnson 
was the leading jumper for 
UCSD this eason and placed 
fifth in the invitational. 

In Johnson's short training 
period, he has improved 
tremendously in both the 
high jump and sprinting and 
has a lot of potential to be 
uncovered in the 1982 season. 

Nancy Lee, UCSD 's 
strongest distance runner, 
transferred spring quarter 
"ready to run ." Lee came in 
fifth In the Invitational and 
this was the third meet for 
her this season. The week 
before at Point Lorna, she 
broke her old personal record 
by ten seconds. Lee 
commented, "[ had been 
trying to break 11:00 for two 
years . It was a barri~r that 
[ had to break in order to 
di cover what I have a a 
runner. " 

Conditions at the Pomona 
campus were hot and smoggy 
- there was a first stage 
mog alert in LA that day -

and unless accustomed to 
running and throwing in 
those condition , perform· 
ance is often hampered .

audience on cable radio. c) Be 
located in San Diego County. 
d) Be affiliated with a 
recognized college or 
university, e) Mu t be able to 
contribute u bstantially to 
the ucce of the DCRA. 
These stipulations were 
determined by a two-third ' 
voteoftheSDCRA' Board of 
Director, which is corn-
pri ed of two repre ntative 
from each tation . 

The la t c1au e wa 

included to prevent tat ions 
for ju t latching on to the 
organization for financial 
gain without doing their 

hare of the work , according 
to Lar on . 

Member tat ion will 
continue to soli it adverti-
sing contra t with local 
uu · ine~ses. However, the 
commercials will be aired by 
all the tation , thu 
providing a larg r Ii tening 
audience for the adverti er. 

The stations will benefit in 
that the income generated 
from the adverti ing 
account will be hared by 
the member tation , with a 
10 percent commi ion going 
to the station which made the 
ale, and five percent going 

into a "dead fund" which will 
be establi hed to protect th 
member in the event that an 
adverti er default on a 
contract.

to generate con iderably 
mor adverti 'ing at 'Iightl y 
higher rat ,being abl to 
point to the DCRA a a 
guarantee that th adverti er 
will be getting a wider
