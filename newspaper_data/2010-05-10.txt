California State University officials 
are developing new methods to push 
undergraduates through the system 
faster, in an effort to make room for 
new students.

Prompted by a significant decrease 
in state funding — which has led the 
CSU Board of Trustees to slash enroll-
ment at each of the university’s 23 
campuses — the new plan aims to free 
up space for incoming freshmen and 
transfer students by making it easier 
for existing students to graduate early.

According to CSU spokesperson 
Erik Fallis, the campuses are using 
academic advising to prevent students 

from switching majors 
— often requiring an 
entirely new set of gen-
eral-education cours-
es, hindering progress 
toward graduation.

In previous years, 
the CSU system 
received $11,075 per 

student from the state, but that figure 
has since dropped to $4,669 per stu-
dent. As a result, the CSU system has 
slashed enrollment by 40,000 students 
since last year.

The enrollment crunch drew offi-
cials’ attention to a large population of 
super seniors — students with more 
than 144 academic credits. There are 
currently around 12,000 super seniors 
throughout the CSU system.

“We’re trying to work on reduc-
ing some of the barriers to student 
graduation, and to help move students 
along,” Fallis said. 

He stressed, however, that the pro-
gram is not meant to push students 
out of the universities — rather, to 
prevent them from wasting time on 
unnecessary classes.

 “We know some students are going 
to take longer than six years,” Fallis said. 
“This isn’t saying that students have 
to graduate within six years, but we’re 
working as much as we can to make it 
possible for students to graduate more 
quickly, and to have a clear road map of 
what they need to do to get a degree.”

According to Fallis, CSU campuses 
have been working to reduce some 
degree programs to 120 units, evaluat-
ing various majors and deciding which 
of their requirements could be waived. 

“Not all of our programs are 120,” 
Fallis said. “There are some that are

Students will continue to feel the effects of the UC budget crisis next year: Every last academic department on campus is bracing 
itself for a 10- to 20- percent cut in funding — and 
a resulting bareboned schedule of classes — for the 
2010-11 academic year. 

“There are going to be a lot more cuts next 
quarter, in terms of less classes being offered,” A.S. 
Campuswide Senator Bryant Pena said. “That’s 
why a lot of students ... when they’re signing up for 
classes, they’re going to have an even harder time.” 

A.S. Campuswide Senator Katie Hall, who sits 
on the UCSD Planning and Budget Committee 
with several administrators, predicted that each 
department will distribute the cuts differently. For 
instance, according to Hall, all non-core laboratory 
classes in the biology department  — as well as class-
es with under 100 students — will be cut completely.

“Each department is structured differently,” she 
said last Wednesday at the student council meeting. 
“The result is that, when you cut from the engineer-
ing department, you cut staff, but when you cut 
from the biology department, you cut classes. Next 
year will look different for each department.”

A.S. Associate Vice President of Academic 
Affairs Jordan Taylor said the way the cuts mani-
fest depends on how each department balances its 
administration, faculty members and classes.

“It’s left up to the departments how to deal with 
the cuts,” he said. “A lot of them with money in 
administration — those divisions will be able to cut 
and consolidate the administrative type of positions, 

The state deficit will hit harder 
than ever Fall Quarter, when 
UCSD’s academic departments 
receive a 10- to 20-percent cut.

Since its grand opening at the beginning of the year, the Village at Torrey Pines transfer housing has had a 
rough time selling itself.

Though Housing, Dining 
and Hospitality was banking on 
transfer-student selling points 
like on-campus convenience 
and granite countertops, the 
Village hasn’t filled nearly 
all its empty mattresses. Of 
the 1,060 beds available, 
approximately 200 are empty, 
according to A.S. Transfer 
Student Senator Adam 
Powers. Powers said the 
main reason transfer stu-
dents aren’t fighting over 
Village apartments is that 
they simply can’t afford 
the rent: between $1,200 
and $1,400 per month.

“I think the price bar-
rier kept a lot of students 
from living there — all 
the transfer students I 
spoke to,” he said. “‘Why 
didn’t you live there?’ 
‘Price.’ I didn’t hear any-
thing other than price.”

As it turns out, 
cost was such a size-
able deterrent for 
transfer students this 
year that HDH has 
lowered prices for all 
units in the Village 
by nearly 9 percent 
for Fall Quarter.

UCSD scientists may be on the 
verge of the couch potato’s Holy Grail: 
a drug with all the benefits of exercise. 

Researchers are attempting to 
develop a pill that prevents obesity by 
increasing metabolic and respiration 
rates. In tests on mice, researchers 
removed FIH — the gene responsible 
for regulating the body’s response to 
low levels of oxygen — during the 
embryonic stage. 

When FIH was removed, research-
ers expected the mice to die as embry-
os, as the enzyme affects developmen-
tal genes. Instead, they acted like they 
were constantly at high altitudes, but 
were otherwise more fit than normal.

“We [removed the gene] think-
ing that the mouse would not survive 
past early embryogenesis, because we 

know [FIH is part of] a very impor-
tant pathway [in controlling response 
to low oxygen],” biology professor 
Randall Johnson said. “But it turned 
out the mouse was born, and was a bit 
healthier in some ways than a normal 
mouse. It is leaner and has less fat than 
a normal mouse.”

Johnson’s lab found that mice with-
out FIH were constantly hyperventilat-
ing — trying to increase their respira-
tion to take in more oxygen — leading 
them to take in 20 to 40 percent more 
air than normal, while demonstrating 
a faster heart rate and drinking 30 to 
40 percent more water. 

Because breathing burns calories, 
the mice developed faster metabo-
lisms, protecting them from obesity.

The genetically altered mice had 
high insulin sensitivity, which reduces 
blood sugar and protects against 
weight gain induced by high-fat diets, 

and stayed lean. They were also small-
er than the normal mice, since weight 
gain had been inhibited since birth.

However, the mice without the FIH 
gene experienced the same  side effects 
that are associated with “altitude sick-
ness,” or the result of moving quickly 
from low to high altitudes: hyperventi-
lation, higher heart rates and anemia.

Johnson said that a drug could be 
developed to suppress FIH in order 
to treat obesity and diabetes for those 
who cannot exercise.

“There are people who are in such 
bad shape that they may need some 
drug to help them [in addition to] eat-
ing less and exercising more,” Johnson 
said. “Of course, changing lifestyles is a 
very important thing, but some people 
need immediate help. That’s one of the 
reasons why these drugs can be useful.”

The lab is investigating whether 
known chemical compounds that also 

inhibit FIH have similar effects.
For humans, just triggering the 

body’s response to low oxygen levels 
may not prevent diabetes or obesity. 
The researchers will first have to dis-
cover the specific amount of oxygen 
needed in order to metabolize food.

more than that, for various reasons. 
But for the most part, we’re looking to 
have 120 units be the general require-
ment for a bachelor’s degree.”

Fallis added that each campus will 
determine its own numeric targets for 
increased graduation rates. 

“The range is anything from pre-
paring students before they get into 
university through early start and EAP, 
to greater advising when they are stu-
dents to urging students who have 
much more units than they need in 
order to complete a bachelor’s pro-
gram,” Fallis said. “[We’ll be] advising 
those students on what major on what 
they want to complete and then help-

ing them completely it in timely.”
CSU Northridge has taken the most 

extreme route, pulling federal aid for 
students with over 150 credits, accord-
ing to the Chronicle of Higher Education.

UC Office of the President spokes-
person Lynn Tierney said the UC 
system is facing many of the same 
problems as the CSU system.

“With the state in such a terrible 
financial economic crisis, it’s very hard 
for the CSU system to absorb stu-
dents,” Tierney said. “The whole state 
— community colleges, state colleges 
and University of California — they’re 
trying to absorb as many people as 
possible, so that they can get as many 
people in and educated as possible.”

She added that similar changes 
could be implemented within the UC 
system. The UC Board of Regents 
recently began reviewing a proposal to 
establish a three-year pathway, which 
might allow eligible students to waive 
certain general-education courses.

“When you’re in an economic cri-
sis like this, nothing is off the table,” 
Tierney said. “We’re looking at every-
thing. If we’re going to make a deci-
sion, [it] is going to be made much 
more based on the quality of the edu-
cation we can deliver than the time we 
can deliver it in.”

and not necessarily affect classes. There 
are other divisions that tend to add 
classes over adding more administra-
tion, and those are the divisions that 
will have to cut classes.”

UCSD spokesperson Christine 
Clark said the total number of classes 
cut for Fall Quarter 2010 cannot yet be 
determined. 

“It is too soon to tell how many 
classes will be cut and what impact that 
will have for fall, since there are many 
changes that will happen between now 
and September,” Clark said. 

An e-mail sent to all biology majors 
in mid-March said that some courses 
traditionally offered multiple times 
throughout the year will only be taught 
once in 2010-11, while others will not 
be offered at all. 

Bioengineering majors with a bio-
technology concentration were notified 
by e-mail on May 6 that two required 
classes now have a time conflict, because 
a separate section had been cancelled. 
For students to stay on track within the 
concentration, according to the e-mail, 
they must now deviate from the pre-

scribed graduation track by making 
course substitutions or leaving more 
difficult courses for quarters to come.

However, according to Associate 
Dean of Education Gabriele 
Weinhausen, the shrinking variety of 
biology classes will not affect gradu-
ation rates. 

“We are teaching all required cours-
es, and we are offering multiple sec-
tions of all required courses,” she said. 
“The ability of students to make aca-
demic progress and to graduate in four 
years is not affected.” 

The bioengineering department is 
allowing students to enroll in a substi-
tution class — one discontinued several 
years ago — for Fall Quarter only.

“Everyone is buckling down to pre-
pare for what could happen,” Hall said. 
“The departments are being told to 
anticipate a 10-percent cut, but be pre-
pared for a 20-percent cut.”

UCSD already saw major course 
reductions this year. A.S. Social 
Sciences Senator Irfan Ahmed cited 
a report released by the Academic 
Senate in January, which detailed that 
course availability in 2009-10 had been 

reduced by 3.7 percent — or about 52 
classes — since the year before. 

“The administration is looking at 
a $20 million base reduction in bud-
get,” Ahmed said. “This could go to 
another $35 million, depending on 
the economy. And — combined with 
faculty retirement plans, pensions and 
bundle services — it could go up to 
$80 million.”

Ahmed said he noticed an increas-
ing number of professors are giving one 
midterm per quarter instead of two, 
though he admitted there was no hard 
evidence to back his observations. 

“Before, classes would have two 
midterms and one final,” he said. “Now 
what’s been happening is a one-mid-
term, one-final policy. You save money 
from paying TAs and from paying 
graders.” 

The decrease in class offerings is 
coupled with an increasing student-to-
faculty ratio at UCSD. In the past four 
years, the ratio rose from 29.39-to-1 in 
2006 to 31.17-to-1 in 2010.

It’s the next step in the evolution 
of cell-phone technology: a poten-
tially life-prolonging microchip, 
compatible with any mobile phone, 
that alerts users to the presence of 
harmful chemicals in the air around 
them. 

As part of a Department of 
Homeland Security project called 
“Cell-All,” the chip is being devel-
oped by a UCSD research group 
led by chemistry professor Michael 
Sailor, in conjunction with optics 
company Rhevision Technology. 
According to DHS Director Stephen 
Dennis, the program aims to turn 
an average cell phone into a portable 
chemical-detection device. 

The chip samples the surround-
ing air for dangerous chemical 
compounds such as carbon dioxide, 
formaldehyde and propane.

“We had a breakthrough about 
a year ago to make these [sensors] 
specific to chemicals,” Sailor said. 
“Putting sensors on people is pro-
tecting the public health.” 

Sailor said the technology was 
inspired by beetle shells, whose iri-
descent layers mimic the layers of 
silicon covered in light reflectors that 
make up the chips.

When airborne chemical mol-
ecules come into contact with 
the chip, the molecules bind and 
interfere with the light reflectors. 
Certain reflection patterns set off 
sensors that will then identify the 
compound.

Rhevision is supplying Sailor’s 
research team with an optical lens 
that monitors the nanosensors in 
the chip. When a sensor goes off, 

the lens detects which exact sensor 
it was, so the user will know which 
particular chemical is present in the 
surrounding air.  

“When the chip detects a com-
pound, the color changes to alert the 
user,” Sailor said. 

At first detection, the chip will 
alert the owner to the presence and 
type of chemical via text message or 
cellular call. DHS plans to build a 
centralized emergency monitoring 
facility which will receive air sample 
analysis and location data from 
each remote chip when dangerous 
chemicals are detected. (For privacy 
reasons, users will be able to opt out 
of being tracked by the facility.)

Dennis said he hopes that up to 
80 prototypes of the chip — which 
he predicted will cost $1 each — will 
be developed by the end of 2011 to 
accommodate different models of 
cell phones.

However, the release plan is still 
in its early stages. In order to place 
the product on the public market, 
the chip must prove to be consis-
tently accurate, without triggering 
false alarms that the user might learn 
to ignore. So far, to ensure that the 
sensor is reliable, the lab has con-
ducted sensitivity tests by pumping 
gases over the chip and recording 
how often it responded to various 
chemicals. Sailor said he thinks the 
chip is infallible.

“Our biggest advantage with our 
sensor is it doesn’t foul,” Sailor said.

The team is currently working to 
improve the sensitivity of the chip, as 
well as widen the range of airborne 
chemicals it can detect.

“ If they are done, they should give up their spot and move on.”ELIZABETH ADAMSASSOCIATE DEAN, CSU NORTHRIDGE COLLEGE OF HUMANITIES

+,*+(5�('8&$7,21�³ As a way to combat 
California’s ever-shrinking budget, beginning in the 
2010-11 academic year, on a campus-by-campus 
basis (including CSU Northridge and Cal State East 
Bay) several California State University campuses are 
about to shrink their population of super seniors still 
nursing their degrees. 

It’s a legitimate pressure, considering the schools 
are under heavy admissions cuts and need to free up 
some space for other CSU hopefuls. But the measure 
chips at one of the most admirable fundamentals 
of the American university: that students be given 
an extension of time to find themselves and make 
sure they end up living a life that capitalizes on their 
strengths. 

The new plan attempts to limit the number of  
students with 144 credits or more by forcing them 
to file for graduation. More distressingly, students 
will lose all state and federal financial aid if they go 
over 150 credit hours — meaning all of the 433,000 
current CSU students with over 160 units would lose 
their aid. For many, that means dropping out.

One can only keep his fingers crossed that the 
CSU plan doesn’t inspire a similar crackdown on the 
University of California campuses.

It’s also no mystery why many undergraduates are 
hesitant to leave behind the comforts of waking up 
after 2 p.m. and wearing sweats all day to brave the 
real world, especially when the job market is so hope-
less. In 2007, 51 percent of college graduates were able 

to find a job within six months of graduation; in 2009 
only 19.7 percent of graduates could do so. Despite 
fifth- and sixth-year seniors’ “slacker image,” many 
are extending their college experience because they 
decide to pick up an additional major or minor, or 
decided to change their major late in the game.

$11,075 per student from the state, but the California 
budget crisis has reduced funding to only $4,669 per

the CSU system has already slashed enrollment by 
40,000 students.

A Shove in the Wrong Direction
 By Margaret Yau����Contributing Writer

ILLUSTRATIONS BY SARAH ARAKAKI/GUARDIAN

After this weekend, I have been shaken by a delayed realization on the condition 
of our generation. It is one which, I 
must confess, saddens me to state in 
such sweeping, unequivocal terms, 
but which nevertheless must be 
done: Despite all Lady Gaga- and 
Whole Foods-engendered delusions 
of worldly grandeur, we are not a 
sophisticated kind. Not even a little.  

When, on May 1, No. 15 
Magazine — a new student publica-
tion designed to “provoke thought 
and spark inspiration through the 
multifaceted world of fashion” — 
hosted a party on campus for its first 
issue, it wasn’t intended as another 
student-org event replete with con-
struction-paper banners and Costco 
pizza. On the contrary, this was to be 
a high-class soiree — the type with 
cocktail napkins, plastic wine flutes 
filled with Martinelli’s (the student-
org Cristal substitute of choice) and 
vaguely bourgie hors d’oeuvres like 
sushi and cupcakes. 

Held on the top floor of the 
Village transfer-housing tower — the 
next best thing to an on-campus 
penthouse — the event even claimed 
to boast an exclusive VIP list. All 
this, mind you, in the name of 
sophistication. (And — my bad — 
the multifaceted world of fashion.)

While I personally could not 
be torn from my frozen dinner to 
make it all the way to that distant 
15th floor, I’ve gathered from sec-
ondhand accounts and awkwardly 
incriminating photos (here’s to you, 
King Gupta), that what resulted 
wasn’t so much a grand gathering of 
fashionable sophisticates as a small 
congregation of American Apparel-
clad freshmen, who had apparently 
pregamed with just enough Popov to 
make the night remotely fun.  

Of course, No. 15 Magazine isn’t 
the only guilty one. Just last night, in 
fact, I attended a high-class potluck 
named the “pretentious party.” The 
night began with admirable inten-
tions, as several of my friends and I 
left the house in our bow-tied best, 
complete with fragrant cheese plat-
ters and no fewer than five flavors of 
champagne. We danced to obscure 
music produced well before we were 
born. The host even committed to a 
razor-thin detective mustache.  

By the time the clock struck 1 a.m., 
though, not only had my companion 
and I — doing our best “Gossip Girl” 
imitation — gotten lost on the bus; we 
had clogged the toilet, obtained stains 
on our sophisticated ensembles and 
been evicted from the hot tub by “the 
head” of the home owner’s association. 
Apparently, Mr. Bustamante could not 
relate to our thoroughly cosmopolitan 
desire to hop the pool fence and go 
swimming in our underwear.

At the end of the day, though, 
who can really blame us for our 
cheap attempts at sophistication? On 
a campus whose ritziest indulgence 
comes in the form of a lukewarm $8 
plate of mac ‘n’ cheese from Zanzibar 
Cafe, it’s no wonder that some of 
us wish to pretend — if only with a 
three-minute waltz or $5 bottle of 
champagne — that the finer things 
are well within reach.

Dear Editor,
The divestment resolution that 

the A.S. Council has discussed in 
meetings for the past two weeks 
called for the University of California 
to liquidate its holdings of “any 
United States companies materially 
supporting or profiting from occupa-
tion and human rights violations.” It 
specifically mentioned Israel’s activi-
ties in the West Bank and Gaza. The 
resolution made no specific mention 
of firms that deal with the dozens 
of countries whose human rights 
records are, by many accounts, far 
worse than those of Israel — includ-
ing many of Israel’s sworn past and 
present enemies. 

Divestment resolutions wind 
up in the courts all the time. Such 
resolutions are often challenged, 
and sometimes struck down, on the 
grounds that conducting foreign 
policy is not the business of a state 
government’s investment fund, or 
that the state’s money is for purposes 
other than a political statement by a 
particular group seeking to impose 
its views on a diverse community and 
administration. A possible outcome 
of enacting the proposed resolution 
would be to force the UC system into 
a costly legal battle at a time of severe 
financial strain. 

The divestment resolution repre-
sented nothing more than a costly, 

one-sided demonstration that is prac-
tically guaranteed not to bring about 
any worthwhile result. Furthermore, 
the proposed divestment resolution is 
counterproductive even to the goals 
of the bill’s vocal backers, Students 
for Justice in Palestine. 

No one should lose sight of the 
reality that the proposed UC divest-
ment is not likely to change the 
behavior of any firm, government or 
other entity. All we would accomplish 
by selling off those equity holdings 
is a forfeit of our shareholder influ-
ence, and a transfer of it — possibly 
at a deflated price. In other words, 
the UC system would lose any ability 
to influence the management of the 
firms in question, while at the same 
time, it would create a quick profit 
opportunity for some other party 
that is not caught up in our political 
debate. 

The main argument set forth by 
South Africa divestment proponents 
in the 1980s was that, through a 
broad-based divestment campaign, 
Western financiers could drain the 
capital resources of firms that con-
ducted business in South Africa. 
Those firms would in turn pressure 
the South African government into 
ending apartheid so the capital sanc-
tions could be removed. 

Unless the UC divestment were 
somehow augmented with more seri-
ous capital market sanctions from 
Washington (which won’t happen, 
as our foreign policymakers have a 
different attitude toward the Middle 

East conflict than the extremists 
behind this resolution), the financing 
abilities and business prospects of the 
firms in question won’t be affected. 

The SJP-backed resolution specifi-
cally targets firms that conduct busi-
ness with Israel in relation to its self-
defense. Selling our already issued GE 
stock, for example, is most unlikely to 
compel GE to ask the Israeli govern-
ment to halt their businesses. 

The divestment resolution was 
an attempt at appropriation of uni-
versity funds by a vocal subset of 
students intent on making a symbolic 
statement on a divisive, emotionally 
charged issue. That is not an appro-
priate use of a public university’s 
resources — or its good name.

Dear Editor,
Another Sun God Festival is upon 

us! The 28th year of the festival will 
take place on Friday, May 14. The 
event has continued to grow both in 
attendance and festivities with more 
food, games and entertainment than 
ever before. This is truly a day to 
spend with friends as the school year 
comes to an end. We hope that all of 
our efforts will make for a fun yet safe 
experience for all of UCSD. 

Everyone is encouraged to enjoy 
the festival, but please keep a few 

things in mind:
1) A zero-tolerance policy will 

be in effect, and all UCSD Police, 
Resident Advisors, Residential Security 
Officers and resident deans are strictly 
enforcing all policies and laws. 

2) Free water will be available for 
all attendees who bring a reusable, 
non-glass, empty water bottle to the 
festival. Stay hydrated!

3) Any visibly intoxicated person 
will be denied entrance to the event, 
and may be detained by the police.

4) Please be respectful of neighbor-
ing residents and university staff, espe-
cially around the Marshall Field Box 
Office, on Thursday and Friday.

5) Your cooperation in following 
all UCSD policies and remaining in 
control of your use of alcohol will 
minimize many potential problems 
during the event. Please watch over 
your friends, as well as yourself.

Sun God 2010 is here — have a 
great time, UCSD!

THE RIVETER By Ronnie Steinitz

would want their laggers to just gradu-
ate already. 

But, if we zoom out, the CSU sys-
tem is making itself into a robotic boot 
camp, mechanizing the university to 
the point of becoming a degree fac-
tory — not a place that fosters creativ-
ity and risky pursuits in the name of 
happiness. A liberal-arts pathway that 
stresses the final degree — not the 
work it takes to get there — is seri-
ously overlooking the purpose of exist-
ing in the first place as an alternative 
to more technical schools. 

Luckily, according to UCSD 
spokesperson Christine Clark, the new 
CSU policy won’t be adopted by UC 
campuses. Instead of kicking super 

seniors out, they are cutting enroll-
ment of incoming freshmen in the UC 
system by 1,500 students every year. 

While this blow to accessibility 
should not be taken lightly, there’s 
a certain level of quality that must 
be maintained for those who are 
accepted. As tenured professors are 
swapped out for underpaid lecturers 
and TAs, and over-enrolled class offer-
ings are slashed to only the necessities, 
it’s no wonder unsatisfied students are 
currently staying for an average of 4.3 
years. UC administrators would be 
wise to prioritize the education of its 
current students before turning to the 
extreme CSU proposal, should it arise 
as a possible solution.

In the meantime, the CSU system 
could begin with a lesser evil: prohibit-

ing students to declare a second major 
or change their major by the time 
they’ve reached 130 credits. This policy 
would allow students ample time to 
find the right major, at the same time 
ensuring that students who are strug-
gling because they just don’t want to 
grow up aren’t abusing a failing system.

Cutting off financial aid entirely 
to students who haven’t quite landed 
in their niche is a roundabout way to 
boot lower-income stragglers out of 
the system to make room for a new 
round of freshmen with plump college 
funds. Public education was designed 
to ensure that Californians be pro-
vided the tools to get what they want 
out of life and make the world a better 
place — and sometimes, that can take 
more than four years.

On May 3, the U.S. Supreme Court brushed aside contestations over 
the long-disputed patch of land in 
Balboa Park leased to the Boy Scouts 
of America — with a hefty discount. 
Given that the park is public property, 
detractors argued, the constitutional 
ban on government preference for reli-
gious groups prohibits the park from 
leasing its land to the organization at a 
reduced rate; to go against that ban is 
to compromise free speech. 

The crux of the Boy Scout contro-
versy is centered around the religious 
bias of the organization. However, 
even though the Boy Scouts histori-
cally are a Christian organization, they 
claim to have no theology, nor a 
position for or against any particular 
religion. 

What’s more, a report drafted in 
2008 by the Balboa Park Committee 
states that the park may lease facilities 
to any “cultural institution” for “little 
or no rent” that will prove a benefit 
to the community — and it’s not only 
the Boy Scouts who benefit from this 
policy, which disproves any claims of 
religious preference. 

Yes, continuing to force scouts to 
recite their “duty to God” at meet-
ings does reinforce a certain religious 
preference. And that probably won’t 
change in the immediate future. But 
it’s important to realize that almost 
every interest group is biased one 
way or the other — so the only 
way that the city government 
could remain unbiased is to provide 
land to the organizations who need 
it most — as all can agree a wilder-
ness training program might. 

—Cheryl Hori
Associate Opinion Editor

In 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that, because Boy Scouts of 
America is a private organization, 
it can legally discriminate based on 
sexual orientation. 

Boy Scouts has a long history of 
excluding atheists and agnostics as 
well. Two of the largest sponsors of the 
Boy Scouts are the Church of Latter 
Day Saints and the Catholic Church. 
Given these affiliations, it is clear that 
the organization has a religious agenda. 
And while the park committee’s 2008 
report stipulates that discounted land 
may be granted to organizations that 
benefit the city, one that discriminates 
against many community members 
can hardly be considered beneficial. 

The city of San Diego has allowed 
Boy Scouts to lease city parklands for 
just $2,500 per year. By granting the 
Boy Scouts discounted rent, the city 
of San Diego is supporting what is 
clearly a discriminatory organization. 
Gays, lesbians, atheists and agnostics 
all pay taxes to the city to support 
those parklands. Allowing the Boy 
Scouts to use this land — practically 
for free — is an insult to San Diego 

residents.
As long as Boy 

Scouts of America 
remains an orga-
nization with a 
religious bias, 
it should not 

be supported by a 
government that is 
legally obligated to 
remain secular.

Closing in on the one-year mark, the Village at Torrey Pines
transfer housing is combing out the kinks, wrestling down rates and

gearing up for the next round of renters right around the bend.

According to HDH Director Mark Cunningham, after working with the 
student advisory committee, the department decided it would lower rent 
at the Village by spreading the debt racked up during its construction 
across all undergraduate housing. In other words, prices for all UCSD 
undergrads went up slightly so that the cost of living at the Village could 
go down about 9 percent. 

Lauren Klibingat, an Eleanor Roosevelt College first-year transfer cur-
rently living in Building 8, said she first moved to Village after spending 
some time as a commuter.

SUN GOD ISSUE

I wanted to live on campus — which was a really 
smart move,” Klibingat said. “I really recom-
mend for transfer students to come here for one 
year and then move off campus.”

A few weeks before school started, Klibingat 
said she noticed that transfer students planning 
to live in the Village were getting to know each 
other through Facebook. Eager to join their 
community, she signed a lease to live in a double 
room.

But when HDH couldn’t find Klibingat a 
roommate to share the double, they offered her 
the room for a price slightly higher than that of a 
single. Klibingat said she would never have been 
able to afford the room without the help of her 
parents.

“The room that I have is a double converted 
into a single, so its $1,450 [a month] — and I 
think a regular single that’s meant for one person 
is about $1,300,” she said. “It’s not too much of a 
difference, but still. They said nothing else was 
available — that they were all full, and that was 
the only thing they had.”

Klibingat, like the majority of her neighbors, 
is moving off-campus next year with friends she 
met at the Village, where she said she’ll be paying 
$600 a month, plus utilities.

Klibingat’s apartment at the Village isn’t 
unique: Many other residents are currently living 
in creative housing arrangements — some with 
missing roommates, and an even larger swath 
alongside non-transfer students allowed to live at 
the Village to fill the extra beds.

HDH began accepting non-transfer stu-
dents almost as soon as the Village opened 
its doors last Fall Quarter. According to 
Cunningham, it’s a common problem for new 
transfer-housing complexes: This coming aca-
demic year, the take-rate for the Village is 38% 
percent of eligible transfer students, which is 
higher than most other complexes within the 
UC system. But because of this, the Village 
will most likely need to fill itself with junior 
and senior undergraduates again next year — 
something that, according to Cunningham, 
was indeed anticipated during the Village’s 
planning process. 

Despite generally luxurious accommodations, 
common complaints among Village students 
this year included the absence of a common 
lounge, window screens and parking spaces. 

Open windows brought in bugs and drafts, and 
without a common lounge, some students felt 
they had nowhere to congregate or plan large 
events. However — thanks, in part, to the stu-
dent organization Villagers Initiating Progress, 
or VIP — Buildings Two through Eight were 
finally outfitted with screens last month. (As its 
windows weren’t designed for screens, Building 
One — the tower — will see them glued in this 
summer.) In addition, the unused bus stop in 
front of the Village marketplace was converted 
into a few 20-minute loading zones.

“In the beginning, we didn’t 
have such a programming focus,” 
VIP co-director and ERC first-year 
transfer Robin Kim said. “We also 
worked with administrators to try 
a get a common lounge like the 
other colleges do — still haven’t 
gotten that figured out yet.” 

It was around Week Three that 
Kim said he first noticed a poster 
asking students interested in 
student government to come to a 
meeting being held by the Village 
Resident Dean Terra Bailey and 
Assistant Resident Deans Susan 
Berry and Andrea Melrose. 
Shortly thereafter, the Office of 
Residence Life asked the group 
of interested students to create a 
council of sorts to represent the 
Village population. Elections were 
held, and Kim was elected director of internal 
affairs.

Kim himself happens to be quite the Village 
cheerleader: “It’s been pretty darn awesome,” he 
said. He and the other nine consistent VIP mem-
bers currently put most of their efforts toward 
planning events like the welcome-back dance 
and movie nights. However, when it first began, 
then-co-director and ERC first-year transfer 
Daniel Yuan said the council was more focused 
on improving problems within the complex.

“It’s not a bad organization, but I don’t think 
it’s realized its full potential,” Yuan said. “It needs 
guidance from someone who knows about the 
bureaucracy.”

Although he had only just transferred to 
UCSD, Yuan said he said he quickly noticed the 
obstacles preventing the Village from improving. 
Other colleges, he said, don’t want the Village to 

serve as housing for a seventh college, which is 
why it doesn’t have a legitimate college council 
or representation on the A.S. Council (although 
there is an A.S. transfer senator). Yuan said he 
would recommend a split between those inter-
ested in putting on events and those focused on 
transfer-student and residential advocacy.

Yuan added that the sterile Village atmo-
sphere detracts from the area’s sense of commu-
nity. Because students are not allowed to put up 
posters or fliers along railings or inside windows 
— as undergraduates often do in their dorms 

— Yuan said he believes Village 
administrators are priding van-
ity over practicality. It’s a problem 
that A.S. Transfer Senator Powers 
encountered as well, when he first 
tried to reach out to his constituents 
living at the Village. 

“You can’t flyer all over there 
like you can at any other colleges,” 
Powers said. “They’re really proud 
of their new buildings, as they 
should be. So it took some time to 
figure out the right channels to go 
through.”

The Village was recently 
equipped with a community board 
on which to put up fliers. However, 
according to Yuan, superficial 
restrictions like these are just the tip 
of the iceberg. Having worked with 
Village administrators during Fall 

and Winter Quarters, Yuan said he recognized 
that HDH has been working hard to fulfill stu-
dent requests — but, he said, the department still 
has a long way to go. 

“I realize that things such as parking can be 
a long process, but that’s why you should finish 
phase one before you start on phase two,” Yuan 
said, referring to the upcoming opening of the 
Village’s second half.  

The other half — a 10-story tower and four 
low-rise complexes, under construction across 
the street, and currently ahead of schedule — is 
set to open Fall Quarter 2011. The complex will 
include 800 more beds, along with a dining facil-
ity and common lounge.

Revelle College first-year transfer Tim 
Richardson said he hasn’t been too pleased with 
the resounding noise of construction across the 
street.

“I had four roommates, and within the sec-
ond day, two of them moved out because of con-
struction — because we’re right here in the tower 
facing the construction,” Richardson said. “So as 
soon as the sun comes up, they’re out there.”

Other residents have also struggled to adjust 
to the strict presence of security officers in the 
Village. Because many Villagers are over 21, 
and many others lived off-campus while attend-
ing community colleges before transferring to 
UCSD, mandatory quiet hours and Residential 
Security Officers (RSOs) seem a suffocating 
price to pay for their on-campus locale.

“If you’ve lived off-campus before, you’d 
know it wasn’t like this,” said Sixth College 
first-year transfer James Pillow, who lives with 
Richardson on the 14th floor of Building One. 
“You know how it is having a place, and you 
know what’s offensive to the people around you. 
You know your neighbors, and you know which 
ones complain — and here, really, it’s not the 
neighbors who complain, but the RSOs doing 
their rounds.”

According to Building One Community 
Coordinator and Revelle College third-year 
Marisa Llamas — an undergraduate non-transfer 
living in the Village — because transfer resi-
dents are used to complete independence, they 
can find the crackdown on partying infringing. 
However, compared to her experience as a fresh-
man in the Revelle dorms, Llamas said she finds 
Village regulations to be a breath of fresh air.

“I feel like there’s a little bit more of a sense of 
freedom over here,” Llamas said. “When I was at 
Revelle, RSOs would walk though our suites — 
and here, they only walk through the hallways. 
Obviously parties still get broken up, but its still 
a more mature situation.”

All residents interviewed said they planned 
to live off campus next year, mostly due to the 
high cost of rent. And yet, despite their criti-
cisms, they all said they were glad they made the 
decision to live on campus. 

“I think that, here at UCSD, we don’t have 
that many new things — so it’s kind of odd 
for us to see something so new,” Powers said. 
“Everything that’s been here has been here for 40 
years, so considering all that, it’s done incredibly 
well.”

INFOCUS ART IN ACTION

Last Friday, inspired students from across campus came together for the Art in Action festival to demonstrate against discrimina-
tion and prejudice. The festival was organized 
by the UCSD theater department. Though it was 
largely in reaction to the “Compton Cookout” , 
according to a member of the vetting committee, 
Gabriel Lawrence, it functioned as an independent 
celebration of unique backgrounds, diversity and 
heritage. 

Surges of support came from all over campus 
— some professors even cancelled classes and 
offered extra credit.  Participating students got 
the word out through a variety of media, includ-
ing signage in support of LGBT and civil rights, a 
live mural creation, spoken-word performances 
—    even a dance party all held at Mandell Weiss 
Theatre.  

Lawrence estimates that roughly 300 students 
were in attendance by the end of the evening. 

“One of my goals was to have conversations 
with people across campus about diversity,” 
Lawrence said. “Regardless of the numbers, to 
have meaningful conversations like that and know 
that people were inspired and had a change of 
heart — that makes the event a success.”

SALON BOHEME

SITESEEN T hough it may be cursed with a pretentious name, there’s nothing remotely ostentatious about Salon Boheme. Unlike other hair salons in Banker’s Hill, 
there’s no hipster soundtrack to the quiet din of faucets 
and clippers, no avant-garde magazines gracing the 
waiting-room table — just the idle chatter of Boheme 
founder Gregory Pearson and the latest headlines from 
Us Weekly and Marie Claire. 

Decorum takes a backseat to reasonably priced, qual-
ity hairstyling at Salon Boheme. It 
isn’t unheard of that Pearson — a 
notorious perfectionist — stay past 
10 p.m. on a Friday night to ensure 
his last client leaves satisfied. That 
kind of dedication can have its 
downsides, though: It’s equally com-
mon to wait up to 30 minutes into 
your appointment slot, so make sure 
you’ve got at least an hour to spare 
before stopping by. 

Because Boheme just opened its 
doors this February, the salon hasn’t 
yet developed a steady stream of 
foot traffic, so walk-ins are usually 
accommodated.

If you can forgive the delay, the salon’s atmosphere is far 
more relaxed than the local Supercuts. Seeing as it is a smaller 
operation, only four barber chairs are necessary — one or two 
of which are typically vacant.

Men’s haircuts go for $30 and women’s for $45 — a little on 
the pricier side. But you get what you pay for. Pearson’s com-
mitment to haircutting — which, he says, grew from his desire 
for a creative outlet in college — shows in his precise cuts. He 
does, however, recognize that not every college student has the 
trust fund to bankroll a pricey trim, and is running a series of 
promotions to make his services more affordable. With a refer-
ral, haircuts are currently half-off (tell him the Guardian sent 
you), and all hair-coloring appointments include a free cut. 

For those who don’t mind a 15-minute walk through down-
town, getting to the salon is a cinch on the UCSD Medical 
Center, Hillcrest shuttle, which runs Monday through Friday 
until about 9 p.m. For those less willing to trek the last leg of 
the trip from the shuttle stop, MTS Bus Route 3 can pick you 
up near the shuttle stop and drop you off just a block from the 

salon. Either way, Pearson can guarantee 
you’ll re-enter the La Jolla bubble a satis-
fied, freshly shorn customer.

distance events. With the second-
to-last running event out of the way, 
the host Tritons trailed by less than 
nine points. All they needed was 
to win the 4x4 — collecting all 10 
points awarded to the winner — and 
hope that Chico State would come 
in eighth place, giving them a single 
point.

The entire Chico and UCSD 
squads gathered along the side of 
the track to cheer on their relay 
teams. The Triton team was stacked 
with some of the conference’s top 
talent: Sophomore Jaqueline Rose 
would run the first leg, followed by 
juniors Kelly Fogarty and Stephanie 
LeFever, and anchored by senior 
Christine Merrill. Chico’s team was 
not as impressive: two freshmen, 
and a season-best time nearly 10 
seconds slower than that of UCSD.

The noise from both crowds 
grew louder in the final moments 
before the gun went off, each try-
ing to outdo the other in volume. 
Finally, the starting official’s voice 
came through the loudspeaker:

“Runners, to your marks.”
The chants grew even louder as 

the runners took their final stretches 
and lowered themselves into the 
blocks.

“Set.”
Silence. The stadium held its 

breath as the starter raised the gun 
above his head.

Crack.
The runners exploded off the 

blocks with the sound of the gun, 
and the cheers re-emerged, loud as 
ever. Cal State Los Angeles jumped 
out to an early lead, but UCSD’s 
Rose kept it close, coming in just 
behind Cal State Los Angeles’ 
Brittany Manuel. Rose handed the 
baton to Fogarty, who was unable to 
close the gap for the first 200 meters 
of her leg of the race.

Fogarty had already won three 
conference championships on 

Saturday: she took both the 100- 
and 200-meter races, and ran on 
the victorious 4x100-meter relay 
team. While her achievements were 
undeniably impressive, questions 
began to crop up in the minds of the 
Triton squad. Does she have enough 
fuel left in the tank? She doesn’t 
normally run the 400 — can she run 
that far? Is this the end?

With about 150 meters left in her 
leg of the race, Fogarty answered 
those questions decisively. She 
suddenly exploded as if shot from 
a cannon, passing Cal State Los 
Angeles’ Moriah Jobrey like she was 
standing still and handing the baton 
to LeFever with the lead. 

“I couldn’t get her on the inside 
of the track so I had to go around 
her,” Fogarty said. “At that point, I 
knew that if I went around her, I was 
going to have to kick it into gear.” 

The Golden Eagles, however, 
would not give up so easily. LeFever 
lost the lead in the handoff and 
battled for the top spot throughout 
her 400-meter stretch. As a heptath-
lete, she was in her 12th event over 
a three-day stretch — an astounding 
feat. Nonetheless, LeFever showed 
both her versatility and endurance 
by handing the baton to Merrill 
only a step behind Cal State Los 
Angeles. 

Merrill ran behind the Golden 
Eagles’ Jennifer Shoate for the first 
half of her leg, once again raising 
questions about the Tritons’ chances.

Similar to Fogarty, Merrill had 
already won four events that day, 
including a victory in the 400-meter 
race, where she recorded the second 
fastest time in school history. She 
was without doubt the best choice 
for the anchor leg, but how much 
did she have left in her?

Once again, all questions were 
answered. Merrill passed Shoate 
with just under 200 meters left in 
the race and never looked back. 
UCSD finished with a time of 

3:45.27, a three-second improve-
ment on its season best. Cal State 
Los Angeles finished three seconds 
back at 3:48.21.

When the race was over, how-
ever, the Tritons were not the ones 
celebrating. Chico’s relay team fin-
ished eight seconds back at 3:53.27 
— almost an afterthought in such 
an exciting race — but it was good 
for fifth place, and four points in the 
overall standings.

Chico had won the CCAA 
women’s championship, ending 
UCSD’s bid for a sixth consecutive 
title. Yet the Triton relay team still 
stood triumphantly at the podium, 
receiving a loud ovation from their 
teammates, who had gathered at the 
edge of the track. 

The Tritons may have just missed 
the cut, but they certainly made it 
exciting.

But Loyola Marymount’s offense did 
not let up, matching UCSD’s four goals 
to nurse an 11-7 lead heading into the 
final quarter.

The Tritons outscored the Lions 
3-2 in the final period, but the early 
deficit was too much to overcome, and 
Loyola Marymount finished with a 
13-10 victory.

With their seasons on the line, the 
two teams engaged in an aggressive 
face-off, combining for 21 exclusions 
and three five-meter penalty shots. 

Bloom led the Tritons with four 
scores in the first three quarters, and 
Crowell scored another three. Lions 
junior driver Mary Ann Campos led 
the opposing team with four goals. 

Following their second straight 
conference title — their eighth in the 
past 10 seasons — the Lions advanced 
to the NCAA Championships, and will 
face off against No. 4 UCLA on May 
14. The Tritons brought their final 
overall record for the season to 18-19.

As the No. 2 seed in the tourna-
ment, the Tritons were pitted against 
seventh-seeded Sonoma State on April 
30. UCSD quickly fell behind 3-1 in 
the first quarter, but stormed back with 
five goals in the second period, out-
scoring the Seawolves 5-1. Crowell and 

junior utility Coles both scored goals 
in the last two minutes of the half, giv-
ing the Tritons a 6-4 lead.

UCSD maintained control in the 
second half, scoring the first three 
goals after the break and taking a 9-4 
advantage late in the third. The Tritons 
held on in the last quarter for the 
10-7 win that advanced them to the 
semifinal game against Colorado State 
University. 

In the semifinal, the Tritons put 
up five spots on the scoreboard in the 
second and fourth quarters. Senior 
goalkeeper Markayla Quane set the 
UCSD single-season saves record, pro-
pelling the team to its first WWPA 
Championship game in six seasons. 

Heinrich said that despite UCSD’s 
struggles earlier this year, the program 
is in a strong place going forward.

“This year has been a huge step 
for this program,” Heinrich said. “We 
had a new coaching staff and nobody 
expected us to do as well as we did, but 
we knew where we wanted to be. We 
went from being fourth in conference 
and not ranked to ranked in top 20 and 
runner up in conference. It’s a good 
place for the program to be.”

TRACK & FIELD  — UCSD’s track-and-field 
stars walked onto their home field May 6 
ready to sweep the 2010 California Collegiate 
Athletic Association Championships. Turns 
out, so did Chico State.

The Triton squad came in second place 
on both the men’s and women’s sides at the 
conference championships last week. UCSD 
hosted the meet and won 15 events, but it was 
Chico who came out on top by definitively 
sweeping both divisions.

The Triton women came up just short in 
their bid for a sixth consecutive conference 
title, losing it by less than three points: UCSD 
ended with 209.5 points, second only to 
Chico’s total of 212.33. Cal State Los Angeles 
finished third with 101.33 points, while San 
Francisco State finished fourth.

The fate of the women’s title came down 
to a thrilling 4x400 relay — the final event 
of the meet — but the Tritons were unable to 
prevent Chico’s conference win.

“To get at that many conference champi-
ons and not win the meet is incredible,” wom-
en’s coach Darcy Ahner said. “It’s a tough one 
to swallow, but I’m so proud of how the team 
competed, it’s hard to be sad about it.”

The women had 12 event wins at the 
meet. Senior Christine Merrill was named 
Athlete of the Meet for the second straight 

year, after winning a total of five events 
throughout the day: the 100- and 400-meter 
hurdles, the 400-meter race and the 4x100 
and 4x400 relay teams. Her time of 54.76 
seconds in the 400-meter is the best in school 
history.

Junior Kelly Fogarty joined Merrill on 
both relay teams, and individually won both 
the 100- and 200-meter dashes. Yet nei-
ther could compete with the versatile junior 
Stephanie LeFever, who competed in no less 
than 12 events over the three-day meet. 
LeFever won the heptathlon and long jump 
on Friday, then won the triple jump and saw 
victory as part of the 4x400 relay team on 
Saturday. 

Fogarty’s 200-meter time of 23.97 seconds 
improved on her own school record; It was 
also the first time she had broken the 24-sec-
ond mark.

“I’ve been working very hard to get down 
to the 23s,” Fogarty said. “So it was very nice 
to actually do it.” 

Senior Linda Rainwater battled injury to 
win the high jump with a mark of 5’7.25” — 
making her the reigning national champion 
in the event. 

However despite star efforts of the Triton 
athletes, Chico’s deep, solid roster proved too 
much to overcome, as team members were 

often able to pick up points even if they did 
not win the event.

“We didn’t have as much depth going 
into this meet as we’ve had in years past,” 
Ahner said. “We put together a phenomenal 
meet, but we just did not have the depth.”

On the men’s side, Chico quickly ran away 
with the meet, totaling 290.5 points to earn its 
seventh straight CCAA title. The Triton men 
finished with 140 points, just ahead of Cal 
Poly Pomona’s 130. 

Senior Leon Baham was the star of the 
day, winning both the 110- and 400-meter 
hurdles. 

“What can I say? The guy just lines up 
and races,” men’s coach Tony Salerno said. 
“It’s really a warrior mentality needed for the 
hurdle events, and he’s got that.”

Sophomore Nick Howe picked up his sec-
ond consecutive conference title in the javelin 
throw: His mark of 208’6” bested his closest 
competitor by over 15 feet. 

The Tritons will compete in the Cal State 
Los Angeles Last Chance Qualifier Meet 
on May 15, and will travel to the national 
Division-II Championships two weeks later 
in Charlotte, NC.

CCAA CHAMPIONSHIPS

WOMEN’S WATER POLO — Facing off against the Lions 
in a highly anticipated conference championship matchup, 
the No. 18 Tritons fell to No. 8 Loyola Marymount University 
13-10 on May 2, officially ending their 2010 campaign.

UCSD advanced to the Western Water Polo Association 
conference final after defeating Sonoma State University and 
Colorado State University at the conference tournament in 
Bakersfield from April 30 to May 2. 

“From the beginning of the season, our goal was to get to 
the championship game,” senior captain Stephanie Heinrich 
said. “Obviously we wanted to win too, but we had to put in 
all the hard work just to get there.”

The Lions and the Tritons last battled on Feb. 20 — a 
game that Loyola Marymount dominated, winning 10-4 
against the then unranked UCSD women. 

Now boasting a perfect WWPA record, the Lions entered 
the final game as the favorite after defeating Cal State San 
Bernardino and Cal State Bakersfield. 

UCSD scored first, sending the Lions into their first defi-
cit of the tournament. However, Loyola Marymount quickly 
turned around, netting three scores within one period to 
finish the quarter with a 3-2 advantage.

The second quarter proved to be treacherous for the 
Tritons. Unable to contain a persistent offensive attack from 
the Lions, UCSD was outscored 4-1 in the period — and 
Loyola Marymount had taken a commanding 7-3 lead by 
halftime. 

Led by two goals from senior attacker Audra Bloom, the 
Tritons swarmed back into the game in the third quarter, 
using scores from sophomore attacker Jessica Tran and 
junior attacker Hanalei Crowell to outdo their first-half total.

The announcer provided the information everyone in the stadium had felt coming:
“We have results from all but one 

event, and it looks like the women’s 
championship will indeed come 
down to the 4x4.”

The track and field women’s 
conference championship would be 
determined by one race: the 4x400 

meter relay. Chico State held a slight 
lead over UCSD after dominating 
the 5,000-meter race — an event 
that reaffirmed Chico’s right grip 
on the conference, especially in the
