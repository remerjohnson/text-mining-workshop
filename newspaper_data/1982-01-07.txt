The challenge of 
being gay at UCSD 

By PEGGY IYES 
taU Writer 

LAGO. Lesbian and Gay 
Organization at UCSD. 
Featuring hard·core militant 
fe minist and blatantly 
effeminate males. 

Or so I thought .... 
Expecting to come face· to-

face with one of those militant 
females , I approached the 
LAGO office with apprehen-
sion before my meeting with 
Chris Alvarez, spokesperson 
for the campus organization. 

But upon my arrival , I 
experienced a shock similar to 
that of reaching for t he carton 
of ice cream, only to find that 
my roommate had fini shed it 
off the night before - because 
Chris Alvarez was not the 
militant that I was expecting. 

Being a native Kansan 
(we're noted for our ignorance 
of the res t of the world), I guess 
I wa expecting t he "Super-
woman " image in black 
leather and chains. But this, 
Chris Alvarez was not. 

Chris Alvarez is, by no 
means, "hard-core. " he is a 
friendly , sensitive person who 
i willing to hare her 
knowledge about the gay 
community with those on the 
"outside. " 

Chris says that LAGO is 
trying to dis pel many of the old 
tereotypes about lesbians and 

gays. There was one rumor 
around campu that the group 
was dominated by "a bunch of 
militants, " but after speaking 
with some of the member , I 
found this to be fa l e. 

LAGO is the former GSU 
(Gay Student Union) which 
wa thouRht to be discrimin-

ate of lesbians, thus , the new 
title. 
. "A lot of lesbians do not 
relate to the word 'gay: 
therefore, we lesbians were 
oppressed by our invisibility 
on campus," Alvarez noted. 

The group boasts of "a 
collective group" of Ie bians, 
gays and some "straight" 
people, according to Steve 
Brady, an intern wit h t he 
Counseling and Psychological 
Services at UCSD who also 
has an interest in the gay 
community. 

"I think it is real important 
for a group of disfranchise-
ment to have a ense of 
community," Brady stated. He 
senses the need for gays and 
Ie bian to affiliate in order to 
avoid the po ible feelings of 
alienat ion. 

Howard Leo nard was 
another counselor wi th the C 
& P Service who wa 
in trumental in forming one of 
the firs t Male Alternative 
Sexuality Support Groups on 
campu . John White, now a 
pos itive pokes person for 
LAGO, was originally involved 
in this group before "coming 
out of the clo et " on campus. 

"I was very afraid to 
express my sexuality in the 
dorm . I was very 'clo eted.' 
Through the Support Group, I 
accepted my own sexuality 
and I became involved in 
LAGO," White stated. 

"UCSD can bea particularly 
difficult campu to be gay at , 
even through , by con ervate 
e timate , gay make up more 
than ten percent of t he 

po pulat ion ," ay LAGO 
sources. 

" We mak e o ur s el v e s 
open ... so that people will 
dispel their stereotypes about 
us. We're really 'normal' 
stereotypes. Our exuality is 
only one part of u ," said 
Wh ite. 

White and Alvarez bot h fee l 
that LAGO i an important 
organization for the UCSD gay 
co mmuni ty because it 
provides a " en e of fa mily." 

"Our bigge t need is that of 
per onal upport , which i 
something the organ ization 
provides," White .stated . 

T he o rgan izatio n has 
dwindled in and out of 
ex is tence on t h e UCS D 
campu , due to the trengths 
a nd wea kn e es of its 
leadersh ip. The pa t two 
years, however, have been the 
st rongest for LAGO, helping 
over 100 part ici pants accept 
and be prou d of t h e ir 
sexuality. 

"The fact that we exist i a 
political statement, because of 
what we repre ent amon&. 
student organization ," White 
said. 

"We believe we have the 
right to exis t openly ," tated 
Alvarez. 

LAGO has been trymg to 
include a representative trom 
the Ie bian and gay tudent 
population on the tudent 
Affirmative Action ommit-
tee. Even UCSD Chancellor 
Richard Atkin on ha told 
White that he i in principl(' in 

favor of including the group. 
"The student groups aren't 

inviting us, bu t the admini-
tration is tremendously 
upportive," White said. 

White recent ly attended the 
Lesbian and Gay Student 
Leader Conference at UCLA 
w hi ch included several 
representatives from colleges 
and univer itie throughout 
t he Southern California area 
(a fir t for the network). There 
White learned that UC anta 
Barbara and UCLA both had 
repre en tatives on their 
respective Committees and 
both al 0 included nondi crim-
in a te clau e in their 
u niveri ty policie . White feel 
that if UCSD could al 0 adapt 
this repre entation, it would 
be a trendsetter for the re t of 
the UC campuse . 

" We basically have to rely 
on our elve (as a group). We 
don 't have the channel the 
other tudent organizations 
have. Without the individual 
commitment to the group, it 
wou ld collapse," White 
remark d. 

LAGO receives funding 
from the A (A ociated 

tudent) budget, but not 
nearly the $12,500 granted to 
the Committee for World 
Democracy, which ha" been 
under attack 10 t he recent 
pre . La t yea r , LAG O 
received 975 in funding; thi 
year they have, at pre ent, 
received $1,100. The e monie 
help u pport no n· e i t 
dance , pot-luck dinn.er and 

get-together , mformative 
lectures and general operating 
expenses incurred by the 
group. 

"A large part of our task 
consists of educating the 
campus community ... and 
destroying tereotype about 
Ie iban and gay, which 
hape many people's interac-

tion. The e kmd of behaviors 
and attitude contribute to the 
de truction of gay people," 
LAGO ources cite. 

White and Alvarez both 
dealth with a number of 
commonly a ked question 
regardmg tho e attitude 
toward homo exuality, uch 
a ,"Do gay men hate women 
and do all Ie bian~ hate men?" 

"In general, that certainly 
i n't a problem here. We work 
together, we don't have any 
problem ," Alvarez tated. 

" I don 't hate men, I love 
women. A far a friend hip ,I 
don't care what ex they are," 

he added. 
"Another tandard que -

tion," Chri laughed, Hi • 'how 
do gay have ex?' - and I 
an wer, 'exactly the arne way

What doe it mean for me to

putting on my gay clothes, and 
getting into my gay car!"

Civic illiteracy 
For most unaergraduates 

"current events" would seem 
confined to an upcoming 
basketball tournament or final 
exams. 

Such matters as the opening 
round of US·Soviet arms 
discussions in Geneva or the 
next budget showdown in 
Congress would draw blank 
stares at most colleges. 

"Civil illiteracy" threatens 
our democracy like never 
before, warn Ernest Boyer and 
Fred M. Hechinger in a new 
report for the Carnegie 
Foundation for the Advance· 
ment of Teaching. And the 
blame can't be placed solely at 
students' feet: Educators and 
the media aren't helping to 
foster good citizens. 

"Unless we find better ways 
to educate ourselves as 
citizens," Boyer and Hechin· 
ger write, "we run the risk of 
drifting unwittingly into a 
new kind of Dark Age - a time 
when small cad res of 
s peciali sts will co n t r ol 
knowledge and thus control 
the decision· making process. 

"These high priests of 
technology will understand, or 
claim to understand, the 
complicated issues, telling us 
what we should believe and 
how we should act . In this new 
age of growing confusions, 
citizens would make critical 

The Bottom Line 

decisions not on the basis or 
what they know, but on the 
basis of blind faith in one or 
another set of professed 
experts." 

Of course, mediocre voter 
turnouts and chronic distrust 
of public institutions have 
been questioned , debated and 
bemoaned in an endless 
number of books and 
broadcasts. 

But , as Boyer and Hechinger 
note, colleges have seemed 
either unwilling or unable to 
counter this dangerous 
indifference. On the contrary, 
faculties have tended to shy 
from discussion of con traver· 
sial issues and to rely instead 
on s implified, accepted 
prescriptions to complex 
questions. In an increasingly 
unpredictable world, they 
have helped institutionalize 
predictability.

N ew wave ice cream vendors 
By Randel McGill 

It seems that there have been a few changes 
rece:1tly in the ice cream vendors who roam our local 
st reets . First off, they no longer use white trucks, 
rather they've opted for more spiffy vehicles such as 
recondi tioned muscle cars from the sixties or li ttle 
Toyotas with big back tires. Secondly, they seem 
much younger than they used to be; that is, the e 
new vendors aren 't usually much older than sixteen. 
Thirdly, they don 't have any ice cream to sell ; I 
asked one young businessman the other day if he 
had any ice cream and he just tared blankly as if I 
had said something completely inappropriate to our 
meeting. And probably the mo·t noticeable of all the 
changes is the new style of music which they have 
adopted and the increased volume with which they 
play th is' music. It used to be tha t they played a little 
jingle which was useful for informing the people 
within hearing di tance that an ice cream vendor 
wa approaching, but now this jingle has become a 
rock song or radio com mercial blasted out on 
powerful speakers. 

Now don 't get me wrong, r have nothing against 
rock mu sic · I rather enjoy it most of the time · but I 
don 't like the idea of ice cream vendors going around 
attracting attention for no apparent reason. This 
frustrates me terribly; not only doe it make me mad 

that they 're always out of ice cream, but I can't 
imagine why they care to continue on with business 
as usual in the absence of a product to sell. 

I might attribute this to their apparent lack of 
experience in the business world; after all, as I said, 
they are only sixteen or so. But judging from the 
response I got from one young entrepreneur when I 
informed him that it was bad business to go on 
cailing for more customers without anything to sell , 
I'd say that they really don 't seem to care too much 
about business. 

Another new development in this booming 
industry is the advent of s tationary ice cream 
dealers. A dealer will deal right out of hi s house 
instead of bothering with the nui sance of a moving 
di spensary. They still have all the same drawbacks 
as their more mobile comrade . They still play loud 
rock music and they are s till always out of ice cream . 
But dealing ou t of the hou e is far more convenient 
for the dealer. 

The other day r got a hunger for an ice cream bar. l 
could hear that my neighbor was operat ing ' I could 
hear hi s music · and so r decided to stroll the two 
blocks to his house to get some ice cream. 

Of course he was out of ice cream and so I asked 
him , "Why are you playi ng your mu ic 0 loud 
th n?" 

He scratched his head and gave me a quizzical 
look . I decided to level with him for obvious reason . 
I asked him if he wouldn't mind turning down hi 
music so that I could have some quiet back at my 
house. I made sure that he realized that I lived two 
blocks away. 

He said, "you mean you can hear this from two 
blocks away?" 

"Yes ." 
"But you can't hear it very well can you? I mean it 

can 't be very loud." 
"No, it's not what you'd call loud . but it i 

annoying. " 
I shouldn't have used the word annoying but it 

was too late. He seemed not to understand exactly so 
I tried to clarify why it bothered me. 

I said , "haven't you even been annoyed by a fl y 
buzzing in a room when you were trying to go to 
sleep or read a book?" 

I wasn 't ure if thi was a good example s ince he 
might take me to be insulting hi s taste in music. I 
was preparing for the wor t : an angry protest or a 
coff for being overly en itive or even a fi erce blo , 

to orne valuable portion of my anatomy. 
In tead, he a ked, "you mean, fli s buzz?"

Clean Air Act: cheaper in the long run 
By ROBERT WOLCOTT 

Pacific News Service 
The Clean Air Act , the 

monumental centerpiece of a 
host of environmental laws 
enacted a decade ago, is on 
center s tage. Its fate is in the 
hand of a Congress torn 
between strong public support 
for renewal of the act a nd 
administration efforts to 
reduce environmental regula· 
tionn in the name of economic 
growth. 

The administration's 
rationale for significant 
revision of the Clean Air Act of 
1970 is perfectly in keeping 
with it overall assault on 
government regul ation of 
business activity in general. 
The theory holds that by 
freei ng business from ma.ny of 
the cumbersome and expen· 
sive regu latory requirement s, 
business wi ll be able to invest 
more capital in production of 
conventional consumer good . 
This ultimately wi ll lead to 
more job, stable prices and 
economic healt h. 

T he fl aw in this widely held 
theory is the failure to 
consider the economic benefit 
derived from such untraded 
but valuable "goods" as clean 
air , visibility and human 
health. The fact is, these 
intangible "products" may 
co ntribut e as much to 
economic pro perity as a ri se 
in auto sales or a reprieve for 
the sink ing s teel industry. 

Evidence of the economic 
benefits of clean air i

plentiful. For insta nce, metals, 
paints and other building 
materials hold upsignificantly 
longer in clean air than in 
polluted air. Agricul tural and 
forest products naturall y 
thrive in a clean environment. 
And labor productivity itself is 
enhanced demons trably by a 
healthy work force. 

However , the signi ficant 
con tribution of these factors to 
economic health are not fully 
recorded in the gross national 
product. Consequently, in the 
clamor for regulatory relief 
and the pursuit of market 
growth targets. these values 
often slip through the analytic 
crack. 

Admittedly, it i difficult to 
measure the economic gains 
achieved by clean air . 
Nonetheless, many studies 
have been done and much of 
this work has beensy nthe· 
sized by Prof. Myrick Freeman 
of Bowdoin College in Maine. 
He estimates that the Clean 
Air Act has contributed $21.4 
billion annually (in '78 dollars) 
to the national economy. 
Freeman 's estimate may well 
be on the conservative ide, for 
it deals on ly with the benefit 
resu lt ing from the control of 
two pollutants sulfur 
dioxide and particulates. 
Many researchers have 
concluded that other air 
pollutants, such as lead, 
nitrogen oxides. carbon 
monoxide and ozone also are 
sources of damage to human 
and economic health . 

SCIENCE AND 
ENGINEERING 

MAJORS: 

Nonetheless. even Free· 
man's limi ted estimate of 
clean air benefit is $4.4 billion 
over and above the $17 billion 
cost of complying with clean 
air regulation . In anyone's 
book, that should be regarded 
as sou nd economic policy. 

Despite uch evidence, the 
admini tration and other 
cri tics of e n viro nm ental 
regulation conti nu e to assert 
that the Clean Air Act has 
ignificantly reduced overall 

growth and productivity, 
increased unemployment and 
whipped up inflation. 

Such claims imply 
evaporate under scrutiny. My 
own review; with Prof. Adam 
Rose of the University of West 
Virginia, of recent studies 
exploring the economic 
impacts of the Clean Air Act 
since 1970 suggests the 
following conclu ions: 

-Unemployment actual 
Iy was 0.1 to 0.2 percent lower 
per year than it would have 
been without clean air 
legislation because of 
increased capital investment 
and the labor·intensive nature 
of pollution control. 

-Output, as measured by 
the gross national product, has 
remained essentially un · 
changed from what it would 
have been without the act, 
with only a modest reduction 
of approximately 0.1 percent 
per year. When adjusted to 
take into account the economic 
value of benefits such as 
improved human health.

which are not reflected in 
market transactions. real 
economic welfare actually has 
increased. 

-Prices, a measured by 
the Consumer Price Index, 
increased only slightly from 
levels which would have 
prevailed without the 
legislation. from 0.1 to 0.2 
percent per year. Again , 
consideration of the non· 
market benefits uggesb that 
air pollution control have had 
virtually no effect on inflation. 

-Labor productiVIty. as 
conventionally measured . has 
declined by less than 0.1 
percent per year from what it 
would have been without the 
Clean Air Act Inclusion of the 
unmeasured benefits of the act 
again suggests that air quality 
controls actually have 
increa ed labor productivity. 
partly by improving the 
overall health of the work 
force . 

-The co ts of clean air 
compliance incurred by 
private industry have 
remained stable si nce 1975 in 
real terms. The combined 
co ts of public and private 
ectors have repre ented only 

0.6 percent of the GNP since 
1970. 

Despite this evidence. critics 
continue to argue that 
environmental regulation 
have retarded economic 
growth rates. ThIS claim IS 
refuted by a recent Environ· 
mental Protection Agency 
study which sought to find out 

what kind of economIc gains 
could be expected from a major 
cutback of aIr quality 
regulati ons. The st udy 
concluded that a 30 percent 
reduction of Clean Air Act· 
related costs would not 
improve any of the standard 
measure of economIc health 
by as much as one·tenth of one 
percent. 

Clearly, if the objectlve of 
the administration is to hift 
the economy mto higher 
growth rates and productivity 
gains, revision of the Clean Air 
Act - and em'ironmental 
leg! lation in general - i' not 
where the action is. 

In fact, the mandated 
Investments m clean aIr 
actl\·lties actually may have 
bol tered the economy In the 
1970 by IOcreasing total 
investments during a penod of 
stagnation and declInIng 
capital utilization . In addition. 
evidence from some industries 
uggests that pollution control 

innovation re . ulted In 
reduced co t of materIals and 
energy. which translated into 
increased productivity and 
economic growth. 

Thi eVIdence does not 
suggest that environmental 
regulations should be viewed 
a economic policy in tru· 
ment . The regulation are 
costly. and they hould be 
Impo ed only if the benefits 
(economic and aesthetic ) 
exceed the cost .

Law school ties examined by committee 

Various aspects of possible merger investigated by UCSD 
BY PAUL FARWELL 

Associate Ne" s Editor 
The details of a possible 

merger between UCSD and 
the California Western School 
of Law continue to take shape 
this week. 

At a metting with Chancel-
lor Richard Atkinson last 
Monday, members of a special 
committee gathered to discuss 
plans to bring a law school to 
UCSD. 

However, assistant chancel-
lor Pat Ledden, a member of 
the committee, has stated that 
the law school- if acquired-
would possibly be admini-
strated like the UCSD School 
of Medicine. (The medical 
school is headed by a dean who 
reports directly to the 
chancellor). 

Ledden added that prestig-
ious, "high level " law 
professors might be hired to 
augment Western's present 
staff. 

possible that (Cal Western's) 
$15 million in assets could be 
used in such a way so that 
there would be no need for an 
acquisition cost per se by the 
state." 

Moreover, Ledden envisions 
charging $10,000 to $15,000 in 
admission fees until the cost of 
operating a law school could be 
worked gradually into the 
UCSD budget. 

And, according to Ledden, 
UCSD already has a "non-

trivial" law collection in its 
libraries, which would greatly 
reduce the cost of initiating a 
brand new legal library. 

Monday's meeting 
Chairman York described 

Monday's meeting as "an 
organizational" meet ing in 
which "we talked among 
ourselves how to proceed (in 
the law school merger). 

"It was also scheduled so 
that the chancellor could give 

us his thoughts on the 
subject," York added. 

However , York was 
unwilling to disclose the exact 
content of the chancellor's 
statements. 

But Ledden said, "I think it 
would he great for the 
university to have a law 
school. I can think of only one 
great university that doesn 't 
have a law school. That's 
Princeton . " "We've been asked by the chance llor to make a 

judgement about the value of a 
possible merger with Cal 
Western and to consider how 
it might be done," said Herbert 
York , chairman of the 
committee for a law school 
merger . 

Budgetary problems 
With recent cuts in the 

California budget , the UCSD 
administration may lack the 
funds needed to acquire a law 
school. However, Ledden feels 
confident that no budgetary 
problems are impeding the 
course of a merger. 

N ew AS structure proposed 
York added that the 

formation of a committee is 
only "the first step" toward 
acquiring a law school, and 
that concrete details will be 
worked out in the weeks to 
come. 

"If a plan is worked out an 
approved by our board and 
submitted to the Board of 
Regents," Ledden said, "it is

During a lengthy president-
ial address at las t night's AS 
meeting, AS President Jules 
Bagneris announced his 
strategy for increasing the 
political power of the student 
body. 

"We do not have the 
structure that unifies the 
student agencies on campus." 
Bagneris told fellow council 
members, adding that UCSD 
needs a student structure in 
which an autonomous "board 
of controllers" oversees every 
student organization in the 
student center. 

Bagneris' model for student 
goverment is directly 
patterned after the UCLA

"control board", a powerful 
board of director appointed by 
the ASUCLA, faculty, and 
administration. 

Several AS member ' scoffed 
at Bagneri ' proposal , calling 
it an unrealistic comparison of 
the UCLA and UCSD 
campuses. 

"There are several problems 
with the UCLA analogy," 
Reggie Williams, Commission-
err of Student Welfare, said. 
"First of all , UCLA has many 
more times the assets of 
UCSD. And secondly, it (the 
UCLA "control board'') was 
formed a long time ago when 
the administration was more 
open to that kind of thing. 

"It's an ambitious proposal. 
and it will take a lot of co-

operation," Williams added 
David Tollner, Commission-

er of Activity Fee, was less 
sympathetic to Bagneris ' 
proposal. 

". can t believe he 's even 
serious," Tollner said. "I have 
no idea what he' trying to 
accomplish or even why. It 's 
not at all realistic." 

Bagneris defended his idea 
by terming the present AS 
body a mere "advisor" to the 
Vice-Chancellor of Under-
graduate Affairs , Joseph 
Watson, and added that a 
powerful "control board" in 
needed to equalize political 
power between students and 
the administration.

Civil illiteracy 
continued from page 2 
reason why thi i 0: 
Profe ors don't ufficiently 
encourage their student to 
upplement class work with 

extra reading of current 
event . The lack of student 
interest, in turn, may 
di courage faculty member 
from keeping up themselves. 

In the Wake Fore t college 
library, one economics 
profe or conceded that he 
hadn't read The Atlantic 
Monthly magazine interview 
with Budget Director David 
Stockman, let alone assign it 
to his class. And he added that 
mo t of his colleagues had 
probably not read it either. 

When a student's only 
reality is that which link 
schooling to a post·graduate 
paycheck, he or she will 
inevitably leave political and 
social issues to the dreaded 
special·interest community. 
And that leads to the "blind 
faith" that worries Boyer and 
Hechinger. In the name of civic 
competence, the authors 
suggest lacing courses "from 
literature to nuclear physics" 
with relevant i sues and 
questions pertaining to those 
fields. 

Of course, endemic civic 
illiteracy will be difficult to 
overcome. College acro s the 
cou ntry , bedeviled bv a 

shrinking pool of teenage 
applicants and financial woes, 
will be filling classrooms with 
student who are older and 
more geared to pecialized 
training. Profe sors will also 
be hard-pressed to temper 
their "publish·or-perish" 
maxim which may help to 
guarantee tenure but often 
obfuscates their larger 
mission: a well·rounded 
student. 
. Whil~ the '70 aw colleges 
Increasmgly bend to ociety's 
demands, the '80s require 
them to provide direction . As 
the Carnegie report concludes, 
the academic community must 
not only prepare the young for 
productive careers, but.. .en· 
able them to live lives of 
dignity and purpose ... not 
".lerely ... increase participa' 
tlOn at the polls, but...help 
shape a citizenry that ran 
weigh deci ions wisely and 
more effectively promote the 
public good." 

This mandate may seem 
optimistic at first. making 
American youth ~eel part of 
the proce s might not be 
pos ' ible. but any movement 
towards a more informed 
populace will be beller than 
the rut of ignorance and the 
vicious cycle of indifference 
that are currently leading us 
nowhere.

UCSD financial aid cuts hurt many 
By RANDY HILL remainil'!g two quarters. The 

Staff Writer net loss In aid to financial aid 
UCSD students on financial 

aid received a very surprising 
and rather unwelcome 
Christmas present when they 
picked up their checks last 
December. Student Financial 
Services office decreased 
financial aid packages for all 

students is $50 per student. 
The one-time urcharge of 

$25 to be assessed Spring 
Quarter will not be covered by 
SFS. All st udents will have to 
pay that fee themselves . 

A memo was sent to all 
fi~ancial aid s.tudent during 
Winter Break, IOforming them 
of the changes. However, 
many financial aid students 
learned of the aid cut earlier in 
the month, when they were 
asked to sign revised financial 
aid offer letters reflecting the 

financial aid, "I was shocked 
(by the new of the cuts.) 1 
couldn't believe that they 
could do this to us on such 
short notice." 

News of such cuts 0 late 
into the year came as a 
urpri se to most financial aid 

students, although SFS did 
notify students as early a last 
su,mmer that such changes 
mIght be required. 

the new indicator earlier this 
week, inflation, overenroll -
ment , federal. budget cuts, and 
the UC fee Increase affected 
the 1981-82 budget. 

SFS was faced with the 
choice in October of giving 400-
500 students who enrolled late 
no money at all, or cutting all 
student's packages by some 
amount. 

According to Rutter's 
advertised statement 
fiancial aid packages in 1982: 
83 will be drastically affected 
by the budget problems. 
"Each student package will 
include a $1000 increase in the 
minimum expected student 
contribution over the amount 
previously expected." 

'''82-'83 is going to be a 
whole new ballgame .... The 
quality of the (financial aid) 
package is going to be lower." 
Rutter told the Guardian . He 
stated that many more loan 
and far fewer grants will be 
awarded in fu ture year . 

tudents by $200 for the 
remainder of the 1981·82 
academic year. 

According to SFS Director, 
Tom Rutter, a variety of 
factors resulted in the decision 
to cut financial aid. In an 
adverti ement appearing in 
both the UCSD Guardian and 

"We had the option to cease 
awarding when we ran out of 
money," Rutter explained. This cut was offset by an 

increase in Fee Payment 
Authorizations of $150. to 
cover the increase in fees 
adopted by the Regents for the 

changes. 
According to one student on 

SFS funding problems were 
ex<!:c~rbated by a $240,000 
defICIt from the 1980-81 school 
year.

minutes with the percussion section of the L.A.

New Year's Resolution: if there is even one 

puff of a cloud in the sky next New Year's Eve .... 

According to AS Program-
mlllg Commi sioner Adam 
Forrest, Muir Provost John 
Stewart and Muir Dean Chips 
Dreilinger became concerned 
that serving beer near the 
Muir dorms would endanger 
enf~rc.ement of policies 
forblddmg minors - most 
dorm re idents - from 
consuming alcohol. 

Stewart told the Guardian 
that Muir House Advisors 
brought the potential problem 
• 1 the administration's 

Forrest said that no other 
locations for the TGIF could be 
secured at this late date. 

Because the cancellation 
came after some contracts 
were finalized with entertain-
ment, food and beverage 
suppliers, Forrest estimates 
that there will be about $260 
lost. Stewart indicated that 
Muir college would consider 
assuming liability for the debt. 

"We're blamable here at 
Muir for not discussing the 
problems earlier," Stewart 
said. He stressed. however, 
that the Muir administration 
is npt against TGIFs and that 

Forrest said that he and AS 
officials are mainly upset with 
Muir administrators for 
changing what they assumed 
to be finalized plan thi late in 
the week. The "blue form" 
relinquishing control of Muir 
Quad to and placing 
respon ibility for damage on 
the AS was signed before 
Christmas, according to 
Forrest. 

Forrest said he could not 
understand why, when it was 
understood at the time of 
signing the form that alcohol 
would be erved and the AS 
would be liable for it , that 
there should now be a problem 
in renegotiating the terms of 
the Quad's use.

"It's not only good for the 
program, but there are 
potential benefits for our 
students," said Ginger Ochs, 
director of the program . 
"Accreditation may give our 
graduates more flexibility to 
go from state to state, when 
other states recognize the 
accreditation program. 

"It also might help us set up 
a scholarship or stipend 
program . The training 
program i s extre mely 
expensive, and demands so 
much of the student 's time 
that it's very difficult to work 
and go through training," she 
added. 

An average of about 60 
students a year are admitted to 
the five·month program, 
which trains paramedics for 
San Diego and Imperial 
counties. The program started 
in January 1975, and is now 
training its 24th class. 

Tn the past , no national 
accreditation program existed . 
Each state had its own laws 
regarding the minimum hours 
a student had to spend 
training to be a paramedic, but 
the AMA's essentials and 
guidelines provide the first 
extensive set of criteria to 
develop and evaluate 
curriculum. 

Paramedics provide emer· 
gency medical treatment at 
the scene of an accident. 
helping to stabilize seriously 
ill or injured patients before 
transportation to a hospital. 
The early emergency treat· 
ment by paramedics can mean 
the difference between life and 
death for victims of overdose, 
heart attack and major 
accidents. 

Students are nl)w sponsored 
for admi sion by paramedic 
agencies. Next March , 
individual s who are not 
spon ored, but want to receive 
training, will be admitted to 
the program.

Some notes on developing the A-bomb 
Recently declassified documents shed light on project 

This article is the first in a two 
part series on the development of 
the atomic bomb by the United 
States during WWlI. A history 
of the bomb's development, 
written in 1945, has recently 
beet! declassified mLd summar· 
ized in this release from the Los 
Alamos National Laboratory. 

In the early 1940's, US Air 
Force personnel were talking 
guardedly of "Thin Man" and 
"Fat Man ," code names for 
American President Roosevelt 
and British Prime Minister 
Churchill, and the modifica· 
tion of planes to carry these 
VIPs to a meeting. These 
conversations were a hoax , 
part of one of the world's 
largest and most successful 
cover stories to protect the 
atomic bomb secret. 

Such details were revealed 
December 18, 1981. when a 
secret brief history of "Project 
A," the design, assembly, and 
delivery of the only atomic 
weapons used in warfare, 
underwent final review and 
was declared unclassified . 

Written in the Mariannas in 
1945 by a young Columbia 
University associate professor 
of physics who was recruited 
to work as an expert 
consu ltan t to the Wa r 
Department, the history was 
declassified in 1973, and 

placed in the unclassified files 
shortly before Christmas 
1981. The author, Norman F . 
Ramsey, is now Higgins 
Professo r of Ph ysics at 
Harvard University's Lyman 
Physics Laboratory. Hi s 
insight into Project A, in 
which he served as chief of the 
bomb delivery group, provides 
a fascinating glimpse of the 
machinations deemed neces· 
sary to protect the wartime 
secret of the ultimate weapon . 

The history of Project A is 
the hi story of the combat use 
of the atomic bomb. Project 
members were responsible for 
use of the world's first nuclear 
explosion against an enemy, as 
opposed to the experimental, 
static firing of a nuclear 
explosion at a test site. Project 
Y was the War Department 's 
code name for the secret Los 
Alamos Laboratory where the 
weapons used on Japan were 
designed and produced. The 
two projects were inextricably 
intertwined. as World War II 
ground on . 

The first major activity of 
the delivery group began in 
June, 1943, when Ramsey 
surveyed US Air Force planes 
to determine what size, shape, 
and weight of weapon they 
could carry. At this time, only 
the gun·type weapon was 

DANCE! 

being considered, and it was 
thought that to achieve a 
velocity of 3,000 feet per 
second , a bomb carrying 
plutonium-239 would have to 
be about 17 feet long. The B·29 
bomber was the only suitable 
craft. and it would need 
extensive modification, so that 
the bomb could extend into 
both the front and rear bomb 
bays, close under the main 
wing spar; except for the B·29 
and the British Lancaster 
bomber, all other aircraft 
would require that such a 
weapon be mounted external· 
ly. When full·scale tests were 
necessary, it was suggested 
that the Lancaster be used for 
tests and the B·29 reserved for 
an actual drop, but the 
decision was made to go ahead 
and modify the B·29 for both 
tests and drop, as a cost 
saving. 

US Navy Captain (later 
Admiral) W.S. Parsons. chief 
of Project A, and Ramsey, a 
deputy, selected two external 
shapes and weights for 
weapons, based on the ongoing 
work at Los Alamos , so that B-
29 modifications could begin . 
One weapon was 204 inches 
long, with a maximum 
diameter of 23 inches, and 
served as a model for the gun· 
assembly design . The econd 

bomb was 111 inches long and 
59 inches in diameter , 
corresponding to the latest 
design implosion assembly. 
For security reasons. the Air 
Force dubbed these weapons 
the "Thin Man" and the "Fat 
Man," and tried to make their 
telephone conversations 
sound as if they were 
modifying the B·29 to carry 
Roosevelt (the thin man) and 
Chruchill (the fat man). 

Early tests of dummy 
atomic bombs were not 
promising. Results necessita· 
ted many changes in design 
and fabrication. The first drop 
tests of such prototypes, to 
determine stability in flight, 
were on a born b shape thought 
to be suitable for a gun 
a sembly. The model was a 
long length of 14·ince sewer 
pipe welded into the middle of 
a split, standard . 5()().pound 
bomb. It was dubbed "The 
Sewer Pipe Bomb," and it was 
an ominous and spectacular 
failure . 

"The bomb fell in a flat spin, 
the like of which had rarely 
been seen before." Ramsey 
wrote in his hi tory. An 
increase in fin area and other 
modifications finally provided 
stability , but in the months 
following. ever·changing gun 

models were designed and 
tested 

[n eptem ber, ]943, the new 
implosion bomb was proposed 
as an alternative to the 
previous implosion design , and 
it was clear that the new 
design was promising. 
Estimates concluded the 
weapon would measure 59 
inches in diameter and weigh 
9.000 pounds. The bombgroup 
of the Bureau of Standards 
was asked to desi~n suitable 
fairing and stabilizmg fins for 
the weapon. A companion gun· 
assembly design model with a 
diameter of 23 inche was the 
second weapon used in 
determining the nece sary 
modifications to the carrier 
aircraft. 

Tests of full·scale dummy 
weapons and modified B·29s 
began in California 's Mojave 
Desert in the spring of 1943. 

"After fou r weeks of 
torrential rains and aircraft 
problems , a serie of tests was 
finally completed," Ramsey 
wrote. "The negative results 
of most of the e tests 
thoroughly ju tified the 
holding of prelimInary runs at 
uch an early date. The fuses 

proved unreliable and 
modifications were needed .

The 1982-83 award cycle will be altered to a greater degree than 

1981 -82. Each student's package will include a $100 increase in the 
minimum expected student contribution over the amount previously 
expected. (The 1982-83 student contributions will be $1700 tor first 
year dependent students, $1900 tor continuing dependent students, 
and $2200 for independent students and tor graduate students). This 
expected student contribution, though not directly funded by the 
Student Financial Services Office, can be met in a variety ot ways: 
summer savings, academic year employment. or Guaranteed Student 
Loan. By increasing the expected student contributions tor 1982-83, 
we will be able to continue to award an equitable and complete 
package ot available aid funds to all on-time applicants. Also, to be able 
to perform a more accurate assessment ot each student's family's 
ability to contribute to the student's educational expenses, all 1982-83

Do you have doubts about 
life after death? Do you 
wonder what kind of 
employment will be available 
to you in the hereafter? Or 
maybe you wanted to learn 
about do-it-your.elf embalm· 
ing? All thi and more is 
covered tn Doktor Bey's Book 0/ 
the Dead, a comprehensive 
tudy of death by a disturbed 

English gentleman named 
Derek Pell. (Sorry Grateful 
Dead fans if the title was 
misleading.) 

Billed as an "underground" 
c lassic, this paperback 
uncover many historical facts 
that shed light on darkness . 
Undertakers playa large role 
tn the due process of death, 
and the Doktor gives them 
their proper credit. There is a 
list of the top ten in a who's 
who of the bUSiness or as he 
calls it "the world's coldest 
profession." 

The e morticians must also 
be highly killed in the art of 
etern al preservation. A best-
dressed dead li s t is included 
a long with a how to gift wrap a 
mummy diagram (so imple a 
chi ld could do it) and a note on 
artistic display po tu res for 
fixed stiffs. 

It may appear undertakers 
have no fun, but nothi ng cou ld 
be farther from t he truth. The 
book gives over 20examples of 
funeral parlour games uch as, 
"follow the bleeder,"' "tug-of 

books 
gore," "carcas archery" and 
of course ., formaldehyde and 
seek." 

The book is filled with 
fabulous drawing of 
everything from a day·care 
center for the dead to a display 
of t he latest models in Hearses. 
If vou have been wondering 
what Heaven ("the die-
cleaners") look like, there's' 
an illustration. Or maybe you 
were curious about Hell ("the 
last resort"). It is all in this 
demented collection of facts

Japanese 
film will 
play Fri. 

--Arts Bulletin Board--
UCLA is now accepting 
entries for scriptwriting 

The film Kagemusha (The 
Shadow Warrior) will be 
shown in Mandeville Auditor· 
ium on Friday Night at 8 p.m. 
This is the work of Japan's 
most prominent and interna· 
tionally reknown filmmaker 
Akira Kurosawa. His films 
include Seven Samurai, and 
Rashomon, which have been 
remade for the American 
Cinema. 

Kagemusha is set in 16th 
century feudal Japan . It 
depicts the life of a condemned 
thief who takes the place of a 
dying Japanese Warlord. After 
the death of the Warlord 
Takeda the thief assumes the 
identity of the Warlord in both 
battle and in the home of his 
former benefactor . The 
transition of the thief into the 
Warlord is a truly haunting 
experience and the audience 
can sympathize with his 
plight. 

Entries for the 27th annual 
Samuel Goldwyn Awards 
Competition for Theater, Film 
and Television Writing are 
being accepted now through 
Feb. 1 by the Dean 's Office, 
College of Fine Arts at UCLA. 

A first prize of $4,500 and 
two second prizes of $1 ,000 
each will be awarded to the 
best full · length dramati c 
scrip.ts ~u bmitted . . 

Students at all n ine 
campuses of the University of 
California who are enrolled 
both the Fall 1981 and Winter 
1982 quarters are eligible to 
enter the co mp eti t ion . 
Winners will be announced by 
Mr. Goldwyn and the College 
of Fine Arts by the end of May , 
1982. 

Details or copies of the 
contest rules may be obtained 
from th e Dean 's Office,

It is a unique v isual 
experience and the cinemato· 
g r aph y is e xtraordinary . 
George Lucas and Francis 
Fo rd Coppola were the 
executive producers of this 
film and they provided the 
fi n ancial backing for its 
international release. There is 
a s pecial ded ication to George 
Lucas by Akira Kurosawa in 
the film 

This is the most expensive 
film ever filmed in Japan , and 
it is well worth the $1.75 
admission price. 

In Akita Kurosawa's Kagemusha (The Shadow Warrior), an 
epic drama of feudal conflict in 16th-century Japan, Tatsuya 
Nakadi stars as a petty thief who impersonates a powerul 
Warlord. It will be showing Friday night in Mandeville. 

A -closing reception will be 
held on Friday for two art 
exhibits by UCSD s tudents, 
Lynona Cannon and Joan I. 
Staveley, at the Mandeville

Books: fun

intense for younger readers) 
on page 137 we have "the joys 
of necrophilia. " She never sa ys 
" no"; one less orgasm to worry 
about; plenty of fish in the sea; 
and necrophilia means never 
having to say you 're sorry. Pell 
has already written Doktor 
Bey's Handbook of Strange Sex 
so thi s is right up his alley. 

No reference book would be 
complete without an appendix, 
and this is no exception. A 
literal dictionary of death and 
dying. For example: nicra-
ph iliac -- one who violates the 
body of Santa Claus; mortoon 
- suspended animation; and 
dead spread - posi tion of legs 
during autopsy. 

Voktor Bey's Book of the Dead 
has a thin plot to say the least. 
Referred to as "a Michelin 
gu ide to the other side," [ 
recommend it to anyone living 
or dead. With his ghoulish 
stories and macabre illustra-
t ions. Pell has reinforced my 
belief, " If you can 't make fun 
of death , what can you make 
fun of?"

Tritons curb Bulldogs 
Barney, Wight and one-handed Dabisinskas 
lead team in home opener over Redlands 

By BOB McSPADDEN 
Senior taff Writer 

83·58. It was a point spread 
that the Tritons have not seen 
from either ide in their young 
1982 ea on, a margin which 
UCSD earned in it home 
opener Tuesday night against 
the University of Redlands. 

UCSD floored a starting 
quad which was still in 

recuperation from a 3·6 
December road trip through 
the Midwest, but if you were 
there you couldn't tell. 
Michael Barney, ole returnee 
from last year's squad. had 
high point honors with] 7. "It 
was a hard fought win," 
smiled tl1e ophomore 
forward, "and [ think we're 
finally ready for the season." 

One notch behind Barney 
was the Triton's season point 
leader Tommy Wight with ]6, 
who twice brought a partisan 
crowd to its feet with his 
version of the slam dunk. 

Perhaps one of the best 
performances for UCSD came 
in the shoes of 6' 8W' center 
Mike Daba inskas . The 225 

, lb. freshman from nearby San 
Pasqual High tallied ten points 
in his relief of Mark Barreca, 
himself supportive of the 
Triton backboard . Dabasin· 
skas' show was somewhat 
muffled with a broken hand 
that he suffered earlier in the 
eason , but in full cast which 

closely resembled the paw of a 
grizzly bear, "Dabo" 
overshadowed the smaller 

Bulldog team_ "When I get this 
off Thursday it will be like 
getting my second half back," 
he said. 

The win itself sported the 
qualities of some very good 
teamwork. Ten of the twelve 
Tritons who appeared found 
the hole in the rim, four hitting 
double figures (Wight, Mike 
Maross, Barney, Dabasin· 
skas). The Tri tons also 
remained out of foul trouble, 
something which has plagued 
them thus far and was 
highlighted by a six technical· 
foul game. 

At the half UCSD had 
claimed a 32-23 advantage, 
and when the red Bulldogs 
returned from intermission

Men's basketball teant hits 
the road for fun, practice 

By BOB McSPADDEN 
Senior St aff W riter 

When most collegiate teams travel across the 
country to compete with another school, 
transportation usually takes the form of a 
jetli n(!J; or busli ne. Now, there are road trips and 
there are road trips, and then there i the UCSD 
Men's Basketball Motorhome Express. 

Over the month lapse in December coaches 
John Block and Tom Marshall escorted the 
T ritons on a 16 day tour through the West, 
stoppi ng occasionally to play orne very 
competitive teams. The ten man travelling 
squad not on ly played and practiced together, 
but also ate, slept and entertained themselves 
toget her. 

" ft was a great way for everyone to get to 
know each other," explained second year coach 
Block. "None of t hese guys had ever played 
toget her before this year and I th ink the trip 
helped us out on the court." 

Although the blue and gold posted a 3-5 record 
on the journey after bowing to San Diego State . 
in the season opener, the games were never 
decided until the final buzzer. Seven of the eigh t 
contests were margined by five points or less, 

the eighth game giving UCSD a 64·58 win over 
Colorado College. 

The Tritons owe much of their strength this 
season to 6'4" guard Tommy Wight. For the 
Tritons thus far the senior transfer has caged 
21.8 points perogamf; a mark which could set a 
new UCSD record. 

In the backcourt Wight is joined by junior 
transfer Bob Goodman, a quick 6'0 guard who 
has dropped in a cool 17.8 points per showing 
with a shooting percentage of .639. 

Also keys on the Triton court are sophomore 
forward Michael Barney, freshman fo rward 
Mark Barreca, junior forward Mike Maross and 
freshman center Mike Dabasinskas, who 
suffered a broken hand on the trip. 

T he 34·foot rented motorcoach was equipped 
with a video system that allowed the team to 
watch various movies and game film s 
throughout the trek. The only thing it didn't 
have was enough power to haul the squad 
th rough Wolf Creek Pass in Colorado, where 
the team gladly piled out for a nice jog in the 20 
degree weather while their coach coaxed the 
home uphill.

Inexperienced lacrosse 
club defeats strong SDSU 

By VALERI S. ANDERS 
Staff Writer 

What is lacro e? 
The word brings t'o mind 

visions of athletic preppies 
who live their off·the·fi eld 
lives in Izods and topsiders. 
Act u a ll y, Random House 
define the sport a "a game 
played by two teams with a 
ball and long·handled, netted 
rackets. " 

Lacrosse, which looks like a 
combination of field hockey 
and Jai Alai , was foreign to 
UCSD's athletic program -
until recently. Intercollegiate 
laero se has arrived on 
campus. 

League action for the 
Tritons starts Feb. 14, with a 
tournament at UCLA erving 
a a warm up. 

a rranging the times and places 
the team can meet, pract ice, 
and compete. Since the team 
wa not formed un til fa ll 
quarter, arrangements for 
these act ivit ies must be fit 
around the already ex isting 
chedules of other port, and 

t he players' ind ividual clas 
and work schedules. EYen 0, 
the team manages to practice 
approximately eight hours a 
week. 

UCSD's RecClub is doing all 
it ca n for lacrosse, but 
unfortunately it cannot afford 
to appropriate any funds to it. 

"The Rec Club has been a 
big help," aid Scott Hill , who 
along with David Hammond 
started and organized the 
team, "they have put up flyers, 
and given us time and energy. 
But they don't haveany money 
to give us." 

movie TOMMY Sunday in 
T LH. 107. The AS is backing 
up the cost of showing the 
movie, which wi ll run at both 
6:45 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. Tickets 
can be purcha ed at the box 
office for $1.50, and at the door 
for $2. A short fi lm of 
championship lacro se will 
a lso be shown. 

At pre ent, there are 25 
people on the team, and others 
int erested in joining are 
encouraged to attend a 
meeting tonight, Jan. 7, in the 
Rec Gym room &.t 8 p.m. 

Prior to thi year, many of 
the team's player had never 
even seen a lacro se match, 
much Ie s played in one. But 
Hammond feels "confident 
that the team will do well." 
mentioning their 7·2 victory 
over SDSU last quarter. 

Atheletes of the Week 
Mary Eagan - Women's Basketball 

T aking care of th e tough assignmen ts around t he basket, 
Center Mary Eagan is leading the team with 11.7 points per ' 
game and is also averaginga team·high 8.3 rebounds . CoachJudy 
Malone calls her ' ''one of the most important players on the 
team." Earl ie r in the year again st USD Eagan scored 14 points 
and had 9 rebounds despite bei ng guarded by a 6'5" Cent er a nd 
two forwa rds over 6'3". 
Michael Barney - Men 's Basketball 

6'4" Forward Mich ael Barney was the leading scorer in 
Tuesday n ight's victor y over the University of Redlands. He had 
17 points on 8· 15 field goal shooting. The slim sophomore a lso 
slipped inside for 11 rebounds. Barney averages 15 points, and 
3.9 rebounds per game. 

The Women's Volleyball team, which won the NCAA 1981 
Division [IJ championship last month, will present h ir trophy 
to Chancellor Richard Atkin on Friday at 12:30 p.m. on the gym 
steps. If the weather i inclement the hart ceremony will be 
moved to The Pu b. 

The volleyball team had a 36·8 record this past season 
including an incredible 22·0 against Div. III opponents. 

Tammy Smit, Kristen Kilbourn and the rest of. the 
enthusiastic quad attracted a large following lending credit to 
the belief that volleyball has become the most popular sport o n 
campus. 

Although the lacrosse squad 
plays for the school, it is a club 
team - meaning it receives no 
funds from UCSD directly . 

In an effort to help the team 
get off its feet , campu . 
organizations are stepping in 
with time and resources, but 
as yet lacrosse has received no 
financial contribution . 

So, even with the help of 
both the Intramural and Rec 
offices, the lacrosse team is 
eeking aid from additional 

sources to pay for road trips, 
uniforms, and equipment.

team. "We needed a little time 
to get eltled into an offense 
against their strong pressing 
defen e, but after the first 
timeout we played consistent· 
Iy ," remarked sophomore head 
coach John Block. "They were 
a very quick and strong team 
and I felt that our entire sq uad 

played hard together," he 
added. 

UCSD will continue its 
three·game homesland this 
Friday in a 7:30 p.m. contest 
with Nebraska Wesleyan 
University. It is expected that 
Dabasinskas will return to his. 
starting duties at center, and 
guard Bob Goodman (8 points) 

will be better healed from a 
sprained ankle injury . 

With another game Tuesday 
against UC Riverside, t he 
Tritons will prepare to meet 
national leader Biola College 
Jan . 16 on the opponents' floor. 
This Friday's game will also be 
the second opportun ity for the
