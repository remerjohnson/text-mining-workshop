more years, the Chancellor rul d 
last w ek . 

In addition, M Elroy allowed 
th tudent Cooperative to

The referendum received only 

Vi percent participation . Si nce 
the UC Regents require a SO 
percent rate before the results 
can be holding . recom -

asp ct of the referendum, and 
reviewing it afterwards - and the 
vice-chancellor, to be acted on by 
th Chancellor.

Chancellor indicated that the 
Coop would not pretend to be the 
official voice of the un -
dergraduates, and the members 

~peaking to issues reflect the 
opInion only of them elves . 

The Cha ncellor also en-
couraged the Coop to " formalize 
It status , through orne 
mechanism reflecting student 
Views, during the 1975-76 chool 
year, " aid Murphy. 

The Chancellor al 0 approved a 
recommended moratorium on 
future referenda challenging the 
Campus Activity Fee for two 
year . The moratorium was 
recommended because of the 

cost of running a student 
referendum , which ca me to $400

The initial goals the Union 
decided to work towards include

'Consenting Adults ' Bill 

GSA Here Sees End of Harassment 
by John H. Tay lor 

Editor-in-Chief 

The controversial bill to remove criminal sanc-
tions for private sexual acts between consenting 
adult , passed by both the California Assembly and 
enate, will take away poli e forces' "vehicle for 

haras ment" of homosexuals, a 5pokesman for UC 
an Diego' Gay Student A sociatlOn (GSA) said 

yesterday . 

" Under present laws, homo exual~ are branded 
for what is illegal , and therefore to some people 
' Immoral : behavior ," he said 

"We feel it's time for law enforcement to get out 
of the bedrooms and begin to protect people 
agalO t victim crimes," he aid 

"We don 't need thl new law to find out we're not 
crimlOals , but if there are law that ay we are, we'd 
like to get rid of them ."

The bill , which squeaked through the enate last 
week after Lt . Gov Mervyn Dymally flew to 

acramento from Colorado to break a 20-20 tie, has 
now been sent back to the as embly for an ex-
pected concurrence with enate-made amend-
ments

con ervatlve Republican from Arcadia , aid the bill 
would be seen as legaliZing homo exual behavior 
and would " make it aSler for homo exuals to

to gain official recognition as UC

the tudent Cooperative Monday 
did not upport a motion of

Ha tlngs College of Law . In 
addi tion , tempers flared on the 
,ubjec t of funding the recent 
campus referendum .

The Coop had a motion 

brought before it to urge the 
legi la ture to approve Assembly 
I3dl tl10, which would provide for 
the allocation of funds to pur-
chase the Cal Western law school 
In downtown San Diego . 

Mark Bookman, director of the 
student center, and a member of 
the Bar, told the Coop, " There 
IS no question of the high quality 
of th Ha tings Law School, and 
that the an Diego area can use a 
public, high quality law school. " 

After a eries of questions that 
were an wered by a student from 

al W stern, the motion failed to 
gai n the necessary two-thirds 
majority to pass . 

In addition, the recently -
completed referendum wa a

Medial Perpetrates 'Bloodbath' Notion 

by We~ y Everest 

[If' esJey Everest is It 
pseudo1lym for a UC Sa" Diego 
gradulJte stude"t, ) 

Throughout the latest wave of 
victories of the Communist forces 
in Indochina, the media has 
hysterically been warning us of 
the forthcoming "bloodbath." 
This term has never been defined, 
but we may assume that the 
newly victorious forces will not 
bomb dikes as the fascists did in 
Holland or as we did In " North" 
Vietnam; nor will they bomb 
ho pitals as we did; nor will they 
fire-bomb as we did in Dresden or 
drop napalm as we did all over 
Vietnam and Cambodia; nor will 
they attempt mass terror by 
dropping our " leftover" 
asphyxiation bombs on the 
civilian population, as was done 
to Xuan Loc after it "fell;" nor will 
they defol ia te, nor in-
discriminately bomb the country-
ide to d~troy the " sea" in which 

" the guerilla fish swim." 

Perhaps a "bloodbath" means 
the instigation of a program of 
terror, such as the Phoenix 
program the US instigated in the 
Mekong delta. That killed over 
40,000 Vietnamese, and in the 
words of Ambassador Robert 
Komer (who had overall 
responsibility for it), " If we can 
attri t the population base of the 
Vietcong, i I'll accelerate the 
process of degrading the vc." But 
past history indicates that this 
policy does not work, and the 
PRG has consistently and 
vigorously condemned such 
tactics . 

The horror of which the 
American media is trying to 

convince us, the American 
people, is only the necessary 
forthcomi ng trials of Vietnamese 
collaborators and CIA operatives 
for war crimes. There is quite a 
difference between lawless, 
anarchistic slaughter -the con-
notations of "bloodbath"- and a 
serious trial of murderers, tor-
turers, and war criminals. Cer-
tainly the PRG and the whole 
Vietnamese people will want at 
least to bring to trial , and some 
cases, to execute those Phoenix 
program thugs who did not 
manage to escape (and are now 
making their way to California, 
the modern day Argentina and 
Paraguay) . 

(We worry about the added 
welfare burden. but rest assured, 
the CIA will find a use for these 
Vietnamese dregs as part of a new 
domestic terror police force.) 

So the government once again 
channels its lies through the 
media, and dutifu lIy try to 
convince us of what they think it 
is expedient for us to think . One 
need only notice that the press 
obediently reported the lies of a 
later exposed CiA radio broadcast 
from Cambodia of 43 beheadings . 
Unable to " learn," this was the 
same "mistake" the media made 
20 years ago when the CI A was 
exposed for broadcasting false 
horror stories from North Viet-
nam . And the naive might hope 
that the press, after being con-
sistently lied to by the govern-
ment throughout the Vietnam 
war, after all the damage its 
irresponsible reporting of the lies 
of prison officials at Attica 
ca used , would be a litHe 
scrupulous in the future .

Senior Writes of 
Pre-Med Experience 

by Timothy lester Hirsch 
I sat with trembling hands and a large lump in my throat as the 

evidence before me shamelessly and relentlessly made Its point again 
and again : 

Chemistry 3A-C 
Chemistry 38--C 
Chemistry lab--C 
Math 28-C 
Math 2O--C 
APIS 10-C. 

It was the beginning of winter quarter, sophomore year. I was alone 
In my dorm room. The elec troni cs were all off-No stereo, No TV, No 
light. No compassion. No understanding. No solace. Still, quiet air all 
about. 

Earlier in the afternoon, in an informal gathering With friends, we 
spoke about the grades that came in the mai.1 that day and our 
respective futures. Impressive sounding profeSSIOns: mediCine, law, 
business . My turn came around: " I think I want to be a doctor." 

I twas natu 'al , I suppose, for a friend to ask : "Well , what kind of 
grades do you have? You know you need all As in the sciences ." 

"Oh," I saic, ~y voice wavering just a bit. I confessed my science 
GPA was lowf'r ,than what I wanted it to be. 

"Co into s('c(o!ogy, thpn." was the answer. 
I excused m\oielf from the gathering and proceeded to take a long 

walk by the cliffs . I could not believe that I was " out of the race" to 
medical scho. )1 fter barely a year of co llege. It takes at least that long 
to get stablis d, to learn the system, to settle down! Would I be 
penalized fore er for a C in chemistry? Would I be shunned by ad-
missions of/it ers and flatly refused consideration because of two Cs In 
mathl Would I be denied entrance to the Biomed library because on 
my record there was written a ( in APIS 101 The master controllers of

supposedly Intercepted Cam-
bodean radio messagf'S, reporting 
that the long sought for 
"bloodbath" is finally occurring 
in Cambodia. Is the media truly 
unahlp to learn? Clearly no one is 
that stupid The USIA employs 
the reporters ; the CIA employs 
the reporters; and the media is 
complicit in the lying. 

One would hope the people of 
the United States consider it an 
insult to their intelligence.

Coast Plan Hearing Set for May 23 
Over 1000 miles of coastline 

form the scenic western border of 
California. The rapid growth of 
population , development, and 
interest in exploiting the coastal 
zone 's natural resources have put 
our coas t in serious danger. In 
November, 1972, the voters of 
California took the first step to 
protect the coast region with the 
passage of the Coastal Initiative 
(Proposition 20) The initiative 
provided for the founding of the 
California Coastal Zone Con-
serva tion Commiss ion . Through 
thi s body a Coastal Plan for the 
protec tion and prese rva ti on 
would be prepared . 

Most of you will be affected by 
the coast plan Many of you have 
grown up along or near the 
California coast and have ex-
perienced first-hand the beauty 
and ' tranquility of the coastal 
zone . You have probably wit-
nessed the overdevelopment of 
both smal l towns and large 
metropolitan areas such as los 
Angeles / Orance County . You 
have seen the damage done by 
oils spills and sewage drainage, 
the blocked access to tidal zones, 
the threat of malfunctions in 
nuclear power plants - the list 
goes on . 

Some of you are from the 
inland portions of the state . For 
the inland resident, a trip to the 
ocean becomes very frustrating 
when you have to travel miles up 
and down the coas t to find a

California, we all have the legal 
nght to experience the ocean 
from the mean high tide line to 
three miles out to sea . The 
problem is finding sufficient

If you have any interest in, or 
appreciation of the coastline, the 
Coastal Plan will affect you . 
Whether you agree with the 
comm i sion 's findings and 
policies or not, you should 
familiarize yourself with the plan 
and act now. 

This is what you can do: as of 
this date, the commission has 
come up with a Preliminary oast 
Plan, which was written to be 
changed with thE' outcome of

covers public acces, d velop-
ment, tramportatlon , recreation, 
energy , marine and COd tal

mendations for implementation 
of the plan . During May and June 
the public hearings will take 
place. Now is the time to find out 
the workings of the plan and

U IVERSITY OF THE PACIFI 

Student Sees Very 
Little Happening Here 

As I sit back and look at the students here and observe all the bio or 
preÂ·med majors, I see very little happening SOCially, politically, or 
humanistically on this campus. I am glad that I haven't declared a 
major yet because I have not planned out my entire future life at 
present. 

Most studen ts here are nearly dead sou ls living in fresh and bones. 
They have already been swallowed up into the system. Studies are the 
overriding consumer of most student's free time. They tell me the job 
market is tough, but get good grades and you' ll get right in there . Boy, 
that sounds droll to me . I ask my friends what they plan to do with the ir 
lives . They tell me they are going to be doctors, lawyers, engineers, 
chemists, and (PAs. 

It all seems so self-centered to me. I think that they will be in for a 
shock when after they have secured their top paying jobs, they 
discover that the world is dead, the ocean poisoned, the air ruined, and 
half of the world starving. They" 1 say " if I only would've known before 
it was too late. People here are overly concerned with their own im-
mediate and future personal happiness. They should attempt to look at 
things from a worldly perspective . . 

Most stupents study here sO that they can help themselves get ahead 
after gtaduation. I plan to use my education to help others . What are 
you achieving by going to law school other than insuring yourself 
future wealth? Living at a university isolates students from the outside 
world. We live quite a sheltered life here. The world 's pressing 
problems get ' little time for thought or discussion because most 
students must attend to their homework all the time . 

What is necessary to get people involved in social problems, politiCS, 
pollution , and poverty? People deserve whatever happens when they 
decide not to take any part in their government, or society and its ills . 

The issue of mandatory or volun tary fees is a prime example of this 
school's apathy. Only 35% of the student body cared enough to vote 
on an issue that will affect all of us here at UCSD. I do not see too 
many deep, personal relationships between men and women, professor 
and student, and person with friend . For some reason people are afraid 
to get involved with anything other than a school book . 

This letter is meant to stir reaction and hopefully some persons will 
show their gumption and take the time to get involved . Helping 
anyone other than one's se lf i~ very rewarding. I f you completely 
disagree with what I have said , write a rebuttal to my letter. I hope I 
draw some reactions from both .s ides. Ac tion can prevent the imminent 
destruction of the ea rth . but we must act now.

Student Warns of Danger of Y!\F Propaganda 
by Bob Novak 

While waiting for my Econ 2C 
lecture to start last Thursday, a 
tudent went LIP and down the 

dls les passing out folders, one of 
which I received . Opening it up, I 
found many pieces of literature. 
I t turned out to be propaganda 
for the Young American for 
Freedom, an extreme right-Wi ng 
conservative group . Reading 
through their propaganda , I 
found it filled With insults , 
hypocrisy, ignorance, miscon-
ceptions and militamm. 

The first thing I saw as I opened 
the fo lder was a pamphlet with 
the Question , "Are you old 
enough to make your own 
decisions?" It is very insulting to 
question people's maturity when 
they are making the transition 
into adulthood . It's a common 
tr ick among propagandists to 
catch a young adult's attention by 
doubti ng hi s maturity . This 
pamphlet dealt with student fees, 
and the YAF's view that they be 
vo luntary The pamphlet praised 
the freedom of choice in paying 
the fees, but where was my 
freedom when thi folder 'of 
propaganda was forced upon me? 

Looking through their other 
pamphlets. I realized that the YAF 

is very concerned with the 
relationship between government 
and business . Their literature 
contained unceasi ng glorification 
of the virtues of complete and 
total free enterpri se and an InÂ· 
tense dislike for any form of 
gover nment interference . The 
YAF made several good points for 
the separation of government and 
bUSiness with regard to 
economics, but their argument 
cannot be ex tended to the 
separation of the two with regard 
to ecology (a lthough the Y AF 
~trongly asserts it can) . The free 
enterpreneurs (the heroes of YAF 
propaganda). are individuals who 
are out to maximize profits while 
minimizing costs. Steel 
manufacturer are not going to 
in tall anti -pollution equipment 
In their factories as this will raise 
their cost and lower their profits. 
This results in dirty, unclean air 
and a hazard to a city's populace, 
while ruin ing the view. The only 
way to prevent this is through 
gover nment intervention and 
regulation to protect the nation's 
environment and citizenry . UnÂ· 
iortunately, the YAF is too blind 
to see this, due to their complete 
intertwining of economics and 
political freedom , where the 

s l ighte~t bi t of gover nm ent 
regulation , for whatever purpose , 
is seen as the fi rst step to their 
10 5 of freedom . 

The folder also contained a 
pamphlet promoting a book by 
other young conservatives called 
"The Incredible Bread Machine." 
Thi book also extols the virtues 
of a free market and how it will 

~olve our problems. On the ba k, 
the pamphlet gives a short 
biography of the IX members 
who contributed to the book , 
their ages rangi ng from 2) to 26. 
Not one of them (count 'em, not 
one), has a degree in economicsl 
How can they expect us to 
believe in the book's cred ibility 
when Its authors have none? And 
as if to make up for this 
deficiency in credibility, they list 
several endorsements by con-
servati ve economics professors, 
Including our own Daniel Orr 
(who in the late 60 s found 
himse lf at odds with the left wing 
SDS) . I fail to see how economics 
professors can give a book on 
economics credence when it has 
none to begin with . 

The YAF propaganda also dealt 
With politics and the individual. 
One of their pamphlets pointed 
out how well known American

So I continued on and on and 
on . Struggling, sweating, suffering 
through all the courses wi th 
which those in the game learn to 
know so well : O . Chern, Biochem, 
Physi ca I Bioc hem, Genetics , 
Mole Bio, Cell Bio, Labs, and 
more . Some turned out well, 
others, well, not so well . MeAT 
once , MCAT twice, applications, 
anxiety, phone calls, transcripts, 
letters of recommendation, fees, 
research , 199, T A, extracurricular 
this and that, and then waiting, 
wai ting, waiting, waiting . 

Acceptances began to trickle 
in . But not for me.

Smiles and heartfelt best wishes

me . Should it have been

Then one fi ne evening I ca lled

" Dear Mr. Hirsch, it is a 
pleasure to notify you ...... 

Thank you , masked man . 

â¢ * * 

I write to you now from the 
very euphoric position of one 
who has been accepted and can 
relax a bit now that one race is 
over . Bu t I bear the scars of being 
a pre-med. The Struggle is uphill , 
difficu It and sometimes almost 
hopeless . This I know. I feel it is 
my obligation to suggest to all 
duty bound pre-meds some 
thoughts on the subject of The 
Struggle which must religiously 
be adhered to to avoid permanent 
paralysis of the mind and to 
prevent pu trification of one's 
individuality . They were, quite 
honestly, essential to my own 
survival. 

Declaring oneself a premedical 
student does not give one the 
liberty of shutting off the rest of 
the world and the people in it 
There is more to life than the 
Krebs Cycle and more to people 
than a CPA . It is quite easy to 
ignore everything excep t one's 
books and one's chances for an A 
In Smith's 110B 

I doubt very much if there is so 
readily available on " the outside" 
such a wide variety of ex-
perien ces and possible en -

counters with ideas, knowledge, 
and people as there is here. It is 
incumbent upon all of us to seek 
them out, to use them , to enjoy 
them , to make them our own . 
Four years go by fast. If the only 
accomplishment one has been 
able to achieve is acceptance to 
medica l school , then I consider 
the four years that person spent 
here a waste. THERE IS MORE TO 
LIFE THAN GODDAMN 
MEDICAL SCHOOL ! 

The decision to become a 
doctor is both a difficult and 
noble Â·one. Associated with that 
decision is the knowledge that 
the future holds much hard work 
and se lf-sacrifice . But it can not 
be lISed as an excuse for 
developing a philistine outlook. 
There is too much to enjoy, 
contemplate, and do. Do not lock 
yourself up in a library. 

At the risk of becoming 
unreadably saccharine, I will end. 
I beg all of us not to forget : 

-- the beauty of a sunset viewed 
from the cI iffs, 

-- the profound revelation 
which art and poetry can give, 

--the inner peace music can 
provide, 

--the thrilling feeling of love, 
and 

--t he sound of one hand 
clapping.

inventors (Edison, Ford and ihe 
Wright Brothers ) used their 
" INDIVIDUAL initiative to solve 
problems" The pamphlet seems 
to be making a case against 
public protests as it derides those 
who lobby, politic, demonstrate 
and demand to chan ge things 
Like good conservatives, they're 
trying to de-fuse all potential 
oPPOSition to the government in 
order to malnta in law, order and 
the status quo by using the in-
dividual achievements of other 
Americans as examples . 

A scientist, working alone , can 
olve a science-related problem . 

But one ci tizen cannot 
Inglehandedly solve problems 

regarding the nation and society . 
Would the US government have 
withdrawn from Vietnam a few 
years ago if I had written the 
President telling him to do Sol Of 
course not. Solutions to problems 
dealing with the welfare of the 
nation and its citizens requi res 
massive, and violent protest If 
necessary, against an intransigent 
government. The YAF is at-
tempting to deceive and divide 
the opposition to keep it 
disorganized because they realize 
that a united opposition will force 
changes. 

Continuing along the political 
views of the YAr , I realized that 
they pose a threat to world peace 
and order and the very eXistence 
of the human race On the back 
of the first pamphlet I mentIOned 
is an article cal led "The Sharon 
Statement," which IS the creed of 
the Y AF . I t lists several POI nts, but 
the last thre are th most 
seriOus, being "That the forces of 
International Communism are, at 
present, the greatest single threat 
to these liberties , that the United 
States should stress victory over, 
rather than coexistence with, this 
menace; and that American 
foreign policy must be judged by 
thiS cri tenon- does it serve t!le 
just interests of the United 
Statesr' 

Let me point out that the 
Sharon Statement was adopted In 
1%O! I t IS completely Irrelevant 
in 1975 . This is cold war policy 
that IS outdated (alt hough 
conservatives won' t admit It). The 
greatest proof that It's outdated IS 
the recent fall of South Vietnam 
to the Communists . After )0 years 
of fighting the colonialist French 
and the Imperialist Americans, 
the Vietnamese have finally 
succeeded i n freeing their

Paco's a goddam, lazy pig, with his white be II bottom and paunch. 
He fucks up in the clutch, can be coun ted on to send the ball high Just 
as his opponent wavers. He also hasn't made any money for anybody in 
two years. 

But, Paco knows all thiS, which makes him the only player in the 
whole Jai Alai Palace with class . 

That's it. That's the co lumn. Fooled you, huh. Well , that's the way it 
goes in this game, never let them know what's coming. Keep 'em on the 
edge. A little constipation during Mass. 

Speaking of Mass, the only bit I can remember is the ushers' smiles 
during collection, the first one . That and the idiot Dominican who tried 
to recruit me to a seminary. That priest played the piano and I think he 
stole wine from the cellar for dates with the Chi Ro Club president's 
mother I didn't go to thE! seminary . I went to pot. 

Greg, the red-haired demon, keeps handing me these bongs . 
"Take thiS , take this . just one more. It's good and healthy and you' ll 

wake up re-freshed in the morning." He told me that last night, and this 
morning I felt like shit . But, he's sticking the bong in front of my nose. 
Well , OK Greg, you're such a man. (Where's the match?) 

" I fall to pieces ... each time you call my name." (That's what Linda 
sa ng to me last Saturday night. That true to life experience will be re-
lated in a forthcoming "Wipe With This .)" 

Now back to matters at hand. Speaking of hands ... 1 used to be 
enthralled with looking at guys' crotches. But, finally, I gave up 
wishing I was hung bigger, because if I was I'd then need a bigger hand. 

Oh, Tony s.ays he don't think they're gonna print this because it's 
garbage. G-A-R-B-A-H-j . Garbarj . As in Maharish i. 

So, the way things WERE goin' to go, Paco, it turns out, is bet on by 
all these stupid Americanos. They don't know their ass from a whole in 
the wall.

Traditionalist 
Among the 
Avant-Garde 

by Daniel Shawle, 
Staff Writer 

Contrasti ng the avant-garde faculty of the UC San 
Diego music department is the Violin and bow of 
ProfeHor Rafael Druian, a man With a very 
tradl teonal mLlslcal background 

Drulan. hailed once by the New York H raid as "a 
Violinist of first rank, " was born In Vologda, Russia , 
In 1922. One year later his famely relocated in 
Havana. uba, where he star t d his violin studies . 
In 1931. after moving to Philadelphia, Druian 
,!uditioned for Leopold Stokowski , and was 
recommended to the Cu rtis Institute of Music. 
While at the Institute, Druian studied under Lea 
Luboschultz and Efrem Zimbalist 

After the war Druian became the concertmaster 
of the Dallas Symphony. In 1949, he took the same 
pos ition with the Minneapolis Symphony In 1960, 
he became the concertmaster of the Cleveland 
Symphony under the baton of George Szell , a 
po Ition he retained until 1971 when he became the 
concertmaster of the New York Philharmonic . 

Among Innov~tors 
From there, Druian went on to become a member 

of the music faculty at this school in the role of 

Druian appreciates need 
for experimentation 

traditionalist among innovators . It was precisely 
this reason , he says, that brought him to the UCSD 

Although he has nothing to do with the avant-garde 
,lpproach of the music department, Druian ap-
precia te the need for an experimental approach to 
mUSIc. Druian maintains that while there may not 
be many good works because of the experimental 
nature of avant-garde music , the benefits that come 
trom the better work 5 are certainly of valtle. 

UCSD Professor Druian, former New York 
Philharmonic concertmaster. 

tradl tionallyoerformed concert music by records and 
tapes . He feels heavy reliance upon the recorded 
media In place of live performances is a mistake, 
although Druian admits that an area such as San 
Diego doe not offer much in the way of quality live 
performances. Professor Druian says "a live per-
iormance will vary in intensity. A recording will 
never vary . It will lose its flavor." 

In his role as a teacher. Druian is disappointed In 
the construc tion of the Mandeville center. He says 
its facilities are " totally inadequate, " for not only is 
there a lack of rehearsal and practice space, but 
much of what there is is handicapped by the loud 

Recorded sound: 
too easy to fake through 

rumble of the air cond itioning system. (His office in 
the Mandeville center is a perfect example. The 
f'ver present noise is so loud that it can actually 
cause iatigue In a short while)

Drulan much preferred the old facilities on

quieter and more conducive to music. Having never

could not make any comments on their quality . 
However, calling upon his experience as a lectu rer 
In the reCital hall , Druian did offer the suggestion 
that the nOISY risers on which the chairs are placed

Is now on displaY the hills surrounding UC San

Art 
I did pull myself away from the outdoors to catch

A Strange - Initia~ion to Biking 
by Scott S.dil 
Staff Writer 

Perched on my 11-yellr-old ten-
speed, I nervously listened to the 
starter give the final pre-race 
instructions. Was I crazy to be 
here? These guys around me 
really look serious. Look at their 
outfits. Each one has on those 
special cycling shoes with the 
holes all Qver them. And racing 
shorts. And some are wearing 
helmets. My God! Was the 
competition going to be 50 in-
tense that such a precaution was 
necessary? I thought this was a 
bike race, not the Indy 500! 

And the bicycles these guys 
have. I haven 't seem 50 many 
foreign words since my tenth-
grade German class . And there 
isn ' t a spot of rust on any of them . 
I wouldn't be surprised if both 
brake worked on everyone of 
those bikes 

Somehow I feel out of place. A 
~urf-shi rt and hurraches just don't 
~e m to be fitting. And my bike 
So mu h rust. And all of those 
broken pokes . And the cut brake-
cable tied in a bow around the 
hand1 bars. At lea t there is no 
way that anyone ca n tell that only 
four of my gears are of any use. 
Oh well, I thought to myself . I've 
come this far. I might as well go 
through with this thing. 

Feel for Sport 

This "thing" was the men's 
divis ion for UC San Diego 
students at the cycling cham-
pionships held Saturday north of 
the Central library . This race 
preceeded the Southern 
California Intercollegiate Cycling 
Championships held later that 
day. I had entered my race to get 
a better feel (ala George Plimp-
ton) for a sport to which my 
closest previous contact had been 
my daily leisurely two-mile ride to 
and from school. Before returning 
to the details of my illustriOUS 
cycling debut, allow me to fulfill 
the requirements of my 
profession and report on the 
other events of the day. 

In the featured. Â·,."collegiate 
race, UCSD, led bf ffCond place 
finisher larry Railden, captured 
the team championst\ip against a 
very limited field of competition. 
The race, 25 laps ilround the 1.4-
mile course that included a steep 
200-meter uphill pun, was ex-
tremely close from surt to finish . 
rour cyclists, ~Ploying the 
drafting technique. broke away 
from the field of fifteen entrants . 

Drafting enaf.>les a group of 
riders to go faster than singles 
because only the leader of the 
pack has to fight the wind . The 
other cyclists are pulled along 
and can conserve strength. By 

} immy WaJker, winner in the 
intercollegiate men's division . 

continually changing the lead 
throughout the members of the 
group, the entire group can make 
better time. 

Th lead pack stayed together 
for the entire 35 miles of the race 
a'nd it was simply a question of 
who had the strongest sprint at 
the end in determihing the 
winner . Jack Mauck, last year's 
lunior state spring champion from 
Santa Monica ce, had the kick to 
win . Following VCSD's Rairden 
were Michael Hoshko and Paul 
Freman , both from San Diego 
State . By what seemed to be 
spontaneouslv derived scoring-

~ystem, n cessary because of the 
hortage of most team 's 

representation, UCSD was 
declared the team Champion . 
rifth place finisher Brooks 
McKinney of UCSD was, I think, 
the determining finisher. 

I n the women's intercollegiate 
race, Hannah North of Mesa 
College out-rode the only other 
member of the field, UCSD's Julie 
Coakley . 

I n another two-woman contest, 
the race open to female UCSD 
students, Michele Kinyon 
defeated Nancy Blachman. 

Not So Su.re 
As I mentioned earlier, my 

cycling experience is limited. 
However, Friday night: in a fit of 
athletic and journalistic 
dedication, I decided I would try 
my luck. After an extra half-hour 
of Yoga practice, a 9:30 pm bedÂ· 
time, and a healthy breakfast of 
yogurt, Crar>enuts, and raisins, I 
felt I was ready . Later on , sitting 
at the tarting line, I wasn 't quite 
ure. 

Before I cou ld chicken-out, 
however, the race began . In a 
flurry of writhing posteriors we 
were off. Half way up the steep 
hill I realized that this really was a 
serious sporting event As I 
reached the top of this grueling 
climb I thought to myself, " Hey, 
wait for me!" as by now most of 
the other qclists were strung out 
far ahead of me. As I struggled 
alone the back straight-away a 
dreadful thought occurred to me. 
might finish last!Â· Could my 
athletic pride take such a blow? 

U,CSD won the team championship in very limited comÂ· 
pelttlon. 
At the end of the first lap (the maybe, I could hold on for 

race was scheduled for three) I another lap. I continued . 
glanced behind me. I was still 
ahead of some riders . But as I was 
eHortiess ly passed by two cyclists 
on the hill , I realized that maybe I 
had worked too hard at the 
beginning and everyone else 
would be strong at the finish . 
Already I was pooped. I seriously 
considered continuing straight on 
old Highway 101 to escape this 
event that was threatening to 
destroy my last ounce of self-
confidence 

But a vision of George Plimp-
ton climbing up a ladder to the 
take-off platform after having just 
fallen head first Into a net 
becau e he could not complete 
the Imple trick of swinging on a 
trapeze, spurred me on 

Just before ending my second 
lap, I noticed that my back tire 
was flat Here was my chancel A 
graceful wi thdrawal because of 
mechanical difficulties. A sound 
excuse. But there was still one 
rider behind me. Maybe, just 

.,.. 
,j.J.JJ~ ,} . .J}J) 

I toiled up that damned hill. 
Legs throbbing, heart pounding. I 
strained along the back-stretch, 
then down Genessee and into the 
home-stretch. Was I going to do 
It? No. One hundred yards from 
the end I was passed . As I crossed 
the finish-line I was given a pitiful 
courtesy applause by a few 
spectators and I tfled to smile to 
h ide my disappointment 
Someone laughed at me and 
made a comment about my 
deflated tire I was too dejected 
to ay anything back . But then, It 
happened Casually pedaling 
toward the finish-line was another 
entrant He looked like he had 
lust finsihed a short Sunday ride 
But that meant I hadn' t lost the 
race I hadn' t lost! I had beat him ! 
Ah, the thrill of competition . It's 
good to be alive . 

By the way, Jimmy Walker was 
the winner of this race Erick 
Macy finished second and Dan 
Crane was third I have no idea 
how close a race it was .
