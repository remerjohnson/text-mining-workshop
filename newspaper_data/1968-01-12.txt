Chancellor Galbra.ith and Norman Foster discuss the new Central 
University Library, to be constructed soon. 

A.S. lerkeley 
Heyns' Act 

The AS Senate of UC Berkeley 
Tuesday night approved a strong-
ly worded attack () n their chan-
cellor, Roger Heyns. 

In an exclusive interview with 
Senate correspondent for the 
"Daily Californian," Steve 
Duscha, the Triton Times learned 
of the action, which is in response 
to the chancellor's action of re-
voking financial control over AS 
operations from the Senate. 

Attacked 
incorporated aSSOCiation, the ac-
tion will be found illegal by the 
courts." (The Alameda County 
Courts probably hold jurisdiction 
over such matters, Duscha said.) 

The resolution states that the 
"transCer of authority" of finance s 
relates to the " stop-the-draft week 
activity of last quarter. Duscha, 
however, said that this is not 
true, since the two controversies 
are separate issues. 

"The ASUC is prepared to take 
all the nessary legal action to 
protect the student body's inter-
ests," the resolution concludes. 

Duscha reported that the Sen-
ate has challenged Chancellor 
Heyns to debate the action and the 
suspension of students last qllarter 
on Monday (Jan.1 5), and that he 
will mo:;t like ly accept.

The administration's action cen-
ters around the question of whe-
ther graduate students may vote in 
AS elections. ot since 1959, Du-
scha said, have they been allowed 
to vote, because they did not pay 
the compulsory AS fees. In the 1967 
Spring Quarter, the AS Judicial 
Committee ruled that the graduates 
have been deprived of their voting 
rights ever since Clark Kerr!s 
(then chancellor of Berkeley) ru-
ling. The graduates were asked to 
indicate their opinions in a special 
election, and only a bare majority 
voted to join the AS. A two-thirds 
majority was needed. In an article printed in the Los

UCSD Library To Be 
Center Of Fanfare 

While Berkeley celebrates its 
100th anniversary this yea, UC-
SO will have its own celebration 
as the University Librar y begins 
to take physical shape north of 
Revelle and Muir Colleges. 

Lieut.-Gen. A. L. Bowser, coor-
dinator for the campus' centennial, 
announced that the formal cere-
monies will begin on Jan. 28, (Sun-
day) with a no-host luncheon, spon-
sored by the Friends of the Li-
brary, a citizen-group interested 
in a major research library on 
campus. 

Mr. A. I.Dickman, president of 
the group, will outline the library 
program, while Bowser will talk 
on the university's role in the 
centennial celebrations. which 

"will center exclusively around 
the Central Library." 

ot yet named, the library will 
begin construction about April 1, 
according to the Dept. of Archi-
tects and Engineers, and reach 
50% completion by the end of the 
year. Bob Davis of A E estim-
ated the completion date to be 
"mid-I970," but actual operations 
will probably not begin until the 
end of that year, because of the 
moving and cataloging of books 
which would take place during the 
summer. 

"By the end of 1968," Bowser 
said, I, the combined libraries on 
campus will contain at least half 
a million volumes. We have a goal 
of I million within five ytlars, al-
though twice that many would be 

Loyalty Oath Revised, 
Cunniningham Rules 

The University of California at 
San Diego last week received a 
vital announcement from the Chan-
cellor's office deeming a portion 
of the California Loyalty Oath 
Invalid. The content oC the Chan-
cellor 's memorandum was a dis-
patch Crom Mr. Thomas J. Cun-
ningham, Vice-President and Gen-
eral Counsel of the Regents. 

In this dispatch, the Regent gave 
the following proclamation: 

"The loyalty oath form is set 
forth on the reverse side of the 
University Employment Form. The 
second paragraph of the form 
(commencing with the words' And 
I do further swear (or affirm) 
that I do not advocate' and con-
tinuing through the words 'or other 
unlawful means') can be deleted by

possible. The total number of vol-
umes to be available at the Cen-
tral Library is now expected to be 
3 million." 

The key phrase dlJring 1968, 
Bowser said, will be bequests. 
"We are looking for bequests of 
books and mO'ley tu purchase books 
from all sources. Even students 
are urged to give their collections, 
and to ask grandparents and aunts 
and uncles to bequeath their li-
braries. Students and parents are 
all members of organizations, 
which could each donate a book to 
UCSD's library." 

During 1968 Friends of the Li-
brary, who ma~e a IOannualcon-
tribution for privileges at the Ii-
brary, will hold open house s at the 
R-L Library, all open to parents 
and friends of students. 

"We hope students will parti-
Cipate in these activities," Bow-
ser said. "They would be encour-
aged to provide musical enter-
tainment and tours of the campus. 
We need help in addressing 5000 
brochures on the progress of the 
library." 

The Central Library has been 
part of UCSD's master plans ever 
since Chancellor Galbraith threat-
ened to resign in 1965 if the 
Regents did not reinstate tbe li-
brary in the plans. The facility 
will serve researchers, primarily, 
with a balanced collection of hu-
humanities- and science-oriented 
books. 

"As you know, the State Loyalty 
Oath in the form prescribed by the 
California Constituti n is required 
of all University employees (except 
aliens) pursuant to Article XX, 
section 3 of the California Consti-
tution, and Government Code, sec-
tions 3100-3\09 (the' Levering 
Act '). The law further provides 
in effect that no compensation shall 
be paid for services performed 
prior to taking the Loyalty Oath.

fornia Supreme Court in the case 
of Vogel vs. County of Los Angeles

Court did not invalidate the entire 
Oath. Rather, the Court held in-

'S Prophet's 
food Palat.a&'e? 

The innumerable problems that 
the Prophet Food Co. is having in 
providing adequate food service 
are becoming quite apparent to 
those unfortunate students who find 
it necessary to consume their 
daily meals at the Re ve lie or 
Matthews Cafeterias. Last spring, 
after the completion of a dismal 
year both for students and the 
Prophet Co., spokesmen for the 
latter lamented the fact that much 
cheating had occurred with an 
open cafeteria. Now, in spite of 
the fact that the cafete ria has 
been closed for one complete quar-
ter, the quality of food service, 
far from improving, has declined 
in many respects, as an informal 
sampling oC student opinion re-
veals. 

One finds that in an attempt 
to give the student less of the 
main entree whlle seeming to give 
him more, Prophet has resorted 
to tactics of camouflage and dis-
guise. Upon examining a large 
scrumptuous- looking piece of Ra-
violi, the students find a poor, 
lonely, dejected, shriveled-up 
piece of meat hidden in the deep 
dark caverns of its starchy out-
s ide covering. On another night 
the student is quite disappointed 
to find that his chicken casserole, 
although abounding in peas and 
potatoes, contains, on the average, 
merely 2 1/ 2 pieces of chicken 
per ser ving. Let it be hoped that 
such tactics of dilution have not 
fooled the intelligent, thinking 
UCSD student. 

Another phenomenon of late is 
Prophet' s inability to provide stu-
dents with the "basic essentials" 
of eating, i.e., silverware, plates, 
and glasses. Oh how lucky is the 
person who is actually able to ob-
tain a fork, knife, and spoon - at 
the same time, even! The plastic 
substitutes would often be suffi-
cient, but when one comes up 
against the likes of the "Swiss 
steak" of last week, even the dur-
able dinner knives are a poor 
match. Not only must we use 
paper cups, but we must endure 
such commercial announcements 
as "Try San Diego County First!" 

In several other ways the ser-

vice has declined recently. To 
those of us who are milk drinkers, 
bliss is pushing the milk button 
and seeing real milk come out be-
Core our own eyes. How many 
others of us have waited for salad, 
catsup, or other items? The sand-
wich line, immensely popular last 
year, has become merely a fond 
memory to those of us who are 
braving it through anothe r year of 
Prophet Food. We also remember 
the good old days when Prophet 
used to proudly display its menu 
on the "marquee," so that we 
could at least tell what we were 
eating, or at any rate, what they 
were calling it that day. 

Before this vendetta against 
Prophet Co. comes to an end and 
the enemy Is forever laid to rest. 
let us, in all fairness, commend 
Prophet for some of its success-
ful innovations and efforts to im-
prove its overall food service. No 
one can ever go hungry with the 
varied offering of the bullet that 
has been added this year (we 
might get trampled, though). Pro-
phet nutritional experts have been 
kind enough to provide us with 
a lovely fresh green salad and not 
one, but two fresh vegetables daily. 
Furthermore, no one can say that 
they are stingy with their dese rts; 
one can make a meal out of the 
ice cream and apple pie il he is 
desperate enough. And last, but 
not least, we must thank the Pro-
phet Co. for providing us with so 
many lovely girls to se rve us our 
food (an obvious attempt to take 
our minds off the food we are 
getting, but we appreCiate it any-
way). 

In conclusion, we are not openly 
condemning you, Prophet Co., or 
accusing you of a deliberate at-
tempt to deceive the students. We 
try to syrr.pathize with you and 
understand your problems, which 
we realize are numerous. As 
John Arbuckel said, "You get what 
you pay for," and wlth what we're 
paying we can't expect the best. 
However, we do feel that we de-
serve at least to be served edible 
and nutritious (if not delicious) 
fQOd, with efficient and suflicient 
se rvice.

YRs Sack 
Chancellor 
Galbraith 
Editor, the Triton Times: 

To prove that the Young Re-
publicans are not a " fascist" or 
reactionary organization, the fol-
lowing petition was passed at our 
Dec. 6th meeting: 

"we, the Young Republicans of 
the University of California at San 
Diego, condemn the flying of the 
Viet Minh flag In Revelle College 
Plaza in November, 1967, but we 
believe Chancellor John S. Gal -
braith has acted In the best in-
terests of the University and San 
Diego in refusing to disregard the 
law and suppress groups unfa-
vorable to his and our point of 
view. 

"This action on the part of 
a minority promoted an over-
whelming response from the ma-
jority ofthe University community, 
who, along with Young Republicans, 
abhorred the display of the Stu-
dents of the Independent Left. 

"We realize that these students 
n ew the Viet Minh Clag as a symbol 
of protest against the Johnson 
Administration's war policy, which 
we, too, question, but from a 
different point of view." 

The Young RepubUcans will con-
tinue to speak out when UCSD 
students are misrepresented on 
campus by the radical few .

Mock Election at Davis 
Editor, the Triton Times: 

A plurality of UC Davis students voting in a mock election favored 
a Rockefeller -Percy ticket over a Johnson-Humphrey ticket 8 to 1. 

The election sponsored by Davis Young Republicans. sampled 
student OPinion' on 1968's presidential race, the war in Vietnam, and 
the draft. . 

Out of five possible choices concerning the war, a plurality fa; vored 
Richard Nixon's proposal that if a ~enerous peace offer Is rejected, 
,.then (the U.S. should) use all force short oC atomic war to win." An 
unconditional pull out was close behind. 

On the draft, a large plurality favored an ultra-conservative Idea 
that the draft be abolished and a volunteer army be established, ac-
cording to Cotton. 

Sixteen hundred of Davis' ten thousand students voted in the election 
and they were probably a good sampling of student opinion. 

Asked to state political party preferences, 48% of those voting de-
clined to state, whUe 26.4% favored the Republican and 25.6~c the 
Democrat parties. 

in choosing a national ticket, voters favored President Johnson 
over Nixon by a narrow margin, and Gov. Reagan by a 2 to I margin, 
but they supported Sen. Charles Percy, R-Ill., and Gov. Rockefeller 
by substantial margins over LB.J. 

On the other hand, a Kennedy-Fulbright ticket would defeat both 
a Nixon-Reagan and Rockefe ller-Percy combination, although only by 
28 votes in the latte r case. 

Davis students seemed to oppose the administration's present 
Vietnam policy, since only 87 made that option. The proposal by 
John Kenneth Galbraith to "de-escalate, and withdraw to a few defen-
sive positions in the South," rated third out of the five choices. At 
the bottom of the list only 61 favored an unlimited use of American 
force, "atomic bombs included," to achieve military victory. 

Finally on the draft, only 51 students favored an end to student 
deferments and 71 favored abolition of the draft and disbanding of the 
armed force s. 

The actual tally of all votes is as follows : 
I. On men preferred for the presidency,

Meet Third 
College Provost 

Dr. Armin Rappaport, Provost 
of the Third College and acting 
head of the History Department 
is an energetic and enthusiastic 
man, especially so when the Third 
College or United States diplo-
matic history is involved. Despite 
the fact that he has been engrossed 
in his teachin~, (previous to coming 
to UCSD he taught for many years 
at Berkeley) he is the widely re-
spected author of several books on 
diplomatic history in the United 
States • 

Last Thursday Dr. Rappaport 
gave his inaugural lecture titled 
"The United States Faces a ew 
Europe". He describe s the lecture 
as a jus tification and introduction 
to the book he plans to write 
covering the period since World 
War II. Contending that there has 
been an emergence of a new unified 
Eu rope on the ruins left by World 
War II, he states that this Is "one 
of the most momentus events of 
the 20th century - ranking with 
the Russian Revolution and the 
victor y of the Communist Chinese 
on the mainland". 

The European Economic Com-
mllOity began a 12 year plan in 
1957 which will be complete ahead 
of schedu le in July of this year. 
Dr. Rappaport believes that a 
European Community will in the 
future "becomg a prime major 
competitor in eve r y market in the 
world - including our own domestic 
market." 

The inaugural lecture is a Euro-
pean cu stom adopted by some U.S. 
colleges in which each full profe s-
sor speaks about his prime in-
terest. The UCSD Inaugural Lec-
ture Series, begun this yea r, pro-
mises many more outs tanding lec-

tures. 
Concerning the Third College 

Dr. Rappaport expects a greater 
fie xibility in course requ ire ments 
and hopefully, decreased emphasis 
on finals in every course every 
quarter by the use of thorough 
comprehensive exams after the 
completion of the year. The less 
rigid graduation requirem ents will 
also allow a S~nior to pursue a 
large scale research project in his 
major field. 

Part of Dr. Rappaport's charm 
is his energy and good health 
which come, in part, from daily 
swim sessions--maybe he also 
eats Chee rios! Dr . Rappaport is 
impatiently waiting for the new 
gym to open so that he can use 
the squash courts. Let's hope they 
are nice and strong to stand up to 
the heavy use they will get.

The Students of the Independent 
Left (SIL) are attemptin g a "poli-

Official Letter Discusses 
Cafeteria Alternatives 

In a letter addressed to the 
members of the University com-
munity, the status of the cafeteria 
was discussed and some back-
ground into the situation provided. 
Although the University is still ex-
ploring all possible alternatives, 
it has been decided that the im-
mediate re-opening of the cafete r ia 
is not feasible. 

In the two and a half years 
that the Prophet Company has 
operated the Commons, they have 
suffered a large financial loss. 
This has been attributed in large 
part to abuse by the students of 
their privllige to unlimited se -
conds , Besides the wasted or 
stolen food, theft of dishes and 
utensils has amounted to more 
than $6,000 .00 per year. In 
addition, Prophet Co. has had to 
pay excessive maintenance costs 
for seve ral things such as bussing 
dishes and trays fr om the pallo 
area and re-arranging tables for 
dances. Of cou rse there has 
also been a lack of efficient 
management at times, a problem 
which Prophet is now trying to 
overcome. 

Fa~ed with the task of feeding 
870 resident students on the Re-
velle Campus in 1967, Prophet 
changed their service from "open" 
a la carte to a "closed" ope ration 
which served only those who had 
meal tickets or would purchase a 
complete meal. ThiS, of course. 
discouraged the mixing of under-
graduates, graduates, and fac ulty, 
and led to a series of meetings 
of various committees as well 
as actual protest demonstrations, 
which sought to return to previous 
conditions. 

Faculty and Senate committees 
both passed resolutions supporting 

Building to St,,,,

Plans have now been completed 
for the new Revelle Provost's 
Office. The building will house 
offices for the Provost, four as-
sis tant deans, a psychologist, a 
clerical work room pIllS a recep-
tion lobby. 

Located centrally between the 
Humanities Library and the Barn-
door, the office will blend into 
the Univers ity campus. Construc-
tion on the glass and wood struc-
ture will begin in early February 
and be completed in the latter 
part of May. 

an Intensive effort to reopen the 
Commons . The Senate affirmed 
that the educational philosophy of 
the campus would best be served 
under such a system providing it 
could be accomplished within the 
bounds of economic feasibility . 
Since that time, the administration 
has investigated the s ituation anrl 
has founrl that Prophet's financial 
statement s were correct. They 
also solicited bids from other 
food service cont ractors and found 
none willing to take ove r the oper-
ation under an "open" system. 

Therefore, as the situation now 
stands , the cafeteria will remain 
closed until a sui table method 
of opening it is found. Since it 
is the resident students who must 
bea r the cost of operating the 
Commons facility, any solution 
which is proposed mllst meet with 

their approval. 
Several alternatives are cur-

rently being considered and will be 
presented to the resident udents 
for their vote in the near future. 
The first, of course, is to main-
tain the status quo. Another is 
to have an open facility at lunCh, 
with the sturlents forfeiting their 
seconds privilege for that meal 
only. There is also the pos-
sibility of maintaining an open 
facility at all times, with larger 
portions but no seconds. A plan 
now under study would involve an 
open a la carte facility in which 
resident stUdents would use coupon 
books and nonresidents cash. 

Among those wllo signed the 
leiter were AS President Rich 
AltenhoCC, Deans Murphy, Hull, 
and Batchelder, and Provosts Salt-
rnan and Stewart.

at the EI Cortez Hotel. (S .D.'s 
Mayor Curran demon trateda wild 
polka!). Under TV 8 coverage, our 
own advisor, Karin Friedrich, was 
crowned princess of the carnival. 
The Christmas celebration was a 
blast. Late one night all piled Into 

their cars and bombed down to a 
mad off-campus party (typical 
German). With all the lights out, 
a flam Ing punch was brewed of 
strange but stimulating Ingredi-

finally the German Christmas

makers discovered their shoe s, 
which had been lett outside, filled 
with goodies. 

This quarter (while at the same

unexplored avenues of escape are 
anticipated. Among other affairs,

News Must Go Through 
The front page is ready for 

the presses. All the stories are 
written and laid out. Then the 
Chance llor resigns. 

Since the Triton Times News 
Department must constantly be 
ready for the latest developments 
on campus, it is the most flexible 
department on the paper. 

At least a week before the paper 
is scheduled, the News Editor 
checks with his staff to assign 
stories , ranging from an inter-
view with Third College Provost 
Armin Rappaport to a sneak pre-

vi~w of th STU s sem l n3fs. The 

reporters then use all lIlanller 
of means to research their stories. 
The Publications Office often pre-
pares news releases for news-
papers outside UCSD, which the 
Triton Times prints. The Student 
Activities Office is also a major 
source for the latest developments 
on campus . 

Other than these official infor-
mation sources, reporters must 
rely on their own initiative and 
imagination to dig up the news. 

The most common approach is 
the use of " contact s. " 

Eventually thpre will be a news

bureau for each college, under 
the direction of a sub-News Edi-
tor. He will be responsible for 
all the news developments at his 
college, and have reporters to 
cover such events as lectures, 
research and college governme:Jt 
which deal only with his college. 

The News Editor in the Times 
office can then organize news ac-
cording to college and have a 
"chain of comml1ld" available to 
meet the pressing problems of 
an expanding paper. 

The Triton 'J'1mes needs re-
porter s to cover the increasing 
volume of news on campus. Al-
though no material reward or aca-
demic credit is possible at the 
present, the experience in handling 
news and meeting the fascinating 
personalities on campus will more 
than make up for any lost volley-
ball or library time. 

12 January 1968 page 4 

Newspaper 
Staff Concentrates 
on Student News 
Catering chiefly to the under-

graduate population of UCSD, the 
"Triton Times" has published a 
total of seven issues ove r the past 
two quarters and has grown to 
include 30 undergraduate mem-
bers. So that the "Times" starf 
doesn't remain a completelynebu-
lous body of people su rreptitiously 
banding together to produce a 
newspaper, we have decided to run 
this feature article on the "Triton 
Times" and show the plan we fol-
low every two weeks to bring you 
each edition. 

Because the UCSD campus does 
not yet maintain a journalism de-
partment, the "Times" has been 
completely independent in setting 
its own style and mode of opera-
tion. While a Communications 
Board does exist to "oversee" 
student publications, this body is 
largely advisory and plays only a 
small supervisory role leaving 
campus publications comparative-
ly free to decide their own policies. 

The "Time's" annual budget of 
$2250 which comes primarily from 
the AS Senate and the UCSD Vend-
ing Machine Board is allor.ated 
through this Communications 
Board. This figure means that 
approximately S90 is provided for 
each issue of the paper. In fact, 
however, the printing costs of each 
edition average $190 wtth other 
expenses pushing the tina 1 figure 
for one issue up to $300. In order 
to meet the $90 required by the 
budget the "Times" solicits ad-
vertising locally and through a 
national advertising agency and 
from these sources earns approxi-
mately two to three hundred dollars 
per edition. For the Fall Quarter 
the financial statement showed a 
free-and-clear profit of $250. This 
figure become s all the more signi-
ficant when it is noted that none of 
the alloted $90 per Issue was at 
any time used, leaving the 'Times' 
with total assets of $800 after one 
quarter of publishing. 

These profits have gone into 
more wd fi ner working materials 

for the newspaper staff and have 
resulted in the first color issue 
ever available to the students on 
this campus. In the near future it 
is expected that such profits may 
well go to syndicated columns and 
wider coverage of University of 
CaliIornia news. In addition, more 
effective methods of dlstrubuting 
campus newspapers are now being 
explored. 

In order to put the paper together 
every two weeks, approximately 
150 to 200 man-hours are required. 
While the more general concerns 
of the newspaper such as printer 
arrangements, recruiting and 
placement of the staff, reviewing 
of the news, etc., fall on the 
shoulders of the Editor-in-Chief, 
the news handling and departmental 
functioning of the staff is carried on 
primarily by the various depart-
ments; campus news, sports; 
social events, reviews and graphic 
arts. 

Each department is headed by an 
editor who is responsible for the 
assignment and completion of the 
department' s stories. ' 

As time continues , we expect 
to grow not only in the coverage 
of news but also in its interpre-
tation. Skil llu I journalism and 
thought-provoking essays about 
current affairs will be the main 
point of concentration now that the 
staff has been expanded and its 
machinery has become more es-
tablished. While some feel that 
the purpose of a campus news-
paper Is solely to preach the 
cause oC intellectualism and pure 
reason, the "Times" stall was 
moved to its organization beca use 
of a lack of practical application 
of Ideas not a lack of their abun-
dance. 

For those who are interested in 
the University which consumes the 
greatest part of their waking and 
sleeping day, and for those who 
are anxious to see a variety of 
dlIferent sides oC UCSD campus 
li!e, the Triton Times has dedi-
cated itself. 

The copy crew is the guts of 
any newspaper. They take a jum-
bled m:l.SS of articles and turn 
them into camera-ready pages, 
appearing exactly as they will 
In print. 

This process starts with the 

proofreade rs and a corps of wor-
ke rs (paid $1.83 per hour), who 
type out all the copy on a $10,-
000 typewr iter--the Justowriter. 
Typed words are turned into coded 
computer tape, which is placed 
in another typewriter to become 
articles with pe rfectly even col-
umns . 

Sports Builds Interest 
Advert isements 

Finance the Times 
Judging from a single copy of a 

newspaper, it is difficult to ima-
gine the cost, not only n mo.1etary 
fund s, but in the hour!. it takes to 
both seek out anrl compose the 
text as well as arran~ e and paste 
up the pages. The Adv' ;'tising De-
partment of the Time" must also 
search out its mater ,al to sup-
port the financial need ; to support 
the plans and ambition; of a grow-
Ing paper. 

Basing its format on the idea 
that a good looking anc easy read-
ing paper is unclutte r~d , the Tri-
ton Times attempts to supplement 
its news with the use of eye ap-
pealing ads. These ads provide 
the student with a variety ot local 
bu sinesses to patronize as well 
as to supplement the financial 
abilities of the paper. In addition 
to ads supplied to the Times by 
local merchants, national ad s such 
as IBM, Security Firhi National 
Bank, and Pratt and Whitney Air-
craft an~ included to also support 
the paper. 

Then the fun starts. The make-
up people try to fit the stories 
(and ads, and photos and cartoons) 
into the plan or " layout" of the 
paper. 

Simultaneously, headlines and 
captions are written and put into 
proper form. The captions are 
typed on the same machine as the 
copy, bu t the headlines are pro-
duced on a special machine, using 
a photographic process to print 
each letter In the desired ' style. 

At this point everything is run 
throu gh a waxing machine, so that 
It will ~lick te th" make-up sheets 
and allow for minor changes in 
position on the page. The articles 
and head lines--plus ads and other 
elements of a newspaper--are 
pasted onto the make-up sheets. 

Then, ten minutes late already, 
last minute corrections are made, 
and the editor-in-chief drives the 
twelve pages of completed news-
paper to the " Independent" in 
downtown San Diego. The copy 
sheets are turned into photographic 
plates , which are run off, cut, 
sorted, stacked; so that the next 
day at 9; 30 a.m., fr eshly printed 
"Triton Times" can be placed 
around the campus for your en-
joyment. 

And the mess int'le copy room ..•. 

In keeping with the expressed 
philosophy of the UCSD athletic 
department, the Sports staff of the 
Triton Times trie s to provide 
something for everyone. 

Comprehensive coverage, and as 
up to date as possible is the depart-
ment by-word, and often the sports 
copy is the very last to be printed, 
particularly if an event has re-
cently taken place. 

The sports editor is the man 
most responsible for the outcome 
of the Sports Department in the 
newspaper. He assigns the stor-
ies according to reporters' own 
Interests. He keeps track of com-
ing events so that scheduling of 
photographers can be made in ad-
vance. And he turns P.E. bul-
letins into entertaining shorts on 
facts and figures. 

Hopeful that the student body will 
continue their support of UCSD's 
growing sports program, the Tri-
ton staff attempts to relay game 
results and Interesting side lights 
of the varied athletic scene. 

Pictu res are given top prior-
ity, holding to the old cliche that 
a picture is worth a thousand 
words. 

The most Important factor in 
preparing the sports section is 
team work among the P.E. Dept. 
Working closely with the coaches 
on campus and meeting sports 
people from the local professional 
media make for a broader per-
spective on sports at UCSD. 

Working closely with the coaches 
on campus , and meeting sports 

people from the local professional 
media Is just another added attrac-
tion to the staff member. 

With continued response, and the 
present cooperation of staff and 
students, the Sports Department 
of the Triton Times can remain 
the students first link for UCSD 
sports coverage. 

This member of the paid student corps Is transforming typed copy 
into coded computer tape on the $10,000 Justowriter.

Narco Charge Queried 
In u.s. Court of Appeals 

WASHINGTON, D.C., Jan. 5 
(Liberation News Servlce)--Next 
month the second highe st court in 
the United States, the U.S. Court 
of Appeals, will review the consti-
tutionality of the Washington, D.C. 
law prohibiting the sale or pos-
session of marijuana. The D.C. 
law is almost Identical with laws 
in 47 states. 

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
District of Columbia, second only 
to the U.S. Supreme Court, has 
agreed to hear an appeal of the 
case of Steven V. Scott, who was 
arrested, tried and convicted under 
the D.C. law. 

Scott's attorney, Ira M. Lowe. 
is appealing on the grounds that 
the law unjustifiably includes 
marijuana under the headin~ of a 
"narcotic drug. II The lawyer con-
tends it is not a narcotic. ThUS, 
he argues, any conviction for pos-
session of marijuana under the law 
dealing with narcotics is a violation 
of the "due process" clause of 
the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. 
Constitution. 

In November of 1966 , Scott was 
stopped by the D.C. police. He had 
been drinking and was taken in by 
the police. During a search the 
vollce found marijuana in Scott's 
possession. 

Scott was charged and subse-
quently convicted and sentenced for 
possession of marijuana by the 
Court of General Sessions of the 
Distr ict. The few seeds found in 
Scott' s pocket were considered 
grounds for a misdemeanor and 

he was sentenced to one year on 
probation. 

The question raised by Lowe is . 
"whether or not a young man shall 
bear throughout his lifetime con-
victim of a serious charge of 
possession of narcotics when in 
fact he did not possess them." 

At Scott 's trial in 1966, Lowe 
introduced testimony from a de-
tecti 'e of the D.C. police nar-
cotics squad and a chemist from 
the Treasury Dept. confirming that 
marijuana is not a narcotic sub-
stance. In answer to this, the pro-
secuting U.S. Attorney said that 
although marijuana is not a nar-
cotic, the "fairly uniform approach 
of including marijuana in the defi-
nition oC 'narcotic drug' ltse If 
suggests the reasonableness of 
including marijuana in this clas-
sification. " 

The Chief of the Appellate Di-
vision of the U.S. Attorney's of-
fice, Frank Nebeker, contended 
that; "Congress can define nar-
cotic as it wishes •.• it is not the 
chemical definition that controls." , 
The arrestiug detective in the case 
has said that although' 'any eight-
year-old can go to a dictionary" 
to look up the definition of nar-
cotic, "We go on what Congress 
says it is." He agreed, however, 
that Lowe has a valid claim to ap-
peal the use of an arbitrary defi-
nition. 

Lowe's challenge to this reason-
ing is that " the judicial test of 
what is an unreasonable classifi-
cation was recently stated by the 
Suprer.le Court ••. ; 'The Courts

The basketball season is here 
in full force, and the UCSD SQuad 
is fighting in their first full var-
sity schedule. The season now 
stands at 5-6, with the majority 
of the season still to come. 

Starting strong, the Triton's 
seemed to be on their way in grand 
style after such big wins as their 
I-point victory over Cal State Ful-
lerton (whom San Diego State only 
beat by 4 points). But the season 
has its ups and downs and the 
Tritons were caught napping in a 
crushing loss to Occidental Col-
lege on the 20th of Dece mbe r, 
losing 114-72. John Thomas, pro-
bably UCSD's top man, had to s it 
out that game with a sprained 
ank Ie, and despite a valient effort 
by Blll Flatley anti the rest of the 
squad, Oxy was too overpowering. 

Putting that behind them, the 
Tritons participated in the Chris t-
mas Tournament held at UC Davis. ' 
Unfortunately, play was below par, 
and the Tritons weren't able to 
place. Against Davis the first night, 
UCSD was unable to find the win-
ning ingredient. Poise was sor e ly 
lacking, and ball control . was not 
good at al!. All in all, teamwork 
was substandard against Davis , 
and the Tritons lost 100-61. 

The second game was against 
Fresno Pacific, which was really 
no contes t. UCSD played only fair, 
but won easily, controlling the ball 
under the boards. The 3rd game 
was against Sonoma, and the Tri-

tons showed that they had learned 
little from the first game regard-
ing teamwork. Play was not good, 
and the Tritons lost the game by 
I point, 65-65. 

The first game of the new year 
saw UCSD against Pomona and 
winning 82-81. The Tritons seemed 
much better than in the Xmas 
Tourney, and this plus atewbreaks 
made the difference. 

Two nights later, the Tritons 
played their best game so far this 
season, and in spite of losing to 
Redlands 90-78, s howed a great 
deal of all-around balance not 
previously exhibited. Weak ti-
nishes seem to be the death blow 
for UCSD, and this was the case 
against Redlands . The game was 
tied 62-62 at the s tart of the 4th 
quarter, but UCSD was not able 
to keep up the pace of the other 
3 quarters . 

UCSD scored first in the game, 
and played their best firs t haIt 
to date. Thomas provided the start-
ing spark, and the press applied 
by the team forced some Red-
lands mis-cues. The Tritons were 
not as effectiVe with their shots 
as they are capable of, however, 
and the Bulldogs found the range 
from the outside . At the haU, it 
was Redlands 43, UCSD 41. 

Gary Schiller pres ented intra-
mural flag footba ll awards during 
half-time, with the men' s cham-
pionship trophy going to the Purple 
Gophers of the B League. 

At the start of the 2nd half, 
UCSD came on strong, and Bill 
Flatley began to find IUs shots 
from outside the key. 

There were a number of ques-
tionable calls by the r eferees dur-
ing the 2nd half for both sides, and 
at one point, the Redlands coach 
went onto the cou rt to protest a 
foul. 

Flatley helped keep the tempo 
for the Tritons, but the Bulldog 
center began to exploit a weakness 
up the UCSD center, and finished 
the game with an impressive 38 
points , most from directly under 
the bas ket. 

The schedule for the rest of 
January is rough. Occ idental is on 
tap again, and the UCR Tourney 
and the Cal Western game is mo'>t 
important. The team s hould really 
be up for the game against cross-
town rivals Cal Western. 

Tonight and tomorrow night will 
see the Tritons playing Southe rn 
Cal College, and Stanislaus State 
at La Verne , with the next home 
game scheduled against La Verne 
College the 19th. Southern Cal and 
Stanislaus should bring wins for 
the UCSD team, and if the team-
work and poise shown in the Red-
lands game can be carried over 
to these, they will be assured of 
vlrlnry.

Rugby, ofte n callt u ·· tackle foot-

running affair with plenty of hard 
action. Major differences set this 
game apart fr om both soccer and 
American football. 

DownCield blocking is illegal; 
in fact, no team me mber may be 
ahead of the ball carrier. U in 
trouble, he can pitch it backwards

illegal atall times . Lateralpassing 
is effective due to the great width

Rugby has no scrimmage or

is s topped, and cannot pass the 
ball to a teammate, he must re-
lease it, where it is automatically 
in play again.

Coach Walt Hackett is continuing plans for UCSD's first season 
of intercollegiate tackle football scheduled to get underway in the 
fall of this year. 

Bids are out for equipment, and a schedule Is being drawn up. The 
entir e idea is slightly beyond the planning stage, but there is still 
much that Is tentative. 

Along this same line, spring training is tentatively set Cor the 
last week in April and the first part of May. Approximately 20 days 
will be spent by the coaching staff for the purpose of reviewing 
prospective athletes. Hackett said that fundamentals will be stressed, 
but that at no time wlll practice take away from the student's study 
time. 

There has been an extremely encouraging response from the com-
munity towards the prospect of a team, both from the local sports 
and related activities. Hackett has followed up this response by 
naming two assistants; Chuck Millenbah as line coach, and Rich 
Johnson as the backfield coach. 

Coach Hackett brings considerable experience to UCSD. His first 
year as a coach (1950) saw him at Montebello High in L.A. He then The Rat Patrol? No. The Purple Gophers , champions at the sports awards night during half- time at the

The UCSD Surfing Club opened

on Sunday, Jan. 7. The Contest 
originally planned for La Jolla

The contest was sanctioned oy 
the Western Intercollegiate Surfing 
CounCil , and conducted according 
to the rules oC that organization. 
The preliminary heats, in which 
all team members compete, began 
at 9:30 A.M. At the conclusion 
of the pre Iimlnary heats, San Diego 
State led by only 46 points; 1933 
to 1887. Since team points are 
only accumulated during the pre-
liminary heats of surfing, the Tri- •

the paddlin~ race which was worth

was $OS 2047, UCSD 1887. in-

The trustees of the James 0, 
Phelan Awards in Literature and 
Art opened the 33rd competition 
this week, offering three prizes 
of $1000 each to California-born 
writers, from 20 through 40 years 
old, ot the novel, drama, and non-
fictional prose, 

Frederick Knott's tense Broad-
way drama, "Wait Until Dark", 
has heen adapted into a very sinis-
ter and terrifying motion picture 
of taut sUSlX'nse. Directed cannily 
by Terence Young, it features 
Au:1rey Hepburn as a young blind 
woman who finds herseU the near-
ly helpless victim of a trio of 
terrorists when a doll stuffed with 
heroin is passed on to her photo-
grapher-husband in an abortive 
double-cross attempt by a sexy 
smuggler. 

While he is lured away on a 
phony assignment, Miss Hepburn, 
in perhaps her most talented role, 
is left alone in her small New 
York apartment and soon heseiged 
by master criminal Alan Arkin 

FEI.EIER 

and his two accomplices who are 
determined to get their hands on 
the doll at all costs. Arkin, who 
is positively brilliant, plays a 
thoroughly repulsive psychopath 
who in a series of eerie dis-
guises menaces Miss Hepburn to 
a point of frantic terror. 

In an elaborately staged plot, 
Richard Crenna portrays the con-
fidence man who with his soothing 
voice convinces the you ng woman 
that he is an old Army buddy of 
her husbaJlu who can help the 
photographer out of a murder the 
three clever thugs have convinced 
Miss Hepburn he had committed. 
Crenna's clean-cut good looks 
make his gaining of the woman's 
confidence all the more chillingly 
credible . 

After a number ot tricks are 
played on the valiant, gentle woman 
who at fir st has no idea where the 
doll is, she suddenly rea lizes that

Television viewers wm be able 

to find out how much they know 
about cigarettes and why people--
including themselves-- smoke,

January 16 (10:00 - 11:00 PM, EST) 
in color on the CBS Television 

N~twork. CBS News Correspon-
dents Mike Wallace and Joseph 
Benti are the reporters. 

The test will be based on facts 
about cigarette smoking which have 
been public knowledge for some 
time and will be divided into three 
segments: (1) How You Feel About 
Smoking, consisting of statements 
with which te levision viewers--
smokers and non-smokers alike--
can agree or disagree; (2) What 
You Know About Smoking, a sec-
tion Involving true or false ques-
tions plus opinion-seeking queries; 
and (3) Smoke r'S Profile: Why You 
Smoke, which w1ll enable those 
taking the test to learn the motiva-
tions behind their smoking. 

Part 3 wili be based on the In-
sight Development Questionnaire 
developed by Dr. Daniel Horn for 
the Nationa l Clearinghouse for 
Smoking and Health. These ques-

why smokers continue to smoke , 
how the smoking habit is formed , 
how many persons actually do 
smoke, are all forms of smoking 
dangerous, what diseases are at-
tributable to smoking, etc.

as Noah. UCSDers seen at the 
first show included Chris Pendle-
ton and Joe Tulane. Cosby has a 
new radio program that is broad-
casted nightly at 6:25 on KCBQ. 

The first one-man show on the 
West Coast by artist Thomas Down-
ing opens on Friday, January 19, 
at La Jolla Museum of Art. 

The exhibit will include 29 paint-
ings by the Washington, D.C. artist 
representing Downing's work over 
the past five years. 

Thomas Downing is one of a 
group of artists known as the 
Washington Color Painters. The 
name co:nes trom the painters' 
use of geometric torms of pure 
color often placed on raw or un-
sized canvas. 

In 1965, Washington's Galleryof 
Modern Art organized an exhibition 
by the group which includes Down-
ing, Morris Louis, Kenneth Noland, 
Gene Davis, Howard Mahring and 
Paul Reed. 

Downing graduated from Ran-
dolph College and studied at the 
Pratt Institute and in Europe. In 
the mld-1950s, wile living in 
Washington, he came under the in-
fluence ot Kenneth Noland who was 
then his instructor at Ca holic Uni-
versity. 

At this time, another Washington 
painter, Morris Louis, was de-
veloping the use of brilliant acrylic 
colors applied to raw t-anvas. With 
Lou is began the poSt-l xpressionist 
paintings of the Washington Color 
group. 

Downing had his first New York 
one-man show at the Allen Stone 
Gallery in 1962. Important group 
shows in which his works have 
been included are: the Corcoran 
Biennial, 1963; the traveling ex-
hibition, tt Post Painterly Abstrac-
tion," 1964; the Museum of Modern 
Art's "The Responsive Eye," 1965 
and a one-man exhibition lalit year 
at the Corcoran Gallery in Wash-
ington. 

A lecture on the deve lopment of 
Downing's works and his recent 
directions will be offered on Tues-
day, January 23 at 10:30 a.m. 
In the museum galleries. 

Speaker will be James Harithas , 
friend and biographer to Downing. 
Harlthas is assistant Director of 
the Corcoran gallery and is its 
curator of modern art.

A seminar in Contemporary 
Revolutionary Theory is be ing con-
ducted on campus by the Students 
of the Independent Left. 

The non-credit, non-recognized 
class, which first met last night, 
seeks to explore the theories of 
twentieth century revolutionaries 
and consider whether they are 
relevant to a possible revolution 
of morals and attitude s in the 
United States, according to its ' 
first discussion leader, Lowell 
Bergman, a graduate student in 
philosophy at UCSD. 

"We realize that our demonstra-
tions in the Revelle Plaza have 
tended to be againstthings," Berg-
man explained. "We are against 
the Vietnam war, and discrimina-
tion of the black people . IT a revo-
lution comes about in the U.S., ' 
however, we must be prepared to 
offer something instead. The pur-
pose of this seminar is to think 
about problems In the US and to 
formulate what we want." 

The revolution Bergman refer-
red to would entail a complete 
change in US attitudes at homp 
and abroad. 

Cathy Merrill and Kathy Benson are getting ready for their jaunt to 
France next mO:lth. They will keep the Triton Times informed! 

Vive la France 
By Kathy Benson and Cathy Merrill 

Cathy Merrill and Kathy Benson, in an exclusive interview with the 
Triton Times, described their forthcoming jaunt to Paris. The two 
girls plan to spend spring semester al the Sorbonne, University o~ 
Paris, then travel through Europe by train. They were happy to give 
some tips for others who might be interested in such a trip. 

Within a few yearlj a UCLA scien-
tist expects to analyze a tiny piece 
of the moon for signs that life in any 
form eve r existed there. 
His sample of moon rock willde-

pend on the landing of the first 
Apollo astronauts on the moon and 
their planned return with some 50 
pounds of lunar material. 
"Most scientists believe that 

there is nC) life on the muon now," 
says Dr. Issac R. Kaplan, head 
oC the UC LA Biochemistry Labor-
atory. "But there is a chance that 
some organic matter, perhaps in 
a primaUve form and dating back 
to an early stage in the eVolution 
of the solar system, may have 
been preserved in the lunar crust." 
Dr. Kaplan will tr y to Isolate and 

measure isotopes of eLements in 
organic compunds, which are the 
basic identifying marks of all living 
matter. 

His investigation re lates to some 
fundamental Questions regarding 
the dim history of our part of the 
universe. How was the moon form-
ed, and whta was its original re La-
tionship tc) the earth and the solar 
system? What processes led to the 
evolution of living matter? Do bio-
logical organisms exists beyond 
the earth? 
Scientific competition for a piece 

of the moon will be rather fierce, 
with 110 investigators al ready se-
lected bv the NationaL Aeroilautir<; 

and Space Administration for the 
fir st round of experiments. The 
UCLA scientist hopes to receive 
several ounces and to exchance 
samples with other investigators. 

UCLA Scientists 

Perfo,,,, Grafts 
Artery grafts at the University of 

California at Los Ange le s have 
shown promise in treating high 
blood pressure associate d with 
poor blood supply to the kidneys. 
Drs. Joseph J. Kaufma:J and Pat-

rick J. Moloney of the UCLA Med-
ical Schoul have uesd grafts of syn-
thetic materials (usually dacron) 
to bypass plugged kidney ateries in 
17 patients. 
They report the grafts restored 

adequate blood supply and impro-
ved kidney function In 65 percent 
of the cases. or these, high blood 
pressure was cured in 59 percent 
of the pateint , Improved in 29 
percent, and not changed in only 
12 percent. 
Pieces of blood vessel removed 

from other parts of the patients 
own body make the best grafts , the 
UC LA surgeons point out. But 
vessels of the proper size are not 
r"ldily availablp. 

"We have already had a revolu-
tion to increase productivity of 
labor," he said. "Our society has 
become overly quantified because 
of this preoccupation with produc-
tion. Everything is stated in 
measurements. From the market 
place measurements have even 
gone to sex . We describe a woman 
by her measurements. Grade paint 
averages are the indicators of how 
much better one student is than 
another ." 

The requirement for the COUHS DE CIVILlZAflON FHANCAISE, 
the only course open to foreign undergrads, is a high school diploma. 
Fees for the semester are less than $50. Inform3tion regardin~ these 
courses can be obtained by writing the D'recteur de Cours DE Civiliza-
tion Francaise a La Sorbonne, Universite de Paris, France . Schools 
in France are crowded , so applic tions must be submitted early-
Kathy and Cathy wrote to the Sorbonne requesting admission for the 
February semester in early December to insure their acceptance. 

Housing is another problem in Paris. There is an office in New 
York, sponsored by the French Government, which exists solely to 
assist stUdents in locating rooms in Paris. This is the Office Du 
Tourisme Univer sitaire et Scolaire, located at 972 Fifth Avenue, 
New York, N. Y. 10021. Most students live in inexpensive hotels, where 
rooms can be obtained for about $2 a day. Student dormitories are 
open to foreign students only during the summer. 

Be rkeley Leads · in 
Ph.D. Produetion 

The American compulsion to 
quantify everything, he said, has 
reached the home, as well. 

"The family has become not 
much more than a filling station. 
You go home to eat and leave again. 
In human relations this has hap-
pened because of the necessity to 
maintain the processes of pro-
ductivity." 

"Industrial society has no way to 
change these social relations," he 
continued. "There is no theory 
of revolution or reasons for having 
one. a social class exists to 
change it." 

Arthur Frommer in "Europe on $5 a Day", stated that the most 
exalted citizen in France is the student. And we feel this can apply 
as well to a UCSD coed as to a Parisien. An international Studt!nt 
ID card can be purchased Cor $2 from the National Student Association, 
265 Madison Avenue, ew York, New Y0rk 10016 which will entitle 
the traveler to such benefits as low cost student housing, student 
cafeterias (where full-course dinners run as low a.> 60~), reduced 
museum and theatre fares and reduced train travel prices. (Add itional 
information regarding the trains can be obtained by writing to the 
French National Railroads, 610 Fifth Avenue, ew York). 

The cheapest way to reach Paris is by jet. Islandic offers the lowest 
rates - $289 round trip frum Paris. Student charter boats are also 
available durir,g the summer for around a minimum $300 round trip. 

Cathy Merrill and Kathy Benson will be leaving from ~ew York 
the LOth of February; The cheerleading squad is losing Cathy Merrill 
and the Bookstore is losing its two best student helpers - but they've 
promised to send back monthly articles to thp. Triton Times dp.s-
cribing their adventures in Paris. So we all won't feel too left-behind! For Muir College

conference rooms would be great for club meetings--and they would 
111 be comfortable!" 

Shepard outlined the administrative offices which might be included 
in the building. "We would ll:J.ve Senate chambers, of course, but the 
radio and newspaper facilities would also finn a place in the Union. 
The size and facilities of the Union buildmg, howf!ver, depend on the 
interest students show for the project. I hope the y start to come to 
Union meetings co help us in planning what we want." 

At the AS meeting two days ago, President Rich Altenhoff revealed 
plans for an AS- ponsored Student Directory, which would cost UCSD 
nothing to print--the company makes moneyoffofadvertising revenue--
and would be free, or at least very cheap, for students to btlY. Dean 
Murphy added that a combination of the Campus Directory and Student 
Directory could save the University some mo:\ey and could raise a 
goodly amo'Jnt of revenue for the AS.
