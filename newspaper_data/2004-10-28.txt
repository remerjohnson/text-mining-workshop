A budget submitted last week 
by Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Joseph W. Watson to the 
University Office of the 
President would cut Early 
Academic Outreach Program 
funding by approximately 80 
percent from last year, while 
allocating an additional 5200,000 
for the UCSD Preuss charter 
school, according to A.S. 
President Jenn Pae and Student 
Affirmative Action Committee 
Chair Emily Leach.

In an effort to reach millions 
of young adult voters before 
Election Day, liberal student-
based group MoveOn Student 
Action has launched a national 
advertisin, campaign in more 
than 150 university newspapers 
warning of a possible military 
draft in the event of President 
George W. Bush's re-election. 

"Right now we're running the 
'Feel a Draft' campaign to educate 
students about the potential return 
of the draft and how the course we 
set in this decrion may make the 
difference," said Ben Brandzel, 
project director of MoveOn 
Student Action, a group with a 
membership of 170,000 affiliated 
college students. "This is just one 
aspect of many potential conse-
quences of our current foreign 
policy, but it has the potential to 
permanently change our way of 
life. We should at least make that 
choice with our eyes open." 

Democrats 
to begin 

newspaper 
By AlESSANDRA RADICATI 

Contributing Writer 

Campus College Democrats 
recently began planning the start 
of a left-leaning publication called 
the NtW Frontier to give liberals 
on campus a counterpart to the 
conservative California RevitW. 

"We wanted to expand our 
influence on campus," said 
Thurgood Marshall College 
sophomore and College 
Democrats Print Director Priya 
Singh. "We wanted to have an 
option for the liberal side." 

Marshall senior and College 
Democrats president Dylan 
Snowden said that the NeTIJ 
Frrmtier is a necessary addition to 
the campus media because liberal 
students do not have enough 
resources. 

"We've seen that there [are] a 
lot of liberal students here at 
UCSD," Snowden said. "They 
don't know where to turn." 

The CoUege Democrats plan to 
include information about "intern-
shipl and availability of job options 
in the political arena," Snowden 

In a closely contested race that 
political experts believe may ulti-
mately be decided by the 18- to 30-
year-old demographic, youth advo-
cacy groups have questioned 
whether or not a vote for a certain 
candidate . implies voting for the 
conscription of college-age stu-
dents as well. 

Though both presidential candi-
dates have firmly denied plans to 
implement the draft if ~Iected, 
MoveOn Student Action members 
said they believe Democratic nomi-
nee Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) is 
more likely to stay true to his pledge 
than his incumbent opponent. 

·We believe that Kerry's poli-
cies will push us away from a draft 
- such as enlarging the active-
duty military and relying more on 
international assistance - while 
Bush's policies have and wiJI con-
tinue to push us towards a draft -
more of the same combination of 
pre-emptive war and endless occu-
pation," Brandzel said. "We

The administration is still 
waiting for the final approval of 
the budget plan from UCOP and 
cannot comment on the details, 
Watson said. 

When the state Legislature 
decided to restore money for 
outreach this year, the deal 
included an implicit agreement 
to aJIocate a certain amount of 
money to EAOP, according to 
Leach. 

The cut for EAOP was expect-
ed to be roughly 50 percent of its 
budget last year - or a final bud-
get of about 5700,000 - for each 
UC campus, Leach said.

Joseph Ghougassian, an adviser to 
the Coalition Provisional

spoke on his efforts to restore and 
modernize Iraq's higher educa-

Oct. 25. 

Ghoupssian bepn his talk 
with descriptions of Iraq's higher 

education system during the rule 
of Saddam Hussein. According to 
Ghougassian, Iraq has 17 univer-
sities and numerous other techni-
cal schools that are comparable to 
American community colleges. 

Hussein established 11 of 
these universities during the 
19905, mainly for political rea-
sons, without ensuring that the 
necessary learning resources were 
available at each campus,

funding by $200,000 and cut support for the Early k.ademic Outreach Program. 
posed to aJIocate only 5250,000 to 
the campus program, according to 
EAOP Director Rafael 
Hernandez. This figure would 
represent less than 20 percent of 
last year's budget. 

"UCSD has a goal of diversity 
- every organization should," 
Leach said. "These cuts not only 
affect outreach programs, but 
they also affect the racial demog-
raphy of the UCSD campus." 

According to Leach, three 

years ago, 10 out of 33 black stu-
dents accepted to UCSD had par-
ticipated in EAOP. Black students 
comprise roughly 1 percent of the 
campus . population. UCSD 
EAOP has also been one of the 
most successful of all UC out-
reach programs, constituting 
nearly 20 percent of a1l UC-wide 
outreach under the program, 
Leach said.

Treasurer calls for $5 
billion endowment 

By AMY IFURUNG 
Contributing Writer 

State Treasurer Phil Angelides 
has announced a proposal for an 
estimated 55 billion endowment 
to help pay the costs of higher 
education. Dubbed the 
"California Hope Endowment," 
the money would provide funding 
for the University of California, 
California State University and 
community colleges. 

"It is going to be a powerful 
challenge to open the door of col-
lege wider to more students, but 
it must be done if California is to 
have a chance of succeeding in 
the 21st-century global econo-
my," Angelides said at an Oct. 19 
press conference in Sacramento, 

Calif., where he first announced 
the plan. 

If passed by the California 
Legislature, the proposal would 
direct the state to sell underused 
public land to private holders. It 
also calls for the development of 
such lands for affordable housing. 

Money drawn from the sur-
plus lands would then be used to 
fund scholarships and academic 
outreach progra.ms at both the 
college and high school level. 

The treasurer also used the 
press conference to criticize the 
2004-05 state budget and its 
treatment of higher education, 
citing grievances that included 
the state's failure to increase

Sallie Mae denies 

investigation reports 
Sallie Mae, the nation's leader in education 

debt servicing. which manages more than $98 
billion in student loans, has denied media 
reports that it is under investigation by the 
Califomia Attomey General's office. 

Earlier in October, the Financial Times 
reported that investigators were looking at 
loans the company made to schools that did 
not have accreditation and determining 
whether the lender misled students about its 
private loan programs. 

In a statemen~ the company admitted that 
it was "responding to questions and informa-
tion requests' from the state's top law enforcer, 
though it said no formal investigation was in 
progress. 

Aknowledging that it had provided $350 
million in loans to students enrolled in "career 
training schools" in the state, the press release 
denied the reported allegations and stated that 
the company had "no marketing or other incen-
tive arrangements with these closed schools' 
and had "adequately reserved for potential 
losses in its career training portfolio.' 

Officially known as tne SML Corporation, 
the company was established in 1973 as a gov-
emment-sponsored enterprise and in 1997 
began a process to become private. It recently 
announced that it is under investigation by fed-
eral securities officials for past statements of 
eamings. 

John Muir College to drop

As part of the college's annual Halloween 
celebrations, John Muir College students will 
drop a 42D-pound pumpkin off the top floor of

Named GPA, the pumpkin represents the

wnlch began 29 years ago. 

Filled with an assortment of candy, the pump-
kin will land on a plastic sheet marked off in a 
bingo grid, which students will use beforehand to

A group of higher~ducation lobby groups,

on tax deductions for patent and intellectual

Designed to curb fraud and abuses in

Report notes major changes 
in college choice I A.S. COUNCIL AT A GLANCE 

Though universities have streamlined their 
application processes in the past 50 years and 
have developed more 'sophisticated adminis-
trative practices, more parents and high school 
students feel ' tremendous pressure' to make 
the right college choices, according to a new 
report by the Lumina Foundation for Education. 

The document analyzes changes in higher .. 
education public policy and institutional recruit-
ment practices over the past half century. 

Access to post-secondary education has 
improved dramatically - especially for women, 

low~ncome students and racial minorities -
the foundation reported, though recent increas-
es in tuition at public and private institutions 
hawe forced families to search out the 'best 
deal' for a college education. 

The foundation's report warned that 
increased competition among colleges and uni-
versities has weakened the ability of national 
organizations like the College Board "to broker 
cooperative policies and practices that could 
help students and institutions~ 

Meeting .10 - Oct 27,2004 

Public Input 
Student Affirmative Action Committee 

representative Jacob Davis told the council 
about a recent incident of vandalism in the 
Earl Warren College residence halls. Davis 
said there was a report of several college-
aged males streaking through · Warren 
College and writing a racial epitaph on the 
door of a student. The council urged any 
person with information about incidents of 
this narure to contact the UCSD Police 
Department. 

Items of Immediate 
Consideration 
Items K and L 

Councilmembers voted to appoint A.S. 
President Jenn Pae and Thurgood Marshall 
College sophomore Senator Jason Hoskins 
to the Co-op Oversight Committee. 

Reports 
President Jenn Pae 

Pae reported that Vice Chancellor 
Joseph W. Watson was receptive to her · 
request to add additional student represen-
tation ~o the committee governing UCSD 
c1osed-ci rcuit television stations. According 
to Pae, Watson agreed to request additional 
student representatives from each of the col-
leges at UCSD . 

Vice President of Academic Affairs 
Caroline Song 

Song reported that UCSD is currently 
over-enrolled by approximately three per-
cent. According to Song, the campus cur-
rently has 23,675 undergraduate and gradu-
ate students, eJlcluding pharmacy and sum-
mer Teacher Education Program students. 
The state currently provides funds for an 
enrollment of 23,050 students. With 80 stu-
dents expected to enter the campus this win-
ter under the Guaranteed Transfer Option, 
UCSD will not be receiving state funding 
for 3.3 percent of its students. Song said, 

however, that this does not always present a 
problem, as additional state funding is allo-
cated when possible. 

President Pro-tempore Ted McCombs 
McCombs reported that the voter guides 

for the Nov. 2 elections have arrived . 
Students living on campus will receive the 
guides in their campus mailboxes while A.S . 
Council members will pass out guides to stu-
dents living dff campUl; in th'e neil rew tf.1ys . 

Old Business 
Items F andJ 

The council passed legislation which 
changed the voting system for A.S. elections 
back to a plurality system. For the past two 
years, the A.S. Council had been in the 
process of instituting an instant runoff vot-
ing system for campus elections. The cur-
rent council, however, denied legislation to 
fund the development of instant runoff and 
has now amended the A.S. election bylaws to 
reinstitute rules that require candidates to 
receive the most votes in a race to be 
declared the winner. The legulation passed 
by a vote of 15-4-0. 

ItemG 
The council passed legislation amending 

the election bylaws to allow students to wear 
clothing or accessories endQrsing a certain 
candidate in classrooms. Debate arose in the 
spring 2004 elections when complaints were 
filed saying that students were "actively 
campaigning" in classrooms when they wore 
candidate-specific clothing to class. 

Announcements 
Women's Commissioner Representative 

Katie Drago announced that the Women's 
Commission will be hosting a discussion on 
Oct. 28 entitled "How Healthy is Your 
Rela tionshi p?" It will take place at 6 pm in 
the Santa Barbara! Los Angeles room in 
Price Center. 

Members of the A.S. Council urged all 
registered voters to vote on Nov. 2.

Draft: RNC calls campaign 
an election ... year scare tactic 

ClINinwd from I 
launched the dra~ campaign 
because we saw it as a very impor-
tant issue to our members that was 
not getting a lot of attention from 
the mainstream media and the 
candidates .• 

Republican National Conuninee 
spokesman 'Yier Shi said that 
MoveOn's claim is false, and that the 
group is spreading fear to help 
Democrats win votes. 

"President Bush has said 
numerous times, emphatically, that 
there will be no draft if he is elect-
ed," Shi said. "Right now we have 
enough soldiers in Iraq. An ail-vol-
unteer army is best suited to fight 
the wars of the 21st century. It 
works when we pay well and have a 
large military budget ... 

Representatives of the 
Democratic National Committee 
differed in their opinion of America' 
s current military situation. 

"George W. Bush has badly 
mismanaged and overextended the 
military. It can't sustain its current 
pace," Democratic National 
Committee spokesman Josh 
Earnest said. 

Earnest also praised Kerry's 
policies on the issue. 

"John Kerry has a plan to 
increase the number of military 
troops and add incentives to 
encourage military service, increas-
ing volunteer personnel. Bush has 
not presented a plan to deal with 
new threa ts and the straiJI being 
put on our military," he said. 

No . evidence supports . 
Democratic assertions that the mil-
itary faces a shortage of soldierS, 
Shi said, suggesting that the use of 
the issue by the Kerry campaign 
indicates its willingness "to do and 
say anything to win political 

points." 
"I would tell [young voters) to 

DOt worry about the draft," Shi 
Slid. "I want them to be active, to 
vote. Hopefully their votes would 
be based on education and pocket-
book issues, and whether or not 
they are being protected. To vote 
on false information would be 
unfortunate .• 

According to Selective Service 
spokesman DicJr. F1ahavan, the 
president and Congress would 
need to approve a request from the 
Department of Defense and amend 
the current national law that deals 
with conscription before being able 
to reinstate a draft. 

On Oct. 5, only two members of 
the U.S. House of Representatives 
voted in favor of a symbolic bill 
that would have reinstated military 
conscription. 

"Congress has no immediate 
interest in bringing back the draft, 
(and) the Department of Defense 
has indicated no need for a draft," 
F1abavan said. "It is happy with our 
volunteer services. [The Selective 
Service) has not received any spe-
cial guidance to get ready (for an 
impending draft]. We have simply 
heard what everyone else has 
heard." 

Created to engage students 
and young people in the political 
process, MoveOn Student Action 
is a project of the MoveOn.org 
Voter Fund and Click Back 
America . - progressive groups 
that have been critical of Bush. 
The project has no affili~tion with 
any presidential campaign and its 
funding comes from individual 
contributions.

Paper: Publication to seek A.S. funds, ads

in the political arena," Snowden 
said. 

The publication, to be printed 
three times a quarter, will also 
focus on issues pertaining to 
UCSD students, according to 
Snowden. 

"[We will) delve into issues that 
deal with every single college," 
Snowden said. 

College Democrats have said 
that the newspaper will discuss 
domestic issues that are not 
given much coverage, such as the 
environment and women's 
rights. 

The Nt'UJ Frrmtier will not be 
the only liberal publication on 
campus, however. The Nt'W 
indiCiltur, while not affiliated with 
a particular club or political party, 
is another progressive publication 
available to students. 

"I wish (the College 
Democrats) the best of luck," said 
John Muir College senior and 
Nt'W indiClllur writer Steve York. "I 
personally see [the Nt'W Frrmtier) 
as a direct response and mirror of 
the Rtvit'W." 

York said that he expects that 
there will be differences between 
the Nt'W Frontier and the Nt'W 
bu/i,.rur, which will reOect the 
"many distinct brands of liberal-
ism" that exist on the political 
spectrum. He said that he expects 
the Nt'W Frontier to be more 
"mainstream" than the Nt'W 
buIiutor. 

"I don't see how the Nt'W 
Frontier will vary (from the 
GrumliIl1l) on local issues," York 
said. . 

Chris Fennel, a Marshall col-
lege sophomore and editor in 
chief of the C.liforni. Rtvit'W, crit-
icized the plans for the new paper 
because of its affiliation with a 

particular party. 
"I don't think we should have 

any political organizations, per se, 
putting out papers," Fennel said. 
"When they put out an ideological 
publication it becomes pure pro-
paganda." 

The Clllifornill Rtvit'UJ is not 
affiliat.-.d with any political organi-
zation at UCSD. 

" I don't think we should 
have any political 

organizations, per se, 
putting out papers. " 

- 0Iris Fennel. editor in chief, 
CtMomiG ReWew 

The Nt'W Frrmrier will be fund-
ed by Associated Students and, 
most likely, through advertising, 
according to Snowden. 

The A.S. Council uses a con-
tent-blind policy for funding stu-
dent media. 

"We try to be as content-neu-
tral as possi ble, " said A.S. 
Corrunissioner of Communications 
Hilary Elder. 

Elder said she acknowledged 
that this policy can be controver-
sial, but said that it is important 
for maintaining First Amendment 
rights for students. 

"I can understand how some 

publications definitely offend 
people," Elder said. "My person-
al opinion is that everyone has a 
right to their opinion. 
Freedom of speech must be 
defended." 

Fennel said that he agrees with 
the policy. 

"If it were not content-blind, 
that would be a form of censor-
ship," Fennel said. 

News publications on campus 
go through the same process to 
receive funding as other student 
organizations, but also have to 
meet with Elder, who then makes 
recommendations as to how much 
funding each publication should 
receive. . 

Numerous factors go into 
determining how much money to 
give to a publication, according 
to Elder. The factors can include 
the publication's length and 
whether it will be printed in 
color. 

Seniority is also a considera-
tion when it comes to receivin tr 
funds, she said, because the A.S. 
Council is more familiar with 
older publications. 

"New organizations tend to 
not get as much money as the 
ones that already exist," Elder 
said. 

The GUllrdian does not receive 
funding from Associated Students 
and is funded exclusive Iy by adver-
tisement.

~xperts on Demand will 
benefit UCSD greatly 

I n any research institu-tion, especially one as highly regarded as 
UCSD, the quality of the 
faculty dictates the merit of 
the school. With that in 
mind, the new Experts on 
Demand service, which 
enables faculty experts to 
be interviewed on five tele-
vision, will not only give 
faculty members the ability 
to share their knowledge 
with the masses, but will 
increase the international 
renown of UCSD as well. 

Many faculty members 
conduct important, rele-
vant research that remains 
largely inaccessible to the 
general public. As a public 
university, UCSD should 
grant the populace an 
understanding of what their 
tax dollars are funding, and 
this service gives the uni-
versity the means to do so. 

Although this service 
costs approximately 

$15,000 per year, this sum 
is minimal, considering 
that the university was 
able to save money by cre-
ating the studio out of an 
already existins infrastruc-
ture and fundmg the ser-
vice thou~h "internal real-
locations rather than stu-
dents' pocketbooks. With 
rising registration fees and 
eXJ;>ensive textbooks, the 
university should be com-
mended for finding the 
resources to create such a 
valuable program without 
having students foot the 
bill. 

Ultimately, the service 
will only bnng prestige to 
the university, which is 
advantageous for faculty 
members and students

ficult for the pro~am to be

invaluable to society; no 
cost should be too great. 

Good ' news about birth 
control is premature 

F or the first time since women started taking 
oral contraceptives in 

1960, reports came out last 
week suggesting that this 
form of oirth control might 
be something other than a 
cause for health concern. 
What wasn't a first, .howev-
er, was the premature 
media coverage of the stir-
ring reports. 

While' the results from 
the study - which was 
conducted by the Women's 
Health Initiative and 
included data from over 
162,000 women - are rea-
son for potential reassur-
ance, a celebration at this at 
this point would be irre-
sponsible, as the group has 
not yet released its data. 

But unfortunately, news 
oudets from the Los Angeles 
Times to New England 
70urnal of Medicine nave 
been prematurely ensuring 
the public that "millions of 
women can sleep better 
now." With the health of the 
16 million daily users of the 
Rill hanging in the balance, 
there is no room for sensa-
tionalized media to preempt 
the need for complete and 
accurate information. 

The results, which were 
announced at a conference, 
have not even been pub-
lished in a peer-reviewed 
professional Journal. Even 
experts agree that study 
conclusions will need to be 
published and scrutinized 
m more detail before the 
medical community can 
respond, not to mention 
the fact that the study must 
be confirmed tnrough 
replication to be effica- . 
dous. The problem is that 
the media have already 
responded, having created 
an all too common ~he­
nomen on best called sci-
ence by press release." 

Altliough it would be 
easy to assume that the first 
stuay done with ~ositive 
feedback about birth con-
trol is the final word on the 
subject, we should know, if 
not be treated and 
informed, better than that. 
Similar to drugs and prod-
ucts that are put on the 
mark.et before enough test-
ing on them has been done, 
so too are these stories that 
slip through the cracks of 
the so-called standards to 
which our media hoTds 
them.

in the event's nine-year history. 

Since studel'lt scholarship SlIP-

THE UCSD GUAIlDIAN OPINION 5 

u.s. politics: Absurdity in adion 
indecent 
exposure 
Marianne Madden 

W hoa! Apparendy there~ some son of election cominJ up. Who knew? I 
suess I haven't . watched Tv, lis-
tened to the radio, passed by 
Library Walk or eYeIl stepped out-
side for the past six months. OK, 
make that I year. I don't get out 
much, okay? 

I jest, of course. In fact, I am a 
btl political nerd. I read political :& sites, newspapers, articles and 
books like they're the newest issue 
of Cosmopolitan, and eat up the 
presidential debates like they were 
chocolate. I even worked fur a 
political party this summer (I'm 
&om the Bay area and have less 
than five American flags on my car; 
I bet you em guess which one). I 
loved me job because it afforded a 
valuable opportunity to hold ooto 
the naive belief that I can malce a 
difference in the world. Also, it let 
Republicans threaten me with 
death while I was alone and 
unanned, and apparendy they get a 
real kick out of that (or at least I 
think they do, judging from their 
copiow; drooling and huge grins as 
they pointed their shotguns at me). 

One night, as my liberal scum 
co-workers and I scarfed down 
Thai food after a full day's work, 
two men . worlting for the 
Republicans overheard our con-
versation and introduced them-
selves as "The Enemy." 

Needless to say, much finger-
snapping and choreographed 
dance fighting ensued. 

~',,- , 

Also needless to say, we 'routed 
them. Our sheer nwnbers over-
rode our status as spineless flower-
sniffing hippies. Also, inbred 
Republican hacks are terrible fight-
ers. 

Of course, in reality, tht most 
mtl'll# bout of vm.J !pIIPTing tWr' 
occurred. We won handily. As I 
said, inbred Republican hacks are 
tenible fighters. 

I recount this incident to illus-
trate that America is, indeed, bit-
terly divided between the two 
parties - and that I, even as a lib-
eral who professes to value toler-
ance and open-mindedness, am 
totally, hypocritically, intolerant 
of'Republican beliefs. Just look at 
my obvious hatred toward those 
who don't agree with me! Why, I 
should be cast out of our great 
country, or something. 

But I'd also like to illustrate an 
even more sinister trait of the 
country's current political dis-
course. A typical conversation 
about the candidates' stances on 
important issues goes something 
like this: 

KERRY FAN: You know, I real-
ly don't agree with most things 
Bush has done during his teno, and 
Kerry's stances reaDy seem to 
match mine a lot better. He's pro-
choice, doesn't think religion 
should factor into political deci-
sions, supports stem cell research, 
has a more realistic plan for Iraq 
and wants to give tax cuts to the 
middle class, instead of just to me 
rich. He totally has my vote. 

KERRY SKEPTIC: But ... 
Terrorism! Osama! Saddam! 
Weapons of mass destruction! 

(FORMER) KERRY FAN: Oh, 
man, thanks for reminding me. I'm 
totally gonna vote for Bush! He's 
got the bravery it takes to stand up 
to mose terrorist killers. Fuck 

Kerry, that commie bastard! We've 
got to kic;k some ass! 

See? Turning a Kerry fan into 
a FORMER Kerry fan is as easy 
as pulling out mat Republican 
trump card, terrorism. Sadly, I'm 
not kidding, or even exaggerating. 
I've talked to dozens of Bush fans, 
and all but one of them cited ter-
rorism as the main - and, more 
often than not, sole - reason 
they were voting for Bush. Recent 
academic research has borne out 
this fact. The majority of 
Americans view Democrats as 
more adept handlers of all domes-
tic affairs, and those who will vote 
Republican in this election are 
motivated by f~ar alone. The 
obvious fear mongering of 
Republican advertisements is a 
tactical move, and one that 
ignores all the other issues in this 
election in favor of magnifying a 
single, divisive issue. Awtsomt. 

There you have it: My attempt 
at illustrating the reasons why 
young Americans are cynical, apa-
thetic and not exactly tripping over 
themselves to vote in every elec-
tion. It's because the state of 
American politics isn't as mind-
numbingly simplistic and manipu-
lative as it seems at first glance -
it's much, much worse. 

I figure that the American 
political system is our genera-
tion's to inherit, so I, along with 
all the rest of us, should register 
my opinion on which ridiculous 
direction it goes next. If you're 
not sure who to vote for, just 
decide which candidate sucks the 
least, then vote for the other guy 
because Fox News told you so. It 
works every time.

EAOP: Staff to fall from 26 to four under plan Iraq: Former CPA adviser 
criticizes Hussein regime continued from page I 

The campus' EAOP staff 
would fall from 26 members to 
four after the cuts, which would 
limit the numbers of middle- and 
high-school students the program 
would be able to help, according 
to Hernandez. 

"We definitely see the differ-
ence, and I think the community 
will see the difference as well," 
Hernandez said. "Our focus is on 
academic development programs, 
and now we can serve fewer stu-
dents." 

At the same time, student 
leaders have said that the budget 
for Preuss School will increase by 
S200,OOO this year, though 
Watson would not confirm the 
number. The school serves 
underrepresented sixth- through 
12 th-grade students from low 
socioeconomic backgrounds in 

the area. Students from the 
school's 2004 graduating class 
now attend universities such as 
Stanford, Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology, University of San 
Diego and UCSD. 

"The Preuss School is wonder-
ful, but it should not be promoted 
at the expense of UCSD EAOP," 
Leach said. "It is a shame that this 
scramble for the pot of outreach 
money has unfolded on our cam-
pus as a battle between EAOP and 
Preuss." 

UCSD is the only UC campus 
with a charter school on its prop-
erty. 

"It's disconcerting that there's 
no provision to account for that 
uniqueness," Hernandez said. 

Watson aclmowledges that the 
recent university budget cuts have 
created challenges for the alloca-
tion of outreach funding. 

"Given the amount of money 
available, the question is how to 
allocate it to a number of good and 
worthy programs," Watson said. 
"We face real challenges on cam-
pus. I don't thinlc anyone is satis-
fied with the number of underrep-
resented students on campus. I 
thinlc all the outreach programs 
have contributed and tried to 
bring the numbers up, but a lot 
more needs to be done." 

Pae said that student leaders 
would be working with the admin-
istration for a feasible solution to 
the issue. 

"This outreach funding was 
fought for by students on behalf of 
students," Pae said. "The objective 
should be to impact as many stu-
dents as possible."

cominued from page I 
Ghougassian said. During his 15 
months in Iraq, he observed that 
universities significantly lacked 
proper libraries, Internet services 
and laboratories for student use. 

"Why would [Hussein) create 
all these universities at a time when 
Iraq was fInancially strapped?" 
Ghougassian said. "For the shrewd 
politician, he did not want to see 
the Iraqi youth in the streets, and 
given the economic conditions of 
Iraq he did not want to see the 
youth doing nothing." 

There was also little room for 
academic freedom in Iraq, as stu-
dents were mainly trained to mem-
orize facts, and Iraqi professors 
were forbidden to go abroad for 
academic purposes, Ghougassian 
said. These restrictions on Iraqi 
higher education greatly hindered 
academic progress. 

versities have not been receptive to 
the Iraqi students' and universities' 
needs," Ghougassian said. 
"American universities are nor very 
much into charities." 

Before it disbanded on June 28, 
the CPA appointed a new minister 
of higher education for Iraq. 
Ghougassian emphasized the PCI -
sonal pleasure he received frol11 
using education reform to influ-
ence politic~. 

"It was such a gratifying 
moment to really feel the satisfac-
tion [and) self-fulfillment by find-
ing yourself in a situation where 
you really become an instrument 
for peace and higher education," he 
said. 

Plan: State land sales would pay for proposal "Iraqi professors were prohibit-ed from traveling abroad to partic-
ipate in seminars or to perform 
research," Ghougassian said. 
"There was no opportunity for 
them to go abroad [or) to know 
what was going on in their own 
field ." 

Humanitarian assistance expert 
Dr. Eric Greirens, who served as 
the event's moderator, reflected 
upon the importance of rebuilding 
educational institutions after the 
war in Iraq. 

"I think we have to understand 
that, as an outside force, we're 
dealing not with victims, but with 
survivors of a war," Greitens said. 
"The extent to which our pro-
grams are successful is when 
there's a productive synergy 
between what we're offering and 
what the people desire, and the 
extent to which there's trouble 
when there are two visions corning 
into conflict."

financial aid and "hiking up col-
lege fees up and down the line." 

"For the first time ever, this 
state is developing policies that 
will result in fewer kids going to 
school," Angelides said. 

Land that quali fies for sale 
under the proposal is described by 
Angelides as "urban land clearly 
suitable for development." 
Eligible property does not include 
rural or environmentally protect-
ed lands. 

Angelides cited a Department 
of Motor Vehicles parking lot in 
San Francisco that, if sold, could 
yield as much as S25 million. 

"Well-located, urban state-
owned properties like the DMV 
site in San Francisco have been 
eyed by developers like myself for 
a very long time - drooling 
might be another word [for it)," 
said Carol Galante, president and 
CEO of BRIDGE Housing 
Corporation, a non-profit orgarii-

zation that develops affordable 
housing. 

Galante was one of five speak-
ers at the press conference who 
voiced their ap'proval for the 
California Hope Endowment. 
Other spealcers included UC 
Berkeley professor of real estate 
development Robert Edelstein, 
Cal State Sacramento education 
professor Ken Futernick, UC 
Davis freshman Jenny Gama and 
former state Secretary of 
Education Gary Hart. 

Speakers described Angelides' 
plan as "imaginative" and "innov-
ative." 

"F undamentally, the rational-
izing and Iiqudying of an under-
utilized asset land makes just a lot 
of sense," Edelstein said. "Not all 
land, but the appropriate land." 

The University of California 
expressed approval for this type of 
funding scheme but has stopped 
short of endorsing Angelides' pro-
posal.

"The university supports the 
goals of increasing student finan-
cial assistance and expanding state 
funding for higher education, but 
we have not had an opportunity to 
examine the treasurer's recent 
proposal in detail," UC 
spokesman Paul Schwartz stated 
in an e-mail. 

If it comes to full fruition, the 
endowment could become the 
seventh-largest higher education 
endowment in the country- with 
a projected annual return of S300 
million, according to Angelides. 

"The endowments annual rev-
enue can fund full scholarships for 
385,000 community college stu-
dents, or give a scholarship for 
fees and all other cOSts to 19,000 
CSU students" if entirely used for 
student financial aid, Angelides' 
spokesman Mitchel Benson stated 
in a press release.

After joining the CPA in May, 
Ghougassian worked with the Iraqi 
Education Ministry to introduce 
several reforms into the country's 
education system in the aftermath 
of U.S. military action in the coun-
try. University faculties began 
electing new presidents and deans 
for their campuses in a free and fair 
process, and exams were reinstated 
so that students could graduate, he 
said. 

Ghougassian also worked to 
introduce the first nationwide 
round of Fulbright Scholarships in 
Iraq, allowing 25 Iraqi students to 
participate in foreign exchange 
programs. However, he said that he 
experienced trouble in securing 
exchange agreements with 
American universities.

classic 1950's horror film "Creature From the 
Black Lagoon," Nathanson and his longstanding 
ensemble further dismantJe the barrier between 
pop culture and high culture, adding both jokes and 
improvised jazz runs to a brand new soundtrack. It's 
all part of an effort on the Passengers' part to rid 
jazz of its snooty reputation and make it fresh - an 
effort that has taken a fun and relevant tum with 
the band's latest project. 

Roy and the Passengers first experimented with 
Jack Arnold's classic B-film in 1997, when they 
replaced 20 minutes of the soundtrack and dialogue 
with their own mix of experimental musical theater

and performed it live at Town Hall in New York City. 
Commissioned to revisit the project in 2CXl3 by the 
Celebrate Brooklyn Festival, the Jazz Passangers 
remade the entire soundtrack, including music, dia-
logue and sound effects, combining their trademark 
offbeat humor. penchant for musical theater and vir" 
tuosic musical talenta into a 3-Q.gIesses-requi'ed, 
avant-garde comedy. . 

It's part of 8 lifelong passion for Nathanson, who 
says he's at.wys baen tom between the mediums of 
theater. where he "was raised,' and music. 

"I was a theater major at Columbia in the early 
70s. EvenbJally I decided it was more important to do 
music, but then later I ended up doing , avant;garde 
theater in the East Village," he said. 

The Jazz Passengers have always been aboU; 
pushing the music as far as it could go in a multillJcle 
of directions. Iv! early reputation for pop-music 8lCp8r'-
imentation - Nathanson is sometimes compared to

EMS Costello and formerBlondie member Deborah 
Harry, who fronted the group on their most highly 
acclaimed S11Jdio release, 1996's Individuslly Twistsd. 

Humor, too, has been cantral to the group's vision, 
and, according to Nathanson, part of jazz from the 
beginning.

After the immense critical acclaim of Turn on the Bright Lights, Interpol 
have returned with a new 
record that does not try too 
hard to live up to the often 
dreaded "sophomore album" 
expectations. 

Antics glides seamlessly 

Simply put, the problem with heavy music these days is that no one has 
found anything new to do 
with it. 

Look at Helmet's latest 
release, the relentless Size 
Matters, if you disagree. 
Helmet started out as inno-
vators back in the early '90s, 
when vocalist/guitarist Page 
Hamilton stocked the heavy 
rock bag wi th a few new 
tricks, adding weird time sig-

dance!

With the ClU'rent affec-

Not U turn to synths and

create highly catchy dance

Now, seven years after

songs like "Wonderful

With newly apparent

The arty alienation of 

Hamilton's early vocal style 
has aged into a resigned and 
bitter growl; the whole 
album seems stuck in one 
medium-tempo, 01ll'0ff rut. 
All of the songs are laugh-
ably similar in their arrange-
ment, and the main draw of 
the band's ' sound 
Hamilton's massive, slow 
guitar rumble - loses its 
freshness about a minute 
and a half into its best exam-
ple, the opener "Smarr." 
Helmet may have marked 
the heavy-rock genre a

a good job of proving that 
they no longer do.

Gory doesn't make for scary in 'Saw' 
Poor acting, convenient plot mar ambitious debut 

JAKE HARE 
Contributing Writer 

The debut feature for writer/director James Wan, "Saw" tries desperately to put 
life back into the dead horror genre 
with loads of perverse visuals and 
an excellent concept, but fails to be 
more than promising. The makers 
of "Saw" apparently noticed that 
there hasn't been a good psycho-
logical thriller since 1995's 
"Seven"; with its darle, grainy 
loole, claustrophobic camera 
angles and use of a serial lciller 
with a message to tell the world, 
"Saw" seems influenced by the 
earlier film. _ 

With a very intriguing concept 
for a seriallciller flick, "Saw" has a 
lot of potential. Unfortunately, 
poor scripting, weird editing and 
horrendous acting ruin any emo-
tion the movie creates, and occa-
sionallyeven turns it into an unin-
tentional comedy. 

"Saw" opens with two men, 
Adam (Leigh WhanneU, who also 
wrote the script) and Dr. Lawrence 
Gordon (Cary Elwes). awaking in a 
dark and dingy bathroom, chained 
at the ankles, with a dead body 
lying between them, They have no 
recollection of how they ended up 
there, but soon discover that they 
have tapes in their pockets. Using a 
tape player siruated in the dead 
body's hand, they discover they are 
the pawns in a sick game invented 
by the sinister "Jigsaw," who tor-
tures his victims into killing them-
selves, 

The rest of the movie unfolds 
in a combination of expository 

Saw 

** Starring Leigh Whannell, Cary Elwes and Danny Glover 
In theaters Oct 29 

Rated R 

flashbacks and scenes where the 
two main characters sit around 
and talk through the situation. 
The flashbacks are both absurd 
and annoying, breaking the ten-
sion the film frantically tries to 
create, while the moments with 
the two main characters drag on 
forever. 

The audience is also intro-
duced to tons of other characters. 
many of whom are not important, 
but all of whom fall victim to 
mediocre acting. It's hard to 
determine if the fault lies more in 
the script or the actual acting 
itself. Either way, it drags this 
movie down, dampening some of 
the more tense moments, espe-
cially during the ending, which 
should have been chilling, but 
sadly comes across as unnecessary 
melodrama, Elwes, who is best 
known as Wesley in "The Princess 
Bride," is especially bad, showing 
why he hasn't attempted many 
dramatic performances ill recent 
years. Adding to the list of prob-
lems is a plot full of holes and 
conveniences. For a movie about 

Film 
REVIEW 

puzzles, this film sure cheats a lot. 
"Saw" arrives with plenty of 

gore just in time for Halloween. 
Sadly, violence is all this movie 
will give you, and you'll likely get 
more frights from a haunted 
house or any of the "Scream" 
movies. It's really a shame though, 
as the filmmaleers seemed to des-
perately want this to rise above 
the level of the lame slasher fliclcs 
that have plagued the horror 
genre of late. 

The creative premise and sev-
eral original aud disturbing scenes 
of torture save this movie at times, 
and show that the filmmakers 
began on the right track. In the 
end, however, all "Saw" adds up to 
is perhaps five good minutes of 
material, spread out over a 100-
minute film that only gets worse 
as it nears its disappointing end-
ing.

Tritons: Late .. game scoring frenzy proves costly 
continued from page ,6 

sophomore midfielder Megan 
Dickey in the 57th minute to give 
UCSD a 2-1 lead. However, the 
lead lasted less than a minute when 
Rodriguez took a pass from 
Broncos senior forward Lisa Araujo 
and found the back of the net with 
a quick shot from the middle, 
bringing the Broncos back in the 
game at 2-2. In the 76th minute, 
Ragudo. chipped the ball over 
Lautenschleger from shon range, 
giving Cal Poly Pomona the advan-
tage. 

Five minutes later, the Tritons 
answeroo back when freshman 
midfielder Rachel Lindenfeld 
scored an unassisted goal from five 
yards out to knot things up at 3-3 
with 10 minutes remaining. The 
Broncos took the lead once again 
when Rodriguez scored with a shot 

that deflected in off the right goal 
post in the 82nd minute. 

UCSD kept tearing away at Cal 
Poly Pomona, hoping to score in the 
last few minutes, and generated a 
couple of close calls, including a cor-
ner kick with less than a minute left 
in the match. Sophomore forward 
Kelly Cochran sent the ball from 
the comer in a last-ditch effort, but 
it was cleared out of the zone. The 
game belonged to the Broncos, who 
held on for the victory. 

"After what happened on [Oct. 
23) at Dominguez, they could eas-
ily have laid there and died," 
McManus said of his team. "But 
they came out tonight and that 
was probably one of their best 
performances all year, and I am 
well pleased with how they came 
out, the attitude they came out 
with. I think they'll come out with 

'an even better attitude [on Oct. 
27) and that's what I'm looking 
for." 

The next match for the Tritons 
was scheduled against another 
CCAA South Division opponent, 
Cal State San Bernardino, at 
RIMAC Field on Oct. 27 at 7 p.m. 
Coming into the match, the 
Coyotes were 8·7-2 overall and 6-4-
2 in conference play. Last time these 
two teams mer, UCSD won, 2-1, on 
Oct. 6 in San Bernardino, Calif. The 
match was postponed due to a field 
closure on accounr of rain, and has 
not yet been rescheduled. 

The Triton women's soccer 
team will play its final scheduled 
match of the regular season at 
home when it hosts Cal State 
Bakersfield (2-11-5, 1-7-4 CCAA) 
at RIMAC Field on Oct. 30. Play 
begins at 7 p.m.

"Our morale took a hit because 
that was a game we definitely

man/midfielder Nick Marquand 
said. 

Despite the loss, Marquand 
feels confident that the Tritons can 
learn from their mistakes and make 
the playoffs. 

"With the ,playoffs coming and 
the expectation that we will make it 
again this year, this loss will teach 
us what we need to do to be suc-
cessful when we get there," he said. 
"In the long run this is a game that 
we will talce many lessons from. " 

The Tritons' next two games

Tritons lost to earlier in the year, 
and the Cal State Bakersfi eld 
Roadrunners. Bakersfield is cur-

rendy second in the South Division 
of the CCAA and has already 
clinched a spot in the CCAA 
Championship tournament. The 
Cal State Los Angeles Golden 
Eagles are one point behind the 
Tritons in the South Division 
standings and will play first-place 
Cal State Dominguez Hills and Cal 
State San Bernardino in their next 
two games. 

According to Marquand, the 
Golden Eagles have a more experi-
enced team with older players, bur 
the Tritons are nor worried about 
that. 

"At this point we control our 
own destiny, and that's all we need 
to know going into our next few 
games," he said.

Men's water polo falls to No. 2 Stanford 
J erkovic's hat trick, Finegold's ejections-drawn record cannot hold off Cardinal 

By MAnHEW GRANT 
Sports Editor 

A Triton fan might have to look 
past the score to appreciate the 
Oct. 24 men's water polo game 
between No.2 Stanford and No.8 
UCSD at Canyonview Pool, which 
resulted in the ninth 10 s of the sea-
son for the Tritons after a 15-7 bat-
cleo Despite the margin of differ-
ence in the final score, UCSD 
seemed to gain momentum as the 
match progressed. Junior Chris 
Finegold set a new school record 
for most ejections drawn in a game, 
while the rest of the Tritons 
stepped up defensively to cut the 
number of third quarter goals 
scored-against to three, and then to 
win the fourth quarter, 5-3 . 

This meeting marked the third 
time this season that the Cardinal 
have outplayed UCSD. In the first 
match, which took place Sept. 18 at 
the USC '(ournament, the Tritons 
were downed, 15-6. Earlier this 
month, at the Oct. 2 NorCal 
Tournament hosted by University 
of Pacific, Stanford slipped away 
with its closest win over UCSD of 
the season, 14-8. 

Sophomore utility Jesse 
Casellini scored the first UCSD 

goal of the game with 2:31 remain-
ing in the first quarter, making the 
score 2-1 in Stanford's favor and 
offering the Tritons a chance to 
knot the game at two goals per side. 
However, Stanford senior driver 
Tony Azevedo had only scored 
once by then. 

Azevedo has been the leading 
scorer in each of the 2004 season 
matchups, notching five against the 
Tritons on Sept. 18, three more in 
the Oct. 2 game, and another five 
in the most recent engagement -
four of which were scored in the 
first quarter, helping to give his 
team a decisive 5 -1 advantage early 
in the competition. 

The multifaceted Cardinal 
offense turned the attention from 
Azevedo after the first quarter in 
order to keep the Triton defense 
working hard. Junior driver Peter 
Varellas netted two goals in the sec-
ond period that, complemented by 
two other unchallenged Stanford 
goals, contributed to a 9-1 halftime 
lead for the Cardjnal. 

Sophomore utility Joe 
Woodring scored for the Tritons 
midway through the third period, 
the only Triton goal of the quarter 
and his only shot of the match. 
Stanford was restricted to three 

scores . in the third, giving the 
Cardinal their biggest lead of the 
game with a 10-point, 12-2 mar-
gin. 

UCSD seemed to have decided 
to start playing the way it was 
accustomed to in the beginning of 
the fourth quarter. The Tritons 
outscored Stanford, 5-3, courtesy 
of a late-game hat trick by fresh-
man driver Adnan Jerkovic and 
individual goals by freshman dri-
vers Curtis Williamson and Jeff 
Hunt. By the time the game clock 
sounded the end of the match, 
UCSD had reduced the difference 
to eight, ultimately losing 15-7. 

Finegold's recor~ for drawing 
seven ejections in a single game is 
noteworthy for the Tritons, who 
are typically able to effectively cap-
italize on man-up opportunities. If 
UCSD can use this sort of advan-
tage more effectively in the future, 
the team will have an ace up its 
sleeve by the time of the Western 
Water Polo Association 
Championship, between Nov. 18 
and Nov. 20 at UC Davis. 

The Tritons continue their 
homestand with a noon game 
against No.7 UC Irvine on Oct. 31 
at Canyonview Pool. UCSD lost to 
the Anteaters by a 13-6 margin in 

Tritons take second-straight· loss 
UCSD misses chance to clinch playoff berth 
By CYNTHIA BLADE CHAVEZ 

Associate Sports Editor 

The No. 25 UCSD women's 
soccer team returned home after a 
loss on Oct. 23 looking to bounce 
back with a win against Cal Poly 
Pomona on Oct. 2-5. However, the 
Broncos had other plans and 
handed the Tritons their second-
straight loss in a close, 4-3 battle. 
Cal Poly Pomona's junior forward 
Erica Rodriguez scored the game-
winner with less than eight min-
utes remaining. Losing back-to-
back games is a first for UCSD 
women 's soccer since its move to 
Division II in 2000. 

As of Oct. 25, the Tritons were 
tied for first in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
South Division with Cal State 
Dominguez Hills and were one 
point ahead of Cal Poly Pomona 
with two games remaining in the 
regular season. UCSD needs only 
one more win to earn a berth in 
the postseason, and winning its 
last two games would have 
clinched a fifth consecutive outh 
Division title for the women 's soc-
cer program. 

"We're still going to be in the 
conference playoffs," UCSD head 
coach Brian McManus said . "As 
far as I'm concerned, [this loss] 
was a great learning experience for 
them, and we're going to take it 
from there." 

The teams proved to be evenly 
matched, with both exploding 
offensively and trading leads three 
times to keep things interesting 
for the 329 fans in attendance. 

"It was a great game," 
McManus said. "That was proba-
bly one of the best games to watch 
the whole year, and it was just our 
lack of experience [that caused the 
loss]. We dwelt on a couple of 
mistakes a little bit, and when you 
do that against good teams, expe-
rienced teams with exoerienced 
players, it can cost you .- and it

Heartbreaker: Sophomore forward Kelly Cochran (above) and the UCSD

cost us." 

The loss dropped UCSD to 
12-3-1 overall and 8-3-1 in the 
CCAA, while Cal Poly Pomona 
improved to 8-6-3 overall and 7-
2-3 in the CCAA. 

Although the Tritons lost, 
McManus was pleased with the 
efforts of his players. 

"Tonight, I'm not even the 
least bit upset," he said. "I thought 
they played well. Like I said to our 
players, [Cal Poly Pomona] can 
only win if we make our own mis-
takes, and we made our own mis-
takes. But I think we played, we 
scored three great goals, and on 
any other day that game would've 
been a win. We won't make four 
mistakes like that in a game again, 
that's for sure." 

In the opening half, the 
Broncos drew first blood when 
freshman forward and San Diego 
native Jacqueline Ragudos came 

off the bench to lob the ball over 
Triton senior goalie Jamie 
Lautenschleger in the 24th 
minute. Ragudos scored off a pass 
from junior mid fielder Chelsea 
Hipley, who stole the ball from a 
Triton in midfield to set up 
Ragudos' goal. Determined not to 
go into halftime behind, UCSD 
fought back with a goal by sopho-
more mid fielder Heather Sugg 
with less than four minutes 
remaining. The Tritons have 
found success all season on corner 
kicks, and thjs time junior defend-
er Kristina De La Rosa placed a 
perfect pass to Sugg, who headed 
in the ball to keep it even at half-
time. 

Both teams broke loose in the 
second half, scoring five goals 
between them. Sugg struck again 
with a header off a pass from

86th minute against Pomona 
Two consecutive overtime losses 

stunt Tritons' playoff berth 
By RAIL ENTEEN 

Staff Writer 

Despite a 3-2 double-overtime 
loss to the Cal Poly Pomona 
Broncos on Oct. 25, the UCSD 
men's soccer team looks poised to 
gain a spot in the California 
Col1egiate Athletic Association 
playoffs with two games against 
league foes in the next week. 

Following road losses to Cal 
State San Bernardino and Cal State 
Monterey Bay on Oct. 6 and Oct. 
10, it looked like the Tritons would 
have to stay home in November 
during the CCAA Championship. 
Since then, the Tritons have gone 
2-2 with overtime losses in their 
last two games. However, Chico 
State and Cal State Los Angeles, 
the Tritons' main competition for a 
playoff spot, have both been play-
ing subpar soccer, keeping UCSD 
in the hunt. This caliber of play is 
not typical of UCSD, which played 
well in late October last year, going 
5 -1-0 and earning a spot in the 
CCAA playoffs, and eventually the 
NCAA playoffs. 

The Tritons were hoping for a 
similar ending this year, but the 
Broncos poured onto RlMAC 
Field, where UCSD was previously 
undefeated, and played the role of 
spoilers. 

The first period looked like 
each of the Tritons' last four games, 
with a scoreless first half. Each 
team had rune shots, but both 
defenses shut down every scoring 
opportunity. So far this year, Triton 
defense has dominated through 
both halves, keeping UCSD in 
games that it could have easily lost. 

The game against the Broncos, 
however, did not stay scoreless for 
lon, after the stan of the second 
hal . Triton sophomore midfielder 
German Bravo took a rebound off a 

save by Broncos goalie Jeff Coombs 
and tapped it to the back of the net 
to give UCSD a 1-0 lead in the 
57th minute. Junior midfielder 
Matthew Davey and sophomore 
defenseman Dustin Tannenhaus 
were credited with assists. 

Less than 10 minutes later, the 
Triton offense took advantage of a 
scoring opportunity .and length-
ened UCSD's lead on a beautifully 
placed lob shot over .coombs by 
junior forward Jon Krupansky, who 
was set up by junior midfielder 
Grant Nishio. 

With a 2-0 lead in the 65th 
minute and a home crowd behind 
them, the Tritons were poised to 
win the game and gain momentum 
going into the playoffs. The 
Broncos would not quit, however, 
and slowly cut away at the Tritons' 
lead. Broncos midfielder Dustin 
Venegas took advantage of a 
UCSD turnover and turned it into 
an unassisted goal that cut the 
Tritons' lead in half in the 70th 
minute. 

Cal Poly Pomona didn~t stop 
there, netting another goal in the 
86th minute to knot the match up 
at two goals apiece. Once again it 
was Venegas who scored on UCSD 
senior goalie Scott Mazurier, this 
time off a free kick. 

"The first goal was a stupid mis-
take, and that gave them momen-
tum," Mazurier said. "Then they 
came at us strong because they had 
nothing to lose and we weren't very 
organized. We kind oflost our con-
trol and confidence." 

Mazurier had six saves in the 
game, but eventually allowed the 
winning score to Broncos midfield-
er Ben Van Der Fluit at the 105 :49 
minute mark in the second over-
time period. Mid6elder Joe DeVito
