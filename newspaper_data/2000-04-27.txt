NEW YORK - Americans who 
have invested in European stock 
markets this year have been dealt a 
cruel blow by the euro, which 
seems to be on a relentless decline. 

On the surface, the news from 
abroad is good. While the major 
American equity indexes are down 
or flat for the year, some promi-
nent European stock indexes have 
posted gains.

A.S. Senators Guy Berger, Shige ltoh and Kevin McGinnis resign, 1UJ 
longer wishing to be part of council after its failed impeachment vote 

~sEditor 

Three senators resigned Wednesday night after 
the A.s. Council failed to gather enough votes to 
impeach A.S. President Tesh Khullar, Vice 
President Internal .Jennifer Lee and Vice President 
Finance Eric Rovner. 

Muir Senior Senator Guy Berger, Muir 
Sophomore Senator Shige ltoh and Warren Senior 
Senator Kevin McGinnis turned in their letters of 
resignation to A.S. Executive Secretary Anna 
Mason immediately following the reading of the 
impeachment vote, which failed. 

Ml'm no longer willinito remain in office with 
people who have willful lied to the students of 
UCSD and repeatedly re use to take responsibility 

for their actions: Berger said. 
He added that Khullar, Lee and Rovner 

attempted to conceal their actions until they were 
discovered by a fellow student. 

Berger also said the executives involved owe all 
students an apology for what they have done, 
regardless of the consequences they may face. 

Khullar said that while he disagrees with the 
senators' decision to resign, he felt they had a right 
to do so. 

"I have issues about that personally, but that is 
their prerogative. If they feel they need to resign 
for that issue to make [a) statement, then that is 
their intent, and that is fine,· he said. "I am sad to 
see them leave because they are all valued mem-

asks for resignations; 
vote to impeach fails 

By MAn SCHRADER 
ASSOCiate News Editor 

The A.S. Council fell two votes 
short of impeaching A.S. President 
Tesh Khullar, Vice President Internal 
Jennifer Lee and Vice President 
Finance Eric Rovner after a special 
A.S. committee requested that the 
three executives resign for falsifying 
receipts that were reimbursed with 
student funds. 

Khullar, Lee and Rovner were 
investigated by the committee after 
attending a ew York City leadership 
conference in March. After three 
interview sessions with the confer-
ence attendants, the committee found 
that the executives falsified receipts 
upon their return from ew York. 

"I don't even have a reaction: 
Khullar said. "I was shocked, sur-
prised, and then at the same time a 
little bit reaffirmed because there are 
enough people on council that felt 
they didn't know the facts and could-
n't vote on something like this." 

Muir Senior Senat~r Guy Berger 
said he supported the move to 
impeach the three executives. 

"They falsified receipts that are 
public records and then attempted to 
cover it up by not coming forward 
until they were confronted," Berger 
said. "I don't think it's respectful. I 
think it's completely immoral con-
duct for anybody on the A.S. 
[Council) to engage in, especially 
executives who are given the public'S 
trust."

from the university police, 
Philadelphia Fire Department, the 
FBI, the University Office of 
Environmental Health and a federal 
counter-terrorism task force were on 
site to close the building and investi-
gate the matter. 

FBI investigators now say the pow-
der was harmfess. 

Neither Hillel leaders nor univer-
sity police were able to speculate on 
exactly who could have sent the 
threatening piece of mail. 

Officials from the jewish com-
munity group say the timing of the 
incident may be connected to a hol-
iday last week commemorating the 
Holocaust and the April 20 
anniversary of the birth of Adolf 
Hitler. 

The initial belief of investigators is 
that the letter came from an individ-
ual with little or no affiliation with the 
university. 

University police and the FBI will 
continue to investigate the incident.

BRIEFLY 

Students Named Beckman Scholars 
Four undergraduate students at UCSD have 

been selected to receive awards from the Arnold 
and Mabel Beckman Foundation that will allow 
them to participate in prolonged academic 
research projects with UCSD faculty members in 
the sciences. 

The UCSD students are among 71 under-
graduate students from 18 institutions nation-
wide who were named as Beckman Scholars for 
the 2000-2001 academic year. Each will receive 
$11,000 for two, 10-week long summers of full-
time research, beginning tnis summer, and 
53,600 for up to 10 hours per week of research 
during the intervening academic year. 

The UCSD students, all of whom will be 
juniors this fall, their majors and the faculty 
members they plan to work with are: 

Megan Bowers of Davis, Calif.; molecular biol-
ogy; working with Ethan Bier, professor of biology. 

Judy Hwang of Fontana, Calif.; chemistry and 
biochemistry; working with Yitzhak To, associate 
professor of chemistry and biochemistry. 

Stephen Waldo of Arcadia, Calif.; bioengi-
neering; working with Geert Schmid-
Schoenbein, professor of bioengineering. 

Aaron Wang of Cupertino, Calif.; bioengi-
neering; working with Robert Sah, associate pro-
fessor of bioengineering. 

The Beckman Scholars Awards to these stu-
dents are designed to help stimulate, encourage 
and support exceptionally talented undergradu-
ates in prolonged academic research projects in 
chemistry, biochemistry or the biological or 
medical sciences. 

He said the highly competitive nature of the 
selection probably makes this undergraduate 
research award the most/restigious at UCSD. 
The winners were selecte on the basis of their 
research proposals, leners of recommendation 
and academic records. 

The university also had to compete in a rigor-
ous proc~ss against 797 other institutions across 
the country for the chance to allow its students 
to compete for the prestigious research awards. 
The successful proposal was prepared by a facul-
ty committee that included Sah and representa-
tives from the biology, chemistrylbiochemistry 
and bioengineering departments.

LopIccoIa Foundation GIves 
$120,000 to Fund 1.larch 

The Pete Lopiccola Memorial Foundation 
gave $120,000 to fund cancer treatment and 

. research at the UCSD Cancer Center. The non-

Memorial Marlin Tournament, which is held in 
Cabo San Lucas. Mexico. Pete Lopiccola was a 
boat captain and avid fisherman who lost his life 
to leu)cemia in 1988. The tournament, which has

the West Coast, was founded to honor his mem-
ory and raise money to support cancer research. 

This year's check was presented on April 14 at 
a reception at UCSD's Thornton Hospital. Guests 
heard brief presentations by four UCSD Cancer 
Center research fellows. V'lXUe Cao, !san Chen,

Council: 
Three executives await 
Judicial Board hearing 
CoIItIMed rro. ..... 1 
the meeting due to the council's 
decision not to impeach the three 
executives, said the councilmem-
bers in question should lose their 
offices as a result of their intention-
al actions. 

"Not only did they deliberately 
... attempt to lie to the students of 
UCSD, they tried to cover it up," 
Berger said. "If we let these people 
remain in office, we are basically 
saying that we are willing to let 
people that lie to you and falsify 
public records to remain in 
office." 

The committee's report called 
for the three executives' resigna-
tion, effective at the end of the 
meeting. After the committee 
report was read, the A.S. Council 
closed the meeting to the public. 
When the meeting reopened to 
the public, the councilmembers 
were discussing an- impeachment 
vote. 

The.impeachment, which need-
ed three-fourths approval from the 
A.S. senators, failed by a 12-2-4 
vote. 

"It 'wasn't a surprise, but I still 
don't understand why people are 
abstaining," said Warren Senior 
Senator Kevin McGinnis. "I am fed 
up with people not willing to take a 
stance." 

Khullar said he was not pleased 
by the vote. 

"I am disturbed that 12 people 
would want my impeachment," 
KhuUar said. "I am not mad at any-
body. Obviously you come out a 
linle bit disappointed." 

Khullar added that the lack of 
support from councilmembers has 

not discouraged his motivation as 
president. 

"I didn't care too much about 
public opinion," he said. "I didn't 
care too much about what people 
think. I wanted to be efficient and 
get stuff done." 

Revelle Senior Senator Troy 
Pulas, a member of the committee 
that investigated the trip, said he 
was disappointed by the result of 
the vote. 

"To keep them in office is a dis-
credit to us and a discredit to our 
committee that was formed to 

«Not only did they 
deliberately .. , attempt 
to lie to the students of 
UCSD) they tried to 
cover it up. Iflve let 
these people remain in 
office) we are basically 
saying that we are 
willing to let people that 
lie to you and falsify 
public records to remain 
in office,» 

-Guy Bert., 
Muir senior senator 

investigate this," he said. · We had 
all the knowledge .. . and the coun-
cil as a whole didn't take our 
advice." 

Pulas said in the meeting that 
he thought the executives should 
step down from their offices. 

" I think they did a dishonor to 
[the A.S. Council] and the rest of 
the students." he said. "What they 
did from an ethical and legal posi-
tion warrants them resigning." 

The UCSD Guardian 
Khullar said he believes the sen-

ators failed to impeach Lee, Rovner 
and himself because the A.S. 
Council lacked information neces-
sary to pass such legislation. 

"I think if there was enough evi-
dence for people to say that I was 
guilty and this was the proper pun-
ishment for what I did, then I 
would have been impeached," he 
said. "We can only guess that if [the 
voting senators] had some more 
information, then maybe the 
results [of the impeachment vote] 
might have been a little bit differ-
ent." 

Despite being cleared of all A.S. 
charges, the three executives still 
face possible consequences from 
the judicial Board. KhuIJar said the 
judicial Board can order communi-
ty service, probation or suspension 
from the university. 

Pulas said he does not agree 
with the council's decision but 
believes that this case should con-
cern only the A.S. Council. He said 
punishment for the officers should 
be decided solely by the A.S. 
Council. 

"I was surprised that people 
didn't believe that [Lee, Khullar 
and Rovner] shouldn't be taken off 
[the A.S. Council)," Pulas said. "I 
think if any punishment should 
have been given to them, it should 
have been by the A.S. [Council]." 

Khullar, who has admitted to 
forging receipts, said he is willing to 
accept any punishment that the 
Judicial Board jurors recommend. 

"[Regardless of our intent), we 
shouldn't have done that, and we 
did admit to that, and we are going 
to face the consequences of the 
university; he said. 

KhuJlar said that he will not let 
these issues influence his responsi-
bilities as A.S. president. during his 
final week in office. 

"I am going to continue to do 
what I promised I would do when I

Charges Ag,Hnst 
Web Site Unfounded 

The UCSD administration recently 
threatened legal action against the student-
run online network The Daily Jolt for 
including uUCSD" in the Web site's address 
(which was formerly www.ucsd.dailyjolt.com). 
The rationale the administration gave for 
the action was that "UCSD" is the intellec-
tual property of the University of California. 
The Daily Jolt responded by changing the 
address for the UCSD section of the Web 
site. 

The Guardian believes that discretion is 
the better part of valor. Just because the 
University of California has the legal right 
to sue companies for using its name does 
not mean that it necessarily should. In this 
case the university's actions are completely 
unwarranted: the Web site was not passing 
itself off as an official part of the university, 
nor attempting to profit from or take credit 
for any of its accomplishments. The univer-
sity is only acting as a bully by overreacting 
on such a petty matter. 

The Daily Jolt serves as a useful refer-
ence for UCSD students, listing upcoming 
events on and off campus, listing business 
hours for libraries, stores and advising 
offices and listing related Web links that 
might interest students on this campus. 
The inclusion of "UCSD" in the URL is 
only appropriate given the emphasis of the 
Web site - it is not an underhanded 
attempt to pass itself off as an official 
UCSD site. Besides, anyone who doesn't 
realize that a Web site that ends with -
".com" rather than ".edu" isn't an official 
educationai site needs to brush up on his 
Internet fundamentals. 

A college campus is more than just a 
school for students. It is their home and an 
important part of their lives. The universi-
ty's treatment of its name like a trademark 
only serves to belittle its significance for the 
people who call it home and have a vested 
interest in the community it fosters. Cities 
do not sue businesses for using their names 
in conjunction with commercial services -
witness the Los Angeles TImes, the San Diego 
Padres or La Jolla Cleaners. Why should a 
university be so defensive about the use of 
its name? 

Universities are important cultural com-
munities, and it does. not serve anyone's 
best interest to react with heavy-handed lit-
igation whenever someone happens to ref-
erence their name. The administration 
should call off its anal-retentive legal attack 
dogs and accept the mention of its name as 
merely the recognition of UCSD's cultural 
importance.

Supreme Court Poses the Latest Threat 
to California's Open Primary 
The national political parties are rallying against the implementation of Proposition 
198 and threaten the future of California'S democratic experiment 
., •• ENT DON 
Opinion Editor 

Disillusioned Californians are 
becoming increasingly aware that the 
open primary they overwhelmingly 
voted for in Proposition 198 in 1996 is 
being subverted by national interests. 
The first blow came from the national 
political parties, which made it clear 
that they would not be compelled to 
consider the votes of non-party voters 
in nominating a candidate in the 2000 
primary, effectively undermining the 
entire point of the open system. More 
recently, California's open primary has 
been subjected to intense criticism by 
an institution whose lack of support for 
California's voters is even more dis-
heartening: the Supreme Court, which 
is currently reviewing the legislation. 

California Special Assistant Attorney 
General Thomas Gede has fended off 
vicious attacks from opponents of the 
open primary and faced unsympathetic 
questioning from conservative Justices. 
Justice Antonin Scalia attacked 
California's system as "democracy car-
ried to the extreme.· Heaven forbid we 
should do anything that might further 
the cause of democracy in this country. 
Judging from the progress of the hear-
ings, it seems that California's open pri~ 
mary system is in danger of being struck 
down by the United States' judiciary. 

One of the central arguments levied 
against the open primary is that it 
infringes on the political parties' First 
Amendment rights. Lawyers for the 
four political parties on California's 
ballot claim that the open primary 
forces political parties to support can-
didates who do not really exemplify the 
ideals of their party in order to try to 
win votes. This is preposterous. By this 
flawed reasoning, the entire political 
process is unconstitutional, because ;t 
forces political parties to endorse can-
didates that have a chance of winning 

If the political parties want 
to win California, they will 
have to produce more 
moderate candidates. That 
is all. there is to it. If they 
cannot stomach this, they 
will just have to resign 
themselves to losing 
California. 
the election, regardless of whether they 
represent the ideology of the party. It is 
not the system's fault if the political 
parties produce unpopular candidates; 
it is the parties' own fault for not ade-
quately representing the political 
beliefs of the people. The Supreme 
Court has no right putting the interests 
of political parties over a mandate of 
the voters. 

The court's reasoning that the open 
primary will force political parties to 
compromise their ideals by nominating 
moderate candidates that appeal to 
independents and members of other 
parties is shockingly obtuse. What do 
they think is going on in American pol-
itics .today? They cannot possibly be 
una.ware of the national parties' current 
strate$y of fielding candidates that 
intentionally straddle both sides of the 
political fence. Maybe they missed ·the 
fact that the presidential forerunners AI 
Gore and George W. Bush have both 
been subjected to sharp criticism. They 
have been accused of compromising 
their party ideology in order to appeal 
to other constituencies. 

If the political p'arties want to win 
California, they will have to produce 
more moderate candidates. That is all 
there is to it. If they cannot stomach 
this, they will just have to rqlgnt\l~m­
selves to losing Califotnia. There IS no 

law saying that states have to cater to 
the whims of the political parties -
indeed, democratic ideals suggest that 
just the opposite should be true. 

When it comes down to it, the attack 
on the open primary system is merely a 
defense of the supremacy of the 
Democratic and Republican Parties. 
The Libertarian Party and the Peace 
and Freedom Party of California are 
deluded in thinking that they are fur-
thering their own interests by opposing 
the open primary; without it they are 
doomed to wallow in the obscurity and 
ineffectiveness that has so far marred 
their existence. They should be sup-
porting the open primary system rather 
than perpetuating their own impotence. 

California has been bullied for too 
long by national entities bent on inval-
idating its sovereign decision to con-
duct elections as its voters see fit. It is 
time to take a stand on this issue and 
de~end the open primary that California 
voters mandated. The justices are cor-
rect in recognizing the political impact 
of California - the Union's most pop-
ulous state is home to more than 10 
percent of the nation's voters, and the 
political actions of the state's voters 
have far-reaching consequences for the 
rest of the nation. If the open primary 
fails in California, it will be a blow to 
other states that have implemented or 
are thinking of implementing open pri-
maries. 

American political parties are not 
legally established or protected govern-
ment institutions. The idea that the 
Supreme Court would even consider 
putting the protection of political par-
ties over the rights of the American 
people is incredibly disturbing. The 
Supreme Court has long been the cata-
lyst of political and social reform in this 
country; for it to become the defender 
of the status quo is a terrifying prospect

A.S. Executive Council Owes Me 33 Cents 
The infamous $5,400 trip to New York that has recently come to light 
cost UCSD students a third of a dollar each - and it's paybQck..Jime 
., IlIUM TAIKD 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Yesterday, I was digging in my 
pocltet for a quarter to feed the 
parking meter and came up 
empty. While I was able to find a 
lot of lint, some flyers and a cough 
drop, unfortunately I couldn't find 
any change. Lately, I've been 
thinking a lot about where my 
change goes. Maybe it's just 
senioritis and fear of unemploy-
ment kicking in, but now every 
time I walk around campus 1 think 
of places where I've spent money. 

For instance, I was in the Price 
Center recently and looked up, 
realizing that I had a prime view of 
the A.S. Council offices on the 
third floor. It was then that I began 
thinking about how many of my 
quarters have gone toward our 
student government. 

In all honestly, before this 
quarter, it never really bothered 
me thar I fork over a few bucks 
each quarter to the A.S. Council. 
After all, I always assumed that the 
council, filled with people with 
some very impressive resumes, 
would be wise enough to spend 
money responsibly. This was 
before I learned of the recent A.S. 
Council scandal. 

For those of you who don't 
know, the A.S. executive council, 
comprised of the president and 
three vice presidents. are currently 
being investigated for going on a 
very expensive trip to New York in 
order to attend a conference. 
Their trip cost a mere $5,400. 

Now, some people might call 
me cheap, but I know that you can 
take a perfectly nice trip to New 
York for less than $5,400. In fact, 

I've talked to a lot of 
students who think that 
the executive council 
members should be 
impeached for their trip 
and receipt forging. 
Frankly, I don't care 
what happens to the 
executive council 
members; whether 
they're impeached has 
no bearing on my 
pocketbook. 
I spent the summer between my 
junior and senior years interning 
for 12 weeks in New York and 
managed to spend way less than 
$5,400 - including airfare. 

Back to the executive council 
members' trip. On their voyage to 
New York, the four members of 
the council stayed in a $350 hotel 
room in Times Square, attended 
less than half the meetings at their 
conference and toured a number 
of city sights. such as Harlem. 

As if that's not bad enough, it 
turns out that some members of 
the executive council forged 
receipts to get reimbursed for 
money spent on the trip. My per-
sonal favorite forged receipt is of 
a fabricated 46-mile cab drive in 
Manhattan . 

I find this especially interest-
ing because the area of 
Manhattan is only 23 square 
miles. Now, I'm all for sight-
seeing, but this is ridiculous. 

PICK UP 

After all, you can only drive 
around the Empire State 
Building so many times before it 
starts to get boring. 

I've talked to a lot of students 
who think that the executive 
council members should be 
impeached for their trip and 
receipt forging. Frankly, I don't 
care what happens to the execu-
tive council members; whether 
they're impeached has no .bearing 
on my pocltetbook. 

I've decided that the best way 
to deal with the situation is for 
the executive council members 
to reimburse the students for the 
money they spent on the trip. 

There are approximately 
16,000 undergraduates regis-
tered at UCSD and the council 
members spent $5,400 on the 
trip. So, if we divide $5,400 by 
16,000, we wind up with an aver-
age cost of approximately 33 
cents per student. This means 
the executive council spent 33 
cents of my money touring New 
York City. 

I'm sure many of you are 
thinking to yourself that I'm nuts. 
You're thinking I should just for-
get about the 33 cents and move 
on with my life. Well, I don 't want 
to. I'm a senior and I have right to 
be petty. In case you haven't 
heard, pettiness is a byproduct of 
spending four years driving in cir-
cles trying to find a parking spot. 1 
want my 33 cents back and I want 
it now. 

Fellow students, I suggest that 
you follow my lead and ask for 
your money back as well . Like 
anyone who buys a faulty product, 
we deserve a refund.

The Fine Art of ~owing 
Everyone lends out CDs to their friends, but some 
handle the responsibility better than others 

Columnist 

Based on the suggestion of one 
of my critics, I have decided to 
devote this week's column to CD-
borrowing etiquette. No doubt we 
have all participated in the game of 
swapping CDs and must understand 
that each player in this game has his 
or her own set of rules on how to 
play. Therefore, the etiquene that 
one must follow is subjective 
depending on the person whom one 
is dealing with. Several types of peo-
ple exist and each belongs in his or 
her own category. 

Flt'St, there is the "borrow for life" 
type. They ask to borrow a CD and 
you willingly agree. Several weeks 
pass, then months, then maybe 
years. It is possible that you forgot 
about the CD over the extended 
time and the other person ended up 
one CD richer. 

There is a counter-attack to this 
type of borrower. For instance, a 
mend borrowed a CD from me 
before Christmas break last year. 
Months passed and I was deter-
mined not to let myself forget about 
the CD. So I borrowed one of his. 
This way, if he decides never to 
return it or somehow keeps it over 
summer break, 1 have one of his 
CDs held for ransom and will be 
sure to get mine back eventually. 

Next there is the "24-hour bor-
rower." These are the people that 
always return their one-day rental 
movies on time and feel like they 
have to do the same when borrow-
ing. Don't get me wrong, it is nice to 
have friends that are so prompt in 
the returning process, but then it 
makes me feel obliged to return any 
CDs I borrowed from them right 

away, too. It is fun to know that other 
people want to listen to your music, 
and it is almost offending when they 
only borrow it for one day. It is 
almost like saying that your music 
wasn't good enough for them - but 
that is their loss anyway. 

Then, of course. there is that 
"constant reminder" person. This is 
the person who always finds a way to 
mention that you have his or her CD 
every time you see each other. If this 
person really wanted it back that 
badly, then he or she could come 
and get it instead of making it a 
point to remind you that you have it. 
If people would just say straight out 
that they wanted their CD back. it 
would be better than a thinly veiled 
reminder that you have it. 

There is also the "reluctant" type. 
This is someone whom you ask to 
borrow a CD from, yet as soon as 
you take it, he or she will miss it. 
More often than not, he or she will 
agree to let you borrow it, but with 
the understanding that it means a lot 
and if you could return it as soon as 
possible that would be fine. If not 
they will come and beat down your 
door for it. 

Finally, there are what I call the 
"ultimate" people to borrow from. 
When you ask to borrow a CD 
from them, they are more than 
eager to let you, but then they 
decide to just give you the CD to 
keep instead. Or if they don't give it 
to you, they burn you a copy of it. 
If only there were more people like 
this in the world. 

Of course, these categories may 
be limited, and you could fall into a 
completely different category, like 
the person who quips: "just down-
load the songs you want and add 
them to your MP3 list."

6 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Thursday, April 27, 2000 

The Real Solution to Public Transportation Will Come from ;Entrepreneurs 
Editor: 
Simone Santini's recent piece 

on the need for mass-transit 
("Californians Must Give Up 
Their Love of the Car if Mass 
Transit is to Succeed: April 20) is 
yet another example of his Soviet-
era top-down thinking. The prob-
lem of lengthy commutes, the 
author says, can only be solved by 
government mass-transit spend-
ing. Without the guiding hand of 
the state, without a committee of 
great minds planning our travels 
to and from work, our lives will be 
miserable. 

There are a lot of sophisticated 
angles that one could take in eval-
uating Santini's proposals, but 
let's see what we can learn about 
transponation issues by invoking 
the following simple idea from 
Glenn Frey's song, Smuggler's. 
Blues: "The lure of easy 
money/It's got a very strong 
appeal." 

The first thing we can learn 
from the Frey Axiom is that car-
pools are clearly a bad choice for 
most people. How do we know 
that? Because carpools are easy to 
organize and cost nothing to run 
(especially via the Internet), and 
they save lots of money, yet we 
don't see many people carpooling. 
So, since we know that people 
don't overlook easy ways to save 
money, we can conclude that the 
costs of carpooling - which 
mostly involve the loss of autono-
my - outweigh the cash savings. 
Freedom trumps cash . 

The second thing the Frey 
Axiom can teach us is that entre-
preneurs have a strong incentive 
to cut our drive times. Santini is 
right when he says that there's a 
strong demand for short com-
mutes, and in the United States, 
there's always an entrepreneur 
trying to sell us what we want. 

Example: When entrepreneurs 
saw hundreds of thousands of 
people commuting every day from 
Riverside to LA, they saw a profit 
opportunity. Their thinking went 
something like this: "These poor 

schmucks are willing to drive 100 
miles for a job that pays 10 bucks 
an hour. I'll move my factory from 
LA out to Riverside, offer jobs at -
eight bucks an hour, and I'll get 
Riverside soccer moms lined up 
out the door for a job that'll shave 
four hours off their daily com-
mute." 

Riverside County is now a 
hotbed of job growth. The entre-
preneur's greed takes traffic off 
the freeways, all without a single 
dollar of taxpayers' money. 

Since my idea of a good time is 
using jargon and citing authori-
ties, ['11 finish with a quote by 
Peter Gordon, a professor at 
USC's School of Policy, Planning 
and Development. Among other 
things, Gordon has shown that 
the average commute hasn't 
changed in the last 15 years, large-
ly because jobs move close to 
workers and workers move close 
to jobs. 

Gordon says, "People are pan of 
a spontaneous order. [ think it's not 
only pessimistic but even ignorant 
to believe that people are going to 
sit tight while their lives go to hell." 
(hltpj/reason.armI9806lje.gordon.hlmi) 

So, there you have it . The 
actions of thousands of entrepre-
neurs who want to boost profits, 
along with millions of workers 
who hate their long commutes, 
are already doing a shockingly 
good job shortening commute 
times. Any government-organized 
system of mass transit will have to 
do better than the spontaneous 
order created as each of us pur-
sues our self-interest . Let a thou-
sand freeways bloom .

UCSD Students 
DemonstIate Apathy 

Editor: 
Once again UCSD students 

have showcased their apathy 
when it comes to anything but 
their O-chem midterms. The 
Guardian's April 24 Arena ques-
tioned students' lack of panicipa-
tion in voting in the recent A.S. 
elections. Unfortunately, the 
majority of those polled hid 
behind the same weak excuse: 
"Because I didn't know." One stu-
dent backed his claim by whining 
that "no one ever told me about 
it." What was he expecting, that 
the candidates would show up on 
his doorstep? 

There was ample opportunity 
to learn about the candidates and 
what they stood for. Per~onally, I 
told over 200 people to vote, 
instructed them on how to vote, 
handed out more than 50 sample 

ballots so people would know 
who was running and made 
announcements in classrooms 
that read, "Hey guess what? 
Elections are happening!" 

[n addition to public and tele-
vised debates, the candidates had 
posters, T-shins. flyers, stickers, 
candy, balloons ... more than a 
definite "presence" around cam-
pus for the two weeks before the 
polls closed. The voting page even 
had links to the candidates' Web 
sites. Anyone who lifted his or her 
nose out of their books for five 
seconds would know exactly who 
was running and how to find out 
about the candidates' platforms. 
['m sorry if the candidates could-
n't come hold your hand to walk 
you over to a nearby computer so 
you could take three lJlinutes out 
of your life and vote in probably 
the most convenient method 
available. [ guess they were 
focused more on getting to the 
voters who do care about the 
future of students at UCSD. 

The Guardian published an 
editorial on April 20 offering pos-
sible reasons why voter turnout 
was so low. I acquiesce that there 
should have been more kiosks in 
strategic areas to coerce students 
to cast their vote. [ hardly believe 
that a lack of incentive (free soda 
... whoopdeedoo) is a valid 
excuse; neither is the thought that 
students would miss the physical 
process of punching the hole into 
the ballot. If that's the reason stu-
dents didn't vote, they can call me, 
and ('II give them some bubble 
wrap to play with . 

The fact that students could 
vote 24 hours a day, from any-
where - in their underwear if 
need be - should have increased 
turnout. The "I didn't have time" 
excuse just doesn't fly. So, unless 
you were deep in the jungle with 
no I nternet access, or maybe if 
you were deathly ill, then that 
might be a valid excuse. 
Otherwise, get off your lazy,

While Elian Gonzalez's removal was dramatic, it 
wasn't another disaster like Waco or Ruby Ridge 

The Rebel Yell (U. NevBd~LB5 Vegas) 

(U-WlRE) LAS VEGAS - The 
recent events in the Elian 
Gonzalez international custody 
battle are shocking to many, but 
for different reasons. Some are 
surprised the government would 
take such action to return a child 
back JO a totalitarian communist 
dictatorship. After all, his mother 
perished trying to bring him to 
freedom and a better life in 
America. 

Those who know the history of 
the federal government are sur-
prised that scaring Elian by point-
ing a machine gun at him, tear-
gassing the crowd and throwing a 
woman to the ground would be 
the qnly damage. 

Jane.! Reno and the various 
governmental agencies under her 
control deserve praise for 
improvement. 

Remember Waco, Texas? That 
51-day siege ending in the burn-
ing death of 80, including young 
children was sparked when feder-
al agents grew angry over the 
non-payment of taxes. Armed 
men instead of diplomacy called 
upon the Branch Davidians, a sect 
of the Seventh Day Adventists. 

Thank goodness Reno and her 
cronies learned. [f they didn't, we 
could assume Janet is as slow as 
those cowpokes in her namesake, 
"the biggest little city in the 
world." 

Reno recently admined cover-
ing up that her shock troops used 
fire-causing grenades they admit 
may have sparked that deadly fire. 
The debate still rages on whether 
or not the government troops 
continued firing as the church 
burned, thus preventing anyone 
from escaping. 

More recently in the Ruby 
Ridge standoff, a mother holding 
her child was killed by a sniper. 

[n Miami, the feds miraculous-
ly did not directly kill anybody. 
Elian could be killed after hIS 
father returns him to Cuban soil, 
especially if he remembers the 
opportunities there are in 
America. He might spread anti-

Editor: 
[ am writing in response to the 

anicle written by Simone Santini 
entitled "Science Cannot Verify 
the Truth of the Bible" (April 24). 
After reading and rereading the 

[n America we know how cor-
rupt the two panies system is, but 
imagine if there was no counter-
point whatsoever? 

Some correctly point to 
American hypocrisy for even con-
sidering allowing Cubans to stay 
in the U.S., since they are escap-
ing Castro caused poveny, while 
returning poor Haitians. 

To be fair, America should be 
open to all . America should be the 
land of the free and the home of 
the brave, not the land of the priv-
ileged and the home of those 
scared of foreign competition. 

Would allowing the world to 
immigrate here shut down our 
cushy safety net? Probably, but 
are those who want to come to 
America and work to make a bet-
ter life for their families less 
deserving of an opponunity? 

The unions say yes, because 
with competition from Mexicans, 
they cannot make $45 an hour 
putting up fences. 

This is pure selfishness on the 
part of those who have taken part 
In America's relative freedom, but 
seek to deny that freedom to oth-
ers. 

To embody the modem spirit 
of America we cannot just force 
other countries to pay American 
wages, such as those crusading 
against sweatshops. We need to 
allow open borders and allow all 
humans on this planet to move 
from subsistence farming to more 
efficient careers, which will allow 
knowledge and opportunity. 

America cannot survive by 
providing wealth for all in our 
country, regardless of their efforts, 
but peopie in Haiti, Cuba and any 
other country should be free to 
come here and work at whatever 
they can. 

They might take a job above 
me, such as computer program-
ming, but that is their right to 
achieve and do better than me. If 
they are uneducated, they could 
take a job picking grapes for $3 an 
hour. [f that's better than they 
made in their homeland, it must 
also be their right to provide a 
better life for their family. 

[ ceminly don't feel like pick-
ing grapes [ don't even like eating 
them. 

article, I was amused to say the 
least. The anicle itself was well 
written and presented, but it 
reminded me of grade school 
analysis - all opinion and no fact . 

Please do not misunderstand 
me. [ firmly believe that people are 
entitled to any opinions they 
choose. All too often, however, 
there are those who make state-
ments and have opinions that are 
totally ungrounded and frequent-
ly contrary to reality. They are 
more than welcome to ~ express 
their opinions but at the cost of 
sounding ignorant and stupid. [ 
would encourage the l\uthor to 
research his argument further, 
possibly with a more objective 
outlook. He might find that his 
opinion and the factual evidence 
are in conflict.

Colombia Agrees to Tum Over Territory to Rebel GroUp 

Euro:·- • 
Curremy plunged more 
than 2 percmt Tuesday 

Hoping to advance peace talks 
aimed at ending 3S years of fight-
ing, the government of Colombia 
has agreed to withdraw its troops 
from a remote but strategically sit-
uated northern region and turn 
the area into a safe haven for the 
country's second-largest guerrilla 
group. 

In a speech in Bogota on 
Tuesday marking Colombia's 
Armed Forces Day, President 
Andres Pastrana did not specify 
the timing of either the military 
pullback, which is expected to 
Involve at least three battalions, or 
the formal negotiations. However, 
both he and leaders of the guerril-
la group involved, the National 
Liberation Army, or ELN, h~iled 
the agreement as an important 
breakthrough in resolving a con-
flict that has claimed more than 
35,000 lives in the past decade 

alone. 
"With this accord we seek to 

take serious steps toward the con-
struction of a solution to this con-
tlict by methods other than war: 
Nicolas Rodriguez, the ELN's top 
commander, said in a commu-
nique read to Colombian radio 
networks late Monday night. The 
group has long been demanding a 
sanctuary in which to hold a 
"national convention" that would 
pave the way for peace talks. 

The demilitarization agreement 
is the second that Pa~trana has 
reached with Marxist-Leninist 
guerrillas since taking office in 
August 1998. Later that year, with-
out obtaining a cease-fire or other 
concessions, he ceded control of 
an area larger than Connecticut, 
Massachusetts and Rhode Island 
combined to the Revolutionary 
Armed Forces of Colombia, the 

largest and most dangerous of the 
country's three leftist insurgen-
cies. 

With few if any limitations on 
its activities in the area, the FARC, 
as the larger group is known, 
quicldy converted its zone into a 
hugely profitable coca-growing 
and drug-processing center and 
stockpiled large amounts of 
weapons for its 15,000 troops. It 
has also driven elected officials, 
judges and priests from the area, 
whose embittered residents now 
refer to it as "Farclandia: and 
forcibly recruited 10caJ youngsters 
into its ranks. 

Pastrana's action angered both 
ordinary Colombians and the 
ELN, which felt it was being 
slighted. In the past year, the 
group has responded with a wave 
of kidnappings. including the 
abductions of passengers on a 

commercial airplane flight and 
160 parishioners attending a 
Roman Catholic Mass. It also 
attacked highway traffic and elec-
tric power stations and pylons. 

The new agreement with the 
ELN, which has less than 5,000 
combatants, contains many 
restrictions on their activities that 
were not contained in the earlier 
accord with the larger group, 
reflecting the ELN's weaker mili-
tary position and bargaining 
power. 

ELN leaders have apparently 
agreed, for instance, not to step up 
military activities elsewhere in the 
country or to impose their own 
government in the new demilita-
rized zone.

Tehran Students Protest Crackdowns Against Press 

But the curo's drop on Tuesday

low the currency can go. It scttIed in 
New York at 92.08 American cents, 
down from 93.98 cents late Monday 
and $1 .0062 at the end of 1999. The 
average value this year is now 98 
cents - below the psychologically 
important level of $1, or parity. TEHRAN, Iran - With the 

reformers they supported under 
siege by conservabve judges and 
clerics, students at two Tehran 
universities held demonstrations 
Tuesday to denounce the widen-
ing crackdown on the nation's 
independent press. 

As the students protested, a 
judge in the capital closed another 
liberal newspaper - the13th to 
fall silent on orders from hard-line 
judges in just two days. In addi-
tion, anothe.r court issued an 
arrest warrant for a popular mod-

crate cleric who was accused of 
insulting Islam because he attend-
ed a recent conference in Berlin 
on democracy. 

Several reform-minded clerics 
are already in prison, convicted on 
similar charges, based on their 
open questioning of the Iranian 
religious establishment's political 
power. 

With unease mounting here in 
the capital, the student rallies were

reform leaders. They have repeat-
edly warned their supporters to.

The only bright spot for the 
euro now is that its decline this 
year is a little less than the 9.2 per-
cent fall in the comparable period 
last year. Investors have long said 
that the funher the euro falls, the 
more likely it can have a good rally 
- eventually. Those arc pretty 
weak positives for a currency that 
was once seen as challenger to the 
dollar for global supremacy.

Gore Calls for Elimination of Debt by 2013 
NEW YORK - Laying out his 

economic vision more fully than 
ever, Vice PrcsXicnt AI Gore offered 
himself on Tuesday as a fiscal con-
servative and steward of the 
Clinton administration', economic 
formula and prosperity. 

His primary goal, he said, was 
to reduce the national debt year 
by year, barring an emergency, 
and to set it on a course for com-
plete elimination by the year 
2013. 

He pledged to use the Social 
Security surplus and savings in 
debt payments to shore up the 
retirement program. He also pro-
moted tax cuts to help parents save 
for college tuition, job retraining. 
health insurance and long-term 
care and, for businesses. research 
and development. 

His purpose, he said, was not 
only to maintain the nation's 
prosperity but to maintain con-

sumer confidence in the econo-
my. 

"Moving purposefully to a 
debt-free America will be one of 
the best ways to sustain and 
increase the confidence that is the 
foundation of our present and 
future prosperity," Gore told more 
than 1,000 business, labor and 
civic leaders who arc members of 
the Association for a Better New 
York, at the Hilton Hotel in mid-
town Manhattan on Tuesday 
morning. 

"We have to make America 
debt-free before the baby boomers 
retire, so we can pay our obliga-
tions to them in the form of Social 
Security and Medicare," he said, 
crystallizing a central tenet of his 
candidacy. 

And although John J. Sweeney, 
president of the AFL-CIO, was in 
the audience, Gore also pledged an 
"aggressive" fight to open new 

world markets, like China, to pr0-
mote free trade. 

Gore sounded familiar themes 
of the Clinton formula, though in 
these days of a wildly ftuctuating 
stock market, he has abandoned 
his oft-repeated assertion that "wc 
know what works." 

Gore developed his economic 
strategy with Clinton's top ec0-
nomic advisers - Lawrence 
Summers, the 1rcasury secretary; 
Robert Rubin, the former secre-
~; and Gene Sperling. chief of 
Clmton's economic council. 

As a result. the Gore vision 
deliberately mirrors the Clinton 
approach of the last seven years, a 
period that extended a slow 
recovery into the longest eco-
nomic expansion in the nation's 
history.

Juvenile System Harsh With Minorities 
Black and Hispanic youths are 

treated more severely than white 
teen-a$ers charged with compara-
ble crimes at every step of the 
juvenile justice systen:t, according 
to a comprehenSive report 
released Thesday that was spon-
sored by the Justice Department 
and six of the nation's leading 
foundations. 

The report found ~at minority 
youths are more likely than their 
white counterparts to be arrested, 
held in jail, sent to juvenile or adult 
court for trial, convicted and given 
longer prison terms. 

Among young people who 
have not been sent to a juvenile 
prison before, blacks are more 
than six times as likely as whites 
to be sentenced by juvenile courts 
to prison. 

For those "young people 
charged with a violent crime who 
hue not been in juvenile prilOn 
previously, black teen--Frs are 
ninc times mora likely &han 

whites to be sentenced to juvenile 
prison. For those charged with 
drug offenses, black youths ar.e 
48 times more likely than whites 
to be sentenced to juvenile 
prison. 

Similarly, white youths charged 
with violent offenses are incarcer-
ated for an average on 93 days. but 
blacks are incarcerated an average 
of 254 days and Hispanics are 
incarcerated an average of 305 
days. 

"These disparities accumulate, 
and they make it hard for mem-
bers of the minority community 
to complete their education, get 
jobs and be good hits bands and 
fathers: said Mark Soler, the 
leader of tht coalition of civil 
rights and youth advocacy organi-
zations that organized the 
research project. The report, "And 
Justice for Some: docs not 
address why such sharp racial 
imbalances exist. But Soler lua-
psted that the cause lay not to 

much in overt discrimination as 
in "the stereotypes that the deci-
sion makers at each point of the 
system rely on." A judge may be 
influenced by the defendant's 
baggy jeans or the fact that he 
docs not have a father, Soler said. 

In the past, when studies have 
found racial disparities in the num-
ber of adult black or Hispanic 
prison inmates, critics have assert-
ed that the cause was simply that 
members of minorities committed 
a disproponionate number of 
crimes. 

That may be true, Soler said, 
but it docs not account for the 
extreme disparities found in the 
report, nor for disparities at each 
stage of the juvenile justice 

~s. 
"When you look at this data, it 

il undeniable that race is a factor:

society has failed to create role

that the vast majority of role mod-

Olmos went on to point out the 
importance of people understand-

Sushi is an edible masterpiece of i 

Sushi is the perfect food; it is the highest form of an manifested. The sou nd of wooden chopsticks 
(hash i) tapping ceramic plates mingles with the 
smell of pickled ginger (gari) and soy sauce. 
Watching the chef slicing and placing perfect 

~uts of ~sh adds depth to the feeling of the del-
~ cate, bite-Size morsels of nigiri-zushi melting 
In your mouth. The taste - lightly sweet, tangy, 
almost buttery and yet a bit spicy - is one that 
no other food , at least in the American palette, 
comes close to. 

There are not many an forms that you see, 
hear, smell, touch and taste - sushi engages all 
of the senses in its delicate culinary grasp, and 
the craving is catching on. 

For those who don't know, sushi is a time-
honored component of Japanese cuisine. 
Despite popular misconceptions, sushi does 
not mean raw fish , but instead describes the 
combination of vinigared rice and other ingre-
dients. Sashimi is the term for raw unadorned 
fish, and this, for the more adventurous, is also 
served at sushi bars. 

Nigiri-zushi is the most common form of 
sushi served in the states and consists of pieces 
o.f raw fish or cooked egg placed over vinigared 
nce balls (a style developed in Tokyo). 

Maki-zushC which refers to sushi rolls 
w~apl?ed i~ seaweed,. is also very popular. 
Nlgm-zushl and sashlmi are appreciated for 
their delicate balance of natural flavors, where-
as maki-z~shi (or sushi rolls) get a little bit 
more creative and have as many different fla-
vors and names as mixed drinks. 

Aside from the infamous California rolls. 
certain restaurants offer such choices as "Mark 
McGwire" rolls and other fashionable titles. 
Many of these nontraditional rolls are made 
with heavier ingredients, such as cream cheese, 
to emulate the heavier American diet. Simpler 
rolls, like the cucumber roll , are popular in 
Japan . 

There are a few things that are essential to 
the sushi experience. Pieces of sushi are never 
served separately because the Japanese words

liliiii: Managtr and head sushi chef. ltenjamin Chen, roles ingredients into a sheet of nort seaweed at 
restaurant Tadashi in La]olJa. His lJJOIi is visible to tutryone sitting around him a/ the sushi bar. 

Sushi: 
Great sushi can be found at 
affordable prices in San Diego 
Ccallu .11 ".. ..... 11 
for ·single cut" and • kill " and ·suicide" are 
very similar. Almost always, pieces of sushi 
are served in pairs. 

Often, in more traditional restaurants, 
customers are handed a hot towel to clean 
their hands with before and after their meal. 
In addition to chopsticks and the small 
ceramic saucer for soy sauce, sushi is served 
with a side of pickled light-pink ginger and 
a ball of bright green wasabi, or Japanese 
horseradish. Patrons should go lightly on 
the latter unless they want their eyes to 
water and their faces to burn with internal 
pain. 

Wasabi aside, sushi is a much more 
approachable meal than many people 
realize, There are many rolls for vegetari-
ans, especially in California, that leave out 
the fish. For those who are irreversibly 
afraid of raw fish, there are a few types of 
nigiri-zushi, such as unagi (grilled eel), 
tamago (sweet egg custard) and ebi 
(boiled shrimp) that eliminate cooking 
concerns. 

For the adventurous, the possibilities are 
endless. Aside from the basics such as sake 
(salmonl or maguro (tuna), there are such 
choices as ika (squid), toro (choice tuna 
belly) or uni (sea urchin roe). An order of 
edamame (boiled soybeans that are lightly 
salted) and miso soup are great additions to 
a sushi meal. Of course, a mug of warm 
sake (not salmon, but a fermented rice 
drink) is a nice twist on the alcoholic dinner 
beverage. 

By the way, unagi - one of my personal 
favorite selections mentioned above - is 
traditionally thought to be stamina-giving. It 
is grilled over hot charcoals, steamed to 
remove excess fat, seasoned with a sweet 
sauce and then grilled again to make it crisp 
on the outside and tender on the inside. [t is 
eaten during one of the hottest days of the 
year to provide strength and vitality for the 
rest of the year. 

Aside from strange fish parts, the other 
main factor that causes a lot of people to shy 
away from sushi is the price. [n some ways, 
the high price of sushi also raises its value of 
appreciation, If patrons spend $40 on a 
meal, they arc: going to be: sure to savor and 
enjoy it - sushi is the antithesis to McDon-
ald's food. 

There are many atTordable sushi bars in 
San Diego, however, and they are typically 
packed with people every night. For high 
quality, Sushi Ota in Pacific Beach and 

Nobu in Solana Beach are hard to beat, and 
for good prices (and good quality) Sushi 
Deli in downtown and Yummy Maki 
Yummy Box, next to Domino's pizza by 
UCSD, are popular. 

There are enough different sushi joints 
around San Diego to keep hungry students 
busy every night of the week. Anyone who 
has walked down Gamet Avenue in Pacific 
Beach or driven downtown can testify to the 
fact that there seems to be a sushi restaurant 
on every other block. 

Ultimately, everyone should figure out 
what they like for themselves because every 
sushi place has its own unique flair - but 
the best indication of sushi bar quality and 
atTordability is probably how noisy and 
crowded the restaurant is. 

Surprisingly, one of the most reasonably 
priced sushi bars in San Diego can be found 
in La Jolla. Tadashi,locateCl at 1277 Prospect 
Place, otTers delicious sushi cuisine within 
the average student's budget. Regularly, the 
prices arc: somewhat steep, but the restau-
rant otTers a special every day of the week, 
consisting of all-you-can-eat sushi (while 
sitting at the sushi bar) for $16 at lunch and 
$20 at dinner. 

Todashi's sushi bar special is amazing 
considering it is quite easy to gobble down 
$40 of yummy sushi and still be ready for 
more. The manager and head sushi chef of 
Tadashi, Benjamin Chen, said there is an art 
to making sushi. 

·Sushi chefs are constantly learning 
how to improve themselves: Chen said. 
·Some people haye a very good back-
ground, like their grandfather happened to 
be a master chef, so they have very good 
skills because they were brought up that 
way. Many people learn on the job. They 
start with cleaning and cutting and learn 
discipline before they are allowed to 
become a chef." 

Chen was taught on the job and worked 
his way up to head sushi chef. He consid-
ers sushi an art, but recognizes that there 
are others who are more experienced, and 
still others who do not care about presen-
tation at all. With the popularity of the all-
you-can-eat sushi bar, it is hard for him to 
find time to be too creative, but the beau-
ty of the consideration and skill is still 
there. 

Some of the components of judging 
sushi include whether the rk~ is tight 
enough to hold a shape but loose enough to 
melt in the mouth, whether all the cut 
pieces of rolled sushi are the same height, 
whether every cross-section looks exactly 
the same and whether the cuts are free of 
rice smudges.

the fried shrimp heads, and salmon skin hand roll is enough to make mouths water. 

Sushi: 
Heaa sushi chef talks 
about his view of the art 

Chen also discussed some of 
the safety issues surrounding sushi 
that scare away some newcomers. 

"When you cut up fish you 
have to be aware of where a worm 
may be, but people get sick from 
eating chicken; people die from 
eating hamburgers," Chen said. 
·You have to be: cautious with 
everything. A lot of fish is frozen, 
which increases safety after it's 
caught, and this doesn't affect the 
taste of the fish: 

Tadashi is a good example ofthe 
adaptation of Japanese cuisine in 
America. 

First of all, the idea of "all-you-
can-eat" is about as American as 
you can get. Sushi and bountiful 

eating are two of the best ideas to 
come together from separate pans 
of the world. Secondly, a few 
of the chefs working under Chen 
at Tadashi are Hispanic, and Chen 
is a Chinese name. This reflects the 
fact that sushi is becoming a per-
manent pan of American culture 
- it has become so popular 
because it is able to adapt to the 
specific cul tures of where it is 
made. 

"People in Japan know about 
California rolls because they have 
been around for about 25 years, 
but you still can't get them in 
Japan: Chen explained . "When 
Japanese people come here, they try 
' it - they want to know what it 
tastes lile. In Mexico, they have 
sushi that is Mexicanized. They 
have different flavors that taste 
good according to them. Sushi is 
interchangeable; you can create 
your own. These days. it is interna-
tional:

Ending Affirmative 
Action Was Bad. Enough 

The university system that is already too well known for ending affrrmative action is at 
it again. 

Discrimination and sexual harassment are serious and pervasive problems at the University 
of California. Now UC is trying to deny unionized employees ~he right to have contractual 
protections against these problems. 

In bargaining for first contracts with the 10,000 academic student employees represented 
by the UAWand the 18,000 clerical employees represented by the Coalition of University 
Employees (CUE), UC bargainers are insisting that third party arbitration rights for 
discrimination be denied, except in extreme cases where supervisors discipline or fire 
harassed employees. Rather than deal with workplace issues in a union workplace context, 
the university seeks to force workers to seek lengthy and expensive remedies from 
government agencies and courts. 

In other words, the. university is opposed to a contractual requirement that a fair and 
impartial third party decide whether an employee has been discriminated against or 
harassed. 

That's depite the fact that such protection is standard in most union contracts, including 
those at other universities. 

Neutral arbitration is important because university employees who do not enjoy access 
to tenure and other protections afforded to professors and administrators are especially 
vulnerable to discrimination and harassing behavior. Such behavior is even sometimes 
justified in the university setting as a permissable consequence of II management rights" 
or "academic judgement." 
The university'S intransigence on this issue, together with other unreasonable contract 
proposals, is preventing agreement on contracts which would be good for all of the 
stakeholders in the UC system. 

It's time for UC to be a model of fair employment practices, where acts of discrimination 
and sexual hara'ssment can be challenged by strong contractual rights.

team ran out of time as the clock 
expired and the game ended in a 9-8 
Aztec victory. This loss came despite 
the intrepid play of many UCSD 
players who dug deep to try to knock 
off the much-hated SDSU team. 

Katal Carello and Hilary Smith 
had two goals apiece, while]ennifer 
Sheveland, Linda Monroe, Samara 
Silverman and Courtney Hemmerly 
all scored once in the tough loss. 

This loss placed the women's

respect for our crew team.) 

We turned the boat back toward 
the shore and beached it at a clear 
area away from the rocks and the 
pissed-off fisherman. 

We sat there contemplating our , 
fate. We could have walked back, 
which would have been much 
longer than the direct water route 
we had taken. We could have 
flagged down someone to have 
them give us a ride, or we could 
have sat there and waited until 
someone in charge came by and 
offered us assistance. 

Luckily, we did not need either.

but the Thitons still put in a solid 
effort, doubling up on Cal Baptist 
8-4 to grab seventh place. 

The. 1Iitons- W(re led by the \.. 
strong play of Smith, who netted 
three goals and the two-goal per-
formance of Kudritzki. Silverman, 
Welsh and Danielle Boyle also had 
single goals in the match. 

The Tritons' seventh-place 
showing in the tournament ended 
their season - they missed out on 
the at-large nationals spot. 

The Thitons' efforts were not 
entirely disappointing in the tour-
nament, however. The young team, 
comprised almost entirely of 
underclassmen, showed a lot of 
heart and improvement over the 
weekend. The Tritons' overall play 
during the season's final stretch 
was a far cry from their early-sea-
son tribulations, which bodes well 
for the future of the women's water 
polo program at UCSD. 

Judy's four-year-old sister. They 
proceeded to hit the rocks and float 
by where the guy's fishing lines had 
been. Their motor wasn't running 
very well either. 

My fiance 's family eventually 
slowly towed us and as we 
approached the dod , the guy in 
charge told us to stop and drop 
anchor. 

So there we were, sitting on the 
~ke w.ith everyone looking at us. My 
slster-tn-Iaw even took a picture of 
ow' problems from the shore. 

It happens to be that the prob-
lem with the boat was a simple one, 
needing only a small pin replaced. 
A guy came by and helped us, and 
we were on our way. 

After returning to the dock and 
dry land, we were laughed at by our 
families. 

When it was my brother's tum 
to use the boat he and his wife 
stalled, too. Twice.

finishes in their events. 
The Triton men ran to victory 

in the 4xl00 meter relay to extend 
their point leads. Matt Meskimen 
took first in the javelin as did Matt 
Deford in the hammer. As if 
crushing school records in the 
running events wasn't enough, 
Freeman also tossed the javelin 
far enough to grab a second-place 
finish. 

"We have a tremendous men's 
team and the women's side is even 
better: Salerno said. "They're 20-
1, mostly against Division I and II 
schools. We have a very good dual 
meet record on both sides." 

The great performances from 
both sides of the track and field 
team last weekend should continue 
this weekend as the team ventures 
to Berkeley for the important 
California! evada State 
Championships. 

Gunther emphasized the 
importance of focusing on the 
National Championship: 
"Nationals! Nationals! Nationals! 
It's all about Nationals!" she said. 

LaPlante has clear goals for the 
remainder of thl: team's season. 

"Ideally, we will be among the 
top two teams to make it to nation-
als,· LaPlante said. "Trinity will 
probably defeat whenever lit 
plays], so it is up to us to take care 
of business and get ourselves a 
birth into the National 
Championship. We need to rev it 
up a notch for the upcoming tour-
nament. We will be working hard 
for regionals with extra condition-
ing and more scrimmaging. We 
should be ready." 

eighth, the Triton5 were down 
seven runs. Things were looking 
dire, but they scored three runs on 
three singles and an error. 

In the bottom of the ninth the 
team got three more to pull with-
in one. With runners on the cor-
ners and two outs, Brian Terrell 
had a chance to tie or win the 
game, but fouled out into the 
catcher's mitt. 

"We have to get back to funda-
mental baseball," O'Brien said. 
"We're a good ball club if we get 
back to fundamentals." 

This weekend the Tritons travel 
to Orange, Calif. to play Claremont 
and then they begin the Triton 
Classic on the sixth of May.

Southern Cal Competition 
Pales to UCSD Might 
Triton track puts the smack-dawn an Cal State Bakersfield, UC 
Riverside and Cal State L.A. as men and women dominate 
.,sccm_ 
Staff Writer 

When it was all over, the other teams 
could only stand around wheezing and star-
ing pathetically at their feet. 

The UCSD track and field team pulled 
off a clean sweep with both the men's and 
women's sides spanking all other competi-
tion that dared to compete at the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association dual meets. 

'We thoroughly dominated,· 
said Head Coach Tony 
Salerno. ·We expected a little 
bit more competi tion. I 
believe that they felt they did-
n't have a chance against us. They 
basically rolled over for us." 

The competition, held last weekend 
at Cal State Los Angeles, was all Thton from 
start to finish. 

The toughest challenge came courtesy of 
UC Riverside, which managed to lose 97-81 
on the men's side. The UCSD men 
destroyed host Cal State Los Angeles 99-66 
in their ot~er matchup. 

The women's side saw three absolute 
obliterations - the Thtons trounced Cal 
State University Los Angeles 111-50, 
Sonoma State 114-62 and UC Riverside 
126-23. 

The biggest story of the day was the per-
formance of senior speedster Jim Freeman, 
who took first place in 110 hurdles with a 
scorching time of 14.08 seconds. This time 
was fast enough to etch Freeman's name 
into the UCSD record book as the fastest in 
this event, and it was also the top mark in 
the nation in NCAA Division ((( track and 
fleld this season. 

UCSD senior Nicole Rodriguez also 
turned in a stellar performance. winning the 
4OO-meter intermediate hurdles in 64.42 

seconds, qualifyinB her for the NCAA 
Division m Championships. 

Jessica Shugart, another UCSD senior, 
had a huge day on the track, turning in 
four fi rst-place performances. Not only 
d id Shugart anchor the first-place finish-
ing 4 xloo relay squads, but she also man-
aged to find the energy to take home the 
gold in the 100- and 200-meter dashes. 

Her blazing time of 25 .21 in the 
200 qualifies her for NCAA cham-
pionships. 

UCSD's convincing team vic-
tories were aided by the per-
forma nces of many other 
1riton athletes who showed 
up ready to run on Saturday. 
In the women's 100 meter, 

Laura Marttila was slower only than 
her Triton teammate. finishing a 

respectable second. Mantila later added a 
third-place finish in the 200 meter. 

Danielle Scheibli chipped in with a sec-
ond-place showing in the 100 meter high 
hurdles; Clara Wilson did the same in the 
400 meter intermediates for UCSD. 

Carolyn Jones emerged victorious in the 
3000 meter, while further Thton victories 
went down in the 400 meter and the 1500 
meter thanks to the efforts of Allison 
McGrane and Maggie Dwire. respectively. 

Amie Wu finished second to Dwire in the 
1500 meter to rack up additional points and 
Erin Sclim contributed a second-place fin -
ish in the 800 meter. 

The Triton women throwers swept 
three out of the four throwing events of 
the day. 

Megan Steel had the longest toss in the 
shot put and discus competitions to grab 
fIrSts. Steel managed only second place in 
hammer-heaving action, beat out by UCSD

Baseball Squad has a Case of the 
Skids as Triton's Lose Three More 
Record falls to 18-11 with two losses to Cal State Hayward, 
one to Claremont after starting the season a stellar 14-4 
., TAlI' IIILLIII 
Staff Writer 

T he baseball gods have thrown some 
bad juju on the 1ritons - they continue 
to struggle to find a way to win. The week-
end started well as UCSD defeated CSU 
Hayward 5-4 in the first game of a dou-
bleheader. Then they dropped three 
straight, two to the Hayward 
Pioneers and one to Claremont 
College. 

The high point of the week-
end trip was Triton starting 
pitcher Alex Cremidan who 
was smoking last Friday 
when he limited the Pioneers 
to four unearned runs in seven 
innings pitched. He also recorded 
11 strikeouts, his first game with 
double-digit strikeout numbers this sea-
son. 

The top of the lineup produced for 
Cremidan - the 1-4 hitters went a com-
bined 4-12 and scored four of the Tritons' 
five runs. Chad Addison drove in two runs 
while lYler Addison picked up his 32nd 
RBI. 

Three of the Triton runs were unearned. 
UCSD took advantage of some lazy defense 
by the Pioneers and five walks by Hayward 
starting pitcher Nick Bums. It was smart 

. baseball, the Thtons were playing for the 
run and not for the kill. 

This game was only scheduled for 
seven innings and Cremidan got credit for 
the complete game and the win and Burns 
was tagged with the loss. 

The second game of the doubleheader 
was a pitchers' duel. Unfortunately for 
UCSD, Jon Stewart had complete command 
of his repertoire and pitched a complete 
game. limiting the Tritons to a meager four 
hits and a paltry zero runs. He recorded 11 

strikeouts and issued only one walk, Pedro 
Martinez-like numbers 

Andy Holloway was no slouch for 
UCSD. Pitching six strong innings, he 
allowed three runs, two of them earned. He 
struck out eight Hayward batsmen and had 
only one base on balls. 

It was the top half of the Hayward lineup 
that did most of the damage - the batters 
went a combined 8-19 and drove in all four 

Pioneer runs. 
The Tritons spent the night at 

Hayward and played again the 
next morning at 11 a.m. - their 
third game in less than 24 
hours. The two games and the 
long bus ride to Hayward 

seemed to have taken a little bit 
out of UCSD's sails. 
Hayward jumped out to an early 

2-0 lead in the boltom of the first and 
never looked back as it scored in every 
inning and recorded 14 hits. The Tritons 
tried to make it close, cutting the lead to 6-
5 in the top half of the fifth on a sac fly, a 
wild pitch and an error by the Hayward 
shortstop. 

AJas, the Pioneers would have none of it, 
and immediately quelched the threat by 
scoring two runs in the bottom half of the 
fifth, four in the sixth and three more in the 
final two innings. 

The final score was 15-5 Hayward. 
The Tritons' next game was yesterday 

at home against Claremont College. In 
what can only be good news for the 
Tritons, John Beaven made his first start 
since the end of March. He was a little 
rusty at first, giving up four runs in his 
first inning of work. In the second inning 
he settled down and retired the side in 
order.

Boat Tribulations at 
Lake Cuyamaca 

This Easter weekend, my family 
and my fiance's family got together 
for a relaxing picnic a~ Lake 
Cuyamaca. 

There, we did a number of 
activities such as playing games 
and having an egg hunt. A huge 
lunch that included ham sand-
wiches, carne asada, salads and 
other edible goodies was accompa-

ni~d by soda and beer and was 
topped off with Easter candy and 
cake. 

Oh, and there was the lake. 
Lake Cuyamaca is a beautiful 

lake surrounded by mountains and 
trees, nestled just east of here. In 
addition to fIShing, boating is one 
of the more popular activities at the 
lake. 

The sailor in me started to rum-
ble, and I had an urge to venture 
onto the sea in a small boat. 
Unfortunately, the Gilligan in me 
took over. 

There are three nautical options 
at Lake Cuyamaca: paddle boat, 
row boat and motor boat. Paddle 
boat was never my scene and the 
row boat ... well, I remember being 
stuck with my dad and brother on 
the middle of Lake Cuyamaca in a 
row boat that was going nowhere 
fast when I was six, which was the 
last time I was there. I didn't want 
to do that again. 

Also, my bro told me a story of a 
friend of hIS who once rented a row 
boat and became so frustrated he 
eventually abandoned it in the 
woods. So, despite costing $10 ' 
more, my brother and I chipped in 
to split a motor boat. 

The vehicle is fairly simple: Pull 
the cord and the engine starts. twist 
a handle to accelerate and rotate 
the rudder to go different direc-
tions. 

With this knowledge under my 
hat, my lovely fiance Judy and I 
headed to the open water for our 
first motor boat experience. 

As captain of my ship, I was 
cruising around the lake with Judy 
by my side, enjoying the air and the 
sights and the calmness of being on 
the water, one with nature. 

We circled the water, and upon 
reaching the point farthest from 
where we started, I cut the motor to 
relax. 

Well , I neglected to drop 
anchor. 

The next thing I knew, we were 
floating toward some rocks on the 
shore. 

Knocking against the rocks 
wasn't enough. On the shore was a 
guy fishing with three or four lines. 
Needless to say, as our boat entan-
gled itself in his lines, he was not 
too happy. 

Once we got out of our new 
friend 's lines and were headed in 
the right direction, I started the 
motor again. 

That was a mistake. 
We were not yet clear of the 

rocks and the motor spurted out 
smoke and died on us. I went pale. 

Thinking about how much a lit-
tle motor boat may cost me, I pro-
ceeded to set up the oars and began 
my own regatta to the dock. 

My inexperience at rowing and 
the steady breeze blowing against 
us allowed us to move all of two 
feet. (I now have much greater

Women's Tennis Team Finishes 
Season With a Pair of Victories 
UCSD improves record to 17-2 with wins over Claremont, Point Lorna 

Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's tennis team finished its 
regular season on a high note, defeating 
Claremont College on April 13 and neighbor 
Point Loma Nazarene University on April 25 . 

These two victories increased the team's 
overall record to 17 wins with just two 
losses, giving UCSD a top seed in the 
upcoming regional tournament. 

The match against 
Claremont College proved the 
dominance the athletes have in 
singles. They took five of the six 
singles matches with solid per-
formances from No. 1 Amy Tranckino 
and No. 3 Yen Yen Ho. 

"There were a lot of close matches in the 
Claremont match: said Head Coach Liz 
laPlante. "The doubles scores especially were too 
close for comfort, but the girls dug them out and 
came through. The singles portion went well . 
Kristen lost a tough three-setter to the No. 2 play-
er from Claremont, but she made it a match with 
a good second-set win. Overall, the team played 
well in all aspects." 

Thton Rachel Gunther also commended the 
great play of the singles matches. 

"We dominated the singles matches, winning 
five of six: Gunther said. "We will likely face 
Claremont again in the regionals, so it is impor-
tant to keep up the same intensity. I think we will 

do it." 
The team from Point Loma Nazarene seemed 

to be no trouble for UCSD. 
The two schools had already faced each other 

before and UCSD knew what to expect. During 
the teams' earlier season meeting. the Thtons 
won 7-2, dropping only the first two singles 
matches. On Thesday, not much changed as the 
team bettered its effort with an 8-1 romp. 

"Point Loma Nazarene was a good prac-
tice match for the girls,· LaPlante said. 
"[Point Lorna's) No.1 player is excep-

tionally good, so it gave us a 
vision of what we will see at 
regionals and hopefully at 
nationals. Again, overall we 

played well at the singles portion and 
consistent at the doubles portion." 
At the upcoming regional competition, 

there will be five teams in this region that will play 
for a spot at nationals. This region includes teams 
such as Trinity College and Pomona College. Out 
of the five teams, the top two will be fortunate 
enough to go to nationals. 

UCSD has locked in the No. 2 seed, and 
Trinity top the top seed in the region. If the 
favorites go on and win, UCSD and Thnity 
College will make it to the National 
Championship bracket. 

The third- and fourth-seeded teams will play 
on a Saturday and UCSO will face the winner on

Not A Splash 
forWater 
Polo Squad 
Women's team places a 
disappointing Seventh at 
Southern Cal Regionals 
., seem IUIIIIOUGIII 
Staff Writer 

It was a difficult weekend for the 
UCSD women's water polo squad as it 
ventured north to the University of 
Southern California. 

Perhaps it was the lack of sea 
breeze that caused the Tritons to end 
up in seventh place in the 2000 
Women's Water Polo Southern 
California Regionals held in LA this 
weekend. They had hoped for a big 
showing in the regional tournament, 
but the team faltered and fell to lesser 
competitton that it had beaten easily 
in the past. 

The tournament started off on a 
dour note for the Tritons. RighI off the 
bat, they were beaten by cross-town 
rival San Diego State. They had played 
strongly against the Aztecs before, but 
could not catch a break in this match 
and eventually fell 5-2. 

The two Triton goals. which came 
courtesy of Emma Kudritzki and Kari 
Lyman, simply were not enough to 
topple the State team, which was led 
by all-tournament team selection 
Larisa Baltgalvis. 

SDSU gOI off to a 4-1 first-half 
lead and never looked back. 

The second match-up was the real 
heartbreaker for the Tritons. They lost 
in overtime 6-5 to a Loyola Maramount 
University team that they had handily 
vanquished in past meetings. 

It was all defmse early on - LMU 
had scored the only goal heading into 
halftime. UCSD then bounced back in 
the third quarter to knot the score at 
2-2 and both schools caged a pair in 
the fourth, ending re$ulation with the 
score deadlocked at SIX apiece. 

LMU unfortunately had the extra 
energy needed to put in two goals to 
the Thtons, one of which was in the 
overtime frame to take the victory. Five 
different Thton players tallied goals in 
this match, which Head Coach Larry 
Sanders called a tough pill to swallow. 

"We definitely had the opportuni-
ties, being up 4-2 at one point: 
Sanders said. "They battled us and 
hopefully we learned something from 
the tournament." 

With the loss, the Thtons were 
once again slated to fac~ SDSU; they 
vowed to seek retribution for their 
uninspired loss in the earlier match. 

Their play was much stronger in 
this match, but they still were edged by 
the Aztecs 9-8. A huge first quarter 
saw nine goals scored between the 
teams, and the first half ended with the 
Aztecs leading 7-6. The ddenses of 
both teams settled in the second half 
and both teams scrambled for goal-
scoring opportunities. 

The Thtons surged late in the game. 
putting away two fourth-quarter goals 
in an attempt to force overtime. The
