The UCSD Athletics Department 
announced the creation of its first 
ever Athletics Hall of Fame last 
Monday. The Hall will recognize 
the department’s finest student ath-
letes, coaches, staff and those who 
have supported the creation of an 
Athletics Hall of Fame.

“UC San Diego is still a relatively 
young institution from an athletic 
perspective, but given the tremen-
dous success we’ve had, creating a 
Hall of Fame that would recognize 
some of those significant accom-
plishments and the individuals who 
have meant so much to our his-
tory seemed like a natural,” Senior 
Associate Athletics Director Ken 
Grosse said to the Guardian. “We’ve 
been talking about it internally for 
several years, but the timing seems 
right, and we’re excited about being 
able to engage with our alumni ath-
letes through this forum.”

Honorees of the Hall of Fame 
have not yet been decided and will 
depend on a nomination process. 
The nominations will be held for an 
eight-person inaugural class and will 
be opened to the public.

Nominations will take place over 
the next few weeks. The Athletics 
Department will add the nominees 
to other names they have already 
recognized as potential candidates.

The committee will consist of 
Director of Athletics Earl Edwards 
and Senior Associate Athletic 
Directors Ken Grosse and Wendy 
Taylor May. Other committee mem-
bers include representatives from 
the UCSD coaching stage and stu-
dent athlete alumni. The committee 
is responsible for narrowing down 
the list to eight honorees.

ATHLETICS

BY  sarah  m oon  senior  staff  writer

Plaza Cafe, the Revelle College din-
ing hall, is closing for an upgrade 
beginning Saturday, June 15. 
According to Housing, Dining and 

Hospitality  Committee member and 
former Revelle HDH Representative 
Simran Anand, the dining hall is one 
of UCSD’s largest dining halls and has 
the most expansive kitchen, but it does 
not currently generate enough revenue 
to continue business. 

HDH Services has plans to upgrade 
the kitchen by adding different food 
service areas and decorations within 
the current dining area. Renovations 
will include the installation of a 
smoothie or sushi bar. Plans have also 

been made to include a fireplace and 
install lights from the Cafe’s elevated 
ceiling to make the dining hall seem 
cozier.

Changes to the dining hall’s exte-
rior are also set to take place, with ren-
ovations to door locations including 
the creation of new entrances between 
Blake and Argo Hall —a space which 
currently acts as an emergency exit.

Roger’s Place, the Revelle Market, 
will also undergo construction; there 
are plans to switch its location with 

Revelle College’s conference rooms, 
although it will continue to serve stu-
dents at its current site during the 
transition. 

Plaza Cafe is set to reopen after one 
year, following upgrades. 

“These upgrades will make Plaza 
more appealing and hopefully more 
sustainable as currently its cost is way 
too high,” Anand said. “Hopefully 
more students will be eating there, 
and it will lose its reputation as one of 
the least friendly and appealing dining 

halls on this campus.”
On Wednesday, June 5, HDH held 

a farewell gathering for the dining hall.  
The event included DJs, live music, 
vintage and new arcade games, menu 
specials and various treats. 

A survey will be sent out by Revelle 
administration asking for student 
input on renaming the Cafe during the 
next school year.

A Penny for Her Thoughts
The Guardian sits down with Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Penny Rue for an 
exit interview before she departs for her new position at Wake Forest University.

Following an announcement that Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Penny Rue will be leaving UCSD to begin her position as vice president of Student Life at Wake Forest University, the 
Guardian sat down with Dr. Rue for a final interview. 

Guardian: Good afternoon, Dr. Rue. First off, congratulations on a 
tenure of over five years as vice chancellor of Student Affairs.
Vice Chancellor Rue: Thank you very much.

G: Can you speak a little about the issues you had to address as vice 
chancellor?
R: I came in based on my conversations with the search committee 
and with Chancellor Maryanne Fox with a focus on three real priori-
ties. The first was strengthening the sense of community at UC San 
Diego, the second was paying greater attention to student safety and 
well being and the third was really increasing our appreciation of 
diversity — our ability to really respect and learn from each other and 
those who are different from ourselves. Each of those are pretty big 

items, so you don’t ever say “I completed that,” but I think we made 
quite a progress in each of those areas. 

G: Is there any specific strategic planning effort at the forefront for 
next year?
R: I think issues of campus climate are very, very important — we 
work[ed] pretty hard on those throughout my tenure, and it’s won-
derful now that with the new vice chancellor for Equity, Diversity and 
Inclusion, we’ve got another — again — set of partners working on 
that, so there are lots of different thrusts to improving campus climate. 
A lot of them have to do with creating communities of interests and 
real areas of support for underrepresented students. We now have 
our new Black Resource Center that just opened in the [Old Student 
Center] just last week, so I think that’s an exciting opportunity. 

G: Perhaps on the other side of the spectrum, what do you think 
has been your biggest accomplishment as vice chancellor of 
Student Affairs?

UCSD School of Medicine 
researchers identified a protein last 
week that regulates blood vessel 
growth through the removal of cho-
lesterol. The research was published 
online in the Nature journal under 
associate professor of medicine Dr. 
Yury Miller and first author Longhou 
Fang on May 29.

Research involved the study of 
zebrafish, during which researchers 
identified the apoA-I binding protein 
in the fish and did several experi-
ments to test the protein’s function.

“We tested AIBP in several pilot 
experiments and the one looking at 
angiogenesis, when new blood vessels 
sprout from the bigger ones and grow 
to form the blood circulatory system, 

was promising,” Miller said.
The researchers added DNA to 

inhibit AIBP synthesis in order to 
examine the angiogenesis — or for-
mation of new blood vessels — in 
the zebrafish as they watched the 
embryos grow under a fluorescent 
microscope.  Researchers noticed 
that the lack of AIBP caused excessive 
and chaotic blood vessel growth and 
proceeded to study the mechanisms 
behind their observations.

“The mechanism was linked to 
cholesterol, which is the major culprit 
of atherosclerosis, the disease that 
leads to heart attacks and stroke — a 
main direction of research in my 
lab so far,” Miller said. “We found 
that AIBP helps ensure an efficient 
cholesterol removal from endothelial 
cells. If this doesn’t happen, blood 

vessels overgrow and grow in wrong 
directions.”

In the future, the researchers 
intend to look at AIBP in cancer and 
cardiovascular systems after a heart 
attack, hoping to study the protein’s 
ability to cut off blood supply to can-
cerous tumors, which grow quickly 
and need new blood vessels for extra 
blood supply. Researchers will also 
investigate whether or not they can 
regulate AIBP after a heart attack in 
order to grow more blood vessels to 
supply the heart with more blood.

“These are big tasks and a lot of 
work [needs] to be done until we 
know if our findings will lead to new 
therapies,” Miller said.

The first group of honorees 
will we announced as part the 
department’s annual Homecoming 
Weekend events this coming 
October.

“This is an exciting time for 
us as it is another milestone for 
where we are as an athletics depart-
ment,” Edwards said in Monday’s 
announcement. “We have had a rela-
tively short but illustrious history, 
and the Hall of Fame will allow us to 
reflect on our past as well as provide 
another opportunity to engage and 

honor our alumni athletes.”
UCSD student athletes can be 

nominated for Hall of Fame induc-
tion 10 years after their eligibility to 
play for the university. In addition, 
coaches and staff may be considered 
after three years away from UCSD 
or 25 consecutive years of service.

Nomination forms are available 
online in electronic and mail-in form 
on the UCSD Tritons website. The 
forms ask for the nominee’s basic infor-
mation, graduation year, college and 
sport, as well as an area to describe 
post-graduate accomplishments and 
supporting nominee information. 

 “We’ve been fortunate to have 
had a phenomenally successful his-
tory, and any time you can honor 
the people who created that history, 
it helps enhance it even further,” 
Grosse said. “Additionally, having 
alumni athletes involved is the kind 
of thing that really separates the 
great intercollegiate athletic pro-
grams from merely good ones. In 
recognizing the past and building 
for the future, the Hall of Fame is a 
positive in every aspect.”

I know, I know, Aleks is not here, 
and it’s the last meeting of the year. It’s 
a travesty. Just bear with me.

Council seemed extra upbeat 
today, which was interesting because 
I was extra tired. I don’t want to make 
any supernatural conclusions yet, but 
there is a definite correlation.

I was also warned by UCAB chair 
Sammy Chang, who took a seat next 
to me, that I was in 
for a long meeting; 
unfortunately, he 
did not disappoint.

The meeting 
began with pub-
lic input that lasted for a solid hour, 
consisting almost entirely of concerns 
regarding appointments within the 
Office of External Affairs. 

Multiple speakers pointed directly 
to VP External Affairs Vanessa Garcia, 
questioning decisions made in hir-
ing the new legislative advisor — UC 
Student Association President Raquel 
Morales — and the two new Campus 
Organizing Directors.

Former Social Sciences Senator 
Emma Berdugo was especially 
angered at Garcia, coming prepared 
with over three pages of double-
spaced allegations and concerns.

“I’m really disappointed in the 
EVP’s position,” Berdugo said.

Public Input also included short 
presentations by SOVAC, which 
urged council to participate in voter 
outreach, the Swipes for the Homeless 
Program and a committee on the 
behalf of UCSD service workers.

Council then moved on to 
special presentations — four, to 
be exact — courtesy of Matthew 
Mayeda, Teach for America, 
Sammy Chang and former VP 
Finance Bryan Cassella.

Matthew “The Wise” Mayeda 
was the first to present, giving sage 
advice to A.S. Council, asking coun-

cilmembers to cherish their journey 
and create real change. Following his 
speech was a presentation by Teach 
for America, complete with a video 
montage of cute children.

I don’t think I’ve ever been so 
touched during a council meeting.

However, I didn’t appreciate the 
fact that I couldn’t partake in the 
free sunglasses that were handed out 

by the Teach for 
America folks. 

The same thing 
happened when 
Cassella brought 
doughnuts. 

Twice in a row? Come on.
Just when I thought council was 

wrapping up, Sammy Chang came 
up to present on the history of A.S. 
Council since 1961.

Like, the complete history. I saw 
minds melting — perhaps out of awe 
and perhaps out of boredom.

In addition, after tonight, I think 
Sammy may be inducted into the 
Guinness Book of World Records for 
the most use of the words “percent,” 
“finance” and “committee.” 

Former A.S. President Meggie Le 
went next to speak about transitions 
regarding transportation, the eternal 
hot-button issue.

According to Le, UCSD is the 
only UC campus that does not pay 
anything toward transportation, what-
soever.

Of course, that is slated to change 
due to Transportations Services’ enor-
mous deficit.

“TPS has been in the red for years,” 
Le said. “Expenditures have increased; 
revenue has stayed the same.”

Le also said that TPS may make 
changes during the summer — with-
out the disturbance of student input 
— and introduce the new policies in 
September.

That’s a little scary, I have to admit.

Council Discusses Finance, 
Transportation, and Donuts

R: There are two things I’m most 
proud of. The first: Four years ago, in 
collaboration with the campus com-
munity centers, we created some-
thing called the Institute for Building 
Communities for Social Justice, and 
for four years in the summer we ran a 
week-long institute for Student Affairs 
staff — about 25 to 30 people — who 
really delved into both the scholar-
ship around equity and diversity and 
[thought] about how that informed 
their personal and professional prac-
tice. So we’ve had over 100 people go 
through that institute, and I think it’s 
really enriched the community. It’s cre-
ated new collaborations, it’s created a 
holding environment for people who, 
maybe, felt marginalized themselves, 
and it’s been really exciting. That’s the 
heartwarming part. The other thing 
that I’m very proud of is creating a 
culture of assessment with an emphasis 
on documenting our impact on stu-
dent learning and really understand-
ing the difference we’re making when 
we do our programs and projects. So, 
that’s a culture shift to get people to 
think about establishing learning out-
comes and measuring them through 

their program development, but we’ve 
developed a lot of capacity and that’s 
now woven throughout our organiza-
tion.

G: What has been your most memo-
rable moment as vice chancellor?
R: The most memorable moment is 
certainly the Compton Cookout. It’s 
not what I’m most proud of, but it was 
searingly memorable, and I do believe 
that decisions that I helped make and 
actions that I took allowed the com-
munity to come together and heal 
through that process as opposed to 
really fall apart. I’m proud of what we 
created out of that very dark moment, 
and in fact the administrative commit-
ments we’ve made going forward that 
we’ve been able to honor and really 
make progress on.

G: What will you miss the most about 
UCSD?
R: The students. California is very 
distinctive. It is such [an] avant-
garde, if you will, sort of progres-
siveness. I think about the caliber 
of students that I’ve gotten to work 
with and the diversity of backgrounds 
that they come from and the spirit of 
sort of creating and entrepreneur-

ship that they have, and I think that’s 
really been exciting to me. That, and 
the beach. I’m a beach bum. I am a 
Triton for life. I have kept my Triton 
Day T-shirt, and I plan to wear that 
with pride on the other coast. I’m 
also very serious about the fact that 
UCSD is not as well known on this 
coast as it could be or should be — 
partly because we do operate a little 
bit in the shadow of the two other UC 
[schools] that are as highly ranked as 
we are — and of course, they have 
some PR assets in the shape of foot-
ball and basketball teams that catch 
the airwaves, so I’m really hoping to 
be an ambassador for UCSD back in 
the East Coast. 

G: Lastly, is there anything you want 
to say to the school or to the students?
R: I’ve really cherished my time here 
— it’s an amazing university. I’m just 
really honored to have been associ-
ated with that, and I will always feel a 
kinship. I will stay in touch with folks 
through our professional associations 
and through Facebook. I will always 
have a piece of San Diego in my heart.

Summer  movie  
preview 2013

S ometimes, a superhero just needs a facelift (or extensive full-body plastic surgery, as is the case in the Superman universe). America’s original super-
hero has begot a half-century of reboots and remakes 
since his 1951 film inception (including one gender 
change — 1984’s “Supergirl,” anyone?), each one fall-
ing several steps below the last. Of course, if anybody 
can lead a resurrection to glory, it’s Christopher Nolan 
(“The Dark Knight”). With Nolan running the show as 
producer and Zack Snyder directing, 2013’s “Man of 
Steel” will have to fall quite a long way to fail.

Part of reinventing this DC Comics hero dealt with 
making him a little more relatable and a little less invin-
cible — something difficult to accomplish, considering 
his only weakness is a glowing green space rock. Snyder 
and Nolan, however, trashed the Kryptonite, instead 
choosing to focus on the emotional vulnerabilities of 
Mr. Clark Kent, played by Henry Cavill (“The Tudors,” 
“Immortals”). “Man of Steel” tests Kent in far more 
than just physical ways as he is forced to reckon with 
both his true identity in the face of a global men-

ace — Kryptonian supremacist General Zod (Michael 
Shannon), to be exact — and his biological father’s 
resurgence (Jor-El, played by Russell Crowe).

In the midst of making a grittier, more modern 
Superman, the hero lost his classic red undies. Despite 
this, Superman’s origin story doesn’t stray too far from 
the original, as screenwriter David S. Goyer was sure to 
include Kent/Kal-El’s childhood flight from Krypton to 
Earth — albeit with a slight change in the stakes. “Man 
of Steel”’s Krypton features engineered children bred 
for specific purposes, making the natural-born Kal-El 
a crime purely by his existence. Jor-El sends his son to 
safety, and he lands in the hands of the country-grown 
Kents (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane), who teach him 
all he needs to know to be a humble, all-American boy. 
As an adult, Kent stays away from the beaten path, but 
fails to evade the attention of Daily Planet journalist 
Lois Lane (Amy Adams).

From a confused loner with a little too much 
strength to a purebred superhero, Clark Kent’s journey 
has been 75 years in the making — and with “Man of 
Steel,” Marvel may have finally met its match.

There is some-
thing to be said 
about a movie that 
has managed to 
gain a cult follow-
ing in the span of 
only three years, 
and in the case of 
the 2010 film “Kick-
Ass,” the film was 
quirky, heavily styl-
ized and practically 
violent enough to be 
“Kill Bill: Vol. 3.” It 
was also a thrilling 
film that left many 
audiences want-
ing more, and that’s 
where “Kick-Ass 2” 
comes in, slated to 
be another cartoon-
ish gore-fest.

It’s clear that 
there won’t be many 
major changes to the 

ideas that made the first film a success: Matthew Vaughn and Brad Pitt are back 
as producers, and the main cast members (sans Nicolas Cage, whose character 
died in the first film) have all returned. In the film’s second installment, the hero 
Kick-Ass (Aaron Johnson) has joined up with other vigilantes to fight crime, 
while his former accomplice, Hit-Girl (Chloe Grace Moretz), has decided to 
retire and live a normal life — though as superhero movies often go, it’s obvious 
that she won’t stick to her plan. Considering the duo’s sharp chemistry in the 
last film, their return will give the film a strong foundation. Christopher Mintz-
Plasse reprises his role as the main antagonist, though he’s changed his identity 
from Red Mist to — and this isn’t a joke — The Mother Fucker. 

Along with the cast from “Kick-Ass,” Jim Carrey assumes the role of a new-
comer vigilante, Colonel Stars and Stripes, complete with an army uniform and 
bandito face mask. With the dry-humored script that the first movie brought, 
there’s a lot of potential for Carrey’s performance to stand out, especially con-
sidering the brand of disturbed humor that he brings to his roles. Though it 
would probably make for an uncomfortable evening out with the family, “Kick-
Ass 2” is going to be a dark, idiosyncratic change of pace from the usual Marvel 
superheroes and a good bet for those who can handle a lot of violence.

Kick Ass 2

World  War  Z
The zombie virus 

has clearly infected 
moviegoers, as is evi-
denced by such success-
es as “Warm Bodies” 
and the hit AMC series 
“The Walking Dead.” 
The disease has spread, 
and summer 2013 will 
see the most ambitious 
interpretation of the 
genre. Some filmmakers 
stylize their re-animated 
corpses as slow and 
trudging, in homage to 
the zombies in George 
Romero’s 1968 classic 
“Night of the Living 
Dead.” “World War Z,” 
though, exhibits no 
such reverence, with 
hordes of sprinting 
flesh-eaters surging across cityscapes like undead tidal waves. 

Brad Pitt sports a goatee and chin-length hair as Gerry Lane, a man who 
sets about trying to solve the zombie crisis which has become a global pan-
demic. The film and the Max Brooks novel it was based on share a name 
and a protagonist employed by the U.N., but that’s where the similarities end. 
Fans expecting a cinematic rendition of the intimate personal accounts that 
comprised the novel are seeking out the wrong movie, as “World War Z” is 
shaping up to be a stand-alone story that mainly follows Lane’s endeavors to 
stop the zombie crisis. The drama rests on Lane’s love and care for his wife 
(Mireille Enos, “The Killing”) and his two daughters. His fight for humanity 
is, at its core, a fight to preserve his family. 

Director Marc Foster brings his experience with action movies from 
“Quantum of Solace” and “Machine Gun Preacher” to the table, with harrow-
ing rooftop chase scenes and zombie battles at 30,000 feet in the air. The film’s 
scope is tremendous, taking place in several global locations — including 
England, Scotland and Malta — over large expanses of city. “World War Z” 
has set itself apart from its undead counterparts: Rather than narrating the 
aftermath of a virus-ravaged world, it captures the zombie apocalypse in real 
time as it destroys the very ideas of normalcy and order.

Kristen Wiig graces the 
silver screen once again in 
the nationwide release of 
“Girl Most Likely.” Wiig plays 
Imogene Duncan, an unsuc-
cessful playwright who has 
recently been dumped by her 
boyfriend. In an act of des-
peration — or romanticism 
— she attempts suicide to win 
back her former love. Just like 
her career, her attempt fails, 
and Duncan is sent back to 
live with her dysfunctional, 
gambling-addict mother Zelda (Annette Bening, “The Kids are All Right”) 
because of her mental instability. Once she moves in, Duncan learns her moth-
er has shacked up with compulsive liar “George Boosh” (Matt Dillon, “There’s 
Something About Mary”) and has rented out her old room to a 20-something 
stranger named Lee (Darren Criss, “Glee”). “Girl Most Likely” allows Wiig to 
play — as she often does — her role as a slightly neurotic character but in the 
backdrop of a comedic setting with more depth.

Even with the new cinematic context, the talented cast members, among 
them Bening, who has four Academy Award nominations, and Criss, who 
has a fitting role as a dancer/singer in a Backstreet Boys cover band, accen-
tuate each other’s acting abilities. Although the script, written by Michelle 
Morgan and directed by veteran couple Shari Springer Berman and Robert 
Pulcini (“American Splendor,” “The Nanny Diaries”), doesn’t take risks in 
new comedic ventures, the film won’t let you down in its simplicity and 
memorability as an excellent summer comedy.

Robbery has never looked 
more glamorous than it 
does in Sofia Coppola’s lat-
est feature. Inspired by the 
infamous real-life 2009 

Hollywood Hills robberies, this part-crime drama, part-social commentary 
is sure to shed light on the fame-obsessed materialistic culture plaguing 
youth today. 

The film follows ringleader Rebecca (played by newcomer Katie Chang) 
and her accomplices, Marc (Isreal Brussard), Nicki (Emma Watson, “Perks 
of Being a Wallflower”), Chloe (Claire Julien) and Sam (Taissa Farmiga, 
“American Horror Story”) on their ventures to rob the homes of idolized 
celebrities. With the help of Google Maps, this group of well-dressed klep-
tomaniacs snags millions of dollars’ worth of items from stars like Paris 
Hilton (who makes a cameo), Orlando Bloom and Lindsay Lohan — to 
name a few. But all of the fun takes a sharp nosedive as the LAPD zeroes 
in on the ego-fueled convicts. The group must then face the consequences 
of their actions, whether from behind prison bars or under the media’s 
watchful eye. 

Aside from getting to see Emma Watson transform from a bookish 
wizard into a sultry, stiletto-wearing Hollywood criminal, Coppola is sure 
to have created a screenplay and film that far exceeds already high expec-
tations. If past projects like Oscar-winning “Lost in Translation” are any 
indication of the quality of her work, this flick will be much more than a 
group of rebellious teens misbehaving. In a way, the film reflects what an 
elitist generation can become when set loose in the city where “dreams 
come true.” A lethal dose of wealth and materialism in the Los Angeles 
nightclub scene can ignite even a teen to rob the homes of multi-million-
aires. Come summer, the hot designer item of the season will soon be a 
pair of slick chrome handcuffs.

With “Pacific Rim,” director Guillermo del Toro 
(“Pan’s Labyrinth,” “Hellboy”) finally seems to have fig-
ured out how to appeal to sci-fi aficionados and the gen-
eral populace alike with a trailer that’s meticulously opti-
mized to illicit responses of, “Holy shit, that’s awesome!” 
But rest assured, this is not merely a Transformers rip-off 
(a natural presumption considering Michael Bay’s ubiq-
uitous influence on the giant monster genre). Instead, 
del Toro delves into his love for Japanese Kaiju cinema, 
as seen in the original 1954 “Godzilla” film, to create his 
vision of human-piloted robots fighting giant aliens that 
spawn from an inter-dimensional portal.

In the hands of a skilled director like del Toro, 
“Pacific Rim” promises to be a spectacle that is more 
than the sum of its parts. The preadolescent CGI sub-
ject matter of robots-versus-aliens isn’t shrugged off as 
frivolous action under Del Toro’s steady hand; instead, 
it delivers the sentiment that the destruction on screen 
is momentous and truly shit-your-pants apocalyptic. 
Likewise, no long-winded setup or Hollywood love tri-
angle is present to distract from the central plot. Rather, 
del Toro is intent on focusing screen time on the conflict 
between the robots, called “Jaegers,” and their human 
pilots who attempt to control them.

If the image of a 300-foot-tall robot swinging a 
cargo ship at an alien (yes, this actually happens) isn’t 
enough for you, the CGI action is anchored by a cast of 
respected character actors. Charlie Hunnam (“Sons of 
Anarchy”) and Rinko Kikuchi (“Babel”) star as the lead 

copilots, while supporting actor Idris Elba (“The Wire,” 
“Prometheus”) bellows epic speeches and Charlie Day 
(“It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,” “Horrible Bosses”) 
puts his slapstick (and Rat Stick) away to play a wise, 
straitlaced scientist.

With a stellar cast and his own wealth invested in this 
film, del Toro treats his childlike obsession with robots 
maturely and seriously. The gaudy action and jerky cam-
erawork of Michael Bay is nowhere to be found here. 
Instead, we watch in awe as the colossal machines move 
their immensity slowly and deliberately, carrying the fate 
of the world squarely on their shoulders.

The  Lone  Ranger
Directed by Gore Verbinski
Starring Armie Hammer, Johnny Depp
Release Date July 3

Ah, America. There’s no better way to celebrate this 
year’s Independence Day than with a little trip back to 
the days of swashbuckling cowboys, native warriors and 
the Wild West. “The Lone Ranger,” which originated long 
before the time of John Wayne or “Walker, Texas Ranger” 
(sorry, Chuck Norris), is getting a reboot. From its 1933 
radio debut to the long-running 1950s television show, 
the adventures of the titular vigilante and his quick-witted 
Native American comrade have been slingin’ knuckles for 
quite some time.

This time around, the year is 1869, and the Ranger, 
given the name John Reid, is a city-educated lawyer who 
comes to Texas to instill his moral, righteous ways of life 
upon the community. However, after his partner (and 
older brother) is killed by the unrelenting Cavendish gang, 
he keeps his badge, throws out legalities, adds a mask 
and teams up with his capricious bird-hat-wearing savior, 
Tonto, to strike fear into outlaws and lawless officials alike.

Aside from keeping intact the series’ themes of justice 
and heroism and its endless catchphrases (“Hi-Yo, Silver! 
Away!” still rings across playgrounds nationwide), this 
summer’s “The Lone Ranger” is a different brand of the 
classic Western. Helmed by director Gore Verbinski and 
producer Jerry Bruckheimer (“Pirates of the Caribbean”), 
“Ranger” is a tour de force of Revisionist Western splendor. 
Armie Hammer’s (“The Social Network”) Ranger looks 
mighty fine and devilish as hell — and then there’s Johnny 

Depp. Depp both narrates and plays the wayward Tonto, 
reinventing the role from that of a mere sidekick to a jaunty 
warrior who will surely display some of the actor’s eccentric 
mannerisms. Throw in some not-so-surprising cohorts 
(Helena Bonham Carter, we’re lookin’ at you) and quite an 
impressive update to the original’s action sequences (if only 
Clayton Moore could see that train explode), and the film’s 
visually magnificent soiree is sure to blow you away.

So, kemosabe — come July 4, get your ass to the 
movie theater.

The target audience for “Monsters University” may be 
the little ones, but the latest Pixar flick very well may be 
more relatable for undergrads this summer, between Greek 
rivalries, dorm pranks and four-year degrees in “scaring.”

Maybe not that last one.

“MU” takes fans of “Monsters, Inc.” back to the wild 
college days of our favorite creatures before they became 
best friends and co-workers. Billy Crystal and John 
Goodman reprise their vocal roles of the one-eyed Mike 
Wazowski and hairy Sulley as incoming freshmen at the 
eponymous college. Much to their chagrin, the teenaged 
monsters — both “scaring” majors — are forced to be 
roommates and become instant rivals, as each aspires to 
be the most ferocious monster on campus. When offered a 
chance to reach this goal by participating in an inter-Greek 
competition (a la Harry Potter’s Triwizard Tournament) 
the pair must set their personal differences aside to work 
together effectively.

The film will be another in a long line of Pixar films 
filled with quick wit, lots of heart and an all-star cast of 
quirky creatures voiced by the likes of Steve Buscemi 
(reprising his role as “Monsters, Inc.” antagonist, Randy), 
Helen Mirren as the stern dean of MU and Charlie Day as 
an eccentric, elusive, hippie new age philosophy student.

Even Pixar has, in recent years, resorted to Hollywood’s 
dreaded backup plan: more sequels, less originality. Pixar 
fans — and Disney’s ever-growing bank — can rest assured, 
however, that whatever Pixar churns out will be fresh and 
innovative. “MU” may be Pixar’s first sequel, but let’s not 
forget that it’s created by the same studio that undoubtedly 
set the bar for sequels and prequels alike with 2010’s “Toy 
Story 3.” Audiences will enjoy seeing these classic Pixar 
characters in their younger years: a little more energetic, a 
little less mature and just as lovable as they are rescuing the 
adorable toddler Boo years later.

F irst, a story: My first taste of journal-ism came in the fourth grade, when my teacher partnered us up and told 
us to interview each other and write an 
article. The assignment was a disaster — in 
the subsequent parent-teacher conferences, 
I learned what libel is and the true mean-
ing of the word “cremation.” Upon exiting 
the last talk with my unamused teacher, 
my mother turned to me and said, “Well, 
at least we know you’ll never become a 
journalist.”

Oops.
The next time I wrote an article 

was eight years later, when I joined the 
Guardian my freshman year in a fit of sad, 
lonely desperation — something I can con-
fidently say now that I am no longer sad 
and lonely and desperate. In those three 
years, I went from a caustic, angry, overly 
defensive “writer” to a caustic, angry, less 
defensive “editor” at a paper that tested my 
patience at every turn. I can credit over 75 
percent of my job acceptances and 100 per-
cent of my gray hairs to this job.  

I came looking for a distraction from 
my bathed-in-hellfire freshman suite and 
found a community of bright, ambitious 
student journalists who later became my 
family. 

For the shout outs:
Angela, light of my life, our relationship 

has tested the boundaries of appropriate 
work relationships. You have made me 
a better person and writer and have for-
given me in times where I still don’t feel I 
deserved forgiveness. I’m also thankful that 
Brooklyn won’t require you to drive.

Arielle, “Trivia Newton-John” will live 

on. I couldn’t have asked for a brighter, 
more capable person to weather the shit-
storm of managing editorship. 

Rachel, I’m really sorry about the swim-
ming articles, and I’m even more sorry that 
I wrote one on the wrong meet and knitted 
while you tried to fix it. 

Mina, in an ideal world, every night 
would be a “Mean Girls”-midnight-
McDonald’s-run kind of night. 

Emily, you have been the rock that has 
held the Guardian together for four long 
years. Thank you. 

Regina, Hayley, Trevor, Becky, Nikki, 
Andrew, Leo, Ren, Neda, Nathan, Rebecca, 
I am forever grateful for the Snapples, 
microwaveable beef stroganoff and endless 
pep talks when things were too grim to 
comprehend. 

Laira, I am really glad I convinced you 
to come back to the Guardian. You’re no 
longer a minion now — I’m proud of you. 
Oh, I’m sorry I turned your office upside 
down.

My opinion girls, Maddy and Hilary, 
and the wunderkind Ayan, you always 
brightened up my day with your endless 
sass and cheer. 

Zev, a good man is hard to find, and 
only you would let me throw a cup of water 
in your face. Twice. 

Mahaila, and TMTV too, I am so grate-
ful for the endless dinner parties, Minecraft 
and games of Clue when I stumbled home 
a basket case. 

To everyone else, the new editors and 
writers I should have gotten to know bet-
ter and anyone I never meant to forget, I’m 
sorry for being “Mean Margaret.”

Good bye &

( 1 ) “The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it.” Henry David Thoreau
(2) From my journal, Jan. 12, 2010, during my 

first week as news editor:
The sacrifices I’m making for the Guardian — 

and how utterly sad they make me and how yet 
I realize the necessity of what I’m doing — make 
me realize that I have never had to truly sacrifice 
something before. I’ve finally found something 
that’s important enough to me to give up almost 
everything else. 

(3) From my journal, Nov. 15, 2012, the night I 
decided to step down after having been editor-in-
chief for seven quarters: I want different avenues 
for my abilities, my loves, my interests. The 
Guardian has cut off the different avenues for far 
too long.

(4) The best things in life — job, friendship, 
love — fell into my lap the week after I quit the 
Guardian last November. This synchronicity 
seemed to confirm my shadowiest doubts: that 
my fervent and irrational devotion to the paper 
had given me tunnel vision, that I was serving an 
institution that had long ceased to serve me, that 
the price was too high. 

It is only now, six months removed, that I real-
ize my time here did not keep me from the best 
things in life, but rather laid the foundation for 
them. During the years when I felt myself to be 
stagnant and each production to be useless, the 
6 a.m. productions were building the diligence 
and sense of purpose that won me the job, the 
emergency editorial meetings forging friendships 
that to me now feel sacred, the ambition and stiff 
upper lip irrevocably shaping the person that my 
covivant would love.

(5) Here, in chronological order, are the people 
I loved (at different times, in different ways) dur-
ing the past four years: Reza, Alyssa, Simone, 
Emily, Hayley, Regina, Trevor, Margaret, Arielle, 
Mina, Rachel, Zev, Mark, Henry. It speaks well 
that all but the last two are people I found on the 
second floor of the Old Student Center. 

(6) Here are the people I expect to continue 
the paper I loved so much: Laira, Zev. Please 
remember that the correct style is 2012–13, not 
2012–2013. I have been trying not to comment on 
this, but now I can’t keep quiet.  

(7) The price was never too high. The 
Guardian, and everything it came with, is — more 
than my family, more than my classes, more than

S E N I O R  T H E  U C S D  G U A R D I A N  |  T H U R S D AY,  J U N E  6 ,  2 0 1 3  |  W W W. U C S D G U A R D I A N . O R G  9

There were times when working for the Guardian felt like leading a double life. In the eyes of my friends outside of the 
newspaper, “production” was like a coma 
I’d slip in and out of twice a week — lost 
hours of the college experience that I’d 
never regain. For me, the 22-hour work 
days could fly by in a caffeine and candy 
fueled haze — outside of normal time, at 
once plodding and mundane, frenzied and 
memorable. 

Waking up from a production could 
be like waking up from the worst kind of 
nightmare, with the vague realization that 
there was definitely a typo on the front page 
like my version of a death dream. Of course, 
the camaraderie of the Guardian staff and 
my love of the paper made the constant fear 
enjoyable. Maybe we’re all masochists here, 
but it was in the most stressful times that I 
began to make lifelong friendships and test 

my strength as an individual. 
It’s been hard for me to say goodbye. I 

love everyone who survived this beautiful 
nightmare of a college experience with me 
(Guardian or otherwise), and I’ll miss you 
all wherever I end up. 

But for now, on to the shout outs:
Amy: Thanks for being the best distrac-

tion from my stress at the Guardian and 
making our little apartment a home. 

Angela: People usually give you props 
for your strength and your intelligence and 
your power dresses, but I’ll always remem-
ber you as the first person on the Guardian 
to make me feel comfortable when I was 
just a petrified design shadow. 

Margaret: In our managing editor hys-
teria, you got grey hair, and I lost hair, but 
it would have been so much worse without 
each other. It’s no coincidence that, post-
Guardian, we still make great teammates 

(albeit bar trivia is slightly less stressful than 
producing a newspaper). 

Laira & Zev: I am so proud of how 
much you guys have stepped up to the plate 
(sloshball included). Watching you guys run 
the show has made it so much easier to let 
go of the Guardian this quarter.

Ren: Thanks for pretending like I had 
something to teach you when you were bril-
liant to begin with. Most critics are all talk, 
but you actually have the potential to best 
the art we shat all over. I hope the Guardian 
isn’t our last collaboration, but we’ll always 
be friends regardless.

Andrew: I don’t remember how I con-
vinced you to join this mess, but I’m glad we 
got to impart our musical pretension upon 
Hiatus together. You’ve felt like an old friend 
from the start.

Mina: Thanks for going on the PU$$Y 
P0PPIN quest for female empowerment 

with me. Only you could rival Nicki Minaj 
in my eyes. 

Neda: My partner in crime — the Queen 
of Shenanigans — this year has been unmis-
takably hard without you. If this was your 
high school yearbook, I’d sign a whole page 
of stupid, inside jokes we’d probably forget 
in a few years. No sentimentality needed — 
I know we’re homegirls for life.

EmKu: Your insight and encouragement 
helped me through my toughest quarter this 
year. Thanks for hiring me when I was just a 
barely competent designer and teaching me 
to be so much better.

To the rest of the Old Guard: You’re the 
people that made me realize the Guardian is 
where I belonged in college, and you contin-
ue to inspire me today. And to all the other 
Guardians I’ve had the pleasure of working 
with: It has been an honor. Go big or go 
home, and never stop making the G proud.

H ere is a little secret: my favorite nap spot on campus is the sofa in the Guardian office — half an hour every day, four days a week.As Ferris Bueller said, “Life moves pretty fast. If you don’t stop and look 
around once in a while, you could miss it.” And guess what? I missed it. I missed 
a least two Bear Gardens, a Sun God, three office parties and many other dances. 
Between working and taking five classes every quarter to graduate on time, my 
little spare time was spent either sleeping in the office or eating drunken noodles 
with Hilary.

My love for art and literature made me join the Guardian as one of their 
designers, but my friends and the people who work here make it feel like more 
than just a job. It’s something that you work for — for very little money, but you 
don’t care; there are issues and problems you have to deal with every time, but 
you just can’t get enough. And for the two years I stayed, I made some really good 
friends: Emily, Chengela, Raquel, Yaugret, Zeff, Becky…

I lost count of how many times we listened to “We Are Never Ever Getting 

Back Together” and “Call Me Maybe” during production or how many time we 
laughed over silly quotes. Things like newsroom hockey, hopscotch and dodge-
ball didn’t help to get the pages done any quicker, but we wouldn’t have been the 
Guardian staff without them.

There comes a time in every man’s life when he wants to evaluate what he has 
done after college, and to me, all of my achievements were as a result of counting 
on friends and family. They are a part of it all. So I thank them for being a part of 
my art shows, my student films and my work. I’m happy to share my contribution 
to the Guardian. Every issue we put out is a collaborative work, and I’m proud to 
be a part of the experience the same way the Guardian was a part of mine.

And to my design team, Sara, Zoe, Amber and Dorothy: You guys are awe-
some. You guys are so weird, and I’m sorry that you inherited my awkwardness 
when you became designers. I’m glad we met and worked together. I see great 
potential in you guys, and I’m happy that the legacy of good design from the 
Guardian passes on with you all. Keep up the good work and be creative.

W hen I started writing for the Guardian, I felt out of place. And why wouldn’t I? Next to 
my well-dressed, smooth-talking, 
semi-hipster colleagues, I was an 
uncultured country mouse. I hadn’t 
seen their art house movies, hadn’t 
listened to their Indie records 
(Shostakovich, anyone?), hadn’t 
smoked at their Hillcrest hookah 
bars. Worse yet, I studied biology 
and not literature, so all the jokes 
about post-structural ecosophy and 
Jacques Derrida went straight over 
my head.

But when I actually started 
working, the work was breathtak-
ing. I interviewed the foreign min-
ister of Israel and the governor of 
California, as well as winners of the 
Nobel and Pulitzer prizes. I inter-
viewed James Cameron (director of 
“Avatar” and “Titanic”) and Stephen 
Hawking (theoretical physicist and 
overall winner at life). I interviewed 
student activists and politicians and 
witnesses of police brutality — peo-
ple completely unlike myself. And 
with every interview, I’ve gotten 
better at getting complete strangers 
to open up, at getting them to let 
me inside their heads.

These incredible experiences 
gave me something to talk about. 
At some point halfway through 
my freshman year, the way I felt at 
the office shifted. I walked taller. 
I smiled more openly. I raised my 
voice and laughed warmly, chatting 
about stories I’d written and the 
places I’d been. I started to make 
friends, including some of the clos-
est ones I have at UCSD. I began 
to rely on them, professionally and 
personally, and in turn, they began 
to rely on me.

Some shout-outs:
Angela and Margaret: Not 

only are you the Guardian’s cut-
est couple, you’ve been my parents 
at the paper. You’ve taught me so 
much about writing, reporting and 
keeping calm in times of stress. 
Remember when I used to be 
scared of you, Margaret?

Maddy: When I met you, my 
first thought was, “How can some-
one as radiantly beautiful, shocking-
ly intelligent and downright ador-
able as Madeline Mann exist?” My 
second thought was, “Hey, she kind 
of looks like Taylor Swift.” Since 
that first encounter, your cheerful-
ness and practical insight have got-
ten me through many a rough patch 
at UCSD.

Laira and Arielle: Both of you had 
the unenviable task of following up 
Angela’s term as EIC, and both of you 
did an incredible job. Props on the 
design improvements (Arielle) and 
making things even more efficient 
(Laira). It was a blast working for both 
of you. Laira, you’re going to do amaz-
ing things next year: I know it.

Hilary: My graduating doesn’t 
change anything. We’re going to 
drink boba — and laugh bitterly 
about life — for the rest of our 
lives. Promise.

Stacey and Mozelle: You are the 
nicest, sweetest people I’ve met at 
UCSD, and you’re the future of the 

section that was my baby for the 
better part of this year. I couldn’t 
think of anyone better to pass the 
reins to. I love you both dearly and 
can’t wait to see what you do with 
the section this coming year.

Mekala, Aleksandra and 
Vincent: You’re the future of this 

paper. It’s been a pleasure working 
with you for the last few months. 
Take it easy, make sure you eat 
at regular intervals (don’t faint!), 
and make the paper your baby. 
Together, you have more than 
enough raw talent to bring the 
Guardian into its next “golden age.”

not having a dream. I didn’t care 
if my ability to remember dreams 
went away, I didn’t want to run into 
that hideous girl in my unconscious. 

There had always been a little 
fear with dreaming: You never know 
what you’re going to get. Being able 
to remember the finer details of 
my dream sometimes makes me a 
little scared to close my eyes at night 
because it felt so real.

If seeing the girl from “The 
Ring” in a movie had me peeing in 
my pants, I didn’t want to know how 
it would feel to see her in a dream. 
It was a scary experience for me, 
and because my dreams felt so real 
I don’t think I could handle it if I 
were to have a nightmare about her. 
My dreams blurred the line between 
fictitious imagination and reality 
because I was actually experienc-
ing it.

It doesn’t even have to be after I 
watch a scary movie; it could be see-
ing a frightening image that made 
me nervous and paranoid.

To this day, I have not had a 
dream about “The Ring.” But 
then again, I don’t remember my 
dreams on most nights nowadays. 
My suppression had undoubtedly 
affected my recollection abilities. 
Nevertheless, I do continue to keep 
a dream diary. There are still the 
occasional nightmares and freaky 
dreams, but that had always hap-
pened even before the dream repres-
sion.

As I said in an earlier column, 
dreams are like a double-edged 
sword. It involuntarily sucks you 
into a world you may not have been 
able to conjure on your own — a 
world you may never want to enter. 
But it is this capriciousness and 
randomness — never knowing what 
you’re going to get — that gets me 
hooked on figuring it all out.

I want to continue working on 
my dream diary, and maybe one 
day I’ll be strong enough to lift 
this mental suppression that I have 
placed on myself. I think dreaming 
is like love: It’s better to have expe-
rienced it and be hurt than to have 
never known it at all.

O f all the seniors in today’s issue, I’ve been writing for the Guardian for the shortest amount of time. 
Just last summer I drafted the first 
brostallment of my column Bro’s Eye 
View. So I just want to say this: The 
Guardian is great. 

The amount of work that this staff 
puts into every bi-weekly issue is 
crazy. My editors worked truly self-
lessly to send me back dozens of edits 
on every column and treated words 
that would be printed under my 
name as carefully as if they were their 
own. They’d thoughtfully respond to 
my babbling 2 a.m. revelations about 
column ideas and rhetorical struc-
ture. With the amount of high-caliber 
content they pump out at such an 
under-involved campus, I’m a little 
embarrassed I took the Guardian for 
granted as long as I did. 

You should try to write for the 
Guardian. While I probably spent 

more time puzzling over how to 
phrase my column than on any of my 
classes, I’m grateful for the oppor-
tunity I was given to express how I 
see our student life. And not only 
will your writing skills improve, but 
if you work for this paper you’ll also 
get to know this eclectic, funny and 
grammatically-sound staff. 

At the least, you should try to read 
every issue. The Guardian as I know it 
doesn’t play the tumultuous and often 
deceitful campus politics prevalent in 
A.S. Council, but they do inject infor-
mation and reason into campus-wide 
debates. They have the podium to 
inform the collective discussion and 
like real journalists they wield that 
power responsibly. 

Next year even though I’m under-
going the existential tragedy known as 
graduation, I’m going to keep reading 
the Guardian to find out what’s going 
down at UCSD. You should too.

I came to the Guardian looking for a job. Instead, I found a community. I started out writing for the Focus section, and I sucked. I 
wrote three articles before I realized that I was 
better off elsewhere. Elsewhere turned out to 
be News. I enjoyed News. I got to write about 
things that I thought were important to students, 
whether it was an article on campus crime or an 
article about UCSD researchers’ latest endeav-
ors. I learned that our student government was 
mostly bureaucratic bullshit when I tortured 
myself with writing the A.S. Column for two 
quarters. I learned how to use InDesign when 
I spent a few months working for Design. I 
learned how to manage a team of writers under 
two different news editors when I was an associ-
ate news editor.

But out of all of the experience I gained, 
the thing that stands out to me most is the 
people I worked with. After every terrible 
A.S. Council meeting, I came back to a team 
of editors who I could complain to. When I 
spent over 10 hours at each production, I had 
at least three other coworkers to commiserate 
with. My favorite memories will be of all of 
the great people I met. I’ll always treasure the 
friends I made while working in the hectic 
environment of a newspaper.

Laira, I’ve loved seeing you grow. You’ve 
done an excellent job as the new editor-in-
chief, and I’m really excited to see how the 
paper changes under your leadership.

Zev, the paper needs you as a managing edi-
tor. Everyone has to grow up at some point, and 
now, it’s your turn. Maybe the grass is always 
greener on the other side, but what you’ve 

moved on to is greater, and it will give you expe-
rience that News never could.

Allie, I’m so sad that I won’t get to see you 
twice a week. You have the best stories and 
great perspective. Rock the MQ (the Guardian 
will miss you).

Claire, you are an adorable, loving person, 
full of compassion. A million hugs.

Mekala, you have a really difficult job. And 
despite the fact that you were pushed into 
this, I know that News was left in good hands. 
Remember that you have the ultimate authori-

ty over News, and use that as much as you can.
Aleks, Clovis sucks. But I still love you. 

Listen to Mekala and continue to shine like the 
sun.

Madeline, keep singing. Someday, Taylor 
Swift will go on tour with you.

Angela, you’ve taught me so much while 
managing to scare the hell out of me at the 
same time. Great things are in your future.

Arielle, you’re one of the most badass 
women I’ve ever met and I can’t wait to see 
where that takes you.

Mina, I’ll always respect your mix of kind-
ness and your “don’t mess with me” attitude.

Margaret, keep up your sassy wit forever. 
I’ll miss you!

Leo, you’ve got the greatest Photoshop 
skills ever. I am constantly in awe of your 
design work — and the fact that you were in 
a Britney Spears music video.

Nathan, you are one of the funniest, most 
interesting and chill people I’ve ever met.

America and Vishal, please come back. 
We miss you.

F irst off, I want to say thanks to the amazingly talented Erik Jepsen for hiring me all those 
years ago. I’m sure my portfolio was 
absolute crap, but I’m forever grateful 
you took me in. I can’t imagine how 
differently my college life would have 
gone had I not been able to shoot for 
the Guardian. You take such incred-
ible photos, and I’m honored to have 
worked under you.

Next up is John Hanacek! Thanks 
for bringing me into the associate 
position. I probably wouldn’t have 
gotten to know you or the rest of 
the staff nearly as well if it weren’t 
for that. We got to photograph some 
amazing stuff together, and I had a 
great time working with you.

I also have to thank Nolan 
Thomas and Brian Monroe for 
being the associate photo editors and 
spending all that FUN time at the 
office making extraordinarily tedious 
cut-outs of athletes and their long 
flowing hair sweeping majestically 
behind them. You guys helped me 
out so much, and I’m so very grateful 
for your effort.

Of course, I can’t forget my huge 
staff (heh) of photographers. Thank 
you so much for shooting all those 
events. Whether it was a kick-ass 
concert or a three-person meeting, 
you guys were there, snapping away. 
I know wasn’t always glamorous or 
fun, but please know how thankful I 
was when one of you would volunteer 
to shoot even the lamest of events.

Finally, I want to give my love and 
thanks to the rest of the Guardian 
staff, past and present. From the 
writers to the exec staff to the artists 
and the distribution people, I’m so 
happy to have worked with a group 
as hardworking and talented as you 
guys. We busted our asses and totally 
didn’t get enough recognition for it, 
but I’m very proud of the work that 
we did. I’m very excited to see what 
the future holds for all of you and for 
the Guardian as well!andrew   oh

I t’s over. This is the last time you’ll read my liberal bullshit printed in this newspaper. (Unless I decide to send in some letters: Saad Asad, Alumnus 2013!) Who knew it would even last this long? I originally started working for the Guardian because nobody 
else wanted to hire me. But then I started getting paid to write opinions. Yes, you read 
that right, someone wanted to pay me for my blatherings. Eventually though, I stopped 
getting paid because of budget cuts. It’s cool though, I still got to talk about whatever I 
wanted every other week in a publication that was read by thousands of people. 

If there is anything I’ve learned over the years, it’s that you have to write out “percent” 
and can’t use the symbol, according to the AP Style Guide. I guess I also learned how to 
research stories, formulate opinions and communicate them to readers, but I think that 
style tip overshadows any of that. Facetiousness aside, this has truly been a wonderful 
experience, and I’m glad I was able to write for this newspaper these last three years and 
met some awesome people.

Mad props to my opinion editors throughout the years for making my rants more 
comprehensible (Cheryl Hori, Margaret Yau, Madeline Mann, Hilary Lee, all of you!).  
And thank you readers for your passionate comments on my articles. I wouldn’t be here 
without you. I bid you all farewell with this classic quote from Yoda in Stargate SG-1, 
“Live Long and Prosper.”

I vividly remember the first article I wrote on Facebook privacy as an innocent sophomore. More notably, I still remember the disappointment, frustration and tears after this mere 300-word piece was edited to pieces. Way back then, I thought I knew how to effectively convey my strong opinions 
to the masses — I had much to learn.

On a micro level, my time at the Guardian has taught me how to write effectively. On a grander 
scheme, it has allowed me to voice in on issues I am passionate about such as my experiences creating 
diversity initiatives for women in engineering and breaking gender stereotypes. In the form of a girl 
named Hilary Lee, it has also given me a ticket to some of the craziest weekends of my life thus far. I 
can’t even believe we’ve stayed out downtown until 10 a.m., snuck onto a party bus, escaped from the 
police and met pretty much the entire navy base. And that doesn’t even scratch the surface. 

When I first began this journey at UCSD, I never would have imagined that I would end up grad-
uating at the top of my class, being the president of an organization, a Residential Advisor to a group 
of freshman, a proud female engineer or the senior staff writer for the school newspaper — all while 
partying without fail every weekend. I’d like to think that the Guardian is what first gave me this bal-
ance in life, and for that I am forever grateful.

As a graduating senior, I can officially say that I have found myself at this university, and that I 
truly call this place home. Now numerous quick takes, main stories and missed deadlines later, it’s 
time for me to say goodbye to the Guardian. It’s been an unforgettable experience.

THUY PHAM TTP020@ucsd.eduDREAMING  IN  TECHNICOLOR 

Summer has a way of sneaking up on you, and then — just like that — you realize that school starts in 
10 days and the most memorable thing you did during break was eat ice cream straight out of the pint. 

So don’t wait for the last few weeks of summer to start living it up. Here are some summer ideas. 

I t was Halloween during my freshman year at UCSD. I remember I went trick-or-
treating that night with a few of 
my suitemates and after hauling 
our candy back to the dorms, our 
sugar-rushed minds decided on 
watching a movie. The occasion 
called for a horror film.

Background: I’m terrified of 
scary movies. My parents would 
watch scary movies about can-
nibalistic killers with a lot of gore 
when I was young. They never 
considered the fact that a five year 
old shouldn’t be watching someone 
getting chopped up. 

However, I had momentarily 
forgotten this fear in the light of 
hanging out with my suitemates. I 
agreed to watch “The Ring.”

Twenty minutes in, I let out my 
first scream. Maybe it was the sugar 
rush, but I ended up frantically 
holding onto the person next to 
me. My hyperness had transitioned 
into dread and fear.

My roommate on the bottom 
bunk was tossing and turning in 
her sleep as if she was having a 
nightmare. The thought that I 
might have a nightmare as well 
scared the bejesus out of me. 
I imagined the girl from “The 
Ring” underneath my bed. After 
the movie ended, my hyperactive 
imagination ran through every pos-
sible horrendous situation in my 
mind. I imagined her crawling out 
of the well in my dream; I imagined 
her chasing me. The list went on 
and on: My mind would conjure 
up her face. I deeply regretted my 
decision not to opt out of watching 
that movie. 

I repeated over and over: Please 
don’t let me remember my dream 
tonight. Please don’t let me remem-
ber my dream tonight. This mantra, 
and a lot of concentration, had 
somehow enabled me to suppress 
my dreams that night. When I woke 
up I didn’t remember a thing.

But then, I didn’t remember a 
lot of things after that night.

I could no longer recall my 
dreams every day. My fear of hav-
ing a nightmare still progressed. I 
knew that I might not get a night-
mare that night, but it could be 
days later when I think I’m safe that 
the nightmare bites me in the ass.

I was more fearful of dreaming 
up the girl in “The Ring” than

1. Go to the beach. Kick o" summer with a bumping beach day. Soak 
up some Vitamin D, throw a Frisbee around, surf, boogie board 
or build a sandcastle. As the sun sets, end the day with a bon#re 
complete with s’mores, hot dogs and groovy music.

2. Take a lot of pictures, and master the art of the sel!e. $e 
summer sky and sun make beautiful backdrops for even the most 
un%attering pictures. Carry your camera everywhere to document 
the highs and lows of summer 2013.

3. Live for the single life. Change your Facebook status to “single,” 
and let loose this summer with your closest friends and family. You 
can rekindle your relationship during the winter season when your 
summer tan fades, and you need a cuddle buddy to stay toasty. 

4. Learn to play an instrument. Be it guitar, harmonica or the 
triangle, tap into your inner musician and jam. 

5. Write a song. If you followed entry three, then you probably have 
some pent up emotions that you need to release. Use your musical 
skills from entry four, channel your inner Taylor Swi&, move on, 
and enjoy summer. 

6. Movies. Make a huge batch of popcorn, settle down on the couch, 
and have a marathon of your favorite shows and movies that you 
didn’t get to watch during the year. For a change in scenery, pry 
yourself o" the couch, and get cozy in the back of your car at the 
drive-in movie theater.

7. Give thanks every day. Gratitude is the best attitude.

8. Take a road trip. Load sandwiches and b into a cooler, download 
some summer tunes (for car dancing, of course), grab your best 
friends, and hit the road. Explore the California coast on the 101, 
take the historic Route 66 from Los Angeles to Chicago, or simply 
see where the road takes you.

9. County Fairs. Wherever you are spending summer, hunt down a 
county fair nearby. Stu" your face with cheesy fries, warm pretzels, 
greasy corn dogs and crispy funnel cakes. $en, hit the amusement 
park rides and hope you don’t see all that food a second time. 

10. Go camping. Round up your entourage, and get in touch with 
nature on a beach camping trip, or venture into the desert for some 
stargazing. 

11. Find platform 9 ¾. Hop onto your Firebolt, and %y on over to $e 
Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios in Orlando, 
Florida. Snap a photo or two with Buckbeak the Hippogri", get 
drunk o" of Butterbeer, or go wand shopping at Ollivanders Wand 
Shop. Make sure to watch out for those bloody Dementors. 

12. Pull a prank. Empty a tub of mayonnaise, #ll it with vanilla 
pudding, and eat it in public. Count how many people gag when 
they see you.

13. Learn to twerk. Channel Miley Cyrus’ unicorn swag, and express 
yourself on the dance %oor. 

14. Be in four states at once: Visit the Four Corners — the intersection 
point of the four states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and 
Utah. 

15. Say “I love you” more. While you are reunited with your family 
and friends, take some time to show them how much you care with 
these three little words. 

16. Blast from the past. Dust o" your yearbooks, and reconnect with 
at least one person from your high school glory days. Don’t wait for 
your 10-year high school reunion to catch up with your buddies, 
because — let’s face it — in 10 years, you won’t look nearly as good 
as you do now. Seize the day.

17. Start a food !ght. Add some fun to any summer barbecue with a 
%ying mass of potato salad or a hamburger slap across the face. 

18. Hold up a sign o#ering “free hugs.” For some people, summer 
doesn’t cure unhappiness. Make someone’s day, and put a smile on 
his or her face with a hug. 

19. Be unpredictable. Feel like running through the sprinklers with 
your clothes on or having a randomly intense make-out session on a 
Ferris Wheel? Go for it — as long as it’s legal.
