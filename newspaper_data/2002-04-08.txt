Student arrested 
for syringe assault 
Suspect allegedly injected three 
victims with tranquilizing drugs 
By EVAN McLAUCiHUN 
Associate News Editor 

Police arrested UCSD stu-
dent Peter Butcher, 21, on 
Saturday, April 6 in San Diego. 
They allege that he stabbed three 
people with a syringe, injecting 
them with a tranquilizing drug. 

Butcher faces charges of 
assault with a deadly weapon and 
remains in jail on a bail of 
$250,000. 

According to the Santa 
Barbara Sheriff's Department, 
who issued a warrant for his 
arrest, Butcher is under investi-
gation for three separate syringe 
attacks. Two of the attacks 
occurred along Santa Barbara 
beaches, where Butcher makes 
his permanent residence, on Jan. 
II as well as last Friday, April 5. 
The other attack he is being 
linked with occurred on Jan. 20 
in Mammoth Lakes, Calif., coin-
ciding with a snowboard compe-
tition at which he is known to 
have competed as a member of 

the UCSD snowboard team. 
Investigators in the case said 

they believe that Butcher took 
pleasure in watching the victims 
lose consciousness; they note that 
none of the known victims were 
sexually assaulted. 

"People do different things for 
different reasons," Lt. Bill Byrne 
of the Santa Barbara sheriff's 
office told the Stlnttl Btlrbtlrtl 
Nt'Ws- fuss. "We believe that he 
enjoyed watching his victims 
after they began to go into their 
panic-like state." 

In ' Friday's attack, Santa 
Barbara police say, a 20-year-old 
female was jogging along an Isla 
Vista beach when she was stabbed 
with a syringe containing a drug 
that caused her to lay uncon-
scious for over three hours. She 
was discovered when a man walk-
ing a dog heard the victim cry for 
help from the ground. 

On Jan. II, a 63-year-old 
female was stabbed when a male

Presidential candidates 
square off in debate 
Forum remained civil as they read from scripts 
By EVAN McLAUCiHUN 
Associate Nelll/S Editor 

Candidates for the A.S. presi-
dency convened in Price Center 
Pl aza o n Thursday to tackl e 
impending undergraduate issues 
for the upcoming 2002-03 school 
year. While the event was billed as 
a debate, there was little dialogue 
or confrontation between the can-
didates due to the format imple-
mented by the elections commit-
tee. 

In the debate, candidates were 
each allotted one minute to answer 
the question presented to them by 
mediator Kyle Biebesheimer. Once 
every candidate replied, they were 
each permitted an additional 
minute to respond to answers given 

by their opponents. 
T he debate fo rmat was intended 

to spark some confrontation 
between the contenders, 
Biebesheimer said. T he response 
round was employed so that a candi-
date had the opportuni ty to politely 

di~agree or even lambaste another 
candidate's stance on an issue. 

"The elections committee want-
ed to mix up the format a bit to try to 
get some direct debating between 
the candidates," Biebeshei mer said. 
"Unfortunately, the new format was 
not as effective as we thought." 

For the most part, the debaters 
shied away from this opportunity to 
challenge their opponents and stuck 
strictly to informing the audience of 
their thoughts and ide~ about the 
issues. Candidates did begin to 

respond di rectly to statements made 
by their opponents as the debate 
progressed, however mildly. 

Anotller facet of the debate for-
mat provided that candidates wert 
given the debate questions prior to 
the event. According to 
Biebesheimer, candidates were given 
the oppornl nity to research the top-
ics so that th e event cou ld run 
smoothly wi thout candidates stnlg-
gling to find answer . 

Some debate attendees found the 
candidates' statements to be roo 
rehearsed and lacking the spontane-
ity they wished to see. 

" It was almost like [the candi-
dates] were reading up there," said 
Jason Korniski , a sophomore at Earl

UCSD clubs host weekend 'Pro,

Meetings drew

By TOM NEELEY 
Contributing Writer 

UCSD was the site of the West 
Coast Pro-America Student 
Conference this weekend , which 
attracted students from colleges 
throughout California to discuss 
ways they could better support 
America on their campuses. 

Attendees from othel uc cam-
puses came from Berkeley, Irvine, 
Los Angeles, Riverside and Santa 
Cruz. The University of Southern 
California and Biola University in 
La Mirada, Calif. , also had atten-
dees. 

"For a lot of people, conservative 
activism seems like an oxymoron," 
said organizer VInce Vasquez of the 
UCSD Conservative Union. "But I 
think as anyone with convictions, 
anyone who lives in an environment 
where theres diversity and embraces 
that diversity, we always want to be 
talking about what makes us differ-
ent." 

TItled "Defending Freedom and 
Supporting America on Campus," 
the conference featured a variety of

Addressing the issues facing con-

A.S. in 
favor of 
fee hike 
Resolution passes 
in A.S. Council 
unanimously 
By MAR(;ARET O'NEILL 
Sentor Staff Writer 

.\ rc~olution in upport of the 
Studcnt In iriated Ath letic Fee, 
\\'hlch would impose a fee of $28.25 
per quarter on undergraduates, 
pa.,~ed the t\ .S . Counci l unanimous-
ly b,t \Vednesday. 

The measure wi II be voted upon by 
the undergraduate student body this 
week, ,\'londay through Friday, as a 
parr of the A.S. Council elections. 

The cuunci l has nor, in the past, 
t;tken a side on issues such as referen-
dUl1ls. A.S. President Jeff Dodgc, who 
Juthored and Intr:lduced the resolu-
lI0ll, ,aid the council chose to take a 
,tanee this time because it agreed with 
rhe pr\)Ce~s of the development of the 
referendum. 

"In the past, the A.S. [Councilj 
hasn't laken offiCIal stands on rcfcren-
dlllm because >ludents have had prob-
lelm with the pruce S, amOunt and 
ll1tcnr of referendums," Dodge said . 
"Thls IS sOlllt'thing that students 
dearly care abollt and needs to pass." 

Last year's fcc re fere ndum to 
Impose a' fee of 71.40 per quarter 
biled. 

According to the resolution, the 
A.s. Council felt the process of crea t-
mg that fcc was disempowering and 
nonrepresenrari\'e of the tudent 
hodv. 

-r'he athl etics fee, if passed, will 
implement a fct: of 28.25 per quarter. 
Some $16.70 of this the fee would go 
to support Intercollegiate athletics, 
which is facing enormous cu tbacks 
with the expiration of the tem porary 
money that funded the o'ansition to 
Divtsion I I athl etics. 

T he rest would be distributed to 
sPOrts clubs and recreation clubs. The 
re olution encourages students to 
vore in support of the ath letics fe e. 

"Be it further resolved, the A.S . 
Council encou rages rhe student body 
to vote yrs on thi s fcc <l nd by doing so, 
invest in the importance of athletics in 
crea tin g,~chool spirit and uni ty on the 
ca mpus, the resoluuon states. 

Commissioner of Athletics Robin 
Shelton headed the task force that 
developed the referendum. 

"The idea behind [the resolution) 
is that everyone wi ll understand the 
importance and significance of the 
referendum," he said . 

Shelton emphasized that the 
process by which the referendum was 
developed is another reason to sup-
POrt it. He ca ll,7d that process "SUl-
dem-organI7.ed. 

Dodge agrced. 
"I 'm really supportive of this refer-

endum because it's one of the first 
times in my knowledge of UCSD his-
tory where students have rrul y initiat-
ed, organized and dcveloped a refer-
endum to provide additional support 
for the un iversity," he said. 

Shelton sa id he believes the mone-
tary suppOrt of :tthl erics is necessary 
for the "gcneral c!UllpUS good." 

Currcntl y, there is no organized 
campaIgn to defeat the referendum, 
and ~tlldcnts are gener:tlly in favor of 
it. 

The resolution was submitted by 
Dodge and reviewed by Shelton and 
Vice Presi dent Internal Jenn Brown. 
It was passed through the internal 
committee and council unanimously, 
according to Dodge. 

"The council passed the resolution 
unanimously, which means that every 
senator, looking out for the best inter-
est of the student body, supports the 
athletics referendum," Dodge said. " I. 
think it's grear to have a council so 
supportive of tim effort and I can onl y 
hope the student body supports this 
effort the same way."

UCSD graduate programs still 
ranks high in newest survey 

UCSD's graduate school programs continued to 
gamer praise from "U.s. News & World Report" in the 
magazine's latest survey of the nation's graduate 
schools. 

The results of the 2002 survey will appear in the 
magazine's April 15 issue and in its annual guidebook, 
"Best Graduate Schools~' 

The Jacobs School of En~neering ranked 14th in 
the nation and eighth among publtc universities. All of 
the englneenng school's individual programs ranked 

among the top 20 in their respective categcries. Jacobs 
is the fastest-rising engineering school in the survey's 
eight-year history. 

The graduate program for political science contin-
ued to receive high rankings. Overall it was ranked sev-
enth, while its specialty in comparative politics wa~ sec-
ond in the country and the American politics specialty 
ranked sixth.

ment of theater and dance maintains its third-place 
ranking.

Sociobiologist E dward Q. Wilson

ByJUN MA 
Staff Writer 

Pulitzer Prize-winning auth or 
and controversia l theorist Edward 
Q. 'Nilson presented a lecture on 
"The Coming Synergism Between 
Science and Humanitie .. to a jam-
packed Mandevi lle Auditorium 
Wednesday evening. 

Mandeville auditOrium, which 
normally seats 785 people, ","as com-
pletely filled for 'Nil on's lecture on 
his dleories of consilience, and many 
onlookers were left standing in the 
aisles. The event attracted UCSD 
students, faculty and members from 
the community. The enormous 
attendance shocked even the spon-
sor of d1e event, Associate Dean of 
the Arts and Humanities and 
Director of the Center for the 
Humanities Georgios 
Anagnostopoulos. 

"I was pleasantly surprised," 
AnagnostOpoulos said. "I've never 
seen Mandevi lle as full as it was that 
everling." 

The event, tided "An evening 
with Edward O. WIlson," was pre-
sented by the UCSD entcr for d1e 
Humanities. 

"The enormous attendance 
indicates the drawing power o f 
'Nilson as a figure of A.'nerican 
science and the extensive interes t 
of thc community on the issues he 
presen ted," AnagnostOpoulos 
said . 

'Nilson first received widespread 
recogni tion in 1975 wi th his book 
"Socinbiology: The New 
Synthesis." In it, he coined the term 

"s(X'iohiolu!,'Y," which look; 'It Lhe

making .md pushing a wnnection

considered absurd. 

'Nilson stres ed, "The greatc,t 
enterprise of the mind has always 
been and always will be the attempt-
ed linkage of the sciences and the 
humanities." 

T his \'iew was well-received bv 
the majority of students in atten'-
dancc. 

"I believe that putting forth a 
view like con ilience is good for Lhe 
exploration of fu rther ;md furun: 
ideas," said Revell e senior Ryan 
Gallagher. "It's mce to hcar a ,den-

Unforrunately, many of Palisoul's 
goals are unattainable - there is no

THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, APRIL 8, 2002 

vp internal • au I lin 

The GlIllHlimz endorses Paul Lin for the position of vice president internal. Because 
p~rt of this job requires rurUling 
A.S . Council meetings and mak-
ing appoinonent~ to various A.S. 
positions, it lIIay seem odd that 
the best candidate has no experi-
ence whatsoever on the A.S. 
Council. 

That notwithstanding, as a 
ca ndidate, Lin has al ready 
demo.lstrated a willingness and 
ability to learn quickly and his 
previous A.S. job was an impres-
sive success. Lin created the A.S. 
Web site, charting territory where 
none had existed, and it is ranked 
among the top three student gov-
ernment sites in the United 
States. Lin brings this technolog-
ica l focus as a breath of fresh air 
into the relatively stale vice presi-
dent internal office; he has vast 
plans for the implcmclkltion of a 
varien' of A.S. infofl1ution online. 

TI~is may seem relatively 
minor, but if properly implement-
ed , it could revolutioni ze the way 

William Tunick, Tom Chapman and Garo BouJ'lloutian are all qual-
ity candidates who bring bright 
and innovative ideas and a hard 
line for followll1g the rules when 
Il comes to spending sUldents' 
money. The Gllfmilllll cndor cs 
'Hulick to serve JS the vice presi-
dent linance on the A.S. Council, 
which annually distributes over 
$1 million of student money. 

Like the other candidates, 
Tunick is opposed to suspending 
council bylaws when dealing with 
funding requests, sometlling fre-
quendy practiced by his fellow 
senators this year. TilJ1ick's past 
actions and proposals would so!id-
i fy and refoml the usc of bylaws. 

Tunick does not waver on 
tough issucs. He has voted against 
c ircumventing bylaws - not 
merely abstaining from the vote, 

A.S . interacts with students and 
organizations on campus. 
Skeptics of the importance of this 
plan need on ly look to 
StudentLink, an adrnillistration-
implemented online to I students 
find invaluable. One of the largest 
problems the A.S. Council has is 
lack of tudcnt interest and mobi-
li7.ation, and in many ways thi 
comes from a lack of transparency 
into snldem government. Lin's 
focus on opening governmem is 
not restricted to electronic efforts 
either; he has clear pbns for 
exp:lnding in-rhe-flesh interac-
tions and openness benveen Stll-
dents A.S. officers. 

There is little rea on to believe 
Lin will not be superbly dedicated 
and committed to this position; 
he is a consummate academic who 
has also been involved with SUI-
dem organizations on campus. 
His list of achievements reads like 
a litany of the academic scholar-
ships available at UC D - no 
small feat, considering his bio-
engineering major - ancl in spite 
of his lack of A.S. experience, his 
range of activities, from 
International HOllse to the 
Biomedical Society, are an 

impressive cross-section of 
UCSD th'lt more than demon-
strates leader<;hip experience. 

Lin 's lack of experience is 
made up for in hi , demonstrated 
drive and intelligellce. For exa/ll-
pie, while runni ng A.S. I1Icet i ng'

Campaigns for positions in sm-

morning when candidates awoke 
to tind posters missing. Instead of 
prominently hanging from loca-
tions across campus, posters 
where found stuffed into trash 
cans.

committee member 
Lincoln Hurlbut. "I

Posters from tile Action and 
Students First lales were removed 
Thursday night, while I ew Wave 
sla te posters remained. The effect-
ed slates repo tered and collected 
evidence on Friday, although no 
complaint has been filed with the 
A.S. elections committee. 

New Wave presidential candi-
date David Hansen denies any 
responsibility. He is not bei ng 
investigated for any wrongdoing 
according to A.S. Elections 
Manager Jessica Williams. 

Indeed, many of 
the students p~esent didn't want 
politica l information - just free 
lunch. 

Earl Warren College sophomore 
Reid Barrett pointed to his slice of 
cheese as the sole reason for his 
attelllbnce. 

Muir junior Johanna Lizaola 
light-heartedly expressed similar 
sentiments. 

"AJI they have is free cheese pizza 
... I need veggies to think about real 
issues," she said.

Williams declared the event a success. 

selves conversing with each other, 
often times across slate lines. 

"This is a great way for candi-
dates to meet each other," said New 
Wave's Muir sophomore cnator 
candiclate Mark SchlJtzel, who was 
talking with opponents Jeremy 
Cogan and David Hughes. 

Williams expected this commu-
n.ication between candidates. 

"In addition to providing SUI-
dents with an intimate environment . 
.. to get to know the candidates bet-
ter, we hope this event also [served] 
to get candidates together," she said. 

"No one on our slate was 
involved," Hansen said." 0 one 
told anyone to do it and we don't 
think it helps anyone in general." 

His competition, however, is 
accusing New Wave members of 
the vandalism. In fact, Hansen, 
along with presidential ca ndidates 
Jenn Brown of Students First and 
Colin Parent of the Action slate, 
drafted a joint statement con-
demning the vandalism and call -
ing for a fai r election. 

"We don 't support whoever 
was responsible for this incident," 
the statement read. "This va ndal-
ism doesn't help any candidate. 
We'd like this election to be as fair 
as possible." 

Phil Palisoul of the Together 
Our Goals Are Achievable slate 
and independent ca ndidate Sam 
Shahmardi also condemned the 
vandalism. 

Shahmardi also reported 
posters missing on Saturday 
morning, but it is unclear whether 

tho~e were taken down by the A.S. 
elections comminee as part of a 
revised posting policy.

posting up: Numerous posters for the Action and Students Filst slates were 
torn down or simply torn to change the message, li ke the one above 

enforced Saturday at 8 a.m. after 
the A.S. elections committee was 
notified by the UCSD Bookstore 
of a complaint from a student 
regarding a falling "San Diego 
Reader" magazine that almost 
struck him. 

UCSD Bookstore Operations 
Manager AJ Lebotski explained, 
"Some students got 'Reader' mag-
azines and wadded them up into a 
log shape and attached them to

the back of campai gn posters with 
duct tape." 

There have been no com-
plaints to the bookstore of anyone 
actually being injured, but there 
have been some close calls, 
Lebotslci said. 

While many candidates and 
students are concerned with 
posters, TOGM has been con-
cerned with the posting of its toga 
on the Sun God. 

The A.S. elections cOllll1littt!c 
i currendy considering whether 
the toga is J viola tion of posting 
policy because it is unclear 
whether thev received permission 
from the Smart Art Collection to 
dress up the Sun God. 

The TOGM slate does not 
feel it has violated posting policy. 

" We nrrned in a receipt to AS 
for the toga and no one batted all 
eye at that," Palisoul said. 
. The A.S. e lections committee 

may rule that the toga must be 
taken down if it feels thJt proper 
permission from the SUlart Art 
Collection was not granted, 
Williams said. 

Marshall college was also con-
cerned with posting policy last 
week when a closed hearing was 
held by the Marshall College 
Council elections committee to 
hear allegations brought agall1sl 
the Marshall Students First Slate 
by Marshall College Election~ 
Manager Doriana Bailey !.lst 
Thur day. 

The slnte was accused of VIO-
lating posting policy because it 
failed to remove onc of sevcral 
posters hung o n halconies that 
violated a new posting policy. 

''It wasn't that we werc trying 
to get free advertising, it was just 
an 'oops we forgot one,''' said 
Marshall Students First candidate 
Billy Ikosipentarhos. 

The Marshall elections com-
mittee fOllnd that Marshall 
Students First had violated policy

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Debate: 
Candidates cheered by 
vocal supporters 
Continued from page 1 
Warren College. "They should 
know the issues off the top of their 
head if someone was to just come up 
and ask them, so why should this 
debate be any different?" 

Nonetheless, the five candidates 
- Jenn Brown of Students First, 
Dave Hansen of New Wave, Phil 
Pali soul of TOGAA, Colin Parent 
of Action, and independent Sam 
Shahmardi - took the stage at 
Price Center Plaza to address the 
crowd that was in the area eating 
lunch. Slate members were in the 
audience, donning colorful slate T-
shirts and wielding noisemakers 
and poster boards. 

Topics presented to the cand i-
dates included the right to freedom 
of speech on campus versus the 
hate-free UCSD Principles of 
Community, funding priorities, 
possible methods to further pro-
mote spirit within the campus com-
munity, the athletics fee referen-
dum, the undergraduate parking 
dilemma, and Housing and Dining 
Services' controversial "one-rate" 
plan. 

Brown used the forum primarily 
to voice her support for student 
organizations. 

"Student organizations are the 
heart and soul of this campus," she 
said . "As president, I will continue 
to fight for these student organiza-
tions at UCSD." 

Brown, who currently serves as 
vice president internal on the A.S. 
Council, suggested that <f Price 
Center expansion via a fee referen-
dum would help add valuable office 
space out of which student organiza-
tions could operate. 

H ansen , who pl ays on the 
UCSD golf team, stressed the 
need to support intercoll egiate 
athletics. 

"Some people say, 'Oh, I don't 
want ath letics [at UCSDJ , it's 
going to ruin the academic integri-
ty, '" Hansen said. "Well have you 
ever hea rd of schools named 
'Stanford' or ' Duke'~ As far as I 
know, they do pretty well in athlet-
ic , and they are pretty good acad-
emic schools too." 

" Big Wave Dave," as his ca m-
paign advertisements read, shared 
his ideas of a Greek hou ing task 
force and a more I1nancially 
accou ntable A.S. Council. 

Palisoul made the debate an 
oppornmity to display his outspoken 
personality and his desire to liven up 
the campus experience at UCSD. 

"What this campus needs is an 
asshole," Palisoul said. "We need 
someone who is willing to fight for 
the students 24-7, day in and day 
out. I am that asshole." 

Palisoul introduced the audi -
ence to "TOGAA's contract with 
the students of UCSD," a list of 10 
actions he promises to carry out if 
elec ted. Among the provisions 
included in the contract are the 
lengthening of Sun God to a three-
day multicultural festival of arts 
and music. PaJisoul is also opposed 
to freshmen resident parking privi-
leges on west campus. 

Parent, who currently serves as 
the A.S. commissioner of services 
and enterprises, introduced a plat-
form that include~ expanding 
Triton Taxi to run from 
Wednesday to Saturday nights, cre-
ating voting spots on A.S. Council 
for "at-large" representatives of 
student organizations, and the 
backing of the impending "antibias 
initiative. " 

·'Our campus is divided.' Those 
are words. Action is doing some-
thing about it," Parent said. One 
solution he mentioned was the cre-
ation of a student summit next fall, 
where members of organizations 
could share ideas among themselves 
as well as with other students. 

Shahmardi, also known as "Sam [ 
Am," embraced the fact that he is 
running for office without the back-
ing of any slate or A.S. Council expe-
rience. 

"The A.S., in my opinion, isn't 
supposed to stand for 'Associated 
Slates'," Shahmardi said, "but 
Associated Students. I, as a student, 
think we need to upgrade this cam-
pus in many ways." 

Shahmardi reiterated through-
out the debate that a good student 
gove rnment needs to represent 
students' needs on an individual 
level. 

"No one should be puni hed just 
because they' re not involved in a stu-
dent organization. Funding should 
be available for everybody." 

By and large, a\l five candidates 
advocated the need for more s up-
port for athletics, both financially 
and in spirit from the campus com-
munity. The candidates al so unani-
mously opposed the implementa-
tion of "one-rate," Housing and 
Dining Services' plan for mandato-
ry uniform Illeal plans for al l 
undergraduate residents.

vp externa I steve k I a ss Finance: 

For the pos iti on of vice pres-i dent exte rnal. there is one candidate who stands above 
the others in terms of experi-
ence and knowledge of the 
office: Steve Klass. 

He is the current national 
affairs director fo r the A.S. 
CO\ln<:i!'s external office and 
has stood our as one of the 
oftlce' most active members . 
Klass has extensive experience 
working with the UC Student 
Association and U.S. Student 
Association, the two major lob-
byi ng bodies to which UCSD 
belongs. He has also had expe-

Internal: 
Erwin would make A.S. 
job listings accessible 
Continued from page 6 
dent sununit at the beginning of the 
year to ga ther opinions and ideas 
from. consti tuents and reforming tlle 
~ppolllbnents process by placing list-
Ings for A.S. positions on 
.\1 nnsterTrak. Regardless of whether 
Erwin is elected, these ideas are sim-
ple and necessary to be implement-
ed . 

The last candidate, Kevin Hsu, is 
also qualified with both snrdent gov-
eTlunent ,md student organization 
experience. Howeve r, his platform 
c~l1ters upon expanding the intern31 
office to "ndvocate" for UCSD snl-
dents in the local commmuty, work-
ing with the extcrnal office more . 
llsu's main background comes from 
orgaluzations dealing with access to 
education for underrepresented 
minorities, and presumably th is 
would become one the issues of the 
intcnal office. T ins is an admirable 
goa l, bllt it is not, and should not, be 
the realm of tlle interna l office; there 
3re a great many on-campus issues 
that require attention and lobbying, 
and external is the place for off-cam-
pus issues. 

Furthermore, the vice president 
internal must be impartial among 
competing snrdent views because he 
lnitigates contlicts between senalOrs 
in and out of A.S. Council meetings. 
When an issue such as affi nnative 
action, which is a traditional focus of 
the external office, does not have a 
snrdent consensus on campus, it 
seems questionable that a candidate 
with a focus from affirmative action 
lobbying organizations on campus 
wishes 10 expand the political lobbv-
ing lOCus of the necessarily impartial 
internal office. 

The two competitive candidates 
are therefore Lin and Erwin. Both 
have demonstrated competence and 
original ideas. While Erwin has a 
clea r lead in experience, her best 
ideas can be .implemented by many, 
while Lrn bnngs an entire range of 
ne,w technologic.1I ideas that bv can 
implement. Furthennore, while Hsu 
and Erwin would be willing to relax 
parliamentary procedure on occa-
ion, Lin 's outsider background is an 

asset because he plans to fairly and 
strictly enforce parliamentary proce-
dure. While Erwin is experienced 
and knowledgeable, ultimately Paul 
Lin is impartial and revolutionary in 
focus, has shown past leadership and 
has demonstrated through academics 
tllat he is driven and accomplished. 

ri ence dealing directly with the 
UC Board of Rege nts and UC 
Ofl1cc of the President. 

In addition to hi s mas ive 
body of experience, Kla ss will 
step \I p the push to get stu-
dents' voices he~lrd on state and 
nali onal levels. He i~ well awa re 
that as students, we have linl e 
levcral!e with elected officia ls 

unl ess~ we improve our dismal 
turnout at v()[ in~ booths. He 
plans to push - for hi .. her 
turnout of UCS D s tudent~ by 
focusing on voter registration 
drives and including voter reg-
istrati on forms in fres hman ori-
entati on materials. He also 
plans to have voter registration 
forms and voter education 
offered at UCSD 's Summer 
Bridge program. 

To lobby Illore effectivel y 
for student interests, Klass 
plans to use partnerships with 
on-campus organizations to get 
more manpower behind impor-
tant student issues. 

Klass has a history of work-
ing with va ri ous student orga-
niza ti ons to lobby elected ofl1-
cia ls, and he plans to try to 
make partnerships with the 
College Democra ts, Student 
Affirmative Action Committee 

Organizations and the College 
Republi cans. 

The main philosophical dif-
fere nce between Klass and 
Sierra Ca tcott, another very 
strong candidate for vice presi-
dent external, is that Catcott 
has more of a focu s on lohbying 
a t the loca l level , as opposed to 
Kla ss' focus on the state and 
national leve l. Though 

3lcon's desire to lobhy for 
cheaper area-housing for stu -
dents is admirable, this is sim-
ply not a rea listic goal. UCSD's 
student government ha very 
li ttl e sway in La Joll a or even 
surrounding communities 
where more students live. 

The only reason UCSD stu-
dents have a strong lobbyi ng 
voice on the state and national 
level is our membership in the 
USSA and UCSA, two well-
funded organiza tions that use 
strength in numbers as their 
leverage, and these are the main 
avenues through which Klass 
plans to advocate student issues 
to elected officials. 

Klass' combination of expe-
rience and clear vision for the 
office make him UCSD's best 
choice for the position of vice 
president external.

finding sponsorsrups, he has emphasized a 
morc detailed and focused system by creal-
ing speCialIzed groups aimed directly at 
soliciting specific types .of sponsorships. 

Another way Grossman wants to bring 
better bands is to team up with other uni-
versities and colleges to gain greater bar-
gaining influence . This wou ld allow 
famous bands to perform at events such a 
Sun God for a lower price. Grossman has 
clearly shown that he knows the event 
planning of not only AS programming, 
but al so other universities. It is his famil-
iariry with the realities of event munage-
menr that sets hIm apart from the other 
candidates. 

StlIdent opinion is another of 
Gros mun's mam concerns. H e wants to 
establish a Web site that would allow for 
stlldent input on band requests. He also 
emphasized the need to expand the diversi -
ry of acts to accommodate stlldents' tastes. 

In addition, rossman wanrs to increase 
tlle reputation of UCSD as a large promot-
er of enrertainment events by increasing not 
only public awareness, but also by promot-
ing events to the local media. 

Though the other candidates also have 
well-planned ideas, they do not match the 
working experience and knowledge that 
Grossman has achieved. T hey also lack a 
realistic or specific approach to the imple -
mentation of their goals. 

However, the GlIardlflll commends 
and gives an honorahle mention to inde-
pendent candidate Jamal Dauda. 
Although just a freshman, Dauda shows 
not only fiery ambition, but also extensive 
knowledge in the areas of mllsic promo-
tion. 0 marter the results of this elec-
tion, Dauda would be a welcome addition 
to the programming office. 

With expertise in the area of pro-
gramming, Grossman has shown that he 
ca n continue the path laid forth by thi 
year's progra mmin g committee, and 
therefore the Guol'dlan endorses

11 FEATURE THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

A group of ex-lawyer 
up to feed S 

Imagine this sce ne: Twenty-flvc UCSD students and (\ man named Jim Stephens are out early on a typical 
Sat\Jrday morning collecting food from local businesses. 
They spend all morning packing it up to distribute to the 
hundreds of homeless people in San Diego. 

Sounds nice, right? Except that it's illegaL 
These UCSD stlldents are actually volunteers for the 

organization called [<ood for Thought. At the heart of 
the organization is Stephens, its founder. Stephens is a 
New York native turned San Diego homeless advocate . 
However, this organization is not what it may seem. 

Food For Thought is not an official nonprofit organi-
zation, and Stephens himself has been arrested for serv-
ing food without a health permit. 

Stephens calls the people preventing him from oper-
ating legally - namely, the city government - "tlat-
worlders." According to Stephens, government officials 
can't understand why businesses will donate food and 
why people volunteer to hand it out when Food for 
Thought lacks any kind of official status. As a result, the 
local government does not feel that it's necessary ro pro-
vide funding for Food for Thought. 

Despite such setbacks, Stephens and the student vol-
unteers continue their mission to help feed the homeless. 
Stephens says his motivation comes from his experiences 
after leaving a job on Wall Street to voluntarily aid the 
homeless for a year. What he found out is that homeless 
people live in constant fear of the police and must deal 
with not knowing where their next meal is going to come 
from. . 

"When I see the homeless, something inside me feels 
brokcn," Stephens said. "I have tried to turn my talents 
toward healing this wound I feel and healing the com-
munity at the same time." 

So, who euctly is this guy? While Stephens appears 
to he just a concerned citizen who enjoys making contri-
butions to the local communIty, his past often overshad-
ows his current persona . I n addition to having a high -
paying job in the business sector, Stephens was once a 
professional runner, a Navy Seals Challenge ehampion 
and a 24 Hour Fitness Triathlon Challenge national 
champion. He has won numerous marathon races in the 

past and profess io nall y 
coaches through his Tri San 
Di ego Multi-Sport Training 
Camps. 

Besides feeding the homeless, 
Stephens continually tries to use his expe-
rience as an athlete to motivate the homeless 
to take control of their lives. In January 1995, 
Stephens sponsored some of these same homeless people 
in the San Diego Marathon and even bought them all 
tennis shoes to use in the event. 

Steve Thompson, one of the race entrants, praised 
Stephens' efforts. 

"Life on the streets is similar to being in a daze, and I 
finally woke up," Thompson said . "There are a lot of 
people out there who will not wake up, but if all the tal-
ent on the street were to wake up, we eould build a city." 

But if Stephens seems like your average wealthy phil-
anthropist, don't be fooled. For all his contributions to 
the communiry, Stephens also possesses somewhat of a 
dark past. 

Years ago, when Stephens left Wall Street, he didn 't 
do so voluntarily. He was fired for stealing from the com-
pany he worked for. 

"Being revealed as a thief among Wall Street attor-
neys was not as disturbing as knowing that my more 
experienced colleagues were getting away with it," 
Stephens said. 

There are also rumors that Stephens has been arrest-
ed several times for drug abuse. So what is the motivation 
for this triathlete and suspected drug user to feed the 
homeless, and what's in it for him ? 

Apparently notlting. Stephens c laims that he is a pseu-
do-educator trying to expose UCSD students to the 
homeless situation to show them what the " real world" is 
like. 

One of the biggest challenges Stephens says he faces 
each day is handing out food in a place that the police 
don't know about. The Planet Hollywood restaurant in 
downtown was a central meeting place to pass out food 
until the business tenants in tha~ area started complain-
ing to the San Diego Police Department about the large

number of 
homeless peo-

pic loitering III 
the area . 

For Stephens, this 
only confirmed his feelings 

abollt tlle city's mission to pre-
vent Food for Thought from competing 

with other local organizations such as St. Vincent de Pauls. 
According to Rivers Morrel, ,I Muir student and 

Food for Thought volullteer, there is a large level of 
uncertainty associated with the organization. 

"We are not really sure where we are going to hand 
out food ," Morrcl said . "The city refuses to issue us a 
health permit because they are so worried that we won't 
be making any money for them." 

As a result, the organization continue to opera te 
underground . Volunteers must make sure they don't 
attract attention when food is being handed out , and 
both the volunteers and those thev feed mu st hear about 
the trips by word of mouth. ' 

Morrel claims that notifying the homeles of the trips 
is not terribly difficult. 

"Almost 80 percent of the sa me homeless people show 
up every time," he said. 

Morrel also said that one of the organization's ma in 
goals is to rei nvent the current homeless program infr:l-
structure beca use of the ineffi ciencies inh ere nt in the 
current system. 

While th e organization continues to assemble volun-
teers, it must do so in an indirect manner. While it is not 
recognized as a nonprofit o rgani zatioll, and is not ofli -
cia lly affi liated with UCSD, Food for Thought continues 
to overcome obstacles to provide for San Diego'S home-
less population . 

"Our goal has been pushed back by hureaucra tic red 
tape," Stephens said . 

The department on urban policy for the city of San 
Diego coul d not be reached for comment.

Thought visit hi ' organization's Web site at

I've taken off my shirt in class right before I 
had to make a speech because I wasn't pre-

Definitely. 

I don't know. Not a whole lot. I like myself. 
If I could duplicate myself, it would be fun 
to hang out with me. 

To get more people to show up at Bible 
study. 

It's reasonable. [ guess if somehody shows

Yeah, but not from school entirely. No, I think people should just be smart enough to 
turn them off. It 's not that hard. 

I wish J had gotten better Graduate 
Requirement Exam scores and studied abroad. 

No homework. 

Find better peace of mind. Get together a surf trip to lahiti . 

I don't fee l like I know enough about it to form 
a good opinion. 

I think that we should offer support for our troops

Women's water polo 
splits weekend games 
Tritons lose to No.6 SJSU, 
easily beat Santa Clara 18-4 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD women 's water 
polo team split last weekend, 
dropping an 8-6 decision to No . 
6 San Jose State University 
before winning an 18-4 laugher 
over Santa Clara University. 
SjSU took control of the game 
from the begin ni ng, forging a 
3-0 lead in the fi rst quarter 
behine! two goals from 
Christine Welsh and one from 
Neva West. 

In the second quarter the 
Tritons reversed the momen-
tum, receiving goals from Meris 
Bantilian ane! Emma Kudritzki 
and holding the Spartans score-
less to narrow SJSU 's lead to 3-
2. 

After the half, the two teams 
continued to play neck and neck, 
as Kudritzki's second goal of the 
day tied the game at three apiece. 
However, the lead didn 't last long 
as the Spartans retook the lead 
behind goals by Welsh and 
Allison Kurvers. 

to die, and Kudritzki's thi rd glxII 
of the ahernoon cut the lead to 7-
6. But SJSU 's Christine Scott 
added another goal with 46 SCt·-
onds left to seal the win for the 
Spartan . 

The next day in Santa Ciar:l, 
Calif., VCSD had no problems 
at all with Santa Clara 
University. 

The Tritons jumped ahead of 
the Broncos 3 -I in the first quar-
ter and never looked back. UCSD 
scored seven unanswered goals in 
the second quarter to take a COI11-
manding 10-1 Icad. 

The Broncos actually played 
even with the Tritons in the third 
quarter, both tea ms scoring two 
goals each to bring the score to 
12-3. 

Elizabeth Keesey contributed 
three fOllrth -quart<::r goals, ;ll1d the 
"lI'itons ended the game with a 6-1 
nl11 to bring the score to 18-4. 
Keesey finished the game wi th ti ve 
goal~, while Kari Lyman, Tucker, 
Samara Silverman and Meris 
Bantilan-Smith all added goals to 
the UCSD offense. UCSD goalie 
Stephanie Lombardo tinished the 
(by with seven saves while her 
Br'onco counterpart, Anne 
Ginotti, tallied tive. " I W,IS just throwing strikes and 

they couldn't hit Ille," Cremidan 
said. 

With the win, Cremidan upped 
his record to an outstanding 6-1. 
Both "~ns Santrday were huge for the 
1 lirollS aher they had dropped two in 
a row, and they improved their over-
all record to 23-13- 1 and 18-9 in the 
CCAA The Tritons si t in second 

Hit this: Triton starting pitcher Andy Hanau pitches to an opponent last SQ.turday. 
Hanau pitched 7.2 strong innings to pick up the win and 10 strikeouts. 

Triton Dana Tucker respond-
ed with a goal of her own, and 
Danielle Boyle scored another 
goal for UCSD in the last minute 
of the thi rei period to knot the 
score at five. 

In the fourth quarter Spanan 
Laura Scott began the scoring 
and gave Sj SU a 6-5 lead. Welsh 
then scored her fourth goal of the 
game and gave the Spartans a 
two-goal advantage. 

After the weekend split. the 
ninth-nlnked Tritons' re(;ord 
evens out to 16-9 as they head 
into the Long Beach Invitational 
next weekend. They then host

oeeer is arguably the most grll-

was waiting for him to have a 
coronary on ti,e basepaths. 

I would nor call Ceci l Fielder 
an athlete. He was a disgrace, and 
whi le ycs, he did hit a lot of home 
runs, I think limiting baseball to 
hitting home runs trivializcs the 
game and its storied history. 

What about the Hall of Fame) 
Should DHs be selected over play-
ers who busted their asses on both 
sides of the field? I don't think so. 

Sure ;\1 "-aline DII"t1 his last 
year to reach j ,000 hits, but the 
majority of his career was as an 
actual position player. 

The most common counter 
argument is that no one wants to see 
a pitcher hit. Admittedly, it's often a 

year's team," Lutton said . "It was 
rea II y a great group of guys, and 
that's what I'm going to mi ss the 
most now that I've graduated. Any 
time you spend that much rime 
with a group of people, YOIl 're 
ei ther going to get reall y ick of 
them, or you're going to become 
reall y close to them, and luckily 
for me, it was the latter of the 
two." 

He added that the one guy who 
has probably influenced him the 
most is teammate Rya n Tondee, 
because "he is a similar player to 
me - hardworking, very dediGH-
ed, rea ll y loves to play." 

VVhen asked abollt hi s greatest 
so(;ce r moment, Lutton ha d to 
pause before roming up with one. 
He sa id it was rough picking une 
moment out of five years on the 
team. 

"If J h'ld to pick one, it would 
probably be Tyler'S goal against 
Ca l Poly Pumona last season in 
overtime. I'd just had surgery on 
my knee and was sitting with the 
tl: .lIll on the bench, When he 
scored that goa l, I almo t blew out 
my kn ee ag~in jumping lip to cele-
brate . Everyone on the hench 
raced OntO the tleld to celebrate, 
and I sprint ed abour three step, 
with them, IUtally forgetting I was 
injured." 

Llllton has battled back fr011l 
sllstaining many injurie, in his Ii,'c 
years, including knec surgery, a 
broken leg, l concussion ;lnd 
cOllil t!ess ankle sprains . Yet, a 

Robin's mark of 150'8" in the ham-
mer throw, which w:tS 10th-best in 
,chool history. 

" \Ne were' prepared to take some 
losses in this one in preparation for 
next week at home af,'3inst lUC 
Riverside], Cal Poly Pomona and 
San iVlarcos and the conference 
championships in May," Salerno 
said. "Sti ll , we generally did not per-
form well . Perhaps a little emotion-
alletdown after the intensity of Cal-
Nevada hampionships last week. " 

The squad fai led to qualify any 
additional athletes for the NCAA 
Division n National 
Championships, bur is still opti -
mistic about having morc athl ctcs 
competing at nationals in late May. 
According to Salerno, Jon Wong 
has come close to qualifying for the 
1,500 meters, which he qualiticd for 
last year and will hOI>efully do so 
again when he peaks. Salerno said 
pole vaulter Mark Gomez is also 
primed tor an NCAA qualification. 

"[Gomez) in the pole v,lUl t wi ll 
be the next one." Sa lerno said. 
"He's do ne 15'6", [fifth best in 
school history] , bur he ca n do 16' 
4". We're just waiti ng for every-
thing to pull together, and he hasn't 
done that yet." 

Despite a lackluster perfor-

painful thing to watch, but true 
baseball fans should love watching 
pitchers hit. Not acwally watching 
them hit, I f,'Uess, but the whole 
strategy that is involved when pitch-
ers have to hit. Coaches have to 
consider pinch-hitting, sacrificing, 
hit-and-nm, doing a double-switch 
- the opportunities are endless. 

Meanwhi le, in the American 
League, a coach would get ~Ierce­
Iy criticized tor having his best 
hitter bunt or hit and run . 

Lastly, consider interleague 
ga mes and the World Series. 
T here's always tile confusion of 
when the pitcher is goi ng to hit, 
when he isn't, and there is no con-
sistency. 

Disbandi ng the designated 
hitter would combat the disturb· 
ing trend in baseball on focusi ng 
on offense, and shift the focus 
more on strategy and multi-
dimensional athletic ability, 
instead of reducing America's pas-
time into a single-faceted game.

hopes to compete well , but more 
importantly, stay healthy heading 
into the fi nal stretch of the season. 

"UC Riverside, a Division I 
school, is dramaticall y improved, 
[and so are) Cal Poly Pomona and 
San Marcos," Sa lerno said. "It's a 
meet we wi ll pursue a little more 
aggressively, but the challenge i to

After the march, Steidllllayer

OK, but not that greatly. He said that 
his team concentrated well , but it was 
mostly an average perfonnance. The 
Tritons won the overall match 6-3

Women's water polo 
splits weekend games 
Tritons lose to No.6 SJSU, 
easily beat Santa Clara 18-4 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Sports Editor 

The UCSJ) women's water 
polo team split la st weekend, 
dropping an 8-6 decision to No. 
6 San jose State University 
before winning an 18-4 lau gher 
over Santa Clara University. 
SJSU took control of the game 
from the beginning, forging a 
3-0 lead in the first quarter 
behind two goals from 
Christine Welsh and one from 
Neva West. 

[n the second quarter the 
Trito ns reversed the momen-
tum, receiving goals from Meris 
Bantilian and Emma Kudritzki 
and holding the Spartans score-
less to narrow SjSU's lead to 3-
2. 

After the half, the two tcams 
continued to play neck and neck, 
as Kudritzki's second goal of the 
day tied the game at three apiece. 
However, the lead didn't last long 
as the Spartans retook the lead 
behind goals by Welsh and 
Allison Kurvers. 

to die, and Kudritzki 's third goal 
of th e afternoon cut the lead to 7-
6 . But Sj U's Chnstinc Scott 
added another goal with 46 sec-
onds left to seal the win tor lhe 
Spartans. 

The ne.~t day in anta Clara, 
Calif., UCSD had no problems 
at all with Sanra Clara 
University. 

The Tritons jumped ahead of 
the Broncos 3-1 in the first quar-
ter and never looked back. UCSD 
scored seven unanswered goals in 
the second quarter to take a com-
manding 10- 1 lead. 

The Bronco actually played 
even with the Tritons in the third 
quarter, both teams scoring two 
goals each ro bring the score to 
12-3. 

E lizabeth Keesey conrribllled 
three fmlnh-quaner goals, and the 
Tritons ended the game with a 0-1 
ru n to bring the score to 1 8-~ . 
Keesey finished the game with five 
goal~, while Kari Lyman, Tucker, 
Samara Silverman and Meris 
Bantilan-Smith all added goals to 
the UCSD offense. UCSD goalie 
Stephanie Lomb:mlo tinished thl;! 
cia y with seven saves while her 
Broncu counterpart, Anne 
Ginotti, tallied five . 

With the win, Cremidan upped 
his rccord to an outstanding 6-1 . 
Both willS Saturday were huge for the 
1 rirons after they had dropped !\VO in 
a row, and they improved their over-
all rL'Cord to 23-13-1 ~lIld 18-9 in the

Hit this: Triton starting p~cher Andy Hanau pitches to an opponent last Saturday. 
Hanau pitched 7.2 strong innings to pick up the win and 10 strikeouts. ' 

Triton Dana Tucker respond-
ed with a goal of her own, and 
Danielle Boyle scored another 
goal for UCSD in the last minute 
of the third period to knot the 
score at five . 

In the fourth quarter Spartan 
Laura Scott began the scoring 
and gave SJSU a 6-5 lead. Welsh 
then scored her fourth goal of the 
game and gave the Spartans a 
two-goal advantage. 

After the week~nd split, the 
ninth-ranked Triton, record 
evens out to 16-9 as they head 
into the Long Beach Invitational 
next weekend . They then host place behind Chico Stlfe University. The Tritons are playing excel-

Triton soccer player heads off 
Senior Jamie Lutton plans to return for MBA 
By ARVIND VASAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

Soccer is arguably the most gru-
eling sporr in the world. Players 
don't have time-outs to regroup 
and they can'r rake water breaks to 
rcju\'cn;'ltc themselves. The players 
don't e\'en have pruper padding, 
ev"n lhough some of the collisions 
th"y take resemble those of foot-
bali. 

Yet overall, senior Jamie Lutton 
wouldn 't trade his soccer experi-
ence at UCSD for :Inything. 

"I've been reall y luck)' to be a 
lIIt!mber of the UCSD men 's soc-
ce r re<lm," Lutton said . "I met my 

~Irlfriend, f./tz:lheth, who pi"),, 
on the women's team and I was 
J ble to watch her win three 
0iarional Championships. I've 
made a lot of really good friends 
and had a 10l of great memories 
from the last five years with this 
realn," 

Lutton ha s succeeded both <lca-
demically ,md athletically in his 
!Ive-yea,: career at UCSD. He ",til 

~rad;,are with a major in psycholo-
;')' and a llIinor in economics, and 
hc plans to relurn to school in a 
few years to obtain " lIbster 's

have been competing exclusively on 
the road for two months. The 
team, still regrouping from injuries, 
hopes to compete well, but more 
importantly, stay heal thy heading 
into the final stretch of the season. 

"UC Riverside, a Divi sion I 
school, is dramatically improved, 
[and so are) Cal Poly Pomona and 
San Marcos," Sa lerno said. "It's a 
meet we will pursue a little more 
aggressively, but the challenge is to 
make sure you [don't] get injured, 
especially for the conference meet."

,\(I~lressed as ,\11 integra l character-
i~tic 01 the sport whose importance 
extends beyond the mere ga me to 
.Ifrect all ~egmcnts of our society. 

They need to get rid of the 
damn designated hitter. 

The designated hitter, estah-
lished in the American League in 
(9 73 in an attempt to boost 
offense, IS a joke. 

I am ~ National League fan . Not 
merely because my home tea m is 
from the 01ational League , but 
hecluse ( can't stand the idea of the 
designated hitter. 

Some Ianlas gets paid $ 10 mil-
lion :\ veal' to sit on the bench, OCCI-
sionally trot up to the plate, swing 
from his heels and try and rut a home 
run, then trot back to the bench until 
his next anempt to smack the crap 
out of the hall. Because that's all des-
ig11:ltcd hitters are re ponsible for -
thev lUSt have to try and hit the hall. 

'~ow, ('m nor ' sayi ng that's an

I (owcller, offense is on ly ball of 
the game. There's also this little 
thing ca ll ed "defense" that's pretty 
key to winning, too. 

Yct the de. ignated hitter doesn 't 
have to worrv, care or learn how to 
play defe nse.' The DH only has to 
play half the ga me - how does that 
conform with the ideals of sports 
alld fair play' 

There are other issues. How ca n 
~ ou compare two p/;Iyers if one has 
more responsihi lites (i.c., has to 
play bUlb offense and defense) than 
the other; 'v\'hat if the DH is a bet-
ter hitter, but the athlete he's being 
compared to is also very strong 
defensively' 

And is someone who only plays 
half a sport even an athlete? Not 
having to play defense excuses DHs 
from a lot of required speed and 
agi lity. Look at Cecil Fielder, the 
former DH for the Detroit Tigers. 
While his ofllcial weight is 261 , at 
some point he swell ed to 300 
pounds and could only hit. He 
practic~lly died every time he was 
forced to chug around the bases,

Baseball regains winning form 
Second-place Tritons slug their way past Sonoma State 
By MATT RYAN 
Contributing Writer 

The UCSD baseball team con-
tinues to prove it is one of the best 
teams in the aliforrua Collegiate 
.\thlctic sociation. After losi ng a 
slugfest to the Sonoma State 
Univer iry Cos aeks in the series 
opener, the Tritons were the only 
ones doing the slugging on Samrday 
when they won both ga mes of a 
doubleheader again t Sonoma State. 

On Friday, both teams Clme our 
sWUl!,ring. The Cossacks iwnped to an 
early lead with five runs in the first 
inning o~f pitcher Keith Smith. The 
Tritons Stolll1ed b-Jck in d1e second 
inning by scoring six runs and knock-
ing out pitcher i\lark Schaukowitch. 
John Bologna was a big part of those 

si.~ nms wid1 a bases-loaded double 
that scored three runners. Boloh'l1a had 
a big game for the Tritons; he went 3-
6 with five RBis and drree runs . 

Mer the ' fi-itons gained an 11 -7 
advant.1ge, Sonoma State scored 
seven runs in the sixth inning and was 
able to hold off d1e Tritons to pre-
serve a 15 -13 victOry.

Follow through: Junior center fielder Matt Smith hits a line drive Saturday against Sonoma State University at Tnton Baseball 
Stadium. The Tritons took two out of three from the Cossacks, and two teams combined for 51 total runs In thlee games. 

The Cossacks h;d a big day from 
several players. They had nine play-
ers with multiple hits, including 
Tom Everidge, who went 3-5 \vith a 
home run and four RBIs. Cossack 

Ian Keen gO[ the win (6-1 ), while 
Bergstrom took a 2 -3 loss. However, 
it was a rough day for both tealns' 
pitching, each combining for a 
whopping 36 hits and 28 nms. 

"It was just one of those freak 

games," said Triton pitcher Alex 
Cremidan. "We have really good 
pitching and they were just hitting 
the ball rea lly well. " 

However, it was a different story 
on Saturday. Triton pitching domi-

nated the Cossack hittt:rs, :\nd 
UC D continued to put n1l1s on d1t' 
board to sweep d1e doubleheader.

Shorthanded track and field struggles in meet 
Women place second, men finish fourth out of five at Point Lorna 
By KEITH DO 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD track and field 
team, coming off a draining per-
formance at last week's California-
Nevada Championships at Fresno 
State University, struggled a bit 
this weekend in a five-wav meet at 
Point Loma Nazarene University 
in San Diego. 

T he Tri tons were shorthanded 
because of injuries, especially on 
the men's side, and the coaching 
staff opted to rest several athletes 
instead of having them compete in 
what was considered one of the 
lower-profile competitions of the 
year. According to head coach 
Tony Salerno, the team looked 
unimpressive. 

"It was a fairly poor showing," 

Salerno said. "We were a little flat, 
actually. This was one of our low-
key meets - the problem was the 
other teams didn't take it as low-
key. They were pretty good this 
year." 

T he women's team, which has 
consi stently put together solid 
showings this year, finished with 
217 points, second to Claremont 
College's 238. Rounding out the 

field was Point Loma, Car State 
San Marcos and the National 
Association of Intercollegiate 
Athletics runner-up Azusa Pad ~i c, 
and Cal State San Marcos . 
Concordia University also com-
peted, but as a nonscoring team. 

UCSD was led by victories in 
three events: Audrey Sung in the
