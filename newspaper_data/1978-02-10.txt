Nader slashes 
corporations 

Levit.tion: "You hop before you fly." This young woman appeara to be in the hopping .tage. 

TM, siddhi lecture this Tuesday 

by Laura A. Richter 
News Editor 

" This is a rare opportunity of 
your lives to explore and to 
challenge," said famed 
consumer advocate Ralph 
Nader a t a noon lectu re 
yesterday in Mandeville 
Auditorium. Nader's address 
emphasized the importance of 
student action in combatting 
corporate control, which he 
says has permeated all aspects 
of American life. 

Suggesting that students take 
advantage of organizations 
such as the California Public 
Interest Research Group 
(Ca lPIRG) and of their 
academic resources in chal-
lenging government injustices, 
Nader felt that the " panty-raid 
syndrome" was to blame for

Off-shore oil drilling 
symposium set tomorrow 

Politicians, professors and 
oil company representatives 
head the list of people 
cheduled to speak at all day 

symposium at UCSD Satur-
day exploring the off-shore oil 
drilling situation in San Diego. 

Sen. Alan Cranston, D-
Calif., and interior secretary 
Cecil Andrus are scheduled to 
address the symposium -
which is being sponsored by 
UCSD Extension, San Diego 
City and County, the Compre-
hensive Planning Organiza-
tion and UCSD Alumni and 
Friends - by satellite 
broadcast. 

The symposium was spark-
ed by the federal govern-
ment's decision to sell drilling 
sites off the San Diego coast. 
The drillilll sites which are 
located approximately 3 to 18 

miles offshore of San Diego, 
have not yet been sold. 

According to Extension 
official Tom Shepard, the 
symposium will start at 9' 00 
Saturday morning in the 
Mandeville Auditorium with 
an historic-al overview of 
national resource manage-
ment by history professor 
Michael Parrish. 

Then at 9: 40, Andrus will 
explain the Carter adminis-
tration's position on Outer 
Continental Shelf oil leasing. 
If Andrus is not able to speak 
because of schedule compli-
cations, an interior undersec-
retary will replace him , 
Shepard said. 

At 10: 10, Cranston will talk 
about the congressiona I 
perspective on off-shore oil

"Ask not what Politjournal 
can do for you, ask what you 
can do for the Politjournal. " 

The Politjournal, according 
to staff member Willard Stone, 
"is a conglomerltion of student 
essays and reports and it sel'ves 
as a vehicle for student 
expression. Despite what the 
name implies , it solicits 
articles not only from political 
science students, but econo-
mics, history and other related 
paper are welcomed also." 

Now in its third year of 
existence at UCSD , the 
Politjournal is eeking to make 
its presence more widely felt on 
campu and to arouse a greater 
degree of interest among 
"slumbering" ocial cience 
student. 

Vehicle for expression 
"At a school which tradition-

ally leans heavily toward the 
natural science , tudents in 

political science, hi tory' and 
related fields often'feel isolated 
and inadequately represented 
in the academic milieu ," said 
staff member Dawn Nagen-
gast. The Politjournal can 
serve as a vehicle for the e 
students to express themselve 
on matters of importance in the 
social science , he said, and it 
can be a most rewarding 
experience to the tudent who e 
paper i published . 

The m mber pointed out 
that any undergraduat . 
student can ubmit an article or 
es ay, even one that he may 
have written for a class. In fact , 
the taff member have poken 
with everal of the faculty and 
a ked th m to encourage 
student with good papers to

administrators failing to heed 
student protest. "They're 
willing to put up with a certain 
amount of circus, because they 
view you as in a perpetual state 
of adolescence." 

Select a legislator 
Nader said he would like to 

see a new college course called 
"the study of institutional 
cruelty." He said that students 
would notify a legislator , 
saying that the course would 
produce a report on his political 
ca reer, including campaign 
co ntribution s and make it 
available to the public. " You 
would immediately become the 
most important group in hi 
career." 

Calling corporate control 
" the most generic form of 
power today," Nader said that 
government is " more of a 
reactor than an initiator," a,'d 
that corporations generally 
can have anything they ask for . 

" The larger a corporation, 
the Ie s likely it is that it will go 
bankrupt ," Nader said , 
explaining that the federal 
government bails them out by 
giving them a huge defense 
contract or by channeling 
money to them by other means, 
which would go unnoticed 
among the billions of dollars 
that are pent by the govern-
ment. He added that income tax 
breaks are also included in the 
corporate po ition in Wa hing-
ton D.C., saying that the 48 
percent rate is often reduced to 
ix percent or Ie s. 
Nader poke specifically 

about corporate busine in 
Delaware a "a revenue device 
to support government opera-
tions ," and said that corporate 
law in that state is so permis-
sive that " General Motor 
could buy Delaware in a 
weekend ... if Dupont i willing 
to sell it. " This instance is an 
example of a situatior. where 
"yo u cannot have political 
democra cy when you have 
corporation who buy up 
politicians and bribe those 
agencie who are suppo ed to 
be regulating them in the fir t 
place. " 

Too much yet too little 
Pointing directly at on-

gre man Bob Wil on (D- an 
Diego), Nader commented that 
Wil on u the logan " too

Tanana's back 

Tom Tanana bas surfaced a,ain. UCSD's most visible 
conservative student II in the news once more, this time with the 
aaaertJon that AS Commissioner of Communications Dave Eisen 
baa d1acrimtnated qaiut his newspaper. the Free Tri&oll. for

space in the Student Center because Tanana failed to provide 
evidence that bia paper met the requirements to ~Ive student· 
funded space.

Students knock CIA ad 
••• Editor: 

I have several comments 
reaardiq your runniq of a CIA 

: ad in Monday's Triton Times. 
I Fir.~t o( all, the fact that the 
I paper staff deemed it el{pedient to accompany the ad with an 

editorial apology belies your I stated principle that " if an ad is 
offensive to a lar,e portion of the i readership it should not be run. " 
In reference to censorship and 
denial o( information to those

Note the lanlU8,e in which proficiency is required: It is no accident 
that the CIA Is interested in Russia , Egypt, Korea and China, baving 
just dusted off most o( Latin America and while still well-entrenched in 
South Africa . What strikes me as most Ironic Is the condescending Dote 
that women and minorities are encoura,ed to apply, two groups of 
people who are the prime target of the CIA's "domestic activity" pal~ 
and present. 

For God 's sake have a little moral courage and go ahead and 
discriminate against such a faclst agency. As for denying those who are 
interested the right to apply don't worry. they'll find an application 
somewhere. It's a disgrace to your presumed intelli,e':lce to run such an

AS Warren objection called immature 
Editor: 

Re: your article of February 3 
co ncerning the AS Council ' s 
objection to the naming of Fourth 
College as Earl Warren College. I 
feel this was an immature and 
childish decision on the part of the 
council and I am disappointed in the 
Council for two reasons. 

First, what right does the AS 
Council have to interfere in the 
naming pro ce dure of Warren 
College? The AS Council should 
represent UCSD as a whole and nOl 
as a special interest group o( 

disgruntled students within one of 
the colleges . If any complaiut is to 
be registered by an official student 
government it should conie from 
the Warren College government 
which is supposedly representative 
o( the sludent population at 
Wa rren. As no complaint has come 
from this quarter (which I know 
of) , it would appear that a majority 
of Warren students are not deeply 
disturbed or upset with their new 
name. And if the Warren students 
aren't dissatisfied, why should the 
AS Council be? 

In 48 hours you can learn to use 
your mind to do anything you 
wish. It has been said that Einstein us-ed only 10% of his mind. and the 
general public uses only about 3% or 4%. And that's what Silva Mind Control 
is all about: learning to use more of your mind. There is no limit to how far you 
can' go: there is no limit to what you can do, because there is no limit to the 
power of your mind. Students report si mple things like learning to stop 
smokIng. to fall asleep without drugs and wake up without clocks, to relieve 
nervou ness. to stop excessive drinking. to memorize long lists and to improve 
creallvity to the more sophisticated things like learning to develop ESP and 
to use dreams to solve problems and to get Information. 

Over 1.000.000 people all over the world have taken Silva Mind Control. and 

I respect Ms . Zavala 's right to 
object to Warren 's name being used 
because of his involement with the 
internment of Japanese-Americans 
during World War II, but at the 
same time I feel it is important to 
point out that Ms. Zavala is a 
student at Third College and the 
naming of Warren College does not 
affect her or her college. The AS 
Council'S attempt at " solidarity" 
with discontented Warren students 
seems to reflect their own personal 
prejudices against the name rather 
than a majority o( Warren students' 
opinions. i 

This leads me to the second 
reason I am disappointed in the 
council - their obvious lack of 
objectivity which they have 
displayed in this matter . The 
naming of Warren College was a 
difficult task for the naming 
committee. They had to observe 
various rules and regulations which 
the Regents impose in choosing a 
name and they spent nearly a year 
s ifting through piles of names 
before they decided on one that 
would both satisfy the Regents and 
at the same time reflect the 
philosophy and character of the 
college . Did the AS Council 
rationally consider all these points 

atuDta were the counter-Cinco de Mayo demonstration - with 
DOn-UFW ,rapes aDd lettuce - and a referendum campaien 
a,aiDJt mandatory student activity fees. 

As befits the status of the rigbt in student politics here, students 
supported the mandatory fee by a wide mal'lin. A group of UFW· 
supporters converged on Tanana's counter-celebration and 

I trashed bis DOn-union salad. 
Since then, Tanana baa feuded with his old ,roup, Young 

Americans for Freedom, and formed his own newspaper, the Free 
Tri..... The journal bas been most notable for its irregular 
publisbing scbedule - Dine time. in about three yeara - ita heavy, 
bookatock paper and one ridiculous article comparing Cesar 
Chavez to Adolf Hitler. The Free TriIOD baa, however. provided an 
alternative to the objectivity of the Triton Times and the 
sometimes·drearily predictable radical sentiments of other 
campus journals. 

Now. though, Tanana has been denied space in the Student 
Center. Eisen says he has set three requirements for campus 
media to receive student funding or space: proof that the journal 
needs the funding and that most of its workers are students; that it 
prints a disclaimer in its staff box saying it is published by UCSD 
students; and that it offers material of interest to students. 
Tanana doesn't meet the first two requirements. Eisen says. 

Tanana feels the denial was politically motivated. and points to 
space allocations and funding for many leftist student 
organizations. Yet while his claims about the other groups may 
have some validity , his assertion about Eisen' s political 
motivations are way out of line. Eisen is a conservative 
Republican. While he may not be as far to the right as Tanana, he is 
hardly in alignment with the left. 

Eisen seems to be right in this controversy . Tanana knows the 
rules and could easily comply with them. Eisen says if Tanana 
does comply with the rules, he will allocate the Free Triton some 

s~ace . . 
Though Tanana may be wrong in this limited controversy, he 

does raise several good points in the course of arguing his case. 
One of the things Eisen doesn't like about Tanana's space request 
is that Tanana refuses to reveal who works for his paper. and 
which local businessmen contribute money to its operation. While 
it's not readily apparent why association with a rightist journal 
would hurt businessmen in San Diego. Tanana unfortunately does 
have good reason to abide by his fellow-workers' requests not to 
reveal their names. Some of the Free Triton workers could well 
face academic retribution, depending on their majors. 

This problem is a sign of the times, of the political intolerance of 
some students, faculty, administrators a nd groups here. It's 
amazing. sad and true that some people here have no tolerance for 
opinions that differ from theirs . While most people here are 
probably reasonably tolerant. the most active and intensely 
involved people often refuse to accept the fact that their word is not 
necessarily gospel truth. 

This fact is always obvious to those of us who work on the Triton 
Times, which has always striven to present both sides of issues so 
its readers can make up their own minds. A good example of this 
was the 1976 disciplinary hearings for ten UCSD students charged 
with harrassment of uC President David Saxon. While we 
editorially supported the students. we tried in our news pages to 
objectively present the events to our readers. For this, we w..,-e 
castigated up one side and down the other. by students who felt we 
s hould have presented only the "correct " line - theirs . 

so can you. To lind out how. we 
invite you to a free seminar. But a 
word of caution: it ",ill change your 
life.

that I have heard is that it doesn't

Coach Ted Yamaguchi feels that' 'if we had a full team we could 
have beaten Fullerton." Due to injuries two players were unable to 
compete. 

The team went on to defeat CSU Northridge in the second round 
of consolation matches, 6-3 , winning five of six singles matches. 
The number one doubles team was also victorious . 

The outlook for the rest of the season, according to Yamaguchi , 
is good . "We' ll probably have a winning season. It will be 
depending on how much we can improve in comparison to the 
other teams in our bracket. " 

The team will get a second shot at CSU Fullerton this Saturday 
at 2 pm on the Muir Courts .

The TI-52 The super slide-rule that'll 
. get you into programming ... fast and easy. 

Even if )'Ou've never programme~ before. 
For the student who re-

quires slide-rule functions, the 
TI-57 delivers an exceptional 
com bination of advanced 
mathematical and statistical 
capabilities. From functions 
such &8 trig,logs. powers, roots 
and reeiprocals ; .. to mean, var-
iance: standard deviation and 
much more. 

And as long as you're in 
the market for a super slide-
rule calculator, why not buy 
onethatcan also put the power, 
speed and convenience of pro-
gramming at your disposal? 

Programming a calculator 

simply means giving it a logical 
set of instructions for accom-
plishing what you want it to 
do. Programming enables you 
to solve lengthy and repetitive 
problems 
quickly 
by sub-
stituting 
new vari-
ables into 
the set of 
instructions 
which you 
have al-
ready entered into the machine. 

-The end result is more effi-

cient use of your time in prob-
lem-sol ving. 

All this and more is ex-
plained in our unique. illus-
trated, easy· to-follow guide-
book, "Making Tracks Into 
Programming." This ZOO· page 
book comes with the TI-57. It 
contains simple, step-by-step 
instructions and examples to 
help you quickly learn to use 
programming functions to 
make your pro blem -solving 
faster, mot;e accurate and fun.

honors program. The senior 
theses are usually condensed to 
a length of 15 to 20 pages. 

The journal was founded in 
the spring of 1976 by Garret 
Gruner, who is now a second 
year graduate student at UC 
Berkeley. The two previous 
publications have had their 
techni<;al and financial 
difficulties, but were small 
successes overall. This year the 
staff says that they hope to have

Levitation .•• 
(CoBdaued from Pale 1) 

The basis for the siddbls lies in the transcendental consciousness 
and its nature. "The transcendental consciousness is the 
fundamental field of life," said Adelson, "It's like a sea of 
undifferentiated putty, the basic unmanifest stuff that contains all 
possibilities. " 

The concept in sub-atomic physics of a vacuum state relies on a 
similar notion of a basic, underlying field that contains the 
potential for the entire pheonmenal world. The existence and form 
of the elementary particles are movements of the field, places 
where the field has become more dense. 

A number of people on both physics and the TM movement have 
been willing to equate the transcendental consciousness with the 
vacuum state and in essence say that both groups of explorers 
(physicists and meditators) are inquiring into the same basis of 
the world. . 

Physiological cbanges ]37 Pearl - 459-0711 buted by the end <>( Spring 
~ .. ;' .. ~ ............ ~ .. ';~~~~~~~~~~. quarter. The physiological changes the body undergoes during meditation have been measured in numerous studies. If the 

human nervous system is seen as the machinery of consciousness, 
measurements of the state of the nervous system can reflect the 
state of consciousness.

Screening 
The 15 current staff members 

(six of whom were at the 
meeting) are organized into 
four committees to read and 
screen submitted articles. 
Then the articles pass through 
a final screening and editing by 

, a newly-selected group of four, 
after which they go to the press . 

Said staff member Roger 
Cohen, "We anticipate the 
growth of our journal and hope 
it becomes a major publication 
on campus which will reflect 
the academic values and 
standards of UCSD .. . and 
perhaps it will help offset the 
image of UCSD as a science-
oriented school. " 

Brain coherence, the degree of correlation of EEG recordings 
from different parts of the brain, has been seen to increase during 
meditation. Higher degrees of brain wave coherence are seen as 
indicative of a more integrated nervous system. Other measures, 
such as levels of plasma cortisol as a reflection of stress and 
metabolic rate have shown positive changes. 

Another effect referred to by meditators is the Maharishi effect, 
named in honor of the founder of the TM movement. According to 
Adelson, the effect is that if one percent of a community's 
population is meditating, the entire community will benefit in 
terms of increased quality of life. A study measured the crime rate 
in eleven cities with one percent of the population meditating and 
found that each city 's crime rate had shown a significant reduction 
as compared to eleven control cities. 

In explaining this Adelson said. "The fact of the mater is world 
consciousness is growing. Maharishi envisions a time when 
anyone and everyone could lead thisjtighly developed life. It is the 
Age of Enlightenment. "
