Chancellor Richard Atkinson 
issued his endorsement of a cross-
cultural center on campus last 
Friday, mirroring recent decisions 
by the UC Board of Regents to 
bolster minority recruitment, re-
tention and graduation programs 
across the UC system. 

"I find myself in agreement 
with the general proposal to es-
tablish such a center," he added. 

The chancellor's letter further 
explained that the task force's 
report would be forwarded to the 
Academic Senate for review, 
"with the intentofmovingquickly 
to implement the ... recommen-
dations." 

The Santa Barbara center cur-
rently has an annual budget of 
approximately $156,000, which 
covers the costs of staff salaries, 
work-study programs, student 
support staff and programming 
expenses. 

Despite the chancellor's official 
show of support for a cross-cultural 
center, several members of the task 
force are skeptical of his endorse-
ment. 

Task Force Chair and History Pro-
fessor David Gutierrez said, "The 
chancelloragrees in principle that the 
establishment of a center is a good 
idea ... but his letter in all honesty 
was very general and vague." 

Atkinson replied to the rec-
ommendations of the Cross-Cul-

Costs and a funding mecha-
nism for the proposed center have 
yet to be determined, although 

The task force also suggested 
the creation of a "steering or over-
sight committee" to implement 
and develop the !ecommenda-
tions made to the chancellor, con-
sisting of representatives from the

Violent Crime Low at UCSD 
REPORT: UC Police study is 
consistent with nationwide 
campus crime figures 
By .... Freund 
Senior sr." Writer 

The nine Univenity of California cam-
puses are mucb safer than the state and the 
nation as a whole, according to an annual 
crime report conducted by the UC Police 
Department. 

The report shows that the rate of violent 
crimea on UC campuses last year was ap-
proximately 72 incidents per 100,000 indi-
viduals. The fipre is dramatically lower tban 
tbe 1992 California rate of 1,104 and the U.S. 
rate of 758 incidents per 100,000 individuals. 
The corrapondina 1993 state and national 
fip ... are not yet avail_Ie. 

uCSan Dieao Police Detective DouaOdeIl 
said tbe report 8CCUrately reflectl tbe hi'" 
level of IeCUrity on campus. 

.. Aa COIIIpMeCI to .tbe city and the Itate in 

general, I feel the campus is absolutely safer," 
Odell said. "VVe [UCSD] have a small land 
area but a dense population, so you get a 
quicker response time compared to San Diego, 
where you have a much larger land area to 
patrol." 

Crime reports from colleges and univeni-
ties around the country echoed similar find-
ings. Ueutenant Dave Nelson of the Univer-
sity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign said he 
agreed that the more concentrated, smaller 
populations at most univenities make them 
easier to monitor. 

The report also shows that in 1993 the UC-
wide number of agravated assaults (113) was 
up21 percent and the number of robberies (66) 
increased by 25 percent over the previous year. 

However, at UCSD, the number of violent 
crimes reported in 1993 was lower than the UC 
avera •. A total of 200 violent crimea were 
reported on otber UC campuses last year, but 
only five lUCIa incidents were reported at UCSD.

Advises

To Ax ,P.E. 
DECISION: Representative 
Assembly votes to approve 
senate's recommendation 
By Iven Delventhal 
Staff Writer 

The Representative Assembly of the Aca-
demic Senate voted 33 to 15 Tuesday to 
approve the Academic Senate Council'srec-
ommendation to shut down the UCSD Physi-
cal Education Department. 

The assembly, which consists of elected 
representatives of the Academic Senate, re-
ported its decision to Chancellor Atkinson, 
who will in tum decide whether to recom-
mend disestablishing the department to UC 
President Jack Peltason. 

Under the current proposal for 
disestablishment, courses now offered 
through the P .E. Department would be trans-
ferred to the Office of Student Affairs. Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Joseph Watson 
said that he is confident the Recreation De-
partment could adequately meet student 
needs. 

"If the P.E. Department is disestablished, 
we are prepared to assume the responsibil-
ity," VVatson said. He added that Student 
Affain is investigating the feasibility of of-
fering the recreation classes on a "pay-to-
play" basis. Under the proposed program, 
classes would cost around $25 and instruc-
ton would be paid between $8 and $]0 per 
hour. 

Mike Vandergriend of the P.E. Depart-
ment said the problem with the pay-tOoplay 
configuration is that instructors would have 
no allegiance to UCSD. . 

~Students will be paying more and get-
ting less quality," Vandergriend said. 

Chancellor Richard Atkinson conceded 
that situation is u.nfortunate. 

"It'. sad we are having to go in this 
direction," Atkinson said, "but these are de-

UCSD to Exhibit Virtual Shopping 
UCSD and the san Die&O Supercomputer center 

have developed a three-dImenSional, virtual reality 
system to allow consumers to experience mall shop-
ping in the convenience of their own homes. 

The system, called "In the Baa," enables shoppers 
to navigate a lifelike representation of a shoppine 
mall. They can wander through the mall, enter stores 
and even make purchases. 

Interactln& with the system is made possible with a 
cyberglove and a spaceball. The spaceball provides 
movement and rotation, while the glove tracks the 
position and orientation of the shopper's hand. 

Selections are made by pointing and takln& hold of 
the desired merchandise and then dropping It Into a 
computerienerated shopping bee. The shopper is 
able to see three-dimensional space and merchandise 
through Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) shutter glasses. 

The system will be showcased at SIGGRAPH '94, a 
conference held at the Orange County Convention 
Center In Orlando, Fl, from July 24-29.

Scrtpps Scientist Proposes 
Volcanic MHot Spots" Theory 

A Scripps Institution of Oceanography scientist has 
proposed a theory that could explain why some volca-
nic activity, like that In Hawaii, produces entire Islands 
while similar activity In areas like Yellowstone National 
Park produces relatively small phenomena such as 
geysers. 

Associate Professor Jason Phlpps-Morgan of the 
Institute for Geophysics and Planetary Physics at 
Scripps, along with Geophysics Professor at Princeton 
University Jason Morgan. hypothesize that a barrier of 
prevIously-melted rock Is prewntlnc upweHlngs of 
macma from deep within the Earth In certain locations. 

According to the scientists, these upwellings, or 
"hot spots," occur more readily In areas like HawaII 
because fast-movinC tectonic plates In these loca-
tions move the old melted material fIlWSty before they 
can build up. 

In other volcanic areas, like cape Verde and the 
canary Islands, the piates move more slowly and the 
material collects, reducln& the deIree of volcanic 
activity at the earth's surface.

To'.fll Meeting Focuses on Cheap Housing 
FORUM: Students 
discuss advantages of 00-
campus co-op housing 
By Judith A. Wlldlrhorn 
Msoclate News Editor 

Students demanding affordable 
on-campus housing left the fourth 
floor of Blake Hall last night, end-
ing their week-long occupation, to 
hold a forum to discuss their pro-
posals with students, faculty and 
staff. 

The forum was aimed at publi-
cizing thecurrenton-campus hous-
ing situation and discussing pro-
posals for housing ·alternatives. 
Coalition members also cited fee 
increases and insufficient finan-
cial aid as important issues. 

At the meeting, coalition mem-
bers proposed the creation of an 
on-campus housing cooperative 
that, according to Revelle sopho-
more Jenny Pascwalk, would give 
students administrative autonomy 
and eliminate the costs of using 
Housing and Dining Services and 
hiring resident advisOrs. "A co-op 
would inspire students to be re-
sponsible for themselves. Students 
could take control of their own 
lives," Pascwalk said. 

Pointing to bousing co-ops at 
otber UC campuses, sbe added, "I 
think that we have some good 
examples to follow." 

However, Pasewalk said she 
believes the monthly cost ofhous-
ing would be approximately $250, 
considerably more than the A.S. 
estimate of$17S. 

Although the coalition has yet 
to work out the details of housing

- Jenny P8MweIk 
Revelle sophomore 

eligibility, Warren senior Mat-
thew Danielczyk said that prior-
ity would be given to low-income 
students. "(flow-income students 
fill up the co-op and bigh-income 
students can't get in, then that's 
just tbe reality." 

Several faculty and staff mem-
bers who attended the meeting 
were supportive of the coalition's 

goals but were critical of its tac-
tics. "[Your) chances are much 
better if you work with the system 
than if you try to overpower it.," 
said Muir College Dean Charles 
Dreilinger. 

"No state money goes into hous-
ing, so it is really complicated," 
said Revelle College Provost Tho-
mas Bond. He added that other 
issues involved in establishing a 
co-op include deciding whether or 
not to be associated with the uni-
versity, hiring an accountant and a 
grounds keeper and establishing 
policies on alcohol. "People who 
want a co-op need to decide 
whether they want to deal with the 
other ki nds of issues out there," he 
said. 

On Monday, coalition mem-
bers met with Director of Housing 
and Dining Services Larry Barrett, 
urging him to support their pro-
posals. According to Danielczyk, 
Barrett agreed that a co-op would 
be the most workable solution for 
affordable housing, but pointed to 
several obstacles that prevented 
him from promising that the co-op 
would be created. "(Barrett] agreed 
to start meeting with us weekly to 
try to work out a solution," 
Danielczyk said.

Task Force Report 
Postive Step For Center 

After two months o( investigation and debate, Chancellor 
Atkinson 's Task Force on the Cross-Cultural Center Proposal re-
leased its recommendations last week for a multicultural center at 
UCSD. While the task force 's recommendations are relatively 
broad, with details unspecified in some areas and omitted in others, 
they clearly affmn the core ideas of the Cross-Cultural Center 
Coalition's initial proposal. 

The task force recommends the creation of a multicultural center 
for (1) recruiting and retaining underrepresented students and (2) 
fa tering a better "campus climate" for these s tudents. To meet these 
goals, the cross-cultural center would provide a broad array of 
resources and services, including a number of academic support and 
community and student outreach programs to complement and 
expand upon existing programs. The center would also house art 
exhibits, serve as a venue for various musical and cultural events and 
provide a space for lectures and seminars. In addition, the task force 
called on the chancellor to step up efforts to expand afflfIDative 
action programs and recruit more "minority" faculty and staff 
members. 

In reference to the center's "govemingstructure," one of the most 
controversial aspects of the proposal, the task force recommended 
the establishment of a steering committee, under the auspices of the 
chancellor, which would include student, faculty and staff represen-
tatives. In addition, the task force wrote that the "size and composi-
tion of the... steering committee should be detennined by the 
functions the cross-cultural center would serve .... " Given the pur-
pose and goals of the center, the steering committee would be similar 
in composition to that outlined in the coalition's proposal, with 
representatives from organizations such as Student Affirmative 
Action Committee (SAAq, MEOlA, Native-American Student 
Alliance (NASA) and African-American Student Union (AASU). 
The report also mentioned the Graduate Student Associatioo (GSA) 
and "relative administrative offices" under vice chancc:lIolS for 
Academic Affairs, Undergraduate AffaiIS and Business Affairs. 

Many have criticized the coalition's proposal as "exclusionary" 
because not all cultures and ethnicities are equally represented -
especially in the steering committee. This charge is largely a red 
herring, and is based on a very different conception ofacross-culturaJ 
center than that outlined by the coalition. Rather than a tool to make 
college education more accessible for underrepresented ethnic "mi-
norities" and promote ethnic pluralism at UCSD, opponents envision 
a center which would serve simply or primarily as a place for 
celebrating and sharing between all cultures. While this is an 
extremely important goal - and something that both the initial 
proposal and the task force strongly emphasize and outline - we 
should not allow it to obscure or detract from issues of 
underrcpresentation and educational aa:ess. The current coalition! 
task force proposal for a UCSD cross-cuIturai center places issues of 
"minority" recruibnent and retention at the center and balances this 
goal with efforts to improve race and ethnic ~latioos OIl campus. 

Ot~nor Atkinson bas voia:d his support of the task force's 
general recommendations and said that its report has queUed his 
concern that the center would isolate students of colors and broaden 
racial divisions. While the task force's report is only a fust step (the 
proposal needs to be reviewed by the Academic SeDate) and many 
specifics still need to be worked out (most prominently, bow the 
center will be financed), it is encouraging that the administration is 
finally, after a long line of similar proposals, taking the idea of a 
multicultural center seriously. We commend the effort. 

Thumbs Up to the Blake 
HaIl Occupi~1'8 ••• 

.. .for forcing the issue of affordable housing back on the table. 
While the coalition's methods may be a little silly, and while it could 
have set a more solid agenda before beginning its protest, affordable 
housing is a worthy issue. Housing on campus is currently obscenely 
expensive, part of the reason we are one of the most expensive public

FOUR YEARS DOWN 
COMMENTARY: Since the class of '94 got to UCSD, the school has ceased to 
be up-and-coming, but have we improved, .or are we slipping? 
By ErIc Schmidt 
Senior Staff Writer 

When I first arrived at this school in the fall of 1990, 
Newsweek consistently ranked UCSD the number-<lne 
up-and-coming school in the nation. This campus was 
already good, but there was a feeling it could be better, 
even ranked among the greats in the world. My classmates 
and I had the chance to help take it to the top. 

So where are we now, four years later? We are no 
longer an up-and-comer, but have we made the big time, 
or are we sliding downward? 

Looking at the state of the University of California, it 
would seem we're spiraling into a public education hell. 
Fees have more than doubled since 

the last four yeus, I've followed these trends more than 
most students would probably care to. Granted, UCSD 
can be duller than a Saturday night spent at a retirement 
home, but sometimes a good story pops up. The following 
is a brief account of some of the major issues the campus 
has seen since October, 1990. 

• A first-rate univelSity will have first-rate events, both 
for culture/education and entertainment There ue more 
cultural events on this campus than you can shake a stick 
at, which is nice, but students need more good entertain-
ment 

Four years ago, students could go to rock concerts on 
campus and pick up glasses of free beer. Needless to say,

ers to go around for undergraduates, it just takes some 
digging. I've had professors who could make any concept 
easy and interesting, and some who compete for my 
attention with the ticking of the seconds hand on my 
watch. 

• Race relations. I first saw racial bittef1lClS on this 
campus over three years ago, when I covered a story about 
fliers which had been tom down because they were 
allegedly racist. The flielS were a conservative at1ack on 
racial quotas supposedly used in accepting students.

Tbunday, May 26, 1994 The UCSD Guardian OPINION 5 

COMMENTARY: In the United States, children of interracial parents are not categorized as ''biracial,'' reflecting both their black 
. and white heritage, but simply as ''black.'' Such binary thinking on race is detrimental to improved racial relations. 

8y Orecory Stephens 
Contributln, Opinion Writer 

On April 1, my wife Valeria and I 
witnessed the arrival of our first chi Id, 
Sela Alana. In addition to bringing the 
usual joys and trials of parenthood, 
Sela's birth also dramatized for us 
how addicted our society is to think-
ing in black and white. 

As partners of African and Irish 
descent, we are among over two mil-
lion Americans in interracial mu-
riages. Seta is among tens of milliolL'l 
of AmericalL'l with "mixed blood." 
Yet we quickly discovered that our 
society has not carved out a space in 
which such children can affirm both 
sides of their heritage. 

The Alta Bates Hospital birth forms 
had boxes for the "race" of the par-
ents, but oone forthechild.1batwould 
be designated, we were told, in a 
Sacramento offICe. And the policy is 
that as long as one parent is consid-
ered"black, " no matter how minimal 
the actual African UJCeStry, those re-
spolL'lible for categorizing people by 
race will put that baby in the "black" 
box. 

The structure of these boxes can be 
revealing. I picked up a California 
State University application and saw 
15 different boxes for vuious Asian 
ethnicities, and six for Latinos. Then 
there was black and white. Friends 
assured me that this system had its 
advantages. As a "student of color," 
Sela would be eligible for many race-
based scholarships. When we voiced 

our determination to raise her as a 
"biracial" child who did not fit into 
one category or the other, we were 
advised oot to kick a gift horse in the 
mouth. 

Currently, Ethnic Studies and 
multicultural education is dominated 
by a model which must fit all "mi-
norities" into four groups: Asian! 
black/Latino/Native. The miIIionsof 
"mixed race" children are presenting 
a largely unmet chaUenge to trace our 
mutually<reatedculture in inclusive 
ways. 

As Dr. Francis WardleoftheCen-
ter for the Study of Biracial Children 
notes, "People involved in the politics 
of race delight in creating two oppo-
site camps: white people and people 
of color .... clearly [many) multiracial 
children belongineach camp." Wardle 
believes that recognizing biracial chi 1-
dren "implies these two groups don't 
have to hate each other." 

A glance at Latinos shows just 
how shaky it is to base coalitions on 
skin color. Hispanics, who are ex-
pected to constitute 37 percent of 
California's high school students by 
2006, range from white to black. 
Viewed inclusively, they iUustratethat 
language and culture are more bind-
ing than skin color. MultiraciaIpeople, 
whether "Latino" or biracial or other-
wise defined, can be part of the equa-
tion in a muliculturalism, as outlined 
by Angela Davis, "in which white 
people are neither centered nor ex-
c�uded."

emotions were sincere, with students 
on the Hump crying, shouting, calmly 
analyzing the events in Los Angeles 
and racism in society. Eveniually, the 
protests devolved, and idiotic student 
"revolutionaries" smashed Price Cen-
ter windows and a reporter's tripod. 
Many students were sincere through-
out the hubbub, but when the protest-
ers stormed down to block the 1-5 for 
more thlln an hour, it seemed most 
students were just there for the excite-
ment of it an, sort of a '60s revisited. 

All the action detracted from the 
real emotion evinced after the eve of 
LA. rioting. Never were races more 
unified, never more divided, on this 
campus than on that night. Some stu-
dents worked together, no matterwhat 
the race. But students around campus

distrust of blacks, whites, Koreans 
and others. TheturmoilquicIdycleared

African-American Student Union af-
ter the Nation of Islam appeared on 
campus. Many of the problems have 
worked themselves out, but tensions 
still exist at UCSD. Perhaps most 
troubling is the fad that certain fac-
tions used these racial tensions as 
political firepower to support their 
favorite candidates in the recent As-
sociated Students elections. 

That racism exists to such a degree 
in 1994ononeoftherremierintellec-
tual campuses in the oountry is unac-
ceptable. The only response to this 
problem has been the scheduling of 
more forums and the creation of more 
committees. I would hope that a par-

better way to deal with race tension.

kicked students out of the General Store

CENTER: 
Endorsement gets 
mixed reviews 
ContIIIued from ..... 1. 
representative to the task force 
Poncho Gue~ara said, "U's fasci-
nating to see that the chancellor's 
special tuk force has given it a 
unanimous endorsement. ... 
We're hopeful but cautious." 

Guevan said hewasconcemed 
that the implementation of the 
task force's recommendations 
would be stalled during the Aca-, 
demic Senate's review. 

A.S. President Carla Tesak 
said sile disagrees with several 
details of the task force's recom-
mendation. 

"The actual proPosal I can en-
dorse, but the appendicies I re-
ally can't," Tesak said. "For ex-
ample, in one letter to the chan-
cellor [tas'k force members] make 
a statement ... that it has been 
proven that underrepresented stu-
dents learn in a different way ... 
and I have real problems with 
that." 

Tesak added that she believes

violent crime rate," Odell said. 
"Obviously, one violent crime is 
one violent crime too many, but 
the largest percentage of crimes at 
UCSD is property crimes." 

Crime reports at other univer-
sities around the country also 
showed that violent crimes are 
much less prevalent on campus 
than property crimes. 

At the University of Washing-
ton in Seattle, Sergeant Bob White 
noied, "Our violent crime is down 
40 percent from what we were 
seeing20yeanl ago. Property crime 
is up fractionally over the past few 
years, but crimes against persons 
are down." 

And at San Diego State Uni-
versity, wbere several fraternities 
have recently fought with outsid-
ers and each other, Police Agent 
Steve aine says that aside from 
these isolated incidenta, violent 

the taak force's recommendations 
are still vague and ambiguous. 
but they are much more inclusive 
of non-minority groupa tban the 
Cross-Cultural Center 
Coalition's original proposal, 
which she said, "completely ne-
glected their existence." 

According to the recommen-
dations of the taskforce, the cross-
cultural center's mission is to 
"meet the special needs of stu-
dents from underrepresented 
groups by providing program-
ming space and staff support for 
intellectual, cultural and social 
activities in a welcoming and 
comfortable environment." 

Also included in the center's 
mission is the intent to develop 
and present cultunl programs that 
"promote understanding and ap-
preciaiion of social and cultural 
diversity" and to provide a set-
ting which "promotes increased 
cross-cultural interaction and 
communication." 

The task force also suggested 
an increase in the university's af-
firmativeaction measures and that 
the cross-cultunl center serve as 
a site for community outreach, 

The UCSD Cuardi .. 

particularl y for southern San Di-
ego County and Imperial County. 

According to Patrick 
Velasquez, Coordinator of the 
OASIS Summer Bridge Pro-
gram, "Students from commu-
nities of color don't have a sense 
of ownership of this institution 
to the same extent that the up-
per-c1aas La Jolla community 
does. 

"One of the major goals is to 
try to get more community 
groups, including students and 
professionals and people of all 
walks of life, to be on this cam-
pus more often and take a greater 
interest in what we're doing," 
Velasquez added. 

Atkinson's approval is con-
sistent with last week 's decision 
by the Board of Regents to invest 
$1 million in long-term recruit-
ment, retention and graduation 
programs for minority students 
systemwide. 

The moves are intended to 
help boost minority enrollment 
in higher educational institutions 
to reflect California's increas-

tion. 

Property Crime crimea are rare on

According to Cline, motor ve-

DAVID MAMET writes with a vul-gar, full-fisted 
Hemingway swagger that 
terrorizes the effete and in-
timidates the polite . 

Mamet doesn't do a 
minuet around his subject 
matter; he stages bull-
fights. He doesn't choose 
a political party and lobby 
for its merits, he picks a 
political system and rips 
open its heart, challenging 
his audience to look as the 
blood spurts and poo s. ' 

B y J 0 h n 

It's a gruesome thing, 
yes. Perhaps even a male 
thing. But David Mamet's 
dramaturgy is nothing if 

. not exhilarating. The Old 
Globe Theatre is currently 
presenting Mamet's latest 
play, "Oleanna," a thun-
dering work that takes on 
the still-scorching topic of 
sexual harassment. 

In the play, Marnet de-
picts a seemingly-innocu-
ous office meeting be-
tween Carol (Kathleen 
Dennehy), a befuddled fe-

male college student, and 
John (Bill Anton), her 
slightly-too-pedantic male 
professor. 

When Carol repeatedly 
complains that she can't 
understand what her pro-
fessor is saying, John 
breaks the teacher-student 
relationship and tries to 
communicate with her in a 
less formal, more-intimate 
fashion. 
. John moves from behind 

his desk and affects a

OLEANNA: 
Mamet asks 
audience to side 
with accused male 
ContInued from ..... H1 
casual posture. He taps Carol on 
the shoulder to make a point. After 
she breaks down in frustration, he 
consoles her with a hug. In other 
words, he offers the kind of emo-
tional support any compassionate 
human would provide to help out a 
person in need, interacting with 
Carol with the kind of familiarity 
professors are consistentl y warned 
not to use with thei r students. 

And then Carol nails him for it, 
bringing forth accusations of sexual 
harassment that threaten both 
John 's marriage and career. 

Much to the dismay of sensitive 
people everywhere, Mamet's 
"Oleanna" asks the audience to side 
with the accused male rather than 
the accusing female. And we do. 

In the staging, it becomes very 
clear that John did not sexually 
assault Carol, and yet from a legal 
standpoint, her case against him is 
quite strong. Mamet uses this play 
to lash out at our litigious, censori-
ous environment in which legali-
ties supersede basic human de-
cency. 

Director Jack O'Brien deserves 
credit for looking toward the larger 
issues of communication in the play 
rather than focusing exclusively 
on the surface-level sexual poli-
tics. O'Brien rightly establishes a 
quick tempo for the piece- Marnet 
plays always charge hard - and 
seamlessly brings John and Carol 
to the brink of truly connecting 
with one another to illustrate how 
and why they tragically miss. 

Anton and Dennehy are remark-
able as the two combatants. Anton, 
a lecturer in UCSD's Theatre De-
partment, plays the college profes-
sor with just enough condescen-
sion and distraction to merit his 
adversary's chagrin. 

Dennehy's Carol is the more 
difficult role, yet she pulls off the 
transition from (narrow-minded) 
bumbling oaf to (narrow-minded) 
litigious nitpicker with a convinc-
ing, appropriately infuriating per-
formance . 

In Acts II and III, Dennehy deftly 
portrays an individual who doesn't 
speak for herself but rather for a

cause; her compassionless tone 
brought shriekaof anger and aston-
ishment from the opening-night 
audience. 

These reactions, along with the 
countless heated discussions in 
which theater-goersengaged on the 
way to their cars, are a big part of 
why "Oleanna" is a major play. 
Mamet is a highly-skilled rabble-
rouser, a smart, visceral populist 
who writes for a community to 
which he also belongs. He doesn ' t 
spew smug, self-satisfied intellec-
tual meri ngue, and he never conde-
scends to his audience. 

But what exactly is Mamet say-
ing to his audience with this play? 
Is he trying to convince us that men 
are always right and women al-
ways wrong when accusations of 
sexual harassment are presented? 
Is Mamet trying to pull the rug out 
from under the women 's move-
ment? Is he a misogynist? 

Of course not. And anyone who 
thinks Marnet is capable of such 
narrow, hateful thought should visit 
a library and consult "Glengarry 
Glen Ross," "Speed the Plow," 
"Edmond, " or anyone of bis otber 
published worka. Mamet is an ex-
traordinarily moral writer, and be 
writes witb an epic scope tbat tran-
scends party lines, CSPAN and 
yesterday's headlines. 

Mamet's greatest asset as a dra-
matist is tbat he isn't afraid of of-
fending those with delicate sensi-
bilities in order to stir up contro-
versy. 

He could bave written 
"Oleanna" with a female professor 
wrongly accused by a male stu-
dent, but he probably figured that 
would only comfort and appease 
the mostly educated, mostly up-
per-class, mostly liberal audiences 
who see his work. 

Instead, Marnet puts himself on 
the line. With "Oleanna" he has 
crafted a dangerous argument in 
order to make a courageous obser-
vation about our times. 

Mamet should be applauded, the 
Old Globe Theatre should be com-
mended and you should attend. Go 
with a good conversationalist and 
be prepared to have it out after the 
final curtain. 

"Oleanna" runs through June 
26 at the Old Globe Theatre in 
Balboa Park. For more informa-
tion on tickets and performance

Saxophonist Joshua Redman's 
fame hasn't diminished since he 
skyrocketed to fame two years ago. 
His 1992 debut album gained wide 
critical praise, and his follow-up 
album Wish was met with equal 
enthusiasm. On Wish, Redman 
worked with jazz greats such as 
bassist Charlie Haden, drummer 
Billy Higgins and guitarist Pat 
Metheny - quite a feat for a new-
comer. Redman, who graduated 
summa cum laude from Harvard 
and was accepted to Yale Law 
School, won the Thelonius Monk 
International Jazz Saxophone 
Competition in 1991. He has not 
slowed down since. With a new 
album due out in August, Redman 
will perform both old and new 
songs when he plays on Sunday at 
8 p.m. in Mandeville Auditorium 
with the Joshua Redman Quartet. 
Guardian: How have you 
dea,t with your sudden 
fame? 

Redman : I'm lucky enough to 
be able to make a decent living 
playing jazz music, which is a 
hard thing to do. There are a great 
many talented jazz musicians who 
haven ' t been able to do that be-
cause they haven ' t been in the 
right place at the right time. The 
way I deal with it is to not really 
think about it. I have gigs, but J 
don ' t pay attention to how many 
records I sell. I have to [think 
about it] on a business level, but 
on an artistic level, I try to keep all 
that separate. To keep the music 
pure, you have to think only oft~e 
music. I appreciate the fact that 
people have responded positively 
to me, but I am my own worst 
critic. Most of the time I walk off 
the stage thinking I played terri-
bly. I can't stand to hear myself 

play music. I love to play music, 
but I can't stand to hear myself 
play music. That may be a little 
extreme, and I'm trying to work 
on not being so negative, but I 
think it is important to have a 
healthy dose of self-criticism. 
How did you balance Ka-
demics and music? 

I didn't really balance them. It 
was either one or the other. During 
the school year, itwas only school, 
and I hardly played music at all. 
During the summer - rather than 
getting a typical summer job at a 
law firm or working an office job 
- I played music. That wasn't 
much of a balance. Music was a 
second or third priority . In many 
ways, I feel like a novice. Al-
though I've been playingthesaxo-
phone since I was in fifth grade, 
I've really only been playingseri-

ously for the past two-and-a-half 
years. 
So .. you comfortable play. 
inc with veter .. malelans 
such as C ........ H .... n? 

Initially, it's very scary. You 
walk into a room or into a record-
ing studio with people whom you 
idolize and who are so far ahead of 
you in their musical vision . But I 
found that the greatest artists who 
have the most to offer musically , 
tend to be the most humble per-
sonally. They make you feel wel-
come. Part of being a great musi-
cian isn't just being astonishing. 
It's also knowing how to blend in 
with what's happening and how to 
make music with whomever you 
are playing. When I had the 
oppportunity to play with people 
like Charlie, Billy Higgins and Pat 

Me~heny, they made me feel wei· 

come even though I WIS below 
their level. The greatest musicians 
are often the greatest people. In-
timidated IS I might fecI walking 
into a studio, once the music starts, 
all that intimidation and fear dis-
appears. 
What Is the ....... of Jazz? 
Do JOU ... yoIfteIf coa-
laboratlns with hlp-hop 
musician.? 

I have done a couple things like 
that. I played on Me'shell 
N'dgecello'salbum. That's one of 
the most exciting things I've done. 
I've actually played live with hera 
couple of times too. I also just 
recently played on a cut on a Big 
Daddy Kane album. I'm com· 
pletely into it. It [hip-hop] is part 
of the future of music. I don't 
think it is the be-all and end-all. 
Some people act as if it is the new 
jazz and there won't be any jazt 
except that. I don't feel that way. I 
feel both jazz and hip·hop are 
strong, viable art forms in their 
own right. Jazz doesn't need hip-
hop any more than hip-hop needs 
jazz, but there's a tremendous po-
tential for fusion between the two 
genres, and I'd like to be a part of 
it. I think there are many currents 
of jazz that will continue into the 
future. 
Jazz .... often reflected the 
aocIaI .......... xperienced 
by African Americans In the 
United States. Does your 
music have a ........ sodal 
or poiltlcai upeel? 

My music comes from myself 
and the souls of the people playing 
the music. Of course, political , 
economic and social conditions 
influence the way you are. I think 
those kinds of issues can and will 
be reflected in the music. But I 
don't consider my music political 
because I don't have an explicit 

political or social message I'm try. 
ing to get across. For me, one of 
the beauties of music is that it 
transcends the material or the lit-
eral realm. Music hIS ita own 
meaning which is strictly musical 
and that's part of the joy of it for 
me. Maybe five years from now I 
will be writinglOciai protest songs. 
I'm not saying that is not a valid 
thing or something that doesn't 
interest me. Righi now, I don't 
consider my music explicitly po-
litical. I think you can find that 
[politics] in different parts of my 
music. I think music ultimately is 
an emotional thing. 
Ha. )uz lost Its potential 
for social chance now that 
conc..t audiences .. c0m-
posed .... 1nIy of white, up-
per-clus patrons? 

I think it has the potential for 
that [social change]. Jazz at this 
point is definitely not connected 
to street culture - ·at least not at 
the level that it was in the past, 
although that's debatable. I've 
never studied the sociological de· 
terminants of jazz. I think jazz has 
the capability to be a voice for the 
people, but I don't think it has to 
be political. Ultimately, what's 
important is that jazz is a voice for 
whoever is playing it. 

Whoever's making music -
their personality should be ex-
pressed through the music. That's 
true of all the greatest jazz musi-
cians. You can say that bee-bop 
was protest music and make a case 
for it, but the thing that made 
Charlie Parker great was that he 
had this direct connection to his 
soul, and he was able to communi- . 
cate that. As long as the soul and 
spirit is present, the music will 
have power and validity whether 
or not it speaks for a group of 
people.

way. 

-It takes real mental preparation 
to ad over' the JIel'VOUSneu for Na-
tionals: said Monahan. -You can't 
be meataUy unfOCUleCl and expect 
to do well." 

Tho dominant pair in the field 
oyents this year has been the cow-
boy hat-wieldin, duo of Marc 
Sleenhof and Randy Buehler. 
Sleeaihof; a two-year UCSD vet-
eran, qualified ill the discus, while 
Buehler, another lolli-time Triton 
1taDdout. qualified in the hammer-
throw event. 

Roundilll out the Triton field 
team is sophomore Tara Monaghan, 
who Qptured an NCAA berth in the 
women'l hammer throw. 

Wodneaday'l preliminary events 
put the UCSD -elite lix· in excel-
lent position for the finals, to be held 
on Friday and Saturday. 

Although tbu~rms rolled 
throuah the Qmpus of host North 
Central College early in the after-
noon,. the Triton athletes were still 
able to squeeze in some remarkable 
performances. 

Monahan proved to be the high-
light on the women's side, setting 
yet another personal record with a 
spectacular time of 1:03.66 in the 
4OO-meter hurdles. Her time eamed 
her a seventh-placo finish in the

preliminary racea. 
Since the top eipt atbIeteI in 

each event qualify for All-Ameri-
c:an status, Monahan baa already 
earned that honor. Her final placing 
In the oyent will be dctcrminod in 
the championship race on Friday. 

Sleenbof also had an exceptional 
day, hurling the hammer over 148 
feet (148'2"). Thilmerited him an 
eighth-place finiah, a trip to the fi-
nals on Saturday, and ensured him 
of All-American status. 

Sleonhorl "field duo" partner, 
Buebler, bad a disappointing outing 
011 Wednesday. He fouled out and 
failed to qualify for Saturday'l fi-
nals. 

Castner, expected to be a serious 
contender for a medal, raced last 
night in a late final. Both of 
Shepard's, u well u Monapan's, 
preliminary events will be held on 
Friday. 

"The favorite to talce home the 
top-team honors has to be the Uni-
versityofWiIoonsin-Laaosse," said 
Salerno. 

While Salerno hu talcen UCSD 
athletes to National. all of bi, seven 
years coaching at the school, he 
laments that this you's group is 
smaUer . 

"I can't complain about the fact 
that we've sent fe~er athletes this 
year," Salerno said. "We still have 
more people here than most Divi-
sion III schools, and we're still very 
young."

TX,last weekend to compete at Na· 
tionals. 

in Saturday's road race competi· 
tion, Dave Edwards wu the only 
member of the men's squad to finish 
with the lead pack, placing 15th. 
Esther Davis raced to a 20th-place 
finish in the women's competition. 

The Tritons caught an unlucky 
break in Sunday's five·rider, 17-
mile team time trial, when they drew 
the second-to·laststart time and were 
forced to battle strong winds as the 
competition wore on.

In the final event, the 3S·mile

turned in UCSD's best performance 
of the weekend, once again pacing 
the women's squad with a fifth·

Three UCSDskiers participated in the 21-skier west·

Triton Alison Walmsley met with the mOlt success of 
the UCSD skiers, grabbing eighth for the second year in 
a row in the trick event with 820 points. The junior also 
was a surprise in the slalom event, skiing within two 
buoys of her personal best to take seventh place. 

Walmsley's performance helped the western women 
finish only 20 points behind the third-place south central 
region. 

Tritons Dave Sasse and Bill Berk also made the trip. 
Sasse competed in both the slalom and trick events,

What is the world coming

Capriati is posing for mugshots 
that would make Andre the 
Giant look like the prom 
queen; upcoming NBA first-
round draft pick Jason Kidd is

performing his best impression 
of track star Carl Lewis; and 
the Haitians are juicing our 
beloved baseballs with ancient 
voodoo flying powder in a 
vicious plot to overthrow the 
major league baseball commis-
sioner. 

And just when you think 
you 've reached the end of your 
tether, when it seems you 've 
seen the worst of it all, in come 
the Toronto Raptors. Now is it 
just me, or is that the stupidest 
damn name ever recorded in 
the history of professional 
sports? 

Sure, it 's a fine title if 
you ' re playing in the ever-
popular sandbox leagues with 
the rest of the three-year-olds, 
but for one of the fastest

the world, get real.

Sf"" Writer 

Call them the "young guns" or the "sophomore 
sensations" - either way the six Triton tracksters 
that qualified for the NCAA Division IU National 

Head Coach Tony Salerno. 

Championship, held in 
Naperville, IL, make 
up one of the young-
est squads assembled 
in UCSD's history. 

"I guess the thing 
that really separates 
this group [of qualifi-
ers] from previous 
years' groups is that 
most of them will be 
back next year," said 

Fittingly, freshman phenom Lisa Shepard will 
lead the way for this upstart group of Triton athletes. 
Having qualified in two events, the triple jump and 
the tOO-meter hurdles, the local Orange Glen High 
School grad will be essential in the final team point-
total tally. 

Another star youngster competing for the Tri-
tons is 10,OOO-meter specialist J.J. Castner. A con-
sistent performer throughout the year, he will draw 
extensively on his experience at Nationals last year. 
Salerno calls him the "long-distance stud" of the 
men's squad. 

The third member of this youthful mix is the 
vibrant sophomore hurdler Michaela Monaban. She 
grabbed an NCAA-qualifying mark in the 400-
meter hurdles by setting numerous personal records 
"p.r.s" - as well as several school records along the 

See NCAA, Page 11 The truly scary part is that it 
took Toronto almost six 
months to put together the 
insidiously creative moniker 
and logo. Somebody should 
give the mascot designer a 
swift kick in the butt. 

UCSD Faces Carthage in World Series Opener 
Mr. Brilliance, or Ms. (let's 

not be sexist when we dole out 
the inevitable mockings), 
draws a picture of a doped-up 
Barney, admittedly one of the 
lamest-looking dinosaurs to 
never walk the planet, and then 
paints the damn thing purple. 

PRIMmME: Tritons (31-6) open 1994 Division III Baseball World Series against Carthage, Wisconsin (30-13) 

Hasn 't the world had 
enough of Barney? I mean 
have you ever seen a real-life 
purple dinosaur? For that 
matter, have you ever seen a 
dinosaur? Nope, I didn ' t think 
so. There's a reason for that: 
they ' re dead, extinct, kaput, 
don't let the door hit you in the 
butt on the way out. 

AA far as raptors go, had 
anyone actually heard of this 
di nosaur before J IUtLSS;C Parle 
came out? Of course not. I bet 
Steven Spielberg is relaxing in 
his palatial estate and chor-
tling all the way to the bank 
over how he fooled the NBA.

National Championships In Naperville, IL 

the Tritons advance into the finals, 
the Championship Game will be 
played May 31. Although neither 
team knows much about the other, 
there are a few things the Tritons 
can expect from Carthage. 

The Redmen are expected to stan 
right-hander Ryan Taylor (8-3, 1.38 
ERA). In 91.3 innings of work this 
year, Taylor has struck out 101 bat-
ters and leads the Redmen in saves 
(3). He has an above-average 
fastball, but his "out pitch" is a split-
fingered fastball, something the Tri-
tons baven'tseen muchofthis year. 

The Triton pitching staff, on the 
other hand, may undergo several 
major changes. Ryan Flanagan will 
take the mound against Carthage, 
but after that, Head Coach Lyle 
Y atea' rotation is in doubt. 

Man:: Abrams, coming off his 
best outing of the year, may repIIce 
Mark Hartmann, who stru"'ecI 
against Cal Lutheran in the Wat 

Regionals. Steve Height is also ex-
pected to see action. 

They will have their work cut out 
for them competing against John 
Zuleger (.389, t4 HR, 58 RBI) and 
Mark Beyer (.408, 58 RBI), who 
bave shouldered the offensive load 
for Carthage this season. 

The Tritons' offense will need to 
continue to do the thinga that earned 
them wins in the final three games 
of the West Regionala. Eric Quandt 
will have to get on any way he can, 
and Chria Miyake ... to continue
