Edward A. Frieman, the former 
director of the Scripps Institution 
of Oceanography, passed away of a 
respiratory illness on Thursday April 
11, 2013 at UCSD Thornton Hospital. 
Frieman was 87 years old and the 
eighth appointed director of Scripps.

Frieman graduated from 
Columbia 
University at 
the age of 20 
on the U.S. 
Navy V-12 
program where 
he trained as 
a diver and 
participated in 
and observed 
the Bikini Atoll 
atomic bomb 
tests. 

He went on to obtain his Ph.D. 
in physics from the Polytechnic 
Institute of Brooklyn, later becoming 
one of the first scientists recruited 
to work on Project Matterhorn at 
Princeton University.

“Ed Frieman had a remarkable 
scientific life,” Director of Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography Charles 
Kennel said. “I was privileged to be 
his, I believe, second Ph.D. student.”

Prior to his UCSD career, 
Frieman worked as the executive vice 
president and group manager for 
Science Applications International 
Corporation in La Jolla. 

In 1988, Frieman became direc-
tor of the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography and vice chancellor of 
marine sciences at UCSD. 

“He was quiet, apparently unas-
suming, seemingly happy just to be 
accepted by the big egos that domi-
nate science,” Kennel said. “But Ed 
worked differently, confidentially, 
one-on-one, and it was there that the 
strength of his mind, his clear eyed 
realism and the force of his will really 
came through.”

While at UCSD, Frieman also 
served as a research professor of 
physics at the Cecil H. and Ida M. 
Green Institute of Geophysics and 
Planetary Physics at Scripps.

“Ed, thoroughly familiar with 
both the government and science, 
recognized that science, and particu-
larly ocean science, was bound to 
change as the end of the Cold War 
neared,” Kennel said. “He positioned 
Scripps to be the one of the world’s 
leaders in this field while maintain-
ing Scripps’ close relationship with 
the Navy.”

Transportation Services held its fourth transportation town hall meeting on Monday, April 15, 2013. The meeting took place in the Moores Cancer Center and 
was intended to give medical center staff and faculty an oppor-
tunity to provide feedback to TPS. In January, TPS announced 
that changes to its services would need to occur in order to 
close a $2.1 million budget deficit.

Earlier this February, several other town hall meetings 
including an undergraduate town hall lead to the indefinite 
postponement of cuts to shuttles and increases in parking 
costs. During that time, TPS continued to collect input from 
the campus community andby holding town hall meetings 

“The need to address the budget deficit has not changed,” 
Director of Auxiliary Business Services Robert Holden said. 
“We have been able to get additional ideas and input from 
students, staff and faculty. We are taking the input into consid-
eration as we redesign the proposed changes.”

However, according to Adam Powers, former A.S. 
undergraduate representative to the Transportation Policy 
Committee, service cuts and fee hikes are undeniably in the 
horizon.

“As far as I know, there are no solutions to the TPS bud-

UCDC Students Attend Q&A with High Court Justice
uC  system

WASHINGTON, D.C. – United 
States Supreme Court Justice Antonin 
Scalia told over 200 University of 
California students on Monday that 
judges should not make moral judg-
ments, but instead interpret what the 

founders intended when they wrote 
the Constitution. 

The justice’s comment at the 
University of California Washington 
Center was made after a number of 
students asked him about his con-
servative opinion on minority rights. 
Scalia — who is currently the longest 
serving justice on the nation’s highest 
court — told students that the found-
ers were clear about protecting polit-
ical and religious minorities,  and it 
was the court’s role to expand upon 
their intentions. 

“There are all sorts of minorities 
out there,” Scalia said. “What about 
child abusers? Now, are they to have 

special protections? I don’t think it’s 
up to judges to prowl about in titling 
other minorities to special privileges 
to an exception from the general rule 
of democracy.”

Scalia spent most of his time 
explaining his judicial philosophy 
called “originalism,” which means 
interpreting law according to the 
context in how it was written.

“You don’t read Shakespeare in 
the language of today,” he said. “You 
use a glossary to understand what he 
meant at that time.”

He went on to discredit the 
notion that the Constitution should 
be adapted for modern interpretation. 

“But somehow for the 
Constitution, we governed with the 
notion ‘Oh, the Constitution chang-
es,’” he said. “It changes to reflect 
the evolving standards of decency 
of a maturing society. That’s rather 
Pollyannish.”

Scalia entertained the audience 
throughout the night with anecdotes 
about his job.

“Sometimes I ask questions 
because I’m bored,” he said of his 
inquiries during hearings. “I ask 
them to stay awake.” 

UCSD junior Ariel Teshuva asked 

TPS held its fourth transportation town hall meeting to 
gather input before implementing changes to address debt. 

Scalia commented that 
judges should refrain from 
moral judgements when 
addressing minority rights.

Edward A. Frieman, the 
eighth appointed director 
of Scripps, passed away 
last Thursday at UCSD.

UCSD engineers have invent-
ed a “nanosponge” that can safely 
remove a broad range of danger-
ous toxins from the bloodstream. 
The nanosponges absorb various 
“pore-forming toxins,” regardless of 
molecular structure, and neutralize 
them by destroying cells by punc-
turing the cell membranes.

This toxin-independent treat-
ment would allow doctors and hos-
pitals to carry out one general treat-
ment rather than multiple toxin-
specific treatments.

“This is a new way to remove 
toxins from the bloodstream,” 
Liangfang Zhang, a nanoengineer-
ing professor at the UCSD Jacobs 
School of Engineering, said in a 
press release on April 14. “Instead 
of creating specific treatments for 
individual toxins, we are develop-
ing a platform that can neutralize 
toxins caused by a wide range of 
pathogens.”

In a lab study conducted on mice 
with MRSA (methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus), a strain of 

antibiotic resistant bacterium, 89 
percent of the mice pre-injected with 
“nanosponges” survived lethal doses 
while those post-injectionedinject-
ed resulted in a 44 percent survival 
rate. MRSA is responsible for many 
infections in humans that are dif-
ficult to treat.

The “nanosponges” are wrapped 
in red blood cell membranes to 
avoid being attacked by the immune 
system. Liangfang Zhang and his 
lab at UCSD created this red blood 
cell cloaking technology by expand-
ing on their previous research that 
demonstrated that nanoparticles 
disguised as red blood cells could 
safely travel in the bloodstream.

The team used a centrifuge to 
separate red blood cells from a 
blood sample. The cells were then 
placed in a solution causing them 
to swell and burst, releasing hemo-
globin and leaving the skin behind 
which is then mixed with the ball-
shaped nanoparticles.

A “nanosponge” has a diameter 
of approximately 85 nano-meters — 
3000 times smaller than a red blood 
cell, allowing thousands of “nano-

sponges” to be created from one red 
blood cell membrane.

Using the cloaking technology, 
“nanosponges” protect red blood 
cells by diverting harmful agents 
from the vital cells and absorbing 
the toxins. The liver incurred no 
noticeable damages after metabo-
lizing both the “nanosponges” and 
collected toxins.

Test-tube experiments demon-
strated that the number of toxins 
each “nanosponge” could absorb 
was dependent on the toxin. 
Numbers ranged from 85 mono-
mers for alpha-haemolysin toxin 
produced by MRSA to 850 mono-
mers of melittin, the active compo-
nent of bee venom.

The researchers are now work-
ing to apply their work to create 
approved therapies. Researcher 
“Jack” Che-Ming Hu said one of the 
first applications would be an anti-
virulence treatment for MRSA. Hu 
earned his Ph.D. in bioengineering 
from UCSD in 2011. The team says 
that the next step is to conduct clini-
cal trials.

Zhang and his team of engineers 

at the Jacobs School of Engineering 
published their findings in Nature 
Nanotechnology on April 14 and 
will present part of their work on 
April 18 at Research Expo, the 
annual graduate student research 
and networking event for the engi-
neering department.

get deficit that would not require 
either cutting services or raising fees,” 
Powers said. “Since TPS is charged 
with being self-sustaining, those are 
the only two options.”

Additionally, Powers advo-
cates TPS, UCSD and San Diego 
Association of Governments 
involvement to pressure San Diego 
Metropolitan Transit System for rea-
sonable prices and favorable terms 

of service.
“This crisis has reared its head 

a few times ... I strongly urge every 
student to stay informed on the issue 
and contact your TPC representa-
tives to ensure your voice gets heard,” 
Powers said.

Meanwhile, transportation con-
tinues to be a dominant issue with 
the newly elected student body rep-
resentatives of A.S. Council.

“There are many different efforts 
going on,” A.S. President-elect Andy 

Buselt said. “Presently, I’m looking at 
the bike and pedestrian master plan. 
I’ve already started language on ana-
lyzing the bike system on campus.”

Another town hall meeting is 
scheduled for the Hillcrest location of 
the medical center on April 18. The 
schedule for the next undergraduate 
town hall meeting has not yet been 
determined.

In 1994, Frieman was elected a 
member of the American Association 
for the Advancement of Science. In 
honor of his 70th birthday, his family 
established the Edward A. Frieman 
Prize for Excellence in graduate stu-
dent research at Scripps. 

The Frieman Prize annually rec-
ognizes Scripps graduate students for 
their scientific work.

He retired as director of Scripps 

and UCSD vice chancellor of marine 
sciences in 1996, returning to his 
office at SAIC.

“He was a thoughtful leader and 
a very kind man,” Director of Scripps 
Communications Cindy Clark said.

Frieman is survived by his wife, 
Joy, sons Michael, Josh and Jonathan, 
and daughters Wendy and Linda as 
well as six grandchildren and a great-
granddaughter.

A public memorial for Frieman 
will be held at Scripps. The date has 

not yet been determined.
“I suppose one could say they do 

not make them like that anymore, 
and it is true,” Kennel said. “The 
country has changed, the Cold War 
is over, and physicists are no longer 
the dominant figures they once were. 
Ed was one of the few to navigate the 
transition to the global world we now 
live in.”

Yes, it’s the Aleksandra substi-
tute again. But never fear, the A.S. 
Council columnist extraordinaire 
will be back very soon.

Following end-of-the-term goof-
ing off — council did not reach 
quorum until late into the evening 
— this week’s meeting essentially 
became a heated debate surrounding 
the impending 
UCSD smoke-free 
policy.

Public input 
lasted a glorious 
two minutes, and 
after a quick pre-
sentation by The Zone to advertise 
its Good Life Festival, I realized that 
I might be able to go back in time to 
eat at a dining hall.

However, my hopes ended with 
the beginning of a Smoke-Free 
UCSD presentation by 
AVP Environmental 
and Social Justice 
Vanessa Garcia 
and Assistant Vice 
Chancellor for Student 
Wellness Karen Calfas, 
which sparked input 
from almost every 
single councilmember 
present.

I have to say 
that I rather enjoyed seeing coun-
cil unite in agreement that the 
UCOP-mandated smoke-free policy 
was unfair and not transparent. 
Members, including Bryan Casella 
and Garcia, were especially con-
cerned with repercussions for the 
General Store, which is the only 
institution on campus that sells 
tobacco-related products.

With the implementation of the 
smoke-free policy on Sept. 1, the 
General Store would lose approxi-
mately $100,000 in revenue from 

tobacco-related sales, according to 
representatives from the store.

“I really think that it’s up to us to 
really reach out to our constituents 
to make up for this loss of revenue 
that will occur to [the General 
Store],” Garcia said. “We need to 
really support them through this 
change.”

Many of the 
policy disagree-
ments were direct-
ed toward Calfas 
and included 
objections to the 
lack of knowledge 

about the policy until very recently 
as well as concerns about discrimi-
nation against international students, 
for whom smoking may hold a 
cultural aspect. MVP speaker of the 
night was Social Sciences Senator 

Emma Berdugo, who 
vehemently rallied 
against the policy and 
may have been a little 
too harsh on poor 
Calfas.

After reaching 
quorum, council 
redirected to reports 
of committees, pass-
ing a resolution about 
AVP resolutions and 

then tabling a campaign finance 
rule resolution regarding mandatory 
spending limits after approximately 
45 minutes of discussion.

Then, as happens often when a 
group of people thinks too much, 
council engaged in a short, random 
outburst, not unlike an outburst I let 
out when I found out that I had to 
write the column this week.

Council then ended on a light 
note with the introduction of various 
college events, which, at that point, 
was probably all they could handle.

Council Discusses Smoke-Free 
Policy and Spending Limits

Scalia how he applied “originalism” 
to phenomena like equal rights for 
women and homosexual couples, 
when such terms were not in exis-
tence during the writing of the 
Constitution. 

Scalia said that at the time the 
14th Amendment was adopted in 
1868, homosexuality was outlawed 
by all states. 

He said the law’s original mean-
ing never provided for homosexual 

rights, let alone homosexual con-
duct.

“I think the way we think about 
things changes,” said Teshuva, a 
political science and history double 
major. “Things have different mean-
ings for different people. There is no 
original meaning.”

Yet Scalia reiterated the courts 
should have no judgment on morali-
ty.  He said that new laws or amend-
ments can be passed to reflect 
changes in society, and that a strong 
democracy should not depend on 

rules decided upon by just nine 
justices. He even highlighted the 
homogeneity of the justices as a lack 
of their capacities.

“You ask nine unrepresentative 
lawyers, all from Harvard and Yale... 
It just boggles the mind why any 
society would want these profound 
moral questions to be decided by 
people who have no particular 
expertise in that area,’’ Scalia said.

Miraculously,  
We Always 
Have Time 
for Fun

All too often, we are burdened by the painful necessity of good time management. Yes, 
we want to graduate summa cum 
laude. Yes, we want to attend Friday-
night revelry (or, in my case, throw 
paper airplanes off the balcony of 
Asia Hall). And despite these ambi-
tious aspirations, we naively figure we 
might be able to do all this and still 
get some sleep. We are perfectly capa-
ble, though, of managing our time—
we just love to manage it incorrectly.

It’s not that we have much say 
in the matter, either. According to 
University of Calgary psychology 
professor Dr. Piers Steel, our short-
term planning is done by certain 
parts of the brain that form the limbic 
system, a more primitive set of struc-
tures concerned with immediate and 
concrete rewards. Our rational long-
term choices, on the other hand, are 
tasked to the brain’s prefrontal cortex, 
a section typically responsible for 
decision-making. Unfortunately for 
us, the limbic system has a tendency 
to overpower our responsibility and 
common sense, causing us to greed-
ily pursue whatever is most readily 
accessible, which usually leads to 
us peeling open another Snickers 
bar, breaking our “vegetarian-week” 
pledge or skipping gym day in favor 
of reruns of “The Office.”  

There are exceptions to this rule, 
however. Our intentions for prescient 
time allocation are easily derailed by 
our desire for instant gratification 
and amusement. While we readily 
turn down opportunities for work 
not due until later, mumbling some-
thing about a lack of time and a need 
to focus on the present, we’re always 
able to make time for fun. When 
faced with the seductive prospect of a 
weekend beach day, we miraculously 
start planning for the future. We have 
no problem packing on study hours 
in advance to free up some leisure 
time. The slots in our calendars allot-
ted to homework always seem to end 
up much more flexible than those for 
enjoying ourselves.

It isn’t hard to understand why we 
are so bad at giving responsibilities 
the time they deserve. For starters, 
we woefully underestimate the hours 
we waste distracting ourselves and 
take comfort in the notion that we 
still have time. This happens because 
that pesky limbic system unavoid-
ably kicks into high gear every time 
we see a possible diversion with 
very short time delay — checking 
Facebook, playing a quick game 
of Temple Run or sending a quick, 
innocuous text. 

The instantaneous satisfaction that 
each little distraction produces makes 
it rather difficult to rationalize the 
reward of good grades in the future 
or a good night’s rest. As a result, we 
find ourselves sleepily poring over 
textbooks, cursing the clock’s rapid 
passage and gazing longingly at our 
beds. We proceed to vow against any 
and all distractions for the duration 
of the quarter, yet we find ourselves 
dawdling again the next day, wonder-
ing how our resolve evaporated.

But while your future now seems 
cast in a shadow of inefficiency and 
irresponsibility, don’t lose hope quite 
yet — you can vanquish that treach-
erous limbic system. Plan that beach 
day, but take your work with you, 
and leave your phone at home. Your 
calendar will thank you later. 

You would think that after arti-
cles and articles about the recent 
A.S. elections, we at the Guardian 
would be ready to move on to other 
news. But don’t get too excited, 
because we still have a few more 
bones to pick. 

After countless hours of inter-
viewing all of the candidates this 
season including the newly elected, 
we have two things to say: First, 
congratulations to all those who 
won. Second, we have pages and 
pages of notes listing out what 
exactly each councilmember plans 
to do in his/her position, and we 
are looking forward to some seri-
ous follow-through. 

A.S. President-elect Andrew 
Buselt has a particularly large list 
of tasks to accomplish when he 
assumes his position during week 
five. Buselt has promised to bring 
more transparency, accessibility 
and diverse community interac-
tion to A.S. We think he can do it; 
Buselt does have a track record of 
completing various senator proj-

ects focusing on fostering student 
discussion and LGBT awareness 
— let’s see these projects continue 
during his presidency.

We will also be interested in 
watching Buselt’s promised efforts 
to *fix our campus’ most pressing 
issue: transportation. Buselt believes 
that the solution to the TPS crisis 
is a future referendum and has 
already given himself a name with 
his somewhat lofty hope to imple-
ment a revamped bicycle system 
on campus. He’s going to face quite 
a few bumps in the road (literally, 
given our campus topography) with 
a Bicycle and Pedestrian Master 
Planning Study estimate of $13.9 
million in improvements, and we’ll 
see how he attains those funds to 
make such a crucial part of his 
presidential campaign a reality.

Like Buselt, vice president of 
student life Linda Le has a great 
deal of projects up her sleeve — 
maybe a little too many to handle. 
Le is promising a campus culture 
change, accessibility and increased 

spirit and A.S. awareness like every 
other candidate, but we hope that 
her pledged plans to create student 
life strategic planning meetings, 
community building projects and 
college survival guides will ground 
these goals and yield some tangible 
change for student life.

We are also looking forward to 
our new vice president of finance 
Sean O’Neal and vice president of 
external affairs Vanessa Garcia. 
Being the current chief of staff for 
the office, O’Neal is starting out 
with a concrete, long-term plan 
to make A.S. a fiscally sustainable 
501(c)(3) non-profit organiza-
tion. He has a very comprehensive 
understanding of the A.S. budget, 
with ideas to create a greener, more 
transparent A.S., and we are really, 
really, hoping to see some actual 
change from him.

VP External Garcia, like all oth-
ers, has a great deal of ideas and 
goals. She also has many potential 
solutions for issues such as trans-
portation, revamping the external 

affairs office, increasing student 
activism, working with UC SHIP 
and forging connections with uni-
versity communities. Garcia plans 
to strengthen GSA and alumni 
relationships and use untapped 
power in student organizations to 
help address council issues. She is a 
major force, and if the momentum 
she has now translates into real 
transformation, we might just be 
moving toward Division-I athlet-
ics sooner than we thought while 
maintaining fiscal responsibility.

Keep it Real-dominated campus-
wide senators, however, are a bit 
more of a reach. Many of these 
newly-elects have the goals of 
increasing accessibility and improv-
ing campus climate that seem to 
be buzz-word requirements when 
speaking to the Guardian, but we 
are a little more than anxious to see 
how they create concrete plans. 

Nevertheless, these fresh faces 
will bring some new blood and 
hopefully new ideas to council, 
which we are in dire need of. 

Council-Elects Must Follow Through with Campaign Promises

Forget blue and gold — UCSD is seeing teal. The slate Keep it Real took the 2013–2014 A.S. 
Council elections by a landslide, winning 
president and two out of three vice-
presidential positions. All five of their 
campuswide senatorial candidates also 
gained seats. With slate head Andrew 
Buselt soon to spearhead council as A.S. 
president, Keep it Real is in a position of 
immense power. While we applaud them 
for performing an almost clean sweep of 
the election, we hope that they will now 
put students before political interests as 
they take their next steps — namely in 
choosing which associate vice presidents 
to appoint to the A.S. cabinet.

Under the president and three 
vice presidents, eleven AVPs oversee 
specialized departments which range 
from Academic Affairs and Student 
Organizations, to Local Affairs and 
Concerts and Events. AVPs are non-
voting members of council, and each 
receives a compensation package of 
around $3,500. Selection committees for 
these AVPs are assembled randomly from 

members of the newly elected senate and 
ex-officio representatives. These panels 
interview each AVP candidate, vote and 
then offer recommendations to the execu-
tives in charge of each AVP’s office. The 
newly elected executive can choose to 
accept or veto these recommendations.

With Keep it Real candidates dominat-
ing the new senate, they will also logisti-
cally make up the bulk of each selection

Putting Soda Pants into some 
coherent musical narrative is tough — 
without the reader actually listening 
to them, folk-rock will have to suffice. 
The band, made up of Erin Bower, 
Will Chapman, Grady Kestler and 
Mike Sierks, has only been playing 
together for a year, and while they’ve 
already had an “It’s a Small World” 
tour this past summer, their recorded 
output has been limited.

“We recorded a bunch of stuff on a 
computer ... and put it on a CD. And 
then decorated them all,” Sierks says.

Of course, this paucity of music is 
normal for a new band. What makes 
this band so hard to contextualize is 
their lack of a definitive style. Their 
fluidity is immediately evident at 
their shows. All four musicians trade 

instruments throughout the show, 
never sticking to their original for 
more than a couple of songs. Even in 
the studio, they trade roles, sometimes 
writing songs and sometimes backing 
their bandmates’ songs.

“We all write songs, and because of 
that I think we’re confused as a band 
as to what our style is ... [it] is all over 
the place,” Bower says. 

Given their instrumentation 
— guitar, banjo, violin, percussion 
and sometimes even clarinet — it’s 
easiest to compare them to The 
Lumineers, Mumford & Sons and 
The Avett Brothers. But even with-
in this genre, Soda Pants remains 
fluid. Their songs range from the 
upbeat to the almost elegiac.

“If you listen to a song about cry-

ing or cheating, you know it’s me and 
Erin writing,” Chapman said. “If it’s 
happy and fun, it’s Mike and Grady.”

But what’s so remarkable about 
Soda Pants is how the musicians’ obvi-
ous chemistry makes their undefined 
quality so damn fun. When they trade 
instruments on stage between songs, 
it doesn’t slow the show down (all of 
them chat amiably to the fans during 
lulls). More importantly, it doesn’t feel 
chaotic, but organic.

Soda Pants will be displaying this 
organic style at Muirstock tomorrow 
night. By virtue of winning an on-
campus battle of the bands, they’ll be 
playing Sun God Festival in May as 
well. What comes after that is unclear, 
but hopefully the future brings more 
music from Soda Pants.

Most would agree that acoustic 
and country music don’t get a lot of 
appreciation on college campuses, but 
student performer Madeline Mann 
makes a damn good case for both 
genres. Mann, a singer and guitarist, 
has rightfully earned an incredibly 
devoted following, evidenced at her 
crowd-pleasing performance at Battle 
of the Bands earlier this month. And 
crowd-pleasing is an understatement. 
Mann’s somewhat intoxicated fans 
were so excited about her music that 
they kept interrupting her with shouts 
of adoration between songs. 

Mann’s music is mostly guitar and 
vocals, although some songs incor-
porate ukulele, tambourine and key-
board. Since 2011, her performances 
have also included Dana Point surfer 
and guitarist Omead Arami, adding 
his beachy acoustics to give a more 

varied and mature sound. Mostly 
though, her music is guitar and vocals.

“I think that lyrics are what 
connect me with music and what 
I can bring people in with, and a 
lot of the time it’s humor that I use 
to convey what I’m feeling,” Mann 
explained in an interview with the 
UCSD Guardian.

Her humor is definitely a strong 
point, and many of her songs, includ-
ing “That’s Just My Face” and “Geeks: 
Hot Guys with Four Eyes,” come off 
as humorous while still remaining 
honest when conveying her thoughts 
and feelings. Her music has more to 
offer than comedic value — it’s meant 
to instill a feeling of happiness and a 
zest for life.

Though lighthearted, her songs 
are carefully written and meticulously 
chosen for performing sets. 

“For every 15 songs I would write, 
maybe one I would play for anyone in 
public because I always throw things 
out,” Mann said. “Since then I’ve writ-
ten so much more and started per-
forming more.”

The experience that she has had 
as a performer shows in her confident 
and upbeat demeanor on stage as 
well as her professional vocal ability 
and musicianship. She can be found 
performing with Arami at open mic 
nights on campus and at venues in 
the community every few weeks 
and will open for acoustic pop star 
Joseph Vincent on April 30. Many 
of her songs can also be found on 
her YouTube channel and are free to 
download. Madeline Mann is barely 
in her twenties and already taking 
her music far beyond her country 
and folk influences.

The description “breaking the 
mold” is so often attached to deriva-
tive bands that applying this predicate 
to a genuinely innovative group would 
make them seem almost conventional 
by association. So don’t think of Day 
of Champions as “breaking the mold.” 
Because, overused honorifics aside, 
Day of Champions actually is original. 

DOC is the rare rap group that 
relies on live instruments rather 
than computer programs for its 
sound. Lyricist Alier Johnson — 
reminiscent of J. Cole — is support-
ed by Nina Dumas on bass, Andrew 
Ramos on guitar, Kyle Valenzuela 
(UCSD alumnus) on drums and 
Troy Tomasello (current UCSD 
student) on keys. This emphasis 
on live instrumentation is DOC’s 
rebuttal to the majority of rap acts 
in which all the sound seems to be 
coming from a MacBook.

“Live music is so far and beyond ... 
pressing the play button on a fucking 
computer,” Dumas said.

As openers for acts such as 
Murs (at Sun God Festival last 
year), the Game and Freddie Gibbs, 
DOC has gotten confirmation from 
ecstatic fans.

“The counterattack came along 
once we started seeing reaction from 
the crowds at our shows,” Johnson 
said. “How they responded was great. 
It shows that live instruments can 
still get large crowds all dancing and 
having a good time.”

Day of Champion’s originality 
touches more than just instru-
mentation. Dumas is a female bass 
player in a genre dominated by men 
and misogyny.

“Being the only girl in a hip-hop 
band ... has been difficult for me,” she 
said. “I would never want the fact that 

I am in a hip-hop band [make people 
believe] that I don’t respect myself or 
other women.”

The way DOC subverts conven-
tion is even more evident at shows. 
The band has a habit of playing covers 
of well-known songs by artists like 
Kendrick Lamar and Tupac, which is 
almost unheard of in rap music.

“[Doing covers] gives listeners an 
idea of where they can place us in 
the industry, and also it gives them a 
chance to vibe along with us if they’ve 
never heard us,” Johnson said.

Soon, though, there might not be 
many people left who haven’t heard 
of DOC. An extended play set for 
release this summer will showcase 
this collection of extremely talented 
musicians, and if the band’s live 
material is any indication, DOC’s 
attack against the traditional rap 
paradigm will end in victory.

During an age in which artists 
are musically typecast, those seek-
ing an eclectic sound can find it in 
San Diego-based band The Howls. 
Transcending genres, the quintet 
made up of vocalist/guitarist John 
Cooper, bassist Caleb Chial, drum-
mer Dave Gargula, guitarist Chris 
Garcia and keyboardist Nik Ewing 
brews a blend of roots rock with 
alternative overtones reminiscent 
of Wilco and Tom Petty. The band’s 

debut album “The Rocky Ground” 
spawns a nostalgic sound, taking the 
listener to the open road in search of 
a shabby bar where a bottle of Jack 
and good company make for one hell 
of a good time.

 From humble beginnings as a trio 
of friends starting out in 2008, the 
band’s reputation as well as the band 
itself has grown in a matter of mere 
years. After first getting airplay on 
San Diego radio stations FM 94.9 and 

91X, The Howls have now gone on to 
open for bands such as OK Go and 
Fitz and the Tantrums. Despite sell-
ing out local shows, they’re looking 
to extend their reach by continuing 
to break the mold while maintaining 
that timeless vinyl sound. Even if alt-
country doesn’t bode well with your 
taste, these gentlemen find a way to 
get you off your feet in time to down 
a drink (or seven) of the finest musi-
cal brew.

T he movie “Spring Breakers” would lead you to believe that a vacation in Mexico is a 
whirlwind of arrests, skimpy bikinis, 
debauchery and drugs — starring 
James Franco in braces singing 
Britney Spears.

We decided to try our own version 
of a Mexican Spring Break. Horrified 
by the prices of travel and accom-
modation to Cabo and Cancun, we 
Googled alternative possibilities. The 
24-hour drive down south some of 
our fellow I-Housers embarked on 
seemed like a less than ideal ride. We 
then stumbled across “Gus the Bus” 
from Baja Trek.

Gus is an old red school bus that 
runs on the vegetable oil of Chinese 
restaurants. It is home to Nico the 
cowboy, his partner Kally and their 
half-wolf half-German Shepherd, 
Lobo. For six years Nico has been 
driving a variety of tourists around 
Baja California, travelling to Hot 
Springs, mud baths, deserted beaches 
and Papas & Beer.

We booked with good faith, not 
really knowing what to expect. At the 
border, we met Thomas Sexton the 
volunteer, a ginger giant covered in 
facial hair and bandages; he was also 
unable to answer any of our questions 
though did manage (just about) to 
lead us to the bus.

As the week progressed, we saw a 
different side to the initially shy Tom. 
Permanently wasted, smoking his 
THC pen and constantly laughing at/
mocking our accents, Tom Ton-of-Sex 
backwards went from being a source 
of amusement to a source of constant 
alarm. On our final morning, hav-
ing lost his glasses and thrown up on 
himself in Papas & Beer the previous 
night, Tom dropped his drugs into 
one of our backpacks as we were 
about to cross the border to America. 
The only one not to grasp the gravity 
of this situation was Tom.

While we didn’t get to travel to San 
Felipe due to Santa Ana winds and 
the threat of sandstorms, we stuck to 
the west coast of Baja California. We 
would highly recommend visiting the 
beautiful and deserted Long Beach, 
either camping amongst the sand 
dunes or staying at the hostel Coyote 
Cal’s. We were delighted to discover 
one of the nicest (and cheapest) hos-
tels we have ever come across. Five 
margaritas for $15, the same price as a 
room for one night. 

Rosarito is the home of our second 
recommendation: the local Papas & 
Beer. Never before have we been to a 
club complete with an open bar, danc-
ing podium, mechanical bull and full 
size volleyball court. If only if it were 
a viable venue for Mia’s 21st birthday 
bash. We spent the night downing Sex 
on the Beach and taking center stage 
with our appalling volleyball perfor-
mances. We awoke the next morning 
with incredibly swollen wrists and 
burst blood vessels due to over enthu-
siastic serving.

Cabo, Cancun, Rosarito — though 
undeniably fun and foam-filled, they 
cannot really be differentiated and 
are a poor tribute to the potential of 
Mexican tourism. It seems a shame 
that most Americans,  and even 
Europeans, are either scared of the 
dangers of Mexico or see it as a place 
for overpriced tequila jelly shots. It 
was the beauty of the deserted beaches 
and the authentic cuisine that we most 
appreciated. When we go back, it will 
definitely be to places even less well 
travelled. “Gus the Bus” will always 
have a full tank; oil crisis or not, veg-
etable oil will make the wheels of Gus 
go round and round.

Coachella
Whether you’re a faithful returnee or a total newbie, it’s always good to prepare for the greatest 
gift of the desert next to water. Here’s our guide to making your Coachella as chill as possible.

BY  Naire  ter-galstyan  Staff writer

I t’s that time of year again. The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival is here, and it’s time to pack your bags and head out into the blistering hot desert. Coachella is a three-day 
festival that takes place in Indio, Calif. every year over the span 
of two weekends. Talented musicians and artists from all genres 
join forces to give fans the time of their lives. This year, some 
of the performances to look forward to include Phoenix,The 
Postal Service, Wu-Tang Clan and Vampire Weekend. Music 
lovers travel long distances to attend the festival and see their 
favorite performers. If you’re a Coachella newbie, there are a 

lot of mistakes you’ll make. Do some research and make sure 
you’re prepared. 

“The mistake I made before was I didn’t wear comfortable 
shoes and comfortable clothes,” Thurgood Marshall College senior 
Beradin Jezeh said. “I wasn’t happy for most of the day; you walk 
around so much I’ve learned that comfort trumps style — at least 
for me — in the shoe department.”

We know this is an exciting time for those lucky enough to get 
tickets, but now that you’re going, there are a few things you can’t 
forget to pack. Here’s a cheat sheet on all the things you’ll need:

1. Make a customized list of your 
must-see artists. Know where and 
when they are playing. This will save 
you and your group from having to 
stand around in the heat trying to 
figure out your next step.

7. Bring sunglasses. Something 
cheap is preferred. If you drop your 
sunglasses in the middle of a huge 
crowd, you it’s better to lose brand 
X sunnies over your Ray Bans.

3. Bring cash. Although some 
places will accept cards, carry-
ing cash makes everything a lot 
easier. Also, it guarantees having 
access to everything and keeps 
you from standing in line at the 
ATM where you may have to pay 

unnecessary fees.

9. Having baby wipes and sanitiz-
ing cloths is essential. This will be 
the easiest and fastest way to stay 
fresh and keep clean. Showering 
won’t be an option during the 
day, so use these wipes to relieve 
yourself of your sweat combined 
with dirt. The people around you 

will appreciate it.

Pizza is recommended because you’ll be able to eat and 
walk at the same time. The Terrace, which is conveniently 
located in the center of Coachella, and it’s, is a great place 
to grab some pizza and they also have a beer garden. Also 
available are a variety of options from there food vendors 
and restaurants in the Coachella Valley area, such as Ruth’s 
Chris Steak House and Las Casuelas Quinta. Food trucks 

will also be available, along with full bars. Take what you 
must, sit in the shade and drink water constantly. 

5. Bring water. Water will be your 
best friend over the Coachella 
weekend. Make sure to take more 
than just one, or bring a reusable 
eco-friendly bottle to fill up every 
chance you get. Staying hydrated 

will ensure a healthy weekend.

2. Carry a backpack. There are 
many things you’ll need to take 
with you, like a map, tickets and 
extra clothes. Having a backpack 
will eliminate the stress on your 
shoulders that tote bags may 
cause. 

8. Wear comfortable shoes. 
Everyone wants to look fashion-
able at Coachella, but once you’re 
there, the only thing that will 
really matter is how comfortable 
you are. Keep in mind there is a 
lot of walking that goes on. Try 
to stay away from open-toed 
shoes because you will probably 
get stepped on and getting dirt 
in your toes is not the greatest 
feeling. Having an extra pair of 
socks is also a good idea.

4. Apply sunblock and lip 
balm. Keep in mind the festival 
takes place in a desert, and the 
last thing you want to deal with 
is getting sunburned and hav-
ing chapped lips. They are small 
items but they go a long way.

10. Have a meet up location in case 
someone gets lost. Keep in mind 
getting cellphone reception will 
be close to impossible. Keep 
your phone on airplane mode to 
save as much battery as possible. 
There will be charging locations 
around, so charge when you can.

6. Layering pieces are impor-
tant. Although it is blistering 
hot during the day, once the 
sun goes down, the weather will 
drop. Having a layer piece will 
keep you warm during the chilly 
desert nights.

“The Place Beyond the Pines” is 
far from Hollywood’s mainstream. 
It is a genre hybrid of crime thriller, 
family drama and a coming-of-age 
story. Derek Cianfrance (direc-
tor of the critically lauded drama 
“Blue Valentine,” also starring Ryan 
Gosling) has once again powerfully 
celebrated the glory of American 
narrative cinema. Full of intense 
plot, profound character perfor-
mances and rich imagery, “The 

Place Beyond The Pines” takes you 
on a deep emotional journey with 
unexpected turns.

What makes this film so com-
pelling is its dexterous structure 
into three distinct yet perfectly 
intertwined chapters. While most 
films usually center on one hero 
only, Cianfrance deliberately 
chooses to tell the dramatic stories

P oor Sam Beam. The musician behind Iron and Wine lost even his most poignantly writ-
ten song about his frustrations with 
society, “Flightless Bird, American 
Mouth,” to the mainstream clutches 
of the schmaltzy “Twilight” film 
franchise. This wider exposure — 
especially to teenyboppers — could 
have had a negative bearing on 
Beam’s newer work.

However, Beam is blessed with 
the musical Midas touch: Whatever 
he writes and performs is simply 
golden. His latest release “Ghost 
on Ghost” is no exception. Indeed, 
“Ghost” does lean more toward 
cleaner sounds compared to his 
celebrated raw, moody debut, “The 
Creek Drank the Cradle.” Still 
armed with his trusty acoustic gui-
tar, he experiments in “Ghost” by 
combining slick jazz melodies with 
his traditional fare of folk-rock.

The 20-second intro of a 
cacophony of various instruments 
already hints that the rest of the 
album will be a departure from Iron 
and Wine’s typical work, until Beam 
begins plucking away at the guitar 
strings in “Caught in the Briars.” 
This first track sets the mood for 
the rest of “Ghost,” which is decid-
edly dominated by cheerful melo-
dies, from the Beatle-esque riffs of 
“Grace for Saints and Ramblers” 

to the aptly named, laid-back lead 
single “Joy.” The latter hints at Iron 
and Wine’s maturation, as the musi-
cal poet’s opening verse could be 
likened to his career’s journey: “I’m 
a bluebird dying but singing the 
blues/ And it’s a heartfelt silly sort 
of bumbling tune/ But you’re bring-
ing me joy.”

This allusion to the blues 
emphasizes the album’s aura of a 
jazz club, with brass instruments 
permeating most of the tracks, 
including a saxophone solo thrown 
in the middle of “Low Light Buddy 
of Mine,” in case we ever doubted 
what genre Beam was playing. His 
novel sound gives the soft, quivery 
voice from his earliest bedroom 
recordings a newfound confidence 
and inner strength that is refresh-
ing to hear in “Ghost” and that 
is perfectly suited to the original 
sonic paths he is paving.

Beam is clearly not a dabbler in 
various musical techniques, as the 
mixture of folk and jazz works per-
fectly to encompass his new sleek 
sounds. With “Ghost on Ghost,” 
Iron and Wine proves Beam’s ver-
satility yet again, and there’s no 
amount of mainstream exposure 
can change that.

Sam Beam puts a carefully polished, jazzy spin on 
his usual quiet, folksy melodies.

“It won’t come off,” says Carly Beth 
as she tugs at the rotting, leathery skin 
of her gruesome Halloween mask. 
Then suddenly, Sabrina turns pale. 

“What’s the matter?” asks Carly 
Beth, panicking, her voice muffled 
behind a rack of mangled fangs.

“There’s no bottom to this mask,” 
Sabrina gasps. “There’s no place 
I can reach my hand in.” And the 
recurring nightmares of 100,000 
preteens are born.  

With what is perhaps the most 
casually unnerving introduction 
to a TV special ever conceived, 
Goosebumps’ “The Haunted Mask” 
plants its infected roots deep within 
the first few minutes. The camera first 
pans across a line of masks — hellish 
ghouls with bloated flesh and contort-
ed faces — before landing on the most 
hideous creature of all. But this face is 
alive. A pale, sickly looking man with 
a slight hunchback introduces him-
self as R.L. Stine just before he offers 
us one cruelly understated warning: 
“Viewers beware, you’re in for a scare.”

“The Haunted Mask” owes much 
of its impact to Stine’s simple and 
deeply psychological premise. A 
young girl named Carly Beth (played 
here by a bizarrely talented child 
actress named Kathryn Long) is sick 
of constantly being the butt of her

Muirstock
Justin Nozuka will headline this year’s Muirstock on April 19, with 
festivities starting at 2 p.m. and live music starting at 5 p.m.

with a month left to wait for Sun God Festival, many stu-dents find themselves looking 
forward to free live music on cam-
pus, and Muirstock is the answer. 
Muirstock is an annual music festi-
val that culminates John Muir Week. 
As one of Muir College’s longest 
standing traditions, Muirstock is 
always anticipated as one of spring 
quarter’s best events. This year’s 
music selection takes the motto of 
Muir, “Celebrating the indepen-
dent spirit” into consideration by 
selecting independent artists for the 
music acts. Muirstock event coordi-
nator Jarrel Biscocho explained the 
vision for this year’s festival. 

“We primarily wanted to pro-
mote the great music scene in 
San Diego,” Bischocho said, “Paul 
Cannon Band, David Booda, 
Sodapants and Cartoon Lion are 
all local artists that have great stage 
presence.”

This year’s Muirstock committee 
worked to bring in music that would 
appeal to all audiences.

“For headliner, we wanted 
someone who is very strong vocally 
and can really work an audience 
and bring in a crowd,” Biscocho 
said. “We feel that Justin Nozuka 
has these qualities — even though 
the artists are not the most known 
per se, I think attendants will be 
impressed by their musical ability,” 
Biscocho said.

Muirstock has traditionally been 
an event hosted by Muir students 

for Muir students. This year the goal 
was to make it a campuswide event.

“I wanted it to not be just a 
concert for Muir, but rather a con-
cert for the school held by Muir,” 
Biscocho said. 

Environmentalism has always 
been an important part of Muir 
College’s mission.

“This year we are really proud 
of working with BAAN [Biofuels 
Action and Awareness Network] to 
have the event run entirely on bio-

fuel, ” Biscocho said. 
Muir has an open grass field 

where students can sit down, relax 
and enjoy the music with friends in 
an intimate environment. Students 
can expect a plethora of free fare: 
BBQ, hookah from the General 
Store and a photo booth, in addition 
to booths from the Zone, Outback 
Adventures and the Econauts.

D aoFu, previously called Tao Restaurant, is in the heart of Normal Heights, right across 
the street from UCSD-friendly cof-
fee shop Lestat’s. Despite its self-
proclaimed genre of Asian fusion 
of Vietnamese and Japanese, a step 
through the door reveals a warm, 
summer night feel with a vintage 
Chinese film atmosphere. However, 
the restaurant isn’t fully submerged 
in the Orient — there are have 
forks, and the menu is completely in 
English. The atmosphere is an eclec-
tic mix, bringing the best of Asian 
culture into a comfortable setting 
for anyone who wants a taste of the 
Far East.

The design is different from the 
typical Asian restaurant: There are 
thatched roofs on either end of the 
rectangular building, which gives 
the illusion of being outdoors even 
though you’re inside. The red lan-
terns strung overhead, the enormous 

oriental vase in front of the entrance 
and the soft string music adds to 
the Chinese feel. After taking in the 
interior, the complimentary pre-meal 
salad is brought out, ingredients 
bought fresh from the Adams Avenue 
Farmers Market. The greens are 
slightly overpowered by the sweet yet 
acidic fruit dressing, which is as red 
as blood and tastes just like raspber-
ries. The dressing, though thick, isn’t 
heavy, and it doesn’t take away from 
the refreshingly light salad.

After ordering from the three-fold 
menu of vegetarian options, regular 
dishes and drinks, the walls of DaoFu 
begin to stand out. The once-white 
walls are now plastered with crayon 
scribbles, anime-style doodles and 
anything else any customer wants to 
draw. It’s a free-for-all — if you can 
find space.

The contrast between the wall art 
and the Oriental mood softens the 
stuffy, pristine look that many other 
restaurants have, so it’s a nice place for 
a date. The restaurant is dim enough 
to be romantic and roomy, but so dark 
that you need to squint to see the food 
on your plate.

A fried tofu appetizer ($3) is the 
first dish to come out. It consists of 
a block of pan-fried tofu sitting in a 
soy sauce concoction and topped with 
shallots and red pepper. It is crispy 
and cool on the outside but hot and 
soft on the inside. The large size of 
the plate allows for big portions and a 
decorative arrangement of meals.

Their mock chicken is a little on 
the gooey and soft side, but the meat 
texture is definitely there. Their real 

chicken is more of the opposite: It 
tastes overcooked and dry, not the 
juicy texture customers may be look-
ing for.

Pricing is pretty spot-on, except 
for drinks. Their alcohol selection is 
rather small — only a limited variety 
of wine, beer and sake — so no mixed 
drinks here. The white wine ($7) is 
served un-chilled, and only half of 
the enormous glass is filled, making it 
seem like there’s less than there really 
is. Rather than coming to the restau-
rant for drinks, order an asahi or sake 
to complement the meal.

Their level of spiciness is definitely 
worth noting. On a scale of one to 10, 
a one is considered mild, and a two is 
pretty spicy. Nevertheless, many peo-
ple do choose the 10th level. However, 
the spice differs for each dish. The 
chicken mango dish ($9.20) is one to 
be eaten with the spice, as it comple-

ments the sweetness of the mango. 
At the end comes the complimen-

tary ice cream. The scoop is small, but 
it is the perfect size to refresh and bal-
ance your palate from all that spice in 
the main dishes. It comes on a square 
plate arranged with a slice of straw-
berry and mango and is drizzled with 
mango and strawberry syrup.

The customer service at DaoFu is 
friendly and accommodating. It could 
be because the restaurant is rather 
small, but even on a packed Saturday 
night, the employees will occasion-
ally take turns asking you whether 
you have been seated until you’re no 
longer crowding the entrance. The 
wait is short, the food is good and the 
ambiance provides a departure from 
the norm.

friends’ cruel Halloween spooks. 
She wants more than anything to be 
frightening. After she acquires a par-
ticularly disturbing mask from a mys-
terious novelty shop, Carly Beth sets 
off on a sadistic orgy of hell-raising 
high-jinx. But it isn’t long before the 
mask begins to change Carly Beth, 
and the show’s prepubescent viewer-
ship is suddenly confronted with 
a complicated existential morality 
play about the price we pay when we 
choose to abandon our identity.

In short, the show starts with two 
precocious girls trick-or-treating on a 
misty Halloween night and ends with 
a satanic goblin-girl burying a realistic 
bust of her former (unmasked) self in 
a graveyard and shouting “I’m sup-
posed to be me, but I’m not!” at trem-
bling throngs of toddlers.

“The Haunted Mask” catches you 
off guard with its calculated subtlety 
— it relies less on cheap scares and 
more on a steady-building dread that 
suffocates like Carly Beth’s cursed 

mask. Figures are soft-focused and 
painterly, lit by moonbeams. The 
script is crammed with believ-
able adolescent interaction and 
a melange of disturbing images 
(“These pumpkins are so rotten,” 
Carly Beth remarks casually during 
an early-on graveyard stroll). 

The result is a surreal horror soap 
opera more unrelenting than “Twin 
Peaks,” a lost relic of ’90s children’s 
horror and a genuinely frightening 
cerebral drama. 

Perhaps most unsettling, however, 
is the inexplicable secret harbored in 
the film’s opening credits. A decade 
later, screenwriter Jose Rivera would 
go on to write the Oscar-nominated 
script to the Che Guevara road trip 
movie “The Motorcycle Diaries.” 
What madness is this? How could 
such a weaver of nightmares be pos-
sessed to create life-affirming stories 
of friendship and adventure? What 
dark secrets lie beneath Che’s poetic 
cross-country travels? 

This, my beloved friends, is the 
secret of the mask.

of two, which makes it difficult 
for us to grasp what or whom the 
film is centrally about. It starts out 
with the story of Luke Glanton 
(Academy Award nominee Ryan 
Gosling), a multi-tattooed motor-
cycle stunt man who earns a living 
from riding at high speeds inside a 
mesh steel sphere called the Globe 
of Death at carnivals. Judging from 
his perilous job as well as his rebel-
lious appearance — chain-smoking, 
reveling in playing with fan knives 
and wearing dirty t-shirts inside 
out — Luke unequivocally creates 
the impression of being a filthy (yet 
admittedly dishy) badass.

However, as we plunge deeper 
into the story, Luke reveals his 
softer core. When finding out about 
having fathered a son with one-
night stand Romina (Eva Mendes), 
Luke decides to take responsibility 
for his son, despite already strug-
gling to care for himself (and the 
fact that the kid looks nothing like 

his mom). But love and despair 
cause him to make a momentous 
decision, initializing a set of severe 
consequences.

Armed with a mask, gun and 
combat boots, Luke turns into a 
persecuted bank robber, exploit-
ing his motorcycling skills to escape 
from the police. Cianfrance skillfully 
contrasts Luke’s ambiguity, though at 
times over-ambitiously, by means of 
breathtaking chase scenes and those 
depicting the harmonious family life. 
They not only effectively convey a 
strong picture of Luke’s character (the 
adrenaline junkie vs. the calm, loving 
father) but also keep the story inter-
esting and exciting.

A breathtaking chase between 
Luke and policeman Avery Cross 
(Bradley Cooper, “Silver Linings 
Playbook”) introduces us to the 
film’s second chapter: the life of 
Cross and his family. And so as 
one narrative unravels, the other is 
knitted. Cross’ life sets course for 
a dramatic trail that is reminiscent 
of Luke’s, yet on a whole different 

level. So as both stories become 
interlocked, the lives of both fami-
lies are calamitously impacted; in 
the course of the final chapter, “The 
Place Beyond the Pines” eventually 
climaxes with an electrifying open 
ending years later.

Cianfrance’s choice of 
soundtrack further accentuates 
the composition of emotions and 
characters. Melancholic songs by 
Mike Patton, Vladimir Ivanoff, 
Arvo Part, Bon Iver and Bruce 
Springsteen accompany the action 
persuasively and are strongly 
reminiscent of some of the thrilling 
driving scenes in the drama “Drive” 
directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, 
also starring Gosling. 

Broodingly earnest but perhaps 
too ardent in its execution, “The 
Place Beyond The Pines” is a cap-
tivating tragedy of courage, love, 
remorse and fear.

Halycon Days By Christie Yi LEttER  to  tHE  EdItoR

Dear Editor,
The escalation of drone attacks 

by the United States in northwestern 
Pakistan is a topic of much contention 
between the two countries. While the 
policy began under the Bush admin-
istration, the Obama administration 
has increased the use of drone strikes 
in Pakistan from one drone attack per 
year to approximately one every four 
days, causing anti-American senti-
ment to deepen among Pakistanis. 

Although the purpose of this 
strategy is to decrease terrorist activ-
ities by targeting militant groups 
including the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, 
it seems to be doing just the oppo-
site. Collateral damage resulting 
from the attacks creates nothing but 
support for militant groups who use 
civilian deaths as leverage to garner 
sympathy from the people of north-
western Pakistan, particularly in the 
tribal areas of Waziristan, a region 
that the central Pakistani govern-
ment has little control over. 

With an estimated 3,148 Pakistanis 
killed in drone attacks since 2004 (less 
than 2 percent of those killed are high 
profile militant targets), anger towards 
the United States is growing not only 
among militant hard liners but among 
ordinary Pakistani citizens. Those 
primarily affected by drone strikes in 

northwestern Pakistan are in the most 
defenseless position in the country. 

Largely ignored by Pakistan’s 
federal government, regional institu-
tions have failed to address the prob-
lems of the area’s residents. Already 
facing staggering rates of poverty 
and unemployment, young men in 
northwestern Pakistan are much 
more susceptible to recruitment from 
militant hard liners who capitalize on 
their vulnerability. Add relatives and 
friends being killed in drone strikes 
to a lack of economic opportunity, 
and you have a recipe for disaster. 

Interestingly enough, San Diego 
has been called the drone manu-
facturing capital of the world with 
UCSD providing research and 
development for drones used in 
places where the United States has 
not declared war including Pakistan, 
Somalia and Yemen. 

The Student Sustainability 
Collective, in conjunction with 
the Coalition of South Asian 
Peoples and the Pakistani Student 
Association, hosted an event on 
April 9 to discuss the legal implica-
tions of the covert drone policy and 
the concerns about human rights 
that arise as a result of this policy.

Current U.S. Drone Policy 
Is a Recipe for Disaster

They write that they strive to have a 
slate and councils that “don’t neces-
sarily have to agree on everything 100 
percent, but are willing to be agreeable 
and work toward concrete solutions.” 
We hope that in line with this prom-
ise, they won’t automatically usher 
friends into office. Fresh faces will be 
a good break for council, but selec-
tion committees need to make sure 
that they focus on whether candidates 
will bring to office experience and 
concrete, workable ideas for improv-
ing student life. Elections have been 
known to be catty, with candidates 
from opposing slates often crossing 
the lines of proper election conduct. 
A total of 24 election grievances were 
filed, with at least five for Keep it Real 

alone. However, in good faith for the 
rest of us, any bad feelings harbored 
against rivals from election season 
should be left behind in the dust.

In past years, strong council 
candidates who did not get elected 
typically apply to become AVPs. 
These candidates are usually the most 
promising options. We interviewed 
each and every one of the presidential, 
vice-presidential and campuswide 
senatorial candidates — excluding 
two who couldn’t meet with us due to 
time conflicts — for this past election, 
and we know for a fact that there are 
some wildly qualified AVP candidates 
out there. A.S. presidential candidates 
Sammy Chang and Courtney Hill, 
as well as vice-presidential candidate 
Leonard Bobbitt, were all AVPs this 
past year in the president’s office. 

Vice-presidential candidate Sarah 
Snook also served as an AVP under 
the office of Student Life. Each did a 
phenomenal job in office, and their 
institutional knowledge would be 
a huge asset to council (although 
Chang and Bobbitt are due to gradu-
ate), especially since it will take time 
for the newly elected councilmem-
bers to learn the ropes. If any AVP 
incumbents reapply for their posi-
tions or go for another AVP spot, 
they will be clear front-runners.

At a critical moment for our cam-
pus, as we deal with the transporta-
tion crisis, problems with UCEN 
funding and the threat of rising 
SHIP costs, partisan politics is not 
what A.S. Council needs. We hope 
that the new councilmembers will 
remember this.

AVPs Should be Chosen Based on Qualities, Not Personal Ties

GOLF

UCSD Golf  Places Sixth in Stanislaus
UCSD Golf finishes sixth in the Hanny Stanislaus Invitational this week. 
Tritons to prepare for CCAA Championships next week in Stockton, Calif.

The UCSD golf team took 
sixth place in the 16-team 
Hanny Stanislaus Invitational 
last week, April 17 to April 18. 
The Tritons finished with a score 
of 927 (+63) after three rounds. 
Host Cal State Stanislaus won the 
tournament with an overall score 
of 888 (+24). Fellow California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
member Cal State Monterey Bay 
finished in second, just two strokes 
behind third-place Great Northwest 
Athletic Conference member 
Western Washington University.

Stanislaus freshman Trevor 
Clayton carded first overall. The 
freshman was the only competitor 
in the 87-player field to finish under 
par. Sophomore Jay Lim led the 
Tritons through the 54-hole event. 
Lim finished 13 over par, with a 
score of 229, to tie for 16th overall. 
The sophomore carded scores of 

71 and 75 in the first and second 
rounds but fell off in the last round, 
scoring an 83.

“Overall, my individual perfor-
mance was frustrating, because I 
was in contention early on, and in 
the final round I kind of blew it, but 
overall, it was a good experience,” 
Lim said.

Senior Fredrik Palmer-Picard 
was the next-highest finisher for 
UCSD, carding 232, while junior 
Lewis Simon tied for 30th, with 
a score of 235. Freshman Clayton 
Yamaguchi recorded just one stroke 
behind Simon and junior Ryan 
Rankin slated a 247 (+31).

“I think we should have definite-
ly at least gotten fifth out there,” Lim 
said. “One of my teammates had an 
unfortunate two-stroke penalty, so 
although we did well, we probably 
should have been in the top-five.”

As the last tournament of the 
regular season, the Hanny Stanislaus 
Invitational served as a precursor 

for the CCAA conference cham-
pionships. Eight of the 10 partici-
pating CCAA teams took part in 
the invitational, one week before 
the CCAA Championships, April 22 
and April 23 at the Hunter Ranch 
Golf Course in Paso Robles, Calif.

“We’re looking good; we’re going 
to try out, maybe, a new lineup next 
week in conference, right before the 
postseason,” Lim said. “We all just 
need to figure out how to finish 
off our rounds in the end and pull 
together.”

Last season, the Tritons finished 
third in the conference tournament 
in order to punch their first ticket 
to the NCAA Regionals since 2007. 
UCSD is currently ranked seventh 
in the region, and, with the top 10 
teams qualifying for regionals, will 
look to finish strong for a chance at 
a second straight regional berth.

Tritons Win Inaugural CCAA Invite

sive to urge her team onward. 
“Leah Gonzales came out and just 

put shots away,” Lizotte said. “Just so 
confident and precise in her shots 
— she knew what she wanted to do.” 

Gonzales, who led the team with 
five goals, had what was arguably her 
best game of the season and pushed 
her teammates to score four goals in 
the third quarter in order to tie the 
game at 6–6 going into the fourth.

“We feed off each other, and when 
we get down, we need someone to 
step up and be a game-changer,” 
Lizotte said. “I definitely think Leah 
stepped up into that role that day.” 

In the final frame, UCSD went 
ahead 9–6 and withstood a push 

from Cal State East Bay to win the 
championship game 9–8. 

Freshman goalkeeper Courtney 
Miller had a good weekend for the 
Tritons, recording 12 saves in the 
championship game, and took home 
the tournament MVP honors. 

The Tritons will look to build 
on their recent successes when 
they jump back in the water 
this Friday, April 19, at home at 
Canyonview Pool, against Cal State 
San Bernardino at 6 p.m. UCSD will

This past weekend, the No. 17 nationally ranked UCSD women’s water polo team took home the first-ever California Collegiate Athletic Association Championship Invitational. The Tritons 
played two games in as many days, battling against their conference 
opponents in Fresno, Calif. UCSD entered the tournament as the No. 
1 seed and took home the title, improving its season record to 21–12 
overall.

In its first game, UCSD outplayed opponents Cal State Monterey 
Bay. The Tritons jumped out to an early 7–2 lead after the first quarter 
and never looked back. The Tritons came out and applied the pressure 
early on.

“In order to break the defense, we decided we would have to coun-
ter them,” UCSD junior Sarah Lizotte said. “That was our goal, and we 
did that, and it was a good start for us.”

The Tritons clamped down on the defensive end and smothered 

Cal State Monterey Bay, holding them to just one goal in the remain-
ing three quarters. 

Junior Melissa Bartow led the Tritons with four goals, and UCSD 
cruised to advance and play against Cal State East Bay the following 
day.

The game, played on Sunday April 14, proved to be a bigger chal-
lenge for the Tritons than the opening game of the tournament.

“We weren’t happy with how we played,” Lizotte said. “Of course, 
we were happy to win the game, but we definitely wish we would have 
performed better as a team.”

The Tritons found themselves down 5–2 at halftime and had 
to fight in order to get themselves back into the game. Junior Leah 
Gonzales proved to be the spark UCSD needed and came out aggres-

Softball Sweeps Stanislaus and Overtakes Second Place in CCAA

After sweeping Cal State Stanislaus, UCSD travels to Humboldt State to take 
on the first-ranked Lumberjacks in its penultimate regular season series.

The UCSD softball team slated 
its second series sweep of the sea-
son last week against bottom-of-
the-conference Cal State Stanislaus. 
With the four conference wins, 
UCSD has leapfrogged Sonoma 
State — when the Seawolves lost 
three games to Humboldt State — to 
take second place in the California 
Collegiate Athletics Association 
conference standings. The Tritons 
are now 21–7 in the CCAA, two 
games behind first-place Humboldt 
State (23–5 in the CCAA, 36–12 
overall) with two series left to play 
in the regular season.

In their first game on Friday, the 
Tritons won by their largest margin 
of the season in an 11–1 victory 
over the Warriors to take the sec-

ond leg of the doubleheader 11–3. 
Saturday’s games were closer, but 
not by much. The Tritons won 9–3 
and then 6–3 in the final game of 
the series. Four of UCSD’s pitchers 
— junior pitcher Jennifer Manuel, 
freshman Hannah Duarte, senior 
Michelle Escamilla and sophomore 
Kayla Hensel — earned a win in the 
conference series.

“I think everyone played strong 
and we came out as a team against 
Stanislaus,” Manuel said. “We just 
counted on each other, and every-
thing just sort of came together.”

Next up, the Tritons will have 
their hands full when they face 
last week’s Worth/CCAA Pitcher 
of the Week, Humboldt freshman 
Katie Obbema. Offensively, the 
Lumberjacks seem to be firing on all 
cylinders, recording six home runs 

in their last four games, one hit by 
Chrissy Stalf, leading the conference 
with 20 home runs on the season.

But the Tritons seem to be peak-
ing at the right point in their season. 
After a rocky start, UCSD has now 
strung together two series sweeps, 
punctuated by a silver-bracket 
win at the Mizuno Tournament 
of Champions. Furthermore, the 
Tritons now have recovered all of 
their players from the disabled list, 
as freshman ace Alexis Edwards, 
leading the league in ERA, returns 
to the roster. Redshirt sophomore 
Taylor Sepulveda went 7-for-16 at 
the plate, while junior Caitlin Brown 
and senior Nicole Spangler both 
went 6-for-14. Brown also recorded 
seven runs batted in over the course
