In an effort to increase 
accountability in higher educa-
tion, the National Association of 
State Universities and Land Grant 
Colleges unveiled College Portrait, 
a new tool for prospective stu-
dents and their families to com-
pare universities. The University 
of California will not be among 
the program’s participants, howev-
er, due to concerns regarding the 
validity of its standardized testing 
requirement.

Launched on Nov. 11, the pro-
gram’s goal is to provide comprehen-
sive online information about univer-
sities in order to assist students in the 
college selection process.

Although such information 
already existed on university Web 
sites, College Portrait offers two 
distinct features: a new method of 
reporting graduation and retention 
rates and the administration of a 
standardized test to a select number 
of students.

Developers hope that these two 
elements will serve as vehicles by 
which institutions of higher educa-
tion will become more account-

that current UC chancellor salary 
levels are well below those of other 
comparable universities. According 
to a UC-commissioned report, the 
salaries are currently 33 percent 
lower than those of like positions 
at a number of top universities, 
including Harvard University 
and Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology.

The UC Board of Regents 
approved its 2008-09 budget plan 
last week, which could potentially 
open the door for a significant hike 
in student fees over a multiyear 
period.

Beginning on July 1, 2008, the 
proposed budget would see a total 
increase of $378.2 million, or 7.2 
percent above the funds of the last 
fiscal year, placing the state-funded 
budget for the UC system at $3.46 
billion. This could mean a 7-per-
cent increase in student fees, unless 
state funds can supply an additional 
$70.5 million.

The university’s budget proposal 
has been criticized by students, fac-
ulty and UC executives, as it comes 
at a time when the state deficit is an 
estimated $10 billion. California’s 
fiscal limitations continue to threat-
en statewide plans for university 
expansion and its pledge to meet 
the growing educational demands 
of Californians.

“The state is facing significant 
fiscal constraints, which may limit 
its ability to meet all of the univer-
sity’s current budgetary needs,” UC 
Executive Vice President Katherine 
N. Lapp said in a press release. 
“Therefore, UC has a responsibil-
ity to fund other critical needs and 
investments through cost-saving 
reforms identified as part of an 
ambitious and sweeping multiyear 
restructuring initiative.”

Lt. Gov. and Regent John 
Garamendi told the Associated Press 
he was skeptical of the budget’s reli-
ance on students as a backup plan.

“I think we’re making a very 
serious mistake,” he said.

Concerned about widespread 
student opposition and deficient 
state resources, Garamendi wanted 
the budget proposal to exclude any 
reference to a fee increase. 

However, the majority of regents 
rejected his recommendation, opt-
ing to include the provision in the 
event that the governor’s state bud-
get proposal in January would fail to 
meet the university’s fiscal needs.

Despite the criticism, UC 
President Robert C. Dynes said the 
budget proposal is a necessary step 
to increase the university’s capacity 
for quality education.

An Alternative to Parking on Campus

MIKE CHI/GUARDIAN
In an effort to increase campus sustainability, UCSD’s Parking and Transportation Services will replace 20 of its current shuttles with alternative-energy hybrid vehicles by 2010.

As officials from UCSD 
Transportation and Parking Services 
continue to stress the importance of 
safeguarding the environment in 
their agenda, one of the depart-
ment’s next steps will involve con-
verting the campus’ diesel-powered 
shuttles to hybrid engines.

UCSD’s current bus fleet will be 
replaced with shuttles powered by 
alternative energy and compressed 
natural gas, which could cost as 
much as $500,000 to $750,000 per 
bus. Ten buses will be replaced in

in testing requirement.

2009, followed by 10 more in 2010. 
“We are still studying emis-

sion benefits,” said T&PS Assistant 
Director Charles Kindred. “So we 
don’t, at this juncture, know the full 
reduction in emissions. But, CNG-
fueled buses are cleaner-burning, 
use cheaper domestic fuel and are 
quieter.”

T&PS urges students to use 
alternative forms of transportation 
to further reduce gas emissions. 
This priority reflects the depart-
ment’s adherence to the university’s 
environmental policy, Kindred said. 
In the past six years, the number of 
people entering campus in single-
occupancy vehicles has decreased 
by 12 percent, dropping from 66 
percent in 2001 to 54 percent in 
2007. Additionally, five shuttles 
were cut from the department’s fleet 
last year, which, coupled with the 
decline in single-occupant usage, 
eliminated 200 tons of gas emissions 

from the environment, according to 
T&PS.

Surveyors stationed at campus 
entrances count the number of 
commuters entering campus and 
track their mode of transportation. 
According to a 2007 T&PS report, 
more than half of the 46,249 people 
entering campus on a representa-
tive day drove their own cars. Ten 
percent of commuters traveled in 
shuttles, 22 percent used carpools, 
6 percent rode buses, 5 percent were 
pedestrians, 2 percent were bicy-
clists and 1 percent used vanpools.

“We hope to reduce the sin-
gle-occupant vehicle percentage to 
below 50 percent within the next 
three to five years,” Kindred said.

The increase in permit prices 
helped fund new parking structures 
and technology such as Hopkins

Board Delays Vote on UC Chancellor Wage Increase
By Reza Farazmand
Senior Staff Writer

A proposal to increase UC chan-
cellor salaries by up to 17 percent 
next year was delayed from consid-
eration by the UC Board of Regents 
last week. Originally scheduled to 
take place on Nov. 8, the meeting 
to review and vote on the increase 
was postponed to January to allow 
the regents to obtain more detailed 
information.

According to UC Office of the 
President spokesman Paul Schwartz, 
the regents said they would need 
more information from the sub-
committee in charge of the pro-
posal before they could come to a 
decision.

“They wanted to know the cri-
teria that the increases were going 
to be made on, how the increases 
were going to play out in the sub-
sequent years, and how they were 
going to be dealt with in the context 

of total compensation,” Schwartz 
said. “The regents asked that the 
proposal be filled out with more 
information and be brought back 
in January, so it’ll be back on the 
January agenda.”

If implemented, the proposal 
would increase the salaries of the 10 
UC chancellors by as much as $70,000 
each. UCSD Chancellor Marye Anne 
Fox, who currently makes $374,000, 
could see a salary increase of up 
to $63,000. Additionally, subsequent 
increases would be implemented 
over the next three years, eventu-
ally bringing chancellors’ salaries to 
market level.

The proposal, designed to sharp-
en the university’s competitive edge 
in the hiring of top-ranking offi-
cials, stirred up controversy when 
it was announced last week. While 
university officials claim that such 
salary increases are necessary in 
order to attract top talent and com-
pete with other highly ranked insti-

tutions, dissenters felt the proposal 
comes at an inappropriate time.

Among those opposed to the 
proposal is state Sen. Leland Yee 
(D-San Francisco), who has been 
openly critical of the university’s 
executive payment practices in the 
past. According to Adam Keigwin, 
Yee’s communications director, 
more prominent univerity-related 
issues overshadow the need for 
chancellor salary increases.

“In light of the current bud-
get situation, in light of the fact 
that student fees continue to be 
increased, in light of the fact that 
the UC workers, the rank and file 
workers, the janitors, the faculty 
members aren’t being given a liv-
able wage or a fair wage, executive 
compensation packages are com-
pletely uncalled for,” Keigwin said.

University officials maintain 
that pay increases are crucial in 
order to keep up with market-level 
competition, pointing to the fact 

To increase greener 
transportation options, 
department plans to 
integrate hybrid fleet 
into shuttle system.

UC Board of Regents 
approves budget that relies 
on $70.5-million state 
grant to avoid increase in 
student fees.

UC Chooses VP for 
Research, Grad Studies
The UC Board of Regents 

appointed Steven V.W. Beckwith, 
director of the Space Telescope 
Science Institute and professor of 
physics and astronomy at Johns 
Hopkins University as the UC vice 
president for research and gradu-
ate studies on Nov. 15.

Effective Jan. 1, 2008, Beckwith 
will act as the senior UC system-
wide research officer responsible 
for long-term graduate education 
planning, outreach and recruitment, 
coordinating planning for new 
graduate programs and identifying 
and developing responses to major 
research initiatives.  

The new position was approved 
by regents in May after review by 
an academic committee for the UC 
Office of the President and entails 
networking with industry, state and 
federal governments and promot-
ing university positions on research 
policy issues.  

As director of the Space 
Telescope Science Institute from 
1998 to 2005, Beckwith was 
responsible for overseeing approxi-
mately 600 people conducting 
research activities for the Hubble 
Space Telescope, as well as for the 
distribution of more than $25 mil-
lion annually in research funding. 

“UC is the pre-eminent public 
research university in the world, 
and I am deeply honored by this 
appointment,” Beckwith said in a 
press release. “It is the best-posi-
tioned university system to create 
major scientific advances through 
multicampus cooperation, and I am 
very much looking forward to work-
ing with the regents, administration, 

faculty, staff and students to help 
advance UC’s tradition of excel-
lence in the forefront of research 
and graduate education.”

Philanthropy to University  
Tops Billion-Dollar Mark
Private financial support for UC 

system’s 10 campuses reached 
nearly $1.3 billion over the past 
year, making it the seventh con-
secutive year that contributions 
from individual alumni, charitable 
foundations, corporate sponsors 
and other friends of the university 
topped the billion-dollar threshold, 
according to Nov. 15 report from 
UC officials.

“The University of California is 
a great public university, and this 
sustained support from private 
donors across the state is powerful 
testimony to, and recognition of, 
the essential contributions that the 
University makes to the economic 
prosperity and quality of life of all 
Californians,” UC President Robert 
C. Dynes said in a press release. 

Charitable foundations donated 
the largest portion — $526 million, 
an increase of more than 12 per-
cent over the previous year — while 
alumni support reached a record 
$193 million, and corporations 
totaled $211 million.

As a result, the university was 
able to add $280.5 million to its 
endowment fund, making it the 
second largest among the nation’s 
public universities.  

Of the $1.3 billion, UC campus 
foundations received $619.3 mil-
lion, doubling the amount donated 
10 years ago. The UC system’s 
2006-07 budget was approximately 
$18 billion.

evaluating student learning.
In turn, the nine undergradu-

ate universities within the UC sys-
tem refused to participate in the 
College Portrait project. However, 
Dynes said the university plans to 
consider adopting some aspects of 
College Portrait, such as including 
data about graduation and reten-
tion rates and information about 
graduate programs. 

College Portrait’s second compo-
nent, the student and family infor-

mation section, includes standard 
statistical and demographic infor-
mation, as well as an application 
called the College Cost Calculator. 

The application asks prospec-
tive students basic questions about 
their family’s income, the number 
of their siblings attending college 
and other factors that will help pin-
point the amount of aid for which 
they qualify. Based on such infor-
mation, the system will estimate 
the cost of attending a particular 
university.

Additionally, this portion of 
College Portrait also includes the 
Student Success and Progress Rate 
feature, which aims to provide an 
alternative process to the current 
federal graduation rate, according

able for their students’ learning and 
progress. 

College Portrait’s structure con-
sists of three sections: student and 
family information, student experi-
ences and perceptions and student 
learning and outcomes. 

The most controversial category 
within College Portrait is the stu-
dent learning and outcomes por-
tion, which requires universities to 
administer a standardized test to 
100 freshmen and seniors. 

The two-part testing require-
ment provides data from state 
licensure examinations and other 
program assessments, which will 
show prospective students’ passage 
rates for these exams and measure 
students’ cognitive skills through 
one of three standardized tests.

The exam would be adminis-
tered during their freshman and 
senior years, in order to measure 
students’ critical thinking skills and 
track their learning gains. 

In an attempt to combat con-
cerns over the testing, the devel-
opers intend to allow colleges a 
four-year period to develop the 
best testing requirement for their 
institution. In this time period, 
participating colleges and universi-
ties may choose to not reveal their 
test results. 

Despite these efforts, the testing 
component remains highly conten-
tious. The UC system has been 
especially concerned, with UC 
President Robert C. Dynes express-
ing his qualms about the required 
standardized testing in a letter to 
the organizers of College Portrait. 

“[The testing] fails to recognize the 
diversity, breadth and depth of disci-
pline-specific knowledge and learning 
that takes place in the colleges and 
universities today,” Dynes said. 

Dynes also said the testing 
requirement would undermine the 
role of the faculty and campus in

to data from the National Student 
Clearinghouse.

The UC system has already 
launched an interactive Web tool 
called StatFinder that allows stu-
dents to search through a variety 
of admissions data. By mid-2008, 
StatFinder will provide prospective 
students with graduation and reten-
tion rates, along with statistics on the 
performance of enrolled students. 

Like College Portrait, 
StatFinder’s goal is to increase the 
transparency and accountability 
of higher education institutions, 
according to a UC Office of the 
President press release. 

The UC system’s refusal to join 
the College Portrait database, how-
ever, has not hindered its popular-
ity among other colleges. Since the 
program’s unveiling, the 23-cam-
pus Cal State system, 16-campus 
University of North Carolina sys-
tem, 9-campus University of Texas 
system, and 13-campus University 
of Wisconsin system — along with 
the University of Iowa and the 
University of Tennessee — have all 
expressed their intent to participate 
in the project.  

David Edelson, NASULGC 
associate director of public affairs, 
said the UC system’s absence from 
College Portrait is not integral to 
the project’s success.

“There is enough participation 
that it will not affect the national 
goals of the project,” he said. 

Edelson said colleges and universi-
ties would likely adopt a system simi-
lar to that of College Portrait. 

Currently, the program is await-
ing approval by the American 
Association of Colleges and 
Universities, which will meet some-
time this week. If the project is 
approved, institutions will be able 
to officially sign up to participate.

Relief Now, an advocacy group for 
California college students, filed 
a ballot initiative with California 
Attorney General Edmund G. 
Brown, Jr. to freeze tuition fees for 
UC and California State University 
tuition for the next five years. The 
legislation would also limit future 
fee increases from exceeding the 
inflation index.

“Students are taking the brunt of 
state lack of funding, so the admin-
istration continually puts funding 
on the backs of students when they 
can’t even afford that,” SFTRN Lead 
Organizer Valeria Fike-Rosales 
said. “They’re pushing students out 
of the higher education system.”

In order to fulfill its high-prior-
ity needs, the university has heavily 
relied on continuous state funding, 
which in the early 1990s under-

“This budget is a roadmap for 
turning vision into action,” Dynes 
said in a press release. “The vision 
is to meet the growing and changing 
needs of California. With adequate 
funding support, we can turn that 
into action by building and main-
taining the quality of UC’s teaching 
and research core; bringing UC’s 
research and educational capacities 
to bear in health care, research and 
K-12 education; and restructuring 
the way UC does business.”

While its proponents argue that 
the budget would accommodate 
the growth of the state’s college-
aged population and the developing 
needs of Californians through its 
provisions for research and edu-
cation, it would also result in $3 
million in wage raises for 245 top 
university executives: a 5-percent 
salary boost on average.

The Board of Regents’ compen-
sation committee also considered 
increasing chancellors’ salaries by 
one-third, though the decision was 
not finalized within the budget pro-
posal. 

Before the proposal vote, stu-
dents voiced their alarm to the 
board about potential fee hikes. 
Several students protested out-
side the regents’ conference room, 
advocating a push to stop tuition 
increases through the legislative 
process.

went a significant reduction due to 
strained state resources. The UC 
system has yet to receive repara-
tion for the cuts, and faces the 
continual challenge of satisfying the 
ever-growing demands of the state’s 
economy.

As a result, student fees have 
risen significantly over the years. 
Fees for UC undergraduates now 
average $7,400 annually. 

Fike-Rosales said proponents of 
the budget proposal are placing too 
much faith in its ability to improve 
higher education through higher 
student fees.

“There is this argument that 
they need to maintain the quality of 
higher education, which is why they 
continue to raise student fees,” she 
said. “But as they are raising fees, 
they are cutting classes, and students 
are not receiving a high quality of 
education. That is eventually going 
to impact the economy, because 
we’re not getting the workforce we 
need. Our economy depends on 
higher education.”

While the regents have not offi-
cially voted on a student fee hike, 
the university will require a long-
term commitment of the state to 
execute its budget plan. Adjustments 
to the plan will be made follow-
ing the governor’s January budget 
proposal.

last year — from 1,295 people arriv-
ing via transit in Winter Quarter 
2006 to 2,717 people in Winter 
Quarter 2007.

“We believe this large increase 
reflects the fact that UCSD now 
subsidizes many MTS and NCTD 
bus routes leading to the campus 
to the extent that members of the 
campus community can ride for 
free,” Kindred said.

In 2006, the university imple-
mented the “Sustainable Fleet 

Management Plan” by purchasing 
223 electric and 32 hybrid vehicles, 
wiping out more than 70 metric 
tons of carbon emissions and 97 
percent of sulfur emissions.

Despite student criticism 
that available parking spaces are 
extremely rare, the department 
reported that there are approxi-
mately 1,400 empty parking spaces 
during peak times on a daily aver-
age.

“The demand is satisfied,”

matic vehicle location system that 
was installed in each shuttle over 
summer. T&PS reduced the num-
ber of shuttles as it partnered with 
San Diego’s Metropolitan Transit 
System to reroute bus lines in the 
free bus zone. 

About 1,000 drivers shied away 
from on-campus parking, avoiding 
purchasing a permit last spring in 
comparison to the previous quarter. 
T&PS Director Brian d’Autremont 
said that this ultimately “saved the 
university an entire parking struc-
ture” in addition to Hopkins, which 
would have increased permit prices 
again.

Although the 2.5-percent hike in 
permit prices is the lowest increase 
the department has seen in a decade, 
the number of purchases continued 
to decline, with another 400 cars 
leaving the parking system this fall.

“If anything, we’re trying to dis-
courage people from buying per-
mits,” d’Autremont said at a Nov. 6 
parking forum. 

He added that one major change 
to help preserve the environment 
was lowering the number of campus 
shuttles. The shuttles must oper-
ate at a minimum of 70-percent 
capacity, otherwise the lack of pas-
sengers makes the shuttle’s contin-
ued operation unreasonable, con-
sidering the campus’ commitment 
to the UC Policy on Sustainable 
Transportation Practices.

Campus shuttle ridership has 
remained relatively stable in the 
past four years. Public transit use, 
however, increased by 110 percent 

that is not satisfied.”
However, some students have 

said parking’s rising costs counter-
act the diminished availability of 
convenient parking.

“I have to pay more than $500 
for a parking permit just to ride 
on an overcrowded bus for 20 min-
utes to get to my class,” Eleanor 
Roosevelt College senior Sarah Yee 
said. “It doesn’t make sense.”

T&PS also plans to lessen the 
appeal of single-occupancy vehicles 
through a regional transit pass that 
would allow students and UCSD 
employees to use any form of pub-
lic transportation, including buses 
and rail, within 15 miles of campus. 
The goal of the passes, which will 
be available in 2009, is to facilitate 
the commute to campus via public 
transit. 

“We don’t currently have addi-
tional details on the program as we’re 
in preliminary discussions with the 
various transit agencies throughout 
San Diego County to develop this 
program,” Kindred said.

Rideshare operations provide 
other forms of alternative transpor-
tation with various incentives for 
commuters who take advantage of 
its programs.

The Transit/Coaster Club, for 
example, offers the free use of on-
campus Flexcars, discounted transit 
passes and a complimentary occa-
sional-use parking permit for those 
who purchase a monthly transit or 
coaster pass.

university’s need to set itself apart 
from other universities in its com-

“While our students and our 
faculty are certainly comparable to 
Harvard, Yale and other universities,

ment is compared to that of other

be considered in the process.

“There’s been no real justification 
for these salary increases,” Keigwin 
said. “The methodology that they 
use is incredibly flawed. They only 
look at salaries of comparable uni-
versities. They don’t look at all the

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA — 
Constantly in a state of disarray, the 
UC Board of Regents appeared even 
more tousled than usual last week 
during its meetings. Between the 
unexpected and unexplained resig-
nation of outspoken Regent John J. 
Moores and talk of possibly boost-
ing chancellor salaries, the regents 
found themselves under fire once 
again — and, as always, for very 

good reasons. 
In what was an extremely close 

call last Thursday, the regents post-
poned a decision to raise the 10 UC 
chancellors’ salaries more than 30 
percent over the next four years. But 
despite tabling the final decision 
until January, the board’s misstep 
was no less apparent. 

In another harrowing display of 
its closed-door attitude, Californians 
were reminded of the scandals that 
shook the university in 2005 only 
to find that little has changed since 
those troubling days. 

The regents are still pushing to 
hike salaries behind California’s 
back, as students and parents state-
wide bear the cost of ever-increas-
ing tuition fees that fund their pric-
ey choices. 

The regents, along with high-up 
UC executives, preach about the 

need to remain competitive in the 
market to attract future faculty, but 
the facts speak otherwise. According 

to an independent report commis-
sioned by the university with Mercer 
Human Resource Consulting in 
2005, total compensation for senior 

UC officials like campus chancellors 
was comparable and competitive 
with market levels. 

So while salaries for executives 
may lag when compared to private 
universities like Yale and Harvard, 
hefty above-base-pay rewards 
coupled with medical benefits and 
cushiony retirement plans more 
than make up for any disparity in 
salaries. 

But, of course, those reaping the 
benefits would like us to think oth-
erwise. And some, UCSD Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox specifically, brush 
off the scandals entirely. 

“The only thing scandalous 
about it is the salaries for faculty, 
staff and administrators here are 
very low compared to other places,” 
Fox said of the 2005 compensation 
matters.

Attitudes like this, however,  

reflect the administration’s neglect 
of students’ needs, as the salary 
increase is likely to be accompanied 
by a 7-percent increase in student 
fees systemwide. According to the 
recently approved UC budget, stu-
dents can expect fees to soar once 
again unless the state provides an 
astounding $70 million in added 
finances for the system. Given the 
state’s multibillion-dollar deficit, 
odds are definitely against the stu-
dents. 

But executive fumbles did not 
stop there. 

During last week’s meetings, the 
regents also approved an exorbi-
tant salary for departing university 
President Robert C. Dynes, who will 
return to UCSD (after a year-long 
sabbatical) as a physics professor 

Although usually I try to keep this column light-hearted and funny, a num-
ber of events that occurred over the 
past weekend have pushed me to 

actually be serious for a moment, 
because I’ve realized that there are 
still a surprising amount of idiots 
out there who need schooling on 
party manners.

Picture that little illustration 
embedded in my column text (I’m 
not that weird-looking in real life, 
I swear) getting furious, yelling at 
people — mostly strangers but some 
friends, male and female, skinny 
and fat — running around my own 
house like a crazy person and act-
ing like an all-around bitch, just 
because several of my party guests 
were too inconsiderate to behave 
like actual human beings.

But before I start explaining 
proper party etiquette, I need to 
give you a little bit of background 
information. 

It all started with an idea for 
a grand theme party: animals vs. 
robots. My roommates and I have 
thrown multiple theme parties 
before, but I have to say that this 
was, by far, the most original idea 
we’ve had. 

So, excited about this innovative 
theme, we made a Facebook event 
explaining the dress code, which, in 
very simple English, stated to come 
in costume as an animal and/or 
robot. 

As anyone who has come to 
one of our parties knows, we don’t 
expect extravagantly crafted cos-
tumes made from imported Chinese 
silk. 

But seriously, for a theme like 
this, all you needed to do was wrap 
some tin foil around your arms or 
wear some stupid cat ears on your 
head, and you would have been

LOCAL NEWS — While some 
of-age San Diegans will kick and 
scream about the new one-year ban 
on alcohol at all San Diego beaches, 
the ordinance will serve its pur-
pose in helping recreate San Diego’s 
image as a safe, family-friendly town 
that welcomes all to its calm, sunny 
beaches. 

Since the ban is only limited 
to a one-year trial, it still leaves 
the door open for future booz-
ing. Although Councilman Kevin 
Faulconer wished to impose a per-
manent ban on liquor consumption 
at local beaches, the compromise 
of a one-year ban will provide both 

sides a year full of statistics and 
interpretations that will yield more 
definitive answers. 

Even though it seems like the 
San Diego City Council has only 
voted to postpone an eventual deci-
sion on the divisive issue, this is an 
important step; it is one that shows 
more action on the council’s part 
than their previous two decades of 
complacency. 

 The problem of alcohol presence 
on public beaches was first brought 
up in 1991, when the council voted 
in favor of a similar one-year ban. 
However, the council was forced 
to withdraw the proposal because 
opposing local business owners 
and community members gathered 
enough signatures for a referen-
dum. 

It was evident at the time that the 
issue was not as pressing, because 
instead of having their resolution go 
to a public referendum, they con-
ceded and did not go forward with 
the trial ban on alcohol. 

Since the early 1990s, alcohol 
consumption and parties on local 

beaches have grown exponentially. 
Rowdy beach scenes culminated this 
past Labor Day, when a drunken 
melee broke out and riot police were 
required to subdue the intoxicated 
crowd. 

After the dust had settled, 15 
people had been arrested — seven 
of whom were underage — and San 
Diego was given a tarnished image 
all over the national media. 

Given the circumstances, the 
city council felt the need to make 
some substantial change, and City 
Attorney Michael Aguirre eventu-
ally stepped up with the passed trial 
ban.

It is a shame that the average 
beachgoer won’t be able to crack 
open a cold beer or two on a sunny 
Sunday afternoon at the beach, but 
this law has not gone into effect to 
curb this display of serene, non-
threatening drinking. Instead, the 
ban’s overarching goal is to re-inject 
a sense of sanity and civility into the 
three biggest party days of the year 
on San Diego Beaches: Memorial 
Day, the Fourth of July and Labor 

Day.
In 2006, the estimated number of 

people in Pacific Beach and Mission 
Bay on July 4 was upward of 200,000, 
and whenever that large of a popula-
tion (with large amounts of alcohol) 
is condensed into such a confined 
area, violence easily occurs. 

Since San Diego beaches are pop-
ularized as prized vacation spots, 
this year’s holidays will most likely 
still be heavily attended, giving San 
Diego lawmakers a perfect control 
group for comparing statistics. 

The councilmembers can only 
hope that news of their alcohol ban 
does not spread quickly beyond San 
Diego. The ban will only provide 
accurate statistics if the same num-
ber of people show up at the beaches 
as usual, a fact contingent on non-
local partygoers still coming to San 
Diego and not changing their holi-
day plans to allow for heavy drink-
ing.

lion people crowded on the beaches,

with a salary of $245,000. He will 
be the second-highest-paid profes-
sor in the UC system and will also 
receive $405,000 for his yearlong 
break. 

The decision, however, sends 
a frightening message to Dynes’ 
future replacement — poor manage-
ment and an equally poor perfor-
mance pay off, big time. Remember, 
it was under Dynes’ leadership that 
millions of dollars in unapproved 
compensation were gifted to the 
university’s top executives. Dynes, 
of course, went unpunished.

These actions are a slap in the 
face to the overworked and under-
paid union workers who contribute 
so much to the everyday operations 
of the university. 

Many of the regents are trying 
to justify their swelling salaries 
by reminding citizens that earli-
er this year, the university agreed 
to increase staff-worker salaries. 
However, the union worker raises 

are laughable in comparison to the 
compensation hikes the chancellors 
would see if the regents approve the 
$3 million proposal in January, as it 
appears they will. 

Custodians and clerical employ-
ees only saw their salaries increase 
between 0.5 and 2 percent. The 
chancellors, however, would see 
increases of 33 percent over the 
next four years: between $40,000 

and $70,000, the same size as the 
total salaries of many unionized  
workers.

This decision and the seemingly 
impending increase in chancellor 
salaries are especially disconcerting 
given the efforts of state legislators 
to revamp the system and protect 
against future payouts without public 
approval. 

Hopefully Jan. 1 will mark a dra-
matic change in the approval process 
for similar decisions. Under a new 
bill authored by state Sen. Leland Yee 
(D-San Francisco), the regents will be 
forced to hold open meetings for all 
talks involving executive compensa-
tion taking effect in the new year. 

If the bill is effective and the pub-
lic seizes the opportunity to hold the 
regents accountable, the new year 
could also mark the start of a changed 
board finally putting an end to the 
days of administrative fouls.

good to go. 
However, when people com-

pletely ignore directions and show 
up without following the dress 
code, not only do they come off as 
incompetent and annoying, but I’m 
not letting them in (unless I person-
ally really like them and they have 
an amazing excuse). 

If I catch you without a costume, 
I’m going to ask you leave, and no 
amount of begging is going to save 
you. 

I understand that you might get 
angry, but ultimately it’s your own 
fault. Simply put, if you can’t fol-
low the theme, don’t go to a theme 
party, bitches.

Here’s some advice for those 
token non-costumed flaming het-
erosexual bro guys who somehow 
end up at every party: Screaming 
the word “faggot” at the hosts 
just because we happen to be gay 
doesn’t really do anything to help 
the situation. 

(And honestly guys, can’t you 
think of something more creative?)

Moving on: Why the hell would 
anyone throw trash, rocks or gar-
den pots in the pool? (Yes, some-
one actually did that.) Last time 
I checked, swimming holes aren’t 
synonymous with your personal 
wastebasket. 

Unless that’s changed, I don’t 
understand why people would act 
like seventh graders and throw their 
empty beer cans and cigarette butts 
in the water.

Another particularly heinous 
party foul resulted in a broken a 
mirror, and I’m not talking about 

some dumb little bathroom look-
ing glass. We have floor-to-ceiling 
mirrored sliding closet doors in 
our hallway, and in a matter of sec-
onds, some clumsy, drunk fat-ass 
knocked into them and shattered 
the whole pane — and then ran 
away like a pansy bitch.

I collected about $90 toward a 
repair fund, but Mr. Anonymous 
Asshole should really have manned 
up to pay for his mistake. Who runs 
around crashing into glass anyway? 
Obviously, only someone who needs 

a serious lesson in party etiquette 
would rage his way into hundreds 
of dollars of entirely preventable 
damage.

The stupidity didn’t stop there. 
Apparently, two star-crossed (read: 
beer-goggled, because I saw both 
of you naked and I definitely wasn’t 
impressed) lovers thought my bed was 
the perfect place to get their freak on. 

First of all, why would anyone 
think it would be acceptable to 
enter one of the host’s bedrooms, 
let alone remove all their clothing 
and get into the host’s bed? That is 

so beat. Did you not think I might 
come into my own room at some 
point during the night? Show a 
little class and at least move it to 
your car.

Finally, the last major qualm I 
had was the fact that people from 
Board Club threw flyers all over 
our house advertising their events. 
Do that on your own time, people. 
Don’t trash my house. 

I’ve gone to Board Club events 
in the past and actually had a lot of 
fun, but littering is where I need to 
draw the line.

I’m not even getting into the fact 
that someone threw up everywhere 
in the bathroom except the toilet, or 
that some asshole thought it would 
be a good idea to hide a teddy bear 
in the back of our oven (fire hazard 
from hell). Or that someone ripped 
down one of the lanterns we had 
in our backyard. Or that there was 
a clump of smelly black puree in 
our kitchen sink drain. (If anyone 
knows what that was, please let me 
know. I won’t be mad, just curious.) 
Come on, people. Parties happen 
for one night and I really did want 
everyone to have fun, but I still can-
not grasp the fact that some of you 
completely disrespected my house. 

At the end of the night, my 
roommates and I still have to live 
there. That’s why it’s called a house 
party. It’s at someone’s house. In the 
match between animals and robots, 
it seems the pigs unfortunately won. 
After this, I’m not sure I ever want 
to have another party again. And 
that’s a damn shame, because sans 
the destruction, they’re pretty fuck-
ing awesome.

6  OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 2007

only a few hundred arrests might 
seem comparatively insignificant, 
but what the hordes draw more 
than anything is attention from 
local police. 

On these celebrated beach days, 
San Diego must divert the majority 
of its police force to patrol the sur-
rounding beaches and attempt to 
maintain order. Since the beaches 
are not the only local areas vis-
ited during these raucous holidays, 
the likelihood of serious problems 
beyond the coastline is dangerously 
high. 

The city has concluded that 
at these high-risk events, an ade-
quate police force would consist of 
one officer for every 50 civilians; 
the same ratio used at San Diego 
Chargers football games. 

Having 4,000 armed police 
patrolling up and down San Diego’s 
beaches would pose a huge logisti-

cal problem and be inconvenient for 
both beachgoers and officers. 

Of course, even with the alcohol 
ban in effect, police will continue 
to monitor the beaches and keep 
order when necessary, but now the 
police department can distribute 
its resources where they are more 
directly needed. 

As with any law, this alcohol 
ban will not eliminate 100 percent 
of drinking, but it will hopefully 
cut down on the amount of binge 
drinking that occurs on San Diego 
beaches. Now, if somebody is dar-
ing enough to break the alcohol ban 
and drink on a San Diego beach, 
they are most likely going to drink 
in extreme moderation to avoid 
being arrested. 

Having a regulation on the 
books that curtails drinking will 
be a big enough deterrence to keep 
dangerous binge drinkers off local  
beaches. 

One particular demographic that 
will be devastated by this ban is the 
local Over the Line faithful. The 
popular San Diego beach ballgame 
has gained a large following over 

the last decade, drawing over 50,000 
eager spectators for the official 2006 
tournament. 

The game, which pits two teams 

of three players against each other, 
is a combination of baseball and 
softball that serves as a perfect lei-
sure sport to allow for liberal alco-
holic consumption while providing 
enough action to satisfy thrill-seek-
ers. With the alcohol ban, Over the 
Line will now have to be played 
sober, a prospect that will sure-
ly persuade many players to stay 
home, drink a few beers and watch 
a football game instead.

This year-long ban will try the 
patience of more than a few San 
Diegans and might even hinder 
some of the city’s commercial rev-
enue. 

However, a year of beaches with-
out alcohol will have its benefits. It 
will be a great way for San Diego 
to understand the true effects of 
combining liquor and beaches. And 
then, if after a year the evidence 
concludes that there was no differ-
ence in crime rate or beach safety, 

then councilmembers will reexam-
ine the necessity of the law and most 
likely allow alcohol on beaches once 
again. 

But if the statistics produced 
by this ban show conclusive evi-
dence that removing alcohol from 
the beaches drastically improves the 
area’s overall livelihood, then the 
ordinance will have fulfilled its goal 
to provide enough groundwork for 
future regulations to maintain the 
safe and healthy atmosphere created 
during the year-long ban. 

Reality can have a very sober-
ing affect on people, and hopefully 
a year of forcing people to realize 
that the pristine San Diego coastline 
and beaches can be fully enjoyed 
sans alcohol will be the most effi-
cient hangover cure for the city as a 
whole.

THE STUDENT OUTLOOK
FOCUS

I
t’s Monday morning, and as most people 
gear up to spend a day at work, UCSD 
lead custodian Freddy Serrano prepares 
for his whole week. He says goodbye to 
his family in Riverside County at 5 a.m. 

to make his 7:30 shift, knowing that he won’t 
see them again until the weekend. He works 
nine hours at UCSD followed by a graveyard 
shift for the San Diego Unified School District 
and — running on empty — returns to his car, 
where he tries to get a few hours of shuteye 
before restarting the process.

“It affects our togetherness,” Seranno said 
of his job’s impact on his relationship with his 
family. “I can’t see them in order to make ends 
meet, to send my kids to college and to pay for 
extra expenses like their own cars … it affects 
me a lot.”

He carries a cell phone at work to check 
in with family members and learn 

what’s going on in their lives while 
he is away.

This is Seranno’s real-
ity, along with that of 

many other UC 
service work-

ers, which 

includes custodians, food servers, cooks, bus 
drivers and groundskeepers, who have to work 
two or more jobs just to earn a living wage. With 
gas prices soaring and the increased prevalence 
of people living further from work, “It’s useless 
to go home and then come back for a second 
job,” Seranno said.

T h e 
vast majority 
of UCSD service and patient 
care workers commute from 
Chula Vista, El Cajon and 
National City, said lead organizer 
for the American Federation of State, County 
and Municipal Employees Local 3299 Celine 
Perez. Others trek from Riverside County or 
cross the border from Tijuana to work at the 
university. The two largest ethnicities are Latino 
and Filipino workers, many of whom are immi-
grants.

Seranno is a 19-year UCSD veteran that 

was born in the Philippines. He said he remem-
bers a time when the university was so small 
he could count its buildings. Serrano is one of 
the many employees doing the unglamorous 
but imperative work of maintaining the campus 
and creating the environment that students and 
faculty experience every day. Though Serrano 
has witnessed drastic changes on the campus 
over the years, he can’t say the same about his 
paycheck. After almost two decades of service, 
he gets paid $30,000 a year. 

Senior custodian Antonio Campos moved 
to the United States from the Philippines five 
years ago, hoping for better employment to sup-
port four kids overseas. After 18 years waiting 
for his green card, he now lives alone in Mira 
Mesa, working at UCSD by day and as a pizza 
deliveryman by night to send a monthly check 
to his family.

According to a wage analysis titled “High 
Ideals, Low Pay,” completed in 2005 by the 
National Economic Development and Law 
Center, UC senior custodial wages lag 15 
percent behind those of the California State 
University system and 26 percent behind 
community colleges. Additionally, the uni-

versity maintains a “range pay system” where 
employees may be paid anywhere from $8 to 
$15 an hour without defined starting rates or 
set wage increases. 

AFSCME President Lakesha Harrison said 
the current system is arbitrary and that the 
union wants a “longevity step system,” in which 
all UC employees would start at a specified 
salary and receive automatic wage increases at 

Late-night snacking, Ben and Jerry’s by the pint and three pizzas for $15 at Domino’s  — all of these are contribut-ing factors to the infamous “freshman 15.” But a little 
extra weight is only one aspect of what makes college life so 
hard. Challenging course loads, peer pressure and being 
away from home for the first time all add to the college 
student’s daunting life. With all the activities, parties 
and new people to meet and impress, there’s little to 
wonder why a teenager might get self-conscious. 

“With eating disorders, the whole problem is body 
image,” said Tim Hong, a Thurgood Marshall College 
alumnus and political science major. “But I think it’s 
more than that. I think it has to do with the control 
factor. With an eating disorder, you have control over 
at least one aspect of your life, even when all the other 
things are out of control.”

According to the National Eating Disorder 
Association, eating disorders and purging behaviors 
occur in as many as 25 percent of college-age women 
and as many as 10 percent of college-age men. Without 
treatment, 20 percent of people suffering from eating 
disorders will die from the effects.

“Bulimia often starts in the early 20s,” said Elise 
Curry, program manager at the UCSD Eating 
Disorder Clinic. “Whenever you have a bunch of 
20-somethings together, that’s the population where 
you are going to see a significant amount of people 
with bulimia. You start to see anorexia around 14, 
and if that goes untreated sometimes it can lead to 
bulimia. Someone starts off as an anorexic, they 
never get treatment, go off to college and their 
disorder just gets worse. There aren’t very many 
obstacles for an eating disorder in college.”

There are two main types of eating disorders: 
anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. Bulimia is diagnosed 
when person eats a significant amount of food (binges) and 
then attempts to stop weight gain by either vomiting (purging) 

or using a laxative. Anorexia occurs in people who fear gaining weight so 
intensely that they avoid food and stop eating altogether. 

Female students often find themselves surrounded by people who are 
smaller and skinnier than they are. For a lot of these students, college is the 

first time that they can starve themselves without anyone else noticing. 
Male students have a similar problem. They see people who have more 

muscle, and work out twice a day to build the perfect body. 
Hong developed bulimic tendencies while at UCSD by 

overexercising to the point that his body started 
to give out. 

“I was running 20 to 30 miles every week,” 
Hong said. “I got to the point where I had to 
work out and then I started throwing up after-
ward, which complicated things. In one summer 

I lost 50 pounds. I went from 200 to 150. I used 
to lift a lot of weights, so it was like going from one 

extreme to the other.”
Hong exercised to the point that his knee cartilage 

wore down heavily, and his doctors told him to stop 
abusing his body.

“But I couldn’t stop running,” Hong said. “And even if 
I did stop, I would swim for three or four miles every day 

instead. When I figured out that I needed to get help, 
I actually vomited blood up. It wasn’t a ton — but it 
wasn’t a little either. It was right before Christmas, and 

my chest hurt for about a week. Every time I breathed, 
every time I laughed, coughed, anything, my chest would 

hurt. That’s when I realized I could be doing permanent 
damage.”

Hong sought help through a friend in the psychiatry program who knew 
a therapist at the UCSD Eating Disorder Clinic. With her referral, Hong 
started the program to recover. 

About two years ago, UCSD recruited Curry to start a new on-campus 
eating disorder program. She came from a four-and-a-half-year service at 
the Sharp HealthCare, one of the leading medical service providers in San 
Diego County, where she also created an eating disorder program from the

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 2007 THE UCSD GUARDIAN FOCUS  9

“Giza,” we told the driver, piling into 
the cab in front of Alfred Megally’s apart-
ment building. It was Nov. 4, and I was 
still sporting my handlebar mustache 
from Halloween. Wearing black skinny 
jeans, a brown leather belt studded with 
Iron crosses and a tight yellow T-shirt 
reading “Arts Connection,” I felt even 
more out of place than I had five days 
earlier.

Megally, a University of Massachusetts 
marketing major who spent the first 
seven years of his life 
in Cairo, was dressed 
in maroon running 
shorts and a gray fleece 
pullover. A comical 
bright red headband 
holding back the ever-
expanding afro of 
black hair barely stole 
attention from his 
equally trashy handle-
bar mustache. Joining us in our adventure 
was fellow study abroad student Becca 
Brenneis, in a classy, bright blue skirt and 
touristy brown cowboy hat with black 
stitched zigzags rounding the brim. Her 
white shirt was decorated with the cast 
of Peanuts: Woodstock, Snoopy, Charlie 
Brown, Lucy and the rest of the gang. We 
were off to visit the pyramids, hoping to 
take the best holiday greeting card pho-
tos ever — mocking tourism in our best 
fashion. 

We were nearing the edge of Cairo 
half an hour later; the Giza plateau lifted 
the pyramids above the city skyline ahead 

of us. An Egyptian teen hopped onto 
our taxi’s trunk and as Brenneis and I 
exchanged glances, he shouted toward 
the driver.  It took nearly five minutes 
of back-and-forth yelling in Arabic from 
Megally for our new passenger to leave us 
on our journey alone.

“What was that all about?” I asked.
“He wanted to show us around the 

pyramids,” Megally explained, laughing. 
Our cab driver fended off another eager 
guide by telling him we were going to the 

hotel next to the pyra-
mids’ entrance. After 
paying the student rate 
of 25 Egyptian pounds 
and passing through the 
gate, our situation rapid-
ly deteriorated. Hardly a 
moment went by where 
we weren’t repeating 
“no thank you” to offers 
of desert camel rides, 

guides or photo requests.
Making the mistake of snapping a 

quick picture — eagerly requested by a 
Bedouin on his camel — I was followed 
for five minutes while desperately try-
ing to shake off the demand for “bak-
sheesh,” or tips. Furiously turning away, 
my unfriendly pursuer instantly changed 
his mood as he approached a family of 
British visitors with his camel whip in the 
air. “Mister, mister, one picture please,” he 
called again, his round cheeks lifted over 
a toothy smile. 

As we snapped photos, posing fool-
ishly and laughing hysterically, a trend 

started to become apparent: We weren’t 
being noticed or gawked at by other 
tourists. We weren’t drawing attention. 
Dressed in Bermuda shorts and brightly 
colored polo shirts, wearing foolishly 
huge sunglasses and safari hats, fellow 
tourists passed without a second glance. 
Old men in tall cowboy hats and women 
with pink, sunblock-covered noses posed 
for family photos, fashion and style of 
little concern.

Tourists of all nationalities and ages, 
dressed in all manners of attire from 
absurd to chic, pour through the gates 
each day. The monuments draw more 
than five million tourists to Egypt annu-
ally, a figure that continues to rise. 

This past summer, a worldwide vote 
held at the prompting of Swiss business-
man Bernard Weber selected the new 
“Seven Wonders of the World.” The Giza 
pyramids, the only remaining Ancient 
Wonder of the World, did not earn a place. 
Egyptologists protested, prompting the 
United Nations Cultural Organization to 
issue a statement emphasizing it had “no 
link whatsoever” to the Weber’s online 
vote. Nevertheless, the exclusion of the

No Strings Attached 
at Off-Center Che Cafe

From the outside of the Che Cafe 
on a Tueseday night, the venue looks 
inconspicuous. Located on the hill 
leading up to Revelle College, only a 
handful of cars are parked outside. The 
sole source of light that illuminates the 
scant parking lot comes from the inside 
through a few small windows and one 
main door on the left of the shack-like 
building.

Inside the Cafe’s mural-covered 
walls, however, David Bowie songs 
float through the venue while a few 
regulars wait for the show to start. 
Some are having deep conversations, 
some are studying and in the back are 
several guys leaning over the counter, 
chatting with the volunteers who are 
cleaning up the kitchen. 

But not everyone is there yet. At the 
large worktable, scarred with graffiti 
and plastered with bumper stickers, sits 
Kira Roessler, former bassist of punk 
band Black Flag. Roessler, along with 
her Dos bandmate Mike Watt, are at 
the Che Cafe this Tuesday evening for a 
scheduled show with Capillary Action 
and Joe Lally of Fugazi. The latter two, 
however, are running late because they 
are stuck in Los Angeles traffic.

Though Roessler had never heard 
of Che Cafe before being scheduled 
to play there, the mood she feels from 
simple tea-sipping and Bowie-listening 
sums up the Che’s attitude. 

“[It’s] not playing by the rules, but 
here it is: doing the best we can, put-

ting it together on your own. It has that 
kind of anti-corporate feel to it — ‘I’m 
gonna do it the way I wanna do it and 
not conform to what anyone else says,’” 
Roessler said. 

Despite it being her first time play-
ing at the Che, Roessler’s assessment 
isn’t far from the truth. This indepen-
dent, volunteer-run, on-campus venue 
does not have a leadership hierarchy of 
any kind, just a group of people — both 
students and nonstudents — who col-
lectively decide how to run operations. 
Anyone can take part in this decision-
making process by attending collective 
meetings on Thursdays at 8:30 p.m. 

This democratic process has its ben-
efits. Members can do things the way 
they want and see the fruits of their 
labor. According to David Diekmann, a 
nonstudent volunteer: “Shows depend 
on who goes to the meetings and book 
the shows. Whoever listens to hardcore 
punk or indie pop will choose what 
kind of shows they want to see.”

Che’s interior illustrate the legacy of 
previous bands that have played there. 
Bumper stickers on the Che’s wooden 
panel walls advertise for bands such 
as the Lisps, Rat City Robot and Claire 
de Lune. Even mainstream bands such 
as Green Day and Cursive have graced 
the Che in the pas, according to Dana 
Dahlstrom, who graduated from UCSD 
in 2007 and is currently a graduate 
student. 

Though Che members are proud-
about its culture-rich past, they still

defined intervals. Unlike the current 
method, the step system would enable 
upward mobility and provide fair sala-
ries.

The NEDLC wage analysis com-
pared UC service-worker salaries with 
the California Self-Sufficiency Standard 
— the cost of basic family needs in the 
counties that host UC campuses and 
medical centers.

In 2004, the San Diego County 
standard was $23,934 a year to support 
a single adult. That number jumps to 
$36,730 when adding a preschool-age 
child and down to $24,816 when add-
ing one child and another adult, assum-
ing each adult has a working income. In 
2004, the average annual income for a 
UCSD senior custodian was well below 
the requirement, at $21,464. UC food 
service workers averaged $10,600.

Across the UC system, 35 percent 
of all service workers earned wages  
that inadequately meet basic needs for 
a single adult, the report said, with the 
highest percentage of workers — 58 
percent — coming from UCSD.

Ninety-three percent of these work-
ers could not support themselves and 
one child, and the percentage approach-
es 100 in larger families. The wages 
of UC food service workers are low 
enough to qualify for nine major wel-
fare programs, the report said.

“After paying for our house, our 
food and the schooling of our chil-
dren, we’re back to zero dollars again,” 
Seranno said.

These figures have sparked a slew of 
demonstrations and protests over the 
past three years, including a one-day 
strike in April 2005. 

The California state Legislature 
announced in July 2005 that it had 
allocated $8.5 million from the 2006 
state budget for custodial pay increases, 
but it wasn’t until spring of 2007 that 
the money was released.

“Even after UC got money in their 
budget, they didn’t spend it on workers 
until we made them,” Harrison said.

Last April, all AFSCME-repre-
sented employees and members of the 
Coalition of University Employees who 
earned less than $40,000 a year received 
a 0.5- to 2-percent raise. In addition, 
custodians from UC Berkeley, UCSB 
and UC Santa Cruz received some of 
the state-allocated money in the form 
of $1.75 hourly increases, while custo-
dians from other campuses obtained 
raises of 50 cents per hour.

UC service workers received their 
final contractual raise last October, 
which boosted salaries by 4.5 percent. 

However, despite recent increases, 
wages are still behind market levels, 
and the issue remains critical to the 
union’s negotiators, AFSCME bargain-
ing team member Jessica Agost said.

Along with gaining market wages, 
current bargaining efforts center on 
health care and pension protection, 
according to Agost. The union has met 
with the university on several occasions 
to present proposals and counterpro-
posals to no avail. 

On Nov. 9, AFSCME arrived at 
UC Davis to find that the room they 
had reserved for bargaining had been 
given to another group. The workers 
held their caucus in the parking lot and 
waiting room instead, but considered 
the university’s conduct to be disre-
spectful, Agost said.

Another meeting was scheduled 
Nov. 15 at UCSD, but UC chief nego-

tiator Michelle Lee refused to meet 
because of the number of students 
present. About 115 people showed up, 
half of which were student observers, 
Agost said.

Considering the low wages and 
thick politics tied to working for the 
UC system, it’s difficult to understand 
why employees continue working. 

For senior custodian Antonio Bujo, 
the answer is simple — UC offers good 
benefits. Bujo works at UCSD half-
time, which is just enough to receive 
the health care and pension benefits of 
a full-time employee. The UC pension 
plan has historically been funded solely 
by the university, and employees only 
pay roughly half the cost of monthly 
health care premiums. The health care 
plan also covers children while they are 
in school, a requirement which Bujo 
needs for his children. 

Others workers, such as food ser-
vice worker Lamont Morris, enjoy their 
student co-workers.

“I haven’t had a bad day with the 
students yet,” Morris said.

Serrano also reported a fondness 
for the students who live in the Sixth 
College apartments where he works. 
He recalled an apartment of students 
who asked Seranno and another cus-
todian to come over to cook and eat 
chicken adobo, a soy and vinegar dish 
typical of the Philippines.

These are the things that keep work-
ers going, whether it’s the company of a 
fellow employee, the friendliness of a 
student or the phone call of a distant 
relative who they work hard to sup-
port. 

Bujo upholds three core values in 
his work — the requirements of suc-
cess according to the proverb by which 
he lives.

“Success is highly dependent on a 
combination of hard work, intelligence 
and honesty,” Bujo said. “If one is miss-
ing, it’s not success.”

remain humble about its function. In 
the past, according to Dahlstrom, the 
Che held firmly to a nonracist, non-
sexist, nonhomophobic policy, and 
refused to allow bands to play — even 
if they attract a crowd — if they had 
these tendencies.

Though the store does not have 
formal core values, Dahlstrom said 
Che members recognize the left-lean-
ing philosophy drawn from the cafe’s 
revolutionary namesake.

“It’s a trend that 
nobody can deny,” 
Dahlstrom said. 
“But there’s too 
much of a percep-
tion on the UCSD 
campus that Che 
espouses some sort 
of extreme view-
point. People who 
have heard about 
the Che heard that 
they’re commu-
nists or something. 
Whatever they say, 
it’s not true. There 
isn’t a single Che dogma or anything 
everyone has to believe in. Every single 
question you ask will be a different 
answer from someone.”

Though beliefs may vary from 
member to member, everything they 
do is volunteer-oriented with a do-it-
yourself approach — the core reason 
for the cafe’s existence and inner work-
ings. 

In addition to hosting either a con-
cert or a film series on Tuesday nights, 
the Che holds all-you-can-eat dinners 
serving vegan food at either $3 or $4 
a plate, cooked completely by volun-
teers. That particular night’s special 
was pesto pasta, with all its ingredients 
donated. Txus Zubia, another nonstu-
dent volunteer, came in at 3 p.m. that 
afternoon to help cook for those who 

come to the Che for dinner. 
Dahlstrom, Diekman and Zubia 

unanimously agreed that the best 
donation the Che receives is not any 
piece of equipment or furniture, but 
the time that volunteers contribute. 

“Obviously, we can’t run without 
volunteers,” Dahlstrom said. 

In addition to being part of a col-
lective effort, volunteering at the Che is 
also a haven for those who are new to 
the area. Thurgood Marshall College 
junior Taylor Hunter is a transfer stu-

dent who has 
volunteered at 
the Che for a 
quarter. 

“I came from 
Long Beach and 
didn’t know any-
one, so I came 
[to the Che] to 
meet people,” 
Hunter said. “I 
have fun cook-
ing and talking. 
Even cleaning up 
is fun.” 

Zubia moved 
to San Diego from Mexico and knew 
almost no one in the area. The Che’s 
appeal drew him to San Diego, espe-
cially when Against Me! played at the 
Che five years ago. He now volunteers 
there full-time. 

Roessler admires that the Che acts 
as a kind of alternative hideaway. 

“Especially for kids out of town, 
they are looking for a place,” Roessler 
said. “A lot of people don’t fit in a part 
of the school. I went to UCLA and I 
was part of Black Flag. The sorority 
girls would always stick their noses up 
at me. It gives people somewhere to 
go, especially in college where things 
feel strange.”

ground up.
“We opened our doors here 

about two years ago,” she said. “We 
started with two patients and we 
haven’t been closed since. We have 
a lot of UCSD students, and people 
from the community. People with 
anorexia and bulimia are beginning 
to find us, but I don’t think people 
on campus really know, so I’m look-
ing forward to having that.”

Apart from the eating disorder 
program, UCSD students have a few 
other options. Psychological and 
Counseling Services provide free 
therapy for students. They also have 
a body-image discussion group that 
meets weekly to discuss problems 
that college stu-
dents face with 
accepting their 
bodies. Both 
options deal 
with students 
who have slight-
ly less severe 
problems. But if 
a student purges 
more than twice 
a day, psycho-
logical services 
will refer them 
to the eating dis-
order program.

“We have people from across 
the country [at the program] who 
couldn’t make it in college,” Curry 
said. “It completely interrupts their 
college experience. But if they are 
UCSD students then they might 
be able to come here and stay in 
school, and that’s what we try to 
do with them. Our program meets 
only in the afternoon and evening 
hours. A lot of UCSD students try 
to put their classes around this, 
so hopefully they can get through 
the program and still go to school. 
Sometimes they have to take a 
smaller load, but it usually works 
out.”

The eating disorder program 
has a 12-week session, and accepts 
about 10 patients per session. The 
patients go through sequences of 
group therapy, meet with a dietician 
and a therapist, practice meditation 
and goal-setting, eat group meals 
and do family therapy, among other 

things.
Psychiatry professor and Eating 

Disorders Program Director Walter 
Kaye has done research that indi-
cates there may be a gene linked to 
anorexia. 

“We try to cut down [the behav-
iors] slowly,” Curry said. “It doesn’t 
help with bulimia to say to quit 
now. They’ve been doing it for a 
long time, and they aren’t just going 
to stop. It takes about 20 different 
skills to replace one eating disorder. 
That’s how powerful these things 
are.”

After the program, patients 
are given a discharge plan and are 
encouraged to meet with a thera-
pist for at least a year. According 

to Curry, the 
average recovery 
time for people 
suffering from 
eating disorders 
is about seven 
years. Of the 
people who seek 
treatment, about 
a third complete-
ly recover, while 
another third 
relapse and the 
rest don’t recover 
at all.

Patients in the 
eating disorder program at UCSD 
do find comfort in one another, and 
keep each other accountable even 
after the program is over. Hong 
is still involved with his aftercare 
group, and he has learned from his 
experiences.

“Looks aren’t everything they’re 
cracked up to be,” Hong said. “I’ve 
been in both positions. I’ve been 
really fat, and I’ve been really skin-
ny. I’ve been normal too. I think the 
reason that guys do it is to attract 
girls, but girls really don’t care that 
much about it as guys think they do. 
People need to learn how to become 
cool with themselves. Those are the 
people who are happy. There are 
tons of people that I know that are 
ripped and everything who aren’t 
happy people. I’ve learned that I 
would rather just be happy.”

Campus Program Helps  
Improve Student Health

pyramids in the new World Wonders 
list is not expected to hamper tour-
ism. Neither are the frustrations of a 
day trip to the site. 

The nonstop onslaught of ped-
dlers preying on tourists is one of the 
biggest qualms from the millions of 
visitors to the pyramids. Complaints 
online are numerous; pyramid 
reviews are often laden with harsh 
criticism complaining about tourist 
traps, unhelpful guides, lackadaisi-
cal police and the constant ambush 
of touts — those adept at scamming 
foreigners. Brenneis and Megally had 
similar sentiments. 

Brenneis, who spends time horse-
back riding at the Sakkara pyramid 
site (a smaller and less known site 17 
miles south of Giza) said the differ-
ence between the two is drastic. 

“The Giza pyramids are a tourist 
trap because everyone has heard of 
them. The Sakkara pyramids are a 
great place to frolic in the desert with 
butterflies,” she said. “The Sakkara 
pyramids are what a trip to the pyra-
mids should be … Tourist sites in 
Egypt are more of a way to extract 
money out of tourists than national 
monuments.”

“Persistent camel guides stole 
the magic of the moment,” Megally 
added with a smile.

Another damper on a trip to the 
pyramids is the 4 p.m. closing time. 
White uniformed tourist police herd 
out wandering visitors who are still 

snapping photos. For after-hours 
views, some choose a camel ride to 
the distant, “panoramic” viewpoint.

More adjusted to Egypt’s ways, 
the three of us chose a third option. 
Kindly thanking each officer who 
approached us and pleading for just 
one more minute, we continued to 
wander for an extra hour. Eventually, 
the pyramids cleared, the officers 
left, the touts headed into the city 
or out to the viewpoint with herds 
of camel-riding tourists. The pyra-
mids settled into an eerie, deserted 
silence.

Contrasted against the city, the 
pyramids began to take on an orange 
glow. The sunset reflected off the yel-
low, five-thousand-year-old blocks 
of stone. Satisfied with our photos, 
we finally headed across the des-
ert sands alongside the pyramids 
and out the gates. Stepping onto the 
street, I felt foolish again. People 
stared. 

In a few days Megally’s friends 
and family will be opening holi-
day greetings cards, and staring 
back will be a handlebar mustache, 
a cheeky grin and an afro framed 
by an outrageously bright red head-
band. Looking through his photos, 
Megally let out a booming laugh as 
he declared, “That’s awesome; we 
look so ridiculous!”

14 SPORTS THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 2007

middle blocker Sylvia Schmidt, who 
recorded five aces in the first game in 
addition to her five kills.

Game two saw much tighter com-
petition, with the Vikings taking the 
early lead but the Tritons coming 
back to storm ahead 22-15. UCSD 
then found itself in a dogfight late, as 
Western Washington University pulled 
within one point to 25-24. Bailey got 
the offense powered up again with a 
pair of kills to give the Tritons a com-
manding lead.

There is no explicit reason for the 
Tritons’ late-game collapse. Maybe 
UCSD ran out of gas from playing so 
many five-game matches during the 
past week; maybe they lost focus hold-
ing such a big lead. Or maybe the 
Vikings decided to play the kind of vol-
leyball that earned them a conference 
championship and a No. 2 seed.

Black was surprised at the momen-
tum shift and said the Tritons had 
played well in the first two games.

“I was feeling pretty good after those 
first two games,” Black said. “They were 
two of the best games we have played 
all season. We executed our game plan 
but I think our mentality changed and 
we began playing on our heels.”

Whatever the case, Western 
Washington came alive during games 
three and four, nursing its early leads 
for wins. It used an 11-3 run to close 
out game three after the Tritons had 
pulled close, trailing 18-20. In game 
four, it was UCSD that made a run to 
try to steal the game, but the Tritons 
faltered and came up short. 

Once again in a decisive game five 
situation, the Tritons were confident 
that they could rebound from two poor 
games to take the match. Early on, it 
looked like they would do just that 
when they took an 11-8 lead and forced 
Western Washington University to use 
its timeout.

But the team was again plagued by 
costly errors at the most inopportune 
moments, as three straight UCSD hit-
ting errors gave the Vikings an 11-13 
lead. A kill from senior outside hit-
ter Casey Wilson pulled the Tritons 
within one, but it just wasn’t enough as 
Western Washington University closed 
the curtain on UCSD’s season.

According to Ries, the loss was 
tough to swallow, as the Tritons had 
their sights set on an NCAA title.

“We’re really used to winning the 
fifth game,” she said.  “It was especially 
tough losing because it was so close and 
it was in the regional.  For us seniors, it 
was an emotional ending.  Those were 
the last points of our college volleyball 
careers and the sadness was just over-
whelming.”

Nonetheless, Ries was content with 
her team’s efforts and said Western 
Washington was a strong opponent.

“We went out hard and you can’t 
ask for anything more than that,” Ries 
said.  “We had a series of calls that 
didn’t go our way and a few errors.  
They got on a run and we just couldn’t 
stop them.”

The loss caps an impressive 20-8 
season during which the Tritons saw 
their share of struggles and success. 
Despite losing eight games, UCSD only 
suffered back-to-back losses once dur-
ing the course of the season. Perhaps 
the one real weakness of this team was 
its inability to close out games with late 
leads, and this flaw proved to be its 
downfall in the playoffs.

As disappointing as the exit from 
the NCAA tournament may be, Black 
is still proud with the way the team 
performed all season.

“There are a lot of coaching cliches 
that I’ve begun to understand since 
starting here,” Black said. “These girls 
have shown me that if you really want 
something and you work hard, you can 
achieve it.”

No. 21 Tritons End Title Run in 
Round Two of  NCAA Tourney

▶ VOLLEYBALL, from page 16

Daniel Perdew, Todd Langland and 
freshman Brandon Maryatt also fin-
ished second with a time of 1:26.04.

In individual performances, 
junior Kendall Bohn took third 
in the 100-meter breaststroke and 
improved her time from last week 
by almost three seconds to 1:06.81. 
Sprinter Perdew notched two third-
place finishes with a time of 21.52 in 
the 50 freestyle and a mark of 47.29 
in the 100 freestyle.

According to senior Ryan Kloos, 
the Tritons were well aware of the 
challenges facing them as they took on 
formidable opponents, and viewed the 
meet as preparation.

“The Santa Barbara meet is always 
a hard meet because they are faster 
than us, but it’s good to get practice 
against that kind of team before [the] 
Nike Cup,” he said. “[The] Nike Cup is 
one of our main meets of the year.”

Panis agreed, saying that the Tritons 
were not too concerned with the losses. 

She highlighted the team’s hope that it 
would swim faster in Long Beach.

“This meet was an opportunity 
to tune up our racing strategy,” she 
said.

The Nike Cup gave the Tritons 
the chance to test if their challenges 
against UCSB and Cal Poly had proved 
beneficial. UCSD battled against 
some tough competition, including 
Stanford University, Brigham Young 
University and the U.S. Air Force 
Academy, and proved they were up to 
the task, finishing seventh and eighth 
overall in the women’s and men’s 
competitions, respectively.

Shimura had some of the team’s 
best performances, finishing third 
in the 200 backstroke with a time 
2:03.60, sixth in the 100 backstroke 
with a finish of 57.70 and seventh in 
the 50 freestyle, finishing in 24.08. 

For the men, Perdew touched the 
wall fourth in the 50 freestyle and 
swam a 20.34 in preliminaries.

The relay teams also placed well 

at the meet, with the women’s 400 
medley relay of Shimura, Bohn, 
sophomore Karla Holman. and 
Deters finishing fourth with a time of 
3:52.68. The men’s 200 freestyle relay 
of Perdew, senior J.P. Oliver, Maryatt 
and Langland also finished fourth in 
their race with a mark of 1:23.78.

Panis, who finished sixth in the 
women’s 200 backstroke, said that the 
team was very excited about its per-
formance at the Nike Cup and con-
tinues to look forward to  nationals.

“This was a good meet,” Panis 
said. “It got people qualified for 
nationals, which is always a big goal 
we have for Nike Cup. People swam 
really well and placed high.”

With these two meets under their 
belts, the Tritons will have plenty 
of time to recover and prepare for 
their next challenge, the University 
of Nevada, Las Vegas Diving 
Invitational beginning on Dec. 15, 
followed by the Redlands Diving 
Invitational on Dec. 16.

Force, they can get in your face,” 
sophomore utility Sean Roberts 
said. “I think that’s what happened 
in the first half. We let our guard 
down for a little while.” 

The Tritons were led in scoring 
by Garcia and junior driver Chance 
Vermilyea, who each scored three 
goals for the team. 

UCSD answered back from a dis-
appointing loss to Air Force with a 
win the next day against UC Santa 
Cruz. 

“We took the fire from the out-
come of the Air Force game and put it 
forth on Santa Cruz,” Roberts said. 

The Tritons’ fire was evident from 
the beginning of their game against 
UC Santa Cruz as UCSD put six goals 
on the board in the first quarter. The 

Tritons took a 10-3 lead into halftime 
and put the game away with five unan-
swered goals in the third period.

The Tritons spread the ball on 
offense, with 11 different players 
scoring in the contest. Garcia, senior 
driver Curtis Williamson, sophomore 

two-meter defender Steven Donohoe, 
Roberts, Vermilyea and senior driver 
Ben Miller all had multiple scores in 
UCSD’s win.

“Everything was clicking [against 
UC Santa Cruz] and we were working 
real well together,” Roberts said. “Santa 
Cruz couldn’t swim with us on offense, 
and on defense everyone on the team 
played a really solid game.”

By scoring 10 goals in UCSD’s 
three games to lead his squad, Garcia 
was the sole Triton named to the All-
WWPA Tournament team, earning 
him first-team honors. 

Loyola Marymount University 
took the WWPA Championship game 
over top-seeded UC Davis by a score 
of 7-6 on Nov. 18. Loyola Marymount 
lost its three previous games against 
UC Davis this season.

the Tritons battled on the boards and 
refused to let four blocked shots from 
the Aztecs hurt their confidence or 
aggressiveness in attacking the basket.

Down five with over nine min-
utes left in the half, Patterson worked 
his way inside for another lay-up. On 
UCSD’s next possession, senior guard 
Clint Allard rebounded a blocked shot 
and passed it off to sophomore guard 
Jordan Lawley, who hit a jumper, drew 
a foul and converted the free throw to 
tie the score at 18 
with 8:14 left to 
play.

Coming out 
of a timeout with 
6:46 in the first 
half, UCSD again 
trailed, 20-18, and 
the Aztecs turned 
up the intensity 
with full-court 
pressure on the 
Tritons. After a 
near turnover, an 
Aztec foul gave 
the Tritons the 
ball at mid-court. 
Junior center 
A.J. Maulhardt 
tipped an offensive rebound to sopho-
more forward Andrew Browning, who 
found Lawley for a three-pointer that 
put the Tritons back on top 21-20 with 
6:02 left to play. One of two free throws 
by SDSU senior Matt Thomas tied the 
game, but junior guard Kelvin Kim got 
UCSD into the penalty with 5:17 left in 
the game and knocked down the first 
of a one-and-one to put the Tritons 
ahead again, 22-21. Unfortunately, it 
would be the last lead for the Tritons 
in the half, as SDSU scored five straight 
baskets and went into the break ahead 
36-27.

Despite the deficit, the Tritons 
played well in the opening half, nearly 
doubling their first-half output from 
the two team’s previous match-up and 
keeping close to a Division-I squad that 
has made the postseason two straight 
years.

“We competed hard and for a half 
and we out-rebounded a very, very 
good team,” Carlson said. “That’s an 
NCAA Tournament team. I really 
believe that.”

The Tritons pulled down 18 boards 
in the first half over the Aztecs’ 16, and 

Carlson praised his team’s ability to 
compete with a formidable squad.

“Our effort was there,” he said. 
“Even when we were a step away or just 
didn’t react the right way or even when 
we missed shots, I thought we were 
executing for the most part.”

The Tritons again struck first in 
the second half, scoring the first three 
baskets on a layup by Patterson, jump-
er by Allard and layup by Lawley to 
pull within one possession at 36-33. 
Unfortunately, a three-pointer, steal and 

an alley-oop slam 
by the Aztecs put 
the lead back to 
eight, the closest 
deficit the Tritons 
would have during 
the second half.

Despite being 
unable to regain 
the lead, the 
Tritons responded 
to the Aztec offense 
throughout the sec-
ond half, trailing at 
most by 18 before 
the final score of 
76-60, which rep-
resented a 20-point 
improvement from 

last season’s 84-48 loss at Cox Arena. 
UCSD also limited the Aztecs to their 
fewest points in a game between the 
two teams since their 2003 meeting, 
and the Tritons scored the most points 
against SDSU since the teams’ second 
meeting in 1981.

Carlson was happy about the 
Tritons’ showing against the Aztecs but 
said the team is already looking for-
ward to its next game.

“I tell these guys all the time, ‘You 
play how you practice,’ and we had a 
great week of practice,” Carlson said. 
“For us it’s all about getting back to 
work on Monday, trying to have a good 
week of practice, and try and perform 
well against a good Grand Canyon 
team next Saturday, which is a regional 
game for us. It’s a huge game.”

After a 1-1 exhibition season, 
UCSD’s regular-season record now 
stands at 0-1 with its next game on the 
road against Grand Canyon University 
on Nov. 24 at 7 p.m. The Tritons open 
their conference schedule at home on 
Nov. 30, hosting Cal State Stanislaus 
with a 7:30 p.m. scheduled tip-off at 
RIMAC Arena.

HOT CORNER

Senior Staff Writer

The women’s volleyball team has 
become very accustomed to playing 
five-game matches during the recent 
weeks, and as winners of four of their 
last five five-game regular season con-
tests, the Tritons were prepared for 
the pressures of the NCAA Division II 
Pacific Regional.

As the No. 3 seed, UCSD took care 
of No. 6 Northwest Nazarene University 
on Nov. 15 in the opening round 23-30, 
30-25, 30-25, 26-30, 15-13. Fresh off 
another five-game melee, the Tritons 
forged ahead with thoughts of a return 
to the NCAA Division II finals, but No. 
2 Western Washington University gave 
UCSD a taste of its own medicine, end-
ing the Tritons’ title hopes 23-30, 26-30, 
30-21, 30-26, 15-13.

Against Northwest Nazarene 
University, UCSD held leads in games 
one and four, squandering both with 
crucial late errors. In game one, the 
Tritons led 21-20 before the Crusaders 
went on a 9-2 run to take the game. 
Junior outside hitter Rebecca Bailey 
led UCSD in games two and three, 
overpowering the Northwest Nazarene 
defense and scoring 12 of her 30 kills 
during the two games. 

Game four was tied at 24-24 before 
a pair of service errors handed the 
Crusaders the game and forced a fifth. 
In the final game, UCSD jumped to 
a 4-2 lead after another Bailey kill. 
The lead was stretched to 13-10 when 
the Crusaders made one last stand. A 
Nazarene kill and Triton hitting error 
later, UCSD called a timeout. 

“I just tried to keep them calm,” 
head coach Tom Black said. “My main 
goal was to keep them focused on the 
task at hand and not let their minds get 
too far ahead.”

UCSD came out sharp and did what 
it had done all season: win game five. 
Bailey tallied another kill, and senior 
opposite Amber Ries finished off the 
match. It wasn’t a pretty win, but come 

playoffs, a win is all that matters to 
move on to the next round.

“That was the best game someone’s 
played against us all year and we still 
found a way to win,” Black said. “Our 
serving was nonexistent but our pass-
ing and hitting was great. It’s really a 
testament to the character of these girls 
and shows how committed they are.”

So used to being on the winning 
side of five game matches, the UCSD 

players found themselves in a differ-
ent position on Nov. 16. The Great 
Northwest Athletic Conference cham-
pion Western Washington University 
looked vulnerable in games one and 
two as the Tritons played solid vol-
leyball to take a 2-0 lead. In game 
one, UCSD built a 26-16 lead behind 
the serving and hitting of sophomore

The No. 14 UCSD men’s water 
polo team, which won the Western 
Water Polo Association champi-
onships last season, took fifth in 
this year’s conference tournament. 
The Tritons won the fifth-place 
game against No. 20 University of 
Redlands by a score of 14-8 on 
Nov. 18 to end their season. UCSD 
opened up the tournament with a 
tough 11-10 loss to No. 16 U.S. Air 
Force Academy to put the Tritons 
in the consolation bracket. There, 
UCSD went on to win 19-6 against 
UC Santa Cruz on Nov. 17 to propel 
the Tritons into the game against 
the Bulldogs, finishing with a 12-17 
record for the season. 

In the Tritons’ final game, both 
teams played a tight first quarter, 
matching each other goal for goal. 
UCSD scored the game’s first three 
goals, but the Bulldogs answered 
with three of their own. 

With the game tied, the Tritons 
picked up the pace in the sec-
ond quarter, scoring five goals to 
Redlands’ one to give them an 8-
4 lead heading into halftime. The 
Tritons extended their lead by out-
scoring the Bulldogs 4-2 in the third 
quarter, almost cementing their 

win. 
Leading the way on offense for 

UCSD were sophomore two-meter 
Daniel Garcia and junior driver Jeff 
Hunt, who each scored three goals 
during the game.

The Tritons lost a close 12-10 
game earlier in the season against 
Redlands, giving them extra motiva-
tion to pick up the win.

The first game of the WWPA 
championships in Colorado for the 
Tritons pitted the No. 4 seed UCSD 
against the No. 5 seed U.S. Air Force 
Academy. 
The last 
time the 
two teams 
p l a y e d 
each other 
was Sept. 
1, when 
the Tritons won a nail-biter by a 
score of 15-14. But this time the 
Falcons dictated the outcome.

The Tritons fell behind early in 
the game as they were outscored by 
Air Force 4-2 in each of the first two 
quarters, but they launched a come-
back in the second half, scoring 
three goals in the third quarter and 
only allowing one score from the 
Falcons. UCSD erased its first-half 
deficit near the end of the fourth 
quarter, tying the game 10-10 with 
less than one minute left in regula-
tion. Air Force responded on its 
ensuing possession with a goal to 
deal UCSD the 11-10 loss.

The men’s basketball team opened 
its regular season at Cox Arena on Nov. 
17 against cross-town Division I foe 
San Diego State University. Playing in 
front of 6,706 fans — the largest home-
opening crowd for San Diego State 
University since 1999 — the Tritons 
proved they could at least compete with 
the Aztecs, but eventually fell 60-76.

Leading off with a three-pointer 
by junior forward Darryl Lawlor and 
ahead 9-4 early on, the Tritons con-
trolled the opening-period tempo, hit-
ting the boards to limit SDSU’s sec-
ond-chance opportunities and working 
the ball around in search of the best 
shot. The Aztecs would not tie the 

score until 12:23 in the first half, taking 
their first lead with 11:45 remaining 
on a layup by Aztec forward Ryan 
Amoroso. However, junior forward 
Henry Patterson would respond for the 
Tritons with a layup of his own on the 
other end, tying it up again at 13. 

Tritons head coach Chris Carlson 
said he was satisfied with his team’s 
early efforts.

“We did the things we wanted to do,” 
Carlson said. “We contested every shot 
pretty well. We boxed-out, rebounded 
and for the most part we took care of 
the ball. That allowed us to execute 
some things offensively and get some 
open shots, which we made.”

then trekking to Long Beach from 
Nov. 15 through Nov. 17 to compete 
in the Nike Cup, a huge meet with 20

mediocre showing in their first meet 
against the Gauchos and the Mustangs, 
they had several great performances at 
the Nike Cup.

Although the Triton teams expected 
a challenge from the Division-I UCSB 
and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo squads, 
UCSD had a particularly poor perfor-
mance, as both squads were blown out 
by the Gauchos and the Mustangs.

Although the teams lost by over 
100 points to both opponents, they had 
a few outstanding individual and relay 
performances. The women’s 200-meter
