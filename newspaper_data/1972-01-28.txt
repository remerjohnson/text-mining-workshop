Muir requirements change 
given final faculty approval 
Following intense d bate at Tuesday 's 

Academic Senate meetIng, th VCSD facu'ltv 
approved we pIng chang s In the general 
education requirements of MUir College 

The changes which now must be Implement d 
by the newly formed MUIr CUrriculum Rev iew 
Commission met with resistance at the Senate 
meeting from some faculty members who felt 
the changes would result In a weakening of the 
college's program. Dr Alfred Mahaster argued 
that it has not been demon trated that there IS 
an ovelwhelmlng need for th se change :\1ulr 
Provost John Stewart r piled that the pres nt 
requirements had not proven to b consist nt 
with the ideals of MUir College 

The lively debate lasted for about an hour 
before the faculty voted down a mollon to 
requ ire a mail ballot of the entire faculty befor 
the changes took place Stewart argued that thl 
would be improper SInce the MUir facultv 
should have a right to deCide changes In 
requirements and had done so Stewart objected 
to the additIOnal delay such a mall ballot would 
cause. 

Some faculty members also ral ed questIOns 
about the Muir CUrriculum ReView Board Dr 
Avrum Stroll said he feared that the board 

consist 109 of four. tudent. and live faeu!t\' 
memb rs might have veto power over cour "

Do I'OU recognize the'e men? They certainly hope not. The 

men pictured here are Governor Reagan 's bodyguards. 
although they prefer to identify themselves as simply " state 
police .. ' I encountered them at the C Regent's meeting 
last week in Los Angeles. where the governor appeared 
ostensibely to defend hiS 1972-73 state budget allocatIOn to 
the UniverSity of Califo rni a 

The men were standmg at some semblance of parade rest 
while gua rding the room where the governor and the UC 
Regents were ea ting lunch_ Even as the,¥ talked , their eyes 
were constantly moving. Bulges on thei r left Ide belied 
shoulder holsters. and the men intimated thev had- occasion 
to u e the guns whil e on dut~·. While they all 'dress in suits. 
they are identifiable by their trlangutar lapel pins. The 
three corners of the pin are red . yellow and green : each 
color designates a separate function . 

Some of lhe men claimed thev had worked for former

• The Del Mar City Council election Will be held on Tuesday . •

Feb. 3 Three of the five council positions are IOvolved thi s 
• year and the results of the election will determme the eouncll ·s • Low-Income Ripped-off 

By \li c h ac llJrc\\ and Jllhn Snider 
Students from low income families may soon find 

themselves having to drop out of school because of a recent reo 
interpretation of guidelines affecting Aid to Families with 
Dep ndent Children (AFDC I 

Currently, the program provides state grants to fam ilies who 
have children under the age of 21. provided they are still In 
school and maki ng passing grades. Under the expected new 
guidelines, announced by State Social welfare Director Robert 
Carleson on December 29 . 18-year -olds and older will no longer 
be considered "dependent" and therefore not eligible for 
AFDC . This means that 10,000 persons in thi s group will lose 
their grants entirely while another 19 ,000 families will have 
theirs reduced. State, local. and federal governments are 
expected to save $30 million dollars. 

Four times in the past session. bills were introduced to 
define the ag of ineligibility for AFDC at 18 rather than 21. 
The e were defea ted all four times . It thus appears that the 
admmistration is intent on circumventing the Will of the 
legisla ture. 

If they succeed. it will be at the expense of those who can 
lillie afford it. For those families who have sons and daughters 
attending state colleges, community colleges. and UC. it may 
mean having to drop out. 

The UC student lobby in Sacramento i currently in the 
process of determing how many C students Will be affected 
by this cha nge. Individual case will be most helpful to the 
lobby in presenting information to state officials . Any student 
(18-21) whose family is on AFDC is urged to contact the lobby 
annex or associated students office on hi campus 
Immediately.

Runnin' with the Blues 
Don Spellens 

Thanks to the magical ears of Glyn Johns and some beautiful 
band and orchestral arrangements by Soz Scaggs. Columbia 
has released another Fine album by Boz and Band. At first 
listen: the music sounds much too similar to that on 
" Moments " to be considered legitimate. 

But after two careful listens, my thoughts changed. Soz just 
may be the most creative blues composer -arranger-band 
leader-singer-guitar player influencing today's rock music. All 
but a few of the tunes on the album are his own compositions. 
" Moments" contains mostly blues and jazz tunes with Soz 
using Jymm Young on keyboards and Mel Martin on ax and 
flute quite extensively. Most of the tunes seem to me to be 
dominated by their riffs. That could have been due to G lyn's 
mix-down. After all, he produced the album and made it sound 
the way he liked it to sound. Soz was not satisfied with the mix. 

On 801 and BaDd, though, Glyn 's engineering is impeccable. 
There are very few, if any, mistakes. All of the musical sounds, 
i.e. Boz' guitar, George's drums, David Brown's bass (no 
relation to Santana's former bassist) , Doug Simril 's guitar and 
piano, Jymm's keyboards, with Tom Poole on trumpet and 
flugethorn, Mel on sax, and Pat O'Hara on trombone, are well 
integrated and no one musician stands out over the others. The 
listener is constantly aware of all of the players and they all do 
play well . 

The album takes in a wide range of music from Doc 
Severensen-type Las Vegas big band arrangements to country 
and western don't-leave-me-baby-or-I'll-lay-down-and-die 
blues. The best tune on the album, " Runnin' Blues" flashed me 
on turning on the TV at midnight and tuning into the Johnny 
Carson Show with his band doing a little number as they cut 
back to the show from one of these words from your local 
sponsor. I think that 's a compliment to Doc, who just happens 
to be a great trumpet player himself, because Pat's horn 
arrangement and Boz' singing and arranging are highlighted 
here. And Soz has a very pleasant voice to listen to and those 
vocals are constantly being topped-off by the Rita Coolidge 
Ensemble singing back up. 

Albums are nice, but groups are usually better in a live 
setting. Boz and Band are no exception. I'm finding it difficult 
to talk about this album in a cohesive fashion . Unfortunately. 
I'm quite partial toward Boz and Band for numerous reasons 
not really worth mentioning. so take a listen to it yourself . It 's 
Boz' best.

TOGETHER: 

"puts flowers and the ocean 
back into sex where they belong. 

Mike McKinney 
I was truly overjoyed by the experience of viewing a really 

heavy flick that finally tells it like it is. For those of you who in 
the past have found the stigma of " X" rated features 
uncomfortable. TOGETHER is a work which leaps all 
boundaries and puts flowers and the ocean back into sex where 
they belong. TOGETHER is a movie which tunes in on the 
vibrations of the now generation and attempts to bridge the gap 
of human development in the areas of sexual and interpersonal 
unions. Developed from a clinical viewpoint. TOGETHER 
successfully constructs a critical analysis of the problems 
arising from the mistake of people attempting to establish 
interpersonal awareness without first maintaining the sexual 
boundaries and potentials so necessary to all relationships . 

The true beauty of the movie lies in the true beauty of the 
movie. The photography is excellent and TOGETHER does 
offer an aesthetically pleasing visual effect, a somewhat small 
consolation for the coyness and pseudo-frankness one has to put 
up with for 93 minutes (count 'em>. 

The "Edcational Aspects" of the movie openly deal wi th ." 
uh ... wee wees and too toos ... but this comes across as so 
much ... uh ... cacao Thus, we have a cinemagraphic failure as 
far as content is concerned. but a visual treat (hubba hubba) 
which we strongly suggest you see with your wife, girlfriend.

Will Rogers, USA 

" 

Ever since James Whitmore began coursing up and down the 
country last season, doing his one-man show " Will Rogers ' 
U.S.A., .. critics and audiences have been throwing their hats In 
the air with enthusiasm over his how that's coming to the 
Civic Theatre on Monday, Jan . 31st at 8:30 p.m. 

Whitmore, with what seems undue modesty. says all the 
praise hasn 't been for him .. o. no, " he says, " it's that 
Americans still love that honest-Injun. hrewd philosopher. 
rope-throwmg Will Rogers. People too young ever to have een 
him have maybe seen his movies on the late shows. Or mayb 
the legend of him has come to them from their parents and 
grandparents ... 

According to Whitmore. there's never been anybody lIke Will

Coaches Spar

The UCSD mat mon ters 
wrestled their way to a victory 
and a lie in a double-duel meet 
against the niversitv of 
Redlands and San Bernardiro 
Valley College last weekend 
Th e Trit ons te rrorized 
Redlands. 39·16. with John 
Knapp. Leroy ~cNa ir. and Big 
John Duberg howlng the way 
with good bod V karma . The 
smogeatcrs or" SBVC posed 
somewhat of a problem. 
however, a thev held the 
gassed out grapplers to a 22·22 
tie 

In a previous issue of the 
TRITON TIMES, mention was 
made of the rapport between 
coach Pinkerton. ass! coach 
Bob Wilson. and the team 
members. One of the rea ons 
clled as encouraging this fi ne 
rapport was the fact that the 
coache don't put themselve 
on a mental and physica l plane 
above the athletes Out on the 
mat dunng workouts, or under 
the pressure of competitIOn. 
the responsibility that goes 
with a winning sea on I shar d 
equallv b~' the team and the 
coaches During workouts the 
coaches don't heSitate to " get 
down to It" and get sweatv 

wrestling with the team. a 
practice which ha become the 
rule this vear. rather than the 
exception' as in the past 

The wrestlers feel this is a 
big plus towards their team 
" harmony ." that Intangible 
something that inspires you to 
put out the extra effort 
competition demand . " When 
Coach Pinkerton actually gets 
on the mat with me. he proves 
to me that he knows what he's 
doing," says John Knapp, one 
of the teams' leading wrestlers 
and veteran of three seasons 
under several coaches. Leroy 
McNair. another outstanding 
performer . ag rees . " By 
wrestling With you. the coach 
can show vou vour faults bv 
using them aga inst you. it 
makes a good atmosphere to 
work out in when everyone 
helps each other ." . 

The team feels that thl 
bn ngs the coach and the team 
together by establishing coach 
Pinkerton's leader hip as a 
wre tier first rather than a 
coach "Be Ide ." says Knapp. 
" It gives YOU a chance to beat

Brain over Brawn 

Ruggers rumple Anteaters 
La t Saturday the UCSD I rugby ieam played to an easy 18·13 

victory over the tIC' Irvine Anteaters. in what has to be the 
longest rugby game ever played. Originally scheduled to start 
at high noon. the game was postponed by Irvine's inability to 
put up the goal posts, After about an hour . in which some of the 
greatest engineering minds ever to come through lrvine finallv 
figured out they were trying to put the colossal uprights in the 
wrong holes, the UCSD ruggers decided that the easiest way to 
beat UCI was to out · think them . . 

With this. the game tarted and we saw a rookie rugger. Don 
Reordan. receiving his just reward for not listening to coach 
Sertic's pep talk and thus not following the game plan, as he 
tried to use I:i s brawn on the opening kickoff. Unfortunately 
Don does not have 300 pounds of brawn where one UCI rugger 
did , and Don found himself checking the turf for bugs, with the 
UCI Anteaters on his back, Ouch ! 

After a few minutes of thi " Kill the man with the ball " we 
unleashed our secret weapon . "Try Again" Duncan, who 
proceeded to add another score to his impressive stats. "Club· 
Foot" Gates showed his usual consistencY as he missed 
another conversion (nobody told him where they finally moved 
the goal posts). Now Paul Liebow. trying to keep up with 
Dickie Duncan, lowered his head and carried half the UCI team 
across for another try. Meanwhile Gates blew another one (get 
your head out of that brown stuff. Sill ). 

By now thp fir st half had extended unto the next game and we 
were wondering why the ref forgot our fi~e · minute ·tea -and ·

brawn is better than brains blasted his way through the IrvinE 
defenses for a try , As we were coasting through the rest of the 
game with our comfortable lead. (we were now worried about 
where the party would be ). veteran coach Peter Serite 
courteously stepped aside to let the Anteaters score with 10 
seconds remaining, and as we clapped them off the field WE 
had won our second straight by a score of 18-13. 

This weekend we find our ruggers trucking off to play Lo:;ola 
in Los Angeles in a traditional grudge match. 

After suffering through the long afternoon , the UCSD II team 
finally got to play the Unicorns. some superjocks from L.A 
Whose years of experience blasted our struggling rookies 28·10 

Due to early injuries the team was forced to recruit players 
from a San Luis Obispo team that had been stranded in IrVine 
The inexoerience and lack of teamwork became increasinglv 
evident as the Unicorn stormed to a 20·to-O halftime lead. The 
Tritons' comeback effort fell far short as the game ended 28 to 
\0 and Dickie Duncan 's birthday party began.
