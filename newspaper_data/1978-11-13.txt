Dean, who was COUDIeI to 
President Richard Nixon at the 
time of the Watel'late 1CaDdal, 
spoke of biJ expel'iencea and 
the Nixon Admini.tration's 
abuse of power.

UC Abortion 
Protesters 
Gaining Force 

By Teresa Tokar 
The protests of University of 

California students against 
using mandatory registration 
fees to pay for abortions seem 
to be gaining force, despite the 
fact that the case will not go to 
trial until at least next summer, 
and that the legal costs of the 
students involved could total 
$25,000 or more by the time the 
case has ended. 

The total number of students 
protesting the abortions now 
numbers 32, as 17 additional 
students from four other UC 
campuses joined the 15 UCSD 
protesters last summer. 

Shortly after their ranks 
grew to 32, a preliminary 
hearing was held in San Diego 
by California Superior Court 
Judge Ross Tharp. Tharp ruled 
that the plantiffs in the suit 
could not be restricted to 
Catholic students. Tharp also 
ordered the University to 
an wer a complaint which 
questioned the validity of the 
UC fee structure. Under the 
present system, registration 
fees, student center fees , 
campus activity fees and 
educational fees are desig-
nated to be used solely for 
prog~ams, services and activi-
ties · which are unrelated to 
academic programs. 

The plaintiffs feel that their 
payment for abortions through 
mandatory registration fees 
violates their personal ethics 
and, in some cases, their 
religious beliefs, according to 
the plaintiffs' official court 
complaint. 

"It would be difficult, if not 
impossible, to accommodate 
this group of students and not 
accommodate any other groups 

of students who claim that a 
particular use of student fee 
money violated their religiou 
beliefs," said David Dorinson. 
a UC general counsel who i 
involved in the University 
defense. " It is the University's 

- legal position that the plain-
tiffs' religious principles are 
not being constitutionall y 
infringed upon by the use of

I an's Trouble is Everybody's Trouble 
By AInudei' Cockban 

aDd Ja_lUdpway 
PaeIae Newl8erYIee 

Despite tbe last desperate 
hope of bardline military rule in 
Iran imposed Nov . I , tbe 
conaequencea of a downfall of 
the Shah are beiDI viewed with 
horror in Wasblnlton and in 
Wall St. There is little optimism 
in either quarter for tbe 
cbance. of his lon,-term 
survival as an all-powerful 
autocrat. 

Harsh military rule marks 
the Shah's failure to ,et any 
opposition ,roup to form a 
aovemment or to participate In 
one. The Shah's announcement 
of military rule on Iran radio 
was apologetic anddefensivelo 
tone, as he conceded that most 
of the strikes were justified and 
that torture and corruption had 
prevailed. 

P a rticularly troubftng to the 
upper echelons of the US 
aovernment is the seeming 
impossibility of any effective 
interven tion . The present 
popular upsurge is very dif· 
ferent from the one in 1953 when 
less than $100,000 in CIA funds 
and a few agents headed by 
Kermitt Roosevelt could turn 
the tide against Muhammand 
Mossadegh and restore the 
Peacock Throne. The enor-
mous expansion of the officer 
corps has impeded r eliable 
intelligence on its varying 

, political aspirations, and the 
soldiers themselves are less 
likely to support the Shah. It 
should be remembered that the 
demonstrations of the last few 
months have all taken place 
under martial law. 

Wha tever the short te rm 
course in Iran. the crisis there 
has already triggered spasms 
throughout the world economy. 
Tbese include: 

- An immediate increase in 
the world price of oil, with the 
likelihood of a permanent 
OPEC hike, ratified when its 
member countries meet in Abu 
Dhabi next month. This price 
hike could speed recession in 
the industrialized countries, as 
the hike and embargo of 1973 
did. 

- A serious blow to the United 
States and the dollar. Right now 
the high price of oil rrom Iran is 

ollaet by the Sbab's bu,e arms 
purchases. mainly from U.S. 
corporations . These sales, 
which have been UDder pres-
sure for the la.t few months, 
now bani in the balance. U.S. 
ecoaomic involvement in Ir~ 
is immense. Over a quarter of 
all current arms I8lea from 
U.S. companies are earmarked 
for Iran. As of the end of 1m, 
u.s. banka held St.2 billion in 
loans to Iran, of which ,1 billion 
was due in one year or Ie ... This 
does not include U.S. bank 
loans to American corporaUons 
meetin& contracts to Iran. 

The strike by Iranian tech-
nicians in the fields of Khu-
zestan province has already cut 
the flow of crude to the shipping 
terminal on Kbarg Island from 
5.5 million barrels a day to 
700,000 as of early November. 

To put the situation in clearer 
perspective: Iran's oil output 
amounts to a little less than a 
quarter of total OPEC produc-
tion, which in September was 
near peak capacity of 32 million 

b~ rrels a day . 
The result of the shut-down is 

to shorten supply and con-
sequently drive up prices. Just 
as in 1973, it is a boon for the oil 
c ompanies who have be,en 

experienciDi a surplus. Mexi-
en, whicb baa been reportint 
lar,e reserves in recent 
montbs , was already bam-
merlq out supply qreements 
to Japan, hitherto an important 
Iranian customer. 

The supply crisia in Iran will 
last aa JoDI as the poUtical 
crisis'. Tbe oil workers in 

, 

Kbuzestan - many of them 
trained abroad and earninl 
middle cia .. incomes - are 
demandlDi poUUcal conces-
siona from the Sbab'. rectme· 
Tbey are al.o vociferou.ly 
opposed to foreip tecbniclana. 
thus readerinl it impoulble for 
the companies to risk reatorinl 
total production witb tecb-

niciana from outside Iran. 
By December the preaaure on 

Saudi Arabia to endorse a 18I'Ie 
rile in pricea,sravely undercut 
by the .Ude of the dollar, will 
probably be Irnalatible. Theae

Suez, Sinai 
Utilization 
Pact Signed 

Iranian Rioting, 
Strikes Continue 

TEL AVIV (AP) - Israeli 
television said yesterday a 
military pact being neaotiated 
in Washington will allow Israeli 
warships to use the Suez Canal 
and Egyptian warplanes to use 
one of three airfields Israel will 
give up in the Sinai Deseret 
after a peace treaty is signed. TEHRAN. Iran (AP) _ Clashes between troops and 

anti-government protesters 
claimed nine lives In Iran's oil 
belt, the Iranian news agency 
reported yesterday, and oil 
workers defied a government 
deadline for endin, their 
cripplin, 13-day-old strike. 

A key anti-government Mos-
lem religious leader, mean-
while, blamed President Carter 
for " complicating" the Iranian 
cirsis with his silpport of Shah 
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. 

The reported violence was 
the bloodiest since the shah 
appointed a military-led gov-
ernment last Monday. 

The Pars news agency said 
six persons, inclUding an army 
sergeant, were killed and 23 
demonstrators wounded Satur-
day in Khorramshahr, about 
410 miles southwest of Tehran. 

Protesters set fire to 15 banks 
and a number of shops before 
troops moved in to disperse 
them, Pars said. 

In Ahwaz, about 70 miles 
north of Kborramshar, soldiers 
shot and killed three persons 
Saturday when a group organ. 
izing a demonstration refused 
to disperse, Pars reported. 

The months-long anti-shah 
campaign has been led by 
Moslem clergymen opposed to 
the shah's westernization of 
this traditional Islamic SOCiety 
and has been joined by political 
dissidents demanding demo-
cratic reform. of his authori-
tarian rule. 

The exiled Moslem leader 
Ayatullah Khomaini, a centrai 
figure in the OPPOSition, said in 
an interview in Paris that 
Carter's " protection of the shah 
is complicating the current 
crisis in Iran." 

The oil workers launched 
their strike Oct . 31 amid 
swelling opposition to the 
shah's rule . They a lso de-
manded a 22.5 per cent pay 
hike, which was approved by 
the shah last week in a bid to 
prevent the collapse of the oil 
industry. But as bloody rioting 
continued througQout the 
country, the strikers refused to 
go back to work. 

The walkout has all but shut 
down the oil industry in Iran, 
the world 's second-largest oil 
exporter and a major supplier

Israeli withdrawal from the

Israeli television 's military 
correspondent said maps ha've 

~n drawn dividing the Sinai 
mto four areas. He gave this 
breakdown of the areas ex-
tending from the canal east-
ward into the Sinai: 

- The first will be for limited 
Egyptian forces. Egypt will be 
allowed 230 tanks and 100 pieces 
of artillery and anti-aircraft 
guns, double its present a r-
mored strength there. No anti-
aircraft missiles will be per-
mitted east of the canal. 

- The second area is to be a 
demilitarized zone, and Egypt 
will be a llowed four battalions 
of ciVilian guards who will 
carry only small arms. 

- The third area will be under 
United Nations supervision but 
civilian Egyptian-police wiil be 
permitted

ReceSSion 'Inevitable' 

- The fourth zone will be on 
the Israeli side and will be a 
ribbon of land varying from .6 
miles to 1.8 miles wide along the 
border where Israel can station 
four battalions. 

According to the broadcast 
Israel will destroy all its secret 
installations in the Sinai, but its 
three airfields will be handed 
over intact, after the equip-
ment lias been removed. The 
one to be used by the Egyptians 
was not identified. 

NEW YORK CAP) - Econo-
mist Milton Friedman said 
Sunday that a U.S. recession Is 
inevitable and could come as 
early as the first quarter of next 
year. 

• 'There is only one thing I am 
sure of , " Friedman said. 
"We' re going to have a reces-
Sion, and the later it happens, 
the deeper it will be." 

A recession is a temporary 
falling off of business activity 
and growth, usually after a 
period of rapid growth. 

" If we have more 'inflation 
we will have a recession. If w~ 
have less, we will also have a 
recession, " added the Nobel 
Prize winner. 

He was interviewed on NBC's 
. " Meet the Press." 

Friedman said recession 
would come in the first part of 
1979 if the Federal Reserve 
Board retains tight money 
poliCies, which he advocates. 

But Friedman said Tues-
day ' s elections, in which 
referenda for cutting taxes and 
spend in, were victorious, 
foretold a time in which both 
inflation and recessions will be 
less severe. . 

"The American people are 
waking up to what the situa-
tion is," he said. "ADd they are

Palestinian Question 
Stili Holds Final Treaty 

NEW YORK (AP) - The 
Carter Administration 
launched a last-ditch effort 
yesterday to find a compromise 
on the Palestinian issue that 
threatened to derail a nego-
tiated peace treaty between 
Egypt and Israel. 

President Carter personally 
intervened with telephone calls 
to the leaders of both countries . 
He also dispatched Secretary of 
State Cyrus R. Vance to New 
York for an airport meeting 
with Menachem Begin, where 
Vance presented the Israeli 
prime minister with a new 
compromise draft on the 
volatile Palestinian question. 

However, after meeting for 
more than two hours, Vance 
and Begin emerged with no 
word that Israel had agreed to 
the new draft. 

A top State Department oW-
cial , who asked not to be 
named, said Vance gave Begin 
'and his top advisers new "com-
promise la ngua ge" dea ling 
with t h e link bet ween t he 
Egyptia n-Israeli t rea ty a nd 
future talks on the fate of 
P a les t inia ns in Israeli -oc-

cupied territory. 
While tf'le meeting produced 

no breakthroughs, Vance told 
reporters he remained optimis-
tic a treaty would be Signed. 

Further negotiations were 
scheduled for today in Wash-
ington and Begin said he would 
call a meeting of his Cabinet for 
la ter in the week to " take the 
appropriate decisions" on the 
treaty. 
It was understood that mem-

bers of the Israeli delegation to 
the Washington treaty talks 
partiCipated in writing the 
draft with Vance . Aharon 
Barak, an Israeli supreme 
court justice a nd one of that 
cou~try 's leading legal experts. 
participated in the discussions. 

The Begin-Vance meeting 
took place at Kennedy Inter-
national Ai rport, where Begin 
had stopped on his way back to 
Israel from an official visit to 
Canada. 

Carter talked by telephone 
fro!ll the Oval Office to Begin 
while the prime minister was 
still in Toronto. The president 

rea~hed Sadat in Cairo.

lin Craftsmen Receive Plaudits 
By Lyue Reid-1OI8 

AD art aDd profeuioo once in 
daqer of becominl obaolete in 
the United States Is now 
eiQGYiDI a healthy comeback. 
Americaa violin makers today 
are recopized amoDJ the beat 
ID the world. 

The UCSD Muaic Depart-
meat, auiated by the Southern 
CaUfomia ViollD Aaaoclation, 
hosted the sixth annual con-
ventioa of the Violin Society of 
AlJl8rica and the Third Inter-
national Competition and 
Exhibltioa of violins, violas, 
cellos, baues and bows here 
this weekend. 

The Violin Society has three 
main objectives ; to bring 
maker and player together, to 
stimulate interest in the craft 
and finally , to provide en-
couragement and support to 
yoUlli craftsmen. 

The judging of the quality of 
workmanship was done by 
renown violin makers hailing 
from around the world. Three 
local musicians who aid~ in 

JudliDJ tonal quality were: 
Anthony Porto from Grossmant 
Colle,e, Paul Anderson from 
San Dieto State and MarjOrie 
Hart from the University of San 
Die,o. 

Professional as well as 
amateur craftsmen and women 
representing five continents 
and sixteen countries entered 
nearly 300 instruments In tbe 
competition. 

Strin, instruments were 
judged for their workmanship 
and tonal quality. Competing 
for the first time, bows were 
evaluated for workmanship. 

A total of 11 makers were 
awarded the gold medal of 
excellence. All but five were 
from tbe United States. 
"Americana are as good or 
better than anyone else In the 
world when it comes to crafts-
manship. A majority of this 
year's winners were under 35 
years old. They're entering the 
craft ~ause they're finding 
they can make a good living 
with it," explained Eric Chap-

man, president of the VloUn 
Society. 

There are two violin making 
schools in this country, one in 
Salt Lake City, the other II) 
Chica,o. The Violin Society 
started a scholarship pro,ram 
in 1976. "Tbe scholarships are 
for promising youn, muslciana 
and makers In need of fiDjsbing 
their training. Dropout rates 
have coincided with financial 
need in the past," Chapman 
said. 

Over $20,000 was raised 
yesterday for the scholarship 
prolram, as donated instru-
ments were auctioned off to 
members of the Society. A 
Tourte bow, given to tbe Society 
by Etienne Vatelot, was sold for 
'10,500. 

Both the tone and workman-
ship judees aereed the com-
petition was the biggest ever 
beld. Marjorie Hart, a cellor 
tone judge and chairman of the 
University of San Dleao Fine 
Arts Department praised the 
competitive spirit of the 

makers: "competition creates 
business 'and It raiaes tbe level 
of quaUty of the art of violin 
making." 

When completed, new viollns 
sell for 'UOO to ",000. They are 
made of maple and spruce 
woods, with ebony or boxwood 
fittinp. The woods are selected 
for their grain pa~m, strength 
and density. '!be avera,e time 
spent on making the instru-
ments Is about 200 hours. A full 
time professional maker can 
produce eight or 10 vIolins a 
year. 

Among those attending the 
competition was a father-son 
violin-making team. Herman 
and Henry Bischofberler 
operate a shop in Seattle, 
Washington. Although most of 
tbeir business consists of 
repaif'ing violins , the two 
mana,e to make one or two 
violins a years. 

The Bischofberger family 
bas been making violins for 
three generations. When 'J:l-
year-()ld Henry took an interest 

in the craft seven years ago, he 
went to the Swiu Violin-mater 
scbool In Brienz. Since re-
turning from the school, Heary 
has made several violins, one of 
whicb won second prize ID a 
violin competition held in 
Canada ID 1975. 

Gold medal winners of the 
ViollD Society of America this 
year for violin workmanahip 

. are : Rolland Feller (San 
Francisco) , David Gusset (San 
Francisco), Horacio Pineiro 
(New York) . 

Receiving gold medals for 
violin tone were : Rlcbard 
Oppelt (New York) , Paul 
Schuback (Oregon) , Rena 
Welsshaar (Costa Mesa), 
Haagan Farrell (Bulgaria). 

Viola workmanship gold 
medals were awarded to: Paul 
Hart (Utah) , and Marsaret 
Shlpma,n (Van NUYI) . 

Receiving gold medals for

New Arthritis Drug, 'Sulindac ' 
Might Replace Aspirin Mark~t 

By Kevin McKean 
AP Sdeace Wriler 

NEW YORK (AP) - A new 
drug went on the market 
last week that may allow the 
nation's 25 million arthritis 
sufferers to put away their 
aspirin bottles and lind new 
pain relief with fewer side 
effects. 

The drug is sullndac, and its 
developers tout it as a substi-
tute for aspirin, still the drug 
mo~t ,:"idely used to fight the 
nation s most common cri~ 
pIer. 

A major feature of sulindac 
wh~ch. is a~ailable only by pre: 
scnptJon, IS that it would only 
have to be taken twice a day 
not three or four times a day a~ 
with aspirin and most other 
drugs. 

The developers of sulindac 
also say it is a unique anti-
arthritis medicine because it 
doesn't start working until 
after its absorption by the 

dig~stive system, thus re-
dU CIng stomach upset and 
chances of ulcers. 

Dr. Herbert Diamond, one of 
200 researchers who belped in 
sulindac's 12-year develop-
ment, says It is "the only DOn-
steroid, anti-inflammatory 
drug approved for all five 

major types of arthritis. II 
Diamond is professor of 

medicine at the State Uni-
versity of New York Downstate 
Medical Center here. He and 
Dr. ,John Calabro, director of 
~eumatology at City Hopsital 
In .Worcester, Mass ., said 
suhndac will be useful for 
patients who have trouble 
taking aspirin. 

The two said studies shOwed 
that 19.4 percent of patients 
developed stomach pain from 
prolonged us e of a s pirin , 
compared to 10.2 percent from 

SuJindac. 
Diamond said aspirin, sulin-

dac and all other non-steroids 
- are believed to ·work against 
arthritis by blocking the 
production of substances 
known as prostaglandins. 

The most common form of 
arthritis is osteoarthritis, also 
kn~WD as the disease of aging, 
which affects 16 million Ameri-
cans. Rheumatoid arthritis is 
the most severe form, disabling 
more that half of its 6'h million 
U.S. victims.

Dr. Smith explained that the 
current research is " just a 
!~asabi1ity study. Essentially, 
It s on the same groundwork as 
di sposi ng of the waste by 
shooting it up into outer space, 
or putting it into salt domes." 

The Scripps work is part of 
the Department of Energy's 
Sea bed Disposal Progra m 
which is managed by Sandi~ 
Laboratori~s of Albuquerque, 
New MeXICO. Part oC this 
progr~,? involves developing a 
capabIlity for assessing the 
ocean disposal programs of 
other nations. Dr. A.A. Yaya. 
nos of Sc ripps , expedition 
coordinator, explained that 
although the United States has 
not yet a dopted a Corm al 
program for the disposal of 
radioactive wastes, some other 
nations have already begun to 
do so. He said that European 
countries have dumped pack-
aged wastes containirg low 
concentrations of radioactivity 
(" lOW-level" wastes) into the 
Atlantic Ocean sever~1 times in 
past years . A recent Time 
magazine article stated that 

U~~O(fr:. 
prftfttu CUI i11".tralal Ic!we 

Yayanos believes that much 
re~earch needs to be done 
beCore a Cinal resting place for 
the world's radioactive wastes 
can be intelligently chosen. He 
hopes to continue biological 
studies relevant to the ocean 
disposal option by studying 
deep·sea organisms in the 
laboratory and determining 
how radioactive isotopes are 
concentrated and moved 
through the food chain from 
ba cteria , to the amphipod 
c.rust:!ceans, and perhaps to 
fIsh . We are operating on the 
assumption that there will be 
leaks and there will be acci-
dents," he said.

Wbat a differeace a month 

metres. Tbe water polo team, 
havlnc edpd San DieIOState l-
I four weeb 180, torpedoed the 
Aateea 16-7 Tbunday at the 
Natatorium. 

The next day, in a matcbup 
that didn't couat on the team's 
record but did count in the 
players' mindI, the Tritons 
apln beld the viaitiq team to 
only leven points. They scored 
13 of their own to upset favored 
Palomar Junior Collele. 

In the first lame, UCSD burst 
abead to a firat half 10-2 
advantqe on a barrale of 
loals by the wbole startiq 
team and more, Kai Loedel, 
Dan Crane, Dan Eby, Mark 
~rdon, Tom JorleJUlen, Jeff 
Elliott and Grel Maletis. 

Tbe Aztecs, witb only 10 
players and DO coach, could not 
hope to keep up with the well-
conditioned Tritons . Beinl 
much stronler than UCSD, 
however, they muscled five 
second-half scores past goalie 
Willie Morris. 

In two fourth quarter goals, 
hittine the far corner of the ,oal 
on an extra man situatiOll, and 
Oippiq the ball Over the loalie 
after maneuveriDl put the 
defeDle on a drive. -

"Tracy is really coming 
around," said coaeb Russ 
Hafferkamp of his freshman 
player. "He hasn't had a stronl" 
water polo bacqround, but 
be's one of the hardest workers. 
He's really intense." 

Mter their fourth straight 
victory., the squad was ready to 
face off alainst bigbly-touted 
Palomar. ThoUlh only a two-
year school, Palomar bas been 
relUlarly submereinl two and 
four year colleles alike this 
seuon. 

Tbe Triton defense pressured 
the visitors into taking hopeless 
sbots in the sballow end of the 
pool and Morris only allOwed a 
sinlle goal in that end the entire 
game. Loedel took charge of the 
offensive forces, scoring five 
times that afternoon. 

acknowlqed that the home 
pool advanlale was a very real 
one in this contest. "Palomar 
doesn't practice in a shallow 
pool, and they found it bard to 
adjust to the UCSD pool. 
Palomar ls a very ,~ JC _ 
this is juat not one of their best 

quality games." 
Hafferkamp too wal im-

pressed with his team's play 
Friday. "Today was a lood 
indicator of our improvement 
this season. Water polo ls very 
analo,GUS to basketball. We 
run four or'five basic plays, and 

DOW the guys are comfortable 
with that sYltem. Now we can 
deviate from that system a 
little, add some cross court 
passin, and picks. And it's the 
same thilll on defense. We 
know what to do and this allows 
us to work within the system." 

Eby added his second and 
third points and Loedel put in 
his fourth on fast breaks. Jim 
Senz scored his Drst of the 
game and Tracy Patrick threw 

The two officials at the game, 
botb having refereed the 
Tritons a number of times, 
agreed that this was San 
Diego's Finest game tbis year. 
One of tbem, Fred Becker. The Trilons came up with two big wins las' week, blasting San Diego State and Palomar CoJJege.

The Tn tons found the course 
in surprisingly good shape, 
despite the heavy rains which 
fell all day on Friday. During 
warm·ups, however, it rained 
for 20 minutes, leaving the 
course very soggy. The leaders 
still managed to pass the mile 
mark at 4: 40, with all the UC&D 
runners under 5: 20. Using the 
strategy of starting out at a 
reasonable pace, Instead of 
loiq out with the leaders, 
helped the Triton's team 
performance. 

Naturally, Coach Andy Skief 
was pleased with Saturday's 
resUlts. "We've come a long 
way from not having a team 3 
year'll a,o to finishing 4th in the 
district this year. I think we've 
laid out the foundation for a 
winnin, cross country and 
track PI'Oenm in future years. 
Pete Dolan is just a sophomore 
and Ganizer, Morton and 
Steinhart are freshmen. We 
sbould be ri,ht up there next 
year."

ambiguously named 1994, 
whom I suspect their record

new standard bearers of bard 
rock. Though I had my hopes 
high - somethinl inside my

solos that are fast, nashy and 
screaming without the needed 
intelligence or forethought 
that's set Ritchie Blackmore,

How long has it been since you've

total reminded me of a dyinJ 
diDouur miDdleuly smaabiq 
anytbint that lot ill ita way, 
wutlnl Ume and enel'lY in a fit 
of U8eleu l'IlIe that served only 
to ennervate the beaat only 
faster and furtber. 

There were a couple of ,ood 
moment., bowever. Karen 
Lawrence, a Linda Ronstadt 
clone, possesses a nJlty drain-
pipes voice akin to Lydia Pense 
(of Cold Blood) and BoDDie 
Tyler whlcb could be put to 
better U8e elsewhere. AI a rule 
of thumb, ra.py vocals in bard 
rock are best left to men, a. In 
tbe case of Paul Rod,ers, 
Frankie Miller, Bob Se,er or 
Rod Stewart. Don't ask me 
wby. Guitarists Steve Scbiff 
and another one wbose name I 
don't recall bad a few moments 
of inspirational plaYinJ, es-
pecially during their rendition 
of Robert Johnson's "Cross-
roads," made famous by 
Cream. Both of them bave 
ample facility and touch, and 
succeeded in their trade-offs to 
rt!-create Eric Clapton's ori-
linal guitar solo note for note. I 
find it ironic, however, that it 
took two guitarists to replicate 
what origihally took one 
guitarist to accomplish. The 
less said about drummer John 
Desautels and bassist Bill 
Rhodes the better, as both of 
them managed more to get in 
the way of thiRls rather than 
expedite them. 

This reveiw, though. should 
not be construed as any kind of 
"goodbye to rock" testament 
by someone hopelessly 
wrapped up in his own trivial 
reification. The basic state-
ment is that despite the artists 
mentioned before, hard rock is 
a dead horse, a fonn that's 
largely exhausted its potential'. 
There are too many other good 
rock artists for me to call it

and told Gordon Liddy, who 
headed the political intel-
U,ence-,atherin, operation, to 
find out about it. Liddy'. men 
"broke in .uccessfuUy at tbe 
Wateflate .. .fishlnl for infor-
mation of a financial nature 
tbat would somehow embar-
rass tbe Democrats, to handle 
the problem tbat was buried 
immediate in everyone's head 
at that time with these ITT 
hearin,s." 

say, though, I did cross the line, 
and no longer was I a fact-
finder, but suddenly I became 
part of a conspiracy to obstruct 
justice and to cover Watergate 
up." 

Slowness Blamed on (What Else?) 13 

"There's no doubt in my mind 
why they broke in the last time, 
the time they were caught," 
explained Dean, "because two 
days afterward Liddy would 
tell them ... Jeff Magruder 
insisted we go back in there; he 
was very unhappy witb the 
information we collected And 
gathered. We also went back to 
repair the bug we put in 
O'Brien's (Chief of Democratic 
Committee) office because it 
didn't work." 

By testifying at the Water-
gate hearings, Dean thought he 
would start a process which 
would bring the conspiracy to 
an end - "that was a naive 
thought."

switching or adding classe., 
and often refer to the CAPE 
booklet. 

"We are very aware of the 
fact that professors read CAPE 
too," added Sullivan, "and we 
keep them in mind when we're 
editing the comments for 
publication. We realize that 
copies of CAPE will probably 
appear in a professor's files." 

With a $31,000 budget this 
year (which must cover sup-
plies, salaries and operating 
and publishing costs) , the eight 
permanent staff members have 
been hard-pressed to get this 
quarter's publication out in 
time. According to Hafner, "we 
have been working very hard 
aU summer, putting in a lot 
more hours tban our pay 
renects. But it looks like the 
CAPE issue for winter won'tbe 
out until after registration, 

probably in about three more 
weeks. It will .till be uaeful, 
however, for .tudents switch-
ing or addin, claues." 

Hafner mentioned tbat the 
major reason for the delay was 
"due to Propo.ition 13 ... We had 
to fire lbe entire staff for a 
month this summer as a result 
of Prop. 13." 

CAPE began as a collective 
back in 1973, run and adminis-
tered by students. It was 
designed to fill a number of 
important needs, among these, 
"To provide valuable direction 
for future forms of education at 
UCSD ... To communicate back 
to the faculty about bow 
students feel re,ardlq their 
classes ... " and to aid in 
establishin, a "comprehensive 
program for the study and 
improvement of the educa-
tional environment of UCSO, 
involving a cooperative effort 

between student and faculty." 
"Cooperation," .aid Sul-

livan, "is the word I'd like to 
stress. Every quarter we 
encounter professors who 
refuse to be 'CAPED' at all, or 
else reschedule at tbe very last 
minute. They think of it as a 
major inconvenience, an un-
necessary interruption of their 
lesson plan.. But they must 
learn to realize how valuable 
the information really Is, and 
how helpful it is for professors 
as well as students in providin, 
an important source of feed-
back." 

" Historians who look back at 
Watergate have trouble ac-
cepting the theory I have just 
given you ... they can't believe 
everybody was that stupid, and 
they've got to look for more, 
they're giving them more 
benefit of the doubt. .. I'm afraid 
the historians are never going 
to find more than what I just 
told you," said Dean. 

At 3: 30 on Thursday after-
noon in APM 2113, the Regent's 
Lecture will be combined with 
the APIS Seminar wbere 
Kressel will deliver a talk 
entitled "Epitaxy for III-V 
Compound Devices" - a 
subject involving the physics of 
transistor and injection-laser 
technology. The last lecture in 
this series is scheduled for 
Friday morning at 9: 00. At that 
time the guest speaker will 
discuss "Lasers and Detectors 
for Fiber Optics Communi-
cations." As in the case of the 
second of the lectures, this last 
one will be presented in P&L 
1UO. 

'Why Not Here?' to Take 
Place of Rusty Side Door 

In 1975, tbe or,anization at 
CAPE cbanled from a collec-
tive to a more bierarchical 
structure with a director and . 
staff. Today Katie Sullivan, the 
director, h81 a permanent staff 
of eight under her and IS 
"runners" hired to administer 
the carda in each cl.... Said 
Sullivan, "I prefer to think of 
my position as more of a 
coordinator role. We all work 
together, still aloq the lines of 
a collective." 
. Sullivan pointed out that 

"CAPE tries to remain neutral 
politically - We are fii'st and 
foremost a service to the 
students. But we are also very 
concerned about tenure 
hearings and the way CAPE 
evaluations are used in 
reaching decisions." She said 
that bad evaluations are used in 
reaching deci.ions." She said 
tbat bad evaluations are often 
given extra weight in tenure 
decisions, while good evalua-
tions "usually carry no clout at 
all in helping to retain a 

Dean said he was known as 
the " old lady around the White 
House" for his attitude. "I told 
Haldeman I didn't think the 
President needed buggings and 
muggings and prostitutes to 
win the '72 election. I told him 
that was really uncalled for and 
I didn't think anyone at the 
White House should have 
anything to do with anything 
like this, nor was I going to have 
anything to do with this." 

., At the time I thought I could 
assist and find facts and keep 
myself free from being .in any 
kind of trouble, " said Dean. "I 
thought that was what the 
counsel to the President should 
be doing - finding out what had 
happened and reporting the 
facts back and forth . I must 

Speaking by telephone from 
his office in Princeton, Kressel 
said, "I'm very pleased to have 
this opportunity." He explained 
that since he completed post-
graduate work, this will 
probably be the first time he 
has been on a college campus 
and he looks forward to spend-
ing some time with students 
and professors, alike. 

Kressel will return later in 
the year to do a second week of 
lectures, . however the exact 
dates of that series have not yet 
been established. " I don' t think 
we have it firmed up," said 
Kressel , "but it looks like the 
week of February 12."

The opening of the new "Why 
Not Here?" on Revelle Campus 
last night should, said its co-
founder Bruce Bauman, mark 
a 100% increase in quality and 
atmosphere over the old "Side 
Door" which it replaces. 

Revelle RAs Bauman and 
Richard Mills took over the 
operation of tbe Side Door as 
their RA project because of the 
many faults in the running of 
the Side Door last year, 
Bauman explained. 

As it was previously run, the 
Side Door, located next to the 
Revelle Cafeteria, was open 
from Sunday through Thurs-
day as a place for students to 
go and find food and restful 
surroundings. Why Not Here?, 
said Bauman, will improve on 
this function by offering a 
better selection of exotic spiced 
teas as well as coffee.

Eventually, Bauman said, 
Why Not Here? hopes to offer 15 
different teas, all special 
blends brought in from the 
Pannikin in La Jolla. Besides 
these, and the particular coffee

coffee-tasting and opening 
ceremonies, Bauman said Why 
Not Here? will offer a selection 
of doughnuts and fresh baked 
cookies and danish at reason-
able prices.
