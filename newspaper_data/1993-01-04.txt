PLAYING THE 
MONEY GAME 

By P HILIP MICHAELS, SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

~ew year may have just be-gun, but the same budget problems that have dogged the University of Cali-fornia for the past sev-
eral years continue to persist in 1993, 
and many UC administrators believe 
the worst is yet to come. The already 
grim financial picture could become 
much bleaker this week when gover-
nor Pete Wilson is scheduled to re-
lease his proposed budget. 

The UC system, already facing a 
$225 million deficit for the 1992-93 
school year, could see its state funding 
slashed for 1993-94 by up to 10 per-
cent of this year's $1.88 billion total, 

acco~g to UC San Diego Chancel-
lor Richard Atkinson. Last year, Gov-

funding to the university by 10.5 per-

"This is the worst time for the

Atkinson said. 

Speculation over Wilson 's budget, 
which will be announced on Jan. 10, 
follows on the heels of a $605 fee hike 
which the UC Board of Regents ap-
proved last month to offset orne of 
the university's current budget defi-
cit. Looming budget cuts and fee in-
creases have contributed to growing 
fears that the UC's financial picture 
wi\1 keep getting worse.

and representatives from the ~sociated 
Students. Universiry CenterBoard (UCB) 
Graduate Student As ociation (GSA) and 
the university administration. Talks were 
put on hold during the Winter break. 

"Many of the co-op members didn ' t 
want negotiations over the Christmas 
break. and the A.S. thought this was ben-
eficial, since there weren't going to be any 
tudents around anyway," said A.S. Vice-

Pre idem Adminis trative Randolph 
Siwabessy. 

According to Siwab ssy. negotiations 
will begin again today, with ight et on a 
resolution by the end of the month. While 
the co-op have expressed a de. ire to ex-
tend negotiations, A.S. attorney John 
Francis wants to arrive at an agreement by 
Jan. 31. Otherwise, Siwabes 'y said, the 
A.S. will withdraw. 

During the break, however, there were 
two session meetings among members of 
the co-op , A.S., UCB. GSA and the uni-
versity. The meetings included di cu sion 
on the January timetable and different 
ideas and concerns. 

Attorney John Francis and A.S. Presi-

ber Steve Dubb will represent the GSA, 
UCB Chair Chris Burnell will represent 
the UCB, University Attorney Joanna 
Beam, Assi tant Vice-Chancellor of Stu-
dent Service Tom Tucker and UCB Di-
rector Jim Carruthers will repre ent the

facilitator. 

UC Proposes New Company to Stimulate State Economy 
BUDGET: Corporation 
would license and market 
UC developed technology 
By francisco DeVries 
News Editor 

TheUnjversityofCalifomiawill 
be jumping further into the business 
world if a new proposal unveiled by 
UC President Jack Peltason i~ ap-
proved by the regents later this year. 

Peltason's proposal, first an-
nouncedduring the DecemberBoard 
of Regents meeting in San Fran-
cisco, would create a for-profit cor-
poration and a non-profit founda-
tion to help develop, license and 
mmet new technology invented at 

the nine UC campuses and the three 
Department of Energy laboratories 
managed by the university. 
. The corporation, named the UC 
Technology Development Com-
pany, "would fund technology that 
has licensing potential but needs 
further development for the com-
mercial market. The company also 
would provide' seed' money to build 
new business ventures to a point at 
which they can attract investments 
from the private sector," according 
to the UC Office of the President. 

If successful, the Office of the 
President estimate that the new 
company may playa izeable role in 
pulling up the entire California 

economy, at the same time bolster-
ing the university ' own beleaguered 
budget. 

Office of the President projec-
tion run as high as a $9.5 billion 
influx into the California economy 
in only eight years. 

Peltason aid in a telephone pre s 
conference after the announcement 
that by the year 200 I he anticipates 
350 new technologies developed and 
22 start-up companies formed. 

The university would also di-
rectly benefit from the increase of 
marketed technologie . Currently, 
the university collects around $28 
million a year in royalty income

Students Sue to Halt Building of RIMAe 
A lawsuit was filed on December 10, 1992 by three 

UCSD students against three UC administrators, Vice 
Chancellor of Undergraduate Affairs Joseph Watson. 
Assistant Vice Chancellor of Student Programs and 
Facilities Tom Tucker and Director of Student Govem-
ment Services Randy Woodard. 

The lawsuit claims to prevent the regents from 
entering into contracts connected to the constuction of 
RIMAC (Recreation, Intramural, Athletic and Events 
Complex) and to address alleged violations of the Fifth 
and Fourteenth Amendments to United States Constitu-
tion as the result of the student referendum held as a 
litmus test for approval of the project and for imposition 
of a new $210 per year student fee to pay for it. 

The RIMAC construction costs are expected to be 
nearly $28 million. However, total costs to students 
during the term of the 27·year debt service may exceed 
$100 million for construction, maintenance, operations 
and financing. The plaintiffs contend that the referen-
dum was conducted illegally, and that their constitu-
tional rights have been violated because the university 
failed to grant any hearing on the formal grievances filed 
to challenge the referendum results. 

Institute For Marine Research 
To Study Global Change 

A cooperative research agreement creating the Joint 
Institute for Marine Observations to study long-term 
global environmental processes has been formed be-
tween the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminis-
tration (NOAA) of the Department of Commerce and 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography and UCSD. 

According to NOAA offiCials. the purpose of the 
institute is to enhance research and the collection of 
data in the oceans and atmosphere important to under-
standing global change and other long-term phenom-
ena. The work will include basic science investigations, 

instrument development, acquiring and processing en-
vironmental data and applying the information to model 
and predict Mure conditions. 

The research activities of .' ins,itute will focus on 
long-term ocean observations, fishery research, experi-
mental climate forecasting and scientific data manage-
ment. A primary aim will be to establish methods for 
observing and measuring variability in the global, re-
gional and coastal oceans on time scales from years to 
decades. 

According to SIO Director Dr. Edward A. Frieman, the 
acting director of the Joint Institute will be Dr. Warren 
White. an SIO research oceanographer. In addition, 

. NOAA will donate $151,000 to the program to enhance 
a strong educational component, which will support 
graduate students, postdoctoral fellowships and visit-
ing scientists. Future collaborative research projects will 
be individually funded as the joint institute develops. 
with support corning through NOAA's National Ocean 
Service, Office of Global Programs. 

UCSD Student Program Wins 
National leadership Contest 

UCSD Director of Student Organizations and leader-
ship Programs Yolanda Garcia accepted an award on 
behalf of UCSD's Student Affairs Staff for the develop-
ment of a new student leadership program. 

During a national conference on student services in 
Washington, D.C., UCSD won the top award in a contest 
sponsored by the National On-Campus Report. 

The 1992 "Best Ideas in Student Services" award 
went to UCSD for a series of 13 leadership development 
programs which were offere.d to students during the 
1991-92 academic year. The series featured seminars 
ranging from running effective meetings and managing 
stress to dealing with the media and understanding 
cultural diverSity.

Research and Teaching-
Strange Bedfellows 
By ErIc Schmidt 
Senior Staff Writer 

As fees rise. classes grow and professoo; leave the University of California, the debate over reo search versus leaching seems to have dimin· bhcd TIle issue aclually holds more impor-
tance now than ever, since the financial survival of the 
university hinges on its ability to wring as much 
money as po:.sible from research. 

Already, research grants have saved the U from 
the fate of the California State University system, 
which has suffered severe taff. facul!yand classcuts. 
However. the CSU can be considered a son of 
barometer fOf the UC - UC research dollars cannot 
indefinitely dampen the effects of the deficit in Slate 
funding.

As a result. the UC finds 
itself forced to st.ep up em-
phasis on research, which 
already is given a higher sta-
tus than education. One 
profit-motivated scheme fOf 
research involves the fonna-
tion of corpor.ltions around 
UC<reatedtechnology. The 
proposed UC Technology 
DevelopmemCo. would use 
private money 10 fund re-
search into potential tech-
nologies. thereby eamingthe 
right to the patents on those 
lechnol gies, 

~ uming the progr.un 
begins next year. such acOf-
poralion could give the uni-
versity $220million peryear 
in royalties by 200 I, up from 
Ihe current $30 mi Ilion re-
cei ved for patents. That profit 
would largely helpoffsetcuts 
in state funding such as the 
$245 millioncut in 1992-93. 

While the plan is laud-
able for reducing UCdepen-
dence on stale funds, it also 
unear!hsseverJI i uesrelat-
ing 10 the research versus 
teaching debate. The m05l 

obvious effect of increased revenue from research is 
increased emphasis on research.

further emphasis on research will inevitably shift 
attention from students. 

TIle proposed company could further damage \lie 
UC education by de·emphasizing basic research. 
Now. research often involves basic scientific in vesti-
gation with little or no immediate monetary val ue. A 
profit -oriemed organization funding so much techno-
logical research could lead professors away from the 
basics, which foml the core of university education. 

On the other hand, research revenues could stop 
the Board of Regents from further raising fees. TIle

students paid over $1 O,<XXl for the 1991-92 academic 
year, $2.CXXl more than the national average. On the 
heel of four years of fee increases and looming under 
the thr-.!at of future increases. any plan to reduce costs 
to students seem practical. 

It would appear. then, that the university can either

It 's not all bad news for the UC student. though. 
After all, there i no strong demarcation between

THE ART OF ADMINISTRATION 
cor.tWENrARY: It doesn't take a genius to see that sturents are crumbling under the weight of UCSD bureaucracy and red tape 

By Matt Robinson 
Senior Staff Writer 

I have often wondered, in my more leisurely and contrarian moments. how orne of history 's big guns would overhaul and improve UC 
San Diego. Imagine that, like some 
on of J urassic P~ the bioengineers 

at UCSD managed to reanimate Plato 
or some other great educator. We 
could interview him on the tate of 
education at the modem university. 
Or even ask him about UCSD itself. 
Tho e individuals who constitute sig-
nificant (or in politically incorrect 
language, "great") thinkers would no 
doubt give intere ting insights into 
our humble little La Jolla school. 

And while I attempt to be a fair and 
sober-m inded observer of the passi ng 
scene, it seems undeniable that we 
could use a Robe pierre or a Marat or 
some uch revolutionary to wake the 
administration from it dogmatic 
slumbers. Revolutionary does not 
mean those " tudents" who never 
seem to graduate and are caught in the 
inescapable gravity of leftist politics, 
perpetually indignant (hat Vietnam is 
over and they missed their chance to 
protest it or that Oliver Stone has not 
made another movie indicting 
"Amerika." What I mean is the type 
of thinker who could put fonh a legiti-
mate critique of UC San Diego be-
cause if this is to be a place worthy of 
being called a university, we are in 
dire need of such criticisms. 

Franz Kat1ca and George Orwell, 
for instance, would not enjoy attend-
ing UCSD and for damn good reason. 
They. of course. might find grist for 
the writing mill. But given the con-
versationsl have had withotherUCSD 
students, it has become clear that 
Kafka would find in UCSD's long 
Jines the tedious and draining punish-
ments of bureaucracy. Likewise, 

SHAM: University

rather than ideas 
Continued from page 4 
completely different things. 

I would humbly suggestthat, for at 
least the last 50 years or so, the univer-
sity has been interested more in pur-
suing ideals, or even ideology, than 
actual ideas. II is pursuing the ideal of 
educational excellence, mther than 
actually being excellent. It relies on 
rigid programs like "Making of the 
Modern World" and "Dimensions of 
CuLture" to expose students to an un-
differentiated mass of concepts and 
ideas they ought to know, but fails to 
teach the analytical skills necessary 
to make heads or tails of what they are 
reading or writing about. 

Berkeley. the flagship of the uni-
versity, is so highly revered and there-
fore so exclusive that students practi-
cally have to sell their souls to be 
accepted into the place. 

Sure, Berkeley has a diverse and 
interesting campus. It has lovely trees 
and classic architecture. II has more 
Nobel Laureates than you can shake a 
scanning electron microscope at, and 
it even has an element named after it 
It has, in other words, everything that 
looks good in a campus catalogue or 
public relations brochure. 

But does it have good teachers? 
Does its student body learn anything? 
Is it a temple of learning or a social 
club for gray-haired scientists with 
bad ties spending millions of tax pay-

Orwell might smile as a prophet at a 
place that sells "parking pennits" at 
the same time that it holds all -year 
parking lot demolition parties. Yes, 
underneath the thin veneerofUCSD's 
image of a university there is a con-
tempt for both faculty and tudents. 

Bureaucracy IS one of the main 
problems with life at UCSD. One of 
the inherent liabilities of the interac-
tion of people is that it creates bureau-
cracy. But the degree. level, scale and 
general onslaught ofUCSD's Byzan-
tine bureaucracy seems at once both 
comic and trJgic. 

Trapped in linle windowless rooms 
throughout the UC system i a pecial 
class of human. The Bureaucrat. They 
water house plants and adorn the walls 
with posters of kittens and puppies 
fulsomely congregating in demon-
strationsof sentimentality all designed 
to impede progre and bring to the 
rational mind the same kind of cogni-
tive static equaled only in the KGB's 
white room or any Beverly HiU 90210 
episode. Talk to the UCSD student, 
any UCSD student, and a veritable 
avalanche of horror stories will be 
loosed about encounters with such 
bureaucrats. 

I found myself descending into 
this 10th circle of Kat1cesque tonure 
while registering fora summer school 
class one year ago. It illu trates why 
bureaucracy and the de ign of this 
school inhibit b'Ue liberal education. I 
went into the summer extensions of-
fice and after waiting for 20 minutes, 
I fmally shuffled my way to the head 
of the line. There I found that I could 
not register because I had taken an 
emergency loan and had not paid it 
back. 

Of course, like any UCSD stu-
dent, first I rolled my eyes and then 
restrained myself from blowing my 
brains out with a broomhandle 

ers' dollars on theirnever -ending quest 
to make a better light bulb? The evi-
dence would sugge t the latter. 

What , in fact, do aspiring 
Berkeleyites get for their heartache 
and sacrifice? Overcrowded classes 
taught by unqualified teaching assis-
tants. cramped and expensive hous-

Mauser. Fonunately.1 had nevereven 
taken such a loan. But not paying the 
regents means that all the forces of 
heaven were going to align again t 
me and I was no doubt about to enter 
the winter of my discontent. 

Now let me make clear that I do 
not yell at UCSD bureaucrats. Very 
few people do. I grit my teeth, muffle 
my rage and brace my elf for the 
quadrillion fonn that would be re-
quired (signed in triplicate after sacri-
ficing small animals). The UCSD 
bureaucrat, whetherin the Registrar's 
or some advising office, is not ovenly 
mean. They are condescending, yes, 
but never ovenly hostile. They just 
treat you with the slothful, relaxed 
disposition that is indicative of an 
amazingly inefficient system. Sonaru-
rally 1 asked what 1 would have to do 

for the money, which means that it is 
the best way one can waste $3,()()() a 
year (not including books, food. hous-
ing. etc.} for four or five years listen-
ing to dubious suppositions, bogus 
theories and outrageous opinions. 
Some especially gullible students 
spend quadruple that amount to listen 

to clear my name. 
According to the paper- huffling 

guru I had to travel to the Ca hier' 
office to get proof that I was paid up. 
Thi , of course. is not as easy as it 
sound . No bureaucrat want to take 
the chance or re pon ibility of being 
wrong. And this is the problem with 
government. For the next two and 
half hours I traveled to five different 
10cations and was treated with the 
veiled contempt and suspicion that 
omehow this fiasco was my fault. At 

each stage in my quest for vindication 
the bureaucrats were intracrnbleabout 
picking up the phone to help or ex-
plaining exactly how the emergency 
loan proce s works. Finally. I ended 
up ill the same place I started. And all 
they did to solve my problems was 
spend 1'01'0 minutes on the phone. 

It seems that in their infinite wi -
dom and their deluge of triplicate 
forms, no one had the foresight to 
think that students might have the 
same first and last name. There was 
no other information or additional 
verification. 

But this is not an isolated incident. 
Thisi amoreextremeexampleoflhe

bureaucracy creates. A few things 
seem 10 stand out about UCSD bu-
reaucracy. 

The student i not very important. 
The bureaucrat acts helpful only to 
save his job but does not exhibit Ihe 
k.ind of respect and aid one needs 
when dealing with the chaos that is 
UCSD. Of course, there are some 
hard workers and polite people but in 
the big picture sub tantive time sav-
ing help just isn't there. For the stu -
dent. time is the most valued and 
scarce commodity.

noisy agitators, idiotic local politicos 
and an occasional riot. In shon. they 
get nothing but more heartache and 
very little education. 

The sad truth is that the University 
of California, doubly cursed with be-
ing a state institution and legally 
obliged to admit the top two percent 
of the state's high school graduates, is 
a second-rate school with a third-rate 
student body and a fourth-rate cur-

lis reputation proceeds it, and that 
i all. II is the best education available 

to the same nonsense, except they do 
it in ancient buildings with ivory-
covered walts on the east coast. mostly 
in New England. 

College students today are being 
cheated. They have been cheated for 
the 20 or so years spent "learning." 
The schools do not educate, they in-
doctrinate. They "clarify values," 
bui Id self-esteem and teach every theo-
retical quackery as though it were the 
gospel truth •. even though. as the teach-
ers say, "there is no right or wrong 
answer." Students today can 't do long 
division, much less take the deriva-
tive of a function. They can't com-
pose a grammatical sentence. They 
can't spell. They don't know when 
the Civil War was and some of them 

lege student four years ago was some-
thing like 3.8. Today it is roughly 4.0. 
But what does a 4.0 really mean? Not 
much, apparently. The proliferation 
of remedial courses in reading, writ-
ingandarithmeticoncampusesacross 
the country demonstrates that stu-
dents are woefully unprepared fOrlhe 
rigors awaiting them in the univer-
sity. So standards must drop some 
more.

exchange of ideas. We are at an inter-
eSling point within the UC sy tern. 
Although challenged for funds, we 
choose to cut clas es, profe sors and 
raise tuitions instead of eliminating 
waste and bureaucrats. The student or 
the professor that has to get some-
thing done in this system is chal-
lenged with the mo t dark and intri-
calc labyrinth of procedures. One won-
ders why it is neCeSs,1ry to have the 
fom1s. offices and po itionsthatobvi-
ously drain the resources needed to 
truly improve university life. Instead 
of eliminating extraneous personnel, 
mllny bureaucrats have agreed to cut 
the time they work in order for every-
one to keep their jobs. But anyone 
who is familiar with real working 
knows that it is quality and not quan-
tity that determines success. 

Finally. the pre ent campus ys-
tem of dispersing tudents is a failure 
because it has no real incentive to 
keep students together. I do nO! be-
lieve I have ever heard lInyone ever 
ay. "Let's go hang out al Warren." 

Roger Revelle noted that UCSD 
was a failure in its attempt to create a 
western Harvard. "1 hoped Ihat some-
thing here - at that time il was still 
possible - thaI something cou Id ha ve 
happened here that would have been 
appropriate for the tudenls," aid 
Revelle in a 1985 interview for the 
UCSD 25th Anniversary Oral His-
tory Project. "But it has never hap-
pened here. " 

If we wish to be more than a trade 
school UCSD will have to serve the 
student and the professor. And there 
are plenty of ways to improve UCSD. 
But students and professors are not 
asked ( f do not include the A.S. be-
cause they have no relll or lIny useful 
purpose). And if we were asked it 
would probably require fomls in trip-
licate. 

week. In other words, without the 
custom of leuing students get by 
knowing Ie s than a minimum of the 
class material. the university 's pre ·ti-
gious science program would consist 
solely of a small number of fi rst-rate 
students who not only comprehend 
the material. but can apply it cre-
atively. 

Since the university is required by 
law to admit a certain number of the 
state's so-called best and brightest, 
quite a few dim bulbs end up passing 
through with degrees in a number of 
academic disciplines for which they 
haven ' t the slightest qualification . 
This is why so many would-be doc-
tors and scientists either end up pack-
ing their biology and chemistry de-
gree away in the basement and go 
into retail sales or, failing that, teach. 

This is not to say college students 
today don' t know anything. They do. 
Even the most naive freshman knows 
that if he drinks liquor before beer he 
has nothing to fear. but if he drinks 
beer before liquor he will never be 
sicker. More locally, he knows that 
parking on campus - if such a feat is 
still possible - without the proper 
permit will eam him a citation. He 
knows that student government is a 
sham and pays it no attention whatso-
ever. He knows. pre umably, that Bill 
Clinton is the next president of the 
United States. 

In short, he knows enough to get 
by in the world, and no more. In 
certain rare in tances, in the case of 
most engineering and computer pro-

A Prelude to UCSD? 
How Budget Cuts 
Impertled SDSU 

The ongoing budget problems 
facing the University of Cali fornia 
are, in many ways, comparable to 
the current budget difficulties at 
the California State Universities, 
most notably at San Diego State. 
Both the UC and CSU systems 
have experienced faculty layoffs, 
higher fees and burgeoning class 
sizes since the recession began. 

"This campus only gets 23 
percent of its budget from the 
state. Cal State gets 85 percent. 
We were able to soften the impact 
for a couple of years : UCSD 
Chancellor Richard Atkinson said. 

But many administrators, 
faculty and staff at UCSD and 
SDSU fear that as the budget 
criSIS continues, both the UC and 
CSU systems could be hit with 
similar cutbacks. 

"I don't think San Diego State 
is the worst case scenario," 
Atkinson said. "We laid off more 
faculty than San Diego State did. 
We went about it in a different 
way. We set up an early retire-
ment program." 

The problems at SDSU have 
existed for several years, 
according to University Spokesper-
son Rick Moore. In 199()'91, 
Moore said SDSU had to make 
major cuts to its temporary and 
part·time faculty In order to meet 
budget cuts. A problem arose 
when the campus departments 
with a greater number of part·tlme 
facult¥ were severely cut by the 
layoffs. 

When SDSU was faced with 
another budget cut of 5 to 20 
percent in May 1992, SDSU 
President Thomas Day decided to 
Imptement -deep and narrow 
cuts," which, according to Moore, 
would limit the damage to parts of 
the university. Day planned to 
layoff 111 tenured professors, 35 
tenure-track professors and 60 
part·time and temporary faculty 
members. The layoffs would have 
eliminated nine academic 
departments and severely cut 
programs in several other 
departments. 

-There was a feeling on the 
part of administrators that there 
was a ne d for speed,· said 
Moore. who suggested that any 
delay in action by Day would resu lt 
in deeper cuts. 

"[Day) believed at the time he 
had to get moving. So he did what 
he had to do, " Moore added. 

According to SDSU Sociology 
Professor James WOOd, Day's 
actions brought three straight 
votes of n<>-confidence against 
Day from faculty, including one no-
confidence vote from the 
academic senate. 

"There were other resolutions 
over the summer that clearly did 
influence his shifting money 
around back into instruction: said 
Wood, who also credits a protest 
vigil held by students for putting 
pressure on the administration. 

According to Moore, the layoffs 
were rescinded when rescue 
money became available from the 
temporary faci lities budget. At that 
point. Moore said, it became clear 
that Day did not need to act 
promptly. 

The animosity from Day's 
proposal still lingers, however, 
with many faculty members 
suggesting that the situation was 
not as drastic as Day claimed. 
According to Wood, the SDSU 
layoffs accounted for 83 percent 
of the layoffs in the CSU system. 

"It 's my opinion that [Day) 
wants to end tenure. He's been 
trying to do this since 1979-80. 
He tried to do it at Maryland: 
Wood said. Day was president at 
the University of Maryland until 
1980. 

Moore. however, believes that 
SDSU is different from other CSU 
schools. With a smaller temporary 
staff than other schools in the

PLAYING TH'E MONEY GAME 
How the Budget Is Decided 

Once the governor releases his proposed budget, 
the University of Califomla sets its budget based on 
proposed state funding. After conferring with the nine 
UC campuses and his administrative staff, UC Pres~ 
dent Jack Peltason forwards his recommendations to 
the Board of Regents. After final regental approval 
each campus is given its budget allocation for the year.

BUDGET: Fee 
hikes and layoff are 
just the beginning 
Continued from page 1 
knowing what the govemor would 
propose. he noted thaI "indications 
have been that we' re nOI going to 
get what we're asking for. " The 
regents requested a 5.5 percent in-
crease from Ihi year's budget at 
their Oct. IS meeling. 

A t U SO, Atkinson estimated 
that the university has reduced fac-
ulty and staff by approximately 600 
while increasing the number of stu-
dents admilled. Thi has created 
higher workload for professors. 

"There is anxiety and stres in 
ihe sy tern . There is the potential 
that we'1\ be in a very destructive 
mode," said Atk in on. 

With mo t universi ty adminis-
tralors andexecutivesconceding that 
the financial outlook is dim for the 
coming Ye:lr, Ihe problem for the 
UC now becomes where to make 
the neces ary cuts. TIle regents are 
considering propo al to cut the 
workforce. raise student fees and 
reduce enrollment. 

"There will be layoffs of taff 
and faculty and the departure of 
many of the best faculty to other 
institutions. There will be a reduc-
tion in the number of students ad-
milled. There will be an incre.ase in 
student fees. Overall , there will be a 
reduction in the quality of the uni-
versity," Atkinson predicted_ 

According to Student Regent 
Alex Wong, the governor's budget 
will force the regents to make pain-
ful decisions in order to meet the 
shortfalls in revenue. 

" If we're real ly hit with budget 
cuts, a pay cut will have to be put on 
the table, layoffs will be put on the 
table, fee increases will be back on 
the table," said Wong, adding that 
the regents have discussed rai ing 
fee an additional $ 100, 

Wong said he will vote against 
any proposal thaI raises student fees. 
At the Oct. 19 meeting of the Board 
of Regents, Wong, along with Re-
gentJeremiah Hallisey and Lt. Gov-
emor Leo McCarthy, voted against 
the $605 fee hike. Fourteen regents 
voted in favor of the increase. 

UCSD A s ociated Student 
Pre ident Mike Holme fears that 
with each fee increase, the UC is 

moving loward privatization, or i 
becoming 100 expensive for eco-
nomica lly di advantaged stu -
dents. 

" When the word ' tu ition ' starts 
gelling used, we move that much 
closer to privatization. Tuition has 
no limits. It can be raised a 101 
quicker," Holmes said" 

According to Vice Chancellor 
for Undergraduate Affairs Joseph 
Wat on, further fee increases may 
be the only solution to the problem. 
Lower fees, Wat on believes, would 
force the univers ity to reduce the 
number of high school graduates 
admitted to the university. 

" lftheuniversitycut enrollment 
and maintains low fees, il doe n' t 
offer opportunity for students 
whether they are low income or 
high income," said Watson, who 
feel thaI Ihe universi ty must com-
mil ilself 10 maintaining high stan-
dardsofbothquality and acce ibil-
ity. 

Reaction among UCSD students 
to the latest fee hike has forthe most 
part been negative, although some 
tudents have sugge ted that the in-

creases will have lillie overall ef-
fect. 

"Even if il doe go up, it will be 
about $ 1200 per quarter. That 's 
pretty good for the education we get 
here," said Kyle Michaelis, a senior 
at Revelle College. 

But many UCSD students believe 
that the fee hikes are just the latest 
example of the declining quality of 
education in the UC and the magni-
tude of the tate's financial woes. 

"To me, it seems like the tate 
government kind oflet down every-
one. They ' re suppo eed to look 
ahead in these thing . People could 
have seen this coming if they had 
the foresight," said Warren College 
junior Dean Wright. 

" I come from New Mexico, and 
there, going to medical school will 
be cheaper than i t is to be an 
undergrad here. My brother wants 
to go here. and I'm trying todiscour-
age him," said Mark Kozubal, a 
senior at Warren College. Kozubal 
feels that the level of education at 
UCSD is declining, citing bigger 
class sizes as a major problem. 

Fifth College senior Keal ii 
Takahashi agreed. noting that 
"everything 's going up_ Parking has 
gone up, and there's fewer spaces. 
Fees have gone up, and departments 

Makes final

recommendations

are getting cut. You 're gening less 
than what you paid for." 

Jane Brandon, a senior at Fifth 
College,said he believes that UCSD 
is gradually facing the same prob-
lems that have been predominant at 
San Diego State. "\t's kind of inevi-
table. It's happening slowly," she 
said. 

Concern that the UC i begin-
ning to feel the ame hardships that 
have \Jlagued the California State 
University (CSU) system over the 
past several years are rising anlong 
administrators, faculty and students. 
Some are suggesting that the two 
systems are already in the same 
boat. 

Last year, fees for CSU schools 
went up 40 percent, after a 20 per-
cent increase the previous year, ac-
cording to Bob Lloyd, the student 
representative from the College of 
Arts and Letters to San DiegoState's 
Academic Senate. Lloyd attended 
an October rally at UCLA where 
UC tudents were protesting fee in-
creases. 

"I t seems l ike we were yelling 
about fees a couple of years ago. 
l1le same things we were feeling 
two years ago, [UC students) were 
feeling [at the rally) ," said Lloyd. 

At San Diego Stale, 206 faculty 
members received layoff notices in 
May. 

Holme suggests that the prob-
lems at San Diego State are already 
in their early stages in the UC sys-
tem. panicularly at UCSD. "The 
VERIP Program [the UC's early 
retirement program) is the first step 
toward what's happening at State. 
UCSD is known for its faculty, and 
we're losing the best ones through 
early retirement," Holmes said. 

Atkinson noted that UCSD has 
already laid off more faculty than 
San Diego State through early re-
tirement, but said, " Wc've not got-
ten to the point of eliminating actual 
departments. " 

Wood, however, believes that 
while other universities may face 
budget problems, the situation at 
SDSU is an extreme case. 

"(SDSU Pre ident Thomas) 
Day's response is isolated. He's try-
ing to end tenure and is acting in an 
irresponsible and highly capricious 
manner," said J3JT]es Wood, a soci-
ology professor at UCSD, Wood 
said he doe n' t expect other CSU 
presidents to act in the same way.

FunhemlOre, he d~ribed the UC 
ystem as more commined to its 

faculty. 
Regardless of whether the UC 

will be suffering the same hardships 
as the CSV, the university must 
soon make difficult decisions about 
how to resolve the expected budget 
shonfall. According to Lassiter. UC 
policy is fonned when the UC presi-
dent consults with the nine cam-
puses. Proposals are then put for-
ward to the Board of Regents, which 
makes decisions for the university. 

At UCSD, Atkinson follows rec-
ommendations made by campus-
wide committees consisting of fac-
ulty. administrators and students, an 
arrangement that Holmes thinks 
should be reorganized into an over-
all task force because of the ongoing 
budget crisis. 

" When we' re talking about cut-
ting departments, a lot of other uni-
versities are putting out task forces 
to talk about what to cut," said 
Holmes, nOling that the task force 
would consist of students, faculty 
and staff. 

" Ever since last spring. we 've 
been trying to get the chancellor to 
set up one of these comminees," 
Holmes added. 

Atkinson, however, be)ieves that 
the multiple committees allow ev-
eryone to have a voice in the deci-
sion-making process. "This cam-
pus has a tradition which predates 
me in being very public about the 
budget," he said. 

"The trouble for all of us is that 
this is out of our contro\." Atkinson 
said. 

With fewer resources available 
from the state, some individuals are 
now advocating that the university 
reassess its budget priorities and 
organization. The University of 
California Student A ssociation 
(UCSA) is proposing that the uni-
versity eliminate administrative p0-
sitions, according to Andy Shaw, 
UCSA's executive director. 

"There's a number of assistant 
vice presidents and a slewof assis-
tant vice chancellors on each cam-
pus," said Shaw. " Eliminating all 
that with only a ten percent fee 
increase would close the gap to $30 
million. 

'" think it's only fair to begin to 
look at how to stop placing the ma-
jority of the burden on students' 
backs," Shaw continued.

SDSU: Is UCSD's 
cross-town neighbor 
living our future? 
Contlnued from page 8 
CSU system, SDSU was forced to 
layoff more faculty. 

"Despite the fact that we're a 
teaching university, San Diego State 
does a lot more research than other 
CSU schools. Other CSUs had a lot 
of part-t ime and tem porary facu Ity 
and staff. They stlO had part-time 
and temporary faculty to cut: Moore 
said. 

The California Faculty Association 
(CFA), an organization representing 
SDSU's faculty, charges that the 
university has been shifting money 
away from instruction, suggesting 
that the percentage of total budget 
for instruction has gone down while 
other areas including administration 
and athletics has gone up. 

"When you diminish the share 
that's going to instruct students and 
increase the money going to 
admin istration and football , that's 
reflecting somebody's priorities,-
said Jim Semelroth of the CFA, who 
suggests that Day does not place 
enough importance on education. 

Like the UC system, CSU schools 
will continue to be hit hard by budget 
cuts, with SDSU being affected 
severely. The Daily Aztec, SDSU's 
student paper, reported that a five 
percent cut in next year's budget is 
almost inevitable. 

"There's a feeling over here that 
we can't continue to [raise fees] ," 
said Moore, adding that the CSU 
schools are obligated to remain 
inexpenSive. Keeping fees low, 
however, means that other cuts will 
be necessary. 

"In one way or another, we' re 
going to have to cut our base 
operating budget. That means 
layoffs, " said Moore.

On Dec. 13. the Tritons played their 
only road game of the break, smashing 
the Poets of Whinier College, 78-5 I. 
'That was a prenyeasy game for us, a loe 
like the Claremont game (a 77-6 1 win 
on Dec. 2)." UCSD Head Coo h Judy 
Malone said "We were up by 30 points 
early in the second half, so 1 pulled out 
all my starters. Everybody on the bench 
goea IOl ofplayingtime,·'Maloneadded. 

The Tritons didn't fare so well inthe 
UC San Diego Invitational tournament, 
held Dec. 28-30 at the Triton Gymna-
ium. In the opening round, UCSD was 

upset by orth Park (Dlinoi ), 85-72. 
The Tritons. leading 40-34 at 1k1lftime, 
were outscored 51-32 in the second 
half. "We were very disappointed, be-
cause we fully expected to win that 
game,"Malone said. Scholl led all scor-
ers with 28 poim . 

UCSD routed Amherst, 82-56, in 
the consolation semit.nal. The Tritons. 
leading 38-29 at halftime. broke it open 
in the second half to coast to an easy 
victory. Once again. UCSD wa;; paced 
by Scholl's 23 points and 12 rebounds. 

In the lifth-place game. the Tritons 
ran head-first into a brick wall called 
Augustana. a perennial Division ill 
power. Augu taro 's bruising. physical 
team dominated the 'maller UCSD 
squad for most of the first half. UCSO 
trailed at halftime, 32-21. 

TIle Tritons tayed close in the sec-
ond half. cutting Augustana' s lead to six 
points with four minutes remaining. 

UCSD' comeback bid fell shOll when 
Augu tana' defense stopped the Tri-
tons on three straight pos essions. 
Augustana held on to win, 5846, as the 
Triton running ganle lowed to acr.lwl. 

'ihey're a nationally-ranked team 
because they 're so deep. Most teams we 
play have only two or three outslatlding 
playen;. Augusmna hal seven or eight," 
Mnlonesaid 

"We came up again~1 a team that's 
very. very phy ical.lfwe want to be a 
national power. we need to leam how to 
play at that level," he said. 

"We do it in purrs, but being a 
young team, we tend to lose our ~ us." 
Malone added. 

Malone was nor pleased with the 
officiating in the 10 to Augustana. 
"The refs let everything go. There was 
a lot of pushing and shoving and they 
just let everything go. We didn't get a 
call in the paint all night. The officiating 
was just terrible." she said. 

The Triton (5-6) continue to inJ-
prove. getting more production from

After an injury-plagued season a 
year ago, Stillwell is starting to find the 
range. "Tricia's shoe is till a little bit 
shoosomelimesbecauseheriegstrength 
isn't quite there yet., but she's finding 
her groove," Malone said. 

The coach also praised sophomore 
Tami Ovialt for hertenacity on defense. 
"Oviatt w~ in double-figures in re-
bounds in all three games at the tourna-
ment. Because tearns are doubling on

IIB1J1 
The Fat Guy 
Brought Me Socks 

Ouistmas lost its meaning for me 
this year. 

II was Christmas morning and I 
received some socks as a gift. jlLSl Like 
alway . But- and thi i the scary 
pan- my fi~t thought was "Cool, I 
need some more ks." Then, with the 
impact of a runaway 18-wheeler, what I 
had just said hit me. I couldn't believe 
it. I g t ks, the perpetual bane of 
every kid 's Christma~ existence. and 
not only was I not disappointed, I 
actually appreciated them. When you 
strut thinking of socks as a highlight 
gift , the inevitable neKt ~ep is to thlUlk 
M>inebody for giving you a lump of 
clay they call an ashtrny. 

I got a jacket next. but, trying to 
cling to my fnsl-depaning youth. I 
forgot about it and pent a couple of 
hours playing wilh the cardboard boK it 
canle in instead. 

How about 1992? The year that 
was, well, if nothing else, 366 d.1Y 
long. Let's see, the Gi:Ults almo:.t 
moved to Shady Acres Arena in SI. 
Petersburg. where. in addition t hot 
dog and beer, they sell Super-Grip 
Polidem and black and or.lnge walkers. 

The Gi:Ulls were saved when 
Pittsbu~h slugger Barry Bonds bought 
the team from Safeway mogul Peter 
Magow:Ul who. technically, had a\ 
much right to sell the te.1J11 as a 
blueberry d:mish. In a MUlming public 
relations booMer, 800ds announced that 
not only does he own the te:un. but he 
wi ll pay himself based on a percentage 
of the national debl. 

In football, Washington defeated 
Buffalo 37-24 in the Super Bowl after 
Thurman Thomas. in n well publicized 
incident, lo, t his helmet at the begin-
ning of dle game and was Ullable to 
t.1rt as equipment managers frantically 
~arched for the mi ing head gear. 

It just wasn'tlllOmas' day. a.~ late 
~!1the game he was stopped at the goal 
line when the Redskins' Wilber 
Man.hall confused the nmning back by 
screaming "Your hoe's untied!" 
Several months later Thomas told a 
reporter that he was sick of discussing 
the lost-helmet in ident claiming tl13t 
everybody had forgotten about their 
clothing at one point in their lives. The 
interview had to be retaped. however. 
when it was discovered that the Buffalo 
.t.'If·s fly was open. 

The big sailing news was, of course, 
the exciting America' Cup racing 
action returning to San Diego, where it 
has evidently been going on continu-
ously since the 19th century. In an 
effort to speed things up, the race 
directors allowed the use of high 
explosives for the fir.>t time. 

Bluebeard the Pirate guided the Jolly 
Roger to victory, despite striking three 
limpet mines along the homestretch. 
Bluebeard's crewdefeated the pesky Stars 
and Stripes, using superior cannon fm: 
technique to blow the American ship out 
of the water. The four fans in attendance 
held their bre.1th waiting for news of the

Oregon State hammers UCSD 97-39 
as Tritons shoot only 19 percent 
By Gregg Wrenn 
Sports Editor 

It was the UCSD men' basketball 
te:un's :umuaJ chance to play with 
the big boys. The Tritons, who gen-
erally schedule one game a year 
against a Divi i n I opponcnt. trnv-
eled to Oregon State on Saturday. a 
huge step up from the likes of Cal 
Lutheran or Redl:uxls. The Bea-
vers chose this game (0 break out of 
a recent lump. setting a school 

record for victory margin by whipping the Tritons 97 -39. 
"In ganlCS like these. we're hoping to play above our 

level," UCSD Head Coach Tom Marshall said. "What 
you don't want to happen is forthern to play well and for 
u not to, but that' what happened" 

The Tritons, S-6 on the season. did not respood very 
well t the pressure. UCSDshot 19 pereent from the field, 
14 of 71, for the game and scored only 14 points in the 
second half.

was inconsi tent throughout the game, leading in

A High School Expatriot Reunion 
It was as if all myoId friends had their high school character sketches with them, because they acted 
their parts right on cue. There was Paul with the endless string of wise-ass comments. Scott was there 
too, finding ways to brag without appearing like he was trying to brag. And I found myself making 
the same comments about the same things to the same people that I did half a decade ago.

A High Sclwol Expatriot Reunion 
Rrst Person: A night out with the old 
gang reveals that four years after high 
chool graduation, people seem eerily the 
arne but inexplicably different. 

By David Snow 
Associate Feacures Editor 

It was as if alJ myoid friends had their high school character 
ketches with them. because they acted their p:uts right on cue. 

1l1ere was Paul with his endless string of wise- comments. 
Greg cautiously offen.'d hi d!y anecdotes, but was quiet most 
of the evening. Seon alway found ways to brag without 
appearing like he was trying 10 brag. And [ found myself 
making the sanle comments about the same things to the sanle 
people thaI [ did half a decade ago. 

During the course of the night. slight clues made il obvious 
that it really had been fou r years ince graduation, and that no 
amount of high school role-playing could make it a typical 
night out, the way we all remembered how it used to be. 

I was out with the guys, the crew. the gang, whatever you 
want to call them. They were thaI group of people thaI used 10 
hang out in frontofthelibrary, whom 
I would ask. on Friday afternoon. 
"So what 'sgoing on tonight?" know-
ing that I was included in their plans, 
and that they had no one else to do 
stuff with but each other. It was the 
same almost every weekend. 

My high school, like most 001-
ers, has a way of exporting most of 
its graduates to colleges in OI.her 
cities and stales. So Christmas and 
summer breaks provide periodic re-
unions during which my erstwhile classmates can check up on 
each others' progress and hit old stomping grotlIlCh. Our 
holiday-break-time companionship was one of both mutual 
experience and necessity. We could relate to each other 
because we were all el(panlOlS of the same hometown, bul 
more importantly, we still didn't know anyone at home except 
each other. 

We met atScon 's house last week, and the talk immediately 
turned 10 Bob, a classic figure in our circle of friends. He had 
left on Christmas day, having only seen a couple of people. 
Most of us hadn't seen him in four years. 

Bob had embodied the dark side of our group. He was a 
proud misogynist. cynical of any emotion OI.herthan cynicism, 
with a flair for cruel humor. All this made him a guilty pleasure 
to be around. He took his share of abuse, though, for being 
slightly ovcswcight and for always being caught trying to tell 
hopelessly embellished stories. Toward the end of our senior 
year, he stopped hanging wiIh us, claiming to have other Iiierxk 

with whom he wanted to spend time. 
Appropriately enough, he went to college in a hard-

edged cynical utopia, New York City. Though [never got a 
chance to see him over the holiday, I kept hearing about the 
"new Bob" from those who had - skinny, serious girl-
fiiend, loving life in the Big Apple. The rumor that he had 
been indicted for real estate fraud, he wanted us all 10 know, 
was not entirely 1nJe. 

BUI after four years, the old Bob was still recognizable in 
the new one. Paul and Scott took him oul the night before he 
left, and he had insisted they hould now call him "Rob." 
Even a game of half -court basketball had to be intenupted so 
that Bob could infonn his teanunate, "Rob. My name is 

. Rob." He had broken up with his girlfriend, and happily 
shared his grim view of the world with Scott and Paul as they 
had a drink later that night. His two friends laughed politely 
as he related tories of his ftrsl semester in law school, and 
as he lampooned the women we knew from high school. 

"So he' still the same?" I asked as we all siood around 
Scott's kitchen table. 

"Same old Bob," he said We all smiled and shook our 
heads, 'disappointed that we hadn't all gotten a chance to see 

him. WewereallslightJysadforhim 
as well. Teen angst is so much more 
appealing than adult binemess. 

The second question we are al-
ways asked by an old acquainrance 
is have we heard what so-and-so is 
doing. I can always be more candid 
discussing what I know about some-
one else's screwed-up plans than I 
can my own. 111ere is a sweet satis-
faction in discovering lhat othen; 
who set oul into the world at the 

same time as you are encountering the same problems. 
As we headed for our can;, we talked about who OUISide 

our circle was successful and who was wallowing in medi-
ocrity. Derek whal's-his-name was a Rhodes scholar, the 
bastard. But did you hear that Tom B., the guy who went to 
Cornell, is living at home and wailing tables in some seafood 
joint? No m:ntion was ever made of our own success rate 
in relation to each other. That was too sensitive an area. This 
is not to say lhal it wasn ' I carefully monitored. lluuughout 
the evening, questions were asked such as, "What exactly do 
you do in that job?" "How much longer do you have in 
school?" "Where did you get accepted?" The competition 
was subtle and Wlspoken, serving more to reassure ourselves 
than 10 pad our egos. 

Trevor suggestcd that we go to a bar by the local 
university which we had always been too young to get into. 
We all agreed to go. Trevor had always been the undisputed

Out With the Bad, 
In With the Worse 

SATIRE: Even the most astute }X)litical pundits and media analysts are at a 
loss to predict what 1993 holds in store, let alone explain what ~ned in 
1992. But if the following carefully-fonnulated predictions hold true, you 
may not be able to tear yourself from CNN all year. 
By PhIllip Mlc:haels 
Senior Staff Writer 

Nineteen ninery-(Wo is now languishing in the ash heap of years 
gone-by, and good riddance to it. The past year was about as welcome 
as an outbreak of acne on the night before Senior Prom, as enjoyable 
as a lengthy bout with salmonella From stan to fmish, 1992 was 
marked by chaos, rioes, mayhem and hatred - and that was onl y the 
Republican National Convention. 

Look back fora moment on thecavalcadeofmiscryand eluUlithat 
wallZed past us in 1992. If it wasn't the president losing hi lunch on 
foreign dignitaries, it was hung!)' Somalis looking for enough actual 
lunch to lose. While the rest of Europe bickered about reunification. 
lhe residents of what used to be Yugoslavia seuled their differences 
the old fashioned way - by shoocing each other. otlO be outdone. 
the citizens of Los Angeles took to the Streets in the larg t dome!.ri 
uprising in recent history. ineteen ninery-rwo was so hate-fiIl00 that 
even late night talk show hosts were at each other's throats. 

And as if all of that weren 'tenough to label 1992 asa kidney Slone 
of a year, we also had to deal with a presidential election. bringing 
with it a veritable slew of second-rate politicians with delusions of 
grandeur. 111<: ensuing melee br ught us an endlCl>S stream of 
crunpaign promi~. presidential debates and character assassina-
tions. It wa:. so bad that Ross Perot. Pat Buchanan and. God help us 
all. Jerry Brown were, at some point. considered fit to be 1~lC!er of the 
free world. 

But all that'~ behind us now. Nineteen ninety-two is little more 
than a fading memory, a light hangover pounding against 'iety's 
collective s}.:ull. The only question that remains i what does the 
coming year hold . Will 1993 bring us the same steady diet of 
calamity that 1992 hoved down our throats? Who can say for sure? 
But using advanced scientific techniques, complex trigonometric 
equations, advancoo logarithmic data and a real ly good ouija board, 
we can sure as heck guess.

purchased forwhich occasion, and where 
it would be onsumed. He usually drank 
the lion's share himself. He was the 
most likely to get himselfandevel)'one

ever-<lude" surfer disposition, he had a 
pervasive streak of 5pirituality in him 
that always puzzled and amu5ed us. He 
could ~ ily ~witch from relating a bois-

a beat. 

At the bar I bought Trevor a 
drink, an orange juice. After four 
years of college drinking. Trevor 
declared himself an alcoholic and 
joined AA Noone drank vel)' much 
that night, probably because Trevor 
wasn't egging us on anymore. 

Trevor left the table to go play 
darts with his girlfriend, who was 
staying with him over the holiday . 
Paul scowled and :u.ked retorically. 
"Why is it th.1t Trevor always attmcts 
rich. beautiful girls"" Allof us had noted 
that his girlfriend was indeed attr:lCtive 
and apparently quite wealthy. but we 
had all kept quiet about it. "It was the 
same thing in highschool. with Rebecca. 
How does he do it?" Paul had a girl-
friend at Stanford, but never missed a 
chance to broadcast his jealousies.

Everyone exchanged friendly 
nods of acknowledgement, but 

the cliques remained as

Pau I' knack for making outrageous 
comments and embarrassing observa-

when he wasn't around. At different 
points in time, everyone at the table had

still raised theireyCl> heavenward when· 
ever he said something deliberately in-

ure in these reunions because he alway 
organized them and made the call , 
often badgering US until we agreed to

at all our activities in high school even 
when most of us were ready to kill him. 

At the club that night we saw other

REUNION: Old 
acquaintances trade 
life stories 
ContInued from pace 56 
dered? 

I ran down the list of people from her 
circle of friends th.1t I wanted to be 
updated about, and then she quizzed me 
about people [ might be up on. But 
beyond that. the mall talk became lim-
ited. We both knew there was no way 
we could. in a diSlTacted barroom 
conver.;ation. convey all the changes. 
decisions, experiences and people that 
h3d haped four years of our lives. 11le 
end product seemed the quickest indi-
cator: what are you doing now? What 
are you like now? 

She asked me about Justin. who was 
ittingoveratmytable. We calledJustin 

Grunt. G.£. Joe. avy Boy, because he 
always said he wanted togo to the Naval 
Academy. and that , wherehewent.He 
said he wanted a career as a commander 
in the Navy. and that 's what he' doing 
right now. Justin never got angl)' . al-
ways put up with our civilian humor, 
and always knew whm he was going to 
do next. one of us wanted to do what 
he was doing. but it was quietly a -
knowledged that he was a model of pure 
success. and we envied him for it. [ 
enthusiastically told this to her. noting 
all the lin Ie honors he had stacked up in 
the Navy so far. ·Wow." he agreed. 

Weallchucklednervously about the 
large number of once ambitious people 
who had ended up returning home to 

The UC D Guardian 

live with their parents and who were 
busing our tables, making espresso and 
mixing our drinks. The laughter wasn't 
all arrogance. though. because we un-
der.;tood that some of us - Dan. and 
Lyle - were doing the same thing. It 
was transitional. One thing we all had in 
common was uncertainty about our fu-
ture, though we Died to laugh it off in 
each other's company. Once a per.;on 
grJduates from college. things get even 
more complicated. more up in the air. 

The people who had retumed home 
had done so to insure that this trJJlsition 
was in the most seemingly fanliliar 
place of all. If only home were the way 
they remembered it from high school. 
they could feel secure. At home. they 
had the flawed but comforting notion 
that they knew what to expect next.
