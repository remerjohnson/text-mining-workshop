Resolution Calls For Recognition 
Of Student Employees By UC 
By CATHERINE DILLE 
News Editor 

The California state Senate 
recently approved a measure re-
Questing that the University of 
California end discrimination 
against student employees on the 
basis of their status as students, 
and to research and make recom-
mendations on a variety of prob-
lems faced by academic student 
employees. 

The resolution. sponsored by 
the University of California Stu-
dent Association (UCSA) and 
authored by Senator Diane Wat-
son. says that "despite their essen-
tial role in the operation of the 
University. student employees are 
denied rights and benefits accorded 
to all other University employees. 
including health insurance. solely 
on the basis of their student status. " 

The resolution, should it go 

into effect. would "strongly en-
courage" the UC Regents "to not 
discriminate against University 
employees on the basis of student 
status with respect to the applica-
tion of personnel policies. provi-
sion of benefits. and other rights. 
benefits and privileges related to 
employment. " 

Lee Butterfield. spokesperson 
for the UCSA. said that in addition 
to changing the statu of Univer-
sity student employees. the resolu-
tion requests that the UC "study a 
variety of [problems facing RAs 
and T As] . such as inadequate griev-
ance procedures . . . and the rela-
tionship between job descriptions 
and actual duties." 

Butterfield said that the proc-
ess through which student employ-
ees get their positions also needs 
re-evaluating. 

RA and T A positions are "never 
posted. it's a r:natter of who you 
know. You get stuck with the old

Chimes Given To UCSD 
By CATHERINE DILLE 
News Editor 

Hearing bells? A computer-
ized carillon installed atop 
Central Library was donated 
Sept. 20 by a 95-year-old La 
Jolla man as a memorial to his 
recently deceased wife. 

The bells were the gift of 
Joseph Rubinger in remem-
brance of his wife. Irene. who 
died last February. The Rubin-
gers were founders of the Insti-
tute for Continued Learning 
(ICL). which is run through 
UCSD Extension. 
"I could think of no more suit-

able memorial for Irene than

chimes."Rubinger said. "When 
I was an undergraduate and 
graduate I was brought up on 
chimes at my university. I could 
notconceiveof a university with-
out chimes." 

Rubinger's gift will be known 
as "the ICL/lrene Rubinger Me-
morial Carillon." 

The ICL. founded 15 years 
ago. provides retired and semi-
retired members of the commu-
nity with the opportunity to fur-
ther their education through 
classes taught by their own 
members. as well as by guest 
speakers. Its schedule includes 
classes on such diverse topics as

Stephen Arditti. the director 

of State Governmental Relations 
for the University of California. 
pointed out that studies to alleviate 
problems such as these would be 
done at great expense to the Uni-
versity. 

In a leller 10 Senator Diane 
Watson. Arditti said that. "The 
resolution asks. in certain instances. 
for information which is not cur-
rently available without substan-
tial added expense. Information , 
for example. on time-to-degree 
for student employees cannot be 
obtained withoutconductingcostly 
surveys of graduating or former 
students." 

Arditti also said that the UC 
would not willingly comply with 
the section of the resolution that 
says a student employee "policy

University administrators. staff. 
and representative of appropriate 
student and student employee as-
sociations. "

Senior Staff Writer 

The $500,000 remodeling of the 
old Student Center is nearing 
completion. despite delays which 
have inconvenienced some student 
organizations. 

The remodeling project. which 
began in April and was scheduled 
for completion by Sept 25. will 
not be finished for several more 
weeks. according 10 Asst Director 
of the Student Center Ron Carlson. 

"We've had to readjust the 
schedules." Carlson said. because 
of "things that took longer than 
expected." 

Carlson said the delays were 
mostly the result of "typical oc-
currences in remodeling jobs," 
such as problems arising from find-
ing unexpected plumbing and elec-
trical wiring in the buildings. 

Carlson added that asbestos had 
to be removed from areas where it 
would be disturbed by the remod-
eling work. 

"In the places that had exten-

intact in the ceiling. where it is the Student Center and the Price

According to S.R. Jones at

There is "a definite lack of 

communication" between Soft

she had "not been personally con-

She added that it is "rather dis-

have to move a second time, to its

Water Torture 

Dealing With Drought 
"In the West, whiskey is for drinking but water is for 
fighting over." - Mark Twain 

This is the third dry year in a row in California. Water 
rationing is common in Northern California. 

It isn't the first drought, and political leaders at every level of 
government have had decades to work out a rational water 
management program. Yet we still have a policy which is fuU of 
inequity, waste, and downright stupidity. 

At UCSD, it isn 'I hard to fmd examples of waste. According 
to a recent report on campus growth, UCSD consumes 905 
gallons of water per minute . This number is probably much 
higher when the Price Center fountain is running and drenching 
most of the central plaza. Broken sprinklers shoot water into the 
air, and even the working ones send much of their water onto the 
concrete. 

But in California, urban users only account for 17 percent of 
the water use - the other 83 percent is consumed by agriculture. 
According to a column by Peter PasseU in the August 3, 1988 
edition of the New York Times ,fannersin the central valleys pay 
as little as $10 to irrigate an acre of cotton, while a few hundred 

miles away in Los Angeles, local authorities pay as much as $600 
for the same amount of water. That amount will supply three 
families for one year. 

Without incentives to conserve, agribusinesses simply don't 
save water. 'The huge agricultural subsidies result in the planting 
of the wrong crops, use of less productive land, heavy use of 
pesticides and chemical fertilizers, construction of more dams, 
and very inefficient use of water. Techniques which control 
runoff to prevent soil loss and pollution also conserve water, but 
the politician who proposes measures to force fanners to pay a 
fair price for water faces a powerful lobby. 

But fanners must be given an incentive to conserve, and 
hitting them in the pocketbook is one of the best methods. An 
alternative method is to give them rights to the water they use, 
then allow them to auction water off to the highest bidder. Either 
method applies market forces to reduce agricultural use of water, 
a much more effective method than stacJcing more laws on top of 
the legislation which is alreadydistoning the market so severely. 

The Sierra Oub estimates that a two percent decrease in the 
use of water in farming would provide the urban areas in 
California with an extra year's supply of water. Fanners can 
change their fanning techniques, line their canals to avoid 
seepage, drill wells, and rotate low-quality land out of produc-
tion. 

The use of the market in water allocation has another advan-
tage over the political process: it allows small fanners to benefit, 
since they don't have the political clout of large agribusinesses. 
Farming methods which conserve water and use less chemical 
aids (which a redesigned, minimal subsidy sy tem would en-
courage) are beneficial to small fanners, since they require more 
intensive management - something hired managers at large 
corporate fanns would be less able to accomplish. 

It is undeniable that conserving water is everyone's job. But 
in order to make real progress, the largest users have to have 
incentives to use les . water. Redesigning both our water policy 
and our fann policy is the only way to accomplish this.

A Shaven Head Hidden in Shame 
By DA V1D WYNER, MalllJging Editor 

It's always struck me how certain memories can 
just pop back to the forefront of your mind for no 
apparent reason and re-teach an imponant lesson. 

They're the kind of memories that you don't 
really want to remember, but that tempt you with the 
mysterious allure of something left unresolved. 

This weekend I remembered something I saw 
when I was no more than 10 or U. It was so long ago 
I thought the whole incident would have faded inlO 
a dreamlike haze. But it hasn't. The details are as 
clear today as they were then. 

Looking back, what happened wasn't at all earth-
shattering. Far from it. What I saw was merely a 
human reaction to an uncomfortable situation. It was 
profound in its simplicity and at the same time 
captivating in its power. 

This particular memory took me back 10 a sum-
mer day I spent ata park with my family. I was busy 

q 

' . 

doing whatever little boys do on jungle gyms when a 
group of young female Buddhists wearing traditional 
ropes walked silently by. 

As they did, their shaved heads attracted the stares 
and giggles of the kids on the playground. I can't 
remember if I stared. I may have. But when the others 
began 10 point and giggle at the bald women, I began 
to notice something. 

The women all walked past the laughing children 
with the dignity and self-assurance of people who 
were content with themselves and the paths they had 
chosen. All of them, that is, except one. 

She broke her contemplative stare and, with a 
worried look, turned her attention to the children. It 
was as though she knew their whispers were about 
her, but was somehow hoping 10 be wrong. 

When her fears were confirmed, she became 
embarrassed and, with a shamed look, hurried to hide

NEW YORK - There was a time not so 
long ago when Americans were appalled, 
angered, even frightened by a menace from 
abroad, whose power to do evil was un-
questionably real. The entire nation seemed 
to believe that his menace WIIS threatening 
our youth, sapping our national will, ... . 
throwing into doubt our very future. 

Because we responded to this threat out 
of fear rather than with prudence, because 
we failed to put this threat into context, we 
went . through something approaching a 
national hysteria. 

Thirty-five years ago, of course, the 
threat was not drugs but communism. No 
one looking at what was happening back 
then in the Soviet Union or Eastern Europe 
could feel anything but horror at the prospect 
of a "Sovietized" United States. 

But that horror turned into a full-fledged 
paniC that vastly overstated that threat. and 
came close at times to threatening the self-
confident, exuberant sense that is the essence 
of American politics. 

For example, in 1950 the state of Indiana 
demanded that anyone seeking to enter a 
certain line of employment be required to 
sign a loyalty oath. The profession? 
Professional wrestling. (presumably, the 
legislator feared that a KGB-trained 
combatant would take the championship 
away from Argentine Rocca, thus 
undermining the confidence of the West.) 

In 1958, New York state passed 
something called The Subversive Drivers 
Act, stripping the right to drive from those

convicted of violating val ious anti-
subversive laws - the better to protect us 
from unauthorized vehicular terrorism better 
left to New York City cabdrivers. 

Today, our fear - our obsession -
involves drugs. They are, to be sure, a 
genuine evil, with the capacity to hurt a 
great number of people, just about all of 
whom inflict this damage on themselves. 
The horrors inflicted on innocent victims 
by addicts robbing for money, or by drug 
gangs seeking a monopoly of drug profits, 
or by foreign drug merchants, stem directly 

the most fertile field to discover such 
hysteria. Remember in 1986, during the last 
epidemic of drug fever, when candidates 
produCed results of their drug tests and 
challenged their opponents to do the same? 

Well now, in the midst of a special 
congressional election in Texas, state Rep. 
Ron Wilson proposed "an amendment to 
the U.S Constitution requiring candidates 
for all elected federal offices to undergo 
drug testing." (For good measure, Rep. 
Wilson wants the state constitution amended 
to require the same tests for candidates for

from the illegality of drugs. 
They do, in fact, pose a threat to the next 

generation, especially if we parents have 
failed in our essential task of armoring our 
children from the temptation of instant 
gratification (though the instinct of every 
younger generation to do dumb things is 
something close to genetically imbedded). 

But we are already seeing signs that 
something approaching a national hysteria 
is smothering our effort to deal with this 
dilemma rationally. 

As is often the case, the political arena is 

statewide office). 
That's right - along with free speech, 

freedom of religion, right to a fair trial, 
there'd be another powerful symbol of our 
unique form of government: a liquid-filled 
boule. 

Granted, one crackpot idea from a minor 
political figure may be just one straw in the 
wind, but it is not the only straw. 

What, for instance, are we to think of the 
rhetoric of Sen. loeBi den, who says that we 
need a "D-Day" approach to the war on 
drugs, rather than Bush's "Vietnam''? 

The latter part of that rhetorical device is 
fine: 'The "drug war" does look like a 
campaign of muddled objectives, fused with 
hiJhly dubious tactics, with the danger of 
an ever-esc:alating involvement, this time 
in the Andean jungles. 

But what would a "D-Day" approach 
mean? Wauld it mean the use of the National 
Guard in our city streets? The kind of 
mandatory death penalty for mere drug 
possession that now operates in Malaysia? 

Those concepts at least have the chance 
of being effective. But is that the kind of 
cost to our traditional political system that 
we are willing to pay in this "war',? 

What are we to think of an impulse to be 
on the "right" side of the war on drugs that 
has persuaded all three networks to produce 
and air the same anti-drug message for 
children at the same time? Are we really 
. pleased to see such unanimity in the face of 
government initiative? Should our mass 
media really be so eager to define as the key 
crisis in the land whatever the White House 
decides is this year's key crisis? Doesn't 
"adversarial journalism" mean bringing a 
critical, even skeptical, eye not just to a 
president's proposals but to his agenda as 
well? 

Thirty-five years ago, we saw the danger 
of uncritical enthusiasm for a crusade, even 
against so noxious an evil as communism. 
We need that critical sense today, even 
against an evil like drugs. 

Otherwise, sooner or later, someone is 
going to propose replacing the torch of 
freedom in the Statue of Liberty's right 
hand with a bottle labeled "drug free."

her baldness under her long cloak. 
But, her attempts at escaping ridi-
cule went in vain, as the children 
continued to laugh and point until 
!he group was out of sight. 

The incident took only a few 
moments, and the one Buddhist's 
reaction was over before I truly 
understood its signifICance. In the 
days that followed, though, I 
thought quite a bit about that 
woman and what her shame had 
taught me. 

No disease oractofGod caused 
her baldness. It was her choice 10 
shave her head and live a strict 
religious life. But, it was clear 10 
me she was not comfonable with 
that choice. 

I've come 10 understand, then, 
what she was really hiding was 
not her bald head at all , but rather 
!he way oflife which her baldness 
represented. 

That day I realized, perhaps for 
the ftrst time in my life, that the 
hardest decision one must make is 
!he choice of what kind of person 
to be. 

I realized also that once you've 
made that decision, it is crucial 
that you understand and are con-
tent with your choice. 

That woman obviously was not 
It looked as though she did under· 
stand what kind of person she 
wanted to be, but that she had not 
made peace with herself about that 
decision .. 

I'm not suggesting that being 
sure of yourself and your way of 
life is at all easy, especially in the 
face of jeers and stares from people 
who don't agree or understand. 

I wish I could say I've taken the 
Buddhist's lesson and am now 
completely comfortable with 
myself. Bull can 't.lknow myself 
and I understand the decisions I've 
made about my life, but I don't 
always feel sure of myself. 

I still look over my shoulder 
when I hear somebody giggle, and 
I still find myself apologizing for 
what I do and don't like. 

Just like the Buddhist who 
covered her head in an auemptlO 
mask her way of life, I sometimes 
try to hide from other aspects of 
myself that I am not yet comfon· 
able with. 

I don't like big parties and I 
don't always go out on Saturday 
nights, but that's just pan of me 
and I shouldn't be ashamed of it. 
Yet I can't help but feel a twinge 
of embarrassment when others 
stan talking about the parties they 
went to and the people they met 
over the weekend. 

Since I was sixaeen, I 'veknown 
what I wanted 10 do and the kind 
oflifestyle I want when I'm older. 
Achieving my goals isn't going 10 
be easy. I know that and I've sac· 
rificed a lot of good times for 
some hard work and long hours. 
We've all made similar sacrifices 
and decisions. 

I just hope that someday I won' t 
apologize for, and hide, my bald· 
ing head.

Continued from page 6 
Soviet Union, butdidn ' tcare until 
Gorbachev started admitting it. 

We want pictures, we want neat 
stories and we want Ihem fast. 
We're not interested inan in-depdt 
analysis of mismanagement (or 
no management) at HUD in 1987, 
but when it hits the fan and 
everyone's shouting "Scandal'" 
it's suddenly worth paying atten-
tion to. 

We care more about the execu-
tive branch than the legislati ve or 
congressional, even though the 
latter has much more important 
effects on our lives. But the ex-
ecutive branch is easy to under-
stand; we can see photo opportu-
nities of one man , and we know 
about his wife, and the nameofhis 
dog. 

Butthese short, simplistic view-
points can 't hold our attention very 
long; we grasp them, we're in-
trigued, then we move 00. And 
forget Most of the world lives in 
poverty and oppression. But we 
don't reatly care most of the time, 
and when we do, it's only for as 
long as it takes Dan Rather to tell 
us about it. 

This isn't new. Our generation 
may have shorter attention spans 
than previous ones, but they for--
got too. The generations before 
ours sat by while Hitler rebuilt 
Gennany's military might, think-
ing if they ignored it. it would go 
away. A few generations before 
that, most people ignored slavery 
until a war thrust it into their con-
sciences. 

So maybe we have 10 be a little 
fatalistic. We can try harder to be 
concerned, we can join Amnesty 
International (though as the 
memory of the concens fades, we 
let the membership lapse) and we 
can become poIiticatly active. It's 
unliltely we' U make any pogress. 
but we have to try. 

AsI left the bookstore, I thought 
about buying one of those books 
about China; it would sit on my 
coffee table and remind me of 
what happened in Tianarunen. But 
then I decided not to. 

Quotables 
"People like the exposure 
of wickedness... in high 
places. It gives them a 
sense of ultimate 
righteousness of the 
world ... the squirming of 
those who are caught 
allows people to indulge 
in a certain legitimate 
sadism which , otherwise, 
they would feel obliged to 
suppress." 
John Kenneth Galbraith 

"There is perhaps no 
phenomenon which 
contains so much 
destructive feeling as 
moral indignation, which 
permits envy or hate to 
be acted out under the 
guise of virtue."

cated between Tioga and Tenaya 
Halls, by the trash dumpsters in the 
Muir Apartments and by the park-

lege. 

Monday, September 25, 1989 

A program to encourage recy-
cling at Muir Residence Halls was 
recently implemented by five Muir 
College students. 

In lhe residence hall at Muir 

College, students will find that 
containers for paper, glass and 
aluminum have been placed on 
each floor. House recycling repre-
sentati ves will empty the contain-
ers on a rotational basi ,at one of 
two recycling centers for new pa-
per and aluminum. Igloos for col-

Kathy Nielsen and Jana Carey, 
two of the students responsible for 
the recycling project, agree that 
sLarling the program was not diffi-
cult, it just took time.

tion encourages lhe recycling pro-
gram . Assistant Resident Dean of 
Muir College Kathie Poffsaid lhat 
this program is the first step inedu-
cating Muir students,as well as the 
entire UCSD campus, about the 
necessity of clean ing up the envi-
ronment by reducing pollution , 
saving energy and precious re-
sources and preventing recyclable 
material from going into landfills. 

Since there are containers on 
each fl oor of lhe residence halls, 
students will find recycling very 
convenient, said first year Muir 
student Scott Muller. 

Assistant Dean of Revelle Col-
lege Lorna Hirae said that Revelle 
is looking into a recycling pro-
gram as well. 

The Revelle Residence Halls 
presently do not have bins because 
the administration is afraid that the 
cans will awact insects, and stu-
dent volunteers are needed to empty 
the bins on a weekly basis. Hirae 
said. 

Nielsen said lhe bins at Muir 
College are lined to deter insects, 
and weekly emptying of the bins 
will help eliminate problems. 

Kim Motta, a sophomore at 
Revelle College, said that it is nec-
essary to have bins on the floors of 
the residence halls there, because 
the igloos located at the parking lot 
entrance to Revelle College are 
too inconvenient for recycling ef-
fOrLs. 

Motta said she felt that some 
Revelle students would be willing 
to form a committee to ensure lhat 
bins would be emptied as in the 
Muir program. 

The individuals participating 
will not receive money for recy-
cling. 

Nielsen said that the newspaper 
and aluminum profits will be given 
to lhe UCSD Recycle Co-op, and 
the proceeds from the recycled 
glass will go to Muir College 
Recycling. 

The profits obtained from the 
recycled glass will be used to hel" 
expand the recycling program at 
the Muir Apartments, and excess 
profits will be used to plan house 
socials and ice cream parties. 

An incentive program has also 
been fonned to reward the house 
or houses which makes lhe largest 
contribution to the recycling pro-
gram. 

Nielsen and Carey predict suc-
cess for the recycling program. 

Nielsen said that the program is 
"just a start," but she feels that if 
Muir students recycle, olher col-
leges will implement similar pro-
grams.

take responsibility for lhe work 
product of a committee composed 
of represenratives of various con-
stituent groups. We would pr0-
pose, therefore. that it be left to the 
University to determine the most 
practical and effective means for 
conducting the desired study," 
Arditti added. 

Butterfield said. however, that 
the UCSA would object to a policy 
committee that would not include 
students. 

"The reason [Regents) have 
these problems is lhat they have 
not listened to students. Now they 
want to malee anolher report with 
no student input," Butterfield said. 

Butterfield said that the main 
concerns of the student employees 
are lhat they do not recieve health 
benefits, and that time spent work-
ing as a student employee does not 
count toward retirement benefit 
eligibility should they laterbe hired 
by the UC as faculty. 

Butterfield feels that students 
would be "encouraged to become 
faculty because of these retirement 
benefits. " 

The Regents cited the high 
costs as reason for not providing 
benefits in the past. 

The University's "number one 
concern wilh the legislation is 
money. It would cost a fabulous 
amount of money to pay for these 
benefits. I would guess it would 
cost about $4 million." However. 
the University "says it would cost 
$25 million" foralllhe TA andRA 
benefits, Butterfield said. 

Arditti said that, "The 
resol0tion's directive that the 
Regents not discriminate against 
University employees on the basis 
of student status could be

An American in Beiiin~ 

San Diego Professor Recalls China Experience 
By ADAM LEVY 
StafJWriUT 

Jimi Hendrix and MTV may 
be commonplace names for the 
average American college stu-
dent.. To Chinese students on the 
mainland, however, they border 
on the strange and the alluring. 

Larry McCaffery ,a professor 
at San Diego Stale University 
who has also taught classes at 
UCSD, introduced these classic 
symbols of American pop cul-
ture when he taught English-
speaking Chinese students at the 
Uni versity of Beijing this past 
year. 

He said the music of Hendrix 
was "horrifying" to them because 

of its "loud, chaotic and sexual" 
undertones . MTV elicited an 
equally perplexed reaction with 
its "rapid-fire pacing." 

"One of the fun things about 
being [in Beijing) ," Professor 
McCaffery said, "was that chal-
lengeoftryingtotalkaboutsome-
body like Jimi Hendrix in a con-
text so that they might understand 
what was going on." Students 
failed 10 understand the symbol-
ism and background meaning of 
rock and roll, he said. 

As another example of cultural 
differences, the students were 
unmoved by the sym bol of the car 
and open road, an image that has 
come to represent freedom in this 
country. In the same way, he said 

that his students ~ only an ab-
stract view of democracy, since, 
like rock music, it also has been 
imported from the West 

McCaffery, who has special-
ized in contemporary American 
fiction, went to China as a 
Fulbright professor. He was thus 
able to send his materials uncen-
sored via special diplomatic ar-
rangements. This gave him the 
flexibility to expose student!l 1.0 
controversial literature and films 
thal would have been censored 
olherwise.

manner so as 10 portray both

For Two UCSD Students, ~ 
It Was a Year to Remember ~

Features Editor 

"Every night you could hear 
the students singing. It just kind of 
snowballed. More and more stu· 
dents joined the protests. Students 
from outlying communities came. 
They would usually start at night 

with some students and [one] 
poinled to the China daily 
[news]paper and she said that that 
man died," explained Warren 
senior Christena Leverton, the 
other UCSD student in Beijing last 
year. 

The man to whom the Chinese 
student referred was Hu Yao-Bang. 

According to Erik Humphrey, who spent last school year in 
Beijing. the Chinese students wanted political reform: "They felt 
that the present government, the [officials) and the policies of the 
time were a little out of touch with the desires of the people: 

and then as people got bolder, it 
was during the day. IL was amaz-
ing to see the output of energy the 
students and the people had." 

Not many Americans experi-
enced Tiananmen Square the way 
Third College junior Erik 
Humphrey did. Humphrey was 
one of only two UCSD students 
studying abroad at the University 
of Beijing when the protests broke 
oul this past spring. 

"One day I went on a picnic. 

a former Communist Party leader 
who lost power a few years ago 
after failing to take harsh action 
against students involved in the 
more low-keyed 1986 demonstra-
tions. Leverson attributes Ihe be-
ginning of the uprising to Hu 's 
death. 

'This [protest] was very spe-
cial because it wasn't just the stu-
dents and the intellectuals. It was 
the common working [people] and 
farmers who were also part of it," 

Humphrey said. 
Noting that the Chinese "treat 

foreigners very well," he did not 
feel that he was in danger in Bei-
jing. "If anything. safer," he added. 

Leverson had a different per-
ception of her role as a foreigner. 
"I didn ' t really participate because 
it's not my country or my leaders," 
she explained. "You believe in what 
they're doing. You give them ver-
bal support, but I can't go march-
ing holding a sign, because I'm not 
Chinese." 

According to Humphrey, the 
students had an idealized picture 
of Western democratic society. "I 
think mostly what they saw was 
the glamorized version of the West. 
They have a few American TV 

A visiting professor at the University of Beijing, Larry McCaffery 
was able to introduce Chinese students to literature and films that 
would ordinarily be prohibited in China. 
shows over there and stuff always 
looks really good on TV. What 
they saw of foreigners was the rich 
tourists travelling around in lux-
ury on the buses and airplanes, 
staying in the really nice hotels." 

Both Leverson and Humphrey 
felt that many students held only 
an abstract idea of democracy, yet 
knew that they wanted better 
housing conditions and higher 
status for intellectuals. 

"The students told me that they 

didn't want to overthrow the gov-
ernment. " Humphrey said. "They 
wanted changes within the Com-
munistParty. A lot of the students 
were Communists. They felt that 
the present government, the [offi-
cials] and the policies of the time 
were a little out of touch with the 
desires of the people."

Academic Internships Offer 
Education with a Twist 
By CHRIS LEEMASTER 
COnlribuJing Writer 

This past summer, some UCSD 
students opted for a little variety in 
their Ii ves. They decided to forego 
a traditional summer job and lOOk: 
on internships wilh an entertain-
ment agency and NASA to gain 
career-related experience and ex-
tend their knowledge beyond their 
coursework. 

Lauren Stearns, a senior ma-
joring in biology, was chosen with 
35 other students out of a pool of 
600 students nationwide to par-
ticipate in NASA's Space Life 
ScienccsTraining Program for six 
weeks beginning in late June. 

The program, at the Kennedy 
Space Center in Florida, exposed 
Stearns to ongoing NASA experi-
ment labs "which basically study 
the effects of zero gravity on 
humans," she stated. 

Stearns participated in a total 
of six labs, one of which measured 
the effects of zero gravity on the 

cardiovascular system, while an-
other measured plant growth in 
zero gravity. She also attended 
lectures given by NASA scientists 
and astronauts. 

Stearns is interested in a pos-
sible career in space life sciences. 

'Internships allow 
students to gain ca-
reer-related experi-
ence and look good 
on a resume.' 

Christine Alexander 
and deemed the internship "defi-
nitely worthwhile" because it gave 
her hands-on experience in the field . 

At the same time back on the 
We~t Coast, fellow UCSD student 
Andrew Robbins, a senior major-
ing in communications, served as 
an assistant 10 an entertainment 
agent based here in San Diego. 

Robbins' internship was of-

fered through the Academic In-
ternship Office at UCSD. He 
received four units of upper divi-
sion credit while learning the ins 
and outs of the entenainment 
world of screenwriting. 

"I did a little of everything" 
from punching holes in scripts to 
reviewing screenplays for poten-
tial negotiations, Robbins com-
mented. 

As part of the Academic In-
ternship program, Robbins had 
to work a minimum of 10 hours a 
week and write a final paper on 
his experience. His final project 
turned out to be learning the do's 
and doo'tsofsubmitting a screen-
play to Comedy Inc .• the agency 
for which he worked. 

Robbins says he is interested 
in a writing career, but is not sure 
exactly what aspect of the field 
he will go ilno. His internship 
gave him insight into screen-
writing, and he says he will most 
likel y take another internship in a

different area as weD. 

With Stearns' and Robbins' 
examples, it is no wonder intern-
ships are catching on as a viable 
way to get ahead career-wise. 

"Internships allow students to 
gain career-relatedexperience and 
look good on a resumt," said 
Christine Alexander, inremship 
coordinator for the Career Serv-
ices Center (CSC). Her office 
poslSlistingson the pan-time em-
ployment board, which have ei-
ther been phoned in or mailed to 
CSC. 

She posts both internship as 
well as Cooperative Educational 
positions. Cooperative Education 
usually requires students to take 
three to six months off from 
school, but the trade-off is intense 
wort experience and many con-
tacts. 

Internships, on the other hand, 
allow students to work while still 
in school. 

''The majority of internships 
and Cooperative Education [p0-
sitions] pay a competitive hourly 
rate," she pointed out 

Alexander also offers drop-in 
counseling hotn Monday through 
Friday from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. 

In addition to the CSC, stu-
dents may also visit the Academic 
Internship OffICe and the Associ-
aIed Students Internship OffICe 
(ASIO), which are specifICally 
designed to link UCSD students 
wilh internships. 

The Academic Internship 
Office offers studehts a chance to 
receive up to 16 units of upper 
division credit for completing an 
internship. To qualify, one must 
have completed 90 units or more.

lations and laboratory research. 

have Iaken some upper~vision 
classes related to an internship, 
and maintained a 2.5 GPA or 
higher. 

The program works with local 
as well as national corporations 
such as ABC News (Washington 
D.C.), Kodak, Sheraton Hotels, 
KGTV Channel 10, and the 
mayor's offICe. 

The Associated Students Intern-
ship Office also provides local and 
national internships. The ASIO 
program offers both paid and vol-
unteer internships in three demo-

graphic areas: San Diego, state-
wide, and nationwide. Students 
who have completed one full quar-
ter and have maintained a 2.0 GPA 
are eligible. 

Brent Malloy, student director 
of the ASIO, said they also help 
students create their own intern-
ships with companies not already 
affiliated with AS 10, through their 
development program. The pr0-
gram is staffed by student volun-
teers who assist prospective in-
ternees in the application and in-
terview processes.

According to McCaffery, the 
issues that have driven the Chi-
nese to rebel, however, are far 
deeper than material desires. 

As he explained, alienation 
toward the regime among intellec-
tuals and students is deep-seated 
as a result of the eyents of the Cul-
tural Revolution of the lale 1960s, 
during which time there was wide-
spread persecution of intellectu-
als. Many Chinese likened it to the 
Holocaust in regard to the degree 
of repress ion that the state inflicted. 

'Once we were in 
the dorms~ I was sur-
prised at how radical 
their ideas were.' 

Larry McCaffery 

In the classroom this past year, 
the students rarely spoke out. 
McCaffery said. Most of the unin-
hibited conversation took: place in 
thedonnitoriesorin the professor' s 
aparunent. It was at these times 
that the students freely criticized 
theregime,educationalsyslem,and 
the country' s priorities. 

"Once we were in the dorms, I 
was swprised at how radical their 
ideas were," he said, noting that 
the group never felt as if it were 
being monitored. 

According to Professor McCaf-
fery. the students were frusuated 
by the low value inteUectuals were 
given, as demonstrated in economic 
terms. A graduate student receives

Conti nued from page 18 

in tenement buildings in which 
five or six students share a room 
and an entire floor shares a bath-
room without hot waler. Profes-
sionals with graduate degrees, in-
cluding high-ranking intellectu-
als such as heart surgeons, can 
expectLO cam one-tenth of a taxi 
driver's salary. 

In addition, they resent that the 
government maintains control 
over their future . In China, one is 
told where to work and is prohib-
ited from quitling one's job. In 
terms of their personal lives , the 
Chinese are not allowed to marry 
residents of other cities. 

"They see this disparity be-
tween the ideals that the party 
proclaims versus the reality that's 
going on there," McCaffery said. 
The students looked negatively 
upon such party extravagances as 
stretch limousines and elegant 
banquets and deemed the party's 
political favoritism a form of 
corruption. 

The students' angerreached its 
peak on April 8, the day they went 
on strike. The historic weeks that 
followed were watched by much 
of the world. 

McCaffery attended the May 
demonstrations at Tiananmen 
Square almost daily "in the back-
ground," and like most foreign-
ers, "absorbed with greatadmira-
tion and enthusiasm from a dis-
IaIlce." He partook in extensive 
nightly discussions with the stu-
dents about the day' s events. 

"All of the foreigners were 
aware of the dangers of involving 
ourselves," McCaffery said.1bere 
was the risk that "the government 
might use foreigners as a kind of 
excuse, that is to claim that they 
had been interfering and pollut-
ing [students') minds." /twas for 
this reason that he and other out-
siders never actively joined the 
demonstrations or conversed wi th 
the students in public. 

During the nightly analyses 
with the students , the professor 
found them constantly compar-
ing this uprising to the American 
movcm.:nt In the '60s. He person-
ally felt the two wen: incompa-
rahle: "TIle wor~L thul was gmng

Sports 
UCSD Hangs Tough Despite Injuries 

Unbeaten Streak Stopped at 32 for Men's Soccer 
By PHIL GRUEN 
Sports Ediror 

It lasted over a year. 
It traveled up and down the 

California coast It even ventured 
to New York: and came out alive. 

But on Saturday, in the small 
Los Angeles suburb of Newhall, it 
died. 

Saturday's \-0 defeat at lhe 

hands of The Master's College, an 
NAJA school, marked lhe first time 
any team had beaten lhe UCSD 
men's soccer team in 32 consecu-
tive games - a streak which 
spanned a year and claimed a na-
tional championship along the way. 

But it seemed. at least for a 
while, that the 1989 version of the 
Tritons might be a learn of destiny. 
And, well, they still might be, but 
a minor miracle must occur if they 
are going to reign atop the Divi-
sion III soccer ranks a second 

, consecutive year. 
It's always tough to repeat -

especially when you lose a handful 
of players to graduation - but it 
certainly didn't help the Tritons 
any when key players Milce Bra-
dley and SCOll Goodman came 
down wilh injuries at the begin-
ning of lhe season. Although Bra-
dley returned to action yesterday 
against UC Irvine. Goodman will 
miss the remainder of the season. 

So what now? Well. aside from 
Rlmu Uqlrls,lGuanIian the loss 10 The Master's College. 

Scott Rommel leads the Tritons the Tritons are. for the most part. 
this year in scoring. still winning - thanks 10 a stingy 

young defense and a primarily 
veteran offense lhat scores goals 
when it counts. Last week the Tri-
tons picked up 2-0 victories over 
Soulhern Cal College and Azusa 
Pacific, and tied a tough UC Irvine 
squad yesterday on lhe road. 

Wednesday's 2-0 victory over 
Azusa Pacific was probably not 
much of an indication of what the 
offense is capable of doing - it 
failed to put the ball in the net 
during lhe entire first half despite 
numerous opportunities - but 
there was never much doubt as 10 
who was going 10 win this game. 

Even in the Tritons' frustrating 
first half, which ended in a score-
less tie, it was clear lhat it was just 
a matter of time before the team 
scored. And itdid take a little time, 
because UCSD did not score until 
nearly 10 minutes into lhe second 
half when senior Carrick Brewster 
used his head to score on a pass 
from sophomore Breu Egusa at 
64:04 .. 

But the Tritons, especially in 
the minute or two preceding their

Second-place finishes in two

PHll...'S ANALYSIS ... A national title is one thing, but 
I'm sorry. This is ridiculous. Just because the Poughkeep-
sie State Technical Institute of Agriculture & Mining (not 
the exact school, but you get the idea) wins the Division III 
national title in football in 1988, you're not going to find 
Notre Dame or Michigan on its 1989 schedule. You 
probably won't even find Oregon State on its schedule. 
Hey, we've got a damn good men's soccer team which 
won the Division III national title last season and hadn't 
lost a game in ages until Saturday, but - with all due 
respect to the Tritons - there won't be much joy in 
Mudville after Tuesday's contest. I'm not exactly sure 
how far UCLA went last year, but I do know that they went 
far enough, and that there is rarely a sport where we can 
compete on a similar level. I'm all for the Tritons - don't 
get me wrong - but this is kinda 1ike rooting for the 
Angels to catch the A's in the American League West. No 
chance. PHIL obviously advises that you ...

petition. 
Head Coach Doug Dannevik 

said going inlO the weekend tour-
nament that he would be "disap-
pointed if wedon't win it," but "we 
just want to see where we are 
against Division III C()lllpetition. " 

He found that the lhree-time 
defending national champion Tri-
tons are not the unbeatable force in 
Division III competition that they 
have been in recent years. In fact, 
UCSD lost more inter-division 
games in two days than they did in 
all of last season. 

In Friday's pool play. UCSD 
downed host Pomona-Pitzer 15-
12,IS-IO,andbreezedbyWhittier 
IS-4, IS-4. The Tritons appeared 
ready to sweep the pool, especially 
after grabbing the fltstgame against 
Incarnale Word of Texas, IS-8. 
But the match lOOk a nasty tum 
when Incarnate Word pulled out a 

16-14 second game and took the 
fmal match 15-8, seUing the Tri-
tons up as the fourth seed heading 
into the Saturday's quarterfinals. 

Things turned UCSD's way 
again on Saturday when the Tri-
tons opened with a IS-3. 15-4 
ousting of Claremont-Scripps. A 
semi-final victory over La Verne 
was a bit more strenuous for the 
Tritons, but they managed 10 get 
by the only Division 1II1eam that 
beal them last season, 15-13, 15-
10. 

Similar 10 their performance in 
pool play, the Tritons claimed their 
fltst game in lheir last match of the 
day against Menlo College, but 
couldn't hold things together. 
Menlo captured the tournament as 
it scrambled to a 4-1S, 15-10, 1:5-
II victory. UCSD's record fell to 
12-8. 

Senior All-American Diana 

Klintwalhandrtdshirtsophornore 
Elizabeth Tan, who tallied 40 and 
38 kills respectively in the six 
games, were named 10 the AlI-
Tournament team. 

The second-place finish at 
Pomona Pitzer was disappointing 
because the Tritons hid made 50 
much progress earlier in the week 
when they upset Division I USIU 
in the San Diego County Champi-
onships. 

In the first match of the County 
Championships, UCSD swept 
local challenger U.S. International 
16-14,I5-12,15-S. 

USIU jumpedouttoa 10-4 lead 
in the fltst game, as it frustrated the 
Tritons wilh a fast-paced, up-lempo 
offense. UCSD,however,C\imbed 
back behind lhe solid blocking of

1M Sports gears up for the boom days 
In the mid-1800s, the cry wu heard f. and ne.: "there's gold in them 

Ihar hilla, and plenty of Itl' WIth those historic words the crush was on. 
California has never been the same lince. Covered WIIQOO tralls eventually 
becaume clogged freeways. babbling brook prospectors begat high finance 
speculators, and three room schoolhouaes turned into massive university 
centers lor higher education. The "California Dream" was fufilled in rather 
short order and now we're moving into "overkill: 

But so what. This is UCSD now ... ready to attack the 1990s ... and its time 
10 acknowledge that the crush of humanity will be forever with us. This place 
is big and will only be getting much bigger. 

So, gel used to it... and above all...let·s have some funl I mean that's what 
we're all here for isn't it? C'mon, sure it isl 

This is where we come in. Intramural Sports. Don't forget those two 
important words. Irs the lifeblood of this placew. It's the only thing that will 
keep you sane. 

Yah, we know you're here to be as nuclear physicilt, but hey, you can't 
study 25 hours a day. It's nol possible. So why not try this deal out. Study 
lor 23 hours, and use that one last hour 10 play an 1M Sport. Or bewtter yet, 
shave 7 hours off your study day, and play every Intramural Sport that we 
have to offer this quarter. 

JUlt lI*1k. You can be Magic Johnson on Sunday night and Wayne 
Gr.tskyon Mondays. You can be Steffl Graf on Tuesday night and Karch 
Kiraly on Wednesdays. On Thursdays, you can make like Terry Schroeder 
in the pooI,and then on Sunday afternoons, you can be anybody you want... 
Randall Cunningham, Dan Marino, or Eric Dickerson. Ifaagreatlife at UCSO

To make" short and simple. FoIlowlhese easy steps and away you go. 
FORM-A-TEAM. FILL·OUT-A-TEAM-ROSTER (they're available at

M.SOCCER 
Continued from page 24 
firslScore, had been hovering about 
Azusa's goal wilhout convening 
any shots. First year midfielder 
Jarret Stevenson had the best cp-
'poounity on a perfectly centered 
pass from senior Mike Kappes, but 
his shot sailed high. 

It didn't really malter, because 
Azusa was never able to present 
the Tritons with much of an offen-
sive threaL Every so often, Azusa 
would bring llie ball down into 
UCSD territory and take a shot at 
the goal - with no luck. Goalie 
Brian Siljander, back from last 
year's injury which knocked him 
out of action for the postseason, 
had little trouble gathering up 
Azusa's attempts at scoring as he 
collected his fourth shutout of the 
year. 

Senior SCOII Rommel put the 
game away at 8:12 when his pen-
alty kick found the left side of the 
net following a late hit from Azusa 
Pacific goalie Juan Mares . Rom-
mel, who also scored in Monday's 
win over Southern Cal College, 
leads the Tritons in the scoring de-
partment with three goals. 

Head Coach Derek Annstrong, 
who has been doing wonders with 
the team considering the unex-
pected losses he has been com· 
pelled to endure, credited Wed-
nesday's win to the insertion of 
Kappes in the second half. Kap-
pes,though he did not score, helped 
the Tritons maintain ball control 
and put constant pressure on 
Azusa's goal. 

The Tritons, however, face 
probably the toughest competition 
they'll see all year in the upcoming 
week.

Continued from page 24 
12-11 lead as setter Linda Ross 
and Jennifer Wellman teamed up 
on two consecutive back-selS for 
kills. 

The Gulls benefitted from 
UCSD miscues, but USIU eventu-
ally caused ilS own demise as the 
Tritons' Becky Palmer served oul 
four consecutive poinlS and the 
game on an ace, 16-14. 

''The beginning of a match is 
like boxing ... you ha e to feel 
each other out. We 1m some ad-
justmenlS 10 make, L • of like a 
chess match." Dannevlk said. 

Klinlwonh sparked UCSD 10 
an early 6-2 lead in the second 
game, before the Gulls hit stride 10 
takea8-6edge. Themiodlepartof 
the game featured several long 
rallies, as usru maintained a two-
P.,Oint edge, 11-9. After a Triton 
timeout, Palmer paced a Triton 
comeback with five service poinlS. 
The game ended 15-12 when the 
Gulls let a Klintworth free ball 
land in the middle of the coun. 

In the second game, two com-
plete serving rowions resulted in a 
scant 5-4 USIU lead as numerous 
intense rallies led to SideoulS. The 
crowd of 150 backed the Tritons 
scrappy defense, as the team rode 
the serving of Dana Simone to a 9-
5 lead it would never relinquish. 

Dannevik explained that in that 
rotation set-up they "get so many 
more bells because Dana [Simone] 
is such a great defensive player. 

. and because we have three hitters 
in front." 

Ross and Tan collaborated on a 
double block to send the latter 10 
the service line. Tan shot down the 
Gulls with three aces in six tries. 
resulting in a 15-5 win. 

Ross, who spread out 31 ass isIS 
over the three games, earned an 
All-Tournament selection for her 
effons. Klintworth, as usual, was 
named to the team as well. 

"Our intensity in that match was 
higher than in any all year," Dan-
nevik claimed. 

"I felt we could win it, we just 
couldn't make very many mistakes. 
We had a few serv ice errors, but

They're Hot, They're Wild, 
They're On Sale. 

If you plan on writing, presenting, pub-
lishing, drawing or designing, MacWrite-U 
and MacDraw-U software from Claris is the 
hottest and wildest combination available for 
your Mac. 

MacWrite II is the hottest word processor 
around with footnotes or endnotes, a lightning-
fast lOO,OOO-word spelling checker, a 220,000-
synonym thesaurus, multiple columns, headers 
and footers. . 

It also has word counting so you don't go 
one word over on that 1,0000word paper that's 
due first thing in the morning. And for those 
foreign language studies, optional international 
spelling dictionaries make your assignments 
a little less foreign . 

Now let's talk wild. MacDraw II is outra-
geous. You can use it with virtually any 
course you're taking. Make overhead slides 
for a class presentation, or create structural 

drawings or architectural designs for those 
engineering or interior design classes- even 
newsletters and flyers for student-body 
sponsored events. 

It's easy but precise. Zoom in to 3200%, 
rotate objects in .10 increments, measure 
down to millimeters, even "do dimensioning." 

Put hot and wild together and things 
get really exciting. You can insert your 
MacDraw II drawings into MacWrite n. 
And even reduce, enlarge and crop them 
once they're there. 

Your campus has worked out a special 
deal for you. It won't last forever. Get hot. 
Get wild. Get 
MacWrite II and ;i 
MacDraw 11 now. ?ziG

"If we can improve on this game 
we' ll be good sooner than I 
thoughL" 

The Tritons' progress soon 
came to an alanning halt, as they 
couldn't get anything started 
against San Diego State in the 
championship game a few hours 
later. The Aztecs, 9-5 and ranked 
19th in Division I, swept the Tri-
tons in overwhelming fashion 15-
1, 15-8, 15-II,even through Dan-
nevik felt going in that his team 
could steal a couple of games. 

"When we did things right, they 
just stuffed us. That' s frusttating. 
I was disappointed that wecouldn 't 
do more," he said, summing up the 
match.
