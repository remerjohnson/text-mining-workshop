A.S. External Hosts 
'Excellence in Diversity' 
ISSUES: Statewide conference 
features workshops and 
lectures on affirmative action 
By Mary Hleglns 
Staff Writer 

The A.S. External Affairs office hosted an 
affirmative-action conference Saturday in the 
Price Center Ballroom, as part of a statewide 
campaign to defend affirmative-aetion programs 
in both schools and the workplace. 

Seventy-five representatives of the Califor-

nia Students' Rights Coalition (CSRC)-a UC-
wide activist group - attended the conference, 
entitled "Excellence in Diversity." 

As with the Oct. 17 "Politics of Division" 
teach-in at the Price Center, a majority of the 
crowd was in favor of affirmative action - and 
against the UC regents's decision to appeal it 
over the summer. 

According to A.S. Vice President of Exter-
nal Affairs Brian Dowd, the goal of the confer-
ence was to increase communication about af-
firmative action between the UC campuses.

UCSD Rape 
Victim 
Discloses 
New Details 
INFORMAnON: Woman says 
she is unable to positively 
identify her attacker 
By Anand Patel 
Staff Writer 

The 19-year-old woman who reported 
being raped in a Marshall College parking 
lot early last month met with UCSD Police 
Detective Bob Jones on Thursday to clarify 
the details of the incident. 

The woman, who still wishes to remain 
anonymous, told Jones that she parked on 
the eastern edge of lot 305 (North Parking) 
at approximately 10:15 p.m. on Oct. 1. 

As she was exiting her vehicle, she said 
an unknown male approached from behind 
and grabbed her. 

According to the woman, the attacker 
placed his hand over her mouth and said he 
would hurt her if she screamed. 

The victim also said the attacker pushed 
her to the ground between two vehicles and 
proceeded to rape her. Another car pulled 
into the lot shortly thereafter, causing the 
alleged rapist to flee. 

The woman told Jones that her assailant 
was wearing dark clothing and a dark ski 
mask. She said he was approximately 6 feet, 
weighed 200 pounds and was in his mid-to-
late 20s. The victim was unsure of her 
attacker's race. 

Although Jones said the woman's unwill-
ingness to file an official police report pre-
vents the police department from actively 
investigating the rape, he said the police are 
currently, "on the lookout for [the attacker], 
because now we have somewhat of a de-
scription of him." 

"But the fact of the matter is that she is 
not reporting it, so she is not going to pursue 
it criminally," Jones added. "We have to 
res pect t hat. " 

The rape victim told Jones she sought 
medical assistance, but that she did not suf-
fer any bruises, cuts or broken bones. 

"Physically she was not harmed, but I do 
not think she will be psychologically well 
for a long time," Jones said. 

The woman is now dealing with the post-
traumatic aspects of the attack, Jones added.

FINANCIAL AID:

By Esther Yoon 
Staff Writer 

The UC Board of Regents will 
consider at its upcoming November 
meeting a new definition of higher 
education "affordability" and a pos-
sible $200 increase in 1996-97 fees 
as part of the redrafted" Affordability

The new guidelines, proposed by 

the AfIordability Model Review Com-

Talking Through Your Troubles 
GROUPS:UCSD 
Psych Services caters 
to individual needs 
By Matthew Kalinowski 
Guardian Reporter 

As the quarter draws to an end, 
many students may feel over-
whelmed by tedious academics and 
the pressures of daily life. UCSD 
Psychological & Counseling Ser-
vices (P&CS) stands ready to as-
sist students who need help cop-
ing. 

P&CSoffersindividualappoint-
ments with psychologists. as well 
as more than 20 peer, therapy and 
support groups. 

One such group is the Alcohol 
and Substance Abuse GrouP. what 
UCSD psychologist Dan Munoz 
- the group leader-calls a drop-
in support group "for people who 
wonder whether alcohol and sub-
stance abuse impedes their life." 

"The support groups discuss 
coping skills in the here and now, 
whereas therapy groups also look 
at the history of the situation -
how things got this way." group 
coordinator Miriam losupovici 
said. 

In general, support groups are 
more informal than therapy groups. 

" It 's a lighter type of group-
you don 't have to have a problem 
10 come here," said John Wu,leader 
of the Asian-American Forum 
group. 

Wu added Ihat many people just 
come to discuss their concerns with 
others like themselves. 

The support 
groups, which average 
from six to eight 
people. cover every-
thing from social skills 
to dealing with be-
reavement. There are 
al so less-spec i fic 
groups, which include 
the Undergraduate 
Growth Group - a 
general support group. 

" VVe have one of 
the most complete 
group therapy Ireat-
ment programs in the 
stale," losupovici said. 

Group meetings 
are often used in con-
junction with indi-
vidual appointments 
with a psychologist.

The group setting 
has several advantages 
over a one-on-one,

proach. Munoz said. 
Groups can provide a

more realistic environment, where 
unique situations are created 
through the interaction of the 
group's members. 

The group setting is helpful be-
cause "people can identify with 
others like themselves," Munoz 
added. "Sometimes, things are 
more effectively communicated 
through peers than through author-
ity figures." 

" [Groups] offer the opportunity 
to move back and forth between 
finding help and offering insight 
and support to others," a P&CS 

brochure states. 
Therapy and support groups are 

led by a professional psychologist 
or a P&CS intern. The leader's job 
is to provide an atmosphere which 
allows everyone in the group to 
participate . 

"The psychologist provides 
tools for the group to use." said to 
intern Linda Young, one of the 
leaders of the Alcohol and Sub-
stance Abuse Group. 

Although no therapy or support 
groups would exist without group

This is patently false for 
two clear and important 
reasons: The military is a 
special institution in which 
civilian laws and mores do 
not apply, and homosexu-
ality, by its nature, under-
mines the morale and ef-
fectiveness of the armed 
forces. 

The armed ser-
vices, unlike civilian 

institutions, have a special purpose: to protect 
and insure the collective security and interests 
of the nation. And, to fulfill these duties, the mili-
tary is set up as a hierarchical and collective institu-
tion, wherein the compelling interest of national se-
curity far outweighs the interests of individual ser-
vicemen - the exact opposite of civilian society and 
its institutions. 

Accordingly, given the unique imperative and the 
singular importance of the armed forces, military ser-
vice is apportioned as a privilege, not a right. 

Consequently, because the military as a whole 
takes just precedence over individual interests in the 
context of national security, the armed forces assert 
the proper right to discriminate against those who 
cannot adequately perform the duties of a service-
man.

6 OPINION 

UNITY: Morale 
weakened when gays 
serve in the military 
Continued from PIll. 4 

As a result, the military 
currently discriminates against 
a wide range of people without 
any debate or controversy what-
soever - including the blind, the 
deaf, the lame, those missing 
limbs, the diseased and the men-
tally ill . The military also has 
strict height, weight and other 
health requirements which ex-
clude those who are unfit for ser-
vice in the armed forces. 

Furthermore, the military also 
bars those whose behavior is dis-
ruptive, counterproductive, insub-
ordinate or in any way under-
mines the unity vital to the capa-
bility and effectiveness of the 
armed forces. And such behavior 
includes homosexuality. 

The public at large readily un-
derstands the exclusion of those 
who are physically or psychologi-
cally unfit for service, but they of-
ten have difficulty understanding 
how homosexuals weaken morale 
and disrupt unity. This is because 

the public is unfamiliar with the 
distinct nature of military life and 
culture, which differs greatly from 
civilian life. 

One of the most important as-
pects of military life, and prob-
ably the fundamental difference in 
comparison to civilian life, is the 
intimacy and complete lack of pri-
vacy in the day-to-day operation 
within a platoon. 

Military personnel live, work, 
eat, sleep, play and fight together. 
All individualism is subordinated 
to a common leadership and a 
common interest. In this disci-
plined, austere, almost monastic 
ambience, soldiers form strong 
bonds because their very lives de-
pend on each other, especially in 
a combat situation. 

As my cousin, who is in the 
navy, said, " If a homosexual is 
present in a platoon, he or she im-
mediately causes tension, distrust 
and suspicion throughout. Any ro-
mantic or sexual interests within a 
platoon, even if unconsummated, 
would shattcr the essential bonds 
that add up to unit cohesion and 
read i ness. " 

This problem is the same rea-
son that men and women do not

live together in the same platoon. 
Sexual interest is natural and in-
evitable and, even if not acted 
upon, would consequently under-
mine morale, effectiveness and 

unity. 
To expect a homosexual to live 

in a platoon with members of the 
same gender and never have even a 
passing sexual interest or thought 
is absurd and unrealistic. This 
would be akin to a pUlling a service-
man in a female platoon and expect-
ing him never to be aroused or dis- . 
tracted every day when he takes a 
shower with the servicewomen. 

Indeed, my cousin said that, "no 
platoon could ever be completely 
effective and unified if they thought 
that every day, when they take their 
showers, one of their members 
might be ogling over them." 

It would be equally foolish to 
suggest that special quarters be 
administered for homQsexuals, 
since this contradicts the unity 
and conformity essential to an ef-
ficient military. Furthermore, it 
would inject an insidious form of 
disunity and individualism into 
the armed forces. 

Nevertheless, proponents of 
allowing homosexuals into the 
military frequently refer to the 
past struggle of minorities, espe-
cially blacks, to defeat discrimi-
nation in military service as a 
feeble and emotional appeal to

gain support for their cause. 
However, when examined logi-

cally, one can see that this is a fal-
lacious and weak analogy. Being 
a minority and being a homo-
sexual are two things that are not 
even remotely comparable. 

Being a minority in no way hin-
ders a serviceman's ability to per-
form his duties, and it does not 
undermine the unity of the armed 
forces, in spite of irrational past 
prejudices which have been over-
come. However, the intrinsic state 
of being homosexual does under-
mine the inorale, unity and effec-
tiveness vital to a functional mili-
tary. 

White and minority service-
men alike recognize the damag-
ing effect homosexuality has on 
the trust, readiness and solidarity 
of a platoon, and both know that 
homosexuals do not belong in the 
armed forces. 

In addition, the military and its 
leaders are not homophobic be-
cause they do not fear homosexu-
als. They simply reject the de-
structive influence homosexuality 
has on the unity necessary to 
maintain integrity in our national 
security.

REFORM: Bias 
damages military 
efficiency the most 
ContinUed from pal. 4 
with allowing gays into the mili-
tary. Because Clinton promised 
the American public that he would 
initiate this'cliange, it makes sense 
to be first on the list of military 
reforms. 

In reality, there should be no 
issue concerning gays in the mili-
tary. Currently, the armed forces 
practice open discrimination, 
which is simply wrong. Most 
people in the United States have 
moved beyond the childish stage 
of fearing homosexuality, and 
have come to recognize that indi-
viduals have a basic right to 
choose their own sex partners. 
Sadly, the military has not yet 
reached this level of mature think-
ing. As a weak compromise, the 
current policy - "Don't ask, 
don't tell" - does nothing but 
restate the initial exclusionary 
law. "If we don't know you're 
gay, we won't punish you." By the 
same token, a rapist won ' t be pun-
ished if nobody knows he did it. 

In the process, the military is 
turning away fully qualified sol-
diers. It seems odd for an institu-
tion to reject potential troops 
while claiming to be developing 
the finest, most efficient unit pos-
sible. If that were the case, they 
would recognize that one's sexual 
preference docs not hamper his 
ability. to fire a gun or fly a jet 

fighter. 
Still, opponents argue that it is 

precisely because of the need to 
create the most efficient forces 
possible that gays must not join. 
They contend that homosexuals 
will compromise the military's ef-
ficiency, primarily by disrupting 
the "morale" of the soldiers. But 
these lines are nothing more than 
the latest excuses for keeping out 
homosexuals. They are conve-
nient defenses for people with an 
irrational fear of gays. The truth 
is these people are revolted by ho-
mosexuality and are uncomfort-
able in its presence. 

This belief stems from another 
outdated stereotype of homosexu-
als as promiscuous, lascivious sex 
fiends who will be unable to con-
trol themselves while on duty -
as if any gay soldier will immedi-
ately accost the first attractive 
marine he sees. While hetero-
sexual men and women already 
serve together and manage to limit 
the amount of uncontrollable in-
tercourse, opponents point out 
that the real problems develop 
within the quarters: in the show-
ers and in crowded bunks. Butthis 
is equally I udicrous. After all, 
gays have been in the military for 
'quite some time - without being 
allowed to tell anyone - and have 
managed to restrain thcmselves so 
far. 

Occasionally, opponents ac-
cept that the gays themselves are 
not the problem - that is, they 
acknowledge that gays would not 
necessarily give in to sexual im-

pulse. And they are right - this 
would not be a problem. These are 
highly disciplined adults who 
would understand the rules very 
clearly. And should a problem 
arise, they would be immediately 
dismissed. 

Still, others say that the pri-
. mary concern is over the attitudes 
of the rest of the troops. They ar-
gue that heterosexual soldiers 

would not feel comfortable living 
and working in such close proxim-
ity to gays. And this, they contend, 
would compromise the military 's ef-
ficiency because it would hinder the 
concentration of the troops, result-
ing in antagonism between a gay 
soldier and one who hates gays. 

This argument does not justify 
exclusion of gays for two reasons. 
First, we must remember that the 
military trains its soldiers to be 
highly disciplined, all the while 
claiming that it uses only the most 
qualified people. If this were actu-
ally the case, then we wouldn't have 
to worry about the heterosexual sol-
diers feeling uncomfortable and not 
being able to work witb gays. Any-
one who gives in to irrational preju-
dice and is incapable of working or 
showering next to a gay soldier -
in an unjustified fear that the gay 
soldier may sexually accost him -
does no! belong in the military. In 
its quest to find the best soldiers 
America has to offer, surely the 
military would weed out the irratio-
nal recruits. 

Secondly, if, in fact , any soldiers 
or opponents of gays in the military 
feel that such a fear is not irratio-
nal, then it becomes simple preju-
dice. Quite simply, America cannot 
allow its armed forces to cater to the 
latest infantile prejudice of ignorant 
soldiers. If the bias of the decade 
happens to be toward people of Ira-
nian descent, would the military 
prevent their entry? After all, you 
never know where their true loyal-
ties may lie - an Iranian soldier just 
might "sabotage" his fellow troops 

OPINION 7 

at any time. Just because some 
soldiers or politicians would be 
uncomfortable serving with 
gays does not mean that the en-
tire country should fall victim 
to such absurdity. 

The military used the same 
intolerance against blacks and 
women earlier in the century. 
People argued that blacks were 
inferior and that whites would 
not feel comfortable serving 
alongside them. Once the mili-
tary was integrated, however, 
this silly belief dissipated. 

Yet, we still see the same ar-
gument used against gays to-
day: Heterosexuals will not feel 
comfortable serving alongside 
gays, and thus the gays must be 
kept out. But once those sol-
diers see that they can work 
with gays and fUJI be sexually 
assaulted or pressured, the bias 
will fade. Just as they came to 
see that blacks could operate 
complex satellites systems, they 
will see tbat gays are capable of 
sexually restraining themselves 
in the interest of their military 
and their country. What remains 
to be seen is whetber anti-gay 
soldiers can put aside or over-
come tbeir bigotry in the inter-
est of their country. 

Allowing gays entry into the 
U.S. armed forces would sim-
ply be the first step toward im-
proving our military institution, 
as well as its image. Until we 
take this step, however, it will 
remai n a bastion of bias and ir-
rational hatred.

Hacking: UCLA student Michelle Gusora takes advantage of a lull 
in the conference to type up her notes for the day. 

FORUM: Myth 
of federal racial 
quotas debunked 
Continued from page 1 

Dowd said he felt the conference 
was effective, but he would have 
liked more participation from UCSD 
students. 

The eight-hour program was di-
vided into two sessions, both com-
prised of workshops and general 
meetings. The day 's first session 

focused on uniting and confirm-
ing a defense of affirmative ac-
tion. 

Small groups discussed the poli-
tics of division · within 
underrepresented communities, re-
cruitment and retention of students 
from these communities, the forma-
tionofcoalitionsand the future strat-
egies of the CSRC. 

The second session dealt mainly 
with the California Civil Rights Ini-
tiative (CCRI), a ballot proposal 
which seeks to end the use of "race, 

The UCSD Guardian 

sex, color, ethnicity or national ori-
gin" as factors in public employ-
ment, education and contracting. 

Winkfield Twyman, an associ-
ate professor at the California West-
ern School of Law, called CCRI an 
"assault on affirmative action" 
driven by misinformation. 

Twyman further accused CCRI 
advocates of needlessly fearing the 
use of quotas in determining col-
lege admissions and government 
hiring. . 

"There is no such thing as a 
federally imposed quota [regarding 
affirmative action]," he said. 

Quotas, according to a flyer sup-
plied at the conference, arc the 
"court-imposed remedies which 
enforce an order against a particular 
defendant who has practiced 'egre-
gious discrimination against specifi-
cally identified individuals." 

"It is a myth that white males are 
denied academic and professional 
positions because of quotas estab-
lished by the government," Dowd 
said. 

"Quotas are illegal," Dowd 
added. "The only time they exist is 
when an employer has been proven 
to be discriminatory. Then, the judi-
cial system may impose a quota." 

CCRI supporters tlaim that af-

firmative action destroys the merit 
system. 

According to UCSD administra-
tors, 60 percent of the students in the 
UC system were admitted solely on 
the basis of their academic index 
scores - the combination of SAT 
and SAT-II scores, GP A and honors 
courses. 

The remaining 30 to 40 percent 
of students accepted to the univer-
sity are admitted on the basis of 
supplemental criteria - which in-
cludes being from a racially 
underrepresented group, having 
some form of disability and making 
a commitment to community ser-
vice. 

Ten percent of the UC-accepted 
students are those applicants who 
are UC-eligible, underrepresented 
and/or economically disadvan-
taged. These students are admit-
ted based on their predicted first-
year GPA. 

The UC regents voted on July 20 
to end the use of race, religion, sex, 
color, ethnicity or national origin as 
admission criteria. The policy will 
be effective Jan. 1,1997. 

The regents also prohibited the 
use of the same criteria with regards 
to employment and contracti ng prac-

Monday, November 6,1995 

Supporters of CCRI and the UC 
regents' decision argue that current 
affirmative-action policies are 
merely reverse discrimination, and 
that they harm the very communi-
ties they seek to help. 

"Race shouldn't be an issue," 
Dowd replied. "But because it has 
been an issue and still is an issue, it 
must be taken into account. Race is 
in everything that we do, so how can 
we create a system where race isn't 
considered?" 

Heidi Muzhik/Guardian

Gomez attacks current regental 
policies before the crowd.

ContInued from pace 3 
leaders, recent budget cuts have 
forced P&CS to trim its staff -
which is partially funded by stu-
dent fees. 

Because of the lack of re-
sources, some of those seen on an 
individual basis are limited to a 
certain number of sessions with a 
therapist 

"If we didn't have time limits, 
we wouldn't be able to take care of 
the needs of others," losupovici 
~d. 

However, these limited therapy 
sessions can also cause problems. 

"There is a short-term gain, but 
some people aren't receiving the 
full treatment they need," P&CS 
Director John Gibenk said. 

The "band-aid" treatment just 
creates more emergencies, he 
added. 

"We can't be as immediately 
responsive as before- that's why 
we have more groups," Gibenk 
said. "Our forte is our staff."

RAPE: Police 
say many rapes go 
unreported 
Continued frcm paCe 1. 
He said he encouraged her to 
meet with Nancy Wahlig, di-
rector of the Student Safety 
Awareness Program, for profes-
sional counseling. 

Wahlig said she is not sure 
why the woman chose not to 
make an official police report. 

She added that there are many 
reasons why a woman would 
not report a rape, including not 
knowing how the police would 
respond or whether the media 
would protect her identity . 

"But [filing a report] is not 
the only way that somebody can 
recover and speak out about 
what happened tothem,"Wahlig 
said. 

Many women do not involve 
the police and instead seek help' 
from their friends and family, 
Wahlig added . 

She said she believes the 
woman in this incident showed 
a great deal of energy and cour-
age in approaching the police. 

SENSES: 
Machines may soon 
mimic human 
behavior 
Continued from page 2 
amounts of the nectar. 

"The key to this system turns 
out to be an internal teacher, in 
this case the octopamine system 
in the bee, that can predict ahead 
of time whelher or not a particu-
lar scnsory stimulus or decision 
you have to make is a good one," 
Sejnowski said. 

"Psychologists have said 
these are the kinds of experi-
menls that indicate that bees are 
avoiding risk; and when given 
the choice, they will go toward 
the safe supply," Sejnowski 
added. 

Researchers said the new re-
search has the potential to help 
other scientists, who are inter-
ested in artificial intelligence, 
overcome hurdles in their at-
tempts to build machines which 
mimic human intelligence and 
decision-making. 

Until now, computers have 
been able to solve complex prob-
lems using logic, but have been 
unable to make judgment deci-
sions.

"A large percentage of the 
actual rapes go unreported." 
Jones said, adding that for ev-
ery reported rape, he believes 
there could be as many as 20 
that go unreported. 

The UCSD police keep 
records of reported sexual as-
saults, as well as attempted and 
confirmed rapes . 

There has been one confirmed 
sexual assault and one confirmed 
rape every year since 1992. 

The Oct. 1 incident was the 
first rape reported this fall. An-
other woman reported that she 
was the victim of al\ attempted 
rape on Oct. 18 al the southern 
intersection of Gilman Dr. and 
Villa La Jolla Dr. 

Wahligsaidshe hopes people 
will attend the evening rape edu-
cation and prevention work-
shops she will be holding for 
the next few weeks. 

She encourages rape victims 
to contact her at 534-5793, or 
the Center for Women Studies 
and Services' Rape Crisis 
Hotline at 233-3088. 

Anyone wilh information . 
about the crime is urged to call 
Sergeant Jones at 534-4359.

COST: Model 
will set manageable 
student workload 
ContInued from ..... 1. 
discussion and has not been submit-
ted with the other guidelines." 

The review committee's report 
stated that parents should be ex-
pected to contribute "a reasonable 
amount" to their child's education 
"based on their ability to pay as 

, determin~d by federal need-analy-
sis methodology, but thai students 
themselves 'should be expected to 
contribute through loans and work. " 

Loan/work expectations in the 
Affordability Model are based on the 
concept of manageability ,"in the sense 
that they should neither preclude nor 
significantly reduce student access, 
academic performance or graduation 
from the university." 

"The [redrafted] Affordability 
Model sets a range of work and 
payback that is manageable for stu-
dents." Watson said. 

The new Affordability Model 
specifies expectations for work dur-
ing the school year and summer. A 
range of work hours is assumed -
due to students' variable schedules

-although the committcecautioned 
that the hours should range between 
10 and 20 per week during the aca-
demic year, "in order to have little 
or no adverse impacton eilhergrades 
or units attempted." 

The committee recommended 
that the university keep average work 
requirements below 15 hours per 
week and loan repayments under 
seven percentofthe first post-gradu-
ation-year salary. 

The Affordability Model will 
effectively "minimize the use of 
work/loan expectations as a part of 
packaging financial aid," said A.S. 
Vice President of Finance Edmondo 
Robinson, a student representative 
on the review commiltee. 

"This plan will shrink the range of 
work that students perform toward 
loan payback, and it offers students 
many options time-wise," he added. 

However, Watson believes the ' 
commiltee's plan cannot be entirely 
effective unlil it receives approxi-
mately $30 million in funding. 

"[The] UC's are funded at [the 
higher end] ofthe work expectation 
range, which forces some students 
to work throughout the year and 
keeps them from participating in 
academic activities - or may inter-

NEWS 11 

fere with their cl8llcs during the 
school year," Watson said. 

"If $30 million is taken from a 
$200 fee increase per student and 
applied towards grant funding. stu-
dents can take fuller advantage of 
the academic opportunities provided 
by the university," he added. 

The funds allocated from in-
creased undergraduate tuition fees 
would provide for an increase of 
approximately $).000 in university 
grants per financially needy student. 

"The Affordability Model repre-
sents a commitment of the univer-
sity to keep the school affordable 
for financially needy students," 
Watson said . . 

- The proposed $200 fee increase 
for 1996-97 will be considered by 
the UC regents at their Nov. 16 
meeting, along with a proposal sub-
mitted by Dc President Richard 
Atkinson for a 7.1 percent increase 
in fees for next year. 

However, Robinson said the pos-
sibility of UC students paying for 
both fee increases next year is "un-
likely." 

"The $200 fee increase may be 
included inthe 7.1 percent proposal," 
he said. "I really don't see it happen-

12 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Monday, November 6, 1995 

CROSS-CULTURAL CEN'IER REBUKES CRITICISM 
Editor: 

In his confusing commentary 
(" Racism Not the Main Problem," 
Oct. 30, 1995), Derek van Hoften 
makes a number of erroneous and 
misleading statements regarding 
the UCSD Cross-Cultural Center 
(CCC). He complains that the 
CCC has failed "to improve race 
relations or diversity at UCSD. 
Instead , it has sat in relative ob-
scurity in an abandoned corner of 
campus. " 

The dean of humanities and the 
Departments of Engineering, Vi-
sual Arts and Literature would be 
shocked to learn that they inhabit 
an abandoned corner of the cam-
pus. 

The supporters of the CCC never 
intended it as a cure for the lamen-
table state of race relations on this 

. campus or as a solution to the prob-
lem offair representation for all eth-
nic groups. The CCC, which has 
existed only since last spring, was 
conceived as one ingredient in a 
complex remedy for curing 
UCSD's ills. 

Since its opening, the CCC has 
hosted a wide variety of events and 
has attracted students, staff and fac~ 
ulty from the entire campus com-
munity. The enthusiaStic response 
from all those who believe in find-
ing common ground, rather than 
exacerbating divisions, suggests 
that the CCC is already much more 
than "imagery," as van Hoften ar-
gues. Furthermore, van Hoflen 's as-
sertion that "unqualified minori-
ties" are being admitted to UCSD 
without academic credentials is pa-
tently false. 

We suggest he visit the CCC so 
that he might meet students of color 
and other people of goodwill who 
are ready and ab le to strip him of 
his prejudices and misconceptions.

Euthanasia Is a Form 
Of Mercy, Not Murder 
Editor: 

I came across an issue of the 
Guardian in a doughnut shop th is 
morning, and I have a few com-
ments on Bill Glanzmann 's article 
("Doctors and Society Have Obli-
gation to Persevere and to Search 
for Cures," Oct. 23, 1995). 

• Rights are not given, but as-
sumed. Those which are given are 
privileges -the Declaration of In-
dependence, for instance. 

• There can be no "involuntary 
euthenasia." Glanzmann confuses 
mercy with murder. 

• Killing to relieve great suffer· 
ing when there is no hope is mercy, 
not murder - provided that the sub· 
ject wishes to be killed. 

It is not arrogant to realistically 
conclude that there is no hope. It is 
arrogant to keep a tortured being 
alive in spite of his wishes. Have 
you ever seen a person with his jaws 
and ears eaten away by cancer and 
in unmitigated pain around the 
clock? 

Have you ever seen a person 
with both arms and legs paralyzed 
due to an incurable spinal fracture, 
one who must be tended to like a 
baby for the rest of his life and fre-
quently pumped full of morphine for 
never-ending pain? Where is the ar-
rogance? 

One's life does not properly be-
long to an autocratic, therapeutic 
state, nor is it in good taste for 
anyone to tell somebody else who 
suffers from excruciating, hope-
less agony that it must continue. 
People in this state cannot wait for 
an impossible, or even a possible 
cure.

Bosnia, ~ Oct. 30. 1995) reminded 
me of a fact which seemed elusive 
throughout the text. I believe former 
acting Secretary of State Lawrence 
Eaglcburger put it most clearly, stat-
ing, "True friends of the peoples of 
Yugoslavia must acknowledge that 
history did not begin there yester-
day, and that the tragedy now un-
folding has ancient and complicated. 
roots. " 

Hostility between the Slav 
peoples of southeastern Europe is 
nothing new. In fact, it might even 
be the rule. Bulgarians fought 
Serbs in the Middle Ages, Serbs 
fought each other, and Croats -
under Hungarian innuence -
fought Serbs. 

Turkish domination of the 
Balkans in the 14th and t 5th cen-
turies may have given the Slav 
peoples a common enemy - but 
ev.en here, religion created a new 
fault line. During the Turkish oc-
cupation, many Serbs and Croats 
in Bosnia and Herzegovi na con-
verted to Islam. This created a 
Muslim-C hristian sp lit alongside 
the one which already existed be-
tween Orthodox Serbs and Catho-

lic Croats. 
This split has persisted into mod-

ern times. Repression undercommu-
nist rule in 20th-century Yugoslavia 
abated the pursuance of each group's 
nationalistic goals. The fall of com-
munism and the disillusion of the 
Yugoslav state simply initiated the 
inevitable. Each group sought sover-
eignty, leading to yet another war. 

To insist that foreign interven-
tion in this ancient dispute will spell 
a cure is ridiculous. Are we to con-
vince them with weapons which 
they should capitulate to reason, and 
live among themselves in peace? 
And who are we to dictate to them 
the destiny of their nations and cul-
tures? 

I agree with Mr. Fitzgibbons' 
statement, "sending no more than a 
few thousand to this area would dras-
tically limit the number of severe ca-
sualties." This is true, because we 
would only have a few thousand dead 
American bodies to pick up. 

If you are going to fight a war, 
go prepared. I recall the old saying, 
"Pray for the best, prepare for the 
worst." What good is the "inherent 
strength of our military" without the 
troops to exercise it? 

Mr. Fitzgibbons also states that 
"the peace-keepers .. . would serve 
mainly as a deterrent to increased 
violence in the area." Are we to 
believe that war-hardened 
Serbians are going to be afraid of 
unwelcome American soldiers 
simply because they arc Ameri-
cans? We cannot send in troops 
with the expectation that they are 
not going to fight. 

And these groups will fight it out. 
It's been a long time coming, and 
any imposed peace would only be 
temporary. Congress allocated $50 
million in military aid for the 
Bosnian Muslims years ago, but it 
has been locked up because of the 
U.N.-sponsored arms embargo. It is 
time to lift the embargo or break it, 
evening the odds and letting the in-
evi table happen.

Ballroom Dane. Club 
Apologizes to UCSD 
Editor: 

As the Ballroom Dance Club ad-
visor, I feel obligated to a~logize to 
everyone who attends our dances. 

A man at the Halloween Dance 
was overly friendly with his dance 
partners. He would reportedly stroke 
his partner's back. offer her massages 
and refuse to let her change partners. 
I first learned of this from two women 
who literally ran out of the ballroom 
to escape him. When I heard what he 
had done and had him pointed out to 
me, I went to talk to ~im, waming him 
that I would be watching him for the 
rest of the night. 

A few songs later, I saw him ap-
proach a woman and adamantly in-
sist that she dance with him, and 
once again he was dancing closer 
than he ought to. I demanded that 
he leave immediately. I followed 
him outside to make sure he left. 

This episode makes me furious. It 
has always been the goal of the club 
to provide a safe and friendly atmo-
sphere in which everyone can dance. 
Every so often, we get reports of danc-
ers who cannot tell the difference be-
tween social dancing and lovemaking, 
and we deal with these as they occur. 
However, to my knowledge, that 
night's occurence was the worst yet. 

I vow to the ballroom dance com-
munity of this campus that I will be 
more observant. I am ashamed that 
this man harassed so many women, 
and I will not tolerate anyone coming 
to our dances and making anyone else 
feel uncomfortable. 

I ask that people inform any of the 
club offICers whenever anything like 
this happens. We will take whatever 
steps are necessary to make every 
dance a place where everyone can 
have a good time. Please do not hesi-
tate to tell us how you feel about what 
we' re doing and please do not judge 
every dance sponsored by the Ball-
room Dance Club by the actions of a 
few miscreants.

The resultant two.pointer was 
the final nail in UCSD's coffin. 
Trailing \0-4, what little wind 
was .Ieft quickly escaped the 
Triton's sails. 

"From that point on, we just 
sort of drowned," Harper said. 

The 1 5-5 final score was tough 
to swallow, but for UCSD, it 
wasn't a result worth dwelling 
ovec. 

The Tritons are looking to-
ward the Western Water Polo 
Association (WWPA) champi-
onships, which will be held on

across the line in a very fast 
1 :42.86 to grab the number-one 
spot by over a second faster than 
their nearest Torero competitors. 

Junior Heather McPherson 
was among the other Triton no-
tables, finishing second in the 
1000 freestyle and fourth in the 
500 freestyle. 

Kristin Kemmer and Kristi 
Jordan each had solid showings 
for the UCSD team in the 100 
and 200 backstroke events, as 
both posted respectable times in 
the season's inagural meet. 

"This was a pretty good early-
season meet for us," Boyd said. 
"USD is a Division I school, so 
we didn't expect to win. 

"The girl's are preparing for

After their solid home perfor-
mances against the teams from 
Los Angeles, the Tritons feel 
confident in their abil ity to win 
at Canyonview. 

"If we weren't at home [for 
the WWPAs), I'd be concerned 
at this point,· Harper said. "But 
we play so much better at home." 

In addition to the home pool 
advantage, the UCSD squad has 
another leg up on the toughest 
competition in their conference: 
Recent history. 

The Tritons beat both Air 
Force and UC Davis en route to 
the Mount Baldy Tournament 
title two weeks ago, establishing 
themselves as the team to beat in 
the WWPA.

Boyd added . 

In action taking place above 
the pool's surface, the UCSD div-
ingteam helped to close the point 
gap late in the meet with an aerial 
display that earned 31 of the 38 
points available. Sheri Takeuchi 
and Kristi Young did the honors 
for the Tritons, finishing one and 
two respectively in the one-meter 
board . Takeuchi completed her 
set with a total score of 255.9, 
and Young hit the pool on her 
last dive a mere 10 points back 
(245.75). 

The two teammates the.n 
swapped positions, with Young 
taking top honors (249.75) in the 
three-meter board and Takeuchi 
finishing in second place 
(240.275). 

UCSD's next event will be a 
men's and women's meet against 
the North Coast Aquatics club on 
Sat., Nov. 11. The action will 
began at 11 a.m . in the

box. The ball wriggled free and 
Barland toe·nicked the loose ball 
to Cordes, who then deposited it 
into the net for the lead. 

"I told our players not to panic," 
McManus said. "I kept telling our 
players to just be patient, and we'll 
win it." 

The Tritons followed their 
coach's wisdom 59 seconds later, 
when junior forward Ele Johnson 
notched the tying score at the 
112:27 mark. 

Sophomore midfielder Lauren 
Johnson dished the ball to Ele in-
side the box; and after drawing the 
'keeper out of her goal, Ele slid 
the ball into the back of the net, 
knotting the contest at one score 
apiece. 

UCSD did not waste any time 
celebrating, as it scoring the go-
ahead goal only three minutes later 
on a tally by senior forward Carin 
Pugh. 

At the 115:15 mark, Ele 
Johnson split two defenders on the 

. right side of the field and crossed 
a perfect pass to a streaking Pugh, 
who then took off on the 
breakaway. 

Following Ele's lead, Pugh 
drew the Gusties' goaltender out 
of her box and deftly slipped the 
ball past herforthe game-winning 
.goal: . 

'" just kept telling [Pugh] to 
keep it going, and it'll come .. to

and [Pugh] kept pushing, and they 
finally got a break. The players 
were simply magical; I could not 
have asked them to play any bet· 
ter." .

UCSD's failure to adjust played

Panther midfielder Gary 
Hurtarte passed the ball back to an 
awaiting Delucca just outside the 
I8-yard box. Delucca promptly 

took a few steps and blasted a 
right-footed missle into the upper 
left corner of the net, tallying what 
proved to be the game-winning 
goal. . 

From that point on, the Tritons 
frantically tried to notch the tying 
score, but their efforts were to no 
avail. 

With 16 minutes left, 
Hetherington's cross from the right 
sideline was headed toward the 
net by junior defender Chris Siok; 
but Panther goaltender Craig 
Bennet was up to the task, snag-
ging the flying shot to preserve the 
1-0 lead. 

UCSD came close again at the 
81:47 mark, when Chapman failed 
to clear a loose ball in front of the 
net, but the Tritons were not able 
to get a foot on it. 

"The whole day was frustrat-
ing," Triton Head Coach Derek 
Armstrong said. "We knew it 
would be a tight game, but I think 
we could ' ve beaten them. We 
didn't make the adjustments we 
usually do. If you want to win 
something, you have to make the 
adjustments. 

"We just weren't quite our-
selves today and all credit to them, 
they were responsible for a lot of 
that. They cut down what we do 
well. Saying that, it was a very 
tight game. The goal [Delucca] 
scored was a game-winning goal. 
Otherwise the game was very 
even," Armstrong added. 

"I think our guys were still 
stinging from the loss to [UCSD] 
in the beginning of October, "Pan-
ther Head Coach Gregg Murphy 
said. "They've been talking about 
it since then. The [guys] wanted to 
play UCSD because it is such a

him tremendously. 

"It is a tough game for anybody 
to lose. We said that [tbe side tbat

Tritons Sucked Up By #3 Anteaters, 15-5 
TROUNCING: Coming off tough games against USC and UCLA, a tired UCSD team wasn't up to the challenge against UCI 

By D ... Kr.rt 
Sports Editor 

No one can ever claim that the UCSD 
men's water-polo team doesn ' t play the 
tougest competition around. When you com-
pete on the West coast, everybody is tough. 
After back-to-back home games against 
polo-powers USC and UCLA, tbe 
Tritons had to recuperate quickly be-
fore going up against tbird-ranked 
UC Irvine on the road. 

Unforunately for the Tritons. the 
pressure of a tbird-consecutive top-
five team proved to be too much. as 
the Anteaters had their way with the 
San Diegans during a 15-5 stomping. 

"Our worst fears came to fruition," 
UCSD Head Coach Denny Harper said. 
"The previous two games took more of a 
toll than any of us had expected." 

lJntrKked: UC Irvine was able to hold the Tritons In check. Including star two-
meter man Mike Nalu. whose offensive output was reduced to a mere 2 goals In 
the 15-5 loss to the third-ranked Anteaters. 

In the early going, the Tritons looked as 
though tbey may have been capable of top-
pling their higbly ranked foe - despite tbe 
disadvantage of playing in Irvine, where 
UCSD has never felt particularly comfort-

"Por whatever reason, we've just never 

played really well up there," Harper said. "I 
don ' t really know what it is." 

Trailing 5-3 in the second quarter, the 
Tritons were definitely in the hunt; and with 
20 ticks remaining on the clock before half-

time, tbey had an opportunity to pull 
to within one. However, an Anteater 
defender stole a pass, and Irvine went 
on tbe attack. depositing the ball be-
hind the UCSD netminder to make 
the score 6-3 before the break. 

The Anteaters opened the scoring 
in tbe second balf of play witb a one-
pointer, which gave them a four-goal 

cushion, 7-3. The two teams Ihen traded 
scores before tbe Tritons reached a second 
critical turning point in the contest. 

With a six-on-five advantage, UCSD 
should have scored to make the outcome 8-
5. Instead. IrVine once again made off with 
an errant Triton pass. turning tbe mistake 
into a three-on-two charge of its own.

UCSD Opens Year

WARM-UP: The Triton women fell to the 
University of San Diego, 167-130, on Saturday 
By Dan Kraft

The Triton women 's swim· 
ming and diving team kicked off 
the aquatics season for UCSD 
when it went up against Division 
I University of San Diego 
on Saturday. Although 
they did not expect to come 
out on top, the Tritons did 
enjoy some success 
against the Toreros, catch-

come this season, during

Byrne began her day by tak-

200 breaststroke (2:27.99). Later 
in the competition, she captured 

first place once again, this 
time in the 200 individual 
medley (2:\3.97).

Tritons Nip Panthers in Four 
CONFIDENCE: UCSD got a much-needed, four-set win against Chapman 
University on Friday and will host the NCAA West Regional this weekend 
By Dan Kraft 
Sports Editor 

The UCSDwomen's volleyball 
team finally gave itself something 
to cheer about Friday night. In 

front of a raucous 
crowd at Chapman 
University, the Tri-
tons captured a solid, 
four -set triumph 
over the fired-up 
Panther squad. 

Chapman had 
strong motivation to 

knock off the underachieving 
UCSD spikers. Ranked fifth in the 
region, and coming off a victory 
over number-four La Verne, the 
Panthers ' playoff hopes would 
have been revived by a defeat of 
the struggling Tritons. That incen-
tive resulted in a boisterous crowd 
with which UCSD had to contend, 
if they hoped to come away with a 
victory. 

UCSD Head Coach Doug 
Dannevik attempted to reverse a 
trend of fast starts and late-game 
collapses by starting youthful sec-
ond-teamers in place of banged-
up standouts, Angelle Crochet and 
Madelyn Ripken. Chapman rev-
elled in the opportunity, cruising 
to the opening set victory by a 15-
4 score. 

UCSD, however, was in no 
mood to be Chapman's stepping

pressure of a fifth set. However, 
they once again fell behind in the 
early going and were trailing 13-
12 late in the game. 

But that is when UCSD stepped 
up, winning three of the next four 
points to take the victory in thrill-
ing fasion, 15-13. 

" That was the kind of match 
that we have not won of late," 
Dannevik said. "We needed to win 
to prove to ourselves that we could 
do it. " 

The Tritons will now begin 
their preparations for next 
weekend's NCAA Regionals. 

It was announced on Sunday 
night that UCSD would be a host 
site for the regional competition 
which will tike place on Friday 
and Saturday.

Panthers Punch Out Tritons, 1-0 
UNTIMELY EXIT: A fired-up Chapman squad knocked UCSD out of 
the NCAA playoffs in a nailbiting, .1-0 game at Triton Soccer Stadium 
By Sun Rahlml 
Associate Sports Editor 

There are times when the 
lesser team prevails in a game it 
did not deserve to win. Other 
times, the better team comes out 
on top because of its superior 
talent and skill. 

And sometimes, two evenly 
matched teams fight an exhaus-
tive battle, where the game is 
decided on one shot or one play. 

On Sunday afternoon, this last 
scenario played itself out in the 
Western Regional Championship 
game between Chapman and 
UCSD. On this day, the seventh-
ranked Panthers scored a late 
goal to defeat the 13th-ranked 
Tritons, 1-0, at Triton Soccer 
Stadium. Senior defender Jason 
Delucca's blast from 20 yards 
out sealed the victory, and a trip 
for 'Chapman to the third round

"Whenever I ,have an oppor-

Delucca said. "As soon liS I bit it,

UCSD Blows By Gusties in OT,2-1 
FINAL FOUR: The Tritons downed Washington (MO), 2-0, on Saturday and came back from 
a one-goal overtime deficit to defeat Gustavus Adolphus and advance to the NCAA semifinals 
By Sean Rahlml 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD women 's soccer team has a 
high-powered offense which is adept at scor-
ing quickly. This talent was never 
more essential than on Sunday, 
as the Tritons found themselves 
trailing in overtime and facing 
elimination from the NCAA 
playoffs. 

In miraculous fashion , UCSD 
came back to score two goals in 
a three-minute span, defeating 
host Gustavus Adolphus, 2-1. 

The sixth-ranked Tritons reached the re-
gional finals by defeating 20th-ranked 
Washington University (MO), 2-0, on Sat-
urday afternoon. UCSD got first-half goals 

from Amanda Johnson and Car-
rie Peer, and then held off a 
second-half charge by the Bears 
to set up the showdown with 
Gustavus. 

UCSD oontinued its domi-
nating play on Sunday versus 
the host GusHes. Even though 
the temperature dropped to the 
low 40s and a strong wind hin-

"We dominated the whole game," Triton 
Head Coach Brian McManus said. "We hit 
a couple of crossbars early, but I told the 
girls to keep it going." 

The first period of overtime was a repeat 
of regulation play, as the Tritons forced the 
action and came close to notching the go-
ahead goal. 

However, Gustavus had other plans as 
the second overtime period started. With 
eight-and-half minutes to go in the game, 
the Gusties surged ahead, 1-0, on a goal by 
Alicia Cordes, seemingly putting the game 
out of reach. 

The Gusties' Colleen Barland got tangled 

by senior defender Matt Chilton 
- whose flying left-footed shot 
went wide of the net, keeping the 
contest scoreless. 

Chapman kept the pressure 
on UCSD throughout the first 
half. While the Panthers moved 
the ball into Triton territory con-
sistently, UCSD did not have the 
same success. 

From the start of the game, 
the Tritons were unable to move 
the ball from their backfield up 
to their forwards with any de-
gree of, efficiency.
