UCSD research 
ranks third 
in spending 

by JeaquID BebIDdu 
Staff Writer 

UC80 again ranked third in 
research and development ex-
penditures, climbing to the heights 
of $82.3 million last year. UCSD 
was succeeded only by the 
University of Wisconsin at 
Madison. and Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology (first and 
second respectively). 

Approx1mately 48 percent of the 
money went to Scripps Institution 
of Oceanography for its Deep Sea 
Drilling Project, ita climatologY 
research, and the maintenance of 
its fleet of ships. Another 25 per-
cent went to the Medical facilities 
here, while the remainder went 
under the catagory of Arts and 
Sciences. 

It was not until the early 70's that 
UC80 began to ascend .to its 
-current status as rwmber three, 
and it has now left the other uc 
campuses far behind, with 
Berkeley coming in eighth and 
UCLA taking the twelfth position. 
stanford was ranked seventh.

Dancing. singing. and literature

. UJS explores Jewish heritage 
through a number of programs 

by Andy Scbadder 
Aaioclate News Bditar 

What does it mean to be Jewish 
and a student at UC80? 

Ralph Grunewald made it 
clear that the Union of JeWish 
studeDts-(UJS) doesn't have a set 
pattern of answers. It does provide 
a chance to "learn and to express 
the Jewish culture and heritage." 

UJS is an " umbrella 
organization for everything that is 
cultural, intellectual, educational 
and political", described 
Grunewald, who chairs the 
planning meetings held every 
Tuesday night. "It operates as a 
framework of group support and 
resource where an individual can 
. bring ideas for projects." 

Grunewald stressed that the 
students. who attend these 
meetings to organize and coor-
dinate are of extremely diverse 
interests. Their backgrounds 
range from Orthodox and Refor-
med Judaism to students who 
question religion and are looking 
for cultural belonging or political 
expression. 

Throughout the Year, UJS 
provides a wide variety of cultural 
experiences. Israeli folk dancing is 
sponsored every Monday night 
with the help of professional in-
structors such as Shlomo Bachar. 
The dancing is "fun, social and it's 
a link to modem Israeli culture," 
he said. 

Dancing, singing, and literature 
are all a part of important Jewish 
holidays celebrated on campus. 
"Judaism is a very symbolic way 
of life," Bachar explained. 
Holidays provide a keeping of 
culture which has 3,000 years of 
tradition. It's not a conservative 
thing at all. These traditions are 
relevant to the way of life today." 

ODe, Sbabbat 

A sense of concern and protec-
tion for the struggling state of 
Israel is also a central facet of UJS 
Israel Awareness Week, a five day 
program of social, political, and 
cultural events, each spring draws 
hundreds of students to its ac-
tivities. . 

Grunewald termed efforts on 
behalf of Israel a "very low key 
approach." 

"The purpose is to educate and 
disseminate information about the 
current situation." UJS monitors 
national andintemational affairs 
which affect Israel. Telegrams 
and letters are sent to public of-
ficials when policies threaten the 
existence of the Jewish homeland. 

The Action Committee for 
{)ppressed Jews tries to raise in-
dlvidual consciousness and public 
awareness of the active 
discrimination repeated in such 
countries as Ethiopia, Syria, 
Argentina and the Soviet Union. 

These concerns and other issues 
are covered in L' Chayim, a 
quarterly campus journal of 
Jewish cultural ideas and political 
events. 

A conclave has also been planned 
for Winter Quarter which will 
center around the theme of Jewish 
mysticism. Three intensive days of 
learning will be conducted by 
experts from Berkeley and UCLA. 

UJS is a group that meets the 
needs of many students, but what's 
the motivation? 

Ralph Grunewald sums up his 
own purpose. "I really fear that 
Jews are becoming assimilated 
into an American way of life. If 
there is a threat to Judaism it is 
security which eliminates the need 
to belong." 

It' ... Its on time at Black' Beach. 

Every other Friday, the sabbath, 
Oneg Shabbat, is celebrated. A 
potluck dinner is always followed 
by a speaker or a performer. 
Vladbnir Tsypin, a violinist who 
has just immigrated from the 
USSR, is scheduled for the next 
gathering. In addition, invitations 
to speak have been given to Dr. 
Richard Friedman, professor of 
Hebrew literature at UC80, aDd 
Dt. Mark Heller, an expert on 
Middle Eastern politics. 

"America is a mosaic, hardly a 
melting pot. Each of us fits a piece. 
Each group should remain a 
diatinct part contributing to the full 
picture." 

Committee 
bringsYote 
to students 

"Local politics do exist. students 
can have a deciding impact, " 
appealed Loren Kaye, AS Com-
munity Relations Advisor. "What I 
really want more than any can-
didate or issue is to get students out 
to vote." 

Kaye announced immediate 
voter registration goals and long 
range plans for student impact on 
the political process. He will be 
serving as student government 
liaison with the recently 
established Student Political 
Action and Registration Com· 
mittee (SPARC). 

SPARC will use community 
resources to register students to 
vote, to provide education on the 
issues and the candidates, to en-
dorse positions of student concern, 
as well as to concentrate on getting 
out the vote at election time. 

The first effort of the comrruttee 
will be to increase the number of 
students eligible to vote. New 
California laws no longer require 
trained registrars. Voter 
registration can be accomplished 
by filling out a simple post card 
application. The committee plans 
to circulate these cards in areas 
where students live in high con-
centration, but in the past have 
failed to switch their voting district 
to their college residence. 

A major strategy of the com-
mittee will be to involve students in 
the issues by personal contact. 
Political action will stress an in-
dividual approach through direct 
mail-outs and door-to-door can· 
vassing . 

Kaye noted that "the biggest 
hurdle to overcome is that students 
don't think they can affect the 
political process." Students 
acquire this impression because 
"the University is a very insular 
community," he commented. 
When students come here, it 
becomes their own protected 
world. But believe it or not, the 
outside world does have a great 
affect on the lives of students and 
the life of the University." 

Students Ftayed a Role 
He points to the Del Mar com-

munity as an example . In the last 
major election , March 1976, 
students played a focal role in 
electing council representatives 
which favored controlled growth 
over the objections of developers. 
As one polarized block faced off 
against the other, he believes the 
student vote, that had been 
organized by the Keep Students In 
Del Mar committee , was the 
deciding factor in the controversy. 

The Del Mar municipal election 
in March will be the first target 
area fOI' SPARC. Students may be 
an important force in preventing 
"the lower and moderate income 
people from being squeezed out of 
town," said Kaye. 

Serving as a member of the Del 
Mar Plalllling Board, Kaye expects 
that the city council will use an 
election code option to place a non-
hin.tI"'(T ('I,,,.o:tlnn nn tt.,. hllllot to 
ascerWn'public opinion on housing 
density. Several UC80 students 
have become proponel1\.lt for a 
density bonus proposal in Del Mar.

Bakke heard today 
The U.8. Supreme Court Is 

scheduled to begin bearing the 
Bakke case today. 

Allan Bakke, a '11 year old 
engineer, claims that he was 
denied admisaion to the UC Davis 
medical school in 1973 and 1974 
because of a special admissions 
procedure which reserves 16 out of 
100 spaces for minority applicants, 
who may be less academically 
qualified than tlleir peers. 

. The California Supreme Court 
agreed with Bakke's claim, and the 
u.s. Supreme Court will hear the 
cue on tile basis of an appeal filed 
by the Unlwrsity of California. 

Bakke's case is bued on a 
charge of reverse discrimination, 
which direCtly violates his Con-
stitutional rights under the 14th 
Amendment. 

UC officlala. in an appeal brief, 
sid "there is no substitute for the 
use of race as a factor in ad-
missions if professional schools are 
to admit more than an isolated few 
applicants from minority groups."

million from the state. In all the 
medical research done here a~ 
proximately ~ million came 
from industry (largely phar-
maceutical finns). 

However, despite the enonnous 
amount of research and 
development money in the budget, 
the funds are very restricted in 
terms of undergraduate ex-
penditure. Less than one third of 
the budget is devoted to un-
dergraduates , even though 80 
percent of the enrollment is un-
dergraduate . The reasons for this 
according to Chancellor McElroy 
comes from the fact that un-
dergraduate expenditures come 
primarily from the state, which 
only contributes 22 percent of the 
budget. 

The future may bring $90 million 
for UCSD and added hopes for the 
inclusion of a cancer facility. 
There will also be a new building 
for the humanities in the con-
tinuing growth of Third College.

The plan would allow up to twice 
the amount of density in some 
zoning a~s than is cw-rently 
penniUed. The additional Wlits 
constructed would be kept at a 
lower rent level in return for 
allowing the construction. 

"It's an appealing optioo to the 
developer," said Kaye. This is a 
contract between the developer 
and the city rather than a law 
restricting enforcement cI. city 
regulation." Although the idea 
meets with the .kept1cism of en-
vironmeralista and may face 
legal cballenles, Kaye leeS the 
plan as an alternative that will

'!be Triton TImes and students of

incredibly deceptive advertising

is unethical. Misleading ad-
vertising of this nature does not fall 
within the rules by which the

unhappy to hear that a shyster

Human rights, Panama Canal 
rights, the right of due process for 
beleaguered Bert Lance - more 
than any other recent president, 
Jimmy Carter has spoken of his 
concern for the people 's rights. 

But like his recent predecessors, 
there is one right bestowed on 
President Carter by a combination 
of technology and the imperial 
presidency that cancels out all the 
constitutional guarantees of every 
American citizen. That is the 
unchecked power to press a button 
that would initiate a nuclear war 
and cause the deaths of hundredCJ 
of millions of people around the 
world - including one-half of 
America's population. 

The Constitution of course 
prohibits the President from 
initiating any war, nuclear or 
ltherwise, vesting that right ex-

clusively in the Congres, but 
Congress has abdicated its nuclear 
responsiblity. 

It has given a single person 
power over life and death - under 
the rationale that it takes only 30 
minutes for a missile with nuclear 
warheads to reach American soil 
from the Soviet Union, and even 
less if the missile is launched from 
a nuclear submarine in the 
Atlantic . Obviously you can't 
assemble 535 members of Congress 
to debate and vote the issue in 
those 15 or 30 minutes. 

What other course is there, then, 
than to let the President make the 
decision? 

Defense Civil Preparedness 
Agency says it will have days and 
probably weeks while diplomats 
negotiate relocation of tens of 
millions of Americans. CR does not 
explain, however, why Congress 
can't be assembled during those 
days or weeks for a debate and 
vole or why a popular referendwn 
can't be conducted. 

The answer probably is that if 
Congress or the people voted 
against a nuclear war the 
American diplomats would have no 
" bargaining chips" in their 
negotiations with the Russians. 
The Soviets, it is said, would make 
no concessions if the nuclear threat 
were removed. Thus, too, the right 
of survival has been replaced by 
the right to be a "bargaining chip." 

Americans have not discussed -
or noticed - this loss of their 
Pl'ecious prerogative because they 
do not believe nuclear war will 
ever come. The great stockpiles of 
warheads, they think, are there 
simply to enforce a permanent 
stalemate, or "balance of terror." 

The U.s. has enough missiles to 
destroy the Soviet Union; they 
have enough to destroy us - no 
matter who strikes first - and 
since each knows that nuclear war, 
in General Douglas MacArthur's 
phrase , is " double-suicide," 
neither superpower wiU ever start 
one. The best proof is that there 
hasn't been any nuclear 
engagement since August 9,1945. 

The " unidentified objects" 
ultimately disappeared from the 
screen, ending the crisis; the best 
guess by Secretary of Defense 
Robert A. Ulvett was that radar

Oddly enough, the same cir-
cumstance that permits "no time" 
to consult Congress before pushing 
the button allows "plenty of time" 
to evacuate citizens from the cities 
and place them in mines, caves 
and rural areas on the eve of a 
nuclear war. 

There are a nwnber of dif-
ficulties with this conventional 
wisdom. The most worrisome 
problem is that since 1950 there 
have been 13 known instances of 
nuclear near-misses, 13 occasions 
when the U.S. actively considered 
using The Bomb. Five of these 
resulted from misreading of radar,

had picked • a Dock of geese. A 
decade later anotber panic 
developed when -radar evidently 
echoed off the moon, and in 1971 
there were three instances of this 
sort. 

In six instances, however, the 
U.S. seriously debated or actually 
threatened the .. of nuclear 
bombs on a limited scale. 
Presidert EilenbOwer records in 
his memoirs, tha& be told the 
OIinese and North Koreans in r. 
he would use nuclear weapons if 
they did not come to terms. In 1954 
the U.S. olered Frarice three 
nuclear bombs to use against the 
Viet Minh at DieDbienpbu and on 
the CblneIe mainland. The BrWab 
and the Sena&e majority leader, 
Lyndon Johnaon, dissuaded the 
Eisenhower Administntion. 

Four years later, the Joint 0Iiefs 
of Staff reconunended, and the 
National Security Council tem-
porarily approved, employment 01 
nuclear weapons in the ~eaioY­
Matsu crisis. President Kennedy's 
team were prepared to drop 
nuclear bombs on Laos in 1961 and 
to use them during the Berlin 
crisis. According to Gen. William 
westmoreland, former us c0m-
mander in Vietnam, nuclear 
weapons were suggested when US 
forces were besieged at the Kbe 
S8mh outpost . 

On two occuiooa the near-
misses involved the two super-
powers directly, and could have 
resulted in total war. In 1962, 
during the Cuban missile crisis, the 
US and the Soviet Union were 
closer to nuclear war than before 
or since. 

And in October 1973, during the 
Yom Kippur war in the Middle 
East, a Soviet ship with nuclear 
bombs was dispatched to 
Alexandria, Egypt, while Richard 
Nixon and Henry Kissinger 
declared a world-wide Defense-3 
nuclear alert. According to a 
reliable Pentagon source, 
Kissinger went so far as to order 
the removal of hatch covers from 
America's land-based ICBMs- - a 
move clearly intended to be 
photographed by Russian satellites 
as proof that America meant 
business. 

What is remarkable about the 
nuclear saga is not only bow close 
we have corne to breaching the 
firebreak between conventional 
and nuclear war; but that 
American presidents always 
assmned they did not have to 
consult the American public on 
employing nuclear weapons. 

Secretary of War Henry Stimson 
told an elite committee in May 1945 
that the atom bomb represents "a 
revolutionary chanl(e ·in the

misses, including the five accident 
situations and the two s~wer

American president even consider

Enlargement of the concept of 
"executive power" began before 
the nuclear age, when President 
Roosevelt told Congress on Se~ 
tember 7,1942, that if Congress 
refused to amend the Emergency 
Price Control Act he would do so on 
his own. "The President," he said, •

After World War D presidents 
ateadUy widened this concept to 
mean they could engage in "acts 01 
War," such ss CIA-sponsored coup 
d'etats, without informing or 
seeking sanction of Congress. 

Moreover, they could conduct 
actual wars, such as Vietnam or 
the landing in the Dominican 
Republic, on the theory that these 
were "police actions" within their 
own prerogative as commander. 
in-chief. And since they considered 
The Bomb as just "another 
weapon" no different from a 
cannonball except for its greater 
firepower, tbey did not believe they 
had to ask congressional approval 
for using it.

At least insofar aa the "right to 

life" i.a concerned that principle 
has been eviscerated. This point 
was bro~ home forcefully a few 
years ago when President Nison 
was on the verge of impeaclunent 
for the Watergate crimes. There 
was genuine fear in high place!lat 
the time that he might use his 
"black box" (with the button in it) 
to launch a nuclear adventure that 
might save him from being ousted.

After the 1962 missile crisis, 
Kennedy stated that had nuclear 
war broken out, "even the fruits 01 
~ctory would have been ashes in 
our mouths." All that the U.S. had 
been able to build in three cen-
turies, he said, would have been 
destroyed within 18 hours. Yet he 
did not ask Congress for a 
declaration of war or seek any 
other fonn of approval for what he 
was doing. 

Plus the guarantee of attending the Navy Nuclear Propulsion 
School after graduation from college. Ifs worth $40,000. 

1'he end result has been an

Playing at the Bellevil~e Dinner Theoter 

1I0klahomal" only adequate 
by Jill Louise Bazeley _ 

Law-ie Lee Schaefer, Miss America 1972, is the featured.artist n the Bellville's 
Dinner Theatre's Wlimaginitive but enjoyabk! production of "Oklahoma!". As 
one Bellville employee put it, "You could say this was like a very good hJgh 
school production." But as a professional revival, Ernest Sarracino's 
"Oklahoma!" is only adequate,even if enjoyable, as the down- on- the-fann, rna 
and pa musical is wont to be. . . 

Schaefer, as LaUfey, gives the impression that she is resting on the laurels 
(rhinestone tiara? ) of her stint as Miss America. She looks, radiates and twinkles 
as only a Miss America can. This is distracting to the production and yet 
capitalized upon by an announcement over the theatre loudspeaker reminding us 
that yes indeed folks, a former Miss America is in ow- midst, as if we can't read 
the program for ourselves. During the performance I kept wondering how 
Schaefer would look with her anns out of her loose-fitting, pink gingham dress 
(a far cry from Shirley Jones' tight bodices) and into a dreamy Catalina s w i m 
suit. Furthermore, the dissident in me, was waiting for Schaefer to prove that 
her Law-ey is not also a beauty queen, but she did not. Her perfonnance is 
sparkly but measured, her voice clear and well trained, but shucks, we hear Bert 
Parks introduce that same likeless soprano every year at Atlantic City. So 
what's new? 

A super soubrette, Ado Annie (Cyndi McCormac) and a good looking Curlf, 
played by Terry Lester, are what's new. Although LesterJooks like the Man from 
Atlantis swam through a bottle of peroxide, he has a hip swivel that's all his own. 
Preswnably, the hips come from ridin' too many hosses, but I prefer to think 
they are affectations. Aside from the fact that Lester can't twirl a lasso, he 
makes a lovable and convincing Curly, goo-goo eyed over Laurey and a tough 
cow-poke to boot. Both Lester's and McCormac's vocal deliveries are big and 
raw, something to be tolerated in musical comedy, where vitalltyand volume are 
what count most of the time. 

A fine actor who does not adhere to this tradition is Samuel Van Dusen, playing 
the menacing Jud. Van Dusen's dramatic bass and Shoenberg-like variations on 
Rogers' score are a deligfitful nuance and needed respite from the sore-throaty, 
nasal voices of too many of the performers. 

The perfonners are accompanied by a gum~ewing trio on piano, percussion 
and bass, who in tum are complemented by adept dishrattling in the theatre's 
kitchen . Although their playing is somewhat anemic and the dishes erratic, the 
performers on stage do well by them. That is, they can be heard. 

The dances, choreographed and not danced enough by Nanon Tygett are the 
high-points of the show. The women are boring, but the men, though not always in 
step, are exciting. Unfortunately , the entire dream-ballet sequence was cut from 
the. production, leaving a lot of loose ends in the plot. "Oklahoma!" without ~e 
dream-ballet is a short, straight-laced musical, but nevertheless has a very nIce 
way of reaching an exciting, foottapping climax in Act II with "The Farmer and 

the Cowman" and the title song, " Perhaps in compen88tion for the 
loss of the dream-ballet the "The Farmer and the Cowman" is 
highlighted very amusingly in with clever lighting by Mike Sinks. 

"Oklahoma!"'s costumes not as good as they should be for a 
professional production. Gelt'tietaunBs (Marie Halton) eye m!JI[eup and 
lipstick are from last and the age makeu~ are from 
last year's high school play. dresses, borrowed fonn the Fullerton 
Civic Light Opera, are pretty, the woman like gunney sacks, with not 
one inch of sternum, much less showing. Laurey's wedding gown, on 
the other hand, is tight-fitting attractive, but still afflicted with a 
high collar . Sarracino gave us "Man of La Mancha"; what hap-
pened here? " Oklahoma!" is without extra help . 

Food at Bellville's (a alley) is all ri~t if roast beef or 
chicken are to your taste the salads. The service, however, is 
pleasant (paper napkins if it is your birthday, the waiters 
Toppers, Will sing to you. 

The Toppers also do the a pre-show mishmash of Broadway 
tunes. This is usually poor but y had an excuse due to them all being 
new Toppers after a great out on opening night. Still, given the

Kalapana's hawaiian rock ' 
greeted by sell-out crowds 

bylWBulett 

The Hawaiian rock of Kalapana 
returned to San DIego this past 
weekend for the first time since 
May of 1976 and was greeted by two 
sell-4lt audiences at San Diego 
State's Backdoor. 

Kalapana's appearance on the 
stage was received with a warm 
ovation. Their opening, "Tally Me 
Bananas/When Morning Comes", 
a Hall " Oates tune, got the 
audience going. The band took 
advantage of this crowd response 
for the remainder of their 90 
minute set. Kalapan8 mixed songs 
from their first three albums with 
new material from a movie sound 
track which is due early next year. 
"Songbird", Seasons" and 
"1boughts m You", all from 
Kalapaaa m (with the latter two 
showcasing new member Randy 
Aloya on lead vocals), were among 
the most popular tunes with the 
audience. Other crowd-pleasers 
included songs from their first 
album; "You Make It Hard", "The 
Hurt", and "Nightbird", featuring 
the flute m Michael Paulo. "I'd 
Chase a Rainbow" and "Freedom 
from Kalapa.. 11 showed the 
versatility m this auspicious group . 
·The fine lead vocals of Malani 
Bilyeu an Randy Aloya, combined 
with excellent harmonles, were 
reminiscent m Loggins & Messina 
and America; yet they still have 
that distinct touch that sets them 
apart from all the others. The solo 
Instrumentals by D.J. Pratt on 
electric and acoustic lead guitar 
prompted ovations. The crowd

State'. Badcdoor Saturday . 

definitely got what they came 
for-a superb show. 

Kalapana, literally translated 
"beat of the music", is riding on 
the success of their new albwn 
KalapaD8 m, currently moving up 
the charts . The album differs from 
those of the group's past, filling in 
the void of the song writing and 
vocals left by former mainstay 
Mackey Feary, who left the band 
due to· the heavy touring. Malani 
Bilyeu sees the band as continuing 
their popularity and direction 
despite the loss of F'eary . " We are 
still heading in the same direction 
we would have been even with 
Mackey," says Bilyeu. We picked 
up Randy (Aloya) and he has filled 
in and added a lot. " 

The soundtrack for a soon-to-be-
released surf film was a new ex-
perience for the band, " It was 
really different trying to write to a 
visual, it's no easy thing." states 
D.J. Pratt. 

This island-bred team has long 
since passed Cecilio & Kapono as 
the sweethearts of Hawaii and are 
currently touring the mainland, 
playing before capacity crowds 
everywhere, receiving rave 
reviews on the East Coast. 
Keyboard player Kirk Thompson 
pointed out that "We weren't sw-e 
how we would do when we playe.d 
back there in cities like 
Washington (D .C. ) and in places 
like North carolina and Kentucky, 
but we did really well." 

Kalapana is rapidly building a 
following and is a band, with a bit 
more polish which will have to be 
reckoned with soon.

Women spikers vie in All-Cal: 
"Physically ov~rwhelmed" in meet 

By saepbea D. Meglio 
Staff Writer 

Triton Coach Randy Stevenson 
took an inexperienced women's 
volleyball squad to UC Irvine last 
week for the 5th annual All-Cal 
Tournament. Physically over· 
whelmed throughout the com· 
petition, UCSD folded in four 
straight matchesj losing to UC 
Berkeley, UC Riverside, UC Irvine 
and UC Davis respectively. 

Disunity in the long rallies and 
failure to stay close through the 
final points appeared to be the 
Tritons' main setbacks. According 
to coach Stevenson, the women's 
team played well through the first 
half of each game but consistently 
failed in the stretch due to their 
lack of experience. UC San Diego's 
closest bid came in a 10-15 lou to 
Berkeley! who reached the finala 
along witn UC Riverside.

A gtoup that can be estimated at 
more than 1700 return to Del Mar 
for each acbool year. Although 
many would lUte to stay year 
round, rental rates sometimes 
triple over the summer. 1bese 
students are conaiate .. residents of 
Del Mar. "'lbe Del Mar student 
community Is a community within 
a city. There Is a strong identity of 
these student as Del Mar 
residents," said Kaye. Even as 
residents, these studelU must be 
voters to run the affairs of their 
clty. 

SP ARC Is looking even further 
into the future and bope to expand 

its activities to the student com-
mlmities located in Pacific Beach. 
Ocean Beach and North County. In 
the JlDle general election, the race 
of Escondido City CouncUperson 
against Incwnbent lee Taylor in 
the fifth supervisorial district may 
be important to students on the 
housing Issue. 

AIJ an advisor to AS President 
Jeff LeIfer, Kaye will help to 
coordinate the student voter effort 
that will be joinUy directed by AS 
External Commissioner Bob 
Drapeau and Lobby Annex 
Director Phil Isaac. The AS will be 
working to establish a metro 

- ..... 

desk that prpvides student lo~ 
bying on issues before local city 
governments that effect the 
student community. Effect1ve 
student involvement in locid af-
fairs through a lobby operation is 
one of the many campaign 
promises df several AS officers. 
Although the AS governments 

on several UC campuses have 
encouraged successful legislation 
on behaH on student conununities 
surrounding their schoolS"; 
ASUCSD must work with a 
dispersed student population that 
Is concentrated in several different 
voting districts and cities.
