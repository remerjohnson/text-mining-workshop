Students charged for 
mandatory insurance 
Regents require 
health insurance 
for undergrads 
ByCLAIREVANNETTE 
Senior Staff Writer 

Starting this quarter, the UC 
Board of Regents is requiring all 
UC undergraduates to have health 
insurance. The mandate was made 
Sept. 14,2000 after about five years 
of debate, said UC Regents spokes-
woman Mary Spletter. 

The measure was recommend-
ed by UC President Richard 
Atkinson and was passed "almost 
unanimously," Spletler said. 

While the university has long 
required health insurance for its 
graduate and international students, 
Spleuer explained that "changes in 
the health care situation have made 
it more critical for all students to 
have health insurance." 

She cited the growing num~r 
of students who rely upon HMOs, 
which often do not provide ade-

quate care, and the increasing 
socio-economic diversity of the 
university, which has resulted in 
fewer students being insured 
through their parents. 

Before the measure was passed, 
about 40 percent of UC under-
graduates were uninsured or 
underinsured, according to Suzette 
Tsiknas, director of administrative 
services at UCSD Student Health 
Services. Drop-outs due to mount-
ing health care costs or the need 
for treatment at students' homes, 
which may be far from San Diego, 
were becoming more frequent. 

"There was wide acceptance of 
the need for something [to address 
these problems] ." Spletter said. 
"We've been hearing from too 
many campuses that undergradu-
ates have had to leave [the univer-
sity] due to health issues." 

A universitywide task force was 
created to establish requirements 
for campuses' individual p.lans. 
UCSD had to respond quickly to 
develop its own plan that adhered 
to UC standards and met students'

News of last week's ter-
rorist attacks hit the 
UCSD community quickly, 
prompting swift response 
from the administration . 

Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Joseph 
Watson met with his coun-
cillast week to discus~ what 
steps the administration 
would take. The council 
decided to keep the campus 
open and to communicate 
directly with the UCSD 
community, providing sup-
port to individuals who 
might be affected either 
'directly or indirectly by the 
tragedy. 

Hundreds of people and 
local news crews gathered in 
the Price Center on two 
separate occasions last week. 

The first time, it was for 
a memorial service hosted 
by the Office of Religious 
Mfairs on Wednesday, Sept. 
12, the day after the terror-
ist attacks. 

Friday, a ceremony was 
. held recognizing Sept. 14 as 

a Day of National Prayer 
and Remembrance . At 
noon, UCSD joined other 
UC campuses in observing 
a moment of silence for the 
deceased and others who 
were affected. 

According to Chancellor 

Robert C. Dynes, it was an 
occasion to join with the 
nation to grieve, heal and 
regain hope for a better 
future. 

At the service, Dynes 
called the attacks "unimag-
inable" and said he felt 
"horror, anger, sorrow, con-
fusion and disbelief." 

bons adorned campus trees 
to symbolize the UCSD 
community'S solidarity, and 
organizers passed out 
UCSD lapel pins to reflect, 
as Dynes said, "who we are, 
and how we have and how 
we will band together.

UCSD students stranded 
FAA shutdown leaves 
many without a way 
back to school 
By LAUREN I. COARTNEY 
Senior Staff Writer 

Many UCSD students are having 
trouble getting to campus in time for 
the new academic year because of the 
Sept. II terrorist attacks on the East 
Coast. 

Commercial flight schedules are still 
unpredictable a week after the Federal 
Aviation Administration's decision to 
ground all flights in response to the 
attacks. 

Warren sophomore Alex Simma, 
who was in Washington, D.C. last week, 
made it back to campus Sept. 14. 

"I'm still hoping and praying that 
we will not be stranded," Simma said

Triton Ta.xi expands to Ciaslamp 
A.S. looks to provide service to border 
By MARGARET O'NEILL 
News Editor 

The A.S. Council's safe ride pro-
gram, Triton Taxi, has expanded to 
serve the Gaslamp district, an area in 
downtown San Diego famous for its 
bars and clubs. 

Triton Taxi also serves La Jolla, 
Pacific Beach, Clairemont, 
University City, Mission Bay and 
Mira Mesa. 

Triton Taxi, like San Diego State 
University's safe ride program, con-

vides vans and dispatch services. 
SDSU's program already served the 
Gaslamp district, and Triton Taxi was 
able to expand without incurring any 
additional cost to the A.S. Councilor 
to students. 

"This expansion is the first of sev-
eral planned expansions of the Triton 
Taxi program," said A.S. 
Commissioner of Services and 
Enterprises Colin Parent. "What's so 
great about this ... is that because 
Cloud 9 a Iready services the Gaslamp 
District, we can expand without hav-
ing to front any setup costs."

The Gaslamp was, according to 
Parent, one of the 'two most request-
ed areas for expansion, along with the 
U.S.-Mexican border. Service may 
later expand to the border. 

"Myself and the rest of the Unity 
slate campaigned on expanding 
Triton Taxi in some form or another 
to the border," Parent said. "We've 
already had preliminary discussion 
with Cloud 9 and the Student Safety

Simma, but campus departments are 
prepared for students who will be' 
returning late due to increased air trav-
el security precautions and repeated air-
port shutdowns. 

"We're not going to take any 
adverse actions based on individuals 
not being here on time," said Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Joseph 
Watson . "I think everybody wants to 
be understanding and accommodat-
ing. This is a time of great emotional 
stress and we're working together as a 
community and a campus to make sure 
everybody comes through this posi-
tively." 

Watson understands that some stu-
dents may be stranded in other sta~es or 
other counuies, and says that students 
will not be forced to forfeit their on-
campus housing or forced to drop class-
es due to an unexpectedly late arrival. 

He said that professors will most 
likely take students' word on the issue. 

"We're going to make the assump-
tion that people are prevented from 
getting here," Watson said. "In some 
cases, documentation may be required." 

Eleanor Roosevelt college is being 
hI! especia lly hard because man)' 
International House reSidents are 
coming from other countries. 

"We have students who are sti ll stuck 
in Asia," aid Roosevelt Provost 
Executive Assistant Margaret 
Manoguerra. "We expect 15 freshmen to 
have to have special advising and enroll-
ment. They've been trickling in, but 
we're getting calls from more students." 

Other UCSD colleges are preparing 
for students who are stranded as well. 

"We're figuring out how to do 
makeup tests for the subject A require-
ment and makeup orientations," said 
Ann C. Dodd &om the Warren college 
provost's office. 

Kevin Olson, a Revelle junior, was 
stranded in northern Canada on a fam-
ily vacation. 

"I have driven over 4,400 kilome-
ter in the past week," Olson said. 

Approximately 1,600 of those were 
to get back to his family home in the 
Bay Area. _ 

"We had two nights canceled in 
Vancouver, then we had a night canceled 
in cattle, then one in Portland, so we 
finally just drove back [to the Bay Area]," 
Olson said. "I may have to take the train 
&om the Bay Area to San Diego." 

It took Olson two hours to get 
through customs at the U.S.-Canadian 
border. 

"There was seriously over a mile of 
cars," he said. 

Airport security was tight at all three 
airports. 

"In Vancouver, we couldn't get with-
in half a mile of the airport," Olson said. 
"It was pretty much the same in Seattle. 
In Portland they let us in the airport but 
canceled our flight." 

While the delays and uncertainty are 
inoonveniences to some UCSD students 
who will have to catch up with their class-
es, Simma said he is not angry. 

"I'm understanding," said Simma 
about the delays, which he described as 
increased vigilance at the baggage scan-
ner and the outright cancellation of 
flights. "But it was certainly a big let-
down ." 

Many expected the air travel situa-
tion to improve after the FAA allowed 
ai rports to reopen on an individual 
basis, depending on whether they had 
met new security guidelines. 

However, bomb threats and other 
disturbances, which are being taken 
very seriously in the wake of last 
week 's attacks, have further kept 
things from returning to normal.

University of Wisconsin at Madison and the 
University of Texas at Austin. 

UCSD ranked 31 st amon~ all universities, public 
and private. Princeton University topped the l is~ with 
Harvard in second and Yale rounding out the top three. 

Coleman named UC vice 
provost for research 

Lawrence B. Coleman of UC Davis, a former chair 
of the Academic Council of the UC system, was 
named vice provost for research at the office of the 
UC President in early Au~ust. . . 

The 53-year-old phYSI~ist has served as Intenm 
vice provost for research since Jan. 1. 

Coleman's responsibilities will include the coor-
dination of research matters among the Office of the 

Presiden~ the 10 campuses and the three n~tional 
laboratories the development of the UC position on 
research po'licy and to provicJ.e leadership in identi~­
ing and developins strategic responses to malor 
research opportunilies. 

Coleman, a graduate of Johns Hopkins University 
and the University of Pennsylvania, has completed 
research at UC Davis, focusing on the use of infrared 
and far infrared spectroscopy to investigate the 
effects of disorder on the properties of solids. He 
taught undergraduate classes in solid state physics, 
thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. 
UCSD neurosurgeon completes 
50's first gamma knife surgery 

John Alksne, M.D., performed San Diego's first 
gamma knife surgeries on Katrina Corbell and Gloria 
Corral in August. 

The gamma knife. surgery is a. treatment .for 
epilepsy. The noninvaSive procedure IS an altematlve 
treatment to brain surgery, using fine beams of radi-
ation instead of a knife. 

The gamma knife is a medical instr~ment that 
emits 201 fine beams of radlatlon that Intersect at 
the location of the brain disorder. 

This kind of surgery does not remove abnorn:'al 
cells like regular surgery. Rather, It chang~s the blp-
chemistry to stop the spontaneous electncal activity 
that causes seizures. 

With this kind of surgery, seizures do not stop 
completely for nine to 12 months. Instead, they 
gradually diminish over time. . . 

Corbell is a 23-year-old Clalremo~t reslden~ and 
Corral is a 57-year-<JId South Bay reSident.

Lynn Neu from the Catholic 
Community at UCSD; and rabbi 
Lisa Goldstein from the Union of 
Jewish Students. 

Padrez said that the ceremony 
was intended to "galvanize our feel-

be expressed in a very positive and 
life-giving way." He also hopes that it 
"propels us to offer hope, faith and 
encouragement to one another." 

The quiet crowd listened as speak-
ers said prayers and recited Bible vers-
es. Violinist and UCSD graduate stu-
dent Rownmel Marcia played. Some

show compassion and strength." 
Watson has created a committee 

to discuss how to help students deal 
with the tragedy. The committee 
quickly sent a letter to UCSD 
employees and posted news on the 
campus Web site. A letter to students 
was sent soon after, indicating that 
the fa ll quarter and move-in would 
occur on schedule. The letter also 
stated that religious and psychologi-
cal counseling were available for stu-
dents. 

UC students participating in an 
exchange in Washington, D.C. were 
oontacted and confirmed safe. 

"We wish to bring some normal-
cy to the situation, therefore we're 
going to try to make sure we work 
closely with students," Watson said. 
"I think we're all deeply concerned 
about what has occurred, and have a 
great deal of sympathy and empathy 
for those who have been impacted." 

The deans, academic advising and 
residence life offices at each college 
will also remain flexible to accommo-
date the needs of students, Watson 
said . 

Watson described what would be 
done to ensure the school 's safety. 

"If there was any indication that 
there's a credible threat ... we defi-
nitely would declare a campus emer-
gency," Watson said. 

In an e-mail message sent Sept. 
II, UC President Richard Atkinson 
expressed his though ts. 

"I know that all of you are 
shocked, as I am, by the terrible 
tragedies that have occurred today 
in New York and Washington, 
D.C., and that many of you have 
friends and family in those 
regions," Atkinson stated. "The 
university will remain open. I am

~ Current plans for funding stem cell pro research do not grant scientists enough license to make worthwhile discoveries 
By JENNIFER SPOSITO 
Opinion Editor 

It has been a little over five weeks since 
President George W Bush unveiled his plan 
concerning the role of federal funding in stem 
cell research. The Aug. 9 announcement - an 
attempt to sate groups with wildly differing 
stances on the issue - can be seen as a partial 
victory for those who advocate stem cell 
research for a variety of purposes. 

However, Bush's proposal will demon-
strate, if anything, that more government 
involvement is necessary - that what has 
already been approved is far shon of what is 
required to facilitate any sort of scientific 
breakthrough. With stringent yet scientifically 
guided regulation, the benefits of stem cell-
research can become actuality. 

Bush's plan allows for 64 existing lines of 
stem cells, which are in fertility clinics around 
the United States in embryos never used for 
fertilization, to be experimented upon with the 
use of federal funds. The plan does not permit 

the use of any stem cell lines that may become 
avai lable subsequent to the Aug. 9 announce-
ment date; until further notice, 64 is all that 
scientists in the United States will be able to 
access. 

Even at this point, the Bush plan is fraught 
with problems. Expens have testified that the 
quality of embryonic cells deteriorates over 
time. Subsequently, it can be expected that the 
64 existing stem cell lines will be subject to the 
same problem, leaving scientists with a dwin-
dling and disintegrating supply. 

In fact, it appears that 64 is too generous an 
estimate. Bush's own Secretary of Health and 
Human Services Tommy Thompson testified 
before the Senate last month that only about 
25 of the existing embryonic cell lines are 

. robust enough for experimentation. 
If that were not enough, the existing cells 

may also be contaminated because of the way 
in which they were nourished. All 64 cell lines 
were supplied with mouse cells for sustenance,

The benefits that could come of stem cell ~ 
research cannot surpass the unresolved moral con 
issues that such research would bring 

By MARY-ON EllA ESTUDILLO 
Staff Writer 

Last week while making dinner, I heard on 
television: "People tell us that we should just 
let go of our dead son. But now we are in an 
age where we don't have to." A bereaved father 
was on a news show, talking about his intent to 
clone his son. 

Understandably, he is grieving. But to talk 
about recreating his son as if it were as easy as 
going to a store and exchanging a damaged 
appliance for a good one is morbid and 
appalling. 

The successes resulting &om stem cell 
research amount to some of the greatest scien-
tific breakthroughs ever developed. But is 
society ready for the consequences that over-
shadow this technological triumph? 

Because embryonic stem cells have the 
potential to transform themselves into any 
other kind of cell in the body, they have been 
considered the next revolutionary cure of the 
new century, since they can lead to possible 

treatments for Alzheimer's disease and Type I 
diabetes. 

While many praise the benefits of rCl;ener-
ating lost body parts or organs and even saving 
lives, it is important to note that stem cell sci-
ence is still in its infancy and, ifleft to arbitrary 
discretion, could cause more-harm than good. 
True, stem cell research may lead to the abili-
ty to regenerate lost organs, supply cures for 
deadly diseases and enhance life-saving thera-
py, but it is also a weapon that must be con-
trolled. 

Let's not forget about ethics. I am not 
advocating an immediate halt ~n stem cell 
research, but society must be restrained from 
using such advanced technology for selfish, 
irrational and even whimsical reasons - main-
ly, the cloning of human beings. 

The problem with widespread stem cell 
technology is that it is prone to be used for 
cloning. Whether for people or animals, stem 
cell regeneration used for anything other than

What every freshman should know 
Partying can enliven dorm life - with the proper precautions 

I t only took one secona to shatter 
the normalcy and 
calm of Sept. 11, 
2001. 

I walked into the Georgetown 
Criminal Justice Clinic in 
Washington, D.C. at 9 a.m. and 
heard the stunned scream from my 
attorney: A plane crashed into the 
World Trade Center in New York. 

In a matter of seconds, everyone 
in the office crowded around its two 
televisions and watched with growing 
horror as another plane hit the south 
tower. 

Confusion and dismay gave way 
to pain, anger and the cold certainty 
that it was a deliberate terrorist 
attack. Then, cold fury as one 
mantra-like phrase stuck in my head: 
Those bastards! 

Thousands must be dead. I didn't 
kno~ who was responsible, but I 
hated them as I continued to witness 
the horrific damage they inflicted. 

It only took a second to throw 
our lives into chaos. But fear and 
panic did not fully strike us until we 
heard that the Pentagon was also 
attacked. 

All I could think was: Not here, 
please God, not here! But the night-
mare in New York became terrifying 
reality in Washington: We were 
under attack. •

By IVAN DAIlY 
Staff Writer 

Welcome to UCSD, freshmen! 
After four years of arduous study, 
despotic parents and far too many 
rules, are you ready to party like 
there's no tomorrow? Dying to join 
a beer-guzzling frat straight out of 
"Animal House?" Been dreaming of 
a sunny San Diego college where the 
beer nows like a mountain stream 
and the weed grows like, well, 
weeds? Are you ready for a school 
where you can drink and party 24-7 
with no repercussions? 

Well then, you should've gone to 
San Diego State. 

This is UCSD, and as you'll soon 
find out, your local resident dean 
really wasn't lcidding: The school 
will enforce the legal drinking age of 
21. Who knew? 

Your resident advisor will con-
stantly be on the lookout for parties, 
and the numerous resident security 
officers will patrol the campus and 
scour your suites for alcohol. If 
caught, you get to book an appoint-
ment with your dean, who will in 
turn reserve a spot for you in an 
alcohol awareness class. 

And frat parties? I hope you have 
a buddy with a car and low expeCta-
tions. Unless you want to hitch a 
ride down to Tijuana every week-
end, you'd better learn how to party 
on campus - and get away with it. 

As tyrannical as the administration 
is, not only can you enjoy a blissfully 
impaired partying experience, but you 
won't get aught in the process. The 
only resource more useful to you than 

this article is EDNA, so remember 
everything you read here, and you'll 
learn the easy way. 

It's simple: If you don't want to 
get caught, don't get rowdy. The 
flfSt tip-off to RAs and RSOs is 
noise. Even if you don't think you're 
being loud, your noise is still audible 
from the ground and its origin is 
easy to trace. You should keep win-
dows and doors shut, and stay off t.he 
balcony. It might get a little hot, but 
it's better than the 

denly "out of town." If it's too late to 
slam the door, make sure there's a 
place to hide all the alcohol. Even if 
the people in the suite are busted, at 
the very least, you won't have to pour 
all that alcohol down the sink. After 
all, a good beer is a terrible thing to 
waste. 

Along those lines, make sure 
everyone drinks from plastic cups. 
They're pretty blatant, but better that 
than being aught with a beer bottle 

in your hand. If 
RSOs breathing 
down your neck. 
We all know how 
loud drunks can be, 
so use your best 
judgment and keep 
them under wraps. 
Then again, you're 
going to be drunk 
too, so what's your 
best judgment 
wonh, anyway? 

Are you ready for 
a school where 

you can drink and 
party 24-7 with no 

repercussions? 

there's any time to 
spare, you an shove 
the cups into the 
traSh bag you dili-
gently hid in the lit-
tle space between 
the wall and the 
couch. 

Well then, you 
should've gone to 

San" Diego State. 

If you get 
pinched and are 
lucky enough to be 
on the first noor, 
then you have one Don't rely too 

much on the lock 
on your suite door. RSOs and RAs 
have keys and no qualms about barg-
ing in. There will always be some 
sober people watching out for every-
one, so ' make sure they're also 
watching the door. If you're really 
on the ball, you'll have somebody 
outside to greet the RSOs and RAs 
as they come to break it up. You'll at 
least have a little more warning, and 
valuable time to hide your alcohol. 

Remember, to keep the bar in one 
of the rooms, preferably the one far-
thest from the suite door. Once 

there~ trouble, you shut the door, hit 
the lights, and the inhabitants are sud-

other option: Run! I 
am not suggesting that you should 
hop a balcony and run from authori-
ties, but odds are that you'd get away. 
Of course, if you accidentally sprain 
your anlcle in the process, then at least 
you won't worry about getting caught 
any more. 

You also have to remember that 
time is a factor. From II p.m. to I 
a.m. on Friday and Saturday, the 
RAs will visit every suite, looking 
for parties. This is the trickiest part, 
since you know a visit is inevitable. 
If you're a smart partier, though, it's 
also the easiest. Hopefully, your RA 
will visit you nice and early, before 

your guests even arrive. Otherwise, 
you need to find a way to keep tabs 
on them. Once you know an RA is 
on his way up, make sure all your 
guests are the upstanding young 
citizens they're expected to be. You 
sti ll have to watch for RSOs, but 
you don't have to worry as much 
after 3 a.m., once they throw their 
own coffee and doughnut party 
over at Earl's Place . • 

If worst comes to worst, you'll get 
caught. They'll look at you and ask, 
"Who here has been drinking?" Look 
them in the eye and honestly tell 
them, "It wasn't me!" Shrugging 
shoulders and confused facial expres-
sions complement this line well. 

Unfortunately, those guys tend 
to be smarter than we like to think 
they are, so this might not work. 
Your best bet may then be JUSt to 
shut up and cut your losses. 

Go chill with the resident advi-
sor, sleep through your alcohol 
awareness class and write your resi-
dent dean a CUle paper about what 
you pretended to learn in that class, 
and everything will be all but forgot-
ten. Generally, three write-ups is 
when you're really in trouble. Then 
again, I have known guys who claim 
to have been written up as many as 
seven times and still live on campus. 

Hopefully, this will help you make 
the best of your early experiences here 
at UC San Quen ... err, San Diego. It 
took me all oflast year to figure most 
of that out, so maybe you won 't get 
caught as often as I did. 

Remember: If an RSO asks if you 
want to go to detox, the answer is a 
definite "no."

A6 OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Helms' departure is welcome 
Retiring senator leaves a legacy of discrimination 
By VALERIE BURNS 
Staff Writer 

Goodbye, Jesse Helms, hello 
Elizabeth Dole! 

Helms, arguably the most conser-
vative and powerful politician of the 
last half of the 20th century, is num-
bering his days on Capitol Hill . 

Should we embrace one another 
in solemn remembrance of him? 

Hell no! 
Raise your hands to the sky and 

praise glory that Homophobe No. I, 
the man with the hate, the mortal 
enemy of federal arts funding, is 
headed home to Raleigh, N.C. In 
2003, Helms is leaving to die in the 
garbage in which he was raised. 

It is not hard to explain the rea~n 
for this article - one intended to 
create mass hatred for a man - con-
sidering I am speaking as the voice of 
a liberal institution. 

Helms is against most of what this 
university stands for: the implemen-
tation of diversity and the openness 
to give students a liberal education. 
Over the years, "Senator No" has 
attacked many things that had possi-
ble repercussions at UCSD. 

In 1984, he was influential in argu-
ing to abolish the National 
Endowment for the Arts. That year, in 
Cincinnati, the Coalition for Family 
Values brought a suit against a muse-
wn that planned to show an NEA pro-
ject by Raben Mapplethorpe. Some of 
the project's pictures had homosexual 
and pornographic content. 
Nonetheless, it was art. 

Many believe that Helms, who 
seems to be influential in the CFY, 
was trying to curb First Amendment 
rights. The excuse was that the ~ 
money is government money and 
that its projects should therefore fit a 

particular "moral" character -
according to, well, Helms himself. 

The coalition lost the case. Even 
so, damage had already been done to 
the NEA. The status of the NEA has 
been questioned ever since. 

Jesse Helms ultimately gave up 
the fight, in a famous congressional 
deal that was called "Corn for Porn." 
The NEA was allowed to continue 

Helms is against most 
of what this university 

stands for: the 
implementation of 

diversity and the 
openness to give 
students a liberal 

education. Over the 
years, 'Senator No' has 

attacked many things 
that had possible 

repercussions at UCSD. 

giving its liberal grants while Helms 
and his conservative peers were 
appeased with higher corn prices for 
their farmer constituents. 

Helms took advantage of a situa-
tion ripe for controversy. He is inge-
nious here in that he Icnew that the 
NEA was important enough to 
Democrats that they would engage in 
collective pork barreling to protect it. 

Helms' unease with "moral" 
change is what has defined his career 
and given him his niclcname. 

Before entering politics, he was a 
television broadcaster and an aide for 
segegrationist senatorial candidate 
Willis Smith. . 

Yes, that's right: segregationist 
Helms is from the segregationis, 
camp. Segregation is the ultimatt 
fight against change. 

During those days, Helms was ~ 
conservative Democrat. The JNI't) 
divide that came with Presidenl 
Lyndon B. Johnson in the late 19605 
steered Helms into the Republican 
Pany. 

He was elected to the Senate in 
1972 and has served his Nonh 
Carolina constituents ever since. 

He has been most influential in 
the last few years of his career. In 
1995, he was elected chairman of the 
Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, and could broadcast his 
views from that perch. Helms had the 
power to stall much legislation to sat-
isfy his own agenda. 

For example, he helped stall the 
confirmation vote on openly gay 
James Hormel as ambassador to 
Lu!,embourg. Hormel was finally 
sworn in in June 1999 after a 
November 1997 recommendation by 
the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee. 

Most recently, Helms helped pass 
a bill to protect the Boy Scouts of 
America from being excluded from 
meeting on public propeny -
schools and the like - based on the 
organization's own discrimination 
against homosexuals. 

Winnie Stachelberg, political 
director of the Human Rights 
Campaign, summed up the views 01 
the gay community on Helms' 
approaching retirement. 

"Senator Helms has used his 
power at every tum to harm the [gay) 
community and people with AIDS," 
she said. "His retirement is not

Campus art merits 
consideration 
Stuart Collection pieces showcase 
an array of styles and messages 
By ANDREW FU 
Staff Writer 

While touring UCSD for the first 
time a few years ago, I couldn't help 
but notice the five big stone blocks 
sitting out in the middle of Marshall 
field. Confused but intrigued, I asked 
the equally clueless tour guide what 
the blocks were sup-

would share this feeling if they took 
more time to understand the creative 
expression of the artists who have 
worked on these outdoor sculptures. 

Upon closer examination, 
"l)'NDA" reveals a much more subtle 
appeal for those who need more than 
stone haystacks to be intellectually 
stimulated . Hopefully, that's you, 

UCS D students 
posed to be. 
_ "Some artist, a 

guy named Stuart or 
something, makes 
these weird sculp-
tures all over cam-
pus," he said. "I 
think the blocks are 
supposed to repre-
sent haystacks." 

Trying to salvage 
his tour guide image, 
he quicldy turned 
our attention to 
something he had 
real Icflowledge of: 

It seemed to me 
that there was 

more to the Stuart 
Collection than big 

ugly haystacks 
that weren't really 

haystacks at all. 

with your average 
S.A.T. score of 
1259. 

Each block con-
tains the letters U, 
N, D and A, but 
arranged in differ-
ent order. An s-
shaped symbol is 
placed between let-
ters, which is a 
proofreader'S mark 
that means "trans-
pose these letters." 
Once all the trans-

Some of these 
sculptures might 

even be cool. 

those cool "Andre the Giant Has a 
Posse" stickers. 

As is the case with much of the 
Stuart Collection at UCSD, Ian 
Hamilton Finlay'S "UNDA" - or, 
"Big Ugly Haystacks," as I like to call 
them - is underappreciated and mis-
understood. 

None of the sculptures is pro-
duced by a guy named Stum. Th!! 
collection is named after the Stuan 
Foundation, which sponsors the 
artists. 

Despite a bad first impression, I 
have grown to enjoy the Stuart 
Collection. I think more students 

posing - fancy talk 
for "discombobulating" - is 
through, each block spells the word 
UNDA.

stay inside the office? Or should we 
try going to the underground park-

bomb shelter? 

Outside, the city was in chaos. 
Capitol Hill , the White House, all 
federal buildings and most business-
es were evacuated. People ran fran-
tically as the police ran in fonnation

our windows, we could see the

In fact, we hadn't been hit. But 
the uncenainty was frightening in 
itself. The news that the final miss-

in Pennsylvania eased our panic a 
little. We hoped the attack was over.

Beef: It's not just what's for dinner any more 
Before dismissing vegetarianism, critics should give thought to its more obfuscated benefits 
By ALEX J. LEE 
Senior Staff Writer 

There is one issue that I do not 
like to talk about, despite the fact that 
I feel strongly about it. I always fear 
that in explaining the reasons behind 
my actions, I will unwittingly rurn 
people off by appearing to be too 
preach y. And so, for the most part, I 
have kept my mouth shut. 

Despite my reluctance, over the 
years I have become more assertive. I 
find the issue relevant and yet so 
absent from our daily discussions. 
\Vhat is this taboo topic, the very 
mention of which I fear may incite an 
outpouring of angry responses) 
Animal rights, of course. . 

A dirty phrase for many, a per-
plexity for others, animal rights 
always seems to get a bad rap. Many 
arguments in support of it remain the 
same trite and overly emotional 
cliches such as, "Don't eat meat, 
you're murdering innocent lives," or 
"Animals are more important than 
humans." which usually rurn people 
off Instead of piquing their curiosity. 

I support the struggle of these 
people, but not their methods. In 
my experience, this kind of lan-
guage usually fails miserably and 
only makes the most fervent skep-
tics more skeptical. 

People for the Ethical Treaonent 
of Animals, the largest animal rights 
organization in the United States, 
defines animal rights as consideration 

for an animal's best interests regardless 
of whether the animal is cute, useful to 
humans or an endangered species, and 
regardless of whether any hwnan cares 
about it at all- just as a mentally chal-
lenged human has rights even if he is 
not cute, useful or universally liked. 

While I acknowledge that every-
one is entitled to his opinion and that 
imposi ng one's beliefs on others is 
both rude and self-righteous, I also 
remember an insightful quote that 
challenges this notion. It says, 
"Freedom of thought does not always 
imply freedom of action." 

In other words, "You are free to 
believe whatever you want as long as 
you don't hurt others. You may 
believe that animals should be killed, 
that black people should be enslaved, 
or that women should be beaten, but 
you don't always have the right to put 
your beliefs into practice." 

Besides, is a person not doing the 
exact same thing when telling others 
they have no right to tell other peo-
ple what to do? 

I have friends who ask me, "Why 
are you a vegetarian? What difference 
does it make?" For a long time, I used 
to wonder the same myself. Only after 
researching the issue on my own did I 
rea lize how significant my actions are. 

Whatever angle you take, be it 
global or personal, expanding one's 
ethics to include the welfare of ani-
mals just makes sense. 

According to PETA, the meat 
industry causes more water pollution 

in the United States than any other 
indusoy because the animals raised for 
food produce 130 times more excre-
ment than the entire hwnan popula-
tion - 86,600 pounds per second. 

Additionally, raising animals for 
food consumes more than half of all

the water used in the United States 
- it takes 2,500 gallons of water to 
produce one pound of meat, versus 
25 gallons of water to produce one 
pound of wheat. 

One pamphlet reads, "Think you 
can be a meat-eating environmental-
ist? Think again." Many who whine 
about rainforests being desuoyed fail 
to realize that much of that land is 
destroyed to create space for animals 
to graze. In fact, 55 square feet of 
land are consumed for every quarter-
pound fast food burger made of rain-

Administration lacks assertion 
Bush's handling of tragedy leaves something to be desired 
By ED WU 
Senior Staff Writer 

In times of international crisis, it 
has become traditional for Americans 
to drop political differences and 
unwaveringly support whoever is in 
the White House at the time. 

Tuesday'S events were no excep-
tion to history'S rule. Days after the 
multiple terrorist attacks on the 
World Trade Center and the 
Pentagon, special inserts were includ-
ed in newspapers across the country 
such as the San Diego Union-Tribum 
and Washington Port: a newspaper 
page-sized American flag, on the back 
of which was printed quotes from our 
current chief executive. 

The History Channel was run-
ning a television advertisement that 
flashed vintage quotes, first from 
Lincoln's Gettysburg address, then 
Roosevelt's "Day of Infamy" speech, 
and finally, Pre'sident George W. 
Bush's speech from last Tuesday. 

The implicit message, of course, 
was that these were trying times, and 
indeed, the leaders' quotes had risen 
to the occasion with memorable 
words that inspired the nation. 

Bush, however, does not belong 
in this pantheon. His words and 
actions last Tuesday spoke more of 
fear than leadership. 

His words, spoken from his con-
cealment in the Oval Office and 
sanitized by the medium of televi-
sion cameras, seemed uncompas-
sionate and unfeeling. 

Indeed, while Bush's support lev-
els remain unalterably high due to the 
svmbolic narure of his office, he has 
riussed an opporrunity to focus efforts 
on rebuilding public confidence, 
instead taking a vague rhetorical 
route promising retribution that only 
increases the crisis atmosphere. 

What went wrong with Bush 's 
behavior? First of all, Bush's early 
response, voiced with schoolchildren 
behind him (as the Washington Post 
scoffed, "Did he think this was some 
sort of photo op?") was an inadequate 
promise to find those responsible and 
purush them. Minutes later, a plane 
went into the Pentagon. 

When one steps back from the 

events of last Tuesday, one wonders 
what Bush was doing making incf-
fecrual comments when there were 
still airliners in American skies. 
Instead of making hasty, ill-pre-
pared comments, shouldn't he have 
been assessing the siul3tion? 

About an hour later, he again 
appeared to make some hasty com-
ments, but then started flying around 
the counoy like some sort of scared 
animal, first from Florida to an air 
base in the South, then to Omaha, 
Neb., then finally back to the Capitol 
in the late afternoon once it was clear 
that the danger was past. 

Yes, the president of the United 

When one steps back 
from the events of last 
Tuesday, one wonders 
what Bush was doing 

making ineffectual 
comments when there 

were still airliners in 
American skies. Instead 

of making hasty, ill-
prepared comments, 

shouldn't he have been 
assessing the situation? 

States is a likely terrorist target. But 
under such pressure, what 
Americans need to see is a leader of 
confidence, willing to take the risk 
of attack in Washington . 

In staying away from an above-
ground target such as the White 
House until commercial air traffic 
was cleared and the building itself 
was cleared, Bush did not decisively 
rerurn to the capital city and take 
the helm of the country. 

This all seems trivial, but the 
point IS that Bush failed to show 
Americans what needed to be shown 
the most: that terrorists would not 
alter the fabric of our lives in this 
cou ntry, and indeed, would not 
make us afraid. 

Our chief executive cowering in 

hiding from action was a far cry 
from fonner British Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher's reaction dur-
ing a terrorist attack on her life and 
the lives of her cabinet members. 

Less than an hour after an Irish 
Republican Anny bomb went off in a 
hotel in Brighton, England, where 
she was staying, Thatcher appeared 
on television fully dressed and refused 
to let terrorists alter her schedule. 

Although the circumstances are 
very different - the attack in 
England was on the prime minister 
rather than on hordes of citizens -
it clearly illustrates what Bush 
lacked: a clear understanding that 
the aim of terrorists is to scare the 
populace into believing that th~r 
lives are in danger constantly and 
that their country and leaders are 
helpless to protect them. The pri" 
mary message should not have been 
retribution. The primary message 
should have been defiance. 

Bush's speech later Tuesday 
night also lacked the fire of defiance 
that Americans could have drawn 
on. While Bush had perhaps decid-
ed to resort to a minimalist effect, as 
he has done throughout his short 
presidency, in times like these the 
last thing that Americans want is a 
minimalist president. 

What Bush should have and could 
have done was to seize tlle opportuni-
ty to t.1ke the bully pulpit and acrual-
Iy lead the country - call a joint ses-
sion of Congress and stand before 
them to defiantly encourage 
Americans not only to live their lives 
out of fear, but also to rebuild. 

While retribution no doubt is a 
necessary and primary part of the 
message, defiance against terrorists 
was hardly a focus of Bush's speech. 

The closest he got was glossed-
over terms about refusing to let ter-
rorists "destroy freedom" and prac-
tical matters pertaining to the open-
ing of federal offices and stability of 
our economic system. 

There was no talk of helping to 
rebuild ew York's buildings and 
people, no words encouraging 
Americans to have faith that the air

forest beef. 
Many doctors and nutritionists 

agree that a vegetarian diet is healthier. 
For instance, Cornell University nutri-
tional biochemist T. Colin Campbell 
supervised the largest, most in-depth 
nutritional epidemiological srudy of its 
kind ever performed. He concluded, 
"We're basically a vegetarian species 
and should be eating a wide variety of 
plant foods and minimizing our intake 
of animal foods ." 

Carnivorous animals have curved 
fangs, claws and a short digestive 
tract. Humans have evolved without 
these traits. Our so-called "canine" 
teeth are minuscule in comparison. 
We have flat molars and a long diges-
tive tract that are more suited for a 
diet of vegetables, fruits and grains. 

Campbell has said also that in the 
next 10 yea rs the public will begin to 
hear that animal protein is in fact a 
toxic compound. A connection 
between cholesterol from meat con-
sumption and heart disease - does 
that sound familiar? 

Getting enough protein is a con-
cern for some, but according to 
Campbell's study and those of other 
professionals in the field , excess animal 
protein has been linked to osteoporo-
sis, kidney diseases and cancer. It has 
been shown that Americans typically 
have three to four times as much pro-
tein in their diet as is necessary. 

Finally, there is the ethical argu-
ment against animal exploitation. 
Those who are religious may argue

research is usually based on selfish 
reasons. 

Al lowing individuals - namely 
those who wish to clone dead fami ly 
members or create perfect children 
- to play with the building blocks of 
life is like letting genes run rampant. 
It's an intrusion on Mother Narure. 
It's like playing God.

that God put animals on Earth for us 
to use. "Dominion over animals" is not 
the same as tyrarUlY, however. Nothing 
in the Bible would justify our modern-
day policies and practices of destroying 
the earth, eradicating entire species of 
wild life and subjecting billions of ani-
mals each year to pain and suffering. 

What kind of suffering? For 
starters, in the lucrative chicken indus-
try, farmers lice off baby birds' beaks 
with a hot blade, sometinles removing 
part of their tongues or faces. 

At the slaughterhouse, some cows 
have their ears, udders and feet cut 
off while they are still fully conscious. 
Most dairy cows are confined their 
enti re, brief lives in narrow concrete 
stalls. 

To ensure continual lactation, 
most are constantly impregnated 
through artificial insemination and 
are immediately separ:ned from their 
calves. After only six or seven years in 
the dairy industry - less than one-
third of their possible life expectancy 
- most cows are spent and will be 
sold for low-grade beef. 

The most alarnling fact about the 
meat indusoy is its size. early 9 bil-
lion animals per year are cranmled into 
tiny cages on "factory fanns," where 
they never see the sun, breathe fresh 
air or feel grass beneath their feet, only 
to be slaughtered shortly after birth.

will take the United States to the 
forefront of medical research, is it 
acceptable to use taxpayers' dollars 
toward such research? It is complete-
ly unacceptable. 

When the nation can find no mid-
dle ground on such a topic, the polit-
ically mandated decision will cause 
socia l upheaval because it forces the 
public to put its money into some-
thing that many of its members do 
not believe is moral. I believe that to 
be an infringement on the basic liber-
ty of U.S. citizens. 

President George W. Bush has 
announced that there will indeed be 
limited federal funding for embryon-
ic stem cell research. Before this 
announcement, funding had always 
been derived from private instiru-
tions and individuals. His decision 
will give an estimated $250 million in 

federal funds for 
research on 60 lines Although wanting 

to recreate loved 
ones after tragically 
losing them is 
understandable, 
playing God is hard-
ly ethical or moral. 
Sooner or later, the 
destruction of a 
cloned human being 
may be seen as justi-
fiable to save the life 
of another human 
being. 

According to the 
Donaldson Report 
on the bioethics of

open a Pandora's 

box of tragedy, 
leading the human 

race to become

of embryonic stem 
cells, though not the 
embryos themselves. 
The lines used are 
already labeled to be 
discarded. 

The bottom line is 
that no more stem 
cells are to be extract-
ed from embryos, 
even doomed 
embryos from fertility 
clinics. This decision 
tries to find the mid-
dle ground in a debate 

stem cell research, the definition 'of 
embryonic stem cell research is the 
destruction of hwnan beings for the 
Usa-called benefit of others." 

Rea lize that not only does stem 
cell research involve deliberate cre-
ation, but also sacrifice and inten-
tional destruction. It degrades human 
life by dictating when one should live 
and when one should die, and who 
those people should be. Stem cell 
research supports a utilitarian ethic 
that aftinns that the end justifies the 
means. However, these acts diminish 
the dignity that all humans deserve. 

Those in favor of stem cell 
research must first admit that while 
this new science has great potential, 
it has not helped anyone yet. Because 
scientists are still in the stages of test-
ing animals, the projected benefits of 
stem cell research have yet to be 
affirmed. 

While it is argued that allowing 
federal funding for stem cell research 

that rea lly has nonc. 
Congress is still capable of overrid-

ing this decision, yet it is unlikely that 
it will do so. The House is staunchly 
opposed to the creation of human 
embryos for any scientific purpose. 

Whilc Bush is trying to appease 
most in the stem..cell debate, it is 
clear that he is not ready to hand over 
humanity in the face of science. His 
decision is, however, still a strong and 
clear message that the federal gov-
ernment will support this moral-
stricken science to a certain degree. 

Allowing research to proceed 
without so much as a set of regula-
tions will open a Pandora's box, lead-
ing the human race to become noth-
ing more than scientific specimens. 
The moral costs are much heavier 
that the potential benefits. 

With this in mind, we must heed 
the words of Pope John Paul II : 
"Man must be the master and the 
defender of the human race, and not 
the product of his technology."

Research needs govern-

Continued from pace A4 
which has opened the door to conta-
mination from viruses that these cells 
might carry. The possibility of conta-
mination makes the existing cell lines 
unfit for use in human experimenta-
tion, thus negating a large part of the 
potential benefit that could have 
come from this group of cell lines. 

The reasons for a wider approval of 
stem cell lines in research are numer-
ous and self-apparent. Removing the 
current limitations that hem in the size 
of the stock of cell lines would allow 
the use of embryonic cells that acrual-
Iy have the potential to be of some use

health advancement that stem cell 
research promises are staggering. 
Stem cells are the most versatile in

There are too many 
students who are 

unaware of what the 
Stuart Collection is. No 

wonder many people ' 
seem to be confused 

by the presence of 
stone haystacks and 
talking metal trees. 

Stuart Collection: the snake path 
going to Geisel Library, the neon 
lights in Warren College displaying 
the seven vices and virtues, and, of 
course, the Sun God. It's hard to go 
anywhere on campus without being 
immersed in something weird and 
creative.

we can," he said. 

The argument tbat vegetarianism 
is a personal choice that shou Id not 
be forced upon others seems to be 
va lid. However, our society also 
argues that from a moral standpoint, 
actions that haml others are not mat-
ters of personal choice. Few would 
argue today that slavery or child 
labor is not immoral. However, his-
tory has taught us that society 
encouraged practices at one time that 
are now widely accepted as wrong. 

I once heard that legality is no 
guarantee for morality. Animal rights 
is no different, and just because it is 
legal to abuse and exploit animals, 
usually with the public completely 
unaware of it, does not make it right. 

All refonn movements have initial-

people to rerum to work and school, 
but instead perperuated the air of crisis 
by emphasizing that the military was 
o.n alert to guarantee our security. 

What the administration failed to 
realize is that terrorism is not a war 
against our military forces. This has 
been a blindside of this young admin-
istration already - domestic policy is 
shaped by tnternational rhetoric, a 
mingling that tries to drag the usual 
solidarity of American overseas 
rhetoric back home to support 
domestic aims. 

Indeed, while most of Bush's focus 
had first been on victims, it then 
turned to war and military Fngage-

who feel that they have been unable to 
produce the desired results within the 
constraints of the American system. 
Unless the Bush administration gives a 
more firm nod to stem cell research, it 
is likely that other countries will 
evenrually be host to a plethora of 
expatriate American scientists. 

Under the current restrictions, 
American experimental progress on 
this technology will likely lag behind 
that of other countries, and indeed, 
behind private industry researchers 
whose companies will be able to 
patent and restrict the technological 
breakthroughs they achieve. 

Misuse of this technology is cer-
tainly a threat, which any proponent 
of stem cell research will admit. That 
is where conscientious and scientifi-
cally minded legislation comes into 
play: If properly legislated, many of 
the doubts and fears regarding the 
potential for this technology to get 
out of hand will be alleviated. 

We cannot ;xpect stem cell 
research to develop ethically without 
the assistance of government, which 
ought to be the most vocal proponent 
of a technology that has the potential 
to help so many. The Bush adminis-
tration ought not to stymie this 
potential any longer. 

UCSD in general seems to be really 
quirk)' and interesting, and always 
worth more than just one look. 

Turn on Channel 18 (UCSD-TV) 
and you can see ballet dancers per-
fonning dexterously to The Prodigy's 
"Smack My Bitch Up." Go to a free 
"New Music Forum" and ),ou can see 
someone playing the radio as a musi-
cal instrument. 

So next time you see something 
out-of-the-o.rdinary on campus such as 
a giant red shoe or a big ugly haystack, 
take some time to think and absorb 
what you see. You may find something 
really special that will enrich your 
UCSD lifestyle. Then again, you also 
might find yourself in front of the Sun 
God wondering what the heck the uni-
versity was thinking. I guess not every-
thing can be understood.

COLLEGIATE CONNECTION I _________________ ~ 
U. Colorado proposal for domestic partner benefits fails 

BOULDER, Colo. - The 
University of Colorado Board of 
Regents narrowly defeated a propos-
al Sept. 6 that would have extended 
employee health benefits to domestic 
partners. 

With four voting in favor of the 
proposal and four voting against it, 
the board's chairwoman, Maureen 
Ediger - who was undecided the day 
of the meeting - had the power to 
break the tie but chose not to, effec-
tively killing the measure. 

"This has been a difficult issue," 
said Ediger, who was near tears as she 
announced her decision. 

She offered no explanation prior 
to the vote but issued a written state-
ment. 

"I don't feel that the justification 
currently exists for me, a public 
trustee of state monies, to make the 
'fifth vote' in favor of extension of 
domestic parmer benefits," Ediger's 
statement read. "The Board of 
Regents is obviously split and I can't 
justify passing a measure that would 
only furthcr divide the board." 

At the same time, Ediger said 

she could not justify an outright 
"no" vote because it would give the 
impression that she does not sup-
port the rights of homosexual 
employees. 

"I want to be clear that I do not 
agree with those who have lobbied 
me to vote 'no' based on a moral 
judgment of these employees' 
lifestyles," Ediger said. 

Speaking with reporters, Ediger 
said she could not verify claims that 
the lack of domestic-partner benefits 
was hurting the university'S efforts to 
recruit and retain faculty and staff. 

"I could not get a good answer to 
that question," she said. 

Regent Susan Kirk said that con-
trary to Ediger's assertion, there is 
"compelling evidence" that domes-
tic-parmer benefits make a difference 
in recruiting. 

But Uriel Nauenberg, chairman 
of the Boulder Faculty Assembly, said 
that was not the point. The point, 
according to Nauenberg, was one of 
principle. 

The governing bodies of the uni-
versity'S faculty, staff and students 

strongly supported the domestic-
partnership measure. 

"I am extremely disappointed," 
Nauenberg said. "Now, I have to go 
tell the facu lty." 

Regent Bob Sievers was in tears as 
he spoke before the vote. 

"In my years on the board, there's 
been no issue that's been more divi-
sive," Sievers said. "This is a struggle 
that will go on." 

Regent Jim Martin said he sup-
ported the proposal because he 
believes everyone has a "fundamental 
right" to health care. 

"It's not a vote on the sanctity of 
the family or of ITIlrriage, and it's cer-
tainly not a vote on morality," Martin 
said. "This is an issue about health 
care." 

Opponents of the measure cited 
concerns about using taxpayer money 
to provide such benefits. It has been 
estimated that 300 to 600 people 
would seek domestic-partner bene-
fits, costing the university from 
$250,000 to $500,000 annually. 

Ediger and Sievers now want to 
find other ways to address the issue 

MTV's 'Real World' star returns to Utah 
PROVO, Utah - Julie Stoffer is 

back in Provo, Utah, and she's head-
ed for the big screen. 

The former Brigham Young 
University student was widely 
known for her role on Mn"s "The 
Real World." 

Stoffer makes a cameo appear-
ance in "Singles Ward," a comedy 
about dating and slllgie life in 
,\'Iormon church. 

The film's producer, David 
Hunter, chose Stoffer because "she 
was a person who stuck out in 
i\ lormons' minds." 

" I think people will be interestcd 
because it's her first time back in 
Utah, and she got kicked out of 
BYU," Hunter said. "We just 
thought, you know, it'll be interest-
ing to have her on board, see what 
she does." 

In the film , Stoffer plays a 
temptress who tries to seduce the 
film's leading single man . 

Since "The Real World," Stoffer 
has been living in Huntington 
Beach, Calif. 

She said she doesn't think she's a 
celebrity but does get an occasional 

"There goes 'the Monnon chick."' 
"I tried not to make my religion a 

real critical part of the show. But how 
could it not be? I'm Monnon, it's a 
big part of my life," Stoffer said. . 

Stoffer has no awkward feelings 
about being back in Utah. 

'I tried not to make my 
religion a real critical 
part of the show, But 
how could it not be?'

Former "Real World" 

cast member 

"I love bem g here. I was on cam-
era when all the controversy was 
gomg on. I found out about being 
kicked out of school from a 
reporter," she said. 

Still, Stoffer said she has no 
regrets. 

"I would do it all over again, ten-
fold. I had such a fun experience. I 
don't love the way the show was 

edited, but I have no (:ontrol over 
that," she said. 

However, some BYU students 
said they think it's in poor taste for 
Stoffer to receive more acclaim. 

"I don't really see there being a 
need to reward her. I think she 
behaved very poorly. I'm absolutely 
embarrassed," said senior Sarah 
Stratford, a recreational youth man-
agement major at BYU. 

For now, Stoffer is focusing on 
her film work, and her fellow cast 
and crew mates support her. 

"I can't say anything becausc I 
don 't want to be hypocritical," said 
producer David Hunter. 

Other famous members of the 
Mormon church who appear in the 
film include former BA great 
Danny Ainge, TV and film star 
Gordon Jump from "WKRP In 
Cincinnati," and baseball star Wally 
Joyner. 

The film is due out in January 
2002 and will be released regionally 
and then nationally on video.

- possibly by raising private money 
to pay for domestic-parmer benefits. 

Ediger said she will raise the issue 
again before her term expires in 
January 2003 . She has announced 
that she will not seek re-election. 

Regent Tom Lucero, who voted 
against the measure, found himself 
at the center of controversy after 
newspapers reported in the last 
week of August that he wrote a let-
ter opposing domestic-partner ben-
efits on behalf of the Christian 
Coalition . 

The letter, mailed to coalition 
members, described proponents of 
the measure as "extreme homosexu-
al-agenda leaders" who want to 
"force me and my colleagues to use 
your tax dollars to pay for special 
benefits to gay, lesbian, bisexual and 
transsexual partners." 

Lucero said at the meeting that, 
while he was planning to vote against 
the measure, he did not consider 
himself intolerant. 

"My father was murdered," 
Lucero said, "because of the color of 
his skin ." 

Lucero and his family are Latino. 
"I've been around gay men and 

gay women my whole life, and I've 
been raised in a household of toler-
ance," Lucero said. 

Regent Gail Schwartz described 
domestic-partner benefits as good 
policy. noting that many other insti-
tutions and private companies, 
including the Coors Brewing Co., 
offer them. 

"In the 21 st century. it's good 
business for the University of 
Colorado," she said. "It's a very 
minor investment ... but it would 
serve us to provide an environment 
that is open." 

Kirk agreed, saying, "This is a 
resolution that embodies not only 
good public policy, but it's the right 
thing to do." 

The four regents who voted 
against the measure were Lucero, 
Peter Steinhauer. Norwood Robb 
and Jerry Rutledge. Regents Sievers, 
Kirk, Schwartz and Martin supported 
the proposal.

U. Northern Colorado presi-
dent once target of bin Laden 

GREELEY, Colo. - University of 
Northern Colorado president Hank 
Brown knows what it means to be the 
target of terrorism. 

Brown served as chairman of the 
Middle East subcommittee during 
his time in Congress. As a senator, he 
ran afoul of terrorist leader Osama 
bin Laden, the man authorities think 
may be behind Tuesday's suicide-
bombing attacks. 

"I spent a lot of time working on a 
peace settlenlent in Afghanistan when 
I was in the Senatc," Brown said. "I 
don't think he liked me that much." 
. In the early 1990s, bin Laden put a 
$1 million pricetag on Brown's head. 

"It was pretty close to the amount 
of money that I'd have done it myself," 
Brown said, laughing off the threat. 
"But it wasn't enough." 

Brown said he thinks the United 
States needs to take a harder line 
with terrorism. 

"The missing link here on dealing 
with terrorism has never been intelli-
gence," he said. "The missing link has 
been our willingness to act on it." 

Brown said he thinks this is the 
problem with bin Laden. 

"We failed to go after him," he 
said. "To some extent, the fact that this 
happened is the product of our neglect 
to take it seriously." 

Brown has a prescription for the 
problem. 

"First, a c1C"Jr policy is needed," he 
said. "My hope is that they will make it 
clear that state-sponsored terrortSm is 
nOt acceptable and that people who 
engage in it will be eliminated." 

Brown said he thinks the country 
should attack terrorist leaders directly. 

"I think it is essential that we havc 
the ability to eliminate terrorist lead-
ers," he said. 

Brown said he favors the current 
rules of engagement that prevent the 
United States from targeting leaders. 

"I think the key to aU of this is that 
we, as a country, have to detennine 
that we are not going to allow this any-
more," he said.

allowed to move in early if they

took advanrage of this and joined

"I wanted to help out freshmen

"It's al 0 a great way to meet peo-

Older students sympathized with

one reason Guarantee was selected 
was because it was a "known entity." 

She claimed that the plan's cov-

health insurance providers, while

Students were automatically

who can prove that they already 
have sufficient health insurance can 
waive the fee via Studentlink. The

Enforcement of 
alcohol increased 
Local coalition addresses 
excessive collegiate drinking 
By GEOFF DIETRICH 
Associate Nt;ws Editor 

Efforts to prevent collegiate alco-
hol abuse in an Diego were 
Strengthened this summer with help 
from the Community-Collegiate 
Alcohol Prevention Partnership. 

C-CAPP is a coalition of local 
universities, law enforcement agen-
cies and commulllty organization. 
whose goal is to reduce alcohol-relat-
ed incidents. 

It repon ed success and planned 
future goals dunng Its quarterly 
meeting Friday. 

"Our campuses may be diffe rent 
but we all have the same problem," 
sa id Marian Novak, C-CAPP's pro-
ject coordmator. 

Police have recently increased 
their alcohol enforcement m the col-
lege and beach areas, according to 
Lieutenant Michael Cash of the San 
Diego police. The result has been 
fewer reported physical and seA'Ual 
assaults, as well as less public drunk-
enness in the area. 

"Residents have been hJppy -
even the students - which I was real 
surprised," Cash said . "They felt 
safer. It has been a huge success as far 
as keeping people safe." 

Responding to unlawful parties in 
college areas is one of C-CAPP's 
main functions. In the past year, 
there were over 1,300 responses to 
parties in the beach area. Of those, 
45 houses were 'capped,' meaning 
that if the police responded lO an 
address more than once a year, the 
owner was cited and fined. 

Noise complaints trigger a 
response by the C-CAPP team, 
which often uses undercover party-
goers to detect underage drinkers, 
kegs and drugs. 

Doug Miller of the SDSU police 
reported excellent progress in effortS 
of keeping alcohol out of the hands 
of minors, but he added that it takes 
six to seven years to measure the pro-
gram's true effectiveness. 

"If you raise the perception of the 
risk, the risk-taking goes down," 
Miller said. "We are doing all kinds 
of things that un iversities and police 
don't normally do. It is true commu-
nity policing." 

Policing is ju t one aspect of the 
integrated C-CAPP approach . 

Taxi: 
Service provides safe

Continued from page Al 
dents of UCSD." 

The Gaslamp, because of its large 
bar culture, tends to be a destination 
of the 21 and up crowd. The area 
host!! annual events like Mardi Gras 
and Street Scene, which occurred 
Sept. 7 to 9 this year. It is famous .for 
bars like Ole Madrid, Off Broadway 
and The Onyx Room. 

"Expanding Triton Taxi into the 
downtown area increases its appeal 
and accessibility to older, off-campus 
and commuting students," said A.S. 
President Jeff Dodge. 

The Triton Taxi program was 
founded in 1999 to provide students 
a way to avoid unsafe situations, such 
as walking home alone, car trouble, 
parties, dates and particularly drunk 
driving. 

"Triton Taxi was founded in order 
to give students a safe way to get 
home and escape any uncomfortable 
situation," said Triton Taxi founder 
and former A.S. Commissioner of 
Services and Enterprises Matt 
Conroy. "In addition to increasing 
student safety, this program serves 
the community by tran porting stu-
denb who 1111ghl othcrnlse dn\'c 

h(lm~ mtl)\:JCat~d ., 

Working with community organiza-
tions is integral. 

"Law enforcement cannot arrest 
our way OUl of these problems," said 
Richard McGaffigan of the Institute 
for Public Strategies. "It is a commu-
nity program, nOl a law enforcement 
program."

"It IS Just anOlher wa\, to attack the 
problem of alcohol ," 5;{ld Ray (,ros>

Drivers Association of an Diego. 
"There are a lot of aCCidents . . . 
mvolving dnnking and drugs."

lar bars such as Martini Ranch, 
Pacific Beach Bar and Grill and the 
Bitter End to get drunken patrons 
and their cars hOllle safely. 

AdminiStrators of local college 
playa critical role in the program. It 
is ultimately their responsibility to 
inform students about the dangers of 
alcohol and drugs and the services 
available. 

All local colleges are involvcd in 
the effort. California State 
University San Marcos is appealing 
the liquor license awarded to the 
Ralphs supermarket across from 
futurc dorms. 

aney While and hannon 
Chamberlin, both of the Student 
Safety Awareness Program, repre-
sented UCSD 3t the meeting. 
According to Chamberlin, 3ntl-
drinking programs are not the focus 
of tlle SSAP. Rather, it works with 
Psychological Services and Student 
Health Services to prevent physica l 
and sexual viol",nce committed by 
UCSD students. 

Chamberlin added that most of 
UCSD's alcohol education programs 
are geared toward freshmen, so pro-
grams like C-CAPP are integral in 
educating college tudents once they 
turn 21 and make the transition from 
the apartlnent party culture to a 
more bar-oriented culture. 

"It's a really great way to share 
ideas and stay involved with what IS 
going on in the communi ty," 
Chamberlin said . 

Triton Taxi's operatin g hours 
remai n the same: Friday and 
Saturday nights, II p.m. to 3 a.m . 

Parent sa id A.S. Counci l is look-
ing into expanding service times as 
well. 

"One of the possibilities of 
expanding service to the border 
would include expanding it to 
include Wednesday night service as 
well ," Parent said. "However, such 
an expansion would cost more 
money. We would have to find addi-
tional funding for the program. That 
funding could come from the Senate 
or from outside sponsors." 

The focus rem~ins on expanding 
the service area. 

"Right now hours are less of a pri-
ority than area or service, but that's 
only because of what the demand has 
been," Par.ent said. "In a perfect world, 
we'd expand both. It really depends on 
what funds are available and how 
much of a priority this program is in 
the minds of the A.S. Senate." 

All UCSD undergraduates can 
use Triton Taxi. They must, however, 
sign a waiver stating that they under-
stand their responsibilities for using 
the service and put an orange Triton 
Taxi stic!c.er on their UCSD ID cards.

By GEOFF DIETRICH 
Associate News Editor 

Thousands of families and 
friends may have gotten more than 
they bargained for June 17 when 
they joined UCSD graduates at 
RlMAC Field to celebrate AII-
Campus Commence nent. 

Dr. Hunter "Patch" Adams, 
keynote speaker at the event, closed 
the ceremony by mooning the 
crowd, and was joined by former 
A.S. President Doc Khaleghi. 

The events evoked a formal 
apology from Vice Chancellor of 
Student ffairs Joseph Watson. 

The concluding gesture drew a 
mixed response, however, as many 
in the audience laughed, some 
applauded and others seemed to 
reCOil in disapproval. 

"I didn't appreciate it at all," 
graduate Dan Armstrong said. 
Armstrong's mother Laura con-
curred: "I am really disappointed -
this was supposed to be positive." 

In addition to his posterior-
bearing finale, some attendees said 
the content of Adams' speech left 
them with a bad taste in their 
mouth. 

For the Armstrongs, Adams' 
remarks may have dampened an 
otherwise joyous day, but many 
were moved by his speech and 
appreciated the concluding anllcs. 

"It was fantastic; the most mov-
ing speech [I've heardJ in the last 30 
years," said Dan Daigle, father of a 
graduate. "I think the man's mes-
sage gives us something to think 
about." 

Warren graduate Jamie Kunze 
also was impressed by the speech, 

but for another rea on: "I enjoyed 
watching the faculty [members'J 
expressions. " 

Kunze's father Chris found few 
faults with the address, as well. 

"It makes you want to drop 
everything and change your life," 
he aid. "In terms of giving and 
sharing wealth, it's a good message 
to think about on their way out into 
the world." 

Others doubted that the speech 
was understandable 

mencement speech ever, filled with 
what he referred to as "seditiou 
ideas." 

Adams then turned his speech to 
challenging, introspective ques-
tions, encouraging graduates to 
consider how they could save their 
futures by bringing true meaning 
back into their lives. 

"Is there any chance that care 
could be commonplace and not rev-
olutionary? Can one call it living if 

one is silent 
to the majority of 
the attendees. 

"It was definitely 
conuoversiaI and a 
little political," said 
Muir graduate Sarah 
Fabes. "A little 
extreme to reach 
anyone." 

'What buttons 
need to be pushed 

to have a person 
change from 

defining success in 
terms of a lust for 
money and power 

toward defining 
success as lovi ng 

rad iant care?' 

about injustice? 
What buttons 
need to be 
pushed to have a 
person change 
from defining 
success in terms 
of a lust for 
money and 
power toward 
defining success 
as loving radiant 
care," Adams 
asked. 

On speaking 

In response to 
such criticism, 
Adams replied, "I 
never care if I stimu-
late or irritate. I 
came as a doctor and 
I say we are going to 
be extinct." 

-Hunter 'Patch' Adams about the social 
problems that 

Watson 's apolo- Graduation speaker . face the graduat-
. gy regarding the 

antics stated that "It was unfortu-
nate, and we apologize to students 
and guests who were offended by 
this gesture." 

Aside from the mooning, Adams 
urgently encouraged graduates to 
take back the public sphere from a 
"lust of money" and uansform it to 
"one of a love for humanity." 

He also thanked the students 
for personally inviting him to 
speak and assured that he would be 
issuing his "most personal" com-

ing class, Adams 
alluded to urgency in raising the 
issues. 

"I am now not letting myself not 
give a talk when I don't bring it up," 
he said. "I feel it is irresponsible 
[not toJ .... 1 am compelled to do 
this." 

Adams also touched on national 
politics, arguing that President 
George W. Bush was contributing 
to "the dire state of life." 

"There has never been a more 
dangerous man in America for my

lifetime - this is an embarrassment 
to leadership," Adams said to 
applause. "I can guarantee that 
unless you are rich he doesn't C"Jre 
about you and never will - ever. 
He is not smart enough to know he 
is completely devoid of compas-
sion." 

Following the ceremony, Adams 
mingled with those who wanted pic-
tures and autographs, and he was 
infrequently berated" by members of 
the audience for his attacks on Bush. 

Adams' speech was preceded by 
Chancellor Robert C. Dynes' wel-
coming address, in which he too 
emphasized the importance of giv-
ing back to ociety as opposed to 
just helping oneself. 

"Use your education for the 
betterment of society," Dynes said. 
"I wish you all the best in your 
future endeavors. Go out and make 
us proud." 

Khaleghi also preceded Adams 
in addressing the graduating class; 
he encouraged the audience to take 
personal responsibility for the 
future of the world. 

"You need to seek responsibility 
and seek it zealous I}'," Khaleghi 
said. "Make your responsibility to 
be the change you want to see in the 
world. And then outside the ideal-
ized and protected confines of this 
university you will find a sanctuary 
within yourself." 

Khaleghi also warned of a future 
in which humans would be extinct 
as a result of a dearth of priorities, 
but he assured that hope was alive: 
"There is still a chance we can still 
turn it around. This is a call for 
heroism. If we are to prevail , it will 
be your generation."

Continued from page 27 
the econd overtime for a 1-0 victory. 

With time running out, UCSD 
thwarted a Bronco attack in its terri -
tory and raced the ball upfielc.l. Jones 
kicked a perfect cross pass over the 
head of Pomona goalie Katie Kreps 
and Miklos left the ground to head 
the ball into the net for the victory. 

Kreps, after posting three consec-
utive shutouts in her first three 
games this year, was denied her 
fourth as time. expired just after 
Miklos' goal. Miklos' heroics in the 
game earned her honorable mention 
for CCM Women's occer Player of 
the Week for the wet:k of Sept. 4 
through Sept. 9. 

Broncos Michelle McConell and 
Tia Rudolph were influential in help-
ing Cal Poly control the ball for most 
of the game. Rudolph just missed 
scoring in the first half when her shot 
hit the crossbar. 

Poma, the Triton goalie, was 
instrumental in keeping UCSD in 
the game while the Broncos outshot 
UCSD 15-5. She recorded three 
saves on the day. This was the fourth 
straight victory for the Tritons over 
the Broncos in the pa t two years, 
however three of those wins have 
been in overtime. 

In their next game on Sept. 12, 
the Tritons easily bounced back from 
their toughest game of the year and 
overcame Grand Canyon Universi[}' 
by a tinal of 5-0. It was their third 5-
o victory in their first five games. 

Miklos again led the team, this 
time with two goals, while Hughes, 
Richards and Cordova each con-
tri bu ted a goa 1. 

The league-leading UCSD 
offense gave Antelope goa lkeeper 
Jolene Gagnon a headache all game, 
outshooting Grand Canyon t 9-1. 

The Tritons' game, which origi-
nally had been scheduted for Sept. 
t I, was moved back a day due to the 
unfortunate events that occurred 
Tuesday. 

The team was forced to make a 
straight drive from Phoenix to San 
Francisco where the road-weary 
Tritons were stunned by the surpris-
ing San Francisco State Gator, 1-0 
last Saturday. The t 8th ranked 
Gators, picked to finish last in their 
division in a preseason poll , have 
proved all critics wrong on the way to 
a 4-0-1 record and the best start in 
school history. 

Junio'r Gator goalie Kelly Hoover 
made eight saves to shut out the 
Triton offense that had averaged 4.3 
goals per game over their first five 
games, and junior Roberta Morrow 
led the Gator defense that contained 
the Tritons. 

On the other side of the field , 
senior Christina Quintero (second 
team All-Far West Region in 2000) 
provided all the offense San 
Francisco State needed 5:44 into the 
game when she scored off of her own 
rebound. 

The Tritons outshot San 
Francisco State 24-9 and had attacks 
from II different players, yet were 
unable to get the ball past Hoover, 
who made several spectacular saves. 

The Tritons' loss drops them to 
5-1 on the season and ends their 22 
game winning streak, while the 
Gators remain undefeated on the 
season. 

Aher the game the Tritons hit 
the road again ~nd headed farther 
north to do battle with Sonoma 
State. They then will finally end 
their extended road trip and head 
home to take . on California State 
University Dominguez Hills next 
Friday at 4:30 p.m. for their home 
CCMopener. 

The Toros will look to provide 
some sti ff opposition to the Tntons 
this year as CSU Dominguez I-lills 
enters this week's play with a unde-
feated 7-0-1 record, and accounted for 
one of the Tritons' two losses last year. 

Due to their unforeseen change in 
schedule, the Triton coaches and 
players were unavailable for com-
ments.

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 18,2001 

Stoner: 
Sports can constitute part of 
the healing process 
Continued from pep Al7 
unfair to have the Chargers play an 
extra game, and some son of compen-
sation would have to be made in the 
standings. The one lost game would 
also t1l3ke it very difficult for any play-
ers or teams to challenge existing 
records. What if Jevon Kearse missed 
the quanerback sack record by one 
sack? Would there have to be more 
asterisks in the record books? 

If the league officials decided to 
move this week to the end of the sea-
son, it would replace the first week of 
wild-card playoffs. This would 
reduce the number of wild-card 

. teams in each conference from three 
to one and the total number of play-
off teams from 12 to eight. This 
option would deny four teams a benh 
in the postseason - four teams that 
deserved to go to the playoffs. 

Many coaches cited the poor 
decision the NFL made in 1963 
when NFL commissioner Pete 
Rozelle elected to play only two days 
after President Kennedy's assassina-

. tion. He later called it the worst deci-
sion he made during his 29 years as 
commissioner. However, this situa-
tion is different in that if football 
resumed last Sunday, it would have 
been five days after the Pentagon and 
World Trade Center incidents. 

Five days is plenty of time to give 
respect to all those who were affected 
by the terrorist incidents, any more 
time might become dangerou , The 
American public has latched onto this 
incident, and it seems as if the public 
cannot let it go even ifit wanted to. Yet 
there comes a point when il's time to 
move on and accept the tragedy and its 
consequences upon each individual. 

Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig 
has maintained that the games missed 
will be made up at a later date. While 
th.i is the right thing to do, it will cre-
ate a scheduling nighunare. Also, per-
haps for the first time ever, the October 
Classic may turn into the ovember 
Classic. And the more games he po t-
pones, the longer the World Series gets 
pushed back, and the more the sporring 
world delineates from its nonnally 
comforting straight road. 

Five weeks after Pearl Harbor, 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt wrote a 
letter to baseball commissioner 
Kennesaw Mountain Landis and told 
him that he believed it was for the 
best if baseball continued to play. I 
believe that should hold true for this 
siruation as well. 

This leads me to my other reason . 
Spons comfon people. Sports offer 
people an e cape from reality, a shin-
ing example of honesty and fairness 
in a world and culture that rarely 
upholds those values. Rules are made 
and followed, and those who break 
them are punished. It's so simple, yet 
so captivating for millions of people 
who know that on any given day their 
team has an excellent chance of win-
ning, and whether it wins or loses, it 
will have been a fair contest. 

The idea of sports is lilce an old, 
comforting blanket you always keep 
around just to know you have it. You 
know they will always be there on the 
weekend when you want to escape 
from a hectic week. When you have 
nothing to do, there's always the option 
of taking a jog, shooting some hoops or 
going to see a ball game. Spon is the 
great equalizer, accomplishing what 
even this great society has yet to do: It 
igno(es the superficial differences and 
focuses on abililty and effun. 

If the g2mes weren't suspended, 
they would give people a chance to 
turn their eyes away from the horrif-
ic images on television all day, to 
finally not have to look at all four 
angles of the plane crashing into the 
World -Trade Center or the people 
jumping out of the burning building 
and falling to their deaths. Instead, 
America, and especially its children, 
could see more wholesome images of 
good, clean competition. 

This is not to say vie should forget 
what occum:d on Tuesday, Sept. II , 
but rather we shouldn't dwell on it. 
We: must begin to heal the American 
consciousness.

Volleyball: 
Freshman contributions key 
to team's success 
continued from page Al7 

T he Tritons, off to a 7-2 record 
this yea r, are ranked 22 nd in the 
nation in the latest American 
Volleyba ll Coaches Association 
Division II poll. 

"It 's a good start so far and we've 
played a couple strong teams," 
McFarland said. "Being a young 
team, I feel we still have a lot of 
improving to do. We're not passing 
very well. We also still need to get 
used to playing 30 minutes instead 
of 15 minutes and knowing how the 
now of the game goes and when to 
use timeouts." 

However. McFarland feels that 
the team's tough schedule so far has 
been advantageous and helped the 
athletes prepare fo r tougher oppo-
nents. 

"We'll definitely be tested," he 
aid. "But one of our greatest 

strengths is our depth." 
UCSD started its season by 

hostin g the UC San Diego 
Invitational Aug. 24 and Aug. 25 . 
Participating teams in the tourna-
Inent Included CS ' San 
Bernardino. Regis University, 
,\I1etro State UllIversity, Western 
Oregon University, C U Lo 
Angeles, Lock Haven and CS U 
Dominguez Hills. 

UCSD began the tournament 
strongly, beating Western Oregon 
and Lock Haven in straight sets. 
But after beating Metro State the 
next day, three sets to one, the 
Tritons were defeated by Regis 
University in straight se ts and 
ended up placing third in the tour-
nament. 

CS San Bernardino won the 
tournament with a 4-0 record. That 
team's Amy Pope was named tour-
nament MVP. 

The Tritons were led by senior 
Lau ra anterre, who had 49 kills, 
and ophomore Diana Camarillo. 
who racked up 36 kills. Junior Jennie 
Wilson and Santerre were amOl)g 
the tournament's best in hitting per-
centage, third and fourth, respec-
tively. Ohta averaged I3 .5 assists per 
game. Hogan also averaged the most 
blocks per game, wi th a 1.43 aver-
age. 

Santerre, Camarillo and senior 
Kathleen Hentz were named to the 
all-tournament team. Santerre also ' 
ea rned honorable mention for 
CCAA Women Volleyball Player of 
the Week. 

T hree days later, UCSD traveled 
to El Cajon and bea t Christian 
Heritage College in straight sets 30-
28, 30-20, 30-26. The Tritons 
boosted their record to 4-1 . 

It was Christian Heritage's first 
loss of the year. Santerre again led 
the Tntons With nine kills while 
sophomore Ashley Peterson and 
Hentz added six kills each for 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

UCSD. 
McFarland approved of his 

team's performance in the invita-
tional. 

"I was very happy; it was a strong 
tournament," he said. "IRegis 
University and Metro State 
University] are perennial power-
houses in Division II. Metro had a 
couple of very good Brazilian play-
ers." 

UCS D hosted Point Loma 
Nazarene University on Aug. 29 
and fell to the Crusaders in straight 
sets 30-26, 30-22, 30-27 . Point 
Loma, ranked No.2 in the NAIA 
preseason poll , was led by sopho-
more Renata Ferrer and junior 
Jamie Robinson with 14 kills each. 
The Tritons were led by Santerre, 
who finished with II kills and 10 
digs, while outside hitter 
Dunsmore collected six kills and 
five digs. 

The Tritons bounced back Sept. 
5 to bea t Alliant International 
University in three sets 30-17, 30-
18, 30-20. The loss dropped AlU to 
2-5 and boosted UCSD to 5-2. 

The Tritons traveled north 
Sept. 7 to take on Sonoma State 
University in the year's first league 
match. Playing on the Cossacks' 
brand-new noor and in front of 
452 fans, the Tritons won a gruel-
ing victory over Sonol11a State. 
The two-hour marathon match 
went to four sets, and while 
Sonoma Sta te led as late as 28-27 
in the fourth match, the Tritons 

came back to nab the win 30-16, 
30-23,20-30, 33-31. 

The Cossacks, who fell to 9-2 
with the loss, were kept in the game 
by senior Kristen Graham, who 
ended with 15 kills and six blocks, 
and sophomore Christine Shiba, 
who posted 14 kills and 17 digs. 
Dunsmore led the Tritons with 18 
kills while Peterson and Santerre 
had double-doubles. 

The next day, the Tritons 
stopped in San Francisco and easily 
disposed of San Francisco State 
University 30-18, 30-16, 30-19. The 
Gators were held to a .093 hitting 
percentage and were led by 
Courtney Heil, who had a game-
high 12 kills. Peterson had a team-
high 10 kills for the Tritons, and 
Ohta dished out 24 assists. 

The Tritons are now 7- 1 overall 
and 2 -0 in league. The hapless 
Cators lost their II th straight game 
and sti ll are seeking their first victo-
ry of the season. 

The Tritons were scheduled to 
open at home against Bakersfield on 
Sept. 14, but due to the Sept. II ter-
rorist attacks, that game and 
Saturday'S game against CSU 
Stanislaus have been postponed. 

"We are very much in support of 
the decision of Earl Edwards," 
McFarland said. "It 's way too soon 
to resume. It was such a tough week 
for everyone. IThe team] had talked 
and decided to keep practicing, but 
to play in the same week isn't 
right."

X-country: 
UC Davis, Chico wm provide 
stiff competition 
Continued from pap Al6 
spective. 

"Last year we had a very young 
team," Martin said. "More experi-
ence and strength training over the 
summer Ihas made the difference this 
year] . We increased the volume and 
intensity since we're a little strooger 
this year." 

However, despite their depth, the 
men 's cross country team is still look-
ing for freshmen to contribute to the 
team. 

"First-year [runners] can be defi -
nite impact runners," Van Arsdale 
said. "We have very talented guys. 
We'll see changes as we go along in 
our competitive ~quad ." 

Freshmen Luke Sigmon and Tov 
Fisher-Kirshner have been particu-
larly impressive so far this season, 
with Sigmon placing 66th out of 132 
runners in the UC Irvine Invitational 
and sixth out of 30 runners in the vic-
tory over Point Loma. Fisher-
Kirshner finished 89th in the UC 
Irvine Invitational. 

Both the men's and women's 
teams expect to see stiff competition 
in UC Davis and Chico State, twO 
traditional cross country powerhous-
es. 

"UC Davis has proven to be the 
top Imen's] team the last couple of 
yea rs," Van Arsdale said. "But thi 
year they were just beat by Chico." 

Martin agrees that Chico tate 
and UC Davis will be tough. 

"]They] are the only teams that 
can give us a run for our money -
especia lly Chico this year," he sa id. 
"IBut] we have the advantage of 
home course [for the CCAA champi-
onship] this year." 

Both Van Arsdale and Martin are 
happy with the men's performances 
~o far. J 

"\Ve have a really good aerobic 
ba e," Martin said . "Everyone has 
goals and dreams and ambitions, as 
well as a more positive attitude." 

"I Both the men and women] 
placed extremely well , !,riven their 
amount of experience," Van Arsdale 
said. "Those are big scholarship pro-
grams lin the UC Irvine Invitational] . 
We attl!l:ked the course extremely 
well as individuals as well as a team." 

Still, Martin and Van Arsdale say 
there is room for improvement. 

"[I think we need to work on] 
closing gaps between runners, specif-
ically the second and third runners, 
as well as running as a pack," Martin 
said. 

Van Arsdale also sees room for 
even more improvement. 

"Will they do better in a few 
weeks? Yeah," he said.

Edwards: 
Move to D-II attracts student 
athletes to La Jolla campus 
Continued from page Al7 

with the Tritons' solid performances 
in the past few years, have gone a 
long way to change that mindset 
and attract more prospective ath-
letes to this campus. 

"I would say that without ques-
tion, the move to Division II has 
helped us to attract more athletes," 
Edwards said. "I would consider 
UCSD a public Ivy league campus, 
but III the past, we have lost athlete 
to Ivy League schools simply 
because they have reputations of 
having strong athletic programs. 

ow that we have made thiS move, 
we are gelting more of those tu-
dents. 

"We are plaYll1g in one of the 
toughest Division II conferences in 
the nation, which is attractive to 
athletes," Edwards said. 

Another reason that UC D is 
attracting lUore recruits are the out-
standing athletic facilities that are 
available on this campus. 

With such phenomenal sporting 
vemles as RIMAC Arena, Triton 
Soccer Stadium and Torrey Pines 
Golf Course, UCS D boasts some of 
the top home fields in the country. 

"I feel that our athletic facilities, 
as well as our location, are very 
attractive to recruits," Edwards said. 

Coming into his third year as the 
Triton directOr of athletics, 
Edwards has two goals for the pro-
gram. 

"I want to focus on marketing 
the program as well as assessing our 
current faci lities to see where we 
need to improve," Edwards said. 

As for marketing, Edward wants 
to focus on adverti ing both on and 
off campus to really get the word 
out about UCS D athletics. He 
would like to get both the student 
body and the community behind the 

teams. 
In terms of athletic facilities, he 

was very confident that the school is 
among the best in the nation, with 
the exception of the baseball field . 

To remedy that situation, a pro-
posal has been made to make a $4 
million renovation to the current 
field that would include lighting for

Triton Director: Athletic Director Earl 
W. Edwards wants to renovate the 
Tritons' baseball stadium. 

There have been several 
tragedies over the summer that have 
led to some changes in UCSD's ath-
letic department. 

The death of Minnesota 
Viki ngs offensive tackle Korey 
Stringer, who passed away due to 
heat stroke during the Vikings' 
training camp, has led to a more 
stringent emergency policy among 
the athletic teams. 

"We are always concerned about 
emergencies involving student ath-

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

letes," Edwards sa id . "We don't 
have extreme climate conditions lin 
La Jolla] or a football program that 
would be more prone to condition-
ing complications, but we have put 
new emergency plans into place." 

Edwards cited communication as 
a major role in preventing tragedies. 

"We saw that in the tragedies 
over the summer, there was a lack of 
communication ," Edwards said . 
"We recently purchased new radios 
for all of the depar01lents so tllat we 
can keep in constant contact and 
react quickly if omething does go 
wrong. 

"Our primary concern is the 
welfare of the s[Udent-athlete," he 
said . 

The other tragedy, and the more 
recem of the two, was the tcrronst 
arrack on New York and 
\Vashington. 

Edwards sa id that the coach e~ 
have been in communi C'Jtion with 
the players and have spell! a lot of 
time JU t talking about how they 
feel. 

"Our coaches have really taken 
the timc to talk to the kids about 
how lhey feel about what IS going 
on ," Edwards said. "Talking about it 
is important in tile healing process. 
As for the players, it may be hard 
for them, but they know that they 
have games to play and they know 
what they have to do." 

In the end, the Tritons appear 
poised to work through these 
tragedies and charge toward anoth-
er successful sea on in Division II 
competition . 

Edwards is very excited about 
the future of UCSD athletics. 

"I feel extremely confiden t about 
the coming year, " Edwards said . "I 
think tllat it is defini tely clear that 
Ithe move to Dlvtsion II] was the 
right move for us . We will only get 
better with time as we are still in the 
learning curve. 

"I feel very fortunate to be the 
director of athletics for this pro-
gram. "

ruESDAY, SEPTEMBER 18,2001 

Because: 
Lack of fan sUPJ>'>rt takes 
away from Triton athletics 
ConIInued fIom ,. All 
not have the most talented recruits 
in the nation, but I say that is pre-
cisely what makes this program so 
great. 

I've been around my share of 
blue-chip recruits and seen my share 
of Division I games. While there are 
feelings of mystique and excitement 
that abound from these games, I 
would argue that they are not the 
most exciting ones to watch. 

Most Division I players starred 
on their high school teams. They 
got all of the glory and were ueated 
like gods. Many of them did not 
have to work as hard as the other 
,players did to get where they are. 
)hey simply coasted through prac-
tices, and even games. 

A story came out this spring 
about how Kobe Bryant, the Los 
Angeles ulcers guard, would pur-
potely slack off during high school 
games to make them close so that he 
could be the hero in the end. These 
are the kind of players that populate 
Division I spons programs. 

Now take a look at the Division 
- U athletes. They were still good, if 

_ not the stars of their teams. Maybe 
they did not get all of the glory and 
were not reauited as heavily by 
Division I schools. For the most 
pan. they had to work harder than 
others to get to where they wanted 
to be. They were the best because 
they worked for it, not because they 
were born with freakish talent. 

These are the players who dive 
for the loose balls in basketball 
gameJ, make the hustle plays in 
baseball, and ouuun people for 
loose balls in soccer. These players 
play with an unparalleled passion for 
the game. For most of them, their 
athletic careers end with their col-
lege careers, and they know that. 

That is why they ueat each and 
every oollege game like it is special. 

It is this passion that can plainly 
be seen on the playing field. That is 
what makes them so exciting to 
watch. 

An overused critique against 
UCSD athletics is that there is no 
football team here. Some say that 
we can never be considered an ath-
letic school without a football pro-
gram. That's I bunch of crap. 

Just because we don't have a 
football team doesn't mean that the 
rest of our spons are horrible or 
uninteresting. We have one of the 
best women's soccer programs in 
the nation, taking national tides in 
three of the past four years. Our 
men's water polo team finished sec-
ond in the nation last year while 
oompeting in an open league full of 
Division I schools. 

We have exciting spons teams. 
That is not the issue. 

The only thing this school needs 
is fan support. Without fan support, 
exciting games can seem dull to the 
few spectators that bothered to 
attend. 

Ask yourself this: When you 
went to the football games in high 
school - and even at other colleges 
- were they fun because the teams 
were so good or were they fun 
because or the crowd aunosphere? 

If you are honest with yourself, 
you'll find that it was just being sur-
rounded by thousands of fans root-
ing for a team that made the experi-
ence special. That is the feeling that 
you think that you are missing by 
not having a football team: the 
unity. I have news for you: You don't 
need a football team to feel that 
unity. You can just as easily get it 
from a basketball game or a soccer 
match. 

That last one threw you for a 
loop, didn't it? A soccer match can't 
actually be fun, you tell yourself. If 
that is your mindset, then I invite 
you to go down to the next women's 
soccer match with a bunch of your 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

friends. Get into the game. Have 
fun with it. And the next time a 
UCSD soccer player scores, get 
your group of friends to go running 
down the sidelines with the players, 
screaming "GOOOMAL!" while 
sliding on your knees and tearing off 
your shirt I guarantee it will make 
the event more exciting. 

You might want to bring extra 
shirts to tear. Our women's soccer 
team is really good. They even have 
the No. 1 rank in the nation to 
prove it 

Even if that day's action isn't -
especially exciting - I promise 
those days will be uncommon with 
UCSD spons - you can relax as 
you watch the event from some of 
the finest facilities in the nation. 

Few basketball and volleyball 
complexes can rival RIMAC Arena. 
The soccer stadium at UCSD is 
second to none, along with some of 
the other facilities, like 
Canyonview Pool. While on the 
subject of choice sporting venues, I 
should mention that there are plans 
to build a $4 million addition to the 
baseball field that will make it one 
of the best in the country to watch 
a ballgame in. 

Still not oonvinced that being a 
fan at Triton sporting events will be 
a good time? Well, if you don't want 

. to do it to suppon your school, then 
at least do it to be greedy. 

This year at UCSD home spon-
ing events, fans will have the oppor-
tunity to win prizes through volley-
ball serving contests, soccer skill 
contests and other fun activities. 
Fans will also have the chance to 
win valuable prizes, including 
round-uip airline tickets, a uip to 
Hawaii, :I new car or even 520,000. 

With all of these reasons, how 
can you not be excited by the 
upcoming season of Triton athlet-
ics? I know I am. 

Trust me, if you go out and sup-
pon our teams, you will have a good 
time. Why? 

Because I said so.

Men's soccer struggles 
early in the season 
Tritons start off slowly with a 1,3 record 
8y JOSH CROUSE 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's soccer team 
came into the year with high expecta-
tions. The athletes were coming off 
an impressive freshman season in 
Division II play in which they cap-
tured the South Division of the 
always-tough California Collegiate 
Athletic Association. 

Unfortunately, they have encoun-
tered a case of the sophomore blues 
and are suuggling as the 2001 season 
opens this year. 

Picked by the coaches to repeat as 
the South Division champs, the 
Tritons opened this season by taking 
on Western Washington at Triton 
Soccer Stadium on Aug. 30. 

Despite a phenomenal effort in 
goal by junior Ryan Weirich, Viking 
sophomore Cody Hagler headed 
home the game winner at almost six 
minutes into the first sudden death 
period to give Western Washington 
the slim 1-0 victory. 

UCSD looked to rebound in its 
CCAA conference opener Sept. 4. on 
the road against California State 
University San Bem.lrdino, picked to 
finish last in the Southern Division. 

The surprising Coyotes were rid-
ing a two-game winning sueak to 
open the season and were very confi-
dent as they upset the Tritons 2-\' 

CSUSB senior Travis Miller 
delivered the game-winning goal off 
an assist from Jason Koza with 12:36 
to go in the match. KoU! also assisted 
on the Coyotes' first goal, a shot 
from Salvador Sandoval from 30 
yards out that hit the back of the net 
with 8:41 left in the first half. 

UCSD's lone goal carne off the 
foot of team captain Kris Chiles, with 

27 :51 left in the second period . 
The Tritons did have two chances 

to knOt the game at two in the wan-
ing. minutes, but were denied by 
CSUSB goalie Matt Keane, dropping 
UCSD to 0-2 on the year. 

The two-game skid continued 
with a 3-1 loss to nonconference 
opponent Seatde Pacific on Sept. 6 at 
Triton Soccer Stadium. 

After a scoreless first half, the two 
teams errupted in a four-minute nur-
ry of offense early in the second half. 

Falcon sophomore Michael 
Schefter scored twO goals in a minute's 
span to give Seatde Pacific a 2-0 lead. 

UCSD got back into the game with 
a goal from sophomore Sean Summers 
off a cross from Tyler Girimonte. 

The Falcons put the game away 
when Bobby Schefter, the older 
brother of Michael Schefter, con-
nected after a long kick from Seatde 
Pacific goalie James Ward. 

Seattle Pacific, ranked No. 13 in 
the NCAA Division II Preseason 
Poll, improved to 3-3 on the season 
while the Tritons fell to 0-3. 

UCSD was able to fight through 
its early-season suuggles for a con-
vincing 2-0 victory over Cal Poly 
Pomona, Sept. 8 at Pomona. 

The Tritons suuck first with a 
goal from Chiles in the Brd minute 
of the game. The team muck again 
five minutes later with a goal from 
Ali Managhebi off of a pass from 
David Ower. 

Weirich held strong in the goal 
for UCSD, posting the shutout. 

In the wake of Tuesday's uagic 
terrorist attacks, the Tritons dropped 
a Wednesday m~tch against confer-
ence-rival Grand Canyon 5-2 at Rose

ross country runs around competition 
Strong men's team ready to race while first-year runners bolster the women's team 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
:.ports Editor 

As the UCSD cross country sea-
son begins, head coach Ted Van 
\r;Jale looks at both hIS men 's and 

women's teams aud sees a mI rror 
Image: Last year 's expcrienced 
women's team has been infused with 
freshmen while his once-young 
men's team ha matur~d into an 
adept group of runners. 

"The dynamics of the men and 
women this year are different," Yolll 
\rsdale said. "The women are like 
he men last year. There ,Ire a lot of 
'~w faces; alX>ut two-thirds of them 

,I re new runners."

"\Ve're just waiting for the right

We are looking to the rerurnees to

Sung ran a 19: I 0.5 in the UC 
Irvme Invitational to place 16th in a 
fidd crowded with nlllners from 

Di\~sion I scholarship programs. 
The women's team will also be 

seeking some strong performances 
from its first-year runners, and 
,1ccording to Van Arsda le, freshman 
Lindsay Stalker has "made her pres-
ence quite evident" by posVng the 
\econd-quickest individual time for 
the Tritons in their dual meet

behind Sung, who came in first in 
front of six PLNU runners. She also 
finished 74th overall in the UC 
Irvine Invitational. 

Other impressive freshmen who 
have caught Van Arsdale's eye are 
Lindsey Young and Erin Richards, 
who placed 92nd and 104th, respec-
tively, out of 145 runners in the UC 
Irvine Invitational. 

"They're coming along extreme-
ly well," Van Arsdale said. 

On the men's side, the team that 
improved in leaps and bounds last 
year to finish third in the CCM 

Championship has tarted off strong 
this year. 

"All 18 runners from last year 
now have experien e and are show-
ing it," Van Arsdale said. 

Despite losing star runner James 
Nielsen to graduation, team captain 
Stephen Martin and top returnees 
David Dunbar and Alan Shapiro 
have picked up the slack and led the 
Tritons to a victory over PL U as 
well as a sixth-place finish out of 16 
tOtal teams in the UC Irvine 
Invitational. 

"We really don 't have one strong 

guy like last year," Martin said. "We 
just have a bunch of good runners." 

Van Arsdale credits their depth as 
a key to their success this year. 

"The tightness between [the o. 
I runner] and [the No. IS runner] is 
very condensed," he said. "The level 
of experience has made a big differ-
ence. They have proved talent and 
experience make a diffe rence. Next 
year we'll be at an even better level."

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, 2001 THE UCS D GUARDIAN SPORTS An 

UCSD athletics charge into 2001-2002 season 
Athletic director excited about last year's results and this year's expectations 
By 10SH CROUSE 
Sports Editor 

UCSD has every reason to be excit-
ed about this years sports program. 

The Tritons have a year of experi-
ence and matority under their belts 
from competing in Division II and 
eem poised to improve on their 

impressive numbers from a year ago. 
Director of Athletics Earl W. 

Edwards is very optimistic about 
another season of Division II sports 
here at UCSD. 

"We did an outstanding job last 
year [in our first year of Division II , 
competition] ," Edward!\, said. "We 
woold like to use that as a foundation 
for this year. We expect another suc-
cessful year." 

The Tritons were certainly 
impressive in their inaugural season 
of Division II play. UCSD caprured 
one national title and one national 
runner-up. In addition, seven teams 
made the playoffs and nine had win-
ning records. 

These impressive Stats earned the 

sclv:>ol a fourth-place finish in the 
prestigious Sears Director 's Cup 
standings. The award is given to the 
top arhletic program in each national 
division of college sports. 

The high finish was a pleasant 
surprise to Edwards. 

"To finish in the top five in our 
tirst year of Division II competition 
is a major accomplishment," Edwards 
said. "If someone had asked me if we 
would even finish in the top 50 in our 
first year, then I would have thought 
that to be unlikely." 

Another reason for optlmlsm is 
the continui ty of last year's coaching 
staff. 

All coaches have rcrurncd from 
last year's spons teams, giving the 
athletes the comfort level that comes 
from working with the same coach. 

"I laving all of our coache back 
from last year will really help the 
program," Edwards said." ot only 
does it help with the current teams, 
but it also helps with recruiting." 

Coaches who know a program can 
be better equipped to know what a 

UCSD women's soccer begins the quest anew 
Tritons looking for a repeat 
B ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Sports Editor 

Riding a wave of high expecta-
tions, the UCSD women's soccer 
team begins its second year III 
Division II ranked No. I in the 
nation by an NCAA preseason poll. 
The team is also favored to win the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association for the second straight 
season in a poll taken of league 
coaches. 

UCSD is favored to win the 
South Division while Sonoma State 
(ranked II th in the nation) is picked 
to win the North Division. Cal State 
Bakersfield (ranked 25th in the 
nation) is predicted by the coaches to 
win the Central Division. Cal Poly 
Pomona (ranked 18th nationally) and 
UC Davis (coaches' wildcard pick) 
are both expected to be in the playoff 
hunt as well . 

The defending national champs, 
led by 15th year head coach Brian 
McManus, began the quest for their 
second straight Division II National 
Championship and CCAA title with 
a convincing 5-0 victory over 
Humboldt State on Aug. 26 and 
haven't looked back since. UCSD 
outshot Humboldt State 12 -2 in the 
first half and controlled the ball 
throughout the game. 

Cordova and senior mid fielder ikki 
Rtchards also contributed goals to 
the Tnton victory while sophomore 
goalkeeper Kami Poma posted her 
first shutout of the season. 

Four days later, the Tritons ho t-
ed Alliant International and again 
came away with a dominant 5-0 vic-
tory. 

Senior All-American and team 
captain Julia Cuder led the Tritons 
with two goals, both off penalty 
kicks, while fellow seniors Erib 
Alfredson and Laura Dooly also 
added a goal each. 

The Tritons had three goa lies -
Poma, Carolyn Cadci and Jamie 
Lautenschleger - combine for the 
shutout. When the dust cleared, the 
Tritons had outs hot thei r opponents 
33-1. 

On Sept. 4, UCSD traveled to 
San Bernardino, Calif., for its league 
opener and posted its third straight 
five-goal game in a 5-1 victory over 
the Coyotes. Sophomore forward 
Kristin Jones had two- goals, and 
Alfredson scored once and assisted 
on two others. 

MilcJos and sophomore Megan 
Mendoza added a goal apiece for' 
UCSD, while the Tritons' high-
octane offense was paired with a stel-
lar defense that aliowed only nine 
shots on goal. 

If anything, this team seemed 
stronger than last year's, as it fearured 
a well-balanced scoring attack that 
included two goals from freshman 
forward Anne-Marie MilcJos. 

Senior mid fielder Elizabeth 
Hughes, senior forward Jessica 

On Sept. 8, the women's tcam 
traveled to Pomona to square off 
against its rival, Cal Poly. The team 
won in heart-stopping fashion, net-
ting a goal in the waning seconds of

Women's volleyball starts off strong 
Triton~ start off 7-2 and are ranked 22nd in the nation in Division II 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Sports Editor 

After reaching the playoffs in its first Division II 
season, the UCSD women's volleyball team begins 
its second year with experience and a better under-
standing of its new level of competition. 

The Tritons are ranked No. 4 in the Ca lifornia 
Collegiate Athletic Association Women's 
Volleyball Preseason Coaches Poll behind CSU 
Los Angeles, which won the CCM championship 
last year with a 30-0 record last year; CSU San 
Bernardino, which ousted the undefeated Golden 
Eaglcs from the playoffs and went on to lose to 
Hawaii Pacific University in the championship 
game; and CS Bakersfield , which won 10 traight 
CCAA titles before being upstaged last year by Cal 
State L.A. 

Head coach Duncan McFarland is pleased With 

the rankings and respect shown to UCSD. 
"I thought that [poll] was pretty accurate," he 

said. "I was surprised to see what the other schools 
thought. I thought it was neat that they had that 
much respect for a new team in the conference." 

McFarland believes that his incoming freshmen 
will help the team live up to its rankings. 

"We did have a good recruiting year and attract-
ed some very good freshmen," he said. "[For exam-
plel Teresa Ohm - we knew she'd be a very good 
setter. Although she's smaller than our returning set-
ter, she runs a faster-paced offense," 

Ohta had been offered several full scholarship 
but rurned them down to come to UCS D. 

McFarland sa id freshmen Katie I logan and Stacy 
Dunsmore are also key player for the Tritons this 
year.

team needs and recruit for those

likely to sign with a program if they 
know that they will be worki ng with

ISAAC PEARLM • ..\J." 

I n the wake of national tradeg ies such as the horrific 
destruction of the World 
Trade Center, there nat-
urally comes an immedi-
ete suspension of sports 
from American culture. 

This pause gives the nation time 
to sift through the reverberations and 
emotions resulting from the cala nllty 
that has occurred, as well as respect-
fully acknowledging that there are 
indeed more important things in lifc 
than sport. 

Victims, their fami lies and the 
public have to adjust to a completely 
new situation following a tragedy of 
this magnirude. Unforrunately, there 
are several precedents for this type of 
event. During D-Day in World War 
n, baseball games were canceled fOI 
two days. After the 1989 earthquake, 
the World Series was postponed for a 
week. 

Inevitably, the powers that be 
must decide when to restore the now 
of sports to the American people. In 
the aftermath of the tragedy last 
week, the National Football League 
chose to suspend all games on 
Sunday, while Major League Baseball 
postponed all games until Sept. 17. 

In my opinion, these decisions, 
while well-intentioned, were not in 
the best interests of America . I 
believe that football should not have 
canceled its games and that basehall 
should have waited until a day or two 
after our national day of mourning 
and remembera nce to hegin aboain . 

I fee l this way for sel'eral reasons, 
cold-hearted logic being one of 
them. Obviously, the fewer gamcs 
delayed, the easier rescheduling will 
be. But since football, baseball and 
several other sports have been affect-
ed, the task of rescheduling ari ses. 

NFL representatives have men-
tioned three possibi lities they are con-
sidering: cancel the missed game and 
have all teams (except the San Diego 
Chargers who had a bye last week) 
play only IS games, extend the season 
a week and replace the first week of 
playoffs lvith the games that were sup-
posed to be pbyed last Sunday, or pcr-
form a rescheduling miracle :111 <1

Fall films provide plenty of entertainment 
Hollywood showcases promising, serious films in the upcoming months 
By CHARLIE TRAN 
Hiatus Editor 

Summer movies are similar to 
buttered popcorn: They tend to give 
you a savory taste but not much sub-
stance. 

Summer 200 1 had few high-qual-
ity movies and few bright spots. 
That's why fall films, which tend to 
take more chances, are more worthy 
Oscar contenders. The fall 200 1 line-
up is remarkably diverse and includes 
comedies, period pieces and fantasy 

~scapes . 
Here is a look at the no-popcorn-

necessary films that are coming out 
this fall. 

"Training Day" 
Sept. 21 

Who's in it: Denzel Washington 
and Ethan Hawke. 

What it's about: Jake Hoyt 
(Hawke), a young and ambitious 
undercover investigator, is assigned 
to an anti-drug squad led by deco-
rated veteran Sgt. Alonzo Harris 
(Washington). Harris is a corrupt 
official who is as terrible as the 
criminals he is chasing. Hoyt is 
faced with a problem as his morality 
is challenged by the decadent ways 
of his boss. 

Outlook: Two great actors are 
paired well in this drama. The plot 
is overdone by Hollywood, but 
whenever you get Washington in a 
good role, he usually steals the 
show. 

"Zoolander" 
Sept. 28 

Starring: Ben Stiller, Owen 

112 Price AI Mixed Drinks 
Including Premium Brands 

200z. DomestIc Big Beers $2.95 
200z. DomestIc Big Beers S3.95 

$1 Off WIne By The Glass 

Wilson , Will Ferre11 , Christine 
Taylor, Jerry Stiller and Milia 
Jovovich. 

What it's about: Derek 
Zoolander (Sti ller) is the world 's 
most famous supermodel. Trouble 
ensues when male models are being 
brainwashed by an organization to 
assassinate world leaders. Derek 
must work with his archrival, Hansel 
(Wilson), to stop the plan and save 
the world. 

Outlook: Stiller has been on a roll 
since his channing performance in 
"Meet the Parents." "Zoolander" 
looks like another movie that will 
make it big the theaters. ' Although 
silly and childish, expect much laugh-
ter not only from Stiller but also 
from the promising Wilson. Also 
look for Stiller's dad, Jerry, who plays 
a modeling agent. 

"Serendipity" 
Oct. 5 

Who's in it: John Cusack and 
Kate Beckinsale. 

What it's about: Fate seems to 
be shining down upon Cusack's and 
Beckinsale's characters as a chance 
encounter leads to a wonderful 
night on the town . They like each 
other, but Beckinsale decides to let 
destiny decide the future of their 
affection and leaves a possible sec-
ond meeting to chance. They next 
meet a decade later when 
Beckinsale's character is about to be 
married. 

Outlook: "Sleepless In Seattle" 
redux? This is a nice date movie or 
chick flick, but unfortunately the far-
fetched plot lacks both the charisma 
and charm of "Sleepless In Seattle:" 

Cusack is an excellent actor with 
great range, but this looks like anoth-
er "America's SweetheartS" fiasco. 

"Corky Romano" 
Oct. 12 

Whos in it: Chris Kattan, Peter 
Berg, Chris Penn and Peter Falk. 

What it's about: Kanan plays a 
vegetarian obsessed with 1980s 
music. When his mobster family gets 
into trouble with the law, they ask 
him to infiltrate the FBI to destroy 
any incriminating evidence. 

Outlook: Some films were born to 
be funny and witty. This lackluster 
movie should have been sti llborn. 
Kanan's annoying comedy is unfor-
tunately the main attraction. Like 
most "Saturday Night Live" skits 
that are transferred to the big screen, 
this movie's minimal appeal will 
cause it to die out fas ter than you can 
drop an o-chem course. 

"From Hell" 
Oct. 19 

Who 's in it: Johnny Depp, 
Heather Graham and Robbie 
Coltrane. 

What it's about: In Victorian 
London, the streets are ominous as 
Jack the Ripper goes on a killing 
rampage. Psychic inspector 
Abberline (Depp) suspects a conspir-
acy and is determined to solve the 
mystery and identify the serial killer. 
In his hunt, he fa lls for a Cockney 
prostitute (Graham) who is in immi-
nent danger. 

Outlook: The Hughes brothers, 
who have directed many urban street 
dramas, are an awkward fit for this 
period drama, but it will be interest-

ing to see if their expertise can make 
it something gripping. 

This is not another "SI.eepy 
Hollow," but expect a great perfor-
mance from Depp. Unfortunately, 
this cannot be extended to Graham, 
whose acting abilities, like Jack's 
identity, are unknown and missing. 

"K-PAX" 
. Oct. 26 

Who's in it: Kevin Spacey, Jeff 
Bridges, Mary McCormack and 
Alfred Woodard. 

What it's about: In a mental hos-
pital, Prot (Spacey), a mysterious 
patient, claims to come from the 
planet K-PAX. A doctor (Bridges) 
who monitors Prot tries to convince 
him otherwise, but the further he 
delves into Prot's mind, the more he 
startS believing that Prot may be an 
alien after all. 

Outlook: Remember "Don Juan 
Demarco?" If not, you're missing 
out on a film with a similar plot to 
"K-PAX." Spacey has pl ayed 
quirky characters in "American 
Beauty" and "The Usual 
Suspects," and it looks like he 's 
displaying his excellent acting abil-
Ities once again. The movie seems 
like an Oscar-contender with a cast 
that also includes the ven erable 
Bridges. But be warn ed: Although 
the movie looks promising, it may 
be a dud (remember "Pay it 
Forward?"). 

"Novocaine" 
Oct. 26 

Who's in it: Steve Martin, Laura 
Dern and Helena Bonham Carter. 

What it's about: Martin plays a 

fairly nonnal doctor with a thriving 
practice. He lives a predictable life 
with his obse sive-compulsive fiancee 
(Dern). After meeting a drug-addict-
ed patient (Caner), hiS once-nonnal 
life is turned upside down and he i 
accused of several crimes involving 
biza rre murders. 

Outlook: This is a different step 
for Martin as this film is much more 
awkward and darker than his previ -
ous fi lms. However, there is no one 
better than Martin to bring life to 
awkward screwball-comedy. If you're 
willing to step outside the norm, this 
eccentric film should be a lOY to 
watch . 

"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's 
Stone" 
Nov. 16 

Who's in it: Maggie Smith, Alan 
Rickman, Daniel Radcliffe, Richard 
Harris, Rupert Grim and Emma 
Watson. 

What it's about: Based on the first 
book of J.K. Rowling's series, 11 -
year-old Harry (Radcliffe) begins his 
travels in a magical world of fantasy 
and delight. An explanation of hiS 
mysterious childhood and his train-
ing as a sorcerer are guided by hiS 
mentor, Professor Dumbledore 
(Harris). While at his new school, 
Hogwarts, mysterious occurcnces 
trouble him. 

Outlook: This is one of fall 's most 
anticipated films. A variety of view-

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 18,2001 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Study breaks just got sicker 
}oecartoon.com low on taste, high on hilarity . 
BY CLAIRE VANNmE 
Features Editor 

Computers: Sure, they're lov-
able, but are they actually useful? 
Aside from firing up the old beige 
box to, say, write a term paper or 
exchange e-mails with grandma, 
why push that little green button at 
all? 

How about the sheer, irrational 
joy of watching a foul-mouthed 
frog be pureed to bits at the click of 
your mouse? 

This, and much more, is avail-
able at 7J)1IJWjotCartoon.fom. The 
Web site: riotous. The creator, who 
goes only by Joe Cartoon: a mys-
tery. 

. The inimitable purveyor of 
Flash animation of the most despi-
cable, tasteless and hilarious kind 
has been making the world a little 
funnier since March 20, 1961, his 
birthdate. 

The scant personal information 
he offers on his site raises more 
questions than answers. Can 
Cartoon really "take a toothpick 
and from 200 yards away slam it 
right through your forehead, sub-
stantially lowering your IQ forev-
er?" Does he really play "a mean 
bluesharp?" And is it indeed true 
tnat he is, as he claims, a ninja? 

One fact Cartoon offers cannot 
be disputed: "If Joe thinks it's 
funny, it iSi if you don't, you're stu-
pid." 

When it comes right down to it, 
Cartoon's identity is irrelevant. AI,! 
that matters is that, for whatever 
reason, he is one sick guy. And that 
makes for some funny cartoons. 

As 7J)7J)7J)joullrtoon.com loads -
slowly - it becomes apparent that 
these short films have more in 
common with "South Parle" and 
"Beavis and Butt-Head" than 
Disney or Dreamworks. In the tra-
dition of the former two, the ani-
mation quality is low. Also, much of 

the humor centers on blue-collar, 
white trash Americana, at once 
ridiculing rednecks and celebrating 
their unique approach to life. 

Take, for example, the Joe 
Cartoon classic "Lump, The No-
Legged Dog." The screen fills with 
a bright-eyed mutt, but as the title 
suggests, cute little Lump is miss-
ing all appendages. The unseen 
narrator, his owner, belittles 
Lump's pathetic attempts to per-
form tricks like staying ("Like you 
could go anywhere''') , lying down 
("Didn't have very far to go, did 
you boy?") and sitting ("You fat , 
stinky dog!"). His hillbilly twang 

One fact Cartoon 
offers cannot be 

disputed: 'If Joe thinks 
it's funny, it is; if you 
don't, you're stupid.' 

and outrage over Lump's destruc-
tion of his treasured Garth Brooks 
T-shirt reveal Cartoon's lowbrow 
roots. 

If the humor of the piece does-
n't come through in print, take it 
on faith that it's worth your log-on 
time. 

Animals figure prominently in 
many of Cartoon's best cartoons. 
"Joefish" features a hamster with a 
beluga-sized attitude being 
dropped into a tank of piranhas. 
The carnage is gratuitous and thor-
oughly entertaining. The 
"Superfly" series chronicles in four 
parts the epic adventures of flies 
who drink beer and get a wicked 
contact high ("Dude, I'm bug-
gin'!"). 

Perhaps the best-Icnown of Joe's 
twisted creations are two cartoons 
not condoned by Black & Decker 
or any other kitchen appliance 
manufacturer: "Frog Blender 2000" 

and "Micro-Gerbil 2001." 
The former puts you at the COIl -

trois of a blender and pits you 
against an insulting frog - who 
happens to be inside the jar. "You 
ain 't got the balls," he taunts you in 
a lazy drawl, "Ya pansy." Needless 
to say, once you have clicked your 
way through the blender's 1 0 
speeds, the frog is in no mood for 
conversation. 

"Micro-Gerbil 2001 " builds 
upon the same principle of an 
obnoxious animal primed for your 
destruction , this time in a 
microwave. The catchphrases are 
different, of course, such as the 
immortal "Who's yo daddy?" The 
wai t -d on 't -c lic k- the-back -bu uon-
yet ending makes it a standout. 

Over the past few months , 
Cartoon's once-pristine shop of 
horrors has become commercial-
ized. Banners and pop-ups now 
slow download times and are 
annoying. Also, the line of "Joe 
Stuff' - merchandise such as T-
shirts and coffee mugs with charac-
ters and catchphrases - seems 
cheap aud opportunistic. However, 
they do make great holiday gifts, 
and the ubiquitous ads keep the site 
free . 

Cartoon may not have class, a 
trust fund, good grammar or good 
spelling, but he does have the best 
game in town for on-the-Web 
laughs. His humor is random and 
his punchlines hot from left field, 
and some of the jokes may make 
you cringe. 

7J)1IJWjouartoon .com is definitely 
not a site to show to your kid sister, 
as expletives and candy-colored 
violence dominate. But at 3 a.m., 
when you thought your keyboard 
could only bring you endless mis-
ery as you hack and sputter through 
a 1 O-page paper due the next morn-
ing, it hits the spot. 

Finally, something practical on 
your computer.

University community hit hard Tuesday 
Attacks of terrorism affect UCSD way of life of students, alumnus 
By MALAVIKA CiANCiOLLY 
Features Editor 

The morning of Tuesday, Sept. 11 
seemed like a relatively normal work-
day in Washington D.C. For Muir 
senior Amanda LaRoche, a partici-
pant in UCSD's Academic Internship 

• Program and an intern at the U.S. 
Department of Education, nothing 
seemed out of the ordinary in the 
nation 's capital. LaRoche and her 
coworkers were going about their 
normal business in the department's 
offices, located next to the Capitol 
building . 
- Miles away in ew York, an inci-
dent would take place that would 
forever change America as we know 
it. It was not until shortly after 9 
a.m . that LaRoche and her col-
leagues first learned of the events 
that were unfolding in ew York 
City. 

Upon learning that American 
Airlines night 11 took an unexpected 
turn' from its course to Los Angeles 
and crashed into Tower One of the 
World Trade Center in lower 
Manhattan, LaRoche and her 
coworkers did not feel they were in 
danger. They, like many people 
across the nation, were watching on 
television as the second plane, later 
identified as United Airlines night 
175, also en route to Los Angeles, 
crashed into Tower Two of the 

World Trade Center. 
According to LaRoche, the 

atmosphere in the office building was 
one of astonishment, as many found 
it hard to believe that the scenes they 
were watching on television were 
real. 

However, shortly after 9:40 
a.m., when a third plane crashed 
into the nearby Pentagon , employ-
ees at the Department of Education 
were told to evacuate the building. 
LaRoche remembers the chaos that 
followed . 

"There was a lot of fear, and we 
were told to evacuate the building 
quickly because the Capitol was seen 
as a target as well," she said. "That 
was the first time I have ever felt a 
physical threat on my Ijfe. By the 
time we got outside, the streets were 
overnowing with people and every-
one was panicbng." 

After she was ushered out of the 
building, LaRoche waited alongside 
hundreds of federal employees who 
were standi ng outside the 
Pentagon, watching as the names 
began to consume a part of the 
building. 

From the nearby metro stop 
right outside the Pentagon, Mujr 
senior and fellow AlP participant 
David Butler also watched as the 
plane first crashed into the building, 
disintegrating into the names 

"I couldn 't understand how this

could have happened at the 
Pentagon, of all places," Butler sa id. 
"This building is known worldwide 
as being incredibly secure and 
impenetrable and I couldn't under-
stand how this large, American carri-
er was able to hit a bujldjng as safe as 
that." 

But apparently, even the safest of 

'That was the first 
time I have ever felt a 
physical threat on my 

life. By the time we got 
outside, the streets 

were overflowing with 
people and everyone 

was panicking.'

Muir senior 

buildings was not strong enough to 
resist the attack that took place that 
day. 

UCSD alumnus Terri Duggan 
Schwartzbeck, who works just 
blocks from the White House, also 
witnessed the attack at the 
Pentngon. Upon hearing the plane 
crash at the Pentagon, 

Schwartzbeck and her colleagues 
quickly evacuated the office build-
ing. According to Schwartzbeck, 
there was a widespread fear that 
other buildings in the area would be 
attacked next. 

"After the Pentagon was hit, we 
realized we were near a big target -
the White House," Schwarrzbeck 
sa id . "It was strange, bur that day 
you evaluated everything a~ ~ poten-
tial target." 

As terrorists attacked symbols of 
modern-day American democracy, 
UCSD students and alumni who 
were present during the attacks -
along with those watching on tele-
vision nationwide, and around the 
world - felt a sense of helpless-
ness. 

Still, the most difficult aspect of 
this national tragedy will most like-
ly be the aftermath. Accori:ling to 
those who witn essed Tuesday'S 
events first-hand, Americans will 
never regai n the same sense of secu-
rity that they felt prior to th e 
attacks. 

Although the government has 
ensured that increased security mea-
sures will be taken, the trauma that 
these events have caused will not be 
easily forgonen . 

"We have to fly back home in 
less than nine weeks," LaRoche 
said. "I have no idea how I am going 
to do that, because once you've 

been through something like thi s, 
everythang changes. It is very diffi -
cult to salvage that sense of securi-
ty." 

According to students, the after-
math of the terrorist attacks has also 
fostered a sense of comllluni ty 
aillong all Americans. T his sense of 
unity was seen at a ca ndlelight VIgil 
that thousands of people attcndcd in 
Washington the night aftcr the 
attacks took place. 

"We all have something in com-
mon now," Butler said. "No matter 
what part of the United States you 
live in, you were affected by these 
events, and because we all have thl~ 
shared experience, there is a sense of 
unity among all Americans followmg 
the tragedy that took place." 

While few can soon forgct the 
images of the attacks, these students 
are now strugglin g to somehow 
cope with this tragedy. As the sea rch 
for those missing conti nues In both 

ew York and \Vas hln glOn, 
Americans hold with them a sense 
of hope that one day, they will 
recover from the anguish caused by 
the loss of thousands of innocent 
lives. 

"This will definitely be a day I 
wi ll never forget," Butler said. "ThiS 
was a day I was forced to review my 
own invincibility - and that has 
given me a whole new per pectl"c 
on life its~ lf."

Surviving the college 'crack up' 
Dealing with th problems of life through the readings and word of femin ist work 
By LI NDSAY BOYD 
StaffWnter 

\\ l Ull was 11110 t afraId of when I 
came to college ' I would have to say 
the "Freshnu n 15." It IS wh:u leg-
ends arc made of and what made me 
bur th ree dIfferent -SIZed pairs of 
jCJI1>. 1I 0rrymg that my waIst would 
qUIckly expand to unthlllkable pro-
portions. 

l 'nfo rtunately, that was the least 
of m)' problcm!>. While I have no 
reltable dIet advice, I can offer some 
ad\'lce on another freshman epIdem-
IC: the college crack-up. 
. I'm not talki ng about the feeling 
that you are losmg your mind duriJlg 
finals. That's normal. What I mean 

is a long tradItion of severe college-
induced nervou breakdowns. From 

vlvla Plat h to Elizabeth \Vunzel , 
I~a n y great women have had them. 

If you look at the hIStory of 
famolls females, a lor of them were, 
shall I say, a little nun)'. A bout of 
psychosis IS nor a sign of wea kn ess: 
It meam. you 're "speciaL" 

Wi th today's pharmaco logy, 
almost everyone can be effectively 
treated for what ails them. But con-
sidering that most antidepressants 
take four to six weeks to start work-
mg, there are some great books to 
read in the meantime. 

Plath , Wurtzel and Virginia 
Woolf kept me company in the 
da rkest hours of my freshman year. I 

hope someone, somewhere will find 
solace in "T he Bell Jar" or "Bitch: In 
Praise of Difficult Women." 

Perhaps the quimessemial piece 
of fem-depression literature is 
Plath's "T he Bell Jar," which is based 
upon her own breakdown at Smith 
College. '''The Bell Jar' chronicles 
the crack-up of Esther Greenwood," 
notes its publisher, Harper Collins. 
"Brilliant, beautiful , enormously tal -
ented and successful, but slowly 
going under." 

Aren't we melodramatic? If it is 
any consolation, if you ever feel that 
you are "slowly going under," just 
remember that you are also "bril -
liant, beautiful, enormously talented 
and successful." 

Whi le Plath has her place in his-
tory, a better recommendation for 
the modern nutcase is "Prozac 
Nation," by Elizabeth Wurtzel. Of 
all the sad teenage gi rl memoirs -
and there are quite a few - this is by 
far the best. 

In fact, all of Wurtzel's books, 
"Prozac ation," "Bitch" and 
"Radica l Sanity" are essential for 
anyone losing her mind and trying 
to find it. 

In "Prozac Nation," Wurtzel 
writes about her colorful life as a 
child of divorce who spent the 
school year cutting her legs in the 
gi rls' bathroom and her ~ummers

Fight against 
media bias 
now proves 
perplexing 

TheEditor' sSoa pbox 
By MARGARET O'NEILL 
News Writer 

Whoever created Superman mis-
led mi ll ion of comic book-readers. 
Journalists are not superheroes like 
the mi ld-mannered reporter Clark 
Kent. ewsOash: Journaltsts arc 
just people. 

Most Ameri ca n don't think 
about who is behind the "ncws" 
they read, hear or watch . For most 
of my life, I didn't. But one morning 
in high school, I read a local news 
column in wh ich the writer dI S-
cussed media bias. 

T he news was never the same for 
me. I never .agai n took media at face 
value; I always thought about the 
motivation of the people behind it. 

"The bias of the press" became 
my obsession. I kept articles on the 
topic, taken from the three news-
papers that my family received, in a 
scrapbook. I also began my ques t to 
become an honest journalist. 

T his yea r, I have the power to 
make a difference. As news edi tor, I 
plan to work hard to hone tly and 
fairl y represen t the people and 
organizations at UCSD. 

Journahsm is a business. A small 
number of corporations own a 
majority of the coun try's da ily 
pape rs, magazines and television 
stations. 

T he Hearst Corp., for example, 
owns 12 U.S. da ily newspapers, 18 
U.S. weeklies, 16 U.S. magazines, 
two newspaper s.yndica tes, 27 
broadcast TV stations, 11 cable TV 
networks, six radio stations and 
countless other ventures. It is a 
business, and all readers, listeners 
and viewers need to keep that in 
mind. 

I took a class last year on the 
"rhetoric of the news," in which the 
concept of objectivity was chal-
lenged . The instructor argued that 
objectivity - the act of representa-
tion without extraneous factors - is 
not possible. I do, and do not, agree 
with him. 

While complete objectivity can-
not be achieved because human 
beings are imperfect, the highest 
level of objectivity is still sought by 
many noble members of the profes-
sion. 

Readers, li steners and viewers 
sometimes forget that the news is 
brought to them by other human 
beings. It is subject to human error, 
as are the fruits of any labor. 

Deliberate error is what I try to 
be wary of. 1 believe that it does 
occur. Right- or left-leaning news-
papers publish Uftflattering pictures 
of unfavored candidates and this is 
not accidental. 

The position of the management 
of a newspaper often is not only 
exhibited on its editorial page, but 
throughout the newspaper. I believe 
that such partiali ty is immoral. 

A one-way slant on the editoria l 
page is not wrong; the staff mem-
bers are entitled to their opinions. 
If this bias appears elsewhere, there 
is a problem. If you can tell the 
political leanings of a paper by its 
news coverage, there is a problem. 

In the news rhetoric class, we 
analyzed the "framing" of issues in

Bias: 
Unintentional slants 
unavoidable without help 
Continued from page B8 
the news and searched for inconsis-
tencies in coverage of similar 
events. 

When ( began the class. ( already 
looked skeptica lly at the news. All 
the discussed examples of bias could 
easi ly be seen as deliberate. Maybe 
because I have trouble believing 
that people are all bad. Maybe, 
because I'm a journalisl myself, I 
thought that this was hard to swal-
low. I could not, and still cannot, 
believe that most journalists delib-
erately try to lead their audiences 
one way or another. Sometimes it 
happens, bur [ do not consider it the 
norm. 

Maybe I have a more optimistic 
view due to my experiences at The 
UCSD Guardian . Because . the 
Guardia71 is a college newspaper, 
none of the editors have a major 
financial investment ill the paper, 
and because we represent a wide 
range of opinions, I have noticed 
very linle intentional bias in our 
paper. 

If the Guardian , particularly the 
news section, seems to under-repre-
sent or misrepresent anything at 
UCSD, [ can honestly say thal it is 
not due to editorial bias; it is 
because we were unable to deter-
mine how to find information in 
other directions. I apologize now 
for the unintentional bias that will 
undoubtedly appea r in the news sec-
lion - it's sadly unavoidable. 

As this year's news editor, I ask 
fo r your help in my qu es t to fai rl y 
represent what goes on at UCSD . 
Educa te me. I'm a person and a 
studeIH li ke you . I ta ke classes, I 
ha\'e lests and I try to be SOCial as 
well. As a resu lt, r miss things . I'm 
not Superman and I don'l have 
bionic viSIOn that enables me to 
see everything goi ng on eve ry-
where. 

There are several way for people 
to inform the Guardian of events 
and circumstances. T he staff box on 
page two of every issue lists the edi-
tors, thei r phone numbers, e-mail 
addresses and the location of the 
Guardill1l office. Use th is info rma-
tion. Our newspaper is here to 
inform and represent the students 
of UCSD, but we need everyone's 
help to figure out how. 

Unintentional bias resul ts from 
being uninformed. I weed through 
massive stacks of press releases 
each week. but few are actually 
pertinent to UCSD. What is? 

We're students like you, and we 
want to know what you find infor-
mative. Our Web si te at 
bttp;l/www.ucsdguardian .org pro-
vides a fo rum for comments. 
Letters to the editor are always wel-
come; if we do not print them. we 
at least try to consider their mes-
sage. 

We were reminded this week 
that journalists are just people. Dan 
Rather, tired and affected by the 
tragedy, stumbled repeatedly over 
his words after several hours on the 
air Sept. II. The tragedy emotion-
ally affected the whole naton, and 
journalists did not escape the toil. 

I bel ieve that the purpose of 
journalism is to fairly represent the 
facts and to provide people with 
the information they need to make 
up their own minds about occur-
rences and issues. Journalism 
should not reach oeyond this. 

To some, journalism is no longer 
seen as a noble profession. I 
promise to try my best to provide 
the most objective news coverage 
possible this year, and I ask for help. 
Feedback is important. Please help 
the Guardian accura tely represent 
UCSD.

computer labs where facuIty, staff, and 
studenu can use email or word-processing 
software, as weU as the Internet. There is a 
large lab in the basement ofGciisd 
Library. for instance. CUCS also allows 
such use. To use the laser printers in the 
labs or CUCS you must set up an account 
beforehand. Free dot-matrix printers are 
available in most labs. 

UCSD faculty, staff, and students 
needing laser printing accounU should go 
to AP&.M 2113 between 10:30 - 3:30 M 
- R Only checks and PLUS cards are 
accepted for print accounU at AP&.M 
2113; scttingup an account with cash is 
possible but more complicated and time-
consuming. CaU 534-4060 or visit www-
acs.ucsd.edu for a list of labs or other 
information. 

How can I print or photocopy in the 
library? 
imprints. ucsa. taullibrary/tkbit.btml 
To print or make copies in any campus 
library (except C:;UCS) you must use a 
debit card from Imprints, the campus 
copy center. This card enables you to print 
from library terminals. computers, and 
micro reader/printers, as well as make 
photocopies. The same card works for 
photocopying at CUCS, but to print 
there. you must set up a printing 
account first (see "Where can I type 
and print my paper?" earlier in this 
FAQ) . 

Card dispensers near 
most photocopiers vend 
debit cards. To obtain a 
card you must insert a $ 1 
biU; a fee of $.25 is charged 
for each new card. 
Addit ional money may be 
put on the card by using 
the same machine. Total 
amounU of$IO or more 
result in " bonus" copies. 

Write your name and 
telephone number on the

TIME WITH AD* ACCESS 

Ad ' Access is a new database that makes available on the Web over 7,000 
advertisements printed in U.S. and Canadian newspapers and magazines 
between 1911 and 1955. Ad ' Access concentrates on five main subject areas: 

Radio, Television, Transportation, Beauty and 
Hygiene, and World War II and provides a coherent 
view of a number of major campaigns and companies 
through images preserved in the Duke Library's J. 
Walter Thompson Company Archives. 

Ad ' Access is fully indexed and provides a cultural 
history of America as seen through advertisements. 
The browse section allows browsing through the five 
main subject areas and 

subcategories. The search feature allows 
searching by keyword or by illustration/special 
features such as Spanish language ads, famous 
people, African-Americans in illustration, or the 
military in il lustration.

Get Ahead, Avoid Research 
Dread, Use Pub Med! 
Have you heard the buzz about PubMed? PubMed is the National Library of Medicine's version of 
MEDLINE, the best database for finding biomedical journal articles. You can use PubMed to find 

- -

, '" .· ta ~ 

is Open 24/5 during Finals Week, Sunday· Wednesday! 
-7J.~ '~,:.,~;-; 

journal articles about many biological and 
medical topics. The Cafifornia Digital 
library (COL) version ofMEDLINE is 
being phased out at the end of this year, so 
if you have been using CDL MEDLINE 
you will need to switch to PubMed soon. 
PubMed has many cool features: links to 
databases of proteins. genomes, structures, -. 

. --'- and nucleotides; access to the most recent 

- citations; the ability to find "related 
articles· with a dick of a button. PubMed 

is available for free on the Web, which is useful if you travel or work in more 
than one location. 

We're working hard to make PubMed even better. Enhancements developed 
especially for University of California users include links to full-text articles in 

journals licensed by COL and UCSD, links to UCSD library holdings in 
print, and a link !O "request that allows UCSD faculty, staff and students to 

request copies of articles not available online (there will be a charge for items 
available in print at UCSD libraries.) 
To access these features, you will ~eed to use a special URL for PubMed. Let 
the librarians at the Biomedical and Medical Center Libraries show you how 
to search PubMed easily and efficiently.

arrange for PubMed training, contact Jeff Williams at (858) 822-2218 or

Jolla selVe up their best 

Whether this is your first year 
of navigating a campus or you're a 
fifth-yea r thinking of adding reI 
another lI1aJor, UCSD ', cnun1llty 
and complexilY can sometimes 
seem too much to bear. During 
these daunting moments, sNdents 
have many resources that can pro-
vide assistance or plain old enter-
tai nment. However, there are a 
ha ndful of campus businesses, 
organizations and nearby getaway 
Spots that stand above the rest. 
These, which are reviewed 
below, toge ther represent the best 
ofUCSD. 

Best Student Organization: 
Board@UCSD 

The lackluster party scene al 
UCSD takes a lot of heat from SN-
dents seeking that famed college 
experience they tim saw in "Animal 
I louse. " There is. however, one 
O<1;IS of craziness among the 
libraries and lecture hall s: 
Board@UCSD. This sNdent orga-
nization truly is a meelJn g of the 
millds - the surfing, ,bteboard-
IIlg, and snowboardlllg IIllllds, thaI 
IS. 

Before thlllking "I don't surf, 
sbte or snowboard. Forget II," 
know that Board@UCSD IS 
responsible for more than Just 
snowboarding trips to Big Bear and 
Mammoth Mountain resorts. Even 
if you aren't graceful on a board, 
make sure to hang out with those 
who are - attending their crowd-
ed, crazy meetings and panics 
might earn you a free snowboard or 
free T-shirts, or you could fi nd that 
kegstand insanity you've been 

dreaming of. Contact the craZInC,s 
directly al bonrd@ucsd.rdu. 

Best Place to rudy: CLiC 
It's ninth week, and unless you 

find a quiel pot where you can 
absorb the genius that your profes-
sor insists is withm Ihe pages of 
your reader for DlIlIenslOns Of 
Culture - or Makin g of the 
Modern World, Warren Writing, 
Revelle Humanities, Muir Wming, 
whatever - you'll fail the final. 

The Center for Learnmg and 
Instructional Compullng Services 
in Revelle college should be of help. 

CLICS rocks for many reasons.

Best: 
A list of must-sees for any 
student 
Continued from page 815 
weight room shown to every cam-
pus tour group, UCSD has other 
on-campus workout facilities for 
students. The Main Gym's weight 
room stands apart from the others. 

Admittedly, RIMAC has the 
greatest variety of weights and 
machines, and it has the most floor 
space, but the Main Gym boasts the 
newest workout equipment. What it 
lacks in floor space and variety is 
made up for with its central location 
and its snazzy, well-maintained 
equipment. We all know that bigger 
isn't necessarily better, so sweat your 
stuff at Main Gym instead of RIMAC 
and fight the freshman 15. For more 
information, visit 
hnp://rtcrratio".uad.tdu. 

Best Eatery: Porter's Pub 
Hands down, Porter's Pub has the 

best food on campus. No day-old 
cafeteria cuisine can compare to this 
menu of drippy submarine sandwich-
es, frothy and frosty beers, and 
grease-laden. perfectly spiced curly 
fries. However, there are a few rules 
of engagement one should know 
before stopping by the Student 
Center to indulge. 

First, never attempt to use a fake 

J.D. at the pub. The employees are 
like hawks when they check your 
legality, and not even the slickest 
falcie will do you any good - it'll 
only get taken away. 

Second, call in your order 10 min-
utes ahead so you only have to wait in 
line to pay - instead of waiting to 
pay, then waiting for your food to be 
made. 

Finally, it is a given that the: 
employees here will not greet you, 
ask you how you're doing, or check 
that your food is up to par. Leave 
them a tip and leave them alone. 
Rumor has it that the Price Center is 
getting a Rubio's, however, so keep 
your eye out for that too. 

Porter's Pub can be reached at 
(858) 587 -482i. 
Best Annual Event: Sun God 

Every spring, UCSD hosts the 
Sun God Festival. For the hard-core 
Sun God loyalists, this is a day on 
which UCSD students imbibe alco-
holic beverages or other intoxicating 
substances, attend class wasted, visit 
the student organization booths set 
up near Sun God field, and then 
party even more at the concert that 
takes place on RIMAC Field that 
evening. 

For less-than-hardcore Sun God 
enthusiasts, be warned that this pat-
tern of activity is unavoidable, so pre-
pare yourselves. After all, without the 
uncharacteristic prevailing attitude of 
peace, love and drunkenness, it 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

would not be the best annual event.

tival , call (858) 534-4450 or visit

Best Date Restaurant: Forever 
Fondue 

Forever Fondue, located on the 
second floor at 1295 Prospect Ave. in 
downtown La Jolla, offers a menu 
and an atmosphere that are unique 
enough to break even the most awk-
ward silences. 

For appetizers, visitors can dip 
fluffy chunks of dark and light breads 
into rich, melty cheeses that cook at 
each party's table. For the main 
course, waiters bring a boiling broth 
to your table, into which you can 
plunge salmon, filet mignon and 
shrimp. For dessert, sink sweet 
morsels of fresh fruit into a smoothly 
melted chocolate of your choice. 

If you haven't experienced fon-
due, keep the mood light by letting 
your date teach you how to perfectly 
dunk these goodies. If you're a fon-
due freale, take on the role of teacher 
and dole out a few lessons of your 
own. If neither you nor your date 
have a clue about the world of fon-
due, even better - learning together 
is a great way to keep those awkward 
first-date silences at bay. 

For rese.rvations, call (858) 551-
4509. 

Best Local Beach: La JoUa Shores 
La Jolla Shores, though crowded 

during peak season, gives sun seekers 
a package that can't be found at any 
other beach near campus. Surfers 
may want to stick to the Scripps Pier 
or Blacks Beach areas, but those 
looking for a relaxing spot to spread 
out their towels will appreciate the 
regularly combed, soft, deep sand 
here, and the impressive view of 
downtown La Jolla. 

Shores has a handful of fire pits 
and barbecues, and the adjacent resi-
dential neighborhood site hosts plen-
ty of eye-catching architecture. 
SOImds touristy, yes, but if you're 
new to San Diego, so what? Hop in 
your car and you're there in five min-
utes. 

Overall, compared to the rowdi-
ness of beaches farther south and Del 
Mar's lack of anything but a family 
scene, La Jolla Shores stands alone as 
the best beach of the area. For more 
information, VISII

Best Place to Get Experience: The 
Academic Internship Program 

The Academic Internship 
Program, located on the second floor 
of Warren college's Literature

hundreds oflocal and non-local orga-
nizations and helps UCSD students 
to secure internships at those organi-
zations.

Best Bookstore on Campus: The 
UCSD Bookstore 

Groundwork Books doesn't 
accept credit cards. Revelle Bargain 
Books maintains only a minimum-
sized selection. The General Store 
Co-Op's long lines are intolerable, 
and it sells only the most commonly 
used texts. Ordering your books from 
online vendors can result in huge . 
'delays if your books are back-
ordered, plus there's the cost of ship-
ping. 

The UCSD Bookstore, on the 
other hand, accepts cash, checks, 
credit and ATM cards, has a plethora 
of readily available books for almost 
every course, and it maintains 
enough staff to keep the lines a little 
less daunting. Early morning is the 
best time to avoid crowds. 

Visit the UCSD Bookstore in the 
Price Center, or find more informa-
tion at hnp:/Iururw-hoolutort.uad.tdu.

Survival: 
Author Wurtzel provides 
account of feminist vitality 
Continued from pap B8 
overdosing on anti-histamines at 
summer camp. 

That story has a somewhat-happy 
ending. I don't want to spoil it for 
you, but perhaps you can infer it 
from the title. 

A movie based on the book will 
star Christina Ricci , Michelle 
Williams and Anne Heche, and will 
be released soon. You always feel 
smarter when you go to a movie and 
say "Oh yeah, _I already read the 
book," don't you? 

Wurtzel also picked up a "Rolling 
Stone" college journalism award 
while attending Harvard and sur-
vived an attempted suicide - "bril-
liant. beautiful , enormously talented 
and successful, bur slowly going 
under." 

In "Bitch," Wurtzel, who always 
writes with a distinctly feminist slant, 
traces the history of women who 
refuse to follow the rules, who refuse 
to stop crying, who refuse to behave, 
who refuse to go quietly. 

While it is discouraging to look 
back on Plath, Woolf and Anne 
Sexton and realize they all killed 
themselves, there is some hope that 
the world is becoming a better place 
for "difficult women ." 

Wurtzel, Susanna Kaysen (who 
wrote "Girl, Interrupted") and 
Beverly Donofrio (author of "Riding 
In Cars With Boys") are still here. So 
remember: If you feel like you are 
"slowly going under" the bell jar this 
year, you're not nuts. You are special 
and in good company.

ons, men's and

always solid and

Its freezer section is stocked with 
college essentials such as frozen piz-
zas and rolled tacos, and they carry all 
the staples, such as mille, cheese, pro-
duce and fresh meat. You can even 
get fresh-cut flowers for your

ingly cheap. 

Beware: If you crave your boxes of 
Lucky Charms and cases of Coca-

Those with stubborn brand loyalties 
and no sense of adventure need not 
apply. Luckily, Ralphs is right next

though cash, check, credit and ATM 
cards are gladly accepted. Check out

Best Inttamural Sports Teams 
Coed: Innenube Water Polo 
It 's easy to see why this is the 

best coed intramural sport on cam-
pus: Men and women in bathing 
suits splashing around in a pool. As 
nice as this sounds, the game of 
innertube water polo is actually a 
fierce, competitive sport. 

Because of the use of innertubes 
as floatation devices, not as much 
action can occur underwater. This, 
however, does not prevent aquatic 
treachery, as tube-flipping and plen-
ty of arm wrestling occurs outside 
the referee's sightlines. 

If you're looking to get some 
exercise or just love water polo, give 
this one a try in the fall and spring 
quaners, when it's in season. The 
COS! is 53S per seven-person team. 

Men: Flag Football 
Flag football conjures up fond 

memories of childhood, calling out 
"alligators" before rushing the quar-
terback who is invariably looking at 
least 20 yards downfield for the long 
bomb. 

Forget it. 1M flag football at 
UCSD can be more brutal than an 
XFL playoff game, and the level of 
play can be extremely high. 

If you've played casually in the 
past, join a single or even a double-A 
team. If you think you can hang, join 
• triple-A tesm, but plan on practic-
ing your multiple defensive sets and 
pre-designed plays that you'll need to 
hive • chance. One last word of 
advice: Buy a mouthpiece. 

There are seven men per team 
and .the entry fee is 515 per squad. 

best club spon. 
The Squids and 

the Psychos - the men's and 
women's teams, respectively - are 
extremely popular, anti the game is 
fast-paced and exciting. 

And if you're looking for some 
"extracurricular activities" to go with 
your extracurricular activities, it is 
rumored that the team knows how to 
put on a decent shindig after a long 
game. 

If you're no! too confident on 
your disc-wielding skills, they even 
have teams for beginners and inter-
mediate players !o cut thei r teeth on . 

Best Recreation Class: Intro to 
Indoor Rock Climbing 

UCSD's indoor rock-climbing 
facility, the Outback Climbing 
Center, is located at the Canyonview 
Athletic Complex, and this class gives 
beginners a crash course in how to 
climb large, man-made rocks. 

Rock climbing can be a great 
form of stress relief, and you even get 
to wear funny shoes. lndoor rock 
climbing builds strength and coordi-
nation in a fun and safe environment. 
With Outback employees staffing the 
climbing facilities, there's little risk of 
becoming a pancake. 

The two-hour class costs $15 for 
students, and consists of one hour of 
instruction , and one hour of free 
climbing.

Best Commuter Lounge: Revelle 
College Commuter Lounge 

Libraries are great if you're look-
ing for a quiet place to do your chem 
homework, but they're not the most 
relaxing place to just chill out, and 
sleeping is frowned upon. 

If you have a couple of hours 
between classes and don't live on 
campus, a great place to relax is at 
one of the commuter lounges. The 
best is on the bottom floor of Blake 
Hall in Revelle Plaza right next to 
CLlCS. 

It has plenty of comfortable chairs 
and a television, so you can cbeclc the 
latest CNN reports and just unwind.

Best Dining Hall: Ocean View 
Terrace 

Thurgood Marshall college'S 
Ocean View Terrace isn 't usually con-
sidered one the top places to eat on 
campus, but after its recent renova-
tion, it is UCSD's best. 

It now has a coffee house lounge a 
la "Friends" and even lnternet-capa-
ble computers. The place is actually 
worth frequenting by more than 
starving Marshall donnrats. 

As its name suggests, there is an 
ocean view - which can be enjoyed 
from the patio that is now partially 
enclosed with plenry of windows. 
The new decor is pleasing to the eye, 
and the food is much improved. 

Of the new food options, the 
open-hearth fired pizza is the be t. 
They cook the e delicious, cheese-
smothered pies right before your 
eyes. OVT serves the classic dining 
hall fodder such as salads, sand·,vich-
es and food off the grill as well. 

If you have meal points, you 
should check out the new OVT at 
least once, even if you're not a 
Marsha II student. 

For more information including 
locations and hours of all on-campus 
dining facilities , visit the UCSD 
Housing & Dining Services Web site 
at http://hdm. ucsd.tdu. 

Best On-Campus Restrooms: 
AP&M, Price Center 

Let's be honest: The best place to 
do your business is at home, but 
unfortunately, sometimes that's just 
not feasible. Every so often, you 
have to drop anchor at school. 

The best men's bathroom is locat-
ed on the second floor of the Applied 
Physics and Mathematics building in 
Muir college. Always well-stocked 
with ample paper supplies, this fine 
faciliry also features a full-length 
mirror. Enjoy! _ 

The best women's bathroom is 
located on the second floor of the 
Price Center. Average in most 
respects, what sets this one apart is its 
dispenser of free feminine productsO. 
So if you're in a bind, you know 
where to go.

San Diego came alive 
at Street Scene 2001, the 
last great party of the sum-
lI1er. Thousands of people 

packed the Gaslamp District to 
dance, drink and listen. The vibe 
was simply wonderful. 

Street Scene and the Pacific 
Beach Block Party are the few times 

streets 
each year when the entire city of 
San Diego seems to flood the 
streets to have a good time and lis-

Street Scene 2001 included a

a few blocks, fans could find reggae

groups and DJs making the crowd 
dance. .

conspicuous corporate sponsorship
