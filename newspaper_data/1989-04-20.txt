Ramirez Wins A.S. 
Presidential Run-Off 

By REBEKAH YOUNG 
Staff Writer 

In a run-off election with an 
unusually high voter turnout , 
John Ramirez captured 53.5 per-
cent of the vote to defeat oppo-
nent John Robison for the office 
of A.S . president. 

For the second year in a row, 
the winner of the presidential 
election was not present when his 
name was called at the run-off 
result announcements. 

Ramirez said he was at home 
"preparing for the [Wednesday 
night] AS. meeting" when friends 
called to tell him he had won. 

Robison garnered 46.5 percent 
of the vote. 

The results were announced 
Wednesday night at the Price 
Center. With 1,772 students vot-
ing, the t~rnout was a record for a 
run-off election. Ele~tions tvfan-
ager Julia Ramirez said. 

"I knew it was going to be a 
close race," Ramirez said, "John 

R~' . -.raft a superb campaign. 
He's a very Intelligent individual 

~~~a1eg.ies constantly kept 
me on my toes," he added. 

Ramirez thought it was a diffi-
cult campaign for him and Robi-
son and said that the Guardian 
created "a lot of barriers for both 
of us." 

"I had an uphill battle because 
Robison got the [Guardian] en-
dorsement twice. I was told the 
endorsements are a really power-
ful thing and that if (didn't get the 
endorsement, my chances of win-
ning were slim unless I went all 
out," Ramirez. 

He added that Robison had to 
overcome the barrier of "the fra-
ternity issue."

Sigma Alpha Mu, the frater-
nity of which Robison is a

stripper for a rush event held in

Women's Resource Center Rally 

Election Day Speakers Assail Rush Event 
By RANDY DOTINGA 
Staff Writer 

During a rally on the hump in front of the 
Student Center yesterday, over 100 people 
gathered to hear speakers discuss a recent and 
controversial fraternity rush week event. 

The issue under fire was an April 7 oil 
wrestling event held at Peterson Hall under 
the sponsorship of the Sigma Alpha Mu fra-
ternity. The event was attended by some 200 
males and featured a female stripper. 

AS. presidential candidate and Sigma 
Alpha Mu member John Robison has been a 
focal point of public attention this past week 
as his attendance at, and knowledge of, his 
fraternity' rush event were questioned. 

Robison's name, however, was' not menti-
oned during the rally and Robison, comment-
ing on the election day speeche , said "('m 
very happy with the way the event went ." 

The rally, sponsored by the Women's 
Resource Center (WRC), began with a short 
speech by WRC member Lisa Cauble in 
which she emphasized that the rally was "not 
a political campaign," and thus not connected 
with the voting going on simultaneously on 
the gym steps. 

Cauble emphasized that the rally's purpose 
was to address the campus environment at 
UCSD that allowed the fraternity'S event to 
take place. 

"It i time that the UCSD environment be 
for everyone. The event took that environ-
ment away and made the situation one that 
oppresses people," she said. 

WRC member Patti Orozco commented 
she was "really bugged" by the Sigma Alpha 
Mu event. 

"Whenever you confront a ituation where 
another human being is being degraded in 
that way ... I think you need to stand up and 
confront that and talk out again tit," he 

said. 
"We want to put an end to the sort of 

environment that would condone such an 
event ... You have a right to say no to that 
kind of activity~" she concluded . 

Others at the rally were more outspoken in 
their criticism of the e"ent. 

"('m here as a female who's outraged ,"said 
Kay Ryon, Third College judicial chair. "It 
is a discouraging and pathetic commentary 
on the state of fraternal affair that alcohol or 
sexual exploitation are necessitie for a suc-
cessful rush event." 

She added that for a fraternity member to 
"vocalize age-old values of honor" and then 
hold such an event "show more than a lack of 
en itivity. Hypocrisy comes to mind." 

Gardner Grady, a graphic ani t who formed 
a new organization called Men topping 
Rape, spoke at the rally of his feelings a a 
man concerning the event.

utive board [of Sigma Alpha Mu] 
should have taken for the inci-
dent," Ramirez said. 

"( think a portion of the high 
voter turnout was due to outrage 
over the incident," said Alex 
Wong, the newly elected vice 
president administrative. 

Robison had no comment on 
the subject. 

The vice president external 
election results could not be 
announced, according to Julia 
Ramirez, because violations were 
filed against Mishka Migacz by 
Craig Peter and were not resolved

Migacz 
Accused of 
Election 
Violations 
By RANDY DOTINGA 
Staff Writer 

The results of the election race 
for the position of AS. vice presi-
dent external were unavailable 
yesterday, due to charges of elec-
tion bylaw violations being filed 
against candidate Mishka Migacz 
by her opponent Craig Peters. 

Three complaints were filed 
against Migacz, according to A. S. 
Elections Manager Julia Ramirez. 
The first was the alleged violation 
of Muir College posting rules. 

Under election bylaws, candi-
dates must follow the posting 
regulations of their respective col-
leges, Ramirez said . Migacz, 
Peters alleged, went door to door 
at Muir, violating Muir po ting 
laws prohibiting solicitation , 
Ramirez said. 

The second of Peters' com-
plaints accuses Migacz of not 
fully reporting campaign material 
he used . 

"Apparently he was using fly-
ers from [the first election] for the 
run-off that she did not file," 
Ramirez said. "According to the 
bylaws, you have to report every-
thing you use." 

The third complaint deals with 
Migacz's appearance at a 
Women's Resource Center raUy 
on the Student Center side of the 
.hump yesterday, while voting 
simultaneously took place on the 
Gym steps. 

Migacz did not refer to her 
campaign during her speech, but 
after introducing herself, read 
from a prepared text behind which 
she held a flyer , visible to the 
audience, which read "Vote for 
Mi hka." 

Ramirez said that, byannounc-
ing her name and showing the 
flyerto the audience, Migacz made 
her appearance political, and 
apparently broke several election 
bylaw .

Proposed UCSB Univ./Rec 
Center to Cost 553 Million 

SANTA BARBARA - The proposed University 
Center and Recreation Center expansion project at 
UCSB, if passed, would cost students at least $53 mil-
lion in additional fees over 31 years, as opposed to 
$19 million as stated in the UCSB Campus Elections 
Commission's voter's guide, the administration con-
firmed April 13. 

Additionally, there is no guarantee that the fees to 
fund the project will be terminated at the end of the 
3 I-year payment period, according to University Cen-
ter Director Alan Kirby. 

The elections commission is now evaluating its 
voter's guide, which was sent to students during the 
week of April 3. The guide misleadingly implies that 
both undergraduate and graduate students would pay 
only $19 million for the expansion of the University 
Center and the construction of a Recreation Center, 
Leslie Lawson, the Campus Elections Commission 
adviser and dean of students said. 

An additional $34 million would come from stu-
dent fees to cover the amount not disclosed to the 
students. This calculation i based on an enrollment 
of 18,000. Chancellor Barbara Uehling has announced 
plans to increase graduate enrollment by 2,000 by the 
year 2005. This increase would push student charges 
slightly over the $53 million amount.

UCLA On-Campus Residents to 
Face Fee Increases, Construction 

LOS ANGELES- Not only will next year' on-
campus housing residents at UCLA have to deal with 
construction inside and outside their buildings, but also 
with a substantial increase in their housing fees . 

All "Group A ~ hou ing, which includes all on-
campus undergraduate and graduate residence struc-
tures, will cost more next year. 

In the undergraduate residence halls, a two-person 
room will cost $4,40 I, an increase of nearly $700, and 
three-person rooms will cost $3,801 , an increase of over 
$400 from this year's fees. 

In Myra Hershey Hall, the graduate student resident 
hall , the cost of a double room will increase 18.4 percent 
to $4,380; a triple room's cost will increase 12.8 percent 
to $3,780. Four-person and six-person room prices will 
both rise 19.4 percent to $5,255 and $4,655, respectively. 

BLOOM COUNTY 
---------, 

Jack Gibbons, associate director of the Office of 
Residential Life, attributes the increases to three factors : 
inflation, program changes and seismic renovations. 

Next year's increases are more substantial than those 
of past years mostly because ofthe seismic renovations. 
Gibbons said. 

Business Enterprises, the department which oversees 
the university's business interests, is funding the renova-
tions with bonds that must -be repaid in 30 years. Those 
debts will be serviced with the revenue received through 
fee increases.

the ban of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade joined forces 
with volunteers from other countries to fight the 
armies of Franco, Hitler and Mussolini in the Spanish 
Civil War. 

"An American Ism," filmed in 1978, is a portrait 
about the making of America's foremost demagogue, 
Joseph McCarthy. McCarthy became one of the most 
feared and powerful politicians of the century when 
he exploited the "anti-communist issue" and the fear 
that stalked America in the post-war era. 

Both films will be shown Friday, April 28 in Third 
Lecture Hall 107. Admis ion i free.

MIGACZ 
Continued from page 1 

Bylaws that Migacz allegedly 
violated during her appearance at 
the rally include those that pro-
hibit the use of loudspeakers or 
bullhorns for campaigning with-
out A.S . Election Committee 
approval; prohibit the use of the 
Student Center or ASUCSD 
facilities . services. or equipment 
facilities for campaigning; and 
which require the cost of cam-
paign ' events to be reported, 
Ramirez said. 

According to Ramirez, an in-

formal hearing of Election Com-
mittee members was held yester-
day, at which "The formal recom-
mendation of the board was to 
make [Migacz) ineligible for the 
office because ... the informal 
board found the violations valid." 

Because Migacl did not accept 
the board's recommendation, the 
results of the election for vice pres-
ident external cannot be released 
until further inquiries are made, 
according to Ramirez. 

The next step in the process, 
Ramirez said, will be a formal 
inquiry by Election Committee 
members to be held in a few days.

NEWS 
If either Peters or Migacz do 

not agree with the findings of that 
board, they could appeal to the 
A.S. Judicial Board , Ramirez 
said . 

Peters had no comment con-
cerning his complaints against 
Migacz. Migacz maintains that 
the charges against her were 
"untrue" and said the complaints 
constitute "the only way [Peters] 
can insure winning, by filing viola-
tions against me that weren't true." 

Migacl went on to say that her 
soliciting for votes at Muir was 
approved by Muir Assistant Res-
ident Dean Kathie Poff. 

"She gave me sort of a 'yeah,' .. 
Migacl said of what she inter-
preted a PoWs approval, before 
explaining that "I talked to her [yes-
terday] and she said it wasn't a 'yes' 
or a 'no. 'It was sort of nebulous." 

Poff agreed that she had a con-
versation with Migacl, and said, 
"I know I didn't say 'no; and I 
know I didn't say 'yes.' I don't 
know that there was a conclusion 
to it." 

Migacz also said that she did 
turn in receipts for the flyers in 
question and maintains that her 
appearance at the rally was 
approved by Ramirez. 

Ramirezdenied Migacl's claim, 
saying, "I in no way approved of 
her going up there. I tried to avoid 
it. I told her if she did anything 
wrong, she was in jeopardy of 
disqualification. " 

Migacz also said that she did 
not "feel that the board is treating 
me fairly,"and said that she would 
pursue the matter as far as pos-
sible. 

"I'm not going to stop, because 
I know I'm not guilty. I followed 
procedures," she said.

Dear Ollie: 
... One of they many thing I have to be thankful for is the way in 

which you have performed under fire in tough situations. Your dedica-
tion to the hostage thing and Central America gives me cause for great 
pride. 

- George Bu h, Thank giving 1985, Postcard to Oliver onh 

S PIRO AGNEW WAS in court again la t week,and George Bush wasn't. They are both former vice presidents, but George has .a 
way with powerful people that Agnew never learned.. . . It IS 

mainly a matter of man over dumb, but it is al 0 a matter of lawyers. 
If Agnew had John Gotti' lawyer, he might be president today. 

And if George Bush had Brendan Sullivan for his personal attorney in 
the White Hou e, instead of C. Boyden Gray, he might be sleeping a lot 
easier on some of these troubled night . 

It was a crude little tax matter this time, but Agnew lost anyway. He 
i running the second-longest losing streak in American jurisprudence, 
behind the late Ted Bundy, and nobody can slow him down .... Spiro 
has an altitude, and it has taken him along way in this world, despite a 
record of shame, guilt and public humiliation in the coun , the Con-
gress and every other place where he has put his low-rent criminal oul 
up for judgment . 

Agnew has no shame, and it is hard to deal with people like that. In 
the latest episode, last Friday, a California state tax appeals board 

. ruled 5-0 against him for trying to collect a $24,197 refund on a bogus 
i tax deduction for repaying the state of Maryland $268,462 in coun-
ordered restitution, fines and interest stemming from criminal bribery 
charges from the good old days when he was governor of Maryland 
'and vice president of the United States. 

Agnew called it a deduction - like some routine charity gift to the 
Cranial Palsy Fou ndation or a business trip to Reno. The state Board 
of Equalization was horrified at his outburst of naked dumb greed. 

The same berserk greed got Agnew kicked out of Washington 16 
years ago when he was caught taking brown bags of cash under his desk 
in the vice president's office .... 

That was kickback money from Maryland highway contractors , 
routine bribes owed to Agnew from his recent term as governor of that 
state .. . . And he got huffy when people suggested impropriety in the 
spectacle of two-bit thugs a nd fixers from downtown ~alti~ore li~ed 
up in front of the vice president's office every mormng With soiled 
brown bags in their hands. 

N OT EVE IXON could stomach it. Agnew was cast adrift and eventually pleaded Nolo Contendere to charges of evading taxes on kickbacks totaling $147,500. 
Bribery charges were dropped, and Agnew was allowed to flee to 

Denver, where he signed on as road-man for Coors at three times the 
salary he was making (officially) as vice president. 

But that didn't last long. Coors put him up against the Miller Lite 
gang and blew about 1 I percent of the watery beer market. ... And 
then came that ugly little brute ofa dog from Bud Lite, who scooped up 
20 percent of the market in one year. .. . 

And that was the end of Spiro, as far as beer was concerned. He went 
to work for Arabs and arms dealers, but his work proved unsatisfac-
tory, and he was even dropped from "Who's Who." ... After that, he 
moved aimlessly about the country for a while, speaking extempo-
raneously to Rotary luncheons. 

Then he settled , like just another rich loser, in Rancho Mirage, Calif. 
- not far away from the Betty Ford Treatment Center fo( millionaire 
boozers and dope fiends. Gerald Ford, Agnew's successor as vice 
president (the man who eventually pardoned Nixon), lives just around 
the corner on Sand Dune Road. 

It is an attitude that seems to have been passed like a filthy torch 
from Agnew to Ford - and now to George Bush, as he stands before 
the camera, flanked by steely-eyed advisers and refusing to comment 
on Oliver North's charges that Bush, in the words of the ew York 
Times, "may have played a far more powerful role than he previously 
acknowledged in arranging aid to the contras." 

He was guilty of something: That has been clear all along. But 
nobody could say what it was . ... That is the history of George Bush's 
long and prosperous life in government service . His fingerprints are 
everywhere - from the oilfields of Texas to Beijing, working always 
for the hard bailers and war hawks - but his hands remain somehow 
clean. 

N OBODY CAN EXPLAIN it. but nobody really cared - until the Democrats tapped Michael Dukakis, perhaps their feeblest 
warrior, to go into the tank and generate a tidal wav~ of despair 

and confusion that caused George Bush to be elected preSident. 
Ah , memories, memories ... . It was Ed Meese, as J recall, who made 

the first public disclosure of what would come to be called the " Iran-
contra scandal." And it was Meese, la t week, who loosed the hounds 
of hell once again with his st raight-faced testimony at Nonh's trial that 
"higher-ups" were, indeed , involved from the very beginning. And 
nobody called him a liar th is time, either. 

"There are many cannons on the deck," as the Prophet Booar has 
said, a nd Ed Meese is definitely o ne of them. He has been babbling like 
a brook from the start .... But his testimony will be as that of a tree 
falling in the forest , unheard , co mpared to the hammer-and-tong 
symphony that Brendan Sullivan will be playing for Judge Gerhard 
Gesell as the Nonh trial co mes to crunch time. 

No more of that "Semper Fin busi ness. Ollie doesn't wear his uni-
form anymore. If Meese was a loose cannon, then Oliver Nonh is 
a loose tank . And he never really liked George Bush anyway.

Atkinson Does 
A Good Job 
Editor: 

First a disclaimer: from 1979 to 
1987 I was the assistant chancel-
lor here at UCSD and thus I have 
worked closely with Richard 
Atkinson since his appointment 
as chancellor in 1980. Setting aside 
as much as possible my own per-
sonal bias, 1 am reluctant to let 
the recent tudent referendum on 
the chancellor's suppon of the 
undergraduate program go un-
challenged. 

The outcome of the referen-
dum was as predictable as it wa 
unfortunate, and I fault the lead-
ership of the Associated Students 
for causing such a clearly foolish 
exercise to go forward . Students 
have an important obligation to 
speak thoughtfully about the 
administration of the campus; 
such a fri volous u e of the refer-
endum process diminishes its 
future effectiveness . 

'The outcome of the ref-
erendum was as predic-
table as it was unfortu-
nate .... ' 

I find it particularly puzzling 
that neither the leadership of the 
Associated Students nor the 
Guardian sought to confer with 
the chancellor about the issues, 
such as they were, that were in 
dispute. Surely the eight prior 
presidents of the Associated Stu-
dents, all of who I know worked 
effectively with Chancellor At~nÂ­
son, will be astonished and dis-
mayed to see such a turn of 
events. 

In my view, one which is widely 
held by faculty, staff, and know-
ledgable students, Chancellor 
Atkinson has worked very hard 
to improve all aspects of the Uni-
ver ity; including its undergradu-
ate programs. He has increased 
the number of scholarships for 
undergraduates, added recreation-
al facilities and housing, and, most 
of all, recruited many outstanding 
faculty. The referendum was a 
sorry co mmentary, not on the 
chancellor, but on the leade rship 
of the Associated Students.

New Pub Is Poorly Located 
Editor: 

With the Grand Opening of the 
Price Center beginning this week, 
I decided I should take a look 
around this multi-million dollar 
facility . After receiving a map 
from the Price Center Board, I 
was appalled to learn that the 
room behind the Price Center 
Auditorium is the new Pub . . 
Except for the rest rooms between 
them, it seems the 480-student 
classroom is next to an alcoholic 
establishment. Not only that, but 
the designated outdoor area for 

Round Table faces Central Li-
brary. It is hard for me, a senior, 
to believe that the UC Admin-
istration, which strongly believes 
that UCSD should be a dry cam-
pus, would allow an establish-
ment which serves alcohol to be in 
the same building as a classroom. 

It would also appear that the 
Administration is openly display-
ing to the public that a bar, which 
will probably sponsor bands, is 
an "OK" neighbor for Central 
Library. As some students prob-

Galbraith, HL Confusion 
Editor: 

Since the renaming of Huma-
nities / Undergraduate Library 
building as Galbraith Hall a few 
weeks ago, the UCSD Guardian 
several times has referred incor-
rectly to the Undergraduate Li-
brary as Galbraith Hall, including 
the article reporting the name 
change. 

Please be aware that the build-
ing is Galbraith Hall and the 
library remains the Undergradu-

ate Library, as it has been for 
some time now. Perhaps in time 
the building renaming will also ' 
reduce confusion between what 
formerly was the Humanities / Li-
brary Building (HL) and incor-
rect references to the library as 
Humanities Library (HL).

OPINION 

Election 
Confusion 
Editor: 

Like ma ny graduate tudents , 
I did not vote in the recent cam-
pus election because I assumed 
that only undergraduates could 
vote. Only when it was too late 
did 1 find out that we were in fact 
allowed to vote on the co-op 
referendum. 

1 am very disappointed that 
the Guardian presented the elec-

lion as a strictly undergraduate 
affair. Even the large display ad 
said to vote "At Your College," 
which would seem to exclude 
grad uate students. 

In the future, please remember 
that the paper is read by the 
entire campus community, and 
pre-election coverage must indi-
cate clearly who is allowed to 
vote.

Progress Leaves Health Center Behind 
Editor: 

Ask any fifth year senior (like myself) , " What 
was UCSD like when you were a freshman?" The 
response would probably be something like this : 
"You were bummed if you got to school and had 
to park towards the back of the Revelle lot and 
the only lines were the ones leading into the 
cafeteria right around lunchtime." 

U CS D has come a long way since then, putting 
itself on the map as a top notch university in all 
areas. This has made UCSD a more attractive 
university, which has caused rapid expansion. 
But in order for expansion to be successful, 
growth needs progress, and progress needs good 
management. 

One area where expansion has been non-
existent and has made little or no progress is in 
the Student Health Center. I ay this because for 
five years now, I have gone to the Student Health 
Center on a monthly basis for allergy shots. I 
have seen the Student Health Center go from a 
smooth running building to an under-staffed , 
over-<lemanded, poorly managed center. In 1984, 
I could walk in anytime, get my shots, and leave. 
This was especially convenient since timeliness of 

Make up to

meeting. 

the injections is important. 
Now, I go in and if 1 don't make an appoint-

ment a month in advance, 1 might not find a spot 
to get squeezed into. This is due to the increase in 
University popUlation which has gone up from 
12,000 people in 1984 to 18,000 people in 1989. 
Consequently, registration fees have increased 
from$170to$195from 1984to 1989. There is an 
increase in population (demand) with increased 
funds; however, I notice no increase in facility nor 
staff. This makes no sense. 

There was one nurse that gave allergy injec-
tions when 1 was a fres~man and that same nurse 
is the only one on staff giving them today. My 
waiting times (yes, even with the new computer-
ized appointment scheduling) has increased so 
much that] almost desire getting the shots some-
where else due to the inefficiency that plagues the 
Student Health Center. 

It appears the same number of doctors and 
nurses service the increased load of students. 
Where has all the money gone?

992 Activists Arrested in Nevada 
Nuclear Test Site Demonstration 

Four UCSD Students Participate, Three Arrested 
By JULIE MUNRO 
Features Editor 

Four UCSD students partici-
pated in a protest at the nation's 
nuclear testing grounds in Ne-
vada during which 992 activists 
were arrested on misdemeanor 
trespass charges by Saturday 
evening. 

When Kel Shields, one of the 
UCSD students, told some of her 
friends she would be involved in 
the demonstration, their reaction 
"was really horrible," she said. 

"Some people laughed," she 
explained, while others warned 
her that she may jeopardize her 
chances of being accepted into 

law school. "The apathy [at 
UCSD] really makes me sad," she 
said. 

A group called American Peace 
Test (APT) organized the annual 
demonstration which is attended 
by people with a number of often 
interrelated interests. The organi-
zation published a 30 page "Hand-
book" which outlined events, set 
guidelines for "nonviolent direct 
action," and described a number 
of APT causes. 

The publication stated, "No 
more testing means the beginning 
of the end of the nuclear arms 
race ... more tax dollars for the 
homeless, hungry, women, child-
ren, AIDS research ... an end to 
poisoning those affected by air-
borne radiation ... [and] the Sho-

shone land ... may one day be 
restored ... 

Shields went to Nevada aware 
that more extreme measures could 
be taken, but she was simply 
arrested and released the same 
afternoon. "Nothing is on my 
record," she said . 

The experience made her feel 
"empowered" because although 
"they're not going to remember 
my name in Washington, the 
numbers are what count." She 
wants them to remember her as 
one of 992 people arrested to 
make a statement. 

What was that statement? 
Shields said she is "probably more 
environmentally conscious than 
socially conscious," but that she 
certainly sympathizes with Sho-
shone people who once lived on 
the land now occupied by the 
Nevada Test Site. 

Another UCSD student, Heidi 
Mitchem, explained that a conch 
shell was blown Saturday after-
noon to signal the protesters to 
begin their "mass action." They 
crossed a barbed wire fence, which 
borders the test site property, and 
peacefully held out their wrists to 
be handcuffed when law officers 
apprehended them, Mitchem said . 
Some activists traveled around to 
the back of the test site Friday 
night and crossed the property 
line in more remote locations. 

The activists carried this mock Pershing" missile onto the test site. 

The law officers guarded the 
area in helicopters and dune bug-
gies, as well as on foot, according 
to Mitchem. More than lOOoffic-
ers were brought to the Nevada 
Test Site for this annual "Reclaim 
the Test Site" protest. 

Mitchem was initially hand-
cuffed to a group of people who 
waited together on the site until 
they were put in "holding pens." 
The demonstrators were then 
transported in 13 or so buses to a 
high school 55 miles away where 
they were held for the rest of the 
afternoon. 

They were takÂ«n away from 
tbe site to prevent them from 
returning and allowi ng themselves 
to be arrested a second (or third) 
time. Mitchem said. 

Earlier this month, Nye County 
officials announced that trespass-
ers would no Ipnger be prose-
cuted because of the growing 
number of protests and arrests at 
the testing site. A total of 2,818 
arrests were reported last year. 

A rally objecting to the use of 
59 percent of 1988 income tax 
dollars for current and past mil-
itary costs preceded Saturday's 
demonstration of civil disobedi-
ence. It was one of the last events 
of a 10 day protest , which ended 
Sunday. 

An estimated 1,500 people 
gathered at the site for Saturday'S 
rally. Some of the demonstrators 
who did not cross the fence sat in 
the road to block vehicles. 

Sinfe 1981 , there have been 
92,000 reported cases of Acquired 
Immune Deficiency Syndrome 
(AID ). California alone has 
17,805 reported cases of AIDS 
and Human Immunodeficiency 
Virus ( HIV). According to the 
San Diego AIDS Project infor-
mation sheet, 60 percent of the 
people infected with the virus 
have died . 

A group called the AIDS Task 
Force was established on campus 
in the spring of 1987. This organi-
zatio n provides people with 
updated information about the 
AIDS virus. Their main goal is to 
"conduct and coordinate AIDS 
education," said Christine Oak-
ley, M.P.H .. Oakleyisthepatiern 
services manager at the Student 
Health Center and a member of 
the AIDS Task Force. 

Peter Messroblan/ Guordian 
Christine Oakley said a lot of 
AIDS cases go unreported. 

Excavation of Temple Prompts Look at 
Israelites' Journey to Promised Land 

The AIDS Task Force consists 
of 36 members, including faculty 
and students. The group spon-
sors various activities to inform 
students about this disease. 

In the fail of 1987 and 1988, the 
organization put together an 
AIDS Awareness Week and sup-
ported Condom Awareness Day. 

They have made resource ma-
terials a vailable by putting to-
gether brochures and a video 
called Sex planations. The video, 
directed and performed by stu-
dents, shows how students should 
confront their partners about safe 
sex. 

According to Oakley, the task 
force wants to "create a sensitive 
atmosphere that's supportive and 
informed about [AIDS] issues." 
The Task Force continues to train 
and educate its staff with current 
information. 

They " design and update 
student-targeted AIDS education 
programs, develop a media plan 
for AIDS awareness, investigate 
alternative funding, continuc net-
working with other UCjCSU 
AIDS education programs, and 
serve as liaison to the Student 
Health Service for AIDS infor-
mation, referral updates , and ser-
vice recommendations," as stated 
on the list of goals of the AIDS 
Task Force for 1988-89. 

So far , the group has received a 
great deal of support from every-

one and every department at 
UCSD. The libraries offer display 
tables for the AIDS brochures 
and every department "was more 
than helpful in distributing in-
form'ation," Oakley stated . The 
AIDSTask Force also has a good 
working relationship with the A.S. 

According to the "General 
Statement on Institutional Re-
sponse to AIDS Revised January 
1988," written by Richltrd Keel-
ing, M.D., chairperson ofthe Task 
Force on AIDS American Col-
lege Health Association, "It is 
important to recognize and ad-
dress the rich diversity of people 
in the campus community and to 
provide opportunities for effec-
tive learning by people of any age, 
ability. gender, ethnicity, or sex-
ual orientation." Oakley feels the 
campus task force has managed 
to keep the UCSD campus in-
formed , but said they still hope 
for more student involvement. 

Since 1981 , San Diego has 
reported a total of 1,177 cases. 
"These are conservative figures," 
Oakley said, because a lot of cases 
go unreported and the number of 
infected individuals on campus is 
unknown. UCSD does not have 
any known policies for people 
infected with AIDS or HIV. 

I n his brochure about the insti-
tutional response to AIDS, Keel-
ing acknowledges there are guide-
lines for institutional policy given 
by the American College Health 
Association . One policy stated 
that "no institution of higher 
learning should include consider-
ation of the existence of any form 
of HIV infection in the initial 
admission of people applying to

Were the Israelites slaves in 
Egypt? Was there a Moses, and 
did he lead his people to freedom? 

People filled UCSD's Liebow 
Auditorium Monday night to hear 
Dr. Eliezer Oren address these 
questions. He discussed the Bibli-
cal Exodus story, Sinai, and recent 
archeological discoveries. 

Oren, a visiting professor from 
Ben-Gurion University of the 
Negev in Israel , delivered the third 
of the 1989 Yigal Shiloh Memor-
ial Lectures, sponsored by 
UCSD's Judaic Studies Program. 
Between 1970 and 1982, Oren 
directed the Ben-Gurion expedi-
tions to the Northern part of the 
Sinai desert . These expeditions 
excavated over 1,300 settlements. 

Professor Oren began by dis-
cussing the Exodus, the Biblical 
story of the Israelites' journey from 
Egyptian captivity to the Prom-
ised Land . He noted his lecture 
fell only two days before Pass-
over, a festival commemorating 
the deliverance from Egypt. 

The exodus of the Hebrews is 
the central issue in the ancient his-
tory of Israel, Oren explained. It 
is a symbol marking the freedom 
from slavery in Egypt. 

" It's a theological axis, not a 
hi~torical one," he said. "So far, 
no direct evidence for the event 
can be found outside of the Bible."

matic issue in the Bible," he con-
tinued, with theories ranging the 
spectrum from complete accep-
tance of the account to utter 
rejection. 

One problem with proving the 
historicity of the event, he said, is 
that "We mis anchors - histori-
cal, archeological , geographical." 
None of the numerous Egyptian 
documents which have been un-
earthed mention the event. The 
Pharoah in the story is unnamed , 
and the names of many place in

the story are symbolic, not geo-
graphical. 

"There is no agreement even on 
the location of Mount Sinai - or 
the name of Mount Sinai," he 
said. 

It is difficult to reconstruct the 
Exodus even in the basis of the 
literary account, due to parallel 
and sometimes conflicting ac-
counts within the text. He sug-
gests the account is made up of 
different traditions, taking place

Oren noted , and had a system of

tected bases. 

Scarabs were found, "repres-

site, some scholars believe, is the 
logical place to find the temple of 
Baal-Zephon, a place mentioned 
in Exodus. 

Oren discussed a wealth of dis-
coveries, representing all major 
activities of Egyptian life in the 
area. 

"This was not just ... a high-
way," he said , but a belt of settle-
ments that was almost self-sus-
taining. Enough foundations of 
the mil itary forts were discovered 
to make fairly accurate recon-
structions of the buildings. 

"Who manned the bases?" he 
asked . Analyzing some 26 burial 
sites, they found no Egyptian 
bodies. Maintaining the bases, it 
seem , was left in the hands of the 
local people, who adopted Egyp-
tian customs. "It was a two-way 
interaction between Canaan and 
Egypt. .. 

"We're dealing with a pheno-
menon, rather than a major 
event," Oren said. "Movement 
between Egypt and Canaan was 
not a unique phenomenon, as is 
corroborated by historical refer-
ences." If a nation escaped from 
Egypt, he added, it was probably 
in smah groups over a long period 
of time. 

One fascinating excavation, 
done shortly before the Sinai 
region was returned to Egypt, 
examined an ancient temple. The 

The expedition was pressed for 
time. Oren said, and the work 
seemed impossible. 

"Have you ever tried to exca-
vate the bottom of a sand dune, 
without touching the top?" Oren 
laughed. Yet they found evidence 
that the temple would not be 
dated earlier than the fifth century 
B.C., when the Persian Empire 
controlled the area. If the temple 
is indeed the Baal-Zephon temple 
mentioned in the Bible, this find 
would place the Exodus much 

In the Eastern delta area, work-
ing with geologists, they found 
the natural course of the eastern-
most arm of the Nile river -
which scholars had tried for cen-
turies to locate. They also found a 
man-made canal, a major engi-
neering project, going toward the 
Egyptian kingdom. The canal's 
location matches references found 
in Egyptian records. 

Water reservoirs, kilns, and 
granaries were unearthed. Some 
granaries contained measuring 
cups, " excellent examples of 
Egyptian pottery," Oren said, and 
fragments of carbonized grain . 
Botanical analysis showed that 
the grains came from the Gaza 
area, ratherthan the Eastern delta, 
as might have been expected. 

They reburied every completely 
excavated site, Oren said, "fo pro-
tect it from the harsh elements -
nature as well as human. One day, 
perhaps, it will be possible to 
reopen [them]." 

Over eighty military bases were 
explored , from the Suez Canal to 
the Gaza area. Major armies

The West Coast Premiere of the restored English classic 
The Life & Death of Colonel Blimp. Originally sup-
pressed by the British government, Powell 's first film has 
finally been restored to its original running time and 
Technicolor. Based on David Low's cartoon character, 
Blimp, traces the war-time history of one English soldier 
through both world wars. We see him change from a 
young enthusiastic soldier to an older, doubting and self-
tortured man. The film contradicts and cuts down the 
often glorified and romantic vision of war, which is what 

caused the British government to censor 
this negative patriotism.

chure advises college to admit 
people with the HlV infection 
depending on their physical and 
mental ability. 

According to current medical 
information, people sharing re i-
dence with a person infected with 
the virus are not at any risk. Keel-
ing and Oakley both mentioned 
that it is the person with the 
immune deficiency that is more at 
risk because he / she is more sus-
ceptible to contagiou diseases, 
such as the measles or chicken 
pox. 

An individual who is suspected 
of being expo ed to the virus. 
should eek HIV te ting either at 
the Student Health Center or any

Oakley said. The testing sights in 
the community are usually free. 
Counseling is offered before and 
after the tests . The purpo e of 
counseling i to tell people what 
the test revealed and help them 
deal with the results. 

Oakley feels that the biggest 
student misconception about

never happen to them.

not susceptible to anything," Oak-

University Center Director 
Jim Corruther. ,uggested that 
the logo should Incorporate

steps and acoustical tiling are 
the most prominently 
displayed.

of the University population, if H is to genuinely become the 'soclal and cultural heart of

give everyone in the University family a reason for coming to the Center." 

THE 
BIG 
CAKE 

by mike martinez 
contrtbutlng wrtter 

There is an unmistakable bigness to this occasion. It's been over 
five years in the making, it's 167,000 square feet in size, and it cost 
$19.4 million. 

Its name honors Sol Price, whose family has endowed $2 million 
in probably the biggest contribution of its kind ever ... that is, to an 
educational institution for non-academic construction. 

When its new bookstore opens, it will be one of the biggest in the 
state. And anyone who shows up at the Ballroom tomorrow at 1 :30 can 
share a cake specially prepared for 5,000 close friends. This is a big 
cake. 

Unless you neither read nor listen to legends, you know it's show-
time. The Price Center, UCSD's mega center for cultural, social, and 
intellectual pursuits, is now open. You may not find all the 
facilities in working fashion, mbst notably the bookstore. But most of 
the food vendors are scheduled to be cookin ', and the Ballroom is 
ready to stage a series of Grand Opening events (see schedule of 
events this page). This Price Center sure knows how to throw a party. 

ThiS is the big payoff for men like Jim Carruthers, the director of the 
University Center, and Tom Tucker, assistant vice chancellor of 
undergraduate affairs. Tucker's been around so long that it's been 
nearly forgotten that he came here primarily to build this thing. 
Players like these have Shown how hard work and politicking get the 
job done. The completion of the Price Center is, in terms of one's 
career, the stuff of highlight films. 

Most of all, this is a triumph for the students of this campus. Carruth-
ers and Tucker are, after all, advisors. The main governing board of the 
Price Center is the University Center Board (UCB), and 10 of its 15 
positions are held by students. The final product is largely what the 
students want. 

1HI .0 PIC1'UB 
Over five years ago, in October of 1983, a marketing survey was 

done on campus to find out if there was interest in a new Student 
Center and what types of services and facilities it should offer. 
Students responded with a wide-ranging list of needs: lounges in 
which to relax or study; an information center to tell you what, where, 
and when; fast service restaurants with a variety of fares (at eco-
nomic prices) ; a theatre; and, other functional services like a post 
office, computer center, and copy center. 

The survey presented an interesting concept-a self-contained 
city within the campus. UCSD's growth had made its present Student 
Center facilities woefully inadequate. 

The University Center Programming Building Advisory Committee 
was subsequently formed to work with the University Center Board. 
Subcommittees led by students met to identify needs, consider loca-
tions, and solve logistics. Through referendum in May' of 1984, stu-
dents voted in a $25 per quarter hike in fees to help fund a center. 

Nearly all of the facilities named in that initial survey and more will 
be found in the Price Center when full operation is underway. 

-A "philosophical statemenf' from the University Center Board. 

1'HI1i0 .DOI â¢â¢ ea WAR 
Part of the marketing survey conducted back in '83 asked students 

what types of food they would like to see served in the Center. The 
most overwhelming mandate was for a pizza and beer pub, but the 
cultural mix of the campus was reflected in the other contenders 
-Mexican, Chinese, a deli, ice cream shop, and coffeehouse. In 
some cases, the responses were even specific with regard to brand 
loyalty. 

The UCB had its own considerations in addition to what its demo-
graphics revealed . A subcommittee was formed to deal with the food 
question, and they initiated a bidding auction for space rental in the 
Center's food plaza. With a potential audience of 30,000 consumers, it 
was a seller's market. The auction was announced in trade papers 
and the Los Angeles Times. Candidates had to meet criteria regarding ' 
the amount of liability insurance they were willing to provide, ingre-
dients of its product, and other considerations. At one point, a taste 
testing panel convened. 

The final winners were Wendy's, Chung King Loh, Zip's Tummy 
Buster, Espresso Roma, A Taste Of The Past ice cream, and Round 
Table Pizza. 

One notable loser was the Triton Pub, an institution on campus 
noted for its genial atmosphere and diverse clientele. Pub manager 
Maryanne Davis abstained from the bidding, refusing to compete in 
1he boardroom with corporate franchises. Since California law allows 
only one liquor license on campus, the Triton Pub has passed into 
folklore. It's space is now available for rent. 

THlIIGIIIW 
Amidst the symmetry of its intentions and the beauty of its realiza-

tion, one jarring note sounds a dull thud in the Price Center saga. 
Architecture. 
Asked to describe it, Price Center logo designer Frankie Frey (who 

used an aerial photo and architect's model in her innovative design) 
generously summed it up as a "conservative version of a post-modern 
feeL" 

Ken Kaiser, the San Diego Union's Architecture Critic, was not as 
kind . He described the Center's cacophony of zigs and zags as "the 
architectural equivalent of the two-headed dog in an itinerant gypsy 
carnival ... the design's stew includes ... Hispanic design ... layered 
masonry ... for a little Pacific Rim spice, pour Shoji screenwork over 
the windows. " 

Perhaps the architects, Kaplan/McLaughlin /Diaz, took into con-
sideration the multi-cultural mix of the campus' varied newsmakers 
and the campus' existing mixture of styles. 

There are the riotproof concrete towers of Muir and the NASA-style 
pillars of Revelle. There are the beige stuccos of Third and the Quonset 
motif of Warren. Central Library is expanding underground. Now the 
Price Center. 

Last November, the UCSD faculty senate approved a master plan 
that would strive to preserve the Individual identities of the campus

NORDSTROM 
by marel aronoYltz 

hiatus wrtter 
As I wind down the maze of cement into the new Price 

Center, I am anticipating my response to what has been 
so long in the making. From above I can see the green 
awnings labeled to indi.::ate the services beneath. The awn-
ings match the banisters lining the building. I am reminded of 
a shopping mall. 

The windows are also tinted green and have been cut 
sharply into geometrical shapes. I am confused. 

I want to like this new Center that I have been hearing 
about and envisioning for what seems like my entire college 
career, but I am not sure I feel like I am at college anymor~. 

I make it to the center of the outside courtyard. Th~ 
circular structure of the courtyard has the potential to draw 
people together. The many comfortable tables are empty 
now. 

In the background, I can hear the fountain. It adds an air of 
relaxation to the place, taking me away from my academic 
concerns. I like the idea of a universal hangout for UCSD 
which so often seems segregated by the different colleges. 

I walk through a big glass door with a big plastic white 
handle. I am in "building four, level one." The names of 
places are very matter-ol-fact. The inside is colored with 
cool shades of purple, blue and green. There are plenty of 
couches and chairs in the lounge area outside the main 
rooms. 

The furniture is comfortable but the cool colors and 
manner are formally spaced. The atmosphere is superficial. 
There is no diversity in color scheme or structure throughout 
the buildings. It is nice like the ladies lounge in Nordstrom is 
nice. 

I realize that getting from one building to the next is a small 
chore. There are different buildings, sets of stairs, and circu-
lar corridors to travel through in order to get from one place 
to the next. In spite of this slight obstacle, I wandered through 
all of the buildings. 

Much of the Price Center consists of offices. Walking 
down stuffy hallways of closed office doors is discouraging 
to me. I had hoped for large casual rooms with everything 
happening in the same sphere, adding a dimension of social 
life to the campus. 

I look around and watch people walk through the Center. 
They walk slowly, looking around. Everyone is curious. I hear 
people say they like it ("it's pretty") and others say they don't 
("it's ugly and impersonaL") 

Things are still unfinished and not much has actually 
opened up. Maybe the presence of students will bring life to 
the place. 

I stand outside and look again at the beige building deco-
rated with aqua green. The building is very expensive. The 
exterior of the building, around the outside, is sharp and 
blockish. Although it is intriguing, I just hope it is inviting.

Say Anything 
Says Too Much 

by nancy m untner 
hiatul ltaff writer 

Have you ever seen a novice juggle? Usually the person has too many 
things in the air at once and ends up dropping everything. Cameron 
Crowe, the writer and first-time director of the new film Sa)' An)'thinl!, 
seems to have had the same problem. Sa)' An)'thing is a choppy, disor-
ganized, and unrealistic attempt at a poignant love story. 

It is difficult to identify one singular plot in this film. First and 
foremost, I guess it is the story of Lloyd Oohn Cusack) and Diane (lone 
Skye). He is the non-conformist high school graduate who plans a 
career in kick boxing. She is the brilliant student who won a fellowship 
to England. Together they make your typical mismatched couple. You 
can hypothesize on whether they end up together or not . . 

The second main storyline is between Diane and her father, James 
Court Oohn Mahoney). Mr. Court wants everything for his daughter, 
almost to the point of frenzy. Diane and her father have an extremely 
close relationship. So close, in fact, that she can "say anything" to him. 
In the course of the movie, however, Diane learns the hard truth that her 
dad has not necessarily said everything there is to say. 

Subplots are numerous. Lili Taylor (from M),stic Pitta) plays Lloyd's 
friend Corey. At one point someone mentions once that Corey tried to 
commit suicide. This is never brought up again. 

Another minor relationship is between Lloyd and his sister, played 
by his real-life sister Joan Cusack (Working Girl). The two have one 
scene together. some issues are raised, and we almost never see the sister 
again. My guess is that she ended up on the cutting room floor, along 
with a lot of other material. 

This film just had too many things going on, and not enough atten~ 
tion was given to any single aspect. As a result , all of the characters are 
just caricatures, and the stories mere sketches. Though we are told that 
Lloyd and Diane share a strong bond of love, the movie never shows 
them having a conversation. Basically we see him trying to teach her 
how to drive a car (cute stuff), a few kissing scenes, and that's it. There is 
absolutely no relationship development. 

Furthermore, characters (like Diane's mother and Lloyd's sister) 
appear and disappear semmingly at random intervals. If the filmmakers 
had chosen one storyline and stuck with it, the film might have worked. 
But as it is, it's a jumble. 

There were. I admit, a couple of funny scenes, worthy of a few laughs. 
The film had potential. John Cusack did what he could with the role of

Joke Still Kills 
by sascha ogint 

hiatus senior staff writer 

The Killing Joke concert at the Bacchanal on Thursday night 
would have been better if there hadn't been such vigilant security. 
That type of band lends itself to crowding and shoving. The 
energy of the music can't be fully appreciated if the energy of the 
crowd can't take off a little bit. Although the concert was by no 
means sold out, the number of bouncers was high, and the 
number of people that got kicked out was higher. The slightest 
sideways shove was enough to get a male kicked out, and a female 
a warning glare. 

Despite the security problems, the show was impressive. The 
lead singer, who came on in gari h black and red face paint, was 
feverishly intense. Along with recent work, the band played a lot 
of songs from about five years ago, when they were more popular. 
Perha ps the music itself was not 0 compelling as the fervor of the 
band in the way they played it. Sometimes you need to see a live 
show to understand what a band is all about. I went to the show 
feeling that KillingJoke was good and came away feeling that they 
were exceptional.

You walk into the Piranha

28 in the brand new Price Center Ballroom. The winner of this 
week's qUIz will Win a pair of tickets to the show. In the event of a 
tie, one name will be drawn at random. As usual, please send all 
answers to the Qunrdlan Office by Monday at 3 p.m. and include 
your name, address, phone number, and major. 

This week's quiz is dedicated to upcoming concerts: 
1) The Beat Farmers hail from what major U.S. city? 
2) The Replacements' current line-up has one tlifferent member 
than when it started. Who is the newest member, and who did he 
replace? 
3) How many fulllengrh albums did Soft Cell release? 
4) What famous artist was a driving force behind the Velvet 
Underground? 
5) jane's Addiction played at what historical LA hotel this past 
New Year's Eve? 

Last week's winner is Brent Stahl. Brent pick up your free 
album with Mark Neiter at KSDT. The answers were: 
1) Iggy Pop 
2) Rick Rubin 
3) Southern Death Cult; Death Cult 
4) Born to be Wild 

tailored shirts, and the occasional 
skirt. A black motorcycle jacket 
(painted on back) and Bauhaus 
T-shirt are also recurring themes. 

Style is a vital element, those 
without it are clearly ostracized. 
For example, groups of men wear-
ing white Team Pesky tank tops, 
jeans, and cowboy boots receive a 
lot of rude glances. 

Musical knowlege is another 
topic of great importance. DJs 
Jim and Voodoo play true cutting 
edge music such as Ministry, Niner 
Ebb, Wolfgang Press, Jane's Ad-
diction, the Ramones, Bauhaus, 
Tones on Tail, and Front 242. 
(This music is unlike the "cutting 
edge" music that a certain radio 
station claims to play). 

All the Piranha Room regulars 
are understandably avid about the 
club because of the music. Though 
the majority of it does not receive 
attention on the radio, these peo-
ple know and love it. The club is 
addictive because it's essentially 
the only place where truly alterna-
tive music can be heard in a club 
atmosphere. Going every week is 
like getting a fix of your favorite 
drug. 

The energy on the dance floor is 
indescribable. Some people dance 
exhibltionally on platforms, oth-
ers take more unassuming posi-
tions on the dance floor. Above 
all there is a feeling of intense 
cathartic pleasure that comes from 
dancing here. 

Partners are not necessary, and 
it's not really hip to ask someone 
to dance. The most important 
thing is to dance when you feel 
like it, and to get into it. 

Adding to the atmosphere is 
Voodoo's charismatic presence o n 
the mic. Depending on your atti-
tude, he'll either make you feel 
like you're part of an exclusive 
club, or a complete misfit. His 
comments are always laced with

Almond Brings tLa Magia' To San Diego 
by lalTV weintraub 

hiatus music editor 

What do you think of when 
you hear the song, "Tainted 
Love?" It probably reminds you 
of your high school prom, your 
cousin's Bar Mitzvah, or any 
Tijuana discotheque. 

That's because "Tainted Love" 
is by far the most requested dance 
song this generation can boast. So 
why is "Tainted Love" suddenly 

receiving so much radio airplay 
years after its release? 

No, it's not to celebrate a new 
album by the song's creators, Soft 
Cell. In fact, Soft Cell hasn't 
recorded in over five years , The 
reason " Tainted Love" is being 
played so often is to announce the 
song's co-writer, Marc Almond, is 
coming to town. 

Currently engaged in his first 
world tour, Almond will bring his 
"La Magia" tour to San Diego's 

Marc Almond plays California Theatre Sunday night. 

California Theatre Sunday night. 
The tour is in support of The Stars 
We Are, Almond's latest and most 
commercial effort since his days in 
Soft Cell. 

Though he hasn't recorded as 
Soft Cell with partner Dave Ball 
since they parted in 1984, Almond 
has managed to keep himself 
extremely busy. He has recorded 
numerous albums for several dif-
ferent record companies, churn-
ing out some very diverse music 
each time. He's even gone so far as 
to record an album of other peo-
ple's music which he considers his 
specialty. Each of these, however, 
has failed to gain him the popular 
acclaim he enjoyed while with 
Soft Cell. 

CI 
After his last album, Mocher FiJI 

and Her Fit'e Daughters failed to 
impress anyone but the critics, 
Almond found himself once again 
without a record company. 
Almond spent much of this time 
experimenting with poetty read to 
music, and collaborating with 
other noted artists such as Bronski 
Beat, Matt Johnson (of The The) 
and Nick Cave. 

In 1988, Almond released his 
first book, a collection o f songs 
and poetty entitled, The Angel of 
Death in lhe Adonis Lounge. 1988 
also found Almond releasing his 
first album for Capitol-EM I 
Records, the current, The Stars 
We Are. 

On The Stars W e Are Almond 

c 

covers some very romantic and 
exotic territory. Most notable are 
the catchy "Tears Run Rings" and 
the eerie "Your Kisses Burn" a 
duet with '60s icon Nico (the last 
recording before her death). 

The tour, called "La Magia" 
after Almond's band, is being 
billed as somewhat of a spectacle. 
Playing exclusively in theatre-style 
venues in only select U.S. cities, 
Almond's show will employ an 
array of lighting and visual effects. 

When Marc Almond takes the 
stage on Sunday night, many will 
be expecting to hear the old and 
many will want the new. By com-
bining the two, San Diego will be 
tteated to a rare and exquisite per-
formance from a man who defines 
the term artist.

Vinyl's Slow Demise

..utant am editOl' 

Whether you like it or not, it is becoming more and more 
difficult to deny that vinyl albums are dying. It's been a slow death 
over the last few years, but one which has been realized (and for 
the most part accepted) by those in the music industty. 

"I assume the death knell has been sounded and there 's not 
much we can do about it," says Joe Smith, president of Capitol 
Music-EM!. 

"It's just a question of timing," adds Bob Sherwood, senior . 
vice president of Columbia Records. 

Though no one can agree as to when vinyl LPs will finally find a 
place next to eight-track tapes in music medium heaven, both 
manufacturers and retailers seem to think it will be sooner than 
later. 

"My guess is that in a year or two, they'll be completely gone," 
says Jack Eugster, head of the Musicland Group, the largest 
American record chain with 685 stores. 

The cold hard facts are provided by the Recording Industry 
Association of America. According to the RlAA, LP sales 
dropped 67 percent between 1980-1987 and 33 percent in 1988. 

In contrast, compact discs (introduced by Sony and Philips in 
1983), jumped utronomically from 800,000 sold in the first year 
to 102.1 million in 1987. Last year CD sales rose another 31 
percent. Afrer only five and a half years on the marker, CDs now 
outsell LPs three to one. Though CDs are rapidly gaining, 
cassettes are currently the preferred format, accounting for 53 
Percent of all prerecorded music sales. 

So who is responsible for this crunch on vinyl1 Could it be the 
manufacturers, who have stopped pressing some older albums on 
vinyl and are releasing newer titles only on CD or cassette? 

Or maybe the retailers are to blame. For they are the ones who 
continue to peel the not-so-hot-wax from their shelves because 
sales are slow. And then, of course, there is always the consumer 
- who yearns for better sound, increased durability and conven-
ience the digital audio provides. 

Perhaps we all lent a hand in di(lKing vinyl's grave. I suppose 
only time will tell if it was worth it.

The project , to be built on the 

corner of Villa La Jolla and Gil-
man Drive, was approved on the 
condition that the developers must 
make "a good faith effort" to limit 
the number of adults to two per 
bedroom, City Planner Kevin 
Sullivan said. 

According to Sullivan, the 
condition was created in response 
to complaints filed by neighbors 
of the proposed site. 

The project , undertaken by 
Western National Properties, was 
officially submitted for approval 
a year ago and at that time was 
passed. The neighbors then ap-
pealed the decision to the City 
Council. 

Dancers and Musicians

According to Jim Lantry of 
Lantry Consultants - Western 
National Properties' consulting 
firm - the stipulation was added 
to prevent the renting of apart-
ments by UCSD students. 

"The neighbors felt students 
were disruptive, noisy, .. , and 
would use their parking lot," he 
said noting that the neighbors 
blame their lack of parking spaces 
on UCSD students. 

Lantry aid that in reality the 
problem is that the parking lot 
built for the neighbor'S condomi-
niums were built at a lower stand-
ard than is now required by San 
Diego codes and therefore cannot 
accommodate all the occupant's 
cars. 

He added, however, that "the 
developers don't intend to dis-
criminate against students in any 
way." 

Rather, he said that it was the 
neighbors who initialed the com-
plaints and prompted the stip-
ulation. 

"[The developers] felt those 
people who opposed the project 
were out of line." 

Shirley Zirkel, a condominium 
owner at La Jolla Terrace, was 
one of the many who appealed the 
planning director's decision. 

"We had some questions about 
parking. We felt that visitors ... 
would have to park on the street," 
said Zirkel, who expressed con-
cern that visitors would have to 
park on Gilman Drive, where she 
said many UCSD students already 
park. 

"But whose fault is it?" A.S. 
Vice President of External Affairs 
Mordecai Potash asked of the 
parking situation on Gilman. 
Drive. 

"Those aren't [all] UCSD cars

with their parents and they park 
there too," he said. 

"I'm going to find out what's 
going on," Potash continued.

ers] would be happy to go down

Golf Heading to Nationals Baseball Stomps Pomona-Pitzer 

By PHIL GRUEN 
Sports Editor 

Mi sing a week of school for 
a trip to Iowa may not seem to 
be a very logical move, espe-
ciall y among academically-
minded UCSD students. But 
for the week of May 22, you 
can bet that schoolwork will 
not be much of a concern for 
the Triton golf team. 

Yesterday's performance at 
the Point Lorna Nazarene invi-
tational, coupled with Mon-
day's performance in a match 
against Cal State San Bernar-
dino, Redlands, and La Verne 
at Torrey Pines, ensured the 
Tritons that plane tickets will 

be a nece sity when they travel 
to Panora, Iowa for the CAA 
Division III National Champ-
ionships. 

The four-<lay tournament , 
which runs from May 22-26, 
will feature approximately 21 
teams and a total of 120 indi-
vidual players, according to 
Triton Head Coach Mike 
Wydra. 

"Everybody's really pumped 
up," Wydra said of his players. 
"Now we're going to start some 
intensive practicing." 

Before the intensive practic-
ing stans, however, the Trit-
ons will have to compete in one 
more regular-season match -

Playoffs Begin Friday for 
Undefeated Men's Lacrosse 
By PHIL GRUEN 
Sports Editor 

UCSD's undefeated men's la-
crosse team begins the tough 
road to the top this weekend 
when it faces UCLA Friday night 
in the first round of the playoffs . 
The Tritons, with easy victories 
over Santa Clara and San Jose 
State last weekend, finished the 
season with a perfect I I -0 record. 

Should the Tritons defeat Div-

ision I UCLA in the 8:30 p.m. 
game on Friday night, they will 
earn the right to face Whittier 
College in a 2 p.m. game on 
Sunday. Whittier, a perennial 
powerhouse, has been given a 
bye in the first round of the 
tournament. 

There are twelve colleges over-
all that will be represented in the 
playoffs, divided up into North-
ern and Southern Divisions. In

They ay it ain't over 'till the fat 
lady sings. Well, Tuesday after-
noon the fat lady serenaded early 

in the bottom of the third 
inning - as UCSD exploded for 
seven run en route to a 9-3 
trouncing of Pomona-Pitzer at 
Olsen Field . 

The victory improved the Trit-
ons' record to 18-14 (11-5 in Div-
ision III) and with only six games 
left in the regular season, playoff 
hopes seem a little brighter. 

"Our chances of making the 
Regionals are very good," Triton 
Head Coach Lyle Yates said. "I 
still think we're one of the top 
contenders. and at this point I 
basically believe our destiny is 
resting in our own hands." 

After dropping their last two 
on the road (a 7-6 loss to South-
ern California College in the bot-
tom of the ninth and a 15-2 hum-
bling at the hands of Division I 
(USIU), UCSD rose to the occa-
sion at home behind an explo-
sive offense and a strong outing 
from pitcher Rick Rupkey. 

Rupkey went six innings, giv-
ing up only one run (unearned) on 
four hits while striking out two 
and walking none. At one point , 
he had retired 15 out of 16 and 
helped his own cause by making 
five putouts. 

Pomona jumped on top early 
as leadoff batter Steve Fenton

Steve Fenton and Pomona-Pitzer were not on the ball Tuesday. 

Matt Bynum. Fenton went to 
third on a hit-and-run single by 
Paul Thompson, and scored one 
out later on a double to left by 
Jeff Ishii . 

There was no more scoring 
until the bottom of the third when 
the Triton bats came alive. After 
leadoff hitter Erik Judson reached 
on an error and stole second, 
Anthony Sanchez followed with 
an RBI double to right and the 
game was deadlocked at one. 
Henry Jimenez then walked (one 
of 10 free trips the Tritons would 
receive on the day) and clean-up 
batter Dave Ligerman doubled to 
center, scoring Sanchez. A walk 
to Chris Murphy loaded the bases 
for the hot-hitting Gary Fessia. 
With a one-two count, Fessia 
rocked a grand slam over the left 
field fence to put the Tritons com-
fortably ahead, 6-2. 

The grand slam was Fessia's 

first in college and his third home 
run in four games. 

'1Staning pitcher Jeff Dean] 
hung a curve ball up and in. 
That's my favorite pitch,~ Fessia 
said. "When I saw it, my eyes just 
lit up." 

Fessia's seventh home run of 
the season (24th overall) was fol-
lowed by a towering shot over the 
left field fence by catcher Jim 
Martinez. In three years of bat-
ting behind Fessia, it marked the 
first time the two have hit back-
to-back home runs. 

The Tritons added another run 
in the founh as Ligerman drew a 
walk and went to third on Mur-
phy's double down the line in left. 
Fessia followed with another shot 
to left, but Jimmy Lin made a 
diving catch to rob him of extra 
bases. The ball was deep enough 
to score Ligerman and Fessia's

PHIL'S ANALYSIS ... I don't like having to pick 
against our own team, but this one leaves me little 
choice. On Saturday, UCSD is scheduled to play two 
games: one in the morning against the USA National 
Team and then another one at night versus the Hun-
garian National Team. What is this, the Olympics? No 
offense to the Tritons, but if these national teams play 
their top players, I'm not sure we stand a chance - let 
alone any college team. It's tough enough on the 
Tritons to play one of these national teams ... but 
two? Get real. Besides, the game against the Euro-
peans is at 7 p.m., and if they haven't eaten, they're 
gonna be hungary. Uh oh, stupid joke. Anyway, 111 
have to find out who's responsible for this kind of 
scheduling, but for now .. . .

fifth RBI of the game marked a 
personal high. 

The Sage Hens added one in 
the seventh off reliever Rich 
Tomolonis, and another in the 
eighth off Mike Morgan . UCSD 
came up with one of its own in the 
bottom of the eighth when Fessia 
walked and stole second and then 
came home on Dave Nowlan's 
single. Nowlan was two-for-two 
after replacing Martinez at first in 
the sixth inning. 

J . J. Fisher came on to retire 
the side in order in the ninth and 
preserve the victory for Rupkey 
(8-3). 

"I think we definitely showed 
we were Ihe better ballclub," 'Yates 
said. "However, I was a little dis-
appointed with (Jur lack of inten-
sity after jumping out with eight 
runs early. 

" It's tough for the team to stay 
up when we're obviously a better 
club. I'd like to see them play like 
we did against [Cal State] San 
Bernardino when we were up 
every inning and kept up Ihe 
intensity," he said. 

The Tritons have a tough test 
ahead when they face Division II 
Chapman College on Thursday 
and The Master's College, an 
NAIA school. in a Saturday 
afternoon doubleheader. UCSD 
split a doubleheader with The 
Master's earlier this year. 

SPORTS 
'These are big games," Yates 

said . "But as long as we can keep 
up the intensity. I think our team 
has the ability to beat anyone, 
anytime. "

addition to UCSD, UCLA, and 
Whittier , other Southern 
Division teams include: Arizona, 
Arizona State. and University of 
San Diego. The Nonhern Div-
ision includes UC Berkeley, UC 
Davis, UC Santa Barbara . 
Sonoma State. Chico State and 
Santa Clara. 

If UCSD manage to defeat 
both UCLA and Whittier, it will 

be placed within a four team 
bracket (two schools from each 
of the Divisions) who will com-
pete in the semifinals beginning 
April 28 in Arizona. 

The Tritons have faced only 
Arizona State and Sanla Clara 
among the teams competing in 
the playoffs, but have beaten 
both handily. 

Saturday'S solid 18-6 victory 
over Santa Clara was highligh-
ted offensively by both Brad 
Bunten (four goals, two assists) 
and Juan Millan (four goals , one 
assist). Joe Brown had a busy 
day in the goal , saving 20 shots.

,SUN LITE VOLLEYBALL CLASSIC ' 
Hudson-Klintworth win 
Volleyball title 

It was business as usual for 
Sean Hudson and Diana Klint-
worth at their South MIssion ottlce 
last Saturday They gave an all -
day seminar on how to play beach 
volleyball to a group of UCSD vol-
leyball afiCionados 

The event billed Itself as the 
Eighth SL1nlite Beach Volleyball 
ClaSSIC, but the sheer reality of It 
was Simple. ThiS was a Hudson-
Klintworth. Inc. cliniC. 

Hudson and Kltntworth. two of 
the more seasoned volleyball play-
ers around UCSD these days, 
pretty much had their way most of 

the day a5 e 
through the p n ry round With 
5-1 records In the otational mixed 
doubles format. 

When they paired up in the 
championship round. the results 
were Similar as they defeated the 
team of I.uke Lau and Stephanie 
Eischen In the semiS, and the 
team of Greg Husar and Jenny 
Kingsbury 15-3 In the finals. 

In the AA championships, Sean 
lim and Michelle Einspar defea-
ted Paul Milkier and Jeanne 0 'Â· 
Halloran 15-12

WHAT A JOKE 
ongratulation to this quarter's first Bud Team. WHAT 

A JOKE, of Men's AA softball, made just that of their first 
game of the season. Led by the outstanding pitching of 
Grabby Mendoza , AKA "The Arabian Prince", and the 
power mashing of Rich MSchwarznegger" Buenting, Joke 
went on to maul their opponent 19-2. Wow! 

Remember, there are only five Bud Teams left this year. 
so let the Bud Man know you're out there. 

Good luck with the rest of the season. THIS B 0

UCSD Hockey Squad goes/or "One/or the Thumb" 
ThiS Fridy and Saturday UCSD 

and the Intramural Dept. Will host 
the 8th Annual California Floor 
Hockey Tournament. The tour-
nament features the top floor 
hockey teams representing unl Â· 
verSIties from all over the state of 
California ThiS year the tourna Â· 
ment Will be the largest ever With 
twelve teams competing. We have 
SIX UC's alone compettng thiS 
year: DaVIS, San-ta Cruz. Santa 
Barbara. Riverside. Irvtne and 
UCSD. Also compettng for the 
title will be ~an Diego St.. USD, 
USC, San BernadinO State. Cal 
Poly SLO p and Loma Unda 
Unlversitv. 

UCSD has dominated the tourÂ· 
nament In the past, winning the 
last four. The battle cry for thiS 

I "N N E R TUB E 
WATER POLO 

Fast Start! 
What's all that screaming and 

yelling comtng from the natato-
rium every night till 1 a.m.? ,,Â·s one 
of the zaniest games ever cooked 
up by the Intramural gods. It 's that 
populal spring sport called Inner-
tube Waterpolo. 

ThiS sport IS always popular 
because everyone can play-ex-
penence not required. All you have 
to do is Jump In your tube and get 

year's squad will be "One for Ihe 
Thumb." That's the only tinger 
without a championship ring. 

ThiS year UCSD will be repreÂ· 
sented by our AAA championship 
team. Floor Wax. ThiS IS a first for 
thiS squad. The idSt couple of 
years UCSD has been represÂ· 
ented by either Blitzkrelg or Capt. 
Dick and HIS Seamen. They have 
done a worthy job of representing 
the big Â·UÂ·. Now It'S Floor Wax's 
turn. 

Floor wax IS led by Mr. Hockey 
himself, Rich Troop. They call 
Rich "The Great One" around 
here. King Rich has been around 
for years and done nothing but 
play great hockey-and occa-
Sionally change a light bulb. Also 
compettng IS the best goalie thiS 

out there. Now, some players are 
a little better In the tube than othÂ· 
ers. Some guys and gals can 
really go. They get up and down 
the pool like MagiC on the fast 
break. Less experienced players 
make lifeguards nevrvous as they 
can barely stay in the tube Just 
sitting upright for 30 seconds is an 
accomplishment. 

All players have a great time 
and the 1M department has a 
league to fit any talent level 
(recreational-A. intermedlate-AA, 
competittve-AAA). 

Every league is full , and the 
teams on the waiting list are anx-

If you can believe It, KeVin allowed 
the grand total of one goal this 
season AmaZing! Leadtng the 
defense is Marty McSorley clone 
Tom "I May Be Small But Don 't 
â¢â¢â¢â¢ With Me" MOrrison. The one 
and only Steve Kent IS also comÂ· 
ing back to play. Rumor even has 
it that UCSD has imported a super-
star from the frozen tundra of

starts tomorrow 
With a limited amount of entry 

spots still available, the annual 
UCSD Intramural Golf Champion-
ships begin to gear up for another 
one of its famous threeÂ· day runs. 

With the Torrey Pines Driving 
Range reporting record turnouts 
of UCSD goiters all week, it 
appears that a number of hacker 
hopefuls will be out to wrest the 
1M title from defending champ Doug 
Dannevik, The UCSD Women's 
Volleyball Coach.

sistent rounds last year en route 
to a one-stroke win over B.C. lit-
tle little has been hopping mad 
ever since and is confidently pre-
dlcling that he'll be ahead of 
Dannevlk thiS year. Whether that 
means he'll be ahead of anybody 
else, we don't know
