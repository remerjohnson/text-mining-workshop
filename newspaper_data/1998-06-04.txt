State University freshman 
Terel Tinsley died last 
Sunday night after contract-
ing bacterial meningitis. The 
Georgia freshman began 
showing symptoms on 
Saturday afternoon and was 
taken directly to the hospital 
from his room in OSU's 
Siebert Hall on Sunday. 
Tinsley died three hours later. 
Because of the severity and 
contagious nature of menin-
gitis, OSU Student Health 
Center Director Ted Grace 
advises students who may 
have come in contact with 
Tinsley to come to the center 
to receive preventati ve 
an ti biotics . Between 25 and 
30 students had requested 
medication by Monday, and 
Grace said he expects up to 
200 people to ult imately seck

CAMBRIDG E, Mass. -
Harvard Lec turer Tamara

ACADEMIA: Harvard agricultural, 
development economist C. Peter 
Timmer will take office August 1 
By Paul Dodge 
Senior Staff Writer 

The man considered by many to be the most 
prominent economist studying Indonesia today, C. 
Peter Timmer has been selected as the new dean of 
UCSD's Graduate School of International Relations 
and Pacific Studies (IRlPS). 

Timmer is currently a Thomas D. Cabot 
Professor of Deve lopment Studies at Harvard 
Uni versity. According to Chancellor Robert Dynes, 
his extensive experience will add to UCSD's already 
stellar reputation. ' 

"Timmer's background and interest in the Pacific 
region position him perfectly to lead IRIPS into the 
21 5t cenlury," Dynes said. 

Timmer has advised the governments of 

Indonesia, Vietnam, China and the Philippine on 
issues such as agricultural policy and economic 
development. He was awarded the Billtang Jasa 
Utama (Highest Merit Star) by the president of 
Indonesia in 1992, and he received the American 
Agricultural EconQmics Association 's award for 
professional excellence in 1994. He has also pub-
lished numerous articles and an internationally 
acclaimed book. 

Timmer said he is pleased to become a member 
of the UCSD community. 

"This is an incredible time to be joining (RIPS," 
he said. "IRlPS is uniquely situated and endowed 
with faculty to ... offer its students an innovative and 
effective, but most importantly, a deeply informed, 
professional training. I am simply delighted to be 
joining this faculty and university." 

In addition to his international experience, 
Timmer has taught in four separale facullies of 
Harvard University since 1977 - the economics

Faculty to 
Vote on 
Division II 
ATHLETICS: Twenty-
five professors signed 
mail-ballot petition 
By Jennifer Grady 
Guardian Reporter 

UCSD appears to be well on its 
way to NCAA Di vision II status, but 
it may encounter opposition when the 
1,350 members of the campus 
Academic Senate vote via mail ballot 
nex t fa ll. 

The Academic Senate offi ce 
received the petition on May II . The 
names of the 25 petitioners have not 
been disclosed. 

According to Academic Senate 
Manager Judy Morales, Academic 
Senate bylaws allow for the circula-
tion of a petition as long as the peti-
tion represents the views of at least 25 
faculty members. 

"The bylaws provide that any 
action of the Representative 
Assembly shall be submitted to a mail 
ballot when, at the request of 25 
members of the San Diego Division 
of the Academic Senate, the petition 
is submitted to the chair of the 
Academic Senate after 10 days of cir-
culation of the minutes," she said. 

Last year, 87 percent of the stu-
dents voting in the A.S. elections 
favored the proposed move to 
Division II athletics. 

This year, after a three-hour meet-
ing on April 28, the Academic Senate 
Representative Assembly voted 31 to 
12 in favor of a move from NCAA 
Division 111 athletics to Division II. 

Ultimately, Chancellor Robert 
Dynes will have the final decision on 
this issue, but before he can decide, a 
mail ballot mUSI take place among the 
faculty. The mail-ballot proceedings

Number of Student Misconduct Cases 
Jumps 886 Percent From Fall '96 to '97 
DISCIPLINE: Rise i 
partially due to new 
data-collection methods 
By Vincent Gragnani 
Staff Writer 

Accord ing to recently releu. ed 
fa ll 1997 stati stics, there has been 
an 886 percenl increase in studenl 
misconduct incidents since fall 
1996. However, admini strators 
attribute part o f the large ri sc 10 
revi sed reponing methods. 

The report , which was prepared 
by the Office of Student Policies 
and Judicial Affair , states that 496 
complai nts were Ii led in fall 1997. 
Just 56 were tiled in fall 1996. 

Past statistics huve only includ-
ed information reported by the w l-
lege deans. This year, information 
was also collec ted from the resi -
dent deans. 

Muir Dean Chips Drcilinger 
said that for thi s yeur's statistics, 
single cases were counted as many 
a three separate times. 

"The deans will be working on 
eliminating w nflicts for more 
accurate stuti stics," he said. 

However, Drei linger noted that 
the increase is not due solely to dif-

ferent reporting methods. 
ot including cases processed 

by the residenl dean ·, Ihe repon 
states Ih'lI 156 complaints were 
handled by thc college deans in full 
1997 - a 279-percent increase 
from fall 1996. 

A lthough .it was nOI included in 
the report, Dreilinger said there 

In fa ll 1996, 12 students were 
charged with th ' unlawful posses-

~ i on or use of a controlled su b-
stance. Conver -ely, 22 sludents 
were charged with such vio lat ions 
in fall 1997. 

Alcohol vio lations increased 
from 41 inciJcnts in fall 1996 to 
204 incidents in fall 1997. The

UCSD Students Travel to Riverside for 
Annual Student of Color Conference 
TRIP: Proposition 209, 
racial issues discussed at 
gathering last weekend 
By Christine Velarde 
Staff Writer 

Several UCSD students j oined 
students from other UC campuses 
at the annual Student Of Color 
Conference last weekend at UC 
Rivers ide. T he goal of the confer-
ence was to discuss current issues 
facing students from underrepre-
sented racial minority groups, par-
ticularly the concern s of universi ty 
students. 

Fifteen UCSD students allcnded 
. the weekend conference. 

Allendants allended workshops 
such as "Students and the labor 
Movement," "Education versus 
Incarceration," "Hate Crimes on 
Campus" and " Strategy 
Development for Students of 
Color." 

. A .S. Vice President External 
Kirk Matsuzaki. who attended the 
conference, said he spent most of 
his time discussing campus 
issues. 

" We dealt mostly with student 
issues," Matsuzaki said. 
"Especially with the post-209 era. 

We al so tulked about grassroots "It was nice 10 have a safe

"There are classes where there 
will be only one African American, 
and that would be kind of uncom-
fortable," Matsuzaki said. "If I was 
the only Asian in the room, I'd 
probably be a little uncomfortable 
too." 

There were also several caucus-
es at the conference where students 
could share their experiences. 

"The most pressing issue is 
affirmative action," Matsuzaki 
said. "A lot of students are sti II 
upset about 209. The numbers of 
minority students have dropped 
significantly at all the [UC] cam-
puses except Riverside, and every-
one is affected."

COMMENTARY: Having grown from a naive and idealistic novice to a jaded journalist, our writer remains 
optimistic that progress is possible - as long as we realize that our shortcomings can be used as tools for change 

JOURNALIST SEEKS TO FIND THE · 'TRUTH' IN TRUTH 
GRACE 
JAN G 

Against The 
Grain 

When ) took Illy first journalism 
course as a hig h school sophomore, 
I was young. ideali stic and nai ve . 
As ] wrote and rewrote lead after 
lead under the di scriminating eye 
of Mr. Hammer - my journalism 
teacher and, hence. the man indi-
rec tl y responsible for what I have 
written in the Guardian for the past 
three years - I tru ly believed jour-
nali sm to be the most effecti ve 
medium for change. 

I painstakingly labored over each 
sentence - double- and triple-
checking that all the facts were 
properly placed into the inverted 
pyramid; that all the quotes were 
ri ghtfully allrihuted and, most 
imponantly, that the anicle did not 
betray any sort of bias or imbalance. 

I took such pride in my work; as 
a IS yea r old with no driver's license 
and nothing but the mall to keep 
myse lf entertained, I often devoted 
entire days to the school newspaper. 
I often asked myself. "Am I doing 
my job? Am I doing it right?" 

J ga ined a childishl y bloated 
sense of importance. Knowing, fo r 
example, that because of an article 
I wrote, the entire high school was 
on the lookout for the thief who 
stoic thousands of dollars worth of 

equi pment from the auditorium, 
made me fee l so integral to the 
proce 's of attain ing truth. I soon 
grew addicted to the adrenaline 
rush of deadl ines and the satisfac-
tion of see ing my by line on thou-
sands of copies uf The Lowell. 

I the n dec ided that I wou ld be a 
journalis t. I was told that I would 
forever li ve a hand-to- mouth exis-
tence unles I became "the nex t 
Conn ie Chung." Undaunted, I con-
tinued tu fant asize about deadlines. 
by lines and interviews (I never 
really considered myse lf a TV-type 
personality, anyw<ly). 

I carried in my daily planner a 
copy of the "Code of the Society of 
Professional Journalists," frayed and 
wrinkled from constant handling. 
When I was fi rstlearningjoumalism, 
I took out the copy and reli giously 
read it once a day - to remind 
myself that my job was to serve the 
cOlllmon good. I found the fo llowing 
lines especially moti vating: 

"The purpo e of distribut ing 
news and enlightened opin ion is to 
serve the genera l we lfare .. .. Freedom 
of the press is to be guarded as an 
inalienable right of people in a free 
society. ft carries with it the freedom 
and the responsibi lit y to discuss, 
question and chall enge actions and 
ullerances of our government and 
our public and pri vate institutions. 
Journalists uphold the right to speak 
unpopular opinions and the pri vilege 
to agree with the rnajori ty." 

The code to pursuing Truth 

"'" 

I have learned over 
the years, however, 
that "truth" does 
not exist In capRa I 
letters - and It 
never should. 
became the mOllo of my life - and 
thcn I got jaded. 

Med ia coverage of the 1992 
L.A . uprisi ng wa a blatant traves-
ty of "seeking truth and reporting 
it. " All the major networks and 
daily newspapers depicted the riots 
in slIch a Oat, bi -dimensional man-
ner, that viewers and readers qui ck-
ly came to understand the situation 
as the resul t of racial tensions, with 
a clear bifurcation between the 
"good guys" and the "bad guys ." 

The "good guys" were white -
and the "bad guys"" Well , they 
were the uneducated barbari ans 
who tore through shop windows. 
slUfling their bags and pockets with 

stolen merchandi sc; they werc the 
ones who grinned foolishly at the 
cameras, exclaiming that the gala 

wu~ a "free-for-all ;" they we re the 
angry arsonists who indi scriminate-
ly destroyed everything in their 
path - and they were people of 
(,;0101". 

Coincidence? I think nol. No, 
the C:l lllc m tells no lies; peo ple, 
however, cont rol the cameras, edit 
the footage and manipul ate the 
meanings of images. 

Reporters and editors chucked 
Truth for tunnel vision. True, every-
thing viewers and readers saw rea l-
ly did take place - but the context 
in which the events t oo~ place were 
so distorted and misappropriated, 
that our "objecti ve" authoriti es of 
"news" may as well have been 
telling a talc of narrati ve fi ction. 

Yes, Korean merchants stood 
atop the roofs of their businesses 
with rifles, militantly guarding what 
was theirs. Yes, Korean liquor store 
owner Soon Ja Du shot blac k. 
Latasha Harlans - allegedly over a 
bottle of orange juice. In amplifying 
these isolated incidents, the collec-
ti ve mcdia demoni zed Koreans to be 
self-minded. money-hoarding capi-
tali sts. TIle uninformed public pas-
sively. unquestioningly took it all in , 
shaking its head at the immigrants' 
Ilagrantly opportunistic behavior. 

And the mcdia mogul s all 
breathed a sigh of relief. In scape-
goating Korean merchants for the 
unruliness exhibited by blacks and 

Latinos, whites had sucl:essfull y 
displaced the burden of blame off 
their shoulders and onto the Kore-
an/Korean American community. 

Employing devices such as the 
ca mera. stereotypes and. most 
importantly, white privilege, the 
media pilled the races against each 
other - all the while under the 
gui se of the paternalisti c mediator 
frow ning upon the rivalry between 
the communities of co lor and 
patron iz ingly imploring, "Can' t 
you all j ust get along?" 

So, how did the white media dis-
place the blame off thei r shoulders 
and onto those of Koreans? Well , 
first of all , they amplified isolated 
incid<;;nts of Koreans shooting blu\:ks 
to a degree in which Kore<lns have 
now been stereotyped to be cold, cal-
culating capitalists - the paragon of 
the model minority (a myth that pits 
Asians and Asian Americans against 
other people of color). 

Nex t, in telling the stories of 
these isolated incidents, the white 
media irresponsibly (yet conve-
niently) omitted the fact that huh-
drcds of Korean store owners are 
shot <lnd killed each year - with-
out even so much as an obituary in 
the paper. 

Furthermore, the media failed to 
ex plain the historical context to the 
situation; that, even before learning 
English, immigrants are thoroughly 
versed on the racial hierarchy that 
comprises the very fabri \: of Amer-

6 OPINION The UCSO Guardian Thursday, June 4, 1998 

COMMENTARY: Straying from the beaten path and trying to figure out what makes himself tick, Guardian Editor 
Terry Lew has searched the margins of life and found the often-scary horizon to make all the difference. 

TALES OF ADVENTURE ON THE ROAD LESS TRAVELED 
By Terry Lew 
Editor in Chief 

Sometimes I wonder if Robert 
Frost was on to something - while 
passi ng through a yellow wood, he 
I.:ame across a fork in the road. One 
path led off into the undergrowth 
and the unknown, while the other 
Icd grassi ly toward home. 

Frost I.:hose the latter, thinking 
that he might someday return, but 
knowing in his heart of hearts that 
the moment had passed and that it 
would never come again . 

The unknown scares us. We 
don 't know where the road less 
traveled goes, if it goes anywhere 
at all, and it 's all too often that 
we're too afraid (0 find ou\. We' re 
I.:o ntent to live our lives on the 
beaten track, never leaving it to see 
what lies just beyond our horiz.ons. 
We may be alive, but we aren' t 
really living. 

Real life happens on the mar-
gins, where things aren't always as 
neat and tidy as we'd like them to 
be. Real life is messy, and nothing 

is ever as easy as it seems. 
Every day we make choices that 

affect the rest of our li ves. Some 
are consc ious decisions, like 
switching our major for the 
umpteenth time, and some are 
unconscious - the little things that 
don ' t seem so important at the 
time, but the ones that make all the 
differenl.:e in the world. 

Most of the time, the choices 
fall somewhere in between -
something we 've thought about 
doing, perhaps, hut th at we 
haven' t worked up the nerve to 
actually do . A lot of the time, 
we ' re too scared to break out of 
the boxes that our fami lies have 
placed us in. My father always had 
this dream of me becoming an 
allorney and taking over hi s prac-
tice, while my mother always to ld 
me that whatever I wanted to do 
with my life was fine. 

Somewhere along the line, they 
realized that I was my own person 
and that I had to li ve my own li fe. 
As much as they would have liked 

to stand by and keep me from 
sc rewing everything up, I had to 
make my own mistakes in order to 
learn from them. 

Like a child taking his or her 
first steps, we each need to ligurc 
out for ourselves what does and 
does not work. We need to di scov-
er our own paths, something that no 
one else can do for us. 

We can choose the easy route, 
doing what's expected of us and toe-
ing the line, or we can break free and 
go our own way. Not everyone is cut 
from the same doth , and different 
things make different people tick . 

I'm still trying to figure out 
what makes me tick . This is the last 
i sue of the Gua rdian for which 
I'm even nominally in charge (next 
year's staff has put these last two 
issues together, so be sure to con-
gratulate them on a job well done), 
and I'm ready to get out of here. 

I've poured my heart and soul 
into the newspaper for the last four 
years, and - quite frankly - I'm 
tired of it. I've had the time of my 
life at the Guardian, but I'm ready 
to move on. I came to UCSD think-
ing that journalism was what I want-
ed to do wi th my life, and now it 's 
one of the furthest things from my 
mind. 

I' ve written volumes about my 
change of heart before, so J'II skip 
the details, but suffi ce it to say that 
I' m happier now than I've ever 
been. The paper was a major part of 
my li fe, but it was a stormy mar-
ri age, at bes\. I've been stabbed in 
the back and cut off at the knees 
more times than I can remember 
(a lthough I'm no sai nt myself), and

CHANCELLOR UNVEILS 10-POINT ACTION PLAN ON DIVERSITY 

Chancel/or's 
Corner 

Chancellor Dynes created a 
Commission on Diversity in 1997 
to engage in wide-ranging discus-
sions focused on improving 
UCSO's diversity efforts. The com-
mission reported its recommenda-
tions to the chancellor in February 
of 1998. Subsequently, the chancel-
lor broadly sought campus com-
ment on the report. The chancellor 
and vice chancellors also intensely 
considered the report's recommen-
dations and their implementation 
and developed additional strategies 
to im;rease and nurture di versity. 
Based upon this comprehensive 
approach, Oynes has created, and is 
immediately implementing, the fol -
lowing 10-Point Diversi ty Action 
Plan. 

I. To underscore hi s and the 
campus' commitment to diversity, 
and to ensure that diversity efforts 
are pursued as a major institutional 
priority, the chancellor wholeheart-
edly accepts the commission's rec-
ommendation 10 designate himself 
as the chief diversity officer of 
UCSD. .. 

2. To strengthen the impact and 
cohesiveness of UCSD's diversity 
efforts, the chancellor is estahlishing 
a UCSD Diversity Council, com-
prised of faculty, stall and students. 
This will not be an administration 
council; the members will represent 
the full UCSD community. 

The council will replace the 
chancellor 's Affirmative Action 
Advisory Comrni ll ee and the 
Diversity Education Leadership 
Team. Building on the achieve-
ments of tho~c committees, the 
council wi II oversee a broad agen-
da of proactive diversity activities. 
These include further as,essing the 
effectiveness of U SO's diversity 
efforts and programs, bringing 
diversity issues and opportunities 
to the chancellor's attention and 
recommending policy changes that 
will positively impact diversity at 
UCSD. 

3. To increase student diver ity, 
the campus is setti ng a goal of 
tripling UCSO's current scholar-
sh ip base to annually awarding $1 
million in undergraduate scholar-
ships by the year 2002. In addition, 
the dean of graduate studies and the 
vice chancellor of developmenl and 
uni versity relations will seek 
increased private funding for grad-
uate fellowships. 

4. To increase the diversity of 
the undergraduate student body, the 
campus has established a goal of 
annually increasi ng UCSO's new, 
underrepresented student popula-
tion by 10 percent. The vice chan-
cellor for student affairs and his 
staff have pledged their commit-
ment to achieving this goa\. Further, 
the vice chancellor of development 
and university relations pledges to 
assist academic departments and 
programs in ohtaining ex ternal sup-
port for joint student/faculty out-
reach efforts to attract new students 
and for academic enrichment pro-
grams for current students. 

To underscore his 
and the campus' 
commitment to 
diversity, and to 
ensure that 
diversity efforts are 
pursued as a major 
Institutional priority, 
the chancellor 
wholeheartedly 
accepts the 
commission's 
recommendation to 
designate himself 
as the chief 
diversity officer of 
UCSD. 

5. As a further step toward 
increasing undergraduate diversity, 
high achievers from all high 
schools in San Diego ami Imperial 
counties ~hou ld be identifi ed and 
recruited to UCSD. Toward this 
goal, the chancell or and the vice 
chancellor of student affairs are 
committed to working with the 
Admissions Committee on a plan 
to offer admission to the top 4 per-
cent of UC-eli gible graduates from 
each high school in these two coun-
ties. 

In addition, the chancellor lind 
vice chancellor of student affairs 
initiated this year the Com munity 
Scholarship Program in which the 
campus partners with high school 

principal to award scholarships to 
UCSO-e li gible student s who 
demon trate a commitment to their 
community. 

6. Setting im;reased faculty 
diversity a an institutional priority, 
the chancellor pledges resources to 
effons that produce results . Toward 
this goal, the senior vice chance llor 
of academic affairs will benchmark 
and recom mend to the chancellor 
the nation's "best practices" in fac -
ulty recruitment and retention. Also 
toward thi s end, a Distinguished 
Visit rs Program and the "Profi les 
in Diversity" project recommended 
by the commission will be imple-
mented. 

7. To address staff diversity 
issues, the vice chancellor of busi-
ne s affairs will institute this ycar 
performance requirements for 
administrators' , managers' and 
other employees' adherence to the 
UCS D Principles of Community 
and support for diversity. 

Campus-wide funding for train-
ing and professional develupment 
will be increased, and greater staff 
access to training will be promoted. 
Further, a number of staff recruit-
ment and retention efforts, and 
other initiatives aimed at increasing 
staff diversity, will be pursued on 
an ambitious timetable. 

8. Initiatives that improve the 
campus climate will be nurtured. 
The Cross Cultural Center and the 
Women's Center are examples of 
programs that have accomplished 
this goal. As the commission rec-
ommends. resources for these cen-
ters will be increased. Space for 
UCSO's lesbian, gay, bisexual and 

• .... s..y 
. DIOO 

transgender communitic wi II be 
one of the first issues the Diversity 
Council considers. 

9. To ensure that they recei ve 
the broadest input possible , the 
Diver ilY Council will talk with 
campus constituencies regarding 
the development and implementa-
tion of diver ity initiatives. On the 
chancellor's behalf and through a 
variety of methods - including a 
twi ce-yearly Diversity Forum -
the counci l will facilitate an 
exchange or views on diversi ty 
issues, challenges and strategies, 
The council will bring these mat-
ters to the chancel!or for review 
and action. 

10. The chancellor will imple-
ment the C.R.E.A.T.E. program, a 
UCSD -designed, comprehensive 
initiative to increase the number of 
underrepresented students who 
achieve UC-eligibility, enroll at 
UCSD and other UC-caliber uni-
versities, and fulfill their potential 
as co llege students and graduates. 
This broad K-12 outreach effort 
includes the creation of a model 
school, partnerships with school 
clusters, teacher development , out-
reach and recruitment , research, 
and an assessment of K- 12 educa-
tional practices. 

Each vice chancellor also has 
created detailed responses to spe-
cific recommendations in the 
Oiversity Commission's report. 
That comprehensive response is 
titled the Chancellor 's Diversity 
Plan and will be available at:

able to invite myself to lunch with 
the President of the United States. I 
couldn' t have stood on the roof of the 
library, waving at the people passing 
below. I wouldn 't have my current 
job, nor my future career with the 
county health department. 

I would have been just another 
face, going to classes, taking finals, 
paying my tuition and walking 
away four years later with a diplo-
ma and a pat on the back. Instead. I 
feel like I helped to make a differ-
ence. I feel like I was part of some-
thing special. 

Sure, there were times when I 
wanted to walk away and never 
come back, and there were times 
when it seemed like the entire staff 
wanted nothing more than to see 
me strung up by my entrails - but 
despite it all, I wouldn't think twice 
about doing it again. I'd do it in a 
heartbeat. 

I took the road less traveled, and 
it made all the difference.

10 OPINION 

GRAIN: 
Journalism effective 
medium for change 
ContInued fr ......... I 
ica's founding principles - white 
on top, everyone else on the bot-
tom. The white construction of 
Asian Americans as the "model 
minority" led many, including 
Asians themselves, to believe that 
Asian Americans could possibly 
occupy a position as the second 
layer in the tri -Iayered racial hierar-. 
chy - if not the topmost layer. 

Moreover, the media failed to 
mention the coalition-building in 
which many Koreans have actively 
worked to reconstruct black and 
Latino communities following the 
riots. 

In arguing that Koreans have 
been unfairly scapegoated, I am by 
no means condoning the murder of 
Harlans, nor attempting to trivialize 
the pain innicted upon her family 
and community. My point is that the 
white media had a vested interest in 
portraying "news" events in a cer-
tain manner - as truth - with thi s 
fact highlighted and that fact loen-
tioned merely in passing, if at all. 

Importantly, I am not pointing 
fingers at any particular white indi-
vidual, nor at the white race as a 
collective, for that matter. When I 
say "white" I am speaking first and 
foremost of an ideology. 

Malcolm X best explained it 
when he described his encounters 
at Mecca, where he first experi -
enced the true meaning of brother-
hood across the races: 

"That morning was when I first 
began to reappraise the 'white 
man.' 11 was when I first began to 

The 

perceive that ' white man,' as com-
monly used, means complellion 
only secondarily; primarily it 
described attitudes and actions." 

Simply being white in race does 
not necessarily qualify any single 
indi vidual to bear the gui It of thou-
sands of years of white coloniza-
tion and oppression . Moreover, 
simply being a person of color does 
not necessarily indicate that any 
single individual is incapable of 
exploitation and oppression. You 
can be white and "down for the 
cause," just as you can be a person 
of color and one of the most detri -
mental forces in the struggle for 
soc ial progress. (I hope r have 
made that clear in all of my arti-
cles.) 

So, how docs all of thi s tie into 
my sophomoric endeavors in pur-
suing journalism, and what is my 
point'! 

I was quixotic, with loft y ellpec-
tations of the "objectivity" that I 
assumed to be inherent in journal-
ists. I now know that objec tivity is 
an unanainable ideal, for journal-
ists are human. Those humans who 
claim they are "unbiased and 
objective" are bullshitting; they 
suffer from a God-complex. Only a 
superhuman, divine entity can 
stand away and apart from society, 
in the heavens, and rightfully claim 
10 be objective and free from all 
bias (even this is questionable). 

I am jaded, but I am, at the same 
time, optimistic. I still do believe 
that journalism is the most effec-
tive medium for change - only if 
journalists reali ze that they are fal -
lible and human. In an ironic way, 
the moment that we rea li ze our 
shortcomings is the moment in 
which we are closest to perfection.

The UCSD Guardian 

For when we are made aware that 
we are not infallible, we are most 
susceptible and inviting of change 
and, hence, that much closer to 
progress. 

I hope that next year's Guardian 
staff will embrace all that I have said 
and truly take to heart the belief that 
journali sm, when wielded properly, 
can really change li ves for the belter. 
Most importantly, however, I want 
to remind readers that "the purpose 
of distributing news and enlightened 
opinion is to serve the general wel-
fare" ; that freedom of the press is 
the "right of the people in a free 
society"; that freedom of the press 
carries with it the "responsibility to 
discuss." Discussion invo l v~s dia-
logue, which means active partici-
pation on the part of the readers and 
community members whom any 
newspaper serves. 

I am truly gratefu l to the input I 
have received - from those of you 
who have supported me in propa-
gating often unpopular ideas and to 
those of you who have challenged 
me to rea li ze my shortcomings. 
You have all been crucial to my 
growth and development and , so, I 
thank you. Hence, you have also 
been integral to the pursuit of truth . 

It was the quest for Truth that 
(irst led me into journali sm. I have 
learned over the years, however, that 
"truth" does not ellist in capital let-
ters - and it never should. Truth is 
as static as change. Truth also often 
has a way of comfoning the affiicted 
and affiicting the comfortable. Jour-
nalists should strive to be the pur-
veyors and challengers of such a 
truth. It is our duty to go against the 
grain of mainstream society - it is 
also our right and privilege. I hope 1 
have served you well.

sentence workers to do 
community service 
By Leena Shankar 
Associate News Editor 

Many students might wonder 
why UCSD forces its groundskeep-
ers to wear orange safety vests and 
work under the watchful eye of a 
probation supervisor. 

Though they have been in trou-
ble wi th the law, the workers on 
probation - who are not UCSD 
employees - are actuall y consid-
ered to be an asset to the university. 
For four days each week, between 
30 and 40 t:O mmunity service 
workers come to campus by bus to 
satisfy their court-ordered commu-
nity servi ce requirements. 

Physica l Plant Services 
Superintendent Steve Pyle sa id 
UCSD benefits greatly from having 
people serve out their sentences on 
campus. 

"Six or even years ago, at the 
time we started participating, we 
were going through budget cuts," 

VOTE: 
Dynes will make 
ultimate decision 
ContInued from page 1 
will take about three weeks , or 10 
days of uni versity instruction. 

A.S . President Joe Leventhal 
sa id that he believes the petition is 
an attempt for a minority of faculty 
members to be heard. 

" In my opinion, the intention of 
the petition is to make every last 
allempt for the minority of the fac-
ulty to shape the decision of this 
regarding the move to Division II," 
he said. 

Leventhal said he believes that 
it is not for the faculty to dec ide, 
but rather for the students to have 
input in the quality of life at their 
universi ty. 

"To me, this is fundamentally a 
student issue ... when general funds 
are not being used and scholarships 
are not being offered, it 's not a fa c-
ulty issue," Leventhal said. "But, 
regard less, they decided to consid-
er it [the petitionl . 

"Fortunately. after three hours 
of discussion, the Representativc 
Assembly voted in favor of movi ng 
to Division II ," he continued. "So 
it's open to any 25 fat:ulty to sign 
the petition and take it to a mail 
ballot as their last allempt to ki ll 
whatever proposa l is on the noor." 

Dynes sa id that he is strongly in 
favor of moving to Division II at 
the Apri l 28 meeting. 

Leventhal said he is hopeful 
that , when maki ng hi s decision, 
Dynes wi II consider that many 
Academic Senate committees, the 
Representative A 'embly, and 
many students support the move. 

"Hopefully this Imail ballot! 
will ha ve no impact, regardless of 
whether it is positive or negative 
for the move to Division II ," 
Leventhal said. 

The only way the move to 
Division II cou ld be interrupted is 
if the faculty vote against the move, 
and the chancellor decides to sup-
port that decision. In thal ca e, the 
move to Division II would not take 
place by the targeted goal of fall 
2000. 

Not all faculty members were

he said. "They help us keep the 
campus looking great and it saves 
us a lot of money ; we just have to 
pay for the supervisor's hours." 

The workers perform manual 
tasks, such as picking up fallen 
branches. According to Physical 
Plant Services Assistan t Supervisor 
Rohert Jones, UCSD especia ll y 
benefits from the workers' efforts 
before spec ial events. 

"Ri ght now, they are mulching a 
ridge wall near RIMAC Fie ld and 
dressi ng it up for the commence-
ment," Jones sa id. 

Moreover, during the winter's 
EI Nino rains, the workers were on 
hand to help during emergencies. 

"They were very helpful wi th 
emergency situati ons," Jones said. 
"They helped us to do sandbags 
and clean up." 

In fact, UCSD has recently 
faced competition for the workers' 
time. 

"So many people are finding out 
about th is ... it's hard for us to get 
workers," Pyle said. 

However, Probation 
Department spokesman Patri ck 

Stalnaker pointed out that onl y cer-
tain businesses and groups are eli -
gible to reap the benefi ts of proba-
tion workers. 

"By law, all of the projects can' t 
be done for profit-making ag.:n-
cies," Stalnaker said. " It has to be 
done for publicly funded agencies. 
Tbat way, the taxpayers save 
money." 

Although they ha ve com mined 
crimes, Stalnaker said the workers 
who arc sent into the communit y 
are not hardened criminals. 

"A lot of cri mes are like drunk 
driving or shoplifting; some of it is 
not even probation but time doing 
community serv ice for just minor 
offenses," he said. "Also, for 
instance, the fine for driving ille-
gally in the diamond lane is $275. 
If someone can' t afford it , then 
they can work it off." 

Pyle concurred that there is no 
need for worries about security; 
supervisors accompany the work-
ers for almost purely technical rea-
sons. 

"They have a supervisor who

DYNES: 
Speech outlined 10 
point diversity plan 
Continued from ..-i. 1 
scholar hip base to $1 mi Ili on in 
undergraduate scholarships annual-
ly. Also, he said he plans to seek 
increased funding from the private 

vice chancellor of academic affai rs, 
to recommend the nation's most 
successful practices in faculty 
recruitment and retention. Dynes 
also plans to establish a distin-
guished vi sitors program and the 
"Profiles in Diversity" project rec -
ommended by the Di versity 
Commission. 

" I believe that we can increase 
sector for graduale 
scholarships. 

Dynes said the 
fourth point of his 
plan is the goal of 
increasing UCSD's 
new underrepre-
sented student pop-
ulation by 10 pcr-
cent annually. 

The fifth point 
of Dynes' plan is to 
offer admission to 
the top 4 percent of 
each San Diego and 
Imperial County 
high school's UC-
eligible graduates. 

Dynes said that 

"Every year our 
campus devotes

human and 
financial 
resources to

- Robert Dynes 
Chancellor 

faculty diversity 
while simultane-
ously strengthen-
ing UCSO's acade-
mic climate ," 
Dynes said. 

The seventh 
point of Dynes ' 
plan addresses the 
issue of staff di ver-
sity. Steven Relyea, 
vice chancellor of 
business atTairs, has 
already instituted a 
set of performance-
evaluation criteria 
to evaluate efforts 
toward greater 
diversity. In addi-
tion, future recruit-
ment, retention and 
trai ni ng efforts wi II 
be aimed at increas-
ing staff diversity. 

Dynes said his 
eighth point 
involves an 
Increase in 
resources for the 

dents from San Diego and Imperial 
Counties who have demonstrated 
above-average commitment 10 their 
communities. 

For his sixth point Dynes said 
he asked Marsha Chandler, senior 

Cross Cultural Center and the 
Women's Center. One of the first 
issues the diversity council will 
consider is the Diversity 
Commission's recommendation to 
create UCSD's Lesbian, Gay, 

The UCSD Guardian 

Bisexual and Transgender Center. 
"Every year our campus devotes 

enormous human and financial 
resources to fostering it climate that 
nurtures scholars and scientists," 
Dyne said . "We need to give 
increased allention to creating a cli-
mate that nurtures diversity. 
Initiati ves that improve thc campus 
climate will be nurtured." 

The ninth point of Dynes' plan 
calls for a biannual diversity forum 
to be arranged by the di versity 
council in order to facilitate the 
exchange of ideas on pertinent 
issues. 

Finally, Dynes also pledged to 
implement the Center for Research 
on Educational Equity, Assessment 
and Teaching Excellence 
(C.R.E.A.T.E.), a comprehensive 
effort to increase the number of 
underrepresented students who are 
eligible for top-notch' universities 
like UCSO. 

After the announcement, Dynes 
invited the audience to ask ques-
tions. Various representati ves of the 
Student Affirmative Action 
Committee came forward to dispute 
Dynes' claim that he will maintain 
programs that foster diversity and 
change those programs that do not 
promote diversity. 

Former A.S. Vice President 
External Ana Mansury expressed 
her dissatisfaction with the difficul-
ty that SAAC organizations experi -
ence in trying to obtain A.S. fund-
ing for their recruitment efforts. 
She said that because of the chal-
lenges they face in order to get 
financial support from the council. 
their outreach programs are nega-
tively affected. 

Watson said that the priority is 
not to maintain tradition but to 
explore new venues to increase the 
number of underrepresented minor-
ity students at UCSD.

Several faculty and staff mem-

address to express their dissatisfac-
tion with the presence of eight 
police officers at the meeting, say-
ing it was not conducive to an 
atmosphere where free discussion 
was encouraged. 

"I second the students' call for 
action beyond the words ... as far as 
I know, no one has advocated vio-
lent action. I, as a faculty member

UCSD Police Sergeant Jeff 
Hutchison said the officers were 
present to prevent any protesters 
from gelling out of hand and dam-
aging university property. 

"We're here to protect life and 
property," he said. "We're just 
doing our job." 

However, Dynes said that he did 
not request protection. 

"I certainly didn't order them

Jury Rules in Favor of E,!-UCSD Researcher 
In Suit Against Agouron, Awards $200,000 

IR/PS: 
Timmer will be 
school's third dean 

THEn: Pharmaceutical 
company pair stole 
research from scientist 
By Annam Manthlram 
Staff Writer 

A San Diego Superior Court 
jury found scientists working at 
Agouron Pharmaceuticals Inc. of 
La Jolla guilty of stealing research 
from former UCSO researcher 
Huguette Pelletier last Thursday. 

Michele McTigue and her hus-
band Jay Davies U were found 
guilty for stealing misappropriated 
research from a federally funded 
lab at UCSD. With this research, 
scientists at Agouron attempted to 
produce a ON A-reparing drug, 
though this effort failed . 

Pelletier, now at Baylor College 
of Medicine in Houston, was 
awarded $200,000 plus attorney 
fees . The verdict came after a week 
of deliberations following a two-

VOTE: 
Sweet says move to 
Division II needed 
ContInued from ..... 11 
present at the April 28 meeting of 
the Academic Senate. 

Leventhal said he thinks it 's 
ridicu lous that the Representati ve 
Assembly mistrusts student voters' 
decisions-making abilities. 

"I think it 's amusing that some 
faculty members will trust students 
with their ground-breaking 
research at such a competitive 
institution, but they don ' t trust 
them to make the simple decision 
on whether or not to move to 
Division II ath letics," he said. 

According to UCSD Director of 
Alhletics Judy Sweet, who is also a 
former national president of the 
NCAA, the support of Ihe 
Academic Senate Representative 
Assembly is a clear message that it 
would be more appropriate for 
UCSD to move to Division II . 

She said that 15 Division III 
schools west of the Mississippi that 
UCSD competes against I.:urrently 
are small, private schools, with the 
exception of UC Santa Cruz. 

"Competing with public univer-
si ti es will generate more interest in 
our events 011 campus. We have 
greater identity with these confer-
ence school s," Sweet said . 

ACl.:ording to Leventhal , the 
sources of funds to support thi s 
move have yet to be decided. Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Joe 
Watson and Leventhal will meet 
nex t week to di scuss the ex isting 
options for thi s funding .

week trial. 
Pelletier, McTIgue and Davies all 

received their doctorates while con-
ducting research in the UCSD lab. 

Pelletier alleged that the misap-
propnallon of her academic 
research, which took place in 1993, 
prevented her from publishing her 
research, and that it prevented her 
from obtaining a faculty position at 
a good university. 

"I feel relieved - very happy," 
Pelletier said. " It is a victory. Now 
1 can go back and do what I do best 
- science." 

According to court testimony, the 
research stelen by the Agouron sci-
entists wa used to grow a three-
dimensional crystal of a protein 
called polymerase beta. This protein 
is an enzyme that cells use to repair 
DNA. 

Agouron hoped to use the pro-
tein to develop a drug to minimize 
the side effects of anti-cancer 
drugs. The project was unsuccess-

ful and dropped. 
"The verdict is ridiculous," said 

Donna Nichols, spokeswoman for 
Agouron. "This was a very difficult 
case scientifically. We believe the 
jury made the wrong decision." 

Daniel Mcleod, Pelletier's San 
Diego allomey, said McTigue was a 
scientific "mole that acted as a fer-
ret," repeatedly stealing trade secrets 
from the UCSD lab and giving them 
to her husband at Agouron. 

Agouron's attorney described 
Pelletier as a manipulative scientist 
who used an alleged personal rela-
tionship with the head of the UCSD 
lab to undermine McTIgue's efforts. 

In court testimony and records, 
Pelletier, 32, and Joseph Kraut, 72, 
the llCSD Biochemistry professor 
who then headed the lab, denied 
any such relationship. 

Initially, Pelletier requested 
UCSD to join her in the lawsuit. 
but the university declined. She 
then pursued the case on her own.

and Sciences, the nutrition 
department in the School of

School of Business 
Administration and the Kennedy 
School of Government. 

A fellow of the Harvard 
Institute fur International 
Development, Timmer has also 
held tenured professorships at 
Stanford University and Cornell 
University. 

"Peter TImmer is an enormous-
ly talented individual," said 
Marsha Chandler, senior vice 
chancellor for academic affairs. "[ 
am contident he will provide won-
derful and inspired leadership." 

Although he won't start work-
ing until August I, Timmer said 
he has already outlined his focus 
of study for the upcoming years.

said. "Latin America is finally

two decades, but connecting the

societies has proven difficult .

Warren Provost David Jordan 
said that the college deans and res-
ident deans met with Aguilar on 
Wednesday and will mcet with him 
again in July to discuss coordinat-
ing data reporting, 

"We' re working at gett ing num-
bers that are meaningful so we can 
then use them as a benchmark for 
the future." Jordan said. 

Like Drei linger, Jordan said that 
the dramatic increase in the number 
of cases rencct both a change in 
data collection and an increase in 
the real numbers of offenses. 

"I have a general sense that 
cases are increasing some," Jordan 
said.

reports should be available before 
the end of the summer.

"Earth Semester is like taking a semester abroad 
without ever leaving the country. You immerse 
yourself in three unique environments - social, 
geographic and intellectual - and come out w~h a 
different view of what environmental studies are all 
about." 

Michael Beman 
Earth Semester '98 
Sophomore 
Geology and Geophysics 
Yale University 

"Understanding the complex rules of life requires 
great vision. The potential at Biosphere 2 for teaching 
and learning about these phenomena is enormous. 
Earth Semester students are learning - from a team 
of physical. biological and social scientists - how the 
Earth and environment function. This approach is 
greatly needed in undergraduate education." 

Peter Raven, Ph.D. 
Director 
Missouri Botanical Garden 

"In most academic s~ttings, students are fed pages of 
processed data. This approach contrasts greatly with 
that utilized by the Biosph9re 2 educational 
programs, in which students become a part of a 
process for understanding how earth systems 
function. Industry needs a workforce that has this 
larger understanding." 

Phillip Dougherty, Ph.D. 
Forest Ecophysiologist 
Westvaco 

"At Biosphere 2, our students get an extraordinary 
education in the link between quantitative and 
qualitative thinking in an important area. This helps 
them - particularly our liberal arts majors - become

Seniors Bid Volleyball Farewell 
.. 

SPIKE: Senior leaders will be missed on the 
UCSD volleybaJl team 
By Steve Walsh 
Senior Staff Writer 

The seniors on the UCSD men 's 
volleyball team shou ld consider 
themselves victims of circum-
stance. They have been foreed to 
play in the most powerful Division 
I volleyball conference in the 
nation, one loaded with teams such 
as UCLA, Stanford, BYU and 
Hawaii , all of which challenge for 
the National Championship each 
year. 

This year's team was led by a 
group of four graduating seniors. 

Outside hiller Ryan Woods, who 
came to UCSD via com-
munity college, took over 
the position as the main 
offensive threat for the Tri-
tons. Following in the 
footsteps of greats such as 
Eric Mai and Tom Black, 
Woods responded by lead-
ing the team in kills and 
serving as the go-to player 
in crunch time. Against arch-rival 
La Verne, Woods was at his best, 
helping the Tritons to a crucial road 
win against the Leopards to close 
out the season. 

Jon Yarris, another junior col-
lege product, excelled in three 
seasons as a starter with the Tri -
tons. He was the emotional stabi -
lizer for the team. With Yarris in 
the lineup, UCSD Head Coach 
Duncan McFarland could count 
on stellar passing from the back-
row and a steady swing on

offense. 
A leader by example, Yam s was 

the epitome of hard work and class 
on the court. That leadership was 
evident off the court as well , as 
Yams played a criti cal role as a 
member of the Triton Athlete's 
Council. 

Game in and game out, it was 
middle blocker Guy Mount 's job to 
square off against front-line oppo-
nents that generally had a height 
advantage of nearly half a fool. 
Despite the height difference, 
Mount was extremely successful as 
a blocker and offensive option from 

the middle. Generally a 
very reserved player emo-
tionally, Mount was 
known for his trademark 
hand in the air following a 
stuff block. He also pro-
vided the most steady 
offensive attack, leading 
the team in kill percent-
age. 

In his first and only year as a 
member of the Tritons, Alan Daw-
ber made an immediate impact get-
ting quality playing time as middle 
blocker. An athletic player who 
may have been more adapt at a hit-
ter position, Dawber put the team's 
interests first by moving to the mid-
dle. 

Sharing starting duties through 
much of the season, Dawber used 
his quickness to make up for a 
height disadvantage and record a 
number of key blocks.

Rowin' UCSD Crew team rows in the Pacific Coast Rowing Championships. The Tritons had their best 
meet ever in this west coast challenge. 

Crew Seniors Row Into Sunset 
THEY'RE OFF: Crew says good-bye to all it's 
semor rowers 

By Kevin Mclaughlin 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

The most glori ous season in 
men's crew history just wrapped 
up. An undefeated regular season 
outside of Division I. the first major 
regalia title in the program's hi sto-
ry, and the Pacilic Coast Rowing 
Championship tro ph y were all 
bagged by the boys this year. 

But crew is a sport based on 
yea r-round conditi oning, 
so rest assured thi s squad 
wi ll continue to wear it out 
in the offseason. They had 
beller. as the men are los-
ing the number onc reason 
(or maybe number two, 
behind Head Coach Mike 
Fi lippone) for Iheir stell ar 
season: stroke oar Sam 
Nichols. 

Nichols has brought nothing but 
respect to the UCSD program in his 
four years here and through hi s 
hard work has brought nothing but 
accolades upon himse lf. 

Nichols earned a full chem ical 
engineering scholarship to UCLA's 
graduate program; his 3.72 GPA in 
this difficult fie ld exemplifies the 
student-athlete concept. 

"Obviously he wi ll be missed," 
Filippone said. "Our team would 
have been mi ssing a huge parI 
without him . He's definitely wor-
thy of a tremendous amount of 
resped." 

While the men 's squad will 
remain largely inlact, the women's 
side will lose a number of rowers. 

Among those departi ng La 10lla 
i ~ rower Adriane Wesse ls, a team 
captai n for the last two years. Wes-
sels has se rved four years with the 
team since her f, 'shman year, 
which is unusual in a sport with a 
very high attrition nile. 

"She was very instrumental in a 
lot of the team bui Iding the last 
couple of years." Head Coach Jack 
Vallcrga sa id. "A vcry good rower. 
A good unifying force in the boat." 

Another va luab le Triton who 
will be lost is thi s year's co-captai n 
and third-year rower Kati e Fu ller-
ton. Fu llerton was <In anchor (to the

with

team , not in the boating sense of 
the word) for a young lightweight 
squad that earned a wealth of 
medals this yea r, includ ing a pair of 
medals in the PCRCs. 

Two other women will be leav-
ing the dominant li ghtweight 
squad, which linished second on 
the West Coast this year. Reanna 
Courtney, abroad in Japan last year, 
returned fo r her thi rd season of 

crew and was on the lighl-
weight eight-seat boat that 
took second in the PCR Cs. 

Augusta Good, in her 
seco nd year of rowing, 
rowed well in the "engine 
room" of the light weight 
boat, shaking off a broken 
wrist from la I year and 
working undaunted 

through a tough rehab ilitation 
process on a joint that is crucial in 
the sport of row}ng. 

"She was a good demon. tration 
of guts," Vallerga sa id. 

Dcparting from Ihe varsity open 
team are two other valuable rowers. 
Third -year rower Alex Cornell and 
late-blooming second-year rower 
Laura Sanders are both departing, 
leaving open seats on both the var-
sity-eight and four-seat boats. 

Also movi ng on is fourth-year 
rower Adrienne Cunningham. Due 
to an ex tended study abroad in Aus-
tralia, the lightweight was unable to 
row thi ' spring. However, the 
member of the lightweight NCAA 
Tournament tcam of 1995 and the 
West Coast four-seat champs in 
1997 set a hi gh standard for those 
who fo ll owed. 

"She deserves a lot of credit for 
what Ihe lightweights did this 
year." Vallerga sa id. 

With so many moving on, the 
women will have some replace-
menl work to do. Yet th is is nothing 
new to crew, where people who 
can't slomach the ri gors of' a full 
season often drop oul.. With a big 
team and a strong coaching hack-
bone, the women should he able 10

upon the great performance of thi s 
season.

Baseball Sulks as Six Seniors Turn in Their Gloves 
SAD BUT TRUE: Four field players, including Triton standout, Mark Mason, and two pitchers, say goodbye to Triton Field 
Bf John MaYl*d 
Staff Writer 

Last month 's championship vic-
tory in their own UC San Diego 
Triton Classic marked the last col -
legiate game for six Tritons: 
George Escanuelas, Tony 
Lin, Mark Mason, Eri c 
Pangelinan, John Willi s 
and Theo Robins. 

Equally passionate about the 
game was team captain Mason. 
Undoubtedly the most recognized 
player on the team, Mason lead the 
Tritons not only on the fi eld at 
shonstop, but at the plate as well. 

"Eric exemplified the perfect 
first baseman," O' Brien said. "He 
was hard working and had a great 
attitude." 

Pangelinan, who was also a 
great base runner, had eight stolen 
bases thi s season, the second mo t 
for the Tritons. 

As four posit ion playe rs turned 
in their uniforms for good thi s sea-
son, ' two pitchers have done Ihe 
same. 

Though Willis still has a year of 
eligibility left , he will be graduat-
ing this quarter and thus end his 
career as a Triton. Though Willis 
didn ' t throw for a lot of innings this 
season, when he did, he was pro-
ducti ve, with no losses. 

Robins, recipient of the Coach-
es Award , is the other Triton pitch-
er UCSD will l11i ss nex t year. 
Though Robins was sidelined for a 
big pan or the season with a broken 

Last year, the Tritons 
graduated just three play-
ers. This year, they mourn 
the loss of twice as many 
outstanding veterans. 

"We' re losing not only 

Mason had the most 
homeruns (13), the highest 
slugging percentage 
(.819), the best on-base 
pereenlage (. 523) as we ll 
as Ihe most RBis (64). His 
.435 batting average, sec-
ond behind junior Ryan 
Hill , wa also impressive. 

"Mark deserve~ all the 
recognition he is getting," O' Brien 
said. "He was a phenomenal play-

six good ballplayers," Head Coach 
D:tn O' Brien said, "but good lead-
ers all around ." 

One of those leaders was left 
fie lder Escanuelas. The stout 
Escanuelas had another so lid year 
thi s season, fini shing with a .304 
balling average. Escanuelas also 
exhibited great speed around thc 
bags, leading the team with six-
tri ples. 

"George was surely one of the 
best !cad-off hitters," 0' Brien sa id. 
"I never hesi tated to pencil him in 
on the Iineu p. He workcd hard." 

Li n is another offensive power 
who is departing from the Triton 
lineup. As a designated hitler, the 
enthusiasti c Lin fini shed this year's 
campaign wi th a strong .368 bat-
ting average. 0 ' Brien was 1110s t 
impressed with Lin 's des ire to play.

said. "I loved to see how passionate 
he was aboullhe game." 

cr." 

Though Mason's co ll eg iate 
career is over, there arc still poss i-
bil iti es that Mason wi ll rake hi s 
skill s to the minor leagues. 

"Mark deserves a chance to play 
at the nex t level," 0' Brien said. " I I' 
he doesn' t gel picked up in Ihe 
amateur dmrt, I'll work wi th him 
unlil he does." 

Another posi tion player the Tri-
tons will lose is lirst baseman Pan-
ge linan. Pange linan, who SpCnl the 
first two yea rs or hi s co llege career 
in Long Beach, came to UCSD last 
year to ~ t a rt at li rst base. Pangcl i-

Off Five Top Seniors 
STARS: AU the s~niors proved to be an integral part of the 
Tritons successful 1997-1998 Women's Basketball campaign 
By Jeff Bassett 
Staff Writer 

Woody Hayes, Ohio State Uni versity'S 
legendary football coach, once said the fol-
lowing about numbers: "Statistics always 
remind me of the fellow who drowned in a 
river whose average deplh was only three 
feet." His point: Numbers do not tell 
the whole story. 

Generally speaking , I would 
agree with Hayes. Not only must he 
be legendary for a reason, but hardly 
a day passes when at least one of 
Sportscenter's cliche-prone anchor-
men do not get carried away with the 
numbers. Mark McGwire is nol 
going to hit 87 home runs; not too 
many people care about the difference in deci-
bels between thi s year's and last year's crowd 
at the Delta Center. 

But in the case of thi s past year's women's 
basketball team, the numbers tell much of the 
story. 

Th is yea rs squad was desc ribed by 
Coach Judy Malone as "the bes t ever." The 
numbers seem to ag ree. The team set 14 
records, some of the mo re impressive - 23 
wins, 16 siraight vic tori es and a winning 
percentage or 0.852. T he Tritons 1 0~ 1 j ust 
four games. emharrass ing many of their 
opponents en route to posting the nation's 
12t h best ma rgin of victory at 20.1 point s 
per game. The nu mbers clearl y attest to the 
women's tremendous season. 

The numbers also capture the spi rit of th is 
year's team. o r the 14 records set, onl y one 
was an ind ividual record - departing senior 
Tiannn Meri age 's 95 .7 percent free-throw 
shooting. The other 13 team records indicate 
the team-oriented style o f play. 

"The Ih ing Ihat has been so special about 
thi s year has heen the way we have: all played 
as a team." senior Kris ta Poehler said. "Every-
one, from the seniors on down to the fresh-
man. have worked logether. That. more than 
any other factor. is why we have bcen so suc-
cessfu l." 

While the overwhellTl ing majo ri ty or num-
bers tied to th is year's team [loi nt 10 success, 
there is onc ominous number which loo ms on 
the ncar horizon; the Sunday aner ncX l, the 
has ketball tea m will ol'lic ia ll y lose live 
seniors to graduation. 

The contri but ions and accompl is hme nts 
of Poehler. Summer Begley, Amy Franzen, 
Meri age and Karl i Jungwirth cannOI be 
overstated. Pue hl er. the tea m's cu- MVP 
along with junior Kate Turnbull , brought 
leadership and a will to win whi ch will be 
hard to repl ace. Her athleti cism toward the 
bucket and hanging jumpers wi II forever be 
etched in the minds of many of the Triton 
faithful. 

Beg ley made her li nal year count. Second 
on the leam in hoth scoring and rebounding, 
Begley was a consistent inside ror~e on both 
the offensive and defensive ends of the court. 
Freq uently outsized, Bc~ ley still managed to 
dictate thc game in the paint. 

Franzen, after a yea r's hialus in Scotland. 
returned to provi de stabi lity from the point 
guard posi tion. In an offense scheme whi t:h 
relied on ba ll movement, Franzen was instru -
mental in li ndi ng an open teammate. Defen-

I'll' 10 Ihe Triton n.:cortl book,. Jungwirth pro-

vided explosive scoring and rebounding 
which was hard t9 replace. 

More signilicant than their individual 
achievements was the winning attitude that 
the five seniors instilled. It is not a coinci-
dence that UCSO's tirst appearance in the 
NCAA postseason was thi s group's fresh-

man year. The next three yea rs also 
led to more of the same postseason 
appearances. These fabulous li ve 
leave UCSD with the most wins in 
Triton history, and have set the stan-
dard for those that follow. 

When asked for a senior quote, 
Amy Franzen's response was a quote 
by Helen Keller. "Keep your face to 
the sunshine and you cannot see the 

shadows." . 
Poehler (currently in Europe) will be ass is-

tant coach next year while Franzen plans to 
worK in biological research with future plans 
of going to graduate school for environmental 
management. Begley plans enter graduate 
school in the fall for literature. 

While these seni ors ce rtainly basked in 
the light during Iheir stay at UCSO, Ihei r 
exa mple will be reme mbered by a ll fUl ure 
players.

Two Top Golfers Leave UCSD 
ADIOS: The leaders of

By Shahin Rahlml

If il weren'l for Ihose pesky

excelled al Ihe Division III levc l for 

four yea rs.

Unl ... Up: Sen ior Greg Uberuanga lines up a putt. Greg s hot a

Head Coach Mike Wydra's squads. 
The players hang OUI off 'the golf 
course and Iheir learn unity reOecls 
Ihe good times they have each time 
on the links. 

While other teams rely on one 
or Iwo indi viduals to carry them 

to victory, Uberu aga and Byrd 
would ralher praise their fe llow 
teammates' pl ay and their contri -
bUlions. 

The 1998 regular season was 
anolher successful one fo r Ihe 
Tritons. Accumul ating an I I- I 
overall record , UCS D nOlChed a 
perfect 6-0 record against Divi-
sion III competiti on. Wydra's

Claire Schneider/ Guardian 
Swl..,...· Aw.Yo Jemery Byrd wallOps another 
drive down the fairway in his senior season. 

Heading into 
the Na ti onal 
Championships at 
l eckyll Island 
Golf Club III 
Georgia, the Tri-
tons looked to 
start the tourna-
ment with a fast 
starr. Ubemaga 's 
fi rs t-day 68 put 
him ahead of 
everyone else and 
helped the Tritons 
to a great first day. 
Melhod ist would 
eventuall y run 
away wilh the 
lournament, but 
the Tritons 
secured a so lid 
fi fth-place fini sh. 
Uberuaga finished 
with a plus-seven 
295 .while Byrd 

after 

rallied a 31 I. 
"Thai 6~ was definit ely the besl 

round of my career at UCSD: ' 
Uberuaga said. "My worst moment 
was back in my freshman year. I 
had just qualified for a malch on a 
Mond ay. I get to the range on Tues-
day, hit some ball s, go to d ass, I 
come back and my car is stolen. 
My brand-new set of go lf clubs 
were gone. Thai was delinitely not 
a good day but looking bal: k on it I 
guess it 's kind of funny. 

"In my four years play ing, I 
really enjoyed traveling with the 
team and the camaraderi e," Uberu -
aga added . 

Fellow senior Byrd echoed his 
tea mmates' semiments . . 

"My last year didn ' t tum OUI 
exaclly like I wa nled it to but I can 
look back on a great four years," 
Byrd said. "I wanted to do a lot in 
1998 and I guess my best round 
was the 73 f shot al Torrey Pines 
against Point Loma. The condi lions 
were lerrib le, but I was able to 
make the difference between a loss 
and a win. My worst moment was 
three years ago when I kind of for-
got to show up at the match. f just 
assumed I wasn't play ing. We ac tu-
ally had our indi vidual match-
streak ended" 

The Triton golf team will mi ss 
Byrd and Uberuaga in the worst 
way. Through the hard work and 
dedication they have shown in their 
four years, though, UCSD will 
once again challenge for a national 
title next season.

TRACK: Twenty 
great seniors leave their 
mark on UCSD track 
Continued from page 24 
53.86 seconds, second all-time 
fastest in UCSD history. 

Nexi year's squad will also have 
to find someone to lill the void that 
will be left by sprinters Juan Mag-
daroag and Kirk Miller. 

Magdaroag leaves behind an 
impressive career, ranking second 
all -time in school hi story in the 
IOO- meters and fo urth all-time in 
the 2oo-melers. 

Team captain Miller, the work-
horse of the men's team, prov ided 
the team wi th versat ilily and 
leaves as Ihe sc hool record holder 
in the 400-meter intermediate hur-
dles. 

Al so providing the team with 
versati lity was decathlete Matt 
Tregidga. Tregidga, who came to 
UCSD as a transfer student, was a 
key eompetilor for the Tritons in 
several meets th is year. 

Perhaps nowhere wi II the team 
lose more than in the distance squad. 
The Tritons will have to say goodbye 
10 several key runners that helped the 
leam throughoul the season. 

Among those thai will be 
mi ssed is Gavin Klinger. Though 
slowed by injuri es thi s season, 
Klinger ranks as Ihe lO p cross 
country runner in school hi story 
and was a two- time All American 
in the 5000 meters, ranking second 
all-time at UCSD in the event. 

"There was none better than 
Gavin," Van Arsdale said . "I hope 
10 have another one like him." 

The Trilons will also have to do 
withoul the services of Neal 
O' Bri en and Neal Harder. O' Brien 
had an impact in the 1500-meters, 
while Harder leaves Ihe team 
ranked seventh all-lime in the 
schoo l in the 5000-melers. 

Also leaving the team after thi s 
season is Soo-meter specia li st Jeff 
Copps, who was one of the hardest 
workers on the team. 

Matt Amero. also an SOO-meter 
speci ali st, was captain of the team 
in '95 and '96. Amero had one of 
the best campaigns of his career 
thi s season, qualifying fo r Nation-
als in the 800-meters as well as 
being the team's best 4oo- meter 
runner. 

"Matt is tremendously focused," 
Van Arsdale said. "He' ll succeed at 
anything he docs':" 

The team will also lose yet 
another competitor in the 800-
meters. Mike Wall ace was a very 
solid alhletc in Ihe event, and will 
leave Ihe team with the eighth-best 

time in UCSD's hi story, as well as 
the team's seventh best in the 1500-
meters. 

The team will also have to do 
without steeplechase speciali st 
Rich Erkkila, who provided Ihe 
team with many crucial points 
throughout Ihe season. 

In addition. Ihe Tritons nex t 
year will lose pole vaulter Vincent 
Geluco. Geluco, who did not par-
licipate on the team last season, 
came back this season wi th a 
fourth-place fini sh al the confe r-
ence championships. 

For the women's team, the loss-
es are nOI as massive bUI just as 
severe. 

The team will have to find 
someone who ·can replace Jennifer 
Gillis, who was without a doubt the 
workhorse of the women's team. 
She exce lled in five evems, and 
ranked as the team's best runner in 
the 200-meters. 

"Jenn came 10 the team as a , 
sophomore struggling 10 compete," 
Van Arsdale said, "but she made 
herse lf good because she wanled to 
be good and had the desire to be 
good." 

The career of Courtney Gray 
will nOI be forgotten anyti me soon 
Gray fi ni shed her career at UCSD 
with an All -American perfo rmance 
at Nationals in the 800-meters. She 
is also second all -time al UCSD in 
the 1500-meters. 

The team will have trouble next 
year replacing such athletes as Kiki 
Koenig and Amanda Wallace. 

As well as being a vital force for 
the cross country team, Koenig was 
an important pari of thi s year's 
Irack leam, while Wallace came to 
the team as a walk-on and bel:ame 
one of the team's most effective 
runners. 

"Amanda came 10 the leam 
wanling 10 be a pari of something 
and she ended up having an alfec i 
on everythi ng," Van Arsdale said . 

The Tritons were lucky to have 
Li ana Wright back for thi s season. 
Afler her firs t two seasons on the 
team, Wri ght had to mi ss all of 
las t season onl y to rerurn Ihis yea r 
to have I he best season of her 
career. 

"We never knew how much we 
needed her until we lost her last 
season," Van Arsdale said. "We all 
fe lt happy 10 have her back." 

The team will lose an intense 
co'mpetitor in Linda Bartee. !3artee 
was the team's specialist in jump-
ing evems: she competed in the 
long jump, high jump and the pole 
vault . Bartee ended her career wilh 
her besl competitive performance 
in the high jump at the conference 
championships.

The 
Coach 

'ravls Hili 
They Finally 
Kicked Me Out 

The final buzzer has sound-
ed. It's over. Finished. 

The Coach 's reign of sloven-
ly terror has breathed its last. 
That's right kids, this is my last 
column as editor of the 
Guardian's sports page. Now, 
now, let 's nOI cry. 

One thing 's for sure: it was 
one hell of a ride. I think I can 
speak for the entire sport staff 
when I say we had a lot of fun . 
Probably too much fun . 

That was our theme for the 
entire year. More than anything 
else, all of us were tired of the 
same old thing: attend game. 
Get quote. Get picture. Write 
story. Put it on page. We decid-
ed that if we were going to 
devote a significant chunk of 
time to reporting sports, we 
were going to do it our way. 

And you can bet your ass we 
did. 

Basically, the plan for this 
year was to break every rule 
possible and see what happened. 

. Suffice to say, I think we rai sed 
a few eyebrows, or at the very 
least, got a few cheap laughs. 

When the first issue took us 
until 3:30 a.m. to finish , I 
thought , "Screw this, I'm quit-
ting." But I stuck around, and 
thank God 1 did. As far as I' m 
concerned, this was the most 
unbelievable season of UCSD 
ath letics since I've been here. 

As fans, we were lucky to 
watch one of the greatest soccer 
dynasties in NCAA history, the 
three-time National Champion 
women. We were also treated to 
one of the most exciting sport-
ing events in UCSD history -
our women's volleyball squad's 
valiant come-from-behind vic-
tory in the NCAA National 
Championship game. I get chills 
just remembering the experi-
ence. 

I suppose this is the part 
when 1 give props to my right-
hand men: Jonah Nisenson and 
Kevin McLaughlin. Without 
you two, the page would have 
sucked. You guys kept me afloat 
all year. It didn't matter if I was 
at a Steeler game or battling my 
way through another hangover, 
you guys we're always ready to 
step up and "wreck shop," as 
Kev is fond of saying. 

And now, more sloppy good-
bye crap. 

To the good people at the 
athletic department, you run one 
of the tightest ships around, and 
you deserve a ton of credit. And 
for putting up with me this year, 
you deserve a 10 percent raise. 
I'm sure I must have rubbed all 
of you the wrong way at one 
time or another, but somehow, 
you put up with my ravings

TR.ITON 1997-1998 Awards Banquet 

By Travis HIli 
Sports Editor 

They got up early ; they had two 
grue ling practices a day ; they 
pushed themselves to their limit -
and went beyond it; they studied 
for midterms still covered in the 
sweat from games - in sum, they

night , they were recognized. 

"They" would of cour e be 
UCSD's contingency of superb ath-
letes and coaches, and the recogni -
tion took place at the annual UC 
San Diego Intercollegiate Athletics 
1997-98 Year in Review banquet at

It was a gala affair, as over 450 
athletes, students, a lumn~ parents, 
faculty and special guests crowded

"The word is spreading," Direc-
tor of Athletics Judy weet said, 
describing the dinner. " It seems 
that now everyone wants to be a 
part or thi s event." 

Among the trophies and banners 
were two National Championship 
- one belonging to the women's 
soccer team , the other to the 
women ' volleyball team. 

But those two teams' accom-
plishments were only part of the 
highlights, as Sweet opened the

Triton Track Says Good-Bye To Seniors 
FAREWELL: 20 supe-
rior seniors hang up 
their spikes for UCSD 
By S.ul Sherldlln 
Staff Writer 

One cannot truly appreciate the 
vital role that the UCSD track and 
field team seniors play by simply 
reading the score ummaries of 
every week. 

Their responsibilities involve 
more than just giving their best to 

earn the team as many points as 
possible. The seniors' role i .. to 
teach what they have 
learned over the years to 
the less-experienced ath-
letes. They are the ones 
who are counted on to g t 
the crucial wins when the 
meet is on the line. The 
seniors' role is to lead by 
example. 

The seniors on this 
year's track and field team, the 
seniors will leave behind some very 

large shoes for next year's team to 
fill. Those graduating include three 

Nationals qualifiers and 
two All-Americans, not to 
mention several CCAA 
Championship winners 
and a handful of school 
record holders. 

Perhap no senior was 
more successful this year 
than team captain Dave 
Spector. Spector finished 

third at Nationals in the pole vault 
with a personal best mark of 16'3", 

earning him All-American honors. 
"Spector is a man who does 

exactly what he says he is going to 
do," Head Coach Ted Van Arsdale 
said. "He said all year long that he 
was going to set a personal best at 
Nationals and he did just that." 

Joining Spector at Nationals 
was runner Tim Prudence. Pru-
dence dominated on the track all 
year long, winning the 400-meter 
intermediate hurdles at the confer-
ence cb.mpionships with a time of'
