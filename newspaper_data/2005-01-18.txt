Study: Preuss School students 
do not outperforlll some peers 

By CHRlmNE CLARK 
Contributing Writer 

Preuss School students did not 
perform statisticaUy better on stan-
dardized tests or po t significant 
improvements in grades compared 
to those students who applied to 
the campus-run charter school but 
were not admitted, according to a 
comparison study done last year. 

Last year, 90 percent of the 
school 's first graduati ng class 
received offers of admi ion from 
four-year universitie - the major-
ity from C campu es and presti-
gious private schools like tanford 
and the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology. However, when con-
tra ted with a group of students 
with similar socioeconomic back-
ground who applied to the school, 
the spring 2004 rudy indicated 
that there were few tati tical dif-
ferences between the group . 

"On the California tandard-
ized tests, tudents in the 10th 
grade at Preuss School and the 
comparison group recorded nearly 
identical cores," the study stat.:s. 

Founded in 1999 as a UC D-
administered charter middle and 
high chool, the Preuss chool is 
designed to increase diversity in 
higher education. The school is 
made up of mostly underrepre-

sented minorities. 
The Preuss School 1lllSSlOn is 

"to improve educational practices 
and provide an intensive college 
preparatory school for low-
income student populations, 
which are historically underrepre-
sented on the campuses of the 
University of California." 

Srudents are admitted to 
Preu s School via lottery. To be 
eligible for the lottery, they mu t 
qualify for a school low-income 
meal-assistance program, come 
from a family with no college 
graduates and have good academ-
ic standing. 

Conducted by the university's 
Center for Resea rch on 
Educational Equity, s e sment 
and Teaching Excellence, the 
study compared Preuss' current 
students to other applicants who 
met the chool's entrance criteria 
but were not selected to attend. 
The srudy found no significantdif-
ferences between the two groups' 
performance on an annual state 
exam or high school grade . 

"What the analysis shows so 
far is that Preuss students have 
about the same GPA as the control 
group, and test scores that are the 
same or, in a few subjects, signifi-
cantly higher," said economics 
professor Julian Betts, who serves 

on the Preuss School Board of 
Directors and helped to create the 
study. 

The study noted that Preuss 
students performed markedly bet-
ter on the history portion of the 
state exam and had completed 
more required college-preparato-
ry courses by the lOth grade. 

"The comparisons about 
course-taking reveals some signi fi -
cant difference, but the standard-
ized course results are not signifi-
cantly different," Preuss School 
Principal Doris Alvarez said. 

Betts explained that the study 
compared Preuss students and 
applicants instead of doing a 
wider comparison to a random 
group of student within the 
same socioeconomic demograph-
ics. Therefore, the numbers may 
not reflect the achievement of 
average students, who may have 
di ffferent levels of motivation 
and enthusiasm from that of all 
Preuss applicants, no matter 
where they actually attended, 
according to Betts. 

"If we randomly selected stu-
dents enrolled in the regular 
schools who had the same, say, 
background regarding race and 
parental education, it might not be

Rain may delay center construction 
By MARNETTE FEDERIS 

Senior Staff Writer 

Recent storms that pounded 
. Southern California in December 

and January have also temporarily 
halted the first phase of construc-

~on of the Student Center expan-
sIon. 

The construction, which is part 
of a growth plan for both Student 
Center and Price Center, was 
already approximately eight days 
behind by the end of December. 

"No one was expecting this 
amount of rain," Project Manager 
and architect Pnina Goldberg stated 
in an e-mail. "As much as we need 
the rain, it is not good for construc-
tion. We are hoping that we will be 
able to gain some momentum and 
make up some of the lost days, but 
at this moment we don't know." 

San Diego has seen as much as 
four more inches of rain than what 
has been recorded in the past few 
years, according to National 
Weather Service of San Diego 
forecaster Stan Wasowslc.i. 

The delays are not expected to 
drasticaUy alter the schedule for 
the Student Center expansion as a 
whole, which is scheduled for 
completion in April 2006. 

University Centers Advisory 
Boar d has not expressed great 
concern about a significant delay, 
according to UCAB Chair Jessica 
Kort. 

Billy Wong/Guatdian 
Stormy delay: Recent and unexpected heavy storms in Southem Califomia may 
cause further delays in the construction of new Student Center buildings. 

"I don't believe that at this 
point we're in any position to teU 
if rain wiU significantly delay the 
project," Kort said, "We would 
have to adjust or re-adjust moving 
in, if, in the future, we can't catch 
up. But it hasn 't been brought up 
as a specific cQJIcern." 

The regular rainy season from 
January to March wiU lilc.ely bring 
more heavy rains, Wasowslci stated. 

"We're expecting a continua-
tion of the pattern just like in the 
beginning of the month: heavy 
rajns first and a dry spell for a 
week or so, but with more rain 
later," Wasowski said. 

Even with clearer skies in the 
past week, Goldberg said that wet 
soil in the construction area will 
limit the progress of the work. 
During this time, Straub 

Construction, the contractor for the 
project and the university, has been 
inspecting the ground for its safety. 

"There is a limited amount of 
work we can do with heavy equip-
ment when the ground is muddy 
and soaking wet, as it is when we 
have partial foundation," Goldberg 
stated. "The main activity you will 
see on the site now is pumping out 
the water, stabilizing any trenches 
cut or fiUed before the stonn and 
preventing any mudslide. " 

The storms hit while the project 
was in a critical stage of establishing 
the foundation for the facility. 
Other stages to follow include 
working outside the foundation and 
construction of the interior, which 
wiJ] house the new Women's

Medication deaths rise in start 
of month, new report finds 
By CHARLES NGUYEN 

Staff Writer 

In the first days of every month, 
mortality rates due to medication 
errors increase as much as 25 per ent 
above nom13l, according to a new 
study by sociology professor David 
Phillips and a group of co-authors. 

Published in the January issue of 
the medical journal PhamlflCotherapy, 
Phillips' report used computerized 
death certificates from the National 
Center for Health Statistics as data. 

He ascribed the early month 
death rate increase partly to phar-
maceutical errors. 

"Government assistance pay-
ments to the old, the sick and the 

poor are typically received at the 
beginning of each month. Because 
of this, there is a beginning-of-the-
month spike in purchases of pre-
scription medicines," Phillip said 
in a university announcement. 
"Pharmacy workloads go up and -
in line with both evidence and 
experience - error rates go up as 
well. Our data suggest that the 
mortality pike occurs at least part-
ly because of this phenomenon." 

From almost 132,000 cases of 
fatalities involving accidental poison-
ing by prescription drugs, the study's 
authors found that, while only 3.2 
percent of the accidental deaths were

State among leaders for 
public college spending 

By ANGELA YAG 
Staff Writer 

Despite the state's budget 
deficits and CUts to higher educa-
tion, California placed among the 
leading states in public university 
spending for the 2004-05 fiscal 
year, ranking fifth in the nation, 
according to · a new report pub-
lished by an education think tank. 

Based upon total tax appropria-
tions, the report found that 

California saw a 7.5-percent over-
aU increase in higher public-educa-
tion spending last year. The state 
trails only Florida, Virginia, New 
Jersey and New York in pending 
for public universities. 

In aU 50 states, state tax appro-
priations for higher education bud-
gets rose by 3.8 percent from last 
year. The growth contrasted with a 
2.I-percent cut in higher education

I BRIEFLY 
Service to help with 
tsunami aid relief 

The Associated Students-run Volunteer 
Connection has partnered with a San Diego 
nonprofit group on a new campus- and city-
wide relief project. The program will provide 
emergency relief supplies to those devastated 
by the destruction caused by the December 
tsunami in Southeast Asia. 

The volunteer service hopes to collect 
5,000 pounds worth of emergency supplies to 
fill a San Diego World Response plane that will 
fly the goods from San Diego to Sri Lanka at the 
end of the month. 

Students and others can contribute the 
needed supplies - which include iodine, rub-
bing alcohol, digital thermometers, gauze pads, 
bandages and latex gloves - at the Volunteer 
Connection office on the second floor of Price 
Center or at a donation box at Student Health 
Service. 

Bush calls for expansion of 
Pell Grant, program changes 

Unveiling his higher education and iob-train-
ing plans at a Florida community college in 
Jacksonville, Fla., President Geor~e W. Bush 
said he would ask Congress to Increase the 
maximum Pell Grant by $500 over the next five 
years and make other changes to federal finan-
cial aid. 

In addition to increasing the maximum aid 
by $100 eachJear for the next five years, Bush 
said he woul again ask Congress to imple-
ment his enhanced Pell Grant program, which 
would offer an extra $1 ,000 for high school stu-
dents who take challenging courses. 
Lawmakers deleted the program from the final 
appropriations package in Bush's previous bud-
get proposal. 

Bush said the federal government would 
pay for the increased costs by changing the 
way the government admin isters its student 
loan programs, though he did not offer any 
specifics. 

'We've got a unique way of saving money, 
and that saved money from the administration 
of the student loan program will be plowed into 
the Pell Grant program," he said, adding that 
the savings would also cover a $4.3-billion 
deficit in the Pell Grant program's current bud-
get. 

In the past. Republican members of 
Congress have proposed forbidding students 
from consolidatin8 student loans - essentially 
refinancing them Into one when interest rates 
are low - as a way to save money for the gov-
ernment. 

In the 2000 election, . Bush had also 

promised to increase Pell Grants, but fell short 
of his goal during his first term. The maximum 
grant nas remained at $4,050 over the past 
three years. 

Democrats propose 
additional student aid 

Democratic congressmen have announced 
a new higher education plan, which they say 
offers a better a~ernative to the policies of the 
Bush administration. 

Labeling the budget approved by the 
Republican-<lominated Congress late last year 
as "misplaced priorities in education: 
Democrats have said their plan would make 
college more affordable. 

Under the plan, the maximum Pell Grant 
would grow from $4,050 to $5,800 this year 
and tax credits for students attending college 
would double, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-
Mass.) announced on behalf of the party. 

In addition, the proposal would allow stu-
dents to consolidate loans more than once to 
take advantage of lower interest rates and elim-
inate the origination fees lenders currently 
charge borrowers when they take out loans. 

It would also forgive the loans of graduates 
who commit to teaching for five years in high-
poverty schools or work in other public-seMce 
fields that have experienced personnel short-
ages. 

To pay for the programs, Democrats said 
they would encourage universities to switch to 
the government's Direct Loan program, which a 
recent report from the Congressional Budget 
Office estimated would save the government 
$12.3 billion over the next decade. 

Congressional Republicans said the CBO 
report was inaccurate and its methodology dis-
torted the true costs of the program. 

Researchers discover way 
to age juvenile heart 

UCSD scientists have uncovered a method 
for transforming hearts of juvenile mice into 
adult hearts that are capable of increased work-
loads. 

Published in the joumal Cell, the study iden-
tified a protein enzyme responsible for heart 
contraction and tissue growth. Levels of the 
protein in mice affected their heart develop-
ment. 

"The cascade of molecular events that we 
have uncovered are directly relevant to under-
standing heart physiology during development 
and may provide insiRhts into mechanisms that 
directly contribute to 'heart attacks in humans: 
cellular and molecular medicine professor 
Xiang-Dong Fu said.

a valid comparison group because 
we don't know if these students have 
the same motivation, work ethic, 
etc., as students who actually 
applied to Preuss," he stated in an e-
mail. "Because the lottery is ran-
dom, we have a control group that is 
not only closely matched on demo-
graphics but also closely matched on 
all unobservable characteristics." 

Logistical conditions for the 
study have made a wider compari-
son difficult, according to Cecil A. 
Lytle, Thurgood Marshall College 
provost and chair of the Preuss 
School Board of Directors. 

~'The C.R.E.A.T.E. team experi-
enced imperfect data from San 
Diego Unified chool District 
regalllin the whereabouts and 
progress of the cohort group of stu-
dents," lytle said . "By agreement, 
we rely heavily upon the local 

school district to track the cohort 
.group, but it is the case that district 
records were spotty due to imper-
fections in their tracking system." 

Alvarez also said the methodol-
ogy used in the study made its find-
ings inconclusive. 

"J feel the study compares so 
few students in the comparison 
group that it is not a very reliable 
method of comparison, yet I think 
we need a larger sampling before 
we can make a good analysis," she 
said in an e-mail. 

[n any case, the school's admin-
is tration remains optimistic about 
what future studies \vill (eveal, she 
said. C. R.E.A.T.E. will be able to 
do a more comprehensive study at 
the end of this year. 

"By way of a recently approved 
grant, they will be capable of track-
ing the cohort group and not have 
to rely solely on the San Diego 

school district's abilities to track 
the cohort," Lytle said. 

The study will also be able to 
compare the college attendance 
rates between Preuss students and 
the ' comparison group. BettS said 
he feels Preuss students should fare 
better in the new study. 

"My expectation - and at this 
point, it really is just specuJation -
is that the students in the compari-
son group will have a quite impres-
sive attendance pattern as well , 
beca use we know that they are 
highly motivated ," Betts said . "But 
on the basis of the gap in [course) 
completion rates we noticed for 
this cohort by the end of the grade 
10, it stands to reason that Preuss' 
student will have higher college-
attendance rates." •

Rain: Weather service predicts more storms

well as meeting rooms, a snJdent 
lounge and a new restaurant. 

"If the rain would have come as 
predicted - end of January - we 
would have been out of the founda-
tion, this would have been much 
easier to incorporate into a working 
schedule," Goldberg stated. 

According to Goldberg, the uni-
versity and Straub Con~truction are 
continuing to work together to 
complete the project as planned. 

"(Straub Construction) ~ill try 
their best to finish on schedule, or 
even cut days from the scheduJe," 
he said. "If they need the addition-
al time, both parties lose . ... Both 
parties want to finish on time." 

In spring 2003, students passed 

a referendum agreeing" to pay fees 
to cover the reconstruction and 
expansion of both Price Cen ter and 
Student Center. The part of the 
expansion that is covered by the 
student fee includes the creation 
of a student lounge\ meeting rooms 
and a new restaurant. 

According to University Centers 
director Gary Ratcliff, delays for the 
project will not impact the student 
fees. The main concern would be the 
organizations that are planning to 
relocate to the new facility, he said. 

"We want to get these offices 
moved into the facility as soon as 
possible," he said. 

The LGBTRO, temporarily 
housed ina trailer across from 
Gilman Parking Structure, is in the 
process of preparing to move to its 
permanent offices, scheduled to 

open in August 2005. 
"We know very well that you 

can't control rains," said Debbi 
Blake, assistant to the LGBTRO 
director. "There has been no real 
conversation of delays. We're just 
going with the flow and hopefully 
will be able t.o move into new space 
when we can." 

Director of the Women's Center 
Emelyn Delapena said she is also 
hoping that the center will be able 
to move into the facility in the fa ll. 

"We've already downsized, gotten 
rid of a lot of stuff," Delapena said. 
"As we get closer. to the acrual move-
in, we will have meetings with our 
constituents to see what they want 
the facility to look and feel like. "

that places it 39th in the nation 
for growth over the same time 
period. 

"In short , California has still 
not caught up with reductions 
uffered in the last recession," 

said Illinois State Universi ty pro-
fessor Jame C. Palmer, editor of 
the study. 

That means the amount of 
money the sta te is pa yi ng to state 
colleges in the current budget is 
lower than the appropriations of 
three years ago, he said. 

Almost all of the increases in 
California's higher education 
spending between 2004 and 2005 
can be attributed to an increase in 
appropriations for community 
colleges. Funds for all other sec-
tors actually declined, according 
to Palmer. 

"But again, the increase to the 
community colleges comes in the 
wake of prior declines," Palmer 
said. 

Despite the numbers, the 
state's rankings are steadily slip-
ping over the long term, accord-
ing to UC Student Association 
President Jennifer Lilla. Though 
voter-approved Proposition 98 
guarantees that a certain percent-
age of the state's budget will go to 

fund K- l2 education and com-
muni ty coll eges, the statc's [WO 
university systems uo not enjoy 
the sa me protections and ha ve 
been hurt over the last severn I 
years, she sa id. 

"We may have the fifth rank-
ing for the Ia t budget year; but 
look at the two-year and fi ve-year 
numbers, we're not evcn close to 
being fifth 111 the nation," Lilla 
said. "Over the last 1\ e I'ca r ', 
Ca lifornia fundin~ to highc~ edu-
cation has been slipping dra;tica l-
Iy. And even Proposition 98 C'1 n 
be suspended by the Legislature 
in times of financi al cri is."

America's loss a gain for rest of world 
United States should ease requirements. for international student visas 

By MARYANN KIMOTO 
Contributing Writer 

Consider the following sce-
nario: A student is obliged to pay 
$100 to have personal information 
stored in an electronic database for 
the purpose of government moni-
toring. Then that student earns the 
right to pay an additional $120 for 
a three-month wait to apply for 
off-campus work - but only under 
the most extreme financial duress. 
Criminil? Hardly, unless having a 
certain major or place of birth is a 
crime. Such is the world of post-
9/11 student-visa applicants. 

International students who 
wish to study in the United States 
must not only undergo the incon-
venience of personal interviews 
and various applications and fees, 
but have also become suspect on 
other issues, such as red-tagged 
majors. The U .S. State 
Department can put a "special 
hold" on visa applications from 
international students who take 
courses on nuclear engineering, 
lasers and electronic guidance sys-
tems. 

Other fields on the "technology 
alert list" - created in 2000 by the 
U.S. government to prevent the ille-
gal exchange of technological 
knowledge with military implica-
tions between nations - hit much 
closer to home. Chemical, biotech-
nology and biomedical engineering 
are all subjects screened by the U .. 
government because they can be 
linked to biological weaponry and 
involve specialties such as virology, 
pharmacology and toxicology. 

Sound fami liar? With an ever-
expanding list of sibjects on the 
alert list, the tide of paranoia 
sweeping the country can almost 
be considered tangible. 

While screening the student 
visa pool may initially seem like a 
good idea (given that one of the 
9/ 11 hi jackers held a student visa at 
the time of the attack), over-regu-
lated visa procedures imposed 

upon international students have 
served more as a deterrent to 
would-be learners than to killers. 
After all, how much respect can 
one expect from students from 
countries such as North Korea, 
Syria, Sudan, Iran, Libya and other 
nations labeled by the U .S. 
Department of State as "state 
sponsors of terrorism," when such 
students are made to fill out sup-
plemental forms that ask "Do you 
have any specialized skills or train-
ing, including firearms, explosives, 
nuclear, biological or chemical 
experience?" 

While the effort is sincere, is it 
reasonable to expect that a terror-
ist will calmly and truthfully 
recite arms experience to a wea-
ried administrator? On the flip 
side, how many resources can be 

const ructive 
anti-terrorist 
measures when 
so much time and 
effort is already 
going toward the 
interviews and 
eva 1-

funneled 

/ 

uations of almost all international 
students? 

To take an example of a group 
of foreign students impacted by 
the rules, Middle Eastern under-
graguate- and graduate-student 
rates at UCSD have dropped from 
4.6 percent of the total interna-
tional student body in 2000-01 to 
only 2.1 percent in 2001-02, and 
3.6 percent in 2002-03. The inter-
national-student growth rate in the 
nation as a whole has slowed con-
siderably, but not due to lack of 
interest. CNN reported last year 
that countries like the United 
Kingdom and Australia have bene- ' 
fited from aversive U .S. student-
visa policies and have seen their 
international student enrollment 
rates rise. And that loss is great 
indeed.

exposure 
Marianne Madden 

Oh, what a difference a car makes. To think - for two yea rs, [ put up with the 
humiliation and horror of walk-
ing, riding the shuttle, and 
(luning my life in the hands of the 
maniacal drivers who nudged 
their bumpers against m y thighs 
as [ traversed crosswalks at a trot. 

ow J'm the master of my fate 
and the captain of the road - a 
bona fide Southern California dri-
ver. Damn the pansy-ass rules of 
Northern California, where I 
lOoled my way to a permit and 
h(cnse at 25 miles per hour, 
forced into submission by the vise 
gri ps of the law and common 
sense. Driving in Southern 
California i the real deal, and my 
initiation on San Diego's roads 
threw open the door to a brave 

new world - a world of refusing 
to let pesky obstacles like curbs 
and double-yellow lines stand 
between me and my destination; 
of passing people early and often; 
of taking speed limits only as 
vague suggestions. But that only 
scratches the surface of what I've 
learned over the past few months. 
There's much more: 

Changing Lanes 
N07'CII/: Blink for at least five 

seconds, wait for an opening in 
traffic and change lanes. 

So Cui: There will never be an 
opening in traffic, so create one 
by nosing into the desired lane 
while shooting dirty looks to the 
person you're cutting off. Turn 
signals are for wimps. 

Parking 
NorCII/: Park only in designat-

ed parking spots, and watch the 
parking brake and angle of your 
tires when parking on a hill. 

SoCIII: See a patch of pavement 
. not already occupied by a car? 
Lucky you - you've found a park-
ing spot. Does the spot happen to 

be in the middle of the road? No 
'problem - just flick on your haz-
ard lights and walk away. 

Speeding • 
NorCol: Cops are everywhere, 

so you're busted if you drive more 

" Damn the pansy,ass rules 
of Northern California, 

where I tooled my way to 
a permit and license at 25 

'le 110 " 1m sper ur ... 

than 5 mph above the speed limit. 
So Cui: Go 5 mph over the 

speed limit and the cops will run 
you over in their rush to bust their 
next "bad guy." 

Traffic lights 
NorCIII: Speed through the 

intersection if the light turns yel-

low. 
SoCII/: Speed through the 

intersection if the light turns red. 

Residential streets 
NorCal : Never drive over 25 

mph, and watch out for children 
and other obstacles. 

SoCII/: Go at least 60 mph, 
knowing that no child with any 
sense of self-preservation will 
venture within 10 feet of the 
street. 

Driving in the rain 
NorCal: Turn on wipers and 

proceed at a reduced speed. Be 
thankful it isn't snowing. 

SoCa/: Slow down to 15 mph, 
frantically try to remember how 
to operate windshield wipers and 
swerve madly. 

Dealing with heavy traffic 
NorCa/: Keep a safe distance 

from the person in front of you 
and violently slam on the .brake if 
you catch any glimpse of brake 
lights in front of you. 

SoC"I: ~ide the bumper of the 
person in front of you at 90 mph. 

Commuting to work 
NorCa/: Ride Bay Area Rapid 

Transit (BART) to work. [t 's the 
social ly conscious method of 
transportation, and the urine 
smell really perks you up in the 
morning before you slurp down 
your lane. 

SoCa/: Spend at least two hours 
per day commuting to and frol\1 
work. If your commute doesn 't 
regularly feature gridlocked traffic 
and induce pounding on your 
wheel, swearing, and finally cry-
ing in frustration , find a route that 
does. Only then will you become a 
true Southern Californian. 

Pedestrians 
NorClI/: Pedestrians have the 

right-of-way and cars will yield 
for them. 

SoCa/: Crossing the street sig-
nifies a pedestrian's wish to die. 
Treat them accordingly by sum-
marily running them over. 

Other drivers 
NorCII/: Drive with the speed 

See COLUMN, Puge 5 

TUESDAY, JANUARY 18,2005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Column: Cars mean more than transpordon 
concinued /rom page 4 

of traffic and don 't drive in any-
one's blind SpOt. 

SoCII/: Other drivers exist sole-
Iyas barriers to where you wish to 
go. Weave around them, angrily 
screaming and gesturing at them 
as you do so. 

In-car entertainment 
NorCII/: Entertain and educate 

yourself as you drive by listening 
to NPR. 

SoCa/: Entertain yourself as 
you drive by watching the 12-inch 
TV mounted on your dashboard. 

Family-mobiles 
NorCII/: Mommies run you 

over in Volvos while driving their 
daughters to soccer practice so 
they can be the next Mia Hamm. 

SoCII/: Mommies run you over 
in Suburbans and Expeditions 
while driving their daughters to 
acting lessons so they can be the 
next Hilary Duff. 

Status symbols 
NorCu/: Broadcast your success 

with a black Mercedes or BMW 

with Stanford or UC Berkeley 
vanity plates. 

SoCal: Broadcast your success 
with a mustard-yellow Hummer 
with five dead pedestrians artfully 
arranged on the hood. 

Washing your car 
NorCa/: Scrub away in your 

driveway on a Saturday, or just 
wait until the next rainstorm to 
rinse off the bird crap and drifts of 
pollen. 

SoCIII: This is La Jolla, so pay a 
crew of uniformed illegal immi-
grants to wash your car by hand . 
Refuse to tip because Pedro 
missed a spot when drying your 
bumper. 

Bumper stickers 
NorCul: A Howard Dean stick-

er in the window is absolutely 
necessary. "Keep Santa Cruz 
Weird" stickers are allowed, but 
only if you're college-aged and 
drive a shitty Honda. If you 're 
over 30, "Keep Tahoe Blue" is the 
tre'ndy option, e~pecially when on 
a hybrid vehide. 

SoCIII: No car is complete 

without a Bush/Cheney '04 stick-
er vying for attention amid your 
"We Will ever Forget" sticker, 
half-dozen yellow-ribbon stickers, 
and "My child is a marginally suc-
cessful student at Whitman 
Elementary" bumper sticker. 

Vehicle mods 
NorCu/: Have some extra cash? 

Own a foreign-made car that's not 
nearly "sick" enough to "impress 
the bitches"? Think you're a 
bad ass? Go nuts with an obnox-
ious decal, a lowering kit and 
chrome rims. Your homies will 
give you extra props if the money 
you spend on mods exceeds the 
amount your parents paid for your 
car. 

SoCu/: Ditto, except 45-year-
old women with PT Cruisers are 
fair game for mods also. Drive a 
car that looks like a raisin? 
Fantastic - add some flowery 
contrast detailing and blinding 
rims to make sure everyone with-
in a five-mile radius knows you're 
an idiot with no taste.

WESDAY, JANUARY 18,2005 

Study: Cause of monthly 
death spike undetermined 

continued from page I 
a result of hannfuI effects from cor-
rectly administered prescriptions. 
96.S percent of fatalities were due 
either to ingestion of the incorrect 
drug or unintentional overdose. 

The results excluded suicide and 
homicide cases involving intention-
al poisoning. 

Phillips and hiS co-authors also 
found that the monthly spike in 
deaths remained constant across 
age and socioeconomic groups. 
suggesting that it was not the result 
of increased consumption by peo-
ple receiving government aid. 

"People relying on government 
funds would purchase their medi-
cines at the beginning of the month 
when they receive their payments," 
Phillips said. uSince the results did 
not show any different death rates 
for the government-aided patients. 
it makes it more likely pharmacists 
are involved in the error." 

However. the lack of details in 
the report leads to questions over 
who exactly is to blame for medicinal 
errors. according to Stephen M . 
Setter. an assistant professor of phar-
macotherapy at Washington State 
University and spokesperson for the 
American Pharmacists Association. 

"The study is not detailed enough 
to make a direct correlation with 
'medication errors' and an increase in 
fatalities." Setter said. "For instance, 
the definition of 'medication error' is 
quite broad and may include a 
patient unintentionally overdosing. 
That is not a pharmacy error but 
rather an error made after the pre-
scription has left the pharmacy." 

Other patient errors may also 
account for the fatalities. Setter 
said. Patients visiting the emer-
gency room. where they may not 
have access to relevant information. 
may not know their own allergies 
or current medications. leading to 
reactions wi th emergency drugs. 

Phillips said that while he agreed 
the source of tlle deaths is 
unknown, the study suggests that 
precaution should be ~ken in all 
areas of prescription drugs. 

"We don't know who actually 
makes this error. It could be the 
pharmacist. it could be patient, it 
could be doctor or it could be 
nurse," he said. "Increasing pharma-
ceutical staff temporarily at the 
beginning of the month would help. 
Patients should also double·check 
their medications at the beginning of 
the month and know what and how 
much medication they are taking." 

While the report is not detai led 
enough to pinpoint exact solutions. 
further research is needed on the 
intriguing results. Setter said . 

"The problem is not defined 
enough to solve." he said . 
"Nonetheless the data are very inter-
esting. More detailed studies need to 
be done to identify the factors asso-
ciated with or causing the spike." 

Health economist for the 
National Association of Chain 
Drug Stores Laura Miller echoed 
Setter's opinion on the study. 

''It·s a lot of good raw data and a 
good start." she said. "But this is tlle 
beginning of something, rather than 
[anything] conc1usory. Cause of 
death for patients is not a c1ear·cut 
thing, and whether it is an overdose, 
suicide or any rype of deatll can Ix: 
arbitrary depending on the persun 
filling out the death certificate." 

Phillips decided to conduct the 
study after reviewing initial numbers. 
showing the spike in deaths. he said. 

"I wondered what kind of death 
spiked the largest. and I knew some 
poorer people cannot afford medi-
ci nes except at these beginning 
times of the month, so I followed 
that lead," Phillips said. 

Phillips and his co-authors, wh o 
included former UCSD under-
graduate student Jason Jarvinen 
and executive director of Tuft 
Health Care Center Rosalie 
Phillips - his sister - previousl y 
published other studies together, 
including one showing that cardiac 
fata lities increase during Christmas 
time and New Year's .

FrancIIco, UCSD provtdet the head-
quarters for the eeientiflc research

ness of medicinal callnabls in treating 
tennlnally III patients. . 

The f8ci1ity, which shares the office of 
UCSO's HIV Neurobehavioral Research 
Center in Hltlcteat, .... patients diag-

cancer, HIV and multiple ICIeroals, and 
prescribes medicinal cannabis to test its 
efIIcacy for treatment. 

Andrew Mattison, assistant director 
of the center. said the main priority at 
CMCR is safety and efIiciency. 

"(We want] to provide symptomatic 
relief for medical conditions that regular 
medications woo't help," Mattison said. 

There has been surprisingly little 
investigation of the effects of marijua-
na. and facilities such as the CMCR 
are working to uncover the effects of 
the drug. 

Cannabis has been effective at 
relieving the symptoms of some 
patients. It can alleviate the pain, nau-
sea, vomiting and lo.s of appetite 
caused by such serious illnesses as 
cancer and HIV. 

However, there are hazards 
involved. such as lung damage from 
smoking and low birth weight in babies 
born to cannabis users who smoked 
while they were pregnant.

SISTER 
'SISTER 

A mong the nameless crowds that wander the campus, identical 
twins Shemia and Sheme're 
Jones definitely stand out. 
While most students may not 
know them personally, many 
have noticed the twins at one 
point or another. or are at 
least awue of their existence. 
The main reason that the 

girls are so well-known on campus is that they are physically 
indistinguishable and always together. 

Walking into their room is like walking into a room of mir-
rors. Their beds are made exactly the same way. each with an 
identical leopard-print comforter fulded over at the same cor-
ner at the exact same angle. On the wall above each bed, there 
are two matching portraits of a young girl. In both portraits. 
the girl is wearing the same outfit, smiling with the same degree 
of eontenonent. and posed exactly the same way. While the 
portraits seem to be copies of one another. they are actually pic-
tures of two different girls: Shemia and Sheme're. 

Since birth. Shemia (Shah-MEE-ah) and Sheme're (Shah-
MEER) have shared everything from dothing to secrets, 
friends to interests. Today. they are both Thurgood Marshall 
College sophomores at UCSD and are both psychology majors. 
They take all the same classes. have all the same friends and 
both have the same job. The most noticeable aspect about the 
twins, however. is the way they dress. Every day. the girls wear 
perfectly matching outfits, including their pants, shirts and hair 
accessories. For those who do not know them well, Shemia and 
Sheme're are impossible to tell apart. 

The twins claim that their mother began dressing them alike 
when they were babies, and once they became old enough to 
dress themselves. it only seemed natural to continue dressing in 
the same way. They admitted that it is difficult and uncomfort-
able fur them to dress differently from one another. 

"I feel weird when we're not dressed alike," Shemia said. 
Due to the twins' resemblance, matching outfits and insepara-
bility, they attract a great deal of attention every day. and are 
possibly the most recognizable women on campus. Although 

1IIna MacMunio/Guonikln 
The Jones: Identical wins Shemia (left) and Sheme're (right) pose in 
identical dothing on either half of their identical~ organized room. 
they are fully aware of thei r popularity, they claim that they do 
not dress alike for the attention it brings. "We do it because we 
want to. It·s who we are," Sheme're said. 

Being physically identical. however. is only a small part of 
the twins' alikeness. They are also psychologically similar. shar-
ing the same passions. favorites, struggles and aspirations. 

Both love Whitney Houston. the color red and ice cream. 
They both dislike writing and struggle with the same concepts 
in mathematics. They both want to get married one day and 
have the same number of children of the same gendcr. They 
both hope to have a singing career in the future, or else go into 
psychology. . 

"Neither of us is going to be more successful than the other 
because we are going to do ail the same things." Shemia said. 

Listening to the twins talk is like listening to one person 
talking. Shemia will often make a statement that Sheme're 
will conclude by saying. uYou know what I'm saying?" They 
seem to have an internal connection that allows them to 

Ih. F~bIM"'1( F'-4r~." C".,tribwti.,S Writer 

understand each other in the 
same way one understands 
his or herself. T hey say that 
the best thing about being 
twins is that "it's like having 
a built-in best friend. 

UWe never experienced 
loneliness until we started 
working di fferent shi frs." 
Shemia said. 

While the women love 

THE LIFE 
OF SHEMIA 
& SHEME'RE 

JONES 
being twins, their similarities have caused some problems in 
their lives. For example, because both have the same taste in 
men. they are often attracted to the same guy. 

UGuys get really excited when we like them," Shemia said. 
"They're like. 'Wow! Twins!'" 

UBut then they calm down." Sheme're concluded with a 
laugh. as they have no intentions of fulfilling any man's twin 
fantasy. 

Still. the twins never let men get in the way of their rela-
tionship. If a particular guy happcns to prefer one twin over 
the other. she will not go on a date with him unless her sister 
has a date that night too. 

. "I'm not going to go out and just be like, 'See ya,' to my 
sister," Shemia said . Last quarter Shemia was sick and missed 
quite a bit of class. It was difficult for Sheme're to go to class 
without her because she was so worried and did not want her 
sister to fall behind. 

"I did her homework for her, and I don't do that!" 
Sheme're exclaimed. 

T he twins say that they argue rarely and grow closer and 
closer as they get o lder. And tlle fact that many twins sepa-
rate at some poi '.lt..in life is almost unfathomable to them. In 
the future. they plan to live very close to one another. possi-
bly in different houses on the same estate. While Shemia and 
Sheme're are not one person. they are too connected to be 
considered twO entirely different people. 

"I don't think we ever were individuals," Shemia said, 
"but we're not one person ." 

"We're just two people very much alike." the girls sa id 
in unison.

Tritons take hard hit from defending CCAA champs 
Men's basketball suffers losses to San Bernardino, Monterey Bay 

By JOE TEVELOWITZ 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's basketball 
team dropped back-to-back 
home games over the past week, 
falling 80-61 to defending 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association champion Cal State 
San Bernardino on Jan. 12, and 
coming up short in an 87-82 loss 
to Cal State Monterey Bay on 
Jan. 14. The losses at RIMAC 
Arena drop UCSD to 5-7 overall, 
and 2-4 in CCAA play. 

UCS D 'scored the first points 
of the game against the Coyotes, 
but never led after that. The 
Tritons closed to within seven 
points with just under three min-
utes left in the first half, but the 
Coyotes proved to be too much, 
pushing the lead to 13 at halftime 
and never looking back in the 
second half. 

San Bernardino guard Trennel 
Eddings led all scorers with 22 
points, going 6-for-8 from three-
point range. James Perkins and 
Brian Pruitt contributed 14 and 
10 points, re pectively. Antoine 
Parker helped distribute the ball 
by dishing out a game-high six 
as ists. 

The Triton got strong games 
from freshman guard Joey 
Toboni and Clint liard , who 
tied fo r the team lead with 12 
points apiece. 

Another rookie member of 
the team, junior transfer guard 
Odioh Odiyeh, added II points, 
three assists and three rebounds. 
loboni also led the team in 
rebounding with four boa rds in 

17 minutes off the bench. 
The Tritons shot over 50 per-

cent from the field and 63.6 per-
cent from long distance in the 
second half, compared to 33 .3 
percent and 20 percent in the 
first half. 

However, the Coyotes, who 
had good ball movement with 23 
assists to UCSD's 14, also heated 
up in the second half, shooting 
65.5 percent from the field and 
maintaining their lead. 

The Tritons played tough in 
the loss, narrowly forfeiting the 
rebounding battle, 30-27, but 
countering the effort with 22 
turnovers. 

The Tritons had another good 
second-half shooting perfor-
mance against Cal State 
Monterey Bay, but a cold first 
half was too much to overcome. 

The Otters, in their first year 
of CCAA play, improved to 7-5 
overall, and 4-1 in conference 
action, despite the Tritons having 
better free-throw, field -goal and 
three-point shooting percentages 
in the game. 

The Tritons struggled 
through the first half with a 25-
percent field-goal percentage on 
6-for-24 shooting, while turning 
the ball over 12 times. 

The Otters took advantage of 
the opportunities to take a 14-
point lead into halftime. T he sec-
ond half was more of the same, 
with Monterey Bay taking a 19-
point lead at 48-29 with under 15 
minutes left to play. 

The Tritons weren't ready to 
lose in thei r first match-up with 
the Otters, but were able to come 

Men's volleyball loses in 
straight sets to Matadors 

Tritons drop MPSF season 
opener at Northridge 

By MEL ENTEEN 
Staff Writer 

On the road for its fi rst 
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation 
match of the season, it was up to the 
UCSD men's volleyball team to step 
up its game and shut down Cal State 
Northridge. Instead, they lost on 
Jan. 14 in straight sets, 30-28, 30-
25,30-27. 

The Tritons kept every game 
close, but for their second match in 
a row, they lost 3 -0. In the first

game, UCSD showed many charac-
teristics of a strong team, beating 
the Matadors in the team-attack 
percentage stat, .410 to .333. But 
the momentary advantage did not 
carry through, as Northridge pulled 
off the narrow victory in game one. 

In game two, the Matador 
defense was far better, holding the 
Tritons to a .140 attack percentage. 
UCSD's defense improved as well, 
cutting its opponent's percentage to 
.256; however, Northridge pulled 
off its second victory and remained 
comfortably ahead, 2-0. 

With the momentum in their 
favor, the Matadors charged ahead 
with a victory in the third game, 
ending the match and improving 
their record to 3-2 overall, 1-1 in the 
MPSF. The win in the final game 
was due to the Matadors' match-
high .484 attack percentage, which 
overwhelmed the Tritons' percent-
age of .312. The loss drops the 
Tritons to 0-2 overall, 0-1 in league 
play. 

There were some bright spots 
for UCSD, as senior outside hitter 
Luke Honnette racked up 15 kills 
and a .303 attack percentage. 
Honnette has led the Tritons in kills 
and will need to maintain his success 
if the Tritons want to win a match 
this year. Junior outside hitter 
Brendan Bowe and freshman John 
Mark Wendler also stood out for 
UCSD with 10 kills and seven kills, 
respectively. Sophomore setter 
Brooks Dierdorff contributed 30

UCSD worked itself to within 
four points of leading twice in 
the next two minutes, but the 

Otters held off the charge and 
pushed the lead bade to 15 with 
just under two minutes to play.

down, exploding with 20 points

By lEW PRAKASH 

Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's basket-
ball team went 1-1 in California 
Collegiate ·Athletic Association 
action last week with a win over 
Cal State Monterey and a loss to 
Cal State San Bernardino. The 
Tritons are now 8-5 overall and 
4-2 in league. 

The Tritons beat Monterey 
Bay onJan. 14 at RIMAC Arena, 
90-46. The squad saw remark-
able performances by senior cap-
tains and centers Stacy 
Gallagher-Bolton, who managed 
6 points and 15 rebounds in the 
match, and Margaret Johnson, 
who posted 13 points, eight 
rebounds and six assists. 

Junior guard Andrea Herold 
and sophomore guard Leora 
Juster each earned 14 points, 
while sophomore forward 
Hillary Hansen and sophomore 
guard IGm Buffum posted nine 
rebounds and nine field goals 
apiece. 

The Tritons held a strong 
lead of 42-29 over the Otters at 
the half, and managed to main-
tain it throughout the match. 
UCSD proved stronger as a 
whole in every facet of scoring in 
the match, averaging a .443 com-
pletion of field goal attempts 
compared to Monterey's .292 . 
The Tritons were stronger from 
long distance, managing to score 
.389 of all three-point attempts 
to the Otter's .273, who went 0-6 

in the second half. Lastly, the 
Tritons completed .591 of all 
free throws granted, while the 
Otters only completed .385. 

Earlier in the week, the 
Tritons were narrowly edged by 
the Cal State San Bernardino 
Coyotes on Jan. 12 at RIMAC 
Arena. Despite a tremendous sec-
ond-half effort from the Tritons, 
the Coyotes beat the Tritons, 63-
60. 

The Coyotes scored 20 points 
between the last five minutes of 
the first half and the first five 
minutes of the second half, while 
the Tritons scored none. 

The score was 49-31, with Cal 
State San Bernardino in the lead 
and 10:38 remaining on the c1oc~ 
when UCSD had a scoring run of 
its own, going 15-0 until they 
were only three points behind the 
Coyotes with 6:28 to go. 

The remainder of the game 
was an all-out brawl between the 
teams, both struggling to clinch 
the win. The Tritons led, 60-59, 
until the Coyotes' Sequoia 
Williams made a lay-up and 
Tamara Thomas got the follow-
up shot to steal the win with 0.6 
left on the clock. 

Despite the loss, the Tritons 
showed great effort on the field. 
Johnson posted 18 points and 
had nine rebounds in the match. 
Juster contributed 12 points of 
her own and had three assists.

academic 
reform 

12 

By CYNTHIA BLADE CHAVEZ 
.nd MATTHEW GRANT 

Senior Staff Writers 

The NCAA Division I Board of 
Directors approved an initial step 
to reform and improve academic 
standards regarding collegiate stu-
dent-athletes on Jan. 10. 

Had the measure been imple-
mented in the 2004-05 academic 
year, about 30 percent of football 
teams at the Division I level would 
have forfeited scholarships instant-
ly, according to the Associated 
Press. 

The Division I Committee on 
Academic Performance will issue 
warnings prior to the conclusion of 
the 2004-05 academic year to col-
leges that do not meet the 
Academic Progress Rate, which is 
approximately a 50-percent gradu-
ation rate over a five year period 
for student-athletes. The APR is 
calculated by the number of ath-
letes who attain academic eligibili-
ty, satisfy the full-time student ta-
tus and graduate. 

All men 's and women's sports 
will be affected by the APR stan-
dards, and by the start of the 2005-
06 academic yea r, all teams must be 
in compliance. The e rules will 
affect over 5,000 teams at 325 
Division I chools. 

The most affected athletic pro-
gram wi ll be football , baseball and 
men's basketball , where incompli-
ance rates range from 20 to 30 per-
cent, according to CAA data. 

In an CAA report, only three 
of the eight teams in the 2004 Bowl 
Championship Series would have 
met the recently pas ed academic 
standard: Michigan, Virginia Tech 
and University of Southern 
California. 

"This action today is a critical 
step in our journey to establishing 
much stronger and significant aca-
demic standards for NCAA student 
athletes," stated Robert 
Hemenway, chair of the Board of 
Directors and Chancellor of the 
University of Kansas, in an NCAA 
press release. "The ultimate goal is 
for our student-athletes to stay on 
track academically and graduate." 

Teams that fail to meet APR 
standards will be issued a one-year 
suspension on scholarship benefits. 
If a student-athlete on scholarship 
who is academicaJiy ineligible 
drops out of school, the scholarship 
may not be transferred to a new 
student-athlete for a full year. 

In addition, there is a 10-per-
cent cap on the number of scholar-
ships a team loses when they fail to 
meet the APR. 

The Board of Directors is cur-
rently deciding on "historical 
penalties," which are determined 
by APR scores and the Graduation 
Success Rate (the number of schol-
arship student-athletes who gradu-
ate each year). 

After three consecutive years of 
falling below the NCAA academic 
standards, preseason and postsea-
son competition wiJJ be rescinded. 
A fourth consecutive year of dis-
obedience mandates Division I 
status revocation. Historical 
penalties will go into effect in 
2006. 

Because of its Division II 
standing, UCSD is not affected by 
this measure. Furthermore, 
UCSD is the only Division II 
institution that does not offer ath-
letic scholarships, choosing to 
financially prioritize academics 
over athletics.
