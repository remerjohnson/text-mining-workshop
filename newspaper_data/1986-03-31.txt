TOUGH TO DIGEST 

By EVA WONG, Contributing Editor 
&: TRISH BROWN, Staff Writer 

W HEN MARGE (not her real name), shops for a food binge, she usually buys about $50 worth of Pogens cookies, Mounds, Hershey 
bars, doughnuts , Twinkies, cheesecake, potato chips, 
applie pie, pound cake and pizza. Back home, by 
herself she greedily gobbles down her purchases. Then 
as soon as she finishes stuffing herself, she makes a 
dash for the bathroom and force herself to v mit The 
secretiveness, the enormous quantities of carbohydrates 
in the high caloried foods, the binge-purge panern, all 
typify the behavior of someone with an eating 
disorder. 

Eating dl orders like bulimia and anorexia nervosa 
affect an increa ing percentage of the population. "It's 
an epidemi ," says Barbara Rohm of the Rader 
Institute , an organization that tr ats bulimia and 
anorexia. Eating disorders most often affect young 
women , but the ages of the people treated for errati 
eating panerns range from pre-teen to cniors. 

Informatl n from the U . . Public Health Department 
states that one of five American women has an eating 
disorder, and though men are also affected , 95 percent 
of the victims of thi deadly elf-Induced di ease are 
women . 

It's hardl}' surprisi ng that eating di orders .Ire 

Bulimia and Anorexia 
An Escalating Problem 
affecting more people than ever today, in a society that 
emphaSizes food on the one hand and thinness on the 
other. As Karby Allington, dietician lor an eating 
disorders unit, points out, today almost everyone u es 
eating habits to iden[lfy them elves to some degree -
"from junk fo d 'junkies' to health food nuts." 

Alternately, he says, our conversation are 
dominated by talk of diets, aerobIC, JoggIng and 
jazzerci e. While mo t of us manage to keep our 
perspective about eating and exercise, both anorexia 
nervosa and bulimia commonly begin as moderate 
effort to lose weight, then escalate to a dangerous 
obsession with food and body image. 

College students eem pani ularIy prone to eating 
disorders. A cording to Susan Boe hart of the Eating 
Di orders Unit at Harbor View Medi al Center, 
"College is often the first time the per n can be 
indep ndent, and haracteri ticall)' the fir t year way 
from home women Iways gain weight in the 

dormitory. Weight can be.a real issue." 
Boeshan also believes that there is a lot of peer 

support for anorecticlbulimic behavior on college 
campuses. She says, "It's commonly accepted , and 
becoming more so; people get together and suppOrt 
each other. They go weeks without eating and have 
contests to see who can lose the mo t weight and who 
can tarve them elves the longe t without fainting m 
cla s. The e are intelligent college students that are 
doing stupid thmgs to their bodies." A Significant 
number of people die each year becau e of their 
abusive use of food . 

Victim of eating disorder are "playing Ru sian 
roulette with their bodle ," says Rohm. "We don't know 
how often a person an vomit and pra tice 'scarf and 
bcHf parties or 'bag and gag' partie before they die 
from the prac[l e." 

Recently a girl wa found dead in her apartment in 
. n Diego. Rohm ays the Deputy Coroner' office 

called the Rader Institute becau e a business card from 
that organization was found in the girl's pocket" he 
had never made the call," Rohm ays." he was found 
dead and the Coroner found eVldence of empty pizza 
b xes, cookie boxes, empty food cartons all over

Failure to register with the 
se lective service may result in a 
fine or imprisonment. 

Jerry Solomon, a New York 
State legislator proposed an act 
(the Solomon Amendment) that 
was eve ntually passed, 
prohibiting such institutions of 
higher education from allowing 
students who were not in 
compliance with the selective 
service act to be able to receive

'These monies were not to be 

made available by the respective 
instirutions to any student who 
objected to or who could not, in 
conscious, sign the document 
(statement of compliance): Ann 
Klein , Associate Director of 
Student Financial Services said. 
The UC Regents joined many 
other institutions in the nation 
to formally object in writing, to 
the passage of the Solomon 

Amendment . 
Once it passed . the 

instirutions then objected to the 
implementing of regulations that 
would involve the universiry in 
another phase called the 
verfication phase. However. the 
Regents never actually gOt 
involved in this phase . In 
addition 10 having to collect the 
statements of compliance with 
the selective service acts, the 
Regents were also supposed 10 
check documentation that 
proved that the student had 
been sent verification that he 
had regIstered for the draft. 

Coolidge stated , "We objected 
on principle because we did not 
believe that institutions should 
be doing this as a matter of 
public policy. and we also 
objected from a practical 
standpOint. The workload would 
abuse resources of the campuses 
which should be made available 
for other purposes - financial 
aid and not for this purpose." 

According to Klein the 
institutions were not successful 
in persuading the government to 
eliminate the law. But, were 
successful in avoiding the 
verification phase from coming 
10 the universiry. "Instead the 
Secretary of Education had the 
responsibiliry of com municating 
with the director of the selective 
service as to the appropriate 
distribution of federal money.

Guys, if you're within 30 days of 

turning 18, you have to register. Just 
go to the post office and fill out a card. 
It only takes five minutes. And don't 
wony, there hasn' t been a draft since 
1973. The country just needs your 
name in case there's ever a national

the names of the students are 
not reported to anyone . It is only 
if the student receives their . 
money that they can come look

Coolidge explained that a list

According to Klein . the only

Klien emphasized, ' We do not

that the student's right to privacy

Cornering an indigestible social malaise 
We continue to manifest our dangerous obsession with perfection. As 

a whole, our SOciety, through our industries, slyly encourages individual 
self-destruction for the sake of idyllic standards. Secial malaise manifests 
itself again in the form of the eating disorder. Anorexia and bulimia are 
diseases which, like alcoholism, physically and psychologically damage 
their victims. Both historical forces and contemporary trends have 
brought about the epidemiC emergence of these self-destructive and 
potentially life-threatening phenomena. Only by recognizing our 
received ideas about beauty and success can we overcome the 
destructive effects these diseases have on our lives. 

encouraged to figh t their natura l tendency to retain a higher percentage 
of body fat. For this reason, women manifest obsessions with food 
exercise and worse. The "binging and purging" which characterize 
bulimia and anorexia are a direct result of concerns with perf~ct body 
type. 

The elevation of the "twiggy" look is directly correlated to the 
narcissism and self-absorption that epi tomize the seventies and eighties. 
The growing threat of nuclear annihilation has combined with post-
Watergate cynicism to produce anxiety and fear because we cannot 
control our circumstances. So we have begun to shift our focus to what 
we can control: our bodies and our diets. Historically, inequality based on gender differentiation has been 

expressed by limiting women's access to mechanisms of political and 
social mobility. Higher education and most careers were open only to 
men; women's roles were primarily defined by the duties of wife and 
mother. Women were hobbled both by their lack of rights in the 
political and social structure and their objectification in marital and 
sexual relationships. The worth of a woman was directly related to what 
she could offer her husband . Emphasis on a woman's physical 
appearance originated in judging her according to her attractiveness to 
men . Although women had limited comrol over their lives, enhancing 
beauty afforded one method of control. 

The advertising media have emphasized appearances and images 
which demonstrate that a certain "look ," or, as the manufacturers of 
Jordache say, "the look that's right" is the key to both success and 
happiness; the means to achieve the look are insignificant when 
compared to the desired results , While fimess remains the ideal, the 
appearance of fitness really counts in achieving social acceptability. The 
discrepancy between impression and reality encourages anorexics and 
bulimics to ignore the dangerous consequences of their obsession. 

In spite of the achievements made by the women's movement, 
society's emphasis on the physical appearance of women has not 
diminished . The definition of beauty changes continually, but ideal 
standards of beauty still pervade our judgments. The ideal body type has 
fluctuated between the buxom and rounded Marilyn Monroe look to the 
thin and phYSically fit "hard body." With the change, women have been 

Although increased awareness of particular symptoms is a step in the 
right direction , sicknesses like eating disorders will continue as long as . 
society massively advocates respect for mere appea~nces through the 
media. As individuals living in a modem society, we are challenged to 
retain a value system independent of that perpetuated by advertiSing 
media. The ability to do so will enable us to escape the apparent 
problem of eating disorders and the invisible fears which these diseases 
express.

Another "good Jew" 

Editor: 
Has Greg MacCrone defined the 
''good Jew?" 

While we will concede that 
ignorance is not automatically to 
be construed as anti-Semitic , It IS 
still true that the latter category is 
closely associated with the 
former. Our brilliant 
undergraduate "leader" Mr. Greg 
MacCrone has this time (in hIS 
letter in the Marc h 6, 1986 issue 
of the UCSD Guardian) stuck his 
anti-Semitic foot far too deeply 
down his anti-Semitic mouth . To 
wit: 

His contention that one 
cannot be a Jew and also be 
opposed to the state of Israel 
without being a "hypOCrite" 
demonstrates his knowledge of 
the diversity of modem Jewish 
hfe : none . Or rather, hone other 
than popular stereotypes and 
mass media prejudices. 
MacCrone has offended all of the 
orthodox sects within Judaism 
which have never recognized the 
state of Israel (they do nor 
believe it is the "real" Israel). He 
has offended all anarchist Jews 
(most of whom are atheIsts) who 
don't support any state -
Jewish, Swedish, Palestinian, 
Californian, and especially 
MacCronian, He has ignored the 
Israeli jews who today rot 10 
Israeli prisons for talking to the 
PLO. He has ingored the Peace 
Now movement and other, mOle 
radical seCtors of Israeli society, 
and their efforts to arrive at 
Justice and peaceful co-existence 
with the Palestinians. He has 
ignored the large number of Jews 
who, as refugees from Europe, 
became residents of Palestine not 
by choice, but only after the 
UnIted States and the United 
Kingdom refused them asylum 
during the Hitler years. 

He has ignored the large 
number of Jews wh o became 
residents of Palestlne , not by 

choice, but as victims of Zionist 
terror tactics, or as victims of

who today prefer to live in the

himself ofT as the judge of the

Mr. MacCrone evades the

(twO Jews who happen to look a 
lot like the Euro-centric 
stereotype of what a Jew is 
supposed to look like with the 
(hated?) images of "America's 
Enemies": Arafat and Khadafy? 
The random probability of 
picking twO jews out the handful 
that are part of the total number 
of these media workers IS , well , 
remote, 

MacCrone also evades the

Constitutional fraud? 

Editor: 
An open letter to Joe Watson 

As the Chancellor's deSignee 
for undergraduate affairs, we are 
requesting that you quash the 
current con titutlon under which 

the Associated Students is 
operating. Furthermore, we 
request that you reorganize the 
AS constitution in effect until it 
was arbitrarily discarded by the 
AS Council in Winter 1985, as 
the official constitution 
governing the activities of the 
Associated Students of UCSD. 

In 1977 Chancellor McElroy 
discontinued the Student 
Cooperative Union as the 
student government, and 
appointed the Campus Elections 
board to hold a campus-wide 
election to determine a new 

model of student governance. 
The Election Board , in 
consultation with the Chancellor, 
sti pula ted a 25 percent voter 
turnout. Three proposed models 
of student governance: The 
Student Cooperative Union 
model, the Cabinet Assembly 
model and the Associated 
Students model, were placed on 
the ballot for a vote . follOwing 
the vote, Chancellor McElroy 
authorized the Associated 
Students model as the official 
form of student governance at 
UCSD. 

In 1981, several students 
offered amendments to the 
Associated Students constitution 
while other .,students proposed 
entirely different models. 
Therefore, in accordance with 
provision in the constitution, the 
AS Council voted to hold a 
Constitutional Convention for 
the purpose of proposing 
amendments or new 
constitutions. The Convention 
recessed after the first meeting 
and no date was set to 
reconvene .

Afghanistan revisited 
ByNlDHALGUESSOUM 

An article tided "The ills of the 
Afghani resistance" appeared in 
the opinions section of the 
March 13 issue of The Guardian. 
The author, Mr. Glenn Sacks, 
first described the cause of the 
fight that the Afghan Mujahedeen 
are carrying on against the Soviet 
forces , in the light of his 
"knowledge of the recent history 
of Afghanistan." 

We Muslims are used to this 
kind of deeply flawed anicle and 
the mcredible misconceptions 
many people have about Islam; 
neverthelesss, it saddens us to 
see a supposedly enlightened 
college student write such totally 
mistaken views on an issue such 
as Afghanistan , which, by now, 
should be better understood , 
having been quite extensively 
covered by the medIa . In this 
amcle, we Wlll try to point out 
the most serious errors in the 
afore-mentioned anicle and give 
a more accurate account of the 
Issues involved. 

The author labels the Afghan 
fighters "Khomemist Islamic 

fundamen~ljsts ," Although the 
rebels have no hnk With 
Khomeiny himself or his 

government, (in fact , the Iranian 
authorities closed their borders 
[0 the fighters and refused to 
allow them to operate from their 
territories,) it is nO{ difficult [0 
understand why the writer 
labeled them as such. He 
capitalizes on the very bad image 
the Iranian leader has in this 
country to try to project a dark 
shadow on the Afghan fighters 
so he can be believed when he 
draws outrageous conclusions 
later on, Moreover, the word 
"fundamentalist" has co me to 
mean "socially reactionary," 
which, besides being a totally 
false image, as we will ,try to 
show later, attempts to conceal 
the whole ideological picture 
presented by Islam . 

The writer further obscures the 
facts by claIming that the 
Afghani revolt against the 
communists was triggered by 
"the Afghan Communists 
granting of equal rights to 
women." HIS comment either 
stems from total ignorance of the 
recent history and po\ttics of the 
Afghani revolutIon or from a 
disguised attempt to degrade the 
Islamic revolutIon and embellIsh 

the image of the inhumane and 
oppressive Soviet-Karmal regime. 

A bloody coup d'etat was 
engineered by the Soviets on 
April 27, 1978 which brought the 
Amin-Taraki-Kannal regime to 
power. After the wave of mass 
arrests, group liqUidations, 
terrorization and massacres of 
civilians that followed , the 
Afghan people revolted and 
seemed to be in a position to 
ovenhrow the government of 
Hafizullah Amin , which , in the 
meantime, had been recognized 
by Moscow. To save the 
communist regime from collapse, 
the SOviets invaded Afghanistan 
on December 27, 1978. It is clear 
that communism in that country 
did not arise from the 
proletarian masses, but was 
imposed on a people whose 
history, culture and religIOn had 
nothing in common with 
communism. 

The political principle upon 
which the Islamic political 
ystem is based is called "shura," 

which is usually translateu as 
"democratic chOIce" This IS the 
way Cahfes (governors) were

much as the cartoon presents an 
offensive stereotype of the Arab, 
and nOl just of two Arab leaders, 
it insults all Arabs. Canoons of 
world figures are often 
degrading, however. this is not 
what is objectionable. But when 
degrading portrayals promote 
racism, anti-Semitism (and , 
generally, oppressor ideology) all 
sane people protest. An injUry to 
one, IS an injury to all . The U.S. 
government recently released a 
report that there were more cases 
of violent assault against 
individuals of Arab ancestry than 
any other ethnic group in the 

country last year. Jews 
understand that mass hatred and 
viole nce against one group can 
easily be red irected against other 
groups. The rise of violence and 
prejudice against Arab Americans 
is alarming, Jews are not the only 
Semitic people in the world. 
Arabs and Ethiopians are also 
Semitic. And -while European 
anti-Semitism against Jews has 
taken a different character 
historically, anti-Semitic 
prejudices against Arabs also 
have a long history in Europe 
and wherever Europeans have 
invaded and settled (eg. North 
America).

.do Mr, MacCrone and Mr. 
Fahlbusch think the response 
would be if they were to post a 
canoon showing a racist image 
of Black African "savages," say, 
boiling "sai ntly, civilized" white 
missionaries for dinner; and , let's 
say, the name of prominent

names of A.S. Council members 
over the missionaries?

finally , MacCrone's use 01 the 
loaded tenn "zeal" is 
reprehensible. Its negative 
connotation can be traced to the 
ancient jewish political 
movement called the Zealots. The 
Zealots led one of history's 
earliest recorded national 
liberation revolutions against 
foreign domination . Of course, 
the Roman Empire took a rather 
dim view of this. From Rome,

Afghan 
Continued from page 4 
chosen in the first era of Islam. A 
whole chapter of the Qur'an (the 
Islamic holy book) is titled "the 
shura." 

The economic system of Islam 
is based on a better sharing of 
wealth , with total respe t to 
illdividual ownership and free 
marketing (with small variations 
unimportant in thi s context) 
through the Zakat system. A 
simplified picture of the Islamic 
economic system would put it 
close to the modem european 
socio-democratic systems of 
France, GelTIlany or Sweden. 

We now come [0 the question 
of the status of women in Islam. 
a point which was so heavily 
attacked by Mr. Sacks. In Islam, 
women are not legal propenies 
of their husbands. In fact, Islam 
immediatley forbade the killing 
of female babies, a practice that 
was widespread in pre-Islamic 
Arabian culture . Then Islam 
ordered Muslims to educate thelr 
sOns and daughters (Prophet 
Muhammad said · "Knowledge is 
an obligation fo r every muslim 
man and woman.) Many muslim 
women became scholars on 
religious maners (one of whom 
was the Prophet'S wife, Aicha) 
and received men and women in 
their homes to teach them and 
answer their questions . Islam 
gave the right of inheritance to 
women, for the first nme In the 
history of humanity. The 
Prophet, in his fi nal speech 10 
the emerging Muslim nation , 
kept emphasizing the questi on of 
the good treatrnenr of women, 
calling it a highly important 
religious duty towards God. 

As for the question of the veil 
and its relation to the rate of 
tuberculosis among the Afghan 
women, let us just state for Mr. 
Sacks' knowledge, that Islam does 
not order a muslim woman to 
cover her face. It requires her lO 
cover her hair and most of the 
rest of her body to prevent her 
from being used as a multi-
purpose sexual object and tool. 
The claim that "the veil 
prevented the Afghan women 
from intaking clean air," is 
unfounded. 

Regarding the question of the 
political status of women in 
Islam, we finally note that Islam 
is the ideology that gave 
unprecedented rights 10 women 
by explicitly allowing them 10 
obtam education, inherit and 
independently own propeny, 
choose their own marriage 
panners, obtain divorce and file 
action against their husbands for 
physical abuse . 

To wrap up this subject, let us 
just add that one cannot possibly 
imagine a people revolting and 
sacrificing 1.5 million fighters 
simply because the women have 
"just" been given equal rights. 
The cause of the Mujahedeen's 
revolt was clearly the communist 
ideology. Even if one accepts Mr. 
Sacks' oversimplified picture of 
Afghanistan as not being a 
nation , but only "a collection of 
tribes," it cenainly does not give 
the Soviets any right 10 send 
125,000 soldiers 10 impose 
government in that country. 

It is true th at the Afghan i 
resistance has different groups 
with different leaders and a non-
unified military command . but 10 
claim that "the tribes spent a 
good deal of their time not 
fighnng the Russians but fighting 
each other," tS a gross lie and we 
challenge Mr. acks 10 produce 
eVldence for it.

Continued from page 4 

In fall 1984. some students 
including then-President Marc 
Boroditsky and Vice Presidenr 
Mary Rose Alexander sought 10 
ins titute a new model of student 
govemance. In Winter 1985, a 
new constitution - outlining the 
functions and operations of an 
entirely new model - was 
approved by the AS Council 10 
be placed on a ballot. No 
Constitutional Convention was 
convened nor were other 
constitutions. including the 
constitutions in effect at the 

time . placed on the ballot. 
Following the vote , the AS 
Council adopted the new 
constitution as that goveming its 
operations. 

Based on this background, 
and strong legal and campus 
precedents were are asking that 
you declare the current AS 
constitution nuU and void. Our 
request is based on the follOwing: 
1. In failing 10 hold a 
constitutional convention the AS 
Council violated Anicle VII of its 
constitution. 

Aniele VII clearly specifies the 
method to be followed to 
propose new constitutions: a 
constitutional convention must be 
held. The AS Council , however. 
chose to completely ignore these 
provisions, ostensibly to serve its 

own political needs. Moreover, 
Ihe blatant actions of the 
Council , having gone unchecked 
for so long, have cast serious 
doubt on the credibility of those 
administration officials who work 
closely with the AS and are 
charged with overseeing its 
functions and operations. 

As you well know, upon 
approval in 1977 by ChanceUor 
McElroy, the AS constitution 
became pan of University 
policies and procedures. In 1977 
the AS model was hailed by the 
UCSD administration as "a time-
tested model recognized by the 
UniverSity systemwide and 
Regents as a legitimate and 
accountable. form of student 
representation ." Why eight years 
later the University has 

apparently turned a blind eye to 
such massive violations of 
University policies is 
incomprehensible to most 
reasonable people and is 
tantamount 10 political 
pandering. 
2. The vOler turnout of 
approximately 650 students in 
the Wimer 1985 ratification vote 
represents less than 6 percent of 
the IOtal students eligible and it 
is reasonable 10 assume the 
results, therefore cannOt be 
recognized as conclusive.

ontinued from page 6 

Afghani war. We do not 
understand how one can 
describe the use of Napalm, 
chemical warfare , systematic 
eradication of entire villages and 

agricultural harvests to dimmish 
people's support to the fighters . 
We cannot understand how one 
can de ribe this as "minimal 
use of Soviet militaty power." It 
seems one needs maximal use of 
militaty power to kill 1.5 million 
people , and drive 3.5 to 4.5 
million people out of their 
homes and into refugee camps 
In only 6 years. 

As for the claim that the 
standard of living in Muslim 

provinces of 0 iet Central Asia 
is "the highest in aU the Muslim 
world," we really do not know 
whether this is to be taken 
seriously. The Muslim prople of 
the oviet provinces are among 
the poorest and most oppressed 
peoples of the world . Their 
mosques and religious hools 
have been systematically 
destroyed or transformed into 
administrative offices since the 
communist revolution . 

In order for a Muslim to hold 
any administrative office and 
raise his standard of living, he 
must nO! only join the 
Communist Party (thereby 
rejecting his Islamic ideology) 
but often change his "Islamic" 
name. (Umar becomes Umarov, 
etc.) Mr. Sacks still dares to talk 
about "advantages of the leftist 
regime: and about "personal and 
political freedom ." If there is one 
effect of the Soviet invasion that 

can be considered positive ~ r 
the Afghan people, it is a 
massive realization of their 
Islamic Identity, culture and 
sociology, which implies total 
rejection of communism as a 
socio-poli tico-economic ideology. 

In conclusion, we invite Mr. 
Sacks to seriously reconsider his 
"knowledge" of Islam and 
Afghanistan. We hope that in the 
future, he will not insult us with 
similar articles and opinions. ~

Digesting eating disorders

glass of some sort of emetic, a 
substance that induces vomiting. 
Traces of the acid in the vomit 
was all over the apartment. She 
died , She was twenty-two, 

On the UCSD campus, there is 
a program with three separate 
self-help sub-groups for students 
with eating disorders. Recovering 
from Eating Disorders/ Group 
(RED I) deals with overcoming 
binging and purging behaviors 
such as laxative abuse and 
vomiting on a regular basiS; RED 
n, helps students in the process 
of giving up serious eating 
problems and fOCUSing on other 
areas of life during the 
transitional period of recovery; 
and RED III is designed to 
manage compulsive eating 
patterns through the building of 
effective coping styles. 

According to Dr. Bev Hal)u, a 
counseling psycholOgist at UCSD, 
the groups are led by a 
psychologist on staff or an 
intern, with a co-leader from the 
peer counselor group; peers have 
co-led groups for the past three 

Some 
of 

years. Harju says, "Some of the 
things that help people are 
belonging to a group of people 
wh o have the same problem, and 
making the commitment to be 
helped and to give help to other 
people." 

Ha~u says, "For example, for 
people who are engaged In 
bulimia behaviors, such as 
binging and purging - our first 
goal is to reduce the purging 
behavior, and then the binging 
behavior. To do that requires a 
person to struggle with the 
question of whether they would 
be willing to gain five or ten 
pounds while they make a 
transition to a healthier lifesryle. 
People have to realize that 
binging an d purging isn't a good 
way to diet. They also have to 
trust the way thei r bodies look 
isn't the main purpose of their 
lives." 

According to Boeshalt, purging 
the body of several thousand 
calories consumed in a binge of 
usuany high-caloric foods, 
doesn't necessarily have to be 
throwing up or through the use 
of laxatives and diuretics, "It can

Leslie (not her real name). 
wh o was treated in the Inpatient 
program at Harbor View and 
wh o now is in the Outpatient 
program says. "[ was into body-
building and I would just keep 
goi ng. [ would work out maybe 
three hours a day, pumping iron 
and stuff. I could feel my heart 
(being overworked), but I just 
kept going." 

Leslie says of her abuse of 
food , alcohol and drugs stemmed 
from being taught at a young age 
to not show her emotions. "I'm 
also a recovering alcoholic and 
drug addict, so th is therapy kind 
of goes along with my other 
programs that I'm working on. [ 
hated myself so much, that I 
wanted to hurt myself that much. 
Bulimia was a way of releasing 
something, without having fears 
and emotions - [ had a way of 
conrrolling something." 

The contributing factors of 
food abuse are a need to be 
perfect and a need to control; it 
is a physical and psychological

disease, according to Rohm. 
The therapy that Leslie sought 

at Harbor View parallels th~ 
program at the Rader Institute; 
the RED groups orgamzed at 
UCSD also have similar aspects 
of both programs . but on a much 
smaller scale since RE D operates 
on a li mited budget and does 
not charge for its services. The 
.cost of the stay at both Rader 
Ins titute and at Hamor View 
averages a~ut $400 per d ay for 
a four to six week Inpatient care 
and aftercare as an Outpatient. 
According to Boeshan and 
Rohm , insurance usually covers 
most, if not aU of the costs. 

"Inpatient trearment is mosdy 
an intensive intetvention," says 
Boeshart, "The real recovery is 
beyond that, in the after-care." 

Rohm agrees. "When they 
leave Inpatient (care), as far as 
I'm concerned, recovery JUSt 
begins, We've given them the 
tools and aUowed them to see 
how to use the tools. Now it's up 
to them to use them: 

The Rader Institute has an 
intensive Inpatient program in 
which they treat the problem 
"from a multi-diSCiplinary 
approac h ," says Rohm, 
expla ining that means they treat 
it from physical, emotional, 
psychological and spiritual 

standpOints. 
Hamor View's Inpatient 

program examines food 
behaviors , provides nutritional 
education and has an 
observation period after each 
meal. There are alsO classes in 
dealing with stress, peer 
relationships, asse rtiveness. and 
handling anger. An important 
aspect of both programs is the 
group therapy, which continues 
even after the hospitalization 
period is over. 

Some treatments for cating 
d isorders seem standard , like the 
use of group therapy, but the 
program at HaIbor View also 
includes art therapy, used to 
exemplify the patients' distorted 
body images. 

Boeshart says the alt therapy 
also helps to identify feelings. "If 
a person is in a lot of pain, it's 
real hard to talk about their 
feelings; that's why the food is 
the focus because it's so much 
easier to deal with ." So she says 
much of the work is helping th~ 
person to express feelings 
comfoltably. Art therapy turns 
out to be a safer way to ventilate 
those feelings. 

One patient drew a memorable 
picture of a volcano, "You could 
just look at it and feel the anger 
and frustra tion th at was just 
boiling undemeath , waiting to 
come out ," Boeshart says.

beach, She's above thal. Yet, 
orne times the sc hizophrenia 

sets in 
So much of coltege life is 

dating. The mentality is, who 
cares if she's intellectual ; is she 
blonde and ski nny? Like Elle 
MacP herson on the cover of 
Sports llI ustrated: Isn't she having 
fun ? She doesn 't worry about 
grades, Anyway, who cares if 
she's read Dostoevsky? Maybe 
her time would be bener spent 
working on her tan or 
memorizing some cute jokes, 

The girl in Ralphs seems 
rather caught up in it, otherwise, 
why the Glamour magazine? And 
the Tab? Does she want (0 look 
like the curvaceous girl in the 
Tab commercial? 

"Men seldom make passes at 
girls who wear glasses." Maybe 
it's still true. That makes colege 
life difficult. When Bene Davis 
lets her hair down and takes off 
her glasses in The New Voyager, 
she is desirable - she couldn't 
be intellectual and desirable at 
the same time. 

But th is girl wantS (0 get her

her own two feet in the complex 
world she lives in, Her 
philosophy probably goes 
something like , "You've got to be 
the right person, the whole 
person, before you expect to find 
the right person ." So she's trying 
to create something that she's 
proud of, with her career and 
direction. 

In the process, she maybe is 
defeating herself. if he's looking 
for that thin blonde on the 
beach. She wouldn't want a man 
who values that kind of thing 
anyway. That's the dichotomy. 
She wants both . 

Like the sylph in the 
international coffee commercial 
who works all day as an 
executive, and, no doubt, comes 
home and changes fro m her chic 
suit to a chic T-shirt and 
beautifully sips a 30 calorie

preoccupation with food and 
solitary binging, which often 
keeps someone from going out, 
is the homework assigned by the 
RED groups, Homework might 
cons ist of goi ng to a palty and 
seeing if they can manage to stay 
for a while. 

Harju says eating problems 
start with low self-esteem with 
people "feeling they've go~ to do 
something so that they're 
beautiful enough to go out of the 
door." But, she says, "they never 
get out the door, because they 
spend most of their time gening 
ready to go out the door." The 
RED groups work on making the 
student aware of their own 
strengths showing them "they are 
good enough to go out the door, 
and were always good enough." 

Halju says, "Most students 
who Sign-up for the groups stick 
with it throughout the sc hool 
year. We ask them to make th e 
commitment of attending 
regularly once they've joined, and 
by doi ng some outside work on 
their own will help change the 
habit." Hadu believes the sU' ess

studying, so what better thing is 
there to do than go for late night 
munchie runs?" 

She said she gained 20 
pounds wh en she moved in the 
dorms . "You've got your meal 
card , you've gona use it, who 
wants salads? And their 
vegetables aren't that greal," she 
says. 

Hueber says she's losing 
weight now, it's called the 16 
units, work 15 hours, and no-
time-for-Iunch diel. 

Megan says she gOt "fat and 
white" since going to college. She 
doesn't live on campus, but "It's 
all the srudying. [ study alone a 
lot." She says school is difficult, 
and she used to be more 
"outdoorsy." "[ don 't really care 
about food that much, I mean, I 
hate thinking about dieting. It 
seems tOO trivial, but then I don't 
even fit in my jeans, I like to 
snack while I'm studying, and 
dinner breaks are like rewards if 
I've finished a chapter, or 
something," she says, 

Typically, college girls are on a 
"yo-yo system" of dieting, 
according to Dr. Barbara Czescik, 
Ph.D., the leader of weight 
control workshops at UCSD. She 
counsels students through 
behavior modifications. Many 
students tend to skip breakfast, 
and go through classes until they 
are starving, Then they grab 
what's available . Munching on 
the run is a product of the 
rushed lifestyle. 

Srudents often rely on the "If I 
take five classes straight, do the 
laundry and then go to the 
library, then I'll have ten minutes 
left for lunch on Tuesdays and 
Thursdays" type diet. And given 
the average college student'S 
budget, what is available in ten 
minutes is a health bar-type 
snack for the co-op or a burger 
from the pub. 

At first glance, the meal bar or 
bag of carob raisins looks good . 
It's inexpensive, ranges from 4O¢ 
to $1.50, and the college student 
could eat a week's worth of 
lunches for under $5 ,00. Bars are 
easy because they take one or 
two mi nutes to eat, and save 
time for studyi ng. In fact, if 
you're reading or walking to 
class, you may not even notice 
that you just ate one. Also, theX 
usually contain carob, honey or 
peanuts, which means 
"health ." 1m 
70 percent. 

The RED groups do not treat 
anoreK:a, because anorectics 
produce a paradox; if. the 
behavior is working for them, 
they don't want to be treated. 
Accord ing to Ha~u, "Real 
anorectics end up being 
anorectic until they have to be 
hospitalized," 

Sometimes the distinction 
between anorexia and bulimia 
blurs. Rohm, herself a recovering 
anorectic and bulimic, says, "1 
believe that anorexia is no longer 
a separate and distinct disorder. 
It's palt of a continuum. [ went 
back and forth along that 
spectrum from anorexia to 
bulimia for 29 years," 

Rohm think most anorectics 
will become bulimic, provided 
they neither die nor seek 
trearment, "I belleve it's a maner 
of time," she says, "because you 
cannot compulsively starve 
yourself before you compulsively 
go over to that next continuum 
- the next extreme, which is to 
(either) gorge or die ," 

Bulimi s, who bi nge and purge 
compulsively, often have a 
history of other impulsive 
behaviOrs , such as alcohol or 
drug use, according to an article 
in the New England Jo urnal of 
Medicirl'. They spend large um

Continued from page 17 
buy food for their binges. Like 
drug addicts, they may resort to 
stealing money or shoplifti ng 
food to support their habit. 

The New England Journal .oj 
Medicine suggests that eating 
disorders may develor partly as 
a result of the cultura value 
placed on thinness in Western 
society. It cites a 1.980 study of 
PlaybC}' centerfolds and Miss 
America winners over the past 
25 years, which found that their 
bust and hip measurements, as 
well as their weights, have 
progressively decreased. 

Some experts think abnormal 
eating patterns may result when 
women define themselves in 
terms of how they think they are 
perceived by men. Boeshart 
points out that women are given 

th e message lhat they aren 't okay 
as they are : they need makeup 
and the right kind of clothes and 
the right hairstyle to make them 
okay. And . of course. women get 
the message that they need to be 
thinner. It 's JUSt not clear who's 
sending the message - women 
to themselves or men to women . 

Although most anorectics and 
bulimics are women , men are not

Rohm adds, "Eating disorders

No longer is it a female disease , 
the black and white outlines no

with eating disorders are high

Eating disorders cut across all

According to Rohm , there are 

twO general feel ings a patient 
feels after being identified as 
having an eating disorder, one is 
of relief, si nce the behavior no 
longer has to be a secret, and the 
Other feeling is of absolute stark 
terror, because somebody is 
going to take away something 
familiar. 

Rohm says, "Normally within 
two weeks of treatment, you 
notice a change in the eyes; the 
eyes become clear. Because 
they're not using food as a drug 
and they're not vomiting; they're 
getting the proper nourishment, 
the eyes are clear and bright. 
There 's somebody home behind 
those eyes; the eyes are no 
longer glassy." 

Room believes recovery just 
begins as a patient leaves the 
Inpatient program and goes out 
in his or her own, "They're 
starting to clean house, and 
they're starting to find out it's an

inside job and that it has 
nothing to do with food . We 
have to break the disfunctional 
pattern of eating first, before they 
can find out who they are, and it 
is a gradual process of finding 
out who they are and how they 
gOt lost along the way." 

People with eating disorders 
must learn how to deal with food 
in everyday life. An alcoholic can 
abstain from alcohol , a drug 
addict can avoid drugs. But as a 
recovering bulimic or anorectic 
you still have to deal with food 
three times a day. Leslie, the 
recovering bulimic from Harbor 
View, says that's the hardest part 
for her. "I don 't know anybody 
who eats three meals a day," she 
says with a laugh, but she must 
do so as a part of her recovery 
program. If she doesn't, she says, 
she sets herself up for failure, for 
a binge. "This is something thatll 
just go on I guess. I don't know." 
She smiles. "rm working on it

Judo class 
Continued from page 25 
was then , and st ill IS, Buddhtsm 
involvillg a belief in 
reincarnation. It was believed 
th at the next life would always 
be a better one , especialy if one 
died with honor. Ths most 
honorable death for samurai was 
to die in combat. This ideology 
made the samurai great warriors 
and formidable enemies since 
they had no fear of death in 
battle believing that this was the 
way of the warrior; to die in 
combat and return an even 
greate r wa rrior. 

In times of peace the samurai 
often fought to the death in 
tournaments similar to those of 
the Roman Gladiators. This was 
the sport of the samurai , and 
gave them the opportunity to 
practice their fighting skills 
(primari ly sword fighting from 
which modem Kendo was 
derived) as well as giving them 
an opportunity to die honorably 
in combat. 

Each samurai was responSible 
for a given area of land, his 
ward , over which he ruled 
absolute, and more or less owned 
the peasants who tended the 
arable land of the ward . Samurai 
were basically very honorable 
warriors but did rule as tyrants, 
killi ng peasants as they pleased 
often without reason, and were 
never held respons ible. Again , 
the religion of the time 
accommodated diis since the 
peasants we re almost happy to 
give up their mi serable existence 
under the tyrant samurai 
believing they would return to a 
better life , maybe eve n as 
samurai. 

For centuries, life in Anc\ent 
Japan continued this way: 
samurai killing samurai , samurai 
killing peasants until gradually 
both samurai and peasants began 
to realize that being killed in 
sport or for little or no reason 
was becoming unacceptable. The 
samurai gradually stopped killing 
each other in sport but still 
reserved the right to kill their 
peasants as they pleased. The 
peasants were therefore forced to 
defend themselves. 

The peasants, not being 
warriors, were not permitted any 
weapons, thus had a problem 
defending th emse lves. They 
developed a series of unarmed 
fighting styles which involved 
primarily punching and kicking 
and varied from region to region . 
These styles of unarmed combat 
have since evolved into the 
various forms of karate. Korea, 
being a neighboring countty of 
Japan , was plundered by the 
samurai for centuries and some 
parts of Korea were, in fact. ruled 
by the samurai for some time. 
The Korean peasants, of course , 
faced th e same fate as the 
Japanese peaS<lnts and as a result 
the Korean karate styles (fo r 
example, Tae-Kwon-Do) 
emerged. The peasants also 
utilized certain farm impleme nts 
in thetr defense against 
murderous samurai . Nunchaka, 
for example , were derived from 
rice flails and were never used 
by S<lmurai. Samumi carried large 
swords and later guns as they 
became avai lable. 

Although to die in combat was 
still the most honorable death for 
samurai, their mutual laying in 
sport decreased . ivil wars anti 
rehellions were ammon in the 
tumultuous poli ti cal climate of 
the time, giving the samur,li 
,unplc upportun ltl c~ to die tn

and strength. From thi s wrestli ng 
spon, the modern sportS of 
Sumai Wrestling, JUJit su, and 
Judo have evolved judo is the 
most prom tnent of these, betng 
japan's national sport as we ll as 
an Olympic sport . Judo is, 
therefore, pnmarily a sport and 
is often refe rred to as "the way of 
the warrior" and "the way of the 
gentle road ." However, although 
judo is primarily a sport, the 
close co mbat inherent to Judo 
makes it especially useful in self-
defense. This class will offer judo 
as a sporr but the appliance of 
Judo to self-defense will be 
continually illustrated. 

I am a British Judo Association 
registered 1st Dan (Kodokan, 
Japan affiliated) and have been 
playing Judo for over five years. I 
have represented my country 

(Scotland ) tn Judo and I have
