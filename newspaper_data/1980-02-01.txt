Students and Faculty Say 
Thumbs Down to Draft 

By Dwight Samuel Gooch 
Auociate News Editor 

Optimistic applause and a verbal consensus for organized 
resistance to the currently proposed national military draft 
legislation marked UCSO's anti·draft meeting last night. 

Although most of the approximately 175 UCSO students, 
faculty and others in attendance responded favorably to 
fonnally organized resistance, most of the dicussion centered 
on specific means of avoiding registration and induction. 

"There are no student deferments as such in the current 
legislation," said Kathy Gilbert of the National Lawyer's 
guild. "Much of the regulations are vague, limited and 
esoteric." 

According to Gilbert, three main deferment categories are 
applicable to students: 4·F for medical , psychological and 
moral reasons; conscientious objectnr deferment; and

US Inflation: 'Key to 
Afghanistan Crisis' 

By Eric Jaye 
The US economic slump rather than Soviet imperialism is the 

key to the "Afghanistan crisis," speakers at last night's "teach in" 
in the Humanities Library said. 

While not excusing the Soviets for their invasion of 
Afghanistan, each of the four speakers drove home the point that 
the US government is using the so-called crisis to escalate the cold 
war, stifle political dissent at home and stimulate our sagging 
economy. 

The mass media is being used to divert attention from the true 
cause of the crisis, which UCSD communications professor 
Herbert Schiller called the unraveling of the US empire. 

The US economy is feeling the affects of turmoil overseas, and 
a cold war would get it moving again, Schiller told the crowd of 
280 jammed into the auditorium. 

"You're damn right the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan is an 
elixir for our economy," Schiller said in the reference to a recent 
headline in the financial pages of the New York Times. 

"We're in the middle of the most unbelievable media blitz," he 
said, and compared President Carter's recent state of the union 
address to Hitler's propaganda parades at Nuerenburg. 

The media isn't providing anything close to an accurate picture 
of the situation, according to Schiller. 

"On Meet the Press you're going to see a real pluralistic group, 
starting with Ronald Reagan in the center," he added. 

According to another panelist, UCSD graduate student Gregg 
Robinson, both the Soviet Union and the United States must be 
condemned for their actions. 

"Hardly nice people," Robinson called them, the Soviets must

Good Safety Record 
Prompts Easier DNA Study 

'Common Sense' Rules Now Enough 
By Peter Mortensen 

Science Editor 
The federal government's adoption of less 

stringent safety guidlines for "genetic 
engineering" last week was met with 
enthusiasm from recombinant DNA 
researchers here. 

"I am very pleased and I think the changes 
are long overdue," said John Holland, a UCSD 
research biologist who handles substances 
which fall under the new rules. Holland 
indicated that he and his colleagues were 
actively involved in the campaign to have the 
rules relaxed. 

Accordin,!, to William Gartland, director of 
the office of recombinant DNA activities at the 
National Institutes of Health, last Tuesday's 
ruling "calls for the relaxation, but not 
elimination, of the stringent guidelines which, 
since 1976, have governed the biological and 
physical containment of research material from 
investigators. " 

Gartland explained that the NIH would not 
require P· l experiments - research using the 
most basic and weak strains of bacteria - to 
be reported to their office as was required under 
the 1976 rules. 

Also under the previous rules, Gartland said 
investigators had to be separated from the 
material they were working with by 
sophisticated "air curtains" and other positions. 
In addition, only weak, strains of bact~ial 
organisms could be used in the transplantation 
of genetic material. 

Now, he explained, the guidelines call only 
for "common sense" rules such as keeping the 
lab door closed during experimentation, 
cleaning lab surfaces daily and no smoking, 
eating or drinking in experimentation areas. 

"1 think that the clean record of such 
experimentation during the past five years has 
proved all the fears that surround it were 
unfounded," said Holland. He did not see any 
hazard of toxic or biologically dangerous 
materials being produced should an accident 
occur in a DNA lab. 

Gartland supported this view, stating that 
"there have never been any accidents of any 

concern in a recombinant DNA situation. Of 
course there have been broken centrifuges and 
spills reported to me, but no toxic or 
pathogenically dangerous material ever 
resulted. 

"We have accumulated risk factor data 
during the last several years that clearly 
indicate to us that it is just about impouible to 
create anything pathogenically dangerous from 
the E. coli k·12 bacteria that is concerned 
here," Gartland added. 

E. coli is a human "gut" bacteria that is "u.ed 
in more than 80 percent of recombinant DNA 
reserach," said Gartland. In its various forma,

Laughter Cures With No Side Effects 
By Deil St. Claire Bacon 

Staff Writer 
Nonnan Cousins is a layman whose ideas on 

medical care command the respect of the most 
eminent physicians in the country, and he corrects 

~pIe who call him "doctor." 
Cousins, editor of Saturday Review for 35 years, 

began his unprecedented climb to prominence in 
medical circles after he overcame a rare disease that 
was supposed to leave him paralyzed. 

Cousins' cure: heavy doses of vitamin C, rest and 
Iau~ng. 

' I decided that some physicians don't really know 
enough to make a pronouncement of doom on a 
hmnan body," Cousins said. 

He elaborated on the treatment of his disease, 
saying he was given heavy doses of pain killers from 
asprin to codeine. 

"It got to the point where I c~dn't function 
without them. After I had one 01 my auistants at the 
&view look up the aide eHects of the pills, I found 
them almost as frightening as my disease," he said. 

"It led me to believe that painkillers can be a boon 
in alleviating auHering but it makes psychological 
cripples and chronic ailen out of millions of people, 
notwithstanding ~ serious side effects." • 

But with the help of comic books, humorous novels 
and Marx Brothers films, Cousins eventually found 
he could forget about his pain without the pills. 

And at Cousins request, he and his doctor changed 
his medication to heavy doses of vitamin C. 

Norm Cousins found his own cure for his 
rare c1i1eUe: Vitamin C, reaL •. and eomie 
books. 

"With the vitamin, laughter and a strong will to 
survive I overcame what no physician believed 
possible." 

Laughing has "marvelous" physiological effects," 
Cousins adds, "especially on the respiratory system. 
Laughing is an excellent fonn of aerobic excerise in 
the bed", he said. 

He feels doctors should put more emphasis on the 
body's healing power. 

"Studies have shown up to 90 percent of patients 
reaching out for medical help suffer from self.limiting 
disorders within the range of the body's own healing 
powers. 

"The most valuable physician to the patient and 
society knows how to distinguish effectively between 
the large number of patients who can get well without 
heroic intervention and those who can't," he said. 

Part 01 releasing the body's natural healing powers 
lies in being in a comfortable environment. Using his 
case as an example, Cousins said he eventually 
moved out of the hospital and into a hotel where he 
found the environment '1ess dehumanizing." 

"I became convinced that nothing a hospital could 
provide in the way of the technology is as helpful as 
human compauion. I was fortunate not only to have 
a supportive physician but one who was willing to 
listen . to ~y ideas about m! illneu and answer my 
questions. 

He believes "the best physician lies within 
ourselves."

challenge by providing us with 140,000 fast food 
places to choose from. This figure means that a 
lot of people (not me or you, of course) are eating 
fast food regularly and in huge quantities. 

According to a recent Gallup Poll , all of 
America is doing it, and doing it a lot more often 
than mOlt of us are willing to admit: 33 percent of 
adults eat out every day - and they're not doing 
it at Mr. A's . 

Other factors ha ve contributed to the

about the dangers lurking between the bun will 
take you a long way toward making the right

Fish, contrary to what might be expected, was 
found to have more fat and more calories than 
chicken, but less than the burgers, with the 
Burger King Whaler containing the most calories

grams) of all the fish dishes. All fish examined by 
Consumer Reports was allO lower in other 
important nutrients than the burgers. Of local

Chicken from Kentucky Fried was a bIt more

more sodium (728 mg. ). Both are nutritionally

NEWS BRIEFS 

ERA Supporters and Opponents 
Say Draft Issue Will Help Them 

Supporters of the Equal Rights Amendment believe that 
swelling debate over possible draft regi.tration for women wiD 
boost their cause. ERA opponents say no, the controversy wiD 
help them. . 

Pointing to the growing debate on registering women, anti-
ERA leader Phylli. Schlafly said Wednesday there would be no 
need for discu8llion if the ERA - which bans discrimination on 
the basis of sex - had been ratified. She believes it would make 
drafting women mandatory. 

" If we had ERA, it wouldn't make any difference what the 
American people wanted ," said Mrs. Schlafly, head of Stop-
ERA. She laid equality under the ERA "means drafting girls 
and putting them in military combat." 

Kathleen Currie of ERA America takes the opposite view: 
"Thi. whole que.tion on the draft has pointed out what we've 
said all along, that Congre .. already has the power to draft 
women; it hal nothing to do with ERA. Whether to draft women 
is a political decision, not a legal one." 

To become part of the Constitution, the ERA must be ratified 
by 38 states by June 30, 1982. It hal been approved by 35 
state •. five states have recinded their approval, but the validity 
of that action is in question. 

When President Carter called last week for renewal of draft 
regi.tration, he did not .ay whether women would be reqtJired to 
register. He i. expected to decide the matter by Feb. 9 . 
Meanwhile, debate on the issue has grown. 

In .tate. that have not endorsed the ERA, many 01 the 
amendment'. opponents and proponents are claiming the debate 
over drafting women reinforce. their position •. Yet there wu no 
clear indication that the draft woukl directly affect ERA'. 
ratification. 

- In Illinois, anti·ERA Rep. George Hudson, a Republican, 
noted that Congress now can decide whether to draft women, but 
"if ERA becomes part of our Constitution, I don't think there win 
be ~ny option." 

- florida National Organization lor Women Executive 
Director liz Handley said a call to draft women would "probably 
help" ERA passage because it would be awfully hard to deny 
women equal rights if we expect them 10 serve their country in 
time of war."

Pentathlon Won By 
Consistent Freshman 

By Scott AlliIOll 
Staff Writer 

Bruce Jenner would be proud of Peter Grant, the Muir 
freshman who outl8lted a tough field of veteran competitors 
and won UCSO's second annual Racquet Sports Pentathlon 
laat weekend. 

Grant ran up .orne impressive stats in tennis, racquetball, 
squash, badminton and table tennis: 27 victories, only 7 
losses and 420 accumulated points. 

Harvey K1yce finiahed second in the competition with 23 
wins, edging third place finisher Tun GiUigan's 22 wins. KJyce 
and Gilligan had 394 and 370 points, respectively. 

Consistency was Grant's key to winning. In the five events , 
he finished as low as fifth only once. He placed third in three 
events and grabbed first place in tennis, where he played 
flawlessly. 

"Winning tennis surprised me a little," said Grant, 
"because I lost to Harvey Klyce earlier in the year in the

Viewing Pro Golf Drives Home Incongruities 
By Cliff Bayuk 

Recently I had the divine 
priviledge and opportunity to 
partake in the gallery of the 
Andy WiUiams San Diego 
Open. Each year the 
Profeaaional Golfer's 
Association graces the 
community of La Jolla and its 
reknowned Torrey Pinea 
Municipal course, with 
dazzling bunker shots, 
tremendoua drives. and 
remarkably accurate putting. 

Being a golfer of about a 20 
handicap, I appreciated the 
excellence of theae professio. 
naIs. But from the pure 
apectator point of view, it had 
to rank as a humiliating 
experience. 

First, there's the price you 
pay to get in - $8. I've paid 
up to $14 for a concert ticket 
to see the WHO, but $8 to 

walk around the golf course, 
following your favorite PGA 
pro, who follows around a little 
white ball no bigger than his 
palm well, that 's 
humitiating.

As I stood at the 16th

talking about the ridiculous

whereupon he promptly 
showed me hi. camera. 

I asked him how he would 
dare bring it out from under hia 
jacket and focus on the 
approaching threesome. He 
then demon.trated a "trick of 
the trade." 

He placed the camera 
comfortably under hialeft arm, 
and, atill under the cover of his 
jacket, he squatted down with 
an avid interest in one of the 
golfer'a approach ahota. 
Smoothly, he croued hi. right

Football Without 
Huddles: 
Kamehameha's Rules 

By Tim Liotta 
Senior Staff Writer 

By February, sports fans have all but forgotten football and 
have turned their attention to basketball, hockey and even the 
upcoming baseball season. The Super Bowl has been won by 
the Steelers and the Pro Bowl has been won by the NFC. But 
at UCSD a strange brand of football has grabbed the spotlight 
in the intramural department. .. 

The name of the game is Hawaiian Football. Its tradlbons 
are as strong as ever and the game is played today much the 
same way it was played in the times of King Kamehameh~. In 
fact the Official Hawaiian Football Rules And Regulab~ns wer~ transcribed in the Hawaiian Language by King 
Kamehameha himself. 

Two Hawaiian translators are rumored to be currently 
employed by the 1M deparbnent in hopei of c1arifyin, any 
rule discrepancies . Both Scoaka Bernyaesmoka and ~ikael,e 
Hipawanaripya currently preside over the play of this year s 
Hawaiian football schedule. 

The game itself is as exciting aa its traditions ar~ deep. ~e 
game is a CQmbination of football and rugby, WIth a fran~c 
pace of play. Ther-; ar-; virtually no huddles. ~ch half IS 
twenty minutes runrung bme, so mo.t team. hurry In order to

10-yard end zones. Each team 
sends out seven players 
aligning themselves in 
countless offensive forma-
tions. There is unlimited 
forward passing so no player is 
ever idle. The action becomes 
fast and furious with a flurry of 
laterals, forward passes and 
handoffs coming in almost 
every play. 

But unlike football , there 
are . no referees . Hawaiian 
football is a "gentlemen's" 
game which is exemplified 
with the players themselves 
officiating the play. Could you 
see a n 1M football game run in 
this manner? All hell would 
break loose.

PlantaDlura is Around Town 
Soprano, Carol Plantamura, member of the 

UCSD Music Faculty, has planned an evening 
of "music of love and insurrection," Sunday, 
Feb. 10_ at 8 pm in Mandeville Recital Hall. !. 

"Lea ChanlOns Madecasses" passionate 
love lOngs by Maurice Ravd sets the tone for 
the entire program. The program will begin in 
the traditional manner with Plantamura singing 
two arias by Handel, and violini.t Genette 
FOiter performing "fJegy" for 1010 violin by 
Stravinsky. 

John Patrick Thomas written in 1973 for 
violincello and soprano_ "Sunrise," a relatively 
unknown work for soprano, violin and piano, 
by Charles (ves - an exquisitely phrased 
setting of one of his own poems - adds luster to 
the program. 

Goethe's famous Mignon will be presented in 
two ver.ions - one by Hugo WoH, written in 
the 19th Century lieder tradition, and one by 

In conclusion, Carol Plantamura will sing 
two works written for her, "Alone 2," by 
Roman Haubenstock-Ramati, and 
"Cansecuenza II" by Carlos A1aina. Both 
works involve mixed media and ask the 
performer to play various instruments while 
singing. A new work by flutist Bernhard 
Batschelet will a110 be featured on the program.

Pro Golf Tourney 
Continued from page 5 

The pro golfer il IUch a

di.turbed. Don't take hi. 
pictUR!, don't talk; if you mUlt, 
you .should whisper. Don't 
move, don't gesture, and 
above all, don't .neeze or

'I1le profes.ional game of 
golf is a peculiar facet of the 
world of .porta. PGA pro. 
aren't ranked by their ability to 
hit the 300 yd. drive, their 
adeptnes. at placing a good 
approach shot near the pin or 
even their smoothnes. and 
conaiatency in_ putting. 

To be a pro golfer in this 
.ociety i. to be relatively close 
to deism, at least while they're 
performing their skills. 

The off·course endorse -
ments, respect and honor 
bestowed upon such an 
individual befits national 
leaders. For this reason, the 
leader of a pro golf tourney is 
usually the most consistent, 
concentrated, and sometimes 
the most courageous - much 
the same attributes which 
make up the leaders of our 
society. A pro golf 
tournament, from any aspect, 
i. a truly humbling experience 
to watch. 

arrested for sneaking through 
a back door of Univerlity Hall. 

Security was so tight at that 
time UC civics professor 
Charle. Schwartz was bodily 
escorted out of the 
administration building and 
the protesters were arrested 
and booked for trespassing 
when the building closed at 
5:30 pm. 

Ye.terday, David Wilson, 
the executive assistant to 
Saxon, only called up three 
plain clothes UC Berkeley 
police officers. The police 
chief, decked out in a maroon 
Pierre Cardin tie, said, 
"Historically, this is a very 
peaceful group. At least it has 
been so far." 

The group spokesman, 29-
rear.old Steve Ladd, a former 
Berkeley student of public 
policy, who turned in his draft 
card in protest of the Vietnam 
War 10 years ago, and has 
worked for the War Resisters 

League for the pa.t six years', 
wasn't pha.ed in the Iealt. 

"We'l be here with more 
and more persi.tence until 
they tisten to us. We are going 
to broaden our base of support 
and step-up our protests," said 
Ladd. 

Barbara Haber, a 
psychology graduate student 
at the Wright Institute, a 
private school established in 
an old frat-house here, said the 
protestors planned to continue 
their actions until the 
university severs ties with the 
nuclear weapons lab. 

Begun three-and-a-half 
years ago, the UC Nuclear 
Weapons Lab Conversion 
Project has so far been 
unsuccessful in its attempt to 
persuade the university to 
abandon weapons research 
and switch to alternative 
research projects. 

A motion put forward by 
Gov. Brown to the Board of 

Regents last July to sever ties 
with the Livermore, CA and 
Las Alamo., NM laboratories 
was defeated with only one· 
third of the Regents voting in 
IUWOrt. 

The movement suffered 
another setback this week 
when the UC Berkeley 
Academic Senate voted 125-
104 against a motion 
proposing UC severence. 

In a cat-and-mouse 
dialogue, Wilson told the 
activists he did not object to 
their ideas, but the fact they 
were disrupting business, and 
suggested there was an 
element of futility to their 
protests. 

He recommended they 
make an appointment to 
discuss their concerns with 
President Saxon, "But it's very 
unlikely Saxon will see you," 
he added. For pro golf i. a game of 

nerves and 'pressure, the beat 
being judged by their 
accumulation of yearly 
winning.. Tom Watson won 
over $350,000 in 1979, ·so 
he'. the beat. 

Draft Registration Attacked 
Continued from page 4 

To quote the golden bear, 
.Jack Nicklaus, "golf i. 99% 
mentaL" Thi. i. an 
undi.putable observation. All 
of those pros I .aw were 
capable of making that really 
great .hot; but the guy who 
made the great shot the malt 
often, was the winner. 

Another peculiar aspect of 
Pro golf i. its .trong accent on 
individualill1'l. If a pro i.losing 
or winning a golf tournament, 
it'. no one'. fault but hi. own. 
Of coune there are outside

your community who is in a responsible position. As you go, 
keep a good record of anything that might be pertinent to your 
claim such as church affiliation or organizational records . 

If you plan to claim medical or psychological deferment, 
make sure you provide for full documentation. 

Q. What constitutes a non-citizen for purposes 01 
deferment? 

A. Our organization does not know just yet. This is a highly 
specialized matter and the proposed legislation is unclear. 

Q. Is there any difference in major programs of study as to 
who gets called first? 

A. There i. not IUPPOSed to be any di.crimination along 
these or any other lines, but unfortunately many of the victims 
of the last draft were from low socio-economic and minority 
groups. 

Q. What is the projected role of women who might be 
drahed? 

A. Because of the military'l lexist philosophy, they would 
probably tend to keep women in the roles that would free men 
for combat duty. 

Q. Does service in the Peace Corps exempt persons from 
the draft? 

A. There is nothing in the current regulations that would 
exempt anyone from being drafted because of service in the 
Peace Corps, Vista or any other private public volunteer 
organization. 

Q. What is the deferment status for gays? 
A. 4-F the last time I checked - but the important thing is 

that they believe you. You have to prove it. . 
Q. What about extradition from Canada? 
A. The ways things are right now, draft avoiders who take 

up Canadian residence would probably not be extradited. But 
it s very difficult to gain admission to Canada for that reason. 

"President Carter'l State-of the·Union message on draft 
registration poses a real threat to us (students)," said Kathy 
Gilbert, attomey for the National Lawyer's Guild. "At 
present, there is much we need to know but don't know about 
the nature of soon-to-be-enacted registration and draft laws," 
Ihe said.
