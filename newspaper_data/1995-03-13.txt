Find Top Quark. 
SANTA BARBARA - UC 
Santa Barbara physics 
Professor Claudio Campagnari 
was part of a research team 
which recently found evidence 
of the existence of top quarks, 
the building blocks of protons 
and neutrons. Campagnari 
worked with more than 400 
physicists from 35 institutions 
around the world as a member 
of the Collider Detector team 
at Fermilab, in Illinois, which 
has spent the last year 
confirming an initial quark 
discovery last April. Top 
quarks were one of the last 
missing components of the 
"standard model" of the atom.

Hat. Speech 
Rul. Overturned 
PALO ALTO - A Stanford 
University regulation against 
hate speech was overturned on 
Feb. 28 by Santa Clara County 
Superior Court Judge Peter 
Stone. Stone ruled that the 
code, enacted in 1990, is 
unconstitutional because it is 
based on the content of 
speech. The regulation 
prohibits harassment of 
students on the basis of 
gender, race, color, handicap, 
religion, sexual orientation or 
national and ethnic origin. The 
ruling stated shielding students 
from insults based on gender 
or race was unconstitutional.

became its own department, 
making UCSB the first major 
research university in the 
country with such a depart-
ment. The Asian-American 
Studies program, which was

UCSD Grad Schools Rank in Top 20 
SURVEY: Seven 
programs ranked near 
the top by U.S. News 
By Ivan Delventhal 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD graduate programs, in-
cluding psychology, political sci-
ence and biomedical engineering, 
are among the top 15 in the nation, 
according to the 1995 U.S,. News & 
World Report ranking of American 
Graduate Schools published today. 

In addition, UCSD's medical 
school ranked 14th among 125 re-

search-oriented institutions in the 
sixth-annual study. The Medical 
school ranked behind such schools 
as Harvard, Johns Hopkins and 
UCSF. 

The graduate school rankings are 
the result of a four-month survey 
conducted by U.S. News to deter-
mine the country's best graduate 
programs. 

U.S. News drew on a combina-
tion of factors - including student 
-selectivity, faculty resources, repu-
tation and research activity - to 
determine the overall rank it as-
signed to graduate programs. 

"UCSD has been known since it 
was founded as a strong research 
institution," said Leslie Franz, di-
rector of Health Science Communi-
cations. 

"Part of our purpose is to teach 
our students how to advance medi-
cine and to be innovators in their 
fields," Franz added. 

In the U.S. News study, liberal 
arts doctoral programs were ranked 
based solely on reputational ques-
tionnaires.

programs were asked to rate institu-

• 

If you need any proof the world is getting more complicated, take a look at "Library Walk." A proposed walkway to be built from Gilman Drive to the 
center of campus has turned from a walk in 
the park to a heated debate about everything 
from eucalyptus beetles to concrete to 
library hours. 

Throw in a physics professor arguing 
about tree health, administrators fabricating 
statistics and a wasp that eats beetle eggs, 
and yo~ have a quite a mess. 

As with any such muddle, the truth 
seems to be the first casualty. 
TIle ContuUnta 

Controversy over the $2.5 million 
Library Walk intensified last week as 

students and faculty 
opposed to the project 
collected signatures in an 
effort to force a post-
ponement of construc-
tion, slated to begin 
Wednesday. 

Construction, 
however, will begin as 
scheduled, according to 
Assistant Vice Chancel-
lor of Facilities Design 
and Construction 
(FD&C) Boone 
Hellmann. And student 

activists admit the chances of halting the 
project are small. 

In one comer we have Physics Professor 
Jorge Hirsch, the opposition student groups, 
including the California Public Interest 
Research Group (CALPIRG) and the 
Student Environmental Action Coalition 
(SEAC), and other concerned students.

MEETING: Student Association. 
will proceed with limited 
student-issue lobbying 
By Ben EI"n 
Senior Staff Writer 

Opposing the ban on student-funde<! lobbying 
imposed by the Smith v. Regents decision, the 
University of California Student Association 
(UCSA) announced at last weekend's UCSD meet-
ing that it will follow its own interpretation of the 
ruling, which allows for limited student-issue lob-
bying. 

At this month's UCSA Board of Directors meet-
ing, UCSA representatives from the nine UC cam-
puses and the Hastings School of Law met to 
discuss fee increases, affirmative action and espe-
cially the controversial Smith decision. 

Smith v. Regents, passed in 1993, prohibits 
using mandatory student fees to fund campus orga-
nizations deemed to be political, religious or ideo- . 
logical in nature. 

Guidelines put forth by the UC Office of the 
President (UCOP) to define ideological organiza-
tions include all groups which engage in the "lob-
bying of local, State, or Federal officials." 

According to UCSA representative Naomi Falk, 
this strays from the purpose of the Smith decision, 
which she claims does not ban all lobbying. "The 
opinion is very different than the interptetation of 
the opinion," she said. 

Director of UCSA Field Organizing Kimi Lee, 
said she agrees that UCOP misinterpreted the rul-
ing. "The Office of the President has created a very 
strict interpretation of the Smith v. Regents deci-
sion," she said. "[UCOP] made a lot of assumptiQns 
that weren't in the ruling. Why can't we lobby on 
things the Office of the President does?" 

UCSA has warned the UCOP that it will no 
longer abide by the initial interpretation. In a recent 
letter to UC President Jack Peltason, UCSA Chair 
Andre Quintero stated, "UCSA will continue to 
comply with the Smith decision itself, but will not 
be guided by the Guidelines as presently written, 
because the Guidelines go beyond Smith and pro-
hi bit legitimate lobbying activity." 

The UCOP was unavailable for comment. 
The Smith ruling was originally handed down 

after a group of Berkeley students protested the use 
of their mandatory fees for lobbying on politically 
volatile issues. Student organizations had lobbied

Cross-Cultural Center

tive participants in the overall cam-
pus culture." 

The Cross-Cultural Center, 
which sparked controversy and de-
bate last year, has entered into its 
final planning stages and is expected 
to open in April or May, according 
to steering committee chairman 

Velasquez added that an impor-
tant function of the center will be to 
connect students with off-campus 
community and cultural organiza-
tions. "Some of us see a problem 
with being isolated in La Jolla -

George Mariscal. 
The new center, 

w h i c h 
underrepresented 
campus groups 
fought for last year, 
will move into 
Building 510, near 
the High Bay phys-
ics building. The 
center ' s steering 
committee proposal 
will be given to 
Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson this week, 
according to 
Mariscal, a profes-
sor in the literature 
department. 

"Some of US _

particularly the 
underrepresented 
students, who don't 
have much connec-
tion with the 
Chicano commu-
nity or the Mrican-
American commu-
nity," he said. 

While not yet 
approved, the 
center's plans pro-
pose to service stu-
dents, faculty and 
staff, which 
Mariscal said is im-
portant because 
staff and faculty are 
often role models 
for students. Ac-
cording to Mariscal, 
faculty will be able 
to hold seminars and 
related courses at 
the center. 

Underrepresented 
groups on campus 
have pushed for a 
center for students 
of color for several 
years, but were un-
successful until the 
Cross-CulturaIO>a-
lition (Ccq held a 
rally in February of 
last year which 
prompted the ad- AmerIcan 
ministration to ap- community" 
point a task force to 
look into creating a 
cultural center. 

Staff Affirma-
tive Action Direc-
tor Delia 
Talamantez, who is 
a member of the 
steering committee, 
said that staff mem-
bers could take ad-

- PatrIck V.esqU8l vantage of the 
OASIS Summer center'sculturaland 

_ The CCC argued 
that certain ethnic groups and pro-
grams relevant to those groups are 
underrepresented at UCSD, creat-
inga "hostile" campus environment. 

"The focus of the center was to 
look at why UCSD has a perception 
of not being a very conducive place 
to students of color," said senior 
Poncho Guevara, a member of the 
CCc. Guevara said he hopes the 
center will make the campus more 
comfortable for underrepresented 
students_ 

" Instead of complaining about 
the crisis of underrepresentation and 
the lack of connection to the com-
munity, we want to be pro-active," 
he a~ded. 

According to OASIS Summer 
Bridge Director Patrick Velasquez, 
a CCC representative to the steering 
committee, the center witt sponsor 
programs which would bring groups 
together which might otherwise be 
sponsoring their own activities. He 
said the center's staff and resources 
could be used by underrepresented 
students to "help them become ac-

Bridge Director social events and 
staff development 

courses. " It brings a form of good 
relations to the campus, so [staff] 
can discuss issues that may be diffi-
cult anywhere else," Talamantez 
said. 

Velasquez said he does not know 
if the administration will support 
the involvement of staff and faculty 
in the center, an ambitious under-
taking which center directors from 
other campuses have warned could 
result in burn-out for the staff. 

However, Mariscal said he be-
lieves it will be approved because 
the administration accepted Ihe 
original task force's recommenda-
tion to include all three groups in the 
center's programs. 

Yvonne Reid-Hairston, from the 
Affirmative Action office, will be 
the interim director of the center 
when it opens. A national search for 
a director with extensive adminis-
trative experience and an under-
standing of cross cultural issues will 
probably begin next month, accord-
ing to Mariscal.

Professor Wins $200,000 Health Award 
Professor Roger Tsien of UCSO's departments of 

pharmacology and chemistry has been awarded the 
Artols-Baillet Latour Foundation Health Prize for 1995, 
winning approximately $200,000. 

Tslen, whose research has focused on understand-
ing information processing inside living cells, has 
been a member of the UCSD faculty since 1989. His 
work was praised by the Foundation for ' Profoundly 
facilitating the discovery of key intracellular events 
critical for the action of hormones, neurotransmit-
ters... and growth factors by introducing particularly 
elegant, original and widely applicable methods.· 

One area of Tsien's research involves the design 
and construction of molecular "spies· that are in-
serted into living cells to report on the status of the 
intemal biochemical machinery of cells at any given 
moment. Specially designed computerized micro-
scopes can then read and record the signals that 
these ·spy· molecules send back_ 

Tsien's research has allowed him to observe alter-
ations in cell biochemistry caused by disease. This 
method also enables a researcher to observe the 
effects of drugs that might be used for treatment.

its support of the Smith ruling, it 
believes it is important for lobbying 
to continue on issues which are 
strictl y student-related. 

The UCSA interpretation divides 
lobbying into two categories. While 
lobbying on general issues would 
remain prohibited, lobbying on stu-
dent issues such as fee hikes and 
financial-aid regulations would be 
permitted. 

"We need some breathing room," 
said Director of University Rela-

The UCSA proposal sets several 
guidelines for lobbying with stu -
dent funds, including keeping a log 
of lobbying activities and any posi-
tion taken on issues. 

Pursley said he is confident that 
the UCOP will be satisfied with its 
lobbying guidelines. "There 's 
grounds for optimism that we can 
get something positive done, and 
get it done fairly quickly," said 
Pursley. " [UCOP] does feel that stu-

Monday, March 13, 1995 The UCSD Guardian OPINION .5 

AN OPEN LE'I'IER TO THE REpUBLICAN PARTY 
Editor: 

It has come to our attention that 
part of the "Contract with America" 
calls for eliminating the subsidy for 
interest on student loans. Currently, 
interest on student loans does not ac-
crue until six months following the 
completion of school. Under your 
proposal, iJlterest would accumulate 
from the date of borrowing, which 
would increase monthly loan pay-
ments for both undergraduate and 
graduate students. For graduate stu-
dents, due to the longer length of our 
studies, this would result in a net in-
crease in monthly payments follow-
ing graduation of approximately 50 
percent. As the representatives of 
over 3,000 graduate students at 
UCSD, we wish to indicate the 
Graduate Student Association's 
(GSA) unanimous opposition to this 
proposal. 

Our university 's combination of 
professional and academic programs 
has made a major contribution to this 
country, in both applied and basic re-
search. Each year, the UCSD School 
of Medicine graduates approxi-
mately 100 MDs who are able to ser-
vice our country's growing health-
care needs. Our university also 
houses the School of International 
Relations and Pacific Studies, which 
acts as a training ground in the fields 
of international business and inter-
national policy studies with a con-
centration on Latin America and 
Asia. In addition, UCSD houses the 
Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies, 
one of the most important research 
centers on Mexican and cross-bor-
dcr issues in the country. 

The universi ty has a host of aca-

demic programs and departments, 
many in the top 25 or even the top 
10 in the country, which grant a to-
tal of over 400 doctoral and mas-
ters degrees to graduate students 
each year. Lastly, there is the 
Scripps' Institution of Oceanogra-
phy, perhaps the single most impor-
tant site of biological research in the 
world. 

Our campus is just over 30 years 
old. It is no secret that it could not 
have possibly gotten to where it is 
today without the assistance of the 
federal government. We understand 
that your party ran on a platform of 
downsizing government, but we 
hope that in evaluating when and 
where to cut, you take into account 
the likely social and economic im-
pact of your cuts. In light of this, 
we believe the cuts on student aid 
being proposed in the "Contract 
with America" are not merely harm-
ful to our constituency, but contrary 
to the interests of the American pub-
lic as a whole. 

Traditionally, our university has 
had three primary funding sources: 
state funding of instructional eosts 
of lab and classroom construction, 
federal research grants, and federal 
student financial aid. However, in 
the last few years, decreasing fed-
eral research-grant aid and falling 
state aid for instructional expenses 
have been taken up by rising stu-
dent fees. While in 1990 a UC 
graduate education cost $1 ,800, to-
day it costs over $4,000 and over 
$6,000 for medical-school students. 
Clearly, expecting the State of Cali-
fo rnia, which provides more than 10 
percent of all undergraduate and

graduate degrees in the country, to 
suddenly reverse course to offset the 
cutbacks in federal student-loan aid 
is highly unrealistic. 

In the end, the crux of the issue is 
how much we value the future and 
how much we are willing to pay to 
ensure that this country will be a bet-
ter place in which to live a genera-
tion from now. Clearly, in the short 
term, education costs money. We be-
lieve, however, that the federal sub-
sidies not only reduce the cost of a 
degree for particular individuals, but 
are also an investment in the future 
well-being of our country, ensuring 
the existence of a bettcr educated 
populace and promoting social and 
economic development through re-

search and scholarship. 
We hope that you and your col-

leagues in the House Republican 
caucus reconsider your position and 
recognize the proposed cuts to the 
federal loan programs for what they 
are - a penny-wise and pound-
foo lish solution to our nation's eco-
nomic difficulties. Mortgaging our 
country 's future by limiting educa-
tional opportunity is no way to put 
our house in order. Indeed, without 
educated citizens, it's hard to imag-
ine how we will afford the payments 
on our nation 's debt at all.

Slave Auction 
Event Insulting 
Editor: 

It has come to our attention that 
a "slave auction" was held Wed. 
March 8 at UCSD. It is highly 
isturbing that the institution of sla-
very, the most ugly scar on the his-
tory of our country, is being treated 
in this flippant manner. 

The event is a slap in the face to 
both the African-Americans on 
campus, whose families were sub-
ject to the inhumanity of slavery, 
and to those who have fought for 

equality and civil rights over the 
centuries. In the past, other "slave 
auctions" have taken place on this 
and other college campuses. Such 
activities have resulted in abuse, 
humiliation and, in some cases, 
physieal injury to the "slave" vol-
unteers involved. Such activity has 
no place on this eampus, and we are 
ashamed that our educational facili-
ties were used for such an event. 

We understand that there was no 
malicious intent on the part of its 
sponsors. Therefore, it is our hope 
that the result of this occurrence will 
be education and awareness, and 
perhaps a greater understanding of 
the gravity of the issues which sla-
very carries. We also hope for the 
immediate ending of events similar 
to this one.

6 OPINION 

HEAP: 
Continued from pac. 4 
bons (CFCs) in the name of saving 
the ozone layer. 

Environmental hysteria has al-
ways been based on apocalyptic de-
ductions - such as tracking tem-
perature or atmospheric trend for a 
few years and then making dire pre-
dictions on the premise that the mea-
sured change will continue' at the 
pace at which it was observed. On 
the original Earth Day in 1970, Paul 
Eirich, the rabble-rousing leader of 
a generation past, predicted the im-
minent demise of the planet by glo-
bal cooling, by extrapolating the 
temperature trends during the 1960s. 
Now, identically faulty claims sup-
port the trendy arguments over glo-
bal warming and ozone depletion. 

So what's with the argle-bargle 
over the alleged disappearance of 
our ozone layer? Are we going to 
lose the planet? Or are we listening 
too much to people who should just 
get lost? 

To hear the likes of AI Gore tell 
it, there is an overwhelming consen-
sus within the scientific community 
that global warming and ozone 
depletion are destroying our envi-
ronment, and that only by massive 
government intervention in private 
industrj can we be saved. However, 
a 1992 Gallup poll of 400 meteo-
rologists and geophysicists found 
that, while 60 percent of them 
thought global temperatures rose in 
the last century, only 19 percent at-
tributed this to man-made causes. 
Greenpeacc itself surveyed 400 sci-
entists, and just 13 percent of them 
deemed runaway ozone depletion as 
probable. 

According to University of 

Maryland Senior Researcher Alice 
Parker, "The jury is still out [about 
ozone depletion]. After all, we've 
only been taking pictures from 
space for IS years. Now, we're try-
ing to predict, based on a IS-year 
sample of a planet four billion years 
old, global trends that span centu-
ries. It just can't be done." 

Yet, world-savers such as AI 
Gore persist: "The insistence on 
complete certainly about the full 
details of ozone depletion - the 
most serious threat we have ever 
faced - is actually an effort to 
avoid facing the awful, uncomfort-
able truth: that we must act boldly, 
decisively, comprehensively and 
quickly, even before we know ev-
ery last detail of the crisis." 

Acting boldly, decisively, com-
prehensively and quickly when we 
have no clear idea what the hell we're 
supposed to do is commonly known 
as a bad idea. Even if we overstate 
our case, the planeteers argue, our 
objective of environmental respon-
sibility is ultimately good. Can envi-
ronmentalists be forgiven for being 
overzealous for good intentions? 

No. 
Environmental laws are, by de-

sign, ham-fisted. The current ban on 
CFCs force automobile, refrigera-
tor and air-conditioning manufac-
turers to overhaul their products. 
Existing air conditioners will need 
to be scrapped, refrigerators thrown 
away. The Environmental Protec-
tion Agency estimates that imple-
menting the CFC ban will cost over 
$2 billion. This is money which can-
not be recycled, renewed or re-
placed. But I'm sure the unem-
ployed factory workers will be 
grateful to the environmentalists' 
contribution to the nebulous logic

behind cleaner air. 
The most disturbing aspect of the 

bad logic which surrounds the pro-
ponents of the CFC ban is the vio-
lation of the principle of local cau-
sality. That is, when a cat gives birth 
to two-headed kittens a block away 
from a chemical factory, the peren-
nially indignant planeteers march to 
the corporate headquarters, threat-
ening lawsuits. Bad things happen 
near bad industries. Yet, the fact that 
industry's harmful effects on the en-
vironment are localized is never 
mentioned in any discussion of 
ozone loss. 

If air conditioners truly caused 
ozone depletion, there should be big 
ozone holes over Las Vegas, Florida 
and my ex-girlfriend's car. Instead, 
ozone holes are clustered around the 
north and south poles, where, last I 
checked, there seems to be a scar-
city of refrigerators and air condi-
tioners. I've got a $50 bill in my 
wallet that goes to the first person 
who mails me a picture of Eskimos 
huddled around an air conditioner 
because it was getting too damn hot 
in their igloo. 

Do environmental issues warrant 
serious debate? Of course they do. 
Environmental degradation is a 
complex, multifaceted problem 
which needs serious scientific in-
quiry before we run headlong into 
regulating ourselves into bank-
ruptcy. Anyone who thinks that 
blindly increasing government con-
trol over industry can alleviate the 
impact of industrial waste should 
hop on the next flight to the heart 
of the formerly government-con-
trolled economy of what used to be 
East Germany, climb the fence 
marked Verbotten! and take a deep 
orink from the Rhine river.

maximize his production. But the 
farm happens to border a grammar 
school, and according to the eur-
rent law, pesticides cannot be 
sprayed within 90 yards of popu-
lated areas. Under "Takings," we 
would have to compensate the 
farmer for his losses - pay him 
to stop poisoning our children. 

The Republicans ' proposed leg-
islation could be applied to any 
situation in which public-safety 
laws financially hurt business, from 
the installation of handicapped 
ramps to the proper disposal of 
harmful chemicals. We desperately 
need laws which protect public 
health from private irresponsibility. 

In addition to "Takings," the 
"Contract With America" proposes 
"unfunded mandate" legislation, 
which would effectively bar the fed-
eral government from enforcing 
laws which impose costs in excess 
of $50 million on state and local 
governments. Under the GOP's leg-
islation, state and local governments 
would not be required to comply 
with federally legislated pollution 
control. Nor would they have to 
comply with public-health require-
ments of any future act of Congress, 
including the re-authorizations of 
such laws as the Safe Drinking Wa-
ter Act and the Clean Water Act , 
unless Congress agrees to reimburse 
states and localities for the costs of 
meeting the laws' requirements. 

The national standards on which 
we rely to ensure a safe and healthy 
environment are in trouble. State and 
local officials say they cannot afford 
to meet these standards, and that if 
the federal government is going to 

Monday, March 13, 1995 

impose such mandates, then it has 
an obligation to fund them. 

Federal standards have forced all 
50 states to enact environmental leg-
islation which has made tremendous 
progress cleaning upour air and wa-
ter. But there is much more work to 
be done. The Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention estimate 
that each year, over 940,000 people 
become sick and more than 900 die 
from drinking contaminated water. 
Weakening federal legislation 
through unfunded mandates would 
threaten public safety. We need to 
improve the laws by strengthening 
enforcement and preventing toxic 
pollution. 

Between 1987 and 1991, over 
130 Chemical I ndustry Political 
Action Committees contributed 
over $15 million to candidates who 
lobbied against environmental re-
forms . With all the corporate 
money being spread around, it is 
not surprising that few politicians 
have shown real leadership on the 
environmental issues. The environ-
ment is not only the National For-
ests Preserves, parks and wild-life 
sanctuaries - it's also the water 
that comes from our faucets, the air 
we breathe, the food in grocery 
stores. Having a healthy environ-
ment is a basic human right which 
should not be questioned by any-
one, especially corporate interests. 

During the same year in which we 
ce lebra te the 25th anniversary of 
Ea rth Day, we must realize that 
enough is enough. Now is the time to 
organize on our campuses and in our 
communities to clean up the planet. 
We cannot afford to settle for less.

Student of Color Conference Advocates CollectiveAction 
DIVERSITY: 
Participants discuss 
affirmative action 
By Warren Ho 
Senior Staff Writer 

Hopingio spark student political 
activism around such issues as 
Proposition 187 and affirmative ac-
tion, students from all nine UCcam-
puses met at UCSD last weekend 
for the sixth-annual Student of Color 
Conference. 

" It is about what students can do, 
so that they don ' t just sit around and 
complain anymore," said Confer-
ence Field Organizer Kimi Lee. 
"Through collective activity, you 
have students from all the UCswork-
ing together." 

The two-day conference con-
sisted of workshops, which dis-
cussed effective methods of politi-
cal activism, and featured entertain-
ment by the UCSD Gospel Choir, 
the Funky Fresh Pan-Ethnic Asian 
Girls and the Kaibigang Filipino 
Dancers. 

The theme of this year's confer-
ence was "Making the Personal Po-
litical: The next step toward pro-
active student solutions for empow-
erment and diversity." 

"I hope that this conference 
breaks down the political apathy of 
UCSD students, because govern-

ment politics do affect them di-
rectly ," said A.S. Vice President 
External Damien Wilpitz. 

"With ignorance and apathy, they 
don 't realize that bills and laws af-
fect them. Then, they get stomped in 
the face with things like Proposition 
187 .... Counting on the administra-
tion to solve problems is not hap-
pening," Wilpitz added. 

Affirmative action was one of 
the most widely discussed topics at 
this year' s conference. 

UC Regent Ward Connerly pro-
posed earlier this year to phase out 
the current policy of affirmative ac-
tion on the grounds that it was fun-
damentally inequitable to certain 
people. 

Students were encouraged to 
form coalitions and start speaking 
with the regents about the reassess-
ment of affirmative action. Other 
suggested tactics included phone-
ins, fax-ins and rallies at adminis-
trative offices. 

"We need to have a diversified 
student body and faculty in a diver-
sified state," said UC Regents Af-
firmative Action Chairman David 
Flinn. "Until we find another way of 
attaining that diversity, affirmative 
action seems to be the best way. 
Maybe outreach is a better way, but 
it is too expensive." 

Student Regent-elect Edward 
Gomez said, "by ending a program 

UCI Student Body PresIdent Acldrla Dratl and KImberly Perez attempt to dance the Tlnlkllne after 
a performance by the Kalban, FIlipIno Dancers durin, thIs weekend's Student of Color Conference. 

like affirmative action, the system is 
devouring itself. The system should 
be looking outward and building up, 
instead of cutting affirmative ac-
tion." 

Attendance was up from last 
year's conference, which was held 
at UC Riverside. About 150 people 

participated in this weekend's con-
ference. 

Poet Wanda Coleman closed the 
conference with a reading from a 
selection of her works. 

"We have to be able to articulate 
our problems. If massive action 
worked, we wouldn't have Prop 

187," said Coleman. 
The conference was funded by 

UCSD deans, registration fees, the 
A.S. Council, and by a $1,000 grant 
by Vice Chancellor Joseph Watson.

WALK: 
Continued from paJe 1 
worked last week to collect signatures for a 
petition demanding further review of the project 
prior to construction. They plan to hold a press 
conference and rally to protest Library Walk this 
afternoon. 

In the other corner are the walk supporters, 
composed of university administrators and the 
majority of the faculty on the Academic Senate, 
which voted against postponing the project on 
Feb. 28. 

The quarter-mile long 
walk, which has been on the 
drawing board since 1989, 
will connect the University 
Library with the new Cellu-
lar and Molecular Medicine 
Building on the south side of Gilman Drive. It is 
being constructed now in large part because the 
opening of Classroom Building One in Septem-
ber will flood the area with foot traffic. 

"T6e conflict between pedestrians and auto-
mobile traffic, I think, would be just lantamount 
to asking for an accident to happen. It's already 
difficult enough," Hellmann said. 

Library Walk will also improve drainage in 
the area, allow for better handicapped access 
and "enhance" the eucalyptus grove above the 
Price Center, according to Hellmann. 

But critics have refuted much of the informa-
tion supplied by the university to support the 
project. They also argue that the $2.5 million 
price-tag, coming mostly from Chancellor Ri-

August 1994, and reports by UC Riverside ento-
mologist Larry Hanks, there is virtually no beetle 
problem. 

The ORG report found less than one percent 
of the trees are infested. 

"From an entomological perspective, [the 
trees] are healthy," said Hanks, who has been 
studying the eucalyptus beetle for five years. 

Hellmann acknowledged the 50 percent fig-
ure was incorrect. He said the mistake was 
caused by University Communications when it 
used outdated information to prepare the sheet. 
"It's an unfortunate oversight. It's an error," he 
said. 

But the "oversight" was 
left uncorrected for months, 
even though FD&C knew 
the 50 percent figure was 
off by more than 49 percent. 

In an extensive one-hour Library Walk presen-
tation to the Guardian, senior campus planners, 
including Hellmann, never pointed out the error. 

However, Hellmann insists the faulty infor-
mation was not used during the lengthy campus 
design review process, an assertion backed-up 
by Biology Professor David Woodruff, who was 
~hairoftheCommitteeonCampusandCommu_ 
oity Environment (CCCE) when it reviewed 
Library Walk in 1992. 

According to Woodruff, the CCCE had di-
rect access to independent tree analysts' infor-
mation during its review process. 

While the trees are no longer threatened by 
beetle infestation, they should be replaced any-
way, according to Woodruff. "The trees here are 

chard Atkinson's discretionary 
funds, would be better spent on 
just about anything.

-Situ UIIOI'I Staffed by tree and foliage ex-

calls for the removal of 230 
trees, which will be replaced by 680 young 
eucalyptus trees at the conclusion of construc-
tion. 

An article in the UCSD Times, a staff and 
faculty newsletter, stated, "Campus officials 
say more than 50 percent of trees on campus are 
infested with eucalyptus beetle and replanting 

. will revitalize the groves." 
This information was also included in an 

information sheet produced by University Com-
munications which was widely distributed to 
campus groups, including the Guardian. 

During the Feb. 28 Academic Senate meet-
ing, Hirsch alleged the 50 percent figure was 
totally inaccurate. 

"[The administration has] tried very hard to 
fabricate evidence that the trees are sick," Hirsch 
said. 

He is right in that the statistic is completely 
wrong. 

According to an independent analysis by the 
Davey Resource Group (ORO), completed in 

perts, its sole purpose is to pro-
SEAC Member tect the campus eucalyptus park 
system, he said. Its creation, he added, was 
supposed to prevent just this sort of controversy. 

"I didn't want physicists and historians argu-
ing about tree health," he said. 
Half tile Story 

Students opposed to the Walk, however, are 
also playing fast and loose with the numbers . 

While the anti-walk petition announces, "We 
oppose the destruction of 250 eucalyptus trees 
for the sake of ' Library Walk,'" nowhere does it 
mention that the project also calls for the re-
planting of 680 trees. 

Hirsch argues the university does not really 
intend to replant the trees so the walk provides a 
"view corridor" from Oilman Drive to the Cen-
tral Library, an assertion supported by student 
opponents. 

"I'm skeptical [of the university 's plan to 
replant trees] because the administration has 
made statements in the past that were untrue," 
said anti-Library Walk activist and first-year

According to Doug Findlay, a 
partner in the architectural firm 
of Peter Walker Associates, 
which designed Library Walk, 
UCSD is one of the first college 
campuses to start integrating 
buildings and outside space. 

"It won 't be th is squishy

student·capacity Classroom 
Building One prompted the con-
struction of library Walk, ac· 
cording to Hellmann, but it has 
a number of purposes beyond 
directing foot traffic. 

While 230 trees will be re-
moved at the start of construe· 
tion, 680 trees will be planted 
to replace them. The replanting 
is an effort to preserve the euca-
lyptus grove as mandated in the 
Master Plan, according to Se-
nior Planner Pamela Jenkinson. 

The new trees will only be 
four feet tall when planted; how· 
ever, they are projected to reach 
at least 20 feet after only five 
years. "The good thing about 
eucalyptus is that grows very 
fast, " said UC Riverside euca-
lyptus tree expert Larry Hanks.

WALK: 
Continued ........... " 
Warren College student Carl 
Lennox. 

But there is no real evidence to 
support such a claim. In fact, just 
about every scrap of evidence avail-
able supports the argument that the 
trees will indeed be planted. 

"They'te going to get planted. 
There's no question about it," said 
Doug Findlay, a partner in the Ber-
keley-based architectural firm of 
Peter Walker and Associates, which 
designed Library Walk. He added 
that the general contractor hired for 
the project is legally required to 
plant 680 eucalyptus trees. 

A.S. President Carla Tesak, who 
sat on the Library Walk Committee, 
which examined the project over 
the summer, also said the trees will 
be planted. 

Rarel y, in fact, are people as sure 
about anything as they seem to be 
about the fact that 680 eucalyptus 
trees will be planted. 
... ..... , 

Funds for Library Walk was col-
lected from a number of different 
sources, but it primarily comes from 
the chancellor's discretionary funds. 

"[The funds] have absolutely 
nothing to do, and this is a part I 
want to emphasize, with student fees 
in any form or fashion," Hellmann 
said. "Obviously, we recognize the 
sensitivity there." 

However, the chancellor's dis-
cretionary funds can be used for 
virtually anything deemed "in the 
university's best interest" and are 
not restricted to capital improve-
ments, according to Vice Chancel-
lor of Resource Management and 

Planning John Woods. 
With fees skyrocketing and stu-

dent services plummeting, many 
have questioned the use ofS2.5 mil-
lion to build a fancy pathway. 

Hirsch argues that simply clos-
ing Hutchinson Way would be suf-
ficient to safely handle the foot traf-
fic from Classroom Building One, 
leaving the $2.5 million for other 
uses. such as longer library hours. 

Student opponents also criticized 
the high cost of the walk. The peti-
tion being circulated states, "We 
oppose spending 2.5 million dollars 
in [sic] a 'grand academic prom-
enade. '" 

Tesak said that while she is not 
directly opposed to the project, "I 
don't think [the funds) should be 
used for Library Walk." 

But some money would have to 
be spent upgrading the area around 
the new Classroom Building regard-
less. Approximately S500,OOO of the 
funding is being spent just to relo-
cate the parking spaces. In addition, 
funds would be required to make 
Classroom Building One accessible 
to wheelchairs, even if the walk 
were not constructed. 

According to Findlay, the uni-
versity put pressure on the archi-
tects to keep costs down. "We've 
been pushed at every turn to take 
money out of the project," he said. 
"[Library Walk is] not as good as we 
originally wanted it to be." 

The construction materials were 
downgraded and several features, 
such as fountains, were left out of 
the final plan. 

While the university could avoid 
spending a good portion of the $2.5 
million earmarked for Library Walk, 
it is obligated to spend a heap of

cash even without it. 
......... V .. , 

As with most campus contro-
versies, the debate over Library 
Walk returns to a familiar theme: 
whether student inputon the project 
is adequate. 

While there are student positions 
on the Campus Community Plan-
ning Committee, which reviewed 
Library Walk several times during 
the planning stages, by the time the 
A.S. was directly involved this sum-
mer the project was already off and 
running, according to Tesak. 

SEAC and CALPIRG were only 
told of the project last month, well 
after the design was set in concrete, 
according to Larson. 

"Students were never involved, 
as always," she said. "I feel like I've 
been left out of a huge process. " 

"There was very little student in-
put and that's wrong," agreed lennox. 

Both Larson and Lennox credit 
the lack of student involvement in 
Library Walk planning as a moti-
vating factor behind their protests. 

However, both those in favor.and 
those opposed to Library Walk have 
hurt their arguments with the use of 
suspect and flawed information. 

"I strongly support students being 
pol iticall y active and taking asland," 
said Tesak. "[But] when they do so in 
a rash and uninformed way it makes 
student protest lose credibility." 

The argument against Library 
Walk raises a number of important 
issues, most importantly the nature 
of student and faculty input in the 
review process and the reliance on 
often biased university-supplied in-
formation. But in this case, Tesak 
added, the protesters are "obviously 
uninformed. "

Manager. Having been appointed 
to this position by A .S. President, 
Carla Tesak, Lindstrom's new job 
entails su pervising all aspects of 
the elections process which range 
from organizing debate forums to 
overseeing the actual elections.

In basketball, the road to 
the final game for IAE was quite 
smooth as they defeated IN by a 
score of 79·59 in the semis. 
Reaching the finals for TKE, 
however, was not so easy. It took a 
last second effort to beat IX by a 
score of 42-40 in their semi· final 
game. For the third year in a row, 
IAE captured the basketball title 
over TKE winning by a score of 62-

narrowed the point difference to 
only five. But, one of the leading

Not being one to contain 
his views, Lindstrom is outspoken 
when it comes to giving his 
opinion of past elections. 
"Campus publications print an 
image of A.S. as a negative entity 
when they should be using more 
ink to focus on the really important 
matters," he affirms with 
vehemence. He firmly beliE'ves 
that every student should have a 
voice in the upcoming elections. 
H After all, H he adds, " A.S. is 
controlling your funds." With the 
A.S .. electionsonlyamonthaway, 
Lindstrom has his work cut out 
for him. His fervent desire is for a 
successful voter turnout rate and 

acquired through his parents who 
introduced him to it at the age of 
seventeen. 

Lindstrom's involvement 
in the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity began 
in the spring of his freshman year. 
Since then he has occupied 
numerous leadership positions 
including Social Chairman and 
Brotherhood Chair. Now in his 
fourth year and without a leadership 
position in the fraternity he 
describes himself as simply "a 
supporting brother."

llitons nipped By UCR 
RAIN: UCSD can't get revenge on Riverside, falling 5-3 in first game 
By Sean Rahlml 
Staff Writer 

Mother Nature took away the 
possibility of revenge for the UCSO 
basebalr team on Saturday. The Tri-

ton sluggers were 
scheduled to play 
the end of a two· 
game "home-away" 
series versus the 
UC Riverside High-
landers. 

As it turned out, 
the Tritons were 
sluck with another 

heartbreaking loss , UCSO was 
crunched by the Highlanders, 5-3, 
on Thursday at UCR. The second 
game, set for Salurday - which 
would have given the Tritons a shot 
at redemption - was rained oul. 

UCSO's Ryan Ward (3-2) started 
the firsl contest, giving up only one 
unearned run. The Highlanders, 
however, were able to score four 
runs off four crucial Triton errors. 

'" think [Ward] threw his best 
game of the year," Head Coach 
Robert Fletcher said, "We gave 

them runs by committing errors." 
The UCSD offense got a jump-

start in the form of some line·up 
changes, Eric Quandt moved to hit 
ninth in the order, and Jason Aguilar 
moved up one spot to lead-off. 

Craig Birk and Chris Miyake 
also switched places, with Miyake 
balling second and Birk balling 
third. All this confusion seemed like 
the perfect solution, as the first three 
UCSD batters got on base. 

Aguilar led off with a solid 
single, and Miyake followed with a 
hit of his own. Birk then stepped up 
to the plate and drew a walk, load-
ing the bases for Ihe Tritons, 

UCSO was not able to capital-
ize, though, wasling the bases 
loaded and no ouls opportunity. To 
dash the Triton hopes, AI DelFavero 
struck out and Carl Abramson 
grounded into an inning-ending 
double play, 

"When the other pitcher gets out 
of a jam like that, he 's going to be 
confident Ihe rest of Ihe game," 
UCSO's Steve Height said. "It was 
lough to start the game like that and 

not score, It's the same old story: 
We out hit them, bUI we just 
can't get the clutch hils." 

The Tritons did rack up 11 
hils total, but Ihey put onl y three 
runs on the board - mostly 
scores coming in the late stages 
of the game, 

On the positive side, Sirk 
(two hits) and Aguilar were 
UCSO's offensive standouls, hit. 
ling solidly from the top of the 
lineup. 

"The guys are pressing right 
now," Fletcher said, "We tried to 
shake things up in the line·up, 
but nothing changed, I try to let 
them know that I'm confident in 
them. I think it's a team slump," 

The Triton hardballers will 
travel to La Verne on Wednes-
day for a night game and then 
they will come back home to 
face Point Loma on Thursday, 

"I definitely think that if we 
win the next two games going 
into Spring Break, we'll come 
out playing much better after the 
week off," Height said.

UCSD Reigns in Rain 
TORREY PINED: The Triton 'A' squad earned a 
third-place, 314 score at the So. Cal. Tourney 
By Tedd Ladd 
Associate Sports Editor 

Loyola Marymount tallied a 325. 
Cal-State San Bernardino galliered 
a 316. SI. Mary's took home a 329. 

And this is called a 
'University Divi-
sion'? 

The UCSD golf 
team, entranls in the 
supposedly weaker 
'College Division,' 
proved it belonged 
among the elite at 
last weekend's 45th 

Annual So, Cal. Intercollegiate 
Tourney at Terrey Pines South 
Course. 

The second day of the tourna. 
ment was canceled due to rain, but 
on the first day, the Triton" A " squad' 
out played its competition, shooting 
a 314 overall. 't was good enough 
for the third·best team showing _ 
'University' or 'Collegiate' division 
- and a three-stroke win over its 
nearest opponent, the cocky group 
from Cal. State-Stanislaus. 

"Stanislaus is a Division 11 
school, and they came in with an 
arrogant attitude," UCSO Head 
Coach Mike Wydra said. "It was 
good that we beat them. At the time, 
I don't think they realized how 
tough Torrey Pines was." 

In addition, UCSO's "B" squad 
racked up a low 331 total score. 
Remarkably, it beat ollt Chapman, 
Pomona, Whittier, UC Riverside, 

Ihe Redlands and every other SCIA 
conference school. 

Indeed, the fact that the Tritons 
have so many talented athletes 
clearly worked against them at the 
tourney. UCSD split into an "A" and 
a "B" squad, but a "O"-teamer, Jor. 
dan Garrett, racked up an impres-
sive 76 score - which had to used 
toward "B"·team scoring only. 

As it turned out, the Triton " A" 
squad could have used the 76, a 
mark that would have pushed it into 
the second-place team slot. 

"ConSidering how we needed 
[Garrett] to be on the 'A'team, and 
considering how hurt we were, I was 
pleased wilh the outcome," Wydra 
said, "We really played with [the 
other teams]." 

Tops on the UCSD leaderboard 
was veteran Tom Brown, who shot 
a solid 75 on the course. Brown tied 
with UC Davis ' Steve Bemis for 
third-place overall. 

"[Brown) is really starting to 
play better," Wydra said. "He put in 
a good day of golf." 

After Garrett's score, Arnie 
Campbell chalked up the next best 
Triton performance, tallying a 78, 
along with four other players. Alex 
Behrend rounded out the UCSD 
scoring, shooting a 79. 

The Tritons will be back in ac· 
tion today in a tune.up match ver. 
sus Chapman and then in a meel 
against S.D, Golf Academy on 
Thursday,

Waves Drown UCSD 
BEACHED: Tritons fall to Pepperdine Waves in straight sets on 
Thursday night in Malibu by cores of 15-10, 15-5 and 15-1] 
By Jeremy Malamed 
Staff Writer 

Looking over the schedule of 
games for "matchups to watch" 
in the Mountain Pacific Sports 

Federation, 
one would 
probably pay 
very little at-
tention to the 
contest pitting 
the Pepperdine 
Waves against 
the ueSD Tri-
tons. 

After all, 
the two teams 

have combined for a grand to-
tal of only three wins in league 
play this entire season, and nei-
ther squad is going to be con-
fused with a serious playoff 
contender anytime soon. 

Out to chalk up its first 
league win of the season, UCSD 
(1-14; 0-12) journeyed to 
Malibu to take on the miserable 
Waves (6-8; 3-8). 

UCSD has played this season, 
making for some exciting vol-
leyball. 

This season's struggles are 
nothing new for the Tritons, 
who are enduring their third 
consecutive losing season in Di-
vision 1 play. But for the Waves, 
who traditionally run oneofthe 
best volleyball programs in the 
country, the year's losses have 
been extremely tough to deal 
with. 

But in the end, Pepperdine 
got in the last word, winning the 
marathon match in three 
straight sets, 15-10, 15-5, 15-11. 
Although UCSD failed to win 
a game in the match, the team's 
performance was one of its 
gutsiest efforts of the season -
the Tritons never got down on

and a game-high 10 digs. 
For the Tritons, it was Ed 

McMahon's hitting that kept 
them in the match. He notched 
21 kills and five digs overall. 
Veterans Tyson Kerr and Tom 
Black also helped the Triton 
cause, keeping the team men-
tally sharp when the situation 
got tough. 

The two veterans provided 
much-needed leadership to the 
young UCSD squad, keeping the 
younger players focused while 
also contributing with strong 
performances on the court - 16 
kills for Kerr and six digs for 
Black. 

But despite all the positives, 
the injury bug hit the Tritons 
again. UeSD was dealt another 
harsh blow when big man Matt 
Minehan went down in the third 
game with an ankle injury. 

Chuck Nguyen/Guardian 
George You (6) had 50 aulata, and Tyson Kerr had 16 kills va. 'epperdlne. 

Despite each team's poor 
record, the game was one of the 
more competitive matches 

Pepperdine's Lee Bradford 
put on a show for the home 
crowd, leading all players in the 
match with 25 kills, sparking 
the Wave's offensive artillery. 
John Bowling contributed to the 
Pepperdine effort with I I kills 

Minehan slammed down 10 
kills in the match before suffer-
ing the injury. He will have 
plenty of time to recover though, 
since the Tritons have two 
weeks off before their next 
match .

ARMY RESIRVE 

AIR: Is Jordan's 
return imminent? 
Continued from paee 20 
major motivation for returning. 

Shaq. He 's sick and tired of 
Shaq-fever. After all, Jordan is the 
best ever, but he's become a forgot-
ten man under the looming shadow 
of O'Neal. Some were already say-
ing the big man might become the 
best ever, if he can just win the title 
with Orlando. Mike had to prevent 
that, and if it meant lacing up those 
Nike Air Jordan's once again, then 
so be it. Jordan had skills. 

I just hope MJ realizes that he 
really has nothing to gain, and ev-

erything to lose. What if he 's lost 
the edge? The guy is 32, after all, 
and he's reportedly fifteen pounds 
heavier than his former bas~etball 
weight. When he retired, he was at 
the top of his game . . Air can't hope 
to return as good as before. 

Recall Jim Palmer. The hurler 's 
attempted comeback with the Ori-
oles severely tarnished an otherwise 
stellar career. Fans have a tendency 
to remember only what happened at 
the end . 

But we're talking about MJ 
here-he's used to making the im-
possible probable. Unlikely as it 
may seem, something tells me that 
when its all over, he'll have a fistfull 
of rings.

Fearsome Foursome Crashes NCAA Party 
REGIONALS: Four 
Triton fencers qualify 
for upcoming Nationals 
By Dan Kraft 
Sports ~ditor 

For the last two weeks, the 
UCSD men 's and women's fencing 
squads have busied themselves by 

qualifying for as 
many national 
competitions as 
possible. 

Last weekend 
at the NCAA 
We ster n 
Regionals , four 
Tritons qualified 
for the collegiate 
national tourna-

ment. This wee kend, UCSD at-
tended the Pacific Coast Fencing 
Championships at San Diego State 
and qualified six fencers for the 
open national championships. 

Vakov Zolotorev/ Guardian The team had been aiming for 
Western Regionals the entire sea-
son, and while it did not score ex-
tremely well as a squad, the indi-
vidual performances were worthy of 

Gabe Lawson (left) and Yuml Nishiyama both qualified for the NCAA National Championships to be held at Notre Dame In late March. 

recognition. 
Janet Wert z earned a trip to 

South Bend, IN for the NCAAs by 
capturing first place in the women's 
epee competition. Her stellar 17-1 
record over the exhausting day of 
fencing, which lasted from 10 a.m. 
until 6 p.m., gave her a first-ever 
shot at the nationals. 

"I don 't know what I'm going up 
against, but I'm just going to go out 
there and do my best," Wertz said. 
"I did well at conference and 

regionals, so if the NCAAs are any-
thing like that, I might have a pretty 
good chance." 

Foilers Gabe Lawson and Yumi 
Nishiyama, competing in the most 
hotly contested discipline, both 
earned third-place finishes and trips 
to Notre Dame for the champion-
ships in two weeks. The duo over-
came a field of seven teams, includ-
ing Stanford, Santa Cruz and Air 
Force, in addition to the Tritons ' 
usual conference foes. 

The final UCSD qualifier was 
Hal Aljibury in the men 's epee. 

Aljibury came out of nowhere with 
a tremendous performance at the 
regional meet, earning the respect 
and eventually the nomination of the 
National Selection Committee, 
which decides who goes and who 
stays when the NCAAs roll around. 

The Tritons ' Doug Saqui, who 
finished at the top of the conference 
meet in men's epee, was forced to 
settle for ninth and an alternate po-
si tion for the NCAAs, while the 
conference 's second-place finisher 
in women 's epee, UCSD's Suzanne 
·Walters, was unable to earn a bid. 

"Suzanne has a great chance to 
go next year," Head Coach Lisa 
Posthumus said. "She was just a bit 
inexperienced this year." 

The Tritons have high hopes for 
the biggest meet of their lives, 
which will take place right on the 
heels of finals. If UCSD can place 
well at the NCAAs, there is a chance 
that it could return to La Jolla as a 
nationally ranked competitor, de-
spite only being a West Coast Divi-
sion III school in a Division I, East 
Coast-dominated sport. 

"At NCAAs, I'm looking for a 

couple people to win [All-American 
honors]," Posthumus said. "We've 
never qualified four people before, 
and if we can do well, there's a 
chance we' ll be ranked nationally." 

As if the excitement of one na-
tional competition wasn 't enough, 
UCSD competed in the Pacific 
Coast tournament this weekend . 
Nishiyama, Lawson and Wertz all 
repea ted their qualifying perfor-
mances for NCAAs. They were 
joined by Saqui and Walters in the 
epee discipline and by Caprice Rob-
erts in the women's foil event.

"[Caballero] had the best meet," 
Boyd said. "She had some great 
splits in her relays and she had a 
lifetime best in every event she 
swam." 

Caballero was not the only Tri-
ton to pick up a share of the glory, 
however. McPherson grabbed hon-
orable mentions in the 100- (ninth), 
200- (12th) and 500-yard freestyle 
(15th) races. 

Parker ripped up the pool in the 
100- (fourth) and 200-yard back-
stroke (fifth) races to gather AIl-
American standing in those events 
to go with the status she earned in 
her medley relay efforts. 

The best race of the meet for the 
Trilons was in the 400-yard 
freestyle relay in which UCSD 
went head to head with the mon-
sler from Kenyon College and its 
26-time All-American (most tilles 
in any Division in NCAA history) 
Carla Ainsworth. 

UCSD entered a familiar group 
of faces (McPherson, Galdos, Ca-
ballero and Parker) and had a fairly 
solid lead on Kenyon going into the 
final leg, thanks to some careful 
manipulation of the lineup by 
Boyd. 

However, the unparalleled 
Ainsworth was able to chase down 
the Tritons' final swimmer, just 
touching her out at the wall for the 
victory. UCSD finished in 3:31 flat, 
just a couple hundredths shy of the 
all-time school mark.

His 'Air' -ness 
Is Back ... 

They were given up for 
dead. They were losers in a 
town of three rings. 

Takeuchi Takes Top Title 
The Chicago Bulls' dynasty 

had been dismissed by 
everyone: the fans, other NBA 
teams and especially Vegas 
odds makers - bookies 
computed the Bulls' odds of 
winning the NBA title at 18-1. 

But what's this?! Last 
week, the team's odds returned 
to a far more favorable 6-1 ? 
What's going on here? 

The MJ-factor, folks. 
Unless you've been 

hibernating in a cave, you've 
heard the rumors: Michael 
Jordan - the greatest basket-
ball player ever to hit .200 in 
the minors - is returning to 
basketball. 

What a surprise. From Day 
One of his "retirement," 
everybody and their grand-
mother knew Air would be 
back. Let's face it: Jordan 
walking away from basketball 
is like Orville Redenbacher 
quiting the popcorn business. 
It just doesn't happen. 

The question now is: Why 
the hell is he coming back? 
What is to be gained from this 
much-anticipated comeback? I 
mean, does the guy have 
anything more to prove to the 
world of basketball? His three 
championship rings certainly 
suggest otherwise. 

Well, maybe it 's the money. 
Perhaps Jordan decided that 
since he couldn 't hit baseballs 
like Jack Clark, he could at 
least fall into debt like the 
former Padres' slugger. 

Not likely, though. MJ must 
be worth more than Fort Knox. 
In fact, unless he's letting 
Orange County handle his 
investments, the bucks are 
very secure. 

SPLASH: UCSD took third in the women's swim 
and dive championships at Middletown, cr 
By Dan Kraft 
Sports Editor 

If UCSD's women's swimming 
and diving squad can continue to 
progress at this rate, it will be na-
tional champion by 1997. The Tri-
tons spent last Thursday, Friday and 
Saturday at Wesleyan College in 
Connecticut fighting 
it out with the best 
teams that Division 
III has to offer and 
they returned home 
with an overall third-
place finish (303 
points) behind only 
perennial national 
champion Kenyon 
(526), and Williams 
College (323). 

UCSD improved on its fourth-
place finish last year and hopes to 
continue its improvement, although 

Kenyon appears to be capable of 
stringing together another 15 con-
secutive national titles. The Tritons 
actually had a very legitimate shot 
at second place, but came out of the 
blocks a bit slow on Thursday which 
may have cost them the opportunity. 

"'We had a few glitches we had 
to get worked out, but 
we got better as the 
days went on," 
UCSD Head Swim-
ming Coach Doug 
Boyd said. "We did 
quite well to move up 
from fourth last year. 
Hopefully we'll keep 
on moving up." 

There were many 
standout performers 

for the Tritons, but perhaps the big-
gest star of the meet for UCSD was 
junior diver Sheri Takeuchi. 

Takeuchi was just warming 
up on Thursday afternoon 
when she captured second 
place and AU-American hon-
ors on the one-meter spring-
board with a score of 380.50. 
Teammates Brigitte Elfman 
(12th, 300.20) and Kristi 
Young (16th, 294.10) contin-
ued to hold the UCSD flag 
high as both earned AII-
American honorable men-
tions. 

Takeuchi's biggest 

Sheri Takeuchi took home a national 
title and record In the thrtHHneter. 

splash, however, came in the 
three-meter diving event, 
where she broke Triton 
graduate Julie Goldstein's 
national record, set just last 
year, with a score of 467 en 
route to the national cham-
pionship. Takeuchi's phe-
nomenal performance earned 

Shawna Caballero earned AlI-American honors In six events. 

her Diver of the Meet honors. Young 
once again grabbed an honorable 
mention with her 14th-place finish. 
Head Diving Coach Mike Fitchett 
took home the Coach of the Meet 
award as the result of his squad's 
excellent showing. 

Among the swimmers, sopho-
more sprinter Shawna Caballero 
may have made the biggest impres-
sion. Caballero earned Ali-Ameri-
can honors in four relays and two 
individual events and captured an 
honorable mention in yet another 
event. 

Her meet began with a second-
place finish in the 200-yard freestyle 
relay (1:37.33) along with team-
mates Heather McPherson, Chris-

tina Galdos and Carrie Parker. Next 
came a third-place tally in the 400-
yard medley relay (3:58.76) in 
which she teamed with Dustin Mat-
thew, Galdos and Parker. 

Caballero cruised through the 
water with the greatest of ease in the 
50-yard sprint to earn third-place in 
24.14 and that was just on Thurs-
day. 

Friday afternoon, Caballero once 
again teamed with Parker, Galdos 
and Matthew, this time in the 200-
yard medley relay as the fearsome 
foursome grabbed second place in 
the nation. Following that success, 
Caballero took on the field in the 
200-yard freestyle and won the con-

So was it the baseball fiasco 
that forced his hand? True, 
nobody would mistake him for 
Willie Mays (or even Bob 
Uecker, for that matter). There

So maybe he wants to 
restore his image, severely 
oi led by his inability to 

t.xceed baseball's infamous

')ossible, but unlikely. His 
lousy play on the diamond 
really can't affect his incred-
ible accomplishments on the b-
ball court. 

Most likely, all of the

It was the inaugural weekend of 
the crew racing season and, 

wouldn't

Mother Na-
ture decided 
to play the 
part of the 
spoiler. 

Both the 
men's and 
women's 

squads were slated to go up against 
their northern counterparts from UC

Irvine. Only the men who traveled 
to Irvine managed to get in their 
races, as the wind-whipped waters 
off the shores of San Diego pre-
vented the women from racing. A 
brief excursion onto the course 
which resulted in two water-logged 
boats was enough to convince ev-
eryone to stay away from the San 
Diego course. 

Luckily, the light wind and 
sunny skies in· Irvine were much 
more appropriate for rowing, and 
the men got down to business. In the 
first race of the season, the Triton 
crew of newcomers in the novice

eight went up against three boats 
from Irvine. 

UCSD was solidly in second 
place and closing on the front run-
ners when, with 800 meters to race, 
the Tritons experienced the equiva-
lent of a blown tire in auto racing: 
they "'caught a crab." With one oar 
dragging in the water, the UCSD 
boat quickly came to a virtual stop 
and fell out of contention. The hard 
working Triton squad rowed strong 
the rest of the way to grab third. 

In the junior varsity race, 
UCSD's struggles occurred before 
the starting gun went off. With in-

team, car troubles hitting a third and 
a fourth member suddenly leaving 
the team, the Tritons were forced to 
promote four members of the nov-
ice boat to junior varsity for the race. 

UCSD still managed to push the 
Anteaters over the 2,000 meter 
course, falling by a narrow seven-
second margin as it crossed the line 
in 6:22.7, while UCI stormed home 
in 6:15.8.

that we could," UCSD Head Coach 
Doug Thieman said. "We rowed
