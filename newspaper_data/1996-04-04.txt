After 10 years at the helm of the 
Scripps In titution of Oceanogra-

Tuesday that he will retire late this 
summer. 

"The instituti on is in really great 
shape, and I'm gelling on in age," 
Frieman said. " It eemed like the 

appropriate time to tum [Scripps]

eighth director of Scripps in July 
1986. His accomplishments in-

By Suketu Valshnav 
Slaff Wnler 

Interim Chancellor Marjorie 
Caserio, vowing to steer clear of a 

"monotonou ~" presentat ion, ad-
dre~sed various Issues affecting 
both UCSD and the state of Cali -
fornia at an open forum Tuesday at

"We are a bi llion-dollar com-

~aid . 
Approximately $267 million of 

the $1.1 billion UCSD received 
during fi sca l 1995 came from vari-

ous federal agen-
cies, including the 
National Science

and the National

In heropening remarks, Caserio

ance of $3 billion in bond to pay

technology, as well as new and

Caserio also said that because 
of Improvements in the state's eco-
nomic conditions, she believes the 
Slate budget will be kinder toward 
the IIniversity in the coming years. 
While Caserio characterized the 
state Senate 's altitude toward 
higher education as "favorable," 
she said the state Assembly was 
"hostile" toward the university. 

Caserio further noted lhat the 
1996-97 UC budget would include a 
two-percent cost-of-living increase 
lor all employees in the UC system. 

Although Caserio said the state 
budget looks mostly favorable to-
ward the university. she added that 
federal support may decrease in 
the future . Most of UCSD' s funds 
come from the federal government 
and from the private sector. 

Medical care is the main prob-
lem facing the university and soci-
ety as a whole, Caserio said. She 
argued that competition threatens 
the quality of care and that Hea lth 
Maintenance Organizations are 100 
wrapped up in red tape. Caserio 
also cite~ possible Medicare cuts as 
a chief area of concern . 

She then discussed the current 
contract UCSD has with the NSF 
for the operation of the San Diego 
Supercomputer Center. The 
university' s contract expires in 18 
months. and Caserio said there i 
"intense competition" in both the 
publi c and private sectcrs for the 
new contract. Pre-proposals are due 
at the NSF on April 15. 

The fo~m concluded with some 
comments about affirmative a~lion 
in the UC system. 

"By eliminating race for consid-
eration in admissions, there is no way 
we can achieve the type of diversity 
we have now," Caserio said. 

She stressed that the university 
will attempt to maintain its diver-
sity despite the setbacks imposed 
by SP-I and SP-2, the July 1995 
measures introduced by UC Re-
gent Ward Connerly which ended 
affirmative action in university ad-
missions, hiring and contracting.

Stanford Professor Lecture. on 
Nitrogen fixation In PI.nts 

The complicated but vital nitrogen-fixation process 
in plants will be the focus of a lecture by Sharon Long, 
a professor in genetics and molecular biology at the 
Howard Hughes Medical Institute at Stanford Univer-
sity. 

Nitrogen fixation is the process by which bacteria 
attached to the roots of certain plants take atmospheriC 
nitrogen and "fix' - or combine - it with other ele-
ments to form nitrates, which are essential to plant 
growth. 

Long's lecture, entitled "Genes, Signals and Cell 
Responses in the Rhizobium-Legume Symbiosis" will 
explain what has been Ieamed about the process and its 
importance to the future of agriculture. 

Long received her B.S. with honors from the Cali-
fornia Institute of Technology and her Ph.D. in 1979 
from Yale University's Program in Cell and Develop-
mental Biology. She has pioneered research in 'cheml-

cal signals which control cell fate and gene expres-
sion. 

The lecture is scheduled to take place on April 10 at 
4 p.m. in the Garren Auditorium and the UCSD Medical 
School.

SUllon as an old friend and as a 
man with "the most amazing el-
egance and civi lity of manner." 

During the discussion, Sutton 
descnbed the "ostracIsm of being 
black" - the double standard to 
which African-Americans have 
been subJccted from the tlillC they 
were first brought to the United 
tat s. 

SUllon cited James Madison's 
lueal of equal justice under the 
law, asklllg "How equal were the 
slave!" He pointed out that Tho-
mas Jefferson owned slaves and 
that "the Declaration of Indepen-
dence was wri tten by a man who 
was saying that the rest or u are 
free but not you black people." 

"[Such events] were bul mile-
stones on the often rocky road to 
close the gap between the white-
male American and the rest of us," 
Sutton said.

that "even today, they resist shar-

During his youth, Sutton said

was denied entry into the "wider

"There was a perce pilon that

R&geIds' FavOillism Shows 
Di ...... for Master Plan 

The Los Angeles Times reported in a series of articles last 
month that UCLA had for several years given preference in its 
admissions decisions to the friends, relatives and acquaintan-
ces of the state's rich and powerful. This wa no mere fund-
raising tactic, as UCLA Chancellor Charles Young would have 
us believe. It was nothing more than a callou di sregard for the 
state 's hallowed Master Plan for Higher Education by ome of 
the very individuals who swore to uphold it. 

The University of California was once one of the finest 
public universities in the nation. b!Jt the regents ' actions only 
highlight that this is clearly not the case any more. According 
to the Master Plan , the UC system will accept the top 12-and-
a-half percent - and only the top 12-and-a-half percent - of 
California's high school graduates. The plan has no provisions 
for admitting ill-qualified regents' daughters, business part-
ners' sons and major donors' children. 

If'these unqualified students were anybody else, they would 
have been rejected immediately. However, the regents have 
shown that a well-placed word can work wonders: Regent 
Meredith Khachigian 's daughter was rejected. but the admis-
sions office quickly reversed itself after Khachigian inter-
vened. After all, what 's one more student in an entering class 
or'thousands? 

To put in bluntly , it is one student who displaced another 
who rightfully deserves to be there. In fact, this whole admis-
sions mess is not an acceptance of "just one more student," but 
rather the rejection of another student who might have made a 
difference in the grand scheme of things - a potential Presi-
dent of the United States or discoverer of the cure for AIDS , 
who was denied an education so a friend's slacker son could 
get a free ticket into UCLA. 

From the moment UCLA' admissions office bowed to that 
first request. it sent an unmistakable signal that it was for sale 
to the highest bidder. And as higher education in California 
hits new lows, the almighty dollar strikes again. 

Irons' Actions Over Cross 
Are Pointless and Childish 

II 
UCSD Professor Peter Irons may have had a point in hi s 

ongoing argument with the City of San Diego over the transfer 
of the Mount Soledad cross to a private. Christian organiza-
tion . He may have had a legitimate reason to be angry, because 
the.city may have violated open-bidding laws in the quick 
traPlsfer of the property . 
. However, Irons ' recent actions - his childish inSistence in 
holding an atheist service on Easter at the Mount Soledad site, 
his shameless attempt to dupe the city into giving the permit to 
Christian groups instead . and his weak rhetoric backing up his 
ploy - has instead destroyed the validity of Irons' previous 
argument. After all. what is Irons really trying to prove? Is he 
truly fighting for further separation of church and state, or is 
he trying to attract media attention to himself? 

Filing for a permit to use the land under the Mount Soledad 
cross for an Easter-day atheist "celebration" does nothing to 
accomplish his goals of gelling the cross removed. Instead. it 
sends an spiteful, malicious message to the Christian groups 
who have peacefully held mass there for over 44 years. After 
all, Irons could have applied for a permit that afternoon, or 
perhaps the day before. if all he was trying to do was have a 
"celebration. " 

No, Irons was clearly trying to be antagonistic, despite the 
cheerful reasoning he gave for his decision : "My purpose in 
applying for the permit was to show that parks are open to all 
people, every day of the year, even Easter," Irons said. News 
flash, Professor Irons: The parks are open to everyone, every 
day of tbe year, including Easter. Anyone could have atte"ded 
the annual Christian service or ventured into the park while it 
was taking place. Irons' intent was simply to provoke. 

The lesson in this whole'Mount Soledad mess is to practice 
what one preaches. If Irons is truly concerned over fairness to 
all groups. he should have considered the implications of his 
antics. and how they would severely impact the Cltristian 
community. And if Irons really wants to contest the lelaJily of

ALL THE NEWS THAT WAS

COMMENTARY: Spring Break set off a rash of annoying and 
pointless news stories, ruining an otherwise relaxing week

H~ 
The Voice oj 

Reason 

After II grueling weeks of 
classes and finals, every UCSD 
student was ready for Spring 
Break- a time to relax, to for-
get about the stresses of co llege 
and to soak up the plea antries 
of lire beyond campus. 

But, alas, that was not pos-
sible this year. 

College students found 
themselves with more time on 
their hands during the seven-
day hiatus, 
ample oppor-
tunity to pay 
more attention 

, 
~, to news and 

current events. And I pity those who 
actually did - no single week has ~ 
been as marred with inane and irratio-
nal incidents as this Spring Break. 
Some of the lowlights which ruined 
the week: 

on such an inconsequential news story was a shame; 
and it also started Spring Break in the wrong direc-
tion. 

By Monday, Jesse Jackson's name was in the news. 
practically ruining the enti re week from the outset. Sure 
enough, there he was, spouting another misguided opin-
ion about another silly is ue. This time, the Academy 
Awards were his larget. Because only one black was 
nominated for anything, the academy had to be racist. 
There could be no other explanation. None. It was pure 
racism. 

But once again, Jackson represented'll significant 
group of people who automatically cry 
racism for any race discrepancy. After 
all, it 's the easiest, most readily avail-
able explanation and it carries power-
ful shock value. But it holds no more 
validity than lhat. 

First, just as final s wrapped up and 
we began our ma s exodus off cam-
pus, the newspaper headlines blasted 
the UC regents for having given pref-
erential treatment to personal friends 
and relatives in hiring and admissions. 
Oh, no. Supposedly - as the outcry 
at all UCs went - this proved the ul-
ter hypocrisy of the regents. How 
could they possibly be so opposed to 
affirmalive action, only to tum around 
and give jobs to friends or acquain-
tances?

Later in the week, President Clinton 
was at it again, pushing for his ever-

not a good idea? In the first place, 
Clinton constantly notes how a family 
cannot survive on a minimum-wage

of people earning minimum wage are

or people who did them a favor in the past. It's all pan 
of networking, and it validates the overused, but accu-
rate, phrase: "It's not what you know. it's who you 
know." The regents knew some qualified people who 
could fill some aVlilable positions. and they hin:d them.

The UCSD Guardian OPINION S 

COMMENTARY: We must remember that health care is not a right, and that medical savings accounts are more 
worthy options than socialist-type Health Maintenance Organizations 

AMERICAN HEALTH CARE SHOULD BE PRIvATIZED 
By Fa,.am Shadab 
Special to the Guardian 

Today 's universi ty st udents 
will soon need 10 determine the 
quality and quantity of health care 
they will receive once they be-
come independent. And any uni -
versity student today should know 
that current trends within health-
care politics will be tomorrow's 
consumer reality. 

Once taken off parental, schol-
arship and loan-program doles , 
today's university students will be 
cast into the always confusing uni -
verse of health care, and Ihey are 
likely to be left reeling from the 
sheer enormity of choices. Some 
may find a secure job with a great 

. benefits plan which will cover 
their medical costs. Others may 
se lect one of a vanety of private 
health-care provision plans. such 
as Health Maintenance Orgam za-
tions (HMOs), private insurance 
or nothing at all . 

The coming conflict is likely to 
create resentment toward the en-
tire establishment - with doctors, 
insurance rirms and pharmaceuti-
t:al companies raulted for being 
too greedy. and bureaucrats 

blamed for not delivering on their 
promises of a kinder, gentler 
"health care for everyone" nation. 
In fact . the coming years wi II 
likely prove to be formative in 
defi ning the face of medicine, the 
status of doctor-patient relation-
ships and the role (if any) Big 
Brother government should play. 

The first step toward construct-
ing a healthy medical industry is 
to identi fy th e relationship be-
tween health-care providers and 
health-care consumer . The medi-
cal industry is no different from 
any other industry - il operates 
best if free from constraint. 

Medicine does not exisl with-
out omeone to produce it. It is 
created by the doctors and phar-
maceutical companies who choose 
to devote their lives to the medi -
cal profession. In thi sense, they 
are the prOViders, and what they 
provide is a privilege. Medicine. 
like all technology. is no one's 
birthright. 

When this nation was founded, 
specific principles of individual 
liberty were enshrined in a gov-
ernment establi hed to maintain 
the 'overeignty of the individuals

The medical 
industry Is no 
different from 
any other Industry 
- It operates 
best If free from 
constraint. 
over which it governs - one of 
the grea tes t steps mankind has 
ever taken. But its brilliance did 
not stop there; the Founding Fa-
thers also installed into the system 
a self-protection mechanism : The 
Constitution guaranteed indi vidu-
als protection from the govern-
ment. For the first time in history. 

individual libeny was truly pro-
tected, and citizens did not expect 
more than the protection of their 
basic rights. 

However, time has eroded 
many of the Constitution's impor-
tant principles. Many began to re-
gard individual liberty as violable, 
and a culture of entitlement was 
born. Suddenly, all thing became 
rights when before they were op-
portunities - free to be pursued 
along with life. liberty, property 
and happiness. 

The impact of this erosion has 
been felt mosl strongly in the 
health-care industry. Guaranleed 
medicine is just a natural by·prod-
uct or an entitl emenl-happy soci-
ety. But as with all guarantees, 
something musl be there to back 
it up. In this case, it is the health-
ca re professionals - namely doc-
tors - who are expected to shoul-
der the "medical needs" of an en· 
tire ociety. Their right to practice 
medicine on their own terms is 
vanquished in the proce s. 

lr the government launched the 
hellllh -care industry inlo the 
stratosphere of free economic 
forces , where companies compete 

wilh one another to provide the 
better product, it will yield bigger, 
better and faster products. In other 
words , this "free-market heallh 
care" will lead to a higher-quality 
medicine available to more people 
at a lower cost. The companies, 
along with doctors, will provide 
the best because it is, economi-
cally speaking, a mailer of Ii fe and 
death. This is the fact of free-mar-
ket economics which allow for 
infinite progress . 

Contrast the level of medical ' 
and technological achievement 
seen in this "semi-free -market" 
country with that of other nations. 
such as Canada. Sweden. Norway 
and Britain, which practice social-
ized medicine. The medicine they 
have to parcel out to their popu-
laces origi nated , in almost all 
case ', in the United States. In ef-
fect. these nations are "medically 
dependent" upon the research and 
development that our economic 
structure foster rather than hin -
ders . Where would Ihey be with-
out a nation like the United States, 
where competition sti II has some 
rree reign ?

It would require a significant boost 
to allow the poorest families to sur-
vive more comfortably. But this is 
not a socialist country (although it's 
heading that way), and we should 
not dictate to employers how much 
they should pay their employees. 
Simple supply and demand will take 
care of that. 

Still, while raising the minimum 
wage won't greatly benefit those 
earning the money, it will actually

uninsured Americans. 

Liberal fearmongering pro-

of warnings about the di sastrou~ 
I.:onsequences of allowing an in-
dustry to run free wilhout regula-

The fractured logic here is that 
medicine under such circum-
stances will become more expen-
sive and less accessible. 

The new approach seem to be

to pay more for each worker, they 
will inevitably cut back on jobs, 
thereby increasing the unemploy-
ment rate. Also, employers will be 
forced to raise prices to compensate 
for the increased expenditure to-
wud labor. This will not only lead 
to inflation in the economy, but it 
will also render the poor worker's 
new raise obsolete. He will not be 
able to afford anything that he 
couldn't previously afford. As his 
wages go up, so do prices.

aliens at Miramar. This entire fiasco

ground between government inter-
vention and pri vate-sector compe-
tition . Both Republicans and 
Democrats have been scrambling 
to be the first to bring forth new

tion of HMOs, fostered by govern-
ment support, is an example. It is 
here that the Cl., rent battle in the 
war for unrestrained health care is 
being arduously fought. 

Joining an HMO is akin to put-
ting oneself on a diet where only 
the absolute essentials are pro-

drives managed care is consumer

flights, one month sees over 10 
crashes?! 

This is one of the most bizarre and 
perplexing incidents ofthc year-but 
hardly any news station or newspa-
per has addressed the issue as if it were 
out of the ordinary. Instead, we are 

both patients and doctors - is the

is being fought by groups such as 
Americans for Free Choice in Medi-

include Medical Savings Accounts

MSAs are set up and owned by 

individuals who would benefit from 
a stable financial health base, which 
is essemially a health "fund ," and 
the flexibility of not having their 
health insurance tied to their current 
employer. 

It i estimated that $200 billion 
will be freed up by MSAs if they 
were to take effect. The "middle-
men," represented by the govern-
ment and insurance companies, 
would be taken out of the process, 
and a more stable doctor-patient dy-
namic born out of a free market 
would be fostered .

Sutton supports

Continued from ..... 3 
to affirmative action, this is pri -
marily the fault of the selection 
committees and not of the policies 
themselves. 

Though Sutton asserted he did 
not benefit from the system of af-
firmative action which is currently 
in place, he said that he was as-
sisted by a form of affirmative 
action he defined as "access to an 
opportunity. " 

According to Sutton, the anger 
surrounding the issue of affirmative 
action stems not from the people, 
but rather from politicians. 

"Don't you feel a lillie anger 
when you hear that mM has let go 
thousands of people, and the next 
day the stock of the company has 
gone up? My theory is that [people] 
reach for a scapegoat," Sullon said. 

"It must be an awful thing to be a 
white male and to have all these 
privileges for so long and 10 now 
have to share," he added. "(think if 
I were white working class, J would 
be a little angry 100." 

Looking to the future, SUllon said 
that if Bob Dole, a friend of his, 
were to be elected, he would not bc 
as anti -a ffi rmative action as he 
c'Omes across in his election rheto-
ric. 

If afli rmalive-action programs 
were db man! led, Sutton sa id thai 
otheredul:allonal programs, such as 
chaner.schools on co llege campu,cs, 
could help gI ve minority students 
an equal opportunity. 

However, Sutton added lha! af· 
ter the electi on is over and the real 
issues of low wages, downsizing 
and corporate greed are being dis· 
cussed. the fervor over the end of 
arlirmative action will pass. 

Sutton works as a lawyer and is 
also the owner of nearly a dozen 
radio and TV stations. He was bor-
ough president of Manhattan, the 
chairman emeri tus of the Inner City 
Broadcasting Corporation and the 
recipient of the National Associa· 
ti'On for the Advancement of Col-
ored People Springarn Award. 

In addition, Sutton played a ma-
jor role in Ihe Civil Rights move-
ment and continues to live and work 
in the Harlem neighborhood which 
he said "built" him.

·Whether in Japanese or 
dubbed in English, anime 

has stateside appeal 

Although the buzz about "ani me" has been around sincc the days of "Speed Racer," "Baltle of the Planets," "Starblazers" 
and even "Astro Boy," thi s style of 
animation has only recently gained 
the attention of the mainstream 
pUblic. 

The real distinction which epa-
rates anime from traditional car-
toon animation is 
rather transparent. 
The easily identifi-
able differences 
between 
shows 

anime 
and old 

favorites such as 
Scooby-Doo, The 
Archie Show and 
the Jetsons seem to 
jump out al the 
audience. even after the only first 
vlewmg. The "big eyes" and the 
exaggerated facia l expressions are 
just some of these unique qualities. 

The tories and characters arc 
al~o lar different from anything 
else which aired a ner ~choo l or on 
Saturday momings. Nobody identi-
fied it until anime programming 
achieved its own cu lt following, 
particularly among older audi-
ences . 

"Japanimation" was one of the 
earliest names given to ani me, a tag 
which makes most die-hard fans 
(dubbed "otakus") wince in pain. 
While it was a clever contraction of 
"Japanese animation," most view-
ers stopped using the term years 
ago. An otaku calls the sustenance 
in question "ani me," (short for ani-
mation, which is difficult to pro-
nounce in Japanese) - and such a 
fan has been known to start fights 
with those who would label it oth-
erwise. 

A growing number of individu-
al already recognizes the innova-
tive art of ani me. But, for those of 
you who dismiss cartoons as kid 
stuff, it's time to approach the sub-
ject with a new perspecLive. 

Japanese artist Osamu Tezuka is 
credited as the progenilDr of what 

has today become a multi -mi llion 
dollar industry. It has only recently 
begun to seep into the American 
entertainment mainstream in full 
force. Tezuka created uch Japan-
ese classic characters as Jungle 
Emperor. Kimba the White Lion 
(who was such an endearing char-
acter, Disney decided to make its 
own movie about a certain lion 
with uncanny si mi laritie) and 

Astro Boy. 
Most Japanese in 

the 19505 grew up 
with these charac-
ters , which are as 
well -loved over 
there as classic Dis-
ney characters are 
here in the United 
States. It's been said 
that without Tezuka 

and Manga - Japanese pulp 
comics - anime would never have 
evolved into what it is today. 

Since the 1950 , thc face of 
an ime has changed immensely. 
Although many argue that anime 
hit its peak in Japan back in the 

1980~ , t he current proli feration 
among American and European 
importing companies seemingly 
refutes that clai m. 

Attempting to make anime 
"more accessible" to the average 
American, most companies pro-
duce dubs (instead of subtitled ver-
sions) of their videos . The original 
voice tracks are replaced with Eng-
lish-speaking actors and actresses, 
a practice which conlinues to irk 
many long-time otakus - although 
some are produced better than oth-
ers. The issue of dubbing versus 
subtitling continues to be a topic of 
endle s bickering. 

Otaku purists usually prefer the 
original Japanese voices (with ub-
title ) because the original actors 
put more emotion into their charac-
ters, whereas the average viewer 
may not want to have to deal with 
the unpleasant experience of read-
ing rather than listening to the 
video. Most cOmpanies seem to

Almodovar's New Look 
Director goes mainstream with 

The. Flower of My Secret 
By Jeff NI .... 
Hiatus Editor 

In a recent interview with the Los Ange-
les Times, Spanish director Pedro 
Almodovar said his next film may 
be the first he mues in the United 
States. With hi s current movie, The 
Flower of My Secret, he shows 
signs of moving toward that reality, 
replacing his quirky comic sensi-
bilities with melodrama. 

This is not to say that Almod-
ovar has sold out. The Flower of 
My Secret sometimes strokes powerful emo-
tional chords, as Leo (Marisa Paredes) tries 
to come to terms with a failed marriage. BUI 
Flower comes off as a bit too bland, particu-
larly in comparison with Almodovar 's previ-
ous work . 

The plot centers around Leo, a writer who 
uses the pen-name Amanda Gris to publish 

popular, sentimental novels. Leo's writing 
career is in jeopardy, however, because she is 
unable to complete the three books her pub-

lisher requires by contract. She 
meets with a publisher, Angel 
(Juan Echanove), who, oblivious 
10 her identity as Gris, has her 
write a review of a Gris' novel for 
his newspaper, EI Pais. 

Leo finds herself lorn between 
the initial excitement of possibly 
writing for £1 Pais and her eventu-
al dissatisfaction with the entire 

prospect. But when her husband, Paco 
(Imanol Arias), a NATO sold ier lrying to 
keep peace in Bosnia, tells her he will return 
on a 24-hour leave of absence, she forgets 
her problems and prepares to meet him. 

Their meeting only makes things worse 
for Leo, a Paco, after announcing Ihal his 
24-hour leave has been reduced to two hours, 

Courtesy 
Drtnldnc the ni&llt .wIlY: Antonio (left) shares a drink with Leo (right), while director 
Pedro Almodovar (middle) looks on. 
tells her that their marriage is beyond saving. 
Leo is crushed and downs a boule of tran-
quilizers, passing out on the street before 
Angel finds her and takes her to his home. 
After learning that her friend has had an 
affair with Paco, Leo accepts the fact that he 
wi II no longer be a part of her life. 

It 's not easy to discern Almodovar's pur-
pose in depicting Ihe neurotic behavior of a 
writer who cites Virgi nia Woolf and Djuna 
Barnes among hcr favorite authors. On one 

level, Almodovar seems to sympathize 'with 
the plight of an intelligent yet emotionally 
unstable artist. On the other, he appears to 
feed stereotypes about women and mental 
illness. 

!t 's uncertain whether Almodovar's next 
movie will be filmed in Ihe U.S .• but hope-
fully he will slill address complex issues, 
even if hi s sharp sen c of humor dulls. 

The Flower of M Secret opens t morrow 
at the Park Tlleatrc in Hillcrest.

Guardian Reporter 

The British pop group Radio-
head broke through in 
the United Slates wilh 
its first single. "Creep," 
from its debut album, 
Pablo Honey. Touring 
the United States since 
last year, Radiohead 's 
"High and Dry," the sin-
gle from its second 
album, The B~nds, has 
continued to increase the band's 
popularity. Bassist Colin Green-
wood discussed the band's 
crossover appeal as the group 
cruised through the California leg 
of its lOur.

The band sOWids cool enough to

Sounding like a female versiQn 
of the ~alace Brothers, Rel5in (for-
mer Rodan bassist Tara Jane 
O'Neil and Ruby Falls guilarist 
Cynthia Nelson) captures the 
Brothers' twisted country balladry 
on its full -length debul. Given 
images like "cucumbers dipped in 
ink" and "wet dingos and locomo-
tives," ii's anybody's guess what 
the lyrics are about, but despite the 
cryptic lyrics, Retsin creates a 
unique mood with Egg Fusion. 

Retsin will perform on Tuesday 
at the Che Cafe.

Day Two began with Monroe re-
turning for 1IlOIC, this time in abc 400-
1M, where she took home another AlI-
American mention with 12th place. 
Kristen Kemmer got into the act as 
well, taking 13th in the 100bunerlly. 

The 200 free was next on the 
agenda, and UCSO made a strong 
showing as Parker began an incred-
ible day of competition. The senior 
sped to a school record of I :54.48 and 
founh place. followed by McPherson 
(12th) and freshman Jenny Irwin 
(15th). 

The 100 breast was another event 
heavily attended by lhe Tritons. and 
Sarah Chu left an impression, finish -
ing third in a UCSD record time of 
I :06.25. Byrne was right on her heels, 

The UCSO Guardian 

however, grabbing fourth in 1 :07.04. 
Parker then rerumed in the 100 

back, IMine sev_ in I :00.19. That 
wasn't all for the senior, though, as 
Palter regrouped after only a few 
minutes rest to anchor UCSO's 800 
free relay team to a national champi-
onship in a school-record time of 
7:41.53. Parker's supporting cast in 
that lille-winning relay included 
McPherson. Irwin and Byrne. 

"1 swam five events between !he 
prelims and finals and had only a few 
minutes of rest between races in the 
evening,"Parleersaid. '1couldn'lhave 
done it without [Boyd) and the team." 

Despite Parleer's herculean efforts, 
UCSD remained in third place with 
248 points to Denison's 261 .

o 

I , 

"We were so tired and emotion-
ally drained by the last day," Pllker 
said. 'We really had a gul check." 

Kemmer started things off well for 
UCSO with an eighth-place finish in 
the 200 back. Parleer and McPherson 
then teamed up to grab fourth and 
10th, respectively, in the 100 free. 

The 200-yard breast saw fourTri-
tonseam A11-AmericanstJltUs. Byrne's 
blazing time of 2:22.03 in !he event 
earned her a national championship in 
addition 10 a school record. She was 
followed by teammates Chu. Monroe 
and Shelly Tabke i!l 10th, II th and 
16th, respectively. 

The three-meter springboard saw 
the return of both Triton divers. 
Takeuchi, amazingly, rounded out her 

SPORTS 15 

caRler with her second title of the 
championships, while Young finished 
a solid sixth place. 

In the final event, the 400 free 
relay, UCSD's McPherson, Irwin, 
Byrne and Parlcer bring home a third-
place finish. By day's end, UCSO 
held second by a comfortable 44-
poinl margin over Denison. 

Byrne ended the meet in fourth 
place overall individually, while 
Parker rounded out her UCSD career 
with 28 All-American honors, the most 
possible. 

"It doesn't seem like [so many)," 
Parleer said of her honors. "It was so 
fun that it was just an extra. If this 0 
hadn't been the team it was, it wouldn't 
have been as fun. I miss il already."

Beavers Damn UCSD, Win Handily 8-i, 6-0 
STRUCIGLING: The Tritons couldn't muster any offense against the visiting Beavers from Buena Vista University (IA) 
By Mike St.n,e 
Staff Writer 

Shortly after finishillg the first 
day of spring classe~. the UCSD 
women 's softball team hosted the 

Beavers from Iowa's 
Buena Vista nlver-
sity. The Trttons 
dropped bOlh games. 
their 15th- and 16th-

~t raigh t los~es, R-I and 
6-0. 

UCSD fell behind 
early in the opener 

when Buena Vista scored five runs in 
the top of the first inning. 

"They're a strong team," Triton 
Head Coach Patricia Gerckens said. 
''They are known for having a good 
ballclub. They hit the ball well and 
played solid defense. Because we 
haven ' t been scoring a lot of runs, 
falling behind early like ,Ihat really 
hurts." 

The big blow ofthe inning came 
off the bat of Beaver first baseman 

Andi Royster, who sliced a three-
run doubledown the right-field line. 

Buena Vista, aided by question-
able offi ciating, put three more runs 
on the board in the second inning. 
With two outs·and runners on firs t 
and second, 11 Beaver hitter bounced 
a ground ball to Mi ssy Belmer at 
shortstop. 

Belmer fielded the ball and threw 
to fir t base in time for the apparent 
fi nal Ollt of the inning. The home-
plate umpire, however, ruled the 
runner safe. 

"I don't think that umpiring will 
ever determine games," Gerckens 
said, Ubut that particular call really 
hurt us. Even the Olher coach said 
that he missed that one." 

'The two-out single loaded the 
bases for sophomore catcher Jodi 
Reeder, who lofted a two-run single 
10 cenler. 

The UCSD defense silenced the 
Beavers after the second inning, bUI 
the damage had been done. 

In the seoond game, the Beavers 
slruck for a run in bolh the firsl and 
econd innings and added three more 

in the fourth, while Buena Vista 
pitcher Lisa Schuler held the Tri -
tons to just two singles. Both hits 
came courtesy of sophomore right-
fielder Jessica Plancich, who sent 
two of Schuler' soffenngs nght back 
up the middle. 

U[Plancichl IS really gelling a 
piece or it ," Gerckens said. "A lot of 
il has to do with conlidence. When 
she steps in the box, you can sec thai 
she is determined to hit." 

The Tritons are encouraged by 
their defense, whicb has been mak-
ing the routine plays, as well as the 
peclacular ones. 

The Tritons only committed one 
error on the day, and freshman .out-
fielder Kelsey Bennett made an 
awesome diving catch late in the 
second game to keep the lead-off 
batler from reaching base. 

The Tritons are hoping their bats

Ultimate Disc 

The UCSD men 's u!timate-disc 
team took lirst place in the UC Davis 
Ultimate invitational on March 23 
~__ and 24 by defeating 

~~~ Palo Alto in ~~ the finals, 13-
-.;;;:: I I. 

First-day competition was fi erce 
for the Air Squids. who compeled 
without many of their expericnced 
athlete . This gave the younger play-
ers a chance to prove themselves 
against five college and alumni 
squads, including the UCSD alumni 
team. 

''The first-year players gained a 
lot of experience playing together," 
said Kevin Lenaburg. "The Squids 
often played an entire team of seven 
first-year players ." 

Finishing with a record of2-3, the 
ultimate-disc team advanced to the 
elimination round on Sunday . 

UCSD scored vi ctories in the 
quarterfinals and semifi nals of the 
invitational before heading on to the 
finals competition against Palo Alto. 

The score remained close through-
out the final match; and after a strate-
gic time-out, UCSD took position in 
front of the end zone with the lead. 
12- 11. 

Larry "Meat" Purcell caught the 
disc in the end zone to score the linal 
point. giving the game and touma-
menttriumph to the Air Squids from 
San Diego.

and Jefferson took eighth and 12th, 
respectively. 'The day' s events were 
capped by a phenomenal race in the 
800 freestyle relay. wjth Parkinson 
blazing a trail to the lead on the third 
leg, only to see the lead evaporate on 
the last lap. 

The linal day was highlighted by 
Tudury and McAteer triding onto 
the awards stand in the 1650freestyle, 
3rd and 6th, respectively. and by 
Burgasser achieving a national title 
on the three-meter board. 

For Burgasser, hi s victory on the 
three-meter was an unexpected sur-
prise which catapulled him 10 diver-
of-the-year honors. His efforts also 
helped Triton diving coach Josh 
Curtiss earn c(}-coach of the year. 

'''The last thing in the world ( was 
expecting was to win the three-meter," 
Burgasser explained. "( was pleas-
antly surprised, to say the least." 

The incredible finishing touches 
Burgasser put on his career, in addi-
tion to All -American swims by 
Parkinson (10th in the 100 free) and 
Bruner (13th in the 200 breast), 
clinched fifth place for the TritonS, 
who once again joined the elite of the 
Division m swimming world. 

". think we sort of started a new 
tradilion here since last year's nation-
als," ParlOnson said. "With some good 
recruiting and lhe talent we' ve got 
here already, we should be able to 
keep il going."

The UCSD waterski team 
opened its 1996 spri ng season 
with impressive perform ances 

from both the 

~- me n 's and ~ , I ': women's tea ms at the 
Cal Classic 

held at the Berkelcy Aquatic Park 
lasl week. 

While Arizona State domi-
nated both sides of the event. 
with Chico State taking second ,

Schneiderwind said. 

Molly Rice, Julie McLeery , 
Bec ky Blankinship and new-

In the world of Division III

gets. That is because Kenyon

care to count. Going into this 
season's championships, held on 
March 14-16 in Atlanta, Ga., 
UCSD Head Coach Doug Boyd 

was aiming for the top, or as close as 
anyone could come. 

"I expected to get econd," Boyd 
explained. "I would have been disap· 
pointed if we didn't." 

With that kind of pressure, the 
Tritons may have buckled; but in· 
stead, they came up with the best 
third·day morning in the coach's 
memory to lock up second place.

Tritons Make It A Habit, Come Back to Win Twice 
COMEBACK TRAIL: The Tritons notched two, one-run victories, coming back from 6-0 and 3-0 deficits to improve to 8-13-1 
By Sean Rahlml 
Associate Sports Editor 

... II has been said that the team 
which scores first in a baseball game 
usually comes out on top. So when 

the Sage hens from 
Pomona· Pitzer took a 
3-0 lead in the top of 
the first inning against 
the struggling Tritons 
last Tuesday, the 
crowd began to pre· 

oIClAlrDlliII. pare itself for yet an· 
other defeat. But 

UCSD showed heart in a 4-3 come· 
back victory behind the great pitch· 
ing perfonnance of Mike Bryant. 

UCSD did it again last night, 
corning back from a 6-0 deficit to 
defeat Concordia 7-6 in Irvine. The 
Tritons have now won two in·a-
row and three out of their last four. 

Raising their record to 7-13-1. 
the Tritons treated the home crowd 

at Triton Baseball Stadium to a rare 
sight on Tuesday afternoon: a vic· 
tory. Senior left· hander Bryant gave 
up a first·inning three·run home run 
to Sagchen designated·hi(Jer Jarrod 
Kula, but sett led down to blank 
Pomona the rest of the day. 

Bryant gave up only three hit 
and went the entire nine innings to 
piel' up a complete game and his 
fourth victory of the season. 

"The team is coming together 
and its great to be a part of it ," 
Bryant said. "It can never be one 
guy that does it. It has to be the 
whole team. I got great defensive 
support from the guys, and we 
came through." 

The Tritons scored a run in the 
fourth, fifth, eighth and ninth in· 
nings to take the contest, 4-3 . The 
La Jolla hardballers had IO hits, 
highlighted by two·hitgames from 
catcher Gilbert Benitez, senior 

center fielder Jason Aguilar and 
hortstop Mark Mason. All three 

also drove in a run apiece. 
With the game tied at three in 

the bottom of the ninth , first· 
baseman Chris Rondestvedt 
doubled, putting the winning run 
on second base. Benitez followed

Tuesday's sacrifice with another

over to third base. Third·baseman 
Chuck Jo~nson came through with 
the clutch hit for the Tritons, sin·

win the game. 

"We've been coming through 
in the clutch the last couple of 
games," Johnson said. "Coach 
Fletcher told us to forget the first 
half and play with a fresh start. 
Since then, we've been playing 
with confidence." 

Against Concordia. UCSD fell 
behind 6-0, and looked doomed to 
lose another game on the road. The 
Tritons relievers, however, stopped 
the bleeding and kept the game close. 
Junior David Mullin and Senior reo 
liever John Titchen kept the lid 
closed in the middle innings. 

The offense took the reins there· 
after and scored six runs in the

seventh inning to tie the game. In 
the top of the ninth inning, 
Rondestvedt came through in the 
clutch again , starting the ninth with 
a double down the right·field line. 

Like before, Benitez bunted him 
over to third. Jon Goldsmith came 
through for UCSD with a sacrifice fly 
to knock in the go·ahead run. 

"This game showed two 
things," Triton Head Coach Rob· 
ert Fletcher said. "It showed that 
Tuesday's game was not a fluke, 
and that we cold do it twice in a 
week. We need the young guys 
[Rondestvedt, Goldsmith, and Ma· 
son] to come through for us. I 
think the break helped us out in . 

Goldsmith provided some of· 
fense with a two-run double in the 
all·important seventh inning . 
Mason's ground ball brought in 
two more runs, as UCSD make its 
comeback complete.
