transplant, 35-year-old Sandra 
Jenson was released Friday 
from the Stanford University 
Medical Center. The Stanford

Since World War n, classified 
research into biological and nuclear 
weapons at the UC-managed labs 
has fueled heated criticism from 
everal UC faculty members who 

believe the univer ity should not 
participate in weapon research. 

"'The labs are really not part of 
the university'S identity," UCSD 
Associate Professor of History John 
Marino said. 

A pecial meeting of UCSD's 
Representative Assembly of the 
Academic Senate discussed Tues-
day the University of California's 
future involvement in the manage-
ment of several Department of En-
ergy laboratories. The meeting cul-

A.S. Debates Proposal to Increase Passing 
Time Between Classes to 15 Minutes 
MEETING: Council also 
discusses acquiring additional 
space in Price Center 
By Laura Lamb 
Staff Writer 

A.S. Council members discussed a proposal to 
increase the passing time between classes from 10 
to 15 minutes, as well as the possibility of acquir-
ing space on the second floor of the Price Center 
for an A.S.-supported business, at last night's 
council meeting. 

The council will decide next week whether to 
support the 15-minute passing time, and, if ap-
proved, will pass a formal resolution in support of 
it to the Academic Senate. The senate will make a 
final decision on the propo al later this quarter. 

Marshall Sophomore Senator Andrea Santos 
opposed the increa e, citing the I sue of safety for 

students leaving clas es at a later hour. 
"I know a lot of people who don ' t want to have 

c1as es in the evening [to avoid] walking home by 
themselves," she said. 

Muir Junior Senator Tony Fiori supported the 
increase and said he felt safety should not be a 
major concern because there are generally more 
than enough hours of daylight during the school 
year. 

''The winter quarter would be the only issue ... 
[but] there are CSOs," he said. 

Revelle Sophomore Senator David Fitzgerald 
also supported the increased passing time, citing 
his personal experiences rushing between classes 
or arriving late after attempting to speak with 
professors. 

"That extra time people do need to talk to T As 
or the teachc;r," he added.

Students Test 
New 'FreeSet' 
Telephones 
EXPERIMENT: Cellular-
type phone utilize new, 
wirele S technology 
By Meera Pal 
Staff Writer 

In the lates! effort to move UCSD onto the 
information superhighway, UCSD's Admin-
istrati ve Computing and Telecommunications 
(A.C.T.) department thi quarter gave special 
wireless telephones - called "freesets" - to 
a elect group of campus residents. 

The pilot program, which began April I, is 
intended to increlSe students' communica-
tions capability and personal safety. 

' 'The handsets increase student mobility 
and safety factors," AC.T. Assistant Director 
of Customer Service Ann Hanson said. "A 
freeset in [your1 pocket gives [you] an extra 
sense of security ." 

Muir College's Tioga Hall was chosen as 
the program's first test site. Muir Resident 
Dean Pat Danylyshyn-Adams said the rcsI-
dential hall was elected becau e of the im-
mense amount of concrete III the building. 

"IA.C.T.1 probably figured that ifit works 
here, it can work anywhere," Danylyshyn-
Adams said. 

AC.T. selected approximately 75 students 
and 25 residential-life staff members lastquar-
ter to participate in the program. The phones 
were distributed on April I, on the condition 
that participants would cooperate fully with 
any AC.T. surveys and que tions. 

'The hand cts weigh no more than 7.5 
ounces, measure 6.25 inches by 2.25 inches 
and operate on a 1,900 MHz frequency. 

AC.T. and UCSD Housing and Dining 
Services joined with MCI and Erics on for the 
program, which allow participants to use the 
phones at no cost to them. 

"We currently use Ericsson telephone 
switchesoncampus . .. andhaveUCSD' long-
distance services through Mel," Hanson aid. 
"It was only natural we tum to those vendors 
for support."

In response to student privacy

While administrators, includ-

required to imple-

agreed to put the 
new system into 
place within three

According to

students will be

reached an agreement with the 
Regi strar 's Office to alter the stu-

time, the A.S. submitted a Stu-

to "discontinue the current policy

as Personal Identification num-

protects the privacy rights of all 
university students against the 
potential misuse of Social Secu-

the A.S. proposal Slated that 
the use of Social Security num-

opportunities for fraudulent use. 
In particular, the proposal cited

Fourth Circuit'S decision in

stated: "There are compelling

During the first two weeks of 
Fall Quarter, there will be a two-

will be issued new campus ID 
cards. 

Backer said the One Card Com-
mittee, which will attempt to 
implement the new ID-card sys-
tem this summer, has yet to deter-
mine who will pick up the tab for 
issuing the cards . 

"I agree with students for all 
the reasons they wanted [the new 
identification system]," Backer 
said. "Obviously, with the explO-
sive growth of computer technol-
ogy, students have the right to 
ensure their privacy, and this is 
one way of doing that."

COUNCIL: 
A_S_ will decide 
position next week 
Continued from pege 1 
because many professors support 
the proposal, the council must act 
soon if it hopes to negatively influ-
ence the senate. 

"It's so critical now that we act 
on this ," Sabatini said. 

Sabatini also urged 
councilmembers to discuss the is-
sue with their college councils and 
ask other students for their input. 

In an informal poll, the council 
opposed the proposal 4-20, with 4 
members abstaining. The council 
will take a formal vote to determine 
its position next week. 

In other business, the council 
addressed the possibility of acquir-
ing space on the second floor of the 
Price Center, which currently houses 
part of the game room. 

Commissioner of Operations/ 
Serv i ces and Enterpri ses Eri n Ho I ve 
introduced the possibility to the 

council, explaining the need to 
present a "solid plan" to University 
Centers Director Jim Carruthers. 
Carruthers would then present the 
proposal to the University Centers 
Advisory Board (UCAB), which 
would make a final decision. 

Holve expressed her hope for 
A.S. involvement and suggestions 
in the process. She attempted to 
address the problems the counci I 
and the university had with Assorted 
Vinyl , but said shestill felt thecoun-
ci I had "the potential for a great 
idea." 

Muir Senator lustin Farar sup-
ported acquiring the space and sug-
gested establishing a video store. 
Fararalso urged councilmembers to 
focus on the interests of freshmen 
and sophomores. 

" A lot of [those) people don ' t 
have cars, which limits their access 
to businesses," Farar said. " I think 
we also need to think about what 's 
financially feasible, too." 

Commissioncr of Communica-
tions James Fabionardisagreed with 
Farar's emphasis on only freshman 

The UCSD Guardian 

and sophomore students. Fabionar 
cited the wide variety of students 
who tend to frequent the Price Cen-
ter, "not necessarily just first and 
second-year students." 

Holve reminded the council that 
the acquisition is tentative at best. 

"It 's not our space, and ... we 
need to come up with a solid enough 
proposal, in fact, a business plan ... 
so that [the university] will be will -
ing to make modifications," she said. 

In another informal vote, the 
counci I supported using the space 
for a hair-cutting facility. 

The council will make a formal 
decision within the next two weeks. 
If approved, a proposal will be pre-
sented to UCAB by the end of Spri ng 
Quarter. 

In other news, the executive of-
fi cers and commissioners briefed 
new council members on their func-
tions within the council. The A.S. 
will return next week with proposed 
goals for the coming year. 

"We need to address issues now 
so we don' t lose time," Sabatini 
said. "We have a 101. .• to discuss."

Students Should Not Stand 
For Mobil'. Price Gouging 

It's bad enough that across the country, gas prices have risen 
meteorically. It's worse that most San Diego drivers have to pay 
about $1.50 for regular unleaded gas when the national average is 
$1.27. But it's simply sickening that the Mobil station on La Jolla 
Village Drive is charging $1.71 for regular unleaded. 

Over at Costa Verde shopping center, Shell charges about 
$1.55, while down Torrey Pines Road, Chevron charges $1.54. 
And those are "high" prices when compared to other gas stations. 
For instance, Pacific Beach stations are currently charging 
anywhere from $1.48 to $1.52. 

So, how does Mobil get away with this price gouging? After 
all, any other business - with the exception of Ralph 's - would 
have 'been economically crucified by such blatant overpricing. 
Perhaps Mobil's proximity to UCSD, and the fact that UCSD is a 
commuter school, explains its success. 

Whatever the case, the first precept of capitalism dictates that 
the consumer shall decide which businesses succeed and which 
fail. As long as studcnts continue 10 frequent Mobil , the station 
will never have cause to lower its prices. However, if students 
join together to boycoll this establishment, Mobil will experience 
an economic disaster. How long can Mobil keep up its exorbitant 
pricing if the majority of its customers no longer bring it busi-
ness? 

At a time when the cost of gas is out of control, we shouldn't 
allow t.1obilto get away with such profiteering. Mobil is insult-
ing students' intelligence, as well as their. wallets. 

Private Rally Should Have 
Been Privately Funded 

Two weeks ago, a group of students wrote to the Guardian 
about a March 12 pro-affirmativc action rally in which they 
"were not allowed to speak" because they did not agree with the 
views presented at the rally. Although these students were denied 
access to the microphone, no one physically prevented them from 
exercising their First Amendment right to free speech. Had they 
wanted to, they could have - among other things - climbed on 
top of tables in the center of the plaza and shouted whatever they 
wanted, perhaps as part of their own protest. 

Inlfued, denying these anti-affirmative action allendees a place 
in front of the microphone - considering they did not have a 
hand in organizing the event and failed to realize there was a 
designated speakers list until it was too late - is remotely 
understandable. And it's certainly not the same as denying the 
students' rights to speak their minds. 

But another point brought up by the students' letter is much 
more troublesome. That is, the issue of funding the pro-affirma-
tive action event. Why is student fee money used tp support a 
gathering that is not only highly political in nature, but also one 
that does not expressly encourage the airing of both sides of an 
explosive issue like affirmative action? Why is fee money from 
every student on this campus used for an event which is inten-
tionally planned to be exclusionary? The event was clearly one-
sided, from its inception to its fruition. (It's not like organizers 
advertised for opposing points of view to sign up for the speakers 
list.) 

Jf the pro-affirmative action rally were a private event - such 
as a Democratic party for Bill Clinton - then it would be 
privately funded. just as a Clinton event would be paid for by the 
Democratic National Committee and other friends of the presi-
dent. No one would deny the right of a private group to stage its 
own rally to speak its mind. However, students who do not agree 
with the goals of the publically funded March 12 rally should not 
be forced to foot the bill. especially when they aren't even given 
the chance - from the very beginning - to haye a say. 

Thumbs Up to the

Ah, yes, the beauti fu I 
sounds of spring: students 
learning, absorbing knowl-

philosophical dilemmas in 
the hallow ed hall s of 
academia. 

Indeed, it's midterm time,

I enter the library shortly after 
noon, leaving about six hours of 
stud~ing before dinner. Surely r can 
finish my studying in this time .... Af-
ter wandering around the bottom two 
floors looking for an open table, I get 
nothing. Every table is occupied by 
roughly one person whose belong-
ings are spread out just enough to 
deter anyone from sitling there. 
(Heaven forbid someone should 
study six whole feet away from 
them.)

I figure a drink of water will re-
lax me and provide me with some 
fuel for the long day of studying 
ahead. On the way over, though, I 
spot a buddy of mine playing around 
on the Internet. I'll just stop by and 
say hello for a minute or two. Half 
an hour later. I walk back to my table 
to get down to some serious study-
ing. Glancing at my watch, I see I' ve 
still got about four-and-a-half solid 
hours of studying left. No problem. 

As I sit down in my chair, I no-
tice a group of four students, all 
sprawled out over a table , two of 
them drooling, one of them snoring 
and the other one buried under his 
backpack. How odd - only three of 
them were asleep when I left. One of 
them suddenly jolts awake and 
quickly looks around to make sure no 
one saw him. Then he readjusts, 
grabs his backpack and puts it under 
his head for a pillow, and immedi-
ately goes back to sleep. 

Finally, I find a vacant table and 
rush toward it, quickly scattering my books around 
so nobody will sit down with me. Naturally, I've 
brought practically every book I own - for some 
reason, I always think I'll get far more done than I 
ever do. Even after years and years of deluding 
myself, I still overestimate my own efficiency when 
it comes to studying. Has anyone ever finished 
studying all the material he brought with him? 

For the first I ~ minutes, I lean back in my chair, 
observing my surroundings and getting comfonable. 

To my right, one student has his 
feet up on the table with the Los Angeles TImes spons 
section spread out on his legs. Across from him, his 
friend debates with him who is going to win the NBA 
championship. A few minutes later, he is trying to 
guess the records of all the teams in the American 
League East. He insists that the Red Sox can't re-
ally be in founh place. 

To my left, a well-built jock is trying to pick up 
on some poor girl who's actually trying to study.

COMMENTARY: While most vegetarians cite health and ethical reasons for giving up meat, consuming dairy 
products is far more unhealthy and far more cruel to animals 

'VEGETARIAN' DIET IS AND UNHEALTHY 
By Adem Linson 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

"There's no way I would ever 
eat meal! Meat is horrible for your 
health and inhumane to animals. 
But drinking milk and eating 
cheese - I do that all the time." 

Sound familiar? Aside from 
the fact that humans are the only 
mammals that drink milk beyond 
infancy and from another species, 
there is abundant evidence thai 
cow milk is neither nourishing nor 
benign to humans. 

Some ailments encouraged by 
the consumption of dairy products 
include hardening of the arteries, 
ovarian cancer, cataracts, diabetes, 
multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid ar-
thritis and asthma. In addition, if 
you, out of concern for animal 
rights, abstain from meat-eating 
but not from dairy consumption, 
you are sadly mistaken about 
which process causes more pain to 
animals. 

The current "health food" 
trend is largely based on misinfor-
mation. Those who succumb to the 
pressures of the "health food" in-
dustry don't realize thai they can 

improve their bodies through sim-
pler and more natural means than 
strange diets and low-ca lorie 
foods. Health-conscious people 
may realize the benefits of avoid-
ing meat, but they are seldom 
aware of the damage to their bod-
ies caused by dairy products. 

Those who consume dairy 
products daily often have no idea 
that headaches, bloating, stuffy 
noses, eczema (a skin condition), 
hives, restlessness and cramps are 
all symptoms of an allergy to milk 
protein, which can be found even 
in lactose-free foods. Millions of 
Americans are allergic to milk 
protein, but are unaware this al-
lergy exists. . 

Often, they dismis their symp-
toms as being caused by other 
sources - and then further upset 
their system's balance by treating 
the symptoms with inappropriate 
over-the-counter medications. In 
addition, the pesticide, hormone 
and antibiotic residues found in 
dairy products impair the human 
immune system, making the body 
more prone to illness. Simply cut-
ting dairy products out of your diet

will eliminate these symptoms and 
allow your immune system to get 
back to normal. 

But how can one get the pro-
tein and calcium the body needs 
without consumiRg meat or dairy 
products? For one thing, protein 
is extremely overrated. The aver-
age American eats many times the 
amount of protein his body needs 
on a daily basis - injust one hour. 
The natural proteins found in non-
animal products are more than ad-
equate to meet your body's needed 
dosage as long as you eat a well-
balanced diet. 

Consuming excess protein will 
actually diminish calcium within 
the body. Some evidence has 
shown that drinking milk can even 
weaken your bones, and increase 
your risk of osteoporosis. Cows 
get their calcium from leafy green 
vegetation - a far beller source 
of calcium than milk . 
Osteoporosis is rare in countries 
where little or no animal products 
are consumed. 

Concerning the ethical treat-
ment of animals, few are unfamil-
iar with th e meal -packing 
industry's lack of compassion for 
cows ;mel other livestock. But few 
know of the miserable lives dairy 

cows endure. If you stopped eat-
ing meat out of compassion for 
animals, but you still consume 
dairy products, you are only fight-
ing half the battle. 

Bovine Growth Hormone 
(BGH) is administered to dairy 
cows to stimulate milk production. 
This hormone makes cows even 
more susceptible 10 the infections 
and diseases that spread quickly in 
their overcrowded living condi-
tions. The cows must be given 
food laced with antibiotics to keep 
them alive and functioning like 
machines. 

All of these contaminant com-
bine to make the factory farm run, 
but the end result is pollution of 
the water supply. The cattle indus-
try is the largest source of water 
co ntamination in the Uniled 
States, surpassing even chemical 
factories and paper mill s. 

Dairy cows must be milked 10 
months of the year to produce 
enough milk to meet demand. To 
keep their mammary glands func-
tioning for that period qf time (10 
times the natural level), the cows

That sentence sounds vaguely fa-
miliar. 

At about this point, it's time for 
the inevitable rationalization: "I 
don't really need to study that 
much. After all, I already know it 
prelty well. Even so, whal if I do 
poorly? In the long run, it won't 
matter that much . I can afford to 
go through this material quickly." 
And so I do just that. I race 
through one book, then another,

bined with the physical tortures en-

Such intense thought leads me 
away from my notes to the books 
on the shelves in front of me: ''The 
Interdynamics of Material Growth 
Versus Natural Metamorphosis." 
Are you kidding me? Somebody ac-
tually wrote this book, and others 
have actually read it. This library 
must be wasting a lot of shelf space 
if it's got books like this. 

As I scan the shelves for a bet-
ter book, I spot something remark-
able in the distance: a student 
studying. Yes, hidden there in a 
dark corner of the basement of the 
UCSD library, a young woman sits 
by herself, engrossed in a book, 
brow furrowed in deep thought. 
Could this actually be? Alas, she 
lifts up her book to change posi-
tions, displaying the cover of this 

and avoid milk products. 
The switch to an animal-free 

diet is difficult. Take your time, 
and gradually phase out different 
foods one by one. Rarely do 
people who try to quit all animal 
products at once continue to mai n· 
tain their new healthy and cruelty-
free diet. Many companies make 
excellent substitutes for dairy as 
well as meat products.

Leaning back in my chair, I be-

college education and examina-

Yes, the Geisel library - a bas-

one hour left before dinner, I shake 
my head and get back to work :

Skateboarder Killed in Tragic Fall NEW PATIENT SPECIAL! 
ACCIDENT: Warren 
student crashes from 
skateboard on hill 
By GrKe J_ng 
Staff Writer 

Gary Paul Tillman, a Warren 
ophomore described by his friends 

as "carefree and outgoing," died 
Monday night from head injuries 
suffered during a skateboarding ac-
cident on campus. He was 20 years 
old. 

According to witnesses, Tillman 
and (wo of his friends were skate-
boarding down a dimly lit, asphalt 
incJineeast of Peterson Hall at 12:30 
a.m. Monday morning, when 
Tillman's skateboard swerved too 
faron a right turn and stuck in dirt -
sending him head· first into the pave-
ment. 

UCSD Deteclive Robert Jones 
said Tillman was unconscious when 
police arrived althe scene. Tillman 
was immediately taken by ambu-
lance to Scripps Memorial Hospi-
tal, where he was kept alive on life 
support until Monday evening. He 
was pronounced dead at 9:30 p.m. 

from massive inlemal head injuries. 
"Gary was an avid skateboarder, 

and I'm sure he's fallen several times 
before," Jones said. "But this time, 
he just fell wrong." 

Family and friends remember 
Tillman most for his love of life. 

"Gary lived life to the fullest," 
his mother, Marlene Tillman, said. 
"Thati n' tto sayhewasadaredevil 
- he just enjoyed everything in 
life." 

Tillman enjoyed music , 
snowboarding, waterskiing and 
playing football and softball. He 
was an engineering major and had 
planned to intern in a lab this spring. 
According to his mother, her son -
who lived in Indio, Calif. before 
enrolling at UCSD - loved school 
and had planned to make San Diego 
his home. 

"Gary had many dreams," she 
said. "He loved people; he loved 
life. He was the most well-liked 
person I have ever known." 

Friends described Tillman as 
amiable and carefree. 

"He was really sweet," Warren 
junior Sonu Wasu said. "He always 
had a smile on his face. Before the

Tillman is survived by his father, 
Gary Tillman; his mother, Marlene 
Tillman; and his 23-year-old sister, 
Kerri Tillman, all of whom reside in 
Indio. 

"Gary and his sister had a special 
bond," Marlene said. "Gary was our 
pride and joy." 

Interim Chancellor Marjorie 
Caserio expressed her sympathies 
for the family on behalf of faculty 
and administration at UCSD. 

"'am deeply saddened byGary 's 
tragic death," Case rio said. "I grieve 
for his family at their loss. On behalf 
of the entire campus, I extend deep-
est sympathy to his family, and to 
his many colleagues and friends ."

its current West Coast tour with Japanese hip-hop/punk. female duo

Babe's hodge-podge style of blues, funk, thrashy guitar, sweet

The Pallbearer 
Schwimmer, 'of 'Friends' fame, 
ventures to big-screen comedy 

By Carol Shum 
Guardian Reporter 

Although The Pallbearer is 
advenised as a romantic 
comedy, you won ' t find 
yourself laughing very 
hard at this '90s version 
of The Graduate.-
Instead, you will receive 
an unexpected, hefty 
dose of reality. 

David Schwimmer, of 
TV's "Friends," plays 
Tom Thompson, an unemployed 
architect who still lives with his 
mother (Carol Kane). The film 
begins with Thompson being asked 
to be a pallbearer at the funeral of a 
high school classmate - one 
whom he doesn' t remember . 

From there things get compli-
cated, as Thompson finds himself 
tangled up in a bizarre love triangle 

Thurs. May 16 

between the deceased's mother 
(Barbara Hershey) and an old high 
school classmate (Gwyneth Pal-

trow), who doesn ' t 
remember him. 

Schwimmer's pouty, 
puppy-dog innocence 
slowly channs his audi-
ence, in much the same 
way Dustin Hoffman did 
in The Graduate. The 
supporting cast adds con-
sistency to the film's 

twists and subplots. 
The film exudes wannth and 

optimism in its portrayal of~om. a 
lonely soul in a cruel and horrible 
world who manages to shuffle 
through the challenges of day-to-
day life. 

The Pallbearer is currently 
playing in theaters throughout San 
Diego.

York band plays 
West Coast tour 
Continued from page H9 

I think this record is a little 
more direct and also, well ... J guess 
you could say fat-free, maybe. We 
took a lot of songs that were edited 
and tried not to have anything gra-
tuitou . Our other records had 
things that were really wonky and 
self-conscious. Our first record was 
very struggling. The way that 
we've evolved is a really hard thing 
to describe to the outside. When I 
listen to the first album now, I'm 
just surprised about it, because it 
came about in a sl(ange way 
Did you set more time to 
work out the sonp record-
inc on • ngjor ........... on 
HoIMste.d Record.? 

Oh yes. The writing of the songs 
is the same as it's been. They ' re 
written before tours or while we're 
on tour. Every once in a while 
we're kind of walking on a tight 
rope, perfonning new songs while 
we're touring, even if we're not 
really ready to do them live. The 
thing with RCA that made a huge 
difference was that it gave us a lot 
of time to record. What the whole 
"major label" difference comes 
down to two things - you get 
more time, and you'll find your 
record in stores.

The Day the Needles Stood Still 
AIIImItIn TuIIel" 

-**** 

The Great White Hype Due to the success of Bahama-dia's 1994 single, "Tolal Wreck," there has been huge anticipation surrounding the release of her fir t, 
full -length album, entitled ~ollage. 
With a jazz-based, smoot~ deliv-
ery, she impresses with an original 
style encapsulated in the numerous 
tight tracks. 

lelia Biafra, lead singer of the 
'SOs hyper-polititaJ hardcore band 
the Dead Kennedys, has a well-
earned reputation for his outspoken 
diatribes that challenge the bound-
aries of the status quo and free 
speech. Characters box for millions in new comedy 

These standards of excellence 
trickle down to the records issued 
by his label, Alternative Tentacles. 
The Day the Needle Stood Still, a 
compilation of vinyl EPs released 
last year, is a shining example. 

ByS .. n ...... mI 
Senior Staff miter 

The formula sounds like it 
could work: Sign up a 
plethora of accom-
plished comedic actors, 
add an interesting plot 
twist and crank out a 
hilarious movie. ]t can 't 
get any easier, right? 
Wrong. 

The' Great White 
Hype, starring Samuel 
L. Jackson and Damon Wayans, 
shows promise but falls well short 
of expectations. The film looks at 
the outrageous world of profes-

sional boxing through the eyes of 
the Reverend Fred Sultan (Jack-
son) and his heavyweight champi-

on, James ''The Grim 
Reaper" Roper 
(Wayans). 

As a namboyant pro-
moter and a consum-
mate con-man, Rev-
erend Sultan is sur-
rounded by a star-stud-
ded cast of characters. 
Julio Escobar (Cheech 

Marin) is the corrupt boxing cor-
poration president who greases 
and bends the rules for Sultan and 
his public-relations guru, Mitchell 

Krane (Jeff Goldblum). 
Directed by Reginald Hudlin, 

the film is ultimately in dire need 
of a tune up. It sputters along, as 
the characters drag the sporadic 
script through an hour and a half 
of pure stupidity. Either Jackson, 
who has too few lines, and Foxx, 
whose original style of comedy is 
not well utilized, would have been 
a good choice for this central char-
acter. 

In the end, don't believe all the 
hype - nothing could save this 
movie. 

The Great White Hype is play-
ing in theaters around San Diego. 

Bahamadia's versatility can be 
seen in the various themes she 
explores in her songs. The strength 
of this album lies in the collabora-
tions between Bahamadia and 
other artists, such as the Roots on 
"Da Jawn" and several artists on "3 
Tha Hard Way." Songs such as 
these, as well as "Total Wreck" and 
"UKNOWHOWWEDO," truly 
show extent of her talent. 

Despite minor drawbacks, this 
album has several solid tracks and 
should prove Bahamadia to be one 
of the foremost MC's in hip hop. 

-Gabe Monts 

The collection features six 
bands with regional followings but 
little national attention. All the 
bands on the record put in their 
share of 'light, aggressive and 
intense guitar thrash. The compila-
tion will be a boon for the punk 
rock fans who are yearning for 
fresh listening material but don ' t 
have the money or time to spend in 
record shops searching for it.

Dancing its way into the 
Lyceum Theatre this 
week, "Black Choreogra-
phers Moving" (BCM) is 
a showcase of three 
African-American dance 
companies from across 
the country. 

Presented by Sushi, a 
San Diego-based altema-
tive-performance and 
visual-ans forum, BCM features 
innovative contemporary dancers 
who use dance as a means of 
expres ' ing provocative, real-life 
issues. This weekend's perfor-
mance marks the fourth presenta-
tion of the festival in San Diego. 

Harris will also present "Endan-
gered Species," a solo work draw-
ing on his experiences as an

African-American male. This piece 
incorporates a narrative monologue 
with dance movements, resulting in 

a powerful exchange 
between Harris and the 
audience. 

Founded in 1994, 
Johnson's company takes 
its stylistic influence 
from traditional ballet, 
transforming it into con-
temporary movement. 

"BCM is a celebra-
tion of African-American contem-
porary dance. Many people arc nol

work bcing done" said Vicki Woll .

BLUE OX: 
Band on tour with 
Cibo Matto 
Continued from page H10 
it? 
small clubs, so we feel like a home-
town band everywhere we go. 
How'. the reception' to Peo-
pie been? 

Well, people tell us they like it. 
I personally love that record; I'm 
so happy with it, and most people 
are just going to tell us what they 
like on it. It is a record that for me, 
r we didn '( want to include anything 
we were working on that was too 
rough], so we ended up cutting out 
a 101 of stuff. For us, it's just a great 
record lO lislen to. Some people are 
surpri sed with the softer songs, and 
Tim plays some folky types of 
songs on acoustic guitar. 
Do people usually expect a 
harder or weirder sound 
from you, &fven your past 
......... 1 

Oh yes. In fact, one interviewer 
who we've known for a long time 
lold us that he thought someone 
had sent over the wrong record. 
But he also said he liked it. 
What's the new video to 
" Stand By Your Man" 
about? 

The song's about religion, and 
we wanted to make sure that 's in 
the video because it sounds like a 
love song, So the whole thing kind 
of ends up coming about like noth· 
ing. The whole song's a "you've 
been there" kind of thing, a ques-
lioning of, God. The video uses all 
kinds of different an, and it's sup· 
posed lO look like a 3·0 religious 
postcard, with lots of flipping 
images. It doesn't have a plot nec-
essarily, it's just supposed to look 
like a really strange dream. 
What's the next video 
you're working on? 

We're probably doing a video 
for "Can' l Sland Up," and we'll 
probably be going around on chop· 
per bikes. Making videos is jusl a 
weird, awkward thing, with a 
whole crew and camera that you 
don 'I really need, and you lipsync· 
ing with all Ihose people there. 
Now when I watch videos, I realize 
the awkwardness . 
How do you like touring 
with Cibo Matto? 

San Diego 's one of our first 
shows with them. They.are incredi-
bly nice people, wh ich is greal 
because we usually gel booked wilh 
lots of hard bands - which is fine, 
but when you're all playing togeth-
er and iI'S cold [outside], it just gets 
hard. Their music is really pretty 
and real ly fun to walch, ilnd it 's just 
great when we really like the peo-
ple, We only played with them in 
]ndianapolis and in New York a 
long time ago. We 're just really 
excited about playing with them.

SENIORS: Two 
will remain at UCSD 
ContInued front ..... 20 
NAJA schools like The Master's Col-
lege, as well as a few Division D 
squads from the likes ofUe Riverside 
and Cal-Poly Pomona, which splin-
teredtheTritons' hopesofrunningoff 
some long winning streaks. 

UCSD was led by the talents of 
junior center Man Aune. 1be team's 
Most Valuable Player led all Tritons 
in scoring and rebounding, with a 
19.8 points·per-game average to go 
with his 10 boards a game, 

While Aune was the focal point of 
the offense, the team's future success 
will rely heavily on the developmcnt 
of the freshman corps of point guard 
Adam Libby and forwards Mike 
Thimgan and Mike Wall. 

'The best thing about freshmen is 
that they become sophomorcs," 
Lanthier said. 

While the Tritons' freshmen will 
be running·and-gunning for years to 
come, the UCSD squad had to say 
farewell to three departing seniors. 

"Seniors are the backbone of your 
program," Lanthier said. "They're the 
ones who keep the continuity going." 

Although they will be missed by 
the Triton coaching staff, these ath-
letes shou Id still be seen around the La 
Jolla campus. 

Power forward Man Minehan, a 
two-sport athlete for the Tritons, will 
finish his UCSDcareernext year when 
he lakes to the hardwood for his final 
volleyball campaign. 

"Minehan is a very good athlete," 
Lanthier said of the 6'4" co-captain, 
"Although he was a very quiet leader, 
Man was a very physical presence on 
our team. I know the players all re-

Thursday, May ~, 1996 
spected his wort dhic," 

Guard David Dillon finished up 
his last year of collegiate eligibility 
playing for his mentor, Lanthier, who 
first coached Dillon as a freshman at 
Vista High School, Dillon will re-
main a Triton, following his passion 
for the game by joining the coaching 
ranks at UCSD. 

"Dave loves basketball," Lanthier 
said, of his future assistant. "He 
worked extremely hard toget to wherc 
he is now, I think that he'll have a lot 
of say into what needs to be laUght." 

Guard Nick "Money" Bertino, 
aptly named because of his 46-per-
cent field-goal shooting this season, 
leaves the Tritons after four years of 
service on the UCSD squad, Bertino 
garnered the team's Most Inspira-
tional Player Award for his persis-
tence anddetennination in the face of 
a career-threatening injury, 

'" have a lot of respect for 
[Bertino]," Lanthier said. "He has a 
very good outlook on life." 

Bertino came back late in the 
'95-'96 season after rehabilitating 
an anterior cruciate ligament in· 
jury, TheS'J I"shooterspentmuch 
of the summer and the early portion 
of the school year preparing for his 
inspiring role in the Tritons' youth 
movement. 

"] wish that Nick could have 
been with us for the whole year," 
Lanthier said. "He was the most 
inspirational player, and very 
deservingly so," 

While UCSD has lost the ser-
vices of these three seniors, the Tri-
tons hope that the added home dates, 
the. extra year of experience and 
growth, along with an increased fa-
miliarity with Lanthier's coaching 
philosophy, will amount to more 
wins next season,

the UCSD women's squad was its

Paint Me Red & 
Call Me Crazy 

I've never wanted to be an 
Italian so badly in my life. 

Let me explain. 
It has been two months since 

my introduction to midnight 
soccer on Prime Sports. An hour 
of English soccer begins at 
10:30 p.m., followed by an hour 
of those swarthy Italians kicking 
about the field. My brief, near-
sleep experiences with the 
world' most popular has taught 
me two things: First. soccer can 
be fun to watch; and second, 
ooooohhh my, are those 
European fans crazy. 

Those folks are borderline 
insane - I take it back; they' re 
way over the border. They've 

',' got passports in hand, bags over 
their shoulders and their 
hitchhiking thumbs wagging in 
the wind. Honestly, most 
European soccer fans hould be 
confined to institutions with 
names like Shady Acres or 
BelJview Hills, places where 
men and women in neatly 
pressed white uniforms scurry 
about the grounds in pursuit of 
wayward, pajama-clad patients. 

This being said, let it be 
known that I would like to gel 
my passport as soon as poSSIble. 
That's right, I'm proclaiming to 

I-- the world my desire 10 become a 
European soccer freak . A person 
for whom the name "God" 
conjures visions of the local 
club's leading scorer, and the 
color of that same leam hold a 
significance along the lines of 
which red and blue hold in South 

• Central L.A. 
Why? Simply because it 's 

fun to be freaky. I want to go to 
games ojad in the leam jersey, 
wearing broad streaks of paint 
across 90 percent of my body 
and yell until I'm hoarse. Thi 
just isn:t done in America, and 
frankly, I'm disappointed. Sure, 
there's the occasional fan of 
overwhClrning valor who dares 
to enter the stadium with a 
painted face and bullhorn in tow. 

But for the most part. the 
hefty price of tickets to sporting 
events in the U.S. has resulted 
in the majority of audiences 

- being middle-class folk who are 
too bent on not standing out. 
They cheer when a good play is 
made and celebrate when victory 
is achieved, but there is no 
comparison between their 
meager cheers and those of my 
fandom brethren in Europe. 

In soccer, goals are few are 
far between. However, from the 
stadium of a typical European 
game arises a constant din of 
roaring fans. Entire sections of 
the stadium are awash in the 
home colors. The production of 
a goal by the home team has 
been known to register on 
Richter scales uound the world. 

As a sports aficionado who 
has suffered through three years 
of fan impotency here at UCSD, 
I am eaaer to experience this 
atmosphere. This is why I would 
like to be an Italian .... That and 
the fICt that being swarthy is 
good for the '01 night life.

MARCIA JEFFRIES: "(She) was the ultimate role

worked hard, stepped up, and did what we needed." 

SEASON OF FIRSTS 
The 1995-96 season for the UCSD women's basketball 

leam was marked by buzzer-beating victories and record-
breaking achievemenls. Led by their lone senior and starting 
point guard, Marcia Jeffries, the Tritons defeated Pomona-
Pitzer for their first-ever victory in the Division ill National 
Tournament Although their season ended with a second-
round loss at the hands Sl. Thomas of Minnesota, the UCSD 
women proved that they could contend at the national level.

ATHELETES 
TWO TO REMAIN TRITONS 

The 1995-96 basketball season was a 
season of change and development for the 
Triton men. The high-scoring offen e made 
for some wild games, but the inexperience of 
young players and their unfamiliarity with a 
new system ultimately left UCSD frustrated. 

The root of the Tritons' woes was their 
inability to put opponents away. Theirswann-
ing defense and up-tempo offense kept them 
in most contests, but lapses in execution 
sometimes allowed late leads to slip away. 
While the Tritons did begin to play much 
better toward the end of the season, as the 

players and coaches began to gel, UCSD still 
finished under .500. The Tritons ended the 
year with a televised victory over UC Santa 
Cruz, which sweetened an otherwise biller, 
11 -14 season. 

"From a record standpoint; we were not 
as successful as we wanted to be," Triton 
Head Coach Greg Lanthier said. "But I think 
that we underestimated the difficulty of our 
schedule. In [Division 01] we were 11-5 and 
had a real opportunity to be IS-I."

7.3 points and four

will return to the court 
next year as a senior on

"Money" was the Most 
Inspirational Player for 
the Tritons this year. 
Bertino fought back from 
an ACl injury to appear 
in nine games, in which 
he cashed in on an even

attempts from three-
point land.
