Two state senators have joined 
forces last Wednesday to introduce an 
amendment that would remove the 
130-year-old statute that grants the 
University of California immunity 
from legislative control.

Senators Leland Yee (D–San 

Francisco/San Mateo) and Roy 
Ashburn (R– Bakersfield) drafted the 
proposal in response to a number of 
“egregious offenses” committed by 
the UC Board of Regents, according 
to Yee spokesman Adam Keigwin. 

Among these offenses were alleg-
edly unjust restrictions in the UC 
nonaffiliate speech policy, as well as 
the regents’ alleged lack of public 
accountability. 

Most notably, Keigwin cited 
“exorbitant pay hikes to top execu-
tives” amid an economic crisis and 
rising student fees as motivation for 
the proposal. 

If passed, Yee and Ashburn’s 
amendment would strip the regents 

of their autonomy, giving the state 
the ability to pass laws on issues such 
as salary increases and speech rights. 
However, Keigwin said, “nothing 
theoretically changes with day-to-day 
operations.” 

Keigwin pointed to the California 
State University system as an exam-
ple, which is subject to state laws but 
also has a board of trustees to hand 
down operational decisions.

The committee formed in Fall 
Quarter 2007 to revise and combine 
the UCSD speech and distribution-of-
literature policies held its final meeting 
last Wednesday. After arguing through 
a few details, its members declared 
the draft finished and ready for public 
release.

The new 
policy draft is at 
least three times 
the size of the 
two existing pol-
icies combined. 
Changes include 
an 11:30 a.m. to 
1:30 p.m. time 
slot in which the 
use of amplified 
electronic sound 
is restricted to 
an updated list 
of zones across 
campus, stream-
lined from the 
draft’s list of 
arbitrary slots 
two weeks ago 
but still cutting 
one half hour 
from the existing 
policy. The draft 
also establishes 
a volume limit of 90 decibels for any 
amplified sound; permission to use 
chalk as a form of expression on uni-
versity property, which is currently not 
allowed; and a preamble largely pre-
served from a speech-policy proposal 
created by students last fall.

“This speech policy is designed to 
be broad, flexible and to acknowledge 
the historic significance of free speech, 
while also preserving the research, 
teaching and public service mission of 
the university,” the preamble’s closing 
line reads.

At an emergency meeting three 
weeks ago, students and administrators 
on the committee agreed it was impor-
tant to release the draft immediately 
for public comment. Student repre-
sentatives said they thought it essential 
to open the public-input period while 
campus hype surrounding the com-
mittee was still active, fearing it might

The A.S. Council’s summer plans 
include re-examining its services via 
a student survey and researching both 
a possible broadcast tower for KSDT 
radio and an on-campus media center 
to serve student publications.

Vice President of Finances and 
Resources Peter Benesch said it’s 
unlikely the council will alter its cur-
rent budget for any particular service, 
but will use the student responses to 
assess the scale and necessity of any 
eventual changes. 

 “It’s good to evaluate and see what 
we’re doing and if we could do it bet-
ter,” Benesch said.

Apart from the survey, the council 
will consider investing in a broad-
casting tower for KSDT, which cur-
rently can only be streamed from the 
Internet. Benesch said increased fund-
ing could help KSDT apply for and 
construct a radio tower, though no 
definite plans will be laid out until he 
speaks with next year’s station manag-
ers.

KSDT Music Director Marcus 
Rosario said he first considered 
applying for a tower after register-
ing KSDT with the Intercollegiate 
Broadcasting System in 2007. He said 
KSDT needs approval from the UC 
Board of Regents before establish-
ing a broadcasting frequency, along 
with acceptance from the Federal 
Communications Commission and 
approximately $15,000 to construct 
the tower itself, requiring an over-18-
month process. 

KSDT has received over $8,600 
from the A.S. Council as a result of 
the A.S. fee referendum this year, in 

addition to its annual budget of $2,500, 
according to General Manager Ivan 
Dominguez. 

Rosario said KSDT will appoint a 
student to spearhead the application 
process next year. 

“There’s so much more to radio 
than just music,” Rosario said. “There 
are things like reaching out to commu-
nication majors and the whole com-

KSDT, UCSD’s fiercely independent college radio station, has broadcast exclusively on the Internet since 
1999. The A.S. Council will now look into aquiring a broadcast tower for the station.

student satisfaction with 
services like Safe Ride and 
holiday shuttle.

The Jacobs School of Engineering 
will dramatically alter its bioengi-
neering curriculum next year, cutting 
the pre-medical track and adding 10 
new student seats to both the bioen-
gineering and biotechnology tracks.

According to Bioengineering 
department Chair Shankar 
Subramaniam, many within the 
bioengineering department believe 
the pre-med track is currently too 
focused on pre-med requirements, 
and does not placing enough empha-
sis on upper-division engineering

UC spokesman Pete King said 
handing over such tight control to leg-
islators would endanger the univer-
sity’s academic freedom, and pointed 
out that the government already has a 
say in the regents’ actions.

“We go to them for our gen-
eral fund money, the governor 
appoints a majority of the board and 
Californians get a say in that if we’re 
not doing a good job they won’t come 
to our schools,” he said. 

According to King, government 
interference in day-to-day affairs 
could not only cause financially and 
administratively harmful delays, but 
might also jeopardize the university’s 
freedom to teach more controversial 
subjects.

The UC system, King said, is a 
large organization that is current-
ly maintaining a balanced budget, 
whereas the Legislature has “a job 
to do up there that’s big enough for 
them already.” 

The university’s current adminis-
trative immunity was enacted upon 
it’s foundation, when there was strong 
public support for the UC system 
to become a series of agricultural 
schools. 

The educational and legislative 
leaders at the time created an inde-
pendent board of regents that could, 
without worrying about answering 
to voters, design campuses with a 

broader focus. 
Keigwin acknowledged that 

“maybe [immunity] was the right 
decision for the time,” but said the 
institution should now be made 
accountable to the public.

At the regents’ meeting last May,  
board members proposed increasing 
chancellor salaries at UC Davis and 
UC San Francisco to above $400,000 
each. The university argued that even 
after the increases, those salaries were 
still below the market rate. 

According to Keigwin, this pay 
hike was one of the primary reasons 
behind the new amendment. 

“[The regents] continuously take 
care of those at the top of the food 
chain and hurt those at the bottom,” 
Keigwin said. “Enough is enough.”

The amendment would make 
state laws applicable to the university, 
though it does not explicitly contain 
any policy suggestions or changes. 

One piece of legislation that could 
apply to the UC system should the 
amendment pass is Senate Bill 217, 
also drafted by Yee, which would pro-
hibit executive pay increases in years 
of financial crisis. 

Both the Senate and Assembly 
would have to pass the proposal with 
a two-thirds majority before it  could 
go before the voters.

munication department and student 
organizations.”

The council will also examine the 
possibility of creating a media room 
in Student Center or Price Center. The 
media center would provide work-
space and technological resources to 
print organizations like the Koala and 
California Review, and broadcast net-
works such as KSDT and Student-Run 
Television. 

SRTV General 
Manager Ali Hadian 
said a media center 
would be a great 
help because poor 
conditions in the 
organization’s cur-
rent Student Center 
space — including a 
poor ventilation sys-
tem — make filming 
difficult. 

The survey will 
assess student inter-
est in A.S. services 
— programs that the 
council finds ben-
eficial to the student body  — includ-
ing A.S. Safe Ride, the holiday airport 
shuttle and the A.S. Graphic Studio. 

Benesch said Safe Ride is likley to 
see the most changes, as councilmem-
bers claim the service became too slow 
after it switched providers from Cloud 
9 Shuttles to Express Shuttles in fall 

2008. 
“We renegotiated contracts last 

year to try to save some money, and 
that was great because we do want to 
make things more efficient,” Benesch 
said. “But unfortunately, it seemed like 
there was a big difference in the service 
[Express Shuttles] provided. We want 
to look back and see if [these concerns 
are] the general sentiment and, if [they 
are], try to see what we can do.”

He said it is unlikely the service 
will immediately 
change its provider 
or alter its hours of 
operation — cur-
rently Tuesday, 
Thursday, Friday 
and Saturday nights 
between 10 p.m. and 
2 a.m. Additionally, 
its annual budget of 
$27,000 will remain 
the same.

Benesch said the 
council will evalu-
ate student opinion 
about the holiday 
airport shuttle to see 

if there is demand for later hours. The 
survey will address more general stu-
dent opinions about the A.S. Graphic 
Studio, because it is a relatively new 
service.

and design-oriented courses. 
Subramaniam said many stu-

dents in the pre-med track only 
want to go to medical school instead 
of pursuing work in engineering. 
The department will replace the pre-
med track with a new major that 
will focus on engineering and design 
while still preparing students for 
medical school. 

“The [pre-med] program was a 
little diluted because the students 
felt that they were not getting very 
strong engineering foundations,” 
Subramaniam said. “So we decided 
in order to give them what they want, 
we need to morph it into something 
where the students would be both 
confident with what they are learning 
and prepared with a more quantita-
tive background.” 

Subramaniam said the replace-
ment track will most likely be called 
“biosystems: biomedical devices,” and 
that it could become available by 2011.

Both the biotechnology and bio-
engineering tracks offer admission to 
only 35 students per year. Currently, 
students must apply to the tracks 
as freshmen, and are not allowed to 
transfer in later.  

According to A.S. Engineering 
Senator Shikha Kothari, the 10 appli-
cants with the highest GPAs will be 
admitted into the programs. 

Kothari said the biotechnology 
and bioengineering tracks are the 
most competitive and desirable in the 
department because they are certi-
fied by the Accreditation Board of 
Engineering and Technology. 

Because many employers and 
graduate schools require ABET 

accreditation, graduating with a 
major not certified by ABET can 
significantly limit competitiveness 
in the bioengineering industry, 
according to the department’s Web 
site.

Freshmen and sophomores who 
are currently enrolled in the pre-med 
track and have completed their pre-

requisite courses will be allowed to 
apply for admission into the new bio-
engineering and biotechnology open-
ings. The 2009-10 freshman class will 
be the last class to complete the pre-
med program.

die out over the summer. 
At the same time, committee mem-

bers said it was important to avoid 
— if only by a few weeks — a repeat 
of the 2007 speech-policy proposal’s 
chaotic finals-week release. Those revi-
sions were immediately attacked by the 
American Civil Liberties Union, the 
Academic Senate and student activists 
for being draconian.

But by the end of the May 6 meet-
ing, UCSD Police Department Lt. 
Dave Rose and Campus Counsel Dan 
Park were still concerned over lan-
guage that would require all enforce-
ment to be enacted “in a manner that 
minimizes the impact on expressive 
activity” — already changed two weeks 
prior from the students’ original “in 
the least restrictive manner possible” 
— because it would be difficult for 
police to interpret.

Rose and Park told fellow commit-

tee members that from a legal perspec-
tive, “minimal” impact could techni-
cally be defined as no impact at all, 
and overall impact on free expression 
is difficult to predict. 

A.S.-appointed student represen-
tative Erin Brodwin said that “mini-
mum” does not necessarily mean zero, 
at which point Committee Chair Sally 
Brainerd pulled up the Cambridge 
Online Dictionary definition of “mini-
mum” and “minimal” on the overhead 
projector. 

Finally, though graduate student 
representative Benjamin Balthaser 
looked somewhat defeated (he had 
originally resisted any change from “in 
the least restrictive manner possible”), 
the committee agreed to instead use 
“in a manner that minimizes the limi-
tation on expressive activity,” which 
Rose said would be a very straightfor-
ward requirement for police to follow.

Brainerd proposed that — though 

the public-comment period will not 
officially begin until the first week 
of Fall Quarter 2009 — Balthaser 
should present the finished draft to 
the Graduate Student Association, and 
Brodwin and fellow undergraduate 
representative James Baldwin should 
present it to the A.S. Council for pre-
liminary review. The public comment 
period will extend until the end of the 
upcoming Fall Quarter, and the com-
mittee will consider all input during 
Winter Quarter 2010, Brainerd said. 

Once those final changes have been 
made, Vice Chancellors Penny Rue 
and Steven W. Relyea will approve and 
release the policy. 

The meeting closed with one 
final add-on to the “chalking” clause: 
“Environmentally sound clean-up is 
encouraged.”

It has been two years since the uni-versity was forced by a coalition of students, civil-rights groups, 
staff and faculty to retract its con-
stitutionally troubled speech policy. 
Condemned by groups and institu-
tions ranging from the American Civil 
Liberties Union and labor unions to 
the Academic Senate, it was a draco-
nian policy that forbade all protest 
without prior approval from admin-
istrators, banned political speech by 
university employees while on campus 
and assigned university minders to 
student demonstrations. 

Since that time, the university 
reconvened the PPM 510 speech and 
advocacy committee, with the addition 
of three student representatives from 
the Graduate Student Association and 
the A.S. Council. The students were 
assured that the administration had no 
idea who was responsible for the previ-
ous policy, and besides, those nobodies 
who never existed surely wouldn’t do 
it again. 

The students brought forth their 
own counterproposal. The proposal 
was sweeping, but also quite simple: It 
demanded an open campus in which 
speech rights would be enjoyed by 
students, staff, faculty and community 
members, provided they did not create 

a sustained disruption. Unlike the pre-
vious policy draft, the students did not 
see free speech — and even the occa-
sional disruptive speech act — to be at 
odds with the primary educational and 
social role of a university. 

As was suggested by a memo from 
the Academic Senate, protests for civil 
rights and against the Vietnam War 
during a previous generation were seen 
at the time as disruptive but ultimately 
created a more open, vibrant univer-
sity. According to Thomas Jefferson, 
a little disruption every now and then 
can be healthy for a democracy. 

After over a year of criticizing the 
student draft, the administration final-
ly offered its counterproposal. Despite 
the fanfare, what the administration 
proposed is ultimately a dressed-up 
version of what has been practiced 
at UCSD for decades: Price Center, 
Library Walk, the Geisel Library tree 
and the Student Center grassy hill are 
generally available for student demon-
stration with amplified sound, while 
the rest of the university has limited 
access.

Highlights from the new affiliates 
policy include:

The campus is open for gathering 
and demonstration without amplified 
sound for university affiliates, as well 
as individuals and groups sponsored 
by affiliates.

With handheld amplified sound 
(e.g. bullhorn), affiliates — as well 
as groups and individuals sponsored 

by affiliates — may engage in speech 
activity without reservation at the 
part of Library Walk adjacent to Price 
Center, the Geisel tree, the Student 
Center hill and Price Center Plaza.

Selected areas on campus from 
11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., give or take, 
are available for speech activity with 
handheld amplified sound including 
Revelle Plaza, Warren Quad, Sun God 
Lawn, Muir Quad, Solís Quad, ERC 
Green and the Sixth College Residency 
Court.

Reservations for events and speech 
activity with amplified sound will con-
tinue unchanged.

Posting remains limited to bulletin 
boards, kiosks and selected areas in 
Price Center.

The university will minimize limi-
tations on free speech when enforc-
ing the policy. Examples include being 
asked to turn down the volume rath-
er than being shut down, or being 
asked to allow traffic through a cor-
ridor rather than being asked to vacate. 
Administrators must also warn and 
negotiate with demonstrators before 
taking enforcement action unless there 
is a clear and present danger of physi-
cal harm.

Student representatives were suc-
cessful in ensuring that the adminis-
tration will enforce the policy with a 
light touch. We were also successful 
in ensuring that restrictions to speech 
outside the student centers and Library 
Walk be limited to sound volume. 

In other words, under the new 
policy, students and employees will be 
able to assemble, gather and speak any-
where on campus. While the proposed 
policy doesn’t open up the campus 
as students imagined, it also doesn’t 
enforce free-speech zones.

As one of the students who advo-
cated an open university, I am disap-
pointed by the new policy. Nonetheless, 
I reluctantly endorse it. The univer-
sity should recognize that students and 
employees won an important victory 
— they defeated an unjust and harsh 
policy and made important improve-
ments over the current policy. 

Perhaps most importantly, they 
won the explicit right to student noti-
fication and representation should 
any changes be proposed to the new 
policy. We did not get everything we 
wanted, and indeed, the student draft 
was largely defeated in the commit-
tee. But we were able to defend and 
even expand upon the basic right of 
students and employees to organize, 
speak and protest without undue inter-
ference by university authorities.

I also say this because students 
have a much larger free-speech fight 
looming. While the students were 
hard at work trying to fight for a new 
policy at UCSD, the UC Board of 
Regents passed a nonaffiliates policy 
last year — perhaps the biggest change 
in speech policy to affect a public uni-

STATE NEWS — When the UC 
Board of Regents held a teleconference 
for its annual fee-raising powwow in 
May, students stormed the call for 
a courtesy 20-minute question-and-
answer session. They shared stories 
of financial difficulties, begging the 
regents to keep fees low.

But once board members had 
grown impatient with the pity input 
session, they hastily wrapped up the 
conversation and voted to hike stu-
dent fees. Though they’d never publicly 
admit it, they made one thing crystal 
clear that day: Students have no influ-
ence over administrative decisions at 
the University of California.

But a new bill — introduced last 
Wednesday by state Senators Leland 
Yee (D-San Francisco/San Mateo) and 
Roy Ashburn (R-Bakersfield) — could 
potentially shift a lot more power to 
students.

The legislation proposes to remove 
the 130-year-old statute that grants the 
UC system immunity from legislative 
control by 2011, meaning the state 
could pass laws regulating university 
policies and pay practices. Sure, this 
wouldn’t necessarily mean you and 
your lab partner would be deciding 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox’s sal-
ary, but it would certainly establish 
more public accountability between 
California voters, the officials they 
elect and the state’s flagship higher-
education system.

After recently hiring two new 
chancellors for the UC San Francisco 
and UC Davis campuses with annual 
salaries over $400,000, it’s question-
able whether UC President Mark G. 
Yudof and the crew can keep them-
selves from offering their higher-up 

pals exorbitant benefits. More state 
control could do the UC system right 
by ensuring more frugal hiring deci-
sions in times of crisis, or — at the very 
least — preventing already overin-
flated salaries from being hiked during 
a recession.

State legislators may have an equal-
ly bad (if not worse) history of irre-
sponsible budgeting, but at least they 
are under strict laws to ensure that 
public officials’ compensation is fair 
and transparent.

Currently, Chancellor Marye Anne 
Fox earns $382,416 a year — quite 
the pretty penny when compared to 
the $212,179 annual salary Arnold 
Schwarzenegger chooses not to accept 
for his gubernatorial duties. Though 
overseeing UCSD is probably a cool 
breeze compared to running the entire 
state of California, that hasn’t stopped 
the UC Board of Regents from boost-
ing the pay and bonuses of many 
administrators well above those of our 
elected state officials. 

Although Yudof and other oppo-
nents of the bill think regulating the 
university is too extreme a step — they 
say academics and politics shouldn’t 
mix — they’re exaggerating the legisla-
tion’s potential effects. The law would 
authorize enforcing the state’s speech 
policies and pay practices at the uni-
versity, but would have no real influ-
ence on academic decisions. 

The California State University 
system, which isn’t immune to state 
law like the University of California, 
doesn’t deal with state legislators who 
want to regulate specifics in their cur-
riculum. Rather, CSUs have benefited 
from legislation (proposed by Leland, 
uncoincidentally) that bans trustees 
from raising executive salaries during 
years when state funding has been cut.

passes, it should be a wake-up call 
to the regents: Students are fed up 
with their executive power trips. Even 
though the regents’ 20-minute input 
session was a sweet attempt at pre-
tending they care, students need more 
solid reassurance that those up top are 
spending precious (and rising) tuition 
revenue wisely.

We’ve reached the year’s end! Now just one more exam-crammed two-week 
sprint until we’re done! If you’re 
lucky, this means beach basking and 
Slurpee sipping the summer away. 
But if you’re like me, it means gradu-
ation and saying a sad goodbye to 
a UCSD institution: “Lights and 

Sirens.” And so it’s with a heavy heart 
that I present to you the final install-
ment of “Stealing the Shoes” in the 
form of my annual Best of “Lights 
and Sirens.”

Let’s get the ball rolling with the 
Outstanding Senior Award. This 
year’s prize is shared by three cos-
tumed characters: The troubadour 
who put on his own show outside the 
La Jolla Playhouse on April 30, wear-
ing a Burger King crown and yelling; 
the fashionista dressed in all red leath-
er at Geisel Library on Oct. 13; and 
the man hanging around the Institute 
for Telecommunications building in a 
“sailor-like” hat on Feb. 3. 

Next, the debut of a much-
deserved accolade: MacGyvers of the 
Year. Congrats to the three young 
men who broke into Argo Hall over 
winter break armed with just a few 
tools and “a little white dog.” Their 
ingenuity and prioritizing finesse 
is matched only by the stupidity of 
these next winners. This year’s Uh, 
You’re Dumb Award goes to the per-
son who sent a series of threatening 
e-mails to the literature department, 
then retracted them after realizing 
he’d contacted the wrong department. 
The girl who called police after get-
ting wasted and missing her flight 
home was a close runner-up. And 
honorable mentions go to the student 
who, somehow, accidentally got super 
glue in his eye during lab (it was “not 
burning”) and the guy who dislocated 
his shoulder “trying to get out of bed.”

Similarly, the Only at UCSD 
Award goes to the citizen who 
reported a chemical spill on April 
6, emphasizing that the radioactive 
material had been “decayed over four 
half-lives”!

On a more somber note, I pres-
ent the Most Convincing Evidence 
that Racism is Alive and Well in 
California Award to the callers who 
reported the black male carrying a 
“large box with candy” on Sept. 30, 
the black male “leaning on the wall” 
at Ridgewalk on Oct. 6, the black 
male walking toward the Chancellor’s 
House on Nov. 19, the black female 
at the La Jolla del Sol apartments on 
Feb. 25, the Latino male at Villa La 
Jolla Drive on May 11 and the Latino 
male “wearing shorts” at the Stein 
Clinical Research building on Oct. 2.

To all the residents who called 
police on their neighbors — for a 
“loud fan” on April 19, the “laugh-
ing” at Goldberg Hall on Sept. 30, the 
“singing” at Beagle Hall on April 8, 
the “talking” in a Thurgood Marshall 
College dorm room on Oct. 19, 
the “jazz music” at Africa Hall on 
Feb. 17 and the “violin playing” at 
Kathmandu Hall on April 22 — espe-
cially the person who complained that 
the “Sun God Festival was too loud,” 
you have buzzkillingly embraced

versity in decades. 
The policy bans all free-speech 

activity on campus by the public — 
including alumni, parents and former 
staff — unless granted explicit permis-
sion by the university or invited by an 
affiliated member of campus. 

Rather than imagine a university 
that is a vibrant and necessary cen-
ter for democratic and civic engage-
ment, the regents imagine a sealed-
off office park in which students 
and researchers will not have to be 
troubled by a public — a public that 
is increasingly phased out of a uni-
versity dedicated more and more to 
corporate research. 

With this privatized public, the 
university creates a troubling prece-
dent in which only those who pay have 
access to public institutions. This not 
only deprives the public of a valuable 

resource, it deprives students of the 
crucial capacity to hear, engage with 
and debate voices from the community 
around them. 

Nearly all social movements involv-
ing students that were worth their salt 
— from labor to civil rights to global 
solidarity — depended on these non-
affiliates to reach out to the broader 
world. And as access is increasingly 
denied to low-income students due 
to fee hikes and proposed cuts to the 
Cal Grant program, those who can pay 
become a smaller and smaller number 
of people. 

While we have won a local victory 
in defeating the draconian policy of 
two years ago, I’m afraid we may be 
losing a larger fight for free speech in 
the entire UC system.

Dear Editor,
As one of many UCSD alumni who 

go on to attend UC Hastings College of 
the Law, I was shocked and dismayed 
by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s radi-
cal proposal to eliminate all state fund-
ing for California’s oldest law school.

Hastings is a first-tier law school 
that has been educating our nation’s top 
leaders for 131 years. Notable alumni 
include two California Supreme Court 
justices; numerous state and federal 
judges and politicians; and civil-rights 
leaders such as the assassinated San 
Francisco Mayor George Moscone and 
Clara Shortridge Foltz, the first practic-
ing female lawyer in the United States. 

Hastings also publishes several 
acclaimed scholarly journals — includ-

ing the oldest constitutional law jour-
nal in the country — and our Moot 
Court program is currently ranked 
second in the nation.

Schwarzenegger’s proposal would 
single out Hastings for a 100 percent 
cut in funding, compared to an esti-
mated 18 percent to 22 percent funding 
reduction to the UC and California 
State University systems. This decision 
would eliminate 25 percent of Hastings’ 
academic budget and could lead to 
yearly tuition increases of $8,000 per 
student. Such disproportionate treat-
ment is unjust and alarming. If the pub-
lic lets Schwarzenegger decide which 
educational institutions are worthy of 
state funding, there’s no telling which 
schools could be on the chopping block. 

Cutting $10.3 million from 
Hastings will barely make a dent in the 
$24 billion deficit. What it could do, 
however, is jeopardize the livelihoods 

of current students and shake public 
faith in the stability of the otherwise 
stellar UC system.

I urge members of the UC commu-
nity to unite against these drastic mea-
sures by contacting their state and local 
representatives. With a strong and unit-
ed voice, we can show Schwarzenegger 
that California cannot attain stability by 
weakening the institutions that produce 
its political and social leaders.

UCSD’s acidic no-fun atmosphere. 
For this, you have earned the 2008-09 
Thanks for Making This Place What 
It Is Award.

Changing gears, I’d like to con-
gratulate the following couples for 
boldly earning a Get It Girl Award: 
The pair seen “engaging in lewd 
activity” in front of Burger King just 
after 2 a.m. on Jan. 15, and the couple 
reported as “having sex real loud” at 
Geneva Hall on May 6.

Next, the Use What You Got to 
Get What You Want Award goes 
to the 10 intoxicated ladies who, in 
expert fashion, strutted along Gilman 
Drive wearing only black underwear 
on Nov. 6. Honorable mentions go to 
the guy who found a lost cell phone 

on Oct. 26 and promised to return it 
only in Tijuana and only in exchange 
for $20 and a Powerade, and the per-
son who bought lunch at Thornton 
Hospital with a forged $10 bill. 

And finally, here’s this colum-
nist’s last nod to college debauchery. 
I’m pleased to announce a four-way 
Shining Light in “Lights and Sirens” 
Award tie. Congrats to the group 
who snuck into Canyonview pool 
for some after-hours swimming on 
Oct. 4, the students who hauled a 
keg into Pacific Hall on Sun God, the 
guys seen climbing the bear statue on 
Sept. 29 and the pirate fellow hang-
ing out near University Centers 201 
on Jan. 26 with a “full bottle of rum.” 
Thanks for lending this place a little

      UNCOMMON F O L K

UCSD and the Kumeyaay tribe continue a legal battle over 10,000-year-old 
American-Indian skeletons unearthed from beneath the chancellor’s house.

M ansions built atop ancient American-Indian burial grounds are the stuff of legends. But just off campus on Regents Road, that 
stereotype is more fact than fiction.

Sitting literally on top of an ancient 
American-Indian cemetery — UCSD’s records 
show 29 human remains have been removed 
from the chancellor’s historic residence over 
the past 80 years — the University House was 
declared unlivable in 2004 due to hazards and 
structural problems. 

The approximately 10,000-year-old bones 
of the two adults were dug up from the prop-
erty in 1976 by Cal State Northridge archeol-
ogy students. The two skeletons are frozen in a 
unique arrangement, with a young man buried 
at the feet of an older woman. They are among 
the oldest skeletal remains yet discovered in 
the Western Hemisphere, and form the only 
“double burial” of their kind in the Americas. 

The Kumeyaay Cultural Repatriations 
Committee (KCRC), a group of federally rec-
ognized San Diego tribes, submitted a request 
to the university in 2006 asking for the remains 
to be repatriated   — or returned — to the 
Kumeyaay Indians.

The KCRC asserted that their ancestors have 
been here since “time immemorable,” and said 
they intend to rebury the remains if they are 
returned. 

The Native American Grave Protection and 
Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), federal legislation 
passed in 1990, details the official guidelines 

by which human remains can be identified and 
returned to American-Indian tribes that request 
them.

The NAGPRA states that remains must be 
expeditiously returned when a tribe can prove 
cultural affiliation. This occurs when a “prepon-
derance of the evidence — based on geographi-
cal, kinship, biological, archeological, linguistic, 
folklore, oral tradition, historical evidence, or 
other information or expert opinion — reason-
ably leads to such a conclusion.”

In 2008, a UCSD panel assigned with the 
task of determining cultural affiliation con-
cluded that the bones were “culturally uniden-
tifiable.” The panel submitted a report that said, 
“Our finding is that there is not a significant 
preponderance of evidence to support an affir-
mation of cultural identification or affiliation 
with any modern group.” 

The KCRC found this highly offensive. 
“We know that they are culturally identifi-

able,” KCRC spokesman Steve Banegas said. “All 
we want is to merely rebury them, and respect 
them, and treat them as the human beings that 
they once were.”

Banegas criticized the way the university has 
continued to handle the situation.

“This institution is supposed to be teaching 
people about values and learning and under-
standing, and wanting to stretch their hand 
out to the Kumeyaay nation,” he said. “But they 
refuse to sit and talk with us as equals, and we’re 
not going to get anywhere until that happens.”

Ross Frank, a UCSD professor and chair of 

the ethnic studies department, presented the 
single dissenting view in the panel. He said the 
methodology used by the committee was flawed 
because it looked at each piece of evidence pre-
sented by the Kumeyaay in an isolated manner. 

According to Frank, evaluating pieces of evi-
dence independently from each other is contra-
dictory to the language and spirit of NAGPRA. 
He said that evaluating all the pieces of evidence 
as a whole would “weave a kind of tapestry” that 
supports cultural affiliation. 

“If you did that, and did that in an interdisci-
plinary manner, using both scientific and social 
scientific methods, you could reasonably come 
to a conclusion that there is, in fact, a cultural 
affiliation,” he said.

Frank also pointed out that the review com-
mittee did not have any native representation, 
and his minority report strongly supported 
cultural affiliation. 

Margaret Schoeninger, anthropology profes-
sor and head of the review committee, defended 
her designation of the bones as unidentifiable. 

“We had taken the whole thing together,” 
Schoeninger said. “What bothers me extremely 
deeply is the dismissal of an evidence-based 
belief system and the privileging of a belief-
based system. I don’t doubt that the people are 
genuine, nor do I have a lack of respect. But 
they’re beliefs, they’re feelings … NAGPRA is 
not based on deeply held feelings.” 

A UC-wide committee later confirmed the 
original committee’s majority ruling of the 
bones as culturally unidentifiable, dashing most 

hopes the KCRC had of repatriation. 
That is, until a request from Vice Chancellor 

of Resource Management and Planning Gary 
Matthews was submitted to UC Office of the

T he clouds darken. Avian war cries resound, and the orchestra leaps into a baleful tremolo as unsuspect-
ing academics star  — one by one — in 
the storied horror plot of the Price Center 
stairway. 

It’s a live Alfred Hitchcock flick in full 
color, and the audience is growing.

The saga began May 18, when 
University Centers officials received word 
that a small, black bird was aggressively 
swooping down on pedestrians as they 
descended from Library Walk to Price 
Center Plaza. Upon investigation, main-
tenance staff discovered two Brewer’s 
blackbirds guarding a nest of four eggs — 
which hatched Friday — in a tree above 
the stairs.

According to associate professor of 
ecology, behavior and evolution David 
Holway, the bird’s behavior is not ran-
dom. During periods of fledging, Brewer’s 
blackbirds — like many other avian spe-
cies — are extremely protective of their 
young.

Disinclined to disturb the nest, 
University Centers Director Paul Terzino 
and his staff decided to post signs at each 
end of the path warning passersby of the 
territorial residents.

“We’re just trying to protect the things, 
but protect our students at the same time,” 
he said. “It’s comical, but in a macabre 
kind of way.”

Reports of physical damage have been 
more or less limited to light tickling and 
disheveled hair; more notable is the fan 
base that has accumulated with the rise in 
attacks. Spectators now frequent the stairs 
to encourage the bird, and online chatter 
has exploded.

Eleanor Roosevelt College junior 
Sylvie Lee, a two-time victim, has posted 
hours of video footage on the humorous 
“self-help” Facebook group she created 
for victims. 

If anything, she said, the phenomenon 
has unified the campus community.

“Honestly, it’s hilarious,” she said. “It’s 
the best thing to happen to campus in a 
while.”

Her Facebook group, “Victims of the 
Price Center Bird,” has attracted over 
1,300 members in just two weeks. Its long 
list of comments includes violent threats 
and elaborate apocalyptic theories. 

One blogger, Revelle College freshman 
Sameer Bahl, cited the Book of Genesis, 
suggesting that animals on college cam-
puses have overstepped their inferior 
“place in society.”

“I think animals on college campuses 
feel they have a sense of entitlement,” 
he said. “I’ve seen them poop on people 
shamelessly.”

Nevertheless, Lee and Bahl empha-
sized that their commentary is facetious, 
and they urged victims to refrain from 
harming the birds.

University Centers Associate Director 
John Payne said potential deterrents 
would include amplified predator noises 
and large Mylar balloons with eyes, but 
that these options are both unsightly and 
expensive.

“We’ll prune the trees more frequently 
so we can see the nests, but there are times 
when nature and man just have to try to 
get along the best they can,” he said.

In an effort to inform students about the ongoing investigation of the suspected cancer cluster in the Literature Building, several faculty members 
held ofﬁ ce hours in a tent on Library Walk on 
Thursday, May 28. Though it was more subdued 
than previous department teach-ins on the matter 
conducted by professors and graduate students, 
organizers hoped the event would keep the rest 
of the campus mindful of the situation. John D. 
Blanco, one of the coordinators, said he hopes to 
see a solution to occupants’ worries soon, but added 
that if the investigation and remedial measures 
continue to drag on, department staff and faculty 
are prepared to hold more events on Library Walk or 
in front of Chancellor Marye Anne Fox’s ofﬁ ce.

INFOCUS Literature Department Teach-In

U CSD political science professor Alan Houston spent hours sitting in the British Library — United Kingdom’s national public library 
— scouring a seemingly endless pile of manuscripts, 
before finally reaching his last catalog. Despite its 
dreary title, upon reading handwritten manuscript 
“Copies of Letters Relating to the March of General 
Braddock,” Houston said he nearly jumped out of 
his seat. 

He had just discovered copies of 47 letters both 
written by and addressed to Benjamin Franklin. 
Dating all the way back to 1755, the letters had not 
been brought to light in over 250 years, an unexpected 
treasure to inform his forthcoming book on Franklin’s 
political involvement.

The letters recount the story behind Franklin’s 
military campaign to provide wagons and horses to 
British Gen. Edward Braddock during the French and 
Indian War. They were archived by Thomas Birch, 
one of Franklin’s acquaintances at the Royal Society, 
which had just recognized Franklin for his scientific 
accomplishments in the field of electricity.

“Birch was an antiquarian — someone who col-
lects historical documents,” Houston said. “So Birch 
met [Franklin] because he was a scientist, but copied 
the letters because he saw them as important historical 
articles of the past about a military campaign that was 
notorious and deals with one of the greatest scientists 
from North America.”

Houston believes the letters had not been discov-
ered previously because they were in the handwriting 
of Thomas Birch, contained within Birch’s 400 vol-

umes of books, located on the shelves 
of the British Library.

“People had been less thorough 
in going through British archives 
than going in American archives,” 
Houston said. “In the catalog, it just 
said ‘Copies of Letters Relating to 
the March of General Braddock,’ and 
who would have thought that it had 
anything to do with Franklin? How 
I found them was just the accident 
of being a very diligent researcher, 
tracking down every possible source 
and looking at anything I could 
imagine.”

Although the letters do not pro-
vide any new information regarding 
Braddock’s military campaign and 
eventual defeat, they provide more 
ground-level details of the conflict 
between the militia and Pennsylvania 
farmers.

“The traditional way of understand-

ing the story was Benjamin Franklin 
went out and asked [the farmers] to 
borrow their horses and wagons, and 
they said, ‘Of course, we’re glad to 
help,’” Houston said. “But when you 
read the letters, it becomes clear that 
it’s a bit more complicated. [The farm-
ers] already had bad experiences with 
the army coming through and sol-
diers stealing their horses. They were 
already anxious and upset, unwilling 
to trust Franklin and army.”

The letters also provide more 
insight into Franklin’s relationship with 
his wife. Though Franklin has been 
dubbed a womanizer in modern biog-
raphies, the letters give him another 
chance.

“He ends [the letters] by telling how 
much he misses [his wife],” Houston 
said. “He tells her to write and how 
much he likes receiving letters from 
her. I’d like to think of it meaning that 
he felt some real affection for her.”

Houston’s discovery was printed 
for the first time in the April issue 
of the William and Mary Quarterly, 
a historical journal. The professor is 
currently in talks with the History 
Channel toward developing a segment 
on the letters.

“The real interest for the broad pub-
lic is that it’s on Benjamin Franklin, and 
he’s such a central figure to American 
identity,” Houston said. “The metaphor 
that I use is for someone looking for 
sunken ships. This is not like finding a 
whole ship; we already know too much 
[about Franklin] for that. It’s like find-
ing a treasure chest that’s filled with 
really cool stuff: coins and artifacts. 
And the thrill is that you didn’t even 
expect to find anything. History is still 
being made, and we’re still finding new 
things.”

President late last May, asking for 
a recommendation to the federal 
Department of the Interior to repa-
triate the bones.

“I believe that the wisest, most 
appropriate and most respectful 
action to take at this point would 
be to repatriate,” Matthews staid in 
the letter. “Doing so would achieve 
an outcome that is consistent with 
NAGPRA. Moreover, it would bal-
ance the scientific benefit that has 
already been achieved with the value 
of recognizing the sincere and pro-
foundly held cultural views that have 
been expressed by the representa-
tives of the Kumeyaay Nation in San 
Diego.”

Matthews also pointed out that 
repatriation could assist the uni-
versity’s push to increase diversity. 
Currently, less than 1 percent of the 
UCSD student body is American-
Indian, none of whom are Kumeyaay.

Though approval of Matthews’ 
request would return the bones to 
KCRC, it would not overturn the 
committee’s ruling that the remains 
are culturally unidentifiable. For this 
reason, leaders of the KCRC do not 
officially back the letter. 

A statement issued by the KCRC 
in early May stated that the Kumeyaay 
have provided the university with a 
mountain of evidence from linguistic, 
anthropological, archaeological and 

historical scholars to support their 
claim.

The statement said that accepting 
the remains as culturally unidentifi-
able “sets a dangerous precedent for 
future claims, both from KCRC and 
other tribes whose ancestors may be 
in the possession of the UC.”

Banegas said he feels the univer-
sity should admit the remains right-
fully belong to the Kumeyaay, and 
is offended to be asked for proof of 
something he feels is obvious.

“They give the impression that 
they want to give [the remains] back, 
but yet they have all these condi-
tions,” Banegas said. “They’ve given 
the impression that all we have to do 
is take them back and everything will 
go away, and that’s not true. For some 
odd reason, they don’t seem to think 
that they’re our ancestors … What 
they’re basing this on, I don’t know, 
other than a few people not wanting 
to repatriate for whatever reason.”

According to Science magazine, 
Schoeninger and members of the 
American Association of Physical 
Anthropologists sent a letter to the 
Department of the Interior claiming 
the bones are too important to be 
reburied. 

In April, at the annual meeting 
of the AAPA, Schoeninger made a 
presentation on the bones’ scientific 
importance.

However, Frank said the belief 

that scientists will be able to study the 
bones if they are not returned to the 
KCRC is merely a presumption. 

“If they find that they’re culturally 
unaffiliated, that doesn’t say anything 
about what happens to the bones,” 
Frank said. “What we have here is 
a system that assumes that it has 
the privilege of studying scientifically 
anything that’s not repatriated.”

A few weeks after sending the let-
ter to the Department of the Interior, 
university administrators officially 
withdrew the request, citing lack of 
support from the Kumeyaay.

“When we learned that the 
Kumayeey Cultural Repatriation 
Committee did not support the uni-
versity’s request — submitted to the 
federal NAGPRA review committee 
to repatriate the remains — the uni-
versity withdrew its request,” UCSD 
spokeswoman Stacie Spector said. 

The skeletons currently remain in 
university possession. 

Vice Chancellor of Research Art 
Ellis is in charge of drawing up a set 
of guidelines for curating and study-
ing the bones. Ellis was unable to 
comment as of press time.

“The next move is up to them,” 
Banegas said. “We’ve put in a number 
of requests and they’ve denied them. 
We’ll have to see.”

days [of rest]. I wanted to do what I 
could do to win the ballgame.”

Entering the game in a tight spot, 
Shibuya enticed the first Emporia 
State batter he faced to chase a 
ball down and away for a swinging 
strikeout. The next Hornet batter 
drove the Triton pitcher’s 1-2 pitch 
to center field for a single, but junior 
outfielder Robert Sedin’s accurate 
throw to home allowed junior catch-
er Kellen Lee to tag the Emporia 
State runner out at the plate. The 
outfield assist was UCSD’s second 
in the game, and saved the Tritons 
a run.

“The outfield assists were legit,” 
Tanner said. “They were huge in kill-
ing momentum for the other team 
and there aren’t many things that are 
more exciting than throwing out guys 
at the plate.”

With two out and runners on 
first and second, Emporia State drove 
another single to center field. This 
time, however, Sedin’s throw was up 
the line and the Hornets took a 3-1 
lead.

With their season on the line and 
only four innings left in the game, 
the Tritons took back a run in the 
fourth on an RBI single from Cantele 
that plated senior second baseman 
Garrett Imeson.

In the top of the eighth, Sedin 
erased UCSD’s deficit by scoring 
from third base on a passed ball.

“We have been doing it all year,” 
Tanner said of the Tritons’ numerous 
late-inning comebacks. “We never 
give up and we scratch and claw until 
the final out. We thrive on other 
teams getting tight under pressure 
and taking advantage of their mis-
takes.”

The game was locked in a 3-3 
tie when Emporia State came up 
to bat in the bottom of the ninth 
against Shibuya. The Hornets led 
the inning with a walk from third 

baseman Kevin Wempe before the 
Tritons induced a popup for the 
first out. Hornet right fielder Caleb 
Williamson singled to center field 
and — as Sedin threw the ball to 
third trying to tag the lead run-
ner — attempted to take second 
base. But Williamson was unable 
to catch the Tritons off guard, and 
Tanner quickly threw to second to 
catch the runner in a pickle for the 
second out.

With a runner on third base, 
O’Brien called on his closer — soph-
omore Guido Knudson — to pre-
serve the tie and send the game into 
extra innings. But Lane quelled those 
hopes, hitting the walk-off homer.

“I was shocked because it honestly 
had never even crossed my mind that 
we would lose,” Cantele said. “Our 
team was so close and confident that 
I was almost conditioned to believing 
that we would win.”

Despite falling short of a national 
championship, it was a year of firsts 
for the Tritons. UCSD won its first 
regular-season California Collegiate 
Athletic Association title and claimed 

its first regional championship, earn-
ing a spot at the College World Series.

“It was a great experience and one 
that I am going to remember for the 
rest of my life,” Cantele said of playing 
at nationals. “The atmosphere of the 
games were great, our fans were out-
standing as always and you could not 
ask to play on a nicer field than the 
U.S. national training center.”

Not only did they clinch a berth in 
the College World Series, the Tritons 
played well enough throughout the 
season to enter as the No. 1 seed.

“This is the best club that UC 
San Diego has ever had,” O’Brien 
said in a statement.  “It’s one thing 
to be talented, but it’s another to 
have guys that battle for one anoth-
er.  This is a group of guys I’d go 
into a trench with any day of my 
life. I just couldn’t be more proud of 
this team and how they competed. 
They played their hearts out and left 
everything out on that field.  That’s 
all you could ask for.”

Emporia State’s walk-off home run in the national semifinal
cuts short UCSD’s record-breaking year.

It took just one ping of the aluminum bat to halt UCSD’s historic run at a Division II title, only three wins shy of a Triton national championship.
No. 1 UCSD’s first trip to the Division-II College 

World Series came to a shocking close in the bottom 
of the ninth inning in the Tritons’ semifinal game 
against No. 3 Emporia State University on May 28. 

With two out and a runner on third for Emporia 
State in a tie game, Hornet senior Kellen Lane pow-
ered a 0-1 offspeed pitch that hit the scoreboard in 
right field for a walkoff homer. The long ball was the 
first of Lane’s career, and it sent UCSD home with a 
5-3 defeat.

“We left everything we had on the field,” senior 
first baseman Matt Cantele said. “Yeah, we had our 
chances to put some more runs on the board, but so 
did they. All in all, some people really stepped up. 
[Sophomore pitcher] Tim Shibuya threw everything 
he had and kept us in the game, [senior third base-
man] Josh Tanner was smacking the ball around the 
yard as usual and we had some huge outfield assists. 
We played a clean game for the most part. They just 
got a clutch hit on a good pitch and prevailed.”

The loss closed the Tritons’ season with a record 
of 41-15. The Hornets advanced to the Division-II 
National Championship game, where they fell 2-1 to 
Lynn University.

The Tritons advanced to the semifinal after win-
ning back-to-back elimination contests, and faced 
another must-win game against Emporia State, which 
was undefeated in the tournament.

UCSD sent junior Kirby St. John to the mound — 
the team’s fourth starting pitcher of the tournament 
— while Emporia State opted to pitch junior Colby 
Killian who started the Hornets’ first College World 
Series game.

After the Tritons went down in order during 
the top of the first, Emporia State led off its half of 
the inning with a double. The Hornets’ No. 2 batter, 
attempting to advance his teammate to third, bunted 
the ball too hard, allowing St. John to throw out the 
lead runner. 

With the game still scoreless, redshirt junior first 
baseman Brandon Gregorich drew a leadoff walk in 
the second inning. Gregorich advanced to third base 
after two groundouts and scored on Cantele’s RBI 
single to center field. 

Emporia State answered with a run in the third 
inning, using UCSD’s only error in the College World 
Series to put runners on the corners with no outs. The 
Hornets took advantage of another UCSD misstep to 
score on a balk from St. John and tie the game. 

The Hornets got their leadoff man on base in the 
fourth inning as well, when St. John hit catcher Mike 
Sharp with a pitch. After a failed sacrifice bunt from 
Emporia State in the next at-bat, Sharp advanced to 
second on a wild pitch and scored on a single.

With his team down 2-1, St. John walked the first 
batter he faced in the fifth inning. A single from the 
Hornets put two runners on base with none out, 
prompting head coach Dan O’Brien to pull his start-
ing pitcher from the game.

With his team facing elimination, O’Brien handed 
sophomore Tim Shibuya the ball to take over on the 
mound. Shibuya, the staff ace, pitched 7.2 innings in 
UCSD’s opening nationals game on May 24, throw-
ing 7.2 innings and allowing three runs while being 
tagged with the loss.

“I told coach I was ready to go,” Shibuya said in a 
statement “It didn’t matter if it was two days or 10

HOW THEY
GOT THERE

THE JOURNEY TO NATIONALS

Competing in the College World Series 
semifinal game represents the furthest 

UCSD baseball has advanced at the 
Division II level. Here’s a look at how the 
team made it to the NCAA Tournament.

MARCH 13 TO MARCH 29
▶  TRITONS TAKE DOWN THE NO. 1 SQUAD

UCSD bounces back from a series loss to Sonoma 
State University in which the Tritons fell in three 

consecutive one-run games by winning four straight 
against No. 1 Cal State Stanislaus. The Tritons rise to

No. 6 following the sweep.

FEB. 14 AND 15
▶  UCSD FALLS 3-1 TO

WESTERN OREGON UNIVERSITY

After climbing to the No. 2 ranking in Division II — 
the highest ever in program history at the time — 
the Tritons show some early season jitters in their 

first series, dropping to No. 25.

APRIL 9 AND 10
▶  UCSD OUTSCORES

GRAND CANYON UNIVERSITY 36-9

On the road in Arizona, the Tritons’ bats come alive 
in a three-game sweep over the Antelopes for their 

fourth-straight series win.

MAY 2
▶  TRITONS EARN TOP CONFERENCE SEED

In the last regular-season series, the Tritons clinch 
their first conference championship via Senior Day 

doubleheader sweep. The California Collegiate 
Athletic Association title earns UCSD the No. 1 seed 

at the conference tournament.

MAY 9
▶  TRITONS TAKE CCAA TOURNAMENT

Playing against Sonoma State University in the final 
game, the Tritons overcome a Seawolves rally in the 

ninth inning, scoring the winning run on a walk-off 
single for an 8-7 win.
