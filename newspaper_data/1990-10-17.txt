UCSD Researchers Discover Source of Memory 
• Primate study could lead to Alzheimer's breakthroughs 
By Kerry Hall 
Guardian Reporter 

Two UCSD researchers have 
recently discovered that a small re-
gion of the brain is crucial to the 
process of short-term memory for-
mation. 

In a study published in the Oct. 
12 issue of the journal Science, re-
searchers Stuart Zola-Morgan and 
Larry Squire reported their findings 
on the role of the hippocampus in 
the formation and temporary storage 
of memory. 

TIle experiment clearly shows 
the hippocampal involvement in the 
formation and temporary storage of 
new memory and gives new insight 
as to how the brain accomplishes 
learning: the hippocampus collects 
and consolidates information, and 
then makes it available for storage 
elsewhere in the brain. 

TIle hippocampus, a structure 
about a quarter inch in diameter and 
two inches long. is located deep 
within both the left and right sides of 
the brain. Although in the past this 
small bundle of nerve cells was 
known to be involved in memory 

retention, scientists did not know 
the extent of its involvement. 

"We now know the hippocam-
pus is critical in the processing of 
information," said Zola-Morgan, an 
associate professor of psychiatry at 
the UCSD School of Medicine and 
the Veterans Affairs Medical Cen-
ter. "As we learn new information, 
the hippocampus transforms the 
experiences to memory, but only 
temporarily." 

Previous studies of amnesic pa-
tients have shown that without the 
help of the- hippocampus, new in-
formation cannot be stored in long-
term memory. According to Zola-
Morgan, one can get a sense of this 
phenomenon by studying patients 
with retrograde amnesia. 

Patients with hippocampal 
damage, which causes retrograde 
amnesia, generally cannot remem-
ber recent events or recall informa-
tion received prior to the amnesic 
epIaode. Even with bippocampaI 
damage, however, long term 
memory remains intact. 

Squire, who is affiliated with the 
Department of Psychiatry at the 

UCSD School of Medicine, noted 
that while previous data suggested 
thatthehippocampu is notinvolved 
in the retrieval of information from 
the remote past, the specific role of 
the hippocampus in memory loss 
was unknown. 

According to Zola-Morgan, 18 
cynomolgus monkeys were trained 
for this research on five different 
object discrimination tests. 

Each test, conSisting of 20 pairs 
of objects, such as pencils or toys, 
was administered at 16, 12, eight, 
four and two weeks prior to surgery. 
A food reward was given to the 
monkeys each time they chose the 
correct match for the pair. 

The monkeys exhibited im-
provement in their selections of ob-
jects over the duration of the training 
period. 

Eleven monkeys then underwent 
surgical removal of the hippocam-
pus. Two weeks later the same bat-
tery of tests waS adminiite.red. The 
recollection of remote training that 
occurred eight, 12, and 16 weeks 
prior to surgery was similar among

Mac Labs Not Free at UCSD 
• Mac's Place is cheaper than off-campus copy centers, 
but many schools have free Macintosh labs for all students 
By Alyssa Enlow 
Guardian Reporter 

Johnny Appleseed 
may have planted apples 
across the nation for free, 
but a high-tech Johnny 
would have skipped over 
the UCSD campus. Un-
like most UC schools, 
UCSD students have to 
pay for the use of Apple 
Macintosh computers. 

Presently, UCSD 
does have several Mac 
labs on campus, but most 
of these are affiliated 
with academic depart-
ments rather than being 
open to student use. Stu-
dents must be enrolled 
in a specific class in or-
der to use the labs. 

The other schools 
within the UC system, 

Jenny VennJGu8rdian 
Debrah Reyes (right) is one of several students working on Macintosh 
computers for $5 an hour at Mac's Place in the Price Center. 

with the exception ofUC 
Berkeley, offer free use of uni-
versity-funded Macintosh labs to 
students. Outside of the UC, uni-
versities such as San Diego State 
and the University of San Diego 
also offer free macintosh labs for 
their students. 

For example, UC Santa Bar-
bara has four general computing 
labs which are partially elf- uf-
ficient from the ale of disc and 

otbercomputerneeds, receiving the 
rest of their money from university 
funding. UC Davis has 10 free labs 
which are paid for by state funds for 
computer-aided instruction. UC 
Irvine's free computer lab is pro-
vided as a ervice by the UCI 
bookstore. 

While UC Santa Cruz has sev-
eral Mac labs free to tudent and 
funded directly from regi tration 

fees, the campus does charge five 
cents for printing on an 
imagewriter dot-matrix printer 
and 25 cents for using a high-
quality laser printer. UCLA and 
Berkeley, like UCSD, each di-
vide their computer lab between 
individual departments, but have 
general computing centers which 
charge $6 and $4 per hour,

WHERE MEMORIES BEGIN 

• Research by UCSD scientists Stuart Zola-Morgan and 
Larry Squire indicates that initial memory formation and 
temporary storage of memories occur in the hippocampus, 
located deep inside the brain. Their findings were published 
in the Oct. 12 issue of Science magazine.

Scripps Clinic's Bloom 
Awarded $14 Million 
For A.I.D.S. Research 
• Study focuses on brains of victims 
By Melinda Hamilton 
Associate News Editor 

FloydBloom,aScrippsOinic 
researcher, was awarded a five-
year, $14 million federal grant 
Friday for research into compli-
cations caused by the A.I.D.S. 
virus. 

Bloom, the head of the De-
partment of Neuropharm-
ocology at Scripps Clinic and 
Research Foundation, will be 
applying the grant toward the 
study of dementia caused by 
A.I.D.S. 

According to Bloom, the 
grant will actually total $23 mil-
lion once other aspects of the 
grant are finalized. 

Scripps Clinic President 
Charles Edwards said that 
Bloom's grant is the largest single 
grant to be awarded to the clinic 
for biomedical research. 

The grant, awarded by the 
National Institutes of Mental 
Health, will fund the establi h-
ment of an A.l.D.S. Dementia 
Complex Re earch Center, 
which will be headed by Bloom. 

Twenty-three staff and fac-
ulty will be involved with the 
proj ct, along with a vi iting 
advisory committee, Bloom said. 

According to Bloom, the 

study will be focused on dementia 
in the early stages, and the bio-
logical study of the macrophages 
in the brain and how the HIV 
virus that cau es A.I.D.S. affects 
them. 

Bloom said that the project 
will use background information 
on studies conducted on similar 
viruses in cats and monkeys. 
The e model viruse infect cats 
and monkeys naturally and run 
their course in about two years, 
as opposed to 5 to 10 years in 
humans. 

Bloom aid that he believe 
there is a chemical from the mac-
rophages in the brain that dis-
rupts the normal working of the 
neurons without damaging them. 

TIle tudies are complicated 
by the fact that the virus mutates 
in each person, although the ba-
sic characteristics are the same in 
everyone, Bloom said. 

"The virus mutate rapidly, 
hiding from the immunesy tem," 
Bloom said. "The mutation is 
more potent against cell and 
varies from person to person." 

Bloom said the center will not 
be developing drug to combat 
the di ease, but would con ider

OfficIal Wams that State Budget 
Troubles Could Deren New UC 

FRESNO - Budget woes still could thwart plans to 
build a UniversityofCalifomiacampusin the San Joaquin 
Valley, a vice president wamed during visits to potential 
sites. 

The new school will be needed by 1998 when the 
current nine UC campuses are expected to be full, said 
William Baker, vice president on budget and university 
relations. But getting the money to build UC San Joaquin 
remains a problem, he told a reporter during a hearing last 
week on potential sites in the northem part of the valley. 

"The state of California is not in a strong budgetary 
situation," Baker said. "If resources are not available, we 
won't be able to build a 10th campus and would therefore 
have to tum away eligible California students for the frrst 
time in our history." 

But another UC vice president. Roger Brady, gave 
assurances that UC officials are still aiming for a fall 1998 
opening date for the valley campus. 

A task force of regents and UC staff officials toured all 
eight seminifinalist sites last week. 

The first day. the group went to the Mapes Ranch west 
of Modesto, the Don Pedro Reservoir area in the Sierra 
between Modesto and Sonora, and a site next JO Lake 
Yosemite on the edge of Merced. The schedule for the 
second day included the Table Mountain, Academy. 
TrimmerSprings, and Watts ValJey sites, all in the greater 
Fresno area. The officials toured the Frazier Valley site 
near Porterville on the third day of the tour.

UCLA Students Protest Columbus 
Day and Native American Remains 

LOS ANGELES - Nearly 200 UCLA students and 
faculty protested against UCLA's posession of Native 
American remains last week. 

Calling Columbus Day a cruel celebration of genocide,

Chancellor Charles Young's office in Murphy Hall, and 
refused to leave until the administrators scheduled a meeting 
between Young and the students.

University Center portion of the project, nor the $16.30 
increase which was also added for the Recreation Center. 

Administrators at UCSB felt that the summer fees.did 
not violate the spirit or intent of the student fee referen-
dum, because it is standard university policy to assess 
summer scbool students pro-rated fees. 

Said UCSB CbanceUor Barbara Uehling, "If anything, 
the ballot should have explicitly stated it would not 
include a summerfee.I'm sorry someone didn't sitdown 
and explain this to students." 

She added tbatstudents shouldhaveinferred a surnmer 
fee would be necessary in addition to the three regular 
quarter fees. "I'm saying it is voter approved. It says we 
will collect fees in three quarters, lIDd we have a university 
practice of collecting pro-rated fees in the summer," she 
said. 

According to ASUCSB President Michael Chester, 
"Any fee that is tacked on to students without a student 
vote is illegal as far as I'm concerned. This whole stupid-
ass UCen/RecCen was not my idea, but I want students to 
control it ..

Alzheimer's and encephalitis." 
Squire remarked that the re-

search could be considered an 
example of the benefits of using 
animal subjects to directly solve 
problems; without animal re-
search, the problem of memory 
loss could be guessed at for cen-

Some of the early symptoms of dementia include 
inability to concentrate or compute simple mathematics 
but can escalate in severity to hallucinations, Bloom 
said. He added that the more severe symptoms occur 
in over 80 percent of A.I.D.S. patients in the last six 
months to a year of their lives. 

Wednesday. 
The difference lay in the rec-

ollection ofinformation recently 
learned. The normal monkeys 
perfotmed bener on the recently 
learned tests, averaging 80 per-
cent accuracy, while the mon-
keys with hippocampal 
lesions performed with 
6Opercentaccuracyon 
the tests learned two 
and four weeks 
prior. 

The control 
monkeys made er-
rorsatanonnal rate, 
remembering infor-
mation most recently 
learned the best, while the ones 
with hippocampal damage re-
called older memories bener. 

"The research took many 
years to complete because it's 
tricky to get a paradigm showing 
a normal 'forgening' curve in 
monkeysratherthan in humans," 
Zola-Morgan said. 

"This is the first time we have 
been able todemoostrate clearly 
in the primate brain that while 
the hippocampus is initially in-
volved in memory fonnation, it 
is not along-term storage site for 
memory," he added. "It is an 
important area for us to under-
stand because it is linked to 
memory impairments .which 
occur in hurnan diseases, such as 

turies. 
The researchers said 

that next they would 
like to study the spe-

cifics of the hip-
pocampus' in-
volvement in how 
memory is consoli-
dated and trans-
formed to perma-
nent long-term stor-
age. 

"We now have a fundamen-
tal understanding of a brain re-
gion and its function because of 
work done with animals," Zola-
Morgan said. 

"Experimentally, this 
couldn't work with humans," he 
added. 'The onset of amnesia 
can't be predicted and the care-
fuUy controlled testing cannot 
be administered as necessary 
before the amnesic episode be-
gins. Previous studies had been 
done with rodents with some ' 
level of success. However, the 
issue remains that the brain of a 
monkey more closely approxi-
mates that of a human and thus 
the sametestscan beperfonned." 
he said. 

UCSD 

Most people do not even notice dementia in its 
early stages, usually taking five to seven years to 
recognize the problem, according to Bloom. Family 
members or friends often notice it before the patient 
does. 

The center will work in conjunction with another 
project headed by Igor Grant of the UCSD Depart-
ment of Psychiatry, who received a $19.5 million 
grant last year to fund the HIV Neurobehavioral 
Research Center. The center studies how long the 
virus takes to cause damage after the person is infected. 

"As [Grant] deals with the psychological, emo-
tional, and neurological fmdings, what we' re trying to 
do is get the biological equivalents. We' re trying to 
understand the basis for what his group is fmding," 
Bloom said. 

According to Bloom, the project will include work 
in the areas of chemisty, physiology, anatomy, and 
molecular genetics. 

CLARIFICATION 
The article "Possible Development of Re-

search Park for Industry Draws Criticism" in the 
Oct. 15 Guardian may have been misleading. 

The Eastgate Technology Park, described in 
the story, is a research park that is for sale by the 
City of San Diego, andislocatedhalfamile from 
UCSD's proposed park. 

The article mistakenly stated that theEastgate 
Technology Park was owned by UCSD. 

The Guardian regrets any confusion this 
problem in explaining the location of the two 
parks may have caused.

What's Wrong? Who's to Blame? 
Politicians blame the media for confining campaign news 
coverage to n'ne-second sound bites, concentrating on the 
personal lives of candidates and ignoring the problems of 
governance. On the other hand, the media blames politi-
cians for running negative campaigns, avoiding the hard 
issues and concentrating on emotional side shows. UCSO pr~ts a public policy forum in which a panel of experts, 
moderated by Professor Sam Popkin of UCSO's department 
of political science, will explore the following issues: 

• How have changing styles of coverage affected 
political campaigns? 

• Has the press kept up with campaig'lS? 
• Has the press been too preoccupied with 

investigating the personal lives of political figures? 
• Has the press /glared the real issues until too late?

THE ADMINISTRATION 

Ever-Present Conflicts 
History tells us of countless, immortal conflicts: Arab against 

Israeli, Protestant against Catholic, English against French, 
Italian against North African, and so on. Students can relate to 
these conflicts for one reason or another. Most college students 
today, whether they consciously realize it or not, are locked in 
a confl ict distinctly thei r own: Students against administrat ions. 

There is a distinct feeling of dissatisfaction among students 
at UCSD. The prevailing anitude is that the administration 
doesn't care about student concems; its sole purpose is to do 
what is easy for itself, even if it means compromising the 
interests of the students. 

This attitude is not without foundation. Consider the several 
hundred or so students left high and dry every quarter when 
classes are cancelled without waming, and no classes are 
created in their place. Consider [he already overworked and 
underpaid TAs who are expected to work miracles handling up 
to three undergraduate sections on top of demanding graduate 
work. 

Consider the some of the truly controversial issues of the last 
five years; the transfer of the campus liquor license from the old 
Triton Pub, the TGs, and the co-op lease disputes. All are 
essentially the same. The administration makes a decision, the 
students don't like the decision and complain, the administra-
tion f!Ods a rule saying the students' complaints are unfounded, 
and the administration gets its way. 

Leamingand teaching are no longer a top priority. Education 
has been pushed aside for grant-winning research and the quest 
for prestige. It's as if the administration places more importance 
on re-painting the Physical Plant Service's trucks than on the 
students ' education. 

Student empowerment - as nice as it sounds - is a joke. 
The Associate Students, with all its money and office space, is 
but an elaborate attempt at appeasement - a rubber stamp of 
"student" support. The A.S. wields very little, if any, true in-
fluence upon the administration's final decisions. When the 
chips are down, the administration will do what it feels is 
necessary to further its vision of UCSD. 

The same can be said for student representation on campus 
committees. On the Parking Committee, for example, students 
are given very little representation. Students on this committee 
have little say on large policy questions, such as fee increases. 
Rather, students are limited to more safety-oriented subjects, 
such as whether or not to put night parking vendors in the center, 
or on the side of the road. 

In matters of planning, students have virtually no say at all. 
Parking spaces are disappearing overnight, replaced by new 
buildings, but little has been done to replace the lots -let alone 
provide new spaces for the growing student and faculty popu-
lation. It seems as though the rumors of a giant parking lot east 
of the 1-5 may become reality, and students may find themselves 
being shuttled across the freeway by the 21 st century. 

The new student credit union is another example. Students 
neither own nor manage the new credit union. It is a subsidiary 
of the University and State Employees Credit Union (U.S.E.), 
an outside agency. Furthermore, while students may " in theory" 
be representatives to U.S.E., they have absolutely no say in 
policy-making decisions. 

10 some ways, the administration is correct. After all , many 
administrators will be around for years. Students come and go. 
The administration's view is limited to what it sees as good for 
the university as a whole, and cannot be swayed be the short-
sighted opinions of students. 

Students may come and go, but there will always be repre-
sentatives of the "student voice" - whatever that may be. There 
will always be advocates of "student rights ." 11Ie student 
presence will beconstant.But within an establishment completely 
engrossed in making it into Newsweek' s "Top 10 Colleges in the 
U.S.," student 's rights are just not apriority. 

The problem isn't just the chancellor, or the vice-chanceUors, 
or any of the others. The problem is the American system of 
higher education. Until it is fixed, the conflict between students 
and administrations will continue everywhere.

COMMENTARY 

Excuses; ~cuses. •• 
• The UCSD police and the politicians really 
couldn't care less about student safety 
By Jeff Plb .... 

As a flJ"8t-year graduate student at UCSD.l've 
been forced into contact with La Jolla's n:sicIentI . 
and authority figures only brieOy (thus far) in my 
three-monlb stay. But tbat exposure has beat 
enough to induce serious vomiting several times 
over. 

From wbal I've seen so far, UCSD soema like a 
university that could've been a p:etty cool plIc:e, " 
once upon a time. 

But now it is hobbling from several vicious 
blows 10 the Jast remaining legs of what was once 
a noble elephant of a social environment. CIJJ1'eI1tIy 
being hacked away by frantic, overzealous 
pygmies. For example, the generous local citizala 
who blithely banned alcohol at their beaches; 
UCSD Police Chief John Anderson, wbo cries 
"beer 81 TGs must stop," and San Diego'. Trans-
portation and Land Use Committee - a collection 
of cretins planning to evict all of us dangerOus, 
rent-paying college studc:nts frotn our "mini-
donns," for the unspeakable crime of trying to pay 
rent and eat in the same month, by living three 
people per apartment. 

Actually, this doesn' t swprlse me. Thugs like 
these are everywhere, usually cowering in front of 
their TVa glued to "America's Most Wanted:" but 
ready at any time 10 spring into action and seize a 
golden opportunity to fuck someone over. 

But I've learned to expect this, What really 
burns me is that they go out and do these things 
(Le. attempting 10 ban beer 81 the TGs) and then 
try to cover their belligerent asses by spouting out 
incredibly stupid, transparent, and obviously 
fabricated excuses/reasons slICb as "I'm concemed 
about the safety of students." 

This point, of course. is when they start 
exposing just exactly how extensive their sordid 
little personal vendettas really are. 

TIle issue facing John Anderson and tbeUCSD 
police was, as we well know, the servill8 of beer at 
the 1'05, about whicb Anderson's opinion WaI, 
fumly, that be opposes it. 

His additional (undoubtedly unsolicited) 
comments are wbat trip him up, 

He foolishly goes 00 to sternly warn US about 
the horrendous liability threat caused by undorap 
drinkers, who bring their own alcohol 10 the TOt. 
He then adds a few wheezes about the danger of 
dnmk driving. 

What eludes him here is that if these hordes of 

half-mad. &lobbeIing-dnmk minors are out on the 
streelS ofLaJoUa, aaaedJy cuttiog pedestrians to

COMMENTARY 

Male Morals Must Change 
• Men should stop viewing women as sex objects 
By Stephen Bach 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

In Berkeley a deranged man 
holds students hostage and forces 
young coeds to takeofftheirclothes. 
A serial killer tellOrizes the Uni-
versity of Rorida. A series of rapes 
occurat UCSD. Soon after, another 
series of rapes occur in the Cal State 
Long Beach area. And then there's 
the Clairemont slayer who seems to 
have an infatuation with targeting 
college coeds as they leave their 
bathroom showers. 

11lese are just some of the news 
headlines that have been plaguing 
our nation and thus reinforcing the 
rest of the world ' s impression that 
America is a dangerous crime-rid-
den society. 

But there's a peculiar trend in the 
recentseriesofviolence.1be targets 
of these heinous criminal acts are 
young college coeds. 

Whether one is blond, brunette 
- if you're a college-age female, 
you have reason to fear. 

So the inevitable question arises: 
who or what is to blame for this 
troubling trend? 

Certainly there is no single cause 
that accounts for the sadistic vio-
lence, and many may disagree about 
the cause. 

But there is one factor that can-
not be denied. The specific causes 
of these acts of violence work within 
the framework of a society that 
implicitly consents to violence 

against women. 
And within that context, young 

college coeds are the ideal victims. 
Lookaroundtodayatpopculture 

and what do you see? 2 Live Crew 
makes a fortune capitalizing on their 
crude and infantile lyrics dealing 
with physical mutilation of the fe-
male genitalia. 

One of the highest grossing 
movies of the past year, "Preny 
Woman," portrays the life of a 
prostitute as quite glamorous. 

On the TV sitcom, "Married with 
Children," sexual jokes and innuen-
dos are common and pathetic one-
liners. 

What do we see on our very own 
campusbutafratemitythatconsiders 
portraying themselves as "uncom-
promising" macho men to bea won-
derful way to attract new recruits. 

It is accepted practice to view 
women as simply Objects of male 
desires. Quite often, women as 
complete human beings are easily 
overlooked 

When guys get together for a rap 
session, references to mating are the 
norm. It's not so much a meaningful 
discussion of a woman' s complete 
persona than it is ajuvenile biology 
lesson. 

Some of you reading this are 
already chuckling knowingly, and 
that is exactly the problem. 

Most people simply feel that it 's 
all a part of the tension between 
males and females. What can you do 

about raging hormones, many ask? 
But such happy-go-lucky atti-

tudes breed the kind ofenvironment 
in which certain mentally unstable 
people are easily persuaded to act 
out their aggression. 

This is not to argue that we should 
all go back to the prudish days of the 
Victorian era, but there certainly is a 
need to bring back a sense of chiv-
alry and respect for the female 
gender. 

What is wrong with wanting to 
go out with a girl forthe sole purpose 
of gaining a wonderful companion? 

Getting the woman in bed should 
not be the paramount concern for 
men. 

Dignity, humanity, and simple 
decency can go along way in right-
ing many of the wrong attitudes of 
our society. And when society de-
mands these norms, the dissemina-
tors of mass culture, specifically the 
movie and music industries will give 
what the public demands. 

Our society's easy attitude about 
denigrating women cannot be toler-
ated any longer. 

For so long we have been per-
suaded to believe that such implicit 
dehumanization of women is ac-
ceptable. 

It 's time to change that, and the 
first step starts with each one of us. 
We' re supposed to be the future 
leaders of your society. 

Let's being early and support 
change now.

EXCUSES: Police Seek Reasons to Limit Student Freedom 
Continued from page 4 
attempts to conceal thei r otherw ise 
public bludgeoning of our private 
lives, making their actions more 
palatable by hiding behind such 
pathetic facades as "good con-
science" and concern forthe "safety 
of the students at this campus." 
That's the worst thing. 

No wait, the excuses are the 
second-worstthing. The real worst 
thing is that these dopes expect us 
to swallow them. 

Yeah, (cough, choke, wheeze) 
I'm sure Officer Anderson's "good 
conscience" completely cripples 
him when he worries about the 

dangerous threat 'he TGs present 
to the safety of us helpless college 
students. . 

Just so, the stalwart moral stal-
lion, John Anderson, wants to let 
us know that the only reason he 
wants to ban the TGs is that they 
are such a blazing hazard to our 
collective health. 

This, of course is to cover up 
the fact that the most important 
knee-jerk reflex response that an 
officer can spend six months de-
veloping in police academy is that 
when an officer sees somebody, 
anywhere, having fun, it must be 
stopped. 

But, then again, this assumes 
that 1he UCSD cops spent a whole 
lot of time hanging out at the acad-
emy, so it must be something else. 

Maybe what's really going on 
here is that the officers under 
Anderson have been bitching for 
years that the only time they ever 
actually have to do any real work 
is the one day of the week they 
want to skip out of work early-
Friday (or, at least, every other 
Friday). 

Perhaps Andersonjust wants to 
make sure that they never have 
any work to do at all... in the hope 
that it will quiet down the whining

The UCSD Guardian Wednesday, October 17,1990 

MACS: UCSD, unlike most UC schools, 
Has no free computers for public use 
Continued from page 1 
respectively. 

According to Jim Carruthers, director of the Uni-
versity Center, slate funds allocated for "computer-
aided instruction" go 10 the departments thaI require 
Macintoshes for instruction. 

Mary Peterson, managerofMac' s Place, added that 
since " there is no department in charge of 'student 
computing,' there is no lab for that." 

Lacking general-purpose computer laboratories, 
Mac's Place is the only place on campus with word 
proces ors anyone can use. Located in the Price Center, 
il is used by 1()()'300 students daily. 

U e of Mac' s Place costs students $5 per hour and 
25¢ per page for the use of the printer. 

Staff and other non-students are charged more, in 
order to decrease competition with off-campus com-
puting facilities. 

According to Pelerson, the University Center Board 
sets the prices for Mac's Place and subsidises its 
operating costs. Prices are "based on charges by simi-
lar operations," such as Kinko's and Zebra Copy. 
Kinko's charges $10 per hour and 95 cents per print, 
while Zebra charges $7 per hour and 50 cents per print. 
The money for the subsidies comes from the $37.50 
University Center fee that each student pays per quar-
ler.

Peterson acknowledges that "students need to have 
[the lowest-cost access possible) to computer facili · 
ties," which is why Mac's Place distributes a lot of 
discount coupons. 

She added that the lab' s "primary goal is to serve the 
students. butlhere is a fme line between being a huge 
subsidy forthe student center and being self-sufficient." 

According to Peterson, the fees are used to cut down 
the "drain on the resources ofhoth student centers." 

Carruthers agrees that there is "a question of where 
the emphasis on the fees fits ." Funding for Mac's Place 
goes to cover operating costs, which include insurance 
and maintenance for the equipment and salaries for lab 
technicians, who are there to help students with any 
problems they might have. 

According to Peterson, if the students ofUCSD want 
the same privileges as those schools, they need to speak 
out and let the administration know. Peterson added that 
"students need to get together," and voice their views to 
the Associated Students. 

While students have access to free accounts on 
UCSD's UNIX system, many students complain that 
the 'vi' text editor on the Instructional Computing 
System is difficult to use. 

Peterson explained the adminstration's view that a 
Macintosh lab is "a luxury, not a necessity, and would 
be just like buying the students a typewriter."

DYNASTY 
Continued from page 15 
rewarding as the opportunity to 
win with better athletes. 

"Making players out of them is 
the ultimate." 

"All the time and effort until 
now was to create success, now 
there's more time enjoying the 
benefits," he added. 

It may sound as if the entire 
journey has been love and roses, 
but the road has had its bumps and 
curves that left Dannevik a bit 
jarred. He says he has experienced 
every kind of emotion possible, 
including times when he could 
easily have been fired or quit. 

After the 1988 season, when 
UCSD captured its fifth title, four 
seniors wrote a leller to Judy Sweet 
e)(press ing their collective opinion 
that Dannevik should be fired. 

The same year, Dannevik made 
the difficult decision of pulling 
AU-American Laurie Bertanyi 
from the title match. She didn't 
talk to him for two years afterward, 
even though they were friends. 

Oftentimes, players si mply 
couldn't handle Dannevik's de-
manding style of coaching, and 
quit, though he admits he has mel-
lowed through the years. For years 
he stopped watching warm ups be-
cause they weren'tdoing it exactly 
how he wanted. 

"I think my mellowing IS a 
combination of maturity and pa-
tience," he explained. "I wanted to 
create a whole package to get re-
spect as not just a volleyball coach." 

"The people make me want to 
come back year after year. When 
they wrote that letter, I carne back 
to prove them wrong or that they 
just didn't understand," he said. 

Dannevik admits that he has put 
various aspects of his life on hold 
in deciding to make the program 
something to be proud of, includ-
ing never completing his college 
degree, but still thinks he"has the 
best job in the country." 

At this point in time, Dannevik 
has become one of those gurus he 
used to emulate, as others seek his 
advice, plagiarize his system of 
keywords, and copy his methods 
of logging everything in "volley-
ball diaries," 

"I can remember standing on 
the gym steps after gelling hired 
and thinking that someday 1 will 
stand here having done something 
great," Dannevik confided, 

"Every coach has a dream, and 
1 was lucky enough for mine to 
come true."

"I Won't Look Uke a 

Willi?" 
•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• T •• T 
• A French college student, a confederate flag, and an African-American photographer 

BY JAMES COLLIER 
As long as 1 have known 

him, a-fiiend -of-a-fiiend named 
Jacques has had this flag - a 
confederate flag to be exact -
on his living room wall. A nice 
little decoration for a college 
student's apartment, he 
probably figured. 

When I walked into Jacques ' 
apartment for the first time, all 
I could do was shake my head 
in disbelief as I saw this big red 
thing hanging over his couch. 

"Whoooooa," I think my 
reaction was . 

"My mom bought this flag 
in Paris, and she wanted to send 
me something American .. o. It 
was a gift, I didn' t go out and 
buy it," explainedfrere Jacqueso 

"You know," I said, "some 
people think of the Confederate 
flag as being on the same level 
as the swastika." 

I knew I felt the flag had an 
ominous symbolism ... When I 
was about 10 or 11. years old, I 
remember watching a television 
news story on a Ku Klux Klan 

protest a couple of miles south of 
where I lived, My mom had this 
look of: this clan't be hlappening in 
Southern Clali/orn;Ia, My dad was 
half-joking about going down to 
the protest and "shooting some 
crackers. " 

Later that evening, my father 
and mother told stories about 
lynchings that various family 
members had seen, And later that 
night I dreamt the Klan was 
chasing me, and I didn't get 
away. 

But I didn't tell Jacques that. 
Some people think of the 

Confederate flag as being 1m the 
same levellU the twastilta was the 
best I could come up with. 

Jacques just said, "Oh, I didn't 
know that." End of the 
conversation. 

And he didnlt take the flag off 
the wall. 

After that, I always had an 
urge to take of picture of him 
with his flag. One day, I grabbed 
my camera, went to his 
apartment, and asked if I could 
take some pictures of him with 
the flag . 

"I won't look like a Klansman 
will!?" he said with some 
concern, 

I laughed ominously, and said, 
"Maybe, but I guess you'll just 
have to trust me."

third overall this year) the team 
came at Pomona with a sudden 
rush of goals. 

Just 1:07 after returning to the 
game. freshman Jaymie Bradford 
took a Cheryl Parker comer kick 
and banged it past the diving 
Sagehen goalie. 

Pomona, not content to be down 
3-0, decided to award the Tritons 
with two indirect penalty kicks 
which Kalyn Shea and Bradford 
promptly put away to put the Tri-
tons up 5-0. 

With just over two minutes left 
in the game, Lindsay added her 
tenth goal in eight games, as she 
connected with a Bradford pass 
and hit the back of the net for the 
final Triton goal of the afternoon. 

While the game did provide 
some valuable experience for the 

team, both McManus and the team 
feel they need to work on their 
level of intensity and consistency. 

"When we decide to play, no 
one can touch us," Lindsay said. 

Indeed, no one touched Carper, 
who might better have used her 
time studying for midterm exams, 
as she stood in the goal arms 
crossed, wailingforaSagehenshot 
that would never come. 

The game also allowed the team 
to work on skills they don't nor-
mally have a chance to develop. 

"There were a lot of good things 
that came out of it. We got to set 
plays and work on our comer 
[kicksl," McManus said. 

The Tritons must now prepare 
themselves for a tough match-up 
against UC Irvine. UCSD came 
out on top in the last contesl 1-0, 
but must play confidently and ag-
gressively to do so again. 

"We've got to get our work rate 
up [for Irvinel," McManus said.

DYNASTY 
ContInued from page 15 

At times, Dannevik was so in-
novative that he was accused of 
violating rules, because UCSD was 
doing things no one had ever seen. 

"In 1983 at Wisconsin-La-
crosse, we started having the sub-
stitutes stand up during the match 
so they would pay more attention, 
and the people there told us that it 
must be illegal because no one had 
ever done it," Dannevik recalled. 

Dannevik's methods even in-
filtrated the UCSD intercollegiate 
department policy manual in the 
form of what he teasingly calls 
"DFU's" or "Doug Fuck Ups." 

"There are a huge percentage 
of things that are policy because I 
did them and considered the con-
sequences afterwards," Dannevik 
said. 

Most of those pertain to 

fundraising and recrultmg, as 
Dannevik was the firsl of UCSD's 
coaches to recruit. 

"I can remember getting ready 
to recruit, and there was no one at 
UCSD to ask," Dannevik recalled. 
"1 was scared to get on the phone ... 

Dannevik explained that UCSD 
had a reputation as "nerdsville" 
back then, and, "I was fighting that 
image with no scholarships and 
naivete." 

In attempting to acquire schol-
arship-caliber players without the 
luxury of offering money, 
Dannevik explained that, "On 
home visits, I was challenged to 
learn to tum around the idea of no 
scholarship money into a positive. 

"You have to create the atmo-
sphere of other things that will 
develop, like who her friends will 
be, who she will interact with, and 
that money doesn't make a differ-
ence compared to other factors," 
he added. 

Wednesday, October 17, 1990 

With this year's team consist-
ing of eight newcomers, Dannevik 
relied heavily on his recruiting 
abilities, and boasted that five of 
the seven players who visited 
campus wound up here , including 
starting setter Amy Banachowski, 
daughterof renowned UCLA coach 
Andy Banachowski. 

"Her dad respected me and the 
program enough to lell herthat she 
should come here. That's the ulti-
matecomplimenl," Danneviksaid. 

Dannevik considers numerous 
aspects of being at UCSD as "ul-
limates," and cites these as the 
reasons he is still running a Divi-
sion ill program after all his suc-
cess. 

"My philosophy is based on 
getting the most out of players, in 
creating success based on what 
you've got," he expressed. "De-
veloping athletes like Elizabeth Tan 
and Vikki Van Duyne is just as

Wednesday, October 17, 1990 The UCSD Guardian SPORTS 15 

By Dana Chaiken 
Sports Editor 

He wasn't even hired as the 
women's volleyball coach. 

They just needed someone to 
fill in, and who better than the 
men's coach at the time? 

• Women's volleyball Head Coach Doug Dannevik 
has built a model program. And he's done it his way. 

didn't say it, but you could look 
around the gym and say 'we're 
really good'," Dannevik said. 

In the seasons since, Dannevik 
probably hears those words echo-
ing in his head - or, more liKely, 
feels them emanating from the 
banners that hang in the gym 
broadcasting his teams ' achieve-
ments for everyone 10 see, espe-
cially the Tritons' opponents. 

Doug Dannev ik started practice 
on the first day of school in 1978 
with 15 players - and played the 
first garne that Friday with the eight 
who didn't immediately quit be-
cause of his intense coaching style. 

That same skeleton crew of eight 
finished fourth in the nation, but 
only because UCSD Athletic Di-
rector Judy Sweet let them travel 
to the AlA W National Champion-
ship because the trip to Occidental 
wouldn't be too expensive. 

"No one at UCSD at the time 
was thinking national champion-
ships," Dannevik says now, but 
explained that, "In the late 1970's, 
everyone in the department wanted 
the breakthrough to happen." 

Under Dannevik' s direction, the 
women's volleyball team was the 
first Triton program to burst into 
the spotlight, and Dannevik and 
company haven't looked back-
except to reflect on five national 
titles in nine years. 

"The success of the program is 
based on continuity, from the for-
mulating years of 1980-84," 
Dannevik said. "From then to now 
is residual from all the hard work." 

Dannevik claimed that UCSD 
wasn 'teven the best team that year, 
but in the following three years the 
Tritons were, though they didn ' t 
collecttitlenumbertwo until 1984. 

"That's one of the interesting 
things about developing a system, 
even though you're the best, that 
doesn'tensurewinning,"Dannevik 
expressed about guiding the 
emerging dynasty to two national 
runner-up finishes. 

"We were the best teams those 
years, but we got outcoached. I 
learned from that," Dannevik said. 
"I thought we did everything right 
in practice, but others planned all 
year how to beat UCSD." 

And they're still planning, de-
signing, and conniving, but few 
have found a way - UCSD is 333-
138 under Dannevik, including a 
127-18 record against Division III 
opponents. 

"UCSD sets the tone for the rest 
of Division III," La Verne Head 
Coach Jim Paschal said, being the 
leader of the team that denied the 
Tritons back-to-back titles in 1982. 

Beginning in 1978 as a 24-year-
old that "knew volleyball, but not 
how to coach," Dannevik slarted 
to piece together what now com-
prises "the system." 

Dan Cripe/Guardian File Photos 
Dannevik 's crews have consis-

tently been the trendsetters in Di-
vision lII, as they were the first to 
wear "bunhuggers," tie-dyed jer-
seys, and are still the only Division 
II or ill women's volleyball pro-
gram with an equipment sponsor. 

The first pieces of the puzzle 
were picked from the brains of 
volleyball gurus Marv Dunphy and 
Al Scates, whom Dannevik end-
lessly questioned, shadowed, and 
observed in finding out what he 
liked and disliked. 

Doug Dannevik (above) has coached 20 All-Americans, including "naturals" like Diana Klintworth 
(top), and those whom he sculpted into volleyball players, such as current star Elizabeth Tan. 

Even as a junior varsity player 
for four years at SDSU, " the coach 
told me I was a real pain because I 
was always asking questions," 
Dannevik said. "I was formulating 
my strength to be able to observe." 

Observation, which DlInnevik 
claims is an intuition you either 
have or you don't, was one of the 
keys to his leaming how to teach. 
"I couldn't coach by example be-
cause I had no skills playing; I had 

to teach by explaining." 
Those explanations became 

"the system" that every Triton, 
and even those in his P.E. classes, 
has been taught to play by. 

"Everyone does the same 
things," fonner two-time All-
American Diana Klintworth ex-
plained. " During double days 
[preseason p'ractices l, everyone 
starts at ground zero with the ba-
sics. That way, everyone knows 
what everyone else is doing; there 
are no discrepancies." 

In the same way that Klintworth 
says she is "critical when I watch a 
match because ( know where ev-

eryone is supposed to be," 
Dannevik said, "the P.E. students 
come to the matches and see the 
players doing the same things they 
learned in class." 

"The system," which is based 
on specialization, evolved out of 
the realization that UCSD student-
athletes are different, that they were 
not all-around players. 

"Once I saw the players, I cre-
ated an offensive and defensive 
style to get the mosl out of each of 
them," Dannevik said. 

"The players have to trust me as 
a coach," Dannevik feels. "I al-
ways consider players as equals,

because coaching is not a hierar-
chy, it is a democracy." 

Coaching may not be a hierar-
chy, but beginning in 1981, when 
the NCAA began sponsoring 
women's championships, Divi-
sion ill has been a hierarchy with 
UCSD as the supreme ruler. 

In 1980, with a recruiting class 
that " turned the program around," 
Dannevik began to assemble the 
cast that would reach center stage 
the next year and earn rave reviews 
for years to come. 

"That year you could sense

were a championship team. You 

The Tritons have been spon-
sored by Mizuno since 1986, the 
year they won the first of three 
consecutive national titles, after 
Dannevik personally promoted 
Mizuno sporting goods on campus. 

"At the NCAA convention, the 
Mizuno representative told me that 
he would like to sponsor us, but 
that he couldn't give us much," 
Dannevik said. "( was shocked 
when he gave me a list that added 
up to about $6,000 worth of equip-
ment."

Men's Soccer Has 
Eye on Playoffs 
By Peter Ko 
Associate Sports Editor 

With one eye cast towards the 
Jililyoffs, the UCSD men's soccer 
team headed up the coast to Loyola 
Marymount for a little Division I 
action yesterday, and came away 
with a rather easy 2-0 victory. 

The Tritons (13-2-1, ranked fifth 
in the nation and first in the west) 
took control of the game early, 
despite a bumpy field which made 
for some awkward play. 

The Lions were never really in 
the contest, according to UCSD 
Head Coach Derek Armstrong. 

"It was a chance to give every-
body a chance to play,tt he said. 

The Tritons will take a short 
break before resuming action on 
Monday against Pomona-Pitzer. 

Armstrong noted that the team's 
final two games of the season are 
now little more than a slight in-
convenience as the Tritons are al-
ready looking forward to the 
playoffs.

Women's Soccer 
Returns to Form; 
Another Shutout 
• Tritons pick up their ninth shutout of the 
season on Monday, pound Pomona-Pitzer 6-0 
By Ken Perlman 
Staff Writer 

You have to wonder what kind 
of teams the Pomona-Pitzer Sage-
hens are playing. How else could a 
team who has given up 29 goals to 
the Tritons in the last three years 
without scoring a single point post 
a 7-4- 1 record coming into 
Monday 's game? 

In fact, Triton goalie Karin 
Carper got a better workout in the 
pregame wann-up than she did in 
the game. 

Jane Fonda would not have 
approved, as the Tritons barely 
broke a sweat. UCSD Head Coach 
Brian McManus described it as, 
"essentially a practice game." 

Nevertheless, the WiD was an 
important step for the Tritons on 
the road to the NCAA Regionals in 
November. 

The Tritons (10-2-1) barely 
waited for the opening whistle 
before jumping out to a 1-0 lead on 
a Sally Weigand to Karin Lindsay 
goal, just 1: 16 into the game. 

After stealing the kickoff from 
the Sagehens, just 26 seconds later 
junior forward Cheryl Parker as-
sisted Lindsay with her second goal 
of the afternoon - her ninth of the 
season - to put UCSD up 2-0. 

From there the Tritons were 
content to let their opponents run 
themselves ragged, playing keep-
away from the Sagehens with ex-
cellent passing and ball control. 

UCSD also put the pressure on 
with numerous shots on goal, yet 
was able to connect on only six of 
21 attempts. 

With his team firmly in control, 
McManus was able to go to his 
bench without losing a step. The 
Tritons' substitutes remained in 
control, and a frustrated group of 
Sagehens failed to move the ball 
past midfield. 

Withjust 19 minutes remaining, 
McManus brought the Tritons' 
starters back into the game. Show-
ing why UCSD is the defending 
Division ill champions (and ranked

Back for a 
Rematch

I UC Irvine today 
By Peter Ko 
Associate Sports Editor 

Just when you thought it was 
safe to go back to the soccer field, 
along comes the UC Irvine Anteat-
ers. Jed Britzenhoff and Ryan Nut-

ting, however, found a couple of 
smooth spots between the holes to 
punch in the only two Triton goals. 

"We're looking to get the next 
two games out of the way, so we 
can get to the playoffs," he said.

After six consecutive mid-sea-

scored a goal or less, UCSD' s for-
tunes looked to be on the upswing. 

Volleyball Warms Up for the Big Time 
• Preview: the Tritons intend to use tonight's game against The 
Master's College as a warm-up for the Washington Invite in St. Louis 
By Peter Ko 
Associate Sports Editor 

Women 's volleyball Head 
Coach Doug Dannevik isn't really 
sure what his team will face this 
evening against The Master's Col-
lege. 

And while it's not really true 
that hedoesn 'teare, he 's not exactly 
in a panicked frenzy over the 
Mustang. 

Dannevik said earlier this week 
that he plans to u e The Master's as 
a tune-up match for the Tritons, 
beforeUCSDhead totheMidwe t 

for the prestigious Washington 
University National Invitational in 
St. Louis, which will take place 
this weekend. Much like last 
weekend's drubbing of Occidental, 
The Master's will serve as practice 
fodder for the number two ranked 
team in the nation. 

Dannevik probably could not 
have chosen a better opponent as a 
sparring paltner. Hi torically, The 
Master's has not provided much in 
the way of competition. 

The Tritons (23-6) are 2-0 life-
time again t the Mu tang , and 

have dropped only one of seven 
games in competition. 

In St. Louis, however, the Tri-
tons will face off against the top 
Division ill teams in the nation. 

Slated to appear are the number 
one team in the nation, host 
Washington University, number 
four ranked CollegeofSt. Benedict, 
No. 11 La Verne, and No. 12 Illi-
nois-Benedictine. 

Given the depth of the field, the 
winner will probably be con id-
ered the favorite for the national 
championship. 

Of more immediate concern to 
Dannevik is the health of his play-
ers, heading to St. Louis. Outside 
hitter Liz Vesanovic is apparently 
fully recovered from a back injury 
and will see some action against the 
Mustangs. 

Freshman etter Amy Bana-
chowski, however, i still bothered 
by an ankle she sprained two weeks 
ago and will again be held out. 

Freshman Julie Fabian will start 
in her place for the sixth consecu-
tive game. 

Dannevik has also made one 
other lineup change. Heather 
Holtzclaw will start ahead of Jen-
nifer Cro s at middle blocker. 

After all, down went Westmont 
and Pomona-Pitzer by a combined 
score of 9-1 . It looked like UCSD 
was about to get the playoff ma-
chine revved up. 

Just a few little, innocent warm-
up games left, and then it would be 
showtime. Not so fast. 

If Irvine has anything to say 
about it, the Tritons will not be 
allowed to put it in neutral and 
cruise into the Regionals. 

The last time Irvine faced 
UCSD, the Triton were just con-
cluding that little six-game stretch 
mentioned earlier. UCSDdefeated 
UCI 1-0 in Irvine on a Karin Lind-
say goal early in the first half. 

At the time, the win over Irvine 
(then ranked sixth in the West in 
Division I) was con idered an up-
et.
