I~ sounds like the sketch at an 
American TV show from the sixties, 
but it isn't. 

It's the plot of a show seen by 
thousands of Chinese, and by History 
Professor Paul Pickowicz this fall in 
the People's Republic of China. 

The show reveals a fundamental 
tension within China today - the 
government's willingness to tolerate 
and even encourage importation of 
some things Western, like television; 
but also the government's frustration 
with people who appear too eager to 
abandon traditions and mimic 
Western ways. 

Consumption, not revolution, is on 
the minds of the people and the 
government shares their desire to 
raise the standard of living. Free 
markets flourish with the sanction of 
the government, peasants skip work 
to bargain and speculate in the 
marketplace, students worry about 
finding good jobs and making money. 

But at the same time, dissidence is 
discouraged as severely as ever and a 
mural in a Beijing airport that depicts 
nudes is scheduled for painting over. 

Pickowicz made these and other 
observations in an interview with the 
Guardian after his fall visit to the 
mainland. Among the first delegation 
of China scholars to visi~ the People's 
Republic when it . was opened to 
foreigners in 1971, Pickowicz has been 
a frequent visitor ever since, most 
recently to the northern village of 
Wugong. There, he was one of the first 
U.S. scholars allowed to conduct 
social science research in a Chinese 
village. 

This fall, he also visited Shanghai, 
Beijing and Taiwan and confirmed an 

exchan~e program with three Chinese 
universities to allow UCSD students 
to visit the mainland this summer. 

"Consumption is what's on their 
minds," says Pickowicz. Fref 
markets, once discouraged by the -
government, are flourishing, filled 
with "literally thousands of people" 
anxious to buy items not available in 
the state market or to make a profit 
speculating. 

"I was in a car with some 
government cadres and they asked if]

market. We all got out and they 
started bargaining and buying 
things. "

Carter the cause 
Reagan the answer 
Editor: 

Once again Mr. Laura 
(GtUlrdio", Feb. 9) finds it 
necessary to open his mouth 
before turning on his brain. If 
he would look at the facts 
first instead of foaming at the 
mouth at the sight of a 
Republican, he might realize 
that, contrary to liberal 
dogma, President Reagan has 
accomplished more in three 
weeks than his buddy Mr. 
Carter did in four years. 

supplying arms to leftists in 
Nicaragua and San Salvador 
through Cuba and Libya . The 
purpose of Reagan's remarks 
was not to preclude serious 
negotiations for arms 
control, but rather to set the 
tone needed to end the one-
way detente Carter has 
watched over_ 

Tuesday, February 17. 1981 

Anybody knowledgeable in 
the art of diplomacy knows 
that one should never show 
all his cards at one. time (as 
Carter did in the Iranian 
negotiations). Tell me, Petey, 
can you honestly say that the 
host .. s would be home right 
now If Carter ha$1 been re-
elected. Obviously, the 
Iranians realized (sooner 
than you did) that a firm 
leader was finally entering 
the White House. Of course, 
one does not believe that all 
Iranians are "barbarians" ; 
but even an expert name-
caller such as yourself will 
note that all the hostages are 
home, we gave no apologies to 
Iran and not one drop of blood 
(American or Iranian) was 
shed in the final transactiOn. 

How one can be critical of 
General Haig is beyond me, 
He is by far the most qualified . 
and experienced person for 
the job. After Carter added 
new meaning to "wavering 
foreign policy" with his 
indecision over the neutron 
bomb deployment in Europe, 
it was Haig who calmed our 
allies' anger. (One will recall 
West German Chancellor 
Schmidt going out on a 
political limb to support 
Carter only to have the 
proverbial rug pulled out 
when Carter changed his 
mind.) Regardless of how one 
views Reagan's direction of 

forei~n policy, it is his 
deciSIveness that the NATO 
nations want and the Soviets 
need . 

We deserve a little thanks 

Let's stop the name calling 
and review the facts. 
Although Reagan may have 
lashed out at the Soviets 
more than you believe 
necessary, there is more than 
enough evidence to support 
his basic premise. The 
unilateral invasions of East 
Germany (1953), Hungary 
(1956), Czechoslavakia (1968) 
and Afghanistan (1979) are 
blatant acts of unprovoked 
a~ression . The Soviets 
dIrectly supported leftist 
revolutions in Angola and 
Ethiopia as well as indirectly 

The bottom line, Mr. 
Laura, is that most 
Americans are not blinded 
nearly as much as you are by 
liberal political rhetoric. The 
voters recognized that Carter 
and some of his fellow 
Democrats - McGovern, 
Church, Bayh and Culver to 
name a few - were not the 
answer to the problem, but 
rather the cause. It has been 
short -sighted , special -
interest people like you who 
speak before they think that 
have placed us in this 
economic and diplomatic 
mess; let 's hope President 
Reagan has the intestinal 
fortitude to help us out of it.

Editor: 
I am basically in agreement 

with Mr . Cook's letter 
(Guardian, Feb. 2) and was 
pleased to hear that someone 
IS interested in putting a little 
effort into some legitimate 
feedback. However, I feel that 
it's time that the problem 
was looked at from another 
point of view. -

I have been working in the 
Revelle cafeteria for nearly 
two years, God help me, and 
now hold a position as a 
student supervisor and cook. 
Thus, I am somewhat 
responsible for the condition 
of the cafeteria on my shifts, 
and consequently have heard 
all the complaints, both from 
eaters and workers . 

Admittedly there are some 
problems with the food: the 
biggest is that you people eat 
the same stuff every three 
weeks. As far as the food 
being "below par," I suggest 
that anyone try the rather 

Philosophy or rhetoric? 
Editor: 

Although trying to respond 
to Libertarian positions and 
rhetoric is like trying to 
follow Alice down the rabbit 
hole into a world where sense 
and nonsense make perfect 
substitutes for one another, 
NameÂ·Witheld ' s letter 
(Guardian , Jan . 29) was too 
fantastic to pass without 
challenge. 

Name-Witheld, like most 
, Libertarians, takes great 

pride in proclaiming what 
he/ she describes as the 
philosophical rigour of 
Libertarian position s : 
" Another difference between 
us and the Demopublicans is 
that our philosophy IS 
in ternally consistent. .. . " 
What, in fact, Libertarians 
present us with is a rhetoric 
emptied of all content - a 
rhetoric that is consistent 
precisely because it has no 
relation to the real facts of 
history or political power. 
Even more disturbing is the 
fact that Libertarian rhetoric 
is used to conceal the real 
nature of the party' political 
philosophy - the hidden 
agenda. so to speak. of the 
Libertarian program. Putting 
as ide the question of whether 
or not Name-Witheld is 
aware of thi difference. I 
pa on to orne example of 
L ibertar ia n philo ophy in 
act ion. 

During h is cam pa ign, Ed 

Clark , the Libertarian 
candidate for president, gave 
the following answers to a 
series of questions about the 
party 's position on Gay 
Rights. qark was first asked 
if he supported Gay Rights in . 
general ; in keeping with the 
party's rhetorical support of 
personal freedom, he replied 
yes. He was then asked if he 
supported the Libertarian 
position calling for the 
abolition of public schools; 
again, he rephed yes. Finally, 
he was asked if he would 
support the right of gays to 
teach in private schools, once 
the public schools had been 
abohshed ; to this he replied 
that gays, like everyone else, 
would be subject to the forces 
of the market place! This 
series of answers clearly 
illus trates the difference 
between Libertarian rhetoric 
and philosophy : while 
Libertarian rhetoric spends a 
great deal of its ener~ 
abhorring the ~overnment s 
use of "force,' Libertarian 
philosophy has no apologies 
to make about the market's 
use of force . 

Another example of thi 
difference: 

In a debate with a local 
candidate from the Liber-
tarian Par ty the question of 
property " ri~ht " came up. 
Like mo t LIbertarian , the 
p r o n I wa s debat ing 
mai ntai n d that the r ight to 

own and use private 
property, free from gOvern-
ment intervention, was a 
fundamt:n l al personal 
freedom that should not be 
abridged under any circum-
stances . When I pointed out 
that this was the same 
argument used against the 
abolition of slavery in the 
British Parliament during 
the 19th century, and when I 
asked him for a direct 
response to this fact , he ~at in 
arrogant silence - no doubt 
pondering the internal 
consistency of the Libertar-
ian position. 

Like most Libertarians, 
Name-Witheld has swal-
lowed the latest version of 
corporate ideology hook, line 
and sinker. And. like most 
Libertarians, NameÂ·Witheld 
can not 'even distinguish 
between the party) rhetoric 
and it s real political 
philosophy of unrestrained 
corporate power. Is it any 
wonder that Ed Clark is an 
anti-trust lawyer for Atlantic 
Richfield, that their vice-
presidential candidate was a 
multi -millionaire oil baron? 

Libertarian would like us 
to believe that they are the 
champi on s of personal 
freedom; they are, in fact . the 
ha rbingers of corporat e 
cont rol. Or, as my friend put 
it so aptly: they are the fir t 
party to promote greed as a 
ba ic human right. 

Aus tin Gallaher 

infamous food at Cal-Tech, or 
at the Franciscan Towers at 
UCSB, just to name a few. 
They'll make you appreciate 
Revelle. 

Unfortunately , institu -
tional food will never be as 
good as mom's home cooking, 
out even if it were we'd never 
please everyone . For 
example, in regard toadinner 
last week, two people 
suggested that the meal was 
superior to the standard fair 
- one even su~ested that 
the cook responSIble for the 
"good" food should be 
required to resign . Yet 
another comment r~rding 
the same meal was 'This is 
the worst meal I've had in mr. 
two and a half years here. ' 
How does one respond to 
these kinds of conflicting 
comments? 

Another problem brought 
out in Ron Cook 's article is 
the "us against them" 
philosophy. Unfortunately, 
this dispassion is not 
restricted to us, the dorm 
students, against them, the 
frafeteria management. 

- Instead , "them" has come to 
mean anyone who works in 
the cafeteria. It's apparent 
that in levying their wrath 
the eatt:rs uflt:n fUCKt:t that 
it's the food service workers 
- i.e., student. workers -
who must bear the brunt of 
their anger. It seems to me 
that this anger could be 

constructively redirected to 
the management which has 
the power and the responsi-
bility to deal with major 
problems. 

The article referred to 
"frustration" with the 
problems which has led to 
"small scale food fights, 
vandalism, and unbused 
trays ... " Imagine the 
frustration of the worker 
who has to clean up all that 
mess when he or she has no 
way of dealing with the root 
of the problem. Or imagine 
the discomfiture of the 
person who's trying to 
instantly cook 30 dozen ~s 
for the 200 people who ve 
shown up at noon on Sunday, 
only to get the response, 

"Don't expect me to thank 
you" from one of the 
customers in line. 

All I'm asking is for a little 
consideration. Most of us 
cafeteria workers are 
students, in fact most of us 
are even people! Perhaps the , 
people who eat at Revelle 
could consider just who 
they're hurting before they 
stick their butter pats to the 
windows, and redirect that 
energy, in a constructive 
f6rm, towards the people who 
should be able to deal with 
the major problems: the 
management.

Oregon State University President Robert MacVicar, 
chair of the WASC accreditation team, listened to a variety 
of student complaints Friday. 

Greater access to 
Regents tneetings? 

The UC Regents would be 
required to hold open 
meetings persuant to the 
state agency open meeting 
law under a bill proposed in 
the state Legislature last 
week. 

The measure. introduced 
by Ba r ry Keene , D-
Mendocino, would further 
restrict the reasons for which 
the Regents may call for a 
closed meeting and would 
encourage greater public 
access to Regents ' meetings. 

"The public has a right to 
demand the same high 
standards of openness from 
the UC Regents that it 
demands from all other state 
agencies." Keene said. 

The bill , SB 252, is bound 
to stir a controversy. At 

present, according to Keene, 
the Regents are theonly state 
agenc y exemp t from 
prov is ions of the Sta te 
Agency Open Meeting Act, 
which sets down rules under 
which state boards and 
commissions may meet. 

But the Regents havelheir 
own, more liberal law 
governing how they may 
meet, Sec. 92030 of the state 
Education Code, enacted by 
the legislature in 1969. 

That section allows the 
Regents more flexibility in 
the reasons they may call for 
a closed hearing and does not 
specifically require them to 
reveal action nor vote taken 

durin~ a closed session . 
Keene s bill would repeal that 
law.

Higher income ceiling 
for Cal Grants 
creates controversy 

BY RICK DOWER 
SaerllmenlO Corre .ponden! 

A controvers y appears brewing in 
Sacramento higher education circles in t~e 
wake of a recent decision by the Student AId 
Commission to sharply raise the famil y 
income ceiling for Cal Grant A scholarship.s, 
the state's primary college scholarshIp 
program. 

In its December meeting, the ll-member 
commission quietly voted to extend the 
income ceiling of parents' of a Cal Grant 
applicant by 20 percent , from $33.000 to 
$40,000 for first-time recipients. 

The raise is supposed to make up for the 
effects of inflation over the past several years. 

But some educators and state official are 
afraid the commission's move will m'arkedly 
change the ethnic and economic makeup of the 
pool of grant recipients, shifting it toward 
more higher-income whites at the expense of 
minorities and disadvantaged students. 

A 30-page analysis prepared by ~he 
California Post -secondary EducatIOn 
Commission (CPEC) and released last wef?k 
s trongly criticized the Student AId 
Commi ion's action. 

Because the state permits only a certain 
number of awards each year, raising the 
income ceiling to $40,000 would probably 
dump 1,200 students at the lower end of the

questioned as being a disrupt ive. rather than a

The root of their concerns, however, was 
UCSD's persistently . high. attrition. rate, 
which is among the hIghest tn the enttre UC

"The migration of undergr~uates rematns

academics of UCSO, team chaIrman Robert 
MacVicar commented at the end of his visit 
Friday. 

According to Wayne Gray, a UCSD planner 
who coordinated the team's visit, team 
members suggested that the university ~ay

Team members outlined ' their views of 
UCSD during a rushed "exit interview" with 
Chancellor Richard Atkinson and members of 
a universit~ committee that compiled a recent 
"selfÂ·study , report late Friday. 

MacVicar would not discuss his preliminary 
findings after the mee.tin~, but . no~ed 
crypt ically that UCSD IS a fasctnatmg 
institution, obviously not one that has ~ttl~

Although UCSD has r~ched near stead X:

were selling grain, something they'd 
never been allowed to do before." 
(previously, excess grain was sold to 
the state or kept by the commune.) 
"Fortune tellers were there, people 
selling medical cure-ails; it was a 
scene right out of traditional China. 

"Peasants are clearly going into the 
cities - that' a long haul (four hours 
by bus, if one is available, to the 
neare t provincial town ) -
specu lat ing, buying goods there, 
bringing then back, and selli(lg them 
at a higher price, " say Pickowicz. 

He tells the story of Li, a friend of 
his and a government cadre for 
Wugong: 

"He took me to his new home and as 
I walked through the courtyard , I saw 
this jungle of vegetables. He was 
~ow'ng them on his own land to sell 
In the free market. 

'Then he took me over to three bIg 
earthenware pots and asked me to 
look inside. They were filled with 
goldfish! He said that he was raising 
them to ell at thirty cents apiece (he 
had eighty of them). By Chinese 
standards, that's a lot of money." 

Pickowicz describes this as "small 
scale entrepenurial activity" rather 
than "capitali~m . " 

"The scale of it is petty; it come 
closer to peddling. The idea is to 
encourage peasants to produce more 
and to improve their standard of 
living." 

And it's working, maybe too 
successfully. 

Some peasants skip work to 
speculate at the market and the 
government worries that production 
may fall off as a result.

'3rd children' 
a new class 
in the PRe 
continued from page 4 

"So a fee of roughly 70 cent is 
required from each r;asant when he 
skips a Qay of work, ' Pickowicz says, 
adding that a peasant can easily earn 
more than that in onp day at the 
market. 

Two ~ears ago, a peasant like Li 
couldn t make money in the 
marketplace. He couldn' t vote in 
elections , either, until recently . 
Pickowicz says that grassroots 
elections for "very local positions in 
the People's Congress" are now held. 

"Maybe twoÂ· third s of the 
candidates will be Party members and 
the rest will have no party affiliation. 
So there's nothing like a second party 
emerging, but the people are being 
given a choice among Communists, 
which is better than no choice at alL" 

He also notes that the People's 
Congress has "no independent 
authority to make policy ," and 
essentially functions to rubber-stamp 
legislation. Representatives to the 
Congress do get special priviliges, 
though. " If they want to take a taxi 
and there's a waiting line, they go 
right to the front. " 

The universities are also allowed 
delegates to the People's Congress. 
"Of course, they nominate the goodyÂ· 
goodies from the Youth League, but 
others outside the League are 
nominated, too." 

While Pickowicz describes the 
elections as "a hopeful thing, 
something no one's opposed to," he 
says that they don't always go 
smoothly. 

"A scandal broke out at Hunan 
University when the university 
authorities realized that some 
candidates had said in their campaign 
addresses that they weren't sure that 
Marxism was correct. The authorities 
became alarmed, thinking, 'What if 
one of them gets elected?' 

"Suddenly there were student 
protests that the election was being 
rigged. The students staged a hunger

strike and sent a telegram to Beijing 
saying they wanted an investigation 
of election procedures. The upshot 
was that Beijing said to stop the 
hunger s trike and then sent an 
investigation team to the university." 

Student act ivism- -is unusual, 
though . Pickowicz believes students 
in China are pretty much like those in 
AmeriGa - "interested in jobs, not in 
political activism." 

"Right now , the status of 
intellectuals, particularly scientists, 
is very high. They know they'll have 
status - good, interesting jobs and 
certain privileges,like going abroad to 
study ('the }?innade of privilege and 
opportunity). They've got it made and 
they're optimistic. Things are going 
theIr way and they're told, 'Don't 
make waves and you'll get ahead.'" 

These students havea positive view 
of the leadership in China, says 
Pickowicz, as do most of the people. 

"Within the population at large, 
Deng Xiao-ping (viceÂ·chairman of the 
Party) and Zhao Zi-yang (the new 
premier, replacing Hua Guo-feng) are 
liked; their pOlicies are liked. The 11:0al 

of the new leadership is to increasethe 
standard of living. Who wouldn't like 
that?" 

Mao, an almost godlike figure 
during the Cultural Revolution, has 
become "the unofficial whipping 
boy," says Pickowicz. "Chou EnÂ·lai 
has become the example of a 
wonderful leader now." 

While the new leaders are liked, 
there's also a waitÂ·andÂ·see kind of 
approach. "People are giving them the 
benefit of the doubt right now. But if 
the standard of living doesn 't increase 
within the next five or so years, this 

I~dership group will feel the wrath of 
the people at large. 

"It's a very impartant moment ior 
the Communist Party. Since 1966(the 
beginning of the Cultural Revol~), 
the people have been told sua;essiveiy 
that the highest people in the. party are 
corrupt and no good. It taKes 'its toll. 
Now Hua is being condemned in very 
strong terms. The Party loses 
credibility. I don't know if the Chinese 
people could accept it somewhere five 

, years down the line if it happens 
again . There's great p~essure on the 

;5 

Communist Party, and a feeling that 
they're running out of time." 

The Party already faced a test with 
the trial of Mao's widow, Jiang Qing, 
and three other Party members who 
were accused of conspiring to 
overthrow Mao. Because Jiang Qing 
claimed that she was only following 
Mao's directives, the Party was placed 
"in a touchy position." 

"People on the street can criticize 
Mao," says Pickowicz, but the Party 
has to be careful not to damage itsown 
credibility in criticizing the founder of 
the Chinese Communist Party. 

"They're try irig to didinguish 
between the political 'mistakes' made 
by Mao during the Cultural 
Revolution and the crimes committed 
by the Gang of Four. That's a pretty 
fine distinction; they've already had to 
come down harder on Mao then they 
wanted." 

Jiang Qing's fate was another 
problem, Pickowicz explains. 

"To accuse her of all those 
monstrous crimes and not give her the 
death sentence would (have been) 
impossible. But she (was) defiant 
throughout the trial and people 
admire her for sticking to her guns. So 
to kill her, they would be creating a 
martyr." 

Pickowicz speculated before the 
verdict was delivered that Jiang and 
Zhang Chunqiao (former vice-
premier) would get the death penalty 
(that was indeed the case). But he 
believes the sentences will later be 
commuted to life in prison, "with the 
official explanation that Jiang and 
Zhang have reformed themselves." 

While the trial posed some 
difficulties for the party, longer term, 
more complex difficulties are facing 
the new leadership, like the shortage 
of lObs for high school graduates. 

'This is a bif problem and it's no 
secret. It's in al the Chinese papers," 
says Pickowicz. 

"There are a lot of unemployed; the 
high schools are graduating students 
and the urban industries can't keep up 
with it and find job> for them. 

"The government has tried to find 
WPA job> - 'make work' job> - for 
them but these kids have ambition. 
They would accept these jobs if they 
knew something better would 
eventually come alonlZ, but they can't

This feeling of hopele sness may be 
driving some of them to take up 
religion. Says Pickowicz: "J noticed a 
lot of young people congregating in 
and around the Buddhi t temples this 
time I was there. My theory is that 
every human needs a spiritual 
component in his life. For some, it is 
the revolution; that's the que t, the 
crusadt'. Mao was the spiritual leader 
and he was a meaningful thing in 
Chinese life. During the Cultural 
Revolution, Mao becomes an ' almost An outdoor barbershop.

even be sure of that, so they'd rather

He describes seeing a high school 
graduat"e selling leechee nuts to make 
a living. "He told me that every 
morning, he goes to the state market 
very early, buys the biggest, best 
leechees and then sells them at a 
higher price." 

. Bad job prospects mean dim 
marriage prospects, says Pickowicz, 
as men without jobs are not regarded 
favorably by Chinese women. . It 
contributes to "their sense of 
hopelessness about the future," a 
stark contrast to the university 
students. 

Disillusionment about job prospects 
have led to a ~neral cynicism about 
the new leadership and its policies, he 
says. "rve gone up to different people

Pickowicz cites a recent episode of 

In Search Of about the Great Wall of 
China. One reason China let the show 
be filmed, says Pickowicz, is because 
it would be "great advertisement for 
the tourist trade." (Pickowicz 
appeared on the show to answer 
questions about the history of the 
Wall.) 

Needless to say, the government 
discourages personal contact with 
foreigners. Although restrictions are 
not as tight as they were during the 
~ultural Revolution, talking with 
foreigners can still be risky, says 
Pickowicz . He considers it a 
breakthrough that he was actually 
able to stay overnight in the home of 
one of his unofficial Chinese friends. 
To do so, he had to get special

Office - "analogous to our FBI." 

But the greatest threat to Chinese 
culture is not coming from tourists or 
"hippies," says Pickowicz, but from 
the government's policy of studying 
Western technological and economic 
models. 

"They think they can separate 
Western culture ' from Western 
technology, but they're having 
problems with it. They can send, say, 
a graduate student in physics over 
here to study science but they can't 
keep him from making friends among 
Americans, from going to American 
movies, from reading the newspapers. 
A student's going to see a lot more 
than just the science laboratories." 

And there are examples that point 
to failure, says Pickowicz. "The idea 
is an old one; it was put forth by the 
Ching dynasty in the nineteenth 
century - that to survive they had to 

use Western technology but had to 
defend traditional Chinese culture. 
Obviously, the strategy failed ." 

And then there's Taiwan. 
The last time Pickowicz was there 

was ten years ago. At that time, the 
stereotypical impression of Taiwan 
was that "it was a conservative place 
- a defender of traditional Chinese 
culture. The stereotype of mainland 
China was that it assaulted tradition 

, and Confucianism." 
. . ' 

But Pickowicz's impression, after 
his visit this fall. is that "the reality is 
exactly the opposite. If there's been a 
cultural revolution, it's been in 
Taiwan. When you're in China (the 
People's ~epublic), you kno~,you'rein

modes, the way things are done. 

" I met with the ViceÂ·Minister of 
Econpmics there and raised the 
question with him of whether 
Western technology and economics 
can be separated from Western 
culture. His answer was, 'Whether 
you like it or not . we in Taiwan know 
that it can't be done.'" 

A newer concern of the People's 
Republic is the legal system, which 
Pickowicz says has "enormously 
improved ... A real effort is being made 
to adhere scrupu lously to legal codes." 

The trial of the Gang of Four is an 
example. 

"The government is using the trial 
to convey a message - that ther~ are 
legal codes and legal norms. The 
people welcome thi. Before 1978. 
there was a total absence of them." 

At the same time, the trial reveals 
the deficiencies that still exist in the 
judicial system, such as the 
presumption of guilt and the inability 
of the defense to call witnesses. 

Pickowicz warns that the trial 

shou Idn 't be viewed as an example of a 
typical trial . though, because it s been 
sensationalized. 

"It's almost like theater - it's been 
rehearsed; they have scripts. I don't 
know too many ih China who take ~t 
seriously; they're enjoying it. TIley 
like seeing the Gang of Four 
humiliated, hearing about the lives of 
the leadership." 

"More a1anning" than the Gang of 
Four trial is the go ernment 
crackdown on unofficial newspapers 
and the closing of Democracy Wall, 
two movements which were "quite 
alive and healthy" in 1979, but too 
lively for the government. 

"Deng used the Democracy Wan 
movement to his political advantal'! 
to channel discontent and rise to 
power. Bur once he got: there, he'd had 
enough, and it was announced that

New center at Scripps 
coordinates ocean studies 

A new center, charged with 
coordinating research 
programs investigating 
nearshore ocean processes, 
has been established at 
Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography. 

The new research unit, 
called the Center for Coastal 
Studies, combines under one. 
administrative structure 
several ongoin~ programs at 
Scripps involvmg interdisciÂ· 
plinary studies of the physics 
of coastal and surf zone 
waves, currents, and sand 
transport. ' 

Scientists associated with 
the center have an inter-
national reputation for their 
contributions to coastal 
planning, ocean data 
acquisition and processing, 
and concepts for coastal 
protection and sediment 
management. 

. Increased international 
research programs and the 
development 'of study 
methods for nearshore 
archaeology are two new 
thrusts at the center, 

according to Douglas Inman, 
director of the center and 
professor of oceanography at 
Scripps. 

In addition, Inman said, 
scientists in the center's 
Shore Processes Stud~ Group 
will be expanding their ro~ 
as advisors to local. state, 
federal, and international 
agencies on coastal resource 
management and procedures 
for studying coastal 
processes. 

Long-term cooperative 
research exchange programs 
are under way at the center 
with scientists from Israel, 
Egypt, and Italy, and plans 
are made for a similar 
program Â·with the People's 
Republic of China. 

Research contracts and 
grant support for the center 
come mainly from federal 
programs through the Office 
of Naval Research, the 
National Science Founda-
tion, the California Sea Grant 
College Program, and the US 
Department of State.

5,000 Fingers 
of Dr.T 

(USA, 1953) by Roy Rowland. Written by "Dr. 
Seu .. " and Alan Scott. Starring Han~ 
Conried and Tommy Rettig. 88 minutes. 
A perverse tale by Dr. Seuss. Both funny and bizarre, 
it flopped when it was released because parents were 
sure it would terrify their children. Actually, it's 
another one of those kids' movies that isn't really for 
kids. It is full of child paranoia, oedipal conflicts and 
fear, but it is also, almost unstintingly, anti Â·adult. Dr. 
T is a megalomaniacal piano teacher who imprisons 
Tommy and 499 other boys so that he'll have the 
5,000 fingers he needs for his monster piano. 

The film will be introduced by Tom Rettig, 
Tommy Rettig's son. 

State to tighten quality 
standards for law schools? 
cpntinued from page 3 
on the "exploitation" of students and the 
difficulties in periodic restructuringof the Bar 
Exam itself because of the uneven level of 
instruction. 

According to the Bar Examining 
Committee'sJohn Gorfinkel. only about one in 
10 of those who enter an unaccredited school 
become lawyer , and fewer than half who 
actually graduate ever pass the 
Bar Exam. 

'That 's a terrible waste," Gorfinkel said. 
Yet there does not seem to be much 

legislative support for Ingalls' bill. Some key 
Assembly lawmakers, such a John 
Vasconcellos, D-San Jose and Elihu Harris, D-
Oakland, say they fear such a crackdown of 
the school would further restrict acce s to a 
law degree for disadvantaged and minority 
students who are not accepted to accredited 
schools. 

''My concern is that minorities too often 
cannot get into the so-called prestigious 
schools because of the competition," said 
Harris, chairman of the Assembly Judiciary 
Committee and a graduate of UC Davis Law 
School. 

"I believeÂ·, given the continuing 
underrepresentation of minorities in 
professional schools, that they should have 
the pos ibility of getting a law degree any way 

that's open to them," he s aid . 
Gorfinkel, who compile the stati tics on 

law school admis ions for the Bar aid only 
seven percent of the total number of blacks 
and Hispanics passing the Bar in the last threeÂ· 
years had gont to unaccredited schools. '1t is 
not the number who are allowed to take the 
Bar that matters so much as the quality of 
their instruction," Gorfinkel maintained. 

Other objections to the bill have been raised 
by legislators such as Sen. Orner Rains, D-
Santa Barbara, whose district does not 
include an accredited law school, and by 
others who don't want to see the number of 
law schools that offer night c1asse reduced.

Pickowicz's concern with the 
unjus t treatment of Wei and other 
dissidents is not shared by most of the 
people in China, he admits. "The man 
in the street is not losing any sleep 
over Wei; he 's interested in his 
pocketbook." 

And if you ask that man what 
China's biggest problem is? 

"He'll say 'Population.' And he's 
right. In Shanghai, the biggest city in 
the world (with a population of 11 
million) the people shake their heads 
and say 'Too many people.' 

"I talked to a Catholic priest and I 
asked him what his position on birth 
control was. He said that wh\le he 
tried to follow Rome in everything, he 
al 0 lived in China and so he had a 
moral responsibility to support birth 
control." (Christian churches have 
gradually been reopening since 1979, 
says Pickowicz.) 

child will not be allowed to attend a 
university and may be sent to the

creating a new social class - of third 
children," speculates Pickowicz. 

This huge population is the root of 
many of China's problems, like the job 
short~es and the lack of housing, 
says Plckowicz. 

"It's connected to the politics, too. 
The Party. feels it has to control this 
population. The Chinese papers are 
full of the situation in Poland - they 
celebrate the development of the 
union, but only because it kicks the 
Soviet Union In the the teeth. The 
government" would never allow free 
unions in China. 

"PÂ·olitical theorists, even anti-
Communist theorists, say that with a 
population that large, the 
introduction of a parliamentary 
democracy would be chaotic."

The campaign for population 

control is becoming more vigorous, 
says Pickowicz, with the year 2000 a 
the target date for zero growth. "Even 
if they realize that goal, the population 
will be leveling off at something like 
1.2 billion," estimates Pickowicz.

Wei Jin-hseng, the editor of one of the 
unofficial newspapers, and charged 
him with committing counter-
revolutionary crimes -- specifically, 
for giving state secrets to foreigners 
and for publishing a counter-
revolutionary magazine . He was 
convicted and sentenced to fiftren 
years in prison. The message to the 
other intellectuals was loud and clear. 
This time I was in China, I muldn't 
find -an unofficial magazine 
anywhere. 

"It was a tremendous miscarriage 
of justice," says Pickowicz of Wei's 
trial. Although the trial was closed to 
the public, a recording was secretly 

made and Pickowicz was able to read 
the transcript. 

"The state secrets were nothing 
more than rumors that were 
circulating ~bout China's involye-
ment in Vietnam. And the magazme 
itself only raised serious questions 
about the human rights issue, but Wei 
was charged with trying to overthrow 
the government. Ironically, he was 
charged with slandering Hua." (Hua 
is now in disfavor with the Party .) 

"I asked some Party officials if they 
thought Wei was a counter-
revolutionary and no one would say 
yes. They say he is a scapegoat and 
that he was foolish to have had 
contact with foreigners ." 

China experienced enormous 
population expansion during the last 
30 years; the total number of people 
jumpled from 500 million to 1 billion, 
says Pickowicz. This was a result of 
Mao's emphasis in the late fifties on 
labor-intensive rather than capital-
intensive production. The attitude 
was "The More The Better" and 
couples were rewarded for having 
more children. "It was Mao's biggest 
mistake," says Pickowicz. 

The slogan now is "One Child Is 
Fine," and parents are penalized for 
having more than two children by 
having their salaries docked, he says. 

There are penalties for the child as 
well. Official warn that the third

Swim coach Bill Morgan sets high s tandards Cor his teams

Ex-coach Cunningham 
now PhD and NBA scout 

. 

BY BOB McSPADDEN 
Staff Writer 

Barry Cunningham was found si tting in a small office 
decorated with tokens of a career spent in sports. 

Once head basketball coach at UCSD, Cunningham left the 
post two years ago because of what he termed , "a lack of 
enthus iasm and general dissatisfaction with the sports 
program. " . 

Now, as a s taff member w ith the PE department, he is 
involved with basketball in a different way-- this t ime as a

An Invitation to 
aU UCSD Undergraduates: 

enter the Sevehth AnnuaL 

This is thefourlh in a series 
about UCSD intercollegiate 
athletics. 

BY JIM AGRONICK 
Staff Writer 

Anyone famil iar w ith 
UCS D in terco ll e gi ate 
a th le t ics wi ll n o ti ce 
something peculiar about the 
aquat ic sports - t hey are 
very successful. During the 
pa st four years, t h e 
swimming progr am has 

~ 
improved dramatically and is 
now the most successful 
sport on campus in terms of 
qualifying swimmers for 
nationals. Why has the swim 
team reached such heights 
while other intercollegiate 
programs continue to 
perform inconsistently? 

Much of t he credit has to go 
to swim coach Bill Morgan 
who has said he has to work 
around an unsupportive 
intercollegiate office. "I need 
a clearer commitment from 
the intercollegiate office," 
said Morgan. "Do they want 
lousy teams or do they want 

to make some commitment 
toward excellence? Right 
now, I honestly don 't think 
they care whether we win or 
lose." 

Women 's swim team 
. mem ber Claudia O'Brien 
fee ls tha t t he a thl etic 
department has s et its 
priorit ies in the wrong order. 
" Las t year I we!lt to meetings 
dealing with budgeting and 
pool time, and the swim team 
was always considered last 
after PE classes and 
recreation swimming." 

Despite the little financial 
support for developing strong 
intercollegiate teams , 
Morgan has done an 
admirable job. Five years ago 
the men's swim team was 
little more than a group of 
recreational swimmers who 
took a dip in the pool twice a 
week. Since then, Morgan 
ha s produced 11 All 
American swimmers, ' many 
of whom are nationally 
ranked in the current NCAA 
Division III ratings. -

Recent ly , Morga n has 
taken the helm of the 
women's team, a team that 
sent four swimmers to 
nationals last year, and will 
attempt to work his magic 
with them. 

But Morgan and hi s 
winning ways are the 

exception, not t he rule at 
UCSD. AcCording to many 
people involved with 
athletics, much of the overall 
intercollegiate quality 
s uffers from weak and 
inexperienced coaches. 

"I really resent the 
haphazard way in which 
people are hired to roach 
here," said Morgan. "Many 
of. them don't have the 
emotional capability to deal 
with the athletes, and the 
teams are shortchanged 
when they (the intercolle-
tPate office) hire somebody 
Just to hire somebody." 

Just what is Morgan doing 
that other coaches may not be 
doin~? Much of the swim 
team s success relates to his 
expectation of the athleteS. 
"Mv expectat ions of the 
athletes are higher than 
those of the average coach at 
this school. I expect a lot of 
my swimmers. I don't think 
anything is worth doing 
unless you reach your full 
potential. "

Cunningham now Sonic scout 
continued from pa/.!(Â· I I 

"A a cout on pot assignment I watch teams that are 
coming up on the Sanies ' schedule," he says. "Everything 
from the number of uccessful fast breaks to individual 
standouts must be not d. If Seatt le should know 'omet hing 
about a team or a particu lar player, it i my responsibility to 
find out about it." 

Cunningham first became seriou about basketball in 1957 
at Lewi and Clark College, where he played under coach Joe 
Brennan. When Brennan left to become head bas ket ball coach 
at Palomar Junion College.in San Marcos, he decided to take 
Barry with him. 

"Palomar was a great college and if they offered a four year 
program I probabl y would have stayed there," Cunningham 
says. A it was, the sophomore excelled both in baseba ll and 
basketball for the Comets, and was named 1959 Athlet eof the 
Year at the college . 

Former UCSD b-ball 
coach now works with pros 

He finished his undergraduate education at Cal We tern 
College, where he came to know Bob Kloppen burg. Little did 
either know that their pat hs would eros later on in t he Sonic 
organization. Kloppenberg as chief scout and Cunningham 
helping out in San Diego. 

The "Dr." was added to Barry CUilOingham following hi 
work at Brigham Young University. "My dissertation was 
based on intercollegiate sports at univers ities equal in size to 
UCSO." Many of the inadequacies of univers ity sports at 
lower division NCAA schools are outlined in the thesis. 

Although he i in his first year a a cout for the Sanies , 
Cunningham is clearly not without experience in the game. 
Upon occa ion he has had the opport~nity of scouting major 

.. 

colleg team ' wit h players ha ing t he pot ntial of going pro. 
At the recent Cabrillo CIa sic Tournament hos ted by San 
Diego State and featuring then number-on ranked DePaul , 
the . out found himself 'eated in front' of former NBA 
up rs tar Jerry We 't . A . could be expected, the two ba ketbal1 

enthusias t rarely wat ched the game but ins tead "talked 
hal]'.' most of the night. 

While coach at UC D, Cunningham realized that many 
fans and critics of basketball fail to see variou as pects of the 
game. "There i a great dea l of work and creativity that goes 
into forming a team. Team morale must be continually at a 
'high ' while maintaining di 'cipline in the game. The coach 
mu t also have a game plan worked out, which comes from 
knowing the oth r team very wel1. For Seattle, that is where I 
get the chance to help out. " 

In December, the ambitiou cout traveled to Wa hington 
where he met w ith Kloppenburg and the assistant coaches of 
Seattle. " I was honored t hat Bob picked me to help out in the 
scouti ng for Seattle." 

When a ked if he would cons ider a full -time po it ion in the 
pros. Cunningham contentedly replied, " I wou ldn ' t mind 
taking an assistant coaching job in the NBA for a couple of 
yea r , but I rea lly enjoy the academic life of the university. I 
was considered for -a coaching job with the Phillipines 
National Bas ketball Team, and that encouraged me. For now I 
would like to develop my cout ing skills and someday possibly 
be relied upon as a principal scout for an NBA team." 

As for sports at UCSD, the former coach would like to see 
the program upgraded to NCAA divi ion II from its present 
division LU level. "We have the locale and the academic 
tandards which draw fine athletes, but building a solid 
ports program here would require a great deal of both 

studenf and administrative effort," he said . 
Part of the effort can be provided by Cunningham and hi s 

di sertat ion on intercollegiate sports. As for the fas t-paced 
court game, he comments, "Ba ketball is in my blood." It 
probably always will be.

BY STEVE GOLDSTICK 
Staff Writer 

UCSD's baseball Â· team 
opened their regular season 
against Occidental College 
Friday with not so good luck. 

While there was no 
traditional first ball thrown 
out, Occidental's first batter 

Unt~Btty of ~ltfom~ santa Cruz 

wasn't thrown out either. 
Neither were the third, 

fourt h, fifth and sixth 
batters. Two of them ended 
up scoring and Occidental 
went on to win the eight 
inning game 6-3, called an 
inning early on account of 
darkness. 

But the Tiger hitting 
attack wasn't the reason the 
Tritons lost, because UCSD 
hit well , too. The turning 
point in the game came in the 
topofthefifth, when with the 
score tied at three, the 

Tritons committed four 
errors, whieh were respon-
sible for the last three 
Occidental runs. 

Despite the breakdown in 
the fifth, UCSD coach Vince 
Asker was pleased with his 
team s performance. 

"We hit the ball solidly," 
he said. "but right at people_ I 
was pleased with our 
pitching, and our heads were 
always in the game. I feel 
positive about the way we 
played today. "

Swimmers 
complete 
season 

BY JIM AGRONICK 
Sta ff Writer 

The men' swim team, 
w ho spent the past weekend 
competi ng in nort h ern 
California, finisheq their 
dual meet sea on on a high 
note by rolling past UC Davis 
and Sacramento State. The 
final team scor es were UCSD 
6O-UC Davis 35, and UCSD 
58-Sacramento 47. 

These wi n s gave the 
Tritons an undefeated dual 
meet season - a first in 
UCSD swimming hi tory. 

Contributing to the 
v ictori es were di sta nce 
swimmers Lance Halsted and 
Bob Conlin who WOR the 500 
and 1650 frees with times of 
4:56.0 and 17:07.2 respective-
ly. Tracy Strahl placed first 
in the 200 back with a 2:04.2, . 
and the 400 free relay wa 
also a winner a s Joe 
Hernandez, Doug Lee, John 
Beckley, and Greg Doyas 
clocked a 3:18.0. 

Beckley also turned in a 
fine performance in the 50 
free with a time of 22.5. 
Rounding out the day's 
performances was Mike 
Gatreau 's 2nd in the 200 fl y 
with a 2:03_ L 

The Triton women's team 
was idle during the week, but 
in recent competition more 
swimmers have qualified for 
nationals. 

Jackie van Egmond added 
her name to the national's list 
in the 1650 free. while diver 
Maureen Kavenaugh has 
scored enough points to 
qualify for the diving 
nationals. 

In addition, the 800 free 
rday of van Egmond, Sandy 
Groos, Claudia O'Brien, and 
Mary Thorsness have 
surpassed their qualifying 
standard and will also 
prepare for a strong showing 
in the AlA W Division DI 
nationals.

If any sport can be caiJed aggressive, rugby is the one. Not 
to be confused with minor contact games such as football or 
ice hockey, rugby is played with a maximum of zeal and 
collisions. The UCSD Men's team is shown here battling a 
UCLA squad last Saturday on the Muir Field. Oockwise 
from above; a loose ball is ready to be picked up by UCSD; a 
UCLA player attempting to escape; players leap for the ball ' 
in a lineout; Tim Karns of UCSD eludes an outstreched arm 
to score for the Tritons. .

Coach keys 
swim team 
successes 
continucd from Ilag(' 11 

S e nior Jeff Bennet 
reiterated this point of view. 
"Bill lays it on the line at the 
beginning of the season. 
There's a strict workout and 
meet attendance policy. If 
you don't show up. you 'reoff 
the team. He also emphasized 
keeping your grades up . 
Academics is number one. 
but swimming is close 
behind. " 

Another point in Morgan's 
favor is hi s strong rapport 
with the swimmers. "The 
main reason we're so 
successful is because we have 
an excellent coach." said 
butterflier Sandy Groos. 

"He's easy to talk to and 
very responsive about 
injuries and academic 
problems." said distance 
freestyler Bob Conlin. 

Team psychology is 
important, but a coach is not 
a coach without good athletes 
to train. Morgan relies on his 
successful recruiting 
abilities to provide him with 
these good athletes. 

"Recruiting has a bad 
connotation, but I' recruit 
differently than Division I 
schools." said Morgan. "I'm 
looking for the good students 
who want to compete in a 
quality swim program. 
They've got to be able to put 
time into classes because the 
academic pressure here can 
eat you alive." 

What does Morgan think 
about UCSD athletics? "In 
general. I think the students 
are being ripped .off. Why 
should we use reg fees to pay 
for ,teams that aren't even 
competing up to their level? I 
really love coaching at 
UCSD. but I think we can 
accomplish much more than 
we are accomplishing now." 

No 'fortune 
for Tritons 
l'unl inllcd from pal-!l' 12 

In the top ofthe first after a 
lead off triple. Triton pitcher 
Paul Schmuck bore down to 
strike out the next batter. but 
let up singles to the nextfour. . 
And before the Tritons ever 
had a chance to bat, they 
found themselves down by 
two runs. 

As anybody who has been 
there will acknowledge. it is 
never easy to rome from 
behind. 

But the Tritons did twice. 
Firs t baseman Bri a n 

Kummer led off the second 
inning with the first of his 
three singles, and then stole 
second. Mark Geiger. whoÂ· 
also had a three for four day 
followed wi th a doubleoff the 
left fie ld fe nce, coring 
Kummer. Designated hitter 
Dana Ostrom's ground ball 
sent Geiger to th ird and left 
fielder Wes Aozasa's single 
brought Geiger home. ~ 

Occidental srored a run in 
the top of the third but UCSD 
came back in the bottom of 
the inning with 'a run to tie 
the score at three. 

The fifth inning saw four 
UCSD errors rommitted . two 
on one play, and three 
'OCcidental runs come across 
the plate. Tiger pitcher Mike 
Ewing. who went the 
distance, helped his own 
cause by rollecting two of 
those th ree RBI's.

The meeting was in marked contrast to 
1976, when students staged a large rally to 
demand that accreditation be witheld from the 
university until a variety of university issues 
had been resolved . 

Students who met with the accreditation 
team this time did not recommend 
withh-olding accreditation, but n:giste~ed 
complaints in such areas as affIrmatIve 
action, tenure, retention and student access to 
univers ity committee meetings. 

Gray said the team members were "very 
impres ed by the students' r.oncerns." 

Before making a final recommendation to 
WASe; the accreditation team will further 
discuss it s preliminary findings with UCSD 
administrators to avoid basi ng decision on 
"erroneous evidence," MacVicar said.

ePEe knocks higher 
income ceiling for aid 

DOOIIIBUII 
continued from page 17 
she was given just three 
days' notice of the meeting 
and was unable to attend. 

Leroy Greene, DÂ·Sacra-
mento, who chairs the 
Assembly Education Com-
mittee, has written to Art 
Marmaduke, the director of 
the Student Aid Commission, 
to ask the ocmmission to 
reconsider its position. 

Marmaduke said it isn't 
likely the commission will 
change its collective mind 
and that any controversy 
over that vote is the result of 
a "misunderstanding" over 
the purpose of the Cal Grant 
A program. 

Marmaduke said the main 
reason the Legislature 
originally set up the Cal 
Grant A program in the 1950s 
was to stimulate enrollment 
in the state's private and 
independent colleges and 
offer a student the choice to 
attend any institution 
regardless of cost. 

"Cal Grant A was never 
meant to help students 
attend state colleges or UC," 
he said. "The Cal Grant B 
program, however, was set 
up primarily for low-income 
and minority students and 
we'd never suggest the same 
income ceilings for both 
programs, which are very 
different. " 

He called CPEC's analysis 
"faulty" and based on "an 
incorrect context,"and he 
disputed its figures on how 

many and what type ot 
students may be displaced by 
the Â· move. He said UC 
students have only been 
lucky beneficiaries of a 
program designed to aid the 
private sector. 

Marjorie Dickinson, a 
CPEC staffer who helped 
prepare the critical report, 
said the question of whether 
Cal Grant A awards are only 
supposed to benefit inde-
pendent colleges is open to 
some dispute. 

"Our view is that there are 
several pur.pose to the 
program and in the past 
we've always been able to 
achieve tho e purposes," 
Dickinson said. 

She said although Cal 
Grant B was established 
mainly to help minority 
students, the program is 
overly restrictive, requiring 
most grant recipients to 
confine their studies to 
community colleges. 

"If you're a minority 
student and you want to go 
some where besides a 
community college, you may 
not have that option," she 
said. "But withaC""GrantA 
you can go anyw here." 

The state department of 
finance has requested a 
review of the commission's 
decision since it may result in 
higher costs to the program. 
Because more of the 
predicted grant recipients are 
likely to attend the more 
expensive private colleges. 

the program could find itself 
with up to a $740,000 
shortfall, according to CPEC 
statist ics. 

CPEC also maintains that 
almost all of the students

Regents to 
to open 
meetings? 
continued from palle a. 

Donald Reidhaar, UC's 
General Counsel, said the 
Regents already respect 
most, if not all, of the 
provisions SB 252 outlines, 
though he added he has not 
yet seen a/ copy of the bill. 

"Those provisions are 
consistent with practices 
already in existence." 
Reidhaar said_ He also said he 
has "real difficulty" with any 
attempt that would require 
the Regents to announce 
votes and sensitive actions 
taken during non-personnelÂ· 
related meetings. 

Paul Rogers, UC Student 
Lobby co-director, said 
Keene's bill is an important 
first step but is not far-
reaching enough as far as 
opening the Regents to 
greater public scrutiny. 

Rogers said because of the 
complex process the Regents 
require before anyone can 
appear before them, public 
input as to how the 
university is governed is 
effectively stifled. 

"It's time the Regents 
came out of the Dark A~ 
like everyone else," Rogers 
said.

New center 
open at 
Scripps 
continued from PIllle 8 

A major project at the 
center is a multlÂ·institution-
aI , four-year study of the 
dynamics of wind-driven 
ocean currents along the 
California continental shelf. 

The program. called the 
Coastal Ocean Dynamics 
Experiment. is a $6.4 million 
investigation funded by the 
National Science Founda-
tion. According to Dr. Clinton 
Winant, progi-am coordinator 
and associate professor of 
oceanography at Scripps, a 
variety of data will be 
collected on the physical 
conditions involved in ocean 
movement. ranging from 
water and air temperatures 
to wind speed and direction, 
by moored instruments , 
floating bouys, shipboard 
observations, land -based 
stations, and aircraft.
