nine days ago that the House of

as a model of fiscal restraint. 

So imagine that just last

Some of the money was ear-

scheduled to begin . 

As a result of the settlement both 
sides agreed to nonbinding, voluntJry 
mediation in their negotiations that 
will occur on a system-wide level ~ r 
three weeks. Marty Morgenstern ,

UCSD Graduate 
Arrested for Murders 
David Arturo Medina, a graduate of Marshall 
college, pleaded not guilty to murder charges 
IY PAlllSA .MARIAN 
Staff Writer 

UCSD graduate David Arturo 
Medina has been arrested and 
charged in connection with mul-
tiple gang-related murders. 

Medina, who graduated from 
Marshall college in winter of 1998 
as a sociology major, faces the 
death penalty or life in prison 
without the possibility of parole if 
convicted. 

While local news media origi-
nally reported that Medina was a 
graduate student at UCSD, the 
registrar'S office has no record of 
Medina's enrollment after 1998. 

Medina, 23, pleaded not guilty 
to murder charges in February, as 
did alleged fellow gang members 
Ruben Bernal , 23; David Bury, 23; 

Julio Aguilar, 23; Rafael 
Hernandez, 20; and Michael 
Sierra, 19. Medina and Bernal are 
being held without bail whereas 
Bury, Aguilar, Hernandez and 
Sierra are being held at $1 million 
bail. 

San Diego homicide Lt. Ray 
Sigwalt said Medina is a docu-
mented member of a Mexican 
street gang. Sigwalt declined to 
name the gang with which 
Medina is said to be affiliated. 
Sigwalt said it is the policy of the 
department to not release the 
names of specific gangs. 

Sigwalt said there are eight 
gang-related cases in Chula Vista 
for which Medina is being inves-
tigated.

Preuss School Receives 
$40,000 Outreach Grant 
Manry will go toward providing health 
information to students via two Web sites 
Iy JOSEPH LEE 
Staff Writer 

The Preuss School and the 
UCSD Medical Center Library 
were awarded a $40,000 National 
Library of Medicine Outreach 
Grant last month. 

The grant will go toward pro-
viding Preuss school students and 
faculty with information over the 
Internet, and will also fund facul-
ty training, according to a press 
release from the university. 

The grant will be used to set 
up two Web sites, one of which 
may be partly designed by Preuss 
School students. The Web sites 
will have information that stu-
dents and faculty can access and 
use. 

Preuss School Principal Doris 

Alvarez said the Web sites will be 
integrated into the curriculum as 
a part of the Preuss School's advi-
sory classes, which also include 
tutoring, information on college 
as well as health issues. 

Alvarez said she feels the Web 
sites will be good hands-on learn-
ing tools for the students. 

Alvarez stated that the primaly 
objective of the Web sites is to 
provide students with important 
information regarding their 
health as well as the dangers of 
drugs and alcohol. 

Alvarez said the Web sites "will 
help give students more knowl-
edge about nutrition, exercise and 
sex education."

Murder: 
Medina investigated in 
other shootings 
ContInued from .,.,. 1 

"Medina has been very active for 
quite a while and very violent," 
Sigwalt said. "Therefore, witnesses 
feel reluctant to come forward. We 
have to move very carefully to protect 
their identities." 

Sigwalt said Medina was arrested 
in an unconventional manner, 
through the work of a 12-member 
agency task force. 

He said that on Jan. 29, Medina, 
who was under surveillance by the 
task force, was arrested for driving 
under the influence of alcoh I. Seized 
from his car at the time were six 
handguns, a rifle and a shotgu,n. 
Several of the weapons have been tied 
to a number of crimes dating back to 
1996, Sigwalt said. 

Police then brought Medina to 
police headquaners to pick up his 
impounded weapons, unaware that he 
was under suspicion for several mur-
ders. Medina and Bernal were then 
arrested. 

Medina and Bernal, along with 
Aguilar, Bury, Hernandez and Sierra, 
are charged in the fatal June 21, 1996 
drive-by shooting of 16-year-old 
Hector Martinez, a Hilltop H igh 
School student. Maninez was killed 
by gunfire from a car as he was walk-
ing with his 14-year-old brother and 
two friends on Jefferson Avenue near 
Sierra Way in Chula Vista. 

Medina and Bernal are also 
charged with the ovember 1999 
shooting death of 21- year-old Paul 
Truong, a documented gang member, 
and the wounding of Truong's twin, 
Peter. 

Sigwalt said Medina and Bernal 
are also being investigated in connrc-
lion with the Sept. 10 murders of 
Joshua Vasquez, 18, of Chula Vista 
and Victor Manuel Vega IV. 19, both 
of whom were gunned down III a 
drive-by shooting as they left a pany 
on Thalia Street in • estor. 

~din.1 and Bury are accused of 
wounding a pregnant woman and her 
boyfriend in a 1997 shooting inci-
dent, Sigwal t said. 

Medina's lawyer, Hodge Crabtree, 
said that his client is "a young man 
wi th lots of problems." 

Sigwalt said that when a search 
warrant was executed in Medina's 
house, police found a musical record-
II1g in which Medina talks of some of 
the crimes he allegedly committed 
with his gang. 

In a March 17 bail review hearing, 
Medll1a, Bury and Bernal appeared 
before Superior Court Judge David H. 
SllImowski. 

Before the hearing began, Rafael 
Hernandez surrendered himself to 
the court, pleaded not gui l ty to 
charges of murder and was released 
on his own recognizance. 

Judge Szumowski said the hearing 
could not begin because Aguilar and 
his lawyer were missing. 

The lawyers of Medina, Bernal and 
Bury hdve requested 2 trial separate 
from Aguilar's. 

"We want it that way; one of his 
lawyers said in response to 
Szumowski 's question of why Aguilar 
was not present. 

The police will not release infor-
mation as to whether Aguilar is coop-
erating with the police. 

Bernal's lawyer and Bury's lawyer 
made a motion to request that 
Assistant District Attorney Colin 
Murray provide addresses and phone 
numbers of the witnesses as he has 
provided to Medina's lawyer. The 
motion was granted. 

I n attendance in the courtroom 
were the families of M edina, Bury and 
Berna l as well as families of two of 
Medina's alleged victims.

UCSD Programs Ranked High 
In U.S. News Survey 

Graduate programs and professional schools 
at UCSD have been ranked among the nation's 
best in a survey released today by U.S. News & 
World Report. 

The rankings appear in the magazine's 2001 
"America's Best Graduate Schools· issue and 
guidebook, dated April 10, which will be avail-
able April 3. The survey results also will also be 
available at http://www.usnews.com.

Engineering at UCSD was ranked ninth among 
public universities and second, behind UC 
Berkeley, in the UC system. In the overall nation. 
al rankings, the Jacobs school continued its 
rapid rise, coming in 15th from 20th last year. 
Meanwhile, UCSD's department of bioengineer-
ing ranked third in the nation this year after 
Johns Hopkins University and the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 

UCSD's School of Medicine continues to be 
ranked among the top 25 medical schools in the 
nation, coming in at 23rd in this year's survey. The 
medical school's drug and alcohol abuse program 
tied with UCLA for seventh place, up from 10th 
place last year, and Its AIDS program was ranked 
eighth In the nation, the same as last year. 

The university's department of theatre and 
dance ranked third in the nation and its film pro-
gram ranked 12th. Within the diviSion of Social

gradutlte schools and programs are based on 
surveys among deans and faculty members in 
specific fields who judged each institution 's rep-
utation, surveys from professionals in the field 
outside of academia, and objective criteria, such 
as research activity, faculty resources and an 
institution's student selectivity. 

Economist t aka Case for 
Drug legalization 

.Jeffrey Miron, professor of economics at 
Boston University and an expert on the econom-
ics of drug legalization. will address the April 4 
meeting of UCSD's Economics Roundtable, 
which will be held from 7:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. at 
the UCSD Faculty Club. 

According to Miron, who has published numer-
ous articles on the economics of illegal drugs vs. 
legal drugs, the case for legalization is buttressed 
by the indisputable yet often ignored fact that drug 
prohibition does not eliminate drug markets or 
drug Use - it simply moves them underground. 

An important theme of Miron's talk will be 
that even if drug consumption is undesirable _ 
in the sense that drug consumption causes harm 
to innocent third parties - prohibition is proba-
bly the worst possible approach to addressing 
these harms. 

The UCSD Economics Roundtable, now in its 
10th year, is sponsored by the UCSD department 
of economics in coordination with UCSD Extended 
Studies and Public Programs. The purpose of the 
Roundtable, Which meets quarterly, is to provide 
top business professionalS and community leaders 
in the San Diego region with the opportunity to 
hear the views and opinions of renowned national 
experts in the fields of economics, finance, bus~ 
ness and public policy. 

The cost to attend each Roundtable is $50 
per person, or a 25 percent discount when sub-
scribing to four events. For additional informa-
tion and to make reservations for the April 4 
event, call Edle Munk at 822-0510 or e-mail 
emunk@ucsd.edu.

SchleSinger, Jr. in his book "The 
Disuniting of America.· Schlesinger is 
referring to the United States' current 
interests on the global stage, affairs and 
issues that concern the country's hege-
monic place in the world. 

As the world's sole superpower since 
the collapse of the Soviet Union, the 
United States has shined its spotlight 
globally, into every nook and cranny. By 
dOing so, the United States is attempting 

~o shape the world of the 21 st century 
Into what it views the world should be: a 
macrocosm of itself. 

The form the United States wants the 
world to take is that of a utopian society: 
more preCisely, a democratic, utopian 
world. A world where every single nation 
on the earth, from Turkey to Vietnam to 
Cuba, can hold free, democratic elections 
More i.mportantly, every economy will b~ 
capltahst, ready to help line the wallets of 
the hegemony of thi~ world, which just 
happens to be the United States. Quite an 

honora~le task the United States is taking 
on, freeing the world from communism 
and all things authoritarian and oppres-
sive, isn't it? 

It should be noted, however, that in its 
attempt to free the world from the bonds 
of oppression, the United States has 
become precisely what it feared most dur-
ing the Cold War: a powerful nation forc-

ing its beliefs and government onto other 
countries. Beyond this, the very system of 
government that this nation promotes, 
democracy, has not only stunted the nat-
ural growth of some nations, but has 
caused many of the problerns it has been 
trying to solv.e. In some cases, democracy 

~as utterly ~alled the country that tried to 
Implement It and forced it into the worst 
type ?f government possible: anarchy. 
With Its spread, democracy has destabi-
lized the very nations it was supposed to 
help. 

In Latin America, the implementation 
of a democratic government has led not 
to rich, capitalistic societies, but rather 
has resulted in oppressive governments 
wrought with corruption. With the fall of 
~he Iron C~rtain and the much-too-quick 
incorporation of democracy, Russia has 
been facing economic meltdowns and an 
ineffective government that is ruled more 
by the oligarchs than the politicians. In 

R~anda and Bosnia, democracy utterly 
failed once the authoritative rule was lift-
ed, resulting in anarchy and leading to the 
slaughter of millions. 

The preaching by the United States -
sometimes with the barrel of a gun - to 

~btain its utopia has prompted compar-
Isons to the spread of another ideology 
seve.ra.l ~undred years ago, that of 
Christianity. In Christianity's attempts to 
"c!vil.ize" ~e heathens and pagans, the 
miSSionaries and conquistadors have 
more ofte.n than not vi<;>lently disrupted 
- even Wiped out - entire nations in the

fight Against the Use of Child Soldiers u.s. Census Has Bitten Off 
More Than It Can Chew Editor: In the East African country 

Uganda, the Christian fundamen-
talist rebel group called the Lord's 
Resistance Army is composed 
almost entirely of children. Over 
the past 13 years, the army has 
abducted more than 12,000 chil-
dren from Northe.rn Uganda, forc-
ing them to become soldiers and 
slaves. Nearly all children, some as 
young as eight , are forced at gun-
point to kill other children, raid 
and loot villages and brutalize and 
murder villages. Often, these child 
soldiers are forced to kill members 
of their own families or villages. In 
addition, abducted girls are raped 
or forced into "marriages· with 
LRA commanders and held as sex-
ual slaves. 

There are more than 300,000 
children involved in wars and other 
armed conflicts throughout the 
world. Children as young as seven 
are used in combat in more than 30 
diftirent countries on nearly every 
continent. These children are often 
kidnapped from their homes and 
forced anto ·combat. If they survive, 
their experiences in training and 
combat leave them severely trau-
matized. 

The majority of child soldiers 
are used by nonstate actors. which 
are paramilitary units linked to 
governments and anned opposi-
tion groups. Children are used 
because they are easily manipulat-
ed into violence. These children are 
found on the front lines - in 
mindields ahead of troops, on sui-
cide missions, as porters, cooks, 
guards, messengers, spies and sex-
ual s1aftS. As a result, they suffa' 
from higher casualty rates than 
adult soldicrs. Even if they survive, 
their lack of education and psycho-

l~i~1 scarring leads to social 
!'eJection.

the opPOnunity to sign appeals to 
countries, send cards to Ugandan 

children recovering from their 
experiences in the LRA and learn 
more about the human rights work

Students can also appeal to 
California Senators Barbara Boxer 
and Diane Feinstein, urging them 
to ratify the Optional Protocol to 
the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child and to support S. Con. 
Res. 72. In addition, students can 
write to their meaaberofthe House 
of Rqxaentatives, urging him or 
her to support H. Con. Res. 209. 
Both of these resolutions condemn

F'mally, students are encouraged 
to write to countries that have child 
soldiers filbting in armed confticts

Despite all the resources devoted to the census, 
the results will still onry be an approximation 
., UVlNIIID 
Staff Writer 

Have you filled out your cen-
sus form yet? It's that time again 
- the U.S. Census Bureau is tak-
ing a head count of every person 
living in this country. Forms have 
been mailed to every house, 
apartment and mobile home. 
Armies of census takers are being 
sent across the country to count 
the homeless and people who 
don't bother to return their 
fonns. 

Despite all the resources, 
money and manpower the 
Census Bureau is devoting to the 
census this year, it will never get 
completely accurate results. The 
statistics it will collect will not be 
an exact portrait of the American 
population. 

rlrSt of all, counting every per-
son living in this country ~mains 
a fonnidable challenge. When the 
national census was last taken in 
1990, the Census Bureau missed 
an estimated S million people -
about 2 percent of the u.s. popu-
lation. 

Most of the people the cen-
sus missed included renters, 
migrant workers and the home-
less. These three groups of peo-
ple are essentially nomads. 
Renters move in and out of 
apartments or other properties. 
Misrant workers move from one 

~glon to another in search of 
jobs. The homeless wander the 
streets in search of food and 
shelter. Since many members of 

these groups do not have perma-
nent residences, census takers 
always h;;ve trouble tracking 
them down. Many remain 
uncounted as they wander from 
street to street, city to city or 
even state to state. 

The Census Bureau is not lik~ 
the FBI, CIA or other such kder-
al law enforcement agency with 
the resources necessary to track 
the movements of such people. 
The Census Bureau hopes it will 
get as many homeless, renters and 
migrant workers as it can. Despite 
its best efforts, it knows that some 
U.S. citizens will ultimately slip 
through its fingers. 

Secondly, the Census Bureau's 
new question on race will also 
cause problems. This is the first 
U.S. census where racial combi-
nations will be counted; people 
can mark one or more of the 
boxes representing different 
races. No longer will there be sta-
tistics on just a few racial cate-
gories, rather data will be collect-
ed on the many possible racial 
combinations. 

This question could skew the 
statistics on minority groups. The 
problem is that being a member 
of a racial group is entirely sub-
jective. Any person who is even 
remotely associated with a partic-
ular racial group can be counted 
as a member of that group. For 
example, if a person is 99 percent 
Caucasian and only one percent 
African American, he or she could

Empire: 
Democracy only hurts 
countries that are unready 
ContInued from .,... 4 
1994, all hell broke loose and the 
murder of one million people 
ensued. More recently, the break-
down of a weak democratic gov-
ernment in Sierra-Leone led to 
more ethnic strife and ultimately, 
chaos. The same applies to Pol 
Pot's Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. 
A~ Kaplan writes, "They operated 
with a fatally flawed system, which 
our own ethnocentric hubris 
helped to construct." 

As history can testify, democra-
cy, implemented too soon or too 
rashly, often leads to the rise of an 
oppressive leader. Both Hitler and 
Mussolini came to power in their 
respective coun tries through 
democratic elections. Napoleon 

~a~ . elected by his fellow French 
clvlhans to lead them into what 
they believed would be a democra-
tic future. Instead, they were 
brought under the rule of Emperor 
Napoleon and into a series of war.; 
that lasted until 1815. 

Looking at these countries. we 
cannot help but wonder where 
things went wrong. Why did 
democracy fail so miserably in these 
countries while it has been success-
ful in others like the Czech 
Republic, Greece, nations in the 
Eu~opean Union and of course, the 
Untted States, the epitome of 
democracy? 

~e answ~ has many facets. The 
first IS the penod of time in which the 
nation converts to democracy. This 
cOllve~ion is a long process - an 
evolution, some political theorists 
call it - :anging from several years to 
decades In length. The union of East 
an~ West Germany was a slow and 
patient process that has paid off. 
Even China has benefited from the 
slow conversion to democracy 
though !ts leaders would vehemently 
deny thiS faCt. The communist gov-
ernment has allowed the sale of 
industrial plants to private owners, 
something that would have been 

~nheard of 20 year.; ago. The indu-
SIO~ of Hong Kong, and the relative-
ly httle effect communism has had 
thus far on its capitalist economy, has 
only furthered China's economic 
reform. Recently, China has made a 
deal with an Australian telecommu-
nications company, NewTel, an event 
that undoubtedly caused Mao Tse-
tung to roll over in his grave. Because 
~f thes~ developmen ts, many theo-
nsts beheve that within 30 years, the 

~eople's Republic of China will 
mdeed become a republic. 

Where the United States has 
erred in its push for democracy in 
some countries is its insistence that 
e.very country become a democracy 
rtght now. As mentioned before 
this ~nversion to democracy is a~ 
evolutton. A rash implementation 
of demo~racy in a COUntry not 
ready for It can only cause turmoil. 

A second factor is the nation tak-
ing on this conversion to a democ-
~atic ~overnment. History seems to 
Identlfy two major requirements for 
a. successful democracy: a well-edu-
cated people and a larger middle 
class. Many of the countries in the 
exa!"ples above had a populace with 
a h~eracy r:ate below 25 percent. 
~lle RUSSia has a popUlation with 
a hteracy rate of 95 to 99 percent 
there is a serious lack of a middl~ 
class. This middle class comes not 
from democracy but from authori-
tattve govern ments. 

Revolution was how this country 
was established - the reason 
de~ocracy was established in this 
nation .. Despite what the Young 

R~pu~hcans on campus might be 
thll1king, I am not preaching that 
dem~cracy is a fallacy and that com-
mUl1lsm IS the government of the 
fut~re. D.emocracy, actually republi-
call1S~, IS by far the best govern-
ment In .use. My problem is how this 
edict, hke Christianity, is being 
forced down the throats of other 
nations who are not yet ready for it,

St. Pablck Effected 
Religious Persecution 
Editor: 

In college, one is expected to 
open their mind to new things 
and learn about the history of 
other cultures. In giving "props" 
to St. Patrick you have shown 
total ignorance of Irish history, 
and, as I'm sure your literature 
professors have told you before, 
you missed the metaphor. 

Those "dastardly snakes" are 
not snakes at all. Serpents are the 
symbols of the High Druids, and 
it was these Celtic priests and 
earth-worshippers whom Patrick 
and his compatriots killed, 
forcibly converted or drove out of 
their beloved Eire forever. 
"Driving the snakes out of 
Ireland" refers to the "cleansing" 
of the island by missionaries, of 
which Patrick was one. It was no 
act of heroism, but one of intoler-
ance and evangelical murder. 

I would certainly not mar St. 
Patrick's Day with mourning; it 
celebrates Irish heritage, and no 
one should stop drinking or danc-
ing because of it. 

But a college newspaper 
should know better than to give 
"props" to an act of religious 
genocide. Would it praise the 
inquisition? Or give props to 
Columbus - way to go with those 
dastardly Indians? No, it would 
have more respect. 

So drink another pint, laddies, 
and I'll have one, too. But I'll 
never toast St. Patrick, and per-
haps you should think twice 
before praising persecution and 
murder. 

Flops to the Guardian for 
knowing nothing about history. 
Maybe its editors should try to 
stay awake in class.

Census: 
Ambiguities may distort 
population demographics 
Continued from .... 15 
mark two boxes on the census 
form. 

Many people do not consider 
remote associations justification 
of membership to a racial group. 
Some will want to check off a 
particular box, even if they have 
only a small quantity of that spe-
cific heritage in their blood. A 
person who is 90 percent African 
American and 10 percent 
Caucasian is considered biracial 
to some, but African American to 
others. The point at which the 
line is drawn is essentially sub-
jective. 

Another problem with the cen-
sus is that the questions on the 
long form ask too many personal 
questions that many people will 
be reluctant to answer. Everyone 
receives the CCll$US' short form 
with questions on kX, age. race 
and relationship to the rest of the 
household because a population 
count is needtd for district appor-
tionment purposes. However, 
about one of every six households 
is mailed the long form, which 
asks additional questions on 
social, economic and housing 
characteristics. The Census 

Bureau is using statistical sam-
pling to derive tile results from 
these questions. 

One question on the long form 
asks about physical, mental and 
emotional conditions and how 
they affect daily activities. There 
are questions that ask the name of 
one's employer, what kind of bus i-
ness the employer runs and how 
many weeks and hours thc person 
worked in 1999. The questions on 
income are similar to what is on 
the 1040 federal income tax form. 
There is a question that asks 
whether the person has complete 
plumbing facilities: hot and cold 
water, bathtub or shower and a 
flush toilet. There is evcn a ques-
tion that asks if one has phone 
service. 

Many people have complained 
to their congressmen that these 
questions are too nosy. Some will 
lie or exaggerate their answers. 
Others will follow Sen . Trent 
Lott's recommendation to just 
leave the intrusive questions 
blank. Whatever happens, the data 
collected from these questions 
will be skewed. 

Another problem with the cen-
sus is how it counts college stu-
dents living away from home. 
College students are supposed to 
fill out their own forms, even if 
they are living in on-campus 
dorms or off-campus apartments. 
Many students don not consider 

OPINION 7 

their college residence as their 
permanent address and thus do 
not think they are required to 
send in a form. 

This problem is aggravated by 
the fact that census takers cannot 
possibly reach every studclll that 
does not respond before they 
move out at thc end of the semes-
ter, quarter or school year. Thus, 
the ensus will miss the many col-
lege students who do nOI COI11 -
plete its forms. 

In addition, many parcllIs of 
college students maya cidcl1lully 
put their sons or daughters on 
their forms. As a consequence, 
many college students could be 
counted twice. 

Finally, the Census Bureau 
cannot truly check the accuracy 
of every form . Many people will 
exaggerate, lie or leave answers 
blank. The Census Bureau IS not 
going to send census takers to 
every respondent to check his or 
her answers. Many people never 
get caught cheating on income 
tax forms, and it will not be any 
different with census forms. 

Keep in mind that the census 
does give a portrait of the 
American population and all its 
characteristics. However, it is real-
ly only al1 estimate. We should 
never take the rcsults at face va lue 
- the statistics will never be 100 
percent ac uratc.

have caused thousands to try to emi-
grate, quickly wearing out any wel-
come from Westem Europe. Their 
flight has created new pressure, most 
recently in Britain, to tighten regula-
tions on visas, immigration and asy-
lum, so they can be kept out. 

Those who remain face Slovakia's 
notorious treatment of Gypsies, who 
make up some 10 percent of its 5 
million population. Discrimination, 
including police mistreatment and 
beatings, has been reinforced by the 
postcommunist rise of skinheads and 
other neofascist groups who, as in .the

Members of Congress 
want to spend surplus

of other spending was pure pork 

r projects that were not in any 
rush. like the $19.4 million to 
assist the ew York lobster indus-
try, which IS suffering a tough sea-
son. 

The events of the last week 
show Just how hard it is going to 
be for Republicans, much less 
Democrats. to keep their hands 
off the projected federal surplus-
es. 

Even some Republicans were 
appalled. 

"The American people know 
the federal government spends 
too much and wastes too much: 
saiJ Rep. John Shadegg, R-Ariz., 
who voted agai nst the extra 
spending. "Tragically, on Capitol 
Hill this message is lost in the 
rush by politicians to re-elect 
themselves." 

The problems fo r Republicans 
do not stop with the House. 

Sen. Pete Domenici , R-N.M., 
who heads the Senate Budget 
Committee, laid out his tax-and-

spending plan only after weeks 
of wrangling with conservatives 
in his party who wanted less 
spending. The Senate plan 
tracks closely with the House 
version . 

The Senate committee passed 
its resolution last week only after 
Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, 
extracted a promise from Senate 
Majority Leader Trent Lott of 
Mississippi that the Senate would 
not take up a supplemental 
spending bill this year. 

But Gramm may now have 
reason to worry that his ironclad 
pledge is on the verge of crum-
bling. 

Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, 
who heads the Appropriations 
Committee, intends to push 
ahead with an emergency spend-
ing bill on Tuesday, despite Lott's 
promise to block it. 

With the lopsided House vore 
and the influential Stevens signal-
ing his defiance of his party's 
leadership, Lott suddenly was not 
sounding as unequivocal on 
Thursday night as he had earlier 
in the week. 

"I've never said, 'No, never, 
under no conditions:" Lott said, 
when asked about the prospects 
for a Senate supplemental. "It 
depends on what it is."

qualify for asylum, the Labor gov-
ernment has been under intense 
pressure to act decisively. 

Under the law, asylum seekers 
will be given vouchers 
redeemable for goods worth 
about $58 per person per week, 
instead of cash welfare benefits. 
Instead of being able to settle 
where they want, asylum seekers 
with nowhere to go will be sent to 
one of 13 designated areas 
around Britain. some far away 
from refugee support networks. 

The government has also 
pledged to speed the asylum

avenues of appeal for rejected 

"They're seeking recourse to a 
better life in this country, for eco-
nomic migrancy, and the system 
can't sustain them." Barbara Roche.

expressing the govemment's view. 

In the last few years. refugee

Admissions Officers Focus on Details 
MIDDLETOWN, Conn. -

The candidate was a high school 
senior from Florida who played 
soccer, built houses for Habitat for 
Humanity and was taking 
advanced placement courses in 
English, calculus and physics. 

Her grades were A's and B's, and 
her College Board score was 1360 
out of a possible 1600 - not bad, 
although lower than many other 
applicants' . 

But the 10 admissions officers 
from Wesleyan University, gath-
ered here on a balmy March after-
noon to hear her case, were 
focused on something else. 

They homed in on her personal 
statement, where she described a 
protraded bout with cancer in her 
junior year in which she periodically 
flew to New York for chemotherapy. 

·She was still doing soccer 

while being treated for cancer: one 
officer noted. 

"She was the captain: another 
marveled. 

"She's apologized to us for not 
having submitted a third SATI 
score.· the acting chairman. Christian 
Lanser, said in near wonder. "But 
damn it, she has Hodgkins.' 

With that, Lanser rapped his 
knuckles on the 12-foot-long 
cherry table to call the vote. 

Three arms rose to recommend 
the waiting list. Lanser and six oth-
ers voted to admit. Majority ruled; 
the Floridian was in. 

It was Day 2 of the annual rite 
of the admissions season known as 
·committee," the last round of the 
process at Wesleyan and other col-
leges, when the university'S gate-
keepers convened to consider the 
368 applications still unresolved 

for next year's freshman class. 
And while top grades and acad-

emic skills remained central to 
admission, it was often the person-
al derails that tipped the balance. 

Of the nearly 7,000 applications 
submitted to Wesleyan, in a record 
year here and at other highly selec-
tive colleges, these 368 were the 
hardest calls, for reasons as varied 
as a single failing grade, an extend-
ed absence, a borderline test score, 
or a rating of "arrogant" from an 
alumnus interviewer. 

And so, as the April 1 deadline 
for mailing decision letters to can-
didates loomed, each of the 368 
applicants received a bonus hear-
ing, before the entire committee, 
their young lives reduced to a twO-
minute highl ight reel.

Uneasy Partnership in Microsoft Case 
WASHINGTON - As the set-

tlement talks between Microsoft 
and the government foundered, so 
apparently did the relationship 
between the Department of Justice 
and the 19 state attorneys general 
who together filed antitrust suits 
against the software giant almost 
two years ago. 

Over the weekend, an official 
allied with the states complained 
that the Justice Department had 
been trying to ram through an 
inadequate settlement proposal 
without bothering to involve them. 
But a lawyer who was close to the 
talks had a different point of view, 
saying the states were "trying to 
snatch credit for sinking the talks· 
in part because ·they're tired of 
being in the back seat." 

Sunday, however, both sides 

were trying to make up, because 
they knew full well that they had 
no choice. 

"In anything this complex, there 
will be bumps along the road: said 
Tom Miller, the anomey general of 
Ipwa and head of the Microsoft task 
force for the attorneys general. 

·We've seen some bumps but we 
learned from them, and now need to 
go on and seek cooperation." 

The trial judge, Thomas 
Penfie ld Jackson, has made it clear 
to the parties that he would be 
most unhappy if they did not 
cooperate. He also told the parties 
that he expected to get just two 
remedy proposals - one from 
Microsoft, and one from the plain-
tiffs, the official added. 

That means the Justice 
Department and the states will have 

to agree quickly. At the moment, 
their views differ. Several attomeys 
general are known to favor structur-
al remedies, such as breaking up the 
company. Some others have said 
publicly that they oppose structural 
remedies. Several state officials said 
the hawks would most likely come 
around if it turned out that their 
opinions were in the minority -
which was not yet clear. 

The Justice Department, in the 
settlement talks, demonstrated a 
willingness to accept a remedy that 
merely altered conduct. 

Surprising as it may seem, 
throughout the mediation process 
the two sides have never sat down 
together and tried to work out a 
comprehensive joint proposal.

there are plans for Preuss School 
students to have a creative role in 
the designing of the site, such .as 
using students' photographs on ~t . 

Haynes also said the Web stte 
will not be limited to student use. 

"The Web site is for the stu-
dents to use for themselves and 
also to draw in their families: he 
said. "It is an outreach opportunity 
for the families to learn about how 
to get health information ." 

The grant to the Preuss School

t has a variety of names and 
comes in many shapes and 
sizes. It has been around 
since the early 1900s, but it 
has only come into the pub-

lic eye in the past decade. It is MDMA 
(methylenedioxymethamphetaminel, 
or as it is commonly referred to, 
ecstacy. . 

Once used as an appetite suppres-
sallt find later as a psychiatric drug, 
ecstacy is now widely used as a party 
drug, circulated at various venues 
such as clubs and raves. 

Ecstacy is classified as a c1ass-A 
drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 
of 1971 , making possession, supply 
or production illegal. Because of this, 
the penalties are the same as those 
for heroin, meaning that possession 
of even a minimal amount can lead 
to heavy charges. Actual sentencing 
varies depending on the local roli-
cies and the circumstances 0 the 
arrest. 
TIle 0rICI-

MDMA was developed in 1914 
and patented by a German pharma-
ceutical company as an appetite sup-
pressant. It was never sold in the open 
market due to its ·strange" side 
effects. 

The drug disappeared for nearly 
60 years before it was rediscovered in 
1970 and used as a medical drug by 
psychiatrists. Psychiatrists used the 
drug because of its ·hean openinB",~ 
effects that allow its users to bt.c:om¢. 
more social and be open to increaw 
emotional and ph}'$ii:aJ contact than 
they would norma IIy experience ,in 
their evtryday lives. 'Some peydUa. 
trists claimed that ~ dntJ, ~ 
patients to $peak more Qpen!Y dtsriftS 
therapy sessions. 

After being outlawed in 1985, the 
use of the drug turned more towiTd 
the party scene. Starting in Great 
Britain, and later moving on to the 
continent, MDMA became popular 
with both the house and techno 
music scenes. 

MDMA has been altered over the 
years and mixed with other drugs in 
an attempt to find loopholes in the 
law that banned the popular party 
drug. The result is a wide range of 
MDMA drugs that are cumntly in 
circulation . 
. ,...... 

A natural version of MDMA can 
be found in both nutmeg and oil of 
sassafras. It is a stimulant drug that 
shares many properties with LSD.

According to the Drog 
Enforcement Administration (ORA) 
section of the U.S. Department of

stimulant as well as a hallucinogenic 
drug. Users repon images when taken 
in high doses that peak for about two 
hours but residual effects can last sev-
eral hours.

The Editor's Soapbox 
A harmle s evening between friends soon turns into a vicious battle of the sexes 
By JESSICA SCHEPPMANN 
Features Editor 

I don't subscribe to the philoso-
phy that men and women are on 
opposJle tt!ams, stuck in an eternal 
battle for domination , I don't 
believe In the "War of the Sexes" 
because it creates an "us vs. them" 
mt!ntality. So the other night when 
it became clear that I was caught in 
some sort of battle between the 
"men's team" and the ·women 's 
team" in a pretty nice bar in L.A., I 
was alarmed. 

Let me set the scene. I was the 
designated driver, and my friend 
was drinking. It was her birthday, 
so I was buying the drinks, and we 
were catching up because it had 
been a while since we had last 
ta lked . We were conservatively 
dressed (not that it should matter) , 
and were engrossed in our conver-
sation. I didn't establish eye contact 
or smile at anyone, and I wasn't 
interested in being approached. 
Personally, I can buy my own 
drinks and provide my own con-
versation I don't appreciate any guy 
who presumes that I am sitting at a 
bar waiting for him to come along. 
Fine, right? Only for some reason, 
at this place, it wasn 't. 

Somewhere along the way, 
someone told guys that it is OK to 
behave like assholes when they get 
drunk. Within five minute of 
entering the place, some guy 
grabbed my bUll. I turned quickly 
and threw a punch to get his hand 
off me, but he thought it was 
funny. I thought it was disturbing 
that some guy I had never met felt 
it was OK to grab me. 

After that, two brothers who 
were probably at least 10 years too 
old for us intruded on our discus-
sion - without invitation. They 
proceeded to make inane attempts 
at conversation. We were unim-
pressed, but highly amused. Who 
did these drunk guys think they 
were? 

Then it got worse. One of them 
grabbed my friend and licked her 
forehead when he found out it was 
her birthday. The other one asked 
me to make out with him. When I 
politely turned him down, he 
offered me money. We were up to 
$50 before I had to explain to this 
bozo that my decision was not 
negotiable. 

The most disappointing thing 
about the interaction was that they 
didn't go away when we said no. To 
them, thl! fact that we were unin-
terested seemed like a starting 
point - as if we could be cajoled 
into participating in their plans. 
They didn 't leave until we pro-
fessed to be "involved" with other 
men . 

My involvement with someone 
else is no one's business but my 
own. The brothers' inquiries 
should have stopped as soon as I 
said no. It seems that a girl in a bar 
has to be involved with someone 
before her "no" will be taken seri-
ously. 

The next guy who came up to 
us seemed to think that it was OK 
to touch us. I'm not talking about a 
casual brush of the arm, either. 
This guy's pick-up line was to pet 
my arm and then purr at me. He 
then turned to my friend , put his 
hands on her hips and ground his 

The worst part wasn't 
the physical intimidation, 
though, It was the feeling 
that "I" didn 't matter. 
"I" was a set of breasts 
walking across the room, 
whose individuality was 
irrelevant, "No" merely 
meant that I was playing 
hard to get, 
pelvis into her butt. 

Pardon me for being a bit prud-
ish, but I don 't find it acceptable for 
total strangers, drunk or not, to 
grind anything into any part of my 
body. When we told this guy that 
we weren't interested, he acted 
offended and insulted, and gave us 
menacing looks. 

"Oh, you think you're pretty hot 
shit, don't you? Well I wouldn't 
want to offend you ladies. Excuse 
me." 

Excuse you? 0, I will not

excuse you. 
We were polite to everyone who 

spoke to us. Pleasant conversation 
was not entirely unwelcome from 
strangers because we were in a 
social setting, looking to be social. 
But there is a huge difference 
between talking to someone, and 
physically assaulting them. 

Rule No. 1 guys: If I feel physi-
cally intimidated or threatened by 
you, it's not a turn on. So don't 
touch me, grab me, pet me or offer 
me money to spend time with' you . 

By this point I'd had enough, 
and was ready to leave. We were 
walking out when a guy grabbed 
my arm and pulled me toward him. 
I'm 5' 3" and he was at least a foot 
taller then me. He asked my name 
and I politely told him - "Julie: 

"Julie, I just have to tell you, 
you're the prettiest little thing in 
this place: 

.Bullshit. I was wearing crappy 
clothes and standing next to what 
must have been a super model. 
Fine, you want to compliment me, 
that's great. Don't grab me though , 
and don't think it is the automatic 
key to my pants. 

My friend walked up behind me 
and told the guy that we were on

Monday, April 3, 2000 

In a matter of two hours I had 
been grabbed, groped, pawed, ver-
bally and physically assaul ted, and

men who physically dominated me. 
An exaggeration? ot really. The 
fact is that I felt threatened and my 
personal sense of safety was com-
promised. 

The worst part wasn't the phys-
ical intimidation, though . It was the 
feeling that "I" didn't matter. "I" 
was a set of breasts walking across 
the room, whose individuality was 
irrelevant. UNo" merely meant that 
I was playing hard to get. The guys 
in this bar didn't understand that 
we didn't want them to buy us 
drinks, didn 't want to dance and 
weren 't interested in upping the 
ante to become another notch in 
their bed posts. 

We were threatened and felt 
threatened. Walking out of the bar, 
my friend said it how it was. 

"That's just guys. That's the way 
they behave. To be perfe tly hon-
est, I don 't expect anything more 
from them, because if I do, I'm gen-
erally let down: 

Do you guys realize that this is 
how you are perceived? Is that OK 
with you? 

I don 't agree with this either, 
however. I know men who are rea-
sonable and pleasant, and who 
respect the fact that women are 
people too, People overgeneralize,

By JOSH CROUSE 
Associate Features Editor 

For underclassmen, it is the far-

upperclassmen , nothing can be 
more nerve-wracking. It is the real 
world , and it is coming whether 
you like it or not. College cannot 
last forever, and we will all have to 
get a job eventually. This seeming-
ly intimidating venture is not as 
bad as it seems, as the UCSD 
Career Services Center offers help 
for students. 

Throughout the year, the Career 
Services Center sponsors career 
fairs that give students a chance to 
be interviewed by real employers

these drugs, according to 

icholas Saunders, a proponent 
of ecst~cy use for spiritual 
exploration. MDEA is frequent-

I~ found i? pills sold as ecstasy, 
either on Its own or mixed with 
MDMA. 

"It lasts a slightly shoner time 
than MDMA, while MDA lasts a 
longer time and has a more 

a non addictive drug. It is usual-
ly ingested orally, but is occa-
sionally snorted in its powder 
form as well as smoked and 
injected. 

The drug's initial effects 
includes dry mouth, sweating, an 
increased heart rate and loss of 
appetite. These effects are often 
followed by feelings of serenity 
and calm ness. Users ,also report 
emotional closeness and under-
standing with people around 
them. There is also an increase in 
the sensitivity of both hearing 
and touch. 

The peak effects of the drug 
are usually felt 60 to 90 minutes

There is often a groove located 
on the back of the pill used for

MDMA may also be taken in

cautions the Poison Center at the 
University of Bonn's Web site.

According to the National 
Institute on Drug Use (NIDAl. 
MDMA is typically described as 

M D M A, 
when taken on an occasional 
basis, causes very few problems, 
report researchers at www.ecsto-
cy.org. When the drug is taken 
more frequently, one can build a 
tolerance to it and need to take a 
higher dosage to get similar 
effects, leaving oneself open to 
the potentially harmful toxic side 
effects. 

Some side effects include 
nausea, dizziness and jaw ten-
sion. When taken over an 
extended period of time, some 
users report anxiety, pan ic 
attacks, insomnia, confusion and 

e~en depressio~. Additionally, 
since MDMA Increases heart 
rate and blood pressure, it cre-
ates a greater risk to those with 
heart problems. There have also 
been links between MDMA use 
and brain damage in long-term 
users.

Ecstasy: 
MDMA shown to be

ContInued frOlll ...,. 17 

While MDMA is not classified 
as physically addictive drug, it has 
been known to cause psychological 
dependence. 

On stopping the drug, many 
users report becoming depressed 
and tired. Users may find that the 

they took the drug, one two days 
later, and the final evaluation seven 
days later. 

In the first observation at the 
dance club, all subjects reported 
positive moods, however there was 
a slight trend in the MDMA sub-
ject pool to be less sad and 
depressed than the controls. 

Only two days after the club, 
the mood of the subjects had 
changed dramatically. The 
MDMA users reported feeling sig-
nificantly more depressed, abnor-

Those who dis-

who reported that three of his sub-

tablets per weekend al.ong with var-
ious other amphetamines. 

In a study done by researchers 
at the University of East London,

department of psychology kept 
track of three groups of people, 15 
people who had taken MDMA on 
10 or more occasions, lS novice

drug on fewer than 10 occasions, 
and 15 controls who had never

The number of college students

Soapbox: 
The War of the Sexes is a 
battle for dominatian 
ContInued frOlll INIC. 12 
your daughter? 

Sex is no longer an expression 
of affection between two people or 
a pnmal act of passion. It has 
become a tool that women with-
hold to get what they want, and 
that men use as a weapon to con-
trol and dominate. This mode of 
interaction no longer refers simply 
to penile penetration. It describes 
the entire interaction between men 
and women. 

Truth be told, these guys proba-
bly w~uldn't act like that normally. 
But, It should not be OK just 
because they were drunk and in a 
bar. There were three guys sitting a 
few feet away who didn't get fon-
dled, attacked or groped by any 
women. It was a packed bar, so I 
expected to come into contact with 
some people, but despite the tight 
quarters, I didn't see any women 
rubbing against other people. It 
was o~ly.men who felt the need to 
press against every woman they 
walked by. 

To be perfectly honest, issues 
regarding women and sexuality are 
important to me. Check out the 
Disre-Guardian staff box. Jessica 
"Feminazi" Scheppmann is a nick-
name I have earned. 

However, if you look at the facts, 
you will see why these things are so 
important. Rape statistics are so 
unreasonably high that it isn't just 
sad and pathetic. It's indicative of 
an overwhelming social problem 
that needs to be addressed at the 
most basic levels. 

You see, for me to think that the 
relations between men and women 
need to be addressed isn't really 
going to accomplish anything. 
Truth be told, what I think doesn't 
really matter. I'm a little girl with 
some big oplllions. but I can't real-
ly change anything. 

But you can . 
Men have the power to rethink 

the way they view women. If you 
walk into a bar, see a girl, and want 
to talk to her, that's fine. Don 't 
talk at her, though , and don 't 
assume that she wants you to 
touch her. You have to realize that 
usually, you are physically bigger 
than she is, and that's intimidat-
ing. 

You may not intend to scare her, 
but most of the time women have 
to be constantly aware that every 
guy is a potential attacker. This is 
the culture that has been created 
by society. Assume the worst and 
hope for the best. Watch for date 
rape drugs or signs that he might 
be physically or verbally abusive, 
but hope that this person is really 
"a nice guy: 

So guys. I'm calling a truce on 
this ineffective "war: I'm asking 
you to not refer to women as a 
nice set of anything, or compare 
sexual relations to a ball game. 
Stay away from me if you think 
that sex equals a home run, or that 
buying me dinner will get you 
anywhere. 

I'll do what I can. I'll treat men 
with the respect they deserve, as my 
family members, friends, lovers and 
colleagues. And I hope that every-
one else will do the same. So now 
the ball is in your COUrl. What are 
you going to do?

U. I V"'I " uiCC 

By UreA C. IlLACK 
Tribune Media Services 

AIIea (March 21-April 19) 
You're going to be powerful 

from Monday into Wednesday. Be 
k.ind and gracious, as well as cute. 
From Wednesday through Friday, 
you could find lots of ways to 
make money. You get more suc-
cessfullater in the week, but watch 
for a minor breakdown Thursday 
night. This weekend would be 
good for taking a class or seminar . 
You'll retain what you learn pretty 
well. 

T.nI. (April 2()'May 20) 
Conditions this week push you 

to take care of business. You'll 
think of all the things that haven't 
been finished yet from Monday 
through Wednesday. Make lists! 
Around Wednesday you'll get 
stronger and more confident. 
Completing old tasks seems to do 
that. Count your money over the 
weekend. Ask for more on 
Saturday if you need it. Forget that 
on Sunday; you'd ruffle feathers. 
Catch up on your reading instead. 
Maybe you'll discover another 
source of revenue. 

....... (May 21-June 21) 
Friends and organizations are 

important to you the first part of 
this week. You might meet a new 
friend, or if you're single, you 
might find new romance. Around 
Wednesday you'll need to give 
your full attention to practical 
matters. Keep it there through 
Friday. You'll be in a playful mood 
over the weekend, so schedule 
something interesting with a per-
son you don't understand com-
pletely. 

c..cer (June 22-July 22) 
You're focusing on your career 

or some other project that's impor-
tant to you. A problem needs to be 
solved the first part of the week. Do 
the homework, and you'll find the 
answer. From Wednesday through 
Friday, you may discover some 
powerful people are on your side. 
That 's nice, but it may not keep 
you from having to do paperwork 
over the weekend. Better pay the 
bills to avoid the horrors of late 
fees! 

&..0 (July 23-Aug. 22) 
You'll be interested in travel and 

higher education from Monday 
through Wednesday. Watch out 
Wednesday evening, though . Travel 
could get complicated. Also, be 
prepared for Thursday and Friday. 
You may have to explain what 
you've been doing at work and 
why. This weekend, get together 
with frit:nds. Have fun but don't 
forget an obligation that must be 
done on Sunday. 

Vll'Ilo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22) 
You may be worried about 

money during the first part of this 
week. If you plow past your fears, 
you may be able to get a Ipan or 
grant to alleviate those concerns. 
Wednesday through Friday, travel 
should go pretty well. Study 
Thursday evening if you suspect 
there might be a quiz on Friday. 
You may get grilled by an older per-
son on Saturday, too. Don 't make 
elaborate plans on Sunday; there 
are too many problems that could 
creep in. Keep things simple for 

FEATURES 21 

best results. 
Ubi'll (Sept. 23·0ct. 23) 

You're interested in partner-
ships, legal matters and maybe 
even marriage from Monday 
through Wednesday. If you do 
form a partnership the first part of 
the week, you may have more 
money to play with on Thursday 
and Friday. Travel looks good this 
weekend, and you'll communicate 
well, too. Sunday could get com-
plicated, though. Don't stay out 
late then. 

ScorpIo (Oct. 24-Nov. 21) 
Watch your hea lth on Monday 

and Tuesday. Don't go too fast and 
smack into something. Around 
Wednesday you should get help 
from a partner, and that'll be nice. 
Your workload should be mor fun 
around Thur day or Friday. You 
could find the money you need 
over the weekend. 

s.cm-tu. (Nov. 22-Dec. 21) 
You 'll feel like a kid again from 

Monday through Wednesday. 
You'll make everybody around you 
feel like kids again, too. On 
Thursday and Friday you'll have 
to get serious. however. You may 
have to catch up on quite a bit of 
work. You 're still lucky in love, so 
things aren't too bad. You might 
even make a romantic commit-
ment this weekend - of your own 
free will! 

Caprtcom (Dec. 22-Jan. 19) 
Home and family are important 

for you on Monday and Tuesday 
especially. Make changes to your 
place and get things just the way 
you want them. Around 
Wednesday you'll feel cuddly. 
Invite your favorite person to come 
over then. You're in a party mood 
on Thursday and Friday. You may 
not feel like working until this 
week.end, but that's OK. You'll be 
able to find something to keep you 
busy. 

Aqu..tu. (Jan. 2()'Feb. 18) 
You're intelligent from Monday 

to Wednesday, so study as much as 
you can. On Thursday and Friday 
you may want to stay home and 
take care of personal ma!ters. Don't 
plan any big outings. Romance 
looks good over the weekend, espe-
cially with another intellectual type. 
Luckily, you won 't have to spend 
much money. You could run out by 
Sunday night, so don't be far from 
home. 

Place. (Feb. 19-March 20) 
You're going to look for ways 

to make money this week. On 
Monday and Tuesday you could 
come up with a brilliant scheme. 
From the middle of Wednesday 
until about Friday, study, read 
and practice. Your nerves may be 
on edge over the weekend, so 
schedule somethi ng relaxi ng. 
Don 't try anything too wild and 
crazy.

as the year goes on. Remember to 
be gentle, too. April 4: You have 
the power of 10 ordinary mortals '

self-confidence to make yourself

get sidetracked by an ego trip. 
April 6: You 're getting younger 
and better looking this year - and 
maybe wealthier, too. Start the 
process by apologizing to a friend. 
April 7: You could generate a nice 
income this year. Spend some on

keep the rest hidden away. April 8. , 
You're interested in evcrythlllg

figuring out which classes to take. 
April 9: You're a builder by nature, 
even if you don't know how. This

your ski lls - and your living con-
ditions!

When looking for a summer 
job or internship, students are 
urged to consider several differ-

student's priorities. Students 
should ask themselv~s if they

For students not ready to fully 
commit to a career, or for those 
who simply wish to gain useful job 
experience, an internship may be 
more practical than jumping into a 
career.

Web si te urges s ents to start 
their internship search early in

Some highly coveted internships 
may fill up quickly. 

Another key is to develop a 
resume that emphasizes your 
skills, as well as completing the 
application and being prepared for 
interviews. In preparing for inter-
view, students should be pre-
pared to answer questions about 
their background. 

Finally, students are reminded 
always to follow up on their inter-
views. A thank-you letter to the 
interviewer is often a good way to 
distinguish yourself from other 

interviewees.

more than quadruple the 0.5 per-
cent of studen ts who reported 
using the drug in 1994," according 
to IDA's latest Monitoring the 
Future (MTF) study. 

A 1998 NIDA-funded study by 
MTF study found that 3.6 perce nt 
of high school seniors, 3.3 percent 
of high school sophomores, and 
1.8 percent of eighth graders had 
used MDMA within the past 
years. 

In a follow up survey, IDA 
found that a group of graduates 
from each surveyed high school 
class indicated that the number of 
college students who had used 
MDMA during the past year rose 
from 0.9 percent to 2.4 percent in 
1997. The study also found that 
annual MDMA use among young 
adults rose from 0.8 percent to 2.1 
percent during the same period.

defeat was mainly a product of 
Hawaii's defense, which forced the 
Tritons into more errors than kills 
in both of those games. 

In game four the Tritons domi-

The Tritons' other two matches 
over the break were both against 
the University of Hawaii, the sixth

UCSD lost both matches, it played 
some of its best volleyball of the 
year.

said. "[ Hawaii was) sixth in

really tough. We played especially 
well in games one and four."

Softball Earns Six Victories in Florida Over Break 
In an unorthodox tournament, the Tritons show their softball power and go 6-2 during their week-long trip down south 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

Ins~ead of heading home to see 
old fnends or taking off to the 
beach to relax by the waves, the 
UCSD softball team used its time 
over spring break a little more con-
structively. UCSD was on a roll 
~oing into spring break and con-

t1n ~ed their hot streak during their 
spring road trip. 

The Tritons headed to Fort 
Meyers, Fla. to participate in a 
spnng break tournament and 
showed teams from all over the 
nation how strong West Coast soft-
ball really is. 

The tournament in Florida was 
not a usual tournament with teams 
finishing in first or second place. 
No trophies were given out. The 
tournament is a month- long event 
that brings in various schools to 
play for a week at a time during 
their spring breaks. 

"The competition was less than 
what we had seen recently: 
UCSD 'Plead COach Patti 
Gerckens said. "We just played 
exceptionally well for most of the 
tournament ." 

The 11'itons did great against a 
number of opponents they had 
never competed against, finishing 
the week 6-2. Many of the wins 
were lopsided as the Triton bats 
were hot all week. 

"We just hit the ball," Gerckens 
said. "We were hitting well and we 
outscored our opponents tremen-
dously." 

The first game of the tourna-
ment came against the University 
of Wisconsin at Whitewater. The 
Tritons smothered their opponents 
9-1 and garnered 10 hits. Leea 

Harlan picked up the win for 
UCSD and helped her own cause 
at the plate with a home run and 
three RBIs. 

The second game did not go as 
well for the Tritons as Southern 
Maine beat UCSD 4-1. Erin 
Flanigan was given the loss for 
UCSD and Harlan had another 
good game by going 2-3 with an 
RBI. 

"After the loss to Southern 
Maine, we became very focused: 
Gerckens said. "We didn't give it 
evel)'thing we had, and we learned 
from that.· 

With a new focus, the Triton 
bats came alive to beat Bethel 
Coll ege 8-3 . Erin Flanigan 
rebounded from her previous 
loss and picked up the win and 
Harlan launched her second 
home run of the tournament and 
drove in two runs. Also for 
UCSD, Kristina Anderson went 
2-3 with a triple and Natalie 
Arcade, Jeanine Cordero and 
Cynthia Sam also all went 2-3 
from the plate. 

The Tritons continued their hot 
bats against Eastern Nazarene as 
they won 7-0 with 11 hits. Erin 

Flani~an picked up the win. 
Natalie Andrade, Erin Bridges and 
Cordero all went 2-4 and Hannon 
was 2-3. 

The Tritons appeared unstop-
pable against Bethel University as 
they won 14-4 and had 15 hits. 
Stacey Bolaris got the win and 
Samantha Hayes was the one of 
many offensive stars as she went 2-
3, driving in three runs and scoring 
three times.

Bill Burger 

. NCAA Shockers 
Due to NBA Draft 

After two weeks of competi-
tion, the field of 64 has been nar-
rowed down to two. For all of you 
who had Michigan State defeat-
ing Wisconsin and Florida 
defeating orth Carolina in the 
Final Four - well, none of you 
really chose that. It has long been 
said that the only way that you 
can choose every game correctly 
is if you don't know anything 
about basketball. 

Never was this more true than 
this year when two o. 1 seeds fell 
in the second round and a third in 
the Sweet 16. Never before has a 
team with 13 losses been in the 
Final Four; this year there were 
two (Wisconsin and forth 
Carolina). 

Why is all of this happening? 
The experts say it is parity, but 
they don 't explain the cause of 
the parity. The cause is the early 
entries into the NBA draft . With 
all the best players leaving college 
after their freshman and sopho-
more seasons, the college ranks 
are left with only mediocre senior 
performers and underdeveloped 
underclassmen. 

The worst things that ever 
happened to the NCAA were 
Kobe Bryant and Kevin Garnett. 
Because of their successes in 
jumping from high school to the 

BA, every athlete with any 
amount of talent thinks they can 
do the same thing. 

This year's tournament was a 
great example of this problem. 
With the exception of outstanding 
performances by Stromile Swift of 
LSU and Marcus Fizer of Iowa 
State, this tournament lacked tht> 
star power of yesteryear. 

Young players jumping to the 
BA are not only hurting the col-

lege ranks, they are also hurting 
the BA. 

By luring tht>ir top prospects 
before they are ready, the NBA is 
lowering the potential of these 
players and ensuring that they 
don't mature into the professional 
players that they could be. 

Many freshmen are drafted late 
in the first round or early in the 
second round and then sit on the 
end of the bench for their NBA 
teams while they could be the stars 
of their college teams. 

Without getting the experi -
ence they need, these players usu-
ally just waste into obscurity 
without ever coming close to 
becoming the players they were 
expected to be. 

So how does this affect the 
game tonight? Both teams have 
talent unusual for this day and 
age. Florida is 12 players deep 
and most of those players are 
freshmen and sophomores. 
Michigan State is led by two AII-
Americans in Mateen Cleaves 
and Mo Peterson and also has 
good depth . 

I predict that Florida's depth 
and athleticism will put Michigan 
State down early, and this time the 
Spartans won't have enough to 
come back like they did in previ-
ous games in the tournament. 
Michigan State will rally in the end 
but it will not be enough to over-
come its early deficit. 

Florida 78, Michigan State 72. 
These teams better enjoy tht: 

success now because next year all 
of their stars will be in the NBA.

PORTS 
Volleyball Takes Out NYU 
The Tritons nearly upset Hawaii University and secure a spot in the NCAA Division III Toum(lment 

Iy IIU BURGER 
Sports Editor 

Over spring break, when the sun was beat-
ing down on the beaches of La Jolla, most of us 
were lounging around 
on the sand or in the .Mlp... ...... 4I.. 
water reveling 
the fact 
that there 
was no 
school for a week. 
The men's volleyball 
team experienced no such luxury as it had 
three games over the break, winning one and 
losing two. 

In the first game, UCSD took on ew York 
University. The opponents were ranked No. 3 
in the nation in Division 111, so the Tritons were 
expecting a tough contest as they tried to 
uphold their top rank in that division. NYU 
came out tough and looked like it might run 
away with the match, but the Tritons fought 
back and won in four games. 

In the first game the Tritons were manhan-
dled by the visitors. Everything NYU hit went 
down for the kill and UCSD could not coordi-
nate any kind of defensive scheme to stop it. 
The game ended with UCS D losing 15-8. 

"We started off slow and didn't play well in 
the first game: Head Coach Ron Larsen said. 
"They did some nice things, but I think we 
adapted well: 

The Tritons could manage only 13 kills in 
the first game and had nine hitting errors while 
NYU had 19 kills and only four hitting errors. 
It was certainly an auspicious beginning. 

The Tritons were also slightly sluggish in 
the second game, but they did enough to win 
the game 16-14. 

"I didn't think we played all that well in the 
second game: Larsen said . "We just played a 
little bit better then they did: 

The Tritons' defense is what rallied them to 
victory in the second game, as they held their 
opponents to 11 kills while making them com-
mit 12 hitting errors. UCSD improved its hit-
ting percen tage from .114 in the first game to 
.163 in the second game but was certainly not 
playing its best offensively.

Swimming Has Stellar Meet 
at National Championships 
The women take third and the men fourth at 
the season's culminating event 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD swimming and 
diving team finished the 1999-
2000 season in prime form at the 
NCAA Division III 
Championships last month. 

Both the men and women had 
stellar performances. The women 
finished third in the nation and 
the men grabbed fourth . 

On the women's side, a score a 
355.5 earned the Tritons third 
place. Kenyon College took first 
by a large margin with 619.5 
points, winning its 17th champi-
onship In. a row. Denison took 
second with 417.5. 

"We accomplished some of 
our goals: UCSD Head Coach 
Scott McGihon said. ·We broke 
some school records. All in all, it 
was a good weekend for the 
women: 

UCSD's Jennifer Watanabe 
was the story of the meet. The 
freshman tore up the pool with 

four championships, the most 
ever won by a Triton. She was also 
named Outstanding Swimmer of 
the meet and led all individual 
scorers with 60 points. 

Watanabe grabbed the 200-yard 
backstroke in a time of 2:03.30, 
shattering UCSD's record. 

Watanabe also took the 400-
yard individual medley with a 
UCSD record time of 4:27.28. She 
also grabbed the SOO-yard freestyle. 

Watanabe anchored the 800-
yard freestyle relay with team-
mates Sharon Smith, Amanda 
Gurnee and Samantha Wong in 
winning the event in a time of 
7:37. 

Gurnee finished 13th overall 
in individual point scoring with 
36.5, and Wong placed 22nd with 
31 points. 

On the men's side, the Tritons 
took fourth with 283 points. As 
with the women, it was again 
Kenyon who dominated the mr-:e t,
