A scientific approach: 

Editor: 
What is wrong with "The 

Sun God"? I am puzzled why 
the managing editor of the 
Guardian (I guess a ll those 
unruly editors do need a little 
management) would write a 
defenseless article condemn· 
ing this prime example of de 
St. Phalle·ie seul pture. If one is 
to believe Mr, Farwell, there 
are the beginnings of an 
insidious plot here at UCSD. 

· · I· k t ·11 .. This plot sounds suspi· mlsslng In S S l mlsslng ciously like the old Domino 
Editor: 

The letter "Thecaseagainst 
religion - st riking out at the 
validity of the Bible" (Feb. 3) 
has already sparked four 
re ponse !Feb, ]0 and Feb. 
14). Here are more comments: 

Not all people were taught 
that their religion "should not 
be quest ioned." I was not. and 
many others were not. In fact 
C.S, Lewis. ca lled "the most 
popular ChristIan theologian 
being published tocla). " wrote. 
"I am not askll1g anyone to 
accept Chnstianity if hi s best 
reasoning tells him that the 
weight of t he evidence is 
agai nst it." (.'1£'1'(' Christian it\'. 
p ]23) " 

Serious. Bible·believing 
thll1kers do eXIst (see Charies 
Mador's letter in Feb. 1O's 
Guardian). 

J. Johnson also ment Ions 
e\olutlon as dlspro\'lng man's 
creal Ion. He. like others. \'iews 
evolution as a fact But this 
"fact" has ,.,erious flaw~. What 
follows are \er\ few of the 
many problem" evolutIon ha". 
more re~earch is needed to 
make a final decision for 
yourself 

Evolution ha ... not and 
cannot he pro\'l'n b\' t hl' 

scientific method (observation 
and experimentation ) No 
observer witnessed evolution 
in the past and the long time 
intervals needed by evolution 
prevent it s observation 111 the 
present and make experi· 
mentation diff ic ult (t he 
experimenters would not li\e 
long enough). 

The "big bang" contradicts 
the eeond Law of Thermo· 
dynam iCs (a ll system.;; tend 
toward disorder. or ent ropy 
increases). The big bang needs 
a "cosmic egg" (a ll matter and 
energy in one place) of a high 
order to explode and then for 
the result ing dl<;ordered gas to 
order itself Into the pre"ellt 
unl\ er~e. 

-rhe "~tead) state" Idea 
contradicts the First La\', of 
Thermodj nall11C,., (not hlllg IS 
nO\\ being "created" or 
destroyed). The stead,' :-;tate 
needs inatter to be cont"inuall\' 
.. nea led" someII' here t II of fst;1 
the 2nd Law. 

For a s\'stem to grow III

energy pouring in (Open 
System Therm(xi\ namics) it 
needs t\\'o things: i l a program

Art is not 
a static 
medium 
Editor: 

fhis is written in response 
to th e letter of Thursd<lY, 
February ] 7 by Gregory 
Chapelle. Although art is not, 
II1deed a static medium. the 
d ..: finiti on of the word 

eyeso re " is s tatIc; its 
me<lning does not cha nge from 
one edition of Webster'~ 
Dict ionary to t he next. We 
agree that there eXist several 
narrow·mll1ded people 111 our 
world. We. howel'Cr, refuse to 
accept the Sun God as art nm 
because it is new or different. 
but because it is ugly. [)oes 
Gregory Chapclle mean to 
assert t hat if one does not 
appreciate the Sun God. then 
one is not mature? If onl\ 
"maturl''' pe ople can 
appreciate the Sun God. then 
perhaps only they ,,11t)uld be 
permitted to view It For thi., 
reason Wi' feel the Sun God 
should not be si tuated on our 
campus.

Theory of Austerity, or DTA. 
The results of the DTA, first 
discussed in a treati e entitled 
The justice 0/ Austerity by 
Mhos van der Rohe over thirty 
yea rs ago, are nothing les 
than the ruin of Society As We 
Know It Today. Van der Rohe 
warns that unless the sanctity 
of modern architecture is 
preserved. grassy knolls will 
soon be violated and any 
beautifully austere insti tu · 
tions will be reduced to "mere 
objects of curiosity." Perish 
the thought! I am s urprised we 
haven't heard from the SPCE 
(Society for t he Prevent ion of 
Cruelty to Engineers) yet. 

All jesting aside (well maybe 
not all). how can one seriously 
offer the art and architecture 
of the UCSD campus as a 
standard of excellence? Say it 
ain't so, joe (e r ... Paul). You 
weren't being serious, were 
you? Yes. "The Sun God" is 
u tterl} incongruous. This is 
readily apparen t to most 
people who observe the work. 
but Mr Farwell thinks the 
location unfortunate - "its 
impact ... eem!'. lost somehO\\." 
The scu l(.)t ure IS oearly m the 
heart of the concrete Jungle 
and I cannot thmk of another 
place where it \\oi.lld have 
111 ore 1111 pact. 

I must agree with MI. 
Farwell that thpre is "nothing 
\\rong. of courSL'. With 
huildings which Serl'l' a 
function and arc beautiful at 
the same time," Rut r 
challenge him to find one 
\\ hich fih thc'ie CriterIa It 
seems that functIOn, likt" 
beauty. I" It1 the eye of the 
beholder. Central Libran' vou 
say? Well . yes. if It s fUncli()n IS 
to pro\ ide a n ict' backdrop for 
fdming " Buck Rogers" and the 
lead·in to "Simon and Simon" 
- it"" pt'rfect. But as a plan' to 
s tudy. and to store. pre ... erve. 
and d Ispers(' books I t I~ 
perhaps a "C ". The Central 
Librarv is incomenientl\, 
loca ted and has massl\ (. 
heating /ccKJling costs becClu ... e 

of all the poorly insulated glass 
walls. Ultraviolet light 
pervades all of the sides 
causing premature fading of 
books. and there are precious 
few places to s tudy. One 
cannot reach the majority of 
the stacks without climbing at 
leasl four flights of stairs 
(which most don 't do) and thus 
the two elevators are 
hopelessly overused . 

Is the austere, gray concrele 
of Muir and the austere. white 
plaster of Revelle and Third 
really beautiful? Is austerity 
reall ywha t expresses the 
"character" of the University? 
(A trite phrase, but as James 
Ralph Papp i~ wont to say, it 
occurred to me at the t ime.) Is 
LJCS[)'s architecture some· 
thing that needs to be defendf'd 
aga inst a rather humorous 
piece of brighlly paint ed 
fiberglass? RI IT NOOOOOI 
Spend a few minutes lookmg 
at "The Sun God" The wings 
are III a remarkably friendly 
ge ... t ure. Its hrigh t colors and 
fetching posture are at least a 
sorely ne('d~-d break from the 
drab Impersonal concrete 
sla b~ that compris(-' most of the 
campus architect ure 

At any rate , why does Mr. 
Farwell think the campus 
"hould not be a "forum for 
art 1st 1(' expennwnt at IOn "? I

America on the decline Absent missing links 
continued from page 3 

It em 3: US military 
superiority has been gravely 
challenged by an absolutely 
huge Soviet buildup. The 
Soviets have more of just 
about everything and more 
importantly the quality of 
their weapons rivals our own. 
No longer can the US be smug 
in "technological superiority." 
Often the US military has 
planned to counter the Soviets 
with technological "magic." 
The result has been small 
numbers of cost ly , over· 
sophisticated weaspons with 
questionable reliabilit y. To a 
large extent the improvement 
in Soviet technology i the 
result of outright theft from 
the US. Regardless of the 
means, the result is t hat the 
US can no longer challenge the 
Ru ss ian s with relati\'e 
Impunity. 

/frill 4: The economy. What 
can I say! The crisis fill s the 
media daily. Over ten percent 
unemplo yed with mind· 
boggling defi ci ts . Clearly 
President Reagan's hope for an

invigorated economy as a 
result from lowered taxes has 
not materialized. In retrospect 
it's easy to see that the deficit 
would not shrink with lowered 
taxes and sharply increased 
defense spe nding . The 
"gamble" has not worked. 
De pite sporadic tock market 
activity and hopeful govern-
ment predictions, the boom is 
not here yet, it may never 
arrive. After all. the US is 
experiencing a traumatic hift 
from an industrially-ba ed toa 
ervice· ba ed economy. The 

jobs lost today in heavy 
industries uch as auto and 
steel may never be reclaimed. 
The result is an obsolete work 
force wandering around the 
country for work, food, and 
shelter. Their pro 'peets are 
grim. Labor intensive industry 
continue to be exported 
abroad to far cheaper foreign 
workers. American labor mu~t 
lower wages to become 
competitive with world 
supply. Laborunionsa reat the 
heart of the problem. [f major

Item 5: The social fabric of 
America is al so being ripped. 
High divorce rates and the 
growth of fanatical religious 
elements are indicative of lack 
of stability in the family . To 
ome extent thi s i ' the re ult 

of a progressive culture. 
however a strong family unit 
is neccessary to maintain a 
healthy and emotionally 
ecure populace. 
Some of the e items of decay 

reflect the fall of ancient 
Rome. However the parallel 
should not be drawn too far. I 
have faith in America. More 
than any other nation before 
it, the USA has championed 
human freedom and security 
for its people, as well as other. 
The underlying st rength of 
this count ry relies on its 
fo undation. the Constit ut ion. 
The decline of this countrv 
need not continue and the 
prospects for growth are good. 
To accomplish this growth

thesis; the evolution of life 
does not. 

The probability of life 
happening by chance given 
ridiculously lenient condi-
tions. is I chance in 10167626 (a 
one followed by 167,626 zeros, 
one chance in that). James H. 
Johnson is betting his life (an 
eternal one) on these odds, 
would you like to? 

Mutation (t he supposed 
wayan organism evolves) are 
rare. Good ones (the ones 
needed ) are even rarer. 
Mutations also introduce a 
"genetic load" which is 
harmful to the species. 

Rocks with fossils are dated 
by index fos, ils. Index fossils 
give the date by what stage of 
evolution they are in . The 
geologic column is thereby 
constructed (the ent ire column 
is never found in nature). This 
column is then used to prove 
evolution. But noti ce: 

How to follow Fellini. 

evolut ion is assumed, t hen the 
column made, and the column 
"proves" evolu tion. Circular 
reasoning! 

The three assumptions of 
Radiometric Dating (for rocks 
without fossi ls) are: I) a closed 
system, 2) initial makeup 
known. and 3) constant decay. 
All of these are false. (3 is the 
best , but even decay rates can 
vary). 

The mi ssi ng link s of 
evolution are still mi s ing. 
Thousa nds are postulated, but 
none found. Archaeopteryx is 
now considered a true bird as 
Neanderthal man is counted a 
true man (further refutation is 
too grea t for treatment here). 

The fossil record is the great 
proof of past evolution . Now 
two evolutionists. Gould and 
Eldredge have challenged the 
current view of the fos sil 
record . They put forth a new 
idea for evolution (though they 
do not put forth why or how 
life evolved) but the new view 
of t he fo ssi l record is 
consistent with the creation 
mode\.

AS meets: 
elections 
approach 
Several items approved 

By KAREN MULLEN 
Stall Writer 

The last A UCSD meeting, 
Feb. 16, was very productive 
as several it ems on the agenda 
were approved. by consensus, 
only a few were tabled. and one 
failed 

Election codes approved 
after minor changes 

After much discussion, the 
A~ Council approved, by 
consensus. the Election Codes. 
The only change made was the 
addItion of a definition of a 
"slate," which will allow a 
group of people to run together 
and to campaign under the 
same slogan. This will entail a 
$600 campaIgn expenditure 
celitng for candidates running 
on a slat e and the option oi 
having a candidate's slate 
name next to his her own 
name on the ballot. Filing 
begm - Feb. 28. 

Beware - a dry TG 
Undergraduate Affairs and 

the ASUCSD are sponsoring 
an Alcohol Awareness Week 
for the second week of spring 
quarter. Randy Woodard. the 
AS and tudent Organizations 
advisor, was allocated. by 
consensus, $1000 from the 
Council's programming fund 
for a "dry TG" which is 
expected to be the highlight of 
t he event. U ndergrad ua te 
Affairs had already contrib-
uted $2,280. 

Jimmy Buffet. the Bus Boys 
and Jack Mack and the Heart 
Attack are just a few of the 
bands that Woodard is looking 
into for the TG entertainment. 
Woodard is al-;o trying to get a

UCSD's COOPS benefit campus 
on·campus pick-up system 
was implemented. 

Currently, the eight 
members of the Recycling Co· 
op are maintaining recycling 
bin for paper throughout the 
campu , and they are in the 
process of placi ng brightly-
colored aluminum can 
recycling bins around as wel l. 
They are also working on 
enlarging the glass bottle 
recycling system. 

be done." 
Another co·op involved with 

the environment is Torrey 
Farms . Although it just 
became a registered co-op this 
school year,its origins date 
back to a community garden 
project that began in the late 
1960's. 

op. 
One uch project is a fruit 

orchard with subtropical trees 
which is planned for the area 
behind the Che Cafe. If fully 
completed, the area will have 
benches, po ted eco logical 
information, and ripe fruit for 
public consumpt ion. 

Although their serv ices are 
different and their ph iloso· 
phies vary, all the co·ops 
provide places for s tudent 
involvement and are cons ider· 
ed by many to be valuable 
educational entities at UCSD. 

Tuesday, February 22, 1983 

Reg Fee raises salaries 
continued from page 5 
traveling expense fund, and it 
too, was passed by the Reg Fee 
with relative ease. 

Only committee member 
Sally Rice expressed opposi-
tion by saying, "As a grad 
student who ha ' to scrounge 
for every cent, I don't know if 
it 's fair to have to pay for . 
someone else's activit ies. I 
wish someone would pay for 
my fieldwork. " 

In related events, the 
committee made an official 
recommendation, reading in 
part, "The Reg Fee cannot, in 

the future, be the sole 
supporter of intercollegiate 
athletics." The committee will 
recommend that the admini . 
tration consider a fund·raising 
coordinator, thereby creating 
anoth er potential income 
source. 

All committee decisions are 
tentative and will not be 
fi nalized until the final budget 
meeting, which will be held 
the last week of April. 

Chair Gerrie Hatton gives a 
rather bright assessment of 
the chances for official passage 
of the coaches' salaries and 
travelling expense decisions: 

Unlike the other co·ops, the 
Recycling Co·op has had few 
financial difficulties. The 
Recycling Co·op ha "virtua lly 
no overhead," and it "can 
generate money easily," aid 
Skip Rochefort, the Recycling 
Co·op's bookkeeper. 

One problem the Recycling 
Co·op doe face, though. is a 
lack of mem bers. As one 
member stated. "It is not that 
glamorous of a thing. therefore 
it is harder to recruit 
members." . 

Torrey Farms is located on 
land north of the old Third 
Apartments. The actual 
garden site is just a bit south of 
the corner of Genesse Avenue 
and North Torrey Pines Road . 
Twelve members workat least 
three hours a week, many 
times during weekend work 
parties, to cultivate the plants. 
Two·thirds of the garden is 
general co·op beds and the rest 
are individual plots. Members 
harvest the general co-op beds 
and, at times, they sell the 
excess produce 10 theCheCafe 
or the Food Co·op. 

AS tneets: productive 
"They will more than likely 
pass, and in fact , with the 
tentative vote going the way it 
did, I can't see them not 
passing." 

Most of the Recycling Co-op 
members claim to be 
committed to better manage-
ment of our natural re ources. 
They hope to "increase 
people's awareness of the 
conSequence of their actions 
and change behavior to the 
benefit of society," stated 
member Jeff Groger. He added 
that Recycling Co-oP members 
want cans, bottles, and paper 
to be "consciously recycled." 

Recycling Co-op members' 
philosphy is to promote 
positive change. Recycling 
Co·op member Terry Arges 
commented , "There is reason 
to be opt imistic that a lot can 

Torrey Farms, like the other 
co·ops, ha an underlying goal 
aside from simply growing 
plants. "Ecological farming 
methods - especially organic 
methods are taught to people," 
stated Torrey Farms member 
Edward Smith. By organic, 
this means they use only 
selective biological methods 
for fertilizing and pest control. 
for example, members take 
compost from the Che Cafe 
and use it to fertilize the soil. 

The problem that now 
plagues Torrey Farms is a 
small membership due to a 
lack of publicity. A number of 
projects are in the works, 
though, which members 
believe will generate more 
interest in Torrey Farms Co· 

(a lias the Crew Team) with 
the $3,500 underwrite 
provided by the AS. The boat 
has a "12 to 20 year life 
expectancy," and i expected 
to make the Crew Team more 
competitive. 

Yes, no, maybe so 
The $326.50 operating 

budget that the Pre·Med 
Student Association (PMSA) 
requested was tabled to the 
Finance Committee. The 
PMSA did not go away empty· 
handed, however, because the 
Council approved a $465 
underwrite for a movie 
fundrai er.

All areas of UCSD sports 
fared well in the committee 
room Friday, as a proposal 
submitted by Recreation 
Director Bert Kobayashi 
passed in all three unrelated 
segments. The committee 
approved a request for $4,500 
to pay for intramural referees 
next year. $3,600 will be 
provided to the Mission Bay 
Aquatic Center, and $30,000 
was approved for weight room

Prior to the intercollegiate

an oPpol1unity to watch the 
Senate in session. 

The Senate convened at 
about] :30, but onl y remained 
in session for abou t 15 minu tes 
before announcing a recess 
until 4:30. At that time, they 
would adjourn until Tuesday, 
apparently because no 
business wa able to proceed 
until the budget crisis was 
resolved in committee. 

However, there was a brief 
opportunity at the close of the 
session to speak with Senator 
Jim Ellis (R). 

Ellis is the state senator 
from the 39th district (San 
Diego), and is also the chair of 
the Senate's Committee on 
Constitutional Amendments. 

Ellis responded to the claim 
that more and more lo\\,-
income students would have to 
drop ou t i f fees kept i ncreas i ng 
by chuckling and stating that, 
"You show me a student who 
is academically qualified for 
the l1C and isn't able to get a 
scholarship or grant, and I'll 
show you a la7Y person." 

That evening, while dining 
on barbequed chicken and 
corn·on-the·cob. sl udents were 
addressed by the Chair of the 
As embly's Ways and Means 
Committee, John Vascon-
cellos. 

Vasconcellos, a Democrat 
and veteran of more than 
sixteen years in the Assembly. 
and a self'proclaimed follower 
of the renowned humanistic 
psychologist Carl Rogers, 
entertained students in what 
one student from UCLA 
deSCribed a~ "the most

weekend.' , 

Vasconcellos explalOed that. 
"Which way our society

morals, forget values, forget

ed ucation enables you to 
become fully developed , moral , 
car ing , se nsitive, bright , 
confident human beings." 

He also explained his history 
in the A sembly, and the 
difficulties that he had to 
endure through the ixties and 
seventies. He eluded to the 
st ruggl es that had been 
fought, such as, "The draft, 
rac ism, sexism, minority 
studies programs, and making 
the universities less auto· 
cratic." 

He further stated that, "I 
went through some very 
difficult times on campuses 
and here in the capital as well . 
.. I was known as the touchy· 
feely legislator thought to be 
kind of goofy." 

He cont inued by describing 
a problem with the governor's 
priorities, stating that, "The 
new governor, in his second 
act, took away $20 mIllion 
from UC. and $20 million from 
CSUC without asking anyone. 
You know, he just didn't 
bother to ask. And he wants to 
take away $10 mtllion from 
child abuse programs and 
welfare from pregnant 
women. I mean, you've got to 
be some kind of 18th century 
visionary, if that's the right 
word, to take away money 
from kids not yet born and kids 
being abused and student 
who are all together maybe the 
hope for ~ociety, withou t ever 
asking anybody what it 
means. And I guess Caroline 
(Associate Director of the 
Student Lobby) \\as asking me 
alx)Ut \\ hat question tu ask the 
governor tomorrow of these 
few he will 'dam' to set'. which 
strIkes me as bIzarre, and I 
said ask him If he understands 
the world has changed." 

Tuesday began by having 
breakfast with more than 30 
State Senators and As-
semblymembers. Students 
discussed budget and fee 
concerns in bet ween bites of 
scrambled eggs and biscuits 
with gravy. 

UCSD st udents sat with 
Lucy Killea (J)), Assembly· 
member for the 78th District 
(San Diego), and Byron Sher 
(D), for the 21 st Dlsl rict 
(Carlsbad). 

Before lunch, UCSD 
students met \\ ith both Lucy 
Killea and Bill Craven rRi. 
Senator for the 38th Dlstnct 
(UCSD)' 

At the Killea meeting. 
students lobbIed the As ·

counter the governor's 
intention to raise fees. The\

Senator Jim Ellis (R.San Diego) hard at work. 

Fear and loathing 
continued from page 11 
People wandered back and 
forth. Everyone was busy 
talking, lobbying or being 
briefed about one bill or 
another. It seemed as though 
no one was ever pa ying 
attention to the legislator that 
had the floor. However, even if 
you were paying attention , it 
wa difficult to understand 
what was occuring. It seems 
that the 'enate uses ome 
strange secret code o r 
" mumbl e·jumble" that 
apparantly only they can 
understand. 

At the days end we felt 
pretty acclamated. We had 
met many of the state 
legislators. 'we knew our way 
around the capitol falrl) \\ell. 
and we became bet ter 
aquainted with our colleagues 
from the other mne "C 
campuse". 

It was also clear that not all 
the legislators were as uptight 
as we had fIrst believed There 
\\ere definate dIfferences 
bet\\een the dIfferent 
pohticians. It wasn't a case of 
\\ hether thev v,'ere Democrat 
or Republican or in theSenate 
or Assemblv 1t was more a 
case of the personality and 
attitudes each displayed. 

This vast difference of 
personalities IS easily seen 
comparing Assemblymember 
Tom Hayden (Los Angeles) to 
Senator Jim Ellis (San Diego). 
Alth oug h their different 
political ideals and beliefs are 
definitely a factor it was al so 

interesting to view how they 
dressed and talked. 

When we met with Senator 
Ellis , it was in his office. He 
stood and greeted us with a 
wide chesire grin. He was 
dressed in a dark blue suit, 
olid colored dress shirt. dark 

blue tie with gold diagonal 
stripes, which was fastened 
tightly round his neck, and his 
hair was cropped above his 
ears and swept up and over his 
forehead . 

He was polite and formal yet 
tense. We too were tense and 
unsure of where to begin. We 
both shook hands \\,.ith the 
senator and t hen sat in thet \\'0 
big. black. over ·tuffed. leather 
chairs (facing hIS desk) as he 
gestured to them with his 
hand. He then sat back in his 
chair and began to dISCUSS 
\.arious issues and concerns 
\\e had regarding student fees 
and the state budg('t 
problerms. 

We left. after being able to 
meet for onlv a few minutes. 
feehng quite ·dismayed. He did 
not seem \'ery open nor 
recepth·e. i)ut the one thing 
that really registered was 
when the senator had told us 
of hIS havtng a daughter \\ho 
attends l'CSD and vet he 
couldn't remember -whIch 
college she goes to. ThIS was 
very insightf ul as we left those 
aus tere surroundings. 

The atmosphere was 
undi sp utabl y dIffe rent in 
meeting with Tom Hayden.

Premedism options? 
Premeds have a bad 

reputation at UCSD (and at 
most other universities) . 
People describe them as overly 
competitive. narrow·minded, 
and insens itive to everything 
but grade. These are future 
physicians? No wonder health 
care has so many problems. 

Interesti ngly enough, many 
students who are them elves 
aiming for medical school deny 
that t hey have the abo\'e 
sympt oms of the dreaded 
"premedical syndrome." but 
the s tereot ype persists. And 
many factors contribute to its 
continuing existence. In the 
las t few years. there have been 
numerous attempts to a nal yze 
these factors and to remedy 
the problems in premedical 
education. For instance, in 
1980 the R oc kerfeller 
Foundat ion sponsored a 
special conference. Thi s led to 
the dis se mination of a 
pamphlet which attempts to 
dis pel some of the myths about 
predicial education. for 
exa mple: "premeds mu st be 
biology majors" (the reality: 
t hough fewer non ·sc len c(' 
majors apply to medical 
sc h oo ls. their rate of 
acceptance is lhe same as or 
greater than that of scicnce 
majors. once ha \ ' 1 ng met

three-year study which has 
been undertaken by the 
As soc iation of American 
Medical Colleges (w hich 
oversees medical education 
and publishes Medical ScJlOO/ 
Admissions Requirements) 
This study of the "Genera' 
Profcssional Education of the 
Phvsician and College 
Prearation for Medicine" is 
addressing a range of issue~ in 
an attempt to determine th 

"es~entla l knowledge. the 
fundamenta l ski lls and the 
personal qualities, val ues and 
attItudes" that are necessa ry 
for medicine. At a recen-t 
hf'anng to gather information 
for this study. there were 
manv references to (a nd jokes 
abou-t) the premed stereotype. 

But \\ ho is responsible for th 
stereotype? If medical schools 
demand high numbers (high 
GPA and MCAT scores) above 
all else,then students who 
want to become doctors will 
strive to achieve those high 
numbers. Medical school have 
reinforced the very Sy ndrome 
that they now deplore. lio\\ to 
hreak the vicious CIrcle? 

[f medical schools are in fact 
interested in more broadl\'· 
educa ted applicants. then thIS 
fact nee<is to he COlllm unicated 
to :-.t udents. AcademIC and 
career ad\ hors need to

people go to doctors wit h whal 
are called "common comp

medicine ent ai ls far more than

At LJCSD. the Common· 
wealth · Hea lth Profess ion s 
Program (HP) has for four 

year encouraged students to 
gain both broad academic and 
broad experiential preparation 
for medi c ine and health 
careers. As part of an eight· 
univer s ity nationwide 
program , the liP has provided 
a small group of students with 
s pecially·designed courses in 
the natural sciences, social 
~cie n ces, humanities and 
interdi sc iplinary areas . 
Program staff helps students 
to develop field placements -
most for academic credit - to 
find out what medicine is Itke 
before committ ing themselves 
to the lengthy (and expensive) 
application and training 
processes. A seri('s of seminars 
with guest s peakers and a 
weekly newsletter also help 
students to lea rn about their

will be medicine or another

When the University of 
Southern California rugby . 
team went running past me 
during their pre-game warm-
up last Saturday, I sized them 
up: they're big, they're strong-
looking, and - what's most 
frightening - they're got 
these accents t hat place a lot of 
their origins in lands where 
rugby is a major sport -
places where they would have 
grown up playing rugby. If 
they did grow up playing 
rugby, they must not have 
done it too well, because the 
Tritons muddied them, 24-16. 

From the very beginning of 
the match it looked as though 
the UCSD Tritons could win 
just with their strong will and 
determination ; it soon became 
evident that skill, talent, and 
strength were among their 
assets too. The Tritons, who 
are now 2-0 in league play for 
the season, are not a team to be 
taken lightly. 

The first try (rugby's 
equivalent to a touchdown) 
was cored by Lenny Mygatt 
when he jumped on the ball 
after he had "grubber kicked" 
it over the goal line. Grubber-
kicking resembles soccer play 
in that it is a serie of kicks 
toward a goal. 

In rugby, there i no way to 
move the ball forward a ide 
from running with it or 
kicking it. There is no forward 
passing; all passes are thrown 
lightly backward, usually 

down a line that is et up for it. 
When one player is being 
blocked and can run no 
further, he pa e to a player 
beside and lightly behind 
him , who will do the same 
when he is trapped. 

Shortly after the Tritons 
answered that first four-point 

The UCSD Guardian 

Tritons upset Trojan ruggers 
try with a kick for post wort h 
three, MygaU came back to 
touch for his second try of the 
game after running at least 
half the length of the field 
staying far out of reach of the 
nearest USC rugger. The core 
then rested awhile at 8-3, with 
UCSD holding the lead . 

There was no shortage of 
infracti.ons in this game, as 
was eVIdent from the number 
of cums and line -outs. 
Serums are formed by the

Staff Writer 

interlocking of the players' 
arms with shoulder and 
waists, with the two teams 
facing each other in these pile-
ups. The ball is then thrown in 
under this mass of bodies, and 
the players compete to get the 
ball to their serum-half by 
scratching at the ground with 
their feet. Line-outs, like 
serums, are used to determine 
posess ion after the ball has 
gone out of bounds or after an 
infraction. In this play, 

members of the two teams 
stand side-by-side in a long line 
which extends from the 
ideline_ A member of the 

designated team then stands 
on the sideline, calls the play, 
and throws the ball in over the 
line of players who are trying 
to bat it to a teammate. 

It was on a serum that the 
Trojans scored their fir st try. 
After nearly scoring on a run 
and being topped , a scrum 
was called for by the referee. 

up and down week's play leaves 
men's spikers with a 4-11 record 
By ROBIN DEARBORN 

Slaff Wriler 

The men's volleyball team 
began the week' play last 
Tuesday by beating La Verne, 
at La Verne, 15-3, 15·6, and 16-
14. The Tritons ended their 
play on a down beat, losing to 
Long Beach State Saturday 
night 7-15, 8-15, and 7- 15. 
Overall the week was 
succe sful, according to Coach 
Doug Dannevik, who felt 
"encouraged by the club's 
playing hard especially 
against Long Beach, a team 
ranked in the top eIght 
nationall y." 

The La Verne match, won 
handily, did not pre ent 
anything particularly eXCIt ing 
in itself, except it represented 
the Triton's fourth win , 
boosting their record to 4-10. 

One interesting note is that in ' 
the third game Dannevik 
played all of his six fre hmen , 
mo t of whom have seen little 
or no action so far this season. 
This group showed great 
promise for the future by 
coming back from a 9-14 deficit 
to end the match with a 16-J4 
victory. 

Saturday's action in the 
Main Gym was steady, and not 
at all di scouraging. Long 
Beach dominated throughout 
all three games, but the 
Tritons were never completely 
out of the action. Dannev ik 
summed up the evening when 
he said , "They scored points, 
and we scored side-outs." This 
was particularly true at the 
net; Long Beach blocked most 
of the Tri tons' hits for points, 
while UCSD's blockers had 

diffi cu lty blocking Long 
Beach's quick offen se. 

Dann evi k compl emented 
Chip Yos hino on his setting 
and Larry McDonough on his 
set play, adding, "There IS no 
pride lost by losing to a 
superior team." 

The Tntons will take on 
tough Loyola Marymount in 
t heir next match, Tuesday 
night, Loyola 4 pm. In a 
rematch of th e Tritons' five-
game victory J 1 days ago in the 
gym, Loyola will ha ve several 
incentives to wi n: a taste for 
revenge, the home court 
advantage, and familiarity 
with CSD's game plan, a ll of 
which should contribute to 
another great match. The 
Tritons w ill be Iback home 
Saturday at 4 pm against UC 
Ri\·erslde. 

Tuesday, February 22, 1983 

Right on the goalline, USC 
managed to get the ball to its 
se rum -half and score , selling 
the score at 8-9. USC was 
leading for the first a'1d only 
time in the game. 

Tempers were getting short 
as both teams seemed to 
disagree at one timeor another 
with the refer ee's call . 
Players often had to coax 
fellow teammates out of 
voicing their opinions to the 
ref. The game was gelling 
rougher, and the cheers were 
almost as loud as when a 
Triton made a pouncing tackle 
on a Trojan as they had been 
when the two previou trie. 
had been scored . 

UCSD recovered the lead in 
the second half when Pat 
Belding ran in to touch for a 
try, making the score 12-9. 
Tom Souza was the next 
Triton to score, his try raising 
the lead to 16-9. 

USC was able to core three 
point on a kick for post before 
Tim Sweeny of the Tritons 
touched for two trie. in a row , 
yielding a total of eight POll1ts 
to his credit. When Sween\ 
was f1Oished. the score was2..j· 
12. 

The last try of the game was 
scored by USC in a last effort 
to even things up a littl e bit, 
and the game ended with a 
score of 24-16. THe UCSD 
ruggers left the field with 
smiling faces and a thirst of 
the traditional rugby part 
which would follow . 

The Tritons ' next match 
will be held on Saturdav, Feb. 
26 against Ca l Poly Pomona, In 
Pomona. The following 
Saturda y. March 5 they will 
host UC [rvine on Muir Field 
at 1 pm.

Running Thoughts 
By MIKE GRE.ENBERG and JEFF SAVAGE 

SlaH Writ"r .. 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE DEPT. Athletic Director judy 
Sweet appeared to have done her homework when she hired 
men's tenni s coach Don Kramer last November. Kramer, who 
skippered the Triton men to an early 4-0 record thi s season, was 
formerl y employed for four years at Torrey Pines High SchooL In 
those yea rs , Kramer produced two league championships and 
two CIF semi -final finishes. Why would a successful high school 
coach depart for a low paying job at UCSD? Says Kramer. "My 
career is in tenni s. This is a great opportunity for me to move up 
to the collegiate le\ eL" Although the team has been successful , 
Kramer has already experienced th e difficulties of UCSD's low 
emphasis on intercollegiate athletics, "It is obvious that there is 
a low priority on athleti cs here," said Kramer. "For exam pIe, we 
have to practice under the lights because PE classes u e th e 
facilities during the day. It 's frustrating because I ha ve not had a 
chance to practice w ith the whole team together yet." Despite 
these adverse condit IO ns, it appears Kramer has UCSD on its 
way to a productive year. Some of the credit for that goes lOjudy 
Sweet. 
NOT TO BE BELIEVED DEPT, Renee Richards. The former 
tennis pro and current coach of Mart 111 a Navratilova boa 'its that 
she is th e fi rst female alumnus of Yale. She graduated 1-1 years 
before the school official Iv went coed in 1969. The school denies 
the cla im , say ing the transsexual l~i chards was still called 
Richard Raskind in 1955. 
WAIT A MINUTE DEPT. Next month mark the 90th 
anniversary of the first ba 'ketball game ever played by women. 
The event took place at Smith College in Massachusetts and was 
closed to men because the ladies !->howed up scantil y clad in 
bloomers and long sleeved, high button blouses. The score was a 
whopping 5-4, but a good time was had by all a nd the game 
became an annual campus affair. That mu t have been asight to 
see. 
THEY ASKED FOR IT DEPT. Last Wednesday at the Andy 
Williams pro-am, we were startled by an athlete who stayed for 
what seemed like hours handing out autographs to adoring fans. 
While most celebrities walked ai mless ly by, thi man was not 
only patient but cordial when asked the same questions over and 
over. The man 's name was Steve Garvey. He is one of the few 
athletes who acts as cordially in per on as hi s public image 
would uggest. 
QUOTES EXTRAORDINAIRE jerry anders, a referee 
for 11 yea rs, talking about what an offic ial's job entails from the 
first year on. "Refereeing i the only profession where one has to 
start out perfect, and then is supposed to get better and better 
with experience.

at 39-24 . 

UCSD went through the 
motions in the second half. 
With the money already in the 
bank, Malone took advantage 
of the o pportunit y by 
continuall y cha nging the 
lineup. thereby keeping the 
troops fresh against the weary

Everyone scored . 

Parker led the Tritons in the 
scoring column with 17 poin ts. 
Krause and Teik Francis 

added 12 apiece. 
The Triton close out their 

most successful season in 
history this weekend at home. 
Point Loma College will invade 
the Pav ilion Friday at 5: 15 and 
and the University of an 
Diego will be here Saturday 
evening at 7:30. If the Tritons 
can come out of these last two 
contests with two Ws, Cal 
Baptis t. by virtue of its victory 
over UCSD up north, is the 
on ly team standing between 
the Tritons and their playoff 
dream.

Loathing 
continu d from page 12 
Hayden. wearing well-worn 
brown leather shoes, brown 
slacks, a purple shirt with 
narrow red and yellow vertical 
striping, and a dark blue tie 
striped diagonally in gold and 
orange which hung loosely 
around his open collar. also 
outstretched his hand and 
greeted us as we sat down. 

Hayden casually sat on the 
edge of his desk and seemed 
very much at ease with us. 
The atmosphere was loose and 
informal. He discussed the 
need for students to see this 
battle. o'er educatIOn fees and 
the budget. as "a long-term 
truggle ." We discu - ed 

various ideals and realities. 
and were very encouraged as 
he ended by tating. "I would 
be glad to come to your 
campu es if this would help 
stir up interest." We departed 
feeling very uplifted and 
confident that role models for 
change still exi ted within the 
bureaucracy_ 

The legislator weren't the 
only group that differed in 
attitudes and personalities. 
Our comrades. our colleagues, 
our compatriots also suffered 
from divergent phdosophies in 
dress and mannerisms. 

There exi ·ted among the 
student group a particular 
clan of well-dressed. preppy. 
upstanding college students. 
This was the delegation from 
UCLA. The men were dressed 
in three-piece suits and lies. 
with haIr combed neatly. and 
very clean shaven faces. The 
women wore long formal 

dresses, and theIr haIr was 
brushed in proper fashion . 
The UCLA students seemed to 
hang out together. eat 
together. walk together, and as 
we had seen, even slept 
together. 

There were also students 
there that appeared a bit more 
upbeat. uptempo, and up-to-
everything. These were the 
student · from UC Santa Cruz 
and Berkeley. The men wore 
Levis and T-shirts, had 
slightly longer hair. and a five 
O-c1ock shadow on some. The 
women were donned in Levis. 
tie-dyed . kirtc;, brightly 
colored leotards. and loose knit 
shirts . 

The st udents from UCSD 
fell somewhere in bet ween 
these two groups. Half of our 
delegates fit in more WIth the 
Santa Cruz ..;tudents and half 
with UCLA. The ones who 
wore 'Walkmans', the entire 
time, fit in with the latter 
grouo. 

However. everybody seemed 
to relax, open-up, and co-
mingle at the Student Lobby's 
12th annual annIversary 
party, held at the Lobby's 
offices before dinner. The 
relaxing cant inued into dinner 
as well. 

The workshops. speeches. 
and politicking had ended and 
we ate and drank and drank 
and drank at the Country 
Maid Inn, at 1030 J street 
where the entire place had 
been reserved for the lobby. 

Suprismgly we arrived on 
time. It' , hard to explain. but 
we think our arrivial was 
directly pn,n~ortional to how 
hungr y ,'we were. We 
discovered that the lobbv had 
arranged coupons for -each 
st udent to exchange for two 

The UCSD Guardian 

beers or wine. Seeing what 
t hey were going to serve we· 
decided to go on an immediate 
liquid diet. Somehow we all 
secured more coupons. 
Needless to say, it was a 
memorable night. what we 
remember of it. At this point 
we had been up for over 36 
hours, hadn't eaten much, but 
were feeling pretty good. 

Jim Yl,Idelson , a 33 year old 
freelance photographer from 
San Francisco, kept all of us 
laughing with numerous 
slories of his photographic 
experiences. We all became a 
photographic memory after 
dinner as we collected all the 
empty beer bottles. stacked 
them together. and stood as 
still as possible, crouched 
down below the bottles as we 
posed for several shots. 

After dinner everyone 
rocked out to the Rocking 
Horse band. Thi;,; marked a 
first for all of us as no one 
could ever recall dancing to a 
country-punk band that 
played rock music. 

The highlight of the night 
came when Caroline Tesch, 
UC Student Lobby Associate 
Director. picked up the 
microphone and began 
singmg! It was outrageously 
bold and as far as we can 
remember was better than Pat 
Benatar and Dianna Ross 
combined! 

We all retired to the 
"comfortable mats" on the 
YMCA floor that evening and 
had quite a re tful s leep. 

Tuesday was the actual day 
of hardball lobbying and 
basically went a follows: 
breakfast. awards, lobbying, 
eating, lobbying, eating, 
lobbying, excitment, lobby-
ing. depression and more

This was followed by lunch, 

more awards, lobbying, 
handshaking, lobbying, and a 
defiantly uplifting attempt at a 
protest in Duke's office--Right 
On l 

Before making the dri\'e 
back to San Diego, one final 
stop was necessary at a local 
deli. It was here that we 
purchased submarine .sand-
wiches, meatball sandWIches, 
macaroni salad, sodas, chips, 
and of course plenty of 
vegetanan pasta--as It was on 
sale for only 59¢ a pint. 

We all were, as Hunter 
Thompson exclaimed at the 
end of his saga. " ... just sick 
enough to be totally 
con fiden!."

places to gather sustenance 
was the press room. where a 
disgusting stew was given to 
those who needed it. Securit, 
was very light in there, two 
armed guards guarding the 
bar along with several 
menacing old PGA pre"s 
whores in checkered polye~ter 
s lacks glaring at anyone 
making hi ' way near the 
edibles. I suspect they had 
orders to shoot to kill.

Our interdisciplinary course on . ~~ I 0;. human sexuality was offered 
for the first tIme In 1 978. We are . ,_ ' pleased to be able to schedule It 
again this spring, and welcome interested students. 

The goal of the course is to emphasize the place of sexuality in the 
achievement of personal identity, a social role, and a satisfying relationship with 
others. Therefore, instead of a course with the exclusive emphasis on anatomy of 
sexual function and dysfunction (though these are included) we are offering onr 
sexual function and dysfunction (though these are included) we are offering one 
that considers human sexuality in terms of anthropology, history, literature, 
economiCS, the law, political science, ethno-botany, psychology, and psychiatry.
