Challengers .react as 
abortion issue continues 

by Alan Russell 
Editor 

The three individuals, the three personalities, are quite 
different. But what Susan Erzinger, Peggy Patton and Albin 
Rhomberg, the students who have taken up a court challenge of 
UCSD's mandatory health insurance fees which provide for 
abortion, have in common is a collective sense of purpose, a 
shared confidence and determination that they are going to 
eradicate something which they see as very wrong. Their path 
to vindication, however, has not been an easy one, as was 
learned in a recent interview with the three. 

"It has been a big hassle," said Albin Rhomber, Applied 
Physics and Infonnati.onal Science (APIS) graduate student. 
"Because the case, was taking up so much of my time I got very 
little work done this quarter and found it necessary to ask for a 
leave of absence." 

This is ,he second in a four part series dealing with the 
abortion controversy on campus. 

In addition to delaying his career goals, Rhomberg detailed 
other difficulties brought on by the situation, including his 
having to "fight" for the university apartment he currently 
lives in because of his not being an officially registered student 
(see Triton Times Jan. 9). As for the holidays, Rhomberg felt 
there were "too many things up in the air" (in regards to the 
case) to allow him a vacation with his family in Iowa. 

Susan Erzinger, who was to be an entering UCSD freshman 
last fall, faces di((erent kinds of problems. Because of the 
uncertain situation of credit for academic work, she opted not to 
attend classes but rather get a job. 

"It's been strange," said Erzinger. " My friends have come 
home from school during Thanksgiving and Christmas 
vacations and asked me, 'How's school? ' I'd hear how they 
were having such a good time at college, and naturally I wished 
I could be doing the same." 

1'1 realty mi 8 IIOt being in schoot." 
Transferred &0 USD 

Because of this, and the fact that she just doesn't know 
"what's aoing to happen," Erzinger applied and was accepted 
at the University of San Diego, and starts classes there Jan. 30. 

Peggy Patton, Muir sophomore, has' stayed with her studies, 
and said that she didn't spend "eight hour days studying for 
finals for that work to be in vain." 

Most of Patton's difficulties came from not being on the 
"official" class roles, forcing her on several occasions to 
explain her presence. Until matters are better settled in the 
courts, her grades remain on file with teaching assistants and 
professors. 

"We're going to win this case," said Patton, "and so I've done 
my work with that in mind." 

Support for the students has come froro a number of fronts, 
according to the three. Rhomberg said that a "great many" 
UCSD students expressed pleasure at the very idea of 
challenging the fee system. Outside of the university it was seen 
that various pro-life groups volunteered their help, but were 
asked by the three to act as individuals, not organizations, for 
their cause, writing letters and the like. An editorial of support 
in the San Diego Union also heartened the three.

Armitage draws good reaction 
Ohio State VP seen as scholar, good administrator 

by Mark Stadler 
Senior Editor 

The campus reaction to 
Chancellor McElroy's appoint-
ment of Richard Armitage, the 
Vice-president for Student 
Services at Ohio State U niversi-
ty, has been quite favorable. 

The reactions from adminis-
trators, faculty and students 
interviewed by the Triton 
Times ranged from a professor 
who knows Armitage who said, 
" I think it's great," to a student 
member of the vice-chancellor 
search committee who aid, 
"No other candidate was even 
in the same ballpark with 
Armitage. " 

Armitage will replace 
George Murphy, who resigned 
last A '1 as vice-chancellor 

KeviIIEckery 
after 10 years at that post. 
Physical education chairman 
Howard Hunt will hold the 
acting position until Armitage 
arrives at UCSD this June. 

Various Positions 
Except for one brief interval, 

Armitage has served at a 
variety of administrative 
positions at Ohio State since 
1954. Those positions included 
Dean of Graduate Students and 
University Ombudsman. In 
addition, he said in his resume 
that he has taught at "least one 
class each year at Ohio State, in 
his field of the romance 
languages. 

Two UCSD professors and 
one administrator who know 
Armitage painted a picture of 
him as both a good scholar and 
a good administrator, who 
works well with students and is 
well-versed in crisis situations, 
such as the period of student 
demonstrations in the sixties. 

English literature professor 
Andy Wright, who taught at 
Ohio State from 1949 to 1963 and 
knows Armitage from that 
period, said he thinks "it's 
great" that Armitage was 
elected. "I couldn't be more 
pleased," Wright said. 

Revelle College Dean Ernie 
Mort, who headed the Ohio 
State Religious Student Center 
from 1960 to 1966, said he has a 
"very, very positive 'reaction" 
to Armitage's selection , 
because Armitage is a "very 
respected person." 

English and American 
literature professor Roy 
Harvey Pearce, who taught at 
Ohio State from IM9 to 1963, 
called Armitage a "first-rate 
dean of graduate students," 
because he is a "good scholar, 
who understands what scholar-

ship is, and has very high 
standards. " 

"Well-run" program 
The graduate program 

Armitage headed, which was 
" very huge" was "well-run and 
well-operated," Pearce said. 

Wright said Armitage " has a 
God-given capacity to relate to 
other people , including 
students of all levels." During 
the turbulent student activism 
period of the sixties, Armitage 
"was one of tM few people who 
was able to go out on the 
battlefield and make his voice 
heard," Wright said. 

Mort also spoke of Armi-
tage's role as graduate student 
dean during the early sixties, 
saying that Armitage " pro-
vided a great deal of leadership 
during that period." 

During the Free Speech 
Movement of that period , 
Armitage generally supported 
the rights of students to speak 
out on the issues and organize 
themselves, Mort said. 

Pearce described Armitage 
as a person who listens closely 
and reflectively, and who is 
very reasonable . However , 
Pearce added that Armitage is 
"very strong-minded. Once he 
makes up his mind on a subject 
he doesn't change it." 

According to both Pearce and 
Wright, Armitage should be 
pleased with the low-key, low-
budget UCSD athletic pro-
gram. Pearce said Armitage 
was "one of the few people who 
had the guts to fight against the 
bad sides of Ohio State's big-
time athletic program." 

Leave Woody 
Wright said Armitage 

"shOltld be delighted to get 
away from Woody Hayes," the 
bellicose Ohio State football 

coach. 
Two student members of the 

vice-chancellor search com-
mittee, which spent almost six 
months reviewing candidates, 
before recommendin four 
final , 

Enaie Mort 
also voiced pleasure with 
Armitage's selection. 

AS President Jeff Leifer said 
Armitage was his first choice, 
because " he is warm, compet-
ent and experienced in a 
student affairs type situation. " 
Leifer said Armitage, in the 
past , has demonstrated an 
ability to both initiate new 
programs and to "sensitively 
renovate or axe programs that 
aren't working." 

Marsha Harris, the student 
co-chair of the Advisory 
Committee on Student Fee 
Programs aid, " 1 hav~ 
confidence in Armitage , 
because he came across well in 
interviews and because his 
resume was impressive."

New information "sheds 
light" on student loans 

(CPS) - If students have 
been in the dark about student 
loans, perhaps a new regulation 
from the Office of Education 
will shed some light on the 
situation. 

A new government rule will 
require colleges and post-
secondary vocational chools to 
give information about dropout 
rates and the full cost of 
attendance and loans . 

The regulation will affect 
8,300 institutions that partici-
pate in the federal student aid 
or loan programs including the 

see what percentag p. of 
students complete a particular 
course of study, but only if the 
school puts together that

including on and off-campu 
living.

Hant sbould won :very hard at repairing bls relationship with 
the student members 0' the Advisory Committee on Student Fee 
Proarams. The sludent members stili feel disillusioned over the 
conlroversy·thal retlulted from Hunt's allocation 0' money which 
tbe committee recommended should be saved for future uses. 
Even though the students ended their short boycott of .the 
committee. we believe they took that action more out of the belief 
that their walkout would not prodUce change than for any other 
reason. 

Misuse of funds 
A Triton Times investigation has revealed that AS 

Commissioner of Extemal Affairs Bob Drapeau on at least two 
occasions last quarter used student funds &0 rent expensive can, 
wbich he used as lr8Dsporlation while attending Board of Relents 
meetin,s. In addition. Drapeau missed a critical portion of ctne 
Re,ents meeting. according &0 UCSD students at the meeting. 

When asked about &hese charges by one of our staff members. 
Drapeau did not deny &heir validity . However. he did say that if 
&hey were printed be weuld sue us. 

The AS Council, at their last meeting of FaU Quarter. voted &0 
have its Finance Committee make a formal investigation of the 
cbarges. Since we used official AS business records for our 
investigation. we alsume the committee's investigation will 
reveal the same results as did ours. 

We feel &he best course for the AS Council Is to freeze Drapeau's 
budget to make sure similar funds misuses do not occur while the 
committee investigation is underway. Tbe $132 Drapeau spent 
renting tbe cars may seem &0 be a small portion of the $62.000 
annual AS operating budget, but it was a definite misuse of student 
funds all the same. Tbis becomes especially clear when 
considered with Ute fact tbat the AS, until it adopts its own 
guidelines. is operating under regental rules, which require the 
use of the least expensive transportation available. 

Tbe Firebird and Monte Carlo that Drapeau rented do not 
represent inexpensive transportation. . 

The AS Council cannot allow this case to pass without significant 
comment. especially at a time when it is asking Sludent groups &0 
tighten their financial belts. Anything less would have the effect of 
sanctioning the misuse of student funds. 

Paper economics

America's close new ally in Africa: 
Sudan's emergence as world breadbasket 

by Ro,er Mann 
Pacific News Service 

"We're surrounded by all.of 
Africa's most notorious nut 
cases and madmen," said a 
young Sudanese fores~er, 
explaining some of the political 
problems faced by Africa's 
largest country as it attempts 
to barness its enormous 
potential. 

He then listed Uganda ' s 
unpredictable Idi Amin; 
Ethiopia's trigger-happy 
Marxist dictator, Mengistu 
lIaile Mariam;- Zaire's megalo-
maniac Mobutu Sese Seku; 
Libya's fundamentalist Islam-
ic fanatic Col. Muamar 
Gadaffi; and Jean Bokassa, 
who crowned himself emperor 
of Central Africa in an absurdly 
incongruous pageant in 
December. 

Despite the misfortune of 
sharing borders with them all, 
the Sudan, just to the south of 
Egypt and fronting the Red 
Sea, has never before enjoyed 
such political stability and is 
now probably attracting more 
Arab and Western aid and 
investment than any country in 
tropical Africa. 

The key to Sudan's emer-
gence is that its million square 
miles, a territory as large a~ 
the United States east of the 
Mississippi, contains 70 percent 
of all unexploited agricultural 
land in the Middle East. The oil-
exporting Arab states have 
designated the Sudan -
already self-conscious of its 
role as the bridge between the 
Arab and African worlds - as 
their future breadbasket. 

Until six years ago, political 
instability prevented active 
exploitation of the vast Sudan's 
tremendous potential. The 
Black Africans in the neglectetl 
southern region, still one of the 
most primitive areas in the 
world, were fighting a guerilla 
war of secession against the 
Arab-dominated northern 
government. 

But President Gaafar Ni-
meri, came to power in a left-
wing military coup , trium-
phantly solved the problem by 
granting the south regional 
autonomy. Nimeri at first 
relied heavily on the Soviet 
Union , but since an abortive 
Communist coup in 1971, 
Nimeri 's radical socialism has 
mellowed and he has joined 
Egypt and Saudi Arabia in an 
anti-Soviet Red Sea triangle . 

Unsuccessful coups against 
him recurred in 1975 and 1976. 
But a few months ago Nimeri 
granted a general amnesty to 
all plotters, released over 700 
political offenders from prison 
and invited all dissidents and 
political refugees abroad to 
return home. The most import-

ant pardoned returnee is Sadig 
el Mahdi, sen&enced in absentia 
to death for masterminding the 
1976 coup. 

Though the Sudan severed 
relations with the United States 
for five years following the 1967 
Arab-Israeli war and allowed 
them to plummet again four 
years ago when Palestinian 
terrorists murdered the 
American ambassador and his 
deputy here in Khartoum, the 
State Department's emerging 
African policy now regards the 
Sudan as one of America 's 
closest partners on the 
continent. 

Last month Sudan became 
the first African country the 
Ca rter Administration ap-
proved to receive American jet 
fighters . 

American exports to the 
Sudan during the past two 
years have exceeded $100 
million and an ambitious new 
aid program is in the pipeline. 

Arab interest in the Sudan 
intensified during tbe oil 
boycott that followed the 1973 
Arab-Israeli War. At that point 
the U.S. was talking of using its 
"food weapon" to counter the 
Arab "oil weapon." Since then, · 
Arab investment in Sudanese 
agricultural projects has been 
so phenomenal that the only 
remaining stumbling block is 
not money but the preparation 
of well·conceived development 
plans. 

President Nimeri last month 

officially inaugurated a project 
that could serve as a classic 
model for combining Arab 
petro-dollars witb Western 
technology and African ·raw 
materials. 

The World Bank supplement-
ed Kuwaiti and Saudi Arabian 
financing for the giant Rahad 
Project that is settling 15,000 
poor farm families on 300,000 
irrigated acres to grow cotton, 
peanuts and fruits and vege-
tables. American Aid provided 
the earth-moving equipment, 
and a variety of Western 
engineering and agri-business 
companies supplied advanced 
technology for what is the most 
modern agricultural settle-
ment scheme in all of Africa. 

Other modem mechanized 
agricultural ventures are in 
progress, such as tbe $eOO 
million Kenena Sugar project, 
which includes the world's 
largest sugar plantation. 

If its potential is realized, 
Sudan by the 1990s will join such 
countries as the United States, 
Canada and Argentina among 
the world 's major food export-
ers. . 

With internal stability 
secured for the first time since 
independence in 1956, the Sudan 
is also playing an increasingly 
important role in Arab and 
African affairs - usually 
speaking with a moderate anti-
communist voice. 

President Nimeri has been

on all manner of problems. The 
Koalumn will appear on the

Wednesday will feature the 
retum of last year's popular 
humor column, " White Whales

written by Edi~or Alan Russell . 
The first " White Whales" of 
1978 appears today on page 8. 

Friday will be the day for 
Senior Editor Mark Stadler's 
social commentary column. 
Stadler will deal mainly with 
campus events, although he 
will occasionally stray off-
campus to comment on local, 
statewide and national events. 

Harris said Armitage will 
rind a chance at UCSD to 
become more personal, since 
UCSD has about 25 percent as 
many students as does Ohio 
State. Armitage is used to 
"personalizing a system that is 
very impersonal," Harris said. 

Despite all the difficulties inherent in the situation, the 
students say they have never had any serious thoughts of giving 
up the struggle. Rhomberg admitted that, "So far it doesn't 
seem like we've made any progress," but felt that when the 
case came tocourt there would be seen a "clear discrimination 
(on tbe university's part) on the basis of religion." The three 
students are all Roman Catholics. 

Dissatisfaction was voiced among the three as to the way the 
situation has been handled by tbe UCSD administration. The 
students are incredulous , if not suspicious , that the 
administration has been unable to come up with a figure on how 
many abortion were perfonned last year.

HAIR STYLISTS 

Kevin Eckery, a Muir College 
representative to the AS who 
was one of a selected group of 
students who met with Armi-
tage last quarter, said he thinks 
Armitage" is this side of 
fantastic . He's got the concem 
and commitment to helping 
students and the wberewithal 
and knowledge to be a good 
manager. I just wish he didn't 
have to wait until June to come 
here." 

" It seems to me someone has to know," said Patton. 
Rhomberg, perhaps more cynical of the situation, said, "!hey 
(the administration) know those facts they want to know. He 
also said, "Talk (with the administration) has been very 
cheap" making the court case all but inevitable. 

DesPite what they call the "bureaucratic razzle-dazzle" over 
the Ugures Pattoli said, "The numbers shouldn't be important. 
I still~ cnsairee with it, It's against our morals." 

And it is those same morals wbich drive on the self-termed 
"conscientious objectors." "We can't give uP." said Patton. 
"That wouldD't solve anythlnl. The .ituation wouldn't change 
and they'd continue what they're dom.."

News Of The World, Queen (Elektra) 
"Tbis ain't rock and roll, tbis is 

genocide ... " Well. it may not be ,enocide, 
but it isn't rock, either. Queen is one of the 
more bizarre bands iD mainstream pop 
music today, and NeM Of The World only 
serves to cement tbat status. 

I remember being extremely bummed 
when I watched the baDd leave the stage 
during the performance of "Bohemian 
Rhapsody." If I had stayed home and 
listened to " Bo Rap" on my stereo, I would 
have been more comfortable and could 
have done more drugs to maximize tbe 
effect of the music . Wby go to a concert to 
stare at an empty stage and listen to a 
tape? 

But Queen is also becoming more 
;naccessible on disc. Despite all the multi-
tracked vocals and other 'frills, their 
material remains simple and unimagina· 
tive. It) like putting a Ferrari body over a 
Pinto engine: nash on the outside to 
disguise the srut underneath. All pomp and 
no circumstance. 

" We Will Rock You " is the most 
neanderthal piece to hit the airwaves since 
" Cat Scratch Redundancy." Sounds lik~ 
they ripped off the simple melody from 
John Lennon's "Give Peace a Chance." 
" We Are The Champions" can be simply 
dismissed as self-indulgent ego rock. But 
then Queen further clutters tbeir image by 
sounding like a gang of punks on "Sheer 
Heart Attack." Wha t are they trying to do? 
But the song that best exemplifies this 
ultimately forgettable LP is "Get Down, 
Make Love." 

Get down make love 
Get down make love 
Get down make love 
Get down make love 
You take my body-
I give you heat Heroes, David Bowie (RCA) 

" I really, honestly and truly, don't know 
how much longer my albums will sell. I 

t~nk they' re going to get more diversified, 
more extreme and radical right along with 
my writing. And I really don't give a 
shit ... " 

You say you're hungry 
I give you meat 
I suck your mind 
You blow my head 
Make love-
Inside your bed -
Everybody get down make love 

Whatever happened to subtlety and 
discretion? Ask Freddie Mercu ry. IT. M.)

Right on, David. Right on. I don't know 

what your record company is going to say, 

Concert Scene 
Enthusiasts who crowded the 

performance of " Die Winterreise ' 
with John Large, baritone and 
Howard Wells, piano, last fall , 
won't want to miss the second 
vocal recital in a series of three, 
Saturday, January 14, atBin room 
B210, Mandeville Center. 

For this concert of 20th century 
French melodies, John Large 
chose songs by Debussy, Poulenc 
and Ravel. "Three Ballades of 
Francois Villon" by Debussy 
begins the program. The ballads, 
both serious and absurd. are part 
of Villon ' s major work "Le 

Testament. " The songs demon-
strate Debussy's amazing ability 
to fuse poetry with music. 

"The B(lld Songs" by Poulenc, 
also a master at translating 
poetry into mu$,ic, celebrate wine, 
women, and love . Musical 
accompaniment to the songs, 
demands virtuosic skill of the 
pianist, amply met by Howard 
Wells. 

" Histoires Naturelles, " and 
"Don Quichotte a Dulcinee" by 
Ravel conclude the evening of 
songs. "Nature Stories" are 
Ravel's first major vocal work. A

The title track is Bowie's most engaging 
work. with a Cine balance be""een Bowie's

standouts are · the instrumental " V-s

"Sleuth" is 
almost good 

by Jill Louise Bazeley 
Arts Writer 

I have always believed that it 
isunfairtosay ofa play that, "it 
was nothing like the production 
I saw on Broadway ten years 
ago ," or " the movie was 
better," but in the case of 
"Sleuth" by Anthony Sharrer 
now running through February 
5 at the Old Globe Theatre, I 
must succumb to the urge and 
say that the movie was better. 
It was better because in it 
Andrew Wyke and Milo Tindle 
are portrayed mu c h less 
sympathetically than they are 
in Sandy McCallum's Old Globe 
version. When the characters 
become soft, as they are in this 
production, the play loses its 
edge, and when a mystery loses 
it edge it turns into a cheap 
melodrama. Even the violence 
gets tripped up and slides into a 
slot somewhere between farce 
and black humor. 

By fault of poor decision

is a blessing. After all , beggars 
can't be choosers. 

ters are Just too Dice, their ' 
stage business too sloppy and 
the text too contrived to make 
this suspensful revenge drama 
really believable in the 
mystery sense. 

But "Sleuth" has its mo-
ments. In the case of Mack 
Owen's superb acting, it is one 
long moment, since he is 
onstage the entire time, while 
Tom McCorry is exceptionally 
good here and there. (I can't 
say where without giving away 
the plot) . The exquisite. tense

A 
MAN 
STANDS OUT 
IN ••• 

by 'AlaQ flullell 
Irving "Calcie" Feinbaum 

and Joseph "the slide rule" 
Johnson were electrocuted 
early this morning under 
California's new state death 
penalty law. 

Feinbaum and Johnson, 
freshmen at Revelle College at 
UCSD , were convicted for 
putting soap detergent in the 
·Revelle fountain. 

The two pleaded not guilty on 
the grounds of being Revelle 
students. Their lawyer insisted 
this was tantamount to 
insanity. 

Judge LeRoy Houston, who 
sentenced the two young men to 
the chair a month ago , 
commented this morning that 
he was not sorry to see " justice 
done." Ala. R .... O 

Houston , incensed over media coverage indicating his 
sentencing might have been a bit harsh, vehemently backed up his 
ruling. "The two were a menace to society," he said. "They were 
ready to graduate.. to worse things. We found the plans and the 
evidence in their dorm room indicating their intentions to tum the 
fountain into a giant gelatin bowl. 

• 'Seven hundred and thirty seven boxes of Jell-O ain't just beans, 
boy." 

The carried out sentence was generally applauded by the UCSD 
administration. 

" It was an action long overdue," said Vice-chancellor of 
Academic Affairs Paul Sattman. " Reprehensible student action 
should be met with little or no lenience. In fact, I think the chair 
wasn't even enough. They should have been hung by their thumbs 
from Bonner Hall and left hanging for several days. That's the 
only way we can discourage such actions." _ 

Campus Police Chief Hugh French also agreed with the judge's 
ruling, saying, " It sets a good precedent." 

• 'Our men have always had the policy of asking questions first 
and then shooting," said French. " Now it looks like the judicial 
system is coming to its senses." 

Not surprisingly, there were no student demonstrations over the 
electrocutions. Officials didn't know whether to attribute this to 
fear, apathy or midterms. 

The official student newspaper, the Triton Times, has not yet 
come out with an editorial on the situation. They are reportedly 
still mulling over the pros and cons of the case. 

Among those students questioned there seemed to be a general 
feeling of accord with the actions of the c,ourt. 

" Suds are duds," said one skateboarder/surfer. " Real 
bummers, you know, man. Like I'd lose my traction and not be 
able to hang ten if the suds blew out of the fountain and onto the 
asphalt. " 

Another student was more practical. "I understand that they 
were pre-meds . Well, so am I. That's two down." 

In a final not~ to the story, it was learned that Feinbaum and 
Johnson made a last request to Judge Houston that their cremated 
ashes be set to sail in Revelle fountain . Their request was turned 
down by the judge. 

" Naturally, I denied it," he said. " All those jokers wanted to do 
was to mess up the fountain . They didn't care whether they were 
alive or dead."
