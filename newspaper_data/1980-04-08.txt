KKK Candidate to 
Address SDSU Today 

BY KAntY HUFFER 
When Ku Klux Klan Grand 

Dragon Tom Metzger speaks 
today on the steps of San 
Diego State University's 
Aztec Center, campus police 
and several student organiza· 
tions, including the Black 
Student Council, will find out if 
their efforts to avoid violence 
are successful. 

Metzger, a Democratic 
contender for the 78th District 
assembly seat will speak 
between 1 :30 and 2:00 this 
afternoon along with 11 other 
local candidates in SDSU's 
"Candidates Forum," a two· 
day event sponsored by the 
Associated Students. 

Controversy has been 
growing on campus since 
students came back from 
spring vacation yesterday and 
heard that Metzger will speak 
during the event. 

But while campus police 
have received reports of 
threatened violence, and 
rumors of a disturbance like 
the one at a recent KKK 
appearance in Oceanside were 
circulating on campus 
yesterday, precautionary 
measures are being taken to 
insure Metzger's safety and to 
prevent violence.

Egypt's Prosperity Reminiscent 
Of Another Islamic Nation: 
Will Sadat Join the Shah? 

BY WllLIAM BEEMAN 
CAIRO - Casual visitor. to Egypt these 
day. cannot help but feel thai a new wind is 
blowing in that ancient land. Construction i. 
booming on all aides. The country is 10 
swamped with touriats and businessmen that 
hotel rooms are almost impossible to find on

Pacific News Service. 
IIIOrt notice. The people appear happier and 
more optimistic than two years ago. . 

And yel, there ia IIOI1IetNng not quite right 
about the national state of mind. Perhapl 
Iranian, are better able than Westerner. to 
interpret its underlying unea.iness. 

For the atmosphere in Egypt todal seems 
very much like the abnosphere in Teheran 
some six years ago, after the sudden oil price 
increase that tripled Iran's national income let 
loose a flood of foreign salesmen, overheated 
the economy and led eventually to the 
revolution which unseated the Shah. 

Now the Shah ia in Esrvpt, welcomed by 
President Anwar Sadat ali~ fleeing Panama 
one step ahead of lawyers suing 10 extradite 
him to Iran. Iranian officials are calling that 
welcome " the beginning of the exploaion thai 
will send Sadat inlo the dustbin of history." 
And they may well be right. 

Like Iran in 1974, poll.Camp David Egypl 
is suddenly awash in money. Many peo~are 
getting rich very quickly. But t', 
economy ia not based on l1I1ything as 10 ' and 
tangible aa oil resourcea. The chief sources of

situation - the collapse of the Saudi Arabian 
government, t~ resumption of the Israeli· 
Arab conflict, failure to reach agreement on 
Jewiah aettJement policy, a renewal of fighting 
in Lebanon - could adveraely affect lhose 
income aourcea . 

Like iran'. in 1974, the Egyptian economy 
ia allO beginning to overheat. Innation i. 
running at about 30 percent annually, but 
wages are nol keeping pace . A new univer. ity 
graduate cannot hope to make more than the 
equivalent of $150 per month in a 
government job. E,yptians are used to a 
simple diet of unleavened bread and bro" 
beana, 10 m~d inflation in food prices can be 
lolerated . But the rise in rents throughout 
Cairo and other Iar,e cities i. putting hou.ing 

beyond the reach of yount persons looking for 
their first homes. The best apartments in Cairo 
rent for well over $1000 per month, and even 
the poorest lodgings cost $70 to $100 per 
month. 

The provinces are a ~ttIe less expensive, bul 
wagea are a110 lower. Simple arithmetic 
demonstrates how difficult it i. for young 
people who have the highest economic 
expectations to feel that they are progreasing 
along with the economy. 

Egypl has no ter~orist ~et police like 

Egypt's leaders have

Egyptians look askance at what they view 
as an imperial lifestyle adopted by Sadat and 
hia wife, with their II·guest houaea and 
glamorous international image. Sadat seem. 
Ie" and Ie .. a man of the people and more a 
jet. setter increasintly corrupted by We.tern 
ideal. and morality. 

Mrs. Sadat is particularly dialiked by 
traditionaliats. Her growint influence and 
personal wealth is viewed as a genuine threat 
to the Egyptian social order and culture. "Did 

~ hear, Jehan Sadal has .old the 
Tutankhamen treasure to the Japanese," one 
.hopkeeper reported breathlenly. When 
asked how such a thing could pouibly take 
place, he an.wered, "That woman is capable 
of anything." 

The mo.t cynical politicians liken her to the 
Philippines' Imelda Marcos, and feel thai she 
has political ambitions which extend beyond 
her husband'. rule.

Iran Relations Cut, 
Embargo Made Total 

WASHINGTON - Presi· 
dent Carter broke diplomatic 
rela tions with Iran yesterday, 
giving Ira nia n diplomats 24 
hours to lea ve the United 
States. 

. Carter, in an announcement 
broadcast live from the White 
House press room, said his 
go vernment has shown 
"exceptional pa tience and 
restraint" in trying to resolve 
the stalemate. 

But he said the refusal of the 
Iranian government to assume 
control of the hostages from 
the militanu who have held 
them for more than five 
months '1ays full responsibili. 
ty" for the crisis on Iran's 
revolutionary leader Ayatol· 
lah Ruhollah Khomeini and 
Iran's governing Revolutio· 
nary Council. 

Earlier in the day, Khomeini 
personally blocked the Iranian 
government from taking 
control of the hostages . 

Looking grim, Carter ~sted 

some actions he 15 taking 
against Iran: 

- "The United States is 
breaking diplomatic relations 
with Iran," said Carter . He 
said " Irania n diplomatic and 
consular personnel have been 
d e clared p e rsona non 
grata and must leave the 
country by midnight 
tomorrow. " 

- All visas issued to 
Iranians for entry into the 
United States have been 
declared invalid, effective 
immediately, and no visas win 
be issued or renewed "except 
for compelling and proven 
humanitarian reasons or 
where the national interest

reqUires. 

"The hostages and their 
families - indeed, all of us in 
America - have lived' with 
the reality and the anguish of 
their captivity for five 
months r " Carter said.

Tennis Team 
Breaks Streak 

The high. flying UCSD 
tennis team had some wind 
taken out of its sails yesterday 
afternoon when they dropped 
a lobsided 9·0 match to the 
University of San Diello. 
The loss dropped Tritons' 
record to 9·13, but more 
importantly is snapped a five 
match winning streak that 
UCSD had enjoyed. 

After struggling in the early 
stages of their season, the 
Tritons reeled off consecutive 
wins against William Jewell, 
Williams, New Mexico State 
University, and a pair of wins 
over Point Lorna College. 

The Tritons will be trying to 
regain their momentum over 
the next week which sees them 
on the road for three matches. 
The hectic road trip could 
wo~k against the UCSD squad 
if they cannot regain their 
winninB form. 

UCSD's next match is 
scheduled for this Friday when 
they travel north to face 
Harvey Mudd in a 3 pm start.

Klan Speaks at SDSU 
Conlinued Irom fXJlle 1 
that reported threats of guns, 
baseball bats and bottle 
throwing are nothing more 
than a "blowing up" of the 
affair. 

Metzger was invited, along 
with all other candidates vying 
for public office in San Diego 
County . to participate in the 
open forum. The AS, which 
issued the invitialions, did not 
believe his appearance should 
be considered an issue. 

"We believe in First 
Amendment Rights ," said· 
Kevin McCarthy, who stepped 
down as AS Vice President 
this week when new AS 
officers took office. "We are 
providing an open forum . . . 
we have no right to pick and 
choose." 

According to McCarthy, 
there was no contention about 
Metzger's appearance among 

the AS when the invitations 
were issued. "We're not going 
to protect (students) from 
hearing any opinions," he 
said. 

And, after meeting with 
various student organizations 
recently, the AS has little fear 
of organized violence from 
campus groups. 

"We aren' t in the least 
concerned that he is speaking 
on campus," logo Beard, 
Black Students Council 
president said. "We are 
entirely too intelligent and too 
sophisticated to address such 

. " an Issue. 
While Beard said he 

strongly opposes Klan 
activities, he added that 
Metzger has as much right as 
any other candidate to speak 
at today 's forum. "He's a 
member of the Klan . 
Whoopee. It's really no big 

issue." Beard said. 
Philosophy professor Tom 

Weston, active in the 
Committee Against Racism, a 
non-cal!lpus group which has 
most actively and vocally 
opposed Metzger's appea-
rance, said the AS is "doing a 
very wrong thing" in allowing 
Meztger to speak . 

While he denied rumors that 
CAR wiD try to incite violence, 
he emphasized that "we don't 
think in principles, but in 
tactics." These tactics, he 
admitted , are sometimes 
violent. 

At the least, Weston said, 
CAR members will protest 
Meztger's speech with banners 
and chanting. "We don't want 
things to go smoothly," he 
commented . 

Weston said campus police 
"are going to turn this place
