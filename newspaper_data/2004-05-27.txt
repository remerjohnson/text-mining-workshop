UCSD Healthcare 
pulls plug on SRTV 
By YUDlMII KOGAN 

Senior Stiff Writer 
UCSD Healthcare shut down 

the broadcast of Student Run 
Television for almost four days 
after receiving complaints from 
Thornton Hospital patients that 
the station aired "inappropriate" 
pornographic material on May 
15, according to station members 
and administrators. 

Campus officials said they dis-
covered that the Preuss School 
also received the station's trans-
missions after investigating the 
complaints. 

"There was no other alterna-
tive available to campus opera-
tions, because the risk of exposing 
the Preuss School children to 
indecent material was deemed 
sufficiendy high enough and it 
was of sufficiendy high priority to 
warrant the temporary disconnect 
of SRTV," said Nicholas S. 
Aguilar, director of Student 
Policies and Judicial Affairs. "Had 
there been an alternative to that, 
it would have been used." 

The ensuing delay, which kept 
SRTV from broadcasting until

Students who planned to show 
the video depicting the beheading 
of American civilian Nicholas Berg 
on Library Walle decided against 
doing so on May 25, while another 
student, who was informed by Earl 
Warren College administration 
that he could not screen the video 
on Warren College Television, 
plans to show it on Student Run 
Television. 

Thurgood Marshall College 
sophomore Ariel Mor had reserved 
space on Library Walle for the dis-
play through the Israel Action 
Committee student organization 
but withdrew his reservation after 
being informed of potential liabili-
ty by Assistant Director of Student 
Organizations Marcia A. Strong. 

A group of Mor's friends 
attempted to show the video on 
two televisions despite Mor's can-
celation. As they set up, university 
officials asked them to remove the 
equipment and leave or face disci-
plinary action.

The Universit'j Professional and 
Technical Employees Staff, which 
represents employees of the 
University Professional and 
Technical Employees union, has 
filed three unfair labor practice 
charges against UPTE. The union, 
which represents over 10,000 health 
care, research and technical employ-
ees at the University of California, 
announced it will layoff its nine-
member organizing staff effective in 
June. 

The charges include claims of 
retaliation against union officers 
for participating in a class-action 
lawsuit against the union, refusing 
to provide timely and complete 
information about the union's 
financial situation, bargaining in 
bad faith, and refusing to bargain 
over UPTE's changes to UPTE

The A.S. Council passed two 
resolutions on May 26 expressing 
its position on proposed plans to 
address the current budget crisis. 
The first criticizes many aspects 
of the compact agreement 
between Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger, UC President 
Robert C. Dynes and CSU 
Chancellor Charles B. Reed, 
including the lacle of student 
input in reaching the agreement, 
the possibility of decreased finan-
cial aid and cuts to outreach 
funding. The second supports 
keeping the firewall in the budget 
that currently separates under-
graduate and graduate fees being 
used for return to financial aid. 

Both resolutions passed by a 
vote of 20-0-3. 

Vice President External Rigo 
Marquez, who submitted both 
resolutions, said that while the 
compact recognizes the efforts to 
address student fee increases, the 
process in creating the compact 
was problematic because no stu-

dents were involved in the deci-
sion. He said that the University 
of California Student Association 
has also passed a similar resolu-
tion addressing the lack of input 
from students and state legisla-
tors. 

"Leaving out students and 
leaving out other state legi lators 
who have been part of the process 
really sets a precedent of the kind 
of relationship they want to have 
with UCSA and the state 
Legislature," Marquez said. 

The resolution states that the 
14-percent undergraduate stu-
dent fee increase - along with 
the possibility that the amount of 
money returned to financial aid 
would faJl from the current 33 
percent - would go against the 
California Master Plan for 
Higher Education. The resolu-
tion also states that the council is 
"disappointed in the neglect of 
student-initiated outreach," 
which according to the compact, 
will be funded solely through UC 
funds, not state funds. The com-

Internet down in Muir, 

Pepper canyon 
John Muir College residential facilities and 

Pepper Canyon apartments in Sixth College have 
been without Internet access since May 23 and 
are expected to regain access by the morning of 
May 27, Res Net officials said. Residents at Earl 
Warren College, Thurgood Marshall College and 
Revelle College were affected. 

A power outage at lhomton Hospital. which 
houses network services for approximately half 
of the university's residential halls, caused tem-
porary failure of cable modems in Muir, Pepper 
Canyon, Warren apartments, Marshall uppers, 
Matthews apartments and Revelle residential 
halls. The outage destroyed a piece of hard-
ware that affected Muir and Pepper Canyon 
connections. 

According to Erik Strahm, network project 
manager at ResNe~ students were left without 
Internet access because the hardware had to 
be ordered from a Canadian company and 
shipment was further delayed due to a 
Canadian national holiday. 

Undergraduates honored 
for research at UC Day 

Two UCSD undergraduates were among 16 
students selected from the nine UC campuses 
to present their research at the annual UC Day 
in Sacramento, Calif., on May 26. 

Honored with their faculty advisers, UCSD 
students Ben Maggos and Nick Statom dis-
played posters of their work in front of the gov-
ernor's office. 

Alumni associations from each UC campus 
use the event to promote issues related to the 
university and its contributions to the state. 

In addition to student honorees, four law-
makers received recognition for being

I l.S. COUNCIL AT A GLANCE 
MeetingM 

May 26, 2004 

Special Presentation 
Revelle College Senior Senator Ted 

McCombs announced that the A.S. Ad-Hoc 
Task Force to Compare and EvaJuate 
Marriage and Domestic Partnership 
BenefitsIPolicies at UCSD has finished its 
report and will distribute it to the council on 
June 2. Though the committee found that 
the university provides equal benefits for 
both married couples and domestic parmers, 
McCombs said the report concludes that 
same-sex pairs lose out on substantial feder-
al tax benefits. In addition, children of 
domestic partners are not currently e1igi hie 
for exemptions that allow selected out-of-
state students to pay in-state tuition. 

Reports 
Commissioner of Enterprise Opentions 
Angela Fomero 

Fornero reported that Grove Caffe 
increased its profits by more than ten per-
cent in a single week after the eatery began 
accepting meal points. In addition, A.S. 
Lecture Notes will provide notes during the 
summer session for the first time this year. 

Earl Warren CoUege Interim Freshman 
Senator Todd Tolin 

Tolin announced that statistics recently 
reported to the Academic Senate's 
Representative Assembly show more than 
4,100 admitted students confirmed their 
intention to attend UCSD in the fall . The 
number is 17 percent more than the 3,500 
yield campus administrators had anticipated. 

Council Caucus 
Commissioner of Student Services Kian 

Maleki explained that his analysis of data 

from the Triton Taxi program showed evi-
dence of "abuse" by selected individuals. A 
single student used the service II times in 
winter quarter and some users gave false 
names to drivers, including "Seymour 
Butts," Maleki said. In two straw polls, more 
than two-thirds of councilmembers 
expressed support for limiting the service to 
no more than three shuttles in a single night 
and to increase the maximum wait time for 
students, which is currently capped at 40 
minutes, to help cut down operation costs. 

Old Business 
Item A 

The council voted by consensus to 
amend its media allocations by apportioning 
$800 to student publication "Future & 
Finance," on the condition that the organi-
zation promises to reduce the amount of 
advertisements md increase the amount of 
student input on the paper. 

ItemD 
Senators voted by consensus to allocate 

$165 for the purchase of an Xbox video 
game system for former student Evan 
Rowley. Rowley had won an Xbox more 
than two years earlier at an event hosted by 
Associated Students but the system was 
stolen before Rowley received it, according 
to A.S. advisor Lauren Weiner. 

ItemQ 
Deciding h¥ consensus, the council 

adopted a resolution calling on textbook 
publishers to lower the cost of educational 
materials by providing online versions of 
textbooks, allowing access to older editions 
of books and selling them without bundling 
the books with other "bells and whistles." 
The resolution followed a CalPIRG report 
on the same subject.

said. "The school never 
tried to cancel on us. The

Mor said he felt that

THURSDAY, MAY 27. 200<4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Assembly passes textbook rental bill 
Legislation encourages colleges to rent books 
If NAllGES ZOHOUIY 

Daily Bruin (U. California-Los 
Angeles) 

(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES -
A bill providing guidelines for 
implementations of a textbook 
rental program in the state's public 
colleges passed the California 
Assembly on May 20 with bipartisan 
support. 

The bill, which will now move 
on to the state Senate, was intro-
duced by Assemblyman Paul 
Koretz (D-West Hollywood) and 
sponsored by the California Public 
Interest Research Group. 

"The bill is not a mandate on 
schools, but a strong encourage-
ment," said Mark Thornton, 
CalPIRG state board chainnan and 
one of the coordinators of the 
affordable textbooks program. 

He explained that the bill does 
not force any higher education 
institution to implement the rental 
program, but provides guidelines 
for them. 

Thorton added that the bill 

encourages schools to decrease the 
cost of higher education. 

According to a May 20 press 
release, the rental program caps 
textbook rental fees at 50 percent 
of the COSt of purchasing books, a 
measure that many students said 
would benefit them. 

Angelina Garefis, a senior biol-
ogy student at UCLA, said she has 
spent up to $ 140 on a single book. 
and got less than half that when she 
sold the book back. 

"If the loss of me buying the 
Qook is greater tharl me renting it, 
I would definitely rent a book.," 
Garefis said. 

Thornton said there are a num-
ber of ways for the cost of text-
books to be lowered, and this is 
only one of them. 

Even with the support of all par-
ties involved, including campus 
administration, the recent budget 
cuts could get in the way of UCLA 
introducing the new program. 

"[Right now) is a rough time to 
start this program," said Jolene 
Mitchell , CalPIRG chapter chair-

woman at UCLA, referring to the 
cuts that the university is experi-
encing. 

Mitchell said she would Iik.e to 
see the campus take part in the pro-
gram, and added that she and her 
group, which has been working 
with Koretz, would be willing to 
cooperate with administrators to 
help publicize the rental program. 

Textbook rental services are cur-
rently in place at 20 U.S. colleges 
and universities. The bill also gives 
students the option of purchasing 
the books after renting them. 

"Rental programs make more 
used books available for purchase, 
allow substantial savings for Stu-
dents - whether they are buying 
or renting their books - and can 
actually make more money for 
bookstores," Koren said in a press 
release. "This is a no-brainer." 

Mitchell said the bill's passing is 
a step forward and shows that legis-
lators see there is a problem with 
the cost of textbooks. 

"Publishers should take note of 
that," she said. 

Berg: Media coverage prompted cancellation 
contin~d from page :l 

dents with a means of viewing the 
video, according (0 Mor's friends. 

"Unfortunately, the American 
population, including a lot of stu-
dents, doesn't have access to [the 
videoJ, are ignoring it and just 
haven't seen it," said Evan Epstein, 
a John Muir College senior who 
attempted to screen the video. "So, 
to formulate your opinions on 
what's actually happening - no 
maner what your opinion may be: 
pro-war or against war - you're 
entitled to your opinion; you need 
as much evidence as you can." 

Mor had called the event "pro-
American," and intended to rally 
support for American troops. 

News of the event prompted a 
UCSD staff member to protest the 
event. 

"I'm out here today to protest the 
motivation behind showing the 
video of the beheading of NICk 
Berg," said Glen MotiI, a library 
assistant and Gulf War veteran. 
"[Bergs father) is an anti-war activist 
and he would be appalled that this is 
used to promote war, which was the 
clear point of view of this sroup." 

According to Aguilar, the indi-
viduals removed their equipment 
immediately after they were 
approached by university officials. 

"They acknowledged that they 
didn't have an approved reservation 
on file and they removed their 
equipment," Aguilar said. 

Mor supported the universityS 
decision. 

"The school did everything 
right," Mor said. "They allowed us 
to make the reservation. Marcia 
[Strong) was great, Nick Aguilar 
was great." 

Aguilar said that the display~ 
content had no bearing on the deci-
sion to shut it down. 

"It was determined that in the 
context of that display, it was 
intended to convey a political mes-
sage," Aguilar said. "It was protect-
ed under the First Amendment. We 
therefore would have no basis or 

interest in censoring speech on this 
campus. As long as the content is 
not clearly illegal, soch as defama-
tion, our policy does not take the 
content as a factor in determining 
whether to approve or disapprove 
the use." 

While some students expressed 
discomfort about showing the 
video on Library Walk., other stu-
dents supported the right of the 
organizers to display the video. 

"I haven't actually seen the 
video," said Marshall sophomore 
Jennifer Cho, whose booth recruit-
ing summer resident advisers was 
adjacent to the screens. "I kind of 
don't want to see it. My table was 
closer down there, and I moved it 
down here because I don't want to 
think about it." 

Earl Warren College junior 
Jacob Rupp felt that students 
should see the video and called for 
the students to show it. 

"I think. it's a real shame that it 
wasn't broadcast," Rupp said. "The 
campus needs to see what~ going 
on in the world today, and a visual 
representation that they made of 
the barbarity that~ going on is the 
only way people can undentand 
why we're over there ... I hope that 
the people who put this on will per-
severe and show it." 

The Israel Action Conuninee 
has no affiliation with the San 
Diego Israel Alliance. 

On May 26, Warren administra-
tion officials infonned Warren 
junior Daniel Watts that he would 
not be allowed to screen the video 
on his weekly Warren College 
Television show "perfect Vision," on 
May 27 as he had planned. 

Watts previously showed a clip 
from the video on his show, which 
airs live, on May 13, and the Vnion-
TriJnme reported on May 26 that he 
was planning to show the video 
again. 

"It's important to understand 
that unlike Library Walk., wcrv 
is a learning library owned by 
Warren, nut by Residential Life, 

with strong support from its student 
staff, but there are rules and regula-
tions to be followed," Warren 
College Dean Jeff Philpott s:.id. 

Philpott said these rules include 
college policies that wcrv mater-
ial should not include any "lewd, 
indecent or shocking" material. 
Students participating in the station 
don't agree to these in writing but 
the policies are "expressly" agreed 
to, as with the UCSD Student 
Handbook, according to Philpott. 

Watts claims that he has never 
seen any codified guidelines for the 
station, and that the c1osed-circuit 
cable station does not have to fol-
low Federal Communications 
Commission pidelines. 

According to the Student Press 
Law Center, courts have ruled that 
if a school creates a television sta-
tion and allows students to serve as 
its editors, the First Amendment 
"drastically limits the school's abil-
ity to censor," and prohibits prior 
review, removing objectionable 
material and suspending editors. 

"I found it ironic that so much 
media attention was given to some-
thing that didn't even happen," 
Watts said, referring to Mor's plan. 
"People were expecting to see it, so 
it was something that was impor-
tant to campus debate." 

Watts plans to broadcast his show 
on SR1V instead of wcrv at II 
p.rn. on May 27. 

Warren Residential Life Dean 
Clare Palmer said she will conduct 
a review of Watts' May 13 WCTV 
show. She said she was unaware 
Watts screened clips of the video in 
question. 

"I was absolutely livid," Palmer 
said. "I need some answers about 
what happened two weeks ago, and 
it will take a few days of going 
through this with a fine-toothed 
comb to understand this." 

Wcrv; like SRTY, serves the 
entire campus as well as Thornton 
Hospital and the Preuss School. 

[&J. Note: DlI1Iiel Wirtts is the 
Opinion &Jitor of the Guardian.] 

SRTV: S~ation broadcast halted for four days 
continued from po(t! J 

midday on May 19, was a result of 
the university's investigation and 
the time required to install a con-
tent fi Iter to remove the station 
from the Preuss School and UCSD 
Healthcare, which both subscribe 
to Triton Cable, Aguilar said. 

"I really think. we have a right to 
be told something if they're going 
to lcick us off the air," said Revelle 

College junior Chelsea Welch, the 
station's programming director. 

Because Thornton patients and 
employees who found the material 
offensive have refused to describe 
it, according to Welch and station 
manager Jared Lindo, SRlV mem-
bers have yet to figure out whether 
the broadcast was part of regular 

~tion programming or if a breu-
In occurred . 

Though SR1V members con-
tacted campus police to notify them 
of a security breach, they say they 
found no signs of forced entry. 
SRTV's security system, which 
requires each person to use a per-
sonal code to gain entry into the 
station and keeps a record of those 
who enter, also showed that no one

The UCSD Guardian is published twice a week at the University of California at San Diego. 
Contents eel 2004. Views expressed herein represent the majority VOle of the editorial board

Guardian staff. 

University had no right 
to shut down SRTV 

N o laws were broken, no formal olicies 
violated, but ~tudent 

Run Television was hut 
down for almost four days 
last week because it 
allegedly broadcast porno-
graphic material. 

SRTV is broadcast on 
closed-circuit cable, so its 
editorial content is not 
obliged to comply with the 
Federal Communications 
Commission standards that 
apply to regular broadcast 
stations. And as a public 
university, UCSD cannot 
exercise authority over the 
editorial content of stu-
dent-run media like SRTV; 
according to the Student 
Press Law Center. 

But UCSD Healthcare 
(which houses facilities 
used by Triton Cable) 
interrupted the SRTV 

broadcast on May 15, and 
the university kept the sta-
tion from broadcasting for 
days when there was no 
established campus proto-
col that dictated such 
action was acceptable. 

UCSD Healthcare 
should have consulted with 
SRTV to solve the problem 
instead of making the rash 
and unfounded decision to 
take matters into its own 
hands. The channels of 
communication between the 
university and SR1V should 
have been more open at 
each step of the process. 

Now UCSD Healthcare 
and Preuss School are fil-
tering SR1V from their 
systems entirely - exactly 
what they should have done 
in the first place if they 
objected to some of the sta-
tion's content. 

Video sparks debate 
and media coverage 

T he prospect of screenIng the much publicized Nicholas 
Berg beheading in public 
spaces at UCSD has pulled 
students, administrators 
and members of the media 
into a debate over free 
speech and the political 
weight of the footage. 

Thurgood Marshall 
College sophomore Ariel 
Mor's plans to air the video 
repeatedly on Library Walk 
on May 25 drew enough 
media coverage to prompt 
him to cancel the event, and 
on May 26 Earl Warren 
College administrators told 
Warren junior Daniel 
Watts that showing the 

foota~e on Warren College 
TeleVision would violate 
wcrv I?o Ii cy. 

The Vldeo, which major 
American news outlets 
refused to broadcast, shows 
the beheading of Berg, an 
American civilian, by 
masked men identified as 
al-Qaeda members. 

As shocking a the video 
is, the fact that the murder 
depicted was the actual 
death of a real human and 
not a Hollywood reenact-
ment makes it a powerful 
political testimony to the 
state of affairs in Iraq. 

In this respect, the Berg 

video is a legitimate piece of 
infonnation that Americans 
should be able to view in 
order to make their own 
decisions about larger 
themes of war, violence and 
free speech. Both Mor and 
Watts should be able to 
show the video in whatever 
legal venue they deem 
appropriate, especially on 
such a beacon of free expres-
sion as a university campus. 

However, attention 
should be paid to their 
intentions. Mor's screening 
was to be a self-froclaimed 
"pro-American event, 
intended to rally the cam-
pus in support of U.S. 501-
<iiers in a fit of disgust and 
thirst for vengeance 
toward Berg's muroerers. 
It would have been cheap 
propaganda, attempting to 
generalize the conflict in 
Iraq. 

Watts, who plans to air 
the footage on Student Run 
Television on May 27, 
should use the video only as 
a means to promote open 
debate among students who 
choose to view it. 

The video contains bru-
tal images, but ones worthy 
of discussion on a unjversi-
ty campus.

• I LEnERS TO THE EDITOR 
2005 A.S. budget is 

fiscally irresponsible 
Editor: 

I am writing today with grave 
concerns regarding the proposed 
A.S. Executive Budget that 
appeared in the A.S. Council's 
May 19 agenda proposed by A.S. 
President Jenn Pae. I will outline 
two of my concerns. The policy 
of this budget seems to be "spend 
now, hopefully (if we have the 
money) pay later." The A.S. 
Council budget is not a credit 
card. 

After speaking to Pae, I am 
very concerned that the proposed 
budget has large flaws that are 
extremely fiscally irresponsible. 

The A.S. Council must main-
tain its fiscal accountability as 
many events and organizations 
use our budget to plan their activ-
ities. In addition, as Senate Chair 
and Co-op Oversight Chair Kate 
Pillon can verify, Associated 
Students is the fiscal agent for all 
the co-ops on campus. We cannot 
realize that halfway through the 
year we are in debt, and take 
money from events and groups 
that were expecting it. 

The budget does not account 
for Enterprise Office revenue or 
monies for stipends to run the 
A.S .. Services. In general, 
AsSOCIated Students spends near-
ly $50,000 to run the A.S. 
Services. These include such ser-
vices as the Academic Success 
Program, Volunteer 
Connections, KSDT, Student 

Run Television and more. By not 
accounting for the Enterprise 
revenue or the monies to run the 
A.S. Services, Pae is taking a 
huge risk that the Enterprise rev-
enue will be enough to pay for 
the services. This risle. is fiscally 
irresponsible and blatantly 
wrong. 

My other major concern is 
Pae's plan to pay A.S.P' $11,000 
in winter and 57,000 in spring to 
operate their service instead of 
accounting for their total budget 
now. Although this plan sounds 
good right now (and frees up 
money for other things), I ques-
tion where President Pae plans 
on the $18,000 coming from. 
The budget states that it will be 
from "General Unallocated," but 

I question how that money will 
be there, being that her current 
budget only has $6,000 in the 
General Unallocated pot. 

I feel that this plan maintains 
no fiscal responsibility.' First, the 
point of the Executive Budget is 
to account for all known income 
and expenditures, which this 
clearly does not. Second, by stat-
ing in the budget that 
"Distribution for winter 
(511,000) and spring (57,000) will 
be from General Unallocated 
upon budget request," she makes 
the claim that this budget some-
how · authorizes the expenditure, 
but does not account for the actu-
al expense: Item 17 totals 
$24,000 rather than the total-year 
cost of 542,000. 

I suggest that Pae follow the 
lead of the past A.S. presidents 
and take an educated estimate 
(albeit, a conservative estimate) to 
include in the budget. Then, the 
A.S. Services stipends can be allo-
cated appropriately. Also, Pae 
needs to include all known 
income and expenses (such as 
A.S.P.) in the budget. It is an out-
landish notion that we will just 
"pay for it later" when we know 
of the expense now. 

. Finally, I want to convey my 
dismay that Pae seemingly did 
not even seriously consider my 
concerns. Although she cam-
paigned to "open the budget 
process to all students," I felt like 
my opinion was not validated.

THURSDAY, MAY 27, 2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5 

Pride and certainty can only tarnish years at UCSD 
Campus' Intellectual depth can never be fully explored nor distilled 

horse's 
mouth 

EdWu 

T his columnist has an admission to make. Two years ago, he almost left 
this school after applying for 
transfers to Ivy Lea~es, mostly 
due to arrogance. The attitude he 
expressed is often seen at UCSD: 
"I am better than this school." 
Few and far between is the stu-
dent who has since childhood 
pined to mill about the eucalyp-
tus-laden paths of our school. 
Instead, we get the progeny of 
Berkeley graduates who feel they 
were unjustly rejected from their 
parents' alma mater, aspiring 
journalists who could not get into 
NYU or Chicago, and Southern 
California teenagers who have 
admired the glamour of UCLA 
half their lives without getting 
there. How many of us hung 
UCSD pennants in our bedrooms 
before we knew we were coming 
here? Who among us cheered for 
UCSD teams, or wore UCSD 
para phernalia in the halls of our 
high schools before May 1 of 
senior year? 

And 50 I stood two years ago 
on the precipice of the Pacific, 
secure in my knowledge that the 
system had erred. I would hope 
that since then, I have accepted 
thlt the system worked in the first 
place, and there is no way I could 
have ever exhausted the intellec-

tual opportunities available at 
UCSD. That intellectual arro-
gance, that persistence of convic-
tion, pervades this campus beyond 
this writer. It can be seen not only 
in the freshmen who are certain 
they should be at Berkeley and 
plan to apply for transfer at their 
first opportunity, but also in the 
chair-throwing hysterics of stu-
dent government candidates 
denied their rightful offices by a 
judicial committee who dares 
exercise moral judgment over an 
election. It can be seen in the 
intellectual arrogance of graduate 
students using class or section 
time to rant about the illegitimacy 
of the federal government. It can 
be seen in the polemics of right 
and evil in either the C"lifo,.,,;1I 
Rroit'lJ) or the Nt11J J"di,lIttJr - the 
papers are symmetric under inter-
change in verbs and adjectives, 
and differ only in nouns. It can be 
seen in the smug satisfaction or 
condescending sorrow for your 
lost soul from evangelizing 
Christians inviting random 
passersby to their congregations. 

Maybe that's how the real 
world actually is. Maybe nearly 
every individual believes that they 
are morally right, justified and 
completely correct in denouncing 
the views of our politicians, our 
institutions, our admissions 
offices, our school administration 
or other students. Then again, 
should not a university promote 
open thought? Is it too much to 
ask that critical thinking come 
with an uncertainty of conviction? 
Would it really be that much of a 
blow to who we are to freely 
admit that our views on religion, 

politics, equality, social order or 
college admissions might very 
well be incorrect? This writer 
cannot imagine it would be a sign 
of weakness to admit that one's 
cherished viewpoints could be 
erroneous. 

And so, this is the last Horse's 
Mouth, after three years of spew-
ing forth myriad viewpoints that 
may well have infuriated most of 
the population of this campus at 
one time or another, all in a tone 

" How many of US hung UCSD pennants in our 
bedrooms befare we knew 

we were coming here? 
Who among us cheered 
far UCSD teams, ar 

wore UCSD 
paraphernalia in the halls 
of our high schools befare 
May 1 of senior year?" 

of moral certitude and the arro-
gance of vaguely intellectual con-
demnation. Some notable gems: 

... Ironically enough, Mr. 
Aguilar's attempt to shield his 
uncovered rear has changed little, 
since the original argument 
remains legally valid. If the uni-
versity has identified a violation of 
federal law - namely, the hyper-

link - and refuses to shut it 
down, it is an accomplice in 
crime. Mr. Aguilar has but added 
one more misdeed to the adminis-
tration's list: censorship. 

... Now, while Course and 
Professor Evaluations works hard 
over the school year and summer 
to bring us paragraphs .. . they are 
by and large useless to anyone 
actually trying to get a handle on 
how the course and professors 
rate. 

... In essence, pushing back the 
effective date of the fee increase is 
an irresponsible ploy to garner 
additional votes. But nobody said 
the damn thing would ever be run 
efficiently anyway. All one needs 
to do is look at the exorbitantly 
expensive signs telling us to vote 
next week. 

... For all their talk of public 
service, striking in order to make 
public service in the future worse 
while appealing to [the teaching 
assistants') position as public ser-
vants does little to garner sympa-
thy from this corner. 

... If we are led to believe 
through our admissions systems 
that underrepresented minorities 
are prepared for higher education 
despite their atrocious treatment 
at the hands of the state, then we 
as a society can believe we have 
achieved social justice, and only 
the few of us who dare look 
beyond the racial breakdown of 
admissions statistics will be aware 
of the full magnitude of our fail-
ure. This is a lie that cannot be 
abided. 

... While the best way to deal 
with this kind of attention-seek-
ing idiocy (both the shredder and 

the Koala) is probably just to 
ignore it, this vitriol can perhaps 
be justified because at least the 
KoaUt has acknowledged its own 
attention-seeking demagoguery, 
while the Thurgood Marshall 
College shredder operators have 
yet to show that much wisdom. In 
all honesty, this writer believes 
that while there are people who 
are fighting to make the campus a 
better place for just motives, any-
one who would resort to these 
sorts of shock tactics is posing 
amoral ambition as self-righteous 
indignation. 

This writer hopes, in any case, 
that he contributed to the debate 
on this campus over the past three 
years, but urges anyone who both-
ers to read his columns to take his 
viewpoints and their own with a 
grain of salt. For all that I opine, 
for all that I condemn, I remem-
ber in the past two years I have 
learned that the undergraduates 
of this school and the readers of 
this column, whether they agree 
with me or not, have a depth and 
intelligence that, in my arrogance, 
I could not see while applying for 
transfer two years ago. This 
writer most emphatically does not 
regret staying, and thanks his 
readers for their kind attention 
and constant input. 

This column stands for egalitar-
ian principles. As a result, all corre-
spondence sent to 
e2wu@ucsd.edu will be treated 
with the same amount of incom-
petence. Three years of horse 
drool can be found at

UPTE: Staff claims firing is retribution 
continued from page I 

conditions. 
The union issued layoff 

notices to all nine of its organiz-
ing staff, but rehired four under 
the new job title of Leadership 
Development Coordinator, which 
is currently unrepresented. 
U PTE Staff President Carla 
Williams, who was placed on paid 
leave and was not rehired, said the 
laid-off staff are seeking an 
injunction with the National 
Labor Relations Board to stop the 
layoffs. 

Williams claims that the 
union 's justifications for the lay-
offs, which include a call for reor-
ganization, are characteristic of 
UC moves the union has protest-
ed in the past. 

"It's not at all unusual for an 
employer to do thi s, and UPTE, 
in its dealings with us, is acting 
like a typical employer," Williams 
said. "yve think it's disgraceful 
that the employer who is doing 
this is actually a labor union . Most 
of us, when we thinlc. of wuons, 
thinx of them as protecting 
employees' rights, not violating 
them." 

Carolan Buckmaster, vice pres-
ident of UPTE's San Diego 
branch, said the reason for the lay-
offs was due to both financial con-
straints and II desire for reorgarti-
za rion. 

The new positions, she said, 
will include one organizer for 
each campus. Although the orga-
nizer will be paid more, the 
smaller number of staff will help 
limit costs to the union . The 
organizers will then work in con-
juction with additional local 
union members. 

"The idea behind it is to build 

leadership on our union - we 
don't want the face of UPTE to 
be non-UC employees," said 
Buckmaster, who is a staff 
research assistant at UCSD. She 
added that the current system 
wasn 't working. "II's most effec-
tive when members talk to non-
members. We found this very 
obvious." 

Williams, however, claims that 
the reorganization firings were 
made in retaliation against employ-
ees the union "doesn't lixe." 

"UPTE has claimed in the 
past that the urtiversity has used 
reorgartization to get rid of staff 
they don't like," she said . "In 
UPTE Staff's opinion, we see 
UPTE using that same method 
to get rid of their staff that they 
don't like." 

Not all of the organizing staff 
were given interviews for the new 
position. Two that were laid off 
were participants in a class-action 
lawsuit against the union disput-
ing wages and hours. she said. 
Williams claimed that this could 
intimidate potential participants 
in the lawsuit and that she herself 
was fired in retaliation for her par-
ticipation in protected, concerted 
activi ties. 

The union was held in con-
tempt of court in December for 
issuing layoff notices "for lack of 
funds," which was implied to be 
because of the price o( the court 
case, according to Williams. 11tis 
went against a judge order that 
there would be no solicitation of 
potential members of the class-
action case to opt out of the law-
suit. 

On May 29, the union will be 
judged in court as to whether or 
not it is in contempt of court for 

the most recent layoff notices. 
"There are only two [of the 

orgartizing stafi) who are in the 
lawsuit, and if it was retaliation, I 
don't thinlc. we would be laying 
them all off," Buckmaster said. 
"We wouldn't go to this much 
trouble to restructure the way we 
want to do things if it was retalia-
tion to the lawsuit." 

Williams claims that the new 
positions are very similar to the 
old positions, including many of 
the same responsibilities. UPTE 
Staff and the union also disagree 
on whether adequate information 
on the union's financial status was 
provided to the staff upon 
request. 

Williams and the other laid-
off employees were given leave 
with pay until the official termi-
nation of their employment on 
June 7. 

"Since we gave them two 
months' notice of layoffs, we 
decided they haven't been work-
ing much so we should just let 
them go," Buckmaster said. "We 
decided for everybody's sake, it 
would be better if they could focus 
on getting a new job. That works 
out for them as well as us." 

Williams said she does not 
expect an injunction to go 
through before June, but said that 
even afterward, the employees 
could regain their jobs. Until 
then, they plan to publicize their 
situation. 

"We are hoping that not just 
UPTE members, but also people 
in the larger labor and UC com-
munity, will join with us in hold-
ing the union accountable," she 
said. "We have to represent our 
coworkers to the best of our abili-
ty." 

1liURSDAY, MAY .27..2004 

Hospital: SRTV to meet 
with Thornton, Triton cable 

cllNinNed from page J 
was in the studio when the incident 
happened. 

"Our number-one concern is to 
see what the offending content 
was," Lindo said. "We can't fix the 
problem if we don't know what it 
is." 

Closed-circuit cable sutions 
like SRTV are exempt from 
Federal Communications 
Commission guidelines, which 
state broadcast stations may not air 
"language or material, that in con-
text, depicts or describes, in terms 
patendy offensive ... sexual or 
excretory organs or 1ctivities." 

The regulations ban all obscene 
materials and restrict the airing of 
"indecent" or "profane" content 
between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. 

Though the station is exempt 
from the FCC regulations, it vol-
untarily adopted the daytime con-
tent policy earlier this year. 

SRTV's 40 hours of replay 
material televised during daytime 
hours is programmed into a pass-
word-protected computer and does 
not contain any indecent material, 
according to Welch. 

While original complaints 
allege the broadcast was obscene, 
Aguilar said an investigation fol-
lowing the incident found no viola-
tions of campus policy or federal 
law on the part of the station. 

"We acted on the nature of that 
complaint," be said. "Subsequently, 
I think it was determined that the 
material was permitted for broad-
cast over a cable station, as long as 
it is at a time that there is a hiKb 
degree of certainty that only aduTts 
will have access." 

Both Welch and Lindo, who 

believe that some of the station's 
replay content may offend viewers, 
said Triton Cable users had the 
responsibility of being aware of 
what they had subscribed to. They 
argue that the decision to end all of 
the station's transmission was not 
made by campus admirtistrators, 
but by Thornton employees with-
out prior approval. 

"The idea that someone has the 
power to simply unplug us from the 
campus is the most upsetting part, 
regardless of what was being 
shown," Lindo said. He said that in 
the past, offended viewers submit-
ted complaints through the sta-
tion's AS. adviser for internal reso-
lution. 

Aguilar dertied the allegation 
that campus officials were not made 
aware of the decision. However, the 
campus bas no official protocol for 
dealing with content disputes, 
Aguilar said. The development of 
one will be the focus of an ongoing 
review, sparked by the incident, 
that looks into campus broadcast-
ing policies. 

"It's unfortunate that this mate-
rial was broadcast, and it's unfor-
tunate that the campus had no 
alternative but to temporarily dis-
connect SR1V in order to ensure 
that we were not exposing the 
minor students at the Preuss 
School to material that clearly was 
not intended for [minorsl," he 
said. 

SRTV officers said they plan to 
hold a meeting with Thornton and 
Triton Cable officials to attempt 
to identify the source of the offen-
sive content and develop proce-
dures for handling viewer com-
plaints. 

A.5.: Council votes to support keeping retum,to aid level at 33 percent 
continued from page I 

pact currently allocates $ I2 million 
for K-12 outreach programs to be 
divided within the UC system. 

"There is fluctuation of finan-
cial aid that is problematic because 
you're increasi ng tuition, but try-
ing to cut financial aid," Marquez 
sa Id . "The compact also complete-
ly avoids discussion of student ini-
tiated outreach. [The current pro-
posal] is 20 percent of [the current] 
budget that outreach programs 
work on." 

The resolution also calls for the 
UC Office of the President, the 
UC Board of Regents and other 
leaders to create a more "equitable, 
viable and beneficial solution" to

address the current budget issues. 
The resolution will be sent to the 
governor's office, UCOP, the UC 
Academic Senate and other appro-
priate organizations. 

"I'm happy that A.S. has chosen 
to take a stance on the compact, 
and I think that it's really impor-
tant that access to education is 
preserved and fees aren't raised," 
said Eleanor Roosevelt College 
junior Harish Nandagopal, a 
member of Stop the Cuts 
Coalition at UCSD 

The second resolution adopted 
by the council calls for the UC 
admirtistration to maintain the fire-
wall that allocates money returned 
from the graduate student fee 

increase to financial aid specifically 
for graduate students. The retum-
to-aid money from undergraduate 
fees goes specifically toward under-
graduate financial aid. 

According to Revelle Senior 
Senator Ted McCombs, who co-
sponsored both resolutions, finan-
cial aid for graduate students is cur-
rently merit-based while financial 
aid for undergraduate students is 
based on financial need. 

"Since these financial aids are 
very different from each other and 
have different goals, we want to 
keep the firewall the same so that 
graduate money doesn't go to 
undergraduate financial aid, and 
undergraduate money doesn't go to

graduate financial aid," McCombs 
said. 

The resolution states that the 
current proposal to remove the 
firewall would put undergraduate 
and graduate systems in conOict 
with one another. The resolution 
also states tha t the council would 
reject any future budget proposals 
that increase undergraduate fees to 
lower graduate fees. 

"Keeping the firewall protects 
undergraduates - to undo the fire-
wall puts a lot of burden on the 
undergraduates who are usually 
most in need of financial aid," 
Thurgood Marshall College 
Freshman Senator Allan Horowitz 
said. "It hurts them, and under-

graduate money needs to stay with 
the undergraduate population." 

McCombs amended the r'!SOlu-
tion to reiterate that the council 
supports maintaining the return-
to-aid amount at B percent of 
undergraduate fees, following for-
mer Thurgood Marshall College 
Student Council Chair Travis 
Silva's request to address the issue. 

"The compact gives the UC 
Board of Regents latitude to make 
that number between 20 percent 
to H percent," Silva said. "The 
lower [the number is], the less 
financial aid will be available. 
What the council should be doing 
is to take this issue into considera-
tion."

VOl Alta a haven for multicultural art, performance 
Community-minded exhibition space strives for accessibility, diversity of voice 

By JESSICA VACHAL 
Staff Writer 

In the heart of San Diego's East Village lies Voz Alta, a smail, unassuming space that is the 
home for local artists of all art 
forms and backgrounds. The Voz 
Alta Project is a nonprofit organi-
zation that is dedicated to "com-
munity empowerment with a cross-
cultural approach," according to 
Dawn Rotundo, the exhibitions 
and events assistant for the project. 

Started in 1999 by a group 
known as the Taco Shop Poets, the 
project initially worked with 
ChicanolLatino youth and literacy 
issues. This collaboration has 
grown to include a number of com-
munity members and fellow artists 
and acti~sts, who all worked at 
local schools around the county to 
conduct a range of workshops. 

The Taco Shop Poets them-
selves are a group of artists devot-
ed to creating community empow-
erment through the arts. As a 

Voz Alta vision: Tuan Andrev.' Nguyen seeks to incorporate the viewer into his 
pieces, exploring the relationship between pop culture. spirituality and violence. 

group, they recognize the intangi-
ble treasures tha t are unique to 
each community and iliat show 
iliemselves ilirough various artistic 
mediums. The Poets view me taco 
shops, which became their name-
sake, as "flavored places of culture 
and celebration, where all walks of 
life collide for a brief moment." 
Made up of poets and musicians 
who hail from places as varied as 
ilie southern parts of Mexico to 
Mississippi and San Francisco, the 
Taco Shop Poets work togeilier to 
spread the love of the art inherent 
within different cultures. 

Although it was founded by and 
along the political lines of 
Chicanos and Latinos, the project 
has expanded its ~sion to form a 
space that welcomes and houses a 
multiplicity of art forms including 
visual and performing art. 

Since settling in its own space in 
2001, Voz Alta has been able to 
host a wider range of artists ilian it 
had before. 

"[Saying] that this is strictly a 
Chicano and Latino space is wrong, 
although that is the popular mis-
conception that surrounds Voz 
Alta," Rotundo said. "[Voz Alta] 
plays host to groups and individuals 
that come from and represent 
many different communities, 
racially, culturally, socioeconomi-

cally, sexually (and) geographical-
ly." 

Voz Alta itself is a very multi-
functional space. In addition to 
hosting visual art exhibitions and 
workshops, the space also hosts lec-
tures and performances, which 
include dramatic presentations, 
poetry readings, live music and per-
formance art. 

Past exhibitions hosted by ilie 
Voz Alta Project include a group 
exhibition titled "Arabs 
Anonymous/No Hay Moros," 
which featured American, 
Canadian and Latino artists of 
Middle Eastern and Jewish descent. 
Omer exhibitions showcased vari-
ous emerging and established 
artists such as Valerie Aranda, 
Patrick "Paton Hebert, Ribardo 
Islas, Ruben Ochoa and Gerardo 
Yepiz. 

Having just closed their most 
recent exhibition of a solo show for 
Aya Seko, a Japanese-American 
artist, the Voz Alta Project is look-
ing forward to a slew of new exhibi-
tions slated to be showcased in the 
coming monms. Included in this 
lineup is Tuan Andrew Nguyen, a 
Vietnamese artist who works out of 
Los Angeles. His show, "Whlile 
Dodging Fake Bullets in me Dark," 
focuses on the relationship between 
violence, pop culture and spiritual-

ity. 
In addition to featuring promi-

nent artists from San Diego, Los 
Angeles and Mexico, the Voz Alta 
Project strives to make itself av~il­
able to residents of these areas who 
may not be professional artists. 

Every other Monday of each 
monili, the Voz Alta Project has an 
open mic night titled "3rd Word," 
which gives amateurs an opportu-
nity to 6eld their own music and 
verse, while encouraging dialogue 
with omer poets and musicians. In 
addition to providing a forum for 
people to express themselves, this 
open-mic night also strives to 
uphold the Voz Alta Project's self-
proclaimed mission of being social-
ly conscious. To this end, the open 
mic promotes community involve-
ment through diverse art forms 
while at the same time welcoming 
people of all cultures, orientations 
and opinions. 

Voz Alta also offers "aruja y 
Bellas." Meeting the second and 
fourth Tuesdays of every monm 
within the Voz Alta space, this is a 
group of women writers who sup-
port each omer in developing and 
nurturing their creative talents. 

The Voz Alta Project makes it a 
point to extend its arms to the com-

many points throughout the

repetitive and bland. It is 
the perfect study mus ic 
because despite the strange 
mixture of pleasant 
melodies and amagonistic 
vocals, the songs fail to 
stand out. The few that

Radiohead - in other 
words, they sound like a 
terrib le mistake. The mix-
ture's strangeness is mildly 
attractive, but at moments 
the moving instrumental 
music completely clashes 
with the vocals. This polar-
ity is particularly poignant 
in "Hawks," which contains 
a peculiar blend of emo-

But ilie more pressing prob-

ideas, such as ilie Spanish 
lyrics of "Todo los Dolores," 
are broken up by good ones 
such as ilie upbeat guitar

'We Dance/Out Dances' pays 
tribute to legend Gregory Hines 

Hudson disappoints in 'Raising Helen' 
Attempts at poignancy can't save this bland wannabe blockbuster 

Annual spring dance show lets students 
choreograph performance for major venue 

By JESSICA VACHAL 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD Theatre and Dance Department's annual spring dance festival hits Mandeville 
Auditorium this weekend. This 
year 's festival, "We Dance/Our 
Dances" will feature UCSD dance 
majors performing an array of 
dances, including a tribute to leg-
endary tap dancer and actor Gregory 
I-lines, who passed away in 2003 at 
the age of 57 from liver cancer. 

Choreographed by Kellee 
T hompson, this tribute includes 
her own choreography and will also 
recreate ~ances from a handful of 
Hines' films. Thompson said that 
she has been a fan of Hines' work 
for years. 

" I was able to take a class from 
[Hines) in 2001 in L.A., and 1 just 
remember being able to talk to him 
after class and ask him questions," 
Thompson said. "He actually 
stayed after the class was over and 
talked to me personally for about 
half an hour answering my ques-
tions until his driver actually made 
him leave ... I just wanted to show 
everyone what a great man he was 
and that he was a wonderful dancer 
as welL" 

In addition to this tap dance 
tribute, "We Dance/Our Dances" 
will highlight a combination of 
styles including modern, jazz, 
contemporary movement and hip-
hop inspired dance . Other dance 
pieces within the concert will 

integrate live music , video and 
sign language into the context of 
the movements. 

This concen is choreographed 
by ) I UCSD dance majors that 
were selected from a group of 16 
candidates by a panel of judges 
from the UCSD dance faculty. 

One of these faculty members, 
Jean Isaacs, is the director of this 
year's concen. A distinguished edu-
cator in modern dance who special-
izes in teaching technique, chore-
ography and improvisation, Isaacs 
is also well known around San 
Diego for her commissioned work 
in such prestigious venues as the 
Old Globe, the La Jolla Playhouse 
and the San Diego Opera. 

"What I'm doing as director is 
I kind of offer input about the 
dances, what parts might be 
changed, how the program might 
be rearranged," Isaacs said. "I try 
to let [the students) figure out cos-
tuming and how to stage the 
shows. 

"We do this every year and we 
go through the · same process, 
which is the undergraduate dance 
majors [each choreograph] a piece 
and it is their opportunity to show-
case their work in a real theater 
with real stage lights and a paying 
audience," Isaacs said. "The overall 
thi ng about the concert is it is their 
opportunity to show their work in a 
major venue." 

Show dates are May 28 and 
May 29 at 8 p.m. in Mandeville 
Auditorium.

If you're in the mood for a feel-good romantic comedy that numbs the brain with 
sugar-coated characters, con-
trived dialogue and elaborately 
urban settings that would never 
happen in the most fantastic life , 
"Raising Helen" is not for you. 
In the sudden tidal wave of 
romantic comedies and tween-
friendly films this spring, Kate 
Hudson's newest wannabe bloclc-
buster leaves the audience des-
perately searching for something 
more . 

We've come to expect more 
from director Garry Marshall, 
who garnered his title as master 
of romantic comedies with 
"Pretty Woman," "Runaway 
Bride" and "The Princess 
Diaries." But Marshall delivers a 
stale-humored film about Helen 
Harris (played by the efferves-

c.ry me: Kate Hudson and John 
Corbett star in director Garry MarshaJrs 
latest saccharine-5Oaked bore.

cent Kate Hudson), who is given 
custody over her sister's three 
children following the untimely 
death of their parents (Felicity 
Huffman and Sean O'Bryan). 

The catch is that Helen herself 
hasn't quite grown up yet. Wait -
Kate Hudson playing a character 
with a glamorous life, trying to be 
likeable with her slapstick humor? 
An attempt to pull off slapstick 
humor with bouncy blonde curls so 
that she can be more likeable? 
Andie Anderson of "How To Lose 
A Guy in ) 0 Days," anyone? 
Hudsons character is absorbed in 
her materialistic, glamorous life as a 
modeling agent who has the knack 
for discovering beautiful female tal-
ent and dating even more beautiful 
male talent. Helen finds herself 
having to change her entire life to 
accommodate the three new lives 
she is responsible for - starting 
with moving from her small 
Manhattan central apartment to a 
space- and rent-friendly home in 
less-than-glamorous Queens. 

Of course, no gray . cloud 
comes without a silver lining, 
and this time its in pastor Dan 
Parker (played by John Corbett, 
also no stranger to romantic 
comedy fame), who is in charge 
of the Lutheran school where 
Helen decides to place the kids. 
However, the romance is under-
played as Helen is understand-
ably weirded out about dating a 
pastor (when her previous date 
had been on the latest Armani 
billboard). The romance aspect 
of the film is appropriately 
underwritten because the film 
sells itself as focusing around the 
life of a woman who has to raise 
three children without having 
fully grown up herself, but the 
chemistry between Corbett and 
Hudson is flatter than a can of 
soda that's been sitting on the 
kitchen counter for over a week. 
Perhaps it is because the two

REVIEW 

incredibly talented actors keep 
playing the same stock characters 
instead of creating a character 
for this specific film. Parker is 
reminiscent of Corbett's roles in 
"My Big Fat Greek Wedding" 
and "Sex and the City," and if 
Hudson plays another goofy but 
gorgeous New Yorker, this 
reviewet will have to gouge her 
eyes out. It goes to show that not 
every attractive actress with an 
ounce of charm can fake it well 
enough for the silver screen. 

What is redeeming about 
"Raising Helen" is that the plot 
doesn't deviate too much from the 
story of the three children, who are 
accurately portrayed as angst-rid-
den and confused elementary, mid-
dle school and high school stu-
dents. Hayden Panettiere plays 
Audrey, a wild child following 
Helen's old fOOlSteps of partying 
late and dating reckless boys. 
Heruy (Spencer Breslin) and Sarah 
(Abigail Breslin) both play up the 
lost little kids aspect when Henry 
won't play basketball without his 
dad and Sarah won't tie her shoes 
without her mom. The interaction 
between Hudson and the children 
shows the chemistry in their 
makeshift family, and would make 
the film more worthwhile, if only it 
were less cold and manipulating.

THURSDAY, MAY 27,2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS II 

Why rock 'n' roll needs a little estrogen VOl Alta: Space features 
short kids • 
are cool Y 

Sarah Mak 

I was s1rimming through the April 7 issue of s.n Diego CityBtlll, and as I made my way to the CD 
reviews, something caught my 
attention: "Women suck as rock 
vocalists. " 

Hold on a second - women 
suck as rock vocalists? I think not 

Confused, I read and re-read the 
article and Ripped to the cover. Yes, 
much to my added confusion, it was 
a 2004 issue and nor something 
from, say, 1954. In his review, Troy 
Johnson went on to say that the 
only possible exceptions were 
Courmey Love, Janis Joplin and 
Mia Zapata. Yes, out of "" the 
female rockers in history, only three 
(and "possibly a few others") were 
worthy of not sucking. The basis of 
Mr. Johruon~ argument was that a 
women's violent and angry side 
(apparently a requisite for rockers) 
never have the opportunity to man-
ifest themselves in society and, 
hence, their music suffers. I expect-
ed a lot more from the arts and 
entertainment editor of CityBtllt. 
Alas, that was not the case; shame 
on you Troy Johnson for writing 
something so sexist and inaccurate. 
Dear, oh dear. Anyone with a 
decent, respectable knowledge in 
music would und~tand the gross 
inaccuracy of such a statement 

So get ready boys and girls, 
we're taking a quick trip down 
memory lane to show you t1l1t not 
only do women rock as vocalists, 
but they rock on every level, and 

that they can rock just as hard, or 
harder, than male rockers. 

In the '60s, we had Janis, the 
poster child of the Monterey 
International Pop Festival, who 
embraced the hippie world with her 
powerhouse screeches and crooning 
whilst belting out notes from some 
killer pipes. In the '70s, we had 
Chrissy Hynde of the Pretenders 
and Siouxsie Sioux, spawn of the 
revolutionaries of punk, the Sex 
Pistols. Sioux playa! in the same 
band as Sid 

" 

care that she swears like a sailor? 
No, and that's because she's a true 
rock star. 

All of the women mentioned 
above not only have the attitude 
that's needed to be a rock star, but 
they've made themselves icons of 
the rock world because they have 
voices that span octaves and the 
ability to sing one moment, then 
screech, moan and yell the next. 

To say that music history has 
only produced three decent female 

Vicious. Enough 
said. In the '80s, we 
had Debbie Harry, 
a pioneering bot-
tled blonde who 
could Irick Britney's 
ass any day; Kim 
Deal, who at the 
age of 43 proved 
she could sriJJ bat-
til: the scorching 
heat at Coachella 
this month; and 
Kim Gordon, the 
Sonic Youth rocker 
who could belt out 
a tune and play a

are just doing what 
women do best ... 

vocalists is like say-
ing that the new JC 
Chasez album is 
this year's must-
have album - it's a 
load of shit. 

lt is the gross 
inequalities that 
women have had 
to overcome in the 
past that have 
made us killer 
rockers. The 
oppression 
women have had 
to face only makes

mean bass like no other. The '9Os 
saw a flood of female musicians 
sweeping the airwaves: Ani 
DiFranco, the Breeders, Sleater-
Kinney, Blonde Redhead and PJ 
Harvey are a few of the hundreds 
who were rocking and rolling in the 
music industry. At the dawn of the 
2 J st century, radio stations are now 
bombarded with .bands led by my 
feUow sex. Current radio favorites, 
the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, feature front-
woman Karen 0, who rocks harder 
than most male rockers out there 
today. Known to douse herself in 
beer or champagne during shows, 
does she care that her tights have 
ladders running up them? Does she 

us stronger, emo-
tionally and men-

tally. Female rock vocalists bring a 
whole new light to rock music, 
proving that you don't need to be 
a guy to belt out a song and play 
the guitar hard and fast. As the 
supposed more emotional of the 
two sexes, women have an emo-
tional side that they are not afraid 
of hiding - perhaps, some may 
argue, less afraid than males. 
Unafraid of showing our emotions 
rather than bottling them up 
inside, we're ready to vocalize 
them in a song. 

Take Beth Gibbons from 
Portishead. Her voice is so haunting 
that you get shivers up your spine 
when you listen to her sing about 

her break up with her boyfriend. 
And when female rockers are pissed 
off, they'll make sure you know it, as 
the riot-grrri genre will gladly attest 
to. Love her or loathe her, 
Courtney Love is another example 
of a female rocker icon. Love has 
been blamed by some for a lot of 
stuff; from plotting to kill Kurt 
Cobain and child neglect, to assault 
and substance abuse. Whether or 
not she is guil ty of any of that is 
another matter, but it is her I-don't-
give-a-fuck attitude (minus the 
cocaine) that maIres her such a rock 
star. She'll gladly put all the media 
frenzy behind her and strike out a 
couple of songs. And female rockers 
need that attitude if they're going to 
face reviews such as the one in 
CitylJut and other false assump-
tions that society places on them. 

Female rockers have two prima-
ry jobs: one, to play good music in 
the mostly male-<iominated genre 
of roclc; and two, to battle these 
prejudices that society has toward 
them. Women no longer have to 
subscribe to the meek, stay-at-
home, well-mannered lifestyle soci-
ety expected of them, so why should 
they have to sing like that? Female 
rockers are just doing what women 
do best, being honest to themselves 
and expressing their emotions. 
They just do it with a Fender Strat 
and a leick-ass attitude. And it is for 
this reason that female rockers rock 
harder tha.1 male rockers: Women 
must face and overcome stereotypes 
and prejudices. 

They rock hard, they could 
probably drink most guys under the 
table, and man, oh man could they 
Irick Troy Johnson's ass. Clear the 
testosterone out of your ears Troy 
Johnson, because, as Karen 0 
would say, "boy, you're just a stupid 
bitch."

list of Scholar 

Athletes 
conlinued from page 16 

the team's total races in the 2004 
season and rowed in 75 percent of 
the varsity boat's races . 

Once Kleckner's eligibility was 
established, she was rated relative 
to every other eligible entry on 
her team's strength of schedule, 
the Tritons' regular-season 
record, the end of the season 
regatta results, her nomination 
rank, comments submitted by 
Pinkerton and on her 2,OOO-meter 
erg score . 

Eight All-Americans, one 
alternate and one cOJlSwain were 
selected by a committee of 
Regional Chairpersons on May 
17. 

The final list of All-Americans 
included rowers from eight 
schools across the country, includ-
ing two athletes each from 
Mercyhurst College in Erie , 
Penn., and Western Washington 
University. 

Out of a total list of 20, five 
Tritons were elected CRCA 
Division Il National Scholar 
Athletes, more than Humboldt 
State and Barry University in 
Miami Shores, Fla., which were 
close seconds with four rowers 
each selected for the honor. 

Criteria set by the CRCA for 
National Scholar Athletes include 
a 3.5 CPA through the fall of the 
current yea r, having at least 
sophomore statu , ha vi ng rowed 
in a minimum of 75 percent of her 
team's varsity races and having a 
coach in good standing in the

to placing in the top-five in both 
breaststroke events. In the UCSD 
record books, Bogard holds the 
second-best 200-yard individual 
medley time of 2:04.75, the sec-
ond-best IOO-yard breaststroke 
time of 1 :02.41 and the third-best 
200-yard breaststroke time at 
2:18.18. 

Bogard is also a winner of the 
NCAA Postgraduate Scholarship, 
which is given to athletes who 
have demonstrated academic and 
athletic superiority and who have 
been involved in community ser-
vice. 

"1 think Denise is what every 
UCSD student-athlete should 
aspire to be," McGihon said. "And 
I realize that's a pretty strong 
statement." 

The third swimmer to leave 
the women\; team has had a dif-
ferent experience than the aver-
age UCSD swimmer. Because of 

serious injury and illness, Hannah 
Foster was unable to swim for the 
greater part of three of her four 
years on the team. 

Foster was determined [Q stay 
involved and build a role for her-
self as a member of the team. She 
attended practices even when she 
could not train, helped the coach-
es on deck and came to every meet 
during her senior year to cheer. 

"It's so important for us to 
work as a unit, so when I couldn't 
actually do what everyone else was 
doing, I had to find new ways to 
contribute," Foster said. "It would 
have been really easy to just give 
up and walk away from it this year, 
but I felt like [ would have let the 
team down." 

While Foster supponcd the 
team, her teammates reciprocated 
throughout her illnesses.

Fellow first-time all-CCAA

Cyn City: Medals don't mean much to pros 
continued from page 16 

anything to prove because they've 
already made their mark in the pro 
ranks. 

Don't get me wrong, I love watch-
ing Mike Modano of the Dallas Stars 
use his speed and slick moves to 
undress twO defensemen and flick a 
wrist shot in the top shelf, or Jeremy 
Roenick of the Philadelphia Flyers 
malce an an out of checking his 
opponents into the third row of seats. 
But 1 already see aU of this during the 
NHL season. We all know how good 
they are, but itl; time to bring bade 
the old traditions of letting amateurs 
duke it out for the gold. Some can 
argue that the United StlItes is not 
really sending its best if it sends the 
amateurs, but who cares? I didn't 
hear about anyone complaining that 
the United States should ha~"C sent 
American NHL players instead of 
some toothless lcids from Boston 
University or University of 

Minnesotll to the 1980 Olympics. 
Who wants to watch a bunch of old 
millionaires play hockey anyway? 
The only thing that really matters to 
the professional players is the Stanley 
Cup. [ guarantee that aU the players 
on the gold-medal winning 
Canadian hockey team would hand 
over their medals in a heartbeat if it 
meant that their names would be 
etched into the Holy Grail. Even the 
greatest hockey player ever, Wayne 
Grettlcy, said it himself: "You 
know, I've held women and babies. 
I've held jewels and money. But 
nothing will ever feel as good as 
holding that cup." And this is a dude 
from a country that eats, lives and 
breathes hockey. Why not give col-
lege player.! a chance at the medal 
again? Who wouldn't want another 
American hoclcey hero like Mike 
E:.nWone? 
Just loolc at what poor sports the 
American hockey players were in the 

1998 Olympics in Nagano, Japan. 
After losing in the early rounds, they 
ouned into rock starS and trashed 
their hotel rooms, destroying chairs 
and their digni ty in the process. 1 
question their willingness to play. 
Even in baslcetball, after the disas-
trOus 2002 World Championships, 
the NBA stars don't seem to care 
about redeeming themselves. 
Some professional players just flat-
out refuse to play. Kevin Garnett of 
the T1mberwolves declined to play 
this summer, and he is this yeark 
Most Valuable Player. The Lalcers' 
Kobe Bryant withdrew his invitation 
because of a "scheduling conflict." 
Since when did anyone reject a 
chance at a gold medal because of a 
scheduling conflict? So, why not give 
some amateurs a chance again? We 
may not always win and we may not 
always be the favorites, but only as 
underdogs do we have the chance to 
achieve another miracle.

was always a pick-me-up to be with 
my teammates," Foster said. "My 
time here was less about the actual 
swimming - although I do love the 
spon - and more about the people 
I was with." 

Foster is majoring in interdisci-
plinary computing and the arts and 
will graduate halfway through the 
2004-05 academic school year. 

On the men's side, a veteran and 
a newcomer who were both key to 
the men's success this year are leav-
ing the team. Captain Rob Small 
has been a collegiate swimmer for 
four years and has helped make 
UCSD a breaststroke powerhouse, 
while John Pearce, a transfer stu-
dent, was only on the team for 
three months, but greatly improved 
UCSD's showing in the distance 
freestyle events . 

Small earned second place in 
both breaststroke events at the 
NCAA Championships this season. 
He holds the second-best time in 
UCSD history in the 200-yard 
breaststroke with a time of 2:03.56, 
and the third-best time in the 100-
yard breaststroke at 56.53. 

His new leader.!hip position this 
year inspired Small to wotk harder 
and realize his full potential. 

"When I was elected captain, it 
put pressure on me because I felt 
more accountable for the team," 
Small said. "Not only did [ want to 
do well in my last season, but I also 
felt that other people might be 
looking to me to go fast. " 

Small credits younger swimmers 
with pushing him to give his best 

effort in training. According to 
McGihon, however, the motivation 
worked both ways. 

"[Small) turned out to be a 
tremendous leader for the team, 
both in action and in word," 
McGihon said. "He helped mentor 
the freshmen athletes." 

Small will earn his psychology 
degree nen fall . 

Pearce, a political science 
major, transferred to UCSD from 
Grossmont College in San Diego 
last fall. After playing water polo 
and swimming at Grossmont, 
Pearce decided to use his last 
quarter of eligibility to compete in 
the second half of the season at 
UCSD. 

"I would like to thanlc my UCSD 
coaches for taking a chance on me 
and giving me the opponunity to be 

a pan of the 2004 Tritons," Pearce 
said. 

The coaches' gamble paid off 
when Pearce placed eighth in three 
events at the NCAA 
Championships. His time in the 
I,OOO-yard freestyle, 9:30.16, made 
the record books as the second-
fastest in UCSD history, and his 
time in the 2oo-yard freestyle, 
1:41.74, was sixth fastest in the 
UCSD books. 

When asked what they would 
miss most, each senior said that they 
would miss being a part of a group 
of friends that was so dose it was 
almost like a family. 

"It's an awesome feeling to know 
that 50 other people share in your 
goals and dreams and are there to 
back you up no matter what," Foster 
said.

Bring back 
unknown 

and toothless 
athletes 

Cynthia Blade Chavez 

A couPle of days ago, I watched \:he movie "Miracle" for the econd time. Unfortunately, I 
wa n't even close to being born when 
a group of young, unknown college 
hockey players pulled off the huge 
upset against a powerful and domi-
nant Soviet team in the 1980 Winter 

Iympics. On May 20, USA Hockey 
released a list of player selected to 
represent the United States in the 
World Cup of Hockey in September. 
All 26 American players are NHL 
superstars, and 19 of them are over 
30 years old. 

Watching "Miracle" got me think-
mg. Why not bring back amateurs in 
world and Olympic ports? I n't that 
what it was all about in the first 
place? It's supposed to be about send-
mg the be t athlete to represent 
each nation, but, I don't think it

al players. They don't really have

Five SWil1l111erS take their last dives at UCSD 
Tritons lose school record holders Kwok and Small 

By EVA HOFFMAN 
Senior Staff lMiter 

After a triumphant 2004 season, 
the UCSD swim team bid farewell 
to five athletes who contributed 
their dedication and leadership to 
making the Tritons faster and more 
successful . 

Carolyn Kwok, who will gradu-
ate with a degree in management 
science, earned the NCAA title of 
Academic All-American this sea-
son. Successfully juggling the 
demands of school, work and train-
ing, Kwok won the team's academ-
ic award for the highest GPA in her 
class four years in a row. 

Kwok finished her swimming 
career as a UCSD champion and 
national record holder in the 200-
yard freestyle relay. According to 
Kwok, being a part of that unde-
feated relay was one of her most 
valued experiences on the team. 

Kwok is one of the best sprint-
ers in UCSD history, holding the 
fi fth position on the team' al l-time 
top-10 list in the 50-yard freestyle

T he Collegiate Rowing 
Coaches Association named six 
members of the Triton women's 
rowing program as recipients of 
national postseason awards. In 
the May 24 announcement, 
senior Alexis Kleckner was 
named a Division II AlI-
American, while senior Elizabeth 
Jones, junior Joyce Chang and 
sophomores Cara Kuebert, 
Arianna Pilram and Lauren Ruiz 
were honored as CRCA Scholar 
Athletes for 2004. 

Kleckner, a native of Rialto, 
Calif., was one of 10 women 
across the country selected for 
the Al l-American ti tl e after pass-
ing intense criterion to verify 
that she is one of this season 's 
best athletes in the sport. 

Head coach Patti e Pinkerton 
nominated Kleckner as one of a 
maximum of fou r athletes from 
the UCSD team who would be 
eligible for the award . 

T he requirements for being 
considered for All -American sta -
tus are divided between an ath-
lete's dedication to rowing and 
the impression of that athlete in 
the eyes of her team and the 
insti tution for which she rows. 

Kleckner had to be eligible 
for the honor by UCSD stan-
dards, then nominated by the 
universi ty. She was required to

To top off a strong season, five 
members of the UCSD softball 
team received All-California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
honors. Seniors Kim Aggabao and 
Amy Mettee and junior Breanne 
Cope were selected to first team, 
and junior Jamie Hurst and sopho-
more Desiree Franciscus both 
made second team. 

Aggabao, a co-captain who 
played shortstop and second base-
man, was selected as the CCAA's 
Most Valuable Player of the year, 
the first time a Triton has ever 
received this honor for softball. 

Aggabao led the league with a 
.411 batting average, and fell just 
short of the all-time school record 
of .41 S, set by Erin Bridges in 
2000. Aggabao led the league in 
doubles with 23, also setting a 
school record. Playing in all S6 of 
the team's games this season, 
Aggabao led UCSD with 38 RBIs, 
her second consecutive year knock-
ing in the most runs. 

Aggabao also touched more 
bases than any other Triton, at 
104, finished the season with a 
slugging percentage of .638, and 
scored 32 runs. She blasted all four 
of her collegiate home runs this 
year and also played solid defense, 
turning in a .948 fielding percent-
age. 

In addition to her CCAA MVP 
honor, Aggabao earned' first-team 
honors for the third consecutive 
year and will leave UCSD in the 

top-six in each of the six cate-
gories of all-time UCSD softball 
records. 

Joining Aggabao in· first-team 
honors is fellow co-captain 
Mettee. Mettee will be leaving 
quite a legacy behind at UCSD, 
exiting with the lead in five 
records categories, as well as two 
second-place spots. She ended the 
year batting .309 and led the team 
with two triples, 45 runs ana 22 
stolen bases. Mettee's all-time 
first-place stats include 256 hits, 
48 doubles, 18 home runs, 162 
runs and 544 assists. She will grad-
uate from UCSD as the all-time 
second-best in both triples and 
stolen bases, with 16 and 70, 
respectively. This is Mettee's 
fourth selection to the all-CCAA 
team, earning second-team honors 
her freshman year and earning a 
spot on the first team for the next 
three years. 

Left fielder Cope rounded out 
UCSD's representation on the 
first team, marlcing her first all-
CCAA appearance of her career. 
Cope's .313 batting average was 
third on the team, and she led 
UCSD with five home runs for the 
season. She had 19 RBIs and 27 
runs, while knoclcing out 11 dou-
bles. Her .507 slugging percentage 
was the second highest on the 
team. 

Catcher and first baseman 
Hurst made it onto the all-CCAA 
second team, after receiving an 
honorable mention last year.
