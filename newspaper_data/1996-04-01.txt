UCLA Favors Top Officials, Donors 
ADMISSIONS: 
School repeatedly gave 
preference to elite 
By Terry Lew 
Associate News Editor 

The University of California pref-
erential admissions "scandal" deep-
enedon March 26 when the LosAnge-
les Times reported that slate elected 
officials have made hundreds o'f UC 
admissions requests over the last de-
cade through the university 'S Sacra-
mento lobbying office. 

The Times first reported on March 
16 that several UC regents and top 
state officials had used their influence 
to get relatives, friend and children 
of business partners admitted to UCLA 
- sometimes in lieu of better quali-
fied applicants who were turned away. 

According to the Times, more than 
80 past and present public officials 
made hundreds of requests over the 
last 15 years, either directly to UCLA 
administrators or through UC lobby-
ist Stephen Arditti in Sacramento. 

UC Regent Ralph Carmona told 
the Times that admissions requests by

anyone with clout, such as legislators 
or school principals, carry special 
weight. 

"People who come from disad-
vantaged backgrounds, who are black 
and Latinos, didn't have thai kind of 
weight to carry," Carmona told the 
Times. 

Regent Leo Kolligian made the 
most requests of any regent, accord-
ing to the Times investigation. 
Kolligian made 32 requests, the most 
recent coming in 1990 for the son of a 
longtime friend and bu ine partner. 

Other regents and officials who 

made special requests included Re-
gent Meredith Khachigian, who suc-
ceeded in reversing her daughter's 
rejection from UCLA; Regent Frank 
Clark, a former bank director who 
intervened on behalf of the son of a 
bank vice president; Board of Re-
gents Chair Clair Burgener, whose 
lellerofrecommendation fora friend's 
daughter won her admission to UCLA 
as a ophomore; and Regent Bill

get the sister of a top state GOP legis-

Racist Graffiti 
MarsUCSD 
Parking Lot 
RETAUAnON?: Union 
claims graffiti is related to 
grievance hearing 
By Terry Lew 
Associate News Editor 

The University Professional Technical 
Employees (UPTE) union called a press con-
ference March 22 to denounce racist epithets 
which had been scrawled on a curb in the 
Clinical Sciences Building parking lot on 
March 20. 

Lab Assistant Brenda Sanders was the first 
person to discover the graffi ti , which included 
swastikas and slogans such as "Hail Hillier" 
[sic 1, "White Power, ""Fuck Niggers," "KKK" 
and "Kill All Niggers." 

"When I came in the morning, it wasn' t 
there," Sanders said. "When I left at 4: 10 
[p.m.], it was. I've never seen any graffiti as 
long as I've been working here, and it 's been 
over 20 years." 

Hate crIme: UCSD Lab Assistant Brenda Sanders shows reporters the curb where, on 
March 20, she discovered racist slurs written in crabapple juice. 

Sanders said she discussed the Incident 
with a friend and then decided to call the police 
the next morning. 

I UCSD Staff-Stung by New Jersey C~nvicts 
In Seven-Year Telephone-Billing Scam 

"When I came out, ISanders 1 was talking to 
the policemen," Lab Assistant Evelyn Grant 
said. "When I walked over, I saw pretty much 
the same thing. I didn't go any further becaut: 
I was afraid to see what was down there." 

Grant added that he felt targeted because 
she and everal other African-American em-
ployees consi tenlly park in the same area and 
work certain hours. WARNING: Prison officials' 

efforts to end the scam have 
been unsuccessful 
By Anand Patel 
Staff Writer 

During recent years, a few ingenious convicts 
locked up in the New Jersey state pri on system 
have been "reaching out and touching" more people 
than prison officials would like. 

A community-alert bulletin forwarded by UC 
Berkeley Police on Wed., March 7 stated that for 
the past seven years, people at several UC cam-
puse , including UCSD, have been victimized by 
long-distance telephone scams originating from a 
New Jersey correctional facility . 

In the scam, the caller identifies himself as a 
law-enforcement official from New Jersey and 
attempts to convince the victim to accept collect-

call charges from the operator by claiming it is a 
"police emergency." 

According to UC Berkeley Police Captain Bill 
Foley, after the victim accepts the collect charges, 
the perpetrator then requests to be transferred by 
the victim to a 1-800 number. This number is 
typically a long-distance company's automated 
service for billing to a third party, much like 1-
8oo-COLLECT or I 800-CALLATT. 

From this 800 number, the caller can make 
long-distance calls charged to the victim's ac-
count because the carrier bills only the number 
which initiated the transfer. 

"The number [the phone company's computerj 
sees is the number which transferred the call," 
Foley aid, "so the saspect has paid nothing and is 
in the long-distance system." 

Foley described another scam in which a caller 
uses a victim' voice mail to subsequently gain 

See HOAX, Page 3 

"If they had put it anywhere el e, 1 could 
say it was a random act," she said. "But to put 
it right where we park every day, where we 
would see it, that's aying something." 

UPTE President Jelger Kalmijn claimed 
the graffiti was related to a hearing in which 
several Office of Animal Resources (OAR) 
employees accused the department's manage-
ment of racism and retaliation. 

"While at this time we do not know who 
perpetrated this act, it is highly [suspect] that 
the day we are in' trial with the management of 
this department, these racist slogans get painted 
around [the employee' carsj," Kalmijn said. 

"We' re not saying that they did it; wedon't 
know who did it - but on the other hand, 
where it was on the curb is where these people 
always park. We don' t think that thi i a

RELIGIOUS 
PREFERENCE 

SLIGHTS OTHERS 
istorically, America has been known for 
its acceptance of all religions. And while 
this .lation's law~ allow the open pracÂ· 
tice of all kinds of religions, they also 
prevent the government from outwardly 
supporting anyone of them. However, 

this policy ha~ virtually never been enforced 
~i nce the law~ of thiS land were written over 200 year~ 
ago. Christianity was and continues to be the U.S. 
govcrnmcnt 's unofficial rcligion of choicc. 

In particular, we see thc government's preference 
for Christianity in it's efforts to keep the Mount 
Soledad cross from being rcmoved. The cross, which 
was dedicated to the ci ty on Easter Sunday, 1954, by 
the Mount Soledad Mcmorial Association, was in -
tended as a memorial to war veterans. But it has since 
lost thi !'. meaning and become a completely Christi an 
monument: offending non- hnslians and excluding 
non-Christian war veterans alike. 

The deba te over the Mount Soledad cross has 
brought to the foreground a number of constitutional 
issues. In 1991 , the court ordered the Ci ty of San Di-
ego to remove the cross because the monument vio-
lated the Privilege Clause (If the alifornia tate Con-
stitution, which states the "free exercise and enjoy-
ment 01 religIOn without discnminatlOn or preferem:e 
I isl guaranteed." 

The ci ty, however, failed to ri ght its wrongs by 
erecting a new, non-offensive monument. After Ihe 
U.S. Court 01 Appcal~ alfJrllled the onglnal court dcÂ· 
cision lO have the cross removed, and the U.S. Su-
preme Court refused to hear the case, Ihe cit y so ld 61T 
the ~ mall plot or land directly under Ihe cross to the 
Mount Soledad Memorial ASSOCiation . The 222 
square- fopt plot was sold wi/h out open bidding, thus 
evading the court 's order. 

That the cit y government accepts the cross being 
on publi ~ land is, in itself, a form or religious prefer-
ence. Be~ause the cross is clearly a Chri stian symbol , 
other religions are effectively di scouraged from hold-

CONTROVERSY 
AS EASTERAPPROACHES, CHRISTIANS 
AND ATHEISTS CONTEND OVER THE 
CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE CROSS 

OVERLOOKI,NG SAN DIEGO 

ATHEIST SERVICE IS A PETTY 'EGO TRIP' FOR IRONS 
very Easter Sunday since the 
early I 920s, Christians in San 
Diego have had the special op-
portunity to celebrate the resur-
ection of Jesus Christ atop 

Mount Soledad. In an Intimate 
sunnse service beneath the towerin~ con-
cretc cros , they have prayed, sung and 
given thanks to God for their salva tion 
without intcrruption. One cannot overesÂ· 
timate the significance of thiS Easter cel-
ebration to San Diego Christian popula-
tioll. For as anyone who has visi ted Mount 
Soledad can tell you, the view of the city, 
t he ocean and the surrounding mountains 

is breathtaking. 
Christians on this upcoming Easter, 

however, will find themselves bereft of the 
chance to express their faith on thi holy 
day. No, Easter has not been cancelled, nor 
has their right to worship been curtailed. 
The tragedy of Easter 1996 is that wor-
shippers of the god of politics have sub-
verted the traditional Christian celebration 
on Mount Soledad. Despite the signifi-
canre of this Â·Iong-standing celebration, a 
horde of spoilsports intend to prove they 
also have the right to worship around the 
famed cross on Easter morning.

litical science and a Harvard-trained law-
yer, leads these killjoys. Irons has been 
challenging the Mount Soledad Cross since 
1990, alleging that iLS placemcnt on pub-
lic land is a violation of the U.S. ConstituÂ· 
tion. This last February, Irons figured he 
would fan the flames of controversy a lillie 
more by applying for a permit lO use the 
Mount Soledad park on Easter moming. 
Because Irons was "first" in line during 
the first -come, lirst-served permit appli -
cation process, a permit to use the park wa~ 
granted to him with no objections from the 
San Diego City Attorney's office.

COMMENTARY: Although mudslinging has long been a staple of American elections, politicians and their 
cronies have developed new strategies to defame their opponents 

PLAYING DIRTY IN THE POLITICAL ARENA 
By Christi_ Baine 
Staff Writer 

Mudslinging is as American as 
apple pie and b~eball. That's not 
to say that it doesn' t go on in other 
countries as well, where govern-
ment officia ls oftcn rely on the 
whim ical and changeable nature of 
the electorate for their jobs. How-
ever, politicians in thi s country have 
taken mudslinging to an all-time 
high - or low, depending on how 
cynical you are. There are now even 
politically correct terms for mud-
slinging, such a~ "negative search." 

That candidates must expose 
their opponent 's adolescent short-
comings I, ludlcrou, . For in tance, 
aCl:using an opponent or inhaling il -
licit drugs is nothing more than a 
revelation or youthful exuberance 
and experimentation. uch an accu-
sation docs not reveal how compe' 
lent the candwate would be in of-
fice. A candidate should not be 
o,triclzed from the election due to 
accusations which are blown out of 
proportion. 

Mudslinging has gone hand-inÂ· 
hand With American poh tics since 
the country's inception, dating back 
a, far as the days of George Wash-
ington. Gov. George Cli nton. who 
\\ a, hrlefly co nSidered as 
Washlngllln 's runnlllg mate, was 

labeled a "sure loser" who couldn 't 
pick up any votes . Andrew 
Jackson 's bid for the presidency in 
the election of 1828 was met with 
accusations that his wife, Rachel, 
was a bigamist, and that he, there-
fore , was an adulterer. Jackson won 
anyway, but it seems the slress was 
too great for Rachel, who died just 
a few weeks after the eleclion. 

Besides using mudslinging to 
make themselves appear less mor-
ally corrupt than their opponent, 
candidates often use it (0 avoid 
weak points in their platforms. It 
makes sense that a Republi can 
would criti cize hi s Democratic 
opponent 's views on taxation In or-
der to draw allention away from his 
unpopular views on abortion. 

Sometimes, mudslinging IS the 
only way a candidate can usurp the 
scat of an almost unassailable in-
cumbent. Political newcomers can 
promote their stances on volatile 
issues, such as the ''Three Strikes" 
law or capital punishment, by ma-
nipul ating statistics to show the in- . 
effectiveness of the incumbent's 
methods. This type of "negative 
search" doesn 't appear all that dis-
reputable. It appcars to be a legiti-
mate campaign strategy to bring out 
an opponent 's past polilical mis-
take or shortcomings. However,

even find the remote between the 
couch cushiolls, some greasy poli -
tician has already invaded your liv-
ing room and completely demol-
ished the moral character of his op-
ponent, 

Just before last Christmas, GOP 
hopeful Lamar Alexander decided 
that enough was enough. He aired a 
new televi sion commercial con-
demning the juvenile antics of Sena-
tor Phil Gramm and Malco lm 
"Steve" Forbes , Jr. Al exa nder 
scoffed at the pairs ongoing televi -
sion debate over Gramm's record on 
laxes, saying that hi s two opponents 
more closely resembled candidatt;s 
runOing for president of the fifth 
grade , instead of the country. Of 
course, Alexander 's commerCial 
amounted to little more than mud-
slinging, but we ' ll just ignore that 
right now. 

Another increasingly popular 
method of negative campaigning is 
found in the mailbox. Mail propa-
ganda has long been a means of 
fu ndraising. Today, however, Ihe 
U.S. Postal Servl 'e unwitlingly acts 
a an agent or mudslinging. Leaf-
lets and newsletters di sparagi ng a 
certain candidate are disguised as 
pen IOn checks and subpoenas to 

ensure they are opened. The mail is 
effective because letters and pam-
phlets can be directed to the most 
recepti ve audience, based on politi -
cal demographics. Though this type 
of mudslinging does not appear to 
be very widespread, Larry Sabato, 
author of several books on modern 
campaign techniques, terms it "the 
silent killer." 

The newest mode of mudsling-
ing scurries along the phone lines. 
The "push poll" is a survey used to 
find the vulnerabilities of opposi ng 
candidates. In the 1992 New Hamp-
shire Republican primary, George 
Bush campaigners ca lled hundreds 
of women in the area and read them 
Pat Buchanan 's remark questioning 
the fitness of women to have ca-
reers. Afterwards, the campaigners 
asked the women if they were now 
more or less likely to vote for 
Buchanan. eedless to say, the ma-
jority of women answered with a 
resounding "no." 

Today, a mutation of the ori gi-
nal "pu h poll" is occurring within 
the last 48 to 72 hours of,a poli tica l 
race. " uppresslOn" ph<ine banks

sage to adherents that they are in-
siders. favored memben of a politi-
cal community." Again, the cross on 
Mount Soledad is an endorsement 
of religion by the government .. 
therefore making the monument 
unconstitutional. 

A war memorial does not need 
to utilize the symbols of any par-
ticular religion to honor veterans. 
They can be honored by the ser-
vice th~y have given. not by the 
religious beliefs they espouse. It 
is a mistake for San Diego to con-
tinue to offend the many veterans 
who are not Christian by denying 
the legitimacy of their beliefs. If 
the cross was intended to honor 
war veterans. it has failed its pur-
pose and should be replaced by a 
more filling memorial. 

The city has shown more inter-

vice in the park. We must remember 
that the First Amendment also pro-
hibits the government from restrict-
ing the free exercise of religion. Dc-
nying a permit to an organization 
which wanted to hold a religious ser-
vice would also appear to violate the 
First Amendmenl. 

But we've now run into a para-
dox within the Constitution; how can 
it be resol ved without simply Hipping 
a coin? There are many reasons to 
give the permit to the Mount Soledad 
Memorial Association rather than to 
the atheists. Fin!, Easter is obviously 
significant 10 Christians, but doesn't 
hold any particular significance for 
atheists. 

Second. a 73-year-old tradition ex-
ists between the Christians. Easter and 
Mount Soledad. Some might scoff at 
the notion of tradition. but keep in 
mind that tradition and precedent play 
a very important role in our society. 
especially in politics and law. 

Third. the Christians are simply 
asking to reserve the park for two 
boon out of the entire year. The athe-
iSIS could obtain a permit for the Sat-
urtIay before Easter or for later in the 

totalitarians one more reason to ridi-
cule democracy. Maybe it's our fault 
for bei ng so gull ible and uni n-
formed. The public must put an end 
to such underhandet:l tactics. Refus-
ing to vote for those candidates who 
utilize it as a campaign strategy 
would do the trick - but this is a 
seemingly impossible feat because 
almost every candidate engages in

further demonstrating the religious 
favoritism granted to Christians. 
Not only is it unconstitutional un-
der both the state and federal law to 
have the cross on public land. but 
the city has manipulated the order 
to preserve a public park surround-
ing a huge religious symbol. 

A government that favors one 
religion, whether overtly or co-
vertly. is a danger to a democratic 
society. Preserving a religious sym-
bol near public lands through favor-
itism and closed-door bargaining is 
a gross injustice to the people of San 
Diego. The cross on Mount Soledad 
should be removed to demonstrate 
that the illicit relationship between 
American government and Chris-
tianity has been dissolved. 

day. 
Finally. no one is forced to attend 

the Mount Soledad service. Even if 
someone does not wish to attend. he 
is not forced to sing. pray. sign a con-
fession of faith or otherwise commit 
to a matter of conscience. All he is 
required to do is shoW"COUrtesy and 
respect for the proc,eedings. 

Given these reasons,iron 's asser-
tion that â€¢ 'r atheists] have as much right 
to use parks on Easter as any other 
group" is laughable at the least and 
pathetic at the worst. 

Inevitably within a democracy, the 
rights of some individuals will con-
flict with the rights of others. Such a 
situation does not indicate that we 
cannot and should not make decisions 
about whose rights are to prevail in 
certain maners - having to make 
such decisions is one of the responsi-
bilities of government. By denying 
that government has the authority to 
make these dei:isions. Irons would 
foist his own liberal beliefs on us. It 
is this kind of coercion that the First 
Amendment, which Irons uses to de-
fend his position. was intended to pre-
vent. 

a little mUdslinging. 
Some other type of compaining 

needs to be erected in place of mud-
slinging. This new foru m must limit 
the candidates to addressing only 
their positions on issues. without 
mention of their opponents. This 
may sound idealistic and naive. but 
after 200 years ofthis crap, it 's time 
for a little political purification .

UCLA: Officials 
defend gi ving favors 
to major donors 
Continued from page 1 
ate school. 
Money talks 

The TimLS reported on March 21 
that UCLA ChancellorCharles Young 
and his aides also gave admissions 
priority to friends and relatives of 
major donors to the universily. inÂ· 
c1uding several prominent Los Ange. 
les figures. 

Although UCLA officials deÂ· 
fended the practice as another fund-
raising tactic, the Times investigation 
showed that since 1980, 900 indio 
vidual donors made more than 21,000 
requests on behalf of applicants to the 
university's undergraduate, graduate, 
housing and University Elememary 
School programs. 

Although Young defended the 
practice of giving "special considerÂ· 
ation" to the admissions requests of 
contributors. he said the university 
would not lower its standards in any 
case. 

"Should [major donors'] children 
be admitted if Lhey are not admisÂ· 
sible?" Young told the Times. 'The 
answer is Â·no. '" 

However. the Times investigation 
revealed that Young intervened in the 
admissions process at least twice -
once on behalf of the nephew of Saudi 
Arabia's wealthy former oil minister 
and once on behalf of his neighbor's 
son. Although neither of the students 
met UCLA 's admissions criteria, both 
were admitted. 
Political clout 

State eleeted officials have made 
hundreds of special requests 
systemwide in the last 10 years. the 
Times reported March 26.

random act of racial insult. we think 
this is a directed act by some very sick 
individuals." he added. 

However, Assistant Vice Chan-
cellor of Human Resources Rogers 
Davis said that it was a mistake to 
connect the two events, 

"It would not be sound judgment 
to speculate that this has anything to 
do with litigation regarding work 
ru les," Davis said. 

A point of contention discussed at 
the ~earing was OAR's attendance 
policy, which requires employees to 
give 24-hour advance notice before 
calling in sick. Otherwise, the ab-
sence is recordet1 as unexcused. 

UCSD PoIiceDetectiveNate Aoyd 
said that the police have not identified 
any suspects and that the investiga-
tion is ongoing. 

UCSD Interim Chancellor 
Mlljorie Caserio said that the admin-
istration considers the graffiti unac-
ceptable, and lent her full support to 
the investigation . 

"We are ... responsible for creatÂ· 
ing a welcoming campus environÂ· 
ment free from prejudice for all 
members of our diverse campus 
community." she said. "Acts of hate. 
violence or harassment will not be 
tolerated on this campus."

UCLA: Several 
legislators call for 
formal inquiries 
ContInued from pace 8 
tions. Former Speaker of the AssemÂ· 
bly Willie Brown. former Lt. .Gov. 
Leo McCarthy and Sacramento lobÂ· 
byist Ralph Ochoa made the most 
reque ts. according to records proÂ· 
duced by Arditli's office. Ochoa is 
currently under consideration to fill 
one of two vacancies on the UC BoarJ 
of Regents .. 

Although Arditti did not return 
seveml phone calls, he told the Times 
that the majority of the legislators' 
special requests were denied, 

"Sometime, they have an interest 
in their person and hope somehow 
that the person Will be treated favor-
ably , but yuu know we wind updeliv-
ering probably more bad new than 
gooJ m;w~aboutthesethlng~." Arditti 
told the Times. 
Now what? 

Two days after the original Times 
story appeared, UC President Richard 
Atkinson sent a leuer to the regents 
announcing that he had ordered UC 
Provost C. Judson King to conduct a 
review of UC admissions policies to 
determine the impact of special interÂ· 
ests on the process. 

"I also want to make clear that the 
university has no policy that affords 
preference to students as a result of 
letters or other communications on 
theirbehalfby prominent individuals, 
nor do we endorse such practices." 
Atkinson stated in the letter. 

Atkinson added that King's report 
wi II be completed by May 20, and that 
he will review the findings with the 
regents, the chancellors and the aca-
demiC council 

Interim Chancellor Marjori e 
Caserio said that UCSD considers 
every lelter of recommendation and 
inquiry it receive" and all are given 
equal weight.

Caserio added that she has asked 
the vice chancellors torevicw UCSD's 
admissions policies "to en ure that 
safeguards are m place to protect us . 
from external pressures and influences 
from prominent mdividuals." 

Several legislators. includingstah: 
enator Tom Hayden. D-Lo~ AngeÂ· 

les. and Assemblywoman Margueri te 
Archie-Hudson, DÂ·Los Angeles, ha vc 
also called for investigations into the 
matter. 

"What is scandalous here is that 
some officials regularly use their po-
sitions to improperly influence ad-
mission decisions." ArchieÂ·Hudson 
said. 'This raises troubling questions 
about the fairness of the uni versity 
admissions practices and the integrity 
of the university's governing board." 

Hayden. chair of the Senate Select 
Committee on Higher Education. an-
nounced Mareh 21 that his committee 
would hold a public hearing on April 
22 regarding the "growing evidence 
of a hidden subculture of favoritism" 
in UC admissions 

Hayden also called for regents, 
legi lators and university administra-
tors to adopt a code of ethics which 
would prohibit officeholders from 
using their positions to influence the 
uOlvcrsit} In ll1a ttcr~ or admission~ 
and hou~ing , as well a~ require that 
an) uni\ cr~ll y official receiving such 
a communication disclo 'e it immedi -
ately. 

Additionally, As~elllblYlllan 
Bernie RIChter, R-Chico, said March 

NEWS 9 

20 that he plans to amend the state 
budgetto include a prohibition against 
admissions tied to political influence 
or wealth. Richter is chair of the as-
sembly subcommittee which control 
UC finances, 

"The press accounts point to a 
rogue UC bureaucracy conniving 
with high government official to 
grant admissions to appl icants based 
on the content of their connections 
or the weight of their wallet." Rich-
ter said. 

According to Student Regent Des-
ignate Jess Bravi n, legislati ve inquir-
ies are an appropriate way of dealing 
with the controversy. 

'The public needs to know that 
this is their university. not the private 
plaything of a few well-placed indio 
vlduals." BrJvin said. "What we see 
across the board is an erosion of UC' s 
public character and an aduption of 
techniquc~ that may be appropriate 
for a private university. but really are 
contrary to what we should be all 
about."

UC REGENTS ARE Two-FACED POLITICIANS 
1WItGr: 

It is a BJUSS hypocrisy thal the UC

I would like to clear up some flC-
tual errors in a recent Gl/QrrJian edi-
torial ("'Visual Services' $5,700 
Loss lust Another UCSD Statistic," 
March 7, 1996). The Community 
Service Officers (CSOs) - not 
Campus Security Officers - are 
students who provide daytime park-
ing-lot patrol. They do not write ci-
tations during daYlime hours. Their 
job is to deter potential thieve and 
to observe and report illegal acti v-
ity. During evening hours, they write 
parking citations; but thaI is not their 

priority. They III"C not just Â·'a bunch 
of students on bikes patroIlilll park-
iDa lots for parting vioilliODs" and 
they are not '1Ianding out a dozen 
parting tickets per hour in every 
parking 101 on campus." 

In the Feb, S edition of the Guard-
ian, you ran an excellent cover story 
011 the cso Program based upon facts. 
We appreciated it because we work 
Iwd to provide a valuable service to 
the campus and try to make the cam-
pus safe. We ask that the G,JtlrrJian 
check its facts so misinfomldtion is not 
given to our community.

14 OPINION The UCSD Guardian ~o~y, April I, 1996 

BACKER HEADS DIFFERENT PROGRAM THAN THAT STATED BY ARTICLE 
Editor: 

Referring to Suketu Vaishnav's 
article "UCSD Reacts 10 
Connerly's Outreach, Financial 
Aid Stance" (March 14, 1996), in 
which you report UCSD's commu-
nity reaction to UC Regent Ward 
Connerly's attempt to include out-
reach programs as pan of the Re-
gents' Resolution to Abolish Af-
firmative Action. Please note the 
following ; The director of Early 
Academic Outreach Program 
(EAOP) at UCSD is Eustacio 
"Chato" Benitez, not Richard 
Backer, as your article reports. 

I think it is imponant to make a 
di stinction between outreach ser-

vices as they relate to recruitment, 
which Backer directs, and EAOP, 
which I have directed for the last 
20 years. Backer directs an outreach 
program related to recruitment , 
which has not been targeted by 
Connerly. EAOP, on the other hand, 
was Connerly' s latest target. 

In this respect, it is important to 
note thaI Connerly initially ex-
pressed a willingness to support 
programs like EAOP SD that 
underrepresented students could be -
academically prepared at the end of 
their high school years, Lhus mak-
ing it unnecessary to award points 
for an applicant's ethnicity. 

In fact, Connerly even offered to

Editor: 
There is a bright side to 

California's rejection of the three 

legaJ-refonn initiatives - Proposi-
tions 200, 201 and 202. If imple-
mented, these reforms would have 
required a massive government re-
training program to convert thou-
sands of bright, articulate ambu-
lance chasers into producti ve mem-
bers of society. These lawyers 
would then have to meet the new 
labor-market demand from corpo-
raLions relocating their businesses 
to California. 

We wouldn't want that to happen. 
Thank goodness we can instead 

look forward LO a further exodus of 
our evil California corporations and 
their jobs. I feel safer already.

By Seen Rahlml 
Associate Sports Editor 

The spring holiday turned out to 
be a disappointing hiatus for the 
UCSD baseball team, as it lost two 

of three home games. 
Going into the break, 
the Tritons had im-
proved their record to 
5-9-1, looking to get 
closer to the .500 
mark. 

The hardballers , 
however, lost a close 

game to the second-ranked 
Kingsmen from Cal Lutheran early 
la t week, and last aturday they 
blew the second game of a double-
header to the Rams of Cornell Col-

Junior right-handed hurler 

David Mullin notched his first col-
legiate victory with a complete-
game shutout in the opener on Sat-
urday. He limited Cornell College 
to four singles. while striking out 
two and walking just one during 
the scheduled even innings. BOIh 
games were concluded after seven 
innings at the request of the visit-
ing Rams. 

UCSD cruised to an early 4-1 
lead in the nightcap on the strength 
of four runs in the bottom of the first 
inning. After the Rams scored an 
initial run during the top of the first , 
freshman starter David Takehara 
settled down and held the Rams 
scoreless through four innings.

Atthe start of the fifth inning, the 
Tritons were cruising, having given . 
up only one run on one hit. But then, 
in what has become more the norm 
than the exception, everything fell 
apart. 

The Triton defense and pitch-
ing faltered again , making mis-
takes which led to Ram runs. Sud-
denly, the score read 8-4 in favor 
of Cornell. UCSD finished with 
three errors - an escapable tally, 
had it not committed them at all 
the wrong times. 

"You can ' t give any team fi ve or 
six outs in one inning," Triton Head 
Coach Robert Fletcher said. 

UCSD went on to lose by a score 
of 8-6, hitting into a crucial double 
play in the bottom ofthe sixth to end 

a potential go-ahead threat. 
The second-ranked Kingsmen 

came to La Jolla on Wednesday, 
March 19 to ball Ie the Tritons, who 
were looking to avenge two earlier 

losse~ to the same Cal Lu squad. 
The matchup pitted the staff aces 

of both squads against each other, as 
senior southpaw Mike Bryant took 
on Kingsmen star Andrew Barber. 
The two pitchers locked heads in a 
classic duel, sending the game into 
extra innings tied at two. 

Cal Lutheran, however, scored 
two runs in the top of the 10th on 
Eric Burbcn's two-run, RBI single. 
Kingsmen closer Rudy Lesko picked 
up his second victory of the season, 
while Triton counterpart Andy 
deGrasse dropped to 2-2.

Rhodes Walton also performed well , 
a he took eighth in hiS first-ever

The men 's fi eld events were high-

USA track and field broke the old 
mark in the discus, hurling it an 
additional 2' 10" to a distance of

enjoyed the sunny surroundings, as 
he long jumped 25 '6", an 8" im-
provement over the old record. 

UCSD 's field athletes had a fair 
share of success. Geoff Lambert and 
Randy Buehler - both competing 
at the invitational level - finished 
ninth and 11th, respectively, and 
continued to throw well. 

"[Lambert and Buehler] are con-
sistently throwing near their best 
dislances in every meet ," Van 
Arsdale said.

Javelin thrower Bo Harvey al so 

did well , launching his spear to a 
personal record distance of 156' II ", 
which was II th best among the large 
open field . The field events were 
especially well attended because of 
the well -known quality of UCSD's 
facilities for such events as lhe ham-
mer throw and discus. 

"We had people coming up the 
day of the meet and asking if they 

The UCSD Guardian 

could get in [to the field)," Van 
Arsdale said, "I didn'l like saying 
'no' , but I got real good at it. " 

The women ' side was as excit-
ing as the men ' s, as five meet 
records fell . including the Ameri -
can record in the pole vault. Three 
of the other records were also in 
field events -the long jump. di s-
cus and highjump. The final record 
was broken by Inger Miller, who 
ran unattached in the 100 meters 
and finished in a blazing time of 
11.17, easily eclipsing the previ -
ous meet record 0 f I I. 60. 

For UCSD, the highlights began 
in '!le distance events. Paola Avila 
took second in the invitational (ield 
of the 10,000 meters. improving on 
her previous best time from last year 
by well overthree minutes to finish 
in 41 :55.99. Wendy Chiasson al so

Bows Rain on Tritons Twice 
TOP D08: The Hawaii Rainbows, undefeated in conference play and boasting 
the numer-one ranking, came to town and beat UCSD on two occasions 
.,-.w ..... 
Sts"Wrlte, 

Last week's break was not just 
sun and surf for the UCSD men's 
volleyball team, as the Tritons hid 

to continue their play 
in the highly 
competative Moun-
tain Pacific Sports 
Federation. 

The team found 
itself going head-toÂ· 
head with the num-
ber-one ranked Divi-

sion J volleyball squad in the nation, 
the University of Hawaii , which 
made sure tlie UCSO vacation was 
anything but pleasant. 

In the first of thei r two matches, 
the Rainbows, who came to town 
undefeated in conference play, 
flexed their muscles and did not 
give the underdog Tritons any hopes 
of an upset by sweeping the match 

-vn three games. 
Hawaii made it clear early that 

they would be controlling the nets. 
The Tritons were unable to contend 
with the dominant front-line of the 
Rainbows and did not record a block 
throughout the match. In contrast, 
the University of Hawaii was able to 
stuff IO blOCks. 

Despite being slightly over-
matched up front, the Tritons were 
still able to take advantage of sev-
eral opponunities to put up some 
good hilling numbers. Senior Tom 
Black, who has played well regard-

,. 

less of the competition, continued 
his stellar scuon by Ieadin, the Tri-
tons with 20 kills in the fint RIIlCh. 

Sophomore Jon Yams was the 
only other scoring threat for UCSD, 
as he put away six of his nine scor-
ing opportunities. 

"We were a little intimidated the 
first night," Head Coach Doug 
Damevik said, "but the second night 
we set some goals for ourselves-IO 

all but gone, UCSD seuled inlO its 
usuaJ style of play and performed at 
a much higher level. After being 
shut out in blockiRl the previous 
night, the front-line core of Guy 
Mount and Devon Jeffcoat stepped 
up 10 lead the Tritons in out-block-
ing the Rainbows. 

Another first-night struggle to 
plague UCSD was its inconsistency 
in returning serves. 

End of the raInbow?: There was no gold for the Tritons, as they 
scrambled to no avail against the number-one ranked Hawaii team. 

score in double figures and to come 
with more intensity to the gym." 

The Tritons: ranked number three 
in Division III, achieved the goals 
they had set for themselves in the 
second match. With the jitters of 
facing the nation's number-one team 

"We gOl served off the coon in !he 
first match," Dannevik said. "but Matt 
Riley and Jon Yarris passed much 
better in the second [match), and that 
improvedourovenllgame.Asateam, 
we stepped up competitively."

UCSD Salvages Break 
THE Pili: A Triton w.in over Pomona Pitzer 
turns out to be the only victory of the off week 
., NIcole .......... 
GullRllan Repone, 

The UCSD men's tennis team 
pulverized Pomona last Satur-
day, endin, its losing streak over 
Spring Brcalt with a decisive 6-1 
victory over the Sa,ehens. 

Previously that week, the 
Tritons fell to Redlands in a close 
league loss, 3-4, and were swept 
7-0 by Division I Brown Univer-
sity . 

Defeating the Sagehens 
proved easy for the Tritons. Tri-
tons dominated Pomona 
in doubles competition, 
winning all three of the 
matches. 

In the number-one po-
sition, Dan Brounstein de-
feated his opponent, but 
not without a tough battle. 
The match came down to 
the final set, with Brounstein 
trailing 5-3 in the late going. 
However, the top Sagehen was 
unable to maintain his intensity 
and Brounstein came back to grab 
the victory, 7-5 . 

Another example of UCSO's 
unwillingness to lose came from 
fourth -seed Steve Shabel, who 
conquered his opponent easily, 
6-0, 6-0 . The win over the 
Sagehens was just what the Tri-
tons needed to even their season 
record at 6-6 and reaffirm them-
selves as number three in the 
West. 

Unfonunately, UCSD didn't 

fare as well against Brown Uni-
versity on March 24. The Trito,,", 
looked to their lower-seated play-
ers to fill the lineup because top-
sealed J)rounstein, as well as two 
other top players, were unable to 
attend the Sunday match. 

"We played them at half 
strength ," Head Coach Brian 
Turner said. "This match was 
scheduled at the last moment and 
if we had been full strength, I'm 
sure we could have made it com-
petitive." 

Coupled with the lack 
of experience and the pow-
erful play of the opposing 
squad , UCSD was unable 
to prevail. Brown com-
pleted all its victories in 
two sets, and swept the 
doubles matches. 

" It felt good playing 
number one, but it was a tough 
match," Mike Wilson said. "I was 
ahead 3Â· 1 , but my opponent came 
back. It was bad that I lost , but it 
gave a lot of the team a chance to 
get experience." 

Experience was also gained 
in the Triton's square-offagainst 
the University of Redlands on 
March 15. Although UCSD was 
unable to oust the Bulldogs from 
the number-two spot in the West, 
the Tritons remained right on 
their tail in third place. 

With UCSD unable win a 
doubles match, it was up to the

In Saturday's heat, the UCSO 
rower~ finished third to earn a berth

SDSU and UC Irvine. In that event, 
the Tritons finished a strong second, 
beating SDSU by seven and USD 

by 10 seconds. Irvine finished a 
distant 20-plu, seconds back. 

Because only fi ve teams were en-
tered in the event, the novice B crew 
competed in a straight final. In the 
preliminary heat on Saturday to deter-
mine lane placings,the Tritons placed 
third behind Stanford and UCSB. In 
the fmal race on Sunday, however, 
UCSO faltered, falling to fifth. 

The final Triton boat, a lightweight

which included 1995 NCAA finalists 
from Radcliffe, Villanova and Texas.

suffer from a stroke of bad luck 
which cosl the Triton rowers the 
finish they had expected. 

With Villanova and Radcliffe 
battling at the front, UCSD was in 
the middle of the pack competing 
for third when a boat wake, which, 
according to Triton Head Coach Jack 
Vallerga, "didn' t seem to affect the 
other lanes," literally brought the 
UCSD boat to a Â·halt in ttie water. 

That wake dropped the Tritons 
into a distant sixth . UCSD did man-
age to battle back into fifth place 
before reaching the finish line. The 
final result was nonetheless a disap) 
,ointment for the team.

While the rest of us were relax-
ingonthebeachlastw~k,theUCSD 

women's tennis team 
went to work. The 
Trilonsextended their 
season record to 8-5 
by claiming victories 
in two of the three 
contests played over 
Spring Break. 

"We were more 
relaxed and prepared for our matches 
over the break," Triton Head Coach 

Liz LaPlante said. "The team didn't 
have to corne from class and get 
psyched up for the matches." 

UCSO staned ilS vacation sched-
ule Wednesday against NAIA com-
petitors from Westmont College. 
The Tritons overpowered the War-
riors easi Iy, taking the win, 9-1. 

The UCSO women knew that a 
talented Division I squad from Cal 
Stale Fullenon would prove to be 
much tougher competition on Friday. 
Against the Titans, Michelle 
Malenphansakul contributed to the 
Tri.ton cause at the number-one singles 

spot. defeating her Fullenon counter-
pan. 6-2, 6-1. Hilary Somers also 
grabbed a big win for UCSD at num-
ber -three singles. After losing the first 
set, 6-0, Somers fought back to win 
the second set, 6-4. Somers' strength 
and endurance prevailed in the termi-
nal match, as she snatched the win 
from her Fullerton opponent. 6-2. 

The remaining Tritons played 
consistently, but finished one win 
short of victory as the squad from 
CSUF squ~zed past UCSD by a 
final score of 5-4. 

UCSO's most important match of 
the break was against Pomona Col-
lege on Saturday. The Tritons beat 
their perennial Division m rivals, the 
Sagehens, for the second time this 
season. After winning two of the three 
doubles matchups, the Tritons tri -
umphed in four of thCir six singles 
conteslS to claim the 6-3 win. 

Although Miki Kurokawa and 
Yumi TakemOlo were defeated by 
their Pomona counterparts, 9-7, at 
the number-one doubles spot. the 
nu mber -two duo of Malenphansakul 
and Somers overpowered its oppo-
nen ts, 8-5 . Li kewise, Susan 
Huberman and Annie Hoecker took 
the win, 8-5, at the lhird position. 

"Our doubles teams are getting 
used to playing together," LaPlante 
said. "They' re playing aggressively, 
coming in and taking control of the 

Alii Mc'saac/GuBfdiBrl net." 

During Spring Break, the 
UCSO golf team took to the road 
to compete in two highly 
competetive tournarnenlS. 

At their first stop, the 
Tritons look on Division I 
and 0 squads in the Cal 
State Stanislaus Tourna-
ment at the Turlock Coun-
try Club. UCSD finished in 

triple bogey ,or a lhree-over-
par seven, on the lasl hole to 
make the scoreappearcloser

"Oakhurst is a hellish 
golf course," Wydra said. 
" On a normal day, the 
winds get up to about 47 
miles per hour. Needless to 
say, there are no toupees 

315 on the first day of competi-
tion, UCSD came back strong to 
post a low 303 with the help of 
Arnie Campbell's 73. Campbell 
finished the tournament with a rare 
eagle deuce on the last hole. 

On that hole, Campbell, whom 
teammates refer to as "Arnie 
Palmer", took out his driver and 
teed off from 289 yards away. 
reaching the fringe of the green. 
From there, he calmly sunk the 15-
foot putt for the eag le. 

Pete Roberts finished the tour-
ney strong as well , tallying a 74 in 
the final round after shooting an 
80 and 82 on the first day. Brian 
Bazze!'s 80, 84 and 76 put him 
third on the Triton squad. 

" It was a very good showing 
for us," Triton Head Coach Mike 
Wydra said. 

allowed on the course." 
Today, the Tritons head to EI 

Toro 10 lee off at the Coto De Caza 
Country Club in the UC Irvine Invi-
tational. As the only Division m 
squad, UCSD is ready to test ilSelf 
versus the best golfers in California. 

"This will be theÂ· biggest and 
most prestigious tournament we 
have ever been in," Wydra said. "I 
don't even know how we got in. 
There are four PAC-IO and four 
WAC-I Oschoolscompeting, includÂ· 
i ng some tough Division n squads." 

Wydra believes this will be a 
great learning experience for his 
golfers, regardlessoftheoutcome. 

Som-up: Hilary Somers has been tearing up her opponents, as Although Kurokawa vacated the 
UCSD then traveled to Oakhurst 

Country Club in Walnut Creek to

"We're ranked fourth in Divi -
sion 01, while Arizona and others 
are ranked in the top nationwide," 
he said. "The guys will be able to 
compare their game to some of the 
best. Plus, we won ' t be scared of 
anyone after we play at this high 
level of competition." UCSD rolls up an 8-5 record. See DOUBLE. Page 15

An Orangeman 

Final score: University of 
Kentucky 112, Syracuse 65. 
And it won ' t be that close. 

UCSD Hosts Spring Blast 
That's what the scoreboard 

will read after tonight's 
debacle, otherwise known as 
thc NCAA championship 
game. The number-two team in 
the nation will go up against 
the 41 st-ranked team. Sounds 
like it will be a dandy, right? 

Monday night 's game will 
be a mismatch and a bore. I 
want to know what moron was 
in charge of the seeding 
process for the NCAA 
basketball tournament. 
Because whoever it was, he did 
a crappy job. 

There were two dominant 
teams during the season in 
college hoops: Kentucky and 
the University of Massachu-
setts. Compiling 32-1 and 35-2 
records, respectively, no other 
teams were more heavily 
favored to win the big dance. 

But somehow, I and the rest 
of America watched these 
same twlol teams battle it out in 
the semifinals. Somebody on 
the NCAA committee should 
have realized that these two 
teams should play in opposite 
brackets, so that they wouldn't 
meet before the championship 
game. But alas, moronic minds 
prevailed. 

Instead, we have to watch 
the best team in college, UK, 
playa sorry team with one 
good player.

HUGE: Over 2,400 
entrants competed at 
the Spring Break Invite 
By Dan Kraft 
Sports Editor 

Last Saturday, the UCSD track 
and field team played host to Divi-
sion I, II, III and the world, as over 

2,400 athletes repre-
senti ng 89 clubs, 
countries and schools 
converged on Tliton 
Track and Field Sta-
dium for the Spring 
Break Open. 

It was the hope of 
UCSD Head Track 

Coach Ted Van Arsdale that the 
quality of competition in this year's 
meet would continue to raise the 
stature ofTriton track and field . The 
meet's elite did not disappoint, as 
nine stadium records were set -
including an American record in the 
women's pole vault. 

It was UCSD's Tiffany Smith 
who achieved that feat, clearing a 
height of 13'2.5" to better the old 
mark by one inch, selling a new 
American record. 

Stadium and meet records for the 
men were set in the 10,000- and 
5,OOO-meter distance races, as well 
as the long jump and discus. It was 
Brazilli.an national team member 
Wander Moura who shattered the 
old record in'the 5,000 with a timeof 
13:36.85. 

That race was also the stage for 
some of the top Triton athletes, as 

Blur of apHd: UCSO's Matt Amero hurdles through the night during the Spring Break Open. 

J.J. Castner, Gavin Klinger and 
Bryan Leek (all competing in the 
tough invitational field) each had 
personal bests en route to 5th, 8th 
and 12th place, respectively. 

"BecaUie of the quality and no-
toriety of our faci lity ," V an Arsdale 
said, "our athletes get a chance to 
compete with some of America's 
best and learn how to become better 

athletes." 
Castner (14:25.3) set a new 

school record in the 5,000, improv-
ing by almost three seconds on his 
own record, and earned an auto-
matic bid to the NCAA champion-
ships. Klinger, who competed in the 
event for the flnt time this season, 
improved by over 18 seconds to 
finish in 14:37.13, also automati-

cally qualifying for a trip to the 
Division m championships. 

Other successes on the track for 
the UCSD men occurred in the 
3,OOO-meter steeplechase, as John 
Walsh, competing in the invitational 
di vision, grabbed fourth despite tak-
ing a spill. Walsh tumbled over the 
first hurdle of the race but had the

Citing problems with Editor in chief Tedd 
Ladd's conservative politics, Guardwn editors 
announced yesterday at their own press confer-
ence that they had voted 10 oust the editor, along 
with the paper's private corporation status, in 
favor of converting the Guardian to a co-op. 

"The switch from a capitalistic parasite to a 
planet-saving co-op was inevitable," the 
entireGuardwn Collective said in a unified voice. 
"With the advent of that facist Tedd Ladd and his 
neo-Nazi politics, it became apparent that a revo-
lution was in the making. The collective also 
decided that producing a biweekly paper was too ' 

stressful, so we thought we'd copy the Last Indi-
cator and tum out a piece of crap once a month." 

Hugged by the members of the Food Co-op and 
Groundwork Books while they made their an-
nouncement, Guardian revolutionaries denied re-
ports that violence played a role in the uprising. 

"A revolution of the people and not the police

New Charter 
! 

School Finally 
Approved 
ON-CAMPUS: Branch of 
'Memphis Carborator 
College' will be at Muir 
By Peppermint Patty 
Charlie Brown 's lover 

While UCSD Interim Chancellor 
Marjorie aserio has yet to give her ap-
provalto the on-campus charter high school 
proposal sponsored by Marshall Provost 
Cecil Lytle, she gave the nod Friday to a 
charter school of a different kind, which 
would be located at Muir College. 

The school, officially listed as a branch 
of the Memphis Carborator College (MCC) 
system in Tennessee, would provide high 
school drop-outs the opportunity to learn 
how to repair cars, trucks and airplanes, 
while in the comfortable con tines of a top 
UC college campus. 

"This is a great day for UCSD," Caserio 
said. "With [Lytle's) proposal, I was con-
cerned about messy incidents and underage 
dating. But with MCC coming to our cam-
pus, I know all our administrators' cars will 
be in tip-top shape." 

'This whole Muir charter school pro-
posal is gonna be jolly good!" she added 
with a silly English accent. 

Muir College was selected as the official 
si te for the carborator school due to its 
convenience and the minimal degree of im-
pact to the Muir campus. Muir officials 
offered several of their buildings to house 
the college, including HSS and AP & M. 

"Hell, our students are more concerned 
about marijuana growth than anything else," 
Muir Provost Patrick Ledden said. '" told 
Caserio that you could put a death camp in 
the middle of Muir and no one would notice. 
She just said as long as there weren't any 
'messy incidents,' she'd give the go-ahead 
to Muir. And I'm tickled pink she decided to 
stick with the proud Muir tradition." 

With the addition of MCC, Muir students 
will now have a new "Pointless Require-
ment" added to their degree. For all Muir 
students graduating after 1996, the new re-
quirement gives them an option between 
Mufflers 101, Hot-Wiring Made Easy 205, 
Turbines: The Silent Killers, or the normal 
two-part Muir College Writing Series.

Professor Peter Irons 
Attacks New Mascot 

MORE CRAP. -.. 
PADRES: The swingin' friar is the current target 
for Irons' crusade against hapless Christians 
By Pilt Robertson 
Playing wIth fire 

In the wake of his recent vic-
tory over Christian groups for the 
right to hold an atheist Easter ser-
vice under the Mount Soledad 
eros, UCSDpolitical science Pro-
fessor Peter Irons announced yes-

the mascot itself, except when it is 
pelted by tomatoes and other large 
fruits by Irons and his renegade 
atheist clan. 

" I don't know what his problem 
is," SDSU ~tudent and Padre fan 
Biff Smiff (sic) said. "Someone 
must have twisted his ponytail in 

terday that his next 
target was the San 
Diego Padre~ ' ma~Â­
COl. 

The beloved 
friar. clothed in a 
brown robe and 
swinging an over-
sized bat, was the 
Padres' official 
mascot until its de-
mise in 1974. This 
year, however, se-
nior officials of the 
baseball organiza-
tion elected to bring 
back the character 
- and a new slo-
gan, " Keep the 
Faith" - in time 
for the start of the 
1996 season.

UCSD adminis-

slightly skeptical 
of [rons' latest 
cause. 

"[Irons] is a

UCSD Interim 
Chancellor and 
devout Padres fan 
Majorie Caserio 
said. "He's off the

Outraged fans have vowed to

Irons' next efforts will be di-
rected toward pulling out all the 
white crosses at Arlington Memo-
rial Cemetery in Washington. D.C .â€¢ 
and boycotting the Federal Reserve 
over the use of "In God We Trust" 
on all Uniled States' currency.

ERRATAS: 
â€¢ In reference to an April 23. 1996 article in the Guardian. A.S. VP Rnance 
Edmondo Robinson was called "the spawn of Satan, pure evil in human form. " 
In fact, Robinson is not any of these things. but ~ is a recovering alcoholic. 
â€¢ In reference to a May 25. 1975 issue of the Guardian. "verisillimltude" was 
misspetlled. 
â€¢ In reference to an April 1 , 1996 erratum in the Guardian, Edmonda Robinson 
was Incorrectly refered to as â€¢ a recovering alcoholic," In fact, Robinson 
current,lydrinks himself into a stupor every night, even during A.S. meetings, 

For the first time since UCSD opened its doors in 
1964, a member ofthe student population has engaged 
in sexual Intercourse - and with another human being. 
not him- or herself. Buck Naked. a Muir College seventh-
year senior reported having sex in his room Friday night. 

"I was going to e-mail my girlfriend, who I met on the 
Internet. but the real thing seemed much more excit-
ing," Naked said. 

The campus reaction to Naked's revelation ilicited 
mixed responses. While some feel sex may be a good 
thing. others see it as a dangerous trend which will harm 
several factions on campus. 

Officials from the UCSO Police Department said that 
although this is a rare occurence. they do not believe it 
will have a negative Impact on the campus. 

"We were actually hoping for something like this." 
Police Chief Maudie Bobbitt said. "Hopefully everyone 
at UCSO will follow [Naked's) example. This will reduce 
the excessive amount of sexual harassment found In 
many offices on campus, Including our own. " 

However. personnel from UCSO's Office of Academic 
Computing Services had mixed feelings about making 
an example of Naked's behavior. 

"I know that sex is an appealing thing, " Head Com-
puter Analyst Lester Prudish. "But if all the computer 
nerds start having sex, we may have to shut down our 
services due to lack of interest. Who's gonna e-mail if 
they're busy hamg sex?" 

Prudish added that students should practice their 
computer skills instead of sexual positions. 

' Technology is the wave of the future. ' Prudish said. 
"Not sex." 

ScrIpps to ContInue Blasting 
WINdes out of the Water 

Continuing its efforts to preserve ocean resources, 
UCSO's Scripps Institute of Oceanography (SIO) has 
broadened its Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate 
and Carnage (ATOC&C) experiment. Focused on the 
phenomenon of global warming and striving for the 
elimination of unwanted plankton predators - such as 
whales - ATOC&C bounces hlgh-power sound waves 
under the PacifIC Ocean. 

"It seems that while the ocean temperature has 
remained stable over the last century. the whale popu-
lation has exploded since becoming a protected species 
in the 195Os. The sound waves' success at killing as 
many of those predators as possible makes the whole 
$1.5 billion experiment worthwhile," ATOC&C Director 
and Professor of Plankton Studies Sam Enella said . 

Enella added that. as one of the most intelligent 
creatures on Earth. whales should be considered a 
national security threat. "The whale overpopulation 
problem is a threat to plankton and therefore the world'<; 
oxygen supply and mankind's survival, " Enella said. 
"Further rneasures need to be taken to blast that 
accursed species off the planet. Â· 

UCSD Professor of Exobiology Ester Tarestrial said 
that the experiment had succeeded in wiping out half of 
the blue whale population in the Pacific, and was really 
annoying killer whales in tne Arctic circle. 

"Those fat Sea World losers really hate the gangsta-
rap music we're blasting down there." Terestrial said. "It 
serves 'em right , they ate my daughter."

WHITE AMERICA 
IS RACIST 
By Kathleen DooIytIe 
Equal opportumty chick 

Every five minutes, an Aztec 
child scrapes her knee Qn the 
ground. 

Every twenty minutes, an Aztec 
woman bl/rns her hand rooking dinÂ· 
nerji)r her hI/shand and childrell. 

Every Iwenlyfou r hOllrs, af/olhe,. 
Aztec mtm /tIlls to his lJealh after 
accidently .flipping off 0/1 ancient 
Aztec pyramid he was climbing. 

Either tirat, or a skyscraper.

prt.!'~lOn , rape, und oppre"lon. 
" Opprc~"I(>n" IS Ihe key word. 

Since the first day England 
establi shed her colonies of to-
bm:co growers and raei ~t~ on the 
shllrc~ 01 Virginia, si nce the lirst day 

pain sent her missionaric~ and rap-
Ists \0 the halls of Montel.uma, since 
the ~rst day France sent her fur traders 
and racists and rapists 10 Canada. 
Amerka has been a hot bed ofoppres-
sion. Oppression, oppression, oppres-
sion. Well, the French weren't as bad 
as Ihe rest, butlhcy were still white. 

Who would win in a lighl between 
an Altec and a Triton'? A Triton, of 
course. Thc Aztec's food hru. been 
slolen from her. The A71CC's land has 
been raped from hcr. The Aztec's 
spiriluality has been taken from her. 
In a word, white men huveoppressed 
the Aztec beyond all hope of resis-
tance and restilution. 

A Triton - a god created by a 
civiljzation which Whitey reveres as 
thebastionofcivilization. even though 
the Romans were really a sweaty, 
swarthy, soon, olive-skinned Medi-
terranean people, whose culture was 
stolen directly from Africans- would 
kick some Aztec booty. Besi<lcs, a 
Triton has a sharp, pointy Ihing called 
a trident which could spear anybody 
to death. Aztecsdon' t have such weap-
ons because corporate Caucasian 
Amerikkka stole everything. 

According to H.T.F. Jones, the 
politically aware gounnet eookbook 
writer who has researched Aztec co-
mestibles, "Spanish cuisine is hardly 
deserving of thC appelation; hardly 
one example of its food C8MOI di-
rectly trace itsclcvelopmentfrom Y8ri-
OIlS Native American menus. Aan, 
for instance, is no( a Spanish clcvelop-

all good things. Indeed, 
more often than not, America is the 
raper of all good things, rtlping other 
I:u ltures of good stuff with which they 
decorate their own culture." 

With a bee-bop pirit and hip-hop 
lyric, black youths today experience 
life much like the Aztecs did 400 
years ago. TIle citizen~ of the U.S. 
Hate have trod on the backs of black 
youths like the Spanish trod on the 
backsof Aztec youths. And much like 
Aztec youths did Ihen, black youths 
wi II continue 10 resist Whitey unti I 
Whiley gi ves her his due. Oppression. 

You might wonder why 1 am so 
persistant in the pursuit of equality, 
libeny and all that other stuff. Well, 
one day, I asked my father, "Daddy, 1 
want a new BMW. Last year's model 
is so old now. And I want il red with 
gold trim - that blue color on the old 
one with silver trim is so passe 

And Daddy put down his flute and 
said, "Honey, you're in college now, 

and even though 
you do not have to pay a thing to 
suppon yourself, you have to reali ze 
the importance of not buying a new 
car every year. After all, money does 
nol grow on tree '!" 

And as Daddy sk.ipped away play-
Ing violin. 1 came across a realization: 
Daddy was right, money did not grow 
on trees - not on our trees anyway. 
Oppression. 

Whitey doesn't let Daddy or any 
other minority own the money trees. 
Sure, we can have apple tree or or-
ange trees, but not money Irees -
Whitey kccps them to himself. 

So, u nti I Whitey acknowledges the 
eulture from which the Spanish stole 
flan, until Whitey stops treading on 
backs of minorities, and until Whitey 
lets blacks have some of those money 
trees, the Aztec will continue gelling 
her ass kicked by the Triton. Oppres-
sion, oppression!

WESTERN CULTURE RuLES 
By Farsam Shaddup 
Least special to the 
Dlsre-Guardian 

Smce UCSD first erected her 
mighly and herculean halls on the 
ht lis and bluffs and mountains of the 
preposterously beautiful and lovely 
and gorgeous La Jolla, one prevail-
ing and perilou~ question has re-
mained unexamined and unan-
swered Within the public forum : If 
an Aztec and a Tnton were to par-
ticipate In Ii~ticurr\ who would 
truimph as the greatest?

you may gamble your entire estate

stlII'KI.I.<illl over an Aztee' s 

an Aztec's moral being. If an 
Aztec were to call a Triton out, 

and that Triton ~ere to come 
out and light lhis Aztec, then that 
Aztec would get his moral being 
roy aJi y and fastidiously kicked. And 
ira Triton were to think 
tohimself,"Youknow, 
I wanna kick some And.

by aying that most readers won 't be 
able to understand what I'm writing

Because the fact thJt a Triton 
will kick an ALlec's moral being is 
as much an axiol ' l as it is a maxim. 
as true today as it was 2.000 years 
ago, when the Greco-Roman civili-
zation would have absolutely, com-
pletely and utterly de~troyed the 
Aztec civilization had not a thing 
called the Atlantic Ocean separated

San Diego State athletic teams al-
ways pummel and pound on UC San

Someofyou ignorami might em-
ploy a certain a logical 
and even DeCanesian 
approach and answer,

would go and kick an 
Aztec's moral being, 
because there is nocon-
test. An Aztec would 
get his moral being 
kicked by a Triton ev-

would kick an Aztec's

Consider: A Triton 

has this pointy thing 
called, coincidentally 

prefer to be andlieandgypandcheat. 
Allow me to illuminate. 

an e.ephant. Since thc beginning 
and incidentally, a trident. And with 
this pointy thing - which is almost 
like a spear but isn't because it has 
three pojnty and sharp things in- ' 
stead of just one - a Triton would 
stick an Aztec like the mere mortal 
an Aztec is. Allow me to explicate. 
An Aztec is a mere mortal- and by 
the way, a Triton is nol a mortal, but 
a god, which is much better than a 
mortal, because gods don 't have limi-
tations and boundries like mortals 
do (sometimes I think Ishould really 
have been reincarnated as Apollo,

n a strange alliance of music 
and politics, President Bill 
Clinton sat in with George 
Clinton and Parliament during 
Friday night's rousing,two-hour 
performance at RIMAC (the 
Spring Break concert had been 
rescheduled because an earlier 
date was canceled due to slow 
ticket sales). 

"Take it, white boy," George 
said as Bill staggered on stage 
amidst a cloud of smoke (appar-
ently he had been doing a bit of 
inhaling before the show). Bill 
played a saxophone solo that 

didn't quite pack the punch of George's 
funk but still received an enthusiastic 
response from the sold-out crowd. 

The atmosphere backstage was also 
celebratory. At one point , Bill said he 
was considering telling Vice-president 
AI Gore that George would replace him 
in the November election. 

-

"AI is a real stick-in-the-mud. He 
doesn't have soul, if you know what I 
mean," Bill confided to MTV's Tabitha 
Soren, who asked more than once if she 
and Bill could talk in private. 

George responded to the news by say-
ing, "If I were vice president, I'd really 
have to paint the White House black." 
He added that he would keep his hair in 
dreads no matter what the White House 
dress code might be. 

Taking credit for bringing the Clintons 
together was A.S. Programmer, OJ Moon. 
Although OJ Moon has had trouble consis-
tently booking shows at RIMAC (aside 
from the clearly underrated Christian rock 
concens) and bringing top-name acts to 
campus, he came through with this show. 

"All year long, I've brought the dope, 
hip-hop shit to the students at UCSO -
Bootsy, Ben Harper and now George 
Clinton," he said, adding that the rev-
enue from the Clinton-Clinton bash more 
than made up for what he lost on the 

BEER-O-RAMA 
see page H34 

original show. "Now, it 's time for me to 
move on . I'm going to start my own 
record label, called Go~Down On It. It 
will Lc the shit, just you wait." 

Even former A.S. Programmer, Mateo 
Sneer was impressed by the event. Mak-
ing a rare appearance on campus, the 
Tijuana resident said, ". had lost faith in 
the kid [DJ Moon] but he redeemed him-
self with this show. I may have brought 
Everclear and Rage Against the Machine 
to campus, but DJ Moon has topped any -
thing I did. Oh, I got a story for you. I 
was in TJ last night , and I met a girl ..... 
But Sneer was cut off by the roar of the 
crowd, calling for one more encore. 

As Bill stumbled onto the stage for 
another sax solo, he stood at the edge of 
the stage and looked into the crowd. 
Seeing the mass of hands and bodies 
awaiting him, he took a running start and 
leaped into the welcoming crowd. Eddie 
Vedder and Billy Corgan look out- the 
kids have a new hero.

RED SCARE 
KARL MARX 

The Revolution 
Won't Be on TV 

Given the recent success of 
the United Auto Workers ' 
strike against General Motors, 
it seems that organized labor's 
renaissance has dawned. We 

r t must not forget past injustices 
against workers, however, for 
the uncaring hand of big 
business always remains raised 
to smash the rights of the 
proletariat in thi s country. We 
should never forget the martyrs 
of the last major labor conflict: 
the hard-working baseball 
players of America. 

RIMAC BOUND: Reasons for UCLA guard's defection are increased 
playing time, a chance to take more threes and loss to Princeton 

Who will ever forget the 
day the baseball players went 
on strike. They sacrificed it all 
- their livelihood, the 
playoffs, the World Series -
to make a stand against low

A Fungus Amongu5 

In a press conference held last 
Friday afternoon in the RIMAC main 
arena, UCSD Athletic Director Judy 
Sweet announced that the Tritons have 
lured UCLA sophomore Toby Bailey 
away from Pauley Pavilion and to the 
comfortable confines of Tritondom. 

''I'm so excited," Sweet said after 
the conference. "I mean,the curly hair 
and the braces, and how he's so ath-
letic, Ijustcan' t wait." 

Baily cited several reasons for leav-
ing UCLA, including the loss to' 
Princeton in the NCAA tournament 
and his deflating scoring average. He 
finally sellied on UCSD because he 
felt the offense was more suited to his 
style of play. 

"I feel that UCSD will afford me 
the distinct opportunity to explore my 

insofar untapped scoring propensi-
ties," Bailey spewed. "I firmly be-
lieve that 70 points per game and 15-
20 three-point attempts are well within 
mycapabilities- featsthattheUCSD 
offense most definitely shall . grant 
me," 

The Triton basketball team mem-
bers were also enthusiastic about the 
signing, feeling that Bailey will give 
the team the added dimension it needs 
to defeat conference powerhouses like 
the Whittier Poets and Santa Cruz 
Banana Slugs. 

"We always seem to have trouble 
scoring more points than the other 
teams," Triton center Matt Aune said. 
"Toby Bailey scores a lot of points. I 
thi nk that 's neat." 

When asked if the Tritons really 
need yet another three-point shooter, 
most players responded favorably . 

â€¢ pay and poor working condi-
tions. In doing so, they boldly 
stood in front of the titans of 
industry and said: "We will not 
accept wages that keep our 
families in this di smal lifestyle. 
Furthermore, we will not rest 
until we can work less than six 
days a week." The owners 
quaked in their boots when 
confronted with ~uch a resolute 
enemy. They could only settle 
with the wealth-producers in 
one way, by negotiating with 
the players they had so brutally 
oppressed. 
~ I was proud to be one of the 

proletariat that day. All of us 
- the factory workers, the 
gravediggers, the dental 
hygenists - stood proudly 
next to the downtrodden 
revolutionaries. Barry Bonds,

Unfortunately. the struggle 
in baseball is not over. 
Baseball players are still forced 
to work under abhorrent 
conditions, sacrificing their 
bodies 'for the benefit of the 
ownerS. The tragic list of 
injuries players suffer through-
out the season is proof of the 
owner's uncaring attitude. 
Many players are forced to rely 
on illegal drugs to kill the pain 
fromlhei .. Ilighily struggle. 

We cannot allow this abuse 
to continue. The baseball 

â€¢ â€¢ players of America and their 
families are counting on us all 
to lake a stand against the 
bourgeoisie owners. They own 
the stadiums, the hoi dog 
factories and the television 
stations. All we have are our 
fists, our backs and our ball.

Steak and sausage combo 
It 's been that kind of year for the 

UCSD riverboat gambling team. 
You know, the kind of year when 

you double-down and 
tum up big money. The 
kind of year when you 
buy insurance and the 
dealer hits the jackpot. 
The kind of year when 
you ' re playing Pai 
Gow poker and you ' ve 

got a pair of aces and three-of-a-
kind. Well, that kind of year. 

In any case, the Triton tricksters 
turned up on board the Queen Mary 
last week, as they took on Division 
I powerhouses UNL V and Univer-
sity of Reno in a three-way, winner-
take-all poker tourney. 

When the dust had settled and all 
the chips had been counted, UCSD 
emerged victorious, bringing home 
a cool $4S million in change.

In other poker action, Triton var-

his way into a nifty $50,000 pot, the

tricks - ensured the victory for the 
Tritons.

UCsD Looks To 
Next Season 
DISAPPOINTMENT: Triton players felt they 
were snubbed from post-season tournament 
By 00 
The writer formerly known as â€¢ 

As the 1996 season comes to a 
close, the Tritons can only think of 
what could have been. 

After finishing higher than any-
one anticipated this season, the 
UCSD squad faced disappointment 
as it was denied a bid for the playoffs 
late last week. While the team didn't 
have as good a record as many tearns 
seeded in the toumarnent, the kind 
of heart and character it displayed 
shouldn't have gone unrecognized. 

The toumament selection com-
mittee completely overlooked the 
fact that UCSD posted a dominating 
victory over one of the tearns which 
was selected in its place. 

"Y cab, I think their bus broke 
down somewhere in Barstow," said 
a Triton junior in reference to the 
overpowering defeat of the nation-
ally ranked squad. "Although they 
sent some of their cheerleaders on 
ahead, and they made a game of il" 

The player went on to say how he 
couJdn'tbelicvelhil his Triton team, 

Dw .... : 
Sleepy, Grumpy, 
Sneezy, Doc, 
Bashful, Dopey 
and one more 
that we just 
can't 
remember. Can 
you? 

which was labeled by some as the 
best Division ill team of all time, 
was left out of the tourney. 

"We also beat that travelingjun-
ior high school team and the Sisters 
of Our Lord and Saviorall-starsquad 
- Don't forget," he said. 

Other team members echoed his 
sentiments and felt betrayed by the 
selection committee. "We sucked. I 
don't think there's ever been a worse 
tearn in the history of modem sports," 
a player said. "We could barely beat 
ourselves in practice." 

The Triton Head Coach accepted 
the disappointment, but remained 
optimistic about next year. 

"Make it stop, please make it 
stop," he said. ''I'll kill myself if I 
have to coach this tearn next year." 

Some of the Triton players, 
knowing they can't dwell on this 
most unjust of circumstances, have 
already begun looking forward to 
next year. " heard coach said he'd 
buy us all new unifonns and shoes if 
we decided not to play forthetcam," 
one player exclaimed.
