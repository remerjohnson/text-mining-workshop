Event Celebrates Black History 
Boys and girls from Keiller Middle School move 
Price Center audien~e with African American poetry 
Staff Writer 

Hundreds of people gathered in the Price 
Center Plaza last Thursday at noon to watch 
the Black History Celebration. 

The event was part of a move to increase 
student awareness of African Americans' con-
tributions to American history as part of Black 
History Month. 

The celebration featured various acts dis-
playing cultural traditions that originated 
from the African continent, ranging from 
African stilt walkers and Bomani drummers to 
a step show put on by the students of the 
Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity and a performance 
by the UCSD Gospel Choir. 

The boys and girls of Keiller Middle 
School were also on hand to perform a mon-

. tage entitled "Facing the Rising Sun: During 
this presentation, Mrs. Davis and her sixth 
grade students took center stage in the Price 
Center Plaza and electrified the crowd by 
reading from the works of various African-
American poets, writers and leaders, including 
Harriet Tubman and Langston Hughes. 

One such student was Deandre Lester, a 
sixth grader at Keiller Middle School, who 
passionately read two poems written by 
Langston Hughes, an African American poet 
who became popular during the Harlem 
Renaissanct of the 1920s. 

"[ think it was a really good presentation: 
Lester said. "[ was [nervous) at first, but then 
after [ said my first part [ wasn't that nervous: 

The children's performance was well 
received by the crowd, which consisted of stu-
dents, parents and university employees. 

One spectator was Kristin LeAndre, a uni-
versity employee who admits she came to see 
the step show, but was impressed by the chil-
dren's performance. 

"[ thought it was great, the kids were won-
derful: LeAndre said. "They were very artic-
ulate [for) a middle school." 

The Marshall Deall of Student Affairs, 
Ashanti Houston Hands, who served as the 
MC for the event, feels that black history is an 
important part of America's past.

Juvenile Cancels, 
F.o.N. Fills In at 
Wintertest Friday 
Low turnout does not hurt 
performance by Lucy Pearl 
By MAn SCHRADER 
Associate News Editor 

Despite the cold winter weather outside, 
F.o.N., Sprung Monkey and Lucy Pearl 
warmed up the stage for all in attendance at 
Winterfest Friday night. 

"With the lineup change, I think the com-
mittee did a good job putting it together," said 
A.S. Festival Committee member Mike Hayes. 

The committee that organized the concert 
stated that the show was supposed to feature 
rap group juvenile, who canceled when its lead 
singer became ill. 

"juvenile said he had an ear infection and 
couldn't fly from Miami on Thursday," said A.S 
Co-Festivals • Coordinator Priya Mohan. "So 
Thursday morning until Thursday night, we 
tried to find another band but it didn't happen: 

Once juvenile canceled, F.o.N signed on to 
play the opening set as Lucy Pearl became the 
lead act . 

Some of those in attendance deemed it 
unfortunate that only a small crowd showed 
up for F.o.N.'s performance. 

"[t was good, although there weren't really 
enough people there yet to give them the cred-
it they deserved: said Muir sophomore Puum 
Sill. "The drummer kicks ass and I think he's 
only like 11 : 

Similar sentiments were expressed about 
Lucy Pearl. The band performed 15 songs, 
including their Grammy-nominated song, "I 
Want to Dance Tonight." 

"It didn't seem like there were too many 
people there at the show," said Marshall 
sophomore Jeff Lee. "It seemed strange to me 
since they are pretty well-known and they put 
on a good show: 

Regardless, the band members themselves 
said the crowd supported them well , which 
made it easier to have a good performance.

for Lucy Pearl. "Everybody was really cool, espe-

Student Athletes Voice Cone'erns at Open Forum 
Conference aims to solve problems such as conflicting academic and athletic commitments 
By GEOFF DlmllCH 
Staff Writer 

UCSD students gathered 
Thursday evening to express con-
cern over the increasing difficul-
ties of balancing academics and 
intercollegiate athletics. 

The open forum, held at the 
J-K. Wood conference room on the 
Warren campus. was sponsored by 
the Warren College Community 
Development Council. 

Suzie Asfoor of the Community 
Development Council organized 
the forum to begin a dialogue 
between student athletes, the ath-
letic department and the UCSD 
administration on how they can 
come together to better serve the 
needs of student athletes. 

UCSD Ath[etic Director Earl 
Edwards, Assistant , Athletic 

Director Ken Grosse and Warren 
College Provost David jordan were 
present to respond to the numer-
ous issues and questions brought 
forth by those in attendance. 

The fundamental problem is 
that there is no university-wide 
policy concerning missed class 
work due to travel and competi-
tion. Professors have full jurisdic-
tion over the academic procedures 
in their class and this leads to 
varying standards for different stu-
dents, resulting in confusion. 

The forum was an attempt to 
better understand these problems 
so they can be corrected. 

Student athletes spoke of the 
problems that occur when inter-
collegiate competitions occur 
simultaneously with classes and 
exams. Most of the time, when 
athletes have to miss an exam due 

to travel, professors allow them to 
take exams prior to departure or 
upon return. 

The main concern among ath-
letes in attendance was having to 
choose between taking an exam 
or participating in a competition. 

Men's tennis team captain 
Everett Schroeter noted that his 
team has been at less than full 
strength on numerous occasions 
because of players needing to take 
exams for which professors would 
not allow a compromise. 

Another problem addressed was 
compulsory attendance policies in 
mandatory classes such as 
Dimensions of Culture and 
Making of the Modern World. With 
priority registration, many conflicts 
have been avoided, but they still 
occur. Student athletes will often 
use their allowable absences on 

game days or travel. hoping they do 
not actually get sick and need to be 
absent from class. 

The general consensus among 
student athletes at the forum was 
that academics have and always 
will take precedence over athletics, 
but compromise should not be 
such an uphill battle. 

Student athletes complained 
that some professors are under the 
impression that athletes at UCSD 
are athletes firsts and scholars sec-
ond. jordan, Edwards and Grosse 
made it clear that the opposite is 
true. 

Caroline .Kim of the Resident 
Dean Advisory Board also said that 
the forum had been beneficial. 

"This was a good starting point 
to educate athletes: Kim said. "This 
is an issue that can be resolved, but 
we have to work on it:

Winterfest: 
Power crisis caused 
technical difJUulties 
Continued from ..... 1 
cially since most did not know me: 

Lucy Pearl's set did, however, have 
some technical difficulties. During a 
part of their performance the front 
speakers did not work due to 
California's current power shortage. 

Even 'so, loi said the crowd was not 
impacted by such problems. 

" I thought the performance was 
cool: she said. " It was a lot of energy 
and good. I usually don't like to play in 
gymnasiums because the sound is so 
shitty, but even with the ~echnica l ~if­
ficulties, the crowd was stili responsive 
and they must have heard something 
they liked." 

In between the sets of Sprung 
Monkey and Lucy Pearl , each college 
presented a short skit on stage designed 
to increase the participation and energy 
of the audience. Although no college 
was declared the winner, Mohan said 
the event. "Mascot Mayhem: accom-
plished what it was designed to do. 

" It was nice to see some creative, 
crazy people at UCSD who wanted to 
entertain the students: she said. 
"lEach college] had a good time with 
them and the crowd had a good time 
right along with them." 

As part of the skits, Muir College 
Council Chair Cristina Villegas per-
fonned onstage as cupid to advertise the 
upcoming A.S. Loveline event featuring 
Dr. Drew and Adam Corrola March 7. 

For some. this was one of the high-
lights of the show. " I want to see that 
cupid at Loveline right here at RIMAC 
in her sui t." said Revelle junior Tatun 
Bajaj . 

However. not everyone was in 
agreement over the success of this 
year's Winterfest. 

"The night as a whole was a let 
down: said Muir sophomQre Rob 
Buckley. "I wish I went to the library." 

The answer to such complaints 
may be an increased budget for the 
festiva ls staff. 

"The programming staff really can't 
go out ane get a big name because they 
are financially limited as to who they 
can get," said Marshall junior Bryan 
Fisher. " It woulg serve everyone's needs 
if the school budgeted them more 
money and they put on a great show. If 
they do a good job with the money they 
get now. imagine what would happen 
with increased funding." 

History: 
Marshall college sponsored 
black history celebration 
ContInued from .... 1 
Month and African American cul-
ture," Hands said. "We just wanted to 
provide the opportunity for our cam-
pus to be exposed to all the rich tra-
dition through music, dance and the 
spoken word." 

For many students, the celebration 
of black history is truly important. 
African Americans' role in American 
history is often minimized or, in some 
cases. forgonen . 

"We can certainly always do 
more: Hands said. " ' think we do 
make a nice effort on campus, but I 
think when we really feel that the 
level of diversity has been achieved 
that we would all anticipate, Iblack 
history] would be woven into the 
overall curriculum and not just be a 
specific department or separate 
issue." 

Nneka Udoh, a Warren junior, 
admits being troubled that black his-
tory is not always seen as a part of 
American history. 

"Black history is American history, 
and I don't understand why we have 
to take the time to celebrate black 
history on this token month: Udoh 
said. "Why can't we celebrate black 
history every single day?" 

The Black History Celebration 
was sponsored in part by Marshall 
college and the Cultural Association 
Uniting Students through Education, 
better known as C.A.U.S.E.

BRIEFLY 
Supercomputer Center Gets New Brain 

UCSO Chancellor Robert C. Dynes announced 
last Wednesday that , come Feb. 23, Sid Karin, 
the founding director of the San Diego 
Supercomputer Center and the National 

. Partnership for Advanced Computational 
Infrastructure, would become the new senior 
strategic advisor to the director of the center. 
Additional changes include Francine Berman 
signing on as new director of SDSC and NPACI. 

Karin has served as the director of the center 
for 16 years and has made the center an inter-
nationally respected laboratory for computation-
al science and technology. He was also instru-
mental in the successful proposal that lead to 
UCSD's hosting of NPACI. After Karin 's signifi-
cant contribut ions, he desired to return to 
hands-on research, and the new position will 
allow him to do so. 

Berman has worked with UCSD since 1984 
and was the founder of UCSD's Parallel 
Computation and Grid Computing Laboratories. 

Power Conservation SaV •• 
UCSD More Tllen $8,000 a Day 

The Office of the Vice Chancellor announced 
Friday that through campuswide efforts to con-
serve power by shutting off lights and appli-
ances, UCSD saved 10 percent in energy. This 
helped all Californians keep their lights on and 
has led to a savings of over $8,000 per day for 
the university, which is the third-largest con-
sumer of electricity in San Diego Gas & 
Electric's territory. 

The state electric system operator has 
replaced the Stage 3 emergency, which lasted 
for 29 consecutive days, with a less critical 
Stage 1 emergency. 

Jack Hug of the Office of the Vice 
Chancellor emphasized that the crisis is not 
over and that continued cooperation by the 
campus will be necessary to further the 
progress during the remainder of California's 
energy crisis.

Atkinson U ..... Students to 
Take Advantag. of Calanmts 

UC President Richard C. Atkinson urged stu-
dents Friday to take advantage of the state's 
CalGrant program, which provides million of dollars 
in financial aid to California college students every 
year, before the March 2 application deadline. 

Atkinson stressed that students meeting the 
requirements could possibly have their total 
tuition needs met and that unlike loans, grants 
do not need to be repaid. ' 

The CalGrant program pays up to $9,700 
toward tuition and fees to students attending 
private institutions and up to $1,550 for those 
attending California community colleges_ 

Some basic requirements for the program 
include being a legal California resident, attend-
Ing a quallfyJng California post-secondary insti-
tution, being enrolled at least half-time and not 
being in default on a student loan. 

The programs offer both • A· and • B· grants, 
given depending on a student's education status 
and grade point average.

FO 
Children that commit adult crimes such as first degree murder 
should be charged as adults and pay for their horrible actions 
By MARY ONELIA ESTUDILLO 
Staff Wflter 

It is not a war on youth. It is a battle 
against the immeasurable loss of human 
life. personal security and wasted human 
resources. When juve-
nilt: court preservation-
Ists label YOlllh punish-
ment lI1itiatives as repre-
sentative of moral bank-
ruptcy and blame disin-
terested corporations 
and white, wealthy com-
munities for disenfran-
chising the youth, peo-
ple of color and the 
poor, they fail to put themselves in the 
position of the ddughters who~e Dart-
mouth parents were brutally stabbed in 
Ihe head and chest by 16- and 17 -year-old 
boys. The)' forget the pain of the 
Columbille shootings. They forget to put 
themselves in the shoes of a parent whose 
S-year-old daughter was killed for her 
bike. They forget that a cri me is a crime, 
regardless of the offender's age. They for-
get that sometimes, the criminal justice 
system works harder for the criminal than 
the victim. 

Now. don't get me wrong. I do not 
believe that institlltionalization is a solu-
tion to America's social problems. I am a 
strong advocate of rehabilitation and sec-
ond chances. There has been many a time 
111 my life, as I'm sure there has been in 
everyone else's, that being given the sec-
ond chance has made the difference. But I 
do believe, however trite this may sound, 
that if you do an adult crime, you do adult 
time. Minors that commit certain serious 
crimes should be tried as adults. 

Violent, preventable crimes by minors 
have long plagued America's la rger cities 
but have scarcely been punished because 
of the age of the perpetrators. Protected by 
a lenient and highly outdated juvenile jus-
tice system , violent youth have taken 
advantage of such benefits and have run 
rampant in our cities. High profile slayings 
arc quite the norm on the evening news, 
and every once in a while, disaster strikes 
and we lose a large number of lives at the 
hands of young offenders. And sadly, na'ive 
America continues to lose more and more 
lives at the hands of reckless teens and 
repeat offcndcrs because we choose to give 
them as many chances as they need so 
long as they are not legal adults. Unfortu-
atdy, we have to lose and destroy more 

lives because we refuse to punish. 
Many juvenile court sentences have 

amounted to nothing but a mere slap on 
the wrist for many young offenders. The 
juvenile court is no longer capable of pro--
viding the individualized attent ion that it 

first sought out to do and 
can no longer easi ly help 
at-risk offenders who are 
threats even after their 
juvenile sentences. Laws 
were first created to han-
dle small cases such as 
truancy, shoplifting and 
vandalism. These laws are 
now archaic, as they do 
not have the ability 

to handle today's violent crimes. 
Tougher crimes call for tougher

No matter how heinous the crime, children are still children. 
and should go through rehabilitation programs 
By JACOB WASSERMAN 
Staff Writer 

Wednesday, July 5, 2000, somewhere 
in San Diego: Last night was the fireworks, 
and tonight you 're halfway between one 
weekend and the next, 

rocks. When you and your friends are done 
with this nursery worker lying by the side of 
the road under a Carmel Valley overpass, 
you go and find another. And another. And 
another. And another. 

You call them "beaners" as you deliver 
blow after blow. And you 

con 
do not think of your 
bright future that has 
slipped away like the sun 
over the horizon of 
McGonigle Canyon. 

and you're riding in a car 
with you .. friends, looking 
for a little excitement, and 
you're 14 years old, and 
you have most of the 
summer and most of your 
life stretched out ahead of 
you on the road. GUARDIAN OPINION 

But wait. This isn 't 
your story. Hopefully you 
don't know the sound 
made by a baseball bat It's that period of your 

life when 
time runs haywire; a 
whole month's plan-
ning goes into a single 

five-minute slow dance; a 
one-hour history test feels 
longer than the three days 

you spent studying. Tonight 
can't possibly last long 

enough. Everyone you are 
cruising with is a year or two 

older than you, and you are 
one of the gang, and this is a 
good time! 

And, in the blink of 
your adolescent mind's 
eye, you and your seven 
friends are viciously 
beating an old man. 
He is an immigrant, 
but maybe you 
don't know that as 
you bru ise his 
brown skin. You 
and your 
friends use 
baseball bats. 
And BB 
guns. And 

connecting with the flesh 
of a 60-year-old man. I don 't either, but 
Jason Beever and his friends might. Accord-
ing to the San Diego Police Department and 
other authorities, Beever and seven other 
boys are responsible for actions very similar 
to those described above. 

Beever, 14, is the youngest of the group. 
His companions are Michael A. Rose, lS; 
Morgan V Manduley, 15; Steven j. Deboer, 
17; Nicholas P. Fileccia, 16; Bradly H. David-
ofSky, 16; Kevin S. Williams, 15; and Adam 
M. Ketsdever, 16. Some of these children 
may have been unwilling participants. Some 
of these children may have hidden in the car 
while others attacked five Latino men, 
whose ages range from Sl to 69. Some of 
these children may have used BB guns to 
shoot their victims point blank, in the face. 
All of them stand accused of assault and hate 
crimes. None has been found guilty yet. 

VVednesday,Feb. 7,2001 , so~ewherein 
San Diego: Seven months ago a horrible 
series of actions turned your son's life into a 
nightmare, and this morning you hold your 
breath and pray for the California Court of 
Appeals to make the right decision, to help 
you undo a mistake that you and millions of 
other Californians made almost a year ago. 

You bitterly regret the vote you cast last 
March for Proposition 21, the Juvenile 

Crime Initiative. You understand 
now that it is a bad law, a mon-

strous and - you hope - an 
unconstitutional law, one 

that threatens your 
son with a maxi-
mum prison sen-
tence equal to 
his 15 years of 

age. This possibiliry

Ceres Would Not Be Happy 
Stop 
That! 

BERTRAND FAN 

I tried finding something to eat for breakfast today, and I discovered that rn.y newest 
cereal is an Apple Jacks trial size 
they sent in the mail last year. 
Someone had opened it and let it 
go soft. Now that I think about it, 
I don't think I've ever actually 
finished a box of cereal - it 
either goes soft or I get really sick 
of it. The worst are those huge 
three-packs of cereal at Price 
Club. You eat one box and then 
you say, "I really don 't like Frost-
ed Flakes any more. I thought I 
did, but now I don't." 

Another thing they have at' 
Price CI ub are those variety 
packs of cereal, but then some-
one ends up eating all the good 
-ones, and you wake up one day, 
and you're deciding between 
Special K and Cheerios. I tried 
Glape Nuts once because the 
people eating Grape Nuts on the 
commercials seemed to be hav-
ing a good time, and then I dis-
covered that Grape Nuts has no 
grape flavor and contains no 
nuts. I seriously should consult 
my lawyer about that. It was basi-
cally just a bunch of wheat health 
crap; it tasted horrible. [ wouldn't 
eat another bowl of that if you 
paid me. 

Ever notice how some people 
don't quite grasp the concept of 
putting cereal in milk? You go to 
their house and all they do is eat 
dry cereal and watch Jerry 

Springer. "You want to go see a 
movie?" "Shh, It's 'My Girlfriend 
is a Demonic Star Wars Freak' 
Return Visit . Have some Golden 
Grahams." 

My favorite is those people 
that are convinced that their 
cereal is good for them: "I eat 
Wheaties. One day I'll be able to 
get into a fjght and come out 
alive!" One glance at the ingredi-
ents would tell them that a bowl 
fulfills 80 percent of their daily 
intake of sugar. Take Honey 
Bunches of Oats, for example. 
Someone with an IQ under 7S 
might mistakenly believe that it 
has some nutritional value. I 
mean, it tastes pretty good, but 
I'm not under some delusion 
that it's any better than Sugar 
Coated Sugar Cubes. 

One cereal I really liked was 
this one with little ice cream 
cones. There were actually Iinle ice 
cream cones with artificial vanilla-
flavored ice cream on top. You 
could only find it at Pic-N-Save 
though, because the FDA proba-
bly pulled it out of the' market a 
week after it came out. I don't 
remember what it was called, but it 
probably had "Product of Mexico' 
stamped all over the box. 

If you're ever eating Cookie 
Crisp and you find four or five of 
those things melted together, don't 
eat it. I've had very bad experiences 
with masses of Cookie Crisp. 
Cookie Crisp is also a very expen-
sive cereal. It's something like S4 
for a box. But if I was r.own at 
Fedco or wherever it is where they 
have the generic cereals, I'd still get 
it over "Cookie-Like Bits." It's 
hilarious - they have Cheerios 
right next to "Oat Loops', and you 
know some stupid parent is gonna 

buy "Oat Loops" to save $3, bring 
it home, and the kid's gonna say, 
"Where's the Cheerios? What the 
hell is this crap? I want Cheerios!" 

I never realized how much the 
cereal companies were ripping 
me off with the prizes until I was 
about 17. I remember I'd go 
down the cereal aisle choosing 
which prizes I wanted. The cere-
al didn 't matter; I wasn't going to 
eat half of it anyway. Then we'd 
get home and I'd open up the box 
and dig for the prize. It was 
always at the very bottom and 
you got all these crumbs all over 
your hand while you were dig-
ging for it. Wow! A Secret 
Decoder Ring! 

That's why I don't understand 
how Kix survived. They actually 
advertise that they don't have a 
prize. That's almost as stupid as 
those Sprite commercials. Sprite 
commercials make fun of all the 
techniques that their parent 
company, Coca-Cola, uses. Imag-
ine if they ran both ads in a row. 

The biggest rip-off I can 
remember was the time Wheaties 
had a $1,000,000 contest. Buying 
Wheaties was like buying a lottery 
ticket. And we wonder why Amer-
ica has a gambling addiction. 

Another thing I don 't like 
about cereal is how soggy it 
gets. By the time you finish 
pouring the milk, half the cereal 
in it can no longer be classified 
as crispy. Even Chex gets soggy. 
I distinctly remember leaving a 
bowl of Chex for about two 
minutes and coming back very 
disappointed. And what's with 
those people who add sugar to 
their cereal? That's like adding

Editor: 
It is both shocking and alarming. 

for any fair-minded student to read 
amid the pages of our university 
newspaper, the Guardian, the 
extremely offensive sort of condem-
nations that are more akin to rabid, 
journalistic McCarthyism than the 
articulate arguments that mark 
quality collegiate newspapers 
throughout the United States. 

It seems that Ms. Baharian and 
Mr. Wikner - for what appears to 
be a lack of something to write -
must turn to pillorying the U.S. 
president to fill their columns. It 
would appear to the reader that 
both writers accrue to the 
"tabloid" school of journalistic 
thought ... concerned more with 

the entertai nment of readers than 
co nveya nce of meaningful 
thought and discussion . I speak 
now of their articles concerning 
Presiden t George W. Bush on Feb. 
20,2001 . 

Briefly, Baharian condemns 
Bush for speaking at the infamous 
Bob Jones University (an institu-
tion widely known for its discrimi-
natory policy on interracial dating). 
and Wikner (apparently never hav-
ing studied Bush's resume) pillories 
him as incompetent, decrying his 
lack of oratorical ski ll s. 

I would like to address Wikn-
er's arguments first. Wikner seems 
to believe that simple oratorical 
skills are synonymous with com-
petence, and because the presi-
dent is not as gifted a speaker as 
his predecessor, his political com-
petence is brought into question. 
To this, I might direct Wikner to a 
rather good book, " I, Cladius," 
written by Robert Graves, which 
describes a far worse speaker than 
Bush (Claudius Caeser) who -
despite a speech impediment -
rose to become one of the greatest 
emperors of Rome. 

Wikner seems to neglect the 
fact that Bush held a gubernatorial 
role in the United States ... gover-
nor of the state of Texas, that he 
was a graduate of Yale University 
and is an officer and a pilot of the 
Air National Guard. Wikner seems 
to base his entire argument upon 
rather vague incidents of slips of 
the tongue. 

Now turning to Baharian's arti -
cle, which describes Bush's speech 
at Bob Jones University. To her 
credit, Baharian presents far more 
research than Wikner, but with far 
less substance. 

Her statement that "i t is clear

Kids slwuld face up to 
their crimes 
continued frOlll ..... 4 
way Ollt. Some youths are even 
known to commit crimes with -
out thought because they know 
they cannot be tried as adults. 
Eventually, many young offend-
ers who go through juvenile sys-
tems do not end up rehabilitated 
and , as a result, turn back to 
crime. In many jurisdictions, a 
child may have to commit 10 to 
15 serious crimes before any-
thing is actua lly done to him. 

Children are killed by chil-
dren . Teens are killed by teens. 
And still we refuse to punish 
them because "they are too young 
to understand that what they are 
doing is wrong." An excuse most 
heard from parents, it is also an ' 
excuse too often heard after lives 
are lost and ruined. Without a 
tougher punishment system, 
society is left with a high percent-
age of delinquents and a rising 
percentage of crime victims. 

For many victims, the juvenile 
COllrt systems have been a far cry 
from justice. Families of murder 
victims, rape targets and victims 
of other serious crimes have been 
left abandoned without a sense of 
closure, a sense of protection. 
Some feel like their loss was left 
unacknowledged. Indeed, in such 
a leniant juvenile system, victims 
are more often than not left unac-
knowledged . Most people agree 
with Sterling Burnett of the 
National Center for Policy Analy-
sis in Dallas: "The only way to 
treat the victim as a full human 
beillg - I fully hon r the mem-
ory of the victim - is to punish 
the perpetrator .. 00 " 

Trying minors as adults will 

toughen the system and hold 
someone responsible. Minors 
must be fully culpable for thei r 
behavior if we are to deter future 
delinquents from committing 
violent crimes. Setting this 
example and making it known 
that our cities will , indeed, be 
tough on crimes, will serve as a 
wake-up call. Like the three 
strikes law, the threat of a harsh 
sentence will most certainly 
make children think twice 
before they commit violent 
crimes. 

Since 1993, at least 43 states 
have passed laws making it easier 
for children to be tried as adults. 
A juvenile justice bill is currently 
awaiting final Congressional 
approval and contains similar 
measures for the federal system. 
Proposition 21, from last year's 
California elections, was passed 
and, although it has stirred much 
opposition and controversy, it 
has molded the image that soci-
ety will have no tolerance for 
crime. The cost of implementing 
such measures will never even 
reach the immeasurable cost of 
lives lost. 

In the words of former Cali-
fornia Gov. Pete Wilson, we have 
to act "decisively to retake [ourl 
neighborhoods .... " If we are to 
sincerely make an effort to keep 
our cities safer, all of America 
has to understand that youth 
may not be adults, but they are 
certainly capable of committing 
crimes. The crime that a 16-
year-old commits is no different 
than that of a 60-year-old -
thus, there should be no reason 
to treat them differently. Second 
chances will come accordi ngly, 
but accountability should come 
first. It is not abollt giving chil-
dren second chances. It is about 
making them responsible for 
their actions.

fills you with dread. You know the 
terrible reality your son may face in 
an adult prison. When he gets out, 
if he gets out, he will be older than 
you were when he was born. 

If the statistics provided by Jef-
frey Fagan et al. on the American 
Civil Liberties Union Web site 
hold true, your son will be 40 per-
cent more likely to be rearrested 
than if he had been sentenced to 
the juvenile justice system. While 
behind bars, his chances of being 
attacked with a weapon will go up 
by 50 percent. His chances of 
being beaten by staff will increase 
by 200 percent. The odds that 
your son will suffer a sexual 
assault will rise 500 percent. 

But wait. This isn't your story 
either. You don't recall any earth-
shattering decisions made two-
and-a-half weeks ago. Neither do I. 
[t was Debra Manduley, mother of 
Morgan Manduley, who had cause 
to gasp with relief when the court 
ruled against Proposition 21. 

The appellate court found that 
prosecutors should not decide 
when to treat a child as an adult. 
That decision belongs to the 
impartial judicial branch, not the 
district attorneys, whose job nec-
essarily makes them biased. 
Proposition 21 still allows stiffer 
penalties for petty vandalism, 
broad police discretion to treat 
children as gang members, and 
other potentially abusive practices. 

Wednesday, Feb. 21, 2001, 
somewhere in La Jolla: You 
begin research for an article 
against sentencing ch ildren as 
adu lts. You find the latest devel-
opment close to home. You read 

articles from the Union-Tribune 
and The North County TImes. You 
are appalled ·as the ugly details of 
the crime unfold. And yet you 
agree with Linda Hills, the execu-
tive director of the San Diego 
ACLU, who stated, "Hate crimes 
shduld certainly be vigorously 
prosecuted and all possible steps 
should be taken to prevent them, 
but the constitutional rights of 
the accused minors should not be 
trampled in the process: . 

But again, this is not your 
story. This is my story. I am the 
one who writes articles like this 
one to help pay the rent. I am 
the one infuriated by the fact 
that more of my hard-earned tax 
dollars go to prisons than to 
higher education. I am the one 
who is scared that some of the 
inner-city children I helped 
learn to read may be jailed for 
life before they have a chance to 
graduate. I am the one who 
prays for the overturning of the 
rest of Proposition 21. I am the 
one who fears our society's dra-
conian willingness to ignore 
human reality and abrogate 
human rights in its blind search 
for simple, comfortable answers. 

Whenever you read this, 
whcrner you arc: You hold this 
newspaper in your hand and you 
read this sentence and you try to 
figure out what you are supposed 
to take away from this article. You 
aren't sure you understand what all 
the words mean. You are sure you 
don't understand what all the facts 
mean, or even what they are. You 
think of a brittle old man bleeding 
on the roadside and you want pun-
ishment, vengeance, justice. You 
think of a skinny little boy being 
raped in a concrete cell and you 
want protection, safety, mercy. You 
don't think these things at all , you 
think something entirely different, 
you don't know what to think.

The award for worst cereal of

Don't get me wrong - Bite-Sized 
Frosted Shreaded Wheat is great 
- but Shredded Wheat alone is 
the stupidest cereal I've ever seen. 
How can you expect people to 
break it into spoon-sized pieces? 
You know some kid is jus~ going to 
break it in half and choke trying to 
swallow one of those things. It's 
just a lawsuit waiting to happen. 
Maybe all of their sales are based 
on elementary schools dying it 
green and making it into really 
cheesy Christmas tree ornaments. 

Cap'n Crunch sticks to your 
mouth after eating e'nough of it. 
The Crunch berries taste really 
artificial after a certain period of 
time and you start to wonder 
what's really in them. 

Then there's Raisin Bran. [f you 
live in any normal household, by 
the time you get to the Raisin Bran, 
someone has painstakingly taken 
out all of the Raisins and you're left 
with crappy bran. 

Cocoa Pebbles are pretty good, 
but after a while you look at your

thinking about all the Cocoa Peb-
bles commercials and for all inten-
sive purposes, when Fred and Bar-
ney are in the jungle, it is mud. 
You're drinking mud. That's why [ 
don't eat Cocoa Pebbles, or any 
cocoa product for that matter. 

[s there anyone who actually 
eats the complete breakfast they 
always show on the box? On the 
box, they have eggs and toast and a 
tall glass of milk. [f they're going to 
be unrealistic, why don't they just 
put onion soup and escargot and a 
glass of wine? That would look a 
whole lot better. 

They could seriously brain-
wash you on the back of those 
cereal boxes. What do you do 
when you're eating cereal? What 
can you do? [ always end up read-
ing the back and the sides of the 
cereal box because I'in too lazy to 
go find a paperback. [ can proba-
bly recite the nutrition facts for 
most Post products. 

I think the real problem is that I 
rarely eat breakfast any more. Or, [ 
couldn't really consider what [ eat 
to be breakfast. [ dun no, what's a 
bowl of cereal; a bagel, a pack of 
fruit gushers and corned beef 
brisket at 6 p.m.? That's about as 
close to breakfast as the carne 
asada at Cotixan is to actual meat 
for human consumption.

Partying Like It's 1999: 
No Recession in Vegas 

LAS VEGAS - [t can get very 
crowded here with people spending 
money as if they were all rich. 

The walkway connecting Bellagio 
and Caesars Palace, two of the fanci-
est casino resorts, got so jammed on 
Saturday night that at one point 

• everyone had to stop and wait. The 
mall at the Venetian, which has the 
same stores found in many upscale 
malls, was as full as any shopping 
center could hope to be on 
Christmas Eve. The Paris, the 
Aladdin, Bally's, the Strip: all packed. 

[f the economy is flattening out 
and Americans dre cutting back, 
you would never know it from vis-
iting the easiest place in the coun-
try to publicly throwaway cash. 

A week of bad economic news -
inflauon increasing at the fastest 
pace in 10 months, the price of nat-
ural gas posting its sharpest record-
ed increase ever, economists sound-
ing alarm bells about sagging con-
sumer confidence - did little to 
deflate the exuberance of the tourists 
who flock to Las Vegas. Men tossed 
$100 bills at the craps tables at 
Bellagio, lost it all in one bad roll of 
the dice and laughed. The restau-
rants, the cafes and the buffets had 
long Iitles and long waits. 

On the weekend before 
President Bush's address on his 
budget and his tax proposal to 
Congress, many tourists here, no 
matter where they were from, said 

they were unsure about the need 
for tax cuts and supported Bush's 
plan, if they supported it at all, only 
if the cuts were limited. Few cared 
to discuss the president's proposal 
to repeal the estate tax" And when 
asked what they thought of the 
sinking economy, most people said 
the economy was not sinking at all. 

"I see a lot of people here and 
they all seem to be spending money 
and having a good time: said 

.Marie Bruno, while a bride and 
groom, a family of six and a bus-
road of tourists passed her slot 
machine at Caesars. . 

"I'm not winning, I'm spend-
ing," she said in a New York accent 
that 10 years in Fort Lauderdale, 
Fla., had not changed. "But I have a 
great time here. I'm not worried. 
The economy is in great shape. The 
stock market is the only bad thing, 
and that'll bounce back: 

Most people interviewed here' 
said the same. Richard Smucker of 
Medina, Ohio, the president and 
chief executive of the jam and jelly 
company that bears his name, was 
attending a conference for chain 
restaurants and their suppliers. He 
said he was sure that the recent

Department will begin two days of 
oral arguments before seven 
judges of the U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals for the District of 
Columbia in a case of historic 
dimensions for consumers, the 
computer industry and the law.

c.wtIRcsed "... ..... 1 
zone that has divided the penin-
sula since the Korean War. 

"Putin's desire is to reintro-
duce Russia into the scene." said 
Robert Scalapino, a professor at 
the University of California at 
Berkeley and an expert on the 
region. 

Andrei Osmakov, an official at 
the Russian Embassy here, said, 
"We need stability on the Korean 
peninsula because the Korean 
peninsula is a neighbor of Russia. 
If you look at the history of Russia 
and Korea, we had good relations 

to the law of an titrust," said 
Kenneth W. Starr, th e former 
Whitewater independent counsel 
who has filed a brief supporting 
the breakup of Microsoft. 

Last year, U.S. District Judge 
Thomas Penfield Jackson order-
ed Microsoft to be split into two 
companies after finding that it had 
repeatedly bullied rivals and vio-
lated the Sherman Antitrust Act. 
Microsoft has countered that 
Jackson committed a raft of pro-
cedural and substantive errors 
and that he was biased against it. 

Microsoft's lawyers are hoping 
for a big win in the appeals court, 
forcing the new leadership at the 
Justice Department and 19 state 

between czarist Russia and Korea 
in the 19th century." 

Against that background, 
President Kim Dae-jung's efforts at 
reconciliation with the North are 
expected to be a major topic. Putin 
is also expected to stress h is oppo-
sition to the American plan for a 
national missile defense. A danger 
from North Korea has been cited 
by Americans to explain why such 
a system is needed. 

The prospect of discussion of a 
tradeoff reflecting the policy aims 
of both leaders means the meeting 
is likely to be far more pointed 
than was the last South Korean-
Russian summit meeting, in May 
1999, when Kim saw Yeltsin in 
Moscow. 

• Previously, Korea thought 
Russia could be a negotiator with 

attorneys general to a beat hasty 
retreat or accept a settlement less 
painful for the company. Bush 
administration officials have 
decided to awai t the decision 
before returning to the bargaining 
table. 

A central issue in the argu-
ments will almost certainly be 
whether many conclusions by 
Jackson - like one that Microsoft 
is a monopolist that improperly 
exercised its market power - are 
conclusions of law that can be eas-
ily reversed, or conclusions of fact 
that must be accorded deference.

North Korea" but those expecta-
tions have not been rea lized, said 
Kim Duk-joo, a specialist in 
Russian affairs at the Institute of 
Foreign Affairs and National 
Security. "The Russians should 
participate in a dialogue on peace-
ful coexistence." 

But the Russian need for trade 
and investment is also expected to 
be high on Putin 's agenda. espe-
cially the development of natural 
gas in Irkutsk, with Moscow pro-
moting a pipeline through North 
Korea to South Korea, and a 
Russian proposal to rebuild the 
rail network that once connected 
the Russian Far East to ports in 
the South.

EATU 

Indian casinos are a 
viable alternative to 
Las Vegas for many 

UCSD studentS 

or people who constantly 

F get that itch for games of chance, Las Vegas has always been the ultimate 
land of opportunity. There 

isn't anywhere else in the world 
where somebody can find so many 
different places to gamble or so 
many different ways to gamble. In 
recent years, Las Vegas has become 
even more alluring after the building 
of such world-class resorts as 
Bellagio and the Venetian. 

Unfortunately for UCSD stu-
dents, Las Vegas js rarely a reason-
able option for quenching their gam-
bling fantasies. The five-hour drive 
puts a crimp into everybody's style, 
especially with gas prices as high as 
they are right now. 

Also, more then half of UCSD's 
population is under 21 . FQr this 
group, Las Vegas seems more like a 
dollar peep show downtown; they let 
you look but not touch. 

Well my friends, there is a way to 
stay local and still find a way to lose 
your money in a blaze of glory: the 
Native American reservation casinos. 

1IIeL8w 
Prior to 1988, Native American 

tribes were prohibited from having 
gaming establishments on their 
reservations. This all changed that 
year, however, when federal law 
granted Native Americans this right. 

The federal rights provided, how-
ever, were very limited. The law 
would not allow the casinos to pro-
vide money for card games. Players 
had to offer an ante to the house and 
could only bet against each other, 
meaning the dealers could not play 
hands. The law also did not allow 
lotteries. Low limits on slot 
machines were also enforced. 

For these reasons, the reserva-
tions were forced to innovate some 
games that were strikingly similar to 
the Las Vegas classics, but they could 
not offer the actual games. 

This problem looked like it ~as 
to be settled in 1 998 after the over-
whelming passing of Proposition 5, 
which aimed to clear up the word-
ing in the original federal law and

By JOSH CROUSE 
Features Editor 

I've peaked too early. 
There's no other way to really 

describe it. I'm in college and par-
ties are raging every weekend 
(maybe not here at UCSD, but we 
do live in San Diego), but alii feel 
like doing on a Saturday night is 
sitting at home with some friends. 

I know that this concept must 
be foreign to many UCSD stu-
dents who have been starved of 
parties throughout their high 
school careers (and probably 
throughout college as well), but 
trust me, you 'll all get there some-
day. 

Many of you are probably sit-
ting there right now and speculat-
ing about my past. You might be 
guess ing that I'm a fifth-year 
senior who has seen his share of 
parties, or perhaps an SDSU 
transfer student. Well, I'm neither. 
In fact, I'm a second-year Warren 
studen t who could probably 
count the number of parties he's 
gone to here at UCSD on his two 
hands. 

Now that I've thoroughly con-
fused the hell out of all of you, let 
me explain . 

I went to high school in a small 
Northern California town. It was 
hell for an adventurous youth like 
me. Weekend activities were nar-
rowed to bowling, miniature golf, 
roller skating, laser tag or the mall. 
While these activities were 
enough to keep me busy in my 
younger days, I soon grew bored 
of them when I entered high

opportuni ties Native Americans 
were allowed to offer in their casi-

An Active High School 
Party Life Can 'Lead to 
Apathy in College 

school, as did the rest of the kids 
in town . 

We quickly learned that the 
various fields and orchards that 
filled our quiet little town were 
great for concealing parties. It 
wasn't long before we were drink-
ing almo§t every weekend . 
Occasionally, somebody's parents 
would go out of town and we 
would have a house party, but we 
remained content in the orchards 
for the most part. 

As we got older, the parties 

Since it was a college that 
was basically in the 
middle of nowhere, there 
was nothing for those 
poor students to do on the 
weekends other than 
party, and party they did,' 
intensified and grew. The week-
ends melded together into a single 
memory of friends, women and 
free-flowing alcohol. We were 
thoroughly enjoying our high 
school years. 

When we became juniors in 
high school, we made one of the 
greatest discoveries of our young 
lives. We found the Greek system. 

Situated in our small town was 
California State University, 
Stanislaus. This wonderful college 
had been home to many a football 
or basketball game in our youth, 
but it had never crossed our 
minds that it was also home to 

opportunity to ftx the squabbling 
between the government and 
Native Americans in March 2000. 
Appearing on this ballot was 
Proposition lA, which claimed to 
fix the confusing wording in the 
state law. 

When the smoke cleared on 
March 8, the tally wasn 't even a 
close one. A whopping 64.6 per-
cent of voters were for 1 A. 

The effect of Proposition 1 A 
was not clear at the time it was 
passed, but in retrospect, it is easy 
to see the differences in the Native 
American casinos. 

First of all, the limit on slot 
machines has been raised to 
$2,000. For this reason, many of 
the local casinos are adding new 

some of the greatest parties 
known to man. 

Since it was a college that was 
basically in the middle of 
nowhere, there was nothing for 
those poor students to do on the 
weekends other than party, and 
party they did. 

We would have probably 
remained oblivious to these parties 
had we not been friends with (and 
partied constantly with) older peo-
ple who graduated from high 
school and went on to ·study" at 
CSUS (it was very common for stu-
dents from our high school to stay 
in town and go to college there). 

As they filtered into the col-
lege, they embraced the Greek 
system as something to keep them 
sane during the long hours of 
boredom that the town had to 
offer. The result was our first con-
nections to college parties. 

At first we were a bit cautious 
as we entered the new plateau of 
parties. We were used to hiding in 
orchards while we drank on week-
ends. Now we were in houses 
filled with people, loud music and, 
most importantly, alcohol. 

The first few fraternity parties 
that we went to were very awk-
ward. We were the youngest ones 
there and only knew a few peoplo. 

We spent the first few hours of 
the first party just sitting on the 
couch and sipping our beers. 
People would occasionally come 
and talk to us, but we remained 
shell-shocked and speechless for 
the most part.

Proposition 1 A also allows 
Native Americans to play house-

The effect Of Proposition 
1 A was not clear at the 
time it was passed, but in 
retrospect, it is easy to see 
the differences in the 
Native American casinos, 
banked games like blackjack and 
run lottery-type games. All in all, 
Proposition lA made the reserva-
tion casinos much more like' those 
of Las Vegas.

as to which games they offer, the 
variation is quite small. Most of 
the favorites from Las Vegas are 
offered at all the casinos, and 
some offer the more obscure 
games. 

this game when they were little kids 
and it doesn't really need much 
explaining. They call a number and 
if you have it -on your card, you 
mark it. The first person to get a 
straiglu line of called numbers 
wins. There are a few variations on 
this, but that is the basic game. So 
if you are over 70, you should be 
very happy with YOu[ bingo options 
around San Diego: 

The reservation casinos all offer 
a wide variety of slot machines for 
your playing enjoyment. These 
machines, thanks to Proposition 
lA, are now the same types of 
machines found in Las Vegas. If 
you like slot machines, any of the 
casinos in the area should be to 
your liking. 

All of the local casinos also offer 
the old favorite of the gerontology 
crowd: bingo. Everybody played 

Blackjack is also offered at all of 
the San Diego area casinos. 
Blackjack is a game in which the

cards. The players play solely

Arlee (March 21-April19) 
Workmates or daily compan-

ions may now need to publicly dis-
cuss recent events, policies or 
group projects. This is an excellent 
time to establish a bond with close 
collea&ues and review common 
interests. Some Aries natives may 
also be asked to solve a difficult 
calculation or scheduling problem. 
If so, Aries should go slow: The 
next few weeks may bring unex-
p:ctect reversals and fast reassign-
ments. After Thursday, a past 
romantic attraction will be revital-
ized: Watch for subtle and seduc-
tive invitations. 

, ..... (April2D-May 20) 
Daily routines may be disrupted 

early this week, Taurus. You should 
expect a colleague or close friend to 

suddenly change his or her 
approach to ongoing projects or 
duties. Key areas involved may be 
compiled information, research, 
financial paperwork or recQrds. 
Some Taureans, especially those 
born prior to 1954, may also expe-
rience new money decisions or 
debts: Go slow and watch for hid-
den clauses. Later this week older 
relatives or roommates may be 
moody and distant: Expect minor 
home tensions. 

...... (May 21-June 21) 
Official duties, time schedules 

and project instructions will now 
intensify. Over the next few days, 
expect team dynamics and social 
outlets to work in your favor. For 
many Geminis, this is a time when 
others will offer highly creative 
ideas and worthwhile solutions. Be 
optimistic, Gem, but also expect 
miscalculations or ongoing time 
restrictions. After Wednesday, new 
messages and quick decisions will 
change a key friendship: Social ver-
sus romantic priorities may require 
added discussion. 

c:.cer (June 22·July 22) 
After a period of social disagree-

ments and competing jealousies, 
many Cancerians will now find sta-
bility in key relationships. Before 
March 24, expect negative sociai 
influences, misinformation or over-
ly sensitive friends to change their 
attitude. Ongoing criticism and

daily restrlcttons will now fade: 
Watch for loved ones to be expres-
sive and passionate. After 
Thursday, money promises will 
change. For the next three weeks, 
authority figures will be cautious, 
Cancer: Remain patient. 

Leo (July 23-Aug~ 22) 
Romance and long-term friend-

ship are accented this week, Leo. 
Over the next few days many Leos 
will begin an intense period of 
emotional growth in close relation-
ships. Long-standing issues of 
romantic reluctance or divided pri-
orities will now slowly be solved, 
Leo. Expect loved ones to express a 
new awareness of freedom, seduc-
tive attraction and intimacy. Single 
Leos may now experience powerful 
and potentially disruptive flirta-
tions: Be selective and watch for 
rare social complications. 

VIrP (Aug. 23-Sept. 22) 
Social comfort, romantic 

belonging and shared goals will 
this week arrive in long-term rela-
tionships, Virgo. Loved ones will 
now rekindle their original feelings 
of attraction and romantic enjoy-
ment: Expect past memories and 
old sentiments to soon create a 
deepening trust. Single Virgos, over 
the next two weeks, can expect a 
slowly developing sensuality in a 
new relationship. Be receptive, 
Virgo, and explore fresh emotions: 
New commitments will bring

UIIIa (Sept. 23-Oct. 23) 
Over the next few days, Libra, 

your practical wisdom will offer 
solid rewards. Before midweek. 
watch for a close colleague or 
friend to introduce new informa-
tion, social contacts or key propos-
als. All are positive, Libra, and will 
soon lead to expanding optimism, 
fresh work options and renewed 
faith in long-term career goals. 
After Thursday, romantic commu-
nications may be difficult: Give 
friends or lovers extra time to settle 
family or home differences. 

ScorpIo (Oct. 24-Nov. 21) 
Dreams and emotional flashes 

will be a strong theme this week, 
Scorp: Late Tuesday, a brief but 
intense period of moody reflection 
will arrive. For many Scorpios, con-
templation and deep thought will 
now help clarify their. long-term 
needs and beliefs concerning key 
relationships. Romantic or social 
commitments may be more 
involved than previously anticipat-
ed: Before next week take extra 
time for informed, appropriate 
decisions. This will be an emotion-
ally demanding week, Scorp: Stay 
focused .

Early this week, Sage, your cre-

high. Over the next few days, watch 
loved ones closely for indications 
of change: Many Sagittarians will 
now greatly expand their emotion-
al commitments, social promises or 
daily home activities. Some 
Sagittarians will also experience 
improved work relations: Fading 
power struggles will be an impor-
tant issue. After Friday, artistic and 
social insight are accented: Enjoy 
sudden flashes of awareness and 
fast invitations from friends. 

CIIpIIcon (Dec. 22-Jan. 19) 
Before mid-week, Cap, a brief 

but intense period of reflection and 
inward thought arrives. Key issues 
may involve recent social events or 
new changes to long-term relation-
ships. For most Capricorns, this 
period of contemplation will be the 
precursor for two to three days of 
quick social changes or highly pub-
lic emotional discussions. After 
Thursday, expect lovers or long-
term friends to initiate new home 
ideas or romantic proposals. Be 
expressive, but sensitive, Cap: 
Loved ones are now vulnerable. 

Aquartu. (Jan. 2D-Feb. 18) 
The past fights back this week,

both lovers and close friends to

outdated concepts. Some

ca rds are worth 10, an ace is worth 
either one or 11 , and all other 
cards are worth thdr face va lue. 
The object is to get higher than 
the dea ler withcut going over 21. 
The wide allure of blackjack can 
probably be attributed to the fact 
that any novice can sit down and 
win , while there are advanced 
strategies that make the game 
interesting for even the most sea-
soned player. 

All of the San Diego area casi-
nos offer a poker room where 
pl ayers can match their wits 
against each other in classic card 
games such as seven-card stud 
and Texas hold 'em. Some, but 
not all , also have va riations of 
poker that you can play against 
the house. These games include 
Caribbean stud poker, three card 
poker, let it ride and pai gow 
poker. 

The ru les of these ga mes are 
toO kngthy to explain in text, but 
if you enjoy classic poker games, 
picklllg up the rules to these 
games shou ldn 't take you very 
long. 
The Casinos 

. Pechanga 
Pechanga is a Native American 

casino in Temecula. To get there, 
you take Interstate 15 north for 
about 40 miles, exit on highway 
79, turn right and go one mile to 
Pala Road, where you again turn

right. Stay on Pala Road for about 
2 miles and Pechanga is on the 
right. 

Pechanga offers blackjack, 
slots, bingo, Caribbean stud 
(which they call Pechanga stud, 
but the rules are the same) and 
classic poker. 

Barona 
Barona is settled right here in 

the San Diego area, but getting to 
it can be a challenge if you don 't 
know exactly where you are going. 

They don't have the 
same glitz and gLamour 
of the Las Vegas 
resorts, but they are a 
good substitute if you 
are in the mood to lose 
a little money at the 
tables or sitting behind 
a one-armed bandit, 
Take Interstate 8 east to Highway 
67 north. Exit on Willows Road, 
then take a left on Wildcat 
Canyon Road. If you follow that 
six miles through a winding 
mountain road, Barona will be on 
your left. 

Sarona offers all the games 
that Pechanga does, but also offers 
three card poker, pai gow poker 
and casino war (yes, it is basically 
the same game you played with 
your dad when you were five, only 
th is time it's for money). 

Viejas 
Viejas is possibly the easiest of 

all the area casinos to get to. You 

term friends set the tone th is 
week, Pisces: Before midweek , 
loved ones will strongly benefit 
from publicly expressing their 
views or helping plan group 
events. Expect others to now 
adopt a more active and outspo-
ken role in relationships: This is a 
positive time for displays of social 
co nfidence and romantic love. 
Later this week, a workplace set-
back may be bothersome: Watch 
for delayed records, misinforma-
tion and revised assignments to 
disrupt daily duties.

take 1-8 to Alpine and exit .on 
Willows Road. Thrn left and fol-
low the street a mile-and-a-half. 
The casino is on your left side. 
The Viejas outlet stores are on the 
right. 

Viejas has a similar set of 
games to Barona 's, but does not 
offer casino war. It does, however, 
offer let it ride and baccarat, two 
games that no other casino in the 
area offers. 

Sycuan 
Sycuan is geogaphically the 

closest casino to UCSD, but the 
drive takes about as long as the 
drive to Viejas. To get to Sycuan, 
go down 1-8 and exit at EI Cajon 
Boulevard. Follow this until you 
hit Washington, then turn right. 
Follow this for three miles until it 
becomes Dehesa . Stay on it for 
another five miles and it will take 
you right to the casino. 

SycwlIl offers a somewhat 
more limited selection of games as 
compared to the other casinos. In 
addition to the standard poker, 
slots and blackjack (which they 
call Sycuan 21), Sycuan offers pai 
gow poker and Sycuan stud 
(which, again, is simply a dressed 
up name for Caribbean stud) . 
A Good Alte,nMI.e 

So for those of you who don 't 
have the time to go to Las Vegas 
or -aren't 21 yet, check oUI the 
Native American reservation 
casinos. 

They don't have the sam.e 
glitz and glamour of the Las 
Vegas resorts, but they are a good 
substitute if you are in the mood 
to lose a little money at the tables 
or sitting behind a one-armed 
bandit. 

two to three months: Watch for 
several fresh introductions or a 
new circle of friends to arrive 
before the end of March . Many 
Pisceans will now gain powerful 
business alliances or rare future 
career opportunities through 
new social contacts. After mid-
Apri l, family restrictions and mis-
understandings with older rela-
tives will temporarily fade : Expect 
a five- to six-month period of 
approval and social acceptance 
from previously cautious loved 
ones. Romantic commitments 
will build slowly this year, Pisces: 
Don 't press for quick or final 
decisions before mid- to late 
September.

The proverbial ice finally broke 
during the second party when my 
friend asked me to mix some drinks 
for a few of the guys (this was a tal-
ent that I had aquired at a young 
age). After I whipped up some of 
the best drinks that these guys had 
ever tasted, we were accepted by 
pretty much all of the guys (and a 
lot of the girls as well , but that's a 
different story. 

We soon grew comfortable and 
were likewise embraced by the col-
lege party scene (it helps to hit the

and just enjoying the company of 
my friends. I'm not saying that I 
don't drink or wouldn 't go oUt to a 
party if I heard about a good one, 
but I'm no longer desperately seek-
ing one out every weekend. 

This attitude has crept into the 
rest of my 'life as well. 

Contrary to popular belief, I am 
not a player. Back in the day, that 
tit'le may have fit (but it would have 
been a stretch) . Granted, I can be 
very flirtatious, but that does not 
make me a player. 

As much as I hate to admit it , I'm 
not just looking for a girl to fool 
around with for a one-night stand 
(not any more~. I guess I'm just 
looking for something more sub-
stantial. I realize that right about 

beer bong a few 
times and gain 
credibility early on) . 

Our popularity 
around the high 
school inevitably 
skyrocketed, and we 
were soon the kings 
of the school. We 
began hosting our 
own parties at vari-
ous locations, draw-
ing large crowds on 
a regular basis. 

With our popu-
larity came added 
cockiness. We 
would start to take

day, that title may 
have fit (but it

does not make me a

now, there are 
probably a lot of 
guys out there call-
ing me a "pansy: . 
To that, I can just 
say · whatever." 

I n years past, 
being called names 
and challenging 
my ego like that 
would have proba-
bly made me go 
out and find the 
nearest good-look-

score, but I'm over

our illegal activities. We once tried 
to sneak alcohol into a movie the-
ater on the night that it opened. It 
might have worked if we weren't 
wearing huge jackets in 90 degree 
weather. Needless to say, we were 
busted and had to run from the 
cops to escape prosecution. 

Toward the end of my senior 
year, my house became party cen-
tral. Even after I left for college, I 
would be bothered by people to 
throw a party every time I came 
back to visit. It was almost expected. 

As one can imagine (or maybe 
you can't). this grew tiresome. The 
constant barrage of friends, women 
and alcohol was growing too much 
for me to handle. 

Some of my close friends felt my 
pain . We were getting burned out 
on the whole party scene. We would 
sometimes take weekends off and 
just drink and watch movies at a 
person 's house. "Goldeneye" 
became a great pastime and an 
escape from the party scene. 

That brings me to where I am 

I'm not saying that I'm ready to 
settle down and become a grandfa-
ther tomorrow - I'm sure I have a 
few parties left in me - but I am 
ready to calm down. 

It is unavoidable that we will all 
hit this point at some time in our 
lives. For some it will be in a few 
years. For some it will be in a few 
decades. 

For me, it's now.

mond this weekend. 

n Friday. Poin t Loma 
;'\'azarl'l1t:: University of the 
Nationdl Association of Intercolle-
giate Athletics took on UCSD. 
splitting a double header. 

Down 2-0 early in the first 
game. the Tritons stormed back in 
the bottom of the sewnth for the 
3-2 victory. Jeanine Cordero 
scored the winning run off an 
Amy ~ Ictee single. 

UCSD ace Lcca Harlan picked 
up th~ win . improving her record 
to 5-1 . Kim Aggabao had a hit and 
scored J run for the Tritons. 

In the second. it was all Cru-
saders as the Visitors won 6-1. 

Triton pi tcher Christi 
Martmelli picked up the loss. Har-
lan picked up the lone run for 
UCSD. 

On Saturday against Ca liforn irt 
State University San Bernardino. 
the Tri tons picked up two more 
wins in an exciting fashion. 

Lyon 

0uttII h .... : The Tritons, shown here at a game earlier this year, split a pair of games against Point LoTTUl Nzanme 
In the first game. the two 

schools were knotted at three 
heading into the seventh and final 
inning. With Aggabao on base. Tri-
ton catcher Kristin Hunstead 
drove her home for the 2-1 win. 

Harlan again was on the win-

ning end, striking out seven. 
Aggabao finished with two hits and 
a run scored.

Tennis: 
Match is as uneventful 
as they come 
ContI._"... ..... II 
rill. Moriarity looked to be running 
away with the match early and 
cruised to a 6-2 victory in the first 
set. The second set was much 
more interesting as Terrill man-
aged to knof the set at five and 
threatened to bring the match to a 
third and deciding set. Moriarity 
didn 't allow her to do this as she 
won the next two games and took 
the set 7-5. 

"I think we played very well 
considering we haven't had a 
match since the beginning of Feb-
ruary: LaPlante said. "Our oppo-
nents were not too strong so we 
didn't really have to play our best 
tennis to win, but overall I was 
pleased by how the team played ." 

This win brought the Tritons' 
record to 2-0 in the CCAA, but 
they haven't really been tested yet. 
The Tritons will find out what 
they are made of next week when 
they play Sonoma State University 
and UC Davis on the road. 

"We will really know how strong 
we are after this coming weekend 
against UC Davis and Sonoma 
State," LaPlante said. "Currently we 
are ranked No. 2 in the conference 
behind Davis." 

This weekend should be an 
interesting one for the Tritons.

in next Monday's edition of the

Tritons in position to 
win at half in both 
games but fall apart 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's basketball 
team again flirted with victory, but 
again the impeding "W" was 
replaced with a big old "L." 

Against California State Univer-
sity Dominguez Hills on Friday, the 
lhtons found themselves up 33-30 
at halftime. That was as good as it 
would get, as they were outscored 
in the second half 41-25 en route 
to losing 71-58. 

Sam Higgins was monstrous in 
the game, tallying 23 points. 

On Saturday against CSU Los 
Angeles, UCSD and CSULA were 
tied at 34 going into the break. The 
second half was a different story as 
UCSD was outscored 54-40, losing 
88-74. 

Nick Christensen scored 18 
points in the losing effort and Mar-
tin Michael chipped in with 15 . 

The two losses dropped 
UCSD's record to 3-22 overall and 
2-18 in California Collegiate Ath-
letic Conference play. 

UCSD wraps up its season at 
home this weekend. Cal State San 
Bernardino comes to town on Fri-
day for a gamcat 6 p.m. and Cal 
Poly Pomona pays a visit on Satur-
day for a game at 8 p.m.

No Problems for Men's Tennis 
Redlands proves little of a threat as Tritons beat old rivals, 6-1 
IIJIIlL ...... 
Senior Staff Writer 

The men's tennis team finally 
had to escape from San Diego to 
playa match this weekend. This 
was to be a big weekend for the 
Thtons, who were scheduled to 
play three matches in two days. 

That did not happen, however, 
as the two matches scheduled for 
Friday, one against Brandeis Uni-
versity ar:td one against Western 
New Mexico University, were 
rained out. All was not lost, 
though; there was still the match 
against old rival Redlands Univer-

-sity Saturday. 
The match had to be played in 

Palm Desert because of rain. The 
Tritons were glad, because they 
beat Redlands 6-1 for their first 
victory over the Bulldogs in over 
five years. 

Things didn't look good for 
the Tritons early in the match. 
Right after arriving in Palm 

_ Desert, they began playing dou-
bles and all three teams fell down 

- early. 

8-6. The duo of Cory Moderhak 
and Amir Nejad did not fare so 
well. After getting down early, the 
team found a bit of a groove but 
was unable to make it last, as they 
eventually fell 6-8. 

By winning two of the three 
doubles prosets, the Tritons cap-
tured the doubles point. This 
seemed imperative in order to win 
at the time, as a close match was 
expected. 

As it turned out, the Tritons 

"This was a good win 
for our team. I thought 
it would be close. If you 
haven't beaten a team in 
two years, you don It 
expect to go in and crush 
them, and that is pretty 
much what we did, II

Men 's tennis coach 

"We basically didn't play very 
well in doubles: said head coach would get more than enough in

out on the courts immediately At No. 1 singles, Chopra 
after a long drive, and I think that made a mockery of Steve Mash-
hurt us. We had to come back at burn of the Bulldogs, winning 2-
-one and two [doubles) to win the 6, 0-6. Chopra has stepped in 
point: nicely this year after sitting out 

That is exactly what the Tritons last season because of academic 
did . The No. 1 doubles team of ineligibility. 
Sameer Chopra and Dan Albrecht Meyer also had little problems 
fought through early adversity to in his match, winning 6-3, 6-1 at 
win its match by the narrow score No. 2 singles. Meyer and Chopra 
of 9-7. expect to switch off at the No. 1

and Jeff Wilson went through sim- ' 1'lie match at No. 3 was the 
ilar froubles but found their stride closest one of the day, and also the 
quickly enough to win the match only singles match the Tritons 

lost. Moderhak won the first set 
easily by a score of 6-2, but then 
lost the second 3-6. 

The third set went back and 
forth and was tied at five before 
Rob Condiolty of Redlands won 
the next two games and the set 7-
5. 

Wilson demolished his oppo-
nent, 6-1, 6-1 at No.4 singles, and 
Albrecht and Everett Schroeter 
both won by scores of 7-5,6-3 at 
No. 5 and No. 6 singles respec-
tively. 

"This was a good win for . our 
team: Steidlmayer said. "I 
thought it would be close. If you 
haven't beaten a team in two 
years, you don't expect to go in 
and crush them, and that is pretty 
much what we did." 

Steidlmayer was also happy 
with the participation of his play-
ers who weren't playing in the 
match. 

"This was a total team effort: 
Steidl mayer said. "We had every-
one there, even the red shirts. I 
know that that played a part in our 
victory." 

Next up for the Tritons is the 
Pacific Coast Doubles Champi-
onships right here in La Jolla . 

This match should be quite a 
challenge for the Tritons, as they 
will be facing players from schools 
such as the University of South-
ern California and UCLA. 

"This should be a good com-
petition for our guys: Steidlmayer 
said. ·We will be playing some of 
the toughest Division I competi-
tion in the nation." 

The Tritons don't play at home 
again until Saturday, March 10 
when they take on Boston Col-
lege. Good luck on the road, 
UCSD. 

Volley: 
Team has strong win 
after early rough times 
Con ....... froIn ..... 11 
Slugs who seized the momentum 
with three straight points to take 
the lead 3-1 . Santa Cruz was able 
to hold the lead until the Tritons 
finally battled back to tie the game 
at 7-7. But the Slugs again took 
the lead off a kill by their sopho-
more outside hitter Tom Moffett 
and stayed ahead of UCSD until a 
Hite kill once again tied thr game 
at 13-13. 

After a Santa Cruz kill, 
UCSD's Chen evened the score, 
and then the Tritons took their 
first lead since the beginning of 
the set on a Slug service error. 
After another kill by Chen and a 
kill by UCSC made the score 16-
15 in favor of UCSD, the Tritons 
tore the game wide open by 
smacking four points in a row, 
earning three off Santa Cruz 
errors. 

The other point came off a kill 
by sophomore Eric Perrine and 
especially hurt UCSC, as they bat-
tled against UCSD in a lengthy 
rally, but came up short in the 
end. The Slugs would battle, but 
four more errors did them in as a 
kill by Hove put them out of their 
misery, 30-23. 

The third game again began 
with a UCSD kill, this time by 

SPORTS 15 

Chen. The Tritons wasted no time 
jumping in front of the Banana 
Slugs, as Chen's second kill of the 
game put UCSD up 4-2 . After 
Santa Cruz came back to tie the 
game, a Hove kill and two UCSC 
errors put the score at 8-5 in 
favor of the Tritons. After a UCSC 
kill, the Tritons responded by 
putting up five straight points, 
including a long save by Chen 
that Perrine finished to twist the 
dagger into the heart of the Santa 
Cruz squad. 

That would be all for the 
Banana Slugs as they twice bat-
tled to pull within three points of 
UCSD, but it would all be for 
naught as the Tritons closed out 
the game and match, fittingly 
enough, on a Santa Cruz error to 
win 30-23 . 

UCSD's offense was particu-
larly impressive, as it banged out a 
0.355 hitting percentage, includ-
ing a 0.536 percentage in the first 
game. 

Chen had led the way with 14 
kills on the night for the Tritons, 
while both Cogorno and Hite 
were also in double figures, with 
13 and 10 kills respectively. Hove 
also came up big, contributing 
with 44 assists on the night. 

The Tritons will be hitting the 
road next weekend, making stops 
at UC Irvine and UCLA. They will 
then return to the safe confines of 
RlMAC Arena here at home to play 
host to Loyola of Illinois on the 
night of Wednesday, March 7. 

Is California illegally charging 
out-of-state tuition to 

some of its residents?

The suit alleges that California illegally discriminates 
against new state reSidents by charging them 
higher tuition than other state residents. 
The United States Supreme Court in 1973 declared 
unconstitutional a Connecticut law, similar to 
California's Education' Code, whose effect was to 
prevent students that started the University of 
Connecticut as citizens of another state, from being 
allowed to pay "in state" tuition despite becoming 
Connecticut citizens during their attendance 
at that university. 
California's Education Code has the same effect -
requiring three year financial independence for new 
citizens - which effectively prohibits new citizens 
from qualifying for the lower tuition charged to other 
California citizens. This essentially violates the 
California and U.S. Constitution, each of which 
prohibit California from giving any person, once a 
citizen, more or less rights than any other citizens.

Playing to a 
Different 
Tune 

ROBERT FULTON 

W hile gliding down a freeway at 90 mph in the middle of nowhere, 
after a weekend of debauchery in 
the city of sin, a good buddy of 
nllnl' informed ml' of a not very 
well-keF! s~cret. "Dark Side of the 
Moon" by Pink Floyd. those of psy-
chede lic rocker fame, plays in sync 
to the Cinematic classic "The Wiz-
ard of Oz." 

Trippy things happen when you 
pia' the album while watching the 
movie, such as how certain lines 
describe what's happening on the 
screen, and the munchkins boogie 
down to the rhythm of the tunes. 
Was it intentional or not, the band 
is not saying. 

All of this gave me an idea. 
While watching certain athlet ic 
events, it would be a good idea to 
shut out the annoying announcers 
and pop in some of your favorite 
CDs. Here are a few suggestions 
for more pleasant viewi ng experi-
ences: 

While watching the San Diego 
Chargers play, you can pop in 
Beck's album "Mellow Gold" for 
one reason: to listen to the song 
"Loser." While watching the team 
agai n pull defe.at from the jaws of 
victory, you can hear Beck sing the 
anthem of a generation . 

This system works much in the 
way Pink Floyd does with "The 
Wizard of Oz." You can pop in the 
group's 1975 classic "Wish You 
Were Here" while watching either 
the XFL or the NBA. 

In the XFL's case, they wish that 
the fans were here, which they 
aren't if you check out the latest 
raings. 

The NBA's sync goes even 
deeper than that. It sure as hell 
wishes Michael Jordan, Larry Bird 
and Magic Johnson were still 
roaming the court to bring back 
some fans. 

For baseball, lay down in some 
of Guns 'n' Roses ' 1987 classic 
"Appetite for Destruction," which 
is exactly what baseball is doing to 
itself - imploding. 

The marathon song "Shine on 
You Crazy Diamond," also on that 
album. can be an ode to those great 
stars who have moved on in the 
NBA. 

The list would not be complete 
without a Beatles tune somewhere 
in the grand mix . The Beatles' 
"Let it Be" would bode well while 
watching the Lakers play and 
Shaq and Kobe not get along. Or 
as least the media's perception of 
the "feud." Just let it be, let it be. 

Heck, this can work here at 
UCSD. Pop into your portable CD 
player a little "We Are the Champi-
ons" by Queen next time you check 
out the women's soccer team. It 
works fine. 

These are only a few sugges-
tions. There are a million other 
combinations. How abollt you 
own? Just think of a few. If you 
have any ideas, send them to 
sports@ucsdguardian.org. Also, be 
sure to e-mail some suggestions to 
name the Triton mascot (Hungry 
Moses?) and RIMAC Arena 
(Atlantis?). Have fun .

PORTS 
Volleyball Team Enjoys a Rare 
Win, Downing Santa Cruz 
Tritons top the Banana Slugs 3-0, improying record to 2-11 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Associate Sports Editor 

Saturday night at RIMAC 
Arena, the UCSD men's volley-
ball team squared off against 
UC Santa Cruz and handled the 
Banana Slugs in an impressive 
fashion, winning in straight sets 
30-17,30-23 and 30-23. 

The w:!1 was the Tritons' 
second of the season and raised 
their overall record to 2- 11 , 
while they remained at 0-9 in 
the Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation. 

What makes UCSD's win 
even more impressive is the fact 
that UC Santa Cruz, an inde- . 
pendent National College Ath-
letic Association Division III 
program, was ranked second in 
the nation in the latest AVCA 
poll. 

The Tritons started off 
strong in the first game, taking i1 
1-0 lead off a kill by junior out-

the Tritons battled behind 15 
poi nts and six rebounds from

scored 11 points and Ashley 
Kokjohn contributed with 15

ended in double figures in scoring, 
led by Ruvald with 12 points.

Tennis Has Easy Time vs. Coyotes 
Women barely break a sweat, breeze by San Bernardino 9-0 
By BILL BURGER 
Senior Staff Writer 

The women's tennis team was 
beginning to think that it was 
jinxed. After the Tritons headed 
into this weekend with two con-
secutive rainouts, and when their 
match against Western New Mex-
ico University was rained out on 
Friday morning, they were begin-
ning to think that they would 
never again grace the UCSD north 
courts for a match. 

This fear ended on ' Saturday 
when the heavens finally sealed 
their leaks and the team went into 
battle against California State Uni-
versity San Bernardino. 

The team took out it's aggres-
sions on an out-classed Coyote 
squad, rolling to a 9-0 victory. 

No. 3 doubles was over before 
it began. Freshmen Ashley O'Neil 
and Mary Hung put the wood to 
Daniele Quistgard and Kimberly 
Terrill of San Bernardino. It was 
rare when O'Neil and Hung lost a 
point on their way to an 8-0 whip-
ping of their opponents. 

At No. 2 doubles, sophomore 
lVtelisa Liao and freshman Julie 
Westerman looked impressive on 
their way to an 8-2 victory. The 
proset was tied at one when Liao 
smacked a return winner to give 
her team the break of serve that it 
needed. They then went on to 
win the next four gam~s and 

build up an insurmountable 6-1 
lead . ; 

No. 1 doubles provided the 
most drama of the day. Junior 
Lyndsay Tadlock and freshman 
Stephanie Moriarity locked up 
with Coral Conley and Cassie 
Sumroe of the Coyotes. 

The match was on serve until 
an overhead put away by Conley 
gave the Coyotes a break of serve 
and a 5-4 lead. The duo extended 
that lead to 4-6, but after Tadlock 
held serve, Moriarity hit a huge 
backhand return to set up double 
break point and then put away a 
volley to get the Tritons back on 
serve at 6-6. The Coyotes broke 
Tadlock again and eventually they 
stood at set point. Tadlock hit a 
solid VOlley winner to get back to 
deuce. 

UCSD even'tually won the 
game and sent the match to a tie-
breaker, where it shut down the 
Coyotes on it's way to a 7-1 victo-
ry. 

"It shouldn't have been that 
close, but anything can happen 
in doubles when you just playa 
proset, n said bead coach Liz 
Laplante. "I was pleased with 
how they were able to get their 
focus back and fight off a match 
point to win 7-1 in the tie-break-

After doubles, the Thtons had a 
3-0 lead and the margin would 
only get bigger as the match went

along. 
At No. 1 singles, O'Neil shel-
la~ked Conley and showed no 
mercy on the way to a 6-1 , 6-0 vic-
tory. 

The same was true for Tadlock, 
who achieved the rare double-
bagel at No. 2 doubles, cruising to 
a 6-0, 6-0 victory. 

Liao had no problems at No. 3, 
winning the match handily 6-0, 6-
1 . Freshman Kristina Jansen 

stepped in after not playing dou-
bles and showed no signs of rust 
during her 6-1 , 6-1 skunking of 
her opponent. 

At No. 3 singles, Westerman 
looked dominant from the base-
line in her 6-0, 6-1 triumph. 

The most interesting of the 
singles matches was the No. 6 sin-
gles between Moriarity and Ter-
