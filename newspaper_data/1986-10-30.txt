Scripps receives 
$6 million donation 

Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography received a $6 
mUUon dollar gift from a small 
Delaware foundation Tuesday to 
help buUd a new aquarium. 

The donation , which was from 
the Stephen and Mary Birch 
Foundation puts the project near 
its $8.2 mUlion fund·raisin!!; goal 
and represents one:sixth of the 
total $30 million goal of UCSD's 
25th Anniversaty Campaign and 
is the largest gift ever received by 
the campus. 

The new aquarium will include 
36 tanks ranging in size up to 
30,000 gallons, displaying marine 
animals in natural.appearing 
habitats representing the coast of 
CaUfornia on the Sea of Conez 
in Mexico, if the plans are 
approved by the UC Board of 
Regents. 

The faciUty will also contain a 
marine educational center for the 
thousands of school children 
who visit the existing aquarium 
evety year. 

Special correspondent 
speaks on Afghanistan 

Edward R.. Girardet, Special 
Correspondent for the Chnstian 
Science Monitor will host a 
seminar on "Afghanistan: Military 
Developments in the Soviet 
War: 

This luncheon seminar will be 
held on November 4 from 12:00 
to 2:00 in the Muir College Nonh 
Dining Room. Girardet will 
explore the complexities in 
detennining the status of 
Afghanistan and the Soviet 
Union as reports continue to 
conflict 

The United States insists that 
since 1984 there has been little 
enlargement of Soviet troups, 

while other sources paint a grim 
picture of increased Soviet 
expeditionaty forces working at 
night and arranging ambushes 
along trails. 

Some, like a member of 
Afghanistan'S guerilla force 
Mujahideen, feel the war has 
been equany hard for both sides 
though it appears the soviets, 
with their superior equipment 
and training, have recently been 
able to gain ground and add to 
the segregation of Afghanistan'S 
various guerilla groups.

Scripps physicist wins 
achievement award 

The 1986 award for 
outstanding achievement in 
scientific research and 
development was presented to 
Victor C. Anderson, a research 
physicist and deputy director at 
San Diego's Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography. 

The award, which bears the 
title of "The Admiral Charles B. 
Martell Technical Excellence 
Award," was a result of 
Anderson's work involving the 
designing and development of 
the Digital Multibeam Sleering 
System (D1MUS). This electronic 
system can distinguish between a 
wide variety of sounds beneath

Presently, Anderson is working 
on the development of sea floor

ASIO provides 
work experience 
By TAMARA HICKS 
The Associated Students Internship Office (ASIO) has prOvided 
internship opponunities at local, state, and national levels for 
both undergraduate and graduate UCSD students since 1979. 

The program, which is funded by Associated Students and is 
student run, offers hands on experience, future contacts and 
the chance to explore career goals. Marguarite Clark, a two year , 
ASIa volunteer and intern at the San Diego Magazine, stated 
that, "this program is directed towards students who are 
concerned about their future . These interns do not receive 
money or credits." 

Several hundred organizations participating with ASia by 
placing interns have enabled the program to offer twelve 
ditlerent internship field: Arts, Communications, Environment, 
Health , International Aff:lirs , Science and Technology, Business. 
Education, Government, Human Services, Legal and Urban 
Affairs . "Basically we offer evetything one could be interested in. 
The organizations have good reputations, such as Hewlett 
Packard, UCSD Medical Center, Merrlll Lynch Reality , San 
Diego City Attorneys Office and many of our interns go to 
Washington D.C.: commented Clark. 

The Minority Internship Program is the most recent addition 
to ASia. Last year's directors decided it would be a good idea 
to add the fifth depanment. "Many organizations such as NASA 
and Coca·Cola specifically ask for minorities since they feel 
minorities are under represented, "MinOrity Affairs Director, 
Monica Finkel, said. 

Ten organizaoons have been located so far, that would not 
have been available without the minority department. The 
program is attempting to be more specific and to fulfill the 
needs of evetyone. 'We are adjusting to the needs of our 
sponsors and hope by the end of the year we have interns for 
all students," stated Finkelberg. 

Since the program is JUSt getting off the ground ASIa would 
appreciate input from minorities, to improve it even more. 

The internship process begins several weeks prior to the 
quarter in which the student wishes to work because time is 
needed to identify, screen, counsel and refer quaUfied students 
to organizations. Since it is important to keep up the reputation 
of ASIa, specific selection criteria are used. These include: 
extracurricular activities, academic standing, leadership ability, 
enthusiasm, commitment, coursework, career goals, maturity, 
oral communication and writing skills. 

The intern and the sponsoring organization negotiate the 
length and work schedule of each internship . 

To assist students, ASia provides, career counseling; resume, 
cover letter, and interview counseling; transportation, housing 
and social arrangements. 

The UCSD student pays a $5.00 cover charge. Although , the 
avera)!.e cost of an internship outside of the San Diego area 
exceeds $1 ,500. This price includes transportation and living 
costs. Therefore, ASia holds many fund raising event~ to offset 
these costs, Finkelberg said. . ~

Debate marred by mud slinging 
By JOHN SINGH 

JIM Bates and Btll Mitchell . congressional candidates from San Otego's 44th 
District, squared off in a 

debate Tuesday on the steps of 
the Main Gym in final 
preparation for next Tuesday'S 
election. 

Before a crowd of about 100. 
Republican candidate Mitchell 
sharply cntictzed Democratic 
incumbent Bates' stand on many 
issues and oITered strong 
criticism of Bates' tenure . 

Bates managed to WIn the 
crowd's visible support, however, 
with remarks about President 
Reagan's performance at the 
recent Reykjavik summit and his 
opposition of Reagan's Strategic 
Defense Initiative (SDI). 

"I think the president blew it ." 
said Bates, responding to an 
onlooker's questioning about the 
Iceland summit. 

Mitchell was cautiously 
optimistic about the summit's 
outcome, and said he sup pons 
the SOl program. 

·When I first heard about it 
(SDI), I listened to the scientists 
and they're saying, 'It doesn't 
work. ' But Gorbachev and 
Reagan think it will work. Why 
is Gorbachev so concerned about 
'Star Wars' if it won't work?" 
Michell said . 

Other topiCS discussed during 
the debate, sponsored by the 
Associated Studenrs, included 
Tijuana sewage control and the 
control of illegal drug usage. 

One issue both candidates 
were able to agree on was 
Proposirion 63, the "English 
Only" inuiative, which Bates 
called "a dumb proposition ," and 
Mitchell characterized as "written 
improperly (and) too vague." 

The size of the crowd seemed 
to disappoint Bates. who said , 
"I'm sorry that more students 
aren't here." 

Mitchell, however, said he 
thought the crowd represented 
the conservative fraction of 3 
mostly liberal school. 

"Students are becoming more 
and more conservative. Here 
they're more liberal. You can tell 
from the reaction of the 
audience ," Mitchell said. ~ 

Prop. 64 deemed inaccurate 
By JAMES GILMORE, Staff Writer 

ONE of the most controversial measures facing California voters 
this November is the Acquired 
Immune Deficiency Syndrome 
(AIDS) initiative, known as 
Proposition 64. 

Prop . 64 declares that AIDS 
and the condition of being a 
carrier of the HIV virus are 
communicable, contagious 
diseases and would require both 
to be placed on the list of 
reportable diseases and 
conditions maintained by the 
director of the Department of 

Health Servi ces. 
This would in tum require 

physicians and other health care 
providers to repon any cases to 
state/ublic health offiCials who 
woul execute the statutes in the 
pubUc health code regarding 
such communicable diseases. 

First diagnosed in 1981 , AIDS 
is a disease which impairs the 
body's normal ability to resist 
other diseases and infections. 
The disease is 'caused by a virus 
known as HTLV·m, or HIV, and 
is spread through intimate sexual 
contact or exposure 'to the blood 

of an infected person 
Currently, aU cases of AIDS are 

being reponed under a 
regulation which requires an 
unusual disease , not listed as a 
communicable disease , to be 
reported by local health ofTicers. 
In addition, hospitals are also 
required to repon AIDS cases, 
and counties are required to 
repon the number of cases in 
which blood tests revealed a 
patient to be antibody positive 
the HIV virus. 

One point of debate about 
the initiative is whether it will

remove the ability of public 
health offiCials to use their 
discretion if dealing with AIDS 
patients and carriers of HIV or 
force them to initiate the 
mandatory provisions in the 
state Health and Safety Code. 

Supporters of the initiative 
claim It will keep AIDS out of 
schools, commercial food 
establishments, give health 
officials the power to test and 
quarantine where needed , and 
thereby bring the spread of the 
disease under control. 

Opponents contend that since 
the measure states that aU public 
health officers "shall fulfill all of 
the duties and obligations" 
specified in all sections of the 
public health code, it will 

mandate that they act without 
discretion to isolate and 
quarantine AIDS patients and 
carriers, exclude infected persons 
from schools and food handling 
posidons. and mandate testing of 
various groups for the AIDS virus. 

According to Dr. F. Douglas 
Scutchfield, Director and 
Professor of the Graduate School 
of Public Health at SDSU, 
"Proposition 64 is directly 
counter to the recommendations 
of the Center for Disease Control 
(CDC) and other national and 
international bodies who have 
studied the issues surrounding 
the transmission of AIDS." Sir.ce 
AIDS can only be transmitted 
through intimate sexual contact 
and the exposure to the blood of

The LaRouche conspiracy 
By RICHARD W. JOSEPH III 

Scary. Drastic. Dangerous. The 
AIDS initiative on the November 
4th ballot, is aU that and much 
more. 

Sponsored by a group called 
PANIC, it is an inmative that 
could have tremendous effects 
on all of California, and possibly 
set precedents for the entire 
nation. Political extremist 
Lyndon La Rouche proves once 
again that he will stop at nothing 
to gain the political power that 
he so badly wants. Running a 
campaign that IS promoted 
through fear, half-truths, and 
misunderstanding, Proposition 
64 is another example of 
laRouche's scary political Views, 

The AIDS initiative. if 
approved by the voters, could 
effectively lead to a quarantine of 
all AIDS victims, and possibly 
even those who carry the AIDS 
virus but do nOt have the 
disease , There are about 5,188 
cases of AIDS in California, and 
Health Department officials 
estimate that there are over 
500,000 people carryi ng the AIDS 
virus, 

Lyndon LaRouche, who has 
obtained a large number of 
dedicated followers across the 
nation, has political beliefs that 
are quite bizzare, to say the least. 
For example, La Rouche has said 
that the Queen of England is 

involved in a profitable drug 
trade, and is essentially a drug 
pusherHe has said that the 
coumry of Isreal is a zombie 
nation , and is actually ruled and 
controlled by London. And 
incredibly, laRouche has said 
that the German Nazi Holocaust 
was a complete hoax, and that 
six million murdered jews are 
mythical, contrary to any 
competent historical records and 
witnesses to the terrible horrors 
of Hitler's regime. 

Crazy as his theories are, Prop 
64 has a very good chance of 
winning on the November 4th 
ballot. laRouche is a brilliant 
political strategist. His highly 
organized political network is 
capable of pushing tremendous 
amounts of propaganda 
promoting laRouche's ideas, and 
they have been hard at work 
pushing Prop 64, 

His campaign has almost 
unlimited funds , even though 
some of laRouche's fund raising 
actlvllies are under investigation . 
And it is also important to 
remember LaRouche has already 
collected hundreds of thousands 
of Signatures in support of the 
tnitlative to get Prop 64 on the 
ballot in the first place, 

Furthermore , to show that 
laRouche has li ttle idea of the 
seriousness of this initiative, or 

little knowledge of the initiative 
itself, he has said that the 
International Monetary Fund is 
purposely engineering the AIDS 
epidemic to eradicate excess 
population in Africa. 

Prop 64, if it passes, could 
eventually require Health 
Department officials to create 
some sort of mandatory testing 
program, And since it would be 
highly illegal to test just certain 
high risk groups, it could lead to 
mandatory testi ng for all 
Californians; this means you tOo! 

The initiative could also 
require Health Department 
officials to quarantine all people 
carrying the AIDS VIruS, not JUSt 
people who have the disease, but 
anyone who carries the virus. 
This would mean over a half 
million people under state 
quarantine, for a disease that is 
not communicable, and can't be 
passed through casual contact. 
Imagine 25% of San Diego's 
population under quarantine, 
even though they have no 
disease. 

The California Medical 
Association, the California 
Nurses Association , and the 
California Hospital Association. 
the three most prestigiOUS 
medical organizations in 
California, all vigorously oppose 
Prop 64. They believe Prop 64 

Rose Bird's last stand 

would seriously hurt their abiblity 
to treat AIDS, not to mention 
their continuing search to find a 
cure. 

If Prop 64 passes, people 
infected with the disease would 
be reluctant to seek treatment, in 
fear of being quarantined, losing 
their Jobs, or being victim to 
other discriminatory acts. The 
availablity of patients for 
experimental drugs, would be 
scarce and most likely 

inadequate. 
The initiative would effectively 

drive AIDS underground . The 
terrible disease could then be 
spread in incredible numbers, 
with no statistics ever being able 
to be valid again, 

It is easy to see thelro's of 
of posing Prop 64, an the con's 
o supporting it. But the only 
way you can have a say in this 
initiative is go to the polls and 
vote on November 4th. ~

Editor: 

It's rare that single events can 
change the course of world 
hiStory. It's rarer still when 
students can play an Important 
role In such eve nts. The 
November 4th elections can 
fundamentally alter our future . 
Indeed, these elections can 
determtne whether there IS a 
future at all 

Voting provides the 
oppOrtUnll)' for students to make 
our vIews known on VItal Issues 
facing the country We can also 
gIve them clout by helping elect 
a Congress that shares our VIews, 

Today's student activism 
renects the consClen e of our 
nation MIllIOns of people 
oppose the arms bUild-up, 
apanheid , intervention In 
Central Arnenca, cutbacks In 
student aid and other SOCIal 
programs and new levels of 
racism and discnminatlon . On 
these issues we share the 
sentiments of the overwhelming 
majority of the U. S, people . It is 
the Reagan Admimstration and 
its supporters that are out of step 
with the people of our country 
and the world , 

For six years students have 
been taking it on rhe chin 
During the Reagan presidency 
tUillon has gone up 34%, Every 
year we fight admln istratJon 
anempts to Impose deep cut In 
student ald . The funds axed 
from these and other ~ocl3l 
programs is dIve ned to the 
astronomically expensIve arms 
build-up This mcludes Reagan's 
tar War., program that WIll co~t 

an e timateo I trillton dollar~ 
over the !lext 5 years 

Today we have rCell

Iceland the Reagan 
aomlnJstraUon h,lo; blo(kcJ thl~ 

process As Rep Ed Markey of 
Massachu ens saId, ·The 
president has sent the world a 
message that he does not want 
arms control and that he has put 
his faith in the stardust 
moonbeams of his Star Wars 
fantasies," 

EIghty percent of the people 
of the U. , support a nuclear test 
ban. The House recently voted 
for a moratorium on all but the 
smallest nuclear explOSIons, A 
majority also opposes Star Wars. 
The IS-month SovIet moratorium 
on nuclear testi ng means a 
histOric agreement IS withtn 
reach, 

The admInistration can be 
compelled to reverse ItS 
disasterous course . But to do 
thIS, we need a change In the 
political balance in Congress. 
This November, we can do that, 
by electing a pro-peace and pro-
people majority to the u.s. 
Senate . 

What we do from now unlll 
November 4th to ensure a 
maxImum turnout of the 12 
mtllion possible student voters 
can make the difference. We, the 
undersigned past and present 
student leaders urge that every 
effort be made to inspire our 
fnends and fellow students to 
vote against candidates who 
support Reagan 's poliCies. 

ovember 4th IS a chance to 
serve the cause fo peace and to 
reverse Reaganism. Let's do aU 
we ca n, for our generation and 
our planet We're surc we can

Comrary to the pro-Arab 
rhetoric, there has never been 
any kind of respect for human 
hfe In the Arab world . Ever since 
achIeving Unity under the banner 
of Islam, terrorism, blackmail and 
extonion have been the accepted 
norms, Dating back to the year 
\033 in Granada Spain , 5000 

Jews were ruthlessly murdered by 
Arab mobs. In 1066, 6000 Jews 
were murdered In Fez Morocco 
In the same fashion What has 
been forgotten is that during 
World War (( many Arab leaders 
came out on the side of azi 
Germany of which , (The Grand 
Mufti of jerusalem) was 
convicted at Nuhremberg, The 
State of Isreal is but a fixation on 
which the Arab leaders 
(including the PLO) can focus 
their insane hatred of Jews. 

The origin of the word 
"assassination" has it's roots in 
the Arabi language, In the 
1100's a group of men from Syria 
called the "assassins" claimed it 
was their divine purpose to 
murder theIr political opponents 
Today, this attitude has 
manifested Itself in the 
a~sasstnations of Anwar adat,

Whipping toxic wastes 
By MIKE BARBER 

ELECTION time is coming up fast, meaning that there is a great deal of confUSion 
among everyone trying to decide 
who and what to vote for, 
PropOSition 65 , the Toxic Waste 
initiative. or ·Clean Water 
Initiative ." alone could do the 
trick of driving the sanest person 
crazy, 

Essentially what this ballot 
measure is trytng to accomplish 
is to help inform and protect the 
public in the case of dangerous 
toxins responsible for causing 
cancer, sterility, and birth 
defects. It will require the 
governor to publish a list of the 
chemicals which cause these 
problems and keep businesses 
with 10 or more employees from 
discharging harmful amounts of 
these chemicals into drinking 
water. These businesses would 
also be forced to give clear 
warning to anyone who would be 
exposed to any of the chemicals 
on the governor's list if the 
amount of exposure is shown to 
be dangerous, Each violation of a 
business with these ' laws would 
result in a $2,500 a day fine as 
well as the possibility of lawsuits 
from individuals. ThiS 
proposition would also increase 
the penalties of some eXisting 

laws on the disposal of toxic 
wastes. 

On the outside this would 
appear to be a vety good law 
and I believe it is; however, there 
are a number of things that must 
be considered , most important of 
which is that of cost. Estimates 
of enforcement costs by state 
and local agencies for 1987 are 
around $500,000 and could 
easily reach and surpass $1 
million in the years to follow. 

Another issue of cost appears 
in the area of testing, which will 
need to be done on chemicals 
used by busmesses and 
industries so that a safe exposure 
level can be eS!:l.blished - If it 
does exist The COStS here could 
run into millions. and most likely 
be paid for by the business or 
industry wishing to use the 
chemical in order to prove the 
safeness of a chemical's 
continued use , 

It may not sound like a good 
idea to pass a measure that has 
some uncertain definitions In it, 
but both sides of the arguemem 
on Proposition 65 say that the 
passage of this measure would 
mean that almost immediate 
action would have to be taken 
on the issue of toxic waste. 
Nothing is more ridiculous, 

selfish , and immature than the 
use of chemicals that have the 
short term effect of bting 
"convenient and getting results· 
when the long term effects do 
cause serious damage to human 
beings, 

The one gaping loophole in 
Proposition 65 is ItS exemption 
clause, which excludes publicly-
owned nuclear plants, city 
sewage plants, public water 
systems, military bases, and 
county land fills from having to 
follow 65's regulations about their 
drainage systems; however, it is 
not much of a loophole when 
one considers that there are 
already laws governing the 
disposal of wastes from these 
places, and that the exclusion of 
these places make Proposition 65 
less complicated . Any excessive 
complications in this measure 
would have been disastrous since 
it probably would have resulted 
in the failure of qualifying it In 
time for this ballot. 

We just do not have any more 
time. We must stop funher 
pollution in this state and begin 
searching for safe alternatives to 
the many dangerous chemicals 
in use today. That is why I urge 
you to vote yes on Proposition 
65. ~

Grounds for Murder is not 
a new fi lm about th e 
Southeast Asian Experience. 
It is a San Diego bookstore 
that specializes in mysteries 
and other varieties of 
detective fiction . For more 
than five years. it has occupied 
a space on the second floor of 
the Old Town Mercado 
bUilding on Congress Street, a 
few hundred yards from one 
of the oldest hoURS in San

A 
haunting 
house 
by amanda mcdonald 

Evil spirits and creatures 
invade the small courtyard 
and wander freely amongst 
the crowd of all ages to 
prepare for the eerie and 
frightening voyage through 
the Haunted Museum. Balboa 
Park's Museum of Man, 
which is holding its 13th 
annual "Haunted Museum," 
dubbed "Medival Mayhem," 
continues its terrifying 
tradition until Halloween 
night. 

To ensure that the crowd 
gathered to witness this 
haunting event is jumpy. these 
ghouls, dressed in elaborate 
period clothing, slither up 
behind the unsuspecting and 
grab from out of -nowhere, 
with loud and shocking 
screams. These ghosts set the 

well - informed staff of 
enthusiasts. 

Brown denies that she 
started the bookstore with the 
idea of competing with chain 
stores. Small indiVidually-run 
bookstores cannot get the 
discounts that chain 
bookstores can get from 
publishers. so covering a 
specialty subject or " having 
really good service" is 

mood of terror for the 
frightening trip that awaits 
inside. The trip inside the 
museum not only includes the 
evils of the Medieval time 
frame, but also has frights 
akin to the preSent day. 

The horror continues as the 
spook filled maze beckons to 
the brave souls in the crowd. 
Travelling through a grisl., 
graveyard with roving corpses 
and shifting headstones, one 
finds way through a 
caveman's dark and gloomy 
lair .... 

Wandering slowly through 
hallways pulsating with strobe 
lights and also ones of utter 
darkness. the crowd 
eventually comes to the 
delectible gourmet feast 
where possessed phantoms 
munch hungrily on semi-
realistic human organs. The 
adventurous may accept an 
appetizer of an eyeball from a 
silver platter or perhaps. a 
tasty ear.

An 
irregular 
beat 

by dave fonnan and 
louise belford root 

All dressed up with no 
place to go on Halloween 
night? Try The Regular Guys 
at the Bacchanal. These boys 
are the tightest blues-rock 
band to play in San Diego in 
some time, Returning as 
headliners, The Regular Guys 
are guaranteed to provide 
three hours of the most foot-
stomping, energetic music 
that this city has seen, and it 
won't be possible to hear 
them without dancing. 

To call The Regular Guys 
merely danceable is a 
criminally understated term 
for their talents. Their music 
ranges from rockabilly to 
Badboy Blues, paying heed to 
almost every other musical 
tradition 'along the way. This 
band could play at a sixties 
sock hop or a seedy beer joint, 
and in either instance leave 
their audience satisfied. Their 
relentless drive makes you 
twist, hustle, or just plain 
strut your stuff, although 
their main appeal is their 
dance appeal. . 

The Regular Guys are 
powered by all seven 
members of the band. Lead 
guitar player Roy Furshpan 
and bass player/ lead singer 
Simply Dave started the band 
in Claremont, California in 
1983. Simply Dave is in 
control of the show most of 
the time, joking with the 
crowd and shamelessly 
promoting the band and their 
one album, Distressed. 
Meanwhile, Furshpan 
playfully jumps around the 
stage, frequently settling 
down into intense closed-eyed 
solos. Rick Sterbentz on 

serious fans of any particular 
genre of artistic endeavor 
(such as science-fiction fans 
or punk rockers), tend to be 
close-knit, communicative, 
and openly supportive of the 
efforts of leading practitioners 
in various ways. Brown, for 
example, publishes a 
quarterly newsletter for her 
customers, which contains a 
large number of short reviews 

Grounds for Murder is a 
fun place to shop for books, 
for mysteries that the chain 
stores do not or cannot stock . 
It is a celebration of a genre. 
and of the concept that even 
avarice. jealousy. gluttony, 
lust, and chaos. even the 
darkest impulses of the 
human psyche can be put into 
writing for the purpose 
entertainment.

keyboards belts out the blues 
numbers with expert 
l;lccuracy. His lively barritone 
and creative jazz/ blues riffs 
help to define his character, as 
he slouches over his pi,ano 
top, engulfed in booze and 
cigarettes. Drummer Martin 
Maudal keeps a steady beat 
and offers interesting solos. 

The heart of the band is in 
their three-man horn section, 
composed of Tim Clark, Sal 
Misquez and Terry Fritts. 
They are what truly sets The 
Regular Guys apart from most 
bands. As background 
musicians for the singers, they 
are subtle and richly textured. 
As soloists, each masters his 
instrument. though no one is 
the star. They divide their 
solos and blend their passages 
like one player. The highlight 
of the live performance comes 
during a song called "Coke 
Snorting Woman," when the 
three sax players leave the 
stage and situate themselves in 
different areas of the club. 
trading off solos, and literally 
surrounding the audience 
with sound. 

Of their ambitions, Simply 
Dave jokes that he wants his 
name next to Mozart's, but 
then comments, "What we're 
really trying to do is gain 
respectability as musicians." 
They have over an album's 
worth of new material, and are 
eager to sign a contract and cut 
a second record. 

The truth behind their band 
name, Simply Dave explains, 
is that they tossed out 
hundreds of possible names, 
and picked the lesser of all 
evils. Though they decided on 
The Regular Guys, the name is 
clearly ironic, as regular guys 
do not make music like this. 
They will be in town 
tomorrow night (Halloween) 
as well as Saturday night at the 
Bacchanal in Clairemont, and 
it should prove to be another 
exciting night of good times 
and great music. The band 
promises to be in costume and 
urges those coming to do the 
same. Doors open at 8 pm and 
the show begins at 9:30. 
Cover is $3 . For more 
information, 560-8022. 



Music 
with a 
byte 

by sebaltian j. french 
To commemorate Ameri-

can Music Week. SONOR, 
the USCD new musi c 
ensemble. will perform a 
conce rt on Wednesday, 
November S. Among the 
pieces that will be played is 
" Diapason " by UCSD 
graduate student Pau l 
Koonce, who was the first to 
receive the $9000 Maxwell 
and Muriel Gluck fellowship 
in composition. 

Koonce first studied and 
received a master's degree in 
composition at the University 

of Illinois. A piece he wrote, 
"Rule Ill." was a finalist in the 
Luigi Russolo International 
Electronic Music Competi-
tion in 1977. and appears on 
The U niversity of lLlinois 
Electronic Music Studios' 

25th anniversary album. 
Soon afterward, he received 

a UC Regents fellowship to 
pursue a Ph.D. in composi-
tion at UCSD. Since that 
time. he has composed several 
other works. "Escape Tone," 
for solo flute. was performed 
at the Darmstadt Summer 
Institute. and "Transient," a 
computer-aided piece, was 
performed at The Interna-
tional Computer Music 
Festival in Koriyama, Japan. 

Koonce's style is what he 
describes as. " the way 1 think 
about things. " He has certain 
structures and systems for 
looking at the organization of 
sounds. He doesn't like doing 
the same thing twi ce, 
however, so his style isn't 
associated with a specific 
structure; it's all in the way he 
perceives the sound. 

UCSD is the only place in 
the U.S. with a Center of 
Music Experiment. and the 
main reason he enjoys 
studying at UCSD is because 
the music department is 
interested in new music 
techniques, whether they be 
novel approaches to an old 
instrument or computer-
aided compositions. 

His latest work, "Diapa-
son," is a melding of different 
instrumental sounds accom-
panying a constant piano 
me lody . The SONOR 
concert, " Contemporary 
Masterpieces." will be held in 
the Mandeville Auditorium at 
8 pm. Tickets are $1 for 
students, faculty, and senior 
citizens , and $3 for general 
admission. 

A heart 
aching 

• Issue 
by 8u8ie beel 

Why did the United States 
government ignore the AIDS 
issue for two years while it 
reached 'epidemic propor-
tions? This is one of the many 
questions asked by The 
Normal Heart, a play by Larry 
Kramer which is currently 
playing at the North Coast 
Repertoiry Theatre. This play 
chronicles the beginnings of 
AIDS in New York City. and 
one man's attempt to alert the 
community and society to the 
disease and its ramifications. 

Doug Roberts, a graduate 
of UCSD. gives a superb 
performance as Ned Weeks, 
the main character who must 
combat people from all sides 
during his crusade. His 
fTustration is felt in the futility 
of his actions. We wa tch as his 
electric tirades, which attempt 
to promote action, sink into 
despair when Felix, his friend 
and lover, contracts the 
disease with no cure in sight. 
Ned is played with such 
emotion and passion that the 
audience cannot help but 
sympathize, which makes this 
play work. The characters in 
this play are just normal men 
who have normal jobs as 
writers and vice-presidents. 

Bill Maauand Douglas Robensin "TheNormalHeart." 

and they also have normal 
hearts, which become 
anguished as friends continue 
to die. 

This play does not sugar 
coat issues. It does not set up 
gays as martyrs for their cause. 
In fact, the opposite can be 
seen. Ned forms a council to 
help accomplish his goals, but 
this council disagrees with 
Ned on some very fundamen-
tal issues. It is clear to Ned 
that in order to try to curb this 
dangerous disease, gay men 
must stop haVing sex, but the 
council opposes Ned, and will 
not back him until there is 
factual evidence that the 
disease is spread through 
sexual contact. The message is 
clear that all the blame cannot 
be placed on the government; 
the gay community did not 

help themselves. 
The Normal Heart has a very 

prophetic air about it; many 
of the things about which Ned 
warns his friends have in fact 
come true, the most 
astonishing and horrifying of 
which is the reference Ned 
makes to the concentration 
camps in which he fears gays 
will be placed. With 
LaRouche's Proposition 64, 
this could actually become a 
reality. It appears that the 
fight for human rights is 
never-ending. 

This play points a lot of 
fingers. but not just at the 
government and the gay 
community. Fingers are also 
pointed at Ned for trying to 
destroy the freedom gays have 
been working so long to

Focusing in 
By NANCY WIllIAMS 

D o we really exist? Is the soul immortal? In the world of an average 
undergraduate student at UCSD, 
where a major concern is how to 
make a living in life-after-college, 
philosophical questions su h as 
these often receive a resounding 
·Who cares?" 

However, there is a new field 
in town which could change thIS 
apathy. The scIence of 
phenomenology, which IS a 
branch of philosophy, takes 
these broad philosophIcal 
questions and brings them to a 
more individual , personal level. 
The name comes from the Greek 
·phenestal" which means "to 
bring into the light." Through 
concentration on unique events 
in an individual's life, the 
science brings out the 
consciousness embodied In these 
events. 

The process involves what is 
called a phenomenologIcal 
reduction In which the 
Individual PUtS aside all 

awareness of the "real" world and 
the "real" self to concentrate on 
the Inner consciousness. An 
analogy can be made with 
Intense involvement in a good 
book. As a person tunes out the 
outside or "real" world, he 
becomes absorbed In the action 
within the book, forgeting about 
what is happemng around 
oneself. 

In phenomenology, the book 
is fIguratively the thread of 
consciousness In forms such as 
memory, love , desire hate , which 
connect a person with other 
people, places and things in 
"real" h fe . By separatIng and 
regroupIng these threads, a 
person is able to look at his 
personal relanonships wah the 
real world and deal with larger 
phIlosophical questions as they 
perraIn to oneself. 

The science began at the tum 
of the century as a means to 
clarify logICal questions. Its 
founder was Edmond Husser! , a

German logician and 
mathematician Phenomenology 
is more \videspread and popular 
on the European conllnent than 
it IS In the UnIted Sta tes. In the 
U.S., the interesr is concentra ted 
in Seatde, WashIngton in the 
Northwestern Society for 
Phenomenology and 
Existentialism. It is also 
spreading lhrough California 
with help from leaders such as 
Professor Dallas Willard at rhe 
University of Sourh CalifornIa, 
and Dr. Jim Ruddy. a visiting 
se holar at UCSD. 

Dr. Ruddy, a nallve San 
Diegan, became Interested in 
phenomenology when he was 
workIng towards his doctorare 
degree ar Madras University In 
Sourh India. He is currently 
developing a new theory of 
phenomenology called 
convergent phenomenology 
which deals with relation-lIke 
rather than rhlng-like objectivity. 

Dr. Ruddy studies 
phenomenology WIth a passion . 
He belIeves rhat "unless one 
rushes tOward philosophy like a 
person whose clothes are on fire 
rushes into a river, one does nor 
yet know what philosophy is." 
His goal is to establish a forum 
for professors and students from 
all over southern CalifornIa who 
srudv or are interested In 
phenomenology Becau~ of the 
nature of phenomenology, Dr. 
Ruddy stresses that the forum 
scheduled for Novemb.:r is 
designed to be an informal 
discussion rather rhan a seminar 
or lecture series, ~

celebration may seem, many of 
these Celtic customs survIved after 
the Roman invasion. And around 
800 AD. the church established All 
Saints Day, and these old pagan 
custOms were incorporared into 
rhis Christian holy day. 

According to an Irish legend, 
jack-o'-lanterns were named for a 
man called Jack, who could not 
enter heaven because he was a 
miser, nor could he enter hell 
because he had played jokes on the 
devil. As a result, Jack had to walk 
the eanh with his lantern until 
Judgement Day.

Winning used to be everything 
By GUSTAVO SANTOYO 6t KAREN KUMM 

PICTURE this: you're hosting a pally and you go th rough mericulous 
details to ensure your jete IS a 
rager. There's plenry of room to 
sit and talk (even scream), 
dazzling enrertainment, lors of 
women, and even some food . But 
the day of your precisely tuned 
evenr arnves and nobody shows. 
It's a SOCial disaster and you 
become about as popular as Bill 
Buckner. 

This the type of feeli ng Doug 
DanneVlk must deal wi th every 
time the UCSD women's 
volleyball team has a home 
match. Small crowds have cursed 
the fonner number one team in 
the nation as their populariry 
remains at a low ebb. Schools 
usually support a winning team , 
but in this case winning isn't 
everything. 

"I think a solution is that we 
find a way that the people who 
live on campus know that there 
are matches," said Dannevik. 
"But that's nor my job. That's 

"[ I hink a solution Lr. that 
we find a way that the 
people know that there are 
matches. But that's Judy 
Malone and Laurel Dean 's 
job." 
-Doug DanneviJr 

Laurel Dean and j udy Malone's to be d issappoinred: 
job." Promorion of the team has 

hard to fight back when the 
crowd isn't behind vou." 

Dannevik feels that hiS team 
could get those cheering crowds 
if they had a little more help 
from the school's hierarchy. "I've 
never heard any of our campus 
adminis trators making comments 
about the success of athletic 
teams," said Dannevik. "They're 
always asked to make some 
comment about chemistry 
research or a Nobel prize winner, 
but never on athletics. Maybe it's 
because they are never asked . I 
think that it's important that 
people like Chancellor (Richard) 
Atkinson supports athletics.· 

Atkinson has not set a stellar 
example of directly voicing his 
support to Dannnevik or his 
volleybaO teams of the past. 
Atkinson sent a letter of 
congrarulation to the team in 
1981 for winning the national 
championship , but failed to do 
so for the 1984 national 
championship team. Dannevik 
himself has only spoken to him 
once. 

'We're up against a lot of 
competition here. We 're 
doing a pretty good job, but 
of course when the crowds 
are small, the coaches are 
going to be disappointed." 
-Judy Malone 

"I saw him at his house when 
we had our team picture taken 
in 1984," said Dannevik. "It's the 
only time I've seen him since 
1981. I'm sure he's a busy guy, 
but he's a Division I Stanford 
guy. I don't know if he's that 
supportive of Division Ill : ' 

Athletic director judith Sweet, 
however, is one person who's 
sure that the administration is 
back In UCSD athletics. "Based 
on my experience with the 
administration , they are very 
supportive," said Sweet. "I think 
we are a priOrity, but their time 
is spread out and they can't take 
care of every group as they 
would like to ." 

But according to assistant 
athletic director, Mike Hipp, 
come ovember, the crowds will 
get better. "In October, Students 
are still getting established but 
then around November they start 
to realize how good the team on 
campus is doing and then they 
Stall to come out to the games 
near the end of the season and 
regionals." ~ 

Malone and Dean are the rwo also been some of the player's 
people in charge of promoting complaints. Carol Lipson , a third 
UCSD athletics and so far nor year player on the team feels that 
much has been able to lure the fi nding a solution to sc hool 
crowds into th e gym. But small apathy is "the question of the 
crowds have nor been a year: For Lipson, pub~city is the 
deterrent . key, and It hasn 't been as good

curriculum for the students. It 
takes hours of planning because 
it not only involves his thinking, 
but also the opinions of the 
Students bod y. Mr. Vitale takes 
into consideratlon what people 
prefer and constructs a 
curriculum to fit everyones tastes. 
"The big thing right now is 
fi tness and aerobics." As a result 
of the planning he spent about 
rwo weeks solely on the winter 
schedule. When Mr. Vitale is not 
Stayi ng behind his d esk all day 
wi th sched uli ng, he tcaches. The 
ex-coach is presently Ins tructing 
St udents on \\lClgh t trai ning and 
fltnrss 

He became the head of the 
Instructional branch at the 
begm ning of th e present school 
year. The admini strative change 
In hiS branch was one of many 
changes in the P.E. department. 
But as Mr. Vitale puts it, "It had 
been ten years or so with the old 
administrative department, it was 
time for a "hange . 

Frank Vitale knows a lot about 
the old and the new at UCSD, 
though . He has been pall of the 
faculty since 1969. He Originally 
came here as a football coach, 
except in 1969 was also the year 
the school decided to 
discontinue its intercollegiate 
footbaU program . 

UCSD has betn his last stop 

after a somewhat long coaching 
career. However, before he was a 
coach, he was a coUege football 
player. A scholarship player for 
Cornell , he was small but very 
good lineman. He played football 
while he worked on his degree 
in Economics: When he finish~d 
playing collegiate football he 
finished his undergraduate work 
as well, receiving a bachelor's 
degree in Economics from the 
Ivy League School. 

After graduation it took a few 
years before he met up with 
college football again. In 1954 he 
landed an assistant coaching job 
at Columbia University. He has a 
satisfying tenure at the EaStern 
school. At the end of the 1950's, 
though , he left Cornell and the 
young coach decided [0 move it 
west, where he made a stOP at 
~an lJiego State, enjoying some 
good years with the relatively 
new football program. If your 

wondering about coaches 
cheatmg in recruitment of 
athletes, hc can assure you there 
was none of that with the Aztecs. 
It W.IS fairly obVIOUS by their 
rc( "rd 

Around the mid-1960's 
· Coach" Vitale would leave 
college football again. The next 
stop would be Miami , rlorida 
and a semi -professional team but 
soon after he called it quits. In 
1966 he stopped coaching all 
together. 

He may nOt coach football 
anymore, but Mr. Vitale is as 
involved in UCSD's athletic 
program as ever. It's not quite 
the same thing as running a 
team, but anyone can tell he 
enjoys it just the same. He is 
very interested in getting a 
footbaU team at UCSD, and you 
can be pretty sure there are a lOt 
of people here who would like to 
see him coach . Especially Frank 
~tak . ~ 

Vitale is new head oj PE's instructional branch.

Grounds for Murder is not 
a new film about the 
Southeast Asian Experience. 
[t is a San Diego bookstore 
that specializes in mysteries 
and other varieties of 
detective ficrion. For more 
than five years, it has occupied 
a space on the second floor of 
th e Old Town Mercado 
building on Congress Street, a 
few hundred yards from one 
of the oldest houses in San 
Diego, the Machad~Stewart 
House. Chronicles of the

A 
haunting 
house 
by amanda mcdonald 

Evil spirits and creatures 
invade the small courtyard 
and wander freely amongst 
the crowd of all ages to 
prepare for the eerie and 
frightening voyage through 
the Haunted Museum. Balboa 
Park's Museum of Man, 
which is holding its 13th 
annual "Haunted Museum," 
dubbed "Medival Mayhem," 
continues its terrifying 
tradition until Halloween 
night. 

To ensure that the crowd. 
gathered to witness this 
haunting event isjumpy, these 
ghouls, dressed in elaborate 
period clothing, slither up 
behind the unsuspecting and 
grab from out of -nowhere, 
with loud and shocking 
screams. These ghosts set the

--l'WOunds for lllurder 
well ~ informed staff of 
enthusiasts . 

Brown denies that she 
started the bookstore with the 
idea of competing with chain 
stores, Small individually~run 
bookstores cannot get the 
discounts that chain 
bookstores can get from 
publishers, so covering a 
specialty subject or "having 
really good service" is 

mood of terror for the 
frightening trip that awaits 
inside. The trip inside the 
museum not only includes the 
evils of the Medieval time 
frame, but also . has frights 
akin to the present day. 

The horror continues as the 
spook filled maze beckons to 
the brave souls in the crowd. 
Travelling through a grisly 
graveyard with roving corpses 
and shifting headstones, one 
finds way through a 
caveman's dark and gloomy 
lair .... Wandering slowly through 
hallways pulsating with strobe 
lights and also ones of utter 
darkness, the crowd 
eventually comes to the 
delectible gourmet feast 
where possessed phantoms 
munch hungrily on semi~ 

reali~tic human organs. The 
adventurous may accept an 
appetizer of an eyeball from a 
silver platter or perhaps, a 
tasty ear. 

"Medieval Mayhem" 
which is located in the 
Museum of Man. 1350 EI 
Prado, is open from 6:30~9:30 
pm. Admission is $3.50 for 
adults and $2 for children.

Serious mystery fans, like 

An 
irregular 
beat 

by dave forman and 
louise belford root 

All dressed up with no 
place to go on Halloween 
night? Try The Regular Guys 
at the Bacchanal. These boys 
are the tightest blues~rock 
band to play in San Diego in 
some time. Returning as 
headliners, The Regular Guys 
are guaranteed to provide 
three hours of the most foot~ 
stomping, energetic music 
that this city has seen, and it 
won't be possible to hear 
them without dancing. 

To call The Regular Guys 
merely danceable is a 
criminally understated term 
for their talents. Their music 
ranges from rockabilly to 
Badboy Blues, paying heed to 
almost every other musical 
tradition 'along the way. This 
band could play at a sixties 
sock hop or a seedy beer joint, 
and in either instance leave 
their audience satisfied. Their 
relentless drive makes you 
twist, hustle, or just plain 
strut your stuff, although 
their main appeal is their 
dance appeal. 

The Regular Guys are 
powered by all seven 
members of the band. Lead 
guitar player Roy Furshpan 
and bass player/lead singer 
Simply Dave started the band 
in Claremont, California in 
1983. Simply Dave is in 
control of the show most of 
the time, joking with the 
crowd and shamelessly 
promoting the band and their 
one album, Distressed. 
Meanwhile, Furshpan 
playfully jumps around the 
stage, frequently settling 
down into intense closed-eyed 
solos. Rick Sterbentz on 

serious fans ot any particular 
genre of artistic endeavor 
(such as science~fiction fans 
or punk rockers), tend to be 

close~knit, communicative, 
and openly supportive of the 
efforts ofleading practitioners 
in various ways. Brown, for 
example, publishes a 
quarterly newsletter for her 
customers, which contains a 
large number of short reviews 

keyboards belts out the blues 
numbers with expert 
;,lCcuracy. His lively barritone 
and creative jazz/ blues riffs 
help to define his character, as 
he slouches over his pi;lno 
top. engulfed in booze and 
cigarettes. Drummer Martin 
Maudal keeps a steady beat 
and offers interesting solos. 

The heart of the band is in 
their three~man horn section~ 
composed of Tim Clark, Sal 
Misquez and Terry Fritts. 
They are what truly sets The 
Regular Guys apart from most 
bands . As background 
musicians for the singers, they 
are subde and richly textured. 
As soloists, each masters his 
instrument, though no one is 
the star. They divide their 
solos and blend their passages 
like one player. The highlight 
of the live performance comes 
during a song called "Coke 
Snorting Woman," when the 
three sax players leave the 
stage and situate themselves in 
different areas of the club, 
trading off solos, and literally 
surrounding the audience 
with sound. 

of new or re~released books, 
information about authors 
and autograph parties at the 
store, and ir.cidental news or 
opinions. 

Grounds for Murder is a 
fun place to shop for books, 
for mysteries that the chain 
stores do not or cannot stock. 
It is a celebration of a genre, 
and of the concept that even 
avarice, jealousy, gluttony, 
lust, and chaos, even the 
darkest impulses of the 
human psyche can be put into 
writing for the purpose 
entertainment. 

For information, call 
294~9497 . 

Of their ambitions, Simply 
Dave jokes that he wants his 
name next to Mozart'S, but 
then comments, "What we're 
really trying to do is gain 
respectability as musicians." 
They have over an album's 
worth of new rna terial, and are 
eager to sign a contract and cut 
a second record. 

The truth behind their band 
name, Simply Dave explains, 
is that they tossed out 
hundreds of possible names, 
and picked the lesser of all 
evils. Though they decided on 
The Regular Guys, the name is 
clearly ironic, as regular guys 
do not make music like this. 
They will be in town 
tomorrow night (Halloween) 
as well as Saturday night at the 
Bacchanal in Clairemont, and 
it should prove to be another 
exciting night of good times 
and great music. Tne band 
promises to be in costume and 
urges those coming to do the 
same. Doors open at 8 pm and 
the show begins at 9:30. 
Cover is $3 . For more 
information, 560-8022. 



Music 
with a 
byte 

by seba8tian j. french 
To co:nmemorate Ameri~ 

can Music Week, SONOR, 
the USCD new music 
ensemble, will perform a 
concert on Wednesday, 
November 5. Among the 
pieces that will be played is 
" Diapason " by UCSD 
graduate student Paul 
Koonce, who was the first to 
receive the $9000 Maxwell 
and Muriel Gluck fellowship 
in composition. 

Koonce first studied and 
received a master's degree in 
composition at the University 

of Illinois. A piece he wrote, 
"Rule Ill," was a finalist in the 
Luigi Russolo International 
Electronic Music Competi~ 
tion in 1977, and appears on 
The University of Illinois 
Electronic Music Studios ' 

25th anniversary album. 
Soon afterward, he received 

a UC Regents fellowship to 
p~rsue a Ph.D. in composi~ 
tion at UCSD. Since that 
time. he has composed several 
other works. "Escape Tone," 
for solo flute, was performed 
,at the Darmstadt Summer 
Institute, and "Transient." a 

computer~aided piece, was 
performed at The Interna~ 
tiona 1 Computer Music 
Festival in Koriyama. Japan. 

Koonce's style is what he 
describes as, "the way I think 
about things." He has certain 
structures and systems for 
looking at the organization of 
sounds. He doesn't like doing 
the same thing twice, 
however, so his style isn't 
associated with a specific 
structure; it's all in the way he 
perceives the sound. 

UCSD is the only place in 
the U.S. with a Center of 
Music Experiment, and the 
main reason he enjoys 
studying at UCSD is because 
the music department is 
interested in new music 
techniques, whether they be 
novel approaches to an old 
instrument or computer~ 
aided compositions. 

His latest work, "Diapa~ 
son," is a melding of different 
instrumental sounds accom~ 
panying a constant piano 
melody. The SONOR 
concert, "Contempora ry 
Masterpieces, " will be held in 
the Mandeville Auditorium at 
8 pm. Tickets are $1 for 
students, faculty, and senior 
citizens, and $3 for general 
admission. 

A heart 
aching 
• Issue 

by 8u8ie heel 
Why did the United States 

government ignore the AIDS 
issue for two years while it 
reached epidemic propor~ 
tions? This is one of the many 
questions asked by The 
Normal Heart, a play by Larry 
Kramer which is currently 
playing at the North Coast 
Repertoiry Theatre. This play 
chronicles the beginnings of 
AIDS in New York City. and 
one man's attempt to alert the 
community and society to the 
disease and its ramifications. 

Doug Roberts, a graduate 
of UCSD, gives a superb 
performance as Ned Weeks, 
the main character who must 
combat people from all sides 
during his crusade. His 
frustration is felt in the futility 
of his actions. We wa tch as his 
electric tirades, which attempt 
to promote action, sink into 
despair when Felix, his friend 
and lover, contracts the 
disease with no cure in sight. 
Ned is played with such 
emotion and passion that the 
audience cannot help but 
sympathize, which makes this 
play work. The characters in 
this play are just norma! men 
who have normal jobs as 
writers and vice~presidents. 

. , 

! 

La-~ footJlo~ 
A "'(tlm"'," ~ O., ,, III'If'n'_j 

Bill Maass and DouglaJ Roberts in "TheNormal Heart. II 

and they also have normal 
hearts, which become 
anguished as friends continue 
to die. 

This play does not sugar 
coat issues. It does not set up 
gays as martyrs for their cause. 
In fact, the opposite can be 
seen. Ned forrns a council to 
help accomplish his goals, but 
this council disagrees with 
Ned on some very fundamen~ 
tal issues. It is clear to Ned 
that in order to try to curb this 
dangerous disease, gay men 
must stop having sex. but the 
council opposes Ned. and will 
not back him until there is 
factual evidence that the 
disease is spread through 
sexual contact. The message is 
clear that all the blame cannOt 
be placed on the government; 
the gay community did not 

help themselves. 
The Normal Heart has a very 
~rophetic air about it; many 
of the things about which Ned 
warns his friends have in fact 
come true, the most 
astonishing and horrifying of 
which is the reference Ned 
makes to the concentration 
camps in which he fears gays 
will be placed. With 
LaRouche's Proposition 64, 
this could actually become a 
reality. It appears that the 
fight for human rights is 

never~ending. 
This play points a lot of 

fingers. but not just at the 
government and the gay 
community. Fingers are also 
pointed at Ned for trying to 
destroy the freedom gays have 
been working so long to
