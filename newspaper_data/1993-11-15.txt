Fraternity Ban 
RIVERSIDE - Officials at 
UC Riverside have repealed 
Phi Kappa Sigma's three-year 
suspension from campus as 
part of an out-of-court 
settlement between UCR and 
the fraternity. The actions 
follow a recommendation 
from 'UC General Counsel. 
"'There were some First 
Amendment problems with 
the university's decision [to 
suspend the fraternity]," said 
General Counsel Eric K. 
Behrens. Phi Kappa Sigma 
was banned from campus by 
the university in October for a 
rush t-shirt that many Chicano 
groups considered racist. On 
Oct. 20, the fraternity filed 
suit against UCR, claiming 
that the university had violated 
the fraternity's constitutional 
rights.

Union Protests U'se of Grants 
By JonnII P8Imer 
Associate News Editor 

1be University Professional and Technical 
Employees (UPTE), a union formed for re-
search employees and staff, has begun a letter-
writing campaign to protest the use of surplus 
federal research grant funds which they claim 
are going to pay for capital improvements. 

UPTE became concerned when employ-
ees whose salaries are funded by grants learned 
that they would have to take a pay cut along 
with staff members whose salaries are paid 
out of the California state budget. In July, a 
meeting was held between representatives of 
UPTE and UCSD Labor Relations to find out 
how the money saved by the salary cuts would 
be spent. 

According to UCSD's UPTE organizer 
Daniel Martin, who requested ~he meeting. 
"We wanted an explanation as to what would 
happen with the surplus." 

Martin said UPTE discovered that the 
money would be used neither to help re-
duce the university'S budget deficit nor for 
staff funding, since that would violate the 
Office of the President's policy. Instead, 
UPTE was told by the Labor Relations 
representatives that the savings from the 
pay cuts would probably be used to pur-
chase new equipment. 

Assistant Director of the Office of Con-
tracts and Grant Administration Linda Dale 
said that UC policy required salaries to be 
slashed across the board, regardless of whether 
the salaries were funded by the state budget or 
by research grants. "All the employees have 
to be tteated the same. You cannot charge the 
government more than you charge somebody 
else," Dale said. "As a matter of practice, the 
money is re-shuffled as needed. "You have to 
go by agency rebudgeting," she added. 

Dale acknowledged that not allocating the 
money toward deficit reduction or employee 
salaries may be seen as a detriment to university 
employees, but added, "there isn't any legal way 
you can do that" 

Manin said that UPTE lawyers had found 
no legal basis for applying funds originally 
:lll ncated for staff salaries to capital improve-
r l(,Il\S . such as equipment purchases. 

\ ' ;I ~ti n also pointed out that for the first 
lime III University of California history, em-
ployees were feeing a benefit decrease. Mar-
tin said that the loss of benefits and the recent 
3.5 percent pay cut could cause employees to 
seek employment outside die university. 

"Our sense from this campus is ... they can't 
afford to lose people. [But], it's actually more 
attractive to go to the outside [now]. You had

County Cuts 
Funding T~ 
Med Center 
BUDGET: UCSD ho pital ab orb 
the costs of providing medical 
care to illegal immigrant 
By Francisco DeVries 
Senior Staff Writer 

In a move that will cO!o.tthe CSD Medical 
Center over $5 million next year. the an 
Diego Board of Supervi~or~ vOled la,1 Tues-
day to stop paying the emergency medical 
COSIS for illegal immigrallls tre:lled al the uni-
versi ty hospital. 

County officials esti mate I hat nearl y hal f of 
the $10.8 million to be reimbursed to the uni-
versity this year was for illegal residents of San 
Diego County. The Board of Supervisor. voted 
to continue to pay for the medical costs of 
indigent people who are legal residents, as pan 
of a 10-year contract between the county and 
the University of California. 

The Medical Center ha announced that it 
will continue to treat illegal residents and absorb 
the costs itself. UCSD Medical Center Director 
of Government, Contracts and Physician Rela-
tions Jan Spencley said in .1 statement released 
last week that the "UCSD Medical Center, just 
as every hospital with an emergency room, has 
both a legal and a moral obligation to treat 
anyone requiling emergency treatment." 

According to universi ty ources, the Medi-
cal Center has lost $50 million in the past year 
from patient who have not paid their bills. To 
offset the losses, the Medical Center has initi-
ated a$70 million cost-cutting program. which 
includes streamlining through early retirement 
and other cutbacks. 

With the cut incounty funding to the Medical 
Center, which includes both the university hos-
pital at Hillcrest and the new Thornton Hospital 
at UCSD, the universi ty is still expecting a 
deficit of over $3 million at the end of the next 
fiscal year in June. 

Spencley said that the $5 million cu t by the 
county will require the Medical Center to re-
duce costs in other areas of the hospital's 
system of care and will "hinder our ability to 
fund replacement equipment and 10 invest in 
new services and technology." 

She added that while the government may 
choose to cut the funding for the treatment of 
non-residents, "it i. inappropriate toexpect the 
Univer ity of California to fund them ." 

County Supervisor Pam Slater agreed that 
the university should not be asked to foot the

Momentum Editors File Grievance With Judicial Affairs 
By PhIlIp MIe ...... 

. ,.. Editor 
1be editors of Momentum, the 

Associated Students-funded pub-
lication for Asian Americans and 
Pacific Islanders, have filed a 
grievance with the Judicial Af-
fain Office against the students 
who removed 2,000 copies of the 
newspaper's latest issue. 

Director of Special Services 
, NicholuAguilardeclinedtocom-

ment on the Momentum case, say-
ing that he was unable to talk about 

specific cases that may be under 
review. However, Aauilar did in-
dicate that his qffice would be 
responsible for investigating the 
charges. 

"Judicial Affairs [will] review 
and process any complaints filed 
by students against other students 
or student organizations," Aguilar 
said. 

On Nov. 3, halfof Momentum's 
circulation of 4,000 copies had 
been stolen within an hour of dis-
tribution at sites across campus, 

according to Momentum Editor in 
Chief Joanne Tashiro. Several of 
Momentum's editors reported that 
they had seen individuals remov-
ing entire stacks of the newspaper. 

According to Tashiro, students 
also defaced a sign that Momen-
tum members hung up in the old 
Student Center. 

Aguilar would not comment on 
whether removing the issues con-
stituted a theft, adding that he did 
not have the opportunity to review 
the specifics of the case. Last week, 

A.S. Media Advisor Randy 
Woodard said that the perpetrators 
had committed a theft when they 
removed the MomentulII i sues. 

The controver. y stems from an 
article in MomentulII entitled "A 
Little 'Mail ,''' which took a ste-
reotypical look at Asian-Ameri-
can males. The students who re-
moved Ihe stack . aid that the ar-
ticle was raci I and sexi. t and that 
it reinforced stereot ypes. 
MomentulII 's editors defended the 
piece a. a satire.

software from scratch." 

At the touch of a bUllon, UCSD 
students can gain access to a number 
of services and infonnation through 
a new telephone infonnation sys-
tem which began operating Nov. 2. 

After four years offormulating 
software and getting fil]ancial sup-
port, the College Club crew ap-
proached the A.S. 

Director of Development Wally 
Lockwood said that he had already 
looked into other types of infonna-

Co-sponsored by the Associ-
ated Students and a group ofUCSD 
students and 
alumni, College 
Club is intended to 
give students a new 
way to access in-
formation pertinent 
to campus life. 

Information on 
events and depart-
ments, as well as a 
voice mail service, 
will be available 
through the Col-
lege Club tele-
phone lines.

tion systems, but the 
complexity of the 
College Club sys-
tem impressed him. 

" The A.S. 
Council had al-
ready been looking 
toward an infonna-
tion-type system 
which, compared 
to this, was 
minute," 
Lockwood said. 

The A.S. Coun-
cil, in a straw poll 
vote last month, 
unanimously 
agreed to sponsor 
College Club. 
Sincethen,accord-
ing to Lockwood, 
the council has 
supported it 
"wholeheartedly. " 

College Club's 
founders called 
upon their back-
grounds in eco-
nomics, computer 
science and psy-
chology to set up 
the system, which 
is the first of its 
kind, according to 
co-founder and 
current Muir Col-
Jege senior Michael 
Cposti. 

-Michael Cpostl 

The College 
Club's voice mail 
boxes have been on 

College Club Co-Founder line for almost two 

" We are unaware of anything 
like this or similar to it anywhere, 
not only in thecolJege market but in 
any industry," Cposti said. 

According to Cposti, the idea 
for College Club stemmed from 
an overall lack of communication 
between students and the services 
and businesses on and around cam-
pus. After doing some market re-
search, College Club's founders 
disccvered that college students 
are an appealing group to busi-
nesses because they control 51 
percent of the discretionary spend-
ing - the money spent after the 
essentiaJs offood, rent and tuition 
- in the United States. 

"We felt that if all the busi-
nesses around campus want these 
customers so badly, maybe we can 
find a way to help the communica-
tion process," Cposti said. 

"The reason why someone 
hasn't done this before ... is that it 
would be extremely expensive to 
get something like this [to work], 
and then, college students change," 
Cposti added. "You'd have to scrap 
a system like this every few years, 
and it would be a big problem. It 
would be very costly and it 
wouldn't make sense. So we de-
cided that in order to do something 

weeks now, and the 
student response has been very posi-
tive, according to Cposti. The per-
sonal college voice boxes will give 
students access to information con-
cerning campus-related events, in-
cluding departmental information, 
c1assifieds and textbook exchange. 
Extra information lines concerning 
news, sports and weather are also 
included in the College Club service. 

These services are being acti-
vated one at a time, since the sys-
tem is still in its first days of opera-
tion. For example, textbook ex-
change services will not be avail-
able until Winter Quarter. 

To get hooked up to the system, 
students pay a $2.94 voice box fee, 
which has been waived until Win-
ter Quarter in order to introduce 
students to the system. At the sug-
gestion of Director of UCSD Fi-
nancial Services Thomas Rudder, 
financial aid is available to stu-
dents who cannot afford this fee. 

College Club is supported by 
the services and businesses which 
buy time on its information lines, 
in addition to the voice box fee. In 
the future, the founders hope to 
eliminate this fee and become en-
tirely supported by the businesses, 
so all students can have access to 
the system.

UCSD Hosts Two Russian Artists 
UCSD's Center for Research in Computing and the 

Arts (CRCA) was selected to host two Russian artists, 
according to CRCA Director Harold Cohen. The monthÂ· 
long residencies, which began on Wednesday of last 
week. were made possible through the ArtsLink Pro-
gram of the Citizen's Exchange Council of New York 
City. 

The residency participants. video artist Gia Rivava 
of Moscow and architect Boris Tarasov of Nizhny 
Novgorod, were chosen from a field of more than 200 
applicants from 17 countries in Central and Eastern 
Europe. 

â¢ Arrangements have been made for Rivava and 
Tarasov to meet with professionals in their fields here 
in San Diego and to gain exposure in the use of new 
technologies,Â· Cohen said. 

While in residence, Rivava will present his work 
and the works of other contemporary Russian video 
artists at 8 p.m. on Thursday, DeC. 2 at the Cafe 
Cinema, located at 1602 Front Street in downtown 
San Diego. 

As part of his residency, Tarasov will attend the 
UCSD School of Architecture's design workshops 
through November, and presentations at CRCA and 
the New School of Architecture in San Diego. Tarasov 
also has been invited to intern at the architectural firm 
of Tucker Sadler to witness applications of computerÂ· 
aided design in all phases of architectural planning 
and implementation. 

CRCA will arrange personal Interviews for the art-
ists with area arts and cultural organizations to estab-
lish a base network for Mure collaborations between 
Russia and the United States. 

The ArtsLlnk program was formed In 1992 as a 
partnership of public and private entities of the 
Citizen Exchange Council, the National Endowment 
for the Arts, the Open Society Fund-Soros Centers for 
Contemporary Art and the Trust for Mutual Under-
standing. 

ArtsLink Residencies enables federal nonprofit 
arts organizations to host artists and art managers 
from Central and Eastern European countries, includ-
ing Russia and the Baltics.

CALPIRG Sponsors Beach Clean-up 
EVENT: Fifteen bags of garbage 
collected at La Jolla Shores 
By EUzabetb Mackenzie 
Guan1lan Reporter 

The cold weather on Saturday morning did not 
deter 45 UCSD sludents from gathering at La Jolla 
Shores for a beach clean-up sponsored by the campus 
chapter of California Public Interest Research Group 
(CALPIRG). 

The event coincided with the highest and lowest 
tides of the year. The tides, combined with Friday's 
rains, caused ample debris to wash up on shore. This 
meant conditions were perfect for a "major beach 
clean-up day," according to an enthusi~tic Abigail 
Storke, a Muir College junior and an organizer with 
CALPIRG.

Bulldozers cleared away excess sand and sea-
weed that had washed up to the beach's seawall, 
while the UCSD students, armed with trash bags 
and tally sheets, scouted the beach for trash. "It's a 
mess," said Revelle College senior Luciano Sanchez 
as the clean-up began. Fifteen bags were collected 
during the three-hour clean-up. 

Students used the tally sheets, which were pro-
vided by the Center for Marine C;onservation (CMC), 
to record the types of trash they collected. That data 
will be used by the CMC to determine the sources of 
the garbage. During the clean-up, students found 
litter ranging from plastic bottle caps to cigarette

butts and shoes. 
Warren College sophomore Russell Gulman said 

that clean beaches and water is just one of the many 

issues with which CALPIRG is concerned . 
CALPIRG, a statewide student-run organization, 
focuses on environmental issues that affect consum-
ers, including recycling, endangered species and 
ancient forests . According to Storke, the UCSD 
chapter has 20 core members and 300 other students 
who are involved in CALPIRG activities. 

HEALTH: 
County will not pay 
non-resident's bills 
Continued from .,... 1

and added, "I think this is a federal 
problem." She said that the federal 
government determines border 
policy and should be willing to 
accept the consequences of that 
p<;Ilicy, which in this case includes 
the payment of legally required 
medicaJ care. 

According to Slater, in slightly 
over a decade the county has paid 
out $57 million to cover the costs of 
indigent care at UCSD, $42 million 
of which went to undocumented 
workers. "We cannot be asked to 

subsidize the heaJth care for other 
countries," she said. 

Slater added that the issue of ser-
vices for illegal immigrants has riled 
taxpayers for some time, but that it 
"is being much more closely looked 
at because of the [budget] crisis." 

County Health Services, which 
does not run its own county hospi-
tal, has contracted with the univer-
sity to provide care for indigent 
patients since 1966 when thefonner 
San Diego County General Hospi-
tal was leased to the university. 
UCSD purchased the hospital out-
right in 1981. 

The county has announced that it 
will use the savings in other areas of 
health care services for uninsured 
county residents who are not cov-
ered by Medi-CaJ.

With as much as 80 percent

have been affected by the sal-
ary reduction. As a result, the 
UPTE letter-writing campaign 
has gained significant support 
from both union and non-union 
members. " We've already sent 
over 100 [letters]. UC needs to 
be held accountable and it's 
very resistant to that, " Marti n

THE SOLUTION TO THE 
THEFf OF MOMENTUM'S 
ISSUES IS SIMPLE - THE 
PERPETRATORS SHOULD 

BE LED OFF IN SHACKLES 
By BEN BOYClmK 
Senior luff Wriler 

The scenario is beginning to sound like 
an overplayed record. A university newspa- . 
per publishes a controversial article. a small 
but vocal minority is offended. and sud-
denly. as ifby magic. the offending publica-
tion disappears from campus. 

But it 's not a magic trick. It's theft. 
More and more. such thefts are occur-

ring on college campuses across the coun-
try from Pennsylvania to Wisconsin to 
Florida, all the way to San Diego. Every-
where. the self-appointed arbiters of the 
public good are ensuring. by hook or by 
crook, that their campus publications are 
"fit for di tribution" - free of racism, sex-
ism and other affronts to the prevailing 
onhodoxy. In many cases, such thefts have 
gone uncondemned and unpunished by timo-
rous administrators who often mumble 
something about "conflicting values" and 
amble on to other mundane tasks. 

It was only a matleroftime before some 
perpetually oppressed group decided to 
make UCSD safe for diversity by plunder-
ing the newspaper racks. Thus. it came as 
little surprise when I learned that a small 
group of outraged Asian-American men 
seized more than 2.000 copies of the latest 
i sue of Momentum and unceremoniously 
deposited them in the trash.

No reasonable person would argue that 
five men needed to take more than 2.000

the Guardian than the New York Times is.

and simple. A publication should be able to

COMMENTARY 

THE EDITORS OF MO-

FOR RUNNING THE 
STORY, BUT THO E WHO 

REMOVED THE ISSUES 
WERE EVEN SLOPPIER 

B~ DA \'10 ''''el l\" 
~lIil)r . Iliff 1,\ ril('" 

At the root of the incident in which 
Momentulll copi es were discarded i 
laziness - laziness on the pan of the 
writer of the article in question, on the 
part of the M OJll ellluJII editor. and on 
the part of the offended male who 
dumped 2,000 issues in the garbage. 

I read "A Little 'Mail'" (after 
searching hard for a remaining copy) 
and found it offensive. A careful 
reading reveals that the author. 1\')' 
Lee. had intended the piece to be a 
sarcastic refutation of Asian male 
stereotypes. and she is no doubt ve ry 
distraught that her wriling could be 
interpreted any other way. The 
problem is that it is a poorly written 
parody, sarcasti c to the point of 
le.aving the author'S motive and 
subject in question. After a quick firs t 
reading, which i ~ how Illost people 
read newspaper articles. the reader is 
left wondering to what ex tent the 
author is attacking stereotype . and to 
what extent she is simply milk ing 
them for the sake of a good laugh. 

The author sarcastically adopts the 
voice of a bigot. and proceeds to 
describe in painful detai I every single 
stereotypical characteristic att ributed 
to Asian men. She then mentions 
famous Asian mel) who do not fit 
these stereotype (short. slight. 
unathletic) but di smi sse them ll . mere 
exceptions. 

In reality, just mentioning a few 
movie stars and ath letes is not an 
adequate refutation of the description 
offered in the anicle. If the writer wa. 
willing to devote so much energy to 
vividl) describing a bigot's view of 
Asian men. she should have done 
more to obliterate th i. image than to 
merely mention Brandon Lee. 

Even if the policy of M OJll enfl11ll 
really is to publi sh anything they 
recei ve. it is still the job of the editor 
to make sure that the writer" s pub-
lished pieces accurately portray the 
writer's intention. If the parody was 
meant to be aimed against bigots, then 
the editor better be sure that it is the 
bigots who will be offended. 

In any case. it is not the place of an 
outside party to decide when or how 
much another individual should be 
offended.Tf a large group of Asian men 
were highly offended by the article. it 
is not their fault for miSS ing the 
subtleties of the parody. The anger is 
legitimate. 

Now comes the tricky business of 
responding to the offense. In the case of 
the Momentum incident, stealinl!

WAS IT RACISM OR SATIRE?/ READERS SPEAK OUT ON MOMENTUM 
Editor: 

The article written by Ivy Lee in 
M~nttun not only is a weak ex-
cuse for male bashing. bul portrays 
a derogatory image of Asian Ameri-
cans as a whole. Although I have 
heard that this article was supposed 
to be humorous. the article only 
reaffirms such misconceptions of 
the stereotypical Asian male. 

We live in a nation in which 
communities are trying desperately 
to break the color and gender lines. 
the author of this article perpetuates 
such stereotypical ignorance and 
makes the jobs of those individuals 
interested in breaking such color 
lines much harder. I do not know the 
purpose of Mom~ntum, but if it is to 
raise awareness of the Asian-Ameri-
can culture. this article does not 
serve such a purpose, but brings 
about more i:;norance among people 
of non-Asian descent.

Not the Answer 
Editor: 

As an Asian American. I, too, 
was deeply offended. appalled and 
disgusted to find such a tasteless 
article in Mo~ntum. However. the 
whole point of having a variety of 
campus media is to provide diverse 
viewpoints and opinions. 

Instead of trashing copies of Mo-
~nrum. those individuals should 
have taken a positive action to break 
down the stereotype they were of-
fended by. leiters to the editor or 

town meetings are a few ways to 
bring people together and commu-
nicate in order to confront the ste-
reotypes. Instead of leaving indi-
viduals in the dark by preventing 
them from reading whole publica-
tions, unacceptable attitudes should 
be publicly scrutinized. Eliminat-
ing the expression of divisive ste-
reotypes through vandalism does 
nothing but allow these stereotypes 
to prosper in silence. 

Every one of our campus media 
has a right to be heard by the stu-
dents. Every sludent has a right to 
read or disregard each one of the 
media. No one has any right to take 
that decision away. 

BlkÂ·Na Park

Paper De.erv .. 
Apology for Act 
Editor: 

When constitutional principles 
are violated, Asian Americans 
should be concerned. In 1942. the 
U.S. government violated the con-
stitutional rights of approximately 
120.000 Japanese Americans by 
placing them in concenlnltion camps 
under the pretense that it was "for 
their own protection." David Lee 
and those who think like him have 
violated Momentum â¢ s constitutional 
right to freedom of the press osten-
sibly "for the protection oflhe Asian-
American community." The ulti-
mate issue here is the constitutional 
question. not the inflammatory side 
issue of racism and sexism. 

In a special Readers' 
Forum, the UCSD 
campus responds to the 
debate surrounding 
Momentum and the 
removal of 2,000 copies 
of its latest issue. 

Second. Lee excuses his behav-
ior by claiming that Momentum is a 
"racist and sexist publicalion." a 
point he relentlessly grinds to direct 
attention away from his constitu-
tionalfauxpas. Legal scholars who 
reviewed the latest issue of Momen-
tum conclude that while certain ar-
ticles might be offensive to a small 
minority of the Asian-American 
community. it is neither a racist or 
sexist publication. For those further 
interested in these issues, we would 
suggest reading legal scholar Mari 
J. Muatsuda's Words that Wound: 
Critical Race Theory, Assaultive 
Speech. and the First Amendment. 

Third, Lee proudly flaunts the 
fact the he is a founding member of 
Mom~ntum. When the publication 
ceased to fulfill his own personal 
agenda and became an open forum 
for discussing Asian-American and 
Pacific Islander issues. Lee labels 
the paper racist and attempts to pre-

The Staff of Momentum 

Another Display 
Of Stupidity 
Editor: 

Once again J am amazed by yet 
another display of immense stupid-
ity at UCSD. By trashing 2,000 cop-
ies of Momentum , students called 
tremendous attention to an issue they 
were trying to keep people from 
reading. If they h:\d si mply left it 
alone, no one. other than the Mo-
mentum staff. would have read the 
anicle. 

Contrary to the Guardian's ludi -
crous assertion that "Momentum has 
a circulation of 4,000 readers," it 
has a circulation of 4.000 copies, 
which are left in the racks until suf-
ficiently weathered to be hauled off 
by a maggot-infested Recycli ng Co-
op member. Next time. these aveng-
ers of the offended should think 
before they act.

Newspaper Theft 
Was Cowardly 
Editor: 

The most disturbing thing about 

thi s incident is the actions of censor-
ship against M omen/IIIII. 

Those who removed the MOInell-
IlIIII issues did so despite the fac t 
that the other contents of th is i~sue 
were of great importance to Asian 
Americans, being about thing~ ~uc h 
as AIDS in the Asian <.:ommu nity. 
and the monumental achievement 
of The Joy Lllck Cluh motion pic-
ture. the first full-production movie 
written, directed, produ<.:cd and ~ta rÂ­
ring Asian Americans. By attempt-
ing to censor two pieces they did not 
like , th ese thie ves censored 
MQmentulII' s attrmpt to document 
other things important to the Asian 
community. 

These thi eves did not even at-
tempt to approach M lIIllC'11I1I1II ~tntT 
on the subject of the! article. They 
simply assumed the nature of the 
anicle and acted il11m:tlll rely. If I 
find someone spreading lie~ abo ut 
me. I would il t lea,t have Ihe b,tlb to 
approach them about it. If the art ic le 
was such a pack of lie, and hate. 
wouldn ' t it be better to show the 
M Olll e1lf1l1ll staff their error by re-
spondi ng to the article in the next 
issue rather than underhandedly at-
te mpting 10 steal copie, or the pa-
per? 

I have a fee ling th at perhaps 
these ind ividuals are not ,ecure 
enough in their ide nt ity to be ab le 
to take any criticism (el'en if it is 
meant as sarcasm) anti that they 
conspire on Iy bt!cau,e they are

LAZY: Debate 
should focus on 
issue, not censorship 
ContInued from ..... 4 
the issues was effective in tenns of 
demonstrating that these men, in 
particular members of Lambda Phi 
Epsilon. were unwilling to take 
abuse sitting down. 1beir extrem-
ism was justified, bul the method 
they chose to demonstrate their ex-
treme anger could have been better. 
Censorship is a rather lazy exercise, 
and unpopular to boot 

From a publicity standpoint, the 
newspaper dumpers run the risk of 
diverting attention away from a 
pressing issue. the status and image 
of Asian males and toward the eterÂ· 
nal issue of censorship. Surely the 
members of Lambda Phi Epsilon, 
and all concerned parties, for that 
malter. do nOi want the ensuing de-
bate to dwell on this distraction. 

Censorship is also the most intel-
lectually lazy way to counter an 
opinion you don't like. The mental-
ity is. "Me not like, me destroy." 
Granted, writing letters to the edi-
tors of the Guardian and Momen-
tum is not very effective. People 
read the letter. and before turning 

the page think, "Oh, everybody al-
ways complains." But to hide the 
offending view from the public lacks 
creativity and doesn't make the prob-
lem go away. Aside from this. it is in 
this case against law. 

Those who stole the newspapers 
could have done something just as 
extreme and radical without raising 
the ugly spectre of censorship. How 
about taking over the Momentum 
office? 

The Guardian would gladly over-
publicize such an event. If enough 
people could be mobilized to haul 
all 2,000 issues into the garbage, 
there should be enough energy to 
organize a demonstration of some 
sort. 

(f the proposed public forum on 
the issue works out, then all that 
anger and energy will be going in the 
right direction. Sadly, however, thi 
issue might not have gotten the dis-
cussion it is now enjoying had the 
actions ofrhe issue dumpers not been 
as extreme as they were. I feel they 
could have attracted the same kind 
of attention through a less problem-
aric type of action . And hopefully, 
the resultant forums and discussions 
will focus not on an isolated incident 
of petty censorship, but on the issue 
that motivated it.

Continued from page 4 
ociety is the capaci ty to differenti -

ate between uncivilized ideas and 
oncivilized acts. Yet today we live 
in a society that considers insensi-
tive remarks a criminal offense but 
cannot see fit to convict a man for 
bashing another in the head wi th a 
brick. If this trend continues, I ex-
pect the legiSlatures wi ll soon re-
vive the old English offense ofimag-
ining the King' sdeath. and the courts 
will send men to prison for thinking 
unhappy thoughts. 

Â· "[Momelltlllll Editor in Chief] 
Joanne Tashiro and [Managing Edi-
tor] James Chou do not even know 
the cOllseqllellces of atire and

r think it would be safer to say 
that Ta hiro and Chou are a little 
vague on what good sut ire and 
parody are supposed to be. A for 
the consequences, [ don' t think the 
Ko(,{a i~ especially funny, but you 
don't ee me and my friends heav-

about the consequences of an un-
punished theft than of a bad peice of 
Writing. 

Â· "Satire and parody promote self-
hatred for the Oriental male." 

If the offending article promotes 
self-hatred for the Oriental male. I 
would respectfully sugge 't that the 
Oriental male obtain the services of 
a good pyschotherllpisl. 

Â·"Just look at the facts: the editor 
in chief i a fema le - how can she 
possibly be in touch with and sensi-
tive to males?" 

At this point, r began to wonder 
whether this mystery letter was not 
itself a sub-par effort at satire and 
parody. 

Â·"James Chou is a wimp." 
I do not know Mr. Chou, so I will 

refrain from making any rash judg-
ments. But if, in fact , Mr. Chou is a 
wimp, I think he might have a case 
for "fighting words" against this 
fellow . And in the current climate, 
he might just win.

sixth Amendment not extending the 
franchise to IS-year-olds. But that

As always. he is unable to discuss 
any specific case, or even whether 
charges have been or will be filed 
(they have). All he can do is inves-
tigate the allegations and decide 
whether any violations have oc-
curred, then pass his findings on to 
the relevant college deans. 

I fear now that the stigma of 
racism has been raised. the adminis-
tration will be inclined to back. off 
ratherthan be accused of condoning 
"hate literature" or some such non-
sense. 

Kaplan finds 
Inagic formula. 

The campus powers that be have 
remained mostly silent thus far, 
which is not encouraging, given 
what we know about the silence of 
administrators at other campuses 
where such thefts have occurred in 
the past. Only student government 
advisor Randy Woodard has taken a 
vocal stand so far. (n a rare on-the-
record statement, Woodard agreed 
that talcing the papers. as Lee and 
his cohorts did, was theft and there-
fore a violation of the Student Con-
duct Code. 

But this is one case where the 
administration cannot afford to be 
weak. What campus authorities face 
is not some obscure contlict of val-
ues, but a clear case of theft in ' an 
effort to suppress an unpopular idea. 
And theft. no mailer what the rea-
son, cannot go unpunished. 

Again. 
Proof that 

no one knows tests 
like Kaplan: 

Kaplan has found a pattern behind GRE Pattern Identification questions-a way 
for you to get them right nearly every time . In seconds. Even if you don 't understand 
the question. And because the method works best on harder questions , you have 
more time to work on Ihe easy ones. 

But Director of Student Services 
Nicholas Aguilar, the custodian of 
the student conduct code, has taken 
his familiar noncommittal stance. 

But let the punishment fit the 
crime. For my part. I believe the 
perpetrators at the very least de-
serve a smack on the hands -with a 
sledgehammer.

Stripping Away 

cwas: Female college students moonlight as exotic 
dancers to make money and achieve artistic fulfillment 

By Gina Frueh! 
Guardian Reporter 

H s the music thumped over the loudspeakers, the dancer took the stage to the cheers of the crowd. Twice the spot-light caught her face, her 
gently closed eyes and confident 
smile. "I enjoy what I do, I like to 
entertain. Anytime someone is 
exhilarated by you, it's approval 
and it's fulfilling," she said_ 

These are the words of a nude 
dancer, a woman who makes large 
sums of money by dancing pro-
vocatively in front of an audience_ 
This attitude is certainly not un-
usual in the nude entertainment 
indusuy. 

But what separates this dancer 
from others is that she is also a 
student and there are many more 
like her. 

Exotic dancing may be an at-
tractive job to students because of 
its notably high wages, flexible 
and infrequent shifts lind the f~w 
specific skills required. At most 
clubs, the only requirements to be 
a dancer are that a person be at 
leasl 18 and possess a nude 
entertainer's permit. College-age 
women do make up a fair percent-
age of the dancers in local nude 
bars_ For example, eight out of20 
female employees at The Body 
Shop. a San Diego club, are col-
lege students, said a member of 
the Body Shop's management_ 

According to Candace 
Bushnell, a writer for Mad~nwiÂ­
s~lI~ magazine, many of the 
women working as topless or nude 
dancers today are college students 
or graduates who strip because of 
the potential for high earnings, 

''The stereotype of a drug ad-
dict dancing in a seedy club has 
been replaced with a wholesome 
but equally disturbing image -
that of a beautiful young woman, a 
college student or even a college 
graduate, taking advantage of an 
opportunity to make a lot of cash," 
Bushnell said_ 

Contrary to Bushnell' 5 claim 
that stripping is degrading and 
money-oriented. one student strip-
per said that although many strip-
teasers work solely for the money. 
tshe and other performers pursue 
it as a form of artistic expression. 

Fifth College sophomore 
Phillip Cole, who has several fe-
male friends who work as nude 
dancers, agreed that not all strip-
pers are in it for the money. 

''They see it as their choice. an 
expression of what they do and an 
expression almost of their femi-
ninity. Some of them actually con-
siderit quite artistic, too," he said. 
He added that his friends are com-
fortable with their jobs and do not 
feel that it degrades them to take 
their clothes off in front of an 
audience. 

However, the salaries thaulanc-
ers command are variable. 1be

FEHTURES 
amount of money an exotic dancer 
makes is sporadic because it is 
largely dependent on the tips she 
gets from customers, While a man-
ager at The Body Shop estimates 
that a confident. fit, good-looking 
dancer can make between $300 
and $400 in one eveningl one 
dancer said that this is an optimis-
tic guess, 

"Some evenings reflect this fig-
ure, but it's not guaranteed, You 
might walk away with not much 
more than 10 dollars," she said. 
"Like sales, it depends on how you 

package yo~self." she added. 
The poten~aI for making large 

sums of money exists, however. 
and according to Bushnell, some 
dancers make up to $150,000 per 
year of vinually tax-free income. 
a salary comparable to that of a 
very successful college graduate_ 
However. questions about the eth-
ics and morality of a career in 
stripping remain. 

"Some may argue that it's an 
illegitimate profession. of using 
sexuality SO make money," Cole 
said. "At the same time, it could be 
seen as a strike out for women's 
independence because not so long 
ago, women weren â¢ t even aloud to 
wear swimsuits like you see on the 
beach today_"

NUDE: Students 
moonlight as strippers 
for extra money 
Continued from page 9 

According to Cole, stripping is 
a legitimate way to make money, 
and his friends have every right to 
do it. "To make that kind of 
money, most people have to go to 
college for eight years," he said. 
"But that's the money they make. 
and if that ' s how they make it, it 's 
all right." 

Bushnell sees things differ-
ently. "No matter how easily top-
less dancing seems to have been 
accepted by our mass culture, the 
basic issue remains: topless danc-

ers are selling their bodies," he 
said. 

"Although this Illay be our God-
given right. .. there is still some-
thing morall y disturbi ng about 
women who take advantage of the 
si tuation:' Bushnell added. 

Cole added that he think~ his 
fr iends nre justified in their job, 
because they are usi ng their earn-
I ngs to supplement the cost of their 
college educat ions. 

"They know they don ' t want 
to be strippers all their life, it' sjust 
something they' re doing in the 
meantime. If anything, the fact 
that they' re stripping as a mode of 
paying for education says that they 
have a dri ve to further their educa-
tion," Cole said.

KEN 

PEHLMOn 
Silly Sports 
Announcers 
Spewing Stats 

Those who know sports, or like 
to think they do, are on a never-
ending quest to fill their minds with 
facts, figures, and statistics. They 
watch games on TV or read about 
them in the paper, absorbing infor-
mation about their favorite teams 
with a fervor that might only be 
equaled by a William 'The Refrig-
erator" Perry feeding frenzy. 

Of course, most of these figures 
are pointless, but they're great for 
impressing friends at parties. 

Network sponsors and executives 
alike drool over bumedout, washed-
up NFL linemen and quarterbacks 
who spew useless jargon smoother 
than a Wayne Gre\zky hat trick or 
over-analyze every possible situa-
tion with the flamboyance of a Den-
nis Rodman haircut. 

Anyone watching Saturday'S 
Notre Dame-Aorida State battle for 
the nation's number-one ranking, 
for example, had the pleasure of 
listening to Todd Christiansen 
speculate over the condition of 
Charlie Ward's ribs or tell eager 
listener's of Lou Holtz's impressive 
record in games in which he has had 
two or more weeks to prepare. 

Nevermind that the game was 
probably Ward's last chance for a 
national championship or that he 
quite possibly didn't want to be 
smeared by four oncoming 315-
pound linemen who eat small ani-
mals for snacks, the ex-Raider is 
convinced that Ward's scrambling 
was the result of confidence and 
good health. 

Hell, I'd run like a madman too if 

w. SOCCER: 
UCSD falls in Final 

I were being chased by some Indi-
ana com-fed farm boy with the body 
of a Mac truck and the demeanor of 
Ted Bundy. 

Granted, sometimes useless sta-
tistics can be a lot of fun . What else 
could be more enjoyable than argu-
ing about which is larger, Marge 
Schott's brain or a pea? Personally. 
r d vote for the pea. but I digress .. . 

This weekend, the godfather of 
professional football. Don Shula, 
registered his 325th win. the most 
ever for any NFL coach. The avid 
sports statistician is quick to note 
that Shula and son Dave have tallied 
the most wins combined of any fa -
ther-son coaching team in history. 
Impress the guys with that at the 
next company picnic. . 

Of course, the stats nut will also 
be quick to add the footnote that 
Shu la' s wins include playoff victo-
ries, whereas Papa Bear Hallis' did 
not. 

Most of the time, however, an-
nouncers and their analyses are just 
plain annoying - one can only li s-
ten to George Foreman and lim 
Lamply talk about pork for so long 
during a world heavyweight cham-
pionship fight. And then of course, 
there's Tim MacCarver .. . 

Now, I won't deny that some 
statistics are vital to the world of 
sports. Weather and injury reports 
are the odds makers ' best friends and 
the serious gambler should always 
pay special attention before hand-
ing over large sums of cash to his 
favorite bookie. Failure to do so 
may result in a visit by two large 
Italians named Guido and Vinny. 

But those figures that I just don' l 
understand continue to loom omi-
nously. 

I'll give big money to anyone 
who can explain to me the signifi-
cance of red-tail bass fishing results 
in Ventura County or the impor-
tance of the chainsaw calibrations 
in the National Lumber Jack Cham-
pionships. 

Maybe Christiansen can explain 
it to me. If not, maybe I'll just look 
for Foreman.

Champion-
ships by 
qualifying at 
Saturday's 
Regionals in 
Prado Parle. 

On a day 
when the 
men turned 
in a disap-
pointing ef-
fort, the 
women came 
away with 

one of their best races of the year. 
Freshman Hilary Ferreira paved 

the way for the women. She nar-
rowly missed cracking the 19-
minute mark for the first time by 
finishing at 19:02 in the five-kilo-
meter race, giving her a second-
place finish overall. She barely 
edged out Triton teammate Karen 
Hinkle, who finished third with a 
time of 19:04. Chandra Boydstun 
ended up fourth, crossing the finish 
line at 19: 10. These women earned 
the praise of Head Coach Ted Van 
Arsdale for their efforts. 

"Hilary and Chandra worked re-
ally well together. They certainly 

Junior Karen Hinkle 
executed their game plan well. All 
the girls ran an excellent race," he 
said. 

The rest of the women's team 
had to scramble to recover from a 
key mistake midway through the 
race. Jessie Therriault. Laura Peck 
and Jane Zimmerman were running 
in a tight group. waiting to make 
their move in the latter stages of the 
race. The group waited too long to 
make its kick. and the runners were 
forced to make up for the time they 
had lost. 

Therriault turned on the after-
burners and managed to finish in 
12th-place (19:44). Meanwhi Ie, 
Peck and Zimmerman were passed 
by teammate Sara Lyn Ruffalo, 
whose personal best time of 20:03 
gave her 18th place in the event. 

Overall, the strong performance 
of the women's 1Â·2-3 group gave 
UCSO (38 points) an easy win over 
its closest competitor, Claremont-
Mudd-Scripps (55 points). By fin -
ishing in the top two, both teams 

earned invitations to the Nationals. 
Although J.J. Castner continued 

to prove that he is the best runner in 
the region and Scott Leon turned in 
a personal record, the men's team 
couldn't overcome Claremont-
MuddÂ·Scripps, whose 47 points 
barely nipped UCSO (48 points). 

Castner chalked up yet another 
first-place finish by completing the 
eightÂ· kilometer race with a time of 
25:25. 

"I felt much more relaxed this 
week. because there wasn't as much 
pressure on us. The competition 
wasn' (quite as tough," said Castner, 
who missed the course record by II 
seconds. 

Leon's time of 26: 17 was the 
highlight for the men. "Â£Leon) has 
steadily improved each week, and 
has narrowed the gap between 1.J. 
and himself. He handles the pres-
sure of the big race as well as any-
one," Van Arsdale said. 

As for the rest of the Tritons, the 
cohesive teamwork which was key 
to their successes at the Conference 
Finals two weeks ago didn't materi-
alize on Saturday. 

In that pack were Bryan Leek 
(26:30), John Walsh (26:31) and 
Mall Ringer (26:36), who finished 
11th, 12th and 14th, respectively. 

"Even though they were a little 
bit off, I think it was a good thing for 
the team. HopefulJy, we'll use this 
experience and realize that we can't 
have a letdown next week. It was 
beller to have an off-week this week 
than next week," Castner said. 

Even so, the Tritons accom-
plished what they set out to do -

A 

Rhodes Walton finished 29th In the eight-kilometer race in 27:39. 
qualify for the Nationals. 

Now it is off to Grinnell, Iowa 
for next Saturday's National Cham-
pionships. 

The Tritons will also be wel-
comed by cold weather. It has been 
between 28 and 32 degrees the past 
week, and snow is a possibility. 

Experience may also play an im-
portant factor in determining 
UCSO's fate, but Van Arsdale feels 
his Tritons can get by. 

"Sure, experience matters, and 

we don't have a lot of it with our 
young team. But sometimes there 
will be new guys who aren't fazed at 
all. and I think we have some of 
those types of people," he said. 

All eyes will be on Castner. who 
has a chance to establi sh himself 
amongst the nation ' s el ite. 

" I know they want me to fini h in 
the top 25, but I'm shooting for a top 
10 fini sh, and maybe even top five. 
I know [ can nll1 with anybody out 
there. I just have to do il. "

M. SOCCER: 
Curran's heroics put 
UCSD in Final Four 
Continued from .,..e 20 
missed adding another goal to his 
credit at 17:52. Robert Ripley beat 
his defender and crosSed a pass from 
the top right comer of the box to 
Romey, who promptly launched a 
screaming one-bouncer to the left of 
Keeley. Somehow, an off-balance 
Keeley got his right hand on the 
ball, slowing it enough to smother 
the attempt. 

The Triton defense, although a 
bit sloppy in the opening half,turned 
away several Roanoke runs at San 
Diego goalkeeper Michael Madden. 

Ken Bums anchored the defen-
sive effort. Nick Terlecky and Matt 
Chilton also came up big in crucial 
situations, most notably shutting 
down Roanoke's leading-scorers 
Dustin Fonder (64 points) and Andy 
Smith (34 points). 

Roanoke struck even at 71:34. 
Keith Amott led teammate Todd 
Hallauer to the left middle of the 
box. Hallauer looked to center the 
ball to the middle, . but ended up 
skyrocketing the pass toward the 
left post. Bums tried to head it out, 
but the ball grazed his shoulder and 
was redirected to the left post. A 
helpless Madden made a valiant but 
unsuccessful effort to stop its angle, 
but the accidental chip shot hit the 
left post and spun into the net, tying 
the score at I-\. 

"The shot was originally near 
post and I was on iI," Madden said. 
"I told [the team) right after. 'no 
worries, there was nothing you could 
do about it. '" 

But the UCSO offense never 
yielded. Just minutes later, Sergio 
Salvador sent a high-arching 
midfield pass to 6' 2" freshmanBrian 
Turner in front of the goalie's box. 
The taller Turner easily outleapt his 
defender and cut a gem of a header 
to the lower left post. Seemingly out 
of nowhere, Keeley flew in from the 
right side, pinning the ball against 
the low post and rolling forward for 
the spectacular save. 

"Turner swears the ball went over 
the line, but either way it was a big-
time save," Armstrong said. 

Oisappointment turned to fear 
when Romey violently collided with 
Keeley, twisting his ankle in the 
fall. A stunned crowd gasped as the 
Tritons' leading scorer limped off 
the field with six minutes left to 
play. 

"I didn't like it one bit," 
Armstrong said of losing Romey. 
"It was obvious the whole [Roanoke) 
defense relaxed when the big guy 
went out. Everybody was keying on 
the big lad." 

But not even a bullet to the head 
could keep the Triton star off the 
field for long. Romey reentered the 
match with four minutes left in the 
first overtime, 

"When he came back on, that 
was the turning point of the game," 
Armstrong said. "The crowd went 
bonkers and that lifted everyone." 

"[Romey] is a big guy and 
[Roanoke] was relieved to have him 
off the field," Curran said, "The 
intimidation factor he provides is 
irreplaceable. When he came back, 
you could tell that they tightened 
up." 

After two overtime periods and 
one sudden-death overtime, Curran 
finally ended the marathon match. 

"I think it was a bad pass and the 
defender who went back to get it 
wasn't running hard. S.:> I ran up to 
pressure him," Curran recapped.

FINAL 4: 
UCSD advances to 
11 th Final Four 
Continued from page 18 

"Our bench is playing excellent 
defense," Vesanovic said. "We are 
picking up balls we weren't picking 
up two weeks ago." 

They played great defense, made 
good adjustments a'nd attacked 
great," Athena Assistant Coach RobÂ· 
ert Okamura said. ''They did everyÂ· 
thing that makes UCSD, UCSD." 

The Tritons defeated SI. 
Benedict's 15Â· 11 , 15Â· 11, 15Â·3 on 
Friday to advance to the Western 
Regional Championship game. 

The.Blazers' big frontline burned 
like an unchecked fire in the nailÂ· 
biting first game. UCSD came out 
flat and St. Ben' s 6'1" middle 
blocker Tina Kampa peppered the 
Triton defense early. 

For every hardÂ·fought TritonÂ· 
won point, the Blazers responded in 
kind. Tied 8Â·8, San Diego finally 
broke through behind Heather 
Holtzclaw's inspiring net play. 

Vesanovic, who ended the night 

_ill 

with nine kills, slammed home a 
backlinescreamerforthe 15Â· 11 win. 

The second game was also tied 
at 7-7, until Kranz (13 kills) un-
leashed a one-woman arsenal upon 
the Blazer defense. A stone wall 
stood no better chance of stopping 
the sen ior's bazooka barrage. Kranz 
extinguished the Blazers' fire, and 
any hopes of an upset, clearing the 
pathway to a IS- II triumph. 

"[KranzJ had a field day," 
Dannevik said. . 

Gamethreewa a 15-3 cake walk 
with Kranz providing the icing on a 
3Â·0 sweep. 

"It took a while for us to get into 
our rhythym but everybody fed off 
of everybody else," Kranz said. "EvÂ· 
erything felt good tonight." 

" It was fun to coach tonight," 
Dannevik said. "I was pushing but-
tons and they were doing it. We 
were really just damn good." 

Crotty's excellent play atthe once 
uncertain setter position drew praise 
from both coaches. 

"ICrotty) was on her game. She 
was deceptive and had great set se-
lections," St. Ben's Head Coach 
Carol Howe-Veenstra said.

F,..hmM Ele Johneon blows by Plymouth State defenders In Tritons' 1-0 overtime loss at Rnal Four. 

w. SOCCER: 
UCSD falls to 
Plymouth in OT 
ContInued from pale 20 
defenders had to struggle to clear 
several Plymouth State charges. The 
Triton offensive attack, which re-
lies heavily on long passes from the 
back, was also compromised. 

That isn't to say UCSD didn't 
have some chances in the opening 
half. About seven minutes into the 
game, Triton Daphne Farnum took 
a throw-in from teammate Eva 
Kingsbury deep in Plymouth State 
territory. 

Farnum quickly turned and fired 
from the left side. The ball crossed 
past Panther goalkeeper Jamie 
Wilhite, but Plymouth's Lisa 
Berberian was there and got her 
knee on the ball to end the threat. 

Seven minutes later. Farnum was 
again on the leftÂ· hand side when she 
centered to fellow Triton Ele 
Johnson, who was on the right side 
of the penalty box_ Johnson wasn't 
there for long, though. Panther de-
fender Jessie Brown went for the 
pass along with Johnson and simply 
shoved the Triton out of the way. 

It wasasignofthingstocome for 
UCSD, which has struggled with 
several physical opponents this sea-
son. The Tritons have instead relied 
on their speed, long passing game 
and ball skills to pull them through 
against rough-and-tumble teams, but 
on Saturday the weather alone took 
away those advantages. "We're just 
too nice of a team," UCSD Head 
Coach Brian McManus said. 

Plymouth State was giving the 
Triton defense a challenge as well. 
The 'Panthers had a number of op-

portunities, their best one coming 
with 20 minutes to play before inter-
mission. Lisa Freda centered the 
ball from the left side to Panther 
Christine Borque, who was 10 yards 
out from the goal. Borque got her 
head on it and redirected the ball, 
but UCSD goalkeeperCari Schwartz 
was there for the save. 

While UCSD had trouble with 
its standard longball-up-the-side-
Iines-then-cross offense, the Tri tons 
were at times able todribble through 
the Plymouth State defensive center 
with impunity. 

With 15 minutes to play in the 
half, Farnum did just that. Taking 
the ball deep in the penalty box on 
the right side, Farnum juked two 
defenders, stepped to the outside 
and around another Panther and tried 
a shot between the keeper and the 
post. 

As the half ended it became clear 
that, despite a number of opportuni-
ties and at least partial control of the 
game, UCSD had not established a 
rhythm in the first 45 minutes. The 
Tritons would be in trouble if they 
didn't hit a stride soon. 

With the wind at their backs in 
the second half, it appeared the Tri-
tons were back on track. UCSD 
owned the first 15 minutes of the 
half. pinning Plymouth State back 
in its half of the field. With the 
Tritons finding their game, all that 
remained was to hope their luck 
would change. It didn't. 

With 10 minutes gone in the first 
half, UCSD's AmandaJohnson went 
straight up the center of the defense. 
Taking the ball just past midfield, 
she out-ran and out-moved four Ply-
mouth defenders as she made her 
way inside the penalty box. Cutting

After UCSD dominated the first 
15 minutes of the ~econd half. PlyÂ·

Panthers were able to force the Tri-

off balance.

free 10 yards from the goal. with 
Wilhite lying on the ground , It was 
another bad bounce for UCSD. as 
the ball rolled right to the Panthers' 
Sharon Caldwell, who cleared it out.

Tritons Extinguish Blazers, Claremont 
VOWYBALL: UCSD set to face Juniata after walloping Claremont, 3-1, to advance to their 11th Final Four appearance in ] 3 years 
By Brian K. Hutto 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD women's volleyball 
team will return to the NCAA Divi-
sion III volleyball promised land 
next weekend. after crushi ng 
Claremont College 15-6. 8-15, 15-
9, 15-6 in the Triton-hosted West-
ern Regional Championship last 
Saturday. 

Once again Head Coach Doug 
Dannevik has the Tritons, who are 
11-0 in regional championship 
matches, in contention for a seventh 
national championship banner with 
which to hang upon the hallowed 
walls of the Triton Main Gym. 

UCSD (24-9) will face host 
Juniata (41-3) in Pennsylvania next 
weekend. Defending national cham-
pion Washington University (42-2) 
battles Rochester Institute of Tech-
nology (41-7) in the other semifinal. 

San Diego, which sweptthe Col-
lege of SI. Benedict's Friday night 
in the Western Regional semifinals, 
struck first blood in game one. 
Sophomore Joyce Lee's sizzling 
serve to start the match resulted in 
chaos for the Athenas' backline. A 
botched spike off a poor set put the 
Tritons up 1-0. 

I 
, 

back attempt, deadlocking the score, 
12-8, but Harvey's rocket cross-
court winner took the tire out of the 
Athenas' resurgence. A Kranz ham-
mer to the right back line ended the 
game 15-9. giving UCSD a 2Â·1 ad-
vantage. 

"The 12-8 stand off was the dif-
ference in the game." Dannevik said. 
" Illook 1001' II triestoscoreapoi nt 
and that can be very fru ~traling. 
That kind of frustralionusually leads 
to shanks, shots out of bounds and 
rushed play. Whoever could break 
out of that lock would have more 
momentum. " 

In the deciding fourth game. 
Claremont temporarily grabbed the 
lead at 2-0. But seller Amy Crotty 
rallied her troops. poking trick sets 
into the Athenas' middle and ex-
pertly assisting Vesanovic, Harvey 
and A skeland wi th winners to every 
area of the court. 

UCSD put poi nl. on the board so 
fast. Clare mont spent more time 
piCking itsel f off the sk in-burned 
floor than returning anything the 
Tritons grilled their way. 

At 9-3, Kranz shattered the sound 
barrier with a sizz ling bullet slraight 
into the face of Alhena fr.:shman 
Caroline Vlasis. who received a ore 
welcome 10 the dominating world 
of San Diego vo lleyball. 

Vesanovic's spike 10 an open 
middle court mercifu lly ended the 
match. 15-6, and advanced the Tri -
Ions to ils II th Final Four appenr-
ance in 13 yenrs. 

Claremont, which earned the un-
fortunate task of facing the Tritons 
with a five-set vic tory over Trinity 
Universi ty on Friday. refused to be 
intimidated. The Athenas tied the 
score at I - I and held tough when 
trailing 3-2, but San Diego'soutside 
hitting corps of Julie Harvey, Liz 
Vesanovic and Laura Kranz over-
whelmed their competition. quickly 
running the tally to 11-3 before yield-
ing another point. 

Jason Hltcnlel Guarolan 
Junior Julie Harvey (left) and Krlsl Askeland stuffed St. Benedict's and Claremont's hopes for an upset. Brault acknow ledged the strength 

of UCSD' offense, but pinpointed 
its defense a~ the underlying fac!or 
in the Tri Ions' sll cces~. 

At 13-6, Kranz put on a serving 
school. Claremont fai led to contro l 
two gravity-bound spinnersoverthe 
middle and UCSD led 1-0. 

A combination of strong block-
ing anda tricky scoringduoof Zalika 
Milton and Vanessa McKenzie al-
lowed Claremont to jump out to a 6-
4 advantage in the second game. 

"We controlled the net in the 
second game," Claremont Head 
Coach Vicki Brault said. "We tried 
to work on adjusting our block and 
following certain hitter ." 

The Tritons closed the gap to 6-
5 behind a Kristi Askeland stuff of a 

McKenzie slam attempt , but 
couldn ' t stop the Athenas from 
storming their way to a 12-5 lead. 
. Dannevik turned to his bench, 
and freshman Christine Chi, play-
ing in her first NCAA playoff game, 
sent a blistering spike down the right 
side to make it 12-6. 

But UCSD conceded the game to 
Claremont. 15-8. lying the match 
score at 1- I. 

"Claremont ran a particular play 
10 their big hiners in game two and 
we were not in the proper defense," 
Dannevik admined. "Il took me a 
while to decide how to change our 
defense. They were running a fast 
offense in the second game but it 

didn' t work against us in the third 
and fourth games." 

The Tritons responded early in 
the third game. Kranz, Vesanovic 

and Harvey were up to Iheir old 
tricks. pounding balls to all areas of 
the court and grounding the Athenus 
net-blocking defense. 

According to Dannevik. it wa 
the freshman. Chi. who et the tone 
for the third and fourth games . 

"That big kill (in game two) al-
lowed her to gain some confi -
dence:' Dannevik said. " When she ' 
in. she occupies Ihat middle. We ,et 
her 17 limes and the Claremont 
blockers were forced to Slay at home. 
ThaI created a lot of' one-on-one 
outside hitting opportunitie, for 
[HarveYl, [Kranz] and [Vesanovicl. 
and they pounded the ball." 

Claremont made a late comeÂ·

20 SPORTS The U 'U GuardiaJl Monday. NO\'f'IIIIH'1' 15. 11)93 

Tritons Maroon Roanoke, 2-1, in OT 
MEN'S SOCCER: UCSD's Todd Curran scored 
the winning goal in the second sudden death OT 
By Brian K. Hutto 
Sports Editor 

In what was probably the most 
memorable scene in Triton sports 
history, senior Todd Curran left-
footed the game-winning goal 19 
econds into the second sudden-

death overtime period to give host 
UCSD a dramatic 2-
I victory over 
Roanoke College in 
the quarterfinal 
round of the NCAA 
Division III Men' s 
Soccer Champion-
ships on Sunday. 

The Triton tri-
umph advances fifth-
ranked San Diego to 
its fifth final four ap-
pearance. The host 
site will be chosen today. 

UCSD (19-2-1) looks to repeat 
it 1988 and 1991 NCAA National 
Champion performances against 
top-ranked Kenyon College of Ohio 
(16-0-4), which crushed Wiscon-
sin-Ohio, 2-0 on Sunday. 

In the other semifinal match, sec-
ond-ranked Williams College of 
Massachusetts (14-0-1) will meet 
22nd-ranked Clarkson College of 
New York (14-3-1). 

The weather could have worked 
against host UCSD in its quarterfinal 
match. Biting cold winds and an 
early-morning shower soaked the 

Triton playing field, and both con-
ditions favored the 19th-ranked Ma-
roons (20-4), visiting from the often 
damp and chilly East Coast climate 
of Virginia. 

Triton Head Coach Derek 
Armstrong said he didn't feel that 
the weather was an obstacle, how-

ever. "It really 
wasn ' t a problem," 
he said. 

UCSD drew 
first blood in the 
foul-ridden contest, 
21 :46 into the 
game. Curran re-
ceived a Chris Fong 
pass in the left cor-
ner of the field and 
proceeded to set up 
a one-man work-

shop on the Maroons' defense. 
Curran faked to his left, cut right 
and lofted a beautiful hanging floater 
over Roanoke goalie Rick Keeley to 
the far right post. Erik Waldman 
came charging in from the top of the 
box, anticipated the tlight of the ball 
and in mid-air, angled a picture-
perfect header to the center of the 
cage to give UCSD a 1-0 lead. 

"It was a pretty goal," Armstrong 
said. "Working the back post is 
something we've been practicing."

225-pound scoring menace, barely

Final Four Fallout 
WOMEN'S SOCCER: Traveling Tritons toppled, 
1-0, in overtime by Plymouth State Panthers 
By Gregg Wrenn 
Senior Staff Writer 

GENEV A, NY - Slam a ball 
into the ground and it could bounce 
in anyone of many directions. But 
for the UCSD women's soccer team 
at the NCAA Final Four this week-
end, it only bounced in one direc-
tion - the wrong one. 

In a game that brought back bit-
ter memories of last year's Final 
Four defeat, the Tri tons (17-1 -1) 
dropped a 1-0 overtime decision to 
Plymouth State (16-3-1) on Satur-
day. 

UCSD, which has visited the Fi-
nal Four five times in the last six 
years but has only captured the title 
once, in 1989, was the victim of a 
number of factors - the weather, 

physical play and the lack of a strong 
scoring punch. Despite those ob-
stacles, the Tritons were able to dic-
tate much of the contest, until they 
simply couldn't overcome the last 
challenge - bad luck. 

The Panthers and UCSD battled 
for control of the game eariy, when 
they weren't battling the elements, 
that is. Although considered a balmy 
day by upstate New York standards, 
the temperature struggled to reach 
the 40s. Of more concern to the 
teams was a blustery wind that would 
give a kite nightmares and some-
times made kicking a soccer ball 
like trying to boot a helium baloon . 

UCSD had to play into the wind 
the first half. As a result, the Triton

GUARDIAN ATHLETESÂ·OF-THE-WEEK 

Senior outside hitter '-II Kr.z wreaked havoc 
upon the defenses of St. Benedict's and Claremont College 
in the NCAA Division m Western Regional Volleyball 
Championship this weekend. 

Kranz had 25 kills, 27 digs, seven block assists and six 
service aces in the Triton triumphs over both clubs. Kranz 
unloaded four-straight winners in the decisive second 
lame alainst St. Benedict's. 

"Kranz had a field day," UCSD Head Coach Doug 
Dannevik said of her performance. 

Senior Todd CUft'811 scored the winning goal 19 
seconds into the second sudden-death overtime, lifting 
the Tritons to a 2-1 victory over Roanoke College of 
Virginia in the quarterfinals of {he NCAA Di\'ision III 
Men's Soccer Championships. 

Curran also had an assist on UCSD ' s tirst goal of the 
game-lofting across pass to teammate Erik Waldman. 

"[Curran] has been playing really well these last four 
weeks," Triton Head Coach Derek Armstrong suid. "He 
picked a great time to stan turning it on."
