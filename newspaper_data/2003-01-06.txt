Financial woes: As part of the Dec. 17 deasron ~ the UC Regents to ralsc student 
fees by $135 per quarter, students Will see their grants go up to offset the increase. 

John Muir College fres hman 
Kelly McLean said that though she 
didl1't like Ihe increascs, she fclt 
thcy wcre neccss,)ry and was happy 
Iha( one-third of the fees will go to 
finanCial aid . 

" It.., great that they're makmg 
sure that students can stay and (hat 
new swdem., WIll kecp coming," 
she sa id. 

The UCSA, on the other hand, 
sai I thcy would prcfer other solu-
tions to the one-thlrll phn. 

"We think it's somewhat silly," 
Mi ller said. "Thcre must he more 
efficient ways to increase state rev-
el1uc than thiS." 

Although DeAnda is expecting 
many students to ContaCI the linan-
cial aul office with fee-relatcd quc~­
tions, he .,aid that the office IS not 
expecting a large increa c In loan 
demands, explall1ing that demands 

increase each year a., the COSt of liv-
ing rises. 

"Looking at thc total cost of 
at!cnci3llce, fee are really only a 

~mall percentage," DeAnda said . 
" 0 doubt thcre is going to be 
more traffic, srudcnts asking more 
question, but we're just trying to 
maintam the status quo throughout 
the budget criSIS, and I thmk we'll 
be able to do that." 

Although DeAnda aid he IS 
"slightly wOrrlcd" that Cuts in bud-
gets might affect the financial aid 
oflicc's employees, hc reiterated 
the officc's mission is to do every-
thing pos ible so that UC D stu-
dents themselves nonce no change. 

The office plans to send e-
mail out during the first weck of 
winter quartcr to notify students 
of the repackaging of thcir finan-
cial aid.

LEIIERS TO THE EDITOR 
Troupe controversy 
smacks of hypocrisy 

Editor: 
We have a really sad and nasty 
l'onclll~ion 10 the Quincy Troupe 
imbroglio. Instead of sq uarely 
facing the complexity and univer-
sality of lying, the IIniversity (and 
Quincy hlll1scl0 Opt for polite 
and gracefu l cliches involving 

IIl1age~ rather than reality. 
t\11ll()~t everyone loves lI1ora liz-
Illg, nobody praises lying and 
allllo>t everyone has lied. Lies are 
~cldorn \imple, ranging from the 
little "white" ones that everybody 
tell, to the lies of Enron and high 
t:lI\'crnlllcnt ()fticial~ that do .1 
grc.1f ha rill to a lot of pcople. 
Troupe 's lie IS maybe a 2 on a 
,cale of 10, comparable to the 
routlnc padding of resumes or 
the I'llutlne in Hating of deduc-

tions on a 1040. 
And all the piou nonsense 

about the "role models" - an 
idea that should have been sti ll -
born! rol e Illodel is an invented 
image, a public rclations ideal 
which is itself a kind of lie. A gen-
uinely human model ha warts, 
Haws, imperfections - the kll1d 
we recognize in ourselves. And all 
the other non~ense ahout profes-
sors "living up to a higher stan-
dard"! T he standards we try to 
live lip to arc the sta ndards of 
logic and evidence and originality 
and creatiVity, and we reward and 
punish each other accordingly, 
But anyone II'ho knows profes~or~ 
knows that our nonprofe~sion.ll 
moralities arc human, i.e. full of 
the usual naws that make liS rec-
ogl1lzably human. 

The world is packed tigh t 
with tolerated lies. Police lie to

suspects, doctors may lie to 
patients, lawyer~ arc seldom 
completely candid . A Burundi 
proverb goes, "The man who 
tells no lie cannot fced his chi l-
dren," Ilusbands and wives lic to 
each other, know that they arc 
being lied to, and so on . 
Shakespeare puns, "I lie with her 
and she with me, and in our 
faults hy lies we nattcred be." 

When a university, presumably 
dedicated to finding truths 
(including truths about lying), 
opt for cliches, piety and PR, we 
:III lose. There should have been a 
campus-w ide movement of con-
fessed human liars (students, st~ff, 
f:lculty) to demand that Truupe'> 
resignation not hc accepted . 
Instead, the loss and di~gracc is 
OUl's.

financial aid. The UC Office of 
the Pre ident in ists "students 
from families with annual incomes 
of 60,000 or less will nor be 
impacted by the fee increase," 
hccall e new financial aid oppor-
tunitics will co\'cr their addi(lonal 
ruitlon. 

Ilowc\'cr, it is not only those at 
the bottom of California's socioe-
conomic ladder who are worried 
abour rising nlition : Middle-class 
families may be strapped to pay 
the additional 405 a year, espe-
cially if they have more than one 
college-age child. Financial aid 
opportunities are slim for tho e 
families, and thIS will undoubtedly 
leaU to snldenr graduating with 
more debt. 

Instead of placing a financial 
burden on students and their fam-
ille ,perha)l the focus should be 
on reducing budgets on programs 
that are already receiving a iz.1ble 
chunk of the state budget. Prisons 
received 3.9 billion from the 
1002-03 Budget Act, 6.7 percent 
of the total tate budget for a size-
ahle .1 billion. Keep in milld 
thar the California Department of 
Correction> IS expected to see a 
decrea,e In Its IIlmate population 
from 156,049 in june 2001 to 
155,721 111 Junc lOCH . Bur the 

budget is allocating more money 
for jails, not less. 

That same budget allotted 
11 .2 billion for roads, highways, 

mass tran It and intercity rail, 
vehicle licensing and registration, 
and highway law enforcement. It 
authorized $126.4 million for the 
Technology, Trade and Commerce 
Agency, 98 percent higher than the 
amount proposed in 1998. 

That's not to say that the state 
doesn't need prisons, roads and 
tOurism. It isn't to say that these 
are things that can be ignored. Bur 
there's definitely an arguable 
amount of money that can be 
moved around and relocated, and 
funding for the University of 
California is not negnriable -
California has an obligation to the 
stare ro fulfill their part of the 
State- niversity Parrnership, 
even if it means taking away frOI11 
olher areas of the budget. 

I f the state nee(ls to ra i e 
money, perhaps they should think 
about raising the costs of IlL~ury 
items. The liquor tax i OJ per-
cent. Tobacco is 1.2 percent. 
These arc items With fees that can 
be raised because they are item, 
that are not necessary .. 

nd then therc's the is,uc of 
tho.! additional enrollment of 8,OOe 
undergraduates the uni"crsit), 

must carry in the 2003-04 school 
year. Four thousand of these stu -
dems are considered "overcn-
rolled," meaning that the state is 
not providing the funthng for 
them. In 2002-03, UCSD was 
overenrolled by 500 students. 

ll1cre arc a'lreacly students that 
the chool call't ~fford. If the 
school is going to Institute a 
increase in tuid n, then it should at 
least he one that affects incollllllg 
srudcl1Is only. Srllllt:nts who 
applied to a school under lhe 
impression that it would COSt a spe-
cific amount shouldn't be subject to 
the same financial fluctuations as 
later applicants who willmore like-
ly benefit from fee increases. 

Many college tuden tS are 
already poor. They 'are alreJdy 
cuning coupons and eating ramen 
noodles by the case. I ow is not 
the time to place the burden Oil 
those who can least afford it. Tlw, 
is ahout the Idea of luxury and 
necessity. Educalion is not somc-
thing that should hc reserved tilr 
the rich . And that docsn'L lIIe:ln 
assigning low-income student, to 
comltlunlty colleges md cxtension

The e critics contend that stlldenrs

absorbed major cuts and the univer-
sity'S funding is now ~ignificantly 
below the minimum ca lled for in our 
Partnership Agreement with the 
g-overnors office," said UC Presid~m 
Richard C. Atkinson said in a Dec. 6, 
2002 statement. "But we also know 
that thc university must playa role in 
the state's hudge! solutions." 

UC rc earch programs will see ,I 
one-time reduction of $18 million, 
in addition to the $32 million 
already cut in September 2002 
when the current year's budget was 
passed. Programs targeted for 
reduction include U.S .-,\1exico, 
labor and subst:tnce abuse research 
projects. UC research has 
decrcascd in funding by more than 
15 perccnt ovcr the last year. 

An additional $20 million was cut 
from administr,llion and libraries 
,lCroSS the svstetll, where each cam-
pus ami the' flice of the President 
will allocate irs ,hare of the reduc-
tion at tl1cir di scretion. Campuses 
will also have local discretion as to 
how they will allocate their portions 
of thc $6.3 Il1IlIion reduction to stu-
dent sClvices programs. 

founding for K-12 outreach pro-
grams will decre,lsc an additional 5 
percent with the new cuts because 
$3.3 million was sla,hcd in Davis ' 
most recent reductions. K-12 Out-
reach has been decreased hy $10 
million since the ~002-03 budget's 
pass;lge. The UC College 
Prcp.lr;ltory Initiativc, which pro-
\'Illes ad\'anced pbcement course

lion . . 

A >tudem fcc increase was 
appro\'cd to offsct $1 C) million tllat 
would have otherwise been cut to 
Il1Slrtlctional progr:lIl1S, UC 

spokesperson Brad Hayward said. 
Effective spring 2003, underb'l'a<iu-
ates at the University of California 
will he assessed a $135 increase per 
quarter. One-tllird of the additional 

r~~'enue gcnerated by fee hike will 
be allocated directly to financial aid. 

Ila}"vard said that the fee 
increase was made to protect the 
qualiry of education at thc univerSity. 

"\Vhilc UC was reluctant to 
rai . e fcc for the first time ill eight 
years, it was the nnly way to pre-
vent from cutting even further into 
our programs," Ila}"vard said. "If 
fees weren't raised ;It this time, we 
would see significant cuts to 
instruction." 

Graduate smdents at the UCSD 
School of Pharmacy will see an 
increase of $250 per quarter and 
fcc at the UCSD School nf 
Medicine will increase $400 per 
quarter. 

Davis announced on Dec. 18, 
2002, that California faces a budget 
shortfall of $34.8 billion, or 45 per-
cem of the state's general fund for 
the 2002-03 fiscal year. Deficit esti-
mates just weeks before stated a 
$21 bill ion downturn. 

'me current year's budget agree-
ment, which remained in impasse 
for almost eight months after the 
June 30, 2002, deadline, gave Davis 
authority to make up to $750 mil-
lion in cuts by January 2003 . Davi 
has si nce been forced to eliminate 
more than 12,000 state jobs to com-
pensate for the budget slump. 

The UC Board of Regents 
vuted II to 4 in faror of the recent 
budget rcductlOm and fec increase. 
Lieutenant .overnor Cruz 
Bustamante, \ Yard Connerly, 
George M. ,\1arcus and tudent

By Wendy Lee 
Daily Californian (UC Berkeley) 
(U-WlRE) BERKELEY, 

Calif. - Tn a resounding voice 
\Vednesday night, UC Berkeley 
faculty said university policy 
toward protester student conduct 
must change. 

Tho~e attending \Vednesday's 
faculty forum, which add res~cd 
the subject of student acts of ci\'i1 
disobedience, said they want to he 
more involved in the earlier stages 
of conduct he'lrings. University 
administrators respondcd by say-
ing they would be open to modify-
ing the Code of Student Conduct. 

The codc has come under tire 
because of the manner in which 
each \"'heeler Hall protester has 
been dealt with by the universlry. 

"Our code of conduct docs not 
[allowl our snlclents to exercise 
their free speech willy nilly at this 
time," UC Berkeley Chancellor 
Robert Bercbhl said at the forum . 

The Academic enute passed a 
resolution on Dec. 2, 2002, askll1~ 
the chancellor to review the con':. 
duct code and recommend 
changes. 

"I'm perfectly happy to have 
the code undergo changes and 
modifications in any way the fac-
ulry sees fit," Berdahl said. 

ome of the faculty and stu-
dents at the forum questioned uni-
vcr ity policy based on outside 
pressures and II1vestors. 

UC Berkeley ociology profes-
sor Barne Thorne said when 
members from the b'l'OUP Students 
for ju>ncc m Palestine staged the 
Sit-in at \\'heeler llalliast pril , It 
was educational. 

"The demonstration was not 
disruptive," Thorne said. "It 
enhanced the emotional vitality of 
the cbssroom." 

:-JOt enough "broad" faculty 
consultation was tmlde herorc the 
university decided to go forward 
with the he'lring process, faculty 
argued. 

"The serious danger that the 
popularity or unpopularity of the 
speech could have a ~,tI1ction on 
the discipline selected," said LTC 
Berkeley law professor LlIllia 

" "Our code of conduct does not [allow] our 
students to exercise their 
free speech willy nilly at 

this time,lI

UC Berkeley Chancellor 

Kneger. 
But Berdahl said members of 

the Academic Senate advised him 
on thc process, denying allega-
tions he threatened the protesters 
With suspension if thcy went Jhe,ld 
with the sit-in. 

Cltherinc Koshland, chair of

Word Out! 
At UCSD, there are 2 ways to get the word out-to announce an event, find roommates or sell your 

old laptop. 

When you walk through the Price Center, you can see a zillion flyers pasted on 
the walls screaming for your attention . That's one way to get the word out. 

Design a flyer, take it to Cal Copy, pay for some copies, grab your roommates 
roll of tape, and walk all over 6 colleges pasting your message over the other 

messages. 

Or, you can email the Guardian, 
We will publish your message and distribute 11 ,000 copies throughout all 6 

colleges. Heck, your words will even reach a few thousand people in the surrounding communit ieS. 
In fact , Guardian c1assifieds are broadcast throughout planet ear th via www.ucsdguardlan.org, 
Also, we won 't rip your message down after a couple hours or tape another message over it. That's 
not like us . 

If you want to give us a try, here's what you do: 
Email. Include your message and your contact info, When you get to a 
phone, call us with your credit card info. By the way, $9 gets you 10 days or three issues (if you 
keep your message 20 words or less). 

If you need exercise, you can do the flyer thing also! However, even a Comm major can figure that 
a few dozen flyers circulating for a couple days ain't the same as several thousand messages 
circulating for a week and a half. 

Give us a t ry.

apple in his hand. 

"I wanted to be something 
really different," Mariano said . " I 
was kind of looking around my 
house the night before and all I 
had was a bunch of apples, so I 
thought, 'apples, apples ... 
Adam.'" 

Mariano said he decided to 
dispense wi th the tradi tional imagc 
of Adam with a fig leaf covering his

"In reality that was only human 
intervcntion," Mariano said . 
"Ideally, I was to corne up on stage

would take a bite from the apple, 
let its effects take o\'er, and bc
