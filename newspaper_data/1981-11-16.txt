The threat and reality of nuclear war

designated as a coun terforce si te, a targetted a rea in 
the event of a nuclear war , even a limited conflict, 
accord ing to cripps Institute of Oceanograph y 
geophys icist J im Brune. 

B rune was one of a num ber of exp r ts add re ' 'i ng 
a var iety of topics on t he consequen 'e and risk 
imolved in a nuclear w ar during the Veterans Day 
Convocat ion on t he Threat of Nuclear War. Along 
with UC , an Diego neuros ienti t Dr. Bob Livinston 
and Nobel La ureate in Medicine Dr. Rena to Dul 
Becco, Bru ne d iscu ed the probl ms of nu lear 
weapons. 

Brun told t h large a udience crammed in to two 
room s in the Revell Hum anities Libra ry tha t the 
"tremendou blow to human kind " cou ld re, ult in 
any of a number of effect ' including famine and 
int en t ion al genocide and aggre ion a mora l fiber 
decayed . H said d aths from such a war would 
rea h the hundred of millions. 

By comparison , the Chine earthqu ake of 1556, 
t he wor tin t rms of live 10 t , killed three quart er 
of a million. A quake in California would be 
e, timated to ki1125,OOOifit occurred at 4:30p.m. and 
4,000 at 2:30 a .m . 

He aid an accident de ribed a average 
ha pp ning at the San Onofre Nuel ar Gene rating 

tat ion would ki ll one per on with a wor t po s ible 
cas ki ll ing up to 4,800. 

Inside: 

The prohability of a seri()u~ earthquake in 
northern California bv the vear 2000 i~ about 30 
percent. Brune said. i'he odd~ a Cl'H>U neclear 
power plant accident will occur ar ' one to 100. 

Yet, in a recent Gallop Poll. one third of those 
polled . aid they fe lt there is a good chance there will 
be a major nuclear war by the year 2000. Two-thirds 
fe lt t here i . ome chance, he 'aid . 

" We really don 't know what our policy maker ' are 
decid ing," Brune said, "Are you willing to let 
som eone who would decide to u. e nuclear war over 
Middle Ea t oi l decide t he is ue of nuclear power 
plan t afet y?" 

Livings ton , former chairman of the Department 
of Defense Colloqui um on the problem of command 
and control, put it anot her way, saying he asked 
government offi cia l how they owu ld feel about 
killing a third of Europe' popu lation over a religiou. 
is ue a w as done in the Thirty Years War. How 
about killing a s imi lar n umber over a fami ly feud a, 
was done in t he War of t he Ros .? 

He said that neither idea was war mly received yet 
t he government continue to look upon a nuclear as 
a fea ible option. 

" Why can ' t we sp nd $8 bill ion on commum atlOn

A real issue 
[n recent \ eeks, att mion ha been focllsed on 

whether the political i sues addre ed by thi ' year's 
AS council have been relevant for immediate t udent 
concern. There is a 'egment of student opinion that 
ha aid that Coors labor practices and N 5tl 
investments in third world countries have litt Ie direct 
impact on students. Some have gone so far as to argue 
that the AS s hould not be a politically oriented body. 

Without a doubt, the AS hould be a ource of 
political information and action on campu . . But the 
A need to champion st udent cau e . 

Event la t week on the campu of CLA pose an 
excellent example for the AS. On 0 er 140 campuses 
around the country, convocat ion ' on the threat of 
nuclear war were sponsored by the nion of 
Concerned Scientists. It was the largest teach-in in 
the US since the Vietnam War. The UCLA 
convocation featured Gov. Jerry Brown as a speak r . 

The ASUCLA aw the opportunity to get Brown to 
Ii ten fir t-hand to 'tudent oppo 'ition to UC budget 
cut ,an immediate 2 percent cut aero.' the board, and 
a proposed additional 5 percent n xt fiscal year. 
A UCLA Undergraduate Pre ident Sam Law called 
together a rna ive anti·tuition rally of nearly 1,000 
UCLA tudents . 

The ub equent demon tration at the beginning of 
Brown's speaking time forced Brown to speak directl y 
to the budget cut issue. The demonst ration was large 
and succe. s ful , and yet maintained an orderly tone to 
it; there were no police or official confrontat ions. 

If ever there was an i. sue that direct ly affeC'ted 
student., the threat of increased fees, I uition, and 
cuts to the C libraries and services has got to be the 
issue. The st udent government at UCLA recognized 
this and organized one of the largest demonstrations 
s ince Vietnam and the draft, on the day of the largest 
teach-in si nce Vietnam. 

On the UC 0 campus, the UC Student Lobby 
postcard drive has been the only appreciable student 
re ' i ' lance to C budget cuts. One of our :ister 
campuses up north has given us a model of action on 
an importan t issue. The A UCSD should seize this 
opportu nity 10 fight on a political que~t ion th at all 
students can agree on .• ot only wi lllhis be beneficial 
for the students , the purpose of the AS, but such 
acllOn \\ill surely restore ,orne badly needed 
credibility to the council.

Europe and the Neutron Bomb 
L:nlil recenlly, most 

Europ ans were confident 
that t h lfS wou Id nev r ma",,· 
produc the neutron bomb. To 
make high -radiatIOn weapons 
t hat kill JX.. .. ople bu t leave 
buildings s tanding seemed 
barbaric. 

But on the36th anniversary 
o f Ihe atomic blasts at 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the 
Reaga n administration 
-hattered that confidence by 
deciding to stockpile the 
neutron bomb in the V . 

In Europe, where the 
neutron bomb would be 
deployt.u exclu:'lvely tu det er a 
Soviet ground attack (t he 
warhead has !x>en designed for 
ground·to·ground mis. iles and 
200mm arti llery \\ ith range" 
of 56 miles and 22 miles , 
respectively ). Ih reaclion wa,> 
more biller t han reported at 
fir<,l. 

"E\eryone wa,> :.hol'ked and 
ciepre'>sed b} the nt'\\'s," 
remarked Volker Hauck of th 
World InformatIOn service on 
Energy in Amsterdam. He told 
our reporter Michael Duffy. 
"This is a bad step for America 
and it wi ll make it tough for 
politlcal leader: h're to argue 
with t he I ace movement." 

lIS plans for I he neutron 
bomb are sure to be additional 
fodder for Europe's peace 
act in:.t s, who ha\ e alread, led 
a fierce and effective campaign 
to block NATO's planned 

deploy ment of 572 American· 
made cruise and Pers hing fI 
mi 'sile on Europ an ~oi l. 

" The Unit d States is 
pursu ing co nfrontat ional 
politics, not only against the 
.ov iets, but again s t lI s 
European allies as well," said 
Gied tenBerge of the Int er· 
Church Peace Council in The 
Hagu. His group provides 
guidance to the peac e 
movement in Holland . 

" Every coun try is being 
forced to say 'yes' or 'no' to 
neutron weapons without any 
chance of a dial og ue ," 
ten Berge cant inued. "The only 
con c lusion is the peace 
movement irt Europe will 
re"pond with a 'no' that i-; 
louder and louder." 

One st rategi st who declined 
to be identified sa id by phone 
from Am . t rdarn that 
European activ i st~ believe the 
II ' may be us ing the neutron 
bom b to force acceptance of 
cruise and Pershing mi 'si les 
on the continent. 

" It 's the first step In a 
p~ychol(Jgical game," he said. 
"They'll sit back and measu r 
our r eact ion, the size of the 
marches and the pos~ ibilitles 
for furt her concessions at 
November's NATO parley." 

Wh ile some Eyuropean 
government, are expected to 
hold back on their dissent from 
I he I~eagan decision, protc'sts 
Ihis fall in Bonn, Amsterdam, 

Pari s and Herlin are likely to 
make Europ an leaders think 
again about their quiet 
approach . 

"We're dr aWi ng up a 
declaral ion right now," said 
t enBerge, " remi ndi ng people 
of t he pressure we pu t on 
Jimmy Carter in 1977 and 1978 
to withdraw the (neutron) 
plans. We think it can be done 
again. " 

It may be to Secretary of 
State Alexander Haig's cred it 
that, having spent four year 
a. NATO commander in 
Europe, he en:ed th e 
ine\' itable res istance to the 
de c i s ion and pr o perly 
dis ented . And after spending 
a week in G rmnay and 
Holland, we can vouch for the 
intensit" of t his resistance. 
The y(iuthful mo\'ement of 
church organizations, IXllitical 
parties and ecology group 
hope to force Europe's leaders 
to resist A meri ca's nu clear 
designs on their continent. 

Obviousl} t he president is 
not receiving good intelligence 
on domest ic dissent in Europe. 
Moreover, h underestimate. 
the pres~ure he's putt i ng on 
the ne\\ fnends he made at the 
L'Conomic summit last month. 

U nle s" th e pre"lldent

Associated Students: power 'from' the people 
BY MARK SEECOF 

The Associated llIdents Council is presented 
\/dth a problem: some of the l 'C 0 student s it 
repre:.en ts are rat her di"sa! isfied WI t h its act ions . If 
this were an ord Inary, everyday , totalttanan state. 
th is would be no big deal. But , the AS government is 
supposed to be ad mocratic organization. 

The fact of this democracy is important. 11 is th 
reason whr student out rage is meaningful, and why 
student satisfaction is also important. The AS ha~ a 
clear responsibility to maintain cont act with the 
students, and to !ieek to do their will. 

But demo racies are special : in order to work they 
must have an informed electorate. Not just an 
ill/ormed electorate, a trulhfully informed electorate. 
The , tudents at UC D are not, right now, a 
truthfully informed electorate. In the current 
goings·on over the CWD Politica l Film eries , both 
David Tollner, the main instigator of the anti·CWD 
movement and the CWD's supporters have been 
Iyi ng to the students. Given this fact, it i . hard to see 
exactly what weight should be given to th 
hyperbole or the signed petitions of either s ide. 

Tollner ha al 0 lied about other things, as part of 
hi campaign to "influence" the AS. He told 
tudents that the AS prevented th Rec club from 

receiving free beer for Oktoberfest from oors. This 

i~ not ~o - the Rec clu b was gOIn.{ to purchase the 
beer from Coors. 

But the Committee For Wor ld Democracy, whi 'h 
means t he PolI tica l Film Senes, has ocen the main 

focu~ of Tollner's attack. He states that it receives 
$ 10,000 more than a ny other st udent organization. 
This may be narrowly true (If you ignore all the 
fund 'd media, wh ich are st udent orgs) but it i . till 
misleading: Tollner doesn't bother to mention 
SC RI. ASia, AASA, and oth er organi/ations 
receiving large su ms of AS money. li e attacked the 
AS Cou nci l for using fund s to advertise it · bay co! t of 
Nestle product s - but hedidn 't even bother toget an 
authorization from the Council to use its money to 
pay for his personal Guardian advert isement s for 
hi s anti· WD campaign. 

Th supporters of the CWD, on th oth r hand, 
have been ob -erved over tating th number of 
students t hat attend any given movie. A reasonable 
figure for the number of students attending the 
averag film (th number leap: dramatically when a 
popular film is scheduled) is probably around a 
hundr d and fifty. Not four hundred . [t is also 
mis leading of CWD s upporters to state that DaVid 
Tollner is a fasci t. 

Given this climate of ongoing mis·information, 
the Associated Students Council should consider thf' 

charges made by Tollner carefu lly (as some of t herll, 
like the ones con ce rning Jules Bagn eri s' 
expenditures, probably are very close to student 
hearts), and try to separate the fa lsehoods they 
contain out. Then, they s hould invite(perhaps with 
s ign ·in sh el s of their own) some real s tudent 
r sponse to a legitimate s tatement of th facts . If 
Tollner a nd CWO supporters can put out po ' ler -, 
ads, and manifes tos, and get stu den ts to sign 
petitions, there must be enough interest that 
students would take the time to s ign one CO lumn or 
the other of an AS sponsored "pet ilion." Or else, the 
As 'ociated tud nts Council could do what it 
Cons titution suggests to learn the will of the 
s tudent s: hold a referendum . But anything is better 
than having the people who believe that lies in the 
name of the cau e are all right th sole sources of info 
to the s tudents. 

The AS should tell the students what's going on, 
s hould solicit their input in some active way (noneof 
this "come to the meeting, having notified u the day 

• before, and ' p ak during the agenda time alloted for 
, tudent input' .,,"), and then do what the tuden ts 
want. This is the way a representative democracy 
s hould work.

Letters to the Editor 

Students must speak out against nuclear war 
E ditor : 

On 11 November 1981 , a 
convocation was held here at 
UC D regarding the threat of 
nuclear war. I was very 
di turbed by the low 
attendance of tudents at this 

ymposium. If feel it is time for 
s tudents to take action against 
the very possible threat of 
nuclear war. 

Never before ha s the Human 
pecies had to face such a real 

possibility of ultimate 
destruct ion . Nuclear weapons 
have the potential of killing 
ma populations as well as 
the potential of eliminating the 
entire civili zation a we know 
it today. These weapons 
threat en our very urvival. A 
threat of this kind represents 
the greate t moral issue 
mankind ha ever had to face. 

It may not be the ca e that a 
nuclear threat wou ld 

necessa rily lead to total 
nuclear war and thereby the 
extermination of humanity , 
but the danger of escalation is 
so great that we can no longer 
it idly by, urrendering 

control of our lives and our 
future to the few people who 
have the power over whether 
we are to live or die. 

It is ea y to blind ourselves 
to thi very real and imminent 
danger. For many, it creates 
feeling of despair, helples · 
ness, and powerle ne . This 
need not be the case. Now, 
more than ever, people are 
peaking out again t the 

implications of nuclear 
weapons and t he threat of 
nuclear war - professors, 
phys icians, musicians, people 
of all nat ions are uniting in an 
effort to promote change. 

The voice of the youth must 
be heard. We, as students, 

ha ve a moral obligation to take 
action, to fight for our futures. 
How unrealistic it is for us to 
educate ourselves as a means 
to a future goal, to sacrifice so 
much for the present, when 
our future is so unpredictable. 
We must ORen our eyes , 
educate ourselves about the 
danger of nuclear weapons, 
and take action. Thi action 
will enable us to take the 
control of our live out of the 
hands of a few world leader 
and hopefully make our future 
more predictable. Only after 
this is don e can we 
realistically utilize the pre ent 
and plan for the future . 

The apathetic attitude 0 
prevalent in today's youth as 
well as society is only self· 
defeating. There are many 
ways we can effect change. It 
is certain ly a compromise to 
say we cannot change nuclear 

weaponry policies . People can 
effect change by speaking out, 
by simply not accepting things 
they are morally opposed to. 
The demonstration. against 
the Vietnam war in the s ixtie 
are evidence of this fact. AI 0, 
observe the change brought 
about by people s peaking out 
against the Three Mile Is land 
accident. We mu t speak out in 
opposition of such weapons 
that threaten our very lives. 
Not to do so would begiving up 
what we value the most. 

The California Bila teral 
Nuclear Weapons Freeze 
Initiative can be the first step 
in thi battle against nuclear 
weapon. The Initiative i an 
effort to urge the US 
government to propose to the 
government of the oviet 

nion an agreement that both 
cou ntries immediately halt the 
te sti ng , production, and 

deployment of all nuclear 
warheads, missiles, and 
delivery sy terns. A minimum 
of 350,000 signatu res of 
California voters must be 
obtained bet ween December, 
1981 , and April, 1982, to place 
the Initiative on the ballot for 
November, 1982. This can be 
the first reali tic qtep in 
calling for a ' nuclear arms 
freeze. ' I hope every 
Californian who values life at 
all will seriously consider 
igning a petitIon to get this 

Initiative on the ballot . It 
represents the beginning of a 
long balt Ie against nuclear 
weapons. It i. a battle upon 
which our lives depend and a 
battle we can surely win If we 
take aClion . If we choo. e not to 
fight, we do not deserve to be 
here anyway.

AS Council meeting was both funny and sad 
E d itor: 

As a member of the Revelle 
College Council and a st udent 
at UCSD I must share a mo t 
laughable and, at the arne 
time, sad event which I 
experienced the other night. 
As a result of a unanimous 
dec ision by RCC in su pport of 
the freezi ng of the Committee 
for World Democracy's funds 
in order to look into a more 
equitable division of activity 
fee. to s tudent orgs and 
alternate type. of funding for 

the political film series, I and 
the other members of RCC 
decid ed to attend la st 
Wedne day's AS meeting. 

The joke began shortly after 
the AS meeting got underway. 
Each side of the funding issue 
had 10 minutes to present its 
case under tudent input. 
Speaking as the voice of a great 
many student s, Dave T ollner, 
spoke in an organized mature 
fa hion about the issue at 
hand . CWD was receiving 
$12,500 ($10,000 more than 

any other tudent organiza· 
tion ) while man y other 
student orgs received nothing 
or a bare minuimum. Out of 
fairne to all the e s tudent 
orgs he was asking for a 
reasse s ment of CWD' 
funding. This \Va all. He did 
not name call, attack the film 
series, or speak on any other 
issue. Throughout his speech 
(and one given by another 
tudent on the ame ide) 

people from the audience 
yelled rude comments and 

even Alma Key (AS vice 
president and chair) herself 
topped the econd student's 

speech when it approached 
name calling and possible 
distortion of facts . 

Here comes t he funny part. 
CWD was now given it 10 
m inutes to ' peak. What 
ensued, in a prepared speech 
read by one of CWD's 
member, was a \' iciou name 
calling attack again t Dave 
Tollner, a distortion of what 
the i. su e at hand actually wa , 

and even implied that tho e 
not in support of the film serie 
were for killing babies in 
South Africa. Dunng his 
speech everal other RCC 
members and I exchanged 
que. tloning glance and 
whl. per. What wa he 
talking about? What did thi 
have to do with alternate 
funding means for the film 
enes and many tudent org ' 

receiving a workable budget?

California might vote on nukes 
SAN FRANCISCO - As a 

wave of .protest against Soviet 
and US nuclear trategie 

weep acro Eu rope, 
European increasingly are 
wondering why Americans do 
not appear to hare their 
concern. An effort now is 
under way in California which 
may, in fact, put that concern 
to the test. 

December 1 will be the 
. tarting date for signature· 
gathering throughout Califor· 
nia on a petition calling for a 
mutual "freeze" on nuclear 
weapons by both the United 
States and the Soviet Union . 
The aim is collect half a 
million voter s ignature s 
within 150 days, in order to 
qualify this measure for 
inclusion as an initiative on 
the November 1982 ballot. A 
carefully planned campaign to 
rally support through 
volunteers has been developed, 

centered largely around 
religiou organizations and 
churche , univer ities and 
women' group, together 
with scientists and physicians 
who have their own veh icl e 
for anti ·nuclear expre ion . 

Young people who demon· 
strated recently against 
nuclear power plant here are 
expected to rally with even 
greater vigor again t nuclear 
war. But the young are not 
alone in this effort. It reaches 
wide. 

The nuclear freeze initiative 
admitted ly would have no 
enforcement leverage, no legal 

tatus and no means to alter 
governmental courses, either 
here or abroad. All it actually 
amounts to is an expression of 
the pu blic will - or as skeptics 
put it , mere "wi hing, " a 
fantasy asserted against stark 
reality . Proponents demur. 
More than a "wi h, " they call 

it a hope, ass rted just when 
the human race is running 
short of hope. 

The measure tates that 
there exists "substantial and 
growing danger of nuclear war 
between the United States and 
the Soviet Union which would 
re ult in millions of deaths .... " 
It declares its intention "to 
reduce the threat of nuclear 
war" by calling on leader hip 
in both nations "to halt the 
testing, production and 
further deployment of all 
nuclear weapons .... " 

Such a move, it pecifies, 
should be - and could be -
verifiable by both sides. But it 
ask the US government to be 
the tarting pomt; to propose a 
freeze to Russia as well as 
undertake one itself.

any respect I had for what 
these people stood for. A an 
aside I may add that Alma Key, 
showing blatant favoritism, 
wanted all yelled comments

fact . I was shocked since f had 
always heard and read about 
the good way s he ran 
meetings. It was di scouraging 
to see how u nf air and biased 
she w~s. 

Here comes the ad part. 
Freezing CWD's budget came 
to a vote. After the most 
immature and unfitting 
speech actually made by a 
UCSD college student (I would 
expect at least something 
above name ca lling) the vote 
was 4 AS member for the 
fr eze (Dave Tollner and 
Revelle' s 3 AS Reps) and ]3 
against. Jus t think, thecouncil 
wa finally getting a 101 of 
s tudent input which they 
ideally s hould seek and it was 
blatantly ignored 

So where does that leave us 
the students? ft leaves us with 
many tudent organization 
without money and a good film 
ser ies unwilling to try 
alternative means of funding 
in order to help these student 
orgs. Even worse it leaves us 
with reperesentatives who, 
when they finally do receive 
st rong input from many 

tudents, ignore it.

Brown vague on extent of cuts 

Tells SBPC little about slashing of DC's budget 
Gov. Edmund G. Brown met 

privately Saturday at UCLA 
with a small group of UC and 
Cal State University officials 
to di sc u s his recentl y 
proposed cuts in the UC 
budget. 

The Student Body' 
President Council (SBPC) and 
the California State Student's 
Association (CSSA) reque ted 
that Gov. Brown reconsider 
next year's five percent budget 
cuts which might lead to the 
institution of tuition on the UC 
and Cal State ca mpuses. 

At tending the executive 
meeting for UCSD was AS 
President Jules Bagneris. 

"Essentially what came out 
of the meeting was an 
under tanding t hat student 
can participate in the process 
and are willing to participate 
in the proces if he (Brown) 
will allow them to do so," 
Bagneri aid. 

Bagneri added that Gov . 
Brown was "more vague than 
usual" in answering the 
student's que tions . 

Bagneri fear that Brown's 
threatened budget cut will 
cause the UC sy tem to 
become an elitist inst itution . 

In a question read at the 

meeting, Bagneri s asked: 
"Gov. Brown, your past efforts 
have indicated that higher 
education should be a right 
and not a privilege. This i in 
harp contrast to then Gov. 

Reagan 's attitude that higher 
education was only for the 
privileged. 

"However, the combination 
of his federal budget cut with 
the five percent cuts you are 
considering ... will result in 
making education more of a 
privilege tha n a right. The 
result of thIS is to deny access 
to thousand. of less privileged 
students. 

"What will you do to keep 
UC and Cal State from being 
only for the privileged?" 

According to Bagneris, Gov. 
Brown's reply was "very 
vague and very general." 

One hundred dollars of the 
president' di cretionary fund 
was used to pay for the trip up 
to Lo Angeles, Bagneris aid. 

"The magnitude of the 
current (UC budget) cut 
nece sitate that direct action 
be put toward addressing 
these concern . And if that reo 
quires a hundred dollars or a 
thousand dollars in order to 
save tudent hundreds of 

Rally for anitnals 
A rall y is scheduled for 

tomorrow noon on Revelle 
Plaza to protest the alleged 
mistreatment of animal in 
UCSD laboratories: according 
to a spokesperson for the 
Animal Welfare Coalition of 
San Diego. 

The coalition charge that 
UCSD re earchers are 
unnecessarily cruel to animals 
while performing resea rch 
using them . The newly· 
formed group, compri sed 
mainly of "concerned 

members of the community," 
decided to rally at UCSD after 
the San Diego County Board of 

upervisors recently voted not 
to order a grand jury 
investigation of UCSD's 
research animal policies and 
practices. 

The coa lition is also upset 
with the city's recent renewal 
of a contract providing UCSD 
with s tray animals for 
re earch purposes, the 
spokes person said.

answeri ng recent criticism 
that he has misused hi s 
di cretionary funds . 

Bagneris added that he is 
willing "to lead the crusade" 
against budget cuts without 
the help of the AS Counci l. 

A motion to temporarily 
freeze Bagneris' discretionary 
funds wi ll be made at next 
weeks AS meeting. According 
to Pam Gerber, Commissioner 
of External Affiars, a lot of 
students ha ve complained 

about Bagneri s' use of 
discretionary funds . 

The motion will require 
Bagneri s to garner the 
cooperation of another council 
member in order to sp nd 
discretionary monies. 

"Instead of making single 
person deci s ions he would 
have to con ider the opinion of 
another council member," 
Gerber said. 

Gerber called the motion 
"preventi ve medicine." 

At next week's AS meetmg, 
Bagneris will move to have 
.'2,500 of the Genera l 

Unallocated fund s appropriat· 
ed to the executive branch for 
research projects. According 
to Bagneris. the research 

project~ will look into the

budget cut, and the financial

Recreation center no'\V 
awaiting final planning 

BY LAEL HANERFELD 
A new recreaton center , 

which will include a 25 meter 
squa re pool, racquetball 
:ourt ,showers, locker rooms, 
and other facilitie s, i 
scheduled to begin construc· 
tion Jan. 10, near Warren 
Campu . 

However, construct ion of 
the facilitie might be delayed 
if a proposed $1 million grant 
is donated by the La Joila 
Swim As ociation . If 
forthcoming. the grant WIll 
allow for the con truction of a 
larger main pool and the 
addition of a separate diving 
pool. The grant i expected to 
delay constructio n an 
additional two to six months. 

The construction of thi 
recreation center wa s 
approved by UCSD students in 
last spring referendum vote. 
The referendum que tion 
proposed to pay for the 
facilitie by a e sing a $12 per 
tudent per quarter fee. It will 

take 30 years for the facilities 

to be fully paid for. 
Las t year, hO\vever, was not 

the first tim a referendum 
question has called for the 
construction of recreation 
facilitie . 

For Bert Kaboyashi, director 
of campu recreation , it ha 
been a long struggle to gain 
st udent s upport for a 
recreation center. 

Five year ago tudents 
vetoed a referendum for a 
major recreat ion center, which 
included a golf cour e and 
which would have cost S6 
million . The next year 
Kaboya hi founded a referen· 
dum committee which was 
compri ed o f him elf , a 
graduate s tudent and two 
undergrad . The committee 
recogni zed that the fir t 
referendum had been vetoed 
because of its placement, in 
01 en Field, acro the 
freeway, its size and co t, and 
its country·clu b atmosphere. 
They et out to come up with 
an agreeable plan . 

The committee surveyed 
student interests and came up 
WIth a plan that included a 
pool, racquetball court·, 
shower. and locker rooms. 

After a year of weekly 
meeting the plan wa put up 
for student vote. Although the 
referendum gamed two· thirds 
of the campus' approval, the 13 
percent \·oter turnout wa n't 
enough to pass the referen· 
dum. 

The next yea r , the 
referendum committee, which 
now mcluded a representative 
from each college, decided to 
reintroduce the i ue in a 
referendum que tion in the 
following election. This time, 
there wa sufficient student 
turn out (25 percent) and 
sufficien t. tudent approval (72 

percen~) 
A recreation center 

referendum que t ion - which 
included a $12 per tudent 
asse sment fee - wa finally 
approved last s pring.

Convocation on nuclear war: reflections

Multiple Cndependent Pre·entry Vehicle, Mutual · 
Iy Assured Destruct ion , s trategic evacuat ion . 
population caIculat ion , warhead. fa llout , fi ss ion 
fusion : the bomb. 

When r decided to cover the November 11 
Con vocati on on Nuclear War, I wasn't s ure how to 
present t he m aterial. I bega n In te rv iewing people at 
ten in the morning and for twelve hours [ flipped 
back and fort h between objective reporter and 
s lackjawed part icipa nl. T here was a tremendous 
amou nt of information present ed by a wide array of 
s peakers. Merely re lat ing what ()Ccured fail s to 
convey the most import ant part of th e event : the 
tre mendou. amount of hum an involvement. Thi 
report is not an account of the convocation but 
ra ther my reaction to it. 

The speakers di scu 'sed a wide variety of topics 
inclu ding the medical consequences of a nuclea r 
wa r , the environme nt al effects , L-ommun ication 
problems during an a ttack, Ihe h i ·tory of th e ar ms 
race. T heir was even a token hawk in the person of 
Dr. r~obin Ra nge r. His eloquence and composure in 
t he face of a hosti le audIence s ta nd as an example to 
those who would air their differences in a clear and 
constructI ve man ner. 

The basis for most of the discussions at t he 
convoca tion \.\ as that nuclear war is si mply not a n 
accepl able political opt ion. This is a fine sen timent , 
bu t t he fac t remai ns t hat nucl ear weapon are a n 
Integral part of our national defense sys tem. People 
view thi s ituat ion differently. Some see it as a 
necessary evil . others as an intolera bl e 'tate of 
a ffairs .. 

Robin Ranger told u that di a rmament was an 
unattain able ideal. and th at arms limi tat ion talk. 
were only a poli tical salve with no real effects. The 
dete rrance policy, based on equal milit ary trengt h 
wa the mos t reali -tic course. Spurgeon Keeney said 
that arms limitation talk did have real effects and 
that they must be continued. a sentiment al so vo iced 
by Herb York and other participants. 

My own opInIOn is that wh Ile t he policy of 
deterrence has h istorica lly had a k y role in averting 
major wurld conflicts, in the long r un, it h 
inadequate. Deterrance doe not hi'l\'e a mechanl !i m 
for red ucing tensions or eli minati ng conflict. It I.., a 
sy m ptumatic treatment \"hich does not cu re the 
disease. Open conflict can be avoided hut the 
underlying ca u" : of the conflict contInue 10 fester 

COMMENTARY 
These primary cause. of conflict musl be addr ssed, 
and negot iation are the fi rs t step. Stanford hIstory 
professor Bilrton Berns tei n said that deterrence 
only buys us time, and we have not ..,pent that tim 
very wif>e ly 

People, notably the President. VIce president. and 
Secretary of tate, are ta lking alxlu t 'II mited' and 
'winnable' nuclear war. Barton Bern..,tien POInted 
out that Amer ican leaders from Truman on have 
con idered nuclear arms legit imate weapons for lI<;e 
aga in'l l an enemy. Eisenhm"el wa" urged by 
advisors 10 llse nukes. and t hey wen' abo considered 
during the Viet nam war. I asked my~elf how our 
leaders ca n seriously talk about nuclear war. Part of 
the answer II s in the nature of the language. 

One of I he nicer features of language is the noun . 
In ·t ead of saying, "t he meeting on Ihe eleventh 
which \.\ as attended by several hundred people. and 
tn cluded spf'akers from a variety of dIsciplines ... " 
and so on . r can just . ay, "the cUl1\oration," and be 
unders tood. T he nou n i ' art of an abbreVIation of 
shorth and. It is handy bUI t rou blesome because it 
abs t racts from rea lity. The convocation rea lly was 
severa l hundred people etc. and this fact should not 
be minimi7ed . The 'audience' was myself, my friend 
Jeff , a student r met named Eve. and other real 
people.

en rgy to makt: a 'popu lation ' Into p ~op le and talk 
about kIlling real flesh and b1o<)(1 human bemgs.

A recurring th me of the Nov. II convocation on

biggest political i. ue and moral dilemma of our

The convocation 'Ii a' billed a!:. a tea h in, and 
educational undertaking. What then did it tach? It 
did not di cuss in a . y t"matic way the technology of

Buckingham takes 
'Law' in his own hands 
Fleetwood Mac guitarist adds solo 
album to his diversified portfolio 

depends on "whatever seems 
to fit together in the end." 

'T11 Tell You Now" is the 
oldest cut off of the new solo 
effort. Had it been written a 
few months earlier it would 
have be n on Tusk. 

.. eptember ong" and 
"Love From Here, Love From 
There" are two songs 
insprired by Buckingham's 
father' s collection of 78 
records, dating back to the 
1920s 

BY VALERIE McMULLIN 
[n late October Lindsey 

Buckingham. guitarist for the 
popular Fleetwood Mac, 
released hi s fir t 010 album, 
Law a~ld Order (Asylum). It is 
an innovative combination of 
original work set alongside 
various tunes of yesteryear. 

[n a recent interview at the 
Elektra/ Asylum offices in Los 
Angeles, Buckingham talked 
about his new album, the new 
Fleetwood Mac alb\lm and his 
life in general. 

He contribute a great deal 
to the production of Fleet wood 
Mac albums and his develop· 
ing expertise comes to surface 
in Law and Order. "The 
recording technique and the 
playing of the instrum ent i a 
great part of my mu ic. In 
general, it goes hand in hand 
with the writing." 

Expectations ran high as 
each Fleetwood Mac album 
we nt platinum putting 
pressure on the group . 
Buckingham almost refuse to 
acknowledge the pre sure put 
on him to always excel and be 
" better" than the prevous LP. 

He doesn't think in terms of 
topping one plateau after 
another. he is simply in search 
of new ideas, new things he 
can learn from . 

This search for a new 
approach is exemplary of 
Buckingham's love for 
experimentation. 'Tm always 
triving to approach orne· 

thing a little bit from left field, 
even if the son? is a fairly 
traditional song.' He does a lot 
of taping at his home, several 
of which songs were on Tusk' 
and Law and Order. "That 
spirit of experimentation i 
something I strive for. .. Limi· 
tations or not , if the means you 
u e to achieve something are 
unu ual , the result may al 0 
be unu ual." 

On "Trouble." the ingle 
release from Law and Order, 
Mick Fleetwood played the 
drums. Despite a recording 
se sion las ting until 4:00 a.m . 
there wa n't a take Bucking· 
ham felt was solid enough 
from start to finish . So he 
decided to cut a hort four· 
<;econd tape loop of the original 

Lindsey Buckingham: " I 'm always stl'iving to approach things 
a little bit from If'ft field, even if the song is fairly traditional." 

drum track and play it over 
and over for the ent ire song. 

What exactl y does "Law and 
Order" represent? "Law and 
Order i. meant to be u ed in a 
sense of .omehow finding a 
ense of order in your own 

life ... creating a ense of 
disci pline by which to live, a 
sense of commitment and 
making commitments to 
things that you careaboul...So 
much of rock today promotes 
an oppo ite point of view -
promiscuity, or just bas ically 
not really committinl! 10 

anything, live for today, 
everything is disposable, see 
ya later - so, lhat' really the 
way r~aw and Order IS meant. 
in term ' of personal la\\' and 
personal order that you can 
build your life by committing 
to things." 

Some cuts that were 
origi nally intended for Law 
and Order are finding 
themselves on the upcoming 
Fleetwood Mac album. 
Buckingham claims that there 
is no clear way of choosing 
w hich songs go where. It 

rhe lyrics of "Johnny Stew" 
are the result of a recording 
se sion with John Stewart. 
Buckingham produced hIS 
Bombs Away, Dream Babies 
album . "One night we were 
looking for lyric., and John 

tewart happened to drop by 
the studio. Somehow we 
. tarted si nging about Johnny 
Stew, joking, really. It went 
from there." 

Involving one elf In an 
individual effort also benefit 
work with a group, he says. 
"Both ways of working can 
help each ot her. [n the process 
of one you can learn 
things ... I'm applying thing ' 
I've learned doing the fAW and 
Order album to the next 
Fleetwood Mac album right 
now." Thi~ i a more 
"dimensional" way of working 
which offer alternative to 
the band mem ber in 
approach. 

Buckingham does not feel 
that Law and Order is that far 
way from Fleetwood Mac

The Evil One 
Roky Erickson 
415 Record ' 

BY MIKEL TOOMBS ("rr Writer 
A fine album has just been 

released from an ob 'cure 
figure of the '60 ' who is 
making a comeback. 

Roky (pronou nced "Rocky") 
Erickson fron ted a particu-
larly interesting '60s 
psychedelia band called th 
Thirteenth Floor Elevators. 
The Texas-based Eleva tors 
specialized in crazed, 
'ometimes demonic imagery, 

scoring a single major hit with 
Erickson's om inous "You're 
Gonna Miss Me. " That one 
song aside, t he group labored 
fruitlessly for several albums 
on a tiny local label , the 
hopefully-named Texas 
Int ernational Records. 

After leaving the Elevators, 
Erick 'on pretty much dropped 
out of sight. He surfaced 
sporadically to record a 'ongor 
two, 'uch a: the demented 
"Two-Headed Dog" (" I've 
been working in the Kremlin 

I ntramura I 'All Co llege ' 

wi th a two-headed dog" - ??), 
or to face a n occasional 
inlervi w, sometimes wit h 
detail s of his strange visions, 
more oft en WIt h answers like 
"Huh? What did you say?" In 
' hort, he seemed the 
archet vpal "acid casualt y." 

Roky - Erickson's comeback 
record is ca lled The Elli/ One. 
A quick glance indicates that 
it's true to expected form: that 
menacing title; songs like 
"Don' t hake Me Lucifer," "I 
Think of Demons ," "Crea-
ture:; with the Atom Brain"-
one ca n imagine Roky running 
cont inuous cheap horror flicks 
in t he back of what 's left of his 
mind - and "rr You Have 
Ghosts" ; and an album cover 
derived from the classic 
vampire film Nos/eml/( . 

There i s :,omet hing 
unforseen about The Ellil One, 
though. Roky Erickson doesn ' t 
sound like a raving lunatic 
here; hi s dE-livery is subdued 
and matter-of-fact. 

The Elli/ One is a triumph 
for Roky Erick 'on; he has 
proven himself as :;omeone to 
be watched very closely.

BY COTT ALLISON 
Se nior tall Writer 

When the du t finally 
settl ed Saturday evening at 
the conclus ion of the grueling 
two day UC 0 Invitational 
Tournament . the UCSD 
women's vo lley ball team , 
beaten in the finals yet proud 
nonetheless , s urpri sed 
everybody, except them selves 
perhaps. by wa lking away 
with a well-earned second 
place trophy in their hands. 

The fourth 'eeded Triton 
succumbed to a well -poli hed 
UC Davis quad in a superbly 
played finals match, 15- 13, 7-
15 and 11-15. The final match 
culminated a rigorou two-day 
competition , in which a little-
known (until this year) UCSD 
team fir st de po sed the 
tournament 's second seeded 
team, UC Rivers ide, in the 
emifinals, and then gave UC 

Davi , another nationall y 
ranked volleyball powerhou e, 
thescareofit lifeinthefinals. 

" We came as close to playing 
a perfect match as we could 
aga inst Ri verside," aid UCSD 
coach Doug Oannevik "and to 
beat Dav is we wou ld have had 
to do the sa me. It was an 
excell ent tournament for us." 

Although the entire Triton 
team played exceptionally well 
throughout the tournament, 
Loui'e (Lulu ) Sc hwartz, 

Tammy Smit and Mari ly Horn 
hined especia lly. 
The word i ' out: mit can 

hit. The ophomore from 
Anchorage, Al a ' ka hit the 
daylights out of the ball time 
and time again , thus earning 
her elf another tournament 
MVP award. In the champion-
s hip bracket alone, s he 
literall y carried the team with 
53 kill. and a .388 hitting 
average . 

"Un s toppable" wa the 
word Oannevik u ' ed to 
de. crib mit. "Awesome," 
said a' i ·tant coach Mike 
Hipp. Opposi ng team would 
cert ainl y agree.

Intramural refs: long hours, verbal abuse 
A closeup look at the job from the ref's point of view 

BY LARRY GOLDMAN 
A yellow flag is thrown -

the penalty an illegal block. 
The player g s up to the ref 
and cream, "you're crazy 
man! You don't know what the 
hell you are talking about..." 
The ref rebut , "Calm down or 
you are out of the game; 
anyway, the penalty i against 
the other team." 

Incident like this - the 
refer e getting abuse -
happen in virtually every 
intramural game . ome 
intramural ref were a ked 
how they handle this abuse 
and about refereeing in 
general. 

The consensus of what a ref 
wi ll do when he reCeives verba l 
abuse was summed up by Jim 
Berkson, who has refereed 
football, basketball. softball, 
and frisbee. He aid, "some 
r';!fs have a short fuse and take 
it (verbal abuse) personally 
and kick the player out of the 
game right awav. Mo. t of the 

referees, though, will give the 
player a warning and hope 
that he calms down ." 

Alan Friedman, who has 
refereed football, ba ketball, 
softball and volleyball, agreed 
with this ,but al 0 added that, 
"there are ome refs that 
antagonize the player and 
tho e few give a bad name to 
all refs." 

When a ked about the 
player ' complaint that a lot of 
the time the refs had seemed 
out of it or didn't care what 
was going on, both Berkson 
and Friedman agreed that it 
happen . The rea on why it 
happen ranged from the 
referee being hungover to the 
long shifts some refs have to 
work. 

Berkson said that when you 
are on a 4 or 5 hour shift it 
hard t o keep up th e 
concentration. "It's like when 
doing homework for a while; 
your mind get s overloaded and 
just shuts off."

Friedman said another 
reason the referee can lose 
in tere t is if the game is a bad 
one. 'It's just like watching a 
boring game on TV.. . You 
catch yourse lf not paying 
atlent ion." 

A possible solution to help 
thi problem would be to 
shorten shifts or hopefully to 
have one fresh ref working 
with one who is not. 

One thing said by the refs 
was that knowing the rule i 
not the most important virture 
in the eyes of the intramural 
department. According to the 
referees, the bottom line and 
top criteria for one, i ' the 
ability to keep a game under 
control. 

According to Friedman , in 
the good leagues the ref mll t 
know the rules because the 
teams do. In the lower leagues. 
though, a ref can get away 
without a great knowledge of 
the rules. 

Because of thi I he referees 
that get the most hours are the 

ones t hat can keep con t roJ. 
Un fort un ate ly too many 
referees really don't know the 
rules. For the big sports like 
football or basketball 
approximately 35 are hired. It 
i hard to get 35 qualified 
people who want to ref and 
because of thi Friedman ays, 
"there are a few refs who are 
incompetant and unfortu-
nately tho e few make a bad 
image for the rest . This makes 
the ref a loser before he even 
s tart ." 

The players ' view that 
ba 'ketball was the hardest 
, port to ref was confirmed by 
the referee '. They say that 
because it is so f~st moving, 
keeping control can be a 
problem. Also coed 'ports are 
tough be ause there are so 
many wierd rule '. 

What can be done toimprove 
player-referee relati onships? 
For on . quality of refereeing 
could be improved in football if 
it were possible to have three 
ref instead of two. Because

this doesn't seem economica lly 
feasible Friedman had t \va 
suggestions. 

Fir t if you are a referee you 
hould. "ref a game like you 

would want it to be refereed if 
you were a player in the 
game." Second, if you are a 
pl'ayer and have a complaint 
about the officiating, "go 
through your captain and have 
him bring the problem to the 
a lt en tion of the ref." 

Other s uggestion from the 
referees were that the players 
hould have a little more 

understanding because 
usually I he refs are trying 
their best . Peer pre ' ure is 
tough to handle and there is an 
open invitation for any player 
to tr\' 10 ref and see what it is 
like .. 

This year there have been 
alot of rookie referees but even 
\ ith that there ha n't . eemed 
to be too many big problems.

continued from page 10 
"Thi how a 'uprcme 

di . regard for human life," hc 
aid . America 's lead L are 

"making no significant effort 
to avoid war." 

A a p ychologist, Roger 
explained hi concern i what 
the thought of total annihi la, 
tion by nuclear war i doing to 
u now. The p~ychol()gical 
effects of nuclear war is a 
misnomer, he aid. "Dead 
bodi . have few p. ychological 
problem . 

"A nu c lear war i 
unthinkabl . E timate are a 
half billion people would be 
killed in the first exchange. 
The \\ ar wou ld last 30 to 60 
minutes," he aid. 

Ro r r" explamed·th effect 
ha\ e been to minimize the 
conflict a national lead r ' 
have done. To others. the 
thought of nuclear war ha: 
become trivial. An elect ronic 
video game ha been de:igncd 
with nll<,slles fallmg on citle .. 
he said. The deknders of the 
country try to desrroy the 
mi slle befor they hit the 
citi s. -

"I had to leave. It was more 
than I could take," Rogers 
saId. " It becomes a game -
oops, we ju. t lo.t a city an 
Di go? Detroit? 

For the young, the threat of 
destructIOn has become a 
black cloud [n a high school 
tudy. <,tudents \\ ere asked to 

write about where the\ 
envlslCmed themseh' s m fiv' 
to ten years, Rogers said. Of 

thos who wrote . half saw 
them elve as d ad. Many 
envi sioned a nu clear war or 
s ke of doing on thing or 
another "if Reagan ha. n't 
gotten us blown up." 

For Holling worth , the 
thought of urviving a nuclear 
war i unthinkabl . 

" [ don ' t want to be a 
survivor in a nuclear war we 
have won. I don 't want to 
there," he aid . "If you're a 
survivor. don 't come to me. 
There wi 11 be nOI h i ng 
medicine can do for you. 

"A standard bomb i 1,000 
kilotons or 70 times the 
Hiroshima bomb. If one hit 
Balboa Park, everyt hin g 
would be destroyed to Pacific 
Bea ch . Everything and 
eveyone under the bomb would 
be torn up." 

Debris would fly off and 
become weapon.. he ·said. 
• univors would fac 
pe. til nc . They \\.ould range 
the land with nothing and 
would face lingering death as 
their bo ne marrow and 
intestinal tract decayed . The 
term. "survival of the fittest" 
wou ld be given the time span 
of day. or week ... in ·tead of 
hundreds of years. he said. 
"If \\le a a nation . pent a. 

much on peacefu l interaction 
as e.,p nd on war. we would 
prevent the war \\hich hangs 
over us," Roger sa id. 

"Camp David show' 
changes can be brought about 
through talk."

Among the inItiative 
supporters. spints are high . 
An opinion poll, purpos Iy 
taken in San Diego, a city WIth 
a strong tilt toward the 
military. drew a 54 p rc nt

percent of those surveyed 
OPP()~ed the measure. de.' pite

Commentary on nuke

continue d from page 10 
and other. wer touched upon r discussed 
indirectly . Th convocation's overall me. sage was 
threefold : the present nuclear weapons. ituat ion is 
going from bad to worse, something mu t he don 
about it , and you mu. t do it. rt all com s down to 
people. 

The mo~t importan t a~pect of the convocation was 
t he people. Speaker Bob LiVIng -ton \J as not present 
as the former Chairman of the Deparment of 
Defens olloquium on the problem" of Command 
and Control. He \\. a~ on person telli ng other people 
about the problem of nuclear \ ar. This was true of 
the ot her speakers as well They callcd on the 
audi nce to make its If heard.

of the convocatIOn. Th aliforn la In itiati\c: 
Bilateral uclear Arm ' Freeze, the San Diego 

tudents for Peace. the Student Peace Educatu)J1 
Committee, the Peace R . ource Center and other 
organizations ar open to individuals who wish to 
berom in volved. 

Too often people feel helpless and unable to effect 
chang s. The speaker at t h convocation 
demonstrated what an individual an do: teach . 
learn. organize. a nd participate. They all commun-
icat d the underlying them of the convocation. if 
not in word, then in de d. 

The message was clear: gel involved . Become 
informed, find out a bout t he i~slles. make a decisIOn. 
and then act. The speakers st't the example and It 
remains only for I he audience, that i ', you and me. to
