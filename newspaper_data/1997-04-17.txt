Goodman works Wilh peptides, 
molecules related to proleins but 
normally luwer in molecu lar 
weight. Peplides act in a seemingly 
endless number of lasks in living 
ti ssue, from ~cnding messages to 
aCling as antibiotics. 

Since peptidcs have such a 
broad range of functions, they are 
extremely va luable to pharmaceuti -
cal companies. Goodman has dis-
covered new wa ys to synthes il.e 
and ~tudy these molecules, which 
makes the task of producing new 
drugs lIIuch ca~ier. 

"Our work has shown funda-

Revolution Slate Should 
Keep Campaign Promises 

For the second consecutive year. UCSD stude nts voted 
into the ASUCSD offices a working majority consisting 
of candidates from one of the large slates. 

Last year. the Students First! s late scored an over-
whelming victory over the U.N. I.T. . slate. This year the 
tide turned agai nst Students First! a~ the Revolution slate 
was ~ wept into office . 

We would like to congratulate all the candidates for their 
efforts and desire to improve the lives of U SO student~. 
All the campaigns managed to mailllain a level of di g nity 
that i~ sorely lacking in the vast majority of our national . 
state and local dection~ featuring professional politicians. 

We would also like to co ngratulate the Revolution 
members on their victory. Their job has only just begun. 
and it is important that our ne wly e lec ted represelllatives 
remember the reason they were voted int their offices : 
to d everything in their power to address the daily con-
cerns of UCSO students. 

The Revolulion platform promised to c hange the coun-
cil's funding priorities in favor of programming and stu-
dent organizations, to push for expanded student parking 
and to Iry 10 increase funding for student services and 
financial aid. 

II is important that the cou nci l work togt:ther to 
accompl ish these goals, with each e lected representative 
serving for the entire term of office. The infighting that 
has plagued previous administra ti ons should not be 
a llowed 10 bog down these objecti ves. 

We encourage our new representatives to conlinue to 
distinguish themsl!1ves by keeping their campaign promis-
es to the student body. and accomplishing their goals for 
UCSD. 

Judges' Overruling Stops 
Illegitimate 209 Concerns 

Last Tuesday, a th ree-judge panel of the U.S . Courr of 
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned U.S. District 
Judge Thellon Henderson 's recent injunc tion against 
Propos ition 209. In December. Henderson ruled that 209 
violutes the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection clause. 
Obviously the Consti tution does not require that states 
pursue preferential policies, so why the constitutiona l 
concern about 209? 

The key issue in this case pertains to the way in which 
Californians went aboU( abolishing race- a nd gender-
preference programs. Proposition 209 amended the state 
constitution so that affirmative-action programs cannot 
be enacted at the state or loca l level without re-amending 
the stale consti tution . According to Henderson. forcing 
women and minorities to re-amend the state constitut ion 
in order to e nact policies they favor is an unconstitution-
a ll y discriminatory political burden . 

So the lega l question does not concern the consti tu -
tionality of aJfirma/ive action, but the constitutiona lity of 
the way in which Cali fornians aboli shed affirmative 
action . The 209 case is about politica l procedure - not 
whelher affirmative action as a policy is right or wrong . 

However, these procedural concerns are bogus. It's 
only fair tha t a referendum cpn o nly be overturned by 
another referendum. The Ninth Circuit judges who over-
ruled Henderson are to be applauded. Nevertheless. 209 
opponents will not give up until the U.S. Supreme Court 
delivers a ruling in Ihis case. For thi s reason , the court 
shou ld revicw the 209 case as soon as possible. Only after 
a definitive decision has been rendered can our society 
get beyond thi s divisive issue.

Pat. I'd like 10 buy a "why," please. 
Why ,hould we care aboul somebody's sexual orien-

DeGeneres wanled to have the character she plays on

that the character of Ellen Morgan 
would indeed come out in a special 
one-hour episode on the last day of 
April , just in time for sweeps. 

Pundits shake Iheir heads: Does 
Ellen Morgan's coming out in what is 
sti ll our most massive medium legit-

financial backing of a bottom-line 
business like ABC merely reflect its 
acceptance by a significant portion of

"For me," she says, "this has been

GRAPHIC ABORTION PICTURES PORTRAY REALITY 
Editor: 

Thank you for addressi ng the 
abortion i s.~ue in an intelligent man-
ner ("Drawing the Ad Line," Apr. 14, 
I Y97). Abortion i ~ one of those issues 
that seem~ to evoke strong feelings 
from people on hath sides of the 

is~ue. It should be dealt with "deli -
cately," but without Ignoring truth. 

The university has always been a 
place where e~ta bli shed ideologies 
have been !:hallenged. ThiS i ~ very 
important in allowing individual to 
examine their be li l:f, more closely. 
Tim , hould be true rcgardle,~ of the 
is,ue. It is your obligati on to present 
opini ons on controversial ~ubject " 
even though some people may 
object, not because they' re offe nd-
ed, but be!:au~e they disagn:e -
that 's a side effe(;t of free speecll . 

If the ad in question was nothing 
but lie,. I would say, "Don't print it." 

GAY: Ellen 's 
stunt will not greatly 
change society 
ContInued from page 4 
day around the episode. 

Thi~ i, not to say that J do not 
sympathize with the plight of gay 
men and women. I do . You deal 
wi th fo lks like the Rev. Jerry 
Fa lwell. who referred lO 
DeGeneres as "Ellen DeGenerate," 
and frolll the Rev. Donald E. 
Wildmon, whosc American Family

<.:O il DeGencres ' advertisers. 

But , I've secn the ad in the past and 
all it docs is remind us that abortion 
is a reality and it docs result in dead 
fetuses. These arc facts. The proce-
dures used by abort ioni sts are real. 
Just like the fi 1m "Scbindler's List" 
used a graphic account of the 
Holocaust to empha,ize the tragedy, 
so do some "pro-life" groups. to 
emphasize what they believe to be a 
tragedy. "Biased" terms like "abor-
tion mill ," while certainly subjec-
ti ve. arc nOl fal se. 

If pcople are moved by the 
image" pcrhap, it wil l prompt them 
10 rethink or strengthen their opi n-
ion, . Isn't think ing what universities 
are all abou t? We <.:an' t run away 
from issues. no maller how disturb-
ing . Ith ink it would be a great injus-
tice to turn away a paid advertise-
ment endorsing a valid opinion.

You live in a world where hetero-
sexuals are refcrred to as "straight" 

(a~ if there was ,omething "crooked" 
about bei ng gay). 

You arc bombarded by unwanted 
heterosexual imagery from adver-
tisement s. If you enter the corporate 
world, you wa lk on eggshells and 
learn 10 avoid discussions of mar-
riage. children and "that ni ce young 
manflady" atthc company party wi th 
whom you were seen. You are still an 
objcct of curiosity in many circles 
and arc oftentimes the pariah to your

Editor: 
I appreciate your di lem ma in 

deciding whether or not to run an 
ad that has hi storically been so con-
trove rsial. However. people shou Id 
be exposed to arguments on both 
sides of the emotional and contro-
versial issue of abortion, even if it 
means being expo ed to unpleasant 
images. The fact is that these pi c-
tures represent what really happens 
in an abortion . If they were draw-
ings "made up" as innammalOry 
propaganda, the Guardian would 
have legi timate cause to refuse to 
run the add. Howe ver. these are 
rea l photographs - presented to 
arg ue a pos iti on, yes, but real. If 
one is to fully support lega lized 
aborti on. one cannot deny or refuse 
to fa<.:e the physical reality of the 
process. 

No one enjoys looki ng at such 

with a host of ugly stereotypcs and 
fi nd yourse lf constantly balliing 
them in the face of ignorant class-
mates. co-workers and bosses. You 
endu re needless suspicion and seruti-
ny in the company of people of your 
gender, as if being gay means you 
have an insatiable appetitc for any-
one of the same sex. 

You must make all the compro-
mi ses in your interac tion ' , and are 
rarely appreciated for your 
Herculean effort s to fit into a hos-
til c, or at be t, indifferent. hetero-
sex ual world. • 

I undersland. 
But those of you who are seeking 

graphic photographs. They bring 
disgust and pain to those who 
believe that abortion is the taking 
of a human life just as much as 
those who are pro-choi ce. But 
graphic photographs and descri p-
tions have always been used to 
make people confront the unpleas-
ant rea lity of what is happening in 
violent situations to bring to light 
the horror of war or the suffering 
in famine-stri cken areas. 

The Guardian is not forcing 
readers to look at the insert , rather, 
it is giving readers a chance to, as 
you wrote, "expose fthemselves]lO 
all sides of the debate. " Even if one 
is an ardent supporter of lega li zed 
abortion . one must make an effort 
to understand the totality of what 
one is supporting to form an edu-
cated opinion.

1996. That case remains unsolved. 
There have been a handful of 

in-home rapes in UCSD's history, 
most recently involving a graduate 
student at the Mesa Apartments. In 
that July 1994 incident, the gradu-
ate student raped a visiting female 
acquaintance in hi s rodm. The vic-
tim pre sed charges and the stu-
dent was ultimately convicted. 

In 1989, two female juveniles 
attending a camp in July were 
raped in their Reve lle Mud Huts 
room following a party. Jones said 
the rapist was also an acquaintace 
of the victims and that the victims 
dec lined to pursue criminal prose-

LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES 
Australian film about five college students falls flat 

By Mark Palansky 
Staff Wnter 

A 25-year-old director, no 
script. li ve dilettante a,turs and no 
money were the ingredient s that the 
producers hoped would be the stan 
01 wmething hi g. In Aus-
tra lia, more money is 
~pent fixing ,a r~ dam-
aged by kangaroos th,1O 
on films. From that hUJII -
ble backgrou nd come 
many determined film -
makers who drea m of 
making it hi g. 

Emma-Kate Croghan 
is one of those hopefuls. and her 
dreams became rea lity in Fox 
Searc hl ight's new film "Love and 
Other Catastrophes." 

"Love and Other Catastrophes" 
follows the plights of live college 
~tuden t struggling to get through 
their daily live~. 

Alice (Alice Garner) is a fru~­
tra ted perfectioni st who is four 
years late wi th her thesis, "Doris 
Day as a Feminist Warrior." Mia 
(Frances O'Connor) is drowning in 
bureaucratic hass les and has just 
broken up with her girlfriend Danni 
(Radha Mi tche ll ). who has no 
direction at all . 

Ari (Mallhew Dyktynski) is a 
literature major who makes hi s 
money as a ma le prostitute. Lastly. 
Michael (Mall Day ), is a soc ia ll y 

inept medical student li vi ng in a 
house from hell . All their lives 
interconnect and begin to so rt 
them~e l ves out in trite and uninter-
esting way~ . The best thing about 
thi s film IS the budget. "Catastro-

phes" utilized a mere 
$30,000 and 17 days for 
it s productions. and that 
is its main appea l. 

"We wanted to catt:h 
the same spirit that you 
get in American indepen-
dent cinema," Croghan 
says. "We were looking 10 
make omething with real

Lndeed, the Plaids jell, lending 
their boyish charm to the compli -
cated and hilarious staging and 
music. In a medley of "Sixteen 
Ton " and "Chain Gang," Smith 
uses a bollie of Hei nz ketchup to 
provide percussion. The other 
Plaid do similar anti cs in 
Como's "Catch A Falling Star:' 
in which two spoons are used to 
hammer out the beat. 

The audience is also treated to 
a rousing rendilion of "Lady of

Bl ack Umfolosi, a perfor-
mance tro upe from Zimbabwe, 
brought the mu ic and dance of its 
homeland to a packed audience at 
Mandeville Auditorium last Fri-
day nigh!. The group 's two-part 
show featured a cappella music 
fro m the Ndebele region of Zim-
babwe and traditional dance 
accompanied by drums. 

As the show opcned. eight men 
walked onto a bare stage. Dressed 
in simple costumes, they immedi -
ately began a program of songs in 
Ndebele, English and Zulu. Syn-
chroni zed movement s of the 
hands and feet enhanced the rich, 
smooth harmonies in the tradition-
al African ca ll and response pat -
tern. Song leader Sotsha Moyo 
and his brother, tour leader Lucky 
Moyo. kept the audience interest-
ed with jokes and workshops in 
the Ndebele language. 

The songs ranged from "The 
Hour," about young lovers about to 
manry, to "When Shall War .. . ?," 
dedicated to nature. human ri ghts 
and universal peace. "Hele le 
Mama," celebrates the diversity of 
cultures in Africa. During thi song, 
the members of Black Umfolosi 
were introduced. each perfomling 
an impromptu dance that beautiful-
ly blended traditional dancc with

Thc dance was expanded in the

to a standing ovation. 

-*. * •• 

It ·s amazing to think that a band 
with no guitars could become an 
underground success. However. 
Morphine has pulled it off. Like 
Swimming, the fo llow-up to the 
Bostonian trio's 1995 masterpiece, 
yes, demonstrates why. 

Headed by the t wo-st ring fret-
less bass and voca ls o r Mark 
Sandman and the sexy, sultry bari -
tone saxophone ho ks of Dana 
Colley, Morphine continues to 
lwi st entrancing and hypnoti c 
tunes that dabble in the provoca-
tive. Sandman 'S sliding bass lines 
are car-catching on such lracks as 
" 1 Know You (Pt. III )" and "Hang-
ing On A Curtain." 

Sandman ' stirring vocals add 
to Morphine's delectable sound. 
taking li steners on a sonic journey. 
Colley's sax gives the album's 
tracks the lonel y Morphine-esque 
feci. as in "Empty Box" and the 
hartl-driven "Eleven O'Clock" -
two of the album's best songs. On 
the laller, heavy sax and hasslines 
wind around Sandman's repeated 
line. "Every night around II 
o 'c lock ... I go out. " 

Like Swimmillg makes you fccl 
like you' re Iloating in some son of 
sensual bli s. Or maybe you ' ve 
been given a dose of Morphine - a 
band at its beSI.

Ri ghteous Babe Records has 
upplied millions of fans with the 

music of Ani DiFranco, but as yet. 
no studio recording has done justice 
to the musi ' of thi s talented anisl. • 
DiFrant:O is a musician who empha-
sizes the spontanei ty of live music 
in her unforgettable performances. 
Livillg III Clip. hcr latest release, 
contains two hou rs of live mu ic 
from ovcr a dozen venues. 

The album's diversity is refresh-
ing. DiFranco has induded a elec-
tion of prev ious ly unrecorded 
tracks, experiments wi th old 
favoritcs and a few examples of the 
random tangents she takes wi th her 
joke and stories. 

The album opens with "Gravel." 
the lirst song wriUen after her pre-
vious re lease. Dilate. DiFranco 
also indudes a once-performed 
song that had never been recorded, 
"Hide and Seek." 

The admirable aspects of the 
album are the sound quality and the 
lack of audience noise. There are a 
few crowd reactions sampled on the 
album. but not enough to distract 
from the music. A photo album also 
accompanies the CD, illustrati ng

JELLY ROLL! 
Play celebrates life and work a/jazz pianist 

By Sehra Han 
Staff Writer 

"Jelly Roll' ." a mu 'ieal tribute 
to jaZl. pianist Ferdi nand "Jelly 
Roll" Morton. rolled a jazz history 
lesson, stand-up comedy rout ine 
and piano coneen into one sweet .. 
trea t performance for a pleased 
Mandevi lle Auditorium crowd 
Sunday night. 

The show opened to an entirely 
dark lheater, where somehow the 
mystery piani t's fingers deftly 
found their way through the dark a ' 
a tunc drifted throughout the theater. 
Paul Asaro. who played the Profes-
sor, pccializes in ragtime and jaa 
piano and has played on the Delta 
Queen Rlverhoal OU I of ew 
Orkans. His sensatIOnal. toe-tapping 

rhythm~ arc sign<ltun.: 10 Ihe borde 1-

himself were li ~t.:ning from some .. 
where in the greal Meyond. he would 
have raised an eydlrow or two. 

Kirk Taylor. who has hecn on 

MUSIC 
TRADER 

~creen in "Full Metal Jackel" and 
on stage with a number of Broad-
way tours, played the languid . 
superstitious and irrepressibly ego-
tistical Jelly Roll Morton. 

"Damn, I'm good," he pro-
claims. "I and I alone created jazz 
as we know it today." 

Asaro and Taylor, two talented 
performers. created a seri es of 
perfectly coordinated, short 
sketches based on Morton's life. 
With musica l accompaniment 
rrom Asaro, Taylor told stories of 
how Jelly Roll first heard jazz 
from a woman missing the halves 
of two fingers. of how he used to 
strut down Ih l! street in fine suit s 
and hats and of the voodoo ritua ls 
he wilnessed . 

A red overhead hght . two feath .. 
er tlLl~la~ and ~ome Inose 1ll0Vl!S 
were all Taylor needed tu recreate 
the ~hal1lan's voodoo riluallhat got 
Morton his first MIg hreak al a nlly 
horde II o. Later 10 hi, hfe. Morton 

blamed hi s railure to make it as big 
as cenain other "Iaughably inferior 

musician~," such as Cab Calloway 
and Duke Ellington, on hi s fa ilure 
to pay the shaman. 

Believing he was hexed, Morton 
was tricked into CUlling up and 
burning all or his fancy clothing to 
rid himselr of the curse. Chuckling, 
Tay lor shook his head and sa id. "I 
hould have known beller." 

[n between the stories, Taylor 
sang while Asaro played . ome of 
Monon's original ongs, ranging 
from blues to scat. The music was as 
Ilashy. melancholy. humorous and as 
diverse as the man who wrote it. 

Monon used to si ng one partic-
ularly m~morahl e ,ong, "Nearer 
My God to Thee," whilc in a quar-

Drimmer and Kelli Tsai fini shed 
the sweep at the No.3 spot with an 
8·6 victory over Pomona's N-o. 3 
duo of Laura Scher and Heather 
Gorman. 

" It 's the doubles that made it 
happen today." As istant Coach Dan 
Brounstein said . "We've been prac-
ticing on doubles two to lhree times 
a week recently, and it's paid ofr. I 
think it also makes a difference when 
'you have a selline-up and the teams 
have played wi th each other for a 
while." 

All UCSD needed to do in the 
singles compet ition was wrestle 
away two matches for the victory.

from the baseline, ultimately tiring 
Gorman out , 6-0, 6-2. 

Nguyen did not waste any time

Aztecs Leave Tritons Gasping for Air 
WWPA: After an 11-5 loss to SDSU, the Tritons need to defeat UC Santa Barbara at the Western Qualification Tournament 
By Jonah Nisenson 
Staff Writer 

Practi ce makes perfect is a 
phrase that has been drilled into 
the head of athletes ever si nce 

lillie league. Whil e 
some may view th l! 
phrase as a plati -
tude, tnere is some 
truth to the state-
ment. Through prac-
tice, one ca n expect 
to improve, ex~el 
and move toward 

perfecti on. even if perfection can 
never actually be attained. 

One could look at the UCSD 
women ' s water polo team and its 
2- 12 record. and fooli 'hly assume 
that it s season is shot. That would 
be inane, especially I:On idering 
UCSD has the chance to advance 
10 Nationals next weekend in the 
Western Qualification Tourna-
ment on Apri I 27. 

While they will have trouble 
matching up against the likes of 
UCLA and UC Berkeley , the Tri -
tons wi II have a great opportunity 
to advance as seven out of eight 
wmpeting teams qualify for Na-
tional s. To appreciate thi s season, 
one must look atlne improvement s 
thi s team nas made in every fa cet 
of its game. 

So lace could be found even in 
an 11 -5 loss on Wednesday to San 
Diego State University as UCSD 
improved immensely on its previ -
ous showi ng against the Aztecs. A 

few Triton mental errors ea rly on 
led to severa l easy point s for 
SDSU. However, UCSD never 
looked like they were being used . 

Whereas in the past they have 
had trouble making clean emr 
passes against the Aztecs. the Tri -
tons made su ccess i ve pa~s es 
throughout the set. Defense has 
also become steadi I y more aggres-
sive, forcing more turnovers lately 
than during the earl y weeks of the 
season . 

Unfortunately , the Tritons have 
not improved their shooting. On 
Wednesday, the shooting woes 
continued as the Tritons finished 
the game having made only 20 
percent of their shots . 

"Our team has improved im-
mensely ince the last time we 
played State," sophomore Alice 
Huszez said. "Our defense is there, 
our swimming i there, but we are 
having trouble just pUlling the ball 
in the cage." 

Senior Shawna Caballero and 
sophomore Kathryn Ozaki each 
scored a pair of goals during tne 
contest. while freshman Megan 
Walli s scored one goal in the first 
quarter. 

The Tritons suffered a tough 
blow with the loss of junior Kelly 
Gi Ibraith , who did not play in the 
game because of are-aggravated 
jaw injury that occurred in last 
week' practice . Gilbraith must sit 
out tne remainder of the eason. 

This weekend , th e Triton 

women will travel to Santa Bar-
bara for a galile that will have a 
huge effect on 1 heir con fidence 
level. The Gauchos have handed 
the Tritons three defeats this year, 
two of which were heart -breaking 
losses in overllme. Hopefully the 
Tritons will turn thi s Irend arou nd 
at We tern Qualificati ons Tour· 
nament and advance 10 ationals . 

"We definitely have a chance 
at Western Qualifications next 
weekend." Caballero said. "But 
we need to play really well this 
weekend to gel some confidence 
under our belt. " 

In addition to the contest against 
the Gauchos. th e women's polo 
team will play in the UC Santa 
Barbara "B" Tournament. which 

will allow everyone to get some 
much needed playing time before 
the big game aga inst Santa Bar-
bara Friday afternoon . 

"If we win. it will give us a lot 
more hope than we would have 
otherwise at Western Qual' ," 
Hu szez sa id. "A win over Santa 
Barbara will definitely brighten 

Triton out of water: Sophomore Jenny Irwin was not able to put a ball into the net against SDSU.

However. Tuesday would not be the Tri -

of a three-game seri es, the Kingsmen broke a

Knowing pi tching would be crucial to the

SALUTE: In the last game of the 1997 season, UCSD's most successful ever, the Tritons could not defeat rival San Diego State 
By Steve Walsh 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

A strong consti tution: The char-
acter trait any team mu t possess 
when it play in a conference laden 

wi th enonnous talent. 
Take th e UCSD 
men' s vo ll ey ball 
team, for example. 
Des pite be ing the 
only Divisio n III 
school in a confer-
ence packed fro m top 
to bOllom wi th na-

tionally ranked Di vision I team , 
the Tritons held their own on the 
way to their most successful season 
in school history. 

This may be attri butcd to thei r 
strong constitution. However; as ev-
ery student of history knows. with a 
strong constitut ion must ~ome a pow-
erful preamble. And while UCSD did 
not scri pt this, it does li t the bill.

Could the Tritons have formed a 
more perfect union'! While UCSD 
did not possess all of the natura l 
talent t hat its opponents had, the 
Tritons had top-notch tcam chemi s-
try. This allowed each member to 
play hi, role effectively and pro-
vided Head Coach Du ncan 
McFarland wi th thc oppurtunity to 
get the opti mal li neup on the court 
for every situati on. 

"The personalities on this team 
just clicked," senior midd le blocker 

Matt Minehan said. "Everybody sup-
ported everybody else." 

.... . establish justice .. . " 
For the seniors on the squad. 

who suffered though years of de-
moralizing losses. justice was served 
in 1997. UCSD k.nocked off two top 
10 teams, USC and Long Beach 
State. in a two-week period. As a 
result . they recei ved votes in the 
Di vision I national rankings. The 
Tritons were featured in Volleyball 
magazine and were ranked No. I in 
the nation for Di vision III. 

'T hi s year was more than I ever 
dreamed," se nior outside hiller Eric 
Mai said. " ~ I didn ' t expect 10 play 
thi s tough. I' m really proud of my 
teammate ' because we proved that 
we could do it."

This yearRIMAC was the height 
of domes ti c tranquillity. UCS D 
played its best vo lleyba ll in fronl of 
the home crowd. Both upset wins 
came on its home floor. It also played 
tough agai nst UCLA, Pacific and 
UC Santa Barbara. The Tritons 
pushed the Gauchos to fi ve games 
befo re being narrowly edged out in 
ra lly scori ng. 

"We never expected to 10 e," 
Mi nehan said. "We went out and 
worked hard and everyone had a 
positi ve alt itude."

With a much smaller lineup than 
the majority of their opponents, the 

Tritons were forced to rely on their 
defensive aoilitieS to save points. 
Facing teams whose front lines av-
eraged6'S". UCSD's back row play-
ers had todig a large numbcrofballs 
throughout the match, The Tritons 
excelled in thi s rale, routinely dig-
gi ng more balls than their oppo-
nents. This translated into more scor-
ing opportuni ties for UCSD. 

The Tritons also managed to de-
fend with a fa irly successful block-
ing game. Led by Minchan and jun-
ior Guy Mount , the UCSD frontline 
was able to get its hand on the ma-
jori ty of swings by the opposition. 
The Triton bigmen were also helped 
out by sellers Satao Minami and 
Kurt Scckington. who. despite their 
height disad vantage. proved capable 
of making blo~ks .

taken lightly. 

The Tri tons closed out their year 
wi th a hard-foughl loss to cross-

of a packed hous..: at RIMAC, UCSD 
made a dramatic comcback in game

comparison~ have been made 
between Robln~on\ accom-
pli shment and W(l()d'~ feat at 
Augu~ta. 

With Tiger-man"l sweepll1g 
the nation, PreSident Bill Clinton 
invited him to attend the 
Robin~on ce lebration at • hea 

tadium 111 ew York on 
Tue~day night. He would hav' 
been there with ' linton, 
Robinson 's WIOOW Racbel and 
acting (pupp,et) commissioner 
Bud elig. That IS amating 
company. 

When Tiger declined. he 
received cri ticism. There are two 
main reasons why he declined. 

First, Tiger is a mart man -
he attended Stanford. He knows 
that placing himself in that 
company at Shea would draw 
even more comparisons to 
Jackie. Tiger knows the 
significance of his accompli h-
ment could never compare to 
Robinson's feat. Tiger recog-
nizes what lackie did, and the 
direct impact it had on him.
