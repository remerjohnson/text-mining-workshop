THE LINEUP

The secret is finally out: Alternative rock band Silversun Pickups will headline the main stage of Sun God Festival on Friday, May 18 and German electronic dance music producer Paul van Dyk 
is set to headline the dance stage, A.S. Concerts & Events 
revealed to the Guardian on Friday.

Other artists for the annual party’s main stage include 
Chiddy Bang, Ra Ra Riot, Macklemore and Ryan Lewis, Dia 

Frampton, Murs and Battle of the Bands 
winner Alier and the Band, while the 
dance stage lineup includes Tommy Trash, 
Tokimonsta, Clockwork, Oliver, Yarek and 
DJ battle winner Break North.

“I think it’s easy to tell that we have a 
greater emphasis on the dance stage this 

year and that’s just reflective of current trends among stu-
dents,” Associate Vice President of Concerts & Events Oliver 
Zhang said.

According to Zhang, ASCE has been trying to book 
Silversun Pickups for years, and the booking of Paul van 
Dyk — who festival coordinator Eric Babajanian referred to 
as a “trance god” — was the result of the office “seizing an 
opportunity.”

“In general, we just wanted to provide a pretty diverse 
range of acts,” Zhang said. “I think this is noticeable on both 
stages. With the dance stage there are acts like Oliver, who’s 
more nu-disco and indie dance. Then there’s Tokimonsta, 
which is more Low End Theory, beat scene-esque. Tommy 
Trash is electro house. Clockwork is also electro. For [main 
stage acts] Chiddy Bang, Macklemore and Murs we were 
just getting different types of hip hop — Chiddy Bang being 
a more poppy option, Murs being a more legitimate, hip hop 
fan’s artist and Macklemore bridging those different gaps.”

Zhang said that the lineup selection this year placed a

The moderate, transportation-

2012 A.S. Elections, taking three of the 
four top seats and four of eight cam-
puswide senatorial positions.

TIDE presidential candidate and 
Marshall College junior Meggie Le was 
elected by a margin of 794 votes after 
two rounds of single-transferable vot-
ing, and TIDE candidates Olamide 
Noah and Bryan Cassella were elected 
into the Vice President of External 
Affairs and Vice President of Finance 
and Resources positions, respectively. 
Sixth College senior Cody Marshall, 
who ran as an independent, took the 
Vice President of Student Life seat.

All four of the TIDE’s campus-wide 
senatorial candidates —  Irene Chang, 
Jackie Clavin, Savini Ganhewa and 

Matthew Mayeda — were elected into 
office. The remaining campus-wide 
senators are Brad Segal, Caeser Feng 
and Baldeep Dhaliwal of Bold, and 

Summer Rose Perez 
of Student Voice.

In the single-
transferable vot-
ing system, voters 
are asked to rank 
the candidates. If a 
student’s first-place 
candidate does not 

receive enough voters, the vote is 
transferred to his or her second-place 

candidate, and so on.
In the presidential race, indepen-

dent candidate Ali Athar was defeated 
in the first round, with 380 votes. 
Student Voice candidate Elizabeth 
Garcia was defeated in the second 
round, with 1237 votes. Bold candi-

UC Davis Pepper Spray 
Report Released to Public
BY ZEV HURWITZ
Associate News Editor

The deliberate pepper spraying of 
Occupy movement protesters at UC 
Davis last November was unnecessary 
and campus police and UCD adminis-
trators are to blame, a report released 
Sunday said. 

The report, compiled by a task 
force led by former California Supreme 
Court Justice Cruz Reynoso, concludes 
that the university could have done 
more to prevent the incident.

“Our overriding conclusion can be 
stated briefly and explicitly,” the report 
stated. “The pepper spraying incident 
that took place on Nov. 18, 2011 should 
and could have been prevented.”

The report condemned the actions 
of several individuals, including UCD 
Police Chief Annette Spicuzza and 
more directly, Lt. John Pike — the on-
duty officer who was filmed spraying 
the protesters with pepper spray as 
they blocked a pathway. Videos of Pike 
went viral last year, and he has widely 
been considered the face of the pepper 
spray incident.

The report also found that UCD 
Chancellor Linda Katehi could have 
been more proactive in the planning 
phases of handling of the protests.

The latter portion of the report 
outlines recommendations for univer-
sity policy changes that would prevent 
similar events from occurring. The 
bulk of the recommendations consist 
of UCD setting up more structured 
dialogue with student leaders to work 
together during future discrepancies. 

It is also recommended that UCD 
administrators set up an “office hours” 
model for becoming more accessible to 
concerned students. 

The report, which was released in a 
downloadable format on April 11, had 
been completed and slated for release 
in early March. UCD Police had filed 
for an injunction against the release in 
early March, fearing that some officers’ 
privacy would be breached. 

On March 28, California Superior 
Court Judge Evelio Grillo ruled that 
the report could be released as-is 
immediately, pending appeal. When 
no appeal was filed, the task force pro-
ceeded with the release.

UC President Mark Yudof released 
a statement on April 11 saying he 
looked forward to working with UCD 
and Chancellor Katehi to prevent simi-
lar incidents from happening.

slate. Of course we knew that people 
from every slate would be elected, but 
we don’t want it to be a repeat of two 
years ago.”

This year’s voter turnout was 21.06 
percent, according to A.S. Advocate 
General Courtney Hill. This is a signif-
icant decrease from both the 27.5-per-
cent general election turnout in 2011, 
and the 51-percent D-I referendum 
turnout last month.

“The voter turnout was a lot lower 
this year, but it’s on track for a year that 
had no referendum,” Hill said. “I’m just 
glad we broke 20 percent.”

Marshall College — where the 
majority of the TIDE executive can-
didates are from — had the highest 
voter turnout at 22 percent, followed 
by Muir, Revelle, Warren, ERC, Sixth.

No slates filed grievances this year, 
a stark contrast to the 2011 elections, in 
which grievance proceedings delayed 
the election results for three days.

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, APRIL 16,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

BY MEGGIE LE
A.S. President-Elect

These past four months have truly been an amazing and unforgettable experience. 
This year, we have seen a truly 
diverse, not divisive, council be 
elected into office. I am proud to 
say that next year’s council will be 
able to accurately represent our 
diverse UCSD community. My 
hope for A.S. Council this year is to 
take a more direct role in students’ 
lives as well as a more active role in 
student movements. I fully believe 
that A.S. Council should be for the 
students, by the students and that is 
something I want to instill in each 
and every council member this year.

A couple of the initiatives I have 
for this upcoming year surround 
transportation and external affairs.

In the midst of a transportation 
budget deficit, it is the job of the 

Associated Students to work in 
students’ interests and protect the 
services we hold so dear. When 
students are late to class because 
a shuttle — which had been filled 
to capacity by the time it reached 
their stop — was unable to stop for 
them, it is completely unacceptable. 
We are students and it is our job to 
learn. When the quality of services 
prevents us from doing so, it is 
neither fair nor acceptable by any 
stretch of the imagination. My first 
action as A.S. President will be 
to initiate conversations with the 
Transportation Director to see what 
steps we, as a university, can take 
to protect the shuttles, ‘S’ spots and 
MTS passes. Student services like 
transportation should be kept free 
— they should never be things we’re 
required to pay extra for.

Another focus I have for the 
upcoming year is external affairs. 
The other executive officers and I 

see the importance of establishing 
a lasting relationship with local and 
state government officials. These 
relationships link with any initiative 
students want to see pass. Whether 
it’s Greek housing or the prevention 
of fee hikes, local and state 
government officials have influence 
and can help us achieve our goals. 
We only need to show them that 
students have power as well; we can 
get them into office and we can just 
as easily get them out.

With a council filled with 
members of different slates, I really 
want to work on inner-council 
relations so that we can get past 
slate politics and work together to 
make a positive impact for students. 
I promise that the other executive 
officers and I will do our best to see 
this through.

I am excited to start working 
with the new chancellor and 
establishing a new dynamic 

in students’ relationship with 
the administration. The other 
executives and I will make sure 
this year is an unforgettable year. 
We promise to serve you and push 
A.S. Council into a direction that 
hasn’t been seen before. Council 
is going to do big things next year 
and I have so much faith in this 
council and our campus to make 
real change.

I know I wouldn’t be here 
without the love and support of all 
my friends and family as well as the 
students who voted for me. Thank 
you to all the voters who have put 
their faith in me. Thank you for this 
opportunity to lead our university 
and I promise that this year’s A.S. 
Council will not let you down.

I hope that you all are as excited 
to be a part of history in the making 
as I am. This is the dawn of a new 
age and we promise to leave a legacy 
all students can be proud of.

The Associated Students of UC Berkeley voided a ballot initiative this past 
Wednesday that would have asked 
students to pay $2 per semester to 
support the campus newspaper, the 
Daily Californian. If the council 
had approved the Vitalizing Online 
Information and Community 
Exchange (V.O.I.C.E.) for inclusion 
on the election ballot, and students 
voted to pass the referendum, Cal 
students would have paid the fee 
for the next five years in order to 
alleviate roughly half of the Daily 
Cal’s current $200,000 deficit. 
As a member of the Guardian, I 
empathize with the Daily Cal’s 
deficit situation — the Internet 
age has made times tough for all 
newspapers, especially ones run by 
college students, and the Guardian 
is currently struggling with its own 
financial difficulties. In the best 
of times, and in the spirit of free 
press, the Daily Cal would be able 
to maintain its full independence 
from the university. Although the 
referendum language states that the 
funds cannot be tampered with, 
there is always the concern that 

university funding would detract 
from a truly free press.

Ever since the Daily Cal became 
independent from UC Berkeley 
in the 70s, the staff has taken 
pride in the fact that it is funded 
entirely by its own advertising. This 
referendum would have blurred 
the lines between a public and an 
independent organization — an 
organization that receives funding 
from mandatory student fees can 
hardly pass as “independent.”  
Blurring these lines would unfairly 
deteriorate the notion of a free and 
competitive publications market at 
UC Berkeley, giving the Daily Cal 
the privilege of being both student-
funded and independent of school 
oversight. Granted, in drafting the 
referendum, the Daily Cal seemed 
ready to accept the consequences of 
university support, even if it meant 
the loss of its free status. But if the 
Daily Cal hopes to maintain its 
status as an independent newspaper, 
then it must accept the fact that 
dealing with tough sustainability 
reforms on its own is part of being 
an independent newspaper. 

In the end, the V.O.I.C.E. 

initiative turned out to be illegal. 
On Wednesday, the ASUC at UC 
Berkeley rejected the referendum  
for breaking Section 87.00 of the UC 
system fee regulations, which states 
that the referendum process “shall 
not be used to establish a new fee 
for the purpose of supporting a non-
university organization.”  

After the rapid expansion of 
online resources and social media 
outlets, the entire field of print 
journalism has been struggling to 
stay afloat. According to a 2009 
article in the magazine Editor and 
Publisher, the newspaper industry in 
the United States has lost one-fifth of 
its journalists since 2001. Many large 
newspaper chains since December 
2008 have filed for bankruptcy, 
such as the Tribune Company, 
the Minneapolis Star Tribune and 
Philadelphia Newspapers LLC. 
The biggest hit to print journalism 
has been a loss in advertisement 
revenue, as previous clients became 
more inclined to promote themselves 
via social media and other online 
sources. According to the Newspaper 
Association for America, Print 

I n the not-so-distant future, you will have the ability to battle the hordes of zombies plaguing the 
streets of La Jolla while getting in a 
good workout. And on top of all that, 
you will be reducing your chances of 
developing type 2 diabetes. 

By combining cutting-edge 
augmented reality (AR) technology 
with the portability of a smartphone, 
Google has the potential to make the 
entire planet its playing field. Google 
has announced its intent to release AR 
“smart glasses” that will plug into our 
smartphones by the end of the year. 

To those of you unfamiliar with 
the concept of AR, it combines both 
the virtual and the physical realities 
together. It’s like the virtual projection 
of Princess Leia in Star Wars, except 

you would be seeing the projection of 
her through your glasses. Within this 
kind of dimension, Angry Bird fans 
would have the capacity to coordinate 
a large-scale war against green pigs 
throughout the entire city. 

Personally, I’m more interested in 
battling zombies. Their plague spreads 
by devouring people’s souls and eating 
brains. I would argue that virtual 
zombies deserve to die much more 
than virtual green pigs. 

Undulating between endurance 
training and sprinting is similar to 
high intensity interval training (like 
basketball or soccer). This is different 
than just jogging at the same pace 
for thirty minutes. If you incorporate 
sprints and calisthenics into your 
endurance regimen, you’re going to 
utilize more glucose, especially at high 
intensities. Not only will this help you 
stay in shape, it will help to alleviate 
the repercussions of insulin resistance, 
the major hallmark of type 2 diabetes. 

Science and health industries 
have been trying to develop virtual 
reality (VR) based exercise for almost 
a decade. In March of 2011, the 
National Institute of Health and the 
Department of Defense co-sponsored 
a symposium in the Journal of 
Diabetes Science and Technology 
(v.5(2)) completely dedicated to 
developing VR technologies for 
obesity and diabetes. Mark Bolas 
(UCSD Alumnus) and Skip Rizzo, 
both at the Institute of Creative 
Technology at USC, reported that 
the current VR technologies are 
insufficient to provide enough daily 
exercise to meet the recommended 
need for children, but that the desire 
for gamers to interact at a larger scale 
will drive the innovation of newer and 
cheaper technologies. 

Google’s technology could change 
this forever. The high mobility, ease 
of incorporation, and relatively low 
cost ($250-$600) of Google’s new 
technology gives them the potential 
to revitalize gaming for health and 
disease prevention, especially in 
children. 

Once the technology is available, 
it’s up to the artists, engineers and 
programmers to design apps directed 
towards health instead of brain eating. 
I hope to see the next great exercise 
app developed by UCSD students, and 
expect nothing less.

Berkeley’s student paper, the Daily Californian, proposed a $2-per-semester student fee that

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, APRIL 16,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 5

Newspaper Advertising Revenue has 
dropped from $54 billion in 2000 to 
$20 billion in 2011.

This is in line with the struggles 
most student newspaper have been 
facing. Though the Guardian has 
financial and structural problems are 
not the same as those of the Daily 
Cal, the Guardian has experienced 
similar revenue problems. 

As early as 2010, the Guardian 
staff considered running a 
referendum through A.S. Council 
that would have asked students 
to pay a quarterly fee to help 
support the paper. While no official 
language was presented to council, 
the referendum was a serious 
consideration that then seemed 

like a viable means of funding, 
especially as other UC papers 
have been looking into the same. 
According to the Daily Cal, student 
fee referendums proposed to help 
campus newspapers have passed 
at UC Santa Barbara and UCLA, 
though they failed at UC Riverside. 

Ultimately, we decided that the 
financial support, while helpful, 
did not address underlying 
organizational problems and 
committed to focusing on internal 
reform and a five-year advertising 
plan before bringing a referendum 
to council. 

Of course, the Daily Cal has 
taken its own steps to keep the paper 
sustainable, such as restructuring 
the sales department, incorporating 

recruitment to business positions, 
embracing an online-first mentality 
and holding alumni fundraisers. 

Campus newspapers turning 
to university funding is a growing 
nationwide trend that is unlikely to 
end any time soon. For that reason, 
newspapers like the Daily Cal and 
the Guardian may have to revisit 
student fee referendums in the future 
 — the Editor in Chief of the Daily 
Cal has already stated his intention 
to revisit the measure in a fall special 
election. 

Until then, restructuring and 
alternative forms of revenue provide 
a tentative barrier away from the red.

APPLICATION DUE APRIL 18

Guardian alumni have gone on to write for Vanity Fair, LA Weekly, LA Times, San Diego 
Union-Tribune, Newsweek, Christian Science Monitor, Gizmodo, Gawker and many more.

Dear Editor, 
Amazing the things you can do if 

you’re wealthy. If you’re a politician 
or university administrator, you can 
help run our country or university 
into bankruptcy while enriching 
yourself. You can hire friends to 
write garbage reports about UC 
‘leftism’ because it fits your agenda.

Of course the UCs are leftist,with 
administration slashing the number 
of transfer students, raising tuition 
to unobtainable levels for the poor 
and working class, and removing 
affirmative action that leveled the 
playing field for those struggling to 
get into the racist UCs. The UCs and 
the state perpetuate the problems 
of rich becoming richer and well 
educated, leaving the masses out of 
opportunity and forced into shitty 
jobs to fuel the 1 percent!

The report that the Guardian 
decided to waste space with 
fails to even define “Leftist,” i.e. 
anti-capitalist. Recent polls by 
conservative agencies have found 
that our generation, especially 
folks of color and poor folks, are 
increasingly becoming critical 
of, if not anti-capitalist, and 
our politicians and university 
administration are doing everything 
in their power to fight these trends 
from suppressing free speech and 
activism through campus stay away 
orders, barring students unjustly 
from political activities, to arresting, 
beating and pepper-spraying them.  

As Michael Parenti writes, bias 
“...moves in more or less consistent 
directions, favoring management 
over labor...and conservative 
commentators and columnists over 
progressive or radical ones.”

Read every statement from UC 
administration (and the Guardian) 

who claim to be on our side but 
carry the state’s bias that we are “out 
of money,” “K-12 teachers are paid 
too much,” “people must be patient” 
and “things are complex.”

When in reality, we have the 
money to fully fund education, but it 
comes at the expense of dismantling 
the bias that administration and the 
state push on student and workers. 
Radical and leftist are words used to 
isolate small groups. 

The vast majority of this nation 
and world, even Republican 
Californians, are what we’d call 
‘radical’ politically, wanting free, not 
fee-d public education, universal 
healthcare, an end to our illegal wars 
and think “from each according 
to their ability to each according 
to their needs” is in the U.S. 
Constitution.

It’s time to fight for a university 
that actually prioritizes the interests 
of students and workers, not the 
red-baiting fears of politicians 
and administration. The poor and 
middle class pay a disproportionate 
amount of our taxes compared to 
the wealthy for an education that has 
increasingly become unaffordable. 

To organize with students and 
workers who are fighting to reclaim 
our university, come to Public 
Education Coalition meetings 
Mondays at 7 p.m. at the SRC in 
Price West.

idea, but it grows into something very 
concrete.”  

The abstract idea for 2012 was for 
Sun God to be a complete festival, not 
just a concert. 

“We’ve been trying to put a greater 
emphasis on art and decor, on creat-
ing atmosphere,” Zhang said. 

After Hullabaloo, the office 
formed committees, and began to kick 
the plans for the following year’s festi-
val into high gear. This year, ASCE is 
split into six committees: Production, 
Battle of the Bands, Midway and 
Decor, Booths and Sponsorship, 
Marketing and Merchandise. 

Members of the Production team 
are in charge of all the hands-on 
aspects of Sun God. Before the con-
cert, they do everything from putting 
up banners and posters to fixing lights 
on the stages. 

“It’s easy to dismiss the Production 
committee as a sort of ‘manual-labor’ 
team,” Zhang said. “But we require 
highly detail-oriented people to run 
it.” 

There is a day-of focus to the com-
mittee, Lu added. 

“Production gets performers where 
they need to be, on time,” he said. “If 
a performer needs water, Production 
gets it for them. If a performer needs a 
different setup, Production changes it 
for them. And if anything unexpected 
happens, Production is the team to 
relay the information to everyone 
else.” 

Battle of the Bands is one of the 
newest ASCE committees. It’s respon-
sible for the eponymous competition 
that allows student performers to get 
involved with Sun God. Its emphasis 
this year has been on increasing stu-

C onsidering that its inhabitants are in charge of organizing the largest, loudest, craziest concerts on cam-
pus every year, the tone in the A.S. 
Concerts and Events (ASCE) office is 
quiet and subdued. 

Efficiency comes first at ASCE. 
Desks are covered in neat stacks of 
papers and folders, and conversations 
are held in hushed tones. The whir-
ring of the Xerox machine is frequent-
ly the loudest sound in the room. 

There are just 16 members in 
ASCE. But every year, they book, 
coordinate and manage the two larg-
est music performances on campus: 
Hullabaloo and Sun God Festival. 
Between these concerts, they are kept 
busy with countless smaller perfor-
mances at the Loft, Porter’s Pub and 
throughout the six colleges. 

The office’s head, or Associate Vice 
President, is Oliver Zhang, senior 
management science major from 
Warren College. He and the three 
festival chairs — senior Jennifer Tsai, 
junior Eric Babajanian and senior 
Henry Lu — are in charge of organiz-
ing Sun God, beginning as soon as 
A.S. Council appoints the ASCE staff 
in the spring. 

“The first thing we [did] then is 
work to secure a date for the festival,” 
Zhang said. 

After that, the staff spent most of 
the summer organizing Hullaballoo, 
a more pressing need than Sun God 
due to its November date. Regardless, 
Zhang got a head start on the biggest 
party of the year, holding “visioning” 
meetings for the festival over the sum-
mer. The visioning meetings were a 
chance for the team to focus on the 
big picture for Sun God, Lu explained. 

“The Sun God process is yearlong,” 
he said. “We start out with an abstract  See ASCE, page 10

minimal // Comedian Pauly Shore performed // 1985 Prior to 1985, a few bands would play during the day but the Sun God festival revolved mainly around games, drinking and activities during the day. In 1985, an evening concert featuring Los Lobos was added on 
top of the daytime festivities, and from then on Sun God would be known as a dedicated music festival // 1984 Sun God Festival made a splash at its re-debut in 1984, with carnival games, booths and more. It is said that the longstanding UCSD tradition of running 
through the Price Center fountains on Sun God day dates back as far as the first Sun God festival in 1984. // 1983 Constructed in France, the Sun God was shipped over to campus for installation in 1983. And every year since, it has been the star of its very own 
festival. The Sun God Festival was the brainchild of Henry Chu, ‘83, an A.S. Vice President who came up with the idea for a big spring bash after visiting UCLA’s annual “Mardi Gras” festival. But the inaugural festival was canceled due to unseasonably wet weather.

“UP IN SMOKE: THE LONG-RUN IMPACT OF 
IMPROVED COOKING STOVES IN THE PRESENCE 
OF HOUSEHOLD BEHAVIOR”- SOCIAL SCIENCES 
BUILDING (SSB), ROOM 107
Using randomized evaluation techniques, we measured 
the impact of improved cooking stoves on indoor air 
pollution, health, and fuel expenditures.  Even though 
the stoves reduced indoor air pollution and required 
less fuel in laboratory tests, we find limited impacts in 
the field: even when first receiving the stoves, 
households failed to use them regularly or 
appropriately, and use declined further over time.  
These findings underscore the need to test 
environmental and health technologies in real-world 
settings where behavior may temper impacts, and to 
test them over a long enough horizon to understand 
how this behavioral effect evolves over time.

INTRODUCING OUR
NEW SPRING LINE!

dent input in the selection process. 
“They put a voting system in place 

this year for the top acts,” Tsai said. 
“Choosing an applicant is tricky.” 

In past years, the committee chose 
Battle of the Bands winners on its 
own — with mixed success. Turnout 
for the student performers tended to 
be low. For Sun God 2012, the Battle 
of the Bands committee hoped to 
remedy this by increasing student 
involvement in the selection process. 

“We’re always learning,” Lu said. 
“And we think it’s a more appropriate 
way to make the decision anyway.” 

The Midway Stage, also a relatively 
new addition to Sun God, is managed 
by the Midway and Decor committee. 
It’s in charge of bookings for the stage, 
which in recent years have included 
big names like Cirque Bezerk and 
Axis of Awesome. 

“It’s the only non-music space at 
Sun God,” Babajanian said. “And it’s 
a pretty intimate space. They have 
a great opportunity to reach people 
directly.” 

Reaching people during the 
concert may be the domain of the 
other committees, but in the weeks 
preceding Sun God, it’s the Marketing 
Committee that reaches people most 
directly. The members are in charge 
of building hype and a sense of cam-
pus spirit through campaigns such 
as Sun God Babies, paper cut-outs of 
baby Sun Gods hidden around cam-
pus that can be redeemed for prizes. 
However, they are also in charge of 
promoting safety at the concert. 

“This year we’re looking at launch-
ing a pretty intricate student health 
campaign just before the festival,” 
Babajanian said.  

Money for all these campaigns, as 
well as artist bookings, comes partly 
from the revenue generated by the 
Booths and Sponsorship committee, 
as well as the Merchandise commit-

tee.
“Hopkins Avenue is converted 

to Sun God Street for the festival,” 
Zhang said. “It gets completely filled 
with booths.” 

Though corporate sponsors gener-
ally have a both or two, most booths 
are run by food vendors or student 
orgs. As with the other companies, 
Booths and Sponsorship has a great 
deal of freedom. 

“D’Lush, a drinks company, was 
one of our big sponsors last year,” 
Zhang said. “We had been wanting a 
lounge for some time, and they want-
ed to get their product out to UCSD 
students. Booths and Sponsorship 
worked with them to create a long-
type space at Sun God to meet both 
of our needs.” 

The merchandise committee 
most closely resembles a focus group. 
Committee members work with 
Triton Outfitters and the A.S. Graphic 
Design Studio to analyze trends and 
select the best designs for Sun God 
merchandise. 

As the concert date approaches, 
ASCE’s focus shifts to booking. The 
most important thing in selecting 
performers is student preference. 

“We ask them on our Facebook 
page, we ask them at the Sun God 
open forums,” Zhang said. “We make 
a list of which artists students want 
to see, and start gathering agent con-
tacts.” 

Fortunately, many agents have 
worked with Sun God in the past. 

“That simplifies things,” 
Babajanian said. “But just because we 
reach out to an agent doesn’t mean 
an artist will want to come here at a 
college show. Even if they do want to 
come, their price range may not fit 
out budget.” 

 Rising stars are better than 
established hits because they tend 
to be cheaper. But obscure picks are 
unlikely to draw big crowds. 

“We have to do the best with the 

$550,000 we’re allocated by A.S., and 
what revenue we make from the 3,000 
non-student tickets we sell every 
year.” 

Budgets and student input aren’t 
the only factors ASCE takes into 
account. 

“We want someone who can do 
good live performances — someone 
who can hold students’ attention,” Lu 
said. Selecting artists for Sun God is 
a delicate art, but Lu has experience, 
having booked for Warren Live for 
three years. 

“The biggest challenge for me this 
year was finding a lineup sequence 
that would flow,” Lu said. “You can’t 
go from Mastodon to Bon Iver. You 
have to ask yourself, ‘Is the crowd that 
came for the last performance going 
to stick around for this one?’” 

One thing the team says it never 
considers is its members’ personal 
music preferences. 

“It’s our number one rule here: 
Throw your personal preferences out 
the window,” Zhang said. “We’re try-
ing to represent 20,000 students here. 
Of course it’s impossible to do that. 
But at the end of the day, we want to 
be able to say that we got as close as 
we could.” 

The Sun God lineup would look 
very different otherwise.

“If it were really up to our pref-
erences, Eric would be booking all 
metal shows,” Lu said. 

The process of booking artists 
can take anywhere from an hour to a 
month. It can be easy or exhausting. 
Frequently, it doesn’t pan out. But 
plenty of planning and an early start 
have ensured that this year’s lineup 
for Sun God won’t disappoint. 

But for all the work they have put 
in, the committee likes to let the art-
ists take the spotlight. 

“We like to stay invisible,” Lu said. 
“When the concert comes around, 
and students are having a good time 
— that’s enough of a reward for us.” 

▶ ASCE, from page 6

ASCE Doesn’t Consider Personal Preferences

Expenses can continue to fluctu-
ate leading up to the festival and 
throughout the day of the show, but 
Zhang estimated that $200,000 will 
be spent on talent, $63,000 on facility 
expenses, $355,000 on production 
expenses, $115,000 on health and 
safety expenses and $6,500 on mar-
keting expenses.

The D’lush lounge, which debuted 
last year to serve mixed drinks and 
provide couches for students to relax 
and watch the concert streaming live, 
will return this year, and there will be 
a greater emphasis on art around the 
festival grounds.

“In past years, we’ve always had 
a part of the festival dedicated to art 
work,” festival coordinator Henry Lu 
said. “This year we found that it’s 
kind of a forgotten part of the festival, 
so we’re taking a new approach to 
how we handle art…and that ended 
up becoming an art and décor com-
mittee these past two quarters.” 

Lu revealed that one of the results 
of this committee is the inclusion of 
performance art in the form of giant, 
light-up jellyfish.

“We call it a music and arts festi-
val, but the art part has been kind of 
downplayed in past years and this is 
our first year, our first initial step in 
that direction,” Zhang said.

As part of the “Sun God For a 
Cause” initiative, A.S. Council will 
work with 94.9’s It’s About the Music 
Foundation to sell a special T-shirt to 
raise money for music education.

ASCE publicly announced the 
lineup on their website on Monday.

collegiate baseball realm, as O’Brien 
accepted a head coaching position at 
Santa Clara University last season. In 
his first season with the Division-I 
Broncos, O’Brien has amassed a 18–12 
record, with conference series against 
USF, UOP and BYU remaining, 
O’Brien already has a better record 
than his predecessor, who went 16–34 
overall and 4–17 in the West Coast 
Conference. 

Preceding O’Brien was Triton 
volleyball coach Tom Black. Black a 
former gold-medalist who graduated 
from UCSD in 1996. 

Black currently serves as a 
consultant coach for the U.S. Olympic 
men’s volleyball team, before which 
he accepted a coaching position at 
Loyola Marymount. Black guided the 
2010 Lion roster to a 15–15 record, 
and a fourth-place finish in the West 
Coast Conference. 

Elliott will follow Black to Loyola, 
where she will have her work cut out 
for her.  

The bottom of the conference 
Lions went 8–22 overall last 
season and 3–13 in the West Coast 
Conference. 

However, Elliott has a proven 
track record of turning teams around. 
Back in 2005, Elliott led Division-I 
Portland State to its first Big Sky 
conference tournament in its previous 
three years.

But until UCSD is acknowledged 
by the Big West, UCSD will continue 
to serve as a stepping stone for under-
appreciated collegiate coaches. 

 

The Tritons regrouped in the 
second set, recording a tremendous 
14 of 17 on sideout attempts, while 
also tallying 11 kills on just two 
errors. UCSD took the set 15-25.  
      “In the second game we had 
fewer errors from the serves, we 
passed really well, we had good 
sideout efficiency,” Ring said. 
       The Lancers took back the lead 
in the third set, overcoming an early 
Triton lead to win 25-23. 

“We had an early lead, and that 
evaporated,” Ring said. “It was a 
disappointing game three, to be up in 
the driver’s seat and then watch them 
take over.”

UCSD took the fourth set 21-25 
to push for overtime, with the help 
of sophomore setter Mike Brunsting. 
Brunsting, who was the setter of 
choice for Ring early in the season, 
has seen his minutes drop over the 

course of the past few games. But 
against the Lancers, Brunsting came 
off the bench to record five big assists 
in the fourth game. 

The Tritons took control in the 
fifth set, as UCSD was perfect on its 
side of the net, recording 12 kills on 
no errors.

Junior outside hitter Carl 
Eberts led the Tritons in the attack 
with 19 kills on five errors, while 
redshirt freshman Cheyne Hayes 
chipped in 13 kills to go along with 
sophomore Sebastian Brady’s 11 kills. 
    “It’s nice to win again, we had a real 
nice win streak going in the MPSF,” 
Ring said. “Then we faced a couple 
pretty good teams on the road. We lost 
two at [USC] and [Pepperdine], but 
it’s good just to get back to winning.” 
       Without hope of a postseason, 
the Tritons were swept by No. 2 UC 
Irvine in their last game of the season. 

The Anteaters downed the 

Tritons in dominant fashion, with 
scores of 25-19, 25-16 and 25-20. 
    “[Irvine’s] coming in and they still 
had something to fight for tonight,” 
Ring said. “They’re heading into the 
playoffs next week, and they wanted 
to end the season on a high note.” 
    The Anteaters’ Kevin Tillie, a 
French international, led the field 
with 13 kills and three blocks. 
    Eberts had another strong game for 
the Tritons, but collectively, UCSD 
seemed flat in the attack, tallying just 
27 kills to the Anteaters’ 43. 

“I’m definitely proud of 
the improvements we’ve made 
throughout the season. 

We had an early win against 
[BYU-Hawaii] on the road, and then 
kind of went through a tough patch 
there to be able to kind of keep our 
heads up, keep working in practice. 

I don’t think we ever get down 
on ourselves. I felt like we had some 

competitive matches. You can see 
signs that we’re getting better, we’re 
keeping ourselves in it.”

Despite tallying 6-16 MPSF 
conference record, the Tritons seem 
poised on improvement in 2013.

Without a senior on their roster, 
the Tritons will return next season 
with their entire roster intact, a group 
including last week’s AVCA National 
Player of the week sophomore Vaun 
Lennon, sophomore middle-blocker 
Sebastian Brady and junior outside 
hitter Carl Eberts.  

“This is a tie for our second most 
wins in conference, at six,” Ring said. 
“So in some ways this could have 
been a rebuilding year, we lost some 
key guys, some seniors last year, new 
guys have stepped in and they’ve 
showed they can play.”

Tritons End 2012 Campaign With 9-19 Record

Saturday, April 7 by CSU Los Angeles, 
winning two out of their nine games. 

The No. 3 doubles team of Mulloy 
and Wilke won their match 8-5. 

UCSD’s No. 1 doubles team of 
Breisacher and Davis were defeated 
8–4. 

No. 2 doubles team Chu and 
Vanooteghem played a close game, 
9-8. 

No. 6 singles, Davis defeated 
Franco in straight sets, 6–1, 6–0. 

Breisacher lost the No. 1 singles 
match 6–3, 6–4. Chu lost the No. 
2 singles match 6–3, 6–4 , while 
Vanooteghem lost the No. 3 singles 
match 6–3, 6–4.

Senior Samantha Yeung lost the 
No. 4 singles match in straight sets, 

6–0, 6–1 to Jill Sangria. 
Mizuguchi fought hard against 

Leung in the No. 5 singles match, 
losing the first set, but coming back 
in the second set. She lost in the 
tiebreaker, 6–0, 6–7, 10–4.  

The Tritons drop to 6–12 this 
season, dropping their last five games. 
UCSD will play against the Warriors 
again on Friday, April 20. 

“We had tough match today 
[April 15] against a really tough team 
[Abilene Christian] and then we have 
a match tomorrow [April 16], so we’re 
hoping that we’ll gain confidence from 
these matches to get us better prepared 
for that match,” LaPlante said.

Tennis Falls to Stanislaus
On the men’s side, freshman Keith 

Rose salvaged an otherwise lackluster 
day for the men, recording a 10.86s 
time in the 100m, good enough to 
move him up from fifth to fourth 
all-time.

“I really wanted to win my heat 
and get an orange t-shirt,” Keith said. 
“But I really want that school record 
[in the 100m dash]. I’ll only be happy 
when something three-tenths of a 
second quicker scrolls across that 
screen.”

Junior Aletha Vassilakis hit a new 
personal best in the Javelin throw of 
124’3”, good enough for No. 10 on the 
UCSD all-time list.

In the Paralympic component, 
Jeremy Campbell, who has no lower 

left leg and uses a special prosthetic, 
threw a new American Record at 
190’7”. 

The mark was good for third 
overall in not just the Paralympic, 
but also the overall competition. 
The mark would be good enough to 
make the Olympic Trials in the non-
paralympic games.

Blake Leeper, a blind athlete, ran 
in the 200m dash along with his 
seeing compatriot  time of 22.43s was 
good enough for 21st overall in a field 
of over 80 seeing athletes.

The Tritons will head to the Soka 
Peace Invitational this weekend, April 
20-21.

BLOCKED OUT :
BY RACHEL UDA
Sports Editor

The UCSD Men’s Volleyball team ended the 2012 season with a 3-0 loss 
at home to No. 2 UC Irvine. 
       The No. 12 Tritons were knocked 
out of contention for the Mountain 
Pacific Sports Federation conference 
playoff last Friday night, April 13, 
when No. 11 Cal State Northridge 
defeated No. 6 Pepperdine. Despite 
the Tritons’ five-set victory 
over Cal Baptist, UCSD could 

not overtake Northridge in the 
standings to clinch the eighth seed.  
       On Friday, UCSD got off to a 
sluggish opening set, falling 20-25 to 
the Lancers. 

The Tritons logged a sloppy 13 
kills on nine errors, compared to 
Cal Baptist’s 11 kills on four errors.  
       “We really talked about the serve 
and receive battle, we really wanted to 
serve better than they served, and we 
wanted to pass better,” UCSD head 
coach Kevin Ring said. “And I don’t 
think we did that in the first game.”

WOMEN’S TENNIS — Women’s 
tennis get served in season’s end

On Wednesday, April 11, the 
No. 21 Tritons faced No. 33 CSU 
Stanislaus. 

The Tritons only won three games: 
one doubles match and two singles, 
falling 6–3 to the Warriors. 

“I think we played really well,” 
head coach Liz LaPlante said. “[CSU 
Stanislaus] were a tough team and 
there were strong players in the top of 
their lineup.”

The No. 3 doubles team of senior 
Katie Mulloy and sophomore Laura 
Wilke defeated Stanislaus’ Heather 
Cotter and McKenzy Harden 8–2. 

No. 1 doubles team of junior Melissa 
Breisacher and junior Jacquelyn Davis 

suffered a loss to undefeated doubles 
team Verena Preikschas and Katie 
Eng, 8–5. 

Freshman Melinda Chu and 
Sophomore Tara Vanooteghem 
suffered a disappointing 8-1 loss.

Mulloy won the No. 4 singles 
match against Chrisco in straight sets, 
6–3, 6–0. Davis won her match as well, 
6–2, 6–2 in the No. 6 singles.

No. 1 singles Breisacher suffered a 
thorough loss to Preikschas 6–1, 6–1. 

Krystal Mizugushi put up a fight 
against Harden in the No. 5 singles, 
losing in a tiebreaker, 7–6, 5–7, 10–8. 
Vanooteghem also worked hard 
against Eng in the No. 3 singles match. 
She was defeated 6–4, 7–6. 

Chu lost her No. 2 singles match 
6–4, 6–2 against Meza.

UCSD Tennis Drop 
Fifth Straight Match

In the wake of a failed Division-I referendum, UCSD supporters and athletes may find themselves 
in the limbo that is Division II for 
years to come. 

Division I and the Big West may 
be a pipe dream for us, but there is 
one demographic for which there is 
no glass ceiling: UCSD coaches. More 
specifically, successful UCSD coaches. 

With the announcement of 
three-time conference coach of the 
year Charity Elliot’s departure for 
Division-I Loyola Marymount, just 
weeks after putting together the 
winning season in program history, I 
couldn’t help but be reminded of 2011 
head baseball coach Dan O’Brien. 

O’Brien has sat at the helm of 
Triton baseball for the previous 14 
years. In his last two seasons as head 
coach, O’Brien led the Tritons to 
two regular season titles, where the 
Tritons made their program debut at 
the NCAA Division II World Series. 

His success at the national level 
obviously caught the attention of the 

DII UCSD: 
A Stepping 
Stone for 
CoachesBY NICK HOWEAssociate Sports Editor

TRACK & FIELD — Saturday, 
April 14 the Triton Track and Field 
team traveled to Pomona where it 
competed in the annual Pomona-
Pitzer Invitational. 

The Tritons had several break-
out performances that day, with 
senior Jackie Rose again leading the 
way as she set a personal best time, 
24.52 seconds. The mark is good 
for an NCAA provisional mark in 
the 200m dash to go along with her 
400m automatic mark, good enough 
for sixth place. UCSD alumnus Kelly 
Fogarty won the overall event in the 
200m, who recorded a 24.02 seconds 
to beat out elite athlete Adrienne 
Power, who ran a 24.03 second time.

UCSD freshman Sabrina Pimentel 
also had a stellar day on the track, 

running a personal best of 2:12.96s 
in the 800m, half a second faster than 
her previous best and good enough 
for first in her heat and second overall. 
The freshman went on to run a strong 
57-second split in her 400m leg. The 
anchor leg for the Triton “A” team for 
the day was senior Deyna Roberson, 
who split a 56 second lap on her 400m 
run to give the women second overall 
in the event.

“It was really great to be able to 
lead on the 200m, so that I was able to 
open up my sprint more,” Rose said. 
“And it feels good to feel the speed I 
needed in the 400m while running 
the 200m.”

Roberson shone with a new season 
best in the 400m hurdles as well, 
posting a 1:02.18 that provisionally 
qualifies her for NCAA Division II 
Nationals.
