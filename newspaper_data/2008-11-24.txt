UCSD Ranked Among Nation’s Top Surfing Schools

By Joyce Yeh
Staff Writer

The UC Board of Regents 
approved its 2009-10 budget pro-
posal Nov. 20, requesting an increase 
of $755 million in funding from the 
state Legislature, including a $110 
million sum to accommodate rising 
enrollment and avoid a previously 
considered 9.4 percent increase in 
undergraduate fees for the next aca-
demic year. 

The request for extra funding 
follows the regents’ original Nov. 19 
proposal, which would have required 
an increase in tuition of at least $662 
per year for in-state undergraduates, 
as well as new freshman enrollment 
limits.

The regents said they were reluc-
tant to restrict admission for quali-
fied students, but conceded that

Berkeley Protesters Sentenced After Two Years in Tree
By Sarah de Crescenzo
Senior Staff Writer

Three of nine protestors involved 
in a two-year tree-sitting demonstra-
tion — in response to the proposed 
construction of a $125 million train-
ing facility for student athletes at UC 
Berkeley — have been sentenced to 
five days in jail, and are being held 
responsible by the university for thou-
sands of dollars in legal fees. 

The protest, which ended Sept. 9 
after 22 months of conflict between the 
tree-sitters and university police, aimed 
to halt the razing of an oak grove to 
allow for construction of the four-story 
Student Athlete High Performance 
Center, which will be used by UC 
Berkeley’s 27 varsity sports teams.

The six remaining protesters agreed 
to a deal with the university, pleading 

CAMPUS PROFS CHOSEN FOR OBAMA TRANSITION TEAM

By Henry Becker
Staff Writer

Two UCSD faculty members 
have been named co-leaders of 
President-elect Barack Obama’s 
transition team, which will help 

form early policy and provide sup-
port and direction for the formation 
of January’s new administration. 

Peter Cowhey, dean of the UCSD 
School of International Relations 
and Pacific Studies, was tapped to 
co-lead the transition team working 
on trade policy, while UCSD chem-
istry and biochemistry professor 
Mario Molina was slated to co-lead 
the transition team charged with 
developing the new administration’s 
policy related to science and tech-
nology.

In addition to forming policy, 
Cowhey’s team evaluates positions 
for U.S. Representative Transition, a 
Cabinet-level agency. 

For the length of his transition-
team membership, Cowhey will 
commute between Washington and 
San Diego in order to continue his 
duties as dean, UCSD spokeman 
Barry Jagoda said.

“This assignment will have no 
impact on Dean Cowhey’s role at 
[International Relations and Pacific 
Studies] as dean and as associate 

vice chancellor for international 
affairs at UCSD, except to highlight 
the high quality of leadership at UC 
San Diego,” Jagoda said.

Cowhey’s book, to be published 
next year, focuses on international 
trade and the use of technology 
to create trade opportunities. He 
declined to comment, under instruc-
tion from the transition team.

Molina is a Nobel laureate in 
chemistry for his work in the iden-

UNIVERSITY 
TO ADDRESS 
LIBRARIAN 
DEMANDS

By Deepak Seeni
Staff Writer

At a meeting last week, the 
American Federation of Teachers 
on behalf of UC librarians agreed 
to continue salary negotiations next 
month, when university negotiators 
are expected to respond to demands 
for higher librarian salaries.

“Several points were made on 
Wednesday,” chief negotiator for UC 
librarians Mike Rotkin said. “We 
have demonstrated extensively to 
the administration that University of 
California librarians are tens of thou-
sands of dollars behinds their CSU, 
CC and public library counterparts in 
terms of salaries.”

Rotkin said that while the univer-
sity continues to experience budget 
cuts due to the state’s deficit, the 
university sits on approximately $6 
billion in unrestricted assets that 
could be used to pay UC librarians 
a total of $5 million in annual salary 
increases. 

“It’s not a matter of if we have 
the money or not,” Rotkin said. “It’s 
a matter of priorities. The univer-
sity has already allocated salary 
increases for university police, legal

An increase in law-journal arti-
cles this year challenging the legal-
ity of legacy admissions indicates 
that the issue may soon be taken 
to court. 

Legacy admission — the prac-
tice of granting special preference 
to children of alumni when consid-
ering candidates for admittance 
— is a tradition long practiced by 
both public and private schools 
nationwide.

Those practicing legacy admis-
sion defend the system as a way 
of showing appreciation for alumni 
support, financial and otherwise; 
however, critics condemn it as 
giving advantage to those who 
already have considerable advan-
tage over other candidates. 

Instead of disputing the fairness 
of legacy admission, the increased 
journalistic attention evaluates 
such practices on a legal basis.

A recent article published by 
a group of lawyers in the Santa 
Clara Review argued that the over-

arching premise of the 1866 Civil 
Rights Act was equal rights for 
all citizens, and that these rights 
should not be based on heredity. 
The article advocates a ban on 
legacy admissions in public and 
private universities. 

“I’m going to do whatever I can 
to make these things go away,” 
said lawyer Steven D. Shadowen, 
lead author of the article.

A similar article — by Carlton 
F.W. Larson, a professor at UC 
Davis School of Law — was pub-
lished early this November in 
the Washington University Law 
Review. 

Carson argued that the nobility 
clause of the Constitution, which 
bans titles such as “earl” and 
“duke” in federal or state gov-
ernment, in fact advises against 
the use of all hereditary privilege 
in public institutions. If Carson’s 
argument holds up in court, it 
would ban legacy admissions at 
only public schools.

The authors of both articles are 
currently seeking plantiffs to chal-
lenge the legality of legacy admis-
sions in court. 

A team of international research-
ers has developed “waterproof” 
versions of popular species of rice,  
able to produce high yields even 
after being submerged in water for 
up to two weeks.

The new strains are on the verge 
of receiving official approval for  
release by governments in India 
and Bangladesh, where annual 
floods destroy enough rice to feed 
up to 30 million people. 

The international research 
team included participants from 
UC Riverside, UC Davis and the 
International Rice Research Institute 
in the Philippines. 

Julia Bailey-Serres, a genetics 
professor at UC Riverside, is cur-
rently leading research to explain 
exactly how gene Sub1A works to 
make rice varieties flood-tolerant 
by studying how plants with and 
without the gene respond to sub-
mergence in water. 

“Sub1A effectively makes the 
plant dormant during submergence, 

allowing it to conserve energy until 
the floodwaters recede,” Bailey-
Serres said. 

The findings were published in 
the Oct. 20 issue of Proceedings of 
the Natural Academy of Sciences, 
USA. 

“The potential for impact 
is huge,” said Dave Mackillt, 
senior rice breeder at the IRRI. 
“In Bangladesh, for example, 20 
percent of the rice land is flood 
prone and the country typically 
suffers several major floods each 
year. Submergence-tolerant variet-
ies could make major inroads into 
Bangladesh’s annual rice shortfall 
and substantially reduce its import 
needs.”

Developed through precision 
breeding, the plants are condi-
tioned to avoid much of the regula-
tory testing that can typically delay 
the release of genetically modified 
crops. 

Researchers are hoping that 
the new flood-tolerant strains of 
rice, which have passed experi-
mental tests in farmer’s fields, will 
be made available to smallholding 
farms within the next two years.

with continuing state budget cuts 
the university cannot sustain any 
further student enrollment. The 
university currently enrolls 10,000 
more students than can be sup-
ported by state funding, at a cost 
of $120 million from internal fund-
ing sources. In addition, the state’s 
per-student spending has fallen 
nearly 40 percent since 1990, from 
$15,860 to $9,560 currently, taking 
into account inflation and enroll-
ment growth.

“No one wants to curtail the 
opportunity [for admission], but 
how do we keep absorbing 5,000 
more possible students when no one 
is giving us the money to pay for 
them?” UC President Mark G. Yudof 
asked in his address to the regents at 
last week’s meeting.

Regent and Lt. Gov. John 
Garamendi said the decision to put 
the pressure of increasing student 
fees onto the state was a “tactical 
issue,” because simply accepting fee 
increases would mean prematurely 
surrendering, prior to the state-bud-
get debates in January.

According to UC spokesman 

Ricardo Vazquez, the regents pre-
sented their budget proposal early to 
announce the university’s intentions 
to work with the state to reach a 
budget agreement.

“The reason we’re asking the 
state for the money that we’re ask-
ing is that we recognize the state’s 
significant budget difficulties and 
we intend to work with the elected 
officials,” Vazquez said. “It’s impor-
tant at the beginning of the budget 
process for the university to lay out 
a plan. As [President Yudof] said, 
what we wanted to do was forcefully 
articulate what it takes to keep the 
University of California great.”

Currently, the university faces a 
possible $65.5 million midyear state 
funding cut, on top of the already-
implemented $48 million cut. As a 
result, the university would be left 
to fund the $100 million in expenses 
demanded by enrollment growth 
and inflation. Chancellors from vari-
ous campuses have reported delayed 
and reduced academic programs, 
limited student services, reduced 
course selection and decreased fac-
ulty recruitment. 

“The situation we face is serious, 

and some very tough choices are 
ahead of us,” Yudof said. “We need to 
preserve access and affordability to 
the greatest extent possible. We also 
need to ensure that we’re providing 
students access to an education of 
the high quality they expect of UC. 
And we can’t leave the state with the 
impression that we continue doing 
more and more with fewer and fewer 
resources.” 

The budget proposal also accounts 
for next year’s enrollment growth, 
core academic needs, compensation 
for faculty and staff, resumed contri-
butions to the UC Retirement Plan 
and various recommended initia-
tives in graduate student support 
and research.

If the Legislature refuses the regents’ 
request for extra funding, or if the state 
continues to cut from higher educa-
tion, the university will likely increase 
student fees by at least 9.4 percent 
beginning next academic year.

The regents are expected to 
finalize 2009-10 student tuition in 
March.

County and Municipal Employees], 
so why not us?” 

Rotkin said the union’s request 
to raise UC librarian salaries to the 
same level as those at respective CSU 
institutions still stands, and that a 
university response is expected to 
be presented at the next meeting 
between the two parties, scheduled 
for Dec. 10. 

According to Rotkin, the univer-
sity has consistently neglected to per-

form exit interviews with outgoing 
librarians over the past decade, leav-
ing the university unaware of growing 
problems in recruitment and reten-
tion that have resulted from inequi-
table salaries between UC librarians 
and their counterparts at other edu-
cational institutions. 

“The trouble we are currently 
experiencing in filling librarian posi-
tions among university campuses is 
due to increased awareness by librar-
ians that the UC system is no longer 
paying as well as the CSU system or 
many community colleges,” said Ken 

Ryans, a librarian at UC Santa Cruz. 
“I have seen colleagues leave posi-
tions at the University of California 
to take up positions offered at local 
state universities and community col-
leges because they pay significantly 
better.”

Representatives from the UC 
Office of the President declined to 
comment, and UCSD officials did 
not respond to several requests for a 
statement.

tification of chlorofluorocarbon-gas impact in

Molina said his role on the team will be to 
interview applicants for positions in the new 
administration and suggest scientific policy 
for the upcoming term.

“We’re preparing to set the stage so that 
the new administration takes office on Jan. 
20 with very important changes,” Molina said, 
highlighting the roles of science and technol-
ogy.

Molina said that the new science adviser 
he will help select will occupy a near Cabinet-
level post set to begin work within the first 
days of the new administration.

“I remember with the Bush administration 
it was a half a year, almost a year before a sci-
ence adviser was chosen and it wasn’t a very 
important position, so that’s why we want to 
change that,” Molina said. “It was downgraded 
and reduced in size so we want to prepare 
things so this is restored.”

Molina said Obama’s administration will 
seek to create a nonpartisan atmosphere in 
which scientists can conduct research free of 
political influence. 

“Some of Obama’s goals are connected 
with the integrity of science — that the sci-
entific community should be able to express 
their opinion even through reports within 
the government without being sanctioned or 
modified just for political ideology,” he said. 

Molina said he expects the Obama admin-
istration to devote more time and resources 
to a number of science- and technology-relat-
ed issues given low priority during the last 

two terms, including the concern of climate 
change.

“Early on with the Bush administration, 
the problem itself wasn’t even recognized 
so that was just speculation,” Molina said. 
“The evidence became very clear, so the Bush 
administration accepted the problem but took 
very small steps. We expect to be able to 
set the stage to prepare things so there is a 
consensus within the academic world, so the 
new administration can be more proactive 
and participate in measures within the United 
States.”

Molina also mentioned possible shifts in 
policy regarding stem-cell research and efforts 
to help draw a greater influx of science-orient-
ed students to the United States than observed 
during the Bush administration.

Molina emphasized that his work for the 
transition team is voluntary and should not 
influence his duties at UCSD, and that his 
purely advisory position will not involve the 
finalization of policy. 

Chancellor Marye Anne Fox praised the 
two faculty members for their contribution to 
the country. 

“These two multifaceted scholars represent 
the exceptional and deep reservoir of talent 
among our ranks at UC San Diego,” Fox said 
in a statement. “This is a good sign from the 
new administration to be reaching beyond 
the Washington infrastructure to call upon 
the experience, talent and wisdom of Peter 
Cowhey and Mario Molina.”

guilty to violating an October 2007 stay-away 
court order by remaining in the trees or assisting 
those who remained. The court ruled at that date 
that the tree-sitters were illegally occupying uni-
versity property, and denied their assertions that 
the protest was a legal form of free speech. 

In exchange for their surrender, protesters 
who accepted the deal received a lightened sen-
tence of 50 hours of community service, and the 
university agreed not to seek attorney’s fees.

“We have been working with them from 
the beginning,” university legal counsel Michael 
Goldstein said. “We told them what they were 
doing was illegal, we asked the judge to decide, 
and he agreed it was illegal. This ruling is just 
further confirmation of what we have said all 
along — they have no right to be up in those 
trees.”

Carol Strickman, a Bay Area attorney with the 
defense, said she opposes the university’s decision 
to seek reparations from the three protesters who 
did not accept the plea bargain.

“I think that the university is taking a hard-
line stance, for whatever reason, and it’s a little 
too much across the board,” Strickman said. “The 
grove is down and everyone is heartbroken about 
that. People put a tremendous amount of their 
money and time and effort into this protest.”

As a result of the tree-sit, the university spent 
over $1.5 million on security personnel, police 
resources and fences and scaffolding to surround 
the oak trees occupied by demonstrators.

“The university has used everything from 
violence and deception against the tree-sitters,” 
Strickman said. 

She cited an October incident in which a 

private letter written by UC Berkeley Chancellor 
Robert Birgeneau became public. The letter 
described the opposition to the new training 
facility as “racism against our underrepresented 
student athletes.”

“We were in awe of the magnitude of the 
deception of that statement,” Strickman said. 

UC Berkeley spokesman Dan Mogulof said 
the chancellor’s letter was referring to opposition 
to the proposed training facility in general, not 
the tree-sitters’ actions in particular.

Though opposition to the proposed construc-
tion was not limited to that of the tree-sitters 
— as evidenced by the magnitude of the ground 
support in assisting the protesters throughout 
the demonstration — some Berkeley students 
disagreed with the protesters’ methods.

“Regardless of how you feel about the rebuild-
ing of Memorial Stadium — and I’m personally 
very skeptical of the project given its enormous 
cost — many students, including myself, were 
frustrated with the tree-sitters,” UC Berkeley 
senior Robert Klein said. “The sit-in was above 
grandstanding by a small group of people that 
cost the university a great deal of time and 
money. Most Berkeley students understand that 
civil disobedience is an important tool when our 
government fails to work as it should. But in this 
case, even if you disagree with the outcome, due 
process worked quite well and the sit-in was just 
an unnecessary debacle.”

The trees in the construction area have since 
been cut down and construction of the new 
sports training center is expected to begin soon.

I’m not going to lie: I’m a Disney kid. When we were young my little brother and I loved “Peter 
Pan.” We had sing-along tapes to 
what I now realize is definitely a 
politically incorrect song about 
Native Americans, we’d play fol-
low the leader like it was actually 
an interesting game and when my 
brother got mad at someone he’d call 
them a codfish — the three-year-
old equivalent of a really, really bad 
word. Accordingly, Pirates of the 
Caribbean was our favorite theme-
park ride (splash potential and fake 
fire make it way more epic than 
the storybook-style Peter Pan one) 
even though that talking skull and 
crossbones at the beginning was 
fucking scary. 

So when pirates of the real-life 
variety starting making headlines 
recently, it pretty much rocked my 
world. Did pot-bellied, striped-shirt-
wearing swashbucklers actually exist 
far out in the deep blue? Is there a 
dingy tavern somewhere filled with 
patch-eyed hearties pounding rum 
from chest-stolen goblets accom-
panied only by their parrot mates? 
Are gold doubloons still an accepted 
form of currency and if so where can 
I get some?!

Obviously I was more than a little 
disheartened to read that these mod-
ern-day pirates have next to nothing 
in common with Mr. Smee. As it 
turns out, most 21st century pirates 
aren’t even peg legged; they’re actu-
ally quite spry. They also don’t occu-
py the same magical lagoons that 
mermaids frequent, carry out duels 
by bejeweled-sword point or rely on 
dog-eared scrolls to tell them where 
the treasure lies. 

No, the bandits roaming today’s 
high seas are much more advanced. 
These heavily armed groups use GPS 
tracking systems, attack trade ships 
for multimillion-dollar ransoms and 
even have their own spokespeople 
to talk with the press via satellite 
cell phones. (Major props for that 
last thing by the way — competent 
spokespeople are hard to find, UCSD 
certainly lacks them.)

I was pretty sad to discover that 
the pirates of childhood lore are no 
more real than the sea monsters they 
were sometimes concerned with. But 
as I read more about these Somali 
brigands, I realized they still deserve 
recognition. Sure, they’re storming 
ships without cause, holding inno-
cent people hostage and demand-
ing gratuitous sums, but that doesn’t 
mean they aren’t ballsy mofos.

Originally driven by an urge 
to protect their local waters from 
illegal fishing and dumping, these 
pirates now use the exorbitant ran-
soms they charge to pump money 
back into their desperately poor 
homes. (Recognizing that weapons 
have brought a history of hurt to 
their native Somalia, they’re strictly 
in it for the money, pirate spokes-
man Sugule Ali told the New York 
Times in late September.) Now that

Leak in the System

By Matthew McArdle
Senior Staff Writer

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA — As 
the nation’s premier public institution 
of higher learning, the 10-campus 
University of California system has 
long strived to preserve high-quality 
education by facilitating long-term 
commitments to its students and 
the people of California to maintain 
accessibility and affordability.

At least, that’s what the UC 
Board of Regents claims. Faced 
with an unfathomable state deficit 
(just try to comprehend $28 bil-
lion — it’s difficult), the regents 
decided at their monthly meeting 
last week in San Francisco to omit 
student-fee increases from the 2009-
10 budget despite signs from the 
state Legislature and Gov. Arnold 

Schwarzenegger that the university 
should expect less state-provided 
money in next year’s coffer.

Lt. Gov. John Garamendi, an ex-
officio regent who led the push to 
strike $215 million in increases that 
the board later approved, said this 
year’s plan was the first in recent 
memory that the board sent the bud-
get forward without a call for student-
fee increases. Moreover, Garamendi 
— flanked by UC President Mark G. 
Yudof and several other high-profile 
regents — claimed the move would 
send a message to the Legislature that 
the university was serious about its 
mission to keep student fees as low 
as possible.

Although some might be 
scratching their heads at the pro-
posal, wondering how the university 
will stay on its feet if it doesn’t do 

something to combat the funding 
shortfall, the fact remains that the 
regents will increase student fees. 
There’s simply no way that the state 
will agree to fund the university 
both its entire $3.809 billion bud-
get proposal and provide money to 
stave off fee increases, especially 
considering that state support has 
been on a downward trend for years 
— dropping nearly 40 percent per 
student since 1990 when adjusted 
for inflation and enrollment growth. 
Outspoken Regent Judith Hopkinson 
was bluntly realistic in her predic-
tion for next year’s budget, saying 
at the meeting that there was not a 
“snowball’s chance” the university’s 
request would be honored.

So why did the regents do it? 
Obviously, they just wanted to 
shift more pronounced blame for 

the inevitable increase to lawmak-
ers, who after having no choice 
but to decline the university’s pro-
posal would suddenly find fingers 
pointing at them from all direc-
tions — students, administrators, 
parents, higher-education interest 
groups — and leave the beleaguered 
regents, who will tactfully play the 
victim card, with no choice but to 
enact the estimated 9.4 percent fee 
increase anyway.

Although their move was almost 
purely symbolic, the regents have 
succeeded in drawing attention to 
the drowning state higher-education 
system, offering a tough stance in 
the face of lawmakers who have let 
affordability slip under the radar in 
recent years (undergraduate tuition

LOCAL NEWS — In the pay-no-mind 
tradition of flipping a light switch, crank-
ing the air conditioning or chucking our 
messy fast-food remains in the magically 
self-emptying trash bin five times a day, the 
American consumption of water is awarded 
about as much calculation as breathing 
in and out. Gallons are leaking all around 
us, in our every moment of privilege and 
neglect — in elaborate lawns and non-
native gardens, in over-efficient washing 
machines and dishwashers, in that awful 
three minutes of tooth brushing between 
wetting and spitting all too often scored by 
the waterfall of a forgotten high-pressure 
faucet. 

But unlike good ol’ oxygen, which will 
likely stick around a while longer, water 
(on a whim, wherever we want it) is all 
but drying up in front of unseeing eyes. 
So long overshadowed by the dwindling-
oil-reserves crisis — more immediately 
frightening in its projection onto looming 
gas-price marquees and the hurting Power 
Points of enviro-celebrity Al Gore — an 
impending drought of necessary-to-life 
freshwater in so many American regions is 
finally surfacing in the headlines and news 
reels. Not to mention holding its own on 
the utility bill.

Now, more than ever, it is truly upon 

us. The parched San Diego region in which 
UCSD is nestled, particularly North County 
above us, has recently seen somewhat rou-
tine drought warnings reach pitches of 
notable concern: Over the last eight years, 
the banks of key water source the Colorado 
River have narrowed to a devastating rib-
bon, and remaining supplies in Northern 
California were tightened last year for the 
sake of environmental preservation.

So here we are, stranded on a desert 
island, watching (or, more accurately, com-
pletely oblivious) as the spring slows to a 
trickle. When a water-shortage warning 
in July by Mayor Jerry Sanders calling for 
voluntary conservation failed to yield the 
kind of change we needed to survive such 
a drought, the San Diego City Council 
was forced to call for Level 1 emergen-
cy regulations — which, though not yet 
implementing any outside control, strictly 
advised more conservative water usage and 
preluded the almost inevitable Level 2 and 
possible Level 3 regulations expected to be 
declared next year, constricting water con-
sumption mainly in the case of landscape 
management.

Of course, strict mayorial advice con-
cerning something we’ve so long taken for 
granted is just as easy to ignore as the next 
Channel-10-News scare tactic, and admin-
istratively labeled “Levels” can only pretend 
to be getting us somewhere until the well 
really dries up for good. And if the govern-

ment went so far as to limit water use per 
household, we’d be screaming hammer-and-
sickle before they could take a single step 
toward the faucet, which finds us at the same 
predicament we reach when any mindless 
natural-resource indulgence is threatened 
(or, come to think of it, when Election Day 
rolls around): we must somehow convince 
each other that every little bit helps, that we 
can each make a difference, that an extra 10 
minutes of shower for deep conditioning 
could affect something besides our own 
guilty conscience. If we know anything about 
our own developed American nature, we 
should know that even the most earnest call 
for awareness will not be enough to budge us 
from our easy chairs.

The solitary last hope: a swift kick to 
our proud capitalist asses. The only time 
anyone cared to purchase a hybrid vehicle 
was once oil demand had gone so desper-
ate as to open up a business opportunity 
for automobile manufacturers; if all goes 
as planned, we should be able to count on 
greedy, monopolistic utility providers to lay 
down the law we need.

“If the call for conservation continues 
being unsuccessful and mandatory restric-
tions are put in place, agencies’ strategies for 
enforcing those measures will vary. Many will 
turn to financial penalties for excessive use. 
Homeowners … will see a bigger increase in

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 24, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5

ON THE LINE By Christina Aushana

Dear Editor,
Most people, including college 

graduates, are civically illiterate and 
elected officials know even less than 
most citizens about civic topics such 
as history, government and eco-
nomics. More than 2,500 randomly 
selected Americans took a basic 33-
question test from the Intercollegiate 
Studies Institute on civic literacy and 
more than 1,700 people failed, with 
an average score of 49 percent, or 
an “F.” Elected officials scored even 
lower than the general public — with 
an average score of 44 percent — and 
only 0.8 percent (or 21) of all sur-
veyed earned an “A.” Even more 
startling is the fact that over twice 
as many people know Paula Abdul 
was a judge on “American Idol” than 
know that the phrase “government 
of the people, by the people, for 
the people” comes from Abraham 
Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address.

The blame and solution for civic 
illiteracy both lie at the doorstep 
of the nation’s colleges. Colleges, as 
encouraged by the Intercollegiate 
Studies Institute, should prepare 
citizen leaders by teaching America’s 
history, key texts and institutions 
as the current impact of college in 
advancing civic knowledge is mini-
mal. The average score among those 
who ended their formal education 
with a bachelor’s degree is 57 percent 
— or an “F,” which is only 13 percent-
age points higher than the average 
score of 44 percent earned by those 
who hold high school diplomas.

According to the survey results, 
30 percent of elected officials do not 
know that “life, liberty and the pur-
suit of happiness” are the inalienable 
rights referred to in the Declaration 
of Independence and 20 percent 
falsely believe that the Electoral 

College “was established to super-
vise the first presidential debates.” 
Almost 40 percent of all respondents 
falsely believe the president has the 
power to declare war; 40 percent of 
those with a bachelor’s degree do not 
know business profit equals revenue 
minus expenses; only 54 percent 
with a bachelor’s degree correctly 
define free enterprise as a system in 
which individuals create, exchange 
and control goods and resources; 
20.7 percent of Americans falsely 
believe that the Federal Reserve can 
increase or decrease government 
spending.

Engaging in frequent conversa-
tions about public affairs, reading 
about current events and history and 
participating in advanced civic activ-
ities is greater than the gain from an 
expensive bachelor’s degree alone. 
Moreover, elected officials, adminis-
trators, trustees, faculty, donors, tax-
payers and parents must re-evaluate 
collegiate curricula and standards 
for accountability to encourage more 
courses in American history, poli-
tics, economics and other core areas 
and ensure elected officials link col-
lege appropriations to real measures 
of civic or overall learning.

doesn’t sound so unreasonable. 
And while they certainly don’t 

fit the pop-culture-conjured image, 
they do have something in common 
with buccaneers of yesteryear. There 
have been multiple reports of inter-
pirate gunfire (imagine two rowdy 
scoundrels drawing their weapons 
in a rum-fueled dispute). And when 
reminded that his vessel was sur-
rounded by American warships, 
Sugule responded, mysteriously and 
unafraid, “you only die once.”

So what if they don’t have shoul-
der parrots or mast-top spyglass look-
outs, these pirates take their profes-
sion pretty damn seriously, and that’s 
something we should appreciate. 

Plus, with high-seas hijacking on 
the rise, “pirate hunter” might soon 
become a viable career path. Now tell 
me you wouldn’t be psyched to see 
that play out.

their bills,” reported the Voice of San 
Diego news team in November. 

But within this workday world 
existing on rise-and-fall supply and 
demand, there floats a ridiculously 
wasteful, post-high-school bubble the 
size of a small city: Approximately 
10,000 utility bill-free students cur-
rently reside at UCSD, with double that 
amount roaming the campus all day, 
never forgetting — well trained as good 
college students to overutilize anything 
and everything FREE and convenient 
— to set off a few oversensitive auto-
matic toilets and frequent one or two 
wasteful eateries before heading home 
to carefully avoid upping the water bill 
any more than they have to.

Freshmen and sophomores enter 
their SoCal dormitories accustomed 
to the plentiful homes of their parents, 
who more often than not continue to 
pick up the housing-and-dining tab 
while their poor babies settle in to big, 
scary college life. And even if we’re 
paying the fat quarterly bills ourselves 
or through financial aid, water usage is 
never separated out, visually or physi-
cally, as anything within our control. 
Federal regulations mandate only that 
showerheads flow about 2.5 gallons 
per minute, meaning we’ll suck up 
around 40 gallons with one shower 
alone — easy to dismiss on some far-
off, unseeable meter. Then just try to 
imagine all university costs beyond 
the constant trickle of the dorms 

— like running beautiful, scholarly 
fountains or keeping RIMAC Field 
jungle green.

Even further beyond our immediate 
sphere of understanding are the blows 
such a devastating shortage is dealing 
to an already struggling economy.

“Businesses will not move to a city 
with a water crisis and new businesses 
will look to other cities where growth 
is more feasible. The loss of local busi-
ness will quickly impact the city of 

San Diego, lower revenues from sales 
taxes, business license fees and lower 
tax increments from redevelopment 
zones,” said California Water Quality 
Control Board member David King. 
Which eventually means fewer job 
opportunities for we the graduating 
class — but it’s all far too removed 
to provide any illusion of correlation. 
So we spend those extra five minutes 
singing Akon in the shower, because it 
makes this morning that much better.

Unfortunately, small efforts to raise 

awareness — like dorm contests to see 
which suite can use the least amount of 
water and the installation of low-flow 
showerheads (which generally lead to 
longer showers anyway) in a couple col-
leges — hardly amount to preserving a 
single drop from the epic thunderstorm 
of UCSD’s daily water consumption. 
A few unremarkable water-conserva-
tion fliers in a whole wall of calls for 
our attention have nowhere near the 
impact they would need to make a 
difference. It’s a shame, too, seeing as 
the youthful student population could 
potentially be one of the most receptive 
in sympathizing both scientifically and 
socially with the crisis; it would seem, 
in fact, that the university holds more 
tools than anybody to excel in the edu-
cation of conservation. 

Whittling down our habits will 
never be enough; in the not-so-dis-
tant future, saltwater filtering and other 
advancements will be the only remain-
ing options for a growing, demanding 
American population thirsty for their 
100 gallons a day. But until then, and 
surely even then, as worn-thin as the 
concept seems, we must keep constant 
tabs on our intake of Earth’s liquid sil-
ver — where at all possible, with force 
and monetary threat where needed, 
because that’s what it’s going to take.

Outdoor Excursion Org. Hikes to Price Center
By Tamar Freeland
Contributing Writer

A remote building hidden in 
the canyon behind Sixth College is 
home to Outback Adventures, which 
offers a variety of guided tours, rec-
reational excursions and equipment 
rentals to UCSD students.

Next year will mark the com-
pany’s 30th anniversary, and in the 
coming Winter Quarter, Outback 
Adventures will open a retail shop in 
the northwest corner on the second 
level of Price Center in an attempt 
to increase student business.

“The current location absolutely 
inhibits students’ ability to find [the 
gear shop] and take advantage of it,” 
Director of UCSD Recreation Dave 
Koch said. “It is not easily accessible 
or visible. The Price Center shop 
will be a more effective and efficient 
way to serve the students.” 

Before employees can move in, 
a manager must be hired to oversee 
both the original and new locations, 
a staff of about 25 students needs to 
be recruited and the 1,700-square-
foot shop needs stocking.

“The space in Price Center will 
be the face of Outback Adventures,” 
said Tom Rottler, director of outdoor 
recreation at Outback Adventures. 
“It will be primarily surf [oriented] 
with some outdoor products in it 
… there will be some equipment 
that you would regularly see at an 
outdoor shop, but what really drives 
surf shops or outdoor shops now is 
apparel.” 

The new shop will provide sales 

and rentals of outdoor gear, includ-
ing boards, wetsuits, rash guards, 
sandals and T-shirts, some of which 
are expected to increase compe-
tition with Muir Surf and Sport, 
whose management had previously 
sought a storefront in Price Center. 

“Competition is healthy, and that’s 
our philosophy here at this store, 
and people like choices, right?” Muir 

Surf and Sport Shop Manager Scott 
Lembach said. “If I only had one 
skateboard supplier, everyone would 
be riding Gravitys. That would suck.”

Nevertheless, competition is not 
expected to lower prices. Rottler 
said rates will likely stay the same 
for at least a few years while the new 
shop finds its footing. 

If future rates are lowered, Rottler 

expects that outdoor activities 
offered by Outback Adventures will 
be the primary area to see cuts, not 
apparel or gear.

“What I’d love to see happen 
in the future is for prices to be 
lowered for the programs,” Rottler 
said. “Down the road, our goal is to

Ihave a confession to make: This time last year I was a travel vir-gin. 
Excluding the two short and, 

ahem, completely non-substance-
driven trips I’d taken to Mexico, I’d 
never been outside the United States. 
In fact, I had no pressing desire to. 

To me, eating sushi and watching my 
friends abroad travel-whore it up on 
Facebook were international experi-
ences.

I didn’t consider my travel virgin-
ity gasp-worthy until the first day 
of my program when I listened to 
my peers lay out the list of countries 
they’d already visited and a handful 
of other places they’d like to see. The 
less drinkable the water was, the more 
desirable the destination. I gathered

I n the game of gawking at expen-sive real estate, extravagant celebrity mansions in cities such 
as Beverly Hills and Malibu are eas-
ily the most talked-about targets. 
It may, then, come as a surprise 
to debt-ridden Tritons that San 
Diego’s own UC campus currently 
sits on the most expensive hous-
ing market in the nation: Based on 
the recently released Home Price 
Comparison Index by Coldwell 
Banker, La Jolla has been dubbed 
the priciest real-estate market in 
the United States, with the average 
home selling for a whopping $1.8 
million. 

This claim to 
notoriety can be linked 

to a number of culprits. Local 
realtor Nik Mazzola — an employee of 
Andrew Arroyo Real Estate — pointed 
out that a choice few homes are worth 
over $10 million, skewing the average. 
Since February 2008, three homes with 
that sky-high pricetag have been sold, 
the most expensive one going for $16.5 
million. Proximity to the beach and 
a drop in real estate for surrounding 
ZIP codes such as Chula Vista and 
Oceanside have also affected La Jolla’s 
ranking.

“We’re one of the most sought-after 
ZIP codes in the country,” Mazzola 
said. “And this year it appears we are 
the most expensive ZIP code to pur-
chase property in.”

F o r 
those of us 

without a million-
aire budget, finding affordable 

housing in such a swanky area may 
seem like a daunting, if not impos-
sible, task. However, more pratical 
options do exist: condo rentals in La 
Jolla — many of which are located 
in the nearby UTC area — average 
from $1,000 to $2,000 per month, in 
contrast to the average home rent-
al, priced at $4,000 to $10,000 per 
month.

Commuter Student Services is 
a key university housing resource, 
hosting an off-campus housing 
directory that includes rental and 
roommate listings posted specifi-
cally for UCSD students and holds 
several housing workshops during 
Winter and Spring Quarters. 

In addition, students can receive 
one-on-one counseling, housing 
search checklists, average rental 

rates in San Diego and a list of 
apartments close to campus at the 
Commuter Lounge located on the 
first floor of Price Center East.

dents with the most low-cost options 
available. 

“With La Jolla’s rent being so 
expensive, students may come to 
Commuter Student Services to find 
a second roommate, and some stu-
dents end up moving a little further 
away from campus because rent is 
more economical,” Tyus said.

Eleanor Roosevelt College junior 
Haneen Oriqat was thankful for an 
opportunity to remain in the ZIP 
code. She lived in the Costa Verde 
apartments last year, a popular 
housing option for UCSD students, 
paying $2,023 per month with two 
roomates for a three-bedroom,  two-
bathroom apartment. 

“I like living off campus, but on 
campus was a little easier,” Oriqat 
said. “There’s a lot more freedom 

off campus; I got sick of the on 
campus atmosphere.”

However, for all those who prefer 
to roll out of bed 10 minutes before 
class or participate more actively in 
campus events, on-campus housing 
may be a more reasonable choice. 
Currently, a double room in a resi-
dence hall costs $9,506 annually per 
student, while double room apart-
ments go for $9,194 — including 
room and board. Singles are roughly 
$800 more, and triples $750 less per 
year.

Sixth College freshman Denise 
Lem currently lives in her college’s 
residence halls, and plans to contin-
ue living on campus for her sopho-
more year because to her the conve-
nience of living close to class is well 
worth the price.

“I love living on campus because 
we are close to the dining halls and 
all of the other students,” Lem said. 
“Everything is right there.”

jeans — and if I wanted to survive 
in my hard-knock Education Abroad 
Program, I was going to have to invest 
in a pair quick. So, I made friends 
with some prolific travelers, was intro-
duced to EasyJet.com and soon found 
myself with tickets totaling $375 to 
Italy, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands 
and Ireland.

When the first week of travel — 10 
days in Italy and Poland — arrived, I 
packed my tiny North Face backpack, 
conscious that I would not have enough 
fresh socks for the trip. Proud of my 
free-spirited mindset and unaware that 
dirty laundry would soon be the least 
of my problems, I told myself this was 
a sacrifice I’d just have to make.

My first phase of transportation 
involved a two-hour bus ride from 
Lyons to Geneva and a night train to 
Rome six hours later. After an aimless 
walk through the bank district and a 
successful search for the only 24-hour 
liquor store in the city (Geneva sucks), 
we headed to the station and casually 
boarded our train. When we found our 
assigned couchettes (small mattresses 
where one can attempt an anxious, 
sweaty night’s sleep in a compartment 
with five other strangers), they were 
occupied. Sure it was a mistake, we 
showed our tickets to the man in our 
space. 

“Oh,” he said as he looked at the 
date and laughed. “You are in this 
couchette … tomorrow night!”

We stood there, stupefied, and 
then went into panic mode. The train 
was leaving in one minute and we 
were going to be stranded in horrible 
Geneva for the evening. I ran to the 
conductor and begged him to let us

Currently, on-campus housing is 
guaranteed to freshmen and sopho-
mores only.

In lieu of the difficult off-campus 
house hunt, director of Housing and 
Dining Mark Cunningham wants to 
increase the overall number of stu-
dents living on campus, including 
both graduates and undergraduates; 
there are over 10,000 students in 
university housing, and currently 
94 percent of all freshmen and 82 
percent of sophomores reside on 
campus. 

“The goal is to get 50 percent 
of the total population on campus 
… to have 15,000 students living 
on campus of the 30,000 total stu-
dent enrollment anticipated when 
the campus reaches full capacity,” 
Cunningham said in an e-mail. 

In order to reach this goal, new 
residence halls are currently under 
construction, and plans are being 
made to build more in the future. 
In September 2009, transfer student 
housing, located in Eleanor Roosevelt 
College near Cafe Ventanas, will 
open its doors, holding 1,060 beds 
and  hopefully making possible a 
two-year housing guarantee similar 
to that of undergraduates.

In September 2010, construction 
will commence on an 800-bed hous-
ing complex for transfer students 
just north of the Rady School of 
Management, and there will be addi-
tional graduate housing completed 
this academic year in the health 
sciences neighborhood, offering 450 
new on-campus beds.

Ungergraduate housing is grow-
ing branches as well. Within the 
next three years, the housing depart-
ment will make room for 2,500 more 
undergraduates, including 500 new 
beds in Revelle College and 275 in 
John Muir College. From 2012 to 
2013, the university is also looking 
to provide room for approximately 
1,800 beds for junior and senior 

housing.
And it appears these numbers are 

largely in student interest. According 
to Cunningham, the sophomore 
housing acceptance rate has gone up 
by 2 percent over the last five years. 
This may seem nominal, though 
Cunningham noted its significance 
when considering UCSD’s large stu-
dent body. 

“I think it’s due to a combination 
of real estate, gasoline and trans-
portation cost,” he said. “But we see 
demand coming up — we wouldn’t 
be building if demand wasn’t there.”

Moving off campus  is still an 
attractive option. Mazzola explained 
that purchasing a condo in La Jolla is 
a smart choice for students who plan 
to stay in the area for an extended 
period. Housing loans, such as the 
Federal Housing Administration 
loan, allow buyers to close a sale 

after putting only 3 percent down.
“If you are staying in La Jolla for 

four years, instead of renting for 
four years, you could buy through 
the FHA loans, and pay the same 
amount as opposed to renting,” 
Mazzola said. “You could actually 
own it and pay the same.”

Eleanor Roosevelt College soph-
omore Dorothy Hoang lives in an 
off-campus condo about 20 minutes 
away from campus on foot — a one-
bedroom, one-bathroom apartment 
that her family purchased in May 
2002 for $200,000.

Hoang said she prefers the free-
dom of living off campus, as well as 
the significant savings in her situa-
tion. Another advantage of owning 
the condo is that she and her family 
are able to rent it out for additional 
revenue.

“It’s not the most convenient 

thing, but living off campus saves 
you thousands of dollars,” Hoang 
said. “The responsibilities you learn 
from it are worthwhile. It’s a heads-
up for the future and living on your 
own.”

Despite living in a city of mil-
lionaires, a little borrowed cash and 
some creativity can allow students to 
find the right housing option in a sea 
of mansions and summer homes. 

“I think if you’re smart, you’re 
going to look a lot earlier than the 
average student. I’ve seen college stu-
dents get unbelievable deals by using 
all of their resources, which includes 
online, Craigslist, real-estate agents 
and the [San Diego Union-] Tribune,” 
Mazzola said. “Exhaust all of your 
resources.”

Converting living rooms or lofts to bedrooms in shared apartments off campus is popular among students such as Revelle 
College junior Wendy Chao, who make such rennovations to lower the cost of residing in such an expensive community.

on the train. 
He glared at me with his sharp, piti-

less eyes and said, “No.”
With a pathetic puppy look, I asked 

again. As another conductor blew the 
whistle for the train doors to close he shot 
us a resentful glance and said, “OK, you go 
to second class and if I don’t have space in 
Briga you’re getting off.” 

We thanked him and booked it to 
the far end of the train. To protect our 
luggage, we agreed to take turns sleep-
ing throughout the night. Around 1 
a.m., another conductor found us and 
led us into a couchette. Even though it 
was the most claustrophobic sleeping 
nook I’d ever been offered, I scrunched 
my body gratefully into the space and 
wondered what I’d gotten myself into.

The next morning I woke up to a 
hot and sweaty Rome and headed to 
my new sleeping location — my friend 
of a friend’s (who happened to be in 
Greece for the weekend) couch. When 
my traveling buddies and I met his six 
other male roommates — the majority 
being college guys from California — I 
couldn’t help but feel like I was back 
in San Diego, camping out on a ran-
dom acquaintance’s beer-stained futon. 
Never mind my sleeping space, after 
nearly two months of broken com-
munication and formal dining with my 
French family, Rome’s English-friend-
ly attitude combined with a couple 
rounds of flip-cup made me feel suspi-
ciously comfortable.

That ended quickly after our flight 
from Rome to Danzig, when we arrived 
in the ghetto airport at 1 a.m. with-
out our hostel address (one might say 
this was due to blatant irresponsibility, 
but I’d like to say it was self-imposed 
discomfort). After a 40-minute fiasco 
with our taxi driver (we said Lucky 
Hostel, he took us to Lucky Hotel), 
we arrived to what was essentially an 
extra IKEA-furnished room in a Polish 
family’s house (not so lucky after all). 

So, it wasn’t until I got to Mama’s 
Hostel in Krakow that I finally dis-
covered an underground community 
of world travelers composed of poor 
20-somethings, creepy men and doting 
grandmothers.

Our first night there was Halloween, 
and to participate like a good American, 
I tied two dirty socks to my hoodie, 
smeared some mascara on my face 
and claimed to be a puppy. After meet-
ing some other international travelers 
over vodka, I drunkenly admitted to 
my new friends that the socks on my 
head were extremely filthy. When they 

formed a five-inch circle of distance 
around me, I realized that my free-
spirited packing decision was nothing 
to brag about.

At an undeterminable point in the 
night I got a kebab with an Australian 
girl. She told me she’d been traveling 
for eight months and I asked her if she 
was tired of it yet. “God yes!” she said. 
She told me she hated going from city 
to city to see monuments that meant 
nothing to her, she hated always being 
worried her stuff would get stolen and 
she hated living out of a small bag. 

“Then why travel?” I asked. Her 
expression suddenly changed to some-
thing reminiscent of the glazed look 
that I’d seen in the eyes of my voyage-

addicted peers. 
“To see the world,” she said.
The next night, I returned to my 

hostel bed to find a 60-year-old Polish 
woman in it. Then my 31-year-old 
Russian roommate came into the room 
and, after I refused to read him a person-
al passage from my journal, he snatched 
it from my hands. When I recovered it, 
he laughed and asked me mockingly, 
“What are you going to write now? 
‘Dear diary, you would not believe what 
just happened. You were just stolen 
from me this very moment!’” 

I laughed back, half amused and 
half freaked out that I was going to 
have to sleep in the same room with 
this guy. Later in the night I silently 
entered the room, careful not wake 
my elderly roommate, and noticed my 
journal, which I had stuffed deep inside 
my backpack before leaving, under the 
Russian man’s pillow. This was when 
I learned rules one and two of hostel 
life: 1) when it comes to your property, 
no item, whether it be dirty socks or a 
book full of your personal thoughts, is 
safe and 2) you will inevitably have to 
sleep in a room with someone creepy. 

The next day I took a shower (rule 
three: always bring flip-flops) and 
had a quiet breakfast with the Polish 
woman before I flew back to France. 
When I finally made it to my apart-
ment in Lyons, I dropped all of my 
valuable belongings in the center of my 
room, exchanged my filthy clothes for 
new ones and sat down for dinner with 
my French family.

“How was Italy? How was Poland? 
What did you see?” they asked.

As I took a moment to organize my 
thoughts in French, I realized, amid night 
trains, makeshift beds and creepy room-
mates — all aspects of my attempt to see 
the world on a budget — I didn’t pay much 
attention to the sights. 

“I’ll show you some pictures of 
buildings after dinner,” I said, plung-
ing into my meal.

reduce prices as much as possible.”
Outback Adventures offers nature 

outings that vary in activity, location, 
length, space and price. Hiking, surf-
ing, snorkeling, rock climbing and 
yoga are among the options. Staff 
members also design custom adven-
tures by arranging destinations, res-
ervations and equipment. For the 
independent outdoor enthusiast, 
rentals are available for everything 
from GPS units to ice axes.

Participation in programs is 
open to students, faculty, staff and 
UCSD recreation cardholders. The 
general public and community 
members are invited to join as well, 
but advertising is aimed solely at 
the campus community. 

Revelle College junior Kellie Lim, 
while familiar with Outback Adventures’ 
excursion options, has never participat-
ed in any of their programs. 

“I’d be interested in doing stuff 
like that,” Lim said. “I just don’t take 
the initiative. Prices wouldn’t deter 
me. It all looks reasonable, it’s just 
making the time.” 

Other students, however, feel 
that prices are too expensive. 
Revelle College freshman Sasha 
Schukin, who has many outdoor 
interests including hiking, biking 
and running, prefers an indepen-
dent approach. 

“If I wanted to do something 
like that I’d just do it on my own 
[because] you have to pay a lot of 
money,” he said. 

Among the more popular 
trips offered are the Wilderness 
Orientations, which take place in 
late summer and include backpack-
ing in the Sierra Nevada, canoeing 
down the Colorado River or kayak-
ing in Baja California.

“Wilderness Orientation is all about 
being in the wilderness and how that 
transitions to UCSD,” Sixth College 
senior and Outback Adventures 
employee Jessica Mulaney said. 

Eleanor Roosevelt College senior 
Courtney Smith participated in a Bahía 
de Los Angeles Kayaking Wilderness 
Orientation and said it continues to 
affect her UCSD experience.

“It was amazing,” Smith said. “It 
really increased my self-confidence, 
something that has helped me so 
much in the past three years of my 
college experience with everything 
from living in the dorms to studying 
abroad.” 

Eleanor Roosevelt College senior 
Erika Kociolek, a friend of Smith’s 
from the trip, felt that her experience 
better prepared her for UCSD.

“[Wilderness Orientation] 
helped me make the transition 
to college by giving me a small-
scale preview of the emotional 
rollercoaster of move-in day and 
Welcome Week,” she said. “The 
experience of going to a new place 
not knowing anyone helped me 
overcome my shyness so that when 
I did meet my roommates, suite-
mates and classmates, I already had 
practice in getting to know a totally 
new group of people.”

Beginning Winter Quarter, 
Outback Adventures will have a new 
face on campus, but whether interest 
will increase is uncertain. Rottler 
remains hopeful. 

“It’s great to know that we’re going 
to have the exposure that the pro-
gram needs,” Rottler said. “It’s really 
exciting to see where the program 
will go from here.”

sent down a kill to give the Tritons 
match point, but CSU Los Angeles 
would not go away. Two critical 
blocks by the Golden Eagles’ senior 
setter Ursula Vieira, a CSU Los 
Angeles service ace and a Triton 
attack error gave life to the Golden 
Eagles, who were playing with their 
backs to the wall.

Carrying the momentum from 
the previous game, the Golden 
Eagles jumped out to a 12-7 lead 
early in the fourth set. UCSD came 
back to tie the score following a run 
that ended with an ace by junior 
outside hitter Karen Reis, but CSU 
Los Angeles quickly answered back 
with two straight points. Neither 
team gave ground and the score 
remained within a point until the 
Golden Eagles were able to pull 
together and force an attack error 
following a kill to tie the match at 

two games apiece.
After dropping two sets that 

could have ended the match, the 
Tritons came out in the fifth game 
focused and determined. UCSD 
looked as if it would take the game 
as three kills by Carpenter helped 
secure an early 8-4 lead. Carpenter 
chipped in two more kills and 
Schmidt added another, which 
forced a final timeout by CSU Los 
Angeles. The Golden Eagles came 
out of the timeout rejuvenated, 
scoring five of the next six points 
to tie the score at 12. A kill by the 
Golden Eagles and a UCSD attack 
error ended the Tritons’ champion-
ship hopes in heartbreaking fash-
ion. 

“We came in really confident 
and ready to play,” sophomore out-
side hitter Lauren Bradley said. 
“It was really disappointing that it 
didn’t go our way — and it really 

hurts — but we’re proud of how far 
we made it as a team.”

Bailey finished the night with 
team-high 21 kills while junior set-
ter Elaine Chen tallied 60 assists, 
six digs and four kills. In addition, 
the freshman duo of Condon and 
Williamson contributed 13 kills 
and eight kills respectively. 

Despite the sudden and unex-
pected end to the season, Black said 
he feels the team learned many les-
sons to carry into next year.

“I think they’re going to keep 
going strong,” Black said of his 
players. “The girls are really pas-
sionate about the game, and they 
love the team. They come into the 
gym everyday excited to get better, 
and those are the kind of character-
istics that are important.”

goals to take a 17-1 lead at half-
time. UCSD never let up, scoring a 
season-high 24 goals in the contest 
to earn its 19th victory of the year. 

“The first game was not much 
of a game — we were dominant,” 
Harper said. “Claremont had to 
play earlier in the day and they 
weren’t up to the challenge of play-
ing us.”

 Fourteen players scored for 
UCSD with junior two-meter 
Daniel Garcia netting a team-high 
four goals. Junior driver Knief 
Lohse, junior utility Sean Roberts 
and Kotanjian each scored three 
times in the Triton victory. Senior 
driver Adnan Jerkovic, senior 
driver Sidd Menon, junior two-
meter defender Steven Donohoe 
and freshman driver Graham Saber 
scored two goals apiece.

UCSD’s second game of the 
tournament was much more dif-
ficult as the Tritons faced off with 
the Aggies in the semifinal match-
up. UCSD had won both games 
between the teams earlier this sea-
son, but this contest was anybody’s 
game from the beginning. The 
Tritons and Aggies scored three 
goals apiece in the first quarter and 
after UC Davis took a 6-5 lead in 
the second period, Jerkovic evened 
things out with a score to close out 
the quarter all tied up.

The third period proved to be 
the deciding quarter as the Tritons 
outscored the Aggies 2-1 backed by 
strong play from freshman goal-
keeper David Morton, playing in 
his first conference championship.

“Adi and A.J. had good games 
and David Morton was huge in the 
cage — he played very well,” Harper 

said. “It was good to win the game 
even though we didn’t play well 
as a group. To their credit, Davis 
played very well but we played well 
enough to win.”

Even though the loss in the 
WWPA championship game was 
disappointing for the Tritons, their 
appearance in the title game and 
the 20-11 final season record was 
an improvement over last season’s 
fifth-place finish and 12-17 record. 
UCSD was obviously aided by the 
return of Kotanjian and Jerkovic 
this season, who were both named 
to the WWPA All-Tournament first 
team after the championship game. 
Garcia also earned conference hon-
ors as he was named to the WWPA 
All-Tournament second team.

opening half. Senior center Alexis 
Gaskin hit a jumper with two sec-
onds left on the clock before the 
break to send UCSD into halftime 
with a 31-27 lead.

The Tritons 
again jumped out 
to a quick start to 
launch the second 
period, taking a 10 
point lead at the 
14:36 mark off of 
a layup by Osier. 
However, the 
reigning GNAC 
champions were 
not done, storm-
ing back with a 13-

lead 50-48 at the 
6:30 mark. 

Despite the 
Tritons’ best efforts to retake the 
lead, the Falcons held on to their 
advantage and a Martin shot in the 
lane with 13 seconds left rimmed 
out to seal the win for Seattle 
Pacific University. 

Gaskin and Osier, both named 

to the all-tournament team, each 
finished with 16 points and eight 
rebounds, while Ilg chipped in 12 
points and two steals. 

“We played hard for prob-
ably 35 minutes, 
but the minutes 
where we let up 
were costly,” Osier 
said. “They made 
a few adjustments 
defensively and 
that had a huge

WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL — The 
No. 11 UCSD women’s volleyball 
team started out strong against No. 
21 Cal State Los Angeles in the first 
round of the NCAA West Regional 
Thursday night by winning the first 
two sets, but the Tritons faltered 
and lost the next three sets 24-26, 
19-25, 26-24, 25-23, 15-13, ending 
their title hopes.

After the loss, UCSD head coach 
Tom Black thanked the team for its 
hard work and dedication through-
out the season.

“There is only so much you can 
say at that kind of moment,” he 
said. “All you can ask for in sports 
is a chance — and we had it. It 
didn’t end up how we wanted, but 
we put ourselves in position and 
that’s all I could ask for.”

Going into the match, the sev-
enth-seeded Golden Eagles (21-7) 
were the sole California Collegiate 
Athletic Association team that the 
second-seeded UCSD (21-7) team 
had not beaten previously this year. 
The playoff match was similar to 
the teams’ Nov. 17 contest, when 
the Tritons took a two-set lead but 
were unable to put away CSU Los 
Angeles and lost in five games.

The Tritons jumped out to an 
early 12-5 lead in the first game 

behind three kills from senior out-
side hitter Rebecca Bailey and an 
ace by defensive specialist Michelle 
Torres. A run by CSU Los Angeles 
was halted by freshman outside hit-
ters Hillary Williamson and Katie 
Condon, who teamed up to send 
down consecutive kills, keeping a 
six-point UCSD advantage intact. 
Following a timeout, the Golden 
Eagles went on a 6-0 run to take 
a brief lead at 19-18 before the 
Tritons responded with a rally of 
their own. Senior outside hitter 
Kimberly Carpenter and Condon 
came back with three kills in a cru-
cial run that tied the score at 24. A 
block by Bailey and junior outside 
hitter Sylvia Schmidt along with 
a CSU Los Angeles attack error 
ended the first set for UCSD. 

Bailey and Condon wreaked 
havoc on the Golden Eagles at 
the start of the second set as the 
duo combined for six kills, giv-
ing the Tritons a 14-9 lead. CSU 
Los Angeles made a slight come-
back to bring the score within 
two, but Bailey and Condon again 
responded with an ace and a kill, 
giving UCSD a 24-16 edge. CSU 
Los Angeles mustered three more 
points before Schmidt put down 
the Tritons’ final kill. 

The third game was closely con-
tested, featuring nine ties before 
the Tritons held a 15-12 lead mid-
way through the set. Four kills 
by four different Tritons extended 
the lead to six points before a 6-1 
scoring run by the Golden Eagles 
brought the score to 23-22. UCSD 
showed signs of life as Williamson

MEN’S WATER POLO — For the 
fourth time this season, UCSD fell 
to Loyola Marymount University 
in a close contest. The latest defeat 
holds the most weight, however, 
as it came in the Western Water 
Polo Association championship 
game on Nov. 23. The No. 8 Lions 
used a five-goal offensive outburst 
in the second period to defeat 
the No. 9 Tritons 12-10. The loss 
came on the heels of a thrilling 
10-9 UCSD victory over No. 11 UC 
Davis on Nov. 22 and a 24-8 rout 
of host Claremont-Mudd-Scripps 
on Nov. 21. The Tritons end their 
season with a 20-11 while Loyola 
Marymount University advances to 
the NCAA Final Four at Stanford 
on Dec. 6.

The first seed Lions and second 
seed Tritons had met in the WWPA 
finals six times previously and with 
the two squads having been the 
only conference teams to win the 
title in the past eight seasons, the 
matchup was no surprise.

“It is 100 percent what we want-
ed and as it should be,” head coach 
Denny Harper said of the two teams 
facing off in the championship. 

UCSD came out strong in the 
first quarter, outscoring the Lions 
2-1 in the period. Both offenses 
heated up in the second period 
while the Triton defense struggled, 
allowing the Lions to score five 
times. UCSD netted three goals 
in the period and entered the half 

trailing 6-5. 
The Tritons took advantage of 

LMU miscues to get on board twice 
to start the third quarter, the first 
score coming off a five-meter pen-
alty shot and the second from a six-
on-five opportunity. The Lions tied 
the game at seven on the ensuing 
possession and regained the lead 
just 40 seconds later with 4:10 left 
in the quarter. Both teams added a 
goal apiece to keep the Lions on top 
9-8 heading into the final period.

With time running out in the 
game, the Tritons needed to out-
score Loyola Marymount in the 
final period to keep their season 
alive. But the Lions had other plans, 
scoring first in the fourth quarter 
and playing tight defense to earn 
the 12-10 championship victory. 

Senior utility A.J. Kotanjian 
scored five times and junior two-
meter Daniel Garcia scored twice 

for the Tritons, with only three 
other plays netting goals for UCSD. 
The Lions, on the other hand, had 
a more balanced attack with seven 
players contributing offensively. 

While the Tritons’ road to the 
WWPA title match was by no 
means easy, their first game of 
the tournament was essentially a 
glorified warm-up as UCSD dis-
mantled Claremont-Mudd-Scripps 
following the Tritons’ first-round 
bye. Playing in its second game of 
the day, Claremont-Mudd-Scripps 
looked flat against the fresh UCSD 
team, allowing the Tritons to jump 
out to a dominating 9-1 advantage 
in the first quarter. 

The Tritons somehow managed 
to be even more dominant in the 
second period, holding their oppo-
nent scoreless while adding eight

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — A day 
after the UCSD women’s basketball 
team lost to No. 22 Seattle Pacific 
University, the Tritons got defen-
sive against Western Washington 
University to finish 1-1 at the Great 
Northwest Athletic Conference/
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association Classic. 

Senior forward Michelle Osier 
scored 21 points and pulled down 
10 rebounds to lead UCSD to a 
60-52 victory over the Western 
Washington Vikings (2-1) on 
Saturday night. 

“We really got after it defen-
sively for a full 40 minutes tonight,” 
head coach Charity Elliot said. “I 
thought we did an excellent job 
of keeping our composure and 
weathering the storm when they 
made their run. It was a great team 
effort and we beat a very, very good 
team.”

The Tritons got off to a quick 
start and used a 14-0 run in the 
first half to take a 16-point lead 
over the Vikings at the 6:09 mark. 
Junior guard Leilani Martin capped 
off the rally with five of her 11 
points on the night. 

UCSD went into the break with 
a 28-16 lead and didn’t dial down 
its intensity at the start of the sec-
ond period. The Tritons went on 
an 8-0 run fueled by steals from 
Osier and junior guard Annette Ilg 
and took a 40-22 lead, their biggest 
of the game, with 14:48 left in the 
contest. 

Western Washington chipped 
away at the lead over the next 13 
minutes and came within six points 
with less than two minutes to play. 
All hope of a comeback, howev-
er, was cut short with a transition 
bucket by Ilg that put the game out 
of Viking reach. 

Defense led the way for the 
Tritons, as the Vikings went with-
out a field goal for the final 1:43 
of play — and it wasn’t just during 
the final two minutes that UCSD 
clamped down. The Tritons held 
Western Washington to 18-61 
shooting (29.5 percent) and forced 
30 turnovers with a season-high 
19 steals.

Osier said that their defensive 
effort helped the Tritons on the 
offensive side of the ball as well.

“We played some of the best 
defense — 100 percent team 
defense,” she said. “We were rotat-
ing well and it really jumpstarted 
our offense. It was so much fun 
playing with that much energy.”

In addition to her team-high 
totals in points and rebounds, 
Osier finished with six steals, while 
Ilg tallied 11 points, five rebounds 
and four steals. 

Against No. 22 Seattle Pacific 
on Friday night, UCSD came out 
strong despite the long journey to 
arrive at Bellingham, Wash. The 
Tritons scored the first six points 
of the game and never trailed in the 

FINAL FOUR BID FALLS SHORT

The Tritons finished the season with an impressive 20-11 record, but they were unable to defeat Loyola Marymount this season, falling to the Lions four 
times. UCSD was outscored 5-3 in the second quarter of the WWPA championship game against the Lions, ultimately leading to the team’s defeat.

WEEK OF NOV 24-30

MON NOV 24

A R T S

As You Like It - One of Shakespeare’s early 
plays, As You like It is a stock romantic com-
edy. The plot is very simple: the resolution 
of the dramatic problem in the warped 
attitudes of two evil brothers toward good 
brothers, and related obstacles to marriage 
for several couples in the play (most notably 
Rosalind and Orlando) are easily overcome, 
and a happy ending is never in doubt. At 
its center, As You like It presents us with the 
respective worldviews of Jacques, a chroni-
cally melancholy pessimist preoccupied with 

the negative aspects of life, and Rosalind, 
the play’s heroine, who 
recognizes life’s difficulties 
but holds fast to a positive 
attitude that is kind, play-
ful, and, above all, wise. In 
the end, the enjoyment that 
we receive from the play’s 
comedy is reinforced and 
validated by a humanistic 
philosophy gently woven 
into the text by a benevolent 
Shakespeare.  Student: $10, 
Staff/faculty: $12, GA: $20, 
Senior Citizens: $12. 8pm 
at the La Jolla Playhouse 

(Sheila and Hughes Potiker Theatre).
