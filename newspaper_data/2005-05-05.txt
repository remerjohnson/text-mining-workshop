Lawmaker proposes 
expulsion for 'ri~ting' 
Legislation would punish 
students for breaking law 

By JACLYN SNOW 
Contributing Writer 

A new bill under consider-
ation in the state Senate would ask 
administrators of the University 
of California and California State 
University systems and leaders at 
the state's community colleges to 
expel students found guilty of riot-
ing. 

SB 337 proposes to immediate-
ly suspend students attending the 
state's public colleges for at least 
one year if they are found guilty 
of. among other thing , being in 
attendance at a riot, initiating a 
mass disturbance or talcing part in 
an "assembly for the purpose of 
disturbing the public peace." 

"We've had a number of cases, 
especially in San Luis Obispo, of 
unacceptable behavior stemming 
from Mardi Gras parties ... [and) 
in cases at [UC Davis) and in 
Santa Barbara and Shico where 
parties have gone from a number 
of students having a good time 
to excessive behavior and need-
ing to call in police officers to 

restore peace," said Tom Kise, 
a spokesman for state Sen. Abel 
Maldonado (R-San Luis Obispo), 
the bill's sponsor. 

The plan has received support 
from UCSD Police Department 
Chief Orville King because it 
would give more tools and options 
to 1aw enforcement personnel. 

"It has such a long-reaching 
effect that would be useful for 
schools that do have problems and 
would give us the means if there 
were any problems on this cam-
pus," King said. However, King 
said rioting has not been a problem 
atUCSD. 

"There has never been a situ-
ation like that at this campus, and 
I've been here just short of three 
years," King said. "We just haven't 
had those types of problems on this 
campus." 
. In addition to the minimum 

one-year expulsion, students would 
lose their Cal Grant eligibility for 
two years under the proJ>!lsed plan.

Study paints religious pidure 
Seventy-nine percent believe in God 

By CHllmNE CLARK 
Staff Writer 

Four out of every five college 
freshmen believe in a monotheistic 
God and many pray on a regular 
basis, a new major study on student 
spirituality has reported. 

Based on answers from 112,000 
freshmen of various religious back-
grounds studying at 236 universities, 
the new data gathered by UCLA's 
Higher Education Research Institute 
present a unique view of student reli-
gious and spiritual beliefs, according 
to the institute's director, Alexander 
Astin. 

The report was the first of its Jcind, 
according to HERl postdoctoral fellow 
and research analyst Alyssa Bryant. 

"Our rationale in undertalcing the 
study was that, for too long, higher 
education has tend«d to igpore the 
'interior' lives of students, focusing 
instead on the exterior - grades [and) 
test performance," Bryant stated in an 
e-mail. "We believe that there are 
additional dimensions - purpose, 
meaning, personal values and beliefs 
- that deserve attention as well." 

The study revealed that 79 percent 
of the students surveyed believe in God 
and that 60 percent pray often. In addi-
tion, the survey concluded that 80 per-
cent of the students discuss spirituality 
with other students and friends. The 
report also showed that 74 percent 
of students said they feel they have a 
personal connection with God. 

"I think [we) did dIe report because 
we feel the universities have focused

Publishers threaten suit over eReserves 
By SHANNON ELIOT 

Senior Staff Writer 

After months of conflict and 
failed negotiations, the University 
of California and the Association 
of American Publishers remain 
at odds over the legality of elec-
tronic reserves, a free service 
that allows faculty and students 
to access course materials online. 
While both sides said they would 
prefer to cooperate in altering the 
current practice as the preferred 
method of resolving the dispute, 
AAP has made clear that it will 
pursue litigation against the uni-
versity if no other viable option 
exists. 

AAP claims that eReserves is in 
violation of the "fair-use" clause 
in federal copyright law, which 
specifies conditions for legal usage 
of portions of copyrighted text for 
commentary or criticism. 

"AAP members are understand-
ably concerned that faculty may 
increasingly be utilizing eReserves 
programs to provide required 
course readings to students in a 
manner that is tantamount to pro-
viding 'electronic course packs,'" 

AAP Vice President for Legal and 
Government Affairs Allan Adler 
said. 

The publishers initially con-
tacted UCSD officials last June 
regarding certain copyrighted 
posti ngs made on the campus 
library's Web sites. In addition, 
the organization met with UC 
officials in November to discuss 
the possibility of adopting pro-
cedures through which the uni-
versity system could legally grant 
access of, copyrighted materials 
to students and other appropriate 
parties. 

Now the university's attorney 
has said that the campus made sig-
nificant changes in how it conducts 
the transfer of clectroruc copyright-
ed material, while AAP maintains 
that the changes are not acceptable. 

UC Office of the General 
Council at torney · Mary 
MacDonald said she conduct-
ed her own investigation of the 
matter at UCSD, composing a 
letter to the publishers in which 
she outlined various steps that 
the university had undertaken

Admissions by Exception pro-
gram that would allow students

if their students demonstrate aca-
demic excellence in college. 

Council Caucus 
The council discussed the 

upcoming 2005-06 A.S. bud-
get. A.S. President Christopher 
Sweeten told the council that it 
will have almost $100,000 less to 
allocate than the 2004-05 school 
year. In addition, the council will 
£:ace increased contributions to the 
United Stares Student Association, 
which has threatened to freeze 
UCSD's voting privileges in 
response to the council's outstand-
ing debt. He also reported that the 
costs of A.S. services are projected 
to increase next year. 

Council members suggested 
that the lack of voting privileges 
might not impact the national stu-
dent organization, which lobbies 
legislators in Washington, D.C. 
Vice President External Kevin 
Mann said that the funds need to 
be paid to USSA in order for the 
group to effectively advocate on 
behalf of student interests. 

Based on the projected costs, 
Sweeten said that the cabinet sug-
gested cuts to all budget items in 
order to minimize the losses to 
anyone program, including A.S. 
stipends. ERC Junior Senator 
Bryce Murray said that he sup-
ports the complete elimination 
of A.S. stipends, which cost the 
council approximately $36,000 in 
the 2004-05 school year.

Twelve UC researchers 

eleded to NAS 
The National Academy of Sciences 

has announced that 12 research-
ers affiliated with the University of 
Califomia are among its 72 newly 
elected members this year. No other 
university in the world claimed more 
than six spots in this years election. 

Every. year, the organization's 
members pick among new candi-
dates based on their achievements in 
the fields of scientific and engineering 
research. Election to membership in 
the academy is considered one of 
the top honors accorded to American 
engineers and scientists. 

"Election to the National Academ~ 
of Sciences is an exceptional honor, 
UC President Robert C Dynes - him-
self an NAS member since 1989 
- stated in a university press release. 
"The election of these researchers 
confirms once again the strength of 
our faculty in mathem~tics, science 
and engineering.· 

Overall, UCLA led the university 
. with four new memberships, trailed 

by UCSD and UC Berkeley with three 
each. UC Santa Barbara had two pro-
fessors on the list 

At UCSD. the honorees induded 
bioengineering department chair Shu 
Chien, political science department 
chair Gary Cox and pharmacology 
professor Michael Karin. 

Cox was one of only two political 
scientists chosen by the academy. 

Incorporated by Con~s in 1863 
- when it was approved by President 
Abraham Lincoln - the private orga-
nization serves as the government's 
official adviser on the topics of sci-
ence and technology. 

Grads likely to face 
stiff job competition 
Though graduating college 

seniors will be entering one of the 
best job markets in recent years, 
most will still likely face off against a 
highly competitive pool of contend-
ers, online career services provider 
Monster has reported in an annual 
survey. 

Almost two-thirds of employers 
told the company that they expect-
ed at least 25 applicants to com-
pete for every new job opening. 
the MonsterTRAK student recruitment 
unrtconduded in the repo~ 

·Our survey results confirm that 
in order to stand out from the crowd, 

entry~evel job seekers must be vigi-
lant about the search process: Senior 
Vice President Michelle Forker stated 
in a company announcement. "For 
many, the transition from school to 
the working world can be both excit-

... 

ing and daunting; smart graduates will 
successfully enter this next phase by 
approaching the job hunt with gusto 
and creativity." 

Forker told students to begin 
speaking with campus counselors 
well ahead of time and to approach 
faculty and alumni for contacts in vari-
ous industries. 

One-thi rd of employees reported 
to the survey that they considered 
relevant work experience as the most 
important factor in deciding on new 
hires. Almost a third also said that 
the biggest mistake of college gradu-
ates in interviews is not canying out 
enouRll research about the company 
and tlie industry. 

Though 72 percent of employers 
said they expected a tha~k-you letter 
or e-mail after interviews, only 38 per-
cent of graduates sent one, Monster 
reported. 

Nixon aide to discuss 
Watergate at talks 
President Richard Nixon's former 

deputy assistan~ Alexander Butterfield, 
who first disclosed to members of 
Congress the existence of Nixon's 
secret Oval Office recording system, 
will appear at two campus talks to 
discuss his fOlTTlef eflllIoyer and the 
history surrounding his disgraced res-
ignation. 

Butterfield's bombshell disclosure 
proved to be vital in documenting 
the scandalous COYef~p by top Ytttite 
House officials. revelations that even-
tuallv pushed Nixon to leave office. 

On May 10, Butterfield will hold 
a talk about Nixon himself and on 
Mav 17 he will follow up with a sec-
ond installment on the Watergate 
controversy. Both talks will begin 
at 7:30 p.m. at the Neurosciences 
Institute. 

New findings may

Researchers at UCSD School of 

Medicine have discovered an unex-

that plays a crucial role in allowing the 
formation of new blood vessels. The 
discovery promises to lead to new 
ways to stop the growth of cancerous 
tumors by cutting off their blood sup-
ply, they reported. ., 

In a study to be published In 
June the researchers wm outline their 
discMry of an important protein that 
puts the finishing touches on new 
blood vessels by allowing two layers 
of blood vessels to recognize e~ 
other and ~nk together .. The .cheml-
cal had previously been identified as 
a key regulator of immune system 
functIOns.

God: University group calls 
for more reflection in study 

continued from page I 
too much on the cognitive aspects of 
education," Association of American 
Colleges and Universities President 
Carol Schneider said. "The idea 
was to focus on the quest for mean-
ing that students go through during 
college." 

Schneider, who helped prepare 
the report, said her organization's 
goal is to help ensure that stu-
dents receive an education that will 
help them become mature citizens 
and prepare them for their future 
careers. T he group has previously 
advocated for a more "holistic" 
approach to higher ed ucation. 

Not all of the results, however, 
were as she had hoped , Schne.ider 
said. 

"I had mixed feelings about the 
findings," she sa id . "I thought it 
offered us an optimistic view on 
students, but on the negative side, 
only 14 percent said they were 
interested in an ecumenical world 
view and only 15 percent scored 
high on charitable involvement." 

Howeve r, Schneider said that 
the study suggests that universities 
should shift some of their current 
focus on academics and job skills 
to include a broader array of topics 
connected to students ' spirituality 
and religiosi ty. 

"Universities teach students to 
think well," Schneider said. "But 
we know that college snldents are 
in a major tate of development, 
yet we do not do nearly enough 
to offer snldents rcOection during 
these developmental years: ' 

encouraging students to reflect 
on larger issues of meaning in 
the classroom," Bryant stated. 
"[Universities should] provide a 
space for multi-faith conversations 
and interactions, or institute ser-
vice-learning curriculum." 

However, public universities 
shouldn't be in the business of 
teaching students to be religious, 
according toJohn H . Evans, UCSD 
sociology professor and faculty 
member at the campus' Program 
for the Study of Religion. 

"I try to make a subtle distinc-
tion," Evans said. "Public universi-
ties should teach students about 
religion and spirituality, but they 
should not to teach them to be 
religious or spiritual because that 
it is in violation of [the division 
between] church and state." 

In addition, he said that fresh-
man data might not reflect the 
opinions of all students because 
it is common for college students 
to become less religious than the 
general population. 

"After students graduate high 
school there tends to be a period 
of less religiosity in college, then 
people go back [to religion] once 
they have chi ldren," Evans said. 

Though there are student-orga-
nized religious groups on campus, 
Thurgood Marshall senior Alexis 
Helesher said tllat UCSD does 
little to help students develop their 
spirituality.

Btyant said that she also believes 
the data indicates that universities 
should be more effective in facilitat-

A.nti,riot bill infringes 
on rights of students 

T he new propos-al being offered by state Sen. Abel 
Maldonado (R-San Luis 
Obispo) embodies most of 
the thinS's that are wrong 
with Cahfornia politics. 

The bill, which would 
force public colleges and 
universities to expel stu-
dents found guilty of "riot-
ing," demonstrates how a 
single lawmaker can hijack 
the fears and mispercep-
tions of the populace to 
offer proposals simply for 

th~ purpose of political 
gain. 

Maldonado's broadly 
written proposal is a clear 
attack on First Amendment 
rights, punishing students 
for offenses as nebulous 
as an "assembly for the 
purpose of · disturbing 
the public peace." As It 
is currently written, the 
bill's proviSIOns could even 
apply to former A.S. Vice 
President External Har.ish 

Nandagopal, who was 
arrest~d last y~ar a~ a rally 
opposing tull:lOn Increas-
es. 

But no amendment, 
no matter how big, can 
correct the fundamental 
errors in principle embod-
ied in the very Jdea behind 
Maldonado's proposa I. 
Nowhere did the Master 
Plan for Higher Education 
suggest that access to uni-
versities should be con-
tingent on good behavior. 
Nor does the California 
Constitution S'ive the 
UniversityofCahfornia the 
responsibility of enforcing 
state penal code. Yet both 
beliefs form the basis for 
the legislation. 

Fortunately, Maldonado's 
bill has no chance of actual-
ly making it out of commit-
tee. Regardless, it is espe-
cially djsturbing that our 
own campus police chjef 
lent his support for a plan 
as flawed as this. 

Watson's beer garden 
denial sadly predictable 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Joseph W Watson's 
decision to reject former 
A.S . President Jenn Pae's 
detailed proposal for a 
Sun God festival beer gar-
den is hardly surpriSing; 
rather, it is in line with 
Watson's history of pay-
ing lip service to students 
wnile pursuing a hard-line 
anti-alcohol agenda. Even 
though he professes to 
have carefu lly considered 
the plan and scrapped it 
because of safety con-
cerns, it seems that no 
plan for a beer garden 
would have ever stood the 
slimmest chance of win-
ning approval. 

Furthermore, Watson's 
conciliatory, contradicto-
ry defense, that he's " not 
opposed to a beer garden, 
and we have no objec-
ti olls to it, " reeks of dis-
inge nuousness . The vice 
cha ncellor shou ld come 
clea n and admit that he 
does object to beer gar-
dens, and there 's little or 
nothing students can do 

to make him cha nge his 
mind . 

While Watson's con-
cerns about student alcohol 

consum~tion may be legiti-
mate, its unfortunate that 
he is so unyielding, even 
after Pae did her best to 
address all the worries any 
reasonable person would 
have about the beer gar-
den . Watson consistently 
denies that students can be 
responsible, opting instead 
to unreasonably assume 
that serving a drop of 
beer wjll make the event's 
safety fly out the window. 
It's obviously easier for his 
office to pursue an inflex-
ible agenda instead of pay-
ing attention to the desires 
otUCSD students, but it's 
not a thoughtful or wise 
style of leadership - and 
particularly odious given 
UCSD's stagnant campus 
social scene. 

We challenge Watson to 
pdate his dogmatic stance 

on alcohol on campus -
and to stay sober during 
this year's Sun God festi-
val.

Attack on filibusters latest 
outrage from conservatives 

Lines in 
the sand 

Ian s. Port 

W hile I normally spend hundreds of words tell-ing stories and giving 
examples to prove exactly how 
undemocratic, socially regressive 
and mean-spirited the political 
objectives of the so-cal led "con-
servative movement" are, this time 
all J need to do is tell you what 
they call the latest shenanigan-cum-
srab-at-democratic-freedom: 

The Nuclear Option. 
(It's the lcind of sick euphemism 

that comes out when a "demo-
cratic" country is really run by 
an oligarchy of corrupt interests 
through a sinister party that also 
- as if this didn't suck enough 
already - tips its hat to some of 
the most sickeningly arrogant and 
comically juvenile Christians the 
sadly undereducated Bible Belt 
could belch out.) 

Republican senators' heads arc 
buzzing so fast from the rush 
of absolute power that, in the 
push to confirm seven hardcore 
conservative judges to the federal 
bench, they're prepared to change 
a major legislative right - that of 
a sizeable minority to indefinitely 
put off a vote. It's called a filibus-
ter, and it's what happens when 40 
of the Senate's 100 members are 
damn sure something ,.~al/y bad is 
going to happen. 

The Republicanswant to change 
Senate rules so that 51 votes, not 
60, are needed to bring a judge's 
nomination to vote. With this 
accomplished, the minority party 
- Republican or Democratic-
would have no way to stop the 
appointment of judges to either 
the Supreme Court or the federal 
bench if the majority had 51 votes. 

And with their majority on 
the Senate Rules Corrunittee, this 

" Isn't this the 
conservative party? 

That supposedly 
values the document 

that gave special 
safeguards to 

protect the rights of 
the minarity?" 

insanity is entirely up to the Good 
01' Boys to commit at their lei-
sure. 

Why, exactly, is this a terrible 
idea? While it would grant the 
heartbreaking conservative agen-
da even more high-powered allies 
than it already has, the most dis-
turbing aspect of this proposition 
is what it says about the rights of 
political minorities in the eyes of 
the ruling party - namely, that 
they don't get any. 

(Which is a pretty ridiculous 
attitude, considering that this is 

the first time since 1954 that the 
Republicans have had so much 
power. For most of recent politi-
cal history, thty were the minori ty 
- and boy, did they bitch about 
it.) 

Wait ... I'm still balking at what 
a downright attack on the principles 
of the Constitution this is. Isn't this 
the Confl'1'Uar:fvt party? That sup-
posedly values the document that 
gave special safeguards to protect 
the rights of the minority? Didn't 
they read "Federalist #10'" 

Well apparently some of them 
did, because the conservative bloc 
is crumbling - or at least stum-
bling. The polls show the public 
doesn't like the idea of punch-
ing through any traditional walls 
by the party-of-the-moment in 
an effort to please the hardcore 
fundies who wam Roe v. Wade 
overturned and GI Jesus on the 
$20 bill . 

I may regret this (J know my 
e-mail inbox will), but I'm going 
to go out on a limb here and make 
a prediction: The pendulum has 
swung about as far to the right as it 
can - and it's swung pretty damn 
far since just a few years ago. T he 
conservative movement, as strong 
as it appears to be, rides on the 
cooperation of two interests that 
are going to get greedier and less 
congenial as their respective bellies 
611 up. It's the ultra-Christians that 
want madman Bill Frist to use the 
nuke; at the same time, some busi-
ness interests are worried that if 
the bomb gets dropped, and Senate 
Democrats respond the way they 

See COLUMN, Page 5

Democrats 

continued from page 4 
threaten to - by halting any prog-
ress in the Senate - their interests 
won't be met. Can fighting over 
who's first in the .candy line derail 
the seemingly awesome power of the 
conserva ti ve bloc? 

Well, with the Los Angelts Timts 
editorializing about how limp post-
Social Security failure Bush is look-
ing these days, it just might. The 
country has leaped so far to the 
right that to make any more prog-
ress, the grumpy, gray-haired trog-
lodytes on Capitol Hill will have 
to do permanent damage that even 
their massive, shiny propaganda 
machines can't gloss over. 

They're trying, with multimil-
lion-dollar ad campaigns aimed at 
nervous, on-the-fence senators. 
They've telecasted to churches all 
around the country a kindly Biblo-
Ad assuring you that it's your duty 
as a good Christian to harangue 
those evi l Democrats into letting 
them vote on the issue. 

But America isn't going to let 
a change of rules happen, and J 
think irs quickly getting sick of 
the Republ icans' self-centered 
show. Rather than further cement-
ing their grasp on the future, 
Republicans arc going to find that 
playing with nukes - pushing the 
country farther toward an oligar-
chy - is a dangerous ga me. If the 
bomb drops, it won 't just be Senate 
Democrars (or fri ends of democ-
racy) that feel the burn .

Reserves: Publishers focused on 
UCSD due to its complete records 

continued from page I 
to ensure that fair-use principles were in 
effect. 

"I informed them that it was my con-
clusion that fair use had not been violated 
by UCSD, and encouraged them to try to 
work cooperatively on a national scale with 
libraries and universities to reach voluntary 
guidelines for [electronic] reserves rather 
than hinting at legal action against one uni-
versity," MacDonald stated in an e-mail. "I 
received a reply about two months later that 
was essentially dismissive of my letter." 

The university has encouraged the AAP to 
drop threats ofa lawsuitand help create a set of 
voluntary electronic collections that will gain 
approval from the publishers. T he national 
Conference on Fair Use attempted this 10 
years ago, although its members ultimately 
failed in efforts to negotiate an agreement. 
AAP wants facu lty to post all of their elec-
tronic reserve materials for the coming term 
on publicly accessible Web sites to allow AAP 
to monitor usage and determine whether or 
not the readings constitute fair use. 

"We have informed AAP that this is not 
a workable solution for a variety of reasons, 
including that it would be unprecedented for 
the university to require its faculty to under-
take a process designed exclusively to allow 
an outside entity to monitor their activity and 
that the Academic Senate would have to be 
consulted in any event," MacDonald said. 

AAP said it has focused its investigation 
on UCSD because its compiled records were 
the most complete the group had been able 
to obtain from any university. 

"Our focus on UCSD arose from the 
serendipitous receipt of extensive documen-
tation of eReserves postings in successive 
academic terms at that campus, which per-
mitted AAP members for the first time 
to peer beyond the firewalls ... and know 
exactly how reserve programs are being 
implemented for college courses at campuses 
all across the country," Adler stated in an e-
mail to MacDonald. 

Though federal law clearly establishes 
civil litigation as the primary means for 

Billy wong/Guardian 
Contrld: Publishers fear students may forgo pa~ng 
for books if they have access to electronic reserves . 
copyright enforcement, Adler said the group 
believes that suing universities and their fac-
ulty may mean suing some of its members' 
most important customers and authors. 

"While we obviously cannot rule out the 
possibility of litigation against such parties, 
particularly in circumstances where nonad-
versarial efforts have been exhausted with-
out resolving a critical infringement issue, 
AAP prefers, and in the instant matter has 
attempted, to pursue a satisfactory resolu-
tion to the problems we found in UCSD's 
eReserves program through cooperative dia-
logue and suggestions for modest changes in 
academic policies and practices, rather than 
through li tigation," Adler stated.

albu:'" rtvinvs 8 

By ANIA DYLEWSKA 
Senior Staff Writer 

With the dismal failure of epics like "Alexander," "King Arthur" and "The Alamo," at thi s moment, hi storical films about battle-laden quests for goodness seem only 
suitable for the editi ng room rubbish pile. Director Ridl ey 
Scott, the mastermind behind "Gladiator," the last trul y 
appreciated heroic blockbuster, appears ca pable of reviving 
this lackluster genre. However, the formulaic "Kingdom of 
Heaven" is not exactly the right film for the ta sk. 

Set in th e 12th century during the T hird C rusadc, the 
film portrays the battl e for J erusalcm between Christians 
and Muslims. The plotline is based in part on actua l events 
that occurred during the reign of Baldwin IV, the Latin 
king of J erusa lem. The film offers a compelling depiction of 
religious hypocrisy and refrains from vi li fyi ng or typecasting 
the Muslim adversaries. However, the central adventure of 
a common man who has lost his faith and mu t red iscover 
his inherent goodness fall s short in the fundam ental growth 
stage and offers no exciting deviations from the standard 
construction of a hero. 

Balian (Orlando Bloom) is a young, grief-stricken black-
smith who becomes a knight-in-training after Baron Godfrey 
of Ibelin (Liam Neeson blending Priest Vallon from "Gangs 
of New York" and Qui-Gon Jinn from "Sta r Wars" into 
a paternal guide) claims him as his son. Bloom, with his 
honest face and amiable screen charisma, has no problem 
channeling the character's inherent nobility, but he lacks 
the qualities of a leading man . In th e film , Bloom essentially 
p'lays Will Turner from "Pirates of the Caribbean." In that 
film, Bloom's understated emotions worked well to ground 
J ohnny Depp's exuberance, but here, Bloom's minimalist 
acting style makes Balian appear too passive and often all ows 
other characters (particularly those played by morc experi-
enced actors like Jeremy Irons, Brendan G leeson and Da vi d 
Thewlis) to overshadow him. 

Standout performances belong to Eclward orton and 
Eva Green. Norton, as the masked, leprosy-afflicted J(jn g 
Baldwin IV, establishes his character wi th a gently toned 
voiceover that brings a 
natural aura of honor ~ 
and tragedy to his spooky '"' 
presence. Gree n is stun-
ning as Balian 's love 
interest and Baldwin's

Nltln Sawhney 
Philtre 

V2 

**** Listening to Philtre for the first time, I wondered if Nitin Sawhney is a cul-
tural schiwphrenic. The way 
his seventh album moves 
between l.ndian classical, tra-
ditional folic, blues, Bengali 
folic, drum 'n' bass, tradition-
al flamenco, old soul, and 
R&B, can you really blame 
me? After listening to it a few 
more times, though, I grudg-
ingly realized that the beauty 
of his latest album, a radical 
departure from his previous 
politically bent worKs, lies 
in its moving and energetic 

journey through global cul-
ture. 

Sawhney never sings on 
his cracks-rather, with some 
help from Spanish collective 
Ojos de Brujo, Jazzanova's 
Vikter Duplaix, BoUywood 
vocalist Reena Bhardwaj, 
Ninja Tunes' Fink and many 
other artists (including his 
own mother!), he has created 
an album that taKes the lis' 
tener from a shadowy blues 
club in Mississippi to the 
endless energy and furious 
heat of a Spanish fiesta to a 
glitzy BoUywood film set 

Sawhney's passion for 
DJing can also be seen in 
Philtn, as all the tracKs' 
intimate, emotional feel are 
combined with infectious 
beats. 'J ourney" features the 
smooth and deep, breathy 
vocals of Duplaix and builds 
into a heavy drum-and-bass 
traclc, interweaving rhythms 
of voice and instruments 
playing off each other. From 
the ambitious, multilingual 
mix of tracKs in Phi/m, it 
is clear that Sawhnev is one 
of the most versatile' worldly 
musicans today.

HaIIN Up 
Clatter for Control 

Constellation 

It's liKely history will laugh at this writer for giving Clatter for Control any-
thing less than five stars. 
Why the low rating, then? 
WeU, Hanged Up are doing 
something new for rock 
music and, as is always the 
case, taking new directions 
in the arts proves difficult for 
aging critics. 

Hanged Up consist of a 
duo of drums and ... electric 
viola? 

Yes, an llmric viola. 
One may be tempted to 

imagine thj! viola sound-

ing like the rock 'n' wank 
of Yngwie Malmsteen and 
gang. Fortunately, it doesn't 
The pounding drums and 
electric viola create a noise-
rock ensemble that matches 
the power of bands such as 
Lightning Bolt and Hella. 
Hanged Up taKe it a step 
further, though: While those 
groups Bin with the play-
ful and savage, Hanged Up 
remain sophisticated and 
tame, retaining complete 
concrol, even mastery, over 
their respective instruments. 
Gen HeisteK's viola playing 
eschews the raw technique of 
no-wave an punk at its best. 
Percussionist Eric Craven 
doesn't simply provide some 
hi-hat grazing; the man 
poundr. 

This thrilling duo, as a 
result, produces high vol-
umes of feedback and walls 
of viola. Granted, the band 
name pales in comparison 
to its label mates (Godspeed 
You Black Emperor, A Silver 
Mt. Zion), but Hanged Up's 
sophistication easily surpass-
es such bands musically.

The Testament 

Legal Hustle 

**** If you are anything liKe me, you like your women curvy, your weed sticky 
and your hip-hop as grimy 
as it was ' in the mid-'9Os. 
But things change, and the 
only way to find an album 
with that unpolished sound 
would be to unearth a time 
capsule. 

Luclcily for us, that is 
exactly what happened, as 
Cormega's intended debut, 
The ustJlmmt, has finally 
been released after Def Jam 
shelved it over seven years 
ago. The production on Tht 

urtfl'mmt is refreshingly 
nostalgic, using straightfor-
ward drum beats with creepy 
scring and pianu sa mples 
on top. This setS the stage 
perfectly for Cormega's 
"Scarface"-influenced raps, 
and while his flow is some-
what choppier than it is on 
later releases, he nonethe-
less reminds us why they are 
classics. 

Standout tracks include 
"One Love," his response 
to Nas' song of the same 
title, and "Angel Dust," an 
eerie Sha Money track on 
which Havoc graces the 
hook as Mega raps on the 
street hustle. Solidarity is 
the message on the soulful 
"Every Hood," but the tone 
changes on "Killaz Theme," 
which features Mobb Deep 
hauntingly chanting "We 
want to kill you" over a beat 
that never quite drops. 

Above all, The ustllment 
illuscrates one thing: An 
album that wasn't ready 
for release in 1997 can be 
released in 2005 - and be 
one of the best albums of 
the year.

Kingdom: 
Battle scenes 
the best part 

continued from page 7 
beautiful and exotic sister, Sybilla . 
With a mere glance, the inge-
nue from Bernardo Bertolucci's 
"The Dreamers" manages to cap-
ture Sybilla's sensualiry, strength, 
intelligence, apprehension and 
melancholy. 

Bloom cannot entirely be 
blamed for the flaws in his char-
acter. Scott seems so titillated by 
each progressively larger battle 
that he allows the plot to slide 
into a not-terribly-cohesive back-
ground. Balian's stages of learning 
and his transition into piety occur 
so rapidly that it is not entirely 
clear when they rake place or how 
they resonate with the character. 
One minute Godfrey is teaching 
Balian about the art of fighting, 
and in the ne)(t instant Balian 
- without any practice - turns 
into a brilliant battle scrategist. 

T he battle scenes are the most 
exciting parts of the film , They 
are urgent: The camera zooms 
from the expansive landscape 
of mounting carnage to medi-
um shots of grotesque inj uries, 
and the shifting pace from swift 
attacks to slow-morion trag-
ic downfalls adds intensity and 
tension . Cinematographer John 
Mathieson floods the screen with 
vast, blue-tinted, picturesque set-
tings both beautiful and haunting, 
reflecting the dual nature of the 
devout but brutally violent soci-
ety. Yet, after the release of Peter 
JacKson's "Lord of the Rings" 
tri logy, these elements are not 
as engaging and stirring to the 
imagination. 

As an action-packed epic, 
"Kingdom of Heaven" is not a 
bad film; it manages to capture a 
specific moment in history, and, 
under Scott's experienced care, 
it remains technically superb. 
However, as a study in character, 
it lacks in depth and excitement.

. Crew: Tritons 
anticipate 

strong finish to 
. 

spnng season 
continued from page 1:2 

"The team responded really 
well to lineup changes," Kelly said. 
"During the heats on [Apri l 30), 
the team was still getting used to 
the new lineup, but by [May I) , 
they were used to the lineup and 
it showed. The boat's speed was 
constant, and there weren't any lags 
during the race, which is a good 
sign." 

The varsity four-boat - manned 
by juniors Katie Morris, Christine 
King, and Phoebe Lee and sopho-
mores Helenaz Moteabbed, and 
Megan Harlen at coxswain - came 
in 12th place overall. 

The Triton pair, a two-person 
boat, also had another chance to 
race this season. T he pair finished 
third overall , rrai ling UC Irvine and 
Sacramento State, which fi nished 
fi rst and second, respectively. 

T he varsity lightweight four 
pulled off a third-place finish as 
well, while the second varsity eight-
boat came in 12 th place. 

In the novice competition, 
UCSD's novice lightweight four 
and novice four both finished third 
overall . The novice four-boat came 
in first in its heat, eclipsing Saint 
Mary's by three seconds and fin-
ishing solidly ahead of the other 
competitors. The novice eight-boat 
crossed the fini sh line in fouM 
place - the highest finish among all 
the nonscholarship schools. 

As the season winds down, the 
women's crew team is stiU working 
on its original goals from the begin-
ning of the season. Their focus 
is on the third 500 meters of the 
2000-meter race, to maintain speed, 
consistency and come through in a 
vital part of the race. 

"We 're still working on that 
goal,"' Kelly said. "But the fact that 
the speed was steady this past week-
end was a good sign. Hopefully we 
can make even more progress on 
that third 500 and gain more on 
Humboldt." 

Kelly said that the team's goal 
for the next competition is to beat 
Humboldt and to make an impres-
sion on the NCAA Conunittee so the 
team will be invited to Nationals. 

The Tritons women's crew 
team next competes on May 
14 at the Pacific Coast Rowing 
Championships, also to be held at 
Lalce Natoma.

Tritons go 2-1 en route to third-place WWPA finish 
Women's water polo falls in sudden-death overtime semifinal to host Aggies 

By DANIEL DIAl 
Senior Staff Writer 

The No. 17 UCSD women's 
water polo team put its ability to 
rebound from disappoinonent on 
center stage for the last time in 2005, 
defeating Santa Clara 10-7 to earn a 
third-place finish at the Women's 
Western Water Polo Association 
Championships hosted by UC Davis 
from April 29 through May 1. The 
victory came after the Tritons were 
denied a third consecutive champi-
onship game appearance in a frus-
trating 7-6 defeat to the hosts in 
sudden-death play. 

Leading the way for the Tritons 
during the weekend was senior 
driver Tobi Lyman, who netted 
seven goals en route to earning 
AlI-WWPA First-Team honors. 

enior utility Courtney Clevenger, 
who notched four points in three 
games, and junior goaltender Kaitlin 
Foe were named to the AlI-WWPA 
Second Team while senior two-
meter Lindsay Grossman was select-
ed as an honorable mention. UCSD 
completes its season with an 18-17 
overall record. 

"We definitely played well 
enough to win every game, and in 
sudden death it's really anyone's 
game. In this case, our only problem 
was that we didn't come up with the 
first goal," UCSD head coach Larry 
Sanders said. 

UCSD and Santa Clara battled 
to a 2-2 score in the opening period 
before the Tritons pulled away with 
three consecutive goals to distance 
themselves from their opponents 
and rWl away with the third-place 
finish . The Tritons converted on 
five of their six man-up opportu-
nities. Senior drivet Jessica Wong 
led all UCSD scorers with three 
goals while sophomore two-meter 

arah Bajorek and sophomore utility 

Michelle Perkins were right behind 
with a pair each. Sophomore two-
meter Judy Emaus scored on a man-
up attempt to break the 2-2 dead-
lock with 4 minutes, 45 seconds left 
in the first half, followed up by goals 
from Wong and sophomore driver 
Miho Umezawa which put UCSD 
up 5-2. Perkins responded to a Santa 
Clara tally with a point of her own at 
the I: 11 mark of the second period 
before the Broncos added a man-up 
goal to cut their deficit to two at 
the half. 

Lyman's goal with 6:36 left in 
the third restored the three-point 
advantage, before Bajorek's tally 
exactly four minutes later gave the 
Tritons their largest lead of the 
game. Both teams added a goal in 
the period; UCSD led 9-5 going 
into the final frame before Wong 
followed Catherine Flynn's goal for 
Santa Clara with her third score of 
the game to seal the win. 

"Any team will be a little down 
after losing a big game, but we took 
control after awhile and never let 
up," Sanders said. 

UCSD pulled out some last-
second heroics against the Aggies 
when, following Sarah Rees ' goal to 
put UC Davis up by one with 1: 15 
left in overtime, Bajorek scored on a 
rebound as time expired to send the 
game to a sudden-death period. The 
Tritons could not hol.d off Rees a 
second time, however, as she netted 
the game-winner from seven meters 
out with 1:03 remaining in the first 
sudden-death period to advance her 
team to the championship game for 
the first time in three years. 

"We could have stopped them 
in the last minute of regulation, but 
they also missed a lot of opporruni-
ties as well," Sanders said. The shot 
that [Rees) threw was almost perfect, 
right into the corner; in some sense, 
it was lucky because it was so far 

out, but ruC Davis) went for it and 
made it." 

Seniors scored every UCSD 
goal in the back-and-forth contest, 
as Lyman tallied a hat trick while 
Clevenger added a pair along with 
Grossman's buzzer-beater. After a 
Clevenger goal at the 4:46 mark of 
me second period, me Aggies knot-
ted tI1ings up, only to have Lyman 
score just before halftime to give 
me Tritons a 3-2 lead heading into 
halftime. 

UC Davis rallied from me break 
to put up two consecutive scores, 
me second by Cassie Schafer with 
3 :51 remaining in me third period, 
to give me Aggies their first lead 
since late in me opening frame. 
Clevenger put me Tritons 'level wim 
her goal at the 2:01 mark, followed 
by Lyman's tally to give UCSD me 
lead wim only I :36 left in me fourth 
period. The Aggies, however, made 
the most of UCSD's ejection call 
wim 33 seconds left, converting on 
the six-on-five advantage to send me 
game into overtime. 

In meir opening match of me 
championships, the Tritons had 
more trouble than expected from 
me Sonoma State Sea wolves before 
junior two-meter Kirsten Frazer 
gave UCSD the eventual game-win-
ning goal at me 1 :48 mark in me 
third quarter. After pounding me 
Seawolves by scores of 15-2 and 
12-2 earlier this season, me Tritons 
were surprised to find Sonoma State 
nipping at their heels, tying the game 
at three after goals from Lyman, 
Wong and Clevenger gave UCSD a 
3-1 lead early in the second period. 

"Sonoma State is better than a lot 
of people think, and in this case they 
were trying to be the Cinderellas." 
Sanders said. "It wasn't quite a 
'gimme' game, but we had to work 
for it until our defense stepped in 
and shut mem down," Sanders said.

to give UCSD a 5-3 lead at me 
break, but me Seawolves were there 
once more, pushing out another two 
goals to even up me game before 
Frazer's goal put me Tritons on top. 

Eventually, the UCSD defense took 
the game into its own hands, shut-
ting down me Seawolves for the rest 
of match while Lyman, Bajorek and 
senior two-meter Natalie Hockett 
each added a goal to advance UCSD 
to a 9-5 win.
