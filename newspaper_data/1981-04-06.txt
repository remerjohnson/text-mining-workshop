Th intimidating a peet of reporting a rape, the sub equent 

treatment and attitude about the nature of the crime and its 
victim, e pecially mi placed guilt of the victim, make the after 
effe t of rape a eriou a the crime it elf. 

Fortunately, at lea ·t in San 
Diego, offi ial attitud . have 
changed dra tically and for 
the better. 

Sgt. Larry Kenney of the 
San Diego Police Department 
Sex Crimes Divis ion says 
that his department handled 
420 rape ca e in 19 ,an 18 
percent increase over th 
197q statistics. 

"Of these case ," says 
Kenney, "we olved appro-
ximately 65 percent , which is 
well-above the national 
metropolitan police average 
of 36 percent. There is till 
more to be done, but we ort 
of have to pat our elves on 
the back for what we have 
been able to do." 

Kenney is quick to 
emphasize that rape is an act 
of humiliation, and that there 
exi ts no profile of a 'typical' 
rapist. 

"We ca n, ho weve r, 
separate most rapi ts in to 
four ba ic group .' 

"The fir tithe ociopath, 
who despise ociety and 
take it out on female

"The psyc hopath is 
usually also a misogynist, 
and finds rape the best and

ubjugating women. 
"The third i the burglar

course of ransacking a home 
may happen up on a female 
re ident. 

"The fourth, and by far the 
most common according to 
our best estimates, is the 
casual acquaintance, who 
will rape when the opportu· 
nity is present." 

Kenney say that there is 
no predicting where or when 
a rape is likely to occur. 
"Daylight rape are occuring 
with alarming frequency , 
and they occur where women 
are alone and vulnerable . 

"Rapi ts are like harks-

ay . "We know that college

One early morning last 

October, a woman wa out 
jogging near Warren campus. 
Suddenly a man grabbed her, 
dragged her into the bu hes, 
and forced her to orally 
copulate with him. 

"All I could think of while 
this man was attacking me," 
she said, "wa 'I hope I get 
out of this alive.'" 

Immediately following the 
savage attack, s he wa 
overcome with hock and 
confll . ion . '" really had 
second thoughts about telling 
anyone. I didn 't know if I 
wanted to relive it," he aid. 

Seven months after the 
attack this woman till

Fear: "It's frightening, it

three things: God, the Law 
(Torah) and nationalism. 
Anyone who attacks these is 
being anti- semitic . The

belief in God. and the ni is 
attacking our nationalism.

It becomes tiring to see 

anti-semitic articles in the ni 
under the guise of Palestini-
an rights. The Palestinians 
have rights, but using their 
rights to deny the Jews the 
basic right to a national 
homeland is being anti-
semitic. 

The late Rev. Martin 
Luther King acknowledged 
this when he said , "When 
people criticize Zionists, they 
mean Jews. You're talking 
anti-semitism. " King 
Hussein of Jordan did not 
differentiate between

Why is Jewish nationalism

The ni article speaks of the 
need for a Palestinian 
homeland. The Palestinian 
Arabs were given a homeland 
in 1947 when the United 
Nations voted to partition 
Palestine into {srael epld

Israel (20 percent of the land) 
and the Arabs received 
Jordan (SO percent of the

before 1921 , when the British 
established it in eastern 
Palestine as a prelude to an

about 70 percent Palestinian.

"What are you gonna do now that you 're out?" 
"What's up now?" 
"So what kind of job arc ya gonna get?" 
Is this boring you? I should hope so. It has bored 

the crap out of me for the last few months. You 
see. I am reaching that holy day called Graduation 
Day_ Not graduation from high school, mind you, 
but that real big day when 1 finish my stay at the 
university, the holy university where I have 
learned so much, most of which wasn't in the 
dassroom, . 

Now, you must understand that when you get 
out' of college people exPect you to- have your 
whole life planned out for the next 30 years. So if 
is. When you tell someooe that you are about to 
~aduate from college, the first thing they say is, 
So what are you going to do now?", or some 

variation thereof. 
What they don't seem to understand is that I 

have learned more than my major field of study 
and the skills it has required_ I ve learned about 
people and life and how this whole crazy mess is 
put together. [ may be an exception to the rule, as [ 
have noticed Quite a few comrades who ignored 

. this part of the college experience in pursuit of 
getting good grades, getti nga good job and getting 
laid by the right female. Many of those will go 
right to work for dad's firm or the FBI, or will go 
straight to the welfare line without passing go. 

Oh, I foegot to mention another favorite 
pastime of modem college students: drugs. All 
kinds. So many kinds that if their parents had any 
notion of what they were doing, they would have 
massive coronaries on the spot. Many pass 
through this stage and move on to creative 
endeavors, but we lament for those who never 
pull out of the artificial high nosedive. 

When you first s tart to approach the Big Day 

Rockwell was general manager al KSDT 

you take the Question as a challenge. Do I really 
know what I want to do? Of course I do! I want to 
be such and such ma.king so much a year and 
living in such a lifestyle. Basically, the person 
asking t he question wants some reassurance that 
t he college experience has been a good one for you 
and that you are now going togo out in society and 
be a good citizen. 

Unfortunately, this leaves out a major factor: 
. -the free will of the individual. What if I decide to 

do nothing? Oh shit, wouldn't that really .send 
them up? Anyway, when the Question first gets 
put ' to you, the response is yery casual and 
reserved. Then as time wears on and now it is , 

. every other person 'and then every person you 
meet who asks you the big question, you start to 
wonder if you believe the answer. Dol reallywant 
to do that? Am [really good enough to do that job? 
Would anybody hire me to do that job? 

. , 

For me, after about the 500th time I started 
having two sets of answers for people. Depending 
on who they were, I would answer either the 
straight career-minded option or the "I'm going to 
travel around the world and then move to 
Australia" type answer. Let me tell you it gets to 
be ridiculous. After the thousandth time 1 started 
telling everyone a different story. 

"Well, I got this great offertogoto England and 
become a punk rock star. You see I met this'guy 
and he said that his brother in New York could get 
me over t here and t hen his cousin in Liverpool has 
a friend who can set me up .. _."

station that won't drive me crazy with stupid

company back east that makes a new line of 
digital video games, and they want me to take

"I'm going to go to India and study under a guru 
for a few years and then come back and start my 
own school here in the States .... " 

"I'm going to flO pick mangos in Mexico .... " 
"I thought I'd,ust keep the part-time job I have 

now foe a few more years and then go back to 
school for another degree and then who knows 
what?...... , 

"I thought that I might go back into the jungles 
of Hawaii and just survive .... II 

After awhile people just stop listening to you 
and you can sa¥ anythinB you want. What I'd 
really like to do is tell peop1ewhat I'm not going to 
do with my college degree. I'm not going to start a 
war. I'm not going to aid in a war. I'm not going to 
punch people out for insulting my ego. I'm not 
going to marry someone just so I can be 
respectable <r so I won't have to be a bachelor 
anymore. I'm not going to give other people ulcers. 
I'm not going to rape the land that I live on. I'm not 
going to contribute to someone else's rape of the 
land. I'm not going to bring a child into this world 
unless it is deemed necessary by all parties 
contributing. I'm not going to sacrifice my well-· 
being for the desires of others upon me. I m not 
going to ~ to work because someone else wants 
me to. I m going to go to work because it is 
something I want to do. 

Basically we are what we are because that is 
what we created for ourselves. You and I create 
this world and so it is that we should do as we 
please. I'm off on that happy jaunt down the path 
of life, free of the bonds- Of coJleae. It is strange 
that it should seem so, but foe most that is what it . 
is. Bondage for four years and then freedom _ 
Many do not know what to make of that freedom_ 

If you should meet me on the road, do not ask 
me what t am going to do now. for it shall either be 
apparent already or we should not be talking at 
all. The future is as open as you make it, and by 
making too many plans too little will be 
accomplished.

Jordan waged a bloody civil 
war, and threw out many of 
the Palestinians. Where is 
t he outcry for these 
Palestinians' rights? 

Avoidance of the Jordan 
question was just one of the 
many deficiencies in the 
article. It also alleged t hat the 
early Jewish settlers bought 
land from absentee landlords 
who sold it out from under its 
inhabitants. Most of the land 
purchased by t he early 
Zionists was empty swamp-
land. 

As the British Peel report 
s howed, "Much of the land 
now carrying orange groves 
was sand dunes or swamp 
and uncultivated when it was 
purchased." The 1937 
Palestine Royal Commission 
Report shows only 688 
tenants displaced by land 
purchases. They were offered 
other land as compensation. 
These were not ancestral 
lands. The British Director of 
Development declared in 
1931 that , "Large areas of 

their lands were uncultivated 
and covered with weeds. 
There were no trees, no 
vegetables. The fellahin, if 
not themselves cattle thieves, 
were always ready to 
harbour these and other 
criminals ... 

Early 20th century 
Palestine was badly under-
populated; it held a small 
fraction of the people that it 
had held during Roman times 
(about 350,000 vs. about 
three million). Furthermore, 
this p<llulation has always 
included Jews. The 1875 
Turkish census shows that 
Jews were a majority in 
Jerusalem. 

According to the ni article, 
the PLO is the only 
organization to represent the 
Palestinians. In 1938, the 
Nazis were the only group to 
represent the Germans. Both 
are fascist groups which 
eliminate dissenters. For 
example, of the apparoxi· 
mately 140 Palestinian 
moderates w ho went to 
EgypttonegotiatewithI rael 
after Camp David, 0 far 42 

have been murdered by the 
PLO. 

The article also ass rts 
that terrorism is an 
acceptable strategy. Possibly, 
but shouldn' t it be used only 
after all peaceful means have 
been tried and (ailed, if at alI? 
The PLO is'dedicated to 
violence. Article 9 of its 
charter states, "Armed 
struggle is the only way to 
liberate Palestine and is 
therefore a strategy and not a 
tact1c." Does this indicate a 
desire for peace? 

The article states, "We 
answer that the PLO does not 
suggest that the Jews cannot 
live in Palestine." The PLO 
covenant specifically states 
that only Palestinian Arabs 
possess the legal right to 
Palestine. Only Jews who 
resided in the area "before 
the beginning of the Zionist 
invasion" are to be 
con s idered Palestinians . 
Others are not given any 
rights to the land . An organ of 
EI -Fatah, the principal 
component of the PLO, was

SD police have progressive 
attitude toward rape victint 
yet it could happen 
anywhere." 

Kenney has noted over the 
years that there has been an 
escalation in sodomy and oral 
copulation. "Apparently, 
with t he slow liberation of 
women from their traditional 
sex role, the rapists feel that 
normal forced intercourse 
doesn't sufficiently degrade 
and humiliate the women," 
he says. 

The police department 
attitude towards treatment 
of the rape victim is 
progressive. "We work 
closely with the Rape 
Emergency Assi tance League 
(REAL) and the Center for 
Womens' Studies and 
Services," he said . 

Both organizations 
maintain 24-hour rape 
hotlines in the San Diego 
County area. "We have had 
good success with these 
organizations. If the victim 
decides to report the incident, 
REAL will sent a counselor 
with the woman who will 
stay by her side during the 
police inv~stigation, will go 
wjth her (0 the h pital and 
even to court if the case is 
solved and tried. 

"Unfortunately," Kenney 
added, "the courtroom is still 
very male·dominated, which 
can be very intimidating to a 
woman, so having a REAL 
counselor along can be 
extremely comforting and 
supportative." 

San Diego Police Depart-
ment policy is not to press the 
victim to prosecute if she is 
unwilling to do so. An 
exception to this is in the 
instance where the same 
suspect is char~ed with 
multiple rapes. 'There is 
strength in unity," Kenney 
says_ 

Sex Crimes officers receive 
special training in rape 
investigatil)n at San Jose 
State University, including 
all aspects of caring and 
comforting the victim. In 
addition, over half of the 
investigators have received 
supplemental training at the 
FBI Academy. 

On a disconsolate note, 
Kenney warns that there is 
no single course of action 
suggested by the police in the 
event that a woman is 
victimized. "It's entirely an 
individual situation, and you 
never can predict how the 
rapist will respond. The 
mentally -unbalanced are 
going to continue the attack 
no matter what. Resistance 
turns ome rapists on, some 
off. The best defense against 
rape is awareness," he said . 

"Be aware walking to and 
from place , and watch for 
people following you. Carry 
tear gas, but condition 
yours elf to carry it in hand 
and use it immwialdy if 
attacked , because it isn't 
going to do you any good if it ' . 
in vour pur, e. 

"Rape whistles and horns, 
screaming and hollering, 
scratching and kicking, all of 
these could be effective, but 
in the final analysis the 
woman must use her best 
judgment."

Stegner, poet, naturalist speaks 
Third_ Belkin lecture; scheduled for Apr il 23 

Wallace Stegner will speak April 23 in T LH 107. 

Wallace Stegner, Pulitzer Prize-winning 
novel ist , conservationis t and western 
historian who started writing in the mid· 
1930 , will give the third annual David ~arc 
Belkin Memorial Lecture Thursday, Apn123, 
at UCSD. 

The lecture, which is free and open, will 
begin at 8 pm in TLH 107. 

The Belkin Lectures on environmental 
issues were established by the parents and 
friends of David Marc Belkin, an honors 
graduate of John Muir College at UCSD. 
Belkin lost his life while backpacking in the 
High Sierra in July 1978. 

Stegner occupies a unique position in 
ant mporary American I tters . H ha won a 

large and devoted following for his novels but 
he i equally well-known for his perceptive 
historical studies and as the author of 
numerous critical studies. 

In addition, he established and headed, for 
26 years, the Stanford University Writing 
Program which he developed into one of 
America's most important and prestigious 
training grounds for new writers. 

He is the author of 15 fiction and nonfiction 
novel and collected short fiction including 
Remembering LAughter, which was pubished 
in 1937 and which won the Little, Brown 
novelette prize. The Big Rock Candy 
Mountain, Stegner's great family novel, was 
published in 1943 while he was teaching in the 
Harvard University creative writing program. 

He left Harvard in 1944 to help Look 
Magazine research a wartime series on racial 
and religious intolerance. One year later he 
accepted a posi.tion as profess,?r at S.tanford 
University. WhIle at Stanford hiS publications 
included Second Growth, The Preacher and the 
Slave, The Writer in America, Beyond the 
Hundredth MerilJian, All the Litile Live 
Things, and The Sound of Mountain Water. 

In 1972, Angel of Repose, a study of the life 
and letters of Mary Halleck Foote, a writer and 
illustrator who followed her mining-engineer 
husband west from New York in the 18705, 
won a Pulitzer Prize. Four years laler an 
adaptation of A1rgel 0/ Repose was et to music 
and given a world premiere as .the 
Bicentennial production of the San FranCISCo 
Opera. That same year Stegner pu blished The 
Spectator Bird, winner of the National Book 
Award for Fiction. 

In 1979, at the age of 70, he published his 
12th novel, Recapitulation. His newest book, 
Americml Places , a nonfiction look at the 
country's past and present written with his 
son, Page, is scheduled to be published next 
fall . 

Jame Houston, in an interview with 
Stegner, called him "a regional writer in the 
richest sense of that word, one who manages 
to dig through surface and plumb a region's 
deepest implications, tapping into profound 
matters of how a place or a piece of territory 
can shape life, character, actions, dreams. 

"In all of his books, fiction or nonfiction," 
aid Houston, "the sense of place is essential 

to an understanding of the life." 
The Belkin Memorial Lecture series, which 

began in 1979, brings to the UCSD campus 
each spring a speaker distinguished for his or 
her work in the appreciation and preservation 
of the wilderne s. 

Pa t speaker include Peter Matthiessen, 
author of The S,IOW Leopard, and the National 
Book Award winner for 1979, and David 
Brower, founder and head of The Friends of 
the Earth. 

The first three lectures, by Matt hiessen , 
Brower and Stegner, will be published in a 
single volume by the University of California 
press, according to the Public Information 
Office.

Victim of acquaintance-rape

coatinued from pate 4 

"There are lots of ways in 
which women are socialized 
that make it very difficult for 
them to be sexually assertive. 

"It does not surprise me 
that these rapes do occur; 
that they're not defined as 
rapes by the woman; and that 
even if they are, the woman 
doesn't believe that anyone 
will believe her; or that she 
feels so ashamed and so 
oonfused about the event 
itself that she does not want 
to talk about it. 

"In order for a woman to 
talk about an acquaintance-
rape, a woman may be asked 
to identify herself publicly as 
8 sexual penon. And the 
double standard is still alive 
and well in this society. 

"And a lot of people won't 
believe her," she says, and 
the woman will be countered 
by a 'you·asked-for-it' type of 
attitude: "'What were you 
doing in that guy's 
apartment? What did you 
think he would do when you 
were studying in his 
bedroom?'" 

Levens says that even 
women who are assaulted 
and raped.by a st.r~ often 
decide not to report It. "Let's 
say the woman was using 
drugs, that she was drunk or 
stoned; she says to herself, 
'Well, I shouldn't have been 
there: and so she takes on the 
responsibility. " 

But women should 
certainly report these cases, 
she says . "Obviously, 
whoever this person is that's 
doing this is likely to do this 
to other women. " 

Levens says she also 
frequently deals with 
students who have been 
victims of incest. "For many 
women, college is the first 
time they can get away, and 
they may . have a younger 
sister at home who may be 
the one who gets molested . 

"Rape education should 
not be just for women," she 
says. "Appallingly large 
numbers of people are raped 
and molested in their 
lifetime, and it isn't only 
women who are affected, 
because men are husbands, 
lovers, brothers. father and 
sons."

BY BOB McSPADDEN

An estimated 25,000 
spectators flocked to the 
shores of Mission Bay 
Saturday to watch UCSD 
and 40 other teams compete 
in the annual San Diego 
Crew Classic. 

Not a ripple broke the 
water as the teams gathered 
for the 7 am start, and when 
all 35 events had been .

In the finals of the same

With their performance, 
UCSD's women's crt:w 
moved one step closer to the 
women's intercollegiate 
finals to be held at the 
beginning of May. Coach 
Vallerga was openly proud: 
"The crew held together and 
kept pulling in the end when 
they needed to. They're a fine 
bunch and they did a very 
good job." 

Vallerga was also optimis-
tic about the men's 
performance. " We took 
second in the first heat of the 
lightweight eight (only 1.1 
seconds behind Navy) and did 
very well in the finals. I don't 
feel outclassed at all," he 
said. 

The Tritons' impressive 
rowing put them into the 
finals in four of the five 
events entered. Although the 
sky was crystal clear and the 
water glassy for the start of 
this year's regatta, the wind 
kicked up and became a 
factor mid-way through the 
Classic. 

The three local host 
schools, UCSD. USD and 
SDSU, fared very well in the 
over-all competition. SDSU 
edged out crosstown 
opponent USD in the Cal Cup 
8, pressured by third place 
Long Beach State. SDSU also 
took a second place in the 
women's novice eight, just 
behind a very powerful Cal 
crew. 

At tines it looked like it might 
cost them their jobs, their. reputations, 

and maybe even their ives.

Men get 
eigth 
in NCAA 
Swimmers 
rank high 

BY JIM AGRONIK 
Senior Staff Writer 

Swimming for the first 
time in the NCAA Division III 
Nationals in Oberlin, Ohio, 
the UCSD men's team burst 
onto the scene with an 
outstanding eighth place 
finish overall. According to 
Coach Bill Morgan, the 
competition was stiff, but the 
UCSD team rose to the 
occasion and established its 
name among the 69 
universities in attendanct!. 

UCSD sent a team of 13 
swimmers to the competi· 
tion, and eight individuals 
returned with All American 
honors, including seniors Joe 
Hernandez and Steve Best, 
junior John Beckley, 
sophomores Tracy Strahl 
and Bob Conlin, and 
freshmen Dave Reed, Doug 
Lee and Greg Doyas. 

With his most recent All 
American ranking, Hernan· 
dez became the first UCSD 
swimmer to receive All 
American honors for all four 
college years. Competing in 
the nerve-wracking 100 free, 
an event where tenths of a 
second are crucial, Hernan· 
dez clocked a 47.56 to finish 
ninth in the event. 

Strahl, an outstanding 
backstroker competing in his 
first year for UCSD, broke 
school records in both the 100 
and 200 backstroke. With 
times of 54.54 and 1:58.15 
respectively, Strahl earned a 
9th and 11th place in these 
events. 

Freshman -Dave Reed 
shattered school records in 
both the 100 and 200 
breastrokes with times of 
1:00.87 and 2:10.59 respec· 
tively. Reed's 100 breast 
performance placed him 
17th, not good enough for All 
American. 

Swimming with a com· 
manding lead in the 200 
breast, Reed easily won the 
consolation heat. His 7th 
place finish was the best 
Triton individual effort. 

In the relays, an eager 
UCSD team demolished 
school records and placed all 
relays among the top 12 
teams. 

The best relay finish was a 
fourth place effort in the 800 
free relay. Relay swimmers 
Conlin, Hernandez, Doyas 
and Lee completed this event 
in a time of 7:01.19 and gave 
UCSD a strong boost in 
national points. 

The 400 medley relay of 
Strahl, Best, Reed and 
Hernandez followed suit by 
chopping five seconds off the 
previous school record for a 
3:35.8 and an eighth place 
finish. 

Finally, the 400 free relay 
of Beckley, Hernandez, Lee 
and Reed clocked a 3:11.66 in 
the prelims but dropped from 
ninth place in the prelims to 
12th place in the finalswitha 
finishing time of 3:12.99. 

Other school records fell in 
the 1650 free and the 200 fly. 
Conlin snatched the 1650 free 
record (now at 16:39.62) ftom 
teammate Lance Halsted and

W otnen netters split 
tnatches over 'Weekend 

BY SAMANTHA ROBY 
Staff Writer 

Coming off of a 6·3 defeat of 
league rival Westmont last 
Wednesday, the UCSD 
women's tennis team 
trounced Point Lorna College 
9 -0 Friday to remain 
undefeated in four league 
contests. 

The Tritons now occupy 
the top rung of their league's 
ladder with an overall record 
of 9-5. 

Chalking up the six 
victories OYl!r Westmont 
were first seed Cecilia 
Kavinaugh (6·3, 6-0); third 
seed Lisa Gilbert (6·1, 6·2); 
fourth seed Elisabeth Saar (6-
4, 7·6); fifth seed Karen Baar 
(6-1, 6·2); first seed doubles 
Kavinaugh/ Saavedra (6·2, 6· 
4) and second seed doubles 
Gilbert/Saar (6·2, 6·4). 

UCSD put Point Lorna 
away handily, as seen in the 
first seed match between 
UCSD's Cecilia Kavinaugh 
and Point Lorna 's Sue 

Hughey. Hughey proved no 
contest for Kavinaugh from 
the start of the match. 

Kavinaugh took care of her 
opponent with consistent 
play and well· placed shots. 
One of the strategies that 
proved most effective for 
Kavinaugh was her hart 
topspin shot, which Hughey 
failed to return throughout 
the contest. It was apparent 
that Hughey made little 
effort to return Kavinaugh's 
good shots. Kavinaugh's 
consistent play forced 
Hughey to return either long, 
wide or into the net. 

Because of the great 
difference between the two 
players, the match proved to 
be unspectacular , and 
Kavinaugh went on to take 
an easy victory 6·1, 6·0. 

Coach Liz ' Dudash was 
confident going into the 
match that it would be a 
fairly ea y contest. "We 
really just u ed it as a tune· 

up for Occidental on 
Saturday." 

Against Occidental UCSD 
did not control the match as 
they did against Point Lorna. 
Occidental dealt the Tritons 
a 7·2 lOss, but Dudash saw 
definite improvement over 
lhe la ,t time they faced Oxy 
and lost 8·1. 

The Tritons will be hosting 
the All Cal tournament next 
weekend. Three University 
of California schools -
Berkeley. Los Angeles and 
Santa Barbara - will not be 
sending teams due to 
scheduling conflicts. Dudash 
feels that ifthe Tritons give it 
their best shot, they ought to 
come in third place behind 
reigning Division III national 
champ Davis and Division I 
team Irvine. Tournament 
play begins at 8 am each day. 

This week 
in sports 

SwiflltnerS shine at NCAA nationals 
continued from page 12 
also swam best times in the 200 and 500 frees. 

Junior Mike Gautreau broke the 200 fly record with a best 
time of 1 :59.33. 

Graduating this quarter is senior Lance Halsted who barely 
missed the top 12 in both the 500 and 1650 frees. Halsted has 
been a key member of the team for the past four years, 
especially in the distance events. and graduates with three 
previous All American titles. 

Also graduating is senior Steve Best whose personal best 
times in the 100 and 200 breastrokes (1:01.15 and 2:13.95) 
should not be overshadowed by teammate Reed 's 

performance. 
Senior Don Edgar and freshmen Marshall Platt and Rich 

Peterson all had good efforts in this highly competitive meet , 
but their early taper to meet qualifying standards hindered 
their ability to place in their respective events. 

Following the national , the team wa able to fl y, at no 
extra charge, to the Virgin Islands where they pent a week 
recovering from the stress of national competition. 

In summing up UCSD's performance a very satisfied Coach 
Morgan said, "We did great! I think it was a great experience, 
and I learned a lot a a coach. Theguys are really fired up now 
and I think we'll have a good ea on next year."

and fails, to do for the world 
of the theatre. The film lacks 
any interest in its characters, 
it's about as gripping a a 
Hogan's Heroes episode. In 
fact, Truffaut might have 
been better advised to have 
done the whole thing as a 
light comedy, ala Lubitsch 's 
Tn Rp Or Not To Be, then 
there might have been some 
spark to this movie. As it is, 
when it tries to be biting, it 

rev~ls only a tired set of 
gums. 

Palestine 
continued from Daile 3 
more explicit: "The aim of 
the war is not to impose our 
will on the enemy but to 
exterminate him in order to 
replace him," 

In a speech to the UN, 
Yassir Arafat dated the 

beginnin~ of "the Jewish 
invasion' to 1881. Only the 
Jews who arrived in Palestine 
before 1881 are given any 
rights. Yet the PLO charter 
gives Palestinian status to 
the considerable numbers of 
Arabs who migrated to 
Palestine until 1947. Why isa 
double standard used? In any 
case, the PLO would deny the 
rights of the holocause 
refugees and t he more than 
700,000 Jewish refugees from 
Arab lands (if descendants 
are counted, as with the 
Palestinians, the total swells 
to more than 1.4 million). All 
of these people have no pJace 
else to go. 

A Pale tin ian writer, Nasir 
ad-Din an ashibi , put t hi 
desire to expel the Jews more 
graphically. His book , RelurIl 
Ticket, ay , "I want to wash 
away the disa ter of 1948 
with the blood of those who 
prevent them from entering 
their-land . Their homeland is 
dear to them, but revenge )s 
dearer. We'll enter their lairs 
in Tel Aviv. We'll ' mash Tel 
Aviv with axes, guns, hands, 
fingernails , and ~ teeth .... " 
The other Atab countries 
agree with this strat~. A 
United Arab Repu blic 
schoolbook reads, "The Jews 
are wicked Criminals who 
came to Palestine .... We will 
drive the wicked criminals 
out of the country."

The third solution, the idea 
of separate Arab and Jew' 
states, seems to be the 0. 
realist it solution. However, 
the article is unfair to the

Would you like to see any 
additional service that do 
not already exist at the 
Health Center? 

If yes, What? 
In addition to the nurse 

that is currently employed, 
do you think it is nece sary to 
have an on-call twenty-
iour(24) hour doctor to 
respond to medical calls? 

Palestine 
continued from page 14 
struggle against any plan for 
the establishment of a 
Palestinian entity, the price 
of which is r~ition (of 
Israel), conciliatIOn (with 
Israel), secure borders .... " 
The other Arab nations 
(except Egypt) agree, Iraqi ex-
p'!:esident Arif has declared. 
'Our goal is to wipe Israel off 

the map." 
To conclude, I would liketo 

say that I personally resent 
this continuing anti-semitic 
attack, Israel is not perfect. 
but compared with the other 
assorted fascist, totalitarian 
and dictatorial r~imes in the 
region, democratIc Israel is 
indeed "a light unto the 
nations, "

"San Diego's Most within walking distance of UCSD 

U . Store" 

Here's what accreditation team leader John Milton said about UCSD during 
his last visit: 

That hath thy a.ft, 
By mixing somewhat true to vent more lies. 

But what hath been thy answers, what but clark, 
Ambiguous, and with double sense deludlngl* 

But Milton also said that students can be a part of 
taki ng the University from those who are content 
to let it rest as a human overflow lot for Berkeley 

or a Valley vacation home. 
Write for The Guardian and expose the selfish 

and the greedy. 
And, there's room for those who want to write 
about good things peculiar to UCSD - students 
who graduate in 2 years, professors on the edge 
of discovery, and people allover the campus 
who take seriously their commitment to 

improving the quality of life and education. 

Call Jeff . Beresford-Howe at The Guardian 
(452-3466), or stop by the office if you want to 
shake things up, make (a little) money, or just be 
noticed and loved by parents, friends and 
prospective employers. We're in the building 
with Che Cafe, amidst the eucalyptus trees 
southeast of the Revelle Provost's Office ... see you 

soon!
