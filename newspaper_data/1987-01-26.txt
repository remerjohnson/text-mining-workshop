USB Chancellor 
denounces date rape 

UC Berkeley Chancellor Ira 
Michael Heyman issued a trong 
denunciation of "date rape" in a 
letter mailed 10 31 ,000 students 
in response 10 growing concern 
over sexual assaults on the 
campu . 

Heyman wrote that 
acquaintance rape "degrades its 
viCtims, our campus commumty 
and society at large." The letter 
was acompamed by brochure 
defining acquaintance rape as 
"sexual intercourse undertaken 
by a friend or acquamtan e 
without the consent of the 
woman." The procedure also 
recommends ways 10 avoid 
situations that might lead to 
rape. 

The packet came after a 
number of faculty expressed their 
dislike of the handling of a case 
which involved the alleged 'rape 
of an 18 year-old female Berkeley 
student by four members of the 
football team late last September. 
Campus police said that II 
rapes were reponed in 1986, 
double the previous year's 
figures.

UCSA subntits 
elllployntent policy 
By RENEE ALLISON, UC Davis 

The University of California Student Association announced last 
week that it has submitted its own student employment poltcy to 
the systemwid e admini strati on for im plementation and 
recommendation to the UC Council of Chancellors. 

"We've come up with what we consider to be an entirely 
reasonable report ," said UCSA President Michael Berry. 

The systemwide administration agreed to supply us with certain 
mformation , said Berry, and in return we agreed to provide various 
alterna tives to the current interim wage policy. 

Berry said that the report has been submitted to UC Associate 
Vice President for Employee Relations Richard Catalano, who he 
said has agreed to meet with him , UCSA Vice President of 
Employee Relations, leena Walker and uCSACollective Marketing 
Coordinator Dale Bankhead to discuss the proposal next week. 

The UCSA proposal calls for the creation of the Chancellor's 
Advisory Committee on each campus to promote a mandatory 
consultative process. 

The suggested composition of the committee is three to five 
university managers responsible for student employment and three 
to five student representatives appOinted by student government 
and /or existing student employee organizations, one faculty 
member, and one student affairs administrator. 

In addit ion, the proposal reads that "all changes to student 
employme nt policy shall be reviewed by this consultative body 
prior to implementation ." 

The proposal also states that there will be no wage CutS "without 
prior demonstrated financial neceSSity on the part of the 
university," and that "there shall be no two-tiered wage system" 
meaning that "new employees shall be compensated on the basis of 
the same pay rate as incumbent or ongOing employees." 

In terms of salary surveys and wage comparisons, the proposal 
states that all salaries should be based on detailed job deSCriptions 
derived by on-site job audits , and that "salaries surveyed shall 
include a pay raise for comparable positions at other UC campuses, 
private universities, public and non-profit agencies and private 
sector employers as deemed appropriate by the consultative body." 

Another highlight of the proposal includes the establishment of a 
student-consumer price index, which will be used to develop a 
minimum wage for student employees. 

In addition, the proposal states that "minimum pay rates should 
enable students to meet 35 percent of the student-consumer price 
mdex costs , housing, feed, medical , personal , manadaLOry fees , 
books and supplies, transportation and miscellaneous by working 
14 hours per week. 

The proposal also calls for a comprehension classifica tion study 
of the Assistant Series on each campus, uniformity of policy 
procedures with respect to longevity and merit pay and th e 
observance of equal opportunity and affirmati ve action policies in 
the hiring of student employees. 

Until a new systemwide wage policy is adopted, Berry said that 
the moratorium on current stud ent wage cuts will remain in 
effect. [i;J

Affinnative Action resolution proposed 
By MARC] KLEIN ~t(/U \\'''/('1 

U NIVERSIll' of ,Mo rnI a President D,wld Gardner said In an Interview with 
TIle San Diego Union that it migh t be 
time to reconSider a 1974 
resoluti on from the five year 
Student Affirmative Ac tion Plan. 
If it is ca rried Out , some Asian-
Americans think that it will 
encourge discrimination aga inst 
them. 

"If the affirmative ac tion 
resolution is followed to the 
letter, it could lead to a quota 
system that would reduce the 
proportion of Asian-American 
students admined to the UC 
system ," Lin Chi Wang, 
Assoc iated Professor of Ethnk 

tudies at UC Berkeley said . 
The resolution Gardner spoke 

about was origi nally drafted to 
bring under represented groups 
o f students into the UC system 
to create a diverse and "color 
blind" campus society. The goal 
of the policy was fo r UC 
enrollment to mirror the 
percentage of minority groups 
that graduated from California 
high sc hools. 

Nick Aguilar, Director of 
Undergraduate Affairs /Special 
Services said that the policy was 
designed to set minimum "goals" 
for approaching parity in the 
University system, "not ceilings," 
for under represented groups. 
However, he explained that there 
is a "potential in the policy for 
limiting enrollment, but that is 
not the intention." 

Asian-American students in 

college have surpas~ed their 
numbers enrolled in high school. 
The AlTirmative A tlon program 
worked so well that Aslan-
Amencan stud ents no longer 
need to be recrui ted through the 
program. The California high 
sc hool graduating class comprises 
six percent Asian-American 
students where the UC system 
has 20-25 percent Asian-
American enrollment. Gardner 
defined this as an "ove r 
representation" of Asian-
American students. 

Gardner said the particular 
resolution that was being 
reconsidered calls "for enrollment 
to more accurately reflect the 
state's population." Deni se Miura. 
Executive Intern of Internal 
Affairs for the Student Affirmative 
Action Committee (SAAC), thinks 
that the policy which was once 
used to bring in minority groups 
will be used to limit the number 
of Asian-American students 
admi tted into the UC system. "If 
the resolution is reinforced to 
more accurately reflect the state's 
population , then up to 19 
percent of Asian-American 
students could be cut from 
admissions." , 

Further, Miura believes "the 
confusion with the policy is that 
it doesn't say what to do once its 
goals are met." Miura does not 
think the program should be 
used as a means to limit Asian-
American enrollment. 

Shoon Lio, Chairman of the 
Rights for Asian Pacific Student 
Alliance (APSA) said, "i Gardner's 

vlewj IS ,\ \ l't)' narrow 
mterpretatlon of Affirmative 
Action . The original concept ion 
of the Afftnnativc Action 
Resolution was to bnng pel1ple 
10 . 0\\ there's a blur in the 
distinction between goals which 
bri ng people in , and goals which 
are being used to keep people 
out." 

Dr. Joseph Watson , Vice 
Chancell or of Undergradua te 
Affairs, stated "1 see no problem 
with the resolution, particularly if 
one focuses on the tOpic of 
under representation The 

p roblem I S that the wrong Issues 
are be ing discussed . Thc 
problcm is not over 
representatIOn , the problcm is 
that there are not enough spaces 
for all the qualIfIed students , and 
there is an under representation 
of certam group " One possible 
resolution to the problem 
Watson said would be to provide 
more slots for all students. 
Watson emphasizes under 
representation whereas .Gardner 
focuses on over representation . 

Should th e Affirmative Action 
resolution be "followed to the 

lette r," It is pOSSible It could lead 
to an tn\~s lble quota system that 
would penalize a mmonty group 
for hemg tOO successful. Gardner 
said that the state IS uffenng 
from an "embarrassment of 
successes" and that the efforts 
made to "redress earlier ethnic 
imbalances are bemg Jeoparcitzed 
by new and unexpected 
Imbalances." Gardner also stated 
that any action taken "must be 
done without punishing the 
Asians or any other students 
which could result in 
undersirable ethnt tensions." [i;J 

Faculty Club goes underway 
By JOHN SHAW Smior Staff WnUr 

STUDENT parking and a large ponion of the lawn between Peterson Hall 
and the Sun God gave way to 
recent construc tion of a new 
$2.8 million Faculty/ Community 
Club. 

Groundbreaking ceremonies 
took place last Friday celebrating 
the birth of the project that was 
twO years In th e making. 

The club will function as a 
community center for "faculty, 
staff and local companies 
involved in research for UCSD," 
according to Stanley Chodorow, 
Associate Vice C hancellor of 
Academic Planning and Dean of 
Arts and Humanities. 

The one-story 15,000 square 
foot facility is expected 10 be 
named in honor of Ida M. and 

Cecil H. Green, founder of Texas 
Instruments, who donated $1 
mIllion to the project. Other local 
individuals and finanCial 
instinlt ions donated funds as 
well . UCSD faculty and staff 
members contributed $418.000. 

The club will have several 
dining rooms plus six mceting 
rooms and a lounge. The main 
dining room will accomodate 
175 people with additional 
seating for 100 on a dintng 
terrace. Because the club will 
serve alcoholic beverages, a food 
contract must be secured with a 
private ope ra tor, according to 
Chodorow. 

Members of the club will be 
required to pay an initiation fee 
and monthly dues to be used for

upkeep and operating expenses. 
Chodorow said that "nearly all 
institutions have faculty centers," 
and that the fees and dues of 
this facility will be competitive 
with other clubs around the 
nation . Chodorow expects the 
initiation fees to be 
approXimately $100-'ii300 and 
monthly dues to bc between $10-
SIS . 

Chodorow esti mates 
approximately 1,000 members will 
join , primanly "higher education" 
faculty and staff which would 
include vice chancellors , deans, 
department chairs and professors. 

The copper roofed club is 
expected to be completed by late 
1987. No student fees were used

Fair planning, please 
. There are a lot of things at thi umversity that are valuable to 

different people , ome thmgs are built With a solitary purposc. 
The Medical chool was built to selVe ItS students and patlcnts. 
The uper Computer was built for the EEC depanment and 
the Depanment of Defe n e, The parkmg areas, of course. were 
desl~ned In uch a wa )' that no administrator would be 
reqUired to walk more than 50 feet to his or her destmation. 
The seemingly ecology-conscious layout of the areas was. unul a 
couple of years ago, valuable to everyone wh o entered , 
10 luding the admimstratlon 

Today, one is met 'with bulldozers and wrecked butld ings 
when entering the campus. ew microbiology labs and 
earthquake research fa limes have replaced the euca lyptus 
groves and grassy areas at this sc hool.Although construction IS 
often welcomed In a growing cOmmUnH}' su h a UCSD, the 
new facilille and their deSign and cOnStrucllon are undeSi rable 
for many reasons. Unlike prevIOus projects , the new bUildings 
are unSightly concrete Stru tures, apparently constru ted wllh 
inexpensll'e construction as a primary design factor. The 
architects who deSIgned previous campus layouts seemed more 
conscious of the beauty of buildings integrated with their 
surroundings. Even the buildings which dIdn 't Integrate with 
the woods, su h as Central Libra!y or MUIr Campus. were of an 
Original and mteresting design 

As usual , the current projects are obli110us to the needs of 
the grolving undergraduate population The neWest addltlon to 
the campus are graduate research facilHl es with a "fa culty Club" 
due soon. The Faculty Club w1l1 0 eupy the eaStern half of the 
Peterson Hall parking lot, the same parl that was coincldentaUy 
rezoned as the only remalnmg student parking In the area. 

Contrary to admmlstratlon lalms. the universlry ha 
constantly aVOIded the ecologl al issue, Student groups have 
consistently shown heI r apprecia tion of the wooded groves 
and open , unadultera ted spaces People who often enjoyed 
studying or si mply relaXing near the Sun God will be surprised

God goes to school 
By JAN CHRISTIAN 

I N my ~vo years at UCSD, [ have noted an Increasing trend among students 
(mysrl f Included) to learn by 
accepting all that is said in 
lecture as rcalit}' Unawareness 
by profes or as to how the y .Ire 
reaU}' presenting matenal , and 
unawareness by the students as 
to the personal role that the 
professors play 10 setting the 
course contribute to this 
problem. 

Ed u atlon and intellcC! 
emph.lslze learning how to think 
and evaluate concepts 
mdependently. Students are 
exposed to more Ideas and 
theories in college than at any 
other pOint 10 their educatlon. 
Ironi ally, however, In the 
univerSi ty setting it is easy for 
Students to accept a professor's 
leCTUres as absolute truth, thus 
closing the mind to other 
theories and defeating the 
primary goal of edu ation , 

The professor's obligation to 
ms truCt docs not stop at the 
preSentallon of ideas but at the 
prese I1tallon of how to evaluate 
those Ideas The acceptance of a 
theory can be mampulated 
greatly by side comments and 
trivia1!zation It is important that 
professors teach objectively. for 
in doing so they provide an 
arena for students to questlon 
and [0 give answers back to 
themselves There b a need to 
shol\' the legltlma!e dmwbacb 01 
d the:ory. but as pi! n 01 
inte llectual growth , stua ents 
hould hJve to decld .. for 

them elves wh at 15 right and 
wrong. 

As students we have an 
ob ligation to think Jbnu! what 
we arc be ing e:\p ~ed to and to 
que stion actil'ely rJther than 
learn pasSIve!) 

ReligIOn IS a good example of 
a bias that IS presented in 
spe ioc lectures which 
ontributes to the c10semindness 

of students. While realiZing that 
it has been a tremendous social 
force th roughout hIstory. 
professors have often trivialized 
and inaccurately portrayed the 
beliefs of Christianity. A 
philosophy professor in a lower 
diviSIOn lecture used Chri tian 
beliefs as an example of a fallacy, 
stating "obviously, someone is 
not saved from an airplane crash 
because he prayed ." However, 
while this may be the personal 
belief of the professor, it is not 
an objecrive example of the 
concept she was defi ning. 

Prejudice in regard to religion 
is a natural problem in socie ty , 
Throughout history, people have 
struggled with the questions of 
creation, th e existence of God , 
and what type of God He is. I 
would Ve nture to say that to exist 
without ever making an actual 
deciSIOn about God creates 
personal misunderstanding and 
sometimes an animosity IOwards 
those who do make a decision. A 
professor's position on this 
question is made on a very 
personal level; however, they do 
have an obligation 10 teach the 
forces of SOCiety with respects to 
their validiry, regardless of their 
personal beliefs 

Although religIOns are most 
oftcn ponrayed as irrational in 
the univerSity setting, as 
Inte e lUals - professors and 
studcnts - we need to realize 
that all beliefs require a step of 
faith , Hence, sCience is no more 
"rational" than religion, JUSt as 
creation reqUires a decision of 
belief, so 100 does the "big bang" 
theory; careful examinau nand 
logic must be applied to both. 

There is an obligation among 
professors and students 10 treat 
religion wi th the same respect as 
any other rational belief system , 
just as they do Marxist theories 
and Freudian theories. 

The major issue here IS 
awareness - awareness of 
different beliefs and awareness 
that we should think about them , 
Discussion is one of the most 
effective means by whi h 
students can work through their 
thoughts. Panels of students and 
faculty, 10 which we could 
exchange ideas more equally, 
would help to foster new ideas. 
To meet with smaller more 
informal arrangements and ask 
questions gai ning new insights 
into the material would be 
be neficia l 10 both groups, 

This is added work for 
professors and students alike. 
However, it would be worth the 
trouble of organization. Most 
professors that I have had 
contact with want to learn as 
:hey teach their students. By 
getting feedback and learning the 
thoughts of their students, they 
can widen their own 
perspectives. In addition, 
students could see the more 
personal side to the professor's 
methods, and through discussion 
would fonn and clarify thoughts 
on the issues. 

To learn, we cannot just 
a cept what is being said. If I\'e 
do we are basically being 
molded I do not consider It [he 
malicious intent of the professors 
to shape us into their own 
image, but that I, the natural 
result from not questioning \i\\' 
have imel!ectual minds that 
should not be closed by our 
professors or by ourselves, for It 
is only y searching that we can 
find the truth . ~

Subject A semi-defended 
Editor. 

The January 8 issue of the 
Glwrdlan presented a front page 
story on the Subject A writing 
program and included an 
editorial, "Subject A Flunks OUt," 
by Michael Krekorian. The whole 
campus was exposed to only a 
partial and inaccurate view of 
the program (especially its 
teachers) and I fee l It necessary 
to fill in the gaps. Yes, Subject A 

has its problems - lots of them 
- but the sources of those 

problem~ are not, as the author 
of the ar icles and Michael 
Krekoria1 Implied , the Mesa 
College laculty. 

[ have taught in this program 
since September 1985. from the 
stan U<...SD and Mesa , who co-ope~ted on the program's 
development, disagreed on the 
approach [0 take in teaching the 
course . UCSD insisted on the 
TWO hour exit exam, and , for the 
firs t year, the students were at 

th e total mercy of their scores on 
this one-shot writing sample to 
determine if they were qualified 
or not 10 pass out of Subject A. 
Consequently, many teachers felt 
compelled to "teach for the test." 
The instructors were also advised 
not to teach any grammar or 
basic skills, and were thrown 
packets of OASIS referral slips, so 
that the students with such 
problems might be sent to that 
writing help center for help in 
those areas. The students didn't 
panicularly like that Idea, and 

many InstructOrs were not 
pleased either. 

Now crybaby mstructor 
Krekonan and those wh o read 
the Guardwn article came away 
with the ImpressIOn that the 
Mesa College teachers were a 
hunch of blithering idiots. HIS 
Statements about Ihe Subject A 
faculty'S "madequacles" are 
groundless. [ have stuck with the 
Subject A program despite ItS 
many flaws to work withm it for 
change , Attitudes like Krekorian's 
are , thus, counterproductive. 

One of Mr, Krekorian's 
suggestions was to replace the 
Mesa faculty with "our highly 
qualified graduate students." [ 
wonder if Mr. Krekonan ever 

M"nd(/~, }III IIIt" Y .II>, 11)87 5 
OPINIONS 

listened to his students' horror 
stOries about some of these 
graduate students tryi ng 10 play 
teacher, or how a many of them 
can hardly speak English. Are 
they supposed 10 teach college

Another criticism centered 
around course content. Despite 
UCSD's recommendation that no 
grammar be taught in Subject A, 
the concept of a teacher's

The mSldes of the trailers were 
littered with metal shaVIng , dust

Continued from pa~ 3 
to build the facllier and student 
organizallons are not expected to 
be allowed use of the club. 

The facilier location has 
sparked concern among students 
ove r the fate of student parking 
and the location of the Sun God 
Festival. 

Originally student parking in 
the Peterson lot existed In the 
middle rows; however, last year 
the lot was restriped resulti ng in 
student spaces being moved to 
the eastern edge, now eliminated 
by construction. 

"It seemed like it was alm os l 
planned that all the yellow spaces 
are gone," said Associated Students 
(AS.) PresidentJohn Riley. "We are 

~oing to have continued problems 

Selection Is underway for 
WARREN RESIDENT 

ADVISORS 
for 1987-1988 

along these lines if eve rything goes 
as planned by the Parking Offi ce ." 

This' particular elimination of 
student parking is in accordance 
with the Parking OlTice's long 
range plan of moving aU student 
parking to peripheral lots. 
According to Chodorow, the 
entire Peterson lot will be 
eliminated in the futu re to be 
replaced by a plaza and Faculty 
Club expansion. 

The AS has formed an Ad 
Hoc Parking Committee to 
address student parking 
concerns. 

Currently the AS. is searc hing 
for a new slle for the Sun God 
Festival ; howeve r, prohlems have 
arisen. The Athle tic Department

Riley favors locating the 

festival , wh ic h he hopes Will 
have rides this year, in the new 
parking lot near the BioMedical 
Library ; however, he says the 
AS. is in a "catch-22" posi tion. 
Riley fears administration 
condemnation for the 
"contradiction" of closing a 
parking lot during complaints of 
student parking inadequacy. ~

UCSD Soanng Club takes you for a ride 
By LINDA j. GLA VE 

SURROUNDED by barren. rock- hoked hills. ign beanng the words 'Jacumba 
AIrport , San DIego Count>" was 
clearl), noticeable, despite its 
peeling white paint and minimal 
sl~e. Located less then 500 yards 
from the Mexi o-United States 
border and 75 miles east of an 
Diego, Jacumba Airport fills the 
baSIC requirement of such a 
facilit}, - It has aircraft, mostl), 
gliders, and a runway. 

I was out there with SIX 
members of the UCSD Soaring 
Club to take a ride m one of 
their 3 sailplanes and to see Just 
what It was all about. The barre n 
landscape seemed appropiate for 
this non-powered flIght. 

The air was cold and windy 
- very cold and windy. The 
ki nd of cold that can only be 
found on the half-desert in the 
wintertime.

keep the natural atmosphere, but 
there were also other reasons for 
the deSIgn." 

Earher this academIC year, 
students WItnessed the 
dIsappearance of more than 250 
trees In the eucalyptus groves 
near Central Library. This area 
was cleared to make room for 
the Universiry Center, whi h will 
Include the new student servIces 
offices and the bookstore . "There 
was a dramatic effect In seeing 
the trees go out LO break ground 
for th e new center. Many did not 
realize In looking at the plans 
just how large th e Center IS to 
be ," Cox said . 

Stated in the Long Range Plans 
of 1981 , a book put out by 
Campus Planning, "this policy 
lof sparing treesl will be 
generally retained as It appltes to 
the grove edge , but it WIll be 
modified to permit selective 

I had rtdden up to Jacumba 
with Alan Thomp on, a former 
Warren EEC major ('85) and 
the Certified Right Instructor 
( A) who backseated our flights . 
The othe r members of our group 
were each trymg to get a private 
pilot's license , glider rating. 
which allows them to fl)' solo or 
take up a passenger,but not 
charge for the fl ight. As a CA, 
Thompson is auth orized to 
instruct students and to sIgn 
their flight logbooks, as well as to 
charge for passengers. 

Each (Ow flight launch COStS 
'!i13 for club member, and $1 8 
for non-members. Most of this 
fee goes (0 the tow pilot for his 
expenses, and the rest goes to 
the maintenance of the club's 
equipment. However, on the 
weekends between February 21 
and March 22, their once-a-year 

removal of trees to allow the 
remaining trees to reach their 
maximum growth and beauty. 
The quality of the groves can be 
slgnjficantl>, Improved by a 
program of selective removal and 
pruning." 

To many people on the UC D 
campus, the cutting down and 
subsequent uprooting of this 
particular grove of trees has 
drastically changed not onl), the 
ambience of the campus. but · 
caused concel11 In the future of 
the overall look of the campus. 
Some anonymous visual arcs 
students have shown concern 
over the University'S new 
appearance b), placmg crosses 
on many of the eucalyptus tree 
stumps. 

In the past week. the lawn and 
half of the parking lot between 
Peterson Hall and the Sun God 
has been dug up to make room 
for the new Faculty Club. The 
exterior of the building is 
planned so that It WIll blend with 
the natural colors of the adjacent 
grove area. The landscape design

Pines Glider Port , fees for a cable 
and wi nch ground launch (I.e. ,

member and $8 for non -
members. 

In Thompson's view, a ground 
launch is the most ex iting. "It 's 
like being in the space shuttle 
beause we go up really fast at 45° 
angle ," he attests . Bmh Jacumba 
and Torrey Pines are considered 
good flying areas because of the 
ridge Ii ft that comes off a small 
mountain by the runwa), at 
Ja umba , and another one that 
comes off the cliffs at Torre), 
Pines. 

It was in 1809 off JUSt such a 
cliff that Englishman ir George 
Cayley, hailed as the true 
inve ntor of the airplane , 
successfully flew the first full-size 
glider. However, since ballooning

parking lot area in a plaza-like 
setting, according to Dean 
Stanley Chadorow and Will take 
advantage of the site's already 
eXIsting lawn areas and groves. 
A cording to Cox, "absolutely no 
eucalyptus trees will be removed; 
as a matte r of fact , more will be 
planted." 

Becau9C of the concern over 
the dIsappearing "natural 
aspects" of the campus, a task 
force of 20 members, which 
Includes four students, has been 
organized . According to Cox, 
who is the project manager of 
the task force, "the plan is to 
meet over th e course of the next 
six months to develop an 'Open 
Space Master Plan.' " Says 
Patricia Collum , a Campus 
Plan ner, who is also involved in 
the task force , "ICampus] 
Planmng has been concerned for 
some time with setting formal 
guidelines in the expansion of 
the campus , so funding for the 
'Ope n Space Master Plan' was 
Included as a high priority in the 
UC budget." 

"T he task force includes 16 
members of the fac ulry/ staff, 
selected from all over UC D's

had become so popular, heavier-
than -air flight \vas neglected until 
after World War I. Under the 
Treaty of Versailles. Germany 
had been forbidden to form an 
air force. In a classic case of 
rule-bending, the German 
mIlitary simply trained their 
pilots to fly gliders, and they 
eventually built up quite a large 
soaring "air force ." Even today, 
soaring is more popular in 
Germany than anywhere else, 
and the country has a reputation 
for building some of the best 
gliders in the world . 

The glider we were to use 
today was a two-seater, metal 
and fabric construcrion called 
Barge. It looked like a well-used 
and sturdy craft apart from the

creak of metal 1 heard as David

outing, checked over the craft 
before we moved it out onto the 
runway. 

As the glider's canop)' was 
dosed over my head I felt a 
chilling touch of claustrophobia. 
Not only was the plastic inches 
from my face, I was also held 
immobile by the seat straps and 

parachute harness. The only 
pans of my body thal I could 
move were my arms and legs, 
and even then JUSt enough to 
reach the controls. 

The momentary fear passed 
almost instantl}' as the tow plane 
straightened out the tow rope , 
inspccted earlier for an)' frays or 
knots that would deerease its 
strength by 50 percent. 
Thompson went through th e 
routine pre-flight check. 

"Wing when clear," he called 
to Rod , who was standing at the 
left-wing tip. 

Rod checked the sky for any 
planes in a landing approach 
pattern , then , upon seeing none , 
called back, "Pattem's clear," and 
lifted the wing. 

After a wave of the rudder 
from Thompson , the tow plane 
began taxiing down the runway. 
Sitting in front , I was close to the 
noise of the plane and could 
both see and feel the steady 
pressure exened on the glider by 
the tow rope. 

Because the glider, at a scant 
1,000 pounds or so, is much 
lighter than the plalle . we were

LaJolla Tree Trivia 
Larger trees do not flourish along the San Diego 

County coast except at a few promonotories like Torrey 
Pines. where the air is laden with life-giving moisture, 
and in river and creek bottoms. 

In the early 19OOs. the city employed a young fellow 
named Max Watson as city fores te r. One of his jobs was 
to protect the irreplacable grove of Torrey pines, north 
of La Jolla , from grazing cattle, who enjoyed exercising 
their dentures on the precious. trees, and greedy 
woodchoppers. 

Torrey Pines Park is the only place in the world. other 
than Santa Bosa Island , where this species of pine 
grows. The tree was named in 1850 by a member of the 
American-Mexican boundary commission for a New 
York physician. Dr, John Torrey, who was greatly 
interested in western botany. Oddly enough, Torrey 
never set eyes on a Torrey pine. 

Editor's note: The above information, written by Herbert 
Lockwood, was Originally printed in The Independent in 
1968. 

The sound oj chams(lws can be heard w mtng jrom Jenced areas where 
eucalyptus groves are dewnaled.

onlinued from page 8 

Jlrblll11C first. Then the plane 
was 00 the ground and Ilyi ng 
swiftly upward 1 fclt the 
Increased pull a we accelerated 
toward 2,500 feet above the 
ground, where the tow rope 
would be released . 

As we chmbed higher, 1 
realtzed that we weren 't passive 
tailgaters controlled by the tOw 
plane's move ment, but that we 
were actually flying and could 
exert a onsiderable amount of 
control through the 200 foot 
lever that was the tow line . We 
were also subject to all the small 
fluctuations in air currents. 

"Alan likes to take the 126 (a 
single-seater gltder) and buzz the 
cows on the hills and take 
pictures," David had told me 
earlier with a smile. 1 had 
wondered then just what SOrt of 
maneuvers he would put the 
glider through on our flight. 

"Ok.IY, we're at 5,300 fret now 
You can re lease the tow rope ." 
Thompson instructed . 

I pulled the red knob m front 
of me and with a loud pop , we 
were fl)'ing alone For a fra ti on 
01 a second , it seemed as if we 
would fall ou[ of (he sky without 
the tow plane pulling liS along. 
Now that the constant tug was 
gone. 1 realized Just how much 
force had been exerted on the 
light-weight craft. It was also 
much quieter without the 
persistant growl of the tow 
plane's engine. The sound inSide 
a glider is similar to the sound of 
a poor quality cassctte tape at 
mJximum volume. 

Thompson discussed the 
dangers of soaring: 'There's really 
not too many accidents that can 
occur with gliders and most of 
them happen in contests. Ghders 
can only go about 40 to SO miles 
per hour and the fastest ones are 
designed to handle a maximum 
of onl), I SO mile~ per hour." 

ThiS lack of speed, coupled 
v.~th the fact that gliders are not 

flown during bad wcather, is why 
there arc no navigational 
instrument s except a com pass in 
a glider. 

"Nothing really bad IS goi ng ro 
happen unless you do somethmg 
really stupid ," Thomp on stated . 

Parachutes arc usually WOI11 . 
Thompson sa)'s he has never 
had to use one himsel f, but that 
he would feel "pretty dumb If I 
got up there without one and 
then needed it." 

I was also warned by 
MacMillan that it cost $30 to 
repack a chut~ after use, so, 
"don'( bail out unless he says you 
can!" 

Despite all thiS, 1 deCIded to 
go up for another ride . After we 
released this time , Thompson 
handed the controls over to me . 
The twO percent of my mind that 
wasn't fully focused on the 
unfamiliar control s was jumping 
up and down with excitement. I 
was in control of three 
dimensions at once and could

According to Collum, the task 
force hopes to meet three 
objectives in the compilation of 
information for the 'Open Space 
Master Plan, "The first objective is 
to plan where walkways should 
go , designing new ones and 
removing unused ones; the 
second is to set aside area as 

permanent op~n pa e, because 
as of right now any open space 
is, 'technically speaking: 
available for building; and the 
'third objehive is to define 
landscape ~ements for the 
campus. Presently (here is not 
much coordination of the overall 
look." 

The study, which will provide 
guidelines on future 
developmental areas by defining 
formal policies, should be 
compiled by the end of the 
academic year. ~

In an infinite, empty sky I was 
Silting on air, able to go 
wherever I wanted to. 

The la t and best flight of the 
day belonged to MacMillan and 
Thompson. Whereas every other 
flight had been berween 10 and 
15 minutes long, theirs lasted 40 
minutes. They had caught a hfr 
of 200 feet per minute and 
managed to get as high as 
14,000 feet before the dying 
sunset and bitter cold forced 
rhem down . After securIng the 
craft and locking up, we headed 
for large mugs of hot chocolme 
to warm our numbed and meu 
bod,es. 

I can see now why pilots will 
risk the dangers and rigors of 
flying, whether it is a mach-l 
plus fighter jet or a 126 saIlplane

Senior guard scores 29

I 1'S no secret that Greg Kamansky can hit the long range jumper. Shooting from 
different area codes, UCSD's 
Sultan of Swish has made the 
rainbow jumpshot his trademark,

But Saturday night, Kamansky

CommentalY-
NCAA drug policy misguided 
By CHARLES TABESH. Concribuflng sports Editor 
"I 'D certainly rather it be can be justified, 

steroids than cocaine or If any athlete's performance IS 
marijuana," was the diminished by the use of drugs , 

reaction from Oklahoma coach , 'et he is still able to make the 
Barry Switzer, This , of course , te am , then the athlete is still of 
was after Sooner linebacker Brian value to that team. Perhaps his 
Bosworth tested positive for value is less than wha t it would 
steroid use and was banned from be , but then his pa,ment would 
participating in the Orange Bowl be reduced accordingly The 
This attitude - that sterOId use 
isn't good but it's not all that 
bad, while the use of recreanonal 
drugs is an incredible evil - is 
one that IS shared by most of the 
COUntry , but is also an attitude 
that is hypocritical and 
dangerous. The NCAA currently 
tests student·athletes for both 
steroids and recreational drugs, 
but only the testing of steroids 

athlete makes th~ chOIce of 
being at his peak or reducmg h iS 
skill , and will li ve With the 
consequences. 

In college athletics , however, 
the situation is magnified 
because schools don't hire their 
athletes. In fact , an overwhelming 
majority of student-athletes pay 
their college for the privileges of 
anending. The student doesn't 

owe the school hiS beSt athleti c 
performance just as he doesn't 
owe it his best academic 
performance, If the student 
chooses 10 rake advantage of the 
Situation, he can . If the student 
brings re,'c nue to the school 
through gate receipts and 
television revenue , then the 
school is really much more 
Indebted to him. 

Bur if the student-athlete is to 
be tested for drugs, why SlOp 
therd Wh)' shouldn't members 
of the student council or the 
student newspaper be tested? 
Really, all students should be 
tested for drugs. If the goal is to 
produce fine, morally proper 
citizens, then there is no logic to 

.testing one group and not the 
other. 

Oh, but athletes are role 
models for our children. They 
must uphold a certain Image. 
This argument wouldn't be half 
,IS laughable If so many big time 
collegc athletes could count to 
tcn . But more Importantl)' , why is 
u p holdIng an Image a 
prerequisite 10 becomIng an 
athlete? A person's pnvate life is 
supposed 10 be private. BeIng a 
wonderful guy is completel), 
ilTelevant to athletic ability. 

Ironically, many of those who 
yell the loudest for drug testing 
are glamorizing the drinking of

Thank God the rims are 

reinforced: Probably the most 
entenaining basketball action 
occurred during halftime of the 
UCSD - Claremont·Mudd game 
last Saturday night, 

Specta tors we re invited to 
come down from the stands to 
try their luck at the three·point 
shot for free pizzas and t-shirts. 
Hundreds of fans poured out of 
the stands and proceeded to give 
new meaning 10 the word 
"brick." 

Every conceivable type of 
contorted shooting fonn was 
displayed , including one person 
who threw the ball like a 
quarterback, missing the entire 
backboard, pounding the ball 
against the balcony wall . 

Hundreds of shots were taken , 
but without a doubt the shot of 
the day was taken by a shon 
blonde, who defied e\<t!ry law of 
basketball technique by shooting 
a 22-foot shot granny style . The

promotions depanment has been

theme in order to take advantage 
of UCSO's clo eness to Miramar. 

A contest is being held to 
determine the number of points 
each Top Gun will score for rhe 
season. Although Greg 
Kamansky, Brian &ckens, and 
John Salntignon have been 
rapid-fin ng, the other guns on 
the ballot, Cliff Umans and Mike 
Wilbur , have barely made a bang 

all season long. Wilbur has 
played in 12 games with a 1.9

Umans has been in 10 games, 

oring three POIntS for a OJ 
average .

and dished the ball as UCSD 
slashed Claremont 82-73 before 
500 noisy fans in the Triton 
Pavillion . 

"There's no doubt in my mind 
that we have the best division ,Ill 
guards in the country," said 
UCSD head coach Tom Marshall . 
"Greg had a great game and is 
one of [he reasons we have the 
best guards around." 

During one stretch, Kamansky 
demonstrated his scoring 
prowess. The 6-1 Kamansky 
posted up on Claremont's 6-8 
center Scott Lammers, lOok an 
inside pass from teammate Steve 
Oabasinskas and ,cooped to 
short hook over the towering 
Lammers. 63-58 UCSD, 

Kamansky picks up garbage 
layup 65-60 UCSD. 

Kamansky then nicked the ball 
away from Claremont's Chris 
Dribble, UCSD's John Saintignon 
picked up the loose ball, slinged 
it to the streaking Kaman ky [or 
the uncontested layup 67-60 
UCSD 

Kamansky pulls up for a 16-
foot Jump after breaking the 
Claremont press 69-60 UCSD. 

Kamansky grab; a long 
rebound after missing a three 
POIn[ attempt goes inside on the 
Claremont front line to draw the 
foul. Kamansky cans both free 
throws 71-62 UCSD. 

Twelve stra ight points were 
scored by Kamansky in the 
second half, 29 for the game, just 
overshadowing Sai ntingnon's first 
half performance, where he 
scored sixteen of his 21 points. 

Claremont coach David Wells 
was more disappointed with his 
own team's performance. 
'UCSD's a fine team , but we just 
were not mentally prepared ," 
said Wells . "It was a non-
conference game and we pla)'l;d 
tired, but UCSO played an 
excellent game." 

Excellent was not the word to 
describe UCSD's play at the stan 
of the second half. 'We were 
playing like dogmeat at the 
beginning of the second half," 
said Marshall. "So I put in the 
press to try to get things going 
and it seemed to work." 

"We had trouble bringing the 
ball upcourt against their press," 
said Wells , whose tcam fell to 
12-4 . "We tried to scrap back, 
but it was 100 late ." 

UCSD has now beaten three 
teams in the top 20: Clark 
U nivers ity (3rd). Nazareth (7th ) 
and Claremont (20th ). But, since 
UCSD (14-6) plays as an 
indcpendent, getting 10 the 
playoffs will still be a major task. 
"We're probably gOIng to have to 
win our remaining games: said 
Marshall , -Just 10 have a chance 
to be considered for the 
playoffs." 

The Tritons next game is 
against Chri tian Heritage 
College, a team that Marshall 
says " he knows nothing about ,"

UCSD holds off rally 
Triton women defeat CSU San Bernadino 
U CSD, at one point leadi ng by 21 poims. held oIT a furious rally to 
beat Cal Sra te San Bernardi no 
60-55 before a raucous crowd in 
San Bemardino. 

Tracy Ragatz poured in 14 
points . and Sandy Keaton added 
12 points for the TritOns. 

"We played pretty good ," said 
UCSD head coach judy Malone. 
"but when they gm down by that 
many, the sraned full court 
pressing and we didn't score 
very much after." Tritons were 
only able to hit four field goals in 

. the second half. 
The game became very 

physical as 3 Trttons. Shanda 
Elzy, Keaton and Shelie Velie 
fouled out. "The refs were vety 
poor," said Malone, "and it was a 
very emotional, aggressive 
second half. They staned fouling 
all over the place and we JUSt 
we.nt cold after that." 

UCSD (12- 8) was able to 
avenge a loss (It home earlier this 
year to CSUSB where the Tritons 
lost by one point. Although 
UCSD squandered a big lead in 
this encounter, Malone wasn 't 
too disappointed. 

"San Bernardino is a very 
difficult place to play in," said 
Malone. "They had a big, vocal 
crowd - so I was real happy to 
come out of there with a win ." 

Beth Copeland wiped the glass 
with l3 rebounds and Jill Koster 
also pulled down eight boards to 
key the victOry. 

UC D has now played 12 
games tn 21 days. compiling an 
8-4 record during that time. But 
the Tritons' hances of making 
any type o f post-season 
compettt ion look bleak. 

"I t we beat Cal State Los 
Angeles, we'll be considered -
maybe." said Malone. UCSD's 
next home game is next Fr iday 
against Christ College at 7:30 
pm. ~ 

Freshman guard Nancy Caparaz helped SIa\lf off a late 
teammates fouled out.
