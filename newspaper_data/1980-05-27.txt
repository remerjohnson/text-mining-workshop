Academic Senate Decides 
Today on Drop Date Issue 
Fourth-Week Drop Date Possible in Future 

BY LARRY FINKEL 
Today , the Academic 

Senate will meet once again to 
discuss a controversial plan 
that would move the class drop 
date back from the 'sixth to the 
fourth week and provide a 
transcript "w' withdrawal 
mark for courses dropped after 
that date. 

The senate had been 
discussing the proposal since 
January, but has been unable 
to muster a quorum of 50 
professors of its 800 members 
in order to take official action . 

Should the proposal be 
passed at this afternoon's 
meeting, it will then go before 
the systemwide Academic 
Senate for final approval. 

The plan, formulated by the 
Committee on Educational 
Policy, has met strong student 
opposition. A {r~up of 
students led by Bob ~1m8lVl 
and Zephyr Goldamith is 
currendy trying to organize 
faculty members to vote 
against the propouI. 

The students would like the 
sixth week established 81 the 
eartiest elate that a "'W' cbuld 
be placed on tranacriptJ, but 

otherwise agree with the CEP 
plan. 

In a letter circulated to the 
senate in February, the 
Associated Students claimed 
that by establishing a "W" 
after the fourth week, the 
proposal might be more costly 
to implement than the present 
system . 

The AS cited data from the 
registrar's office that the 
average class size decreases 

by len than 10 fM"8Il in the 
fifth and sixth weeks of the 
quarter. 

that the current system has 
allowed students to abuse the 
late drop privilege by trying a 
class several time. to get a 
better grade. 

Bond has said the new 
proposal will more accurately 
reflect a student's ability and 
that students who mUit drop 
classes during the later weeks 
of the quarter would not be 
harmed academicaDy by a few 
"Wa". 

The current proposal by the 
CEP came up when the 
committee looked at the rules 
and regulations regardins 
drops at UCSD and 
discovered that no rules have 
been established by the senate 
concerning drops. The 
existing procedure is only 
administrative. 

After examining the 
regulations of other UC 
campuses and soliciting 
advice from the campus 
community, the CEP put forth 
its CWTeI'It proposal which they 
feel give. students more 
control over whether they 
should drop a dan. 

Bomb Threat Hits HL Former AS President Carlos Montalvo has criticized the CEP proposal for the lack 
of any written studies which 
substantiate the problem. the 
committee says exist. 

Bond has said that it would 
be up to the faculty to establish 
the ground rules in their 
courses by the fourth week, 
and after this time here should 
be no shift in the emphasis of 
the course. 

Several hundred persons 
were evacuated from Cluster 
Library last Friday morning 
after the Doily Guardian 
received a phone call warning 
of a bomb. 

It was the second prank 
bomb threat made to the 

Revelle library in the past two 
weeks. 

An unidentified male caller, 
speaking with a heavy foreign 
accent, warned the Doily 
Guardian that the library 
should be evacuated between 
9: 15 am and 9:30 am, "or 

Threat Hoax Cancels 
Classes, Midtenns 
Evacuation Angers Math Students 

BY PETER MORTENSEN 
Newt Editor 

It seems that mathema· 
tics professor Jay Filmore 
has had more than his share 
of problems this year with 
giving midterms and final 
exams. They keep getting 
bomb threats. 

And Fibnore's students, 
most of whom studied 
many hours prior to the 
tests, are not a bit happy 
with the ongoing problem of 
being evacuated in the 
midst of demonstrating 
their mathematical 

, expertise. 
Friday morning's bomb 

threat was the third such 
hoax this year which ha 
caused one of Filmore's 
classes to mis an important 
test. 

"It's just not fair, " said 
one of Filmore's students as 
she arrived back in her 
dorm from the HL 

evacuation. The woman 
had studied "intensely" for 
seven days for the test 
which' made up a good 
portion of the Math 2C final 
grade. 

"I went to (Revelle Dean) 
Ernie Mort and told him 
how we all felt. We're just 
fed up with the whole 
thingt she said. 

"He said he would talk to 
Filmore but I don't know 
what will happen," she 
added. 

"A lot of people seemed 
to know that there was 
going to be a bomb threat," 
she said, noting a sparse 
tumout for such a weighty 
midterm, and the relative 
calm and humor surroun· 
ding the evacuation. 

Filmore reportedly told 
students as they filed out of 

PleatU! turn to (JORe 8 

your people wiD be hurt." 
Campus po~ce had received 

a call the night before from 
apparently the same person, 
who warned that a bomb 
would explode on campus 
sometime Friday. He would 
not specify the time or place of 
the alleged bomb, but said he 
would give more information 
to po~ce, on Friday, according 
to campus detective Murray 
PenhoUow.

Chemistry professor Tom 
Bond, former CEP chairman, 
has said that the new system 
will help prevent wasted lab 
space and classroom time by 
encouraging students to drop 
classes by the fourth week, in 
order to avoid the "w" being 
placed on their transcripts. 

Students are currently 
allowed to drop classes until 
the sixth week; stamps and 
signatures are required. 

Bond has in the 

Faculty would have to make 
clear what material was to be 
covered and what the 
responsibility of the students 
would be, according to Bond. 

Spielmann argues that the 
r.roposal is too rigid and says it 
'was put forth by a core of 
very conservative faculty who 
are not representative of the 
(acuity at large." 

(Pediatrics Professor 
Robert Hamburger attempted 
to amend the proposal so that

Editor: 
This month Congress will 

enact registration for the draft. 
This means thai the firsl week 
of summer vacation, 18 to 20 
year·old boys are supposed to 
begin registering at the post 
office. This letter is a plea for 
resistance to registration. 

It should be clear to a nyone 
who has taken an interesl that 
this country is gearing up for 
war. The enemy is as yet 
undear, but the tell. tale signs 
are unmistakeable. 

Carter has repeatedly 
hinted at the use of military 
force against Iran, and indeed, 
the attempted rescue mission 
is an indication of Washing· 
ton's itchy trigger finger. 

Congress will pass 
registration funding without 
even a debate. Recent Gallop 
polls show that most 
Americans expect this country 
to be at war in the near future. 
It would seem that people want 
to go to war! 

Why this driven, unthinkin~ 
desire for military build.up. 
How have we slipped into this 
aggressive attitude with such 
frightening ease? This country 
is sliding effortlessly toward 

war without so much as a yelp 
of displeasure. 

It is imperative, then, that 
this trend be impeded 
immediately. 1/ we show no 
resistance to registration for 
the draft, we are giving 
Washington the green light for 
its war plans. W e a re giving 

letters 
our sanction to militarism and 
aggression. How can it be seen 
as anything else? 

Resistance, then, is crucial. 
But it must be more than an 
isolated act of the individual. 
To be an effective protest, the 
action must be organized and 
it must be popular. Thursday, 
May 29, there will be a rally on 
Revelle plaza for the purpose 

of proposi ng a detailed plan of 
organized resistance to 
registration to be carried out 
this summer. 

The San Diego Students for 
Peace will also be available 
and mobilized this summer to 
give support to those who 
resist. This is not an action 
taken lightly, a nd it is 
important to know that you are 
not alone. 

A popular , unifi e d 
demonstration of solidarity 
against military aggression is 
vital at this time. It will be 
scary to resist, and easy to 
rationalize acquiescence. 
However, fear grows out ·of 
isolation and acquiescence 
grows out of ignorance. I plead 
that the reader of this letter 
attempt to avoid both and join 
us in our united struBsle.

Why is Dirk Bad? 
Editor: 

I kept quiet all through the 
arguments about Ted Burke's 
Dylan (Slow Train Coming) 
review, although my fingeu 
were itching to let you know 
where I (and hopefully others) 
stood. 

But now I am incensed -
shall I say my camel's bacl~ 
has been broken? Barry 
Alfonso's review of Dirk 
Hamilton's Thug 01 Love 
(Daily Guardian, May 15) is 
what causes me to formally 
criticize you. 

I have never heard of Dirk 
Hamilton before and it is not 
my habit to read every article 
in the Guardian, as few really 
interest me. But this record 
review was 50 unsubatantia· 
tedly opinionated I couldn't 
help being interested as to why 
you printed this review. 

Ask Barry Alfonso why 
Dirk Hamilton' s musical 
abilities are the horrible things 
he says they are. He never told 
me. Why is Hamilton 
repulsive? Why can't he figure 
out what Hamilton is talking 
about? 

I have no idea who Larry 
Carlton, Bill Payne and Garth 
Hudson are - I am not your 
average rock· adorer , but I 
would like to know what these 

men have done - whose 
albums they have worked on, 
and what exactly they did in 
association with Dirk 
Hamilton. 

I agree. that Hamiltop's 
song titles,don't exactly sound 
like record hits, but Alfonso 
has not shown me there is any 
relationship·of the song titles to 
the song contents (although I 
agree this is highly probable). 

Tell me, Mr. AI/onso, why 
is it that Dirk Hamilton has a 
"spooky weirdness?" Is he into 
witchcraft? That's what it 
sounds like. Nothing you told 
me gave me the imptession 
that Hamilton was sel/· 
righteous, but you told me he 
was. Was he irritating? You 
never told me why. Why is he 
obnoxious and a creep? Did he

Earthquakes Rock 
Mammoth Lakes 
MAMMOTH LAKES, Calif. 
- Dozens of aftershocks 
rumbled through California 's 
midsection yesterday, one day 
after two powerful earth· 
quake s left a co upl ~ 
hospitalized with serious skull 
injuries. Authorities warned 
jittery residents that more 
major quakes might be on the 
way. 

One big aftershock 
registering 4 .7 on the Richter 
scale struck the Mammoth 
Lakes area in the Sierra 
Nevadas about 300 miles 
north of Los Angeles at 5:25 
a.m., according to the US 
Seismographic Station at 
Berkeley. 

earl Johnson of the US 
Geological Survey said the 
aftershocks were rolling 
through the region "once 
every two or three minutes. " 

director of the US Geological 
Survey in Washington , D.C., 
warned that "areas in Sierra 
Nevada from Bishop to Mono 
Lake, and adjacent regions in 
Nevad a may expe rie nce 
additional earthquakes and 
associated strong ground 
shaking during the next 
several days." 

The office's director, Alex 
Cunningham, said he was told 
by the Geological Survey that 
based on past quakes, "the 
likelihood is that aftershock 
activity will continue over the 
next several days and people 
should take precautionary 
measures .... " 

"I'm not trying to alarm or 
panic anyone," he added. 
" We have had 50 to 100 
aftershocks today. People 
should take prudent action."

George Bush Drops From GOP Race 
ives Delegates, Support, Nomination to Ronald Reagan 

HOUSTON - George 
Bush, strapped for delegate 
votes and campaign funds, 
bowed out of the Republican 
presidential race Monday, 
throwing his support - and 
the GOP nomination - to 
Ronald Reagan. 

The conservative former 
governor of California thus will 
cout unchall'enged into the 
Republican National Conven· 
tion in Detroit this July to claim 
the nomination that narrowly 
eluded hi. grasp four years 
ago. 

Bush sent Real(a~ a 

telegram congratulating him 
on his "superb campaign" for 
the nomination and pledging 
Bush 's " wholehearted 
support" in the fall campaign 
to remove President Carter 
from the White House. 

Bush , a former Texas 
'congressman, UN Ambassa· 
dor and Republican national 
chairman, said he would urge 
the 255 convention delegates 
he has won so far this primary 
season, plus any elected in the 
future, to support Reagan at 
the GOP convention.

Early Nationals Snag 

Baseball Strike Averted 
By Last Minute Talks 

New York (AP) - A major league baseball strike was 
averted last Friday when 11th hour negotiations between the 
club owners and the Players Association produced a 
settlement in the marathon contract dispute that had 
threatened to interrupt the 1980 season.

A long five-month tennis 
season closed this weekend in 
Athens, Georgia, when 
UCSD's Paul Metsch and 
John Rosenberg lost 6-2, 7-5 
in the opening round of the 
NCAA Individual Tourna-
ment. 

The number one doubles 

The Daily' Guardian 

Sports 
team played into the finals in 
last week's NCAA Division III 
Championships, earning a 
berth in the Nationals and a 
short trip to Georgia. This was 
the best finish in Triton history. 

Play began early due to an 
unexpectedly large number 01 
contestants. Entrants were 
arbitrarily chosen for the 
opening round on Thursday, 
with Metsch and Rosenberg 
included in the first matches. 

The matches were forced to 
the indoor courts because of 
indecisive rain, and their game 
didn't get underway until three 
hours past the scheduled time. 

But Rosenberg attributed their 
loss primarily to overconfi· 
dence. "We had so many 
opportunities in the second set 
that we didn 't capitalize on. 
We should have won that 
second set," he said. 

The NCAA Individual 
Tournament ranks among the 
best competition in the world. 
The number one seed is listed 
as 45th in international 
standings and entrants must 
fight through tough opponents 
to enter the tournament. 

Tad Yamaguchi, the Triton 
tennis coach, said, "Even if 
they did lose, the important 
thing is that they represented 
us. They got to the finals in the 
division, and made it all the 
way to the Nationals. All in all, 
it was a pretty good season," 
he said. 

The tennis players are tired 
but satisfied with the season. 
"I'm trading in my rackets for 
frisbees," said Rosenberg. 
"The season had its ups and 
downs, but it finally paid off 
with me and Paul making the 
finals and going to Nationals. 
I'm glad it's over."

The agreement was announced by Marvin Miller ,

their last meeting of a day of bargaining that began at lOam

finished 17th in the high jump 
and John Serrano ended up 
ninth in the decathalon at the 
NAlA National Track and 
Field Championships this 
weekend. They were the only 
Triton representatives in the 
competition held at Aboline 
Christian University in Texas 
that marked the end of the 
Triton track season. 

Serrano earned 3,673 
decathalon points the first day 
of the event, and started the 
second day strongly with a 
personal best in the high 
hurdles of 14.8 seconds. 

In the second event of the 
day, the discus throw, Serrano 
achieved another personal 
best, with a mark of 107' 
11 112" . 

The pole vault was 
Serrano's downfall, as he 
managed to clear only a 
disappointing 9'3f4" after 
making an encouraging 11' in 
warm-upll. 

Serrano hurled the javelin 
165' in the next event and 
went on to the 1500 meter 
run - the most grueling event 
of the decathalon. 

In this event, Serrano had

PyraDlid ScheDle 
Holds 'Power' Rally 

Molten Rock May Be Moving 
To Top of Mt: St. Helens 

LOS ANGELES -
Several hundred supporters of 
the latest endleu-chain 
scheme to sweep Southern 
California - pyramids-
rallied yesterday in Griffith 
Park and called upon local law 
enforcement officials to cease 
"haraument" of pyramid 
participanll. 

No incidents were reported 
by police at the merry-go-
round area of the park where 
the rally attracted hawkers of 
"Pyramid Power" T-shirts, 
attorneys oHering legal advice 
for pyramid players and 
circulaton of petitions. 

District Attorney John Van 
de Kamp, City Attorney Burt 
Pines and numerous police 
departmenll have repeatedly 
warned citizens that the 
teheme is illegal.

By Senate 
Con.inued from pafe I 
establilhed as the date the 
"W" should be placed on 
tranlCriptl, but was defeated 
by the CEP in a 14 to 2 vote.)

inabiity of the Academic 
Senate to reach a quonan 
since Ja~ and hope. more 
Ieru'ed tacuIty, who c:ornprde 
the IflNlte, wiI show up for 
Tuesday's vote. 

The meeting wiD begin at 
3:30 pm in Till 104. 

A petition circulated at the 
rally charged police and the 
news media with harassment 
of pyramid participants. The 
petition was expected to be 
sent to Van de Kamp, 
circulators said. 

It stated that "to allow the 
harassment to continue is 
against all principles set forth 
in our nation - a free 
country." 

Century City attomey Larry 
Fielder said he will defend his 
pyramid clients by claiming 
the law barring the scheme is 
vaguely worded. 

Another lawyer, 74-year-
old Gladys Towles Root, also 
defended the pyramids. 
"Nowhere dse can a working 
man go to get 10 much 

.. 
money. 

Promoters of the risk-laden, 
64-slot pyramids promise up 
to $16,000 to people who can 
persuade two others to join 
them in putting up S 1 ,000 
apiece-

What did Hamilton get in

Five more persons nussmg 

since Saturday - when they 
were last seen 10 miles from 
the peak - were found 
yesterday near T radedollar 
Lake, said a spokesman for 
the Skamania County sheriff's 
office. 

The spokesman, who asked 
not to be quoted by name, said 
all five had been picked up by 
a National Guard helicopter 
and were being taken to 
Toledo. "They were fine," he 
said. 

The quakes, measuring less 
than 3.0 on the Richter scale, 
appeared to be closer to the 

surface than quakes which 
preceded the eruption Sunday 
morning that sent ash over 
western Washington and 
Oregon. 

" Before the Sunday 
eruption, the earthquakes 
were registering as deep as 20 
kilometers wi thin the 
volcano," said Don Finley of 
the US Geological Survey. 
"Now they register seven 
kilometers. That possibly 
could be an indication that 
magma could be moving up." 

Meanwhile, helicopter 
searches for the missing were 
halted Monday by cloud cover 
that cut visibility to half a mile.

hoped to run a 4:25 time to 
make up for his poor showing 
in the pole vault. But he ran 
only a slow 4:42 in the 97 
degree Texas heat, and 
finished with 6,687 total 
points-131 poinll less than 
his entering total and a ninth 
place finish overall. 

Larry Flynn made the 
starting jumJ} height of 6' 8 Ih". 
But when the bar was raised to 
6' 10", he failed to clear it in 
three attempts, and was forced 
to aettle for a 17th place finish 
out of 41 entrants. The 
winning height was 7'2!', a 

new NAIA record. 
Serrano's nin th Jllace 

decathalon finish and Flynn's 
17th in the high jumps are 
respectable finishes for NAIA 
National Championships. 
"These championships are 
high cIaaa competition; they 
take no back seat to the 
NCAA," said coach Andy 
Skief. 

Serrano is only a 
sophomore, and to finish 
among the top ten in 
decathalon competition at the 
national level is a remarkable 
achievment, according to 
Coach Skief.
