Commision 
calls for state 

university 
overhaul 

By CHRlmNE KWON 
Senior Staff Writer 

The state's public higher educa-
tion system should undergo a major 
reorganiz:1tion, Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger's Califomia 
Perfonnance Review panel has sug-
gested, offering a list of 33 recom-
mendations in an August repon. 

Members of the panel met under 
a mandate from the governor to 
examine many aspects of the state 
and "blow up the boxes" to make rec-
ommendations on how to increase 
efficiency while reducing costs. 

"We cannot afford waste and 
fraud in any department or 
agency," Schwarzenegger said in a 
statement. "Together with my ded-
icated team of expens, we will 

CaJiforDia the tint true 2 ht'-I .. ~~-.Jce~n~tury governmLllt in America." 
Among its recomme l" lations, 

the commission suggested eliminat-
ing portions of the Cal Grant, the 
state's .6DaDcial aid award for low-
income students. Under the plan, 
the state would replace the grant 
with fee waivers to be used at all 
UC and CSU campuses. 
Community coUeges would also 
receive authority to allocate Cal 
Grant funds to financially needy

The Technology Review mag-
azine, published by the 
Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, has named three 
members of the UCSD communi-
ty to its 2004 list of the world's 
top-lOO young innovators. _ 

Selected from a pool of about 
500 nominations, chemistry grad-
uate student Jamie Link, postdoc-
toral pharmacology researcher 
Lei Wang and assistant professor 
of computer science Serge 
Belongie received the honor for 
their contributions to science and 
technology. 

"For UCSD to have three 
individuals represented in this 
prestigious list is a testament to 
our university's strength in sci-
ence and technology, as weU as 
our ability to produce the innova-
tors of the future," Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox said in a univer-
sity statement. 

At 26, Link was the youngest 
individual of the year and also one 
of 31 women who made the list. 
Link said access to research was 
key to encouraging more· women 
to participate in technical fields.

New campaign targets 

college-age voters 
The u.s. Election Assistance Commission 

has earmarked more than $600,000 as part of 
an effort to bring college voters to the polls on 
Nov. 2. 

The money is part of the independen~ 
nonpartisan commission's Help America Vote 
College Poll Worker Program. Grantees, which 
include groups at various college campuses, 
will use the funds to encourage students at 
higher education institutions to serve as poll 
workers and assistants. 

In California, CSU Long Beach will receive 
a $25,000 grant for its "Love Me, I'm a Poll 
Worker" campaign to recruit poll workers for 
Los Angeles County. Participants will wear 
special T-shirts promoting the program every 
Tuesday until election day. 

Student voters suppressed, 
l~beral group says 

A new report by the liberal group Moving 
Ideas states it has found evidence of "wide-
spread voter intimidation and suppression" by 
election officials. A portion specifically focuses 
on challenges faced by college students. 

Many are unaware of a 1979 Supreme 
Court decision that allows students to use 
their college and dormitory addresses when 
registering to vote, and many succumb to 
intimidation that prevents them from register-
in& the group said. 

The group cited a legal challenge by a Texas 
district attorney to voter registration efforts at a 
predominantly black college on the same resi-
dency question, despite the fact that the 1979 
decision was based on students at the same 
school. 

In addition, it reported that officials erro-
neously told University of Arizona students 
they would face felony charges if they regis-
tered out-of-state voters and wrongly cau-
tioned students at the University of Delaware 
that they might lose financial aid and face tax 
problems for using dorm addresses for their 
registration. 

UC receives $2.4 million 
digital library grant 

The Library of Congress has awarded $2.4 
million to the UC Califomia Digital Library for 
the development of new technology for creat-
ing digital archives of government documents. 

Senator Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) said the 
money will help the university preserve the 
·state's fascinating political history~ 

• Y; 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY. OCTOBER 4. 2004 

The award was one of eight made by the 
LOC across the country to develop the digital 
infrastructure necessary to preserve the gov-
ernment's Web-based documents. 

Currently, the govemment posts more than 
65 percent of its reports without making print-
ed editions. The digital documents remain 
available for an average of just four months, 
the LOC said in a statement. 

COL will work closely with UCSD's San 
Diego Supercomputer Center, with help from 
New York University and University of North 
Texas. The effort will initially focus on federal, 
state and local political movements, like the 
2003 gubernatorial recall election. 

Berkeley scientist to clone 
anti-AIDS plan genes 

UC Berkeley and the govemment of Samoa 
have aMounced an agreement over research 
and development of a new drug to fight the 
AIDS virus. 

The deal supports Samoa's assertion of 
'national sovereignty' over a gene sequence of 
a drug extracted from the bark of its native tree 
that scientists say may help in the fight against 
the epidemic. 

Under the terms of the agreemen~ a UC 
Berkeley professor of chemical engineering will 
clone the genes of the tree and insert them 
into bacteria, which will function as live "facto-
ries' for the drug. Scientists are currently study-
ing the druis potential for forcing the AIDS 
virus out of hibemation in the body's immune 
cells, making it susceptible to anti-AIDS drugs 
currently in use. 

If the chemist is successful, the people of 
Samoa will receive set royalties from commer-
cial profits arising from sales of the plant-
derived compound. Under the contract, the 
campus and Samoa will also negotiate the dis-
tribution of the drug to developing nations at a 
"minimal profit.' 

Teens' condom use rises 
after counseling 

HIV-positive teens are more likely to use 
condoms - especially with unaffected partners 
- if they've undergone one-on-one counselin& 
researchers at UCLA's AIDS Institute have 
found. 

The researchers believe their findings may 
help develop a new strategy to control the 
spread of the virus. 

They reported their findings in the October 
issue of the Journal of Acquired Immune 
Defidency Syndromes.

a new agreement was not reached 
between Associated StudentS, the 
Graduate Student Association and 
University Centers. 

Since summer, A.S. President 
leon Pae, GSA president Kristopher 
Kohler, University Centers Director 
Gary Ratcliffe and Vazquez have 
continued negotiating the terms of a 
new Master Space Agreement and 
MOU. 

"I understand that the Master 
Space Agreement and the 
Memorandum of Understanding are 
documentS that were drafted way 
back when and then amended, so I 
understand that we need to modify 
and update [them)," Pae said. "Now 
the university'S talcing another stance 
in the aspect that the [Master Space 
Agreement) and the MOU are no 
longer going to exist ... something 
that we, of course, never negotiated." 

The Graduate Student 
Associations interpretation of the 
previous agreements argues that the 
previous contraCtS were to be in 
effect for five years, with Associated 
Student and the Graduate Student 
Association retaining the option to 
grant two-year renewals. Both bod-
ies passed resolutions last spring to 
renew the documentS for another 
two years. 

"Its not the case that the MOU is 
in perpetuity; what is the case is that 
if the A.S. and GSA ... believe that 
the co-ops are se.rving studentS' 
interests [and) operating in reason-
able ways .. . [then they) can vote for 
two-year renewal options," Kohler 
said. "If at any time they decide not 
to renew ... then the MOU would 
expire." 

However, University Centers 
officials have said that the contraCtS 
were never designed to last indefi-
nitely and are pushing for new lan-
guage that would introduce concrete 

lease terms and other operating pro-
cedures into the documents. 
According to Vazquez, University 
Centers would like to combine the 
Master Space Agreement and MOU 
into one overarching operating 
agreement, with sub-lease agree-
ments customized for each co-op. 

"Essentially, what [we) need to do 
right now is to focl\S on one operat-
ing agreement, get the terms estab-
lished, and then the A.S. and GSA 
can begin working with the co-ops 
on each of their neases)," Vazquez 
said. 

However, during a council dis-
cussion, A.S. Vice President External 
Rigo Marquez accused the wUversi-
ty of using the complicated negotia-
tion process to force out the co-ops 
and replace them with more prof-
itable ventures. 

Under current lease terms, the 
co-ops pay rent that is 20 times 
below market value. 

Ratcliffe denied the charges, say-
ing that administrators' main con-
cern is the students' interest. The 
lease agreement sought by the uni-
versity is standard practice, and the 
tenns of the one offered to the co-
ops may be more lenient than most, 
he said. 

"The agreementS are something 
thats necessary, and if it was an enti-
ty other than the co-ops, it would 
actually be a fairly routine process," 
Ratcliffe said. .. [The co-ops 1 really 
view that MOU as ... their security 
blanket. It gives them peace of mind 
about their status here. So for us to 
say that its time to get what we view 
as better-functioning documents is 
for them fairly traumatic." 

Student negotiators have said 
that the threat of an Oct. 15 deadline 
put the co-ops at a disadvantage6us 
posi tion during negotiations. 
However, Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Joseph W. Watson 

denied their requestS for an exten-
sion of the cut-off date, Pac said. 

I 
"When one side is threatening I 

with termination, then it doesn't 
make for a very equitable negotiat- I 
ing envirorunent," Kohler said. La Jolla 

TRITON CARD. 
at Daphne'sl 

• Gyros Pita. In an Aug. 23 letter, Aguilar stat-
ed that the university would termi-
nate the current month-to-month 
lease by that date "only if substantial 
progress is made toward crafting a 
new lease [or) operating agreement 
which addresses the concerns of 
UCSD." 

According to Pae and Kohler, the 
university will be the sole judge on 
whether "substantial progress" has 
been made. If no agreement is 
reached, the university might unilat-
erally implement new documentS, 
Kohler said. 

"If they cannot unilaterally 
implement a new agreement, I think 
the universi ty, beca use of the seI f-
imposed deadline, has put them-
selves in a position where they're 
going to be forced to kick the co-ops 
out of their spaces," Kohler said. 

The co-op oversight committee, 
which was established by the MOU, 
has not participated in the negotia-
tion process. The university argues 
that since the MOU has expired, the 
committee no longer exists. 

"I do think the [committee) is a 
neutral body with open channels of 
communication, so it would be a 
good forum for negotiation, but I can 
understand why it's not the best," 
conunittee chair Kate PiUon said. 

Associated Students, the 
Graduate Student Association and 
University Centers will continue 
negotiating until the October dead-
line. At its Sept. 29 meeting, the A.S. 
Council agreed in a non-binding 
vote to seek legal counsel.

65 percent of its reports without making print-
ed editions. The digital documents remain 
available for an average of just four months, 
the LOC said in a statement. 

COL will work closely with UCSD's San 
Diego Supercomputer Center, with help from 
New York University and University of North 
Texas. The effort will initially focus on federal, 
state and local political movements, like the 
2003 gubematorial recall election. 

Berkeley scientist to clone 
anti-AIDS plan genes 

UC Berkeley and the government of Samoa 
have aMounced an agreement over research 
and development of a new drug to fight the 
AIDS virus. 

The deal supports Samoa's assertion of 
' national sovereignty' over a gene sequence of 
a drug extracted from the bark of its native tree 
that scientists say may help in the fight against 
the epidemic 

Under the terms of the agreement a UC 
Berkeley professor of chemical engineering will 
clone the genes of the tree and insert them 
into bacteria, which will function as live "facto· 
ries' for the drug. Scientists are currently study· 
ing the druis potential for forcing the AIDS 
virus out of'hibemation in the body's immune 
cells, making it susceptible to anti·AIDS drugs 
currently in use. 

If the chemist is successful, the people of 
Samoa will receive set royalties from commer· 
cial profits arising from sales of the plant· 
derived compound. Under the contract, the 
campus and Samoa will also negotiate the dis· 
tribution of the drug to developing nations at a 
"minimal profit' 

Teens' condom use rises 
after counseling 

HIV-positive teens are more likely to use 
condoms - especially with unaffected partners 
- if they've undergone one-on-one counseling, 
resea rchers at UCLA's AIDS Institute have 
found. 

The researchers believe their findings may 
help develop a new strategy to control the 
spread of the virus. 

They reported their findings in the October 
issue of the Journal of Acquired Immune 
Oefidency Syndromes.

coruinued from /XJge I 

a new agreement was not reached 
between Associated Students, the 
Graduate Student Association and 
University Centers. 

Since summer, A.S. President 
Jenn Pae, GSA president Kristopher 
Kohler, University Centers Director 
Gary Ratcliffe and Vazquez have 
continued negotiating the terms of a 
new Master Space Agreement and 
MOU. 

"I understand that the Master 
Space Agreement and the 
Memorandum of Understanding are 
documents that were drafted way 
back when and then amended, so I 
understand that we need to modify 
and update [them]," Pae said. "Now 
the Wliversity's taking another stance 
in the aspect that the [Master Space 
Agreement) and the MOU are no 
Tonger going to exist ... something 
that we, of course, never negotiated." 

The Graduate Student 
Association's interpretation of the 
previous agreements argues that the 
previous contracts were to be in 
effect for five years, with Associated 
Student and the Graduate Student 
Association retaining the option to 
grant two·year renewals. Both bod-
ies passed resolutions last spring to 
renew the documents for another 
two years. 

"It's not the case that the MOU is 
in perpetuity; what is the case is that 
if the AS. and GSA ... believe that 
the co-ops are serving students' 
interests [and] operating in reason-
able ways ... [then they) can vote for 
two-year renewal options," Kohler 
said. "If at any time they decide not 
to renew ... then the MOU would 
expire." 

However, Uruversity Centers 
officials have said that the contracts 
were never designed to last indefi· 
nitely and are pushing for new lan-
guage that would introduce concrete 

lease terms and other operating pro-
cedures into the documents. 
According to Vazquez, University 
Centers would like to combine the 
Master Space Agreement and MOU 
into one overarching operating 
agreement, with sub-lease agree· 
ments customized for each co-op. 

"Essentially, what [we] need to do 
right now is to fOC\\S on one operat-
ing agreement, get the terms estab-
lished, and then the A.S. and GSA 
can begin working with the co·ops 
on each of their Deases]," Vazquez 
said. 

However, during a council dis-
cussion, A.S. Vice President External 
Rigo Marquez accused the universi-
ty of using the complicated negotia-
tion process to force out the co-ops 
and replace them with more prof· 
itable ventures. 

Under current lease terms, the 
co-ops pay rent that is 20 times 
below market value. 

Ratcliffe denied the charges, say· 
ing that administrators' main con· 
cern is the students' interest. The 
lease agreement sought by the uni-
versity is standard practice, and the 
tenns of the one offered to the co-
ops may be more lenient than most, 
he said. 

"The agreements are something 
tha t's ne<;essary, and if it was an eno· 
ty other than the co-ops, it would 
actually be a fairly routine process," 
Ratcliffe said. "[The co·ops) really 
vic:w that MOU as ... their security 
blanJc:et. It gives them peace of mind 
about their status here. So for us to 
say that its time to get what we view 
as better-functioning documents is 
for them fairly traumatic." 

Student negotiators have said 
that the threat of an Oct. 15 deadline 
put the co-ops at a disadvantageOus 
position during negotiations. 
However, Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Joseph W. Watson 

denied their requests for an exten- I 
sion of the cut-off date, Pae said. 

"When one side is threatening I 
with termination, then it doesn't 
make for a very equitable negotiat· I 
ing envirorunent," Kohler said.

Kohler said.

"If they cannot unilaterally 
implement a new agreement, I think 
the universi ty, because of the self-
imposed deadline, has put them-
selves in a position where they're 
going to be forced to kick the co-ops 
out of their spaces," Kohler said. 

The co-op oversight committee, 
which was established by the MOU, 
has not participated in the negotia-
tion process. The university argues 
that since the MOU has expired, the 
committee no llJnger exists. 

"I do think the [committee) is a 
neutral body with open channels of 
communication, so it would be a 
good forwn for negotiation, but I can 
understand why it's not the best," 
committee chair Kate Pillon said. 

Associated Srudents, the 
Graduate Student Association and 
University Centers will continue 
negotiating until the October dead· 
line. At its Sept. 29 meeting, the A.S. 
Council agreed in a non-binding 
vote to seek legal counsel.

Textbook bill not strong enough 
Legislators should pressure publishers to reduce prices 

By BRIAN UIGA 
Senior Staff Writer 

Here's a fun game, upperclass-
men: Take your freshman calculus 
book "Calculus: Early 
Transcendentals" into the UCSD 
Bookstore. Place it side by side 
with the current edition, and com-
pare words and sentences on any 
given page. You might notice a sig-
ni ficant similarity. In fact, the only 
part of the textbook that seems sig-
nificantly different is the problems 
section, where existing problems 
are renumbered. 

The fact is, students in science 
and engineering classes are being 
played like cheap fiddles when it 
comes to buying textbooks. In sub-
jects that have not changed since 
the time of Isaac Newton, the 
appearance of a new textbook edi-
tion covering these subjects every 
one to four years has become a 
remarkably r.ommonplace occur-
rence. 

Liberally encouraged by local 
pledge-mongers at the California 
Public Interest Research Group 
and their report "Ripoff 101 : How 
the Current Practices of the 
Textbook Industry Drive Up the 
Cost of College Textboolts," Gov, 
Arnold Schwarzenegger recently 
signed a bill to stem the tide of ris-
ing textbook costs. This landmark 
bill asks professors to consider 
price in their choice of course 
materials and encourages the 
University of California adminis-
tration to encourage their faculty 
to look at these textbook costs. 

Yet with all of this asking and 
encouraging going on, no changes 
are actually mandated by the bill. A 
second bill, which calls for 
stronger action by establishing a 
UC-sponsored rental service, was 
shot down by the gove~nor's office 
beca use the bi 11 doesn't prevent 
universities from charging all stu-
dents for the service, including stu-
dents who don't use the program. 

While it is encouraging that 
the most important office in the 
state. is even willing to pay lip ser-

vice to the issue of rising textbook 
costs while more important prob-
lems (such as the massive budget 
crisis) face the state, the bill stilUs 
nothing more than that. 
Currently, ~any professors at the 
University of California already 
consider price when choosing 
textbooks, especially for entry-
level courses such as calculus, 
where most students have no need 
to keep the textbook for reference 
after the class is completed. 

Asking professors to choose 
cheaper textbooks does not 

address the issue that these text-
books are replaced with new edi-
tions, often yearly. And encourag-
ing administrators to talk: to their 
faculty does not resolve the issue 
that these textbooks are often only 
available as "bundled" editions, 
saddled with additional supple-
ments that professors simply do 
not use. 

Not even the proposed second 
biIJ, with its textbook rental pro-
gram, would so much as deal with 
these problems. The problem does 
not lie with UC faculty and staff. 

Many professors include problem 
numbers for older and newer edi-
tions in their courses, and UCSD 
already has a successful book-lend-
ing service run by the Academic 
Success Program. 

No, the problem lies entirely 
with textbook publishers. For it is 
their insatiable quest for maximum 
profit that causes them to hundle 
textboolts, release new editions 
with renumbered problems when-
ever the market is saturated with 
used textbooks and charge 
American students twice as much as 

the rest of the world by 
taking away: our choice 
to purchase "interna-
tional editions" (i.e. 

paperbaclts) of text-
boolts. 

So why has 
CALPIRG not 
gone after the 
publishers 
directly with 
their proposed 
legislation? 
Well, sadly, 
the state of 
Cali fornia has 
absolutely no 
power to 
regulate the 

international 
corporations 

that publish these 
textboolts. Even if the 

textbook. publishing 
companies were 
California businesses 
and could be regulat-
ed, one needs only to 
look at California's 
lack of success with 
the regulation of its 
electricity industry 
to realize that our 
government is 
entirely unable to 
influence the cause 
of rising textbook 
prices. 

Then why 
bother with 

this bill in 
the first 

place, if it completely misses the 
cause of the textbook cost problem 
while dealing with an entity that 
has no power in the first place? The 
answer is publicity. 

Public awareness of textbook 
publishing practices is the only 
weapon CALPIRG has in this hat-
de. But like the "soft" textbook 
price legislation that bears the sig-
nature of Schwarzenegger, this tac-
tic does not often yield action. 

After publishing "Ripoff 101," 
UCLNs branch of CALPIRG lob-
bied Thomson Learning, and 
demanded fairer prices on the 
"C::lculus: Early Transcendentals" 
textbook they publish. Thomson 
Learning made a statement that 
they would dlscount "some books" 
for UCLA, but gave no details. 
Months later, CALPIRG lobbied 
again, holding Thomson Learning 
accountable for their earlier state-
ments, Even armed with a letter 
signed by 500 faculty members, 
Thomson has yet to issue another 
statement. 

Perhaps CALPIRG has been 
pursuing the wrong prize in its 
attempt to help financially 
strapped students. Textbook. pub-
lishing companies have large legal 
staffs available to combat attacks 
just like this one. Even if 
CALPIRG found complete success 
with the textbook industry, the 
average student would only be able 
[0 save around $300 to 5400 per 
year, assuming that they currently 
pay around 5900 per year for books 
(the average UCSD cost of text-
books according to the CALPIRG 
report). 

On the other hand, student 
fees at the University of 
California rose by an average of 
5700 this year, not including the 
rising costs of university housing 
or the added cost of the mandato-
ry meal plan. And, unlike a cor-
poration, whose allegiance lies 
only with its pocketbook, the 
University of California is theo-
retically accountable to its stu-

Fox must back up words with actions 
Chancellor's accessibility an improvement over previous administrations 

By KELLY GILBERT 
Staff Writer 

WIth an hour's worth of political 
rhetoric-and uncapitalized words that 
came remarkably close to standard 
AIM lingo, Chancellor Marye Anne 
Fox met studen ts online in an effort 
to present herself as an accessible, 
down-to-earth administrator con-
cerned with the needs of students. 
And, for the most part, it worked. 

Hosting the Sept. 29 chat was, of 
course, a highly political move and 
Fox's conversation stayed, for the 
most part, tOO polished and profes-
sional to make many concrete state-
ments, The new chancellor man-
aged, however, to reveal aspects of 
her personality beyond what would 
show in an office setting, which is a 
worthwhile goal, even if it was only 
for the sake of making students feel 
more comfortable in approaching 
her. 

During the chat, Fox empha-
sized her excitement to interact 
with students - several times, she 

named greeting students at 
Welcome Week her favorite aspect 
of het job thus far. She politely 
declined to comment on her politi-
cal affiliation - which was boring, 
but appropriate given the setting. 
She expanded on the chancellor-as-
dictator image by mentioning her 
dedication to her research, and also 
going into slight detail about her 
children and grandchildren. 

She revealed a sense of humor: 
When asked, "Would you ever 
learn to surf?" she responded, "Yes, 
didn't you see me on a sltateboard 
in the GUIlrdian?" She took. another 
similar comment in stride when a 
student, aIiased as "beerbelly," 
demanded, "How do you expect me 
to get down to 1J without the 
Triton Taxi?" by responding calm-
ly, "A.S. has created a Safe Ride 
program. Contact your student 
government about the program," 

She endeared herself to UCSD 
students with her admission that, 
yes, she does in fact pay for her park-
ing space - there, at least, is one 

thing we all sort of have in common. 
(Of course, when you're making 
$350,000 a year, 5500 or so bucks for 
parking is barely spare change. But 
it's the thought that counts.) 

" ... The online chat ... 
strongly suggested that 
students are invited to 
playa role, however 
ken 'p' " to ,En OXS term. ... 
A transcript of the chat can be 

found at bttp:llucsdnnvs.ucsd.tdu. 
You can bet, naturally, that the 

entire conversation was primariIy a 
publicity stunt; there was little said 
during the chat that could possibly 
serve as fodder for any son of positive 
change on campus. Fox used severa.I 
practiced and oh-so-safe descriptions 
of the campus and her joy to be here, 

sirniIar to those already given in vari-
ous speeches and e-mails. The words 
themselves weren't particularly edify-
ing or educational, but the concept 
behind them was, mosdy, that the 
hour served as a forum for students 
to casuaJJy interact with their new 
chanceUor. 

And, for the time being, there's 
nothing wrong with that. 

Certainly there is a time and a 
place for students to voice legitimate 
concerns to Fox and other UCSD 
officials, and there's definitely a time 
to place honesty above a politicized 
facade, but the online chat, though 
not productive in terms of policy, 
strongly suggested that students are 
invited to playa role, however token, 
in Fox's term - which is already an 
improvement over the last adminis-
tration. And t1ut's something that 
will; hopefully, aIIcn¥ students to rec-
ognize their ability to voice con-
cerns, ideas and the lib: to FOlL 

FOI herself conveyed this mes-
sage, exhorting students to involve 
themselves in improving UCSD; it 

was, arguably, the most important 
con~eyed during the duration of 
her discourse. 

"Please continue to participate 
in this type of open dialogue with 
me," Fox said. "I welcome your 
thoughts and insights into how we 
can make UCSD the best place pos-
sible for all of us to work and learn;" 

Canned message? Yeah, maybe, 
but the point's a good one: Students 
cannot expect changes if they make 
idle complaints about FOI's exorbi-
tant salary or rant about the school's 
lack of diversity without attempting 
to interact with the school's leader-
ship. And, no matter hcn¥ political, 
events such as these prove Fox 
accessible. 

Hopefully the future will find 
Fox validating that accessibility by 
taking students' ideas and feedback 
into account. If that is the case, 
then comments such as, "I always 
welcome opportunities to get to 
know and interact with students 
and everyone in the campus com-
munity" ~U cease to be diches.

My education has recently blessed me with one of those discoveries that 
serve as shining examples of why 
the pursuit of knowledge is such a 
noble and joyful endeavor. I was 
provided with a formal, academic 
way to discuss what I had always 
been aware of: the tendency of 
those with bias, partisan or ideo-
logical, to only hear what they 
want to hear. I always referred to 
this phenomenon as one's "filter" 
- the strainer that aU knowledge 
goes through so it conforms nicely_ 
to one's ideological outlook and 
worldview. One: day, in a swelter-
ing classroom during summer ses-
sion, a professor informed me that 
there is a political science term for 
this: the "perceptual screen." 

As the professor elucidated the 
nature of the perceptual screen, I 
could feel my blood temperature 
rising and words longing to be 
uttered rising in my throat. His 
description was amusing and clear: 
We consciously and subconscious-
ly block out undesirable informa-
tion that conflicts with our ideo-
logical and partisan beliefs, just as 
"Star Trek" defense shields protect 
against undesirable photon torpe-
does. If the information does make 
it past the shield, the screen inter-
prets it in a way that strips it of 
legitimacy. I was impelled to raise 
my hand simply to say, as if anyone 

really cared to hear, that I just 
thought this was horrible - that I 
was acutely aware of the eDstence 
of the perceptual screen and that 
the worse pan was I knew I had 
one myself, and 6nd myself in 
constant conflict without it. 

"Perceptual screen" is basical-
ly a fancy name for one of the 
most unfortunate aspects of 
manlcind. Knowledge for knowl-
edge's sake - the quest for infor-
mation purely to discover the 
nature of one's reality - is a con-

" 

are many examples nonetheless 
of the extreme dangers of our 
perceptual screens. Case in point: 
Perhaps President George W. 
Bush's main shortCOming is not 
an extreme elitist strain or a will-
ingness to lie or distort evidence, 
but a Teflon-coated perceptional 
screen that caused him to disre-
gard evidence contrary to the 
idea that Iraq had weapons of 
mass destruction. This led to 
what is probably an unnecessary 
(if not immoral) war, one that 

cept that has his-
torically been rel-
egated to the few. 
People have an 
instinctive need to 
believe in certain 
things and hold a 
few rock-hard 
convictions. This 
is natural and 
understandable -
we all need to 
believe in some-
thing. 

But when 
belief crea tes 

The attempt to digest 
information in an 

honest and untainted 
way is one of the 
most important 

contributions that an 
individual can make 

Americans will be 
paying for dearly 
for generations to 
come and 
maybe all because 
the president 
could not see past 
his perceptual 
screen, knowing 
only the black and 
white view of the 
world he believed 
in. This charac-
teristic of our cur-
rent president 
greatly impairs 
his judgment; 
even if his devo-
tion to his convic-

blindness to the 
point of ideologi-
cal demagoguery, 

to a society. " 
and when people stop trying to 
balance their perceptions with 
pure information, it cannot help 
but make me regret that our cul-
ture teaches us to pursue truth and 
information not fer its own sake, 
but for the reinforcement of our 
beliefs. 

1t:1!lJl y might think tha t this is 
just th~ way people are, the , way 
they WlU always be, and that it 
contributes to the diversity of 
opinion. 

This may be true, But there 

tions are admirable, it is not 
always beneficial. 

On the other side of the spec-
trum, there are figures like author 
and filmmaker Michael Moore, 
people who will not accept the 
possibility that they are wrong, 
even when presented with evi-
dence to the contrary. Moore 
serves an important role in the 
~etal process by providing pas-
sionate criticism and opposition 
to the status quo, but he does so in 
a way almost totally devoid of crit-

ical thought and designed to 
appeal to the simpler, primitive 
nature of humanity, In doing so, 
he may further his cause, but not 
without making the American 
populace collectively more shal-
low and simple-minded along the 
way. 

The attempt to digest informa-
tion in an honest and untainted 
way is one of the most important 
contributions that an indi vidual 
can mak.e to a society. 
Unfortunately, our culture shows 
no sign of moving in that direc-
tion. Studies show that the pro-
portion of true independents there 
are in this country (as opposed to 
how many simply say they are 
inqependenr while voting the · 
same as partisans) bas remained 
virtually the same. And thus it has 
probably been throughout all his-
tory. 

I have no grand dreams for 
humanity, and things will most 
likely continue as they have. After 
all, people should always have 
beliefs and hold fundamental val-
ues. IIcn¥eve~ such things do not 
have to dictate the digestion of any 
and all information. They are 
guidelines of how to live one's life, 
but they should not be traffic cops 
regulating what one is allowed to 
see and think. The pursuit of 
knowledge and truth for its own 
sake, and the discoveries it can 
yield, are worth a thousand clever 
documentary films or stump 
speeches reinforcing what you 
already are programmed to 
believe. 

Let's have a repartee. E-mail

~ents, and lobbying efforts against 
It have been marginally effective 
in the past. While textbook pub-
lishers such as Thomson Learning 
have either ignored CALPIRG's 
cries entirely or flat-out lied to 
the loudest group at UCLA, the 
recent success with 
Schwarzenegger shows that the 
governor's office is at least some-
what sympathetic to public inter-
est groups. 

So what seems like a better use 
of CALPIRG's time and resources? 
A nasty battle with unaccountable 
entities over 5300 to 5500 per Stu-
dent, or a slightly less nasty battle 
with a publicly accountable entity 
for upwards of 5700 per student, 
depending on which student fees 
are contested? 

Regardless, CALPIRG's will-
ingness to single-handedly tak.e on 
the textbook publishing industry 
for their pricing practices is 
undoubtedly noble, and if they 
keep the pressure on, there is a 
decent chance that eventually some 
results wiJJ be seen. 

Until then, students still have 
options when dealing With rising 
textbook prices. Old editions can 
miraculously transform into new 
editions with 55 worth of photo-
copies. Friends overseas are usually 
willing to pick up international edi-
tions for a small bribe. And, if all 
else fails, textbook delivery trucks 
are notoriously top heavy, making 
them easy to hijack. 

The pressure is OFF.

Physicist: Award praises national service 
coruinued from page I 

used in creating microscopic 
devices. 

"The future is going to be in the 
area of nanotechnology," said dean 
of UCSD's division of physical sci-
ences Mark Thiemens, a one-time 
winner of the E.O Lawrence award 
himself. Thiemens said that 
Schuller's work is crucial to the 
future of technology in creating 
mechanisms that become increas-
ingly smaller. 

Casey Miller, a campus postdoc-
toral fellow and Schuller's col-
league, said the professor possesses 
a "critical eye for detail." 

"All of the computers of today 
and tomorrow have fundamental 
pieces that were researched by 
Ivan," Miller stated in an e-mail. 

Schuller, who is currently con-
ducting research at the Belgium 
Academy in Europe, said the honor 
was unexpected. 

"I was certainly lucky to get this, .. 
Schuller stated in an e-mail. "This 

was quite a surprise since there are 
many other people who have done 
quite a bit of work in ~y areas 
which are perhaps more important." 

In addition to his work with 
younger scientists,. Miller ako 
praised Schuller's research. 

"I van is a visionary, a great men-
tor ... but above all, he is quite sim-
ply one of the greatest scientific 
researchers of today," Miller said. 

Though Schuller has instructed 
at UCSD since 1987, he has also 
performed research at the Argonne 
National Laboratory and has taught 
at campuses around the world. 

This year, Schuller joined six 
other recipients of the award in other 
fields, live of whom also work for the 
University of California. The D.O.E. 
established the award in 1959. 

For her work in identifying c~­
acteristics of HIV and developing a 
new database on the virus, Los 
Alamos National Laboratory 
researcher Bette Korber received 
the department's award in the cate-

gory of life sciences. 
In addition, the department rec-

ognized two other scientists at the 
UC-run lab. Fred Mortensen, who 
researched safety and reliability of 
nuclear-weapon designs, received 
the award in the national security 
category. In environmental science, 
Gregory Swift was recognized for 
his research and design of engines 
powered by sound. 

UC Santa Cruz astronomy and 
astrophysics professor Claire Max 
received the physics award for her 
work in "laser guide star adaptive 
optics." The technology has helped 
astronomers correct blurred tele-
scopic images caused by light in the 
atmosphere. 

Richard Saykally, a UC 
Berkeley chemistry professor, was 
also to be honored for inventing 
new methods of studying the struc-
ture of special molecular ions.

Review: Study urges service requirement 
continued from page r 

students. 
UC administrators expressed 

worry over the proposal. 
"We are concerned that [the 

plan], whic" proposes that Cal 
Grants be converted to fee waivers, 
may have significant unintended 
consequences for undergraduate stu-
dent access to the university," said 
UC Provost and Senior Vice 
President for A~ademic Affairs 
M.R.e. Greenwood. 

If adopted, the process would 
eliminate a substantial role of the 
California Student Aid Commission, 
the state's principal provider of grant 
aid for postsecondary students. 
CSAC's function of detenniRing a 
student's financial eligibility and 
other criteria are "duplicative and 
unnecessary," the report stated, since 
higher education institutions are 
required to complete a similar analy-

sis for students. 
"These proposals, rather than 

blowing up a box, would only serve 
to torpedo college access and 
affordability to California's middJe-
and low-income students," CSAC 
Executive Director Diana Michel-
Fuentes said in a statement 
responding to the. report. 

The report also suggests consoli-
dating four higher education entities 
into a single division in the state's 
exeCutive branch. The California 
Community College Chancellor's 
Office, the California Postsecondary 
Education Conunission, CSAC and 
the Bureau for Private Postsecondary 
and Vocational Education would be 
combined into a department under 
an appointed deputy secretary of 
education. The move would save 
S 1.5 million in the first year. 

Opponf'nts of the measure have 
already spoken out strongly against 

the proposal. 
The move would politicize 

important education and policy 
decisions that affect nearly three 
million Californians, California 
Community College Chancellor 
Mark Drummond said in a state-
ment responding to the CPR sug-
gestions. 

Despite their objections, both 
Dnunmond and Welinsky believe 
many of the CPR recommendations 
merit further consideration. 

Other proposals in the report 
call for givin'g community colleges 
new authority to award bachelor's 
degrees, in addition to requiring 16 
hours of community service for all 
students attendihg Caljfornia's 
public colleges and universities in 
order to graduate.

tions in evolution, to analyze pro-
tein and cellular functions and to 
engineer proteins in ways that were 
impossible before," Wang said. 
"We are using this approach to bet-
ter understand disease mechanisms 
and to make the next generation of 
protein drugs with enhanced effi-
ciency." 

As an undergnduate student at 
the California Institute of 
Technology, Belongie developed 
new computer-based techniques 
for conducting fingerprint analysis. 
Currently, he is applying comput-
er-vision techniques to monitor the 
health of lab animals. Funded by 
the UCSD division of the 
California Institute for 
Telecommunications and 
Information Technology (Cal-
IT2), this "smart vivariun" animal 
laboratory project could lead to 
new medical technologies. 

"The goal of the smart vivarium 
project is to equip the cages of lab 
animals with cameras and other 
sensors to provide continuous 
monitoring of animal behavior," 
Belongie said. "This will result in 
an improved life history for the ani-
mals used in medical research and 
will make new scientific discoveries 
possible." 

Belongie joined the faculty of 
Jacobs School of Engineering in 
200 I after co-founding Digital 
Persona, a leading company that 

specializes in computer-based fin-
gerprint authentication. 

"By going after top-notch 
young faculty and offering faculty 
and students the chance to work on 
important research projects, 
UCSD, the Jacobs School of 
Engineering and Cal-IT2 are all 
laying the foundation for future 
successes and distinctions for 
young - as well as senior -

.researchers here," UCSD 
spokesman Doug Ramsey said. 

An elite panel of judges, which 
included senior-level executives 
from Cambridge University and 
top technology companies like 
IBM and Hewlett-Packard, select-
ed the finalists included on this 
year's list. Seventy-;even of the 
winners are based in the United 
States, and 24 are from California. 

"My mom passed along the news 
to all my relatives in Argentina, and 
the flood of e-mail I've gotten from 
them since then has made me feel 
like a celebrity," Belongie said. "My 
hope is that this award will increase 
my visibility and lead to more 
opportunities for research collabo-
rations and funding." 

Belongie, Link and Wang were 
recognized for their achievements 
at Technology Review's Emerging 
Technologies Conference at MIT 
on Sept. 29 and Sept. 30.

Unearthing exotic locales

yet exhilarating travel options. 

Udon Thani, ThaiImd 
Thinking of exploring the sur-

real beauty of Thailand? Beyond 
the popular tourist attraetion and 
capital of Bangkol(, Thailand 

offers many other interesting and 
untouched cities. Udon Thani, a 
province in northeastern 
Thailand, is a perfect place to see 
Thailand in its narural state. 

Udon Thani is welcoming 
from the minute you touch down 
on the runway. A train ride or 
short connecting flight from 
Bangkok takes you to Udon 
Thani, where you are greeted at 
the airpon with leis as a compli-
mentary welcome gift. From the 

CAIuIIIIJ II JInI 1M 
... beIcMs: Sapphire blue waters, stunning panoramas, \\ttite sands and 
gently crashing waYeS rombine to create the majestic beauty of Biotan, Indonesia. 

airpon you can hire a "Skycab" to 
get into town. Skycabs are the 
major form of transportation in 
Udon Thani. Like a taxi cab, a 
S\:ycab can be hailed on any street 
side. It is an open-air vehicle, best 
described as a tricycle-motorcycle. 
The fare is cheap and negotiable. 

In fact, almost every price in 
the province is negotiable, espe-
cially in the malls. Instead of the 
franchise stores abundant in 
America, Udon Thani malls are 
separated into vendor areas, with 
private individuals selling every-
thing from clothes to food to elec-
tronics. Everything is cheap, and 
the temptation to buy aT-shin 
with the Coca-Cola logo in Thai 
or famous Thai boxing shorts is 
just too much to bear . 

Authentic Thai cooking is also 
a major attraction, with several 
plates of food costing you less than 
120 Thai Baht, about 53 . One of 
the most popular menu items is 
cashew chicken, which costs about 
$1. Looking for a taste of home 
instead? The "Eagle Bar" and 
"Good Everything" restaurants 
serve both Thai food and 
American-style burgers and steaks. 

What is most striking about 
Udon Thani is the friendliness of 
the local people. Though most of 
Udon Thani is barely modernized 
and many of the local people live 
in poveny, the Thai people wel-

come expatriates and American 
visitors with open arms. 

Everywhere you go, it seems 
,you are greeted by locals. Their 
hospitality and the chance to expe-
rience the rich Thai culture make 
a visit to Udan Thani unforget-
table. 

Bintan, Indonesia 
Picture yourself sipping a 

blended fruit drink, lying on a 
beach chair and taking in the 
breathtaking sights - ocean for 
miles, the sun setting over the 
South China sea and palm trees 
lining the beach. Then picture 
yourself dining on Indonesian cui-
sine and a colorful nighdife, fin-
ishing the night in your own villa . 
This is all possible on the exotic 
island of Bintan. 

Located in Indonesia, about 45 
minutes away from Singapore, 
Bintan is the perfect place for a 
relaxing beach holiday far from 
home. The largest of the 3,200 
islands in Indonesia, Bintan offers 

a beautiful getaway while al so 
playing host to various tourist 
attractions. 

The best way to get to Bintan is 
to travel to Singapore or Indonesia 
and then take a short ferry to the 
island . Various resorts offer free 
shuttle transport from the ferry to 
their own secluded section of the 
island. The island boasts many 
luxury resorts and golf, with sever-
al that fit the budget constraints of 
a UCSD student on a ttip around 
Asia. The popular resorts for stu-
dents include Bintan Lagoon 
Resort and Mana Mana Beac h 
Club. Both offer pools right next 
to the beach and a variety of enter-
tainment venues within the resort, 
including a karaoke bar and arca de 
as well as a laser tag arena and 
many amenities. One thing not to 
miss is a cheap massage on the 
beach. Many of the resorts also 
rent out villas with private pools 
and private golf cart transport that 
can turn any backpacking experi -
ence into a luxury vacation. 

Water spons - including 
wakeboarding, banana boating and 
jet skiing - are a major attraction 
and each resort has the equipment 
necessary to participate. If you'd 
prefer to see some of Bintan's nat-
ural beauty, you can choose to 
explore a pineapple plantation or

D[R~NK rANK ~ I CROSSWORD 
Caipirinha 

A caipirinha is a traditional Brazilian drink that combines local fla-
vors of hme and cachaca. Caipirinhas have long been a drink of choice 
in Latin America, but have gained popularity from Miami to Los 
Angeles for their amazing taste and potency. The mixture of lime and 
sugar completely masks the taste of the alcohol. Beware the deceptive 
taste: This delicious drink is very strong and may have you and your 
guests dancing the samba. Caipirinhas call for cachaca, which is a 
Brazilian sugar cane liquor. If you don't have any cachaca on hand, you 
can create a close approximation by mixing equal partS silver tequila 
Oike Sauza) and light rum (such as Bacardi). If you have no rum or 
tequila, you need to restock your bar. But in the meantime, you can 
substitute vodka for the cachaca, using a good vodh like Absolut or 
Skyy. Popov will not do the job. If you are liaving a party, make a pitch-
er of caipirinhas by simply multiplying the recipe by the number of 
people. 

INGREDIENTS 

- Compiled by Masha Day 
Staff writer 

I lime (or a tangerine for a sweeter twist) 
2 shots cachaca (or equal parts silver tequila and fight rum) 
2 teaspoons sugar (you can add more or less to taste) . 
Ice 

DIRECTIONS 
1. Roll lime on cutting board to loosen the juices.

Travel: Go to Bali for the 
breezy beaches and hot nights 

comil\W!d from page 9 
check out the plentiful mangrove 
swamps that line the island. 

The best thing about Bintan is 
its tropical weather. Bintan's loca-
tion just above the equator makes 
it hot and humid all year round, 
thus making any month a perfect 
month to visit the island. 

Bali, Indonesia 

Bali, one of the most pic-
turesque islands in Southeast Asia, 
is the ideal place for relaxing and 
partying alike. With no official 
legal drinking' age, You can spend · 
late nights at the club and long 
days at the beach. 

You can fly directly into Bali 
without stopping at any of the 
neighboring cities. Most hotels 
include airport transportation in 
their room rental package, and a 
chartered van can pick you up and 
take you to your resort. As with 
Bintan, villa rental in Bali is an 
attractive option for students. 
Rentals can start as low as $250 a 
night for a four-person villa. 

The villas at Bali Dyana Villas 
(http://ww"W.blz/idYII .. IlVillllf.Com ) 
have attractive packages for student 
travelers, including airport pick up, 
welcome drinks and flowers, taxis, 
free laundry, a free massage and 
daily breakfast. Unlike other hotels 
you may have stayed at, these villas 
provide the comfort of home with 

the I uxury of a five-star hotel. F uIl-
time maids cook breakfast for no 
extra charge, and · the villa also 
includes its own private swimming 
pool and free video and Playstation 
game rental. 

Besides loupging around the 
beach and body surfing, you can 
also get manicures and pedicures 
at your beach chair for about $6. 
If you are looking for something a 
little more adventurous, many 
hotels also have motorbike rentals 
for the entirety of your stay for 
about 12,000 rupiah ($1.30). 

A nighttime visit to South Bali's 
busiest streets, Kuta and Legian, 
will show you just how busy and 
exciting Bali's nightlife and enter-
tainment can be. A cheap cab ride 
(be sure to hail a cab with a meter 
to ensure a good price) will take 
you into the heart of Bali's nightlife 
and also make Bali's modernization 
more apparent - the street 
includes many American franchises,_ 
one being Dunkin' Donuts. Stores 
and bars line the bustling street. 
Visitors should be sure to drop by 
"The Bounty One," a bar which is 
shaped like a pirate ship, with staff 
dressed like sailors and pirates. It 
has many happy hours throughout 
the day, and at night fills up its large 
dance floor as one of the most pop-
ular bars in the district.

Votergasm: 
Site promises 

parties on 
election night 

concinwd from page 9 
vote and take the pledge, find the 
polling place on Nov. 2 and wear 
the Votergasm pledge card, vote, 
meet a fellow pledge-taker at an 
election-night Votergasm party, get 
to know each other, head home 
together, fulfill the pledge. In the 
meantime, election officials tally 
votes, the election ends and your 
duty to the country is fulfilled. 

Revelle sophomore Brian 
Poladian found the Web site to be 
surprisinglyentenaining. 

"I usually find that conventional 
forms of communication about 
voting issues and processes are 
quite boring and seldom hold my 
interest, and as such, hinder my 
eagerness to exercise my rights as 
an American citizen and become 
involved in politics," Poladian said. 
"Although Votergasm employs sex-
ual overtones, it is one of the most 
creative and interesting ways I've 
found to increase awareness about 
politics and promote interest in the 
upcoming election." 

New topics appear faster than a 
user's refresh rate on the 
Votergasm.org forum, where such 
topics as "Kerry and Star Trek," 
"Lick Kerry, Not Bush," "Kerry = 
Stalin" and "Bush z Hitler" are dis-
cussed by newbies and aficionados 
alike. There is even an "interactive 
stereotyping game, "·which involves 
looking at pictures of voters and 
determining whether they are an 
"ass" or a "trunk" (Democrat or 
Republican, respectively). It is a 
political version of Hotornot.com, 
where discerning eyes check to see 
if their "partisan-der" i .. up to par. ' ... 

Votergasm.org provides access 
to the locations and themes of the 
Votergasm election-night parties 
going on in your area. Not only is 
information about the parties post-
ed, this portion of the Web site 
gives voting participants the ability 
to publicize and host their own 
parties. Three prominent Southern 
California parties include the "Frat 
Boy Fuckfest" in Los Angeles, the 
"We're Gonna Get 'Screwed' if We 
Vote Kerry" party in Beverly Hills 
and the "Don't Fuck Nonvoters" 
potluck in San Diego. 

"As a pledging voter, 1 plan to 
be as selective in the bedroom as 1 
am on the ballot," Earl Warren 
College junior Andrew Powell said. 
"Living in this decidedly 
Democratic-voting state of 
California, young people are tired 
of hearing about the old dogma of 
how much their one vote matters. 
To the individual, this Web site is 
not so much about making a politi-
cal difference, but rather making 
our vote pan of a recreational 
activity we all enjoy. And in the 
masses to which this appeals lies 
our persuasive power." 

The site accepts donations 
toward the cause and jokingly 
threatens, "If you think sex is 
expensive, try abstinence. And if 
you think democracy is expensive, 
try a dictatorship. A dictatorship 
that prohibits sex." To the individ-
uals involved with the program, 
"Votergasm.org is more than a 
Web site. It is more than an idea. It 
is a movement."

MONDAY, OCTOBER .. , 2004 

Water polo: 
Triton victory 

is seventh 
straight 

continued from page 20 
two early goals . Senior Nate 
Cooper and freshman Adnan 
Jerkovic retaliated for UCSD, 
throwing back one goal apiece to 
recapture a 4-3 lead going into 
the second half. 

UC Davis' Jacobson issued his 
third goal of the game for one of 
the Aggies' two scores early in the 
third period to give them a 5-4 lead 
with 3 minutes, II seconds remain-
ing in the period. With only 2:05 
showing on the game clock, 
Budnick scored his second of the 
game to knot the contest at five 
through the remainder of the third 
period_ 

Fatigue and tight defense 
weighed heavily against both 
teams' offenses in the final period. 
Finegold's goal with 3:50 on the 
game clock turned out to be the 
difference in the final score, but the 
victory belonged in large part to 
junior goalie Colin McElroy, who 
collected seven saves in the game. 
His last save came with less than 10 
seconds remaining in the fourth 
quarter, as UC Davis' Conor 
Duignan took a shot from point-
blank range at the Triton cage. 
McElroy blocked the attempt, 
securing the Triton win. 

UCSD showed a definite 
strength in its ability to draw ejec-
tions against its opponents and to 
use those man-up opporrunities 
effectively. The Tritons capitalized 
on four sill-on-five advantages in 
the game, while the Aggies only 
converted two of their three 
chances. 

The Tritons were back in 
action on Oct. 2 and Oct. 3 at the 
NorCal Tournament hosted by 
the University of Pacific in 
Stockton, Calif. Results from the 
tournament were not available at 
press time.

continued {Tum page 20 

UCSD stepped up to the task 
and finished their opportunities 
against San Francisco State. 

The Gators struck the first 
blow with a goal in the 10th 
minute of the first half. 

"We weren't ready for' the 
Gators' physical play," junior mid-
fielder and captain Matthew Davey 
said_ "We weren't ready to play 
aggressive soccer, and they caught 
us off guard." 

The Tritons responded with two 
unanswered goals in the second half. 
Davey scored from seven yards out, 
with an assist from sophomore for-
ward Brian Jacobs. 

"[Jacobs) did really well to get by 
his guy and put a pretty good cross 
in," Davey said. "I think it was just 
good timing, and we've been \Vork-
ing on that all week long. " 

With less than four minutes left 
in the match, junior forwud Jon 
Krupansky kicked in the game-win-
ner with assisu from freshman 
defender Josh Levy and sophomore 
midfielder German Bravo. 

Annstrong was pleased with his 
team's efforts but knows that the 
Tritons must continue to improve_ 

"We're probably functioning at 
about 80 percent of what we can 
do," Armstrong said. "We're not 
where we want to be but I'm hop-
ing that very soon, we'll start 
pulling it together." 

MONDAY, OCTOBER .. , ZOO4 

Volleyball: Win maintains 
perfect 5 .. 0 CCAA record 

conlinwd from page 20 
kill to win the second game. 

Down two games, Cal Poly 
Pomona desperately tried to snatch 
game three from the Tritons. It 
came close at 26-23, but UCSD did 
not falter as WIlson clinched the 
victory with a kill to complete the 
sweep. 

"We realized we were in for 
more of a battle," McFuland said. 
"But I couple of calls against 
Teresa's seu got her fired up, and 
Kendra also got fired up, and they 
led the chuge. Teresa attacked sill 
times and got five kills with no 
errors." 

Another Triton playing an 
imponant role was freslunan Iibero 

Natalie Facchini, who has provided 
solid defense for the Tritons thus &C. 

"She had 18 digs, almost twice as 
many as any other [UCSDI player," 
McFuland said. "She has done a 
good job for USi she has a good 
defense and passes very well." 

UCSD returns bome to face 
Sonoma State for the first of two 
matches this season. Last year, the 
Tritons took the regulu season 
series, sweeping the Seawolves in 
both matchups. McFarland's team 
will be looking to stop Sonoma 
State's Erin Manly ~nd Megan 
Dierker, who each registered dou-
ble digiu in kills against UCSD. 
The teams will face off on Oct. 8 at 
RlMAC Arena beginning at 7 p.m. 

McManus: Former players 
celebrate coach's milestone 

continued from page 20 
San Francisco State proved to 

be a tough opponent for the 
Tritons, with the Gators' goalie, 
Erin Clark making several key 
saves against UCSD. She led the 
way in forcing the Tritons to steal 
the win in double overtime. 

"We came out off a big win 
against Sonoma," Dickey said. 
"There was a lot of pressure for 
our coach to have us step up and 
play. When the game ended in 
regulation, we were still 0-0. It put 
a little more intepsity in it, and 
made us realize what we had to do, 
if not for ourselves then for our 
coach." 

The Tritons stepped up and 
handed their coach his milestone. 

McManus knew the pressure 

was on his team to pull through and 
win at home. 

"I'm glad we got it at the first 
attempt, " McManus said. 
"Otherwise, it becomes a big mon-
key on your back- I thought it was 
an ugly game, San Francisco is 
always tough_ They battle like heD. 
I th~ught the girls did weD, we hung 
in." 

After the win, the Tritons sur-
rounded McManus, congrarulat-
ing him, and dUll}ped water from 
the cooler on his back- The crowd 
also stood up and celebrated his 
milestone, including former play-
ers 'Christine Wensel and Megan 
Mendoza from the class of 2004. 

In his 18 years of coaching, 
McManus holds a 300-36-20 over-
aD record.

Dominguez Hills, Pomona Tritons resist Seawolves for first time since move to Division ill

Unlike most of its opponents, the 
No. 16 UCSD men's soccer team 
starts its regular season a few weeks 
before classes begin. And every sea-
son that the Tritons play during 
week one, head coach Derek 
Am1strong encourages his players to 
keep their concentration and be 
aware of off-field distractions. 

"Every year, T always warn [the 
players I that the first week is tough 
becau e they are balancing school 
and soccer," Armstrong said. "But 
after that, they're adjusted." 

After struggling for a scoreless 
tie against Sonoma State on Oct. 1 
at RIMAe fi eld, the Tritons won, 
2-1, ag-ainst visiting San Francisco 
State on Oct. 3. It was a huge win 
because the Gators had beaten the 

eawolves ea rlier in the season. 
EvCll though the match against 

onoma Statc was mostly even, 
tllC Tritons fai led to capitalize on 
scvera I chanccs. 

"\Ye were definitely strong 
defenSively," senior defender Luke 
Rus ell sa id. "But we didn't put away 
our ch:mce . We should have won, 
3-0, ,l lld it's frustrating. We had 
three or four breakaway chances, 
and we didn't give up any goals." 

Armstrong echoed Russe ll 's 
sentiments, al 0 noting that the 
Seawolves have been a thorn in his 
side duri ng his coaching career. 

"1 can't beat [Sonoma State]," 
Armstrong sa id. "This is the $ixth 
time [without a win]. " 

Although the tie was frustrating 
for UCSD, Russell knows the team 
is still in good standing. 

"We're looking to come out 
strong [in the next match]," Russell 
sa id. "We just need to finish ."

DUnsmore, Ohta, Wilson and Crandell 
lead charge as Tritons smother opponents 
By CYNIHIA BLADE CHAVEZ

Consistency has been the theme 

for the No.2 UCSD women's vol-
leyball team thus far. As evidenced 
by UCSD's 1 7 -1 record, head 
coach Duncan McFarland can 
count on his starters to step up to 
the task in any given game. 

Guided by senior setter Teresa 
Ohta's 93 total assists, the Triton 
starters feasted on opponents Cal 
State Dominguez Hills and Cal Poly 
Pomona on Oct. 1 and Oct. 2. 
Against host Cal State Dominguez 
Hills, UCSD dominated the Toros 
in three games, 
30-19, 30-23, 
30-21. The 
Tritons hit .476, 
with three play-
ers recording 
kills in double 
digits: senior 
outside hitter 
Stacy Dunsmore 
(J 4), senior out-
side hitter 
Bonnie Wilson 
(1 1) and junior 
outside hitter 

Triton women's 
volleyball senior 

setter 

Lindsay Crandell (10). Wilson and 
Ohta also added 11 and seven digs, 
respectively. 

"Our offense was working very 
well," McFarland said. "We passed 
a little bit better than normal; 
Teresa had a consistent passing 
game which really got our offense 
fired up. In our third game, we hit 
.576, which is extremely good." 

Although the Tritons swept the 
match, they had to contain the 
Toros' middle blockers, Keesha 
Aldridge and Vivian Maxie. Aldrige 
tied Dunsmore in kills, with 14, 

followed by Maxie with nine. 
"Cal Sate Dominguez Hills has 

a couple of good middle attackers," 
McFarland said. "[Aldridge and 
Maxie] are tall and very athletic; 
these two attackers were consis-
tently effective against us." 

But UCSD's solid passihg and 
attacking proved to be too, much 
for the Toros, who dropped to 9-7 
overall with the loss. 

UCSD traveled to Cal Poly 
Pomona to conclude its brief two-
game road trip where the Broncos 
(11-7) were hoping to end a spell of 
six straight losses to its Califomiil 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
opponent. But the Tritons continued 
to have the Broncos' nwnber, sweep-
ing them in a thriller, 30-19,33-31, 
30-24. Wilson and Canape con-
tributed 14 and 10 kills, respectively, 
while Ohta registered 47 assists. 

Cal Poly Pomona juniors 
Allison Anderson and Kellie 
Francis each added 12 kills while 
freshman setter Emily Kennedy 
had 34 assists in the losing effon. 

Repeating its performance from 
the previous match, UCSD came 
out strong, winning the first game 
easily. 

"In the first game, I felt like we 
were in control," McFarland said. 
"We were serving tough, passing 
well, and we hit .500." 

But Cal Poly Pomona, deter-
mined to break its losing streak, 
rallied back in the second game to 
save four game pomts. Francis, who 
peppered UCSD with six kills in 
game two, led the Broncos' rome-
bacJc attempt. However, the Tritons 
capitalized on poor passing by the 
Broncos, and Crandell notched a
