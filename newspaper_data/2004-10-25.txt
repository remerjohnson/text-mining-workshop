Panda to offer vegetarian dishes Nearly half of A.S. 
senators now appointed

Price Center eatery Panda 
Express has promised to make its 
vegetable dishes suitable for vege-
tarians by replacing its current 
chicken-based sauce with a veg-
etable-based one, according to. 
University Centers Director Gary 
Ratcliffe. 

The change has come in 
response to a letter sent by the 
University Centers Advisory 
Board to ~anda Expres!> officials 
last week, expressing frustration 
over the restaurant's lack of veg.: 
etarian dishes and failure to 
clearly indicate that the eatery's 
vegetable dishes are unsuitable 
for those following a vegetarian 
diet. 

The Chinese food establish-
ment, which is ranked second 
among all restaurants in Price 
Center for sales, offers "mixed 
vegetables" and "eggplant with 
tofu," both of which contain no 
pieces of meat, but are cooked in a 
chicken-base. No sign advises cus-
tomers of this. 

Ratcliffe said he had received

assurances that the vegetable 
sauce would be changed, but he 
did not know whether or not the 
sauce for "eggplant with tofu" 
would be as well. 

"I want to get all the specifics," 
Ratcliffe said. "I Want to know 
everything that is going to be 
cooked with that vegetable stock." 

UCAB had been working with 

Ratcliffe in an effon to get Panda 
Express to offer a real vegetarian 
dish or to put up signs advising 
customers of the food preparation 
methods.

In the opening weeks of the aca-
demic year, the A.S. Council has 
lost three of its elected senators. 
After the resignations of Eleanor 
Roosevelt ColJege Sophomore 
Senator ArieJle Maccio, Revelle 
College Junior Senator AshJey 
A1uisi and Sixth College 
Sophomore Senator Enrique Soto, 
the council now consists of just 13 
elected senators, with 11 positions 
appointed or awaiting appoint-
ment. 

AU three of the senators, as welJ 
as the appointed John Muir 
Coijege Senior Senator Jeremy 
Cogan, who also resigned, cited 
personal reasons for their depar-
ture. 

Marshall College Senior 
Senator and Senate Chair Kate 
Pill on and other members of the 
council have expressed respect for 
the four departing members of the 
council and their need to repriori-

tize various commiunents. 
These resignations, however, 

mean that out of the 24 senators 
who hold voting positions on the 
A.S. Council, the student body 
only elected 13. 

Pillon has echoed concerns 
from other councilmembcrs that 
almost half of the student represen-
tatives are not elected and aid that 
"the voice [of the tudents] is not a 
pure as if they were elected." 

Pillon, however, said that the 
appointment of a senator does 
not necessarily have a negative 
effect. 

"Even the appointed [senators] 
take students' needs into effect," 
she said. "Freshman senators are 
often the most dedicated to their 
constituents." 

A.S. President Jenn Pae sajd 
that though senatorial appoint-
ments may present chalJeges, many

Forced sexual assaults on cam-

pus and in its vicinity have 
increased, from three in 2002 to 
nine in 2003, according to the 
annual Clery crime report in 
October by the campus police 
deparanent. 

During the same time period, 
assaults reponed only to the 
UCSD Police Depamnent have 
doubled from three reponed cases 
in 2002 to six cases in 2003. The 
campus police reponed no rapes in 
2003 - a separate offense for sta-
tistical purposes - down from one 
in the year before. 

Although the reported number 

of forced sexual assaults has posted 
a noticeable increase, UCSD 
Police Department Detective 
Sergeant Roben Jones said the 
numbers might not tell the whole 
story. 

"Out of the six [sexual assaults], 
five of them were sexual batteries 
and didn't amount to rape in the 
sense that everyone thinks of it," 
Jones said. 

For reporting purposes, officers 
define forced sexual offense as 
crimes that include all sexual acts 
directed at another person without 
his or her consent. These offenses 
include sexual intercourse and oral 
copulation, sexual battery and

Faculty experts now have the 
ability to giVe interviews live on 
news stations across the globe from 
a studio on campus as part of 
UCSD's new Experts on Demand 
service. 

Though it has weathered recent 
budget cuts, the university said fund 
reallocations and savings through 
the use of current UCSD-TV 
equipment have allowed it to create 
the service, which debuted on Oct. 
8. 

The university began the pro-
gram, and the associated studio at 

UCSD-1V, to gain a wider audi-
ence for f.aculty ideas, according to 
University Communications. 

"Our f.aculty expertise ranks 
with anybody in the world, and we 
saw the ability to make that exper-
tise available to the public through 
the media," Vice Chancellor of 
External Relations James M. 
Langley said. "I think the most 
significant thing is that when you 
look at how often faculty are cited 
in leading scholarly joumals ... 
UCSD faculty are cited at the 
third highest rate in the country." 

Langley said he hopes that hav-
ing faculty experts on national

tional perception" ofUCSD. 
"We want people to have a 

greater awareness that UCSD has 
prominent authorities on a wide 
variety of subjects," said university 
spokesman Barry Jagoda, director 
of communications for interna-
tional relations, social sciences and 
arts and humanities. 

The studio is connected via a 
fiber optic connection to equip-
ment that transmits video to satel-
lites that news organizations use, 
aU owing the organizations to relay 
live interviews around the world 
from campus. According to Jagoda, 
this connection is leased on a year-
ly basis for approximately $15,000. 

"This is a very small sum of 
money for such a potential bene-
fit," Jagoda sajd. 

To keep costs at a minimum the 
studjo itself has been created out of 
infrastructure that aJready existed 
as part ofUCSD-TY, according to 
Experts on Demand production 
manager Elizabeth Bornheimer. 

According to Jagoda, 
University Communications and 
UCSD-TV "are adding this 
assignmel\t to their existing work 
with no additional charge." 

Despite contributions from 
"people all over the university," 
finding money to lease the equip-
ment was a challenge in tough bud-

I BRIEFLY 
Hackers may' have breached 

UC Berkeley database 
Law enforcement officials are investigating 

whether computer hackers who gained unau-
thorized access to a computer database at UC 
Berkeley successfully acquired personal infor-
mation - including social security numbers -
of more than 600,000 individuals who provide 
and receive in-home health care. 

Campus officials first announced the appar-
ent security breach, which took place in early 
September, on Oct. 20. 

At the time, a visiting scholar used the num-
bers as part of her research project to deter-
mine how wage and benefit increases could 
improve the recruitment and retention of qual-
ity home care workers. 

Campus networking and law enforcement 
officials are working in concert with the FBI and 
other state and federal authorities to determine 
how the breach occurred, according to a uni-
versity statement. 

' The investigation has not yet determined 
whether hackers acquired any personal data, 
and the state's Department of Social Services 
has reported no evidence of identity theft or 
misuse of the data. 

At the time of the inciden~ Berkeley admin-
istrators were working to institute new stan-
dards for security scheduled to go into effect in 
the spring that will deny university network 
access to all individuals without proper software 
patches, anti-virus programs and other potential 
security problems. 

UCSA beats 25,000 goal for

The UC Student Association has announced 

that it beat its goal of registering 25,000 new 
college voters by 5,000 students. 

In an attempt to target the age group with 
the lowest reported political participation, the 
organization launched the campaign to make 
students more engaged, UCSA President 
Jennifer Lilla said. 

In addition, the group is trying to increase 
voter turnout on UC campuses by 5 percent in 
the Nov. 2 election, and has planned statewide 
voter education events targeting students.

Students prefer ideal weilht 
to longer life, study findS 
College students say they're willing to cut 

short their lives if it allows them to be thin, 
according to a new survey by the Dole Nutrition 
Institute. 

Almost four in 10 respondents said they 
would be willing to die a year earlier in order to 
remain at their Ideal weight for the rest of their 
lives, though only 18 percent believe they are 
currently overweight the study found. 

However, only 22 percent said they would 
accept lower grades if it allowed them to shave 
off 10 pounds of extra weight. Eighty-four per-
cent of the students said they believed it would 
be worse to be 20 pounds overweight than to 
be $20,000 in debt. 

In addition, the study reported that college 
students do not drink as much alcohol as is 
commonly believed. Almost half of respon-
dents said they do not drink on a regular 
basis, and almost one-third said they drink five 
or fewer alcoholic beverages' in an average 
week.

I LIGHTS & SIRENS 
The number of prospective graduate inter-

national students has declined from last year at 
many of the nation's top academic institutions, 
a new joint survey by five higher education 
interest groups has found. 

The declines appear to be the largest in the. 
nation's doctoral and research institutions, and 
among the 25 research institutions that enroll 
the most international students, according to 
the study. The numbers indicate that the 
decli,le in applications is most serious for 
Chinese students. 

Though the groups stated that an analysis of 
the causes for the decrease would require a 
separate study, they have cited ·an unwelcom-
ing climate for international students· as a rea-
son for the declines. They also pointed to ·sub-
stantial anecdotal evidence" from hi~her edu-
cation institutions across the country Indicating 
that current security policies and procedures 
have had a negative impact on students, espe-
cially those studying science.

unwanted contact With "intimate 
parts," like the groin, buttocks and 
breasts. 

The technical definition of the 
violations is broad and the various 
intensities of each individual situa-
tion are different, allowing the uni-
versity to group and compare sta-
tistics with other universities across 
the nation, according to Jones. 

Jones said the number of 
reponed incidents is relatively 
low, due to the strong coopera-
tion between the campus police 
department and the Student 
Safety Awareness and Sexual -
Assault Resource Center, in addi-
tion to various other campus 
organizations. He also said that 
the area surrounding the campus 
is fairly safe, allowing the agen-
cies to better shape programs and 
cater to the school community. 

"The number of incidents of 
sexual assault that occur does not 
fluctuate that much," said Jones. 

Jones attributed the decision 
not to implement new education-
al and outreach programs to the 
low numbers, and said the 
department will work together 
with other agencies to improve 
the quality of the current ones. 

The increase in numbers of 
incidents does not necessarily 
mean an increase in rape, but 
shows that more people are will-

role since at least 2001, the most

much discrimination surrounding

crimes difficult to report and

The police department pre-
pared the repon to meet U.S . 
Department of Education regula-

tions. Under the statute Ic.nown as 
the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of 
Campus Security Policy and 
Campus Crime Statistics Act, 
national public and private univer-
sities must disclose statistics 
regarding crime on campus and its 
vicinity annually. 

The Clery repon is compiled 
of crime statistics reponed by the 
UCSD Police Department, San 
Diego Police Department, cam-
pus security authorities and 
UCSD Medical Center. The 
Clery report is different from 
other styles of statistics reporting 
in that it requires the disclosure of 
student disciplinary referrals that 
are not required by either state or 
federal law enforcement, accord-
ing to the repon briefing. 

The act is named after then-
19-year-old Lehigh University 
freshman Jeanne Ann Clery, who 
was raped and murdered in 1986 
while she was asleep in her dorm 
room. Clery's parents, in concert 
with other victims, lobbied 
Congress to pass the legislation 
after realizing the Lehigh campus 
had 38 murders in the preceding 
three years, according to nonprof-
it group Security on Campus. 

Revelle College freshman 
Tracy Ho said she is fairly pleased 
with the statistics at UCSD and 
that campus crime rates played a 
significant role when it came to 
deciding which college to attend. 
Ho said she constantly pays atten-
tion to her surroundings and that 
the matter of personal sa fety is a 
state of mind. 

"If you look lost or insecure, 
you stand out," Ho said. "But 
because I am comfonable with my 
surroundings, I don't think I will

(V-WIRE) WASHINGTON 
- A bill passed without opposition 
in the Senate and House of 
Representatives, ends the federal 
guarantee of a 9.5 percent rate of 
return to student loan lenders. 
Officials estimate $285 million in 
savings, which would provide for-
giveness for student loans for math, 
science and special education 
teachers in underprivileged 
schools. 

Congress passed the original 
legislation allowing the 9.5 per-
cent return rate about 20 years 
ago to subsidize lenders when 
interest rates were higher, said 
Jim Manley, press secretary for 
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-
Mass). Today, most students pay 
interest rates of about 3.5 percent 
on their loans. 

In 1993, legislation passed to try 
to phase out the government sub-
sidy to lenders, but some lenders 
found loopholes in the legislation 
to continue to receive federal 
funds, officials said. 

Robert Shireman, director of 
the Institute for College and 
Academic Success, said lenders 
may no longer use "cloning," or 
giving loans tax exempt status just 
long enough to qualify for the sub-
sidy. 

"Rather than being squandered, 
these funds will now provide an 
important recruiting tool for dis-
tricts in need of more teachers, 
reward teachers who commit to 
underserved populations and better 
prepare students in those class-
rooms for success in college or 
other pursuits," stated Sen. Judd 
Gregg (R-NH) , chairman of the 
Senate Committee on Health, 

Education, Labor and Pensions, in 
a press' release. 

However, Democrats and stu-
dent loan advocates said they do 
not think the new legislation is suf-
ficient. Shireman said the bill still 
allows for the "recycling" of loans 
to extend their lives. 

Manley said that Kennedy 
would like to permanently end the 
loophole when the legislation 
expires next year. 

Shireman said he estimates a 
more permanent and complete 
solution would save taxpayers $2 
billion to $3 billion. With the new 
legislation, taxpayers are paying 
$240 million per quarter. 

He also said that he believes 
the legislation is nor more com-
plete because some not-for-profit 
organizations benefit from the 
subsidy. 

Despite the opposition, officials 
said many Republicans are pleased 
with the bill in its current state. 

"President Bush was one of the 
first to propose ending the subsi-
dies as part of his 2005 budget 
proposal," stated Stephanie 
Babyak, a spokesperson for 
Secretary of Education Rod 
Paige, in an e-mail. 

In a press release, Paige said the 
legislation "was the right - and 
only - way to go to immediately 
address the problem." 

"The legislation not only closes 
the loophole, but also wisely directs 
the savings to the. nation's class-
rooms to help ensure that every 
child in America is taught by a 
highly qualified teacher, because 
we Ic.now teachers are the key to 
increased student achievement," he 
said. "I stand ready to have the V.S. 
Department of Education imple-
ment this legislative remedy as 
expeditiously as possible."

Campus television shouldn't be censored 
Committee to clarify rules should have student representation 

Iy IENJAMIN IAITLETT 
Contributing Writer 

Last week, Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Joseph w. mandated a new administra-
tive committee that will review 
content guidelines for student-run 
closed-circuit television, much to 
the dismay of many Student-Run 
Television members and the guys 
who used to play pornography on 
the Thurgood Marshall College 
television channel. 

The committee's mission is to 
"[clarify] what are the governing 
structures for the closed-circuit 
television stations and determine 
how content is governed," accord-
ing to Watson. 

One might imagine, however, 
that it is not so much a lack of clar-
ity in the rules but rather a disre-
gard for them that has led Watson 
to take action. Although the com-
mittee may be described as an 
instrument of "clarification," its 
function may well be more far-
reaching. 

It is a body designed to oversee 
and enforce previously instated 
rules and regulations - in other 
words, to potentially censor mater-
ial deemed inappropriate by the 
powers that be. 

This is not to suggest that cen-
sorship is necessarily a bad thing. 
Like many things, censorship is 

not a matter of black and white 
but of infinite shades of gray. For 
example, censorship plays an 
important role in protecting view-
ers from content that they would 
find offensive, and some mecha-
nisms must exist to protect view-
ers from such content. However, 
there is a danger that censorship 
will impede the open flow of 
ideas and knowledge. For this 
reason, one of the fundamental 
principles of this country (and 
Western society as a whole) is 
the freedom of speech. The 
question therefore is not 
whether there should 
or should not be 
censorship 
but 
rather to 
w hat 
extent, 
employed 
by whom, 
and how. 

One of the 
best things 
about our cam-
pus (no, it's not 
the amazing night 
life) is that it pro-
vides the opportunity 
for students to jump 
outside the tradi-
tional bubble of 
conscience. 
Students at 

Publishers should allow 
access to materials 

By JENNIFER WONG 
Contributing Writer 

The pending investigation of 
the University of California elec-
tronic reserves program by the 
Association of American Publishers 
has raised some interesting ques-
tions about the ethics of research 
and materials. If the work done by 
researchers and writers is made 
available to the public for free, does 
that give them less incentive to 
continue their hard work, or does it 
give students more reason to pur-
sue knowledge? 

For the writers of the articles, 
studies and excerpts that appear in 
students' $70 course readers, their 
research is their job. As we all 
know, money is a blessing if 
you've got it these days. If the 
researchers aren't getting proper 
compensation, they'll have less 
incentive to work, and the AAP 
wants them to get what's due. In a 
sense, those seemingly overpriced 
readers are researchers' and pro-
fessors' reward for conducting the 
research that enriches our lives by 
advancing science, art and the 
humanities. 

What about the needs of stu-
dents, however? EReserves is there 
for them so they can have access to 
materials without having to buy 
costly readers on top of textbooks, 
especially with student fee rates 
rising through the roof. In terms of 
money, every little hit helps college 
students and their parents. And 
while stimulating research is 
important, the money students 
save is probably more significant 
than the benefits researchers would 
reap if this investigation forces the 
university to compensate the pub-
lishers for back royalties. 

The university argues that 
under the fair use policy, they can 

distribute these materials for edu-
cational purposes in the same way 
that libraries can lend out books, 
to make intellectual materials 
available to the public. Similarly, 
the materials in these course read-
ers will probably only be used for 
one class in one quarter, and will 
prove useless afterward. Having 
free resources also encourages stu-
dents to research topics on their 
own, especially during college, 
when students are trying to broad-
en their horizons and find what 
interests them the most; this is 
probably why the fair use policy 
was implemented in the first place. 
Having information like course 
materials available online makes it 
easier for students to peruse these 
subjects and helps develop the 
Edisons and Einsteins of tomor-
row. Readers can't be sold back, so 
they will be tossed out, a waste of 
material and money. So why not 
keep them available in a means by 
which they can be used and 
"returned"? 

So far, though, it seems the 
AAP doesn't want to shut down 
the eReserves program, but rather 
get the legality of the program 
straightened out. While the issue 
seems trivial, this case could set an 
important precedent in terms of 
intellectual property. No one is 
even sure if anything illegal is 
being carried out, but if the uni-
versity is found to be at fault, then 
students all over the United States 
might soon find themselves 
coughing up a few extra 
Benjamins every quarter. 
Regardless, it seems silly for the 
AAP to come after the students 
who will eventually be writing 
texts for them, especially at a time 
when students' wallets are tighter 
than ever. 

UCSD should be encouraged 
to break molds and think in 

unique and diverse ways. 
Aher all, this is what col-

lege is ultimately all about 
- not the degree, but 

the thought and effort 
that are required to 

earn it. 
In being open 

and free in 
thought, we have 

, the right (and 
hopefully the judg-
ment) to make our 
own Jecisions 
about schvol, sex, 
drugs - and yes, 
even television. 
Indeed, there very 
well may be "inap-
propriate" material 
on university Tv, 
but aren't we, as 
discerning adults, 
able to change the 
channel? Isn't a 
quick flip of the 
remote a small price 
to pay to reserve the 
freedom of thought 
and speech on cam-
pus? 

If the new com-
mittee takes on an 
oversight roll, it will 
essentially steal this 
choice from us. We'll 

. no longer have the right to decide 
whether certain content is free 
speech or just plain offensive 
because a committee will now do 
that for us. 

For example, it was reported in 
May, that "obscene" material was 
aired at Thornton Hospital, 
although the nature of such mate-
rial remains unidentified. 
Although what was played may 
very well have been inappropriate, 
that an entity outside of UCSD 
can dictate the freedom of speech 
on campus is a step in the wrong 
direction. 

After all, what might be inap-
propriate to one is free speech to 
another. Earl Warren College 
Resident Dean Oaire Palmer, who 
has been appointed to the commit-
tee, shut down Warren College 
Television after it aired the behead-
ing of American hostage Nicholas 
Berg, a move that angered some 
students. 

Out of respect for Berg and his 
family, it's not hard to see why 
Palmer deemed such material 
offensive. As ugly as it is, however, 
the video provides a unique 
insight into what is happening in 
Iraq and the world. With elections 
so close, students should have the 
freedom to see issues outside the 
rosy interpretations of American 

... 

Typhoons wash over Yakuza 
Lost in 
Translation 

A s a UCSD freshman, I was upset with La Jolla. From what I'd been told by my 
San Diego friends and relatives, I 
would be spending the nen four 
years in a sunny paradise where 
temperatures rarely dipped below 
75. It didn't quite turn out that 
way, as I saw layers of thick fog 
roll across campus more often 
than not. When it wasn't fogged 
up, it was raining. 

But compared to the Japanese 
city of Yokohama, San Diego, 
even at its foggiest, is indeed the 
land of eternal sunshine. 

Twenty-three typhoons have 
swept through Japan this season. 
Ten of them - a postwar record 
- have rocked the main island. 
Trees have uprooted, huge waves 
have hit the shores and dozens of 
people have died. School was can-
celed last Monday because of the 
weather, something unheard of in 
San Diego, unless wildfires raging 
through East County are consid-
ered "weather." 

When typhoons hit, they flood 
the subways and train lines, 
bringing urbanized Japanese life 
to an abrupt halt. Most people 
depend on the normally efficient 
public transportation to get 
around the country; the city 
streets are narrower than 
Berkeley's and the tolls higher 
than New Jersey's, so cars, espe-
cially big ones, are lumries few 
care to indulge in. The last 
typhoon to shut down the trains 
around the Tokyo metropolis 
stranded almost 100,000 com-
muters. Thousands were forced 
to disembark at unfamiliar train 

stations, lining up for taxis to 
ferry them to hotels and bars to 
wait out the storm. 

The day of the first huge 
typhoon in our area was also the 
day of our mandatory field trip to 
Kotobulci-cho, a low-income area 
of japan's second-largest cit:y 
characterized by its population of 
day laborers, homeless and the 
Japanese mafia known as Yakuza. 
The mafia operates openly there. 
They run homeless shelters (swin-
dling the homeless out of their 
welfare checks), gambling parlors 
and other scams in Kotobulci. 

Betting on sporting events is 
illegal in Japan, but the police 
usually look the other way when 

" Most people depend an 
the normally efficient 

public transportation to 
get arOtO'Ul the country; 

the dty streets are 
TUl7TOWeT than Berkeley's 
and the toUs higher than 

New Jersey's ... " 
it comes to these shady estab- . 
lishments. Horse racing, dog 
racing. motorcar and boat racing 
are all fair game for the men sit-
ting at the tables inside. On sun-
nier days, the room will overflow 
with people, spilling out onto 
the adjacent narrow street, 
where the crowd can watch th~ 
action on four wall-mounted 
TVs, which are shuttered in 
black boxes during the 
inclement weather. 

The police doo't usually both-

er shutting these places down. 
But when an officer is up for pro-
motion, he might earn some 
points by busting up a gambling 
den or two. If someone is caught 
with a betting slip during a raid, 
he is guilty of a crime. The first 
rule of Yakuza gambling is to drop 
your betting slip as soon as the 
raid begins: no betting slip, no 
crime. 

Successful raids are rare, 
though, since the Yakuza have 
guards loolcing o'!t for police offi-
cers. , 

As we listened to our professor 
explain all this, he glanced over 
our shoulders. 

"In fact, urn, I believe there is 
one looking at us right now, actu-
ally, to make sure everything is all 
right." 

Stupidly, we all whirled around 
to see a grungy little man with a 
cigarette watching us intently. 

Yakuza! 
The next Yakuza run-in hap-

pened after our professor led us 
down another narrow alley. 

"Here, at the end of this alley-
way, is the main Yalruza office in 
Kotobuki, " the . professor 
explained. 

Yes, the mafia has its own 
office. 

We did not approach the 
Yalruza, instead turning left down 
another alley and onto the open 
road. 

"We are going to pass by the 
front of the office now," the pro-
fessor said. "We will walk by slow-
ly, but please do not stare." 

Naturally, we stared. 
The Yakuza seemed amused 

by our presence in their town. 
Rather than hiding from the 
large group of Americans, they 
leaned against the door frame 
and watched us. One young-

media. 
Furthermore, the committee 

itself has only a single student 
representative. Since UCSD tele-
vision is essentially made for stu-
dents, by students, shouldn't it 
ultimately be students who dic-
tate its content? Whether it is 
intended or not, a body constitut-
ed by the administration will 
reflect the biases of - you 
guessed it - the administration. 

This is a huge mistake and 
endangers the facility of indepen-
dent thought at UCSD. We 
should be encouraging stronger 
voices independent of the admin-
istration, not softer ones that 
adhere to it. 

Watson's interest in censoring 
university television is completely 
understandable and an oversight 

" ... a body constituted by 
the administration will 
reflect the biases of-
you guessed it - the 

administration. " 

committee may well be in order. 
However, the opportunity for 
students to both voice and hear 

opinions that are free and inde-
pendent (even when others find 
them offensive) is fundamental to 
the university experience. We 
must therefore be very cautious 
in this endeavor. Any such com-
mittee should be composed prin-
cipally of students, with the goal 
of promoting, not "clarifying," 
the independent voices of the 
university. 

In the long run, the universi-
ty should protect free and open 
media (even if it, unfortunately, 
sometimes displays pornogra-
phy) rather than denying stu-
dents the cbance to make their 
own decisions about what is, and 
what is not, appropriate to 
watch.

looking mobster,!robably about 
25, actually wave . I waved back. 
I wondered at the time if they 
would have reacted differently if 
we had started snapping pho-
tographs. Thinking back, I bet 
they would have smiled and 
thrown up the peace sign. Meer 
all, the police already knew who 
and where they were; the nearest 
station was less than 300 feet 
away. 

Before the parliament passed 
an anti-Yalruza law a few years 
ago, their presence was even more 

~. t. A black wooden panel . over the door was all that was Ie or the flashy sign with 
gold lettering that used to 
announce the name of that partic-
ulu Yakuza branch. 

The nearby police station was 
YICIIlt when we walked past. Our 
profeaor wspected that the offi-

cen might have been in the 
upstairs quarters, asleep. 

I'd give the address of the 
Yakuza building so that other visi-
tors can someday have the plea-
sure of waving at a mobster, 
except that the street did not have 
a name. Most streets in Japan do 
not have names, making navigat-
ing a bit stressful. 

Out of the 2,OOO-plus streets 
in Tokyo, only 100 have names. 
Some parts of Tokyo are even 
more confusing: There are 
nameless streets full of nameless 
restaurants, all with the same 
menu an·d prices. Post office 
employees who have to deal with 
this system are either psychic, 
really lucky, or know the area like 
the back of their collective 
hands. 

When typhoons trap us inside, 
UC and Japanese students alike 
turn to the one thing whose unify-

ing presence can calm even the 
strongest storm: Nintendo. 

A few weeks ago I bought 
"Super Mario Bros. 3" and a 
Nintendo Famicom, colloquially 
known as "regular Nin~endo" in 
America. This was later supple-
mented by someone else's Super 
Famicom (~Super Nintendo"), 
which preceded a video-game 
shopping spree that ended with a 
library of games from "Super 
Mario Kan" to "Megaman X2." 
Rainy weather keeps the 
Famicoms running. 

As long as there is a Nintendo 
controller and a can of beer with-
in ann's reach, these imported 
California students can tolerate 
any storm.

~ I LETTERS TO THE EDITORS 
CALPIRG needs 

pledges to fight cause 
The California Srudent Public 

Interest Research Group is the 
largest social service organization 
on the UCSD campus. We work 
on campus and statewide to pro-
tect the environment, fight 
against hunger and homelessness, 
get students out to vote and 
reduce the price of textbooks. 
Just last year we were able to help 
pass the strongest clean-water 
law in the country, raise 520,000 
for the homeless and help pass a 
bill in the California Legislature 
to reduce the price of textbooks. 

Students founded CALPIRG 
in the 1970s because they wanted 
to make a difference on important 
issues. Because of their energy, 
idealism and access to university 
resources, students have always 
been at the forefront of social 
change in our society, spearhead-
ing the civil rights, anti-war and 
environmental movements. 
However, students also lack 
things like money, expertise and 
continuity that make it difficult 
for them to spearhead the more 
complicated and sustained work it 
takes to pass a bill through the 
legislature or sue a water polluter 
in court. 

CALPIRG is successful because 
students pool their resources on 
campus and statewide so that we 
can hire experts to work with us -
so that we can make a difference on 
campus, as well as at the state and 
national level. 

We're able to do all of this 
because over 30,000 UC stu-
dents, including 20 percent of 
UCSD students, have pledged to 
fund CALPIRG through a 55-

per-quarter optional student 
activities fee. 

This week, a bunch of com-
mitted student activist volunteers 
will be asking UCSD students to 
pledge to support CALPJRG's 
efforts. In order for anyone Stu-
dent to be billed the CALPIRG 
fee on campus, 20 percent of stu-
dents on the same campus must 
also agree to pay the CALPIRG 
fee. This is designed to ensure 
that when a student is consider-
ing pledging, they have a guaran-
tee that their money will actually 
be pooled with the money of 
enough others to really make a 
difference. 

I hope that you are able to 
pledge this quarter and help us in 
our efforts to stand up for students 
and our rights.

Destination: Austria 
By ELLEN MCDOUGALL 

Contributing Writer 
The mountainous regions of 

Europe offer orne of the most 
exciting ski resorts in the world. 
Among them is Switzerland, with 
its famous and picturesque loca-
tions, but a destination that is far 
more expensive than the rest of 
Europe, making its charm for stu-
dents questionable. 

In Austria, skiing is an activity 
for locals and a part of the culture, 
rather than simply a vacation 
activity uncharacteristic of the 
rest of the country. 

In general, skiing in Europe is 
quite different from what one may 
be used to in America. Customer 
service, organized Lift lines and 
courteous skiing are not necessar-
ily priorities. Instead, it's more of 
a free-far-all, and whoever has the 

~ d Shelley Malsutani 
Quaint beauty: Halstadt is one of the many beautiful hamlets that dot the 
Austrian countryside around the Kitzbuhel area. 

sharpest elbows and most raw 
determination gets the most ski-
ing done. 

Off-piste skiing is a lot more 
accessible and less risky, and runs 
are generally more varied in terms 
of difficulty level and conditions. 

Kitzbuhel is probably the most 
famous resort in Austria, with 
prices to match; however, staying 
in nearby Kirchberg gives a better 
insight into "real" Austrian cul-
ture and has more reasonable 
prices without missing out on the 
action. There are tons of small 
pubs that feel more like the land-
lords' own living room, which is 
great for cozy, relaxing nights. 

The hotel will probably be able 
to rent or lend out "bum boards," 
glorified plastic trays to sit on and 
fly down the lower slopes. Try this 
in the dark for the full impact. 
Similar but more white-knuck-
ling, and not to be missed, is 
tobogganing in Oberau, a short 
bus ride from Kitzbuhel. 

The skiing is excellent, and 
there are a huge number of long 
runs. Don't leave without skiing 
the Hahnenkamm. It is best to 
head for it early, as it's a major 
attraction at the resort and gets 
very busy and icy, bur it is amaz-

ing to go with an instructor who 
can explain the tactical way of 
ski ing this insanely hardcore 
slope. 

The first and perhaps most 
impressive part is the Maustrap, the 
first jump, resembling a massive 
cliff edge. 
Jumping 
even a tiny 
bit too late 
flies the 
skiers way off 
into the dis-
tant forest, 
seemingly 
never to be 
seen again. 
Absolute madness. 

After Hahnenkamm, it's defi-
nitely a good idea to get onto the 
less popular slopes where the lifts 
are slower but there are fewer 
lines and more open slopes. There 
is so much variety that it's quite a 
challenge to see all the areas avail-
able. 

Try the ski safari, a 22-mile 
day-trip of runs and lifts, the 
hardest of which are red 
(bluelblack). It's worth the time 
and effort for the stunning vistas 
of Italy above the tree line and 
what feels like a real adventure.

In Austria, you can drink beer if 
you are over 16 and any pther 
alcohol over 18 (hurrah!). 
Nightlife is top notch, and 
Kitzbuhel is stunning at night, 
involving many fairy lights, pretty 
trees and small, winding streets. 

The Londoner 
is a lively spot for 
pub-style drinking, 
and there are 
numerous bars and 
clubs. 

Particularly 
memorable was the 
Glockenspiel for its 
real European 
trance and techno 

music and charmingly tacky light-
ing.

Accommodations: In Kitzbuhel, 
expect to pay more than in sur-
rounding areas. For those who 
want to stay in town but are on a 
budget, check out Kaiser Hotel, 
Bahnhofstrasse 2. the Villa 
Hummer or the Hotel Karlburger.

MONDAY, ClCTOBER 25, 2004 'TliE UCSD GUARDIAN 

18+: Hot Monkey Love offers wide variety 
continued /rom page B 

HotMonkey~ 
Last is a small coffee shop/club 

that can be found near San Diego 
State called Hot Monkey Love. 
The name stands out, which is what 
usually draws students to it in the 
first place. 

Coffee shop by day, happening 
club spot by night, Hot Monkey 
Love has something different every 
night: live bands, poetry readings, 
open mic night, goth night and 
salsa night, among others. 

"I thought salsa night levery 
Sunday beginning at S p.m.] sound-
ed interesting and was glad to hear 
that there was something different 
going on at one of the IS-plus 
venues besides hip-hop night and 
'SOS night," said Jayson Martin, a 
John Muir College freshman. The 

$6 cover includes an hour of salsa 
instructions on basic steps and 

" ... [ll was glad to hear 
that there was something 
different going on at one 
of the lB .. pittS venues 

besides hip .. hop night and 
'80s night." 

-~ Martin, John Muir 
CoIIep freshman 

rythms, and then it breaks into JUSt 
dancing. Hot Monkey love is sig-
nificantly smaller than other clubs, 

which gives it a more intimate feel-
ing, and the people are usually 
understanding of those with two 
left feet. The cheaper cover charge 
is definitely a relief. 

Bottom line: For those of us 
looking for something new and 
interesting, or just a fun place to 
hang out and socialize with people, 
Hot Monkey Love is a distinct hit. 
Information on Hot Monlcey Love 
and its many events can be found at 
h rtp://W'UTIJI. hormanluyklvtcaft. com. 

For students who are more into 
the larger, crowded clubs with 
flashing lights and louder dance 
music, sadly it seems the best solu-
tion is still to wait for that 21st 
birthday or finding a good fake ID. 
And then there's always Mexico. 

Additional under-21 activities 
can be found at http://www.stmditgo-
clubs. cum/under 21 .asp. 

Austria: Skiing available for less than $ 70 a day 
continued from page B 

ing brealcfast, in the high season. 
Otherwise, head for Kirchberg, 
where the cheaper places range 
from $25 to $50 per person per 
night. 

Other exciting activities: The 
Austrian National Forest, Aurach 
Natural Reserve is where you can 
get up close and personal with 
deer and other animals; Aquarena 
for swimming, hot pools and an 
ice bath (not for the faint-he art-

ed!); and Munich, Germany as a 
possible day-trip. 

Transport: The nearest airports 
are in Munich, Germany, and 
Salzburg, Austria. There are bus 
connections to other Austrian 
resorts, including Kirchberg, 
Aurach, Jochberg and Pass 
Thurn. 

Food: Don't leave without trying 
schnitzel with noodles. It's a great 
alternative to· high priced restau-

rant food . Cheap eats in restau-
rant-sryle dining start around $20 
for dinner, but hotels often offer 
food, as well . 

Drinking: It's all about gluwein 
' " and that doesn't translate as 
glue-wine! You can order this bev-
erage at any bar or local restau-
rant. 

Lift passes: For seven days in 
high season, it's around $200; low 
season, it's $165 . .

Men's tennis takes seventh at ITA 
Small" College Championships 

Swatt, Molden drop first two matches 
before winn.ing third at national event 

By CYNIHIA BLADE CHAVEZ 
Associate Sports Editor 

After winning the NCAA 
Division n IntercoUegiate Tennis 
Association West Regionals dou-
bles finals on Oct. 2, UCSD senior 
Bryan . Swatt and junior Brent 
Molden placed seventh overall at 
the ITA Small College 
Championships in Fort Myers, 
Fla., on Oct. 16. The tournament, 
presented by the United Stares 
Tennis Association, draws the best 
men's and women's singles and 
doubles teams in NCAA Division 
Il, Division III, the National 
Association of Intercollegiate 
Athletics and community colleges 
from all regions. It fearured the 
best teams from each of the eight 
regions in the nation. 

Dante Cipulli of Division n 
Southwest Baptist was crowned the 
men's singles champion in two sets, 
6-1,6-3, over Steven Lockwood of 
Fresno City Junior College. 
Meanwhile, Larikah Russell of 
NAIA Southern Nazarene took the 
women's singles title against 
Lindsay Hageiman of Division ill 
Washington and Lee University, 6-
3, 6-2. In doubles, Ivan Angulo 
Carrasco and Ricardo Omana from 
NAIA College of Santa Fe took the 
doubles title over Division n 
Armstrong Atlantic State's Robert 
Jendelund and Dale White 7-6 (8), 
6-4, while Liz Bondi and Elizabeth 
Steel of Division III DePauw 
edged Southern Nazarene!; Russell 
and Daria Ivanova in womens dou-
bles, 7-6, 4-6, 11-9.

three sets to Kshitij Dwivedi and 
Paul Ratchford of Division ill 
Presbyterian College, 7 -6, 6-7, 
10-6. Their loss placed UCSD in 
the consolation bracket, which 
determined fifth through eighth 
place. Swan and Molden faced off 
against St. Edward's Mario 
Quintero and Kendall Slnashey; 
however, despite being broken 
only twice, the Tritons duo was 
defeared, 6-4, 6-4. 

However, Swan and Molden 
improved their play and secured 
seventh place with a straight-sets 
victory over Brian Bogus and Kyle 
Dougherty of Division II 
Bloomsburg University, 6-4, 6-3. 

"I was pleased with their over-
all effort, there is no doubt about 
that," UCSD head coach Eric 
Steidl mayer said. "I think we 
were all disappointed that we 
were not able to play bener at the 
tournament and have more of a 
national impact." 

Although Swan and Molden 
lost a close one in the first round, 
they realized there was not much 
separating the top teams in the 
nation from UCSD. 

"I think there was one team in 
Division n a bit bener than the 
rest, and all the other teams were 
a bout the same level of play," 
Steidlmayer said. 

The Regionals and the Small 
College Championships are 
Swatt and Molden's doubles 
debut at UCSD. Despite going 1-
3, Steidlmayer knows the pair 
plays well together and is confi-
dent the two of them will bounce 
back and play solidly in the 
upcoming season.

Men~5 soccer 
drops close 

decision 
., IAEL ENlEEN 

St.rt Writer 

The UCSD mens soccer team is 
trying to work the kinks out of its 
overtime play. The Tritons once 
again found themselves playing 
more than twO periods on Oct. 23 
against No. 11 Cal State 
Dominguez Hills in Carson, Calif., 
foUowing a scoreless regulation. 
With the game on the line, the 
Tritons could not find a hero in this 
match and lost 1-0 in the 92nd 
minute to the Toros. 

With this most recent defeat, 
the Tritons fall to 7-3-3 overall and 
6-3-2 in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association. The Toros 
remain undefeated in the CCM 
and are the team to beat going into 
the playoffs, which are scheduled 
for Nov. 5 through Nov. 7. 

The Tritons could be staying 
home come November, thanIcs to 
Francisco Corona's penalty shot 
that was awarded following a con-
troversial Triton penalty charged to 
Kei Kamara. Corona's goal came on 
his eighth shot of the game, prov-
ing that UCSD's normally stingy 
defense could not hold back the 
powerful Toros. Cal State 
Dominguez Hills outs hot the 
Tritons 19-6, including 3-0 in over-
time. Senior goalkeeper Edward 
Ruhland kept the game in reach 
with five saves, but the Toro offense 
bombarded the Tritons shot afrer 
shot. According to senior defense-
man Luke Russell, however, the 
shot count is misleading. 

"The numbers look intimidat-
ing," Russell said. "But, we forced

MONDAY, OCTOBER ZS, ZOO4 

Men's -soccer: Overtime 
woes prove costly for UCSD 

cOl'lCinutd from pact 14 
them to take long shots, and they 
only put six shots on &ame. We 
played very good defense." 

Cal State Dominguez Hills' 
goalkeeper Kyle Polak played all 92 
minutes, 36 seconds of the game 
and recorded a shutout with one 
save. UCSD's offense was shut 
down by a Toro defense that 
stopped almost all of UCSD's scor-
ing chances. Corona had more 
shots than the entire Triton team 
and the Toros more than tripled 
UCSD's shot count. Junior mid-
fielder and Triton point leader 
Matthew Davey was held to only 
one shot in the game. 

Russell, despite the loss, thinks 
that the Tritons looked good 
against Cal State Dominguez Hills 
and is not fazed by the loss. 

"We played very well and we 
know it," he said. "And [the Torosl 
know it too." 

Anna~ 
......... : Junior Jon Krupansky 
and the Tritons face OIIertime trouble. 

Ar 

Overtime has been friend and 
foe to the Tritons this year, espe-
cially against Cal State Dominguez 
Hills. On Sept. 22 at RlMAC Field, 
the two teams found themselves in a 
scoreless tie at the end of regula-
tion' and at the end of two overtime 
periods, it remained scoreless. This 
season, the Tritons are 1-2-3 in 
overtime with three games remain-
ing in the regular season, including 
a rnalceup of the Oct. 20 game 
against Cal Poly Potnona that was 
rained out. The Tritons also play 
both Cal State San Bernardino and 
Cal State Bakersfield in October. 
All three of the upcoming games 
are at RIMAC Field, where the 
Tritons are 4-0-3. 

"Hopefully, we won't even have 
to play in OT in the next three 
games," RusseU said. "However, if 
we do, I know we can win. We just 
need to relax and be more com-
posed in overtime." 

As for the playoff situation, the 
Tritons are wallcing on shaky 
ground. Cal Poly Pomona and Cal 
State San Bernardino are both 
lower-ranked teams that the Tritons 
defeated earlier in the season, 
including a 6-1 annihilation of the 
Broncos, in which Davey scored 
three goals. The game against Cal 
State Bakersfield, however, will test 

. the Tritons. The Roadrunners are 
11-3-2 overaU and 7-1-2 in CCAA 
games, but the Tritons managed a 
1-0 win when they faced them on 
Sept. 19 in Bakersfield, Calif. 

According to Russell, the 
Tritons will need to play aggressive-

. Iy and with confidence to make it to 
the CCAA championship game. 

"We're definitely still in it, but 
we have to win the next three 
games," Russell said. "We stiU have 
a chance."

THE UCSD GUARDIAN SPORTS 15 

, Soccer: Four regular season games remain 
continud from (JO(e r 6 

came up with four big saves to 
keep UCSD in the game, includ-
ing a blocked shot by Toro junior 
defender Jessica Gatica, who got a 
shot off amidst a scramble in the 
box. Meanwhile, UCSD head 
coach Brian McManus jumbled 
his lineup on the field to try to 
find the right combination, yield-
ing in a couple of scoring oppor-
tunities. With less than 10 seconds 
remaining, two Toros collided 
about I S yards in front of their 
goal and Sepulveda capitalized, 
taking the loose baU and dribbling 
toward the net. With a Toro 
defender pressuring from the 
back, Sepulveda got a shot off that 
would have scored, except it nar-
rowly missed the net and went 
wide to the left instead. 

After a halftime pep talk by 
McManus, the Tritons turned 
things around and played aggres-
sively from the first whistle of the 
second half. 

"We got ripped on at halftime, 
so we were able to pull our "heads 

~ut and play a little bit better," 
Sepulveda said. 

UCSD had some very close 
chances, but Cal Sute Dominguez 
HiUs' junior goalie Mallory 
Dominguez also came up with big 
saves to maintain her shutout. The 
Toros fouled the Tritons II times, 
giving them some room to control 
play. Most of the free Icicles for 
UCSD came from the right side 
facing the net. Senior midfielder 
J aclyn Shaffer tried several times to 
direct her left-foot shot toward the 
rear post, hoping the Tritons 
would find the back door, but the 
Toro defense remained stable and 
kept UCSD scoreless. In the end, 
Hearn's goal proved to be enough 
to defeat UCSD. 

Besides the slow suet, inexperi-
ence was also a key factor in the 
match, according to McManus. 

"We have a bunch of young, 
fiest-year players who still think it's 
just like club [soccer], and they're 
having a bit of fun," he said. "And 
it's not; [the Taros were 1 celebrat-
ing after the game like they just 

won a championship. Everyone 
wants to beat UCSD women's soc-
cer, And in the second half, I 
thought [UCSD] did great. You've 
got to come in and play at the 
beginning of the game, not JUSt one 
half." 

AI though the Tri [Ons lost, thJy 
can still remain in first place pro-
vided they win their final three 
matches, according to McMan\ls. 

"We'll see if they can pick it up 
and come back," he said. 

Sepulveda is confident the 
Tritons will bounce back from 
their loss and play bener in the 
critical three games. 

"The coaches have to keep 
reminding us how important each 
game is because we have so many 
new people," she said. "We need to 
come out playinf; like we did in the 
second half and we need to come 
out a lot stronger." 

UCSD is back in action against 
Cal Poly Pomona on Oct. 25 at 
RlMAC Arena to make up the Oct. 
20 match that was postponed due 
of rain.

Top ... ranked Tritons suffer 
second defeat of 2004 

No.2 Cal State Dominguez Hills 
upsets Tritons in 1-0 victory 

By CYNTHIA BLADE CHAVEZ 
Associate Sports Editor 

One might deduct that Cal 
State Dominguez Hills' quest for 
revenge and the top-ranked 
Tritons' sluggish stan got the bet-
ter of the UCSD women's soccer 
team (12-2-1), which posted its 
second loss of the season in a 1-0 
shJtout on Oct. 23 at Toro Soccer 
Stadium in Carson, Calif. The 
Toros (11 -4-2), who were ranked 
second overall in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
behind the Tritons, lost at UCSD 
in September, 1-0. 

"I think [we] were really 13c-
sadaisical because of the rain, and we 
had too many indoor practices," 
sophomore forward Kathy 
Sepulveda said. "So I don't think we 
were quite in the right mindset to 
play hard in the beginning of the 
game, because we staned really 
slow." 

The Tritons' inability to keep up 
with the Toros in the opening half 

ended up costing them the game 
when Cal State Dominguez Hills 
scored in the 17th minute. 
Sophomore midfielder Candace 
Hearn sent the ball in the upper 
right of the net off of a pass from 
junior forward Rachele McDonald 
to put the Toros ahead, 1-0. 

"We knew this was a huge game 
and that we needed to come out and 
play our best," Hearn said. "We 
needed to beat them to be number 
one and take control of the stand-
ings." 

Before the game, Cal State 
Dominguez Hills trailed UCSD by 
three points in the CCAA standings, 
and its win ties both squads for first-
place. Both teams are now 7-0-1 in 
theCCAA 

UCSD found itself scrambling 
to play defense in the first half, with 
Cal State Dominguez Hills apply-
ing pressure on the Triton back-
field, keeping senior goalie Jamie 
Lautenschleger on her toes. She

Cross country teams rally to 
place at CCAA Championships 
Hodgins, Eap continue to lead 
respective teams to Nationals 

By NATAUE 10RION 
Contributing Writer 

The Tritons women's and men's 
cross country teams are coming 
into the home stretch of the 2004 
season strong, taking second and 
third, respectively, at the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association Championships hosted 
by Cal Poly Pomona on Oct. 23 . 

The women's side earned a sec-
ond-place finish out of 10 teams on 
the 3.7 -mile course. Junior Mimi 
Hodgins placed first for the 
Tritons at 20 minutes, 38.7 sec-
onds, giving her a sixth-place finish

Junior Michelle DiMeo took ninth 
and 10th places at 20:54.50 and 
20:55, respectively. Chico State 
earned first place with the top-five 
finishers, giving its team a perfect 
score of 15. 

Five UCSD women earned AlI-
CCM honors for their scores. As 
the first freshman finisher, Dunn 
received CCAA Freshman of the 
Year honors. Also, freshmanJessica 

Laslovich and junior Lindsey 
Young came in at 13th and 15th 
place, respectively, for which they 
each earned All-CCAA honors. 

The men had a great 4.5-mile 
run, coming in third right behind 
Chico State and Cal Poly Pomona. 
Daniel Rojas of Cal Poly Pomona 
finished first. The Triton leader, 
senior Robert Eap, finished 11 th 
with 3 time of 22 :59.90, followed 
by junior Carl Lostrom with 
23:19.90, both gaining two AJI-
CCAA honors.

Women's water ski wins Nationals 
Men's side takes seventh despite individuals sucesses 

By CHARLES NGUYEN 
Staff Writer 

For the UCSD women's water 
ski team, winning is a breeze. 

The women's team won first 
place in its first Division II 
National Collegiate Water Ski 
Association Championship in a 
record landslide. Kansas, the sec-
ond-place team, managed 2,855 
points, 590 points shon of the 
Tritons' 3,445 final score, a record 
NCWSA margin. 

Sophomore team captains 
Lindsay Baxter and Stephannie 
Spann led their team over eight 
others at the three-day competi-
tion to seven All-American per-
formances. While none of the 
women won gold medals in any 
event, their combined effons and 
points helped them win in team 
categories of slalom, trick, jump 

and overall. 
Spann scored the highest of five 

Tritons in the jump category, with 
305 total points, which warranted 
her a tie for fourth place. 
Sophomores Baxter, Mindy 
Bendheim and Christy Getzlaff and 
freshman Ashleigh Grant also 
placed in the category, propelling 
UCSD to a first-place total ofl,055 
points in the team jump category. 

The Tritons won the slalom 
team event behind Brittany 
Cornelius' fourth-place finish. 
Her 320-point effon combined 
with Getzlaff, Bendheim, senior 
Tracie Spies' points and a person-
al best for Spann to sweep UCSD 
past the Jayhawks. Cornelius and 
Getzlaff earned a pair of Division 
II All-American titles for their 
performances. 

The final event of the champi-
onship saw the Tritons women wio-

niog the most medals of any of 
their previous categories. Four 
UCSD women won medals out of 
five possible in the event, including 
Spann's silver-medal perfonnance. 
She was joined by teammates 
Getzlaff, Baxter and sophomore 
Laura Barich, who came in fourth 
place and a tie for fifth place, 
respectively. 

Kansas' Amy Bing won a silver 
medal overall, leading theJayhawks 
to their second-place finish. Spann 
finished in fourth place overall as 
the highest placing Triton. 

The Triton men, however, did 
not have as much luck as the 
women, finishing in seventh place 
in the field. UCSD placed highest 
in the men's tride: category, finish-
ing in fifth place. However, their 
efforts were not enough to win in

Women's volleyball shuts out weekend 
Wtlson and Canape provide important wall of defense 
By CYNIHIA BLADE CHAVEZ 

Associate Sports Editor 

None of the teams in the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association can find any holes in 
the nearly flawless play of the No. 
2 UCSD women's volleyball team, 
which posted back-ta-back 3-0 
sweeps of Chico State and Cal 
State Stanislaus on Oct. 22 and 
Oct. 23, respectively, at RIMAC 
Arena. 

Even Chico State head coach 
Cody Hein knew his team was in 
for a tough challenge against the 
Tritons. 

"We knew very well we were 
coming up against the No.2 team 
in the country," Hein said. "And we 
don't match up well with them 
[Physically] because they can hit 
over us. When you're playing a 
team which is that superior to you 
in talent, [and] they give you those 
easy points, you have to take them. 
We didn't win those points." 

The Tritons (23-1, 13-OCCM) 
came,prepared to beat Chico State, 
and adjusted to everything their 
opponents threw at them, evident 
in some big blocks in game three to 
seal the win. 

With game one tied, 8-8, senior 
outside hitter Stacy Dunsmore 
caught the Wildcats off guard 
when she just tlide:ed the ball over 
the net, giving UCSD the lead 
before they ran away with game 
one, 30-19. 

In game two, Chico 
State made some 
cbanges and began 
setting differently to 
keep the match within 
three points late in the game. At 23-
20, Hein called a timeout to rally 
his team, but it ended up working 
to the Thtons' advantage. UCSD 
clung tightly to its lead and out-
worked Chico State to win the long 
rallies. Its defense paid off, especial-
ly senior outside hitter Bonnie 
WIlson, who kept diving after the 
ball, almost running into the scor-
er's table on a few occasions to keep 
the point alive. She also clioched 
game two for the Tritons with a kill 
to down the Wildcats, 30-24. 

With Chico State making nec-
essary changes to keep game two 
close, the Wildcats thought they 
could finally crack UCSD in game 
three. They ran into a waD, howev-
er, namely Wilson and !eDior mid-
dle blocker Kaldra Canape, who 

came up with solid defense to send 
the Tritons into a 9-0 run. Canape 
and Wtlson's blocks continued to 

be a key factor in 
game three, ignit-
ing UCSD espe-
cially after their 
blocks won the 

longer rallies. 
"I felt great I felt 

lilre we had a really good, solid 
blocking match," Canape said. 
"Our energy is a lot higher when 
we're able to put the other team 
down. Our defense is solid anyway, 
so when we're able to add more 
blocks, it's good." 

Canape and Wtlson's blocks, 
Chico State's 14 errors and 
UCSD's .316 attack percentage 
were too much for the Wildcats to 
handle, and they lost game three, 
30-17. Wbimey Johnson and 
Meghan McKinney tallied 10 and 
eight kills, respectively, in the los-
ing effort. 

"It was fun," Wtlson said. "We 
had a lot of energy, especially in the 
third game. I felt lilre we let them 
in a little too much in the first two 
games, especially in the sec-
ond game. We put a lot of 
energy in the third game 
and we had some 
good plays 
[and] some 

blocks 
t hat 
re a II y 
helped 
us." 

Wil-
son led 
UCSD 
with 15 kills 
and 14 digs, 
plus Canape 
added 10 kills. 
Senior 
Teresa Ohta 
guided the offense 
with 32 kills and an 
ace while adding nine 
digs. Defensively, 
freshman libero 
Natalie Facchini led 
with 15 digs while 
Dunsmore recorded 
10 dip of her own. 

EftD Hein bad 

to admit the Wtldcats could not 
keep up. 

"A big credit to [bead coach] 
Duncan [McFarland]. I think he's 
got his team playing a lot better," 
he said. "When they came up to 
play us, they weren't blocking that 
well, and tonight, they clearly have 
been working on blocking. He's 
just such a &bulous coach. They 
run a quide: offense and their ball 
control is veiy good." 

The Tritons continued their 
momentum through to the nen 
match against Cal State Stanislaus, 
sweeping the Warrion 30-12, 30-
13, 30-26. Dunsmore took charge 
at this match with 11 kills and six 
digs. Facchini had 13 digs to record 
back-to-bade: match highs while 
Wilson and senior middle blocker 
Katie Hogan each tallied nine kills. 
Ohta distributed 25 assists before 
resting in game three and freshman 
setter Kimberly Adams stepped in 
and added 14 assists •• 

Once again. the Tritons played 
well overall and took games one 
and two decisively. The Warriors 

rallied back in game 
three to trail UCSD, 
28-26. After a Triton 

timeout, UCSD 
closed the. match 
with a Dunsmore 
kill. The Tritons 
now look ahead 
to a big match 

against No.7 Cal 
State San Bernardino on Oct. 

27 at 7 p.m. at RIMAC Arena. 
With the regular season winding 
down, UCSD is ready to &ce 
tougher opponents to prepare for 
the playoffs. 

"I thiolc there's no question 
that the team is looking at the 
match against San Bernardino 
because they are such a strong 
team," McFarland said. "We do a 
good job playing well against a 
team that's not pushing us that 
hard. I can tell everyone is getting 

antsy for a big challenge 
now, and we know that 

playoffs are 
coming 
up."
