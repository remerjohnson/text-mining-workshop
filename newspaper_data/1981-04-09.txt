Awoman 
and a'rape 
Assaulted by a co-
worker, and friend 

BY LISA SULLIVAN 
AND WILLIAM HAMILTON 

Staff Writer 
After two week of dating a fellow 

student who seemed like a nice guy, a 
young woman at UCSD was raped by him. 

And like so many oth~r women 
victimized, this woman is having a hard 
time convincing the police that her "date" 
forcibly raped her. 

Immediat~l~ following the attack, the 
woman repoNed-it to the San Diego Police 
department, and went to the hospital for a 
physical examination wich confirmed that 
she had been brui ed during the incident. 

But despite this evidence the police failed 
to investi2ate her complaint because thev 
were dou btful that the acquaintance could 
be proven a rapIst, she saId. 

"The su pect wasn't even questioned by 
police," she said. "I'm amazed that this 
person is still walking around campus, free 
to do this again." 

"The police department is supposed to 
encourage these reports," she said, "but 
they were anything but encouraging. What 
I encountered down there (SDPD) would 
give anybody the willies. " 

She is certain that this man forced 
himself upon her and that he has probably 
done this sort of thing before. "It was too 
well planned," she said. 

They were at his re idence and had been 
kissing when the man began to forcibly 
rape her. She explicitly told him to refrain, 
but he pinned her down. Finally, when the 
rape had been consummated, she went to 
find her keys, but he had hidden them. 

After being thrown out the door, along 
with her keys, the woman drove home and 
immediately reported the crime to police. 

What this woman went through is not 
unusual, according to director of the Rape 
Prevention education program Joan 
Koerper. 

"Acquaintance rape i the most pressing 
problem on this campus," she said, "I 
believe most sincerely that at least one 
rape goes on a week on this campus and at 
least one assault occurs every day between 
acquaintances. " 

But what is unusual is that this woman 
reported the crime. "Rape is the most 
under-reported crime in the country, and 
that's even more the case when the woman 
knows her rapist," said Miriam Levens 
who works with Counseling and 
Psychological Services. 

"Most women are reluctant to report 
uch crimes because of the way in which 

society conditions them lu ft!t!ll:Ulpable; to 
be somewhow respon ible for the rape," 
she said. 

"Indeed, women are often as umed to 
have tacitly provoked a rape. They are told

The second story is about another kind of 
sexual assault - The increasing incidence of 
child mole tation near campus. 

Molestation a 
problem in 
UCSD area 

BY LISA SULLIVAN 
AND WILLIAM HAMILTON 

StaHWriten 
While efforts to publicize the 

severity of the rape ituation on the 
UCSD campus have alerted the 
academic community to on-campus 
assaults, the ituation, as it applies to 
UCSD, does not merely affect the 
campus area proper. 

The San Diego police are concerned 
about the ri e in the incidence of child 
molestation in areas adjacent to the 
un i v e r sit y , s pe c if i ca 11 y the 
victimization of ele1nentary school 
children who walk to school. 

Many of these children are the sons 
and daughters of UCSD parents who 
live in the proximity of the campus. 

Aocording to Officer Mike Duffy of 
the SDPD, child molestation at an 
alarming rate, esptitially in the open 
field area near Doyle Elementary 
across La Jolla Village Dr. from the 
Mesa Apartments, which Duffy 
admits is 'unpatrollabJe.' 

"We've had an increase in the 
incidence of indecent exposures in that 
area," he says, "incJudingcases where 
suspects will follow children walking 
to school. " . 

Duffy, who is also studying towards 
the PhD degree in clinical psychology, 
is the department's School Sattey 
Representative for schools in the area. 
He notes that while in the spring and 
fan there is traditionally an increase in 
child molestation, the figures thus far 
available to him indicate that the 
statistics are "disproportionate for 
this time of year." 

"We have had numerous incidences 
of indecent exP<l'!ure, inc1udingjoggers 
who purposely wear loose-fitting 
clothing," he says .. 

In addition to that type of 
molestation, there have been reported 
incidents in which motorists have 
called children over to their vehicles, 
opened their doors and exposed 
them elves, "sometimes mastuba-
t' ." ~t's bad enough that children are 
allowed to walk to school via the 
crossing of a thru-way with a 55 mph 
speed limit, let alone that they should 

. venture through an area infested with 
snakes and child ' molesters a a 
convenient short-cut to school," he 
sa)'s. 

Toward appraising par-ents of the 
dangers of allowing their children to 
walk to school unescorted, Duffy and 
the SDPD have sent informative 
brochures to parent and approached 
the local PTA. At one such meeting of 
the PTA from four area schools, over 
175 concerned parents and teachers

Also says test scores for 
entering freshmen declining 

A reader on UC 's efforts to a ist "underprepared" students 
suggests that tuition may be instituted to help pay for 
programs which are used to help these students. 

The report, released Tue day, also takes note of a decline in 
UC admission standards and student test scores. . 

"If current trends continue-and the decline in preparation 
shows no signs of abating, at least in the short run-the 

~niversity is faced with a choice between continuing to drain 
lts own resources for this purpose or asking students to pay 
even more for each others' ba ic kills training unless the 
state provides relief," the report conclude. ' 

"Unquestionably," the report ays, "the university's efforts 
to as 1st . unde,rprepared st~den~s co t money. By our 
con ervatlve estImate, the uOlverslty invested $5.3 million in 
ba ic skills activities in 1979-80. 

"(The programs) have been a ked to alleviate racial and 
~thn!c segregation, to assimilate and acculturate thousands of 
ImmIgrants, refugees and native born U.S. citizens who have 
limited proficiency in Engli h, to addre the needs of special 
categorie of tudents like the handicapped, and to attend to 
the legitimate and difficult 
need of tho e at the bottom 
of the achievement scale .. ." 

The report , which ha been 
di tributed within the 
university "for discussion," 
notes that for students, the 
decline in preparation 
"means a more difficult 
tran ition to college, a limited 
choice of major , a longer 
time to degree, and a weater 
probability of dropping out." 

For faculty, the decline 
"means frustration in the 
classroom, a sense of 
helplessness , and real 
confu ion about changing 
roles because many (faculty 
members) have not bveen 
trained to teach basic 
compo ition and math 
kills. " 
Not one UC campus in 1968 

had as many a half its 
entering fre hmen score 
below 550 on the verbal 
portion of the Scholastic 
Aptitude Test (SAT). In 1979, 
however, more than half of 
the entering freshmen on 
each general campu scored 
below 550. 

There is also a decline in 
cores on the mathematic 

portion of the SAT, but it i 
not as dramatic. In 1968,31.3 
percent of entering freshmen 
scored below 550; in 1979, the 
percentage had ri en to 41.9 

The decline has hit UCSD 
about as hard as any of the 
campuses. 

The average SAT verbal 
score here is now 510 
(behind Berkeley's 524 and 
Santa Cruz' 522, a decline of 
32 points since 1972), and the 
average math score is 568, 
behind Berkeley's 599, a 
decline of 14 points ince 
1972, one of the smalle ·t in 
the ystem. 

Both UC systemwide and 
UCSD total remain well 
above the average for 
entering fres hmen (427 
verbal and 467 math) ; 
however, the mean core for

Letter's anti-semitic views injures Jews 
Editor: 

A letter that appeared in 
your n~spaper under the 
headline ni is Anti·Semitic 
(Guardian, April 6) was 
extremely injurious to 
Palestinians and Jews, 
however accurate or 
inaccurate its accusations 
against the ni might have 
been. 

For one thing, the article 
consistently used the words 
anti-semitism where anti-
Jew was clearly intended. 
This may seem a trivial 
exercise in semantics to 
.'\mericans but to a 
Palestinian, an Arab or a 
Semite (but certainly not a 
Jew), it is extremely 
insulting. 

At the same time, the 
article stated as facts about 
Judaism things which are 
hotly debated interpreta' 
tions.' It said that Judaism 
consists of three things: God, 
the Law and nationalism. 
Many Jews disagree violen tJy 
with this interpretation and 
would drop the third 
quantity, nationalism, from 
the list. The objections come 
from a wide variety of 
sources. Some are strictly 
religious, coming directly 
from interpretation of the 
Torah. Some are political and 
are made by Jews who view 
nationalism as counterpro-
ductive to Jewish welfare in 
the long·run. 

Since nationalism for Jews 
is Zionism and the Jews who 
oppose it are therefore anti-
Zionist, the equation of 
Judaism with Zionism is a 
terribly offensive thing to 
them. To call Jewish anti-
Zionists (some of whom are 
extremely devout and all of 
whom are just as concerned 
with the health and well-
being of Jews) anti·Semitic is 
slanderous. 

It must be pointed out that 
many North African Jews 
were so unwilling to go to 
Israel that Zionists had to 
bomb synagogues to induce 
them to leave their homes. It 
cannot be overlooked that a 
major split within the Zionist 
movement occured because 
the hard·li ners within 
Zionist ranks insisted that 
resistance to Nazism was 
secondary to agitation for a 

Jewish state in Palestine. 
These things are certainly 
not what many Jews saw as 
their best interest and to 
accuse these Jew of hating 
their heritage, of being so 
traitorous as to be anti-Jew 
is grossly unfair. 

Therefore it cannot be 
over·emphasized that there is 
a real and significant 
difference between Jews and 
Zionists, even though well· 
meaning souls like Reverand 
King, and out -and ·out 
dictators like Hussein maybe 
confused about the issue. 

The letter seriously 
misrepresents history when 
it says that Palestinians were 

'Igi~en" a homeland in 1947, 
when the UN voted to 
partition Palestine into Israel 
and Jordan. Jordan is not 
Palestine . Historically 
Palestine is bordered by 
Jordan on the east; its 
northern border is formed by 
Syria and Lebanon ; its 
western border is the 
Mediterranean ; and the 
south is oordered by Sinai 
and the Gulf of Aquaba . In 
short, Palestine and the 
present state of Israel are 
territorially the same place. 
True, Jordan is over 70 
percent Palestinian, but only 
since 1948. Prior to that time, 
the Palestinians lived in the 
territory occupied by the 
Israelis. They were driven 
out at that time (1948) and 
most fled to Jordan. 

Wherever they fled to in 
the Arab world after 1948, 
the Palestinians have been 
denied the rights to 
citizenship. The letter was 
correct to observe that in 
1970, Jordan fought , killed 
and expelled many Palestini-
ans. But tosay there has been 
no outcry is to lie openly. 
Palestinians have protested 
bitterly to the governments 
involved and to the world as a 
whole throu~h their 
Palestinian LIberation 
Organization. It is hard to be 
heard from a refugee camp, 
but the Palestinians have 
been heard in the UN and 
elsewhere as well. 

The most serious distor-
tion in the letter is in the 
paragraphs dealing with how 
the land of Israel was 
acquired. The implication is, 

first, that it was all bought 
from people who were 
perfectly willing to sell it , and 
second, that it was 
uninhahited and in fact 
uninhabitable, prior to the 
time the Zionists came. The 
very first kibbutzim might 
have fit this description, but 
Israel today occupies the 
entire land that was once 
Palestine. and the Palestini-
ans who were expelled from 
this land number in the 
millions. Could a dustbowl 
have supported all these 
people? 

Certainly it could not have 
been a dustbowl that 
supported so many Palestini· 
ans. Palestine, prior to the 
arrival of the Zionists , 
contained olive groves, wells, 
cultivated fields. Many of the 
people who lived there had 

lived there for 10 and 20 
generations. Are we to 
believe that they lasted so 
long without a single 
vegetable? For that matter, 
are we to believe that the 
lands they had lived on for so 
many generations were in no 
way ancestral? 

Perhaps the Peel Report 
was just plain wrong. It 
disagrees with every single 
history that these authors 
have read and with common 
sense as well. It is clear that 
the British Director of 
Development had a very poor 
notion of the land of Palestine 
and its inhabitants if all he 
could sar about the fellahim 
is that i they wer~ 't cattle 
thieves, they haroored them. 
This is clearly a racist 
slander. How could anyone 
quote it? 

The letter attempts to 
create the impression that 
basically no one was living in 
Palestine and thatJew were 
a majority. Yet. in 1922, the 
census showed 663,000 Arabs 
compared to 83, 794 Jews. 
Palestine was anything but 
the "land without people for a 
people without land" that the 
Zionists liked to pretend it 
was. It was inhabited . 

According to the letter the 
PLO eliminates dissenters. 
Yet the organizations 
participating in this 
organization include group 
of not only laborers, students 
and women, but of political 
parties on extremes of right 
and left. The PLO is a 
government in exile, in which 
many political persuas ions 
ha ve a voice.

Zionism and its territorial 
claims are outrageous, ridiculous 
Editor: 

Spencer Klein has shown 
himself to be a proponent of 
Zionism, which is the belief 
that the Jews should have a 
homeland in Palestine. I 
personally think this is 
ridiculous and an outrageous 
lie. It's all part of the bigger 
lie that the Jews are the 
chosen people of God. But as 
Henry Ford Sr. wrote in his 
book The InternationaL Jew, 
this is the bi~est lie ever sold 
to the American people. 

The falseness of the idea 
that the Jews are the chosen 
people hinges on two facts. 
One is that the Jews are the 
nominal descendants of 
Judah and Benjamin, only 
two of the 13 tribes of Israel. 
Yet the Jews claim to be 
Israel, while the 10 (or 11) lost 
tribes of the house of Israel 
(Matt. 15:24) in reality 
ocnstitute the major portion 
of the Israel nation. 

Secondly, while claiming 
descendancy from Judah and 
Benjamin, very fewoftoday's 
Jews are true descendants of 
the House of Judah. They 
have integrated racially with 
many other peoples. The 
ZiOnist stakes his claim on 

the false notion that he is a 
descendant of those who once 
inhabited. Palestine. 

Evidence to the racial 
integration of Jews abound. 
The Jewish Encyclopedia 
makes reference to an entire 
kingdom of Mongolians. 
called Chazars , becoming 
Jews. H. G. Wells in his 
Outline of History verifies 
this fact, and adds that 
Judaism welcomed prosely· 
tite from every race such as 
Babylonians, Ammonites and 
Moabites, in addition toninth 
century Mongolians. 

The Bible records in Esther 
8:17 that "many of the land 
became Jews for fear of the 
Jews ." II Samuel 7:10, 
written at the time of Israel 's 
national height under King 
David, states that Israel (the 
whole 13 tribes) would yet 
receive a land of their own to 

. dwell in and be no more 
moved. This is not Palestine. 

They were in Palestine at the 
time t his promise was made. I 
believe this appointed place 
to be a place where Genesis 
48:19, Deuteronomy 15:6, 
28: 1-14, 33:28, Jeremiah 
51:19·23 and Hosea 1:10 could 
all happen, namely Europe 
and the United States of 
America. For years we so-
called Gentiles have been told 
we are not God's people, but 
we have been called sons of 
The Living God (IJohn 3:1). 

So don 't be fooled. Zionism 
is not of a~, for its members 
are deceived, and no lie is 
from God (I John 2:21, John 
14:6). Klein says Palestine 
"has been a light unto 
nations." What could be 
farther from the truth, when 
it has been America whjch for 
200 years has opened her 
arms to all, fed the poor, 
championed freedom and 
borne the name of "Jesus 
Christ, Our Lord."

The trial for Tolbert's tenure

made a number of highly 
debatable comments about 
Israel and Palestine, and also

But the charge of anti-

Jewish nationalism but 
supporting Palestinian 
nationalism. We did nothing 
of the kind. We supported the 
right of Palestinians to

specifically denied support of 
any nationalistic policy that 
Palestinians might adopt.

publications he has managed 
to produce and present before 
the administrative board at 
this university. 

On behalf of Professor 
Tolbert, let me state that this 
professor has a more than 
adequate amount of publica· 
tion in his field of study. His 
publication on the Garvey 
Movement of the 19208 is 
evidence of his ability to 
show a sufficient amount of 
expertise for tenure in this 
particular area . 

In addition to this 
publication , Professor 
Tolbert has received great 
review from various 
professors from other 
universities, as well as from 
individuals within the 
academic realm, concerning 
the great amount of 
knowledge he has displayed 
in writing on this subject. 

If thi profe or is again

quite obviously believes that 
Zionism, Judaism and the 
needs of Jewish people are all 
identites . Therefore, to 
oppose one is to oppose all 
three. We printed an anti-
Zionist article, and are thus 
accu~ed of anti-Semitism. 

We would like to point out 
that the charge of anti· 
Semitism disintegrates if it 
can be shown that Zionism is 
not identical with Jews and 
Judaism. We believe that we 
have demonstrated in our 
pages that Zionism is really 
contrary to the interests of 
Jews.

In conclusion, we would 
like to point out that the 
letter charging us with anti-
Semitism does not appear, in 
any way, to be based upon a 
reading of our article. We feel 
it highly irresponsible to 
respond to an article without 
reading it. In the future, we 
hope that our detractors will 
at least know what we have

Anyone interested in reading 
what we actually did publish,

welcome to pick up the New

Tolbert: another look 
Editor: 

May I address this letter 
directly to those afflicted 
with tunnel vision, those 
who are mi informed on the 
Tolbert issue, tho ewhoare 
unable to read between the 
lines - specifically Gianna 
Osc uro's recent letter 
(Guardian, March 30) on the 
subject. 

From the information 
given in letters to the editor 
like Kenny Overton's, the 
Guardian readers told of 
Professor Tolbert 's creden-
tials could draw the 
conclusion that indeed this 
man is qualified for a 
tenured po ition at UCSD. 
The question the individual 
reader should entertain is, 
" If this man is so qualified, 
why do s tudent s and 
organizations feel s o 
motivated as to create a 
public campaign, won't his 
accomplishments support 
him?" I answer, if Blacks 

were treated "fairly" there 
would be no need for Civil 
Rights Laws. Professor 
Emory Tolbert is Black. 

What I was attempting to 
convey in my previous letter 
(Guardian, March 9) was 
that he may be overlooked 
because his ancestry is 
African instead of Euro· 
pean. To put it in a plain 
way for Mr. Oscuro's and 
for other's benefit, color is 
holding Professor Tolbert 
back and that is not valid 
criteria. 

I mentioned the lack of 
minorities in the UC system 
a a last resort for opening 
the cO.lor conscious eyes of 
those' iJtl power to grant 
tenure. I don't believe in 
opening the back door to 
slide unqualified individu· 
als into school or employ· 
ment , I also don 't believe in 
labeling the door "for 
whites only."

Unlikely. 

The letter correctly quotes 
Article Nine of the PLO 
Covenant, but out of context 
this article is meaningless. It 
can only be understood when 
it is understood that the 
raison d'etre of \ the Israeli 
state is the Law of Return, 
which allows Jews from 
anywhere in the world to 
come to Israel and become 
citizens . Any Jew is eligible. 
Even the 5,000 Americans 
who oonverted to Judaism 
last year are eligible. Yet 
Palestinians who were born 
in what is now Israel, Safed, 
Jeru salem or Ramallah 
cannot return and become 
full citizens. 

inhabitant s. They are 
necessarily genocidal. The 
Americans killed off the 
Sioux and the Pima and the 
Yahi and all of the other 
people who originally 
inhabited the land we now 
call the USA. The Australi-
ans are effectively destroying 
their native populations. 
When land is conquered for 
purposes of immigration and 
settlement, it is necessarily a 
genocidal enterprise. 

In this light, the quotes 
frorn Fatah, Nashibi and 
others can be understood. 
Outside of it, they cannot be 
understood. It is ony when 
one realizes that the 
Palestinians are resisting an 
occupation that wishes to 
wipe them from the face of 
the earth that the necessity 
for Article Nine comes home. 
Zionism is not a movement 
that can be bargained with. It 
must be crushed absolutely. 
The Zionist movement is the 
enemy of whom Nashibi 
speaks and of whom Arafat 
speaks. 

Tolbert on trial here 

Article Nine can only be 
understood when it is 
understood that Israel is a 
Jewish state; for, by and of 
Jews. Indeed , when Mena· 
chem Begin addressed a 
world Zionist congre s in 
1948, he said, "You must kill 
your enemies and destroy as 
much as you can so that we 
can establish our pureJewish 
civilization on the ruin of 
the old Arab civilization." 

However, unless we are so 
anti-semitic as to believe that 
Israeli Jews cannot see 
through the racism that is 
Zionism; and unless we are so 
anti·semitic as to believe that 
Palestinians could not drop 
their guns were the Israelis to 
reject Zionism; there is no 
reason to believe that peace in 
the Middle East is not 
possible. Certainly Israeli 
Jews are intelligent enough to 
see that Zionism is not in 
their best interest. It 
automatically creates for 
them a positively desperate 
enemy who must kill them or. 
be killed by them. Certainly ' 
Palestinians are much more 
interested in living like 
human beings than in killing

questions raised as to how 
professors of co lor are 
reviewed for tenure by this 
university . The steady 
di s appearance of Black 
professors s uch as Dr. 
Tolbert and other professors 
of color (a decrease from 36 to 
18 since 1974) who are denied 
tenure is evidence of a 
systematic effort by the 
UCSD administration to bar 
these professors (Ngu bo, 
Romo, Anderson and others) 
from further teaching in the 
future at this university. 

UCSD's poor record of 
maintaining these kinds of 

UCSD 
3100 Gilman Drive 
La Jolla, CA 92037 

professors in becoming a part 
of the tenured faculty can 
weigh heavily on how the 
admnini s tration may be 
biased in their decisions on 
granting tenure to certain 
racial groups within the 
UCSD faculty. The univer· 
~ity administration has 
managed to build a barrier 
through a continuous line of 
rhetoric to become so 
conducive that all other 
profes s ors , staff, and 
students believe that this is 
the way things should be 
concerning tenure for certain 
professors. 

The evidence lies in the 

(on Warren Campus across from VA Hospital) 
(714) 453-5620 

decrease in professors of 
color at this university since 
1974 as well as in the small 
amount of already tenured 
professors at UCSD from the 
non·white majority. 

The evidence is now all in. 
The final decision concerning 
Dr. Tolbert is left up to the 
admini trative faculty. The 
guilt or innocence of the 
UCSD administration in 
keeping professors of color 
barred from this university 
will be determined in their 
decision to rule in favor or not 
in favor of tenure for this 
professor. The defense rests.

a variety of support services, 
including tutoring and 
intensive workshops, and a 
placement or diagnostic test

In composition, each

Funds used to provide both 

courses and special programs 
for underprepared students 
come from the state, student

The Housing and Food 
services committee assigned 
to investigate allegedly racist 
working conditions in the 
Muir Cafeteria, has delivered 
a formal report of its findings 
to Herm Johnson, vice 
chancellor of business and 
financial management. 

Neither Johnson nor Marco

CSEA who represents the 
nine Muir workers , were 
willing to comment on the 
content of the report . 

According to an unidenti·

Vice chancellor Johnson 
expects the case to be 
resolved by late April, and 
until then , Holly Holmes,

Police close 
Senate nteetings 
EPC says observers 
inhibit open discussion 

The Executive and Police 
Committee voted unani· 
mously Tuesday to close all 
commIttee meetings of the 
Academic Senate. 

Their decision , made in the 
wake of confrontations over 
the matter earlier this year, 
reaffirmed current policy, 
which restricts members of 
the press and public from 
attending committee meet· 
ings. 

EPC members argued that 
the presence of observers 
inhibits free and J open 
com mittee discussion." 

They also charged that 
reporters are apt to misquote 
or misrepresent statements 
made by comittee members, 
and suggested that members 
of the press and public do not 
need to know the proceedings 
of senate committees. 

One of the more outspoken 

opponents to opening 
meetings was Chemistry 
Department Chairman 
Murray Goodman, who said 
that the press rarely reports 
events accurately. 

He and other members also 
argued that the presence of 
journalists and members of 
the public could intimidate 
faculty members from 
participating in Academic 
Senate committees. 

History Professor Stanley 
Chodorow, who often sides 
with Goodman, said that the 
university is not a democracy 
and that as a consequence, 
committees are justified in 
remaining closed. Such 
closure ensures efficiency, he 
added. 

Alien policy studied 

The EPC agreed to address 
the question of closed 
meetings at the request of the 
Guardian, which has been 
denied access to Academic 
Senate meetings for the past 
two months. 

This denial prompted the 
newspaper to seek the 
assistance of the American 
Civil Liberties Union, which 
has agreed to pursue the case. 

The legal and soci al 
ramifications of the 
recommendations for 
overhauling US immigration 
policy made recently by the 
Select Commission on 
Immigration and Refugee 
Policy will be discussed at a 
special roundtable at UCSD 
on Friday, April 17. 

The roundtable , convened 
by the Program in United 
States·Mexican Studies, will 
be held from 10 am to noon in 
the conference room of 
Building 402 on the Warren 
campus.

AS slates given for 
late April election 

College Bowl is set 
for tonight at Revelle 

continued fnml page 1 
Immediately noted by campaign 

observers Monday was the absence of 
a si lly students slate in the large fi eld 
of candidates. 

Last year, t he visible and 
en tertaining campaign of the "Very 
Silly Students" s late, behind 
presidential con· tender (and victor) 
Charlton, spiced up the election and 
handed four out of the s late' even 
members AS posts . 

Only one silly student elected , 
however, Activity Fee Commis ioner 
Todd Thomp on, remained on the 
Council for his entire term. Cindi 
Biondi, Meg Honda and finally 
Charlton resigned early in their 
tenure. 

The names of two of t}1e 
eight slates formed for this electIOn 
uggest a silly approach to student 

government - Rational Party and 
Immoral Minority - but slate 
members insist that 's not the case. 

"I do believe we're a lot more 
lighthearted about our campaign than 
some of the other candidates, who 
seem to be awfully easily provoked ," 
sa id Rational Party presidential 
contender Matt Adams. "But we're 
not a silly slate." 

Adams ays he and slate partners 
Thomas Doupe (vice president) and 
David Tollner (activity fee) believe 
this year's AS has "made some gross 
misappropriations" of the $6 fee 
students pay their government. 

"We plan to behave in a rational 
economic way, providing more for the 
largest number of students," says 
Adams. 

And the. Immoral Minority group, 
while getting some laughs for its 
name, is in no way silly about its 
message. 

" We're essentially concerni ng 
ourselves with co nfron ting 
Reaganism," says slate pre idential 
candidate Jon Bekken. 

Bekken, who unsuccessfully ran for 
Activity Fee Commissioner last year 
on the Progressive Coalition s late, is 
running with current AS activity fee 
commi s ioner Thomp on (vice 
president), Mark Seecoff (communica' 
tion ) a nd Mitch Thomp on 
(election ). 

Among the six other slates, "Action: 
Not Reaction " boasts the most 
experience. Three of its four members 
- Pam Gerber, Toby Raymond, Mitch 
Sosna - currently serve on the AS 
Council , an d the fourth, [rene Flores, 
was Chairwoman of the Third College 
Council last year . 

"We plan to take action on issues 
and programs here, in tead of 
condemning or reacting to things like 
student government always seems to 
do," say Sosna, explains his slate's 
name. 

AS Programming Commissioner 
Josh Harris heads the five·members 
Student Slate as its candidate for 
president. 

Behind the s logan , 'Vote for 
yourself,' Student Slate members 
hope to convince voters they are "just 
a bunch of students" who want to see 
more money to ~o to programming, an 
area they feel IS of high priority to 
student here, says Harris. 

"I don't think students worry about 
whether the AS is tructured well or 
not," says Harris. "They want to see 
the $6 per quarter they give serve 
them."

with six members the largest in the 
race , "would like to make the AS

Problems 
for kids 
continued from page I 
listened to· the pOlice warn of 
the dangers of child 
molestation. Nevertheless, 
the problem persist, and 
show no signs of abating. 

"Since the area cannot be 
adeq uately patroled, the only 
solution is to remove 
potential victims from the 
area," Duffy says. "In order 
to do thi , parents are going 
to have to organize car pools 
or petition for bus service to 
and from schools ." 

Duffy i perplexed that 
some individuals perceive 
certain types of child 
molestation as not affecting 
the impressionable young· 
ster. "I argued with one 

~rincipal who maintained 
that such molestation is a 
victim Ie s crime, in that the 
child is unable to understand 
what is t ranspiring." 
Clearly, Duffy disagrees. 

"Such an argument i 
incomprehensible to me. 
given the types of behavior of 
some of these individuals," 
he says. 

Du ffy related a recent 
occurance as an example of 
the activities of orne child 
molesters. 

"There was a suspect 
about two weeks ago who 
stood by the playground gate 
as children were Jeaving for 
home. dressed in nothing but 
a white towel and mutilating 
himself in the stomach with a 
sharp object." The suspect 
evaded apprehension. 

Duffy hopes that con-
cerned parents, particularly 
UCSD st udents whose 
children attend area schools, 
will become involved in 
assisting police in preventing 
the victimization of their 
children. 

Jews 
continued from page 3 
for its own sake. If Israelis 
were to reject a Jewish state 
for a democratic one, where 
everyone would have equal 
rights and responsibilities, 
certainly Palestinians would 
want to live in it. They would 
have no need to shoot. 

If you think that Israeli 
Jews and Palestinians are not 
capable of these things, then 
you think that neither of 
these people is capable of 
being fully human. That is 
anti-semitism of the worst 
kind. which must be resented 
by Jews and by Palestinians 
and all who abhor racism.

Woman raped by friend Ba,sic 
Only resort is a civil suit. she is told skzlls 

continued from page 1 
that they Jed the man on, that 
they teased him, and that is 
unfair to suppress the man's 
uncontrollable desires. 

"In order for a woman to 
talk about an acquaintance· 
rape, a woman may be asked 
to identify herself publicly as 
a sexual person. And the 
double standard is still alive 
and well in this society," 
Levens says. Thus, a woman 
may be inclined to not report 
!.,eing raped under such 
circumstances.

But this woman had no 
second thoughts about 
reporting the crime . "I 
wanted to get him arrested. I 
would have gone to any 

len~h or extreme to get the 
rapist legally." 

And that's precisely what 
she plans to do. Since it may 
be impossible to get this man 
on criminal charges, she is 
now preparing a civil lawsuit 
against him on charges of 
assault. 

The reason for suing him is 
not so much for the money, 

she said, but rather to" how 
him that he can't get away 
with it." 

And although thi woman 
till encounter her assailant 

daily at work, she said that 
she is not afraid of putting 
him through "as much hell as 
possible. " 

"It is not uncommon for a 
woman who has been raped 
to sue her assailant for 
punitive damages a a result 
of the attack," says Student 
Legal Services attorney Nick 
Aguilar. 

"Sometime the police wiJI 
recommend tothevictim that 
s he file civi l suit when they 
don't think that they have a 
substantial criminal case. " 

Criminal conviction, notes 
Aguilar , does not guarantee 
restitution to the rape victim . 
Normally a personal injury 
suit is initiated for assualt 
and battery naming the 
rapist as the defendant. Some 
authorities contend that this 
is the on ly recourse available 
to casual-acquaintances rape 
victims when criminal 
prosecution is infeasible.

Boycott Coors 
WHEREAS: the Adolf Coors Brewing Company has engaged in 
the vicious harrassment of minorities, unions, working people, 
persons with alternative lifestyles, and individuals ~ith any 
political beliefs different from those of the Coors family; and, 
WHEREAS: the Coors Brewery has consistently actualized its 
beliefs through repressive tactics at both its brewery in 
Colorado and in Southern California; and, 
WHEREAS: those tactics include personal locker searches, lie 
detector tests, refusal to hire women and ' minorities, pre-
employment questionnaires which delve into such irrelevant 
areas as a person's sexual proclivities and political bel iefs; and, 
WHEREAS: the actions of the Coors Brewing Company have 
resulted in the loss of pension credits, health and welfare 
coverage and other benefits for workers and their famil ies; 
THEREFORE, Be It Resolved that the ASUCSD strongly supports 
the Boycott of all Coors products; that it urges all students to

Furthermore, Be It Resolved that although it is only with the

Intercollegiate athletes unite to form TlAA 
Main goal is to solidify sports program 

BY BOB McSPADDEN 
SporlS Edilor 

When a student enters 
UCSD he or he is familiar 
with the beach, the excellent 
academic reputation and the 
unparalleled climate. The 
only thing missing, ome wiJJ 
contend, i an intercollegiate 
athletics program almost ' 
naturally a part of an 
institution this size. 

Mark the time: Monday 
n~ht ~ 10 pm , UCSD 
became home of the Triton 
Intercollegiate Athletic 
Association. 

Aside from the "Letter· 
man's Club" in 1967, UCSD 
has never had an organiza· 
tion like this. 

Now, with the help of 
va rious intercollegiate 
coaches, an association of 

athletes representing UCSD 
in intercollegiate sports ha 
been formed . 

The TIAA set its main goal 
Monday night a s the 
organization and olidifica-
tion of the intercollegiate 
sports program and intercol-
legiate athletes at UCSD. 

Head basketball coachJohn 
Block explains, "One of the 
biggest things lackmg at 
UCSD is pride in athletics," 
The association will work 
towards involving athletes in 
the entire sports program on 
campus, and not only in the 
individual sports. When this 
involvem nt i attained , an 
athlete will feel like an 
athlete for the entire year and 
not just during his or her 
parti<plir season, 

UCSl' definitely has the 

opportunity to build a large 
sports program. 

"The main drawback here 
is that athlet ics have been too 
spread out ," volleyball coach 
Doug Dannevik says. 

" If athletes can organize 
themselves into a cohesive 
group, they will know what is 

Commentary 
happening with all sport on 
campus, A group like this will 
also have the clout and 
determination to go before 
the community and admini· 
stration for support with 
much more voice than 
individuals," he says, 

One may question why an 
association like this has 

Wotnen's softball victorious 
B Y MIKE FISCHER 
Last Tues day , the 

women's softball team 
overcame an early t hrust 
by a strong Point Lorna 
team, rallying to win 8·3. 

After being down 2·0 in 
t he ear ly going, the 
Tritons put on a dazzling 
display of teamwork on 
both offense and defense, 
Led by Shirley Johnson 
and Margie Salem combin· 
ed with excellent baserun-
ning by Shirley Kidd a nd 
the strong pitching of 
Jeanie Lopez, UCS D 

managed the come from 
behind victory. 

Coach Steve Bacich 
commented, "the opposi· 

tion was stiff, but we 
really came on strong," 

I n t he season the 
T r itons post a 4-5 overall 

ONEG 

mark with a 1-2 record in 
league competition. Point 
Lorna had been regarded 
as the team to beat, 
posting an excellent record 
and a very strong team. 
The win enables the team 
a shot at a first place tie if 
they win their remaining 
three games. With the 
added confidence of this 
win , the team embarks on 
a busy schedule facing 
USC at home on Thurs-
day LA Baptist away 
Fnday a nd Loyola over the 
weekend.

Song of Songs 

never before been formed at 
UCSD? There is no clear 
answer. Athletics on campus 
have been gai ning in 
popularity but at a very slow 
rate, and until now a very 
cohesive effort by the 
athletes themselves ha 
never arisen. 

The Lettermen's Club in 
1967 only sported 22 
members , and although it 
was an optimistic effort, it 
really never "got off the 
ground ," Dannevik says. 

The possibilities proposed 
at Monday's TIAA meeting 
were enormous, and rightly 
so, No question that a school 
until now built chiefly on 
academics has a great deal to 
gain from a respectable 
athletics program. But at the 
present the possibilities are 

just that, possibili ties, and 
little can be achieved by the 
30 athletes who showed up 
Monday night. 

A five-member committee 
volunteered to help inform 
athletes on the association 's 
goals and benefits before the 
next meeting on April 20. 

Sound impressive? Chan-
ces are that the Triton 
Intercollegiate Ath letic 
Association has something to 
prove and very little to lose. 
UCSD can incorporate a good 
athletic program with a fine 
academic system, much the 
same as sister schools UCLA, 
UC Irvine and UC Davis. As 
Dannevik says, "there is a lot 
of ground to be broken, but 
no better time to do it than 
now."

BY MIKE T HOMAS 
Un repentant functional-

ism has reigned supreme in 
modern architecture for the 
last 50 years or so. Artifice 
and embellishment were 
senten ced to an architectural 
gulag long a~o while the 
sleek, modern Ideal of can do 
efficiency (exemplified by the 
work of Le Corbusier) pread 
aero s the globe as proof-
po itive of the triumph of 
heroic materialsim. 

In the la t two decade , 
however, thi en e of man 
dominating his environment 
in order to create something 
like a New ]eru alem has 
undergone serious scrutiny. 

Coming out of the void 
created by a general 
suspicion about architectural 
functionalsim was a group of 
renegade architects in New 
York in the late 60s. Rather 
than seeing architectu r e 

merely as a mooium for 
perfunctory technological 
design , their commitment 
was to art. Known collective-
ly as SITE, they are currently 
exhibiting their work in the 
Mandeville Gallery. They 
have con cious ly gone 
again t the prevailing legacy 
of European modernism by 
creating a kind of 'meta· 
architecture' that goes 
beyond merely solving the 
problems of shelter, space 
and design. 

In the last 10 years, 5I TE 
has become identifioo with a 
new styleof architecture that 
comment s on itself, the 
environment in which it 
exists and , most importantly, 
society at large. This is quite 
a feat con idering the elitist 
nature of the bulk of modern 
design

exhibit 

Two of the best examples of "SITE' architectural hum or. 

of a Best edifice, which had 
the lower left hand corner of 
the building removed . With 
the missing fragment et on 
rails which could be rolled 
back into the wall at closing 
t ime, the design was 
functional. The wonderful 
perversity of the design set 
me laughing out loud. 

Mandeville exhibition 
features photograph and 
drawings of many SITE 
building and unrealized 
project ,a well a a film 
documenting the group's 
accompli hments. All of thi 
is et in aeon truction area in 
the gallery itself, an 
atmosphere complete with 
hard· hats, bricks, mortar and 
graffiti-strewn barri cades. 
Yet this i not a comooy 
convention, where crazed 
de igner chortle over their 
latest SITE gags. True, a 

en e of surrealistic 

displacement is at work here, 
but it evolves out of a firm 
commitment to the notion 
that architecture must be 
aware of its environment and 
its impact upon society. 

SITE incorporates time 
into design; by introducing 
the element of decay into its 
work (which i not a new 
idea, a mid-18th century 
aw s lavish replica of 
decre~il Gothic !>uildings). 

Despite the disdain of more 
co nformi t architecture, 
SITE ha achieved its 
profe sed goal: to give new 
life to an art form that has 
become stagnant, to treat 
architecture a sculpture, to 
touch human emotions and to 
reach out to people rather 
than treat them as after-
thoughts ..

Ballet group excels 
at Mandeville show 
For each of the dances the 

Hartford BaIlet performed 
last Sunday night , t h 
company created a mood. For 
each. they led the audience 
into a sort of dreamlike or 
nightmarish reality. 

The Hartford Ballet 
creates a style of dance which 
is not ballet and not modern . 
but somewhere in-between . 
They com bine balleti c 
technique with some sharp. 
striking movement , and some 
wavelike motion characteris-
tic of modern dance. They are

actors as well as dancers, and 
the dramat ic effect of their 
dance pulls the audience into 
their art. 

Of th e four dances 
performed, "Duo" was most 
like a dream, "Tom Dula" 
most like a nightmare. "Duo" 
began with the image of a

Brooks' 'Romance' 
I is too serious 

BY WILLIAM HAMILTON 
Starr Writer 

If the once-popular 
television series, Love 
American-Style were 
resurrected and updated, 
Albert Brooks' Modern 
Romance would be the 
obvious choice for a skit. 

Modern Romance is a 
satirical look at a love affair 
between a Hollywood film 
editor (Brooks) and the 
resplendent, gorgeous bank 
officer (Kathryn F -rold), a 
love affair . Ich is 
frequently. pUT lated by 
breaking up onl~. ,,>ult in 
partial reconciltatioll "en 
film editor Robert (;(}.~ 
decides that he is hopelessly 
in love. He would wish her 
happiness apart from him 
though - providing that 
she is as miserable as he is 
without her.· ' 

The film attempts to 
stress the characterization 
of Cole as a subclinical 
obses si ve personal i ty, 
toxically -im bued with 
positive thinking to the 
point that the viewer is 
either forced to discard the 
character's credibility or 
actively seek psychothera-
py himself. Wishy-washy . 
would hardly be an 
adequately perjorative label 
for Cole, who, during the 
twenty-four hour period 
between the split he IS sure 
is final . .... makes feeble 
attempts to · resume a 
normal exis tence apart 
from hi s beloved_ 

Cole tries vitamins, 
jogging, auto-su~estion 
and drugs to rid himself of 
the nagging impulse to 

reconcil'e, but finally 
succumbs to the ultimate 
realization that he is 
hooked . Following the kiss-
and-make-up sequence, the 
relationship once again 
deteriorates into jealous 
paranoia on the part of Cole, 
and appears to be on the 
ver~ of disintegrating once 
agam before Cole arrives at 
a solution. 

It is to the credit of 
Brooks, who co-wrote the 
screenplay, directed and 
starred in the film, that an 
attempt was made to 
realistically examin~ such a 
• : I:ttionshir and to utilize 
see,,: i ng y universal 
emotions and interactions 
between characters . In this 
respect, Modern Romance is 
an attempt at social realism, 
despite its given preten-
tions. (I'm still waiting for a 
popular look at boardwalk 
roman~ which maintains 
the dignity of the lower 
class - such as it has -
without sacrificing realism. 
I'm tired of seeing Porsche's 
and Gucci's), 

Still , a s previou s 
attempts at capturing the 
nuances of 'real life ' have 
a bortively demonstrated , 
there is no substitute for 
slapstick comedy to keep 
the pace moving_ And there 
is no su bstitute for a 
coherent st.oryline to 
~nerate and hold viewer 
mterest. 

In many respect s, Modern 
Romance can be said to be a 
dialogue looking for a plot to 1''' ...... 11I1"1"l'a~l ' 1:1

The dance is filled with 
romance. as if t he two lover 
had met in a dream_ The use 
of flexed hands and kn sand 
the undulating movement of 
the arms demon s trat e a 
modern style of dance. But 
the grace with which it is 
performed and the weight -

man's arm, shows a trong 
balletic technique. 

lust a t he white veil in 
"Duo" created a dre;lmlike 
cenerio. the browni h grey 

skirts of the village women in 
'Tom Dula." held high above 
their h eads, created an 
ominous feeling of approach-
ing death. The piece was 
purely dramatic . Each 
movement described a word 
or emotion, out lining the 
tragic s tory of Tom Dooley , 
hanged for the murder of his 
lover . She~iff G rayson's 
backward roll of one shoulder 
and the sharp turn of his 
head in t he direction of Tom 
Dooley and his fiancee Ann 
Melton showed his jealousy. 
Ann Melton's wild tu rns and 
flinging arms demonstrated 
her distre after Tom wa 
hanged . 

[n "Leggieros," Lotte 
Goslar u ed pantam ime and 
characterization , but here it 
was to intensify t he humor 
and satirical effect of his 
dance. These short skits, 
performed to Beethoven ' 
"Diabelli Variations, " were 
light, comical and entertain-
ing. 

Balenchine's " Allegro 
Brillante" was theonlydance 
with no implied story or 
characterization. The irony 
of the ,dance clearly defined 
the Hartford's s tyle. The 
costumes were class ical : 
women in pastel dresses and 
point shoes, men in beige 
tights and puffed sleeved 
shirts . One would have 

.expe€ted a slow and graceful 
banet. The dance, however, 
was performed to Tchaikov-
sky's music al high speed 
with many short , staccato 
movements_ 

By opening with this piece, 
the Hartford Ballet appeared 
to be stating its individuality, 
impre sing on the audience 
that althou~h it knew the 
rules of theIr art, it felt no 
need to adhere to them.

Jerry Lewis returns as the original jerk in 'Hardly Working' 

Lewis' 'Hardiy Working' 
hardly \Vorksat all 

Watching Jerry Lewis' first 
feature comedy in ten years, 
Hardly Workinf', is like 
taking a short tnp in a time 
machine back into the mid-
Sixties, but who wants to go 
to the mid·Sixties? Hardly

a .marvelous beginning and 
probably the worst possible 
mistake Lewis made in 
putting . together his new 
film. After this opening of 
magical moments, we are 
faced with a film of fair 
moments at best, and Hardly 
Working never overcomes the 
handicap of having to 
compete with the past. 

romances the bo ss's 
daughter and eats the boss's

yearning to be a clown 
surfaces in a singularly 
idiotic sequence and Hardly

Looks are very important

Records/Ted Burke 

Old Miles better than no Miles 
BY TED BURKE 

Arts Editor 
Directions - Miles Davis 
(Columbia) 

Like last year's Circle In 
The Round, Directimls is 
another double record 
anthology of previously 
unreleased Davis material 
from 1960-70, and it's neatly 
divided between the coaly 
lyrical post-bop styles and the 
period when the trumpeter 
led his musicians into the 
wilds of polyrhythmic jazz-
rock. For my part, I prefer the 
latter of the two styles on the 
fir t two ides, highlighting 
Davis' sharp, pointillistic 
brassiness and severa l 
swinging performances from 
Wayne Shorter, Hank 
Mobley, Ron Carter and 
others. The fusion material 
tends to drift too far afield, 
lost as it is around funk riffs 
that are annoyingly station-
ary while improvisations, by 

Davis. John McLaughlin , 
Wayne Shorter and Steve 
Goodman, lack anything to 
say save for arbitrary 
utterances. One jam, "Willie 
Nelson ," do 1' , however. 
transcend the hit-and-mi s 
method of the sty le that has 
bassist Dave Holland 
elevating a simple figure into 
something truly propulsive 
that in turn inspires 
McLaughlin to give his best 
guitar work-out on the four 
record set. Still, the fusion 
essions are stiff and 

unmotivated, and one 
wonders whether Davis 
himself would have allowed 
thes tracks to see light. 
Sides one and two, though, 
are quite fine, and well worth 
the price of the package. B. 

Intensities hI Ten Cities -
Ted Nugent (Epic) 

I used to think that Nugent 
was a rock guitarist of 

'Modern Romance' 
conlinut'd from page 15 
develop in, hence the earlier 
comparison with Love 
American-Style. Too little is 
divulged about the history 
of the relationship to offer 
sufficient insight into the 
situation, and the character 
of bank teller Mary Harvard 
is barely developed itself 
during the course of the 
story. In addition , the 
eqilogue seems to be a 
rather cop-out way of 
attempting to unify the 
preceeding events. 

Apt1I' a1. 
I ... ,., CiIIc TIIuIrc 

The attempt - however 
dubious its eventual 
success - to portray such a 
romance without becoming 
zany or chemerical is indeed 
laudable, and with Brooks' 
capable portrayal of Cole, 
almost succeeds as a serious 
piece of film. 

But sadly, the screenplay 
bereft of substantial plot 
and inadequate character 
development relegates 
Modern Roma~ce to just · 
that - a serious piece of 
film.

Nugent i a good guitarist , 
but rve abandoned all hope 
that he might garner orne 
class. Intensities hI Ten Cities 

is more of what he' been 
serving up the last . ix years 
or so: songs in major keys 
using major chords with lots 
of screami ng guitar work and 
plenty of lyrics that display 
no more odal conscience 
than a back alley brawl. 
Nugent is obviously very 

happy to remain where he is, 
his audience seems more 
than happy to be typified as 
bone heads of the first order, 
and presently I'm more than 
happy to ignore this me . 
Give the audience what it 
wants and then wash the

How to tell the difference 
in the dark. 

I S lince this is a 
college newspaper, 
this is an educational 
ad. About dark beer. 
Or more specificaUy, about 
the two ways to make 
beer dark. 

San Migue l 

M ethod -1: Add caramel coloring. 
M ethod - 2: Gather the best barley malt 

obtainable. Slowly deep.r ast it, taking care not 
to scorch or char it. Add pure brewing water and 
work the mash at appropriate temperatures for 
several hours, stirring constantly. Filter out the 
spent grain. Add a pinch of your best hops to 
re ultant dark wort while boiling, then pump to 
setding tank and add pure brewer's yeast, cultured 
from your own special strain . Ferment for 7-10 
days, recovering resultant natural carbonation for 
re-carbonation just prior to bottling, Transfer dark 
beer to storage cellars for maturation and aging, 
Age for several weeks at approximately OOC, then 
filter. Transfer bright dark beer to bot des, Cap 
tightly and pasteurize to protect quality. Chill 
and enjoy. 

I w I hile Method # I may be a convenient 
shortcut, we prefer Method #2 be' 

cause we believe it results in a better dark 
beer. We think you will too, now that you know 

, the difference. If 
'you'd like to find 

out who's been using 
Method # 1, here's what 

to look for, Real dark 
Brand X beer is really dark. Not just 

sort of dark. True roasted 
barley malt substantially darkens the entire 
beer. Including the head , Caramel coloring, 
on the other hand, doesn't sit as well at 
the top. So when beer has been darkened by 
imply adding caramel coloring, its head 

doesn't show as much color. If you want 
further proof, have someone turn off the 
lights, You can smell and taste the difference 
in real dark - in its deep,roasted aroma and 
flavor, and in its smooth, rich, creamy body. 

INlow that you know how beers are 
made dark, we think you'll prefer a 

real dark beer. We've been making ours 
since 1890. We call it 
San Miguel. 

Sanmt9ud 
Classic beer of the Paci 

P.S. San Miguel also makes a delicious 
light lager. orne aficionado even go so for 
as to mix it in equal parts with our

Woman is 
assaulted 

A woman staff member 
was assalted yesterday 
afternoon at around 1:25 pm 
in a women's bathroom at the 
School of Medicine 's 
Teaching Facilities building, 
campus police aid yesterday. 

r lllice added that t he sus-
pect was not apprehended. 

According to police the 
assailant allegedly entered 
the bathroom and waited for 
the woman to emer~e from 
the stall. When she dId so, he 
blocked her exit, standing in 
front of the door. She then 
pushed him aside with an 
elbow to the stomach and 
fled. 

The suspect i described as 
a white maJe, early to mid 
twenties, 5'11", 175Ibs., with 
light brown hair. Police ask 
that anyone who might have 
seen this suspect in the 
vicinity contact them 
immediately. 

Lewis fails 
in new film 
'Working' 
continued from page 16 
played Mudd in several Slat 
Trek television shows) back 
on the screen. 

As far as Lewis' writing 
and directing abilities go, he 
lifts ~ags from everyone, 
includmg himself (In one of 
the films successful 

. moments, he reworks his 
Joyride in a jetliner from The 
Bellboy with the Goodyear 
blimp) and sends the film 
through its paces in a creaky, 
old-fashioned style. Hardly 
Working is much better than 
some of his late-Sixties 
disasters, but still a 
dissappointment from a man 
who, If he had left some of the 
work for others, could have 
hit the comedic bullseye with 
a greater regulari ty and 
developed his character intoa 
consistent and dependable 
funster.

Campaigns vary in AS elections 
continued from page 5 
legitimate to students for its actions ," 
according to former AS member Jules 
Bagneris, the slate's candidate for 
president. 

"For too long the AS has been 
legitimate in name only," says 
Bagneris. "We hope to gain respect for 
the AS through our own perspective." 

The three remaining slates -
"Open, Honest and Hardworking," 
"Liberal Coalition," "Students for a 
Change" - are not running 
candidates for president. 

As usual, there is no lack of 

candidates for AS executive position , 
six each for president and vice 
president. But student interest in 
college representative post on the 
Council this year is low. 

"We only had three names for 
college rep by the deadline Monday, 
so we had to give the colleges an 
extens ion to encourage more 
applicants," said Marietta Wi l1iams of 
the AS office. 

But by the 1:30 pm Tuesday 
deadline, only four more student -
three from Muir and one from Third 
- had declared their candidacy. In 
order to fill the vacant college rep 
spots, the college councils will have to 

submit names to the new AS Council 
for approval after the election. 

One event the current AS Council 
has scheduled for next Thursday, 
April 16, a constitutional convention, 
could complicate the election. At the 
convention, open to all UCSD 
students, revisions of the current AS 
constitutions and entirely new 
government structural proposals will 
be discussed. 

At least two new constitutions 
created by the AS Council members 
call for a revamping of the presen t AS 
and the institution of a bicameral 
system, which has no place for a 
president.

"This could a real big campaign 
issue," says AS Comissioner of 
Student Welfare Reggie William . 
" Depending on their position, 
candidates could use maintaining or 
changing the government in their 
campaigns. " 

The election will be held April 22 
and 23. Should a run-off election be 
necessary ( a run-off is held if a 
candidate for an office fails to get 50 
percent of the vote) it will be held the 
following week. 

Polling booths will be located at the 
Muir Cafeteria, the Third snack bar, 
the Bookstore, the Main gym steps 
and the Revelle cafeteria.
