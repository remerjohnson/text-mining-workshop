Penasq u itos 
park land may 
be developed 

ClncIbi Hill 
Staff Writer 

Approximately 2600 acres of land, 
presently designated for the Los 
Penasquitos Regional Park. may be 
slated for residential development by 
the San Diego City Council pending 
thei r upcoming decision. 

The council will consider a "land 
survey" plan proposed by Penasquitos 
Inc., present owners of the canyon, on 
Nov. 29. 

The proposal , a land use plan 
privately financed by land owner and 
Developer Penasquitos Inc., offers the 
City 500 acres for use as park in 
exchange for development rights 
along the canyon floor and slopes. 

Undeveloped coastal canyon 
Los Penasquitos Canyon is the last 

undeveloped coastal canyon in an 
urban area in Southern California. 
Presently, it is zoned as an agricul-
tural area and is slated as a 3,730 acre 
regional, natural resource based park 
in the city's 1973 Open Space Element 
of the city's general plan. It is also 
defined as permanent open space for 
public aquisition in the proposed 
Growth Management Plan. 

Although the area has been Slated as 
park land in the city'~ General ~lan 
si nce 1965, the ,City Planntng 
Department Ita not been budgeted or 
assigned to plan the park. 

A 1,000 acre park 
If the city accepts the Penasquitos 

Inc. proposal, the 500 acres thef offer 
will combine with approximately 600 
ac resof park land previously 
purchased by the county to create a 
1,000 acre park. 

Mayor Wilson has not taken a 
definite position on the canyon issue, 
although in 1972. while running for 
mayor he rejected a similar plan 
proposed by former owner Irvin Kahn 
stating in his State of, the City 
Message, "We plan to acquire this 
(canyon) for a regional park, rather 
than open it up for development."

The Federal Bureau of Investiga-

1968, asked the FBI's Washington 
headquarters for permission to help a 
Republican assemblyman from 
Encinitas try to force the dismissal of 
a UCSD faculty member, according to 
papers recently released by the 
bureau.

Heavily-censored 

Saxon aftermath: Criticism 
of a "limited president" 

by Laura A. Rich&er 
News Edi&or 

In a random survey of 20 UCSD 
professors, who generally preferred to 
remain anonymous , a feeling of 
discontent was confirmed in the 

hell being the animal, but it doesn't do 
me any good to hear how tough life is. 
You're paid to do a professional job." 

Headless mons&er 
Saltman, when asked if the UC 

system resembles a headless monster 
because of ineffective leadership , 
replied, " There is a head . His name is 
David Saxon. But UCLA and Berkeley 
are the whole show." 

The San Diego office's anti-" New 
Left" campaign, which consists of 
only 51 pages in the heavily censored 
COINTELPRO releases , relied 
mainly on fake leaflets, anonymous 
letters and harrassment tactics 
directed against antiwar groups and 
individuals, according to the file . 

, aftermath of UC President David 
Saxon's Tuesday appearance befon:: 
the Academic Senate. 

Vice-chancellor of Academic 
Affairs Paul Saltman, who actively 

-confronted Saxon with criticism 
during the meeting, remained in 
objection to the President's approach 
to the issues. "I feel badly that Ihadto 
take him nose to nose on some points, 
but I don't tielieve that you can waffle 
the issues. He was evasive." 

One anonymous professor stated 
that " Saxon treats UCSD like a second 
class citizen university. " 

While no names appear on the 
November. 1968 memo, state Sen. 
JohnStull (R-Escondido), whowasthe 
assemblyman from Encinitas in 1968, 
led a public campaign in the late 
sixties for the dismissal of Herbert 
Marcuse, the internationally-known 
Marxist who taught philosophy at 
UCSD at the time. 

Commenting on Saxon's expressed 
feeling of limitation in his position as 
president, Saltman stated, "I hate like 

Roy Pearce, professor of literature, 
found disappointment in Saxon's 
presentation . He felt that the 
President was not well briefed on the 
problems that face UCSD and "we 
asked him a number of questions to 
which he was only generally or 
vaguely responsive ." .

The San Diego FBI office wanted to 
send an anonymous letter to the 
assemblyman, which would include 
information "concerning the 
communist leanings and participation

Most students still have not 
answered Reg Fee's 50S call 

Only 20 percent f the students 
who received a questionnaire 
on programs and services 
funded by Registration Fee 
money had returned the survey 
as of last Wednesday. 

Ann Carberry, the Advisory 
Committee on Student Fee 
Programs' intern coordinator, 
who devUed the survey, said 
last eek less than 300 of the 
1450 students randomly 
selected by computer to receive 
the survey had returned it to the 
Student Affairs Office. 

The official last day for 
returnin, the "Student Opinion 
Survey," which was mailed out 
Nov. 12, is Thursday, although 
Carberry said she will take 
completed surveys until next 
Monday.

and five administrators ,

Student Affairs on uses for all

The 10-page survey, which 
Carberry said takes about 30 
minutes to complete, covers a 
variety of topicsJ including 
student government, academic 
support, financial aid, inter-
collegiate and recreational 
athletics and university events. 

The survey asks students to 
list how important the various 
programs and .. rvices are to 
them, and to the campus. Ualso 
asks whether the individual 
services and programs should 
be funded by the reg fee or 
whether students should pay 
extra for them.

to prepare, Carberry said.

the advisory committee s

In addition, Carberry said the 
reg fee-funded services and 
programs can learn from the 
survey how well they meet 
student needs.

OpInIon surveys . 
must be returned 
The STUDENT OPINION SURVEY was mailed out to ,l500 

randomly selected students on November 12. Tbe survey Is 
conducted by the Office of the Vice-Chancellor of Student 
Affain and the Advisory Committee on Student Fee Programs. 

It is important that all of the students who received a survey 
respond. This is an opportunity for the UCSD student body to 
give direct student input into the Vice-Cbancellor's office and 
the ACSFP allocation process. 

Since I have attended UCSD, the students' majorcomplalntis 
that they have no direct feedback on the way their fees are 
spent. I feel this Is a legitimate gripe, but DOW there is 
something students can do to enter the decision-making proceSE 
for the expenditure of their fees . • 

This is also an opportune time to tell which services you feel 
are successful and whicb you feel your money is wasted on. 

Ttie survey gives the student an outlet to voice an opinion on 
a student service or a student need. Tbis is a long awaited 
survey and one that provides a service for the UCSD student 
body. 

The deadline for the survey to be returned is December 1. 
There is still time to fill it out and return it via business reply 
mail.

Reviewer Gritiqued 
'non-existant flaws' 
To Jill Bazeley , "Arts 

Writer": 
Forgive me, a Knowledge-

able One for daring to question 
your wisdom and authority. I 
am a freshman drama major at 
this school and therefore will 
not even attempt to pretend 
that I know an awful lot about 
the theatre arts. There is one 
area in which you (and all 
"critics" for that matter) seem 
to be lacking . You very 
obviously have no conception 
whatsoever as to the enormous 
amount of work and dedication 
that goes into the production of 
a play. In fact , I would venture 
to say your personal experience 
in the theatre probably doesn 't 
go too far beyond selling tickets 

3251 Holldav Ct. at a box-office. This makes it 

From The Bridge," you create 
a non-existent flaw in the 
production and blame it on two 
inexperienced actresses. First 
of all, anyone who makes an 
idiotic statemept like " Who-
ever told actors they should 
never do nothing (beautiful 
wording, Jill) on stage should 
be shot" really shouldn't be . 
reviewing plays. You ought to 
be taking Drama 12 and 
learning something . about the 
craft before trying to critique 
someone else's skills . And 
secondly, couldn't the over-
acting you mentioned (over-
emphasized really) have been 
the director's fault as much as 
the actresses'? I mean, give us 
beginners a break . You 
mentioned nothing about the 
direction of the play, and the 
director is as much a part of the 
playas the people on stage. 
Next time look more carefully 
where you're stomping.

Breast feeding clinic 
reteaches a 'health art' 

Keleal'lllDl a healUi promo-
tion art aDd science wbich has 
been largely neglected and 
nearly forgotten for the past 50 
to 60 years is underway in an 
unusual clinic at University 
Hospital. 

The new "breast feeding 
clinic" was established in the 
hospital's Primary Care Center 
to assist any family wbo wishes 
to, or is breast feeding a baby, 
and . professionals such as 
public bealth nurses. 

Under tbe direction of 
Audrey J . Naylor, M.D., the 
clinic is staffed by a multidis-
ciplinary team of pediatric-
ians, pediatric and obstetrical 
nurse practitioners, and a 
nutritionist . Social work 
consultation also is available. 

For nearly three generations, 
Dr. Naylor said, the advant-
ages of breast feeding have 
been ignored. Many families 
have not considered it stylish 
and health professionals have 
not considered it necessary. 

Today, Dr. Naylor said, the 
many physical and psycholog-
ical advantages of breast milk 
and breast feeding are becom-
ing increasingly apparent. 
Most people now realize that 
the baby receives greater 
protection against intestinal 
infection, respiratory problems 
and allergies and that matern-
al,infant bonding is enhanced. 
More also are aware of the 
maternal advantages and the 
significantly lower cost for the 
family. Through the clinic, 
families will be aided in 
learning how to sucessfully 
breast Ceed and health profes-
sionals will learn how to teach 
and assist this process. 

The clinic, for which there is 
a minimal charge, is held each 
Wednesday Crom 1 pm to 4 pm 

The Triton Ti me. is publilhed by 
UCSD slud.nts as Ihe offici.1 Sludenl

and from 5 pm to 7 pm. Fathers 
arid bther family members are 
encouraged to attend because 
breast feeding is truly a family 
affair. Dr. Naylor said. 

Persons with questions about 
breast feediag or interested in 
learning more about the clinic 
can call the Community 
Medicine/Primary Care Office 
at 29HI48.

Leifer to censor PH? Bekken says 'unconstitutional' 
Wednesday, November 9, 

1977 the ASUCSD Council voted 
to require the ASUCSD Public 
relatlona Director to have all 
p~ Releues approved by 
the AS President prior to their 
release. Otber motions to 
require the Public Relations 
Director to clear all corres-
pondence throu,b the Presi-
dent are be~ considered. The 
council's action appllel to no 
other ASUCSD officer. Wby. bas 
this restriction been Imposed 
upon tbe Public Relations 
Director? Why did the Council 
refuse to CODlUIt tbe Public 
Relations Director before 
taking action wbich woul4 
interfere with bJs ability to 
perform his duties in tbe 
manner approved by the 
students? 

The action was taken at a 
mee'tinl of the ASUCSD Council 
held on the one day of the week 
that Jon Beklten, AS Public 
Relations Director, cali not 
attend. Other Council members 
are also unable to attend 
Wednesday meetings . Fre-
quently on Wednesday meet-
ings the Council bas problems 
reacbing, or maintaining, a 
quorum. The Council has had 
no quorum problems during the 
meetings it has held on other 
days of the week. 

Frequent crltlcJsm 
The Press Releases and 

letters sent by the Public 
Relations Director have often 
been criticized Cor their failure 
to convey a positive image of 
the ASUCSD. However, the AS 
has failed to institute programs 
or pass legislation that justifies 
a positive image. In fact, the 
actions taken by the AS to date 
have been consistent only in 
their irresponsibility. ,The AS 
has developed no programs to 
benefit the students, it has 
reached no decisions on basic 
goals, it has failed to make an 
even minimum commitment 
towards the implementation of 
student priorities as mani-
fested in the March 1977 
referendum. 

Following are thtee exam-
ples of questions wbich 
students voted overwhelmingly 
in favor of: "Silall the central 
student organization of UCSD 
work to reorganize the present 
UC Student Body Presidents' 
Council into a UC Student Union 
comprising open participation 
of all interested students , 
student organizations and 
central student organiza-
tions?", "Should the Board of 

Re,ents and UC Administra-
tion ~e reoryanlzed to be 
comprised 0 members of 
student, faculty and staff 
orlanizations.aDd to renect the 
real divenity of tbe population 
of the State of California?" , and 
"Should 'rbe Student Health 
Center offer gynecological 
services free of charge to all 
women stu'dents, including 
birth control services and all 
other women's health needs?" 
Tbere were thirty-four otber 
questions on the March 1971 
referendum alone . The AS-
UCSD bas taken action on only 
one question contained on that 
Referendum. 

Hlp AS budget 
The budgetl approved by the 

ASUCSD Council allocate sixty-
two and a balf tbousand dollars 
fo.r ASUCSD expenses alone. 
Student Organizations (includ· 
ing Campus Media and AS/Or-
ganization co-sponsored 
events) received under seven-
ty-five tbousand dollars. In 
contrast, last year the Student 
Cooperative Union spend thirty 
thousand dollars on its 
expenses and allocated a 
hundred and eight thousand 
dollars to student organiza· 
tions, including media, CPB, 
the Food Coop and Organiza· 
tions. . 

ASUCSD decisions regarding 
the Student Center Board have 
drawn criticism from many 
quarters . However, there have.' 
been AS decisions far worse 
that have failed to draw 
criticism only because students 
do not know about them . 
Luckily for the ASUCSD no 
campus media has covered AS 
activities adequately . 

Because the AS abolished the 
Communications Board as the 
first step in reorganizing that 
group, and then failed to take 
any further action, Campus 
Media have nowbere to go for 
guidance, protection or control. 
The nonexistence of a student 
controlled Communications 
Board also simplifies Adminis-
trative interference in Campus 
Media . 

Negative image 
It would be irresponsible for 

. the Public Relations Director to 
convey a positive image of the 
AS to students when reality 
does not justify such an image. 
StudentS elected a Public 
Relations Director on the basis 
of his campaign statements, 
what he said his policy would 
be, and on how be would stand 
on the issues. Stu~ents cho~ a

Public Relations J.>irectOl: who 
would tell them what the AS 
was dOirig - not what a few 
power hungry bureaucrats-in-
training would like students to 
think tbe AS is doing. ' 

In addition, Jeff Leifer, AS 
President, is the last person one 
would want to censor Press 
Releases. Jeff has a great deal 
to hide. Jeff Leifer railroaded 
the Student Center Board 
Charter through the AS 
Collllcil, during the summer, 
without consulting with the 
College Council, the Graduate 
Student Council, or tbe elected 
officers of the ASUCSD. Jeff 
Leifer rammed the Budgets 
down the Council's throat and 
then proceeded to rewrite them 
after they had been passed. J efl 
has yet to request Council 
approval for many of the 
changes he made in the budget. 

No authority 
However , the overriding 

issue is not what action the 
Council has taken, or why it has 
taken it. The fact of the matter 
is that the Council does not have 
the authority to pass, or 
enforce, bills that infringe upon 
the ability of Commissioners to 
carry out the duties of their 
offices. The Constitution of the 
ASUCSD gives the Council the 
authority to make policy 
decisions, approve apPOint-
ments , remove ASUCSD 
appointed officials, manage 
finances , sponsor student 
organizations override vetoes, 
an implement the Constitution. 
The President is given the 
authority to serve as a 
representative of the AS, 
carry out Council actions , 
submit a yearly budget , 
delegate his authority, veto 
legislation, and sit as an ex-
officio member of student 
organizations. Nowhere in the 
Constitution is the Council, or 
the President , given the 
authority to interfere in the 
activities of any ASUCSD 
Commissioner. 
, The By-Laws oC the Council, 
which the Constitution says 
"shall supplement this Consti-

tution ," also contain no 
provisions authorizing the 
Council to define the duties of 
an ASUCSD Commissioner, or 
to pass restrictions on how 
those duties shall be fulfilled . 

A Constj1ution is a document 
drawn up to define and restrict 
power. The ASUCSD has no 
power except that specifically, 
and explicitly, outlined in the 
Cons .itution. The ASUCSD can 
only take action specifically 
authorized by the Constitution 
all' , a 1I0wed by the Administra-
tion. 

Deadline past 
I. Constitutional Convention 

was requested by eighty- ix 
percent of the students voting in 
last Spring's AS elections. The 
AS Council voted unanimously 
to pursue implementation of 
the results of the March 1977 
referendum and the question on 
that AS ballot on June 7, 1977. 
The deadline for calling the 
Convention has long passed and 
yet tbe Constitutional Conven-
tion has not been called. The 
Constitution states that upon 
"passage by two-thirds (213) of 
a Council resolution to the 
effect that a Constitutional 
Convention be held, then the 
President shall schedule a 
Convention within twelve (12) 
academic days , and shall 
preside over it." According to 
the ASUCSD By-Laws " any 
officer of the ASUCSD who fails 
to perform the duties of his/ her 
office as designated by the 
Constitution ... shall be subject 
to impeachment by the Coun-
cil. " 

Impeachment . 
Articles of Impeachment are 

currently being drawn up 
against Jeff Leifer, ASUCSD 
President, for his failure to call 
a Constitutional Convention as 
mandated by the ASUCSD 
Constitution. These articles 
will be presented to the Council 
for action . 

Only through a By-Law, 
amendment or Constitutional 
Convention can the Council be 
authorized to require the Public 

Relations Director to gain 
presidenti al approval prior 
to sending out Press Releases. 
Inasmuch as it lacks the 
authority to require such action 
the Public Relations Director 
shall continue his present 
poli cy of sending Press 
Releases, whim appropriate, 
which contain brief, factual 
accounts of ASUCSD action, 
and sending a copy to Jeff 
Leifer for his files . The Public 
Rela l ions Director will not

Saxon 
criticized ... 
(conlln.eel from pale 1) 

Specifically, Pearce had 
addressed Saxon on the issue of 
the library plan that would put 
a large percenta,e of UCSD 
library books into storage 
facilities at UCLA and UCB. 
"What we want s basic library 
growth to facilitate the 
development of our pro-
grams." He said that the 
faculty does not expect to 
receive all the books it needs, as 
Saxon had implied during the 
discussion. But Pearce said 
that the bud,et would have to 
go towards sending professors 

FBI .... 
(Continueel from page I) 
in the Communist Party and/or 
front organization activities" 
of the professor. . 

The San Diego office assured 
FBI headquarters that the 
letter, which would be signed 
by "The Citizens Representing 
the Patriotic Majority," could 
not be traced. 

The FBI headquarters 
approved the letter plan, but 
said the letter's final contents 
wo uld have to be sent to 
Washington for approval. 

Stull said last week he could 
not recall ever getting a letter 
on his anti-Marcuse campaign 
from either the FBI or "The 
Citizens Representing the 
Patriotic Majority." 

"Supportive" 
" I'm sure I wouldn't have 

been against it (The FBI's 
letter plan)." Stull said. "The 
woek of the FBI in these areas 
has never bothered me and I 
have been supportive." 

When Hoover first directed 
the bureau ' s field office to 
include the " New Left" in 
COINTELPRO activities, the 
San Diego office reported little 
antiwar activity in San Diego. 

During the ten-day "inter· 
na tional student strike" in 
April , 1968, the San Diego office 
reported that San Diego area 
co llege students decided 
aga inst participation in the 
st rke because of " general 
apathy and lack of enthus-
iasm" for the movement. 

In addition, the San Diego 
office reported, students and 
other participants in antiwar 
demonstrations took "deli-
berate steps" to avoid confron-
tations with the police. 

The San Diego office also said 
area college administrators 
we re " rather permissive in 
a llowing extra freedom for 
New Left groups."

The courses utilize .outdoor 
adventure as a teaching 
medium. Independent research 
indicates that students develop 
improved self-confidence, self-
awareness and ability to work 
with others.

women and men, 16 lh and 
older. There is no upper age 
limit. Good health is necessary. 
Scholarship aid is available on

winter camping , environ-

the storage facilities to do thei r 
research, under the plan. 

From a dis&ance 
There were some professors 

who admitted that they are at a 
distance from University 
politics. Said one, who wished 
to be anonymous, "I go to the 
Acadernlc Senate meetings like 
I go to the movies." 

AS reaction was not entirely 
critical of Saxon's position. "I 
sympathize with the con· 
straints under which he is 
operating," said Fred Randel, 
professor of literature, "and I 
think he presented his situation 
to the Academic Senate well." 
However, it was clear to Randel 
that the "humanists" at UCSD 
are suffering under a scientific 
model which has been designed 
for the campus. "I thought he 
seriously underestimated the 
impact of the library plan. 
UCSD would like to have more 
resources, but on the other 
hand, we have to be aware of 
the limits under which he is 
operating. " 

A sincere guy 
"Saxon is a very sincere 

guy," said Sheldon Schultz , 
professor of physics," even if 
you don't agree with what he's 

triton times 
doing." Schultz feit aware of 
Saxon's position saying that 
there are various special 
interest groups always wanting 
"a bigger piece of the pie." It 
was his opinion, though, that 
the arguments of the UCSD 
faculty may ha ve some .ffl:ct in 
the long run. 

Schultz continued to say that 
he observed no dramatic devel-
opment during last Tuesday's 
meeting. "We more or less 
expect the type of response that 
was given," he said. 

AS Chairperson John Miles 
commented that "Everybody's 
bound to be unhappy." Among 
a wide spectrum of reactions , 
according to Miles, was a 
feeling that the issues were 
inadequately explored. "There 
are also those who feel that 
there are no simple answers to 
these probJems. " Miles 
himself saw it appropriate that' 
he remain neutral in issues 
involving the AS .

Ramones' "Rocket to Russia" 
. . 

a successful experiment 
by Mikel Toombl 

Ana Wriler 
proves to be a very wise move, 
because Roeket to Rassla 
contains 14 of the best IIODII the 
Ramones have'ever recorded. 

The Ramones' attraction to .

Tomorrow" read. Iilte a 
hopeleilly-cliched 10lt-love 
song, but Joet Ramone gives it 
hil best Forest Hills Cockney 
inflections and turns it into 
something that can be com· 

The Ramones are the world's 
greatest heavy metal pop 
group. They have taken the 
essential elements of each -
pop's melody and Iyrici.m, 
heavy metal's power and 
redundancy - and fused them 
into an impressive, unified 
sound. And if the Ramones' 
outra,eousne&I often tenda to 
obUterate the romantic qe 
inherent in pop mUlic, it makes 
them just that much more ' 
enjoyable.

pared (favorably) to the early 
works of the Beatles. 

'l'he Ramones Included a non-
original on each of their first 
two reCords, and here they go 
one better: they cover both the 
Rlvington's 1964 novelty hit 
"Surfin' Bird" (yet another 
surf song) and Bobby Free-
man's 1958 classic "Do , Vou 
Wanna Dance" (yes, that's the 
one) . " Surfin ' Bird " is 
nostalgic ' nonsense and the 
Ramones have a lot of fun doing 
it, but it's on "Do Vou Wanna 
Dance" where they really 
shine: they crank it up all the 
way and yet they don't sacrifice 
any of tbe song's considerable 
melody - it's a little scary how 
good this band 'can be. 

Finally, some mention sbould 
be made of the crazy cartoon-
like drawings on the back cover 
and on tbe innersleeve . 
drawings that seem to reflect 
the music itself. (Incidentally, 
the name of the title character 
of "Sheena Is A Punkrocker" 
was taken from the comic book 
heroine Sheena, Queen of the 
Jungle.) The Ramones have 
been criticized for having a 
"comic book mentaUty," but 
certainly pop music must by 
necessity adqpt the slmpUcity 
of the comics - the Ramones 
are just more blatant and 

. honest about it. The Ramones 
are .responsible for producing 
some of the most inspired and 
hilarious pop music around 
today, ' and never have they 
done it better than on Roekd &0

Students achieve "professional" quality 
Stunning performances in "Slag" 

by Jill Louise Bueley 
AnI Writer 

It is a shame that the UC 
drama department graduate 
productions are often over-
looked by a great majority of 
thea tre goers; they are 
gene rally interesting, many 
times daring , and in some 
cases, of excellent quality. 

"Slag," written by David 
Hare and directed by second 
year graduate student Jennifer . 
Parent is one of these cases 
where excellence passed by the 
public unnoticed . Had it been 
per formed in the UCSD 
Theatre it might have attracted 
the attention it deserved, but 
unfortunately it was relegated 
to the small room of MC 409, a 
rabbit hutch of a place, where 
most of the seating was on the 
floor. (Could anything be worse 
than the Mandeville Recital 
Hall? Yes.) . 

The three performers in 
"Slag" are also second year 
graduate students and they 
adeptly proved that the drama 
department's MFA program 
really does train actors to be of 
professional quaUty. In fact, 
one would be lucky to encounter 
such skillful dramatic perform-
ances anywhere in San Diego. 

Santa Dilavore was magnifi-
cent as the obscene, revolution-
ary Joanne, one of three 
teachers at Brockburst, an 
English girl's boarding school 

where the ation of "Slag" takes 
place. Dilavore 's flexibility 
carried the character of Joanne 
far deeper than her motto 
suggests - "' intercourse or 
isolation. I choose isolation." 

Similarly, Robyn Hunt , 
playing Ann, a frumpy , 
masculine gym teacher, and 
Valerie Shanks as the sexy 
Elise ('" am a lKIrmal sort of 
woman") gave stunningly 
intense performances. 

"Slag," though it has 
resonances of Hellman 's "The 
Children's Hour," is more like 
Lawrence taken to the nth, or 
absurd, schizophrenic power. 
The title suggests the Lawrenc· 
ian connection even further. 

After all that coal mining what 
are we lert with ? - Slag . 
Indeed, "Slag" does a lot of the 
same searching after just the 
right sexuality that a Lawrence 
novel or story does, but it is not 
in the same vein-itls notatall 
as serious. Joanne sums it up by 
saying, " women have got to be 
strong - and lighthearted." 

"Slag's" new exploration of 
feminism and female relation-
ships, the three fine actresses, 
Dilavore, Hunt and Shanks, 
along with Parent's cleverly 
st-udied direction all came 

. together beautifully into the 
somewhat abstrct form of an 
entirely enjoyable evening of 
semi-surrealistic theatre.

During the past several years the simple "PH Story" has been told over 
and over . Besides preserving nature's Acid Mantle of 4.5-5.5 ph, 
shampoo must contain NUCLEOPROTEINS DNA and RNA. These 
essential building blocks in the polypeptide chain repair damaged protein 
in the same ratio from which it is naturally depleted from the hair!! A full 
complement of amino acids, vitamins, minerals, enzymes and coen-
zymes hydrolized to' the correct size and weight penetrate the hair shaft 
and are utilized by the NUCLEOPROTEINS to reconstruct hair damage. 
Deficient moisture must be replaced yet excessive moisture must be 
repelled in maintaining proper protective balance.
