UCSD Student 
Appoi nted to 
State Board 

A UCSO student has finally 
made his voice heard in 
Sacramento. . 

Alan Kremen, a senior in 
political Science, was recently 
appointed by Gov. Brown to the 
State Board of Examiners of 
Nursing Home Administrators. 
The Board, a branch of t:he State 
Department of Consumer 
Affairs, is responsible for 
licensing nursing home ad-
ministrators and investigating 
and revoking licenses of 
unqualified administrators. 

Kremen's appointment to the 
Board came about through his 
concern for quality of nursing 
homes and his active in-
volvement in the California 
Public Interest Research Group 
(CaIPIRG). 

CaIPIRG investigated nursing 
homes in the San Oiego area 
which led to his writing the 
research paper "Would you call 
this Home?" 

Also supporting Kremen's 
appointment was the recent 
passage of the Senate bill SB 2116 
which requires the majority of 
members on state boards to be 
public members, or people not 
involved in the professional 
fields . Brown is attempting to 
make the appointments to the 
state boards more effective by 
allowing laymen to be involved in 
greater numbers. The State 
Board of Examiners of Nursing 
Home Administrators needed 
more public members, and 
Kremen was chosen as one. 

Power of Board 
Kremen stated that "I feel the 

Board has a lot of power in ef-
fecting the quality of nursing 
homes." The Board is respon-
sible for granting licenses to 
nursing home administrators and 
setting the criteria for a qualified 
administrator. The Board also 
gathers complaints about in-

Alan Kremen 
competent administrators and 
carries t:hrough with an in-
vestigation, often revoking 
licenses. 

According to Kremen 
"revoking licenses of an in-
competent administrator-poses to 
be one of t:he biggest problems for 
the board." The Board often pays 
for costly investigations and 
courtroom fees, making 
adequate funding a problem. 
Currently, the Board is appealing 
to the legislature for additional 
funds. 

K"remen will continue in-
vestigating ' nursing homes 
t:hrough CalPffiG, serving as 
chairperson for its Regional 
Board of Directors. Next quarter 
Kremen hopes to do a study with 
CalPIRG concerning the en-
forcement of Law AB 1600, which 
gives the State Health Depart-
ment the power to fine nursing 
homes. A political science major, 
Kremen hopes to become a 
lawyer and to continue studying 
nursing homes and legal 
processes. 

As the youngest apointee on the 
state board, Kremen felt "It will 
be an interesting challenge for a 
student to be a member ." 
Kremen urged further student 
involvement in supporting the 
rights of the elderly in nursing 
homes. "It is time for young 
people to consider the problems 
of the elderly and health care in 
general. My appointment 
signifies that young people can be 
a viable part of the political 
process and can offer criticism 
for our society."

AIm ~ Nuclear QJntracts 
Regents Relinquish Tenure Veto 

by Mark Stadler 
Managing Editor 

The Board of Regents voted last 
Friday to relinquish its power of 
final review in faculty tenure 
decisions. 

The regents were given a 
detailed account of UC's tenure 
process, wit:h Saxon presenting an 
IS-page report and David Wilson, a 
former faculty representative to 
the board, showing a 2O-minute 
slide show. 

In a split vote, the Regents Both men defended UC's tenure

The UC tenure process is "not a 

process of blame but of judgement 
on academic research," Saxon 
said. 

What is Excellence? 
Brown also questioned t:he use of 

the term " excellence" in tenure 
proceedings, saying it has a sub-
jective definition. 

"The concept of excellence, 
while it sounds clear, may not be. 
Maybe it is clearly defined in 
physics , but in political science or 
sociology, maybe in a whole 
spectrum of fields , excellence is 
subjective," Brown said.

The regents' decision to extend 

UC affiliation with the con-
troversial weapons laboratories 
was near-unanimous, with only 
Willens and Peeples voting against 
the renewal.

Crime Prevention ·Program 
launched by UCSD Police 

by M-C Brien 
Staff Writer 

The UCSO Campus Police have launched a crime prevention program 
aimed at lowering the campus crime rate, which, t:hough down from last 
year, is still high. 

" The only way we're going to stop crime is to educate people," said 
Officer Steve Branen, who went through a two week POST (Peace 
Officer's Standards and Training) course in Pomona, and is now cer-
tified to teach crime prevention. 

He will relay what he learned to the other 19 officers, and is "con-
sidering the possibility of initiating an educational program which 
would make new staff and students aware of crime prevention. We have 
just purchas d a slide show for this purpose," he added. 

" Before a crime can occur, the criminal must not only have the 
desire, but the opportunity. If we can slow the attack time," Branen 
explained, " we will reduce the criminal's opportunity to perpetrate, and 
in the long run, the number of crimes will lower significantly." 

Bicycle 1beft Problem 
Bicycle theft is one of the PO's largest problems. "Getting into the 

mcchanics of the locks Is necessary to stop bike theft," Branen ex-
plained. " In our station, we have a display of locks which we found hard 
to pick. We suggest that students look them over and choose one that 
meets their needs. We'll be glad to give them any information we have 
on the locks. We're seeing that some of these are made available at the 
Bike Coop," he added. 

"The locks most easily attacked are those constructed of light alloy, 
and those with shackles secured on one side only. Some bike thieves 
carry bolts around th ir n ks. Th y stoop down as if they own the bike 
and are abol,lt to unlock it, but they quickly snap the lock open and then 
ride off. It's hard to tell they're 8t allng them. Also, som bicycle cables 
ca n be cut strand by trand with toenail clippers."

While the Supreme Court agreed 
to hear a rguments in the case, it is 
not known when it will make its 
decision . UC Prcsident Saxon, in a 
statemcnt ycsterday, sa id the 
court will probably begin hea ring 
the case in October.

Soviet Scientist Calls for Cooperation 
by Joel C. DOD 

Associate News Editor 

A Soviet scientist , Alexander Petrovich Pekhov, 
working in genetic engineering research , expressed 
his country's concern for " international cooperation" 
here last Thursday in the new scientific frontier of 
recombinant DNA research. 

Pekhov, here as part of a special science exchange 
program, wiJI visit half a dozen research institutions 
during his 13 day visit in the US. A professor at the 
Patrice Lumumba People's Friendship Univer ity in 
Moscow, Pekhov's first visit in this country was with 
Donald Helinski, Project Director of DNA r search 
forUCSD. 

Noting that Soviet investigators are intere t d in 
fomling conta ts with Am rican scientists involved 
in DNA res arch , Pekhov said that the Soviet Union is 
" studying" the con rn in the US for r gulation of 
what some cientists believ to be a pot ntiall 
dangerous type of research to mankind. 

A current concern am ng om cientists in th US 
is the potential for unpredictable hazards in th 
rcsear h. When ask d about the controv rsy in th 
Ameri an sdcntifi ommunity and wh th('r Sovict 
scientist:; ar awar \ of it, Pcl.hov said . ' Wl' aI'\! 
{ollowing the i sue here in th United tatc ." 

peaking through an interpreter, Pekhov outltned 
the Sov iet regulation of all potentially hazardous 
scientific research, noting that "We approach the 
problem from another angle ." He also sta ted that " In 
our country aU research has ocia l a nd state control, 
the I' fore our scientists a re not too concerned that the 
re ults are going to be used in the harm of mankind." 

Although gen t ic engine r ing or recombinant DNA 
re ea rch in the URis only in the beginning stages, 
Pekhov . aid Sovi t cientists are interested in gene 
expr ssion, systems of genetic recombination in 
bact ria a nd th potential clin ical benefits to society. 
His pa rticula r pe ialty, as a re ea rcher in a medical 
school , is in th stUdy of th genetic origin and syn-
th i. of antig ns. 

Ask d whether s ientists in the Soviet Union 
consider recombinant DNA resea rch more dangerous 
than other type f bi ) 10 Ica l research, Pekhov in-
sisted that " th control prin iple ' a Ingle prin-

My principle from the start has 
been open participation for all 
students in student government. [

concerns. I am fully prepared to 
answer aU charges brought against 
me. As always, I am pleased to 
answer aU questions, furnish any 
documents requested and open aU 
my activities to your scrutiny. 

A hearing will be held by the

Support Group to detennine the 
validity of the charges. During the 
Coop meeting of February 14, 

Mark Fingennan stated that the 
members of this support group 
are: Rebecca Hayden, Kevin 
CahiU, Sheri O'Laverty, Ken 
Duclow and Mark Fingerman. 

The charges ~ught against me 
refer to grievances which occurred 
during the winter quarter 1977. 
During this quarter, Rebecca, 
Sheri and Ken attended very few 
meetings. During the last week 
Mark and I have had a serious

"Fears have lome basis" 
"The fears of scientists have 

some basis to them," Pekhov said, 
adding that "if these experiments 
arc truly dangerous, you have to 
create conditions in which they can 
be conducted." Pekhov, however, 
noted that the Soviet Union has not 
considered special facilities for 
their work in recombinant DNA 
research. 
" My personal opinion," he 

continued, " is that this is a 
tr emendous achievement in 
science and it seems that all the 
questions that are stimulated by 

this research work will be resolved 
by very strict control, from both 
society and government."

Saxon however, maintained his

While the decision drew li~t1e 
opposition within the board, the tJC

years between 1971 and 1976, releva nt knowledge students 
spokeswoman at the have picked up during their 
University of New York's outside of school. Though the 
State College, a special rience credits have been 
continuing education for by some of the more 
students, says that there professors on college 
"steady stream of a spokeswoman at the 
coming in." College says that 

learning must be 
SUNY, which is trying to and that credit is given 

the fiscal perils of empty for "learning." As an example, 
due to diminishing not es that someone who has

"learning centers" are that accoWlting or some

She says that the studentll, who have 
an average age of 37, are interested 
in various fields . 

"Some years, everybody's on a 
social science kick, the next year 
they're on an accounting kick, " she 
observes. 

The program was set up, she says, 
because " there was a demand." 

Cleon F . Thompson, vice-
president of Student Affairs for the 
University of North Carolina, thinks 
that more old-timers are showing up 
on his sytem's 11 campuses because, 
1) they are living longer and, 2) 
older people are seeking to iJ'nprove. 
their skills and knowledge so that 
they can perform better at their jobs 
and benefit more from their 'leisure 
hours. Several UNC campuses, he 
says, actively are seeking older 
students, and the long-range plan at 
UNC is to attract a larger number of 
the old as the young become 
relatively scarce. Week-i!nd colleges 
offered by the University provide 
older scholars a chance to brush up 
on agricultural techniques as wcll as 
in areas of the liberal arts, but offer 
no credit. 

Though UC Berkeley docs not 
have special programs for aging 
coll cgians, Dr. Fern French of the 

Berkeley School of Public Health 
notes that " we are not allowed to 
di. criminate on the basis of age. 
Grandparents are getting degrees." 
The oldest student at UC Berkeley is 
75. 

Onc spokesman for the American 
Association of State Colleges and 
Universities thinks that colleges 
soon will operate at three levels so 
that they can meet the diverse needs 
of traditional youthful students, of 
middle-aged workers , and of 
retirees . 

Indeed, the development of con-
tinuing adult education may be 
encouraging family unity and more 
exchanges between members of 
separate generations. 

" My daughter has homework 
almost cvery night and wc more or 

Ic~s do ours together," says Mary 
Seeman, a 37-year-old student 
majoring in interior design at 
Orcgon State University in Cor-
vallis. Fifty-one year-old John 
Kuscr, a former professor who is 
carning a doctorate in f restry at 
OSU, SHYS he has no trouble finding 
young partners for his doubles 
tennis cngagemcnts.

UCSD Crushed By Mira Costa JC 
by Judy Walton 

Staff Writer 

It was not a game to be 
remembered for UCSO's women's 
basketball team last Friday. What 
else can you say about a 100-38 
loss'? 

anyway. " At the last game, 
against Grossmont Junior College 
(which was ranked in the top three 
teams along with Mira Costa last 
year), UCSD fared much better, 
losing by only one point, 52-53. 

According to the coach, Judy 
Malone, " they (Mira Costa) 
certainly were a powerhouse. After 
we got over our initial frustration 
and anger, I think we did as well as 
could be expected. I 'm sure that 

TTn 

next time we'll handle them a little 
bit better." All the girls," con-
tinued Malone, " have been doing 
really well in picking up the new 
teclmiques a nd strategies. I'm 
especially pleased with their en-
thusiasm and spirit. Basketball is 
mostly a mental sport ... if you can 
relax and think during a game 
without letting your frustration get 
to you, then you're that much 
ahead of yourself. "

Mira Costa Junior College, 
Wldefeated in both league and non-
league play, entered the UCSO 
gym and proceeded to walk over 
the Tritons. It was obvioUl!l from 
the start that Mira Costa was going 
to dominate the game. With seven 
minutes to go in the first half, the 
score was already 1().36. 

A BARGAiN AT ANY PRicE 
The Tritons, according to 

players Mary Jo Speer and Laura 
Greenberg, played "as well as we 
could," though Greenberg felt, 
" the offeMe could have been a bit 
better." However, according tp 
Greenberg, " there's no way Mira 
Costa woo't be number one in the 
league. They've just got an ex-
cellen team, that 's all."

. 

The leading scorers for the 
Tritons were Carol Hawley and 
Dani Grady, each with eight 
points. Mira Costa had a very tall 
team, which made scoring -even 
more difficult for UCSD. MC's box-
and-one defense was also hard to 
penetrate. The Tritons ran a 2-1-2 
zone' defense , which worked 
adequately. 

....- U C San lIega campus Program Board presents 

After half-time. with the -score 
standing at 17-50, UCSO attempted 
to hold the point-spread constant, 
but with little success. , 

Despite the one-sided loss 
Greenberg said, " We weren't down 
in spirits at all, and we played our 
best t ill the end ... 

Speer emphasized that there 
were "a few players with injuries, 
at least three , who played

ECONOMics 1 B will be repeated Spring 
Quarter. Students currently taking 1 A who did nOl 
take 1 B in the Fall can complete the Economics 1 
sequence this Spring by taking both 1 Band 1 C 
simultaneously . Although 1 C normally require 1 B 
as prerequisite, taking the two courses 
simultaneously will be sufficient this t ime only . 
(1 A remains a prerequisite to 1 C , however.) The 
instructor for 1 B will be Professor Ramanathan, 
and the I ctures will meet Tuesday and Thursday , 
9 :30 - 10:50a .m . 

ECONOMics 4 A new course entitled 1 
"Introduction to Management & Accounting", Will • 
also be offored in the Spring . This course will treat .: 
the concept of management and its func tions , . 
with emphasis given to accounting as the basic : 
information system of organ izations . Topics t.o be ~ 
covered include : marketing, production, finance, 
haslc accounting concepts. and the construction • 
and analysis of the two fundamental financial ~ 
statements , the Profit ·and Loss Statement, and • 
the Balonce Sheet. ~ 

Economics 4 has become a lower d ivision 
prerequisite for the management science major, 
but it is not a prerequisite for the economics 
major. 

~ 
i 
, 

BP.ginning next ye r , Economics 4 will become _ 
a prerequiste for the upper diVision accounting 
course. Economics 173. Thus, students intending 
to take 173 in the Sprtng Quarter of 1978 should 
tilke Economics 4 thi comin !~ quarter . 

Taking Economics 4 d es not earn credit 
toward Ihe upper diviSion requirements of either 
the economics or management sci nce majors . 

Ther is some talk of est b)ishlng a business 
minor for Third ond Fourth Colle tudent . 
The outcome of th e UIS u ston IS unc rt In, at

Economtrs 4 would almost certainly a reqUlr d
