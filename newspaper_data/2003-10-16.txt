$ I billion campaign

"Imagine What's Next" has

launchlOg, U SD's $1 billion 
fundral ing campaign, "Imagine

~?09.2 lrulli?n in &'Ifts and pledges. 
J he campaign was first publicly 
II1troduced in March 2003 and is 
scheduled to conciude JlLOe 2007. 

T he campaign began its 
"quiet phase" in July 2000, when 
the univer ity fir t introduced the 
Idea to the private sector to find 
out whether or not the project 
would be plausible. 

Now in the public pha e, the 
campaign i halfway to the SI bil -
lion goal. 

"When you think about the 
basic equation of rapid growth and 
declining tate resour es, I'd ay 
we'd have to explore other areas of 
funding," Vice Chancellor of 
External Relations Jame E. 
Langley aid. "We believed it was 
important to turn to the private 
ector." 

A cording to Langley, U D 
is one out of 40 universities that 
has attempted to rai e S I biUion. 

"This was a tall order for 
U SD," Langley aid. "There 
was a degree of risk and our 
donors have responded in a way 
that we find very rewarding." 

The university has 
approached different potential 
donors in the private sector, 
including parents, corporations 
and businesses. Donations 
include the Irwin and Joan 
Jacobs' donation of SilO million 
to the Jacobs School of 
Engineering and a S20 million 
gift by UC Board of Regents

Rebecca going toward the

WiUiam Stensrud, chief executive 
officer of Ensemble Inc., and his 
wife Carol also recently gave a S5 
million gift for the School of 
Management. 

The donations received from 
the campaign wi ll go to areas such 
a academic programs, endowed 
chairs and scholarships.

Week highlights 
Islamic awareness 
MSA organizes a series 
of events and lectures 

By SOFIA MARIN 
Contributing Writer 

The Muslim Student 
Association is holding Islam 
Awareness Week, which began on 
Oct. 13 and is scheduled to con-
clude on Oct. 17. Throughout 
the week, the MSA has sponsored 
several different events encourag-
ing student consciousness of the 
Islamic religion. 

On the afternoon of Oct. 13, 
tables were set up on Library 
Walk with information on the 
religion. In an attempt to educate 
the UCSD community of the 
fuhdamental values and teachings 
of Islam, the tables provided 
information about several Islamic 
practices. 

"This week is about bringing 
Islamic awareness to UCSD 
students and to erase miscon-
ceptions that people may have," 
Revelle College senior and 
MSA member Nivin Qudeimat 
aid. 

The MSA also scheduled a 
series of lectures in hopes of 
teaching others more about the 
religion and clarifying any false 
impressions students might 
have. 

To commence the lecture 
series, Sheikh Yas er Fazaga 
spoke on Oct. 14 at Center Hall 

in a lecture titled "Discover 
Islam." The speaker gave a con-
cise overview of Islam, high-
lighting key concepts and prac-
tices which typically receive lit-
tle representation, according to 
Fazaga. 

"The way Americans know 
about Islam has always been 
through news headlines," Fazaga 
said. 

According to Fazaga, the 
media has a tendency to cover 
stories about Islam only when it 
is associated with negative or 
sensational events, and he said 
much of the public's misconcep-
tions about Islam stem from the 
inadequate frames of coverage 
most commonly employed by 
news media. 

"[There exi ts] a misconcep-
tion that all Arabs are Muslims or 
that all Muslims are Arab," 
Fazaga said. 

Fazaga cited statistics, saying 
that approximately 1.3 billion 
people in the world are Mu lim, 
or every one in every five people. 
He also said that contrary to pop-
ular thought, Asia and Africa are 
home to the majority of Mu lim 
people. _ 

He also rebutted the idea 
that most American Muslims are

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 16, 2003 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Awareness: 
Lecture 

discusses 
Islamic faith 

Bill could protect 
student privacy 

conrinutd from page r 

Act would allow students 
to sue over info release 

foreign immigrants; on the con-
trary, 60 percent of American 
Muslims are actually natural born 
citizcns, 

Fagaza also discussed the term 
"jihad," which has frequently been 
defined as a "holy war. " 

According to Fazaga, this term 
has not received fair representa-
tion . 1.le said that jihad is a moral 
obligation of Muslims to rid the 
world of oppression and can also 
be a truggle against evil within 
oneself. A holy war against 
oppression is just one aspect of 
jihad, he said. 

Islam literally means "submis-
sion [to God]," or it can mean 
"peace through submitting to the 
will of God," Fagaza aid. The 
Qur'an, as well as the Torah and 
the New Testament of the Bible, 
are also used in Islam. 

Fazaga went on to explain 
Islam' Pillars of Faith, which 
include a belief in all the prophets, 
This includes prophets from the 
Hebrew Bible (the Torah), as well 
as prophets from the Christian 
New Testament. 

Jesus, Mary, Moses and 
Muhammad, among others, are all 
believed to be prophets of God in 
Islam. 

Fa zaga also explained that 
Islam, in comparison to 
Christianity, also holds the belief 
that J esus existed; however, it 
holds that he is not the son of God 
and did not die for humani ty'S 
sins.

Contributing Writer 

A new bill, the Educational 
Rights and Privacy Act, that is 
being explored by Congress may 
soon give parents and eligible sru-
dents a new tool for legal action 
against schools that have released 
their personal information with-
out prior written consent. The bill 
modifies the Family Educational 
Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, 
which forbids schools from releas-
ing srudent records without prior 
consent but does not permit the 
student to take legal proceedings 
against their school. 

"The remedy for students who 
feel their records were released in 
violation of FERPA is to first 
notify their school and allow the 
administration to assess the com-
plaint and correct the deficiency," 
Director of Student Policies and 
Judicial Affairs Nicholas Aguilar 
said. "If [the student) is still 
unsatisfied, [they] can take their 
case to the U.S. Deparunent of 
Education. However, he or she 
may not sue them." 

Rep. Robert Andrews (D-N.] .) 
proposed the bill in April in 
response to an incident in 

pokane, Wash, The U.S. 
Supreme Court ruled in favor of 
the univer i ty that had been sued 
by a former student, who believed 
he lost an employment opportuni-
ty when his university released his 
personal records, according to a 

St.te C •• p .... tI •• In • .,.lcl fund 

report by the Badgrr Hrrald. 
"FERPA needs to be modified 

because the current law has no 
teeth," Andrews told the Herald. 
"Currently, a student's only rem-
edy is to file a grievance, which 
mayor may not sanction the uni-
versity. The school is not held 
accountable for their action." 

According to Section 160-2 of 
the UCSD Policy and Procedures 
Manual, "personally identifiable 
information from student records 
may not be disclosed without the 
prior written consent of the stu-
dent." 

FERPA has protected the 
rights of students at Columbia 
University when the Recording 
Industry Association of America 
sent subpoenas to numerous col-
leges requesting infonnation on 
certain students that had been 
sharing copyrighted downloaded 
music files. Colwnbia University 
nullified the requests, stating that 
releasing the records would be a 
violation of FERPA. 

If passed by Congress, the bill 
would expedite procedures taken 
by the student or parent filing the 
coraplaint against their school, 
giving them the authority to take 
legal proceedings instead of hav-
ing to first take their case to the 
administration, and then to the 
U.S. Department of Education,

Moores ana draws attention 
to a significant number of 
2002 UC Berkeley aptJlicants 
admitted to the uruversity 
despite having SAT I scores 
below 1,000. 

The analysis, co-
authored by Moores, claims 
that the several hundred 
students admitted with dras-
tically subaverage scores 
were "marginally academi-
cally qualified," while nearly 
one-third of all applicants 
with SAT I scores over 
1,500 were turned away. 

Critics of the University 
of California's "comprehen-
sive review," the admissions 
process the university has 
utilized for the past two 
incoming classes, contend 
that it is a gross injustice 

when an applicant scoring 
so high on a test designed to 
measure scholastic aptitude 
iStushed aside for a student 
o much lower scores 
because of an admissions 
officer's subjective views on 
hardships and extra-curricu-
lar talents. 

Comprehensive review 
recognizes that an individ-
ual's achievement is not 
always measured in test 
scores, but also in the obsta-
cles one has overcome or by 
excelling in areas such as 
leadership, arts or athletics. 

Unfortunately, no quanti-
tative system for measuring 
these so-called intangibles 
has yet been disclosed to the 
public, nor have the details 
of the u.rUversity's compre-
hensive review process. 

t\Pplicants must be able to 
quality for admission by 
meeting UC parameters set 
forth in the grades-scores eli-
gibility index, but we must 
also consider an individual's 
achievements elsewhere to 
achieve fairness. 

Student liberty must be 
protected at all levels 

T he administration is tightening the noose 
and going for the 

jugular. Nick Aguilar, direc-
tor of Student 'Policies and 
Judicial Affairs, has targeted 
for elimination a student's 
right to have nonattorney 
advocates at disciplinary 
hearings. Aguilar's reason-
ing for eilminating this 
important right is flawed . 
He claims that advocates 
were "raising the level of the 
hearing process ... to [a] 
much more formal and 
legalistic environment." 

In a formal academic 
misconduct hearing, where 
students' educational 
futures are at stake, it is 
crucial that they be allowed 
someone to represent them. 
In many cases, students in 
hearings face off against 
veterans of the student judi-
cial system - such as resi-
dent deans or resident ecu-
rity officers - or even pro-
fes ors and faculty with law 
degrees. If students are 

being prosecuted by a 
lawyer, It stands to reason 
that they should be defend-
ed by one as well. 

Aguilar's policy would 
force srudents to repre ent 
themselves and speak on 
their own behalf. hy sru-
dents would suffer if they 
were forced to peak in front 
of a judicial board . Students 
for whom English is their 
second language may find it 
difficult to convince an 
English-speaking judicial 
board of their innocence if 
they cannot adequately 
speak the language. 

Aguilar's recommenda-
tion is not only bad policy, 
but also discriminatory. 
Eliminating advocates does 
not serve the students, but it 
does serve administrators 
seeking to limit student lib-
erty li6erties. For the sake of 
the students, the conduct 
code must not be changed 
and students must continue 
to nave the right to repre-
sentation.

~ I LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Shuttle needed, not 

A.S: fault 
Editor: 

I am writing this letter in 
response to recent news coverage 
of the cancellation of Triton Taxi 
service from the US-Mexico bor-
der. Let me first thank the 
Guardilln for commenting on the 
cancellation. I first read about the 
cancella tion in a one-sentence 
blurb in the A.S. At-A-Glance 
section, and was disappointed that 
such a potentially useful service 
was allowed to terminate with so 
little public objection. 

The Guordum's editorial on the 
subject not only helps to eduane 
the UCSD public about the change 
in service, but al a goes a long way 
toward building public support for 
Its re-establishment. Two years 
ago, in the months before I found-
ed the "Triton Taxi from 1]" pro-
gram, the Guardum published an 
editorial endorsing my proposal . 
Not only did that give me encour-
agement and affirtTl2tion. but it also 
provided me with an effective bat 
to swing at a skeptical administra-
tion and a cash-strapped A.S. 
Council. 'That's just the sort of 
responsible activism we should 
expect from a campus newspaper. 

However, I do not believe that 
we should admonish 
Commi sioner of Student 
Services Kelly Vasant for signing a 
contract that preserves the origi -
nal, and most heavily used, parts 
of the popular Triton Taxi pro-
gram. Instead , we hould provide 
encouragement and funding for a

somehow eliminate the

resumption in border ervice. 
Cloud 9 Shuttles provides afe 

Ride service to UCSD and DSU 
at a cost thar is dramatically lower 

than they charge to their private 
and corporate customers. Cloud 9 
has also proven to be tIexible and 
reliable in accommodating sru-
dents, and has generated far (ewer 
complaints than the TritOn Taxi's 
previous contractor. If A.S. is to 
change their contractor, they will 
have a difficult time finding a new 
provider with such high levels of 
service. 

Cloud 9 may well be the best 
and only company in San Diego 
able to meet the needs of the 
Triton Taxi program. Further 
negotiations wi th them should 
therefore be encouraged. I f Cloud 
9 is unable or unwilling to resume 
border service, a separate and 
addi tional contractor might be 
enlisted, instead of abandoning 
Cloud 9 altogether. 

Whenever there is a change in 
the Tnton Taxi service provider, 
the thousand of Triton Taxi stick-
ers already issued are voided. 
requiring each and every student to 
sign a new waiver and receive a new 
sticker. This enormous process is 
not only administratively difficult 
and costly, but also creates an 
unwanted barrier to student safety. 

If readers want to help 
Commissioner Vasant resume safe 
rides from the border, e-mail her 
so she can show the A.S. Council 
and the admini tration just how 
much you care:

Baseball, Arnold, deadbeat Deanheads frustrate the ravin' 
Candidate backs out of presidential election, N.s blow it again 

Quoth the 
ravin' 
Evan McLaughlin 

I 've usually been a critic of Tuesdays. Classes drag on for 80 minutes at a time. By 
Tue day, the excitement of the last 
weekend has run its course and the 
four days before the next drag on 
like a Susan Sarandon movie 
marathon. As I came to learn dur-
ing my dining hall days, the worst 
meals Canyon Vista served were, 
like clockwork, on Tucsdays. 

obody likes Tuesdays. 
Enter Oct. 7, 2003. It was 

roughly 10 a.m. when I awoke, and 
on top of it being a Tuesday, my 
spirits were already treading water 
in a Tijuana gutter. My beloved 
Oakland A's had choked yet again in 
the Major League Baseball play-
offs, and I had spent the remainder 
of the preceding night playing vir-
rual manager with my fellow to.' 
fans whi Ie drinlci ng more cheap rcd 
wille than the Pai anos in 
Steinbeck's "Tortilla Flat." 

Few things demoralize avid 
sports fans more than when their 
team lose in the playoffs. When 
"friends" bring up these losses, you 
fcellikc they're really saying, "J ley, 1 
heard about your dream girl dump-
ing you - thats to bad." I laving 
these idiots rub it in is like having 
them say that they're the one she's 
bedding With no\ . The moral of the 
;tory: Be careful about what you say 
during the playoff, because the 
response may be a left hook. 

nut I decided to worry about my 
next opponent that morning -
Total Recall. I threw on some shoes 
and was wallcing toward my local 
polling place when I felt "it." Yes, 
"it" being the 3.6 magnitude earth-
quake that hit a local fault that 
morning. I don't know exactly what 
spurned it upon us. Perhaps it was 
symbolic of how the people were 
giving Sacramento the 01' shake-
down and jostling the corruption 
free from the state capitol by hold-
ing this election. 

Or maybe it was a warning shot 
from the higher-ups (you know, God 
and sruff), proclaiming that fire and 
brimstone would follow shortly 
thereafter if we continued to play 
around with our democracy by buy-
ing signatures to hold a high school 
popularity contest where Mr. 
Universe goes against a guy whose 
personality is the only thing less col-
orful than his name. Either way, the 
natural order had been disrurbed, for 
bener or worse. After all, how else 
could the Red Sox have advanced? 

But for chronology'S sake, I will 
save the ravin' about Total Recall for 
later. An equally disrurbing event for 
this Democrat was to see my horse 
for the presidential nomination, en. 
Bob Graham (D-Fla.), withdraw his 
bid before the fim primary. Yes, I 
realize that in the poll he wa only a 
few pegs above arol Mosley Braun, 
Rev. AI harpton, and everybody's 
favorite oddball, Rep. Dennis 
Kucinich (D-Ohio). But we're ruling 
out the old Democrat way: that the 
nominee is always a dark horse. 

Rewind history 12 years, if you 
will, and take a look at who stood at 
IX percent in the Gallup polls in 

Ocr. 199 1 - 13 months before he 
would unseat an incumbent. Bill 

Clinton is correct. Similar stories, 
for one reason or another, can be 
made for Democratic candidates 
Jimmy Carter, John F. Kerunedy, 
Michael Dukalcis and George 
McGovern. Sure the latter two got 
their asses kicked, but they were 
nominated nonetheless while being 
smashed in the early polls, much like 
Graham was. 

But what wa so appealing about 
Graham anyway? Why haven't I 
jumped on the Il oward Dean 
bandwagon, a cult comprised of 
hipsters and PR liberals that 
rivals the Jonestowns of Friendster, 
the Boy Scouts and every high 
school band combined? I Ie is run-
ning an awesome campaign that 
appeals to the wannabe activists in 
colleges and has used the Internet 
better than anyone else in this race 
to garner cash and support. 

It 's mainly because Howard 
Dean is from Vermont, and I 
haven't come to respect that yet. 
He did all of these grea t things for 
Vermont - balanced the budget, 
worked to provide 92 percent of 
the state's adults with health care, 
improved the state' schools. But 
come on, it' Vermont, a state as 
white as a John Hughes movie (97 
percent) and with a populaoon half 
the size of an Diego. 

Graham, on the other hand, bal-
anced eight consecutive budgets as 
governor of Florida, a state with the 
complexities of a diver e population 
- urban and rural, hayseeds and 
immigrants - while being tile very 
definition of a swing state, as the 
2000 election can prove. Aloof note 
is that Florida is in the outh, the 
region that every successful 
Democratic candidate has hailed 
from since Kerunedy.

But even so, Americans have to 
realize that this election has already 
been split into two issues by the 
media - national security in the 
post-9111 world and the economy 
- and that if the Oems are going to 
heave a polar opposite of Bush onto 
its stage, he better be armed to the 
teeth. Graham has served as chair of 
the Senate Intelligence Committee 
and has been a vocal opponent of 
the president's handling of Iraq from 
the get go. In July, Graham and 
other colleagues finished the report 
on 911 1 while he questioned why 
Bush should be be impeached to 
investigate whether or not he misled 
us about uranium or the reasons to 
go to war. Hell, we impeached 
Clinton for dropping his drawers. 
As a bumper sticker I recently saw 
exclaimed, "When Clinton lied, 
nobody died ." 

Graham wasn't afraid to say the 
same and wasn't given due credit 
when the logic is clear and JUSt. 

As for the economy, once again 
I don't see how balanci ng a budget 
in Vermont can hold a candle to 
balancing it eight consecutive times 
in 1980s Florida. Graham opposed 
every step of the irrespon ible Bush 
tax cuts and the Republicans' 
attempts to destroy Medicare in the 
latest prescription drug bill (which 
Dean publicly supports) among 
other things. In the end, he didn't 
have enough money to keep up 
with the big dogs. I just hope he's 
around in ovember 2004 as a run-
ning mate because it would be a 
shame to see such an electable can-
didate go to waste for the Oem. 

So yes, the milk has been spilled 
and I'm not quite ready to sip on 
the Dean Kool-aid JUSt yet 
(although Karl Rove t smugly hop-

ing that I and every other 
Democrat do so, as he is quoted as 
saying in the July 5 issue of the 
Washington Port). And for the 
record, Wesley Clark is the 
Arnoldesque blank sheet and elec-
table image for the Democrats. 

And that leaves me about a para-
graph for Total Recall . I touched on 
this abomination of mankind already 
in my Sept. 29 column. It was over-
all JUSt another downer for this 
Democrat. Could Lt. Gov. Cruz 
Bustamante have put together a 
worse campaign' I Ie comes out days 
after the stgnatures for Total Recall 
are cerofied and starts talking about 
"Tough Love" for the citizens. Cruz 
imrnediately whipped together a 
plan to raise revenue through a vari-
ety of taxes. It wasn't so much the 
size of the taxes (25 cents on every 
galion of alcohol, for example) as it 
was that items were going to be 
taxed everywhere you look. 
Californians weren 't about to accept 
any responsibilty for the deficit. 

10tal Recall was about putting 
people over politicians. Tough Love 
was about as popular as the taxes 
leVied on the colorusts leading up to 
the American Revolution - mone-
tarily ~mall 111 comparison, but 
nonetheless very unwelcome 
because of the broad range of Items 
that were further taxed. 

I can't wait for Gov . . \rnold 
chwarzenegger's budget proposal. 

Isn't that the type of thing we nlll in

6 OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, ocr BER 16. Z003 

Schwarzenegger's administration troubling to the left 
Comparisons to former governor should be a matter of concern 
By JESSICA UNGEL 

Opinion Editor 

In the wake of the 0 t. 7 recall , 
an elecnon that has Republicans 
shouting "Finally'" and 
Democrats shaking their heads in 
uner bafflement, a refrain from 
both side has been the subcon-
scious comparisons between 
Governor-elect Arnold 

chwarzenegger and former gov-
ernor Ronald Reagan. 

Both were actors, both are con-
ervative and both are marked by 

financial policy that had a lot of 
hype and a lot of myths. 

Of course Reagan actually had a 
political career to back his rise to 
governor tatus while all 

chwarzenegger has is the aston-
ishing ability to windle his way 
into power. But that's another issue. 

The real danger of these com-
panson wou ld be to Idealize 
Reagan' time in office a some-
thing Californians should hope to 
repeat. If anyth ing, Reagan's eco-
nomic policies on both the state 
and federal level were mi guided 
and misapplied, and once the myths 
are separa ted from the reality, it 

become clear that the last person 
who should be serving as a guber-
natorial precedent is Ronald 
Reagan . 

Schwarzenegger spoke glow-
ingly about the wonderful days of 
the 1960s, when, in 

chwarze negger 's words, " thi s 
great state said to the people 
everywhere : Come here, work 
hard, play by the rules and your 
dreams can come true." 

In 1968, California was a high-
tax state - among the top lO in the 
country. The previous year, 
California's newly-instated 
Republi ca n governor, Ronald 
Reagan, had just called for and 
signed the biggest tax increase in 
the history of any state. 

Throughout the recall , taxation 
was a11 issue. Republican candidates 
Schwarzenegger and tate en. 
10m McClintock repeated time 
and time again that they would 
work to lower taxes in the great tra-
dition of conservative economic. 
Bur after looki ng at what tho e 
kind of policics have done in the 
past, that stra tegy should be a con-
cern for citizens across the political 
spectrum - not just in California. 

Single in 

The total federal tax burden 
increased during the Reagan 
years, and most Americans paid 
more in taxes after Reagan than 
before. The "Reagan Recovery" 
was unremarkable. It looks great 

" I t would be not only 
astonishing but extermely 

disquieting to see 
[Schwarzenegger's] office 
repeat the mistakes of the 

past. " 
only contrasted against the dismal 
Reagan recession - but it had 
nothing to do with supply side 
henanigans. 

With a red ink explosion -
300 billion deficits looming as 

far as the eye cou ld see - GOP 
Senator , notably incl uding Bob 
Dole, led the way o n tax hikes. 
The economy enjoyed its recovery 

only after tax increases larger than 
the total tax cuts were implement-
ed. Perhaps most importantly, in 
terms of an administration-by-
administration analysis, average 
annual gross domestic product 
growth during the Reagan '80s 
was lower than during the Clinton 
administration. 

T he only argument that should 
rally the fiscaUy conservative is 
the possibility of wanting to gen-
erate huge deficits as a r, ' ~l:ha ni sm 
for ensuring small governments. 
It was Reagan who cried, "Get the 
government off our backs!" To 
that end, the far right could 
encourage restricted budgets 
because it means that there is no 
possibility of creating social pro-
grams and no possibility of financ-
ing a big government. If this 
seems extreme or alarming, that's 
becau e guaranteeing one's aims 
through an economic stronghold 
is not a justifiable meth o d. ff 
social programs are to be cur, It 
should be done through the will of 
the people, not through manipu-
lation of taxatIOn lhat indirecrly 
assures an extremist agenda.

compare fiscal policy then with fis -
cal policy now. Perhaps it seem 
si lly to look at the federal level in 
the context of a state position. But 
it is most certainly relevant to con-
sider trends that have been made 
apparent within the presidential 
agenda and apply them to a more 
local context. 

California has grown increas-
ingly conservative over the past 
decade, despi te its i mage as a state 
filled with progressive left-wing 
liberals. So perhaps it isn't entire-
ly astonishing to see a Republican 
come to power in the recall elec-
tion, although it was certainly a 
rude awakening for liberals. 

It would be not only astonishing 
but extremely disquieting to see his 
office repeat the mistakes of the 
pa t. \Vi th the com pa risons to a 
predece~sor who e legacy is any-
thing but admirable, concern over 
history repeating Itself could very 
well consti une the only humor that 
liberal will be able to find in the 
aftermath of the Ocr. 7 election.

and Schwarzcnt:ggcr will have in

attempt to let a certain group know 
they are not wanted or welcome on 
this campus." 

Other students present vocal-
ized their concern over the target 
of the Koala issue. 

"You don't print ixteen pages 
of things that are going to hurt a 
specific group of people without 
sayi ng you have something against 
them," Revelle College junior Tess 
,\!leis ner said. "And I don't feel my 
tUition hould go toward this." 

John MUir College senior Sina 
Shayesteh echoed the sentiment. 

"If I knew this was going to be 
happening on my campus, I would 
not have come to this school," 
Shayesteh sa id. "['m very co n-
cerned for the girls who are wear-
ing the hijab, which is the scarf, 
about how the campus is going to 
take this. The people who read 
thiS, they're going to look at them 
differently." 

The Koala wheeled the cart 
back toward the Student Center, 
where its office is located, once 
Aguilar notified them that they 
were in violation of the "time, 
place and manner policy," because 
they had not registered to be dis-
tributing on Library Walk, wruch

"They did not have permission

of the occurrence by a phone call. 
"O hviously they were causi ng 
some di rupoon, but that was not 
my primaty concern." 

Aguilar said if they had 
obtained prior approval for the 
space and posed no threat to the 
health and safety of students , or of 
damaging property, "they would

Campaign: UCSD looks 
to private sectors for funds 

cominued from page c 
Though there have been some sig-
nificant gifts to the social sciences 
and humanities area, Langley says 
they are not as large as the ones 
received for health and sciences. 

"We try to be as balanced as 
we can in securing support, but 
ultimately donors decide - when 
we present them with a menu of 
opportunities - which programs 
they think are most worthwhile," 
Langley said. "When you deal 
with social sciences and humani-
ties, it usually takes more time." 

Alumni are also a source for 
donations. Although not as large 
as some donations received, the 
alumni network has been an 
important aspect of the campaign. 

"We need to do a better job 
with current students, making 
them a part of this campus, making 
them feel that they have a voice and 
a stake in this campus before they 
leave," Langley said. "Because if 
they don't and they leave, we spend 
a lot of time and a lot money trying 
to re-engage them." 

However, amid budget cuts and 
increasing student fees, some have 
wondered whether the money 
should be used for services that 
affect current UCSD students. 

"It's positive that we have out-
side resources coming in to make 
the universi ty better," Jeremy 
Cogan, A.S. Commissioner of 
Enterprise Operations said . "But 
at the same time, a lot of that is 
going to academic departments, 
going to research studies and to 
things that don't directly benefit 
students on an everyday basis." 

One aspect of the campaign 
affecting students is the effort to 
raise money for scholarships in. 

"It always adds up to choices," 
Langley said. "The best way we 
can help students while they're 
here is to at least defray the costs 
of their education." 

According to Langley, there 
have been gifts that will directly 
affect students, including dona-
tions for a softball fie ld and physi-
cal improvements to the campus. 

"\Vhile it is benefiting the 
stature of the university to make 
UCSD a more prominent cam-
pus, it's not necessarily benefiting 
students wi th day-to-day needs," 
Cogan said. "There hasn't yet 
been any evidence that it will help 
outreach, or recruitment and 
retention programs, and that is a 
major necessity for students."

concinued from page j 

In Islam, people are nOt born 
sinners; therefore, they do not 
need to be "saved," he said. 

Muslims also believe in a day of 
judgment in which everyone will 
be held accountable for all their 
sins. This includes the belief in 
heaven and hell - two very physi-
cal and spiritual r~ities, according 
to Fazag:a. 

Some important Islamic prac-
tices and part of the Five Pillars of 
Faith include five daily prayers. 
Following the example of the 
prophet Muhammad, Muslims are 
to perform the five daily prayers 
facing Mecca, the "sacred holy 
city" and birthplace of 
Muhammad, Fazaga said. 

Fazag:a explained that Ramadan 
is particularly important to 
Muslims because it is the month in 
which Muhammad was said to 
receive the revelation of the 
Qur'an in addition to pan of the 
Five Pillars of Islam. 

During this time, all able-bod-
ied Muslims are to abstain from 
food, drink, smoking and sexual 
behavior from dawn until dusk for 
a period of 30 days. Muslims 
believe that this practice of self-
denial helps one to become more 
in tune with those who are in 
need. 

The MSA hopes to open the 
eyes of the UCSD community to 
Islam through education. 

"[Islam Awareness Week] has 
been going really well, " MSA 
President Amir Fahid said. "There 
has been a lot of positive feed-
back." 

continued from page I 
certain laws in our tate that pro-
tect workers and Ralphs and 
A1bensons are in violation of 
these laws." 

Added to the state labor code 
in 2002, the law requires compa-
nies with more than 75 workers 
to notify their employees at least 
60 days before large layoffs, relo-
cations or terminations. 

"Our Ralphs and A1bertsons 
employees were not laid off but 
they were locked out," said 
Ralphs spokesman Terry 
0' eil. 

According to O'Neil, lockouts 
are permitted under the Federal 
National Labor Relations Act 
and are excluded from the layoff 
notification law. 

"We have just been served 
with the lawsuit so we have not 
had time to review it," O'Neil 
said . "However, it's apparent 
from the description of the law-
suit, we believe, that it is com-
pletely without merits under 
both California and federal law, 
and that it will quickly be adjudi-
cated in favor of Ralphs and 
A1bertsons. " 

The lawsuit comes just four 
days after the union called for a 
strike, with UFCW representa-
tives walking out of contract 
negotiations with the three 
chains and federal mediators on 
Oct. 4. 

The call for a walkout only 
targeted Vons employees, with 
the union hoping to spare incon-
venience to consumers by target-
ing only the biggest company. 

Both Ralphs and A1bertsons 
responded by locking out their 
employees on Oct. 5. 

"The unions and the Ralphs 
and Albertsons employees they 
represent cannot legitimately 
claim any surprise or prejudice by 

this lockout," Ralphs repre enta-
tives sta ted in a press release. 
"The unions agreed well in 
ad,rance that because they were 
negotiating jointly with Ralphs, 
A1bertsons and Vons, if they initi-
ated a strike against any of the 
companies, it would be deemed a 
strike against all three and the 
employees they represent would 
be locked Out by the non-struck 
companies." 

Despite the timing of the law-
suit, with companies preparing 
for a long-term walkout, Anreder 
said the move was not meant to 
gain leverage for future negotia-
tions but represented an attempt 
to recover lost wages for emp.loy-

" I hope it goes weU far the 
people picketing so that 

they resolve the problems 
soon. It 's very 
inconvenient. "

CoIIep sophomore 

ees. 

Though the filing did not list 
damages, the total amount may 
be in the hundreds of millions, 
she said. 

A1bertsons and Ralphs, which 
received official notice of the 
legal action on Oct. IS, have 30 
days to file a response with the 
superior court in Los Angeles, 
where union officials filed the 
complaint. 

For customers like John Muir 
College sophomore Grant 
Wang, who occasionally shops at 

the three chains, the lawsuit did 
not change his mind about the 
strike. 

"1 hope it goes well for the 
people picketing so that they 
resolve the problems soon," 
Wang said. "It's very inconve-
nient." 

Five days after the strike 
began, no scheduled talks are on 
the horiron. 

"There have been no meet-
ings since the union walked away 
from the bargaining table 
Saturday evening and there are 
no meetings scheduled," O 'Neil 
said. 

Union officials and companies 
resumed negotiations up until 
Oct. II, even though 97.4 per-
cent of the 70,000 grocery work-
ers voted for a strik.e on Oct. 8. 
However, the two parties were 
unable to reach a compromise, 
with unions objecting to health 
premiums and wage cuts for new 
employees. 

T hough all three chains said 
that stores would remain open 
and have hired temporary work-
ers for the duration of the dis-
pute, they have come under 
even more pressure after mem-
bers of the Teamsters' and bak-
ers' union pledged to support 
the UFCW. 

At some stores, Teamster 
truck drivers parked the trucks at 
the front, unwilling to cross the 
picket lines and forcing store 
managers to complete the deliv-
eries. 

Many customers have also 
decided to do their shopping 
elsewhere, in support of the 
unioni~ed workers or simply 
because they are reluctant to pass 
through the protestors. 

"I don't wane to go through 
the hassle of going through the 
picket lines,' Wang said. 

continued from page 3 
more options if the university were 
to release their records in violation 
of FERPA," A.S. Commissioner of 
Judicial Affairs Jeffrey Boyd aid. 
"[The bill) would persuade the uni -
versity to be more compliant with 
FERPA, allowing the Department 
of Education to deny funds to 
those universities that would pur-
posely violate the act." 

According to Aguilar, the adden-
dum to FERPA may result in "the 
increase of unnecessary lawsuits that 
would only divert the funds and 
resources of public universities from 
their primary mission of education 
to pay for the litig:ation. 

"IThe bill] won't provide any 
greater insurance for privacy and 
security than there presently is," 
Aguilar said . "It would only 
intimidate those administrators 
acting in good faith, who are in 
charge of thousands of student 
records." 

There have been relatively few 
cases at UCSD regarding a viola-
tion of FERPA, according to 
Aguilar. 

"There have been less than 10 
in the past 20 yea rs, and all have 
been resolved to the satisfaction of 
the student and/or the U.S . 
Department of Education," 
Aguilar said. 

The campus has been secure in 
ensuring the privacy of its students, 
according to Boyd. 

"UCSD has always erred on the 
side of caution in regards to the 
policy of FERPA," Boyd aid. 

Congress is expected to vote on 
the bill sometime this full .

1I0pUS Cactus" 
brings a magical 
flair and twist to 

Mandeville 
I t is pure indulgence for the eyes when nature is transformed into interpretive 3rt. The southwestern 
Sonoran Desert of Ari~ona becomes a 
sensual and artistic illusion in "Opus 
Cactus," a contemporary dance by the 
phenomenal dance group Momix. The 
melange of Joshua Starbuck's lighting 
design and the dancers' circus-like tech-
niques give the audience a delightful 
experience of potent visual sensations. 
"Opus Cactus" is an open window 
through which to view the bountiful and 
beautiful mysteries of the desert in the 
form of imaginative dance. 

The performance almost literally takes 
the many different and interesting life 
forms found within the cosmic ground of 
the southwestern desert and places them 
upon Momix's stage in the form of aston-
ishing human physical talent. 

The dancers are, to say the least, 
mesmerizing as an ensemble from a vari-
ety of backgrounds in ballet, acrobatics, 
gymnastics and modern dance. Among 
these performers is Kara Oculato, a clas-
sically trained dancer who defies biolog-
ical limitations of the human body. She 
and the other "Opus Cactus" dancers 
disguise them elves as dream-like 
images of desert plants and animals, all 
of which are products of the choreogra-
pher Moses Pendleton. 

The 1998 recipient of the Connecticut 
Commission on the Arts' Governor's 
Award and the magic brain behind many 
successful dance orchestrations, 
Pendleton has received great admiration 
for this new contemporary art piece. He 
put together an array of "dancer-illusion-
ists" on a simple stage to represent and 
bring forth the beauty of a desert clearly 
hidden behind its own vastness. 

With snakes slithering across the 
stage, Gila monsters ferociously roam-
ing about the background and tumble-
weeds lightly tumbling, "Opus Cactus" 
imitates the life forms of the southwest-
ern desert with ease and success, thanks 
to the dazzling costume work of Phoebe 

Kat~in, sculptural art of Alan Boeding

the entirety of the contemporary dance. 
The imagination of Momix, via 

Moses Pendleton and his crew, has no 
boundaries . Simplici ty can transform 
into natural intricacy, plain props into 
elaborate dancing tools, and natural 
human bodies into bending works of art. 

Dark silhouettes against bright skies, 
grand statuesque cactuses and sexy slith-
ering snakes in the dances all encompass a 
sense of sensuality Momix found in the 
desert. In one of the segments, the purely 

Momix-esque duet "Dream Catcher" 
enacts a surreal dream of the nightly 
stars positioned within the background 
of the Sonoran Desert in which they 
expel away bad dreams in search of good 
ones. Another fiery sequence is 
"Sundance," in which four women 
(dancers Kori Darling, Nicole 
Loizides, Kara Oculato and Cynthia 
Quinn) incorporate large taut fans 
attached to their costumes into a smooth 
dance. Momix surprises the audience 
with how very simple (and sometimes 
even plain) props can bring forth intri-
cately woven dances. 

Known for its ingenuity and glamor-
i~ing of natural physical wonders, 
Momix does it again with its musical 
soundtrack. "Opus Cactus" is set to this 
variety of New Age, classical, traditional 
and modern music. An eclectic medley 
of music from different backgrounds, 
the soundtrack consists of music from 
Johann Sebastian Bach, Brian Eno, 
Douglas Spotted Eagle, an Australian 
aboriginal group and Dead Can Dance. 
The specifics of the music do not matter, 
however, since the focus should be on 

Fortunately, Momix is coming back to 
UCSD with "Opus Cactus" to dazzle its 
guests with its explosion of colors, music, 
beauty and, more importantly, dance. Be 
prepared to settle down to a corporeal cel-
ebration of the Sonoran Desert and all its 
natural beauty. 

Among these egments, ·Opus 
Cactus" embeds many ritual dances, 

This theatrical dance performance is 
split into 19 segments and will take place 
at Mandeville Auditorium on Oct. 17 at 
7:30 p.m. General admission tickets are 
$25, $ 15 for students, and $24 for facul-

entence composed by writer 

David Sedaris: "That shit 
don't mean fuck to me." 

The famous phrase wa 
taken from a story about 
edari' younger brother, 

Paul, entitled "You Can't I(jll

Sedaris ' material, the piece i 
about hi family and the hilar-

edaris al 0 writes on other 
topics: the Chri tina myth 
of foreign conn tries, gun law 
in variou tat and portable 

ternal catheters, to name a 
e ..... No mattec what hi uh-

ject, the characteristic dry 
prose in which it is written 
makes for a riotous read. 

Perhap the only rival to 
rcading David edaris is hear-
ing David edaris read him-
self. The audience at hi 
upcoming preckels Theatre

experience. Hi voice, which 
he desc! ibes as "high-pitched 
and girli h," is also dry and 
monotone, and p rfect for 
mocking. It is the ideal medi-
um for communicating the 
eyebr w- lifted amu ement 
and ardonic wit in which hi

yea r i nce then, he has 
authored the books "Barrel

"Naked," and "Me Talk Pretty 

ne Day," a best-selling col-
lection of essays about his own 
life. He ha also contributed 
frequently to Esquire and 
NPR, and has co-written sev-
eral plays wi th his sister Amy

make its way to the silver

upreme over hi particular 

brand of humorous es ay, 

incorporating elements of 
remarkable intimacy and 
honesty into many of his

Thi is especially notice-
able during his readings. In 
one breath he describes the 
half- mocking justification he

'Mystic River' boggles the mind 
Clarity compromised by the current movie ideals 

By DAVID BYNUM 
Senior Staff Writer 

One of the great virmes of having a living legend direct a film is that he is 
sure to a ttract a grea t cast. 
"Mystic River," if nothing 
else, is a wonderful ensemble 
of leading men playing emo-
tionally challenging roles. 
The story is nOt of one man 
but of one event, and how 
that event affects the lives of 
three men. Consequently, 
there is no lead role and the 
film is able to take full advan-
tage of the entire cast that 
Clint Eastwood's presence 
was able to attract. 

Tim Robbins, Sean Penn 
and Kevin Bacon play boy-
hood friends who are still 
reeling from a tragedy in their 
youth. A murder mystery 
ensues and the boys-turned-
men find themselves on three 
different sides of the caper. 

Unlike most crime films 
that mrn quicldy on the 
smallest of plot details, the 
artistry of "Mystic River" is 
delivered far more carefully 
than its storyline. 
Cinerrutically, the film was 
nearly flawless. There is a 
dark and brooding nervous-
ness throughout the entire 
film. The constant tension 
starts immediately and does-
n't give up until halfway 
through the drive home. 
This deliberate apprehen-
sion comes without warning, 
apology or climax. While 
Eastwood never puts the 
audience on the edge of its 
seat, he never let them relax 
either. 

It is difficult to say quite 
where the film fits; despite its 
blockbuster potential and 
thriller-like elements, it 
incorporates a number of

Film 
REVIEW 

independent themes through 
obrusely placed philo ophical 
references and innovative cin-
ematography. The filmmak-
ers seemed unwilling to com-
mit to a wholly original feat, 
and got bogged down pander-
ing to those who were all-too-
delighted to devour the status 
quo. The film u1tinutely fails 
itself because it ends up lost in 
the void between moneymak-
ing ~nd mind bending. 

This problem manifests 
itself in a number of differ-
ent ways, most notably in the 
perplexing final minutes. 
This is one of those rare 
films that can't get out of its 
own way. While the tangen-
tial red herrings throughout 
the film help to keep the 
viewer guessing, they also 
leave the film with the cum-
ber orne task of tying up too 
many loose ends. Bacon's 

character has a love-life 
problem, the purpose of 
which seems to have gotten 
lost on the cutting room 
noor. Similarly Laura 
Linney, who plays Penn's 
wife in the film, has a two-
minute monologue during 
the finale that comes out of 
left field . 

While the film creates a 
wonderful in-theater experi-
ence, it crumbles under clos-
er scrutiny. In due course, 
the film's virtues outweigh 
its problems, and is a must-
see for fans of Penn, 
Robbins, Bacon or 
Eastwood. While the execu-
tion of "Mystic River" is far 
outstretched by its potential, 
it is nonetheless a very good 
effort.

'Boys Next Door' is brilliant 
Lamb's Players' favorite returns with heartfelt acting 
By JESSICA LONG 

Senior Staff Writer 

The final production of Lamb's Players Theatre's 2003 season IS "The 
Boys Next Door," running 
now through Nov. 16. First 
stllged by the company in 
1991, this play remains one of 
the company's most request-
ed productions. 

"'The Boys Next Door" 
mixes large amounts of 
humor with hean-wrenching 
drama to tell the Story of four 
developmentlllly disabled 
men: Arnold, Lucien, 
Nonnan and Barry, who all 
live in a group home. Jack 
Palmer, the supemsor, loolcs 
after them while trying to 
deal with the problems in his 
own life. 

The actors do a superb 
job of bringing their char-
acters to life , showing their 
own personal struggles 
while also exploring the 
unique relationships they 
have with each other. Paul 
Maley plays Arnold, a 
hyper and always-nervous 
character who talks a mile a 
minute about "behavioral 
pattern" and Russia . 
Maley's energy i astound-
ing and gives life to the 
play. Keith Jefferson plays 
Lucien, the most di abled 
member of the group. 
Jefferson doe an impres-

sive job of making Lucien 
endearing as a grown man 
with less mental capacity 
than a five-year-old . 

Robert Smyth plays 
onnan, a caring, yet often 

worried man with a love for 
donuts. Smyth does well at 
showing the relationship 
between his character and 

Theater 
REVIEW 

Sheila, played by Deborah 
Gilmour myth. Nick 
Cordileone play Barry, a 
schizophrenic who fancies 
himself a golf professional, 
offering I ns for 25 cents. 
He does a spectacular job of 
moving between being per-
hap the most seemingly 
"normal" of the men to being 
nonresponsive after a visit by 
his father, played by Doren 
EJias. That is perhaps one of 
the most dramatic and fright-
ening scenes of the play. 

Jon Lorenz plays Palmer, 
the man who supervises rhe 
men living in the group 
home. Lorenz hows both 
the frustration and the 
reward that comes with 
Palmer's job :u well a hi 
conflict between wanting I 
les tressful job and f, eling 
that h.e owes it LO the men he 
looks after to tJly. 

One of the best features 
of this play is the cnding. 
Rather than a concrete end-
ing where everyone has 
come to terms with the 
events of the tory, there is 
not a complete resolution. 
The audience doesn 't know 
what happens to some of the 
characters and nothing is 
permanently ettled for any 
of them. I r makes the story 
seem much more true-to-
life, allowing the audience to 
believe that life continues on 
for these characters. 

This stOry is often funny, 
occasionally saddening, but 
always insightful. It offers a 
unique look into the lives of 
people often ignored or even 
shunned by society. "The 
Boys Next Door" is showing 
at the Lamb's Player 
Theatre in Coronado 
through Nov. 16. Tickets 
range in price from $20 to 
$40 and can be purchased 
either by calling the Lamb's 
Player's Theatre box office 
at (6 19) 437-0600 or by 
ordering online at

-album reviews 

Two whirlwind years after 
releasing a debut, the origi-
nal "The" band is back, sur-
prisingly unfazed. 
"Whatever Happened?" 
opens the album on a high 
note with their now- familiar, 
rerro-minded minimalism. 
It's a great song, to be sure, 
but how call the trokes get 
away with e senlially making 
the same album again? 

Is Teenage Fanclub one 
of the best, most overlooked 
bands of the last 15 years? 
This "greatest hits" collec-
tion certainly argues that 
point convincingly. 

The Scottish band sepa-
rated itself from the Brit-pop 
pack through employing 
more of a power-pop influ-
ence in the vein of also-over-

what makes the second song,

guitars. Its melody is imme-
diately memorable and gets

that is sure to make any Joy

The highly-anticipated 
Thr Decline of British ta 
PUWtr brilliantly meshes 
thrashing guitar riffs and lush 
chord progressions to create a 
sound that i mature and 
respectful of the 19 Os and 
1990s post-punk scene. The 

out overdoing it at all . It 
sounds incredible. 

The same goes for the 
new-wave guitar riot "12:51," 
currently burning up the 
charts, for the surprisingly 
slow and pretty ballad "Under 
ConO'ol" and the train-chug-
ging "Automatic Stop." Same 
goes for the entire album, 
which is not classic like the 
first album was, but more 
consistent. By never relenting 
on their rhythmic attack and 
paying equal attention to 
memorable melodies and 
sophisticated but lo-fi onies, 
the O'okes refine their ound 
without 10 ing their touch.

dramatic guitars. It is literal -
Iya perfect pop song and sets 
the stage for similarly pris-
tine tunes like the bouncy 
"Star Sign" and grunge bal-
lad "Mellow Doubt." 

With three talented 
songwriters, incredible gui-
tar work and an undying love 
for sweet pop melodies, it's a 
wonder Teenage Fanclub 
never moved beyond cult 
status. But like their power-
pop forefathers, if time 
serves them well, they'll be 
remembered as classics.

album quickly picks up with 
the screeching, up-tempo 
anthem "Apologies to Insect 
Life," which displays single-

breathy vocals and obmse 
lyrical references such 3S "Oh 
Molasses, it' like bad acid." 

Halfway through, the 
album transforms into a 
beautiful display of mu ical 
swell and mid-tempo ballads 
such as the emotional, 
Springsteen-e que whispers 
in "Something Wicked." BSP 
will certainly be a band to 
watch for in years to come.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, OCTOBER 16, 2003 

Hollywood: Put on your thinking caps! 
sho~ are~e 

Deena AI Shatti 

There's something rotten in the state of California . And, no, I'm not JUSt tal Icing about 
Arnold Schwarzenegger winning 
the recall election. 

I'm talking about the absolute 
lack of creativity in Hollywood. 

As an entertainment jun1c.ie, I 
watch a lot of television. The 30-
minute shows are just enough to 
hold my attention while I'm 
avoiding homework. But even that 
can't distract me anymore. Half of 
the time, the things o n my televi-
sion screen are so horrifically 
insipid, it's a wonder they even 
made it on the air. 

Just one example: "The Real 
World" and its sister shows "Road 
Rules " and "The Real 
WorldlRoad Rules Challenge." It 
used to be that I would eagerly 
await each new episode, reveling 
in the unnecessary drama these 
fame-who res would create. But 
even now, it's becoming too 
much. I'm watching the latest sea-
son (taped in Paris) and si lently 
cursing the ingrates who are liv-
Ing rent-free in a gorgeous ciry 
and yet pend all their time bick-
eri ng about ham and the fact that 
they have to (gasp I) be at the 
"office" for five hours. 

But this IS typical of nearly all 
reality shows, which seem to have 
taken' over the television 1I1dustry. 
And for the few remaining fic-
tionalized shows, it 's not much 
better. 

Take the cra pfest "7th 
Heaven, " known fo r being a 
wholesome fun-for - the-whole-
family show. The show started out 
as a cheesy guilry pleasure, but has 
since downgraded into a show 
that sends out the worst messages. 

It seems that on this show, as well 
as on many other dramas on the 
WE network, women simply can-
not stand up for themselves and 
instead rely on the manly men to 
do their bidding. Please, can't the 
WE just give us one kick-ass 
female character? They've been 
going steadily down the crapper 
ever since they lost "Buffy the 
Vampire Slayer." 

It's a sad state of affairs when 
almost every show on television is 
pure drivel. And, admitted ly, T 
watch it. T here's something about 
watching shit that makes us feel 
just a little bit better about our-
selves, in a "wow, at least I'm not 
that lamel" kind of way. You know 
- the feeling you got after watch-
ing "Joe MilIionaire" or the pre-
liminary rounds of "American 
Idol." 

" Half the time I the things 
on the big screen are so 

completely uninspired that 
I want to swb my eyes 

out with red,hot pokers in 
an effort to entertain 

myself. " 
But it's not just the tele\'ision 

shows that are laclcing creativity. 
Every so often, I fork over the bil-
lion dollars it costs to see a movie 
these days and half the time the 
things on the big screen are so 
completely uninspired that I want 
to stab my eyes out with red-hot 
pokers in an effort to entertain 
myself. I'm talking about the crap 
that is films such as "Dumb and 
Dumberer," "Daddy Daycare" and 
"From Justin to Kelly" (yes, yes, I 
sadly saw that one, can we alI move 
on now?). 

HolIywoodl What's going on? 

Is life really so duIJ that you simply 
cannot come up with any creative 
plots? It has become so tedious that 
anyone of us could write a screen-
play and have it be identical to the 
nonsense that's already playing on 
the big screen. 

The criteria is simple: The films 
are nearly alI either inadequate 
adaptations of books ("Under the 
Tuscan Sun," "Le Divorce, " 
"Seabiscuit"), really shitty 
sequel/prequels ("Terminator 3," 
"American Wedding," "Jeepers 
Creepers"), or just remakes of 
older movies ("The Texas 
Chainsaw Massacre," "The Italian 
Job"). Of course, not all the movies 
I listed were the bad ones - but 
thats way too many movies within 
a three-month period that have had 
no creativity attached to them at 
all . 

I'm sure these Hollywood 
heavyweights know people who 
know people who know peopl e 
who lead somewhat ordinary lives. 
Is it not possible to take a page or 
two from their life and make it into 
a film? I'm not tallcing about writ-
ing the next Oscar-winner, I'm just 
aying that they should spend the 

bill ions of dollars they have on 
making a halfway decent film that 
isn't ripping off an older film o r a 
book plot. I'm tired of scanning the 
movie listings and seeing that thc 
only good films are fore ign or 
independenr ones. ""hat happened 
to films like "The Godfather," 
"E.T." and "Silence of the Lambs"? 

At the end of the da}', this I~ what 
Hollywood needs to do: Go out and 
use the bi llions and billions of dol-
lars you have to rure reol screenwrit-
ers who have actual ideas and cre-
ativity and have them write your 
cripts! I know they're out there -

I've een their indie films. Fund 
these films or come up with new 
ideas and new scripts. There are 
only so many times you can rewrite 
the teen movie. There are only so 
many rimes you can redo a horror 
flick. You get the idea. 

And, for the sake of all things 
holy, don 't ever let Jennifer Lopez 

Agent: Out tanding actor redeem the film 
conunued from page I I 

stantly pops in, asking Fin to hang 
out and IIlqUiring about Olivia, dis-
regarding Fin's wishes to be left 
alone . Actor Bobby Can navale 
give an enthusla tic performance 
as the overzealous Cuban snack-
stand owner, giVing the film a 
much-needed lock of energy. 

Joe, Fin and Oltvla spend more 
and more time together, develop-
ing an awkward frie ndship that is 
somehow enurely beltevable. 

Credit the outstandlIlg perfor-
mance of the three leads for carry-
lIlg a film that could have been 
welghtle s without them. 
McCarthy's over-economical script 
clouds the characters' past and pre-
sent Itves WIth unanswered ques-
tions. The approach IS commend-
able, especially 10 thi age when 

~creenwrlter rarely adhere to the 
'\how-don 't- tell" nile of wrlUng. 
Ultimately, that make~ the charac-
ters seem underdeveloped rather 
than mysterious. 

The film al 0 has Its share of 
art-hou~e film vices such as odd 
characters who are overly anxious 
to display thei r quirk . Michelle 
Will iams (bes t known for her role 
on ~ Dawson 's reek" as Jen) and 
young Raven GoodWill give uni -
formly excellelll and underrated 
performances. Williams' vaguely 
slurty librarian girl with a good 
h an and odwin 's lonely black 
gIrl WIth an eq ually good heart 
eem more like caricature than 

real cha ra cter~. 
Sull, the film has Ill> strong 

points. The character must deal 
with their own individual tragedie 
tIl a number of touching scenes, 

Counesy 01 Miramax

and the unlikely fnendship makes

Water polo: Tritons looked 
fatigued in 9;4 loss to Waves 

continued from page 20 
biggest game on Oct. 12 at 
Pepperdine's pool. 

" It wasn 't an issue of prepa\ a-
tion, " Borso said. "Playing even 
games in seven days is tough . We 
are in condition, but mentally and 
physically we weren't ready." 

The team struggled in this game 
more than they have in recent 
games. Man-up offenses were not 
converted to goal opportunities and 
counterattacks were usually un uc-
cessful . 

The fatigued team failed to per-
form at its peak, especia lly against 
the third-ranked Pepperdine 

Waves, a team composed of many 
of the league'S tOP players. 

"To tell you the truth, th.is was 
one of the worst games of the year. 
It was the worst game of the year. 
We were lethargic," Borso said. 
"Everything JUSt seemed to fall 
apart. Hopefully we can get it 
behind us." 

The Tritons get a short break 
this week before playing their next 
scheduled game at No. 9 Loyola 
Marymount on Oct. 17, then 
another against the UCSD alumni 
team at 11 a.m. on Oct. 18 in an 
exhibition game at Canyonview 
Pool.

to the Pepperdlne Waves and were limited to Just one goal In each period

will make UCSD sporting events 
more appealing. I mean, why go to 
a party if theres no alcohoP 

There\; nothing like free beer to 
motivate people to go out and cheer 
for the home team. ThIs is especial-
ly true living in San Diego, where 
there's undoubtedly a plethora o f 
things competing for our attention. 
Even if they charged a nominal 
"beer garden admission fee," it'd be 
better than no beer at all. 

We all know booze works won-
ders when it comes to losing your 
inhibitions. Beer 

" 

goals or points will be cored. That 
could make all the difference If the 
Tritons are behind in the game or 
playmg in overtime. Beer gardens 
mean we have more fans at UCSD 
... the 'Thtons play better ." we Will 
more often I Now, IS that uch a bad 
thing' Honestly, I don't know what 
el e this school can do to get more 
fans to come out. adly, winning 
doe n't seem to be reason enough to 
support our teams. 

By the way, homecoming is th is 
weekend and there will be a beer 
garden before the men's soccer

louder and turns 
reserved people 
into crazy Yankee

there is free booze. 

Beer is proof that 
God loves us and

Po ly Pomona on 
Oct. 18. I guarantee 
that there ",,11 be a

match. Oh and 
look, the boys are III

- Benjamin Franklin n 111 g teJ III sounds like 3n C'\S\' 
chOice to llIe. if If you've 

watched any sports 
at all, you know that the louder and 
crazier the fans, the better the 
home team plays. The team feeds 
off of the thunderous environment. 
That's why it's difficult for VIsiting 
teams to win With loud drunks 
heckling them with creative chOice 
phrases, whether they are to egg on 
a winning team or bring down one 
that's losi ng. 

I laving that kind of crowd is 
like having an extra man our there. 
The more we can piss off and dis-
tract the opposing team, the better. 
Besides, Triton TIde is usually Out 
there being loud anyway, so we 
might as weII join in . 

The crazier UCSD fans get, the 
harder our team plays and the more

18 PORTS THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Harper reaches 400 wins 
Coach reflects on 23 years at UCSD 

By MAnHEW GIANT 
Contributing writer 

The Triton men's water polo 
victory on Oct. 8 in overtime 
against BYU-Hawaii marked the 
4{JOth career win for coach Denny 
Harper. 

Harper's career as a coach began 
In the fall of 1972 as a junior in 
high school, coaching girls high 
school water polo in Orange: 
County. 

"I found that my competitive-
ness a a player kind of carried over 
to the way that I coach. I wanted to 
do well. I liked it and did it for two 
more years," Harper said. 

Harper took a break from 
coaching to play at Santa Barbara 
City College before transferring to 
San Diego State University, where 
he was once again called to duty. 

"There happened to be a num-
ber of girls at San Diego State that 
[had] played for me in high school, 
and they asked me if I would start 
coaching the team at SDSU. That 
was January of 1976," Harper said. 

In 1980, when Harper assumed 
the role of head coach at UCSD, he 
was faced with a lack of adequate 
facilities and a team that he still 
dubs "the transition team." 

"They never really played any 
of the top teams," Harper said. 
"That year, we had four games on 
one weekend, and I took them to 
play UCLA and Long Beach State 
... and we just gOt killed . We went 
from a small, indoor pool to a giant 
thirty meter, all-deep one and just 
got killed. But to this day, almost 
25 years later, those guys are pretty 
stoked that they were part of what 
is referred to as the ' transition 
team.'" 

Harper's talent as a collegiate 
coach became quickly visible, how-
ever, when just one year later, his 
1981 squad placed 10th nationally. 
This was the first of several 
achievements that decorate 
Harper's career. 

"J've been lucky enough to be a 
pan of a lot of really neat things 
that have happened in the whole 
water polo world, so J just have a 
tendency to lump it all into one 
feeling of overachieving," Harper 
said. 

That overachievement includes 
five women's national titles, eight 
senior women's national club titles, 
13 Western Water Polo 
Association titles, several appear-
ances at nationals, two gold medals 
from the western women's water 
polo team at the United Sports 
Festival and, according to Harper, 
"a lot of great wins against teams 
that spent a hell of a lot more 
money on their water polo pro-
grams than we did." 

Though he is careful not to call 
it his best victory, Harper repeated-
ly mentions his team's quarterfinal 
upset over U niversi ty of Southern 
California at the 2000 national 
tournament, as one of his greatest 
moments as a coach. 

"That's about as David-and-
Goliath as you're going to get," he 
said. 

When asked about his favorite 
teams or best teams , Harper 
declined to single out any group, 
saying that each team he coached 
was entirely unique in its charac-
ter. According to Harper, each 
team is strongly influenced by [he 
one that preceded it and will have 
a strong influence on the one that 
follows. 

Courtesy 01 UCSD AIhIeIics 
Legacy: In his 23-year tenure, Denny 
Harper has won 13 IfNrJPA titles. 

Harper holds many traditions. 
"You could write a book on 

that," he said. "The traditions are 
sort of within the program and to 
me that makes it special. One of 
our major traditions is that once 
you make the ball club, we have 
double workouts, and every after-
noon we go to a different beach for 
six straight days. There is a lot of 
bonding that goes on through pain, 
torrure and agony." 

With regard to personal tradi-
tions and superstitions, Harper has 
a few that have continued from his 
days as a player into his coaching 
life. 

"I would say that maybe a half a 
decade ago, I got a handle on it, 
thinking, this is crazy. I could turn

the loose ball and gave the Tritons 
a 1-0 advantage. 

"He's really picked up his game 
recently," Armstrong said of 
Davey's play. "He had been plaYIng 
a mediocre eason, and it's good to 
see that he's picked it up recently." 

Cal State Bakersfield got the 
equalizer at the 54:07 mark. 
Roadrunner Andrew Kelley began 
the play down the right side and 
crossed the ball over to the far post, 
where freshman Brandon Migdol 
volleyed it m to the upper-fight cor-
ner of the nel. 

The game would remain oed for 
only a couple of seconds, however. 
UCSD regained the lead JUSt 26 sec-
onds later with a goal by Junior for-
ward ' [jago Venturi . The team 
leader for goals scored in 2002 
recorded just his second of 2003 
when he scored an unassisted goal 
from the [Op of the penalty box. 

With the two victOries, the 
Tmons improved to 8-3-1 overall 
and 7-3 - 1 in CCM action. Cal Poly 
Pomona's record fell to 8-6-1 over-
all, and 5-5-1 in conference play 
after its twO weekend losse to 
Chico State and UC Davis. The 
Broncos are tied for second place in 
the CM South division with Cal 
State Bakersfield, each with 16 
points apiece. First-place UCSD has 
22 points. 

With a victory over Pomona tIus 
weekend, the Tnron would VIrtual -
ly open a three-game lead over the 
Broncos With just three games 
remaining in the regular season. 

"If we can gel through this one, 
we'll be in good hape," Armstrong 
said. "We need to beat Pomona to 
almoS! clinch a pot." 

The TritOns' Oct. 18 division 
match against the Bronco will kick 
off at 2 p.m. at Triton occer 
Stadium as part of the 2003 
Homecoming festiviti .

injury. 
The second game was a differ-

ent story. Mter playing 90 minutes 
of flawless defense against 
Stanislaus, a second shutout bid 
didn't last five minutes against Cal 
State Bakersfield. The 
Roadrunners tallied an early goal at 
the 4:3 8 mark. 

"There was a little mix-up in the 
midfield," McManus said, "She 
made a magnificent shot that went 
lower V. There was no chance for 
[Lautenschleger] to make the save." 

The lritons answered back with 
two back-to-back goals, one com-
ing just before halftime and one 
right after the break. Three min-
utes before the break, freshman 
Heather Sugg headed home her 
fourth goal of the year, courtesy of 
a free kick from fellow freshman 
Megan Dickey. Dickey wa playing 
her first game since suffering an 
injury again t Chico State on Oct. 
3. 

"She had a grea t free lcick," 
McManus said of Dickey. 
Unfortunately, the injury flared up 
later and she was forced to leave the 
game. 

Three minutes after the break, 
the Tritons struck again with 
senior Kristen Conahan fini hing 
yet another cro s, this time a back-
poster from freshman Kelly 

Harper: 
Coach makes 
an impact on 

players 
continued from page ,8 

into an obsessive-compulsive 
coach, but I still have a few," 
Harper said. "There is only one 
urinal here [at Canyonview pool I 
that I have ever peed in . It's my 
lucky urinal, second from the far 
end and I've never peed in any 
other urinal. [£1 go in and someone 
is there, I'll wait." 

But Harper's accomplishments 
are not tallied on a wall in years, 
titles or vic[Ories. 

"At the risk of sounding a little 
corny, it wouldn't have anything [0 
do with beating so-and-so or win-
ning all these conference things, 
but for me, the greatest accom-
plishment i now seeing the alumni 
that [ have," Harper said. "It' a 
very tight group. T here are so 
many of them that are still here and 
still participating, playing master' 
polo. These are guys I was only a 
couple of year older than when [ 
sLarred coaching." 

I II connection with the alumni 
as well as with hIS currcnt player is 
evident In Harper's fatherly take on 
his role as a coach . 

"Those guys don't Illind, to uus 
day, telling me what it meant to 
play water polo at UC D and the 
influence that I had with their 
development in a pretty key devel-
opmental period," Harper said. "I 
am happy to say that our water polo 
program has provided the disci-
pline and direction and moral val-
ues that I think young men need at 
a pretty critical time." 

Chronology ha never played a 
ignificant role in the life of 

lla rper. He knows that he has 
achieved remarkable tcnure fr m 
his player and rudenrs at U D, 
but that only encourages him to 
continue, 

"I grew a beard when I was 18, 
so I never had IS ue~ With getting 
carded for be,:r or anything like 
that," Harper said . ''It wa around 
that period that I never really 
thought about my chron logical 
age. There have been a I t of 
benchmark thing that have hap-
pened in my hfe, and I think [hat 
may have something to do with 
the fa ct that I don't think about 
not dOing this." 

Cochran. Cochran then added one 
of her own in the 69th minute off 
of a corner. The goal increased her 
team-leading total to six. The 
assist was credi ted to senior 
defender and corner-specialist 
Christine Wensel. 

The Roadrunners added a goal 
in garbage-time, but senior Megan 
Mendoza squashed any hope of a 
miracle comeback with her fourth 
goal of the season. She was assisted 
by Sugg and senior Kristin Jones, 
who lead the team with eight 
helpers. 

UCSD has won four in a row 
since its first and only loss. a 3-2 
squeaker to Cal State Dominguez 
Hills. Asked if he felt his team was 
on a roll, McManus aid, "Yes, but 
we put it behind us - win or lose." 

UCSD now has a break of 13 
days before its next match at Cal 

State San Bernardino. What will 
the Tritons do with their free time' 

"Step up the fitness ," McManus 
said. "Lot's of two-a-days. Any 
team can go [into the playoffs] a 
No. I and sti ll lose. If it comes to 
two evenly matched tearns, J want 
our fitness to come through." 

That fitness could be a major 
factor against their next opponent. 
Cal State San Bernardino is the 
nearest competitor to UCSD in the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association South division. Last 
year, UCSD eked out a 1-0 victory, 
but coach McManus openly admits 
Cal State San Bernardino con-
trolled the entire game. 

"They make you work for 90 
minutes," he said. 

With the two wins, the Tritons 
are now 12 -I overall and \0-1 in 
CCAA action.

"Eros and Inwardness in Vienna" 
Vienna in the early twentieth century IS familiar to us u a great center of modem cultural 
and inte~tuaJ creativity, including Sigmund ","lid, Arthur Schnitzler, Ludwig Boltzmann, 
Ludwig Wingenstein, Karl Popper, Gustav Mahlel, Arnold SchOnberg, Gustav K1imt. and 
Oskar Kokoschlta. But our piclUre of Vienna 1900 IS powerfuUy shaped by our selectiVIty 
about what we remember Perhaps most promineol In our p,cture or this world is Sigmund 
FreUd. BUI we know very tittle about the ideas of inl.Uectuais outside the psychoanalytic 
movement who wrote about the unconscious, sexualil)', gender. and emouonal life. DaVId 
Lufl 's new book- Eros and Inwardness in Vienna (Chicago, 2003)-discusses the 
intellectual world of Vienna 1900 in relation 10 ideas about sexuality and gender. and 
explores ilIe views of three inteUectuais wbo presented impoMant alternatives to Freud. 
Professon Cox and Lull will discuss ilIose writen and the inteUectuaJ context that shaped

By George! I think I've got it! I 
know why our school is lacking in 
school spirit. There's a lack of beer 
gardens at our porting events. 

The last men's water polo game 
I anended at the Canyonview Pool 
had just about everything going for 
It: nice weather, many supportive 
fan and of cour e, lots of goals 
from our end of the pool. But, it 
was lacking in the craziness and 
rowdiness that only free alcohol 
can bring; the first game's beer gar-
den from the alumni brought in 
1,800 fans. The last game, sans 
beer garden, drew only 300. And 
tho e 300 were a lot more subdued 
even though UCSD embarrassed 
Long Beach State 8-21 

ince winning isn't enough to 
draw fans, perhaps beer gardens

The UCSD women's soccer 
squad justified their return to the 
top \0 in the national rankings 
after spending a week at No. II . 
The defen e led the way with a 1-
o shutout at Cal tate Stanislaus 
Oct. 10, while the offense made 
its presence known in a 4-2 victo-
ry over Cal State Bakersfield on 
Oct. 12 . The Tritons bounced 
back to No. 5 and celebrated their 
climb in the polls with two wins 
that could have come from two 
different teams. 

The lone goal of the first game 
came in the 38th minute of the 
first half. Freshman Alise Malley 
sent a cross to the back post 
where senior Sarah Schopbach 
and sent it home with a header. It 
was Schopbach's first goal of the 
eason and Malley'S first assist of 

her young collegiate career. 
The goal proved to be all the 

Tritons needed, since they played 
suffocating defense against a 
physical Cal State Stanislaus 
team. 

"The back three played a great 
game," head coach Brian 
McManus said, referring to the 
trio of seniors Heather 
Szafraniec, Christine Wensel and 
Molly Carlson. Cal State 
Stanislaus was limited to only 

four shots, with none of the four 
on frame. 

Consequently, neither junior 
keeper Jamie Lautenschleger nor 
sophomore goalie Alyson Berger 
was called upon to make a save. 
Lautenshleger played the opening 
half and Berger closed out the 
second half in a routine that has 
become familiar to the two 
Tritons in net. Asked if the lack of 
action was a concern for the pair 
of goalies, McManus said, "It's a 
little frustrating. But at the same 
time it's a good thing. It shows 
our team is playing well." 

Cal State Stanislaus played 
some defense of their own, only 
giving up 10 shots and one goal. 
The Tritons came in averaging 
nearly 17 shots and three goals 
per contest. 

"They played three in the back 
and dropped another to play with 
two sweepers," McManus said. 
"They're an aggressive team that 
was looking for a counterattack." 

However, with four defenders, 
five midfielders and only one for-
ward, Cal State Stanislaus never 
mounted an offensive threat. Also 
contributing to their offensive 
woes, Cal State Stanislaus was 
without all-conference second-
team midfielder Erin Taylor, who 
sat out the game with a knee

UCSD falls to No. 3 Pepperdine 
Hosting Waves oust men's water polo 9-4 

By MATTHEW GIANT 
Contributing Writer 

The o. 6 Triton men's water 
polo squad lost, 9-4, to o. 3 
Pepperdine in their first matchup 
this sea on on OCl. 12 at Malibu's 
Raleigh Runnels Memorial Pool. 

Less than one minute and 30 
seconds into the match, junior 
Jonathan Hopkins scored the only 
goal of the quarter for either side, 
pumng UCSD up with a confident 
1-0 lead. 

With a defense led by Junior 
KeYln Smoker' remarkable ability 
to prevent any fir~t-quarter goal 
from hole set, the Tmons tried to 
mamtalO their lead through the 
operung half. 

The Waves returned to the pool 
m the second quarter determined 
to destroy UCSD. In the operung 
five rrunute , Pepperdme put up 
four unanswered goals against the 
Tmon defense before seruor co-
capulO Man Ellis was finally able 
to reply With one at the 1:47 mark. 
UCSD went to the loder room at 
the half, suffering a 4-2 deficit. 

"Our strategy was good, we 
just couldn't contai n Jesse 
[S mlthl ," goalie Dave Miller 
ald . "We had some defensive 

breakdowns that lel him get 
open."

less ID the first half, but the naoon-
al team player managed to dupe the 
Triton defense for four of the 
Waves' five second-half goal . 

UCSD fans watched In horror 
as their team collapsed over the 
next two quarters. Juniors Steven 
Jendrusina and Travis Boettner 
each scored one m the third and 
forth, but the damage was 
irrepara ble. 

"Unfortunately, the game was 
too stagnant. We li"e to keep 
games at a fast tempo," junior dri-

ver Brandon Borso ald. "We're 
not a big team, so we try to win on 
endurance and speed. We needed 
to be counteranacking." 

But the counterattack was shut 
down. Whether by the defensive 
efforts of the Pepperdine squad or 
the hortcomings of the Triton 
offense, the job did not get done. 

"We had no effective counter-
anac"," Miller aid. "The first half 
counteranack was so slow that we 
were only having 13 or 15 seconds 
on the shot clock before we had to 
dump the balL" 

An effective counteranack 
would have nccessit2ted 20 or more 
seconds for a set offense to occur.

been subject to a rigorous schedule 
lately: a four-game tournament at

game of the season in a 2-1 win

Armstrong said. "We lilc.e our 
chances in overtime." 

In the see-saw battle again t 
the Wan-iors , neither team man-

and we were JUSt glad to get Out of 
there with a win," Armstrong said. 

Two nights later in Bakersfield, 
Calif., the Tritons notched 
another 2-1 victory in a playoff-
type atmosphere. The traditional -
ly trong Roadrunners, ranked 
fourth in the Far Wcst Region, 
took more shots on goal and 
earned more coring chances, but 
till couldn't knock off U SD, 

which is ranked No. 5 in the
