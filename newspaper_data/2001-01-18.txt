Flood Wreaks Havoc at Tioga Hall 
Muir students experience the effects of a faulty drainpipe 
If KYU .. lB ...... 
Staff Writer 

After days of pounding rain in last week's 
winter storms, UCSD is finally dry, with the 
exception of Tioga Hall. 

Last Thursday a small flood occurred on 
the ground floor of Muir college's Tioga Hall. 
Water quickly spread throughout the south 
side of the building in the early hours of the 
morning, prompting 17 residents to seek 
higher ground. 

Susan Rindlaub, a Muir freshman, awoke 
just after 8 a.m. only to find an inch and a half 
of water on the floor of her room. 

"' jumped out of bed in my socks and [the 
water] splashed up all around me," Rindlaub 
said. "My stuff was floating in my room." 

The source of the water was a leaky drain-
pipe that was supposed to divert precipita-
tion from the roof of the 11- story residence 
hall to the ground floor. However, a cap that 

was supposed to have sealed the pipe came 
loose, causing gallons of rainwater to pour 
into the common room between two adJoin-
ing suites. 

Campus officials became aware of the 
problem just after 8 a.m. and immediately 
advised affected residents to exit the building. 

Since then, workers have tried to dry the 
carpets using powerful fans. 

However, soggy carpets, a musty odor and 
the constant noise of electric fans forced sev-
eral of .the residents to seek temporary living 
quarters elsewhere. 

Consequently, the Muir Residential Life 
office offered several vacant rooms on the 
eighth floor to students wishing to relocate 
temporarily until conditions become once 
again suitable for living. 

"My parents got me a hotel room," 
Rindlaub said. "I thought that was a better

Patch Adams to 
Speak at Campus 
Commencement 
Ceremony affirmed by 
speaker confirmation 
By MATT SCHRADER 
Associate News Editor 

For the fourth time in school history, 
UCSD will have an all-campus com-
mencement now that Dr. Patch Adams has 
agreed to speak at the June 17 event. 

"Patch Adams represents more than a 
celebrity name," said A.S. President Doc 
Khaleghi, who worked to sign the speaker. 
"He represents using learned knowledge 
for the good of the community. I think that 
is very important for the graduating class 
at UCSD to remember that we are given 
knowledge, but with that knowledge 
comes responsibility for our fellow man." 

In addition to his strong character, 
many believe that Adams will be a good 
all-campus commencement speaker 
beca use of the messages he propagates. 

"Adams says how the futu re may be 
uncertain, but to keep up your positive 
spirits," said A.S. Co-Festivals Coordinator 
Scott Mantel who was also responsible for 
booking Adams. "I think it is a good mes-
sage for people entering the real world." 

Adams, the founder of the free medical 
care institute, the Gesundheit Institute in 
West Virginia, was the first individual 
given a serious offer to speak by Khaleghi 
and Mantell. 

Many seniors are excited over the sign-
ing, as it represents the chance to have an 
all-campus commencement and to hear a 
quality speaker with a solid message. 

"Having Patch Adams will not be as 
good as getting Bush: Muir senior Jan 
Tatala said. "But the opportunity to hear 
[Adams] speak will be exciting nonethe-
less." 

Of equal importance to many is the fact 
that Adams is known for fulfilling his 
obligation to speak. Khaleghi said this will 
end all possibility that the events of last 
year will be repeated, when Maya Angelou 
canceled her engagement to speak at the 
last minute. 

"Adams has a reputation for never can-
celing an . engagement: Khaleghi said .

ACIU Collage Bowl Comes to Challenge UCSD Students 
The all-campus toumaroent is scheduled to take place on campus Jan. 31 

Staff Writer 

The 2001 ACIU college bowl 
has arrived at UCSD. The annual 
event challen~es students with a 
knack for triVia to sign up within 
their college. 

The individua colleges' bowls 
take place this week and next 
week. The top two teams from 
each college will compete in the 
university-wide event Jan. 31 in 
the Price Center Theater. 

The winning team will then 
represent UCSD at the ACIU 
regional College Bowl tournament 

at Sacramento State Feb. 16 to Feb. 
18. The state winner wiU then try 
for the national title. 

Contestants in the tourna-
ments are asked questions from all 
realms of academia. Teams must 
be prepared to grapple with all 
areas, from the sciences and 
humanities to sports and enter-
tainment. 

Patricia Mahaffey, Muir's assis-
tant resident dean, enjoys the uni-
versity's celebration of the mind. 

Â·College Bowl is an event I look 
forward to every year, she said 
"The best and the brightest come 
out." 

Mahaffey also noted that many 
students come to watch both the 
individual college tournaments 
and the all-campus tournament. 

Although the Muir event was 
held on Wednesday night, there is 
still time to sign up to compete at 
the other colleges. 

Revelle college will hold its 
event Thursday. 

Warren and Marshall colleges 
are accepting sign-ups in their 
dean's offices. Roosevelt students 
can sign up in the Residential Life 
office. The Warren event will be 
held Jan. 22, followed by Marshall 
~ollege's the next day. 

Finally, Roosevelt will meet for 
its college bowl Jan. 24. Sign-ups 
are accepted individually or'as a 
team. Teams consist of four mem-
bers with an optional alternate. 
There is no cost to enter. 

UCSD marketing coordinator 
and College Bowl overseer Matt 
Xavier is expecting everyone to 
have a great time with the tourna-
ment. 

"The College Bowl is a lot of 
fun," Xavier said. "It tests peo-
ple 's intelligence and thei r abil ity

UCSD biologists discover 
clues In specie. dlver.ence 

UCSD biologists have used the songs and 
genetiCS of warblers in central Asia to show how 
one species can become two. 

The researchers believe this is the ' missing 
evidence" Darwin was unable to find in order to 
support his theory of natural selection. 

Darren E. Irwin, a biologist at UCSD, and his 
colleagues Trevor D. Price and Staffan Bensch 
published their results in the Jan. 18 Issue of the 
journal "Nature." 

The researchers studied various breeds of the 
warbler and saw a small variation in their song 
patterns, morphology and genetic markers that 
led them to see how the one species merged 
into two separate ones that did not even recog-
nize each others' songs. 

UC sign. contract to 
avoid rising enero cost. 

UC President Richard C. Atkinson announced 
Wednesday that the university has avoided mil-
lions of dol/ars In electriCity bills by signing a 
contract with the state Department of General 
Services. 

The university began protecting itself against 
the rising costs of natural gas in 1998 when it 
signed a similar contract with energy supplier 
Enron Corp. of Houston. 

That particular contract saved UCSD $12.3 
million during one eight month period. The UC 

'system is the largest energy consumer in 
California and the new contract is expected to 

save the university a similar amount of money. 

New electronic .......... to 
becoIne Bvallable to UC 

The California Digital Library recently 
announced it purchased two new databases 
from Alexander Street Press. These databases 
will be available next month on the California 
Digital Library, which is accessible to the nine 
UC campuses. 

The two full-text databases are ' North 
American Women's Letters and Diaries, ColonialÂ· 
1950' and ' The American Civil War: Letters and 
Diaries.' Both databases include about 100,000 
pages of published writings and 4,000 pages of 
previously unpublished writings. 

The California Digital Library was created in 
1997 and became accessible in 1999 to the UC 
system. COL includes the databases of 
Alex ander Street Press, a publisher of electron-
ic databases about SOCial Sciences and 
Humanities 'topics. COL's purpose is to provide 
electronic collections and educational informa-
tion to the UC schools. 

The two particular databases were acquired 
after a thorough selection process among facul-
ty, staff and librarians. 

The Women's Letters and Diaries database is 
the largest electronic collection of women's 
diary entries and correspondence ever put 
together. It was obtained from over 1,000 
sources, such as newsletters, pamphlets and 
conference proceedings. 

The contents of the writings will include 
records of the women's work conditions, what 
they ate and wore, their personal relationships, 
among other topics. There will be points of view 
from all various ethnicities, age groups and life 
styles. 

The other database, 'The American Civil 
War,' will include the writings of generals, 
slaves, politicians and other people, expressing 
their views about different aspects of war. The 
letters and diaries will include Northern and 
Southern points of view, as well as perspectives 
of foreigners. 

The Women's Diaries and American Civil War 
databases can be accessed through the COL 
Web sfte, http://www.cdllb.org. or the UCSD 
library Web site In the Social Sciences and 
Humanities Databases under 'New Databases 
and Trials, " projected to become accessible 
starting the third week of February.

Collegiate: 
Last year's survtry also 
showed and increase 
CuaIIro ............... l 
stimulant and hallucinogenic char-
acteristics. 

During the past year, the United 
States witnessed a large increase in 
the use of ecstasy among adoles-
cents, including a 2.6 percent 
increase in ecstasy use among high 
school seniors from 5.6 percent to 
8.2 percent, according to the 
Monitoring the future study per-
formed at the Institute for Social 
Research. 

Last year's survey also showed 
that one in 12 University of 
Michigan students had used ecsta-
'J'j at least once during the last year. 

During the course of the past 
few years, substance abuse thera-
pist Randy Pomeroy at the 
Chelsea Arbor Treatment Center 
said he has also seen a huge 
increase in the number of stu-
dents using ecstasy. He estimated 
that four out of his 14 young 
adult cases use ecstasy. 

Users and experts agree that the 
-biggest fear with ecstasy is the 

_ probability that the ecstasy is laced 
with ~ore dangerous drugs, which 
can produce fatal effects. 

Pomeroy said students worried 
about purity are in the minority. 
Most people are not as scared 
about the drug because it is 
becoming more common on col-
lege and university campuses, 
through gateway drugs including 
alcohol and marijuana, he 
explained. 

"In two, three or four years 
down the road, it's not likely that 
they will quit, because it is more 
socially acceptable: he said. 

According to the survey, 51 per-
cent of the 13,286 high school 
seniors who responded said they 

could get ecstasy "fairlyÂ· to "very 
easily: lind 38 percent of these stu-
dents saw a great risk in trying the 
drug. 

Johnston attributes the lack of 
concern to a "honeymoon period" 
for the drug, a time when people 
don 't realize the long-term conse-
quences, which include neurologi-
cal disorders, respiratory failure, 
anxiety and liver damage. Johnston 
compared this to the use of cocaine 
in the late '70s and early '80s, when 
users did not realize the serious 
side effects of the drug until later in 
the decade.

Domestic Abu .. 
Growilli Concern for 
CoIle.e ltudents 

MINNEAPOLIS - The num-
ber of college-age people reporting 
abuse seems to be on the rise, said 
Katie Bauman, PASV volunteer 
coordinator and database special-
ist, but that could be attributed to a 
larger number of people reporting 
it. 

Studies have long suggested 
that domestic abuse among 17- to 
24-year-olds is a reality. 

Twenty-eight percent of high 
school and college-age students are 
in abusive relationships, according 
to American Bar Association statis-
tics. 

Of the 11 0 women reportedly 
murdered in apparent domestic 
violence cases between 1995 and 
1999, 23 were 17- to 24-year olds, 
according to the Minnesota 
Coalition for Battered Women. 

But as the number of reponed 
domestic assaults on college cam-
puses and among coUege-age peo-
ple rise, most institutions have not 
concentrated many resources in 
that area.

relocation, with affected stu-
dents.

Questions are mailed to the col-

The format of the Bowl game is

with a general toss-up question 
open to response from both

player answers correctly, h is or her 
team will be given a bonus ques-
tion that only their team can

"Janitorial services tried their 
best to take care of this, but the 
administration's response has 
been less than overwhelming: 
Lobato said. 

Because the flood was not the 
fault of any of the residents, the 
Muir Residential Life office will 
work hard to compensate stu-
dents for damages incurred. This 
includes replacing ruined text-
books. soiled garments and pos-
sibly damaged computers. 

Additionally, drain pipes 
throughout Muir College were 
inspected by maintenance work-
ers in Tioga and Tenaya Hall so 
that further rain does not pose 
similar problems in the future. 

another toSS-up question is asked. 
Stanford University and the 

University of Southern California 
are consistent champions at the 
statewide regional event. These 
private schools actually offer 
courses aimed to prepare students 
for this event. 

UCSD teams are largely stu-
den t run, not professionally 
coached like teams of some other 
universities. 

However, UCSD has managed 
to perform with great deal of suc-
cess. Last year, a group from 
Revelle college came in third place 
in the regional contest.

Advertising Insert 
Controversial, Not a 
Public Disservice 

This issue of the Guardian contains an 
advel1ising insel1 that many on campus will 
see as controversiaL In the past, the 
Guardian has refused to run similar inserts 
from Human Life Alliance because they had 
the potential to give the Guardian a negative 
image on this campus. We expect, however, 
that our readers are intelligent enough to 
realize that the Guardian editorial staff does 
not produce these inserts, nor do we neces-
sarily agree with them, 

The Guardian on a regular basis receives 
money to have advertisements and small 
magazines insel1ed into our paper. When 
the Guardian runs insel1s from Yahoo! or 
Council Travel, it does not mean that the 
Guardian SUPPOI1S these companies or orga-
nizations. Similarly, being paid to run an 
insel1 from Human Life Alliance does not 
mean we endorse its opinions. 

Even though this insel1 is a booklet, it 
looks nothing like our publication, and 
should not be confused with anything we 
would produce. The insel1 is not printed on 
newsprint like our publication is; each page of 
the advertisement, including the cover, is 
clearly labeled "Advertising Supplement." 
There are no gruesome photos, and the name 
of the organization is printed on the cover. 

In addition, we realize that whether we 
agree or disagree with its opinions, this 
insert includes opinions that are part of a 
legitimate debate in society. Last year the 
Guardian staff voted against running an ad 
claiming the Holocaust never happened. We 
feel that an ad such as that does not repre-
sent an issue that is discussed or debated in 
society. 

On the other hand, the issue of abortion 
has divided this country for decades. To 
turn down this insert simply because we 
might disagree with it would set a precedent 
that would prevent us from running adver-
tisements from groups on the other side of 
this issue, 

In the past, the Guardian has run adver-
tisements from Planned Parenthood with-
out causing any controversy on this cam-' 
pus. This insert is not a public disservice; 
it is simply one that provides opinions 
from the other side of this contentious 
issue. 

The Guardian believes it is important to 
be fair, and we will not accept or decline 
advertisements based upon our own per-
sonal or political views.

Administration's Failure to Guarantee 
Housing Worries Apartment-Hunter 

Lack of space and an increase in enrollment will force housing administration 
to use a lottery system as a means of alleviating on-campus congestion 

By PAIINAZ TAHIIII 
Staff Writer 

As if entering a large university for the 
first time were not nerve-racking and 
torturous enough, the freshman class of 
2000 also faces the difficulty of finding 
housing next fall . The class is guaranteed 
housing on campus for only one year, as 
opposed to the traditional two years. 

With 2001 already in swing, there is 
only so much time for freshmen such as 
myself to find out where we are supposed 

Â·to live next year. Whether it be on cam-
pus, in an apartment 30 miles away from 
campus or - dare I say it - in a card-
board box, no freshman is sure of next 
year's living arrangement. . 

According to the housing administra-
tion, the reason fOT this unfortunate 
restriction is due to the fact that admis-
sion and enrollment at UCSD have 
increased, while available housing for 
this large number of students has 
decreased. 

Without space in the dormitories and 
apartments for all students, the adminis-
tration has been forced to subtract a 
guaranteed year of housing. [n fact, space 
has been so limited in the past year that 
three people are routinely put into two-
person rooms, which was the case with 
my apartment at Marshall college. 

Another reason for the loss of a two-
year . housing guarantee is that there 
would be no room to house the incom-
ing freshman class of 2001, which is also 
going to be guaranteed housing for just 
one year. 

The question .all the freshman are 
probably asking is, "How will it be deter-
mined who gets to live on campus and 
who doesn 't?" The answer is through 
the use of a lottery - luck of the draw-
the specifics of which are yet to be 
mapped out. 

According to the housing administra-
tion, those who have housing this year 
will most likely have a place to live on 

campus next year, but the possibility of 
being denied a space remains. [n other 
words, where some freshmen live next 
year is pretty. much up in the air. 

With all due respect, it seems that this 
housing fiasco is more of a problem than 
anyone wants to acknowledge or believe. 
While it may be true that most of the 
currently housed students would get a 
chance to live on campus again, there are 
also those poor souls who are going to 
have to find somewhere else to live. And 

If thi UCSD admissions is 
planning to take an excess of 
students into the universiry, 
then it should also. provide 
them with a place to live on 
campus for a minimum of 
two years. It is the 
responsibiliry of admissions 
and ho1!Sing to collaborate 
and guarantee housing .... 
in case anyone has forgotten, this is the 
community of La Jolla, where apartments 
don't exactly come as cheaply as what a 
starving college student can afford. 

Frankly, if UCSD admissions is plan-
ning to take an excess of students into 
the university, then it should also provide 
them with a place to live on campus for a 
minimum of two years. It is the responsi-
bility of admissions and housing to col-
laborate and guarantee housing to stu-
dents for their freshman and sophomore 
years. 

[f space is limited, then it is time to 
consider solutions other than a random 
lottery. For instance, why not just limit 
the number of freshmen admitted every 
year, or build new dorms and apartments 

as fast as the parking structures are being 
built? 

( don't know about anyone else, but [ 
still have trouble finding my way around 
campus, and [ live here. One more year 
on campus would help me familiarize 
myself with the campus completely. It 
would also be a way for me to save the 
money I would otherwise spend on an 
off-campus apartment and its necessities, 
such as fu rniture and gas and electric 
bills. As a freshman, [ would want the 
security and satisfaction of knowing that 
[ would have a place on campus next 
year. 

There remains the issue of picking 
people for housing spaces through this 
so-called lottery drawing. [t would be 
completely unfair for some to get lucky 
and receive housing, and for the misfor-
tunate others to get screwed over and be 
kicked out of the chance for on-campus . 
housing. Because most of us pay the 
~ame amount in tuition, excepting those 
with fi nancial aid or scholarships, 
shouldn't we all be entitled to the same 
chahce for housing? 

Freshmen wi ll rea lly worry about 
where they are going to live next year. 
With such limited space, it is impossible 
for all current freshmen to be housed for 
another year, but a lottery is not exactly a 
fair and negotiatable way to. decide who 
should live on campus. 

While the housing administration 
may seem to have everything under 
control, it won't be long before the 
complaints and worries kick in. [ know I 
am already starting to stress out about 
my possible living situation as a sopho-
more. With space so limited and admis-
sions so high, who knows if even first-
year housing will be guaranteed in the 
future? 

With the complex and mind-~Iing 
situation at hand, and with air our 
futures at stake, there is only one more 
thing to say to the freshman class: Let 
the apartment hunting begin!

My Wish for 2001: A Year of Political Unity 
Bickering parties need to work together to create change 

Speak Up, 
Speak Out! 

I actually have a very simple 
wish list for the 2001 year, for it 
involves only one request.Not that 
I expect to get what I ask for, but 
nonetheless I'm putting it out for 
the world to see. 

All I ask for is political unity. 
For I have become so sick of 
watching political divisiveness tear 
our country apart. Alii have to do 
is flip on the TV or open a news-
paper to see that politics as usual 
continues in Washington, full 
steam ahead without taking into 
account the terrible toll it is taking 
on the people. 

. There is so much focus on 
Democrats or Republicans that a 
wide chasm has formed between 
the ~o panies, and it is almost 
impossible to breach. It is this 
hostile political climate that acts 
to suppress needed reform and 
keeps the current gridlock finnly 
in place. Politics as usual in Wash-
ington equals no change. 

Take a look. The past election 
is a perfect example. The Democ-
ra ts' bitterness over losing the 

election has put them on the 
warpath, which in turn has put the 
Republicans on the defensive. 

Mark my words, no real reform 
will take place over the next four 
years. If the past couple months 
have been any indicator, the 
Democrats and Republicans will 
not budge from their all-holy 
party line. 

Instead, controversy, attacks 

The issues of reforming 
education, healthcare, 
and social securiry .. . can 
onry be solved when a 
spirit of political uniry 
is formed. A spirit of 
bipartisanship tha~ 
transcends party lines 
must be created. 
and chaos will rule the next four 
years. I don't mean to be a cynic, 
really I don't, but I'm just telling 
you what I know will happen 
based on what has already hap-
pened. Or better yet, based on the 
lack of anything happening. 

This unhealthy obsession with 
partisanship and conflict merely 
enforce.s the current status quo in 

which nothing is being done to fIX 
our society's problems. 

Picture this: Our country is 
drowning with so many unfixed 
problems, yet our political parties 
won't stop their bickering and 
personal attacks long enough to 
throw out a life preserver. It's a 
pathetic but true picture. 

The issues of reforming edu-
cation, healthcare and social secu-
rity, for example, can only be 
solved when a spirit of political 
unity is formed. A spirit of bipar-
tisanship that transcends party 
lines must be created. 

So my solution: Political par-
ties must go. And in their place 
we must bring back the ideals of 
civility, respect, compromise and 
decency that our country was 
originally founded upon. 

There was a time when there 
were no political parties to divide 
us and alienate one another. (t 
was the time of Washington's 
Presidency. When President 
Washington left office he warned 
against fonning political parties as 
they would divide us and under-
mine the common good. Yet we 
did not heed his warning, instead 
we focused on our individual 
interests and steamrolled to where 
we are today.

Ashcroft Pledges to Enforce All Laws, 
Even Those He Opposes 

WASHINGTON - On the 
opening day of Senate confirma-
tion hearings to be attorney gen-
eral, John Ashcroft said Tuesday 
that he would enforce all of the 
country's laws - even those he 
disagreed with, including laws 
that support a woman 's constitu-
tional right to an abortion. 

Ashcroft spoke as the Senate 
Judiciary Committee seemed 
badly frayed along party lines, 
with several senators harshly 
questioning their former col-
league about whether his conser-
vative views would influence his 
actiQ)1s .at the Justice Department 

-on civil rights and other ~ocial 
issues, 

Ashcroft, who until last month 
was a senator from Missouri and a 
member of the judiciary panel, 
seemed determined to lower the 
volume of the debate on his can-
didacy. "I understand that being 
attorney general means enforcing 
the laws as they are written, not 
enforcing my personal prefer-
ences: Ashcroft told the commit-
tee. "It means advancing the 
national interest, not advocating 
my J'er5'?nal interest.Â· 

Republicans on the committee 
praised Ashcroft, saying that his 
experience as a two-term state 
attorney general, a two-term 
governor and a U.S. senator made 
him one of the most highly qua[i-
fied candidates ever selected to be 

attorney general. 
But Democrats made it plain 

that they were skeptical about 
whether Ashcroft was an appro-

. priate choice to ' lead the Justice 
Department. 

Sen. Patrick Leahy, 0-Vt., said 
that when Ashcroft was a senator, 
he voted apinst some Clinton 
administration nominees with 
whose opinions he took issue, 
even though they also said they 
would enforce the laws. 

Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, 0-
Mass., was more openly combat-
ive, raising his voice and charging 
that Ashcroft had deliberately 
obstructed voluntary desegrega-
tion plans in St. Louis in the 

19705. 
Ashcroft denied that he had 

opposed integrating the schools, 
and seemed stunned by the feroc- â¢ 
ity of the questioning. At one 
point, he asked for more time to 
respond, saying. "When the 
machine gun comes out, I want to 
respond to all of the lead." 

The hearings, which ended 
Tuesday after five hours of testi-
mony, are to resume on 
Wednesday and Thursday with 
additional testimony from 
Ashcroft's supporters and critics.

Clinton Seeks to Keep For.i~ From 
Hiding Wealth in United States 

WASHINGTON The 
Clinton administration plans to 
announce new measures that 
banks may take to deter foreign 
leaders and their associates from 
hiding money in the United 
States, a leading destination for 
iIIidt wealth. 

The voluntary guidelines, to be 
announced Tuesday, are the result 
of a compromise between leading 
banks and law enforcement offi-
cials, whose disagreements in 
recent weeks nearly derailed the 
administration's final anti-
money-laundering initiative. 

American authorities hope the 
steps will help deter corruption in 
developing nations because politi-
cal leaders will find it harder to 
channel illicit wealth into ordinary 
investments. Regulators will sug-
gest that banks and brokerage 
houses adopt voluntary but

Operator, said that without emer-
gency federal authority granted 
earlier and a hectic search for new 
power sources planned blackouts 
would have been unavoidable. 

Detmers added that the orga-
nization had prepared plans to 
make up for the shortfall in power 
if Southern California Edison 
filed for bankruptcy, as it had 
been warning it might be forced 
to do. 

Two events Tuesday made the 
fragile situation in the energy sys-
tem even worse. First, the loss of 
several large generating facilities

guards. The official in Brussels, 
Louis Michel, saia he had received 
confirmation of Kabila's death 
from "two trustworthy sources." 
The circumstances of the shooting 
were not immediately known, but 
one report said that it had involved 
a dispute between Kabila and some 
of his generals, 

The Congolese government 
gave no details of the incident, but 
announced that it had sealed the 
country's borders, closed the air-
port and imposed a nighttime cur-
few, A televised address by Kabila's 
personal chief of staff, Col. Edy 
Kapend, suggested the seriousness 
of the events. Soldiers surrounded 
the presidential palace, according 
to reports from Kinshasa, but the 
capital itself appeared calm. 

Ordering senior commanders to 
bring their units under control, 
Kapend said: "No shots may be 
fired, for whatever reason, without 
prior order. The population must 
not be thrown into panic and the 
troops must not grow agitated: 

The government's minister of 
interior, Gaetan Kakudji , one of 
Kabila's closest allies, went on state 
television to say that the president 

NEWS 7 

forced the organization that over-
sees the power grid to declare an 
emergency - a so-called Stage 3 
alert - and use special state and 
federal powers to force some gen-
erating companies to provide 
power, 

An official of the system oper-
ator said that without those emer-
gency powers the state would 
have had to order planned black-
outs for an hour or so at a time of 
huge swaths of customers, block 
by block across California. 

Second, the rating agencies in 
New York finally downgraded the 
ratings of the state's two largest 
utilities, Southern California 
Edison and Pacific Gas and 
Electric, to one of their lowest lev-
els. The step pushed the bonds of 
the two huge companies below 
investment grade, or into the sta-
tus of junk bonds. 

Adding to the sudden down-
ward spiral in the financial condi-
tion of the utilities, Southern 
California Edison filed documents 
with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission saying that that it 
was suspending $596 million in 
payments to creditors, including 
payments it owed some power 
producers.

himself had ordered the curfew, 
suggesting that he was still alive. 

But in Washington, a senior 
administration official said the 
United States has received several 
reports from credible sources that 
Kabila had been assassinated. "Our 
operating assumption is that he is 
dead," the official said, 

If the assumption is confirmed, 
Kabila's death would dramatically 
alter the dYAamics of a 2 112 year 
old war that has drawn in half a 
dozen African nations and destabi-
lized all of Central Africa. Kabi[a, 
who deposed the longtime dictator 
Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997, had 
long been considered the main 
obstacle to any diplomatic resolu-
tion to the current conflict, and 
had become increasingly isolated 
diplomatically during his four years 
in office. 

[t was not clear Tuesday night 
who might have led the coup 
against Kabila, though his standing 
in the military had fallen recently. 
After months of a military stale-
mate, during which all the warring 
parties had seemed satisfied with 
carving up the Congo and feasting 
on its natural resources, Kabila's 
forces suffered a serious defeat late 
last year in the southeast, in the 
mineral- rich province of Katallga,

Pakistani Rebels Attack Airport in Disput8d Kashmir Region 
NEW DELHI, India - A daring 

attack on the airport at Srinagar in 
Kashmir left at least 11 people dead 
Tuesday afternoon, including six 
militants who stormed the heavily 
guarded facility with grenades and 
automatic weapons, the authorities 
said, 

The Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-
Toiba, one of several militant 
groups waging a guerrilla war 
against Indian rule in the embattled 
Himalayan region, claimed respon-
sibility for the raid, which was yet 
another blow to a nascent peace 
process, 

In recent weeks, as Indian forces 

have temporarily suspended coun-
terinsurgency operations, distrust-
ful militant groups have responded 
wit~ a series of high-profile 
assaults, among them an attack on 
the historic Red Fort in the heart of 
the nation'S capital. 

The gun banle Tuesday began 
when guerrillas - dressed in the 
regulation camouflage of the Indian 
paramilitary - arrived at a security 
cordon outside the airport, where 
outgoing passengers first have their 
baggage screened and searched. 

The intruders opened fire on 
the federal police staffing the 
checkpoint, the authorities said. A 

long shootout that the police said 
lasted more than an hour spilled 
over into two shops near the air-
port's entrance. 

Killed along with the six mili-
tants were three police officers, a 
banker and a teenage girl. At least 
11 other people were injured, the 
authorities said. 

The incident now becomes part 
of the confusing interplay between 
India .and Pakistan, the two protag-
onists in the 53-year-old custody 
battle over Kashmir. 
â¢ Both nations have recently 
made gestures toward the start of 
serious talks. On Monday, 

Pakistan 's military ruler, Gen . 
Pervez Musharraf, received a cour-
tesy call from the Indian high com-
missioner in [slamabad. The meet-
ing lasted almost an hour, Wishes 
were conveyed by both sides for a 
resumption of dialogue, 

But Pakistan continues to sup-
port the militant groups fighting 
inside the Indian state of Jammu 
and Kashmir. That support, India 
alleges, includes arms, money and 
marching orders, 

Indian intelligence sources said 
on Tuesday that the guerrillas' 
activities have shown no "meaning-
ful drop-off" since their side 

declared a cease-fire in late 
November. 

Those attacks by the militant 
groups threaten to render stillborn 
any peace efforts. India 's home min-
ister LX Advani said on Monday 
that the government was about to 
review the cease-fire in view of the 
inadequate reciprocation, 

"If such activities go on, then we 
will have to see how and in what 
manner the peace initiative by 
Prime Minister Atal Behari 

. Vajpayee will continue: he said,

This fact is all the more important this 

year, as the administration was close to 
canceling all-campus commencement per-
manently if no speaker suitable to the stu-
dents and the administration alike could

Students had expressed concern over

Currently, two individual college com-

followed by the all-campus commence-
ment on RIMAC field in the early after-
noon, and the remaining three college 
commencements after that. 

Moreover, the A.S. Council has stated 
that its involvement with this day has not 
ended now that it has signed a speaker. 

"We will play an active role in all 
aspects of planrring so that the all-campus

Â·MThis commencement 

represents a turning point 
A.S. Council President 

for UCSD,w Khaleghi said. MFor the first 
time ever, tentatively, all six commence-
ments will be on the same day. Rather 
than the university taking away from the 
colleges, or vice-versa, the two will 
enhance each other. This will promote 
college strength while bolstering campus 
unity: 

In addition to unity, Mantell said that 
the advent of all-campus commencement 
will be good because it will give those who 
do not associate with their individual col-
lege a chance to be recognized and be a 
part of a larger ceremony. 

"I think it is important because a lot of 
students aren't connected to their college 
or they are transfer students who were 
never placed within a college: he said. 
MThese students were always UCSD stu-
dents versus a Marshall or Warren one. 
This is an opportunity for all students on 

commencement will be a 
success and therefore here to stay.w 

Regardless, Mantell said finding a 
speaker this year was difficult due to cer-
tain disadvantages about the school. 

"It was a pretty difficult process,w he 
said. "Many speakers will only go to their 
alma mater or a place they have a strong 
connection to. We [don 't have that 
because] we are a really young university: 

In addition, this represents only the 
fourth time that this school has had an all-
campus commencement. The process of 
finding a speaker is new to the school. 

Mantell said finding a speaker was 
urgent as well because all the colleges gave 
very early deadlines as to when they must 
be notified that there was going to be an 
all-campus commencement. 

Many believe this success will stem 
from Adams' use of comedy and humor in 
his speeches and his everyday life.

Hotels: 
Las Vegas offers more 
than just decadence 
Continued from page 10 
any other city in the world. 

Over the last d~cade Las Vegas 
has slowly been shedding its 
image of complete decadence. 
Although it is probably still quite 
easy to be sinful in this city, Vegas 
has started to create this image of 
being more accessible to a wide 
range of people of all ages. 

Vegas has bloomed into a city 
of ent rancing I.ights, wonderful 
sigh ts, and it shows off capitalist 
might. The strip, or Las Vegas 
Boulevard , is lined with beautiful 
new hotel-casinos with shopping 
malls located right inside along 
with art exhibits, quaint coffee 
shops and many different perfor-
mances. 

Here are some of the hotel-
casinos that line the strip and 
some things to do besides gamble 
away your savings.

ful and praised resort on the strip.

visually appealing shows on the 
strip. It is also free. Dozens of 
high-powered fountains are gor-
geously choreographed with lights

Lionel Richie and Andrea Bocelli. 

If you have about $90 to burn, 
you call watch "0Â· by Cirque Du 
Solei!. which uses 1.5 million gal-
lons of wata as its stage. The Bel-
laglo Conservatory IS an amazing 
co llec tion of fresh flowers and 
trees that changes wi th the holi-
days and seasons. The Bellagio 
Gallery of Fine Art rotates exhibits 
on d quarterly baSIS. The current 
visiting exhibit displays paintings 
from Picasso, Monet, Degas, 
Ceza nne and Van Gogh.

What do you do when you lose

Aimee Mann is concerned, you 
express your disapproval at live 
shows and playa kick-ass set that 
proves that the judges were either 
incompetent or 

yet comical comments that 
Phillips made throughout the 
night. 

Aside from the jolr.es. his perfor-
mance consisted of deep, 
metaphorical lyrics sung to ~utiÂ­
fully elaborate chord progrusions. 
His folk-blues set included songs 
from his recent album "Mighty Joe 
Moon."

Mann's Dec. 13 

stop at the Sun 
Theater in Ana-

on her tour pro-
moting her third 
solo album, "Bach-

which she received

nations. However,

disappraval at live 
shows and play a 
kick-ass set that 
proves that the 
judges were either 
incompetent or deaf 

The transition 
from Phillips to 
Mann encom-
passed a change 
from acoustic to 
electric guitar: Her 
set list ranged from 
heart-wrenching, 
slow ballads such 
as "4th of JulyÂ· and 
"Wise Up" to 
upbeat tune like 
"Ghost World," 

'The show's high-
lights included an 
amazing acoustic 
rendition of "It's 
Not Safe,Â· with vio-
lins fusing in after 

lost to a song about "T~ and a 
cartoon monkey. That's kind of 
how I ftcl about the election right 
now." 

Playing to an audience of most-
ly middle-aged people. Mann's 13-
song set included work from her 
solo albums "WhateverÂ· (1993), 
"I'm With StupidÂ· (1995) and 
"Bachelor .r (2000). It also 
included songs from the "Magno-
Iiaw soundtrack (2000), which made 
her music known to a mainstream 
audience. 

Grant Lee Phillips was the 
opening act that night, playing a 
fairly long 11-song all-acoustic 
guitar set. "You guys might be 
able to rent 'Magnolia,' and by the 
time it's finished, I'll be done,Â· he 
joked at the beginning of the set. 
This remark was one of many odd 

the first verse. 
After the song, Mann joked 

about the despondent nature of her 
music and sarcastically declared, 
"That was my all-purpose protest 
song with my usual message, which 
is 'Give up - it's hopeless!'Â· 

Other highlights included the 
energetic classic "Choice in the 
Matter,Â· the emotionally charged 
"SusanÂ· and the desperate and vul-
nerable "Long Shot." 

The night ended with two 
encores, the last of which was a 
moving, acoustic version of "I've 
Had It.w Mann left the stage gra-
ciously thanking the audience 
while the crowd cheered earnestly, 
affirming Mann's position as a 
great performer and one of the 
more prolific songwriters of our 
time. .

range from $59 to $399. The 
Monte Carlo is located toward the

WJ:iAT TO DO: World-famous 
magician Lance Burton performs 
two shows nightly between Tues-
day and Saturday in a 1,200-seat 

by a former professional baseball 
player sounds like, then this is it. 
"Pieces of the PastW is by former 
baseball player and current coach 
of the San Diego Padres Tim Flan-
nery. 

Flannery's debut album is a mix 
~ oUolk and bluegrass and it com-

bines acoustic guitar, fiddle and 
bagpipe, among other instruments, 
to create an old-country sound. 
The instrumental music on this 
album is well-crafted and intricate-
ly layered with lots of harmonizing 
effects, but overall, it evokes little 
emotion because of Flannery's 
insipid lyrics and droning voice. 

"Foot of the Crossw is a stan-
dard Christian song, with such 
overused lyrics like "At the foot of 
the cross love will be found ... 
there's a place I go to when life gets 
me down.w Perhaps the song would 
sound better if sung by someone 

theatre. A massive 21,000-square 
foot pool includes waterfalls and a 
wave pool. Monte Carlo also 
offers a wide range of shops.

DESCRIPTION: Ballys is the

Buffet, to satisfy r,our appetite.

with a more expressive: voice, but it 
sounds disappointingly tedious 
with Flannery's average set of 
pipes. 

"Million Miles Away,Â· however, 
is a soothing six-minute song 
inspired by IIlqncsome walk on the 
streets of San t:rancisco. 

Flannery writes his own songs 
and explains them in the liner 
notes. That fact shows promise. 
Flannery also employs standard 
instruments (acoustic guitar, bass, 
percussion, etc.), instead of imitat-
ing other kinds of music. 

"Pieces of the PastW successfully 
does what Flannery probably 
intended to do, which is to evoke 
images of nature and tell the stories 
of his childhood- but whether he 
suceeds in provoking any sort of 
interest from the listeners is anoth-
er story.

Make the 
mDE 8yRANDY UI Staff Writer 

With Microsoft under the 
watchful eye of the Department of 
Justice and on the verge of bemg 
split apart, I could imagine Chair-
man Bill Gates could use some 
cheering up. 

Sorry, Bill. Looks like Holly-
wood is also going to take a gU!-
wrenching stab at your life in its 
"tell-all" movie, "Antitrust." 
Although a better title would have 
been "Bill Gates is a Flesh-Eating 
Monster." 

People may argue that this 
movie is not at all related to 
Microsoft or its founder. But there 
are, after all, references to Emperor 
Gates in the movie as a competitor 
to the film 's fictitious, world-
encompassing corporation known 
as NURV (Never Underestimate 
Radical Vision). 

NURV's head honcho is the 
geeky Gary Winston (Tim ~obÂ­
bins), with bigger- than-your-wmd-
shield glasses, mousy hair ~nd a 
timid pasture. It's obvious Wmston 
was modeled after Gates. 

Director Peter Howitt shows 
us the world of software produc-
tion as a stereotypical society of 
dorks, loners and sociopaths. Pro-
grammers revel in orgasmic 
delight in fixing program bugs, 
sporting high-fives and rooting to 
"show some kind of creativity" 
that Winston demands of his sol-

diers. This describes the NURV 
campus as genius progr~",lmer 
Milo Hoffman (Ryan Phtlllppe) 
snuggles into his cushy new job 
with personal assistance from 
Winston himself. 

Financial success, a beautiful 
girlfriend (Claire Forlani) and a 
Mercedes-Benz are all Milo could 
ask for before he begins to suspect 
NURV's business and research 
tactics. Soon the film accelerates 
into conspiracy and murder, leav-
ing us with little time to catch our 
breath. Phillippe performs 
admirably when he confronts 
nothing but paranoia and mistrust, 
which often bUil.ds into scenes of 
rapid tension and sneaking suspi-
cion. 

Though the film thrills and 
electrifies, it later crashes faster 
than Windows 2000 running more 
than four programs, as the action 
becomes repetitive and a bit too 
melodramatic. 

The megalomaniac Winston 
becomes more tyrannical by the 
minute and his secrets are too far-
fetched and his plans for world 
domination would make him more 
at home against James Bond rather 
than Milo the programmer. 

Nonetheless, "Anritrust" is a 
fast-paced ride through the inside 
of Hollywood's view of the com-
pany we all love to hate. If Ga!)' 
Winston is supposed to be Btll 
Gates, then Gates is certainly the 
devi l.

Women Drop Two During Tough Road-Trip 
The Tritons look forward to coming home after losing to Cal Poly and San Bernardino 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

After a strong beginning to 
the season, the UCSD women's 
basketball team has been on a 
downturn of late. 

This theme continued last 
weekend as the Tritons lost two 
games on the road. UCSD was 
defeated by Cal Poly Pomona 
93-76 on Friday and also lost to 
CSU San Bernardino 56-51 on 
Saturday. 

San Bernardino controlled the 
first half and boasted a 30-23 lead 
heading into the break. 

UCSD made a run during the 
second half. The Tritons 
outscored their opponents in the 
'second half but still came up 
short where it really counted, los-
ing the game 56-51 . 

"We came out flat: Malone 
said. "At the end, we had a chance 
to win it, but they made their free 
throws." 

Friday, the Tri-
tons faced a large 
task as their oppo-
nents, the Cal Poly 
Broncos, are 
ranked first overall 
in the California 
Collegiate Athletic 
Association . 

UCSD started 
out stro ng and 
looked as if they 
would run away 
with the upset vic-

"We're learning. 
Division II is a 
different animal. 
They're very

ing scorer, was 
the only UCSD 
player to score

with 13 points

points, 36-23, 
with 5:57 remain-
ing in the first half. The Bron-
cos made a run, though, and 
narrowed the game to 46-42 by 
the break. 

The Tritons never got any-
thing going in the second half. 
Three of their players, including 
two starters, suffered with three 
fouls a piece heading into the 
tinal period. 

"We stopped handling their 
pressure: said Triton head coach 
Judy Malone. "We got into foul 
trouble. When you get into foul 
trouble, you don't defend as well . 
They pressed the whole game." 

Cal Poly, too, had trouble, but 
their young but deep bench 
helped them out of the monass. 

It was all Broncos in the sec-
nd half. Up 65-63, the home 

team rambled off a 20-2 run and 
never looked back. 

Triton star Maya Fok lead her 
team with 14 pints, four ass ists 
and three steals. Ali Ginn scored 
14. :'\icholle Brom ley added 12

The Tritons record has 

dropped as of late, falling to 7-6 
overall and 3-5 in CCAA compe-
tition . 

"We're learning," Malone said. 
"Division II is a different animal. 
They're very athletic, quick. It's a 
very physical league. We need to 
get more physical." 

The Tritons hope to rebound 
this weekend, when they play 
their first home games since 
classes resumed for winter quar-
ter. They did have a large tourna-
ment at the end of December, but 
fellow Tritons were still in the 
thralls of their hard earned winter 
break. 

"It's big," Malone said. "We're 
lucky to have this record after all 
the games on the road. We're 
happy to be at home." 

On Friday, UCSD hosts Cali-
fo rnia State University Los Ange-
les at 8 p.m. This will be the first 
of two games against Los Angeles, 
with the second coming on the 
road at the end February. 

On Saturday, CSU 
Dominguez Hills pays a visit for a 
6 p.m. game. Dominguez will also 
feel the Tritons' wrath during a 
game in February.

The UCSD sailing team is

high note. 

Wid\ the completion of ~.

is to improve on its 10th place 
sbowing in the Pacific: Coest

pitting different crew members

to face Davis. After talking to 
Malone, Fok decided to play for 
UCSD and hasn 't looked back 
since. 

"I feel a lot more comfortable 
here." she said. "The people on 
the team are great and it's just a 
lot more fun." 

In turn , Fok delivers to 
UCSD experience playing at the 
Division (( level and terrific ball-
handling skills which doesn 't 
have Coach Malone missing last 
year's point guard, who went to 
Japan. 

"(Fok brings) confidence and a 
very competitive attitude: MaI-
one said. "S he also has the mental 
toughness necessary for her lead-
ersh ip role." 

"I love pressure: Fok said. 
"Crunch time is the best part 
about playing. When you can pull 
it off under pressure, it's the 
greatest feeling in the world. 

"I really don't care if I don't 
score. Getting an assist on the 
game-winning shot is my 
dream." 

Unfortunately, her game-win-
ning shot in UCSD's season

UCSD had only one player in 
double-digit scoring; Erik Ramp 
scored 15 points in the game. 

San Bernardino was guided by 
Michael Edwards with 13 and 

Nazarene with 0.8 seconds left, 
and her clinching free throws in 
the 21st Annual UCSD Double-
tree Invitational Championship 
game have left her short of her 
dream. 

What's Fok's secret for dealing 
with pressure? 

"I talk to myself a lot." she 
laughed. 

Despite her eccentricities (or 
perhaps because of them), Fok 
and her teammates have quickly 
bonded and come to rely upon 
each other. 

"I just want to go all out for 
(the team]," she said. "Especially 
the seniors, I admire them so 
much. I want to cherish every sec-
ond I have with them and make 
the best out of this year." 

To do that, according to Fok, 
the team needs to work on per-
fecting the mental aspect of the 
game. 

"It's not an issue of heart ." 
she said. "We have to be mental-
ly prepared and gain some con-
sistency. And gain confidence. I 
want them to be as confident in 
me as I am in them. Once we 
play to our potential, I know we 
can beat anybody in our confer-
ence." 

With the ball resting in the 
capable hands of Maya Fok, the 
last thing she should have to 
worry about is her team's confi-
dence. 

Chris Mattice with 12. 
"They're just head and shoul-

ders above the rest of the confer-
ence,n Lanthier said. "There's a 
difference between losing to San 
Bernardino and Cal Poly." 

UCSD's record fell to 2-11 
overall and 1-7 in CCM play with 
the weekend's losses. 

The Tritons hope to get back 
on the winning side of things this 
weekend as they play their first

T here I sat, surrounded by drooling yokels and corn-fed half-breeds. They had 
crawled out of every back-

woods barn and hillside shanty to 
pack the seats of San Diego's Qual-
comm Stadium. 

The sickening stench of 
exhaust wafted up from the track 
below, mixing with the audience's 
putrid nacho cheese breath and 
body odor - so foul that it could 
only emanate from the dirtiest of 
unwashed heathens. So there I 
was huddled, shivering in my seat 
in Qualcomm's frosty night air, 
wondering why I was among 
them. 

Ah , yes, the race. Below me the 
mud-caked bikes boisterously 
made their way around the track 
for the umpteenth time, while the 
60,000 or so other moto-enthusi-
asts cheered wildly. For me, it was 
more like watching a friend play 
the classic Nintendo game Excite-
bike, except without the excite-
ment. 

So instead I concentrated on 
the contents of my 20-ounce 
plastic cup, which , contrary to 
what the price I paid might indi-
ca te, was filled with neither liquid 
gold nor rare Pokemon' cards. 
Alas, it was but domestic beer, but 
I greedily gulped it down, if to do 
nothing more than combat the 
rising nausea brought on by the 
fumes now permeating the stadi-
um's every nook and cranny. 

What is it that had these yahoos 
on the edge of their seats, eyeballs 
bulging as yet another lap began? 
Clearly, these people are of a differ-
ent stripe. 

One need look no further than 
the Q 's parking lot to realize that, 
as it was stacked sky-high with 
gleaming monuments of mechani-
cal carriage. It was a veritable smor-
gasbord of automobile excess, with 
monster trucks rising three stories 
high, and it was stocked with 
motors that appeared (and sound-
ed) capable of running a 757 jet or 
one of California's belabored 
"power" plants. 

A look at the bumper stickers 
adorning the beasts gave a more 
extensive glimpse into the mind of 
a race fan . For the most part they 
bore witty, urbane slogans such as, 
"Save a Mouse, Eat a Pussy," or 
"Got Ass?: which I hope is a play 
on the popular milk campaign and 
not an anatomical inquiry. 

I knew I was out of my element 
as soon as I entered the lot. As the 
rest of the race patrons revved their 
engines and offroaded over the 
metal barriers, I slinked on in with 
my friends, packed six deep in an 
Oldsmobile sedan with a rust-rid-
den roof. 

Ours was such a manly rig that 
it was actually dwarfed by the tires 
of many of the passing cars and 
trucks. The gear-heads scoffed at 
our impotent little set of wheels as 
they passed in a roar of exhaust, 
yelling such derisive, stinging 
insults as, "Hey Mario Andretti, see

PORTS 
Road Unkind to Tritons 
The Triton basketball team comes home empty-handed 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

The UCS D men's basketball 
team seems to have gotten off on 
the wrong foot this season, and 
that trend continued on the road 
this past weekend. The Tritons' 
losses were in the double digits 
during both weekend games. At 
California Polytechnic University 
at Pomona, UCSD came up short 
91-67. At California State Univer-
sity, San Bernardino, the Tritons 
fell again, this time 75-52. 

The Tritons knew going in 
that they weren't going to have an 
easy time against ei ther squad, as 
both are tied for first place in the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Associa tion . 

The Tritons were not playing 
half bad against Cal Poly, leading 
19-13 with 10 minutes remaining 
in the first half. 

Then, Broncos star Lucas 
Lecour went on a tear, scoring 10 
points in a row. He finished the 
first half with 18 points and led all 
scorers with 24 points for the 
game. . 

The second half was more of 
the same as Cal Poly cruised to a 
91-67 victory. 

UCSD has been deadly from 
three-point land this season, but 

it was Cal Poly this time around 
that was deadly from long range. 
The Tritons were only 10-26 
from beyond the arc, a .385 
shooting percentage. Cal Poly on 
the other hand was unconscious 
from downtown, hitting 8 out of 
16. 

Cal Poly was also successful at 
the foul line, making 25-28 from 
the charity stripe. 

Nick Christensen lead UCSD 
with 13 points and Clark Goolsby 
chipped in with 11 . 

For Lecour's effort, he was 
named the Rawlings CCAA 
Men's Basketball Player of the 
Week. 

"We're good for stretches, but 
we're not competitive fo r 40 min-
utes: said Triton head coach 
Greg Lanthier. "We're too 
young." 

The story remained the same 
after a trip down the freeway to 
San Bernardino. 

The lritons fell way behind in 
the first half, looking. at a 35-19 
deficit heading into the break. 
UCSD made somewhat of a run 
in the second half, being only 
outscored by seven in that period. 
San Bernardino was just too 
skilled, winning 75-52.

Triton Star Finds Fun and Friends at UCSD 
After getting kicked off the UC Davis team, Fok seeks revenge with UCSD 
By ISAAC PIAIILMAN 
Staff Writer 

All right, pop quiz: what do 
visualization, confidence, practice, 
and McDonald's food all have in 
common? Give up? Well, they are 
all parts of UCSD point guard 
Maya Fok's pregame ritual, of 
course. 

"I have McDonald's before 
every game" Fok laughed. 

Just don't tell the opposing 
coaches, or they might start wav-
ing fries at her on the court a la 
Grant Hill in those McDonald's 
commercials. 

Whatever Fok's routine con-
sists of, it appears to be working. 
She is among the team's leaders 
in steals, assists, scoring, minutes 
played, three-pointers and free 
throws. Her 2.38 steals per game 
rank her seventh in th.e league, 

while her 3.15 assists per game 
ties her with teammate 
Genevieve Ruvald for eleventh in 
the conference. The 5'5" junior 
is even averaging 2.3 rebounds 
per game. 

But Fok's contributions don't 
stop there. 

"She's a very strong, dynamic 
leader: said head coach Judy Mai-
one. "[She's) very outspoken and a 
very high-energy person." 

In fact, her energy was a prob-
lem at the beginning of the sea-
son. 

Â·She's a little bit quicker than 
we are at times and she gets down 
the floor quicker than everyone 
and tries to do it all herself," Mai-
one said. 

"[Now] she's doing better con-
trolling and .setting up the 
offense." 

Not only is Fok directing the 

offense, but she is also leading the 
Tritons during their inaugural 
season in Division II. A transfer 
from UC Davis, Fok came to 
UCSD after feuding with her 
Davis coach and being kicked off 
the team after her sophomore 
year. 

"I was a little too intense: Fok 
said. "The coach didn't really like 
me, which was weird since I was . 
recruited so heavily. My sopho-
more year we didn't make it into 
the pl~offs (Fok was benched. for 
a significant part of the season) 
and the coach told me there was-
n't a spot for me next year, and 
that the team 'wasn't going in my 
direction:" 

She then called every team in 
the conference, hoping to be able . 
to play for a team that would get
