EPA grants pennit 
allowing burning 
of toxic wastes 

ByPORSCHESHANTZ 

A permit was recently given to 
Ogden/GA Technologies by the 
Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) to burn over 600 types of 
toxic substances in the Torrey Pines 
Mesa area. 

Since the permit has already: 
been granted, and the California 
Department of Health Services 
announced on Sept. 25 that it will 
not require an Environmental 
Impact Report (EIR) to be filed by 
Ogden, the issue raised by oppo-
nents is the legality of the actions 
taken by the Department of 
Health_ 

An organization known as the 
Environmental Health Coalition 
(EHC) announced on Thursday, 
Oct. 29 that it is filing a formal suit 
against the state on grounds that 
the permit given by the Department 
of Health is in violation of the Cali-

not fully protect the public from the 
improper handling of hazardous 
materials. " A follow-up report 
issued last year stated that the 
department had improved "but still 
needs continued improvement in 
regulating facilities ... that handle 
hazardous waste." 

"In deciding not to require full 
environmental review of this pro· 
posal, the state of California is 
apparently choosing to ignore the 
CEQA," Golding added. "Such an 
action demonstrates a total lack of 
interest to the concerns that have 
been expressed on behalf of the 
215,000 San Diegans who live or 
work within three miles of this 
hazardous waste incineration site." 

However, Ogden officials feel 
. that there has been substantial pub· 

lie involvement in the proposed pro-
ject. "To date there have been over 
eight public hearings and we have 
given 70 tours to local organiza-

Ogden, a New York company, bought the toxic waste incinerator 
division of GA Technologies earlier this year. 

fornia Environmental Quality Act 
(CEQA), which requires an EIR 
for controversial health issues such 
as this. 

"I have never seen a more clear· 
cut situation calling for an EIR, nor 
a more obvious violation of 
CEQA," declared Richard Whar-
ton, professor of law and director of 
the Environmental Law Clinic, and 
the attorney for the EHC. 

"I join with the EHC, who acted 
responsibly in requesting an EIR, in 
expressing my frustration that the 
State Department of Health Servi-
ces would so blatantly ignore Cali-
fornia law," County Supervisor 
Susan Golding said. 

A 1981 auditor's report said 
that the Department of Health "does 

tions of the incineration site," said 
Maya Rohr, senior permit engineer 
at the Ogden incinerator. 

The Department of Health has 
not limited the types of toxic waste 
to be incincerated. The permit also 
does not require emissions to be 
sampled during test burns. Ogden 
plans to burn substances such as 
benzene, toluene, PCB's and heavy 
metals such as arsenic, lead and 
mercury. 

The Department of Health Ser-
vices Toxic Substances Control 
Division released a statement say· 
ing that an EIR was not required by 
law because "an extensive study, 
which included the thorough review 
of tests and studies conducted by

Reggae Splash '87 was shut down Saturday night because of complaints about the loudness of the 
music. 

Reggae concert shut down 
By ELIZABETH MAYNARD 
Stall Writ.,. 

The Reggae Splash '87 concert 
was shut down by San Diego police 
Saturday night, after local com- ' 
plaints about the noise. 

An angry crowd, about 2 ,500, 
shouted "no, no, no," to no avail 

after Mikey Dread, a popular Reg· 
gae musician (and producer of 
UB40 and The Clash), interrupted 
his performance to announce to the 
crowd the concert was being shut 
down. After pleas to cooperate, the 
crowd dispersed relatively peace-
fully. 

According to San Diego police, 

citizen complaints began in the 
early afternoon and continued into 
the evening despite many attempts 
to lower the volume. Tom Peab-
ody, with ASUCSD Community-
Public Relations, was disappointed 
in the complaints as the surround· 
ing communities had been notified

Rumors of budget cuts in 
CSO program unfounded 
By MAUREEN SPURR 

Longer response rates from 
CSOs (Community Service Offic-
ers), which caused concern about 
budget cuts, the well-being of the 
program, and student safety can be 
attributed to a variety of factors 
excluding budget cuts. 

The CSOs, a group of 26 UCSD 
students who offer escorts and per-
form a variety of services across 
campus nightly, have begun the fall 
quarter with nearly a 20 percent 
increase in calls from last spring 
quarter. 

"These guys are really working 
their tails off," Crime Prevention 
Officer AI Jenkins said, who attrib· 
uted the recent waiting.period in· 
crease to new advertisements, new 
freshmen, the time change, recent 
early rains, and that the beginning 
of the fall quarter is historically the 
busiest time of year for the CSO 
program. 

Jenkins said that the surpri ·jng 

increase was completely unex· 
pected, and they are trying to 
adjust accordingly. Last spring, the 
average number of calls was 60 per 
night; this quarter they've aver-
aged 85, and have exceeded or 
reached the 1 OO·mark several times 
during the busy days of Sunday 
through Thursday. 

Rumors about budget cuts have 
proven false , as the budget has 
remained at a steady $152,406 
yearly for the CSO program for at 
least the past two years. In addi· 
tion, the Recharge Committee has 
given permission to raise the rates 
for CSOs services at special events 
or lockups, as well as increase the 
amount of recharges performed. 
This was recently proposed by the 
police department in order to in-
crease and generate more funds for 
the CSO program. 

"We have realigned the time, 
not the budget," Chief Anderson 
said. "Les people are working 
more hours in order to be cost effec-
tive." Anderson went on to explain 

that building lockups have been 
eliminated because night custodio 
ans have returned, and that the 
number of CSOs necessary to cover 
the responsibilities of the escort 
program and the campus can 
remain at five or six, more being a 
waste of the program's funds . 

Members of last year's team of 
36 reportedly had too much time 
on their hands and too few hours, 
so employee lay-offs reduced the 
team by approximately 10 mem-
bers in order to compensate. And· 
erson also added to the list of fac-
tors causing the increase in calls 
both the increase in the number of 
students and the decentralized park-
ing at UCSD. 

"Really, six guys is sufficient," 
said Pete Butler, CSO and Revelle 
senior. "You can't forget that before 
we had three guys doing lock-up 
and three patrolling. Now, we have 
twice as many escorting, and sure, 
it gets busy, but when we're not, it 
isn't practical havinl{ more than we

Astronomer Burbidge honored 
by Mt. Holyoke College 

Dr. E. Margaret Burbidge, director of 
the Center for Astrophysics and Space 
Sciences at the University of California, 
San Diego, and one of the world's most 
renowned astronomers, was honored by 
MI. Holyoke College in Massachusetts 
on the occasion of its 150th anniversary 
last Nov. 8 . 

Burbidge was chosen as one of four 
recipients of the Sesquicentennial Medal 
to be presented at Mr. Holyoke's 
Founder's Day celebration. The other 
three honorees were: author Eudora 
Welty; Simone Veil, past president of the 
European Parliament; and Eddah 
Gachukia, an educator and organizer of 
the Nairobi Forum which closed the 
United Nations Decade for Women. 

All four women were honored "for 
making significant contributions to 
human understanding." Each received a 
special medal designed specifically for the 
occasion. 

Burbidge is known for research that 
has contributed substantially to our basic 
understanding of outer space. Her work 
has earned her an international 
reputation and numerous distinguished 
a wards, including the National Medal of 
Science in 1984 , considered by many to be 
be America 's most presti gious scientific 
honor . She holds 11 honora ry degrees. 

Burbidge is probably best known for 
her research on the nature of quasa rs, 
distant mysterious star-like objects that , 
unlike ordinary stars, emit radio signals; 
for her theory of how stars produce 
heavy elements; and for her 
investigations of the properties of 
galaxies, in particular for measuring their 
mass, rotation and elemental 
composition. 

She is also the co-principal inve.tigator 
on the faint object spectograph, which 
will be aboard NASA's . pace telescope 
when it is launched . The instrument was 
designed to analyze the chemical 
composition of quasars , bodies in 
distance galaxies and other extremely

faint objects in space. 
Burbidge, one of a handful of faculty 

members appointed University Professor 
by the University 01 California , is a 
member of the National Academy of 
Sciences and the American Philosophical 
Society and a fellow of the Royal Society 
01 London. She was president of the 
American Astronomical Society from 
1976· 78 and president of the American 
Association for the Advancement of 
Science, the world's largest scientilic 
organization, from 1982·83.

Grad student re-introduces 
unknown novel by Alcott 

The literary enterprise of UCSD 
master's degree candidate Octavia 
Cowan is behind the republication of "A 
Modern Mephistopheles," the only novel 
published anonymously by 19th century 
author Louisa May Alcott . 

Cowan , studying in the department of 
literature, is responsible for interesting a 
popular paperback firm in the 
republication of the long-out-of-print 
novel , which now contains an 
introduction by Cowan. 

Through Cowan's efforts, this novel 
has been republished by Bantam Books . 
Cowan was inspired, she said, to pursue 
a mass-market publisher not only to 
ma ke the novel readily a vailable to the 
public, but also to modern critics. 

.. Although the novel has been the 
subject of some scholarly criticism," 
Cowan noted, " it deserved much more 

attention." When Cowan started the 
project, there were no editions of the 
book in print. "Now there are two, 
including the Bantam version," she said. 

Alcott, who wrote the book " Little 
Women, " a work which has been read 
and admired for generations, also penned 
" A Modern Mephistopheles, " a work 
which reveals the darker side of her 
imagination. 

Early in her career, Alcott secretly 
addressed adult concerns in her 
senasational short stories. After the 
success of "Litt le Women," however , she 
apparently no longer ventured into this 
genre for fear of losing popularity and 
income, except to produce the 
anonymous" A Modern Mephistopheles" 
for a "no-name" series of works written 
by contemporary 19th century authors. 
The publishing house challenged its 
readers to guess the names of the famous 
authors who wrote for the series. 

In rich language, the book tells a tale 
of seductive evil, awakening sensuality, 
and insatiable ambition . Pitting deceit 
against uncompromising honesty, Alcott 
describes a struggle between the morbid 
manipulations of a ruthless man and the 
passionate commitment 01 a young 
woman. 

Far Irom being a children's story, as 
was "Little Women," "A Modern 
Mephistopheles" touches upon such 
controversial topics as atheism, 
seduction, extra-marital interests and 
drug use. 

Economics and religion 
conference held at USD 

A variety of topics from tariff and 
quota policies that affect economic 
development, the poor, jobs and justice, 
the arms race and contents of the 
economic program will be discussed Nov. 
14 from 8:30 am to 3:30 pm at the 
University of San Diego's Camino 
Theater. 

The keynote address will be delivered 
by Rev. Joseph Daoust, S.J . Dr. Daoust, 
a Jesuit priest who has served as a staff 
member of the House Ways and Means 
Committee of the U.S. Congress. He has 
lectured extensively on economics, public 
policy and Catholic Social Teaching and 
currently teaches at the University of 
Detroit. 

Registration is $8. Call the Peace and 
Justice Commission office at 231 ·2828 , 
ext. 62 for more information.

have now." Butler said he had not 
heard many complaints, and he 
feels the CSO morale is high, espe-
cially since the crew added three 
new members on Oct. 30. 

A common concern around 
campus is that the altitude " it won' t 
happen to me" will become more 
prevalent among women as a result 
of an unhealthy CSO program, and 
longer waits may result in more 
women walking alone a t night . 
Officer Jenkins emphasized that 
the three new officers should reduce 
the waiting periods and make the 
program more efficient , though he 
feels it is a healthy one right now. 

"They are well-liked , well ·:e-
~pected and popular group," Jen-
kins said of the CSOs. Jenkins, 
who has headed the CSO program 
for nearly two years now, feels this 
group is doing a fantastic job. On 
busy nights of up to a 100 calls, the 
CSOs barely have time for a break. 
Jenkins would also like to see more 
money for the program. 

Both Jenkins and Anderson 
agree that a half-hour wait is too 
long, and that it was the longest 
anyone had complained about wait · 
in g. However, thin gs are leveling 
off and J enkins is work ing closely 
with the officers and with statistics 
m order to learn how to adjust to 
the ir new popularity . Then , they 
say, there will be more time for the 
other dut ie~ , such as noting open 
buildmgs and potential hazards .

times the acceptable level of

"To the average person, this 
looks like a total waste-in, total

Garland explained. "The problem 
with incineration is it doesn't neces· 
sarily destroy compounds, it some·

Commentary_ 
Pound seizure and 
medical research 

By STUART ZOLA.MORGAN, PhD 
The recent commentary by Cris Waller (G uardian, Oct . 26), a 

spokesperson for local groups opposed to animal research, contains 
a number of assertions about the use of pound animals as research 
subjects that are completely unfounded . More importantly, the 
assertions are an attempt by Ms. Waller and animal activist groups 
whose stated goal is the abolition of 0/1 animal-related research to 
misinform the UCSD community , and have us believe that pound 
animall are not needed or important in biomedical research. 

Contrary to Ms. Waller's claims, the truth is that pound animals 
have played a critical role in the development of several life-saving 
procedures. Ms. Waller claims in her article that "research done_. _ 
on pound animals is trivial , painful , and a waste of tax dollars," and 
that "pound animals are inappropriate for qua~ty research." The 
facts show that just the opposi te is true. For instance, pound animals 
have played a critical role in the development of cardiopulmonary 
bypass techniques that extend thousands of people's lives each 
year. This work was done almost exclusively with dogs, a nd mainly 
on dogs obtained from the pound. We need to ask the thousands of 
people whose lives have been saved by this technique whether they 
believe this research is "trivial" a nd "inappropriate." 

As another example, here at UCSD. researchers using pound 
dogs almost exclusively have successfully developed techniques for 
treating patients immediately following a heart attack. These tech-
niques have substantially increased the chances of survival and 
have now become standard procedures throughout the country. 

Ms. Waller claims that because the genetic background of pound 
animals is unknown, the results obtained from research using pound 
animals are uninterpretable. But , once again, the facts support a 
different conclusion. Although some research projects do require 
animals whose genetic make-up must be known, for many other 
projects genetically varied animals like those obtained from the 
pound are acceptable and even preferable. The diverse genetic 
make-up of pound a nimals is analogous to the variations in genetic 
backgrounds among humans, especially in the United States. 

Many injuries and diseases strike humans without regard to theIr 
genetic history. For research in these area~ , pound or shelter amm-
als may best approxImate the human conditton . For this reason, 
animals from pounds are SUItable and are used for re.eaTch in 
cardiovascular d,seases, cancer, dIabetes, orthopedIC tnJune., bIrth 
defec b , hearing loss, bltndne~s, asthma and lung dIsorders, tnfec-
tlous diseast!s and drug rt!actlOn . Indeed, "hen) ou receIve medl

The truth about Ginsberg 
By ROBfRTLEONE 
Staff Writer 

On Thursday, Na-
tional Public Radio's 
Nina Totenberg told the 
world that Supreme 
Court appointee Douglas 
H . Ginsberg smoked 
marijuana , and that 
some claimed Ginzberg

He'd been a federal judge 
for about a year, which 
is far too short a time for 
hi, judicial opinions to 
have piled up lomething

young, 41 yean old -
not old enough to have 
accumulated the extent 
of judicial experience 
which the Senate look.

Staunch conservative 
Senator Orrin Hatch re-
sponded to T otenberg' s 
report with the political-
ese equivalent to "no big 
deal," noting that cal-
ual, experimental use of 
marijuana is a common 
experience among mem-
bers of the "yuppie 
generation." (Hatch 's 
sentiments were mirrored 
in an informal poll of 
Guardian editors).

had no courtroom expe-
rience during that time, 
lave the attendance of 
one trial. 

Let's start with the 
facts. The NPR story is 
about as true as any 
such story can be. Although occasionally perceived as 
liberal, NPR is rarely confused with Soviet disinforma-
tion organs. Totenberg has been NPR's legal affairs 
correspondent for years, and is a respected and compe-
tent reporter used to dealing with controversial stories. 
Besides, Ginsberg had admitted his use of marijuana . 

South Dakota Senator Larry Pressler's constituents 
may have difficulties with a Supreme Court appointee 
who had admitted drug use , but I haven't met any yet. 

But, that's it right there. While Robert Bork faced 
intense polihcal opposition from Democrats and liber-
als , and fought out to the full Senate confirmation vote, 
Ginsberg folded before the Democrats and Liberals had 
a chance to gri ll him . Ginsberg was stabbed in the back. 

Mo~l objections to Ginsberg were not based on 

p He apparently cIi.tor-
ted the truth (probably 

< accidently) about his fed-
eral courtoom experience 
in documents filed with 
the Senate. While with 
the Justice Department, 
he worked on a case 
involving the cable tele-
vision industry while he 

owned more than $100,000 worth of stock in a cable 
TV company, which gives the appearance of conflict of 
interest. 

But, unnamed conservatives in the Senate were 
troubled by abortions his wife performed during her 
medical residency. They were also troubled by his 
having lived out of wedlock with his current wife, and 
then came the marijuana disclosures. 

Ginsberg may not be as flaky/spooky as Bork, but 
his lifestyle and personal life may have shot him down 
before the Senate, or anyone else, had a chance to ask 
serious questions about his qualifications for the 
Supreme Court bench. He's out of it. 

So, while lhe politica l funsters are saying "Douglas

United States, approximately 15 
million animals were de'stroyed by 
pounds [so far] this year. Here in 
San Diego, 25,115 animals [have 
been] de5lroyed by the pound. Why 
is Ms. Waller not concerned about

Ms. Waller also makes several 
erroneo us st.atements about 
UCS 0' s record and commitment to 
good animal care. UCSD takes 
seriously its responsibility to assure 
the highest level of humane ca re 
and treatment of animals involved 
in research. We have had an active 
Animal Subject Committee which 
reviews in detail every aspec t 
(including housing, feeding, anes-
thesia, surgery, analgesia, postop-
erative recovery, behavioral test-
ing, and euthanasia) of every pro-
ject involving animals, including 
animals obtained from the pound. 
Three memben of this committee 

are individuals associated with 
animal Humane Societies here in 
San Diego, are not researchers and 
have no affiliation with UCSD. The 
treatment of the animals and the 
procedures used in any research 
project must be to their satisfaction 
before the scientist is even allowed 
to order the animals for the project. 

Because researchers at UCSD 
(including those who use pound 
animals) have been awarded Uni-
ted States Public Health Service 
funds, UCSD is required to follow 
straight regula tions regarding all 
aspects of animal use. Our animal 
facilities are regularly inspected by 

federal regulatory agencies, as well 
as state and local agencies. These 
inspections are often unannounced 
ahead of time, and as a result of 
these inspections UCSD has 
emerged as a recognized national 
leader in regard to its humane care 
and use of animals in research. 

II medical researchers could no 
longer obtain pound animals , the 
development of life-saving proce-
dures would be slowed and human 
lives would be lost. In addition, 
animals would have to be bred spe-
cifically for use in research, and 
that would result in eventual death 
of two animals instead of one (the

animal that would be put to death in 
the pound as well as the purpose-
bred animal). 

Ms. Waller and her associates 
would have us believe that killing 
animals in the pound is more virtu-
ous than having them help to 
advance medical knowledge and 
ultimately benefit human and 
animal life. No one enjoys using 
animals in medical research, but 
the fact remains that, for the fore· 
seeable future, pound animals are 
essential to medical progress.

of the "Splash" and the possible

The day. long Reggae festival, 
funded and organized by students 
and sponsored by ASUCSD, Third 
College, and the African American 
Student Union, was designed to 
offer a different kind of cultural 
experience to the UCSD student 
body . Reggae music, which popu· 
larizes African Nationalism, cultu· 
ral unity and peace among all peo· 
pie with a Jamaican rhythm, at· 
tracted a very diverse group of 
people, most of whom were not 
UCSD students. This diversity as 
well as the open·air nature of the 
event, may have created problems 
in the control of alcohol and mario 

juana at thi~ "alcohol free" event. 
The audience was filled with people 
openly smoking and drinking. 

Several San Diego police offic· 
ers, observing the muddied and 
beer can littered grounds, suggested 
that the noise was only part of the 
problem. They recommended that 
future UCSD events such as this be 
held inside, where the crowd could 
be " frisked" for such items and 
where the noise levels could be 
contained. 

T om Peabody compared the 
Reggae Splash this year to The

was also closed down because of

Mushroom toxin battles cancer 
By ROBERT SWEENEY 
Guardian Intern 

Researchers at the UCSD Cancer 
Center are working on a unique, 
new cancer.fighting agent called 
illudin, a potent toxin derived from 
the jack.o' ·Iantern mushroom. 

The research was started about 
two years ago. Initially, the interest 
in the illudin was not extraordinary, 
but this changed when researchers 
discovered the illudin's high pot· 
ency and tumor cell~ would not be 
able to build up a resistance to it. 

The illudin seems to have better 
effects on myeloid and T·cell 
leukemias than any other cancer· 
fighting agent. 

toxicity in tumor cells is acceptable, 
so that you can try and use it for 
therapy ." 

This is just one of the problems 
the researchers are facing - not 
knowing what dosages are safe to 
use. Research has just recently 
been started to find out the proper 
dosages to use. 

Another problem faced by reo 
searchers is learning how to man· 
ipulate the illudin molecule without 
it falling apart. The iIIudin is an 
unusual compound and the reo 
searchers do not know what to pre· 
serve on the molecule to keep it 
toxic. This has presented the reo 
searchers with an interesting chem· 
ical problem, which might prove 
insurmountable. 

a genetically engineered antibody 
that searches out speci fi c cells. 
This allows the illudin to be led 
directly to the tumor cell. 

Dr. T aetle said that the statistics 
were poor concerning cancer reo 
search, and that they can only hope 
that the present research teaches 
them something they can use in 
future research. 

Working with Dr. Taede is Dr. 
Trevor McMorris, a UCSD chem. 
istry professor who first deterined 
the molecular structure of iIIudins in 
the 1960s, and Dr. Michael Kelner, 
assistant professor of pathology at 
the UCSD School of Medicine. 

T oxic incinerator 
The research so far has been 

done with in· vitro testing, experi. 
ments performed in test tubes, and 
the results were impressive. How· 
ever, testing has not been done with 
in·vivo (in a living organism) exper· 
iments, and only these experiments 
can demonstrate · whether or not 
illudins can work in humans with· 
out causing death. 

Also, the therapeutic index, the 
difference between the affect on 
normal cells and the affect on 
tumor cells , is likely to be narrow. 
This concerns the researchers 
because they might have to make a 
derivative of illudin that is chemi· 
cally similar, if the index is too 
narrow. 

Dr. Kelner is doing research , 
using a grant from the Leukemia 
Society, on why the illudin is so 
potent and how it blocks I=ell 
replication. @)

San Diego City Council. The city 
counci l has made no public notice 
of when the hearing regarding this 
permit will be held. 

It has taken Ogden 2112 years to 
obtain the EPA permit. It was then 
appealed by EHC and alter a six· 
month review by the EPA it was 
found that there was no health risk . 
"There was no substantial docu· 
mentation from the EHC to uphold 
the appeal ," Rohr said . 

The permit given by the San 
Diego Air Pollution Control Dis· 
trict requires Ogden to submit an 
analysis of exactly what wastes will 
be incinerated to the Department of 
Health and the EPA prior to every 
test. The report must be filed one 
month in advance and must include 
a specific waste risk assessment of 
the particular substance. If the 
department and EPA do not give 
their approval, the test will not take 
place. [Q] 

Researchers Dr. Raymond Tae·

further in their research, the reo

Escape from Iran: one student's story 
By VAN HUTCHINSON 
Stall Writer 

Editor's note: This article is the 
(irst of two interviews with UCSD 
students who halle escaped (rom 
religious persecution in Iran. Both 
A.B. and .E. requested anonym-
ity. To tell their stories is painful 
(or them - some of their relatives 
are imprisoned at this writing -
but they assert that their story must 
be known. 

A.B. cannot return to her native 
country. An Iranian who suffered 
at the hands of the Revolutionary 
Guards, she endured three months 
of daily interrogation and mistreat-
ment in prison. Later, A .B. escaped 
from the country . 

Neither a political prisoner nor a 
criminal, A .B. was placed in soli -
tary confinement 40 steps under-
ground. Her crime. in the eyes of 
the Ayatollah regime, was that she 
professed a religious faith "hereti -
cal to Islam. " 

A.B . IS a member of the Baha'i 
Faith, a worldwide religion of close 
to five million people. But in Iran , 
Baha'i is a religious minority num· 
bering only 500,000 followers in 
the predominantly Muslim nation. 
Other religious groups, such as 
Jews and Christians, are also per-
secuted by the current regime in 
Teheran, but are not pursued as 
vehemently by the Revolutionary 
Guard as the Baha'is, the largest of 
these minority groups. 

In the last eight years, hundreds 
of thousands of Baha'is have been 
stripped of jobs, educational oppor-
tunities , homes and possessions. 
Several thousand Baha'is have been 
abducted, tortured, and systemati-
cally massacred because they will 
not renounce their faith - not at 
t he point of a gun, a knife, or at the 
threat of the death of their whole 
family . 

Growing up, A.B. was an honors 
student in school , involved in ice-
skating and track. After graduat. 
ing from secondary school she 
began to take on leadership roles in 
the local community of Baha'is , 
reading scriptures with friends and 
teaching classes for children . The 
government interfered little with the 
practice of her religion at this time. 

The revolution of 1979 changed 
this drastically. Baha'is were singled 
out as scapegoats by the Ayatol-
lah's regime. The Revolution Guard 
abducted Baha'i leaders , executing 
or throwing them in prison. Baha'i 
bank accounts were taken and they 
were prohibited from holding jobs 
within the government and even 
from worshipping together. 

By the end of the first three years 
of the revolution, several thousand 

Baha'is, had been killed . These 
deaths, and in some cases disap. 
pearances have been documented 
by the United Nations and the 
international body of the Baha'is . 

A.B. was aware of this danger 
and continued to practice her reli-
gion openly . 

In 1981. the Revolutionary 
Guard came to her house. She saw 
them ring the doorbell , hand a 
letter to her parents , then drive 
away. 

The same group came back a 
few days later, and A.B. hid up· 
stairs. "Two of them came in, and 
they put guns to my Dad's back. 
My Mom was almost fainting," she 
recalled. 

A.B. climbed out a window and 
ran to a neighbor's house. When 
they refused to help her , she ran to 
another's house. This time she was 
kept safe until a crowd of neighbors 
assembled in the street. The pres-
ence of the crowd intimidated the 
Revolutionary Guard into leaving. 
A.B . said, "You see, they don't 
want everybody to know that they 
arrest Baha'is ." 

Immediately following this inci-
dent , her parents tried to send A.B. 
out of the country. However, by 
1981 no Baha'is were allowed to 
leave. Her parents gave her pass-
port to a person who said he could 
help her out of Iran. A .B. said, 
"But I am going to bring all my 
books and notes that I have col-
lected for all this time." 

Her parents objected, saying it 
would be too dangerous to bring 
her religious books with her. 

The collaborator, who urged 
A.B. to bring her books and notes, 
turned out to be an agent for the 
regime. Before she got to the border, 
the Revolutionary Guard came and 
arrested her . 

During the first part of her impri· 
sonment, A .B. overheard the 
guards discussing her fate. One 
said, "She's only 18, we could let 
her go." But the warden asked, 
"Are these notes and books yours?" 
When A.B. responded, " Yes," he 
said, "She's a Baha'i, so we have to 
keep her." 

A.B. remembered those days 
vividly: " Later they blindfolded me 
and brought me to another place. 
Sometimes I fell down or hit my 
head. Only they wouldn't touch 
me. They said, 'You are a Baha'i. 
You are unclean.' 

"They brought me to prison. I 
remember walking 40 steps under-
ground. Everyday they would come 
and ask me to deny my faith . They 
said that if I did , they would let me 
go. But I didn't. They asked me to 
tell the names of all my Baha'i 
friends. But I didn't tell them.

I didn't tell them. 
"They said, "Y ou are young, you 

lack discrimination. Forget these 
ideas.' 

"I said, you are keeping me here 
because of my religion. 

"They replied , ' It 's because you 
are a spy. Baha'i are spies for Israel 
and the U.S .' 

"Then they told me I had 15 
days to deny my faith , or else they 
would kill me." 

After a month in prison, A .B. 
got sick. The authorities called a 
doctor. He gave her some medi-
cine, bu t she did not get better. 
Then they told her that they were 
moving her to a new prison. 

It was their way of concealing 
that she was to go free . Her parents 
were allowed to take her home as 
long as her father gave up the deed 
to their house. 

In 1982, the Revolutionary 
Guard came for A.B. again. This 
time they brought her to Evin, a

prison used especially for "enemies 
olthe Revolution." A.B. said, " Itis 
said that if you go in you might 
never come out again." 

A.B. soon learned she had been 
placed on Death Row. At the age 
of 18, she was sentenced to die. 

The Guards continued to prom· 
ise A.B. freedom if she would 
recant her faith. She refused. She 
said, " I know it sounds strange, but 
I was really happy. I had been 
arrested because of my faith . Mar· 
tyrs have a high station in the 
Baha'i faith . They know they are 
servinj( hum&nity. We believe man-
kind is one, and that some of us 
may have to die for the cause." 

This stalemate continued for two 
and a half months. Finally, the 
authorities said that if her parents 
would pay them a certain amount, 
they would let her leave temporar-
ily. A.B. said, "If I didn't return, 
one of [my parents] would have to 
take my place." 

Her parents and her uncle got 
her oul of prison. They resolved to 
get her out of the country aa well, 
and hired someone they could trust 
to bring her over the border. 

(Her unde was fined because 
she had lelt , but he was not put in 
prison. Her parents fled to the 
northern sections of Iran .) 

One night during November of 
1983, A.B. got in a van with 15 
other people. She said, "We drove 
through the mountains with the 
lights off . In some parts we had to 
get out and push the car. It took 
about three hours before we crossed 
the Pakistani border. If we had 
been seen, we would have been 
shot." 

A.B. spent almost a year in Pak· 
istan before getting a special visa to 
Italy. Then she came to San Diego 
to be reunited with part of her fam-
ily here. She enrolled at Southwest-
ern CoileRe and later at UCSD.

Astronaut A week to know about AIDS 
discusses 
shuttle 
By DAVID BROOKS 
Guardian Intem 

Astronaut Richard Covey, the pilot for the next scheduled space shuttle flight, spoke 
about the future of the u.s. space 
program at a public forum last 
Thursday at Peterson Hall. 

Colonel Covey, an experienced 
astronaut with more than 170 hours 
logged in space, spoke of the need 
for the American people to place 
the Challenger tragedy behind them 
and remember that it is "only seven 
months before we fly again." 

I n the past 21 months since the 
Challenger explosion, NASA has 
revamped much of the Space Shut-
tle Program. Specifically, Covey 
and the astronauts aboard the June 
1988 space shuttle will fly with 
special escape parachutes and will 
wear pre&surized suits - features 
unavailable to past shuttle astro-
nauts. 

Colonel Covey defended NASA 
against criticism that the agency 
has been unable to recover follow-
ing the Challenger tragedy. Ac-
cording to Covey, NASA did not 
want to send another shuttle into 
orbit until the now infamous o-rings 
- responsible for the sealing 
together of the booster segments of 
the shuttle - had been redesigned. 

Richard Covey 
To Covey's delight, testing of the 
o-rings has so far been successful 
and all signs indicate that the space 
shuttle will liftoff in June. 

Stressing the need for further 
space exploration, Covey predicts 
with confidence that by the year 
2000 the United States will have 
an orbiting space sta tion and a col· 
ony on the moon. In addition, 
NASA hopes to explore Mars, 
Venus and the sun. NASA also 
intends to provide a significant 
increase in the opportunities open 
for non-astronauts to explore space. 

At one point in his speech, the 
astronaut was asked by an elemen-
tary school student about what he 
plans to do while in space. Covey 
told the youngster , "We'll put up 
satellites, take pictures ... and play 
with our food ." 

Covey's appearance was co· 
sponsored by the San Diego 
Supercomputer Center and the 
UCSD Industrial Liason Program.

Guardian Intern 

As the number of reported AIDS 
and ARC (AIDS-Related Complex) 
cases grow to astounding heights, 
many researchers believe that in 
three to five years all of us will be 
touched personally by the AIDS 
issue, possibly in knowing someone 
with the disease and/or contracting 
the virus ourselves . 

In light of this, the AIDS Educa-
tion and Prevention Task Force of 
UCSD was formed to make people 
more aware of the disease. The 
group is hosting "AIDS Awareness 
Week: A Focus on AIDS ," on 
campus, Nov . 9·12. 

Comprised of students, faculty , 
staff, and members of the commun-
ity , the task force itself is divided 
into several sub·committees. The 
education team works to dissemi-
nate the most up.to·date AIDS-
related information to the campus 
community . The medical/ technical 
team strives to find and evaluate 
the most up-to-date material 
regarding AIDS. They were also 
the group responsible for finding 
the speakers for the week's events. 

The financial segment of the 
task force is still in the process of 
being defined. With the financial 
support from the student govern-
ments of each college, the A.S. and 
community members, and the con-
tributing efforts of various student 
groups, such as LAGO (Lesbian 
and Gay Organization), the AIDS 
Education and Prevention Task 
Force was able to organize "AIDS 

Awareness Week." 
"Education is the only tool 

against this disease," said Christine 
Oakley, chairperson for the educa· 
tion committee of the task force 
and coordinator of the Women's 

Clinic at Student Health Services. 
The primary aims of the week are 
not only to educate the campus 
community on the factual informa-
tion regarding AIDS, but also " to

In her lirst two years here, she 
was so active in school and com·

awarded the United States Achieve·

At UCSD, A.B. has been very 
active in the Baha'i Club, whose 
main ellort is to promote under· 
standing 01 Baha'i principles. 

A.B. does not hold animosity 
toward her captors or the Ayatol. 
lah. She said, "As a Baha'i, I don't 
hate anyone. We believe we should 
be kind even to our enemies. 
Besides, they are helping our faith 
become known to the world . Kho·

raise the sensitivity level of every· 
one on campus to the issue," Oak· 
ley added. 

Oakley feels it is necessary to 
convey the idea that AIDS "is not 
just a statistical disease that 
happens to someone else. It is 
something that happens to real 
human beings with real leelings 
and real experiences." Two of this 
week's activities are directly related 
to this point. 

"We will try to make it an emo· 
tional as well as an intellectual 
experience," Christine Oakley said. 

Thursday, at noon, there will be 
an event called " Focus on the l-er. 
sonal Perspective," where evegpne 
interested will have a chance to 
meet the AIDS patients and tearn 
about their personal experiences. 

Throughout the week, there will 
be a display 01 paintings and paetry 
by AIDS patients under the coor· 
dination of author and art,therapist, 
Barbara Peabody. Peabody is the 
author of "The Screaming Room,"

her son was dying of AIDS. She is 
also a co· founder 01 MAP (Moth· 
ers 01 AIDS Patients) which pro· 
vides support to mothers and fami· 
lies of AIDS patients. 

T hree years ago, Peabody 
became an art therapist work ing 
with people with lile·threatening 
diseases. She describes their art as 
"a non· verbal way lor people with 
AIDS and ARC to express their 
feelings about AIDS. It is one thing 
that can help them deal with the 
disease emotionally and, in some 
cases, it has opened up a whole 
new career . ... and it is a reason to 
live." 

Peabody also addressed the issue 
of homophobia in relation to the 
AIDS epidemic, "The image of 
AIDS as a gay disease is errone· 
ous," she said. " It is also a hetero· 
sexual disease. It is a human dis· 
ea»e. I hope that students attend 
the events and learn something -

Men's soccer shot down in a shoot out 
Lose 4-3 to CSU San Bernardino 
after regulation and double overtime 

By BRIAN ITOW 
Stoff Writer 

The Tritons have been playing 
Russian roulette with theiT incon· 
sistent offense all season long. They 
have been very fortunate compiling 
a 12·5-2 record and Qualifying for 
the NCAA Division III playoffs. 
On Saturday, the gun finaUy went 
off. UC San Diego was eliminated 
from the Western Regional finals 
by CSU San Bernardino, 1-0 on 
penalty kicks. . 

The Tritons, who had been held 
to less than two goals in 1 0 of their 
19 games , were held scoreless for 
90 minutes of regulation and 20 
minutes of overtime before losing 
the shootout four penalty kicks to 
three on the last shot of the match . 

The match was a tightly played 
affair with momentum shifting back 
and forth between the two sides. 
Both teams had second hall oppor· 
tunities to end the game in regula. 
tion lime. With 30 minutes remain· 
ing In the match, Coyote forward 
Hector Vribe found himself alone 
with goalkeeper Greg Stadler but 
his shot from eight yards out was 
deflected away. Then, with 19 
minutes remaining, Scott Goodman 
and Rod Cramblit collided, aUow· 
iog Vribe to race to the corner and 
send a cross in to Jerry O 'hara who 
couldn't control it. Three minutes 
later Carrick Brewster took a pass 

from Pieter Koopman and hit a 
shot just over the cross bar from 20 
yards. And, with six minutes left, 
Goodman, Dain DeForest and Scott 
Rommel had the ball six yards in 
fTOnt of the San Bernadino goal but 
no one was able to get a decent shot 
off. 

In overtime, momentum contino 
ued to shih back and forth. Four 
minutes into the first overtime CSU 
Bemadino had its best opportunity 
to score. Midfielder Bill Allsop 
chipped a pass to O'hara. Stadler 
came out to Iry and punch the 'ball 
away. However, the baU deflected 
to Vribe eight yards away from the 
goal but his shot was once again hit 
right 10 a Triton defender. This 
time it was sweeper Craig Gross 
who cleared the ball away from the 
middle of the goal. 

In the second extra period, Rom· 
mel, Mike Kappes and DeForest all 
had shots on goal that were either 
saved or just missed their mark. So. 
it was on to penalty kicks. a game· 
deciding format used only in tour· 
nament competition. 

Coyote goalkeeper Randy Green 
opened the round by making a 
great save of a Rommel shot. 
StadleT returned the favor by sav· 
ing Mike Y arawsky' s penalty kick. 
Then, on Koopman's shot, Green 
appeared to have moved from his 
line too early in saving the goal but 
no caU was made and, then Denny 

Tnton goalkeeper Greg Stadler can 't come up with the final save in UCSO's 4-3 loss 

Carter made his shot. C U San 
Bernardino had a one goal lead. 
The Coyotes held their lead until 
the fifth round when Mike Lodoen 
scored to tie the score. The tying 
score left it up to CSUSB leading 
scorer, O'hara , who had been held 
in check all day. O'hara hit a shot 
into the right corner past a diving 
Stadler for the game winner. 

A UCSD midfielder was disap. 
pointed with the outcome, "I 
thought we dominated the game 

and then it comes down to penalty 
kicks . To get beat that way it just 
doesn't work out." 

"UCSD coach Derek Armstrong 
felt his team had its opportunities to 
win the match, "I think in the game, 
we didn't play badly. We had some 
great position in the box but the 
quality of the passes going in there 
was not very good . ... that's what 
killed us in'the end. We just couldn't 
explode. But it was a very even 
game." 

Triton Tidbits 

San Bernardino coach, Carlos 
Juarez agreed with Armstrong. " It 
was a very even game. Both teams 
had a couple of opportunities to 
score but the score is indicative of 
the way the game was played, a 
0·0 tie, and then it went to over· 
time. It's too bad it had to end on 
penalty kicks but that's the way to 
advance." 

Soccer is the only game where a 
team can keep its opponent from

scoring in a game and still lose. 
This brings into Question the penalty 
kick system al a format for ad· 
vancement. The system does not 
determine the better team . . .. just 
the luckier one. And, on this day, it 
was CSU San Bernardino. 

Both coaches criticized the sys· 
tern as a means for advancement. 
Juarez said, "Penalty kicks are 
something that could go either way. 
The team that .tays more com· 
posed - and if the goalkeeper is 
able to save a couple - then you 
have a great advantage. I don't 
think it's the best way to decide a 
game. We should play one game 
one day and if its tied, play again 
the next. But for economic reasonl 
that's the way it hal to be." 

Armstrong agreed that penalty 
kicks shouldn't be used aa a tie· 
breaking system, "I think we .hould 
play another ten minutes of over· 
time. I mean there's light, there'» 
time, there's no reason we don't 

play another ten minutes. I guess 
we just have to make a recommen· 
dation to committee." 

Although UCSD lost to CSUSB, 
they did win one game, defeating 
the College of St. Thomas 5 -0 on 
Friday. In that game, Rommel put 
on a show for the team from Min· 
nesota Icoring three brilliant goals 
and giving the Triton» an insur· 
mountable second hall lead. Koop. 
man and Brewster added two more 
goals in the laat couple minutes to 
seal the victory and a berth in the 
final against CSU San Bernardino 
who defeated the University of La 
Verne 1-0 earlier in the day. 

The Tritons played both games 
without starting centerback Mike 
Bradley who was out with partiaUy 
torn ligaments in hi. right knee. 
Arm»trong felt that his 10 .. could 
have been the difference in the 
match. "Bradley is probably the 
answer to the game. He is the guy 
who will maybe split the game for 
you. DeForest had to move to cen· 
terback and he gives me aU my

Croa Country 

By PHIL GRUEN 
Stoll Writer 

One would normally expect a 
team that has lost four starters from 
an 18-8 squad a year ago to be in a 
state of shambles. Especially one 
that missed the NCAA Division II 
playoffs by a single victory. One 
would also expect their coach to be 
worried and frantically trying to 
rebuild the t~am. But not UCSD 
men's varsity basketball coach Tom 

Marshall. 
Because of the return of 6 ' 10" 

senior Andy Jedynak (the Tritons 
leading rebounder last year), and a 
superb off·season recruiting pro· 
gram which brought five junior col· 
lege players and five freshmen to 
the UCSD campus, Marshall has 
little reason to be worried. A berth 
in the NCAA Division III playoffs 
may still be a year or two off, but 
judging from Saturday night's scrim· 
mage competition against Gross. 

mont Community College, this 
year's Tritons have no reason to 
shoot for less. I n Saturday's three· 
hall scrimmage, UCSD demolished 
Grossmont in straight sets, 46.23 , 
49-25, and 39-26 (a collective 
134-74 rout). 

An early game yet. but neverthe· 
less Marshall has high expectations 
for the starting five for last Satur-
day's game; the team captain 
Jedynak. senior power forward 

Kevin Stewart (one of only four 
players returning from last year's 
team). JC transfer point guard Rob 
Rittgers, freshman shooting guard 
Tim Rapp, and sophomore small 
forward Andy Wagstaff. Despite 
the obvious talent in these individ· 
uals, aside from Jedynak who has 
basically secured a starting posi. 
tion for the year, Marshall did not 
hesitate to point out that anyone of 
the remaining nine members of the

team, including the other four fresh-
men, could very well challenge for 
a starting spot. 

"Without doubt , they are the 
best group of freshmen we've ever 
had ," Marshall said. "We've got a 
very you ng and active team , and 
there's no question we're bigger 
than ever bel are ." 

No kidding. For one, this yea r's 
new crop of players (including the 
JC Ita'blers) did nol permit three 
players who played on last year's 
team 10 even make the squad . 
Furthermore, the a ddi tion of a ll the 
new players pushes the average 
height of this yea r's tea m to a 
height just shy of 6'5".

a ma tch wi th Division I Southern 
Utah State and contests with NAJA 
schools, Grand Canyon (in the 
Triton Tip·Oll Tournament) and 
Point Lorna Nazarene. Still, Mar-
shall remains most concerned with 
the tough Division IIJ competition, 
namely; Claremont (who, inciden-
tally , is returning nearly all of their 
starters), Cal SI. San Bernardino 
Notre Dame (not from South Bend' 
Indiana - so do not panic), and 
Menlo College.
