·u.s.s. MANDEVILLE: 
Battleship for the Arts 

UCSD'will dedicate its new S~ . 3 million Ernest W. Mandeville 
Center for the Arts with an II-day public festival of music, drama 
and art in the Center March 6 through 16. 

All of the events are open to tbe public. Many are free and 
tickets to the others are available through the UCSD box office. 

The II-day festival bas been desisned to bring to the com-
munity a kaleidoscope of events rangmg from early works of an 
and music to the most avant-garde realism and elecuonicper-
formances. The program will allow the University to show off the 
varied and unique aspects of the Center. . 

The Mandeville Center, designed by A. Quincy Jones and 
Associates of Los Angeles, houses office, lecture and work space 
for the UCSD Departments of Music and Visual Am. Ground was 
broken for the 109,189 square-foot building on January 9, 1973, 
on a site that spans what was once U.S. Highway 101. The Center 
was constructed by Nielsen Construction 'Company of San Diego 
and the flCSt offices and work rooms were occupIed during the 
fall, 1974, academic quaner. 

The Center, a three-level concrete and wood structure, stands 
at the hub of the UCSD campus . It has offices and studios for a 
faculty of 40, music rehearsal rooms that can serve groups as 
large as a full symphony orchestra, shops for wood and metal 
working, space for print and filmmaking, and equipment for 
recordings of the highest fidelity. 

An 851-seat auditorium lecture hall serves as the " focal point" 
of the Center since it is the principle " presentation" area. Its 
unique stage is able to accommodate performances of ballets , 
chamber operas , and Mendelssohn·sized oratorios . The wooden 
stage (96 feet wide and 38 feet deep) provides 3,6~O square feet 
of performing space. In addition, the pit provides another 2 , ~8~ 

. . 

square fe'et of space that is easily convened, through the use ot 
wooden risers , from seating to orchestra space or even additional 
stage space. 

There are some 500 permanent seats and 3~O movable seats 
allowing for a ~reat vanety of stage and audience configurations 
within the audItorium. 

The Center was ~med in honor of the late Ernest W. Man=--
deville, a businessman and patron of the arts whose fmancial 
support to UCSD helped the young campus develop its programs 
in me ans and humanities. 

An ODCn house is schedule-d from noon to ~ :OO pm, on Sunday, 
MilJ'ch. 9. for which a number of special shows and programs have 
been set. A display of super realistic an will be in the An GaJlery 
and a display of scene and costume design, put together by the 
Department of Drama, will be in the East Room. Musicians will 
be "tuning" the building during the day. Visitors will get a look 
inside a laser beam art restoration laboratory. An architects ' 
panel on • 'New Directions in Architecture" featurin~ some of the 
top architects and communicators in Southern Caclifomia is set of 
2:00 pm in room B·210 of the Center. 

An environmental music event, " Museums, " will o~n at noon 
on Sunday in the Recital HaU. The event includes VIdeo works , 
films, electronic music, light compositions and biofeedback 
equipment. Visitors wiU be invited to compose their own music by 
using their brainwaves together with the biofeedback equipolC' nt . 

Student guides will be stationed throughout the building 
during the day to assist visitors in finding their way and to · x-
plain the work going on in the various studios and work hop . 
Refreshments WIll be served in t\l,(0 location in the build ini. 

UC Sa" Diego /¥'edne da ,March 5, 1975 



Edjtorkll 
Cul ... inating years of dreams and momhs o(work, the Erne~t 

W. M~ndevi1le Center for the Am throws open Its doors at last ID 
a gnla ~pening celebration. 

The ans have long been slighted at UCSD, shoved into the 
corners of the campus and largely regarded as having value 
mai nly as a balance for the" hard" sciences, which have made up 
the bulk of the San Diego campus' atmosphere. It is the hope of 
the Triton Times that the implicit subservience of the arts here at 
UCSD will come to an unmoumed end with the opening of the 
Mandeville Center, and the arts will take their rightful place in 
the structure of the campus as an equal to the sciences. 

For the opening, little effort has been spared to bring a 
diversity of quality performances and exhibits. Planning that has 
been in motion for well over a year has served to bring events of 
the highest caliber to UCSD, representing the contemporary 
advances in music, theatre, dance and art, as well as lectures and 
panels uncovering_the roles of Art in Government, its relation to 
science and its effect on our day to day lives, for the eleven day 
openin~ celebration . 

Despite all this planning however, the Mandeville Opening 
Celebration has failed to incorporate one vital element IOto its 
workings : the students of UCSD. The choice of planning the 
opening celebration to coincide with the last week of winter 
quarter when many students are feeling the crunch of ftnishing 
their studies and preparing for fmals seems to show a lack of 
concern . -Even with student prices for many events, there are 
those who feel the cOSt of tickets will prohibit them from at· 
tending a bulk of the events. 

We are all aware of the imponance of the Mandeville Cemer in 
terms of its public-relations value to the campus, and yet in the 
interests of "community involvement," the most immediately 
available community, the students who must live and work with 
the center, have largely been ignored. 

The Triton Times presents this special issue of the IT, striving 
to make the Mandeville Center accessible in the hopes that as 
many students as are able will find their way to events in the 
celebration. Convenient or not, the next 11 days will mark the 
bringin, together of some of the most imporatnt forces in the 
worldo An. 

Furthermore, the Triton Times would like to take this op· 
ponunity to call for a second opening, one that is more open to 
the interests and needs of the students . The time exists to plan an 
evenrof this nature for the end of April , at a time when classes 
and studies would allow for greater studem participation. This 
could then be a celebration of, by and for the students of UCSD , 
and would make the Mandeville center seem less like an im· 
position and more like the imponant landmark to the UCSD 
campus and the world of An that it is and should be.

The Inner City Repertory Dance 
Company's March 8 performance 
at the Mandeville Center 
Auditorium should prove to be 
one of the year's dance highlights 
in San Diego. The multiracial 
modern dance company will 
perform two modern dance 
classics by Donald McKayle, 
"Games" and "Rainbow Round 
My Shoulder," The troupe will 
also present a newer work by 
McKayle, "Songs of the 
Disinherited," as well as 
"Caravanserai," a ballet created 
for the company by Talley B.!atty. 
. The troupe's style has its origins 
in the folk elements of the inner 
city and jazz . Since its 
organization in 1970, the Los 
Angeles-based company has 
become one of the leading dance 
companies in the Western United 
States , The company was well 
received on its Eastern tour in 
1972, by audiences and critics. 
New York Times critic Clive 
Barnes called the company " ... a 
distinquished bunch of' dancers. 
They really have a strong en-
semble feeling ." Describing the 
company's performance of a 
ballet by choreographer McKayle, 
Ann Barzell of Chicago TodaY' 
said, " _ .. they whirled and spun, 
stamped, jumped, bent lithely, 
swaggered and loped, They are 
superbly trained and their skills 
are used artfully by director-
choreographer Donald McKayle 
in works that are dramatic or 
lyric, that convey strong ideas 
powerfully or enchant with the 
sheer beauty of well-designed 
dance." 

McKayle, the company's ar-
tistic director, studied dance in 
New York with Martha Graham, 
and the New Dance Group, In 
laddition to working with the 
company, McKayle has done 
choreography for Broadway 
musicals, films, television and 
ballet companies, 

The troupe's March 8 per-
formance will begin at 8:30 P,M . 
Tickets for the performance, 
available at the UCSD box office,

ENDGAME 
Sam uel BemeU's drama, 

"Endgame," will open Tuesday, 
March 11, for fhe performances 
in the Recital Hal. of UCSD's new 
Mandeville Center for the Arts . 

The production was first 
presented at UCSD last Sep-
tember and is being revived ·as 
part of the 11-day opening 
festival of the arts for the 
Mandeville Center (March 6 
through 16) . 

"Endgame" will be presented at 
8 .30 pm March 11 and 13-15 and 
at noon on March 12. Director of 

the play is Dr. Michael Addison, 
UCSD associate professor of 
drama. 

The cast, which is the same as 
the original production, includes 
two UCSD students, Richard 
Revelli and Robyn Hunt, and two 
UC faculty members; Dr. Arthur 
Wagner, chairman of the UCSD 
Drama Department, and Dr. John 
D. Harrop, assistant professor of 
drama at UC Santa Barbara . 

"Endgame" has two main 
characters, Hamm and Clove, 
who have a master-servant 
relationship. The play deals with 
man's painful , perplex, frantic 

and even comic confrontation 
with death . 

"The play is usually treated as a 
somber philosophical exercise, 
full of dark broodings," according 
to Addison. " In our production 
we focus on the more immediate, 

. but no less meaningful, human 
relationships. We are seeking 
meaning in behavior that might 
be found in such places as a 
prison , an asyl 'um , a con-
certration camp or a terminal 
ward - all the places where 
humans do, in fact, play out their 
endgames. 

"Our production," he said, "has 
been influenced by the literary 
and philosoph ical richness of 

Beckett's art. But our sociological 
and psychological research also 
had an important impact on the 
final theatrical form ." 

The original UCSD production 
of "Endgame" was made possible 
by three grants which allowed the 
cast to dellote a full month to 
rehearsal last summer. 

Both Harrop and Wagner 
received University of California 
Creative Arts Institute grants and 
Addison received a grant from the 
Governor's Teaching Excellence 
Program that included funds for 
the students involved in the cast 
and production company.

sought out one of the eminent sages of the day and eo:pres,ed his 
desire. "Very well," said the sage, " but why did you bring all that 
baggage with ~u?" Bewil~red , the man looked around to see what 
the sage was referring to, bOt sa\V nothing but the pack on his back 

~ich might constitute baggage. The sage, seei~ the man in distress, 
finally said, "The baggage' ~u are carrying is in your minc;i . It is your 
eo:pectations and desires. You come looking for enl ightenment, but 
how will you know if you ever achieve it? What happens if it does not 
conform to ~ur ecpectations?" 

Thus everyone is advised to leave their "baggage" at the door for 
the UCSD Music Department's offeri ngs at the Mandeville Center this 
week . The variety eX musical €'IIents is "really astonishing," according 
to Pauline Oiveros, Associate Professor d Music at UCSD. 

"You can't make generalizations about 'modern ,,"usic'. Try to 
remember whatjt was like when you didn't have any judgment, any 
prejudices, when ~u were ready for anything." Thus armed--or is it 
disarmed?- people s~ould be ready for the great r1.Jmber of musical 
eo:periences bei ng Il'esented. 

The opening night performance is entitled "Stage Work by UCSD 
Composers" and consists of four works (see the full schedule 
elsewhere in these pages for dates and times) . " Hockshurr," by 
assistant professor Jean-Charles Francois, is a game piece for 30 
players. It is an action piece where the object d the game is to get 
through a maze, in this case an elaborate hop-scotch set . The players, 

~ng and old al ike, respond to light changes and the directions in 
each square to create movement. "It is activity at all l€'IIels; music-
making ~ich everyone can participate in," commented Ms:OIiveros. 

The next piece in this quartet is "My, My, My What a Wonderful 
Fall" by professor Kenneth Gaburo. This piece involves the 
movement of trained dancers "rediscovering the spontaneity of 
falling," according to Oliveros. 

Third is professor Robert Reynolds' " ... From Behind the 
Unreasoning Mask" in which three performers-a trombonist (Stua rt 
Dempster) and two percussionists-play through a unreasoning mask, 
in this case a four-channel tape, a symbol of technology. The players 
have to overcome the tape . 

Rounding out the quartet is associate professor Oliveros' ONn piece 
'Crow Two." It is a multi -faceted, very theatrical ceremonial opera . 
Almost everything in the piece is a form of meditation. The 
meditators meet q:>posing forces , in the form of two Crow Heyokas (a 
Sioux Indian word meaning "scared down") who try to distract them 
from their medi ~ations . Some of the meditations in the work are 
intriguing. Six fl ote players will be in the catwalks above the theater, 
and the audien( e is invited to influence the pi tches telepathically. 
There are mirror rreditations; even the lighting is a meditation-called 
Luminic Medit, tion--in which light is projected upward to an 
cw-rangement of ni rrors and then downward onto the performers. The 
Luminic Medital ;on i~ fToduc d by John Forkner . 

All four of the;e pieces will be presented together on opening night 
. and all are worl j premieres, except for Reynolds piece. The second 
night brings a performance of "The Bewitched" by the late Harry 
Partch. For those of you who missed this perfamance at San Diego 
State recently, a group of their musicians is bringing it to the Man-
deville Center for us " It is a dance-theater musical in which a group 
of ' lost' musicians wander onto a half-dark stage full of stange in-
strum nts and begin to play Through the exotic sound they 
momentarily find a direction and forget they are lost. An ancient 
Witch materializes and takes mmmand of the lost musicians and they 
then proceed to conjur up ten scenes of perceptive visions 
<,;}tirizing. through humor and farce , the human situation as we live 
It " 

Page 8 Triton Times March 5, 1975 

Perhaps one of the most interesting events wi II be the two-day 
exhibit of "MUSEUMS" (a full listing of these events accompanies 
this article) . Under the auspices of the Music Department and the 
Center for Music Experiment (CME), and directed by Kenneth 
Caburo, "MUSEUMS" is a multi-media presentation including tapes, 
films , slides, computer sound generation, biofeedback systems, video 
and video synthesis, light compositions and photographic displays. 

One of the "MUSEUM" presentations is "Bio-Thea'ter," which is "a 
sound/ light presentation using brain-waves, respiration, and other 
bio-potentials to mntrol an electronic music synthesizer and lighting 
display. The 'bio-performer' controls the environment bv altering his 
or her mental modes . The eo:perimental presentation is the result of 
research at UCSD under the auspices ci CIV1E by the SonicMeditations 
Research Group, whose concern are modes of the consciousness as 
related to composition and performance." 

. Another of the "MUSEUM" pieces is "Bulrs Eye-You are the 
Target," a film by AI Huang, with commentaries by none other than 
the late Alan Watts . It is a spoof on meditation Also on the program 
is "Atomic Cafe's Createst Hits", composed an8 performed by UCSD 
students. 

On March 10th, the Music Department presents "A Chamber 
Concert in Honor of Ernst Krenek," under the direction of Will 
Ogden . This concert wi II feature works by Arnold Schoenberg, Will 
Ogdon, Ernst Krenek and a theater piece for guitar bv Jean-Charles 
Francois. 

The big evening for fun and hilarity is March 12th, which bears the 
unassuming title d "Contemporary Vocal Mlsic." The UCSD Concert 
Gloir and Chamber Singers will perform "The Celestial Country" by 
Glarles Ives . Stuart Dempster talks through his trombone in "General 
Speech" by Robert Erickson . There is a performance of "Oh Ha Ah" 
by Pauline Oliveros. In .addition, the Extended Vocal Techniques 
Group of the Center for Music Experiment will present the world 
p-emiere of "The Owl and the Pussycat" by ucst> graduate student 
Deborah Kavasch . " If you don't roll in the aisles at this concert," 
warns Ms. Oliveros, "then ~u just haven't g>t a sense of humor." 

Tne UCSD Gospel Choir performs on the 13th under the direction of 
Cecil Lytle and featuring soloist Edwin Hawki ns, Concert pianist Gary 
Graffman performs on the 11th. On March 15th "Music for Larger 
Ensembles" will be presented. The UCSD Chamber Ensemble and the 
La Jolla Civic/University Symphony, under the direction of Thomas 
Nee, will perform two world premieres of works by UCSD Music 
faculty : "Concerto for Flutes and Chamber Orchestra" by Joseph 
Julian and "Rainbow Rising" by Robert Erickson. In addition to these 
world premieres, works by Will Ogdon and Loren Rush will be 
J:]"esented . 

This is only a partial list of the musical events begi nning this week. 
Everyone should consult the full listing in this issue and keep it for 
ready reference . Admission will be charged for the follOWing con-
certs: The Inner City Repertory Dance Company, Gary Graffman, 
UCSD Gospel Choir, "Stage Works by UCSD Composers", "The 
Bewitched" "A Chamber Concert in Honor of Ernst Krenek ," 
'Contemp~rary Vocal Music," and "Music fo'r Larger Enselbles." 

Ihis impressive array of contemporary music should have 
something for everyone. If ~u haven' t had a chance to experience 
"modern music," or if you haven't made up ~r mind about it yet, 
here is a great opportunity to immerse yourself in it. "You may not 
like what you hear," says Ms. Oliveros, "but it wi II hit you ." She 
recalled that her -first enq~unter ~lth ':'modern music" was the Bartok 
Spring Quartets in 1952. ~he was perple1led, not knowi ng how to feel 
about it, until she bought the album and played it about ten times in 
a row. She slowly became familiar with it. The point is that one 
should allow himself to be eo:posed to new and diHerent expressions 
befor forming an opinion. 

"rhe grants gave us the tiltH' to 
fully explore' the text of the play 
and the relationship to Beckett's 
other works and to sup-
plementary material from 
psychological and critical 
sources," Addison said. "We were 
able to experiment with multiple 
possibilities in performance terms 
and didn't have to make snap 
judgments or lock into quick and 
obvious performance qualities ." 

Tickets for all performances are 
51 .50 for students and 53 for the 
general public. They may be

Exhibit of Work of 30 Costume 
And Scene Designers March 6-16 

Since last August, Dan Dryden has been a very busy man. As assistant professor in the Drama 
pepart~ent and the residen.t designer at UCSD, Dryden has been co-ordinating a brilliant and 
mtere~un~ show for the openIng of the Mandeville Center for the Arts. 

Begmnmg March 6 and runfllng through March 1.6, an exhibit representing nearly thirty costume 
and scene,~lsign~rs will be on ~~play i~ the mai,n lobby of the. Mandev~lJe Center .• 'The purpose of 
the show, expl~med Dryden, IS.to bnng to thiS campus ~n Introductlon, an awtlreness , of scenic 
and costume deSign. Many people Just assume that everythmg on the stage JUSt happens; they don 't 
understand costumes and scenery are as much a pan of the theater as an actor learnmg his lines and 
a playwright writing a script." 

The show, which covers a seventy-year time period, is meant to display the innovations that have 
~eshape~ and elevate~ scenic co~tum!= designing. Dryden, who has travelJed to the Stratford Theater 
mOntano, The Guthne Theater m Mmocsota, and was awarded a grant in December to work in New 
York City contacting designers, is pleased with the final results of his efforts. ,. Some of the sketches 
that have been acquired. for the display are milestones in the theater. We have Oscar and Tony 

awar~ winners, as welJ as samples of some of the hottest young designers now working on Broad-
way. 

Included in the show entitled "Innovations: Then and Now" will be theatrical drawings and 
dc;signs of some 2 ~ of the country's foremost designers for professional and regional theatres . There 
WIIJ also be 1 ~ costume plates fro.m the Stratford Regional Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford, Ontario 
and a samplmg of costume deSIgns from the Stratford Theatre which are now part of the UCSD 
Drama Department collection. _ 

Accompanying the drawings will be a videotape about theatre design work featuring designer 
Tanya Moisoiwitsch . The 20-minute film will be shown continuously . 

According to Dan Dryden, resident designer for the UCSD Theatre, exhibits of scenic and costume 
design are rare despite the fact that many designers are excellent artists. 

"Through sketches designers relate their ideas to authors , directors and performers," Dryden 
said. "They are but a means to an end and not an end in themselves. 

"The designer rarely has the time to paint pretty pictures of his design or complete a stunning 
model. Sket~es are often ~over~d with data and mea.surements, splattered with scene paint and 
usually survive the productlon With frayed edges and npped corners. The sketches that survive are 
collected and catalogued in library vaults to serve the theatre historian and scholar. ' , 

Among the artists represented in the show will be pioneer scenic designers Edward Gordon Craig 
and Robert Edmond) ones who helped establish the foundations of theater design work. Included 
will be Craig's rendering of a scene for a 1911 production of "Romeo and)uliet" and)ones ' drawing 
of a scene for the original production (1934) of" Ah Wilderness" which starred George M . Cohan. 

Renderin"s by Academy and Tony Awards winner )0 Mielziner will include scenic drawings for 
"Winterset • (193~), "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn" (19~O), "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof ' (1954) and 
George Ballanchine's "Who Cares" (1970). 

Mielziner won the 1955 Academy Award for color art direction of the motion picture '·Picnic. " He 
has been associated with 300 major productions a~d has also won five Tony Awards, five Donaldson 
Awards and nine citations from the Variety Poll of Critics for his theatre design work. 

Renderings by American Conservatory Theatre costume designer Robert Morgan will include the 
ACT production (1973) of "House of Bemarda Alba," the Marin Shakespeare Festival 's production 
(1973) of "As You Like It" and the UC Santa Barbara production (1973) of "Caucasian Chalk Cir-
de." One of the theatre's current young costume designers, Morgan is m his third season with the 
ACT in San Francisco and has been active in many of the nation's regional Shakespeare festivals. 

Playwright, director and scene and costume designer Mordecai Gorelik will be represented by his 
renderin~ for • 'Born Yesterday," and "Vivi Mexico," photographs of his designs for 
"ProcessIOnal" and "Thunder Rod:" and a model of his designs for the New York City Theater 
Union production (1934) of "Sailors of Catta[o. " Gorelik was one of the leaders in the "new theatre" 
movement in the 1920s and 1930s. 

Donald Oenslager, a student of Robett Edmond/ones and former head of the design program in 
theatre at Yale University, has loaned renderings 0 his designs for "A Dramatization of the Book of 
Job," "Major Barbara" and .. Red, Hot and Blue.' ' 

A variety of scenic renderings and photographs will show the work of Henry May who has 
designed for the Metropolitan and San Francisco Operas. He also served as architectural consultant 
to the New York Philharmonic Orchestra for Lincoln Center's Philharmonic Hall and was executive 
art director for the • 'Omnibus" television series in the 1950s. May is currently the resident designer 
for the UC Berkeley Theatre Department. 

Phorofraphs and costume sketches showing designs by Peter Wexler for a new opera, "The 
Trojans, • will also be displayed. Wexler won a Tony Award for his designs for " Walking Happy" 
and is now redesigning the Hollywood Bowl. 

Douglas Russell, costume designer foc Stanford University , has loaned a number of his work 
including sketches for the Old Globe Theatre productions of "Measure for Measure" (1964), 
"Henry VIII" (1965) and "Richard III" (1972) . 

Another award-winning designer exhibiting in the show will be Patricia Zipprodt who has won 
Tony Awards for her costume designs for "Fiddler on the Roof' and "Cabaret" and the Drama 
Desk Award for her designs for "Pippin" and "Zorba." Costume sketches in the show will include 
"Cabaret," "Pippin," "1776" (movie) and "Waiting for Godot. " 

"Designing for the theatre is such a collaborative an; no scene or costume will stand on its own; 
we need the stage, the actor, the audience ... " Dryden's drom have produced an artistic display of 
mapificeot and unique talent. In the husde and busde of the Man(Jevilk Center opening, don',

Pianist Graffman Will 
- Perform Here Tuesday 
On Tuesday, March 11, as part 

of the eleven day culture festival 
commemorating the openina of 
the Mandeville Center, pianist 
Gary Graffman will be presented 
in concert. Althoulh GraHman is 
known as a master of Roman-
ticism, his program will include 
works by Mozart, Beethoven, 
Ravel, and Moussorgsky. 

Whenever discussinl the 
relative talents of living piano 
virtuosi, the name of Cary 
Graffman mU5t certainly be 
mentioned . GraHman, 46, is still 
considered a young pianist, even 
though 1975 marks his 27th year 
of professional performance. 

Graffman's road to success 
started in 1938 when, at the age 
of ten, he was accepted into 
Philadelphia's Curtis Institute 9f 
/v\Jsic . At the Curtis Institute he 
studied under the late Isabelle 
Vengerova unti I his official debut 
with the Philadelphia Orchestra 
under Eugene Ormandy in 1947. 
A year later he appeared in a 
Carnegie Hall recital as recipient 
of the Speciitl Award of the Rach-
maninoff Fund. In 1949 Graffman 
won the award that he is 5till the 
most proud of, the exhaulted 
Leventritt Award. The next year 
was spent by Graffman in Europe 
as the winner of the Fulbright 
Award, But, this was only the 
beginning, for in 1951, Graffman 
began years of intense study 
under both Vladimir Horowitz 
and Rudolf Serkin. These years of 
study reached a fitting 
culmination in 1967 when 
Graffman gave the world premier 
performance to Benjami n Lees' 
C01lcerto . No.2, a concerto 
dedicated to Craffman, with Erich 
Leinsdorf and the Bostom 
Symphony. 
. Graffman's world wide tours 
often average over 100 concerts 
and recitals a year. In the United 
States, Graffman has performed 
under the batons of Eugene 
Ormandy, George Szell, Leonard 
Bernstein, Erich Leinsdorf, 
Charles Munch, Leopold 
Stokowski, and Otto Klemperer. 
Graffman is the ooly artist to have 
recorded with six of America's 
leading or,:hestras; New York, 
Philadelphia, Boston, Cleveland, 
OIicago, and ' San Francisco. 
Graffman, long since renown as a 
concert and solo pianist has 
recently expanded into the study 
of chamber music. In recent years 
he has performed with the 
Guarneri and Tokyo string 

-. o 
f 

quartets, cellist Leonard Rose, 
violinist Berl Senofsky, flautist 
Jean-Pierre Rampal, .-KI others. 

GraHman's prolram on March 
11 contains Mo.rart 's 50,,"/4 i,,·P 
Miljor, K. 332, Beethoven's. 
SoNllil No. 32;" C ",",or, Op. 
111, Ravel's 5oNl/r;,e, and 
Moussorgslty's popular Piclllr,s 
fro", "" Exhibilio". Mozart 
presents a challenge to the 
technical mastery of the most 
accomplished pianist. A well 
performed rendition of Mozart is 
always the sign of a great 
musician . The .vozart' So""I" is a 
fine example of the classicist 
ideas prevelant' in all of Mozart's 
works. It consists of the symetric 
I-V-I moduation . involved in the 
typical classic Sonata . The 
Beethoven 50,,"1" provides a 
lively antithesis to the .voz.rt. 
The last composed of 
Beethoven's sonatas, it abandons 

Gary Gr"jjma" 
the classic form in favor of two 
unequal movements of great 
contrast, It opens with an in-
troductory Maestoso which 
proceeds to develop the entire 
movement from a single theme. 
The Arrietta follows with a simple 
theme with four variations ending 
in an epilogue. Ravel's So,,"tme 
covers the gap between the. first 
two Sonatas. The piece is an 
agreeable combination of the 
classic structure and modern 
harmonies. It is composed of 
contrasts between a meloncholy 
.Modere, a tender Minuet and a 
sparkling Anime finale. piclllres

Realjpn . 
Artist O'Doherty to L~cture 

'Sen e of Reference' 
The exhibition in the new 

Mandellille Art Callery, March 7-
16, entitled "~ense of Reference", 
will prOllide n Ollerall survey of 
contemporary art focusing on the 
theme of Real ism. 

The art historical term 
"Realism" originated in the 19th 
Century and centered on the work 
of Gustave Courbet, although 
obviously the concept itself is 
ancient. In the 1960's, both Pop 
and Minimalism lay claims to 
realism and literalism, but from 
our current perspective, both 
mOllements seem to halle been 
more concerned with abstraction . 

works by Nancy Holt, Hans 
Haacke, Robert Smithson and 
Christo. These pieces will be 
documented by photographs, 
drawings, films and videotapes . 

Two of the films, Christo's 
"Valley Curtain" and Smithson's 
"Spiral Jetty," will be shown at 
7:30 p,m. March 10, 11 and 13 in 
room 2250 of the Humanities & 
Social Sciences Building on the 
Muir College campus. 

Also included in the show will 
be a photographic piece by Alice 
Aycock, a graphite drawing and 
an acrylic by Laurence Dreiband, 
a film image on paper by Jo 

:~anson, a drawing-
documentation by Ralph Reed 
and a color lithograph by Ed 
Ruscha. Other pieces will include 

Brian O'Doherty, artist, lecturer 
and current director of the visual 
arts program for the National 
Endowment for the Arts, will give 
two public lectures at UCSD's 
Mandeville Center for the Arts. 

O'Doherty, a SCUlptor who 
creates his art work under the 
name of Patrick Ireland, will 
lecture at 4:00 {lm Tuesday, 
March 11, in the Mandeville 
Recital Hall on the topic, "Words 
Without Pictures ." His second 
lecture, titled "The Definition of a 
Modernist Space : The Art 
Gallery," is scheduled for 7:00 pm 
Wednesday, March 12, in the 
Mandellille auditorium . Both 
lectures are free and open to the 
public .

Kenneth Price, color photographs something of a free spirit who has

Robert Morris . 

his birth date. 
He is the author of three books 

dealing with art and has con-
tributed chapters or served as 
editor of several others. He has 
written essays and articles for 
such publications as the New 

, York Times Book Review, the Yale 
Review, Evergreen Review, life, 
Newsweek, the London Times, 
Dublin Magazine, and Irish 
Monthly. He served as art critic 
for the New York Times from 1961 
to 1964. 

O'Doherty has lectured at art 
galleries and art museums 
throughout the United States and 
has served as a lIisiting professor 
at UC Berkeley and as an adjunct 
professor at Barnard College. He 
served as a consultant to the 
Smithsonian Institution from 
1%6 to 1968 and is currently a 
member of the acquisitions 
committee of the Mirshhorn 
Museum in Washington . He was 
awarded the Eire Society of 
Boston Gold Medal -in 1963 and 
the Mather Award of the College 

Art Association for "excellence in 
art criticism" in 1969. 

As Ireland, the artist has had 
eight one-1nan shows including a 
showing of large rope drawings at 
the Los Angeles County Museum 
of Art during February. His work 
has been included in numerous 
group shows and in reviews and 
catalogs. 

His dual identity can be related 
to what has been described as a 
kind of ongoing performance 
piece, based on the belief that 
each of ..us is inhabited by more 
than one persona, and that it is 
b.1sically anti-humanistic to 
expect oneself or others to 
conform to a single mode of 
behavior or personality set. 

According to the artist, the 
Patrick Ireland persona represents 
a moral stance with regard to the 
Iri sh struggle and will be 
maintained until such time as 
British military forces have left 
Ireland and liberty and freedom 
halle been restored to the Irish 
people. 

Since the end of the 1960's, 
there has been a renewed and 
lIigorous interest in realism which 
has manifested itself if} painti ng, 
scu Ipture, performance and 
conceptual art . One direction of 
th is interest has been to create 
c lose approximations to the 
physical appearance of objects in 
the "real world ." One of the 
major trends in contemporary 
painting, Super Realism or Photo-
Realism, concerns itself with 
large scale, highly precise ren-
dering of such subjects as street 
scenes, portraits, Interiors and 
co llections of objects. Examples 
of this genre in the show will 
include Shirley Pettibone, Ralph 
Goings, Douglas Bond and Robert 
Cottingham. 

Three films ("Hand Held Day," 
" Pasadena Freeway Stills" and 
"Mirror") by Gary Beydler will be 
shown along with a lIideotape of 
drawings by Julie Geiger. 

.Edwin Hawkins to ?erform Thursday 
With Gospel Choir ('Oh, Happy Day? 

Much of contemporary 
sculp ture explores another 
direction . It enters a dialogue 
wit the sociological-ecological-
politICal systems that also make 
up the " real world," Sometimes 
these pieces are conceilled on 
purely a conceptual lellel and 
th reforeexist only'in the form of 
notes, plans, and drawings. In 
other Instances artists halle 
ca med out their plans, and 
drawings In other instances 
artists have carried out their plans 
in ItU, often in the form of Earth-
works. Examples of these ex-
plorations in the show wi II be 

American, Canadian and 
Japanese films and lIideo tapes 
will also be included. A lIiewing 
schedule will be available in the 
Mandellille Art Gallery. One of 
the more controversial pieces in 
the show will be a photo 
documentation by Haacke, 
"Shapolsky et al Manhattan Real 
Estate Holdings : A Real Time 
Social System as of September 1, 
1972." The work, an inllestigation 
into real estate dealings, was 
pulled out of an exhibit in the 
Guggenheim Museum, 

Ca llery hours will be 12-9 pm 
daily. The schedule of film and 
tape showings will be allailabl~ 
from the gallery at a later date.

Edwin Hawkins, an outstanding 
popular Gospel singer, will be the 
featured vocalist performing with 
the UCSD Gospel Choir in the 
Main Auditorium of the Man-
deville Center on Thursday, 
March 13 at 8:30 pm . 

Hawkins belongs to that small 
fraternity of artists who, with a 
single record (in this case literally 
a single) made musical history . 
The 1968, million-selling, 
Grammy Award winning, gospel 
song, "Oh Happy Day," written 
and arranged by Edwin Hawkins 
and performed by The Edwin 
Hawkins Singers, is one of those 
m mories guaranteed to bring q 
smile of remembered joy. And the 
story of its success, how two plays 
on KSAN, San Francisco's un-
derground FM station, succeeded 
in laun ching the song to 
nationwide success is the sort of 
tale that record company 
presidents tell themseilies on co ld 
winter evenings without stars (or 
ellen bullets), just to prOlle that it 
un happen.' 

In the years since that time 
Hawkins and his group of singers 
and musicians have remained 
committed to the spirit of Gospel 
music . But as Hawkins and the 
rest of the musical community 
have discollered, this sort of 
music has wide popular appeal, 
and lends itself to expression in a . 
contemporary lIein . During a 
recent visit to New York City from ' 
his home in Oakland, California, 
Hawkins expressed his conlliction 
that "The public can appreciate 
my work as beautiful music, and 
can accept it without category ." 

His most recent offering is an 
electrifying album recorded live 
at the Bitter End, New York . The 
album introduces the dynamic 
performance of the new st 
mE'mber of th group, Edwin's 
youngest Sister, Lynette. I n ad-
dition to hE'r gutsy sou lful ound, 
she adds an immeasurable 
amount of stage pre ence to the 

~how . IOSlOg With Edwin and 
Lynette are their two COUSins, 
JE'an Kt.O.g, hlrley MiliN and 

tenor Donald Henderson. Edwin 's 
brother Daniel leads the musicans 
on keyboard with Carl Lockett on 
guitar, Bobby Cochran on drums, 
and Anthony Mitchell on bass . 

The album offers a lIariety of 
"gospel oul" from the classic 
"Oh Happy Day" to the spirit 
filled Stevie Wonder song " Jesus 
Chi ldren of America ." 

Born and bred in Oakland, 
Hawkin is one of seven brothers 
California tor the 1967 Annual 

Youth Congress of Church of God 
in Christ, held in Washington, 
D.C. 

In May 1968, Hawkins and his 
group recorded an lP, Let Us Go 
Into the House of The Lord, for 
the 1968 Annual Youth Congress 
in Cleveland. In addition to 
playing piano, Hawkins arranged, 
conducted and wrote the songs 
on the album, one of which was 
the incredible, "Oh Happy 

Edwin Haw~i"s 

al'ld sisters whose family life was 
rich with music. With no formal 
training Hawkins 'became an 
accomplished pianist on the old 
upright in the parlor. 

With a laugh, Edwin recalls : " I 
played it so much I used to drive 
my poor moth~r wild . 'Get off of 
that piano! ' she used to say . But 
she always did encourage me to 
pursue music. So did my father . 
They just wanted us- all the kids-
to be happy doing what we were 
doing." 

Hawkins form d his unique 
Singing group (formerly known as 
the NorthNn California State 
Youth Choir) from choir member 
of Pente osta l churc h E'~ in 
HerkE'ley. an f ranliSCO, 
Oakland, an J o~e and Richmond, 

Day" ... and thus it all began. 
In recent months, the group 

has been playing very suc-
cessfu lly for club, college and 
concert audiences. One of their 
more unusual dates, the Con-
tinental Baths in New York City, 
confirmed the warmth of public 
response, clamorous applause 
and demands for encores, such as 
they have come to enjoy 
whenever they play. Entering the 
mainstream of contemporary 
music, Hawkins is quite aware of 
other contemporary acts and 
it s Glady Knight & The Pips, AI 

Green and the O'Jays among his 
f ~lIoritE's

Poets Rich, Miles Will Read During Opening 
his friend Victor Hartman: It 
consists of musical discriptions of 
various paintings separated by 
promenades which in the words 
of Moussorgsky, "the composer 
portrays himself walking "my 
right , now left, now as an idle 
person, now urged to go !lear a 
picture." 

With a pianist such as Gary 
Graffman performing these out-

~anding works, everyone in-
terested in music should indeed 
avail themselves of the op-
portunity. Craffman will be 
performing Tuesday, March 11 at 
8:30 in the Mandeville Center.

A dedicalion ceremony for

precede the Performances. 

Two outstanding American 
poets will give readings of their 
work as part of the 11-day 
opening festival for the Man-
deville Center for the Arts. 

Andrienne Rich will read at 4 
pm Monday, March 10, in the 
center's Recital Hall. Josephine 
Miles will deliver a poem 
commissioned for the Mandeville 
festival at 4 pm Friday, March 14, 
.also in the Recital Hall. 

Both programs are free and 
open to the public 

Rich won the Yale University 
Press annual competition for 
beginning poets with her first 
book, "A Change of World," ~en 
she \l\8S 22. 

Her early poetry used fixed 
metrical forms and the views she 
ecpressed were e)(istentiaJ . She 
publ ished in the "Nation," 
"Harper's," "The New York 
Review of Books" and "New 
Republic," travelled abroad and 
translated poetry from several 
foreign languages. 

In her third book, "Snapshots 
cJ a Daughter-i~Law" (1963), she 
abandoned rhyme and con-

~ntional meter. The change in 
style has been accentuated by her 
involvement in radrcal politics in 
recent years. Many of her current 
PJems explore the theme of 
ft!vulsion "'om traditional cultural 
and social values . 

Her published verse includes 
"The Diamond Cutters," 
"Necessities of Life," "Selected 
Poems" and "Leaflets ." Her 
IX)etry appears in the anthologies 
"Contemporary American Poetry" 
(1962); "A Controversy of Poets" 
iIld "Poems of <A.lr Moment." 

Rich, 45, was born in Baltimore 
iIld received a bachelor of arts 
cEgree from Radcliffe College in 
1951 . She has taught at 5wartn-
more College, Columbia 
University and the City College in 
New York . 

She has won two Guggenheim 
Fellowships, the American In-
!titute of Arts and Letters Award 
br poetry and the Bollingen 
foundation commission for 
translation IX IAItch poetry. 

Currently she lives in New York 
City. 

For those who do not know 
~sephine Miles, she is an ex-
reptional woman . 

As poet, her ten volumes of 
p:letry halle received enthusiastic 
iIld critical appreciation, and 
iM'ards including the prestigious 
Guggenheim Fellowship, the 
91elley Memorial Award for 
!betry, the Phelam Fellowship 
iIld a National Endowment for 
!'betry. 

As academician, she has taught 
it UC Berkeley for the past thirty 

~ars, is one of the eight pan 
University of Cal ifornia 

professors , has contributed 
significant work in the field of 
~ylistics, and has collaborated 
with Mark Schorer and Gorden 
Makenzie in roiting Crilicism,the 
FOllndations of Modern Literary 
Jlldgement, 

She is a poet who has found 
happiness and fulfillment as a 
reacher, a poet who has en-
rouraged stu'dents to attempt 
imaginative writing and to seek 
experiences rourageously . 

" It is vital for new writers to 
recognize the best teacher of all-

ecpetience. Have them. Make 
them . Encounter them The true 

~iter must neller be afraid to try 
new ventures, aim for new 
rorizons, break with the old 
traditions. And such persons can't 
be afraid to write about such 
ecperiences," ~ated Miss Miles in 
the NOllember, 1974 issue of 
Weslways. 

And, as the poem below' 
Ilustrates, Josephine Miles writes 
with the gift of a true teacher 
herself; one who is willing, and 
\'tho can share a wide spectrum of

Portrait of the Artist 

Being a paper blown inlo Ihe streel, 
Pn'nted upon, read somewhat, 
I stir with a delight in sOllnd, 
Finding cement a cool resh'"gplace, 

To the bille shadows of the trees nobody cries, 
" Get liP Ollt of the streets, play on Ihe porch!" 
Nobody pids the sllnlight off the cllrb 
Feari"g 10 /ind it bro~en by rubber lires, 

Li~e these I taie comfort iff while paveme"t; 
More than these I ca" be callghl by Ihe wind, 
Borne down hiils, corner rollnd corner, liP roofs ellen, 
Torn, tom by the long drag of the streets. 

More than these, thollgh 10m and eventllally lost, 
I have a body to be ca'lIght by. the 1f'ind, . 
CUriOIlS, nerved, aware of cnsp d,mens,on , 
On all these streets the /rIIest traveler,
