Warren provost steps 
down after 10 years 
By MARNmE FEDERIS 

Associate News Editor 

David Jordan announced Nov. 
5 his decision to step down after 
ten years as Earl vVarren College 
provo t. Jordan's re ignation will 
be effective at the end of the aC3-
demic year on June 30. 

According to Jordan, hi deci-
sion to resign was made in order 
to allow omeone else the oppor-
runity to take on the position. 

"It' been tremendously good 
fun for 10 year , and rewarding as 
well," Jordan said . "1 did my 10 
years; it' omebody el e's turn. 
I've been here si nce 1969 and you 
begin to think about retirement 
and whether to wait for a whole 
five years to pull out . . . it just 
eemed wiser." 

lIe plans to rerurn and teach 
a few courses in the anthropology 
department. 

"Provosts have vcry little time 
to teach, but I guess there's some-
thing in trying to simplify things 
and make them learnable," 
Jordan said . "It's nice to see 

omebody discover something 
that eems new." 

Jordan became provost in 

1994 after being part of the 
anthropology department since 
1969. He first came to the univer-
sity as an assistant professor and 
was part of the founding faculty 
for the department. 

Responsibilities as provost 
included providing programs and 
ensuring their efficiency. 

"I enjoy the orientation, 
advertising the campus to new 
people," Jordan aid. "The orien-
tations we put on are really 
impressively coordinated and it's 
that sort of public performance 
of the university that I really 
like." 

As provo t, Jordan also over-
saw several academic programs 
that have grown and diminished 
over the past 10 year . One of 
programs which he actively sup-
ported was the development of a 
discussion class for foreign lan-
guage Iiterarure srudents. Other 
programs that have grown during 
Jordan'S administration include 
the Academic Internship Program 
and the development of the 
Health Care ocial Issues and 
Law and ociety minors.

City to study living wage 
Council decides to investigate proposal 

By CHRlmNE KWON 
Staff Writer 

Proponents of a living wage for 
San Diego workers rmde headway 
when the Rules Comminee of the 
San Diego City Council unanimous-
ly approved further investigation of 
the Responsible Wage and Health 
Care Benefits Ordinance on Nov. 5. 

The deci ion was made after the 
rules comminee heard the input of 
around 50 San Diego citizens, work-
ers and students gathered at City 
Hall. The meeting, which drew hun-
dreds of living wage supporters and 
opponents, featured a presentation 
of the Responsible Wage and He.alth 
Care Benefits Ordinance, common-
ly known as the living wage ordi-
nance, before Mayor Dick Murphy 
and a board of council members.

porter ' filled the seats of the assem-
bly room with srudents and workers, 
as well as ministers and priests hold-
ing open Bibles on their laps and 
quoting scripture on their turn to 
speak. 

Donald Cohen, president of the 
Center on Policy Initiatives, the 
main organization behind the living 
wage ordinance, began the meeting 
with a detailed presentation of the 
mandate's goals, stipulations and 
potential effects on an Diegans and 
the economy. The £Ioor was then

Article finds race not fador in admissions 
UC scrutinized for possible 'back.,door' affirmative action 

Provost: 
Warren to 

search for new 
leadership By GAILLE FAURE News Editor 

A Los Angeles Tim es analysis of 
the University of California has 
found that race was not a factor 
overall in its admissions process, 
according to a Nov. 3 article. 

The analysis concluded that 
underrepresented groups on UC 
campuses are admitted with 
below-average test scores at the 
same rates as whites and Asians. 
Latinos with below-average S.A.T. 
scores were admitted at "only 
slightly" higher rates than whites 
and Asians, and blacks with below-
average scores were significantly 
less likely to get in. 

"These findings suggest that 
the UC adrnissions are on track," 
UC spokesman Hanan Ei senman 
said. "It also shows that we are 
drawing from the full range of 
UC-e ligible students, and that 
seems desirable from an instiru-
tion such as the University of 
California. Our srudies show that 
once they enroll at a campus, by 
and large the e students succeed in 
their studies. " 

This article follows an earlier 
TI71Iu article revealing UC Board 
of Regellt Chair John Moores ' 
preliminary report on UC admis-
sions. Moores ' report, which 
looked at SAT. orcs of admits 
at UC Berkeley, accused the uni-
versi ty of turning away students 
with high test score while admit-
ting others with S.A.T. scores 
below 1,000, and prompted the 
UC Regems to order a systemwide 
review of admissions. 

The San Diego UTlion-Tribune 
followed in the growing contro-

versy by publishing an article scru -
tinizing UCSD admi ts on Oct. 26. 
The drticle reported that 58 per-
cent of UCSD srudents admitted 
in 2002 with SA.T. scores under 
1,000 were underrepresen ted 
minorities. 

While the recem scrutiny of 
UC admissions raised questions 
about possible "back-door" affir-
mative action in the university'S 
rwo-year-old comprehensive 
review admission process, which 
looks at a wide variety of factors 
including grades, service, personal 
hardship and first-generation col-
lege attendance, the latest TImes 
article provided evidence that the 
University of California's claim 
that race and ethnicity were not 
factors in the admissions process. 

The publication ' analysis of 
UC admi ssions data stated that 
taken together, snldents applying 
in 2002 and 2003 with S.A.T. 
scores below 1,000 who best cate-
gorize them elves as black, Latino 
or Native American were equally 
likely to be admitted as those cate-
gorized as Asian or Caucasian. 
The admission rate for both 
groups was 63 percent. 

It also found that 67 percent of 
Latinos with scores under 1,000 
were admitted to one of the UC 
campuses, compared to 65 percent 
of Asia ns, 60 percent of 
Caucasians and 49 percent of black 
applicants. 

However, the anal ysis also 
showed that the numbers differed 
for the UC system's rwo most 
competitive universities. It report-
ed that Latinos and blacks were 
rwice as likely to be accepted than 
Caucasians and Asians at UC 

Berkeley, and a quarte r more like-
ly at UCLA. Berkeley accepted 
only 8 percent and U LA 7 per-
cent of all applicants with SAT.s 
under 1,000. 

At UCSD, data provided by the 
Office of Admissions about in-
state applicants for the class of fall 
2002 showed results differing 
frorn both the overall Times con-
clusion that the UC sys tem 
accepted all applicants at similar 
rates and its findings regarding the 
most competitive schools. In 
UCSD's case, admissions of stu-
dents with low SA.T. scores went 
in a different order altogether with 
the highest acceptance rate going 
to Latinos, followed in order by 
Asians, blacks and Caucasians. 

Latinos with scores below 
1,000 were accepted at a rate of 23 
percent, Asians at 17 percent, 
African Americans at 12 percent 
and Caucasians at nearly 9 per-
cent. 

However, appli cants scoring 
under 1,000 represented jus t 
under 4,000 ca ndida tes, a small 
portion of the 36 ,000-plus in-
state applicants for fall 2002 . 

The grade point average of sru-
dents admitted with scores under 
1,000 averaged 3.86, while those 
with scores over 1,400 that were 
not admitted had an average CPA 
oD .3B. 

Director of Admissions and 
Relations with Schools Mae 
Brown said that readers are pro-
hibited by state law from looking 
at race or ethnicity, that students 
with low scores are rejected across 
the board and that S.A.T.s are just 
one of a number of factors includ-
ed in comprehensive review. 

Following the publication of 
the UniOl1-Tribunt article, Brown 
also said she wclcomed the UC 
Regents ' study of systemwide 
admissi ons processes. 

"I think that if we reach a poi nt 
after this review and there's some-
thing to correct in the comprehen-
sive review policy, then by all 
means 1 think that should be 
done," Brown said . "I think that as 
a research and teaching institu-
tion, we're constantly reevalutat-
ing. " 

Eisenman felt that the Times 
study was accurate yet "troubling" 
in its focus on S A.T. I scores, 
which UC admissions rank behind 
CPA and SA T. n scores in terms 
of importance in evaluating appli -
cants. 

"It focuses solely on the S.A.T. 
I scores, which has been deter-
mined to be a fl awed measure-
ment," Eisenman said. "That's 
why UC faculty have weighed 
other factors rnore heavi ly and 
why the College Board is revamp-
ing the exam." 

Eisenman said the university 
was also concerned by the sugges-
tion that a particular group of stu-
dents would be "deemed unwor-
thy" of a UC education. 

"These students have achieved 
high grades in rigorous high 
school courses and would not have 
been admitted otherwise," he said. 

UC Regent Ward Conneri y, 
author of the recently defeated 
Prop. 54 and a vocal critic of any 
use of race or ethnicity in admis-
sions processes, issued a press 
release on Oct. 27 stating that he 

See ETHNICITY, page B 

continued fTom page I 
"Warren has been stable and 

has been growing. ... everyone 
loves Warren," Jordan said. "These 
programs have been goi ng on ince 
I ca me i nro office and have 
received good fi nancial support 
from the administration." 

With J ordan annou ncing his 
resignation, the Office of 
Academic Affairs wi ll conduct a 
campuswide search for a new 
provost. 

According to Jordan, he antici-
pates that a search committee con-
sisti ng of student, staff and faculty 
representatives will be formed to 
make recommendations in select-
ing the nelCt provo t. 

Accordi ng to Warren Resident 
Dean Clai re Palmer, there is a con-
cern for ensuring that students and 
staff members will be involved in 
the selection process. 

"We're nervous about who we 
get next," Palmer said. "Staff and 
srudents need to have input in the 
process. " 

For some, Jordan's announce-
ment came a a shock. According 
to Palmer, J ordan has always made 
himself ava ilable and has always 
been supportive of programs from 
the Residential Life office. 

"The resignation threw me off, 
and in te r ms of the grieving 
process, we're all in denial," 
Palmer said. "He's a wonderful 
leader fo r our college. He's a leg-
end, probab ly one of the founding 
fa thers of UCSD. He's absolutely 
wonderful , extremely brilliant. 
he can't be replaced."

UCSD must take 
action to retain Latinos 

A report card recentll released by UCSD s Chicano/Latino 
Concilio found that Latino 
students and staff find a hos-
tile on-campus environment 
and admini trators who 
ignore their academic needs. 

The percentage of 
Latinos enrolled as fresh-
men has remained at 
approxima tely 10 percent 
over the last five years, 
although Latinos make up 
more than 30 percent of 
parts of an Diego County. 

But the concerns of 
Latino enrollment numbers 
should not be seen as a .~rob­
lem that is limited to UCSD. 
Although in a school with a 
surrounding community 
that has a large Larina popu-
lation, the small number of 
Latinos in college is a more 
glaring problem. The low 
graduation rate among 
Latinos is a nationwide 
issue. Across the country, 
retention rates have been 
lower for Latinos due to 

lower economic resources, 
sociologists say. But the fact 
that cliis is a nationwide 
problem shouldn't prevent 
UCSD from actively 
attempting to remedy the 
simation. 

Before changes can be 
made, the (lroblem ha to be 
understood and research 
must be conducted. 

This report card probably 
came as no surprise to 
Latino students. At least this 
repo.ft. in~icat~s th~t the 
administration IS trymg to 
understand the concerns of a 
specific campus community. 

The survey is positive in 
that it shows a genuine 
interest on behalf of the 
administration to under-
stand the feelings ofUCSD's 
Latino commwllty Hopefully, 
that concern Will translate 
into ~ response. that gener-
ates incorporation of more 
Latino-related issues into 
the curriculum and a faculty 
more able to address the 
Latino populations needs. 

End of Ralphs picketing 
helps consumers 

Consolidating protes-tors on ct. 3 1, the United Food and 
Commercial Workers 
union strategically ordered 
I eked-out Ralph grocery 
store employees to rein-
force the picket lines in 
front of ons and 
Al berstons. This action 
increa ed customer conve-
nience and union bargain-
ing power and eliminate 
the hypocrisy of directing 
shoppen to non unionized 
grocery stores. 

By moving picketers 
from Ralphs - thus far, 
the most union-friendly 
chain - FCW has given 
customers a orely mi sed 
convenience. onsumers' 
choices were to either 
avoid the chains altogether 
and hop elsewhere or to 
cross the picket lines amid 
the calls and chants of pro-
testor . With Ralphs open 
to consumers, hopper ' can 
purcha e in peace. 

UFCW augmented its 
bargaining control by clev-

erly merging the picketers 
to divide the chams. This 

~pened only Ralphs to the 
flow of customers. 
Albertsons and Vons gro-
cery ales will continue to 
uffer while shoppers clog 

Ralphs for proviSIons, lop-
idedly boo ting sales. 

Uniting the picketers 
benefits UFCW. Instead of 
directing shoppers to 
nonunionized, alternative 
grocery stores, it give con-
sumers the option to shop 
at Ralphs. The strike could 
potentially la t until May 
2004, and FCW can 
guide shoppers to one of its 
own store and not 10 e 
future ale . 

UF W has deftly itu-
ated itself in the bargain-
ing process, increasing its 
own power and allowing 
con umers to fully acce s 
one tore. It i a smart 
repo!;itioning in the highly 
politicized bargaining 
proce and will only bene-
fit the union as the strike 
marche on.

Anti-porn week is paternalist 
Adults' civil liberties will suffer 

By CLAIRE J. VANNETTE 
Senior Staff Writer 

Citizens of the United States, 
take a moment out of your day 
today to thank President George 
W. Bush for his concern for your 
psychological, piritual and 
romantic well-being. Jr was out of 
Bush' deep desire to ensure that 
we are all happy and healthy that 
he declared Oct. 26 through ov. 
I to be Protection From 
Pornography Week_ Didn't you 
feel afer? 

You probably didn't know 
about it. Dunng a week in which 
Southern California burned and 
the Middle East smoldered, major 
publications weren't imere ted in 
Protection From Pornography 
Week and Americans had more 
pres ing threats on their nunds. 
The only coverage it received was 
smirkjng blog mentions and 
glowing pTai e fr m conservative 
religiou orgafllzati n . 
Neverlhel , thi was an official 
White Hou e proclamation, 
made the allle way that National 
Alzheimer's Di ea e Awarene 
Month ovember) and National 
P.O.W.lMlA Day (Sept. 19) were 
announced thi year. 

"Pornography an have debili-
tating effects on communitie , 
marriages, families and chjldren," 
the proclamation reads. "During 
Protection From Pornography 
Week, we commit to take steps to 
confront the dangers of pornog-
raphy." It continues to identify 
children as the principal victims 
of "pernicious" pornography. It 
mentions the Protect Act of April 
2003, which admirably tOughens 
penalties for those who make and 
distribute clUld pornography and 
encourages states to e tabli h 
Amber Alert systems. [t also plug 
the recently created Dot Kid~ 
domain, a cute idea that has yet to 
take off. 

The bulk of the proclamation 
uggestS that Bush is merely try-

ing to protect children from 
being depicted in and expo ed to 
pornography, and one can hardly 
criticiu hIm for thac. No one 
want kid stumbling aero 
explicit Web ile or movie, and 
monitoring children' televi ion 
viewlllg an~ Web surfing can 
eem daunting to parents, some 

of whom under tandably appeal 
to the federal government for 
help. 

J t would be overlcill to thunder 

indignantly about the time the 
Bush administration is wa ting 
with the e proclamations, as some 
have done. In all likelihood, they 
are cooked up by the bottom tier 
of his staff and Bush is only 
momentarily briefed before sign-
ing them into national record . 

Perhaps the main use of the 
proclamation is poli tical. It serves 
to court the religious right - a 
tiny minority who nonetheless 
has held political sway in the 
Republican party since the 1980 
pre idential election - while 
sllnultaneously oothing more 
moderate conservative ' and cen-
trists with comfortable, legally 
meaningle s platirudes about "the 
dangers of pornography." I [andy 
in the face of an oncoming elec-
tion, these "proclamation" are a 
great w y to appear to care about 
an is ue without having to delve 
into specific . 

The seemingly innocuous 
effects 0 Protection From 
Pornography Week houldn't mask 
its true intent: The Bush adminis-
tration' larger crusade again t 
pornography that feature and 
caters to adults.

TIIURSDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 2003 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

I LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Defense of Malaysian 
PM was reprehensible 
Editor: 

Attempting to find a shred of 
constructive advice or worthwhile 
reasoning in the recent anti-
Semitic rant of Malaysia's prime 
minister is nearly as futile as invit-
ing Osama bin Laden for a tour of 
Ground Zero. What Taha A. 
Gaya failed to comprehend in hiS 
Nov. 3 letter to the editor is that 
no matter what optimistic spin 
one puts on the paranoid, ultra-
reactionary tirade of this notori-
ous Jew-hater, the facts still 
remain the same: Mahalhir 
Mohamad has removed the taboo 
on organizationa l anti-SenUtism 
and has succeeded in perpetuating 
one of the greate t hateful con-
spiracy theories of all time - the 
myth of Jewish control of the 
world. 

The most alarming aspect of 
Gaya's letter is the fact that the 
myth of Jews "ruling the world by 
proxy" is never denied, but rather 
acknowledged 3S a lesson in con-
solidating international power of 
Muslim leaders and dictators 
around the world. Unfortunately, 
there is no lesson to be learned 
from uch a myth, nor does it 
crve anyone's purpo e to perpet-

uate it. This myth originated in 
Eastern Europe during the early 
20th century, where it was used to 
scapegoat Jews for dire political 
inlations, and propagate anti-
emitism in the ill-famed hoax 

publication entitled "The 
Protocols of the Learned Elders 
of Zion. II This forgery, and the 
slurs therein, was later quoted by 
noted anti-Semites including 
Ilenry Ford (author of "The 
International Jew: the World's 
Foremost Problem"), dolf 
Hjtler, and now, more candidly, 
Mahathir Mohamad. 

It doesn't rake a genius, and 
apparently not a UCSD alum-
nu , to figure out that any public 
figure who directly allude to 
such flagrantly racist propaganda 
isn't trying to offer creative 
advice to the leaders of such 
anri-Semitic free-for-all states 
such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and 
Syria, but is spewing age-old 
blame to the open cars of hi fel-
low bigots in the hopes of doing 
something to break the illusion-
ary Jewish control over their 
day-to-day affairs. Fortunately, 
when thi "something" rolls 
around, I can 't imagine it being

Money is available for 
library assistant raises 
Editor: 

I'm writing on behalf of the 
library assistants here on campus 
and throughout the UC system. 
Our library assistants work in 
acquiring and maintaining our 
excellent collections. We assist 
patrons and provide easy access in 
searchjng for and locating ma teri-
al. We also both archive and pre-
serve library material for future 
use. I'm sure our university librar-
ian would agree that without our 
library assistants, the UCSD 
Library would not be the interna-
tionally recognized research insti-
tution that it is today! 

While library assistants have 
increasingly shouldered more 
rcspon ibility, we have virtually 
been ignored as far as salary 
increases go. After years of rejec-
tion, we were given a bit of hope. 
Sharon Hayden (University of 
California Office of the President 
bargainer) gave indications last 
August that the university would 
be investigating the po ibility of 
equitable pay with the adminis-
trative a sistant eries for UC 
library assistants. Currently, we 
are paid at a much lower rate. 
Our bargaining team presented 
proof of the high skill levels nec-
essary to perform the tasks

required of our jobs during the 
August bargaining. 

Suddenly on Oct. 22, during 
bargaining, Hayden stated she 
was "not authorized" to make an 
offer or any changes on this issue. 
We were stunned! 

She is the UCOP chief bargain-
er, is she not? Why were we given 
fa lse hope and brought to bargain-
ing to make presentations only to 
be rejected again on this issue? 
How can she sit at the bargaining 
table as UC's official representative 
and not be authorized? 

Hayden claims it's not "bad 
faith bargain.ing" since they never 
officially made an offer to the 
library assist2nts. What about the 
integrity of indicating months 
before that they were willing to 
talk about this issue? What about 
aslcing the Coalition of University 
Employees to make official pre-
sentations documenting the skill 
levels needed? 

Did she raise the hopes of 
thousands of UC employees? You 
bet she did! 

This is definitely not a question 
of money. It's not a valid budget 
crisis. Not at all! It's a distribution 
crisis. This is evidenced by the 
huge salary increases and incentive 
awards that the university has 
recently given top level executives 
such as $80,000 to Sr. Vice 
President Joseph Mulinix, increas-
ing his salary to $350,000 with an 
annual $20,000 incentive award. 
Or the $171,000 incentive award 
given to Davis Russ, UC treasurer, 
after huge losses to our retirement 
account under his administration. 

Additionally, you'd have to.be 
blind to work on this campus and 
not notice the whole new college 
(Eleanor Roosevelt College) built 
during this current purported 
budget crunch! We ImUlIl they 
have the money! We are only ask-
ing for equity. Simply pay us what 
we're worth! 

We will be tabling in front of 
the library at UCSD in the next 
week and ask your assistance by 
signing our petition for 
equity. Additionally you can 
e-mail President Robert C. Dynes at 
Robm.Dyntl@ua;p.eduandOJancdJor 
Marsha A. Chandler at 
mcbandlrr@unJ.tdu to let them 
know you support pay equity for 
library assi tants. 

Thank you so very much in 
advance for all your support.

EdWu 

D espite its best attempts at hounding down http://www. ucsduncrnsurtd.cum, the uni-
versity has yet to provide an alterna-
tive that would let UCSD students 
interact online. For example, an 
online community might start evalu-
ating courses in a more meaningful 
way than the current CAP.E. sys-
tem of "students found this teacher's 
laundry hamper drier than Julia 
Dreyfus on a Saturday night" (8). It 
might let stu.dents get to know each 
other's pasts and thoughts without

"community" is nothing more than 
an amalgamated online journal, 
where just about anyone can post an 
update, to which everyone else can 
respond. Since message threads are 
shoved back regardless of their 
importance, the site is dynamic, and 
it encourages members to constantly 
watch and participate, lest they get 
left behind. 

The calamities of last week (and 
the utter lack of useful correspon-
dence from the administration in a 
place where sntdents would normal -
ly look) highlighted the benefits of 
paying attention to the UCSD 
Livejournal community. Nearly 
immediately after the notice went up 
on StudentLink (a place you just 
don't visit unless it's registration or 
grades time), the infonnation had 
propagated throughout the commu-
nity. Even more interesting was the 
response from the students, whjch 

having to sit down 
for coffee. It might 
allow for free and 
open discourse on 
entirely random yet 
pertinent issues -
like the city burning 
down. It could let 
prospective sru-
dents get a feel for 
the UCSD commu-
nity and solicit 
opinions from stu-
dents. 

the Iivejoumal 
system has spawned 
a 'community' of 

around 400 UCSD, 
affiliated members . " 

ranged from child-
like glee to conster-
nation. A li vely 
debate raged about 
whether or not one 
should be happy 
about the enti re 
mes . Ths is not to 
imply that the level 
of discussion was on 
par with, say, what 
you might find in a 
certain student 

Amazingly enough, such a thing 
exists, if only in embryonic form, at 
http://www.livtjUU17lllI.cuml-lIcsd. Yes, 
that Livejournal - the blogging ite 
that half the freshmen that have 
stepped into the donns this year use 
to post melodnmatic song lyrics, 
endless online quiz results and veiled 
threats against cheri hed friends. To 
be more specific, Livejournal is a 
Web site that allows people to post 
random updates throughout the day 
about the meaningless inanities of 
life ("8:03 a.m.: I've just brushed my 
teeth. Excited about the day.,,) using 
a Web-based interface. It makes 
showing the rest of the world the 
utterly trivial aspects of one's life 
much too easy. 

Despite (or maybe because of) its 
somewhat seedy/stellar reputation 
among our age group, the 
Livcjournal system has spawned a 
"community" of around 400 
UCSD-affiliated member . The 

newspaper: "All of those who are 
celebrating about there being no 
school tomorrow are narrow-mind-
ed slUt-heads." Or maybe it is on pa r. 

ince the announcements and 
subsequent discu sion of fire-related 
news, the journal communi ty has 
chatted about upper-division cia es, 
helped a student choose a professor 
for MMW5, and given admissions 
advice to a Colorado high school 
tudent. All silly and inane, but at a 

school where more than hal r f the 
students commute and on-campus 
life has been fla t-l ining for the pa t 
twO decades, any amow1t of inane 
interaction should be welcomed by

Horse: 
Campus will 
miss Ledden's 

influence 
continued from page 5 

the provosts at length (with the 
exception of Revelle College's, and 
no doubt Dr. Tom Bond is leg-
endary), I cannot emphasize that 
UCSD has lost a great man in the 
passing of Dr. Patrick Ledden, 
provost of Muir College, last week. 
The school has lost its best provost. 
While there is undoubtedly already 
an endless queue of people that 
have lined up to say beautiful 
things about this genial and intelli-
gent man that knew him much bet-
ter than I did, this writer feels 
obligated to describe how, having 
only talked to him at length twice 
in my time here, he has been one of 
the most guiding influences in my 
college experience. 

During orientation, he showed 
up to help Muir freshmen register 
for classes. It was Dr. Ledden's 
doing that landed me in the 
physics 4 sequence, which, in 
turn, has rurned me into a physics 
major and hopefully a physics 
graduate student next year. It was 
his words of conviction in the 
vibrancy and intelljgence of the 
UCSD srudent population that 
tipped the balance in deciding 
against transferring out of this 
school. I will remember Dr. 
Ledden as the person that 
reminded me how beautiful I 
found numbers and pushed me to 
tudy what I found beautiful. I am 

forever in his Ilcbt for that. 
That is his impact on one inso-

lent undergraduate with whom he 
had only tangential contact. I cannot 
begin to imagine the impact he made 
on UCSD tudentS over 30 years.

Porn: Gov't's definition of 
'obscenity' is too vague 

comillued from /Xlge 4 
Tbt New York S71n reported on 

Sept. 15 that the Justice Dcparonent 
is "going back" to enforcing obsceni-
ty laws by cracking down on pornog-
raphy producers and distributors. 
U.S. Attorneys are being trained in 
how to prosecute such cases, and the 
FBI, U.S. Customs and the U.S. 
Postal Service are mobilizing as the 
main enforcers. Although, the Sun 
reports, "bestiali ty, sexual violence, 
and unusual uses of human waste" are 
the focus right now, "there is no par-
ticular behavior that is off the table," 
according to J ohn Malcolm, deputy 
assistant attorney general for the 
criminal division. Producers of more 
mainstream pornography are also 
being prosecuted. 

A crackdown on pornography 
relies upon obscenity law, the basis of 
which is found in Milltr v. California. 
This 1973 case established the stan-
da rd "criteria" by which ill egal 
obsceni ty may be discerned from legal 
speech: Material is obscene if the 
"average" person finds that it "appeals 
to the prurient interest," if it depicts 
or describes sexual conduct in a 
"patently offensive way," and if it 
lacks "serious literary, artistic, politi-
calor scientific value." 

The problems with these criteria 
should be immediately apparent. Who 
is the "average" person, and how 
might a court determine that? Who 
decides what is "prurient," which the 
Merriam-Webster dictionary defines 
as "marked by or arousing an immod-
erate or unwholesome interest or 
desire; especially marked by, arousing, 
or appealing to unusual sexual desire"? 
How can we consistently determine 
what is "patent"? Who detennines lit-
erary or artistic value? Proponents of 
these criteria would have us believe the 
answers are simple: The courts make 
these decisions, and we can trust them 
to do so in a way that will satisfy all of 
us - that is, that will satisfy all of us 
who aren't degraded, unwholesome 
and otherwise a blight on society. 

Demonizing those who don't con-
form to vague moral standards is a 

poor, if storied, basis for law. Ob cenity 
law is prejudicial, ill -defined and nearly 
impossible to enforce. It relics on the 
idea that pornography i harmful to 
society and the individual, which has 
yet to be proven. What pornography 
does undermine is conservative religious 
views about sex, views which are not in 
the American mainstream - which 
should not be forced upon others. Not 
to mention that federa l attention to a 
legal issue that is explicitly local -
obsceni ty law looks to community 
standards, not national ones - smacks 
of inconsistency from a president 
whose party claims to protect states' 
rights. He extols the virtue of the free 
market when courting business dona-
tions and votes, but would now rather 
legislate the extermination of one of 
the most successful consumer-driven 
industries in the world. 

Better to hearken to the MiU" v. 
California dissent of] ustice William O. 
Douglas: "The First Amendment was 
not fashioned as a vehicle for dispens-
ing tranqui lizers to the people, Its 
prime function was to keep debate 
open to 'offen ive' as well as to 'staid' 
people .. . 'The use of the standard 
'offensive' gives authority to govern-
ment that cuts the very vitals out of the 
First Amendment." Whether one 
grants the government the barest of 
authority to ensure its people' well-
being (as conservatives do), or looks to 
government institutions to provide 
more hands-on care (as liberals do), 
the thought of giving the government 
the authority to decide what we can 
and cannot see, watch or read should 
be frightening. 

Bush and Attorney General John 
Ashcroft are looking to enforce their 
own morality upon the American peo-
ple, who spend increasing billions of 
dollars on porn every year, and the 
First Amendment i what suffers most. 

"I call upon public officials, law 
enforcement officers, parents and all 
the people of the United States to 
observe this week with appropriate 
programs and activities," the procla-
mation concludes. Book burning, 
anyone?

THUR DAY, NOVEMBER 6,2(0) THE UC D GUARDIAN 

Freshmen fill empty A.S. seats 
A.S. approves appointments for freshman senators 

By NEIL SPEARS 
Senior Staff Writer 

The A.S. Council approved the 
appointments of new freshman 
senators from each of UCSD's six 
colleges during the council's Nov. 5 
meeting. 

The new senators replace inter-
im representatives that have been 
serving as freshman senators since 
the council's first meeti ng in May. 

After reviewing applications and 
interviewing candidates, fre hman 
senators are selected by each col-
lege council and then must be 
approved by the A. . Council. 

"I was a little worried about my 
interview," newly appointed 
Eleanor Roosevelt ollege 
Freshman Senator Arielle Maccio 
said. "So when they called and said 
that I got it, I was so excited." 

1accio, who has a sel f-
described "passion for leadershi p," 
i the first freshman senator from 
ERC to live at the college's new 
campus. 

"OUT [college council] chairper-
son said, ' You need to Start checking 
your e-mail because you 're no 
longer an ordinary student, ' " 
Maccio said. "It's a lot of meetings, a 
lot of e-mailing back and forth and 
just a very large time commitment." 

Thurgood Marshall College 
Freshman Senator Alan Haimowitz 
was surprised to be appointed "not 
because I didn't feel like I could do 
it, but because it was a great 
honor." 

Ilaimowitz de cribed the job 
interview as "a little intimidating." 

"I had to go in for a joint-selec-
rion interview where they had ... a 
lot of pcople just sitting around in 
this little semi-circle with me in the 
ceOler," Il aimowitz said . 

"Everybody'S looking at you and 
you know that they're just judging 
you on everything that you say." 

Earl Warren College Freshman 
Senator Erik Ward said he also had 
a memorable interview. 

"I initially applied as a Uudicial] 
Board member," Ward said. "So 1 
go to my interview, and halfway 
through the interview, they tell me 
about senator and how it sounds 
like I'm more qualified for a sena-
tor job than J -Board." 

The fact that this is Ward's first 
position in student government has 
not deterred him from proposing 
campus changes ranging from get-
ting elevators inspected for safety 
to reducing the soggine of the 
gra s at Warren. Ward also hopes 
to decrease the number of stops on 
the campus loop shuttle route. 

"Between ovr and the parking 
lot for RIMAC, there are four 
stops," Ward said. "The bus does-
n't even get up to 10 miles-per-
hour. It's ridiculous." 

John Muir College Freshman 
Senator Billy Liebcrknecht, whose 
brother Nick was Muir College 
Council chair for 2002-03 , brings a 
familiar name to the council. He 
aid he looks forward to working 

with other counci lmembers to 
instirute a senator exchange pro-
gram between the colleges to pro-
mOte the spread of ideas. 

Joseph Chern, Sixth College'S 
freshman senator, was selected by 
the Student Council of Sixth 
College only one day before the 
A.S. Council meeting. 

hern, who said he looks for-
ward to impro\'ing the lives of ixth 
College freshmen, is al 0 a firm 
supporter of freshman parking. 

"Freshman have the ame prior-
ity as juniors and senior and the 

other classes," hern said. 
"[Freshman] are basically living on 
their own also, so why should they 
have any disadvantages'" 

Revelle College Freshman 
Senator Janet Wang plans to be 
careful in fulfilling the needs of her 
position without overcommitting 
her time. 

"J like to be involved, wherever 
I'm going," Wang said. "A.S. 
Council is able to offer me [the 
opportunity to) be informed about 
everything that's happening on 
campus, have a say in things, be 
able to represent, meet people, and 
get all of those benefi ts in one 
organization. " 

The length and formality of 
A.S. Council meetings are provid-
ing new experiences for the fresh-
man representatives. 

"[The council meetings] are 
very long, but I knew that going in, 
and very formal, which can intimi-
date a lot of people ... but it's all for 
a reason," Billy Lieberknecht aid. 

Ward de cribed the learning 
curve faced by freshman senators 
who arc unfamiliar with parliamen-
t31y procedure used at the meetings. 

"I didn'know what was going on 
the first couple meetings because, 
obviously, they're talking all this 
different parliamentary proce-
dure," Ward said. "Then, I went to 
the council retreat, and the next 
week at A.S. [Council], I knew what 
1 was doing. It was a lot easier to 
know what wa going on." 

Sixth College Chair Crystal 
Erlendson aid that the campus 
closures last week due to the fires 
in an Diego county caused a delay 
in the appointment proce . 

The council approved all of the 
senators' appointments by consen-
sus.

Campaigns: Students gather 
information for election 
continued from page I 

"We've been getting a group of 
people together who feel strongly 
about campaigning [for Dean] at 
UCSD," said Jeremy Cogan, prin-
cipal member of UCSD for Dean 
and secretary of College 
Democrats at UCSD. "Right now 
it varies, bur we've had maybe 15 
or so people expressing strong 
interest in taking part in the 
process, and I think that number is 
likely to grow as we do more activ-
ities." 

Cogan said the organization 
plans to organize meet-ups and 
trips to speeches by the candidates. 

UCSD for Dean modeled 
itself after student-run organiza-
tions supporting Dean at other 
universities such as UC Berkeley. 
Student-run Dean organizations 
also exist at UCLA and 
University of Southern 
California. 

Various UCSD supporters for 
Kerry have also met through 
http://unuw.71IUtllp.cum, with sup-
porters organizing a rally for Kerry 
tentatively scheduled for Nov. 18. 
The rally will include a live call-in 
from Kerry and a short documen-
tary about Kerry and his campaign. 

"There are local San Diego 
Kerry meet-ups, and I started 
attending those and ... got in con-
tact wi th other Kerry supporters 
in San Diego," said UCSD stu-
dent Mara Lee, who i organizing 
the rally. "We're trying to get this 
rally together as JUSt an informal 
invitation for San Diego support-
ers. We're targeting self-identified 
Democrats who haven 't decided 
which candidate to support. . .. 
just trying to get the word out." 

In the meantime, while 
President Bush is currently unop-
posed for the Republican nomina-

tion, Republicans on campus have 
also been active in promoting their 
views. College Republicans at 
UCSD organized a rally featuring 
several Republican senatorial can-
didates that had to be cancelled 
due to the fires. onetheless, they 
are preparing for the 2004 elec-
tions. 

"We work closely with the San 
Diego Republican Party and we do 
a lot of stuff for them," said John 
Altick, event coordinator for 
College Republicans at UCSD. 
"Once election season comes we'll 
be working closely for them." 

The College Republicans also 
campaign by tabling for voter 
registration on Library Walk. 

College Democrats at UCSD, 
an umbrella group for Democrats 
at UCSD with ties to both the 
Dean and Kerry supporters, is 
also monitoring the primary situ-
ation closely. Having contacted 
Dean, Kerry and Democrati c 
candidate Rev. Al Sharpton, the 
group plans to hold rallies in the 
spring, when primary season 
shifts into high gear. 

"We've been researching candi-
dates and deciding which candidate 
we want to support," said Kate 
Maull , president of College 
Democrats at UCSD. 

However, some students say 
they remain relati\'ely in the dark 
about the upcoming primaries. 

"I am not cu rrently as 
informed as I would like to be," 
Greg Mallis, a Sixth College 
sophomore said. "This \vill be the 
first election that I will be voting 
in, so r am very Interes ted in it, 
and I plan on getting as much 
information a r can on it. 
However, the recent political 
events of California have soured 
me to the whole process."

Wage: Over 50 supporters 
mak plea to city council 

Revelle: Member .. at .. large system abolished 
contlnlled from page I 

of the li \~ng wage debate. 
" an Diego has the second-

highe t COSt of Ii \~ng in the state of 
Clliforrua , and yet we remam the 
only major city in thi tate that 
does not have a living wage ordi-
nance," Bali said. 

Concerned citiz n Andy Berg 
followed Bali by assernng "it i 
time that we top being compl icit in 
providing job that don't allow even 
for the basics." 

Berg also described the reality 
that manv low-income workers are 
forced to make long- tenn careers 
out of menial janitorial o r landscap-
ing jobs. 

"\ Vc 'rc not asking that they buy 
a house in Ran ho Santa Fe, or even 
a house in Rancho Pena qui tos or 
Rancho an Diego - but they 
should be able to get the basics to 
survive," Berg said. 

"'Living wage' is a convenient 
term that sti rs emotion and sensa-
tional headlines, but let's peel away 
the emotion and look at the tacts," 
she said . "The fact is that what is 
upported today is a request for the 

city of San Diego to mandate high-
er wages on a elect number of bus i-
ne ses. Is this fair? Does it make 
good business sense? We do not 
believe so." 

Representatives from social 
service organization such a the 
YMCA a nd Harmonium also 
expressed concern for the possi -

b�e detrimental effects of living 
wage. 

"The YMCA is not taking a 
po i tion ei ther for or against the liv-
ing wage ordinance at this time," 
after- chool specialist Lynn 
Le czcynski said. "At the same 
time, there is no question that the 
ordinance would in fact create eco-
nomic hardship and significant neg-
ative impact on all social service 
programs that are being contracted 
by the city with nonprofit 
providers." 

contin ued from page I 
cil, who would then hold internal 
elections to fill specific positions 
like chair and financial controller, 
future elections will allow stu-
dents to vote contenders direct:ly 
into specific offices. 

"I'm excited that [the amend-
ments and election reform] 
passed," said Revelle senior 
Melissa Tsang, the chair of 
Revelle College Council. "With 
the new slate system being intro-
duced at the college-based elec-
tions, I think students will really 
have a say of who is elected for 
each position ." 

Before the vote, Revelle 
remained the only college that did 
not allow voters to decide what 
position the majority of candi-
dates filled . 

Last year, internal elections 
resulted in a tie for the top posi-
tion of chair, with the outgoing 
chair making the deciding vote. 

"There was sort of this feeling 
that we did the best we could with 
the situation, but we wanted to 
make sure it wouldn't happen 
again," said Revelle sophomore 
Sara Jamshidi, who serves as the 
commuter representative on the 
council and had the task of man-

aging the special election . 
Revelle students also approved 

several constitutional amend-
ments by a 293 -50 vote. 

Recommended by a subcom-
mittee formed to explore updates 
to the constitutions, the changes 
dealt with a variety of procedural 
is ues, including changing the 
order of agenda items at council 
meetings, adding the previous 
year's chair to the council as a 
nonvoting member, and removing 
restrictions for meeting times of 
the Revelle Organizations 
Committee. 

"All of the changes are to real-
ly give [students] more of the 
voice," Jamshidi said. "The 
changes to the agenda are to help 
the students who come to our 
meetings." 

Students could only vote on 
the amendments collectively, 
passing all or none. 

"If they had been separated, I 
would have voted for most of 
them," said Revelle junior 
Emmanuel Betancourt, who voted 
against all the proposed adjust-
ments because he opposed one of 
them. 

Originally scheduled to end 
on Oct. 3 I , RCC officials 

extended the voti ng period 
through Nov. 4, because the 
Web hyperlink needed to vote 
appeared one day late and wild-
fires temporarily shut down the 
entire campus. 

Though the system logged 
more than 50 completed ballots 
within the first hour, less then 12 
percent of Revell e's 3,697 stu-
dents voted in the special elec-
tion. 

The low turnout carne despite 
an incentive drive, which 
prOinised candy tQ all those who 
participated. . 

By early Oct. 3, the day 
before the end of the election 
period, less than 30 voters 
claimed their sweets, Jamshidi 
said. 

Revelle students admitted 
that they had trouble under-
standing the technical amend -
ments. 

"I know there is an election, 
but I don't know what it's about," 
Revelle freshman Gabriela Avila 
said. "]'m new here so I don't have 
very much information to make 
decisions. " 

Both parts of the ballot items 
needed only a simple majority to 
pass. 

Living wage supporter sta te 
that many service e mployees in 
San Diego live at or below the 
poverty line. This, in turn, nega-
tively affects the quality of service 
to the CIty and the public, their 
camllaign claims. In addition to 
ra ising the standard of living for 
impoverished familics, the cam-
paign hopes that by increasing the 
pay of low-income workers, busi-
nes e and taxpayers will al so ben-
efit from increased producthity 
and reduced dependence on gov-
ernment-funded social program . 
Some, however, were not con-
VInced bv the "wi n-win" situation 
described by living wage support-
ers. 

Many who did not directly 
oppose the campaign demanded 
more information about the poten-
tial repercussions the ordinance 
would have on San Diego. Lisa 
Briggs, executive director of the 
San Diego County Taxpayer 
As ociation, clarified the associa-
tions position. 

Ethnicity: Admissions 'on track,' says UC 

Patricia Walsh, executive direc-
tor of the San Diego chapter of the 
California Restaurant sociation, 
strongly opposed the ordinance 
before the commi ttee. 

"11Ie taxpayer's association is nor 
curr~nt1y opposed to the ordinance," 
she sardo "But we absolutely believe 
that further study is necessary." 

The Rules Committee unani-
mously voted to further the study in 
a 90-day certain time frame . 
Re ults will be presented to the 
City Council in February 2004 for 
review.

Cou~ Warner Bros. 
Computers gone wild: Keanu Reeves returns to finish the 
"Matrix' series in this visually stunning film. 

The Oracle in "The Matrix: Revolutions" says, "Everything that has a beginning must have an end." This truth will ring all tOO true for fans of the "Matrix" 
series that have eagerly awaited explanation of the series' 
numerous ambiguities. This visually stunning final chapter 
in the Matrix Story does an excellent job of wrapping up all 
of the loose ends created by the first two films and goes 
beyond this simple requirement to make a number of its 
own statements. For those who have seen the first twO 
films, expect more of the same and then some from 
"Revolutions." 

Forget the 14-page explana tion your geek friend wrote 
on the meaning of the ending of "The Matrix Reloaded." 
All the theories regarding the implications of the end of 
"Reloaded" are put to rest with the finale of the ttilogy and 
easily explained by " Revolutions." The whole story cleans 
up better than a frat boy headed downtown. 

Despite the replacement of the Oracle from the first twO 
films with a look-alike (the actress who originally played 
the Oracle passed away between the filming of "Reloaded" 
and "Revolutions"), the finale of "Revolutions" is surpris-
ingly less confusing than that of " Reloaded." "Revolutions" 
does an excellent job of interjecting new characters, ideas 
and story lines amidst the backdrop of lore the Wachowski 
brothers create, making a film worthy of praise outside its 
relationship to the acclaimed predecessors. 

The end of " Revolutions" leaves those that have seen the 
trilogy with a cohesive and provocative look at the state of 
human life in the modern world. It includes love, religion, 
fate, choice, war and eventually peace. The "Matrix" series 
has a little bit of something for everyone and is accom-

plished by taking a fresh look at the philosophical problems 
that have plagued mankind since inception. In a span of 
seven hours, the "Matrix" trilogy allegorically explains the 
human condition and does so more effectively than ever in 
"Revolutions." This fantastic finish to the series places it in 
film history as one of the best trilogies of all time. 

Keanu Reeves fans, if such people in fact exist, may be 
disappointed with the lack of screen time received by eo 
in this film . "Revolutions" deals more with the complex si t-
uation facing the city of Zion, where the first two focused 
on eo. A number of minor characters from "Reloaded" 
receive considerable screen time as part of the battle for 
Zion which, despite being visually fascinating, runs long. 
The film redeems itself by providing one of the most stun-
ning fight scenes ever between Neo and Smith . 

It is difficult to imagine anyone who enjoyed the first 
two films in the series not relishing the third. " Revolutions" 
may gain even more fans because the audience leaves the 
theater awestruck rather than bewildered . It would be a pity 
if anyone that saw the first twO films were to miss 
"Revolutions."

The amorous artist : Interview with 'Anything But Love' creator 
Independent screenwriter, director and actress sits down to discuss her battle to create an indie musical 

By BRIAN UIGA 
Contributing Writer 

sabel Rose i what you might ca ll an over-achiever. An 
actress for most of her life, she quit the business at 25 to 
mastermind the process of screenwriting. Ten years later, 

she 's back wim a vengeance and a fi lm ready to blow the socks 
off of anyone that thinks that the movie musical is dead. 

GUllrdian: So you're a lot like your persevering character 
Billie Golden m the film . You two hare anything other than 
the work ethic? 

Isabel Rose: Everyone always wants to know if it's auto-
biographical, and if I'm Billie olden, but I'm not Billie 
Golden. I'm actu Ily not from orona, ueens; I'm not a 
cabaret inger. But the similarities between Billie and I are 
optimism and ,I drea my nature. I really do hear music and ee 
the w rid differently. I think everyon does, like you know 
whcn p ople are walking down the street with their 
\ Valktnan on? 

G: They CrealC their own soundtrack for the w rid. 
IR: Right. [ totally fall into that categ ry, and I wanted 

to create a character who lived that way. But you havc to 
under tand, [wa rai ed on tho e movies. Every Friday 
night of my life from six ye rs old to 16, I aw an M M 
movie musical in my living room . My dad would get the e 
print, we would change reel , and during the reel changes 
we would act ur favorite ong . When you look ba k on it, 

it was so holtey and wholesome, but I'm incredibly grateful 
for it. 

G: So "Anything but Love" is an homage to those old 
films? 

IR: It's an homage in certain respects, I can tell you 
that. omeone said to me: "This film is never going to 
make it, it's 0 cliche." 1 said we worked very hard to cre-
ate that. I mean, there are two moments that are a cliche 
and so hokey that people sometime burst IntO sponta-
neous applause when they see them, and don 't even know 
why. One moment is when my character corne out of the 
Times Square subway tation dressed as Holly Golightly in 
Breakfast at Tiffany', and the other moment is when, 
dre ed as Holly Golightly, she and reg Ellenbogen kis 
outside the fountain at the Plaza, and the camera pans up 
into the fountain and away. P ople giggle. And why do yo u 
giggle? Bccause it's just so corny! It's ridiculou , it' just 
like tho e old movies. 

G: 0, how did thi a tually get made and picked up? An 
independent musical sound like an e~tremely hard sell. 

lR: Such a hard sell. Literally everybody, including 
someone 1 spoke to ycslcrday on the ph ne, thinks I'm 
crny. The enure world is a "Warning, turn back" ign. 1 
feel like I'm thi lking, running through the street with a 
pear, and on the end of my spear i my video. It' good to 

have a purpo e in life, especially with thi film, when the 
purpo e is joyful. There's so much darkne in theater 

Triple threat: Isabel Rose is the mu~i·talented force behind the 
imprcssl\le indie musical "Anything But Love.' 
right now. 

G: Everybocly' got tht' ang t-ridden bit, or the tfllogy 
where nothing will ever work right until the third film . 

IR: (Laughs) Well , certainly in the indie \ o rld. I was 
rejected from 17 film ~ tivals. I look at all the indie films out 
there and there' many I don 't even know whi h on' to g 
to. But the lea t I can ay about my film is that y u will defi -
nitely be uplifted. There' ju t no way around that. And that's 
not a bad rea on to go see a film.

REVIEW 

By JESSICA LONG 
Senior Staff Writer 

With the tag line "Sassy, Strong, Relevant," it is no wonder that Urban Bush 
Women have been a force in the 
world of contemporary dance. 
This powerful group of women 
combines dance with theatre, 
song, torytelling and activism to 
give it a unique style. 

Founded 20 years ago by 
Jawole Will J o Zollar, the compa-
ny uses the art of dance to spread 
its mes age of necessary socia l and 
poli tical change. 

I\'iaria Bauman, a dancer in the 
company for the last two yea rs, 
sa id that the greatest strength is 
"the commitment of the dancers 
to the integrity of the work." She 
believes that the dancers are dedi-
cated to the company' valucs, 
which help them to tay"unified 
and strong." 

Zoll ar has created more than 
th irry dances for Urban Bush 
'Nomen, focusing on a variety of 
topics and playing to the strengths 
of her dancers. he has also creat-
ed da-nces for other companies, 
inc/utling Alvin Ailey American 
Dance Theatre. Zollar still man-
ages to divide her time between

YOU know those people at the mall who look lost and confu cd? Thats the feeling upon walking 
out of "The Singing Detective." 

The movie is about Dan Dark, a 
detective novelist with a scarred 
childhood and a flimsy grasp on 
reality. Robert Downey Jr. plays 
Dark in one of his better perfor-
mances. I-launted by his past and 
trying to outrun the misery of his 
own existence, Dark is a ball of 
depressed, arcastic fury.

derous gangster thugs. 

Courtesy 01 UniYersily Events OffICe 
Meaningful expressions: The diverse dance troupe Urban Bush Women 
express the female experience through dance and will visit UCSD on Nov. 7. 

In his attempts to renounce real-
ity, Dark paints himself into the plot 
of his own detective novel. He 
becomes a 19505 gumshoc moon-
lighting as a singer who inspires the 
mwical renditions of doo-wop hits 
in the film's mwical numbers. The 
sleuth find himself playing a dan-
gerow game in a story that mixes in 

The movie's twO basic settings 
are a hospital and the shadowed '50s 
Los Angeles nightclub scene. 
Suffering from a crippling disease in 
his skin and joints, Dark is trapped in 
a hospital bed. The small, bright, 
sterilized room leavc~ nowherc for 
Dark to hide his scaly face. To add 
insult to injury, Dark is expo ed to 
the inspection of a panel of aloof, 
musically inclined doctors. The 
sympathetic ursc Mills (Katie 
Holmes) doesn't necessarily help 
when faced with an embarrassing 
"accident." The only character able 

modern dance companies is its 
focus on the multi-faceted lives 
of women both in the past and 
present. This emphasis is reflect-
ed the array of women in that 
comprise the company. There is 
a wide range of ages represented 
as well as range of body types and 
strengths. 

In addition to focusing on the 
issues of women, Urban Bush 
Women have a trong interest in 
the African American communi ty. 
Zollar has taken her ew York-
based company throughout the 
United States as well as through 
Latin America and Europe to help 
pread its message. 

On ov. 7, Urban Bush 
Women will come to UCSD. 
They will perform "Hair 
Stories. n This powerful produc-
tion u es the backdrop of hair 
and hair styles to delve into such 
topics as gender, abu e, aging, 

race, class and self-esteem, to 
name a few. 

Bauman feels that this produc-
tion should be particularly perti-
nent to university students. She 
believes that, "At this point in 
their lives, students are at the 
height of their activist period, and 
this piece helps people to look at 
things in different ways." 

This is bound to be a power-
ful and unique performance with 
something of importance for 
everyone, regardles of back-
ground or gender.

performing at Mandeville

'Elephant' misses it's potential 
Improvisation, untrained actors ruin films dramatic edge 

Film 
REVIEW 

By DAVID BYNUM 
Senior Staff Writer 

The pitch for "Elephant" sounds swell : one of the premier directors of this gen-t:ration takes on one of the nation's 
biggest problems in a film th.at mimics the 
events of Columbine. All the anecdotes 
about the film's production added to the 
intrigue. The film was shot in a shutdown 
high school in Washington and was 95 per-
cent unscripted, and not one of the teenage 
characters in the film was played by a profes-
sional actor. On top of that, it was not shot in 
a letterbox format but in 4:3 aspect ratio. 

Director Gus Van Sant fidgeted with every 
traditional aspect of film in making 
"Elephant" (named after a BBC documentary 
which felt violence was a huge beast that could 
no longer be ignored), and in doing so, he 
ultimately hurt the film's overall effect. The 
non-traditional elements of the film detract 
from what is otherwise a very fair-handed sur-
vey of the issue of school violence. 

The eerie detachment that the camera 
has from those on the screen helps to keep 
the issue that the film deals with at arm's 
length . The fi;m's greater purpose, more 
than trying to provide answers, is to say 
that there are none. "Elephant" tries to 
capture the mundane elements of everyday 
high school life and juxtapose them with 
the extraordinary things that take place in 
schools like Columbine. Jr is a very inter-
esting visual experiment and a dangerous 
chance for a director to take (whi ch is per-
haps why he was awarded best director at 
Cannes), "Elephant" is as intriguing as the 
hype would suggest, wilhout being as good

as one might have hoped. 
A good majority of the film follows single 

charncters for nearly five minutes at a time 
while they basically do nothing. Walking 
through hallways, having meaningless conver-
sations, lcissing; the length of the shots along-
side their lack of action or real dialogue soike 
the viewer as being very different from any 
type of action seen on the big screen and rein-
force the i~<:a that this film is not trying to ay 
anything dramatically. UnfortLlllately, the use 
of non-professional actOrs and impromptu dia-
logue made some of the scenes feel too unnat-
ural . While not using a script was meant to 
make the film feel mOre real, it had the oppo-
site effect, and at times, "Elephant" comes 
across as some strange hybrid of reality TV 
and documentary.

Less is more for Halloween 
Girls plan sexy costumes, while guys are sticks of gum

David "Buzz" Bynum 

The collegiate world has a different hierar-chy of holidays than the rest of the world . I don't have it exactly figured out, but in 
my time here at UCSD, I have managed to 
discern that Halloween is pretty near the top. 
We live in a community with a number of dif-
ferent religions, so religious holidays are Out 
the window; Thanksgiving is spent with fami-
ly for the most part, and July 4th is during the 
summer. That leaves Halloween to battle it out 
with PresidentS' Day. To the average college 
Student, it 's no contest. 

While many will argue that Mardi Gras 
has a one-up on Halloween because of gratu-
itOus nashing that rakes place in exchange for 
plastic beads, I would encourage those who 
fcel thi way to venture over lO San Diego 
State for a bit next Halloween. Many of the 
women's costumes over at State provide 
near-nashing, free of charge. 

An evening walk on the San Diego State 
strip is sure to provide an eyeful for members 
of both sexes - and leave too many Tritons 
wondering why they ever chose UCSD over 
SDSU. For an answer to this question, vi it 
the line at the student health clinic at State in 
early ovember. 

For those of you who didn't make it to 
State this IIalloween, allow me to sum up 
what you missed out on. The ladies wore one 
of the following costumes (be aware that th is 
Ii t is exhaustive): hot nur e, hot angel or hot 
devil. That's what they call "the big three," 
and they are all meant to show off wthe big 
lWO." Gu~ were n t wearing costumes, or 
were dres ed a cowboys, complete with 
jeans and a cowboy shirt. Ilere at U 0 , 
however, we hold ourselve lO a higher stan-
dard. 

Everyone face the ame problem on 
r lalloween, and we all rt of deal with it in 
the ame way. You want to be able lO get IntO 

the party to ee what there i to see, but you 
can't get in without 3 costume. 

Guys tend to do the bare minimum to gel 
by when it comes ro co tumes. none 
extreme end of thi s problem is my friend 
Ross, who won second place in last yea r 's 
campus co tume contest si mply by wearing a 
red thong. When it co me to Hall oween, less 
is always more. 

On the other, admittedly more boring, 
end of the spectrum are those like myself. 
Last year, after a midterm on Halloween 
night, I just threw on a jumpsuit and said I 
was a mechanic. 0 one seemed to mind. 
Freshman year, my roommates and l bought 
a large quantity of tin foil and wrapped our-
selves in it. There were three of u sporting 
the same costume, and we told people we 
were a stick of gum, a baked potaro, Or a love 
machine, depending - as you might imagine 
- on who asked. Clevemes can go a long 
way to replace poor preparation . 
Unfortunately, we ended up at a party that 
was packed wall-to-wall, and whenever we 
tried to dance with anyone, they complained 
that the foil was scratchy. By the end of the 
night, very little of the foil remained. Had I 
not returned home terribly, terribly alone, 
that might have been a good thing. 

With the ladies, the co tume is u ually 
planned out a couple weeks in advance, if 
not more. While some will sp rt cute and 
clever outfilS, the common den minator 
for most ladies eem to be that Halloween 
is JUSt a good excuse to dre s lip like a kank 
- and I say this with the sincerest appreci -
ation. The great thing aboul Ilalloween is 
that it is the one day of the year when 
dressi ng lilce a skanle doesn't make people 
think you are a ska nk, I have alway appre-
CIated the fact that the women of U SD 
talee that opportunity t take an in -deplh 
look at hoochle-ma ma culture . ut ide of 
the aforementioned "big three," the Triton 
ladies of ye teryear have dre sed a Brimey

On his fourth major solo release, Ryan Adams borrows the updated bl ues ri ffs of 197 Os 
'r.Rex, the layered guitars of 
'80s Smiths, the sonic 
grandeur of '90s Smashing 
Pumplcins, and the post-mil-

a niche in the rap genre. 

Trice comes with a dis-
tin ct and flowing rhythmic 
style , but he sadly has uno-
riginal beats that bear the 
obvious marks of Dr. Dre 
and Eminem. Trice's claim 
to fame, "Got Some

is a gloriously upbeat, guitar-
heavy album that breaks with 
his mellow alt-country past. 

Rock N Roll (in reverse) 
pays homage to Adams' '80s 
heroes, such as in the first 
si ngle "So Alive." His singing 
evokes U2's lead singer Bono 
but backs it up with gritty,

Chitter chatter: Isabel Rose plays the lounge singer Billie Golden in the indie 
musical that gives the audience nostalgia for the Technicolor musicals. 

By BRIAN UICiA sings in the darkness, Billie dreams 
Contributing Writer of being an airbrushed starlet in a 

classy club. Yes, you've heard the 
story before: It's one of those 'I want 
to be a star' musical romances, like 
the other 300 or so that were pro-
duced during the supposed Golden 
Age of film . 

They meet, they ki and they burst into song in the classic 'Technicolor' musicals, which 
donninated the screen during the 
19-+05 and '50s, which were fuji of 
moments like these, where cheesy 
romance lead I11to a vocal rendition 
of a popular standard. Thi make it 
aU the more surpri ing when the 
current film "Anything But Love," 
which wears Its Technicolor influ-
ences on its leeve, doe not ha"e a 
single awkward 'bursting into song 
for no apparent reason' moment. 
Perhaps It's bt:cau e It's an indie 
musical. 

Yes, "Anytlung But Love" is an 
independent musical. Ambitious 
writer/direcror/acuess Isabel Rose 
plays Billie Golden, a lounge singer 
who can t quite get her lucky break 
in show business and instead sings 
her heart out at an airport bar. she 

Bur all of this cyniCISm about 
Technicolor musicals goes right out 
the \\~ndow when we see the first 
kiss. It's nothing short of pure magic: 
It's the kind of magic that makes 
countless directors fear for their 
lives. This film effortlessly oozes the 
kind of chemi try that so many 
recent rotten romances ha"e been 
trying to achieve. Never mind the 
drcary "How ro Lose a Guy in 10 
Days," this movie gives "Sleepless in 

cattle" a run for its money in terms 
of pure romance, while keeping the 
joyful sensibility of a Disney flick. 

And that's just the first kiss. The 
film tops itself ~th more dazzling 
kisses and a deliciously tortured love

REVIEW 

uiangle, culminating in the infatua-
tion between l3illic and her bohemi -
an piano teacher, played with gusto 
by Andrew McCarthy. The audi-
ence becomes so entranced watch-
ing this romance unfold that we for-
get about the plot holes, the cliches 
and the other telling signs of 
Technicolor musicals. All that's left 
is a quasi-nostalgic magic, which 
nestles right into the twilight of the 
soul and reminds audiences of the 
warmth that old films have. 

Of course, this celebrated magic 
is sometimes broken by stale comic 
relief as an array of cameo perform-
ers (with nothing else to do) mill 
around spouting one-liners. T he 
musical dream sequences, apart 
from a single srunning dance num-
ber, scream of po t-production 
awkwardness. But in the end, it's 
nice to remember Billie' rcfrain, 
which makes up half of the sound-
track for the film , "I can't give you 
anything but lo\'e." 

This film succeeds wildly by 
gi,oing love - so much love that it's 
impossible to not he mo"cd by it. 
One only hope that such a film 
lasts in theaters long enough for all 
those lonely dreamers in February 
to get a taste.

Sophomore diver Jason 
Boehm came in second to Santa 
Cruz's Adam Guiterrez in both

T he meet revealed UCSD's 
strength and depth, especially 
\vithin the freshman class. 

"Both teams should do better 
this year," UCSD head coach 
Scott McGihon said. "Those are 
expectations shared by the whole 
tcam." 

On ov. 8, UCSD will com-
pete at UC Davis, and they hope 
to improve on la t year's perfor-
mance. 

"Last year UC Davis beat us at

Tyter Huff/Guardian

meet of the year, 195-95 CNef Ucsc. 
Christine Hyjek said. "We have a 
really positive attirude going into 
this. We want to how them what 
a strong team we are this year.» 

Real athletes keep playing even

being a professional RP player

scores forces the rest of the team to 
compete for the final two spots, and 
that will make the team better for 
years to comc," Scheer said. 

Dolby, the third of the Triton 's 
big three, is by no means a distam 
third, cven managing to come in 
second place in the first tourna-
ment of the season. 

"Joe is very long off the tee, and 
is becoming a better putter," 
Wydra said. "He is also very em -
tional , and can get into streaks 
when he 's on." 

Dolby'S 65 in hi final round of 
the first tournament of the season is 
a school record for lowest round 
evcr. 

"I'm really happy with how I'm 
hitting the ball," Do lby said . "My 
65 in the first tournament was a 
career best, it was really JUSt the 
best I've ever hit the ball, and every 
part of my game was the besl ever." 

Despite missing the team's most 
recent tournament, Dolby has still 
managed to act as a team leader and 
has provide dependable re ults for 
the team, as well as achieve a 
national ranking his first two tour-
naments. 

"This season has started with 
the most con istent gol f I've ever 
played ," Dolby said . " I'm looking 
forward to spring season. This is 
just a taste of things to come and 
with more practice and more tour-
naments, who knows what will hap-
pen." 

umbers alone aren't the on ly 
proof of Dolbys success though; his 
teammates have noticed it as well. 

"Joe worked very hard over the 
summer on his game, and the 
results are obvious," Scheer said. 

The Tritons will start their sea-
son again on Feb. 23 and Feb. 24 
when they compete in the Family 
Motor Invitational in Bakersfield,

Men's soccer: UCSD will 
play No.3 Taros in CCAAs 

conrintjed from page 24 
from teammate J hnny Richardson 
and bear l r iton goalkeeper Jeremy 
Cookson from 20 ya rds Ollt. UCSD 
made an aTtempt to tie thc game, 
recording eight shots and eight cor-
ner kicks in the second half. 

"It was tough to bear that one. 
We just couldn't buy a goal ," 
Armstrong sa id . 

Although the Tritons have lost 
their last two games after winning 
the previous four, Armstrong is sti ll 
pleased with his team 's play. 

"We were doing everything 
right. The difference between now 
and when we were winning and 

oring thrce goals a game is finish-

ing," Armstrong said. " But I'm 
happy with how we're playing, 
apart from scoring goals." 

UCSD will definitely necd to 
score a few goa ls this weekend if it 
hopes to extend its season. At Cal 
State DomingN·7. Hills, the Tritons 
will be up against a physical Toro 
team, which lost a red-card-
plagued game to UCSD, 3-2, on 
Sept. 28. If the Tritons get past the 
nation's No.3 team on Nov. 7, they 
will take on the winner of the other 
semifinal game between Cal State 
San Bernardino and No. 12 Chico 
State in the finals on Nov. 9.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN SPORTS 19 

Soccer: Seniors want to go out with a title 
continued from page 24 

in their 2- 1 loss. With this win, 
Cal Poly Pomona will play Cal 

tate Dominguez IIills on Nov. 7. 
Despite the make-up games 

and the ri gorous scheduling, 
McManus thinks it will be an 
"anything goes" playoffs. 

"Once you get there, anything 
ca n happen, as we've seen in the 
past. This year's team is great, like 
past years', but for different rea-
sons," McManus said . "We're 
well-balanced and our skill level is 
very good ." 

UCS D also boasts nine 
seniors, seven of which have 
already won NCAA titles. They 
remember the seniors of years 
past walking away with rings. 

"You can't go out any better," 
senior co-captain Kristin Jones 
said. "We saw it happen sopho-
more year and would love to do 
the same." 

Senior Christine Wensel 
agreed. 

"This championship would 
definitely be sweeter than the oth-
ers if we can leave on that note," 
Wensel said. "It couldn 't be more 
perfect." 

Indeed, the seniors playing in 
their final games will have a vital 
role, adding the experience and 
the confidence needed to go all 
the way. Yet the freshmen will 
prove no less important. 

"Ths could be the best fresh-
men class I've seen in the four years 
I've been here," said Jones, who 
herself was a member of the fresh-
men squad that helped lead UCSD 
to their fir t national title. "They 
have the potential to win three 
more [championships] in a row." 

\,vensel expressed a similar 
sentiment. 

"The freshmen are playing just 
as hard and want it just as much as 

the seniors," Wensel said . 
With a strong freshman class, 

experienced seniors, and other 
integral starters such as sopho-
mores Heather Szafraniec and 
Lindsey Treankler, UCSD is 
poised for anothcr title run. 

"It 's a total team effort," Jones 
said. "The statistics show we don 't 
have just one weapon." 

The overall balance is seen on 
offense and defense, but also in 
goal. UCSD boasts three seasoned 
goalies in junior Jamie 
Lautenschleger, sophomore A1yson 
Berger and senior K2mi Poma. 
Each member of the trio has 
logged serious minutes during the 
2003 campaign. With a laborious 
playoff schedule ahead, the depth 

of UCS D at every position could 
prove the difference. The onl y 
thing left is execution and nerves. 

"I'm a little nervous," fresh-
man Kelly Cochran said. "r don't 
know what to expect." 

With the defending Division II 
NCAA champions Christian 
Brothers lurking, plus perennial 
powerhouses I orthcrn Kenrucky 
and Franklin Pierce looking to 
make their way to the finals, 
Cochran feels a little apprehen-
sive. However, the Tritons are 
ready to clinch another title. 

M endoza summeJ up the 
players' feelings in one simple 
sentence. "This year, we are 
absolutely out for redemption ," 
she said .

Z2 PORTS THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Freshmen lead women's soccer 
Newcomers become vital part of offense 

By ANGELA UN 
Contributing Writer 

The UCSD women's soccer 
team had yet another stellar season, 
maintaining a 14-2-0 record, 
clinching their fourth-straight 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association South clivi ion title, and 
already receiving a berth to the 
CCAA playoffs. A large pan of the 
Tritons' uccess on the field is due 
to three remarkable freshmen : 
Kelly Cochran, Heather Sugg and 
Megan Dickey. These three 
women are among the team leaders 
in points and game-winning goal . 

All three freshmen contributed 
to the 4-2 win against Cal State 
Bakersfield on Oct. 12. Although 
the game was tied I-I entering the 
second half, Sugg was able to begin 
the second half of the game wi th a 
goal off an assist from Dickey. 
Cochran then followed with anoth-
er shot, making the score 3-1. The 
last goal of the game came off a 
shot from senior Megan Mendoza, 
assisted by Sugg. In addition, 
Cochran tallied a goal and an assist 
while Dickey added a goal in the 
overwhelming 14-0 defeat of 
Grand Canyon on oV. I. This has 
been the type of effort and resul ts 
that the freshmen have contributed 
to the team all season: great plays 
made on the field, goals scored and 
assiSts made left and right. 

Both Sugg and Cochran scored 
goals in a 2 -I victory over rival UC 
Davis. Sugg played a key role in the 
first goal of the game, firing a shot 
that was then deflected into the

eyn: Marlins 
overcome 

odds to win 
continued from ~ 24 

While I respect the rich history 
of the YanXees, I was glad to see the 
young Marlins overcome the odds 
and win, proVIng that even money 
and mystique cannot defeat the lit-
tle guy. The more storied ball clubs 
like the Yanks, Cubs, Red Sox and 
Braves largely overshadowed the 
Marlins. And no doubt, the Red 
Sox and the Cubs were America's 
darlings. However, the Fish k.ept 
on playing baseball, many times in 
front of empty seats. Now, they 
have much reason to celebrate. 

Seeing underdogs scrap their 
way to the top gives me hope. Our 
UCSD sports teams can be likened 
to the little guy. We don't have any 
athletes on scholarships, isolating 
us from the re t of the NCAA 
Division II schools. At times, it 
seems that no one really cares how 
good we are. Who knows, one or 
more of our teams may pull a Fish 
move and win it all this season.

ments. Readefs send her e-mails at

goal by a UC Davis player. 
Cochran scored the winning goal 
off a penalty kick, giving the 
Tritons the win. 

"It felt awesome to be a part of 
that win," Cochran said. "That was 
a big victory for us, and it just felt 
really good to have beaten Davis." 

Cochran, who plays left mid-
field and forward, is currently the 
team's leading goal scorer with 
eight goals, including three game-
winners. A soccer player since the 
age of five, Cochran played for 
SoCal United in West Lake 
Village, Calif. until last year. 

"College soccer is definitely 
different from club in that the 
level of play is more intense, and 
every game is important and 
counts just as much as a playoff 
one," Cochran said. As for the 
pressure of starting on the field, 
Cochran said, "There hasn't been 
a whole lot of pressure on us 
becau e no one expects too much 
because we're freshme n." 

McManus has been impressed 
during Cochran 's performace dur-
ing the season. 

"Kelly JUSt goes 100 mph during 
games," head coach Brian 
McManus said. "Not only is she 
great offensively, but she works on 
her defense toO; shes not always 
looking to go forward with the ball. 
She's a great player who just never 
stops running." 

On the other hand, the 5-foot-
9-inch Sugg is a more discreet 
player on the field . 

"Heather just plays simple; she 
does her job, doesn't get beat, dis-
tributes the ball well, and i n't a 
fla shy player," McManus said. 
"She also has the absolute beSt 
corner lcicks in her age division." 

Sugg has contributed four goals 
and an assist during the eason. The 
center mid6elder who played for 
the oCal Blues is from Lake 
Forest, Calif. Sugg and Dickey are 
tied for second in game-,,~nning 
goals with twO apiece. 

Another great addition to the 
team, Dickey plays center and 
right midfield and played a key 
role as a starter, but was forced to 
sit out for pan of the season due to 
a partially torn ACL. Dickey play 
a long-ball game, which puts her 
at second on the team in assists. 

"Megan is a very strong player 
with tremendous shots and cross-
es," McManus said. "She is a very 

strong defensive player and she 
loves to tackle. She's definitely liv-
ing up to our expectations for her." 

Dickey, who graduated from 
Torrey Pines High School, is from 
Del Mar, Calif. 

So how difficult was it to adjust 
to a new team? "It was a bit differ-
ent playing mid fielder and not 
knowing everyone at first," 
Cochran said. "But the upperclass-
men are awesome and made us feel 
welcomed from the beginning." 

Sugg expressed similar senti-
ments. 

"The seniors are definitely a big 
part of getting us ready before 
games," Sugg said. "They each give 
different speeches to pump us up." 

Although the women are begin-
ning to feel the difficulty of balanc-
ing academics and athletics with 
schoolwork mounting up, they're 
having a great time together with 
the team. "We do lose time to be 
included in some of the freshmen 
activities like hanging out with suit-
emates, but the team has really 
become like my family," Sugg said. 

McManus is optimistic about 
the impact that the freshmen will 
have in the future. 

"The freshmen have all con-
tributed to the team in a very big 
way. They're definitely exceeding 
our expectations and will be a big 
part in the team's future as well," 
McManus said. "We lost only one 
senior last year but we added some 
great new players to our roster." 

With the playoffs beginning on 
Nov. 7, the gi rls aren't looking too 
far ahead - yet. 

"We're taking each game one 
at a time," McManus said.

know, the game is played 
between twO people that count 
to three and then each deliver 
one of three hand signals, which 
include Rock (a clo ed fist), 
Paper (a n open pal m) and 
Scissors (mimicking a pair of 
scissors with two fingers - the 
RPS Society gets technical 
about the position and angl e 
between the fingers, but 1 don 't 
thi nJc we need to get into all 
that). Roele wins against 
Scissors, loses to Paper and 
stalemates against itself. Paper 
beats Rock, gets cut up by 
Sci ors and draws when up 
against i~elf. Finally, Sci ors 
beats Paper, is crushed by Rock 
and ties again t itself. 

According to the rules of the 
game, each throw beats one and 
loses to one other, and therefore 
they are all eqU2l. 

However, there are still some 
people who believe that the 
game involves strategy. These 
are the guys - the members of 
the RPS Society - th2t call 
themselves professional RPS 
players, and dUn.Ir there is acticaI 
approach in • pme (/ hip-low. 

The RPS Society says one 
strategy of Rock-Paper- cissor 
lie in the characteristics of the 
throws. Apparently, the Rock is 
conceived as an aggressive move 
because it is associated with fist-
fights , while Paper has the per-
ception of feeble 8.5-by- 11 inch 
documents and denotes a subtle 
attack. Scissors, often used to 
construCt things, i conceived as 
a crafty move. So during a 
game, if your opponent delivers 
Rock, you know he is making a 
forcef\Jl, powerful gesture -
but I don't see how that gives 
you better than a 33 percent of 
gue sing hi next move. 

Another strategy is learning 
your opponent and figuring out 
what he might do next. In that 
case, Mi Cleo might mak.e for 
a good RPS player. 

The sillin of Rock-Paper-
Scissors was re flected in the 

ct. 26 event. The RPS 
Championships had referees to 
make sure no one threw a Roper 
(a half-scissor and lulf-paper 
signal), and there were precau-
tions to prevent injury. Also,

Big 3 vault team into rankings 
Golf will go to break ranked No.4 in D-II 

By JOE SPANO 
Staff Writer 

UCSD's golf squad has been 
consistently led by three golfers 
thi season, senior Alan Scheer, 
and juniors Joe Dolby and Brian 
Duckworth , who have hel ped the 
team earn a fourth-place national 
ranking in Divisio n [I. Both 
Scheer and Duckworth have two 
first-place finishes on the team so 
far this season, and Dolby rook 
second place for the team in the 
first tournament of the year. 

"AI, Joe and Brian will travel 
wi th us most of the year," head 
coach Mike Wydra said. "They 
provide competitive support, and 
they're just great guys to have on 
the team, they make it a lot of 
fun." 

Scheer, the team captain, is 
probably the Tritons most accom-
plished golfer: He i ranked I 18th 
out of golfers in all divisions, and 
is currently ranked 14th among 
Division 11 golfers. 

"AI is getting more comfort-
able with his swi ng, and after he 

Big three 

had a 68 in his fi nal round at a 
tournament in UC Davis last year, 
1 predicted he would have a big 
summer," Wydra said. "Of course 
r had no idea to what extent he 
would, as he qualified to compete 
in the U.S. Amateurs . H e is really, 
really good, and getting better all 
the time. I just can't say enough 
about him." 

If his coach can't say enough 
about him, his teammates can. 

"AI i just a great guy to hang 
out with," Dolby said. "And its so 
nice to have him around because 
you can count on him to never 
shoot much higher than 72 ." 

So far this year, Scheer has an 
average round score of 72.22, just 
4. 125 strokes off the No. I nation-
ally ranked leader. 

"The U .. Anlateur was just 
an ama zi ng experience," Scheer 
said. "It was a lot of fun, and it's 
somethi ng I'm looking forward to 
goi ng after again next summer, 
and hopefully improving my per-
formance." 

Scheer also has very high 
hopes for the team. 

"It's great to see such a level of 
competition on the team;' Scheer 
said. "This team has high expecta-
tions, and we have a good chance 
to not only make nationals, but 
also to do very well in them." 

Duckworth, who came off his 
last tournament tying with Scheer 
for first on the team, has provided 
a lot of support as the No.2 spot 
on the team. 

"Brian is ungodly long off the 
tee," Wydra said. "He is learning 
to manage the course and his 
game bener too, and is figuring 
out his short game as well. He is 
becoming a real triple threat." 

Duckworth is also the class 
clown of the team, always able to 
provide some comic relief for 
teammates. 

"Brian makes me laugh more 
than anyone," Dolby said. 

Like Scheer, Duckworth was 
nationally ranked after his second 
tournament. 

"Having three solid guys with 
the ability to consistently post low

Fans go 
with the 
underdog 
Cyn City 

Cynthia Chavez 
his year's baseball pennant 
races garnered the highest 
TV rating because 

American were crossing their fin-
gers for the underdogs. The 
Bo ton Red ox and the Chicago 
Cub finally were close to earning 
the chance to win a tide. America 
loves the underdog, especially in 
the world of ports. 

Our hi tory is built on simple, 
common people rising up against 
all odd into triumph. The 
Revolutionary War, or "The 
Rebellion," as the Brits like to term 
it, was a war the colonists weren't 
suppo ed to win. But they did and 
now, for better or worse, America 
icon Idered the richest and most 
powerful nation in the world . 
Perhaps it is becau e of our unique 
beginning that Americans have 
always rooted for the little guys, 
evidenced by the abundance of 
Hollywood films about little guys, 
such as Rocky Balboa, Rudy 
Ruettiger of ore Dame or the 
Hickory Huskers from «Hoosiers." 

America loves it when David 
slays Goliath; thus, it's only fitting 
that the wild-card Florida Marlins 
clinched their econd tide in 
October's Fall Classic. Granted, the 
majority of Americans would've 
rather seen the curse-laden Cubs 
and Red Sox duke It out for the tide, 
especially since neither have won 
since 190 and 1918, respectively. 

evertheless, the wild card Marlins 
won the pennant while the Yankees 
secured the curse of the Bambino by 
crushing Boston's hope of extendmg 
postseason play. TV ratings plum-
meted after the damn Yankees and 
the Fish captured their respective 
pennan . 

I, tOO, was disappointed in the 
outcome and even thought ~bout 
boycotting the World eries. 
However, [ love ba eball tOO much 
and the thought of it ending soon 
was enough for me to tune in and 
watch. "m glad I did because It was 
nice to see the Fish - the team 
that barely won the wild card race 
- take the ode. They were up 
against Golia th , the winnmgest 
profes i nal team to date (record 
26 tides) , nch In history and tradi -
tion, not to mention money. They 
have a staggering $164 million pay-
roll that notonou ' owner George 
Steinbrenner shells out in 
exchange for a ring. On the other 
hand, the Fish have existed for only 
10 years and have a humble $54 
million payroll. This ome, fate was 
on FlOrida' Ide and it seemed that 
the Fi h ju t wanted it more than 
the Yan did. 

Game ix proved a pitching duel 
for the ages with Josh Beckett and 
Andy Pettite taking the mound. A 
23-year-old youngster against a 31-
year-old veteran. An 18-game win-
ner ver us a 149-game winner. A 
filthy curveball versus a handcuffing 
cutter. othmg shon of reviving 
the gho of Ruth, Mantle, Gehrig 
and DtMagglO could bolster the 
lackluster Yankee offense. Becken 
pitched th game of hi li~, turrung 
the Bronx Bombers into the Br nx 
Burns on their very own field .
