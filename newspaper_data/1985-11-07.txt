UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 1985 

By TOM FERGUSON, Staff Wnter 

I T IS A WELL-KNOWN fact that UCSD is one of the most sports-minded campuses in the nation , with extensive programs in physical education , 
athletics and recreation . The departments of campus 
recreation , intercollegiate athletics and physical 
education seek to promote broad programs which 
are conducive to physical and mental health in 
addition to academic productivity. These programs 
meet the different recreational needs of UCSD's 
student body, faculty and staff, but only for the 
current population - the pre ent number of 
students (14,425) and faculty/ staff (12,449) is 
projected to increase over the next 10 years to 
19,000 students with a proportionate growth of 
employees; added to th is is the proposed 
construction of Fifth College. But bigger has never 
meant better. A major problem exists in that the 
present athletic and recreational facilities , which can 
barely withstand the onslaught of current usage , are 
inadequate for this increase. 

At present, recreational programs at UCSD are 
increasingly limited due to insufficient space - for 
example, intramural schedule that run until 1 :00 am. 

After a comprehensive review of existing athletic 
and recreational facilities, Parkin Architects 
recommended that "in order to correct existing 
deficiencies and to meet future demand for 
recreation and ...

UCSD amphitheater 
coming soon 

Chancellor Atkinson has slated 
$1 million of the 25th ' 
Anniversary pledge funds for an 
outdoor amphitheatre that may 
be built at UCSD in the next few 
years. The hkely sae would be 
the finger canyon by the 
Intersection of Johns Hopkins 
and Gilman Drive. 

Lynne Peterson , Director of 
Student Activities at the 
University Events OlTice, hopes 
this amphitheatre will make 
UCSD a community center 
comparable to the many other 
schools, including DSU , whose 
amphaheatres house rock 
concerts, basketball games and 
the symphony. There is at 
present no such factlity on 
campus; both Mandevllle 
Auditorium and the Mandell 
Weiss Theatre can house 
approximately 500. 

The Task AdVISOry Board 
which issued a report on the 
amphitheatre last month studIed 
three separate proposals: a 
covered amphitheatre , an an 
installment designed as pan of 
the Stuart collection. a~d the 
chosen open-air design . 

Peterson saId the covered 
deSign would have been 
preferable as a "great landmark" 
for the school . but would be far 
toO expensive . The proposal 
supported by the Stuan 
Foundation would not be 

BLOOM COUNTY 

versatile enough ; the deSign IS 
unsuitable for many types of 
events. The board recommended 
the third proposal be ause it was 
"the mo t functional ," Peter on 
said . 

The amphitheatre would 
include a covered stage , 10.000 
fixed seats and grass seating for 
approximately 5000 people . 
Much of the natural growth of 
the canyon will be maintained , 
particularly a rim of eucalyptus 
trees. Peterson said the structure 
is deSIgned to mmlmize thc 
destruction of habitat and open 
space, and would even. in her 
opinion, be an aesthetic 
enhancement. 

Peterson and Jeff tei nberg of 
the Planning Department both 
said the plans are tentative at 
present. Steinberg said the 
amphiteatre was "on the back 
burner" because of the large 
number of other higher priority 
construction plans. 

The Chancellor included a 
goal of $1 million for the 
amphitheatre m the plans of the 
25th Anntversary fundralsing 
campaign If thiS amount is 
raised, said Stei nberg, the 
C hancellor will seek the 
additlonal funds necessary. 
Peterson said it is not known 
what the total cost will be. 
although she said guesses could 
be made from the Environmental 
Impact Repon grading figures . 

The final deCision will rest 
with the Regents .

Reduced funding for SAAC organizations 
By DENNIS WOO, News Editor 

FACING AN imminent budget shortfall, the Student Affinnative Action 
Committee (SMC) voted at a 
meeting yesterday to mai ntain 
funding for its seven intems as a 
priority over program funding for 
affirmative action organizations. 

"A lot of organizations have 
relied on SMC as a sole funding 
ource," said Nadir Haqq. 

executive intern for $Me. 
Alternative funding for 

organizational activities is 
available through the AS Council, 

'the International Center, the 
University Events Office (UEO) 
and the college governments said 
Nick Aguilar, Director of Special 
Services. Although funding 
interns would be a priurity , SMC 
will still continue to be a fundmg 
source for programs by cultural 
and affinnative action student 
organizations. SMC is more a 
secondary funding source than a 
primary source, according to 
Haqq. 

Representatives to SMC 
include members from the 

American Indians Student 
Co uncil (AlSC); Asian-Pacific 
Student Alliance ("-PSA); Black 
Students Union ( BSU); Grad uate 
Students Association (GSA); 
MEChA; and the Women's 
Resource Center. With winter 
quarter proposals coming up and 
interns on the payroll , SM C 
representatives were pressed to 
make a decision, according to 
Haqq. The vote was unammous 
to contiue funding for the 
interns. 

"People get confused as to 

what SMCs tunction is." Aguilar 
said . 'SMCs primary charge is 
to be an advisory committee to 
the Vice Chancellor of 
Undergraduate Affairs Uoseph 
Watson)." Haqq said . 

could be affected include 
MECM's Cinco de Mayo 
celebration and the BSU 's 
graduation ceremonies. 

"It was a committee decision 
to establish the internships to 
study affirmative action 
problems." Haqq said . $MCs 
mterns are paid approximately 
$125 per week each . 

AS seeks co-op housing-rep 

LaSt year, seven internships 
were established to aid in 
researching aspects of affirmative 
actions at UCSD, including 
investigating ethnic studies , 
minority recruitment and 
retention , and the Early Outreach 
Program (EOP). ·We·ve never 
had seven interns before . The 
most we've had (at one time) is 
three or four," Aguilar said. 
"SMC has come in under-budget 
m previous years, but we didn't 
anticipate having so many 
interns." 

Haqq said that monetary 
support for cultural groups would 
be directly affected , regardless 
tha t groups could go to other 
sources of funding. Events that 

Other business discussed.at 
the meeting included an opening 
for SMC chairperson . An 
allocation proposal for a banquet 
by the Chinese Students 
Association was rejected because 
"Chinese-American students are 
not listed as a population that 
should benefit from retention 
funding," Aguilar said . If the 
proposal had been for an event 
promoting cultural awareness 
rather than retention , it would 
have received $MC funding,

THE ASSOC IATED Students is seeking a student-at-large for the 
AS Cooperative and Alternative 
Housing Committee. 

"(Some) srudents want to live 
with people who share a 
common interest and 
p hilosophy." said Marla Winitz, 
AS commissioner of Operations 
Services and Enterprises. 
Fraternity, sorority and 
cooperative housing and an 
inte rnational house are among 
the alternatives to be discussed 
and investi2ated by the 
committee, Winitz said. 

The AS Co-op Committee is 
the first 01 its kind at UCSD. The 
committee is headed by Winitz . 
and includes representatives 

from the AS Council, Campus 
Community Planning, Housing 
and Food Services, the Srudent 
Affirmative Action Committee 
(SAAC). the Interfraternity 
Council, the Pan hellenic Council 
and UCSD Co-ops and 
Enterprises. 

The goal of the committee is 
to determine the feasibility of 
alternative housing at UCSD, 
Winitz said . The committee will 
investigate land availability and 
the legali ties behind alternative 
housing. The problems of cost, 
ownersh ip, design and future 
expansion of co-ops will also be 
addressed by the committee. A 
primary issue is whether general 
student funds will be allocated to 

housing projects that benefit co-
op participants exclusively. 

Ariel Anguiano, AS vice 
president of Administration , will 
select the student-at-Iarge 
representative to the committee. 
The representative will be 
required to do research and 
"should be enthusiastic ," 
Anguiano said. In addition , 
Anguiano is looking for a 
representative who will be at the 
un iversity fo r the next two to 
three years and has background 
experience in construction 
planning and archi tecture. 

The com mittee will begi n 
meeting in two weeks after the 
student-at-Iarge representative is 
selected. (lj

The sporting art of constructing complexes 
"Yes, Virginia , sports do exist at UCsD." 
Athletes, coaches, and intramural maniac - your prayers are finally 

answered, or at least listened to. A new $60 million sports center with 
football, baseball and soccer fields, tennis ourts, weight rooms, a new 
track and field and swimming pools is now in the works. It's about 
time this tomb of libraries and lecture halls broke loose , but, even 
though the interest is there, the extravagant plans don't quite hit the 
mark. 

Our teams have to abandon their Division 1lI standing; it's too 
uncompetitive for a school our size, and move up to Division I or 11. 
Men's soccer, baseball and women's volleyball all have to play teams 
in these upper divisions to get a good game as it is, why nor just 
make it official? 

pending $60 million will also increase the pressure to get a serious 
sports program at UCsD started, to initiate a football team and do a 
major upgrading of our current teams. You can't justify spending so 
much money just so students won't have to wait 20 minutes for a free 
racquetball court. Also, the plans for a 7,500 set outdoor arena rely on 
the hope that 7,500 people will come watch a game. Right now it's a 
rare occasion if half the gym is ever filled. 

What will a university with only 15,000 students and a Division 1II 
athletic program do with a multi-million dollar faCility? The only 
sports taken seriously at this school involve two flags strapped around 
a person's waist or a flying disc of plasti . Granted, our current 
facilities stink, ask anyone who has played innenube watemolo at 
midnight or has run a 'down-and-out-and-down-again' pass pattern on 
Pryatel field, but pumping money into neat new racketball courts won't solve 
everything. A good athletIC program needs good athletes and coaches. 
Because UCsD is a Division III school and has decided to put its 
scholarship money into academics instead of athletics, top notch 
atheletes are not beating down {he door to get into this school and 

And once the meal is over who's going to pay the bill? Who else , 
students will . Of course there are hopes that corporations will donate 
certain facilities , such as the United States Tennis Association 
building quality courts, but when it comes right down to it, the bulk 
of the cost will be absorbed in student registration fees. So students 
are going to have to decide. Do they want just modem facilities or 
quality athletes and staff plus the hardware? 

UCSD is nor UCLA or even UC Davis. Our sports program does 
our coaching staff, many of whom must now work on the outside to 
support themselves, suffers because of it. If the university is not

frUits of capitalism and even the 
professor of Marxist-Leninist 
theory develops an appetite. 
More damaging than the prose, 

ewsweek also featured a 
photograph of Mr. Gorbachev 

holding a drink to his momh 
and casting an admiring glance 
at Mrs. Fabius, wife of the 
French preSident. The caption 
said that Gorbachev had a taste 
for finer things. 

The bias in Newsweek's 
coverage was so blatant that it is 
hard to find it truly 
obJeCtIonable. The stuff makes 
for entertaining reading. I have 
yet 10 see anyone become truly 
enraged by an article In the 
NatIOnal EnqUirer . It Simply is nOl 
worth the effon. One accepts it 
for what it is - entertaining 
smut. It is not what is said , or 
implied about the Gorbachevs to 
which I object, as much as the 
media's relentless focus on the 
Gorbachevs or, for that matter, 
Reagan. By focusing attention on 
the leaders as individuals, the 
determinant factor in the success 

or failure of the meetings are the 
men (and their wives). It 
becomes difficult to see the 
summit meeting as it should be 
seen - an 0rportunity, or 
expression 0 the desire to 
resolve problems in the 
international system through the 
cooperation of its most powerful 
nations - when the media 
persists in presenting it as a 
prize fight. 

Viewed in this light , the 
engagement becomes decidedly 
adversarial, a zero-sum game in 
which there can be only one 
victor. The context that is being 
set for the meeting IS helping to 
ensure its doom. 

The propensiry to equate all 
the recent actions of both leaders 
with "chip-stacking" Significantly 
ups the stakes. When an 
administration official , 

explaining Reagan's mOlives for 
meeting with select Third World 
leaders at the U.N. said, "It is 
mostly 10 indicate to the Soviets 
that we . toO, have strong tks 
with South Asia." The N. Y. Times 
analysis read, "The senior 
admmistration ofTicial said the 
cho ice of India and Pakistan was 
Intended to send a 'strong Signal' 
to the Soviet Union abom the 
commitment of the United States 
to the Third World nations in 
advance of the summit meeting 
between Mr. Reagan and the 
Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev 
in Geneva on Nov. 19-20. 

Higher stakes make the game 
more exciting, but in the nuclear 
era when total annihilation 
remains a very real possib iliry, I 
wish that the mass media would 
pursue lower odds. Il:3

Being a fee-paYJng student at 

UCSD, I feel that It IS my 
obligation as such to brIng the 
following matter to the attenuon 
of the proper authorities 

On the morning of Fnday. 
OCI 25 , 1985 , at 7 :30 am, I 
emerged from the Media Center 
(Third College) after a long night 
of video-tape editing only to find 
a cnatlon on my vehicle for an 
expIred meter (the time on the 
citation IS 7 27). My complaint IS 
that the "offi cer's" vehicle 
(license #E862128) that CIted my 
car was parked In a red zone 
directly adjacent to my car, a 
second ·officer's" vehicle (hcense 
1tE862125) was parked In a 
metered spot which was expired. 
I noted that at 7:30 am, both 
"officers" were in the Third 
College dining hall drinking 
coffee and shooting the breeze. 

An hour and a quarter later 

(845 am), the rwo "officers" were 
slIll sItting at the same table. sull 
dnnklng coffee, still shooting the 
breeze . 

I am told that these vehicles 
are exempt from restriction such 
as red zones. metered spots , etc . 
What angers me is the fact thal 
these "officers" can find the time 
to write citations for students' 
cars on their way to coffee , park 
in what I perceive to be an Illegal 
manner, and then Sit around for 
over an hour on what IS probably 
paid time and talk aboUl 
whatever it is that "lIcket-wrlters" 
talk about. 

This has been gOing on for 
qUlle some time . as many of my 
friends have had similar 
expenences. I have witnesses 
that will attest to the fact that my 
Slory IS a true one . 

It IS my strong belief that these 
"officers '" actions are 
questionable at besl and , at 
worst, a flagrant abuse of 
authority. Action should be taken 
promptly so that such Violations 

can be brought to a grinding 
halt.

he has explained "the facts" to 
Patti Orozco. 

M r. Thomas, the truth IS that 
as a man in our SOCiety you have 
power and privilege - whether 
you choose to adm it it or not. 
Feminism IS not a dead Issue 
and It never will be. Fifteen 
thousand women did not go to 
an International conference In 
Nairobi thiS summer to celebrate 
the equality they have achieved . 
They were there to discuss the 
state of the world's women and 
steps toward eradicating the 
economic. social and political 
inequalities women face in every 
City In the world . 

You seem to feel that because 
women are In hemlstry classes 
at UC D all women "have come 
a long wa}'." The women who 

make It into UCSD or attain 
degrees in any university are a 
minoriry of the female 
population. The fact is that for 
women in general , and women 
of color in particular, inequality 
in pay, sexual harassment , and 
subordinate treatment 
accompany the daily struggle to 
get by in occupations that pay 
low wages solely because they are 
held by women. It is a fact that a 
woman 's college degree will earn 
her the same wage as a man's 
high school diploma. I fail to see 
the equality in this sltuallon . 

It is repeatedly reiterated that 
women have made tremendous 
gains In the past decade. 
Granted , there have been 
changes; it would be ahlStofl al 
to say there have nol. But the 
reality of our current times IS 
that women's nghts arc being 
eroded daily by the ever 
increilslng conservatism of this 
country; a conservatism that 
Ronald Reagan IS unceaSingly 
attempting to put IntO legislalJon . 

Feminists do not hate men or 
want 10 be like men . We are 
fighting for what is rightfully ours 
- a li fe free of abuse and 
discnmina li on; a life free of rape 
and ViOlent attack; a life where 
our opinions as women are 
respected and va lued, not 
negated and dismissed. 

It is the opinion , such as 
yours, that "all IS well" that does 
women a great disservice and 
that works to perpetuate our 
Inequality. Sue Rochman

CTB treaty: a viable option? 

Toward banning all nuclear explosions 
By DA VlD MOUTOUX 

National security 
considerations have always 
weighed heavily on the minds of 
those in power, as well they 
should. Thus much of the reason 
for a continuing nuclear arms 
race has been the fear that 
national security wold be 
threatened if one side relaxed its 
research and development effons 
while allowing the other side to 
continue , and therefore achieve 
some kind of nuclear superiority. 

The pursu it of nuclear 
superiority, however, could easily 
be .cunailed, and the anns race 
thus slowed considerably, were a 
comprehensive and verifiable 
ban on all nuclear explosions 
adopted by all nuclear nations. A 
comprehensive test ban (CTB) is 
not only posSible but imminently 
practical and would btnefit all 
nations by increasing national as 
well as international security. 
Indeed , a convincing case for a 
CTB can be easily rrtade in 
several points. 

The first and most imponant 
rationale for a comprehensive 
test ban is the halting of nuclear 
weapons development. Weapons 
engineers all agree that without 
exploding nuclear devices, new 
types of weapons systems are 
impossible to design. A CTB 
would therefore halt the 
qualitative arms race by stopping 
the only means for warhead 

development - testing. This 
step is panicularly important 
now as both sides are begi!ming 
extensive development on so-
called Third Generation nuclear 
weapons like Enhanced 
Radiation weapons, EMP bombs, 
microwave weapons and x-ray 
lasers, which focus the power of 
nuclear weapons rather than 
letting the force escape in aU 
directions. Ending development 
would thus end the search for 
these more sophisticated , more 
"usable ," nuclear weapons . Had a 
CTB been negotiated back when 
Kennedy proposed the Limited 
Test Ban Treaty in the early 60s, 
as part of an on-going process to 
ultimately end testing, we would 
not be threatened today by 
highly accurate and destabiliZing 
MIRVs, ICBMs and cruise 
missiles. 

Secondly, a CIB would help 
considerably in halting the 
proliferation of nuclear weapons 
to non-nuclear nations. By 
ending all nuclear explosions, 
the nuclear-armed nations would 
lend much-needed credibility to 
their effons to halt the spread of 
nuclear weapons technology. The 
1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty 
pledges Its 127 signers "to 
pursue negOtiations in good faith 
on effective measures relating to 
the cessation of the nuclear arms 

race at an early date ." The most 
effective measure that could be 
achieved now is a ban on all 
nuclear explosions. 

By entering into such a ban, 
the nuclear weapons nations 
would take the first step to fulfi II 
their 1968 pledge, demonstrating 
their commitment to 
disarmament. and at long last 
setting a positive example for 
nations trying to develop nuclear 
weapons. Some nations believe 
they tOO have the right to 
possess nuclear weapons as long 
as the US and the USSR are 
vigorously engaged in an 
unconstrained effon to develop 
newer and deadlier weapons. 

One of the concerns about a 
CTB is that it might lock the US 
into a position of military 
inferiority relative to the Soviet 
Union. Actually, despite recent 
exaggerations of Soviet 
capabilities, many respected US 
military officials and scientists 
agree that the United States has 
had , and continues to have , a 
Significant technologial 
advantage in almost all categories 
of nuclear weaponry. In fact , 
from the narrow perspective of 
the anns competition, a ban on 
all nuclear explosions would 
actually work to the advantage of 
the US. To date , the US has 
conducted 200 more tests than 
has the Soviet Union. It is widely 

agreed that the US has an edge 
on the Soviets in developing 
compact, efficient and reliable 
nuclear warheads. An end to all 
testing would preserve this US 
lead . Continued testing will 
erode it. 

AnOther concern about a CTB 
is verification, which in the past 
has been a major obstacle to 
substantive arms control. Both 
the US and the Soviet Union, 
however, possess the 
technological means for assured 
verification. In fact. through the 

" 

years of negotiations, scie ntist 
have developed a technical 
system for determining the size 
and source of seismic events. 
which consists of a worldwide 
network of "seismic listening 
pOStS," and exchange of data, 
satellite surveillance and other 
national technical means. "We 
are certain that the state of 
knowledge of seismlogy and the 
techniques for monitoring 
seismic events could soon detect 
clandestine testing programs 
involving explosions as small as 
one kiloton," geologists Dr. Jack 
Evemden of the National Center 
for Earthquake Research and Dr. 
Lynn Sykes of Columbia 
University reponed in the 
Scientific Amtrican in 1982. Many 
of the nation's leading scientists 
and military and arms control 
experts have anested to the fact, 
in their writings for technical 
journals, in interviews, and in 
testimony before congressional 
committees, that any large-.scale 
-c heating would be detected 
before it yielded military benefits. 

Regarding current stockpile 
reliability, experienced scientists 
strongly dispute the alleged need 
to verify US weapons reliablility 
through test firing. A letter from 
Norris Bradbury , former director 
for Los Amamos Laboratory, 
Richard Garwin, a physicist with 
considerable weapons experience 
and J. Carson Mark, former head 
of the theoretical division at Los 
Alamos, written to then President 
Jimmy Caner, stares: "The 
assurance of continued 
operability of stockpiled nuclear 
weapons has in the past been 
achieved almost exclusively by 
non-nuclear testing . . . It has 
been rare to the point of non-
exsistence tor a problem revealed 
by the sampling and inspection 
program to require a nuclear test 
for its resolution ." 

However, any long-term 
stockpile deterioration that might 
occur would, of course, affect 
both sides equally under a 
mutual, verifiable cessation of 
nuclear explosions. Also 
important about stockpile 
deterioration is the fact that a 
nation contemplating a first-
strike would not have the high 
degree of confidence which 
would be required for any hope 
of success. By contrast, the 
nation launching a retaliatory 
strike would not need the same 
kvelofconfidence in the 
preciSion and reliability of its 
weapons to do so effectively. A 
CTB would therefore help to

threat. 

The implementation of a 
verifiable comprehensive test ban 
treaty has been supported by 
every president from Eisenhower 
to Carter. It is in the national 
security interest of the United 
States to resume negotia tions on 
a CIB treaty, which were 
suspended in 1980 and then 

forrnally ended in 1982 by 
President Reagan. Furthermore, 
the ratification of the Peaceful 
Nuclear Explosions Treaty and 
the Threshold Test Ban Treaty -
treaties that were negotiated and 
signed but never ratified -
would prOVide for unprecedented 
geologic and seismological data 
exchanges, access to testing sites 
and noninterference in 
monitoring, which together 
would break the traditional 
Soviet barrie rs to on-site 
inspection of their testing 
facilities and provide vastly 

greater confidence in limiting 
Soviet nuclear testing. 

The ratification of the TTBT 
and PNET would also restore 
confide nce in the arms control 
process and help negotiations 
toward a complete cessation of 
all nuclear explosions. Indeed , 
the upcoming summit should 
provide an historical opportunity 
for both leaders to begin serious 

discussions about the importance 
of past nuclear treaties and 
resume negotiations towards a 
CTB treaty. 

A logical next step, after the 
nuclear explosions moratorium 
had been rrtade permanent by an 
international treaty, might be a 
similar ban on the flight testing 
of nuclear missilies. followed by 
a complete halt to the 
deployment of new nuclear 
weapons . This kind of step by 
step process could prove 
effective in helping to finally 
curb the nuclear arms race. rzJ

College students highest suicide risk 
By EVA C. WONG 

At the (lme of her sUIcide 
attempt, Jennifer (not her real 
name) was at the Universiry of 
Texas, a college with over 50.000 
students. She fell as If she was a 
number and a "nobody" and 
"everything." she saId , 
contributed 10 her depreSSIOn 
Jennifer felt Isolated because she 
had nor felt palllcularly close 10 
her roommates. all of whom 
seemed 10 have boyfrIends when 
she never did and she was not 
making friends ; those people 
that she had known from hIgh 
school were makIng new friends. 
and it was rare 10 see familar 
faces on a campus as large as 
UT. 

Because of her depression and 
feelings of inadequacy, she 
decided she had to do 
something. jennifer's depression 
was consuming her. to the point 
that it hindered and influenced 
every facet of her life to such an 
unbearable point that she would 
nor be able 10 get out of bed in 
the morning, much less attend 
classes. Since she saw her hfe as 
nOl only stagnant but getting 
worse day by day, she thought of 
a way to kill herself and end all 
the mIsery. 

She knew of pIlls that would 
do the Job, because she had 
once aCCIdently taken too many 
of them and was put into a 
coma, but tWO thIngs sropped 
her from tao ing them. One 
reason she decided against 
suicide was that an effort to 
muster up the energy to get out 
of bed. to put on clothes and 

drive to the pharmacy to get the 
pills. The other reason which 
caused her 10 think twi ce about 
committIng SUICIde was the effe t 
It would ha\'e on her mother "I 
though of what it would do to 
her and I JUSt couldn't do that. " 

oon after her attempt. 
Jennifer rook a quarter off from 
school for a change of 
atmosphere , but she was still 
depressed, because at home she 
felt even more isolated from 
people. According to her, "It was 
an efTort to get up the energy to 
make a peanut butter and jelly 
sandwich ... putting the stuff, 
the peanut butter and jelly away, 
was so much that I would start to 
cry." Her morher saw the 
desperate state Jennifer was in 
and through her intelVention , 
jennifer got profeSSional 
counseling to help her with her 
problem. 

jennifer came 10 UCSO last 
year, feeling more able La cope 
with the college atmosphere than 
in the past. "I felt a lor more 
mature, than I did two years 
ago." In addition , she found 
UCSO different from the 
university she was previously 
attending. It was not just that 
UCSO was a smaller school, but 
she says that she couldn't believe 
the ovetall "welcomeness" she 
felt, and the instant closeness the 
RAs, counse lors, SUltemates and 
dorm mates presented. 

Or. John Giebink, Director of 
UCSO's Psychological Services. 
agrees with Jennifer in that 
UCSO's student body and faculty 

Suicides by people in their late teens to mid-20s have increased 
300 percent in the last 20 years - Dr. John Giebinh, UCSD 
Psychological Services Director. 

"for the most part over the years 
seem to be responSive to people 
in trouble; and I'm aware of a 
number of incidences where 
students were in fact ,suicidal or 
suicidally inclined and where it 
(suicide) did not come about 
simply because their friends and 
acquaintances are the people 
wh.o responded to them ." 

jennifer has been to UCSD's 
Psychological Services and said 
they do excellent work , but 
because of the demand on their 
selVices, each student is limited 
to ten initial visits. However, if 

more counseling is needed , they 
will refer you to someone else or 
suggest someone for you to see 
off campus. 

Reacting to suicide 

According to Giebink, the 
percentage of people who visit 
Psychological Services on their 
own accord, compared to the 
percentage of people who are 
referred by either friends or 
relatives, runs about 50-50. Each 
year 14 to IS percem of UCSD 
students use Psychological 
Services on either a one-to-one 
basis or in-group counseling. 
Other programs, such as those 
on stress reduction, reach 
another 20 percent of the 
students. Notably, Giebink says 
that in the course of the four 
years a student attends UCSO, 
50-60 percent of them will have 

By EVA C.WONG 
After a suicide at UCSO, 

Psychological Services was on the 
scene to talk to those who were 
traumatized by what they 
witnessed. According (Q Dr. John 
Giebink, guilt is usually the inital 
emotion because friends , family 
and acquaIntances ask 
themselves , "How could I have 
helped to prevent him or her 
from doing this?" After Stephen 
Thomas Robens' self·immolation , 
Psychological Services talked to a 
few individuals who witnessed 
the incident. Comparatively, 
several hundred people went in 
to talk to counselors available at 
the Muir Cafeteria, as well as in 
the dorms and apartments , about 
what they saw and how it 
affected them after the other 
suicide on campus last year, 
when a UCI medical student 
took her own life by jumping off 
Tioga. 

Robens' suicide affected many 
people on campus which is 
evident. for instance, in this 
excerpt from a letter, primed in 
The Guardian , written by 
Bronwen Ray. "It is disturbing to 
me that this person would choose 
to take his life ... I do not know 
what would drive a person to do 
this. There is everything to live 
for. The image of this man 
burning is very vivid in my 
mind. I cannot think of anything 
more tragic or striking than the 
choice this man made ... I do 
not piry him. I am saddened 
because I think he rrtade a 
mistake. I respect the life he 
lived ." 

.. ':. ' .. . . 

Roberts, a non-student, set 
himself afire last S"pring outside 
Central Library. Roberts was said 
to have been depressed over 
family and money problems but 
why he had decided to die by 
such a rare and painful method 
of suicide was another question 
in itself. "Burning oneself is 
probably the most painful , 
hideous way to commit suicide. 
Roberts must have known exactly 
what he was doing and have had 
a good reason for It ... that 
reason is just a complete mystery 
to us," Sergeant Robert Jones told 
reporters , 

A few weeks later, Roberts' 
family wrote in a letter to the 
opinions editor at Guardian with 
their explanation for Roberts' 
suicide. "We believe all who were 
touched by this tragic event 
deserve some explanation of its 
meaning ... (he) was a serious, 
independent student of Hegel , 
Nietzsche, Spinoza and the 
Greeks ... he was caught up in 
the frusrrations of his time in not 
being able to make a 
difference .,. his ultimate protest 
was to show the irrational 
components of human nature , .. 
and the very real possibiliry that 

. 

', . . 

'. 

..... 

. .... 

- . . .. 

". " . .. 

erstWhile rational individuals 
could bring destruction to us all." 

After the letter from the 
Roberts' family had been 
published. William G. Wixted !II 
wrote to the editor and rather 
than discussing how the act of 
Roberts' suicide had affected 
him , he focused on what he saw 
as a preventive solution - guard 
UCSD from an influx of 
transients. ·Several other students 
and I put out the flames as 
quickly as we could with our 
coats, but we were too late to 
save the man. He died rwelve 
hours later. The next day. whIle 

had some SOrt of encounter with 
Psychological SelVices. 

This year Jennifer is living off-
campus with three roommates 
and seems readil)' able 10 speak 
of her past problems with 
people. From looking at Jennifer 
it is hard to believe that she was 
once suicidal, yet there is not 
one category of people that 
rypify suicide victims, since each 
indiVIdual is different , as is each 
suicide and the reasons leading 
to it, says Giebink. Although , he 
adds, there are some similar 
characteristics among suicidal 
candidates, including anxiery, 
feelings of inferiority, hostiliry, 
and guilt. According to Giebink, 
"There is a loss behind serious 
depression. the loss can be of a 
loved one, loss of self-esteem, 
self-worth .. . there are different 
reasons for different people ." 

College age students are most 
at risk as they are usuaUy in 
transition between dependent 
child/adolescent and an 
independent adult, states 
Giebink. Suicides of people in 
the late-teens to mid-20s have 
increased 300 percent over the 
past 20 years in the US and in 
other parts of the world as well , 
such as japan and Sweden. 
Giebink notes, "Suicide is also 
the second leading cause of 
death of college age men, second 
only to death caused by trauma 
sustained in accidents, of which 
a fraction are suicides in 
disguise ." However, the 
proportion of attempted sui~ides 
to successful ones among college 
age individuals is approxirrtately 
50 to 1. 

Men and women manifest 
their depression in different 
ways, though both men and 
women become rrtarkedly 

Please tum to PIIC 7 

detailing my account of the 
incident to our police 
depanment ... I asked them why 
more wasn't done to keep 
transients off the campus. One 
sees the transients all over this 
campus. In the weight room, in 
the gym and especially in all of 
the libraries. The incident I 
experienced will definitely not be 
the last with transients on this 
campus. It l'eems that the 
administf?tion, which spends 
most of its time acquiring multi -
million dollar research grants, is 
totaUy unconcerned with 
arranging adequate security for 
the UCSo campus." 

Wixted did not state his views 
on suicide in his letter, and was 
criticized about its contents in 
later letters to the editor. In 
response, in a recent interview, 
he expressed his feelings on 
suicide in generaL "I kind of 
think that if people want to kiD 
themselves they should be 
allowed to. Suicide should be a 
person's right, just like abonion 
should be a person's right, that's 
the way I believe it. I'm kind of 
an indiVidualist, but suicide is 
against the law, I think . .. and I 
think it's within a person's right 
to (commit suicide), but [ think 
he (Roberts) could have chosen a 
better way to do it, a better 
place, and a better time ... he 
was obviously a very sick person 
mentaUy, and contrary to what 
the opinions editor, Matthew

seclusive. college age women as 
well as women in genera\. usually 
talk about their depression 
somewhat more than men do. 
Giebink does not know the exact 
statistics on successful suicides 
between the sexes, but he 
guesses the ratio of men 's 
suicides to those of women 's 
runs either about 2 to 1 or 3 to 
2. 

Because of the stigma attached 
to suicides, it is difficult to keep 
a concise record of self-inflicted 
deaths. The American 
Association of SUiCidology 
estimates about 35,000 suicides a 
year in the US, of which 10,000 
are between the ages of fifteen 
and thiny-four. But the true 
figure of total number of suicides 
is believed to be closer to 
100,000 per year, since many are 
reponed as accidents or in such 
a way as to cover up the actual 
cause of death . 

There are an average of rwelve 
successful suicides per 100,000 
college students, Giebink said , 
al]d UCSO being a university of 
14.000 averages one to rwo 
suicides in the academic year. 
According to Giebink there are 
no specific peak times when 
sucides are likely (Q occur. it 
varies from the first day of 
classes to June. 

self-immolation. Giebink 
hestitates to discuss the ways 
self-inflicted death occur 
because , ·someone might be 
suicidal. they might be thinking 
of ways to kill themself. But if 
they haven't come across a way, I 
don 't want to be any part of 
It." ~

it was very unfortunate for his 
family." 

Wixted says the reason he 
wrote what he did in his letter to 
the editor was "because, "(i f it 
was a student rather than a 
transient who committed 
suicide) I probably wouldn't have 

written the letter at all, but the 
reason I did write it was that in 
my years at UCSD I had quite a 
number of expe riences with 
transients sleepi ng in dorms, 
sleeping in the libraries and 
practically lIVIng on the UCSD 
campus. To me It doesn't seem 
like a feasible situation if that's 
what our society chooses (Q do 
wllh these people , to ignore 
them and JUSt let them wander 
around ." 

Wixted adds, "But my concern 
is for the transients and also for 
the students at UCSD, because 
maybe next time it will be a 
transient taking a students' lIfe 
rather than taking his own life. 

I Basically I think UCSD's security 
is not that great. The 
administration and the student 
government kind of ignore the 
fact of what's happening." 

It has been eight months since 
Wixted helped extinguish the 
flames that engulfed Roberts . and 
now he says the incident never ' 
reaUy enters his mind . "For about 
rwO weeks, I was a little freaked -
OUt, after that, I never really 
thought about it. Except for , he 
adds, "It's a nice Story to tell your 
friends at night and freak them 
out."

thinks that Roberts had been 
afire for more than a minute 
since he noticed the flame as he 
was walking towards Central 
Library. 

Wixted says, "By the time I 
realized what was happening ... 
you just kind of react, you don't 
think about it. If I had thought 
about it, maybe I wouldn't have 
run the chance of possibly 
catching myself on fire while 
putting out the flames. But when 
someone's in trouble , it's kind of 
instinctive in some people. Other 
people's reaction is to scream 
and cry like the CSO girl was 
doing." 

Roberts' suiCIde in Itself did 
not cause a big controversial 
reaction within the student body, 
but It was felt . evident by the 
voiced reactions of those who 
witnessed the suicide and those 
whose lives were changed by It. 
This in tum , caused others to 
think about the reasons behind 
his choice to die , some of those 
reasons outlined in letters to the 
editOr. 

The ways in which UCSO 
students try to commit suicide 
are comparable to elsewhere: 
they range from jumping and 
drug overdoses to a rare case of . 

Life Flight helicopter transports self-immolated body of Steven 
Roberts from Central Library to UCSD Medical Hospital last spring. 

According to Wixted , after 
Roberts finaUy fell down and 
rolled over on his back, he and a 
few other guys used the ir coats 
and jackets to stop the burning. 
Up until that point no one was 
really domg anything because 
Roberts was standing engulfed in 
rwelve foot high flames. Wixted 

In 1970, when George Winne, 
a UCSD graduate student, died 
of self-immolation on Revelle 
Plaza to protest the Vietnam 
War. people clearly saw that he 
killed himself over a political 
cause he deeply believed in. 
Winne was said by his friends to 
"possess his own very deep and 
sincere moral and political views, 
which included a vehement 
opposition to the war." A campus 
memorial in the eucalyptus grove 
near Central Library 
co mmemorates Winne's act. But 
what about Roberts' suicide, have 
people forgotten, or has it caused 
people to think. to reevaluate 
their conception of death by 
choice? ~

Within the last year. eXlen Ive 
plans have been made to 
upgrade the conditions of 
exi ting indoor and outdoor 
facilities and to expand upon the 
number of areas available for use 
by the present and future UCSD 
populace. The Campus 
Community Planning Committee 
has given its approval for the 
development of three new sites 
for recreational facilities. A 
master plan has been 
implemented for these three sites 
to be located: (I) nonh of Third 
College, (2) behind Canyonview 
and (3) at Olson Field (the 
baseball field ).

and field faCility will featurc 400-

limited spectator seating, the 
mfield bemg used for 
recreational field sports; this 
facility will replace the existing 
one at Warren College, and will 
bring UCSD up to NCAA 
collegiate standards. The tennis 
complex, with its 16 courtS, will 
accomodate the playing of 
simultaneous intercollegiate 
matches (men's and women's) in 
addition to NCAA 
championships , teaching clinics 
and camps. All of the areas of

Nonh Campus Recreation Area) 
whIch is proposed to be bUilt 
hetween John Hopkms Dnve and 
Old Highway 10 I (the north 
entrance to LJCSD), north of the 
uper Computer Center. Parkm 

Architects, the company that 
designed UCLA's Wooden 
Center, drafted the master plan 
which was then submllted to the 
AdviSOry Committee to 
Implement the Approved ports 
and Recreation Master Plan . a 
committee appomted by Joseph 

Watson. The plan states that thc 
area north of Third "IS Ideall), 
Sized and onenu:d for

proposed that multiple recre,ltlon 
and athletics fa !lilies be 
constructed there , mcludmg a 
recrearion and athlellcs cemer, 
tWO multi -use fields , a track and 
fIeld facility and a Slxtcen-court 
tennis complex. 

The recreallon and athlellcs 
center will be located 
immediately north of the 
computer center, and will be the 
nucleus of the recreational area , 
prOVIding the following: a three-
coun gymnasium, weight trammg 
rooms, racquetball and squash 
cou rts, lockers and showers, a 
multi-purpose wood floor area, a 
matted floor aCllvlty room, 
human performance laboratories 
and office space. North of the

Accordlllg to Ben Kobayashi , 
director of campus recreation 
and chairman of the AdviSOry 
Committee, before construction 
of the new complex can begin , 
the "first action ... is to take care 
of existing facilities." At present.

The Tritons are hoping the stands will onr, again be full at Warren Fie/d. UCSD faCts Colorado at 2 pm. 

Playoffs start Friday 
T HE UCSD Tritons will be hosting the first-ever soccer playoffs held 
at UCSD this Friday and Sunday 
when they host Colorado 
College, Claremont Mudd Scripps 
and the College of St. Thomas 111 
the NCAA Division III Men's 
Soccer Midwest-Far West 
ReglOnals. 

Claremont Mudd (15-1-2) will 
be taking on St. Thomas (13-0-2) 
in the 11 am Friday match, 
while UCSD (19-0-1) takes on 

Colorado College at 2 pm that 
day. AU the games will be played 
on Warren Field. The 
championship game will be 
played between the two winners 
on Sunday at 1 pm. 

Should UCSD win the 
regionals, they will advance to 
the quarterfinals and may even 
host them. First. however, they 
must get by Claremont, the team 
who has ended each of the last 
twO years ror the T ricons. 
Another factor is the crowd 

turnout. "I think that if we can 
get a big crowd out," says coach 
Derek Armstrong, "the rest will 
take care of itself. Weather-wise, 
we have the best advantage of 
all. Now all we have to do is 
prove to the committee that this 
is the venue they want." 

The championship gumes will 
be played at one or the 
participant's home sights on 
December 7 and 8.

THIS 
YOU: 

A work in process ••• 
by daniel thomas 

Friday morning of last week, Ross 
Wassermann sat for a few minutes over 
coffee and grapefruit juice in the Che 
Cafe patio outside the Guardian offices, 
and discussed with Hiatus the "process 
project" of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night. 
Wassermann, an MFA student at 
UCSD, is directing the play, which opens 
tomorrow night at the Warren Theatre. 
For both this weekend and next (Nov. 
15, 16, 17), the show will play on Friday 
and Saturday at 8 pm and Sunday at 7 
pm. 

Wassermann is a native of Manhattan 
and veteran of dramatic work there, Last 
spring, in his first year here at UCSD, he 
directed the Maria ~rene Fornes' play 
Mud, and this past summer atthe La Jolla 
Playhouse he was assistant director to 
Des McAnuff for Anton Chekhov's The 
Sea Gull. 

According to Drama Department 
publicity this "verse project" of T~eJiLh _ 
Night will "explore the realtionship of 
Shakespeare's play (both) to the 
Elizabethan society which gave it birth, 
and to the society of the 1980s which has 
shaped the perceptions of the actors, 
directors and designers as well as the 
audiences who will view it. The objective 
is to investigate the process of directing, 
acting and designing Shakespeare rather 
than producing Shakespeare." 

In the interview Wassermann 
explained more deeply the difference 
between process and product: "In a 
production, at least as we know it here, 
director and designer". get together a 
concept for the play and then go into 
rehearsal with a certain end in mind, In 
this case we have gone into it with a 

certain process in mind, but not really 
knowing what the end result was going to 
be." 
Hiatus: "Hmmml" 
Wassermann: "I wouldn't even say that 
there would necessarily be one end 
result. What is going to be put in front of 
an audience is a certain point in a 
process I it will be a work in progress." 
Hiatus: "So it might be different every 
night?" 
Wassermann: "It's conceivable, yes. It, .. 
it certainly won't be the same opening 
night as closing night, but whether it's 
going to be noticeably different every 
night, I don't know." 

Wassermann continued to illuminate 
the perspective with which this 
"process" production could be viewed: 
"Under professional circumstances ... 
one would have a preview period, and 
during the preview period one would 
rehearse during the afternoon and then 
perform at night, and rehearse during the 
afternoon and perform at night, for 
anywhere from a couple of days to two 
weeks, then open the show. So I, in my 
point of view, I suppose I think of this as 
a run of previews.. . because it is an 
ongoing process." 
Hiatus: "Process, rather than finished 
product." 
Wasserman: "The emphasis being on 
process rather than on the finished 
product." 
H: "Ah, right; they're both there, but 
this one's more ... " 
W: "Yes. And with a play like this, for 
which there are so many possibilities, 
'finished product' is, I think, . , a rather 
pretentious term."

New Songs for 
Chile and Us 
by ingrid greenberg 

When Sergio Martinez and I called Isabel Aldunate, a 
folk singer from Chile, on a Saturday mo rning, we were 
hoping she would still be at her hotel in Calgary, Canada. 
To our relief she was there, but still asleep, according to a 
friend who answered the phone. Just when we agreed to 
call back, Isabel got on the phone and explained in an 
enthusiastic, yet rough voice that she had stayed up late 
the night before after her concert. We offered to call back 
later to give her time to wake up, but she insisted on 
continuing with the interview. 

For Isabel to be sleeping in is understandable - she's 
been touring the East Coast and Canada since she ~eft 
Chile in early October. This is her second international 
tour in two years and her debut on the West Coast, She 
will perform tomorrow at 7:30 pm in Peterson Hall 110 
on the UCSD campus. 

(Admission is $7 and tickets are on sale at the UCSD 
Box Office. A reception follows.) 

As with most folk singers, Isabel, 35, identifies with 
oppressed people,of which there are many in Chile. Her 
stirring modern folk ballads, many of them flamenco-
flavored, reflect the turbulent history of Chile following 
the overthrow and assasination of the popularly-elected 
president, Salvador Allende, in 1973. Since then, the 
country has experienced increasing oppression under the 
rule of a military junta led by general Augusto Pinochet, 
Hiatus: What is the message you wish to bring to your 
North American audience? 
Aldunate: The message I want to bring is not just mine. My 
repertoire is made up of the creativity of an entire 
generation of new artists and poets and Chilean authors. 
These creators , through their art, are trying to display the 
reality we (Chileans) have been living through the years. 
Not just tne reality of Chile, but the reality of the entire 
continent - a reality that is made up of many sentiments, 
not just a tragedy, To a great extent, we have a tremendous 
vitality, a characteristic that defines Latin America,

2 Hiatw November 7, 1985 

A gala day's enough 
by eric o'tuxed 
The event: The San Diego Symphony Orchestra's Inaugural Concert Gala. 
The place: The former Fox Theater, now renamed Symphony Hall. 
The date: Saturday. November 2. 
The COlt: Ticket prices ranged from $1000 to the bargain basement price of $250. 
The Itan: Oscar Peterson, J ames Galway, David Atherton and the SO Symphony, and 
Toni Tennille, Ben Vereen. Diahann Carroll and Joel G[ey. And dinner! 
The purpose: With ticket prices like these, need you ask? (the symphony raised more 
than $700,000 with this gala program.) 
The report: Seldom have so many paid so much for so little. Or. in the words of my 
teenaged cousin (whose symphony-supporter parents conned us into attending this 
event in their place): "Well, gala me with a symphony." 

Admittedly, that might sound like a pretty trite way to begin a review of what was 
billed by some as "the San Diego artistic event of the century." (Oh, yeah? Try "of the 
weekend" - after all, there were a lot of other Halloween parties taking place that same 
evening.) But, hey. This was a pretty trite affair, even by America's Finest City'S usual 
provincial standards. I mean, Toni Tennille1! Ben Vereen?!! Joel Grey?!!! We're talking 
heavy-duty symphonic talent here. Like, forget Bernard Rands and Isaac Stern, when 
you can get high caliber artists like this. But why no Captain? 
The question: Was this embarrassingly hokey presentation specifically designed to 
further San diego's reputation as a metropolis for motorcycle farmers and assorted 
other yokels? Or was the fact that this sub-Vegas floor-show would have been better 
suited for the opening ceremonies of the Cedar Rapids Convention Center or the Butte 
Bingo Emporium merely par for the course in a city that recently changed the name of 
Albert Einstein Junior High School to Ray Kroc Junior High School? 
The aruwer: All indications appear confirm the questions posed above, but that 
shouldn't come as a big surprise in a city where most people define good art as the 
announcer for radio station KlFM's "lites Out Jazz" program. And like, how 
appropriate, when you consider that this gala event could easily have been retitled 
"Lites Out Culture." 
The real pUrpoIIe: To allow various bank presidents ro mull around looking tres 
important, while their wives displayed their new designer evening gowns. ArtlCulture? 
Music? Please. Let's not quibble over minor technicalities . This was an EVENT. After 
all, it was broadcast in its tedious entirety by Channel 10, which actually pre-empted 
The Love Boat to air this gala spectacular. Way to go, guys! Talk abouttakinga risk. 
The show: Inexplicably, both James Galway and Oscar Peterson were each allowed to 
perform for nearly 15 minutes; a big blunder, since the elimination of these unwanted 
intrusions would have provided even more time for Toni, Ben, Diahann and Joel to 
strut their stuff. And Toni! Now there's a fine-looking woman. Sure, her voice sounds 
like Edith Bunker's with a sore throat, but she certainly has nice teeth. I mean, she was 
just fabulous. And Ben!! What genius to sing not only "Moondance," but a medley 
from Jesus Chnst Superstar, too! Hey, this is real roots music, know what I mean? And 
Diahann!!! She looked even more fabulous than Toni. (By the way, Toni, where was the 
Captain!) And Joe!!!!! What class. what talent. what a guy. Not only did Joel Sing a 
medley of songs from Cabaret (sure, they were mostly Liza Minelli 's songs, but so 
what?), he also did "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy" while waving an American flag. Right 
on. Joe!! Like. "Born in the USA." We were born to boogie.

A review bonanza 

A kiss for you 
by gita reddy 

A movie about vastly 
different people stuck 
together involuntarily is not a 
new idea. Kiss of the Spider 
Woman, adapted faithfully 
from the 1976 novel of the 
same name by Manuel Puig, 
begins as the simple story of 
incompatible cellmates, but 

When he relates these stories 
in vivid detail to Valentin 
Arregui (Raul Julia), the 
revolutionary only pays 
attention enough to chastise 
Molina for what Arregui has 
realized are Nazi propaganda 
films. 

Director Hector Babenco 

Raul Julia and William Hurt: On the outside looking in 

develops into an exploration 
of human nature, the Human 
Condition, and a growing 
friendship between two men 
who see life in two radically 
different ways. 

Luis Molina (William 
Hurt) is an effeminate 
homosexual whose gentle 
nature dictates him to escape 
from the harshness of the 
world that won't accept him 
into the fancifully romantic 
plots of old "B" movies. 

effectively concentrates on 
the friendship that arises out 
of the conflict between the 
two. Both are outsiders. he 
seems to point out, rejected 
through imprisonment by the 
(unnamed) South American 
society in which they live. The 
jail set is more sound stage-
like than it is realistic, but this 
serves only in keeping the 
focus on the story, much as 
Molina's treasured "B"

Successful transformation 

of the common place and 
mundane beyond the 
ordinary · and expected is the 
special pr.ovince of the artist. 
A simpler society than ours 
would call the art of Minori 
Yata Myers magic. This past 
JanuaTY the artist took us to 
Autumn in Kyoto, transporting 
visitors at the Mandeville 
Annex Gallery to the edge of 
the stream in front of the 
famous temple in Japan. This 
week Minori works her magic 
with the transformation of the 
Annex into a show she calls 
My Personal Landscapes. 

N'linori explains, "In the 
triptych, I present my 
separation from the past." M, 
Creek uses lerters from friends 
and family accumulated over 
the past 22 years to create the

With these few' works, 
director Wassermann clued 
Hiatus readers in on one of the 
most difficult and grueling 
realities of theatrical work, 
namely the long hours spent 
working over each small part 
of a show until every action, 
every word, every beat is 
right. Only then can a show 
begin to rise as an organic, 
resonant whole. 

Hearing Wassermann 
speak strengthened the desire 
to witness the results of this 
process, to participate in the 
process itself by joining the 
audience at the Warren 
Theatre. It was evident from 
the concern in his voice that 
he, the cast and the crew have

.. Hiatw November 7, 1985 

UCSD's 
Twelfth 
Night 
Continued from page 3 
put a great deal of labor into 
their presentation of 
Shakespeare's comedy. 

The play is a rollicking live 
comedy. the likes of which 
were so popular in Shake, 
speare's day. Orsino loves 
Olivia who falls for Viola 
who's disguised as a man and 
who would feign love ... In 
counterpoint to the witty and 
bitter phrasing of thelove-
chase are the raucous doings 
of two Falstaff,types, Sirs 
Aguecheek and Belch, and 
their cohort Maria, as they 
seek to bring down the 
puritanical and self,impressed 
Malvolio, by tricking him 
into ... The carousing of the 
two foolish knights reminds 
one of what must have been 
the UCSD administration's 
worst nightmares about 
student life before the alcohol 
policy. 

A reading of the text can 
only give one the bare bones 
of the story, however, and 
produces an appetite to 
experience the performance, 
alive and breathing, with all 
the wildness and subtlety that 
live theatre can deliver to 
Shakespeare. 

Futhermore, there is a 
certain curiousity aroused by 
the emphasis being placed on 
the "process" of perfor, 
mance/ staging, rather than 
the more traditional 
"product" emphasis. This 
presentation of Twelfth Night 
is the first of the "verse 
projects" to be produced by 
the drama department, above 
and beyond the regular 
prod uction line,up. The 
projects are examples of the 
department's continuing 
determination to cut new 
ground in education, 
performance and production. 
Moliere's Don Juan will be 
staged in February; Chek, 
hov's The Three Sisters will be 
"explored" in May. 

When Wassermann was 
asked whether there were any 
aspects of the play that he, as 
directo rr , was particularly 
trying to bring out, he 
responded, " Well. .. there 
are some things, but I'd rather 
like them to appear in the 
production." 

Hiatus looks forward to the 
attempt to discover what 
those things are. Then, of 
course, there is always the 
more popular level of viewing 
theatre and comedy as a good 
time to be had by all. Readers 
are reminded that the Warren 
Theatre is located on the little 
street behind the University 
Bookstore (see map). Tickets 
are available in advance at 
UCSD's Mandell Weiss 
Center, the Student Center 
Box Office, all TicketMaster 
outlets and on the nights of 
the performance one hour 
prior to curtain (at the 
Warren Theatre Box Office). 

Barring unforseen de ' 
velopments, a review of the 
presentation will appear in 
next week's (Nov. 14) Hiatw.

Continued from page 1 
H: Apparently, your music is distributed 
differently in Chile. Give us background 
information on La Pena (coffeehouses or gathering 
places). 
A: The story begins in the 1950s. There was a great 
figure with whom you may be familiar, Violeta 
Parra. She began to study folkloric music. After 
Violeta, there was a whole group of people like 
Victor lara, Patricio Manns, Violeta's children, 
who began to diffuse our cultural heritage that up 
until that moment had been completely ignored by 
our official culture. Around the 19605, the Penas 
began to ' appear and fundamentally they were 
organized by Violeta's children. And this new 
movement was called the "new Chilean song" and 
it had its culmination in the three years of the 
popular union (Allende); after that period in 1973 
there was violent upheaval that put an end to all 
these projects of really popular culture. After 
1973, all the cultural manifestations began to 
organize in an underground manner . In 1975 and 
'76 La Pena began to flower again in a very artisan, 
warm, c1ose,knit environment in Santiago (as) a 
kind of alternative channel to the official channels 
(TV and r.adio) that up until that moment were 
controlled. Along with the Penas, we began to sing 
to the population base in the children's soup 
kitchens and aid organizations for unemployed. 
H: You spoke of difficulties which are placed in 

your way. 
A: The barriers they put in our way are very diverse 
and they go from the most crude to the more 
sophisticated. The economic barrier, for example: 
All the people who are creating culture in Chile are 
also starving to death. For another thing, the mass 
media does not permit us to ~nter because our 
artisitic and poetic elaboration doesn't fall within 
the range of the commercial format. (And) there's 
the factor of the large censorship which has had its 
different forms throughout the years. In 1977 and 
'78 the language we had to use in our songs was 
very metaphorical. Through poetic imagery we 
tried to say those things which we could not say 
openly. The language we now use is much more 
direct and much more simple and (has) much more 
force than what we were using in '77 and '78. 
Censorship has undergone a metamorphosis; 
nevertheless, they continue not to allow us 
expression in the official vacuous media. 
H: You are a mother of three children, a lawyer and 
a successful singer. What can you share with 
women of this country? 
A: I've always been a very privileged woman and 
I've had the opportunity to succeed in my projects. 
I feel I am a product of a tremendous force . Ifeel 
nothing is gained without a cost. Sacrifices and 
costs are very painful. For example, the possibility 
of large distribution (of my music) in my country is 
slim, but it is a road that I follow freely and happily. 
In doing what I wish I achieve a certain gratification 
which is one of the most important things in life. 
As a woman and mother, I have asked myself many 
times: Am [ doing my job as a mother? Am 1 
making a mistake? I have come to the conclusion:

no. A project that allows me, a woman, to develop 
my individual project, allows me to socialize and to 
be an active member of society. This life I lead 
permits me to demonstrate to my children a role 
model that definitely makes me happy. That role 
model is the greatest thing 1 can offer my children. 
H: \X'hile on tour do you get a chance to speak with 
your children often? 
A: Well, no. I haven't had a chance to speak with 
them often because of the economic factor 
involved. It always weighs on our heads like a 
stone. I've spoken to them a few times and I always 
get a mixture of things. I get a great joy in 
anticipation of seeing them, but then I feel sad at 
being so far away from them. 
H: You studied dance as a child? 
A: 1 had a strange life as a kid. I jumped from one 
project to another in a seemingly random way. My 
first goal was to be a ballerina. For 10 years I 
worked hard at that. After school I went to ballet 
school for three to four years. This project was 
brought to an end in a rather tragic way due to a 
back injury. At the age of 16 I stopped dancing. 
Then I got my law certificate specifically on the 
subject of human rights. It was a project that was 
costly for me and I finished it in 1982. It's a project 
that continues to be viable for me even if in a less 
direct way. After I finished that career, I began my 
project as a mother. I decided to set the rest of my 
activities aside in order to raise my children. For 
four or five years I was absolutely dedicated to 
being a mother. Afterwards, through a family 
connection, I began once again to blossom to the 
wor Id . In 1977 on December 24 I ded icated myself 
to singing.

movies did decades earlier . 

Although set in the present, 
Kiss of the Spider Woman has 
an almost pseudo-realistic 
feeling, similar to older 
movies and also the quality 
Woody Allen evoked in 
Purple Rose of Cairo. 

The blacked-tressed 
Brazilian beauty Sonia Braga 
melodramatically plays the 
heroines of Molina's movies 
in the "real" film's two 
movie-within-a-movie, black 
and white sequences. She also 
plays (stone-faced this time) 
Marta, Arregui's bourgeosie 
lover, in a flashback. 

Raul Julia is solemn but 
moving as Valentin Arregui, 
the tortured political prisoner 
who feels guilty for failing as a 
revolutionary. 

William Hurt, however, 
stands out among the 
excellence in Spider Woman . 
His performance (which won 
him Best Actor at this year's 
Cannes Film Festival) is 
neither caricatured nor 
condescending, as so many 
homosexuals are portrayed in 
the mass movies. Luis Molina 
is simply another human 
being who, try as he does, has 
yet to succeed in life. 

Kiss of the Spider Woman is 
overall a rare cinematic 
achievement: a political film 
that movingly dramatizes the 
human willingness to 
sacrifice, without preaching 
morals and religion or 
acknowledging its own 
ingenuity. 

Currently screening at the 
Guild in Hillcrest, Kiss of the 
Spider Woman will remain in 
town until next Thursday.

smell of the campfire and the 
promise of a new day given by 
a sun setting among mountain 
peaks is security and comfort 
that speaks without artifice. In 
our complex society this is 
true magic, this is true art. 
Strong and powerful 
statements such as these 
speaking directly without the 
mediation of words, across 
cultural boundaries, over 
sexist barriers, echoing 
through ancient feelings 
threatened by our modern 
civilization, and appealing to 
common visual aesthetics is a 
hopeful turn from our recent 
history of moderist art. You

bv robin scott 

Once again, your friendly 
Hiatus, the magazine 
dedicated to constantly 
probing the cultural niches of 
the universe, has procured yet 
another hot tip. If you are a 
"new music" aficionado who 
is no stranger to northbound 
pilgrimages, then please take 
note. 

This Friday, AI's Bar in 
downtown L.A. will host a 
late night screening of rare, 
early vintage "punk" and 
"new wave" video footage. 
The program has been 
compiled by Target Video, a 
San Francisco-based group 
founded in 1977 by video 
artist Joe Rees, which has 
documented more than 350 
groups and events from which 
Rees has compiled this special 
program. 

The screening will focus on 
the roots of new music as it 
existed while still an 
underground will focus on the 
roots of nw music, as it existed 
while still an underground art 
form. The groups featured are 
the Avengers, The Bags, 
Castration Squad, Cramps, 
Dead Kennedys, Devo, Dils, 
No Mercy, Non, Pink Section, 

Pil, Ramones, Residents, Sex 
Pistols, Patti Smith, Talking 
Heads, Teenage Jesus and the 
Jerks, Weirdos and X. 

This screening is part of a 
larger exhibition curated by 
the VideoLace Committee 
entitled "New Music America 
Video Program," which is 
currently on display at Los 
Angeles Contemporary 
Exhibitions (LACE) through 
November 10. The exhibition 
is broken down into four 
categories: • 'Historical 
Documentation," which 
features some unusual and 
often humorous footage of 
early uses of image with 
music; "The Video Acid Test: 
A Retrospective, It which 
examines rock music video 
development between the 
years 1964 and 1969; "When 
New Wave Was New, " from 
which the Target Video piece 
is taken; and "Collabora-
tion," which concentrates on 
works created dependently by 
composer and musician. 

Although the big event 
happens tomorrow at AI's 
Bar, the entire exhibition is 
truly a gem and well worth the 
trek . For more information, 
call (213)620-0104.
