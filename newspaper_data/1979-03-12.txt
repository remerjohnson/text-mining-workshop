On Campus 
Housing 
Increase 
Stymied 

By Wayne Hunt 
Staff Writer 

The recent referendum to 
increase the activity fee for 
students living on campus was 
declared invalid due to an 
insufficient voter turnout. 

Student apathy and poor 
weather killed the initiative, 
said Pat Danylyshyn-Adams, 
election coordinator and Muir 
resident counselor. 

The referendum asked 
resident students if they would 
raise the dorm activity fee from 
$6 to $10 in order to fund more 
activities.

Coal ilion Ca"rries 
Through With 
Vending Boycott 
College Representatives Request 
Continued Support in Getting 
Vending Machine Profits Returned 

By Steve Schneider 
Staff Writer 

Jon Osborne, a spokesman 
for the Progressive Coalition, 
said Friday at a rally marking 
the end of "Vending Machine 
Awareness Week" that the 
coalition sponsored vending 
machine boycott held last week 
was " more successful than we 
(the coalition) thought it would 
be." . 

With the cooperation of the 
Food Co.oP, the Coalition called 

the boycott as a·· result of the 
postponement of the AS 
sponsored boycott scheduled 
for last week . While the 
Coalition posted boycott notices 
on vending machines and set 
out to persuade students to 
avoid the machines, the Food 
Coop provided an alternative 
source of food both at their 
store in the Student Center and 
at tables around campus. The guidelines for a 

minimum turnout set by 
Richard Armitage, Vice 
Chancellor of Student AfUiirs, 
required a 25 percent ~oter 
turnout (583 students) to make 
the initiative valid. 

A total of 396 (16.9%) students 
from the four colleges voted. 
The oCCicial results showed 220 
students casting their ballots 
for and 176 again t the proposed 
fee increase. 

'Infiltrating' Council 
According to Scott Kessler of 

the Food Coop, sales increased 
last week from an average of 
$280 per day to over $400 per 
day . Most of the increased 
business, Kessler said, was at 

. the Coop store, and not at the 
tables, which were set up 
specifically for the boycott. The 
tables were discontinued after 
the first two days of the boycott 
due to low sales. 

Gary Jacobs , student 
election coordinator for 
Revelle, bl amed tudent 
apat hy for the election's 
failure, aying "when I asked 
tudents to vote the general 

reaction was totally apathetic 
and at times even ho tile." 

According to Jacobs, the 
intermittent rain and the fact 
that the Daycare referendum 
was conducted on the same day 
a t different lo cations on 
campu caused much of the low 
turnout. 

Warren College coordinator 
Jamie Gates, who was behind 
the 50 percent voter turnout at 
Warren, was dis appointed, but 
claimed that ."we voice our 
opinion and we will take the 
initiative if it is given to us." 

Gates added that it is 
becoming increasingly difficult 
to get money allocated. "The 
administration pretty. much 
runs the show." 

Internship Brings St~dents, SO Council Together 
By Steve Morus 

Senior S&aff Writer 
" Infiltrating" the San Diego 

City Council is the motivation 
behind a new City Council 
internship Cor students, Jim 
Lofgren, AS External Affairs 
Commissioner says. 

The idea came from last 
month's council meeting on 
transit cuts and increasing 
police strength. 

According to Lofgren, AS 
members and intere ted 
students who accompanied him 
to the council meeting last 
month "could tell by the way 
the meeting was going that the 
councilmen had already made 
up their minds and were just 
going through the motions." 
The clincher, Lofgren aid, was 
a note he saw on Councilman 
BilT Mitchell's desk stating by 
exactly what margin the Police 
proposal would pass, before the 
vote was called. 

Lofgren decided then, he 
said, "that we would have to get 
to them (the Council) before' 

their meetings," before they 
could make·up thetr minds: 

The plan, Lofgren explained, 
is to place student interns into 
the offices of councilmen -
students who can open up 
communications channels by 
presenting student views to the 
councilmen and reporting back 
the councilmen's views to the 
AS. 

So far , the plan has received 
an enthusiastic welcome from 
both councilmen and students. 
According to . Lofgren. six 
council members have agreed 
to accept interns either next 
quarter or during the summer. 
As for students, seven have 
already answered the ad theAS 
placed in The .Guardian 
announcing the program. 

If the internship program is 
successful. Lofgren plans to 
extend it next year, in cope 
and budget. He sees the 
possibility of placing interns 
into other important govern-
ment offices that deal with 
student issues. 

This can be accomplished, 
L(JfgTen said , either by 
expanding the Warren College 
internship program , which 
currently deals mostly in 
communications and com-
munity work experience, or by 
creating a centralized service 
which Lofgren dubs CASINO 
(College and Associated 
Students Internship Office) . 

To decide between the two ' 
alternatives Lofgren plans to 
" explore the scope and 
efficiency of exi ting pro-
grams," improving them if 
they are effective by working 
with them in clo e conjunction 
or centralizing if they are not. 

Lofgren believes that 
reaching students who might be 
interested in internships i 
extremely important, some-
thing that can be greatly 
improved by cooperation or 
con olidation. 

Student who become 
interns, Lofgren pointed out, 
can receive University credit at

Although Jon Bekken of the 
Progressive Coalition said the 
boycott is "not technically till 
going on ," he encouraged 
tudents to avoid u ing the 

machine . Bekken added that 
the Coalition will support the 
AS boycott, currently re-
scheduled for the econd week 
of next quarter.

Iranian ·Students are. in Two Struggles 
Concerned Because of Studies, 
Turmoil in Home Country 

By John Klock 
Staff Writer 

A UCSD freshman . thou-' 
ands of mile from home, gets 

a call from home every week. 
This is the fir t of three arUcies 
regarding UCSD students from 
Iran. 
Nothing too unusual .there, 
xcept that this call is not to 

make ure the freshman is 
all right, it i to reassure him 
that his family , living in 
turbulent Iran. ha not been

Th freshman, Abdi Hariri. is 

typical of Iranian students, the 
largest eroup of foreign 
students in the US. As political 
stability in their home country 
deteriorated over the last year, 
o has their position here. 
Worries about loved ones are 

not unfounded. One Iranian 
woman told abou~ a friend from 
high chool who died in the 
revolution with a stick of 
dynamite in her hand. 

La t week 26 Iranian students 
met In the third meeting of the 
Iranian Mo I m Students' 
A ociation. They talked about 

what it has been like to live here 
with everything that is 
happening there. 

"I go to the library to study, 
but I end up going straight to 
the newspaper. to see what i 
happening in Iran," one of them 
said, and other nodded 
agreement. 

The newe t problem is 
money . Last fa ll the banks were 
closed in their home country, 
and the fund for their 
education often imply could 
not be sent. When the Aya tollah 
Khomeini took over the 
country' reins, he froze the 
government cholarship funds 
that were upporting 4,000 
eraduate stud nt in th US.

~ Who Gets Slices of 
Mexico's Petro-pie? 

Oil Revenue Struggle Continues Rich-Poor Split; 
Predicted Bonanza for Underclass Looks Unlikely 

By S&even Sanderson 
Pacific Newt Service 

W ill petro pesos be Mexico's salvation, or strain a society already facing. major social problems to the breakinl 
point? For President Jose Lopez 

Portillo, the key problem is not how to use the 
new oil bonanza to turn Mexico into a major 
international power, but how to use it to solve 
the internal problems threatening the stability 
of his government and the whole of Mexican 
society. 

Wealth, in Mexico, is nothing new. Since 
World War II, Mexico has been considered the 
" economic miracle" of Latin America. 
Between HNO and 1970, growth in GNP 
exceeded five percent annually, and industrial 
production and employment overtook 
traditional agrarian production as the 
mainstay of the economy . Steel , 
petrochemical and pharmaceutical industries 
marked Mexico as a leader of the "less-
4eveloped world ... 
Sleven Suder.on, • former Fullbrlgbl 

sebolar in Mexico, &eaches poIUlcai seience at 
, S&aaford Ulliverslty. He i. &lie author 01 a 
fortllcomin, book 011 Mexico's a,rarlan 
reform movement. 

Yet Mexico's economic miracle always has 
had an underside. Today, after 30 years of 
growth, the richest 20 percent of the Mexican 
population receive 64 percent of the GNP, 
while the poorest 40 percent get only 10 percent 
of the wealth. Unemployment and 
underemployment run officially at about 50 
percent, affecting more than II million people. 
Population growth, at 3.2 percent (4.0 percent 
in the countryside) threatens to double the 
number of people in Mexico by the year 2000. 
Mexico City, already choked by a population in 
excess of 12 million, may see a population of 32 
million by the end of the century. 

I n this troubled setting, Mexican oil and gas finds have been greeted as "Mexico's salvation," a financial 
bonanza that might resolve the 

economic and social distortions of the past 
three decades. But the "bonanza" theory 
assumes there are effective channels in 
Mexico for redistributing oil revenues to 
benefit the poor. 

The truth is that the Mexican government 
seems even less well equipped today to solve 
social problems with its oil wealth than it has 
been to use Mexico's industrial growth to help 

the average citizen sinCe the end of World War 
II. 

The reason lies in the political changes that 
have occurred in Mexico since Lopez Portillo 
succeeded his left-leaning pre.aecessor, Luis 
Echeverria Alvarez, as president in 1976. 

By the time he left office, Echeverria, who 
had carried out an aggressive - if 0 nly 
partially successful - land distribution 
program, bad alienated most of the nation's 
conservative businessmen and entrepreneurs. 
In the final months of his term, Echeverria was 
locked in a struggle with Mexican and U.S. 
investors that resulted in a $4 billion capital 
flight from the economy, two peso 
devaluations (the first in 22 years), and an 
almost unanimous vote of "00 confidence" by 
the private sector. With a crushing foreign 
debt, domestic social conflict at a high point, 
and no clear alternative to the left, Lopez 
Portillo sought to cultivate the political right 
when he took office. 

In the first two years of Lopez Portillo's 
rei,n, the same forces who opposed 
Echeverria diMated the terms under whicb 
they would cooperate with the new president's 
planned reconstruction of tbe private sector 
and tbe exploitation of oil and gas. For the new 
president's "Alliance for Production" to 
succeed, the Enterprise Coordinating Council' 
(CCE) demanded a program of fiscal 
austerity, increased business incentives, 
reduced state participation in industry, and 
abandonment of many a,cial programs, 
including agrarian reform. 

Lopez Portillo, predisposed to similar 
policies, complied. 

T he problem with these policies is .that tbey bave moved Mexico no nearer to solutions for the nation's most 
pressing social' problems. The 

excessive cost of exploring for oil ($16 billion 
through 1982) has, in fact, diverted national 
resources away from the poor. 

By concentrating government spending on 
oil extraction and industrialization, Lopez 
Portillo has placated foreign investors and 
powerful national industrialists and 
financiers . But he is able to give only lip 
service to the nation's gigantic distribution 
and unemployment problems. While the 
government acknowledges an unemployment 
figure of only 9-11 million people, it also admits 
that only about 9 million of 31 million Mexicans 
of working age are gainfully employed.

Headline Confuses 
UFW Strike Issue 
Editor: 

In an article (7 March 19'19) 
on the United Farm Workers 
(UFW) strike, Tbe G ....... 
headline "Chave,: UFW 
Sta)'ioc Out, Price Ioere .. 
Shown" resurrectS a time-worn 
anti-union slander: it is the 
strikers who are responsible for 
the dislocations accompanying 
a strike. Nothing is said of the 
growers wbo are spending 
thousands every week to pay 
for a massive public relations 
blitz and for the "security 
guards" (i.e. gun thugs) who 
were 'responsible for the brutal 
murder of a UFW picket last 
month. This strike would be 
over in an Insta nt - : all the 
growers have to do is sign the 
UFW contract. But to pay the 
farm workers a living wage 
would cut into the profits of 
Imperial Valley agri-
businessmen, so they call on 
their faithful servants - tbe 
scabs, the cops, the courts and 
Carter's "anti-inflation" wage 
limits - to break the strike. 

It bas not been Chavez'S 
impotent boycotts ().r his 

reliance OIl the Democratic 
Party which built the UFW, or 
maintained this strike. Tbe 
effectiveness of the strike so far 
has been largely due to the 
heroic determination of tbe 
strikers to maintalD their 
picket lines in the lace 0( 
violence by the sheriffs, COp8 
and the growers' thugs. Tbjs 
strike will be won throup labor 
solidarity, by extending it to the 
Important San Joaquin and 
Salinas fields, and by calliq on 
the Teamsters not to handle 
struck produce. Such a strategy 
would quickly brinl tbe 
growers to their knees and end 
the strike - with a viclOry for 
tbe UFW.

'Sweet Eros' Production 
Perpetuates Rape Myth 
To: D:-. Michael Addison 

Tbe UCSD Women's Center 
wishes to bring to your 
attention our reaction to the 
Drama Department's recent 
production of Sweet Eros. We 
are outraged that the 
performance perpetuated the 
myth that a woman is a willing 
participant in her own rape. 
The director a nd the Drama 
Department were irresponsible 
in choosing to interpret the play 
as a glorification of rape. 

In the performance, the 
completely unexplained 
change in the victim's attitude 
towards ' her rapist, when 
combined with the .. romantic 
music ~rnost notably, the 
Beatles' "It's Only Getting ' 
Better"), implied that she had 
(allen in love with her attacker. 

We are concerned that th-e, 
powerful medium of theatre. 
especially University-run 
theatre, ought not be used to 
condone acts of violence 
against - women . The Drama 
Department has a responsi-
bility to the women and men on 
campus to be aware of the 
Implications of it. produ lions 
and not to proceed blindly In the 

name of art . 
Sincerely yours, 

The Women's Center

establishment of the Energy 
Conservation Committee in 
June of that year. However, the 
trend seems to have reversed. 

According to Don Sites , 
Associate Vice Chancellor of 
Facilities Management and 
chairman of the ll-member 
committee, the reduction of 
energy use was measured per 
square foot of developed space. 
Thus, as Sites explained, 
although the total amount of 
energy used on university 
property has increased in the 
past six years because of the 
construction of new facilities,

Since Its formation, the 

Energy Conservation Com-
mittee has been monitoriDi the 
campus-wide power meter 
systems to determine energy 
usale rat!!'. Electricity use, in 
particular, is a target for 
reduction, said Sites. "since 
electricity is such a large part 
of the total budget (of the 
university) . " 

According to Landa, one of 
the major drains on electricity 
is the operation of ventilation 
and temperature control units 
in university buildings. " We're 
trying to see if, by turning down 
the heat and reducing 
ventilation during the 'off 
hours,' we can sort of pick up 
energy there," he said. 

On the individual level , 
Landa encouraged such action 
as the decrease in the use of 
heaters, avoidance of unneces-
sary use of the electric doors 
installed for the benefit oC the 
disabled, and are-initiation oC 
the recycling efforts. 

Said Landa, " I think the best 
thing the individuals can do as a 
whole is to make the 
administration jJware that they 
would support any con-
servation efforts an(J sort of put 
some motivation bebind the 
people in the administration. " 

Both Sites and Landa agree 
that the Energy Conservation 
Committee has essentially. ' 
become a permanent member 
of the university's long list of 
advisorlal bodies. Landa 
describes it a s " a watchdog-
type of organization" serving to 
prevent· further increases in 
energy use, further "slacking 
off" of conservation efforts. 

The m e m b e r sol the' 
committee are interested in 
recommendations from the 
campus population as to how 
energy waste can be reduced, 
according to Landa, since 
even a buildiDI-by-building 
monitoring of usage is 
extremely difficult at a 
university ol this size .

"I will be all right, " one said. 
" We are required to take 12

bitter that no scholarships are 
available, despite his GPA oC

"I took a job as a research

Track Teams Uneven 
All-Cals, by definition, are 

supposed to be sporting events 
where teams representing each 
of the UC campuses get 
together for athletic , compe-
tition and fellowship. The idea 
was there last weekend at the 
Women's Track and Field All-
Cal at UC Berkeley, but the 
teams were not. 

Four schools, UC's Irvine, 
Riverside, Berkeley and San 
Diego, competed in the non-
scori ng competition, with 
Berkeley obviously over-
powering the other three 
squads. Many of UCB's women 
are on track or cross country 
scholarships. 

The San Diego squad did not 
fare badly, however, in their 
second meet of the season. 
Field events once agains were 
the Triton strongpoint, with San 
Diego's women placing se~nd, 
third a nd fourth in the discuss 
and shotput. 

Sherre Lilley lead the way 
with a discus toss of IDS feet, 11 
inches, good enough for second. 
Lydia Zele (87 feet, 4 inches) 
and Renee Scott (83 feet, 2 
inches) added to the Triton 
effort. 

In the shot Mary Egan, also a 
Triton basketball player, 
heaved over 35 feet for a second 
place finish . Lilley and Scott 
placed third and fourth. Lilley 
also placed in the javelin with a 
throw of 100 feet , 7 inches. 

In other field events, the 
team standard was set in the 
I1igh jump by Egan, clearing 
the bar at a height of 4 feet, 10 
inches. 

The men 's track team 
traveled to Thousand Oaks last 
Saturday to compete-in the Cal 
Lutheran-Kingsland Relays 
against seven other NAIA 
Division III schools. 

All the events were open to 
groups only - four peoph~ for

The Triton's best showing of 
the day came in the bigh jump 
where the three man team of

In the mile relay Doug 
Caesar, Karl Jacobs, Serrano,

Men Have Shot 
At Title After 
V-ball Marathon 

By Karen Hunler 
Spons Editor 

Playing their most Important 
game of the season, a 2111 hour 
marathon Saturday Dight In the 
Main Gym, the UCSD Tritons 
overcame Cal Poly Pomona, 3-
2, to move into contention for 
the league title with a 3-2 league 
record. 

The hard hilling Tritons 
came out strong, winning the 
first game, 15-6. Coach Doug 

- Dannevik altered his starting 
line-up , keeping regular 
starters Hal Jacobs and Dave 
Peking on the bench, and 
playing Will Triggs and Eric 
Willis, 

"Hal and Dave (Jacobs and 
Pekin) seem to get really tense 
in the first game so I decided to 
keep them out. It worked really 
well." The two regulars 
entered in mid-game and made 
"very few mistakes ," 
according to the coach. 

Overconfidence stopped the 
UCSD squad in the second 
game, 2-15. A IH7 loss in the 
third game put the Tritons 
down, 2-1 going into the fourth 
game of the match . 

The fourth and crucial game 
was the turning point, with the 
Tritons coming out on the 
winning end, 1&-8. 

"We came back after being 
down two games to one and took 
charge, " said Dannevik. "Our 
guys kept the momentum 
going. " 

Triggs subbed in for John 
Mooney during th& fourth 
game , contributing to the 
Triton effort. 

The Tritons leaped out to a 4-0 
start in the fifth an(J final game, 
not threatened at all by 
Pomona. Ahea.d 14-8 the UCSD 
squad seemed to have the game 
and the match in the bag, until a 
late Pomona rally upped the 
score to 14-11. 

UCSD had four opportunities 
to clinch the game but 
according to Dannevik, "must 
have been trying too hard :-" The 
team finally got it all together, 
blocked a Pomona pass, and 
scored the winning point. 

"This was by Car our best 
game of the season," Dannevik 
remarked. "It was a total team 
effort where we passed and hit 
really well." 

Dannevik used ten players, 
subbing in Crequently to give 
the starters a rest. 

Steve Upp, team captain, 
played his best game of the 
year with a fine display oC 
setting. "As a hitter and 

blocker Steve had the best 
perCormance any of our players 
has had in a match this 
s~ason," praised Dannevik. 

"We've got the momentum 
now to conceivably win all the 
rest of our games," explained 
Dannevik. "We've turned an 
important corner in our 
season." 

The San Diego squad met San 
Diego State in action last 
Wednesday night in the Main 
Gym. 

With the Tritons down 0-8 In 
the first game UCSD 
coach Doug Dannev!k 
called a time out. Whatever he 
told the members of the men's 
volleyball team must have been 
either inspiring or threatening, 
because the Tritons came back 
to tie the nationally ranked 
Aztecs beCore eventually losing 
the first game, 13-15, in front of 
a supportive home crowd. 

Although the Tritons did lose 
the match, 3-0, Dannevik feels 
that his team played "100 
percent better" than the first 
time the two teams met this 
season. 

"We hustled and we were 
scrappy but that's our team 
trademark," the coach 
explained. "We made State 
earn the win." 

The Aztecs used their second 
team in all three games against 
the Tritons, winning the second 
and third by identical 15-7 
scores. 

The Tritons failed several 
times during the match to take 
advantage of the breaks that 
came their way . 
• Freshman Adam Cherry 
came off the bench Cor the first 
lime this season to contribute to 
the Triton effort. "Adam was 
nervous about playing for the 
first time but he did a real good 
job," commended Dannevik. 

John Mooney played his 
usual hustling game for the 
Tritons. 

"I'd have to say that John 
best typifies the whole team," 
Dannevik said. "He hustles, 
he's intense, and gives 100 
percent the whole time." 

Dannevik says that the 
possibility of the young squad 
receiving a national play-off 
berth is good but will depend on 
the team's performances in the 
coming weeks . The team 
currently has a 3-9 overall 
record, compiled against some 
of the toughest teams on the 
west coast.

UCSD swimmers and one diver at the NAIA Nationals in 

Swimmers Take .11th 
Tritons Set New School Records at Nationals 

By Jon Goetz 
Senior Staff Writer 

The men swimmers held on to 
lIth place in the N AlA 
Nationals after two days of the 
three day competition. 

Results for the final day, 
Saturday, were not available 
yesterday. 

snapped his 1978500 free record . 
by nearly two secon~s in 4: 44.6. 
He finished sevel1th' in the 
event, beating out Hernandez 
who took tenth place with a 
4: 45.91 finish. 

Another old record fell 
Thursday, this time to Mark 
Allen in the 200 1M. He finished 
13th in 2: 01.1, besting his 1978 
2: 02 mark. On Friday, Allen 
placed 14th in the 100 back, but 
failed to snap the school record. 

The Tritons finished 
fourteenth in the Nationals in 
1978 with only four swimmers 

at the Portland meet. This 
year, however, seven swim-
mers and a diver flew to 
Alabama for the weekend to 
compete for UCSD. With this 
added depth, they snapped a 
pair of relay recOrds. 

Hernandez , Allen, Halsted, 
and Greg McGary set new 
school marks in the 400 medley 
and 800 free relays . They 
skimmed nearly ten seconds oCf 
the freestyle time of 7: 14.0 with 
their 7: 04.86 swim. The medley 
time fell by over four seconds 
with their 3: 41.35 clocking. 

Five UCSD records fell on 
Thursday and Friday at the 
Huntsville, Alaba'ma AII-
American meet. Joe Her-
nandez, Lance Halsted, and 
Mark Allen each broke their 
own school marks, and teamed 
with Greg McGary to set two 
new relay records. 

Hernandez took third in the 
200 free Friday with a 1:43.06 
clocking, but failed to win the 
event as coach Bill Morgan had 
suggested he might. He still 
beat his old sc~ool record of 
1: 44.5, set two weeks earlier 
against Fresno Pacific . 
Halsted also placed in the race, 
swimming away with a 1: 44.6 in 
18th.

Point Loma, who deCeated 

UCSD last year, was expected 
to challenge Cor the NAJA 
District III championship along 
with the powerful USIU team. 

But that was not to be, as 
UCSD easily disposed oC the 
visiting Point Lorna goif~rs . 

Jim Miller led the crunch 
with a sizzling 73. Steve Kadota, 
with a 78, and Tim Sullivan and 
Dave Warnick with a pair of 
79s, rounded out the strong 
team performance. 

The team oC Miller and 
Sullivan howed no mercy in 
stroking to a lopsided 16-2 
victory over their rival Point 
Lorna opponents. 

"We had a strong victory, it 
was definitely our best match of 
the year," said Coach Owens . . 

Today UCSD will face the 
visiting team of "'Oashington 
University from Washington, 
D.C., and then go on to face 
Whitman UniverSIty out of 
Washington next Friday 
afternoon. 

Tuning up Cor the district 
championships, UCSD will play

the last two days of nnals week, 
and then compete in the 
important All-Cal Tourney the 
following Monday and Tues-
day. 

It will then be off to Mexico 
on April 28 to play in a

S n Diego Symphony Joins Majors ------
By Han."rin .. 

"The San Die,o Symphony 
Orchestra i bavin, an 
excellent season and next year 
should be even ,reater! .. That 
is bow Joe Kobryner, Business 
Manager for the SOSO 
anSwered when I asked him hla 
opinion on this year's concert 
season. Judgh" from the first 
five of sixteen scheduled 
protJrams, I must agree with 
Kobryner. The orchestra is 
visibly gaining the enthusiastic 
support of a growinl le,ion of 
music lovers. Next year, the 
orchestra's budget and number 
of performances will enable it 
to become one of the tbirtyorso . 
major orches!ras' in the nation. 

Kobryner went on to explain 
why. 

"Mr. Peter Eros. Music 
Director for the past seven 
years, has been a great 
motivational rorce in raising 
the status of the SDSO." 
Indeed, Eros has more than 
twenty-five years or conductin, 
experience behind him and haa 
worked with slK!h renowned 
conductors as OUo Klemperer. 

"About three years ago, the 
orchestra shifted from 
nighttime rehearsals to 
daytime ones. Before that, 
many of the musicians had 
considered their work with the 
orchestra as part time. Many 
musicians worked or went to 

school during the day and by 
the time,they got to rehearsal, 
were too tired to put everything 
into the music .. , 

"Another reason for the 
orchestra's improvement is 
that it is now doing more public 
performances than ever 
before. That is, sixteen weeks 
or concerts usually performed 
three times per week." 

While Kobryner's observa-
tions help explain the more 
subtle, behind-the-scenes 
reasons for the success of the 
SDSO, I would add that the 
music this season has generally 
been ramiliar and within the 
standard repertory. After all, I 
like to listen to music that I am

familiar with so that I can tell 
whether or not it is being played 
with competence. 

So rar, this season has 
featured works by Beethoven, 
Brahms and Chopin. This 
season has been dedicated to 
the 150th anniversary of the 
death of Schubert, whose music 
will be preformed throughout 
the season. Nevertheless, Eros 
has varied his programs with 
less known a.nd contemporary 
pieces by composers such as 
Berlioz, Bartok and Merrill 
Bradshaw, who is presently 
Composer-in-residence at 
Brigham Young University. 

The most i mpressi ve 
highlights of the first five 

invites you for 

programs were Beethoven'S 
Symphony No.7, Schumann's 
Symphony No. 3and, best of all, 
the mighty Brahms Symphony 
No .... All ofthese performances 
brought the appreciative 
audience to its feet. 

Some upcoming programs 
that I especially look forward to 
will include Prokofiev's 
Symphony No.5, Ravel's 
Daphnia and Chloe S.lite No. ! 
and Tchaikovsky's Violin 
Conceno. which is perhaps the 
greatest and most colorful ever

Death by Boredom Lurks in 
Carter's 'Delicate Balance' 

By Jill Louise Bazeley 
CoDlributhll ' Editor 

There are plays and there are 
plays . Some seem short and are 
actually long, Others drag on 
interminably, but last only two 

hours. The production of A 
Delicate Balance at the Carter 
Centre Stage is one of the latter 
type. 

I was astonished to find the 
clock in my car registering only 

'A Delicate Balance' Is currently showlnl at the Cark'r Cenlre 
Siage, 

10 : 30 after the dreary 
performance. But death by 
boredom is a slow and painful 
process, and A Delicate 
Balance is just that - slow and 
painful. . 

The play is about six people 
poised on the scales of life, 
trying to maintain the balance 
between emotional crisis on the 
one hand, and emotional 
collapse on the other. Agnes 
and Tobias are an older 
married oouple whose 
marriage is in a state of chaos. 
They are visited, all at once, by 
an alcoholic sister, Claire, a 
divorce-prone, hysterical 
daughter, Julia, and their best 
rriends, a dumpy couple who 
are terribly a fraid of sdmethi ng 
which they themselves cannot 
even recognize. 

The feather which will most 
Iiltely destroy everyone's 
equilibrium is the attempt to 
recoil from the horror of age 
and the eventuality of death . All 
the characters are getting old 
- too old. Claire, who claims 
she is not an alcoholic, just a 
drunk, prompts her sister 
Agnes to ay, "I can't stand 
your selfishness - you w<.lnt to 
die <.Ind spend your whole life 
doing it." Agne herself is too 
old to have the other child he 
always wanted, and even her 
36-year-old daught r <.Iu·e 
her grier because of her limited 
child-bearing potential. The 
other couple. hO-hum Harry

Gold - Jefferson Starship 
(RCA) 

The Jefferson Starship are 
·one of the more remarkable 
Jobs of a late Sixties acid rock 
band re-tooUng.their image so 
that they might fit in the 
Seventies marketplace. The 
original Airplane, if you · 
remember, were a group of 
LSD crazies who espoused the 
Ilorles of chemically expanded 
consciousness years before 
Carlos Castenada got Into the 
act, and in the original form of 
the Starshlp, became paranoid 
revolutionaries (on paper 
anyway) who'd lost allgraspon 
reality, and whose political 
broadsides resembled a 
Psychedelic MelD Kempf. In 
this age of lower expectations, 
though, it's understandable 
that the Starship's rebel stance 
has wizened, and that their 
music has become more 
commercially approachable. 

_lUll! 
10 .. ,-_ ... -

, . ~ 

They've placed themselves 
safely on the record charts with 
a series of hit singles and 
albutns, the sounds of which 
border on the easy-listening lilt 
of Fleetwood Mac, Peter 
Frampton, or The Eagles. 
Lucidly for old Airplane fans, 
the new Starship has produced 
a number of well-crafted hits, 
most of which are on Gold. The 
standout track is Marty Balin's 
"Caroline," a superbly 
produced and arranged soog 
that seamleslly bridles ballad 
land bard rock forma, "Mira-
cles, " perhaps the best song 
ever written with oral love 
references, and "With Your 
Love." 

There will be those die-hard 
rock and roll counter-
cultureites who'lI feel that the 
Starship has betrayed the 
cause, whatever that might be. 
One has to remember, 
however, that the Airplanel 
Starshlp have a formidable 
body of work .. behind them,

complete with stratospheric 
highs and the lowest lows, and 
their momentary upswing on 
the record charts is more than 
anyone could expect from a 
band who, by rights, should 
have burned itaeJf out years ·

Tile Inll. Story - Robben 
Ford (Eleirtra) 

Ford is best known for his 
guitarwork for JoDi Mitcbell 
and Tom Scott, and on IMide 
S&ory, his second solo album. be 
charts a course iD the over-
explored area of Jau-fuDk-
blues-rock. in the tradition of 
Harvey Mandle (Sub and 
Sbrenll'enade) and Jeff Beck 
(Blow By Blow. Wired). On the 
minus side, the material here is 
too familiar, using up the same 
stock riffs, chord changes, and 
tempos that have made most 
recent fusion albums a batch of 
hyper-stylized cliches. On the 
plus side, Ford is a refreshinely 
independent guitarilt. be 
eschews the need · to Imitate 
MacLaughlin, and Coryell. and 
keeps his solos within a blues 
base. His best playing on this 
set are shining examples of how 
to alternate rapid fire, 
cascading scales with co,ent 
bent-note shadings. Ford has a 
passable singing voice as well, 
indicating perhaps a career a 
little wider than the average 
session- guitarist- gone- solo 
shtick. As is, not bad, but one 
expects better in the future. B 
minus. 
Obscure Alternatives - Japan 
(Ariola) 

Japan, who are from Great 
Britain, sound like a forced 
marriage between Mott the 
Hoople and Booker T, and the 
MG's, and they look like 
holdouts from the glitter rock 
movement. They don't impress 
me too much, though I suspect 
that their attempt to revive 
various teenage wasteland 
cliches will make a lot of 
listeners think of the Who at 
their best (Who's Next) . The 
smart ones will realize that 
they've heard this jive before, 
and done better at that. C. 
No Escape - The Marc Tanne~ 
Band (Elektra) 

Simpering love-lorn rock and 
roll mannerisms aimed 
straight at the heartstrings. 
Marc Tanner has one of those 
whispering, overly sensitive 
crooning voices that sends an 
annoyed shiver down your 
spine, a voice coated in self-
pity, fake piety, and hallow 
insight. Tanner reminds one of 
the kind of "liberated male" 
·who, though willing to "deal" 
with his feelings more openly 
than a lot of his more hard-
shelled comrads, remains an 
unchanging basUpn of pre-
conceived notions of how he 
wants his social relations to go. 
I suspect that Tanner may have 
attended some male "con-
sciousness raising" groups not 
to grow as a human being, but 
to secure a new batch of sure 
lire pick up lines. In other 
words, I rarely trust singer-
songwriters who are this 
nakedly "open," The reason I'll 
put up with Paul Simon or 
James Taylor is that they hold 
back. I respect anyone who'll 
tell me that there are matters 
that are none of my business. 
Tanner bears all because he's 
on the make. If you m.ust buy 
this, keep a box of tissue at hand 
to blow the poor boy's nose. D.

Bishop Updates 'Southern-Fried' Rock 
By David Rowe 

Elvin Bishop exists in the 
outer Iimitl of a highly 
commercialiaed rock music 
industry. Hil music and stale 
mannerisma are Just about as 

'Balance'

Not Quite 

.... . 

Rescued 
(Continued from page 11) 
terrorized also by aging and the 
prospect of death, but they 
never isolate this as the 
particular cause of their fear. 
In all, it's a merry sort of story. 

This production, directed by 
Martin Gerrish, is appro-
priately serious, but much too 
ponderous. Thus the case of 
boredom that had me drawing 
pictures on my program. The 
pacing is so incredibly slow that 
it seemed I could sketch a face 
during one character's line, 
and finish up the rest of the 
body before another's 
response. 

Norman Welsh as Tobias 
almost saves the production 
with his fine and interesting 
acting, but the salutatory 
effects he has on the health of 
the show are entirely undone by 
the antidote performance of 
Jean Wilt, who portrays Edna 
in the style of a third rate lady 
evangelist - the kind who 
doesn't even make it on the 5: 30 
am Sunday TV revival shows. 

Mark Donnelly's setting is in 
the tradition of good quality to 
be found in Old Globe Theatre 
productions. His trademark 
appears to be plants - included 
on the set is everything Crom 
marigolds and freesias to 
aspidistras, fraxinellae and 
even a potted yucca. However, 
the specially lighted brass 
scales do no justice to A 
Delll'ate Balance. Their 
illuminated, but not il-
luminating presence before the 
play and dUring intermissions 
is gratuitous. 

Edward Albee fans may like 
this show. 

uncommercial as a performer 
can be and hope to survive. 
With his shirt tails hanling 
half-out of his levis , a 
weathered cowboy hat riding 
high atop his frizzy long brown 

hair, Bishop strolled up to the 
stage over an hour late on 
Sunday evening for his 
performance at the Roxy 
Theatre in Pacific Beach. 

But few were discouraged by 
Bishop's tardiness - his 
following are firm believers 
that what is good is worth 
waiting for. He plugged his 
guitar into the amplifier, 
turned around and gave the 
audience a friendly wave and a 
sheepish grin. If he had been 
jumping up and down 
screaming "rock and roll, " I 
doubt the audience could have 
been more jubilant In its 
welcome. 

Like the rest of the house, I 
was filled with anticipation. I 
had seen Elvin Bishop almost 
four years ago and re-
membered the performance as 
one of the best" southern-fried" 
rock shows I've witnessed. 
Bishop seemed to be holding al\ 
the aces then - pedal steel 
guitar, fiddle, honkytonk piano 
and a second lead guitar that 
allowed for Allman-Betts style 
duos. 

But Bishop is the only 
survivor of the original 
crackerjack band, and his

tattered cowboy hat only a 
reminder of his successful 
sojour:l with the likes of 
Charlie Daniels, Toy Caldwell 
and the rest of the boys from 
Dixie. 

Although Bishop has forgone 
most of the sassy delta music 
that had been his trademark 
only a few years ago, with his 
new band he cranked out old 
favorites like " Travellln ' 
Shoes" and " Hallelujah Rock 
My Soul. " At any rate , it was 
good to hear these songs again , 
even if they lacked the flavor 
they once had. 

But what the band lacked in 
their oldies but goodies 
department, they made up for 
with bluesy jams and snappy 
rockabilJies. Bishop' s group 
played the blues in thetraditiofl 
of the Allman Brothers Band, 
yet retaining a truly distinct 
style due to Bishop's disparate 
treatment of standard blues 
pieces. And rockabilly tunes 
aren't "new wave" in Bishop's 
neck of the woods. Mixing the 
be-bop oC an old fifties song with 
his characteristic hillbilly 
bounce, "Is You Is Or Is You 
Ain't My Baby" prompted 
many in the audience to get up 

and dance in the aisles. 
And once he got the audien('p 

up, he never let them down. 
Bishop has been. renowned for 
his bottleneck guitar leads and 
living up to that reputation in 
concert is standard procedure. 
When the band pi ayed 
"Watermelons, " a song about 
stealing from a farmer 's 
watermelon patch, his 
bottleneck leads were as sweet 
and juicy as the fruit of which 
he sang. 

Of the two saxophonists, 
Jerry Mc Kinney was the 
standout. In the midst of his 
own "Jerry McKinney 's Do 
Any Damn Thing He Wants To 
Blues," McKinney cut loose 
with a free form sax solo that 
was superb. "McKinney 's ... 
Blues " seemed to be an . 
instrumental version of Duane 
Allman's "Stormy Monday," a 
typical twelve-bar blues 
progression used at least once 
by every band whose lead 
guitarist has been influenced 
by Albert King. And when 
Bishop took his turn during the 
jam, the spirits of King and 
Allman seemed to flow from 
Bishop's guitar, and for awhile, 
we all were crying the blues.

fundamental building blocks of 
matter by studying the insides 
of the atom. Masek has been at 
UCSD since 1966 and in this 
time he bas. in his own words. 
"covered the waterfront" in 
nuclear research. His projects 
have ranged from studying 
cosmic rays to his present work 
in what is known as "colliding 
beam" experiments. 

In colliding beam experi-
ments. rather than shooting a 
beam of nuclear particles at a 
fixed target. two such beams 
are made to collide head on. 
The collisions that result have 
much higher energy levels than 
those of fixed target experi-
ments. and the reactions result 
in the formation of new 
particles. 

For the last two years Masek 
has been involved in a project 
shared by groups from UCSD, 
UC Santa Barbara. UC Davis 
and the High Energy Institute 
of Physics of the Netherlands 
with each group responsible for 
one aspecl of the experiment. 

The site of the experiment is 
to be the Positron-Electron-
Project (PEP) colliding beam 
accelerator at Stanford, now 
under construction. PEP will 
use as its source Stanford 's two-
mile-long linear accelerator. 

From the single beam of 
particles it will make two 
separate ones. sending them 
along a roughly circular path in 
opposite directions. At various 
points along the circle. the two 
beams will be brought together 
and made to collide. By 
studying the paths and 
velocities of the particles

is to be the theme for Muir 
College's John Muir Festival 
Week. Beginning Sat. . April 21 . 
John Muir Week will host a 
myriad of activities (or 
students and facu. y. 

Bobbie Gray. Muir College 
program coordinator. said the 
goal of Joh!) Muir Week is to 
"establish a tradition that will 
be long-sta nding and one that 
will help create a college 
identity for all students." Gray 
a dded that a Publicity 
Committee has been organized. 
hea(led by Muir College House 
Advisor Andy Schneider. UCSD 
Visual Arts 'pro(esso~s will be 

asked to submit paintings to 
comprise the bulletin an-
nouncing John Muir Week. 

Gray remarked that she 
hoped the celebration would 
" reflect the philosophy of our 
college as personified by John 
Muir." 

A few of the week's activities 
will include a softball game 
between (acuity and students, a 
Wilderness Club presentation 
and a three mile job. There will 
be a photo and essay contest for 
students in which cash prizes 
will be awarded, and (acuity 
will donate books they have 
written to the winners. 

Muir House Advisors will set 
up booths. and bands will 
perform live on the Muir Quad 
throughout the week. 

On April 1, John Muir's 
birthday. all Muir students will 
receive ice cream and cake.

No :theast Losing Money on Pe'ntagon 
Urban Centers Outside of the Sun Belt Are Giving More R.evenue 
MIlitary Than They're Getting, San Diego Is Raking In the Dollars 

By J .... na'han Wolman 
AP Urbu Affairs WrUer 

WASHINGTON - An analysis of 
military spending and tax payments in 
the nation's 40 largest urban areas 
indicates that dozens of urban 
communities underwrite a flood of 
Pentagon money headed for Western 
cities. 

The study, released yesterday by 
Employment Research Associates, 
bolsters recent congressional charges 
that federal spending priorities are 
hurting many of the nation's big, older 
cities. 

" The Pentagon is spearheading a 
massive relocation of wealth at a time 
that many cities can least afford it," 
says Marion Anderson, an economic 
historian who co-authored the 
" Pentagon Tax" study. 

Anderson and her husband , 
Professor 'J ames Anderson of Michigan 
State University, examined 1977 budget 

da~ to determine how much tax money 
collected in the nation's 40 largest 
metropolitan areas is earmarked for 
military spending, and how much of 
that money comes back from the 
Pentagon in salaries and contracts. 

Of the 40 urban areas,lS receive more 
in military expenditures than they pay 
out in "military" taxes. About half the 
"winners" are Western cities, and six of 
them are in California, including San 
Diego. 

By contrast, 25 of the 40 urban areas 
were net losers - including 10 of 11 
cities in the Midwest, six of nine in the 
Northeast and seven of the nine largest 
Southern or Southwestern cities. 

Employment Research Associates is 
a Lansing, Mich. , research and 
consulting firm that conducts studies 
relating to the impact of military 
spending on employment. 

The firm's urban study, a by-
product of an ongoing effort to trace 
Pentagon dollars by congressional 
district , provides little surprise; it has 
long been known that Pentagon money 
was spent primarily in the Sun Belt 
states . But the figures provide new 
ammunition to the Northeast-Midwest 
Congressional Coalition, which seeks to 
adjust the imbalance. . 

The coalition released a study of its 
own yesterday indicating that efforts to 
boost federal procurement and 
~mployment in declining central cities 

are lagging. 
Rep. Robert Edgar, D-Pa., chairman 

of the coalition, said longtime federal 
policies ha ve "actually hastened the 

, exodus of government jobs from the 
nation's central cities." 

Anderson said military spending 
- 24 cents out of every federal dollar -
is a prime example of these policies. 

According to Employment Research 
Associates, the Washington, D.C. area, 
home of the Pentagon, had the largest 
net gain from military spending in 1977, 
receiving $3.1 billion more than 
residents paid in military taxes. 

But on a per-family basis, San Jose 
fared nearly as well, and San Diego was 
not far behind. In California, the Los 
Angeles, Anaheim, Riverside-San 
Bernardino and Sacramento areas also 
showed net gains. 

The aerospace centers of Seattle, St. 
Louis and Long Island all showed large 
net gains, along with a north-
eastern naval city - Providence, R.I., 
and San Antonio, Texas, home of five 
military bases. Dallas and Baltimore 
also fared well. 

On a per-family basis, the people in 
the Miami area ~ot the least return 

from its Pentagon tax dollar. Miami lost 
$747 million in the tax-spending trade-
of(. That means a (amily of four sent 
$2,100 more to the Pentagon than it got 
back. 

The net loss in Chicago was $1,900 per 
family, and in New York, Cleveland, 
Newark and Rochester it came to 
$1,800. . 

In the West, San Francisco-Oakland 
was a net loser, along with Portland, 
Ore . ' 

Interns. 
(Coadalled from pale 1) 
the present time only through Warren 
College, which requires non-Warren 
students "to petition, a simple 
'Procedure, he said. . 

Eventually, Lofgren hopes to see 
internship offices on each of the college 
campuses. sending interns not only 
throughout the county. but to State and 
Federal offices too. 

Beyond the help this would represent 
to the AS and student body in general, 
Lofgren stresses the value holding an 
internship ~n. It~"ye to the intern.
