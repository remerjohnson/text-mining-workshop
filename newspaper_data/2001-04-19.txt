Athletes 
Plea for 
Fee Funds 
Athletic director f ars that 
programs may be cut 
By CARRIE ELIZABETH SKLAR 
Staff Writer 

, Athletic Director Earl Edwards said 
Wednesday that the continued existence of 
UCSD's athletic program as it now exists may 
depend on the passage of the Campus Life Fee 
Referendum. 

The referendum, which would impkl11ent 
an increase of $71.40 per student each quarter, 
would allot $19 of that additional fcc to the 

CM athletic program. 
Edwards warned the athletes from such 

teams as baskctball, crew, and track and tidd 
thai should tIll' referendum f,111 to pass, thL' ,lIh-
letic program would n:ceivc ,I cnppitng monc-
tary blow from which it ma not fully n:tOI"Cr. 

"If it passes, we Will be able w contlnuL' IIlIh 
the athletic program as II'l' knoll' II tl1d,I~', " 
Edwards said. 

Edwards went on to say that II'lIhoUI thl' ke 
increase, "half our budget would not be avail-
able to us." 

Edwards said this would IllC;111 that IhL' 
administration would have to senollsl\, C01l51d-

future. 

"We might have to downsize our progr'lIll If 
we don 't have the revenue:' Edwards said. 
Thcre are currently 23 sports teams al UCSD. 

However, Edwards also Said the athktic pro-
gram has not begun to seriously consider how 
many or which tcams would be considered for 
cutt ing. 

"We haven't set up cri teria yec" he said .

Global Wanning Traced to Humans 
Scripps Researchers find ocean temperature rise in oceans can possibly be attributed to carbon 
By STEVE LEHTONEN 
Staff Writer 

Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography researchers Tim 
Barnett and David Pierce have 
pinpointed human-induced global 
warming in the earth's oceans. 

Their recent findings have the 
potential to solidify the belief that 
global warming over the past 50 
years--has been a direct result of 
human activity. 
. Barnett and Pierce ran a series 

of studies testing ocean tempera-
tures as deep as 3,000 meters. 

"The change is profound,· 
Pierce said. 

The pair found an overall 
change in ocean temperature of 
O.l-degree Celsius, and an average 
0.4-degree Celsius rise was found 
at the ocean's surface 

"The temperature increase may 
not seem like a lot: Pierce said. 
"However, it takes a' tremendous 

amount of energy to heat the 
world's oceans to that extent." 

Barnett also validated the find-
ings by noting the pre~ision of the 
thermometers used in the study. 

The thermometers, according 
to Barnett, can detect 0.2-degree 
Celsius changes in temperature. 

Many scientists attribute these 
changes in temperature to carbon 
dioxide and sulfur emissions. In 
the past 50 years, the emission of 
these products is said to have 
heated the atmosphere and, as 
Barnett and Pierce's study sug-
gests, the ocean temperatures as 
well. 

Most studies regarding the 
issue of global warmin'g have 
focused on atmospheric tempera-
tures. Barnett and Pierce's study 
concentrated on the effects on the 
ocean. 

Barnett said he is confident in 
the recent findings. 

"The Initial resultS' are certainly 

compatible at the 95 percent con-
fidence level with the hypothesis 
that the warming observed in the 
global oceans has been ca used by 
anthropogenic sources," Barnett 
said. 

The study was only meant as a 
preliminary observation of the 
effects of global warming. The 
implications of the heating of thc 
environment are, as of now, some-
what of a mystery. 

"We don't have the programs 
or the government organization to 
assess what this is going to mean 
for the average American: Barnett 
said. "The average Californian 
doesn't care about a three-degree 
rise in the temperature:' 

Barnett said he wished people 
would take action by urging the 
government to mobilize and creatc 
a better understanding of the 
greenhouse effect. 

"Tell people to write their con-
gr.essman ~nd ask them what the 

greenhouse effect is going to do to 
our lives," Barnett said. 

Pierce also noted the U.S. gov-
ernmen t's lagging status com-
pared to other developed nations 
in terms of greenhouse effect 
research. 

"Germany, Britain and Japan all 
have programs to assess the grecn-
house effect:' Pierce said. "I would 
have thought America would be 
on the forefront of this endeavor 
but it is not the case." 

The National Oceanographic 
and Atmospheric Associatioll 
Climate Change Dat,l and 
Detection program and the U.S. 
Departlllellt of Encrgy supponcd 
the work of Barnett and PiercL'. 

Barnett and Pierce a Iso worked 
with colleague Reiner Schnur, who 
was supported by thc Max Planck 
Institute for Meteorolology. 

Their findings were published 
in the April 13 edition of the sci-
entific journal Science.

crucial, should the removal of teams 
become necessary, is the ratio of male to 
female teams. 

"It would be suicide to drop any female 
sports because of the Title IV lawsuit ," 
Edwards said. 

This said, Edwards and Matthew 
DeFord, the representative for the athle tic 
program in the student committee that 
drafted the referendum, launched a plea for 
all athleteS to encourage students to vote 
next week. 

Voting will begin Monday, April 23, and 
end Friday, April 27. Twelve polling booths 
stationed throughout campus will be open 
from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. all week. 

- Four thousand students must vote in the 
special election for the fee to be el igible to 
pass. Once the required 4,OOO-vote mini-
mum is reached, a simple majority is needed 
for the fee to pass. 

"Basically, if 3,000 people vote and 2,900 
of those votes are in favor of the referendum, 
it can't pass," DeFord said. "We have to have 

4,000 people vote: 
DeFord said that the athletic program has 

al ready acquired powerful allies in its quest 
to attain the needed votes. 

"We already have on our side the sports 
clubs, the Greek system and several college · 
counsels," he said. 

However, DeFord said that the people 
who vote "no" are not his main concern. 

"It's the people who don't vote at all who 
are our biggest threat," DeFord stressed. 

Because the voting will not be available 
via StudentLink, Edwards warned athletes 
that encouraging people to vote was a prior-
ity. 

"We've never had 4,000 students vote for 
anything at UCSD, either for or against," he 
said. 

DeFord said that in addition to the 500 to 
600 athletes urging students to vote, a sub-
committee will be handing out literature 
about the Campus Life Referendum to edu-
cate and inform slUdents. 

"It's not an ath letic fee," Edwards 
stressed. "It involves all students." 

Duncan McFarland, women's volleyball 
coach, echoed this sentiment. 

"It's cenainly very important for our team 
as well as other teams," he said. "It will 
increase fees fo r everyone but it will benefit 
everyone as well."

Fee Increase Will 
Improve UCSD Life 

Special election voting for the Campus 
Life Fee Referendum will begin Monday, 
April 23, and end Friday, April 27. 

The fee is intended to improve student 
life at UCS D through the expansion of the 
University Centers, and to increase funding 
of student services, student organizations, 

CAA athletics, sports facilities, the A.S. 
Council and the individual colleges. 

Like all UCSD referendums before it, 
and any that may come in the future, this 
referendum and the process by which it was 
drafted are not perfect. The Guardian, how-
ever, thinks that the potential benefits of the 
referendum far outweigh its cost - and at 
$71 .40 per student per quarter, the cost is 
certainly not small. 

UCS D will expand its undergraduate 
enroll ment to arou nd 30,000 by 2010, 
which is about a 50 percent increase from 
today's numbers. 

Each year, more student organizations 
request fu nding, the Price Center and Stu-
dent Center become more crowded during 
peak hours, seats are harder to find in study 
lounges and libraries, and meeting spaces 
become more difflcult to reserve. These 
problems will only worsen un less they are 
addressed now. 

Simply put, any remedy for these problems 
costs money - a lot of it. It is the position of 
the Guardian that the proposed Campus Life 
Fee would address these problems in a time-
ly, fair and effective manner. 

Specifically, the Campus Life Fee propos-
es increased fund ing fo r the International 
Center, the Women's Center, the Lesbian, 
Gay, Bisexual & Tra nsgender Resou rce 
Office and the Graduate Student Organiza-
tion . These student services need the fee to 
even maintain, let alone improve their level 
of service to students. 

Almost 40 percent of the proposed fee 
would go to expanding the University Cen-
ters. This is by far the biggest chunk of 
change allocated to anyone item. 

This money would fund the expansion of 
the Price Center and renovation ·of the Stu-
dent Center, both of which would begin 
immediately following the referendum, 
should it pass. It is crucial to expand and 
improve these spaces to better serve the 
growing UCSD community, and the pro-
posed plans for the expansion are extreme-
ly well-thought-out. 

Another item receiving a large portion of 
the proposed fee is CM intercollegiate ath-
letics. Because of UCSD's immensely popular 
move to Division II , the ath letics department 
needs to expand its resources to duplicate the 
uccess UCSD achieved in Division III . With-

out extra funding, this cannot be a reality. 
The fee is expensive. However, despite 

what the proposed fee 's opponents say, it is 
imperative to understand that the fee would 
be fully covered by additional financial aid 
offeri ngs. This fac t is confirmed in writing 
from the Office of Financial Aid . _ . 

The Guardian has mixed feelings about the 
process by which the referendum was draft-
ed. Ideally, it would have not been initiated by 
the administration. However, the quality of 
the final product far outweighs this concern.

Revisiting Old Wounds: The Tragedy 
of the Oklahoma City BOlllbing 

The imminent release of a controversial book about the terrorist act and the 
scheduled execution date of the man behind it, forc~s America to confront its past 
By TOM VU 
Opinion Editor 

It only seems fi tting that as April 19 
arrives, an article is written to observe one 
of the most tragic events in our country's 
history: the Oklahoma City bombing. 

It has been six years since the terror-
ist bombing killed 168 people, 19 of 
whom were children, and still the scars 
have not healed. In fact, some have pro-
fessed that the wounds have bee n 
reopened for a few reasons. The first is 
that the scheduled execution of Timothy 
McVeigh is arriving soon; the day of 
emotional release for those murdered 
and their families is set at May 16. The; 
second reason is the recent release of a 
new book about the bombing, which 
also includes interviews with McVeigh. 

The controversy surrounding the 
book, titled "American Terrorist," and 
the interviews in it is that it presents 
McVeigh's story of the crime and his 
embi ttered life. Tom Morganthau of 
Newsweek writes, "IMcVeighl claims total 
responsibility for the worst act of domes-
tic terrorism in American history" in the 
book. 

Families of those killed are angered by 
how the book approaches this still-painful 
subject. "ILou) Michel and [Dan) Herbeck 
have been denounced by some for exploit-
ing tragedy, for being too willing to accept 
McVeigh's version of events and for pro-
viding McVeigh with a national platform 
from which to advance his claim to politi-
cal martyrdom," Morganthau stated. 

Indeed, the sixth anniversary of the 
bombing has scratched at an unhealed 
wound, hurting not only the families of 
those killed, but all Americans. Rarely' 
before the bombing did we consider a ter-
rorist attack within our own borders and 
by our own citizens a 'possibility, but the 
explosion that ripped apart the Murrah 
Federa l Building likewise ripped apart 
America's innocence. It was a hard slap of 
reality for a country that had considered 
itself above the terrorist violence that has 
plagued Israel and orthern Ireland. 
. The memory of the Oklahoma City 

bombing has burned itself into the fabric 
of AmQican society. The wtiters of the 

book compare speaking to McVeigh with 
sitting down with Lee Harvey Oswald or 
John Wilkes Booth. This being the case, it 
can be easily argued that the bombing was 
an important and course-changing part of 
our history, just as integral as the assassi-
nations of presidents John F. Kennedy and 
Abraham Lincoln. 

Many older Americans often say that 
they remember distinctly what they were 
doing when they heard over their radios 
that Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. 
So, too, I think, can people recall what 
they were doing when the news of the 
bombing was first broadcast. 

I can remember exactly what I was 
doing on April 19, 1995. I was still in the 
10th grade and had just come home from 

People will see how 
remorseless this man, who 
views the death of the 
children as collateral damage, 
truly is. And when he is 
executed, he will simply fade 
into history. Nothing more. 
nothing less, 

school. I stepped in and my mom, who 
was starting to cook dinner at the time, 
told me that there was a bombing. 

"No, it must've been in Israel or somE;-
thing," I said. looking briefly at the news 
coverage on the television, not even think-
ing that a terrorist attack of such a magni-
tude was possible in this country. 

But my mother was correct. I stood 
silently as the camera panned over the 
devastation and confusion, the crowds of 
people around the. area and what was left 
of the building after half of it, along with 
168 men, women and children, was blown 
to oblivion. The pictures left to us are like-
wise ingrained in our memories. Who can 
forget the now world-famous Newsweek 
cover of the firefighter cradling the body of 
a dead child, one of the 19 children who 
died? 

"American Terrorist~ is another chap-
ter in a book many Americans had origi-
nally thought to be closed. Some people 
are afraid that this exposure will only give 
McVeigh the attention that he craves and 
transform him into a martyr. I don't think 
such a thing will come close tp happening. 
In fact, the exact opposite will happen: The 
book will amplify how insane McVeigh is 
NOT, but rather how cold and calculating 
he is. People will see how remorseless this 
man, who views the death of the children 
as "collateral damage," truly is. And when 
he is executed, he will simply fade into his-
tory. Nothing more, nothing less. 

The scare and hype over the rise of 
militias has similarly come and gone. The 
bombing gave the militias exactly what 
they, like little kids, ' wanted: attention. 
And now, more than half a decade later, 
militias are a thing of the past after . 
achieving their 15 minutes of fame. 
Good-bye and good riddance. 

Former Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright wrote in an article after the Aug. 
7, 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies 
in Kenya and Tanzania, "Let Ithe terror-
ists) have no illusions. We will not be 
intimidated." 
. As a country, we have survived tragedy 

after tragedy and we have not been intim-
idated. We have stared down the petty and 
paranoid groups that try to bully the 
nation into seeing the world through their 
own myopic eyes. What does not tear us 
apart can only make us $U'onger, can only 
open our eyes to reality. 

We are not any more safe from the IRA, 
Hezbolah or Hamas. Unfortunately, it 
took the deaths of 168 people to learn this. 
But, as Albright continued, "To give in to 
terror, or hide from it, is not an option." 

The bombing - now six years in the 
past - and the people that tried to terror-
ize the nation are merely an insubstantial 
premoni tion of the past. With McVeigh's 
execution date arriving in less than a 
month, perhaps the fi nal chapter can at 
last be written. Ever since he committed 
his heinous crime, McVeigh's existence 
has been a stain on the fabric of American 
society. Good-bye and good riddance. TIle 
sooner he starts burning in hell, the bet-
ter. . .....

A Delicious Recipe for a Perf.a World Guardian Should Have 
Run Reparations Ad 

PARISA BAHARIAN 

A s I was floating through Disneyland's famous attraction "It's a Small 
World" this weekend, the mes-
sage it proudly sung - of aware-
ness of all that we have in com-
mon as the key to cultural unity 
and a more perfect world - hit 
me as overly simplistic and not at 
all realistic. 

After experiencing the entire 
. ride, 1 was convinced it was a very 
poor attempt to brainwash peo-
ple into cultural appreciation and 
unity. 

The ride began by displaying 
the cultural pride of many dif-
ferent ethnic groups through 
the media of song, dance and 
dress. It was evident that the 
intent of the first part of the ride 
was io build up one's cultural 
pride by the fact that the differ-
ent ethnic groups were dis-
played separately from each 
other. 

Yet as we floated through the 
ride, the focus shifted. By the 
end, there was a massive display 
of cultural integration and a 
show of superficial unity that was 
supposedly achieved by the 
awareness of all our similarities, 
making it a "small world after 
all ." 

What bothered me most 
about the ride was the message 
that was played over and over: 
"There's so much that we share, 
that it's time we 're aware, it's a 
small world after all ." 

This overly simplistic mes-
sage - that cultural unity is 
easily achievable once we all 

have an awareness of how 
much we all have in common 
and that it is a small world in 
which we'll all live happily ever 
after - is merely a false build-
up with a hard fall once the 
realities of the world are taken 
into account. 

Thus I rate the "Small 
World" exhibit as a poor 
attempt to brainwash people to 
become more peace loving, 
nonviolent and tolerant. It 
failed to dig beneath the surface 
to discover and address the true 
roots as to why there is so much 
racially motivated violence in 
our world. 

Why was an African-Ameri-
can tow truck driver beaten 
within an inch of his life in my

foundation of hate, and

spark by which hate 
spreads. 
hometown of Concord,Califor-
nia? Why did a person or group 
of people on our campus deface 
the property of the MEChA stu-
dent organization with mes-
sages of hate last week? Why 
did the Cincinnati police shoot 
an unarmed 19-year-old 
African-American student to 
death last week? 

The list of hate crimes and 
police brutality is endless, yet 
there doesn't seem to be any 
clear or easy answer to the ques-
tion of why there is hate in our 
world. 

The question that's been 
gnawing at me is: How does this 
hate form ? 

1 offer this idea: Many times 
hate stems from ignorance of 
others' lifestyles and cultures. 
Because of this ignorance, atti-
tudes toward others who are per-
ceived to be different by either 
skin color or culture, for 
instance, are thel} formed by 
judgments based solely on 
stereotypes. 

I see ignorance as the founda-
tion of hate, and our society's 
silence in stamping it out is the 
spark by which hate spreads. 

Since I was extremely disap-
pointed that the "It's a Small 
World" exhibit didn't probe very 
deeply, and instead just glossed 
the realities of our world over 
with a happy tune and an unreal-
istic and unattainable happy 
ending to bringing our world 
together, I decided I would try to 
create a recipe by which our 
society can form a more perfect 
world. 

The following is a recipe for a 
perfect world: 

First step - Dissolve all igno-
rance, judgmental attitudes, hate, 
intolerance and viol'!nce into 
four cups of water. 

Second step - Heat large 
cauldron on stove. 

Third step - Pour polluted 
water into hot cauldron. 

Fourth step - Turn stove up 
to highest level and let polluted 
water boil. 

Fifth step - Let cauldron boil 
until water bubbles and simmers 
over. 

Sixth step - Turn stove off 
and pour the now-pure water 
ipto a large bowl. 

Seventh step - Mix in: 
a) one tablespoon desire to 

learn about others' cultures and

Editor: 
I think it is utterly detestable 

that you censored David 
Horowitz's ad, "Ten Reasons Why 
Reparations for Slavery are a Bad 
Idea - and Racist Too." 

When did editors ot college 
papers become the ultimate 
arbiters of the decision on what 
political opinions are valid to 
print? The Guardian has no qualms 
printing 'ad hominem assaults on 
President Bush for free, but when 
Horowitz asks ·to pay to print his 
legitimate viewpoints, which may 
enrage some on the left , the edito-
rial staff censors i t. Nor does the 
Guardian have any problem wi th 
picking and choosing which politi-
cal advertisements to print. What is 
this but blatant censorship? 

Additionally, this is an assault 

on free speech righ t ~l1titl~d to all 
Americans by the Constitution . 
Simply because an ad may cxpr~ss 
opinions considered to be very 
poli tically incorrect, that does not 
invalidate its righ t to be heard . I 
sincerely hope you will reconsider 
your decision and prin t the ad .

Concerni ng the April 9 article 
titled "UCSD Admi ts Mor~ 
Underrepresented Students," the 
Cali fo rnia State-wide Affirmative 
Action Coalition disagrees. 

Wi th regards to affirma tive 
action, the art icle is constructed 
to portray so-called minorities as 
benefactors of the American sys-
tem, which stands in opposi tion 
to the logic behind affi rma tive 
action . Defi ni ng stude nts of co lor 
as ·students of et hnic bac k-
grounds" hides the reality that 
white people have ethnic back-
grou nds. The expressions "given 
adva ntages" and "awards" dis tort 
the rea lity of affirmative ac tion, 
which is a program to countaact 
the systems of advantages set up 
to privi lege white ma les. 

Statements such as "Students 
are becoming better prepared fo r a 
UCS D education, " other than 
being comple tely in co hercn t 
logistically, offer no substance or 
reali ty to the issue of underrepre-
sen ted stude nt acceptance at

6 OPINION 

Letters: 
UCSD misled public with 
its vision of equality 
continued from page 5 
enroll ments of so-ca lled minori -
ties have contin ually decreased 
are many, with an emphasis on 
the quali ty campus life. Students 
who co me to UCS D are over-
whelmed by the lack of commu-
nity support for them. S tud~ nt 
communities are small and over-
worked on campus and students 
don't see themselves represented 
in fac ulty or staff. 

With regards to life on ca m-
pus, the art icle quoted Assistant 
Vice e ha ncellor Richard Backer 
stating, "We get so many applica-
tions because we are a great un i-
versi ty ... that provides a firs t-rate 
... social experience." If the ml:a-
sure of this university was based 
on the socia l experience lived by 
studen ts of color, then the ti rst-
rate status rests with in the co m-
fort-zone of white-norm poli tics. 
This campus is extremely apa-
thetic to th e racia l oppression 
that affects people of color in 
every way. Ei ther it's nobody si t-
ling next to you in lecture, igno-
ra nt professors, or Ralph Nader 
attribu ting the lack of so-called 
minority turn-out to a lack of 
perso nal drive. Just ask Ward 

Connerly or Peter Preuss, and 
I'm sure they would agree with 

ader that there are no signs 
posted saying "No Black People 
Allowed" or "Hispanics [ahem! 1 
Not Welcome: But the signs 
don't need to be posted; their 
message is broadcast loud and 
clear. 

So it seems UCSD is the 
"best-kept secret in Southern 
California," when you attribute 
the lack of public knowledge on 
the workings of racism to the 
construction of UCSD as a pub-
lic body. And if the current tra-
jectory of UCSD is now th e 
backbone of goals such as "[mak-
ingl the quality of campus life as 
strong as possible," then I have 
some encouraging statistics for 
prospective white students that 
might shed some light on th e 
reality of the statistical propagan-
da churned out by UCSD admis-
sions. If you look at UCSD's past 
ten-yea r history you may see 
something "to be alarmed 
about ," as first-year Native 
Ame rica n enrollment has 
decreased by 46 percent arid 
Africa n-Americans haven't hit 3 
percent of UCSD's first -year 
population si nce 1990, dropping 
67 percen!. 

Maybe you would argue with 
Assis tan t Vi ce Chancell or 
Backer, whose logic would sug-
gest UCSD isn't academically

Students Made 
Admit Day a Success 
Editor: 

On behalf of the Office of 
Admissions and Relations wi th 
Schools, I offer my si ncerest 
thanks to all of you who enthusi-
astically gave your time and ener-
gy to help with our spring admis-
sion programs, projects and 
events. Again this year, UCSD's 
number of applications soared to 
a record height. As soon as the 
students received their admission 
packets, our office launched into 
a number of "yield" activ ities to 
ensure that they vis ited the 
UCSD ca mpus and that they 
made the right choice of universi-
ty. 

Nearly 1,700 admitted fresh-
men received telephone ca lls 
frol1\ you, as you answered th&ir 
questions and encouraged their 
enrollment for the fal l. You led 
campus tours for thousands of 
students and their families. You 
received rave reviews from stu-
dents and parents alike as you 
served on student panels and 
spoke before audiences at admis-
sion receptions and presenta-
tions. 

Our partnership with you is 
invaluable. Together we can make 
a difference on this ca mpus 
because we know that UCSD is its 
students. 

Not only do we have a goal to 
admit the top students in Cali-
fornia to UCSD, we also work 
hard to achieve a diverse campus. 
Your dedication to helping us 
enroll those admitted students 
from traditionally underrepre-
sented ethnic groups means so

NORML: Keeping Stoners 
Out of Prison Since 1970 
By RINALDO DORMAN 
Staff Wnter 

"You '\'~ got to tight for your right 
to pa rt)'." 

- Beastie Boys 

In i\ I11 L'nca today, we wage a 
v~ry n:al wa r on drugs. We spend 
billions O il it , and hundreds of 
thL)us,lnLis of arrests arc made ' 
c\'cry Far. The ratl' of arrest for 
lllariJuana offenses is roughly one

I'our Sltk of the light. 

Onl' slIch group IS the ation-
al Organization for the Rcform of 
:V1.triiu3n3 Laws, which started in 
1970. ThiS is a national organiza-
lion composed of a head office in 
Washi ngton, and made up of Slate 
and local chapters, though there is 
no chapter in San Diego. The Web 
site, Ilttp:llwww. nonnl.org, serves as 
both th e history of marijuana's 
criminalization and the up-to-date 
state of affa irs al\ across the coun-
try. 

Marijuana's history in the Unit-
ed Statcs extends over 400 years 
ago as hemp, when it was used in 
the Amcricas as a fi ber, al\ the way 
through the 20th century. In addi-
tion, its presence as medicine and 
111 American medical journals has 
been around for almost as long. 

As the 1930s saw the end of 

alcohol prohibition, the institution 
tha t dealt with upholdi ng and 
enforcing anti-liquor laws fo und 
itsdf wi th no th ing to do. At the 
same ti me, the U.S. government 
was looki ng for a way to get Mexi-
ca n workers out of the United 
States beca use migrant workers 
were no longer seen as beneficia l. 

Kris Krane, affi liate coordinator 
of NORML's national offi ce, said, 

"People need to get 
active and talk to their 
pOliticians and tell them 
how strongly they feel 
about this issue. Not 
many people realize 
quite how affective this 
really is." 

- Kris Krane 
NORML 

"The government found that many 
of these workers used marijuana in 
some fo rm , and that few Americans 
outside this select group had any 
exposure to what marijuana is or 
does." with the exception of the 
African-American Jazz scene. 
When the Federal Bureau of Nar-
cotics formed in 1930, the new 
image of "weed." or the "Devil 
weed," was born , and hemp 
became widely known as marijua-
na.

ion, the FB N, headed by Commis-
sioner Harry Anslinger, began the 
misinformation war that brought 
the ultra-violent and insa nity-
inducing image of "reefer smok-
ing" to the populous via the media. 
Exaggerated headlines and movies 
like "Reefer Madness" created an 
image of marijuana as leading to 
rape, murder and always ultimately 
to total insanity and death. 

The result was the Marijuana 
Tax Act of 1937, which Krane said 
was a way to circumvent the prob-
lem of criminalizing marijuana. 
"The problem was that people did-
n't think you could make marijua-
na illegal without an amendment 
to the constitution, just like they 
did with liquor," Crane said , "So 
they taxed marijuana instead." 

"To have marijuana you would 
need to get a stamp saying that you 
had paid the tax, but there was 
never any intention of allowing 
anyone to procure marijuana: 
Crane continued. "The intent was 
overtly prohibition ." 

As for the passing of the Mari-
juana Tax Act, the hearings lasted 
on ly an hour. "The two main wit-
nesses were Anslinger, who created 
the Tax Act, and Clinton Hester, 
assistant general counsel for the 
Department of the Treasury, who 
both were in support." Crane said. 

The lone voice of opposition to 
Congress was the American Med-
ical Association, which was repre-
sented by legis la ti~e councilmem-
ber Dr. William C. Woodward.

Woodward concl ude\! with 
remarks on the problems of cutting 
physicia ns off from a therapeutic 
substance. Congress saw this as ItI -
tie more then standing in the way 
of legis lative progress. 

The House of Representatives' 
handl ing of the bill was very shady. 
According to NORM L's Web site, 
less thm 90 seconds of "debate" 
took place during which only two 
questions were asked. First, House 
Speaker Sam Rayburn was asked to 
summarize the bi ll. He replied, "I 
don't know. It has something to do 
With a thing ca lled marijuana . I 
think it is a narcotic of some kind ." 

The second question was 
rcga rdmg whether the AMA sup-
ported the act, to which a member 
of the Ways and Means Committee 
sa id they ' did. After continumg to 
sai l through both houses with east:, 
President rranklin Roosevelt 
promptly signed the legislation into 
law Aug. '2,1937. 

The "Manhuana Tax Aet" lOok 
d1'cCI Oct. 1 oi that year. This is 
how things have stood at the feder-
al !.::vel to this day. 

The past points to the pn:sent 
- can an individual make a differ-
cncc? Krane's response was next to 
pleading. He insisted we can make 
a dramatic effect if we are willing to 
write and call our elected officials. 

"What we constantly hear from 
poli ticians is that they won 't sup-
port an issue when they on ly hear 
from constituents who oppose it," 
Krane said. 

NORML's Web site includes 
forms that can be printed out and 
mailed to government officials. 
Also, there are action alerts for 
local areas that have impending 
bills. 

"It shouldn 't be limited only to 
when there is a bill being brought 
up," Krane said. "Constantly, I

would say at least once a month,

they arc beholden to you. If you 
live in someone's district, they have 
to listen to you, and they will take 
your phone call . If they are n't 
there, their staff will take note of 
what you say. 

"People need to get active and 
talk to their politicians and tell 
them how strongly they fee l about 
this issue: Krane continued. "Not 
many people realize quite how

NORML: 
Pot tokers abound should 
be wary of Okalahorna 
ContInued from page 10 
how you feel; tell them you want to 
stop arresting people who smoke 
marijuana . Tell them you want 
patients to have access to medicinal 
marijuana . Tell them that students 
should not be denied financial aid 
because of drug convictions." 

Krane emphasized why it is so 
important for students to get 
iovolved in the fight. 

"As of two years ago, with the 
passin,8 of a provision to the High-
er Education act, if you have a drug 
conviction, you are denied finan-
cial aid for one year," he said. "Two 
convictions, two years - more 
than that, and you are barred for 
life from receiving financial aid. 
Now what's more damaging? 
Smoking marijuana, or being cut 
off from a college education? And 

_who does that affect? Not the rich 
kids w.ho are getting their educa-
tion paid for. It's poor and minori-
ty kids who get slammed. Students 
really need to get involved on these 
issues." 

Krane encourages all marijuana 
smokers to join NORML to help it 
lobby for marijuana smokers' 
rights. 

"If you are ,\ ma rijuana smoklT, 
you almost have an obltgallo n to 
joi n a group like NORML, who's 
trying to kcep you out of Jail 
That 's what we do, and our IlICIll-
bers give the monq to I bby, and 
number power to back up our lob-
bymg." 

Shon on cash? Don't thll1k 
you can afford J mcmbLTslllp? 
Krane hds the answer. "Buy )111': 
less eighth a year and spend that 
money on helping us keep YOLi ou t 
of prison." 

Krane closed with one final 
word of warning about the most 
oppressive state in the L1nion 
toward marijuana: "Stay out of 
Oklahoma," and if you are a mari-
juana smoker who lives there, "get 
the hell out."

In actuality, "cannabis" is an 
umbrella term for two botani-
cal strains of marijuana: 
cannabis indica and cannabis 
sativa. Although they both con-
tain the active ingredient THC, 
their differences are quite sub-
stantial to regular and casual 
smokers alike. Here's the liter-
ature, but the truly curious will 
go taste the differences. 
Indica: Indicas originally 
come from the hash produc-
ing countries, They are short, 
dense plants with broad 
leaves and often grow a dark-
er green . After flowering starts 
they will be mature in six to 

ei~ht weeks. The buds will be 
thick and dense, with flavors 
and aromas ranging from 
pungent skunk to sweet and 
fruity. The smoke from an Indi-
ca is generally a light body 
high, relaxing and laid back.

Sativa: Sativas are just about 
the opposite of indicas. They 
are tall , thin plants with much 
narrower leaves and grow a 
lighter green in color. They 
grow very quickly and can 
reach heights of 20 feet in a 
single season . Once flowering 
has begun , they can take any-
where from 10 to 16 weeks 
to fully mature. Ravors range 
from earthy to sweet and 
fruity. The stone-effect of a 
Sativa is cerebral and ener-
getic. 

Cross Strains: Cross strains 
offer the best Sativa and 
Indica have to offer. Most 
cross-strains enjoy the small-
er size of Indica plants (ideal 
for indoor growing), but con-
tain the energetic high of 
sativas.

NORML: 
6 00, 000 arrests in 
1995 due to cannabis 
Continued 'rom page 11 
• Presently, law enforcement 
arrests a marijuana smoker every 
45 seconds. This represents a 60 
percent increase in mar ijuana 
arrests since Cl inton took o ffi ce. 
• Over 10 mi llion Americans have 
been arres ted on marijuana 
charges since the National Com-
mission on M arijuana and Drug 
Abuse issued its recommendation 
to Congress in 1972 to decr iminal-
ize marijuana. . 
• Blacks and Hispanics make up 20 
percent of the marijuana smokers 
in the United States but comprise 
58 percent o f the mar ij uana 
offenders sentenced under federal 
law last year. 
• Between 1978 and 1996, 34 states 
passed laws recognizing marij ua-

Hager: 

na's therapeutic value. 
• Annual federal government 
expenditures on the "war on 
drugs" average $15.7 billion annu-
ally. In addition, state and local 
governments also spend $16 bil-
lion per year enforcing drug laws. 
• In 1995, nearly 600,000 of the 
total 1.5 mi llion drug arrests in 
America were for marijuana 
offenses. 
• The Supreme Court has ruled 
that law enforcement does not 
need a search warrant to search 
your garbage. The rationale is that 
by discarding refuse, you are relin-
quishing ownership and privacy 
over it. Because this makes garbage 
public property, police can search 
your garbage for stems and seeds 
to get a search warrant for your 
house. 
• Marijuana prohibi tion costs 
American taxpayers between $7.5 
and $10 billion annually in 
enforcement alone. 
• M arijuana remains the third 

The UCSD Guardian 

most popular recreational drug of 
choice in the United States despite 
60 years of criminal prohibition. 
Only alcohol and tobacco are regu-
larly consumed by a greater per-
centage of the population. 
• United States Department of 
Health and Human Services found 
that 57 percent of all current illicit 
drug users report that marijuana is 
the only illegal drug they have 
used; this figure rises to 77 percent 
if hashish (a more concentrated 
form of marijuana) is included. 
• Millions of Americans use mari-
juana; few abuse it. 
• If you are being pulled over for a 
routine traffic stop and the cop 
asks to search your car, you can say 
no. Without probable cause, law 
enforcement needs a s.earch war-
rant to search your car with out 
your consent. 
• Marijuana smokers in this coun-
try are no different from their non-
smoking peers, except for their 
marijuana use.

Good teachers are the difference

The UCSD men's lacrosse 
team has dramatically turned 
around its play after last year's 
debacle. 

The prt'vious year's record in 
the Western Collegiate Lacrosse 
League: 0-6. 

This year: 5-1 . Also, UCSD 
captured a share of the WCLL 
Divis ion A South. title with its 
12-7 win Saturday over Loyola 
Marymounr University. 

It was all UCSD in th)': first 
quaner, with Jutjcn Westra and 
Jared Crabtree notching goals 
for a 2-0 UCSD lead. The 
advantage could have been 
much greater, but four UCSD 
shots came just short, and LMU 
goalie Peter Campbell made 
some nice saves. 

[h the second quarter, LMU's 
Mark Schoelkopf turned things 
around, scoring four goals to 
give his tcam a 6-3 lead heading 
into halftime. 

UCSD bounced back ill the 
third quarter with Crabtree and 
Ben HulJey scoriJ1g a goal each 
to lllake the score 6-5. 

LMU added two more goals, 
but thcn UCSD went on a 
sevcn-goai run to fmish the con-
ICSt. 

Mike Hunter was clearly 
UCSD's most valuable player 
after knocking in four goals and 
assisting on two during the final, 
dccisive quarter. 

UCSD goalie Jason Lowen-

stein made sure that LMU would 
not pose much of a threat by 
making 17 saves. -

Next up for UCSD are the 
WCLL quarterfinals against the 
University of Arizona. The twO 
tea ms are familiar with each 

~ther, UCSD having grabbed a 
14-13 win earlier this year.

TEAM 

The UCSD badminton team, 
currently in its first year of exjs~ 
tence, is doing just fine after a 6-

Willi eight matches down and 
two to go, and the score tied at 
four, UCSD's Keri Leong and 
Norreen Joe stepped up to the 
challenge. winning their doubles 
match. Singles star Stella Ly 
added a singles win and VCSD 
won the match.

The Tritons knew that the 
Santa Cruz match would be diffi-

Tritons' old rivals from Division III 
and usually got the better of 
UCSD. The same was true this 
time around: The Tritons gave it

match by winning two tie-breakers 
7-6,2-6,7-6 at No.2 singles. 

On a losing streak and licking 
their wounds. the Tritons headed 
into their match against Sonoma 
State on Monday. hoping to end 
their road trip on a winning streak. 
They did just that with a 6-3 victO-
ry that got their record back to 8-8 
for the year. 

In doubles. the Tritons were vic-
torious in twO of the three prosets 
and were very close to sweeping. At 
No. 1 doubles. Cory Moderhak and 
Wilson took their match to 7-7 
before losing 9-7 against Sonoma's 
strongest team. Meyer and Chopra 

finished off their 
but ended up with 
a 2-5 loss. 

The highlights 
for the Tritons 
came at No. 2 
doubles and NO.3 
singles. At No. 2 
doubles. Mike 
Meyer and 
Sameer Chopra

Dan Albrecht

to put the hun to 
Sonoma's team of 
Kevin Harrigan and

In singles. the 
Tritons were equal-

ning four of the six 
matches. Chopra 

took out his opponent in three sets. 
After losing the first set 2-6. Wilson 
rallied to win the next two 6-4. 6-1 . 

Davis was another match that 
the Tritons would have to play 
inspired tennis to win . The Aggies 
are clearly the best of the Califor-
nia Collegiate Athletic Associa-
tion this year and showed it with 
their 6-3 victory over UCSD. 
Again. Meyer and Chopra were 
solid in doubles as they thor-
ough ly dismantled their oppo-
nents 8-1 at No.2. Unfortunately. 
that was the only doubll:s match 
the Tritons won. 

In singles, Wilson again won a

Schroeter finished off his perfect

The Tritons have only one 
more match - an away match at 
point Loma Nazarene - before 
they go into CM Division II 
regionals on the weekend of May

there. UCSD could move on to

Good luck. Tritons.

closed out the seven-inning 
game. 

Bedar and Sereno gave up just 
two ~uns in six innings. Kevin 
Waldll1ger pitched the ·entire 
game for the Broncos. giving up 
three runs in the process. The 
game came down to the bottom 
of the seventh, with the Tritons 
ahead 3-2. Dramatically, the

is the best way to spend those last 
waning hours of sunlight. getting 
your grub on and preparing for 
the night's festivities, whatever 
they may be. 

On Friday. some cohorts and I 
congregated at the Cage for an 
afternoon's worth of dead animal 
cooking and consuming. An icy 
tun of Diet Coors rounded out the 
menu and gave us ample invigora-
tion and substance for the ball-
game later on. -

You see, following an after-
noon of baking on the beach and 
cooking in the front yard, there is 
nothing like an evening at the 
ballpark - especially if you make 
a mission of it by going all -out to 
rouse the crowd and make a 
complete fool of yourself in the 
process. 

Such was the case on Friday 
eve. We took to the stands, about 
30 strong, full of team spirit ~ nd 
distilled spirits and ready to spec-
tate. Our scrappy Padres were pre-
pared to stomp the hated Dodgers 
- their spoiled, whiny rivals from 
up North - and we were ready to 
take it all in. . 

Then there was Neil. Neil Den-
nis to be exact, and we were armed 
with a thick stack of his beloved, 
mullet- flossing mug, ready to 
spread the sweet word of this 
charism'atic iconoclast. As soon as 
we produced the full-sized pic-
tures of the sassy. sullen-eyed sul-
tan and held them aloft for all to 
see, a hush befell the packed 
crowd as everyone in our immedi-
ate area tumed from the on-field 
action to appreciate N.D.'s 
prowess. 

No sooner did the silence fall 
than it was broken; the tranquillity 
shattered by the thrilling chant 
emanating in unison from the 
Qualcomm crowd, NE-ILI, NE-
ILl, NE-IL! People swarmed in 
from all around - young, old, 
white, black, Dodger fan, Padre fan 
- it didn't matter as all let their 
differences melt away and united 
under the omniscient eyes of our 
icon. Little children paraded 
around with Neil's face tucked up 
under their ball caps and elder 
women waved him fervently above 
their heads. The air was thick with 
the most joyous of laughter. It was 
beautiful. 

game 4-3 . 
The Tritons pounded the 

Unversity of Redlands, 10-2, at Tri-
ton Baseball Field on Tuesday and 
snapped their four-game losing 
streak. The Tritons scored all of 
their runs in the first thre~ innings. 
They scored five runs on four hits 
in the third inning and were helped 
by two errors by the visiting team. 
Addison went 3-for-5 with a dou-
ble and a stolen base. The win 
boosted their record to 11 -27 
overall. 

UC Davis is the next opponent 
for the men 's baseball team. The 
Tritons will play the Aggies Friday

Lounge 

S pring quarter is a boon to those whose partying tends to linger in the 
realm of heartiness, and whose 
souls can only be salved by cool, 
rum-tinged drinks, barbecued 
meats and the soothing rhythms of 
a fully pumped-up stereo. Spring is 
rife with opportunities to indulge 
in the varied spectrum of joyous 
daHiance. 

Here at UCSD, one's spring-
time thoughts tend to wander to 
that revered, bejeweled institution 
that is the Sun God Festi va l, a day 
(or week, for the foolhardy) full of 
fun , friends and fine, frosty refres-
cos. With good planning and a 
proclivity for self-destructive 
behavior, one ca n fit a liver 's 
worth of partyi ng into a sca nt 24 
hours. 

Personally, I plan to rise o efor 
the first hint of light appears on the 
horizon, don my drafting gear and 
head out to the traditional haunt: a 
tavern that cannot be named in 
these pages, but possesses such 
mythical characteris tics that it has 
traditionally drawn me and a group 
of associates for a bout of eye-
opl'nlllg \/nblbery before the day's 
big dance. 

An oh-so-early commencing 
hour, hot nuts on the wall and 
liquid breakfas t drink spec ials 
make thiS joint the toas t of the 
town . It even used to house an air 
hockey table! Even without the 
greatest of all bar games, the place 
retains its cantankerous, com-
pelling atmosphere and ensures 
that anyone who enters its hal-
lowed halls will leave a bit WI~er, a 
bit more enlightened and a bit 
more drunk. 

Anything that follows a pro-
longed session here will be so anti-
climactic that it almost won't mat-
ter and you probably won't 
remember it anyway. 

The Sun God experience is only 
a piece of the warm, sumptuous pie 
that is springtime here in Sa n 
Diego. 

The sun-dappled coastline just 
beyond the UCSD ca mp'Js 
boundary is where you shou ld be 
spending most of your quarter. 
Class is fun and might be of some 
use once you graduate, but you'll 
be happier spending your balmy, 
wistfu l afternoons lying prostrate 
in the sa nd, blissfully napping 
(passed out), after five or 12 beers 
of your choice. 

This approach will reap far 
more benefits than your typical 
lecture or almost anything else 
you might be doing. So next time 
you are pondering your Tuesday 
afternoo n schedule, bypass th e 
books for a Beck's and head for 
the coast. 

Sunny days at the beach often 
lead smack dab into the middle of 
that traditional beach side endeav-
or: the barbecue. After an intense 
daylong drinking binge, nothing is 
as rejuvenating as a nice, juicy

Tritons Down· Redlands 10-2 
Win stops bleeding after four-game losing streak 
By ARVIND VASAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's baseball 
team's grueling schedule contin-
ued as it recently played five 
"games in six days, four at its 
home field. 

UCSD hosted Cal Poly 
Pomona on Thursday. Pomona 
had a record of 19-17 coming 
into the ga me. The Tritons 
jumped out to a 7-1 lead in the 
third inning, with Chad Addison 
and Chris Tallman each driving 
in two runs. The Tritons led the 
game 7-2 going into the seventh 
inning. 

The game turned around as 
Cal Poly ra llied in the seventh 
in ning, scoring 8 runs to take a 
10-7 lead. The Tritons scored 
once in the eighth, but Cal Poly 
held on to win 11 -8 . 

Addison was the bright spot 
for the Tritons, going 5-for-6 
with 3 RBIs. 

The teams played again on 
April 13. Cal Poly came out 
swinging in the first, scoring two 
runs off John Beaven, including 
a home run by power hitter 
Justin Davis. 

UCSD managed only two 
runs in the entire game, one 
fro m a solo home run by junior 
Ryan Larson in the fourth 
inning. The game ended in a 4-2 
loss for the Tritons. 

The teams met again for a 
doubleheader April 14, this time 
at Pomona, where th ings got 
even worse for UCSD. 

In the first game, Pomona ace 
Steve Kaustinen gave up eight 
hits and one rur. to improve his 
record to 4-3. 

UCSD's Andy Hanau could-
n't handle Pomona's attack, as 
Pomona piled up 10 runs in 
eigh t innings. Pomona third 
baseman Gregor Connors belted 
his fifth home run of the season 
and the team combined for 10 
hits.

Travels. 
UCSD goes on a 
tour, wins one 
and loses two 
By BILL BURGER 
Senior Staff Writer 

When most of us think of a 
weekend road trip, we think of 
heading to Las Vegas or maybe Palm 
Springs, Calif. The Triton men's ten-
nis team, however, had a much dif-
ferent sort of road trip last weekend. 

On Friday, the Tri tons traveled 
to UC Santa Cruz to take on the 
Banana Slugs. From there, they 
moved north to battle with their 
league foes, the UC Davis Aggies. 
For good measure, they went to 
Sonoma, Calif. on Monday for a 
confrontation with Sonoma State 
University.

UCSD Golf 
Wraps up 
2001 Season 
There is sti II hope 
for future individ-
ual success 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD golf team played its 
final tournament of the year in the 
District Eight Qualifier at Butte 
Creek Country Club in Chico, 
Calif. 

The Tritons finish ed sixth out 
of nine teams with a three-round 
score of 938. 

The top school overall was Cal-
ifornia State University Stanislaus, 
which stroked an 883. 

Darrin Sulivan was the top Tri-
ton, scoring a 229 for 14th place. 
Ben Page- placed 25th with a 234 
and Matt Howe took 32nd with a 
239. Rounding out the top UCSD 
five were Greg Wilson with a 241 
for 35th and Lenny Lanford with a 
246 for 40th. 

"All the teams played pretty 
badly; said UCSD head coach 
Mike Wydra. "[Butl there are some 
fantastic players." 

This was UCSD's first year in 
Division" and the team realized 
the course and the competition are 
tough. 

"We played nothing but tour-
naments," Wydra said. "Clubs try 
their best to make courses tough . 
They don't want to look bad." 

Though the Tritons are ranked 
20th in the nation , they will not 
play at the quarterfinals in Spring-
field, Mo. in May. Five of the best 
schools in the nation are out West 
in District Eight, but only four are 
chosen from each region to go to 
the quarterfinals. UCSD will be the 
odd team out. 

There is still hope that UCSD 
will send a few individual stars if 
Howe and Sulivan are selected te 
compete.
