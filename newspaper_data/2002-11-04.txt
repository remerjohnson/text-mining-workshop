The University Council-
American Federation of Teachers 
and the Coalition of University 
Employees both rejected the most 
recent contract offers made by the 
University of Ca lifornia in 
October. 

Both unions said the universi -
ty's proposals did not address any 
of their primary demands, and as a 
result, eac h will respond with 
counterproposals. 

C. U. E., which represents 

18,000 UC clerical workers, 
rejected the university's ct. 10 
settlement proposal on the Oct. 
31 deadline that would have given 
the union a 2 percent sa lary 
increase, fo llowed by a 1.5 per-
cent cost of living increase there-
after. The union conti nues to ask 
for a 15 percent salary pay 
increase to bring its wages on par 
with what it says comparable 
workers make in the private sec-
tor. 

The university said its offer 
was on the arne level of salary 
increases that other staff employ-

ees are receiving. 
UC-AFT, which rc prest:lH~ 

about 4,000 UC lecm rers, reject-
ed an Oct. 23 proposal by the uni-
versity, ca lling the proposal a 
"take it or leave it" o ffer III an 
Oct. 30 statement and aid It 
failed to add ress their main 
demands. 

In the offer, which the univer-
sity valued at $10 million to $ 12 
million ove r the next three years, 
the salary mllllmUIl1S for pre-slx-
year lecturers was set at $3- ,R68

"Adam" costume deemed inappropriate by police 
By DANA WEST 
Senior Staff Writer 

Warren student council 
passes a resolution for RAs 

Resolution cans for a fonnal 
process of conducting investigations 

The annual UCSD Bookstore 
H alloween Costume Contest took 
place as planned in the Price 
Center on Oct. 31, with one con-
testant being escorted off the 
premises by campus police. 
Jonathan Mariano, a UCSD stu-
dent, entered the cosnlme contest 
as the biblical figure Adam wear-
ing no clothing and holding only 
an apple in his hand. 

ByEDWU 
Senior Staff Writer 

The Warren College Student 
Council passed a resolution Oct. 27 
calling upon Warren Residential 
Life to "establish a formal process 
through which allegations of RA or 
intern misconduct shall be evaluat-
ed ." The resolution was in 
response to the office's October 
dismissal of seven Earl Warren 
College resident advisers and one 
intern. 

The RAs were fired for alleged-
ly violating residential life policy by 
attending a Sept. 6 Black Hall party 
where alcohol was served to 
minors. 

While the resolution makes no 
objection to disciplinary action lev-
eled against the eight students, it 
does call into question the process 
by which the Warren Residential 
Life office investigated the allega-
tions. The resolution also mentions 
the lack of an adequate appeals 
process and the amount of time the 
fired students were given between 
notice and eviction from their on-
campus housing. 

The resolution cites "individual 
interrogations," the uncertainty of 
the accused as to the nature of the 
allegations and the lack of a stated 

appeals process as problems con-
tributing to "tension and hostility 
that currently permeates Warren 
college because of this incident." 

However, at an Oct. 9 meeting 
of the Warren College Student 
Council, representatives of Warren 
Residential Life maintained that 
they had consulted with campus 
labor relations and had carefully 
followed all relevant labor, confi -
dentiality and due-process codes in 
their construction and execution of 
the dismissal process. 

The Warren residential life rep-
resentatives maintained that the 
RAs, being contracted rather than

"I wanted to be something 
really different," Mariano said. "I 
was kind of looking around my 
house the night before and all 1 
had was a bunch of apples, so 1 
thought, 'apples, apples 
Adam.'" 

Mariano said he decided to dis-
pense with the traditional image 
of Adam with a fig leaf covering 
his genitals. 

"In reality that was only 
human intervention," Mariano 
said. "Ideally, I was to come up 
on stage in full nudity, proud and 
naive. I would take a bite from 
the apple, let its effects take over, 
and be overcome with embar-

Mariano never got the chance 

to perform his act. A bystander 
phoned the UCSD police to 
report his costume as offensive. 

Cliff McEnery, a junior at 
Thurgood Marshall College, said 
he felt Mariano's actions did not 
warrant a police response. 

"Why is it such a big dea!?" 
McEnery said . "None of the stu-
dents cared. He wasn't offending 
anyone; he was just sta nding 
there. He wasn 't smiling, he was-
n't acting mischievous." 

Mariano echoed McEnery's 
feelings. 

"I don't think it was indecent 
exposure; I wasn't acting sexual," 
Mariano said. "As long as it does 
no harm to anyone physically, we 
should be able to dress up ... as 
whoever .. . we want to be on 

Halloween. " 
California Penal ode 31-1 

defines indecent exposure as, 
"Every person who willfully and 
lewdly ... exposes his person, or 
the private parts thereof, in any 
public place , or in any place 
where there are present other 
persons to be offended or 
annoyed ." 

The law tates that violation of 
code 314 is punishable as a rn i de-
meanor. 

Mariano was not arre ted, but 
he was asked to put his clothes 
back on in the restroom and was 
then escorted to the cam pus 
police station so that the police 
could obtain his identification 
information and campus affilia-
tion. 

Campus police were unavail -
able for comment.

BRIEFLY ETCETERA ••• 
Study shows Summer 

Bridge prepares freshman 
A recent study conducted by UCSD 

resea rcher Patrick Velasquez concluded that 
UCSD's Summer Bridge Program, which is 
designed to successfully transition incoming 
freshmen and to help them develop leader-
ship skills and provide participating students 
with important academic, social and cognitive 
skills that last throughout their freshman year. 

Velasquez, who is the director of 
UCSD's Office of Academic Support and 
Instructional Services, used the experi-
ences of 10 UCSD students of color who 
participated in the program in 1998 to 
prove that programs like the four-week 
Summer Bridge Program help "bridge the 
gap" to college adjustment for many tal-
ented and high-achieving underrepresent-
ed students. 

According to Velasquez, past research 
has shown that students' "ease of transi-
tion" to college life, especially their academ-
ic and social adjustment during freshman 
year, IS critical to their success in college. 
The students who participated in the study 
said that they formed diverse, close net-
works of peers during program sessions, 
which contributed to their social interaction 
on campus. 

Velasquez will present his findings at the 
University of Nebraska's annual conference 
"Recruitment and Retention of Students, 
Faculty and Staff of Color," which will be 
held in Li ncoln, Neb., on Nov. 6. 

UCSD included in C;CRC's 
nationwide research effort 

A $10.9 million grant from the National 
Center for Research Resources was award-
ed to the joint General Clinical Research 
Center of UCSD and UC Irvine to conduct 
research on schizophrenia. 

With the grant, the GCRC will coordinate 
10 research sites nationwide in an effort to 
link and sha re vast amounts of computer-
ized data from brain images of people who 
have schizophrenia. In addition, researchers 
participating in the project will create stan-
dardi zed, powerful discovery tools for 
futu re brain studies in large populations. 

The newly funded project will utilize a 
nationally linked, high-speed computer net-

Progesterone found safer 
than replacements 

Excessive bleeding, a troublesome side-
effect that causes many women to stop tak-
ing hormone replacement therapies, is less 
likely with progesterone than with more 
commonly used synthetic versions, accord-
ing to UCSD researchers. 

The most widely used HRT is estrogen 
plus medroxyprogesterone acetate, which 
was recently discovered to increase the risk 
of breast cancer, heart attack and stroke in a 
national Women's Health In itiative study. A 
combination of estrogen and micronized 
progesterone, however, was found to cause 
fewer days and less intense bleedin& as 
well as fewer health risks, than the most 
commonly used version. 

The new report comes from a 
Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin 
Interventions trial that studied 875 women 
over a three-year period at seven sites in 
the United States. The participants took 
either a placebo, estrogen alone, estrogen 
plus a continuous form of MPA, estrogen 
plus a cyclical form of MPA, or estrogen plus 
a cyclical form of MP. 

The study was authored by Robert D. 
Langer, professor of fam ily and preventive 
medicine at the UCSD School of Medicine, 
as well as Etta A. Lindenfeld, a UCSD assis-
tant clinical professor of psychiatry. The 
results of the study appear in the November 
issue of the Journal of Obstetrics and 
Gynecology.

that the RAs served entirely at the discretion

Labor: Unions say issues are not addressed 
continued from page I 

and at $40,200 for post-six year 
lecturers for this year. In the pro-
posal, both minimums would rise 
by about 4 percent (he following 
year. 

Most UC lecturers.work for an 
initial six-year probationary period. 
After this period, the university can 
choose whether to offer the lectur-
er a three-year renewable contract. 
UC-AFT maintains the renewal 
system is tOO arbitrary and does not 
provide job security. 

A brief Nov. I statement by the 
U Ili versity of Cali fo rnia said the 
university was "disappointed" by 
UC-AFT's rejection and is open to 
meeting with the union and hear-
ing counter proposals. The state-
ment also said that "the substance 
of what the union offers and just 
how much they're willing to com-
promise will determine a great deal 
in terms of where we go from 
here." 

UC-AFT said the latest offer 
fai led to address any of its primary 
concerns, primarily enhanced job 

security and a merit-based sa lary 
scale. 

Fred Lonidier, president of 
Local 2034 UC-AIT and a pro-
fessor of visual arts at UCSD, said 
hi s union will file an unfair labor 
practices charge against the uni-

" Narmally when you say 
'good faith,' you came 

back and bargain. " 
- Freel Lonidier, President of 

Local 2034 UC-AFT 

versity. 
"Normally when you say 'good 

faith,' you come back and bargain," 
Lonidier said. 

He and his union maintain that 
the University of California's latest 
offer was not a bona fide effort at 
negotiations. 

"They never [bargained] . 
They've never said no; they've cer-
tainly never said yes," Lonidier 
said. "That means they're not bar-
gaining. You can't JUSt not address 
it. " 

Lonidier said if negotiations 
continue to be fruitless for both 
parties, the university or union 
could decla re an impasse in the 
proceedings that will trigger a 
fact-finding investigation by the 
Public Employee Relations 
Boa rd. 

Following the investiga tion, 
the State Mediation and 
Conciliation Service of the 
Department of Industrial 
Relations is contacted to assign a 
mediator. If the two parties are 
still unabl e to reach an agreement, 
either party may request the 
implementation of statutory fact-
finding procedures. 

C.U.E. has been in contract 
negotiations with the University of 
California for over a year and a 
half, and UC-AFT has been in 
negotiations for nearly two years . 

RAs: Town hall meeting is in the works 
continued (rom page 2 

"The new resolution is a bit 
more concise, with less hostility," 
said Warren College Junior 
Senator Jessica Kepford. 

The Warren Council also called 
upon "Warren Student Affairs and 
Residential Life deans, current and 
former RAs, and all other interest-
ed persons" to hold an open forum 
to "encourage dialogue." Vlhile the 

forum had originally been planned 
for Nov. 4, it has been postponed 
to allow for the parties involved to 
set an agenda for discussion. 

"The Town Hall meeting is in 
the works, and we hope that all col-
leges - both staff and students -
will participate," Lee said. "We 
hope that out of the town ha 11 
meeting will come more educated 
public dialogue about the status 

and rights of student residential life 
staff." 

There was no immedi ate 
response to the resolution by the 
Warren Residential Life office. 
The office did, however, send out 
an Oct. II lener to Warren resi-
dents, and the remaining Warren 
RAs have been holding informal 
meetings to help residents adapt to 
the absence of their former RAs.

State Elections 

GOVERNOR 
GRAY DAVIS 

The race for California's governor is 
arguably the most disappointing that this 
state has seen in many years. Gov. Gray 
Davis has been criticized by both republi-
cans and democrats during his last term. He 
has been blamed for the energy crisis, unem-
ployment, access to quality health care, a 
possible water shortage and California's low 
education ranking. Even so, Davis did what 
he could with an incredibly tough term in 
office, and he remains the best candidate on 
the ballot. The other candidates lack the 
political experience and savvy needed to run 
the fifth-largest economy in the world. With 
that in mind, the Guardian endorses Davis in

ties for this race - Davis stands

only because of her experience 
as representative for the 42nd 
District, but also for her com-
mitment to a fa r more moderate 
set of political prac tices. 

Davi s' opponent , 
Va nDeWcghe, seems to be littl e 
more than just a box for the 
Republican Party. His stance on 
everything lines up precise ly 
along party lines, never devia t-

list of his laughable obiectives is 
his support for national missile 
defense, including a space-based 
program, which harkens back to 
the old Star Wars argument. 

Davis has worked in San 
Diego for years and knows the 
needs of the city. She has been 
supportive of our despera te 
need for more public trans-
portation , and has addressed 
the need for more afforda bl e 
housing. In general, Davis is 
better prepared to deal with a 
wide breadth of issues, as 
opposed to her opponent, who 
has focused much of his plat-

Davis continues to offer voters 
of any party the opportunity to 
be heard and well-represented,

50TH 
DISTRICT 

DEL STEWART 
Del Stewart is a moderate 

democrat who supports cam-
paign finance reform, the 
implementation of a voluntary 
national ID card program and 
abortion rights. 

He has innovative ideas, 
such as programming all elec-
tronic cash registers to round 
up every transaction to the 
next nickel , thus eliminating 
the need for pennies. The 
pennies from these countless 

transactions would be donated 
to chari ty, generating over $10 
bi ll ion per year. Stewart sup-
ports the welfare reform 
e nacted under th e C li nton 
administration, and also <ldvo-
ca tes fur ther reform. He 
thinks Medicaid (UMedi-Cal" 
in California) is too expenSive, 
and needs to oe fully 
reformed. . 

Stewart founded a small 
San Diego business, so he's 
familiar wi th the San Diego 
Jrea and It economic needs. 
His c:mlpaign donations are 
placed in a "bli nd trust," 
which preve ms him from 
becoming beholden to special 
interest grou ps. 

Stewart 's opponent, repub-
lica n incumbent Randy 
"Duke" Cunningham, hasn't 
even bothered to run a serious 
campaign. 

He rarely rerurns to San 
Diego to make appearances in 
his home district, presumably 
relying upon the power of his 
incumbency to keep himself in 
office. 

Stewart's moderate views 
and lack of partisan zeal make 
him an ideal choice for both 
democrat and republican vot-
ers. The Guardian therefore 
endorses Stewart for the 50th 
Congressional District.

6 OPINION 

PROPOSITION 46 

Affurda ble housing is a major concern, 
not only for students, but also for those 
who can't afford a home of thei r own, given 
California's high COSt of living. \Vith rising 
housing prices and continual population 
increases, Proposition 46 provides a good 
way to help provide low-cost housing to 
those who need it most. 

By all owi ng 
the state to sell 
$2 .1 billion in 
bo n ds , 
Proposi tio n 46 
would relieve 
some of the major 
housing and 
homeless prob-
lems that remai n 
u n so l ve d 
throughout the 
state. Over half of 
the bond funds 
would l>e allocat-

Emergency 
Housing 

YES 
ed into low- interest loans for local govern-
ments, developers and nonprofi t organiza-
(lOllS to fund part of their c nstruction 
cust. 

1 n reUlrn, a portion of the development 
lI1ust be set aside for low-income house-
holds. By offsetti ng some of the costs 
toward the construction of housing, devel-
opers ca n afford to reduce the rent and/or 
costs to the consumers. This allows some 
level of housing affordability to the public. 
Proposition 46 also proves to be beneficial 
for college students: some $15 mi ll ion will 
be earmarked for low-interest loans for 
housing near state universities. These lmits 
would be reserved for low-income Stu-
dents. 

llle proposition would also allocate 
additional funding to low-interest loans for 
first-time low- and middle-income home-
buyers. Additional funding would be set 
aside by allocating grants for the develop-
ment of homeless shelters. 

Proposition 46 also targets cerrain criti-
cal segments of the population - teachers, 
policeman and firefighters - who might 
need financial assistance in purchasing a 
new home. 

For students and families just starting 
Out, Proposition 46 is a blessing that will 
give them the opportunity to find afford-
able housing. 

For battered women, low-income fami-
lies, seniors and the homeless, Proposition 
46 offers a chance to stay under a roof 
instead of on the streets. 

PROPOSITION 47 

By voting "yes" on Proposition 47, 
California voters will invest in the states 
future by providing financial security to 
both K-12 schools and higher education in 
a period of economic uncertainty. 
Proposition 47 is the largest bond measure 
ever to be placed on the C alifornia ballot, 
and the intention of its authors is to address 
an overcrowding problem in our schools 
that requires 
immediate atten-
tion . Consider 
that one in three 
California school -
children sits in a 
classroom that is 
over c rowded 
and/or needs sig-
nificant improve-
ments due to old 
and outdated 
facilities. 

The crisis of 
overcrowding in 
California public 

School 
Construction 

YES 
schools has been well-documented. In the 
next five years, the number of schoolchild-
ren in the state is projected to increase 
from 6.1 million to well over 7 million. 
Anal ysts estimate that an additional 300 
schools and 46,000 classrooms will be 
needed ro accommodate the overwhelming 
population. 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

2002 ELECTION (~l J IDI 

State Propositions 
While the bulk of this $1 3 billion bond 

measure would be allocated to the state's 
K- 12 schools, the successful passage of 
Proposition 47 would pour more than $400 
million into the UC system. Money raised 
by the bond will all ocate $57 million to 
UCSD projects alone. 

The School of Pharmacy will be grant-
ed $24.7 million for the construction of a 
new facility, whi le more than .$16 million 
will be allocated toward the renovation of 
the biomedical library of the School of 
Medicine. About $15 million will be spent 
on other UCSD projects. 

There is no doubt that the largest bond 
measure in the state's hisrory wi ll place a 
financial burden on the state's citizens. If 
paid off in 30 years, the State Deparonent 
estimates that Proposition 47 will end up 
costing Californi a taxpayers more than 
$26.2 billion, including interest, at an 
expense of about $873 million per year. 

The tax hike is worth the insurance that 
students have decent classrooms that are 
not overflowing with classmates . The 
GlIordian encourages voters to vote "yes" 
on Proposition 47 to guaranree the quality 
of educational and research facilities in our 
state. 

PROPOSITION 48 

VVhile no statewid e melees will result 
from the issue at hand in Proposition 48, it 
is still an important proposal on the ballot. 
This proposition is the follow-up to previ-
ous legislation, 1998's Proposition 220, 
which consolidated the muni cipal trial 
courts with the superior courts. 
Proposition 48 
deletes all refer-
ences in the 
California 
Constitution to 
municipal courts. 
The Guardian 
urges voters to 
pass this proposi-
tion. 

The bottom 
line is that it elim-
inates language in 
the constitution 
that is now obso-
lete. The issue is 

Constitution 
Update 
YES 

not whether we should consolidate the 
courts - that has already been decided. 
The issue is whether or not we should 
delete the language referring to the munic-
ipal courts. The answer is yes. 

Opponents to the bill say that it would 
make it harder for Californians to re-estab-
Iish a municipal court system. But the fact 
is, if Californians wanted to re-establish the 
municipal courts, it could simply rewrite 
the provisions back into the constitution, 
along with the particulars of recreating the 
court system in another proposition. There 
is no reason to keep the outdated language 
in the constitution at this time. 

This proposition will cost nothing to 
voters. It simply trims the fat. It passed 
without opposition in both the state assem-
bly and state senate. There is no reason 
why it shouldn't do the same in the elec-
tion. 

PROPOSITION 49 

Proposition 49 wou ld increase state 
funding for after-school programs, briving 
priority to schools with low-i ncome stu-
dents and schools that <II ready have after-
school programs in place. The Gum'dian 
believes that this proposition is worthy of 
support. 

With the number of si ngle-parent 
households and households in which both 
parents work during tile duy increasing, 
young people need constructive supervision 
when school lets out. This initiative would 
provide grants from $50,000 to $75,000 for 
schools that want to create or increase edu-
cational after-school programs - dollars 
that will directly benefit California's chil-
dren s education and well-being. 

The increase of funding to after-school 
programs wi ll also help California in that it 
may prevent young people from getting 
into trouble. Students who are in a struc-
nlred, supervised environment after school 
and who are occupied in the evening are 
less likely to be 
involved in crime. 
This would then 
save Ca li fornia's 
juvenile court and 
detention system 
thousands of dol-
lars every year. 

Critics of 
Proposition 49 
point out that the 
specified funding 
is guaranteed in 
California's 
spending, reduc-
ing legislators' 

After-School 
Funding 

YES 
flexibility in budget crunch times. 
However, guaranteeing funding for after-
school programs would show how impor-
tant such programs are. Children deserve 
educational after-school programs regard-
less of the vagaries of California's economy. 

The Gullt'dian asks voters to vote "yes" 
on Proposition 49. 

PROPOSITION 50 

On the surface, Proposition 50 appears 
to be a great piece oflegislation. It promis-
es to clean up water and make it safe for our 
children's children to have a glass of tap 
water. However, the proposition spends 
too much time and money on extraneous 
things not central to providing us with a 
sustainable solution to the problem of 
water pollution and lack of water in 
California. The GUllrdian urges you to vote 
against Proposition SO. 

The proposition proposes the sale of 
$3.44 billion in 
general obligation 
bonds that would 
end up costing 
Californians $6.9 
billion over the 
next 30 y~rs in 
principal and 
interest. In an era 
of enormous debt 
and budget deficit, 
voters need to 
make tough deci-
sions about where 
their money is 
going. There is 

Water 
Cleanup 

NO 
simply too much fat on this proposal to 
make it a viable option for California under 
its current economic restraints. 

While this bill provides for the cleaning 
of current water sources as a main compo-
nent, the Guardian feels that the bulk of 
that money should go to sustainable water 
programs such as the desalination of ocean 
water, which is something that could pro-
vide unprecedented levels of available, 
affordable drinlcing water if perfected. Ths 
proposition provides for that, but not in 
sufficient ways. It spends too much money 
trying to clean up existing water. 

Another downfall of this bill is its fis-
cal impact. Nevermind the $6.9 billion 
that the budget would have to account 
for, but the impact to local communities 
could be devastating. Part of the bill 
allows for the government to acquire 
land for government and .nonprofit usC} 
to monitor environmental protection. 
What this would also do is reduce the 
local property taxes generated by the 
community, since most government and 

nonpro~lt property is tax-exempt. This 
could reduce revenue by up to $10 mil-
lion, which would mean that less money 
would get back to the community. Since 
the state is required to refund local gov-
ernments for any tax revenue losses 
e:tperienced by schools, California 
would have to subsidize an estimated 
half of the lost revenue, or about $5 mil-
lion. This would still leave many local 
programs without their revenue from 
the state, causing many of them to shut 
down. 

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 2002 

PROPOSITION 51 

A "yes" vote for Proposition 5 1 will 
allevia te transportation congestion and 
improve publ ic transportation for all 
Californians without raising taxes. 

The measure transfers 30 percent of the 
existing sales tax revenues from the 
Department of Motor Vehicles to a specific 
transportation fund. Thli! newly allocated 
money would be used to sponsor a wide 
range of transportation improvements, 
including upgrades to our mass transit and 
highway systems, and replacements of 
school buses. The measure also identifies 45 
special transportation and environmental 
projects that would receive a total of about 
$210 million in 
2003-04, decreas-
ing over time. 

Opponents to 
the proposition 
allege that it 
would instigate 
corruption, citing 
numerous cam-
paign contribu-
tions from devel-
opers to influence 
the specific list of 
projects mandat-

Transportation 
Funding 

YES 
ed under the proposition. These opponents 
also claim that the proposition would con-
strain the state legislarure when faced with 
state crises, since the money allocated under 
the proposition cannot be transferred. 

However, the Guardian does not find 
merit in these allegations because the cur-
rent congestion problems that plague all 
California residents warrant that something 
be done to alleviate our transportation 
woes. Currently, less than 1 percent of state 
sales t2X revenue is set aside for transporta-
tion improvements. Under Proposition 51, 
4.5 percent of the sales t2X revenue would 
be allocated exclusively for transportation. 

Voting "yes" on Proposition 51 will 
ensure that transportation and safety con-
cerns are addressed at last. The GrlllT'lJian 
encourages voters to support Proposition 
51, the passage of which will ensure the 
safety of our not -so-safe roads. 

PROPOSITION S2 

Under current state laws, any 
California citi7~n who wishes to register 
to vote must do so 15 days before the elec-
tion. Proposition 52 allows voters to reg-
ister on the the actual election day, with 
proof of residence, at any polling location. 
Ths would enable more citizens to vote 
and would counter steadily declining 
voter tumout. 

To prevent possible voter fraud that 
might arise from the extension of the voter 
registration date, 
Proposition 52 also 

incr~ses penalties 
for voter fraud and 
criminalizes con-
spiracy to commit 
voter fraud. 

By allowing cit-
izens to register up 
to the election day, 
students who have 
recently moved 
will still be able to 

Voter 
Registration 

YES 
register in time, as long as they have iden-
tification. Furthermore, eliminating the 
need to register 15 days before the election 
date removes one of the hassles of being a 
college student: the constant moving 
around that necessitates repealed voter 
registrations. 

The process to verify California resi-
dence is simple. The only requirement to 
register at the polling booths would be a 
valid California drivers license or two doc-
uments (i .e. banlc statement, credit card 
bill, utility bill) that identify both the name 
and current address of the citizen. 

Proposition 52 is especially helpful in 
easing the process for students to vote and 
would be a way to incrCllsc voter turnout by 
eliminating many of the barriers that cur-
rently hamper students from voting.

Both Zucchet's experience 
on the Pacific Beach Town

well-equipped to serve that 
district's unique needs. In addi-
tion, he has also worked with 
City Hall as a member of the 
Select Committee on 
Government Efficiency and 
Fiscal Reform. 

His platform is centered on 
preventing beach pollution and 
protecting the Mission Bay 30-
foot height limit, making 
neighborhood services such as 
libraries and infrastructure a 
top budget priority, and mak-
ing the city run more efficient-
ly and ethically. 

All of these issues are 
important in a city whose most 
valuable resource is its coast-
line and where public services 
have often been less important 
than ticket guarantees and 
closed-door deals with devel-
opers. 

Zucchet is endorsed by the

2002 ELECTION GU I DE 

DISTRICT ATTORN EY 

BONNIE DUMANIS 
The Gum'dian endor e Bonnie 

Dumanis as the district attorney of San 
Diego County because of both her merit as 
a candidate a nd because she would restore 
order and integrity to an office that has 
been marred by scandal during the term 
servcd by her opponent, incumbent Paul 
Pfingst. 

Pfingst has been criticized for his 
incompetence and unethical behavior while 
serving as district attorney. His administra-
tion botched the Stephanie Crowe murder 
case when authorities jailed three boys for 
six months, only to release the children 
after DNA evidence later pointed to a tran-
sient in the area who had earlier been dis-
regarded as a suspect. Pfingst made history 
for being the first D .A. in California hisro-
ry to be served a warrant in the midst of a 
scandal involving the investigation of for-
mer prosecutor Peter Longanbach for 12 
counts of embezzlement and grand theft. 

Dumanis has served as a Superior Court 
judge since 1998. She has also served in the 
region as a judge in the municipal courts 
and as a deputy district attorney for 12 
years. Dumanis is endorsed by the San 
Diego Police Department and City 
Attorney Casey Gwinn, Her commitment 
to olving criminal problems in San Diego 
County is exhibited by her leadership in the 
city's Central Division Drug Court and 
Domestic Violence Court. 

Dumanis' candidacy garnered the sup-
POrt of 68 percent of the prosecutors cur-
rently working under Pfingst. San Diego 
voters should also note the no-confidence 
vote Pfingst has received from his own staff 
and elect Dumanis for district attorney.

California was suffering from an acute energy 
shortage. All of the "experts" said that prices 
would only rise. Furthermore, energy compa-
nies were not willing to sign any short-tenu 
contracts, forcing Davis to make deals for the 

fifth largest. On his main 
campaign issue of the last 
election, education, he has 
succeeded in reducing class 
sizes, signing landmark legis-

and using government 
money to keep higher educa-

long term. Davis faced a clas-
sic Catch 22: [f he did noth-
ing, he would have been criti -
cized for California having no 
energy, but if he signed the 
contracts, he would be 
blamed for California's 
expensive long-term energy 
costs. The bottom line is that 
he got California through the 
energy crisis by doing what he 
had to do. H e Imew that it

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Davis article neglected 
the Camejo canC:tidacy 

Editor: 
"DeCision: Davis" (Oct. 28 issue 

of the Gum'dian) pretended that the 
only decision is between Gray Davis 
and Bill Simon. No, there is anoth-
er: Peter Camejo, running with the 
California Green Party. As a small-
business owner, entrepreneur and 

economist, Camejo understands 
how to use market forces to sol ve 
social and ecological problems. He is 
a strong supporter of solar eneq,ry 
and has invented several ways of 
financing solar power to make it 
cost-effective for residents and busi-
nesses, and he is also a supporter of 
the UC "Go Solar ow" campaign. 
As a Venezuelan-American, Camejo 
understands that racism and oppres-
sion are not things of the past. 

Unlike both the democrats and 
republicans, the Green slate is not 
composed entirely of white men. 
T he Greens understand that democ-
racy can only work if everyonc's 
v ices are heard. If you're tired of 
bod1 Davis and Simon, remember 
that you have a third choice: Peter 
Camejo for governor!

Modern jazz offends the ears 
though~ 
over a pint 

Chris Taylor 

I t's Sunday night at the International Cork Jazz Festival. Cork's city center 
alone is hosting an additional 40,000 
jazz en thusiasts from all over the 
world this weekend . For rwo nights 
already, jazz has been drumming out 
of every pub, every theater, every 
concert hall and even the grOCl'ry 
stores. Every style of jazz is being 
played, from swing to elevator jazz. 
Its Sunday night at one of the 
biggest music festivals in Europe, 
and you won 't find me at the 
Metripole listening to coundess tal-
ented jazz 'musicians - you will find 
mc at An Bodhran's listening to the 
local rraditional band, Porter House. 

It's not that I dislike jazz. Jazz is 
maybe my favorite music genre. 
However, by listening to timeless, 
si mple and melodic pub anthems, I 
am protesting one of the more con-
fusing music developments ever 
invented: atonal and anarchical 
jazz. You see, tonight's event is 
parading a bunch of elitist jazz 
musicians who find it pleasurable to 
bombard the audience with music 
seemingly designed to not make 
any sense. I n fact, the artists are 
attempting to achieve qui te the 
opposite. 

I almost decided to write a dis-

claimer so that all you music majors 
who specialize in jazz, or just love 
anarchical or atonal music, don't 
bludgeon me with your jazz-orient-
ed insrruments. Then T decided 
that I would invite a good blud-
geoning. Perhaps in the pain of 
having one 's skull cracked open, 
atonal jazz would sound better. 

I'm sorry. I am getting ahead of 
myself. Last night, [ attended a 
concert featuring Bill Frisell. Now, 
I know that Bill Frisell is supposed-
ly an American genius of the jazz 
guitar and a major player in the 
advancement of jazz music , but for 
aliI could hear, sentience was only 
optional in the music he presented 
us . 

I admit that jazz has always been 
a music genre of dissonance. Very 
simply, music theory states that any 
two notes separated by more than a 
fifth is dissonant - hence jazz has 
many sixth and seventh chords. 
Then musicians take many of d1e 
simple rules of dissonance and COI11-
bine them to form what we would 
ca ll jazz, swing, Dixie-land , blues 
and a myriad of other sub-genres. 
However, there are some jazz musi-
cians who have decided it's a good 
idea to take dissonance to an cntin:-
Iy new level by speci ficall y playing 
anything they want, and then 
encouraging their band members to 
play whatever they want at the same 
time. The result is essentially what I 
would call "not-music." 

Regardless, people nOt only 
applauded FriseH, but also 
whooped and hollered when he 
took 3 curt bow. As we all shuffled

out of the theater, many people 
could be heard commenting on the 
ingenuity of the daring jazz they 
just heard. I contest that atonal jazz 
is neither ingenuitive nor daring. 

First of all, many people are 
confusing ingenuity with avant 
garde. When people say that ultra-
modern jazz is not being appreciat-
ed by the masses, it's not that the 
masses are snlpid and tone deaf. In 
fact, there is a reason why most 
people reject it. I deduce, scientifi-
cally, that the reason the masses will 
reject avant garde music is because 
it sucks. Very simply, it doesn 't 
sound good . Specifically, in terms of 
atonal jazz, because it is so chaotic 
and directionless, people will get 
headaches listening to it. Are these 
atonal musicians ahead of other jazz 
musicians in progressing jazz's dis-
sonant quali ties? Yes, but does that 
mean it's ingcnuitive? The only way 
to consider it ingenuitive is if you 
cross the line of insanity to genius. 
Unforrunately, elitist jazz fans have 
opted for the "genius" answer, 
which absolutely baffles me. 

Secondlv, it is certainly not dar-
ing, especi~lly for a famous jazz 
lT1usici,m. In this case: Bill Frisell. A 
popular jazz musician, or one that 
has already established an intellec-
tual wavelength with jazz lovers, 
will have nothing to fear by playing 
chaotically. Ilis fans and other jazz 
lovers will still embra ce him . 
Furthermore, any jazz lover who 
values his intcllccrual status had 
better agree that the music was

Religious liberty vital for freedom 
Freedom to practice religion must be protected,

By JESSICA LlNCiEL 

Associa te Op inion Editor 

People generall}, assume that 
I 'm a huge proponent of separation 
of church and state. After all , I'm 
liberal. I'm religiously ambif.'1.I us. 
On the surface, I could bc the

There's a reason tllat the topic 
IS controversial. Incorpo rating 
relJgion into schools mixes an 
incredibl y personal issue \\~th, a~ . 
environment that is, by definition , 
public. A person's religion is often 
a part of his or her cui mre and 
heri rage. r r IS al ways somethmg 
incredibl )l individual and deeply 
private. A person's beliefs are 

e .~actly that - personal. 
On one level, r recogmze that 

reli gion is so personal that the 
idea of someone impo ing his or 
her faith upon anyone is ludicrous 
and abhorren t. The First 
Amendment's protection of reli -
gious freedom is one of the most 
important civil ri ghts we have. At 
the same time, because religion is 
so personal , there is no way to 
escape it. Religion is a belief struc-
mre, and wha t you believe is an 
inherently individual ri ght. 

The line blurs when ir comes 
to people advocating th e protec-

removal of all signs of religion

she had moved to London to be with 
her second husband, experimental 
composer Peter Gordon. The punk 
writer turned literary celebri ty contin-
ued to write novels, stories, essays, a 
film script and an opera libretto. In

With book titles like "Hannibal Lecter, My Father" and "Pussy, King of the Pirates," it is not difficult to imagine that Kathy Acker had a difficult time getting her work 
published in the 1970s. However, the UCSD alumna 
eventually became a prominent figure in the pOSt-
modernist movement. After her death on Nov. 29, 
1997, at a holistic treatment facility in Tijuana, some 
worried that her work might disappear into the obliv-
ion of dusty library shelves. Far from disappearing, 
however, last month saw the publication of "Essential 
Acker," an anthology of her writing and the first acad-
emic conference in her honor will be held Nov. 7 and 
Nov. 8. 

Acker was born in 1944 in

In the early '90s, she created the writing department 
at the San Francisco Art Institute before moving back to 
London in 1995. It was there that Acker was diagnosed 
with breast cancer. 

Back in San Francisco, Acker underwent a double 
mastectomy. She chose to rely on faith healers and alter-
native medicine both for financial and spi ritual reasons. 
In an article at the time, Acker wrote, "I knew 1 wanted 
to live. To live was to stay alive and to not be reduced to 
materiality. There was no way I was going to go through 
chemothera py. " 

Direct and unapologetic are the words to describe 
Acker. New readers are often surprised by the graphic 
sexual imagery and language that abounds in her work, 
but these descriptions are not necessarily employed sim-
ply for their shock value. 

"It's not just that it's explicit,

In 1963, she went to

the classics. It was at th is time, 
at the age of 19, that she mar-
ried Robert Acker, a penniless 
1 7 -year-old friend, in what 
would be a short-lived mar-
riage. 

In 1965, she came to UCSD 
to study under Herberr 
Marcuse, a Marxist psychologist. 
She also studied poetry during 
the 1960s under Jerome 
Rothenburg before turning to

but that it's a form of feminine 
abjection ," said UCSD literature 
professor Judith Halberstam, 
who will speak at the upcoming 
conference on Acker. Acker fre-
quently used a masochistic, self-
deprecating voice in her novels. 

"This is the gesture that peo-
pl e object to. It's like she's say-
ing 'If you think that women are 
just T and A, let me perform 
this role for you,'" Halberstam 
said.

literature professor 

It is through this perfor-
mance of societal expectations 
that Acker seeks to change the 
rules and have the reader ques-
tion what they truly desire. 

novel writing. 
Her early works, half-poetry, half-prose concoc-

tions, were all self-published or produced by small 
underground presses. She had to carry them from 
bookshop to books hop to sell them. Although she 
could have worked as an academic, she claimed that she 
did not want any distractions from her writing. 
Instead, she worked mindless jobs, including one in the 
sex industry. 

Her breakthrough came in 1984 with "Blood and 
Guts in High School," an emotional novel infused with 

Acker's writing also involves 
taking passages from famous texts and implanting 
them into her own works with Ii ttle or no change, a 
technique referred to as "pastiche." It is a technique 
used to "re-identify" with the classics; Acker seeks to 
rewrite these canonical, classic pieces from a female 
perspective . Halberstam assigned Acker 's novel, 
"Great Expectations," to her literature class this quar-
ter. • 

"[pastiche] has become a trademark thing with her,"

Acker's Legacy of Prose 

"Bodies of Work" 

Acker's first book is a 175-
page collection of scholarly 
and provocative essays, 
covering everything from 
body-building to the work 
of contemporary artists and 
philosophers. 

"Hannibal Lector. My 
Father" 

Acker collects a handful of 
early and hard-to-find 
works including "New York 
City in 1979:' "Lust," liThe 
Birth of the Poet," and a 
fragment of the previously 
unpublished "Politics." 

"Pussy. King of the 
Pirates" 
Acker transforms Robert 
Louis Stevenson's classic 
"Treasure Island" into a wild 
trek through real and imag-
ined history, including the 
most famous whorehouse 
in Alexandria. 

"Empire of the 
Senseless", 

Set in the near future, in a 
Paris devastated by revolu-

rates a story between two 
terrorists and occasional 
lovers, 

"Pussycat Fever" 

This embellished edition 
includes excerpts from 
"Pussy, King of Pirates" and 
includes original illustra-

"My Mother: 
Demonology. a Novel" 

Based loosely on the rela-

ence of her work," Halberstam 
said, who suggested that her writ-
ing might not be meant to last in 
the same form and purpose after 
her death as it did while she lived. 

As of now, most of Acker's 
books are still in print. The earlier 
works are not so easy to find, but 
with some searching one can still 
locate them. 

A conference on Acker's work, 
"Lust For Life, The Writings of 
Kathy Acker," will be held on Nov. 
7 and Nov. 8 in the Fales Library 
at NYU. The Fales Library holds 
the largest collection of materials 
about the downtown New York 
scene from the 1970s to the 
I 990s. 

"It was time for a serious schol-
arly symposium on Acker's work 

writing, 
cerned. 

Taylor appeared uncon-

"Controversial? Maybe to the 
radical right. Maybe in 1975. The 
work is still fresh, still challenging, 
still vibrant. Yes, it deals with sex in 
a non-apologetic way. The narra-
tives are sexy. Its part of, but not all 
of, the importance of the work," 
Taylor said. 

This being the case, it seems 
that Acker's writing has long been 
fulfilling the purpose that was 
intended. Society has changed, and 
this can be attributed in part to the 
writings of postmodernists. With 
this knowledge, it is clear that no 
matter how many of her pieces 
remain in print in the coming 
years, Acker will continue to live 
through those that she has affected.

Where can I find the most 
accurate and current informa-
tion on medical conditions and 
medications? 

- Tuy, Earl Wn77'e1I Collegt 

The Internet has become an 
essential source of information, but 
it is important to assess the accuracy 
of this information. This can be 
done by determining what a Web 
site is trying to sell. Reliable sites 
usually only give information. 

Web sites maintained by phar-
maceutical manufactures are usual-
ly good about not presenting mis-
information, but information on 
alternative therapies is limited. 

Sites maintained by foundations 
and association.;, such as the 
American Cancer Society, are use-
ful in providing patient-oriented 

. information on disease state and 
management; they often provide 
links to other reputable sites. 

Although online pharmacies are 
a major source of drug information 
for the layman, there are those 
whose services are questionable. In 
order to avoid this pitfall. choose a 
Web site not affiliated with online 
dispensing, such as 
http://wiUW.rxlirt.com or 
http://1Jl7JI7JJ.phamrwtb. ntt. 

Sources for clinical information 
aimed at researching disease states 
and treatment options include 
http://WiUW.Wtbmd.com and 
http://1Jl7JI7JJ.mtdscapt.com. 

What is the best treatment for 
a recreational sports injwy? 

- Miltt, John Muir CoUtgt 

It is important for the recre-
ational sports athlete to treat an 
injury as soon as possible. Rest, ice, 
compression then elevation 
(RICE) is the best immediate 
treatment for the injury. This will 
prevent further trauma. 

Following an injury. it is impor-
tant to consider that taking pain 
medication just masks the pain and 
does not actually treat the condi-
tion. Avoid continued participation 
in the recreational activity until the 
injury has healed. 

For the treatment of minor 
acute sPOrts injuries, aceta-
minophen (fylenol), ibuprofen 
(Advil, Motrin) and naproxen sodi-
um (A1eve) are the most common 
choices for pain relief. Advise your 
pharmacist or physician of your

Soccer: 
Dominating 
performance 

ends schedule 
continued from page 20 

"The girls battled hard on a 
field that was not for soccer," 
McManus said. 

The Tritons rolled into an early 
advantage in the marathon match, 
which they held onto and added to as 
the game went on. The UCSD 
women's soccer team showed its 
resiliency in the face of hurdles and 
led from start to finish. 

Triton sophomore Britni Wenck 
captured the crucial first goal for 
the afternoon, completing a suc-
cessful shot after the ball rebound-
ed off the crossbar. 

The eight corner - kicks that 
UCSD had are exempla ry of the 
fact that the Tritons kept the offen-
sive heat on Grand Canyon 
University, with the game played 
predominantly on the Antelopes' 
side of the field . 

UCSD's Kristin Jones, Lauren 
Jacobs and Christine Kwon estab-
lished themselves as offensive 
superstars in the game, responsible 
for numerous corner kicks and 
attempted shots. 

With less than seven minutes 
left in the game, the Tritons guar-
anteed victory with an additional 
goal from freshman Kristina De 
La Rosa off an indirect kick taken 
by teammate sopho more Jacki e 
Shaffer. 

The tight Triton defense dug in 
its heels in the warm luster of the 
Arizona sun and withstood the 
charges of the Antelope~ . 

The sole saving grace for the 
aggressive but sophomoric perfor-
mance of the Antelopes, which 
logged a total of 12 fouls versus the 
10 by UCSD, was its senior goal-
keeper, Jolene Gagnon, who 
blocked many of the Triton shots. 

Tritons junior goalkeeper Kami 
Poma deflected a shot in the second 
half, which effectively brought an 
end to the few late pushes of the 
Antelopes. 

Low attendance figures at 
Grand Canyon University'S Soccer 
Complex was also a factor in bring-
ing about the demoralized state of 
the Antelopes . 

The UCSD women's soccer team 
improved to 13-2-1 overall and 11 -
2 -I in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association, while the 
Antelopes tanked during the season 
with a record of 2-17-1 overall and 
1-13 in the CCAA. 

The Tritons mounted a spectacu-
lar comeback from last weeks tie 
against Cal Poly Pomona and utiliz-
ing the dexterity and perseverance 
they exemplified in the game against 
the Antelopes. 

The Tritons do not have any 
time to savor the moment. No. 6-
ranked UCSD will play in the 
CCAA Championship, which will 
begin Nov. 7 at Sonoma State's 
Seawolf Soccer Field.

continued from page 20 
the moment; we've made some 
changes and we've got some surpris-
es in store for the game," Annstrong 
said. "We need to hold them with 
our defense, which has been giving 
up goals lately, but we've been scor-
ing goals, too, which is goOd .. No 
one expects us to do anything in the 
playoffs, and hopefully we can use 
that to our advantage."

UCSD wins one, loses one 
Victory at UCSB is second in 22 years 

By OWEN MAIN 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's water polo team traveled 
north for consecutive games against two teams from 
the powerful Mountain Pacific Sports Federation 
Conference on Nov. I and Nov. 2. 

On Nov. 1, the Tritons traveled to UC Santa 
Barbara to take on the Gauchos, with which they 
had split two games earlier in the season. UCSD 
started out sluggish against the home team; the 
game was tied at one after the first period, but 
UCSB took a 3-2 lead going into halftime. 

"We had opporTUnities in the first half," said 
senior goalkeeper Lance Onken . "The difference 
was we capitalized on them in the second." 

In the third quarter, the Tritons put the 
Gauchos away. Two consecutive goals by sopho-
more utility Jon Hopkins gave the Tritons the lead. 
A goal by sophomore utility player Clark Peterson 
and another on a six-on-five situation by offensive 
player Bryon Spicer gave UCSD four unanswered 
goals and a three-goal lead going into the final 
period. In the fourth quarter, UCSB couldn't 
mount a comeback and the Tritons held on for the 
7 -4 victory. 

"It was a full team effort," Hopkins said . 
"Everybody contributed." 

Onken agreed, and pointed to Hopkins' and 
Spicer's goals as key. 

"Jon's and Spicer's goals in the third quarter 
were huge," said Onken of his teammates' third 
quarter scoring outburst. 

The win at UCSB was a big one not only for the 
Triton team this year, but also for the program. 

"This is only the second win in Santa Barbara in 
[coach Denny Harper's] 22 years at UCSD," 

. Hopkins said. 
On Nov. 2, the Tritons looked to take some 

momenTUm into their game at Long Beach State 
University against the 4gers. But the UCSD 
offense ran into a wall in the form of Long Beach 
State goalkeeper Thomas Onyshko, who had a 
career-high 14 saves to lead the 4gers over the 
Tritons 11-7. 

Despite a sluggish UCSD start, the Triton 

Cuordion file photo 
Home stretch: The Tritons have just fIVe games left 
before the WWPA tournament v.i1ich will be held at UCSD. 
found themselves down only 5-3 at halftime. 
However, in the second half the floodgates 
opened. Long Beach scored four unanswered 
goals to take a commanding 9-3 advantage in the 
third period. 

Outscoring the 4gers 4-2 in the final period 
TUrned out to be too little, too late for the Tritons . 

"We TUrned it on the fourth," said Hopkins, who 
nerred two goals in the final peri od to give him a 
total of four for the weekend. "But it was too late. 
There wasn't a lot of movement out there. It just 
wasn 't clicking [against the 4gersJ." 

Onken agreed with Hopkins's take on the ga me. 
"It was a tough game. It shows that we sti ll have 

some room to grow," he said. 
The Tritons (16-1 0 overall) will have a test of 

that growth in their next game against conference 
and national power UC Irvine on Nov. 9 at 6 p.m. 
The game will be the Tritons' final regular season 
home game before the WWPA tournament, which 
will be held at Canyon view Pool this year. 

"We 're looking forward to playing them," said 
Onken of UCI. "This will give us more good expe-
rience against good MPSF teams." 

The Anteaters are nationally ranked No. 5.

Golf team places fifth 
Godoski ties for third in tourney 

By JOE SPANO 
Staff Writer 

The golf team competed in the 
Elco Invitational on Oct. 28 and Oct. 
29, taking fifth place in a field of seven 
teams. The tournament was hosted by 
Cal State Bakersfield and was played 
at the difficult par-71 Stocksdale 
Counoy Club in Bakersfield, Calif. 

"Even though this course was 
1,200 yards shorter than Crosswater 
Club, [the site of the season's first 
tournament), the scores were much 
higher," said UCSD head coach 
Mike Wydra. "Stocksdale has a very 
traditional design, lots of doglegs, 
deep roughs and fast greens." 

Chico State TUrned in strong per-
formances both days, shooting 281, 
293 and 286 in the three rounds, 
leading the tournament in both the 
first and third rounds. The Chico 
team finished in first with an 8-over-
par 860 and three of its golfers plac-
ing in the top 10. 

CSU Bakersfield, UC Davis and 
St. Martin's College were all able to 
break a team total score of 900, with 
scores of 870, 879 and 887, respec-
tively. St. Martin had the lowest team 
score for a round - a 291 in the sec-
ond - but two other rounds of just 
under 300 left the team 27 strokes 
behind Chico State. 

UCSD finished with a score of 
901, shooting 303, 298 and 300 in 
the three respective rounds, putting 
it at 49 over par. The Tritons were 
competitive in the second round, 
where they only shot seven strokes 
higher than the leader, but their 
scores of 300 and 303 left them 41 
strokes behind Chico State at the end 
of the tournament. 

Cal State S ~n Bernardino and 

Northwest Nazarene rounded out 
the rest of the top seven, with scores 
of 929 and 931, respectively. 

Individually, UCSD junior Jan 
Godoski tied for third place wi th 
DJ. Fernando of CSU Bakersfield , 
each shooting impressive scores of 
214, I-over-par. Godoski had one of 
only five rounds under par in the 
tournament, and the second -best 
round of the dav on Oct. 28, with a 
67 in th e second round . 

"J an had an excellent perfor-
mance for his first tournament of the 
year," Wydra said. "When you get a 
solid group of good players together, 
they will progress at their own rate, 
and he definitely stepped up this 
time ." 

After Godoski was junior Alan 
Scheer, who was coming off an 
impressive 2-over-par finish in the 
Tritons' first season of the year, with 
a l3 -over-par 226, landing him in 
21st place at the Eko lnvitational. 
The next UCSD golfer was fresh-
man Robbie Kramer - who posted a 
5-over-par in the previous tourna-
ment - with an 18-over-par score of 
231, givi ng him a 26th place fi nish. 

The two remaining 1l-itons that 
co mpeted, freshma n Ryo Yall1ada 
and senior Blake Schneider, tied for 
28th and 31 st, respectively. Yamada 
shot a 20-over-par 233 , and 
Schneider scored 234, 21-over-par. 

Looking ahead, the Tritons will 
compete in another tournament on 
Nov. 4 and Nov. 5, playing on the La 
Quinta co urse loca ted in Palm 
Desert, Calif. 

"This course is ra ted one of the 
top 50 courses in the U.S.," Wyd ra 
said of La Quinta, guaranteeing a 
good tournament and a challenge for 
UCSD .

Realizing 
what Sir 
Charles 
didn't 

From the 
Front Row 

Bryce Warwick 

C harles Barkley once said, "I am not a role model." He intended this quote 
to express his lack of desire to have 
his li fe scrutiniz.ed, so that he might 
be free to live the way he wanted 
wi thout the eyes of the public upon 
him. Charles, it's JUSt not possible. 

The responsibility of conducting 
onesel f in a positive manner is inher-
ent 111 bei ng a public figure. That's a 
Ie son I learned the hard way. 

In my last colunm, I wrote some 
very ~cathing and Impntdent com-
ments about the students of Cal 
Sta te San Bernardino and die sur-
rounding community. It was my 
bebef that these comments might be 
read by a few UCSD students who 
would get a little laugh from them, 
and then that my words would fade 
into obscurity. I was very wrong. 

News of my column spread to 
San Bernardino rather quickly, and 
within days T was receiving con-
demning e-mails and hearing word 
that I'd offended a great deal of 
people. 

When a reporter from the San 
Brmardino SU7l asked to talk to me, 
I realized that this issue had 
become bigger that I'd ever imag-
ined it would be. 

I re-read the col umn I'd written 
wi th a fresh perspective. I put 
myself in the shoes of the people 
about whom I'd written, I saw the 
conclusions I would have drawn, 
and I realized just how cheap some 
of the shots I'd taken had been. 

I felt bad . All of Halloween night 
I laid in bed thinking. With fear, 
trepidation and remorse, I lay there, 
looking up at the glow-in-the-dark 
stars on the ceiling above me, won-
dering how many writers before me 
had stared at stars slightly more per-
manent and thought the same thing. 

I went too far. I tried to be 
humorous and engaging and I ended 
up being a jerk. Now how can I make 
it right? There's really only one 
thing I can say. 

I apologize. 
r apologize to the students of 

CSUSB, to the people of San 
Bernardino, and to you, my read-
ers. In writing what I wrote, and in 
sayi ng things that I do not honestly 
believe, I was not loyal to you or 
my purpose. My words were imma-
ture and went outside the bound-
aries of good taste, and I'm sorry. 

T don't apologize because 1 have 
to; public figures have escaped 
removal from office and murder 
convictions without an apology. I 
apologize because 1 know that I was 
wrong and because I'm coming to 
realize what Charles Barkley did not. 

I am a role model. By putting my 
name and face next to these words I 
endorse them and agree to a contract 
by which I allow my indiscretions to 
be scrutinized. Life in the public eye 
- no matter how small the public or 
how watchful the eye - demands 
holding one 's behavior to a higher 
standard. 

I failed to meet that standard , 
and I've learned my lesson. Once. 

This won't happen again.

Men's soccer advances to postseason 
Tritons earn' berth with OT victory over Grand Canyon 

By JOE SPANO 
Staff Writer 

UCSD finished its regular sea-
son in style on Nov. 2 with a crucial 
4-3 road victory against Grand 
Canyon University. The victory, 
coupled with a loss by Cal Poly 
Pomona, ensured that the Tritons 
kept their first place standing in the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association South Division and wi ll 
advance to the playoffs next week. 

"It was an all-around good 
game; we got everyone into play," 
said UCSD head coach Derek 
Armstrong. "Grand Canyon won 
their last game and wa hoping to 
finish strong." 

Grand Canyon wasted no time 
getting on the board at 3:54, when 
Luka Muslin scored off a pass from 
teammate Marcelo Soria, giving the 
Antelopes a quick \-0 lead. The 
Tritons followed with some solid 
play that resulted in an unassisted 
goal at 25 :55 from UCSD freshman 
Grant ishio, who kicked in a 
rebound off Grand Canyon's goal-
keeper. 

The Antelopes entered halftime 
with a 2-\ lead, however, after 
Grand Canyon's Marcelo Soria 
scored on a penalty kick at 39:06. 

The Tritons quickly evened the 
score at 2-2 with Junior Ali 
Managhebi's first goal of the game, 
which came by way of a pass from 
sophomore 1iago Venturi 46 sec-
onds into the second half. UCSD 

then took its first lead of the day 
when freshman Matthew Davey net-
ted a shot from 30 yards out, making 
it 3-2. With only 1:18 left to play, 
Soria struck again for the Antelopes 
with his second goal of the game on 
an unassisted shot, forcing the game 
into overtime, tied at three apiece. 

Just as the Tri tons started out 
the second half strong, they came 
out equally strong in overtime, 
scoring at 93 :04 when Managhebi 
scored his second goal of the game 
off a cross from the left corner by 
sophomore Magnus Lu. 

"Our last three goals of the 
game were just great goals," 
Armstrong said. ' 

The Tritons outshot the 
Antelopes 13-10, including the sole 
shot in overtime that yielded the 
winning·goal. UCSD also had seven 
corner kicks to Grand Canyon's two. 
In addition, the Triton goalkeeping 
duo of junior Jeremy Cookson and 
sophomore Scott Mazurier com-
bined for six saves. 

Looking ahead, UCSD will 
begin the playoffs this week with a 
game against CCAA Cenual oppo-
nent Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
While CSU Domingue,z Hills beat 
the Tritons in their first meeting 
this year, the Tritons are now 
accustomed to their style of play 
and should be ready for them this 
second time around . 

"We've got something going at

Title run: The tv't'O-time defending Division II national champion Tritons ended

Staff Writer 

The Tritons dominated their 
final game of the season against 
Grand Canyon University on 
Nov. 2 with a 2-0 win, despite 
playing in particularly difficult 
terrain. 

Visiting UCSD scored a goal 
in each half, punctuati ng its 
dOlninance over the Antelopes in 
everything but saves and fouls . 
Nevertheless, the Tritons 
encountered many obstacles dur-
ing the game. 

"It was a hard game, with a 
bumpy field," said Triton head 
coach Brian McManus of the 
logistical challenges the Tritons 
faced at their away game. 

Despite the daunting task 
that the hostile turf offered 
them, the Tritons fought with 
ambition and took care of busi-
ness, taking a huge lead in shots 
from the start of the game, even-
tually transforming into a 14-5 
ratio against the lethargic 
Antelopes.

Women's volleyball 
has streak snapped 

By BRYCE WARWICK 
Staff Writer 

SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. 
- Despite the build-up for its 
showdown with conference rival 
Cal State San Bernardino, the 
UCSD women's volleyball team 
came out flat against the Coyotes 
and squandered its shot at the top 
spot in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association. The Tritons 
were able to salvage something 
from their weekend the next night 
with a 3-0 sweep of Cal Poly 
Pomona. 

The loss at CSUSB snapped the 
Tritons' nine-game winning streak, 
and UCSD's record now stands at 
20-4 overall and 14-3 in the CeM. 

Within the past couple of years, 
the rivalry between CSUSB and 
UCSD has expanded from a battle 
between two intensely competitive 
teams to something that evokes 
enmity between the players and 
the schools. Given that, the 
Tritons' complete lack of energy 
and extremely tentative play on 
Nov. 1 came as a surprise to the 
season-high 517 spectators on 
hand at CoussouIis Arena. 

The match's opening gave the 
appearance that a classic duel was 
about to unfold, with no team 
managing to open up much of a 
lead. Kim Morohunfola was strong 
early for the Coyotes - she tallied 
the first several of her 10 kills on 
the evening in game one. The 
Tritons made every attempt to 
respond, but in the end it was 
CSUSB playing strong down the 
stretch to take a 30-27 victory. 

Game two followed a similar 
pattern, and even though the 
Coyotes managed to get a lead 
early, the Tritons rallied to tie the 
score at 28-28. A crucial service 

error deflated the Triton run, and 
CSUSB took the game 30-28. 

Facing a 2-0 deficit, UCSD 
looked incapable of mounting any 
kind of a serious threat in the third 
game, and despite a solid effort 
from Stacy Dunsmore - she put 
down the last of her team-high 17 
kills - and a late run that brought 
the score to a respectable 30-26, 
the Tritons were swept. 

After coming in on such a roll 
and expecting a more competitive 
match, the Tritons were stunned 
by the sweep. 

"We were all just in shock," 
said middle blocker Kendra 
Canape. "[Against CSUSB] , you 
almost felt like there was nothing 
you could do." 

Determined to begin another 
winning streak, UCSD found the 
energy it had been lacking the night 
before when it came in to face the 
Broncos of Cal Poly Pomona. 

"The energy was a nine or a 10 
the whole time," Canape said. "It 
was a good game for us and a good 
way to come back from [the loss] ." 

Bonnie Wilson led the charge 
with 16 kills, Dunsmore picked up 
17 digs and Canape added 1 0 kills 
of her own on 14 attempts and 
only one error while the Tritons 
rolled to a 3-0 victory (30-27,30-
27,30-24). 

The win was an improvement 
for the Tritons after narrowly 
defeating the Broncos in five 
games during a Sept. 27 match at 
UCSD, but that improvement is 
not enough. For the Tritons to 
accomplish their goals, they will 
have to find a way to defeat 
CSUSB. With only five CCAA 
games remaining, a likely rematch 
in the regional playoffs looms, but 
to get there UCSD will have to 
bring the energy every night.
