RecruiterIncident HearingEnd8 
Report Sent to Chancellor 

During a four hour hearing last 
Wednesday night, the Faculty-
student Committee on Student 
Conduct completed the hearing 
phase ot its investigation into 
the February 21 recruiter con-
trontation. The committee will 
now prepare a report ot the in-
cident and inform Chancellor Mc-
Gill of its recommendations. 

Seven of the Committee's eight 
members, three students and 
tour faculty members, were pre-
sent at the hearings, with one 
taculty member renouncing his 
vote and assuming the chairman-
ship of the meeting. All eight 
of the detendants were present 
and the proceedings were viewed 
by about 100 people. 

In the opening phase of the 
hearing Dean Murphy sought to 
prove that the defendants were 
part of the group which blocked 
the entrance to the Placement 
Office. The Dean stated that 
a movie film of the incident, 
supplied by Dr. Geddes, Dir-
ector of the Placement Office,-
had proven "imperfect and in-
complete." He and two ot his 
staff members then testified but 
their reports were disputed by 
the defendants and the hearing 
appeared stalemated. 

At this point the defendants 
changed their tactics. Conced-
ing, "for the purposes of the 
trial", that they were present 
on the steps, the defendants en-
abled Dean Murphytotestlfycon-
cerning the incident itself. Res-
ponding to questions from the 
committee, Dean Murphy said 
that the entrance to the Place-
ment Office was effectively blo-
cked and that his request to enter 
the building had been denied. He 
stated that no physical attempt 
was made to enter the building 
and that the incident ended with-
out any violence. 

At one point Dean Murphy was 
asked if there were other en-
trances to the building and whe-
ther he had thought about using 
them. The Dean answered that 
although there are mther ent-
rances to the building, he re-
fused to escalate the confront-
ation by attempting to run for 
the other doors. 

The hearing entered its criti-
cal phase, however, when Dean 
Murphy read off the charges 
against the students. The Hand-
book on Student Conduct requires 

students to refrain from dis-
rupting the educational process of 
the University, and continues by 
listing the types of interference 
prohibited. The defendants are 
presently charged with tour dif-
ferent types of interference under 
this section. 

The students, however, con-
tend that Marine recruitment, or 
any form of military recruitment, 
is not a legitimate! part of the 
educational process and that it 
violates the educational philo-
sophy ot the University. Thus 
if mil1tary recruitment is not 
part ot the educational process, 
then they have not broken the 
rules under this section. The 
administration's position seemed 
to be that the additional sections 
merely filled out the general 
statement on educational policy 
rather than being dependent on 
the introductory paragraph. 

Presented with differing in-
terpretations of the section, the 
committee had to decide whether 
to continue discussing the rule. 
Since it appeared that the stu-
dents were basing their defense 
on the disputed section, the com-
mittee voted to continue discus-
sion. The students then began 
their defense, attempting to con-
vince the committee that mili-
tary recruitment violated educ-
ational policy. 

The detendants led off their 
defense by attacking ' the army 
as a racist institution. Using 
statistics and selected example:, 
the students demonstrated that 
non-whites are over-represented 
in the armed services and that 
they suffer greater casualities 
in Vietnam than their numbers 
would warrent. The armed ser-
vices also discriminate in choos-
ing its officers, especially by 
recruiting for officers from white 
universities. 

The defendants quoted Dean 
. Murphy as stating that pOlitical 
institutions were restricted from 
recruiting on campus, and they 
attempted to prove that the Mar-
ines are a political institution 
as well as "a political tool". 
Marine intervention in Haiti and 
the Dominican Republic were 
sighted as well as United Na-
tions statistics on education and 
health. These figures show that 
the U.S. intervenes to set up 
puppet governments rather than 

to improve the welfare of the 
people. At the end of the test-
imony, Dean Murphy stated that 
political institutions cannot re-
cruit for members although they 
may recruit for positions of em-
ployment. 

The defendants also charged 
that the University trains stu-
dents to be technicans and of-
ficers. They stated that some 
of UCSD's professors receive 
grants or fellowships from the 
government, and that many of 
these agreements have a clause 
in them which requires univer-
sities to accept military recruit-
ers or forfeit the money. 

Prof. Ron Kirby, member of 
the philosophy department, de-
fended the students in testimony 
before the committee. Contend-
ing that the government is com-
mitting murder in Vietnam, Prof. 
Kirby stated that the "Univer-
sity seems to be compromised" 
by Its involvement in the war. 
The University is a moral in-
stitution, he stated, committed 
to "rationality" and the edu-
cation of "people". He believes 
that the University simply can-
not let the armed forces re-
cruit for murder. 

Finishing off their defense, 
the students stated that "dir-
ect collective political action", 
such as they undertook, is the 
only way to change things in 
this country. Asked by the com-
mittee if they had tried any other 
forms of protest, the students 
replied that their picketing of 
Dow Chemical and of govern-
ment recruiting proved their 
point. Inspite of such efforts 
military recruitment continued 
and indeed it took a confront-
ation to bring the issue under 
discussion. They also pointed 
out that the convention in Chi-
cago and the McCarthy camp-
aign fUrther demonstrates the 
effects of criticism in our coun-
try. 

At the end of the hearing, a 
heated exchange summed up the 
possible mood of the committee. 
While arguing with the defen-
dants over the causes and forms 
of protes t, one committee mem-
ber shot back, "I may condemn 
what you did, but not what you 
stand for". This seems to sum 
up the dilemma which now faces 
the committee in its deliber-
ations. 

ACLU CODlDlents on Protests 
New York (CPS)--The Amer-

ican Civil Liberties Union has 
called on students to "return to 
peaceful methods of protest," 
while criticiZing university ad-

ministrations for "stoking the

board of directors, said that

S • Y R ment late last week, was imme-ring our eg. dlately attacked by four New York 
attorneys, all associated with the 

C d d V, New York branch of the nation-ar 5 an 0 e wide organization. Th four were 
critical of the statement's em-

SpecitlcaUy, they mentioned 

the ACLU phrase that campus

"To add the voice mf the ACLU 
to the repressive forces already 
at work against social change 
in our society," the four con-
tinued, "seems counter-produc-
tive if not dangerous at this 
time." The lawyers--all of whom 
have defended activists in court--
said it was far better to empha-
size the conditions that force 
students to violence than to "fo-
cus on the militant response they 
have bred."

Ll Supporters Celebrate, 
Administration Gets Up Tight 

In the bright sunshine on the 
Revelle quad yesterday, Lum-
umba- Zapata supporters decided 
that the administration was too 
uptight and what would be good 
for everybody would be a big 
party with a little talk. 

The sun was warm, and so 
was the grass and grape juice 
and, so, eventually, was the ral-
ly. Also getting warm, though, 
was Provost Saltman as he ask-
ed the assembly to quiet down. 
He was substantially ignored, 
although the music of Mudd was 
replaced by the softer strains of 
Congo drums. 

The actual talking lasted only 
a few minutes. It was pri-
marily concerned with the pre-
cuations the administration al-
legedly has taken against a pos-
sible take over of a building by 
students supporting LZ. Pre-

cautions taken reportedly in-
clude: bolting all the entrances 
to the utility tunnels; instruc-
tions to the secretaries in the 
Library and Computer Center on 
what to do in case a lot of 
students came to visit them sud-
dently(nothing); suspicious wires 
and floodlights; presence of an 
usual number of plainclothesmen 
on campus; statements (off the 
record) by Chancellor McGill to 
California newspapers seeking 
their support in case a confront-
ation occurs; and removal of 
pregnant women from areas part-
icularly vulnerable to student 
take over. To the students, 
these actions constituted an act 
of bad faith by McGill in that 
impliCit in them was the belief 
that a compromise would not be 
reached. Dean Murphy showed 
up later in the rally to dispute 
that contention. 

'Academic Senate Hears 
Students on LZ College 

Last Tuesday's Academic Sen-
ate meeting was marked by a 
crowd of over a hundred stu-
dents interested in the proposed 
Lumumba- Zapata College. 

The initial part of the meet-
ing was taken up with the issue 
of seating observers. Some of 
the faculty objected to the s tu-
dent participation but in the end 
75 were permitted seats and 
sound equipment was hastily pro-
vided by the students for those 
outside the door. 

A statement was given by BSC 
in response to Chance Hor Mc-
Gill's statement. They char-
ged that a proposal was given to 
the Chancellor and nothing was 
achieved. BSC claimed that the 
Chancellor "was making a pub-
lic emotional statement" thus 
making the issue more difficult. 

BSC/MA YA further said that 
they were confused a to who they 
are negotiating with. They also 
charged that Murphy was asked 
to "rewrite not reform" the 
demands. 

Robert Carillo made the sec-
ond statement for MAYA noting 
that the administration was "us-
ing your own standards" and dis-
cussed the function of the Board 
of Directors. 

Suzana Care mad a state-
ment for the whit stud nts il-

Third College Provo t Rap-

sions betwe n BSC/ M Y A and 
th third coli g • H noted 

that thus far both sides agree 
on an "academically excellent" 
college with a "student voice" 
and minorities. He urged the 
Senate to encourage the discus-
sions which prompted various 
confused motions from the fioor . 

Prof. Marcuse asked for a 
representative of SSC to give 
their fee lings on the discuss-
ions. Aner some haggling over 
rules with the chairman, Ozzie 
Davis was permitted to r espond. 

He emphasized the need lor a 
distinct college system since 
Revelle and Muir aren't that 
different. Davis also insisted 
upon the Lumumba-Zapata Col-
lege as "an alternative plan not 
incorporated" or "subjugated" 
to the already existing plan. 

Rappaport said that th re were 
other technical details such as 
the number of units and courses 
that can b retained from the 
original plan. 

Prof. Watson saiel that th y 
"cannot use the third college

thing for keeping tI stud nt

town is best known Cor its "fav-

in Army and Marine bases on

program to a traditional curf 
riculum. An educational pro-
gram for minority students 
should instead grow out of their 
own environment, experiences, 
and needs. We therefore com-
ment BSC/MAYA for having res-
ponded imaginatively to Provost 
Rappaport's request by submit-
ting their proposals for Lumum-
ba-Zapata College. We further 
commend BSC/ MAYA and the 
third college planning faculty for 
having entered into constructive 
negotiations. And urge that the 
negotiations be carried on with 
due haste. 

A special meeting was set up 
for next week, May 6, devoted 
to a report from BSC/MAYA and 

In mid-March a young Marine, 
Craig Murp!ly of Miami, Fla., 
who was stationed at nearby 
Camp Pendleton, applied at the 
church for sanctuary from the 
military. He said he would sub-
ject himself to arrest, oIfer no 
physical resistance ; but that he 
wa;}ted to make known his views 
on the war and the military in 
general--views he could not make 
public from his base. 

Whittie r is beginning to look 
pretty good to AWOL service-
men; another is David Jones of 
McCulloch, Ark., who had been 
AWOL once before, courtmar-
tialed and thrown in the brig. 
But Whittier is nicer than the 
brig, so Jones, along with two of 
his gu~rds, ~<;caped from his 
ba.~~ ~nd gained sanctuary there.

The Board of Trustees of the 
church granted sanctuary, citing 
thei r respect for .. freedom of 
conscience and the right to dis-
sent". For ten days Murphy 
lived in the church, while towns-
people and local college stu-
dents kept him company. As 
agr '!l!d, the Shore Patrol in the 
area WJ :~ notified that he was 
there afl:i that he would not re-
sist arr~st . 

At 2 a.m. or. March 20 (the 
tenth day), two Marines trom 
Murphy's base, wear ; 19 civilian 
clothes, broke into the church 
and askpd to see the A WO L Mar-
ine alone. While one of them 
kept the crowd occupied in one 
room, the other beat Murphy 
and dragged him outside and into 
the back seat of the Ir waiting 
car. The car got away, but was 
stopped almost immediately by 

' police for a traffic violation. 
Police freed the two Marines-

phy over to authoritie'>, who 
promptly put him in the brig.

The "Whittier three" remain 
in the church, visited by a con-
stant flow of people 24 hours a 
day. The church has oot Sit a 
qlJota on AWOL servicemen, al-
though it is obvious that the 
church's activities have been al-
tered a great deal by their pre-
sence. Religious services ari 
held daily, feat uring different 
religions each day. A seder was 
ce labrated at Passover, and tile 
following weekend Bishop James 
Pike held a service. 

The church's policy is to in-
form the Shore Patrol about the 
servicemen In sanr.tuary, au·ji,l-
vite them to come if they wish. 
So far they have refused the in-
vitation. 

Pastor Richard Weston is sur-
prised by the lack of adverse 
reaction to the sanctuary In this 
southern California town. Press 
coverage has been fair, and in 
general, he says, there is sup-
port among townspeople. "They

Harpsichordist William Read 
will join with viola da gambist 
Peter Farrell and performing 
musicians at the University of 
California, San Diego on May 5 
to present a "Chancellor's Con-
cert' under the auspices of the 
Department of Music, celebrat-
ing the recent inauguration of 
UCSD Chancellor William Mc-
Gill. 

Read will be a featured solo-
Ist along with flautist Nancy Tur-
etzky and violinist Christl von 
Wrocbem, in a performance of 
the Bach "Fifth Brandenburg 
Concerto." UCSD professor 
Thomas Nee will conduct the 
chamber orchestra comprised of 
members of the UCSD Music 
Department, University faculty at 
large and other guest artists from 
the San Diego community. Mr. 
Read will precede his perform-
ance in the "Concerto" by play-
ing four sonatas by Domenico 
Scarlatti. 

Farrell and Read together will 
perform "Suite in D Minor" by 
Marin Marais, the early 18th 
century.composer and solo gam-
bist to the French King Louis 
XIV. Assisted by Mr. Read, 

Farrell will also perform sel-
ections from Diego Ortiz, "Tra-
tado de Glosas" (1553), music for 
viola da gamba and harpsichord. 

Read studied harpsichord with 
Fernando Valenti at the Jun-
liard School of Music. Since his 
New York debut recital in 1963, 
Mr. Read has toured the U.S. 
and Europe as a soloist and as 
a member of the Kralnis Bar-
oque Trio. In 1964 he won an 
international harpsichord com-
petition in Munich, and in 1968 
performed the Bach "Fifth 
Brandenburg Concerto" with 
Herbert von Karajan conducting 
in Salzburg. Read performs on 
an instrument made to his own 
specifications by the firm Rut-
kowski and Robinette. 

Peter Farrell, Professor of 
Music at the University of Il-
linois, brings to his performance 
a studied familiarity with the 
traditions of viol playing, includ-
ing a reconstruction of the 17th-
century French technique of viol 
playing from contemporary sour-
ces, and a translation and com-
mentary on the Ortiz treatise, 
which deals with extemporised 
variation techniques for the viola 

third college representatives. 
Prof. Saville pointed out that 
there were no "substantive re-
solutions" passed. 

In a student meeting that im-
mediately followed it was in-
dicated that Chancellor McGill 
didn't respond once and that it 
was "a ritualistic meeting and 
didn·t cost them anything." 

The following resolutions were 
also passed at the Academic Sen-
ate Meetil1fz April 29. 1969: 

The Chairman of the San Diego 
Division is instructed to Invite 
the eight members of BSC/ MAYA 
who have been delegated to work 
with the planning faculty of Third 
College to attend the Academic 
Senate meeting of May 6, any of 
whom may have the privilege of 
speaking.

Arch 'e Shepp "A Revolutionary" 
Archie Shep, born in Fort 

Lauderdale, Florida in 1937, 
moved with his family to Phila-
delphia at age seven. There, he 
started the saxaphone at 15, and 
later played with Lee Morgan. 

He attended Goddard College 
(which "was looking for a Negro 
student to give a full scholar-
ship") where he majored in dra-
matic literature. 

Shep stated that his first real 
influence was Coltrane. He has 
cut several albums, on the Im-
pulse label, including "Mama 
Too Tight." 

" •.. you must Usten to me on I 
my own terms. I will not let you 
misconstrue me. That era Is o-
ver. if my music doesn't suffice, 
I will write you a poem, a play. 
1 will sa y to you in every instance 
'Strike the ghetto. Let my people 
go!' " 

"I play music out of an over-, 
whelming need to play; to make 
the rains come; to abOlish wars." 

"I play about the death of me 
by you." 

"The Black musician, "he told 
LeRoi Jones in a 'Down Beat'in-
terview, "is a reflection of the 
Black people as a social and cul-
tural phenomenon. His purpose 
ought to be to liberate America 
esthetically and socially from its 
inhumanity. The inhumanity olthe 
white American to the black A-
merican as well as the inhuman-
ity of the white American to the 
white American is not basic to 
America and can be exorcised. I 

think the Black people, through 
the force of their struggles are 
the only hope of saving America, 
the political or cultural Amer-
ica. JJ 

"Of his poem 'Malcolm, Mal-
colm--Semper Malcolm' (and 
musical composition): "( call it 
'Malcolm forever' , because of my 
belief in his immortality. I mearr 
he was killed but the significance 
of what he was will continue and 
will grow. He was, among other 
things, the first cat to give ac-
tual expression--though he didn't 
act it out--to much of the hostili-
ty most Blacks feel. ..... Malcolm 
knew what it is to be face less in 
American and to be sick and tired 
of that feeling. And he knew the 
pride of Black, that negritude 
which was bigger than Malcolm 
himself. There'll be other Mal-
colms." 

"This is a black music, it is a 
form that blacks have given to 
America ... have given to America 
..... out of love!" 

"Music must at times terrify! 
It must shake men by the throats. 
It must extol the inevitable tri-
umph of full stomachs and laugh-
ing babies. It must bring social 
as well as aesthetic order to our 
lives. Sometimes we must blud-
geon beauty to seeming death; 
make it ugly; simply because life 
itse if is at times ugly and painful 
to behold." 

His definition of Jazz: "Seil-
expression. And a certain quality 
of human dignity despite all ob-

stacles, despIte the enslavement 
of the black man and then his op-
pression. Each of the great play-
ers has had so distinctive" so in-
dividual a voice.There is only one 
Bird, one Ben Webster , one Coote 
WUliams. That's jazz-the unique 
ness of the individual. if he be-
lieves in himself,everypersonis 
not only different but valuably 
different." 

"The underlying symbolism of 
jazz has always been black, and so 
have been the great innovators. 
But jazz is accessible to all peo-
pie, if they're honest enough to 
receive it. It's all honesty that's 
not only necessary in jazz, but 
with regard to the most crucial 
problem in America--the racial 
proble m. Most whites have allow-
ed the relationship between the 
races to deteriorate, but there 
are some who are honest abOut 
what has to be done and who do 
see the need for profound and 
meaningful change in this country 
to end racism." 

Manilesto tor a New Black Music 

"It is our belief that jazz mu-
sical forms must be extended to 
meet an entirely new set of ar-
tistic, social, cultural and econo-
mic circumstances. It might 
seem strange to some to see the 
word jazz mentioned in context 
with such COld, hard realities as 
society and economics; yet it is 
undeniable fact that the veryori-
gins of the music itseU and aU 

its subsequent development was' 
rooted in societal forms. 

"The field holler, the spiritual, 
the blues, each served a definite 
function and grew out of very 
real, ver y painful experiences. 
We know today that the lyrics of 
the spiritual sometimes served 
as an alarm, a call to arms, or 
an angry cry to be done with suf-
fering and rid of the oppr essor. 
Much of the Blues is an extension 
of the argument. .. 

"Later on as musical instru-
ments replaced the human VOice, 
poetic directness and social com-
mentary began to give way to a 
"purer" musical form. This mu-
sical form developed at a much 
faster pace than the lyric. It was 
due in large part to the plasticity 
and ambiguity of notes over words 
that a folk art became transform-
ed into a national art and later 
into a universal art." 

" It was now possible for a lis-
tener to hear just the music with-
out the ambivalence that words 
elicit. He could identify with 
whatever he chose." 

"Thus the Black man (through 
jazz) has lent America a some-
what uneasy reprieve and, in the 
bargain, developed an art form 
which it could be said Is more 
nearly "American" than anyo-
ther. It is a know ledge olthe past 
and a precarious nationality 
which is the crux of our con-
sciousness." 

"For us, musicisfunctionalas 
we U as aesthetic. The artist pre-

sumes assess 
for allmen, to accept it , to re-
ject it. Both as men and artists 
in a complex, oftentimes grie-
vously unjust world we accept 
the challenge this society poses 
and project an answer through 
our music, one which sings a New 
America. We take our place be-
side those poets of the field. On-
ly the nuances of language have 
changed. The same essential 
longing for dignity over despair 
is still with us." 
Here's what Ralph Gleason, 

music critic for the San Francis-
co Chronicle and contributing 
editor, Jazz and Pop Magazine, 
has to say about Archie Shepp: 

"Archie Shepp is a revolution-
ary. just like John Coltrane and 
The lonious Monk and Miles Davis 
and Cecil Taylor and Lenny Bruce 
and Bob Dylan and Duke Ellington 
and Dizzy Gillespie and Stravin-
sky and Louis Armstrong ... As 
Brendan Behan said, 'the duly 
of the artist is to overthrow his

SHORTS 

Crew 
The Triton crew team won 

their match against UC Irvine 
last week. The lightweight fours 
and eights won their races for 
the Tritons. 

Tennis 
UCSD sent two singles players 

and one doubles team to the Ojai 
Tournament last week, as did 
all competing teams. This made 
for a stiffly contested tourna-
ment, each team sending only 
its best players. Singles pla-
yers Jim otvos and Steve Terre 
represented the team, as did the 
doubles team of Terre and Jim 
Hoffman. The only win was 
turned in by the doubles team, 
who went on to lose in the sec-
ond round. 

Gymnastics 
A second place on the side 

horse was the best VCSD per-
formance by the inexperienced 
gymnastics team in their open-
ing trimeet against Nevada Sou-
thern and San Diego state. The 
majority of the team was per-
forming in their first meet and 
did well considering. Nearly 
all are first year gymasts. Coach 
Stan Rose predicts a much better 
year with more experience and 
hopefully a few new incoming 
gymnasts . 

The team also competed a-
gainst San Diego state in a tri-
meet three weeks later. The 
showing was not as good as at 
Las Vegas. Several men were 
injured and a few missed their 
routines.

Triton Kickers Face 
Ensenada Again, 5-5 

Monday, May 5, at 5;00 p.m. 
the UCSD soccer team will play 
a rematch against the Instituto 
Marino of Ensenada. The last 
game against the Enser/ada boot-
ers ended in a 4-3 loss by the 
Tritons. 

Even though UCSD will have the 
home field advantage, they will 
be short on experience since 
three members of the graduate 
team who played with the var-
sity in the first game will not 
participate Monday. In the last 
few weeks, however, the Tri-
ton kickers have improved quite 
a lot so they should bequite 
ready to face the challenge posed 
by Ensenada. 

The starting line-up according 
to Coach Sarolli will be: at 
goal, Ned Newman, who wfll al-
ternate with Randy Kaul if he 
gets into trouble. Dan" Twink Ie 
toes" Schikele will dazzle his 
opponents with his fancy foot-
work at the right fullback spot.

The "Bearded Man," Bill Bar-
tels will be the center fullback, 
and Doug Smith, undoubtedly the 
most inproved player this year , 
will start at left fullback. 

The halfback spots are taken 
by two fighter s, Mike Harkey 
and Chato Benitez. The forward 
line will be composed of right 
wing, Rand Wilson, and left wing, 
F red Grunewald; at center for-
ward, Randy Kaul has drawn 
start ing assignments, it being 
his job to get the offense mov-
ing by setting up passes to the 
wings or inside forwards Steve

lie. 

The Ensenada team will bring 
along a cheering section of over 
sixty students which will greatly 
boost their morale. In order to 
counter this advantage, it is nec-
necessary that UCSD students 
support their team by coming out 
to the soccer fie ld, west of the 
gymnasium , at 5:00 p.m. this

AS Proposes Unique 
Student Center Plan 

On Monday, May 5, gTaduates and under-
graduates will determine the future of the 
UCSD student center. The student cente r 
concept is st ill nebulous and is still 
ver y sensitive to student suggestions, but 
if there a re to be funds available to fin-
ance the construction of the center, the 
students must agree to tax themselves, 
and they must agree now. 

Money for this project must initially 
come from a bond issue (now planned for 
tssuance in 1971-72. Tbe bond issuance 
is already planned, and If our student 
union Is to become part of It, we will 
need close to $300,000 by that time to 
qualify. Time Is therefore of the essence, 
and If the necessary 60 per cent of the 
students do not approve the tax by the 
necessary 2/3 margin , it will make con-
struction almost impossible. 

The following is a report submitted by 
the Student Cenler Committee in 1968 
which describes some ofthe services, !ac-
Uities, and environments which could be 
created in the student Center. However, 
there is still a need for student sugg-
estions as to what additional ideas might 
be incorporated. 
THE CLUSTER CENTER CONCEPT 

Three alternatives nave t>een presented 
in meeting the student center needs of this 
campus. One alternative was to develop 
a complete center for each college. This 
proposal has been rejected as being im-
practical since it would be twwo costly 
to build a facility on each campus in-
corporating all the functions desired. 

A second alternative was to build one 
student center to service the entire cam-
pus. This possibility has also been re-
jected since it departed dramatically from 
the college concept and was considered 
too costly to build and support with the 
student population projected for tbe near 
future. 

The third alternative, which was ado-
pted unanimously by the AS Survey Com-
mittee, is to build as many as three stu-
dent centers, one in each of the cluster 
centers to be developed on the campus • 
Tbe following reasons have been put forth 
in support of this alternative. 

(I) The cluster center would enhance 
rather than detract from the college con-
cept since its close proximity to each 
college would make it identifiable with 
the college and its facilities and accord-
ingly, could be easily used for college 
activities. 

(2) Based upon enrollment projections, 
the s tudent body could feasibly finance 
a cluster student center in the near future. 

(3) By locating the student center in 
the cluster complex it could take full 
advantage of the traffic generated by the 
other facilities In the area ali well as 
scheduling them for its programmed act-
ivities. 

(4) As smaller facilities, each built 
at different times, they could be easily 
altered and designed to meet the changing 
needs of the campus community, min-
imizing obsolescence and costly renov-
ations. 

(5) The cluster center would be large 
enough to serve as the focal point for 
campus-wide entertainment and activi-
ties not capable of being programmed In 
the colleges. 

(6) Colleges and universities across 
the country are finding a single campus-
wide student center Ie ss desirable than 
the development of satellite student cen-
ters. It seems that the finest facilities 
are not attractive to students unless they 
are easlly accessible . 

This project will provide desperately 
needed facilitie s in the areas of student 
cultural, social and recreational activi-
tie s which will not otherwise be pro-
vided on the campus. It is Imperative 
that we begin collecting the funds for this 
project Immediately If it is ever to be-
come a reality. 

FOOD SERVICE 
Several types of food service facilities 

are proposed for the cluster student cen-
ter. Each facUlty shall serve a spec-
ific need and Is in no way intended to 
dupUcate food services provided within 
tbe colleres. U the college food ser-

vice facilities are adequate in meeting 
the basic dining needs ot the campus com-
munity, the following student center fac-
ilities wo uld be sulficient: 

(I) Informal Snack Bar - A Mexican 
contina has been suggested by the stu-
dents as a motif capable of conveying the 
atmosphe re desired through the use of 
appropriate materials. i.e. , dim lighting, 
heavy furniture and booths,panitions,and 
a fireplace. Walled courtyards off the 
snack bar are also suggested for out-
side dining and relaxation. A small stage 
area is desired tor entertainment and a 
s mall floor area should be set aside for 
juke box dancing. 

(2) Banquet Facilities - Necessarykit-
chen facilities to serve two formal din-
ing areas are sugges ted. . The dining 
facilities should be capable of serving 
up to 200 people (total) for sit-down 
dinners (both banquet and restaurant ser-
vice), buffet luncheons, teas, and rec-
eptions, The dining rooms should be esp 
eciallyattractive in their appointments in-
cluding carpeting tbe floors. 
FORMAL LOUNGES 

Several small formal lounges should be 
located throughout the student center for 
lounging, quiet conversation, and reading. 
The furniture should be durable but soft 
and without an institutional appearance, 
The Survey Committee feels strongly that 
the center should convey an international 
theme with the lounges decorated in the 
styles of different time periods and of 
different nations . In doing so, it would 
provide a de finite break from the in-
stitutional trappings of the campus. 

It was also suggested that the lounes 
have different levels , possibly balconies, 
to help break the lounges down into the 
smallest possible number of private areas. 
These lounges are not to be multipurpose 
areas, nor are they reservable. One 
should be designated as a TV lounge and 
another as a piano lounge. 
MEETING LOUNGES 

Since most meetings held on the cam-
pus do not require conference-type fac-
ilities and are scheduled primarily in 
the evenings, the Survey Committee has 
suggested combining the function of the 
lounge with that of the meeting room so 
that the facility might be open for both 
study and relaxation when not reserved 
for meetings. 
.... 

MUSIC PRACTICE ROOMS 
At least two practice facUlties should be 

contained within the center. One room 
should be capable of accommodating a 
six to eight-piece banrl or choral group. 
A smaller room should be capable of 
handling at least three musicians. Each 
facility should be equipped with a piano, 
straight-back chairs, and music stands. 
Acoustics and sound proofing are cri-
tical considerations. 

Music Room - Attention is called to 
the Lincoln Center Music Library in New 
York. 
MUSIC LISTENING ROOMS 

Two music listening rooms equipped 
with high fifellty stereophonic equipment 
and comfortable furniture are suggested. 
These facilitie s are to be located close 
to the main desk for control and close 
proximity to the record library main-
tained at the main desk. Here too, sound 
proofing and acoustics are important con-
siderations.

SLEEPING CO'ITAGE 
The sleeping cottage will fulfill two 

purposes. Firs t, it would serve as temp-
orary housing for students and starr in 
searcb of permanent hou sing accom mo-
dations and secondly as a rest facility 
for commuter students who find it nec-
essary to stay overnight or rest between 
classes . 

The cottage should be designed as a 
dormitory facility, one for men and one 
for women, with seve ral sleepin! bunks 
located in one room and sharing a common 
bath. It should afiord maximum privacy 
and quiet away from the other activity 
areas of the center. 

One should be reser ved for visiting 
foreign students and faculty or other spe-
cial situations. Domestic student use 
will be permitted but with the under-
standing that foreign s tudents have first 
priority. 
CRAFT CENTER 

This facility will privide an oppor -
cunity for students to develop and use their 
creative talents in the areas of wood-
working, metalworking, ceramics photo-
graphic arts, and automotive r epair. 

This area would incorporate a common 
work center with work benches and open 
areas around which the work stations and 
rooms for the various crafts would be 
located. Special attention should be given 
to equipment se lection, lighting ventil-
ation, work flow, layout, and s~und and 
dust control.

areas. A work-in-pcogress storage r oom 
for projects should be easily accessible 
from the work center. 

The automotive repair area with a 
driveway access should be a covered out-
door facility adjacent to the craft center 
and its tool crib, with work space for 
at least four cars . 

The photography facility should emploY' 
the necessary light bames and provide 
four developing rooms and one printing 
space . 

The graphic arts area containing print-
ing, embossing, and etching equipment 
should be located in a dust free space 
off the common work center. 

The ceramics area should provid 
equipment for thrown and s lab proj c s 
wd a kiln to accommodate several pro-

jects. 
The woodworking and metal working area 

should contain a basic compliment of power 
and hand tools with appropriate bench 
space in the common work area. 
AUDITORIUM-BAL LRooM 

This facility should be a large multi-
purpose room with a maximum seating 
capacity of 600- 800. This facility should 
be flexible enough to be divided into two 
smaller rooms capable of being used sim-
ultaneously for different programs. Stor-
age space for staging, folding chairs, and 
other equipment should be locatd adja-
cent to the facility. A complete sound 
system capable of handling all types of 
events should be Included in the design. 
A pcojection booth and sc reen should be 
a part of the facility. 
CO FERENCE ROOMS 

At least three conference rooms cap-
able of accommodating 20 people around 
a confe rence table and a larger audience 
around its walls are sugge sled . The lar-
gest of the three should have a tota I 
capacity of 75 people. A blackboard and 
projection screen or wall should be avail-
able in all conference rooms. 
RECREA TlON-GAMES AREA 
The following game facilities are sug-
gested for this area: 

(1) Billiards (pool) - 12 tables 
(2) Pingpong - 4 tables 
(3) Bowling center - 8 alleys 
(4) Ample floor space available for 

other games 
In addition to the ga me facilities list-

ed above, a control center for issuing 
eqUipment and supervising the area is 

esse~tial. Locker storage for the bowl-
ing area is also r equired. Proper sound 
profflng and location of the ga. mes area 
in relation to other facilities Is critical. 
INFORMATION AND RECEPTIO AREA

Open Letter to UCSD 
As a group of concerned students who have had an opportunity to take 

advantage of the intercollegiate athletic program at UCSD, we feel an 
obligation to reply to the pl'oposals of a group of UCSD athletes (T. T. 
Apr. 25 "Athletes Present Demands, Threaten to Boycott Teams", and 
today's letter from Mr. Meister). 

We disagree with the philosophical approach to intercollegiate 
athletics implied by the demands and we disagree with the methodolOgi-
cal approach which assumes that a limited preferential/rmancial aid 
to athletes program can be controlled. 

Philosopliically, Mr. Meister and these athletes state that inter-
collegiate athletics provide an opportunity for mercenary athletes 
"to represent us in the field of athletics" (Mr. Meister's words). 

On the contrary, our perception of intercollegiate athletics at 
UCSD has been that they provide an opportunity for UCSD students 
to become involved in a meaningful experience. The more professional-
ized our program becomes, the less chance the average student has 
to involve himself in a unique and meaningful experience. 

Mr. Meister talks about a petition circulated last year calling for 
the establishment of a "representative" intercollegiate football team. 
The signators of this letter Include three of the five students who 
initiated the petition, and the AS senator who made the original pro-
posal to the AS Senate. 

Our intent when we circulated the petition was to establish a team 
on which interested students could participate, not watch! We wanted 
to play on the team, not pay professionals to come and play for us. 

We have a unique intercollegiate athletic program at UCSD in which 
the average student (not just O. J. Simpsons) can participate. We 
feel this unique situation Is worth preserving. 

Our critique of the methodology is addressed specifically to the 
proposal (which Is the issue of the referendum in the May 5 election) 
concerning financial aid to athletes irrespective of their need. 

There has been an attempt to establish an elaborate series of 
guidelines to assure academic community that the aid program can 
be controlled. These assurances overlook two important facts. 

Once the principle of enticing athletes to come here with monetary 
awards has been established, the amount of these awards is logically 
dictated by what it costs to produce a winning team. One does not 
invest $500,000 in a program in the hopes of producing competitive 
teams and then scrap the $500,000 investment if it's not enC'ugh to do 
the job. 

Finally, we cite the evidence of the expe r ience of every college and 
university in the country. We have yet to find an example of a "modest" 
financial aid program which has been sucessfuUy controlled. 

We therefore urge all graduates 'and undergraduates to support 
the present athletic policy which does not permit preferential financial 
aid to athletes. We urge you to vote no on preferential aid to athletes 
on May 5. 

We do, however, urge increased funding for facilities and coaches 
under the present athletic policy.

Candidates forLower Division Senator 

Bor"en Core' 
There are three issues that the students olUCSD 

are facing taday. These are Lumumba- Zapata Col-
lege, recruitment, and subsldaUon of athletics. 

(I) I am completely behind Lumumba-Zapata 
College, and if elected, will try to make this Into 
reality. 

(2) I am for having any recruiter on campus that 
has a moral job to offer a student here at UCSD. 
The Marine 's are an immoral organt,zation, and be-
cause they do not agree with the idea of a universi-
ty, should not be allowed to come here. I am also 
prepared to back the majority of the students on 
their opinion concerning recruitment. 

(3) I am against athletic subsidation because such 
a program would be impossible to control. 

(4) I am for more communication between stu-
dents and student representatives. At the present 
time, I am the student representative on the Aca-
demic Seante's Academic Freedom Committee, 
and yet no one seems to know, or even care! 

Any questions concerning the above statements 
may be addressed to me either over the phone 
(453-5575) or in my room (Argo 522 .). 

Pau' Kaufllan 
The effective power of the Associated Students Is se-

verely limited by a shortage 01 funds. I am therelore 
convinced that the AS must become financially indepen-
dent before the student body can enjoy maximum repre-
sentation. As the situation now stands, the purse-strings 
of the AS are subject to administrative supervision. 

Making student government financially independent would 
eliminate the need to charge the present quarterly fee 
of $6, and would enable students to lead a decisive role 
in school affairs. 

I. Lumumba-Zapata College: I strongly Cavor the es-
tablishment of a program of ethnic studies at UCSD, 
and firmly believe in the prinCiples which LZC repre-
sents. 

LZC is of course, only a partial answer, but it consti-
tutes a step in the right direction. Realistically, how-
ever, certain aspects of the Third College need to be 
re-examined with greater care and forethought. 

2. Athletic Demands: Inter-collegiate athletics is, in-
deed, an integral part of university life. The whole in-
tention of the program, though, was to give students pur-
suing intellectual courses of study an opportunity to ~r­
ticipate in inter-collegiate sports which would be demed 
them if UCSD specifically recruited athletes. 

Certainly, a P.E. major would mean sacrificing aca-
demic standards. But, I do think a number of the de· 
mands advanced by our athletes are fair and should be 
met. 

3. Recruitment: If we deny freedom ' of speech to 
military recruiters, we must simultaneously withdraw 
the privilege from business interests to solicit on cam-
pus. 

We must be careful not to "emasculate" the univer-
sity in the process of keeping it "untainted" by ques-

'Uonable infl,uences. The problem is complex and needs 
more analysis. 

Stephen Carpenter 
As lower division senator I will act as the represen-

tative of the freshmen and sophomores ol UCSD, not as 
an individual in office without regard for the views of 
the people I represent. 

The key to this is, of course, active student partici-
pation in the government of UCSD and I shall encourage 
this by assuring that all pertinent information is at the 
lower division students' disposal and that they have suffi-
cient opportunity to express their viewpoint. 

To see that this vital feedback is maintained, I intend 
to talk on a regular basis to as many of my constituents 
as possible. 

Lll rnoon ..... . Lower Division Senator Athletic policy: I do not support financial aid tor 
athletes as "athletes". Beini on one of the intercolle-
giate athletic teams is not the highest achievement a 
student can make--it is only one possibility out of many. 

There is no reason to discourage private donations, 
however, if all fields of endeavor are represented equally. 
All students would thereby benefit from the increased lunds , 
not just a few. 

I do think that time spent voluntarily in such ways 
should be recognized, in that some credit should be ex-
tended to athletic courses, and proceeds raised by the 
athletes should be used in the athletic department. 

Lumumba- Zapata College: I fell that the BSC-MA YA 
gene ral plans for the third college represent a great 
opportunity for the minorities in the Un ited States and 
would be a truly great experiment. 

I would not like, however, to see the enrollment limited 
to a few, rather all groups should be represented. More-
over, L-Z college should not have any power over or pre-
ferential treatment over the other colleges. 

Recruitment: There should be open recruitment on 
campus or none at all. 

la'ph Taylor 
This is a stahlment concerning thi issulls that are 

being discussed during this ilection. 
Concerning the Lumumba- Zapata College proposal: 
1. I support the basic fundam nlals of this propo~l 

desiring that they will become a reality. 
Concerning Military or any other form oC recruit-

ment and coercion within the university community: 
1. I am opposed to this typi ot immoral influencQ 

among us. 
2. I would like to study the possibilities of bringing 

more moral influences among us. 
Concerning the demands of the Athletes: 
1. [ feel that they are hiing discriminated against 

by the non-athlete types, and should be allowid to prove 
what advantages and disadvantagis an escaJated intercol-
legiate sports program might hold. 

2. " The addition of a physical education ma jor to the 
curricula oC tile 3rd college • •. " would help many Negro 
and Spanish American students at the Lumumba-Zapat.a 
College to get the jobs they also req'lest. 

Concerning the Cood se rvici: 
1 will support student controlled food se rvices to 

eliminate legalized rackets and monopolies. 
Or: 
I will support mandatory food fies which would ,mabie 

a student to buy his own food elsewhere to insure 
P K f Lo decent food for meals. , ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• ~qJ au man, wer Division Senator 

Jim Magill F or U ppe·r···DrvIslon···Sen·~·t·~·~························ ····j·i;·S"iii~·· 
The ASUCSD over the past year has grown at an ama-

zing rate. From a sma ll organization sponsoring dances, 
it has become a small corporation supporting many campus 
operations and representing the' student body. The growth 
potential ot the ASSOCiated Students must be continued. 

The Program Board will be providing over $60,000 
wnrth of activities during the next year. There are plans 
{or a student run gas station on campus and a discount 
book and record store. 

But what doe s all this growth mean for the students? 
The eventual outcome is the elimination of lees . Even-
tually the AS will be self-supporting and possibly even 
incorporate as UCLA has done. But only with student 
support can these programs be implimented. 

The student center is one of these programs that mllst 
be initiated. It can and will become an integral part 
of the campus. 

My views on some of the issues raised by students 
during this election are as follows: 

1. The question of military or other recruitment on 
campus hopefully in some part will be resolved through 
the AS poll. I believe it comes down to a question of all 
or none. 

2. On the question of the BSC-MAYA proposal for the 
third college, the general program is highly agreeable 
but some of the specifiCS must be cIarified to gain the 
student support it will need. Hopefully, the discussions 
daily will solve this. 

3. The question of athletic grants must be studied more 
intently as to what the students of UCSD want and how 
intercollegiates relate to the university. There must 
be more control factors bullt into the program or the 
system escalates too rapidly and out ot proportion hurting 
the overall program. 

The present Senate began last year energetic and respon-
sive to the students. Over the last few months It has 
deteriorated into a meaningless debate session. TheSenate 
must once again be restored to the legislative vlace it 
represents in our student government. Only through 
esponslblUtyand Interest can this occur. 

Jim Sills, Upper Division Senator 

1. Associated Students' eJo.1l9nditures printed each two 
or three months in student newspaper . A complete finan-
cial r eport. 

2. A new report on athletic subsidization byacommittee 
composed of faculty- students-athletes to clarify the facts. 
This committee would seek out the facts and make their 
findings public. Then, when the facts are known, we may 
draw our separate conclusions. 

I have heard conflicting reports about the athletic de-
partment's motives, their present procedures, and other 
important questions, making a rational judgment difficult 
if not impossible. In any case 1 do not believe there 

. should be any change in athletic subsidization without 
the agreement of a majority ofthe students in a referendum. 

3. Open and free recruitment on campus including mili-
tary. I believe any lawful employer who might hire any 
UCSD students should be accomodat d. 

I' m sure you share my belief that thIS "generation" 
will avoid many of the mistakes mad by past generation. 
If you do you w1ll not want to make the mistake of letting 
prevailing political opinion on campus (against Vietnam 
war) limit per sonal prerogatives. 

"Open" recruitment has been determlne110cally by the 
Academic Senate, which ha.s strongly endon:ed it. "Open" 
recruitment has also won the approval of the American 
Civil Liberties Union. 

A certain section of the San Diego community showed 
Its lack of objectivity by demandin!' thP Nlmnv~l nf Pl'f'1 
Marcuse on political grounds. Let 's show the wor ld we 
can be objective, and at the same time back up local coun-
cils like the Acad mic Senate. 

4. ProtecHon of UCSD from force from wlthin or with-
out the academic community. This to be accomplished 
by taking care of our own problems through due proces. 
Let th clta I of reason, the university, set an example 
by ruling itself through reason.

BENJAMIN·PALCIC PLATfORM 
As tbe only candidates with previous A S. experience, Senator and Co!fee Hut co-

ordinator, we submit the following platform: 
In many areas our administration willcontinu43 intbe direction establisbed by programs 

initiated by the pr'H.!' lt arlm irJl;;1 r.1! iOll, the most pr0<1t1~l lv43 In UCSu's history. 
Thes~ :l-~ail inc lude elCplll1~jo'l I)~ "1 ~ A.S, into t;'t ll.1I1<;·' ·V: 11) food service tuncl.ioJs 

for both better food and lower cost to students; continuing investigation of and, if 
possible, initial implementation of a financial program designed to provide low cost 
services to students in form of co-ops of various kinds and discount record services, 
and make belter use of student monies through investments. 

We wUl also expand A.S. operatio:ls: in student transportation, a study will be made 
of low cost bussing to north county. We will make the radio station a viable communi-
cation before the end ofthe quarter or terminate its operatio.1, continue an A.S, commnnity 
affairs committee, and continue our present investigatio:l Into such noncommunicat!ve 
organizations as the Campus studies Institute. 

Furthermore, wa will work toward a better understanding with the Board of Rei9nts 
and the Governor's office to establish the leiit!lMcy ot a student voice In the running 
of the university. 

In this area we propose to initiate a universIty-wide coordinating body whIch wUl 
be a focus of student opinion on university matters with which we must be concerned. 
On this campus we wUl establish the post of full time A,S.-Regent liaison. 

Along this same line, we propose to formll at.e plans for an Academic Union composed 
of the associated students, graduate students, and the Academic Senate, which can 
realize the Ideas of the real academic community for the running of the university. 

In addition WfJ hope to expand the number of student member committees in all campus 
functions. 

In the area of extra curricular activities, OJr admin istratio:l can provide low-cost, 
high-quality rock concerts tor UCSD students only and leave the public, profit-making 
ventures to the more sedate Glenn Yarbrough type events. Also we will present an AS 
film series of important new films to supplement the present Mllir film series running 
every week . 

We turn now to the three major campaign issues: 
Third College: We fully support the BSC/ MAYA pro;>osals for the Third College. 

We feel that they are totally compatible with the original general proposals submitted 
by Dr. Rappaport last year. There could be no better community orientated college 
(as proposed by Third College staff) than that proposed for Lumumba-Zapata College. 

The A.S. could become effectively involved in this pr06ram by sponsoring tutorial 
and counseling services, which UCSD students could partiCipate in -- perhaps as part 
of a project major for high school students from the so-called "disadvantaged" schools. 

Athletics: Because 0: past examples of the inability of universities to effectlvely 
control lull scale athletic programs (whether "big-time" or not) once they are Inftlated 
and because recruitment of athletes wlil necessarily limit the chances of the average 
student to participate in intercollegiate sports, we are opposed to any aid for athletes 
above and beyond that given to any other students. 

We are not opposed to interco~leglate athletics, we have both pal'ticipa~ed 0.1 UCSD 
teams. We are not opposed to the use of university and stUdent monies for the con-
struction of athletic facilities for the use of all students, such as in intramural pro-
ifams , but if such facilitie s are funded with the intentio;) o~ usage for subsidized inter-
collegiate teams, the time which they wHl be avatla'>le for general student use will 
be considerably less. 

Recruitmpnt: We believe that the use of the Placement Office for the recruitment of 
military officers is Inconsistant with the academic function of the universIty. While 
many of the corpora~lons which engage the Placement Office 's servic~s are inti-
mately cOtulected with the military, we see some difference between their position and 
that of the military itself. Therefore we would support the results of the A,S , po!l on 
recruitment by corporations. How'Jver, Wf! feel that It is most importa1t to realize 
that the issue 0: free speech Is a specious one ( see the AS information pamphlet) 
and is only a dodge away from the real issue, which is whether or not the university 
should serve as man-power/brain-power pool for the military. We believe that it 
should not.

RITTER-ERICSON 
PLATfORM 

This is not our platform due to space limitations. 
We would like, however, to make a non-platform 
statement Instead. 

Randy Erickson and I are what could be called 
political opposites. We view this as strength rather 
than weakness because, on the other hand, we are 
functionally co-operative. When a problem arises 
that we must face together as friends, we Inevitably 
produce th~ best possible solution. Sure, we haggle; 
we explore each other's mind and heart to find just 
the areas we are willing to compromise and the 
degreees of passion with which some areas are em-
braced and no signs of compromise exist; then we 
conclude a compatible, plausible, and, therefore, re-
sponsible so lution. As a team we enjoy the benefits 
of internal compromise. This internal compromise 
is what we offer to you. 

We fe el that we Interpret the offices of president 
and vice-president differently from other candidates. 
Ideally, there Is a substantial number of able s tudents 
willing to work on committees, provide public re-
lations, and engage faculty and administration In 
meaningful and constructive debate. On our campus 
this is especially so ••• when the lines of communica-
tion are open. 

When students are passionate enough to demand to 
see the Chancellor, we think it is the president's 
job to open new means of real communication. We 
would never pretend to represent the BSC or YAF 
or anyone else; our job is to make it easier for 
BSC and YAF to represent themselves clearly and 
exquisitely. 

UCSD is a pluralistic community and no two people 
can represent all the sides. But as President and 
Vice-President of ASUCSD we have the power al the 
representative s of the students to build a structure 
with which any Individual student or student organiza-
tion dedicated to an idea will be able to expre ss that 
Idea and have it attacked and defended in front of the 
people who are empowered to act and inact that Idea. 

• This Is our proposItion, and we are dldicated to it. 
Please help us and help yourself.

CHARLES CHONG 
I have no infention, whatsoever, of being elected. 

] am runnIng for the sake of running as a diversionary. 
Therefore, I will not be inhibited about using deep out-
field tactics, such as shouting and screaming, waving 
my hands and jumpIng up and down. 

I think that outside academic areas the people of thi s 
institution are deluded by one tblng or another. Un-
fortunate Iy, ODe thing or another comprise only two, 
too few alternatives for an Intellectual center such as 
the university. 

As a diversionary I wlll try to divert [or a few micro-
seconds people's attention away from their great gloried 
pursuits with the hope that maybe they'll be able to 
see things and people around them and, peculiar Iy enough, 
maybe themselves, 

I will not hesitate to admit my ignorance of the 
popular issues which have pervaded this campus as the

Tom Peifer for Reyelle Senator 
] am running for election to the Student Senate, as 

Revelle College Senator. As a Revelle student for the 
last two years, and an AS Senator for the past year, ] 
am aware of the issues confronting the students. As a 
candidate running for reelection, I must speak openly 
on these issues. 

Many students yearn for a change in existing ad-
ministrative policies . Perhaps the most conspicuous 
example of this is the controversy over Armed Forces 
recruitment.. The Placement Office is run by student 
money, and exists, we are told, to benefit the stUdents . 

For this reason, the will of the s tudent body, as shown 
by the forthcoming referendum, must be acted upon. 
While] oppose military recruitment on campus, I will 
work to implement the recruitment policy which is 
endorsed by the students. 

] support the BSC and MAYA demands lor Lumumba-
Zapata College. I think that these demands must be 
acted upon immediately by the admInistration and the 
Provisional Faculty of the Third College. Negotiations 
must be begun. 

But the students cannot allow these negotiations to 
drag on endlessly, to accomplish nothing, and to pacify 
us until summer. The pretext of working through the 
proper channels can never be thought to outweigh or 
permitted to eclipse the rights of students and especially 
minority students to establish an education re levant 
to their lives and their futures. 

The unique athletic program at UCSD provides an 
opportunity for students to participate in Intercollegiate 
athletics. I support this concept and will work to 
continue this policy and make it better for the students 
which it benefits. 

However, I oppose the subsidation of athletes and 
grants-In-ald, as they constitute a completely different 
type of athletic program which would harm the academic 
environment and not only the academic environment of 
our community. 

These, ] feel are the issues, and I have candidly given 
my beliefs. My concern is with studen t power. Power 
to innovate and change, to build a re levant education 
for a meaningful future for ourselves and for the good 
of all mankind. 

year. Next, 1 feel that ] am the most qualified persor, 
to hold ' the office since I was head cheerleader this year . 

Many people say that this year's cheerleaders were not 
very good, but many people do not r ealize that we started 
from scratch and we got a great many things accomplished 
even though it did not seem like milch. 

Next year I would like to try to get as many people 
interested in athletics as possible, build more school 
spirit and more enthusiasum, and less apathy. After all, Cheer- those boys out there in athletic fields, gymnasiums, and 
pools, all represent UCSD. If we get behind them with 

for 

le'ader a word or two .of ,encou rage~ent, that could be the differ-ence between wlnnlDg and los mg. 
I'm goIng to lay a few facts on all of you about head-

cheerleader and why I'm running for the office. To 
begin with,' this is an office that was ju s t created this 

I would like everyone to know that I am always open 
to constructive criticism and suggestions and would appre-
ciate both if they will lead to a better cheering squad.

CANDIDATES FOR MUIR SENATOR 
fd Magnin 

Wow! You're probably \/ondering why I decided to run 
for the office of Muir college representative to the AS 
(Well, even if you're not wondering I'd appreciate your ' 
reading the rest of this brie ' statement). 

During the past year I've attended quite a few of the 
Senate meetings (I might say quite a few more than any 
of my opponents, with the exception of Steve Ishmael, 
who is the incumbent) and I wasn't satisfied with where 
our $18,000 a quarter was going. 

I saw many special interest clubs come in and ask for 
large sums of money from the AS, and in many cases 
get a good portion of what they asked. 

If [had been a voting member of the Senate this past 
year, I would have tried to limit all AS appropriations 
to things which would benefit the whole student body of 
our school and not just some particular club or interest 
group. 

On the other issues that come up throughout the year, 
such as recruitment, athleUcs, and the third college, I 
will try to be motivated by student polls, which I would 
encourage as often as seemed appropriate. 

Finally, if you have any questions which I have left 
unanswered, please feel free to come by and talk to me 
at upper right Ogden Hall (Room 636). 

Marl flson ' 
We must confront a situation that imposes itself upon 

us and explore the potential for effective social change 
and the role of revolution as a means to that end or as 
an alternative to it, if indeed it has a role at all. What 
the progressive students throughout the country have so 
far accomplished has been to show their unity and their 
power in that unity. M 1r Se t t Lar 

I see our function as bringing to America' s conscience Leonard Bourin, u na or a ge 
the educational and social problems that have been swept 
aside so long through half-hearted attempts to solve na-
tional problems of which few have been resolved. 

Different tactics may be used, but we must use always 
the most effective one for the proper situation. The most 
effective action at times might even be ( and has in fact 
been) to act " outside the established channels of grievance" 
only after they have proven unfruitful. 

What we must combat is appeasement, being provided 
with toys, bread and circuses when far-reaching changes 
must be made. We must continually ask the question, 
" what is being done with our minds?" This is our goal--
the liberation of the mind of lIl3A. 

Recruitment: Edueation is no longer merely participation 
in the class, but includes political activity. I am not In 
favor of Marine recruitment,but the most effective action 
possible must be taken as regards this, as with all other 
political action. A coalition of all facets of the demo- Mark Elson, Muir Senator at Large 
cratic left, not just one segment of it, must decide the 
proper action. 

Athletes: The top priorities on this campus are not 
and should not be in athletics. There should be not pre-
ferential treatment for athletes as far as subsidization 
goes; financial need and equalization of minority group 
status should be the criteria. 

Lumumba-Zapata: A commitment should be made to the 
minority community. It should be a planned venture, 
and not merely tokenism. I would like to see white 
students exposed to the type education proposed by 3SC-
MA YA, for they need to know about it more than minority 
students do. 

Steve Ishmael

page of Presidential P Uorms 

Leonard Bourin 
1. I feel that the BS~MA YA proposal for Third 

College is a concrete plan for implementing the fund-
amental changes in the educational structure which are 
necessary. The proposal must not get bogged in what 
is called rational discourse but which only means talk 
and no action. The proposal is criticized because it 
would give preferential treatment to minority students, 
but that is exactly what is necessary. In other words, 
the classical idea of equality is invalid here because 
it would only breed more inequality. 

2. The issue of recruiting is not one of free speech, 
recruiters do not come on campus to address themselves 
to the issues which their agencies or companies raise. 
The placement center Is run with student monies and 
the students must decide who is to use the center. 
Personally, I feel that military recruitment should not 
be allowed on campus, because of its use of the coer-
cive draft system as a means of recruitment, and the 
fact that these agencies by their very actions deny 
these rights. 

3. I favor an intercollegiate athletic program, but 
I have to oppose subsidatlon of athletes as a special 
group. I don't feel that they have suffered four hundred 
years of discrimination and therefore require pre-
ferential treatment. 

4. I support the efforts so far made by the ASUCSD 
to expand the AS food services and hope that eventually 
the AS can take over all of the food services on campus. 

5. I support all efforts to make the AS self-sufficient 
with the hope of eventually abOlishing the compulsory 
AS fee. (e.g. student-run discount record store). 

6. I will work toward the regular publication of an 
evaluation of professors and courses. 

7. It is the responsibility of the AS to keep the stu-
dents informed. This includes the use of the campus 
media, publications, rallies, and mass meetings. 

Robert Munl & Roger Showley 
Next year, UCSD will be engaged in the final formative 

stages of Cluster 1. We will acquire our new Muir campus, 
and it is imperative that we take significant steps towards 
the realization of our plans for Muir College. We must 
move towards our goal of a true academic community 
through proposals along the lines of SSC-MAYA's Third 
College plans for academic reform. 

In our hopes for UCSD's AS this next year, we look for 
the laying of a reliable toundation for the classes of the 
70's to build upon. No longer can we sit idly by as change 
in Sacramento or Berkeley forces us trom our inertia. 

Our AS elected representatives must learn to lead their 
student body beyond the petty Issues that otten occupy 
hours ot senate time. To these ends, we offer these means 
to success: 

1. Academic reform: Major reforms are necessary if 
we are going to realize our goal of a true academic com-
munity within Muir College. Along this line, we support 
the theory of the BSC-MAYA proposals tor Third College, 
and would do anything possible for the implementation of 
as many of these as is realistically possible. 

Another Important reform which we will urge is the 
initiation of a pilot program aimed at including students 
in the decision-making process involved in selectingfaculty, 
courses, and goals in their respective disciplines. 

2. AS Adjustments: Students have the right to know 
what their government is doing and how their money is 
being spent. More feedback from the students is necessary. 
We would make the present system for student introduction 
of matters for the AS Senate's consideration easier, and 
would make these meetings and their results more accessible 
to the student body. 

Our ever-increasing size calls for an expanded Triton 
Times and a viable radio station that covers UCSD and 
reaches beyond the campus. Review of the AS Constitution 
to make it a meaningful and workable document is essential. 

Also, despite the presence of extreme views on any 
issue on campus, we deserve a truly intellectual dialogue 
on all areas of concern, and the AB should promote this 
dialogue by providing re liable information on current 
issues and by arranging discussions with both sides of 
a question pre sented. 

We would push for the creation of a faculty guide as 
a means for students to communicate their reactions to 
specific courses and faculty members, and a student's 
guide to UCSD, including campus bureaucracy, short cuts 
and shortcomings, as well as information on the surrounding 
community. 

3. La Jolla-San Diego programs: We have already 
established a program to bring the universityandcommunity 
close r together. We hope to replace the presently available 
"physical plant" tour with one including visits to classes, 
person-to-person discussions with students, panel dis-
cussions with students, faculty and adminstratlon, and a 
more meaningful look at UCSD and the UC system. This 
program has been in the planning stages for the past 
quarter I and Is scheduled to start next fall. 

4. Recruitment: We favor open recuitment; it is not 
for us to decide a moral issue by a vote. We must recon-
cile the moral Issue of the Marines with the need for open 
recruitment. 

5. Athletics: The Justification tor the demands of 
the athletes is false. Subsidization or financial nid should 
not be selective for athletes. We can support some of 
the demands; expansion of the athletic program is needed, 
but not "big-time" athletics. 

We are running together because we have agreed on 
these basic issues. If elected, singly or as a team, we 
pledge our dedication to these programs. Of course, as 
there is strength in unity, the Implementation ot these 
progr- ms Is much more probable It both of us are elected.

CANDIDATES FOR REVELLE SENATOR 
Michael Caruso 

I will refrain from making any general introduction 
except to state that I am earnest in my desire to represent 
the students of Revelle College in the capacity of AS Senator. 
The following constitutes my platform for candidacy: 

1. I favor and strongly recommend that the AS Senate 
assume the responsibility tor existing and future snack 
bar facUities. I feel that in doing so the AS would become 
self-supporting and thus not only provide reasonable food 
service but also increase the capacity of the AS to better 
serve the interest of the student body at UCSO. 

2. I favor the idea of a Third College, within the uni-
versity structure, devoted to the studies of minority cul-
tures as a step in the elimination of social inequities. 

However, I believe that some of the demands as stated 
in the pamphlet "Lumtimba-Zapata College: BSC-MAYA Fred Greensite, Revelle Seoator at Large 
Demands for the Third College at UCSO" need revision. 
Among these are the demands that the work force and 
personnel involved in constructing the Third College be 
completely from the minority community and the quota 
system which limits the percentages of minority and white 
students. 

These, I feel, are dIscriminatory in their very nature, 
which Is a contradiction of the idea of the Lumumba-
Zapata College. 

3. I favor open recruitment on campus. It ls an in-
fringement upon the right of students who may have an 
interest in this area to be deprived of recruitment pre-
sentations on campus. 

The way the system at UCSD is currently structured, 
I can't go along with the demands of the athletes. The 
study aspects of the university are more important, and 
I am against expanding the program. 

Ed (Ned) VanVallenburg 
Marine Recruitment: I am against Marine recruit-

ment for the following reasons: 
I) Marine recruitment is not compatable with the 

educational philo~oI>hy I)f. the university. 
2) The university should not be the labor pool for 

institutions which engage in genocide. 
3) It certain government funds havll clauses necessita-

ting military recruitment though unrelatert to the funding, 
we should work to end such extortion. 

Lumumba-Zapata College: I agree completely with 
the black-brown propo,;;.l, 

t) They are in agr"Jp. ment with the original general 
purposes of tll~ Third College. 

2) The majority of the students must be aware of the 
pt'oblems to be studied and must be dedicated to return 
and work in their commllnity. Thus, to be effective, 
the student and faculty population of Lumumba- Zapata 
College must be black and brown. 

Athletic Demands: I find sevllral .) f theSp. demands 
objectionable due to their restriction to athletes. 

1) I feel that no studenl, with financial need, should 
work during the school year for less than the nniversity 
pay s~al~. 

2) Waiving of incidental fees should include all stu-
dents with financial need. 

3) Better food is a necessity ,Justifiable for all 
students. 

I agree with the following ideas put forth: 
1) Procf'eds from ticket sales, food concessions, 

etc., at athletic events should go into a fund for ath-
letics. 

2) Independent donations to the athletics department 
for sports should be acceptable. 

Concerning Food Services: I feel that the students 
have been continually abused by the present dorm 
contract which includes food. I feel that a contract 
either including or excluding tood should be oHerred 
to the resident students. A cpntract without food in-
cluded would encourage better food and more reasonable 
prices. 

Bruce Morden 
I believe the AS should serve the students. The AS 

should be responsible for pl'oviding services to the students. 
This means further expansion of AS activities. 

This includes: 
1. The extension of an AS office to Revelle, bringing 

the business of the AS closer to the students of Revelle, 
2. The completion of negotiations and extabl1shment of 

AS run food facilitie s at Revelle, SIO, Matthews and Muir, 
3. Utilization of the. communication capabilities of the 

Triton Times and KSDT to inform students, faculty and 
administration as to the activities on campus, 

4. The improvemllnt of KSDT's programing and enlarge- Cindy Nielsen, Hevelle Senator at Large 
ment of the listening area, 

5. Expanded student representation on academic and 
administrative committees. 

The principle means of acomplishing these goals is 
not through protestation but through existing channels. 
This means more communication between students and 
adminlstration. With this increased communication between 
students arid the AS and between the AS and the faculty-
administration, we can in itiate programs which allow greater 
student infiuel\ce on the university community. 

I am committed to this increase of responsible student 
power. It is this method by which the students can modernize 
the university by working within existing channels to increase 
the relevancy of the system to the individual student and 
the surrounding community. . 

During the 1967-68 academic year I was one of the AS 
Elections Commissioners. This year I have been the 
president ot the UCSD Soaring Club. From thl!i position 
I have been working with ths AS and the administration Bruce Morden, Revelle Senator at Large 
through committees and direct confrontation. 

fred Greensite 
1. Since any private business running the cafeteria will 

try to make every cent of profit possible on the students, 
and the students pay for this in quality or quantity of food, 
the present company running the cafeteria should be kicked 
out when its contract expires, and be replaced by a student 
run cafeteria. 

2. The bookstore should be run on a nonprofit basis 
with all books sold as close to wholesale as operating 
costs permit. Like UC Santa Cruz, we should have a 
record store selling records at virtually wholesale price 
for students. 

3. Since UCSD has no program in Black Studies except 
for history majors and since we are required to take 
six quarters of exclusively western culture (Humanities), 
we should incorporate a black studies program in the 
Humanities sequence. In addition, I support the AS Senate 
resolution on the Third College. 

4. It is the students' right to revoke the Marine Corps' 
privilege of recruiting (which is not an exercise ot free 
speech) on campus. We should have a referendum on 
this Immediately. 

5. Athletes should never receive preferential treatment 
in disbursement of scholarships or jobs. Athletics at 
UCSD should remain an extracurricular hobby. 

6. I favor the establishment of a committee to be named 
the Campus Studies Institute 's propagandizing activity, 
organization, membership, and financial backing. 

I Mile Harle, 
I see an atmosphere in this<lUliversity and across the 

nation of growing frustr~tion. I see us, the country's 
future leaders, lost in a vague ideological dream of what 

, the world should be like. Iseea massive, kicking, scream-
ing tantrum going on because some of us can't seem to 
bear the frustrations of working toward that dream. .. ow" 
Is the time. "ReVOlution" is the method. 

I truly believe that it is an outspoken minority that 
believes that threats, profanities, and WIysical force are 
the best tools for improving the world. I want to represent 
those of you who are level-headed and mature enough to 
see that dreams must be tempered with the hard facts 
ot reality before they can be Cully realized. 

I strongly support the devotion of the Third College 
to minority studies. The lack of such a curriculum is 
a socio-economic deficit to the minority groups of the 
community as well as a gaping hole in our educational 
system. However,] feel that many of the demands of 
the Lumumba-Zapata College must be revised if it is 
to be accepted by the Board of Regents. 

In the pursuit of true academic freedom, I support open 
recruitment on campus. We can't close our eyes to the 
influences and opinions of any side of any issue. That 
inc ludes military recru itment. 

I feel that the demands made by the athletes must be 
voted upon by the student body. If the majority wants 
to recruit a team, then let's do it. If not, then the athletes 
have no right to make such demands. 

I want to see much more communication between th!! 
student government and Its constituents. If the senate 
is to represent the student body at all, it must obviously 
know what the students want. I propose that student 
opinion polls be taken on all major issues and activities 
related to the senate on a monthly basis. 

Cindy Nielsen 
Senator Responsibility: As Secretary of the Associated 

students ' Senate for the past two years, I am familiar 
with and have been involved in many campus issues and 
A.S. programs. Most importantly, ] recognize the need 
for senators to accept responsibility for making the Senate 
an active and effective body. 

Senate Efficiency: Sending a bUl to committee for further 
action or discussion means much of the groundwork is 
done previous to Senate discussion. This is necessary 
in order to make the Senate meetings productive. As a 
senator, I would take responsibility for carrying out com-
mittee action when it is called for. 

Campus Issues and Relevancy of the Senate: The A.S. 
Senate should be active in the many campus issues in-
volving administration of the campus. Often the students 
are ignored. One method of insuring student represen-
tation Is by AS representatives taking an activ and vocal 
part in Academic Senate and Chancellor's committees. 

AS-Student Communication: Communication between the 
AS Senate and students should be increased particularly 
by making available an advance agenda for meetings so 
that Interested students could attend the meetings and pre-
sent their opinions. PubliCity for campus events should 
be increased. 

Snack Bar FaCilities: The senat.! will be responsibl 
for an effective administration of th sna<k bar faciliti s 
at Revelle, Muir. the Basic Science Bulldilg, and Scripps, 
which has already been arranged. This proj ct if done 
correctly would provid for an increaseo and superior 
food service. Also the AS should take responsibility Cor 
improving contractor-run eating faCilitie s. 

Campus Recr uitment: I believ til o:>t!lIale ::.IIUlIlO r -
cognize the poll concerning campus recruitment as being 
the opInion oC the students and act to initiate plans coin-
ciding with and enforcing this opinion. 

Lumumba-Zapata College: I support the Id a ota college 
which emphasiz s minority studie and th use of a unique 
system of government based on student-facuIty-admini tr _ 
tion cooperation. 

Athletic Policy: Currently there is no need for ath1 tic 
scholarships. Developing th recreatlonal program is 
more Important.

E~ 
Are You Uptight? 

Brace yourself for more of the same garbage you've heard umpteen 
times before, because we're going to urge you to vote in the election 
on Monday. But perllaps if you'll bear with us a little and think about 
wyat we're saying you won't tlUnk it's just so much garbage. 

Most students by now are veterans of numerous amateur political 
campaigns, at tile university. high school, and even junior high scllool 
level. However, the dWerence this year is that it really does matter 
who is elected and what direction the AS will take next year. It becomes 
important each year, perllaps exponentially so (to put in terms that 
Revelle migllt understand) as the power and the potential for power 
increases. 

Power might be a bad word though; perhaps opportunities for 
participation is a better phrase to use. The fact of the matter is 
that the areas in which the AS exerts influence and promotes stu-
dent participation have increased enormously during the Shepard ad-
ministration, and it is vital that the new representative carryon in 
this tradition. 

Whether or not you agree, however, that increased AS influence can 
ultimately be tile most effective means for furtllering a legitimate 
student grievances, you ought to recognize that you will inevitably be 
effected in some way by their activities. In fact, some of those who 
might yell the loudest when they are directly effected during a crisis 
situation tend to be the most apathetic voters. 

The Marines came on campus to recruit men for the war in Vietnam. 
Were you uptight? Several students prevented tile Marine from entering 
the placement center. Were you I1ptight? The AS Senate of last year 
had recommended the policy of open recruitment that Murphy was 
trying to enforce. This year's Senate has explored the possibility 
of establishing legal grounds for selective recruitment. Does this 
rub you one way or the other? 

UCSD's football team was beaten by Cal Tech this year. Were you 
uptight? The athletes want subsidization. Are you uptight? It was 
representative appointed by the AS who brought the issue out into the 
open. Are you glad? 

Tom Shepard spoke to and with the Regents in the name of the UCSD 
student body several times this last year. Was he representing you? 

Last but not least, the AS spent $60,000 worth of your hard-earned 
(?) cash this year. Did you get your money' s worth? 

If you can honestly say that you are not concerned about the war in 
Vietnam, racism, money, faSCism, sports , education, or music, then 
don't vote on May 5. But if you are then vote and vote intelligently. 
Consider not only the specifics of the candidates' platforms, but also 
the amount of dedication and hard work the candidate will put into the 
job, for in the long run that might be the most important factor. 

&dttM~ 
Keep Policy Selective 
An of ten-heard objection to the action taken by the Marine protestors 

last quarter has been that they purported to act in the name of the 
university community, or at least that was the impression given. 
In a previous editorial we pointed out that this was not at all their 
intention, but, be that as it may, the students of UCSD have a chance 
to express THEIR real feelings concerning military recruitment in 
an opinion poll that will be conducted simultaneously with the AS 
election on Monday. Those who always say that they agree with cer-
tain goals but disapprove of means used to reach them, now will have 
a chance to prove their real dedication to these goals. 

In other words, the opinion poll allows those WilD have had certain 
reservations about the tactics used in the Marine incident to join 
in an overwhelming show of solidaridy of the student body, demon-
strating oppositio to military recruitment of any shape or form. 

To those who still have lingering doubts about the alleged free-
dom of speech abridgement involved in a selective policy of recrult-
migllt, it might interest them to know that the current policy by which 
the placement center is operated is in fact discriminatory. 

The following is the official policy followed on this campus to 
deter mine who shall use the place ment center. 

CRITERIA FOR ON--CAMPUS RECRUITERS 
Any primary employer who: 

(a) initiates a request to come to the campus; 
(b) offers lawful and remunerative employment opportunities to 

graduates; (c) does not discriminate on grounds of sex, race, ancestry, color, 
national origin, or religion; (d) hbnors negotiations and committments made to University 
graduates and alumni. 

The employment of tht;!se criteria would destroy the myth that there 
is currently a policy of "open" recruitment. We leel that the above 
four criteria are actuall y ample to exclude the military from the cam-
pus. An especially st :ong case can be made from (c). It is a fact 
that the proportion of backs and other minorities in the Armed Ser-
vices is far greater than their percentage of the over-all population. 
Furthermore, certain p~cUist religious groups, such as the Quakers, 
are excluded (they are g ven CO's). 

Is the Marine Corp oUering "lawful emploYliiEnt opportunities?" 
The War Crimes Tril.unal, organized by Bertrand Russell, ruled 
that US actions 10 Vietl am were in direct violation to the Geneva Ag-
reements of 1954. Mal y nations and statesmen have charged tllat the 
US is violating international law in the military policy it has pursued 
not only in Vietnam, but tbroughout the world. 

Enforcing (c) involv~s a subjective judgment by someone. If the 
administration of the university is not prepared to make that judgment 
then the students better, because it's they are the target of recruit-
ment. ;md the service is provided for them. 

F lDall';, if the present four criteria are not enough, a vital one 
coulrl he atjr!ed: 

(e) is r.ompatable with t he educational philosophy of the university. 
ill con<:lusion, the issue at stake is not as simple as "open" or 

"closptj" recruitment. Currently there is a selective policy. What 
must be determined is how selective the policy is to be. If you feel 
that the restrictions should be extended to include the military, then 
we would recommend a "yes" vote on part " d" of the opinion ",,1 •

FALL QUARTER · · · Persona'lities and Protest 

As UCSD students returned to campus 
after summer several signs of change 
and growth were evident. Perhaps the 
most obvlot!s ;was that there were simply I 
a lot more people around than ever before. 
Both Revelle and Muir Colleges had ad-
mitted almost full-size freshman classes, 
and tbis influx put such a strain on the 
facilities that in the dorms many fresh-
men were faced with the unpleasant pros-
pect of baving to triple up. 

The campus itself was growing, too. 
lle gymnasium-nIltatorium complex had 

y opened near the end of the pre-
VIOUS year, but now it was complete and 
tte new Muir complex mushroomed to 

north. The Medical School, just south 
d the Matthews Campus was- nearly fi-
. hed and its ultra.-rllodern multi-tiered 

itoriu'hl .was being used for several 
ergraduate classes. Furthermore, 
struct ion soon got under way for the 
re UCSD library. 

new food system 
~nother change that was surely of 
~rest to dorm residents was the s ns' 
fead system. The Hi-Continental Company 

replaced the unpopular Prophet Corn-
y, and over tbe summer the "Schultz 
, had become a reality, although in 

s ewbat alteroo form. Instead of the 
" -you-call-eat' free-for-all that had 

the focal point of a march on the 
cattteria by commuter students the year 
be~tre, tllere were the transferable cou-
po~. Although it was generally agreed 
t the quality of food increased, prices 
we: high enough that many studens 
hal to budget their food intake. 

eld,.idge Mer 
so new at UCSD was Chancellor 

W' . m McGill--not new to tbe campus s, 
for he had even been Chairman of the 
A emic Senate the previous '/ear, but 

ne\l~' tbat capacity. He assumed office 
in ce of Dr. John S. <A.lbraith, who 
res ed the post to accept the Smuts 
Vis . g Fellowship at Cambridge Uni-
veri ty in England. McGill approached 

hiS~ less with the attitude of a pro--
fe s nal administrator than as an idealist 
who ould rely on the abUlty of a "com-
murly of scbolars" to deal rationally 
with their problems. However it was 
not ong before tbe Chancellor was in-

volv~ in the several controversial issues 
that aced the campus during the year . 

chancellor mcg;' 
The first controversy arrived, as a 

matter of fact, during the first week of 
the Qilarter when Eldridge Cleaver, a1-
ready the center of attention in the state 
as a result of his participution in So-
cial Analysis ·139X at Berke ley, spoke 
to a capacity crowd in the UCSD gym. 
An u~tlght community was up in arms, 
but severat YAF pickets and a few ci-
tizens who left the lecture ear ly didn't 
prove to constitute much of a problem. 
Furth,rmore, McGill agreed to pet TNC 
handle hhe security measures , and police 
were blumed. alttJough it was reported 
that allple numbers ~re stationed neary. 
The inc<>ming fresbmen class was given 
a crash CQUrse in political awareness 

as Cleaver called for "power to the people 
and led students in the " Ronald Reagan . 
cheer. ' 

There were several other speakers of 
considerable significance during the Fall 
quarter. During orientation week, Father 
Blase Bonpane, who had been accused of 
"plotting 'an armed revolution in Guate-
mala and forced to leave the country, 
criticized the foreign policy of the US 
in Latin America, asserting that ths policy 
of containment of communism which is 
pursued shows no understanding of the 
real problems of Latin Americans. Pro-
fessor Harry Edwards, formerly of San 
Jose State, and an organizer of the Black 
boycott ot the Olympic games, issued 
a call for a new Black identity to counter-
act the white radsm which pervades the 
political, social, and economic policies in 
this country. 
Tranh Van Dinh, ambassador to the United 
States from Vietnam, told students that 
a true revolutionary must have a poli-
tical base and must be non-violent. 

David Harr is, currently serving a jail 
sentence for violation of Selective Service 
laws, exhorted students not to deal with 
the draft machinery by trying to get 
deferments , but to refuse nto cooperate 
completely by turning in their draft cards. 

george wallace 
Then there was another speaker who 

didn t appear on the UCSD campus proper, 
but who had arun-in with a quite sizeable 
contingent of UCSD students who went to 
hear him. The national presidential 
Campaign was still underway during the 
early part of first quarter, and George 
Wallace, candidate for the American in-
dependent Party was speaking at the San 
Diego Sports Arena. Employing reverse 
tactics that had the eUect of confusing 

Wallace and ultimately making it nearly 
Impossible for him to conclude his re-
marks, students cheered wildly for the 
Alabaman and carried such placards as 
"Freaks for Wallace,' am "Wallace is 
our Guru. ' Huntley.Brinkley acknow-
ledged the s~ess of the demonstrators 
which led Walltce, once Ile ~ht on, 
to threaten: "You're from the Univer-
sity ot California, aren t you? ... l'm going 
to come back to California and you just 
try me then. ' 

Wilen t1le national election finally ar-
rived early in November the scene on 
campus was strangely incongruous. While 

~ Jolla voters cast their voted quietly 
m the South Dining Hall, an official 
~recinct for the area, TNC held a rally 
m the Revelle plaza to voice their elec-
tion protest. A larger rally was to be 
held in Balboa Park, but a questionable 
restraining order issued against the use 
of sound-amplification by "all unrecog-
nized pOlitical groups' spoiled these plans 
and led to picketing of the San Diego 
Police Department by some 150 TNC 
members, 

CIS fee refer ... d_ 
Turning to campus politics, several 

students had initiated a move at the end 
of the previous school year to end com-
pulsory AS fees. The AS Senate, upon 
presentation of the appropriate petitions, 

set a date (or the electlon. 11 seems that 
alt~ students had voted in 1965 by 
four to one margin to initiate this fee, 
no such provision had ever been officially 
included in the constitution. Now, a con-
stitutional amendment was devised, and the 
chancellor specified that a 60% vote would 
be necessary in order for the results 
to be binding. In the confusion that 
followed the turnout fell far short of this 
mark although those in favor olthe amend-
ment to retain AS fees ran about 80%. 

colege goVetJIIIlent 
During the quarter the constituents of 

both Muir and Revelle college attempted 
to form viable college governments. Re -
velle had elected six students the pre-
vious year to join three faculty members 
and three administrators in the formation 
of a Revelle College government. They 
began work on a constitution which was 
to be presented for ratification later in 
the year. 

Muir College was not as far along as 
Revelle. The status of a provisional 
government that had been former! thp year 
before was foubtful, and an attempt was 
made to convene a Muir Bill of Hlghts 
Convention. This attempt was interrupted 
by the Regents meefing and no further 
action taken in this regard until later in 
the year. 

regents meefing 
The major event of the Quarter re-

volved around the activities that occurred 
before, during, and after tbe Regents 
meeting that was held on the UCSD cam-
pus in November. The AS Senate began 
an educational campaign well in advance 
of the meetini, aimed not only at informing 
the students concerning the Regents, but 
deciding what action could be taken. In 
these efforts the AS Senate was joined by 
an ad hoc committee of faculty members. 
Together they planned a silent protest 
demonstration that was to take place out-
side tlls gym as tlls Regents entered 
Friday morning (Novem~r 22). This 
rally, and {lthel' statements issued before-
hand were to make clear opposition to 
tlls Regents prior ruling limiting guest 
lecturers to one appearance, as well 
as a more stringent resolution that had 
been proposed by Governor Reagan at tile 
previous meeting. It was felt at the time, 
that a repititlon of the Santa Cruz meeting 
in October, when Regents had been jos-
tled and jeered, would not he lp influence 
the Regents they Were aiming their effort! 
at. 

silent protest 
Tile silent demonstration was notenough 

for many students. More than 150 white 
students accepted Israel Chavez' plea to 
join BSC and MAYA in a hunger strike 
until Reagan's resolution was defeated. 
This strike proceeded for nearly thre(' 
days, althougb given little publicity b' 
the local pr e s s. 

The silent demonstration can only be 
said to have been successful, although its 
intended effect may not have been. On 
a campus with a student popUlation (in-
cluding sraduates) ot only 3600 police 
estimates of the cX'Qwd that tur'ned out 
Fciday morning were 1500. The spec-
tacle of that many persons standing in 

almost total silence was a visible sllock 
to several Re&enta as they <1isembarked 
from their (:Jrs. 'FIle meeting, which 
had beell moved from the Chancellor s 
Conference Room to tile gym largely 
throgh the efforts of AS President Tom 
Shepard and Chancellor McGill was 
viewed by 500 spsctators, and fe~ dis-
ruptive incidents occurred. Thestudents 
merely filed out of the room once a mo-
dified resolution was passed that cesulted 
in Reagan withdrawing his original pro-
posal, although ahout 100 students marched 
blck to the gym shortly after tbe meeting 

had ended chanting "Cleaver, si, fRe_ 
- gents, lto.' 

convocation 
Perhaps more significant was what 'oc-

curred in the aftermath of the meeting. 
students meeting in the Blake Hall Lo~ 
over the wee kend 1;3 1; 'd a convocatiop for 
Monday, and a caucus of faculty mem\lel'lJ 
meeting Sunday nigbt agreed 10 cancel 
their classes for Monday. The convo-
cation continued throughout Monday aiil 
Tuesday on the theme: "Tile university 
is dead; long live tile university. " Late 
Tuesday afternoon, after an emotional ad-
dress by a Revelle senior, about 150 
students moved en masse into tbe Hu-
manities Libr~-ry, USB 2722, and tile 
HL Aud, attempting to gather support, 
Chancellor McGill made an unscheduled 
appearance in the plaza finally, engaging 
in the discuss ion. I 

The culmiRation of this activity came in • 
a special meeting of the Academic Senat~ 
Ileld near the em of the quarter. Several ./ L 
resolutions passed at that session ex-
pressed faculty disapproval of recent 
Regental action. The facIlItY also approved 
a mechanism for initfating new courses 
of social concern, and approved a course 
on Rac~Sm to be held in tbe Spring 
Quarter. A further outgrowth oftbis period 
among the students was tile formation of 
CPE, Center for Participltory Education, 
which, like its counterpart at Berkeley, 
exisls soley for the purpose of involving 
students in their education. 

The Quarter ended with many students 
in a position that was tobecomeacommon 
one throughout the year. Atter nearly 
10 days of frenzied activity it became 
inevitable tbat tile quarter would pro-
ceed to its normal conclusion after all, 
am many found tbemselves burriedly cat-
chini up in preparation for final exams.

~~~~~~--~~~~~~~------------------------~~..e~-------------WINTE QUARTER··· Universi Under Fire 
During the winter Quarter the status of the con-

troversial world-famed author and philosopher 
Dr. Herbert Marcuse came to a climax. Copley 
Press and the American Legion had waged ex-
tensive campaigns against Dr. Marcuse while 
1000 students signed a petition supporting his re-
hiring. Marcuse, who is past the mandatory re-
tirement age for university professors, had to 
have his contract renewed on a yearly basis. 
The ultimate decision rested with Chancellor 
William McG111, although legally the Board of 
Regents could have overruled him. 

As for the criterion being used to judge Dr. 
Marcuse's qualifications, McGill contended that 
they were purely academic. The main Question 
was whether or not he is "active Intellectually" 
and the political situation "would not prejudice 
his decision In the slightest." 

The San Diego Union emphatically stated that it 
"opposed the rehiring of Herbert Marcuse, be-
cause he was unfit to teach, and his rehiring would 
not serve the people of California .• ." 

Chancellor McGill announced his decision to 
rehire Marcuse Feb. 16, but extended "the cour-
tesy of allowing the Regents to review his decision." 
As :l result, Assemblyman Jotm Stull called for 
McGill's dismissal and testified before the CEP. 
stull stated that the Regents had been receptive 
to his demand to fire Marcuse , and somewhat 
less so to firing McGill. 

McGill was criticized by some students for 
keeping his decision ambiguous for an extended 
period while trying to please everyone and for 
failing to exercise the authority granted him. 
McGill defended his decision by claiming that 
he wished to create an air of rationality at the 
tau~egents meeting. He felt that the action he had 
a croken would be advantageous in his presentation 

T.{I the Regents. 
- With an atmosphere of massive police violence 

directed at the Berkeley students outside the 
building, the Regents, by a narrow margin of 
votes declined to intervene in the controversy. 

more spealers 
The Winter Quarter also revealed a host of 

speakers on campus--this time without much 
conflict, as was the case in the Cleaver instance. 
The San Francisco State Strike objectives were 
explained to a UCSD audience by a student and 
professor Involved in the strike. The Teacher's 
Union wanted to force the state to collectively 
bargain with State College teachers and to cause 
a "resolution of student grievances." Ira Sand-

pearl, long a close political associate of, Joan 
Baez, also spoke here. His basic message was 
that "the worth of an Individual transcends the 
right of the state to take his life." Ries Lopez 
Tijerina, fresh from a startling victory In a New 
Mexico court battle, visited our campus to give 
an account of the Brown view of America and of 
his battle to secure land rights for his people. 
Tijerina contends that Anglo-America has tried to 
"melt" everybody's culture Into English, and the 
result has been the suppression of minority culture. 

The role 01 the scientist in society was also a 
major issue during this quarter. Norman Cousins, 
editor of the Saturday Review magazine and presi-
dent of the United World Federalists, also spoke 
on campus. Having played an important role in 
achieving the nuclear test ban treaty, he em-
phasized the need for world peace and the control 
of technology. 

spotlight on scientists 
Along this line, a UCSD professor of physics, 

Dr. Herbert York voiced opposition to the con-
troversial ABM system at a senate hearing In 
Washington. Along with its paramount cost, the 
technical and political proble ms involved In de-
ploying the missile system would actually lessen 
national security, he contended. York was also 
part of the nationwide protest by scientists March 
4 against the use of government funds for research 
that develops modern arms such as the nuclear 
missiles and ABM. 

Another scientist at UCSD, Linus Pauling, an-
nounced his resignation in March to go to Stanford. 
Dr. Pauling, twice Nobel Prize winner, said In a 
statement concernLJg his decision to leave: "Among 
the factors involved I may mention the present 
uncertainty about continued financial support olthe 
University of California and about the division of' 
responsibility for staff appointments between the 
faculty, and presidents and the Regents.' 

orr draws fire 
One controversial speaker, our own economics 

professor Dr. Daniel Orr drew a large audience 
to hear about "Neo-Marxist Dogma". Presenting 
a sort of apology for the capitalist structure, his 
lecture dealt with what he felt was lacking in 
Marxian economics and presented a rebuttal to the 
traditional Marxian predictions concerning the 
historical progression of capitalism. In the heated 
Question and answer period afterwards, Marcuse 
refuted his lecture, respoooing to Orr's criticisms 
of Marxian theories and predictions. 

captain stout 
A career with the federal government came 

under dramatic fire here during this quarter. 
Not only were there pickets denouncing U.S. 
Imperialism on Federal Career Day, but also a 
crowd of students and professors prevented a 
Marine recruiting officer from entering the place-
ment ottice. Captain David Stout had come to keep 
his scheduled appointment on Feb. 21 at Matthews 
Campus, Building 250, to disseminate information 
and meet with Interested (?) students. Stout found 
himself outnumbered by some 50 students clustered 
around the steps, although probably only 25 actually 
participated in physically blocking the entrance. 

As a result of their actions several students 
became liable to disciplinary action for their 
violation of a university policy of open recruit-
ment. Dean of Student Affairs George Murphy 
reported of complaints from several members of 
the academic community and became involved In 
verifying, the names of those involved. The con-
troversy carried over the Spring Quarter with 
discipline aimed at "the UCSD eight." 

athletics exami..." 
Also during the Winter Quarter, the future role 

of the athlete at UCSD came to critical attention. 
The athletic department has been pushing to join 
the California College Athletic Association, which 
would involve intercollegiate competition In an 
established league of colleges. To implement this, 
they also desired to embark upon a program of 
athletic subsidization. A committee appointed by 
Chancellor McGill to formulate an athletic policy 
submitted a consensus report that called for a 
moderate athletic policy, with some subsidization 
of athletes. However, a minority report expressed ' 
a categorical opposition to subsidization In any 
form. 

The Triton Times expressed an editorial opinion 
that once a university commits itself to big time 
athletics, expecially football, it embarks upon a 
road 01 no return. "It Is our belief that a program 
of athletic subsidization would ultimately be harm-
ful to a campus with the academic quality of 
UCSD." The P.E. Department pointed out such 
problems as coaching and scheduling with other 
schools, but felt that a moderate program of 
intercollegiate athletics, In conjunction with a strong 
program of intramural and Intercollegiate sports, 
would be a "healthy approach." 

IIIUir coleI' coup 
Late in January, a coup of sorts, was pulled ott 

by the Muir College (Dorm) Presidents Council 
when it declared itself to be the student govern-
ment of Muir College. Last year, Muir set up a 
provisional government consisting of committees 
charged with various functions. This was dissolved 
near the end of last year and ettorts to convene 
a Bill of Rights convention in the fall faUed, partly 
through lack of student participation. 

Val Quoidbach, the nominal head of the orm 
counCil, and several others became impatient and 
took the matter of establishing a viable Muir 
government into their own hands. (At stak is a 
sum of money alloted to a Muir College government 
by the Vending Machine Committee.) 

Problems such as "aparthy" and lack of com-
munication with commuter students probably make 
the PreSidents' Council a more viable access to 
students through the dorms than any other Muir 
organization. Indications are that the council w11l 
assume maily an advisory role In Muir College 
affairs to become a vehicle through which the 
energy, ideas, and Imagination of students may be 
tapped.

---------------~~~--~ SPRING QUARTER · · · Attempt · to C0l!lmunicate 

Third quarter got ott to a fast start 
and ran hard ' for the next ten weeks. 
Professors, stumbling and blinking In the 
harsh sunlight, emerged from their labs 
a met a new form of lite: the student. 
students In turn started a movement 
christened a new college, and generally 
talked about a lot of issues. The ad-
ministration paced in their offices, 
ministration paced In their offices clu-
cking softly and humming "We' Shall 
Overcome.' The San Diego community 
and press contiued to rage at unseen 
but dreaded academic monsters, while the 
Citizens to End Campus Anarchy waited 
in their cellars and knitted cartridge 
blndoliers. 

lumumbo-zapata college 
Simmering right at the beginning was 

the controversy over Third College. Alter 
sollcitlng proposals from the Black Stu-
dents council aoo the Mexican-American 
Youth Association, Provost Armin Rap-
paport and the Provisional Faculty for 
Third Co])ege started on the long r~d 
to the Registrar's office. The propo-
sals of BSC-MAYA asked that "the Third 
College be devoted to relevant education 
for minority youth and to the study of 
the contem(lOrarf social prob!ems of alII 
people." 

They went on to demand student re-
presentation on a Board of Directors which 
would control the college , that the col-
lege enroll 35% black students und 35% 
brown students, that admission to the 
college be dete rmlDed by a committee 

controlled by minority , and tbat 
the curriculum emphasize minority pro-
blems as well as the usual college sub-jects. . 

The reaction to these demands was 
mixed. Most students didn't even know 
they had been made. The administration, 
led by Chancellor McGill, was cautious. 
McGI11 approved many of the principals 
underlying the proposals but refused to en-
dorse them because they were written In 
Inflammatory language. Discussions then 
began between BSC-MA YA, the admin-
istration, and representatives of Third 
College to clarify the demands. 

Discussions continued for several weeks 
amidst increasing controversy, BSC-
MAYA charged that the Third College 

representatives were indiffer~nt to their 
proposals and that the administration was 
negotiating in bad faith. Representatives 
of Third College and the administration 
responded with statements called for con-
tinued discussionsaoo expressing the hope 
that Third College would not be down-
graded academically. 

These discussions broke down and a new 
negotiating committee was created. Con-
sisting of eight faculty members from the 
Provisional Faculty and eight students 
from BSC-MAYA, this group began its 
discussions with the Board of Directors. 
Although negotiations proceeded smoothly 
enough, final _recommend,ations for the 
Board of Directors were approved by only 
two faculty members and it became ap-
parent that faculty members were troubled 
by the proposals. 

The Chancellor's inauguration had a 
definite effect on the academic commun-
Ity: all classes on that day were can-
celled. More to the point, however, It 
provided San Diegans with an opportunity 
to visit "Berkeley Sough." The profes-
sors turned out In their finest plumage 
and everyone listened tCi speeches by 
Pres. Hitch and Chancellor McGill. At 
the end of the ceremony, McGill, pre-
viously only acting chancellor, was of-
ficially issued his dog tags and flak jacket 
and sent back to Hamburger Hill, Camp 
Matthews. 

,aleeover of 
registrar's office 

The next arena of confrontation was the 
Academic Senate. The Senate was con-
cerned over the allocation 01 teaching 
positions, which under BSC-MAYA's pro-
posals would be made to the Board rather 
than to the departments within the college. 
At its meeting on May 7 the controversy 
came to a head. 

BSC-MA YA representatives ', who had 
negotiated with the understanding that 
Senate approvul of the rllsults of tbe 
negotiations would be a formality, were 
angered to find the Senute debating eoo-
lessly about the college. They proposed 
tbat a new committee with real power be 
set up but the Senate seemed to ignore 
thsm. Frustrated at Senate inaction, the 
students walked out of hhe meeting aDd 
took over the Registrar's office in pro-
test. 

The action was taken by 52 students 
and lasted about 80 minutes. Wormed of 
the action, the Senate moved to consider 
several resolutions on the floor. They 
passed the Veron resolution, which called 
for a new negotiating committee to be 
set up with members favorable to the 
principles underlying LZC, and after being . 
informed of its passage the students left 
the building. 

Tbe new committee qas promptly es-
tabUshed and drew up proposals for 
LZC. The Berkeley situation blurred 
the results mf tbese negotiations, how-
ever, aoo it appears that the committee 
will have to scramble to finish its work 
before hbs end 01 the CJlarter. 

Venlitt it r .. 
Waiting for Chancellor McGill in his 

attlce was the ghost of February 21. 
On that day a group of students bl<,lcked 
the entrance to the Placement Office to 

. prevent a Marine recruiter from con-
ducting interviews. 

Eight students were identified by Dean 
of Students George Murphy and their 
names were turned over the Student-
Faculty Committee on Student Conduct. 
Its hearing into the incident started In 
mid AprU aDd cootlnued for several weeks. 

The students eventually admitted that 
they had been present on the steps and then 
launched into a defense of their actions. 
They contended that recruitment for the 
armed forces was Incompatible with the 
University's function as an educational 
institution, and thus they should not be 
found gu11ty of violating any rules. 

The committee found different. Although 
sidestepping the issue of whether mili-
tary recruitment is a proper part ot the 
University, the committee did recommend 
that the Chancellor put the students on 
probation tor a year. The Chancellor 
agrreed with the committee and the case, 
.thought not the issue, appears settled. 

A.S. Becfioas 
So~ehow the campus found time to elect 

its otf1cers for the next year. Sophomore 
Jett Benjamin beat out a field of four 
other candidates to secure the presidency, 
while his running mate Mike "Heavy 
Palcic won the vice-presidency. Jim Ma-
gill was elected upper division senator 
and Paul Kaufman was elected lower 
division senator. 

Cindy Neilsen, Bruce Morden, and Tom 
Peifer were elected Revelle senators-at-
large and Leonard Bourln, Steve Ishmael, 
and Mark Elson were elected Muir sena-
tors-at-Iarge. Art Lujan was elected Head 
Cheerleader as about 33% of the students 
votl!d 1n the election.

of being a moderate and apathetic campus, 
although this was effectively dispelled 
later in the year. At that meeting Regent 
Pauley introduced several resolutions that 
would limit the power of the Chancellors 
in making appointments to professors, 
over-age included. Also, Regent Canday, 
wbo had been reading the UC campus 
newspapers diligently, was not at all

difficult for the Regents.

gents criticized an agricultural budget that 
devoted only 0.6% of its expenditure to 
the migratory and small-scale farmers. 
He also made this memorable quote during 
the debate on the People's Park: "In the 
long run of history, flowers are always 
going to win against fences and students 
are always going to win against old men!" 

So much for the summary of Regental 
action this year. A special session was 
called this week of the Committee on 
Grounds and Buildings to deal with the 
proposal of the Berkeley city council to 
lease half of the university property known 
as People's Park; the Regents will be 
holding their next regular meeting in two 
weeks at the San Francisco Medical Cen-
ter and will meet twice more over the 
summer before the next scbool 

Having personally experienced four Re-
gents meetings during the course of the 
year, and having closely followed the 
proceedings of the others, I would like 
to make some personal observations (end 
"objective" reporting, begin editorial 
comments). What was indeed significant 
this year, as much as Reagan may deny 
it, was that the university did indeed 
become involved in politics, deeply and 
perhaps irreparably so. 
, This is not to say that it wasn't before. 

But, this involvement widened and be-
gan more blatantly obvious in the sessions 
of the governing board of the university, 
the UC Regents. The proceedings of the 
past year were a study in a group of men, 
some struggling to reconcile whatever 
allegiance they had to the idea of aca-
demic freedom with the terrible political 
hot-seat they found themselves on, while 
others Uke Reagan felt no such contradic-
