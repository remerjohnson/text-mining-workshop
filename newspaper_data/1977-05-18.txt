PaneIOK's Student 
Unemployment Law 

by Hugh McIntosh 
Staff Correspondent 

SACRAMENTO-A bill designed to encourage employers to hire 
students for part-time or surruner work was approved Wednesday by the 
Assembly Ways and Means Committee. But the bill would also restrict 
the ability of students to collect unemployment insurance (UI) benefits. 

Ryer: S. Africa "Very Racist" 
The Ways and Means Conunittee voted 14 to 4 to send the measure on 

fO.r consideration by Ute full Assembly. The bill, AB 28, is sponsored by 
DlXon Arnett (R-Redwood City). 

A recent court decision has convinced many employers not to hire 
students for part-time or surruner jobs, Arnett said. They fear that as a 
result of Ute decision, students will now be able to claim benefits based 
upon these jobs. A large nwnber of such claims would raise the UI taxes 
paid by employers, he said. Assistant Chancellor Feels More Exchanges Needed 

by Laura Richter 
StaHWriter 

Assistant Chancellor David 
Ryer returned from his recent trip 
to South Africa (Triton Times, 
April 13) wiU. an impression of a 
"very complex, very racist society 

David Ryer 
which is oppressive against non-
whites." 

Ryer, part of a three member 
team organized by the Institute for 
International Education (ITT ) and 
financed by a grant from the 
Department of State, said the 
purpose of the trip was to explore 
the possibilities in higher 
education programs for South 
African blacks coming to the U's. 

From the trip it became clear to 
Ryer that the blacks they met with 
would welcome more educational 
opportunities outside of South 
Africa and the team "concluded 
that more aggressive exchange 
programs to effect social change 
should be considered." 

The question of how many ad-
ditional exchanges would be 
allowed by the South African white 
apartheid government was 

unanswered. " It's my guess that if 
you'd ask them, Utey'd say no," 
concluded Ryer, but the team 
neither asked the government nor 
"could figure out how to tell." 

Ryer's trip spurred opposition 
from some sectors of UCSD, in-
cluding the National Student 
Coalition Against Racism (SCAR), 
which called the move "a slap in 
Ute face of the UCSD community." 
Ryer responded by saying "No, 
I'm not a racist," adding that he 
viewed South Africa as " probably 
Ute most racist society in Ute 
world. For non-whites, it's a vir-
tual police state." 

An "Old, Old" Conflict 
Anthony Ngubo, Assistant 

. Professor of Sociology, currently 
(/) teaches a course called "South g African Society" at UCSD, viewed 
eli Ute present racial conflict as "an 

~ old, old confrontation that has 
£ become more urgent and ex-
&. plosive. " Ngubo said that the white 
I: government persists in denying 

basic human rights to 80 percent of 
Ute population whose "main fault 
seems to be that they are non-
white." Ngubo felt that the com-
plexity of the situation would make 
it difficult for persons of American 
citizenship to understand, pointing 
out that "non-whites have no 
political rights, no freedom of 
movement and no freedom of 
expression." He added that Ute 
oppression is completely based on 
the government's constitution, 
saying that " no discrimination 
would be unconstitutional." 
Having experienced both 
viewpoints, he said " the US is 
paradise." 

Ngubo said he approved of 
Ryer's trip, saying, "it would be 
silly to pretend the US has not been 
involved in South Africa. I'll 
definitely encourage people to 
improve educational op-
portunities. " 

First Asian Culture Week Set 
To Focus on Un·ique Heritage 

The UCSD Asian-American 
Student Alliance has scheduled 
next week for the first annual 
Asian Cultural Week in an attempt, 
according to AASA spokesperson 
Uoyd Ito, to " reach as broad a 

cultura~audience as possible" with 

the unique problems of Americans 
who have Asian heritages. 

One target of Asian Cultural 
Week is the Asian constituency 
itself, Ito said. According to Ito, the 
Asian-American experience is one 
of struggle in attempting to come 
to grips with the " roots" of cultural 
identity and, in Utis respect is 
unlike the historical struggles of 
oUter minorities in America. 

Asian Cultural Week should help 
to provide a format to address this 
peculiar dilemma, he said. 

Scheduled activities for next 
week start with a lecture Monday 
night at 7:30, in the Revelle Formal 
Lounge on the Chinese perspective 
on being Asian-American. . 

Tuesday night, films and a 
discussion period on the Asian 
American experience are set for 
7:00 in CR 167, Third College. 
Wednesday night a dramatic 
production by the East-West 
players will be presented, also in 
CRI07. 

A vide<Kape showing of "Golden 
Mountain," a dance theatre 
drematlzation of Ute Chinese-
American experience, written by 
Yen Lu Wong of the campus drama 
department, will top off the week 
on Thursday night. It will also be in 
CR 107, at8 :00. 

"Preswnably, Ute programs we 
have Utat are in South Africa are 
not only to help people that are in a 
bad system, but to encourage 
change in that system," said Ryer. 
He found American policy of the 
last decade to be one of "exerting 
pressure for change in South 
Africa, as a non-partisan point of 
view, regardless of the ad-
ministration." He said that there is 
some disagreement on whether 
maintaining ties or severing 
relations would be the most ef-
fective method of encouragement 
to the South African government 
and that he would be interested in 
seeing what President carter's 
policies will be in the next year. 

Ryer's impression of the area 
was that it was " a beautiful 
country: the land is beautiful. But I 
think it's a very tragic land, 
because unless the government 
changes, there will surely be 
terrible consequences, even-
tually." He added resolutely that 
" I certainly wouldn't want to live 
there." 

Inadequate education design 
Commenting on the inadequate 

educational system for non-Whites, 
Ngubo referred to the system 
adopted by the South African 
government in 1953. He said it was 
"designed to prepare the African 
child for his proper station in life," 
which Ngubo termed a "subor-
dinate one." Later, a college level 
was added, but Ngubo sees this as 
just a " glorified, poor high 
school." Ngubo said " you would 
laugh if you could see the high 
schools in South Africa. They 
prepare people for their place at 
the bottom of the economic, social 
and political ladders. " 

Arnett's bill would deny UI benefits to any studenl$ who place 
"unreasonable restrictions" on their availability for work (such as 
restricting availability to non-class hours ). 

He said this limitation would assure employers that most students 
~ould not be eligible for UI benefits , and they would be encouraged to 
hire more students. 

Students Have To "Earn It" 
But the bill is also designed to limit UI eligibility to only those students 

who have actually earned it, said Chuck Cavalier, an aide in Arnett's 
office. He said Arnett does not want students to use the UI fund for a 
scholarship. 

cavalier said the bill was introduced in direct response to the court 
decision on Enid Ballantyne, a UCLA law student who early last year 
claimed she was eligible for UI benefits. 

To be eligible for the benefits, a person must be available for work. 
Because Ballantyne restricted her availability to non-class hours or to a 
full-time job paying $1,000 or more a month, the Employment Develop-
ment Department refused her claim. 

Ball.antyne appealed the EDD decision to the UI Appeals Board which 
ruled 10 her favor. The EDD took Ute case to Sacramento Superior Court 
which also ruled in Ballantyne's favor. 

Superior Court Judge Lawrence Karlton agreed with Ute narrow in-
terpretation of eligibility presented by the EDD. But he said Ballantyne 
fell within those limits. 

Criteria for Eligibility 
According to the criteria established by the court, unemployed students 

would be eligible for UI compensation if they: 
-have a history of supporting themselves by part-time work while in 
school; 
-have a claim based on part-time work; 
-are willing to work the same hours as before they were unemployed ; 
-have no other restriction on work availability and are in a labor 
market where work is available. 

The EDD appealed the Superior Court's decision to Ute Third District 
Court of Appeal. But the case has not been decided yet. 

Arnett feels that Ballantyne unreasonably restricted her availability 
for work, and should not be eligible for UI benefits, cavalier said. 
Arnett's bill would narrow the eligibility interpretation which has been 
broadened by the Ballantyne case. 

The most striking of the in-
equalities in the South African 
system according to Ngubo is the 
fact that white children are 
assured a mandatory , free 
education and the black child is 
required to pay for all his or her 
educational expenses from the first 
day of school. " The bla'tk com-
munity has suffered greatly," said 
Ngubo, because they are denied 
the education " that most societies 
take as a normal service. " 

Ngubo felt that the problem is 
not even comparable to the racial 
divisions in the US's souUt, where 
faciiities were said to be 'separate 
but equal." "Separate, yes," said 
Ngubo, " but equality is not part of 
South Africa. The important thing 
is that Utey are separate." Non-
whites are required to carry a 
passbook on their person at all

Stress Seminar Offers Tips On Taking Tests 
by Dan St. Claire Bacon 

Staff Writer 
The pattern is familiar. You walk into Ute exam 

room fully prepared to take the exam, but as you 
stare at the test In front of you, your mind blanks. 
Formulas, equations and theories cloud your mind. 
You can't arrive at the answers to Ute test questions. 
As anxiety sets In, your confidence dwindles. Ter\ 
minutes after Ute exam is over your mind clears. You 
can give the answers to the test questions easUy now, 
but it's too late. 

Dr. Hugh Pates of U SO Counseling an 
Psychological Servic held a stress eminar la t 
W dn day in whi h h outlined four st ps to e am 
taking. A cording to Pate, "Test taking is mat r 
of . nfid nc and th lowering of confid n re t . 

a feeling of anxiety." As you prepare yourself for the 
exam, Pates said, you should prepare yourself to take 
Ute ~xam. By doing thi.! you can help retain your 
confIdence, thus eliminati1g the feeling of anxiety. 

First, Pate recommen:is that you don't study 24 
hours before the exam. [luring Ulat time do some 
enjoyable activity. This all.)w the body to relax. The 
second step deals with your IiWtude toward the 
exam. Pates f els that one should look at the test as 
an opportunity to show your professor or TA how 
much you know. Third, look at Ute total eAtlm. Do the 
ea ie t qu tions first. T t how that on thu:!

Letters to the Editor 

Wedaelday, May 11, 1m 

Open Letter to Dr. N1cElroy 
Campus Waste Noted 

I am prompted to write you by the observation I made wa1ldng home 
tonight: the sprinklers were watering the grass at Third College, in spite 
of the fact that it was pouring rain, and had been all day long. 

If -this were an isolated instance, an exception rather than the rule, I 
would not have been able to over come my Inertia and write this letter. 
Unfortunately, this is not the case. Since I came to U~D last fall, I have 
been continually appalled at the University's wastefulness of energy and 
water, and at the fact that it doesn't seem to bother anybody but me. 

I don't get very much exposure to the rest of the campllS, but If the 
situation at the School of Medicine is anywhere near representative, Gov. 
Brown ought to shut this place down. Last fall, when it was hot outside, 
the Biomedical Library was consistently freezing (60 degrees), while the 
Basic Science Building Lecture halls varied from 80 degrees (with the 
heat apparently on) to 55 degrees (more usual). One room in the BSB got 
the nickname "the Freezer" (B-2~), because of chronic over-alr con-
ditioning. 

On a sunny day, it would not be unusual to see one's breath in the 
Freezer. 

When President Saxon issued his directive to set all University ther-
mostats to 65 degrees, this was indeed done at ~he medical school, with 
the reJiult that when it was 75 degrees outside, the library would have its 
air conditioning on in order to maintain the temperature at 65 degrees. 
When the weather got colder, temperatures of 80 degrees became almost 
as frequent as 60 degrees. My (and no doubt others') repeated calls to 
x2930 (utilities troubles) did not seem to have any lasting effect on these 
problems, although there would occasionally be a one or two day respite. 

Koala is Fitting Image for UCSD 
I have also been frustrated by the University's wastage of water. It 

doesn't rain here so often that having the sprinklers goir)g in the rain can 
be said to be a frequent occurrence, but that doesn't make it any less 
idiotic. It ill clear that if it was their time to go on, the University 
sprinklers would go on no less punctually if the University was under four 
feet of water. 

Another example of water wastage is the leak (novr finally repaired) 
that was in the water pipe that goes along the bike path by the.basebaU 
field (between the Mesa apartments and Scripps Hospital). For at least 
six months (and probably years) this leak would cause water to shoot five 
or ten feet into the air several hours each day, making the bike path a 
muddy mess, in addition to wasting water. Again, my repeated calls to 
x2930 were met with such an apparent absence of concern for what I 
considered an emergency, that I felt I must be calling the wrong people 
and gave up. 

Today's trivia question is . . . 
What is a Triton? Nobody knows 
and besides, what difference does 
it make? The school mascot should 
reflect the quality and the spirit of 
a school. 

UCLA has its Bruin and Berkeley 
its Golden Bear. In the same fine 
Cal tradition UCSD should 
establish the Koala Bear as our 

mascot. Everyone knows the 
natural habitat of the Koala Bear is 
the San Diego Zoo, so the new 
mascot will be representative of 
geographical location. Maybe we 
will be able to start our very own 
Koala colony in the eucalyptus 
grove somewhere in between the 
Central Library and Third College. 

Ever seen a Koala Bear? ... it 

Young Socialist Alliance 
Denies Anti-Semetism Charge 

It is necessary for us to respond 
to the article submitted by Ralph 
Grunewald to the Triton Times 
(May 9) . The reason is that while 
we respect anybody's right to 
disagree with us, we cannot allow 
Grunewald's libelous slur that our 
ideas are " anti-semitic," to go 
unchallenged. 

In reality, nothing could be 
further from the truth. The Young 
Socialist Alliance and our fraternal 
organization, the Socialist Workers 
Party, support the rights of all 
oppressed people, including Jews. 
We support the right of Jewish 
people to live anywhere in the 
world they want, including the land 
of Palestine. But we do not support 
the chauvinistic Zionist govern-
ment that denies the same right to 
another people - the indigenous 
Palestinians, most of whom are in 
exile from their homeland, and are 
kept out by force. As we made 
clear before, we make a firm 
distinction between Judaism and 
political Zionism. 

We have a pamphlet that 
Grunewald could certainly learn 
from. It is titled "Socialists and the 
Fight Against Anti-Semitism: An 
Answer to the B'nai B'rith Anti-
Defamation League" . In 
November of 1972, that 
organization made the same Wljust 
assertion as Grunewald, about thl' 
SWP. The SWP, in tum, prepared I 
thorough reMopse . They point d 
out, for example , that their grl up 
was in the fo ~eJront in demanl.ing 
unrestricted ~ntry into the U &ited 
States, for oppressed Ger.nany 
Jewry during World W Jr II. 
Shamefully, American tlonisUi 
opposed the lilting of the im-
migration (;Uptas, hoping the 
refugees cou:d be "diverted" so as 
to further t Ie Zionist goa I of a 
future Jewis 1 tate. Another im-
portant fact biven, is that there are 
many Jewish members in the 
Socialist Workers Party as well as 
theYSA. 

And it is interesting that the only 
evidence Grunewald presents to 
support his charge, is his belief 
that we "singl out Israel as the 
main culprit" in trad with South 
Mrica, when it actually has many 

trade partners. His belief is untrue. 
The YSA and SWP are currently 
part of an international effort to 
pressure the Western powers 
(particularly the US and Great 
Britain) to sever their economic 
ties with the apartheid regime. It is 
those nations we really single out. 
We only mentioned Israel's role 
before , because our article was 
about that country. 

Grunewald misinterprets the 
meaning of trade relations. Trade 
between governments does not 
necessarily indicate friendship. 
The majority of nations he names 
are those with underdeveloped, 
dependent economies, who are 
forced to trade to a certain degree 
with South Africa, an in-
dustrialized western power, out of 
economic necessity. Most of the . 
rest of her partners are just 
profiteering western countries, a 
few of whom have\ played major 
roles in building South Mrica, and 
all of whom we flatly condemn. 

What is significant about Israel, 
is how its imports and exports with 
South Africa have both increased 
by about one thousand percent, 
from 1965 to 1974. This does not 
even include how Israel, as one of 
the world 's leading diamond 
processors, buys over $100 million 
worth of raw diamond annually 
from the London-based Central 
Selling Organization of the 
DeBeers Corp. of South Africa. 

But ultimately, trade is a 
secondary issue, and we presented 
it as much in our previous article. 
It is basically one illustration of 
something more important - the 
d03C frlenrlllhlp that has developed 
between the Zionist settler state 
and the Boer settler state . Both 
have become staunch political 
allies because each has become 
increasingly ostracized by the 
international community . They 
have fa lien Lnto each other's arms. 
And in our opinion, this is un-
derstandable since they have much 
in common ; each is a racist, 
reactionary regime whose very 
existence is due to the repression of 
an indigenous population. 

YO NG [ALl T ALLIANCE 

never fights fiercely like the 
Berkeley or LA bears ... a Koala is 
friendly, mellow and it hides from 
large crowds by climbing to the top 
of a tree . . . sort of like UCSD 
students hidden away in the 
libraries ignoring the large crowds 
of intercollegiate athletic contests. 

Yesterday somebody said a 
Koala Bear gets high on eucalyptus 
leaves and sunshine ... that would 
fit UCSD too. Just as a liberal arts 
major is an endangered species of 
this science oriented campus, so 
too is the Koala also endangered. 
The Koala Bear is eminently 
koalified for tenure at UCSD ... 
just think how many coloring books 
the Koala sells at the zoo. 

The University's wastage of water and energy are bad not just because 
of ,the resources they waste, but also because of the example of in-
difference they set. An individual like me, after seeing the University's 
sprinklers on in pouring rain, feels pretty ridiculous taking short showers 
and saving his dishwater for the plants. Similarly, it's harder to motivate 
turning down the thermostat in my student apartment (where the 
University pays the utilities anyway), when I feel that all the energy I 
could save in a year is wasted by the University in 30 seconds. 

1 would much rather feel that individual contributions can make a 
difference. So even if the University is not going to save any energy at all, 
could you at least make the wastefulness a little. less blatant?

Representative of Paramedic Program 
Accuses The Times of Misrepresentation 

I must take exception to some remarks attributed 
to me in your news article "Council Reconsiders 
Paramedic Program" publis.hed in the March 7 
edition of the Triton Times. 

My objection is to the way in which your article 
took remarks of mine out of context, particularly in 
paragraphs one and two of the section headed 
" Hartsons Could Not Provide. ~' 

In the first sentence of this section, I was quoted as 
saying that Hartsons could not provide all of the 
personnel and equipment necessary to implement a 
total citywide program. My statement in fact was 
that the private ambulance operators (not specifying . 
Hartsons) did not currently have in their employ 
sufficient San Diego certified paramedics to im-
plement a citywide system, and that paramedics 
trained in other areas would have to undergo a 

examination before they could be 

certified by the County of San Diego. 
To the best of my knowledge, private ambulance 

operators would have no difficulty in recruiting 
enough suitable personnel to "challenge" the San 
Diego County certification. The provision of adequate 
quantities of suitable equipment by private am-
bulance operators was not mentioned in my i& 
terview, but Incidentally I have no doubt that such 
operators would have no difficulty providing 
whatever equipment was necessary. 

In the second sentence of this section, I was ac-
tually asked for my opinion of a 12 unit proposal for 
the city without specifying the submitting agency, but 
your writer inserted the agency name. I still believe 
however, that the city managers estimation of bet-
ween 20 and 22 units would be necessary to cover all 
areas of the city.

Pates pointed out that those 
students who had to initially 
struggle with the most difficult 
problems lost some of their con-
fidence. This ultimately affected 
their test scores. The final 
preparatory step that should be 
done several times before the day 
of the exam is to simply close your 
eyes and let your shoulders drop. 
Then imagine yourself, fully 
relaxed and confident, taking the 
exam. According to Pates, taking 
the exam will be a lot easier once 
you've rehearsed it. 

Alternate Methods 
Harvey Selverston, a consultant 

on stress and on staff at UCSD, 
spoke at the seminar on ways to 
combat anxiety in any situation. 
He noted that one is really c0m-
batting distress. Stress is a normal 
physiological aspect of our bodies, 
said Selverston, noting that the 
stress mechanism in our bodies 
generates energy. One can combat 
distress by rechanneling that 
energy. According to Selverston 
"You can take the edge off yourself 
in one minute." Exercises 
described to alleviate stress i& 

eluded abdominal breathing and 
simple hand exercises. Selverston 
said you can put your hands 
together so they barely touch, and 
when you feel the warmth between 
them, spread them apart until you 
just lose touch with that warmth. 
Continue this exercise a few times, 
and the stress should be alleviated. 

Every quarter there is a stress 
reduction workshop sponsored by 
the UCSD Counseling and 
Psychological Services. For more 
information students can call 
Extension 3490 or 3755.

The 1977 crew program "was the 

best Ua;D ever had," according to 
head coach Jack Vallerga. 

starting slowly at the San Diego 
Crew Classic in early April, the 
Tritons managed to place only the 
freslunan and women's eight shells 
in the grand finals races, which 
were dominated by perennial 
powers OCC, Pen and University of 
Washington. 

As the season progressed and 
opposing crews offered easier 
competition, the men's freshman 
eight and lightweight eight squads 
won most of their 2000 meter 
matches against San Diego State, 
Loyola, USC and UCSB. 

For the freshman eight team, 
Vallerga noted (in crew as a rule) 
there were no individual standouts 

extent, considered the mastennind 
of the Tritoo crew p.rogram. "The 
team here had collapsed in 73-74. In 
1975, my first year as coach, I 
started out with all frestunen." At 
the outset of each fall quarter, 
Vallerga's teams practice six days 
a week, mostly in the late af-
ternoons (making room for the 
coach to earn a living as a su~ 
stitute teacher for the San Diego 
Unified School District in the 
mornings) and very early mor-
nings at Mission Bay. 

"In the fall, we get many In-
terested freshmen who have never 
rowed before." So, Vallerga has to 
separate the veterans from the 
rookies, instructing the latter 
group in fundamentals. But, by the 
second quarter, which is "the gut

For crew at UCSD, what coach 
Jack Vallerga termed " the

about in one season, it takes years-

Team Second in District 
By Jon Halperin 
Sports Editor 

It was a Team effort with a 
capital "T". 
The UCSD men's tennis team 

captured second place in the 
NAIA District III championship 
held last weekend in Thousand 
Oaks and in doing so qualified for 
the National Tournament to be 
held in Kansas City. 

A number of key upsets, along 
with the consistent play of Billy 
Hein and John Gerdsen, gave 
UCSD its finest finish ever. 

In the first round, Revelle 
sophomore Alex Rosenthal pulled 
the upset of the tournament. He 
beat the number two seed, Steve 
Tennis of Point Lorna, 6-3, 6-2, in 
what 'coach Tad Yamaguchi 

. called "Alex's best match as a 
Triton." 

Ron Phillips also pulled a first 
round upset as he beat Cal 
Lutheran's number one player, 
Mark Howie, in straight sets, 7"" 
7". 

In fact, every Triton made it 
past the first ' round of play and 
only Paul Meisch and Jack 
Broudy failed to make the second 
round. 

In the third round, John Ger-
dsen decided to harass the of-
ficials rather than his opponent 
and lost 6-2, 6-2. He had beaten 
Whittier's top player, BiU Ham, in 
the previous round. 

Ron Phillips had the un-
fortunate experience of the 
unlucky draw. The talented fresh-
man had to play three number 1 
singles players. He beat two of 
them, but eventually lost to the 
tournament c hampion, Steve 
Chare of Redlands . 

Alex Rose nthal was the third 

to fall in the third round of 
He lost to John Benthiem of 

Pitzer !HI, 6-3. 

only UCSD player to make 
tlJe third round was former 

High star Billy Hein. Hein 
three tough opponents to get 

to the quarter finals but he too ran 
up against Steve Chare of 
Redlands and lost 6-1, 6-4.

" 8 
I: 

Hein did not go unrewarded, 
however. He received a silver 
medal and was named to the all-
district squad. 

In the doubles competition, the 
number one team of Paul Metsch 
and John Gerdsen made it to the 
quarter-finals, only to be upset by 
a tough Pamona Pitzer tandem. 
The number two team of Jack 
Broudy and Bill Hein only made it 
to the second round of play. 
Gerdsen and Metsch were named 
to the all-district team for their 
doubles play. 

The Tritons finished behind the 
eleven-time national champion, 
University of Redlands, while 
tallying 24 points. Highly ranked 
Occidental had to settle for third 
place behind Tad Yamaguchi's 
netters. 

Now that the team has qualified 
for Nationals, the age old problem 
of funding becomes more ap-
parent. There is no money in the 
UCSD PE department and the 
total cost of the trip is $2400. 

The Tritons were also invited to 
play in the NCAA division 1 
championships against the likes of 
UCLA and USC but again the lack 
of funds prevented the netters 
from going east. The invitation 
came as a result of the Tritons 
early season victory over Arizona 
State. It was the only loss the Sun 
Devils incurred for the season. 

So it seems once more that a 
qualified group of young athletes 
will be left at home only to think of 
what could have been. The 1977 
men's tennis team did what few 
thought they would accomplish; 
they qualified for a national 
tournament. Coach Tad 
Yamaguchi can finally hold his 
head high, and so should every 
member of the men' s squad. No 
longer is UCSD that little school 
on the La Jolla bluffs, we have 
arrived.

School Records Set 

UCSD's mile relay team ran 3:23.8 
to break a decade old school record, 
but it was only good enough for fifth 
place. The quartet of Frank Longo 
(51.0), Morning (48.5 ), Lan 
Freestone (52.1) and Eric Hendricks 
(SO.2) eclipsed the old mark of 3:25.0. 
Each individual split was a personal 
best. Freestone's 15.4 in the 110 meter 
high hurdles (5th place) gave the 
Tritons their final three points of the 
day. 

Even though they failed to score, 
UCSD's 440 relay team set a school 
record of 43.3, bettering the old 
standard of 43.4 established in 1973. 

Personal Bests 
Rich Petheridge heaved the discus 

129'4" and Joe Starvish was timed in 
2:02.0 for 800 meters as both achieved 
lifetime bests and went unplaced. 
Stravish held on to third place 
coming into the final turn of his race, 
but he ran out of gas against a strong 
field.

Ngubo. "The non-whites are stuck 
as unskilled laborers, where you 
can only go so far, then the law 
says 'no more.'" He spoke of the 
real poverty that is felt, because 
they are the least paid workers. 
Non-whites are crowded into 
gll4:!ttos and have little opportunity 
for medical attention. "For 18 
million people, there are less than 
100 doctors," according to Ngubo.

illegal. You need pennission and 
surely they won' t give permission

there are two fleeta of ambulances, 
taxis, buses, trains and other 
facilities. "You can't simply hail. 
cab!" quipped Ngubo. But on a 
more serious note he explained 
that even a white person could die 
if a white hospital were not clOle 
by. "You couldn't just walk into a 
black hospital. " 

The 111 report was submitted to 
the Cultural Affairs Division of the 
Department of state, and was 
unavailable for review. But Ryer 
commented on the purpose behind 
the organization, saying that "they 
are a private corporation that is a 
broker for students and faculty 
who come from overseas to the 
US," adding that they coordinate 
more exchanges than anybody 
else. , 

Ryer also said their philosophy 
is "to promote international peace 
and understanding through 
education." He added that the US 
government already has four or 
five programs for South Africans 
to study in the US, but the purpose 
of the trip was to learn "whether 
they should be increased, 
decreased or remain the same." 

Paramedics.. 
Continued from Page % 

The first sentence of the second 
paragraph was also misquoted; I 
in fact stated that fire department 
personnel had basically entered 
into a rescue oriented career; 
within the fire department or 
police department there also 
existed opportunities for upward 
promotion which might not be so 
well formalized within private 
ambulance operations ; I further 
stated that fire department per-
sonnel were required to maintain a 

. study habit after their initial 
training, and this tended to make 
such personnel better students 
during paramedic training. 

The reporting bias that appeared 
in the article tended to attribute 
remarks to me which were directly 
infiammatory to Hartsons 
Ambulance, and this coupled with 
quotes out of context and inac-
curaci es in reporting my 
statements, appears to have 
maligned this ambulance com-
pany, I regard the Hartson 
operation as being highly 
professional and medically 
competent and I cannot question 
the motivation or attitude of those 
of ~heir personnel with whom I 
have come in contact. I also have a 
high personal regard for their 
administration, honesty and ~ 
tegrity and feel that they have been 
unfairly victimized in your article.
