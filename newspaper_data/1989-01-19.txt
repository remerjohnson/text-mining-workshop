Gay Student Housing 

Berkeley Students' Proposal Wins 
U CSA Support In Recent Vote 

By PORSCHE SHANTZ 
Staff Writer 

The University of California 
Student Association (UCSA) 
voted 11-3-1 on Jan . 8 to support 
a proposal written by four 
member of the UC Berkeley 
Student Association (AS UC) 
that would allow homosexual 
couples the option of applying for 
family student housing. 

"We went to the UCSA for 
th.eir endor ement becau e they 
are the only official student lob-
bying group that the Regent rec-
ognize," said Kevin Goebel, co-
author of the proposal and 
Outreach Chair for the UC Berke-
ley Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual 
Alliance. 

The proposal was written for 
the Berkeley chancellor by AS U C 
Senators Marti Epstein and Mike 

Powell in conjunction with that 
organization's student advocate 
and campu affairs officers. 

"Our chancellor has given indi-
cations that he will support this 
proposal," Goebel continued . "I 
know that many lower-level 
ad mini trators already support 
this proposal." 

Prior to the UCSA meeting, 
the UCSD Graduate Student 
Association (GSA) voted 12-2 in 
favor of the Berkeley proposal. 

The view expressed at the ov. 
8 G A meeting was that it i 
neces ary for the UC sy tern to 
work on developing a ubstitute 
for a marriage certificate that 
would recognize same-sex rela-
tionship as legitimate partner-
hips. , 

would allow my partner and I to 
afford living together." 

Last year, a lesbian couple app-
lied for family student housing at 
UC Irvine and were denied. They 
appealed their case to the U 
President's Office and the Uni-
versity-wide Council of Chancel-
lors where it was decided that the 
University would continue its 
practice of limiting housing to 
students who hold a marriage cer-
tificate that is recognized by the 
state of California. 

After the Irvine appeal failed , 
David Gentry, As ociate Dean of 
Students at UC Irvine, wrote a 
formal proposal to that campus's 
chancellor outlining a policy for 
same- ex couples to apply for 
family student housing and receive 
special consideration. 

Financial Need May. Force UCSD To 
Require Parking Permits at Night 

Some students believe that the 
absence of space for homosexual 
couples in family student housing 
is di criminatory and should be 
corrected. 

"I feel that this is just one of 
many areas where the University 
IS violating its non-discrimination 
policy," said U CS D graduate stu-
dent R. Wood Massi. "In view of 
of the AIDS epidemic. I think 
that it is important for the Uni-
ver ity to help upport committed 
monogamous relationships in the 
gay community. 

Cases are now decided on an 
individual basis and no compre-
hensive policy that allows all 
ame-sex couples to apply for 

family student housing exists. 
" It is still unclear what will 

happen [to the propo al] this 
year," said UCSD grad stud en 
Norman Tien, UCSA vice pre i-
dent. " Many people are concerned 
with how this will affect the vol-
ume of applicants for tudent hous-
ing and how it might change pri-
or!tizing methods for applicants." 

Hike in Parking Permit Cost Also Possible 

By ERIC CHAZANKIN 
Associate News Editor 

A proposal to require parking 
permits in the evenings at UCSD 
is moving through University chan-
nels, and is "almost certain" to 
gain approval, according to 
ASUCSD President Maynard 
Dimmesdale. 

Dimmesdale explained that the 
proposal originated from an at-
tempt to charge UCSD extension 
students, whose classes are prim-
arily in the evenings, for parking. 

Commuter students who cur-
rently park off-campus during the 
day and bring their cars 
on-campus in the evenings, 
Dimmesdale added, would be ai-
fected by the new policy as well. 

He estimated that Implementa-
tion of the policy would begin 
early in the spring quarter of this 
year. 

Dimme dale aid that the Uni-
versity's need for "generation of 
revenue"stemming from the need 
for increased parking facilitie!\ and 
the future con truction of a park-
ing structure near the pre ent lo-
cation ofthe University Bookstore 
provided the impetu for the new 
parking mea ure. 

"Parking funds need to be 
created," Dimme dale aid, pre-
dicting that "A soon a structure 
parking i on campu ,you will ee 
a super-inflated jump in [parking 
permit] fee." 

The policy i being recommend-
ed by the UCSD Parking Com-
mittee, but Dimmesdale says that 
the idea for the policy did not 
originate with the Committee. 

"[The Committee] has been told 
what is going to happen," Dim-
mesdale said, adding that in his 
opinion, "the real force behind 
this is Vice Chancellor [of Busi-
ness Affairs Steven] Relyea ... " 

As of pre s time, Relyea had 
not been reachable for comment. 

According to Dimme dale, 
"Every programming organiza-
tion on campu is vehemently 
opposed to [this change]." How-
ever, he explained that "there arc 

no programming representative 
on the parking committee." 

Although the new parking pol-
icy will probably be instituted this 
year, Dimmesdale said he doubts 
that a rise in parking fees will 
occur this year. 

"My partner lives in San Fran-
ci co and I would like to have the 
option of having him move in 
with me," Massi continued. "Right 
now that is not a financial possi-
bility for me. I think this proposal 

According to Shirley Finer, 
Director of Apartment Li ing at 
UC Berkeley, volume of appli-
cants for family student hou ing

A. S. Votes to Keep Assorted Vinyl 
By LAURA PROCTOR 
Staff Writer 

The A.S. Council voted last night to retain the 
Assorted Vinyl enterprise. The record store is 
scheduled to move to the new Price Center as 
originally planned. 

Several students attended the meeting to how 
support for the continuation of Assorted Vinyl. 

Erik Nielsen, a former Third College Senator, 
urged the council to "look at [the As orled Vinyl] 
is ue in a long-term perspective, not a hort-term." 

He sugge ted ub idizing the store until it be-
gins making a profit, adding, "Our enterprise 
don't necessarily have to make a profit." 

Nielsen said that one po ibility is to u e profit 
from the Grove Cafft: to compensate for los es at 
A sorted Vinyl. 

He argued that since the Cafft: makes over 
$50,000 per year, it profit could easily ubsidize 
A sorted Vinyl, whose yearly deficits have been 
about $4,000. 

Robert Lloyd, one ofthe tore' manager, aid 
that the enterprise hould not be treated strictly 
a a money-making venture, but added that the 
tore would expand it merchandise to increa e 

profits at t he new location." 

"It's not going to be the same Assorted Vinyl," 
he added. "The stock we carry is going to be more 
mainstream. " 

Vice President-Financial Eduardo Rallo-Ver-
dugo noted that continuing the store seemed to 
be in the students' best interests. 

"I think it's very important that we ee that our 
enterprise don't have to profit all the time," he 
said, adding ")t's a risk for ure - but it's a good 
risk. " 

Programming Commissioner Jonathan Juda-
ken said, advocating the closure of A orted 
Vinyl, "There's no question that it's an enterpri e . 
It's not a service, they are there to generate a 
profit. " 

The council voted against the measure to di -
continue A orted Vinyl, with 14 members 
opposing, five in favor, and one ab taining. 

Before the as orted Vinyl Re olution wa 
debated, Pre ident Maynard Dimme dale an-
nounced that he had cancelled hi plan for a 
Con titutional Convention. 

Previously, Dimme dale had hailed the con-
vention a a means to increa e tudent input into 
the revi ion of the current A. . on titution. 

He aid that over 1,000 tudent had igned a 
petition in favor of the propo ai, but that coun il 
upport wa limited. -

UCSF Housing Survey Results 

SAN FRANCISCO - Eighty percent of the stu-
dents responding to last month's survey conducted by 
the A.S. of UCSF have indicated that same-sex cou-
ples should be allowed access to UCSF's married stu-
dent housing. Some 64 percent felt that all couples -
married or unmarried - should be allowed to live in 
the Aldea facility . 

One third-year Aldea resident stated, "I am 
ashamed to live here knowing my gay and Ie bian 
friends in long-term relationships are not allowed to 
enjoy the benefits my husband and I do." 

Another student summed up the prevailing view-
point: "All couples in a committed domestic partner-
ship, regardless of marital status of sexual orientation, 
should have married student housing made available." 

New UC Tenure Policy Aids 
Professors With Young Children 

SA T A BARBARA - The University of Califor-
nia recently made the rough road to becoming a full-
fledged professor a lillie smoother for faculty 
members also raising children. 

A new UC policy, recognizing that family obliga-
tions can sometimes present obstacles to becoming a 
tenured professor not encountered by others. no~ 
extends the period of time assistant profe sors are 
allowed to remain on the "tenure track" before they 
are asked to leave. If a faculty member does become a 
tenured professor, he or she is more or less assured of 
job security. 

The policy is grounded on the belief that because 
parents cannot devote as much time to pursuing 
tenure as non-parents. the standard eight-year qualifi-
cation period should be extended if they take time off 
to spend with their families . So far, at least two 
U,CSB teachers who recently became fathers are eligi-
ble for the program . 

Adoption of the program has been partially cre-
dited to changing social roles . 

The Systemwide Academic Senate became inter-
ested in the policy change after it had been imple-
mented at other universities. 

Available only to assistant professors who have 
become parents, either biologically or through adop-
tion since July 1988, the policy was revi sed by the UC 
Academic Senate as an effort to attract more women

Robbery at UCSB Athletic Department 
May Have Been Inside Job 

SANTA BARBARA - While campus police nar-
rowed a list 0\ possible suspects the theft of $10,000 
from an athletics department safe, University officials 
complained Tuesday Dec. 10 that the circumstances 
of the burglary may render the money unrecoverable 
due to insurance stipulations. 

UCSB Police said the afe shows no indication of a 
forced entry, leading investigators to believe that the 
money was taken by omeone with access to both the 
ticket office and the safe. Since the combination to 
the safe was changed within the last year, only a 
limited number of people should have access to it, 
narrowing considerably the list of suspects. 

If it is officially determined that no means of forced 
entry were employed , the athletic departments's insu-
rance policy on such losses will become void, leaving 
the department and club sports, which also had 
money in the safe, with a combined $10.000 loss. 

The investigation is focusing on individuals who 
have access to the safe. UCSB policy 73181 requires 
the changing of safe combinations upon the departure _ 
of any employee who knew those combinations. 

The money should have been depostited with the 
cashier's office, but why it was not is still unknown.

Three UCSD Faculty Members 
Honored By Chancellor's Associates 

The UCSD's Chancellor's Associates have pres- . 
ented their annual faculty awards to biology professor 
Paul Price, associate professor of surgery Dr. Steven 
R . Shackford, and philosophy professor Patricia 
Churchland. 

Each received a citation and a check for S 1,000 to 
mark their outstanding efforts in teaching, research or 
public service. 

Price won the award for excellence in teaching. His 
citation noted that he ~brings a special kind of 
commitment and enthusiasms to the classroom. 

~Paul Price's dedication to teaching is truly exem-
plary, and we are fortunate to have him as a longtime

member of the UCSD faculty." 
Shackford captured the award for excellence in 

community service. His citation read in part: "Steve 
Shackford's contributions in the area of health care 
extend far beyond the University. He was instrumental 
in demonstrating the need for a trauma system in San 
Diego. 

~He then worked closely with the County Depart-
ment of Health to establish what is often called the 
finest trauma system in the country." 

Churchland was honored for research efforts that 
have led her to become, in the words of her citation, 
"the World's premiere scholar who bridges philo-
sophy, cognitive science and the neurosciences. 

"The aim of her research is to understand the var-
ious neural activities that sustain perception, memory, 
consciousness, and intelligent behavior. Her research 
may well reshape the definition of the concept of 'the 
person.' " 

The awards were presented during a recent meeting 
of the Chancellor's Associates, a group of business 
and community leaders in the San Digo area who 
support the campus through activities and contribu-
tions to a variety of UCSD programs.

Atkinson to 
HeadScience 
Organization 
By ERIC CHAZANKIN 
Associate News Editor 

UCSD Chancellor Richard C. 
Atkinson has been named presi-
dent of the American Association 
for the Advancement of Science 
(AAAS) and is being installed at 
the association's annual meeting 
this week in San Francisco. 

The AAAS is a national, inter-
disciplinary scientific organization 
whose 132,000 members are drawn 
from about 300 different scientific 
groups. 

I n addition to its other activi-
ties, the AA S publishes Science 
magazine. Among the Associa-
tion's goals are the promotion of 
science generally, and informing 
the public of scientific develop-
ments. This latter aim is the focus 
of the association's meeting this 
week. 

In a phone interview from San 
Francisco, Atkinson looked for-
ward to his new tasks as AAAS 
president with enthusiasm. 

"This is an important time in 
national issues in science," Atkin-
son said. "I hope that during my 
presidency, we will advance the

cause of science." 
In past interviews, Atkinson 

has targeted the improvement of 
education in various scientific dis-
ciplines in the U.S. as one of his 
major goals as leader of the 
AAAS. 

He has argued that not enough 
Americans are being ed ucated in 
scientific disciplines, and that as a 
resu lt we wiII , in the future, be 
short not only of trained scientists 
but also of professors capable of 
encouraging scientific pursuits 
through their teaching. 

Atkinson has compared the 
level of science education in the 
U.S. to that of several foreign 
countries, arguing that foreign 
students are generally ahead of 
those in the U.S. 

He also mentioned that a large 
number of foreign students are 
now taking advantage of the edu-
cational opportunities available 
in U.S. schools. 

Atkinson, a psychology profes-
sor by training, will serve as pres-
ident of the AAAS for one year, 
after which time he will become 
chairman of its board of directors 
for another year. This is the nor-

. mal pattern of succession for a 

. president of the AAAS.

PROPOSAL: Same-Sex 
Housing Gets Support 
Continued from pale I 
proposal is implemented . 

" I'm not altogether sure that 
hundreds of people will be willing 
to sign the affadavit [included in 
the proposal] that swears that 
they are in a committed relation-
ship," Finer said. 

The dissenting opinions on the 
UCSA board were not against the 
concept of providing housing to 
homosexual students, but were 
more concerned with issues that 
the proposal did not address. 

"If you let this proposal pass 
than you are still leaving out a big 
group of non-married committed 
partners, namely heterosexual 
co uples," said John Leyman, UC 
Riverside's UCSA representative. 
"The people at Berkeley say that 
their proposal is designed to deal 
with discrimination against same-
sex couples," Leyman continued. 

"They say that heterosexual 
cohabitation is not the issue, but I 
don't think that heterosexuals 
should be forced to get married in 
order to live together in Univer-
sity housing together," he said . 

The position of the GSA is that 
making the plan any broader 
would simply be restating the 
University's policy that already 
exists of non-<iiscrimination a-
gainst students because of their 
sexual orientation. 

According to the terms of the 
proposal, "in order to prevent 
abuse by same-sex platonic 
friends, same-sex couples must 
establish that they are a married 
family in all senses except legal 
recognition ... 

The proposal goes on to estab-
lish the criteria for how a domes-
tic partnership analogous to a 
legal marriage will be defined . 

The proposal states that "To 
maximize the correlation between 
unmarried same-sex families and 
legally-married opposite-sex fam-
ilies, we believe the couples must 
demonstrate: (1) that they are 
members of a committed rela-
tionship, and (2) that their rela-
tionship is one of financial inter-
dependence ... 

"I feel that this is just 
one of many areas where 
the University is violat-
ing its non-discrimima-
tion policy. " 

-R. Wood Massi 

According to Mary Beth Sny-
der, Director of Student Affairs 
in the Office of the President of 
the University of California, the 
proposal is strictly a campus issue. 

"It is my understanding that it 
is legal in the state of Califonia for 
colleges and universities to dis-
criminate on the basis of marital 
status for the purposes of student 

.-------------~~~~~~~~--------------~

housing," Snyder said. 
It is legal for colleges and uni-

versities to do this becau e they 
are exempted from the California 
Fair Employment and Housing 
Act. This statute makes it illegal 
for other housing institutions to 
discriminate on the basis of mari-
tal status. 

According to Mary MacDo-
nald of the Office of the General 
Counsel of the Regents, the Uni-
versity is within its legal rights to 
discriminate for the purposes of 
housing against same-sex couples 
who do not po!,sess a valid mar-
riage certificate. 

But members of the gay com-
munity feel that reserving family 
housing for only students with 
marriage certificates is equivalent 
to discriminating against sexual 
orientation. 

" Heterosexuals have the option 
of getting married wheareas 
same-sex cou pIes do not," Massi 
said. "I think that University 
housing is designed to support 
families, and the term family 
doesn't just apply to a man and a 
woman. The University's policy 
now is myopic to the family life of 
same-sex couples." 

The State of California grants 
legal marriage certificates only to 
couples of opposite sexes. Al-
though the Regents have always 
used this definition in establishing 
their policy on married student 
housing they are not required by 
law to do so.

OPINION---
--____________________________ ~~D~~~~---------------------------

Is Ronald Reagan about 10 leave office with his guns blazing? 
- Patrick Buchanan, CN . 1/ 4/ 89 

G eorge Bush is exuberant the e days. He has cli med the Whole Ladder, and now he is gelling a free ride to his new pad in the White Hou e, which is almost ready for occupancy. 
But not yet. There are bats in the belfry and gray areas in the lease. 

Hi old friend Ron ha been slow moving out, and Nancy has made it 
impossible for Bush staff people to begin the redecorating process. It 
is awkwa rd , but the Reagans seem not to notice, and nobod y wants 
to push them. 

Ron is working harder than ever, they say - putting long days in 
the office and long nights on the telephone, taking care of business . . .. 
Even his wife is urprised by the zeal he has brought to these final 
days of his long and triumphant presidency. The official word is that 
he' "j ust tyi ng up loose ends," but he is doing it with an unnatural 
energy that caused speculation among the servants that he might 
have got his hands on some speed , or maybe one of those newfangled 
antihistamines with the unpredictable side effects. 

"N ot so," said the press office. The old man was just cranked up 
about going back home to the Sky Ranch and chopping a few cords 
of wood . But until then, by golly, he would be The President. It 
would be a hands-on transition. 

Meanwhile, Bush enjoys all the power and privilege of the presi-
dency without any of the burdens and responsibilities . It is one of 
those very rare moments in life - a feeling of total success and 
victory and righteousness that comes to so few men in this world that 
it should always be recognized and honored ... if on ly for what it is, 
and ior the special light it gives off. 

George Bush is a "club man," a joiner - he has joined eve rything 
from "SkUll & Bones" to the Cigarette Society, and on ov. 8, he 
joined one of the most exclusive clu bs in history, a fraternity of 
st rangers with more power and fewer members than anything since 
the Caesars or the Khans. That is a high achievement a nd those of us 
in the business salute him for it. 

Big-time professional politics is a Cruel Sport and a Merciless 
Business - or maybe a merciless sport and a cruel business - but 
either way, it is a very hard dollar and a dangerous way of life. 

There is no Politicians' Hall of Fame. But if pros and winners and 
heavy hitters maintained one, there would be a special scroll on a 
special wall for the Short List of the few who went all the way and did 
what all the other only dream of: running for the presidency of the 
United States of America - and winning. 

George Bush would be without peer as the most successful politi-
cian in America today - if Ronald Reagan weren't still on the job ... 

M y friend Skinner called me from Washi ngton the other night, and his voice was crazier than usual. He was visiting with his publisher in a massive suite at the Watergate, he said, but the 
publisher had suddenly gone "sideways" on him and was threatening to 
cancel the contract fo r his new book of memoirs about life in the Black 
Lane. 

"We were talking about Gadhafi ," he said, "and the guy suddenly 
asks me what kind of crimes he'd committed - like how many 
atrocities and what acts of terrorism?" 

"Jesus Christ ," I said to him. "The list is too long. He's worse than 
Ghengis Khan." 

" But the guy didn't blink. Hejust kept staring at me, like some kind 
of maniac Jew, and all he said was, 'Tell me about it , Skinner. We all 
know Gadhafi is a monster, but now we will finally have proof - and 
let me tell you something, Big Guy, I know a best-seller when I see 
one, and I think I see one here.' All I had to do was relax and cough 
up the details." 

"You fool!" I said . "Why are you calling me? You need Room 
Service. Get a world atlas and one of those big-bore yellow-tip 
marker pens, and then tell him that horrible story about how you and 
Moammar butchered those quislings down in Zillah . He'll sign any-
thing after he hears that one ." 

" No," he said . "I lied . We never killed anybody in Zillah . It was 
whis key. Moammar can't drink. He 's worse than Nixon." 

"So what?" I snapped. "Tell him another one. You can always tell 
the one about how he strangled those frogmen on the beach with his 
!>are hands and then made you burn the bodies." 

"That was all lies," he said. "We were drunk . It never happened ." 
I was shocked, and Skinner was sobbing quietly at the other end of 

the line. 
" Please help me," he whispered . "All I need is a good rumor." 
"No," I said . "You need Oliver North's home phone number. He 's 

the only one who can help you now." 
"Jesus !" he said . "I think you're right. He will be like Paul New-

man: People will believe everything he ~ays." 
Indeed, and score another one for Dutch. He i still taking care of 

his boys. Ollie was framed by liberals, and George will be his kind of 
president. The deed is done. The fat went into the fire a long time ago. 

Letters 

Time for A.S. 
to Work 
Editor: 

In a letter entitled " Dimmes-
dale Twists Facts," [Guardian 
Jan . 9] Gayatri Gunasekaran has 
represented me as saying that the 
problems that generated the A.S. 
Document " Student Input in 
Campus Policies Resolution" 
were largely the fault of past A. S. 
Councils. While I do not think 
that Gayatri necessarily intended 
to twi t some facts herself, her let-
ter is certainly symptomatic of the 
kind of problems within the A. S. 
which caused the resolution to 
have to be presented before the 
Council three times before it wa 
voted into effect. 

The fact that past Councils 
were "derelict" in their responsi-
bilities was certainly a contribut-
ing factor in the UCSD Adminis-
tration's neglect in the solicitation 
of student input in their policie 
affecting st udents, but it was not 
our underlyi ng reason for formu-
lating the resolution. The policy 
review committee (which should 
have included two students but 
included only one) was never 
convened by the Office of Under-
graduate Affair . 

Ni c holas Aguilar of 

,.,r 

Undergraduate Affairs instead 
drafted a revised policy and 
mailed it to the committee 
members for their opinions . 
What he liked he included in the 
revision, what he didn't like he 
didn't include. This was not the 
procedure established in the pre-
vious policy for future revisions. 
That policy required that student 
opinion be solicited and imple-
mented . This was not the case. 

I first pointed out the problems 
with the review process to Under-
graduate Affairs in Fall 1987. 
There were more problems which 
I do not have the space to men-
tio n here, but it is now dish~arten­
ing to find out that some Council 
members still do not understand 
why we voted in the resolution . 
The passage of the resolution will 
not "void all the committee's 
work" as Gayatri wrote; the 
"committee" never did any work; 
the Administration has done all 
its work in submitting a revised 
policy draft ; it is now time for the 
A.S. to do its work. 

On several occasions Council 
members had the opportunity to 
question me about the re olution. 
Very few did . At one Council 
meeting Mr. Dimmesdale and I 
a ked for a Council Caucus 0 
that we could speak about the 
resolution and so that Council 
members could ask questions 
about it in an informal discussion. 
We had our caucus, but a large 
number of council members had 

already decided not to listen to 
the discussion, electing instead to 
talk about other things in a very 
loud manner among themselves 
to the point that no one could 
hear themselves think. 

The resolution was voted down 
later that evening. It was later 
taken up again by myself and a 
senator who was willing to take 
the time to review and understand 
the complex policies: Alex Wong. 
When the resolution did pass, a 
few Council members left the 
room so that they would not have 
to vote, but the majority of the 
Council voted for the resolution. 

It is my opinion that what the 
Council needs to do is listen to 
each other a little more carefully 
before jumping to conclusions 
about the issues. If we do this, our 
meetings will be more productive 
and will probably not drag out as 
long as they do now. 

Yes, there has been much 
internal conflict in the Council 
this year, but there has been far 
less conflict between the Council 
and external organizations, in 
particular the alternative media, 
this year. This is indeed a good 
sign. I would encourage the 
Council to put personal feelings 
for each other aside and get down 
to doing the work that the student 
body entrusted us to do when we 
were elected or appointed. This is 
our responsibility. If we do, our 
best days will bc yet before us.

The UCSD Guardian OPINION Thursday, January 19. 1989 
______________________ ~--~~~~------------______ ~ __ ~~5 
Normal 

Continued from page 4 
Is there any political di cour e 

on campus? How can there be, 
w~en everybody agrees on every-
thIng? The campus is unifo rmly 
and blandly left-wing. Lectures 
and a rticles are simply endless 
affirmations of support for femi-
nism, gay liberation, black 
conscio usness-raising, latino 
rights, affirmative action, third-
world supremacy, etc .. etc. and 
every other kind of Give-Me-
Mine-ism that you can imagine. 
In spite of this , are there many 
blacks or latinos enrolled? No. 
They simply don't get the pre-
paration for even UCSD's modest 
requirements in Ca lifornia's 
crumbling public schools. 

"Are you leaving? Can I have 
your space?~ He drives home again 
and goes skateboarding or bar-
hopping or watches MTV or 
whatever undergraduates do when 
they're not on campus. 

Does the University have any-
thing surrounding it that resem-
bles a neighborhood? Or is it sur-
rounded on two sides by empty 
canyons where illegal aliens live, 
on one side by freeways, and on 
the remaining side by condos 
spaced thisclosetogether? In fact, 
didn't they University sell that 
adjacent land to developers so 
they could put up 300 condos, a 
convention center, and a hotel, all 
to be served by one 
already-choked road? In fact, 
doesn't Interstate 5 actually cut 
right through the campus? 

Are there grass and trees on the 
campus? Or sprawling parking 
lots and dirt? Granted , there are . 
eucalyptus trees planted in the 
dirt. But they are planted too 
close together so that they grow 
tall and weak and spindly, and 
now the eucalyptus beetle is kil-
ling them. 

appeared thi s fall and I think it's 
what finally pushed me over the 
edge. 

In short , is there anything at all 
a bout this place that is not shal-
low, vapid, superficial , ugly, 
crowded , dirty, bizarre, inefficie nt , 
and out-of-control? 

If the answer to one or more of 
these questions is "yes," Matt, 
then I suggest that you not con-
sider such a place for employ-
ment. It has almost none of the 
things that led you into academia 
in the first place. Nevertheless, as 
many will point out, UCS D ranks 
very high in such statistics as fed-
eral dollars to research, faculty 
distinction. sheer numbers of 
publications, memberships in the 
National Academy of Sciences, 
etc. 

Consistently in the top 10 in 
science and technology, which 
must be very gratifying to the 
faculty involved, dnd certainly 
doesn 't hurt my prospects once I 
graduate. I'm not complaining 
for my own sake. But as far as 
teaching and learning are con-
cerned, I'm afraid we were spoiled 
by our alma mater, of which this 
place is only a pale imitation.

Save The Language 
Editor: 

Alrigh~enoughisenough. The 
humor in the term "freshperson" 
has been exhausted . 

The Guardian has so ld out to 
high-pressure groups and betrayed 
those of us who still believe in 
good old-fashioned grammatical 
English. 

As a woman at UCSD, I consi-
der myself equa l in every way to 
my male counterparts, as much as 
two unique individuals can pos~ 
sibly be. I believe I a m included in 
Lincoln 's speech at Gettysburg 
when he ays that "all M EN are 
created equal." And yes, I am a 
freshMA . 

I suppose those who disagree 
with me will never be happy, but 
the English language mu t be 
preserved some how. If every spe-
cial interest group was allowed to 
remove offensive language from 
the dictionary, after all, imagine 
what a limited vocabulary 
America would be left with. 

Phrase such as "BLACK eye," 
"luck '0 the IRISH,''and "in the 
RED" would be erased from our 
minds, being considered racist 
terms, and at heis ts would rewrite 
our Pledge of Allegiance, Con titu-
tion, and the "E Pluribu Unum" 
and " In God We Trust" slogans 
on every dollar bill to remove the 
concept of God entirely. 

Really , if this non-sexis t propa-
ga nda co ntinues any further, 

"huMANity" and "perSON" and 
even the entire meanings behind 
"fi:mininity" and "masculinity" 
will be destroyed. 

Please, spare us the gratuitous 
formalities. Let us get back to real 
English. Remember? It's the rich, 
beautiful language we all grew up 
with, with all its colloquial terms 
and figures of speech.

Staff Writer 

Visiting Columbia University 
Profe sor Edward Said, an active 
spokesper on for the Pale tinian 
cau e, will be giving his second 
lecture this evening. This lecture, 
spon ored by the literature depart-
ment, will examine "The Voyage

his stay, Said i teaching a gradu-
ate eminar in comparative litera-

Hi first lecture, sponsored by 

the political science department 
was titled "The Palestinian Prop-
osal for Peace." The lecutre was 
part of an attempt to increase 
awareness of all political is u es 
and the political science depart-
ment does not endorse any indi-
vidual view. The role of the politi-
cal science department is to 
"support the broadest spectrum 
as possible" in political lectures 
and to "support a wide range of 
point of view on an issue," Depart-

Dr. Masao Miyoshl of the literature de part ment asked Said to leclure 
on pol itics in the Middle East.

aid, here as a visi ting profes-
sor for two weeks beginning Jan. 
9, was orginally scheduled to 
present only one talk on litera-
ture, sponsored by the depart-
ment of literature. This lecture 
will take place tonight, Thursday 
at 8 p.m. in Mandeville Auditor-
ium. 

He was asked to add a second 
lecture on Palestinian politics by 
a friend, Dr. Masao M iyoshi of 
the UC D literature department. 
This lecture was held last night. 
last night . 

Mi yoshi and Dr. Herbert 
Schiller of the communications 
department 'are the cofounder of 
the fledgling campus organization, 
Faculty for Peace and Justice in 
the -Middle East. Twelve profe -
ors a t UCSD have joined the 

commillee so far, which is con-
cerned with Palestinian issues. 

One member, Dr. Strong, stated 
that Said's visit served as a cata-
lyst for the idea of the Faculty 
formation, but because the group 
has yet to be formally recognized , 
it was unable to. sponsor Said's 
lecture. 

Other members include Dr. 
Peter Irons of the political science 

'department, Dr. John Dower 
from the department of history 
and Robert H orwitz .from the 

communicatic!'~ department. . 
Miyoshi only recently began 

forming the committee, th-erefore 
the members haven't held a meet-
ing yet ~ o outline specific goals 
a nd plans of action. 

General goals (or the group, 
though , included h'aving "an 
international forum to talk about

"creating a n a rena for discussion ,

Irons stated that the promotion 
of a "settlement of the Middle 
Eastern ituation, particularly 
with re.spect to the rights of the 
t:'ale tinian people," is also an 
aim of the organization. 

"The central premise" of the 
Faculty committee is to encour-
age "a negotiated -solution to the

I f classroom walls are starting to clo e in on you but you 
can't afford to take time off 

from school, then Semester at Sea 
might be just the thing for you. 

This program, which is spon-
sored by the University of Pitts-
burgh, allows students to travel 
around the world on a n 18,000-
ton cruise ship while still main-
taining the-ir studies aboard the 
ship . The S. S. Universe is 
equipped with classrooms, a li-
brary;'a darkroom, a theater, an 
M . D:-staffed . hospital, sports 
facilities, a swimming pool and

to such diverse nations and Japan, 
Hong Kong. I ndia, Turkey, the 
Soviet Union , Yugoslavia and 
Spain . However, specific ports 
vary depending on the semes-
ter and whether countries are 
unsafe for travel due to political 
unrest. 

Becky Tucker, a Warren jun-
ior who also recently returned, 
said she enjoyed all the ports . " I 
loved every country, but each one 
had its high points, ~ Tucker saul. 
"I had the mostJun in Turkey, but 
1 learned the most in India, and 
Mala ysia was the most relaxing." 

Students attend classes six days 
a week when they are at sea, but do 
not have any classes when they 
are in port. The S.S . Universe 
offers the tudents a diverse cur-
riculum from which to choose the 
12-15 units in which they must 
enroll. Each studen.t is required to 
take the core cla.s5 which, as Red-
dish explai ned, 'gave a general 
ovel'Yiew of each country, includ-
ing economics, anthropology, 
music and a few key phra es in the 
native language. 

Tucker exp lained that the aca- .

In fact , Reddish said that when 
the trip ended in Fort lauder-

Abroad 
Continued from page 7 
Gamon noted "it is the kind of 
program that is often criticized, 
especially by academics, because 
people are sailing around the 
world and getting academic credit 
for it." However, she said. " It's 
really significant that this pro-
gram gives people exposure to a 
variety of different cultures ... 
and many are Third World cul-
tures , not just Western cultures." 

Applications for Semester at 
Sea are available in the OAP 
office. There is no application 
deadline; it is on a first come, first 
serve basis. 

In order to apply, a student 
must be in good standing at an 
accredited university , must have 
completed one full college term 
and havea GPAof2.75 . However, 
Gamon said the GPA requirement 
is not firm and can be reviewed on 
an individual basis. 

Reddish and Tucker both 
recommended Semester at Sea as 
a highly valuable experience. 
Tucker said that as a result of the 
trip s he feels more secure and 
more appreciative of many things . 
Reddish felt that it "put the world 
into perspective" for her. 

Both students also want to go 
abroad again for, as Reddish said , 
"It's given me the travel bug." 

Palestine 
Continued from page 7 
elected by other delegates . Inde-
pendents are people not affiliated 
with any party - "people from all · 
walks of life," Said remarked. 

The PNC is involved with the 
Palestinian Liberation Organiza-
tion (PLO) in two important 
aspects . The PNC "produces pol-
itical resolutions at the end of 
each meeting and it is those politi-
cal resolutions that guide the pol-
icies of the PLO," stated Said. 
The PNC also "elects from its 
own members the members of the 
executive committee of the PL(I," 
Said added . 

Said is a member of the PLC, 
but he has only attended "three to 
four meetings since 1977," he said . 
A member's role in the Council is 
essentially to "discuss, debate and 
vote," he added. 

The last meeting of the PLC, 
which Said attended, was the most 
important meeting Said has 
attended, he said. "Yassir Arafat's 
speech at Geneva last week was a 
result of what happened at the 
PNC," he added. 

Arafat's speech has been hailed 
as a turn-around in Palestinian-
Israeli relations. 

Said wants to address four basic 
topics at UCSD. "I want to cover 
the uprising (also known as the 
inteifada) of Palestinian youthS, 
where it came from and how it 
deals with 21 years of Israeli 
occupation," he said. He will also 
cover "the decisions of the PNC 
as to how they relate to the upris-
ing and the future of the Palesti-
nian campaign for peace," he said. 
Israeli occupation policies will 
also be discussed . 

Said is supportive of Miyoshi's 
Faculty committee. "Anything 
Miyoshi does, as far as I'm con-
cerned, is great," he said . 

" I think it's very important that 
more academics and students get 
involved in this issue because you 
are the leaders of opinion and 
politics in the future," he said . 
"Tremendous c hanges have 
occurred in the last five years 
becau e of committees like Miyo-
shi's and other kinds of commit-
tees," aid concluded .

Another Super Bore? 

By IVAN KRlM 
Contributing Writ~r 

What can football fans expect 
this Sunday? Innumerable hours 
of media hype and pre-game 
talk? Certainly. Lots of com-
mercials showing brawny He-
Men drinking beer? Without a 
doubt . Inane jokes and useless 
information from the commenta-
tors? I'd bet on it. A wonderful 
halftime show? I can't wait. But 
can we football fans ' expect a 
game? 

A game? 
A real game? One where the 

outcome is still undecided after 
the first quarter? One where 
you don't clench up like a 'fist 
after listening to two hours of 
filler from the commentators? 
One where, maybe,just maybe, 
you might be on the edge of 
your seat when the clock is tick-
ing down? 

There is reason to believe we 
can expect no such thing. 

History, for one, seems a 
long chronicle of Super Bores. 

In the decade of the '80s, the 
balance of power shifted from 
the AFC (strong in the '70s) to 
the NFC. The balance may 
have shifted too far. Just try to 
remember the last time the 
Super Bowl was an exciting 
game. The NFC has not only 
won the last seven of eight 
Super Bowls, but it has des-
troyed its AFC opponents. 

Think back: 
Washington crushes Denver. 

New York crushes Denver. 
Chicago crushes New En-

gland. 
San Francisco crushes Miami. 
Etc ... 
Whatever the reasons, we are 

in an age of NFC domination. 
The teams that the AFC sends 
to the Super Bowl are just not 
of the same caliber as those that 
represent the older conference. 
And this makes for very boring 
Super Bowls. . 

So what can we football fans 
expect on Sunday when tbe 
San Francisco 4gers take on the 
Cincinnati Bengals? More NFC 
domination? Another Super 
Bore? The point spread is six 
with San Francisco favored -
but some say that the Niners, 
who have been very hot of late 
in decisively ousting the Vik-
ings and the Bears, will beat this 
spread with ease. History seems 
to side with these people - the 
Niners have beaten stronger 
teams in a stronger conference. 
History always speaks logically. 

But there are some, a brave 
few, who hold that this is the 
year that N FC domination ends. 
They speak of a new "parity" in 
the league this year. They think 
that the underrated, tough, 
Boomer Esiason-Ied Benpls 
can pull off an upset against the 
favorites . 

If they can't, at least let's 
hope they can put up a good 
fight. Let's hope the second half 
isn't just a long epilogue. 

Let us all pray, football fans: 
Anything but another Super 

Bore on Sunday! 

McManus, Armstrong Both Honored 

Soccer Teams ColleetAwards 

Derek Armstrong (left) and Brian McManus led the men's and 
women's soccer teams, respectively, into the Division III Nat ional Title 
game this Fall. 

By IVAN KRIM 
Contributing Writer 

UCSD doesn't have a fight 
song. We don't have a big sta-
dium. We voted down having a 
football team. Hell, except for 
somebody in a Sun God outfit 
who appears once a quarter, we 
don't even have a mascot. 

All this aside, when most stu-
dents think of UCSD sports, they 
probably think of the EECS 
GEEKS and the OLD AMES 
GANG squaring off around a 
chessboard. 

But these students are unaware 
of the real facts. 

Our teams have been walking 
softly but carrying big sticks, yet 
students do not realize just how 
much UCSD sports has been 
accomplishing, even without a 
fight song or a real mascot. 

Our soccer teams, both men 's 
and women's, have become nation-
·al Division III powers. Last fall's 
performance definitely puts our 
program among the very top in 
the country. 

Incidentally, it was the very last 
game, the National Champion-
ship, and it was only after two 
overtime periods and a sudden 
death period that they finally lost 
1-0. 

These are great achievements. 
And now it is time to honor 

these achievements. 
Both the women's and men's 

coaches, Brian McManus and 
Derek Armstrong, respectively, 
have been namtd Division III Far 
West Coaches of the Year. They 
have brought the program to 
where it stands . 

And the All-Americans have 
been named . From the women's 
team, Katy Dulock, the freshper-
son phenom, was named as a first 
team All-American. Dulock broke 
the school records for goals, with 
21, and points, with 47. Senior 
defender Susan Kramer was 
named to the second team. 

For the men, Thien Nguyen, a 
senior midfielder, was elected as a 
third team All-American. Nguyen 
led the team with 15 assists and 
was in a tie for the team lead for 
points with 29. 

Men's Volleyball Looks Tough in 3-1 Loss 
Not that much was made of it 

- perhaps there are those of you 
out there who still do not know 
- but our men's soccer team won 
the Division III National Cham-
pionship this season after going 
undefeated, the first UCSD team 
in history to go undefeated for an 
entire season. Also, our women's 
team lost only one game all year. 

We congratulate the coaches, 
players, and everyone else who 
was part of last fall's spectacular 
season. It's time that you all get 
the recognition that you deserve. 
UCSD may not have a fight song, 
a big stadium, or a mascot, but it 
is slowly becoming - and not just 
in soccer - a serious power in 
Division III sports. We might not 
have a long-standing tradition of 
athletic pride (the outcome of last 
year's fooball referendum can tell 
you that), but all traditions start 
somewhere - as a new trend. It's 
time that we start showing the 
support and affection that our 
teams need and deserve. 

Pepperdine Overpowers Tritons 
By JONCARLO MARK 
Staff Writer 

Pepperdine University's power-
ful men's volleyball team came to 
the Triton Pavilion Tuesday 
night looking for an easy victory. 
The Division.()ne Waves are eas-
ily one of the five best teams in the 
nation with a team consisting of 
incredibly talented players and a 
Head Coach, Marv Dunphy, who 
recently coached the Olympic 
Team. 

Physically, Pepperdine was a 
superior team as their starters 
averaged 6'4 in height compared 
to the 6'0 average height of the 
fritons . What Pepperdine did not 

expect, however, was an intense 
group of athletes from UCSD. 
The Tritons battled and clawed 
all match long, even managing to 
win a set, but finally lost to the 

not-so-mighty Waves 15-8, 15-9, 
13-15,15-12. 

"Overall, the team played well," 
Triton Head Coach Digger 
Graybill stated. "They came out 
with good intensity and good 
persistence ... 

According to Graybill, UCSD 
played excellent "back court 
defense" as they served and dug 
very well . Overall , the Tritons 
committed only 10 service errors 
while accumulating 45 digs. Out-
side hitter Kenny Blackman and 
Nick Rothman compiled 12 digs 
each. 

In the first two sets, the Tritons 
stayed close until the end when 
the Waves were able to pull away. 
It appeared as if Pepperdine began 
to get cocky heading into the 
third set. Although the Tritons 
were playing well, the Waves 
seemed confident they would wrap 
up the match in the third set. 

The set began just a the first 
two did when the Waves jumped 
out to an 8-4 lead. But the Tritons 
held together and began to battle 
back. Key plays by John Lee and 
Steve LaBonge helped even the 
score at eight. The Waves ap-
peared a bit shocked, and began 
making mistakes which UCSD 
was able to capitalize on. Finally, 
with a monSterous spike by ick 
Rothman, the Tritons won the 
set. 

But that would be all, as Pep-
perdine rallied and won the final 
set 15-12 after a 12-12 tie. 

In Graybill's opinion, the team's 
performance was encouraging, but 
not satisfying. " We won't be satis-
fied until we win the game." he 
pointed out. The Tritons host 
back-to-back games this Friday 
and Saturday night again t Cal 
State Long Beach and Cal State 
Northridge at 7 p.m. in the Triton 
Pavilion.

PHIL'S ANALYSIS ... Well, here we are. Here's 
the pick that you've all been waiting for. But why? I've 
already picked the Niners on two other occasions this 
year and won both of them, so obviously ['m going to 
go with them again. Besides, if you ask anybody in 
Vegas, they'll tell you never to bet against the Niners, 
no matter what the spread. First, let's take Rice and 
Montana. Here you have perhaps the greatest 
quarterback-receiver combo in footba ll history, and 
guess who 's getting all the media attention? Ickey 
Woods and his stupid shuffle. The funny thing 
though, is that the only time America's gonna see him 
do the shuffle is when he shuffles off the field after Jeff 
Fuller rocks his world on a safety blitz. If the 4ger 
secondary can do the job on the Bengal receivers, 
you're going to get tired of seeing the San Francisco 
offen e romp all over a bewildered Bengal defense. 
But don't count on it. This might be the first exciting 
Super Bowl in years, and could very well be decided 
by a touchdown . So, Phil wants you to give six and ...

SLAM HOLE 
Congratulations to this quarter s first Bud Team. 

SLAM HOLE, last year's AAA slow-pitch softball 
champions, decided one-pitch softball couldn't be 
that lough. I guess they were right ! Slam Hole 
defeated theri opponents (who wish to remain ano-
nymous) 33-3. Wow! I guess we know who the pre-
season favorite is. 

Now remember, winning isn 't the only way to 
capture this most prestigious honor. Uniforms, team 
names, and people having a good time are just as 
important. Rumor even has it that buying beer for 
the Bud Man can be very influential . .. but it s 
probably just a rumor. 

Once again, congratulations Slam Hole- THIS 
BUD'S FOR YOU!

Th B t F rmers The P \0 Ins C rdlff Reefers e 
PtlOtos - 0 to bOHom -

A free concert to save a San Diego tradition. 

by laura baker 
staff writer 

You've spent all day confined to 16 inches of sitting space, your hand 
looks arthritic and your head buzzes with the monotonous drone of a lec-
turing voice. The only thing that will bring life back into you is music - a 
beer or two might help, but music, preferably live and original. will defi-
nitely be the crucial catalyst. And then you read this article and find out 
- oh no - the Belly Up Tavem may have to close because a few people 
fail to appreciate the therapeutic quality of music. Instead, they're calling 
it "noise." 

The Belly Up is located off Pacific Highway in Solana Beach's business 
district. Recently, a few of the residents who live in housing overlooking 
the tavem have complained to the owners about the music and noise 
made by patron's as they leave. 

They hove filed a complaint with the Alcohol and Beverage Commis-
sion. which could lead to the loss of the Belly Up's liquor license and the 
possibility of it living up to its name. 

To raise community awareness and rally support, the Belly Up is hosting 
a free concert on Sunday, Jan. 22. A total of 10 bands will play, all local 
talent that either got their start at the Belly Up or depend on it for their 
ongoing success. 

So, here's a great chance to prepare yourself for next week's grueling 
classes and also show how needed a place like the Belly Up is. Irs one of 
the few clubs in the North County that supports local, original musicians. 
Not only has it saved UCSD students from the musical void of the Golden 
Triangle, it has also been Important for students trying to establish them-
selves as professional musicians. 

The Cardiff Reefers, whose original members first met each other as 
students at UCSD, will be one of the bands playing Sunday. They started 
two and a half years ago as a college band. playing on campus and at 
parties. They began playing at the Belly Up about a year and a half ago. 

For the Reefers. to be able to play there is particularly important. 
Besides being "one place that's VefY. reputable," as spokesperson for the 
band Robert Melendez puts it. it's the only place in the North County 
besides Winston's that features reggae. . 

Although for now the Reefe(s goal is not to " make it big" but to simply 
get their music out to as many people as possible, Melendez says the 
Belly Up "gives them more of a sense of a working band." 

With most of the members living in Cardiff, it also gives the band a 
chance to play for their own community. "The Belly Up is just about the 
only club in the North County," Melendez says. If the club were to close, 
the nightlife, as Melendez puts it. "is gonna go out the window." Not 
good news for an area already staNed for live music. 

Another of the bands well known by UCSD students that will be at the 
free concert is Borracho Y Loco. Of the band, Kevin Hart is a communica-
tions graduate of UCSD and Jay Zimmerman a psychology and compu-
ter science major. The band was formed about five years ago by a group 
of friends going to Torrey Pines High School. 

Chris Goldsmith. who founded the band with Hart and is now their 
agent tells of when they thought they were going to get their b ig break 
four years ago. It was at the Fiesta Del Sol in Solana Beach, an event 
sponsored by the Belly Up, where unknown. bands can show their stuff. 
Actually, the owners of the Belly Up didn't like them, seeing them as still 
only a party band and not yet as serious musicians. 

"It ruined It for us for almost a year," Goldsmith recalls. They were given 
another chance to prove themselves and since then have played regu-
larly at the club. They also play about ten other ciubs in the San Diego 
area and have toured around the southwestern states. Just about 
evefYone In the band feels that the Belly Up is the best club that they've 
played in. 

Goldsmith adds that 'lhe North County already experienced one 
tragic loss" when the Old Time Cafe, owned by his parents, closed a 
couple of years ago and was replaced by a hotel. "The problem there 
was that the community did not rally; they just tumed the other way," 
Goldsmith recalls. 

The concert Sunday is one way UCSD students can dispel the myth 
that the only place they hang out In is the library and the only thing they 
get excited about is their GPA s. 

Bill Davenport of the Belly Up asks that people also write letters of sup-
port that the club can submit to the Alcohol and Beverage Commission 
for their hearing scheduled to( Jan. 25. 

We're hoping (the hearing) is going to be really nothing," Davenport

The Dazzle of Peking 
by marci aronovitz 

hiatus writer 

A fabulo us display of art , music and theatre comes to San Diego 
when the Peking Opera graces the Civic Center for a limited engagl'ment . 

This celebrated gro up of 60 , (rom the People's Repub lic of C hina, 
will give three performances in San Diego as part of their national tour , 
which includes 30 o ther states. 

The Opera combi nes all face ts of the perfo rming arts on one stage . 
Viewers are d rawn to the pt'rformers' lavish cos tumes and elaborate 
face painting. Such details transport the audience into a colorful display 
of st ylized acting and Eastern c ulture that te ll stories of passion, tende r-
ness, deceit, ho nor and humor. 

The O pera is unique in that it is a presentation of highlights from fo ur 
operas rather than o ne complete work. 

The perfor mers are accompanied by a l2-piece traditio nal Chinese 
orchestra that provides beautiful music as a framework for high-pitched 
Chinese song. 

Each excerpt presented is introd u ed by a narrator who provides the 
aud ience with a bit of insight and in fo rmation concerning the segment.

. 'January Man' Suffers 
by arthur ash 

hiatus write r 

Kevin Kline, best kn own fo r his 
hilario us pe rformance last yea r as 
Jamie Lee C urtis' o utrageous ex-
C IA boyfriend in " A Fish Ol llcd 
W anda," stars thi s mo nth in 
MG M's la test m ys terv-comellv 
" ,anuary Man." He plays N ick 
Starkey, an eccentric cop rdn-
stat<,d aft"r lea ving under a cloud 
o f sca ndal. 

Th<' fil m is set in a N~w York 
ity und~ r siegt' bv a seri al killa. 

El even women have died in II 
months, and now it is January . 
Forced to respond to mounting 
p ub lic pressure, the mayor of 
New York reluctantl y rei nstates 
Star key, the o nly man he now 
believes can fin d the k iller. 

Starkey, now a fi reman, is best 
desc ribed by one of the police 
captains: " He's no t a policeman, 
he's a beatni k." Whether a beat-
nik , an eccentric or just an eclectic 
- he takes great delight in listen-
ing to wine breathe, solving crimes 
by using a computer , coveting his 
brother 's wife and sleeping w ith 
the mayor's daughter. 

Susan Sarandon plays the wife, 
who, though once in love with 
Starkey, opted to marry his bro-
ther instead . 

As po lice commissioner Frank-
lin Starkey, Harvey Keitel (" The 
Last Temptation of Chris!" ) plays 
a man who, despi te great power 
and position, seems destined to

you? So 

live in hi s youngt:r b ro ther 's 
shadow. 

Mar y Elizabeth Mastrantonio, 
an O scar nominee for her perfor-
mance in " The OJ/or of Money,'" 
plays the mayor 's daughtt' r , Ber-
nadette, who is d rawn into the 
munJer investigation on several 
levels: by hl'r best fr iend's death at 
the hands of the tra ngler, by her 
fa ther 's desi re to protect her from 
the killer , and by he r romantic 
interest and curiousity towa rd 
Nick Stark<,y. 

Meant to explo re the inte rplay 
between personal and political 
situat ions, "January Man" has 
seve ral strengths . There are won-
derful scenes that humoro usly 
expose the sometimes base and 
petty motivations that underly 
public life. 

While consulting wi th the po-
lice com missioner about reinstat-
ing his brother , the Ma yor is 
rudely interrupted by a fuming 
police captain , who is apparentl y a 
former colleague of Starkey'S a nd 
a man h e now hates and does no t 
wa nt to work with again . W hat 
follows is a loud , abusive and very 
fu nny exchange between the three 
men that illuminates their rela-
tionship to one ano ther and [Q the 
cloudy past that saw the depa rt ure 
of the once beloved super-s le uth: 
Nick Starkey. 

In general, however, the film 's 
weaknesses by fa r outweigh its 

C&rl'sJr. 

strengths. Though the narrative 
possesses many of the elements 
that, collected in isolation, could 
make the un folding of the mystery 
deligh tful, the manner in which 
they are d rawn together leaves -
as they say - a great deal to be 
desired. I got the im-pression 
watching this film th~t an attempt 
was made to compress a very rich 
and dense screenplay into a limited 
timeframe. 

Many of the events seem hap-
haza rd and unmotivated while 
o thers, salvagt:able 10 one's mimi 
after the fact, are not given ade-
q uate prepa ratio n and seem 
fo rced. The aud ience is often not 
taken along from point to point, 
and as a result the fi lm-as-mystery _ 
suffe rs. I sense that many of the 
im portant and funny bits in this 
film were left on the cutting room 
floor. 

Th is fil m is also rich with colo r-
ful , interesting charac ters. Saran-
don plays the elegant and snub-
nosed wife of the police com-
missioner who she married de pite 
herself. Mastrantonio is the deli-
cate b ut adventurous daugh ter of 
the mayor. Nick Starkey himself, 
played wo nderfully b y Kline. 
could have easily filled out two 
hours worth of great comedy. 

Yet none of them a re at all well 
developed in this tilm . T he 
audience rarely sees beyond their 
immediate context in anyone 
situation . What results is an 
eclect ic set of such siruations, 
many of which d raw a laugh, but 
are never o rchestrated to pro-
duct: the k ind of comedy that 
comes out of a deep se nse of the 
cha racters and a delight at the 
humorous interplay between them 
as they grow and change.

The Dream Syndicate Finds Reality 
"When 1 started, 1 was always 

on erned with the re pe t of 
peer .. . of mu icians .. . rather 
peers - of musicians - rather 
than the populous. 1 still feel that 
make some money doing this thing, 
but I still intend to make musi I 
like. There is just no limitation to 
what the Dream Syndicate can 
do.'" - Steve Wynn 

No limitation is right. The 
Dream Syndicate is one of those 
band that just won't go away. 
After six years of wowing rock 
critics and adventurous music 
lovers, the Dream Syndicate now 
ha the chance to break through to 
a mass audience that has so far 
excluded them. 

If you think the band is weird or 
punk or particularly avant.-garde 
now, you're way off. Their latest 
album, Ghost tories, on Enigma 
Records, is their most straight-
forward yet. 

The survival of the Dream Syn-

by sascha oginz 
staff writer 

dicate has a lot to do with the 
per isten e of vision and very lit-
tle to do with trategi planning. 
Th band ha endured numerous 
per onnel changes, several record 
releases n four different label , 
and long periods of inactivity 
framed by hecti touring. 

.. uddenly, we're in the weird 
position of being an e tablished, 
veteran-type of band, which is 
great, 'cause we've made it through 
all that," W ynn said . 

Perhap what has kept the 
Dream Syndicate around so long 
is the per istence of key elements: 
Wynn's personal, soul-baring lyr-
ics, the raw-nerve dual.-guitar ap-
proach, the lack of high-tech pro-
duction techniques, and the inclin-
ation to experiment. Although the 
mood and sound change with each 
new release, the band seems to 
keep its bearings like few other 
LA bands of the '80s. 

The music and lyrics on Ghost 

tories have a weary, exp ri need 
gra that say the Dream Syndi-
cate i finally at pea e with itself. 
The p,etension that has obs ured 
their talent in the past has gone, 
and the result is emotionally 
uplifting and very real. 

The title Ghost tories is highly 
appropriate. It seem each song is 
a tale of some creepy, morbid side 
of life. 

The opening track, called "The 
ide I'll Never Show," is a crazy 

tour of a disturbed p yche. It 
eems the chara ter has commit-

ted emotional murder and is try-
ing to plead for mercy from his 
hrink . A earing guitar under-

scores his confession. Despite its 
tone of helplessness, the piece 'is 
very powerful. 

In contrast, " Loving the Sinner, 
Hating the Sin" and Weathered 
and Torn" utilize the Dream Syn-
dicate's post-punk roots to create 
a gutsy, rough rock 'n roll sound. 

The Dream Syndicate (clockwise {rom top): Dennis Duck, Stew Wynn, Mark 
Walton, Paul Cutler. 

" Whatever You Please" and 
"Someplace Better Than This" 
are beautiful hymn-like ballads, 
revealing the pure courage of the 
Dream Syndicate. Both tracks are 
simply Stevp Wynn and piano. 
" Whatever You Please" also fea-
tures Chris Cacavas of Green on 
Red. It seems cathartic for Wynn 
to lay his heart on the line and 
reveal his vulnerable, peaceful self. 

Wynn is a brilliant writer. His 
lyrics are loaded with vivid imag-
ery and symbolic philosophical 
notions. To listen to his singing is 
to hear some incredibly inspired 
thoughts. Backed up by the ta-
lented, biting guitar of Phil Cutler, 
and strong rhythm section of 
Walton and Duck, the Dream 
Syndicate's Ghost Stories is well 
worth listening to. 

Opera 
Continued from page 3 

The first excerpt, titled "The 
Sword is a Gift from Bai Hua," is a 
story of Princess Bai Hua who falls 
in love with a spy sent to investi-
gate the subversive activities of 
her warlord father . Instead ofkil-
ling him, as she is supposed to do, 
she uses the sword meant to slay 
him to entice and arouse him in a 
dance. The dance, beautifully 
done, is designed to display the 
fluid grace and techniques of mar-
tial arts. 

The second excerpt, titled 
"Stea li ng the Stored Sil ver ," te lls 
a story about two snakes trans-
formed into beautiful women. The 
absence of song makes this seg-
ment an amazing example of mime 
and defined movement. 

The finale, titled " Havoc in 
Heaven," introduces China's best-
loved character, the mischievous 
Chaplinesque Monkey King, to 
the Western audience. 

In this segment, the Monkey 
King defies the Jade Emperor and 
generals who seek to punish him. 
Although the story line is simple, 
the parade of Lostumes and acro-
batic excellt'nce provides sheer 
amazement for viewers. 

The Peking Opera will give three 
performances at the Civic Center 
on Jan. 25 at 8 p.m., Jan. 26 at 7 
p.m. and Jan. 28 at 8 p .m. Tickets 
are available at the Civic Center 
Box Office and all Ticketmaster 
locations.

Those that come to see Kevin 
Kline expecting anything like the 
crazy wit and originality of "A 
Fish Called Wanda" are going to 
be deeply disappointed . Although 
Kline's character has the same 
potential f r every bit a much 
charm in thi film as he did for 
crazine in the last, very little of it 
is realized . What often make a 
my tery my terious and a comedy 
funny i good pacing and editing, 
and that, unfortunately, i exactly 
what thi film lack .. .
