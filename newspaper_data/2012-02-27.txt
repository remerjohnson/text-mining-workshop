“I would love for sports to advance to D-I, and they definitely deserve it, but this 
is a case of misplaced priorities at a 
time when student fees are rising. [...] 
The benefits, like name recognition and 
school spirit, are intangible, and the cost 
is too high for something that not every 
student would concretely benefit from.”

From today until March 9, students can vote on the future of athletics and $495 in student fee increases by logging onto TritonLink with user-
name and password. The Guardian offers its special 
D-I election primer; for more information and full 
pro/con statements, go to the official A.S. Special 
Elections page at  http://as.ucsd.edu/ica, the con 
page at reclaimucsd.wordpress.com and the pro 
side at advanceucsd.com.

WHY VOTE?
 

The results of the election — with millions of dollars 
at stake — will affect all students regardless of how 
many people vote. 
 
UCSD elections traditionally have low voter turnout, 
hovering around 20 percent. In 2007, a 55-percent 
voter turnout was enough to almost triple increase 
the then-$95 athletics fee.

FREQUENTLY ASKED 
QUESTIONS

How much do I already pay 
for athletics? 
All UCSD undergraduates 
currently pay a $359 annual 
— or $119.78 quarterly — 
Intercollegiate Athletics Fee. 
This money goes toward 
scholarships, coaches’ 
salaries, and benefits.

If the referendum passes, 
how much additional money 
will I pay? Will everyone pay 
more?
If the fee passes, 
undergraduates will pay an 
additional $495 annually — 
or $165 per quarter — for 
a total ICA fee of $854 per 
year. Students currently 
covered by financial aid will 
not pay the increased fees 
due to the proportion of the 
money that returns to student 
scholarships.

If the referendum passes, 
will UCSD have a football 
team?
No. The fee is solely to fund 
salaries and scholarship to 
move our existing sports 
to Division I. The 2011

LIGHTS & SIRENS

commissioned by the UCSD Athletics 
Department, determined that football would 
cost over $33 million for facilities alone.

If we move to Division I, will any sports 
be cut? What about Title IX?
No. The Title IX Education Code states that 
there should be equal spending in men’s 
and women’s sports; this sometimes leads 
to men’s sports being cut at universities 
with high football spending. This will not 
affect UCSD unless a football team is 
added.

If the referendum passes, will we 
start paying the $495 annual fee 
immediately?
No. Students will not pay this fee unless 
UCSD is accepted to compete into the 
D-I Big West athletic conference. The 
Big West rejected UCSD as a prospect in 
December 2010, opting instead to accept 

the University of Hawaii. If Big West does 
not accept UCSD by Sept. 30, 2014, the 
referendum will be nullified and no fees 
will be paid. 

Which other UC schools are in Division 
I? Will we be playing them?
Aside from UCSD, the only schools in the 
UC system that are not Division I are UC 
Santa Cruz (III), UC Merced (NAIA), UC San 
Francisco (graduate campus, no sports). 
If accepted, we will play against Davis, 
Irvine, Riverside and Santa Barbara. UCLA 
and UC Berkeley are part of the Pacific-12 
conference.

Are there any academically well-known 
schools that are not Division I? 
All of the Ivy League universities are 
Division I. Universities with high academic 
rankings that are not Division I include 
MIT, Cal Tech, University of Chicago, 
Harvey Mudd College and Johns Hopkins 
University. These are all private universities.

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, FEBRUARY 27,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

Arizona teachers had better watch their mouths. A group of Republican legislators from this state are pushing new legislation that will penalize 
public school teachers for not complying with the Federal Communications 
Commission’s regulations on speech and profanity. Labeled Senate Bill 
1467, the legislation will create a three-strike rule against teachers who feel 
the need to drop f-bombs in the classroom. Arizona may have a history of 
unusually harsh laws (SB 1070 comes to mind), but this bill was created 
with a purpose — legislators decided to take action after repeatedly hearing 
complaints about teachers using inappropriate language during school hours.

And the limits they’ve set are hardly absurd. According to the FCC, 
profanity is defined as any language “so grossly offensive to members of the 
public who actually hear it as to amount to a nuisance.” Clearly, the teacher 
misconduct already reported to the legislators posed a nuisance — this would 
simply regulate speech in a way that has been done since the FCC’s formation 
in 1934.

Regulating speech that children are regularly exposed to is not a new feat. 
In Bethel School District No. 403 v. Fraser in 1986, the courts upheld the 
suspension of Matthew Fraser, a student who presented a “lewd” campaign 
speech during a student election. According to the courts, the way the speech 
was delivered in front of the large 600-student audience went against school 
values. Undoubtedly, this case will be brought up in deciding SB 1467. 

The classroom is a place for children to learn — profanity and obscene 
language, when spoken as expletives, are merely distractions. If regulations 
can be placed on television, which children watch in their spare time, it 
isn’t unreasonable to place similar regulations on teachers working during 
federally mandated hours.

Foul Language Distracts from the Purpose of  Learning Ambiguity of  Measure Violates Teachers’ Free Speech

A group of Arizonan Republican lawmakers is backing legislation that could cost public school teachers their jobs if their speech doesn’t 
comply with Federal Communications Commission standards for TV and 
radio, which includes the f-word and more moderate terms such as “shit.” 
Senate Bill 1467 is so poorly written that it infringes on teachers’ First 
Amendment rights by theoretically controlling anything a teacher says 
both on and off school property. 

The proposed penalties range from a one-week suspension for the first 
violation, to being fired after the third violation. The bill allows teachers 
to be fired for a first or second incident if the school finds that this 
punishment is deserved. Most notably, the restrictions apply to any public 
school program from pre-school to public universities.

The ambiguity of the measure’s wording infringes on teachers’ free 
speech rights. The bill says penalties apply to “[people who provide]
classroom instruction in a public school,” but fails to specifically state that 
profanities cannot be heard in the classroom. The bill hypothetically limits 
teachers’ language in private emails, conversations with colleagues and 
even in teachers’ own homes. 

As an added punch, the wording of this bill can even prevent teachers 
from teaching classic literature that contains inappropriate language usage. 

 Schools already have vast jurisdiction over what can be said on school 
grounds, as seen in past court rulings such as Bethel School District No. 
403 v. Frasier. On top of the impracticality of regulating these restrictions, 
bringing this issue to the state level would unnecessarily complicate 
matters. 

The bill is too poorly written, and clearly becomes too intrusive 
regarding what teachers can say, and when.

CRAM SESSION
The 2015 addition of  social science and critical thinking sections to the 

MCAT is a well-intentioned move to make admissions more holistic, 
but the changes will put too much emphasis on non-medical topics.

By Chris roteliuk • staff writer

QUICK TAKES FIVE ARIZONAN REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS ARE ADVOCATING A NEW BILL THAT WILL REGULATE PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS’ SPEECH TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION RULES.

PHOTO ILLUSTRATION BY REBEKAH HWANG/GUARDIAN

When I tell people that I’ve never used Adderall, they’re usually 
scandalized. For as much as those 
of us in the humanities are mocked 
at UCSD, we’re also responsible for 
roughly 3 million pages of reading 

and writing each quarter. There 
is always another paper, another 
book — and like anyone else raised 
on Gameboys and Pop Tarts, my 
attention span doesn’t carry me to the 
epilogue. 

Until recently, my reasons for 
abstaining were somewhat murky, 
even to myself. I’m not a total puritan, 
I care about my grades, and by the 
laws of peer pressure, I should have 
been popping a 30-mg extended 
release capsule for Beowulf years ago. 
As regular readers of this column will 
know (hi, mom!), it’s true that I’m 
a hypochondriac. But even I’m not 
fearful that, if I gave Adderall a try, 
I’d keel over with a heart attack while 
giving my kitchen the most vigorous 
damn scrubbing it’s ever seen.

In some quantifiable way, most 
of my friends who take Adderall are 
better off than I am. They often have 
better grades, more job prospects and, 
if it weren’t obvious enough, they’re 
more productive. They’re likely not 
doing much damage to themselves, 
either: most psychiatrists agree 
that, given you aren’t pregnant or 
using other medications, occasional 
Adderall use won’t have any lasting 
effect on your body. 

But knowing myself, and the 
ungodly amount of caffeine I need to 
function for one day, it’s not hard to 
imagine needing it to work in the way 
that I now need coffee. I may know 
close to nothing about chemistry, but 
I know that this is how addiction can 
start: do something often enough with 
apparently positive results, and you 
will begin doing it more frequently.

Another possibility is that more 
pervasive factors are to credit for 
my restraint here. No researcher has 
yet examined the long-term effects 
of watching “7th Heaven” on naive, 
fearful prepubescent boys, but when 
one does, we may know more on that 
front. 

Mostly, though, I don’t like the 
thought that I could come to need 
a pill for what I’ve been managing 
all along. Yes, like virtually everyone 
who uses Adderall, I’m often stressed; 
and yes, like virtually everyone who 
doesn’t, I didn’t make it through 
Beowulf. 

But for the most part, I get by 
— maybe not with an engineering 
degree, but nonetheless, I get by. I 
get decent grades. I sleep. With the 
reliable aid of just coffee and Beyoncé, 
I’ve survived more all-nighters than I 
could have dreamed. 

I’m still baffled that expectations 
of us are so impossibly high that 
the only way to come close is with 
amphetamines. If they weren’t, and 
if we weren’t in such relentless, 
unending competition with each 
other, this might be a different 
column. But those expectations aren’t 
changing, and there’s no reason to 
think our habits should, either.

Against the 
Odds: Why 
I Don’t Use 
Adderall

Pre-med students, get ready to hunker down for a mental marathon unlike ever before — 
the Association of American Medical 
Colleges (AAMC) has decided to 
make some major changes to the 
MCAT medical school entrance exam. 
Set to take effect in 2015, the new test 
aims to capture a student’s “soft skills” 
of reasoning and relating to patients, in 
addition to the traditional “hard skills” 
of biology, chemistry and physics. 
Shifting the MCAT toward a more 
balanced focus is a promising idea to 
steer students toward developing the 
skills of a well-rounded doctor, but 
the AAMC could fall victim to an 
over-emphasis on education in non-
medical topics, a potentially risky way 
to separate those most qualified.

The new 2015 MCAT is comprised 
of four parts: biological sciences, 
physics/chemistry, behavior/
social sciences (new) and reading 
comprehension/critical reasoning 
(new). The writing portion of the test 
has been removed, because feedback 
from admissions officers shows that 
this section is the least deterministic 
of quality medical students when 
compared to the students’ grades and 
performance on other parts of the 
exam. Each section is worth 15 points, 
for a total of 60 on the test. Overall, 
these changes increase the MCAT 
length by 90 minutes.

Arguably the most substantial 

change to the MCAT is the addition 
of 65 questions on psychology, 
human behavior and social sciences. 
If executed well, this new focus 
could prove very beneficial to the 
medical field. Encouraging students 
to take social science classes not only 
broadens their horizons, it also fosters 
mindsets and communication skills 
that are not practiced in science classes 
— indispensable attributes for an 
industry tied so closely to people.

But the new section poses a 
fundamental hazard: one-fourth of 
the MCAT medical exam will consist 
of non-medical topics. While the new 
reading and reasoning section tests a 
candidate’s ability to connect ideas, the 
behavior and sociology section solely 
quizzes students on their knowledge 
of these non-medical topics. Knowing 
the biological foundations of behavior 
might be sensible, but some of the 
topics listed on the AAMC Preview 
Guide are of questionable relevance to 
being a doctor. The guide states that 
students are expected to know theories 
on stereotypes, discrimination, 
power, prestige, and class, among 
other non-medical related social 
science topics. These abstract topics 
place unnecessary strain on pre-med 
students because students will have 
even more material to focus on that 
is concurrently vaguely related to 
the medical field. Amjed Saffarini, 
executive director of pre-health 

programs at Kaplan Test Prep, echoes 
this sentiment, saying that “Having 
that many more prereqs is not going 
to encourage students to go into 
medicine from the humanities.” 

The opportunity for pre-med 
students to get a well-rounded 
education already exists. In addition 
to core medical classes, students can 
choose to major in any subject they 
want. In 2010, nearly a quarter of 
pre-med students chose a non-science 
major. What unifies such a diverse 
group of students into the pre-med 
classification is their knowledge of 
medical sciences received from the 
core medical classes. Giving significant 
weight to humanities on the test 
encourages students to specialize 
in more social sciences rather than 
extra medical sciences, when deeper 
knowledge in biological sciences is 
arguably the more pressing option for 
doctors.

Statements made by leaders of 
the AAMC suggest the changes to 
the MCAT may not be entirely for 
educational reasons. According to an 
article on InsideHigherEd.com from 
April 1, entitled “Revamping MCAT 
and Pre-Med Education,” the AAMC 
has repeatedly expressed desire for a 
more ethnically diverse medical field, 
and cite low MCAT test scores as a 
major obstacle to that goal. Senior 
director of the MCAT program Karen

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor, 
  As chair of the Committee on 

Admissions, I would like to bring 
attention to inaccuracies that 
were printed in the article titled, 
“UCSD to End TAG Program in 
Fall 2012” in the Feb. 21, 2012 
issue. At UC San Diego, the 
Transfer Admission Guarantee 
(TAG) program will be available 
until Fall 2014. 

This decision has been 
voted on and approved by the 
Committee on Admissions. 
Therefore, students who entered 
a California community college 
up to and including the Fall 2011 
class would, with diligence, be 
able to complete their coursework 
in time to enroll at UC San Diego 
for Fall 2014. |

UC San Diego is committed 
to providing opportunities for 
transfer students to complete a 
four-year degree program. We 
aim to broaden the opportunity 
for more transfer students to be 
eligible for the limited spots we 
do have. 

UC San Diego is dedicated 
to remaining accessible to 
transfer students from California 
Community Colleges.

FAA Combat Drones 
Will Cause Panic   
Dear Editor,

Congress approved legislation 
that requires the Federal Aviation 
Administration to have a plan to 

integrate drones of all kinds into 
national airspace on a wide scale 
by 2015.

The V-1 (also known as a 
flying bomb, buzz bomb or 
doodlebug) was an unmanned 
monoplane that was powered by a 
pulse-jet motor and carried a one 
ton warhead. 

They were launched from 
a fixed ramp and traveled at 
about 350 mph and 4,000 feet in 
altitude, and had a range of 150 
miles. It was 25 feet long and had 
a wingspan of 20 feet. 

One million and a half people 
left London. 

Winston Churchill complained 
that he couldn’t understand the 
panic in view of the fact that 
British and American bombers 
were dropping about a hundred 
tons of bombs on German cities 
for every ton dropped by a 
doodlebug. It must have been the 
technology. 

And judging by the comments 
to the NY Times article “Drones 
Set Sights on U.S. Skies” the 
people are about to do for their 
elected representatives what the 
British people did when they 
turned Mr. Churchill out of 
office.

TAG Program to End 
Fall 2014, Not 2012

Mitchell has made it clear she hopes the new changes 
will help minorities score better on the test and increase 
their acceptance rate into med school. Yet, it undermines 
the purpose of screening for capable doctors to change 
expectations for students who perform mediocre on the 
medical portion of the MCAT. Increased diversity is a 
worthy goal, but changing admission standards is the 
wrong means to that end.

Though there has been a great deal of study and 
consultation with medical school faculty and admissions 
officers before choosing to enact these changes, it remains 
to be seen whether the social sciences section will actually 
hold a huge influence on the test. If the social sciences 
section does turn out to be irrelevant, the method of 
scoring each section individually will provide a safeguard.          

The AAMC claims that performance on the current 
writing section is often ignored by interviewers, (hence the 
section’s removal in the 2015 version), demonstrating an 
interviewer’s power to focus only on the sections they feel 
are important. If the social sciences section does turn out 
to be a flop, it appears interviewers can easily choose to 
evaluate a student’s performance on the medical sciences 
alone.

 There are certainly some concerns with the new 
MCAT test. That being said, the AAMC is an accredited 
group with firsthand knowledge about the needs of the 
medical field. Hopefully the new MCAT is able to find the 
proper balance between medical and non-medical topics, 
and produce well-rounded doctors.

BAY AREA
Whether you’re simply trying to spice up your 

typical hometown visit or a newbie aiming to 
explore the other end of California, there’s plenty to 
do around the Bay Area during the spring time — 
and, believe it or not, the City ‘aint the only draw. 

Airfare comes cheap when you  book in advance, 
or simply hitch a ride with a friend intent on head-
ing home anyway. You might even be able to score a 
free place to stay via your Nor Cal friend, but either 
way, there are youth hostels in San Francisco and 
couch surfing is always an affordable and adventur-
ous option. 

Once there, you’re not going to want to stay 
put for long. There’s a lot more to the Bay than the 
Golden Gate and crooked streets, so use BART (Bay 
Area Rapid Transit) to your advantage, making it 
easy to jump from an afternoon antique shopping 

in Piedmont (Oakland’s bougiest ‘hood) to a night 
raging in the Castro (SF’s gayest ‘hood) without the 
inevitable parking nightmares and traffic across the 
bridge.  

First and foremost, join the great San Diego-
San Francisco burrito war by hitting up one of the 
Mission District’s prime taquerias (Taqueria Cancun 
is a personal favorite) for some aluminum-wrapped 
glory that Chipotle could only dream of.

Of course, the Bay is a foodie’s dream, and burri-
tos aren’t the only dish worth tasting. Clam chowder 
from a street vendor at Fisherman’s Warf is always 
a must, while Oakland’s thriving restaurant scene 
boasts both trendy joints like Homeroom (serv-
ing exclusively mac-n-cheese) and neighborhood 
mainstays like Fenton’s Creamery (made famous in 
Pixar’s “Up”). 

Within this highly cosmopolitan city coined the 
“Paris of South America,” there’s sure to be something 
for everyone, considering its 48 districts — or barrios 
— each come with a distinct personality and flavor. 

Known for its European-style architecture, 
Buenos Aires is laced with a sense of grandeur and 
elegance. The attractive locals, better known as 
porteños (people of the port), don’t detract from this 
either. But woven between the trendy boutiques and 
cozy cafés (the city has a thriving coffee culture), are 
more grungy, run-down parts of town — roughening 
up the polished neighborhoods.

Quaint shops line the narrow cobblestone streets 
of the bohemian San Telmo, the oldest barrio, where 
you can find unique antiques and handicrafts. The 
famous Sunday antiques market is its main attraction, 
though you might just be too engrossed in the sultry, 

seductive tango exhibitions to do much shopping — 
what with all that leg action going on.

Just as attention-grabbing is the lively La Boca, 
located at the mouth of the Riachuelo. Normally 
flooded with tourists, the brightly painted houses 
along the Caminito — some with life-size figurines 
adorning their balconies — are quite the scene. 

On a more serious note (though exciting for 
“Evita” fans), a visit to Recoleta will lead you to the 
mausoleum of Eva Perón, alongside those of many 
other notable Argentineans.

In the largest barrio, Palermo, meat enthusiasts 
will be happy to find some of the best parillas (steak 
restaurants) around. Following a late-night dinner 
(it’s customary to eat at around 10 p.m.), the vibrant 
nightlife will leave you wondering when, or if, the 
city ever sleeps.

Maybe you’re looking into a spring 
break with more than just snorkel-
ing and a botched tan. History nerds, 
architectural connoisseurs or rebels, 
consider booking a flight to Europe’s 
gem of a getaway: Amsterdam.

You probably know the quaint city 
for its accessibility to the pleasures 
denied to you here in the states: weed 
and hookers. Of course, your time at 
the Netherlands can be spent in the 
unconventional “coffee shops” or the 
Red Light district, but we also sug-
gest giving the devil on your shoulder 
a break and exploring Amsterdam’s 
rich cultural history and stunning 
scenery.

Get to know the city by renting 
a bike and riding along the cobble-
stone paths of the downtown, or 

take a trip through its famous canal 
route, which doubles as a perfect 
transportation network to the city’s 
famous tourist sites, such as the Ann 
Frank Museum or, in case that devil 
just won’t pipe down, the infamous 
Museum of Sex.

Also make sure to check out the 
world renowned Flower Garden, open 
during the Spring, for a magnificent 
view of the city’s famous tulips.

While booking that flight may 
leave your pocket feeling much light-
er than usual, cheap hostels are easy 
to find. If you’re willing to compro-
mise your five-star standards, you can 
make do without too much of a blow 
on your budget, leaving you plenty 
of cash for gifts for your sunburnt 
friends back in Cabo.

17-miledrive
Winding through Pacific Grove and Pebble 

Beach on the Monterey Peninsula coastline, this 
legendary scenic drive is literally 17 miles of 
breathtaking views of sea and sky, world famous 
golf courses and exclusive mansions.  

The best part of the drive is discovering nature’s 
treasures. The Lone Cypress is one of California’s 
most enduring landmarks and an eternal symbol 
of the area, while the characteristically turbulent 
waves of the ocean (deeming the coastline the 
“Restless Sea”) contribute to the incredible vista 
down the shore, especially at sunrise or sunset.

A variety of wildlife can also be seen. Bird Rock 

presents close-up views of pelicans, sea otters and 
idle sea lions in their natural habitats. Families of 
deer wander through the forest’s edge, too. 

Golf lovers should not miss the four world-
renowned golf courses along the edge of the 
17-Mile Drive: Spanish Bay, Spyglass Hill, Del 
Monte and Peter Hay. These are popular for trav-
elers and locals alike.

The quality of light and panorama along 
the 17-Mile Drive result in incomparable pho-
tographs, making for picture-perfect road trip 
moments — just make sure to bring along the 
right music and people.

TEARS IN TAHRIR FROM TAMER: ARABIC 
LANGUAGE POP STARS AND THE ARAB SPRING- 
ERC ADMIN. BLDG. ROOM 115
As the events of the January 25th protest movement 
unfolded in Egypt and thousands of people filled 
Tahrir Square, Egyptian singer and actor Tamer “The 
King of Egyptian Pop” Hosny found himself in the 
middle of a European tour. He rushed back to Egypt 
and, like several other Egyptian celebrities, publicly 
supported the regime of Hosni Mubarak. In the eyes 
of many Egyptians, Hosny and other celebrities 
turned against the aspirations of the very youth 
demographic that had previously been their biggest 
supporters. Through both secondary sources, such 
as blogs, and a series of interviews conducted with 
Egyptian youth and Arab music bloggers over Skype, 
Ulaby examines the resulting discourse around 
Hosny and others as a window into contemporary 
Egyptian views on celebrity, popular music, and the 
intersection of art and politics. In particular, he will 
consider the notion of the “carnivalesque”, put 
forward by theorist Mikhail Bakhtin, as a way to 
contrast the resonance and power of music in Tahrir 
Square during the protests and that of the Egyptian 
popular music industry.

khajuraho

salar de uyuni

barcelona

Art is the focal point of Khajuraho, a quiet 
city of just under 20,000, hidden deep within 
the humid forests of Madhya Pradesh, India. 
Khajuraho is best known for its thousand-year-
old temples, which have a cult following among 
designers, painters, myth lovers and history buffs 
from all around the world.

The Khajuraho temples aren’t as famous as 
the Taj Mahal or the Jaisalmer Fort, but they are 
every bit the marvels that their more famous 
counterparts are. Constructed without mortar 
between 900 and 1100 A.D., the temples are 
architectural wonders for their time.

Each temple is about 100 feet tall, built from 
perfectly interlocking stones, with every inch 
of the temples’ outside walls intricately carved. 
Interestingly, the carvings at Khajuraho don’t 
depict gods; instead, they celebrate human life. 
Women put on jewelry and paint their lips. Men 
guide oxen to plough their fields. Musicians per-
form, lovers embrace and artists paint. Though 
it’s hard to see at first, the carvings together 
form a kind of narrative — a loose history of the 

Chandela dynasty that built the temples.
For a UNESCO-designated World Heritage 

Site, Khajuraho is remarkably relaxed and unpre-
tentious. Here, there is nothing you cannot 
touch. The temples were built to be walked in, 
prayed in and individually explored. There are 
no official tours — only private guides and an 
audio circuit on a Discman that can be rented for 
a few dollars at the tourism office downtown.

As long as you stick to the Indian offerings, 
Khajuraho’s food is delicious. Avoid anything 
that advertises itself as international cuisine. At 
a restaurant one night, we ordered “miso soup” 
that turned out to be canned chicken broth with 
enough soy sauce to turn the whole thing black.

Still, Khajuraho’s relative obscurity has its 
perks. Go to a temple on a weekday morning, if 
you can — the complexes are mostly empty then. 
Listen to the chanting worshippers. Watch morn-
ing sunlight color the temples a brilliant shade of 
pinkish orange. And let the still-pristine magic of 
your surroundings carry you back into the past.

In Bolivia, you don’t have to reach upward 
to touch the sky. The country is home to the 
world’s largest salt flat, Salar de Uyani, where 
the sky and ground merge into one. This 
occurs due to a layer of water that collects on 
the plains, creating a bizarre and breathtaking 
reflection — the largest mirror on Earth. 

The salt flat is located in southwest Bolivia 
near the crest of the Andes, totaling 10,582 
square kilometers. There are no signs of life 
for miles, other than fields of cacti and the 
three species of South American flamingos 
that call it home — Chilean, James’ and 
Andean — making the stunning scenery 
stretch out into the horizon.

Tours are offered to explore the plains, 
lasting three to four days as you drive over 
the vast flat land in a 4x4 Land Cruiser.

Due to the harsh conditions of the salt 
plains, certain items are essential. Sunglasses, 
extra water, sunblock and hats are necessary 
to brave the relentless sun and its blinding 
reflection off the salt flat. Coins and small 
bills will be useful because — like most 
things in life — things aren’t free and neither 
are the bathrooms. But most importantly, a 
camera with extra battery and loads of mem-
ory cards is totally essential for the countless 
photo opportunities of your unique trip.

You will not sleep in Barcelona. Count on 
scrounging for a few liquor-soaked hours of slum-
ber in between free walking tours and nightclubs, 
and saving the rest of your recovery for the plane 
ride home — you’ll be far too busy to do any of it 
there. 

Though Barca is a beach town, it’s still too chilly 
to spend your time sunbathing if you’re there for 
Spring Break. That doesn’t mean there isn’t any-
thing to do. The electronic scene is legendary, and 
rightfully so — it’s built around a vibrant nightlife 
with dedicated times for siesta and fiesta (embrace 
local culture and take your afternoon nap at 6 p.m. 
— you’ll need it). 

Though there are some restaurants that open 
earlier for the more conservative tourists, residents 
don’t typically eat until around 10 p.m., and the 
partying starts before the metro shuts down at 
midnight. Luckily, you can avoid the cab fare home 
by cunningly staying out at the clubs and bars until 
5:30 a.m., when the subway starts running again.

Barca’s other draw is its stunning Art-Nouveau 
architecture. Instead of the towering, centuries-old 
cathedrals and castles dotting Italy and France, 

Barca’s principle architectural stars are the works 
of legendary madman Antoni Gaudí, who left 
his “modernisme” fingerprints all over the city. 
Colorful and intricate buildings line the streets, 
literally unlike anything you’ve ever seen — like 
Casa Batlló, the “trencadís” ode to Saint George or 
Casa Milà, known in Catalan as “The Quarry” — 
and the Sagrada Familia, still under construction, 
looms large in the distance. A free walking tour, 
like the “Runner Bean” tours that leave every day 
from the Plaça Reial, will take you to his different 
buildings and explain the history behind each. Grab 
a fresh-squeezed juice from La Boqueria to sip on 
while you walk (but make sure to go inside for your 
purchases. The food on the outer edges is more 
expensive, just because the vendors know tourists 
won’t want to wander in further).

The energy of the city is unlike the old-school 
allure of Rome, or the urban bustle of London. It’s 
a beach town, a party culture and an architectural 
wonderland characterized by a completely different 
era and philosophy of building. Barca’s draw is that 
it’s young: compared to the rest of Europe, it’s like a 
coked-out art student on spring break.

Spend some time in Julian, the 
most delicious little town located 
only an hour and a half west of 
campus. Head down Main Street 
and sample everything apple-based, 
including and especially their 
famous Julian apple pie. If you’re 
feeling especially generous, pick up a 
half-baked pie to bring back to your 
jealous roommates. 

Take a trip to second-rate 
Disneyland. As a cheaper alternative 
to Mickey and friends, Knott’s packs 
the roller coaster thrills of Six Flags 
with the kitschy kiddie fun land 
atmosphere of Disney. 

Take an impromptu, non-
classroom-sponsored field trip to 
Griffith Observatory, a monument 
to public astronomy located at the 
top of Mount Hollywood in Los 
Angeles. Stargaze with your better 
half and observe Foucault’s famous 
pendulum, all outside of the stifling 
confines of a classroom. 

Escape winter by heading to 
the Mojave Desert to rock climb 
and enjoy the scenery, dotted by 
the Joshua Tree for which the park 
is named. Make your stay cheap 
by taking camping gear — nature 
walks, bouldering and stargazing are 
enough activities to bring the Bear 
Grylls out in you. 

Make your out-of-the-area 
friends jealous by posing on top of

MEN’S BASKETBALL —The Tritons 
dropped both their road games last 
week to close the 2012 season, losing 
four of their last five games. 
     On Wednesday, Feb. 22, on the 
road, the Tritons fell to Humboldt 
State by just four points, 72-68. And 
on Friday, in their season finale, the 
Tritons lost 68-72, falling to 11th place 
in the 12-team CCAA conference for 
the second year in a row. 
     Junior forward Justin Brue scored 
18 points and nabbed seven boards 
to lead the Tritons in scoring, but 
the true standout of the night was 
Lumberjack senior 6’6” forward 
Randy Hunter. Hunter scored 
23 points and pulled down eight 
rebounds to lead the Lumberjacks on 
a comeback late in the second half.  
     Down by six points with 4:34 
minutes left in the game, Hunter 
out-rebounded several Tritons, 
putting back his own shot to narrow 
the margin to four points. Triton 
sophomore point guard James 

McCann capitalized on the next play 
with a bucket to put the lead again 
at six points, but Hunter was on the 
move and couldn’t be stopped. Hunter 
charged down the floor, missed a 
layup, got his own rebound and 
tipped it back in. 
     Hunter’s bucket marked the first of 
an 8-4 run that let the Lumberjacks 
take the game. Senior forward 
Christian Hatch had 11 points and 
eight boards, while McCann had 13 
points and six assists. 
     For their final game of the 2012 
season, the Tritons put up a great fight 
against Sonoma State. 
     With only five minutes remaining, 
the Tritons held an eight-point lead, 
due in large part to the efforts of Tyler 
“Lightswitch” McGrath.  Lightswitch 
hit three-of-six three-pointers and 
was perfect from the freethrow line 
to tally 19 points, leading the Tritons 
in scoring. Hatch also pounded in 
10 points and pulled in 8 boards. 
The Tritons trailed by as many as 10 
points in the first half, but battled 
their way back to within six at the 
end of the first period. Carrying good 

momentum into the second half, 
the Tritons out-paced the Seawolves 
16-6 to take the lead in the first seven 
minutes 48-44. 

Still in command with a six-point 
lead, the Tritons lost the ball. In the 
ensuing break, Seawolf Bryan Crowe 
put down a two-handed dunk that 
fed a 8-2 Seawolf streak. The Triton 
turnover brought Sonoma to within 
two points 64-66 with three and a half 
minutes remaining. 

Tied at 68 points apiece, Seawolf 
Steven Pratt — already leading the 
game in scoring with 20 points — hit 
two free throws with 6.4 seconds 
remaining to solidify the win. The 
Tritons’ last play attempt was no good, 
as a haphazard half-court pass was 
intercepted by Sonoma, who trotted 
away with the victory.

“We had two very close games in 
places that are very hard to play in,” 
McCann said. “A couple things didn’t 
go our way late in games but I’m really 
happy about how hard we played.”

Tritons End Disappointing 2012 Season

5-of-9 from behind the arc.
“Daisy was unbelievable tonight,” 

Elliott said to the UCSD Athletics 
Department. “We got a lot of good 
minutes from several people and the 
bench played really well, but Daisy 
really carried us through.” 

The Tritons were excellent from 
the perimeter, shooting 56.3 percent 
from the field, sinking 18 of their 32 
attempts. UCSD overwhelmed the 
Seawolves, taking a 14-point lead by 
the end of the first half, which they 
increased to 20 points by the end of 
the game. Ending the season with 
a 27-1 record, the Tritons now look 

forward to hosting the semifinal 
and final rounds of the CCAA 
tournament. Tournament play will 
begin on Tuesday, Feb. 28 and will 
feature the eight top finishers in 
CCAA play. The Tritons receive the 
first-seed and will face off against 
eighth-seed Sonoma State at 7 p.m. 
at RIMAC arena. 

“Now it’s time to focus on the 
tournament and just take one day at 
a time,” Elliott said. “We are proud of 
what we have done up to this point, 
but now is the time that matters. We 
are 0-0 and a new season has begun. 
We are so glad to be home and hope 
we see a big crowd for us Tuesday 

night.” 
The Tritons will be joined by 

second-seed Cal State Monterey Bay, 
third-seed Cal Poly Pomona, fourth-
seed Humboldt State, fifth-seed 
Chico State, sixth-seed Cal State Los 
Angeles and seventh-seed Cal State 
East Bay.  

The winners of their respective 
matches will advance to the 
semifinal round, to be played 
on Saturday, March 2. The 
championship game will be played 
the following day.

POST PERFECT
BY RACHEL UDA
Sports Editor

On a grainy, halting live feed streamed from a small gym in Arcata, Humboldt, the 
Guardian staff watched senior guard 
Daisy Feder muscle her way into 
the key. With 9.9 seconds left, the 
shooter gave the then-undefeated 
Tritons a tenuous one-point lead 
as Humboldt head coach Joddie 
Gleason called for the timeout. 
The Lumberjacks returned to the 
court to inbound the ball from their 
baseline. Ninety-four feet separated 
them from the Triton basket, but 
UCSD elected to throw out a sloppy, 
undecided press.

The Triton backcourt shadowed 
the inbounders as Humboldt guard 
Kayla Williams didn’t waste any 
time getting into UCSD’s half of 
the court. Williams teetered at the 
top of the key as the Tritons layed 
off. With the clock winding down 

and UCSD cutting off any plausible 
option in the key, Williams took the 
space UCSD allowed her, going in 
hard and pulling up for a midrange 
jumper that gave the Lumberjacks 
the win, 73-74. 

“That was a heartbreaking 
comeback,” Humboldt announcer 
Louise Osborne said after the game. 

The 73-74 road loss was the first 
defeat of the season for the No. 1 
nationally ranked Tritons. And going 
into their match against Humboldt, 
UCSD stood just two games away 
from a regular season perfect record. 

“Honestly, Humboldt was just 
better the other night,” UCSD 
head coach Charity Elliott said. “ 
They made some big shots and we 
came up just short.” Four out of the 
Tritons’ five starters recorded double 
digits. Feder led UCSD in scoring 
with 18 points, while senior guard 
Chelsea Carlisle followed closely 
with 15 points, sinking three of four 
from behind the arc. 

But the difference between the 
two squads may have been on their 
benches. UCSD’s only substantial 
substitute was sophomore sixth man 
Megan Perry, while Humboldt had 
three Lumberjacks who recorded 
time on the court in double digits.

Maybe the difference could have 
been that the Tritons just got off 
to too slow a start. UCSD didn’t 
succeed in cutting the deficit — 
which grew to as much as nine 
points in the first half — until Feder 
sunk one with 10 seconds left in the 
period. The last time the Tritons 
overtook a lead that late in the game 
was six games prior, against Cal State 
Los Angeles.

In either case, the Lumberjacks, 
who also beat Cal State San 
Bernardino in their season finale, 
have now maneuvered themselves 
into second place in the CCAA.

Not many people would have 
picked the Lumberjacks to down the 
Tritons. In the teams’ last meeting, 

UCSD won by a 25-point margin, 
74-49. If I were to put odds on a 
CCAA contender, it would have 
been previously nationally ranked 
Cal State Monterey Bay, who 
the Tritons beat comfortably the 
weekend before 72-64. Despite the 
loss, the Tritons retain both their 
No. 1 national rank as well as their 
regular season conference title. 

On Friday, UCSD capped CCAA 
play with a 78-58 win against 
Sonoma State on the road. Unlike 
their last game, the Tritons started 
off hot, taking a five-point lead off 
of three consecutive three-pointers 
from Carlisle and Feder.  “I think 
[the game against Humboldt] was 
a good wake up call for us and I 
loved how much energy and focus 
we came out with last night versus 
Sonoma State,” Elliott said. 

Feder again led the Tritons in 
scoring again, ending her season 
with a career-high 26 points, going
