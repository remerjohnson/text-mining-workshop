Donald Reidhaar, general 
counsel of the UC Regents 
Friday presented oral 
arguments before the 
California Supreme Court in 
the reverse-discrimination 
case DeRonde v. The Regents 
of the University ofCalifor~lia. 

Reidhaar, in presenting the 
university's case, stated that 
the essential issue is whether 
"a state university -
consistent with equal 
protection of the laws -
(may) give affirmative 
consideration to the race of 
minority applicants in 
making selections for 
admission from among 
Qualified applicants for the 
purpose of promoting 
diversity and enhancing 
minority participation." 

Glen DeRonde, a rejected 
white applicant to the UC 
Davis School of Law, brought 
suit against UC in July 1975 
charging that the school's 
admissions program violated 
the federal and state 
constitutions because it took 
race into account as one of 
many factors in making 
admissions decisions. 

Citing the 1978 Bakke 
decision by the US Supreme 
Cqurt and the 1980 Price 
decision by til!. California 
Supreme Court, Reidhaar 
pointed out that the 
admissions program of the 
UC Davis School of Law is 
valid under both the federal 
and state consitutions. 

"First," he said, "the 
decision of the United States 
Supreme Court in &kke 
establishes that the Davis 
Law School admissions 
progral11 is valid under the 
federal constitution. Second, 
(the California Supreme) 
court's recent decision in 
Price v. Civil Service 
Commission establishes that 
equal protection principles of 
the California Constitution 
tand as no barrier to bona 

fide affirmative action 
programs such as this whi<.:h 
are permissible under the 
Fourteenth Amendment." 

Reidhaar commended to 
the court's speical attention 
some passages from • the 
separate opinion of Justice 
Blackman in Bakke: 

"It is gratifying to know 
that the Court at least find it 
co nstitutional for an 
academic institution to take 

~ace and ethnic background 
mto consideration as one 
factor among many in the 
administration of it 
admis ion program .... 

"I uspect that it would be 
impossible to arrange an 
affirmative action program 
in a racially neutral way and 
have it successful. To a k 
that this be so i to demand 
the impossible. In order to get 
beyond racism, we must first 
take account of race. There i . 
no other way. And in order to 
treat some persons equally. 
we must treat them 
differently. We cannot - we 
dare not - let the Equal 
Protection Clause ~rpetuate

Bus service cut 
causes furor 

One line reinstated 
BY JENIFER WARREN 

Associate News Editor 
A furor over plan to cut 

campus bu ervice produced 
a partial restoration of 
services Friday, but two lines 
are still scheduled to get the 
axe. 

Assistant Chancellor 
Patrick Ledden quickly called 
a meeting which resulted in 
the formation of a new 
proposal: San Diego Transit 
line 30 (to downtown San 
Diego) and North County 
Transit line 301 (north to 
Oceanside) will remain intact 
while SDT lines 41 and 21 
will skirt the campus. 

Ledden called the meeting, 
attended by administrators 
and two Associated Student 
Council members, after a 
story in the Daily Guardian 
Friday informed him of plans 
to cut the 41, 21 and 301 bus 
routes. 
. Ledden was not the only 
one, to receive first word of 
the changes through Friday's 
paper. 

"The'Story was the first I'd 
heard of all this," said Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Richard Armitage yesterday. 

"I was surpirsed. As buses 
are a student service. I 

ordinarily would have been 
informed of such a change," 
he said. 

The change, proposed by 
the Chancellor of Budget 
Affairs Herm Johnson and 
the parking office, would 
have eliminated on-campus 
service via Myers Drive in 
front of the Bookstore by all 
lines except line 30. The 
proposal was a response to 
noise complaints from offices 
along that stretch. 

"The noise complaints are 
legitimate," said Ledden 
Friday, adding that "people 
in the personnel office (along 
Myers Drive) have had to 
stop talking on the phone 
every time a bus goes by. 

"But the compromise we 
have reached will serve the 
critical areas on campus and 
also cut down on noise 
considerably," he said. 

AS Vice President Warren 
Wheeler, who attended 
Friday's meeting, voiced his 
dissatisfaction with adminis-
trative procedure in making 
the cuts. 

Popkin spends 'last days' 
"I knew nothing about all 

this until I read the story 
Friday." said Wheeler, 
adding that "as far as I know, 
the only student aware of the 
chan~e knew by chance. 

"It s thoroughly irrespon-
sible of ~he administration to 
sit in the Chancellor's 
complex and make these 
deci ions without consulting 
those who will be most 
severly affected." 

polling for the Carter ~ampaign 
BY JOHN BRICE 

Staff Writer 
Wh'en UCSD political 

science professor Samuel 
Popkin assumed the role of a 
pollster and advisor in 
President Jimmy Carter's bid 
for re-election, it appeared as 
though beating the Republi-
can challenge would be just 
another textbook case. 

Then came the last two 
days before the Nov. 4 
election, when polls and and 
advice proved useless to the 
failing Carter campaign. 

" For the first time in 
history, there would be an 
enormous, massive surge in 
the last 48 hours before the 
election in favor one one 
candidate," Popkin says. 

He believes that "that 
candidate" - President-elect 
Reagan - did not win the 
election becau se hi s 
leaderh ip wa de ired by the 
electorate. Rather, it was the 
voters' rejection of the Carter 
administration and Demo· 
cratic politics that accounts 
for the former California 
governor's election, Popkin 
ays. 

Popkin defends the validity 
of last·minute polls that 
showed the Carter·Reagan 
race to be very close. He say 
it was the inten e media 
coverage of the hostage 
situation that helped remind 
voters of "the humiliation 
brought on America" during 
the Carter Administration. 
Voters changed their mind, 
he says, simply to erase the 
pain of the pa t four year. 

Popkin says one of the 
reasons Carter lost is that he 
fai led to take adyant~ of his 
incumbance. "Carter sinner 
circle did a poor job of taking 
credit for the good things he 
did," he explains. 

But Popkin admits that 
Carter may have devoted too 
much time to making 
personal. attacks on Reagan. 
It was a case of "Carter losing 
his cooL" 

"You just get heated up; 
it's one of those things, the 
fighter gets out in the middle 
of the ring and starts 
forgetting the game plan, " 
Popkin says, drawing the 
analogy to Carter's campaign 
blunder. 

And this display of 
misdirecton is not uncom· 
mon in recent elections, 
Popkin says. "In these days 
of low party loyalty , it is (the) 
absolute standard for 
standard for the President to 
put the heat on the 
challenger. " 

"Jimmy Carter i not a 
person who ha a lot of 
personal allies," Popkin says, 
explaining the lack of unity 
in this year's Democratic 
party . "His support comes 
from people who have faith in 
certain positions or agree 
with the approache taken .... 
He's a very private man." 

In preparing for the 
presidential debate, held 
just a week before the 
election. Popkin played the 
role of Ronald Reagan in 
pract ice round against 
Carter. But he says that the 

debates were little more than 
"a Quiz show," and that 
Carter agreed to face Reagan 
because backing down would 
have "looked bad." 

Popkin feels, that debating 
has little to do with being 
president, and is a poor way 
to present the candidates to 
the American people so that 
they can decide for whom to 
vote. "The way you get to be 
president develops talents 
that have nothing to do with 
running the country." 

Wheeler added that "it is· 
discouraging that, as a 
student and as AS vice 
president, I have to find these 
things out through the 
Guardian. " 

Armitage also admitted he 
was discouraged by the lack 
of student input solicited by 
the administration in this 
matter.

Greer - nothing more 
than a 'charlatan' 
Editor: 

I always thought that Ms. 
Germaine Greer was one of 
those formidable feminists -
a little loud but sensible and 
sensitive to the cause of 
women's liberation . After 
watching her perform 
Thursday night, I am wholly 
convinced that she is nothing 
more than a modem-day 
charlatan - full of sound and 
fury, signifying rubbish. ' 

She has of late declared 
herself an expert on art - or 
at least the history of women 
painters . Her book, The 
Obstacle Race. is in fact 
enlightniog and attractive; 
her lecture appearance at 
Mandeville Auditorium on 
Nov. 6, however, was quite 
another matter. Yes, it was 
amusing and vaguely 
informative, but toward the 
end, it became downright 
alienating - so much so, that 
at least this feminist could 
hardly keep her seat. 

Germaine Greer has 
fashioned herself a spokes-
woman on women and the 
artistic world. But her 
message to women is: 

- Do not rompete. with 
men in the traditional game 
of art-begetting! Of course, 
Ms. Greer has nothing but 
disdain for the world of 
museums, art cataloguing 
and scholarship - so why 
does she collect art herself, 
and add to the heap of 
meaningless scholarship by 
writing her own book? 

- Channel your "femi· 
nine'" energies (and 
"feminine" is indeed what 
she means. despite her 
vehement and touchy denial) 
into ~erating a sort of 
feminine art, which she

- Women artists should 
never marry male artists 
because inevitably they will 
become sexual victims in a 
battle of egos. In such 
marriages, it is women and 
not men who will suffer 
emotionally and fail as 
artists. 

On top of these pronoun-
cements, which speak for 
themselves, she capped off 
her visit by throwing about 
her pseudo-feminist weight 
in attacking a question about 
the clarity of her expression. 
which at that point seemed 
not only logical but also 
necessary.

Rock C01.lrse receives harassment from university 

Editor: 
A gross example of 

sustai ned censorship, 
dictatorial harrassment and 
undue lack of process has 
been perpetrated by this 
"university." 

I am now teaching for full 
university scholastic credit, 
for the fourth time in the past 
three years, "Roll Over 
Beethoven: Rock music from 
the 50s to the 80s through 
and under the auspices of 
UCSD Extension and the 
Department of Music_ My 
credentials are impeccable, 
and the course is academical-
ly sound - hard-nosed but 
fun - and has been 
entusiastically received by all 
who've taken it, for credit or 
not, which includes, 
incidentally, a number of 
local d-j's and at least one 
music critic of a local daily 
newspaper. Enrollment 
peaked last spring at 43, and I 
have repeatedly told the 
powers-that-be that I could 
dou ble that maximum if 
certain concrete suggestions 
were followed . 

However, I and the course 
have received nothing but 
harrassment from the 
university. The two thesis 
sentences in the original 
course description in ExPlore 
(Extension's catalog) were 
censored as a condition for 
the course being offered a 
second time. The first three 
words in the title - " Roll 
Over Beethoven" - were 
censored as a similar 
condition for the course being 
offered this fall, with the 
additional statem~nt that no 
reference could be made to a 
classical musiciall, Both 
actions were unilaterally 
committed by _Roger Rey-
nolds. Chair of the Dept. of 
Music, and administrator 
Caleb Lewis. 

The two censored senten-
ces are: "The most exciting 
music being created today is 
composed by electric rock 
musicians. If FranZ" Liszt and 
Lord Byron were alive today, 
they'd be plugged in, turned

That is, at the very least, a 
defensible hypothesis. Is not 
the university supposed to be 
the place where new ideas are 
tested, not terminated? Even 
as one in literature and 
philosophy, I am quite 
certain that I know more 
about Liszt than Reynolds 
knows about Byron, and my 
contention for both is all but 
established by historical and 
comparative scholarship. 

to return my calls, emphasiz-
ing by letter that she had the 
power to cancel (I never 
doubted that!). I went up one 
step to Mary Lindsenstein 
Walshok, who taked a bit 
with me but constantly 
interrupted me and finally 
would not let me finish . She 
thinks the course is about pop 
music, which is like thinking 
UCSD astrophysicist 
Margaret BurbIdge is an 

. exobiologist. And in a letter 
afterWards, Walshok baldly 
states the course is not for 
credit! One more final step up 
to DI".an Martin N. Chamber-

lain who refused to talk and 
hung up abrul?~ly on me. End 
of channels. (You remember 
from the 60s when we were 
told to go through the 
channels?). 

Many other lesser inci-
dents have occured, but you 
expect those. They are par for 
the course for the pissant 
population of the American 
university (see Thorstein 
Veblen). I'm more used to 

dealin~ with honest, 
responSIble, open human 
beings who enjoy and respect 
new ideas . (Astronomy 
magazine, largest and 

classiest in its field in the 
world. recently printed an 
essay of mine on rock music 
- and they're sending my 
wife and me to the Jet 
Propulsion Lab to write 
about the Voyager 1 fly-by of 
Saturn this week.) I like the 
course - it's a ~ one and I 

~njoy teaching It. It's also an 
Important and necessary one 
for anyone who wants to 
know what's what in music

Even if it were not, neither 
Reynolds nor any other 
administrator at UCSD 
would be in any position to 
refut it because no one -
repeat, not a single faculty 
member or administrator -
has visited a session of my 
class even once. Talk about 
academic fascism! In fact, 
Roger Reynolds even offered 
a competing course whose 
description took gratuitous 
and unfounded potshots at 
mine. fulminatin~ against 
the popular musIC "heard

The course has been 
threatened three times with 
u.nilteral cancellation . I \ 
discovered accidently just in 
time to get Caleb Lewis to 
reverse the decision the first 
two times. This fall the third 
cancellation has occured, this

mean? In ten years of riding 
SD Transit buses I've only 
seen the utmost safety 

practiced by the drivers. 
Maintenance concerns? Huh? 

All right, Mr. Chancellor 
you make me take a "fair" 
walk to my 8 am math class 
so you can snooze undisturb-
ed_ But I'll tell you 
something, Pops_ Despite the 
obstacles the administration 
throws in front of commuter 
students, I'm going to 
graduate from UCSD if I have 
to start living in the canyons

was supposed to meet with 
members of one of Salvador's 
numerous death squads. At 
the , last moment her 
interpreter lost his courage 
and fled. She opened a door 
and ou t of the darkness a 
voice speaking in a perfectly 
unaccented American 
English said: "Do YOU have 
any last requests?" "How 
about a beer and we can sit 
down and talk about it?" she 
said, which is what they did. 

Unfortunately, not all 
stories about covering 
Salvador end so pleasantly. 
Rene Tamsen, a Salvadorean 
with permanent US residen· 
cy, was ' trying to make 
contact with the left for the 
Howard University radio 
station in Washington, DC. 
last spring. One day armed 
men in civilian clothes 
dragged him out of a car he 
was riding in. "Prensa! 
Prensa!" (press, Press) he 
shouted as he was shoved 
into a second car and driven 
off. He has not been seen 
since. 

On the afternoon of July 
11th, two reporters from the 
opposition paper La Cronica. 
considered to be the best in 
the country in terms of 
honesty and accuracy, were 
abducted from a downtown 
San Salvadot restaurant by 
four gunmen. "They were 
tortured for six hours before 
they were killed," says Harry 
Mattison, a Time photo· 
grapher and friend of the 
dead men. "They chopped 
them up with machetes, 
butchered them, realry. It 
was a very sick act. Jaime 
(Suarez, 30) was a really good 
friend and a really 200d poet. I 
still have some ofnis poems, 
Cesar (Najorro, 28) was a 
serious and dedicated 
reporter." 

The international press 
corp has usually been given 
warnings of actions being 
contemplated against it. A 
Gennan reporter for Dtr 
Stern, following publication 
of an article critical of the 
right, received an unmarked 
letter at his home in 
Germany inviting him back 
to EI Salvador on a one-way 
trip. A less su btle approach 
was taken with New York 
Times reporter Alan Riding, 
who was simply told that he 
would be killed if he returned 
to San Salvador. 

A photographer for the 
Mexican newspaper Uno Mas 
Uno was kidnapped, taken 
out to the co~ntryside and 
made to kneel down in a field.

New manager preserves bike shop 
Macklin comes to UCSl) with 
experience, ideas for local cyclers 

BY BLAKE SHAW 
"Where's Dean?" 
That question is often 

heard around the UCSD Bike 
Shop these days. ever since 
Dean Patterson. former shop 
manager and cycling coach, 
left for "bigger and better 
things." 

Patterson departed in late 
October for Palo Alto, home 
of his fjancee, where he will 
assume the position 'of 
general manager of Avocet, a 
manufacturer of professional 
quality bicycle parts. 

Replacing Patterson is_ 
Bruce Macklin, who arives 
wi th no shortage of 
experience in running a bike 
shop. Macklin has been an 
assistant manager of one of 
the Los Angeles Bikecology 
bike outlets, and most 
recently served for five years 
as manager of the UC Santa 
Barbara bike shop, which 
oeerates much like UCSD's 
bike shop. 

Mackhn foresees no major 
changes in the operation of 
the shop. It will continue to 
sell bicycle parts (rangin 
from economical replacement 
parts to high quality parts). 
new bicycles and accessories. 

Macklin encourages 
anyone with suggestions for 
the shop to talk with him as 
he wishes to run a shop 

. which will best serve the 
students. 

The shop is not ,. and will 
not be a co·op, with students 
volunteering time in 
exchan~e for privileges, he 
emphaSIZes. An employee of 
the Bike Shop must have 
specialized knowledge of 
bicycle repair, parts and 
sales. as well as the ability to 
give advice to customers. 
Each mechanic Macklin hires 
must have bike related 
experience or must go 
through an extensive 
training program. 

Similiarly, he sees little 
chance in the near future of 
reinstating a tool loaning 
procedure , which was 
discontinued last Spring. 
This program, which allowed 
student use of the Bike Shop 
tools, was ended primarily 
due to thefts of expensive 
tools. The shop also has an 
extreme shortage of repair 
space and mechanics are 
constantly bumping elbows. 
More bodies in the repair area 
is not only a nuisance, but 
can be dangerous. 

American habit of a 
sedentary lifestyle and 
constant car use. 

He firmly believes that the 
bicyCle can challenge the 
automobile as a major form of 
intra·city transportation in 
the US, as it does in many 
countries of the world. With 
oil prices soaring, the bicycle 
appears the most sensible 
andleastexpensive transport· 
.lion alternative, and it 
provides g~ exercise. too. 
. A few years ago com pia ints 
from local bicycle shops 
about competition from the 
UCSD shop were frequent. 
This criticism has since 
su bsided, however, and 
Macklin is striving to 
maintain friendly relations 
with local stores. Expanding 
the network of bike paths in 
San Diego, especially those 
which would benefit UCSD is 
one area Macklin and local 
shop owners are investigat· 
ing to~ther. A northward 
extensIOn of the Rose Canyon 
path to Genessee Highlands 
is one route now being 
examined. 

Brucke M.cldia, new Bike Shop maaaJler, displays IIOme 
of the equipment he and his cycle mechanic8 U8e to keep 
many UCSD atudent. on two wheel a. 

The shop will still provide a 
repair service, and Macklin 
also teaches a preventive 
maintenance class on Wed· 
nesday evenings to help 
students keep their bikes out 
of the repair shop. 

Macklin enjoys running a 
shop on a college campus. He 
sees students as being much 
more open·minded about 
using bicycles as an 
alternative to the typicaly 

Macklin also hopes to 
assist Paul Vine, the new 
student·coach of the UCSD 
cycling team, in his efforts to 
improve the squad. While 
Macklin was at UCSB that 
school's team won the 
VVestern Intercollegiate 
Cycling Championship three 
out of five years.

US scrambled jets 
to intercept Soviets 

HAMPTON, Va. AP -
US jet interceptors were 
scrambled twice in Septem· 
ber to shadow Ru ssian 
bom bers flying 200 miles off 
the Virginia coast, the Air 
Force says. 

The supersonic F·I06 
fighters were launched from 
Langley Air Force Base here 
Sept. 18 and again Sept. 24 as 
the prop ·driven Bear 
bombers prowled just outside 
US airspace. 

It was the first time since 
1977 that Soviet bombers 
strayed close enough to the 
US coast to scramble 
Langley's F·I06s for an 
intercept. 

"They're constantly out 
there, p,robing our air 
defenses, ' said Lt. Col. Don 
Carson. the squadron's 
operations officer. 

But Carson said the 
bombers did not violate US · 
airspace. The US maintains a 
protective buffer, called the 
Air Defense Indentification 
Zone, about 200 miles around 
its borders. 

All unknown aircraft 
within that space must be 
identified by US jet fighters. 

"One of those airplanes 
was really shiny, like it was 

their static·display air· 
plane," one of the F· I06 
pilots , said Capt. John 
Swenson. 

Swenson said Friday that 
he was involved in the Sept. 
18 intercept that shadowed 
two Soviet bombers off the 
coast for 40 minutes. 

The 155·(oot Bear bomb· 
ers, bristling with 23 mm 
guns, routinely fly between 
Cuba and the Soviet Union. 
Their course takes them over 
the North Pole and along the 
East Coast.

The Club used to soar at 
Torrey Pines Glider Port, 
which is world-famous 
because of its excellent ridge-
soaring conditions. Last year, 
however, CalTrans closed 
the port to sail planes because 
the area was ~owing too 
crowded with sail planes and 
hangliders . Sail planes. since 
they are an aircraft, fall 
under Federal Aviation 
Administration regulations 
and hence were the first to be 
prohibited from using the 
strip. 

"Torrey Pines is one of 
only four places of its kind in 
the world," Stone told us. 
"There are some others in 
Hawaii where duration 
records of two to three days 
have been set, but we'd really 
like to keep Torrey as a place 
for gliding." 

Monday, November 10, 1980 

for the right amount of 
money. Some high-perfor-
mance models, complete with 
a motor for self starts, sell for 
up to $65,000 while a used 
ship can be picked up for only 
a few hundred dollars . 

With our new knowledge of 
the sport, we were ready to 
take to the sky as fledgling 
soarers. 

The glider was made ready 
by members of the Soaring 
Club. They first unloaded the 
body and set it on the ground , 
then dismantled the wings 
from the trailer and hooked 
them into slots on the plane. 
A careful preflight inspection

The UCSD Soaring Club 

flies in conjunction with the 
Associated Glider Clubs of 
Southern California. UCSD 
owns two sail planes: the 126 
model, which has two seats 
and is used for training; and 
an antique LK-I0, which has 
room for only one ~rson and 
is used for solo flights . The 
valuable LK-1O is kept in an 
enclosed trailer to protect it 
from weather damage. Both 
planes are made by the 
Schwitzer Company, which 
Stone says makes good ships 
for clubs because the gliders 
withstand crashes well . 

was made of all the 
equipment and places of 
attachment, and when 
everything checked out, we 
pushed t he plane to one end of 
the runway and waited for 
the prop plane to deliver the 
tow line. 

BY BARBAIlA HAAS 
Sparta I!dItar 

The alarm sounded at 5:45 
in the morning, rudely 
forcing me into conscious-
ness at a time when any 
normal penon can hardly 
think. Surely there was a 
reason for my pre-dawn 
awakening; I just had to 
remember it. Soon it came to 
me . today for the first time I 
was to go soaring. 

The photographer and I 
were to meet the members of 
the Soaring Club at 6:45 (no 
later) at school to insure an 
early start on the long drive 
out to Jacumba. 

I managed, despite my 
state of stupor, to meet the 
group at only five minutes off 

the mark_ We stood freezing 
in the fog waiting for two 
members to show up, and 
when they finally appeared 
20 minutes later we were off. 

We stopped to ' get the 
gliders at the storage area 
located by Scripps Institute 
of Oceanography. The folded-
up sail plane, its two wings 
detatched and standing next 
to the body of the plane on the 
transport trailer, didn 't look 
like it would manage to 
withstand the trip to the 
desert, much less be able to 
fly . 

Debbie Stone, president of 
the Soaring Club and one of 
only a very few pilots 
nationwide, assured us that 
not only was the plane able to 

fly, but the 126 model was a 
very air· worthy ship_used for 
training new pijots. 

During the two and a half 
hour drive east to Jacumba, 
where the temperature at 9 
am is equal to the tempera-
ture here at 1 pm, Ston,e 
related the scientific and 
technical aspects of soaring. 

As I suspected, good wind 
is essential for successful 

soarin~. "The key to a long 
flight, Stone told us, "is to 
find airr that's ascending faster tnan the plane is 
descending." She then went 
on to explain how basic 
knowledge of meteorology 
helps the pilot to spot sources 
of ai r and learn where to look 
for strong currents caused by 

Gliders are available in 
different forms and corres-
ponding prices according to a 
pilot's needs and desires. 
Most everything from 
Volkswagen-like economy 
m9dels to sail planes built 
al'lng the Jines of a 
Lamborghini can be bought 

I sat in front , with an 
expert pilot in the rear sear 
manning a duplicate set of 
controls. The plane is set up 
just like the cars in high 
school drivers training: the 
practicing pilot has a full set 
of controls, but the 
eXP.f:!rienced pilot has the 
ability to take over the flight 
in case of an emergency. ~ 

The glider was attached to 
the tow plane by a 2oo-yard 
rope, and once the rudder was 
fanned to signal that we were 
ready, we were off.

Nemesis Azusa-Pacific 
defeats women spikers-

BY SAMANTHA ROBY 
Senior Staff Writer 

Simple mistakes were the 
downfall of the women's 
volleyball team, causing 
them to suffer a disappoint-
ing loss Friday night .to 
archrival and defending 
National Champions Azusa-
Pacific. The Tritons lost at 
home in the Main Gym, 15-
10,18-16,15-4. 

In Game One, UCSD shot 
off to a 4-0 lead, at which 
point the Cougars promptly 
call~ a time-out and broke 
continuity, forcing a Triton 
side-out. Azusa fought back 
to a 6-6 tie and the Tritons, 
following the course set by 
the Cougars, called a quick 
time-out and similarly forced 
an Azusa side-out. 

UCSD soon found them-
selves down 6-10 and forced 

to play catch-up volleyball . 
Their effort failed and they 
lost the first contest 10,15. 
Azusa-Pacific's skill domin-
ated the game rather than 
Triton mistakes. 

Game Two was a struggle 
that could have gone either 
way. The emotion of the 
Tritons difussed into the 
crowd, who stood steadfastly 
behind their team through-
out the evening. UCSD 
fought to a 4·3 lead, but then 
went down 7,4 on three 
success ive violations. 

UCSD and Azusa traded 
off serves for a while, theh 
Cougar All-American Debbie 
Meche got ahold of the serve 
and forged a 10-4 Azusa lead. 
With the help of Vicki Pride's 
serves, UCSD duR' out three 
more points to bring the score 
to 10-7. 

The next Triton server 
was Cheryl Wright who 
worked to an 11-10 lead with 
the help of consistent passing 
and teamwork. 
The crowd went wild. Azuxa 
promptly called a time-out 
and aftr play resumed the 
Tritons lost serve on a net 
violation. 

The Cougars stormed 
ahead to a 14-11 lead 
capitalizing on UCSD's lack 
of communication on the 
court. The Tritons regrouped 
and managed to tie the score 
at 14-14 on a service ace by 
Kim Holland and superb 
defensive combination by 
Pride and Michele Whitmore. 

Azusa didn ' t hold on to the 
baIl for long - after a Triton 
side-out UCSD's Lulu

Russel 
In Friday's Daily 

Guardian, we ran a 
picture from Theresa 
Russel's film Bad Timing 
that did not include her . . 

We were given the 
wrong picture oy the 
theater, and didn't have 
time to change. 

We compounded the 
error by forgetting to use 
a cutline (caption). 

The picture had Art 
Garfunkel, her co-star. 
We apologize for any 
confusion cause by the 
mistake. 

The San Diego Gilbert and 
Sullivan Repertory Company 
will open its 1980-81 season 
in the new Casa· del Prado 
theatre in Balboa Park. The 
Mikado, Gilbert and 
Sullivan's timeless spoof of 
bureaucrats , opens the 
season on Nov. 12 with 
performances through Nov. 
23. 

A theater spokesman said 
the move to the newly 
remodelled theater marks a 
milestone for the theatrical 
troupe. Bt'gUn six years ago 
when the renowned English 
director and actor, Martyn 

t 

Green, staged a production of 
H. M . S . Pinafore, the 
repertory company is the 
dream·come-true of Green 
and musical director Hollace 
Koman. 

Green, who was fortwenty 
years the principal comedian 
with England's famed 
D'Oyly Carte Opera Com· 
pany, staged Pinafore with a 
cast of San Diego Opera 
chorus members and choir 
members of All Soul's 
Episcopal Church on Point 
Lorna where Koman worked 
as organist-c.hoirrnaster.

Spikers lose 
a tough one 
to Azusa 

continued from paJle II 
Schwartz spiked the ball 
right back in the Courgars' 
face to force a side out. 
Whitmore then took the reins 
as server and built the score 
to 16-15 in favor of UCSD. 

Coug·ar All·American 
'Stephanie Alpenia then took 
her tum at serving and 
put the emotion-packed 
game in the bag for Azusa 18· 

l~ . ltwasanexcitipg contest 
with play concentrated at the 
net between the opposing 
front lines. 

Following the let-down of 
losing a crucial second game, 
the Tritons couldn't get it 
together for Game Three. As 
the score indicates, Azusa 
crushed UCSD partly due to 
Triton mental errors and 
simplistic violations_ 

Coach Doug D nnevik, 
who though the Tritons had a 
chance to win this contest, 
said, "They hurt us with 
their experience and 
knowledge. We're capable of 
beating these good teams 
only if we play error-free 
ball." . 

Actually, anything but 
"error-free" would have been 
an apt description of their 
game. 

The Tritons finished the 
season at second in the league 
behind Azusa-Pacific with a 
6-3 record and now look to 
qualifying for Nationals in 
the ' Regional Tournament 
that they will be hosting 
Nov. 28-29. 

The home eVEnt is the 
annual UCSD Inv~~ation next 
week-end. 

Terror 
continued from page 4 
his head. "Adios" one of his 
captors said. The trigger 
wasn't pulled. lnstead they 
dragged him back to his feet, 
shoved him in the car and 
drove him to the airport 
where they put him on a 
plane for Guatemala. 

In mid-August a darkroom 
technician from a local paper 
claimed to have been tortured 
by the National Guard and 
asked to identify pictures of 
"su bversi ve" reporters, 
including UPI bureau chief 
Demetrio Olaciregui and San 
Francisco radio reporter 
Renato Camerea. 

The consequences of such 
actions have been tw()-fold. 
On the one hand, the fear has 
sent many sources of 
information into hiding, 
drying up many non-
government streams of news. 
But on the other hand, it has 
reinforced the determination 
of most reporters here to 
resist the fear and to work all 
the harder to report the war. 

The press learned its 
lesson last summer in 
Nicaragua, following the 
death of ABC reporter Bill 
Stewart: the best response to 
repression is not to flee the 
scene, I*1t to expand .the 
cove~_

Think of a ship as a corpora· 
tion, and it's not farfetched at 
all. A destroyer may have 
fifteen officers, other ships 
even fewer. Even the most 
junior officer gets to share in 
running the show. . 

You become part of the 
management team when you 
get your commission as an 
ensign after just 16 weeks of 
leadership training at Officer 
Candidate School. 

Choose to be a Navy officer 
and you are responsible for 
people and equipment almost 
immediately, 

Many officers go on for 
further advanced schooling. 
The Navy has literally dozens 
of fields for its officers -

everything from nuclear pro~ 
pulsion to systems analysis, 
oceanography to inventory 
management. In graduate 
school, this training would 
cost you thousands, but in 
the Navy, we pay you. 

Ask your Navy representa· 
tive about officer opportuni-
ties, or mail this coupon for 
more infonnation. Or call 
toll·free 800-841-8000 (in GA 
call toll·free 800-342-5855). 
There's no obligation, and 
you'll learn about an excellent 
way to start a career in 
management. As a college 
graduate you can get manage-
ment experience itt any indus-
try_ But you'll get it sooner-
and more of it- in the Navy.

The prop plane towed us 

around the sky until we 
reached an appropriate 
altitude, The gain in speed 
was accompanied byagainin 
noise, and until the cord was 
released, freeing us from the 
motorized tow plane, it was 
difficult to understand why 
people said gliding was such a 
quietly enjoyable sport.

off the tow, everything 
settled down. Sure enough, -
we were flying in the air 
without a motor. The concept 
was mind-boggling. 

We circled in the air for 
most of the I5·minute flight. 
The trip was mostly smooth, 
although occasionally we 
passed through an air 
current that tossed the plane 
around and sent it on 
rollercoaster-like dips and 
climbs. 

We did a wing-over, an 
aerobatic trick where the 
plane somersaults over the 
tip of one wing. The pilot 
maneuvered the air current 
in concentric circles that 
became smaller as we 
approached the ground, until 
we finally landed as smoothly 
as any motorized plane. 

Once on the ground I 
wanted to go back up again, 
Up in the sky, where the air 
was cooler and the atmos· 
phere was peaceful Where 
the view was a calm 
panorama of the small town 
of Jacumba, old Highway BO, 
and the mountains and the 
desert. Where the landscape 
blended together in what 
everyone thinks of as earth 
tones, and the ground 
actually is made up of brown 
and gray and rust. But, the 
escape was over and it was 
back to bi·perl travel.

The Soa-ring Club tries to 
practice the sRort every 
weekend. About 10 members 
make up the group, but new 
members are always 
encouraged. There's a small 
entrance fee - less than $50 
- to pay for insurance and 
maintenance of the planes, 
and after the initial deposit 
members pay only for the 
flights they go on. The 
towinKplane costs anywhere 
from $8 for the tow used, to as 
much as $30 at some resort 
areas. No other equipment is 
necessary.

the Soaring Club, call Debbie
