SURF REPORT

The Jewish and pro-Israel com-
munities at UC campuses are protest-
ing recent actions taken by the UC 
Student Association, an alliance of 
UC students collaborating to provide 
a voice for the UC student body. 
After the California State Assembly’s 
decision to pass HR 35, a non-bind-
ing resolution that restricts anti-
Semitism and anti-Israel hate speech 
across state campuses, UCSA passed 
a resolution of its own condemning 
HR 35 for restricting free speech.

The Jewish community, dissat-
isfied with the methods by which 
UCSA came to its conclusions, claims 
that it was not given a voice in UCSA’s 
decision. 

“One would expect that the Jewish 
community would have been given 
the open opportunity to weigh in on 
such a resolution,” A.S. Campus-wide 
Senator Brad Segal said. “Or that 
there would have been a public, safe 
and inclusive dialogue about some-
thing as sensitive as anti-Semitism on 
UC campuses.”

According to A.S. VP External 
Affairs Olamide Noah, UCSA recog-
nizes the importance of representing 
students as fairly as possible. 

“In order to maintain each student 
agency, we [bear] the onus of protect-
ing the opportunity of all students,” 
she said. “When our non-student 
elected representatives are making 
strides to limit the right to expression 
of any group on our campuses, no 
matter their positionality in this mul-
ticulturalist setting, we stand as the 
representatives elected by our student 
bodies, whom we interact with every 
day to impede such efforts.”

But from Segal’s perspective, the 
UCSA did not succeed in represent-
ing the opinions of all students. “Very 
few Jewish students were approached 
about the resolution,” he said. “CSA 
claimed that the resolution spoke 
on behalf of ‘actual victims of anti-
Semitism,’ despite the fact that the 
passage of the resolution was a shock 
to almost every Jewish student in the 
UC system.”

minded elected UC student officials

Artists DJ Chris Cutz, XV, and The M Machine will be per-forming at the second annual 
Hullabaloo Fall Festival, hosted by 
A.S. Concerts & Events. The carni-
val will be held on Friday, Nov. 16, 
from 8 p.m. to midnight, and is free 
for undergraduate students. It will 
feature a variety of entertainment, 
games and food, as well as the newly 
released lineup of live music perfor-
mances. This year’s expected atten-
dance is 5,000 to 6,000 students, a 
significant increase from the 3,000 
students who attended last year. 

Last year, ASCE teamed up with 
members of the UCSD Founders’ 
Celebration to create Hullabaloo, 
after its predecessor, FallFest, was 
dismantled due to budget cuts. This 
year, Hullabaloo will be on the sec-
ond day of the annual Founders’ 
Celebration, and both ASCE and 
members of Founders’ Celebration 
encourage students to attend. To 
promote this partnership, Founders’ 
Celebration is hosting a “We Inspire” 
video contest; winners will receive 
$200 to The Loft, two tickets to Wiz 
Khalifa’s concert on Nov. 14, and an 
opportunity to showcase their vid-
eos at Hullabaloo.  

“Founders’ Celebration has aptly 
selected this year’s theme as ‘We 
Inspire,’” ASCE Festivals Director 
Andrea Hsueh wrote in an email. 
“Consequently, this year, our festi-

vals team has chosen the tagline, ‘We 
Eat. We Play. We Dance,’ to express 
how our students choose to celebrate 
the inspiration we derive from cam-
pus. Hullabaloo is about an entire 
experience.” 

ASCE acquired the funding to 
host Hullabaloo through under-
graduate student fees and various 
sponsorships; after reallocating 
funds within the department, ASCE 
increased its festival budget from 
last year’s $62,500 to $65,000 this 
year. 

Hullabaloo will take place at Town 
Square and Matthews Quad and 
will host a range of activity booths 
and amusement rides. The activity 
booths will be manned by student 
organizations and will feature games 
and activities such as face paint-

ing, arts and crafts, fortune telling 
and mini basketball. Organizations 
have until Friday, Oct. 26, to sub-
mit their activity booth applica-
tions.   Amusement rides include 
the “Zipper,” a Ferris wheel with 
free-flipping cars, the “Kamikaze,” a 
pendulum ride, “Human Bowling,” 
and the “Bungee Run.” Hullabaloo 
will also feature four San Diego food 
trucks: Super Q, The Dog Shack, 
Flippin’ Pizza and Devilicious. 

“The success of Hullabaloo relies 
largely upon student input, par-
ticularly when it comes to activity 
booths,” Hsueh said. “Last year, we 
were really impressed with the qual-
ity of our booths, and it was a great 
way to have students actively con-
tribute to the festival.”  

Attendees can expect a bal-

anced lineup of musical guests at 
Hullabaloo, a contrast to last year’s 
performances that centered on elec-
tronic music. Hip-hop DJ Chris Cutz 
and hip-hop rapper XV will open 
for The M Machine, an electronic 
music trio who has performed at 
both the Electric Daisy Carnival and 
the Global Dance Festival and has 
opened for Empire of the Sun, Miike 
Snow and Pretty Lights.

“My team and I have been 
working since last May to ensure 
there is something for everyone at 
Hullabaloo,” Hsueh said. “And as 
we draw nearer toward Nov. 16, I 
cannot wait to see how our efforts 
pay off.”

Geisel Library to Re-
open ‘24/5’

By aleksandra

Contributing Writer

Geisel Library will be open 24 
hours a day on weekdays, starting 
Oct. 28, due in part to a sizable dona-
tion from the Alice G. Marquis Living 
Trust. The expanded hours will begin 
with a grand opening at midnight on 
Oct. 28.

This “24/5” space known as the 
Study Commonswill be located on 
the first and second floors in Geisel 
Library’s East Wing, with seating for 
over 500 students. It will be open for 

the entire academic year. 
“Having a 24-hour study com-

mons open during the academic year 
has long been at the top of students’ 
wish lists,” University Librarian Brian 
Schottlaender said. “We also realized 
having this space open around the 
clock would help to compensate for 
the loss of other study space on cam-
pus due to previous library consolida-
tions.”

The Alice G. Marquis Living Trust, 
named for the writer and UCSD alum-
na who passed away in 2009, donat-
ed $1.1 million to Geisel, the larg-
est single donation for the library to 
date.  The contribution follows almost 
$3 million in library budget cuts in 
the previous fiscal year, which resulted 
in the closure of four major librar-
ies, including International Relations

Breast-fed Babies Have Lower Risk of  Contracting HIV

By racHel Uda 
Senior Staff Writer

UCSD immunology research-
ers, working with contributors from 
around the United States and Zambia, 
published a study Aug. 15 that sheds 
further light on the advantages of 
breast-feeding.

The study, published in the 
American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 
found a compound active in breast 
milk that protects against HIV spread-
ing from mother to infant. It was found 
that a higher concentration of the com-
pound in breast milk correlates with 
lower rates of transmission.

The compound — human milk 

oligosaccharide (HMO) — is a car-
bohydrate that, once ingested, resides 
in the infant’s intestinal tract. HMO 
is thought to help culture important 
bacteria in the intestine, and it has also 
shown anti-inflammatory properties 

that may bolster immune response.
The group initiated the study to 

determine why only 10 to 15 percent of 
infants feeding from infected mothers 
were contracting the virus.

“In developing countries, HIV-
infected mothers are faced with the 
decision of whether or not to breast-
feed their babies,” Laura Bode, assis-
tant professor in UCSD’s Department 
of Pediatrics, said. “Breast-feeding 
exposes the baby to the virus and 
increases the risk of the baby dying 
from the HIV infection, but not breast-
feeding increases the risk for the baby 
to die from other intestinal or respira-
tory infections.”

In a longitudinal study, researchers 
collected 200 samples of breast milk 
from HIV-infected mothers through-
out Lusaka, the capital city of Zambia, 
and then followed the women and 
children for 24 months.  

The researchers concluded that 
further research into HMO might be 
effective in an effort to develop a better 
defense against HIV contraction.

Council Talks Voter Registration; 
Debates New Social Justice AVP 

The Student Organized Voter Access Committee (SOVAC) came by to the A.S. Council 
meeting to advertise their Slice of 
D e m o c r a c y 
event happen-
ing Monday, the 
College Democrats 
and College 
R e p u b l i c a n s 
Debate on Nov. 
3 and Thad 
Kousser’s Political 
Party happening 
election night, Nov. 6.

The A.S. External Office distrib-
uted fortune cookies with messages 
such as “your conscience will be at 
ease once you’ve voted,” and directed 
readers to sovac.ucsd.edu, where they 
can register to vote until Monday.

AVP College Affairs Leonard 
Bobbitt gave a presentation about 
the history of his office, its purpose 
and its plans for the future. According 
to Bobbitt, the goal of the Office 
of College Affairs is to channel the 
six-college energy into a single com-
munity and a unified advocacy pow-
erhouse. Bobbitt plans to do this by 
planning a charity drive, spirit run, 
council competition, know-your-
rights campaign and overseeing first 
year council, among many other 
things.

Representatives from the leader-
ship committee for cultural celebra-
tion came by to request a bigger bud-
get. 

“As you may or may not have 
remembered, Bear Garden was last 
Friday; it was the highest-attended 
Fall Bear Garden ever,” AVP Concerts 
& Events Eric Babajanian said. He 
also reported that through a new 
contract with Insomniac Events, they 
would be giving out five passes to 
Escape Wonderland on Oct. 27. Three 
passes will be raffled to those who buy 

a ticket for the Gaslamp Killer event at 
Porter’s Pub on Halloween before Oct. 
23; the fourth will be given out via 
raffle at the Slice of Democracy event, 

and the last with 
one more raffle 
on the Facebook 
event page for 
Hullabaloo. 

W a r r e n 
Senator Hugh 
Tran reported that 
during his office 
hours he nearly 

doubled his voter registration num-
bers by getting 25 more students reg-
istered. 

Shout-out to this week’s council-
members of the week, Campus-wide 
Senator Jackie Clavin and the always-
effervescent AVP College Affairs 
Leonard Bobbitt.

Muir Senator Andrew Buselt 
introduced his plan for an AVP 
Environmental and Social Justice 
Affairs position, which caused an 
almost excruciatingly long debate 
among councilmembers.

“The argument [is] that other 
things already deal with this, so let’s 
just not, just doesn’t sit right with me,” 
said AVP Diversity Affairs Elizabeth 
Garcia. “I mean, there are already 
other organizations on campus that 
deal with diversity, so why am I here?”

The councilmembers who 
opposed the creation of this position 
were reluctant to approve the new 
office because there would have to be 
a constitutional amendment in order 
to facilitate its creation.

It ultimately passed with a 23-0-4 
vote, with most of the opposition in 
abstention. 

“This is A.S. taking a stance on 
sustainability and social justice, and 
putting it out there that this is some-
thing we really care about and that 
this is something that UCSD cares

Library Consolidation Complementing New ‘24/5’ Hours

& Pacific Studies Library and Center 
for Library & Instructional Computing 
Services or CLICS. The collections of 
each of these libraries are currently 
being consolidated into Geisel. 

The downsizing was the result of 
the $60 million total that UCSD faced 
in budget cuts in the 2011–12 school 
year. The Guardian reported in January 
on student response to CLICS closing. 

The library closures sparked the 
“Occupy CLICS” movement, involving 
approximately 50 students who 
reclaimed the library as a study center 
following its closure at the end of the 
2010–11 academic year. 

Closing CLICS saved the university 
$450,000 according to The Guardian’s 
Jan. 8 article, “CLICS to be Study Space 
After Break-in.”

Geisel had previously been open 
until midnight on weekdays, with 
24-hour access during Week 10 and 
finals. Schottlaender hopes that the 
new times will provide students who 
like to study late at night or early in 
the morning with a secure study space 
on campus. Overnight areas will be 
limited to UC students and staff, who 
will need to show identification before 
entering. 

“The 24-hour area sounds nice,” 
Emmy Young, a freshman studying 
at Geisel, said. “It seems like a good 
opportunity for us to have more space.” 

Schottlaender estimates that first 
year costs will total $200,000, with 
staffing and custodial costs at $117,000.

UC Student Association Defends its Condemnation of  HR 35 

UCSA resolution process. He wants 
to condemn not HR 35 itself, but 
the method by which it was passed. 
“I don’t think free speech should be 
limited,” he said. “But if UCSA claims 
to represent UC students, they can’t 
marginalize a large portion of the stu-
dent body and still expect to be seen 
as a credible organization.”

UCSA says its decision to con-
demn HR 35 stems what it perceives 
to be its foreseeable consequences, 
not from the contents of the resolu-
tion itself. 

The resolution “explicitly impli-
cates UC and CSU students who cri-
tique other nations as we do our own 
as fit to reprimand due to fostering 
critical dialogues,” Noah said.   “It is 
a resistance against this attack on the 
internationalism of the UC and CSU 
student.”

“No one should be limited to 

what they can or can’t say; it’s our 
first amendment right,”  UCSA presi-
dent and UCSD undergrad Raquel 
Morales said. “[UCSA is] here to 
represent the best interests of stu-
dents and they should develop their 
own ideals. We want them to come 

up with their own ideas. It’s not up 
to us to decide what’s hate speech 
and what’s criticism of foreign policy; 
we’re just here to protect their right 
to speak.”

For UCSA to reevaluate their 
position, the issue must go through 

its entire board of directors for 
reanalysis.

“It’s important for us to hear what 
the other side has to say, as we repre-
sent the best interests of students. We 
welcome any and all feedback, and 
encourage students to get engaged 
with their officers,” Morales said.

In the meantime, the Union of 
Jewish Students at UCSD is work-
ing to demand change in UCSA’s 
decision-making process. 

“We realize that some [UC] con-
stituents agree that there is a prob-
lem with HR 35 in that it goes too 
far, but at the same time, the UCSA 
process needs to be transparent,” UJS 
President Harrison Gill said. “It needs 
to go on through public meetings 
and more participation needs to be 
possible for the UCSD student body 
and the student bodies at other UCs.”

4 THe UCSd GUaRdian |  THURSdaY, OCTOBeR 18,  2012 |  www.UCSdGUaRdian.ORG

In spring 2008, thousands of high school students were rejected from their first choice universities. These students mourned, sulked and then ended up 
at different colleges. Some ended up loving their second 
choice alma maters, some transferred. And one, Abigail 
Fisher of Sugar Land, Texas, decided that she was rejected 
for being white (in truth, she was rejected because for bad 
grades) and then decided to sue. 

Since last Wednesday, the Supreme Court has been 
hearing arguments for Fisher vs. University of Texas, the 
“affirmative action” case that could completely outlaw 
race as a factor for admissions consideration within 
the UT system. While the result will not affect the 
California public universities — which cannot operate 
under affirmative action, as per 1996’s Prop. 209 — the 
ruling will alter the debate around the mission of public 
universities and the importance of diversity on college 
campuses. 

As UC Student Regent Jonathan Stein noted, the 
University of California was cited in the Supreme 
Court’s 2003 Grutter v. Bollinger case — which outlawed 
race-based quotas, but allowed race to be considered as 
part of a holistic admissions process in the interest of 
reaching a “critical mass” of campus diversity — as an 
example of a system trying to maintain racial diversity 
without affirmative action. If the Supreme Court was 
looking to the UC system for an example of the diversity 

magic bullet, Stein said, the lesson from the UC system’s 
plummeting minority enrollment rates is that there is 
no such solution. The discussion isn’t over either: As 
recently as last spring, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court tossed 
out another attempt to appeal the proposition. 

Student Regent-designate Cinthia Flores called the 
results of Prop. 209 “devastating” for diversity, and the 
numbers back her up: The number of black, Latino 
and American Indian California residents admitted to 
UC Berkeley between 1995 and 1998 dropped by 58 
percent under 209 and at UCLA, 53 percent. Judges 
who still hope for a magic bullet, take note.  In this 
instance, Fisher, who ended up attending Louisiana State 
University at Baton Rouge, maintains that attending this 
lesser school has affected her long-term success. 

“It is critical in Texas to be a UT graduate,” her lawyer 
said. “She can’t have that back.” 

This may be true, but many can argue that it is 
critical in the United States to be an Ivy League grad, to 
be white, to be male and to come from a wealthy family. 
Fisher can’t have her UT diploma and some of us will 
never have these other privileges that would make our 
lives easier. Ultimately, it is more important to level the 
playing field and maintain diversity in high education, an 
important stepping stone, than it is for Fisher — a legacy 

Editorials by major newspapers and TV journalists have often echoed the claim that the 
Republican Party is anti-science. After 
all, these are the ones who oppose 
tackling global warming and teaching 
of evolution in schools. On the other 
hand, liberals have their own share of 
anti-science quacks — most notably 
regarding genetically engineered crops 
and the false link between vaccines 
and autism.

The California Democratic Party 
recently endorsed Proposition 37, 
which requires all genetically engi-
neered foods to be labeled except 
for specific products like meat and 
dairy. While a label is typically seen 

as a warning of something wrong, 
the National Academy of Sciences, 
the World Health Organization, the 
Environmental Protection Agency, 
the Federal Drug Administration and 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture all 
agree that genetically modified crops 
are not more dangerous than organic 
ones. Yet, if this proposition passes, 
we may expect higher food prices 
once companies decide to change 
their ingredients to more expensive 
organic ones. If genetically engineered 
food is a problem, one can buy USDA 
organic or continue to shop at more 
expensive grocery stores like Whole 
Foods or Trader Joe’s.

Many prominent liberals have also 
falsely espoused a link between vac-
cines and autism. This list includes 
Robert Kennedy Jr., Jim Carey, Bill 
Maher and Jenny McCarthy. The con-
troversy stems from a paper published 
by Lancet in 1998 claiming MMR vac-
cines could cause autism. Not only has 
the paper been retracted by Lancet, 
but the lead author of the study has 
been found guilty of professional 
misconduct and can no longer prac-
tice as a doctor. This negligence has a 
high cost on society. For example, San 
Diego suffered a measles outbreak in 
2008, costing $10,736 per case. This 
could be attributed to the doubled  
rate of unvaccinated children since 
1990.

Another policy some liberals 
oppose is nuclear power. Greenpeace 
continues to vehemently oppose the 
expansion of nuclear power plants 
despite its ability to reduce carbon 
emissions compared to other energy 
choices. They overstate the risks and 
use deceitful science to explain that 
accidents like Chernobyl will be the 
norm if nuclear power becomes wide-
spread. Nevertheless, President Barack 
Obama and many Democratic politi-
cians do support nuclear power.

It may seem like I am setting 
up an equivalence where both par-
ties have an equal amount of anti-
science hacks, but the truth is that 
the Republican Party has far more of 
them. Only 36 percent of registered 
Republicans believe that global warm-
ing is mainly caused by human activi-
ties compared to 65 percent of regis-
tered Democrats. Ignorance of science 
like this has real effects on human 
lives so it is important we continue to 
scold politicians for their mishandling 
of facts for ideological purposes.

One student’s lawsuit against the University of  Texas demands the abolition of  affirmative 
action — but with diversity at stake, now is not the time to toss aside this procedure.

It’s Hard to Admit

Politics 
as Usual
saad asad
sasad@ucsd.edu

The candidates engaged in back-
and-forth accusations, called each 
other liars and even dealt with an 
apparently “major” scandal.

No, not those candidates. The 
two San Diego mayoral candidates 
— Congressman Bob Filner and San 
Diego City Councilman Carl DeMaio 
— duked it out last Saturday in the 
Price Center East Ballroom in front of 
a surprisingly small crowd of around 
75 people. Don’t let the small crowd 
fool you — the debate between the 
candidates for mayor of America’s 
eighth largest city had an unprec-
edented amount of excitement, jabs, 
name calling and what became known 
as “Coin-TossGate.”

First the latter: Though the debate 
— hosted by San Diego 6 — should 
have started at 3 p.m., the podium 
remained only half-full at 3:10. DeMaio 
informed the crowd that Filner was off-
stage arguing with organizers about the 
results of the coin toss which put the 
congressman in the highly unfortunate 

position of having to go second in the 
debate.

“Please come on out, Bob,” DeMaio 
called. “We should let the public hear 
from both of us.”

And as Filner finally ascended the 
stage, so began an hour-long volley 
of he-said-he-said. (Quite literally — 
both candidates used third person to 
describe their adversaries at various 
points throughout the debate.)

There was DeMaio’s repeated use of 
the word reform, which Filner claimed 
meant “Real Estate FOR Manchester,” 
referring to the Republican’s plans to 
allow Doug Manchester, owner of U-T 
San Diego (which recently acquired the 
North County Times) to develop prop-
erty in downtown. This led to DeMaio’s 
unsubtle and repetitive name drop-
ping of “San Diego’s top Democrat” 
Qualcomm founder, Irwin Jacobs, as a 
big supporter of the DeMaio campaign.

Best of all was Filner’s response to 
DeMaio’s voting record of rejecting 
four consecutive budgets while on City 

Council: “Carl DeMaio is the ‘King of 
No.’ No no no no no!”

While these antics are perhaps 
amusing on the surface, these men are 
vying to head the third-largest city in 
California and their debate etiquette 
is infantile at best. Based on what they 
actually said during the debate, The 
King of No and the Coin Toss Umpire 
(patent pending) didn’t differ that 
much on the real issues. In the small 
part of the debate when they actually 
mentioned visions for San Diego, both 
claimed they wanted more bike lanes, 
fixed potholes, more job opportunities 
for college graduates and to stimulate 
research and promotions for higher 
education.  Both candidates want fiscal 
responsibility, to keep the Chargers in 
San Diego and to expand the conven-
tion center downtown to attract more 
tourists to the city.

Filner and DeMaio, who both 
claim to be champions of bipartisan-
ship, did not display understanding 
of the word. No one expected them 

to endorse each other, but their sup-
posed firsthand look for students 
at real-world politics called for a 
level of maturity not on display on 
Saturday. Negative campaigning is 
something we’ve come to expect from 
politicians, but civility is a value that 
even the President and the former 
Massachusetts governor (for the most 
part) brought to their Tuesday night 
debate. Civility’s apparent absence 
from the UCSD debate is concerning, 
considering that one of the children 
(read: candidates) will soon hold the 
city’s highest position.

According to a recent ABC10 news 
poll, Filner holds a sizable, double-
digit lead over DeMaio. But that 
could change and whoever wins on 
November 6 will need to grow up a bit, 
get past the partisan politics and name 
calling, to most effectively lead San 
Diego into a future full of bike paths, 
Chargers and no more potholes.

Oh. And jobs for college graduates. 
Those too please.

ARCADE 
REVISITED  
PAgE 6



Arts & EntErtAinmEnt

W hen Rich Moore arrived at Disney in 2008, he began developing ideas for an ani-
mated film that would take him back 
to his childhood. 

“I remember playing pong at a 
pizza place growing up, and you were 
controlling something on a TV, and 
for me TVs were made for watching 
and not interacting with,” Moore told 
The Guardian in a conference call 
Sunday. “It’s been great watching the 
evolution of video games over the last 
30 to 35 years.”

While the video game industry 
was busy expanding and developing 
into the multi-billion dollar mam-
moth it is today, Moore graduated 
from California Institute of the Arts 
in 1987 and was promptly asked to 
direct some episodes for a fledgling 
animated sitcom. That animated 
sitcom was “The Simpsons.” Since, 
Moore has become a key figure in 
modern studio animation and has 
directed numerous classic episodes 
of  “Futurama,” “Drawn Together” 
and of course, “The Simpsons.”

Now, Moore has completed a 
project that Disney has been devel-
oping about video games since the 
early 2000s, the upcoming “Wreck-It 
Ralph.” The movie, in theaters Nov. 2, 
features the voices of John C. Reilly, 
Sarah Silverman, Jane Lynch and Jack 
McBrayer — an all-star cast of come-
dic talents giving these familiar char-
acters a brilliant 3-D revamp.

“It was amazing to work with 
those four, and Alan Tudyk also, who’s 
in the cast as King Candy,” Moore 
said. “You know what’s great about it 
is that I’ve been a fan of these guys for 
a long time. All of them.”

Moore was especially in awe of 
John C. Reilly, the boisterous voice 
of the film’s towering, eight-foot tall 
eponymous villain-turned-hero.                          

“John just kind of gave his all for 
this character and is so invested in 
it,” Moore said. “It’s not often that 
an actor in an animated film will say 
‘can I come over and can we talk a 
little bit more about Ralph’ or, ‘I’d 
love to meet the animators.’ John 
is so funny and every character he 
plays feels like a real human being 
with a real heart — you really care 
about his characters, and you really 

want them to achieve what they want 
and desire. Ralph is just another one 
of those classic John characters.”

In an interesting twist on the cli-
ché hero, the film introduces Ralph 
as the villain of a fictitious 8-bit 
game “Fix-it Felix Jr.,” reminiscent of 
the original “Donkey Kong” arcade 
game. Tired of being unappreciated 
and vilified by the other characters 
in his game, Ralph abandons his past 
and sets out to rename himself as 
one of the good guys.

Moore wanted the visuals of the 
film to feel authentic for gamers 

young and old, challenging the ani-
mation team to make an 8-bit land-
scape that would be captivating for 
viewers in today’s day and age. After 
Ralph escapes from the retro arcade 
throwback “Fix-It Felix,” he travels 
to an ultra-realistic shooter, “Hero’s 
Duty” and a fusion of “Mario-Kart” 
and “Candyland” called “Sugar Rush.” 
Transporting Ralph from one digital 
world to another world is the massive 
Game Central Station — resulting 
in a scene responsible for making 

A   lot has been said about Louis CK’s total disregard for con-tinuity throughout his criti-
cally acclaimed show “Louie,” which 
recently finished its third season on 

FX. At last count, “Louie” has had two 
mothers (one a sympathetic agnostic, 
the other a bitter elderly lesbian), 
a brother, two seemingly unrelated 
sisters, a white ex-wife who is rarely 
seen and a black ex-wife who shows 
up periodically throughout season 
three to expose Louie’s flaws. She is 
also the biological mother to the two 
most adorable young daughters ever 
to grace a television screen. They also 
appear to be 100 percent Caucasian.

I know that last bit sounds a little 
racist and very bizarre, but part of the 
majesty of “Louie” is watching CK 
walk up to the edge of acceptability 
and piss into the abyss. Season one of 
“Louie” started off better than 90 per-
cent of what constitutes “comedy” on 
basic cable today, but season two was 
when Louis set his sights on some-
thing even grander.

Season two — nominated for three 
Emmys, including Best Directing, 
Lead Actor, and Outstanding Writing 
(which he won) — saw Louie travel to 
Afghanistan on a USO tour, confront 
infamous joke thief Dane Cook, and 
visit an old ghost from his past who 
threatens to kill himself.

But no one said being a writer/
director/editor/producer/actor was 
easy, and sometimes the stretch 
marks showed themselves as “Louie” 
progressed through its sophomore 
season. It’s not that there were bad 
episodes in the first two seasons, but 
there were moments where you could 
see the show’s knees buckle under the 
weight of its own ambition.

Looking back on season three 
of “Louie,” a new split has opened 
between the Louis CK we know and 
love and his fictionalized counterpart. 
In real life, Louis CK has learned just 
how well his own brand of fiercely 
independent comedy works. He made 
millions when he released his latest 
stand-up special on louisck.net for 
$5 and then sold his concert tickets 
— minus service fees — through the 
same website. Seeing his success, FX 
rightfully assumed that CK would 
want a larger budget and a primetime 
slot. CK refused on the grounds that 
it would hamper his creative control 
over the show. Even in his success, 
CK has maintained the kind of artistic 
integrity that would make Metallica 
fans jealous.

But the Louie in “Louie” is some-
one who is much less certain of 
his future, and even his talent, and 
nowhere is distinction more apparent 
than in the epic three-part episode 
“Late Night,” in which Louis’s sad-
sack fictionalized Louie manages to 
“go viral” after a spur-of-the-moment 
stint on “The Tonight Show with Jay 
Leno.” The opportunity to take over 
David Letterman’s soon-to-be-empty 
seat at “The Late Show with David 
Letterman” is presented as his final 
chance at fame before he’ll be forced 
to teach comedy at a community col-
lege in order to feed his kids. (With 
that said, a “Louie”/”Community” 
crossover episode could only be the 
most amazing thing ever.)

Throughout season three, the only 
times we get close to real-life Louis 
is through the short stand-up bits, 
which have become a rarity compared 
to seasons past. But when Louie

Madea Gets Even
Funny man Tyler Perry finally becomes the 
blood-thirsty, ass-kicking rogue cop we never 
wanted to see.
By Jacey aldredge • contriButing Writer

There’s just something about Tyler Perry cascading off the side of a crumbling cement 
wall in slow motion that doesn’t mix 
well. Actually, Tyler Perry 
didn’t mix well with most 
of the things that occur in 
“Alex Cross.” Directed by 
Rob Cohen (“Dragonheart,” 
anyone?) and based on the 
detective novels written 
by James Patterson, “Alex 
Cross” has “action movie” 
written all over it. At least, that’s what 
was written all over it, until someone 
came along and scribbled in enough 
bad jokes to scare away “Saturday 
Night Live.”

Meant to represent the 12th book 
of the “Cross” saga, “Alex Cross” 
serves as an origin story for the well-
known fictional detective/psycholo-

gist/family man. The script, written by 
Marc Moss (whose only other work 
is another Alex Cross film adapta-
tion, “Along Came a Spider” starring 

Morgan Freeman) and 
Kerry Williamson (who 
has no other work), 
focuses on Cross’s stint 
on the Detroit police 
force pre-FBI days. It 
starts off like any other 
action-oriented psycho-
thriller: gunshots, 

chase scenes, scratch-free explosions, 
and a ludicrously sadistic sociopath 
serial killer played by a scarily gaunt 
Matthew Fox, who is out to get the 
rich and powerful (and a dead woman 
sans fingers).

A s a communication major (don’t laugh), you’d think I’d have fig-ured out how to communicate 
by now. But I’ll let you in on a little 
secret: Majoring in communications 

teaches you little to nothing about 
communicating in the real world. 
Sure, you learn how to get through a 
Michel Foucault piece without cry-
ing in the shower afterwards. And 
if you really pay attention you can 
even learn really abstract, outdated 
theories like the conduit metaphor. 
But what you won’t learn is how to 
communicate, at least not by today’s 
standards.

At one point in time, com-
municating was simple. It was an 
exchange of words that happened in 
person or handwriting. Due to fabu-
lous technological advances, today 
there are now hundreds of ways to 
reach someone — meaning, there 
are also about a hundred more ways 
to misinterpret someone’s message. 

As a generation we’ve made a 
pretty smooth transition from phone 
calls and love letters to texting and 
instant messaging. Getting a hand-
written love letter brings up more

I t may be mid-October, but the people of San Diego are still strolling around the streets in 
tank tops and board shorts, working 
on their suntans. No leaves chang-
ing color, no cravings for warm apple 
cider and no fireplaces. Though there 
are Halloween and Thanksgiving, it’s 
hard to experience the phase between 
summer and winter here.

That’s why there’s Julian. Located in 
the picturesque Cuyamaca Mountains, 
the historical gold-mining city of 
Julian is just a one-hour scenic drive 
northeast of San Diego. Famous for 
its award-winning apples and the fall 
foliage, along with many art shows 
and entertainment, this charming and 
historic mountain town is not to be 
missed during this time of the year.

Apple Orchards
Nothing says “autumn” quite like 

as apple picking in orchards. Picking 
apples in Julian is one of the high-
lights of the fall season.

agriculture,” said Julian Chamber of 
Commerce president Mike Meng-

match with Michael Sullivan/The 
Butcher/Picasso (Can he get any more 
nicknames?) a crazed hitman work-
ing for a paranoid French millionaire, 
complete with fetishes for charcoal 
drawings and inflicting pain. He’s also 
got a bad habit of evading capture, 
always one step ahead of our acutely 
aware detective. As Cross and his 
childhood friend and police partner 
Tommy Kane (Edward Burns) hunt 
down Picasso, he in turn decides to 
mentally torture Cross in the worst 
possible ways. After shooting down 
Cross’s pregnant wife on their anni-
versary and killing his female partner 
(Rachel Nichols), Cross becomes 
consumed with capturing Picasso. A 
battle of cat-and-mouse ensues but, 
to paraphrase Picasso, embarking on 
a journey of revenge requires digging 
two graves.

While the plot appears to be load-
ed with cheap suspense and danger, 
fear not — there’s plenty of comedic 
dialogue wedged in there for a giggle. 
And while there are indeed some 
humorous moments, especially those 
between Perry and Burns (their banter 
over who gets the “honor” of opening 
a safe with a severed thumb was cause 
for more excitement than most every-
thing else in the film), for the most 
part, the movie is full of irrelevant 
jokes awkwardly placed amongst the 
shoot-’em-up action sequences for the 
sole purpose of getting a laugh. Take a 
simple scene involving two computer 
nerds giving the cops Picasso-related 
information, which was completely 
missed because of an irrelevant Geico 
caveman joke made at the expense of 
the two actors, who were apparently 
hired only to wield large beards. 

Tyler Perry’s debut as a dramatic 
actor is more of a lackluster, if slightly 
puzzling fizzle than an absolute fail-
ure. The lumbering Perry can’t help 

but carry a certain goofy charisma on 
screen — it was as though Perry got 
lost on his way to the Medea dressing 
room and ended up on the set of “Alex 
Cross.” He fumbles, uncomfortably 
delivering lines and trying as hard as 
he can to pretend to be a tough guy. 
Perry’s not a terrible stone-faced lead-
ing man, but he’s not a very believable 
or engaging one either.

The other actors aren’t any more 
comfortable on camera. Edward 
Burns and Rachel Nichols’ relation-
ship is awkward and rushed and 
her character is disposed of before 
any real chemistry can be sparked 
between the two. Then there’s the 
super weird casting of John C. 
McGinley as the stiff police chief, a far 
cry from the snarky Dr. Cox he played 
so well on “Scrubs.” Stranger still is 
Jean Reno as the two-timing French 
damsel Leon Mercier, whose accent 
falls somewhere between Spanish and 
South Carolinian.

In the midst of all these grown 
actors being uncomfortable is the 
fragile innocence of Cross’s daugh-

ter, played by a fresh Yara Shahidi. 
Following her mother’s death, she 
steals the room with a raw under-
standing of vulnerability and pain 
far beyond her years. And then 
there’s Matthew Fox (“Lost”). Deadly, 
dangerous and ripped as hell, Fox’s 
Picasso is, if nothing else, frightening. 

In fact, the only thing more dis-
tressing than Fox’s crazy killer eyes is 
how hard they are to see amidst the 
camera’s superfluous shaking. “Alex 
Cross” gives even “Cloverfield” a run 
for its money during a pivotal fight 
scene between Cross and Picasso in a 
worn-down theater.

Consistently, the best parts of this 
film were the silent ones. The final 
moments of “Alex Cross” hit home the 
hardest — the melancholy laughter 
of two old friends, the simple action 
of Cross’s daughter playing the piano 
after screaming that she never would 
again, the shared looks of relief and 
stifled pain between mother and son. 
But be warned: Before you see this 
movie, dig three graves. You might 
want one too. 

comes out the of the other side of his 
audition unscathed (albeit without 
the job), he transforms into the Louis 
CK we know and love, who’s not 
afraid to march to the front of the Ed 
Sullivan Theater and proudly shout 
“Hey Letterman! FUCK YOU! I did 
it!” Behind the scenes, the audacity 
of the arc is shown in the sheer num-
ber of guest stars: Jerry Seinfeld, Jay 
Leno, Chris Rock, Garry Marshall, 
Paul Rudd, Susan Sarandon and even 
David Lynch all appear in one form 
or another. But in front of the camera, 
we watch the story of a man coming 

to terms with his own talent and all 
the possibilities it can bring.

With Louis and Louie on the same 
page, the possibilities are even more 
infinite than they ever were before. A 
new twitter page called “Fake Louie 
Episodes” is full of potential storylines 
that are as hilarious as they are entire-
ly possible in the upcoming fourth 
season. One suggestion reads, “Louie 
is asked to host the Oscars. Is stalked 
by a vindictive Billy Crystal. Hikes a 
mountain.” But until we get our first 
tastes of this new “Louie,” I’ll be sing-
ing that theme song all year long.

“Louie Louie/You’re gonna 
dieeeeee.”

Puzzling Cast and Concept Add “Cross”’ Chaos
▶ Cross from page 6

“Wreck-It Ralph” the Disney film 
with the most individual characters 
to date. At 190 unique characters, 
featuring cameos from video game 
favorites like Bowser, Q-Bert, Sonic 
the Hedgehog and many more. 

“I’ll be honest, 190 characters 
does not seem like that much to me,” 
Moore said. “I like ambitious stuff, 
and I like big casts and big movies. 
‘The Simpsons’ in its day was very 
ambitious and I never wanted to back 
down from a challenge, so I’m really 
proud of what we achieved.”

This confidence didn’t arrive over-
night. Moore started out in the ani-
mation business when it was at per-
haps its lowest point and the future 
for animators looked bleak, with jobs 
few and far between. But Moore’s pas-
sion and love for animation kept him 
invested in the field.

“We just kept at it, and we just 
had faith that something was going 

to happen,” Moore said. “For this to 
happen, for this dead and desolate 
business to revive, who would have 
thought it would happen… It’s all 
out there waiting for people, for 
filmmakers to come out and grab 
it and do with it what you would, 
because it’s not going to stay the 
same, it’s always changing. Whatever 
you want to do it is totally possible, 
you just have to jump in and stick 
with it because the ones that stick in 
are the ones that make it.”

Today, animation is a burgeoning 
industry, and with “Wreck-It Ralph,” 
Moore is pushing the craft to new 
heights. He’s also realized a dream he’s 
had since he was a child, busting his 
fingers under the neon glow of the 
arcade’s blinking splendor.  

“I got a talk several times from my 
parents that went, ‘you are wasting 
your time at that arcade and no good 
will come of playing video games,” 
Moore said. “I like to think I proved 
them wrong.”

distinctly hit or miss. The misses 
are a prone to clashing 
flavor combinations, 
while the hits are 
memorable, unique 
pairings that give taste 
buds a new way to 
experience classic dish-
es. It takes a chef with 
a nuanced approach to 
flavor to pair tastes and 
textures that comple-
ment each other.  

Calbi’s menu is 
scarce, featuring varia-
tions of three classics: quesadillas, 
tacos and burritos. Teriyaki chicken 
replaces chipotle, and bulgogi beef 
takes the place of carne asada steak. 
But of course cheese makes every-
thing better, so that stays.

The chicken quesadilla ($8) 
comes with teriyaki barbeque 
chicken and citrus ginger sauce 
in a thick tortilla. Unfortunately, 
the sweet, smoky flavor of the bar-
bequed chicken that Korean food is 
notorious for was lost in the cheese 
and thick tortilla. And while we’d 
invested high hopes in the sauce, it 
wasn’t any more remarkable than 
something you’d find at a Rubio’s 
salsa bar. The tacos (three for $7.50) 
fared better — less cheese and the 
addition of some spiced greens gave 
more room for the flavors of the 
respective marinades of the pork 
and chicken to come through. We 
recommend you steer clear of the 

tofu tacos. While it is a difficult 
feat, vegetarian tacos can be done 
well. But Calbi’s version is nothing 
more than some baked, bland tofu 
chopped up and tossed into soft 
taco shell.

The beef burrito ($8), however, 
absolutely stole the show. Stuffed 
with bulgogi beef, kimchi, cheese 

and greens, wrapped in 
a tortilla thick enough to 
absorb the juicy compo-
nents, it demonstrated the 
delicate pairing of flavors 
that makes fusions food 
worth the search. Korean 
bulgogi beef is subtly sweet 
and mouthwateringly ten-
der, and this time the taste 
of the beef was enhanced 
by the cheese rather than 
inhibited by it. And who-
ever thought of using kim-

chi — fermented spiced cabbage 
— as a “salsa” for the bulgogi is 
nothing short of genius; kimchi, a 
national Korean dish, is on its own 
crispy and satisfying. The spiced 
vegetable was a great contrast to 
the beef, both because of its texture 
and the spice.

Combining classic taco truck 
meals with Korean food, with its 
rich, full-bodied marinades, is a 
great way to present classic San 
Diego staples. Even the more lack-
luster dishes have potential with a 
little ingredient re-rationing. At rea-
sonable prices and generous help-
ings that compare with most other 
taco trucks and the convenience of 
its location, Calbi’s taco truck has 
just enough to offer to push it over 
to our hit list.

F or each word of ecstatic praise they’ve received over the course of their two decades 
of existence, Godspeed You! Black 
Emperor has earned exactly one 
skeptic’s eye-roll. The Canadian 
eight-piece collective is overly seri-
ous, unnecessarily mysterious and 
their music is self-described as 
being thematically political (despite 
the fact that their songs are instru-
mental). 

“Why should I surrender to this 
myth-band’s ham-fisted allusions to 
Israel?” you may rightly ask your-
self. “And doesn’t their exhausting 
band name, punctuated by an arbi-
trary exclamation point, seem to 
mock the listener for even trying?”

This conundrum is forgotten 
approximately four minutes into 
the band’s latest surprise release 
“Allelujah! Don’t Bend! Ascend!” 
On opener “Mladic,” an aviary of 
effects-pedal squawks is cast into a 
pulsating inferno of carnal drums 
and a massive, slow-mounting 
drone. When the build (which lasts 
nearly three minutes) finally peaks 
in a menacing belly dance from 

hell, it’s one of those rare moments 
that grabs you by the ankles and 
hurtles you into the abyss. It’s also a 
rare moment of clarity for the band, 
which now finds itself squarely in 
the domain of raw metal riffing. 
Gone are the eerie field record-
ings and avant-orchestration of 
Godspeed You! Black Emperor’s 
dense 2000 album “Lift Your Skinny 
Fists Like Antennas To Heaven,” 
replaced here with an urgent, hyp-
nosis-by-volume approach in the 
vein of Sleep’s stoner-metal mani-
festo “Dopesmoker.”

The second half of the album 
consists of the less menacing, 
20-minute-long “We Drift Like 
Worried Fire” (the remaining two 
tracks are shorter transitional ambi-
ance composed by the band’s core 
songwriters). Here, beautifully 
employed guitar wailing reminds us 
where latter-day post rock outfits 
like Explosions in the Sky draw 
inspiration, before the track takes a 
darker turn, vaulting into a moto-
rik jam that soars triumphantly 
through space.

In this visceral power, it’s easy to 
sympathize with the band’s desire 
to contextualize their music in the 
ultra-serious. But “Allelujah!” is as 
much about politics as it is about 
violence or struggle in general 
— and, thus, whatever subjective 
associations these conjure for the 
individual. Let it soundtrack your 
own catharsis.

S cuzzy Montreal crooner Mac DeMarco’s appropriately titled second album, “2,” is not the 
kind of album that immediately 
makes an impression on the listen-
er. In fact, if you’re not paying close 
attention, “2” can sound positively 
unoriginal — its meandering guitar 

lines and shuffling rhythm section 
are reminiscent of a multitude of 
bands who have come to promi-
nence in recent years.

The difference, however, 
between Mac DeMarco and artists 
like Beach Fossils or Teen Daze is 
that DeMarco possesses the kind 
of irreverent songwriting chops 
that allow him to create beautiful, 
carefully crafted (and above all, 
extremely catchy) melodies that 
still maintain the illusion of effort-
lessness. Highlights “My Kind of 
Woman” and “Annie” sound like 
lost classic rock anthems, while 
“Ode to Viceroy,” an homage to 
DeMarco’s preferred brand of bud-
get-priced Canadian cigarettes, uses 
its gritty, unflattering subject mat-

ter to disguise a melody that could 
be lifted off a golden-era Elton 
John album.

If “2” contains any faults, it’s 
that DeMarco’s unaffected produc-
tion style often becomes a victim 
of its own unobtrusiveness, allow-
ing DeMarco’s catchy songs to 
become almost unnoticeable under 
the blankets of yacht-rock guitar 
tones and linear rhythmic deci-
sions. However, these moments 
occur rarely, and “2” stands as an 
excellent statement, one that places 
DeMarco alongside artists like 
Grimes and TOPS in Montreal’s 
increasingly exciting art rock scene.

from stressful city lives. Many parks 
are available for picnic sites and 
campgrounds. 

“Paso Picacho is a great place 
to hike and camp,” Menghini said. 
“Not to mention the beautiful 
government park, William Heise 
County Park, that is situated along 
the northern extremity of the La-
guna Mountain Range, where each 
season brings dramatic changes.” 

Forests of oak, pine and cedar 
embrace the peaceful mountain 
meadows and offer a naturally 
peaceful setting for miles of scenic 
hiking and equestrian trails. Wild 
animals like mule deer and wild 
turkeys are often seen throughout 
the park, as are more species like 

bobcats and mountain lions. There 
are also cabins available.

Shopping
Julian transports tourists back 

through time and offers a glimpse 
of post-Civil War life. Unique tour-
ist shops on the town’s Main Street 
and B Street sell all types of craft 
goods. 

“There’s a store called Bird 
Watchers, which is one of the 
biggest businesses in town. It’s a 
bird lover’s paradise. We’re pretty 
famous for that,” Menghini said. 
The specialty shops offer a range 
of goods including handmade 
candles and knives, antiques, herbal 
wreaths and bird and clown lovers. 
What’s great about these shops is 
that they’re all within walking dis-

tances. It’s easier for people to walk 
by and feel the unique personality 
of each shop. Because Julian’s peak 
season includes the autumn apple 
harvest and the winter holidays 
(September through December), 
beware of the large crowds on the 
streets during those times of year.

questions to young people then an 
IM, even though the simple use of 
something like “ttyl” would confuse 
the hell out of the love letter genera-
tion. Only one person has ever sent 
me handwritten love letters, which 
were quite sweet, but confusing 
nonetheless. 

There’s a scene in an episode of 
“Girls” where Hannah recently finds 
out she has HPV and the guy who 
gave her the STD got it from a girl 
that often likes Hannah’s Facebook 
statuses. She complains to her friend 
Marnie, saying “It’s like, ‘Sorry I 
passed you an STD but I really enjoy 
your quirky Web presence.’” In the 
last few weeks I’ve received an odd 

amount of likes on Facebook and 
Instagram from people I’ve dated or 
hooked up with in the past. And no, 
no STDs, but like Hannah, I felt like 
their appreciation for my “quirky 
Web presence” was just as odd and 
it made me wonder what it meant, if 
anything at all. 

I fell out of touch with them 
primarily because I moved back 
to school since the summer ended 
and so there wasn’t so much as a 
phone call. But with so many new 
ways to communicate (and so many 
ways to confuse me and most other 
neurotic girls), these exes and old 
hookups have been passive aggres-
sively liking pictures of some DIY 
project in my apartment or embar-
rassing “selfies” of my roommates 

and I. I wasn’t sure what to do so I 
just disingenuously liked a photo of 
their car or band back and figured 
that was even. I don’t want to read 
too far into any of this because that’s 
the one thing a girl in this situation 
shouldn’t do. I have no interest in 
perpetuating crazy girl stereotypes. 
But in general, I’m interested in 
how dating communication has 
changed since the emergence of 
such technologies and what’s next. 
Are we really all going to go back to 
MySpace (it does actually look pret-
ty cool) and bring back those horrid 
bulletins we all posted in seventh 
grade? At least I’ll have my stellar 
communications classes to guide me 
through all this, right? Well, maybe 
not so much.

hini. “Julian is certainly a fine place 
to grow apples.” 

During September and October, 
about five apple orchards open up 
for “U-picks.” For a small fee, fam-
ily and friends can pick a variety 
of apples (and pears, at certain 
orchards) to bring back home. A 
popular venue is the Raven Hill Or-
chard, which is the largest U-pick 
apple orchard in Julian. 

Transformed into a beautiful 
shade of gold in autumn, the land-
scape is surrounded by farmland 
and rolling hills. Because Raven 
Hill Orchard is an organic orchard, 
it is not uncommon for people to 
bite into the succulent apple on the 
spot. Just look out for a worm hole 
on the apple before taking a bite.
 

Julian Apple Pies
If picking apples sounds like too 

much work, there’s an easier way to 
indulge in the nature of this quaint 
town — Julian apple pies. If there is 
one thing Julian is really famous for, 
it’s apples and apple pies. For many, 
Thanksgiving isn’t complete without 
the perfect apple pie. 

“Being so close to San Diego, 
where it’s not a very good place to 
grow deciduous fruits, Julian is an 
ideal place to be during the fall time 
with freshly baked apple pies — 
very fall-ish thing,” Menghini said. 

Be sure to stop by Julian Pie 
Company to pick up their crusty 
creations for a pre-Thanksgiving 
celebration with friends in San 
Diego or before driving back home 
for the holiday. Although Julian Pie 
Company tries to use local apples 
whenever possible, its pies are in 

such high demand that most come 
from other parts of the country. 
Different varieties of apples are 
used for different pies, so it can be 
fun to hunt for your favorite type 
of apple by trying out their various 
pies. 

Their pie variations are not only 
limited to apples — they also have 
classic pies like pecan, pumpkin, 
blueberry and peach. Frozen un-
baked pies are also sold to bake at 
home. Make sure to place an order 
early so you can pick it up yourself 
or have it shipped.

Hiking and Camping
Julian doesn’t leave out wilder-

ness explorers. As leaves turn and 
apples grow to perfection in au-
tumn, the forests are a great escape

T he annual nationwide celebra-tion of Food Day — a move-ment towards healthy, afford-
able and sustainable food that began 
in 2011 — is just around the corner. 
In honor of this campaign, UCSD 
will be hosting a sustainable food 
expo next Wednesday, 
Oct. 24 from 11 a.m. to 3 
p.m. Exhibitions by food 
movement leaders — sus-
tainable food suppliers, 
community and student 
organizations — will be 
set up throughout Price 
Center Ballroom East.

It’s an opportunity to 
meet and connect with 
those who are passionate about 
transforming the American diet and 
addressing issues about our nation’s 
food policies in relation to their 
impact on hunger, health, workers, 
animals and the environment. While 
learning about the many problems 
surrounding food, you can pick up 
a few tips on how to lead healthier, 
more eco-friendly lives. As a bonus, 
you’ll be able to enjoy free samples 
and collect resources to take home. 

Just to name a few of the suppliers 
and organizations that will be tabling, 
Fair Trade San Diego, San Diego 
Sustainable Living Institute and Ellie’s 
Garden at UCSD will be represented 
at the fair. For the excessively health-

conscious, you’ll be able to consult the 
nutritionists and dietitians who will 
also be present at the event.

Food Day, created by the Center 
for Science in the Public Interest (an 
independent science-based organi-
zation that advocates public health), 

strives to empower and 
consolidate the food 
movement. According 
to their website, they 
hope to promote safer, 
healthier diets, support 
sustainable and organic 
farms, reduce hunger, 
reform factory farms to 
protect the environment 
and support fair work-

ing conditions for food and farm 
workers. Judging by today’s increas-
ing consumption of harmfully pro-
cessed and fast-food products, this 
movement can only improve our 
food system. 

Like many throughout the nation 
who will be celebrating Food Day in 
schools, college campuses, farmers 
markets, City Halls and state capitals, 
UCSD will be no different. So come 
out, learn a thing or two about where 
your food comes from and show your 
support. As their flyer says, “It’s time 
to eat real, UCSD.”

applicant, who would have been rejected even if she were 
not white — to nurse her hurt pride. 

The University of Texas at Austin has a two-tiered 
application process. Three-quarters of its spaces are 
reserved for the top 8 percent of students from Texas 
high schools (10 percent when Fisher applied), who are 
automatically admitted. Fisher’s chances were ruined not 
by her race, but by her grades, which put her outside this 
tier and into a group that also looks at six other factors, 
including extracurricular activity, leadership potential, 
community service, legacy and, of course, race. Gregory 
Garre, lawyer for the University of Texas, notes that even 
if Fisher had achieved a perfect score on these other 
factors (i.e. if she were black), she still would not have been 
admitted because her academic performance was simply 
too poor to make up for this “personal achievement score.” 

Details of the UT system’s policy aside, it is crucial to 
uphold Grutter and at least have the flexibility of looking at 
race as a factor in holistic admission. Though other factors, 
such as income, are large components of the achievement 
gap, race affects so many other life chances — from 
stereotype threat to the fact black students are nearly 
three times less likely to be admitted to highly selective 
colleges even when controlling for income — that it is not 
outrageous to at least consider it when evaluating personal 
achievement and struggles. 

In this vein, nearly 100 briefs have been filed in the case: 
17 in support of Fisher, and 73 in support of the University 
of Texas; the supporters of the University of Texas include 
Teach for America, the American Civil Liberties Union, 
the Ivy Leagues and our very own University of California. 
These groups recognize that diversity on college campuses 
is a necessary first step to promoting opportunity and 
diversity in the work force and  ultimately, equality in the 
United States.

Dear Editor,
“Did you register to vote?” a 

female student asked me, with a 
big smile, as I walked through the 
campus.

“No,” I quickly responded as I 
smiled back. 

“Would you like to register?” 
she said. “It takes only about sev-
eral minutes. I can help you,“ she 
insisted.  

“Sorry, I’m late to class,” I half-
lied.  

She probably thought that I was 
lazy, apathetic or ignorant. But that’s 
the farthest from the truth. I wish 
I could have told her that I have 
wanted to vote ever since I turned 
18. And, I wish I could have told 
her the reason I cannot vote — I am 
undocumented.

Ever since I moved to this coun-
try from South Korea at the age of 
11, I grew up just like many other 
American students. I attended local 
public schools, learned English, 
joined sports teams and was involved 
in many different student organiza-
tions.

I eventually made my way to 
UC Berkeley after transferring from 
Laney College. In college, I studied 
political science and became increas-
ingly involved in student govern-
ment — first as the student president 
at Laney and later as a student sena-
tor at Cal.

Even after I graduate from the 
top public university with a degree in 
political science, I cannot participate 
in the voting process. I am just one 
person, but there are approximately 
2.1 million DREAM Act eligible stu-
dents who have earned or are pursu-
ing a college degree in the U.S., but 
cannot exercise the right to vote.

Some may argue that we do 
not deserve to vote because we are 
undocumented.  This may sound 
logically reasonable, but it goes far 
beyond obtaining a U.S. citizenship. 
Whether documented or undocu-
mented, there were times when 
African Americans, women and 
other underrepresented communities 
did not have the right to vote.

Even today, many people are 
having difficulty voting because of 
restricted laws to purposely prevent 
them from having the right to vote. 
For example, Tennessee voter ID law 
restricts people from participating in 
the voting process because signifi-
cant proportions of underrepresent-
ed communities do not possess gov-
ernment-issued photo identification. 
Clearly our current voting process 
is flawed. Thus, policy makers and 
elected officials should encourage as 
many people in this country to par-
ticipate in the voting process as they 
can, instead of punishing them by 
creating discriminatory laws against 
underrepresented communities. 

The November presidential 
election is just around the corner. 
Though I am unable to vote, I 
encourage others to vote in this criti-
cal election.  Voting is a basic right, 
a civic duty and a responsibility as 
citizens in this country — we should 
not take it for granted.  

You should vote because there are 
millions of undocumented immi-
grants, like me, who want to vote, 
but are unable to do so because of 
their immigration status.

You should vote because people 
fought and died for the right to vote 
in this country.  

Your vote matters, your vote 
counts, your vote can change a per-
son’s life.

“Last year as a redshirt fresh-
man, I came off the bench, and 
only played around 40 minutes a 
game,” Pozurama said. “This year 
as a starter, it’s good to know that 
I’m making more of an impact on 
the team, and assuming more of a 
leading role.”

The two wins have put UCSD, 
8-1-2 in the CCAA, eight points in 
front of second place in the CCAA 
South Division CSU Los Angeles 
and nine points in front of third 
place Cal Poly Pomona. With four 
conference matches left in regular 
season play, the Tritons have all 
but clinched a spot in the CCAA 
Championships, while in the North 
Division, the race has tightened up 
between No. 5 Sonoma State and 
No. 20 CSU Stanislaus.

“With the two wins we have 
moved up in front of CSU 

Stanislaus, but are still behind 
Sonoma State,” Pozurama said. 
“Hopefully this weekend we can go 
ahead of Sonoma too.”  

The Tritons’ next game is slated 
for next Friday at RIMAC Field. 

The match is expected to be 
one of the most anticipated con-
ference games this season, as CSU 
Stanislaus has the most dangerous 
striker in senior Karene Demery. 
Demery has scored the most goals 
in the conference with 14, and was 
named to the all-CCAA First Team 
in 2011.

“We know [CSU Stanislaus] is 
a good team,” Pozurama said. “We 
know that they have one of the best 
forwards in the CCAA. We will 
probably man-mark her to take her 
out of her game. From there we’ll 
just try and play our own game.”

SONOMA STATE INVITATIONAL RESULTS

“Yang was filling in for Marc 
Herman, and has just been a really 
solid player,” Garcia said. “He will 
definitely be traveling for us, and 
will be a big help to the team. He 
was certainly one of the reasons 
why we did so well at the invita-
tional.”

UCSD sophomore Jay Lim, the 
Tritons’ most consistent performer, 
finished second for the Tritons with 
an overall score of 215, to tie him 
for 12th place. 

Freshman Clayton Yamaguchi 
tied for 24th, along with juniors 
Lewis Simon and Jacob Williams. 

The three all finished with an over-
all score of 220, four over par.

Okasaki says the Tritons will 
look to log another strong per-
formance next weekend at the 
Monterey Bay Invitational, Oct. 
22–23.

“There should be a stronger 
field at the CSU Monterey Bay 
Invitational, and the scores are 
going to be much higher,” Okasaki 
said.   “And although it’s a harder 
course, I think that with the guys 
that we have now, we should be able 
to par even.”

UCSD to Host CCAA Cross Country Championships
By melissa martinyak
Contributing Writer

CROSS COUNTRY — UCSD is 
scheduled to host the CCAA Cross 
Country Conference Championships 
this Saturday, Oct. 20. The Triton men 
will be up against Chico State, who 
are currently ranked No. 1 in the West 
Region, along with regionally ranked 
Humboldt State, San Francisco State 
and Cal Poly Pomona. 

UCSD head coach Nate Garcia 
expects junior Kellen Levy, sopho-
more Tanner Collins and sophomore 
Scott Acton to perform well this week-
end. 

“All three have proven that they 
have the skills to lead the squad,” 
Garcia said.

On the women’s team, junior Chia 
Chang has run strong throughout the 
season. Garcia says to also look out 
for freshmen Carolina Guzman and 
Marie Diaz. The women’s team will 
be up against regionally ranked CSU 
Chico, Humboldt State, San Francisco 

State, Cal Poly Pomona, CSU Los 
Angeles and CSU Stanislaus.

The Tritons will look to match up 
with high-ranked CSU Chico. 

“We know we’ve got our work cut 
out for us, but we intend to make them 
really work for the conference battle,” 
Garcia said. “If they’re going to win, 
we’re really going to make them work 
hard for it.”

The men’s team will begin the 8K 
race on RIMAC Field at 9 a.m., and 
the women’s team will start the 6K race 
at 10 a.m. They will finish inside the 
Triton Track and Field Stadium. The 

course, which runs through the can-
yon, offers runners a challenge with 
steep inclines through the woods fol-
lowed by a final dash to the finish line.

Last year the men’s team finished 
third, and the women’s team finished 
fourth in the CCAA Championships.

“Both teams have been working 
all year and are dedicated to improve 
their standings and we’re going to 
see what we can do at the CCAA 
Championships,” Garcia said.

16 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, OCTOBER 18,  2012 |  www.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

With two back-to-back wins last weekend against CCAA South Division 
opponents, the Tritons have moved 
up 13 places to claim the No. 15 spot 
in the nation — a solid rebound after 
an overtime loss and two double 
overtime draws last weekend.

On Friday, Oct. 12, UCSD faced 
second place in the South Division, 
CSU Los Angeles. The Tritons took 
an early lead just over nine min-
utes into the match, as sophomore 
defender Michelle Yasutake slotted 
the ball to senior midfielder Jessica 
Wi. Wi — UCSD’s second top goal-
scorer — played a cross through 
to junior forward Izzy Pozurama. 
Pozurama got in front of Los Angeles 

keeper Gabriella Batmani to flick a 
header in to win the game.

“We started off the game really 
well, but I think in the second half 
the play really lagged,” Pozurama 
said. “We weren’t connecting our 
passes and finding each other. 
Luckily, our defense were able to 
hold our lead.”

On Sunday, Oct. 14, Pozurama 
scored two goals, leading UCSD to 
a 3–1 win over southern California 
rival CSU Dominguez Hills. For her 
efforts, Pozurama, who has taken a 
backseat to upperclassmen in years 
past, was named CCAA Player of 
the Week.

TRITONS BACK 
ON TRACK

MEN’S SOCCER — Expectations have 
been high for the UCSD Men’s Soccer 
team, who went into last weekend’s 
matches just one game behind top-of 
the CCAA South Division CSU Los 
Angeles.

 UCSD faced both teams last 
weekend in matches that reorganized 
the South Division hierarchy, as the 
Tritons were shut out in both games. 
UCSD picked up zero points in the 
weekend’s campaign, allowing CSU 
Dominguez Hills — formerly third 
place — to leapfrog past the Tritons 
into the second spot.

On Friday, the Tritons hosted the 
Golden Eagles, formerly the only 
team to have beaten the UCSD in 
conference play. In the rematch, CSU 
Los Angeles caught the Tritons off 
guard, as the Golden Eagles took the 
lead with just over a minute left on 
the clock. And although the Tritons 
managed to outshoot Los Angeles in 
both periods, tallying 10 shots to the 
Golden Eagles’ six, UCSD was unable 
to find the net. 

“Los Angeles was a tough game, 
we hadn’t been giving up a lot of goals, 
and we’ve been taking a lot of pride in 
that,” UCSD Head Coach Jon Pascale 
said. “We were a little stunned by giv-
ing up that goal so early, and we felt 
like we gave it away. We were a little 
shell-shocked, and CSULA is really 
good about making you pay for mis-

takes, and they certainly did that to us.”
Freshman goalkeeper Cameron 

McElfresh was only called to action 
twice in the entire match, as the 
Golden Eagles only managed two 
shots on goal.

On Sunday, the Tritons traveled 
up to CSU Dominguez Hills, facing 
the Toros for the second time this sea-
son. UCSD won a narrow 1-0 match 
against the Toros back at the end of 
September, but did not fare as well in 
the rematch, allowing the Toros an 
uncharacteristic 13 chances on goal, 
for three total goals.

“Dominguez has been the best 
team we’ve seen all year,” Pascale said. 
“They have a lot of good attacking 
players. You need a couple of breaks 
in order to get some type of result. We 
weren’t our best against them, and we 
made a couple of mistakes.” 

The 3-0 deficit is the largest margin 
the Tritons have lost by this season, 
as the UCSD backline has been one 
of the toughest to break down in the 
conference. The Tritons currently have 
the second lowest goals against aver-
age, with 0.59, just above CSU San 
Bernardino.

Conversely, UCSD’s trouble in 
front of the net proved problematic 
last weekend. The Tritons are also 
averaging the second lowest number 
of goals this season with 0.8, with CSU 
Monterey Bay trailing in last place.

Now in third place, with four con-
ference games left to play, UCSD will 
need to win their next few matches to 

climb back into playoff position.
“You’re never happy after a couple 

of losses  — obviously they weren’t 
happy after their performance,” 
Pascale said. “We just need to remind 
ourselves to take it one day at a time. 
Win, lose or draw, you’ve got to move 
on really quick. We’ve moved on and 
want to do well this weekend.

The Tritons are four points behind 
second place CSU Dominguez Hills 
and six points behind first place CSU 
Los Angeles heading into this week-
end’s matches against top of the North 
Division squads, CSU Stanislaus and 
Chico State.

UCSD is slated for two home 
matches against CSU Stanislaus on 
Friday, Oct. 19 and Chico State on Oct. 
21 for senior night. 

“The boys are excited to come 
home and protect our home turf and 
bounce back. Right now we’re kind 
of on the outside looking in,” UCSD 
Assistant Coach Eric Bucchere said. 
“We definitely have a chance to over-
take Dominguez, but we’re just trying 
to take it one game at a time and focus 
on us.”

Tritons Shut Out, Fall Out of  Playoff  Position

By rachel Uda
Sports Editor 

GOLF —The Tritons finished third 
in a field of 16 teams last Monday–
Tuesday, Oct. 14–15 at the Sonoma 
State Invitational. 
    Shooting five under par, with a 
total score of 864, UCSD was nar-
rowly ousted from second place 
by CCAA opponent Sonoma State, 
who finished with 860. Hawaii Hilo 
took the championship with a score 
of 856.

“This was definitely one of our 
better finishes, but this is more of 
what we’re expecting out of this 
squad this year,” UCSD Assistant 
Coach Keith Okasaki said. “We 
could have easily finished second, 
but made a few costly mistakes in 
the last round.”

Freshman Daniel Yang was 
UCSD’s top finisher, ending his 
first collegiate tournament with a 
final score of 213, three under par. 
Yang tied for eighth overall.
