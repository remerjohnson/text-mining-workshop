Test on.lan. 12 can now obtain. 
copy of the questions used in that 
test and a tist of the correct 
answers. 

Although sample tests have 
been available for many years, this 
is the fint time that the guestiona 
and anawers for the GRE have 
been disclosed immediately 
following a national test 
administration. 

The GRE Board, which 
sponsors the test, also released a 
40·page booklet containing the 
questions that were counted 
toward the actual scores, a list of 
correct answers, instructions for 
obtaining "raw" scores and a table 
for finding scaled scores reported 
for the tesl. The booklet also 
includes a description of the test 
and explanations of the kinds of 
questions asked. 

The booklet costs $2 per copy. 
For $3.50, examinees can also 
obtain a photocopy of their answer

Bullard, Scripps and

Sir Edward Bullard, an 
internationally known geophysicist 
and professor emeritu. here, 
IUCCUmbed to c:aneer' in his La 
JoBa home yesterday. 

He wu 72, and just this week 
completed work on nuclear waste 
disposal potities. 

bullard I·oined the Scripps 
Institution 0 Oceanography staff 
in 1963 and, in 1974 became 
aaaociated with Scripp'. Institute 
of Geophysics and Planetary 

PhI·~· 
!Juring his colorful career , 

BuUard served on the faculties of 
Cambridge Univenity and the 
Univer.ity of Toronto in Canada. 
His research specialty was the 
study of undersea plate tectonics 
and examining continental drifts. 
More recently, Bullard was 
interested in the social and political 
problem. surrounding the handling 
of nuclear reactor walle. 

A native of Norwich, E"lland, 
he was knighted in 1953 by Queen 
Etizabeth and held the Huges 
Medal of the Royal Society. 

Although he suffered from 
cancer, Bullard'. associates said 
he worked in hi. Scripps office until 
a month ago. He completed what 

they term a "major work" at his 
home this week with the help of 
an a.: .. ociate.. a Scripps 
"eawornAn laid. 

Bullard is survived bl' his wife, 
Lady Unula Margery Bullard. 

BUllard's early work at the 
Cambridge University focused on 
the application of phy.ics to the 
problem. of geology, a result of 
which was the development of a 
credible continental·drift theory. 
After the development of this 
model, the field of plate tectonic. 
was born, an area of research 
which examines the physics and 
geology of the earth's moving 
crust. 

During World War II, Bullard 
worked with the British Navy, 
developing methods for sweeping 
magnetic mines and for protecting 
ships by demagnetizing their hulls. 
Later he worked on operation 
analysi. and on the interpretation 
of intelligence material. 

After the war, Bullard returned 
to Cambridge and also joined the 
physics de~artment at the 
University of Toronto, Canada. At 
this time, Bullard's interests 
centered on an investigation of the 
earth's magnetic field and the flow 
of heat from the floor of the ocean. 

In 1950, he accepted a position 
81 the director of the National 
Physical Laboratory of Great 
Britain, which he held until 1956. 
From 1957 to 1974, when he 
retired, Bullard wu again on the 
faculty of Cambridge, at first an 
usi.tant director of research and 
later a professor of geophysics. It 
was from Cambridge that he had 
received hi. B.S. in 1929 and his 
Ph.D in 1932, both in physics, and 
hi, Sc.D in ,eophy.ics in 1948. 

For the past three years, Bullard 
had tau,... a well-attended course 
for under.,aduatea on the nature

Muir Council Will 
Survey on Salary 

BY TOBY RAYMOND 
Staff Writer 

The Muir College Council will conduct a public 
opinion poll in an attempt to deflect criticism over its 
decision to pay its chairman a salary. 

The .a1ary of $1,200 has drawn fire from the AS 
Council and Activity Fee Chairman Bill T opkis as 
"self-serving." 

Polling will be conducted next Monday, April 7, 
and Wednesday, April 9, from 12 pm to 1 pm in the 
Muir Quad. 

In order to provide students with information about 
the salary, the MCC will sponsor open forums 
coinciding with the actual polling, MCC Chairwoman 
Rosemary Grobarek says. 

Speaking against the proposal at Wednesday's 
MCC meeting, T opkis stressed the need for UCSD to 
retain voluntary student leadership as a means to a 
more effective student government. • 

Andrew Black, Muir representative on the EOP 
Advisory Committee, also opposed the proposal, 
and threatened that "Unless this (the proposal) is 
brought to a referendum, t.he entire council wiD be 
recalled." 

Grobarek says the poll is not a referendum in any 
sense and is binding on the council. • 

Currently, the MCC constitution makes no 
provision for either a referendum or the initiative 
procell. As a result, the only way for students to 
express their disapproval with the Council'. action i. 
to recall the entire Council. 

Attempts to amend those provisions will be made, 
according to Judith Green, Muir assistant dean.

How often have you sat acroaa the dinner table and 
wak:hed aa your family dumped spoonful after spoonful of

aap'iJeI" year, we are a nation of IOgar addicts. 

Sui., the high-calorie, nutrition-free carbohydrate, is the 
foc:ua of an controversy pitting nutritionists and consumer 
poupa Blfainst a food industry which utilizes over 45.5 
million of the 70 million tons of sugar produced. 

What many of us don't realize is that consumers today 
have far leu control over the amounl oflugar we eat than haa 
1lIIY other previous generation. Did you know, for example, 
that Heinz Tomato Ketchup has a greater percentage of 
...... than Seallelt ChoeoIate ke Cream (29% compared to

Ruuian Drestint is three times higher that Coca Cola (30% 
to 10'JIb)? Or that Calfee-Male is 659& sular compared to a 
Herthey Mik Chocolate bar which is 51 % lugar? 
. s.- has become our nation's number one food additive. 
The IOod industry used IUgar to retain and abtorb moisture in 
proc:eeaed food. Susar depreNel the freezing point, 
IInOOIhint out ice a-earIl and other frozen desserts. It acta as a

Not to mention the fact that, at around 1 Oc a pound, it is

How much IUpr is actually conaamed is a subject of some

recently been increasing their use of a aeconda'1' lUgar, such 
as com syru~. com sweetener, or com lUIIar. For example, 
Post Raisin Bran Iiata IUgar (sucrose) as its number three 
inaredient, corn syrup aa number five, and honey as number

Conawner groups feel that, because the industry is not now

the public is UIUIbIe to aac:ertain how much sugar it is eating. 

Sutar turns up in the strangest places. If, for instance, you

Laissez-Faire Building a 
Post-Prop. 13 Beachhead 
California Turns From Ways of Keynesian Economists 

BY THOMAS BROM 
As millionaire realtor Howard Jarvis 

marshalls his forces for a second major blow at 
California government this June, few rl'a1ize 
that the state il on the brink of secession from 
the Keynesian economic policies dominant in 
the U.S. sin~ World War II. In the process, it 
has become a crucible for new ideas that reject 
government involvement in education, housing 
and community development. 

Governor Jerry Brown, the guru of the era of 
limits, is the most visible spokesman for these 
ideas, but Howard Jarvis, the right-wing

populist; is the most effective. 
After a successful 14-year campaign to 

reduce property taxes in California, Jarvis has 
now turned to the free market theories of Nobel 
Prize-winner Milton Friedman and University 
of Southern California economist Arthur Laffer 
to tum tax slashing into a long term strategy for 

shock treatment, back-to-back cuts that would 
transfer billions of dollars ann"a1ly from the 
government to private hands. The idea is to 
return the entire process of capital 
accumulation to the private sector, rather than 
use big government as a counterweight during 
times of economic stagnation. 

Jarvis I, or Proposition 13, reduced the 
revenue of local government in California by $ 7 
billion since its passage in June, 1978. The 
measure limited property taxes to one percent 
of assellled valuation, with strict limitations on 
the ability of governments to reassess 
properties . 

Jarvis II seeks to permanently lower the 
graduated state income tax to a maximum of 
5.5 percent. Personal income taxel will be cui 
in half, lopping oH $5 billion from state 
revenues in the first year. Although 40 percent 
of the reduction will 10 to the four percent of the 
taxpayers with the hialheat incomes, Jarvis II, 
like its predecessor, is being sold successfully al 
a defense of the little guy_ 

"We're not going to permit the people to go 
broke while the government gets rich," Jarvil 
told the National Press Club in Washington.

Iran, Unsure of 
Carter, Delays Action 

Iran's Revolutionary 
Council yesterday demanded 
clarification of US pledges 
before asking militants to hand 
over the American hostages in 
Tehran. President Abolhas· 
san Bani-Sadr was quoted as 
aaying AyatoUah RuhoIlah 
Khomeini would have the final 
decision on a transfer of the 
captives to government 
control. 

Foreign Minister Sadegh 
Ghotbzadeh told reporters 
after a council meeting last 
night that Iran wanted 
President Carter to clarify 
commitments of restraint 
made in response to conditions 
set by Bani·Sadr. 

Bani-Sadr said in a speech 
Tuesday he would seek 
custody of the hostages if 
Carter promised to refrain 
from " propaganda " or 
"provocation." The Carter 
administration responded with 
a pledge of restraint. 

However, Ghotbzadeh 
said, "We have to have some 

more information on the 
precise position of th~ United 
States concerning the 
statements which were made 
by Mr_ Bani-Sadr." 

Asked when the response 
could come, he said: " I hope 
,within a couple of days . .. He 
said the council might formally 
request custody on Sunday. 

Before the council delay, 
Moslem militants holding 50 
Americans inside the US 
Embassy made ambiguous 
statements concerning their 
willingness to relinquish 
cUitody of the hostages to the 
government. They spent their 
152nd day as captives

five yean until UlllUccellfuly running ror Congreu 
in 1970. Hit po&tical apprenticeship wu Io"ed at 
the side of lOciai justice champion Allard 
Lowenstein, Hart'. dole friend. 

Hart milled the lint two budget hearing. because 
he wu a pallbearar at Lowenatein'. funeral in New 
York in March, but he never oHered that or any other 
excuse for his absence. 

Hi. non-violent, anti-war activities, which included 
turning in hi. own draft card in protest of the Vietnam 
War, curried favor with stuclenll in the late' 1960s, 
yet because he Wall viewed a. an upstart by the 
wealthy c!)n.ervative e.tabli.hment of Santa 
Barbara, he wu not ·able to unseat the iocuntbent 

Repu~ican Auemblran. who was "the dumbe.t 
California Ieplalor acconing to a Califomia 
Joumolsurvey. 

In 1974, with help from the mo.t .ubetantial 
campaign organization ever mounted at UCSB (with 
the exception of the McGovern campaign), Hart 
carried 90 percent of the vole. 

Hart cIeniea, however, that he hu any political 
debts to 1IudentI. 

"I tend to side with stuclenll because I happen to 
.... with tt.m on moet items. bull certainly haven't 
IIIIJ'1Ied with them on all thing •• " 

Lut year, Hart voted in favor of instituting a 
$1,000 tuition for medicaillucienll, • propoeaIlater 
killed in an AuembIy.Senate conference committee. 

"Maybe all of us in politics would like to think we 
are immune from political prellures ... that we are 
statesmen and not groveling politicians. 

In the face of Propo.ition 9 cull, Hart'. previously 
solid .tand against tuition iI waxing thin. He doe. 
maintain, though, that placing two-thirds of the 
burden of any cull on Ibldertll, the UC 
admini.tration'. plan, ia unfair. 

"It seem. to me the burden .hould be more equally 
.hared. Whether that'. 50 percent or 25 percent or 
lOme lesser figure I'm not prepared to .ay," Hart 
say •. 

"But I don't like to talk about the cull that are 
,om, to come because it i. like a self-fulfilling 

, prophecy, and my primary focus i. still trying to lee 
that Propoaition 9 iI defeated, and I think it can be 
defeated." 

While not praising UC President David Saxon'. 
recent letter on tuition, he did lUlJge.t "you could 
make a case, I guess, that he'. trying to gel ~Ie 
concerned and involved. I like that allpect of it.' 

Hart has allO .hifted his .tand with regard to UC 
management of the nuclear labe at Livermore and 
Loe Alamos, N.M. 

"I have • difficult time under.tanding how that role 
ia really consiltent with a free and open institution. 
I've felt in the palt that the university it responding to

The unit was to have

and is proceeding up the coast 
to Wa.hington. 

The team is approximately 
one·third of the way through 
their seven race sealOn. In 
both 1978 ana 1979 they 
were second in the Western

What They Lack In Height ... 
When this sea.on's 5·10 and under Men's 

1M basketball began, nobody knew what 
brand of basketball to expect. Would aerial 
exhibitions dominate play, with dunks. blocked 
shots and countless goaltending calls being the 
norm? Would Mike Hipp and Scott 8ernedes 
have to lose sleep over the possibility of a 
shattered backboard? 

The play above the rim never materialized 
as teams utilized the runnin' and gunnin' band 
of basketball which has made UNLV famous. 
There were two teams who captivated the 
spotlight from the opening tipoff and they 
found themselvef squared off for the title 
game. 

Popcorn was undefeated in ' league play 
while Magical Press only suffered one defeat, 
which was at the hands of Popcom 52·46. But 
the script for the finals had a different ending as 

the Press squeezed by Popcorn 43-41 to claim 
the divisional title. 

Popcorn looked like they were going to hokI 
onto their status .. the favorite when they 
controlled play and went into halftime leading 
19-17. 

But the second half had a different AavO{ to 
it as Magical Press' Kamal Ra.heed led their 
offensive attack. Rasheed led all scoren with 
19 points. Johnny Limm added eight poinll for 
the winners. 

The difference came at the charity stripe all 
the Magical Press dropped in nine free throws 
and Popcorn only cashed in on three. 

The rest of Magical Pres. is Mulazim 
Washington, Gary McKinnon and Mike 
Martin. Washington and McKinnon tallied 6 
points in the finale while Martin added four.

Puckers Grab Title 
1M's Stanley Cup Close, But 
Sons of Scarafoni Edged 5-4

The Mother Puckers finally 
proved, without a doubt, that 
they are the beat team in AAA 
1M floor hockey when they 
defeated the Son. of Scarafoni 
5·4 to capture UCSD'a 
Stanley C.up. 

The Mother Puckers 
jumped out in front on a Jon 
Gold wri.t ahot which 
handcuffed the SOS goalie. 
Chri. Liotta, 50S center, tied 
the score ju.t before the end of 
the 6rst period. 

The Sona put on the 
preaaure in hopei of grabbing 
the lead early in the aecond 
period only to see Andy 

Lockhard and Jon Gold 
acored on breakaway., Chris 
Liotta netted his second goal 
for the Sons but his one man 
show turned out to be not 
enough, 

The Mother Puckers added 
two more goals before Liotta 
scored his third and fourth 
goal. Mother Pucker captain 
Ben Sweet and AI Jackman 
gave solid performance. as the 
Mother Puckera grudgingly 
held onto their one goal 
advantage when time ran out.

Doubleheader Lost 
to Separate Teams 

Tritons Shuffled Aside: 6-0, 10-5 
The UCSD baseball team found a scheduling oddity little to their 
liking when they dropped both ends of a doubleheader yesterday 
afternoon. The strange part of the story is that the defeats carne 
at the hands of two different team •. 

The first game saw the T rilona drop a 6·0 deciaion to Grand 
Canyon College. Southpaw Bert Homan auffered the loll aa the 
UCSD offense waa all but atifled. Second baseman Dean 
Scarafoni, who hit the ball hard both times up, collected the 
Triton', only two hits , 

The second conte.t wu do.er, but the outcome was the 
same", the Tritons were handed their 14th 1011 of the seaaon 
when they came up on the short end of a 10-5 thrashing by Cal 
Lutheran. CLC had already trounced the T ritona in a 
doubleheader earlier thia season. 

I 

The Tritons won't have long to lick their wounds as they muat 
look ahead to the doubleheader for this Saturday at Olaen Field 
against a tough United Statea International University squad. 
Senior Tom Nicholson will be the probable starting pitcher in the 
opener, while Freshman Paul Schmuck will toss the nightcap,

The clouds had cleared, but 
the fair weather was no help to 
the UCSD Women's Tennis 
team last Wednesday. The 
Tritons were trounced by 
Grand Can~on College, 9·0, 

Robin Davis, still the 
substituting number one seed 
for the injured Cecilia 
Kavanaugh, was defeated 6-
0 , 6-0 by GCC's Liz Armas. 
Davis seemed to be troubled 
by her lack of concentration. 
She double·faulted several 
serves and had difficulty lifting 
her backhand over the tape. 

Armas came back with 
spinning backhands and well· 
placed cross· court shots tht 
Davis couldn't answer. Davis' 
muffled cries of "Oh, Robin, 
you can't do that ," after a poor 
shot were too common. 

Coach Liz Dudash felt that 
the team just waan'l psyched 
up for this match, 

"E veryone 's looking

Stills Concert Sad: Past His PriDle 
BY MIKE ntOMAS 

Steve Still. hal had a 
checkered career, to put it 
mildly. At the beginning of the 
70.. he was widely touted as 
the American Paul McCart-
ney (in 1970 that wu .till a 
compliment). He played bass, 

Him, Playing In SOD-Seat USD Auditorium? words, he could be counted on to release an album half 
stocked with acceptable 
material, combined with a 
aide', worth of complete drek. 
After five yean of thi. grand 
larceny , he was finally 
drummed back into line on the 
Crosby, Stills and Na.h 
reunion Ip, but hopei for an 
artistic renaiuance were short-

~ved with the reIeaae of hi. 
dreadful "Thoroqhfare Gap" 
album last year and the 
notoriou •• " Can't Get No 
Booty" disco 45. 

piano, organ and percusaion 
u well u lead guitar for 
Crosby , Stilla. Nash and 
Young and was the founder of 
one of the legendary band" of 

the Sixties , the Buffalo 
Springfield. His first solo 45 , 
"Love the One You're With" 
was a worldwide smash; with 
his blonde surfer good looks, 

the world was hi. for a song. 
But the trouble wal, Stills 
never wrote that lOng. After 
compoaing some of the finest 
and most memorable songs of 
the Sixties, he failed to make 
the transit ion into the 
Seventies with much grace.

His first album wa, good, 
though gloll)' and somewhat 
superficial, but his second 
album revealed an enormous 
infatuation with his own self· 
importance. "Will I ling my 
last symphony to an empty 
room? " indeed. Rumors 
began circulation of Stills 
being the biggest coke ,norter 
in aU rockdom (no amall 
accompli.hment;) he was 
actually found crawling on the 
floor, out of hi. mind, in a La 
Jolla hotel hallway; which 
relulted in a bust for him in '71 
and a $1,000 fine. 

But in '72 he confounded 
skeptics with his biggelt 1010 
triumph, the first "Manauaa" 
album. A double record:.. he 
teamed with former Byrd/tsur-
rito Brother Chris Hifiman, to 
create a Country and Western 
" Layla" . Yet unfortunately it 
wu to be his last hurrah for 
five years. He decided ~ to 
concentrate on becoming a 
guitar virtuOlo, and he pn~ved 
the truth of the old saying that 
when a songwriter die, he 
becomes a technician. Stills 
became a prime offender of 
what aeema to be the bane of 
the Seventies in rock music.

bring. us to what Get Happy!! 
really i.: neither a muterpiece 
nor a landmark to be 
p-ematurely canonized, but 
instead a firm confirmation of 
the major talent hil audience 
IUSJ!«ted he poueaaed. 

The major revelation on Get 

Happy!! is that COItello, like 
many had hoped, has 
transcended the slight 
trappings of new wave and has 
become a IOngwriter, an artist 

with a firm grasp on hi. 
material who can write lOngs 
Uling an encyclopedic array of 
long Ityles to their full 
meuure. 1be 20 song. on Get 
Happy!! comprise, for the 
mo.t part, IOmething of a 
short order course in pop 

pointed out, is harely a new 
wave dilettante who 
plagiarizes other people's art 
becaule he's unable to develop 
his own voice. Rather, 
Costello shares methodologi· 
cal affinities with the patron 
aaint of the Frenclt New Wave 
film school, Jean Luc·Godard. 

Godard, who through his 
young life had been .urfeited 
with American genre films by 
John Ford, Howard Hawks, 
Nicholas Ray, Sam Fuller and 
other HoUywood director., 
took to making his own 6lms 
during the late GOa, using 
many of the same camera 
styli sties of his American 
influence.. Godard, aware 
that he was a French 
intellectual first and that he 
couldn't make "American" 
films no matter how much he 
admired the visual graceful· 
nell American director!! 
occa.ionaUy managed, ended 
up subverting the genres, 
inlerting heavy doses of 
philosophy, Marxist literary 
criticism, semiological 
dissertations on language, and 
other notion. stemming from 
the French proclivity for 
spinning theories, concepts 
that Godard's American film 
inOuences would doubtlessly 
• tand gap-mouth at. Film 
genres to Godard, then, were a 
medium he could use, alter, reo 
tool, change, subvert. 

Costello is a songwriter of 
courle, and one wouldn't 
belabor a comparilOn between 

him and Goddard beyond a 
simple point: like Godard, 
Costello ahufOes music styles 
and makes use of them the 
way he wants. He does this 
through his lyrics, which along 
with Steely Dan'. are the mo.t 
disturbing, dense and difficult 
in rock. Often times, Costello 
enjoys writing a lyric with no 
literal meaning against a 
melody that evokes IOmething 
eI.e entirely. In "Secondary 
Modern," with a soft croon 
over a melody that could ~s 
for some of the blander efforts 
~f JacklOn Browne, Costello 
sings: "This mUlt be the plac;;e/ 
Second place in the human 
race/ Down in the balement/ 
Now I know what he meant/ 
Secondary modern! Won't be 
a problem/ Til the girls go 
home ... " The melody, as 
pleasing as anything else could 
be, says one thing, but the 
lyrics, full of sparse detaill and 
indirect innuendo, deny that 
pleasure. Costello'l aim seems 
to .be to set us up in the visceral 
plane, and then to pull the rug 
out from under ua once th~ 
worda sink in. Dangerous 
activity. 

Lack of space makes it 
impossible to go into a lOng· 
by'lOng account, but here are

gospel vein, i. abstracted

Continued from page 11 
mighty have fallen!). 
Throughout the interview ) 
continually lenled a 
bitterness, particularly 
directed at former companion, 
Neil Young. Manr, have taken 
Young's album, 'Ruat Never 
Sleep." as a dig at Stills, with 
tines like "better to burn out it 
il than to rust" and "10 I got 
bored and left them there, they 
were juat dead weight to me." 
It's as if StiDs felt betrayed by 
Neil; when I said they had 
been, at one time the 
American Lennon and 
McCartney, Stills readily 
agreed, only to attack Young 
for fouling up that plan. ) had 
'originally come to ask lOme 
questions about his fall from 
grace but once I met him ) 
simply couldn't. It was too 
aware of what's gone wrong in 
his career, he's got his demons 
to live with, 10 instead,) settled 
for a history lesson from the 
man who was almost a 
Monke. 

'History Lesson' Seems Bitter Toward Neil Young to me. G: You played ba.. and 
organ and guitar. 

Daily Guardian: Is it true 
that the Springfield recorded 
an album called "Stampede" 

that was never released? 
Steve Stilll: It's true. Some 

of the music got used on 
"Crosby, Stills, & Nash" and 
some went here and there, but 
yeah it's .true. I've lost track of 
the tapes. I think that Neil 
grabbed most of them. 
G: He finally came out with 
"Down to the Wire" (the 
"Decade" Ip). 

S: Yeah, we were really 
Ketting into production then. 
We did a lot of our most 
inventive .tuff. 

G: I've got a bootleg of you 
singing "Down to the Wire". 

S: Yeah, I did that one night 
cause I wanted ... Neil 
was ... see, Charlie Green (of 
Green·Stone, their managers) 
they really dug Neil but in a 
moment of ... lOmething ... they 
told him he didn't sing that well 
10 he got really paranoid about 
it and consequently he didn't 
sing with the kind of authority 
he needed, and ) wall basically 
trying to show him some of the 

phras~gs that could be done 

Pollical Film 

on it. And of course he took it 
all wrong and got weird about 
it, but that was the intent of 
that. 

G: ) want to congratulate 
you on what I think il the 
American "Sgt. Pepper"-
"Buffalo Springfield Again". I 
know you guys were under a 
hell of a lot 01 pressure and to 
tum out an album like that is 
incredible. 

S: Yeah, it was far out. It 
was OK, I like that one. There 
was one song I let Richie sing 
that I wish I'd sung myself. 

G: "Hung Upside Down"? 
S: Absolutely. 

G: I remember an interview 
where you said the guitar. on 
that song sounded like 
saxophones. I like that, it was 
true. 

S: Yeah, we discovered a lot 
of things then, but consequent· 
Iy we lost one thing on the

It is with deep pride and a continuing sense of 1088 that we dedicate the Spring, 1980 
Political Film Serle! to our depaned teacher and campanero, Joseph Sommers, on 
the Ant anniversary of his death. Professor of Latin American Literature and 
Chairman of the Department, Joe Sommers w .. a great student and proponent of 
Chicano Literature and a drele&l Athter for the riKhts of the oppressed - from hil 
early days u a labor orpnizer and his appearance "before the McCarthy panels to his 
.tfUIIIla on behalf of F.mworken, Chilean refugees and progreaive Latin 
American intelle<:tuals. His life wu a life devoted to the idals for which we still 

atruale, inspired and strenathened by his example.

live ... which we didn't get in the 
studio for the most part. Live, 
we were a. bad as the RoDing 
Stone., B·A.D, and we never 
did get that in the .tudio. We 
discovered that right away 
when we went into the studio 
the first time. We went WOW 
what was that, that'. awful. 

S: Yeah and they were 
really surprised 'cause they 
had only heard the IOngI in 
reheanal. with acouatic 
guitarl and had no idea what it 
would be. 

- G: Like the or,an on 
"Marrakesh Express' . 

G: Yeah, that fir.t 8Jbum 
BOUnds 10 flat. 

S: Yeah, and they dut it. 
Then Neil joined and it was 
CSNY, but he didn't ... uh ... 
there was a whole number 
about that. It got back into the 
same damn war we were iIdo 
in the Springfield. It wu really 
ItUpid and by that time J'd 
grown oot of all the chanaes 
we'd ~one throuah in iLe 
Springfield and ) dian't want to 
hear about it and I'd just get 
really irritated. 

S: Yeah, we didn't know 
what to do but Neil and I made 
it our busine .. to find out and 
the engineers helped us. 

G: Jim Melsina? 
S: No, Bruce 8otnik, firlt. 

G: Was it musicaJ? 

He helped me a great deal. 
And that evolved into what I 
did with Crolby, Still. and 
Nash. That education I took 
into CSN. Graham and David 
hadn't paid that much 
attention to their own 
production. Graham was great 
about telling me when the 
arrangement was going too far 
but pretty much they left that 

S: Yeah, well it wu not 
wanting to be told what to do 
and not accepting any 
criticism or any suggestion 
with any kind of grace and not 
being a pro about it.
