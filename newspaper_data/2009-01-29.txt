Freshmen Apply in Record Numbers; Campus Rate Drops

By Omair Qazi
Staff Writer

The University of California 
received a record number of enroll-
ment applications for fall 2009, but 
saw a significant decrease in appli-
cation growth compared to previous 

years. UCSD incurred a 0.7 percent 
decrease in applicants for the class 
of 2013 compared to the number of 
applications received last year. 

UC spokesman Ricardo Vazquez 
said the drop in enrollment growth 
is a result of a smaller high-school 
graduating class. 

“We are still seeing continued 
growth despite the decrease in [high- 
school] graduates and that indicates 
that there is a strong demand among 
California students for a UC educa-
tion,” Vazquez said. 

The UC department of finance has 
projected incremental decreases in the 

number of graduating public high-
school seniors over the next few years 
before the application rate stabilizes. 
According to Vazquez, demographic 
shifts like these are not uncommon in 
the UC system’s history.

UCLA secured the highest num-
ber of applications, followed by UC 
Berkeley and UCSD. UC Merced and 
UC Riverside received the fewest 
applicants. 

According to Assistant Vice 
Chancellor of Admissions Mae W. 
Brown, out of 47,032 applicants, 

Regents’ decision to cut 
enrollment by over 2,000 
will result in fewer offers 
from top campuses, 
more from Merced.

IRVINE LEADS 
FIRST STEM-
CELL STUDY 
ON HUMANS

By David Harvey
Senior Staff Writer

Using research and methodol-
ogy developed by UC Irvine’s Hans 
Keirstead, California-based stem-cell 
research company Geron will be the 
world’s first to conduct clinical trials 
on people using human embryonic 
stem cells following federal govern-
ment approval earlier this month in 
a procedure that will attempt to treat 
acute spinal-cord injuries.

Keirstead gained international 
attention in 2006 when his lab pub-
lished results showing the successful 
use of stem cells to repair damage in 
the cellular sheath protecting spinal 
nerves in mice. The procedure induc-
es stem cells — capable of transform-
ing into any cell type — to become 
those that reconstruct the sheath pro-
tecting spinal nerves. Without this 
protective coating, electrical impulses 
fail to complete their path, leaving 
victims paralyzed below their injury.

Less than a dozen paralyzed 
subjects will participate in Geron’s 
nationwide trials, receiving treatment  
seven to 14 days after injury, the peri-
od deemed suitable for the procedure, 
according to Keirstead’s studies. 

Evan Snyder, a professor at the 
Burnham Institute for Medical 
Research, said in an online forum that 
this trial will monitor several possible 
side effects, such as the emergence of 
cell types inappropriate to the ner-
vous system like muscle or bone cells, 
the overgrowth of transplanted cells 
causing tumors and compression of 
nerve fibers that could instead inhibit 
function in patients.

“Until there is some data from 
this study it won’t have much impact 
on current research,” said Larry 
Goldstein, director of stem-cell 
research at UCSD. “We won’t know 
for some time. ... It is a shot in the 
arm for the field but this is still a 
phase-one trial.”

After Months at the Bullhorn, Workers Secure Wage Hike

By Jesse Alm
Associate News Editor

The University of California 
reached a tentative contract settle-
ment with the American Federation 
of State, County and Municipal 
Employees Wednesday morning, 
closing a 15-month bargaining peri-
od for its 8,500 service workers.

Since October 2007, the custodi-
ans, gardeners, food-service workers 
and bus drivers have picketed, lob-
bied and gone on strike statewide 
to decry UC executive salaries and 
demand a living wage.

“After a year and half of nego-
tiations, this is truly a historic day,” 
said Lakesha Harrison, president of 
AFSCME Local 3299. “[Our actions] 
were key to getting UC executives to 
do the right thing and readjust their 
priorities from executives to the low-
est-paid workers at UC.”

The five-year contract includes 
annual, across-the-board raises of 3 
percent — paid retroactively through 
October 2008 — as well as an addi-
tional 1 percent bonus effective in 
July of this year. All service workers 
will reach a statewide minimum wage 

of $14 per hour by January 2013, 
up from the current minimum of 
$10.28, and a series of category-spe-
cific increases will reward employees 
for their experience.

In addition, contract language 

prevents the university from modify-
ing health care and retirement ben-
efits without union approval.

Shelley Nielsen, the university’s 
chief negotiator for the contract, said 
she is proud that service workers will 

finally receive the compensation they 
deserve. 

“We are very pleased to have 
reached what we believe is a fair agree-

UCSD Senior Pioneers Domestic-Partnership Initiative
By Vanessa Do
Senior Staff Writer

Voter approval of Proposition 
8 last November — which ended 
same-sex marriage in California — 
inspired one UCSD student to create 
the Domestic-Partnership Initiative, 
a project aimed at finding a compro-
mise between the debate’s pro and 
con camps. 

Founded by John Muir College 
senior Ali Shams, the initiative 
calls for the word “marriage” to be 
removed from California law and 
replaced with “domestic partner-
ship,” repealing Proposition 8 and 

giving legal equality to all couples 
regardless of sexual orientation. 

The California constitution cur-
rently states that “only marriage 
between a man and a woman is 
valid and recognized in California.” 
According to Shams, the initiative’s 
goal is to take “marriage” out of the 
constitution entirely, rendering it a 
social ceremony rather than a politi-
cal institution. 

Shams hopes this compromise 
can resolve the Proposition 8 dispute 
without offending those opposed to 
gay marriage for religious reasons. 

“I grew up with a different ethnic-
ity and people would discriminate 

for being a minority,” Shams said. 
“But this is California, we’re sup-
posed to be liberal. It’s not fair for 
people to get married, and then to 
have their rights removed. I also real-
ize that the religious community may 
not follow these things and it’s hard 
to persuade them to look past their 
religious beliefs, so a compromise is 
necessary.”

California Institute of the Arts 
student Kaelan Housewright is work-
ing alongside Shams.

“By making marriage a social 
institution, we will create equal-
ity for both men and women within 
the state, regardless of their sex-

ual orientation,” Housewright 
said. “Furthermore, the Domestic 
Partnership Initiative upholds the 
belief of separation of church and 
state put forth by Thomas Jefferson 
and the First Amendment of our 
Constitution.”

Housewright and Shams submit-
ted the initiative to the state attorney 
general’s office last week, where it 
now awaits fiscal analysis and the 
official title and summary that would 
appear on the petition. 

Shams hopes to receive the title 
and summary on March 9, and will

In the past 15 months, students, faculty, staff and community members have repeatedly gathered on Library Walk to support wage increases for the university’s 
8,500 service workers. Their efforts have been part of a statewide movement marked by boycotts, sit-ins, letter writing and a five-day strike.

SUNNY SIDE UP

STEVE AND LUCKY

 BY PHILIP RHIE

 BY BEN HOLM

The Alumni Association has 
named five UCSD graduates to be 
honored at its 31st Annual Awards 
for Excellence event, on Saturday, 
June 6.  

The honorees include Donald W. 
Murphy, the National Underground 
Railroad Freedom Center’s chief 
executive officer; Abbie Celniker, a 
renowned molecular biologist; Jeffrey 
Rabin, UCSD professor of math-
ematics and former co-director of 
the Algebraic Thinking Institute; Gary 
Curtis, a biomedical entrepreneur; 
and Wayne Kennedy, UCSD’s former 
vice chancellor of administration and 
the UC Office of the President’s for-
mer senior vice president of business 
and finance.

Ticket sales for the event, which 
is open to alumni and the general 
public, will raise funds for the alumni 
association’s endowed scholarship 
programs.  

The UCSD alumni award recipi-
ents will join other accomplished 
individuals who have received the 
award, such as Roger Revelle.

Alumni Association to 
Honor Award Recipients

CURRENTS
UCSD expects to enroll a freshman 
class of 3,775. 

Overall, UC applicants had a 
mean GPA of 3.67 with an average 
SAT score of 1,726 and an average 
ACT score of 25. UCSD applicants 
had a mean GPA of 3.77, while those 
applying to UCLA and UC Berkeley 
held, on average, 3.79 and 3.84 GPAs 
respectively. 

“The quality of the UC freshman 
applicant pool remains high, and 
this year’s outcomes are generally 
consistent with the last two cycles,” 
Vazquez said.

Despite the decrease in freshman 
applicants, transfer applications to 
the UC system increased by 13 per-
cent, and by 17 percent to UCSD 
specifically. 

At the advisement of UC President 
Mark G. Yudof, the Board of Regents 
voted this month to cut 2009-10 
freshman enrollment by 2,300 stu-
dents due to a lack of state funding. 
However, at the same meeting, the 
regents also increased the number of 
systemwide transfer enrollments by 
500 students. 

“[Transfer enrollment] is very 

important to us,” Vazquez said. “It’s 
a path that is important to be kept 
open, especially since it is cost-effec-
tive for many students in these eco-
nomic times.”

UCSD plans to adhere to Yudof ’s 
request to reduce freshman enroll-
ment targets. 

“We are overenrolled at the fresh-
man level and are trying to bring our 
enrollment in greater alignment with 
the funding provided by the state so 
the reduction at the freshman level is 
appropriate,” Brown said.

Despite a lack of funding, Brown 
said UCSD will ensure that “we 
continue to offer quality academic 
programs for those students that 
accept our offer of admission.” She 
said there are diverse programs for 
those entering at either the freshman 
or transfer level, and the university 
makes no recommendation regard-
ing which path a student should 
choose to enter the university. 

Despite the curtailment of fresh-
man enrollment, the university will 
still offer placement at a UC campus 
to every eligible California resident 
who applied. According to Vazquez, 
students who are eligible and are not 

admitted by any of their preferred 
campuses will be referred to UC 
Riverside or UC Merced. 

Despite slow application growth 
overall, ethnic and racial minori-
ties increased their presence in the 
application pool this year. American 
Indians showed the largest rise, with 
an 18.9 percent increase in applica-
tions compared to last year. Latino 
applicants rose by 9 percent, while 
black applicants rose by 5.8 per-
cent and Asian American applicants 
increased by 4.8 percent. 

“We are very pleased with the 
healthy jump in applications from 
African American and Chicano/
Latino [groups], particularly at the 
transfer level,” Vazquez said.

According to university offi-
cials, with enrollment caps and the 
increase in freshman applications 
this year, admission will be more 
restrictive. As a result, students who 
may have qualified for admission at 
three campuses in prior years will 
most likely receive one or two accep-
tances this year.

THURSDAY, JANUARY 29, 2009 THE UCSD GUARDIAN NEWS  3

Approval for the trial came just 
after the inauguration of President 
Barack Obama, who co-sponsored 
the Stem Cell Research Enhancement 
Act of 2007 and promised to repeal 
former President George W. Bush’s 
moratorium on federal funding 
for studies using embryonic stem-
cell lines, or batches, derived from 
embryos after August 9, 2001. 

“Many of our best investiga-
tions [at UCSD] have federal fund-
ing and they’ve been very limited 
on which stem-cell lines they can 
use,” Goldstein said. “Studies that 
receive private funds with nonfeder-
ally approved lines have been limited 
because equipment has been federally 
funded. We have to forgo the use of 
that equipment in those investiga-
tions.”

In California, private dona-
tions and funding made available 
by 2004’s passage of Proposition 71, 
which made $3 billion available for 

the development of human embry-
onic stem cells, have supported much 
of the research being conducted, 
including Keirstead’s and a portion of 
UCSD’s stem-cell research. 

Worldwide, 10 labs obtained stem-
cell lines prior to Bush’s announce-
ment, falling safely within the allowed 
guidelines for federal funding.

Geron’s trial would be eligible 
for federal funding regardless of the 
policy’s reversal as it uses one of the 
federally approved lines, and both 
Geron CEO, Thomas B. Okarma, 
and a spokesman for the Food and 
Drug Administration said poli-
tics had little to do with the trial’s 
approval. 

“[This trial] marks the dawn of 
a new era in medical therapeutics,” 
Okarma said. “This approach is one 
that reaches beyond pills and scalpels 
to achieve a new level of healing.”

ment, and one that rewards our ser-
vice workers for their continued hard 
work and dedication to the university,” 
she said. “The university worked very 
hard throughout the process to bring 
the negotiations to a successful con-
clusion, and ultimately compromises 
by both sides enabled us to reach an 
agreement.”

Lt. Gov. John Garamendi, a UC 
regent, was part of an outspoken coali-
tion of public officials supporting the 
union throughout negotiations by 
writing letters and meeting with uni-
versity officials.

“This is a good settlement,” he 
said. “It will give some of the lowest-

paid workers at the greatest university 
system in the world enough of a salary 
to meet the minimum needs of their 
families.”

He added that despite the uni-
versity’s repeated efforts to attribute 
the stalled negotiations to California’s 
budget crisis, the contract was largely 
independent of state funds.

“Only a small portion of the work-
er’s contract comes from the state bud-
get,” he said.

UCSD groundskeeper Jorge 
Olvera, who has led several dem-
onstrations on Library Walk in past 
months, said the contract is not per-
fect by any means. He cited parking, 
in particular, as a rising expense on 

which the university was unwilling to 
compromise. 

However, he called the contract 
a symbolic precedent for future UC 
labor negotiations.

“It’s a moral victory more than 
anything else,” he said. “This is a pub-
lic institution, and it belongs to the 
people of California. [The contract] is 
a step in the right direction in being 
able to change the culture of the uni-
versity.”

Harrison said she expects union 
members to ratify the contract by early 
next month.

Unlike last week, there was only one member of the public present in the forum cham-
bers at last night’s A.S. Council meet-
ing. Jackie Beoris came in as a rep-
resentative from the Global Brigade, 
a year-old organization that has been 
rapidly expanding and reaching out to 
university campuses nation-wide.

“I just wanted to speak to you to 
remind you that we exist and let you 
know that we may ask you for support 
in the future,” Beoris said.

Reports followed, during which 
Vice President 
of Student Life 
Darryl Nousome 
told the council on 
behalf of Associate 
Vice President of 
P r o g r a m m i n g 
Garrett Berg that 
all Death Cab for Cutie student tickets 
were sold, yielding $30,000 in ticket 
sales.

President Donna Bean remind-
ed everyone that there would be a 
meeting on Friday for those inter-
ested in running for office as part of 
the Student Voice! slate in the Spring 
Quarter general election. She added 
that there will soon be a discussion 
regarding the addition of a Loft fee 
provision on the general election bal-
lot in order to provide the funding that 
the Loft needs to survive.

There were few reports from com-
mittees, but conversation stalled for 
some 20 minutes on a request for $650 
from the Inter-Fraternity Council for 
Greek columns, which was sponsored 
by Associate Vice President of Athletic 
Relations Peter Benesch. 

Vice President of Finance and 
Resources Naasir Lakhani objected 
to the allocation on the basis that IFC 
had requested and was awarded the 
same amount the previous quarter.

“C’mon, its 650 bucks,” Associate 

Vice President of Student Advocacy 
Frank Carroll said. “Look at how 
much we fund the Koala!”

(For the record, the Koala is fund-
ed $2,500 per quarter.)  Ultimately, the 
council approved the allocation.

During open forum Lakhani told 
councilmembers that he would not 
be able to represent them in the Mr. 
Alpha Chi competition, prompting 
All-Campus Senator Chris Westling 
to quickly nominate Biological 
Sciences Senator Daniel Nguyen.

“Wait, are you serious?” Nguyen 
asked after a brief 
pause.  “What 
does this actually 
entail?”

L a k h a n i   
explained that he 
would be coached 
in the art of pag-

eantry and showcasing a talent. After 
several minutes of serious introspec-
tion, Nguyen announced that he had 
no discernable talent and respectfully 
declined the nomination.

Carroll then revealed a softer, 
more vulnerable side of himself, which 
momentarily sobered up the council.  
In recent weeks, councilmembers have 
come under a significant amount of 
criticism since the circulation of the 
first drafts of a resolution condemn-
ing the recent acts of violence in Gaza, 
deeply affecting certain councilmem-
bers, including Carroll.

“I’m not very emotional as you 
can tell by my nickname that’s been 
circulating around, ‘the Beast,’” Carroll 
said. “But I’m upset and offended by 
the accusations that I can’t do my job 
because of the color of my skin. I just 
want people to be careful and realize 
what they’re saying.”

The meeting, though not entirely 
sweet, was certainly shorter than last 
week’s, which dragged on for over 
six hours.

When California vot-ers narrowly approved Proposition 8 last 
November, the state constitu-
tion was amended to eliminate the 
right of same-sex couples to marry. 
Religious groups immediately hailed 
the victory as a defense for the tradi-
tional meaning of “marriage,” claim-
ing the one-man, one-woman insti-
tution should never be altered to 
accommodate changing attitudes or 
alternative views, while gay-rights 
advocates recoiled in shock, vow-
ing to press on in their struggle for 
equality. 

Both sides, however, vowed 
to defend their interests, with 
Proposition 8 opponents charging 
minority rights can never be taken 
away through popular vote and tra-
ditional-marriage supporters claim-
ing their cause had been vindicated 
once and for all. The California 
Supreme Court will have the ulti-
mate say when it revisits the issue 
later this year.

Meanwhile, John Muir College 
senior Ali Shams, along with 
California Institute of the Arts student 
Kaelan Housewright, have thrown 
a wrench into the machine, leading 
an initiative that would banish the 
word “marriage” from the state’s lexi-
con entirely, instead replacing it with 
“domestic partnership.” 

Their goal is to remove the reli-
gious connotations associated with 
marriage entirely by renaming all 
state-recognized unions as domestic 
partnerships, thus rendering them 
sociopolitical contracts rather than 

religious rituals. Aiming to appease 
pious citizens who refuse to budge 
on their antigay views, they see 
the initiative as a fair solution to 
the problem of semantics, allowing 
theologians to keep their allegedly 
unalterable practice while simulta-
neously granting equal recognition 
to all committed couples regardless 
of sexual orientation.

Although the move was meant 
with the noblest of intentions, the 
effort will most likely fail. Too many 
people won’t to give up their marriag-
es for an attempt at political correct-
ness, with the strongest opposition 
surely coming from Californians who 
might support expanding marriage 
rights to same-sex couples but who 
do not want to lose the meaning of 

their own marriages. 
No one dreams of “domestic 

partnering” the person they love; 
in our society, marriage is the term 
embraced by the vast majority of 
people — religious or atheist, gay or 
straight — and it is highly unlikely 
people will be willing to give up 
such a deeply ingrained institution 
so easily. 

However, by forcing Californians 
to confront the idea that their own 
heterosexual marriages could poten-
tially be reclassified, Shams and 
Housewright have opened up a new 
chapter in the fight for marriage 
equality. Hopefully, citizens will use 
this initiative as a means to realize 
that it is time to stop fighting about 
semantics, and expand the right to 

marry to their gay and lesbian neigh-
bors, or risk losing it altogether.

University of California President Mark G. Yudof ’s newest proposal to cover sys-
temwide fees for students whose fam-
ilies earn below $60,000 annually isn’t 
a radical concept: Not only are the 
1,100 students who would be affected 
by the plan already covered by federal 
aid and grant programs, but other 
prestigious research institutions have 
already adopted similar ideas.  Simply 
put, Yudof ’s proposal — named the 
Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan 
— is a public-relations move cre-
ated to make the already-available aid 
offered to low-income students seem 

more accessible.
And that’s exactly why it’s a good 

idea.
As worries of college afford-

ability grow with increasing inac-
cessibility to private loans, Gov. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger’s proposed 
Cal Grant cuts and the UC Board 
of Regents’ consideration to raise 
undergraduate student fees, many 
uniformed lower-income families 
whose children may be first-genera-
tion college applicants are unsure of 
whether they can afford a University 
of California education. By making 
a blanket guarantee for a certain 

income bracket and effectively pub-
licizing it to families, the univer-
sity will both restore confidence in 
higher education’s affordability and 
reduce confusing paperwork.

Even better, this measure’s annu-
al $3.1 million cost, which would 
come from increasing the amount 
of fee revenue reserved for financial 
aid from 33 percent to 36 percent, 
wouldn’t affect the grants offered to 
UC students with family incomes 
between $60,000 and $100,000, both 
ensuring full aid to low-income 
families without cutting that of the 
middle class. 

Paired with Yudof ’s proposals 
to increase next year’s transfer stu-
dent enrollment, the Blue and Gold 
Opportunity Plan would ultimately 
push for a greater racial and socio-
economic mix and support the UC 
system’s goals of providing higher 
education to all California residents 
— an aspect of the UC mission 
threatened by state budget cuts.

While it’s obvious this proposal 
is the same old financial-aid sys-
tem with a new title, at the very 
least it offers a spoonful of sugar to 
help struggling low-income families  
swallow sour economic times.

BEN HOLM/GUARDIAN

Gone are the days where an awkward elevator ride with a stranger would be filled 
with eerie silence. Instead, awk-
ward moments like these have been 
replaced with the fingers-punching-
digits click of phone keypads. But 
choosing your iPhone over a strang-
er is only the beginning. A coffee 
date to catch up with an old friend 
is no longer a sentimental conversa-
tion, but rather a series of paused, 
incomplete sentences, interrupted 

by an important text or e-mail. In 
this supposedly advanced century, 
our lives revolve around technology 
and texting; e-mail and Facebook 
make us the most disconnected gen-
eration, as simple human pleasures 
are left by the wayside.

Working at a classy Italian res-
taurant this summer, I witnessed 
the degree to which a certain fam-
ily of three had succumbed to tech-
nology’s firm and unforgiving grip. 
Every Saturday night, the mother 
and father entered the restaurant 
with their daughter trailing behind, 
laptop under her arm and head-
phones in ears. She sat down at the 
table, plugged into cyberspace and 
checked out of the real world. As 
her parents ate their pasta in silence, 
she remained fixated on the screen, 
shoveling food into her mouth with-
out so much as a blink, only occa-
sionally looking up to make sure she 
hadn’t spilled any tomato sauce on 
her Macbook. Her parents made no 
attempt to engage her in conversa-
tion, as though they had given up 
hope of interaction, and had sur-
rendered her to technology’s pull. I 
couldn’t help but wonder what was 
so damn important on the computer 
screen. Was it a photo of Lindsay 
Lohan’s private business? A new 
addition to Lolcats.com? Whatever 
she was looking at was pretty capti-
vating; she didn’t even flinch when 
our delicious dessert tray rolled by. 

But a constant laptop connection 
isn’t the only techno-heroin drip 
our generation fiends over. Thanks 
to the cell phone, we’ll never be 
alone again. Although it is an admit-
tedly practical accessory, it’s also 
the reason the text-crazy 10-year-
old social butterfly can’t wait until 
recess to share life issues with her 
besties, and the cause for couples 
— no longer defined by spit-swap-
ping — to worry if their PDAs (per-
sonal digital assistants) will deliver 
“ILY” texts. 

Even high-school archetypes 
— like jocks or prom kings —  are 
being redefined by telecommunica-
tion. Renamed “texting kings” in 
my high-school friend circle, these 
Casanovas knew all too well how to 
make a girl swoon with a smooth, 
wink-faced emoticon or a noncha-
lant “how you doin’?’” text. Forget  
old-fashioned dinner dates: these 
boys got the job done with a swift 
button press and lived for their 
unlimited texting plans. Boy and 
girl did everything from flirt to fight

NATIONAL NEWS — All across 
the country, students, teachers and 
administrators gave a small sigh of 
relief as the $819 billion economic 
stimulus bill containing $150 bil-
lion for education made it through 
the House of Representatives yes-
terday. Now, they are holding their 
breaths once again, anxiously await-
ing Senate approval of the American 
Recovery and Reinvestment Act — a 
bill that will increase the federal Pell 
Grant budget from $19 billion to 
$27 billion and provide extra aid to 
school districts, special education 
and pre-kindergarten programs. 

The bill provides a short-term 

boost in education funding, which 
is particularly essential for stu-
dents who fall on the socioeco-
nomic scale’s lower end and rely on 
Pell Grants to finance their college 
tuitions. The maximum amount of 
Pell funds will be raised to $4,860 
per student for the 2009-10 award 
year. This bill is one step closer to 
achieving President Barack Obama’s 
campaign promise of increasing Pell 
Grants while at the same time keep-
ing up with college inflation. Obama 
plans to expand the Pell Grant to 
$5,400 per student in the next few 
years. With the proposed cuts for 
Cal Grants and ever-rising tuitions, 
other means may be needed to com-
pensate, and the Pell increase will 
help blunt the blow of any cuts.

By adding $1.6 billion to Title I 
programs — those that support stu-
dents in low-income families — in 
California, the bill will also resus-
citate No Child Left Behind, largely 
criticized by educators for demand-
ing high standards without financial 
support. According to the Forum 

on Educational Accountability, the 
Bush Administration’s budget fell 
$15 billion short of the amount 
Congress and the administration 
authorized for NCLB in 2007. With 
proper funding, NCLB can promote 
student performance, rather than 
punish failing schools. By giving 
this program more funding, educa-
tors will come to respect NCLB not 
just for its high-minded ideals but 
also for its ability to support schools 
while encouraging greater account-
ability.

Students in California with learn-
ing disabilities would also receive 
$1.4 billion through the Individuals 
with Disabilities Education Act, leg-
islation that oversees and guides spe-
cial-education programs. I.D.E.A. 
has been criticized as an unfunded 
mandate, receiving less than a quar-
ter of Congress’s pledged funds. The 
process of fully funding programs 
to help special-education students 
must start again, because these 
students require additional atten-
tion and support early on to help 

them become independent mem-
bers of society, which will reduce 
the requirement for social services 
later on.

While the bill’s passage may have 
been necessary to address short-term 
needs, it must be molded in a way 
that will create a solid foundation 
for future progress. New York Times 
columnist David Brooks called the 
entire stimulus package a “muddled 
mixture of short-term stimulus haste 
and long-term spending commit-
ments.” However, the last eight years 
have shown that high expectations 
cannot be paired with a lack of sup-
port. Politicians are finally putting 
their money where their mouths are, 
and with adequate oversight their 
investments will pay off in the long 
run. To not pass the bill would sim-
ply leave the job of economic recov-
ery to a generation of students who 
remain largely uneducated and thus 
unable to meaningfully contribute 
to the taxpayer system.

THURSDAY, JANUARY 29, 2009 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5

without ever having to communi-
cate face to face, and when one such 
king cheated on his girl at a random 
party, her only option was to text a 
sad face paired with  “we’re over.”

But, of all the distracting techie 
toys available, there is one ultimate 
Web site controlling our social 
prowess and networking ability: 
Facebook. It becomes clear times 
have changed when we no longer see 
gifts as the physical manifestation of 
someone’s appreciation wrapped in 
a bow, but rather a digital balloon 
appearing as one new notification 
on our news feeds. Bumper stickers 
are no longer for decorating cars, 
instead taking the form of Edward 
Cullen pictures plastered on your 
wall. And no, I don’t mean your 
bedroom wall.

Facebook is such a priority that  
choosing the right profile picture 
takes precedence over a four-page 
English essay, without question. 
Even if your relationship status 
claims you’re single, anyone with 
the sense to view your wall-to-wall 
convos knows exactly how you feel 
about that certain someone. And, 

most importantly, you know last 
night wasn’t a success until a photo 
album has been posted of your 
drunken adventures.

So the next time you pause from 
your current, intense text fight and 
notice there’s an old friend with 
coffee across from you, please take 
a step back. Our reliance on what 
we deem to be the advantages of 
modernity is diminishing necessary 
human interaction. The rapid growth 
of technology is inevitable, but I 
implore you to remember where we 
came from. Not so long ago, people 
had survived for centuries without 
a wireless Internet connection, and 
boys still got laid without seductive 
text messages. So, when you’re done 
reading this column and you begin 
typing the Facebook Web address 
into your laptop browser, shut the 
computer off and walk away. Go 
outside or talk to your roommate. 
Overcoming our addiction to con-
stant social connection takes time, 
but someday we’ll have to learn how 
to have a real conversation. And if 
you don’t make the decision to give 
your BlackBerry a rest, carpal tun-
nel will for you.

THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN By Niven Wilson Art of  Conversation, Humanity 
Lost Between Incessant Texts

▶ TIES, from page 4

But even with all its positive 
and necessary funding, the bill con-
tains questionable provisions that 
reek of special interests — more 
specifically, a provision that would 
temporarily increase subsidies for 
banks in the student-loan program. 
This could be likened to the inef-
fective bank bailouts, after which 
bank lenders tightened credit stan-
dards and, according to a New York 
Times report, students had a harder 
time qualifying for private loans. 
As this bill currently stands, it con-
tradicts Obama’s campaign plan 
to eliminate government subsidies 
and guarantees for banks and lend-

ers, and undermines his goal of 
allowing greater student access to 
loans. The bill’s problems are not 
unsolvable and can be amended to 
ensure taxpayer money isn’t being 
misused.

Obama’s new Education Secretary 
Arne Duncan must ensure this 
boost in funding over a two-year 
period will be used efficiently and 
will remain consistent with Obama’s 
education policy goals — such as 
removing complex financial-aid 
forms like the FAFSA, and creating 
a program to make students aware 
of their college readiness early on.

An increased government role in 
education will not solve all the sys-

tem’s troubles — $150 billion won’t 
convince students of the importance 
of college nor will it be the sole 
factor in determining their success 
later on down the road. What it does 
provide is a lifeline and an opportu-
nity for students to succeed.

With a competitive global econ-
omy, there is not a moment to waste 
in investing in America’s future. As 
America rises out of its economic 
collapse, it needs educated citizens 
who will fill jobs and generate taxes. 
This bill is the first step toward that 
recovery.

Katy Perry & the Daylights

Rumor has it that Katy Perry’s going acoustic 
for ‘09. The momentary princess of bi-curious 
radiopop released the admittedly less lipsticky 
“Thinking of You,” a leaf-turning ballad that’s 
winning brownie points from her numerous critics. 
Though it might sound more at home on an angsty 
alt-rock record, who’s to say a girl can’t reinvent 
herself? Along for the ride are the Daylights, the 
lucky junior stadium-rockers touring with the 
biggest pop-tart since Britney. Reminiscent of 
U2 deities (minus the price of sterling production 
quality) the band delivers Coldplay-worthy tunes 
that could herald a couple sold-out gigs. (AC)

“The Wild Child”

Peeling off his meteoric success with French new wave 
in the ’60s, Francois Truffaut continued to deliver hits like 
a hired hand well into the next decade. “The Wild Child” 
stars the director himself as benign Dr. Jean Itard, in the 
true story of a child found living alone in the 18th-century 
woods of France, unable to speak and savagely independent. 
Lacquered in a tame black-and-white cinematography, the 
trope of youth finds an apex in the famed director’s newly 
restored coming-of-age chronicle. The classic runs for one 
week only at Ken Cinemas. (EG)

Suburban Buzzkill: Hutchinson Sobers Up the Pub

W
hat does California sound like?” 
asks Steven Schick into his cell 
phone, to me and to himself, reach-
ing for a chair in a hotel room 

somewhere in San Francisco. He has freshly arrived 
via BART from the East Bay after flying in from San 
Diego, and will soon depart for a weekend of per-
cussion-course planning in the Canadian Rockies 
(“just about as beautiful a place as you’ll find on 
the planet”).

Seeing as Schick is the one between the two 
of us who, a couple years back, took a six-week, 
716-mile stroll up the California coast to record its 
noise in slowness and openness, I let him answer 
the question.

“It sounds like people speaking different lan-
guages, it sounds like construction, it sounds like 
the ocean, it sounds like traffic, it sounds like a — a 
lot of things, things that have become important to 
us that we don’t even notice anymore. And if we 
forget what things sound like, then we pretty soon 
forget who we are, I think.”

Schick is far more regal a UCSD landmark than 
“The Cat in the Hat” or the stone bear; his office is 
a secret garden of grand percussion instruments; 
he has worked with Philip Glass and John Cage 
but would love to work with you in office hours. 
Anyone who’s even come so far as to graze the outer 
rungs of the music department has a story about 
him, or has heard one, or at least thinks he must be 
wonderful. The Beatles class he taught for decades 
and finally let lie last year — soon to be no more 
than a legend, as all who bore witness make their 
way out into the world — will go down in campus

F ollowing in the giant footsteps of his soul-ful idols — Billy Joel, Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson — Eric Hutchinson claims 
he needs to sing like he needs to breathe. But he 
doesn’t stop at the shower: According to his Web 
site, he sings at coffeehouses and funerals with 
equal timbre. 

Unfortunately, all that practice couldn’t keep his 
third album, August 2007’s Sounds Like This, from 
deflating. A jumbled reincarnation of Jason Mraz, 
Jack Johnson and Adam Levine, Hutchinson’s eerily 
familiar take on the sensitive young songwriter 
fails to transcend that boy-meets-girl pop grooves 
formula.

But maybe we should cut Hutchy some slack 
— after all, la-la land can be a tough gig. A brand-
new addition to the music biz, the Maryland native 

graduated from Emerson College in 2001; a film 
degree, along with a reputation as an open-mic 
regular in Boston, fueled the dream that prompted 
his starry-eyed move to Los Angeles. He released 
2003’s popcorn debut That Could’ve Gone Better, on 
Madonna’s Let’s Break Records — but six months 
later, the lucky streak was halted by parent company 
Warner Bros, who decided to drop Hutch from 
their lineup. At the end of his rope and scrambling 
for lunch money, the hopeful managed to squeeze 
out Before I Sold Out, with tracks like “Breakdown 
More” and “Outside Villanova” spinning through 
pervasive loneliness and sex with minors, highlight-
ing his darker corners and blues-rooted soul. 

Anxious to pull Hutchinson out of his funk, a 
friend recently sent notorious gossip blogger Perez

THURSDAY, JANUARY 29, 2009 THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS  7

By Steven Ren
Contributing Writer

R egardless of how insultingly predictable a film is, it can (and will) still appeal to a major por-tion of the nation — as long as its starring faces 
are pretty enough to watch. With blonde-then-bru-
nette, frail-then-fat Hollywood chameleon Renée 
Zellweger as the featured vehicle in “New in Town,” 
the cheeseball flick is destined to draw an enthusi-
astic crowd of Bridget Jones diehards. 

It all seemed so promising — an Oscar-win-
ning bombshell and a Danish director (Jonas 
Elmer), distant enough from the grave chick-
flick epidemic that has overtaken our magnifi-
cent shores. Alas, Elmer has obviously done his 
research thoroughly, studying popular American 
film culture enough to slop out a sapfest as for-
mulaic and underwhelming as any other love-
potioned Joe Shmoe could in Hollywood.

So here’s the gist (which you could probably 
gather from the minute-long commercial alone): 
Lucy Hill (Zellweger) is a majorly stressing high-
up exec at some deathly important, suspiciously 
immoral corporation — you know, the kind with 
all the douchy ties walking around like they’ve 
got more than a couple things to hide. When her 
co-workers decide that one of the corporation’s 

ramshackle factories is costing them money, Hill 
volunteers to get her hands dirty. She plans to 
inspect the factory and retrain its workers, willing 
to terminate those who can’t quite meet the chal-
lenge. But there’s a twist: The factory is located in 
Minnesota — a far cry from the sandy paradise of 
Hill’s Miami hometown. 

But this blue-collar beauty is blinded by a 
hunger to climb the corporate ladder (why she 
didn’t just sleep her way to the top will always be a 
mystery), and thus books the next available flight 
to Middle America. A true maverick.

Surprise, surprise — it turns out that the state 
of many lakes might as well be a different planet. 
Not only is the weather 10 times too chilly, but the 
townies are completely pedestrian. And everyone 
wears ugly shoes. Zellweger’s arrival recalls that 
infamous “Legally Blonde” entrance, sans Reese 
Witherspoon’s glimmer of smarts to offest that 
thick veneer of West-Coast idiocy. 

Thankfully, Hill doesn’t scorn the wintry nights 
for long. Enter Ted Mitchell (Harry Connick Jr.), 
sporting a rather somber face — a face he wears 
for the length of the film — who pretends to 
despise the shapely suit sent from Florida to lay 
down the law. The consummation of their secret 
love is deterred by a classic element of conflict 
that shouldn’t have been attempted at all, because 
we’re just waiting for them to make out.

As mentioned, Connick, Jr. is set on stone-face 
autopilot, and, for the immobility of mouth,  deliv-
ers all his lines in a crusty monotone. Zellwegger 
is charming enough, but at the ripe age of 39, her 
perpetual sucking-on-a-lemon face has reached 
new extremes, with a pout that almost never 
unpuckers. An obligatory supporting cast is 

thrown into the mix for comedic value, but 
they don’t seem ready for even that job.

One exception is J.K. Simmons (known 
for his hilarious portrayal of J. Jonah 
Jameson in the “Spider Man” films), who 
plays the exaggerated Stu Kopenhaffer. 
Simmons has so long been cast as the loud, 
sardonic, fast-speaking boss that he’s a true 
master at it, and highlights the film with a 
glowing performance that almost makes 
the film worth watching. Almost.

history as the most coveted gen-ed course of all 
time, with sit-inners spilling out the double doors 
and a waitlist like a battleground. 

But Schick moves on and resettles where he 
is needed. Last year, on top of professorship, he 
was named conductor of the La Jolla Symphony 
and Chorus, and has since created a course in 
the fall devoted entirely to lab-studying their 
rehearsals. “Oftentimes in the professional musi-
cal world, you play a concert with these groups of 
people, a little bit like what I’m doing this week 
— here, then going somewhere else, and the 
scenery changes all the time,” he says. “To see the 
same group time after time after time, rehearsal 
after rehearsal, and to develop a rapport, a way 
of working with the same group, has been just 
fascinating.”

It was only a matter of time before Schick’s 
ambitions made their way over to the Loft. The 
new campus venue’s hallmark mission — and 
ultimately what makes its new-car smell so hard 
to get rid of, as the over-eclectic, hyper-hip deliv-
ery is often clunky  — is to help high art off its 
gilded easel and rephrase it in colloquial terms, 
then squeeze it nice and chummy (but still A-line, 
still in the know) into that comfortingly corpo-
rate corner of Price Center. Event coordinators 
aim to show students the ins and outs of snotty 
traditions such as fine wine and string concertos, 
and reveal how nonscary — even how pleasant 
— those things can be.

Schick’s vision for the new La Jolla Symphony 
Informances series is shrouded in similar educa-
tion-meets-entertainment ideals. Only difference 
is, unlike the somewhat traditionless (at no fault 
of their own) foundations of the Loft, this music-
department darling and good king of Mandeville 
is equipped with the long-standing respect, ado-
ration and hard-earned hipness one can only 
wear after years at the helm of the scene.

That said, the agenda for Feb. 4 — following 
up a Dec. 4 Informance that set Tijuana dancers 
ablaze with Indonesian compositions on which 
to troupe — is almost inconceivably burdened 
with ambition, continuing in the sccatterbrained 
tradition of the Loft’s everything-goes lineup. 

Branching off the La Jolla Symphony’s yearlong 
“DNA of music” theme is the show-specific 
focus on “Home,” weighted by an obligation to 
tribute Abraham Lincoln and Charles Darwin’s 
200th birthdays, and meanwhile adhere to Black 
History Month with pieces by black composers 
and a dialogue on their place in the history of 
classical music. Schick’s idea is to pull themes 
and elements (pianist here, budding UCSD com-
poser there) from the formal La Jolla Symphony 
concert that will take place on the following 
weekend, mixing them up with a little hump-day 
art dialogue and making a night of it.

“Rather than coming simply to a symphony 
orchestra concert, hearing an hour and a half 
or two hours of music and that’s it, we create a 
companion concert that will flesh some of those 
themes out,” Schick says. And in doing so, in 
letting everyone in on the varitable rehearsal din-
ner and brainstorming phase before the formal 
Mandeville sit-down, his humble excitement for 
dialogue shows promise in melting those artier-
than-thou barriers the Loft often fumbles to 
topple. “We’re going to have a discussion also of 
the relationship of so-called art music — and I 
don’t know what to call it, I don’t like that term, 
but you know, music that’s destined for the con-
cert stage — we’re going to talk about if there’s 
a social component to that music. Should we 
be involved in our community? Should we care 
about political and social events? Or should we 
care more?”

If he finds the time — and that’s definitely 
an if, at this rate — Schick would love to retrace 
John Muir’s steps from San Francisco to Yosemite 
Valley, absorbing that much more of California’s, 
and therefore our own, natural sounds. But for 
now, he’s here with us, evolved from a lifetime of 
experiments into the conductor we need. “You 
know, the raw material of art — you don’t make 
art if you don’t have hope,” he said. “Art is about 
the future.” And so we get started.

The La Jolla Symphony and Chorus’ Informance 
event “Home” will take place Feb. 4 from 7 p.m. to 
8:30 p.m. at the Loft in Price Center East. For the

8  HIATUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, JANUARY 29, 2009

THURSDAY, JANUARY 29, 2009 THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS  9

PAPARAZZI QUEEN SETS TWEENS 
INTO HUTCHEADED FRENZY

Hilton listed it as a top 10 fave on 
his Web site, garnering millions of 
hits literally overnight. 

In nearly every interview, 
Hutchinson still incredulously recalls 
how, within a few weeks, he had rock-
eted all the way to No. 9 on iTunes’ 
most-sold list. At the time, he claimed 
he barely knew who Hilton was. 

Predictably, Warner Bros. pulled 
an “Oh, my bad,” welcoming him 
back to the label with open arms. 
Suddenly, he had fans calling them-
selves Hutcheads. White-bread 
America wore him as proud as its 
pastel Uggs and Abercrombie hood-
ies, blasting sugary, summer-bar-
beque tunes and extra-cheese odes 
to “Rock and Roll” that sound more 
like Jason Mraz B-sides.

And why should generation 
Britney care? On “Okay, It’s All Right 
With Me,” Hutchinson’s skipping 
right with them, borrowing Maroon 
5’s trademark nasality to spin the 
kind of apathy one can only feel with 
a nothing-else-matters mouthful of 
cotton candy. Dwindling love? “Not 
the same/ But it’s all right with me,” 

he croons. 
The love ballad is, after all, a staple 

of the soul-rock gods our Hutchead 
worships. He stretches farthest toward 
“She Will Be Loved” romance on the 
gravelly “It Hasn’t Been Long Enough” 
— a rough-edged, scratched-up gasp 
for air under waves of deep blue jazz. 
For a moment there, as he admits 
“I think I’ve been wrong enough to 
know when I’m right,” we forget the 
smiling press shots long enough to let 
one heartstring snap.

Tapping into this secret, char-
coaled sadness will almost certainly 
garner success beyond his 10,000-
plus MySpace fans. He’s already 
won the Yahoo! Music users’-choice 
award, and his clap-happy single 
“Rock and Roll” recently reached No. 
11 on VH1’s Top 20 Countdown. Just 
maybe, if he can sink a little dark-
er into the caverns of his self-pro-
claimed “acoustic soul,” Hutchinson 
might one day be selling just as many 
UCSD-rack Valentine’s compilations 
as the olden-day idols he so esteems.

Eric Hutchinson will play for free 
at the Pub on Thursday, Jan. 29. 
Doors open at 8 p.m.

Blackout Beach
■ Skin of Evil
SOFT ABUSE

P ressing play on Carey Mercer’s second solo album Skin of Evil feels almost shamefully invasive, like stumbling upon something you weren’t meant to witness. It’s a 
dirty, shivering comedown from Mercer’s work with his 
band Frog Eyes — still gothic but more desperate and scat-
tered, a collage of riffs stolen from blues and baroque pop to 
noise, whirled into sensational chaos.

It opens with a pulsating, trance-inducing beat that ebbs 
and rises throughout the album, reappearing erratically and 
without warning. Each impulsive track is virtually indistin-
guishable from the last, as Mercer never quite reveals where 
one ends and the next begins.

It’s not that Skin of Evil is repetitive; its compositions are 
simply unconstrained by numbers. The album lets us forget 
its identity as a collection of recordings and becomes noth-
ing more than a mood, a glimpse of experience to which 
Mercer is allowing us privvy. His work could be classified as 
experimental or conceptual, but that wouldn’t do justice to 

the album’s complete departure from familiar compositional 
techniques. Its hallucinogenic, echoing guitars sweep in and 
out, reaching crescendo before slipping away, coming back 
to life in the form of Mercer’s haunting voice. He comes to us 
from somewhere far away, eerie cries building to deep wailing. 
Like a phantom wanderer wearing the haggard scars of a man 
long imprisoned, he bemoans a life misled and deeds better 
left undone. At times, lyrics froth over into the stormy, non-
sensical mutterings of a schizophrenic plotting murder. 

Without his bandmates to counsel him, Skin of Evil 
finds Mercer pervaded by a heavy sadness; voices and their 
echoes and uncertain beats swirl into a painful and troubled 
density that only its creator could understand. For the rest 
of us, though, that isolation proves arresting, captivating and 
remarkably unresolved.

White Lies
■ To Lose My Life
POLYDOR

T he new incarnation of London trio White Lies attempts to recall the darker side of UK post-punk, in the merg-ing of dark church organs and overwrought synths 
with a thundering backdrop of bass. A brooding Harry 
McVeigh recalls his adolescence with aching desolation; 
ghoulish murder tales and allegories are underscored with 
the most dramatic of their compositions, as a frozen apoca-
lypse catapults us far into the depths of disco.

“I love the feeling when we lift off/ Watching the world 
so small below/ I love the dreaming when I think of/ The 
safety in the clouds out my window” chides the tortured 
Brit with a dreamlike stupor on “Death,” summoning us 
into his chilling nightmare.

Raw instrumentation is soon swapped for the slick pro-
duction on title track “To Lose My Life,” with a sparkling 
reverb lending the London trio a hollow industrialism. The 
title track shakes with doom, gloom and swirling, razor-

sharp guitars, unabashedly borrowing from contemporaries 
in the likes of the Editors, Franz Ferdinand and the Killers. 
By the halfway mark, the trio’s repeated crescendos start to 
grind a little too formulaic, a subdued tension always on 
the cusp of spilling over into unadulterated revelation, but 
never quite achieving that release. The finales predictably 
buzz with moody, wistful synths and crashing drums. 

The one exception to the torment is “Unfinished 
Business.” Sunnily strumming to an upbeat, tightly 
wound thump, McVeigh menacingly demands, “Get off 
your low/ Let’s dance like we used to.” But even where 
White Lies try to pick up the pace, they certainly leave 
unfinished business in refining their brand beyond the 
ease of emulation.

THURSDAY, JANUARY 29, 2009 THE UCSD GUARDIAN SPORTS  11

and a superhero can be found in 
Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner. 
Since taking over from Matt Leinart 
in the preseason, Warner has put 
together a remarkable year. With 
wide receivers Larry Fitzgerald, 
Anquan Boldin and the emergence 
of Steve Breaston — along with a 
strong running game led by young 
running backs Tim Hightower and 
J.J. Arrington and the experienced 
Edgerrin James — the Cardinals had 
all the elements needed to be an 
offensive powerhouse. However, it 
was Warner who pulled everything 
together, solidifying a spot in the Hall 
of Fame with one more great season, 
even though his enshrinement was 
previously far from a hot topic. 

However, the Batman analogy 
does not really hold up when it comes 
to Warner’s success story; whereas 
the quarterback went from super-
market bag boy to two-time League 
MVP, Bruce Wayne was already a rich 
mofo before he went off to get some 
training, and came back to clean up 
the streets better than McNulty on 
“The Wire.”

The Fitzgerald/Boldin duo might 
serve as a better superhero tandem. 
Fitzgerald has quietly evolved into 
the best receiver in the game. Like 
Marvin Harrison in his prime, other 
receivers get more talk time and hype, 
but it’s Fitzgerald who constantly 
comes through. Boldin is an equally 
impressive player, perhaps more so, 
considering that he was a second-
round pick with one of the greatest 
rookie seasons ever by a receiver, 
and continued to excell even when 
All-World talent Fitzgerald joined 
the team. Furthermore, Boldin was 
able to make the Pro Bowl even after 
having a plate inserted into his face.

Boldin has suffered some criti-
cism lately for seemingly walking out 
on the NFC Championship celebra-
tion because he was angry about his 

lack of inclusion. This role of mis-
understood superstar only furthers 
the comparison to Batman, another 
hero without the credit he deserves. 
The problem with a receiver is that 
someone else has to deliver him the 
ball. Batman went to Hong Kong 
and brought back Lau all on his own, 
because unlike Keyshawn Johnson, 
Batman doesn’t need anyone to get 
him the damn ball — he just takes it.

Looking at the Steelers, the quar-
terback is once again the most obvi-
ous target for comparison. After all, 

Pittsburgh QB Ben Roethlisberger 
and Batman both love riding motor-
cycles, though Batman is at least smart 
enough to wear a helmet not to men-
tion a bulletproof suit. Roethlisberger 
is a good, young quarterback, and 
undoubtedly can set himself ahead of 
Rivers and Manning as the best of the 
2004 QB class with a second Super 
Bowl win. However, Hines Ward was 
the MVP of the first Super Bowl, and 
even if Big Ben is named MVP after 
this game, few would argue that he’s 
been the most valuable player on his 
team.

What the Steelers deem most 
valuable is instead their defense. Yes, 
Troy Polamulu’s hair more closely 
resembles the Joker than anything, 
but this is a strong, disciplined unit, 
whereas there probably will never be 

another person, performance, or acid 
trip comparable to the craziness of 
Heath Ledger as the Joker. While the 
Steelers’ defense does not conjure up 
that same status as an all-time great 
unit, with Polamulu and linebacker 
James Harrison leading the way, this 
defense can still be scary good.

The old adage is that defense 
wins championships, and the last 
time that a great offensive and great 
defensive team met, another vet-
eran QB Rich Gannon was inter-
cepted into oblivion. The Cardinals’ 
defense has played remarkably well 
throughout the postseason, includ-
ing a humiliation of Panther Jake 
Delhomme and a first-half beat-
down of Eagles’ Donovan McNabb. 
The Steelers’ defense, while hold-
ing up in wins over San Diego and 
Baltimore, has yet to pull off the 
same kind of spectacle. However, 
maybe the most important com-
parison is not between a team or 
its players as Batman, but between 
the Cardinals’ defense and Two-
Face. While putting the pressure on 
Delhomme, McNabb and Matt Ryan 
in the playoffs, Arizona also allowed 
over 30 points to be scored five times 
during the season, including 56 to 
the Jets, 48 to the Eagles and 47 to 
the Patriots. The Arizona defense 
offers a scary side to the Cardinals’ 
feel-good coin. 

No doubt an Arizona win would 
continue the tradition the Giants 
started last year of exhilarating upsets, 
and meanwhile provide a perfect end 
to the season for a surprising, excit-
ing team and a likable quarterback. 
Unfortunately, that quarterback is a 
fumble-prone target for the Steelers, 
who may not be flashy but know how 
to win. 

The Cardinals might be the cham-
pion the Super Bowl deserves, but not 
the ones it needs right now.

Joe goes with: Steelers 34, Cardinals 
30.

Two-Faced Arizona Defense Won’t Win Super Bowl
▶ JOE, from page 12

The practice round before com-
petition would have allowed players 
to gauge the difficulty of the course 
— especially the greens — and 
allowed for the golfers to make nec-
essary adjustments. Less-than-ideal 
weather conditions further compli-
cated play.

“It was really windy and really 
cold,” Samra said. “It was tough con-
ditions not only for us, but for the 
other teams too. The fast greens were 
giving everyone trouble in that first 
round.”

After becoming familiar with the 
course in the first round, Samra fired 
a 2-over par 74 in the second, the 
third lowest score in the competi-
tion.

Sophomore Keith Okasaki saw 
similar progress, improving nearly 

10 strokes from his first round score 
by the end of the second  round.

“This was our first tourna-
ment since October,” Samra said. 
“Personally, it is a little different get-
ting back into the flow … We’re dis-
appointed with how we played, but 
we just need to get going again.”

Finally warming up after the long 
break from competition, the team 
will now shift its focus onto the 
Cal State San Marcos Invitational in 
February, with hopes of improving 
on a middle-of-the-pack, 10th place 
finish at last year’s invitational.

“We’re going to go out to the Buck 
[Invitational] and learn how its done 
— lick our wounds and learn from 
our mistakes,” Wydra said.

by one.
The match began to unravel for 

the outnumbered UCSD players in the 
second period, as the Cougars scored a 
quick goal within the first two minutes 
to take a 4-2 lead, capitalizing on the 
tired Triton lines. Unlike during the 
first period, the Cougars dominated the 
time of posession in the second, relent-
ly pushing the puck up to UCSD’s goal. 
Gilmore connected on the only Triton 
goal while the Cougars added five more 
scores before the second intermission. 

“Our short bench took a toll on us,” 
junior captain Casey Gong said. “We 
only had two lines and they had four 
lines — that was the biggest difference 
in the game.”

In complete control of the contest, 
the Cougars took a 9-4 lead into the 
third period. One of the very few bright 
spots for the Tritons in the game was 
Gilmore’s first career hat trick, account-
ing for most of UCSD’s goals.

“Jackson is usually a defender but 
it was one of those games when we 
needed a veteran to step up and he did,” 
Gong said.

UCSD was plagued with injuries 
and ineligibilities all season, resulting 
in a disappointing 3-10 record.

“It was a rough season but we’re not 
losing too many players so next season 
should be better,” Gong said.

CARDINALS 
DESTINED 

TO BE NFL’S 
‘DARK KNIGHT’
When the Academy Award nominations were announced, I was left a 
little saddened not because I’m judg-
ing the films that were nominated for 
Best Picture; rather, I feel remorse 
for a film that wasn’t nominated and 
should have been. 

There was only one movie that left 

me with the notion of what an award-
winning movie should be. (Actually, 
there were two, but I think my enjoy-
ment of “Pineapple Express” might 
have been due to other factors.) 

The film I’m speaking of is “The 
Dark Knight,” the new Batman movie 
— no, not the one with Martin 
Lawrence as a medieval knight. Now, 
since this is technically a sports col-
umn, I won’t go on a long rant about 
why “The Dark Knight” deserved 
to be nominated; instead, it seems 
only fitting to compare the two Super 
Bowl teams — the Arizona Cardinals 
and Pittsburgh Steelers — to the film, 
perhaps helping me to make a Super 
Bowl XLIII prediction.

The first and most obvious simi-
larity between a Super Bowl player 

By Cameron Tillisch

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL — Coming off 
a winless week, the Tritons looked to 
turn their momentum around against 
UC Irvine and UCLA on the road. 
Unfortunately, they failed to squeeze 
out a victory against either UC pow-
erhouse.

On Jan. 23 at the Pauley Pavilion 
in Los Angeles, the team faced another 
daunting task, this time against the No. 
8 UCLA Bruins. UCLA pulled out no 
stops, handing the Tritons their second 
sweep of the week. The sets came out 
30-26, 35-33 and 30-22 in UCLA’s favor, 
as the Bruins cruised to victory.

Despite the loss, a few Tritons posted 
solid individual efforts, including junior 
opposite hitter Frank Fritsch, who fin-
ished with an impressive 20 kills on .552 
hitting. Ehrman chipped in with 10 kills 
and Leserman added seven digs.

Sophomore setter Phil Bannan lent 
40 assists, while sophomore middle 
back Calvin Ross and Fritsch contrib-
uted three blocks apiece.

UCLA was led by junior outside hit-
ter Garrett Muagututia at 15 kills, while 
freshman opposite hitter Kyle Caldwell 
and freshman quick hitter Thomas 
Amberg added 10 kills each.

With the loss, the Tritons drop to 
1-4 overall, and 0-3 in the Mountain 
Pacific Sports  Federation, while UCLA 
improves to 3-4, 2-2 MPSF.

On Jan. 21, the Tritons traveled to 
Irvine for a tough match at Crawford 
Court against the Anteaters. UCSD 
defeated the 2007 National Champion 
Anteaters twice in 2008, but could not 
seem to handle them Wednesday night: 
While UC Irvine hit a .517 clip, the 
Tritons managed a measly .218.

The opening set was the tightest of 
the evening for the Tritons, who pulled 
to within 17-15 after a kill by redshirt 

sophomore outside hitter Will Ehrman. 
A kill from sophomore outside hitter 
Joel Davidson pulled the Tritons to 
within two, but the Anteaters quickly 
opened up a six-point advantage and 
finished the set with a 30-24 win.

The second set was commanded by 
UC Irvine, with the Anteaters jumping 
out to a 22-16 lead. The Tritons were 
unable to come back, and Irvine cruised 
to a 30-22 victory. In the third set, the 
Tritons and Anteaters were tied at six, 
until UC Irvine went on a tear to score 
seven straight points for a 13-7 lead. 
UCSD never recovered and UC Irvine 
easily won the final set 30-19.

“We’ve been going through a rough 
patch, both in terms of how we were 
playing as a team and the teams we were 
playing against,” Ehrman said. “Irvine 
played awesome ... but we just didn’t 
bring it. For us to beat a team like that, 
we have to play our best.”

Sophomore outside hitter Joel 
Davidson led the losing Tritons with 10 
kills on .353 hitting, while sophomore 
middle back Calvin Ross added eight 
kills on .727 hitting. Senior libero Eric 
Leserman finished with a team-high 
five digs.

“When we play league games, those 
teams are the best teams [in the nation],” 
Davidson said of UCSD’s elite competi-
tion. “The thing that Coach Ring always 
says is that we can’t look at UC San 
Diego as just a Division-II school. We 
have to look at it like [UC Irvine] is a  
team and we’re a team and we just have 
to play. Once you’re on the court it’s 
pretty easy to do that.”

After a tough four-game road trip, 
the Tritons returned  home on Jan. 28, 
hoping to turn their season around 
against Princeton University. Scores 
were not available at press time.

CLUB SPORTS — A season filled with 
disappointments and unfortunate cir-
cumstances has fittingly ended in frus-
tration for the UCSD club ice hockey 
team. College of the Canyons handed 
the Tritons an 11-5 defeat at UTC Ice 
Town on Jan. 24 one night after UCSD 
was shut out in a 12-0 loss to San Diego 
State University. The two losses came 
after a promising weekend in which the 
Tritons came out victorious against Cal 
State Sacramento on Jan. 16 and UC 
Davis on Jan. 17. 

“Coming into the final games, we 
were trying to play smart defense and 
not take too many penalties,” junior 
captain Casey Gong said. “We had a 
couple players hurt and knew it was 
going to be tough.”

After the demoralizing loss to 
SDSU, the Tritons came out strong 
against College of the Canyons look-
ing to finish the season on a high 
note. With 16:19 left in the first period, 
senior defender Jackson Gilmore got 
UCSD on the board first, breaking the 
scoreless streak that lasted through-
out the Tritons’ game with the Aztecs. 
College of the Canyons answered back 
with a goal of their own and looked to 
take the lead on a breakaway, but junior 
goaltender Matt Hager preserved the 
tie with a solid save for the Tritons. 

After UCSD took a 2-1 lead with 
seven minutes left to play in the first 
period, the Cougars racked up two 
quick goals to take a 3-2 lead and 
looked to add on at the end of the 
period. However, UCSD put together 
two timely stops in the last minute of 
the first to close out the period trailing

MEN’S GOLF — After a nearly 
three-month hiatus from competi-
tion, the UCSD men’s golf team fin-
ished fifth in the second annual San 
Diego Collegiate Classic on Jan. 26.

The Tritons posted a team total of 
635, 30 strokes behind overall win-
ner University of San Diego. Junior 
Raj Samra, senior Ryan Bailey and 
junior Austin Alfonso all fired 161 
two-round totals to lead for UCSD.

While this was not the start they 
wanted, head coach Mike Wydra was 
happy his team gained the experi-
ence against Division-I schools.

“That kind of competition will 
serve us well in our next tourna-
ment,” he said.  

In a battle royale of sorts among 
the collegiate golf teams of San Diego, 
Samra said it was a great opportunity 
to feel out the local competition.

“On a better day, we can compete 
with them,” Samra said. “I’ve known 
SDSU and USD have good teams, 
and it was fun to see how we com-
pared.”

Without the luxury of a practice 
round, the Tritons struggled on the 
greens in round one. Alfonso led the 
Tritons with a 6-over 78 while Samra 
fired an uncharacteristically high 87.
