Sixth College 
Curriculum 
Approved 
Academic Senate 
fi nal izes new college'S 
general education 
By REBECCA WOOD 
Senior Staff Wnter 

The Academic Senate voted unanimously 
to approve the Committee on Education 
Policy's reco mmendatio n for the Sixth 
College Detailed Academic Plan in its tinal 
meeting of the year. 

The Sixth Colkg~ Steering Committe.:. 
which includes undergraduate student rep-
resentatives, submitted the plan. Gabride 
Wienhausen, provost of Sixth College, pre-
sented the plan at the meeting. 

Sixth Co llege's them e, "Culture. Art and 
Technology," is also the name of the 
required general education core sequcnCL 
des igned to embrace the exploration of 
interactions among th e three. The CAT 
sequence is highly interdiscipli nary and 
integrates learning in arts and humanitil's, 
social sciences, and science and t:nginen-
ing. 

The general educat ion requirements 
also emphasizl' the mission of the Ilew col-
lege. 

"Sixth College will help students to ~l'l' 
their own and other culture not as glvcns, 
but as products of this synergistic interpi;l), 
amongst art. technology and human adapta-
tion ," the plan states. 

In addition to the CAT sequence, stu-
dents will be required to take an associated 
course in computer literacy in their tir~t 
quarter. 

Students will also receive Illtellsive 
instruction in composition and information 
li teracy in the second and third quarters, 
breadth requirements, and an upper-division 
practicum with .In adjunct communication 
class. 

General education requirements ilt Sixth 
College will be identical for all of its studl'nts

Scripps Student Makes Underwater Mouse 
New device will make ocean research easier and more cost-effective 
By MARGARET O'NEILL 
Staff Writer 

Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography professor Jules 
Jaffe and graduate student David 
Zawada recently completed the 
development of an underwater 
computer mouse. 

The mouse increases the con-
venience of underwater research. 
With the device, a diver does not 
need to surface to adjust settings 
on underwater cameras, which are 
often used in research. 

According to Jaffe, Zawada 
spawned the idea in May 1999, 
when he was working on his gradu-
ate thesis studying coral reefs in the 
Bahamas. The scientific-grade digi-
tal camera that the scientists were 

using came with software provided 
by the manufacturer. This software 
required a mouse. Because a typical 
computer mouse would not work 
underwater. Zawada decided that 
an underwater mouse would make 
his research easier. 

Jaffe headed the development of 
the device. In the spring of2000, he 
purchased a typical optical mouse, 
The mouse was put into a water-
proof box with an optically trans-
parent port. A mouse pad was used 
underwater for movement. 

The optical mouse works in 
this si tuation because "light ca n 
go through the water: Jaffe said. 

The duo took the mouse back 
to the Bahamas in May of 2000 
and discovered that it worked. 

"IThe mousel provided great 

convenience to us at minim al 
expense," Jaffe sa id. 

Ja ffe sa id that he found the 
invention interesting for three rea-
sons. 

"One. it's cute: he said. 
jaffe's second reason was that 

the device was cost effective. 
"The most interesting thing 

was th at it was cheap and it 
worked," he said. 

Most of the devices he develops 
at Scripps are expensive and time 
consumi ng, as they are built from 
scratch. The main component of 
the underwater mouse, the optical 
mouse, was already made and only 
cost $17, he said. 

Jaffe said the third thing he 
found interesting was "the idea 
that people would want to interact 

wi th computers underwater, and 
now there 's a new way to do that." 

According to Jaffe, a company 
in Australia is making a "wet COIll-
puter" to be used underwater. This 
computer does not, however, usc d 
mouse. It has a few buttons to 
control Illovement onscn:cll. 

Jaffe feel that thc mousl' is ,Ill 
easier way of using a cOlliputer. 

"A mouse: gives you more CO Il -
trol," he said. 

The mouse is currently ,lwalt-
ing a potential patent. 

"We filed J patent disci surl' 
with the university," Jaffe said. 
"But Iuq doesn't patent things 
anymore without an mvestor sit-
ting around saying, 'We'll pay for 
it.' Also, r don't think there's too 
much of a market for this."

UCSD and Reproductive 
Partners to Combine 

UCSD School of Medicine reproductive 
endocrinologists and physicians of Reproductive 
Partners Medical Group in La Jolla have jOined to 
form Reproductive PartnersÂ·UCSD Regional 
Fertility Center. 

RPMG is an internationally renowned fertility 
center with five offices in Southern California . 
RPMG 's pregnancy success rates are well above 
the national average. 

UCSD's reproductive endocrinology division 
has received international acclaim for its patient 
care and research, and was designated a Center 
for Reproductive Research by the National 
Institutes of Child Health and Human 
Development. 

The RP-UCSD Regional Fertility Center will 
operate out of the Scripps/XiMed building in La 
Jolla. Patients will benefit from.a comprehensive 
approach to care, including in complex situa-

tions that may require advanced services like 
invitro fertilization and embryo transfer. 

Brain's Visual Cortex May Not 
Give the Whole Picture 

Research by scientists at UCSD and the 
University of Minnesota has shown that neurons 
in the visual cortex, an area of the brain which 
processes visual information, can respond to 
patterns of lines too fine for subjects to resolve. 

The study revealed that some types of visual 
information not consciously perceived are in fact 
closer to the brain 's center of consciousness 
than previously thought. 

The scientists' work was published in the 
May 24 issue of Nature. . 

A person with normal vision can perceive pat-
terns of lines up to a certain point, but when the 
spacing of lines becomes too fine, the person 
perceives 'a : uniform blur. Previously, vision 
researchers thought this was due to optical blur-
ring, a failure of the retina to resolve the lines. 

Now, at least some of that blurring has been 
shown to occur in the visual cortex, which lies 
in the rear of the cerebrum. The blurring of lines 
appears to be due to processes inside the visual 
cortex that prevent some informat ion from other 
cortical areas and consciousness. 

Student Foundation Chooses 
Student for S.cholarshlps 

For the first time , student from UCSD's 
Student Foundation have selected six communiÂ· 
ty scholars to receive $1,000 scholarships. 

The criteria for selection included being a cur-
rent high school senior with plans to attend 
UCSD this fall. In addition to this, recipients 
were selected on the basis of community ser-
vice, academics, a written essay and extra-cir-
riculars. 

Half of the scholarships were funded by money 
from the Student Foundation's own investment 
portfOlio, which totals approximately $100,000. 
The UCSD Student Foundat ion sc holarships 
enabled another three scholarships through 
matching donations from Chancellor Robert 
Dynes' 5K Run/Walk for Scholars earlier this year.

Plan: 
Sixth College's education will 
emphasize computer literacy 

. Continued from PICe 1 
and will include 17 to 18 courses totaling 68 
to 72 units. 

An education from Sixth College will 
emphasize computer literacy and will 
include learning inside and outside the 
classroom. 

Though the CEP motion was approved, 
there were some concerns raised during the 
meeting. 

Communications professor Chandra 
Mukerji addressed the concern that Sixth 
College curriculum should include a course 
that shows how technology is not always 
benign. 

"There is not enough attention to the 
character of technology," Mukerji said . 
"Students need to know about the power of 
technology. " 

Muketji cited military technology as an 
example of this. 

Acting organizer of the Sixth College core 

Cql.legiate: 
Teenage brides are more likely 
to divyrce within 10 years 
Continued from ...,e 1 
Census Bureau. 

People are divorcing faster than they can 
marry. The champions leading the divorce 
trend are couples between the ages of 18 to 
25. 

According to a government study, teenage 
brides are more likely to divorce within 10 
years of marriage than older women. 

As a whole, the number of people divorc-
ing has quadrupled since 1970, from 4.3 mil-
lion to 18.3 million in 1996. 

sequence, John Marino, added that he agreed 
with Mukerji and that proposed courses 
such as "Leonardo and Machiavelli" would 
discuss the effects of politics and power on 
technology. -

Tho required "Art Making" classes were 
also a concern. One speaker said that the 
requirements should be loosened and that 
taking such courses, because they are only 10 
weeks in length, was simply "dabbling" in the 
arts. 

Another concern was the absence of a 
foreign language requirement. Studying a 
foreign language will be encouraged but 
not required in an effort to make Sixth 
College more accessib le to transfer stu-
dents. 

"You can't have everything," said Muir 
College Provost Patrick Ledden. 

He also lauded the accomplishments of 
the Sixth College Steering Committee. 

"The Sixth College has done a terrific job 
of carving out its niche," Ledden said. 

The Sixth College will admit its first stu-
dents in fall 2002. 

Sixth College is the first new undergradu-
~te college at UCSD since Eleanor Roosevelt 
College was established in 1988. 

"I know of a few people who've gotten 
married right out of college, but I can't 
imagine 'being ready for that kind of com-
mitment in a few years," said Florida State 
University junior Bianca Parker. "Twenty-
one? I don't know any 21-year-olds who 
are that responsible: 

The fact that people many young is noth-
ing new. 

Studies show that the number of people 
marrying between the ages of 18 and 25 has 
actually decreased over time, while the average 
age of marriage has increased. 

"Marriage was more of a way of life when 
I was growing up," said professional Brenda 
Joyce. "Being 26 years old and getting mar-

Executive Budget 
Changes Beneficial 
to Student Body 

The UCSD Guardian applauds the A.S. 
Council 's approval of the 2001-2002 execu-
tive budget last week and agrees with most 
of the changes made in the new budget'S 
allocations. 

Primarily, the Guardian applauds A.S. 
President Jeff Dodge for spearheading the 
effort to eliminate the line- item allocation 
given to the Committee for World Democ-
racy in past budgets. 

Alth ough th e CWO's events bring 
essent ial messages of global awareness to 
UCS D, the Guardian acknowledges that it 
is still only one of hundreds of student 
organ iza tions and does not deserve the 
guaranteed, fixed funding sent irs way by 
past budgets. 

Forcing the CWO to annually apply for 
funding through the Student Organization 
Funding Allocation Board , as all other stu-
dent organizations must do, will eliminate 
the unfair financial advantage that the line-
item allocation gave to the CWO over other 
student groups. 

The decision to almost double the 
amount of money set aside for Fall Fest is 
another laudable change included in the 
2001-2002 executive budget. The recent 
success of the Sun God Festival proved that 
the A.S. programming office is capable of 
organizing well-rounded, lively events in 
spite of how tame this campus typically may 
be. 

The increase in Fall Fest funding is also 
a smart move, considering that bands tra-
ditionally tour in fa ll or spring. This way, 
there is double the chance that there will 
be at least one great concert at UCSD next 
year. 

Increasing the FallFest funds from 
$35,000 to $70,000 (keep in mind that the 
Sun God Festival, in comparison, receives 
$75,000) will hopefully boost the program-
ming office's ability to reel in . top-notch 
touring acts for its first major event of the 
academic year. 

Further, using the new funds to put 
together an impressive Fa ll Fest concert 
could set the mood for an alive and involved 
student body for the rest of the year. 

Finally, although the A.S. Council also 
deserves praise for passing the executive 
budget in record time - the process took 
on ly 11 minutes according to A.S. Vice 
President Internal Jenn Brown - this fact 
nonetheless evokes some concern. 

Remember that the Unity slate swept AS 
Council elections last quarter, and perhaps 
the speed wi th which this budget was rati -
fied proves that this council lacks a diversi-
ty f viewpoints. 

While diversity could bring legislative 
gridlock, which certainly would be equally 
detrimental to the students represented by 
the A.S. Council , passing a $1,133,400 bud-
get in 11 minutes can only indicate one 
thing: The Unity candidates who now hold 
office will get a lot done this year, but maybe 
only because they are not faced with 
empowered opposition and viewpoints 
from other council members.

Senator's Decision to Switch Party 
Makes Political History 

James Jeffords, a 27-year veteran Republican congressman, raises eyebrows 
in the nation with his bold and controversial exit from the GOP 

By AUSON NORRIS 
Senior Staff Writer 

Sen. James Jeffords' unorthodox deci-
sion to drop his loyalty to the Republican 
Party and jump on the independent 
bandwagon has understandably brought 
major heat from GOP leaders. 

Such a move is practically unheard of 
in the American two-party regime, which 
constantly reinforces party loyalty, and 
even those who despise politics should 
recognize the brilliance of this moment 
in American political history. 

Jeffords, until this month , was a 27-
year veteran Republican congressman 
whose moderate ideology has historical-
ly shone through the party label he wore. 
These moderate legislative goals have 
always distinguished him from other 
Republicans and inspired his recent 
move. 

For example, the Vermont senator has 
been devoted to using legislative means 
to meet the needs of special education . 
Although it is not fair to argue that 
Republicans are unconcerned with these 
needs, it is understandable that Jeffords 
would be prompted to aba ndon the 
Republicans if this is his true purpose in 
politics - just consider the assertion 
made by Sen. Phil Gramm, a Republican 
from Texas: "Special education is not a 
Republican issue." 

Instead of criticizing Jeffords for skip-
ping out on the Republican Party, we 
should be impressed that he chose to 
leave a party whose members criticize the 
causes that he has always advocated. The 
switch, ult imately, points to Jeffords' loy-
alty to his goals and ideology, rather than 
to a traditional party label. 

What makes Jeffords ' move such a 
hot topic, however, is not the decision 
itself; rather it is the political climate in 
which it was made. The Senate was deli-
cately balanced this year, with 50 
Democrats battling 50 Republicans 
before Jeffords' decision. 

Now, the scales have been slightly 
tipped, with 50 Democrats facing off 
against 49 RepUblicans, and Jeffords sits 
squarely iii between as the only indepen-

dent. 
The even split that previously existed 

and the legislative gridlock that it may 
have brought with it are gone. The 
Democrats will undoubtedly make good 
use of their slight, yet monumental, one-
vote lead over the Republicans. 

A valid concern about Jeffords' switch 
is that it could be motivated purely by elec-
toral interests. In other words, it could be 
that his constituents are increasingly 
returning moderate, independent results 
in polls and he is simply worried about 
being ousted by an independent candidate 
the next time his seat is up for a vote. 

If this is his motive, Jeffords could 
continue to defect to the Republican side 
of most issues on the Senate floor even 
though he has symbolically removed 
himself from that party. This would 

Unless Jeffords has been 
asleep in the back row all 
these years, he undoubtedly 
comprehends the magnitude 
of his choice on national 
policies, which indicates that Â· 
he is motivated by more than 
just the opportunity for one 
more turn in Congress. 
mai ntain the voting balance in the Sen-
ate. making his switch an empty gesture 
that deserves little recognition, and mak-
ing it more a media spectacle than a 
noteworthy moment in American politi-
cal history. 

However, Jeffords' move ultimately 
deserves more credit than this. It is pos-
sible that his motivations are based on 
electoral politics, but one must reason 
that a lifelong Congressman will not take 
lightly the Senate's tight balance between 
Democrats and Republicans. Unless Jef-
fords has been asleep in the back row all 
these years, he comprehends the effect of 
his choice on national policies, which 

indicates that he is motivated by more 
than just the opportunity for one more 
turn in Congress. 

Furthermore, the political backlash 
created by his decision has been wide-
spread, and it is illogical to assume that 
he would open himself to such criticisms 
unless motivated by something more 
than another six years of Senate service 
during which he would undoubtedly still 
receive icy treatment from Republicans 
in Congress. 

The greater lesson of Jeffords' 
moment in the limelight is twofold. First, 
consider the media attention given to his 
leap - while widespread coverage in 
Vermont would be understandable, this 
issue is touching all types and branches 
of media. Such in-depth coverage should 
indicate to any nonbelievers that this is 
in fact an important political moment. 

Second, the reason this event is being 
portrayed as important and 'newsworthy 
is the unique characteristics of America's 
current political machine. 

The Senate's former 50-50 balance is 
evidence of the increasi ngly centrist 
mentality of voters. As more candidates 
move toward the "middle of the road" on 

. the campaign trail in an effort to accom-
modate centrist voters, there will be 
fewer instances of one-party dominance 
in Congress. In such an environment, 
losing even one politician to the other 
side has new importance and new effects 
on a party's legislative strength . 

Ultimately, Jeffords choice is com-
mendable in that it sets aside the tradi-
tional party loyalty mentality that domi-
nates American politics. 

In fact, the former 50-50 balance in 
the Senate prompts acknowledgment 
that the American electorate is perhaps 
doing away with these loyalties as well. If 
so, Jeffords ' decision is even more 
praiseworthy, as it represents one politi-
cian's effort to stay aligned with those he 
represents. 

One can only hope that this effort is 
not motivated purely bi electoral inter-
ests, but that it reflects Jefford's desire to 
pursue the legislative solutions that he 
promised to constituents.

Labels Strip' Identity 
From Individuals 

PARISA BAHARIAN 

D o you ever feel the need to break free from the mold of conformity and 
unoriginality? Do you ever get 
sick of people being so quick to 
label or fit you into a category? 

Well , I've had it. Enough is 
enough . It 's time to deconstruct 
the labels that have been assigned 
to me. 

Bush does not make me a liber-
al. 

It 's almost ironic, because at 
the time I wrOte that article, on 
paper I was still a r.egistered 
Republican. But I am not a con-
servative nor a Republica n. I am 
not a liberal nor a Democrat. 

or do I associate myself with 
the Independent Party or Green 
Party. 

I am me. And those conve-
nient , all -purpose labels cannot 
accurately describe what I 
believe. r 

I have come to realize that 
our society has become label-

happy. 
It's high time 

that this insidious 
societal disease of 
labeling and clas-
sifying people 
based on 
assumptions was 
exposed. 

As a writer, I 
have encoun-
tere.d the frus-
trating phenom-
enon of people 
judging me sole-
ly on what I 
write, taking it 
upon themselves 
to label me with 
certain inaccu-
rate pol itical 
leanings. 

I have come to 
realize that our 
society has become 
label-happy. Rather 
than take the time 
to get to know 
people ... many 
find it easier to 
label one another, 

Rather than

For instance, 

people automatically assume th~t 
because I have written aga inst

I am an "evil liberal." 

Wrong. 
Another example is that peo-

ple automatically assume that, 
beca use I wrote about the mis-
conception of free speech and 
related a time when I had battled 
against the closed minds of so-
called open-minded liberal class-

"He's black and lives in the

Don't tell me that some of 
those labels don't immediately

people must be like - there are 
stigma attached to each. 

I could list hundreds of labels 
and assumptions used every day

characteristics of a person that 
are important to know.

Year Proves Fun, Unpredictable 
By MARGARET O'NEILL 
Staff Writer 

Last summer, as I counted 
down the days untilll1lol'ed out, I 
saw college merely as an escape, as 
a way of getting out of my boring 
town and gaining some indepen-
dence. It seemed simp!.? to 11K I 
never imagined what tl1l5 lirst ycar 
of college wou ld hold. 

Now, the year is nearly over. I 
am almost one-q uarter of the way . 
through co llege. I used to hear 
cl iche references to high school as 
the "best years of your life," but I 
really think college will be my best 
years. Though I faced some of the 
toughest stuff fathomable this 
year, I felt fo r the first time like I 
was li ving my own life. 

Livi ng in the residence halls was 
defi nitely an experience. It is some-

thing I'm ready to be done with. but 
something I'll always appreciate. 

Never again will my dorrnmates 
or I have the opportunity to get to 
know so many people so fast and so 
well. Staying up until sunrise doing 
absolutely noth ing substantial was 
fun. I enjoyed all the time hanging

mates develop all sorts of different 
lifestyles now that they're on their 
own. 

While we had moments I did 
not appreciate, I loved my suite and 
the diversity of personalities in it.

I've had so many different

think I' ll keep through all of col-

last long at all. I've got tons of

I've kept that viewpoint until now, 
In general, probably because this is

I've found a few bad apples,

Alcohol 
Ban Not 
the Right 
Remedy 
By JESSICA SCHEPPMANN 
Senior Staff Writer 

Continuing Am erica 's fi ne tra-
dition of repression and den ial, 
the Mission Beach town coun ci l 
successfully petitioned the ci ty 
governm ent for a temporary ban 
on drinking on the beaches, las t-
ing th rough the summer, A coun-
terpe tition signed by over 50 ,000 
registered vo ters was fi led 
Wednesday by people who do not 
want the beach drinking ba n to go 
into effect. 

Now, it 's not like the home-
owners in Pacific Beach and Mis-
sion Beach are without grounds in 
their desire to see so me restrain t 
on the excess drinking in this 
area, Al though these an-as con-
ta in less than 5 percent of the 
city's population, they account fo r 
more than 34 percent of all alco-
hol-related cri mes in the ~ntire 
city of San Diego, according to 
Michael Davis of the San Diego 
Police Depart ment 's vice un it. 

Additionally, an oversa tura tion 
of liquor licenses, a reprrcus,ion 
of attempts to revi talize the area, 
have made alcohol a prime source 
of revenue for busi ness owners, 
Howeve r, wi th the ba rs has come 
a vast increase in alcohol-related 
crime, 

Ten yea rs ago, th e Pacific 
Beach/Garnet area was suff,'ri ng 
from a loss in reve nue, City offi-
cials reacted by relax ing stringent 
standards for the issue of liquor 
lice nses, T hiS oversaturatio n , 
however, made Pac ific Beach a 
well -known drinking area, much 
like th e: Gaslamp distric t. 

The oversa lU ration of liquor 
licenses brought Wilh it more 
money from tOUrists, students and 
locals, but homeow nl'l's in th e

illS mean t .I n IIl crCdse in cri me: 
and vagrancy, which ultim,ltcly

According III il recen t dnirle In 
TIr., Reader, the d,'ba ~l' bods d" wn 
to the res idents of Paclt1o: Bedch 
cOll1 mg to terms with their own 
identity, 1\ number of diffe (' nt 
f,ICtiOl;S, from older residents II ho 
resent the presence of the bars, to 
students and )'oungcr rl's idt,l1ts 
who want nothing more than LO 
pa rt)', arc ca ught in a deadlock 
over what shou ld be done, 

There has been a reprieve of 
,ortS, how,'ver, Ci ty officials 
announco:d, right before: the ban 
was imposed , that gr ups of 20 r 
more could pay a small fee for tne 
right to assemble and dri nk on 
the beach, Th is way, by obtaining 
a license:, the drinking could con-
tinue, mon itored by city police, 

What it really boils down to is 
making people happy, If you look 
at the issue, it's not about good 
ve rsus bad, but rather an attempt 
to placate puritanica l advoca tes 
who would attempt to temper any 
hedon istic behavior on the pa rt of 
the younger generat ion, 

Were th is an issue of good ver-
sus evil, city oftlcials wou ld stop 
drinking in publ~ altogether, It is 
si mply an attempt to impose 
repressi ve ideologica l behaviors 
on those who do not have the 
resources to fight it. 

Government officia ls in th e 
United States have a long his tory 
of attempting to regulate and ba n 
drugs and alcohol. Everyth ing 
from prohibition to Ronald Rea-
gan 's war on drugs duri ng th e 
1980 have proven that increased

the proliferation of illegal activi ty 
and unnecessary criminal prose-

Continued from page 5 
a person solely on these assump-
tions is discriminating and unfair, 

How would you liked to be 
judged on one random aspect of 
yourself? 

Or how about single labels 
such as, "He's gay:' or "She's 
Mormon"? 

Some people carelessly say 
such th ings as if those labels 
should explai n everything abo ut 
a person - when they most def-
initely ca nnot. Why is it tha t we

based on thei r appearance, socia l

become so obsessed with label-

I believe the answer is that it 
is so much easier to use a label 
to classify and categorize instead 
of taki ng the time to find out 
who tha t person rea lly is, 

Yet 'this is getting out of con-
trol. 

Ever notice when watching 
C N, or C-S PAN that without 
fail every politi cian is immediately 
identified by party classification? 
It's almost as if they don't trust 
you to make your own judgment 
of the tru th or the va lidity of a 
political person's point of view 
wi thout knowing from the onset 
what party tha t person is associat-
ed with , 

I believe that this automatic 
labeling scheme is a clever way tQ 
keep the pa rty fa ithful brain-
washed - to keep us from ques-
tion ing what our political loya list 
says, 

Party labeling inspires bl ind 
loyalty and instant dislike and 
hatred toward the opposi tion, It 

doesn't matter what the truth is 
or who is righ t; all that ma tters is 
ensuring that the all -important 
label is there so that the conserv-
ati ve or liberal flock does not stray 
from party lines, 

I am absolute ly convinced 
that labeling is used to divide us 
and to inci te feelings of hatred 
or dislike based on those who do 
not have the same labels, 

I have seen people face each 
other for the fi rst time and hate 
each other based solely on their 
pa rty affiliation, I have seen peo-
ple instantly hate politicians 
so lely beca use of their party 
labe ls, 

Labeling does not bring our 
soc iety toge th er, instead it 
emphasizes old hatreds and dis-
cri minations and serves only to 
divide us, 

What are you? A Democrat or 
Republican? What arc you? Per-
sian, German or Caucasian? If 
you don 't choose, then you're a 
wishy-washy person who is inde-
cisive and stupid! 

I give up, I will not adopt those 
divisive, discriminating and 
demeaning labels, I will not con-
fo rm, Above all , I wi ll not label 
myself, Sorry to disappoint those 
who are label- happy, but you 
won't be able to shove me into a 
box and then slap a label on me as 
if tha t is all th at it takes to 
describe me, 

There is no label that will pre-
dict my behavior or beliefs on any 
issue, Expect contradictions and 
confusion, [ urge my fellow Stu-
dents not to worry so much about 
categorizing. labeling and fitting 
every person into a neat li ttle pack-
age. Take the time to look deeper 
beneath the surfa,ce, Take the 
plunge and rise above the quick-
sand of conformity, Above all , 
question, question, question, 

Dare to be different, Dare to 
be a nonconformist , Dare to be 
yourself,

Study Identifies Teen Pregnancy 
Prevention Programs That Work 

BALTIMORE - Shannon 
White used to assume she would 
become a teen mother, like her big 
sister. But at 17, after three years 
in an experimental after-school 
program aimed at preventing teen 
pregnancy, her expectation~ are 
quite different. "This program 
changed me," she said . "I have a 
life. I have things to do. I'm going 
to be a nurse. Will I have babies? 
No time soon: 

The program, created by Dr. 
Michael Carrera at the Children's 
Aid Society, offers not just tradi-
tional sex educa tion, but tutoring, 
SAT preparation, job skills, med-
ical and dental care, sports and 
creative arts. 

And in a field littered with 
good intentions, heavy doses of 
morality and scant evidence of 
results, the Carrera program is a 
sol id success: A three-year eva lua-
tion of its 12 si tes in poor neigh-
borhoods nationwide found par-
ti ci pants had one- th ird fewer 
pregna ncies, and births, than 

those in the control group. 
The Carrera program is singled 

out in a comprehensive report on 
the avai lable research on teen 
pregnancy programs, to be 
released Wednesday by the

of its 12 sites in poor 
neighborfwods 
nationwide found 
participants had one-
third fewer pregnancies, 
and births, than tfwse in 
the control group. 
National Campaign to Prevent 
Teen Pregnancy, a nonprofit. non-
partisan group in Washington. 

The report finds several other 
models of teen pregnancy pro-
grams that also have had positive 
results. Studies of some sex and 
HIV education programs found 

that participants delayed sex, 
increased their use of contracep-
tion and reduced their number of 
sexual partners, for a t least 31 
months. 

"One important finding is that 
sex and HIV education do not 
hasten sexual activity, that educa-
tion about abstinence and contra-
ception are compatible, and not in 
conflict with each other: said 
Doug Kirby, the author of the 
report. "We also found that mak-
ing condoms available does not 
increase sexual behavior. These 
are issues that a lot of people have 
worried about." 

The 1996 welfare reform law 
included $85 million a year in fed-
eral and state funding available, 
for five years, for abstinence-only 
programs that do not teach con-
traception. A federally sponsored 
evaluation of those programs is 
underway.

Supreme Court Rules Di~bled Golfer 
Can Ride in Cart on PGA Tour 

WASHINGTO The 
Supreme Court ruled decisively 
on Tuesday that Casey Martin, 
the disabled golfer who has been 
battling the PGA Tour over its 
walking rule for the past four 
years, has the legal right to ride 
in a golf cart during tournament 
play. 

The 7-2 decision rejected the 
tour's argument that making an 
exception for Martin, a former 
COllegia te champion who has a 
degenerative condition in his right 
kg, would fundamentally alter the 
nature of championship golf. The 
ruling upheld a decision last year 
by the U.S. Appeals Court in San 
Francisco. 

The Americans with 
Disabilities Act, under which 
Martin sued the PGA Tour in 
1997, requires operators of golf 
courses and other "public accom-
modations" to make "reasonable 
modifications" for people with 
disabilities unless the changes 
would "fundamentally alter the 
nature" of the activity. 

The court Tuesday found that 
therc was nothing fundamental 
abou t th e requ ircment that the 
five or so miles around a golf 
course bc navigated on foot.

prisingly, did not refer to golf 
carts. 

Stevens said the PGA Tour's 
walking rule, which applies only 
at top-level tournaments, was "at 
best peripheral" and "not an 
indispensable feature" of golf at 
any level. "Thus it might be 
waived in individual cases with-
out working a fundamental alter-
ation," he said. 

The court stressed the need to 

millions of newly laid-off workers 
to keep their upper lips stiff and

"social contradictions: 

These days, Lei Feng's spirit 
has reportedly met one of the 
most demanding challenges yet. 

Over the last year, the army 
ncwspaper said, about 500 "deeply 
poisoned" followers of the banned 
spi ritual sect were taken from 
their nearby "re-education 
through labor" camp to visit the 
Lei Feng Memorial hall in the 
northeast province of Liaoning. 
Guided by troops from Lei Feng's 
very own former unit, these 
strayed citizens "increased the 
pace of their mental transforma-
tion and shortened the time it 
took to return to their families and 
society." 

As every child has been taught 
for the last 38 years, Lei Feng was 

evaluate each case on an individ-
ual basis. 

Only those for whom walking 
was " beyond their capacity." and 
not simply uncomfortable or diffi-
cult, would qualify for an exemp-
tion, Stevens said. 

Martin, who turns 29 on 
Saturday, has a progressive circu-
latory disorder called Klippel-
Trenaunay-Weber syndrome, 
which has caused his right leg to 
atrophy; walking is not only very 
painful but also poses the risk of 
hemorrhage, blood clots, and frac-
tures of his weakened bones. 

His victories against the PGA 
Tour in the lower courts have 
enabled him to use a cart for the 
last three years at various profes-
sional levels. 

The PGA Tour commissioner, 
Tim Finchem, said in a statement 
Tuesday from Ponte Vedra 
Beach, Fla. , that the tour "will 
continue to welcome Casey as a 
member and a competitor." He 
said the PGA would study the 
impact of the ruling on its "regu-
lations and rules of competi-
tion."

local Communist Party branch. 

He served nobly in the mili-
tary until the fateful , rainy day in 
1962 when a truck accidentally 
knocked over a telephone pole, 
which hit him in the head and 
killed him. 

From his astounding diary 
and comrades' testimonials, the 
propaganda mavens soon 
announced, Lei Feng was clearly 
a Commu nist icon. Once Mao 
gave his endorsement, Lei Feng 
became a fixture of party exhor-
tations, surviving right through 
China's recent decades of daz-

change, even as the public 
became more worldly and Lei 
became a standi ng joke.

Germans' Debate Over 
Bioethics Colored by Past 

BERLIN - A debate clouded 
by memories of tre Third Reich 
has erupted in Germany over the 
ethics of research in biotechnolo-
gy and particularly the use of 
embryos for genetic inquiry and 
diagnosis. 

The discussion has pitted 
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder 
against President Johannes Rau, 
whose role is generally ceremonial 
but assumes significance in such 
ethical matters, where the presi-
dency is expected to act as a sort of 
moral arbiter. 

Schroeder, a pragmatic Social 
Democrat, argues that gene tech-
nology produces new drugs and 

attenuate a number of taboos 
prevalent because of the Nazi 
past. He speaks freely of German 
power, interests and ambitions, 
both political and economic, in a 
way that was unthinkable even a 
decade ago. 

In extending this policy to the 
field of genetic research and engi-
neering, he has evidently angered 
Rau, another Social Democrat. 

Using unusua lly vehement 
language for a German president, 
Rau said last week that "eugenics, 
euthanasia and selection are 
labels wh ich are linked to bad 
memories in Germany." 
Appearing to rebuff the chancel-

argument that President of Germany rently banned

Schroeder has said human dignity 
was linked above all to "access to 
gainful employment" and that the 
economic possibilities of biotech-
nology were too vast to ignore. 

Such themes have been debated 
in the United States and in many 
European countries. But they are 
particularly sensitive in Germany 
because of the extensive euthanasia 
program and other Nazi medical 
experiments aimed at fashioning a 
master Aryan race.

longer-term solutions: conserva-
tion, new energy technologies and 
speeded efforts to approve and 
build power plants. 

The real argument between the 
president and the governor is over 
who should pay for soaring energy 
prices here and the botched dereg-
ulation of the electricity market -
the state's consumers, generators 
or the utilities. 

To bolster his case and answer 
Bush's economic critique, Davis 

released a letter 
Tuesday written by 
10 leading econo-
mists, urging Bush 
to strike a middle

opposition to price caps. 
"We win not take any action 

that makes California's problems 
worse, and that's why I oppose 
price caps," Bush told a largely 
sympathetic audience at a lun -
cheon of the World Affairs Council 
here. 

"Price ca ps do nothing to 
reduce demand and they do 
nothing to increase supply: Bush 
said. "This is not only my admin-
istration's position , this was the 
position of the prior administra-
tion." 

Bush instead emphasized 

Karl Rove, the president's chief 
political adviser, said Bush was 
committed to stoppi ng any illegal 
price-gouging by energy s~pplier 
and bringin.g "price relief" to 
Californians by means other than 
price caps. 

But Davis ca lled some form of 
price controls "the big enchilada, 
and the thing that really matters 
above all else: adding that he and 
Bush remained far apart on the 
issue.

Watermelon Queen to Drop Big Melon 
Revelle student Seth Raphael wins pageant, wiLl participate in annual event 
By GEOFf DIETRICH 
Staff Writer 

Watermelons came alive last 
night at the annual Watermelon 
Queen Pageant held at the Plaza 
Cafe. The winner of the pageant 
will get to drop the watermelon in 
this year's annual Watermelon 
Drop, which will occur next Friday 
at Urey Hall. 

Three students vied for the 
opportunity to drop the water-
melon off Urey Hall, but Revelle 
freshman Seth Raphael won . 

"I think it 's wonderful : 
Raphael said. "It was a lot of fun: 

Raphael, who wore a skirt, and 
red face paint and a carved water-
melon on his head, dazzled the 
judges with his watermelon 
magic, dancing and immense 
knowledge of watermelon trivia. 

The other contestants, Britt 
Trozzi and Chalise Morgan, also 
dressed accordingly by wearing 
ei!he.r multiple melons or red and 
green clothing. 

Becoming the Watermelon 
Queen has been a goal fo r Trozzi. 

~It's my senior year; I decided 
I had to try: Trozzi said. "I've 
been telling everybody I'm going 
to be the Watermelon Queen." 

Although she did not win, she 
did score big points with the 
judges for karate chopping a 
watermelon. 

"My residents put me up to 
it: said Morgan, a Revelle resi-
dent adviser. "It's just for fun ." 

The three contestants were 
judged on the quality of their 
skits, overall style, costume, 
knowledge of watermelon trivia, 
and audience interaction and 
appeal. 

"It's to figure out who is going 

INTRODUCING ... 

to toss the watermelon, who is 
going to represent Revelle in this 
tradition: said Samantha Floyd, a 
past winner and one of this year's 
judges. 

The Revelle Programming 
Board sponsored the unique 
event, which entertained the many 
diners at Plaza Cafe. 

"It's a good, wholesome stress 
reliever for the end of the school 
year: said former Revelle student 
Rebecca Durham. "It's all part of 
the Revelle tradition." 

The pageant even attracted stu-
dents who had graduated from 
Revelle. 

"I think it's fun , I watch it every 
year: said Revelle graduate Jason 
Drogo. "This year has a very 
eccentric set." 

Not all of those. at the cafe 
found the event so exciting. 

"I like the spirit of it, but it does-
n't seem so popular among stu-
dents: said student Helen Chee. 

Revelle Dean Renee Barenette 
Terry, who was a judge, seemed 
pleased with the event. 

"I expected a large crowd, but 
nonetheless I think it was a very 
successful event, being an activi-
ty associated wi th tradition: she 
said. 

Raphael was excited about 
getting to drop the watermelon. 

"I've always been a watermel-
on fan: said Raphael, who also 
won $100, which will be used to 
buy the watermelon and help pay 
tui tion. 

The tradition began in 1965 
as a physics experiment by pro-
fessor Bob Swanson who asked 
his students to determine the ter-
minal velocity of a watermelon

According to the Web site, the 
number of people with some col-

But even with a more educated 
population, the trend to marry 
young is still present. So, why are 
people still marrying young? 
Opinions on th is campus are spe-

" It seems like most of the pres-

chances of meeting somcone after

being lonely for the rest of their 
lives in place of having a longer

Flesh: 
Neighborhood girls enter the 
escort business through one man 
Continued from page 10 
one of the girls that a party has been sched-
uled for the next night at 9 p.m .â¢ and that 
most of the people there will be officers from 
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms. 

After nine hours of sleep, one hour for 
breakfast, one hour with the baby, 30 min-
utes to get dressed, 10 minutes to smoke a 
joint and five minutes to mix the Tanqueray 
and OJ, the girls are ready to start their busi-
ness day. 

Sasha and Nalia are escorts, also called 
"adult entertainers" or "in-call masseuses." 
Living by their stage names, only a handful 
knOW'lhem by their actual given names. They 
dance. They mingle. They massage. And with 
the right face and a gracious tip, they will 
loan their bodies for one or twO hours, some-
times the whole night, to a client. 

At the ages of21 and 19, respectively. they 
have spent most, if not all, of their adult lives 
as escorts. Pride and shame are relative fac-
tors; survival becomes their mantra for life. 

Yet neither girl ever exhibits any need for 
sympathy or compassion. especially from 
each other. Both hope to retire in three 10 
fou years. but an uneasiness rests inside

the'm, wondering if they'll ever get to exhale. 
Consequently, it becomes easy to victimize 
the twO girls, and to view them as products of 
a broken home or society. 

In reality, their lives are a cocktail of glam-
our and isolation . They live and cry like rock 
stars, locked behind their seductive masks. 
As a result, they can only find solace with 
those in the same industry, those who see the 
world in the same black-and-white. pimp-
and-ho light. 

The following is an excerpt from a series 
of interviews with Sash a and Nalia that 
began at a .Denny's on Miramar Road and 
ended at a photo shoot in Del Mar. 

Both women have lived in San Diego 
their whole lives; in fact, they grew up in the 

. same neighborhood. Aware of each other. 
but never close friends, their paths did not 
truly cross until each inadvertently became 
involved with the same man. 

It was this same man that would impreg-
nate both women. Sasha had the baby, Nalia 
aborted hers. And it would be the same man 
who would convince them to stan escorting. 

In the end, his persuasion was more prac-
tical than romantic. Sasha had just complet-
ed adult school, while alia was supporting 
a family of 10 by working at Subway. He 
wanted both of them; he offered money, 
security and independence. But this anicle is 
not . bout him. nor about their nco-urban

12 HIATUS 

Flesh: 
Escorts selling sex is a 
major misconception 
Continued from page 11 
love triangle. It is about two girls 
who made a choice and the price 
they have paid. 

HOW WOULD YOU DEFINE YOUR 
" EMPLOYMENT?" 

sllsha: "Adult entertainer," 
because I love to come over to peo-
ple's houses and give them some 
company. And it's cool that 1 get 
paid !IaughsJ. 

HOW DID YOU GET STARTED? 
Nalia: I kn~w someone that 
work~d and she used to tell me sto-
ries about it and everything, but it 
wasn't until 1 met JherJ that 1 got 
into it. 

HOW OLD WERE YOU? 

Sasha: Well , he's the father of 
my child. We're not like boyfriend 
and gi rlfriend in the typical way, 
you know. On another level , we 
are ... he understands and 
respects, I understand and 
respect. 1 get out of line some-
times, but with what I do - I turn 
into a bitch lIaughsJ! 

Well, a female needs anent ion, 
you know, so when you don 't get 
that attention and you don 't get 
that attention for a minute, it's 
kinda like, "Either you love me or 
I'm gonna go somewhere else: 

DEFINE THE SYSTEM. 
Nalia: The particular agency I'm 

at, they're actually pimpin' me 
instead of me trying to pimp other 
people. I mean, they 're making it 
really hard for me to make my 
money, because they charge a good 
$225 right off the bat. And out of 
that $225, I'll get maybe 40 per-
cent . 

The UCSD Guardian Thursday, May 31, 2001 

Nalia: When she was working, 1 
was 15. Yeah, and she was 19. But 1 
knew her through somebody else. 
Like, it was my friend's boyfriend's 
girlfriend. She lived in the same 
house as my neighbor. She use to 
tell me stories - like some guy 
wanted to lick shit and stuff off her 
shoes Jgiggles J. It was rea lly gross. 
She would tell me some freaky sto-
ries, and at first I was a little dis-
couraged, but then I realized it was 
safe enough. 

It wasn 't always like that, the 
reason being because 1 was at this 
other agency that I was doing real 
good at, but I got into trouble with 
my lOs and all kinds of other stuff. 
It's just a real long story and 1 
couldn't work there a little bit. 

When 1 got back and had every-
thing situated, the lady who was 
giving me work before decided she 
didn't want to give me work any-
more, and then, on top of that, 
she's going to tell people from 
other agencies that 1 steal calls, that 
I'm not a good worker, and then 
she's gonna tell family members 
that I'm the reason that they don 't 
get calls [laughsJ. 

Brian Moghadam/ Guarcillfl 
U.,.: Anony"!ity is the esan1$ best friend. Escorts like sas~a anti. Nalia use stage names in arder ta protect their identity from would-be 
stalkm. All dumtt are also put GIl a pt.7mllnent database WIth their address and plume number in case aJ an emergency. 

WHY DO YOU DO IT? 
sasha: At first 1 started for the 

money, but now, well , it's still for 
the money, but it's exciting, actual-
ly. You get to meet all kinds of peo-
ple. And you get to meet the side 
they don 't share with people -
their secret side. Like somebody 
might be cool up front, but you get 
them in a room alone and they like 
to get freaky. 1 like that . 

HOW DO YOU MAKE TIME FOR 
LOVE? 

Sasha: I can make time for it , but 
nobody would understand. And 
ever since I had my child, I really 
can't have other relationships with 
other people. 

LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FATHER 
OF YOUR CHILD. 

susha: Let's not. 

WHAT IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP 
WITH HIM? 

THI UCID 

0,Â·02 c!P.'!~ ~o DENT IG~m 

Yes, and 1 never spoke to this 
lady that way. 1 don 't like her at all. 
She killed me real bad. 

ARE THESE AGENCIES 
PRIVATELY OWNED? 

Sash a: They're usually privately 
owned, a lot of the times by 
women . 

HOW MANY GIRLS USUAUY 
WORK AT AN AGENCY? 

No/ia: It va ries, really. You ca n 
get anywhere from 20 girls or 
more. But then you can get some 
wi th 15 or less. But they really don 't 
let the girls know about each other, 
because if there's only 10 girls 
working at the agency and you're 
never getting calls, then the gi rl will 
wonder why she's not getting 
enough work. 

Actually the people who run 

these businesses kind of get a little 
more personal than just having it 
just business. Like the people they 
hire, they don 't tell them to just 
keep it business and not let their 
personal feelings get in the way 
with what you're doing. 

A lot of receptionists won't give 
you calls if you don't tip them. And 
hey, 1 understand you 're making 
your money - whatever, whatever 
- but that's your job. 

I don 't always get tips when I go 
out. Sometimes I have to deal with 
the nastiest people, and I get noth-
ing out of it. Sure, 1 get my $60 for 
showing up, but $60 doesn't even 
pay my phone bill [laughsJ. I got 
bills to pay for every day and a 
lifestyle to keep up. 

HOW DOES A JOHN SOLICIT YOU 
FOR SEX, SASHA? 

sasha: 1 actually don't do that 
ever unless 1 get personal enjoy-
ment out of it, like if the guy is cute 
or if he has a big, nice dick !laughsJ. 
So they'll ask and I'll say either yes 
or no. They usually ask if you 're 
"full service." 

WHAT DO YOU USUALLY SAY? 
Sasha: "No." I can he lp, though

lIaughsJ . 1 help everybody. I'm 
more into touching. I'm a flesh 
person. 

HOW DOES A JOHN SOLICIT YOU 
FOR SEX, NAUA? 

Nelia: A lot of johns think 
they're going to have sex just 
because they paid their agency fees. 
Then they get pissed when you tell 
them you're going to leave. Then 
they'll usually offer you another 
100 bucks. But shit, I might con-
sider touching you for 100 bucks, 
but sex? No. 

The young ones think like that 
especially. They think I'm young 
and cute, and they think it's just 
going to happen like a fucking 
movie. I've had a lot them. They 
know that's not what they're pay-
ing for, and they actually think 
you're going to sleep with them 
just because they're cu te and 
young. 

They say shit like, "Don 't you 
think I'm cute?" or "Did we not 
connect? Did we just not share 
something special there?" I actual-
ly laughed in that guy's face. He 
really thought there was something 
between us, like he wanted to save 
me. 

ANY BAD EXPERIENCES? 
Sasha: Not rea l bad, but uncom-

fortable. One time I was at this 
guy's house, and he thought he was 
going to get more than a massage. 
But 1 told him when 1 showed up 
that for the price he was paying he 
was only getting a massage. And he 
said, "Fine: 

Well , 1 was almost done, and he 
said, "So we're not going to have 
sex." And 1 said no. And he said, 
"Well I'm not going to pay for the 
whole hour; and he just flipped. I 
mean he was a cool guy at first , but 
his whole attitude just flipped and 
he turned crazy. And I'm like, 
"Well , thar's not what's going to 
happen. We're not going to have 
sex. If you want a little bit more, 
then I can help you with that . But if 
you're not willing to give me what 
I'm asking, I'm not go ing to take 
your money, because I feel I'm 
worth a certain amount because I 
have been doing this for a while, 
and I am very good at what 1 do, 
and I'm no t going to take any 
chump change." 

1 charge $150, and that 's just for 
touch. But 1 do it well because I do

the whole body, and 1 make it a 
relaxing situation. And I try to get it 
all together at first so 1 can do my 
thing, but he just got crazy, and 1 
called the cops because my boss 
told me to call the cops and tell 
them that a guy solicited me for 
sex. 

So I called, and I really didn't 
want them to come over. I just 
wanted someone to talk to this guy 
so 1 could get out of there, but he 
wouldn't let me leave. So 1 was talk-
ing on the phone with the lady, and 
I explained the situation, and she 
told me that I could leave. But 1 told 
her he wouldn't let me. He was just 
standing by the door and kept 
pushing me while I tried to walk 
out. But he wouldn't push me with 
his hands, just with his body. He 
made sure not to touch me with his 
hands. 

So I said, "Dude, you paid , I'm 
done with my service. I've been 
here for an hour. I'm out of here." 
And he got all mad, yelling, "No, 
na, no." And he hung up my 
phone. I.gave the lady my address, 
and he pushed my phone, and 1 
hung it up, and then he dug his 
hands in his pockets for his 
money while 1 was screaming 
"Hey, 1 need that money; and 
pushed me out the door and 
slammed the door in my face, and 
aliI could rea~ly say was "alrighty" 
at the door. 

But that's about it with con-
frontations. I've had jerks, though. 
Oh my God. There's all kinds of 
jerks. 

1 had this guy call me an asshole 
because I wouldn't have sex with 
him. He said, "No, 'escort' means 
'prostitute: That means you're 
coming over to fuck me, so you're 
an asshole: What did he say? False 
advertisement? The guy was this 6-
foot-5, big-ass old man and getting 
pissed. And 1 just wanted him to 
leave me alone. 1 told him to take it 
up with the agency and 1 just 
walked out. 

There's a lot of guys like that. 
Because that's what they expect: 
sex. It's because a lot" of them are 
businessmen coming in from out 
of town. So they just want a quick

ANY lAD EXPERIENCES? 
NaJia: There were once these 

big-ass Italian guys ... [ really don't 
know what they were, just fucking 
big European guys. They ran after 
me and this girl 1 had a call with and 
began chasing us in their undCfWear 
to our car. They wanted to get into 
our car and get their money back. 
They had paid the agency fees and 
thought they were going to get sex. 

Me and the girl were fairly new 
and thought the men knew the fees 
were only for dancing and massag-
ing. We thought they knew what 
they were getting. But when they 
asked for sex, and we told them 
that for the money they paid, we 
only danced, they demanded their 
money back, saying strange-ass 
shit to each other, while me and the 
other girl were looking for the right 
moment to run. 

So they chased us, these four or 
five hairy-ass European fuckers in 
their tighty-whities, banging on our 
car door and screaming for their 
money back. I kept on screaming 
that we were going to ca ll the cops 
while the other girl was fidgeting 
with the keys. 1 remember saying, 
"Do not drop the keys; while she 
was panicking with tears in her 
eyes. 1 wasn't crying myself, but 1 
was definitely shaking. 

HOW LONG DO YOU WANT TO 
KEEP DOING THIS? 

sasha: 1 don't want to work here 
anymore [laughsJ. I've been working 
here too long. This is not a career. 

HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN 
DOING THIS? 

sasha: Two years. 
Nalia: Nine months. 

WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY " IT'S 
NOT A CAREER?" 

Sasha: It could be, but it's not a 
lifelong career unless you take it to 
the next level. 

SO WHEN DO YOU WANT IT TO 
END? 

sasha: 1 give another three years 
to be on top and stable so 1 don't 
have to work anymore. And I can 
juS! take off and go to school and 
do what 1 want to do. 

WILDEST EXPERIENCE?

about it. 1 got paid $1,500. Two 
guys, three hours of pure pleasure 
for me. Oh my god, these guys 
pampered me like I was the only 
queen there. 1 was the only one. It 
was beautiful. They were both nice 
and stacked , and they both knew 
what to do with their stuff !IaughsJ. 
Well , one of the guys got into a car 
accident and he got a sett lement of 

$7,000. It was so funny how it hap-
pened. 

1 was giving him a massage, and 
1 was sitting next 10 him and curled 
up next to him, and he was lying on 
his stomach, and he tried to feel for 
me and he finally felt my leg and he 
said, "Wow, you're really small." 
And I sa id, "Yeah, well, isn't that a 
good thing?" And he just laid back 

down, and he finally turned around 
and said, "You know what, I know 
I'm a white boy and everything, but 
1 can break you." And I said, "Hu h? 
Whatever, guy." 

And there was two other guys 
there, and 1 knew one of them. And 
he said , "Yeah, me and Billy 100."

Continued from page 13 
And I firsl said no. And he asked 
ml' how much it was going to cost. 
And I asked him how long he 
wanted me to stav. and he lold me. 
"The rest of the ' night ." so I said, 
"Well. it's going to be a good 
$1.000." And he was like. "Well , for 
us 10 rt'ally hal'e fu n, we'lI give you 
15. Is thm ,III right?" And that 's 
when I agreed lIaughsJ. But he kept 
sayi ng. "Me and Billy too." 

And thl'y had painkillers. Lots 
of painkillers. Vicodin. Seminoles. 
Thl)se kepI thcm going, though . 
fk kept tdling me that his girl-
friend was out of town and Ihat he 
was really horny, but shit. three 
hours. And the whole rime I did 
this. I didn't open my eyes once. I 
was lost. But it was strange. I didn't 
really come. BUI I think the whole 
time I \\as - I don 'l know, it was 
too much . I guess there was a point 
I was yelling Jnd they stopped [ 
,Isk me if I was OK. And I told them 
I was OK. Then they just started 
takmg turns whiiL' the olher would 
JUSI strt1kc or kiss Illy face. It was 
cool. 

WILDEST EXPERIENCE? 
. Nalia: I gOt attacked by some 

girl once IIdughsJ. She threw me on 
thc bed dt ,I hotd P,lI1:y I was work-
Ing at and JUSt dttacked nK I guess 
the wildest thing was that I didn't 
Stop her. 

There .trc a lot of panics like 
Ihat. Tcn people, maybe two or 
thrcc danrers at a hotel room. 
Oncc, there was IhlS college bas-
kctball team 01'30 or -+0 people. and 
the coach was the one that was 
paying i'L)r it. I got picked up and 
thrown lwer. But parties arc just 
about dancll1g. Anything mon: is 
<I I\\ays one-on-one. 

MISCONCEPTIONS? 
5asha: People think you 're stu-

pid. They come at you thinking 
you're do ing what you're doing 
because you don'l have brai ns to 
do anyth ing else. I have brains. But 
I'm also a lazy person JlaughsJ. 
What I do is comfortable. . 

And you can't be stupid doing 
Ihis. You have to know how to read 
people. You've got to be quick on 
your toes. You can't be a dummy. or 
you'll be run over and ran through. 
But that's what people think of me: 
dumb. 

Nalia: How they think we need 
all this help. Like we need to be 
saved, saying things like, "You 're 
to.o good for .this." They're usually 
clients, and If I'm too good for 
"this," then I must be too good for 
them. since they are what I do. 

And women. Men might be stu-
pid to us, but women arc cruel. 

DESCRIBE THE COMMUNITY. 
Sasha: I know some of the girls. 

but you usually just see the recep-
tionist. So if it 's cash. you're sup-
posed to take your CU I out and 
you give them their piece. The 
particular agency I'm aI, they get 
60-40. ThaI's what a 101 of Ihe 
agenci~s are doing now. They're 
nOI doing half and half anymore. 
And the ones thaI are doi ng half 
and half is the place that lady 
burned me at. 

And I'm barely starting to get 
back il1lo it. I've been doing Ihis 
for two years, but !'slopped for a 
good four months. I took some 
vacation off because I did rea l 
good. We got out of our house. I 
was living at a th rt:e-bedroom 
house, paying a good $1.200 a 
month alone with one. two, three, 
fou r olher people living with me -
well. tive, bu t thaI extra five i~ 
bringing in money as well. ' But I 
go t this chick. her man, her prt:g-
nant ass, her kid. plus my kid wilh 
me. Homeboy helps too, but Ihat 
girl was Just lazy. 

The UCSD Guardian 

HOW MUCH DO YOU MAKE? 
Nalia: On a good day, $1.000. 

And il varies. It could be two calls 
or seven ca lls. if I get good calls, 
men who appreciate Ihat I'm 
there for the company. Thcy 
apprecia te that I come over with a 
smile and am not a bitch about 
the money. I come to have fun. 
I'm not going to have sex with 
you, but I'm here to have fun . 
Because I always make Ihat clear. I 
hate getting myself into situations 
I can't get our of. 

So in a good week I can make a 
good $3.000 or $5,000. I once 
made a grand each nigh I for two 
consecutive nights with one 
client. 

CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE 
SEASONS? 

Nalia: Income tax season isn 't 
great for the expected reasons. 
Holidays like Thanksgiving arc 
slow because they're with their 

~amilies. But . Christmas picks up 
JUSt a lillie bi t. because of all the 
lonely guys out here with nobody 
10 call. 

Last Christmas I got live calls 
Christmas day. All of Ihem wa nled 
sex but weren't willing to pay what 
I wal1led. So I just helped them 
and they were cool with that. They 
JUS t \\<]l1led someone to hang out 
wuh on ChrIStmas. I guess il d es 
makc you feci special, feci 10l'cd 
JlaughsJ. 

OTHER INTERESTS? 
Sllshll: Parties. I have an addic-

lines. I love It. It 's cool. the con-
nection you can make over the

lyTOMW 
Senior Staff Writer 

In his classic poem, the 
"Aeneid: Vergil describes the coast 
of Libya, where Aeneas lands his 
beleaguered crew fo r a breathtak-
ing view filled wi th lush foorests, 
towering cliffs and spark ling water. 

"There are high cliffs on this 
side and on that. and twin peaks 
towering heavenward .... Over 
these. against a fo rest backdrop 
shimmering. a dark and shaggy 
grove casts a deep shade. while in 
the cliffside opposite ... there is a 
cave with fresh water ... : 
- This must be the scene that 
people see when they visit the trop-
ical island of Fuga. located at the 
northernmost tip of the Philip-
pines. Tropical forests. coral reefs. 
wondrous cliffs overlooking the 
deep, blue sea. That is. he or she 
would see these things if visitors 
were allowed onto the island. 

You see. benealh this beautiful 
surface of a virtual paradise island 
lie dark. macabre secrets: [he plight 

- of the indigenous people, subjected 
to the-abuse of the corporation that 
"owns" the island, the natives' suf-
fering from diseases with no aid 
from the Philippine government. 
and a 50 percent infant mortality 
rate. As the promotional p ster so 
adequalely decries, "Fuga Island -
A Paradise for Whom?" . 

The documentary, called "The 
Silent Natives of Fuga." PUI tOgeth-
er by artist, photographer and film -
maker Karie Garnier, cri tically 
examines the beamy of the island 
and the harsh realities beneath it. 
Garnier, one of the few outsiders to 
have visiled the little-known island 
and whose wife. Violeta, is from

wore boots. cowboy boots. Typical 
older nlan. He wal1l~d me w bc hiS 
girl. and in return . show mc around 
the world, BUI I declin~d. 

HAVE YOU EVER FALLEN FOR A 
JOHN? 

Sasha: Actually. yes. He's not 
even a client any more. he's 1I10re 
of a friend: 1'111 not ialling for him. 
but I'm developing feelings f r 
him I shouldn't be feeling. He 
never paid for sex. But he's got a 
girl now. I once asked him if he 
wanted to be my boyfriend. 
[laughsJ. But I'm not asking for a 
monogamous relationshi p 
because of the situation . And he 
asked me if I wanted to move in. 
but I had package - well. not 
package. he 's my pride and joy. 
That's OK, I don 't want people to 
th ink I'm looking for a daddy. He ' 
already has one. 

WHAT ARE CLIENTS LOOKING 
FOR? 

Nalia: Sex JlaughsJ. It 's actually 
half and hal f. Half of them are just 
looking for a quick lillie come. But 
the other half is looking for some-
one to chill with. get to know: a 
girlfriend for the night. 

IS IT HARD FOR YOU TO RELATE 
TO PEOPLE? 

Sasha: Very. Actually. no, It 's not 
hard for me to relate 10 other peo-
ple because I'm not as judgmental 
since I started doing this. H w can 
you be? It 's hard for them to relate 
to me. 

And I meet crazy people. I meet 
colonels in the Army and avy that 
wanted 10 get banged in the bUll 
with fucking triangle dildos and 
Stuff. And half of the time. these 

Fuga. fell in love with the beauty of 
the island and with the 2.000 per-
secuted people. "The Silent Natives 
of Fuga" "is a call to awareness. 
both of the plight of these people 
and the nature of globalism in 
Third World countries: as Execu-
tive Producer Svend-Erik Eriksen 
stated. 

The film itself is composed of 
675 still photos and is narra ted by 
Garnier. The narration and photos 
follow the sequence of events that 
Garnier and his wife go through as 
they return to the island 10 visit 
Violeta's family. 

The pictures remove the com-
plexity of a rolling film and unob-
trusively layout the truth. If there 
is ever a time when a picture is 
worth a thousand words. it is when 
a person watches this documen-
tary. 

As Garnier's pictures capture 
Ihe intense beauty of the island, he 
likewise encapsulates tlie poverty 
and crises that the people endure. 
For every photo of the perfect, 
sandy beach. there is a picture of a 
malnutritioned child. whose stom -
ach is bloated with parasiles. For 
every picture of a glowing sunset, 
there is a picture of an old woman 
suffering from rickets. For every 
sti ll photo of a beautiful flower. 
there is a picture of the grave of 
one of the 12 to 14 babies who die 
each year in this tiny community of 
400 families. 

The documentary was shown 
free to the public on Monday, May 
21 at UCSD. However, Garnier 
plans 10 lake his documentary to 
other campuses and to national 
organizations in the Uniled States 
and Canada to garner permanent 
support to assistlhe natives of Fuga.

don't carry any toys. 

I had one guy thaI wanted me

"Oh YOll know, my girlfriend did

I also had this guy that wallled

gave it 10 me. and he wanted me to 
wear it and walk around. He said. "I 
walll you to walk around. and I'm

while I'm playing with myself. I

years is how much longer I want to 
do it. Oh, plus I want to learn how 
to DJ for the people JlaughsJ. Drum 
and bass. I want 10 do something

WHAT IS YOUR IDEAL LIFE? 
Nalia: My own fashion line. I 

sketch out outfits almost every 
night. And hey, with what I do. 
fashion is a must. I know what men 
like and what women want. 

And computers [laughsJ. It Â·s 
funny. but I'm a computer nerd. 

The UCSD Guardian 

He hopes to eventually show th is 
documentary in the Philippines and 
to affect President Gloria Arroyo 
enough to fulfill "her dream to visit 
Fuga island" and to address the 
needs of its impoverished people. 

The spread of globalization has 
threatened the livelihood of the 
people. T he "owner" of the island. 
Chinese billionaire Tan Yu. is plan -
ning 10 build "the model city of the 
21st century." complcte with 17 
golf courses. an airport, 12.000 
hotel rooms and "the biggest gam-
bling casino on earth ." 

However, in this conglomera-
tion of corporate greed. the 2,000 
poor natives have been forgotten 
and ignored . often threatened into 
silence. The natives, suffering from 
malnutrition. disease and humility. 
are forced by the guards. many of 
whom look more like Viet Cong 
peasa nt soldiers than guards, to 
live in utter despair. As one nati ve 
put it. "Over the decades. the 
guards forced us to live this way." 
Many who try to leave by boat are 
beaten. while those who do make it 
to the main island of the Philip-
pines arc shun ned because of Iheir 
illiteracy. 

Garnicr seeks 10 expose harsh 
reali ty and to bring atten tion 10 thl' 
troubles in Fuga. With his docu-
mentary "The Silent ~atil'es of 
Fuga," Garnier hopes to spread thl' 
issue to all corners I' America and 
to garner what he calls "positive 
support. " 

Go to http://www.sfll.calfllga for 
more in~ rmation and histOry. 
Despitc the support Garnier and 
Ihe natives Â· will obtain. they still 
face an uphill banle. It is indeed 
what Garnier considers a "fight 
between Goliath and David."

Ben Harper Lights 
Up RIMAe Field 
San Diego favorite teams up with 
Jurassic 5 and Jack Johnson 
By JOSEPH LEE 
Hiatus Editor 

San Diego showed its pret ty 
side Monday as gray clouds gave 
way to blue skies for Ben H arper 
and the Innocent Criminals, Juras-
sic 5 and Jack Johnson at RIMAC 
Field. 

. A laid-back crowd accompa-
nlcd the p leasant weather. I might 
be pushi ng it , but there was a 
1960s Wood stock vibe to th e 
entire concert . People were relax-
ing on blankets and enjoying the 
company of the thousands who 
showed up for the concert . As 
some concertgoers put it , there 
was a "communal" fee ling sur-
rounding everyone. 

The golden sun of Memorial 
Day cast the perfect lighting for the 
acoustic groove of Jack Johnson. 
Smooth bass riffs and acoustic gui-
tar rounded out a sound that was 
remi niscen t of headliner Ben 
Harper. 

As dusk settled, Jurassic 5 took 
the stage and played an incredible 
sct. For those in the audience un fa-
miliar with Jurassic 5, this set was 
the perfect crash co urse to their 
eclectic sound. Jurassic 5 's impro-
I'lsed rhymes and clea n harmonies 
werc fabulous, and their bea ts kept 
cvcryone 011 their feet with their 
hands lip ill the air. 

J-5 effectively charged the dudi-
ence for the triumphant appear-
ance of Bei1 Harper .and the Inno-
cent CrIminals. 

the rest, who have performed at 
UCSD twice before, did not waste 
any time going through a set that 
ranged from l ighter aco ustic mate-
r ialto hard-edged jams with Harp-
er 's solo work paying tribute to Jimi 
Hendrix. 

Harper 's wide range of musical 
styles match the wide range of gui -
tars that he brought onstage. Slide 
guitar is his signature instrument, 
but the way he handled his 
acoustic guitar and the rest of his 
electric guitars made many a jaw 
drop with amazement. 

He played a passable cover of 
Stevie Wonder's "Supersti ti on," but 
the highlight of the show came 
when he played "Burn One Down." 
With the first few chords of the 
song, a curious plume of thick, fra-
g rant smoke drifted over the 
crowd. What else could you 
expect? 

H arper finished his set with a 
rousing rendition of his recent hit, 
" Steal My Kisses," but he later 
reappeared for the encore. He 
started with a couple of intimate 
acoustic songs by himself and was 
later j oined by the vocal group 
Bl ind Boys of A labama, who added 
a soulful gospel sound to the last 
songs of H arper 's encore. This 
mellow part o f the evening kept 
much of the audience quier-as they 
listcncd in awe. 

T his was by far one o f the best 
concerts that UCSD has hosted 
recently. Jack Johnson and Jurassic 
5 were both incredible, b ut if Ben 
Harper and the Innocent Criminals 
p layed any better, they would be 
guilty as charged.

collegiate Rowing Association 
Championships, where she 
stepped in fo r an injured Beckham 
to successfully lead the tea m. This 
fine performance, among others, 
was enough to garner her the 
Heart and Hustle team award, 
which is given to those who give 
110 percelll day in and day out. 

Jessica Jocius, who will be grad-

the varsity eight and a reserve on 
the four. She was a second-year 
rower who found success in the 
Triton boats. She too was a recipi-

Amanda Hawkins was a first-

senior year and helping UCSD to a 
gold medal III the novice fo ur race 
at the WIRA Championships. She 
was also a key contributor when 
that same boat picked up a silver at 
the Pacific Coast Rowing Champi-

Amelyn Ho is a second-year 
rower who will be leaving behind 
her UCSD oars come the end of 
the school year. She was a member 
of the novice eight boat that picked 
up a bronze medal at the WIRA 
Championships and one at the 
Pacific Coast Fi nals. 

Rebecca Rodriguez is a firs t-

an exemplary student. Her compo-

"The girls that came in as seniors 
really helped us to build our .pro-
gram: Pinkerton ' said. "We have 
over 50 rowers and are getting 
stronger because of these girls. They 
really showed a lot of leadership and 
helped out the younger girls." 

According to Pinkerton, the 
athletes who have been here for 
two years also meant a lot to the 
program. 

"The girls that came in and 
competed for two years were also 
great: she said . "They really 
steppea up in that time and put our 
program on the map nationally." 

Though they have to go, Pinker-

Spirit: 
League breaks new 
ground for women 
Continued from page 20 
erally. That was the year that Bran-
di Chastain pulled off her jersey to 
reveal a now-famous sports bra 
after kicking the winning penalty 
shot against China to win the first 
Women's World Cup. 

"It wasn't until the success of 
the Word Cup that a lot of 
investors and sponsors said 'we 
want to get behind this:" Foudy 
said. 

This league is not one of scrubs 
or wash-ups. It is not some sort of 
World Football League, XFL or 
CBA. The league fea tu res the best, 
not just in the United States, but 
fro m around the world. 

"Actually, the level is incredi-
ble," Foudy said. "You have on the 
field, at one given time, seven 
Olympians. We have the beSt in the 
world. It 's really the only profes-
sional league of th is ca liber in the 
world: 

Take_ the Spirit, fo r starters. The 
team boasts national stars such as 

J ulie .Foudy, Shannon McMillian 
and Joy Fawcett (who is not playing 
this year due to pregnancy). They 
also have some international gems 
in Kristin Bengtsson and Ulrika 
Ka lrsson of Sweden, and Fan Yun-
jie of China 

"It 's the best league in the 
world; the best players in the 
world," said Spirit head coach Car-
los Juarez. "We have thi best play-
ers from the national team as well 
as the best international players. I 
think it's a great opportun ity for 
people and soccer fans to get the 
opportunity to come and watch the 
best players playing. It's kind of like 
the NBA or the NFL: 

"It's a challenge in that you 
need to day-in and day-out make 
sure that you give them quality that 
you challenge them so that they are 
getting something new and so~eÂ­
thing energetic," Juarez saId . 
"They're good players, ~ut . t.he 
challenge is to make them mdlvld-
ua lly better and for them to 
become a team: 

The fo rming and success of the 
WUSA is one of the greatest 
accomplishments in women's at~Â­
letics, though it did not come easI-
ly. \ 

"There are always skeptics out 
there Isaying] that women's leagues 
don't work ; Foudy said. "We had 
people saying 'don't do it, you 
won't be able to raise the money,' If 
we had ever listened to them we 
would never be where we are. The 
~reat thing is that it gives a lot of 
remale athletes courage to say 'hey 
we believe we can get our own 
league off the ground,' We don't 
have an NBA sustain ing us, or an 
MLS. We want to do th is on our 
own." 

The key to the Spirit and the 
WUSA's success is fan support. 
Wi thout fan support, there are no 
sold-out games, no television cov-
erage and no league. 

"I think our fan is about median 
age 12 years old ," Foudy said. "I 
think there's a void with young 
kids in terms of identifying wi th 
professional teams and going to 
games because it's not affordable 
anymore and it's been catered to 
the corporate community so much. 
I ttj,jnk we rea lly want to hit grass 
roots and young kids, which we've 
been so successful wi th at the 
national team level." 

The UCSD Guardian 

"We need to be successful ," 
Juarez said. "We need to make sure 
we put on a good show, that our 
games are good, that our fans are 
entertained. Our chances are good 
because we have good role m'odels 
and we have good players." 

The Spirit has had a shaJ..l' start. 
They have a record of 1-3-2, but 
have been competitive in all of the 
games. â¢ 

"Short-term, we need to make 
the playoffs: Juarez said. "The goal 
is to win the championship. We are 
very capable of that. The long-term 
for the league is obviously for us to 
draw good attendance and for peo-
ple to fo llow us not just for one 
game or a season, but for many 
years to come. I th ink that's going

A team so full of talent can be a 
blessing - and difficult but 
Juarez is up to the test. 

The thousa nds of screaming 
fans at Spirit games can attest to its 
effectiveness. The team plays its 
home games at Torrero Stadium on 
the campus of the University of 
San Diego. So far, three home 
games have been played, with as 
many sellouts.

Get spiritual with 
the new women's 
soccer league 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

Imagine being the best at what you do 
without having a workplace in which to do 
it. This was the problem for the top women 
soccer players in the world. 

It was a problem, that is, until April 14. 
That is the date that the Washington 

Freedom hosted the San Franciso Cyber-
Rays in the first ever Women's United Soc-
cer Association match. 

History was made. Or perhaps more 
properly put, herstory was made. 

The league, founded February 15, 2000, 
.is made up of eight teams. San Diego is 
lucky enough to be home to one of the 
clubs, the Spirit. 

Founding WUSA was a long time com-
ing and was not an easy task. 

"Ten yea rs ago, Iwe hadl no thoughts 
about a league," said Spirit star Julie Foudy. 
"It wasn 't realistic. Five years ago was prob-
ably the first formation of 'you know, wow, 
this is something we can maybe get off the 
ground.' That was probably because of the 
Olympics in '96. That was the first time 
America got a glimpse of our national team 
and women's soccer in general. As players, 
we had always dreamt of it, of course." 

The U.S. national women's team came 
into its own in the 1996 Olympics, winning 
the gold. 

Then in 1999, things really took off. Lit-

Crew Bids Adieu to Graduating Seniors 
Team Captain Heather Beckham among the nine leaving crew members 
By SCOTT BURROUGHS 
A ssociate Sports Editor 

UCSD women's crew is saying 
sayonara to nine excellent athletes 
who are paddling off into the sun-
set after years of dedication and 
inspired performances as mem -
bers of the squad. 

Chief among these athletes is 
team captain Heather Beckham, 
who has held the leadership posi-
tion fo r the last two years. 

Beckham was a four-year rower 
who really brought a lot to lriton 
crew. She was the stroke for the 
lightweight squad, where she con-
tributed stellar boat performances 
and an outstanding leadership 
persona that helped the team gar-
ner many top fin ishes and gair.ed 

her nominations for rowing's All-
American Division II Team as well 
as for Athlete of the Year. 

Beckham was, in fact, so 
respected that her teammates went 
to great lengths to establish an 
award in her honor. The appropri-
ately titled Heather Beckham 
Award is given to the outgoing 
senior who has best exemplified 
the team' perseverance, diligence 
and pursuit of excellence through-
out her career at UCSD. 

Coach Pani Pinkel10n elabo-
rates, "IBeckhaml was a great cap-
tain, and she performed well at a 
very ' key position for us. She was 
loved and well-respected by all of 
her teammates and was just a 
main contributor for us during her 
time here." 

Teammate Julie Snyder is 
another Triton athlete who has 
taken to the boat for the last time 
in the team's beloved blue and 
gold uniforms, 

Snyder was the only other 
four-year senior on crew and 
made a huge impact during that 
time. She was a crucial component 
of the team 's championship light-
weight crew, where her ability in 
the water was only overshadowed 
by the way she led the squad. 

Her skills and leadership ability 
were good enough to secure the 
team a seventh ranking nation-
wide. One of her crowning 
achievements came when she was 
named as a Collegiate Rowing 
Coaching Association National 
Athlete Scholar. 

Carrie Blemker is the third Tri-
ton crew member who is bidding 
adieu after a solid career. She has 
been getting it done for' UCSD 
crew for twQ.,. years and will be 
missed when the boats are 
launched next season. She was a 
member of the championship-win-
ning lightweight four boat as well 
as pal1 of the lightweight eight. 

Her commitment and achieve-
ments were vital to the program's 
success the last two years. 

Jamie Cooper is another sec-
ond-year rower who made an 
impact fur the lritons and who 
will not be around next year. She 
was a member of the lightweight 
eight crew as well as a reserve on
