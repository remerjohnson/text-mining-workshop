The steam machines that have injured 28 
Housing, Dining and Hospitality department 
custodial employees this quarter will be banned 
effective March 3. 

After Campuswide Senator Victor Flores-
Osorio introduced a resolution to ban the machines 
at the Feb. 16 A.S. Council meeting, the HDH 
Committee brought the issue to the department’s 
attention. HDH reviewed the resolution and 
after an evaluation of its steam equipment, HDH 
decided on Thursday, Feb. 24, to return to using 
more environment-friendly alternatives.

Associate Director of Housing, Dining and 
Hospitality Jana Severson said that it is too early 
to determine the costs of discontinuing the steam 
cleaning program, but that HDH will try its best to 
minimize costs, if there are any.

“Green cleaning solutions will be used instead 
of the steam machines,” Severson said. “There 
is no additional cost to use the green cleaning 
machines. This is the program HDH had in place 
prior to implementing steam.”

The return to green cleaning solutions will 
not impact work flow or maintenance, as these 
cleaning solutions were used throughout UCSD’s 
facilities until HDH started its steam cleaning 
program in fall of 2010. HDH launched this pilot 
program to implement more environmentally 
friendly cleaning measures.

“HDH [was] already using green cleaning 
solutions throughout our facilities, but [the steam 
machines were] one step greener,” Severson said. 
“However, the main reason for the switch was 
in looking for ways to prevent typical custodial 
repetitive injuries based on scrubbing patterns. 
Steam cleaning is also helpful for students and staff 
who suffer from allergies or chemical sensitivities.”

HDH said it attempted to help all employees 
transition to the use of steam machines by 
encouraging its staff to attend training sessions 
and to stretch. It reviewed employee concerns and 
made the steam machine program voluntary after 
it was implemented, so workers did not have to use 
steam if they prefer using the chemical cleaning 
products. 

Twenty-eight workers had reported injuries 
including steam burns, permanent nerve damage, 
back pain and neck pain to HDH.  

“During this voluntary portion of the program, 
we have had staff continue [to] use the equipment 
without injury,” Severson said. “Additionally, out 
of concern for our employees, we started the third-
party ergonomic evaluation of the equipment.”

Flores-Osorio was surprised that the decision 
to ban steam machines was made so quickly.

“I actually didn’t believe it because I thought 
it would be a little longer process,” Flores-Osorio 
said. “I thought at the earliest it would have 
happened at the HDH meeting, which I think 
would have been tomorrow or the next Monday. 
I’m really glad that HDH has taken a stance 
in which [it’s] saying that our workers are not 
disposable and that [it is] able to sustain the 
health of our workers as well as the health of the 
environment as well as the overall state of UCSD’s 
cleanliness.”

UC Office of the President and  UCSD are 
negotiating terms for the UC-wide student 
health insurance plan. UCSD is concerned 
about participating because the UC plan does 
not offer as much coverage as the UCSD 
version, would cost more and remove the free 
health care services students receive from the 
two on-campus medical centers.

The goal of the UC–wide insurance plan is 
to combine all students in the UC system, which 
increases negotiating power with insurance 

companies — allowing UCOP control over 
policies and replacing insurance companies as 
the middleman. The larger student pool would 
disperse insurance risks that makes it less costly 
to bear the costs of insurance claims if an many 
people filed for claims.  

The UCSD Student Health Insurance 
Advisory Committee was concerned the 
systemwide plan would eliminate the 
improvements made to UCSD’s USHIP plan this 
year in accordance with Barack Obama’s Health 
Reform Act. The improvements included better 
immunization, dental and vision benefits, 
as well as the competitive mental healthcare 

coverage. Also, the plan would cause the two 
medical centers to bear a larger percentage of 
the costs, so students would no longer be able 
to receive free medical care there.

Although a systemwide plan for graduate 
students called UC-GSHIP was implemented 
Fall Quarter, the UCSD committee 
recommended on Feb. 18 against expanding 
the model to USHIP for next year.

On Feb. 23, the UC-wide committee 
that manages negotiations with insurance 
companies contacted UCSD Student Health

Stem cell researcher Wilda Helen left the United States for Indonesia on the morning of Feb. 27, the last day she was allowed to legally remain in the country.Helen is a 32-year-old postdoctoral fellow who worked 
in bioengineering assistant professor Adam Engler’s stem cell and 
bioengineering lab for two years before being fired on Jan. 6. In 
response, Helen filed an appeal stating that her termination was 
based on false allegations — which have not been disclosed, as the 
investigation of her termination is ongoing.

Helen wanted to schedule an arbitration hearing to appeal her 
termination through a neutral third party. But labor relations advocate 
Belinda Hein did not agree on the three arbitrators who were available 
for a hearing during the week of Feb. 21.

“I am being denied due process solely because I’m an immigrant 
worker,” Helen said in a statement.   “The university’s position is 
discriminatory toward me and all international postdoctoral scholars.” 

Members of United Auto Workers Local 5810 — a union 
representing 6,000 postdoctoral researchers in the UC system — will 
continue with the arbitration process.

The university released a statement on Feb. 25 claiming that Helen 
will have the opportunity to have her grievances heard before an 
arbitrator, even if she is not in the country.

“Dr. Helen will still have her hearing and the university has offered 
that she may participate through teleconferencing or other available 
web media that is convenient for Dr. Helen,” the statement read. “We 
continue to be open to discussions with the union of alternative methods 
to ensure that Dr. Helen’s grievances will be heard.”

On Feb. 23, about 45 students, researchers and workers were 
threatened with arrest after occupying the Chancellor’s Complex,

Adhesive Tape Test Increases Accuracy of  Melanoma Diagnosis
SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY

By Michael Chang
Contributing Writer

A new test with adhesive tape could 
be effective in detecting melanomas in 
suspicious lesions on the skin. 

This noninvasive experimental test 
relies on the adhesiveness of specialized 
tape to collect cells from skin lesions in 
order to diagnose skin cancer. 

The adhesive tape, a patch about 
the size of a nickel, is rubbed directly 
over the lesion to collect RNA, 
which is analyzed for genes that are 
specific to melanoma, according to 
clinical medicine professor William 
Wachsman. 

Melanomas are the leading cause 
of death from skin cancer — which 
is the most common form of cancer 
in the U.S. 

Normally, dermatologists identify 
melanomas by first visually examining 
the region, then performing a biopsy if 
the region seems suspicious.

“We’re trying to provide an 
additional tool to the dermatologist 
that would enable them to make a 

better decision on whether to biopsy 
a lesion, and if they did biopsy it, 
they would be better off doing the 
appropriate excision,” Wachsman said. 

More invasive biopsies have 
traditionally been performed on 
lesions as the main way of detecting 
melanomas. Biopsies of lesions remove 
parts of tissue in that region, leaving 
visible scars. 

The vast majority of the suspicious 
lesions dermatologists examine   — 
which are darkly pigmented spots 
that resemble moles or birthmarks — 
do not turn out to be melanomas, 
according to Wachsman. 

“They’ll often do something that 
is called shave or scoop biopsies,” 
Wachsman said. “On occasion, you can 
actually cut through the melanoma, 
especially if it’s invasive, and then you 
can’t even determine a stage of the 
disease.”

In addition, biopsies have a hit 
rate of 3.5 percent in effectively 
determining melanomas. 

“Now, as opposed to a hit rate of 
3.5 percent, they [the adhesive tape 

tests] have a hit rate of 88 percent,” 
Wachsman said. 

By using RNA to detect melanomas, 
specific genes can be identified that 
lead to melanomas. 

“We identified a grouping of 17 
genes that formed the predictor [for 
melanoma],” Wachsman said. “It is 
essentially a multi-gene biomarker.”

The adhesive tape method can also 
differentiate between different stages 
of melanoma.

“It picks up both early forms of 
disease: the [inciting] stage of disease as 
well as [the] invasive stage of disease,” 
Wachsman said. “It also picks up the 
different subtypes of melanoma.”

Examining RNA from cells in the 
lesioned area can determine which 
genes coding for melanomas are 
activated.

“It’s not felt that melanoma actually 
exists in the stratum cornea, the 
topmost layer of the skin,” Wachsman 
said. “It’s actually below the surface. 
We were asking the question, ‘Can we 
possibly see a signal in the stratum 
cornea?’ What we’re surprised by is that 

we cannot see a signal, but it appears 
that there are genes that are known to 
be associated with melanoma in the 
stratum cornea.”

The adhesive tape method was 
developed by the La Jolla-based biotech 
company DermTech International, at 
which Wachsman serves as an advisor. 

The adhesive tape test will undergo 
further testing before DermTech seeks 
approval from the Food and Drug 
Administration.

where police officers were present. The 
protesters called on Chancellor Marye 
Anne Fox to direct the UCSD Labor 
Relations office to schedule a hearing 
before Helen was scheduled to leave. 

According to UAW Local 5810 
representative Scott Clifthorne, police 
came in to remove supporters who 
waited in the Chancellor’s office for 15 
minutes.

“We had a rally to ask Chancellor 
Fox to make the right decision,” UAW 
Local 5810 President Xiaoqing Cao 
said. “We were there for 15 minutes 
and we were asked to leave by the 
[administrators and then] police.”

Protesters then left at Helen’s 
request. Fox — who said the week 
before that she would not be involved 

— was not present at the time. 
Two days before, on Feb. 21, the 

Graduate Student Association passed 
a resolution in support of Helen’s case 
and condemning the lack of proactive 
effort by UCSD administrators.

A.S. Council then passed the same 
resolution on Feb. 23.

Since filing her appeal, Helen, 
supporters and union members 
attempted to pressure Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox into forcing the 
UCSD Labor Relations office to agree 
on an arbitrator. In addition, the union 
contacted political representatives such 
as Congressman Bob Filner, D-Calif., 
and California State Assembly Speaker 
John A. Perez to extend her stay. The 
union also contacted UCSD Director 
of Labor Relations Kerry M. Donnell 

to restore Helen’s record on the Student 
and Exchange Visitor Information 
System — which let Helen stay in 
the U.S. legally as an international 
scholar. But, according to UAW 5810 
representative Neal Sweeney, Donnell 
refused to do so.

On Jan. 25, Helen found out her 
SEVIS record was deleted, which 
meant her J-1 would be invalidated 
within 30 days. However, Helen had 
10 days to leave the country by Feb. 5.

With the help of Filner — who 
contacted the Department of 
Homeland Security — Helen received 
a last-minute extension to stay in the 
country for 22 additional days.

Services Director Regina Fleming in 
hopes of working out an agreement.

A.S. SHIP and Wellness 
representative Alex Vu said another 
concern is how UCSD could lose 
some of the competitive mental health 
care rates and co-insurance discounts 
offered in the current plan.

“Regarding issues like mental 
health, the committee saw that the 
UC-wide insurance company could 
not pay a good rate for providers 
compared to our current insurance,” 
Vu said. “UCSD could lose the coveted 
10 percent co-insurance discount.”

The committee is also concerned 
the plan does not provide the level of 
medical-service access UCSD students 
receive.

“The insurance plan should be a 
supplement to what you cannot get 
on campus,” Fleming said. “On our 
campus, we have a pharmacy, X-ray 
and laboratory. A uniform health 
plan that could jeopardize this level 
of coverage just does not make sense.”

Now, the medical centers offer 

100-percent coverage to students 
after annual deductibles — a benefit 
unique to UCSD. But when the UCSD 
committee presented the proposed 
UC-USHIP to UCSD medical centers, 
medical center representatives said 
they could only guarantee full coverage 
for one more year under the UC-wide 
plan. Afterward,  students will be in 
charge of a percentage of medical costs.

Vu also expressed concerns that 
insurance companies reimbursed 
doctors in varying degrees. Since 
the reimbursement rate is lower in 
Southern California than in Northern 
California, insurance premiums are 
also lower in Southern California.

“The smoothing out [of premiums] 
seems to be negative for our university,” 
Vu said. “There are benefits to the 
model, like if we had crazy claims one 
year, Northern California would help 
us pay out. It’s not so much that we 
are against or for it, but rather that this 
was implemented without our consent 
or advisory, which was kind of sketch.”

In addition, committee members 
were unsure of UCOP’s governance 

plan regarding the insurance plan.
Concerns with the organization of 

current UC-GSHIP also raised doubts.
“We’ve already had some difficulty 

UC-GSHIP, such as enrolling students 
and other logistical things,” Fleming 
said. “There are just too many 
unresolved issues.”

The UCSD Committee is, however, 
willing to negotiate with UCOP.

“At this point, I don’t know if our 
concerns will be addressed, but we’ll 
see,” Fleming said. 

UCOP spokesperson Steve Montiel 
said that UCOP could not comment 
on UCSD’s concerns.

“Nobody really knows the full 
picture yet,” Montiel said. 

The committee will meet with 
UCOP insurance representatives again 
this week to see if their concerns can 
be addressed before providing Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Penny 
Rue with a final recommendation on 
whether to join the UC-wide system.

Massive protests swept Wisconsin this month after state Congress intro-
duced a bill that would wipe out 
public-sector unions to overcome a 
$137 billion shortfall. 

As usual, legislators nationwide 
are quick to vilify unions for budget 
deficits. But the real villains are ris-
ing health care costs and dwindling 
pensions, which have taken a hit 
during the recession. 

Granted, union leaders in 
states like California have already 
accepted cuts and furloughs to 
meet budget shortfalls. But public 
employees in Wisconsin already 
earn 4.8 percent less per hour 
than comparable employees in the 
private sector, according to the 
Economic Policy Institute. What’s 
more, Wisconsin unions are willing 
to accept the pension cost increase 
that would result in a 7-percent 
wage decrease. They just won’t 
stand for Republican Gov. Scott 
Walker’s attempt to weaken public 
unions’ bargaining power.

Walker’s bill would only let 
unions bargain regarding pay 
increases subject to inflation, and 
even those are subject to referen-
dum. If the voters object to those 
efforts, public workers like teachers 
and nurses will suffer wage decreas-
es even as inflation rises. And while 
some of us may harbor grudges 
against annoying high school teach-
ers, none of them, I assure you, 
deserve this. 

Similar bills in Ohio and Indiana 
have galvanized public protest 
against this unabashed attempt at 
stripping public employees of their 
rights: Students and workers packed 
the capitol building’s rotunda on 
Feb. 19 to protest passage of the 
bill .

The Tea Party, in its insatiable 
desire to fan the flames of con-
troversy, has come out in favor of 
Walker’s cost-cutting proposal. But 
budget shortfalls should not be 
balanced on the backs of the most 
vulnerable members of the public 
sector. 

Deficits should be addressed 
with uniform spending cuts and tax 
increases that are fair to as many 
as possible. Democratic Gov. Pat 
Quinn of Illinois raised his state’s 
income tax from 3 percent to 5 per-
cent to alleviate budget woes. And 
even Gov. Jerry Brown’s proposed 
budget — no object of praise itself, 
especially for its proposed $500 
million cut to the UC system — 
includes minimal tax increases and 
spending cuts across the board.

Still, many are quick to blame 
public employees for paying less into 
their pensions than private sector 
workers. Unfortunately, those in the 
private industry used to enjoy simi-
lar benefits, but with the demise of 
private sector unions, these benefits 
have, for the most part, eroded. 

Arguing that public employees 
should increasingly bear the deficits 
only creates a race to the bottom for 
workers in terms of salary and ben-
efits. And with drastic, across-the-
board cuts already all but inevitable 
in Wisconsin, there’s no reason that 
teachers and sanitation workers 
should be blamed for the state’s fis-

We Can Cut 
Costs Without 
Ruining Lives

Every spring, students are inundated with hopeful future councilmembers promis-ing to bring change to campus. But with  
total absences nearing 400 this year alone, it’s 
clear that change needs to start within A.S. 
Council to keep its members accountable to 
their political parties and the student body. 

Seven members of council have accrued at 
least three unexcused absences so far, which is 
grounds for dismissal. The problem’s nothing 
new, and, unfortunately, neither is the punish-
ment, which more often than not is simply a 
slap on the wrist. And considering that past 
councilmembers have been hesitant at best to 
impeach their peers, there is little reason to 
believe that this is the year that those shirking 
their responsibilities will face the rightful con-
sequences. 
        The all-star absentee this year is Arts and 
Humanities Senator Shunya Wade, coming in 
at a staggering 19.5 absences (council counts 
absences for various committee meetings and 
the second roll call at the end of Wednesday 
night meetings counts as half an absence). 

Coming in at a not-so-close second is Assistant 
Vice President of Student Organizations Carli 
Thomas, who has seven absences. Third is tied 
between Associate Vice President of Enterprise 
Operations Brian McEuen and Campuswide 
Senator Deyna Roberson, who each have six 
absences. Rounding out the bottom three are 
Sixth College Senator Kristian Castro (four), 
Campuswide Senator Jennifer Tzi (four), and 
Warren Senator Maclen Zilber (three and a 
half).

As a whole, there have been 81 unexcused 
absences for the current council, with Wade 
representing nearly a quarter of the total. The 
number is astounding, considering that many 
of these students were elected with the expecta-
tions they would represent voters’ interests on 
council. Since they were elected with the expec-
tation of championing a specific contingent’s 
views, their failure to show up ensures unfair 
representation and that A.S. Council is hardly a 
democratic body. Students’ opinions are ignored 
if there is no one there to voice them.

Of course, there is an impeachment pro-

cess. But it’s troubling that it occurs two-thirds 
through the term, allowing some to accrue 
more than double (some, sextuple) the limit of 
three unexcused absences before the issue’s even 
addressed. 

Further, the impeachment process is a 
byzantine method that often keeps abusers 
in power. After the advocate general submits 
impeachment notices for those over the limit, 
the council itself will vote on whether the mem-
ber will be impeached. Abusers tell sob stories 
to sympathetic friends to retroactively excuse 
themselves, and the council must reach a two-
thirds consensus to actually remove anyone 
from office. If somehow they get this far (and 
assuming they’re not absent), the A.S. Judicial 
Board will finally decide on their removal. 

Such a convoluted process ensures that most 
members will stay in office.  

And those are just the unexcused absences. 
A.S. members can have unlimited excused 
absences so long as a majority of the council

Beyoncé in BlackfaceQUICKTAKES

See ABSENCE, page 5

Last week, a photo of Beyoncé wearing dark face paint was published in the French fashion magazine L’Officiel Paris. Naturally, when the picture hit 
the web on Feb. 23, it immediately caused a firestorm in the United States. But 
regardless of how much heat the singer fields from bloggers nationwide, one 
thing’s important to remember: We aren’t the maga-
zine’s target audience.

The French, for whom the magazine was intend-
ed, pride themselves in their notion of republican-
ism — an idea that stresses that the French people 
are comprised of all citizens, regardless of ethnic 
background. For that reason, the French consider 
themselves a truly colorblind society; so colorblind, 
in fact, that it is illegal in France to collect data on 
the ethnicity and race of its citizens.

While many stateside point to the photo shoot as 
an offensive revival of blackface, the French — with-
out the context of Americas’s offensive 19th-century 
minstrel shows — see nothing more than a darkened 
face. There’s no doubt that a stunt like this would 
never have flown in America, a place stunted by 
taboo images and racial slurs. But the photo shoot 
was done in France, not here. And while many may fairly see Beyoncé’s deci-
sion to sport the darkened face makeup as a step too far, we must realize that, 
outside the context of American history, the image represents little more than 
an eye-catching magazine cover.

Earlier this month, Beyoncé was accused of looking “too white” for dyeing her hair blonde. Now, she’s being criticized for the opposite. The look — 
a nod to Fela Kuti, the Nigerian musician and human rights activist — not 
only skirts the racially charged history of minstrel-show blackface; it’s an 

expression of fashion at its controversial, boundary-pushing best.
True blackface first surfaced during 19th-century minstrel 

shows, which involved white actors blackening their faces with 
shoe paint or burnt cork and painting exaggerated red lips 
around their mouths so as to resemble circus clowns. Dressed 
in gaudy tailcoats, striped trousers and oversized hats, these 
actors portrayed offensive black caricatures for the entertain-
ment of a white audience. 

Though this type of blackface is clearly offensive, it is not a 
point of reference for this photo shoot. The “Single Ladies” sing-
er poses regally as an African queen wearing theatrical make-up 
and a vibrant animal-print dress that her mother designed. 

L’Officiel Paris is a high fashion magazine known for its 
envelope-pushing style. And in this case, Beyoncé was merely 
facilitating the expression of art by acting as a blank canvas. 
Her unique look was inspired by African rituals — not the 
cultural mockery of minstrel shows — and reflects, if anything, 

the African influence permeating current trends. It’s art, it’s high-fashion 
and in the end, it isn’t racist — plus, in the moribund world of print media, 
if a fashion editor can present a look that gets the web this atwitter, then all 
the more power to her.

oPINIoN MoNDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 2011 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 5 

approves them beforehand. While 
contesting the legitimacy of these 
excused absences is more trouble 
than it is worth, it is troubling to see, 
for example, that Biological Sciences 
Senator Daniel Liu has 35.5 excused 
absences. Or that Engineering 
Senator Adi Singer has 26. In total, 
this year’s council has racked up more 
than 300 excused absences. 

Article VI, Section 10 of the 
ASUCSD Constitution consid-
ers “failure to perform” duties an 
impeachable offense. It isn’t a stretch 
of the imagination to see that some-
one who hasn’t attended meetings all 
quarter, excused or not, is not repre-
senting the people who elected her.

All the more troubling is that 
many of these positions receive stu-

dent-funded stipends. Associate Vice 
Presidents receive $3,500 per year and 
vice presidents $5,250. In fact, over 
$70,000 of the A.S. budget is allocated 
toward stipends for the Senate and 
Cabinet. This is admittedly a paltry 
sum from a total budget over $3 mil-
lion, but if they don’t do their job, 
they don’t deserve to be paid.

Given an environment of absen-
teeism, it is important to commend 
those representatives that do fulfill 
their duty. Social Sciences Senator 
Rena Zuabi has had no unexcused 
absences and her first absence for just 
half a meeting was only two weeks 
ago. And President Wafa Ben Hassine 
has zero unexcused absences, and 
only two excused, a vast improve-
ment from when she qualified for 
impeachment last year.

Council should seek to amend 
the Constitution immediately to 
put a limit to excused absences and 
impeach those who cross the thresh-
old. Changing the vote from two-
thirds to simple majority may also 
make it easier to impeach members. 

Moreover, an independent body 
should be in charge of impeachment, 
not those who are thoroughly incen-
tivized to excuse absences. Stipends 
should be prorated so that those who 
miss meetings take a pay hit. When 
student leaders know there are no 
consequences of their delinquency, 
measures must be taken immediately 
to ensure that our elected representa-
tives represent the student voice.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
My name is James Carroll and I 

graduated from UCSD in the spring 
of 2010. 

As a junior at UCSD, I decided 
to try and improve the social scene 
at UCSD by creating a website: 
TheLBBsd.com. Originally, the site 
focused on dating for students at 
UCSD. However, as time went by, 
I realized that many of the site’s 
members were using the site simply 
to meet other college students. With 
that in mind, I decided to change 
focus, and my team and I have been 
working non-stop for the past three 
months on a site that is more in line 
with what San Diego college students 
are looking for in a social website.

Last week, the Little Black Book 
relaunched as TheLBB.com. The new 
site focuses on social introductions 
for students in San Diego. It is still 
exclusively for college students in 
San Diego (users must have a .edu 
e-mail address to join) and it is still 
free. It’s a great place to meet other 
college students at UCSD, San Diego 
State and University of San Diego. 

We had a few problems with 
previous versions of the site, but 
now TheLBB.com is completely rede-
signed, and the user experience is 
significantly improved. Although we 
encourage all of our users to expand 
their scene, TheLBB.com is now an 
awesome place to stay in contact 
with old friends, too. Some current 
users have also said it’s great because 
their mom isn’t on it, unlike some 
other social networking sites.

As a former UCSD student, I 
remember that the social scene could 
have always been a little better. I 
hope TheLBB.com helps make this 
happen.

F or all the administration’s best efforts, UCSD is full of remind-ers that we are first, last and foremost a science school. The Library Walk banners focus on our CEOs and Nobel Prize recipients — in chemistry, of course — and students are hard-pressed to come up with notable artistic alumni other than “the 
guy who wrote Kite Runner” (Khaled Hosseini), and actors Dileep Rao and 
Benicio del Toro. And del Toro never even graduated, opting to try his luck 
in New York City instead. 

Enter surrealist writer and alumnus Aimee Bender, the rallying point 
for alienated humanities majors from Sixth to Eleanor Roosevelt College. 
Bender, the daughter of a choreographer and psychoanalyst, arrived at 
UCSD in 1987 and left four years later with a degree in Literature/Writing, 
and experiences that incubated into the dream-like prose that has won her 
New York Times accolades, Haruki Murakami comparisons and numerous 
Pushcart Prizes. 

“My lover is experiencing reverse revolution,” says the main character 

in the opening lines of a story from Bender’s first collection, “The Girl in 
the Flammable Skirt.” Just last year, Jessica Alba played the main charac-
ter in a movie, “An Invisible Sign,” based on Bender’s book about a math 
teacher who knocks on wood to stave off her father’s death and eats soap 
to prevent herself from pursuing sexual relationships. Her latest novel, 
“The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake,” deals with young girls and food, 
but not via the ubiquitous eating disorder narrative — instead, nine-year-
old protagonist Rose Edelstein can literally taste the feelings of others 
through food. Every dinner becomes a struggle as she becomes privy to 
her mother’s affair and father’s unhappiness. 

“...and then I ended Up at Revelle aS One OF twO 
theatRe majORS...”

But before Bender became a writer whose fiction has been translated 
into 16 languages, before she even knew she wanted to be a writer, she 
made the same mistake that generations of UCSD students after her have 
made and will probably continue to make.

“I wasn’t the most decisive person when applying to college,” she said. 
“All I knew was I had a strong interest in theatre and I checked the boxes 
about which college without researching them. Then I ended up at Revelle 
as one of two theatre majors at freshman orientation. I thought it would be 
easy to switch colleges. It was so hard to switch that I never did.”

While the concept of a 
glowing peptide sounds 
like the lab gimmick of a 
fun professor, this technol-
ogy could very well change 
the way surgeons perform 
surgery. Scientists at UCSD 
have discovered an innova-

tive way to label the nerves of 
a surgical site, and these fluores-

cent-labeled peptides are illuminat-
ing a path to safer surgery. 
Nerve damage is a potential risk that 

comes with most surgery, and can cause 
anything from severe pain to paralysis. But 
with new breakthroughs in the develop-
ment of these fluorescent-labeled peptides, 
glowing nerve cells might be the answer to 
nerve-damage prevention.

Until now, preventing nerve damage 

has largely hinged on a surgeon’s individual 
abilities, as well as a method called electro-
myographic monitoring (or using electrical 
currents to detect and identify motor nerve 
cells). But even with electromyographic tech-
nology, the potential of damaging sensory 
nerve cells can be significant.

“In surgeries treating prostate cancer and 
erectile dysfunction, the risks can run as high 
as 30 percent,” assistant professor of head and 
neck surgery of the UCSD Department of 
Surgery Dr. Quyen T. Nguyen said.

But with a new method developed by 
the UCSD School of Medicine, that could all 
change soon. Fluorescent-peptide technology 
uses a phage, a type of virus, to identify a very 
specific type of peptide that has a closer affin-
ity to nerve cells. The identified peptides are 
then injected in the site of surgery, where they 
bind with nerve cells to create a visual contrast 
that makes them much easier to identify.

By making the nerve cells glow, a surgeon 
would be able to easily identify the location of 
the nerve cells, making accidental cell dam-
age less likely. The glow could also be used in 
nerve cells that have already been damaged to 

prevent further damage, as long as the cells 
have a steady blood supply. 

This method of preventing nerve damage 
is the first of its kind. According to Nguyen, 
marking nerve cells has never been done for 
clinical purposes before.

The new technology is closely related to a 
study conducted by both Nguyen and Nobel 
Prize Winner Dr. Roger Tsien, where they 
used fluorescent dye to mark cancer cells in 
rats. The earlier study examined the effects of 
the fluorescent peptide protein on cancer cells 
(the hope was to make them more visible).

While the new dyeing methods have 
worked on rats, the technology has yet to 
be tested on human subjects.  According 
to Nguyen, after passing pre-clinical trials 
through the FDA, the peptides could soon 
be used to identify nerve tissue and assist 
surgeons in resecting tumors more precisely 
and to preserve vascular and lymphatic tissue.

 Nguyen is confident that the peptides will 
fare well under scrutiny. “This is a short pep-
tide consisting of amino acids — there should 
be no inherent foreseeable risk.”

INFOCUS Marshallpalooza preseNts gastrotrucks

This past Friday, Thurgood Marshall College’s 
Marshallpalooza committee hosted the first-ever Winter 
Quarter event “The Best of Gastrotrucks” (also known as 
food trucks, roach coaches and grease trucks) – an evening 
of the best of San Diego’s mobile cuisine. Marshall students 
received free food vouchers for nosh from five local street 
vendors: Tabe BBQ, Corner Cupcakes, Devilicious comfort 
food, Flippin Pizza and Food Junkies (the Korean BBQ was a 
student favorite, drawing the most impressive turnout.) 

Unfortunately, due to the anticipated heavy rain, live 
entertainment was cancelled (The Evergreens were origi-

nally scheduled to perform); music was instead provided by 
an event planner’s iPod and followed up by a screening of 
TMTV’s movie “Crushed.” Not that the weather conditions 
affected turnout — committee members estimate close to 800 
students, faculty and staff participated in the event.  The eve-
ning started at 5 p.m. and attendance peaked around 6 p.m., 
slowly dying down through 9 p.m.

be a humanities major in, Bender said that her 
exposure to more science-minded classmates 
provided a welcome contrast to her own inter-
ests. 

“I lived with these kind of sci-
ence and rocker guys who taught 
me how to play guitar, and we’d take 
our guitars to the cliffs and that was 
just very San Diego, very beauti-
ful,” she said. “I loved being around 
science-minded people, maybe 
because I wasn’t really one of them.”

This influence would later 
show up in Bender’s first novel, 
“An Invisible Sign of My Own,” 
which features the aforementioned 
wood-knocking and soap-eating 
math teacher. There usually exists 
a schism between humanities and 
science, leading many writers to 
develop a phobia of numbers, but 
Bender believes fiction is a word 
problem of sorts, and that writing 
is a “math problem on the page,” because the 
process of developing plot lines is akin to work-
ing out a logical equation that must balance out. 

Although Bender remained involved with 
theatre throughout college —  it still tops the 
list of her strongest UCSD influences —  she 
changed her major to creative writing in her 
sophomore year. 

“I wanted to be an actress when I was 
younger, hence the theatre major, but I figured 
out pretty quickly that I’m terrible at it —  the 
switch was because I think I was enjoying my 
playwriting classes and wanted to be doing 
more fiction,” she said. “It was just a natural 
move to then take more workshops based in the 
English department.” 

“...a lIttle pIeCe OF new YORk On a 
la jOlla CampUS...”

Bender hasn’t been influenced by UCSD 
quite as overtly as Rao — we won’t be reading 
about any Geisel-shaped snow fortresses in 
her books — but the first publication to accept 
her stories was none other than a campus liter-
ary journal, the forerunner of today’s Mania 
Magazine. 

“I’d never thought of myself as a writer 
before,” she said. “I knew I wanted to write, but 

I kind of kept it on the back burner and [getting 
published by the journal] was very encourag-
ing.” 

And our conversation is still peppered with 
questions about whether her old hangout spots 

are still around. 
The results are mixed. New 

students still complain about 
her former homes, Argo Hall 
and Matthews apartments, 
when comparing them with 
the grandeur that is I-House. 
Groundwork Books and Price 
Center (which was completed 
while she was a student) are still 
standing strong and some of her 
favorite teachers, like Professor 
Emeritus of literature, Fanny 
Howe. 

But just last spring, A.S. 
Council shut down Grove Caffe, 
once Bender’s choice lunch spot. 
And most importantly, the tiny 
409 theatre that served as a cru-

cible of undergraduate art is long gone. 
“Every Friday night there would be a 10 

o’clock student-run show in the 409 theatre and 
I saw so many of those — it was enormously 
influential for my way of thinking, a little piece 
of New York on a La Jolla campus,” she said. 

Bender can still pinpoint the exact play that 
made her rethink writing and performance. The 
play, an experimental two-part Caryl Churchill 
piece called “Cloud 9,” skips from colonial 
Africa to 1979 London with actors playing dif-
ferent roles in the each act to bring home the 
themes of colonialism and oppression across 
time.

“I saw an incredible Caryl Churchill [play, 
“Cloud 9,”] at Mandell Weiss theatre, and the 
writing was so compelling and it took some 
risks —  it had a huge impact on me and my 
writing,” she said. “She wrote her plays based 
on the improv of the actors, and I remember 
seeing that and being awestruck. Those plays, 
those kind of surreal ideas, they were a huge 
influence.”

 “...I’ve alReadY dOne mY Own 
wRItIng, SO I Feel ReadY tO gIve tO 
OtheRS...”

After graduation, Bender applied to a variety 

of MFA programs. After being rejected across 
the board, she decided to teach elementary 
school for a few years before reapplying, and 
then decided to attend the UC Irvine MFA 
program, which has turned out writers such as 
Pulitzer Prize-winner Michael Chabon, Alice 
Sebold and Helena MariaViramontes. There, 
she started writing everyday, literally in the 
closet. 

“I liked the idea of going into the closet 
as a kind of entry into the world of child-
hood’s shadowy scary places,” she said in July 
2010 interview with literary journal Failbetter. 
Instead of a repression (going in the closet), it’d 
be an unearthing (what’s hiding in the closet?). 
It was dusty, and I wrote in there for a shocking 
almost three years.”

Today, as a professor of creative writing at 
USC, her writing area is more spacious but her 
schedule is no less strict. 

“I write for two hours every morning before 
going to work, so I’ve already done what is really 
important personally when I show up to teach,” 
she said. “I’ve already done my own writing, so 
feel ready to give to other people.”

Bender’s influences range from realistic writ-
ers like J.D. Salinger and Flannery O’Connor to 
pioneers of magical realism like Gabriel Garcia 
Marquez. But her most frequent comparison 
has been to Japanese author Haruki Murakami, 
also one of her favorites.

“For some reason, the choice that [Murakami 
is] making, it feels so right to him, so 100 per-
cent behind the strangeness that you just accept 
it no matter how strange it gets and it’s an amaz-
ing experience, it’s like you’re dreaming with 
him,” she said. “For myself, I will have ideas that 
feel a little bit thin and it won’t go anywhere 
and that’ll let me know that there’s not a kind of 
charge or feeling to that idea and I’ll just drop 
it. And I’ll just start a lot of different lines, and 
somewhere one of them will catch me, and I 
think those ideas are the ones that have more 
meat behind them.”

“I wRIte a SentenCe I ReallY lIke. 
then, I want tO wRIte anOtheR Sen-
tenCe I ReallY lIke.”

As a graduate of a creative writing pro-
gram and creative writing program, Bender is 
very much a product of the American MFA 
system. Amongst the ever-present controversy 

over whether good writing can taught, she 
comes down firmly on the side that it cannot 
— but that misconceptions about writing can be 
eliminated. 

“I do not think writing can be taught,” she 
said. “The best writing is the one that’s not over-
ly crafted. I write a sentence I really like. Then, I 
want to write another sentence that I really like.”

But, she says, creative writing programs help 
loosen the blocks students often have about 
writing and help to guide them to their own 
voice. 

“There’s so much pain for some people in 
writing, but none of that is actually writing, it’s 
the agony around writing, which every writer 
has,” she said. “And it’s certainly normal, but it’s 
separate from writing itself, and I think then the 
challenge for me as a teacher is to clear some of 
that away. Let’s pull out that torment and stop 
trying to get everything right and get to the 
place where you’re just experiencing something 
about language on the page.”

For aspiring writers, she tells them not to 
“write what they know,” but write what they 
want to write, without worrying about genre 
or praise or greatness. The advice is expected 
from someone who has strayed from writing 
about conventionally accepted “literary” topics, 
such as dysfunctional family sagas a la Jeffrey 
Eugenides and Jonathan Franzen. 

“I think there’s a lot of worry about what 
makes a story literary or what a makes a story 
serious and people can put on a false front 
instead of really trying to jump into whatever 
they actually want to write about,” she said. “Try 
to think about what that person really wants to 
write about and what really truly interests you.”

Bender has come a long way from her days 
lying on the hump outside the Old Student 
Center. 

“I remember this guy in workshop and he 
said to me, ‘Sometimes I sit on my bed and just 
shake thinking about the future,’” she said. “So 
that’s my memory of being an undergrad — so 
worried for the future, just like everyone else.”

By pairing detailed digitizing technology with a library of 1,000 
brains from local donors, scientists at UCSD’s Brain Observatory 
are working to create the most in-depth look at the human brain 
the world has yet seen.

The ten-year plan jumpstarted with a close study of Henry G. 
Molaison – referred to by the scientific community as H.M. – a 
high-profile amnesiac patient who donated his brain to the obser-
vatory following his death in 2008. The digitization and mapping 
of H.M’s brain is a project that’s being expanded into the extensive 
Digital Brain Library through a 10-year program that hopes to 
examine 1,000 brains, using state-of-the-art technology to look at 
each brain on a microscopic level. 

“What we’re hoping to create is basically like a Library of 
Congress for human brains — a collection that will eventually 
expose the differences between individuals’ brains,” neuroanato-
mist and head of the UCSD Brain Observatory Jacopo Annese said.

The study consists of dividing the brain of each donor into 
3,000 hair-thin slices and mounting the slices on glass slides. Using 
high-powered microscopes, each slide will be digitized, storing the 
information into 1 trillion terabytes of memory per brain. 

The end result is an extremely detailed, three-dimensional pro-

file. With this information, the scientists behind the Digital Brain 
Library hope to learn more about what each brain reveals about 
its owner.

“With each brain we’re getting a basic description of what these 
people were doing in life,” Annese said. “What we want to see is the 
difference between the brain of a painter and the brain of a guitar 
player.”

Traditionally, studies on the brain are conducted through MRIs 
— non-invasive scans that allow a scientist to study a subject’s brain 
while it’s actively working. While the MRI is a powerful diagnostic 
tool, the scans don’t yield enough detail to explore minute differ-
ences, which is where detailed images of the Digital Brain Library 
will come in handy. Each donor receives an MRI scan beforehand, 
and after the donor’s brain has been digitized, the information 
gained through the detailed neurological examination will help 
scientists better understand what the images of an MRI actually 
mean. The MRI image can be compared with the actual brain of 
the donor, and this comparison would indicate what certain images 
in an MRI reveal about the brain from a closer, neurological point 
of view.

According to Annese, the personal approach distinguishes this 
study.

 “This is less medical, and more humanistic,” Annese said. “I’m 
not just interested in what the human brain looks like — I’m more 
interested in what your brain looks like.”

Although the Comprehensive Kidney Stone Center at UCSD is 

the only institution of its kind in Southern California, even the cen-
ter’s founder was thrown off by a request he received early last year.

Dr. Roger Sur, Assistant Professor of Kidney Stone Surgery and 
Director of UCSD’s new Comprehensive Kidney Stone Center, 
received a phone call from the directors at SeaWorld, asking him to 
operate on a 450-pound dolphin.  

Sur’s non-invasive, robot-assisted kidney stone surgery has 
helped him operate on over 1,000 patients (human patients, that is) 
and is the reason why UCSD is one of the global leaders in treating 
kidney stones.

“Older techniques traditionally have used open surgery or 
sound waves to treat kidney stones,” Sur said. “But we’ve been 
exploring robotic options, where we use a robot to remove the 
stones. It has technology that’s state of the art and above and beyond 
the technology that’s out there.”

The techniques allow specialists to tackle larger, trickier kidney 
stones that the average urologist would be hesitant to take on. 

“The skill sets needed to treat certain kidney stones can be kind 
of challenging. But for us, there isn’t a kidney stone that we can’t 
remove,” Sur said. “We’re able to offer advanced surgical techniques 
that are not available anywhere else.”

Without making any incisions in the patient’s body, the non-

invasive method inserts a thin instrument through the urethra, and 
after locating the stone, either removes it with forceps, or uses a 
laser to break up the stone.  This state-of-art method of treatment 
also saved Sur’s most unlikely patient: Dottie, the SeaWorld dolphin 
that was suffering from deadly kidney stones.

“It does speak about the value of our technology, that it can be 
applied to another mammal,” Sur said.

Under Sur’s directorship, the urologists also do everything in 
their power to make a patient’s first kidney treatment their last.

“One of the problems with kidney stones is that the chance 
of recurrence is 50 percent, and if you don’t isolate the cause, the 
patients will just be coming back, “ he said. “But after we treat a 
kidney stone, we also look at the stone, and do a comprehensive 
metabolic evaluation, perform blood and urine tests, and basically 
analyze why the patient formed a kidney stone. In 97 percent of 
cases, we can isolate an abnormality that is the cause of the kidney 
stone.” 

Already a leader in treating kidney stones, Sur said that the 
center is conducting research to further develop urologists’ under-
standing. Sur’s particularly interested in exploring the link between 
kidney stones and cardiovascular disease.

“Most kidney stone patients share the same clinical profile as 
heart patients, such as weight issues, hypertension and high choles-
terol. It’s not a stretch of the imagination to say they’re connected,” 
he said.

Currently, Sur is collaborating with other institutions to research 
the causes of kidney stones, with an eye toward prevention.

“If we can better understand why people form stones and pre-
vent them, we can tackle a disease that’s increasing throughout the 
United States and probably the world.”

SPORTS MONDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 2011 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 11 

PUBLIC   NOTICE
The University of California, San Diego (UCSD) proposes to adopt a 
Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) for the Central Research Services 
Facility (CRSF) and George Palade Laboratory Expansion (GPLE) Project.  
The proposed project encompasses the construction of the CRSF and a 
minor expansion/renovation of the George Palade Laboratory building.  

The CRSF would be located on an approximately 0.8-acre site in the 
southwestern portion of the School of Medicine (SOM) on the west 
campus, north of La Jolla Village Drive and east of Gilman Drive within 
Parking Lot P604.  The proposed GPLE component would be located in and 
adjacent to the George Palade Laboratory building, which is located at the 
northwest corner of the SOM on the west campus, approximately 1,200 
feet from the proposed CRSF project site and east of Gilman Drive.  
Currently, sanitation services are inefficiently distributed throughout the 
campus and these decentralized sites consume large quantities of water, 
steam and electricity.  In an effort to consolidate existing sanitation facilities, 
conserve natural resources and modernize spatial allocation throughout 
the campus, the proposed project would employ sanitation and 
sterilization activities in a central, standalone facility (CRSF) and liberate 
additional space for research (GPLE).  The CRSF would be a three story, 
40,000 gross square-foot (GSF) building and would include sanitation 
service operations on the ground floor, as well as general office and 
administration space on the second and third floors.  The GPLE entails 
renovation of approximately 1,000 GSF of the existing basement to provide 
additional research support space and the addition of approximately 1,800 
GSF to provide research, procedure and support space.    

Based on an Initial Study (IS) prepared for the project, it has been 
determined that the project will not have a significant effect on                         
the environment that cannot be mitigated.  Therefore, a MND will be issued. 
Copies of the tiered IS/MND may be viewed at 
http://physicalplanning.ucsd.edu/environmental/pub_notice.html   
or by contacting the UCSD Physical Planning Office, 9500 Gilman Drive, La 
Jolla, California 92093-0074, (858) 534-6515. The public review period for 
the tiered IS/MND will extend through March 28, 2011. Any comments 
regarding the project or the IS/MND should be directed to the UCSD 
Physical Planning Office at the above address.

rebounds, while sophomore guard Emily Osga and 
freshman forward Erin Dautremont both contrib-
uted 10 points on the night. The Tritons pulled out 
in front of Cal State San Bernardino early, sinking 
seven of their first nine shots to collect a lead that 
would put the game out of the Coyotes’ reach.

“In its entirety, our game against [San 
Bernardino] was probably our best game this 
season, since we were able to put together a solid 
40 minutes of play with no let-downs.” Osga said. 
“We got our momentum back after our ugly loss 
against Pomona and are ready for post-season play 
and carrying over the same energy that we had last 
night.”

The Tritons will face off against Chico State 
this Tuesday, March 1 at 7 p.m. in RIMAC Arena. 
UCSD has beaten the Wildcats twice this season, 
but Elliott said the Tritons look forward to a battle 
Tuesday night and throughout the postseason.

“Now it’s 0-0 for everyone and we are excited 
to get another game in RIMAC,” Elliott said.  We 
definitely need everyone out there to help us get 
through a tough Chico team.”

and six blocks.
The Tritons came back Friday night, but 

had a tougher time against BYU. Set scores 
were 25-17, 25-16 and 25-22, with BYU 
hitting .460 with 38 kills and nine errors in 
63 attempts. UCSD hit .276, and no player 
reached higher than nine kills. Freshman 
setter Mike Brunsting hit the highest on the 
team with .714, and also got six kills. Service 
errors were down as the teams traded points 
with each other, committing 15 errors each.

“We were playing the number two 
team in the country on their court,” Ring 
said. “And we were pretty competitive. We 
stretched to a fifth game last night so they 
came out very focused.”

The Tritons once again lost the first two 
games, but showed some signs of life in the 
third set.

“We just got ourselves into a hole early 
on in the first two games,” Ring said. “You’ve 
got to put yourself in the position to win, 
and tonight we only did that in one out of 
three games, and we still came up short, but 
we need to put play all our games like we did 
in game three tonight.”

The Tritons come home to RIMAC 
Arena this weekend to play Pacific on Friday, 
March 4, and Stanford on Saturday, March 5. 
Both games are at 7 p.m.

couldn’t pull out those games. Disappointing, 
yes — but at the same time I feel good about 
our effort and what it took to get to that 
point.”

UCSD trailed by as many as 13 points 
in the first half, but started chipping away at 
the Coyote lead, and went into the half down 
38-31. The Tritons got within one point 
three times in the second half, but could 
never take the lead. A layup by senior guard 
Casey Ryan with 2:06 remaining brought the 
score to 69-68, but the Coyotes scored four 
straight points to gain a five-point advantage. 
Ryan made two free throws with 13 seconds 
remaining, and two missed free throws by 
the Broncos gave the Tritons a chance to tie 
the game with the score 75-72. But McCann’s 
three-pointer rimmed out and the Coyotes 
held on for the win.

 Ryan had 17 points and eight rebounds 
to lead the Tritons, and McCann, Justin 
Brue and Tyler McGrath all scored in double 
figures. Robbie Robinson paced the Coyotes 
with 17 points, although San Bernardino had 
five players in double figures. 

The Tritons suffered a lot of frustration 
this season, and had many opportunities to 
win games that slipped away.

“It’s hard for me to pin it on one thing for 
every situation,” Carlson said. “For a number 

of our situations we had the ball at the end of 
the game and couldn’t make a shot. For a cou-
ple of them we didn’t make free throws down 
the stretch. There’s a couple times when we 
didn’t get the rebound we needed, and there’s 
a couple times when we just didn’t execute.”

Midway through the season, the Tritons 
stood at 9-7 overall, but lost two games by 
a total of three points to Pomona and San 
Bernardino and only won twice for the rest 
of the season.

“I always think back to that Pomona/
San Bernardino weekend as a very impact-
ful weekend for us,” Calrson said. “ I really 
feel that if things had gone differently in that 
weekend, it would have propelled us to a dif-
ferent plane.”

But Ryan is the only graduating senior, 
and with a young team Carlson says he is 
optimistic that they can turn the close losses 
into wins.

“I’ve been proud of our effort,” Carlson 
said. “Its tough night in and night out in this 
league. Going forward, we have to take care 
of those things that we can control: making 
free throws, blocking out. And some of it is 
just learning how to win, which we’re going 
to do.”

UCSD Track Opens 2011 Campaign
By Liam Rose
Sports Editor

TRACK & FIELD — The UCSD track and field 
team got its 2011 season off to a strong start on 
Saturday, winning seven events at the 15th annual 
Rossi Relays hosted by Claremont-Mudd-Scripps. 

The early-season meet featured mostly 
Division-III schools, as well as some of the USC 
team. In a cold weekend for Southern California, 
the meet also featured a small amount of snowfall. 

“It was really great to get started,” men’s head 
coach Tony Salerno said. “I think some of the 
marks were down just because of the cold, but we 
still had some good stuff.”

The day’s biggest performance was undoubted-
ly from redshirt senior Danielle Thu, who won the 
hammer throw with a mark of 193’4”. It was Thu’s 
first appearance since winning the national title in 
the event in the 2009 season, and the throw was 
enough for a NCAA automatic qualifying mark.

“I guess I shouldn’t be surprised by anything she 
does anymore,” Salerno said. “Coming back and 
throwing that far in her first meet back is pretty 
amazing.”

UCSD had a good day in the field events, 
with victories by Stephanie LeFever and Theresa 
Richards. LeFever finished first in the long jump 

with a leap of 19’ — a provisional qualifying mark 
— and placed second in the 100-meter hurdles. 
Richards won the javelin throw with a mark of 
129’9”, over five feet better than sophomore Jessica 
Miklaski’s second-place throw of 123’8”.

Senior Kelly Fogarty — the defending confer-
ence champion in the 100-meter dash — blew away 
the competition with a time of 12.00 seconds. Her 
time was good for an NCAA provisional qualifying 
mark. Teammate Kathleen Hitchens was second in 
the event with a time of 12.77 seconds.

UCSD won the 4x100-meter relay with a time 
of 47.73 seconds, as well as the 1600-meter medley 
in 4:11.12. 

On the men’s side, senior Jesse Morrill took 
first in the 3000 meters with a time of 8:41.49. Alex 
Corliss came in third in the event with a time of 
8:52.33.

“It’s an odd regulation distance for NCAA, but 
it’s good to see him out there and winning,” Salerno 
said. “If I had to highlight one of the guys, it would 
definitely be Jesse.”

The Tritons will return home to host the San 
Diego Collegiate Challenge on Saturday, March 5. 
Field events begin at noon, while running events 
will start at 1:05 p.m.

MEN’S BASKETBALL — The UCSD men’s 
basketball team ended its season with a pair 
of losses, falling 63-50 to Cal Poly Pomona on 
Thursday before suffering a tight 76-72 loss to Cal 
State San Bernardino on Friday. 

The Tritons finish the season 11-17 overall and 
6-16 in conference play, putting them in 11th place 
in the conference standings. UCSD finished the 
season by losing its last three games, and dropping 
six of its last seven.

Against Pomona, the defending national 
champion Broncos shot 49 percent from the field, 

including 62.5 percent in the first half. Pomona 
went into the break with a 33-19 advantage, and 
never led by less than seven the rest of the way.

Tobias Jahn, Pomona’s German-born center, 
led the Broncos with a game-high 15 points on 
7-for-9 shooting. Freshman point guard James 
McCann led the Tritons with 12 points, while 
junior center Christian Hatch added 10 points and 
five rebounds.

After a layup for the opening basket gave the 
Tritons the lead, Pomona led the entire game.

Against San Bernardino, the Tritons dropped 
another close game, making it the eighth game this 
year in which they lost by five points or less. 

“It shows how competitive we were,” head 
coach Chris Carlson said. “It’s unfortunate we 

UCSD Splits Last Two

The UCSD women’s basketball team ended its regular season by splitting the last two games on the road. On 
Thursday, the Tritons suffered a 60-51 loss 
to second-seed Cal Poly Pomona, while on 
Friday the Tritons traveled to Cal State San 
Bernardino to cap their season by blowing 
out the Coyotes 76-50.

The Tritons’ 17-5 conference record 
secured UCSD the third seed in the CCAA 
playoffs and a home game in the first 
round. But by dropping the game against 
Cal Poly Pomona, the Tritons lost their 
chance to challenge the Broncos for the 
second seed in the conference tourna-
ment.

UCSD arrived at Cal Poly Pomona on 

Thursday with a lot of momentum, enter-
ing the match ranked No. 9 in the West 
Region while also riding an eight-game 
winning streak. But Pomona — the only 
team in the CCAA that managed to beat 
the Tritons in both of their conference 
match-ups — came out hot, going on a 7-0 
run to start the game. 

UCSD rallied to cut the deficit, tying 
the game at nine with 12 minutes remain-
ing in the first half.  But from there, subpar 
shooting from the Tritons and outstanding 
play from the league’s top-scorer Reyana 
Colson won the game for the Broncos.

Junior guard Chelsea Carlisle had 
another tremendous performance for 
UCSD, playing the entire game for the 

Tritons while recording 19 points and four 
assists. Junior center Lauren Freidenberg 
chipped in nine points and eight rebounds, 
but without much help from the rest of the 
squad, it just wasn’t enough.

Bronco guard Colson — who aver-
ages 21 points a game — finished with 26 
points on the night off 12-of-24 shooting. 
She was helped by guard Sarah Semenero’s 
18 points, who also went 4-of-8 from 
behind the arc.

“Honestly, we played back on our heels 
against Pomona and didn’t take care of 
business,” head coach Charity Elliott said. 
“But I was really proud of how we bounced

TriTons ready For PosTseason

TrITONS FINISH DISAPPOINTING SEASON
By Hanna Rahimi

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL — The UCSD men’s 
volleyball team took on No. 2 Brigham Young 
University on the Cougars’ home court for 
two matches this weekend, putting up a fierce 
fight only to lose 3-2 on Thursday, and getting 
swept 3-0 on Friday.

BYU took Thursday’s game with set scores 
of 25-22, 25-21, 23-25, 29-31 and 15-12. The 
Cougars hit .308 and the Tritons hit .298 for 
the game. Service errors were high for both 
teams, with UCSD coming in at 23 to BYU’s 
26.

“We didn’t play poorly; we put up decent 
offensive numbers, but we just didn’t pressure 
them enough,” head coach Kevin Ring said. 
“But I’m pretty proud of how hard we fought; 
we were down two games to zero and we got 
ourselves into a fifth game, and our goal is to 
give ourselves those kinds of chances.”

Down two sets to none, the Tritons showed 
their fight in the third game, hitting .417 to 
the Cougars’ .273 and with only one error.

“We had to get them out of system and 
we started doing that in game three,” Ring 
said. “We blocked a bunch of balls after that, 
slowed up their offense, and played better 
defense behind it.”

The Tritons brought the momentum of 
game three through to game four. With 17 
ties and seven lead changes, the team was 
able to challenge BYU to a 31-point set. The 
Tritons finally won the set, and in so doing 
forced a fifth.

 “They had a couple of serves at match 
point, and to win it, they would have had to 
side out so we had to come back with a good 
play,” Ring said.

Game five was a letdown for the Tritons. 
Some early service errors gave the match 
to BYU, making the Cougars the only cur-
rent Mountain Pacific Sports Federation 
team UCSD hasn’t beaten. Despite the loss, 
Thursday marked the first time the Tritons 
ever won more than one set against BYU.

Sophomore outside hitter Carl Eberts and 
Freshman middle Sebastian Brady earned 
career highs in the match, with 17 and 15 
kills, respectively. Brady hit .591 and added 
an ace and four blocks. Senior outside hitter 
Joel Davidson got 15 kills, senior setter Phil 
Bannan tallied 52 assists and seven blocks and 
senior middle Calvin Ross showed six kills Brian Yip/Guardian file

The Tritons pushed No. 2 BYU to five games on Thursday 
night, but fell in three sets the next night in Provo, Utah. See M. VOLLEYBALL, page 11See M. BASKETBALL, page 11

SEASON WRAP UP
UCSD finished the season 11-17 and 6-16 in 
the CCAA, putting the team in 11th place in the 
conference standings. However, little separates 
this team for its actual final standing and a team 
that makes the CCAA tournament, as the team 
lost eight games by five points or less. What the 
Tritons really lacked this season was someone to 
take the final shot. The Triton offense was always 
patient, and made up for a lack of outside shoot-
ing ability with excellent shot selection. But this 
really hurt the Tritons when time was running 
out, and their only consistent shooter — sopho-
more Tyler McGrath — could be covered by a tall-
er and faster defender.  Freshman James McCann 
showed flashes of ability in the clutch, and, along 
with several of the other young Triton starters will 
be a real threat for the Tritons in years to come. 
This year, however, heartbreak and disappoint-
ment haunted a Triton season full of  “so close.”

UCsd Falls to no. 2 Brigham young

Senior Casey Ryan had 17 points in his last game as a Triton.
