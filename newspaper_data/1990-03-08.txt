Atkinson Addresses Audience 

Ground Broken For New 
UCSD Thornton Hospital 
By CHRI STEINS 
raffWrirer 

The groundbreaking ceremony for 
UCSD' new Thornton Hospital took place 
yesterday afternoon, attended by more than 
300 fa ulty, taff, community members, and 
tudent . 

The UC Regents approved the construc-
tion of the new hospital in 1988 as part of the 
UCSD health care system. The new ho pital 
i expected to be completed in 1992ataco t 
of 65 million, according to NarH.':y Stringer, 
a UCSD Medical Center .spokes per on. 

According to Stringer, the ho pital will 
be located east of the main campu , acros1' 
from Inter tate 5. She added that the facility 
will be the fir t step in the construction of a 
new health complex on the 40-acre ite, and 
will include the Pearlman Ambulatory Care 
Center and the Shiley Eye Center. 

The 120-bed hospital will be operated as 
part of the larger UCSD Medical Center, 
which is located in Hillcrest. According to 
Stringer, the new hospital will allow more 
space for offices and re earch at the crowded 
Medical Center, which currently accommo-
dates 459 beds, according to information 
provided by the Medical Center. 

"The d velopment of the East Campus i 
beginning ... and the Thornton Ho pital is 
the keystone for opening this area up," said 
Chancellor Richard Atkin on, who wa one 
of seven speakers at the ceremony. 

The hospital is named for John and Sally 
Thornton, who donated $5 million toward 
its construction. John Thornton is a graduate 

of Pomona College and the Harvard Gradu-
ate School of Bu iness, and is currently 
directing a numberofhigh technology firms 
in the San Diego area. 

Sally Thornton, a published author with 
an undergraduate and master's degree in 
history from the University of San Diego, 
serve as chair of the Medical Center Plan-
ning Board and a director of the UCSD 
Cancer Center Foundation.

NATO Political Affairs Official Speaks 
To Students and Faculty On Campus 
By SHERRY LOWRANCE 
Guardian Reponer 

German Ambassador Henning 
Wegener, assistant secretary 
general for political affairs for the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion, spoke yesterday to a lunch-
eon audience here of about 70 
students, faculty , and community 
member on NATO 's changing 
role in Europe. 

The pre entation was spon-
sored by the Institute on Global 
Conflict and Cooperation (IGCC), 
a research organization funded 
bytheUCwhkhlltudie thecau e 
of international conflict and how 
to minimize it. 

Wegener aidhewa plea ed 
with the recent "v ictory of 
democracy and the demi e of 
repressive regimes" in Europe. 

TheSoviet Union is currently 
experiencing "total systemic 
failure," he aid, and becau e of 
this, the ecurity needs of Eu-
rope are changing. Military 
might can no longer ubjugate 
Europe, and thus the role of 
military power in Europe is 
diminished, he aid. 

Wegener aid it is tiII "theo-
retically pos ible" forthe Soviet 
Union to invade Europe; how-
ever, in a practical ense, an at-
tack is almo t impossible. 

"The disintegration of the 
War aw Pact is almo t com-
plete," Wegener explained. 

If the Soviet Union were to 
attack NATO member nation , 
it could not count on the upport 
of Eastern European forces, he 

aid. 
According to Wegener, the 

need for military security ha 
sub ided, and the need for sta-
bility has taken its place. Thi 
redefinition of security in Eu-
rope includes both a military 
a pect and a political a pect, he 
aid. 

Wegener explained that in-
stead of providing a defen e 
again t an unlikely attack, 
NATO 's pre ence should pro-
vide long-term military stabil -
ity. This tability can be ac-
complished by a bilateral re-
duction in military force to a 
lower, Ie s provoking level , he 
aid. 

Wegener al 0 feel that the 
prolife ration of dangerou 
arm , u ed to destablize devel-
oping countrie, uch as nu-
clear or chemical weapon , 
must be topped. The political 

dimen ion of security in ludes 
"overcoming the divisions of 
Europe" and encouraging the 
Soviet Union to be more con-
ciliatory, he aid. 

Wegener asserted that much 
work needs to be done in the 
area of arms control. 

Arms need to be reduced to 
a more manageable level, and 
once that i accompli hed, arms 
control agreements hould be 
carefully managed. he aid. 
Wegener added that the reduc-
tion of arms cannot be so dra -
tic as to jeopardize Europe's 
tability. NATO mu t till 

"provide reas urance" to Eu-
rope, he aid. 

According to Wegener, the 
afety net of nuclear tability L' 
till needed in Europe. The 

number of nuclear weapon 
mu t be greatly reduced, but a

UCSC Students Stage Sit-In To 
Protest Possible Ethnic Study Cuts 

SANTA CRUZ- Approximately 200 UCSC stu-
dents staged an all-night sit-in outside the offices of the 
academic vice chancellor Tue day night, demanding 
pennanent funding for ethnic studies programs. 

A Tuesday afternoon "Rally Against Hate" protest-
ing recent racist, sexist, and homophobic outbursts on 
the UCSC campus led to the demonstration. A UC Stu-
dent Association representative made a speech indicat-
ing that a decision was going to be made by Academic 
Vice Chancellor Michael Tanner regarding cuts in eth-
nic studies funding at the university. According to Phil 
Collum, the chairman of the Budget and Legislation 
Committee ofthe UCSC Student Union Assembly, this 
speech led to a march on Tanner's office. 

"A lot of the group wanted to talk to Tanner. It was 
completely unplanned, and by the time [the students) got 
there, at 4 p.m ., Tanner was gone," Collum said. 

According to Collum, the group decided to stay in the 
large foyer between the McHenry Library and the of-
fices of the chancellor and vice chancellor to compile a 
list of demands to be given to Tanner. 

Tanner met with the students at 7 a.m. yesterday, and 
said that he agreed to maintain the $44,000 set for ethnic 
studies funding in 1990-91, according to the Sama Cruz 
Independem. 

"I have never had any intention of cutting ethnic 
studies," Tanner said, adding that he was Â·'working ... to 
see that ethnic studies stays on an even footing." 

Tanner did agree to hold forum-style "monthly 
meetings" with student, and indicated that funding 
could not be cut back in the futu re because "most ethnic 
tudies courses are taught by tenured faculty." 

American Studies Lecturer Marge Frantz did not 
concur, claiming that most ethnic studies courses are 
funded with "soft money," funding that must be re-
viewed and renewed from year to year. 

At press time Wednesday night, the group of students 
was planning to spend another night in the foyer, despite 
possible arrest by the police, according to Collum. 

''The students are planning on staying there until 
Tanner gives them a two-hour block of time to speak 
with him, and until he guarantees permanent fundmg for 
ethnic studies," he said.

UCSB Basketball Victory Leads To 
Destruction, Fire, and 'Extinction' 

SANTA BARBARA- Chunks of debris and smol-
dering pile of burned furniture cluttered the streets of 
Isla Vista Feb. 27, the remnants of a celebration that fol-
lowed the UCSB basketball team's winoverthe Univer-
sity of Nevada, Las Vegas. 

For tWQ hours after the game, firefighters battled 10 
dump ter fires, numerous couch burnings, and a blazing 
IS-foot paper-mache dinosaur which was quickly ren-
dered "extinct," a fITe department official said. 

Doused dumpsters were repeatedly reignited by 
overzealous celebrants, but the threat was "minimized" 
because the dumpsters were pushed into the street, away 
from trees, power lines, and automobiles. 

One police officer was struck by a flying beer can, and 
a fire truck was assaulted by numerous flying objects, but 
there were no injuries reponed. 

"This is the best town in America," student John 
Bruning said, gazing at the crackling garbage dumpster 
and the intoxicated UCSB fans dancing around it.

This marks the first time Watson has acted against a 
UCB recommendation, according to UCB vice chair 
Paul Eykamp. 

In a Feb. 23 letter to the co-ops, University Center Di-
rector Jim Carruthers offered the co-ops a version of the 
contract not authorized by the UCB. The letter state that 
if the contract is not signed by March 9, " the proces 
noted in previous correspondance will be initiated." 

The process, as outlined in a Dec. 5 leiter from Car-
ruthers , includes a " transition to new student opera-
tions." The co-ops say that they consider this phrase a 
euphemism for eviction .

"The opportunity awaits to 
embark on a new era of peace and

John Ruggie, UCSD professor

Wegener's appearance was ex-
tremely "timely." 

As a German fonnerly involved

have the Spring Festi val for Peace 
made into a permanent UCSD 
event, similar to the annual Sun 
God Festival. 

"I would like to see a commit-
tee created witha Festival for Peace 
chair and an independent budget 
for it every year like the Sun God 
Festival receives. That way the 
event will become institutional-
ized, a part of the student activi-
ties," Judaken said. 

The A.S. also allocated $1,000 
from General Unallocated to the 
NativeAmerican Student Alliance 
(NASA) for an Awareness Day. 
The fund s will go toward a 

speaker's honorarium. The speaker 
has yet to be named. 

NASA is the first on-campus 
Native American suppon group to 
exist at UCSD in five years, ac-
cording to Karen Makkreel, budg-
etary contact of NASA. 

Makkreel said the Awareness 
Day program will include danc-
ing, authentic Native American 
food, a display of Native Ameri-
can art from the reservations, and 
local anists. 

"At the end of the day we hope 
to have Wilma Mankiller [speak), 
who is the first female leader of the 
Cherokee Nation," he said. 

The tentative date for the 

Awareness Day is May 24. 
The A.S. also allocated $1 ,165 

from the General Unallocated 
funds to send Iwo members of the 
as yet unopened Student Credit 
Union to the Student Credit Union 
National Conference. The money 
will cover four days of food, lodg-
ing, transponation, and airfare for 
two. 

"It is really important to send us 
to this conference because we will 
talk with other students about Stu-
dent Credit Union operation prob-
lems and problem solving," said 
Adam Remis, the chair of the

The Pro-Choice 'Forum' 

A Litany of Failures 
The Pro-Choice Forum last Friday was clearly political. 

Everyone knows it. State Senator Lucy Killea knew it when she 
said the forum was a "very important undertaking." The event's 
organizers, UCSD Students for Pro-Choice, knew it. The AS. 
Judicial Board knew it when it recommended that the event be 
delayed. And AS. Advisor Randy Woodard knew it was politi-
cal, and he knew that the AS. Council probably violated its 
constitution when it voted to fund the event. 

The "Forum" - the name was changed from "Rally" to make 
it seem less politically charged - only had speakers who were 
in favor of legal abortion . This was not a forum: it was not an 

exchange of differing points of view. It was an attempt to 
energize the student population, and make it aware of this impor-
tant issue. This may be an admirable goal, but there are problems 
with it: first, such an event is clearly political and one-sided, and 
second, it is controversial and should not. be paid for with student 
fees. 

Those are some of the reasons the A.S. Constitution prohibits 
funding of political events; the A.S. is supposed to be neutral on 
such issues, and despite occasional forays into foreign policy, the 
reason the AS. exists is to promote the student interest. It is not 
in the interest of students to have their money spent promoting 
one political point of view over o thers, particularly concerning 
such a powerful issue. Nor is it truly educati0!1~ to have a 
political rally which presents a narrow point of view. It may 
excite the already convened, but it does nothing to clarify a 
cloudy and divisive ethical issue. 

It is not important whether the event was pro-choice or pro-
life. What is important is that the event should not have been 
funded, the Judicial Board should have taken quick action on the 
issue, and Woodard should not have told the group to go ahead 
with the event. 

It's not entirely clear what Woodard did tell the group to do. 
According to an account from one of the event's organizers, he 
"told us to basically disregard everything the Judicial Board 
said." According to Woodard, he told them to "Proceed if they 
wanted, and that would be fine. But I also said to be prepared for 
the Judicial Board to sustain its ruling." 

But after the event was held, it became largely academic what 
the Judicial Board ruled. Woodard should have acted in the 
interest of all the students, and in accordance with the Judicial 
Board recommendation, advised that the event be postponed. 

The Judicial Board's slow and stumbling approach to the issue 
also exacerbated the problem. The Board was largely unin-
formed about the event, and though Chair Evan Kirvin said the 
event was "clearly an overt political event," the Board spent a 
long time discuss ing the i!.s!.Ie, and finally decided to delay ruling 
and ask meekly (and ineffectually) that the event be postponed . 

The misguided actions by Woodard, the JudiCial Board, the 
AS., and the UC 'D Students for ProÂ· Choice created a messy 
situat ion . The event was politIcal, and thl~ organi/.ers should have 
been forced to ::.eek a s urce of fundtng other than the pockeb of 
students. The " Forum" 'hould not have taken place with A .. 
funding. 

Student Issues: TGIFs, Co-ops and Trees 
Editor: 

I am writing to discuss three 
issues dear to every student' s heart: 
TGIFs, the co-ops, and trees on 
campus. 

There has been a great deal of 
misinfonnation (ormiscommuni-
cation) as to what the main con-
cerns have been and the process 
by which they have been addressed 
with regard to the TGs. 

Although many issues have 
been rai ' ed, the main issue is vari-
ety. It is not a culturally sensitive 
issue, nor is my goal to diversify 
the TGs to reflect the diversity at 
UCSD. It is simply to encompass 
an even greater variety of enter-
tainment. 

In the Opinion section of the 
Feb. 5 Guardian. David Burkhart 
tates, "Last year's refrain of 'not 

another reggae band!' has disap-
peared." To me this suggests that 
many believed there was little 
variety last year. When an attempt 
to show some variety was made, 
many were pleased. So one can at 
least understand, if not agree with, 
students asking to encompass an 
even greater spectrum of enter-
tainment. 

If you can understand the is-
sue, then it becomes easy to see 
why one of my favorite groups, 
Living Colour, would not fit into 
this attempt for even greater vari-
ety. The color or gender of the 
performer is irrelevant; what 
matters is the type of music. And 
it is certainly not a combination of 
these. Although variety was the 
main topic, I apologize for any 
miscommunication that may have 
ocurred with anyone. 

I would also like to make it 
clearthat I never "ran to an admin-
istrator." After our first agreement, 
whichoccurredlastJune(between 
Matt [Schnurer 1 and I), students, 
staff, and administrators on both 
sides approached us. Some im-
plied that they would slow down 
the agreement made, others how 
they would speed it up. 

As more and more groups 
wanted to play a part, including 
theGuardian Opinion section, this 
issue of variety was blowlI out of 
proportion, causing rumors and 
frustrations for all. In no way did 
I want to change the basic premise 

of TGs, just to broaden and 
strengthen it. 

Mr. Schnurer has been very 
committed to his work of provid-
ing high quality bands at rela-
tively low prices. And now that a 
numberof things have been clari-
fied, we are (finally) both satis-
fied. 

There is one other concern 
indirectly related to this i sue, and 
itdeals with the accusations made 
about Vanness Harris by some 
Guardian articles. He has been 
accused of making statements and 
acting in certain ways in three 
different articles (two editorial 
and one news article), but was 
never contacted by any of the e 
writers. Unfortunately, this cre-
ated even further confusion as to 
what was going on. 

For example, in the Opinion 
section of the March 1 Guardian 
edition, it states, "In a program-
ming committee meeting, Van-
ness Harris accused another black 
student, Kim Phillips, of 'know-
ing nothing of her culture' ... " The 
editorial suggests that this was 
fact. 

In the other article, Mr. Harris 
allegedly said something and it 
was even in quotes. Mr. Harris 

has since addre ed th is issue, but 
the March I article poses certain 
ethical question since no attempt 
was made to contact him. 

A second-and unrelated is-
sue-<leals with the future of the 
co-ops. Lease agreements are of-
ten long and tiis3greements are 
nonnal. 

The co-ops and the University 
Center Board agreed on a lease 
proposal; however, the admini-
stration may not accept parts ofit. 

Worst of all, if no agreement 
has been reached by March 9 and 
the co-ops do not sign the lease 
agreement, eviction may take 
place. It is an issue of student 
control over student fee-funded 
facilities. 

The third issue that I would 
like to bring to your attention has 
to do with the Central Library ex-
pansion which will take place 
during Spring Break. It is esti-
mated that some 240 trees will be 
knocked down. 

It is an issue that has recently 
reached the surface, so it is uncer-
tain whether or not 240 new trees 
will be placed throughout cam-
pus. Immediate attention is 
needed.

An A.S. Battle of Male Egos 
Editor: 

Nothing is more surprising than to pick up acopy of the Guardian and 
to see your name in a letter to the editor. It is overwhelming when it 
happens more than once. Since I feel that no one knows better than I as 
to how I feel, then it is only right that r have my say. 

First of all, I seriously wondered whether or not I should write this 
letter. However, it seems that the only way anyone can even hope to get 
their point across to Mr. Vanness Harris or to Mr. Matt Schnurer is to in 
fact write a letter. I hope to make this the last of my involvement in what 
) have come to think of as the "battle of the male egos." 

Let's face it, guys. You 're both wrong, but not completely. Maybe 
when you both realize this, you will stop with the accusations and 
actually start to talk, and even more importantly 10 lislen, to each olher. 

You both have a lot to learn. You both say that you know a greal deal 
about people, or at least you act as if you do. Obviously you do not. I am 
a person, yet it seems 10 me that neither one of you seems to know much 
about me. Alas, il seems that I have forgotten that this is the "battle of 
the male egos." As a female, I must not count. Matt. ifI had wanted my 
life in the newspaper, I could have told the Guardian staff myself. 
Vanness, how do you know how I feel? Did you ask me? 

Until this silliness has stOpped, I feel that my presence at future A.S. 
Programming meetings is unnecessary. I am tired of being a pawn.

Trivial and Juvenile Student Government Politics The Naming of 
Third College 

Editor: 
Oh man. [ thought that I had run into 

shoddy, pretentious small-town politic 
when I worked in a small city. But Ihen I 
came here and ran into even more trivial, 
juvenile, and overblown student govern-
ment politics. 

Oh, and don ' t forget our equally prestig-
ious administration. which is just as gUilty 
of participating and bullying in this farce 
we call representation; all of it geared 
towards bowing to the whims and pressures 
of the minority of students. It is in situations 
like this that it becomes pennissible to 
shove selected culture down our throats. 
(Gee. shouldn't we be allowed to vote for 
the culture that we prefer?) 

The truly sad thing about the whole 
situation is that I know that the vast major-
ity of students are more than satisfied with 
the talent which has been presented at TGs. 
I know if/But it is vividly apparent that with 
the prevalence of gutless and self-se~ing 
politics running rampant, that it's much 
easier to follow the wishes of the vocal 
minority than those of the passive majority. 

The student community ofUCSD is sick 
of petty politics interfering with every facet 
of student life imaginable. But golly, the 
TG presents such a wonderful opportunity 
to prove that our student government is so 
socially responsible. especially since the 
rest of us are blind sheep being rounded up 
and sent straight to the cultural slaughter-

house without their guidance. 
Well, ) hate to say it, but TGs are just 

concerts; free concerts provided for anyone 
who wants to lislen, dance, drink, or simply 
unwind after a week of acting like they 
were studying. To assume that it is the 
perfect opportunity to provide students with 
cultural messages is ludicrous and conde-
scending. 

Matt Schnurer has done an unbelievable 
job of turning the whole idea ofTGs around, 
fighting to keep them alive and wet, provid-
ing some of the coolest bands around to 
perfonn for us, and keeping politics out of 
it. 

How many people remember when TGs 
featured the Cardiff Reefers followed by 
the Paladins, then Borracho Y Loco, then 
the Paladins, then the Reefers (for locals), 
with a brief respite provided by Mango 
Bang? (Who?) I guess we could return to 
the diversity of those days. 

Then all of a sudden, Mary 's Danish, 
Fetchin ' Bones, Mojo Nixon, 24-7 Spys. 
Syd Straw; all of them playing for free at 
our school! My God,real bands! Real bands! 
But no, it can't be true. It's too good to be 
true. These bands aren't cultural enough. 
they ' re too popular. 

So Matt, let me say on behalf of all those 
who agree with me, thank you. Thanks for 
fighting this silly losing battle against our 
visibly out-of-touch representatives. Thanks 
for providing some well-needed meaning-

less entertainment in a community that takes 
itself and everything el e too seriously. 
And thanks for providing some of the cool-
est, and may I add, most diverse bands that 
have ever played on the gym steps. 

It 's just a matter of time before the 
student government. with the support of the 
administration. will find some other issue 
to politicize; surely some other form of stu-
dent entertainment is lacking in vital social 
sermons. I know I still can' t distinguish 
right from wrong without the help of my 
student government. In fact, I'm afraid to 
graduate. What willi do without them? 

By the way, I like funk, punk, classical, 
jazz, calypso, and some reggae. and I didn ' t 
learn any of it from going to TGs.

Fighting Words? 
Editor: 

In regards to "Egotistical Morons 
at Muir," (March 5), we have a ques-
tion: Does the expression "The truth 
is that Muir women are sleazy and 
Muir men are assholes" constitute a 
violation ofthe Fighting Words Pol-
icy? If so, whom do we sue? Enquir-
ing minds want to know. 

Dale McGrew 
Curtis Taylor 

Editor: 
Cecil Lytle wishes to change the 

name of Third College. He shall have 
his way. And students at this college, 
which proclaims itself "An Exciting 
Choice," have none. 

There will be no election. For, 
despite a stunning prose defense of 
autocracy in the face of apathetic 
masses, what Cecil Lytle desires is 
not certain turnout, but certain change. 
And fickle democracy can provide 
no such guarantee. 

And so fickle democracy is tossed 
aside. And requests for votes are 
replaced with requests for opinion 
papers. And Third College, regard-
less of the official name chosen, 
becomes Cecil Lytle College. 

If you read this Mr. Lytle, I im-
plore you, do not respond to me as 
you have to so many others, with 
elegant justifications of your ends 
and means tastefully stamped with 
the official College seal. I do not 
want a letter from you, nor do I want 
an audience. I only want a ballot.

Nicaragua Editorial Was Inaccurate 
Editor: 
The Guardian's edjtorial supporting the 

Chamorro victory in Nicaragua is about as accu-
rate as a Nazi report on the Warsaw ghetto upris-
ing would have been. It places Nicaragua in an 
East-West context when it squarely belongs in a 
North-South context. 

The Nicaraguan Revolutjon is not a struggle to 
instituteaRu sian-style communist society, but a 

r lived in Nicaragua for five years, beginning 
in 1983, four of those years as a teacher in the 
nominally neutral American School in Managua. 
Many of my Nicaraguan colleagues were part of 
the opposition, organizing teachers and doctors, 
working with opposition parties and unions, In 
fact, one of the members of the board of directors 
was arrested for working for the CIA. I w iUlessed 
a construction worker's hunger strike demandi ng 

The Nicaraguan Revolution is not a struggle to 
institute a RUSSian-style communist society, but a 
struggle for social justice and national dignity. 

struggle for social justice and national dignity. 
The third o f the arable land that Somoza had 
greedily acquired was given out to campesinos 
without land. National izalion of the banks and the 
export trade is designed to avoid a repeat of 
Somoza's Nicaragua or neighboring EI Salvador, 
where a handful of fami lies become rich while the 
vast majority remains impoverished. Lastly, a 
diversification in trade was vigorously pursued so 
as to pennit the country not to have to constantly 
kiss Uncle Sam's foot and swear to the aJmjghty 
dollar as so many of their neighbors are required 
to do. 

With a trickle of aid to rebuHd the country after 
the massive destruction by SOffiOza (his last act 
before fleejng with a fortune of perttaps $4 bil-
lion, was to bomb any factories still intact), and 
then later, the $i billion destruction by the U.S. 
frnanced and directed by the Contra army, the 
Sanrunistas never got the economy to the critical 
mass needed for investors to have any confidence 
in it. 

wage bcreases. The police cordoned off the area 
and were selective about who they let in and out. 
I also visited resettlement centers forcampesinos 
forcibly removed from farms located in war zones. 
Hence, I witnessed much of the repression re-
ferred to in the editorial. 

However, considering the magnitude of the 
war they were fighting, the amount of repression 
was remarkably little. The great majority of the 
civilian deaths have come at the hands of the 
Contras, who routinely attacked villages with 
heavy artillery and who have no prisoners. They 
have all been long executed. 

The editorial board's evident adoption of 
Jeanne Kirkpatrick's theory of authoritarian ver-
sus totalitarian regimes is particularly upsetting. 
This theory "justifies" the butchering of all who 
advocate a just and democratic society in EI 
Salvador and the attempted dismantling of a 
movement based on just such principles in Nica-
ragua.

Eating Disorders 
Seven of 25 Counseling Services 
at UCSD Combat the Behavior 
â¢ Story By Ramine Bahrambegi 
Guardian Reporter 

Eating disorders are serious conditions 
of self-destructive behavior that are ex-
pressed through two fOlms of the condi-
tion: anorexia nervosa and bulimia. Ano-
rexia i a form of sel -induced starvation. 
Bulimia is characterized by binge-eating 
followed by purging via vomiting, laxa-
tives, or through exercize. 

Both disorders are on the rise, with 
national rates currently as high as 12 per-
cent in young people between the ages of 
17 and 22. 

While college-age women are the prime 
targets, males are not excluded from these 
disorders, as an estimated five to 10 percent 
of all anorexia and bulimia cases are men. 

According to Beverly Harju, a UCSD 
counseling psychologist, seven out of 25 
counseling services at UCSD are dedicated 
to helping people with such disorders. 

The Recovering from Eating Disorders 
program, which is run by psychologists 
and student peers who themselves have 

overcome eating disorders, offers counsel-
ing to students who seek help. 

Harju said this interaction proves more 
effective since it helps students feel more 
comfortable. The program is divided into 
three levels, and is designed to help stu-
dents at various stages of the disorder 
through group therapy, follow-ups, and 
preventive counseling. 

Harju said there is no single cause for 
eating disorders. A combination of psycho-
logical, familial, socio-cultural and bio-
logical factors can be contributors. Society's 
emphasis on thinness puts great pressures 
on many to strive for a thinner body shape. 

Also, according to Peer Counselor Karen 
Bassiri, with rapid social changes, there is 
more and more pressure for women to 
become independent high achievers and 
succeed on male terms, getting important 
jobs and becoming self-reliant. 

While the same may be said about males, 
being fit athletically is the primary concem 
among males with eating disorders. 

According to the American College 

lUustratioll by Mel Marcelo 

Health Association (ACHA), anorexia ner-
vosa is a condition characterized by an in-
tense preoccupation with food, combined 
with an obsessive fear of becoming fat. 
Symptoms include: 

â¢ An intense preoccupation with the de-
sire to be thin 

â¢ Weight loss of at least 25 percent of 
original body weight with no medical expla-
nation that could account for it 

â¢ Excessive dieting and hyperactive ex-
ercise 

â¢ Cessation of menstruation (when 10 
percent ideal body weigh is lost, menstrua-
tion ceases) 

â¢ Chronic depression, low self-esteem, 
irregular sleeping pattems 

â¢ Hypothermia, because of the body's 
inability to maintain heat 

â¢ Constipation, becau~ theintestinal tract 
is disturbed by the fa: lure to take in and 
retain normal amounts of food and fluids 

â¢ Lack of concentration, and chronic fa-
tigue 

The ACHA said bulimia is known as the 
binge-purge syndrome. A bulimic person 
shows a pattem ofbinging and self-induced 
vomiting as well as abuse oflaxatives. 

Bulimics are not easily identifiable be-
cause they are not thin like anorexics and, in 
fact , are slightly above average weight. Some 
of the medical complications ariSing from 
bulimia include:

Taking Milk 
Crates is 
a Crime 
By LARRY SPEER 
Daily Nexus 

Mike Massey has chased crooks 
allover the state . He 's brought 
charges against criminal meat 
packers, a renegade tortilla chip 
producer, and has even nailed a 
few police officers who were 
unwittingly breaking the law. 

The crimes they committed 
were not cause for an FBI man-
hunt. Many of the "criminals" were 
not even aware they had done 
anything wrong. 

But Massey , a retired San Ber-
nardino police officer, was hot on 
the trail. He was a milk-crate cop. 

"Milk crates are everywhere," 
Massey said. "Just go to any col-
lege campus; students are using 
them for furniture, for shelves. 

"Drive down the freeway, and 
you won 't go for more than 10 
minutes without seeing some sort 
of truck with a crate or two in the 
back .... 

"Drive down your street, look-
ing into domestic garages, and 
there'll be some in there. It gets 
completely out of hand when you 
look into it." Massey said_ 

Americans, including many 
college students, steal more milk 
crates than almost anything else, 
said Massey, and dairy industry 
statistics would appear to back him 
up. From student space-crunchers 
to industrial cost-cutters to en-
trepreneurial interior decorators, it 
seems that almost everyone is steal-
ing the useful- and expensi ve-
plastic receptacles_ 

After retiring from police work, 
Massey, 45, worked from 1985 to 
1987 for the California Coalition 
for Milk Case Recovery, an or-
ganization formed by Califomia's 
biggest dairies to halt the rampant 
theft of their crates. The crates, 
registered and stamped by the 
member dairies, were disappear-
ing across California to the tune of 
$14 million per year . 

Massey 's job was to spread 
awareness among law enforcement 
agencies about a 1983 change in 
the penal code making all unauthor-
ized uses of registered milk crates 
illegal. In one instance, however, a 
police force was alegedly too busy 
breaking the law to enforce it, 
Massey said . 

The San Bernardino Sheriffs 
Department had made an arrest of 
a known petty thief, Massey said, 
and he had been asked to pick Ull 
26 stolen crates. 

"Now you golta realize cops 
love returning stolen property. It 
makes them feel like they 're doing 
their job," he said. 

But by the time Massey got to 
the station to pick up the crates, 
" the dam things had mostly disap-
peared." The station watch com-
mander himself had allegedly ab-
sconded with six or eight of the 

See CRATES, page 9 

Thursday, March 8, 1989 

Crates 
Continued from page 8 
stolen crates and was using them 
as a table for his personal com-
puter. 

" The law is in plain English on 
the crates," Massey said, "and yet 
people just don 't give a dam .... 
They ' re not milk cases to me; 
they're five dollar bills." 

Gil McGuire, Adhor Farms 
Dairy operations manager at the 
Southgate, Santa Ana, and San 
Diego plants, estimates 10 ses boost 
operating costs in his three plants 
by more than $100,000 per month. 

"These charges just go directly 
back to the consumer," causing at 
least a three to four cent price in-
crease on every gallon, McGuire 
said. 

The chief concern among the 
dairies is not the individual person 

with one or two crates, but the 
industrial users who use crates to 
sh~ve dollars from their operating 
costs_ 

Film production companies 
store electronic goods in milk crates 
when filming on location, rather 
than buying proper containers. 

Meat packers use the heavy, 
stackable crates for storage. A 
storage rental facility in San Diego 
had warehouses stacked with crates 
full of items the were being paid 
to store. But one of the strangest 
and most disgusting examples 
Massey has encountered was that 
of a homemade tortilla chip com-
pany in Escondido. 

Rather than buying the proper 
industrial deep-frying equipment, 
theowner used milk crates to deep-
fry his raw chips-by submerging 
the crates in vats of hot, bubbling 
oil, Massey said. When the crates 

The UCSD Guardian 

began to melt, he knew the chips 
wele done, Massey said, adding 
that the plast ic coati ng on the crates 
is toxic for human consumption. 

To the best recollection of Isla 
Vista Foot Patrol Administrative 
Assistant Diana Halliburton, there 
has never been a citation issued in 
Isla Vista for possession of stolen 
milk crates. 

While state law dictates a fine 
of up to $1,000 for illegal posses-
sion of milk crates, along with a 
possible jail term of up to six 
months, Halliburton said that 
"officer discretion" has been the 
reason that students with crates in 
their apanments have not been 
cited. 

"} don ' t mean to minimize the 
effects this has had on the diary 
industry , or on the pri ce of

Tritons Take 15 Swimmers, Two Divers to National ChampionshIp Meet 

WOlDen's Swimming Striving to Capture Crown 
By BRIAN ITOW 
Senior Staff W,iter 

For five years in a row, Kenyon 
College of Ohio has been the queen 
of women's swimming. It has been 
revered as th: best to ever float on 
Division III water. 

This year, the second-ranked 
UCSD women's swimming team 
will take 15 swimmers and two 
divers to the National Champion-
hip at Williams College of Mas-

sachuselts in an altempt to break 
Kenyon's hold on the Division III 
crown. 

The big question is: are the 
Tritons capable of doing it? 

UCSD Head Coach Bill Mor-
gan does not care to speculate, but 
all indications seem to point to the 
most competitive race in years. 

Two new stars and added depth 
give the Tritons as good a chance 
as they have ever had to win 
UCSD' s first NCAA Division III 
national championship in swim-
ming. 

These two stars are Catherine 
CapriJe"s and Sabrina Lum. Ac-
cording to Morgan, they will be the 
Tritons' main point-getters at the

petition, Darin Wessel was the 
only TritOfl to qualify for the 
nationals, with a second place 
finish in the sabre. 

Others placing included Avi 
Friedlich (fifth, sabre), Arnon 
Friedman (fourth, foil), and 
Amy Leung (13th , women's 
foil). 

The week before, the men's 
team posted second place fin-
ishes in the foil (14-2) and sabre 
(13-3), and fifth in the epee (8-
8) for second overall at the nine-
team conference tourney. 

The women 's team went 9-7 
in foil competition to place 
fourth.

event, in which she is currently 
ranked first in Division ITI. 

Capriles and Lum will also lead 
the Tritons ' top-ranked 200 and 
400 medley relay teams. 

In addition to the two top new-
comers, a number of veteran na-
tional s performers are being 
counted on to score points. 

Katy Arnold is expected to make 
it to the freestyle finals. l enna Ba-
na zek is a top contender in both 
the freestyle and butterfly events. 

Alice Kirby and Erin Bakey are 
expected to lead the Tritons in their 
respective breaststroke events. 

Morgan is excited about the 
prospects of his top performers, 
but believes that the second group 
oft 1 swimmers could be the key to 
Triton success. 

"We are going to Massachu-
setts with a lot of top scorers and a 
lot of question marks in the second 
group," he said. 

Kenyon is as vulnerable as it 
has been in the past fi ve years, 
according to Morgan, while the 
Tritons have the quality and depth 
to score more points than they ever 
have at a national meet.

Tritons Take Two For First Sweep of Season 
Softball Disposes of Regis of Colorado, 4-2, 6-1; UCSD Raises Record to 4-6 

By PETERKO 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD softball team may 
have forever changed the way 
teams break out of slumps. 

Change the uniform. 
Outfitted in shiny new digs, the 

Tritons wiped out Regis of Colo-
rado (3-7) yesterday afternoon, 4-
2 and 6-1, to record their first , and 
long-awaited, doubleheader sweep 
of the season. 

Plagued by inconsistency and 
mental lapses for much of its first 
eight garnes, UCSD transformed 
itself into a smooth-running ma-
chine that banged out 20 hits and 
10 runs in the two games. 

The Tritons (4-6) also played 
their first error-free game of the 
year in the opener, when they 
knocked off the Division II Rang-
ers, who are in the first year of their 
program. 

" I don't know who that team 
was in our uniforms for the first 
eight games, but it wasn't the team 
I saw today," first-year UCSD 
Head Coach Sal Coats said. 

Kathy Fogg (1-3) got the Tri-
tons off on the right foot by carry-
ing a no-hitter into the sixth inning 
of the first game, before Regis' 
Leta Hanson lined a single into left 
firld. 

Fogg, a junior, also helped her 
own cause by going 2 for 3 al the 
plate to pick up her first victory of 
the year. 

Fogg received offensive sup-
pon from banerymate Tracey Kehr, 
who went 2 for 3 with an RBI, and 
shortstop Dana Chaiken, who went 

2 for 4. 
Regis' Laura Picon (1-3) was 

knocked around for three runs in 
four innings to take the loss. 

First-year player Kim Stutzman 
(3-0) also went the distance in the 
nightcap to remain undefeated on 
the season. 

Stutzman, like Fogg, kept the 
Rangers off balance with an as-
sortment of off-speed pitches. Both 
pitchers recorded six strikeouts. 

Fogg continued to tear up the 
Rangers ' pitchers by pounding out 
another three hits, and teammate 
Lisa Mora went 3 for 3 to pace the 
Tritons' II -hit attack. 

In the bottom of the founh in-
ning, Kehr staked her claim to a 
part of UCSD softball history, as 
she became the first Triton to hit a 
home TWl at UCSO's second-year 
field. 

The run, which closed out the 
scoring, was only the second round-
tripper ever hit at the field. 

"As far at we ' re concerned, 
today was apening day," Coats 
said, re,arcInt the tearn 's hopes 
for a bnllfl!lllld from its early-
season prebl,IIlS. 

"We're sating off the season 
2-6, but in ~ minds, we're 2-0," 
Coats said.

men' s vo lleyball game against 
ninth-ranked Ball State University 
(15-5) is that UCSD players posted 
match-high numbers in kills and 
assists, and the Tritons out-killed 
their opponents 83-81 . 

The bad news is that despite 
these achievements, the Tritons still 
fell in straight sets 15-4, 15-12, 16-
1410 remain winless at 0-14. 

Captain Nate Brown pounded 

down 24 kills, and also had a team-
high .568 hitting percentage. 

First-year setter Matt Brega 
primed hitters with 65 assists, as 
Tom McCutchen and Lamson Lam 
took advantage for 15 and 13 kills, 
respectively. 

Brega boldly predicted Ihat the 
team would claim its first victory 
with an upset in tomorrow night's 
7 p.m. rematch with SDSU.

"J am not sure how we compare

try to swim as well as we can, and, 
if everyone one does that, then 
maybe we can beat them," she said.

Still, he insisted that beating

A guard In basketball today must be able to do almost anything for his squad. 
Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan are the prototypes. They can score, pass, 
rebound, block shots, steal balls and sell programs at halftime. They put people 
In the seats. Bryce Stafford may be as close as II gets here at UCSD. He led 
hiS squad In scoring, assists and steals , but most importantly brought the fans 
out to catch all the action. He can play the point guard, shooting guard or small 
forward position. Night after night he gave it l00"k and led his team to a top 
ranking and playoff birth.

Team Bowling Championships on the Make! 
It coutdn't come at a better time. With the rest ofthe campus agonizing over impending finals, a spirited 

(and we mean spirited, in the best sense) group ofUCSD students will be having a ball this Sunday evening. 
And oh yal They'll be rolling one tool 

Its the annual Intramural Team Bowling Championships, and the Clalremont Bowl will be busting at the 
seams as it has been for the past eight weeks. 

The top 3S qualifiers from this yc::.'s Sunday and Tuesday night teagues will be rolling for plenty of ego 
gratificat ion this Sunday evening at 9pm. The championship rules are cutthroat . Only the top four scores 
advance to Tuesday (March 13) Night's Rnal Four flnale. 

The bottom line Is simple. High handicap or not, you'd better be in the 1-3 pocket this Sunday, or your 
season Is over. No weak hearts need apply. Knock 'em all down, or go home and start studying for finals. 

This year's 35 qualifiers with season won-lost records: 

That Other Intramural Sport 

, Nicole Barr, Forward 

Well, another Hawaiian Football season has come 
and gone without much of the intramural population re-
alizing il was even here. If ever there was a sport that 
kept a low profile, it's this one. As far as exposure goes, 
it's the MISl, LPGA, and Pro Bowlers Tour all rolled into 
one. h's the kind of sport in which the most famous 
player could do one 01 those American Express 
commercials .. .'Hi, do you know me?' 

and scraps of trash. With no referees, no penalties, and no 
punts, the game takes on a playground, 'pick-up' atmosÂ· 
phere. It could be the only intramuraf sport in which rockÂ· 
paper'scissors plays a crucial rate in settling disputes. Jeez. 
I've seen more organization in a backyard game of 'pickle'. ' 7 Point Guards ' Womens, 'Jordan 's Heirs ' Coed AA 
T~ere are a number of outstanding players at thiS position, but lhis gal always 
stepped on the court ready to play and make a big impreSSion. She loves to get 
In the paint and mix It up WIth anyone who happens to be there. Down low IS 
where the action IS and where you'lI find thiS scrapy gal. This blue-<:oller 
approach Isn't always a work of art, but without her contributions neither of her 
squads would be cruising through the playoHs. Nicole hopes to take thiS 
valuable 1M expenence to the Women's Intercollegiate squad next year, but for 
this season she has left her mark on 1M's. 

Todd Sells, Forward 
'Swim Fags ' Men's A 
Called by hiS captain, 'A motivational leader,' thiS talented athlete lea~s his team 
in scorng both on and off the court. His athletic backgrDund is primarily in 
aquatics, but he can do it on land also. One of the few 'players' on this team of 
mutants he leads the team WIth an average of 16 points per game. His versatility 
allows him to fill the lane on the fast break or g' inside and push teammates out 
of the way 10 gel olfenslve boards. The strongest part of his game though, is the 
power move to the hole. When he takes off he is rarely denied:' 

Joe Higgins, Center 
'Miami Heat Red Shirts ' Men's AA 

But every Friday aftemoon you can be sure of two 
things happening on Muir campus (TG's are not one of 
them)-someone will be pounding on a Sparklens bottle 
by the Gym steps, and dozens of fleetÂ·footed athletes 
will be playing their own brand of football on Muir FISId. 
TG for these guys takes on an entirely new meaning-
Tons 0' Gatorade. 

In a word, the game is tiring. Remember the lastÂ· 
second kickoff retum in the StanfordÂ·Cal football game 
a few years back? Imagine running 30 of those plays 
back to back each half with no huddles. I don't know 
about you, but I'd rather be the Stanford trombone 
player than run with these boys. In fact, I yelled, 'Sub!' 
when they were just explaining the nuIes to me. 

The field boundaries are marked off by cones, but 
more appropriate markers might be sweatshirts, hats, 

In HaWaii, the game is usuaUy played on dried lava beds, 
where grass is sparse and craters of ~ to two feet deep score 
the surface. Perhaps this is why the game has adapted so well 
to UCSD, as Muir FISId is as close as you will come to these 
conditions on the mainland. In fact, the real treat about 
Hawaiian FootbaU is even if your team loses by 70, you're a 
winneri! you're able to walk off the field with both ankles intact. 

But with atl it's idiosyncrasies, Hawaiian Football errbodÂ· 
ies the unwritten code of intramurats in both competition and 
sporlsmanship. Despite the absenoe of officials, there are 
fewer controversies in this sport than in almost any other intraÂ· 
mural sport. 

Hawaiian Football is a way for this rare breed of Friday 
warriors to let off a little of the week's Sleam before they head 
overto the 'luau' on the Humpforacouple of Primos. But best 
0/ all, Hawaiian football is the only sport in which the champiÂ· 
ons get lei'd right after they win.

Joe is anything but your CIaSSlC center. He doesn't have a sky hook, isn't always 
the last one down the floor, and he can shoot outSide. He also gives 110%, all 
the time. Stiffs beat on him all game long trying to finally get a board away from 
him. but they are rarely successful. He Isalsooneol the rare players who doesn't 
try to chew up an offiCial every time he walks on the court. His deceptive drop 
step moves around the basket and fade away jumpers are what made him the 
teams leading scorer. ThiS big, active center was one of the best in IM's for the 
1990 season.

Triton rub Show 
Concert to Enhance Environment 

By Josh Odint% 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD Wilderness Club will be hosting a 
free environmental concert, titled the Mother 
Earth Day Fest, at the Triton Pub on March 10 at 
7 p.m. Bunji Thump, Jambay, and a light show 
will provide live entertainment, but the main 
focus of the event is to highlight visiting environ-
mental groups. 

Many local and national groups will have 
representatives at the show. The current list of 
groups involved include: Greenpeace, Earth First, 
Environmental Health Coalition, I Love a Clean 
San Diego, the Sierra Club, the Peace Resource 
Center, Green Store (affiliated with the San 
Diego Greens), the Rain Forrest Group, Jim Bell 
(alternative technologies), Project Earth, the San 
Diego Bio Diversity Project. CalPIRG, the Clean 
Air Coalition, and the Earth Day Coalition San 
Diego. 

In addition. many on-campus groups are join-
ing the festivities. Among groups that have 
expressed interest are the Gret:ns of UCSD, the 
Recycling Co-op, the Muir Environmental 
Community, the UCSD Earth Day Coalition, 
and the CM Cafe. 

In a recent interview, co-organizer Joe Rigney 
discussed how they went about recruiting organi-
zations to attend the show. "We came up with a 
few lists that people had of groups involved with 
environmental issues," Rigney said. "Essentially, 
we JUSt called around town asking them to come. 
W e wanted a wide variety of environmentalists." 

Some of the organizations, like Greenpeace 
and Earth First, are known for their controversial 
tactics, but they will still be part of the festivities. 
"All of these groups are controversial because 

they are environmental organizations," Rigney 
said. "One hundred years ago, the Sierra C lub was 
a very radical and progressive movement. and 
now they have gotten into the mainstream." 

The Wilderness Club is still recruiting group 
for the Mother Earth Festival. "If a group wants 
to come, they are more than welcome to do so. 
We'll make room for them as long as they notify 
us in advance." 

The event, although open to everyone, is 
aimed at a specific age group. "Our goal," stated 
Rigney, "is to have freshmen and sophomores 
who live on campus, that's who we are targeting 
with our advertising the most, come and talk to 
the people we have invited to find out how they 
can become involved in these issues and to find 
out what they can do. We are trying to highlight 
the positve aspects, that 'Yes, something can 
indeed be done.' All you have to do is go out and 
get involved." 

The Mother Earth Fest initially began as the 
brainchild of Rigney last spring, and the actual 
plans were laid out in the fall once the Wilderness 
Club restarted. The original idea was to throw a 
party, but then the idea of visiting environmental 
groups changed the focus of the event. 

"Initially, the idea was just to have a good 
time. Bur then we figured the Wilderness club 
has a responsibility to try to make it into some-
thing positive for the community," Rigney said. 

"The A.S. allotted us funds. so we were able to 
have this event absolutely free to the public." 
Rigney remarked. "W.:. want to get people to talk 
to these groups, and we didn' t want to exclude 
anyone from getting involved."

Surfacing with Success 
Murphy Dives Deep in Live Performance 

Last night at the California 
Theatre, ex- Bauhaus frontman Pe-
ter Murphy proved why he is often 
dubbed the thinnest performer in 
the music business. His puppet-
like antics, like a Jane Fonda on 
speed. entertained the audience 
for over an hour-and-a-half. 

Murphy has long been labeled 
the "father of gothic rock." The

image, the popular press has 
jumped onto the bandwagon. la-
belling him an "Eastern mystic" 
and a "philosopher." 

"They're all not quite right," 
Murphy laughed during a recent 
telephone interview. "TIle 'phi-
losopher' one is the best so far. But 
[the music] is causing interest, and 
any reaction is good." 

Regardless oflus tit le. the enig-
matic Murphy once again proved 
himself to be rock's premiere per-
formance artist. 

cool detachment while crooning 
the enthusiastic crowd into a hyp-
notic state. 

The sense of contrived theat-
rics was overwhelming through-
out the show. The word "improvi-
sational" did not come to mind. 

The show itself leaned more 
towards a theatrical production 
than a mere rock concert. Flucttl-
ating between a simplistic and a 
complex barrageoflight, Murphy's 
show utilized production possibili-
ties to an extreme. 

"[ think you can do more With 
one light on the hand and use that 
hand as a way of telling something. 
rather than spending $5 million 
on loads of lights that say nothing 
but hide the band' inadequacies." 
Murphy sa id. 

The sparse lighting, coupled 
with fog machines, effectively 
accentuated Murphy'. aqualme 
features, commanding charisma, 
and dramatic posturing. 

Repeatedly mimicking the 
album cover's pose , Murphy 
showed himself to be one of the 
most flexible people in the busi-
ness, if not the world. In between 
the herky-jerky shoulder motions 
and multiple pelvic thrusts. he 
often stared intensely off into 
space.

himself. Black was the night'S 
theme, both on-stage and off. 

"There aren't many blondes 
here tonight,"one leather-clad ob-
server notired . "That's a good 
thing. I think." The sense of the 
collective individual. with Murphy 
ruling over his subjects. was over-
whelmmg. 

MUSically, the show could stand 
up totally on itsown. The Hundred 
Men, the quartet who worked on 
Murphy's recent Beggars Banquet 
relea e Deep, proved that they are 
more than just crack studio musi-
cians. Thanks to a good soundman 
and true ta lent, the group added 
that extra bite necessary to 
Murphy's live performance. 

In contrast to the wall of sound 
and simplistic ideas of Bauhaus, 
Murphy's solo career has been a 
constant expansion of his natural 
sense of melody. With Deep, this 
keen sense has been honed with a 
new-found maturity previously 
lacking in Murphy's work . 

Although Murphycan't beclas-

si fied as a traditional musician, the 
album has a sense of lyrical ran-
domness that , juxtaposed against 
the highly textured aural land-
scapes, resu lts in highly powerful 
pieces. 

Perhaps one of the strongest 
cutS offof the album is "Roll Call," 
a catchy combination of throb-
bing drums. simple guitar TIffs, and 
nasal vocals remmiscent of his 
Bauhaus material. Within the

can easily get caught in socially ac-

McKay Steals Sculptors' Show 
By James Darlow 

Contributing Writer 

"Then marble, soften'd into life, 
grew wann," wrote author Alex-
ander Pope in the Second Book of 
Horace. 

Of all the sculptors feamred at 
the Mandeville Gallery's exhibit 
entitled "Seven Sculptors," it ap-
pears that only Los Angeles-based 
sculptor Yolande McKay listened 
to Pope's prophetic thought. 

At first glance the sink-like 
sculpmre, "Object ofYivification," 
invites one to read the imple, yet ' 
ominou inscription on the glass 
top: "Subject to Spontaneous 
Combustion." One steps away from 
the sculpture only to realize that 
on one side is a little chamber 
filled with red powder, while on 
the sculpture' other side the title 
of the work is imprinted into the 
cement. 

Not only does McKay's work 
stand out in the gallery, it also 
makes viewers question what ex-
actly is art. At this exhibit, McKay 
uses cement as a base for all of her 
works adding glass, pigment, ox-
ides, and soap-scum to compliment 
the cement's grey color. On top of 
that, the cement is buffed to the 
point where it looks and feels like 
marble. 

Moving from the cement sculp-
tures of Yolande McKay, the viewer 
next encounters the geometric 
sculptures of Carol Hepper. These 
sculptures srand out of the gallery 
wall inviting the viewer to get a 
better feeling for her work. 

Yolande McKay's Object of Vivication, on display at the Mandeville Gal/ery through March 25. 

Hepper, born and raised in 
North Dakota, incorporates pieces 

of wood and steel pipes to create a 
Yin-Yang representation of the 
simple country life and the mod-
em-day complexity in the big city. 

"Cleft" is made up of three sec-
tions of four-inch wall pipe con-

pealing sculpture. 
San Diego artist David 

Engbritson's displays catch the 
viewer's eye as unique and intrigu-
ing. Hanging from the ga llery ceil-
ing are two very interesting sculp-
tures, yet it is "Geocentric Still-
life" that attracts the most atten-
tion. This sculpture illustrates 
Engbritson's ability to work with 
metal, wood, and paint. 

The sculpture resembles a me-
dieval steel torch with a series of 
spikes runn ing down the three foot 
handle. To add to the sl;ulpture, 
Engbritson has pulled the 
sculpture's upper right-hand cor-
ner away from the wall, thus add-
ing more depth to the subject. as if 
it was suspended from the galler{ 
ceiling. 

New York artist Creighton 
Michael works with wood, acrylic, 
fiberglass, graphite, and linen to 
produce some of the more thought 
provoking sculptures at the "Seven 
Sculptors" exh ibit. The five-and-
a-halffoot tall "Draughon" stands 
out simply because it requires a few 
minutes of deep introspection to 
decide how to look at it. 

The sculpture, projecting into 
three different directions, creates 
a sense that life as we know it can 
easily exist in three dimensions no 
matter how different the dimen-
sions may be. 

Los Angeles and New York-
based sculptor Zizi Raymond takes 
objects from the everyday world 
and creates interesting v iews of 
life. Raymond depicts basic ob-
jects such as a small red bench 
("Untitled"), and an old red table 
hanging from the wall and steel 
wool pouring out of an overturned 
bottle. 

These symbols of normality in-
d icate that a Ithough the works may 
appear simple, they are in fact a 
statement about the rigors of eve-
ryday life. Raymond's "Secrets" 
must be experienced from all sides; 
yet it seems to illustrate the frailty 
and dangers of life and how they 
are tied to some of the things in life 
that are more sturdy and depend-
able. 

Montana art ist Michael Peed 
literally makes the viewer take a 
close look at his wood carvings. 
Peed uses the wood to bring forth 
the humor of realtife. This is most 
evident in the sculpture "Garden 
of the Gods" which depic ts a man 
and his daughter out for a drive in 
the Midwe t. The humor comes

Public Art in San Diego 

Bringing Art to the People 
By Christina Huizar 
Senior Staff Writer 

When an artist puts a piece of work out in the 
public view, a certain new element comes into 
play. No longer is the work protected by the four 
freshly painted white walls with the gallery's 
name embossed on the front wind w pane. 

Public art is now subjected to the same wear 
and tear as an old busstop bench. It is thrown out 
into the public where you average human being 
can regard and judge it. Here, public art is not 
reserved tor the pretentious art snob with a ll his 
theori (.S and degrees. 

San Diego, essentially artless for a city of its 
size, will place four works into the public domain. 
"Streetsites," put together by the Sushi Gallery, 
will run through April 7. 

This project will explore the idea of public 
spaces and social interaction with these public 
spaces. In its fifth year, the gallery is generally 
known for its strange an unusual performance 
art. 

"Streetsites" opposes these pre-existing fac-
tors. "Streetsites" came into order last fall when 
Sushi began submitting site-specific proposals of 
public art. A panel selected four pieces which 
were then commissioned by Sushi to make their 
sketches into concrete, free-standing objects. 

The first of the pieces is Larry Dumlao's "San 
Diego Reflecting Pools." The work, which can 
be viewed in the lobby of the San Diego National 
Bank in downtown San Diego on Kettner Blvd, 
addresses the realities of our shallow water re-
serves. 

Providing a poignant and educational visual 
image of the relationships between current/fu-

ture water requirements and actua l water sup-
plies, the process of water evaporation is present 
in the piece. 

A collaboration between three artists, Dan 
W asil, Susan Yamagata, and Todd Stands, en-
titled ":ArTM. :ArTM," is designed to renew 
and reaffirm a basic American right: the right to 
free speech. 

A replica of an ATM machine, this one dis-
penses not money, but copies of the First Amend-
ment and the historical documentation of cen-
sorship. This piece can be viewed at the San 
DiegoCommunityConcourse Plnzaon "c" street. 

Dave Engbritson's "Flock," placed in Pantoja 
Park, examines the symbols of contemporary 
wealth in juxtaposition to those that are more 
archetypal and prehistoric. 

The artist directs the viewer's attention to 
look at the value that is placed on things and 
objects which are inconsequential to our success 
as human beings. 

The last of the "Streetsites" projects is Seyed 
Alavi's piece, "Trompe 1 Oeil Columns." This 
piece is at the Sushi Gallery on Eighth Avenue 
in downtown San Diego. Alavi's work consists of 
16 floor-to-ceiling columns throughout the gal-
lery space, each made of recyclable newspapers. 

In addition, there are architectonic capitals 
and pedestals, creating a visual haiku. Alavi is 
trying to tempt the viewer's conceptual perspec-
tive, to inspire allegorical/symbolic questions 
and references. 

"Streetsites" will be up in their site-specific 
locations through April 7.

UCSD Hosts Symposium 
By Michael Schwartz 

taff Writer 
Tackling an immen ely com-

plicated i ue, the UCSD Theater 
Department recently hosted asym-
posium entitled "The Classic in 
Contemporary Theatre." 

Arrended by hundreds of ac-
claimed theater artist and schol-
ar , the conference featured a 
number of different panels. The 
meeting wa designed to addre â¢â¢ 
problem faced by theaters today 
m producing cla sical works. 

It has been said that the first 
step to fmdmg a solution is identi-
fying the problem. While no i ue 
were tied into tidy little solutions, 
rhe obstacles of Widespread pro-
duction were clearly defined. 

Complaints by those in :men-
dance ranged from a lack of g v-
ernment subSidies necessary for 
theaters to tay Out of the red, to 

the definition of what is a "clas-
sic." 

T he center of the three-day 
event was the keynote address by 
Jonathan Miller, a respected ac-
tor, director, and phy ician. ln his 
speech, "Survival of the Fittest," 
Dr. Miller grappled with th e issue 
of what makes a playa classic, and 
how it should be pre en ted. 

"I don't think anyone in the 
18th century had a clear cut view 
ofa work la tmg beyond their life-
time," Mtller said. 

In defense of hiS productions 
that drew critiCism for bemg un-
faithful to the originals despite 
mellculou research, Miller said, 
"We look at statues With the arms 
knocked off and we chensh their 
mutilated form. If someone were 
to reattach the arms the way it was

created, it would be vie wed a

Implyin g thar t hese same 
warped standards apply to the 
theater, Miller also defended large 
changes from the original works. 
"It is impossible to determine the 
in tentions of the author from 
examining only the text," Miller 
explained. "The autho r is not 
always the best authority as to these 
inten tion ." 

Miller's best moment came 
when, usi ng an analogy of history 
as a city, he referred to the present 
as "a sleazy sh opping mall- uburb 
of history" and moments later re-
ferred to critics as "small inverte-
brate parasites." 

The central problem of "what is 
a classic" was never resolved. In 
opposition to equating "classics" 
with Shakespearean work, propos-
als were brought forth to include 
everything from Euripides and So-
phocles ro Ibsen and Chekhov. 

Although no definite conelu-

A rather unconventional sug-
gestion was the modernizing of the 
language of many texts. After all, 
it was reasoned, why are we using 
translations from ancient lan-
guage into 19th century British , 
when we could be using version 

in the language we currently speak? 
In his address, Millcr sa id , "We 

have inherited works that have 
lasted long past each au thor's life. 
Time is so different now, there is a 
question of whether we should 
bring them alive again." 

ions were reached, the sympo-
Sium gave many people the oppor-
tUOlty to express their views on a 
wide variety of topical i ues.

Sculptors 
continued from page 4 
through in the little girl's glasses 
which Peed has painred with candy 
cane stripes. 

UCSD graduate Wade Saun-
ders' bronze work is based on one 
simple idea: marine life. The 
bronze on these small sculptures 
appears to have been allowed to 
age, thus giving it an ancient, frag-
ile appearance. 

Most of these 15 small sculp-
tures appear as if they had been 
excavated from an archaeological 
site on the sea floor, while some of 
the other sculptures appear a bit 
more terrestrial; ranging from a 
small wheel rim and bowls to what 
appear to be elaborate ashtrays. 

"Seven Sculptors," which runs 
through March 25 at the Man-
deville Gallery, is an excellent 
exhibit of some of America 's canÂ· 
temporary sculptors. 

It appears, at least from this ex-
hibit , that the dullness of cold 
marble is over, andthatthewarmth 
of more pl iable media is becoming 
a stepping stone for the artists of 
the '90s. 

Aborigine 
continued from page 5 
era I mystery. 

T he Aborigine "dream," the re-
lat ionsh ip to nature and the e â¢ 
sence of the Aborigine culture, 
culminates in the art with titles 
such as "Honey A ny Dreaming," 
"Lizard ," and "Bark Painting." 

The wood carvings of hzards, 
birds, and funeral totem poles 
represent the myste ri es of the 
Aborigine culture. 

This exhibit deviates from the 
generic art exh ibit. The art main -
tains the cultural identity, and is 
reminiscent of a more simplistic 
era in history. 

Conven ienrly located, t he

spective to those not familiar with

It is a pleasant way to spend IS

Chinese Food, La Jolla Style 
George E. Wong is a new addi-

tion to the diverse La Jolla restau-
rantrow. Located next to the Hard 
Rock Cafe on the comer of Pros-
pect and Fay, George E. Wong is 
the ideal spot to take the parents 
to lunch on the patio overlooking 
downtown La Jolla, or to have a 
pleasant evening for two that will 
not deplete your financial sources. 

Dim sum may conjure images of 
appetizers being pushed around in 
carts. Not so at George E. Wong. 
All items on the menu are freshly 
made to order, and no MSG 
(monosodium glutamate) is used 
in the preparation of the food. 

You may have to wait a few 
minutes longer for some items on 
the menu, but the food IS worth 
the time. 

The house specialties inelude 
Chinese chicken salad, cilamro-
laced Szechuan dumplings, and 
potato won tons which a re 
George's potato-filled variatiun of 
the traditional won ton. 

The menu has a selection of 
soups and salads that are served in 
generous proportions, as well as a 
variety cf dim sum. 

The menu offers a variety of 
fried I ice and chow mein dishes 
seasoned with soy and other spices 

By Tiffany Schubart 
Contributing Writer 

The roasted meats and house 
specialties are pleasant deviations 
from the C hinese norm of stir fry 
and white rice. The Szechuan 
chicken breast is asurprisinglyspicy 
twist on the American staple. 

The dim sum itans are either 
fried like traditional ege rolls or 
pot sticker style. DiJerent sauces 
accompany dim sum, raneing from 
hot mustard and Vietnamese red 
sauce to dUCK sauce, a sweet and 
sour dipping sauce. 

Overall, the menu offers some-
thing for everyone, of all different 
preferences. Every item on the 
menu is a delicious'difference from 
traditional Chinese. 

Forthosedinersover21,George 
E. Wong has a quality wine list 
with many wines offered by the 
glass as well as bottles. The selec-
tion of beer is reasonably priced, 
and has a variety of brands. Miller, 
Heineken, and Corona are offered 
as well as T sing Tao, Sapporo, and 
Kirin . 

Of course sake can also be 
purchased by the shot or the glass. 
A full bar will soon be incorpo-
rated in the restaurant for those 
diners who prefer mixed drinks 
with their meal.

They Might Be Successful 
Musically, They Might Be 

Giants have been described as 
everything from cowpunk to 
artrock. 

They may bedifficult tocate-
gorize, but everyone agrees that 
their whimsical brand of upbeat 
music is one that leaves listen-
ers with smiles on their faces. 

They Might Be Giants, 
which consis ts of John 
Flansburgh (guitar, vocals) and 
John Linnel (accordian, vocals), 
began in the mid -80s in 
Brooklyn. 

They have had two indepen. 
dant label releases, but their lat-
est release on Elektra, Flood, has 
established them in the major 
leagues without compromising 
the unique style that made them 
popular on the underground 
scene. 

\.. 

Flansburgh and Linnel had 
been friends in high school, but 
didn't Start the band until later. 
They released their first cassette 
on their own, which caught the 
attention of the recently formed 
Bar/None Records indie label. 

After their debut, the duo 
shot their low budget videos 
"Puppet Head" and "Don't Let's 
Start," a video which MTVlater 
put into strong rotation. 

What has received even more 
praise than their music is their 
stage show. 

Exuberant and improvisa: 
tional are two adjectives that 
have been used to describe their 
show, but it is something that 
cannot be described. 

They Might Be Giant> will 
be playing at Mandeville AudiÂ· 
torium on Sunday, Aprill. 

We a[ HlA TUS are JUSt chock full o'goodies for our readers. This week, 
we've got 2 pairs of tickets to the They Migh[ Be Giants concert at

Murphy 
Continued from pag 
fiedj an't sec as far a their next 
urprise." 

Like a much of his work , 
Murphy' lyric tend to be vague 
rather than po se sing a pccific 
me ag . By allowing the mu ic to 
be created "through [mysel~, it 
comes naturally," he aid. 

"Once YOll become cons ious 
and tart to stylize it , YOll lose 
something in the proces ." 

With Deep, Murphy tried to 
a hieve a sen e of letting the un-
expected be di covered. By draw-
ing on b th hi and the quartet's 
"performanc potential," Murphy 
would mentally decide how a song 
should ound before approaching 
the musician . 

"Unorthodoxy is really my rule," 
Murphy explained, "because it 
leads you in a certain direction. 
And some very interesting things 
come out of experimentation, 
which probably would not if I was 
too musically trained." 

Although Murphy and hi band 
have proved themselves apt per-
formers, this was not a concert to 
see at an ou tdoor venue on a sunny 
afternoon. The dark theater's 
gloomy atmosphere, coupled with 
Murphy's studied charisma, were 
the crucial elements that made 
the live show so powerful.

The two owner of the restau-
rant, George a:ld Joseph , are al-
way greeting their diner , and 
paying special attention to anyone 
who enters the door. TI1e special 
treatment completes the evening. 

The constant fear of dining in 
La Jolla is the ultimate cost of the 
evening. George E. Wong may be 
the most reasonably-priced restau-
rant in the area. 

The most expen ive item on 
the menu i the dim urn combina-
tion for $ 7 .95. This i a choice of3 
different items on the menu and 
guarantees leftovers to take home. 
The average price for a dinner for 

Â·two is $12-$18 (not including 
alcohol) . 

For a different dining experi-
ence that will be fun as well as 
economical, George E. Wong is a 
good choice. 

Editors' Note- Several members 
of the Guardian staff who were not 
reviewing the restaurant complained 
that when they ate at George E. 
Wong's the service was slow to non-
existent.

they want us to scald our hands

2) Why do the women'~bath Â­

3) Why, when water is arce, 
does the administrati n devote 
a much water to the concrete as 
theyd the lawn ? They're doing 
a good job-c ncrete eems to 
be pr uting up around campus 
more than anything else.
