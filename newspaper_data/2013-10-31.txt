UCSD psychology professor 
Edward Vul and graduate student 
Drew Walker conducted a study 
indicating that people appear more 
attractive in groups than they would 
as individuals. Such a phenomena is 
the result of “the cheerleader effect,” 
made popular by Barney Stinson of 
the show “How I Met Your Mother.” 

Inspired by the sitcom, Walker 
and Vul set out to test whether “the 
cheerleader effect” occurs in every-
day social interactions. During the 
summer of 2012 and spring of 2013, 
the researchers gathered 130 UCSD 
undergraduate students and asked 
them to rate 100 faces for attrac-
tiveness in a series of photographs. 
Walker and Vul found that subjects 
deemed individual faces viewed in 
a group photo more attractive than 
when isolated from the group picture. 

The team’s studies concluded that 
the brain tends to process groups as 
an ensemble. As a result, the brain 
automatically takes a group and evens 
out the unattractive characteristics 
of an individual, an operation that 
makes individual faces look more 
average than they would otherwise.

They found that female subjects 
rated men 5.6 percent more attractive 
in a group than they do in isolation, 
while men rated women 5.5 percent 
more attractive in a group.

“Average faces are more attractive, 
likely due to the averaging out of 
unattractive idiosyncrasies,” Walker 
said. “Perhaps it’s like Tolstoy’s fami-
lies: Beautiful people are all alike, but 
every unattractive person is unat-
tractive in their own way.

According to this research, being 
seen in a group can raise an indi-
vidual from the 49th to the 51st per-
centile in perceived attractiveness. 
Moreover, the researchers conducted 
experiments to test whether the size 
of the group or the quality of a pic-
ture affects an individual’s overall 
attractiveness.

In the first case, Walker and Vul

San Diego residents began early voting in October for the city’s special election that is being held 
on Nov. 19 — more than two months 
after ex-Mayor Bob Filner pled guilty 
to false imprisonment and two counts 
of misdemeanor battery. Among the

surrounded individual pictures with 
a varying amount of unrelated pho-
tos. Subjects were asked to rate one’s 
attractive when in isolation and when 
surrounded by four to 16 other pho-
tos. They found that an individual 
surrounded by 15 other people is 
considered more attractive than 
when viewed in isolation.

In the next experiment, students 
were asked to rate the attractiveness 
of both a blurred individual isolated 
from their group and a blurred photo 
of the group.  This experiment found 
a substantial increase in attractive-
ness for both the individual and the 
group in a blurred picture.

“It is perhaps best described as a 
‘benefit of the doubt’ effect,” Walker 
said. “When people can’t make out 

the features of a face, they assume the 
face to be more attractive than they 
would find it had they seen it clearly.”

The two researchers encourage 
students to take a tip from Barney 
Stinson. Having a few good wing-
men or wing-women might just be an 
effective dating strategy.

leaders such as State Superintendent 
of Instruction Tom Torlakson, 
Assembly Speaker John Perez 
(D-Los Angeles) and Gov. Jerry 
Brown. Brown said that his experi-
ence working with Fletcher in state 
assembly was the reason he believes 
Fletcher is the ideal candidate for 
mayor. “Nathan Fletcher will make 
an excellent mayor,” Brown said in 
an ABC News article. “I came to 
know Nathan when he was in the 
state assembly. He and I worked 
together on tax reform, stimulating 
jobs and balancing the state budget.” 

At UCSD, a student organization 
called Tritons For Fletcher helped 
promote Fletcher’s campaign as well. 
Muir College junior Isaac Mallett is 
one of the founders of Tritons For 
Fletcher and hopes to see Fletcher 
elected. “We’re doing simple things 
such as tabling at Library Walk 
and getting those volunteers and 
contacting them afterwards to run 
phone banks on campus,” Mallett 
said. “It’s really just to get people out 
there supporting Nathan, getting 
to know him and getting them out 
there to vote.”

Faulconer is another popular 
contender for mayor with his expe-

rience as a San Diego assemblyman 
since 2006. His campaign focus is on 
generating new jobs to improve San 
Diego’s economy. “I feel good and 
energized because we’ve got a lot 
of support from young people and 
college students,” Faulconer said. 
“I’m making that outreach a focus of 
my campaign, particularly creating 
jobs so that when students gradu-
ate, they can stay in San Diego.” He 
also emphasizes the need to address 
neighborhood services that have 
been neglected, including the parks, 
libraries, recreation centers and the 
streets in San Diego.

Alvarez, also a member of City 
Council, is endorsed by top educa-
tion officials, including San Diego 
Unified School District Board 
of Education President John Lee 
Evans, trustees Richard Barrera, 
Kevin Beiser and Marne Foster, as 
well as Greg Robinson, who is a 
member of the San Diego County 
Board of Education.

Having served as San Diego’s city 
attorney from 2004 to 2008, Aguirre 
has big plans in mind for San Diego 
that involves UCSD.  “We can work 
together to reclaim our watersheds 
[so] that we can strive to make San 
Diego America’s most sustainable 
city,” Aguirre said. “And I want to 
do that with the help of the good 

students of UCSD.” His goal is to 
bring down the cost of living in San 
Diego as well as offer interest rate 
relief to students attending colleges 
in the city.

Men’s rights activists are missing the bigger 
picture of effectively communicating their goals. 
With their aggressive advertisement campaigns 
that attack feminist groups, men’s rights activ-
ists are turning their community’s ideology into 
petty antagonism.

In the interests of the women’s rights 
movement, feminists launched the “Don’t 
Be That Guy” campaign in 2010. It aimed to 
reduce the number of sexual assault cases and 
encourage victims to report incidents of rape. 
Unfortunately, in 2013, the men’s rights move-
ment crossed the line and launched the offen-
sive “Don’t Be That Girl” campaign in response, 
just to spite the feminists. 

By trivializing such a sensitive issue, men’s 
rights activists are taking the wrong approach 
in their campaigns, fostering animosity between 
gender groups.

Instead of bringing their community’s issues 
to light, the MRM is known for the profane 
comments of their extremist activists. Men’s 
rights activist and founder of the website A 
Voice for Men, Paul Elam, theorized that ugly 
women “wanted to be raped” in an attempt to be 
sexually desired. Absurdly offensive claims like 
this could potentially provoke a spate of gender 
conflicts as Men’s rights activists insensitively 
dismiss feminist values. Incendiary actions such 
as these are not beneficial to their cause, but 
instead exacerbate gender tensions.

The purpose of men’s rights campaigns should 
be to advocate their cause, rather than to con-
demn the Women’s rights movement. In order to 
achieve gender equality and men’s rights, activists 
must take a more thoughtful and politically cor-
rect approach to spread their ideas.

Men’s Rights Campaign May Be 
Unorthodox, But Exposes Real Issues

Mutual Antagonism Does Not Help 
the Underlying Gender Parity Problem

MRM’s Offensive Attacks on Women  
Overshadow Community’s Key Values

Feminism has embedded major sociopoliti-
cal implications in society, and the more recent 
men’s rights movement is attempting to do the 
same. In the process, however, both groups’ 
efforts seem to perpetuate conventional gender 
images as they aggressively point out the faults 
of the opposite gender and behave contrary to 
the ideals of equality.

One prevalent gender stereotype is that men 
are the primary perpetrators of sexual harass-
ment. Unfortunately, some men’s rights activists, 
or “MRAs,” reinforce this gender divide with 
threatening remarks. Journalist Aja Romano 
writes that during an MRA lecture on April 4, a 
female protester attempted to communicate the 
common issues that both feminists and MRAs 
want to address. Despite their advocacy for gen-
der parity, the MRAs sent her death and rape 
threats. If the MRAs want to shed the stereotype, 
reacting profanely is not the way to do it.

Nevertheless, men aren’t the only ones hold-
ing onto gender preconceptions. Although some 
men sympathize with the feminist movement, 
they are rebuffed by radical feminists. The 
Huffington Post’s Octavia Sheepshanks described 
a Cambridge Men’s Feminist Discussion Group 
on Facebook that shut down due to serious 
backlash from radical feminists. The extremists 
argued that men do not have a place in feminist 
politics, regardless of their views; this effectively 
removes any chance of bridging the gap between 
the ideologies.

Although both groups may rally for gender 
equality, they ultimately fail to reconcile gender 
differences. Perhaps more wholesome discussion 
should be encouraged, since little is accomplished 
when so much energy is funneled toward conflict.

It is a deplorable and undeniable fact that 
some men are guilty of shameful crimes against 
women; however, the wide application of violent 
male stereotypes is often unmerited. The men’s 
rights movement was established not to counter 
feminism, but to point out some of its overreach-
ing ideas of equality by drawing attention to issues 
concerning men.

For centuries, feminists have fought for wom-
en’s rights, providing much welcomed progress. 
Unfortunately, this fight for equality has placed 
some unequal limitations on the opposite sex. 
Women have been granted special protections that 
can — at times — leave men the victims.

Although the “Don’t Be That Girl” campaign 
is extreme and insulting, some of the movement’s 
arguments are valid: While women are more likely 
to find themselves victims of sexual assault, men 
are often falsely accused of rape. According to a 
2006 Fox News report, forensic DNA testing found 
that 25 to 26 percent of all rape cases referred to 
the FBI were false. 

Of course, false rape accusation is not the 
group’s only concern. In an article for the Oct. 24 
publication of The American Prospect, a broader 
spectrum of issues is listed, including the elevated 
suicide rate for men, discrimination in educa-
tion, economic and workplace conditions, fathers’ 
rights to custody and rates of male imprisonment. 
The aim of this group is not particularly to insult 
women, but rather to illuminate the often over-
looked troubles of the opposite sex. 

Though radical at times, the men’s rights 
movement challenges us to take a more objective 
approach when dealing with the sensitive issue of 
gender discrimination; not just women, but men 
too suffer from it.

Let’s Not 
Forget 
About The 
Homeless

NICO  HEMSLEY NAHEMSLEY@ucsd.eduJUSTICE   IS   SERVED

Many are familiar with the discomfort of waiting for a red light next to a 
homeless person on La Jolla Village 
Drive. After my own experiences 
with the homeless I am left feel-
ing guilty, sad, sometimes even 
disgusted. I have been conditioned 
to avoid them because of these 
depressing experiences — and it’s 
hard for any one individual to help, 
since offering the homeless money 
can sometimes just perpetuate their 
problems. Real change requires the 
coordinated work of many people, 
and we can help reintegrate the 
homeless into society by investing 
in our communities.

On the societal level, factors 
that contribute to homelessness 
such as mental illness, chronic 
disease, unemployment, and dis-
ability are treatable, preventable, 
or manageable. We have success-
ful, evidence-based, and cost-
effective public programs in place 
like former President George W. 
Bush’s “housing first” program and 
Obama’s Homeless Prevention and 
Rapid Re-Housing Program. Each 
prevented a rise in homelessness 
in addition to aiding hundreds of 
thousands of at-risk or currently 
homeless people.

However, the needs of the 
homeless aren’t being prioritized. In 
the Budget Control Act, Congress 
exempted many programs such 
as Medicare and Supplemental 
Security Income Benefits from 
funding cuts, but didn’t include the 
U.S. Department of Housing and 
Urban Development (HUD) pro-
grams that serve the same purpose 
through affordable housing. HUD 
expects homeless program cutbacks 
to displace more than 100,000 
people from housing or shelter 
programs. This is antithetical to 
our knowledge that a stable home 
is an essential feature of mental and 
physical health. 

Furthermore, mental and physi-
cal health is essential to being a 
productive member of society. 
According to the National Alliance 
to End Homelessness, investment 
in safe, decent and affordable hous-
ing improves health, lowers crime, 
creates jobs and increases employ-
ment opportunity and stability. 
These all contribute to economic 
stability. Additionally, affordable 
housing achieves regional equity 
and creates opportunities for those 
with low-income. So even if one is 
cynical about the human condition, 
it’s simply wrong to discount the 
fact that help for the homeless is 
beneficial to our society as a whole.

The homeless suffer in abject 
conditions that are beyond their 
control. There’s a lot of injustice in 
the world, and of lot of it we can-
not immediately change, but what 
makes this situation different is 
that the goal is within reach: We 
already have a number of successful 
federal programs in place to ease 
these people’s burden. According 
to the Campaign for Housing and 
Community Development Funding, 
reducing aid for these programs 
would have a devastating impact on 
our efforts to end homelessness. To 
continue cuts would be a tremen-
dous step backward for society. We 
have to notice what we’ve learned 
to ignore.

BY CARL DEMAIO

For genera-tions, the strength 
of America has 
been this simple 
concept: No 
matter where 
you start from, 
you are free to 

be anything you want.
Unfortunately, those born after 

1980 — sometimes known as the 
Millennial Generation — are at risk 
of losing out on the opportunities 
that prior generations of Americans 
enjoyed. Indeed, Millennials may 
face a future where they are anything 
but “free to be.”

Washington politicians have run 
up trillions in debt and are mak-
ing it harder for individuals to get 
the basic support services and job 
opportunities to make ends meet, let 
alone achieve the American Dream.

That’s why I’m running for 
United States Congress.

It is also why I’m taking on 
both political parties — including 
Republicans — to get them to change 
policies that have traditionally been a 
big turnoff to younger voters.

 To jumpstart the conversation, 
I released a national policy plan 
that I’m calling the “Free to Be 
Initiative,” which seeks to restore 
freedoms and opportunities for 
Millennials in five areas of life.

First, you should be Free to Be 
in the job of your dreams. Bad poli-
cies and burdensome regulations 
have stifled investment, favored big 
business over small business and 
created obstacles to innovation and 
entrepreneurship. By focusing on 
job creation, we provide opportu-
nities for Millennials to have eco-
nomic freedom and the satisfaction 
of being in a job in their desired 
career path.

Second, you should be Free 
to Be who you are, with full and 
equal rights. Like a supermajority 
of Millennials, I personally support 
marriage equality, medical marijua-
na, a woman’s right to choose and 
oppose government spying on its 

own citizens without due process. 
We should commit to respecting 
individual personal freedoms, not 
limiting them.

It is time to put an end to the 
bitter fights and division on social 
issues brought on by the extremes 
in both political parties and trust 
in individuals to solve these issues 
on their own in the context of their 
own faith, their own family and 
their own personal circumstance.

Third, you should be Free to 
Be able to afford your tuition. I’m 
concerned about the skyrocketing 
costs of college tuition — especially 
the emerging crisis in the student

loan market where too many col-
lege graduates cannot afford the debt 
service on their loans. My Free to Be 
Initiative outlines reforms to reduce 
pension costs in the UC and CSU sys-
tems, as well as a number of ways to 
make it easier to refinance and repay 
student loans.

Fourth, you should be Free to 
Be in control of your health care. 
It is true that we face a health care 
crisis, but ObamaCare only makes 
it worse. Some studies peg wasteful 
spending in health care as high as 
30% of every dollar spent. Instead 
of fixing the cost crisis, ObamaCare 
focuses on pumping more revenue 
into a broken system. 

Finally, you should be Free to 
Be not stuck paying off debts that 

aren’t yours. With the current fis-
cal mess in Washington, we are 
witnessing one generation robbing 
another — running up big debts 
that the Millennial generation will 
have to pay off through fewer ser-
vices and higher taxes.

In San Diego, I was proud to 
write the plan and secure bipartisan 
support for reforms to save the city 
from bankruptcy. We can balance 
the budget but do it in a way that 
makes government work better 
without sacrificing the important 
programs and services many rely 
upon. I led the citizens’ initia-
tive to make San Diego’s pension 
system financially sustainable and 
fair again, wiping away billions in 
liabilities and costs for future gen-

erations while providing retirees 
with retirement security. We can 
do the same to strengthen and pre-
serve Social Security and Medicare 
and ensure that Millenials also have 
a secure retirement.

You can’t wait for Washington 
politicians in either political party 
to solve the problems — you must 
get actively involved in demanding 
changes today so you can have the 
opportunities you deserve tomorrow.

I hope you will join me in 
advancing the ideas in the Free 
to Be Initiative so you, like past 
generations, will have the personal 
freedoms and economic opportuni-
ties to live your life as you wish.

THE SUPERNATURAL
DEMYSTIFIED

T he mystic creatures — vampires, werewolves and zom-bies — that we’ve all heard of, and feared, have become a cultural phenomenon in recent years. UCSD litera-
ture professor Lisa Lampert-Weissig is no stranger to this 
phenomenon; she’s been studying the historical and literary 
representations of supernatural beings for about five 
years now, and she believes that there may be 

more to the supernatural than one might think. 
Lampert-Weissig explores connections to the 

supernatural that may not be completely obvious at 
first glance. Her research also examines the figure of the “out-
sider” and how the supernatural is related to humans. 

“[When it comes to the supernatural], I’m interested in the 
role of the outsider,” Lampert-Weissig said. “Most of my research 

has been very [focused on] Anti-Semitism in early literature, racism in early literature 
and the outsider.”

Through her research, she has discovered that the outsider is very common in 
the supernatural. 

While her true passion lies in Medievalist and Jewish studies, Lampert-Weissig 
has used this background to discover connections with the supernatural. In fact, 
since many people find the supernatural to be an interesting or unique topic, 
Lampert-Weissig uses it to teach students about cultures and the Medieval period 
through the connections she’s found between the two.

These connections can be found in her work — more specifically, in 
a book that she’s currently writing about what she calls the “Wandering 
Jew.” Her book depicts a tale about a man who insults Jesus on the way to 
Cavalry and is then told by Jesus, “I will go, but you will remain forever.” 

“[The Jew then becomes] this undead kind of figure who is 
doomed to wait out for the second coming,” Lampert-Weissig said. 

In other words, the Jew has become an outsider. 
“[Supernatural beings are] constructed in a way that responds to 

people’s fears,” Lampert-Weissig said. “The word ‘monster’ comes from 
the [phrase] ‘to warn.’ They tell you quite a bit about a culture and what 
people may be worried about and concerned about and what’s hidden, 
lurking beneath the surface of things.”

Lampert-Weissig expressed her fascination with how the supernatural 
is connected to our society, a notion she expands upon in a freshman 
seminar she’s currently teaching on zombies. The seminar gives students 
insight to the possible connections zombies have with society and the 
origins of such creatures. She will also be teaching a seminar on vampires 
during spring quarter.

“With the collapse of the economy, zombies seem to have taken over,” 
Lampert-Weissig said. “Commercially, I think the economy feels so bleak 
right now, and so many things are breaking down that people are losing 
faith, and the monsters we are imagining now are zombies.”

Lampert-Weissig has observed this pattern throughout other supernatural 
crazes as well. While zombies are prominent now, vampires were previously 
the obsession of the country.

UCSD’s fashion community has 
just gotten a little bigger. Fashion 
Advancements through Modes of 
Expression, or F.A.M.E., a newly 
founded club at UCSD, allows stu-
dents of any background to try on the 
fashion industry for size without the 
exclusivity of most fashion organiza-
tions. It’s only been five weeks, but 
the club has already made strides on 
the big stage: College Fashion Week, 
a national fashion show tour that 
stopped in San Diego this year.

Even though F.A.M.E. is a 
fledgling club, it was able to col-
laborate with other UCSD fash-
ion organizations, such as ELAN 
Zine fashion magazine, to promote 
College Fashion Week and make 
connections with high-profile fig-
ures, such as Brian Hawkins, the 
co-founder of StyleSeeker. The 
event, hosted by HerCampus and 
StyleSeeker, was held on Oct. 19 at 
the Fashion Institute of Design and 
Merchandising in San Diego.

Club president Deborah Yu, an 
Eleanor Roosevelt College sopho-
more, believes that F.A.M.E. great-
ly benefited from the networking 
opportunities the event offered.

“The speaker for our next GBM 
is actually someone who spoke at 
College Fashion Week,” Yu said, 
“Through [the event], I was able 
to get her contact info, and she was 
very open to helping students.”

Yu says that the club puts its 
members first and emphasizes event 
planning, marketing and public 
relations. According to Yu, F.A.M.E. 
is designed for people who want to 
see what fashion is all about.

“I just want to help students 
that want to work in fashion who 

want to gain more experience and 
insight into it,” Yu said, “Especially 
at UCSD, where we’re a very science 
and engineering-based school, it’s 
hard to find outlets for [fashion].”

As a freshman, Yu herself strug-
gled with finding a fashion commu-
nity. However, she stumbled across 
No. 15, a fashion magazine on cam-
pus that disbanded this year. As 
a contributor, Yu picked up many 
tricks of the trade that she would 
take over to F.A.M.E. The idea for 
founding a less exclusive fashion 
club came about through conver-
sations with fellow contributor, 
Eleanor Roosevelt College junior 

Rebecca Chien.
“Initially, I felt like I wouldn’t be 

able to do it,” Yu said. “But if I didn’t 
do it, I knew I would wonder what 
could have been. [I decided to] try 
it out and see if [I’d] like it — see if 
[it’d work]. And if it [didn’t], at least 
I [tried].”

For Yu, there are certainly no 
regrets now. F.A.M.E. was already 
active in promoting College Fashion 
Week and will also hold a sustain-
able fashion show at Price Center 
Ballroom East on Feb. 7. It’s in the 
process of contacting potential sus-
tainable company sponsors and mod-
eling pieces from sustainable design-

ers and boutiques. In planning for the 
show, Yu aims to find a way to raise 
money to donate to an environmen-
tal organization or charity without 
charging an entry fee. 

F.A.M.E. also runs a blog titled 
“Triton Eye,” which was Chien’s 
idea. The blog was started for mem-
bers who are interested in poten-
tially working for fashion magazines 
to hone their writing skills. The 
blog features articles about commu-
nity fashion news, editorials about 
the latest fashion trends and photos 
from campus photo shoots.

For the blog’s first photo shoot, 
Yu took pictures of fashionable 

Tritons while tabling on Library 
Walk with compliment cards as a 
way to promote her club. Yu hopes 
that the blog will change the way 
people look at UCSD.

“It’s a way to show people that 
there is more to people at UCSD 
than meets the eye,” Yu said. “The 
reason we named it ‘Triton Eye’ was 
sort of satirical, and we’re hoping to 
do more campus style shoots [...] to 
dispel all the stereotypes that come 
with UCSD — that people aren’t 
attractive and dress really boring.”

Lampert-Weissig Believes We Can Learn About Ourselves by Studying the Role of  Monsters in Stories

“One writer says, vampires 
go where the power is,” Lampert 
Weissig said.

She revealed that in literature, 
vampires have been viewed as 
incredibly strong and power-
ful, especially when compared to 
humans. They’ve also been por-
trayed as beings that crave power. 

Because America isn’t as power-
ful as it has been, this pattern gives 
an explanation as to why the vam-
pire obsession might have ended. 
While Lampert-Weissig draws 
connections from the supernatural 
to pop culture, she also sees ties in 
the origin of the supernatural to 
human beliefs, cultures and traits. 

According to Lampert-Weissig, 
zombies originated from mixed 
fears of the plague and contagion. 
Furthermore, according to her stud-
ies, vampires originated when people 
in Eastern Europe created stories 
of these fictional creatures as the 
sources of plagues and disease. 

The creation of the supernatural 
was brought about by humans but is, 
in the same way, based on humans.

“You can explore differ-

ent aspects of the human through 
[supernatural creatures],” Lampert-
Weissig said.

“[The] supernatural tends to 
extend the powers of the human,” 
Lampert-Weissig said. “The super-
natural ends up giving us a more 
intense form of what the human is.” 

“Supernatural beings are 
immortal or incredibly strong 
with heightened senses,” Lampert-
Weissig said. “These beings have 
several of the same traits as 
humans, although to a 
much higher level.” 

But views of 
the super-
natural 
change 
over 
time. 

“With the werewolf, in the 
medieval French stories, it is often 
a pretty noble figure,” Lampert-
Weissig said. “[But] with the mod-
ern werewolf, it’s more about this 
beast within and a curse coming 
over someone.”

There is no exact explanation 
for why this is, but Lampert-
Weissig aims to find out. 

“There’s been this sort of sea 
change,” Lampert-Weissig said. “I 

don’t have a fully formed theory of 
how that is, but I’m interested in 
that. It’s interesting to think about 
why those changes are happening.”

We can see it in television 
shows, though, which play a big 
part in popular culture. 

“[The] characters [in these 
shows] are always exploring what 
it means to be human,” Lampert-
Weissig said.

By taking a look at our history 
and culture, we can learn a 

lot more about these supernatural 
creatures than meets the eye, and 
we may also learn a little about 
ourselves in the process.

“By looking at these monsters in 
the past and looking at how they’ve 
changed and how they’re the same, 
we can learn something about our-
selves,” Lampert-Weissig said.

investing in our university. Stronger 
athletics will translate into better 
performing teams which will bring 
about higher revenue streams and 
alumni-giving. 

Coming on the coattails of the 
Hall of Fame opening and the first 
eight Hall of Fame banners hanging 
in RIMAC Arena, the time is right 
to start recruiting a new generation 
of Triton elite.

In the meantime, I will be 
starting a collection fund in the 
Guardian office so we can start 
strengthening our athletics from 
within. Bring your checks for $19 
million to our second floor office of 
the Student Center so we can start 
looking toward the future.

Or, if that’s too expensive, we 
can keep sitting on the sidelines and 
buying Jersey Mike’s and Adidas 
until we start to feel the real impact 
of our athletes.

Davis improves in the conference 
standings, with a 3–0 record. The 
Aggies’ next few games will shape 
the conference tournament bracket. 

“At this point, it’s two teams 

that are looking to play each other 
again,” UCSD assistant coach Matt 
Ustaszewski said. “It’ll be in their 
pool, but now we’ll get back to work 
and get ready for the thing that 
really matters.”

UCSD will be on the road next 

week to close the season facing No. 
7 Cal State Long Beach on Thursday, 
Nov. 7 at 5 p.m. and No. 8 UC Irvine

Behind seniors MacKenzie 
McCullough’s 22 points and James 
McCann’s 17 points, the UCSD men’s 
basketball team earned a 71–63 
win over Division I Grand Canyon 
University last Friday.

Playing on the road, the Tritons 
came out hot, hitting four straight 
three-pointers to grab the early 12–2 
lead. McCullough sunk five out of six 
from three-point range — shooting an 
efficient 67 percent from the field. The 
senior small forward finished with 22 
points and seven rebounds. 

“I thought our guys played really 
hard from start to finish,” UCSD head 
coach Eric Olen said to the UCSD ath-
letics department. “We gave up a lead 
late in the second half, but our effort 
never wavered and we were able to 
fight back and make some plays down 
the stretch.”

Freshman guard Aleks Lipovic 
added another four buckets from 
beyond the arc, ending the night 
with 14 points and four rebounds. 
McCullough attributed the early lead 
to strong defense.

“Our main focus was playing 
defense, because that’s what really wins 
games for us,” McCullough said. “In 
terms of my personal shooting, some 
nights you just fall into a groove, and 
Friday was one of those nights.”

But Grand Canyon was able to 
bounce right back, going on a 14–1 
run to take the one point lead with 11 
minutes left to the play in the first half. 

At the end of the first half, UCSD 

led 30–29.
 The game remained close in the 

second half, with the two teams trad-
ing leads. 

UCSD’s sophomore forward Hunter 
Walker (11 points, four rebounds) hit a 
crucial three-pointer with 1:58 to play, 
keeping the game tied at 63.

Senior guard James McCann 
took control late in the game, scoring 
the last eight points of the matchup. 
Attacking aggressively in the paint, 
McCann made back-to-back layups 
and earned four late free throws to seal 
the win, finishing the night with 17 
points, two assists and two rebounds. 

“We knew that we absolutely need-
ed to finish plays in order to win 
the game,” said McCullough. “We 
worked hard on defense and got James 
[McCann] into some mismatch sce-
narios, allowing him to get to the bas-
ketball and ice the win for us.”

The Tritons face Daemen College 
from Amherst, N.Y. on Friday, Nov. 15 
in their first home game of the season. 
UCSD begins California Collegiate 
Athletic Association conference play 
when they square up against Cal State 
San Bernardino on Nov. 21. 

Olen said the team is looking for-
ward to league play and the regular 
season.

“I’m really pleased with our effort 
tonight, and this win will give us some 
confidence going forward,” Olen said. 
“We’re really excited about the poten-
tial we have.”

 
 

The UCSD men’s water polo team ended the Western Water Polo Association conference play in a 1–1 split at home this weekend, beat-
ing Santa Clara on Friday before losing to UC Davis 
12–11 the following day.

The Tritons will advance to the WWPA confer-
ence tournament with either the No. 1 or No. 2 seed, 
depending on the outcome of UC Davis’s remaining 
conference matches. Davis will only need to win one 
of its remaining two games to secure the top seed 
from UCSD.

At Canyonview Pool, No. 10 UCSD came from 
behind against No. 14 Santa Clara to take the 10–9 
win. Santa Clara, who was up 6–1 in the second 
quarter, started the game by scoring quickly with the 
Tritons struggling to keep up. But the deficit seemed 
to wake up the Triton offense late in the period, going 
on an 8–1 run against the Broncos. 

“Early on there wasn’t a lot of movement, but that 
was a tremendous comeback for us to then go on 
an 8–1 run; that doesn’t really happen in our sport,” 
UCSD head coach Denny Harper said. 

Even with Triton standouts, juniors Tommy 
Friedrich and Matt Michalko sick, the Tritons rallied 
to close the gap with solid performances from sopho-
more Tician Toplak and junior Dan Lorch. 

In their last conference game, No. 17 Davis beat 
the No. 10 Tritons 12–11 in sudden death, overtime 
play, despite a career high six goals from Dietrich.

The defeat marks the Tritons’ first loss in WWPA 
play on the year with a 4–1 conference record, while

UCSD takes two wins at home, beating Chico

UCSD beats Grand Canyon in exhibition matchup, 
Tritons to begin preseason play against Daemen.

The UCSD men’s basketball team 
played a competitive exhibition game 
last Friday against Division I oppo-
nent University of Pittsburgh, losing 
72–59. Senior guard James McCann 
and senior forward MacKenzie 
McCullough both scored 13 points 
apiece in UCSD’s first game of the new 
season.

Pitt’s zone defense forced the 
Tritons into sloppy possession. UCSD 
recorded 10 out of their 15 turnovers 
in the first half, with Pitt capitalizing 
to score 10 points off Triton turnovers. 
Pitt’s size advantage in the front court 
also allowed the Panthers to capital-
ize off of rebounds, with senior for-

ward Talib Zanna grabbing 11 boards 
and adding on 17 points to give the 
Panthers the early lead.

However, the Tritons kept the game 
close with their three-point shooting, 
hitting 10 shots from behind the arc. 
Starting point guard McCann had a 
strong, well-rounded performance, 
hitting two for two from the three-
point line as well as 13 points, five 
assists and five rebounds to lead the 
Tritons. McCullough also recorded 13 
points and four rebounds. 

Pitt led 32–24 at the end of the 
first half.

The “Molecular Cell Biology” textbook for BICD 110 runs for $187.50 at the 
UCSD Bookstore. Bundle that 
with the solution manual ($55.50), 
ECON 100A’s “Microeconomics: 
Theory & Applications” ($106.75), 
MATH 20C’s “Calculus: Early 
Transcendentals” ($110.10) and 
HIEU 144’s “Republican Roman 
Army” ($41.95), and a student ath-
lete taking these four courses in a 
single quarter at UCSD has already 
gone almost $2 over their entire ath-
letic scholarship for the year.

Each UCSD student-athlete 
(who meets a cumulative academic 
criterion) receives a measly $500 
check to compensate them for over 
20 hours of practices, games and 
meets a week — on top of full course 
loads.

Granted, athletes can and do 
take other jobs on campus, but the 
time commitment to their sport is 
so tremendous that athletes should 
not be expected to work beyond 
their athletic and academic com-
mitments just to afford the campus 
they attend.

While it’s true that our sporting 
events don’t draw millions of dol-
lars in television revenue, our ath-
letes do help the department make 
bank through corporate sponsor-
ships, alumni-giving and, to a lesser 
extent, ticket and concession sales. 
It’s utterly unfair that athletes aren’t 
compensated more than they are.

This isn’t analogous to the 
national argument that Division I 
athletes across the country should 
be paid more than the cost of liv-
ing on and attending a campus they 
compete for. 

That discussion already assumes 
that college athletes can and are 
given full scholarships.

At UCSD, every athlete is treated 
the same — the benchwarmers and 
the starters both get the same sti-
pend — as long as they make the 
grade. While this system does seem 
more kibbutz-like (look it up) than 
major D-I schools who give full 
rides to the all-American all-stars 
and kick the walk-ons to the curb 
financially, UCSD’s inability to grant 
full scholarships to athletes limits 
our recruiting abilities and overall 
potential to perform in intercolle-
giate athletics. 

Currently, UCSD is the only D-II 
school that does not award scholar-
ships to athletes — despite our uni-
versity being one of the biggest and 
most academically notable. 

Women’s volleyball outside hitter 
Danielle Dahle told me that while a 
change in the system for distribut-
ing scholarship money to athletes 
may be in the works, athletes strug-
gling to afford tuition could certain-
ly benefit from additional funding.

“There needs to be more money 
in the system,” Dahle said. “Other 
schools like Sonoma [State] and 
[Cal State] San Bernardino have 
around eight times the money to 
use for recruiting, and that puts us 
at such a disadvantage.

“The $500 is such a small num-
ber, and I’m sure there are athletes 
who are struggling to afford UCSD, 
so more money in the scholarship 
pool would help them, as well.”
