Central American Leader 
Receives Award at UCSD 
By CATHERINE DILLE 
Newa Editor 

Costa Rican President and Nobel Prize 
Laureate Dr. Oscar Arias was presented 
with the Institute of the Americas' award 
for Democracy and Peace yesterday at 
UCSD. 

Arias, who received the Nobel Peace 
prize in 1987 for his efforts toward resolv-
ing political conflicts in Central America, 
spoke yesterday on his plans to bring de-
mocracy to Central America and on his 
reaction to the recent political develop-
ments in that region. 

The Institute's Board of Directors cited 
Arias' "exceptional persistence and crea-
tivity in pressing both peace and demo-
cratic reform in Central America" as well 
as his role in leading "the Central Ameri-
can presidents in assuming responsibility 
fornegotiating ~solutions to their region's 
conflicts" as reasons for selecting him to 
receive the award. 

During his speech, Arias referred to the 
Reagan Administration's response to the 
1987 Arias Peace Plan as "lukewarm" and 
"past history," saying that "the main issue 
was peace for Central America." 

"My plan was supponed by the whole 
world; Europe, Latin America, everybody. 
From Washington we got some lip service 
support, but many people tried to under-

• mine it," he said. 
"TIley never expected that the five Cen-

tral American presidents would be able to 

reach an agreement as we did in August on 
1987." 

"Once we reached that agreement, there 
were still many obstacles, but since we signed 
the accord, everything has changed in the 
region. We have had many meetings; at the 
last one we agreed to demobilize and relo-
cate the Contras. We hope we will be able to 
achieve this." 

Aries also said that he is pleased with the 
steps toward democracy that Nicaragua has 
taken since the accord from signed. 

"I am very satisfied with what we have 
achieved in Nicaragua ... there is a lot of 
pressure from the whole w9rld on the Sandi n-
ista government ... for them to hold fair and 
free elections," he said. 

"They won' t be as fairor as free as in this 
country or in my country, but the Nicara-
guans are not used to free elections in their 
history." 

However, Arias said that he is still "sad-
dened by what is happening in EI Salvador" 
and is hoping that talks between the EI 
Salvadoran government and guerillas will 
help end unrest in that country. 

"I hope to mediate, and hopefully an 
agreement can be reached, but it won't be 
easy," he explained. 

Arias said that the Bush administration 
has shown suppon for his plans for democ-
racy in Central America. 

"We, the five Central American presi-
dents, like to talk to the U.S. government 
with one single voice, not as things used to 
be in the past ... now at least there is one 
single voice in Washington," he said.

UC Bans'Fighting Words~ 
By RANDY DOTINGA 
Senior Staff Writer 

UC students who use "fighting words" 
to harass others may face punishment as 
harsh as dismissal from the University, 
due to an addition to the UC Student 
Conduct Policy recently instituted by UC 
President David P. Gardner. 

The new policy, which was announced 
in a Sept. 21 letter by Gardner to UC 
chancellors, defines "fighting words" as 
those which are "inherently likely to pro-
voke a violent reaction whether or not they 
actually do so." 

"Such words include, but are not lim-
ited to, those terms widely recognized to 
be derogatory references to race, ethnic-
ity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, dis-
ability, and other personal characteristics," 
according to the policy. 

However, Rick Milaspina, UC 
President 's Office spokesperson, aid 
"there's no way to say what ' fighting 
words ' are .... It depends on how a person 
reacts to them and how they were used and 
in what context. There is a fine line be-

Inside ... 
• OPINION 
• HIATUS 
• SPORTS

HI 
10 

tween free speech and harassment, but 
we believe there is a line." 

According to Malaspina the develop-
ment of the policy was prompted by 
concern about incidents of harassment in 
the UC and colleges nationwide in recent 
years. 

"The whole idea of this is to allow 
someone who feels insulted or wronged 
to such a degree as defined in the policy 
to complain and have that complaint 
investigated," he said. 

Each campus will have the responsi-
bility "to investigate complaints and 
render judgments" concerning the poli-
cyn on a case-by-case basis, Milaspina 
said. Discipline for violation of the pol-
icy can be as severe as dismissal from the 
University. 

The policy had been "formulated by 
staff in the UC President's Office with 
con<;ultation of chancellors, and then quite 
a bit of legal review by University Coun-
sel," he said. 

He added that although the Univer-
sity considers the policy to be legal, it 
still might "be challenged in orne way."

A.S. Allocates Money For 
SexualAlVarenessVVeek 
By JAMES COLLIER 
Contibuting Writer 

After a very heated debate, the AS 
Council last night approved $1,570 for a 
project described by its organizers as "sex-
ual awareness week," scheduled for the week 
of October 23-27. The Board denied Muir 
Junior Senator Kathy Ho's request for an 
additional $1,200. 

Controversy arose when Ho, the main 
organizer of the event, surprised everyone 
by asking for the additional funding. 

Ho had previously requested only $1 ,500, 
but said she needed additional funding for a 
movie, the performing group the Mar Dels, 
and additional advertising. 

Ho had said in a previous meeting with 
the Finance Committee that she could wait 
until next week before a decision was made 
on funding for her project. During the coun-
cil meeting, however, she said she needed 
the additional money or "we won't be able 
to get the ball rolling." 

Craig Peters, one of the organizers of the 
event, said that pan of the plan was to 
"distribute 2,000 condoms as well as 1,000 
sponges because many women are embar-
rassed about having condoms." Some of the 

()PI:\;I( ):'tJ 
Bringing Choice 
To Education 4 

cooncil members disapproved of the distri-
bution of sponges because of the sponges' 
inability to prevent AIDS. 

"I'm sick and tired of talking about 
AIDS," Peters said. "If you talk about some-
thing too much, it turns people off. I want to 
talk about sexual awareness." 

The council first decided to regulate the 
decision for the event's funding until the 
next A.S. Council meeting, but Ho was able 
to arrange a second vote. 

"This is ridiculous," Peters said. "I just 
want the money so everything can be done 
on time." 

Another of the council members, Larry 
Becker, said "I think the budget is over-
weight ... 1 don't think this is a good idea." 

"I feel like I'm being strong-armed into 
okaying this proposal. It needs to go to [the] 
finance [committee], and the budget needs 
to be hammered out. I like the idea, but not 
right now," he continued. 

Ho failed to get the additional funding, 
but on the second vote she received the 
original amount she asked for plus an addi-
tional $70 for banners. 

Anders Roede, vice president of finance 
said, "$2, 700 i a lot of money. The $1 ,500 
they originally requested can help them get 
the ball rolling."

Program Formed to Help Minority 
Engineering Students at UCSD 

Each year thousands of minority students enter 
engineering programs. but a significant majority of 
them will never earn engineering degrees. 

In an effort to reverse this trend, the UCSD Divi-
sion of Engineering has instituted a Minority Engineer-
ing Program (MEP). 

Ofelia Arellano-Romero. who holds a Ph.D. in 
educational counseling from UCSB, was named director 
ofMEP in January and, since then, she has been looking 
for ways to curb the high dropout rate for underrepre-
sented minority engineering students. 

To build the self-confidence of the 850rso incom-
ing minority engineering students this fall , Arellano-
Romero plans to set up special tutoring and advising 
programs and to organize study groups. 

During her first few months on the job, Arellano-
Romero met with about 80 percent of the 275 minority 

Motley's Crew 

engineering student at UCSD to evaluate their prog-
ress. 

The MEP program works in conjunction with the 
statewide Mathematics. Engineering. Science Achieve-
ment (MESA) Program currently operating at 18 cam-
puses in California.

Public Hearing Held to Review UCSD 
Long Range Development Plan 

Several La Jolla residents voiced concerns over 
UCSD 's revised long-range development plan at a Sept. 
25 public hearing. 

The purpose of the hearing, held at UCSD, was to 
hear public react ion to UCSD' s long -range development 
plan (LRDP), which is a general land use plan to guide 
the physical development of UCSD throughout the aca-
demic year 2005-6. 

The LRDP projects that the campus will be devel-
oped through the term of the plan to a maximum of 
9,940,000 square feet of academic and other facilities. 
and will accomodate 26,OSO students and I 6,900 faculty, 
staff and researchers for a total population of 42,950. 

La Jolla resident W.W. Finley Jr. expressed con-
cern overt he scope and funding for the proposed LRDP. 

The LRDP "leaves readers with the impression 

By Ben Templeton & Tom Forman 

that the University exists in a different world." he said. 
It hfails completely to recognize the lack offunds 

, .. To proceed with the plan would exacerbate" the 
already existing problems, Finley said . 

Finley recommended more community represen-
tation on the LRDP committee and more reflection on 
the negative impact of the plan on the community. 
Finley said it was as though the plan was "prepared in a 
vacuum." 

Other La Jolla residents including Eva Richman, 
president of the La Jolla Farm Home Association, and 
Benny Chien of the La Jolla Planning Association cited 
traffic problems and student housing problems that 
would arise from the proposed plan. 

Stephen Bloch of the Recycle Co-op pointed out 
that the plan doesn't address recycling issues as a part of 
UCSD's future. 

Suggestions and comments made during the 
meeting or submitted in writing will be sent along with 
the proposed LRDP to the UC Regents in October. 

A copy of the proposed LRDP and Environmental 
Impact Repon is on reserve at Central Library.

UC to Expand EAP Program In Japan 

The University of California Board of Regents 
recently approved a plan through which the University 
would more than triple the number of student and faculty 
exchange it maintains in Japan under the Education 
Abroad Program (EAP). 

Approval of the plan to increase the number of 
programs in Japan from four to as many as 13 came to the 
Board's monthly meeting held at UCLA. 

The plan authorizes EAP officials to negotiate 
separate agreements with many of Japan ' s major national 
universities and institutes of technology to participate in 
programs in the 1990-91 academic year. 

,..-------..., 

Despite recent expansion of EAP programs in 
Japan, the demand from qualified UC students and fac-
ulty for study and research opportunities in that country 
has continued to grow, exceeding EAP's number of 
available spaces.

UC Proposes Mandatory 
Graduate Health Insurance 

Guardian 
Internship 

By MELINDA HAMILTON 
Guardian Intern 

A mandatory health plan for 
graduate students is being consid-
ered by the Office of the President 
for the five southem University of 
California campuses at Irvine, Los 
Angeles, Riverside, San Diego and 
Santa Barbara. 

The committee, appointed by 
the Office of the President, cooper-
ating with the Graduate Student 
Association (GSA) and the Uni-
versity of California Student Asso-
ciation (UCSA), is working to 
implement a plan that would lower 
costs and increase graduate stu-
dent benefits by Jan. I, 1990, ac-
cording to Randall Giles, Graduate 
Student Association external vice 
president. 

The plan would be a mandatory 
registration expense for all gradu-
ate students. Giles said the Univer-
sity would exempt students who 
could offer proof of a comparable 
policy. 

Modeled after health plans on 
the other four UC campuses, the 
proposed plan will provide cover-
age for auto accidents, surgical care, 
physician's visits, necessary physi-
cal therapy, maternity benefits, 
medically necessary acupuncture 
or chiropractic care, mental illness 
or substance abuse and worldwide 
urgent care. 

The current UCSD voluntary 
health plan only provides coverage 
for hospital stays, surgical and 
laboratory fees, ambulance costs 
and physician ' s visits. The plan 
only partially covers major medi-
cal problems. 

"The current plan is good for 
most students," Giles said. "But 
it's not good for [auto] accidents or 
major problems. " 

Both plans exclude services 
available to students through the 
Student Health Services. 

Currently, graduate students pay 
$109.50 per quarter and $142.50 
for the summer quarter for health 
care. For an additional $179.50 
per quarter, the policy covers a 
student's spouse. Children can be 
added to the plan for another 
$121 .50 per quarter. 

GSA is pllll!Jling to sponsor a 
referendum which UCSD gradu-
ate students will be asked to ap-
prove in November. 

At least 20 percent of all UCSD 
graduate students must vote for the 
referendum to be valid. If two 
thirds of those voting approve the 
policy, UC President David Gard-

ner will implement it, Giles said. 
At the last UCSA board meet-

ing, members decided to pursue an 
optional health plan for graduate 
students, according to Dale Kelly 
Bankhead, a UCSA spokesperson. 

"We are aggressively pursuing 
an optional plan," said Bankhead. 
"But we have not ruled out a 
mandatory health plan." 

According to Bankhead, requir-
ing extra registration fees for a 
health plan may cause problems 
for some students and UCSA pre-
fers to avoid those problems if 
possible.

Up From Mediocrity 

Educational Choice 
The recent governors' conference convened by George Bush 

took a little of the spotlight away from the drug war, and onto one 
of the most critical problem this nation faces: the mediocre 
educational system. But that's about all the conference did; it did 
not provide the real commitment to the radical proposals neces-
sary to overhaul the educational system. 

"Magnet schools," which allow students to attend special 
schools with specialized programs, and other attempts at provid-
ing educational choice are appearing around the nation. In some 
school systems, parents can choose their children's course tracks. 

But is this enough? The real solution is a firm federal , state and 
local system of educational vouchers. Some people have attacked 
this system as elitist, or as a violation of the Constitutional 
separation of church and state, since many vouchers would be 
used at parochial schools. 

B.ut on close inspection, these arguments crumble. If education 
vouchers were given to parents, good for a set sum of money to 
any accredited school, public or private, there would be a great 
incentive for schools to be created. This would solve the problem 
of lack of school space very quickly, eliminating the need for 
patch-work solutions such as year-round school, and in addition, 
would ensure the creation of schools with programs to meet every 
student's need. The vouchers would represent each student's 
share of government's educational expenditures. 

Economist Milton Friedman has pointed out that each year 
local, state and federal governments spend more than $100 billion 
on education, roughly three times what is spent in restaurants and 
bars annUally. The much smaller sum provides establishments to 
suit every taste, so clearly many types of schools would appear 
were this money allocated to vouchers instead of the huge 
educational bureaucracy which has been established. 

It is also clear that many (if not most) of these private schools 
would be secular, thus largely destroying the church-state argu-
ment. Even if this were not true, it is an empty argument since 
under current laws, large amounts of government financial aid is 
used by students attending religiously based universities. In any 
case, prohibiting attendance of parochial schools by making them 
extremely expensive through double payment (one must pay 
taxes for public schools in addition to the private school) is 
restricting one aspect of the free exercise of religion, which is 
clearly prohibited in the Constitution. 

The elitist argument also fails. While some parents would add 
to the education voucher, sending their children to schools which 
were out of the price range of the voucher alone, this does not 
harm the system. Many of these students would be in private 
schools anyway, and there already exists a gap between public 
schools in wealthy neighborhoods and those in poor ones. 

The students who are not having money added would still be 
getting a far better education than they would at a public school 
today , and by having schools which attract people of certain 
talents and interests, there would be far greater integration than 
there is today, both economically and racially. This has taken 
place in the magnet schools. 

There would be no need for forced busing, nor the bullhorns 
and baseball bats New Jersey principal Joe Clark used to maintain 
order in his inner-city high school. The pride that Clark inspired 
in his school would become the norm. 

The private sector can perform tasks more efficiently , for a 
lower cost than can government. A clear example is when the 
government allowed private firms to ship packages, and highly 
efficient companies such as Federal Express were created. Even 
the Soviet Union and other eastern bloc countries have recog-
nized the virtues of the market. 

It's time to bring this competition to education, to help every 
student meet his or her potential. Allowing freedom of choice in 
schools is the solution to our present educational problems. 
Magnet schools are a good first step, and hopefully there will be 
further movement in this direction. 

Greeks at the Guardian ing elections. Think about it. Could the board, 
dominated by Greeks and respon-
sible for choosing the paper's 
election endorsements, endorse a 
non-Greek candidate instead of a 
Greek brother or siSler if the non-
Greek really was better for the 
job? We' ll see. 

Editor: 
While reading Anton Bittner's 

"Guardian Close-Up" in the 
Monday, October 2 issue dealing 
with Greek stereotypes, [ picked 
up on something that left me feel-
ing a bit uneasy about the relation-
ship between the Guardian and 
thecam'pus's Greek organizations. 

I didn't exactly feel that Bittner 
was correct in writing that the 
Guardian has a "Greek-bashing" 
reputation, bUI that wasn't what 
particularly irked me . What 
opened my eyes was the fact, 
proclaimed by Bittner, that "four 
fraternity members" sit "on the 
present board." 

Bittner failed to clarify if he 
was refering to the editorial board, 
but since that is the only board 
listed by the newspaper, it is safe 
to say that he does mean the edito-
rial board. 

A glimpse at the board 's names, 
found at the top of the same page 
as Bittner's essay, shows only five 
members. Fourth grade math 
makes it clear, then, thatfratemity 
members hold a majority on the 
board - four to one. 

Despite any journalistic codes 
of conduct condemning biased 
reporting, it will be difficult for 
the board's Greek majority to al-
low truly unbiased reporting of 
Greek news, whether positive or 
negative, simply because of the 
fact that they have strong Greek 
ties to their fellow Greeks. 

Face it, how receptive would 
Anton Bittner be to an article that 
- and this is only hypothetical-
uncovers a drug ring in his frater-
nity? On top of this, Bittner isn't 
the only Greek in the Guardian's 
top hierarchy who would be faced 
with this dilemma. 

My fear is obvious. Bittner is 
so concerned with "unbiased re-
porting" and "murual trust" when 
it comes to news about the frater-

BENSON 

nities and sororities at UCSD, that 
he totally ignores the other prob-
lem of an editorial board that might 
harbor significant bias within it-
self. 

I'm not saying that the board is 
biased, through. [ am saying that 
there is a definite threat the board 
and its readership ought to seri-
ously understand. The board needs 
to be conscious and on guard for 
bias within itself so as to prevent 
it.

Budget Smoke and Mirrors 
Editor: 

The number one problem in 
this country is Government debt! 
Next week 's bipartisan budget 
agreement should bring into ques-
tion the credibility of both Repub-
licans and Democrats in dealing 
truthfully with the debt. 

The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings 
Law IlWldatcs a steadily shrink-
ing deficit with a balanced budget 
by 1993, but there are loopholes 
you can drive a B- 1 bomber 
through. 

l) Under Gramm-Rudman-
Hollings the surplus in the Social 
Security Trust Fund can be con-
solidated with other government 
receipts in figuring the deficit, 
thereby making the true amount 
of the deficit. This year's surplus 
will be $70 billion. 

2) Gramm-Rudman Hollings 
only deals with PROJECTED 
deficits, the law sets no conse-
quences if the actual deficit is 
higher. This encourages the Of-

fice of Budget and Management 
to use overly optimistic forecasts 
in projecting the deficit so that no 
forced spending cuts will occur. 

3) The law has no provisions 
for "off-budget" items. Our gov-
ernment has over $100 billion in 
spending it considers to be off-
budget. In fact part of the Savings 
and Loans bail-out is off-budget. 

The true U.S. budget deficit for 
this fiscal year will near $325 bil-
lion, according to the International 
Monetary Fund. 

Libertarians believe govern-
ment spending should be cut 
immediately across the board to 
balance the budget. You simply 
cannot have continued prosperity 
on borrowed money. 

Do we want a better standard 
of living for ourselves and our 
children or do we want a lower 
standard ofliving than the genera-
tion now retired? As melodramatic 
as this sounds, it is our choice.

Thursday, October 5, 1989 The UCSD Guardian OPINION 5 

Do you feel that the public education system prepared you to 
succeed in a university curriculum? 

I think the public school 
system is improving. I 
know that when I went to 
high school they didn't 
have all these calculus 

dassesandexuasc~nce 
classes ... I know, at least 
where I'm from, they're 
beginning to offer those 
classes. So it seems 
they're preparing this 
generation more ...

Well, I don't know what 
the hell they taught me in 
high school, but I was not 
prepared when I got here.

school, you learn your first

little I know about the U. S.

Joe Orton's British Comedy Comes to San Diego 
By Michael Schwartz 
Hiatus Intern 
British comedy is becoming increas-

ingly hip. "A Fish Called Wanda" was a 
smash box-office hit and Monty Python is 
a hit on late-night MTV. In keeping with 
this new interest in our friends across the 
Atlantic, the Bowery's Kingston Play-
house in downtown San Diego is pre-
senting "What The Butler Saw," a classic 
farce by Joe Orton. 

The Kingston Playhouse, located next 
to the lobby of a hotel, is an excellent 
theater, especially for the first-time thea-
ter viewer. Sitting in the last row (the 
fifth), I was closer to the actors than I 
could ever hope to get to any of my pro-
fessors in lecture. This small environ-
ment proves perfect for such a play. 

The play takes place in the consulting 
room of a psychiatric clinic in London, in 
1967. Dr. Prentice, a doctor of question-
able moral values, opens the play with a 
highly risque interview with his prospec-
tive secretary. His nymphomaniac wife 
stumbles in at an inopportune moment, 
followed by a surprise inspection from a 
government agent, Dr. Rance. 

From there it is a wild, ludicrous series 
of events that brings about an ending 
that even the most astute audience 

possibly guess. 
Along the way you'll see men in 

women's clothing, women in men's cloth-
ing, and men and women in no clothing. 
There's even a glimpse of the "missing 
parts" of Sir Winston Churchill. 

The quality of the production is mixed.

The editors of Hiatus have 
decided that there are certain 
portions of the entertainment busi-
ness that are just annoying. Both 
Nancy and Patty feel that it is our 
duty, not to mention that this is a 
wonderful space filler, to point out 
these nauseating factors to the 
general public. 

We hate Hollywood's image of 
the "tough, yet sensitive" man. 
Today, men are supposed to wield 
an M- 16 while making daisy 
chains. 

it would be wonderful if televi-
sion and the cinema continually 
portrayed men as truly sensitive . 
Yet it seems that the caring aspects 
of their characters are merely an 
afterrhought in some writer's mind. 

A personal favorite is Tom 
Cruise in "Top Gun." Through-
out the film, he was your basic 
tough guy, looking macho in his F-
\4. 

The most touching scene in the 
film, however, occured right after 
his best friend died. Cruise tries 
his best to eke out a tear, his whole 
face trembling in effort. This was 
his "sensitive moment," and boy 
was it beautiful. All of his method 
acting training came out in full 
force . 

-, Another great movie tough guy 
is, of course, Rambo. This man is a

virtual fighting machine. Whole 
armies can't stop him. However, 
at the climax of every Rambo 
movie (well, at least the first two) 
he has a huge, emotional scene. 
Now, it's nice that the guy can do 
more then spray bullets on people. 
But really, it's hard to see him as 
multi-faceted when he is "sensi-
tive" for five whole minutes. 

It seems like the writers said to 
themselves, "Hey, this guy is really 
tough, but women may want to see 
some sensitivity. Let's throw it in 
at the end." Thanlcs, but no thanlcs. 
Either the guy is able to ruthlessly 
kill hundreds of people, or he has a 
heart of gold. The two elements 
just don't blend. 

Television's portrayal of this 
type of character is not much bet-
ter. "21-Jump Street" and its spin-
off, "Booker," are wonderful ex-

amples of the work of executives 
who want to appeal to the 13-
to16-year-old female age bracket. 

Johnny Depp. What more do 
we have to say! But even worse 
than "Dangerous Depp," is Rich-
ard Grieco as Booker. He is ha-
bitually sporring some skin-tight 
muscle sh irts and strategically 
ripped jeans. Often, the shirt is 
off, the chest is glistening, and you 
can just imagine who is going to 
make the next cover of Bop maga-
zine. 

Admittedly, the man has a good 
physique. (I doubt the producers 
of the show would have hired 
Grieco if he had a sunken chest.) 
And the show is an entertaining 
way of completely shutting down 
the cognitive processes. But the 
way he changes from tough guy to 
kitten soft is just annoying. 

The best example of this was 
when Booker faced the dilemma 
of having to trackdown the finan-
cial records of Mr. Bad Guy. In-
stead of trying to get the informa-
tion himself, he turns his puppy 
eyes and flexed biceps onto the 
local secretarial pool. Boom, in 10 
minutes, the records are in his 
hands, and the secretaries are-
drooling at his feet. 

Now for day time TV -in other 
words, soap operas. Now we know 
lots of people watch them. even if 
they deny it. "Tough Men" on the 
soaps are the worst. They are in-
variably strong, handsome, and 
dangerous. 

Yet, when they are with the 
woman they love, they become 
hopelessly romantic. They smell 
roses and spout poetry. Their eyes 
mist at the thought of being parted 
from their beloved. Of course, if 
this said beloved were being held 
hostage somewhere, these same 
humble men would become ready 
for battle, dodging bullets and 
punching out anyone who stood 
in there way. Realistic! Yeah, right. 

We're sure that by now most of 
you are asking, "if you hate it so 
much, 'why do you watch ?" We 
watch because if we looked for 
shows and movies con taining only 
truly developed characters we'd be 

entertained maybe once a month. 
It would be nice if there were less 
macho-yet-meek guys in the me-
dia and more realistiC ones

Comedian Showcases 
Film At Price Center 

By Christine Huizar 
Hiatus Staff Writer 

The first part of the newspaper I 
red is the obituaries, jUst w see if I'm 
sciU alive . - Vic Dunlop 

Actor/comedian Vic Dunlop is 
one of these rare persons that pos-
sess the gifts of comedic presence 
and an innate sense of humor. From 
his plastic "Crazy Comic Eyes" to 
the humor he instills in them, 
Dunlop is unforgettable. Dunlop 
explains, "The next time a reli-
gious freak comes over to you and 
says, 'Have you seen Jesus?' just 
pop these in and say, 'Yes! I saw 
him yesterday!'" 

Dunlop the comedian will be 
performing at the Improv here in 
San Diego Oct. 3 through 8. 
Dunlop the actor will premiere in 
his new movie "Wishful Think-
ing" Oct. 8 at the UCSD Price 
Center. 

Dunlop first began his comedy 
career fourteen years ago. In a 
recent interview, he said, "Me and 
some friends put rogether an im-
provisational group which we 
called 'Natural Gas.' It had noth-
ing to do with Mexican food." 

The group did some "Saturday 
Night Live" type bits that were 
ahead of their time. Dunlop added, 
"When there was the air crash in 
the Andes and the people were 

eating each other, we wrote a thing 
called 'Human Helper.' We got it 
on but we got ton of letters." 

At about this time, Dunlop was 
persuaded to attempt stand-up 
comedy on his own. After winning 
third place in the prominent Los 
Angeles Stand-Up Competition, 
he quickly found his niche when 
he realized that the winner of the 
competition used all the material 
Dunlop wrote for him. 

Dunlop's material is drawn from 
different elements in his past. 
About his marriage, he says that 
"the most daring thing I've ever 
done is marry a woman with two 
children and about a hundred rela-
tives from the hills of Tennessee 
and Kentucky." 

Thirteen years of Catholic 
school helped him cope with his 
stint in Viemam.Dunlopexplains, 
"Training with biker nuns who 
were born to raise Lazarus made 
me well prepared for Vietnam .. . 
You enter an eighteen-year-old 
Catholic boy and leave a fool, a 
fool with an edge. 

"1(1 couldn't do what I'm doing 
I'd love to be a burden to society, 
living off of unemployment, wel-
fare, food stamps, Medicare and 
fathering children all over the 
country," Dunlop says. 

Dunlop's future looks bright, 
very bright in facr. Guest spots on 
VH1, Arsenio Hall, and appear-

ances in a slew of new movie:; 
assure his continued notoriety. 
Along with the movie "Wishful 
Thinking" is"MartiansGo Home," 
an urgent and provocative science 
fiction comedy which is awaiting 
release. 

Dunlop'S biggest project todate 
is "What's Happening to Waited" 
which he starred in and co-wrote. 
"It's a black comedy feature, a film 
with an edge," Dunlop explained. 
"If you've got an edge, go see it." 

The comedian speaks of one of 
the crazy incidents that happened 
on the set of "What's Happening 
to Walter?" 

"There is this scene in the film 
which requires everyone around 
me to be repulsed. So to prepare 
for this particular scene, I went on 
my own and chose not to brush my 
teeth for a week prior to the scene. 

"Well, when you see the film 
and look at the faces of these people 
when I open my mouth to say my 
lines, you realize these people aren't 
acting. This is their real reaction. 
It's really quite funny." 

Although Dunlop has been 
enjoying his work in film and tele-
vision, he continues to tour the 
United States, headlining at 
comedy clubs with an occasional 
stop in Las Vegas showrooms. He 
has opened for Gladys Knight and 
the Pips, the Temptations, and 
the Four Tops. 

Two of the few things Dunlop 
takes seriously in life are his career 
and his family. With one to an-
chor the intensity of the other, 
Dunlop is headed towards refresh-

The Stray Cats 
Rock This Town 

By Brian Dias 
Hiatus Intern 

After several years off, the Stray 
Cats are back with a new album, 
an international tour, and a bit of 
terrorism. 

headed for the new and creative 
music scene in England. 

After two successful albums, The 
StTay C/US and Gonna Ball, the 
Cats once again packed their bags, 
but this time they headed back for 
the States armed with a compila-
tion album called Built Far Speed. 

After a string of hits and two 
domestic albums, the Stray Cats 
were riding high, but what hap-
pened! According to Rocker, the 
Cats "just became burned out on 

as Rockersays, "The same week we 
recorded Rock Therapy, Jim and I 
were in the studio recording Phan-
rom, Rocker and Slick." 
. So, after several years off, the 
Stray Cats are back. As Rocker 
says, "We had worked together 

guitar pioneer Les Paul, the Stray 
Cats decided to do it again. And 
they came back as fired up as ever. 
Rocker explained, "On the first 
day, we wrote about six or seven 
songs in four hours. It was like the 
flood gates opened. It was stuff 

This time around, much like 
last time, the Stray Cats are find-
ing their initial success in Europe. 
They generally play to 10 or 15 
thousand people per night, as 
opposed to a few hundred to a 
couple thousand here in the States. 

Yes, it is true, the Cats are back 
and as rockin' as ever. That heavy-
duty rockabilly sound with the 
twanging guitar, slapping bass and 
the pounding drums which you 
may have fo rgotten smce your 
junior high schoot day, is as fresh 
and straightforward as it ever was. 
In a recent phone interview with 
Stray Cats' bassist, Lee Rocker, I 
found out what's old and new with 
the band. 

While their record company, 
EMI America, was going out of 
business, they released a seldom-
heard album entitled Rock Ther-
apy. 

The Stray Cats: Slim Jim Phantom, Brian Setzer and Lee Rocker 

About 10 years ago the Stray 
Cats - Rocker, vocalist Brian 
Setzer and drummer Slim Jim 
Phantom -packed their bags and 

Unfortunately, this album re-
ceived little promotion and the 
Cats themselves were all heavily 
involved in other projects. In fact, 

since we were little kids, we grew 
up together, and after a few years 
apart we really just missed the 
music and each other." 

After playing at a benefit for 

that just came out so easily and 
stuff that I don't think we ever 
would have written for our solo 
stuff, it was really Stray Cats stuff 
waiting under the surface."

4 HIATUS OCTOBER 5 1989 

The Cats' latest album, Blast 
Off. is a great. straight ahead rock-
abilly album. Unfortunately, it 
hasn't rocketed up the charts like 
Built For Speed did some seven 
years ago. 

When asked if the record com-
pany is pressuring them to produce 
a Top Forty Single, Rocker re-
sponded, "There is always that kind 
of pressure, but it is really self-
imposed rather than from the rec-
ord company. We can really only 
do the best work we can and see 
what happens." 

What about the Top Forty 
today !Rocker feels that "it's pretty 
sad. I don't think there's much 
going on out there. It's like some 
record company executive found 
some cute girl and hired a pro-
ducer to program a computer, got a 
choreographer to have her dance 
around in the video and they've 
created the newest sensation. 

There is very little out there 
that is legitimate, there are very 
few bands who, if they don't have 
a record contract, can play at the 
comer bar and have people enjoy 
and come back next week." 

The Stray Cats want to con-
tinue what they are doing and they 
should have a new album out in 
the spring which, according to 
Rocker, "will be a much heavier 
album like the sound on Runaway 
Boys." 

They are currently gearing up 
for a mini-tour of the West Coast, 
fresh from a tour of Europe. As a 
matter of fact, when they were in 
Germany. they were pulled over, 
held at gunpoint, and had their 
passports checked by German 
authorities who suspected them of 
being tetrorists! Rockabilly rebels 
maybe. but definitely not terror-
ists. 

The Stray Cats will be in San 
Diego at the Bacchanal on Oct. 9 
and 10. They will also be playing 
at the Iguana Club in Tijuana on 
Oct.8. 

If you have never had the privi-
lege to see the Stray Cats live, 
especially in small venues where 
they excel, I suggest you do so. It 
will certainly be one of the best 
live shows you'll ever see. 

It is exciting that we have the 
Stray Cats back and the band is 
just as fired up as the fans. As 
Rocker says, "The Stray Cats are 
the best thing we could ever do." 

Lee, you couldn't have said it 
better . 



The BoDeans 
Go Home 

By Laura Baker 
Hiatus Staff Writer 

Booooom! The crackling thun-
der of exploding mortar shells re-
sounds. A window shatters. No, 
it's not a sound effect from a Pink 
Floyd album. This is the real thing. 

The BoDeans put a lot of em-
phasis on conveying the energy 
and spontaneity of live music when 
they make a recording. "Fire in the 
Hole," from their latest album 

Home, really gives the feel of the 
experience they had in making 
the music. A note in place of the 
lyrics explains, "This is what hap-
pens when you make a record in a 
blasting zone." 

Home is the BoDeans' third 
album. The band was given free 
rein in calling the creative shots 
this time and the result is a solid 
batch of songs recorded in a style 
that captures the originality and 
energy of live music. 

"The BoDeans are at their best 
ina live situation, so we decided to 
record that way," says Kurt 
Nuemann, who, along with Sam 
Llanas, started the band. The al-
bum was produced using a mobile 
studio in an old warehouse space 
near downtown Milwaukee. The 
tracks were cut with the entire 
band and their amps in the same 
room. 

"It has to do with capturing the 
magic that only happens when a 
band plays together in the same 
rOOm at the same time," Llanas 
explains. "It also has to d0 with 
not trying to filter out all of the 
imperfections that give a band its 
sound." 

Nuemann and Llanas met in 
high school and have been playing 
together for almost 12 years. 
"When we first started playing, 
ELP, Yes and Genesis were real 
big, but we were mostly into the 
Stones," says Nuemann. like the 
Rolling Stones, their music reflects 
a variety ofinfluences: rock, coun-
try, blues and especially soul. "We 
grew up on AM radio, which was 
mostly Motown then," Nuemann 
said. 

They write all of the band's 
songs and produced Hametogether. 
like Mick Jagger and Keith 
Richards? "Whereas they call 
themselves 'The Glimmer Twins' 
we call ourselves 'He & He.' " 

They may not be as well known 
yet as the Stones but they have the 
music - and the persistence - to 
obtain the same level offame. Their 
last album, Outside Looking In, led 
to a six-week tour with U2,several 
appearances with Robbie 
Robertson's band and being voted 
"Best New American Band" in 
Rolling Stone 's Reader Poll. 

"We're not really into big 
company hype," Nuemann says. 
"When people hear of the BoDeans 
I just want them to think of our 
music." 

The BoDeans will be perform-
ing this Sunday, Oct. 8 at !he Belly 
Up in Solana Beach. For more in-
formation call 481-9022.

Stevens Wields More 
Than Just Hairspray 

By Joshua Odintz 
Hiatus Intern 

As the trend in hard rock mu ic 
known as "glam" approaches its 
peak, there has been litdecreativ-
ity and originality in recent re-
leases. Steve Stevens' new release, 
The Acomic Playboys, breaks that 
trend with an album filled with ex-
cItement, ingenuity, and raw tal-
ent. 

Stevens, the former guitarist 
and co-songwriter of Billy Idol' 
band, presents his listeners with a 
wide variety of hard rock that old 
Idol fans will understand. In a 
recent interview, Stevens said, "I 
think thi record is a logical step to 
where the guitarist who played on 
Rebel YeU should be in 1990." 

Stevens spent many years in 
the shadow of Idol without play-
ing the songs that he most longed 
to play. "I spent seven years with 
that guy and they were great ti mes," 
Stevens said. "I have the utmost 
respect for him . But the bottom 
line is, 1 was recording for him; 
they were Billy Idol record . He 
had the final say and there were 
some things he didn't like; ele-
mentsofmy playing he didn 't w;;.nr 
on his records were certain Iy ed-
ited out. ,: Stevens now breaks the 
chains that held him back all of 
these years. 

"At this point in my career," 
Stevens explained, "it's important 
to do a record that give me back 
the excitement I felt about a lot of 
music when 1 was growing up. 
That's why there's not one style 
prevailing on this record. It's re-
ally just blurting stuff out. This 
could create a lot of problems for 
me- itcould confuse the hell out 
of the record-buying public -or it 
could create something really 
great." 

"Atomic Playboys," the title 

track from the album, is a riveting 
cut which discu es the dangers of 
allOWing the military to control 
the power of the bomb. Stevens' 
hard guitar and vocalist Perry 
McCarty's gritty voice combine 
for the desired effect of danger and 
craziness involved with such an 
issue. 

Stevens got the idea for the 
song from an old film. He ex-
plained , "It came from a segment 
in the documemary film, 'Atomic 
Cafe: in which a general is sent by 
the government down to the Bi-
kini Atoll to assure the public that 
the bom bs they were going to deto-
nate down there weren't going to 
cause the bottom of the ocean to 
fall out. At the end of the speech 
he said, 'I'm not an atomic play-
boy.' And that immediately regis-
tered with me as a great name for a 
song and a band ." 

Most of the other 10 cuts 0 1 the 
album contain the power and clev-
er�y written lyrics which are Ste-
vens' trademark. "Evening Eye" 
confronts the problems of a boy 
who is lonely and confused, and 
(he use of blues style music gives 
the lyrics a more powerful mean-
ing. "Lonely boy burned by his 
mother / Out on the hot street 0 
young / Was a hot body night with 
aeaol operator / Packed up his life 
with a loaded gun." 

The second rune from the al-
bum, "Power of Suggestion," is a 
jazzy cut with a humorous Story 
behind it "Actually, 'Power of 
Suggestion' came to me from the 
back of Playboy magazine," recalled 
Stevens. "There was a mail-order 
ad for a Ii ttle cassette that had 
subliminal messages on it. The deal 
was, you invite some woman over 
to your place and put this tape on 
and it supposedly has subliminal 
messages like 'You want him, you 
desire him.' And the ad said, 'Be

the love Mephisto.' " 
The most riveting song on the 

album is a remake of Sweet's clas-
sic "Action."The combinati n of 
modern guitar and synthesizers 
redefine the sound and give the 
tune a Van Halen feel without 
disrupting the original version's 
power. The Atomic Playboys' 
version of "Action" i destined to 

become a party favorite . 
Stevens extends himself by 

singing the lead on "Woman of 
1,000 Years." His smooth, dark 
voice adds an element of mystery 

to the melodic guitar. Although 
this song could have become just 
another hard rock song, Stevens' 
use of intelligent lyrics and wild 
guitar solos elevate from that class. 
"She's a jet black Delilah and she 
knows the score / For the love of 
this lady men have gone to war /Is 
she a tear on the page of history / 
Or the blood in the veins of the 

family tree ." 
"Soul of Ice," "Pet the Hot 

Kitty," and "Crackdown" are all 
good songs, but they lack the in-
tensity of the other tracks. These 

ongs are littered with Van Halen 
style guitar and typical rhythms 
which do not reflect the true tal-
ent oi the Playboys. 

In years pa t, Stevens has been 
a guest 'ession guitarist on many 
musicians' work, ranging from 
Michael Jackson's "Dirty Diana" 
to Ric Oca ek'ssolo album, but he 
said that the Atomic Playboys will 
hold his interests for the next year. 
"Afterthe tour," Stevens said, "the 
Playboys are going to record an-
other album. This is a band of 
talent, and we are going to have 
fun." 

Stevens also worked on the 
"Top Gun" soundtrack, for which 
he won a Grammy, and he has ex-
pressed interest in doing more film 
work. "It was a chance to work 
with Harold Faltermeyer who is 
really a very brilliant film scorer. It 
was great, a lot of fun." 

The Atomic Playboys are cur-
rently on tour and will be in San 
Diego this Friday at the Baccha-
nal. If this new band is as powerful 
in concert as they are on record, 
the Playboys could be the best club 
band of the year. AT, ,

is completely ineffective. The 
program loudly boasts that he is 
the theater's artistic director, 
which explains his receiving the 
role. 

The action of the play, for the 
most parr, hinges on his supposed 
lunacy. Elias lacks the energy 
necessary to make us believe the 
bizarre series of events connected 
with him. 

Luckily, he is surrounded by 
several excellent perfonnances. 
Allison Brennan is perfectly unap-
pealing as Mrs. Prentice, the 
woman who drives her husband to 
shout, "You know I can't endure 
the torment of being in your com-
pany!" 

Brian Salmon is stellar as Dr. 
Rance, the inspector who suppos-
edly is sane enough to judgesanity. 
A bundle of energy, Salmon yells, 
screams and prances his way around 
the stage, providing much needed 
energy to rhe dragging first act. 

Heidi Wilson is adequate as 
Geraldine, the secretary too eager 
to please, and John Blunt is suit-
able as the dim-witted hotel page 
boy, Nicholas. Rounding out the 
cast is Todd Blakesley as Sergeant 
Match. 

Although the first act is tedious 
due to the slow pacing and setup 
for later events, the second act is 
fantastic . With the weight of the 
play mercifully taken off of Elias' 
shoulders, we are treated to a hi-
larious parade of mistaken identi-
ties and a general state of hysteria 
involving everything from slaps to 
gunshots. 

The script is excellent. It is easy 
to see why Orton is considered the 
master farce writer of his time. The 
web of deception he weaves works 
perfectly. Director Eugene Kall-
man calls Orton "the thinking 
man's Benny Hill." This is clear as 
Orton provides enough sexual one-
liners and insults to satisfy anyone. 
Lines such as Prentice telling his 
wife that because she's so loose 
"they'll send you to the grave in a 
y-shaped coffin" got the play re-
moved from the stage shortly after 
its debut in 1969. 

Unfortunately, the show is 
plagued by the usual factors that 
affect an American cast doing a 
British show. The accents tend to 
fade in and out, although for the 
most part they are acceptable. 

At times the direction by Eu-
gene Kallman is ineffective. A good 
portion of the physical comedy 
falls flat on its face and the timing 
needs to be picked up at several 
points. "What The Butler Saw" is 
basically a mediocre production of 
an excellent show. 

If you enjoy live theater and are 
willing to put up wi th a slow first 
act, there's a real treat in store for 
you. Otherwise you might rather 
see the killer rabbit in "The Holy 
Grail" one more time.

Elton John 
Sleeping with. the Past 
MCARecords 

In Sleeping with the Past, we 
continue to witness the rebirth of 
one of the most prolific era-defin-
ing artists in pop. Having been 
rescued from the artistic cellar of 
the early eighties and Geffen by 
the pop album Reg Strikes Back, 
Elton John has returned to his 
musical specialty, rhythm and 
blues. 

From the dark, mystical "Sacri-
fice" to the gospel-type "Healing 
Hands,"EltonJohnre-expIoresthe 
spectrum of rhythm and blues. 
Sleeping with the Past is a well-
polished and well arranged mas-
terpiece that, fortunately,lacksthe 
unevenness in quality that kept 
Reg Strikes Back from becoming a 
huge commercial hit. Every song is 
well thought out . The album as a 

whole gives a positive image remi-
niscent of Elton John's mid-1970 
style. 

The tone of this album is also 
consistent with the new image that 
Elton John projects. Sleeping with 
the Past has a more mature, serious 
tone. No longer the flashy and 
flamboyant artist who defined the 
pop sound, he has changed his 
music along with his clothes. 

With the songs themselves, 
despite the fact that they are all 
r&b, Elton John has cleverly 
avoided the pitfall of having ten 
different versions of the same 
sound. Each is different enough 
from one another and from his 
earlier work to be appreciable for 
its own artistic merit. 

The album starts off with 
"Durban Deep," a moderately 
upbeat song containing an obvi-
ous condemnation of South Af-
rica. It is followed by the already 
sllccessful first single "Healing 
Hands," then to the beautiful 
"Whispers," then to the rythmic 
"Club at the End of the Street," 
and ending the first side with the 
title track. 

The second side starts of with 
"Stone's Throw from Hurting" 
with its salute to Marvin Gaye, 
followed by the slow and dark 
"Sacrifice." The album rounds out 
with "Never Knew Her Name," 

the RayCharles- inspired "Amazes 
Me," and the pOIgnant "Blue 
Avenue." 

The Elt n John we hear in this 
album is no longer the icon of the 
'70s who redefined the concept of 
superstar, but neither is he the 
same flat, Insipid artist of the early 
eighties. He has rediscovered his 
rhythm. Although it is a slower 
rhythm, the music that he and co-
writer Bernie Taupin now produce 
is easily the arristic equal of any of 
their '70s hits. 

The quality of this album did 
not happen accidentally. Bolstered 
and rea sured by the moderate 
success of Reg Strikis Back, about 
which EltOn John admits,"l don't 
think overall it was as strong as it 
could have been," he and Taupin 
sat down and rigorously planned 
out Sleeping with the Past. 

They wrote nearly twenty songs 
for this album and discarded any-
thing that did not fit the overall 
tone they were trying tc create. 
"We were quite cutthroat, in fact," 
Taupin states. KSo if a song didn't 
fit we'd discard it, no matter how 
good it was." 

Elton John himself is very 
pleased with the final product. In 
fact, he plans to playas many as 
five of the songs on his next tour, 
more than twice as many newsongs 
as usual, despite the fact that the 
music will be unfamiliar with his 
audience. "It's like finding a new 
beginning," the singer stated in a 
recent interview. "If Reg Strikes 
Back was the start of a new birth for 
me in a lot of ways, I feel this new

Imagine that the Bearles (of 
the White Album period) met with 
Simon and Garfunkel to cut an 
album. Add some truly psyche-
delic music and the product is a 
British band, the SlOne Roses. 
Unfortunately, as the album shows, 
this style doesn't always succeed. 

After an initial listen to the 
band's self-titled debut album, it's 
obvious the Manchester quartet 
has a lot of raw musical talent. 
This is best displayed on the 
album's last cut, "I am the Resur-
rection." This song is the crown-
ing point of the album, for it con-
tains hard, moving gu itar solos and 
a solid rh~thm section. Singer Ian 
Brown's voice truly moves his 
audience back to the J im Morrison 
days oflove and confusion. U nfor-

tunately, "Resurrec ti on " will 
probably not make the radio, due 
to its length o f over eIght m inures. 

However, the rest of the album 
is not nearly as strong. On many 
songs, Brown's lyrics are drowned 
out by the drums and bass. Guitar-
ist John Squire's solos are timid, 
and his rhythm guitar is barely 
heard. In some cases, this (. rmula 
is able to create a unique my tique, 
but the sound is not consistent 
throughout the album. 

"Elephant Stone," the first 
single by the Roses, successfully 
uses this formula to create a good 
psychedelic dance song. A perfect 
balance of a solid drum beat and 
blues-style bass create an aura 
unheard in dance music since the 
early seventies. In "Bye Bye Bad-
man," the Roses formula falls on 
its face, and instead of a beautiful 
tune, the Roses leave their audi-
ence with a mushy Bearles-style 
song that doesn't work. In most 
points of the song, it's even impos-
sible to hear Brown's voice above 
the music. 

I n other cases, the Roses rely on 
their college radio contemporar-
ies. "(Song for My) Sugar Spun 
Sister" tries to copy R.E.M. 's early 
underground sound, but instead of 
creating a "Superman," the end 
result is a mellow song for rainy 
days. "She Bangs the Drum" is 
another attempt at club-esque 
dance music, but the song is miss-
ing the movement and rhythm of 
"Elephant Stone."

album are two delightful tunes. 
"Made of Stone" is very melodic 
and captures the essence of de-
pression in its guitar and lyrics. 
The solo is beautiful and illus-
trates a good use of effects to create 
a unique Roses sound. 

"Waterfall" also captures this 
sound through the use of Simon 
and Garfunkel rhythm guitar and 
a Scottish style solo. Brown's voice 
is strong and honest, almost as if 
he is baring his soul to his listeners. 

for the good tunes, the Stone Roses 
show promise for the future. 

Eurythmics

Hiatus Intern 

We Too Are One 
Arista Records 

One. Eurythmics have putout such 
notables as "Here Comes the Rain 
Again," "Who's That Girl?," 
"Would I Lie To You," "Mission-
ary Man," "I Need a Man" and 
their breakthrough hit from back 
in 1983, "Sweet Dreams (Are Made 
Of This)." 

Eurythmics draw on all of this 
rich history to create an album 
much like a greatest hits album, 
yet with no underlying cohesive-
ness other than existing as a show-
case for the considerable talent of 
Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart. 

That considerable talent has 
not been channelled solely into 
Eurythmics, either. Lennox has 
recently worked with AI Green, in 
addition to trying her hand at 
acting. 

likes of Tom Petty, Mick Jagger, 
and Bob Dylan. 

This outside work sits just fine 
with Stewart, who says that "there 
are people who want Annie to sing 
on their records or act in their 
films; people who want me to write 
or play or produce with them, 
which is great. All this working 
with other artists only adds fuel 
and fire to Eurythmics." 

Of This) . 
Lennox describes it best by 

saying, "I'm just always asking 
questions about value and the 
nature of things. We don't have 
solutions. Our music is based on 
opposition. It's about the friction 
between pain and beauty." 

This contrast plays heavily in 
the last two tracks about love, "You 
Hurt Me (and I Hate You)" and 
their current release, "Don't Ask 
Me Why." The softer side of Eu-
rythmics comes through in "An-
gel" and the soulful "When the 
Day Goes Down," two of the more 
melodic tunes to come out of this 
band in a long time. 

All in all, We Too Are One is 
pure Eurythmics. It encompasses 
their evolution · from unknown 
new-wave band to successful pop 
band. 

We Too Are One makes a wel-
________________________________________________ .........,come addition to an existing Eu-

That "fuel and fire" ignites in 
tracks like "Revival," "How 
Long r', and the pseudo-title track, 
"We Two Are One." These songs 
all recall the tough, almost live 
performance feeling prominent in 
recent Eurythmics' albums like Be 
Yourself Tonight, Revenge and Sav-
age. But what makes this album 
really work is the superb mixture 
of these tracks with ones that 
harken back to the early days of 
Touch and Sweet Dreams (ATe Made 

Meanwhile, Stewart has been 
building a name for himself be-
hind the scenes, working with the 

The Stone Roses' use of the 
sixties sound is not new, but they 
are able to master it in only a few 
songs. In one case, they have suc-
ceeded in creating a possible clas-
sic. Although the majority of the 
album is weak and sounds like filler

Recycling Co-op Works to Preserve Natural Resources 

Members cite two goals: "To recycle on campus and increase environmental awareness." 

By JULIE HEIMLER 
StaffWritu 

The colorfUlly-decorated 
recycling bins that have been 
sprouting up around campus 
recently are not the only figures to 
surface on the environmental scene. 

Graduate student Steve Bloch 
and Muir senior David Dickey are 
two core members of UCSD's 
Recycling Cooperative, a student 
organization whose main purpose, 
according to Bloch, is "to recycle 
on campus and increase 
environmental awareness and 
issues among students." 

The co-op has placed bins 
around campus to collect 
newspapers, glass and aluminium 
cans. Members of the co-op then 
gather the contents of the bins, 
consolidate the material at their 
storage shed on campus, and then 
sell it to a recycling company in 
Solana Beach. 

The money earned from the 
recycling bins helps cover the co-
op 's operat ing expenses and 
donations to environmental 
associations. 

According to co-op members, 
the response generated so far has 
been positive. Muir College has 
already initiated a program 
whereby students livingoncampus 
recycle items according to their 
residence hall or apartment. In a 
October 2 letter to the Guardian, 
the co-op praised Mu ir College for 

Rubes 

instigating its recycling program. 
Among the co-op's regular 

events are Wednesday meetings, 
during which members discuss 

The Recycling Co-
op regrets that the 
attitude many peo-
ple have towards the 
environment is 
"NIMBY." That is, 
they are concerned 
but insist that the 
recycling take place 
"Not In My Back 
Yard." 

upcoming projects and voice 
concerns about a variety of 
environmental subjects. Meetings 
are held weekly, as are Friday 
aftemoon "work parties," which 
consist of trips to various on-
campus computer terminals to 
collect discarded computer paper 
for recycling. Meetings and work 
panies generally draw 5 to ten 
members each time. 

On the first day of spring quaner, 
the co-op engages in a telephone 
book drive on campus to coUect 
the previous year's books for 
recycli ng. Targeting campus 
departments that receive lOormore 
phone books, co-op members

attempt to obtain the outdated 
books before they are thrown away. 
Members pull out al1 the stops for 
this annual event, which produced 
13 tons of phone books in two days 
last year. 

Bloch and Dickey use the 
acronym "NIMBY" (Not In My 
Back Yard)todescribe people who 
express concern about the 
environment yet fall short of 
supporting the presence of 
recycling bins in their immediate 
surroundings. Bloch explained that 
at UCSD, the administration allows 
the Recycling Co-op to place bins 
next to parking lots but has resisted 
their placement at certain other on-
campus sites. 

Bloch and Dickey believe that 
there is an unwillingness on the 
administration's pan to place bins 
at the Price Center or near Central 
Library because photos of these 
UCSD landmarks often appear in 
the General Catalog and elsewhere 
and "having recycling bins in the 
picture does not look glitzy." Bloch 
and Dickey feel that this regulation 
is unfortunate in light of the amount 
of aluminium generated in these 
areas. 

Another factor contributing to 
the success or failure of recycling 
efforts is public participation. 
According to Bloch and Dickey, 
" people have to stop thinking of 
the recyclable objects as trash and 
think of [them) as a valuable 
resource." 

The co-op maintains a bulletin 
board next tothe Food Co-op in the 
Student Center on which it posts 
environmental news clippings and 
repons of campus events penaining 
to the environment . 

The co-op occasionally 
sponsors guest speakers and is 
pleased with the turnout al the 

lectures. 
In addition, members go on trips 

tothe wilderness. 1lIese informal 
outings involve both work and 
relaxation. During the trips to desert 
and IllOWltain areas,theco-op picks 
up garbage campers have left 
behind, sorting out the recyclable 
materials and discarding the 
remainder. Being in natural 
surroundings also serves to remind 
members of what they are trying 10 
preserve. 

Although the co-op's 
constitution states that its 
jurisdiction is limited to the UCSD 
campus, Bloch and Dickey are 

concerned about the San Diego 
area as a whole. 1lIey hope that, in 
the near future, all of San Diego 
will instigate curbside recycling, a 
practice which University City has 
recently adopted as apiJotprogram. 
In the first month of operation, that 
city's program witnessed a 90 
percent participation rate. 

At UCSD's upcoming Fall 
Festival on the Green (ffog), the 
Recycling Co-op will have a booth 
at which members will answer 
perspective members ' questions 
and encourage people to sign a 
petition in support of a current 
wildlife protection act.

ARIAS 
Continued from page 1 

Arias also spoke o n thi s 
Tuesday's attempted coup in Pan-
ama and said he hopes the unrest 
there will not have a destabilizing 
effect in his own country. 

.. As a Costa Rican, I'm worried 
about what is happening in Pan-
ama, for we have a common bor-
der. However, this was not the first 
coup d'etat; it will not be the last. 

"As long as the Latin Ameri -
cans cannot choose their govern-
ment in the ballot box, we won't be 
able to establish [stability in those 
countries)." he said. 

"Sooner or later the Panama-
nian government has to find a 
democratic path. I am in favor of 
diplomatic pressure to encourage 
them to take that path," Arias said. 

According to Arias, what hap-
pened Tuesday shows that many 
officers in the Panamanian army 
are not happy being associated with 
an army funded by drugs. 

Before being elected President 
of the Republic of Costa Rica in 
1986, Arias twice served as the 
general secretary of the National 
Liberation Party in that country. 

In the first two years of his 
presidency, Arias authored the 
August 1987 treaties and subse-
quent pacts known as the Arias 
Peace Plan. 

The Costa Rican president will 
next address the United Nations on 
Tuesday and will be speaking in 
Palo Alto on Thursday, said a 
spokesperson. 

1lIe Institute of the Americas, 
located on the UCSD campus, is an 
independent organization which 
sponsors private programs and 
public events concerning Central 
and South America.

COLLEGE 
Continued from page 10 
more, students would not be eli-
gible for the NFL draft until they 
graduated. and the alhletic de pan-
ment would be subject to the same 
financial scru tiny as any other 
department at that particular 
school. 

Butthere are problems with this 
plan. 

In order to make Ihis new sys-
tem fair, the NFL must be required 
to hold two drafts - one for each 
league. That way. athletes electing 
to stay in school- while keeping 
thier career hopes on the gridiron 
alive-would not be punished for 
their choice. 

The college ranks of Division I 
-should this proposal go into 
effect - wou Id suddenly resemble 
today's Division II and III ranks 
where there' is plenty of talent but 
the primary focus is on academics. 
However, if the NFL had to draft 
from these ranks once a year. then 
the best student-athletes would still

get their shot at the NFL. 
Another important step that has 

10 be taken would be the implem-
entation of random drug lesting in 
sports at all levels. Athletes caught 
should be barred fOf one year with 
the first offense. and for life on the 
second with no parole. Today's 
sentences are ridiculous. and the 
athletes have no stand with the cry 
"unconstitutional". Substance-
abusers are breaking the law and 
abusing their status as heroes in 
today' s society. 

With these steps added to Mr. 
Telander's plan. college football 
- and other college spons as well 
- could pull themselves out ofthe 
pit of ('orruption and despair that 
they have plunged into.

USC Downs Tritons in 
Men's Water Polo 
By DANA CHAlKEN 
Associate Sports Editor 

UCSD's men's water polo team spent the 
week gearing up for seventh-ranked USC, 
but their upset hope ran out of gas last night 
when they fell to the scholarship-powered 
Trojans 9-6 at Canyonview. 

Earlier in the week, UCSD Head Coach 
Denny Harper predicted a victory for his 
eighth-ranked Triton ,and in the first quar-
ter it appeared his prognostication might be 
on the mark. 

The Trojans opened the game by win-
ning the sprint, and wa ted little time when 
they scored their first hot after ju t 22 sec-
onds had elap ed. 

period during which the teams traded goals. 
USC tallied just 28 seconds after McCon-

ville did, and 40 seconds before his next goal 
which tied the score at 2-2. 

Sophomore Corbin Walburger followed 
Harper's directions to "shoot high" and blew 
one past USC's backup goalie. 

McConville threw things into high gear 
for UCSD, stealing two balls and scoring his 
other two goals. The last one came just 
before the halftime buzzer off a touch-pass 
from Jason Brown, bringing the Tritons 
within two at 7-5. 

A six-on-four power play set up Todd 
Sells, who split the outstretched arms of 
USC's regular goalie for the Tritons' final 
goal late in the third period. 

Triton enior Peter McConville came back

Gridiron Gridlock: Problems in College Football 
A Response to Rick Telander's Proposed Solution in Sports Illustrated 

By DAVID POnCHA 
StaffWriler 

Drugs. Violence. Money. Greed. 
Another article about gangs and 

drug wars? No. But another article 
condemning the sorry state of 
NCAA athletics-an article about 
a system that has fallen to such 
dark depths that even a high-pow-
ered submarine would get lost in 
the vile reaches of the murky ea 
better known as college athletics 

-most specifically. college foot-
ball. 

In a recent issue of Sports illus-
trated, writer Rick Telander pro-
posed a solution to the problem. 
The article was an excerpt from his 
book "The Hundred Yard Lie," 
and outlined 18 steps that he felt 
would tum college football around, 
and NCAA athletics as well . 
Telander's proposal is achievable 
- and would be a start - but there 
is more that needs to be done. 

In short, Mr. Telander wants 
college football split into two sepa-
rate leagues: a semi-pro league and 
a true college league. He wants to 
establish what he terms the "Age-

Group Professional Football 
League," or AGPFL. The league 
would be composed of Division I 
schools that wish to retain big time 
football (schools like Michigan, 
Notre Dame, Texas, UCLA, etc.) 
Member athletes will be paid a 
reasonable salary based on a set 
pay scale, the league will be par-
tially subsidized by the NFL, 
members of teams would not be 
required to attend that particular 
college and each college would be 
required to own its own AGPFL 
team. 

In addition, each member of a 
team not attending its associated 
college will receive one full year 
of paid tuition to the college. There-
fore, if the player finds out that the 
big leagues are an impossible 
dream, that person may enter col-
lege free of charge. 

In this league. a coach will no 
longer have to falsely proclaim, "I 
am making scholars first, athletes 
second." Let 's face it. There is not 
a Division I coach out there who

truly cares who the athletes are or 
what they become, just so long as 
they play hard and win the games. 
Another aspect of the league would 
be that the NFL could draft any 
player out of it at any time. There-
fore, if young college-age players 
were in the league, they would be 
eligible. 

But there will always be some 
who wish to play football while 
attending class - there will still be 
a need for a league where players 
can mix athletics and academics 

the way college football is 

meant to be. Teams would be lim-
ited to·four coaches, eight games, 
fall practices that could not start 
until classes began and only five 
practices per week with none last-
ing longer than 90 minutes. First 
year students would be barred from 
participating - so that they could 
get a head start on their academics 
- and there would be no redshirt-
ing. Athletes would not be allowed 
to receive any financial assistance 
that is not available to other stu-
dents from the school. Further-

PHIL'S ANAL YSIS ... Can anybody score against them? 
Anybody? Well, maybe - but don't count on it happening 
anytime soon. Of course, I'm referring to our women's 
soccer team, which has compiled a perfect 8-0 record-
with eight shutouts - while outscoring its opponents 42-
o this year. And except for a tight 1-0 win over UC Irvine, 
a Division I school, these women have not really been 
challenged. At all. And Cal Poly Pomona, despite being 
a Division II team and playing at home, probably won't 
either. Okay, so Cal Poly only lost 1-0 to UCSD last year 
- a year in which the Tritons went undefeated until the 
national title game - but UCSD has something else on its 
mind: a return to that final game. And believe me, the 
Tritons are not going to let anybody stand in their way, let 
alone Cal Poly Pomona. Hey, I'm not trying to put any 
pressure on the Tritons - but I really don't think it's 
possible. PHIL advises that you ...
