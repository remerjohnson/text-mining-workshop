By LINDA CHEU 
Contributing Writer 

The A.S. Council unanimously 
approved a resolution in favor of 
unisex bathrooms on campus at its 
meeting on Nov. 6. As of now, the 
only bathroom available to both 
females and males is in the Lesbian 
Gay Bisexual Transgender 
Resource Office. 

Written by A.S. Commissioner 
of Student Advocacy Brie Finegold, 
the resolution is similar to previous 
ones passed at UCLA and UC 
Berkeley. LGBTRO's Queering 
Discussion Group has been work-
ing on it for most of the school 
year. Through this resolution, 
Finegold said, the committee want-
ed to make the campus climate 
more inviting and convenient. 

The resolution explained the

Title IX backed in 
latest resolution 

Council hopes to preserve law 
in wake of gov't reevaluation 
By LAURA McGANN 

Senior Staff Writer 

In response to a recent federal 
push to reevaluate Title IX, the 
law that requires gender equity in 
federally financed athletic and 
academic programs, the A.S. 
Council passed a resolution in 
suppOrt of Title IX at the ov. 6 
council meeting. 

This year, George ' N. Bush's 
administration began question-
ing the effectiveness of Title lX 
and created a panel that is travel -
illg to various regions of the 
country holding open forum-
style hearings in which anyone 
interested in speaking for or 
against Title lX can do so. The 
A.S. Council passed its resolu-

tion to coinCide with the upcom-
ing hea ring that will be held at 
City Hall in San Di ego on Nov. 
20 and Nov. 21. 

The A.S. Council resolution 
calls for continued support of 
TItle IX because of the "numer-
ous oppo rtuni ties it has provided 
for American women and girls." 
The opportunities referred to in 
the resolution, in terms of sheer 
numbers, have grown at an aston-
ishing rate since the IIltroduction 
of TItle lX. 

In 1972 , one year before 
Title IX's introd ucti on , 
ESPN.com cited that fewer than 
300,000 girls participated in 
high school athleti cs, a ratio of I

Leaders from the UCSD, San

were present to commemorate 
the efforts of those who fought 
for the United States in foreign 
wars. 

Speaking for Betancourt was 
Captain Donald Bowling, com-
manding officer at Point Lorna 
Naval Base. 

Bowling addressed the impor-
tance of remembering our veter-
ans while also briefing the audi-
ence on the importance of a 
strong military in defending the 
freedom of our nation.

About 340,000 veterans reside 

in San Diego, according to the 
U .S. Department of Veterans 
Affairs. 

Opening remarks were made 
by Nicholas S. Aguilar, director 
of Student Policy and Judicial 
Affairs and the chair of the 
Veterans Association at UCSD. 
Aguilar not only recognized the 
retired veterans, but also the 500 
veterans who currentlv serve as

"There are evil people who 
are undermining our way of life 
and our democracy," Bowling 
said. 

He also touched upon the pre-

such as Operation Enduring 
Freedom and Operation 
Southern Watch in Iraq.

Heated debate 
ensues at FFL's 
'Case Against' 

discussion 
By MELISSA BANIQUED 

Contributing Writer 

A lecture titled "The Feminist 
Case Against Abortion" was pre-
sented by Feminists For Life 
President Serrin Foster on Nov. 6 at 
Price Center Theater. Abortion 
rights advocates, who distributed 
informational material prior to the 
talk, made their opinions known 
during a question-and-answer peri-
od. 

Anti-abortion sentiments of 
early American feminists, who sup-
ported life, provided the founda-
tion for FFL's argument. "The 
Feminist Case Against Abortion" is 
based on the feminist tenets of 
accepting all people's rights with-
out exception and rejeCting the use

Phy~oplankton shown to 
affect global warming 
A new study conducted by researchers at 

Scnpps Inshtutlon of Oceanography shows 
that phytoplankton, microscopic plants that 
free· float through the world's oceans, hold a 
fundamental warming influence on the plan· 
et by captunng and absorbing the sun's radi-
allon. 

Robert FroUin and Sam lacobellis, who 
authored the study, argue that radiation that 
otherwise might be reflected back to space 
15 absorbed by phytoplankton and results in 
a global climate warmer by 0.1 to 0.6 
degrees Fahrenheit. 

The new findings also refute arguments 
In favor of redUCing global warming by fertil-
IZing the oceans with iron, through which 
phytoplankton would be able to draw car-
bon dioxide out of the atmosphere, thereby 
redUCing global warming. The Frou in-
lacobellis study, however, indicates that 
increaSing he amount of phytoplankton in 
he ocean, which would probably be a con-
sequence of Iron fertilization, would actually 
Increase global warming because more radi-
ation would be absorbed. 

The study, which was supported by 
NASA, the Department of Energy and the 
California Space Institute, is published in the 
Journal of Geophysical Research. 

Scripps to study Mission 
Bay water movement 

As part of the Mission Bay Contaminant 
Dispersion Study, scientists from the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography will use dye to 
trac Mission Bay water movement Nov. 13 
through Dec. 24. 

The goals of the study are to understand 
where pollutants - fecal bacteria in particu-
lar - travel when introduced into the bay, 
how long they remain there, how quickly 
their concentrations are diluted, and how to 
Identify which parts of the bay are most sus-
cepllble to pollutants. 

City officials note that the bright red or 
green dyes, Fluoroscene and Rhodamine 
FVVT, are absolutely nontoxic and harmless 
to all SWimmers, wildlife and the environ-
ment.

UCSD scientist wins award 
for microscopic image 
UCSD School of Medicine researcher 

Thomas Deerinck was awarded first place in 
the recent 28th Annual Nikon International 
Small World Photomicrography Competition 
for his microscopic image of a small portion 
of rat brain. 

Deerinck explained that his winning 
image, which was selected out of 800 
Images submitted by 300 entrants from 
around the world, was derived from ongoing 
brain research efforts at UCSD's National 
Center for Microscopy and Imaging 
Research, where he and his colleagues use 
high·resolution microscopy to map the dis-
tribution of important brain proteins. 

With this information, neuroscientists will 
have a better understanding of the structure 
and function of the brain, which researchers 
use to study the causes of illnesses such as 
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases and 
develop potential treatment. 

The top 12 winning images in the con-
test are featured in Nikon's annual four-color 
calendar, displayed on its Web site, 
http.//www.nikonusa.com. and will be 
shown in a national museum tour in 2003. 
Deerinck's first-place award included $5,000 
in Nikon equipment and travel.

Fair showcases cultural research 
Students' projects examine current world issues 

By LISA MAK 
Staff Writer 

T he Cross Cultural Center and 
the Academic Enri chment 
Program presented the Sixth 
Ann ual Multi cultural Re earch 
Conference on Nov. 7, showcasing 
the research UCSD students have 
condul:ted in the last year under 
thc Mc 'air Program. 

The Mc air Program is a one-
year program under which students 
perform aca demic research wi th a 
faculry mcm ber, work at a SUlllmer 
intcrnship, and wri te and prese nt a 
scholarly research paper. 

"T he purpose of this conference 
is to show that there are people 
who are doing amazing jobs and 
amazing thi ngs with research, as 
well as being full-time students," 
said Armando Abanilla, a senior at 
Thurgood Marshall College who is 
a diversity peer educator at the 
Cross Cultural Center. 

T he first presenter was Cindy 
am, a John Muir College senior. 

Nam videotaped J- to 12 -month-
old autistic infants interacting 
with their parents during 15-
minute sessions. She created com-
puter models from the infants' 
patterns of soc ial interaction. 
From th ese model s, researchers 
will construct a robotic head to 
train infants in socia l learning 
processes. 

Susie Bennifield, a Muir col-
lege se nior, conducted her 
research while workin g at th e 
Moores UCSD Ca ncer Center, 
which devdoped educational 
videos on cancer for the deaf and 
hard-of-hearing communi ty. 
Benni field worked with her col-

leagues to distribute these videos 
by contacting churches, who were 
invited to participate by showing 
the videos . 

According to Bennifield, the 
church is a viable way of educating 
the deaf communi ty. 

"The deaf community has been 
neglected for so long, and the 
problem should be eradicated," she 
said . 

Brise ida Elenes, a senior at 
Revelle Coll ege, did her research 
on "how Mexicans became crimi -
nalized as progellitors of disease." 
Accordi ng to Elenes, Mexican 

" There are people who are 
doing amazing jobs and 

amazing things with 
research as weU as being

senior 

immigrants were blamed fo r sever-
al epidemics in the 20th century. 
She argued that politi cal, business 
and economic factors facilitated 
the blaming of Mexicans as disease 
carriers and that these stereotypes 
continue to ex.ist today. 

"A lot of the stereotypes that 
are around today stemmed from 
the past, and people conti n uc to 
have them," Elenes said. "I think 
it's just so embedded in society 

that we htlve :1 long time to go 
before we ac tually break those 
barri ers." 

J illian Medeiros' research 
focused on the decline of Gross 
Domestic Product volatility, 
marked by the stable growth of the 
economy for the pas t decade. 
Medeiros examined and analyzed 
GD P statistics from the United 
States, Germany, France and the 
United Kingdotll from 1955 to 
2000 . She concluded that both 
structural changes in the economy 
and improved monetary policy are 
responsible fo r the decline in GDP 
volatility. 

Maribeth Rui z, a junior at 
Marshall coll ege, prese nted biolog-
ical research on the interac ti on 
between protein kinase C and heat 
shock protein 90. 

Ruiz provided background 
information on each protein, and 
the methodology that she used in 
the Newton Lab to gather her data. 
This segmen t of her research 
fo cused on finding the specific 
region of HSP 90 that actualiy 
binds to PKC. 

"This was a reali y, really tiny 
part of my whole gigantic research 
on the interaction between the twO 
proteins," Ruiz said. "You never 
know wha t you're going to find 
Ollt. " 

Micaela Smith, Bra ndi Forte 
and Denise Pacheco all presented 
research on current educational 
systems and ed ucational reform. 

For her resea rch, Smith inter-

STEERING THE 
GOOD SHIP U.S.A. 

New Republican control of government opens a berth for beneficial legislation 
By RYAN DARBY 
Senior Staff Writer 

If anybody out there thinks the 
Democrats are the party of the 
people, then someone had better 
tell the people, because they sure 
aren't buyi ng it. As the American 
people mandated on election day, 
our national interest demands the 
Republican ideals of limited federal 
government and strong national 
defense rather than the Democrats' 
ignorance of international terror-
ism and lust for high taxes and lav-
ish expenditures. 

After all, what has the 
Democratic Senate accomplished? 
Militant Islamicists have waged war 
on us, and our economy is still 
recovering. The Senate disap-
proves of the solutions proposed by 
the White H ouse and legislated by 
the House of Representatives, but 
rather than offeri ng thei r own 
remedies, they have si mply done 
noth ing. 

Therefore, it's not surprising 
that Democrati c candidates rea lly 
didn't have very much to talk 
about. Congressional Democrats 
couldn't even get their act together 
on the war on terrorism, which for 
rhe laSt year has been the most 
importa nt topic to most voters. 
There are basically two factions 

wi thin the party: those opposed to 
war in Iraq but too squeamish to 
admit it, and those adamantly 
opposed to it but incapable of pro-
viding a berter alternative. 

The American people are smart 
enough to understand which side is 
obstructing the debate, so we chose 
to elect the real progressives in 
American politics the 
Republicans. A nation at war 
demands leadership, and President 
George W. Bush and 
Congressional Republicans have 
offered US guidance on national 
defense and the economy that the 
Democrats are either unable or 
unwilling to offer. 

The most urgent legislation 
impeded by Democrats is the cre-
ation of a cabinet-level department 
for homeland defense. This new 
agency would directly supervise the 
more than 100 agencies currently 
responsible for homeland security, 
including the CIA, FBI, Coast 
Guard, Border Patrol , Federal 
Emergency Management Agency 
and the Immigrat ion and 
Naturalization Service. The newly 
facilitated communication will help 
us rectify our current security 
threats, tl1\vart future attacks and 
quickly respond to major catastro-
phes. 

The House approved the legis-

The 2002 midterm elections 
mark a dramatic shift in 
Washington, D.C., toward the 
Repu blican right. With majorities 
in both the House and Senate, and 
a Republican White House, there 
is almost no check from the left to 
any plank of the Republican plat-
form. This single-party dominance 
will further damage an already 
weak economy and could pack the 
courts with ultraconservative jus-
tices for decades. 

Historically, the economy has 
done better during times of divided 
gove rnment, or what Ohio 
University economics professor 
Richard Vedder calls "government 
gridlock." Vedder points to histori-
cal unemployment rates, inflation 
rates and changes in the Dow Jones 
industrial average to support this in 
his book, "Out of Work." During 
gridlock years, unemployment has 
been nearly a fuji percentage point 
lower than during non-gridlock 
years, inflation rates have been over 
three percentage points lower, and 
the average DOW change is three 
times that during non-gridlock 
yea rs. 

Following a $1.3 trillion tax 
Cut that has gutted all the inroads 
into the national debt made dur-
ing the Clinton administration, 
the federa l government cannot 
afford to pay for many of the 
ocial progra ms that Americans so 

desperately need, not to mention 
the ever-increa ing cos ts for 
defen e after Cpt. II, without 
going IOro deficit spending. 

President George W. Bush is try-
ing to reinstitute the use of 
Reaganomics, but the country 
cannot afford a return to the eco-
nomic situation of the 1980s. The 
stock market and the economy 
never fully recovered from 
Reagan's policies until Clinton 
took over the White House and 
his fiscal policies started taking 
effect. 

Once they did, we saw the stock 
market hit record levels, a strong 
dollar, lower unemployme.lt and, 
in short, a strong economy. Since 
C linton left office in J anuary of 
200 1, the stock ma rket has 

(ON 
slumped, the economy has fa ltered 
and unemployment has risen. The 
money returned to the people from 
the Bush tax cut was not put back 
into the economy as expected, but 
instead went into savings accounts 
to protect families and individuals 
who are rightly worried about their 
economic future . 

It has often been argued that in 
a time of war, the country needs a 
united government that will not 
argu e over petty partisan poli tics. 
But the war 011 terrorism is nOt a 
war in the conventiona l sense of 
the term. lnstead, it is a war of ide-
ologies mixed with military and 
paramilitary battles. The best way 
to combat the enemy in this war is 

not on the battlefield , but on the 
floor of the New York Stock 
Exchange. The surest way to win 
this war is to maintain our econo-
my, and that, above all else, will 
keep our country strong. 

The Supreme Court is the other 
major issue in play during the next 
two years. With a Republican-led 
Senate backing him up, Bush can 
appoint almost anyone to the 
court. Justices Willi am 
Rehnquist, J ohn Stevens and 
Sandra Day O'Connor each 
have served on the court for 
over 20 years, and are over 70 
years old. All three we re 
appointed by the elder Bush. 
All but the two C linton 
appointees, Ruth Bader-
Ginsburg and Steven 
Breyer, have served on 
the court for over 10 
years, and were all 
appointed by con-
s e r vat i v e 
Republicans. 

If any of them 
deci de to reti re, 
and especially if 
three or more 
justices 
decide to, 
Bush 
wi II 
h ave 
almost a 
free hand to 
shape the 
Supreme Court 
for fi.lture decade. 

This could have a sig-
nificant impact on

rely upon this Republican govern-
ment to ensure its expedient imple-
mentation . 

Similarly, the American people 
clearly approve of Bush and the 
Republicans' handling of a terrorist 
threat many Democrats seem to 
pretend doesn't exist. The debate 
over Iraq is relatively simple: 
Republicans recognize the failure 
of previous U.N. weapons inspec-
tors in Iraq, but the Democrats 
think war can be avoided if the 
inspectors are granted full access. 

Among several problems, how-
ever, is the proven fact that Iraqi 
President Sad dam Hussein owns 
moving laboratories that can sim-
ply evade weapons inspectors, and 
there is no contingency for that. 
Coupled with the fact that previous 
inspectors were forced to divulge 
their daily destinations to Iraqi offi-
cials, their program - which was 

never permitted to search 
Hussein's enormous 
palaces - was conceptual-
ly doomed to failure. 

However, instead of 
pr oposing 

ways to fix 
t h a t 

problem, pacifist Democrats insist 
that for some reason the old meth -
ods that never worked in the first 
place will for some reason work 
now. If they think war is a poor 
solution, then they had better come 
up with a better one because this is 
a problem demanding an immedi -
ate solution. 

Then again , should we be sur-
prised that a party that doesn't 
know how to conduct a war doesn't 
want to enter one? Fo rmer Vice 
President AJ Gore wrote a book 
more than 10 years ago clai ming 
that our sport util ity vehicles are 
more of a threat than Islamic ter-
rorism, upon which former 
President Bill Climon firm ly 
declared war several times - pure-
ly rhetorical claims he never acnl-
ally followed through on, of 
course. 

Republicans will also succeed on 
an administrative leve l where the 
Democrats failed, probably on pur-
pose: judicial nominations. Of the 
32 appeals court judges Bush has 
nominated , 15 are sti ll awaiting 
Senate confirmation. That means 
more than a dozen federa l seats 
aero s the cou ntry are vacant 
because the enate chose to table 
the matter.

tribute to Wellstone 

Ed itor: 
"Wellstone Memorial turns 

into politica l rally" (Nov. 7 issue of 
the Guardian) is the most transpar-
ent example of politica l oppor-
tuni sm. Not only did the 
Republicans steal the election after 
Paul Wellstone 's death, but they 
also shamelessly denied his family 
and friends the right to mourn his 
death and celebrate his life. 

What is more obscene than 
their whining about the lack of 
respect shown for Welistone in an 
exuberant celebration of his life 
and work? Shame on them! They 
never understood, nor will ever 
understand, his passionate com-
miOTIent to true democracy. No 
matter how they try, there is no 
way they can tarnish his legacy 
nor the legacy of the people who 
loved and supported him.

Both sides of abortion 
debate have same goal 
Editor: 

I was one of the few men in 
attendance at a self-proclaimed 
pro-life feminist presentation 
Wednesday night, one of even 
fewer who was without the com-
pany of a female . I listened as a 
well-spoken woman proposed 
numerous, substantive ideas that 

would make life better for women, 
especially those who are pregnant. 
She explained in great detail how 
the practice of abortion was 
abominable to early feminists such 
as Susan B. Anthony and 
Elizabeth Cady Stanton. 

The entire presentation was 
trying to point out that there are 
many reasons not to have abor-
tions. Not once was criminalizing 
abortion mentioned either in her 
speech or in the literature provid-
ed. This points to the single 
biggest misconception of the pro-
life movement and the most glar-
ing inconsistency of the feminist 
movement (which apparently is 
now inextricably linked to the 
pro-choicelpro-Iife debate) as it is 
manifested today. 

Not all people who are an ti-
abortion want abortion criminal-
ized; the reduction in the occur-
rence of abortions is the goal, or 
rather it should be. This woman 
spent an hour detailing programs 
that would give women more 
choices than abortion and try to 
stop the occurrence of abortion by 
attacking its roots. As soon as the 
floor opened up for questions, she 
was lambasted by a campus femi-
nist group for trying to "take away 
a woman's right to choose." News 
flash : The only thing not men-
tioned in her entire presentation 
was taking away a woman's right 
ro choose . 

The speaker was criticized for 
"demonizing the National 

Organization for Women." Yes, 
N .O .W. has done a lot for the 
women 's movement, but not every 
feminist supports all of their liti-
gation-inspiring positions . I 
would urge any feminist to look 
into the Independent Women's 
Forum and see that you don't have 
ro suppOrt N .O .W. to be a femi-
ni st, and you don't have to have a 
vagina to be a feminist either -
something I 3m sure would come 
as a shock to many so-called open-
minded individuals. 

Why can't the new feminist 
movement a pproach this issue 
without hiding behind fear tactics 
talking about threatening women's 
rights? Why not embrace this 
speaker for trying to promote pro-
grams that give women a variety of 
alternatives to abortion, wi thout 
infringing on her right to have 
one? Why can't a movement that 
preaches against discrimination 
stop alienating males from an issue 
that is 50 percent related to them? 
This approach to abortion of the 
unified pro-choicelfeminist move-
ment alienates many who are sup-
portive of the true feminist ideolo-
gy: that a woman should have 
every right that a man has. 

Has no one stopped to consider 
that a woman's right to choose to 
have an abortion is not in danger? 
It is a constitutional right, meaning 
no legislation can be passed that 
infringes on that right. If it were to

I don't want to make the entire student population jealous of me (OK, we all know that's a lie), but 
my tattoo has magical powers. 
Though it is a small, mild-mannered 
tattoo by day (and night, too, come 
to think of it), my tattoo has the 
power to alert me when complete 
morons are within a five-foot radius. 

I know. If only I could learn to 
use this power for good. 

The other day, when I was walk-
ing across campus , minding my 
own business, I dropped my note-
book. So, like any normal girl with 
superhuman body art would do, I 
bent over to pick it up. 

Then I hear, "Jesus!" 
So of course, I jerk back up and 

start looking around, because if 
Jesus is walking around campus, I 
sure as hell don't want to miss it. 
But as I'm gazing about, trying to 
pick out which surfer-stud nt 
might be Christ Almighty, all I can 
see is this guy looking at me like 
I'm, well , the anti-Christ. 

Guy (eyes the size of saucers): 
"You have something on your ass." 

like, well, an ass. 
Me (not seeing anything out of 

th e ordinary on my ass): "No, there 
isn't. " 

Guy (sti ll scared shitless): "Oh 
yes there is." 

So I keep checking out my ()'wn 
ass like some son of circus freak . 
And I'm obviously gettin g a little 
pissed off, because if my ass is J() big 
that I can't eve n see enough of it to 
loca te whatever this guy is so 
freaked out over, I certainly don't 
want to hear it. Fuck that. 

Me (fucking that): "Well I don 't 
see it." 

Guy (moving closer to me to 
point at my ass - not the smartest 
move) : "It's right there." 

Now I notice two things: one, 
that Jesus Freak Man isn't pointing 
at my ass, he's pointing right above 
it; and two, that if he takes another 
step toward me I will be able ro rip 
his face off in one fell swoop. 

Me (pleased that at least my ass 
isn't huge): "That is a tattoo." 

Guy (extremely suspicious) : 
"Are you sure? It doesn 't look like a 
cattoo. n 

At this point, I decided to walk 
awa~·. After all , I only have 10 min-
utes between classes and it take me 
at least 15 minutes to deliver a 
proper ass-whuppin', which proba-
bly wouldn 't make this moron any 
smarter anyway. 0 I settled for a 
sassy eye-roll. Praise Jesus. 7he Guardian web:mes letters from its readers. All letters must be no longer than 500 r.<.ords. typed

every part our lives . In the near 
future, the court is going to 
decide issues ranging from habeas 
corpus rights for ci tizens of Arab 
descent after Sept. II to constant 
chall enges to the Rot v. U/ade deci-
sio n that recognized abortion 
rights. A Bush court would be 
more likely to legalize the govern-
ment's unconstitutional detention 
of countless ci tizens without 
charge or trial. 

In additio n, a conservative 
court , which is presumably what 
Bush would appoint if given the 
opportunity, would jump at the 
chance to overturn the Roe deci-
sion, giving each sta te the 
a uthority to dictate a woman's 
rights. Countless other issues 
will also come before the court, 
including challenges to capital 
punishment, school prayer and 
the possibility of another elec-
tions debacle like we saw in 
florida in 2000. 

Yet Democrats can take h eart in 
the fact that all is not lost in 
Washington. T he Republicans, 
although taking over the Senate, 
cuuld not get 60 seats out of the 
election. Under the Senate rules, a 
filibuste r, or an ex tended speech 
lIsed to ta lk a motion to death, can 
onl y be overridden by a vote of 60 
Ullt of the 100 votes. Because of 
this, Democrats can, even without 
a majority, defeat the most contro-
versia l of the Republicans' 
motions, from a tax cut for the 
wealthy to an ultra-conservative 
appointment to the Supreme 
Court. 

Looking ahead to the 2004 
presidential and cong ressional 
elections, th e Rcpubli ca ns have to 
be vcr\' careful over thc next two 
yt!ars {f they do not want to lose 
their posi tions to the Democrats. 
In 1992, Clinton 1V0n the presi-
dency and carried Democratic 
majo·rme to both houses of 
Congress. He governed frol11 the 
left for the next two years. In 
1994, foll owing the tradition of 
midterm elections, Republican 
majorities swept both houses of 
Congress. 

In order to accomplish any-
thing after the midterm elections, 
Clinton had to govern from the 
center. This turned out to be a 
blessi ng in di sgu ise. By governing 
from the center, Clinton margin-
ali zed the Republicans to the 
right leading up to the 1996 pres-
idential e lection. That 
November, Clinton defeated Bob 
Dole and became the first 
Democrat to be reelected to the 
\ Vhite House since Frankl in 
Delano Roosevelt. 

Full owi ng the 2000 presidential 
election, Bush was in the same 
position as Clinton was when he 
lIlovcd into the \<Vhite H ouse. 
Senator Jilll Jeffords' leaving the 
Rcpublican Party forced Bush frolll 
the right to the center, where e1ec-
ti rms are won. The new Republican 
Congress will allow Bush to turn 
b:lck ro the right, which could spell 
disaster for the president's h o pes of 
reelection. 

The 2002 midterm elections 
have made hi story. The presi-
dent's party gained seats in both 
houses of Congre s. Democrats 
are in a state of disbelief over 
what has happened, wonderi ng 
what they could have done differ-
entl y. But having a Republican tri-
fecta in Washington will do more 
harm than good to the economy. 
T he courts will be packed with 
ultra-conservative justices for 
decades. 

There is some light at the end 
of the tunnel, but a lot of damage 
can be done before we emerge 
from it . 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN nJESllAY, NOVEMBER 12, 2002 

SDSU students show disregard for First Amendment 
By MAYA LINSON 
Contributing Writer 

On Oct. 31, two dozen Muslim 
and Asian students protested 
agains t San Diego State 
University's Daily Awe for pub-
lishing political cartoons depicting 
leaders in their ethnic communi -
ties. The students deemed the car-
toons racist and demeaning, and 
after seizing thousands of copies of 
that day's issue, they rallied on the 
"Free Speech" steps to demand an 
apology. Reportedly, copies of the 
newspaper were destroyed while 
protesters chanted, "What do we 
want? An apology' When do we 
want it? Now'" 

Even if the cartoons were 
incendiary, the srudents' reactive 
impulse to silence the Daily Azttc 
by seizing as many copies as they 
could grab is censorship. Quite 
frankly, their action represents the 
oppressive tendencies found with-
in their cultures of descent. To 
clarify, if these srudents lived in 
countri es such as Iran, Iraq, North 
Korea or China, their voices 
would go unheard unless their 
message was sa nctioned by the 
state. 

This, however, is Ame rica . 
Free speech is valued so highly 
here tha t the srudents of SDSU 
named a section of their campus 
for it. In America, if an indepen-
dent n ewspaper publishes con-
troversial images, people ca n 
rally agai nst it , thus exercisi ng 
their right to free speec h. 
According ou r First Amendment 
right, they can even demand an 
apology. What they cannot do, 
however, is stifle the voice of 
another by attem pting to 

obstruct the 
di stribution of 
the paper. This 
act is hypocrisy 
in its cleares t 
form. 

T he first car-
toon, published 
on Sept. 25, 
depicted two 
camels labeled 
"Hussein" and 
"Arafat" and 
had a caricarure 
of President 
George W 
Bush in the 
middle . The 
second cartoon, 
publ ished on 
Oct. 22, showed 
an image of a 
large man wear-
ing a shirt 
labeled "China" 
and a caption 
addressing the 
North Korea 
Nuclea r 

LOCAL 

" 

that. After th e 
first cartoon, sev-
eral letters to the 
editor were pub-
lished and 
addressed in the 
Daily Aztu. In 
response, the car-
toon's author 
wrote to the stu-
dents who were 
angered by his 
first cartoon. In 
his article, he 
explains he was 
trying to create a 
forum in which 
students could 
exchange ideas . The students' reac~ 

rive impulse to silence 
the Daily Aztec by 

"The nature 
of political car-
toonS is to take 
issues and push 
them to the 
extrem e, hoping 
to draw readers 
into a debate," he 
wrote. "If I had 
intended [to rep-

Sel.zmg as many 
copies as they could 
grab is censorship." 

Program. The large man's dia-
logue was written in broken 
En glish and then translated in the 
caption. 

Why did no one take issue 
with the stereotypical representa-
tio n of Bush ' Bush was sketched 
in this ca rtoon as a skinny little 
cowboy who wears his initial on 
his monstrous belt buckle. What 
if this depiction of our president 
offends me? The answer is sim-
pl e: If I am offended by what the 
paper prints, I wri,te a response to 
the paper and make my voice 
heard as part of an open exchange 
of ideas. 

In fact, many students did JUSt 

resent all Middle Easterners as 
camels,] I would have labeled both 
camels as Iraq and Palestine, or 
not have labeled them at all." 

The dialogue continued when 
a representative of the Muslim 
Student Association and the 
Society of Afghan Srudents wrote 
a guest article in the Nov. 6 issue 
of the Daily Awe, in which he 
states, "Using an animal in the 
cartoon has absolutely no bearing; 
using that specific animal hits a lot 
of nerves." 

The cartoonist addressed this 
issue in hi s article two weeks prior, 
stating, "Why didn't I use another 
animal? A lion, tiger or bear as 

some have suggested? Well , let's 
JUSt say that it doesn't tit the con-
text of the message. Let's be hon-
est, I really haven't seen a pol ar 
bear living in the desert." 

Here is proof: Free speech 
works. A hea lthy exchange of ideas 
can occur within the context of a 
student newspaper. Screaming and 
yelling only robs your voice of 
credibility. To be heard, one needs 
simply to pick up a pen. 

I feel it was best put by Thor 
Halvorsen, executive director of 
the Philadelph ia-based 
Foundation for Individual Rights 
in Education, who said : "The 
answer to speech you do not like is 
more speech." Our intelligence is 
only tested and expanded when we 
debate, and if the cartoons created 
an arena for promoting intellectu-
al conversation, then they were of 
use to our community. 

We can be angry and outraged, 
but understanding the importance 
of an open forum is a prerequisi te 
for participating in a sociopolitical 
exchange. Because these cartoons 
gained citywide coverage in the 
SI111 Diego Union- 'Ti-ibllnt and on 
the San Diego Channel 10 News, 
thousands of people have benctit-
ed from the discussion . 
Apologi zi ng for free expression 
solves nothing. DiscLlssion, how-
ever, is the foundation of an 
enlightened people. 

So let's have a disc ussion. Let's 
promote g rowth and understand-
ing, not apologies and censorship. 
It takes intelligence and leadership 
to express oneself. Though it is 
much easie r, 1 suppose, to stand 
around and shout, "What do we 
want? An apology! When do we 
want it? Now!" 

Pro: Economic stimulus 
will now be a priority 

Basically: Tattoo leads to 
a questioned sexuality 

continued from page 4 
Largel y, it's a ma !ler of ideo-

logical disagreement : 
Republicans want judges who 
interpret the Constitution, while 
Democrats want judges willing 
to reconstruct the Constitution 
to mean whatever they want it to 
mean. If the Democrats disliked 
the nominees, however, they 
should have simply voted against 
them rather than se nselessly 
stalling the system; then again, I 
suppose that would have been 
far too productive for th e 
antiprogressive party. 

Economic stimulus will also be 
high on the new Congressional 
agenda . Thanks to the tax cuts 
Bush pushed through Congress, 
all Americans now have more 
money to spend, which makes the 
economy better for everyone . 
The brief recession we ente rt!d 
was mitigated by his tax cuts , and 
we're now returning to slow but 
increasi ng ly steady economi c 
expansion . 

Recognizing that the tax cut 
added stabil ity to a post-Sept. I I 
economy many fea red would col-
lapse, the Republican Congress 
may now vote to make the tax Cllt 
permanent, which would other-
wise expire in 2010. Many specu-
late that further tax cuts targeted 
toward investors and businesses 

are now imminent, which would 
give our economy the stimulus it 
needs for rapid expansion ; I've 
always found it interesting tllat lib-
erals fai l to mention that all save 
one of the Anlerican economic 
expansions over the last 100 years 
have been preceded by tax cuts. A 
mere coincidence, I'm sure. 

Interestingly, some of the 
greatest benefits our country will 
see will result from the 
Democrats' probable political 
suicide in 2004. The blame for 
their recent defeat has apparently 
been placed on the moderates, as 
House Minority Leader Dick 
Gephardt is stepping down, and 
ultra -libera l Nancy Pelosi is his 
most likely successor. This would 
symbolize a suicidal shift to the 
left, for the American public is in 
a very conservative mood right 
now, and extremists ra rely do well 
in na tional elections. 

This is line with me, beca use 
the Re publicans have so much 
work ah ead of them. The ball is 
now in the Republicans' court, 
and if Bush continu es to lead with 
the same integrity, wisdom and 
convic tion that have character-
ized his administration, then the 
Republican Congress will ensure 
the protection and prosperity of 
Americans for some time to 
come.

quite a bit.) When I asked why, I 
was told that it was because of a 
conversation two of my friends 
had on AIM, which went some-
thing like this: 

JOKER GIRL: You know, 
Carrie is a weird girl. 

TYPICALMAN: Why do you 
say that? (Already we can see that 
this guy is fairly clueless, because 
I am obviously weird .) 

JOKERGIRL: Well for one 
thing, she totally hit on me a cou-
ple months ago. 

TYPICALMAN: Oh my God' 
TVPICALMAN: I am flab-

bergasted' 

Now, obviously this guy is try-
ing really hard to imagine two 
chicks flirting (as most men do 
about 23 .h ours per day), so of 
course the next thi ng he types is: 

T YPICALMAN : Tel l me 

Letters: Abortion will not become illegal 
continued from page 5 

happen it would be overturned by 
the Supreme Court as unconstiru-
tional under precedent. What 
about if President George W. Bush 
"stacks" the Supreme Court with 
"conservative" justices, you ask? 
Would that be anything like the 
"liberal" court that made the Rot v. 
Wildt decision? 

Mark my words, the only way 
abortion becomes illegal is if a 

constitutional amendment is 
passed. Can you imagine three-
quarters of the states passing that? 
It 's about time people woke up to 
the reality that the right to choose 
is not going away, and that people 
who say it is are simply trying to 
glean votes from the women's 
voter bloc. 

How about pro-choicers and 
pro-lifers try to stop the occur-
rence of unwanted pregnancies, 

thereby keeping as many women 
as possible from having to make 
the agonizing decision of whether 
to exercise their constirutional 
right to have an abortion? I won-
der if abortion were perfectly 
legal and accessible yet never 
occurred, whether either side 
would then be happy. 
U nfortunately, I doubt it.

JOKERGIRL: Well, a couple 

of months ago, I was alone in the 
office and she came in and asked 
me for a book, and when I nlnlt!d 
around to get it, she started 
caressing my back and giving lilt! 
these sed ucti ve looks. 

TYPICALMAN: Wow. 
JOKERGIRL: Yeah, but the 

best part is that none of that ever 
happened. 

Well of course now we all feel 
bad for TYPICALMAN because 
his fantasy didn't turn out to be a 
reality. (Acnlally, 1 think 1 spt:ak 
for all women when I say: the hell 
we do!) But I felt prompted to ask 
him why he believed the story in 
the first place. 

His response: "Why wouldn't

My response: " Because yo u

One audie nce member asserted 
that the basic tenets of feminism 
that Foster named might only 
apply to the Western feminism. 
Third World nations, which may 
disagree with such views, are thus 
being neglected. 

fFL's goal IS to systematically 
eliminate reaso ns for abortion, 
most importantly the lack of finan -
cial resources and emotional sup-
port available to pregnant women. 

Many women say that havi ng a 
baby would ruin their lives. 

" Babies don't ruin people's 
lives," Foster said. "Poverty ruins 
people's lives. Unemployment 
ruins people's lives. A lack of edu-
cation ruins people's lives . Violence 
ruins people's lives."

on 18- to 24-year-

At Georgetown 
U niversity, where

agreed with FFL's 

Tyler Huff/Guardian 
Taking a stand: Serrin Foster of Feminists For Life urges 
women to rethink the the traditional abortion paradigm. 

Our collaborative learning environment prepares you to practice 
what we leach. From brief-writing 10 mock trials , national co mpe-
titions to externships, our programs offer hands-on training to 
succeed in the courtroom-or the boardroom-in a variety of fields. 

FFL en courages women to 
"refuse to choose," referring to the 
choice the organization believes 
women are forced to make between 
having a baby and having a career 
or an education. 

Foster emphasized the lack of 
resources available to pregnant 
women as the reason they have to 
make such a cho ice in the first 
place. At Yale University, students 
are offered three free abortions, yet 
they have no access to daycare. 

Foster also noted that it is rare 
to find pregnant women on college 
campuses, whether they are stu-
dents or professors, citing that 47 

motto to " refuse to choose," 
emphasizing the importance of 
still having the option to choose 
abortion. 

Much debate surrounded a 
story Foster told about a woman 
whose abusive boyfriend wanted 
her to have an abortion. The 
woman died from a botched proce-
dure. The picrure of her body was 
fearured on the back cover of an 
issue of Ms. 

Pregna nt women in abusive 
relationships are more vulnerable 
to violence , Foster said, which 
escalates during pregnancy. 

One woman criticized thi s as 
"anecdotal evidence," citing statis-

tics that a woman is seven times 
more likely to die while giving 
birth than during an abortion. 

Another woman disputed the 
relationship between pregnancy 
and abuse. 

"Domestic violence is not about 
abortion," she said . "It's about vio-
lence and power." 

A student in attendance from 
the University of San Diego said 
that students there agreed to have 
their own pregnancy resou rce 
forum. 

As a woman getting m arried and 
looking to attend medical school , 
she enco uraged UCSD students to 
partake in a pregnancy resource 
forum.

THE UCSLJ GUARDIAN TUE DAY, NOVEMBER 11, 1001 

Author offers insight on SD 
MacArthur fellow speaks on history of 'dead cities' 

By LAUREN RAU 
Staff Writer 

Radical urban theorist and 
MacArthur Fellow Mike Davis dis-
cussed his latest works on Nov. 6 at 
the Cross CuI rural Cenrer. 

Davis, a professor of history at 
University of California at Irvine, is 
the au thor of several books that cri-
tique the urban development of 
Southern Califol'llia. Davis is origi-
nally from the San Diego area, but 
has not lived here for more than 30 
years. 

Davis began by reading a chap-
ter from a book he wrote about the 
history of San Diego's urban devel-
opment. Apparently, when Davis 
left an Diego in 1968, he vowed 
never to return. Yet last February, 
Davis and his wife moved back. 

"1 wrote a littl e book this sum-
mer to reacquaint myself with San 
Diego," Davis said. "In some ways, 
San Diego has changed dramatical-
ly, and in some ways not at all." 

The portion Davis read aloud 
was about the Midwestern mafia's 
involvement with the expansion of 
North County during the 1960s 
and 1970s. This work is titled "The 
Next Little Dollar," which Davis 
said he took from the lyrics of a 
song by the musical group 
Alabama. 

"The lyrics go something like, 
'Show us the way to the next little 
dollar,'" Davis said. '''We must find 
the next little dollar ot we will 
die.'" 

According to Davis, the mafia 
invested heavily in the growth of 
San Diego. Numerous investigative 
journalists and prosecutors attempt-
ed to prove the connection at that 
time, but never fully succeeded. 
Davis pieced together this historical 
accoun t from those documenrs, as 
well as contemporary accounts and 
the vast number of articles and 

books on the 
Chicago mob. 

Davis plans to 
publish this work as 
an essay integrated 
with two other 
written essays and 
two photo essays. 
T he other authors 
are J im Miller and 
Kelly Mayhew 
from City Coll ege. 
The photographers 
are two UCSD 
visual arts profes-
sors, Fred Lonidier 
and Phel 
Steinmetz. The 
book is planned for 
re lease next fall, 
Davis said. 

This impending 
book is only one of 
many recent 
accomplishments 
for Davis. In large 
part, this is due to 
the MacAnhur 
Fellowship award 
he received in 
1998. The fe ll ow-
ship, unofficially 
nicknamed "the

Genius Award," is an honor given 
to about 20 to 30 people per year, 
according to the program's Web 
site, http;llwww.macfound.orglpro-
gramslftl/ftCoveroitw.htm. 

The Web site states, "The 
MacArthur Fellows Program 
awards unrestricted fellowshi ps to 
talented indivi duals who have 
shown extraordinary originali ty 
and dedication in their creative 
pursuits and a marked capacity for 
self-direction." 

The MacArthur Foundation 
awards fellowships only to individ-
uals, not corporations, businesses 
or specific research projects, 
according to the program Web si te. 

A stipend of $500,000 is given to 
each recipient over a period of fi ve 
years. The hope is that the money 
received will diminish finan cial 
burden or provide new opporruni -
ties so that these fellows will con-
tinue to produce new work. 

All types of people receive tI,is 
award, including but not limited to 
writers, teachers, activists and sci-
entists. The only requirement for 
eligibility is U.S. ci tizenship. 

Davis put his fellowship to usc by 
traveling the world . It has al so 
enabled him to write a new book in 
every one of the five years he 
received money from the fellowship, 
he said. His latest published work is 
titled "Dead Cites and Other Tales."

Title IX: 
Program to 

undergo 
reevaluation 

continued from page I 
in 27 . Today, the number of girls 
participating in high school sports 
is approaching 3 million, or more 
than I in 3. 

Proponents of Title IX argue 
that this participation has 
increased du e to the opportunities 
that the law has provided and has 
dispell ed the myth that women 
are not interested in athletics, as 
many critics of Tide IX argue. 

Co-author of the A.S. Council 
resoll,tion Senate Cha ir Corinne 
Hart said that she wrote the reso-
lution because she believes that 
Tide IX has been able to provide 
women with leadership qualities 
and hi gher self-esteem by provid-
ing them with an opportunity to 
play sports. 

"[The opporrunities] men were 
benefiting from and women 
weren't was not because women 
weren't interested, but because 
they weren't briven the opporruni ty 
to take advantage of them," Hart 
said. 

Ti tle lX was designed to pro-
vide opportunities to male and 
fema le srudents proportionally to 
an institution's gender make-up. 
According to the NCAA 1999-
2000 su rvey, however, women 
comprise 54 percent of enrolled 
srudents, yet only 4 1 percent of 
athletes. 

Financiall y, men 's athl etics 
programs maintain significant 
adva ntages over women 's pro-
grams in average sc ho larships, 
operating expenses, rec ruiting 
expenses and head coaching 
salaries , the NCAA says. The dif-
ference between men's and 
women's programs since the pas-
sage of Title IX puts women's pro-
gra ms roughly at $ \. 5 billion 
behind men's. 

Despitt: Title IX's failure to 
meet its standa rds ro the full 
extent, critics say that it sti ll has 
done more harm than good 
because it has led to the cutting of 
men 's athletics teams. They also 
argue that beca use of Title lX, 
many schools have had to cut men's 
athletics to accommodate women's 
teams. 

T he A.S. Council's resolution 
addresses this issue, saying that 
"Title IX simply calls for gender 
equi ty and the aim is not to dimin-
ish the impact or importance of 
men 's sports." 

Since Title lX's implementa-
tion, ESPN.com reports that while 
400 men's teams have been cut, 
more men's teams have been added 
than were lost. 

The A.S. Council's resolution 
firm ly supports Title IX , and 
members of council will be 
attending the Nov. 20 and Nov. 
21 hearings and pre-hearing rally 
at the Wyndham San Diego at 
Emerald Park Hotel supporting 
Title IX.

Eugene Gauran/Guordian STRESS TIPS 

D oes having three midterms in one day sound familiar- Do you find yourself constantly strapped for cash- Perhaps the 
fraterni ty or sorority i just not working 
out the way you had hoped. Or maybe you 
find yourself depressed over a fight with 
your boyfrlcnd, girlfriend or best friend. If 
you identify with any of these sentiments, 
you are not alone . In fact, you may be 
cha racterized as a typIca l college 5nldcnt. 

The reality is that almost all students 
at UCSD timl thcmselves stressed Out at 
times. Life at a major university can be 
academically challenging, as well as emo-
tionally and physically demanding. A vari-
ety of fa ctors contribute to the amount of 
stress that students deal with, but one 
main reason is that in college, students are 
often forced to experience life on a much 
more independent level than what they're 
used to. This transition to college life 
alone, whether as a freshman or a transfer 
student, ca n cause more stress on a person 
than he or she even realizes. In addition 
to homes ickness, any type of change can 
leave one feeling uneasy, especially a 
major change in lifestyle like movi ng 
away to college. T he genera l consensus is 
that dorm food hardly lives up to the 
comfort of a home-cooked mea l, and 
sharing a room the size of a closet is usu-
ally not considered ideal. When you add 
into the equation the fact that classes are 
lOti mes the size of what one is used to 
and students are forced to think on a 
whole new level, the net resul t is tremen-
dous amounts of stress, incl uding acade-
mic, social and emotional pressure. 

Aside from the obvious stress that 
classes impo e, some of rhe most common 
sU'esses, according to Dr. Jeal1lle Manes!!, 
director of traini ng at UCSD 
Psychological and Counseling Services, 
include finances, work and relationships 
wirh lovers, friends and family. These are 

juSt some of rhe most common factors that 
contribute to rhe immense amounts of 
stress that college students face each day. 

"'Nhen I work roo hard, there is no 
time for actual fun," said sophomore Lisa 
Kaufman. "Soll1ctil1le~ I get so stressed 
and so con llIllcd in my -rcsponslbilitlcs 
that I feel like I :lmlnissing OUl OIl rhe flln 
of a college experience. CCS D IS tiercc 
competition against the best students. 
Sometimes I work so hard for th~t 'A,' bUl 
then someone who docs not work as hard 
gets it instead of lIle. ow thats stressful '" 

Manese points out, however, that 
although these pressures often fet:1 as if 
they have a negative effect, stress C:l n be a 
po itive instrumcnt of moti vation for 
many studems. 

John Muir College Sophomore 
Senator J eremy Cog,lIl admits that he 
does work better under pressure and has 
produced some of his best poli tical sci-
ence papers at the last mi nute. 

"Stress is a fact of life," Manese said. 
"It is present throughout one's schooling 
yea rs and the rest of his or her 
li fe . Graduate students experience differ-
ent types of pressure, often regard ing dis-
scrtations or career options; but they too 
feel pressure nonetheless. The trick is not 
to eliminate the stress in one's lifc; instead 
one must learn to manage it." 

When asked if certai n colleges wi rh in 
UCSD or majors are particul ar ly more 
stressful than others, Manese maintained 
that rhe degree of stress students feel 
va ries from person to person, depending 
on rhe individual. He said that it is not a 
college or a particular major that causes 
one's stress; it is the man ncr in which a 
person copes with stress that is at the root 
of rhe problem. Manese also suggested 
that organization and good time manage-
ment skills greatly reduce anyone's stress 
level, especially busy college students. 

What is most important to minimizing 

and dealing with stress, Manesesaid, is that 
students maintain a balance among all 
aspects of t.heir life. Someone who studies 
all the time and never soci:l lizes is far more 
likely to experience depression, while a

Fear of the "freshman 15" and weight-

The nation's capital 
through student eyes 

Students tell of their experiences 
as interns in Washington, D.C. 

By LISA MAK 
Staff Writer 

Each quarrer th e UCDC pro-
gram sends a group of students to 
our nJtion's capital, giving them an 
unparalleled glimpse of the work-
1I1g' behind the nati on's politics. 
T he program, which has been run-
ni ng fo r eight years, allows sw-
dents to combine 'lcademic classes 
wi th an internship in Washington, 
D.C., while remaining enrolled at 

.SD. 
"The program has twO purpos-

es," sa id Shannon Roberts, an 
internship coordinator at the 
CJ ree r Service Center. "One is to 
give students career-level experi-
ence through internships and 
work experience. The other Ipur-
pose l is the academic side . I think 
th at both of these are good bene-
fits. " 

Students can earn either 12 or 
14 units for the quarter. The 12-
unit option consists of a full-time 
internship and an elective course; 
the 14-unit option consists of a 
pJ rt -time internship , an elective 
course and a research seminar.'

all over the capital to collect infor-
mation on state and federal agen-

"[ have always wanted to work 
in polirics, and being here, [ have 
experienced them first-hand ," 
Schiff said. "I have had the honor 
of visiting the White House . I have 
also had the pleasure of sitting in 
on Senate hearings and House 
committee meetings. It is in these 
meetings that [ have gotten to see 
most of the behind-the-scenes 
work that goes into politics." 

Schiff has also seen the more 
human side of politicians. 

"I also got to see the 
Republicans and the Democrats 
speak about makeup and perfume 
before the meeting began," she 
said . 

John Lebato, a junior majoring

"I am learnjng more than I ever

TUES[)AY. NOVEMBER 12 . 2002 THE UCSDGUARDIAN 

Graduate student curates 'Museum' 
Book was inspired by graduate dissertation 

By SPENCER PFORSIC 
Contributing Writer 

Sipping his coffee at the Grove 
Caffe, Alex Boese, "curator" of the 
Museum of Hoaxes, sits poised to 
answer inquiries. It takes very little 
prodding to get a wealth of infor-
mation from him about everything 
from his graduate dissertation to 
his publishing company. 

His book, "The Museum of 
Hoaxes," is a self-described "col-
lection of pranks, stunts, decep-
tions and other wonderful stories 
contrived for the public from tile 
IVliddle Ages to the new millenni-
um." Boese, a graduate student in 
UCSD's Science Studies Program, 
began work on the book without 
any intention of having his findings 
published. 

"You hear about authors send-
ing out to agents," Boese said. "I 
wasn't even trying to write a book." 

Rather, he was simply compiling 
research for his dissertation, The 
Mrt7llaid, Tbe Moon and The HoI/ow 
Eanh, a swdy of the relationship 
between science and mass media. 

He began his Web site, 
http://www.mIlIf1IlIlo!boaxeI.com. as a 
means of organizing this dara. The 
idea first caught his interest when 
he learned about the Great Moon 
Hoax - a story printed in 1835 by 
the NI!W York Sun claiming that var-
ious forms of life, including winged 
"man-bats," had been discovered on 
the moon . From this springboard 
discovery, Boese extended his 
research to all kinds of hoaxes "as a 
way ro procrastinate," Boese said. 

His Web site gOt so extensive 
that it became a well-known 
Internet resource for anything 
hoax-related. The amount of traffic 
it saw eventually attracted the 
attention of USA Ibday, which did 
an article on hi s research. 
Suddenly, he was getting calls from 
publishers asking him about writ-
ing a book. 

"I JUSt ended up going with the 
first one that called me," Boese 
said. 

His relationship with Dutton 
Publishing so far has Leen some-
what cursory, considering that all 
its representatives are in New York, 
and he's here in San Diego. He's 
never even met his publicist, Erin 
Sinesky, but he says she seems nice 
on the phone. 

Boese 's research consisted most-
ly of random luck. 

"I got a lot of material from odd 
references," he said, meaning that 
he could have been reading into 
one thing and then ended up with 
information about something total-
ly different. For most of the more 
recent hoaxes, he was able to tap 
into the LexusNexus Academic 
Universe, an enormous news data-
base that works like an online ver-
sion of a microfilm. 

One of his goals in writing The 
Museum of Hoaxes was to put each 
story into some sort of historical 
context. The book itself is orga-
nized in chronological order, with 
an introduction to each chapter 
explaining the significance of hoax-
ing in the given era. His idea was to 
"soft cell the history" rather tI,an 
bea t his readers over the head wi th 
it. Dutton intends to market his 

work as a "gift book" for the holi-
day season, a son of instructional 
stocking-stuffer for curious grand-
children. His casual history lessons 
should be of great use in that 
capacity. 

When asked what his favorite 
hoax was, he points to he Swiss 
Spaghetti Harvest, a broadcast in 
1957 by the British news show 
Panorama that explained rhe details 
of harvesting pasta from spagherti 
trees. Having lived in England for 
seven years, Boese says that the 
"odd, quirky sen e of humor" of 
the British really appeals to 
him. No wonder something as dry 
as the Spaghetti Harvest bea tour 
more sensational stories, such as 
the Hitler Diaries or the War of the 
Worlds as hi s favorite hoax. He also 
cited the Great Moon Hoax and 
the story of Princes Caribou (later 
made into a movie starring Kevin 
Klein) as personal favorites. He 
generally likes the idea of hoaxing 
because it "tweaks pretensions," he 
said. 

Boese was a teachjng assistant 
for Thurgood Marshall College's 
Dimensions of Culture program 
for four years, but has since 
stopped teaching to work on his 
still-unfinished dissertation . He 
claims his work on the book was 
inAuenced by his experience Witll 
D .O .C., specifically the material 
from the 1930s and '60s. He did his 
undergraduate work at Amherst 
College in Ma:;sachuserrs, and 
before tllat, attended high school in 
Washington, D.C. 

His research included conract-
ing some of the people involved 
with the hoaxes, such as profession-
al hoaxer Gorgeous Guy, Joey 
Scaggs and the owner of Snowball 
the Monster Cat, Cordell 
Haughlie. He found inspiration 
during the creation of this book in 
the wisdom of Bruno Latour, who 
once said, "Scientific facts are 
social constructions." This became 
the museum's creed. 

The Museum of Hoaxes is in 
stores November II .

November elections. 
"In short, this has been an expe-

rience that I would not be able to 
get in San Diego," Bedford said. 

Oliver Kaplan, a 2001 political 
science graduate from John Muir 
College, attended the UCDC pro-
gram in fall 1999. He also worked 
as a UCDC program adviser for 
two quarters . While in D .C., 
Kaplan interned at the office of 
cabinet affairs in the White House. 
He worked under the cabinet sec-
retary and the assistant to the pres-
ident, who at that time was 
Thurgood Marshall, .I r. 

"Thurgood Marshall, Jr. was 
definitely an inspiration, as were 
other members of the White 
House staff," Kaplan said. "People 
often bag on government as being 
bloated, bureaucratic, etc. But 
these people were as bright as any-
one around and really cared about 
their work, worked hard for little 
pay and thought they could make a 
difference. " 

Kaplan had a variety of interest-
ing experiences during his intern-
ship. He rode in an elevator with 
Hillary Clinton and attended press 
conferences where the president 
would advocate policies. He also 
assisted wi th research to hel I' man-
age White House responses to 
interest groups at the 1999 wr 
Ministerial in eattle. 

Kaplan is currently an econo-
mist/public policy researcher at the 
San Diego Association of 
Governments. He believes that his 
experiences in the UCDC program 

have helped him in his career. 
"The words 'The White House' 

on my resume are definitely an eye-
catcher and I think it shows employ-
ers that I can get high-level work 
done," Kaplan said. "No matter how 
intimidating my current boss may 
be, he sure isn't the president." 

In terms of classes, students 
meet once a week and are expected 
to complete a research paper in 
order to receive units for their 
internship. The optional research 
seminar is designed to help guide 
students through the writing 
process. 

"The class is much more based 
on participation; the length varies 
with the amount of participation 
that occurs," Lebato said. "The 
class discussions are engaging and 
prove to be intellecwally stimulat-
ing." 

Aside from internships and 
classes, the program also offers 
field trips in the D.C. area. 

"Most classes will take the stu-
dents out for a taste of D.C. by 
relating the subject material to the 
local art museums, monuments, 
and one even relates D .C. politics 
to Shakespeare," Schiff said. 

The UCD program does not 
only attract political science 
majors; wdents from almost every 
other major also apply. Each quar-
ter, a group of students are selected 
from applications . 

"We selected applicants based 
on a few things," Roberts said . 
"Graduating senior get priority, 
then all of the otller senjors and 
then juniors. We al 0 look ar their 
academic achievement, based on 

their GPA." 
Once selected and immersed in 

the program, students generally 
come back with great experiences 
and positive comments . 

"The people you meet here all 
come from such different back-
grounds and upbringings that it 
presents an interesting mixture of 
philosophies and positions. It pre-
sents a fascinating opportunity to 
hea r different viewpoints on vari-
ous issues and have the opportu-
nity to be engaged with people 
who think in a completely differ-
ent manner," Lebato said. 

Schiff confers that the experi-
ence is worthwhile . 

"I couldn't only pick out one 
advantage for going on this trip. 
The UCDC program is one expe-
rience that 1 don't think anyone 
should miss" Schiff said.

nJESDAY. NOVEMBER 12.2002 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Front row: Title IX has its obvious flaws 
conlilll~d from paF,e 20 

from the federal government. 
However, the option is not Title IX 
or nothing. We need to demand 
something bener. 

Great innovation is born out of 
dissatisfaction with an inferior sys-
rem. The horse and buggy served 
its purpose, but had Henry Ford 
not demanded bener, we would not 
have the automobile. Candles give 
off light, but if Thomas Edison had 
thought that was good enough, we 
would not have the light bulb. If 
the Articles of Confederation were 
accepted for their flaws, we would 
not have the Constitution. 

There are obvious flaws in Title 
IX. Even if funding was donated for 
a football team here, the faculty 
miraculously approved, a suitable 
facility was found and every student 
at UCSD cried out in favor of foot-

ball, we could not have a team 
because it would upset the delicate 
balance of proportionality. That 
just seems wrong. 

Title IX seeks gender equality, 
but in dealing with nwnbers, statis-
tics and percentages it misses the 
human nature of the problem. Men 
and women are different. Physically, 
intellectually, emotionally and in 
what interests we hold, the sexes are 
very unique. Hopefully someday 
we'll get to a point where equal work 
will mean equal pay and where our 
leaders will be elected by their qual-
ifications and not by their gender, 
but I hope that we never reach the 
day where men and women are the 
same. The differences are what 
make us unique. 

This society needs equal treat-
ment for men and women in athlet-
ics, but it does not need Title IX. It 

needs something that is more com-
petent in recognizing the individual 
needs of athletes and institutions. It 
needs something that is able to meet 
the goal of increasing athletic partic-
ipation for women without being at 
the expense of men, and it needs sm-
dents to demand that our govern-
ment find a better solution. 

You are unanimously in favor of 
Title IX. You must be. Your repre-
sentatives have JUSt said as 
much. But, if they're wrong and 
this campus' true feelings are not 
being represented, you need to tell 
them so. 

If I'm wrong, and you're happy 
with the system as it is, that's fine 
too. But, if that's the case, I won't 
ever expect to hear a complaint 
about our lack of a football team 
again. The sta tus quo is never 
going to make that happen. 

Volleyball: Team begins to focus on playoffs 
continued from page 20 

Despite UC Davis' poor record, 
the Triton players insist they take 
each contest seriously and use the 
time to gain experience and cohe-
siveness as a unit. 

"We're focusing on every match 
as it occurs," Bonnie Wilson said. 
"We sti ll haven't reached our peak. 
We're using every match to devel-
op our team even further." 

The whirlwind tour of the 
CCAA came to itS final SlOp Nov. 9 
as UC 0 went to play the Chico 
State Wildcats. Before the match, 
Chico State celebrated the careers 
of their seniors, but from the outset 
it was clear that the Tritons would 
be the team celebrating at the end 
of the night. 

Several Tritons had big individ-

ual matches that propelled UCSD to 
a 30-22, 20-24 and 20-27 sweep. 
Ohta distributed 49 assists in the 
three-game contest to increase her 
conference-leading assists per game 
total . Middle blockersJennie Wilson 
and Katie Hogan filled the stat sheet 
as beneficiaries of many of Ohta's 
sets as Hogan notched 14 kills, and 
Wilson added nine while picking up 
10 digs, getting five block assists and 
hitting .57 1 for the match. 

The accomplishments of Hogan 
and Jennie Wilson were noted by 
Ohta as being a key to the UCSD's 
success. 

" Our middles played really 
well," she said. "Once you get the 
middles going it confuses the blocks 
a lor. All the hitters have to work 
together to get each other open." 

Benefiting from some single 
blocks on the outside and the focus 
on the middle, Bonnie Wilson put 
down 17 kills to lead the Tritons. 

Although they earned three-con-
secutive sweeps, the Tritons say that 
they still haven't played the ideal 
match where every player plays her 
best. UCSD insists that it is a team 
that is continuing to elevate its play. 

"One of our main goals is to keep 
getting bener because we want to 
peak during playoffs," Ohta said. 

The Tritons will play two more 
tune-ups before the postseason 
begins as they close their home sea-
son Nov. 15 and Nov. 16 against 
Sonoma State University and San 
Francisco State U niversity. Each 
match begins <I t 7 p.m. <It RIMAC 
Arena.

TEAM PREVIEW 

Women's basketball grows even younger 
F our newcomers will compete for point guard 

By OWEN MAIN 
Staff Writer 

L.lst year the UCSD women's 
hJ ketba ll tea m was yOllng. This 

~'e ar, the Tritons will be even 
~'ou nger with only tl ve upperclass-
men, Incl uding one senior, three 
juniors and one communi ty coll ege 
transfer. Youth ,viII be 1Il0st evident 
Jt the point guar I position, where 
all four pl ayers competing for the 
spot arc new to the program. 

With new players doing most of 
the ball handling, UCSD coach 
J IIdy Malone will install a more up-
tcmpo and frenetic system. 

"Wc're going to try to get the 
ga me up-tempo because we don't 
have the size to pound the ball 
,Igainst some of the bigger California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 

teams~" Malone said. "Hopefully, it 
will take some of the pressure off of 
the new point guards as well ." 

\"-'hile the point guard position 
is still uncertain, senior shooting 
guard I ichole BromJey has been a 
starter for all three years and will 
bring experience and leadership in 
the backcourt as the only senior on 
the squad . 

"It 's always good to have lots of 
good, talented young players," said 
Bromley, who averaged eight pOints 
and tlve rebounds per game last year 
and is a co-captain t1lis eason. "The 
junior class is very strong this year 
too. I have confidence in them." 

Joi ning Bromley on the wing 
will be junior and fellow co-captain 
Ali Ginn. UCSD's leading scorer 
last year, Ginn averaged 14 points 
and four rebounds during her 
sophomore campaign. 

The Tritons will get most of 
their inside play this season from 
sophomore center Margaret 
J uhn~un , the team's leaeling 
rebounder from last seaso n, as well

"Karina reall y played well 
agai nst some of the bigger players 
at US D," lalone said. "Even 
though we lost on the scoreboard, I 

felt like we defimtel y gOt some 
tllings accomplished." 

Junior co-captain Erynnc Faucett 
agreed ,vith the coach's as essment 
of the e,xhibition against ti,e Toreros. 

" It was definitely a test for us ," 
Faucett said. "Karina is very talent-
ed." 

The other Triton post defenders 
also gave coach Malone some 
encouragement. 

"For the most part, we stopped 
their big people inside," the coach 
said. "We did some good things to 
take them out of their offense." 

The exhibition gave the TritOns 
the opportunity to work on some 
things in a gamc situation . 

"USD was a good test," 
Bromley said. "It showed what we 
really need to work on and was a 
learning experience that showed us 
about stuff that you can't practice." 

With a new system, the "Hi tons 
will be joining the trend of change in 
the CCAA conference tllis season. 

"Lots of teams [in the CCAAj 

reloaded with transfers from junior 
colleges or Division 1 schools. The 
conference will definitely be 
tough," Malone said. 

Bromley was cautiously opti-
mistic about the beginning of the 
season. 

"We could have a slow start 
with so many new players and a 
new system," Bromley said. "Bur 
no one is turn.ing away from the 
challenge. Our talent, heart and 
hustle will make the difference and 
we'll get it going." 

UCSD has one more preseason 
scrimmage against a different USD, 
the University of South Dakota, on 
Nov. IS at RIMAC Arena. The reg-
ular season starts ov. 22 and Nov. 
23 when the UCSD will travel to 
Billings, Mont., to face Montana 
State-Billings on back-to-back days. 

"It should be a good opportuni-
ty for our team to bond even 
more," Faucett said. "We're all 
excited about the trip and starting 
the season."

Cross country: Sung and 
Kalra lead respective teams 

continued from page 20 
honor. Sung, who finished second 
£0 Cal Srate Los Angeles' 
Annmarie Houson for the con-
ference title, radically improved 
from her 25th-place finish last 
year, bur could not hold off the 
red shirt freshman phenom, who 
won her third-consecutive meet 
on Nov. 9. 

Following Sung for UCSD 
was Lillian Gardiner (24th), 
Meghan Bellotti (28th), Mimi 
Hodgins (35 th), Erin O'Donnell 
(36th), Lindsay Stalker (51st) and 
Kara Cross (60th). 

Neil Kalra, comi ng off his 
first-ever All -CCAA award, 
added an All-West Region Team 
honor to his resume with a 14th-
place finish (33:29) to lead the 
Tri£On men. The region award, 
much like the CCAA award, is 
given to the top 15 finishers in 
their respective meet. David 
Dunbar just missed becoming the 
second Triton on the all-region 
team with a 16th place finish 
among 118 runners. Following 
Dunbar was Alan Shapiro (22nd), 
John Morrison (24th), Carl 
Lostrom (37th), Tov Fisher-
Kirshner (39th) and Stephen 
Martin (76th). 

The CCAA swept all three 
national championship berths, 
with UC Davis narrowly beating 
out Chico State 86-91 for the 
women's title, a form of revenge 
for the Aggies, who had their 
four-year CCAA championship 

run broken by the "Vildcats two 
weeks ago. UCSD finished third 
out of 20 teams with 126 points 
in its best-ever showing at the 
Division II regional meet. 

The men's results were similar 
to last year's race, with the same 
top-four teams, but this time with 
Chico State handily defeating 
four-timc defending regional 
champion U Davis 43-81'\ for 
the ti tie. 

The University of Alaska-
Anchorage denied UCSD 
another nJtional championship 
berth, finishing third of 16 
teams with 105 points to the 
Tritons' 113 . Last season the 
Tritons, with a fourtll-place Iln-
ish as well, advanced to the 
national meet. But this year, the 
Western Region's fourth berth 
was eliminated, leaving 
Anchorage as the final regional 
representative . 

Heading into the conference 
championships, both teams were 
ranked third in th e region before 
a poor show ing at Cal State 
Bakersfield dropped both to 
sixth in the polls heading into 
the regional meet. By rebound-
ing from the con ference meet, 
the women's team, which fin-
ished 12 th at last year's western 
regional race and did not qualify 
for the national meet, will com-
pete in its first-ever Division II 
National Championship at 
Ashland University in Ohio 011 
Nov. 23 . 

Men's soccer: UCSD loses 
to eventual CCAA champs

improvement over last year's 
record of 6-9-1. Cal State 
Dominguez Hills (18-3-1, 13-1 -
o CCAA) advanced to the CCAA 
finals and defeated Cal State 
Bakersfield by a score of 2 -0 to 
win the conference title. 

Looking ahead to next season, 
all things point to continued 
improvement and success for 
UCSD. The Tritons fielded the 
youngest team in the conference 

this year and still managed to win 
the CCAA South Division tirle . 
Additionally, freshman midlie lder 
Matthew Davey narrowly missed 
being selected as CCAA 
Freshman of the Yellr. Fivt: play-
ers, including NCAA AII -
American Bobby Saadati, will 
graduate following this season, 
but the bulk of the roster will 
return next fall to try and 
improve on this year's perfor-
mance.

Soccer: Tritons withstand 
Aggies' rallies in 2~ 1 win 

continued from page 20 
their act. 

The Trirons fell into a slump as 
their defense was pinned on its end 
by the Aggies' constant shots in 
their attempt ro surge past UCSD. 

An Aggie shot, diverted from 
the arms of Triton goalkeeper 
Kami Poma, tied the game at one 
goal apiece as the (WO teams ended 
the first half. 

either the determined Triton 
defense nor their rapid offense 
were disheartened by tl,e Aggics, 
who had their hands full with the 
traditional quick pace Witll which 
the Tritons played the game. 

Jones catapulted the Tritons to 
vicrory wi th her masterful goal 
only 40 seconds into the second 
hali', when she outran several 
defenders and cut through (WO 
additional defenders before scoring 
the game-winner. 

After the goa l, the game 
declined inro a defensive quagmire, 
as the two £Op-ranked teams nego-
tiated a boggy field laid ro waste by 
the torrent of rai n from the previ-
0us days. 

As if that weren't enough, the 
troublesome Aggies sought to rally 
one last time when Kristin Aja's 
cross from the left tried to find its 
way into the Triron goal. 

This became the climax of the 
game, since the Trirons' superiori-
ty in recovering from seemingly 
overpowering odds was proudly 
showcased. 

UCSD maintained its momen-
tum when it blocked every attempt 

almost at contact. With tl,e full 
depth of the team shining forth, 
they exuded energy in preventing 
the ball from ruining their previous 
chance to clinch the tirle. 

The Tritons finally cleared the 
ball across midfield, effectively 
putting an end to the serious Aggie 
threat that became a lost cause. 

UCSD, focused and mentally 
prepared, capitalized on its chances 
and forced the Aggies to accept 
defeat in a game marred by a horrid 
playing field and pesky rival players. 

The triumph was an overall 
team effort, but particularly strong 
performances were made by 
Shannon Harrelson, Christine 
Wensel and Jackie Shaffer. 

This game followed the Tritons' 
phenomenal 5 - I victory over Cal 
State D ominguez Hills in the semi-
final on Nov. 7 in the heavy rain 
that shadowed UCSD. 

The Tritons' great finish gave 
the (Wo-time defending NCAA 
Division II Champions their third-
straight C AA crown and assured 
UCSD a shot at its fourth-straight 
national championship. 

The Tritons, confident ,vith a 
15 -2 -I season and ranked sixth 
nationally, won the NCAA Division 
ill crown in 1999 and then proceed-
ed to ,vin Division n titles in 2000 
and 2001 as a CCAA member. 

With a degree of optimism, 
UCSD will likely receive a first-
round bye and host the seconcl 
round in the upcoming NCAA 
Division II Championship tourna-
ment.

No. 6 Anteaters drown Tritons 
UCSD cannot comeback from early deficit 

By OWEN MAIN 
Staff Writer 

The 10tll-ranked UCSD men 's 
water polo team went into the 
home contest on ov. 9 against 
sixth-ranked UC Irvine looking for 
an upset win in its final regular sea-
son game. Instead, it ran into a wall 
in the persons of UCl's Drca on 
Barry and Jeff Powers. Barry and 
Powers combined for tune goals in 
the game as the Anteaters dominat-
ed tl,e Tritons and won tl,e game 
easily at 12-7. 

"Our game plan was to wear 
them alit," said Triton sophomore 
utiliry player Clark Peterson. 
"They arc a lot bigger and 
stronger then us as a team, hut we 
knew that if we kept swimming, 
we could wear them out." 

UCI seemed well-prepared for 
the Tritons' game plan from the 

beginning. UCSD's defense 
allowed goals on each ofUCI 's first 
two possessions from players other 
than Barry and Powers to lead tl,e 
Anteaters to an early 2-0 advantage. 

""Ve knew they had two good 
players in Barry and Powers," said 
UCSD sophomore driver Brandon 
Borsa. "We were going to try to 
make other people beat us. Once 
they did, it rook us out of our plan." 

But the Tritons showed some 
life of their own and rallied with 
two consecutive goals to even the 
III 3 tch in the fi rst peri od . 

With tl,e game tied at twO 
goal s apiece, UCI buckled its 
defense down while its offense 
began ro run on all cylinders. 
Using its characteristic physica l 
play, UCI rallied five unanswered 
goals to take a 7 -2 halftime lead . 

"They like to slow the game 
down and dominate you in a Set 

offense," Pe ter~()n said . "\ \ '<: thd -

Tritons clinch third-straight conference title

Runners

By MICHAEL SCHOECK 
Staff Writer 

Excitement and anticipation per-
meated the soggy atmosphere at 
Rohnert Park's Seawolf Field as the 
first-ranked Tritons crushed their bit-
ter rivals, third-ranked UC Davis, in 
the title match of the 2002 California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
Women's Soccer Championship on 

ov.9. 
With this grueling but monumen-

tal win, UCSD improves to 15 -2 - I as 
well as securing its third-consecutive 
CCAA crown. The Tritons are almost 
guaranteed a chance at a fourth -
stra ight national championship when 
pairings are announced. With the 
defeat, UC Davis is placed at I 1-6-2 
overall.

minute on a header off a lob pass 
from mid fielder Lauren Jacobs. 

Jones out-leapt a desperate Aggie 
defender deep in the penalty box and 
placed the ball out of the reach of UC 
Davis goalkeeper Christine Ogden 
and inside the right goalpost. 

T he game was a tortuous, tit-for-
tat victory - a surges-and-plunges 
game that UCS D mastered with its 
strength, discipline and courage. 

Despite overwhelming the Tritons 
with a high ratio of shots, Davis 
floundered with its overly aggressive 
playing, which had them out-foul the 
Tritons at almost a 2-to- 1 ratio.

From the 
Front Row 

Bryce Warwick 

Your A.S. Council just passed a resolution supporting the greatest obstacle to UCSD 
ever having a footba ll team. Did 
you notice' 

The council passed a resolution 
supporting Title [)( - a 1972 gen-
der equality act - without discus-
sion, by consensus. It is this statute 
that requires schools to conform to 
a standard cal led proportionality in 
order to be found compliant. 

The proportionali ty clause, as 
enforced by the Office of Civil 
Rights, says that a school's student-
athlete population must be propor-
tional to the composition of the 
student body as a whole, and 
pending is expected to follow. 

So how do schools deal with this 
restriction' They cut men's sports. 
Collegiate wrestling is an endan-
gered species, men's tennis teams 
are becoming more rare and each 
year a few more football programs 
are discontinued. 

Title IX was intended to increase 
participation in women's sports, and 
it did. It did not intend to do that at 
the expense of men's sports. But it 
did. That's where I have a problem. 

It's nearly impossible for a male 
to pre ent an argument aga inst 
Title IX without sounding sexist, 
but that's what I'm trying to do. I 
love women's sports. In the past 
two months, rve attended 15 
women' games here at UCSD. I 
am passionate about seei ng 
women's teams here at UCSD, and 
beyond that, I think the life lessons 
that sports teach are worth learning 
for both boys and girls. 

I'll concede that Title IX has 
brought about progress in our soci-
ety, and I'm not so naive as to think 
that women's sports would survive 
and prosper without some help

Volleyball's streak reaches four games 
Triton women peaking before playoffs 

By BRYCE WARWICK 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's volleyball team extended its 
winning streak to four games after winning three 
matches against Grand Canyon University, UC Davis 
and Chico State. The Tritons are 23-4 overall and 17-
3 in the California Collegiate Athletic Association. 

After an uninspired performance the previous 
weekend against conference leader Cal State San 
Bernardino, the Tritons came out swinging against 
Grand Canyon on Nov. 6. Sophomore outsider hit-
ters Bonnie Wilson and Stacy Dunsmore led the 
way with 14 and 12 kills, respectively. Dunsmore 
also talli ed 10 digs while UCS D out-dug the 
Antelope.; 52-38 en route to a three-game sweep 
(30-26, 30-22, 30-24). 

" I think that after [playing CSUSBl, we talked 
about playing with more emotion and more passion, 

and I think we did that," said sophomore setter 
Teresa Ohta. 

After playing on that night, flying back and 
going to classes on the following day, the Tritons hit 
the road again on the morning of Nov. 8, flying 
north to take on UC Davis. 

UCSD opened slowly, allowing UC Davis to 
jump out to an 11-8 lead before senior Jennie 
Wilson served up nine straight points to put the 
Tritons in front as they held off an Aggie push to 
take the 30-25 victory. 

UCSD opened game two with a 10-0 run, and 
attacked with an outstanding .414 for the game to 
win easily 30-14. The Tritons didn't let up in the 
third game, again attacking above .400 as Je.nnie 
Wilson put down nine of her 12 kills for the match 
in the 30-20 win. 

See VOLLEYBALL. Page '5 

By placing among the top three 
teams, the women's team will 
advance to the NCAA Division II 
National Championships, while 
the men's team narrowly missed a 
second-consecutive trip to nation-
als. 

The meet, which was hosted by 
Cal State Stanislaus, was composed 
of teams from the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association, the 
Great Northwest Athletic 
Conference and the Pacific West 
Conference, and is one of the eight 
regional meets that together will 
compromise the national champi-
onship. 

On the women's side, the 
Tritons' Audrey Sung continued 
her stellar season with a third-place 
finish among 131 runners with a 
time of 22 :07 in the 6K race, good 
for her first All-West Region Team

Men's soccer falls short in CCAA tournament 
Tritons lose a hard-fought match to No.6 CSUDH, 1-0 

By MARK STICKEL 
Staff Writer 

Despite playing one of its best 
matches of the season, the UCSD 
men's soccer team lost to Cal State 
Dominguez Hills in the semifinals 
of the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association tournament. 

The tournament was hosted by 
Sonoma State University. The 
game, originally scheduled to be 
played at sSU's Seawolf Field, was 
moved to a nearby field in 
Peta luma, Calif., due to heavy 
rains that had rendered the SSU 
field unusable. 

T he Toros scored the only goal 
of the game just eight minutes into 
play on a point-blank shot by 
CSUDH's Rick Cobb that barely 
made its way past UCSD keeper 
Jeremy Cookson. The Tritons 
played strong the rest of the first 
half, but found themselves down 
by one goal at halftime. 

In the second half, UCSD 
stepped up and came out strong, 
but despite having several chances, 
could not get past the stingy 
CSUDH defense. 

"They have a hell of a defense," 
said Triton head coach Derek 
Armstrong. "They only let in six 

goals all season ." 
From about the 65th minute, 

the Tritons stepped up the offen-
sive pressure even more and 
missed several close chances. 

"They were just hanging in for 
the last 20 to 30 minutes of the 
game," Armstrong said. "I think if 
we had another minute or twO, we 
would have had an equalizer, and 
then we would have gone on to 
win." 

Because the match was played 
at a park in Petaluma, there was no 
scoreboard displaying the time. 
Additionally, the playing surface 
was Astroturf. 

"I think the turf affected us 
more than them," Armstrong said. 

Until this match, UCSD had 
not played a match on an artificial 
surface this season. 

Despite the loss, Armstrong is 
pleased with the match. 

"It's a very, very positive finish 
for the season," Armstrong said. 
"I'm pleased_ We actuaJly did very 
well." 

The Tritons finish the season 
with an 11 -6 record overall and a 
9-5 record in CCAA matches. 
The finish is a considerable
