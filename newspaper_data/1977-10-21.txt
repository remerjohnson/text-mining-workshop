Paramedic service debate: Prop C 
by Mark Stadler 

Both opponents and proponents of Prop C, the 
proposal for a city~rated paramedics program, 
seem to agree that a paramedics program is one 
service the city should provide. 

Where they disagree is on the size of the program 
and the extent to which the dty should be involved in 
its maintenance. 

San Diegans, during the Nov. 8 general election, 
will decjde which argument they prefer. Two years 
ago, voters rejected a similar measure by a two-to-
one margin. 

While the final vote on Prop C will only be advisory 
- just '8S was the vote on nude bathing in September-
the City Council is expected to heed the voters' advice 
on the issue. 

One Plan 
One plan now being studied, which was drawn up by 

the City Manager's staff, would have the city start a 
force of 31 paramedics by next fall. The force would 
gradually be increased in size, until it numbered 131 
paramedics in 1983. 

According to langUage in the ballot proposal, a city-
operated paramedic service would cost about $3.4 
million annually by 1983. A difference between this 
year's proposal and that offered in 1975 is that fun-
ding does not necessarily have to come from an in-
crease in property taxes. 

Supporters of Prop C think one major reason the 
1975 proposal failed was because it would have 
mandated a 15 cent hike in the property tax rate to 
fund the program. They estimate Prop C would cost 
the average homeowners $3 or $4 more in property 
taxes each year. 

Another reason, according to John de Castro, 
cochair of People for Paramedics, is that San 
Diegans are now more familiar with the value of a 
paramedics service. 

" People have seen the value of paramedics in the 
past two years," deCastro said. "In 1975 the concept 

was new to San Diego." 
City Councilman Lee Hubbard, who co-authored 

the ballot argument favoring Prop C, feels a 
paramedics program is a vital service the city should 
provide, along with such services as police, fire-
fighting and garbage collecting, according to his aide 
Frank Exhar06. 

Prop C supporters believe a paramedics program 
could save 500 to 700 lives each year in San Diego, 
since paramedics are better trained than city police 
and firefighters in emergency medical situations. 

"Not Hard-hearted" 
Opponents of Prop C disagree with the figures 

advanced by paramedic supporters. "We're not a 
hard-hearted group of people. We just don't believe 
accurate figures on the cost of this program are 
available," said Tony Waller, executive director of 
the Association of Concerned Taxpayers. 

Waller, who co-authored the ballot argument 
against Prop C, said there are probably other city-
funded programs that provide less service than a 
paramedics program would provide. He advanced 
the idea that the City Council might drop such 
programs to provide funding for a paramedics plan 

. without raising property taxes. 
"But I don't think that will happen. It's politically 

unpopular to end any programs, " he said. 
Waller said he has figures which show annual 

property taxes will increase $25 on the average, to 
support the paramedics program now being con-
sidered. 

Waller's group supports an experiment, under 
which a local private ambulance company would 
provide two paramedic units to the city free of charge 
for one year. 

At the end of that year, Waller said, the City 
Council could evaluate the results and decide whether 
the city really needs a full-scale paramedics 
program. 

itself merits a work of art, with off-
beat promo posters adorning the 
acoustic tile walls and a faint in-
cense burning from a human-head 
candle in the corner. To my right, 
Alice Cooper stared at me from the 
wall, with caption "Family 
planning means never having to 
say you're sorry." I moved on to 
the next poster. 

Gebron took a break and we 
discussed the "anti-commercial" 
theme of the station. "It would be 
almost a statement of conscience 
for the execs to admit that 
F1eetwood Mac is a good group," 
he commented. Gerbron added 
that the station as a whole has a 
natural distaste for songs which 
are popularly played on other San 
Diego stations. 

General Manager Gary 
Weimberg, who hyper-actively 
struts around the station, 
frequently seeking out a cigarette 
Qr two, explains that "listening to 
San Diego stations is like listening 
to baby farts ... or, better yet, 
nothing." 

Need to exist 
Weimberg sees the need for 

KSDT to exist as a response to 
"we're mellow and we're hip -
KGB, or we're hype and we're hip -
KCBQ. There's nothing in bet-
ween." 

Keeping his hands occupied, 
Weimberg sorted through the mail 
and came across a pile of resumes 
that had been sent to the station. 
He glanced at a few and stopped. 
"Ah-ha! A former CIA employee. " 
An amused grin grew on his face. A 
sinister grin. 

Weimberg, continuing, said that 
the top-40 stations are run by 
executives whose "main interest is 
oiling the way for the recording 
industry." He views those stations 
as so repetitious that their entire 
selections may be heard in one 
hour. 

aspect of the music world. 
Frank and Weimberg over-

whelmed me with one fact : "The 
record business is a larger in-
dustry, in tenns of dollars, than 
television and radio ' combined. " 
Weimberg added that " If anybody 
calls rock revolutionary, you can 
tell them they're wrong." 

EarWax 
Describing KSDT programming, 

Frank called the style "avant-
garde progressive jazz-rock 
fusion ." He spoke of the "Ear-
Wax" show at 7 every evening, 
when a new album is played each 
day. "Our emphasis is on new 
music," said Frank. 

As Weimberg explained " the 
raw-naked truth" of KSDT 's 
limited broadcasting area (Revelle 
cafeteria and cable radio in La 
Jolla and Pacific Beach), $1 ,000 
worth of broadcasting equipment, 
designated for the Muir campus, 
was delivered. Weimberg, whose 
energy never appears to cease, 
hopped over to the boxes and 
embraced the costly transmittor. 

The reason for his excitement? 
He sees this as a major ad-
vancement in restoring and 
stablizing the radio station after 
the "corrupt administration" of 
former Stab on Manager Eden 
Martinez, which cost KSDT the 
loss of its funding two years ago. 
" Last year our main job was to 
stop the station from folding 

. completely," said W_berg. 
Role of AS 

When asked about the role of the 
AS at KSDT, Weimberg said free 
broadcasting time, as with any 
other non-profit organization, 
would be allotted to the student 
goverrunent. 

He was concerned for the 
autonomy of the station, however. 
" We have to have an image of 
offering a valid alternative. The AS 
doesn't have the style to run a 
radio station," Weimberg 
reflected. 

"If anybody calls 
reek revolutionary, you can 
tell them they're wrong." 

Both Weimberg and Music 
Director Rich Frank revealed their 
disgust with the presef!t state of the 
music industry. "The music 
business is 25 percent music and 75 
percent business," said Frank. He 
spoke of frequent attempts by 
recording companies to 
manipulate him into playing their 
records. "I never promise them 
anything. I use my own judgement 
about what's going to be played," 
he stated. 

"Look at this," Weimberg said in 
disbelief, "an AI Stewart 'Year of 
the Cat' calendar." He shook his 
head over the cost and energy that 
is directed into the commercial 

He addressed the AS president 
directly . " Jeff Leifer wants to be a 
leader who's loved, and a leader 
with that in mind can never be part 
of a radio station." 

(I don't think I've ever in-
terviewed a more quotable person 
than Gary Weimberg) . 

Why is Weimberg at KSt>T? " I 
came here most of all because 
radio is fun, radio is great." Three 
other persons in the room agreed 
immediately. I heard one call it "a 
trip." 

Well, it certainly isn't Kansas. 
KSDT is ... somewhere over the 
rainbow.

Commentary 
Day Care Center faces financial crisis' 

by Barry Hymu . 
CommJuloaerol8aade.t 

WelllIft, UCSD 

On a nice Spring day (Sprin8 
quarter 1976) the State 
Firemanbal's office ruled that the 

U~ Day Care Center, which the 
Campus Enviromnental Health 
and Safety (EHIrS) department 
certified safe for 40 children, can 
care for only 29 occupants at any 
onetime. 

In an open letter following the 
Firemarshal 's order , parents 
voiced concern about the need to 
provide OIild Care for these 
"extra" children. This was neVer 
answered. However, the Chan-
cenor did take action. He accused 
Student Affairs of mismanagement 
and made Day Care accountable to 
the Business Office. This decision 
was natural enough for the head of 
a corporate enterprise such as 
UCSD: blame the middle 
bureaucracy and hope they handle 
the situation more tactfully. 

However, the problem o( Day 
Care was not answered. <llancellor 
McElroy made no conunitment for 
Day care at UCSD. The Day Care 
Center remained in a continuing 
state of crises. He also created a 
committee within the Day Care 
Center which made over-all policy-
making not on the part of students 

but on the part of a select ~ of 
people appoAnted campl8-Wide. 
Thus the coUective effort of 
parents "as minimized If not 
ne~rallzed. 

The name of this committee W8I 
the Day Care Center AdvIsory 
Commiu.,. By some Duke, many 
benevolent people were on it. 
Almost all members were parents 
who had chlldren already in the 
Day Care Center. At the opening of 
thia school year a ne" space 
(facility) was allocatedfortbe Day 
Care Center by effort from Josie 
Foulks, Director of the Day Care 
Center. Counting the square inches 
of the floor space 011 the outside 
and the inside of the two facilities 
(the old one and the new one) they 
found that the Center could support 
only 32 children at anyone time 
IUlder state law. This was a far cry 
from what parents at UCSD 
wanted; but the Chancellor was 
finn. The Day Care Advisory 
Committee theA worked within the 
parameters set by the University 
and the manpower constraiJU of 
the Business Office. 

In other words the coounittee 
was working within a system 
where Day Care was not a priority. 
The paperwork involved nmning a 
Day Care Center was given to the 
Business Office which had neither 

tbe Ume nor the manpower to deal 
with it effectively. 

Bareb .... et 
The cOlDlDiUee tried bird to 

produce a budget. Tbe projected 
espellleS for Day care for Im-78 
W8I • .-. nu. budget wu a 
bu'e minimum; there was 1M) fat. 
The Day Care Advlaory CommIUee 
could cm no more without cutting 
the quality of the program of Day 
Care. The Day Care Advisory 
Committee then went ahead and 
bled the parents of $34,866 which 
traMlates into $150 per mo.h for a 
child enrolled full time. SDE (State 
Department of Education) gave 
~,ooo. United Way gave $11,000. 
Nevertheless , the Day Care 
Advisory Conunittee carne up 
$31 ,000 short for the year 's l'UMing 
of Day care. 

Through all this time there still 
was not commitment for Day Care 
by the University. On hearing the 
projected deficit. parents went to 
the Registration Fee CommiUee 
(or money. The parents had 
already come up with it on their 
own and through the efforts of the 
Day Care Advisory Conunittee 
generated over 70% of the money 
needed to operate the Day Care on 
UCSD. The Registration Fee 
Committee commeneed to have a 
series of votes on whether they 

should fWld Day Care at all. 
After weeks of concerned people 

pleading with the Reg. Fee, wtlicb 
has an estimated ,.'U million pool 
of fundi, they came up with a 
minimal fIl,OIIO. U.C. Riverside'. 
Reg. Fee gave five times that 
8OMn.t for 1m-'ll. The parents 
IDd Day care Center AdviIory 
Qmmittee sent Laura MIchetti to 
see Chancellor McElroy for help. 
He provided ",OlIO out of his 
discretionary funds. Thus, Day 
Care for uom weathered througb 
yet another crisis. 

However. tbe Chancellor 
retaliated. He wanted alternatives 
to the present Day Care situstion 
and a different prioritizing of 
funding. He ordered that the 
United Way money should not be 
used for Day Care. He also refused 
to shell out more money from his 
discretionary fund. Reg. Fee 
followed right along, thus, creating 
a projected defic,t of $40,000. Many 
people call this a financial crisis of 
what really should be tenned as a 
"withdrawal of University funck" 
for Day Care. Since there was no 
established commitment fnm 
<lIancellor and Reg. Fee's course 
of action was apparent. 

Parents .. , 
The parents still came up with 

over 70 percent of the money 
needed for operation of Day Care 
at uom. but Chancellor McElroy 
and Reg. Fee was not listening. 
Thus, a projected f40,ooo deficit for 
operation of the Day Care Center 
1971-79 was created. 

Over the summertime two 
committees were set up. The first 
was the Day Care steering Com-
mittee which is to find "alter-
native" means to bancDe the 
present "financial criaia." This 
committee has no parent or 
lItudem represerUtiOll on the 
Committee. Maryann Haebner, the 
ClI8ncellor's secretary cbairs this 
committee. 

It was bel' feeJJog that student 
and parent repreaentation on this 
committee would oaly binder

minlstndon and the committee.

Minority doctors 
serve communitY 
as "role models" 

The medical schools of this country have an 
obligation to provide doctors for those who 
need them. 

Affirmative action programs provide an 
effective means of allowing minorities who 
have met a minimum entrance requirement 
to enter medical schools and eventually 
return to their underprivileged cOmmunities. 
These doctors would have a distinct ad-
vantage in treating minority patients because 
they would have first-hand psychological 
insight into the apprehensions and problems 
that minorities face. 

Friday. October ZI, 1177 

More Significantly, minority doctors would 
provide the role models which are vital if 
followmg generations are to rise above the 
career limitations imposed by the boWldaries 

.of their own environment. A minority child 
who grows up in a community where 
professional adults are scarce carmot be 
expected to aspire to a career with which he 
or she is Wlfamiliar. 

Does an affirmative action program, such 
as that of UC Davis medical school which is 
currently being challenged by applicant Allan 
Bakke, produce an inferior grade of 
professional? It may be argued that the 
minority students have been admitted 
without the superior academic record of other 
applicants and are therefore unable to 
become adequately prepared ' for their 
careers. 

liThe Bakke decision, now in the 
hands of the US Supreme Cour~ is' 
perhaps the most important civil 
rights case of this decade." The 
Triton Times invites reader input as 
the editorial board explores the 

. pros and conS-of this controversial 
issue." 

However, it should be obvious that. once 
admitted, minority students are on equal 
grllunds in terms of survival as the other 
students. Logically speaking, only those 
students who have attained a minimum grade 

of achievemnet at the professional school level are those who 
will become practicing professionals. Thus, the quality of 
doctors, as well as of other responsible career persons, is 
assured. 

Yes, opinion on the affirmative action issue is emotionally 
bas~. ~ut from an objective position, these programs ef-
fectively mtegrate the long-<leprived minority into responsible 
positions in the professional world. 

ffirmative action unclear 

Quotas reverse discrimination? . 
It's like trying to collar 

something in a vicious circle 
without knowing what you might 
find at the end of the leash once you 
do succeed. Affirmative Action : Is 
it really as clear cut as it seems? 

It's based on a sound principle. 
Those who have had a disad-
vantaged background will 
necessarily find it more difficult to 
enter into a university than 

someone who was brought up in a 
wealthy envirorunent. One of the 
best ways of eliminating the factor 
of variation in economic 
backgrounds is to let those who are 
disadvantaged enter a university, 
even if academically they fall 
below others. After completing 
their education, allow them to 
serve as models and to help reduce 
the disadvantages inherently 
experienced by the poor or

minority members. 
Perhaps this is what UC Davis 

officers had in mind when they 
refused to admit Allan Bakke into 
their medical school since a cer-
tain number of admittances had 
already been reserved for minority 
applicants. (A quota, if you will. ) 
In this way the UC system hopes to 
improve our country and its 
citizens. 

But this program ignores some 
pertinentfacts: 

Not all minority applicants have 
come from a disadvantaged 
background, and there are those 
who are poor and are not members 
of a minority. 

But even setting aside these two 
details, we must ask ourselves 
whether we will be accomplishing 
what we set out to do: will those 
who are admitted WIder the 
Affirmative Action program and 
only because of Affirmative Action 
do well enough in school so that 
they can return to their com-
munities as models? Maybe not. 
Recall, for a moment, that those 
who are admitted ultimately on the 
basis of their race are 
academically the lowest ranked 
members of their class at the onset . 

Finally, admission on the basis 
of quotas is discrimination. And 
discrimination is wrong even if it is 
in reverse. 

Something needs to be done 
about the disadvantaged in this 
country. If we tota lly accept the 
concept of equality at this point in 
time a nd suffice in be ing non-
discriminatory we shall find that 
within a forseeable future those 
who have been disadvantaged and 
discriminated against in the past 
will filter into the mainstream. 

At this same time we won't find 
ourselves creating as much fric-
tion as we would through the quota 
system in order to achieve a 
particular goal. 

Yes, it will be a much slower 
process of equilibration than if we 
artificially grafted the disad-
vantaged into the Wliversities, but 
we might find that natural limbs 
hol'l firmer, and won't be rejected 
by the tree.

UCSD loses second consecutive bid for SCIAC spot 
by Steve Goald 
Sport. EdItor 

The Triton TImes has learned 
that the Intercollegiate Athletics 
Office at UC San Diego has been 
denied admission to the Southern 
California Intercollegiate Athletic 
Conference (the SCIAC) for the 
second consecutive year. 

According to an interview with 
Athletic Director Judy Sweet, the 
attempted move to the SCIAC was 
made in an effort for UCSD to drop 
out of their current intercollegiate 
sports league, the NAJA District 
Three Southern Division. 

Leavlac Diltrid'1'hree 
Sweet, along with Varsity 

basketball coach Barry Cun-
ningham, said their rationale in 
leaving the District Three 
Southern Division was due to 
"UQ)D no longer being able to 
compete with the schools in our 
conference." The six team con-
ference includes USIU, California 
Baptist College, Point Lorna, 
Azuza Pacific, and Southern 
California College, all of which 
have the bulk of their athletes on 
full scholarships. UCSD offers no 
athletic scholarships. 

TbeSCIAC 
"Membership in the SCIAC 

would be the Ideal situation," 
stated Sweet. Currently composed 
of Occidential, Claremont-Mudd 
Men's College, Redlands, Caltech, 
Pomona-Pitzer, LaVerne and 
Whittier, the SCIAC is exactly 
what UQ)D was looking for: a 
group o( schools with high 
academic requirements and no 
athletic scholarships. Aid to these 
schools is given solely on the basis 
of financial need rather than sports 
talent. 

The Board of Directors of the 
SCIAC, headed by Biff Greene, 
laVerne's admissioo officer, cited 
three main reasons for denying 
dmlssloo to UCSD; lack of sup-

port, distance and size. 
Officials of the SClAC coitend 

that UCSD does not haft the 
"college support for intercoUeliate 
athletics." Bee .... of the lack of 
administraUve ' support and the 
fact that UCSD '. football proer-n 
folded lifter' aae 'ear, lis of the 
seven re ..... of the SCIAC voted 
againlt Inviting UCSD Into their 
conference. 

Sweet uys thiI Is confusing 
becaUle the Triton footb.n 
program W8I Initiated In the 
SChool's flnt year of operatioo In 

1965. The program was discon-
tinued due to lack of support and 
fWlds . "How can they draw a 
conclusion by that?" Sweet asked. 
Sle added that many universities 
have dropped football due to rising 
costs; justifying lack of support on 
UQ)D's one-time football teltm is a 
bad example. 

Secondly, the SCIAC poirted to 
the distance between the schools. 
"The traveling distance is ex-
tensive for all of our schools," says 
theSCIAC. 

However, Sweet noted ' 'the 
traveling burden is more on us 
than on them." All the SCIAC 
schools are within thirty miles of 
each other while UCSD is over ooe 
hundred miles from the nearest 
SClAC member. The reason seems 
contradictory because ''the SClAC 
schools already do travel down 
here," as Sweet pointed out, " to 
Point Lorna, University of San 
Diego and us." 

Finally, the SCIAC says the total 
enrollment of UCSD is too big. 
Currently , UCSD has an un-
dergraduate enrolbnent of 7,800 
while the largest SCIAC school has 
2,000. The opportunity and 
availability of walk~ (non-
recruited but still high quality 
athletes) is greater at UQ)D, in-
sists SCIAC regents. 

The conference would be ideal 
for women's as well as men's 
sports. Currently, the SCIAC slates 
league games in all sports for men 
and women. Despite the vote of no 
confidence from the regem for the 
second time, Sweet insists she will 
ask for a hearing with the regents 
of the SCIAC and will most likely 
apply for admission again next 
year. 

AlteraaUves 
Before denial of admiIsIon was 

announced by the SCIAC, Cun-
ningham had developed several 
alternative courses of action for 
the UCSD intercoUeglate program. 

The poasi~ty of a new league, 
one In which "all schools have 
generally tile same academic 
requirementa and athletic 
programs u doe. DCSD" was and 
still la IIrGaIIY eonsIdered by 
Cwmlngbam, wbo b .. 
spearheaded effort. of tbe U Jolla 
bued DC campus droppUIs out of 
the NAIA entirely. The new league 
would allow ~, Cun-
ningham .. ted, but they would be 
awarded on the same luls 81 
thole In the SCIAC. He added ''the 

most important thing, though, is to 
get in a league with the same 
academic requirements." 

However, there are no univer-
sities or colleges in the San Diego 
area which fit into these 
categories. Forming a league with 
the standards preferred and 
requested by Cwtningham and 
Sweet would mean competing 
against schools in the Los Angeles 
area. This would necessitate a 
greater budget to cover the 
traveling expenses for league play 
by all teams, men's and women's. 
Siphoning more funds into the 
athletic program has continually 
been discouraged by the ad-
ministration of UQ)D. 

All-Cal League 
Another alternative but highly 

doubtful solutioo is the formation 
of an All-Calleague, comprised of 
UQ)D, UC Irvine, UC Davis and 
UCRiverside. 

Again, the Triton squads would 

nm into some major problems : 
lack of funds for traveling and 
absence of well-founded programs 
in the respective sports. 

UC Irvine has top level teams in 
track, tennis, baseball , cross 
COWltry and waterpolo, and a 
$20,000 increase in their basketball 
budget. UC Riverside has an NCAA 
Division n basketball team, an 
excellent football team and 
membership in the CCAA, another 
Southern California conference. 
UC Davis has a lock on dominance 
in the Far West Conference in all 
sports. Why then, would these 
schools. want . to compete with 
uQ)m 

Iadepeodence 
If none of these options 

materialize, uam will become an 
NCAA Division III independent, 
possibly by the conclusion of the 
1978-79 academic year. This will 
require a larger budget for 
athletics enabling the school to 

progress to what Cunningham has 
set as his goal: to attain the level of 
UCDavis ' sports program. 

Cunningham, who is finishing his 
doctoral thesis on the far west 
Conference, strongly advocates 
the UC Davis plan. But modeling 
the intercol\egaite athletic 
program after Davis ' would entail 
eliminating many so-called 
marginal teams, reducing the 
n~ber of men's teams to eight or 
rune and women's to five or six. 
This would redistribute funds for 
the existing teams, and possibly 
substantiate administrative claims 
that more money is not needed for 
athletics. 

Another problem is becoming 
independent would be in 
scheduling games. Events would 
have to be planned around other 
schools' schedules, schools which 
already belong to other con-
ferences .

Bill Morgan Named Men's' Swim 
Coach, Looks For Good Season 

The college swimming season 
doesn't begin unW mid-January, 
but already newly hired UC San 
Diego men's swim coach Bill 
Morgan is looking ahead to the 
NAJA Natiooal Championships In 
March. 

Despite the high emphasis 
placed on academics and low 
priority put on athletics, Morgan 
said that it is possible to raise the 
current statllJ of the program to a 
higher level and still maintain the 
academic standards of UQ)D, as 
exemplified by the Ivy League 
schools. But, raising the current 
status of the men's swim program 
at UCSD will be no easy task. 

......r.r1J7l 
Workinc basically from scratch, 

Morgan foWld records In shambles 
and l'OIten from put seaons 
almost I mpouible to find. 
However, within a few days, the 
energetic Morgan bad assembled a 
roster, meticulously planned 
workouts and formed coacblng 
phiIoeophies he will ImplerneM. 

FraIl out of San Diego Slate, 
Mcqu pIarw 00 provlclng a 
program that will lII!nd u many 
people to the NAJA championships 
81 poaaIble . Thia will, he pointed 

out, be accomplished by 8 lot of 
hard work. " We've got the 
potential here. They just have to be 
motivated. Swimming is a mental 
sport and if they work and put in 
the time, they'll make it (to the 
NAIA Natiooals) ." 

Morgan has compiled a list of at 
least twenty quality swimmers, 
but he added he would recruit good 

New .wlm team coach Bill 
Morgan 
swimmers 01\ carJ1WS who don't 
expreII desire to go out. 

NeGnMlNem .... 
Even though it appears Morgan 

has got the swim program on the 
right track and moving In the right 
direction, Morgan was quick to add 
''there will be no Illusions of 
grandeur. I'll be there to do it If 
they (the swinuners) want It 

(invitations to the NAIA's)." 
"We've obviously got budget 

limitations here but we can im-
prove without more funds," 
Morgan observed. The changes for 
the better can be made without 
money, he continued, implying it's 
the coaching that makes the team, 
not necessarily the budget. " At the 
first workout, we'll set team goals 
and decide from there." 

Record Setter 
At SDSU, Morgan captained the 

Aztec team !rom 1974 to 1976, 
setting numerous school records in 
distance freestyle events, picking 
up where he left off at Ygnia High 
School in Concord, California. For 
the past severa yea"" Morgan-has 
coached age group teams in El 
Cajon at ttle Hart Swim 
Association, working with 12 to 19 
year old boys. 

"I enjuji 1.'U4ClaW8 uJut:C veuplt:. 
'lbey are much more motivated," 
Morgan noted about his ex-
periences with the Hartland group. 
At UC5D, he has the students with 
the right mental attitudes. He bu 
the motivation. Only by the middle 
of March will we know If It has all 
jelled together.

UCSO troWlced host Point Lorna College 5-1 Tuesday afternoon in an 
NAIA District Three Southern Division soccer match. The five goals by 
the Tritons were a season high and almost equaled the team's offensive 
output in its first six games combined. 

DomlDate Play 
UC San Diego thoroughly dominated play for the entire ninety minutes 

and for the first time this season, coach Stewart Hayes' plan of attack 
worked .. . and worked ... and worked. 

Doug YOWlgdaie tallied twice and added three assists, running his'team 
leading point total to ten (one point for a goal and one for an assist ). 
OWlcan Campbell also scored twice in the runaway win while Brad 
carruthers scored once. 

Two of UCSO's goals were scored off throw-ins, a technique used by 
Hayes taken from Brazil's 1974 World Cup Olampionship team. 

The final 5 to 1 margin would have been more lopsided if the Tritons had 
been able to capitalize on several other scoring opportimities. 

Rougb Play AgalD 
Hayes said Point Loma would have made the final score much closer if 

their aggressive, almost rough-house style of play could ha¥e been 
directed towards producing goals, not injuries. 

Dave Young dale will miss mIlCh of the rest of the season due to an ankle 
injury sustained during the second half. Goalie Tim Morphy was kicked 
in the ribs on a Point Lorna goal, negating the score by the Crusaders. 

Playoffs 
Despite the overall record of U, UCSD can e.nsure an NAJA playoff 

spot if they can defeat USIU next Monday or Sou\hern california College 
next Wednesday. Now 2-0 in lesgue play, the abbreviated four game 
league schedule Hayes complained about before the season may put his 
team into post season competition.

[CoatiDued from .. ,e 5] 

Outcome 
Gaining admission In another 

conference would eliminate the 
squabble among students that 
UCSO's teams perform poorly (the 
District Three Southern Division 
offers competition above the level 

at which UCSO should be com-
peting, resulting In the sub par 
records) . The intercollegiate 
athletic office, then, will continue 
to plan and search in an effort to 
find a league with which it can 
compete evenly.

the women and steaJlng the bones! 
The A .S. Is (fill-In the blank)! 'lbe 
charges go on and·on. Every week 
new and less substantiated charges 
seem to hit the press. 

First, we were ' 'taking over" the 
Student Center. Some members of 
the College Councils accused us of 
being totally unresponsive and 
Wlheedful of the colleges-even 
though over the past two years of 
college "control" the Student 
Center Board has been groasly 
ineffective, and even tbougb, in the 
Comprehensive Referendum held 
during Wimer '77 the students of 
uam (i.e. Revelle, Mulr, Third, 
and Fourth) voted over-
whelmingly to place the Student 
Center under the control of the 
"central student government!" 

Next, we were accused of foot 
dragging, and told that we really 
should get our aM together. What 
happened to giving a new gover-
nment a grace period? This year Ia 
just four weeks old. Are we sup-
posed to have the programs ~nd 
services of A.S. Berkeley, which 
has been around for 50 years? 
How?! We camot change the world 
in four weeks, and if we tried, I'd 
be very suspicious of the product. 
The members of the A.S, who are 
working the 12 hour days, 6 days 
per week can tell you it's damn 
hard to get moving. We don't want 
just any product, we want a first 
rate product! 

Now I read in Monday's paper 
that Sedonia Olarlot says that 
we're flying officers bad: and forth 
to attend cocktail parties, that 
we hired the girlfriend of the A.S. 
President to work for us this 
summer, that we've slas~ed 
student organizations budget so 
that we could have telephone 
money to call home. Those charges 
are all ridiculous! The only 
members of the A.S. who receive 
any remuneration are the paid 
office staff, Le. our secretaries. 
Neither Jeff Leifer, nor Mark 
Sindler, nor anyone's girlfriend 
receives or has received a salary 
from the Associated Students. 
Further, during this sununer, no 
one, I repeat, De ODe in any 
capacity, be It clerical or official 
received any &Upend for their 
labor. The A.s. simply hasn't 
enough money to pay people. 

We are not an oligarchic 
organization designed to rip4 the 
students at UCSD. We are not an 
administrative puppet designed to 
placate the students of UCSO. We

they desire from the AssociatO!!d 
Students. 

We are a bard working group who 
have been busting buna in an effort 
to see that students are not cheated 
out of -representation by ad-
ministrators-« other studelU. We 
are a group of very tired people, 
who. feeling not a liWe besieged, 
desperately want to get aome sort 
of feedback from students on what 

Thla leUer may sound like it's 
filled with righteous indignaUon, 
and, in part, I guess it Ia. I per-
sonally have worked too hard for 
the past three months to see one 
cheap shot after another taken for 
the gospel truth. The Associated 
Students, in its latest incarnation, 
has an opportunity to wield see

If you have a banking question you'd like answered, Bank of

That's because our Consumer Information Reports cover a 

wide variety of banking subjects. Including, "A Guide to Checks and 
Checking" which explains what you need to know about cashing 
and depositing checks, holds, and stop·payment procedures. We also 
offer Reports on: "How to Establish Credit:' "Ways to Save Money;' 
"Rights and Responsibilities: Age 18" and more. 

And our Consumer Information Reports are free at anyone 
of our branches. 

Of course, we have a variety of other banking services, as well. 

BANK OF AMERICA NT&SA. MEMBER FDIC 

Like College Plan " Checking Personal Choice Savings Plans, and 
if you qualify, Student BankAmericard<ll- Visa and overdraft

with no obligation to sign up for anything. 

You see, we figure the more you know about banking, the 
more likely you are to bank with the bank that can do you the most 
good, both in school and after. 

Quite a few Californians think that's us. And we're hoping you'll 
come to the same conclusion. 
Depend on us. More Callfomla coDege students do.
