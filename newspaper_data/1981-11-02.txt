Our 'friend' Khadafy 
Muammer Khadafy i 'n't t he sort of guy you'd bring home for 

dinner. 
Yes, he's better looking than PLO leader Yasir Arafat, and yes, 

he has that charming Pepsodent smi le. 
But the nu merou spell ings of his name are enough to arouse 

any hostess' anxiety. Is it Kh adafy, Gaddafi, Quatafi or Qaddafl? 
And where do you seat a man who is a lways seen raising a 
clenched fi ·t on the dinner-t ime news? There's something 
suspicious alxlut t his Lib~'a n whom Jimmy Carter calls 
"su bhuman" and Gerald Ford says i" a bu II)'. 

In recent months. Khadafy hasn't done much to allay his 
menaci ng reputation. In Chad, a country his army virtua ll y 
o(cupies, he's massed troops on the border ~\' Ith the Sudan, 
which may be t he next nat Ion on hIS hIt lIst. li e s a Iso praIsed hIs

Indeed, no foreign leader ;,cnds more chIlls through Amencans

enigmatic. 

Herman F. Eilts, former US aJTIbas~ad()r to Egypt and 'audi

Khadafy: . 
"He'" got this peculiar quality of betng able to say. \\Ith an

A major problem we face is

Women's child-bearing restrictive 
Editor: 

I wou ld It ke to comment on 
Glen and h arer's ed ito ri al 
on "the future of th women's 
movement " (Guardial/ , Ocl. 
29). 

What can cons tr a in a 
woman who is int eres ted in a 
ca reer is reconciling h r work 
noL with "the unique ability to 
bear children," bu t with the 
t radit ional role of moth r that 
th is "ability" hilS long implied. 

The ph rase "the unique 
abil it y to bea r ch ild re n" 
dis tu rbs m becaus, unt il 
rece ntl v, society req uired that 
a wo ma n 's child -bca r ing 
function s hape her life and 
ambit ions . Society just ifi ed 
this demand by telling worn n 
that t hey had no reason to try 
to "equal men," s ince they 

\\ ere able t (J perform t Iw most 
importilnt "work" in the wodd 
(a~ if t he fact that a woman 
bore a child made the raisingof 
it a job t hat onl y she was able 
to do). 

An example of thIS atL itude 
is a passage in Robert A. 
Heinlei n's PodkaYl/c of ,Ua ys, 
in wh ich Podkayne, a girl with 
ambitions of becoming a sl>ace 
explorer, observes, looking in a 
mirro r, that she seem:., to be 
"made for havi ng babies," and 
that taking care of babies (as 
many as possible) is the most 
fun a woman cou ld ever ha\' 

he decid s t ha t she really 
would feel out of place as a 
space ca pt ain , but might enjoy 
s up er vi ' in g a spacesh Ip 

nurse r~! A woman s umque 
"abil ity" to have babies (called 

an ahIlit\, though, unlIke tht, 
indl\ IdUill abilit H: ... enc()ur 
aged tn men, \1('lt her the 
abilitv itself nor it s traditional 
impliciltions - the "hom,'· 
\\ ife and mother" role -
tested or de\ eloped a woman's 
intellcct) defined her. 

T he example of men in 
g neral cannot, as Glen and 
, h arer relxlrt that Belly 
Friediln -;uggests, help women 
In whom t he ~ense of 
obligation to fulfIll the 
trad itional "mot h ring" role 
conflicts \\ ith th de>.ire to 
work. Men as a sex, whose 
lIves ha\'e never been define by 
t heir unique reproductive role, 
have not had to feel gu il ty or 
afraid at going to work.

'He didn'l have to listen!' 
Editor: 

After a t tend ing Wednes· 
day's AS Council meet ing 
(Oct ober 28) I am con vinced 
th at the council regards the 
sLudents as little more th an 
rude peasant s who tnterrupt 
their affai rs of state. T he 
actio n s o f two cou nc il 
mem bers du ring the meeting 
illustrate thi ·. 

President jules Bagneri s, 
duri n g st ud e n t in put, 
manilged to stay 'eated and 
po li te ly li s ten to student 
request · and suggest ions for 
less than 10 minute '. Student 
input las ted \ ell over two 
hours. He spent much of hIS 
time pacing abou t the room 
and going outs ide to talk to 
others. 

Reggie Willi ams, however. 
was more blat an t. He s t rolled 
about th room, talki ng to 
friends and ot her counci l 
mem bers, for t he most part 
ignoring the students. who 
were speaki ng. At one pomt m 
the meeting, while a student 
was talk ing about CWO's 
$1.2,500 budget. he came to 
ta lk to a cou nci lman near me. I 
grabbed his arm and said, 
"Wh y don't you listen? He's 
talki ng to you." He replied that 
he didn 't have Lo listen, he had 
hea rd It all before. 

HE DIDN'T HAVE TO 
LIST EN! Is this the counci l 
that said, "We want your 
input?" He didn 't have to 
li s t en , They pent $800 

send ing j ules to Washinton 
O.c. to \'i"it ~oror i ties. He 
didn't have to listen, They 
ga\'e CWO $12,500 to sho\\' 
free fi lms, while other groups 
got cuI. He didn't ha\'e to 
listen. Jules prom ised to veto 
t he decision to bo>'cot t t h 
Chancellor 's inaugu ration if 2 
of the 4 coll eges didn't support 
it. Muir and Third did n't. j ules 
did not veto the decision. He 
didn't have to listen . 

j ules became irate when 
pressed for detaIls ilbout his 
$800 t rip to D.C. Basem Harb 
cou ldn 't unders tand why 
$12,500 was too much for free 
fi lms. And Reggie did n 't have 
to listen.

One rea-.on is that t heexampl

doesn't make an) difference If 
they're in a frat house, dorm,

difference is in the college 

There are man v colleges 
where fraternitIes - act 111 a

that frat house could be

Pacific News Servke 

Strong reactions against security legislation 
By FRANK BROWN ING 

Pacific News Service 
Nearly a year after the 

co n serva t ive Heritage 
Foundation ca ll ed for a 
renewed campa ign agains t 
internal subver ion, Congress 
and the Reagan admini tra· 
tion are on the eve of 
completing a package of new 
laws and executive orders 
unpara lleled sin ce the an ti· 
subversive crackdowns of the 
late 1940s and '50s. 

The Heritage report , 
endore 'ed by presidential 
a d vi ' er Edwin Mee ' e, 
re co m mended restori ng 
secrecy to the activities of law 
enforcement and intell igence 
agencies, and cal led for 
investigations of "clergymen, 
s tudent s, bu s ine ss men, 
entertainers, labor official ', 
journalists and government 
worker s who may engage in 
subversive activities without 
being fully aware of the extent, 
purposes or cont rol of their 
activities." 

Administration and congo 
ressil)n a l s pokes men have 
cited the rising tide of 
international terrorism as 
justification for t he new 
campaign - even as FEr 
director William Webster has 
cut his own counter·terrorist 
squads, citing a decline in 
domestic terrori s t activity 
during recent years. 

Three key move ' are 
expected within the com ing 
weeks: 

- Release of the lo ng· 
awaited Executive Order on 
Intelligence which, according 
to a 23·page draft proposal, 
would remove proscription 
agai nst domestic CIA covert 
operations and permit the CIA 
to re 'ume surveillance on 
American citizens. The order 
also wou ld relieve intelligence 
agencies from t heir current 
requirement · to report crimes 
committed by their members, 
thereby reducing the 
like lihood for prosecu tions of 
illegal "black bag" burglaries 
a nd t he like. 

-Submission of adminis· 
tration legi lation that would 
severely limit release of 
government fi les under the 
Freedom of Information Act. 
The bill wou ld offer complete 
exemptions to t he CIA, the 
National Security Agency and 
the Defen se Enforcement 
Admi nistration, and res trict 
the release of document · 
concerning bu ines es holding 
govern men t contracts and 
those under federal regulation. 

-Passage by the Senate of 
the "Agents Identities Bill, " 
which would make it a crime 
to identify a "covert agent" or 
informer " in the cour e of a 
pattern of activities intended 
to identify and expose covert 
agents and with reason to 
believe such activities wou ld 
impair or impede" foreign 
intelligence activities . 

Aimed direct ly at former 
CIA agent Philip Agee and CIA 

critic Louis Wolf, both noted 
for publishing lists of covert 
agents' names and their 
activities, the bill has pa sed 
the House and is regarded as a 
sure thing in the Senate. 

The two most controversial 
proposals - limiting public 
access to government files 
under ForA and an Execut ive 
Ol'der on nat ional intelligence 
- cou ld trigger t he most 
heated fights the admin istra· 
tion has yel faced . 

Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan (D· 
NY), vice chairman of the 
intelligence committee, ha ' 
ex pres 'ed "genuine concern" 
about a recently released draft 
of the presidential order, w hile 
Sen. Joseph Biden (D·Del.) has 
promised to " 'pend the rest of 
my ca reer in the Senate 
opposing this order." 

Critics of the Agent s 
Identities Bill , particu larly the 
ACLU and the Center for 
National Security Studies, see 
a nearly inevitable Supreme 
Court test as their only hope of 
killing the legislation. They 
argue that newspapers as well 
as anti·CIA groups will be 
su bjected to a virt ual "official 
secrets act" under the new 
deal. Had it been enacted 
earl ier, they say, the bill would 
have blocked pu blication of the 
names and backgrounds of the 
Watergate burglars, many of 
whom were CIA covert agents. 

Rep. Donald Edwards (D· 
Calif. ), chairman of t he House 
Subcommittee on Civil and 

Constitutional Right s , ha ' 
.announced that he intend s to 
fight what he ca lls "the 'e very 
discouraging trend s." 

" Public overs ig ht - not just 
committee oversight of t he FBI 
or the CIA - i ' very 
important," he said. "White 
House directi ves are not 
enough. The pu bl ic has to have 
oversight , too. We cannot have 
secret go\' ernmen t. And that's 
what you will have w hen you 
cut off all these avenue '." 

While the spotlight has 
foc u sed on these broad 
changes , a flurry of smaller 
bi lls and amendm ents so far 
have gone virtua lly unnoticed . 
Several also intensify secrecy 
on intelligence matters; others 
wou ld block application of the 
FOIA by allowing each agency 
to exempt itself from the act. 

Most of these exemptions 
wou ld be s uperceded by a 
general FOIA amendment. But 
fearing that the admi nistra· 
tion's proposals will not pas ' 
this sess ion, many agencies, 
including the Department of 
Energy's nat ional secu rity 
program, the Defense 
Intelligence Agency and the 
Ju stice Department , have 
sought to accomplish the same 
end independently. 

Other recent and pending 
proposals wou ld draw sti ll 
more government agencies 
under the urn brella of national 
security. 

The Treasury Department, 
for instance, has recommend · 

ed that guidelines prohibiting 
the FBI from s pying on 
domest ic po lit ical groups be 
dropped. And the Justice 

Department h as ca nceled 
guidelin es prohibiting the 
prosecution of any govern· 
ment employee who reveals 
confidentia l information 
obtained while he was on the 
job. 

Already passed in the 
budget bill last summer was 
an amendment requiring the 
Cons umer Product s Safety 
Commission ' to withhold 
reports fi led by manufact urers 
on defective project s. And in 
last summer's tax bill, an 
amt"ndment was inserted 
permitting the Int erna l 
Revenue Service to withhold 
gen~ral data on II< audit ing 
procedures. 

David Sobel, general counsel 
for the Wa s hington ·based 
Campaign for Political Right s, 
a coalition of civi l liberties and 
anti·secrecy groups fighting 
the FOIA change ", believes 
that these actions indicate a 
trend 'preading through all 
three branches of government. 
·· It is a tr e nd toward 
re · tri ct ing avenues of 
information that cou ld 
poss ibly relate to oppressive 
government activ it ies. More 
sinister , it is adding authority 
for law enforcement agencies 
to again involve themselves in 
the political arena."

report on CaIPIRG . According 
to Durkin. this non·profit 
co rporation , which i s 
supported by optional s t udent 
funds, loses abot $6,500 to the 
adminis t ration. Because of the 
pre se nt fee procedure 
(collected by the Cashiers at 
the tim of registrat ion ). the 

aoministration withholds :1 1% 
for handling charge ' . With a 
predicted yearly budget of

taken a toll on the budget , said 
Tollner. More than $84 has 
been spent o n flyer ' 
advocating the boycott, he 
·aid. 

Still another topic of student 
a nger was the $800 traveling 
expense account afffored 
Bagneris for attending a 
conference in Was hington 
D.C. sponsored by the Delta 
Sigma Theta 'Orority. Some 
students believe the money 
was spent extravagantly. 

"$800 is a lot of money," said 
one st udent who implied that 
he would rat her have seen the 
money 'pent on beer for a 
TGIF, or on a ski club trip to 
Mammoth . ' Ttl like you 
(Bagneris) to su bmit a report 
of what you expected to get out 
of each of those eight days, and 
what you actually learned ," he 
said . 

Bagneris den ies accusat ions 
that he 'pent the money 
carelessly. Washington D.C. is 
an expensive city. and the 
reason he spent $50 per night 
on a nicer hotel. he sa id , "was 

because the Motel Six was in a 
bad part of town. " 

Delta Sigma Theta is a 
public sev ice soror ity, 
predominantly composed of 
Black, co ll ege-educate d 
women . 

The conference consisted of 
ed ucational workshops to 
inform student leader on 
political issues pertaining to 
the nation, the universitie ', 
and to t he Black community in 
particu lar. One issue 
discussed was " Reaganom· 
ics," and its effects on student 
loans and housing projects, 
'aid Bagneris . 

Bagneris said "it is of 
extreme importance" to the 
AS that student leader ' be 
informed on political issues, 
and t hat attendance at _such 
educationa l workshop ' is 
neces ·ary. 

Commenting on the 
student's complaint · wa ' AS 
advisor Randy Woodard, who 
ha ' worked with the A for 
four years. Defending the AS, 
Woodard said, 'Tm kind of 
sick and tired of hearing that 

the AS is wasting time on 
specia l interest ." Council 
mem ber . spend a great dea I of 
time in the office, he said, and 
students must take more 
initiat ive if problems are to be 
·olved. "Students mu ·t be 
action people rather than 
reaction people," he said. 

After all students had their 
'ay, the cou ncil meet ing 
proceeded with business on 
the agenda. The council voted 
to appruve funding for 
upcoming TGIFs and also for a 
sympos ium on the threat of 
nuclear war, to be held on 
campus Nov. 11. 

The symposium, sponsored 
mainly by the Union of 
Concerned Scientists, will 
feature many speakers, 
including professors from 
UC D. Among them will be 
Biology professor Paul 
altman, and Dr. Herbert 

York, director of the program 
in c ience, Technology and 
Public Affairs, and former 
presidential advisor and 
ambassador to the nuclear test

San Diego physicians 
against nuke war 

Convocation scheduled 
BY THOMAS URBACH 

cienee Edhor 
The tide of pu blic concern 

over nuclear war rises and 
falls . The Nuclear Te ·t Ban 
treaty. signed in 1963, proved 
that pu blic opi nion can in fact 
get things done. The 
Physicians for Social 
Responsibility is one of the 
groups respon s ible for 
informing the public. Dr. 
Ralph Shugart discu 'sed the 
PSR with The UCSD 
Guardian tn a recent 
interview. 

The PSR is an educational 
group dedicated to public and 
profess ional education on the 
medical implication s of 
nuclear technology. The P R 
and the Union of Concerned 
Scienti t are working with 
the UCSD Science, Techno· 
logy , and Public Affairs 
program to spon 'o r a 
convocat ion on the threat of 
nuclear war here at UCSD. 
This convocation on Wednes-
day, Nov. II, is part of a 
nationwide program which 
includes, at last count. 117 
other similar convocations at 
univer si tie s across the 
country. 

In these times when it 'eems 
t hat an individual is powerless 
to change the big picture, the 

PSR is an encouraging model. 
Founded in Boston in 1961, the 
PSR came into existence while 
the US government wa' 
conducting above ground 
nuclear te'ling. The young 
PSR was concerned about the 
effects of fallout, and sought to 
inform the public of the 
pos ' ible health hazards of the 
testing. In 1962, the group 
published two article in the 
pres tigious New England 
jOttrnal of Medicine. These 
articles re ulted in nationwide 
recognition and the group 
became a national organiza-
tion. There are presently forty 
one chapter ' with a total 
membership of around 7000. 

The an Diego Chapter 
began lastJuly and already ha 
one hundred members. The 
local Peace Resource Center 
here in San Diego was 
instrumental in get ting the 
group on it feet. The P Ria 
non·profit organization and 
accordingly find s i(sel f 'hort 
of money. The group is funded 
by a fifteen dollar membership 
fee and by the PSR ational 
offices. 

The P R is a grass root· 
organization, focusing on 
public awareness and 
prevent ative st rategies. The 
group disseminates its 

information through sym-
posia. On Saturday, Oct. 31, 
the Lo ' Angeles Chapter held a 
sympo ium through the UCLA 
extension program. The event 
sold out with about 3,000 
people in aLtendance. The 
program featured per pectives 
on nuclear war from such 
diverse disciplines as 
medicine, s'cience, economic ' 
and p ychology. The convoca-
tion here will be similar, 
though nol as large as the Los 
Angeles symposium. The an 
Diego chapter of the P R 
hope ' to sponsor it · own 
symposium next year. 

[n addition to its educational 
function, the PSR is 
establi 'hing an information 
pool on the effects of nuclear 
war. A subgroup called the 
[nformation and Resource 
Task Force is gathering this 
information in order to provide 
a '01 id dat a base for the 
group' activity . 

Once the P R has dis· 
charged its educational duties 
it offers some cour 'es of 
action. One can join the P R 
which encourages community 
participation and is not 
restricted to physicians. The 
groups also provides informa· 
tion on how to identify and 
contact one's congressman.

UCSD scientist finds 
test for rare diseases 

A lJCSD School of Medicine 
geneticist has developed a 
rapid method of diagnosing 
two rare but devastating 
genetic diseases. 

The UCSD test shorten the 
waiting period for results from 
two months to two days, and 
has been 100% accurate In 
diagnosing methylmalonic 
and proprionic acid mia . 
The. e genet ic diseases begin 
to manife · t themselve ' 
shortly after birth. and are so 
difficult to treat that they 
often re ult in death in 
infancy. 

The test developed by UC D 
scientist Lawrence weet· 
man, Ph.D., can identify the 
disea ' es prenatally by 
examining the amniotic fluid 
that urrounds a developing 
fetu . With the assi ·tance of 
other scientist · Sweetman 
was able to obtain samples of 
amniotic fluid from eighteen 
pregnant women who were at 
risk of having a baby with 
either methylmalonic or 
proprionic acidemia . 

weetman correctly diag· 
nosed nme of the fetuses as 
affected by one of thedi 'eases. 
and the other nine as healthy . 
His results were verified by a 
standard enzyme assay test 
that takes from ix to eight 
weeks. 

The chief advantage of 
Sweetman's methcxl is Its 
speed. Amniotic fluid amples 
are taken during the mother's 
16th to 18th week of 

pregnancy. With results 
available in two days, the 
mother i . spared the anxiety of 
a long wait and will have 
ufficient time to have an 

abortion , if she choo e . On 
the other hand, the standard 
two month enzyme te t for 
these diseases sometimes puts 
t he mot her beyond the 
acceptable time limit for 
having an abortion. 

Among the di seases that 
weetman plans to study area 

urea cycle disorder, and a 
biotin defici ncy diseae that 
can be treated before birth . 

Sweetman's te t measures 
the levels of metabolites that 
the fet u~ releases mto the 
amniotic fluid. For example, 
both methyl malonic and 
proprionic acidemia cause a 
bottleneck in the digestive 
sy ·tem',' breakdown of food. 
Becaue some of the amino 
acids in the food cannot be 
completely metabolized, a 
poisonous byproduct, methyl-
citric acid. build ' up and i 
released into the amniotic 
fluid. we tman can tell by the 
level of methykitnc acid in he 
fluid " 'het her or not the fet u 
has the di ea!>e. 

weetman is an a 'soclate 
professor of pediatrics, In 
re,.,idence at the UC D chool 
of Medicine. Hi,., collaborator 
on this research are Dr. \'ante 
Brandange, at the Uni\'er"ity

----Science humor----
You've heard of hot cars 

BY JOE FALLETTA 
Pfings ten, a friend of mine 

from my other job - the one 
that pays my bi ll s, came over 
th e other day to tell me of his 
latest acqu isition for his car. 
To go along with the super-
high perform ance 400 cubic 
inch beIchfire suckgas racing 
machine he added a nuclear 
ignition. 

"You see, it in ject · a 
fi sionable atom here which 
splits and gives me twice my 
twice my norma l horse-
power, " he explained . [ wasn't 
s ure whet he r he h ad 
memori zed a !)rochure or 
actuall y understood it all. 
"Cooling water is inject ed here 
and leaves here. The place 
where I bought it told me the 
fi shing usuall y improves near 
the ou tl ts of Ihese things." "[ 
have to be careful. though ," he 
added. his eyebrows raising 
and crinkling his forehead as if 
10 give t he statement credence. 
" If [ wind the engine out too 
fa b!. she could melt down." 

[ was impressed, really 
impres ·ed . [ didn 't realize the 
consumer end of nuclear 
power had come so far. "You 
get it last week?" I asked him. 

"Yeah. rd have made it to 
work Friday but it took me a 
while to get the thing 

approved. The paperwork on 
these things is incredible." He 
gestured out wi t h his hand ' to 
lT)e as though measuring the 
fish that got away. "r had to 
have the engine X·rayed and 
picturs taken of each gasket. I 
had to show evacuat ion plans 
for anyone who comes within 
10 miles of the hood. And 
befor [ could even pick it up I 
had to hold a public hearing at 
my place and show the plans to 
my neighbors." 

"Wow." I ·aid. "Was it 
worth it? 1t really sounds like a 
lot of work and aggravation." 

"Oh. yea h." Pfingsten's 
eyes became large and round 
as his mouth opened in a wide 
grin. "The horsepower, the 
performance is terrific. Hop in . 

" Here." He reached into his 
wallet and pulled out a twenty. 
Folding it in fours and stuffing 
it halfway into the grill over 
the radio speaker he told me I 
cou ld keep it if I could grab it as 
he pulled out of the parking lot. 
This time. my eyes got big and 
wide. 

I fastened my seat belt and 
shoulder harness as Pfingsten 
switched on the ignition and 
the engine roared to life. "It 
doesn't 'ound any different." I 
mused. 

"Yah. But just wail now." 

No sooner had he gotten the 
words out than he punched the 
accelerator to the floor and let 
th clutch ou t. My next 
thoughts of anything were lost 
a ' my h ad 'napped violently 
rearward against t he padded 
h ead rest. M y r e fl ex 
movement in the opposing 
direct ion he shifted wa ' so 
quick thegla 'ses flew from my 
no ·e. 

I 'pentthenexttwohoursof 
that ten -minute break 
wondering if I would make It 
back to work alive and, if I did . 
whet her I wou ld be sufficient -
ly ca lm again to stay at my 
bench . 

"Th reo What'd vou I hink ." 
he asked as he helped me from 
th car. I was a little wobbly. 

"Yeah. well L" was all I 
could manag . The con.'umer 

nd of nuclear power HAD 
come a long way_ 

Later I a!-'ked him , "You 
think you'lI take that out to 
Cajon or someplace like that 
and race It ?" 

"Yeah. probably but not 
here. I'm moving the end of t he 
month to Arizona." he 
confessed. "Moving? Why. 
buddy?" 

"Have to." he muttered as 
he took a swig from his coffee. 
" Too man y eart hquakes , 
here."

Intramural names bring 
interest to sports 

BY LARRY GOLDMAN 
SllIff Wrile r 

Intramural teams here at 
UCSD in many cases have 
names which are a lot better 
than the team '. Team name " 
can be bas icall y broken up into 
fi ve categories. Name are 
either crude a nd/ or sexual, 
normal , s trange , have an 
unknown meaning (except to 
that team), and sport-oriented . 

How do team names affect 
record s? In football it seems 
tha t t he crude and/ or sexual 
named teams are either the 
best teams or the worst. 
Teams like H.O.M.O.S_, Plain 
Wrap Prophy lactics, Easy 
Meat , and Bladder Controi are 
all 4-0. Other crude teams are 
not too good . Plug the Hole (0-
3) has yet to enter a winning 
score wh ile Squat and Thrust 
(1-4) seems to be mi ssing 
something, Whore- Moans (0-4) 
ju ·t make a lot of noise but 
don't really care, and Get'm 
Down and Lick (2-2) ha been 
preoccu pied . 

There are two teams called 
the 6ger's and their total 
record is 6-2_ They are not in a 
bad po ition but The 
Penetration and Deepes t 
Penetration have a cumulati ve 
record of 0-8 and it has been a 
frustrating season for them . 

A few strange names in 
football have done well but the 
majority have not. Blues for 
Allah and White Punks on 
Dope are 4-0 while Fighting 
Snails (1-3), Too Foobar (0-4), 
We are the Dead (1-3) and The 
An t People (0-4) (The Ant 
People!?) haven ' t had much 
lu ck. 

Unknown teams such as 
TDH, BSU, S.wAM.P_ Inc., 
and OOMA GOOMA have a 
total record of 13-3_ On the 
other hand s port -oriented 
team names s uch as Free 
Agents, Kiss my Pass, and 

Huddle Cuddle and Score have 
a combined record of 4-8. 

Team s with normal na mes 
have bas ica ll y done we)) s uch 
as Harambe Warrior ' (4-0), 
Slugo' s crap Yard (3- 1), and 
the c1as ' ic footba ll team name, 
Pigs, (4-0). 

Some 0/ these 
names reflect the 
ulterior motive 0/ 
the team, while 
some 0/ them 
represent the true 
athletic interest 0/ 
the squad. We'll 
let you decide. In 
any case, the 
record and team 
name usually 
have a direct 
correlation. 

In floor hockey teams falling 
under the crude and/ or sexual 
category have done well. In the 
Crease With Lots of Grease is 
3-0 while Slick Sticks are 2-0. 
Puck Me In The Ear is the 
strangest name in floor hockey 
and t hey are I-I. As in foot ball , 
the teams with Sport-oriented 
names have not done too well. 
Pucks Up , What the Puck Year 
10, and Puckers have an 
overall record of 1-9. 

In bas ketball, crude named 
teams have been succes ful 
again_ Spread, Penetrate and 
Shoot has been kept happy at 
12-2 and See Men Shoot is 7-3. 
In the strange category is the 
World Class Pig Dogs who 

have a strange sty le of play -
record 1-15. 

Un like the other sports, in 
bas k tball th sport -oriented 
team n ame ' h ave had 
moderate success. Swi -hhh is 
11 -5, On The Rebound 10-4. 
and Dribblings 8-6. HCM 's fa ll 
in the unknown category and 
wis h to remain there at 0-10. 

In tenni ' the team name' 
are all sport-oriented except 
for White Punks on Dope (2-0). 
Strung Out (2-0) a nd Luv'em 
n' Leave'em (3-0) have been 
playi ng well w hile upreme 
Court (0- 2) is looking for a new 
line judge. 

In water polo the sexual 
Barriers to Entry are 3-0 but 
the crude Urine Our Way is I-
2. Rubber Bagels at 1-4 don 't 
know what category they fall 
under. 

In Voll ey ball most of the 
crude and /or 'exual names 
have not done too wei!. 
Bumpin-Pumpin -Thumpin 
have been bumped, pumped, 
and thumped to loll . Oral Six 
is 2-10. Strange teams s uch as 
Death from Above, Abra 
Cadavers, and Eat Dead 
People have a cumulati ve 
record of 13-20. 

Sport -oriented and norma I 
teams have had good success 
in volleyball. Dig 'Em i 12-0, 
Violent ets 11-7, Blue Light 
10-2, and Heavy Hitters 9-3. 

Finally in Ultimate Frisbee 
the Di sc Lickers are 2-0 while 
Hern iated Discs are I- I. AI 0 
Slipped Discs have yet to fall at 
3-0. 

The next time you name an 
Intramural Team you might 
want to keep these results in 
mind. Then again, you might 
not. Note: Playoffs in 1M 
football start thi s week. 

Could it be that these skis slopes_ Weatherman say 
may soon see the soft snow of yes!

How many corporations would be willing to pay 
you over $800 a month during your junior and 
senior years just so you'd join the company after 
graduation? Under a special Navy program 
we're doing just that. It's called the Nuclear 
Propulsion Officer Candidate-College Program. 
And under it, you'll not only get great pay during 
your junior and senior years, but after 
graduation you'll receive a year of valuable grad-
uate-level training that is not available from 
any other employer. 

If you are a junior or senior majoring in 
math, engineering or physical sciences, find out 
more today. And let your career pay off while 
still in college.
