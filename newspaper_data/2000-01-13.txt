PIN: U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (0 - Calif.) talks with democratic supporter Murray Galinson 
at the School of International Relations and Pacific Studies Saturday. 

Boxer Discusses Foreign Policy 
FORUM: Senator discusses changes needed in new era of global politics 
By scon DOBROSIU 
Stsff Writer 

U.s. Senator Barbara Boxer 
(D - Calif.) addressed foreign 
policy improvements and 
changes last Saturday at a lun-
cheon hosted by the UCSD 
Graduate School of International 
Relations and Pacific Studies. 

Boxer said that U.S. foreign 
policy must change in accor-
dance with the ever-changing 
global economy. 

"We all need to work togeth-
er to gain international democ-
racy," she said. "We need to 
share information, and while 
our nationa.! security is first and 
foremost our main concern, 

. changes in U.S. foreign policy 
must be made." 

Boxer said that the United 
States must change its stan-

dards in dealing with foreig!' 
affairs in order to better cope 
with diverse problems that it 
cannot always properly handle 
due to present laws and restric-
tions. Boxer's proposed foreign 
policy plan contains three main 
themes. 

Boxer said that the United 
States must be " increasingly 
flexible" when dealing with 
international affairs. She added 
that the traditional, less-flexible 
approach in dealing with differ-
ent countries will not work 
anymore because each country 
possesses distinct problems 
that requi re distinct solutions . 

Boxer's second theme for 
improving foreign policy is to 
"place a human face on interna-
tional relations." 

HI believe a human face is 
necessary in not just dealing 

with the international diplomats, 
but also with the actual people of 
other nations," she said. 

Boxer's final theme for her 
new policy included achieving 
"multilateral mechanisms" to 
improve foreign policy around 
the world . She said that 
improved world communica-
tion can enhance global foreign 
policy because it will allow for 
the use of global resources to 
solve global problems. 

One prime example Boxer 
used to iOustrate her new plan is 
the current relationship between 
Mexico and the United States. 
Boxer spoke about an influx of 
illegal narcotics from Mexico 
into the United States and how 
the United States should proper-
ly deal with this problem.

Parking 
Spaces 
Created 
TRANSPORTAnON: 
729 new spaces created 
east of Interstate 5 

VINCENT GRAGNANI 
News Editor 

In order to accommodate stu· 
deRt needs, Transportation dnd 
Parking Services recently opened 
729 parking spaces by Voigt Drive 
on the east side of Interstate 5. 

Director of Parking and 
Transportation Services Greg 
Snee said that the new lot on the 
east side of campus provides 
enough spaces for students . 

"With the opening of the sec-
ond phase of the Regents lot, we 
should have overly sufficient 
parking for the rest of the acade-
mic year," Snee said. 

In order to accommodate stu-
dents parking in the new lots, the 
Regents express shuttle was insti-
tuted last fall, and runs along Voigt 
Drive and Matthews Lane between 
the new lot and the Price Center. 

The shuttle makes four stops 
and runs every seven minutes dur-
ing morning and . afternoon and 
every ten minutes in the evening. 

Snee said last year that Winter 
quarter is typically the most 
crowded quarter for student 
parking. Last winter, student 
parking spaces in all parking lots 
were full during peak hours and 
students had to be directed to lots 
across.North Torrey Pines Road . 

. Construction is also progress-
,ing on two new parking structures, 
one on Gilman Drive and another 
on North Torrey Pines Road. 

Snee said that both are expect-
ed to open in fall 2000.

REMOVAL: Assistant Vice Chancellor Tom Collins describes man as homeless and a 'nuisance' 
By LAUREN I. COARTNEY 
SIB" Writer 

Campus police asked a man 
to leave a geomagnetism class 
taught by Professor Lisa Tauxe at 
Scripps Institute of 
Oceanography on Nov. 29, 1999. 
The man, who identified himself 
as Dr. Bob Smith, said that the 
action was discriminatory 

Smith has been regularly sit-
ting in on classes at UCSD and 
Scripps for about two years, but 
this is the first time he has ever 
been asked to leave. He said he 
was Si~~: jI hall 10 feet out-
side the because it was full 
and that he is stiIJ unsure why he 
was asked to leave. 

Smith said he is working on 

research with some of the faculty 
and that he was taken aback 
when. campus police aiked him 
if he was homeless. 

''I'm not homeless," Smith 
said. "1 have three condos. I have 
two Ph.D.s and a law degree and 
they're treating me like a vagrant. 
If they had asked me nicely to 
leave, that would have been fine 
but there was no need to involve 
higher administration." 

Assistant Vice Chancellor 
Tom Collins, the man Smith 
alleges had him removed from 
the class, said that SmIth did not 
have permission, to be sitting in 
on the class. 

"He's welcome to sit in on 
classes if he has the written con-
sent of the instructor," Collins 

said. "Nobody that I know of has 
given him written consent." 

Smith said he sits in on classes 
not for the credits but to further 
his intellectual development. 

UCSD Police Detective Nate 
Floyd ' said many people have 
complained about Smith. 

"We've had quite a few calls 
about him," Floyd said. "Police 
have been dispatched on several 
occasions, but he's always gone 
by the time they get .there. He 
wanders around the buildings 
and uses the fax and copy 
machines." 

Collins said that others on 
campus describe him as a gener-
al nuisance. 

"He has the appearance of a 
homeless person and carries 

around plastic shopping bags full -
of stuff: Collins said. "He's made 
it a point to attend Scripps events 
that are really only for university 
employees and their guests." 

Smith said that the Nov. 29 
incident is part of a growing 
trend. 

''I'm an outSider," he said. 
"I've always found people in the 
geological and biological sciences 
to be a little anal retentive. They 
don't want you sitting in on their 
class, what are they afraid of?" 

Smith said that the incident 
raises questions about the diver-
sity the university tries to 
uphold and that he will continue 
to sit in on classes to further his 
knowledge of sciences and other 
subjects that interest him.

Association of America joint meeting in Washington, 
D.C. 

Campbell will present a paper at the joint meeting 
on a project she participated in last summer at the 
National Science Foundation Research Experiences 
for Undergraduates (REU). The paper, which is on the 
Igusa local zeta function for different reduction types 
of special fiber of an elliptIC curve, is being prepared 
for publication. She has presented speeches on this 
research at Mathfest '99 in Providence. R.I., the 
UCSD Number Theory Seminar. the University of San 
Diego Symposium and the Mount Holyoke Summer 
Reseatch Symposium. Campbell is currently working 
on extending the research from the REU project to 
hyperelliptic curves. 

Campbell presented speeches on complete graphs 
on surfaces, on genus g and the Map Color Theorem 
at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J. 
and on braids at the UCSD Undergraduate Knot 
Theory Seminar. 

Campbell's projects include finding low-degree 
rational approximations to the Navy's antenna data 
and the mathematics of card shuffling. She has taken 
two graduate courses: Analytic and Algebraic Number 
Theory and Fourier Analysis on Finite Groups. She has 
also been a t~hing assistant in calculus and a pri-
vate tutor. 

The award was named after the former presIdent 
and founding member of AWM and professor emeri-
ta of Wellesley College. Alice T. Schafer. in 1990

explain how measuring the speed of stars, galaxies 
and other objects in space gives clues as to 
whether or not the universe will continue to expand 
and if it will eventually collapse. 

Griest will also share his expertise in the mys-
tery of identifying dark matter, the unexplained sub-
stance in space that ultimately determines the fate 
of the universe. Griest will present his research,

"Most people don't think 
about marijuana in relationship to 
cancer," Zhang stated. "The car-
cinogens in marijuana are much 
stronger than those in tobacco." 

Zhang's study began in 1993 
when Zhang was in New York 
City. He interviewed hospitalized 
patients using a questionnaire. 

He posed three questions to 
173 patients who had head and 
neck cancer and to 176 patients 
without cancer. 

"Patients were asked if they 
had ever used marijuana, how 
many years they have used it, 
and how many times a day they 
would smoke it," Zhang stated. 

The data was analyzed at 
UCLA in 1997. Zhang and his 
team found that marijuana smok-
ing is a.risk factor for head and 
neck cancer. 

Because head and neck cancers 
- cancers of the mouth, tongue,

according to a recent article

Boxer later said that college 
students can get actively 
involved in politics and in 
improving foreign policy by 

lea~ning aQol,lt the issues and act-
ing on them. 

Boxer said she offers intern-
ships to college students interested 
in govemment policies. She also 
said that groups such as The Peace

Borders are great organizations for 
students to become involved with.

The results of the study, titled 

"Systematic Social Observation of 
Public Spaces: A New Look at 
Disorder in Urban 

eighborhoods," contradict the 
popular "broken windows" theo-
ry that, accordi~g to ~mpson, 
says "signs of disorder In public 
places attract predatory crime 
because potential offenders 
assume from them that the resi-
dents are indifferent to what goes 
on in their neighborhoods." 

Sampson's study instead 
reverses that claim. 

" Instead of conceiving of dis-
order as a direct cause of crime," 
Sampson said, " the study'S 
authors view many elements of 
disorder as part and parcel of 
crime itself." 

The study found that garbage 
on the street is the direct result of 
littering and drinking in public. 
While it might not be considered 
serious by most people, it is still 
an ordinance violation. 

"The factors that produce [less 
serious crimes) may be the same 
factors that produce more serious 
crime," Sampson said.

AOL-Time Warner Merger 
Endangers Consumers 

On Monday, Internet service provider America 
Online announced that it will purchase media giant 
Time Warner for $160 billion - a deal that will be 
the largest corporate merger in U.S. history if it goes 
through. The proposed resulting company would be 
called AOL Time Warner. 

The announcement marks 'the first major deal in 
which an Internet company ha purchased a corpora-
tion with traditional media assets. The new company 
will control Time Magazine, Warner Brothers movies 
and televi ion, Turner Broadcasting, CNN, HBO, 
Netscape and - of course - AOL, the world's largest 
Internet service provider with 22 million subscribers. 

The Guardian is wary of such a large-scale merg-
er between two media companies. Although the two 
companies currently operate in what are very differ-
ent areas of media broadcasting, pa t large media 
mergers have only served to limit the di ver ity of the 
mate rial that the indu try produces. The print and 
movie industries are prime examples of how central -
ized ownership can effectively marginalize smaller 
companies and make it difficult for the market to 
support a diversity of products. 

Under thi deal, more consumers wiU receive con-
tent from a single media source, continuing a trend that 
Time Warner itself started when Time Inc. and Warner 
Communications Inc. first merged in 1990. Already, 
rumors about similar mergers in response to AOt's 
announcement abound. including a merger between 
Yahoo! and Disney (rumors that both companies have 
vehemently denied). Regardless of the validity of any 
rash specUlation, the AOL-Time Warner deal certainly 
will set a precedent that will encourage ever larger 
mergers and further stratification of the media. 

Another concern is the fate of the rapidly growing 
cable modem industry. Time Warner owns 
Roadrunner, which provides high-speed cable 
modem access to the Internet to consumers across the 
country, including many San Diegans. With this 
acquisition. AOL will considerably increase its own-
ership of Internet access. 

In the past, AOL has been quite vocal in encour-
aging AT&T. which has recently been buying up a lot 
of the cable infrastructure required to provide high-
speed access to computer users, to open up its cable 
access to allow independent providers to take advan-
tage of its networks. It remains doubtful whether 
AOL will continue to champion the cause of smaller 
service providers now that it has secured ownership 
of va"st cable modem resources for its own use. 

The future of media certainly seems to be leading 
to the merger of the Internet and traditional media. 
The Guardian had hoped that this exciting new fron -
tier of media would be free of the monotonous cor-
porate bias and lack of diversity that has plagued 
newspapers, television and feature films. Hopefully 
the new company will not abuse its power and 
neglect the interests of its consumers as so many 
other media giants have done in the past.

Sixth College Lacks Diversity 
COMMENTARY: Academic program does not include the breadth of other colleges 
.By KEVIN SEJD , 
Staff Writer 

As the UCSD student population 
continues to grow exponentially, 
plans are currently underway to 
build a sixth undergraduate college. 

The first phase of the project was 
completed when the Academic 
Senate approved a theme and a pre-
liminary academic plan for the new 
college. The "art, culture and tech-
nology" theme of the sixth college 
will highlight the impact of art and 
technology on culture and society. 

The jewel of the college would be 
a structured three-quarter, freshman 
core sequence examining this theme 
of art, culture and technology. The 
three classes would examine this 
theme's relation to the past, present 
and future. The first quarter would 
cover the history of art and technol-
ogy. The second quarter would 
examine modem and present issues 
with an emphasis on critical reading 
and rigorous writing. The third 
quarter would examine the future, 
consisting of group projects empha-
sizing written and oral communica-
tion skills. 
FI_. NMd Addr ..... 

However, the. proposed curricu-
lum outline has major flaws that need 
to be addressed. As it stands now, the 
college would be extremely different 
from the other five colleges. It resem-
bles an academic program more than 
a general education program. This 
would negatively affect the educa-
tional experiences of those UCSD stu-
dents attending Sixth College. 

A curriculum resembling an aCjld-
emic program was probably the goal 
of the Sixth College planning com-
mittee. Its report to the Academic 
Senate states the follOWing: "An art, 
culture and technology theme would 
be distinct from the other UCSD col-
leges and unique in higher education 
today as a focal point of a major aca-
demic unit. 

Much has been written of late in 
the popular preSs and scholarly jour-
nals on the relationship of art and 
science and the need for interdisci-
plinary education, but few academic 
programs exist today tha t act on this 
emerging current." 

The theme wouJd examine the 
work of two highly visible industries 
in California: entertainment and 
high technology. But a focus on spe-
cific industries and fields would 
undermine UCSD's undergraduate 
college system. 

The whole idea of UCSD's unique 
system is to let students experience 
the intimacy of a smaIJ college while 
benefiting from the academic advan-
tages of a major univerSity. By gear-
ing the college's general education 
requirements toward specific indus-
tries, Sixth College would be 
designed to serve certain disciplines. 
D.p ........... ... 

At UCSD, it is the job of the acad-
emic departments and programs, not 
the colleges, to educate students on 

It is hard to imagine an 
arts and technology theme 
attracting a wide range of 
students from different 
cultures, ethnic groups and 
interests. 

industry-based issues. 
In addition, the college may not 

attract a very diverse student body. 
Diversity is an extremely important 
component of education. Access to a 
variety of ideas, customs and values 
helps students become more effec-
tive in interacting with our society, 
which is enriched by many cultures. 

It is hard to imagine an arts and 
technology theme attracting a wide 
range of students from different cul-
tures, ethnic groups and interests. It 
is true that entertainment and tech-
nology are two highly visible indus-
tries. 

But that does not necessarily 
mean that all cultural and ethnic 
groups have equal representation or 
interest in these fieldS. The ethnicity 
of a student and his or her leve] of 
interest in arts and technology are 
two completely independent factors. 

Another reason Sixth College 
resembles an academic department 
is that its general education require-

ments do not provide a diverse acad-
emic program. In addition to the 
freshman core sequence, students 
would also be required to take three 
courses in each of the following 
areas: natura] sciences, social sci-
ences and humanities .• The college 
would lack the foreign language, 
math and computer science require-
ments that other colleges have. 

Compare the Sixth College acade-
mic plan to the more diverse pro-
gram of Thurgood Marshall College. 
Marshall's academic plan is similar 
because its freshman core sequence, 
Dimensions of Culture, also spans 
three academic quarters. But 
Marshall students also take two 
courses in math or logic, two courses 
in humanities, one course in natural 
sciences and one course in fine arts. 
There is also a disciplinary breadth 
requirement in which students take 
four courses in a different discipline 
from that of their major. 

John Muir College's flexible gen-
eral education requirements are 
more diverse than the proposed 
Sixth College plan, as well. Muir stu-
dents take two expository writing 
courses, one math or natural science 
sequence, one social science 
sequence, and two sequences select-
ed from two of the three following 
areas: humanities, fine arts or foreign 
languages. 
.. 1 .• LIIok ................ 

A diverse range of general educa-
tion requirements benefits all stu-
dents because it provides the oppor-
tunity to gain some experience in 
several fields. Such requirements 
also help undeclared students by 
aUowing them to explore different 
fields and prepare them for a broad 
array of majors. Without diverse 
reqUirements, many will be unpre-
pared for certain diSCiplines. 

The Sixth College plan should be 
sent back to the drawing board. The 
new college must not be just another 
academic program. ]t must adhere to 
the philosophy of the UCSD under-
graduate system and the multiple 
college campus with a full set of 
diverse general education require-
ments. We must not lose this unique 
distinction that our university and 
its students ~re so deeply.

Racism Endures in Society 
COMMENTARY: Misconceptions are still rampant 
despite all the advancements of this century 
By JENNIFER SPOSITO 
Staff Writer 

At the end of a century of 
countless American civil rights 
movements, we would like to 
think that we made some 
progress as a nation toward elim-
inating racism in this country. 
Those who were completely dis-
enfranchised 100 years ago now 
have rights that are protected, at 
least in name, by legislation. 

However, the struggle for 
equali ty is not so 

excess attention to a person's race 
- that I see so frequently and 
with more vehemence nowadays. 
People don't realize that they 
often poison their stories and 
speech with bitter prejudice. 

I had an experience a few 
months ago that illustrates this 
perfectly. r was talking about ten-
nis with two friends - one is a fan 
of the tennis star Venus Williams, 
and said so during the conversa-
tion. Immediately, my other friend 
looked spiteful and said, "Venus 

Williams is such a 
easily won. If we 
were judged solely 
on our laws, the 
United States 
would indeed 
seem to be the 
haven of racial 
equality that it is 
made out to be. In 
reality, the every-
day thouKhts and 
actions 01 people 
define the- racial 
situation in the 
United States, and 
these factors . con-

Th~ battle for 
equality has gone 
undetlJround, out 
of the spotlight and 
into our thoughts 
and actions, an 
area that we don)t 
often stop to . 
analyze. 

stupid name. Why 
do black people . 
have to give their 
kids such weird 
names? Why can't 
they give them 
normal names?" 

I was stunned. 
My every instinct 
cried out in me 
that what she was 
saying was repre-
hensible. Of 
course, instead of 
being able to 
berate her right 

vince me that racism is still ram-
pant here. The battle for equality 
has gone underground, out of the 
spotnght and into our thoughts 
and actions - an area that we 
don't often stop to analyze. 

My personal definition of 
racism is a stereotype, descrip-
tion, label or identification of 
someone that unnecessarily 
draws either excess or pejorative 
attention to the person's race. I 
have been fortunate that the pe0-
ple I have been around for most 
of my life have not resorted to 
taunting someone else about his 
or her race. Instead, it is the first 
part of my definition - drawing 

then and there, as I should have 
done, I thought of a witty and 
pertinent response about three 
hours later, after everyone had 
gone home. All the same, it was a 
conversatiun that stayed with me 
for several weeks: 

What would possess a person 
to say something like that? I 
would like to be flippant and say 
that it was due to my friend's 
Orange County upbringing, but 
that wouldn't be fair. Whatever 
the motivation, her statement was 
obviously completely unfounded. 
What is a normal name? One of

Holiday Madness 
COMMENTARY: Seasonal frenzies of 
decoration buying are misguided and irritating 
By CASSANDRA PIERCE 
§t8ff Writer 

My family was one of the last 
on our block to put up Chrisbnas 
lights this year - and one of the 
first to take them down on Jan: 2. 
Our neighbor across the street put 
them up earlier than we did -
and he's Jewish! 

Such events make me question 
our society's values. Not that 
complaining about them will do 
any good. I'm convinced that 
another neighbor was seriously 
expecting alien contact on New 
Year's Eve; his house was bright 
enough to serve as a landing strip. 

My father still has the same 
outdoor Chrisbnas lights that he 
bought about three years ago, in 
the height of the pastel fad . So our 
pale pinks, blues and greens flick-
er in an attempt to chase one 
another around the window, the 
lower eaves and a tree that's off to 
the side of the yard. This year, I 
helped by contributing my own 
artistic statement: I grabbed four 
strands of plain white lights, 
dumped them in a relatively even 
clump on my second-story win-
dow sill, and plugged them in. I 
titled it, HDo I Look OK?" 

At least our house doesn't look 
like it's covered with short-cir-
cuiting icicles. 

I remember looking for a last-
minute Halloween decoration on 
Oct. 30. I went to a craft store near 
my house and was shocked that 
the Halloween decorations had 
been relegated to a small quarter 
of an aisre to make way for the 
Christmas decorations already 
overwhelming the store. And now 
I'm seeing heart-shaped candy 

boxes at Wal-Mart. People are 
buying valentines 32 days early! 

Furthermore, I can hardly 
remember the last time I saw 
Thanksgiving decorations, even 
the childish ones of little pilgrims 
and American Indians. I remember 
a few that my parents had about six 
years ago - the honeycomb fold-
out kind. We had a turkey one for a 
centerpiece, and we always went to 
Sacramento for Thanksgiving. We 
weren't trying to impress anyone. 

What are we missing in this 
race from one decorated candy to 
another? What about the other 
holidays? Do you know - with-
out looking it up - what month 
Father's Day falls under? What 
about Mother ' s Day? Do you 
know which one comes first? 
When is Veteran's Day? Labor 
Day? Memorial Day? When is 
Martin Luther King Jr. Day? (No, 
not the day we get off from 
school.) When is it, really? What 
about Lincoln's birthday? 

Most of these holidays celebrate 
people who made an indelible 
influence on our lives. After ele-
mentary school, however, there is 
little emphasis on decorations cele-
brating these holidays. This tradi-
tion of putting up decorations has a 
nice ring to it, as if these holidays 
are above materialism in a way that 
chocolate rabbits and leprechauns 
cannot compete with. Yet, based 
upon my own answers to the quiz 
above, all the cute, frivolous sym-
bols of other holidays obscure 
these more sensible holidays. 

It would be nice if, for once, 
Christmas lasted only 12 days, as 
in the song. Maybe I'm old-fash-
ioned. I guess I womdn't really 
know what to do with 23 birds.

RACISM: 
Everyday comments 
illustrate prejudices 
ContInued from .... I 
Anglo-Saxon derivation? At least 
Venus is the name of a goddess. 
My name, Jennifer, means Uwhite 
wave" in Welsh. I don't think it 
gets much more ridiculous than 
that. 

Too often I hear talk like that of 
my (former) friend. I can under-
stand mentioning race if it can 
help put a story into a particular 
historical or cultural context. But 
otherwise, there is no need to 
emphasize the race of a person in 
the course of conversation. When 
somebody makes a point to con-
vey a person's race in their speech. 
they are subliminally insinuating 
and perpetuating stereotypes. 
What other purpose could gratu-
itously mentioning someone's 
race serve, except to draw upon a 
hostofpneaonceptions? 

Often, a person will couple his 
or her speecn with· an anecdote of 
how enervating a particular 
episode was, and it is by this 
method that racism is perpetuat-
ed. I become very suspicious 
when a person has a gripe and 
makes an effort to point out the 
race of the person involved. In 
typical conversation, one would-
n't expect to hear an emphatic 
story about "this while guy who 
cut me off in traffic today." Hence, 
I don't see why people have to go 
out of their way to make sure that 
I know that the person who cut 
them off in traffic was Mexican. 
As a person of Mexican descent, I 
find that example particularly 
offensive. Mexican Americans cut 
other people off in traffic, but so 
do Caucasian Americans, African 
Americans and Asian Americans. 
I can attest to all of these person-
ally. 

Even when the context is not 
negative, people still use race as a 
convenient labeling tool. If I am 
talking about a group of people 
and I need to call attention to a per-
son in that group who happens to 
be of a different race than the rest, 
I will be very careful not to use his 
or her race as the identifying char-
acteristic. There are certainly other 
things that can be said of a person 
to describe them than simply 
going after the color of that indi-
vidual's skin. I have found that 
people will resort to racial labeling 
too often because it is easy to do. 
What better way to pick someone 
out, they think, than to use the 
most visible label available? 

By labeling someone, one auto-
matically ostracizes. A label sin-
gles people out as being different 
- especially a label relating to 
their appearance. By highlighting 
another person's physical dissimi-
larities in a way that makes that 
individual stand out in a crowd, 
one subjects this person to an 
automatic mental categOrization: 
"different." To see people in fac-
tions, split apart and disper!ed 
does not promote unity. It is offen-
sive to any attempt at progress. 

Racism does not lie onfy in the 
c~imes committed by fanatics 
such as the Ku Klux Klan and 
skinhead groups. Much of it is 
perpetuated because average 
people, in normal speech, are not 
careful enough to think about the 
effects of our words. We do not 
realize that the things we are say-
ing actually have a social impact, 
and that they continually help to 
shape our national conscjousness. 

The progress that we have 
~de fighting racism is nothing if 
It rests upon a weak foundation. 
That foUndation is built on the 
way that everybody thinks and 
speaks each day. Until we change 
our ~havior in this respect, leg-
lSlatlve progress cannot improve 
anything. If our thoughts and 
actions are any indication, we 
have a long way to go before we 
can hope to free the United States 
of racist bias.

C.A.P.E. Policy Violates Purpose 
Editor: 

The GUflrdiall editori-

Students," Dec. 9) and 
related article by Lauren 
Coartney, ("Professor .

sloppy journalism. 
There are two major 
points that need clarifi-
cation. 

First, paragraph four 
of Coartney's article 
suggests that I have out-
lined a set of guidelines 
by which CA.P.E. 
should conduct its 
affairs. On the contrary, I 
was drawing attention 
to C.A.P.E.'s stated pur-
pose as listed on page iii 
of the current edition. 
The purpose listed is 
threefold: to serve stu-
dents, faculty and those 
individuals who evalu-
ate faculty. Overall the

UC Office of the President 
Budget targeted for 
instructional improve-
ment. The $90,000 that

portion of the monies

sound judgment since it is 
currently a major compo-
nent of instructional 
improvement on our cam-
pus. 

On the other hand, if 
C.A.P.E. intends to serve 
only students, as 
CA.P.E.'s director sug-
gests, then it might be 
appropriate for it to 
change its purpose and 
then reapply for funds to 
the Instructional

Committee. I might point 
out that since these are

improve instruction on campus. 

public funds, professors, administrators, 
staff people and students have a voice on 
this committee in determining how well 
CA.P.E. achieves its purpose and the 
extent to which funding should be contin-
ued . 

But how does it improve instruction 
when the CA.P.E. staff sits around the table 
and selects comments for the "Off the Wall" 
section on the basis of outrageousness and 
those that ma~e them laugh [according to 
Coartney's article]? 

While the GlUlrdiJm scolds professors for 
standing up for their convictions, where is 
the call for CA.P.E. to conform to its stated 
purpose? 

Would the GUJlTdiJm prefer that profes-
sors look the other way while C.A.P.E. pro-
motes intellectual mediocrity, cultural and 
gender biases and irresponsibility? 

My second point is that GlUlrJian articles 
make vague references to a "government 
grant" as the basis for CA.P.E.'s financial 
support. This tactic reflects the C.A.P.E. 
director's attempt to establish CA.P.E.'s 
independence from faculty or administra-
tive oversight. The actual source of these 

The GU/lrdian seemed to base its editorial 
mainly on the article by Coartney. My con-
cern is that I stressed the two major points 
cited above and in writing at the time that 
Coartney interviewed me. She recorded the 
session and accepted a copy of "talking

view. 

While the GUArdian has a right to publish 
articles on relevant issues and express its

Iraq Agrees to New Weapons Inspections BRITAIN: 

New policy includes 
because of their homosexuality. 
In ruling against the British gov-
ernment, the court found that its 
ban violated the fundamental 
human right to privacy, as set 
out in the European Convention 
on Human Rights. 

UNITED NATIONS - lraq 
said Wednesday that it would 
allow inspectors from the 
International Atomic Energy 
Agency to visit the country next 
week to check its uranium stock-
piles, ending a monthlong stand-
off between the agency and the 
government of President 
Saddam Hussein. 

The inspections will be the 
first by any outside agency con-
cerned with clandestine 
weapons programs to take place 
in Iraq since December 1998, 
when inspectors from the atomic 
agency were withdrawn in 
advance of U.S. and British 
bombing raids, along with U.N. 
inspectors who monitored bio-
logical, chemical and missile pro-
grams. 

The new inspections are not 
related, however, to the monitor-
ing systems imposed on Iraq 
after the 1991 war in the Persian 
Gulf. 

ext week's inspections are 
related solely to the 1968 nuclear 
nonproliferation treaty, which 
Iraq signed and which demands 
annual inspections of materials 
that could be used to make 
nuclear weapons. Iraq has 1.8 
tons of low-enriched uranium 

and 13 tons of natural uranium. 
Both could be transformed into 
bomb-grade material with the 
right equipment. 

Next week)s inspections 
are related solely to the 
1968 nuclear 
nonproliferation treaty, 
which Iraq signed and 
which demands annual 
inspections of materials 
that could be used to 
make nuclear weapons. 
Iraq has 1.8 tons of 
low-enriched uranium 
and 13 tons of natural 
uranium. Both could be 
transformed into bomb-
grade material with tne 
right equipment. 

By refusing visas to the IAEA 
inspectors, Iraq had put itself in 
violation of the treaty. 

Iraq's decision Wednesday to 

give a green light to the team is 
not totally unrelated to efforts 
here to resume other U.N. arms 
inspections. 

This week, Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan is expected to name a 
chief arms inspector for the new 
monitoring commission creat~ 
in December by the Secunty 
Council to replace UNSCOM -
the U.N. Special Commission-
which had been unable to retum 
to Iraq after the U.S.-led bombing. 

Its executive chairman, 
Richard Butler, resigned last year. 

The Security Council, which 
has been consulting with Annan 
as he makes his choice, has yet to 
agree on a nominee. Several lists 
of candidates have come and 
gone, and sometimes come 
again. 

There has been some specula-
tion this week that Annan may 
try to recall Rolf Ekeus, the 
Swedish diplomat and arms con-
trol expert who created 
UNSCOM in 1991 and led it until 
1996. Ekeus is now Sweden's 
ambassador to the United States. 

Annan is likely to name his 
candidate on Friday, officials and 
diplomats say.

FDA Warns of Overuse of Teachers' Salaries Lagging 
New Drugs Against Flu 

WASHINGTON - As a wide-
spread outbreak of influenza 
swamps hospitals and qoctors' 
offices around the nation, offi-
cia ls at the Food and Drug 
Administration Wednesday 
warned that doctors appear to be 
relying too heavily on two new 
influenza drugs, and said that 
some patients may have died 
because they did not get the 
more aggressive treatment they 
needed. 

The drugs, Relenza by Glaxo 
Wellcome and Tamiflu by 
Hoffman-LaRoche, were both 
approved by the government in 
the last six months and are being 
heavily marketed in television 
and print advertisements. Both 
are intended for patients with 
uncomplicated cases of the flu . 

But FDA officials said 
Wednesday that they had evi-
dence that doctors were prescrib-
ing these new antiviral drugs to 
patients with complicated cases. 
Two flu patients whose condi-
tions were complicated by serious 
bacterial infections were pre-

Continued from paC. 1 
Lycos hanging over them, AOL 
and Time Warner are feverishly 
working to reassure investors 
that their combination makes 
strategic sense, meeting with top 
shareholders, extolling the 
virtues of the deal to the press 
and promising more details 
about linkups between the two 
companies soon. 

Quietly, people close to the 
deal say the drop in AOL shares 
was not surprising, given that 
many AOL investors have come 
to count on an extraordinary 
growth rate and care little about 
traditional measures of stock 
value, like price-to-earnings 
ratios. Because Time Warner is 
growing much more slowly than 
AOL, buying Time Warner will 
dClmpen AOL's growth. Some 
AOL investors are selling their 
share as a re ult. 

scribed Relenza when they 
should have received antibiotics; 
both died, said Dr. Heidi Jolson, 
director of the FDA's division of 
antiviral drug products. , 

Three other very sick flu 
patients taking Relenza also died; 
some might have needed more 
intensive therapy, such as oxygen, 
intravenous fluids and hospital-
ization, Jolson said, 

Deaths among flu patients are 
not uncommon; an estimated 
20,000 Americans, many of them 
elderly and infirm, die of the flu 
every year. 

Doctors have written 300,000 
prescriptions for Relenza, an 
inhaled medication, according to 
Lisa Behrens, a spokeswoman for 
Glaxo Wellcome. Precise figures 
for Tamiflu, which comes in pill 
form, were not available, but the 
prescriptions number in the hun-
dreds of thousands, said Charles 
Alfaro, a spokesman for Hoffman 
laRoche.

Tile Nw York Times 

On Wednesday, AOL shares 
fell $4.SO to $60, and shares in 
Time Warner dropped $5.375 to 
$79.625. While Time Warner's 
stock price remains higher than it 
was on Friday, before tht> deal 
was announced, shares in AOL 
have now lost one-fifth of their 
value in three days. As a result, 
the total value of the two compa-
nies now stands at about $280 
billion. That compares with a 
total value of $300 billion on 
Friday. 

Still, the two companies say 
the volatility will not derail the 
deal. 

AOL and Time Warner exec-
utives spent Wednesday pro-
claiming the strategic benefits 
of their deal and lining up 
influential shareholder to 
express support for it. 
Executives of both companies 
say they remain confident the 
deal will go through, and say 
long-term benefits far outweigh 
any pain from short-term stock 
declines.

The New York Times 

As the nation embarks on a 
decade-long quest to hire 2 mil- . 
lion teachers, teachers' pay con-
tinues to lag far behind that of 
other college-educated profes-
sionals - by an average of near-
ly $8,000 a year at the start of 
their careers and by almost 
$24,000 a year by the time they 
reach SO, a report released 
Wednesday by the journal 
Educatioll Week said. 

The report found the salary 
gap to be greatest when teachers 
with master 's degrees, ages 44 to 
SO, were compared with other 
professionals of the same age 
and with the same level of edu-
cation. The difference in pay in 
that category was $32,511 annu-
ally, with teachers earning 
$43,313 a year, compared with 
$75,824 for other professionals. 

The journal's researchers, 
using census data, determined 
that the average salaries for mas-
ter 's-degree recipients outside 
teaching increased $17,505 from 
1994 to 1998, while the average 

salary of teachers with master 's 
degrees rose by less than $200. 

In responding to the report, Bob 
Chase, president of the National 
Education Association, said: "Por 
all of the discussions about 
schools' adopting efficient busi-
ness practices as a means of 
reform, why should people believe 
the laws of supply and demand 
end at the schoolhouse door?" 

The report documented 
numerous other shortcomings in 
schools' efforts to recruit and 
retain teachers, especially those 
of the highest quality. 

Though the editors found 
that 39 states required prospec-
tive teachers to pass a basic skills 
test "to ensure that they are at 
least literate," 36 of those states 
hi\,ve allowed some teachers who 
have failed such tests to be hired 
anyway. Only nine states require 
middle school teachers to pass 
tests in the subj~ts they teach, 
with the rest permitting middle 
school teachers to teach after 
obtaining broad elementary 

school certificates. 
"While they set standards for 

who can enter the profession on 
the front end," the editors wrote, 
Umost keep the door cracked 
open on the back end." 

Once inside the classroom, 
teachers are unlikely to get the 
training they need, the report 
said. 

The salary gap is largest in 
Louisiana, where college gradu-
ates with at least a bachelor's 
degree earned, on average in 
1998, almost double the salary of 
teachers: $52,379 compared with 
$28,266, the report says. In 
Montana, where the disparity is 
the slimmest, the average 
teacher earns $31,772, compared 
witli $34,971 for other college 
graduates. 

The national average, for 
those who hold at least a bache-
lor 's degree, is $35,048 for teach-
ers, compared with $49,362 for 
other professionals.

Deadline Lifted for Return 
of Rescued Cuban Boy 

WASHINGTO - Attorney 
General Janet Reno on 
Wednesday emphatically reaf-
firmed her belief that Elian 
Gonzalez, the 6-year-old boy 
rescued at sea clinging to an 
inner tube after his mother 
drowned, -should be returned to 
his father in Cuba. 

But in a letter to lawyers for 
the boy's relatives in ' Miami, 
Reno added that immigration 
officials had lifted their Friday 
dead line for Elian to be 
returned. She said the extra time 
would give relatives, who hope 
to keep Elian with them, an 
opportunity to file a federal 
court challenge. 

Meanwhile, the Justice 
Department is conSidering 
going to court to ask a federal 
judge to enforce the immigration 
ruling, hoping to hasten a reso-
lution. 

The Clinton administration 
has adopted a dual approach. 
On one hand, officials want to 
show that their decision favor-
ing Elian's father is the product 
of established law that sets a pri-
ority on family, and they are 
willing to have it tested in feder-
al court. But the administration 
is also moving to end the stale-
mate quickly, pOSSibly seeking a 
court order that could have U.S. 
marshals' fetching Elian from 
Miami relatives. 

In her letter, Reno said that a 
separate lawsuit filed in Florida 
court by the relatives had no 
bearing on the case, which she 
said could be decided only in 
federal court. Judge Rosa 
Rodriguez of the Miami-Dade 
Circuit Court ruled Monday that 
Elian had to remain in the 
Untted States until a March 6 
hearing. 

Ms. Reno brushed aside that 
ruling, saying that the state 
court order had "no force or 
effect" on the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service's deci-
sion in the case. 

"The question of who may 
speak for a 6-year-old child in 
applying for admission or asy-
lum is a matter of federal immi-
gption law," Reno wrote. 
. Spencer Eig, a Miami lawyer 

who represents the Florida rela-
tives, said the family would 
soon take up Reno's invitation to 
file a challenge to the immigra-
tion service ruling in federa l 
court. 

-But Eig said the relatives 
would also maintain their efforts 
to have a state court award them 
legal custody of Elian.

THE SILVER SCREEN

Next Friday 
"... .. : Craig (Cube) moves from the inner 
city to the suburbs to live with his lottery-win-
ning uncle and cousins but quickly discovers 
that trouble can find you no matter where YOLl

test his survival skills and his commitment to 
family. 
F •• url ... : Ice Cube, John Witherspoon, 
Tamala Jones, Tom "Tiny" Lister Jr. and Mike 
Epps. 
Outlook: It's just not right to do a sequel to 
"Friday" without Smokey, but fans of the ori~­
inal will no doubt rush to theaters to see Craig 
and Deebo duel it out in the suburbs. Epps has 
big shoes to fill and it will be interesting to see 
how well he pulls off the comedic sidekick role.

Supernova 
"... .. : On the edges of deep space, a sort of 
space ambulance ship dubbed the Nightingale 
9 receives an S.O.S. from a mining crew on the

finds only one survivor and a strange alien arti-
fact. 
F •• urlne: James Spader, Angela Bassett, 
Robert Forster, Lou Diamond Phillips, Robin 
Tunney and Vincent D'Onofiro. 
OUtlook: One of this movie's tag Hnes refutes 
the classic sci-fi tagline: "In space no one can. 
hear you scream." People will no doubt be 
screaming for refunds once this abomination 
hits the box office. We can only hope that our 
cries do more than fall on Hollywood's deaf 
ears.

Pr ....... : Susanna Kaysen (Ryder), like many 
American teenagers of the 196Os, is struggling 
to make sense of the rapidly changing world 
around her. Her psychiatrist labels her confu-
sion and insecurity as Borderline Personality 
Disorder and Susanna is moved to Ciaymoore, 
a psychiatric hospital. Susanna is forced to 
choose between the safe Qut dry world of Clay-
moore and its patients and the often difficult 
outside world. 

. F •• urlne: Winona Ryder, Angelina Jolie, 
Whoopi Goldberg and Jared Leto. 
OUtlook: The feel on this picture is borderline. 
On the one hand, Ryder and Jolie are both fan-
tastic actresses. However, if the story can't back 
up their performances, there won't be enough 
to make this film worthwhile.

The Museum of Contemporary Art in Downtown

Senior Staff *'iter 

Marcel Duchamp revolutionized the 
modem art world when he placed every-
day objects, for which he coined the term 
"Readymades," within the context of a 
museum. The contemporary French artist 
Bertrand Lavier follows in Duchampian 
tradition, but with a reverse twist for the 
exhibit Bertrand Lavier: Walt Disney Pro-
ductions, currently on display at the 
Museum of Contemporary Art in Down-
town San Diego. 

Lavier engages the viewer in the inher-
ent irony of a 1947 comic strip entitled 
Very Abstract Lines in which Mickey and 
Minnie Mouse assume the roles as both 
subjects and critics of modem art. 

The French artist recreated a fantasy 
museum based upon the original cartoon, 
complete with plastic sculptures and 
abstract- images. 

The result is a sophisticated and syn-
thetic experience of art imitating, imitat-
ing reality.

All-Star Cast Cant Save Dying 'Magnolia' 
Tom Cruise, William H Macy, Julianne Moore and Philip Seymour Hoffman play poorly crafted characters 
By DAVID YEN 
Senior Staff Writer 

Don't buy into the hype. Paul 
Thomas Anderson's "Magnolia" 
is quite possibly one of the worst 
films you will ever see. Certainly, 
you would think, a film featuring 
such marquee stars as Tom 
Cruise, William H. Macy and 
Julianne Moore and directed by 
the man who helmed "Boogie 

ights" can't be horrible. Unfor-
tunately, it's worse. "Magnolia" is 
a three-hour movie featuring 
senseless ubplots, tortuous dia-
logue, ridiculous characters and 
soap opera-style melod rama. 

"Magnolia," like one of the 
year's best films, "American 
Beauty," challenges you to look 
closer. 11 presents a eries of seem-
ingly ordinary scenarios and asks 
the audience to find some greater 
meaning or connection among 
the cha racters and even ts. U nfor-
tunately, this IS just a hoax. When 
you arrive at the end of the film, 
there are no revelations, no feel-
lOgS of redemption and even no 
surprises (a la "The Sixth Sense"). 
Instead, there is the dreaded feel-
ing that you have just forfeited 
three hours of your life at the 
expense of a director who finds it 
amusing to wreck a talented cast 
slowly - and I mean slowly. 

In "American Beauty," you 
learn that despite all of life's 
hardships, there is still something 
beautiful about being alive. In 
"Magnolia," you learn that life 
sucks and people usually end up 
doing the things they are sup-
posed to do. You don't need a 

movie to tell you that. 
There are at least four or five 

different stories going on simulta-
neously in "Magnolia" (Honestly, 
I lost count). There is the story 
about a dying patriarch Oason 
Robards), attended to by his loyal 
nurse (Philip Seymour Hoffman) 
and his young wife Oulianne 
Moore), who only married him for 
'his money. The patriarch's long-
lost son is a dynamiC, male-cen-
tered sex guru (Tom Cruise), who 
gives long, impassioned speeches 
about how women are evi l. Then 
there is a young quiz show genius 
with a bladder problem, an older 
former quiz show champion who 
thinks he's stupid (Wi lliam H. 
Macy) and an even older quiz 
show host with cancer. Then 
there's his daughter - the crazy 
drug addict - and the simple-
minded cop who is supposed to be 
the moral center of the film. 

While a 11 of the characters 
exhibit intriguing personal traits, 
none of them appears often 
enough or engage in any actions 
\0 endear themselves to the audi-
ence. The consequences for each 
character, as well, are painfully 
predictable. As the soon-to-be 
widow, Moore tries and acts hys-
terical a lot. Cruise's character, 
believe It or not, ends up crying 
on his estranged father's 
deathbed. The cop, who is sup-
posed to appear profound despite 
an aura of simplicity, is really 
quite shallow. He gives an "elo-
quent" speech about how people 
sometimes need help and need to 
be forgiven . But if he is to be the 
one character who is deC'ent and

InteMIty. Cruise 's work in "Magnolia" earned him a Golden Globe nomination; however, Jason Robards 
delivers the film 's onty satisfactory performance as the eldery dying father. 

holds things together, how do 
you explain the fact that he puts 
his desire for a relationship over 
his duties as an officer? 

"Magnolia" garnered a lot of 
hype due to the addition of Tom 
Cruise as a supporting actor (he 

~eived a Golden Globe nomina-
tion). Pretty boy did not give a bad 
performance, mind you, but it was 
the character, not Cruise, that 

made the difference. If there was a 
decent performance in this mock-
ery of a flm, it would be Robards. 
All his character had to do was 
moan and groan every 30 seconds 
and then die at the end. Well done. 

The final hour of "Magnolia" 
tops off the insanity with a 10-
minute downpour. (Hint: it's not 
water falling from the sky.) This 
scene does successfully manage 

to shock the audience, but possi-
bly only because it makes no 
sense whatsoever. It gives the 
feeling that the producers are 
sharing an inside joke amongst 
themselves. Since expectations 
going in were so high, maybe 
they could throw in some awful 
scenes and have people scramble

MOVIES: 
Various dramas 
dominate season 
eonu.ued from ..... 12 
.make for interesting filmmaking 
If the cast and director really get 
inside the story and explore its 
strangeness to its fullest extent. 

fmmm ~l~ 
Gun Shy 
......... : Charlie Mayo (Neeson) 
is an undercover DEA agent on his 
last assignment to bring down a 
known Mafia hit man. Unfortu-
nately, his business and personal 
lives are full of stress. Therapy and 
medication don' t seem to help, but 
when Charlie tries massage he 
meets the girl of his dreams. 
FeIItIIIIIC: Liam Neeson, Oliver 
Platt and Sandra Bullock. 
0utI00Ic Think "Analyze This" 
but from the other side of the law 
- Flus a love interest. This film 
wil probably tum out to be a run-
of-the-mill romantic comedy. 

Scream 3 
" .. 1 .. : Sydney Prescott 's 
(Cox) ordeal comes full circle in 
the third installment of the 
"Scream" trilogy. Prescott has 
moved to Hollywood to become 
an actress but when peor-Ie start 
dying, around the set of ' Stab 3," 
Sydney realizes that the final act 
of her scary . movie must take 
place where it began, in Woods-
boro. 
Featurl-,: Neve Campbell, 
Courteney Cox, David Arquette, 
Patrick Dempsey, Scott Foley, 
Lance Henriksen, Jenny 
McCarthy, Parker Posey, Carrie 

Fisher and Liev Schreiber. 
Outlook: There are some 
extremely positive reviews float-
ing around by people who have 
seen advanced screenings of the 
film. Hopefully the rumors will 
be true and "Scream" will return 
to its roots rather than attempt to 
be just another cheesy, modem, 
horror flick. 

ffBRUARY llT~ 
The Beach 
" ...... : Three youths in search 
of a truly unique life experience 
discover a completely unspoiled 
island/aradise. Their dreams are 
spoile by the introduction of an 
evil element to the island, forcing 
them to fight for their home and 
their lives. 
Featurlne Leonardo DiCaprio, 
Tilda Swinton and director 
Danny Boyle. 
Outlook: For those woo don't 
know, Danny Boyle directed 
"Shallow Grave" and "Trainspot-
ting." which are two extremely 
well-done films. On top' of his 
foundation, solid acting perfor-
mances are guaranteed by 
DiCaprio and Swinton. 

_Hanging Up 
PreIaIu: This comedy follows a 
trio of sisters who bond over their 
ambivalence toward the 
approaching death of their cur-

The UCSD Guardian 

mudgeonly father (Matthau), to 
whom none of them was particu-
larly close. 
FeMurlne: Lisa Kudrow, Meg 
Ryan, Walter Matthau and 
actor/director Diane Keaton. 
outIooIc Think this year's 'The 
First Wives Club" but swap the 
two crummy actresses for Kudrow 
and Ryan. This trio promises to be 
far mQre captivating than the crew 
from 1996, but whether or not this 
film will actually reach its audi-
ences remains to be seen. 

ffB~M~Y 1 ~lH 
The Whole Nine 
Yards 
Pr ...... : Nick Oza ransky's 
(Perry) life is turned upside down 
by the arrival of his new neigh-
bor, a hit man named Jimmy the 
Tulip Tedeschi (Willis). 
F • .turln,: Bruce Willis, 
Matthew Perry, Rosanna 
Arquette, Natasha Henstridge 
and Kevin Pollak. 
outlook: The trailer for "The 
Whole Nine Yards" confirms that 
Willis and Perry are a perfect 
match in this screwball comedy 
about a typical suburbanite wlm 
can't deal with the fact that his 
neighbor happens to have killed 
dozens of people. 

Pitch Black 
Pr •• I .. : When a spaceship 
crashes on a seemingly lifeless, 
su n-scorched world, the sur-
vivors and one escaped prisoner 
must face the horrifying crea-
tures which only come out in the 
dark. 

this year's "Supernova" and 
countless shameless sci-fi horror 
flicks of years' past comes "Pitch 
Black." Think "Tremors" but only 
at night. <Shudder.> 

The Skulls 
........... : Luke McNamara, a col-
lege senior from a working class 
background, joins a secret elitist 
college fraternity organization 
called "The Skulls" in hope of 
gaining acceptance into Harvard 
Law School. When his best friend 
commits suicide, Luke begins to 
realize the disturbing nature of 
the organization. 

F~ Joshua Jackson 
Outlook: Jackson ditches the 
Creek and heads back to the sil-
ver screen (he's come a long way 
from "The Mighty Ducks 3" in 
1996) for this disturbingly creepy 
look at college fraterni ties. 

Deterrence 
Pr ....... : The president of the 
United States (Pollack) must deal 
with an international military 
crisis while confined to a Col-
orado diner during a freak snow-
storm. 
F..turllC: Kevin Pollack, Timo-
thy Hutton, Sheryl Lee Ralph and 
Sean Astin. 
Outlook: Sort of a neat premise 
but it remains doubtful whether 
or not it will ustain an audi-
ence' attention for more than 90 
minutes.

successful first novel. In the 
course of the film, his student 
(Holmes) develops a crush on the 
academic. He, however, gets the 
chancellor (McDormand) preg-
nant and teams up with another 
student to find a rare jacket once 
owned by Marilyn Monroe. 
F •• urln,: Michael Douglas, 
Robert Downey Jr., Katie Holmes, 
Frances McDormand and Rip 
Torn. 
Outlook: These talented actors 
will explore a complex array of 
interpersonal relationships, how-
ever it's difficult to tell whether 
the crew will approach these 
subjects from a comedic or dra-
matic angle. In any case, it 's 
worth ta king a look a t if only for 
the cast. 

Foolproof 
Pr ...... : "Foolproof" is a deli-
ciously mean-spirited comedy 
about the chaos that ensues 
when an ' overworked and 
underappreciated chauffeur for 
a nasty dowager teams up with 
his hot dog-selling buddy to kid-
nap the old bag's pampered 
pooch. 
F •• urln.: David Chappelle, 
Danny DeVito and Maria Arce. 
Outlook: A goofy premise how-
ever it stands alone as the sole 
"dog" film of the season so one 
can never tell . It's doubtful 
whether or not this flick will 
stand out. Fellturlne: Vin Diesel, Radha Pr ..... : A thrice-wed college

MOVIES: 
Shakespearean remakes 
and silly spoofs 
ContInued froIn ..... 13 

MARL~ J~~ 
What Planet Are 
You From? 
Pr'-": In this comedy, an alien 
(Shandling) is assigned to visit 
Earth in order to breed. Yes, 
breed. However, his alien sex 
organs aren't quite compatible 
with a human's and thus he finds 
it necessary to be creative. FutIIrI. Garry Shandling, 
Annette Bening, John Goodman, 
Greg Kinnear, Ben Kingsley, 
Linda Fiorentino and Nora Dunn. 
outlook: The premise is bizarre, 
but the cast is an accomplished 
collection of actor/comedians, so 
the product may be quite good. 

Chain of Fools 
Pr •• I .. : An avid detective 
(Hayek) is assigned to investigate 
the heist of a batch of precious 
coins that end up in the hands of 
a suicidal barber (Zahn). The bar-
ber subsequently falls in love 
with the detective. 
F.eturtq: Salma Hayek, Jeff 
Goldblum, Lara Flynn Boyle, 
David Cross and Steve Zahn. 
ChrtIook: A heavy contender for 
this weekend's comedic overload. 
Another solid cast of comedians 
and amusing plots will be a tough , 
match for the other films. 

MML~ l~lH 
Mission to Mars 
Pr •• I •• : The first NASA mission 
to Mars goes awry leaving all but 
one (Cheadle) of the crew mem-
bers dead . Another group of 
astronauts (led by Sinise) are sent 
in to rescue him, explore the plan-
et and find out what went wrong. 
, ..... rt-c: Don Cheadle, Kim 
Delaney, Jerry O'Connell, Tim 
Robbins, Gary Sinise and director 
Brian De Palma. 
CIutIooIc The trailer for "Mission 
to Mars" makes the film look 
more epic than the other sci-Ii 
offerings available this season. 
However, De Palma still hasn't 
cured the damage inflicted by 
"Snake Eyes." 

o 
" ..... : The story of Othello 
retold on the basketball courts of a 
high school. The story centers on 
the young Odin (Phifer) - who is 
convinced by his conniving best 
friend Hugo (Hartnett) that his 
girlfriend is cheating on him. 
, .... rtq: Mekhi Phifer, Josh 
Hartnett and Julia Stiles. 
Outlook: The next in a long line of 
Shakespearean remakes sets Oth-
ello in a high school? Could work. 
Phifer is an extremely talented 
actor but it's unclear whether or 
not the rage of Othello will trans-
la te well in to this version. 

MAGNOLIA: 
Movie falls apart on 
every single level 
Cowll •• d froIII ..... 12 
to figure out the symbolism (there 
is none). Or maybe, they figured, 
since so many , Hollywood films 
nowadays are conventional, for-
mula-driven dramas or action 
shoot-em ups, then anything 
wacky or different would be 
embraced by movie-goers. Quali-
ty, after all, is only an illusion. 

MML~ ~~lH 
Romeo Must Die 
PreMI .. : A retelling of Romeo 
and Juliet with modern roles. Set 
in Oakland, Calif. as a truce 
between African American and 
Asian gangs falls apart, two pe0-
ple (Li and Haughton) from 
opposite sides of the feud find 
themselves falling in love. Natu-
rally the match is not preferred by 
either side and violence ensues. 
FubIrIItC: Jet Li, Aaliyah 
Haughton, Isaiah Washington 
and Delroy Lindo. 
acllulc It's been way too long 
since "Lethal Weapon 4" intro-
duced Jet Li to American audi-
ences and this will be his first 
return to the big screen since. 

MML~ ~~lH 
The Road to EI 
Dorado 
" .... ee: Two swindlers (Branagh 
and Klein) get their hands on a 
map to the fabled city of gold, EI 
Dorado. The two stow themselves 
on board one of Cortez's ships and 
travel to the New World, eventual-
ly finding the city. Once there, they 
are used by a priest (Assante) 
who's trying to win control of the 
city for himself. 
F..e.tnc: The voices of Armand 
Assante, Kenneth Branagh, Kevin 
Kline, Edward James Olmos and 
Rosie Perez. 
Outlook: A fun animated film 
that probably won't touch at all 
on the terrible crimes inflicted on 
the Native Americans by the 
Spanish. 

The Ninth Gate 
Pr •• I .. : A rare book dealer 
(Depp) seeks out the last two 
copies of a demon text that are 
said to have the power of sum-
moning Satan. His venture draws 
him into the middle of conspiracy 
with supernatural overtones. 
F...e.tIIC: Johnny Depp, Frank 
Langella, Lena Olin, Emmanuelle 
Seigner and director Roman 
Polanski. 
outlook: If audiences can ever 
forgive Hollywood for "End of 
Days," then this film might be 
well received. However, it's 
unlikely that even Depp's talents 
will win an audience for another 
Satan-summoning flick. 

Scary Movie 
.... 1111 •• : This spoof of the popular 
s1asher flicks: "Scream," "I Know 
What You Did Last Summer," 
MHalioween" and "Friday the 
13th" was originally titled "Last 
Summer I Screamed Because Hal-
loween fell On Friday the 13th." 
,......... Carmen Electra, 
Shannon Elizabeth, Cheri Oteri 
Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans 
and actor/director Keenen Ivory 

~:: • Think "Don't Be a Men-
ace to South Central While Drink-
ing Your Juice in the Hood" but 
with the s;:>oof on the horror genre. 

"Magnolia" is a film to see 
simply for the fact that it illus-
trates everything you should 
avoid in making a film. In gener-
al, a movie is something that 
attempts to get the viewer to like 
a character or many characters in 
the span of two hours as they 
strive to overcome a series of 
obstacles. What do you call some-
thing that tries to get you to like 
10 characters who end up right 
where they started after three 
hours? Someone should tell P.T. 
Anderson he had better stick to 
pom stars.

with the Raiders and who thinks

The Vikings can win if 
Robert Smith plays like he 
played against Dallas last week, 
rushing for 140 yards on 28 car-
ries. If he can do that again and 
George and his troika of pass 
catchers are clicking, the Rams 
may have bitten off more than 
they can chew. 

The Rams have two addi-
tional advantages that the 
Vikings don't, however. First, 

The UCSD Guardian 

they are playing at home in the 
very loud Trans World Dome, 
which is hosting its first ever 
playoff game and is expected to 
be rowdy. Also, the Rams have 
Head Coach Dick Vermeil a t the 
helm. Vermeil has Super Bowl 
experience, having lost tJ,e big 
one in 1980 to the Oakland 
Raiders. He knows how to pre-
pare his team for a big game. 

Don't get me wrong, the 
Vikings will score, but the dif-
ference In defenses will allow 
the Rams to score much more.

Reality 
Check 
By Bill Bur • ., 

Who Should Be 
Number One 

For me, one of the most 
enjoyable things about 
approaching the year 2000 was 
reading all of the "best of" 
lists. I know that for most of 
you these anthologies of pe0-
ple, places and events got tire-
some, but I found them inter-
esting. 

Probably the best part of 
these lists is that not a single 
one could make it to comple-
tion without 95 percent of the 
people knowing about it being 
upset about the choices made. 
I definitely fall into this 95 per-
cent. 

Since this is a sports col-
umn, you've probably guessed 
that I am referring to ESP's 
list of the top 100 athletes of all 
time. 

The UCSD Guardian 

I have quite a few prob-
lems with this liSt. First, let 
me get this out of the way. 
ESPN put Secretariat, general-
ly considered the best racing 
horse of all time, on the list. 
There is no wayan animal 
should be considered an ath-
lete. Horse racing is just a way 
for obsessive gamblers to get 
their fix in between sports 
bets and visits to the local 
Indian reservation: AFC: The DolpNns may have themselves 

Secretariat is a problem I 
can deal with. The problem I 
can't deal with, however, 
starts at the very top. 

I know Michael Jordan, 
ESPN's No. 1 athlete of the 
century, is generaJly consid-
ered a god. Granted, the guy 
did some incredible things and 
deserved to be very high on 
the list. Although Jordan 
seemed to defy the laws of 
gravity on many occasions, I 
don't see how anyone other 
than Jackie Robinson can be 
considered the greatest athlete 
of the 20th century. 

Robinson excelled at four 
sports at UCLA. When he 
chose baseball, generally con-
sidered to be his fourth or 
fifth best sport, he excelled at 
that too. He won two MVPs 
and helped the Dodgers 
break the curse that the 
Yankees put on them during 
the 10 years before 
Robinson's arrival. 

This alone makes Robinson 
a top athlete, but how he made 
it to the major leagues makes 
him the best athlete. 
Robinson's breaking of the 
athletic ethnicity barrier gave 
African Americans a new 
opportunity. If it wasn't for 
Robinson, Jordan would never 
have had a chance to show 
what he could do. This is why 
Robinson deserves to be rated 
as the best athlete of the 20th 
century. 

Rl,binson received death 
threa ts and experienced 
racism that few people alive 
today can fathom. Through it 
all , he took the opposition 
with a grain of salt and let his 
game speak for itself. His 
maturity and pure love for 
baseball should be a lesson to 
everyone. 

Robinson embodied what a 
great athlete should be and 
therefore deserves to be called 
the greatest. 

more time, but they are no match for the Jags, 
while the Colts' offensive trio will beat the Titans 
By BILL BURGER 
Sports Editor 

The AFC playoff picture 
includes four teams fiJdlting for 
a trip to the Super Bowl Here is 
the breakdown 

......... ". eon. ...... 
,.-..... ~ 

Tennessee 
finished its sea-

needed while receding back into 
mediocrity when it is not. 

That being said, I am still 
going to choose against the 
TItans this weekend. They just 
don't have the offensive firepow-
er to combat the Colts' magical 
trio of Peyton Manning, Edgerin 
James and Marvin Harrison . 
Moreover, the Colts are corning 

off a stinging 
loss to the Bills 

son with a 13-3 
record - the 
best in history 
for a wild card 
team. They will 
be facing off 
against the 
upstart 
Indianapolis 

AFC at the end of the regular sea-son and will likely be very ready for this 
game a~ they 
are commg off 
a bye week. 

GUARDIAN SPORTS 

Colts, who also finished the reg-
ular season 13-3 and won the 
AFC East, which was the best 
division in football this year. 

Truthfully, however, the 
TItans should probably be sitting 
at horne watching this week-
end's game instead of playing in 
it. If it weren't for a blown call by 
referee Phil Luckett at the end of 
the TItans' game with Buffalo 
that allowed the TItans to return 
the game's last kickoff for a 
touchdown as time expired, 
Buffalo would be playing in this 
game. However, the Titans defi-
nitely do seem to have what it 
takes to ante up to the table 
when they need to and get the 
job done. 

The TItans have found ways 
to win all season. They are 3-0 
against the Jaguars and the Rams 
this season, whereas all other 
teams .s;Qmbined were a meager 
2-26 against the league's jugger-
naut tearns. This should prove 
that the TItans can play in a big 
game. Also, quarterback Steve 
McNair seems to be able to pull 
off a big performance when it is

prediction: Colts 28, TItans 17.

If it weren't for two things, 

this would be the most lopsided 
second round playoff match of 
all time. The Jaguars own the 
best record in the league and 
have looked like a well-oiled 
machine almost every week. So 
what makes this game even 
watchable? 

First of all, this is likely to be 
Dan Marino's last game, and he 
doesn't want to go down with-
out a fight. Second, the Jaguars 
are hurting badly. All-world 
offensive lineman Tony 8osse1li 
is out for the season and star 
quarterback Mark Brunell is also 
suffering injuries and he might 
not play. Quite honestly, I don't 
think it will matter if Brunell 
plays or not. I could probably get 
out there and be the QB for the 
Jaguars this weekend and score 
enouah points to win the game.

24, Dolphins 7.

NFC: Washington's wounded running game 
cannot withstand the Bucs'defense, and it should 
be an air war in St. Louis with the VIkings losing 
By ROBERT FUlTON 
Staff Writer 

Now that the preliminary 
round of the NFL playoffs is 
over, the real teams can now 
come out and demonstrate their 
talents. This is where things get 
intereSting. 

W.III' ............ va. 
~.., .. aa_ .. ... 

The first matchup in the next 
round comes on Saturday when 
the Washington Redskins (the 
East Division champion) wiJI 
travel to Tampa Bay, Fla. to face 
the Central Division winner, the 
Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 

Although the Redskins 
earned this matchup with a vic-
tory over the Lions, they did not 
do so unscathed. 

Washington has two major 
injuries that will be its undoing. 

Starting running back 
Stephen Davis' is doubtful due 
to a knee injury he sustained 
against the 
L ion s . 

to fullback Mike Alstott or run-
ning back Warrick Dunn and 
wear out a questionable Redskin 
defense. 

The playoffs are no place for a 
rookie quarterback, but the Bues' 
Shaun King has shown poise the 
last few weeks of the season in 
place of injured starting QB Trent 
Dilfer. Plus, as long as Alstott 
and Dunn are their usual selves, 
King shouldn't be forced into too 
many unnecessary passing situa-
tions. 

The Bues are a good team that 
won a tough division that 
included the 11-7 Vikings, the 
playoff-bound Lions and the 
always dangerous Brett Favre-
lead Packers. 

With Tampa Bay's Raymond 
James Stadium roCking in sup-
port of their beloved team, the 
Buccaneers should have no prob-
lem in advancing to the NFC 
championship game. 

Guard"," prediction: 
Buccaneers 23, Redskins 13.

On the other 
side of the NFC 
playoff picture 
are two of the 
highest flying 
tearns around as 

Davis is the 
most impor-
tant player on 
the Redskins. 

GU.tlR nlA N SPORTS 

In last week's game against 
Detroit, he rumbled for 119 yards 
and two touchdowns in the first 
half alone. He also led the NFL in 
rushing this season. Now, with 
this key player sitting on the 
sidelihes, Washington's respon-
sibilities faU on the shoulders bf 
quarterback Brad John$on. 

Johnson is a decent enough 
QB, but without Davis there to 
run the ball, and with a depleted 
line in front of him, it should be a 
long day for the Redskin quar-
tert:iack as he faces a devastating 
Tampa Bay defense. , 

The Redskins played in' a 
weak division that sported the 8-
8 Cowboys as the second best 
team and then faced a weak first-
round opponent. Thus, there is 
reason to question their abilities. 

The Bues' D, led by Warren 
Sapp, is ont' of the best in the 
league. With very capable talent 
allover the defensive side of the 
ball, Tampa Bay should have no 
problem controlling a weakened 
kedsldn offensive. 

The Sues' offenslVejlans are 
relatively Simple. Han the ba)) 

the St. Louis 
Rams play host to the Minnesota 
Vikings. 

Both teams feature a number 
of offensive highlight machines. 
The Rams sport league MVP 
Kurt Warner tossing balls to 
Isaac· Bruce while running back 
Marshall Faulk can do almost 
anything coming out of the back 
field. 

The Vikings have rocket arm 
QB Jeff George at the helm, pass-
ing to two of the best receivers in 
football: Cris Carter and Randy 
Moss. With Jake Reed taking the 
third ret:eiver position and 
Robert Smith staying healthy 
and proving his worth in the 
backfield, the Vikings are very 
scary when they have the ball. 

However, the Vikings have a 
suspect defense, and when a 
team is plaring the offensive jug-
gernaut 0 the Rams, a goOd 
aefense would have trouble, let 
alone a weak one. 

Plus, their quarterback is Jeff 
George. George has a hell of an 
arm, but he has always been a
