Wallerstein, who lectured at 
UC Berkeley's School of

entitled The Good Marriage: 
How and Why Love Lasts. The 
book divides marriages into 
one of four categories: 
"romantic," "rescue," "com-
passionate" and "traditional." 
After conducting interviews 
with 50 happily married 
couples in the San Francisco 
Bay area, Wallerstein said that 
there are nine characteristics 
leading to a successful 
marriage. "It's not a 'how-to'

making a happy marriage in a 
culture of divorce."

Wilson Axes Affirmative Action 
ORDER: Governor 
urges UC, CSU, CC 
systems to follow suit 
By Jonna P"mer 
Senior Staff Writer 

Amid political controversy over 
affirmative action, Gov. Pete Wil-
son signed an executive order last 
Thursday to end preferential pro-
grams based on race and gender. 

The order comes on the heels of 
debate over affirmative action in the 
UC system and, although Wilson 

has no direct authority over UC, 
CSU and community college affir-
mative-action programs, he specifi-
cally called for all the three systems 
of higher education to comply with 
his measure. 

According to section eight of the 
executive order, " ... the University 
of California, the California State 
University, the California Commu-
nity Colleges... and commissions 
not directly under the authority of 
the executive branch are requested 
to take all necessary action to com-
ply with the intent and the require-

DANCING 'I'lL DAWN 

ments of this executive order." 
University of California Student 

Association (UCSA) Policy Ana-
lyst Peter Pursley said the order was 
limited in scope, and the governor 
did not have the power to affect the 
course of affirmative-action discus-
sion at the UC level. 

"He only has one voice on the 
Board of Regents," said Pursley. "I 
haven't seen him there all year." 

According to Pursley, Wilson's 
order is problematic for two rea-
sons. Most importantly, the order 
only applies to entities such as the 

Departments of Transportation and 
Forestry, which fall directly under 
the executive branch. 

In addition, Pursley said the 
governor's order could not affect 
the preferential treatment extended 
to veterans and people with dis-
abilities. 

In a June 1 letter to UC Board of 
Regents Chairman Howard Leach, 
Wilson emphasized the need to end 
"race and gender-based special pref-
erences programs."

A.S. Subsidizes 
Alcohol for Next 
Year'sTGs 
PORTER'S: Campus pub will 
serve as the venue next year, 
replacing the Price Center 
By Nina Bou&hton 
StBffWriter 

Due in part to efforts made by Associated Students 
(A.S.) Commissioner of Programming Kevin Moo, 
alcohol will once again be served at TGIFs (TGs) next 
year. The TGs will be held at Porter's Pub on alternat-
ing Fridays. The Pub was selected because Moo found 
a loophole in the administration's dry-campus policy 
and a way to comply with the Alcohol Beverage 
Control's (ABC) rules. 

"Porter's is zoned [for alcohol consumption)," said 
Moo. "The owner of Porter's Pub has to sell in 
pints ... within his costs [and) within the confines of 
the law. It will cost 50 cents a pint for quality alcohol. 
Soft drinks and water will be free." 

Moo added that Porter's Pub will be a good site for 
TGs, even though space is limited to 780 people. 

"We were trying to move away from the Price 
Center," said Moo. "It's a bad concert venue and 
wasn't built for a stage or for more than 100 people. 

"[But) Porter's is a great concert venue. It's in-
doors and has less of a liability issue," he added.

According to A.S. President Naomi Falk, the ad-

long as we're complying with ABC regulations," said 
Falk. "Underage drinking was a concern with former

Chancellor Addresses Staft'Association On Issues Facing UCs 
IRIERNG: Atkinson 
focuses on funding, 
affirmative action 
By Terry Lew 
Staff Writer 

In an informal presentation be-
fore more than 60 members of the 
UCSD Staff Association last 
Wednesday, Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson spoke about topics rang-
ing from potential cuts in federal 
funding to the impending review of 
affirmative-action policies, among 
other issues. 

"We need to realize that the fed-
eral government's funding picture 
is not very bright for the university 
in general," said Atkinson, citing 
the likelihood of a 25-percent re-
duction in federal research funding 
over the next five years. 

Despite his concern that any fund-
ing cuts would be "devastating" to 
the university, Atkinson remained 
optimistic. 

"[UCSD) has somehow managed 
to be more effective in the pursuit of 
those funds," he said. "We've never 
seen the drops that other universi-
ties have seen." 

"I'm very optimistic that no mat-
ter how the national economy goes, 
California has already seen the worst 
of its problems and is now turning 
around," he added. 

Vice Chancellor of Research Ri-
chard Attiyeh responded to 
Atkinson 's speech by saying that 
the future of federal funding ap-
pears bleak. 

"There is a lot of uncertainty as 
to what will happen," Attiyeh said. 
"The outlook is not good. Congress 
is basically committed to a balanced 
budget." 

According to Attiyeh, no deci-

sion has yet been made regarding 
which funding will be cut, but pre-
liminary indications of the reduc-
tions will appear in the 1995-96 
federal budget, expected this sum-
mer. 

"[The budget) will be the first 
hard evidence as to what the cuts 
will actually be," he said, adding 
that UCSD currently receives over 
$200 million in annual federal re-
search money from agencies such 
as the National Science Founda-
tion, the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) and the Departments of De-

SPEECH: 
Chancellor addresses 
affirmative action 
Continued from pee- 1 
fense and Energy. 

Despite these contributions, 
many of those who rely on grant 
money say that federal funding is 
not sufficient. 

"Nine out of 10 times, you won't 
get the amount you asked for," said 
UCSD Cancer Center Principal 
Invesligator (PI) Gerrit Los. 

Los also said that a project's 
chances of getting an NIH grant 
currently range from 10 to 15 per-
cent, but that less money available 
would mean increased competi-
tion for fewer grants. 

"It's hard now, but it will get 
harder and harder," he said. 

Scripps PI Miriam Kastner ech-
oed Los' concern over the increas-
ing difficulty of obtaining grants, 
saying that the long-term conse-
quences of funding reductions 

would be disastrous. 
"We won't sec the damage im-

mediately, but it will accumulate," 
she added. "We won't be able to 
support top-notch students. It won't 
affect our research, but a future 
generation of scientists - a chain 
reaction that'll take two to three 
generations from which to recover. ~ 

Addressing another issue fac-
ing today's students, Atkinson 
spoke briefly in defenseofaffirma-
tive action. "To walk away from 
[it] would be detrimenlal in the 
extreme," he said. 

"The matter was raised some 
six months ago at a regents meet-
ing," Atkinson said, "and the deci-
sion was made by the regents to 
begin a review of affirmative-ac-
tion programs in the university." 

Atkinson also said that the re-
gents have reviewed different affir-
mative-action programs each month, 
starting with medical school admis-
sions policies, and ending last month 
with a review of undergraduate and 
law school admissions policies. 

The UCSD Guardian 

"There is talk about the possi-
bility of the regents focusing on 
some type of resolution at the June 
meeting," he continued, "[but] I 
have no idea where the votes stand. 
I do not think the regents are going 
to take a preemptive action in this 
situation. I think the matter will be 
put aside for some period." 

Atkinson also lalked about the 
search for the next UC president, 
saying that despite current delays, 
he is cerlain that a decision will be 
made by the end of June. 

Atkinson concluded his speech 
by warning that the state will likely 
take money from the existing UCS 
to buildthe 10th campus in Merced. 

"One of the problems for [the 
university]," he said, "is that if 
they begin to build that campus, 
large resources are going to be taken 
from the UC system to do it. 

"Whether the slate can come 
forth with enough resources to do 
that without impinging on other 
campuses is very doubtful at this 
point," he added.

Polo-clad white fI'Uljority, which fI'Ul!ces a sport 
out of cornering and bealing lone non-white 
students. Blatant racism is everywhere: Old 
fountains labeled "colored" spout befouled, 
brackish water and stand in stark contrast to 
the "white" fountains, which stream refrig-
erated Evian. Separate telephone registration 
lines for whites ensure that the choice classes 
are offered first to Anglo students. In the 
shadows, the minority student navigates in 
fear, skirting meetings held by the leather-
decked members of the Kappa Kappa 
Kappa (KKK) fraternity. 

This is the impression I got about the 
." general state of this school upon listening 

~ to the rhetoric of the Cross-Cultural Coa-
....... lition last year when they clamored for a 

Cross-Cultural Center (CCC). The school, 
according to these students, was "hostile 

toward minorities" and not "sensitive to 
, their needs." 11 Sensitive to their needs? Are we talking about college students or rare tropical plants? Do minority students re-quire special watering, tending and 

(mind)mulching that presumably hardier 
Anglo stock do not require? 

A brief perusal of the 
programs offered by 
the Cross-Cultural 
Center confirms this 
suspicion. Aca-

demic advising, 
study groups, tutorial 

. services, mentor pro-
grams, volunteer/intern-
ship services and aea-
dem ie/professional 
speakers are among the 
tbings CCC boasts of in 
its pamphlet. 

Yet, nearly every ser-
vice offered by the CCC 
is a duplication of ser-

vices offered elsewhere on campus. Most of 
the programs specific to tbe CCC are just silly 
"ethnic celebrations," "resources regarding 
multiculturalism and diversity" and - my 
favorite - "support groups for students of 
color." As a "student of color," I'm insulted 

Cross Cultural Center Redux by the CCC's premise - that the tutorial ser-vices offered by OASIS, the opportunities 
offered by the Academic Intern Program and 
otber excellent resources are fine for white 
students, but are (ia some indeterminate way) 
inadequate to serve my "special needs."

When I was approached this week to write 
a commentary in support of the Cross-Cul-
tural Center (CCC), I was confused as to the 
purpose of such an exercise. Why now? The 
center is a reality on the UCSD campus, the 
product of many years of hard work and per-
severance on the part of students, staff and 
faculty of color. Why should anyone have to 
continue to defend the center? Why, at tbis 
late date, would anyone choose to argue 
against it? 

What opponents of the CCC do not real-
ize is that they have already lost. The debate 
about whether or not UCSD should have a 
center ended last year when Chancellor 
Atkinson gave his approval for the project. 
At our opening ceremonies on the evening 
of May 25, the chancellor expressed his re-
grets that such a center bad not been estab-
lished IOOner, since, according to him, there 
was all ufJCllt need for one It UCSD. Other 

institutions of higher learning had estab-
lished similar centers over 20 years ago. 
UCSD had finally entered the modem age 
with regard to issues of student diversity. 

During the last year, a variety of forums 
have articulated the reasons UCSD needs 

an impoverished social life. The Cross-Cul-
tural Center wu designed to be a small part 
of the solution to this malaise. As Rabbi Jay 
Miller told me at the opening ceremony: 
UCSD is ill, and the Cross-Cultural Center is 
part of the cure. 

such a center. From overt 
acts of racism on campus, to 
more subtle forms of insti-
tutional prejudice, to declin-
ing enrollments of Latino 
students and to the 
underrepresentation of Afri-
can Americans, one can cata-
logue the very real problems 
which confront this campus.

Opponents argue that the

~ laughable objection - an 
example of inverted logic

and it is a wonder that any student or em-
ployee would look forward to spending long 
periods of time on campus. Factor in the hos-
tility among various ethnic groups, aDd you 
have a recipe for educatioaal mediocrity ud 

"It is the center's highest pri-
ority to facilitate the academic success and 
personal development of those students who 
are members of historically underrepresented 
groups. The CCC will also provide a network 
of services and programs for the whole cam-
pus in an effort to foster the diSCllSSion of 
isIuea related to the creatioa of a multi-eth-

The notion that skin color makes someone 
a fundamentally different kind of human be-
ing is racist. While UC officals make the 
proper "our doors are open to all" noises, the 
agenda of the CCC orpnizers is clear: "CCC 
offers meeting, office and work space for stu-
dents, faculty and staff of color· (italics mine). 
Reversing the placement of the "colored only" 
and the "white only" signs - whetber on 
water fountains or on campus services - does 
nothing to combat racism, but instead inforces 
the destructive ethnic balkanization which 
leads to "us-againat-them" racial tensions. 

The accusation tbat this university is "hos-
tile toward minorities" is even more ques-
tionable. It is ludicrous to accuse a school, 
whose white population is 51 percent of the 
entire student head-count, of being "hostile" 
toward non-white students. The need for the 
CCC hinges on the premise that we are liv-
ing in an fundamentally racist campus where 
minorities need to be sheltered. Witnessing a

Monday, June 5, 1995 The UCSD Guardian OPINION .5 

IF A.S. WON'T SUPPORT UCSA, ROOSEVELT STUDENT COUNCIL WILL 
Editor: 

During the past few weeks, 
ASUCSD has deliberated on the 
budget for the 1995-96 school year. 
One point of contention was the 
ASUCSD's continued funding of 
University of California Student 
Association (UCSA) at $1.50 per 
student per year. A.S. President 
Naomi" Falk did not raise the annual 
contribution to UCSA, but let pre-
cedent set it for her. The majority 
of the council felt that UCSD made 
too much of a contribution to UCSA 
and therefore lowered the contribu-
tion to $1.25. 

These events caused many de-
bates within the ranks of the AS. 
However, democracy won out, and 
I, for one, cannot gainsay the pro-
cess. I will no longer contend 
against this tide which has swept 
foresight and long-term planning 
away and left in its shoals, self-
gratificatiQn and self-indulgence. 

I am happy to note that over 500 
students signed a petition in support 
of the continued funding of UCSA 
at $1.50. lam even more heartened 
to find that three college councils 
also support full funding. 

The Student Council of Eleanor 
Roosevelt College (SCERC) has 
supported full funding since these 
discussions began. During the June 
1 meeting, SCERC debated the fi-
nal decision of ASUCSD concern-
ing UCSA The council vehemently 
disagreed with the decision, finding 
that it lacked sound judgment. 

Knowing that most legal propos-
als to fully fund UCSA will meet 
defeat in AS., SCERC has decided 
to contribute $200 to UCSA in 

hopes that other college councils 
will do the same. We realize that this 
contribution is a very small token 
compared to what was cut by the 
A.S., but if other colleges follow 
suit, then the total contribution has 
the potential of becoming $1000. 

In the words of Eleanor 
Roosevelt, "I would rather light a 
candle than curse the darkness." 

UCSA is a candle lit many years 
ago. SCERC will always endeavor 
to keep it lit.

Editor: 

Speaking as an A.S. member, 
who came to A.S. thinking that the 
council was there for the students, I 
am disheartened to say, "What a 
joke!" 

At last week'~meeting, the coun-
cil just moaned about how we have 
limited funds this year, how we're 
on a tight budget, etc ... That's why 
A.S. voted to slash UCSA funding 
from $1.50 per student to $1.25 per 
student. Now, that would be ratio-
nal if we were actually on a tight 
budget. But the fact is, we're not. 
This year's budget is filled with a 
lot of pork, pet projects or whatever 
you like to call it - including $6000 
for tailgate parties. Yes, tailgate par-
ties! 

As Brent Johnson said in his 
commentary last Thursday ("A.S. 
Shoots Itself in the Foot Again," 
June 1), it seems that theA.S. would

rather fund tailgate parties than tight 
the regents and their fee hikes. 
Sometimes, I wonder if the A.S. is 
just filled with a bunch of rich kids 
who have never even heard of a 
Stafford Loan. 

But don't get me wrong, having 
tailgate parties to boost school spirit 
is a 0001 idea, j ust not at the expense 
of the UCSA, our only fighting 
voice against the regents and their 
fee hikes. 

And another thing: If any orga-
nization or event wants to get 
money from A.S., it bas to submit a 
written proposal that includes some 
research into the event and a spe-
cifIC budget; the tailgaters had noth-
ing. They just came to A.S., asked, 
"a.n we have tailgate parties?" and 

A.S., being a pushover, said, "OK!" 
Attention all clubs: Do you need 
money for a kegger, a pot party or 
any other useless event? Just come 
down to a council meeting and more 
than likely, you'll get your money. 
We meet every Wednesday at 6:30 
p.m. on the third floor of the Price 
Center. I'll see you there!

OASIS aecomes 
Another VIctIm of Cuts 
EdItor: 

I am writing to inform the cam-
pus community of yet anotber ca-
sualty of this era of budget cuts. The 
OASIS Writing Center was closed 
as of 2 p.m., Friday, May 12. In an 
11 th-bour administrative move, 
emergency funding was released 
which had enabled the Writing Cot--
ter to stay open until the 10th week, 
albeit with radically reduced hours. 

The Writing Center has been one 
of the most prominent environments 
for student-centered and collabora-
tive learning on campus since its 
creation in 1978. Hundreds of stu-
dents have come to the Writing Cen-
ter to work on projects ranging from 
Subject A papers to doctoral disser-
tations to commencement speeches. 
The Writing Center staff believes it 
is an integral pail of the campus en-
vironment, a place where students 
can explore and learn in a support-
ive setting. 

Currently it is almost impossible 
for students to make appointments 
for the rest of the quarter. After be-
ing understaffed all year long, we 

have finally had to pare our service 
down to the bone. 

Hopefully, with luck and some 
financial acrobatics, full service will 
resume next year. But that is little 
consolation to the student who 
wants help with next week's MMW 
paper, or Muir Writing portfolio re-
visions. 

Some of you who read this let-
ter have probably never used the 
Writing Center. You may not even 
know where it is (right above the 
Grove). But you all should know 
just how relevant the UC's finan-
cial problems have become to your 
fellow students' education. We may 
debate all we like about RIMAC, 
football, and sidewalks. But be 
aware of how a quiet little service, 
nestled away in a comer of the Stu-
dent Center, is closing its doors. An 
important service is being lost to 
everyone.

the images in it - is a vital part of 
how we think about disease trans-
mission and how we act upon it. 
Duesberg's attacks on the model are 
thus far more harmful than the irri-
tation he causes his peers by being 
a maverick.

AZT or loose living speeds up the 
disease, the presence of another vi-
rus with a correlated prevalence is 
a key cofactor, or the genetic im-

points for most of us who just want 

a basis for sane behavior.

New ID Num ...... Are 
Just Mora Red Tape 
Editor: 

A few weeks ago, I read that ID 
numbers at UCSD were being 
changed next year to some random 
number instead of the current So-
cial Security number. I believe this 
would be a serious disservice to our 
new students. 

I have been in and out of the UC 
system since 1985 with a degree 
from UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) 
and another from UC Irvine (UCI). 
When I started college, there were 
two ID numbers - an alpha num-
ber with 10 digits and a permanent 
number with six digits. Who knows 
how many tests I would have aced 
had that brain space been available 
for formulas and famous quotes. 

At UCI, the situation was a little 
better. Only a random eight-digit 
number was used. Still, by the time 
I had pulled my ID card out of my 
wallet enough times to memorize it, 
I had graduated. 

When I came to UCSD, I was 
amazed to see a number I already 
knew on my ID card - my own so-
cial security number! There was one 
thing left in the UC system which 
the administration hadn't fouled up 
- a last bastion of practicality in 
the ridiculous red tape we call the 
UC.

and weaknesses, so the class 
will move at a pace right for

CENTER: 
Continued from page 4 

No one is excluded No one eth-
nic heritage is seen as the norm, in 
which case other cu Itu res appear 
inferior. Opponents moan abo ut 
"balkanization ," "ghcttoization" 
and "voluntary segregation." But 
the "cross" in "cross-cultural" sig-
ni fi es the desire for dialogue and 
interaction. All groups intermingle 
and learn from one another. Each 
maintains its own identity; no one 
group gets melted in a pot. A "multi-
ethnic university" means that there 
is continual contact and growth in a 
process Latin American thinkers 
have called " transculturation" -
that is, the mutual transformation of 

CONFLICT: 
Continued from pace 4 
grafitti incident at the Chi Cafe last 
year as irrefutable proof that the 
sentiments of the vandal were rep-
resentative of the racism of the en-
ti re school. 

In A Nation of Victims, Charles 
Sy kes wrote that our national pas-
time of blame-evasion has ripened 
on the ivy vines of the modern po-
litically-corrcct COllegiate campus. 
Sykes noted a shift in emphasis of 
the burden of proof - no longer 
does a case need to be established 
by demonstrating the existence of 
racism. Rather, an accusation of rac-

both parties engaged in cultura l ex-
change. What fi nally emerges is a 
richer, more complex community. 

It is ironic that the Cross-Cultural 
Center was founded during one of 
the most reactionary periods in 
California's history. The recent pas-
sage of Proposition 187 and the so-
called California Civil Rights Inilia-
tive (CCRI) arc sy mptoms of the 
electorate 's economic fears and mis-
understanding of how best to real-
ize our future. The authors of the 
CCRI, for example, base their pro-
gram on two equally mistaken prin-
ciples: First, the battles fought in the 
1960s have been "won," so minori-
ties should shut up; and, second, the 
problem of underrepresentation is 
not the fault of the system. Every 

ism establishes it as fact. The bur-
den of proof rests on the shoulders 
of the alleged racists to prove oth-
erwise. This situation allows the or-
ganizers of the CCC to freely call 
one of the most minority-friendly 
campuses in the nation a racist and 
"hostile" environment without 
proof or challenge. It also allows 
them the opportunity to bamboozle 
the administration into coughing up 
over $1.2 million in construction ex-
penses and $125,000 per year in 
operating costs to build a lasting 
monument to the egos of those who 
organized the temple of ethnic nar-
cissism we call the Cross-Cultural 
Center.

availabl~ study contradicts these two 
assertions. Despite modest advances 
made at the height of the civ il rights 
movement, institutional sexism and 
racism are still pervasive. Women 
continue to earn substantially less 
than men, and, while the number of 
people of color graduating from col-
lege in absol ute numbers is up, their 
percentages among all graduates are 
shrinking. 

Affirmative-action opponents 
misleadingly quote the Rev. Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr.'s "content of

rather forget that near the end of his 
life, King specifically addressed the 
problem of institutional bias. The

wrote. "However, in our efforts to 
promote equal opportunity, we

added. 

In his letter, Leach also called 
upon the board to unite Californians 
by restoring "fairness and merit" to 
the UC system. 

Although Leach made no prom-
ises to end the programs in his June 
I reply to Wilson, outgoing UC 
President Jack Peltason wrote in a 
cover letter accompanying the reply 
that Wilson's request gave added 
impetus to the regents' ongoing dis-
cussion and review of affirmative-
action programs in the university. 

"I've made clear my personal 
view that the university, as a pub-
lic institution, has a special obli-

,alion to serve Californians of 
every race, gender and back-
ground, and that our equal-oppor-

The board, however, might not 

have such actions in store. Accord-
ing to Pursley, section nine of 
Wilson's executive order gives the 
regents added incentive to continue 
theircurrent affirmative-action pro-
grams, as it prohibits taking any 
action which would cause the uni-

he did reiterate Wilson's influence 
over the regents. "He can force them 
to take up the issue," he said. 

UC Office of the President 
Spokesman Terry Colvin, however, 
noted that Wilson's influence is lim-
ited in scope. "I'm sure it sends a 
message," he said. "[But] it's an 
advisory message at most."

. Back To Back For 

Sigma Chi 
Good Luck on Finals and 
Have a Great Summer! 

Sigma Chi picked the 
right time to finally win a team 
sport. It was down to the 
championship game of the IFe 
Softball tournament, Sigma Chi 
facing off with Tau Kappa 
Epsilon, with the winner taking 
home the banner. In the end it 
was the Sigs who garnered the 
championship with a decisive 12-
4 victory, and their second 
straight Sports Banner. 

To get to this point 
Sigma Chi had played the first 
three games in dominating 
fashion outscoring their 
opponents 42-12. In the semi-
finals the played a veteran Sigma 
Alpha Mu team that had been 
playing together for the last four 
years. It was no obstacle for 
Sigma Chi who buried the 
Sammies 18-1. 

The TKE's had a 
tougher road to the finals. In 
their first game they squeaked 
away in a pitcher's dual with a 2-
1 win. In the semis, Phi Delta 
Theta was their opponent. 
Despite falling behind early, the 
IKE offense took over in the 
second inning and destroyed a 
beleagured PhiDelt defense that 
commited numerous errors. The 

final score was 14-9. 
This set the stage for a 

chall)pionship game not only for 
Softball, but for the IFC Sport's 
Banner as well. Despite all of the 
hype, Sigma Chi socked it to the 
IKE's in the first inning, cutting 
through their defense as though it 
were swiss cheese. In that first 
inning, Sigma Chi scored five 
runs on five hits capped off by 
Satau Minami's two run single 
that proved to be the game 
winning RBI. Other notable 
performances were turned in by 
,Nghia7 Nguyen who went 2 for 
4 scoring two runs and being a 
defensive wall in left field. The 
best performance was Eric 
Quandt who went 3 for 4 scoring 
three runs getting one RBI and 
was the first leg on the Sig's 
double play. 

With the win, Sigma Chi 
won the Sport's Banner with583 
points 40 points ahead of TKE 
and 63 ahead of Sigma Alpha 
Epsilon. In fourth, far behind 
was Sigma Phi Epsilon, with 
Sigma Nu in fifth.

College graduates 
can no longer spend 
their lives climbing 
the corporate ladder. 
Finding a job in the 
real world increasingly 
means creating one 
for yourself.

UCSD Ifaduat. Lorena David Jav. up a .. borI ..... desk Job, spent two ye .. Ilvlne on • ahoeatrlnl budlet and now owns her own company. 

orena David graduated from 
UCSD four years ago with a de· 
gree in communications and a 
dream of working in the movie-
production business. 

Moving to Los Angeles, 
David got a job with an 
international film distribu-
tion company and started 

her long, slow climb up the Hollywood lad-
der. After a lillie more than a year, however, 
David got fed up with the monotony of her 
work. 

"I got sick of the desk job," David said. "It 
was really boring and dry." 

worked on projects ranging from "Plump Fic-
tion," a parody of Director Quentin Tarentino's 
film, to a pilot television show called "Writ-
ers' Block." To make ends meet, they rent out 
their AVID to other producers and are helping 
to promote a comedy group. 

It may seem unconventional, but David's 
career path is fast becoming popular among 
recent college graduates. 

"People are not going to work and follow-
ing a linear career path like they used to," said 
Barbara Wesser, marketing coordinator and 
career advisor at the UCSD Career Center.

ting at the seams as the economy changes and

self broke, but learning 
more every day and having the time of her life. 

In October of last year, David and her 
partner Mark Roberts combined their 
rolodexes, computer knowledge and movie 
industry know-how to set up their own video 
production company, Writers ' Block Produc-
tions. 

Borrowing most of the $65,000 they needed 
to purchase a state-of-the·art AVID computer

As the Los Angeles

It' •• WIIoM New ........ 

New forms of employment are emerging 
to replace the old tenets of company loyalty 
and the nine-to-five job. People are creating 
their own small businesses or pulling together 
several part-time, free-lance or temporary jobs 
which help them fit into thecbangi ng economy. 

According to Wesser, this new job market 

requires a whole new outlook and a constant 
effort to learn how to do new things. 

"It's goi ng to take the flexibility to acquire 
new skills ... ," she said. "You just can't allow 
yourself to get bored." 

"People are really having to think of them-
selves as individual entrepreneurs,"

This new career path makes sense in the 
era of corporate downsizing. Acco{ding to 
Forbes magazine, since 1985 the largest 500 
U.S. companies have reduced their workforce 
by more than four million people. 

This shift has resulted in a dramatic rise in 
the number of temporary workers hired for 
short-term projects and a huge increase in the 
amount of money sent out to smaller compa-
nies for work previously done in-house. 

But, perhaps just as important, the infa-
mous "Generation X" has found an altema-

tive to the traditional nine-to-five 
job which it finds so stifling. 

"Students want jobs that are in-
teresting and jobs that are fun," said 
Wesser. It used to be that a 2O-year-
climb up the corporate ladder was 
seen as a part of life, but "this par-
ticular generation is impatient with 
that." 

Eric Berman, who graduated in 
1993 from the Department of Eco-
nomics and now works for the rap-
idly expanding student communi-
cation service, College Club, agreed. 

"1 see so many people stuck in 
the corporate world who absolutely 
hate it," he said. "[They J are just 
pushing papers all day long [and) 
can't advance." 

CollegeClub, whichwas founded 
in the late 1980s by UCSD gradu-
ates, now has 40 employees and is 
planning for ad.ditional expansion. 

Yet, this move away from the 
traditional has not come without 
sacrifice. 

"There are things I'm giving up 
every day," said Berman ... A lot of it 
is, of course, money [and) benefits 
-a lot of those things you don't get 
when you first start up a company." 

Even more unnerving to those 
going into business by themselves 
is the loss of security. 

"Obviously, the nice thing about 
working for a big company is the

illusion that there is stability," said 
Lebeau. 

However, as the economy con-
tinues to shift away from the corpo-
rate giants, Wesser warns that no 
job is really safe. "I think security is

Many of the new en-
trepreneurs say they feel 
more secure knowing that 
they dictate their own fate, 
instead of depending on 
an aloof board of direc-

you can 
count on 

Using money from 
his side work as a con-
struction contractor, 
Davis started his own 
"micropress," called 

more 
than Cune, in May of last 
you .... lf. " year. Now he is travel-tors. 

"In general, someone 
starting their own busi-
ness is less secure .. . , " said 
Rob Porter, who owns the 

_ Rob Porter ing the country " like 
Porter's Pub Pau I Revere" to tell 

contract to Porter's Student Pub in 
the Student Center. "But there is no 
one you can count on more than 
yourself." 

Porter started running the Pub 
immediately following his gradua-
tion from UCSD in 1992, actually 
using the application to win the Pub 
contract as his senior thesis for his 
urban studies and planning degree. 
'n'. Wbo You Know' 

Davis, who now lives and works 
in Seattle, struggled to become a 
writer for years, before making the 
big-time in the late 1970s with the 
publication of The World of Pa-
tience Gromes: The Malcing and 
Unmalcing of Black Community. The 

Owner people, especially as-
piring writers, how to 

survive without having to rely on 
corporations which dictate sty Ie and 
content. 

His experience, he sailf, should 
serve as a lesson to students making 
their way through college. "Students 
... need to make a little study of the 
business aspects of what they are 
doing," he said. "A very, very real-
istic study." 

According to numerous recent 
graduates, however, many of the 
other skills ihey have needed in the 
workplace were not, and could not, 
be learned in school. 

"I really learned more from the 
extracurricu lar activ ities that I forced 
myself to do ... ," said Lebeau.

"There is almost nothing that you 
learn inaide • book that is useful to 
an employer." 

Lebeau founded the now defunct 
Hardcore Films, a UCSD film pro-
duction club, and wrote extensively 
for the Koaill newspaper as an un-
dergraduate. 

Networking, however, proved to 
be at least as useful as any practical 
knowledge. 

"The bollom line is, it's who you 
know. It really is," said Berman. 

According to Wesser, among the 
most profound of the recent changes 
in the workforce is the way people 
find jobs. Over 80 percent of job 
openings are never advertised and 
must be found by word of mouth. 

Both Lebeau and David also 
urged students to keep track of their 
friends from UCSD. 

David said that she has made a 
conscious effort to hire UCSD

The key to survival in the real

WORTH 
THE PRICE? 

Definitely. UCSD'sreputation 
is widely known, and the edu-
cation is well worth the price. 

It really shouldn't cost so much 
to go here, but when you con-
sider the marketability of a 
UCSD degree, it's worth it.

SPRING SWING 
SENIOR SALUTES: The UCSD golf team graduates a trio of standout 
performers after a successful season, finishing fourth at NeAAs 

By TEDD LADD, SPORTS EQITOR 
In the lengthy career of UCSD 

golfcoachMike Wydra, only a hand-
ful of players have graduated as 

four-year 
leHermen. 

This year, 
Wydra has two 
who are leaving, 
not to mention 
the loss of an in-
valuable two-
year transfer ath-
lete. 

The outgoing 
senior Tritons are 
Tom Brown and 

Jim O'Grady, and the essential trans-
fer player is Alex Behrend - all 
three played major roles in shaping 
yet another successful season of 
UCSD golf. 

"I would say [Brown] is the 
strong, silent type." Wydra said. 
"[O'Grady] is a fine player who 
played well for us all year, and 
[Behrend] is the guy who really 
worked some miracles for us at Na-
tionals." 

The Triton duffers started out the 
year with a strong win over UC 
Riverside at an away dual meet on 
Feb. 9. O'Grady teamed up with 
teammate Arnie Campbell to shoot 
a pair of 74 's to lead the team to a 
302-311 victory.

By TEDD LADD, 
SPORTS EDITOR 

As 15 athletes from the UCSD 
track and field team graduate and 
move on, they can take solace in the 
fact that tbey were a part of the most 
successful team in Triton track his-
tory. The emphasis is on "team" 
because UCSD's award-winning 
year was nothing short of a group 
undertaking. 

Sure, there were the standouts-
J.J. Castner, Lisa Shepard, Michele 
Domico, Renee Sprowl, 
Eryn Houston and Ernest 
Clark - but there were also 
the consistent, day-to-day 
performers . Add these 
blue-colJar efforts to the 
efforts of the superstars 
listed above, and you had 
an amazing mix, culminat-
ing in a phenomenal NCAA 
Nationals team finish. 

The season started with 
a bang, as the Triton tracksters trav-
eled across town to take on 
Claremont and host SDSU on Feb. 
18. John Walsh, Robert Ho and 
Aaron Zeller swept the first three 
spots of the steeplechase to get the 
ball rolling. 

The men - bouyed by Goss 
Lindsay, Alan Grant, Eryn Houston 
and Randy Buehler - did well, but 
slipped to Claremont and SDSU. 
The women, on the other hand, 
crushed Claremont convincingly, 
thanks to gold-medal performances 
by Renee Sprowl (high jump), Tara 

Monaghan (hammer) and Lisa 
Shepard (100-meter hurdles). 

At UCSD's next meet on Feb. 
25, the Triton tracksters were rude 
guests to the host UC Riverside 
squads. Both the men and women 
pummeled the Highlanders, by 
scores of 127-47 and 123-44, re-
spectively. 

Shepard was the highlight of the 
meet, snatching first in the triple 

jump and the 1oo-meter 
hurdles. Michaela 
Monahan, Ulrika 
Katerkamp and Monaghan 
provided additional sup-
port, while Goss Lindsay 
surprisingly edged out U. 
Castner for first in the 
1,500-meter race. 

Senior Michele Domico 
was the definitive star of 
the Aztec Classic the next 

weekend, as she nosed out a schol-
arship athlete from SDSU by a fourth 
of an inch. National qualifiers were 
also beginning to pop up for the 
Tritons - Castner earned a trip to 
the NCAAs in the 5,000 at the 
Pomona meet the same weekend, 
and Monaghan threw a qualifying 
mark in the hammer throw at the 
Aztec competition. 

Consistent performers began to es-
tablish themselves at the Aztec and 
Pomona meets. Shepard did well in 
the hurdles and triple jump, while 
Joyce Lee, aark and Buehler matched

their usual award-winning efforts. 
On March 25, nearing the middle 

of the season, UCSD hosted the Tri-
ton Track and Field Invitational. 
With over 1,600 entrants, UCSD 
still managed to leave a mark. 
Shepard qualified in the triple jump 
and hurdles, and Sprowl did the 
same in the longjump-after nearly 
not making the finals in that event. 

Other highlights included Ho 
grabbing first in the steeplechase 
and Buehler reaching a qualifying 
distance in the hammer throw, while 
sharing the pit with several Division 
I throwers. 

With the second half of the sea-
son underway, the Triton tracksters 

took full advantage, garnering 
numerous NCAA-caliberperfor-
mances at the Pomona Invite on 
April 14 and the Point Loma 
dual meet on April 22. 

Clark (400 meters), Shepard 
(1 OO-meter hurdles) and 
Monahan (400-meter hurdles) all 
posted NCAA marks at Pomona, 

MIchel. Domlco: Domico, 
pictured here during her 
freshman year, was the 
epitome of the multi-
talented athlete for the 
Tritons. She owns 
numerous school records in 
the long jump, triple jump 
and relays, while also 

while Eryn Houston (long jump) 
and Michele Domico (triple jump) 
did the same at Point Loma. 

The California State Champion-
ships were the next weekend, and 
UCSD's Lindsay automatically 
qualified for the NCAAs in the 
1,500. In addition, Domico set a 
new school record in the triple jump, 
while Sprowl captured another per-
sonal best in the long jump. 

On May 12-14, UCSD hosted 
the CCAA Championships, taking a 
fourth-place team finish. Castner and 
Houston were among the top per-
formers, but even they were over-
shadowed by the courageous per-
formance of Damian Coleman. 
Jumping with a severely swollen 
ankle, Coleman hit a personal best 
in the triple jump. 

To cap off a spectacular year, 
UCSD sent 14 athletes to NCAA 
Division III Nationals in Northfield, 
MN. Seven returned home as All-
Americans, and two as National 
champs.
