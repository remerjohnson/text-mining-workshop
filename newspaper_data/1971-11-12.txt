State auditors have suggested that the 
University of California sell some of its rare 
books to provide needed revenue for university 
operations. UC officials have called the idea 
"reckless" and "ridiculous." 
The auditors ' proposal was made as part of a 
general review of UC library operations, one of 
a series of University audits carried out by the 
state Department of Finance. 

Bill Berriesford, senior mangement auditor in 
the Finance Department, said Friday the 
suggestion to sell the rare book collections 
"may sound strange taken out of context. " 

He said " the major thrust" 'of the report is 
that California cannot afford to build expensive 
research libraries on the eight general UC 
campuses. The report suggests that major 
research collections be housed at UC Berkeley 
and UCLA. with the other six general campuses 
having much more limited libraries. 

The suggestion to sell the rare books " is just 
an item for them to consider." Berriesford said 
in a telephone interview. "It 's just a way of 
getting some money in tight times ... 

He added, " We raised the question whether it 

State auditors propose UC sell 
some rare books for more funds 

from the LOS ANGELES TIMES 

is necessary or desirable for the University to 
have rare books that perhaps the Library of 
Congress does not have. 

UC President Charles J . Hitch and other 
statewide officials declined to comment on the 
audit because it is still the subject of the 
discussions between the University and the 
Finance Department. 

However. one statewide officer who asked not 
to be identified called the proposal to sell the 
University 's rare books "a ridiculous notion." 

Local campus officials were more willing to 
comment. 

"It seemed a pretty reckless suggestion to us. 
to put it mildly," said Everett T. Moore. 
assistant librarian at UCLA. 

"Rare books and special collections are what 

distinguished great libraries," Moore said. 
"They can 't all be stamped out of the same 
mold." 

UCLA has collections of rare books about 
Leonardo da Vinci, medical history and 19th 
century fiction , among other subjects. 

" I hate to think what sort of library we 'd have 
without those," Moore said. 

He also opposed the suggestion that UC should 
depend on the Library of Congress for its rare 
book needs. 

Books are more readily available from the 
Library of Congress than they once were, but 
Washington library still does not acquire all the 
volumes scholars consider necessary and its 
cataloguing is slow. according to Moore. 

Dependence on the Library of Congress would 

cause "a disastrous breakdown in the entire 
operation of acquistion and cataloguing, .. 
Moore said. 

Dr. Herbert F. York, Acting Chancellor at 
San Diego. criticized the recommendation that 
UCLA and Berkeley should be the only major 
research libraries in the UC system. 

York said, "There is a question whether the 
state can afford to build eight research 
libraries, but we can build three and San Diego 
should be the third" because it serves the third 
largest population in the state. 

UCSD has about 800.000 volumes now. "well 
beyond the college library stage but still not 
enough to be called a general research library. " 
York said. 

Berriesford said he did not know if th 
porposals to sell rare books would be contained 
in the final audit report. which probably will be 
made public early in December. 

He said he understands the University's 
objections to the recommendations. 

" It is a difference possobly between the 
librarian's approach to what the library ought 
to be and the businessman's approach. " 
Berriesford said.

""IIII-------------------Tommy Ca/imee 

Recently. students of Third 
College Science and 
Technology (biology) classes 
have been learning ' 'out in the 
field." The students have gone 
into various laboratories 
throughout the UCSD campus 
where biological and 
technological research is going 
on. This kind of exposure. 
according to Dr . Brian 
O·Brien. a Third College 
profe sor. "gives the student 
the necessary perspective for 
the kinds of research . 
problems. comments. training 
and experience that certain 
scientists and doctors adhere 
to ." 

The students had the 
opportunity to tour the medical 
chool. where they actually 

viewed medical students at 
work in an anatomy class. To 
them. it was an enlightening 
experience. 

Barry Morinaka. a Third 
College computer science 
major. aid. " It was the fir t 
time I had seen a dead person 
with the internal organs 
exposed " 

One day Dr. O'Brien decided 
to take 'hi cia s to see the 
electron microscope located in 
Rev lie ollege 's Bonner Hall. 
While there . the tudent were 
shown the many way the 
micro cop i ' ut'ilized . 
However. some student felt 
that th instructor wa too

chemi t~' and physic . the

also learn " their importance to 
the human organism and its 
environment. " To become 
familiar with techniques of 
scientific inquiry. students will 
furthermore learn prinCiples. 
methods and tools of science. 
and their applicability to 
problems of today." This will 
be analyzed and illustrated in 
the laboratory. 

Some Third College student 
who are presently doing 
scientific research are 
pessimistic about the 
program 's future funding . 
Taboo. a marine biology major 
who is doing research on brine 
shrimp. said. " It may be very 
difficult for me to be funded by 
large scientific foundations 
because of the structure of 
American society." By this. he 
means only certain particular 
people who are high up in the 
echelons of the American 
structure receive the benefits. 
" But. probably when the Third 
College biology program 
expands. I will be able to show 
the significance of my research 

and will get funds ." Taboo 
said. 

Hopefully, Third College 
health science majors will 
acquire skills to take back into 
their respective communi tie 

Accordmg to Dr. Lloyd C. 
Elam. who i the preSident vi 
the nation's only private 
medical school for Black : 
"There are only 7.000 Black 
physicians to serve the nearly 
20 million Blacks in the United 
States." This figure clearly 
defines the need for Third 
World people to enter the 
health sciences. 

Dr. Elam. in a recent speech 
to the San Diego Count 
Medical Society. said he was 
"optimistic ." " We have 
increa ed the number of Blacks 
entering medicin about 300 
per cent in the pa t three 
years." he stated. "That' 
encouraging but it is still not 
enough ."

Who are the members? 
Why does the Comm Boord exist? 

People on this campus hear 
about how much the TRITON 
TIMES hates the Communi-
cations Board. but very few 
people know what that body 
actually does. 

Officially the Communica-
tions Board is a Chancellor's 
advisory committee. charged 
with regulating the campus 
med.ia and making 
recommendations concerning 
the distribution of funds for the 
various media. According to its 
constitution. the purpose of the 
Comm Board is to "act as 
publisher I operator of official 
campus communications 
media in attending the highest 
standards of quality. student 
participation and utilization by 
providing advice. use of 
facilities and funds . as 
available. and to insure the 
general responsiveness of 
recogni zed media on the 
campu to all segments of the 
Universitv community." 

The membership ' of the 
Comm Board consists of 
s tudents . faculty and

administrators. Each of the 
college ' s has two 
representatives . the AS has two 
and the administration has two. 
This year there has been severe 
criticism of the Board by the 
TRITON TIMES because of 
alleged conflicts of interest on 
the part of some board 
members. 

Several of the board 
members had previous ly 
worked on radio station KSDT. 
Other Comm Board members 
have worked on the CRAZY 
TIMES and DIMENSION. 
Critics contend that those 
members cannot make 
impartial judgments about how 
funds should be allocated . 

This year the Comm Board 
has come under part icularly 
hea v~' criticism because of 
delays in approving a budget. 
The budget allocations for the 
media were supposed to have 
been made in June. Final 
allocations have not vet been 
made and there has 'not been 
any indication of when they will 
be made. As a s top-flap

measure. the Comm Board 
appropriated $160 to each of the 
subsidary journals so that they 
could publish one issue. 

The TRITON TIMES is 
operating on a projected 
budget which mayor may not 
be approved. Radio KSDT by 
contrast is bein!l appropriated 
funds even though it will not be 
on the air until February at the 
ea rliest. 

Although officially the 
Communications Board is only 
an advisory committee. the 
Chancellor usually accepts its 
recommendations. Until the 
matter of budget allocations is 
settled . the Board will probably 
continue to be a source of 
controversy and people will 
probably continue to hear about 
how much the TRITON TIM ES 
hates its publisher.

Nothing to do on the weekend (or the week 
for that matter)7 Here 's an exciting new fun 
game that anyone can play! It 's entitled CON 
BOARD : the game of juvenile power politics. 
and although it may sound fancy, it's really a 
simple game: six-year-olds can play, and they 
do all the time with phenomenal success. Here 
are the easy to follow rules: 

I. Objecl: The object is to see- which team 
(see below ) can put the most political 
pressure on the "banker" (hereafter known as 
Con Board I , so as to walk away with all the 
loot I money I . 

2. Teams: The game consists of 6 teams 
lany number of people can play-the only 
stipu lation being that the Con Board can .have 
no more than 10 members) . One team 
represents Minority Groups (this team should 
always be the largest ). The next three teams 
represent : a. White Conservatives (only 2 
allowed on this team J: b. White Moderates 
Imust be smaller than ~ of Minority Croup 
team I: and c. White Yippies I must be smaller 
than 1% of Minority Groups ). The next team 
represents the Non-audible Audible Media (N-

.. ..... 
... 

a AM) (only allowed 2 members, see Special 
Rules ). The final team represents the Con 
Board . 

3. Start the Game: The game begins only 
when the Con Board decides to start it. That is, 
the Con Board can elect to not start the I!ame 
at all, in which case proceed to step 7 below. 
However. the Minority Group team can 
alwavs declare ' intimidation' in which case 
the Con Board must always begin the !lame 
I see Spedal Rules ). 

4. Sequence of Play : Once play begins. each 
team in order (i.e. Minority Groups. White 
Yippies, White Conservatives. White 
Moderates. N-a AM ) presents a proposal to the 
Con Board . This proposal is known as the 
Proposal. The Con Board has only $32,500 total 
to allocate to all of the groups. This is where 
the fun begins. The Minority Croup team must 
propose a minimum request of $4.000. The 
White Yippies must request parity with their 
opponents. The White Moderates must defend 
$21 .500 of the toal sum. And the N-a AM team 
musl always make a proposal of $8,500. When 
this is done , play proceeds to step 6b (Secret 
Meeting ). 

5. Special Rules (step 4 would be boring 
without them ): 

I a I Minority Group team I can only be used 
by Minority Croup team H . Intimidation-at 
any point . this team may claim 
" intimidation." which results in a silencing of 
everyone else except any member( S) of that 

• 
-

team. By successful use of this rule, the 
Minority Croup team can " intimidate" the 
Con Board into giving them money directly 
proportional to the amount of intimidation. 2. 
Laughing-at any point the Minority Croup 
team may laugh profusely, therefOre allowing 
no one else to say anything. again !living them 
a chance lif " intimidation" fails ) to win the 
game. 

Ib ) White Yippies lonly to be used by White 
Yippie team )-1. Accusation- at any time the 
Yippies may accuse anyone I includin!l 
themselves ) of anything. in order to stall for 
time Ifor any Yippie knows that in more time 
there will be more Yippies and the chances of 
victory will be !lreater L 2. Dope at any time 
the Yippies can say. " Dope !" If any exists . 
play proceeds to step 7 below. If none exists . 
the rule can't be used . 3. Sabotage-anything 
the Yippies can think of to win the game (e.g. 
brib<!ry etc. ). 

Ic l. White Moderates (only to be used by 
White Moderate team H . Disruption-This rule 
can only be used in conjunction with S t~p 6b 
below. The White Moderates can disrupt 
the "Secret Meeting" to such an extent that 
play proceeds to step 7 below. 

I'd ) White Conservatives-None. In thei r 
hearts. they know they're right. 

I e I Non-audible Audible Media lonly to 1>1.' 
used by -a AM I-I. Conflict of Interest-In 
addition to two team members. the -a AM 

-
• 

team also has two members of the Con Board 
team representing. them. These two members 
must always agree with any -a AM Proposal. 
2.Secret Fund-N-a AM will receive a secret 
$14.000 allocation if they receive the 
opportunity to become the Audible Media 
team . 3. Salary- Members of the N-a AM 
will !let paid . even if the Non-aud ible Audible 
Media team remains inaudible. 4. Peace in our 
Times-The N-a AM team will still be allocated 
their entire Proposal. no matter what the 
other teams get. 

6. Con Board I rules only for use by Con 
Board ): 

I a ) Order·at any time the Con Board can ask 
for order. H the other teams give none. play 
proceeds to step 7 below. 

I b I Secret Meeting-After hearing the 
Proposals from all teams. the Con Board must 
request a secret meeting. Everyone else must 
leave while the Con Board decides the Victor. 
However. play may have already proceeded to 
step 7. bu t if it hasn·t. the Secret Meeting must 
come to absolutely no final decision I although 
teams may be told what to ultimately expect L 
Play proceeds to step 7. 

7. Conclusion : Since no ultimate decision has 
been reached . the whole game will have to be 
played again next week . 

That com pletes the rules as they now exist. 
However. the players always have the ril!ht to 
add new rules or eliminate old rules each time 
they play the game. Have fun!

or death . but rather growth or 

sta~nation for the campus 
radio and newspapers . 

There has been considerable 
noslilil\' between the media in 
the past. but this ~' ear has seen 
the fruition of long-lil'ed 
IZrudj!es and dislikes. We ha,'e

still another corner the 
subsidlar~' journals like 

PJ~I~;\SJO~ and CR~ZY 
tiMES. 

And so it went last Mondav 
night. with evervbodv but 
ever~' bod~' kicking tite TRITON 
TIMES since it has the vear's 
largest budget. Or does it? 

:\s a matter of fact. it 
doesn·t. The radio station. 
KSDT. has a special lillIe fund 
et aside to help them bu.,· new 

equipment so they can go nJ. 
That little fund comes to 
114.000. Wlten "ou add in the 
$8500 more ttie~" re getting 
from the Communications 
Board. their Budget comes to 
522.500. compared 10 $6.000 last 
year . The TRITO~ TIMES b~' 
contrast. ha a present budlZet 
of S20.500. down from S20.7oo 
last year. Durin!! the course of 
the recent Comm . Board 
meetings. I saw the clever 

tactics employed by the radio 
station. 

To start. vou must 
understand that about 10 voting 
members show up at the e 
meetings and that two of them. 
Linda Clark and Mike Reed are 
present QT former employees of 
KSDT. Reed was manager of 
the station la t "ear. Thus the\' 
have two votes' cold . Then we 
have their proposed budget. 
Their operating I a 
distinguished from the specilII . 
one-time SI4.000 fund I la t year 
was $6000. Yet thev had th 
nerve aJ the start of this year to 
ask tlie omm. Board for 
S25.000: included werr such 
items as S2000 for new records. 
$1000 for a wire en·ice. SI00 
for stop watches and thousands 

more for long distance phone. 
postage and travel expenses. 
Since then. this outrageous 
budget ha been cut back to 
$8500 for this year. But note the 
net result is that KSDT's 
operating budget goes up 40 
percent in one year from $6000 
to $8500 . and the best IS yet to 
come. Due to managerial 
incompetency the radio station 
i pr enU.,· off the air entirely 
until next F ebruarv. Thu . 
thoul1h the sta tion wili not be on 
the air half the. year . It 
operating budg t i up 4Q

Many keptics have long 
wen<!ered wheth r the radio 
station is worth anything 

any~)'. It can only be. heard In 
the dorm when Ills on the aIr . 

• 

and very few people listen to it 
there. After all. if you want to 
listen to rock music all dav 
there are severa I tereo

can tune to. 

Mav be K DT is worth

Arise. romantics! Your hero 
is back aRain_ RCA knows a 
good thing when it sees it. and a 
good thing is its "My Favorite" 
series. starring Poland 's 
favorite son. Van Cliburn. This 
has been one of its best-selling 
lines. perhaps because of the 
"Greatest Hits" - type appeal 
to the dilettantish buyer and 
because of the hero - worship 
cult that has grown up around 
Mr. Cliburn. At any rate. three 
new albums have been released 
within weeks of each other : 

eurling, and the resources of 
the piano are exploited to their 
fullest extent. These demands 
are met. needless to say. with 

Minor : Op_ 117. No. 2_" 
"Intermezzo in C: Op. 11' No. 
3." "Waltz in A-Flat: Op. 39 
No. 15." "Ballade in G Minor: 

ingeniously dazzling piano Op. 118 No_ 3. " "Intermezzo in 
E : Gp_ 118 No_ 6." "Capriccio 
in G Minor: Op. 116 No. 3." 
"Intermezzo in A Minor: Op. 
118 No. 1." "Intermezzo in A: 

technique and superb 
orchestral backing. 

"My Favorite Brahms" (RCA 
LSC-3240 l. "My Favorite 
Concertos" (RCA LSC-4014) 
and "Rachmaninoff: Rhapsody 
on a Theme of Paganini. and 
Liszt: Concerto No. 2" (RCA 
LSC-3179 I. 

Franz Liszt was one of those 
composers who seemed to be 
more interested in seducing 
and impressing the ladies than 
in thinking great musical 
thoughts. and I have never been 
able to get thiS out of my mind 
when listening to his works . 
Yet there is certainly nothing 
to complain about in the A 
Major Concerto: it is indeed 
"clear in form . brilliant in 
expression_ and grand in 
style. 

Op. 118 No. 2." "Intermezzo In 
E-Flat Minor: Op. 118 NO. 6." 
All of these pieces were 
composed with an emphasis on 
simplicity and clarity. in 
contrast to the flamboyant 
romanticism of a Liszt. and are 
played with reverence by 
Cliburn. 

" My Faborite Concertos" 
contains movements from 
"Concerto in A Minor" by 
Grieg. "Concerto No. 2" and 
"Rhapsody on a Theme by 
Paganini" by Rachmaninoff . 
"Concerto in A Minor" by 
Schumann. and "Concerto No. 
1" by Liszt. Again. this is pure 
romantic and post - romantic 
stufr. played flawlessly with 
the help of Eugene Ormandy 
and Fritz Reiner. What ( find 
most striking about this album . 
however. is its revoltingly 
mushy cover . Does the flower 
stem in his hands signify that 
Mr. Cliburn has joined 
Consciousness Ill ? Is our hero 
about to deliver to us a 
profound comment on the 
human condition? The 
photographer. one Larry Long. 
should be imprisoned in a 
roomfull of acid - rock_ 

The most valuable of these 
recordings. I believe. is the 
Rachmaninoff - Liszt one. 
partly because Mr. Cliburn 
operates here under the 
inestimable auspices of Mrs. 
Eugene Ormandy and the 
Philadelphia Orchestra. and 
partly because I have a built -
in snob - reaction to "My 
Favorite" any thing- (after aiL 
why should they be my 
favorites? I. 

In this piece Liszt has 
abandoned the traditional fast -
slow - fast layout and says all 
he has to say in one movement 
like a long symphonic poem for 
piano and orchestra_ The piece 
is dominated by one melody. 
stated at the beginning by the 
clarinet. and is incorrigibly 
warm - hued romantic 
throughout. 

The Rhapsody by 
Rachmaninoff is - well. it 's a 
beautiful piece. with all the 
emotion - draining drama and 
hunting melodies one could ask 
for. The piece is fascinating in 
part because it is so complex -
the technical demands upon the 
soloist are ext,aordini\rily 

"My Favorite Brahms" is 
not mine. essentially because I 
prefer the symphonies and 
German Requiem. However. 
these pieces were all composed 
by the mature. middle-aged 
Brahms. and are thus of 
consistently high quality . 
Included are : "Rhapsody in B 
Minor : Op . 79 No . I. " 
" Rhapsody in G Minor: Op. 79 

0 _ 2." " Intermezzo in B-Flat

Dead Live with T upe/o Honey

Very often. when an artist has a lot of attlums 
out. his material comes to sound much alike_ 
When this happens. the new album get bad 
reviews from the media , and usually only 
selected cuts will be aired on the radio . You 
can't really throw the plame on the artist. 
though . because the real culprit is in the 
background: the record company. When an 
artist signs a contract with a record company. 
the contract will usually call for one album a 
year for anywhere from 3 to 5 yea rs. When 
personal appearances and tours are taken into 
consideration. there may not be enought time 
left for work in the studiO. and the recording of 
a new album will of times by hasty . 

Van Morrison has released an album a vear 
for the last four years. His sound is nice. though 
it is copied b~' many. After the English 
recording group Them I "Gloria . " "Mystic 
Eyes." " Here Comes the Night ", broke up. Van 
went out on his own. His first album for Warner 
Bro " Astral Weeks (WS 17681, proved to the 
listening audience that Van Morrison wa 
indeed a talented writer and performer. 
"Madame GeorJ!e. " probabl~' the most popular 
tune off the album and still J!ettinJ! quite a bit of 
radio pla y. was solid on the AM charts. and . that 
beinj! qu ite important in the business. 
established him as an artist. His second album. 
Moondance (WS 18351, is a classic in the true 
sense of the word. Here he combined the best of 
his sonJ! writing abilit\· as well as some great 
back-up music to produce ten beautiful tracks 
all ot which are produced to a tee and 
reproduced most excellently on record . The 
tit le track is perhaps one of the best pieces of 
music on record. and . after vou 've listened to 
the enti re album a few times. ·you can'thelp but 
Sing and hum tho e tunes endlessl~·. 

I think. thouj!h . that his third LP. IIi Band 
and Street Choir (WS t884) , fa lls down a bit. The 
album seems to lag. and some of the material 
sound a lot alike. The music is repetitive: But. 
again. ther are some redeeming features to the 
record . The recording is good . and the 
engineering is good . too. That 's one thing that 
I'll ha ve to hand to Warner Bros.: thev have an 
excellent staff of studio engineers. 'and the\-
press good records. There are a few nice tunes : 
"Craz\, Face" and " If I :\'eeded Someone." in 
which' Van Morrison di s pla~'s the vocal abilit\' 
that many hav tried to cop~·. but have been 
unsuccessful. 

Van MOrrlson's new~st album on the Warner 
Bros. label. Tupelo Honey tW 19:;01 . fit right 
into the mold . HI material isn 't that much 
different than it wa illl Moondanc . but that-s 

I 

not to say that it's bad because it's creative and 
good. All of his music seems to communicate 
the same mood. Two things that Van Morrison 
has done differentlv on the new album: he has 
changed back-up musicians again. and he has 
narrowed his area of concentration to just the 
nine tracks that appear on Tupelo Honey as 
compared to the twelve on the last album. That 
means more instrumentals. and. speaking of his 
backup. it is as good or better than before. Van 
Morrison sticks primarily to guitar and 
harmonica while Jack Schroer. who has 
appeared on Van's last two albums. handles the 
duties on the saxaphones. There are a lot of 
strictly instrumental parts in the album. The 
opening song. "Wild ight ." yOU know : the song 
that's been played on KCBQ lately. well. if 
you'll listen to that on a stereo. you 'lI hear that 
it's one of the tightest pieces that Van Morrison 
has ever been able to create with his back-up 
band . And the title song. "Tupelo Honey." is 
mellow and easy with Van again displaying the 
vocal artistry for which he is noted. 

Another p'rimo album also just out on the 
Warner Bros. label is the new Grateful Dead 
thing_ Supposedl~' _ Jerry Garcia wanted it to be 
entitled Skullfuck, but that idea was nixed by 
WB. It ·s recorded live and is a two record set. 
The Dead's Ice Ni ne Publishing Company 
reports that only five of the twelve songs 
performed were written by the band. 

For tho e of vou who haven't had the 
privilege. the Grateful Dead is probably one of 
the best live bands around : that is to sav that if 
they're not the best live band . ttiey are 
definitely in the top three. Unfortunately. the 
album doesn't show it. There's just something 
about watching and listening to Garcia play. 
The Dead create a spiritual rapport with their 
audience that simply cannot be captured on 
record . I'm not saying that the musicianship on 
the album isn 't j!ood because it is . It's just that 
there's somethinj! missing. 

The cuts are very pleasant to listen to and . at 
times. quite funky . They're into Merle Haggard 
I"Mama Tried " l_ John Phillips I" Me & My 
Uncle" I. Kris Kristofferson I"Me & Bobby 
McGee ",. and don 't forllet Chuck Berry 
("Johnnv B. Goode " , alonl! with some new 
materiai bv the Kreutzmann-Weir . Garcia-
Hunter songwriting teams. 

\I ~'ou hurry. and if ~'ou ' re lucky. you can get 
an Official Grateful Dead t-shirt with the 
album . Many of the loca l stores are giving them 

awa~' when you buy the album . That's right.

Sanders Speaks 
,.. _____________ Tommy Calimee 

Author's Note : This conversation occurred at the "Word 
of Mouth" restaurant in La Jolla one hour prior to the 
Pharaoh Sanders Concert. There were many other 
things he said, however, I feel those things should stay 
within the family - the Black community family . 

Pharaoh Sanders is a highly spiritual Black man, 
which means he does not talk very much_ He said, "All I 
want to do is play," meaning, play his saxophone_ So it 
was up to Tony Barnwell, Bill Sneed, the emcee for the 
Sander's concert, and myself to generate questions . 
Since we are all Black Brothers, Pharaoh was quite 
comfortable in answering our questions . 

T.C. First of all . I would like to know how was your experience 
with John Coltrane? . ~ 

P.S. I really enjoyed playing with Trane. for I learned quite a 
bit about music and playing the saxophone . 

T_C. What about your experience with Alice Coltrane'. 
P.S. It was allright too. although now she IS domg some 

different things_ I think she has become m.ore transcedental 
in her music. I mean . like. I think her musIc IS beautiful but. 
I am doing some things a little different. 

T.C. Do you think you will be recording another album together 
again? 

P.S. Probably not. 

T.C. Are there any particular musIcians who you enjoy 
listening to and perhaps learningfrom? 

P.S. Yes . I listen to a lot of people : I even 1ig listening to 
James Brown. 

T.C. What about people such as Miles Davis and Herbie . 
Hancock. do you dig their music? 

P.S. Well. theY 're of[ into a different thing. I think Herbie 
Hancock 's m'usic is somewhat more structured than the kind 
of thing I do. 

T.C. Do you feel that Miles Davis has gotten more "free " with 
hi s music latelv. such as " Bitches Brew?" 

P.S. To a certairi extent. What I mean is that he and) are doing 
different things with music. My music is more in relation to 
African. Oriental. and Indian influences. Miles' does things 
with electronic devices. With the instruments that ( use_ I 
think I have more freedom to really create spiritual sound s. 

T.C. Do you ever plan to retire from the musical world ? 
P_S. I will be playing for the rest of my life . It is something I 

enjoy doing for people. especially for the Black community . 

T.C. Speaking of people. the album you recorded entitled 
"Summun Bukmum Umvum " IThe Blind . Deaf and Dumb ,: 
\Vh\' did \'ou record an album with that title ? 

P.S. "ou see. a lot of people are ver~' much unaware of what is 
going on around them . All they do is just live without n~ver 
knowing nothing. Summun Bukmum Umyum IS taken from 
the hol~' scriptures of the Koran. Through mUSical 
expression. perhaps someone ma ~' become aw~re of 
somethinj! . inst ad of al wa~-s being dumb. dea L and blind . 

T.C. Pharaoh . arc you a vegetarian'~ 
P . . :\0. I like meat. 

T.C_ Have you heard of Third College before coming to the 
CSDcampus? 

P.S_ I wa told about it before I came here. Didn't Angela 
DaVIS hal'e omethinll to do with it? 

T.C. Ye . she did . She was one of the people who was primarily 
responsible for it present existence. along with other Black 
tudents. such as Sidne\' Glass who is the Third College 

Re idenl Dean and some Chicano student . 
T.C. Per hap we better get going . for it 's onl~' an hour before 

the concert. Thanks for the rap Brother. 
P.S. RilZht on .

perfornners are directed to 
listen to a particular tape 
channel and to improvise to

certain rules.

processes rather than 
individual events . with 
dimensions of " return" -
literal. implied or discovered. 
Thomas Nee. UCSD associate 
professor of music and former 
conductor of the Minneapolis 
Civic Orchestra . will conduct 
the piece. 

The second piece. "Riff 70-

Department of Music graduate 
student Peter Salemi. explores 

-, 

new techniques on the oboe and 
the bells. Larry Livingston. 
facultv member at Palomar 
College, will conduct the piece. 
Livingston. who received his 
master's degree in music from 
the University of Michigan_ is 
presently working on his Ph.D. 
at UCSD. 

The third work _ "Exposition 
on a Theme of Thoreau." was 
composed by Eric Stokes. well-
known composer of operas. 
who is currently teaching at the 
University of Minnesota. The 
piece will be conducted by 
Keith Humble . newly . 
appointed associate professor 
in UCSD's Department of 
Music. who is also a composer 
and pianist. 

Music: In Brief 
Symphony Sounds 

Chuck Hyde 

Thursday night was my first 
experience with the San Diego 
Symphony. and it proved to be 
a most enjoyable one. The 
orchestra . under the direction 
of Peter Eros. could have 
hardly chosen a more standard 
program. yet it was well -
balanced and fulfilling . 

soloists_ Some of the emotion 
missing in the Wagner 
appeared in the Copland piece. 
yet. the "gun fight" scene 
reminded me more of popcorn 
popping . The difficult rhythm 
sections were handled quite 
well. 

Eros closed the program 
with Beethoven 's Symphony 
No. 3 in E flat ("The Eroica" ,. 
He filled out the dynamic range 
more satisfyingly than he did 
with the Wagner . Excepting 
some ragged portions in the 
strings. the orchestra followed 
Eros 's broad phrases. shaped 
yet relaxed.

Opening with the overture to 
" Die Meistersinger ." the 
orchestra was at once 
impressive. especially in nice 
choral effects in the winds and 
the brass. Eros took an 
interpretation similar to that of 
Klemperer . his former 
teacher : very slow and steady . 
letting the lyricism and 
internal drama come through . 
However. it was a well -played 
dramat ic piece . but 
throughout . it wanted more 
emotion and brilliance land a 
little faster tempo I. 

. Somewhere in the middle of 
the Wagner. I discovered why 
so much of the dYnamics and 
emotions had been reduced . 
The fortissimo passages of an , 
orchestra are often entrusted .... ------------ ---------... 

Copland 's "Ballet Suite from 
. Billy the Kid - " is not Copland 
at hi s best. but can _ 
nevertheless. be a vary 
enjoyable work. There were 
some very good moments. 
including some excellent solo 
work by the flute. oboe. 
clarinet.' horn. and trombone. 
Thev do need. however. a 
bassoonist to keep up the high 
quality of the other wind 

to the brass . The acoustics of 
the bass are such tha t the 
further back on the stage a 
player is . the more he is heard . 
Allowing the brass to play the 
dynamic level written would 
(a nd occasionallv dii! ) 
obliterate the first violins . 

Excepting thi s flaw not 
controlled bv the orchestra . the 
San Diego ' Symphony played 
with fines e and restraint and 
produced a very sa tisfying 
concert. 

Pran Nath Raga 
Don Kurlander 

On Thursday. ov . 4. as the 
first concert of the Contract 
series. the UCSD Music 
Department presented Pandit 
Pran Na th. master of the orth 
Indian st~' le of raga-singing. 
AccomDanied bv American 
composer Terr~" Rile.\·. Pran 

ath sang two ragas and 
discussed some of their 
technica l aspects. 

It would be a mi stake to ca ll 
the conce rt merel~' a 
performance. Perhap it is 
be tt er desc rib ed as an 
emotional ex perience. or 

ma~' be simpl\' orne good 
feelings. 

In both his singi ng and hi 
peech . Pran i'iath has an aura 

of complete peace and inn r 
control. His music is a wa\- of 
life and he has pent ~' ear 
rna leri ng it. 

Raga singing is extremel~' 
complex in both its tonal and 

rh~· thmic structure. The raga is 
a basic melodiC progression 
upon which the inger 
improvises The raga itself is 
built on a cale called a " that". 

In the fir t part of the raga 
the singer presenls each note in 
the progre ion. attempting to 

full~' explore its individual and 
contextual qualities_ Later in 
the pi e. he Improvi on th 

raga . addi ng a thythmic 
organization called a tala . The 
singer is accompanied by a 
drone instrument. usua llv a 
tamboura. which is a four -
trin ged non frett ed 

instrument. 
Being Jmprovisator~·. a raga 

can last for hour . The first 
raga s'ung by Pran :\ath. an 
evening raga . lasted about 45 
minutes. 

A I'er~' importanl concepl in 
raga singing or playing i the 
ingularit\· of mood. For 

example. Pran :\'ath 's vening 
raga xpre sed the stillne 
and calm associated with the 
evening. This 1 achieved 
partially through th fact that 
ragas do nOI modulate . 
retaining a Single tonal center 
throuj!hout. Each raga has 1\ 
own specific mood or feeli ng. 

However . much more 
important than Ihe technical 
aspect of a raga are the 
fee lings it evoke . A raga i 
both a mu ical and spiri tual 
exp ri nce_ a way to self -
realization . A I poke with 
Pran :\ath for a fe w minut s. )

SDPD Blows It 
Ken Carr, Paul Simms, and Herb Bradley are 

three UCSD students. What happened to them last 
week deserves the attention of everyone in this 
community. 

As reported in Friday's TR ITON TIMES, the 
three were stopped by the police last Monday night 
for a routine traHic violation and ended up 
spending two days in jail. The three were detained, 
although never formally charged, on suspicion of 
armed robbery. Apparently they were taken to jail 
because there was a gun in the car. 

This episode raises several questions which need 
to be answered. The first of these is why three 
persons were required to spend time in . jail 
because there happened to be a gun in the car in 
which they were riding. The gun was registered to 
Carr and this fact could have easily been 
confirmed. There has not been any indication that 
the police suspected the three of any specific 
crime. 

This incident raises questions concerning the 
motive of the police in making the arrests, and 
questions concerning the administration of the 
judicial system. Attorneys for the three had a very 
difficult time obtaining any Information 
concerning the charges against them. By 
Wednesday morning, the day that Carr, Simms, 
and Bradley were scheduled to be arraigned, the 
arresting oHicer had not even filed a complaint. 
Generally the law requires an arraignment to take 
place within 48 hours of an arrest. This would have 
meant that the three would have had to be 
arraigned on Wednesday. On that morning 
attorneys for the three could not even find out if 
their clients were going to be arraigned • . 

That afternoon the three students were released 
without being arraigned and without knowing the 
details u to why the arrests had occurred. 

In the put there has been tension between the 
San Diego police and UCSD students. Incidents 
such as this do nothing to improve relations. The 
San Diego police should explain the circumstances 
of the detention of Carr, Simms, and Bradley. But 
more importantly, they should make a concerted 
effort to see that such a thing does not occur again • 

That this incident came to light at all is only a 
result of the fact that the three had friends within 
the University who could help. This was certainly 
not an isolated instance. Persons with less power 
may not have been as fortunate as Carr, Simms, 
and Bradley. 

The TRITON TIMES urges the University 
administration to use its influence to insist that the 
San Diego police work out procedures which will 
prevent such an incident from occurring again. 
With such a model perhaps the rest of the San 
Diego community will also be better served.

The State Capi 1 and IS-year old Rights 
On April 19. 197i. the California 

Legislature ratified U.S. Senate Joint 
Resolution No. 7. which extended the 
right to vote to citizens eighteen years of 
age or older. In the ensuing months, as 
other state legislatures debated 
ratification, Californians began to 
concern themselves with related rights

This bill is currently pending before the 
Assembly. 
MARRIAGE 

for these newly-enfranchised voters. Park', Another subject near and dear to the 
hearts of University students, in 
particular. is the right of 18-year-old

for many years. SB 1387. authored by

the full Assembly within a week. All 
interested. emancipated "minors" should 
proceed with all haste to make their 
views clear to their respective 
Assemblymen. 

Although the 1971 legislative session has 
not drawn to a complete close, it is fairly 
clear. at this point, which rights of 
majority will extend to 18 year-olds - and 
which will not. 
VOTER RESIDENCY 

The first major battle - fought over the 
right of students to determine their own 
residency - was conducted in the State 
Supreme Court, for attempts at 
legislative mandate encountered stiff 
opposition from the powers that be. In a 
suit sponsored by Common Cause (with 
the help of the UC Student Lobby ). 
students, in early August, were finally 
granted the right to vote where they live 
and attend school. This decision was 
highly controversial , but may serve as a 
valuable precedent in aiding similar 
decisions in other states.

age of majority from 21 years to 18 years

What? Me, Biod Jones versus Nietzsche 
by David K 

One would think that after experiencing the 
immense intellectual stimulation and admiring 
the originality of thought, the daring perspective, 
and the penetrating insight of the "Jesus 'view '" 
of the universe that the quest for truth was ended. 
But 10 and behold , "Charlie" (T.T .. p. 4. 11/2171) 
finds out that this is not all there is, but instead 
" that's all there is. " This is known as looking at 
both sides of the question. or. in layman's terms, 
adding to the pile. 

How many of you people out there in the cold, 
harsh world have thought lately? Pat yourself on 
the back if you have. The only " thinkers" I'm 
aware of lately were Copernicus, Galileo. 
Newton, and a few others. We all look back on 
their achievements with pride and 
simultaneously wonder about the sanity of those 
who opposed their revolutionary ideas. Boo on the 
church. Hurrah for the slayers of dogmatism! 

STOP! The Inquisition has caught up with you! 
I charge the majority o~ "modern" men with the 
high crime of DOGMATISM. Galileo would turn 
over in his grave if he knew about the betrayal of 
his methods by scientists. philosophers. writers. 
statesmen. and (Oh no! Not them !) our 
generation. 

Despite its claim to the questioning spirit. I 
believe our -generation is lost in its own dogma. 
Picture. if you will. the typical college freshman 
in his Humanities 2 class listening to his 
professor lecture on the Bible. "Genesis is myth ; 
the Bible was written by nomads. science is 
truth ; ergo God does not exist. " Impressed by the 
sagacity of his prof. the starry-eyed frosh goes 
out to spread the good word (which is four-

us? Are you. the reader. thinking critically about 
what you are learning or are you just accepting it

Would it be scientific to dismiss a hypothesis if 
the proponents of that hypothesis claim to have 
evidence to support it? "Obviously not." comes 
the reply. I claim that there exists such a 
mistreated Hypothesis . Furthermore this 
hypothesis has the potential to effect a more 
drastic change on humanity than any idea before 
it in history.

Submitted by Mark McCarty 
As we enter the final months of 1971. we find our nation in 

peril ... in the past 15 years we have witnessed a gradual 
decline of the esteem we once held in the eyes of all nations, 
friend or enemy. We are part of a new American society which 
appears ready to permit our nation to withdraw from 
responsibilities in our own hemisphere, as well as those 
abroad. We are watching our once respected protective 
military establishment wither as our enemy grows stronger 
and more belligerent. We are experiencing a trend, which 
continued. will fade us into second class status . . . Our nation is 
developing the image of a major power so obsessed with peace 
and problems at home that it is no longer favorable toward. or 
concerned with , protecting its rights and interests abroad. How 
can we avoid second-class status? ... the stature of the United 
States has been reduced in the eyes of many Asiatics and all 
Communists, who regard overtures toward negotiation as 
evidence of weakness ... Re-establishment of the strongest 
possible American naval presence in the Mediterranean is an 
urgent necessity today. The turning point in current history can 
come when the Soviet Union achieves a military force 
sufficiently superior to the United States to force a global 
showdown by nuclear blackmail. Determination by the Soviets 
to do so is well established ... The cold war will turn 
increasingly warm as a result until the challenge of power will 
offer the United States the the choice of war or surrender .. : 
Unless we respond with determination to meet the challenge of 
today, we could well have to learn to live tomorrow with the 
consequences of becoming a second·c1ass power - second to a 
nation sworn to eliminate us as a threat to its avowed objective 
of world domination. The alternative to the latter consequence 
is positive action now to rebuild and modernize our defenses 
... The outline of world domination set forth by the late Nikita 
Khruschev is moving closer to possible reality than most 
Americans and Western political leaders will allow themselves 
to believe ... As the United States faces these ominous trends 
and realities of the 1970's, we must draw upon , and inspire, an 
effective demonstration of our country's basic strengths which 
have been fundamental to our nation's progress and global 
stature ... I believe we are willing to pay the price to remain 
free. The alternative is slavery.

Editor : 
A recent arUcle in your paper 

by UCSD Students for Muskie 
declared that by ruling a Black 
off his Presidential ticket in '72 
Sen. Muskie "became one of 
the few public figures to face 
up to the problem of racism 
instead of trying to sweep it 
under the rug." 

On the contrary, I believe 
that it is those who are praising 
Muskie 's so-called "candor" 
that are sweeping things under 
the rug. Let's look at what 
Muskie said and analyze it. 

The Maine Democrat 
~eclared at a private meeting 

with Blacks. the results of 
which were later leaked to the 
press. that he would not put a 
Black on the ticket in '72 
because with a Negro he would 
be unelectable. In other words. 
Muskie was saying . the 
American people are still 
sufficiently racist that there is 
no Black 'in America, I could 
run with and be anything other 
than defeated. Surely this 
statement is an honest one. 
that is. Sen. Muskie was telling 
it as he believes it is. But the 
question of primary 
importance is : is Muskie 
correct in his assessment of the 
attitudes of the American 

people~ The facts appear to be 
against him. 

A recent Gallup Poll showed 
57 per cent of the American 
people ( enough to elect a 
President I feeling that it 
makes " no difference" to them 
If the Presidential candidate of 
their choice next year picked a 
Negro as his vice presidential 
running mate. 

The poll also showed that to 
the question : If your party 
nominated a genera lly well-
qualified man for President 
and he happened to be a Negro. 
would vou vote for him? - 70 
per cent said yes. The poll went 
on to conclude that prejudice 
towards Blacks in politics is 
presently at an "all-time low ." 

As for not holding one's 
breath until President Nixon 
replaces Vice President 
Agnew. this is irrelevant to the 
question of whether or not Sen. 
Muskie is correct in his facts . 
One thing is a matter of 
record : President Nixon has 
ruled no one off the Republican 
ticket. for anv reason. because 
of their race. creed. color or 
national origin: Sen. Muskie 
has and in the name of politica I 
expediency. 

Sen. Muskie would do well to 
remember a quote of his own in 
an article he wrote for the ew 

York Times Magazine in May 
of 1958 titled, "Can Convictions 
and Politics Mix?" 

At that time. Maine Gov. 
Edmund S. Muskie stated : 
" ... the politician should 
remember that the privilege 
and responsibility of leadership 
require the taking of risks. He 
should consider the effect of a 
departure from conviction 
upon the future of persons, the 
institutions and principles 
involved. He should consider 
that a stand on conviction . 
though resulting in immediate 
defeat. may lead to ultimate 
vindication and subsequent 
political victory : that. 
conversely . yielding to 
expediency . though 
immediately popular. will 
undermine public respect and 
confidence in him and 
ultimately destroy him 
politically ...

We all are familiar with 
Newton Harrison and the 
London fish fry . the exhibit 
recently in the basement of the 
Humanities Library. and the 
exhibit now at the La Jolla 
museum. with their living 
plants and animals existing 
before the visitor . But how 
many of us know about a 
forerunner of environmental 
art. the Grass Museum of the 
Dodge City Herald in Dodge 
City . Kansas? 

On a hill outside the building. 
several breeds of grass exist in 
patches among the regular

one : "Buffalo Grass" . It takes 
a really attentive eve to 
distinguish all the diffe'rences 
and be able to spot them later. 
sincl' many are seemingly 
lookalikes with the most subtle 
differences. 

Nearbv is the Pheasant

Park. Again . the difficulty is in 
stopping long enough to absorb 
the difference between one 
prairie hen and the next. This is 
a good exercise. visually and 
mentallv. for those who are 
used to thinking of pheasants as 
birds which throw themselves 
into the grille of your car in 
order to fill it with bird blood . 
gore and undifferentiated 
feathers . 

These two sources of earlv 
environmental art are not th'e

Having worked at UCSD for

ANew Day 
Editor : 

October 25 starts a new day 
in the life of Muir College. It is 
a very sad day because Betsy 
Wood. an academic counselor 
in the Muir Provost's Office 
terminated her job last Friday. 

Why did she leave the Muir 
Provost's Office? I think the 
students of Muir College have a 
right to know and I hope the 
staff of the TRITON TIMES 
will agree that they do . Yes. 
she left voluntarilv. bUI I feel 
that the students hilVe a right to 
know why she chose to leave. 
What is happening in a college 
when someone who was as 
valuable to the Muir students 
as Betsy was found it a 
necessity to resign [or reasons 
related to her job conditions? 
Betsv Wood is a wonderfully 
sensitive. warm. giving human 
being. She was not only 
genuinely helpful to the Muir 
students but she had an unusual 
abilitv in eeing each student 
she dealt with as a very special 
person. Again it is the students 
who are now going 10 be 
cheated by not ha ving Betsy on 
the staff. How long are we 
going to let this go on? We 
cannot afford to let someone 
like Betsy Wood resign when 
her reasons for resigning were 
directlv related to the 
conditi 'on s in the Muir 

Provost's Office. 
Since I am about to present a 

Muir Special Project Major 
proposal for approval to 
Betsy's supervisor (Mrs. Mc 
Carthy sp. ?) and to Dr. 
Stewart. I am not able to sign 
this letter. However. I hope 
that the TRITON TIMES will 
be sufficiently concerned to 
report on this matter I and not 
to be fooled by the answer 
which will be reported by the 
Muir Provost's Office saying 
that Betsy Wood left for 
personal reasons. )

She chose a quotation that 
would be appropriate for 
Christmas, but also usable on a 
note card any time of the year. 

The card contains a pen-and-
ink drawing of a Torrey Pine. 
plus these words on the front : 

"Then shall all the trees of 
the earth rejoice before the 
face of the Lord because He 
comes. " 

The back of the note paper 
contains a quotation from John 
Muir. " through all the 
wonderful eventful centuries 
since Christ's time .. . and long 
before that ... God has cared for 
these trees, saved them from 
drought, disease. avalanches, 
and a thousand straining, 
leveling tempests and floods : • 
but He cannot save them from 
fools ." 

Frye and Smith of San Diego 
printed the cards free. and 
Boise Cascade paid for the 
recycled paper. 

The Sierra Club is 
distributing 500 of them.

Tritons Spear Chapman, Win Crown-
'.)J1 1t wouW be tough to recount everything that happened. in the 
'WOrld of UCSD water polo last weekend ({our games In tow 
days! ). III fact. things went so well that it would even be tough 
to squeeZO! all of the hilights !nt~ the space alloted. But we shall 
try, so please excuse any omissions. . 

Friday, the Tritons looked mcredlbly stron~. perhaps 
because Chapman was deceptively weak. Everything seemed 
to fall into place. as the game became an exercise In fast break 
and defensive domination for the Tntons. Perhaps the most 
pleasant surprise was that everyone who played, play~ ~ell . 
It was by far the best performance by th~ vanous combl~abons 

'Ibf people that have functioned together In the p~st, and It gave 
' a great reassurance of team depth . When the fmal stats were 
in. the Tritons had taken 44 shots and put !n nearly half of them. 
The final was a lot to a little. and get thiS, nobody, N.OBOD'l, 
had more than three fouls not even Stoner. who gets kicked out 
more at his home here than he does at home 10 Bakersfield. 

A Sudden Awakening 

Saturday began at 6 a.m. for the Tritons with the first annual 
Pre-Cal State L.A. Tournament breakfast. Everyone was Wide 
awake for this event, except "Lamp" Shade, who w~s qUickly 
awakened when he stuck a piece of French toast In hiS eye 
while aiming for his mouth. Needless to say, Deano was 
thinking about improving his aim 1111 the way up to L.A. 

Photo by/Easterfl 
The team arrived in time to see CSCLA destroy a competent 

Redlands team. They beat them with everything except clubs, 
and some of the TritOns were beginning to have second 
thoughts about that French toasl. It was with this 
preoccupation with their stomachs and CSCLA that UCSD met 
Valley State. a team which. it was thought. could only match 
the locals in grubbiness. 

Surprise I VS excelled UCSD in playing what is kn.own 10 the 
vernacular as "grab-ass ." So much so that the Tritons were 
convinced that NO. 9 on the enemy team had never progressed 
past the anal stage. The Tritons tried everything to combat 
this . including the friendly approach by Turqulsl. AI~ he ~ot 
was a ball in the face from six inches. which Wiped hiS sm ile 
and almost his nose completely away. These tactics cost VS 

_.dearly. though. as four of their players went to the showers on 
fouls . 

All in all it was perhaps. the dirtiest game of the year so far. 
and one of the Tritons' worst team efforts. Yet It was strangely 
encouraging. for though once again outshot. the Tritons made a 
greater number of good shots. O'Connell had three . Reimer 
had two and Parmer once again snuffed a penalty shot In the 
goal. The Tritons got the game. and Valley was voted grubbiest 
team of the year.

A GenllemuJy Taru .... t 
In a complete turnaround later in the afternoon, UCSD 

engal/ed Redlands in what might be termed a "gentlemen's .. 
game. The ouly blood that flowed was accidental , and Redlands 
players were incessantly heard to be saying "sorry" and "Oh, 
are you OK? ". It was a pleasant change. and overall the locals 
were able to set a pleasant pace. Tbey led 10:4 .after three 
periods, at which point the fresh personnel of Stillinger: Huff, 
Gregory, Liska and Newman began swunmm~ the old figure -
eight weave. The final stats fou.nd O'Connell With four: out of a 
zillion and the rest of the sconng spread evenly, addmg up to 
11. Redlands ' scoring was even also. but just didn 't add up past 
six no matter how they tried . Redlands rationalized : they lost 
the game but won some friends. 

All this is taking place at Cal State L.A., remember? So Cal 
State I is 'nt that coincidence? ) cleverly arranged it so the 
Tritons could climb out of the Redlands game, dry off. then 
dive back in for their ~ame . Coach Fred Becker, as upset as 
anyone. tried to calm his players by saying " Well . if we lose 
everyone will know we got screwed . . . " He was promptly 
pummelled. indicating the spirit in which the game was to be 
played. 

The Tritons not only had incentive but a plan as well. Part of 
it was to have Stoner cover " Herbie," Cal State 's answer to 
Baby Huey. The Tritons went into the game as underdogs, Cal 
State having beaten Redlands and Valley by more than UCSD 
had. Cal State 's pool, Cal State 's crowd, and apparently CS 

refslas they tried to count goals for them that didn 't go in. and 
to discount the ones that did go in for the good guys) making 
things difficult. Nix on Herbie 

Stoner and ()thers did lhejob on Herbie. a~ he only scored one 
goal the entire game. The Tritons were smaller. true. but th.ey 
were also faster . quicker. and most importantly smarter. With 
their tongues hanging out. the Tritons took controL and the 
lead at the half was 5-2. A monentary lapse at the beginning of 
the second half (to add excitement I saw the score knotted at 5-
5. But with an incredible number of parents. girlfriends. the 
entire Redlands team and Pam and Trudie screaming 
encouragement and obscenities. the T~itons maintained th.eir 
cool and control. The final stats found SIX Tntons In the scoring 
columns. adding up to an 8-6 victory. the tournament 
championship. and the trophy. which Cal State impolitely 
dented when they saw victory slip away. 

Victorv IS sweet. and the Tritons. who had only lost to 
Riverside could have developed cavities with an 11-2 record . 
However. a real test came Tuesday at 4:00 p.m. with big 
brawny San Diego State . The Aztecs. who hav.e bea~en 
Riverside and other powerful teams overcame the Tfltons With 
a lot of power and very little finesse . . 

The final score was SDS 13 and UCSD 7 for the Tfltons last 
home game of the year. UCSD journeys up to the smoggy city. 
Pasadena. to engage those brutes from Cal Tech in a friendly 
game. After that the team is looking forward to t~e District III 
finals which for all intents and purposes. IS the NAIA 
cham . tournament.

Intramurals Rugby Begins Anew 
The roughest intercollegiate sport of the year has arrived 

here at UCSD. (No, remember, basketweaving will be here 
NEXT year. not this year>. The Triton Rugby Club kicks off its 
season against the Irvine Rugby Club this Saturday at lIa.m., 
which means early in the morning. The encounter will take 
place on the Rugby field outside the gym. This year 's team 
should display spectacular running ability due to a plethora I? ) 
of new, shifty and fast backs combined with the experience of 
the backs of the previous year. However. and this is important, 
there is still a need for more depth in the serum. so large beefy 
types are urged to come and utilize their spectacular muscles. 
Players and prospective players are asked (not only asked. but 
urged ) to be on the field at 10 a.m. (which is cven earlier than 
11 a.m. ) to get the side organized.

hell of it. but for those who take 
their birdie - knocking more 

.seriously. there is a possibility 
of a tournament later 
(providing that the All-Cal 
Tournament people decide 
they 'll have it this year ). 

Naturally, for those of you who didn 't think so, normal after-
game activi ties are planned. You all know what that means. so 
all you spectators are invited.
