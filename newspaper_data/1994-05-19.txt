UC Enrollment 
Continues to Drop 

. BUDGET: University officials 
say recent fee increases are 
mostly to blame 
By .......,., Nicoli 
St." Writer 

UCSD undergraduate registration for the 
1993-94 school year has decreased significantly, 
reflecting a system-wide decrease in UC enroll-
ment foUowing UC budgetary constraints. 

According to the Registrar's Office, while 
13,744 students registered for Spring Quarter 
1992, only 13,162 students registered for this 
spring. 

These numbers are consistent with overall 
UC statistics that reflect a system-wide de-

crease of 2,081 students from fall of 1992 to fall 
of 1993, according to Senior Admissions Analyst 
for tbe Office of the UC President Elizabeth 
Tamayo. 

According to Assistant Vice Chancellor for 
Undergraduate Enrollment Richard Backer, sys-
tem-wide budget cuts and rising fees have signifi-
cantly contributed to the decreased enrollment. 

"It's a complete reaction to the entire UC sys-
tem. UCs are accepting fewer students due to 
budget cuts, ~ Backer said. 

Fees have increased over $600 between the 
1992-93 and 1993-94 school years. 

Additionally, more than 500 UCSD students 
who registered last quarter were missing from this 
quarter's registration.

EVENT: Jewish student 
plans outing as a first step 
towards reconciling 
differences with the AASU 
By Den Kreuu 
Co-News Editor 

Members of the African-American 
Student Union (AASU) and the Union 
of Jewish Students (UJS) will partici-

· pate in a hike through Cuyamaca State 
Park on Sunday in an attempt to relieve 

· the tension generated by recent racial 
controversy between the groups. 

According to UJS member Michael 
Barron, who planned the event, the 
goal of the hike is to improve personal 
relations and eliminate stereotypes 
rather than to resolve volatile issues 
over which the groups are hopelessly 
deadlocked. 

"You can't battle a person's percep-
tion of what's right or wrong," said 
Barron. "I offered [the groups] an op-
portunity to leave that all behind. " 

Barron said that the forums held to 
discuss the controversial Nation of Is-
lam (NOI) visit to an AASU-sponsored 
event were "a complete and utter fail-
ure" because they broke down into 
shouting matches. 

"I was in no way less offended than 
anyone else," said Barron. "But the 
point is that being offended doesn ' t get 
us anywhere." . 

AASU member Angela Boyce, who 
· co-signed the invitation to the event, 
said that the hike is intended " to be a 
social gathering." The goal , she said, 
will hopefull y be "to make people more 
comfortable with each other." 

"I think people are looking at it with 
an open mind," Boyce added. " I hope it 
will change the hearts of people be-
cause education is more than just class-
rooms." 

Others said they are not as optimis-
tic about Sunday's hike.

Internship Book 
Author Visits Campus 
EMPLOYMENT: Stanford University graduate 
discusses the secret to landing an ideal job 
IyMuM . ....., 
sr." Writer 

With summer vacation and 
graduation just around the bend, it 
ia likely that many students and 
graduating seniors will soon be 
looking for internships to increase 
their chances of employment in 
America's stagnant 
job market. 

lowdown," Hamadeh said. "We 
found that findins a good intern-
ship is like finding a needle in a 
haystack. 

"Basically, we set out to write a 
book that we would have killed for 
when we were looking for our 
internships," he added. 

To aid students in 
this pursuit, two 
Stanford University 
graduates, Samer 
Hamadeh and Mark 
Renata, have 
authored America's 
Top]OO Internships, 
a book which details 
results of their re-
search into the 
country 's most well-
regarded internship 
programs. 

Hamadeh was on 
campus last week to 
"spread the word of 
internships to all of 
those worried stu-
dents," he said.

Hamadeh, an 
ex-graduate stu-
dent with a 
bachelor's de-
gree in chemistry 
and a master's de-
gree in mechani-
cal engineering, 
and Renata, who 
holdsa bachelor's 
degree in math-
ematics and a 
muter's degree 
in English, are 
certainly no 
stransers to 
inte[ship pro-
grams. 

"Between the 
two of us, we did 
11 internships 
ourselves," said 
Hamadeh, add-

... H ....... 

The two authors 
analyzed over 1,000 

Co-author of America's Top 
100 Intemshlps 

U.S. organizations' internships, 
ranging from the entertainment in-
dustry in Hollywood to botanical 
work in Hawaii. Each internship is 
described in detail, with quotes 
from former interns as well as cat-
egorical ratings of each program. 

Hamadeh said he and Renata 
based their ratings on such criteria 
as job skills training, monetary 
compensation, quality or life and 
u Hamadeh puts it. "extras." 

These extras, said Hamadeh, 
include parts in skits on "The Late 
Show with David Letterman," 
front-page articles for large-circu-
lation newspapers and the chance 
to work with MTV stars such as 
Kurt Loder and Tabitha Soren. 

The book aiso includes such 
information as when and where to 
apply, monetary compensation and 
the amount of busywork. in addi-
tion to more detailed "tidbits." For 
instance, interns at the National 
Tropical Botanical Garden on 
Kauai learn a lot of gardening tech-
niques, while interns who work 
for the FBI teceive a day of train-
ing in firing a pistol. 

According to Hamadeh, the idea 
" for the book came from mutual 

frustration on the part of the au-
thors. 

"You can go look for intern-
ships in your career services de-
partment or you can look at the 
Peterson Guide, which is just a list 
of thousands upon thousands of 
jobs, but you never get the real 

ing that he 
worked as an intern for technical 
companies like Chevron while 
Renata worked for MTV and the 
Supreme Court. 

According to Hamadeh, many 
of the internships have both ad-
vantages and drawbacks. 

"In some fields, like entertain-
ment or TV, the work is unpaid, 
and there's a lot of srunt work." 
said. Hamadeh. "However, you 
may get to make a lot of COMec-
tions for future jobs, or work on a 
game show at MlV.ln other jobs, 
the work is great and you get paid, 
but there might not be much of a 
nightlife." 1 

Nonetheless, said Hamadeh, all 
of the programs provide the op-
portunity for exposure to a given 
field. For this reason, the two au-
thors paid particular attention to 
the positive aspects of the work. 

"It's pretty touah out there. 
There are all of these studies corn-
ing out which tell everyone how 
hard it's becoming to get a job," 
said Hamadeh. "So we asked all of 
these employers what it's going to 
take to get a job ... we always got 
the same answer. Experience is 
the primary factor now." 

Hamadeh said that internships 
are the perfect way to increase 
one 's chance of permanent em-
ployment. However, he added, 
interm,hips are also becoming 
much more competitive, even 
those which only offer tedious, 
menial work.

President Monique Fogelson. 
Fogelson said she will not attend 
tbe event because "I think members 
of the AASU are ·hypocritical." 

Fogelson added that sbe didn't 
want to put time and effort into 
resolving the dispute with the 
AASU ·if they would not meet her 
half-way. 

"It's finc and dandy, to say 'let's 
go on a bike and forget about it,''' 
said Fogelson. "But the AASU has 
never made any statement about 
the [anti-Semitic] content of the 
NOI speech." 

In addition, Fogelson said she 
was discouraged by rumors that 
AASU members asked A.S. Presi-
dent Carla Tesak to step down be-
cause "she is a Jew who wants to 
take over the campus." 

lJ C: Analyst says 
there are fewer 
eligible for enrollment 

Boyce denied the allegation, 
sayins AASU members asked 
Tesak to resign because "she 
proved herself to be a partisan 
player." 

"She wu willing to throw aside 
another group [the AASU] to get 
elected," Boyce said. 

Fogelson said she "will put 
forth more energy Fall Quarter" 
because she has more faith in next 
year's AASU leaders.

"I am very ashamed of that," 

Barron said. "[Wagner] may have 
ruined it for all of us." 

Barron said that although he 
has no estimate of how many will 
attend the hike, he has received 
support from UJS and AASU 
members alike. 

Boyce said she expects a low 
turnout not because of a lack of 
support for the idea, but because 
some AASU members arc not en-
thusiutic about spending the day 
biking - especially as the aca-
demic year draws to a close. 

According to Barron, while 
anyone ia welcome to participate 
in the hike, the event is targeted 
specifically at relieving tensions 
between the AASU and the UJS. 

"In my opinion, the issue of 
black empowerment is not just a 
black issue. It's a human issue,"

Semitism is also a human issue.

Proposition Ie Is a 
Vote For the Future 

Budget ~u~ layo~~, fee increases, department closures, pay cuts. 
The scenano IS familiar. As the California economy continues to 
wane and billions in scarce public funds are routed to the war on 
crime, the Universily ofCalifomia, once considered thecrownjewel 
of the state, heads steadily toward privatization and lhird-rarequalily. 
The ~r Plan, California's pledge to provide a qualily higher 
ed~on to all of its residents, haS been scrapped under a pile of 
political and economic exigencies - and perhaps a few hefty UC 
salary packages. 

California's wavering committnent to higher education - re-
flected i~ the UC as well as the California Slate Universily and 
commumly college sySlems - is manifesl in the crumbling infra-

s~~~ al college camJJUsc:S. Many buildings are in disrepair, 
facllltles are outdated and mechanical and elechical sysrems are in 
need of replacement Some structures are far from meeting mini-
mum state building codes. On June 7, regisrered California voters 
will have a chance to reverse this neglect by voling for Proposition 
IC. 

~ I C is a $900 nilllion bond measure which would provide 
morues to UC, CSU and communily colleges for basic repair and 
upgrade of campus infrasbucrure. At UCSD the bond would allol 
so~. $11 million for projects ranging from upgrading wood-frame 
buildings on campus and at Scripps InstilUtion of Oceanography to 
the refurbishment of disabled ~s at Galbrailh and Bonner Halls. 
Prop IC is a basic, no-frills measure which seeks to maintain the 
integrily of college campus infrastructure. It provides no funding for 
new buildings. 

But with a stagnant economy, the stench of privatization cOl1tin-
ues to linger in California Opponents of the bond argue that the tax 
burden ofCalifomia's college systems is already too heavy and that 
students, not the "working public," should carry the load. The idea 
that students should fOol the bill for maintenance is ludicrous. Slate 
~Ile~s - public-owned, public-operated and public-oriented in-
stJlUbons - are beneficial to (J/t California residents. 

SUCh. thinking, sometimes justifie'd by insulting depictions of 
Generabon X college students living the easy life and being "too 

I~," or sirnplisti~ arguments about the benefits of privatization, 
SIgns ~ death certtficate for both California's systems of higher 
educatJon and the stare's economic recovery. 

As college fees increase across the board and financial aid cannot 
keep up, fewer people can afford a college education in California 
[t's no secret lhat one of the primary reasons that businesses continue 
t~ operate in California, despite relati vely high taxes, is because of its 
hIgh number of college-educatoo adults. [r's also no secret that 
college-educated adults contribute significantly to the state's tax 
base. 

Prop I C, of course, won't stop the seemingly endless string of 
UC, CSU and community college fee increases, nor the closing of 
departments or the layoff of university staff and faculty. Its goals 
are much more modest: giving California's colleges a much-
needed structural tune-up. The future of public higher education _ 
both inside ~ outside of California - is becoming increasingly 
unsure, so thIS IS a step we cannOl afford to miss. V Ole yes on Prop 
IC.

the social life on this campus. For once, someone will actuaIl~ be

the tops of campus buildings. While lhis, too, has its merits, it 
certainly is no Sun God Festival.

Thunda,., May 19, 1994 

By Huther Huo PhIlO .. 
Staff Writer 

The experiences of Asian-Ameri-
can women are deeply imbedded in 
the fabric of American society, yet 
people have little knowledge about 
what it means to be an Asian-Ameri-
can woman. 

The b'lIditional stereotypes of"Gei-
sha Girls." propagate the myth that 
women of Asian heritage are particu-
larly "exotic" and submissive. The most 
recent and widespread stereotype is 
that Asian Americans constitute a 
"roodel minority," a group of people 
who are upheld as a roodel for other 
ethnic: minOOties to emulate in tern1i of 
economic: and social success. This myth 
perpetuates the notion that other ethnic 
minorities are culturally deficient and 
denigrates the sbUggles that Asian 
Americans continue to face - Asian 
Americans are still discriminated 
against on JmIly levels of society. 

These SIeI'eOt)'pCSarenot only dam-
agingto the image of Asian Americans 
in the eyes of the American public. but 
are also confusing for Asian Ameri-
cans them;elves - women in particu-
lar. TheIe are many questions in the 
Asian-Americancomnunitythathave 
been left WWlSwmd. For instance, 
how should Asian andAmerican'~ 
tities blend? When: do Asian-Ameri-
can women fit in as "wOmen of color'?" 
WbaI does it mean 10 be an Asian-
American lesbian? What kinds of is-
sues must refugees and adoptees within 
the Asian-American conununity deal 
with? How should the Asian-Ameri-
can community deal with the contra-
diction that Asians are supposed to be 

the model minority, yet are still dis-
criminaIed against on many levels? 
On Friday and Salurday, Sisterbood 
Across the Waves (SAW) and UCSD 
will host an Asian-American Women's 
Conference to discuss these questions. 

Many people have little awareness 
about the ways in whic:h Asian-Ameri-
can participation in various civil rights 
movements has shaped their roles as 
activists. One of the reasons for this is 
that there is little cohesion between 
Asians in the activist community. In 
the words of the conference orgllliz-
ers. "00 we have III Asian-American 
Women's Movement? In what ways 
can present and future generationscon-
tinue 10 build from the di verse experi-
ences of activism and cammunity? 
Who is excluded or misrepresented in 
the 'we' that we speak of? And what 
are the uses and responsibilities in 
claiming' Asian-American feminism' 
as a stralegy?" The conference seeks 
to bring Asian-American women t~ 
gether in pan-ethnic alliances to de-
velop answers to these questions. 

Duringtheconference,partic:ipanlS 
win critically examine Asian-Ameri-
can feminism, develop coalitions and 
aHiances. foSler inter-generational 
connections and establish plans to 
sustain the politic:al momentum the 
confeience will create. TIvough pIe-

gies, ages and classes have been able 
to come together to discuss their ex-
periences. 

This conference seems soexciting 
that many non-Asian Americans want 
to attend. However, I believe that 
sometimes, especially in this case, 

even allies should refrain from par. 
ticipation. For people of .other 
ethnicities to attend the conference 
would be to invade these Asian-
American women's space. Although 
I am by no means a separatist, I do 
believe that at certain times people 
need a place to gather with others of 
similar heatage. The activistcommu-
nity for Asian-American women has 
a low visibility -often these women 
don't know about each other's activi· 
ties. They need a space to meet to 
share, articulate and honor one 
anothers' struggles and experiences. 

This does not mean that we should 
always stick with people of our own 
ethnicity, gender or class. But it does 
mean that we occasionally need to 
step back from what we want · and 
think about what may -be best for 
others. For me- a white person who 
is used to being a member of the 
domillliiit power structure - the idea 
that tbo:re are places where I don't 
belong is difficult to swallow. I am 
used to having access to anything I 
want In general day-to-day Ii ving. I 
am not usedtohaving anybody tell me 
"no." I have never had anybody look 
down on me or make fun of me be· 
cause of the color of my skin. I am 
rarely in a room where I am in the 
minority. However, because of a 
simple difference in melanin, people 
of color have been forced to Ii ve with 
these prejudices. Though whites rarely 
think about these things, people of 
color have to deal with daily instances 
ofindividualand institutionalizcddis-
crimination. As a white woman, I 
know I need to recognize the privi-

U I I " ~ 
OPiNION 5 

Ieged position I am in and do every-
thing I can to right these wrongs. 

One way 10 do this is to suppo!1 
people of color in their struggle for 
empowennent. This may mean that, 
as in the case of the conference,l need 
to tell myself "no." That is fine, be-
cause it means that fortwodays, Asian-
American women will have a chance 
to access the kind of privilege that 
whites have experienced all theirlives. 
For Asian-American women at 
UCSD, the opportunity to attend this 
conference wi II help create a sense of 
belonging and identity. 

It may seem thalnon-Asian Ameri-
cans should anend the conference to 
learn about Asian-American women. 
However, many parts of the confer-
ence aren't geared toward this type of 
learning. The purpose of the confer-
ence is to help bui Id and define Asian-
American women's alliances, and 
having whites attend Ihe conference 
would bring up issues thaI the orga-
nizers and participants may not be 
ready - or willing - to discuss 
within the context of an Asian-Ameri-
can women's conference. 

There are, however. select plenary 
sessions on Saturday that would be 
valuable for everyone. To non-Asian 
American woman,l would say that we 
should understand Ihal we are guests 
and that our role at lhe conference is 
not to teach others, bul to learn. Ex-
cluding ourselves from it is by no 
means rtlcist. It simply shows a com-
mitment 10 our sisters' emotional and 
intellectual development. It means that 
we acknowledge and honor our friends ' 
search for their own communily.

PARTY·REsPONsmLY AT SUN Gon FESTIVAL 
Editor: 

On Friday. the annual Sun God 
Festival will be held at the Siin God 
Lawn, with an evening concert held in 
the Price Center. Over the yWs. the 
ASUCSD has brought outstanding 
bands for the coocen and the aowds 
have gouea larger over !hose years. 
The event wiD be open only to UCSD 
SIUdenIs and guesrs (18 and over). The 
Price Center will be fenced in with two 
enttances: one by the founrain and the 
other by Round Table. Each entrlDCe 
will have security personnel checkini 
IDs. In addition. no alcohol, cans. 
bottles, sports bottles, cameras or re-
cording devices will be allowed into 
the venue. If anyone is visibly intoxi-
cated, they will be denied entrm:e. 
The ASUCSD needs to likes these 
precautionaJy measures to ensure that 
we can continue to hold these events in 
the future. Most imponandy, students 
need to show thai they can pan)' re-
sponsibly. Please do not jeopardize 
future Sun God concerts. 

A byproduct of the Sun God Festi-
val has been a large nwnber of parties 
before and during the concert resulting 
in a great deal of intoxicated partici-
JlIIIIS disrupting the festivities, ~ 
ing problems for security and Campus 
Police. We are asking that you party 
responsibly and leave your aloohol 
behind. The music will be ouIstand-
ing, but be aware and be sensible. 

We at the ASUCSD are aware that 
these precautions may seem overly 
protective but we also realize they are 
necessary to ensure the safety and well-
being of all attendees. The ASUCSD 
wants to continue to program and not 
be restricted by the actions of a few 

who do not care enough to watch out 
for themselves, let alone others. We 
want you to have a great time, enjoy 
the show andaet home safely. So let's 
work rogecher on Frir:ay and show the 
powers IhIl be thai we can be respon-
sible and still rock 'n' roll.

EdIter: 

The withdrawal of the Smith v.

is bodl aood and bad news for this 
campus. An orpnizItion's ·funding

baed onalinsle incident Even with-
out its proc:edural flaws, the com-
plaint was frivolous and could not 
have succeeded. The good news is 
that time and money will not be wasted 
on it 

'The bad news is that the AASU 
has managed. at least so far, 10 avoid 
responsibility for its role in the recent 
evenIS. An imprasion may have been 
created. bodt inside and outside the 
AASU. that the organization is above 
the law. 

Students of all races could benefit 
from a strong and ~ AASU. 
They do not benefit, however, from an 
organization which sponsors a forum 
with an openly racist speaker; an 
AASU that, in this forum. rules un-
comfonable quesIions our of order, 
and by doing so turns the event into 
political propIpI1da; an AASU that 
inrerprets "blacIt empowerment" in 
ways thai could only further isolate 
the African-American community and 
int1ame racial divisions; an AASU 

that does not feel itself bound by the 
same rules and stnndnrds of conduct 
as others. 

With the SlIIilh v. Regt!nts com-
plai .. now withdrawn, the AASU's 
1994-9S funding has been rescued. 
One cannot say the same of the 
AASU's reputation and its status in 
the community.

liams said. Ultimately . such 
knowledge will lead to improved 
fire wety and engine efficiency, 
he added. 

Williams said that the 
"microgravity" conditions o(spac:e 
will provide an opportunity to 
study aspects of combustion that 
cannot be observed on earth. 

"The object is 10 remove buoy-
ancy, " said Williams, adding that 
this factor contributes to the insta-
bility of a flame on earth by creat': 
ing bot gas that must rise through 
cooler air. 

"If you light a match [on earth), 
the flames go up," said Williams. 
"[In space), the hot gas doesn't 
rise." 

To mimic weightless conditions 
on earth, scientists typically re-

Backer added. 

Director of Student Financial 
Services Tom Rutter said the Fi-
nancial Aid Department has done 
its beat 10 offset the increase in UC 

lease fuel droplets from under-
ground "drop IOwen" that stretch 
the length of the Washington 
Monument. During the several 
seconds it taltes to reach the bot-
tom of the tower, the droplet is not 
¥fected by buoyancy or other dis-
ruptive, gravity-induced forces. 

Williams said. however, that 
this technique does not provide an 
adequate zero-aravity environ-
ment. 

In addition, he said that scien-
tists have only a small amO'Unt of 
time to study the reaction before 
the droplet reaches the botlOm of 
the tower. 

In space, larger droplets can 
provide test burna lasting almost a 
full minute. This makes it much 
easier for scientists to study the 
combustion process. 

Without the effects of buoy-
ancy, according to Williams, a 
flame is spherical. This permits 
researchen to develop more accu-
rate theories about the forces in-

fees. 
"As fees increase, more money 

goes inlO financial aid in the form 
of grants," Rutter said. 

He added that the neediest stu-
dents receive financial aid in the 
form of grants, and those who need 
less receive loana and work study. 

However, some students say 
they feel financial aid has not ad-
equately served their needs. 

NOTICE 

The UCSD Guardiu 

volved in combustion normally 
masked by earth's gravity, he said. 

Williams also said that fuel 
tends to bum more slowly in a 
weightless environment. From this 
characteristic scientists can infer 
information about the chemistry 
of combustion not available on 
earth. 

Another consequence of longer 
buming times. said Williams, is 
that the flame produces more soot. 
The motion of the soot can then be 
used to estimate the velocities of 
expanding gases. 

Williams added that soot can 
also be a hindrance because it tends 
to disrupt the spherical shape of 
the flame. 

Approval for the project can be 
credited 10 a combination of Wil-
liams' 2O-year devotion 10 com-
bustion research and the interest 
of NASA scientists. "[NASA-offi-
cials) encourage us 10 continue 
when they think it's going to lead 
to something," Williams said. 

Nadina Powell, vice chair of the 
Student Affirmative Action 
Committee (SAAC), said that ai-
tbough higher fees may bave in-
creased the amount of grant 
money available, tbe money is

- .THEY MIGHT 
BE GIANTS 

By Dan McDowell, ~taff Writer 
Although They Might Be Giants' new album won't hit the 

music stores for several months, the band is doing a small preview 
tour and will land at ucsO's Price Center Plaza Friday at 7:30 
p.m. for the annual Sun God Festival. Full of wit, charm and 
quirkiness, the duo has added a full band to expand and elevate its 
sound. Giants has consistently released albums, EPs and even 7" 

. records on a yearly basis since its 1985 debut. Over the years, it has 
gathered a cult following which flocks ·to the regular mini-tours 
around the United States and Europe. During a recent phone 
interview, John F1ansburgh, the guy with glasses, reflected on the 
eVOlution of the band and music in general.

Flansburgh: This is somewhat 
of a preview show. It essentially 
will be our old show with some 
new songs thrown into it. In the fall 
we have an all-new show support-
ing the new album with some of the 
old songs thrown in. There really 
is no sensible reason to be touring 
right now. We' re playing just be-
cause we like playing, kind of like 
the Dead. 
You only recently be..,. 
tourlna with I full bind. 
WMt CluHCI the declalon to. 
c:hInp from I duo to a band? 

We had toured extensively be-
hind Flood and had been doing the 
show in New York for several years. 
During that time, the stages kept 
getting larger and the show began 
losing immediacy and intimacy-
which was more because of the 
success of the band than anything 
else. The show was working, but 
we wanted to change it, to kept it 
fresh. Initially, weonly toyed with 
the idea of having other musicians. 
We were going to have special 
guests just walk out on stage for 
part of the show. The full band 
thing began as an experiment, but 
now we 've stuck with it, and it has 
opened new possibilities. 

For the new album, we put to-
gether the material with the band, 
and we did a record the old-fash-
ioned way for the first time. It was 
a good experience because we had 
been creating songs that we never 
played because they were not part 
ofthe show. The new album, which 
is called John Henry, has 20 songs 
- more songs than ever before, 
and they were all recorded live in 
the studio, which gives it a differ-
ent sound than past albums. 
Do you think this hi' 
chana'" the direction of the 
aa.ncl1 

The spirit of They Might Be 
Giants is still intact. There isn't 
that profound a difference in our 
approach. What we are about hasn't 
changed at all. We' re still the same 

over-caffeiDlled, manicdepreasaot 
bud we've always been. Sonicly, 
we have expanded a little bit. It is 
the natunl evolution to pt into the 
craft part of what we've been do-
ina for 10 lona. It wu often diffi-
cult performing live, we had to 
strip down the arrangements, so 
that John and I could do the show. 
Now we have really good soloists, 
with high levels of musical skill to 
back us up and bring us to a whole 
new level. We can't pretend that 
we are going to make everybody 
happy. We're pretty specific. If we 
made music for everybody it would 
probably suck. 
How do you fit Into today', 
alternative music scene? 

First off, alternative music as a 
label is suspicuous. Does the num-
ber-one album on the alternative 
chart appeal to the least amount of 
people71t doesn't make any sense. 
The notion points out the inherent 
contradictions of the scene. In the 
'80s a big percentage of the alter-
native music was British pop that 
was too awkward or sophisticated 
for Middle America. We are pretty 
far outside of the popular currents 
of the music scene, whatever that 
means. 

Many of your SOIIa' ..,.,... 
to .. 1I&ht ........... and fun-Iov...., but there Is ott.n a 
atroq ................... . 
How do you combine the 
two elements? 

We eiljoy having the freedom to 
do a full range of things that are not 
easily defined. Simple definitions 
often make shortcomings more 
apparent. We don' t have a tremen-
dous pretense to the band. We don't 
demand to be taken seriously. The 
songwriting is very personal -
we're not reaching out to the audi-
ence in the way other bands do. It is 
our tbing, when we play to an audi-
ence it's like, these are songs we 
dig. It's not about communication. 
It 's more about expression. Songs 
written for your own head commu-
nicate more to most people than 
the socially-conscious songs, 
which I've labeled "newspaper 
rock." Most of those are dead-on-
arrival rock songs, very impersonal 
and dull. When the performer is 
writing for an audience, it seems to 
be an empty gesture.

Meat Puppets 
Barul reaches new heights, on latest album 

By..."N ..... 
Hiatus Editor 

For over a decade, the Meat 
Puppets' music has been waiting to 
be discovered. The band, which 
performs Saturday night at the 
World Beat Center, has a unique 
style, which borrows equally from 
country, rock and punk. The 
group's lyrics are 10 offbeat that 
they make the 8052s appear con-
ventional. What other rock group 
sings about a "severed goddess 
hand" or "thoughts [that] are made 
of lincoln logs"? With the succesa 
of the single "Backwater" from its 
new album Too High To Die, the 
Meat Puppets is getting the atten-
tion it always deserved. 

During a recent phone interview 
from New Hampshire, wbere the 
band was on tour with Crack;er, 
bassistCris Kirk;woodsaid thecriti-
cal acclaim that has accompanied 
the release of TooJfigh only means 
the band will continue macng 
music on its own terms. 

"We've definitely gotten more 
popular and that will maybe allow 
us to continue. We reached cruis-
ing level, but now we're in that 
land where you have to suffer," 
Kirkwood said. "Right now, • Back-
water' is number three on the AOR 
[album-oriented roc:It) charts, 10 
we're no longer the ratty Meat Pup-
pets. I'm going to make people pay 
with my newfound power." 
. Despite positive reviews, 
Kirk;wood doesn't think Too Hig" 
is any better than put albums. 

"This album got a '80' from 
Entertainment Week;ly, and they 
gave our last one a higher grade," 
he said. "I don't give a crap. Rock; 
criticism is just someone who hu 
access to the media. The main dif-
ference with the new album is that 
it's recorded really well. It's just a 
typical record by us. I don't care 
what other people think." 

Kirkwood, who wrote the lOngs 

CoufIIIy 01 MIchIIt HIlI'*"' 
The Meat ......... ' .... "'m Is Too ",." To DIe, 
"Station" and "Evil love" on Too 
High, wu blunt about the group's 
lyric-writing process. Trying to 
seek out deep meanings couched in 
the off-kilter metaphors is not nec-
essarily going to get listeners any-
where. 

"Most of the time they [the lyr-
ics] are just drivel," he said. "It's 
my way'of having fun with words, 
and it's purposely vague and pur-
palely pointless. I use wo,ds as 
color and sound and put all my 
emotion into that. I don't use heavy 
or dramatic tones. The lyrics are 
coming from a different place -
that's one of the reasons the band 
has lasted as long as it ha. We 
purposely keep things in a large 
scope and with a specific outllook. 
It 's gottacome from a certain vague 
place." 

As a band that started recording 
hard-core punk music for SST 

Records, an independent label 
based in Lawndale, California. 
the Meat Puppets has evolved 
musically, but bun 'llost any of 
its taste for the absurd. With an 
altemative music scene that now 
launches unknowns into the spot-
light for brief moments of fame, 
the Meat Puppets has earned ita 
SUCCIIa through conatant tour-
ing and recording. What does 
the future hold for the band? 

"More fucking shows, death 
and a few minor details in be-
tween," Kirkwood said. "The 
future holds: who Imows? We'll 
continue to go on. I don't care 
about any of these alternative 
scenes. They' re a bunch of 
tribalistic chimpanzees." 

The Meat Puppets perform 
Saturday at 8 p.m. at the World 
Beat Center with Cllainsaw Kit-
tens and Cell.

CRUNCH nME: With a trip to the College World Series 
on the line, UCSD must dethrone the Cal Lu Kingsmen 

THE UCSD B~SEBML (28-4) TEAM WILL 11ty 1'0 add to what bas been already a phenomenol season when it hosts seventh-ranked Cal Lutheran this weekend in the West Regionals 
at Triton Stadium. The the winner of the best-

of-five game series, which opens Friday, will ad-
VIDCIe to the Division OJ College World Series in 
Micbipn. held May 26-31. 

The Tritoas will, most likely throw their ace, 
Ryau Flanagan (8-2, 2.12 ERA), agaiDSl Kingsmen 
starter Marc Weiss (9-1, 3.01 ERA). 

Led by Head Coach Lyle Yates, the fourth-
ranke(\'frito'iiS'W'ill try to thaintain the same game 
pll1l that ~nabled' them to set school records in 
victories (28), batting average (.326) and ERA (2.51). 

The tale of the Triton offense may be told by the 
success of leadoff mau Eric Quandt QUandt, the 
team's leading base-stealer (11), finished the season 
sIroag after slumping badly in the early-going. 

"We'd like to get Quandt and [Jason] Aguilar on 
bese 1 lot. 10 we can get the RBI-guys-up with guys 
on base," Yates said. 

Those RBI guys are Chris Miyake and AI 

". 

DelFavero, who finished one-two respectively for 
the team lead in RBI's. Mucb of the focus this 
season bas been on Miyake, who not only reached 
the .400 plateau, but also tallied a 31-garoe hitting 
streak dating back to last year. 

To keep Cal Lu at bay, the Tritons must keep an 
eye on Kingsnien leadoff man Jason Wilson, who 
was successful on 29 of 34 stolen base attempts. 

The Triton pitcbing staff, which performed tre-
mendously throughout the 1994 campaign, is filled 
with talent. Flanagan, Marc Abrams (3-1, 4.45), 
Mark Hartmann (6-1, 2.84) and Steve Height (5-0, 
1,85) make up the starting pitcher arsenal. Closer 
Kurt Luhrsen (5-0, 0.96 ERA), who set a school 
record for ,saves in a season (6) and career saves, 
solidifies a strong bullpen. ' 

"We'd like our starters to get us deep into the 
game," said Yates. "But if they can't, I'm very 
confident in the abilities of our set-up guys. 

"The players are Oat-out ready. Friday couldn't 
come soon enough," Vates added.

FILM 

Cronos 
Vampire film has dark hurrwr 

By YIIZIIIIn QIIoMIm 
Staff Writer 

Many films deal with the theme 
of the quest for eternal life, but 
few explore the issue witb the 
unique vision that 29-year-old di-
rector Guillermo del Toro exhibits 
in his debut film CrlHtos. 

The plot centers around a 14th 
century alchemist whose obses-
sion for eternal life leads him to 
invent the CronOi device, an oval-
shaped gold case which looks like 
a large egg. Before it has the chance 
to be used, a sudd'en earthquake 
buries the Cronos and its maker. 

Four centuries later, Jesus Gris 
(Federico Luppi), an aging antique 
dealer living in present-day 
Mexico City, discovers the device 
hidden in a statue. Intrigued by the 
strange object, Jesus holds it in his 
hand, winds it up and soon discov-
ers its mysteries. 

Meanwbile, an old Mexican 
industrialist (Claudio Brook) bas 
acquired the alchemist's diary and 
searches for the device as his life 
slowly ebbs away. The industrial-
ist discovers that Jesus has the 
CronOi and sends bis burly Ameri-
can nephew Angel (Ron Perlman) 
after it. 

The film has won countless 
awards, a unique feat for a debut 
by a young director. While an-

swering questions during its pre-
miere in San Diego, Toro ad-
dressed the issue of his youth. 

"Actually, I'm a terribly old 
man at heart," he said. "CroMs is 
permeated by a strangely old sen-
sibility, with nostalgia, with a 
mortal sense of loss." . 

Toro also said his love for his 
deceased grandmother influenced 
the film. This is reflected in the 
role of Jesus' granddaughter Au-
rora (Tamara Smith), whose silent 
love for her grandfather is evident 
even though she only says a few 
words in the film. 

Cronos is not a straightforward 
drama, as its plot might suggest. 
The "vampire film" is filled with a 
dominating dark humor that is 
personified in Angel, whom Toro 
described as a "sensible man with 
the mind of an aggressive gorilla ... 
an enormous man who is worried 
about a tiny nose." 

Although the characters of 
Cronos may seem too cartoon-
l.ike for a m~em-day story, their 
hfperbolic cbaracteristics make 
the film macabre, yet humorous. 
Though CronOl' plot is simple, its 
characters successfully add a twist 
to the vampire legend. 

Cronos is playing at the 
Hillcrest Cinemas. Call 299-2100

Watch your back. Tommy

you beu is the voice of the 
new Kings owner screaming 
for the head of Barry Melrose. 
Right now. it would be safer to 
be on a talk show with 
Madonna than to be a manager 
in L.A. 

Now in faiJllcss to the 
Lakers and Clippers, they had 
to make coaching changes. 
Magic Johnson told the Laken 
he didn't want the job any· 
more. And the Clippers are 
required by an obscure federal 
mandate to fire a coach at least 
every two years. Besides • 
getting fired by the Clippen is 
almost like a mercy killing at 
tbis point. 

But the Angels firing Buck

This was appuently not 
good enough for the Angels'

After shooting a 303 on Tuesday, the Tritons 
roared back and smoked the course in 294 yester-
day, leaving them at 597 halfway through the 
championship. 

Methodist, taking full advantage of its home 
_course, shot a 299 the fint day and then blistered 
King's Grant's bermuda fairways for a 290 score 
on Wednesday. 

Greensboro University scrambled back into 
third after rebounding from a 312 showing on

must have skipped the last couple of holes on

BUCK: Rodgers 
is over and out 
ContInuM ............ 
office, "Sorry, Buck. We jUil feel 
lite we need to make a change," a 
smilingBavaai probably said. "Don't 
let the door hit your surgic:ally-re-
paired hip on the way out.· 

The inside dirt is that Rodprs 
was too critic:al of his YOUDI club, 
that he had the temerity to actually 
express displeasure with the lack-
luster way the Aoaels played abe 
pme. And we all know bow unfair 
it is to criticize a team with a .400 
winning percentage. 

lfthe Angels' management wants 
to blame anyone for their team's 
sub-par performance, they'd bitter 
look in the mirror. It was, after all, 
the Angels who traded popular start-
ing pilcher Jim Abbott for untested 
first baseman J.T. Snow. 

~ is bavina a fine seMOD for 
himself in New York. Snow is hav-
ing a pretty aood season 100-as the 
starling first baseman for Triple-A 
Vancouver. The Angels are also the 
wizards who traded for Kelly 
Grueber before checking to see if 
Grueber was able to walk under his 
own power. 

Th ........ y, May 19, 19M 

When manapment is makina 
deals like tbis-deals that make tbe 
San Dieao Padrel think, "Hey, 
maybe we don't have the dumbest 
ownen after all- - there's not a 
hen of a lot that Buck Rodpn or 
any manaprcandotoitop the bleed-
jog. When Gary DiSarcioa il tbe 
starlina lhortstop, when Joe Grabe 
is the clOIer, when John Furell is 
pitcbina in your starting rotation. 
you doD't need toc:banp managers. 
You need divine intervention. 

MaDllcrs have never bad a 
lenltby stay in Anabeim. Genc 
Maucb luted for five years, which 
makes him the dean of Anpls man-
agers. Other than t4at, it's been 
lD08Ily a bunch of one- or two-year 
stints from lIUlDI8eriallegends like 
Del Rice, Norm Sherry, Cookie 
Rojas and Mooee Stubm,. RoIeanne 
and Tom Arnold's marriage hu 
more stability. _ 

So what doea that leave the An-
gels with, apart from a couple of 
divisional titles in the early- '80s 
and the distinction of once having • 
manaser named "Moose?" Itleavea 
them with a new mlDlJCr, the afore-
mentioned DiSarcina at short and a 
team that's headed nowhere fut.
