Day Care Cost Disputed 
By Parents, Whitehill 

Clean-up begins after 'be food filb' I" Revelle Cafeteria 
on Halloween. "".,0 ." ~ Udlter 

By Eric Harpell 
Staff Writer 

Fonner assistant to the Vice-
Chancellor of Student Affairs, 
and Co-chair of the Reg Fee 
Committee, Rick Whitehill , 
said at yesterday's second 
meeting of the Day Care Info 
Board, that the cost of the day 
care center was "exorbitant." 

In addition to those expressed 
by Whitehill, opinions were 
heard from parents who dis-
cussed what they termed the 
vital need for day care and the 
need for expansion of the Day 
Care Center.

$400-$1 000 in Damage 
Food Fight Tears Apart Cafeteria 

By Steve Morus 
S&aff Writer 

The aftermath of the food 
fight last Tuesday in the 
Revelle Cafeteria that caused 
"between $400 to $1000 dam-
age" to the facility will force 
the closing of the cafeteria 
during Saturday Brunch to 
allow the carpet to be cleaned, 
Larry Barrett, head of Housing 
and Food Services, said yester-
day. 

The cle~ming of the $6000 
carpet, which was newly 
installed this year, should be 
finished in time for dinner 

service SakJrday, Barret said. 
In addition to the food and oil 
stains on the carpet, the drapes 
will also need cleaning, said 
Barrett, increasing the bill. 
Other expenses stemming from 
the food fight will result from 
replacing a window broken as 
students fled from the dining 
area, and from making up any 
wages lost or incurred from the 
temporary shut down. 

According to Connie Crone, 
supervisor of the Revelle 
Cafeteria, an attempted food 
fight on Halloween night "has 
been a sort of tradition at 

Revelle the last two or three 
years." "We were well pre-
pared this year," Crone said, 
"but they (the students in-
volved) fooled us." Although 
she had nQ certain knowledge 
that a food fight was planned 
for this year, Crone said the 
dining room lights were 
gua rded as a general pre-
caution. 

AS Approves Fu~ding 
For Five, Holds Four 

Besides guarding the lights, 
Crone said, the Resident Dean, 
RAs and regular cafeteria 
workers were on hand the 
whole meal to discourage any 
attempt. Unfortunately, those 
safeguards proved to be in-
adequate. 

According to Revelle Resi-
'dent Dean Judith Edwin, who 
was in the cafeteria when the 
food fight broke out, enough 
confusion to circumvent the 
safeguards was created when 
the serving bay and kitchen 
area lights went oui around six 
o'clock. Apparently, Hou ing 
and Food Services head Barrett 
conjectured , an unknown 
person shut off the kitchen 
circuit breaker by mistake 
after first gaining access to an 
utility room beneath the 
cafeteria through the tunnels 
under Revelle Campu . Steps 
are being taken now, Barrett 
said, to prevent any other 

The AS Council approved 
funding for five student organi-
zations Wednesday night and 
postponed consideration on 
four others because of ques-
tions regarding official regis-
tration or type of projects 
undertaken. 

A request for funding by the 
National Alliance Against 
Racism and Political Repres-
sion was tabled becau e of a 
proposed program by that 
organization in which a speaker 
from the National Lawyers 
Guild was planned, the subject 
to be immigration law, ac-
cording to the program request 
the Alliance submitted. 

AS Commissioner of Com-
munications Bill Friedman told 
the Council that the Nat'l 
Lawyers Guild was a "well-
known anti-semetic organiza-
tion," and because of that 
objection, consideration was 
tabled until the next Council 
meeting. 

The other organizations 
temporarily denied funding,

director of Counseling and 
Psychological Services, spoke 
primarily on the financial 
feas i bility of the Day Care 
Center. Informing the com-
mittee of his long -standing 
opinion on center financing, 
Whitehill said, "The center is 
very expensive per user (re-
ferring to the cost per child) . I 
felt that the expense was 
exorbitant." Whitehill said the 
cost per user of the day care 
facility is .. seven or eight 
hundred dollars in registration 
fee." 

In comparison with other 
registration fee-subsidized 
services, such as OASIS , 
intercollegiate athletics and 
counseling for psychological 
services, the cost per user of the 
center is by far the highest, 
according to Whitehill. 

Financial Aids, another Reg 
Fee-subsidized program uses 

Revell alumnus Tom Shepard 

"about 30 dollars per user, " 
according to Whitehill. Tb 
amount used by Financial Aid 
is the lowest among student 
services. Said Whitehill, "Mos 
programs run in the one

eighty dollar range. It 

Whitehill also spoke on th 
negative aspects of the Day

small number of childre 
receiving care, and lack 0 
facilities currently available t(l 
the children. " The cost pee 
child," said Whitehill, "would 
be substantially reduced if 
there was a larger facility.'

mittee that too few needy 
parents are actually provided 
with day care services.

Remember when Revelle

Well, probably not , since

around for ten years or more. 
But to Tom Shepard , who

Political Claims J3ased 
on Elections Outrageous. 

By Donald M. Ro&bber, 
AP PoUdeal WrI&er 

WaslaiDI10n - If pollsters 
and political scientists are 
correct, the mood of America 
this political year is so apa-
thetic some races could end in a 
scoreless tie. / 

But a massive show of 
indifference won't discourage 
politicians from drawing some 
outrageous conclusions from 
the results of next Tuesday's 
voting. 

For example, if the Repub-
licans pick up 30 or more House 

seals and two or three Senate 
seats·, GOP National Chairman 
Bill Brock will proclaim that 
the voters have repudiated the 
record of the 95th Congress and 
particularly its rejection of the 
Kemp-Roth tax cut bill. 

If the Republicans pick up no 
more than 30 House seats and 
break even in the Senate, 
Democratic National Chalr- ' 
man John C. White will pro-
claim that under the leadership 
of President Carter, the Demo-
crats held to a minimum the 
losses nonnally suffered by the 
party in power in non-presi-
dential election years. 

1910 Republican presidential 
nomination. 

If Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. 
of California is re-elected 
easily, what will that portend 
for 1980? Will Brown chaUeDle 
Carter for the Democratic 
presidential nomination? If 
Brown wins, his decision on 
1980 is likely to depend more on 
how President Carter is doing 
than on the California vote next 
week. 

And then there are all those 
campaigners abroad in the 
nation whose names are OD no 
ballots this year. ~ 

Vote No on Props K,L 
If the Democrats pick up a 

seat or two in the Senate, 
Jimmy Carter's 'grin will grow 
a few inches wider even though 
some of his m ost difficult 
moments the last tow years 
came from tryin, to deal with 
the Democratic majority in 
Congress. 

Ronald Reagan bas been in 26 
states and George Bush in more 
than 40. Sen . Bob Dole of 
Kansas, althougb not up for re-
election this year, is maintain-
ing a similar schedule. 

All three want the Repub-
lican nomination and have been 
spending a lot of time in New 
Hampshire, the state with the 
first primary. 

Editor: 
I know election verbiage 

reaches a saturation point, but 
for you San Diego residents, 
there are a couple of ballot 
measures that affect you as 
members of the UCSD com-
munity. Proposition K (and 
similarly Proposition L) seeks 
to sell city land, to the east of 
UCSD near University Towne 
Centre, into the hands of the 
developers. Living in this area, 

this spectre haunts me enough 
to try to bring it to your 
attention, too. What I now see 
as a pleasant, peaceful vista of 
chapparal, smelling oh so fine 
after the winter rains, will 
become another source of 
congestion and smog, a black-
top expanse to feed the chain-
store appetites.

The ritual of party leaders 
reacting to election results 
always has them looking for 
silver linings no matter how 
dark the clouds. 

More interesting and out-
tageous this year should be the 
efforts to link the 1978 returns to 
prospects for 1980.

running for re-election to the

Rep. Jack Kemp, the Republi-
can former football quarter-

Rep. Philip Crane of Illinois, 
the conservative who is the only 
announced candidate for the 
GOP presidential nomination.

ambitious Republicans who are

collecting - they hope -
political chits exchangeable for 
convention votes in 1980. 

Theatre Wronged 
Editor: 

Regarding Janet Falk ' s 
letter-to-the-editor, in the Nov. 
1st edition of The Guardiaa. 

I fail to understand how she 
could derive all that bullshit 
from an account of a play. 

As a drama major I think that 
I know a little about the field 
Ms. Falk was trying to analyze. 
A play whether it be a comedy 
or tragedy does not always 
appeal to everyone. But to 
relate a play to a personai 
experience such as rape and 
then disagree with the play 
from that point of view is 
narrow-minded . Ms . Falk , 
because she WaS a rape victim, 
is more aware than the average 
about rape and rape victims. 
But to look for it in such a trivial 
IlSpect of life, such as a play is 
absurd It is algo creating an 

obsession that should not be 
forced on other people. Being in 
theater I am probably just as 
touchy about people putting the 
theater down as Ms. Falk i8 
about people taking rape so 
lightly. But I feel that any play, 
speech, movie, opera, or 
concert that you attend is 
enlighting and that it opens 
your mind to the problems of 
today. She was wrong to tell the 
readers of The Guardian to 
boycott the play for the reasons 
that she listed. Rather thu 
boycotting a play just bec8Ulle 
someone stated an unfavorable. 
opinion of it, I feel that you 
should go if you want and then 
fonn your own opinion of what 
you saw!

Campaign Nears Finale 
Brown, Younger Trade Debate Attacks 
LOS ANGELES (AP) -

Evelle Younger condemned 
Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. as 
" the biggest spender in the 
history of California" in their 
fourth debate yesterday and 
again blamed Brown for forced 
busing in Los Angeles. 

The Democratic governor 
disputed both allegations , 
saying his administration was a 
model of fiscal frugality and 
denying any responsibility Cor 
busing to integrate Los Angeles 
schools. 

Brown and Younger , the 
Republican nominee in the 
governor's race , also tried to 
top each other as to who is 
tougher on crime. Brown said 
he consulted Republicans to 
find the toughest parole people, 
while Younger said Brown 
" hasn't shown any leadership" 
in curbing crime. 

Younger, the state's attorney 
ge neral , attacked aggres-
sively, as in earlier debates, but 
Brown apJ)eared more con-
fident in his responses, and 
deflected some attacks with 
humor. 

On the issue of nuclear 
power, an area in which Brown 
and Younger have their sharp-
e st disagreement , Brown 
contended that Younger's pro-
nuclear policies would even-
tually cost California tax-
payers an extra $43 billion. 

Brown challenged Younger 
to say exactly where he would 
put the radioactive waste from 
the 30 nuclear reactors Young-
er wants to build in California. 

" In which counties do you 
propose to store that cancer-
causing radio-active waste? " 
Brown said, ..... Los Angeles,

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
One of the chief sponsors of the

Dennis Peron , 30, com-
plained Wednesday that his

Peron aired his gripes at a

he is serving a six-month

Clark Gains; Dymally Says 
Curb Outdoes Even Nixon 

(AP) - Political charges and 
smears flew in all directions 
yesterday as the long 1978 
campaign entered its final 
days. 

And Ed Clark, the Liber-
tarian Party candidate for 
governor , scored another 
modern first for minor party 
candidates in California , 
picking up tbe endorsement of a 
major San Joaquin Valley 
newspaper, the Bakersfield . 
Californian. 

Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. and 
Republican nominee Evelle 
Younger both suspended cam-
paigning for the day to cram for 
Thursday night's final debate 
on statewide television. 

Among political develop-
ments: 

Jarvis - Tax revolt leader 
Howard Jarvis announced in 
Detroit, where he is campaign-
ing for a measure similar to 
Proposition 13, that he ' has 
decided to endorse neither 
Younger nor Brown. 

"Both men deserve credit for 
their efforts to implement Pro-
position 13, and I applaud that," 
the crusty retired businessman 
said ... It is commendable that 
for once politicians have 
responded to the 'Will of the 
people. It remains to be seen 
what will happen in the future ." 

Clark - The Libertarian, 
who qualified for the ballot as 
an independent by collecting 
over 100,000 voter signatures, 
was praised by the Bakersfield 
Californian for his government-
cutting philosophy in its first 
endorsement ever of a minor 
party candidate. 

" As a third-party candidate, 
we concede his chances are 
marginal , but we support this 

48-year-old Los Angeles Attor-
ney's political philosophy, 
which we believe echoes the 
new spirit of California resi-
dents," the newspaper said. 

" We don' t see him as a real 
threat to unseat Gov. Brown, 
but a wave of the future that the 
incumbent should be listening 
to .... We think Clark's candi-
dacy is a refreshing intrusion in 
the long-established two-party 
system." 

Dymally-Curb - Lt. Gov. 
Mervyn Dymally said his 
Republican foe, recordi ng 
executive Mike Curb, outdid 
Richard Nixon by asserting 
that Dymally had committed a 
crime and would be indicted. 

The Democratic lieutenant 
governor told reporters that 
Curb's claim was worse than 
the former president's famous 
remark that Charles Manson, 
then still on trial, was guilty of 
murder. 

"What Cu rb did was worse," 
Dymally said. " Manson was 
imprisoned at the time . Agrand 
jury had passed judgement on 
him . In this case, you are 
talking about a public official 
who bas not even been to court 
except for a traffic ticket. " 

Burke-Deukm~jian - Demo-
crat Yvonne Burke said her 
Republican opponent in the 
race for attorney general , state 
Sen. George VeuklJleJlan , is 
conducting a campaign of 
innuendo, suggesting that a 
black woman might be soft on 
crime. 

The black congresswoman 
said in response to questions at 
a news conference, .. I would not 
allow the fact I am black or a 
woman prevent me from 
enforcing the law. It 's an insult 
to the voters ' intelligence."

cast from Hanoi said thousands 
of Chinese reinforcements 
were dispatched to the border 
area on the Chinese side. It 
described the situation as 
" critical" and said the Foreign 
Ministry condemned the al-
leged border violations as 
" criminal acts." 

Western sources in Bangkok 
said tension along the frontier 
has mounted in recent weeks, 
but speculated that a full-scale 
conflict was unlikely . They 
also noted that official Chinese 
media has not reported much 
on the border situation. 

The quarrel was sparked ear-
lier this year by Chinese accu-
sations that Vietnam was mis-
treating its ethnic Chinese pop-
ulation . The situation worsened 
as about 160,000 of the Chinese 
made their way to China. 
Beneath this, most analysts see 
China's anger at Vietnam's 
close ties to the Soviet Union 
and Vietnam's ongoing border 

war with Cambodia, a Chinese 
ally. 

The official Vietnamese 
broadcasts claimed that a large 
number of Chinese troops pene-
trated the Trung Khanh district 
of Cao Lang Province on 
Wednesday. A later broadcast 
sai d hundreds of Chinese 
soldiers crossed into Cao Loc 
district, near the site of the 
earlier incident, opened fire 
and set up observation posts 
before being driven away by 
Vietnamese militiamen 
Wednesday night. 

The radio said many Viet-
namese were killed and wound-
ed at Trung Khanh but gave no 
casualties for the Cao Loc 
fighting where it claimed 
Vietnamese militiamen drove 
the Chinese back across the 
border and destroyed oberva-
tion posts they had set up on 
Vietnamese territory. 

There was no independent 
confirmation of tbe fighting.

Since the introduction of an 
effective vaccine in the early 
60s, tbe number of people 
contracting the viral dlHase 
hat been decreaaing eacb year. 
During the decade 1950-59, for 
example, there waa an averBle 
yearly report of case. of 
measles totallin, 13 tima the 
number reported lut year. In 
addition, so far this year, the 
number of measles cases 
reported is only about half of 
tba\ listed for the equivalent 
period in 1177. 

Cbildren of motbers wbo 
bave already had the dlHaae 
receive a "paajve immunity" 
from the mother's system, and 
will not be susceptible to 
Infection for four or five months 
after birth. From that poiDt, 
thoulh, they becoDH: extremely 
vulnerable. Lalit year, over 
~ of the reported c .... of 
mea.le. were in tbe a,e 
bracket of 5 years to 19 years. 
Of these, well over half were in 
the group of those over 10 years 
old. For this realon, most 
states have adopted the strat-
egy of requiring that children 

be vaccinated before they enter 
grade school. 

CurrenUy, however, only six 
of the 49 states wltb such 
immunization requirements 
are enforciDi them strictly. In 
these atatea, an avera,e of only 
27 out of every million people 
contracted meales during the 
first balf of tbis year. as 
compared to 352 out of every 
million In tbe states not 
enforcln, the vaccination 
mandate. Before immunization 
was demanded at all, each .tate 
showed about the same in-
cidence of outbreak. 

The plan for eUmiDatine the 
measles vi1'U8 in the United 
State. ba.ically Involves a 
broadeninl and an enforcinJ of 
the acbool immuniJaUon pro-
,ram., and improved .ur-
veillance of other pos.ible 
arou .. of suaceptible people. 

Measles wi1I not be the first 
disease to diuppear due to the 
consciou8 efforts of human 
belnp, tbou,h. The laat re-
ported cue of smallpox 0c-
curred in Somalia almost a 
year ago. If by 1979 110 further 

appearance of smallpox is 
noted in that country or in 
nelJhborin, areas the disease 
will be recoJDized as having 
been eradicated. 

Because of its virtual ab-
sence everywhere on earth, 
smallpox is now conaidered 
such a sllJbt threat that visitors 
to the United States are no 
longer required to receive 
vaccinations a,aiDst the dis-
ease. Currently, the only people 
advised to ,et smallpox vac-
cinations are thole who will be 
traveliDJ to certain areas in 
Africa, Alia, South and Central 
America and workers in 
laboratori.. wbere relle8rch 
involves the virus re.ponaIble 
for tb6 dlaeue. Such labora-
tories, and the vaccine, Itself, 
are DOW probably the soul'Celof 
the Jre8te1!1t riak of infection, as 
all natural sources have been 
eliminated. 

The incldencea of cholera and 
yellow fever have also been 
greatly leuened in recent 
years; so much so that vaedna-
tion a,aiOlt these diseases was 
dropped earlier in this decade 
as a precondition for entrance 
into this country.

He referred to the student

current Day Care Center stafC 
member, "WOUldn't have

Whitehill told the committee 
that while "This isn't a bad 
program," it is incorrect to say 
"This is the model program," 
reiterating that the small size 
of the Day Care Center was the

Before his early departure 
from the meeting, Whitehill 
told the board that Reg Fee 
funding depends on "how much 
our students are will!ng to 
subsidize. " 

The Registration Fee cur-
rently subsidizes $25,475 in 
annual fundine for the Day 
Care Center. 

The "frustration of the 
parents" over lack of con-
venient child care services, 
was described to the committee 
by Harriet Romo, a UCSD 
,raduate student and pa ..... t 
who was forced to seek off-
campus child care for her two 
younK children. Romo said tllat 
she pays a total of P40 a rnon&h 
for child care service ... A 
resident of Solana Beaell, 
Ramo must drive her children 
to two separate faclJltiea of tbe 
Montessori School each mol'D-
ing before comiDi to UCSD. 

The third meeting of the Day 
Care Info Board will be next 
Tuesday in tbe North Con-
ference Room. A repreaeata-
tive from the busiJleu oftlce,

with tbe local San Diego

all thrown out for diarupting the

Despite tbe8e impreSSions, 
almost all the students were 
generally interested in and 
serious about their s~es. "I

For many, those years were the 
most traumatic, insecure and 
delperate years of their lives." 
Shepard illustrated this point 
by describiDI a fri,btening 
rumor that was circulatin, on 
campus about President 
Johnson's plans to cancel the 
Presidential elections in 1968. 
"We were affected by a wholly 
different set of imperatives, 
with a feeling that the world 
was at a critical turning point. 
There was no way of escaping 
the pressures," he said . 

Looltin, back at those events, 
Shepard mused at how society 
bas substantially cbanged 
since then, especially the way 
this Is reflected among student 
concerns. "The importance of 
entering into a career ladder is 
of much more immediate 
concern to students today," be 
said. .. Back in 1966 jobs were 
really of secondary impor-
tance. We thought of ourselves 
as social agents for change; we 
were trying to comprehend the 
changes occurring everyday."

very persistent personal cam-
paign in the case of PropoSition 
6. 

The tobacco industry had 
spent $3.2 million as of two 
wee~ ago on the campaign 
agamst Pr.oposition 5. and most 
observers expected that in-
tense campaign of television 
and radio commercials to top S5 
million by election day. 

That's $1 million to $1.5 
million more than either Gov. 
Edmund Brown Jr. or Republi-
can gubernatorial nominee 
EveUe Younger are expected to 
spend on their campaigns -
making it the most costly 
campaign ever conducted for 
any candidate or issue in 
California history . 

Propo.ltlon 8: 
Homosexual. 

Both sides in the Proposition 
6 campaign have been pinched 
for funds . But what they lack in 
money. the foes and supporters 
of thf! homosexual teachers 
initiative more than make up 
for in emotional intensity. 

Proposition 6 would directly 
affect relatively few Cali-
fornians. compared with ProJ)-
osition 5, which would have a 
real effect on almost every 
Californian, smokers and 
nonsmokers alike. 

lican wbo led the Proposition 6 
campaign while running unsuc-
cessfully for governor, says 
homosexuals are a threat to the 
children of the state. 

Opposing the measure. 
Brown says it smacks of 
,. McCarthyism" and could lead 
to a witchhunt in California 
schools. because it would 
require hearings into the 
fitness of any teacher or 
counselor accused of advo-
cating homosexual conduct 
whether that person is homO: 
sexual or not. 

A key factor in the apparent 
turnabout of public sentiment 
against Proposition 6 may be 

repeatedly in respODse to 
questions ~ until he hears it in 
penon from the former gover-
nor. 

In the campaign against 
PropoSition 6, supporters of gay 
rights have a chance to score 
their first victory at the polls 
after a series of defea~ across 
the country. 

In the last two years, resi-
dents of Dade County, Fla .• Sl. 
Paul. Minn., Wichita, Kan., and 
Eugene, Ore .. have voted 
overwhelmingly to repeal local 
ordinances banning discrimi-
nation against homosexuall in 
jobs and public accommeda-
tioos. 

..• Brlggs has lashed out. at hls-
foes, charging Brown with 
"pandering to homosexuals" •.. 

opposition of poUticalleaders of 
both parties. 

In addition to Brown. almost 
every prominent Democratic 
politician has' announced 
opposition to 6. 

On the Republican side. 
former Gov. Ronald Reagan 
says while he disapproves of 

~ny advocacy of homosexuality 
ID schools. he believes current 
laws are adequate and the 
Briggs initiative " has the 
potential of infringing on basic 
rights of privacy and perhaps 
even constitutional rights." 

Finally. Younger. who had 
attempted to stay neutral on 
Proposition 6. said a week ago 
that he " probably" would vote 
against it because "it isn't 
needed." 

In response. Briggs has 
lashed out at his foes, charging 
Brown with "pandering to 

The California campaign is 
different in several respects. 

Opponents of homosexual 
rights have no exJstinglaw aa a 
focus of their outrage; tbe 
California Legislature. bas 
rejected attempts to pass a non-
discrimination law, while also 
defeating a Brills blll that 
resembled the later initiative. 

Instefd, the fundamentalist 
religious groups backing 
Proposition 6 must defend their 
proposal against attacks on 
constitutional. economic and 
moral grounds. 

Also. the Briggs measure bas 
an element missing from the 
earlier campaigns: the pro-
psed ban on "advocating 
soliciting, encouraging, im~ 
poSing or promoting public or 
private homosexual acts ."

By Lyneue Tom 
In the worda of Universal

modern-day detective thriller 
that combines a murder mys-
tery with some very contem-
porary comedy." Don't you

aforesaid elements, no~re as

him with Its share of both 

and triumphant consequences. 
During the 1960s. Moses W ioe 

(Richard Dreyfuss) was con-
sidered to be one of Berkeley's 
prize pupils of college rebellion. 
But these are the 1970s. and he 
has no time now to reflect upon 
the past. His revolutionary 
lifestyle long since replaced by 
a conservative. although 
barely substantial existence as 
a private investigator, Moses'

sufficient to try Moses ' pa-

." .... AcE m st. 

ODe of tile mo.t autbeDticaUy 
Americaa ...... ia that of the 
westerD fUm, aad the latest iD 
tbia style" AIaD J. Pakula's 
c.ner A HM'IeIIUUI. The film, 
bowever, instills lOme new life 
into the stock situations of the 
western and delivers a fresh 
and entertaining movie. 

Comes A Honeman bases Its 
plot on one of the most familiar 
classic western themes - - the 
individualistic and determined 
rancher who is struggling to 
survive against both nature and 
a greedy land baron. The film 
contains all the elem~nts 
essential to a western: a 
barroom brawl, a stampede, a 
villain, a beautiful landscape, 
and a faithful old companion. 

HUn ft" tbouP, adell some 
reIreabiDI twiata. The west .. 
DO loacer the old west of John 
Ford's weate..... bu\ rather 
Moatana at the end of World 
War II where old and new are 
stl'anlely uxtapoaed. Also the 
rancher is a tougb, defiant 
woman who is trying to save 
her ranch with the help of a 
partner and an old man. The 
movie also adds a quiet love 
story to the background. 

The movie successfully uses 
many new slants but it fails on 
other points. The major flaw is 
that the land baron pressuring 
the ranchers does not have 
enough presence and he is not a 
substantial rival although he 
displays a great amount of 
power. The blame for this lies 

maJDly In the rcript and the 
bland performance by Juon 
Robardlu the land baron. The 
film is allO hindered by a slow 
pace, and by a final sbowdown 
that somebow lacks a punch. 

The film, tbough, has many 
compensatin, factors, the 
biggest of which is the cast of 
{~ actors. Richard Farns-
worth as the faithful old cowboy 
is excellent and touching. 
James Caan (Caan actually 
competes professionally in 
rodeos and he does some of his 
own stunt work) as the ·ex-
soldier who wants to raise 
cattle does a nice, understated 
job. The centerpiece of the 
film, though, is Jane Fonda as 
the vulnerable yet resllent and 
determined rancher. The film

'Blood' 
Escapes 
Cliche 

By BeSII Aeeomaado 
BIoodIIro&ben 18 a film that 

requirer an audience to be 
patient because it starts on a 
heavy .... uded DOte which could 
turn an audience off . If, 
however, an audience liver the 
film a chance then they will be 
rewarded because BIoodIInUI-
en has a story worth hearing. 

Bioodbrodlen is about the 
twisted passions which afflict 
the DeCocoes, a blue collar, 
Italian-American family. They 
are hot-tempered, violent and 
loving; to them family love and 
loyalty are the most important 
part of life. At the center of all 
this suUocating affection is 
Stony, a young man on whom 
the hopes of the others ride. 
Tommy, Stony's father, has 
mapped out his son's life with 
loving care, but he has been 
blind to Stony's true needs and 
desires. At first Stony can't find 
either the strength or the desire 
to break these bonds, but 
eventually he chooses to step 
out on his own. Stony, as was 
the case with Tony Manero in 
Saturday Night Fever, is 
allowed to escape from the 
confines of his environment 
although in the novel he is 
engulfed by it. This opting for a 
happy ending is slightly un-
believeable but one is willing to 
accept it because Stony is a 
likeable man deserving of a 
break. 

Director Robert Mulligan 
and writer Walter Newman 
give the film a foundation in 
stereotypes such as the cliched 
macho image but they remedy 
this problem by eventually 
individualizing the characters 
and making them real. 

The film is also aided by 
excellent performers who 
inject their characters with an 
Intense vitality. Since the world 
of Bioocibrodlen is a male-
oriented one the quality per-
formances by the actresses are 
subordinated to those of the 
actors. Tony LoBianco as

'Comes ' a Time' for Neil Young 
By Mike 1'bomaa 

For montbJ the talk of tIM! 
music industry was that the 
new Nell Young album would 
be the one to reestablish him as 
a commercial commodity after 
his sojourn In the de8ert for the 
last five albums. After a near 
coronation by Paul NellOn'over 
his San Francisco concerts last 
spring in Rolllni Stone, the 

Nell 
YOUDg 

anticipation was high; the 
album was rumored to be 
arriving any week. 

Well, it's finally here and it's 
everything rumor had it to be, a 
commerical, slickly produced 
descendent of Harvest , 
Young's most anemic though 
biggest selling album. After 
Harvest Young threw it all 
away; that album, he says, 
" put me in the middle of the 
road . So I headed for the 
ditch .. .it was a rougher ride 
but I saw more interesting 
people there." He then re-
corded a triumvirate of the 
most anti-pretty, inaccessible 
yet brilliantly original albums 
made in the 1970s. In Time 
Fades Away, Tonight's The 
Night and On The Beach Young 
explored the dark side of the 
counter-culture that he had 
been so closely identified with 
at the turn of the decade. These 
three are not easy albums to 
listen to ; . they assault the 
audience, make no concessions 

to the marketplace and demand 
more than casual background 
listening. This dark trilogy was 
followed by Zuma, released in 
late '75, which was seen 81 a 
positive . return to the self-
motivation of his earlier work 
with the band Crazy Horse. 

Last year, he released Amer-
Ican Stars N' Bars, which was 
also widely praised, featuring 
two of his greatest songs, the 
ethereal "Will to Love" and the 
manic "Like A Hurricane." Yet 
still the mass audience he had 
deserted in order to live with his 
conscience refused to take 
notice . A greatest hits an-
thology, Decade, (the only 
justiCiable three recora com-
pilation I've ever encountered) 
beautifully documented this 
pilgrim's progress from youth-
ful innocence to mature ex-
perience, reflecting the times 
like no other artist in rock. But 
still the question must have 
nagged him: was ·anyone out 
there listening? 

Comes A TIme sets out to 
remedy that situation . It 's 
a bouncy, sugar-coated album, 
laced with strings and 
swamped by an army of acous-
tic guitarists . It is an in-
oHensive work that neither 
attacks the listener nor chal-
lenges any aesthetic consider-
ations about rock and roll. In its 
milder moments it resembles 
not so much Neil Young as John 
Denver. The album is not 
without its highlights, however. 
The tiUe tune to his in-progress 
second film , "Human High-
way," is finally on wax after. 5 
years, the tension of "Look-
out for My Love" and the 
melancholy beauty of " Already 
One" are haunting, and the title 
cut is a great number to square 
dance to. Yet pleasant as the 
album is, it keeps setting you up 
for a big moment that never 
arrives. There is no epic 
resolution here comparable to 
" Cortez the Killer" or " Am-

'Eight' Album' 
CODlDlercial Pop 

By Stuart Leavenworth 
If you are getting sick of 

commercial albums such as the 
latest efforts by Boston and 
Foreigner, then get ready to 
puke some more, Styx has 
come out with· Pieces of Eipt. 

Except for a few of the 
performances by songwriterl 
vocalistl guitarist Tommy 
Shaw, Styx could do nothing 
right on this album. The music, 
the lyrics, the production and 
even the album cover are 
repulsive. the latter showing 
close-ups of wrinkle-faced 
ladies with small megaliths 

hanging from their earlobes. 
The classic Styx blend of 

. guitar, keyboards and vocal 
. harmonies is still evident on 
Pieces of Ell", but all the 
originality of their last three 
albums has vanished. Side one 
starts out with a raunchy song 
called "The Great White 
Hope," and then Wllows with 
"I'm O.K.", which has nothing 
to offer except for a cranky 
guitar solo by Shaw. "Song for 
the Day" is one of the better 
tunes on the album, but would 
only be filler on one of Styx's 
earlier packages.

bulance Blues" or "Like a' 
Hurricane." There is nothing 
threatening about this music; it 
neither poses questions nor 
gropes for solutions, which is 
precisely what the best of 
Young's work does do. Here he 
is simply marking time as 
Hillbilly Neil, pickin' and 
grinnin' some tunes fer ya . It' )) 
probably be his biggest-selling 
work in ages and he certainly 
deserves the attention, but not 
for this album.

would be fatuous, for I know 
nothinJ of the relative qualities 
of European string quartets, 
but for a 'Viennese critic to 
write the above of a chamber 
music group is truly amaziDl· 
The quartet will render tbNe 
pieces by Mozart, Janeclt and 
Smetena.

pany will perform a repertoire 
which .. takes off from a 
classical foundation and sud-
denly reverses gears, blunting 
that impulse toward controlled 
abandon with stymb contor-
OOl1S." This description, taken 
from an article by New York 
Timet drama critic Jermlfer 
Dunning, iI a little bit equivocal 
and uninformative, but ODe 
phrase sticks out .trancely: 
"that ImpulJe." The expreuion 
of "that impulse," the impulse 
toward perfection, the evan-
escent sublime in human 
movement, is perhaps the 8OU1 
of the dance, whatever the 
form. And Poain cbol'eOlJ'Bpils 
many forms, from orderly 
Bach adaptations to Space-Ale 
disco fantasies. Her company 
and herself come to us very 
bighly recommended.

anything about the National

Brothers 
(Continued from Dage8) 
Tommy blends the right 
amount of proud love with 
uncontrollable violence to 
create a portrait of a man who 
can't express love without 
hurting those he loves . As 
Tommy's brother Chubby, 
Paul Sorvino is a rare and 
welcomed pleasure. Sorvino is 
an actor with a wide range and 
abundant talent but his screen 
appearances are far too f~ . 

. The centerpiece of the film is 
the wonderful performance by 
Richard Gere as Stony. Gere, 
who is also in Looking for Mr. 
Goodbar and Day. of Heav.en, 
is a very promiSing new talent. 
He has an attractive and 
sensitive screen presence 
wblch is perfectly suited to his 
role. 

Bloodbro&bers dea Is with 
violent passions which confine 
people or which force people to 
seek escape. The film takes on 
the intensely emotional nature 
of its characters and creates an 
environment where love hurts. 
Bloodbro&hers, despite its 
flaws, is a movie well worth 
vlewln,.

Food 
Fight 
(Continued from page 5) 
Revelle student Mile Arnold, 
who had just sat down after 
paying cash to get in, was 
struck above the eye with a salt 
shaker. An uilidentified female 
student was also hit, this time 
by a plate that broke. on her 
shoulder, leaving her bruised. 
It was then, Edwin said, that 
the window was broken as a 
student attempted to escape out 
an emergency exit door. The 
student's name was taken and 
he will be fined, Edwin said. 

As for the rest of the dam-
ages, a decision whether to 
charge the entire body of 
Revelle residents or just those 
known to be involved will not be 
made until late next week, 
Edwin and Barrett said. This 
will allow them . and Revelle 
Dean Ernie Mort an oppor-
tunity to explore their legal 
options and ,ather input from 
students on the RCCA, HPA, 
and Housing and Food Services 
Committee, as well as Revelle 
RAs. A better estimate of the 
damages will also be available 
then, Edwin said . Until all the 
information is in, there is the 
possibility of charging students 
not involved with the food right, 
fo:dwin concluded.

Gay Rights, Smoking, Death Penalty 

Three Propositions Attract Interest 
(Coatl.aed from pale I) 
of Proposition 6 have been able 
to agree on what those terms 
mean. 

rinnsand the Tobacco Iristitute 
- avoid talking about the rights 
of smokers. . 

Their campaign is focused 
instead on Proposition 5 as 

panies "would be'd subject for 
psychiatric evaluation were 
they not contributing" to the 
campaign to defeat the pro-
posed smoking restrictions . 

a policeman. 
Proposition 7 adds a wide 

range of new categories , 
including murder of a state or 
federal official , judge or 

percent of the voters support 
capital punishment, a ration 
that gives neither side much 
incentive to work to change the 
outcome . 

Other Measur .. 
Early in the campaign, 

Briggs said that phrase would 
cover any teacher or counselor 
who portrayed the homosexual 
lifestyle as an acceptable 
alternative. Lately he has 
softened that stance and said 
they would apply only to 
someone who was "pushing 
homoaexuaUty'" in the class-
room. 

Prop 7 Would Cause Sharp 
Upsurge in Death Penalty 

The 'other ballot measures, 
all placed before voters by 
large bipartisan majorities in 
the Legislature, are: 

- Proposition I , the self-
financed $500 million bond issue 
to continue the Cal-Vet home 
loan program. 

But Lelblative Counsel Bion 
Gregory said in a formal 
opinion that the .. advocacy" 
provlalon could be Interpreted 
to cover a teacher who merely 
campaipa qaiDst Propoation 
6. Thus, be said, the Initiative 
was UDCODBtitutioaaUy vague 
and also abrictced the rilht of 
free speecb. 

Brigp rejected that aaaly-
sis, saying the me8lUJ'e appUed 
ooly to actiona taken after It 
passed, and that no school 
board or court would allow a 
firinl that violated f~speecb 
rights. 

But the issue bas shifted the 
focus of the campaign some-
what from the rights of homo-
sexuals to the authority of the 
state to regulate ideas, and has 
allowed opponents to raise the 
specter of a McCarthy-style 
witchhunt. 

Proposition 5: 
Smoking 

another infringement by gov-
ernment on the rights of 
individuals, and it is built on the 
slogan, "They're at it again," 
which attempts to tap the 
public frustration with govern-
ment exhibited in the landslide 
victory of the Proposition 13 tax 
cut initiative last June. 

·The No OD5 commercials alao 
ridicule the detailed exemp-
tiona from the proposed smok-
ing controls, such as one 
allowing smoking at rock 
concerts, but prohibiting it at 
jazz concerts. 

Backei'll of Proposition 5 have 
also attempted to make an 
issue of something not in the 
measure - the spending by 
their opponents. 

Supporters of 5 say they have 
raiseq a Uttle over $300,000 -
less than one-tenth the money 
of their opponents. Tbe ratio of 
spending for television ad-
vertising is about 200-1. If the 
initiative loses, whatever its

Suppo~rs of Pr~posltJon 5 election," says Paul Loveday, a 
ca~1 theIr mea~ure t~e ,~am- drafter of Proposition 5 and

their campaign is built on the No-on-5 spokesman Jack 
right o( nonsmokers not to be McDowen tobacco com-
subjected against their will to

selves . 

.. Although smokers have a 
right to smoke, when that right 
conflicts with the right to 
breathe clean air, the riJht to 
breathe clean air takes prece-
dence," Propollition 5 sup-
porten say. 

"Right now the smoker bas 
more options than the non-
smoker, He has 'the choice to 
smoke or not smoke. But once 
he lights up, the nonsmoker 
doesn't have the choice o( 
breathing or not breathing the 
smoke," the Yes on 5 campaign 
says. 

Foes of five - financed 
largely by five major tobacco 

presents 

Samuel Beckett's

But he says more than 1,300 
persons oot connected with the 
industry have also contributed. 

Another issue in dispute is the 
ads' repeated reference to 
arrests. Loveday says there 
won't be arrests under the 
initiative, and even the $50 fine 
it requires will be rarely 
imposed; McDowell disagrees. 

The ads al80 regularly cite a 
tobacco industry-financed 
study sayine the measure will 
cost gov~mmeDt $43 million a 
year for no-smoking signs and 
enforcement. State Legislative 
Analyst William Hamm con· 
tends the cost will be no more 
than $l.l million and could be 
much less. 

Proposition 7: 
Death Penalty 

Another proposition that had 
the potential for an emotion-
al, bitterly contested election is 
the death penalty initiative. But 
it hasn 't turned out that way. 

Proposition 7, another in-
itiative sponsored by Briggs. 
greatly expands application of 
California'S new death penalty · 
law, which is now limUed to 17 
narrowly defined Situations, 
such as murder for hire , 
multiple murder and murder of

prosecutor, murder "while 
lying in wait" and murder by 
poison. It also says anyone who 
is not present but aids the 
murderer can be ordered 
executed by a jury. 

Two factors appear to have 
stified interest in Proposition 7. 
One is a lack of a really clear 
black-or-white alternative. The 
Legislature re-enacted the 
death penalty last August over 
Brown's veto, although there 
have not yet been any execu-
tions under the new law. 

Therefore it is not the prin-
ciple of capital punishment, but 
rather how it will be applied, 
that is at stake. 

The 1977 law was so narrowly 
drawn that it is likely to affect 
only a few dozen murderers 
each year, while Proposition 7 
could result in hundreds of 
death sentences annually. But 
that dWerence in potential 
impact has sparked very little 
excitemellt among either foes 
or supporters of capital punish-
ment. 

The other factor quashing 
activity either (or or against 
Proposition 7 is that there 
seems to be very little doubt 
about the outcome. 

Various polls show 73 to 85 

-Proposition 2, which would 
repeal a current law allowing 
the Public Utilities Commis-
sion to assign hearings to a 
single commissioner. 

- Proposition 3, which would 
let the state sell surplus coastal 
property for farmland pres-
ervation, parks or wildlife 
habitat. 

- Proposition 4, which would 
revise licensing standards for 
chiropractors.

in a while we can have joint 
workouts. These are very 
motivating for the girls." 

Lack of commitment from 
the athletes is the biuest 
problem facing Dann. "Last 
year 1 was too lenient about 
attendance at practices and 
meets. We always came up 
short for the big meets. Lots of 
times we couldn't even get 
together enough people for a 
relay team." 

This year Dann has cracked 
down. "I know It's hard to ask 
for a full, 100% commitment to 
swimming," she acknowl-

ever. I nl*!d a core of swim-
mers who are willing to be there 
at practices and meets, willing 
to work hard." 

Dann has personally ar-
ranged all the meets for her 
team this season because at 
present time there is no league 
for UCSD in women's swim-
ming. ' 

"Our big rival is Pomona-
Pitzer who we swim against on 
December 2. Last year we 
crushed them and they were 
upset. 1 hope we can do it again 
this year," she added.

goal. "He's one of the less 
respected refs," reported 
coach Stewart Hayes after the 
game. "He's not in good shape. 
If only he were 20 yards closer 
to that play. he could have 
called it right." 

UCSD fared even worse the 
next day. upping their strinR of 
losses to six straight by losing 
to Cal State Long Beach 5-1. 

Before the game, Hayes told 
his players that "we don ' t have 
to score. They can score for 
us. " And sure enough, a LOlli 
Beach back headed the ball to 
his goalie. but the ball went past 
him for a goal.
