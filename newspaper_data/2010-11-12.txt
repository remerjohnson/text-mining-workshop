The suspect  accused of killing 
the woman whose body was found 
in a burning vehicle pleaded not 
guilty to charges of murder and 
arson yesterday.

Deputy District Attorney Nicole 
Cooper of the San Diego Superior 
Court alleged that 50-year-old Julio 
Angel Garcia-Puente killed his 38-year-
old wife Lorena Gonzalez on Oct. 29, 
when her body was found in a burning 
SUV at the parking lot next to UCSD’s 
baseball field.

Cooper said the defendant 
destroyed evidence by burning the 
body of the victim.

After launching plans to pur-
chase an  AM radio tower last 
Spring Quarter, student-run radio 
station KSDT is now looking into 
purchasing a FM station. 

“It’s a more feasible option,” 
KSDT General Manager Meredith 
Wong said. “FM is not as likely, but 
it would be better.”

With the help of a consultant 
from a non-profit organization 
called Common Frequency, KSDT 
identified an FM station near 
campus that has recently stopped 
broadcasting. The FM station is not 
currently for sale, but KSDT hopes 
to purchase it if it becomes available 
in the future. 

“We couldn’t find an AM signal 
and then the FM possibility came 
up,” KSDT Operations Manager 
Anabel De La Parra said. “Because 
of the nature of getting a radio 
signal, it’s hard to get one that’s not 
already taken and that broadcasts 
here in the area. So now we are 
really just waiting to see if they are 

going to sell the signal.”
Consultant Todd Urick — who 

found the FM radio station and will 
help with its purchase — is provid-
ing assistance free of charge until 
KSDT acquires the frequency.

Wong said a FM frequency 
would take less work to put together 
since KSDT would have a tower and 
an open frequency instead of need-
ing to purchase a $100,000 tower. 
The station is working on obtaining 
a license.  

According to Wong, the sound 
quality of an AM frequency is not 
as good as an FM frequency. 

FM frequencies are in higher 
demand by music stations because 
of superior sound quality. She said 
they also cost more and are regu-
lated more extensively.

Currently, KSDT is an Internet 
radio station accessible at www.
ksdt.ucsd.edu, or downloadable on 
iTunes.

Wong said that if KSDT obtains 
an FM frequency, its content would 
focus on the UCSD community

Five pieces of the Loft’s art col-
lection were stolen on Friday, Nov. 
5, days before they were scheduled 
to the shipped back to the curator 
of the collection. 

According to Loft Curator 
Elizabeth Bradshaw, the pieces were 
taken from the University Events 
Office on the fourth floor of Price 
Center East.

“On Friday, the artwork was 
packaged up in boxes, ready to 
be shipped back to the curator,”

Next Tuesday, the UC Board of Regents will vote on whether to pass an 8-percent fee increase. The increase was proposed by 
UC President Mark G. Yudof in an open letter to 
California on Nov. 8.  If approved, the fees will be 
implemented in the 2012-13 academic year.

Yudof ’s proposal would raise the UC system’s fees 
by $822, bringing them from $10,302 to $11,124. He 
also proposed that student service fees increase by $72 
to become $972. 

Last November, the Regents approved a heavily 
protested 32-percent student fee increase that was 
implemented in two phases. Fees increased by $585 
during Spring Quarter 2010 and $1,344 this fall, 
though services fees were not affected. Then-Student 
Regent Jesse Bernal was the sole dissenting vote.

Yudof said the fee increases are necessary to 
ensure the university’s survival. 

“I don’t increase fees lightly,” he said in an news 
briefing in Oakland, Calif. on Monday. “But we need 
to do what we need to do so the greatest public uni-
versity in the world continues along its historic trajec-
tory in serving the people of California.”

Yudof ’s proposal also outlines an expanded finan-
cial aid plan. He said a third of the revenue from fee 
increases, or about $116 million, would be used for 
financial aid. Under the plan, families with annual 
income under $80,000 will have all fees paid by the 
university. Families with income under $120,000 will 
not pay fees for the first year the increases are imple-
mented. This means that 45 percent of the university’s 
181,000 students will pay   these additional fees. UC 

Berkeley senior Sameer Khan, chair of the university’s 
student-based Council of Student Fees, called the pro-
posal “intolerable” in a statement released Monday.

“The administration must find another way to 
fund the university, as students and their parents are 
shouldering too big of a financial burden already,” he 
wrote. “Despite the negative impact of any form of fee 
increase, the added funds  in the student service fee 
may potentially allow each campus to cut fewer of the 

services that are vital to students.”
A.S. Vice President of External Affairs Michael 

Lam is planning a protest to be held at the Chancellor’s 
Complex on Nov. 18. 

“Students have the power when we come togeth-
er,” Lam said.

KeyÊAtmosphereÊDiscoveriesÊProvideÊInsightÊtoÊLifeÊonÊMars
SCIENCEÊANDÊTECHNOLOGY

By Justin Kauker
Contributing Writer

While NASA robots have been dig-
ging and drilling to collect rock on 
Mars, a team of UCSD scientists say 
the real action is in the air. Dust may 
contain the secrets to life on Mars and 
other planets.

Researchers have discovered chem-
ical reactions that occur on the surface 
of carbonate particles in the atmo-
sphere. These particles could give us 
insight into how life begins on a planet.

One basic requirement of life is 
large organic molecules. For these to 
form naturally, scientists thought two 
important conditions were necessary: 
lots of water and lots of time. Water 
so that chemicals like ammonia and 
methane can float around, and time so 
that they can bump into each other and 
create chemical reactions that are the 
first signs of life. But Robina Shaheen, a 
postdoctoral associate that worked on 
the project, said her research shows that 
all you might need is a little water and 
some mineral dust.

The research’s principle investiga-

tor and biochemistry professor Mark 
Thiemen said the thin layer of water 
surrounding dust particles creates a 
previously unknown environment, 
where chemical reactions can occur 
very quickly. The new environment 
created by the interaction of dust par-
ticles and water means that the chemi-
cals that need to bump into each other 
are going faster, and are more likely to 
collide and form organic molecules.

Shaheen said the reaction can go so 
quickly that carbonate, a type of min-
eral that usually takes days to weeks to 
form, could form in as little as seconds. 

Since the discovery of carbonate 
in Martian meteorites, many scientists 
took it a sign of life on Mars. Here on 
Earth, calcium carbonate is produced 
by creatures in the ocean as shells and 
later deposited as sedimentary rock. 

Animals like snails and tiny plank-
ton can make carbonate very quickly 
because they use complex biochemis-
try. Shaheen showed that fast forma-
tion of carbonate doesn’t need bio-
chemistry. It can occur on the surface 
of dust grains in the atmosphere.

“The whole trick is rate,” Theimen 

said. “You have to goose the rate. For 
hundreds of years, we’ve understood 
how reactions occur in water [but] all 
these rules go away when you’re on the 
surface of a particle.”

Shaheen said the team began by 
studying how aerosol pollutants move 
from one place to another. But once 
her team analyzed some samples they 
saw new chemistry they didn’t expect. 
Carbonate was being formed on the 
particles. The problem was no one 
knew what was happening in the air.

The team used oxygen isotope 17 
to track the formation of carbonate 
in the particles. When they compared 
that with the formation of carbonate 
in a Martian meteorite, Thiemen said 
they found strong similarities.

The findings have implications 
closer to home. Shaheen said that by 
understanding the composition of 
aerosols in our own environment we 
come closer to figuring out patterns 
of rain and snowfall.

“It’s important for the Earth over-
all from a climate change perspec-
tive,” Shaheen said.

Pollutant could absorb more solar 

radiation depending on the reactions 
that occur on their surface, Shaheen 
explained. If they got into snow it 
could cause snow pack to melt faster, 
disrupting access to water for many 
people. She hopes that using this new 
technique to analyze aerosols will 
help others determine how pollu-
tion is directly impacting hydrologic 
cycles.

AS PER USUAL By Dami Lee

CLOSED QUARTERS By Kat Truong



NEWSÊ FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 2010Ê THE UCSD GUARDIAN 3 

Last night’s meeting began with a cash-strapped A.S. Council approving a temporary freeze 
on pulling money from its mandate 
reserves.

The freeze will prevent the council 
from tapping into the reserve funds, 
as they have been doing this quarter. 
For example, on 
Oct. 27 they pulled 
$32,153 from 
mandate reserves 
to fund Triton 
Television.

A.S. President 
Wafa Ben Hassine 
said a large portion 
of the reserves was used to pay off 
debt from the Grove Café, a student-
run business council shut down last 
year.

“We’ve been pulling from our 
mandate reserves too much,” Ben 
Hassine said. “We have been exceed-
ing our real bandwidth, so to speak.”

Official business was unusu-
ally light, and the floor was quickly 
opened up for special presentations.

Associate Vice President of 
Student Advocacy Arohi Sharma 
gave a presentation about how the 
office helps students who have run 
afoul of academic integrity rules. 
Sharma worked the room with all the 
energy of infomercial saleswoman, 
skipping across the Forum to hand 
out prizes to councilmembers who 
answered her quiz correctly. She used 
a scene from the short film “Busted: 
A Citizen’s Guide to Surviving Police 
Encounters” to address the need for 
students to know their rights. Busted 
is a dime-budget educational movie 
complete with aggressive police, a 
reckless stoner and an innocent girl 
caught in the middle.

Sharma’s tone turned serious 
when she addressed the council about 
the revised Student Code of Conduct.

“I would deeply, deeply encourage 
all of you to seriously read the new 
code that’s being proposed because 
it is scary,” Sharma said. “It’s scary in 
terms that it is very over-broad, very 
vague, very ambiguous.”

Warren College Senator Mac 
Zilber asked the council to rethink 

the election pro-
cess for senators. 

“A lot of [our 
electoral process-
es], from the per-
spective of some-
body who studies 
electoral structure, 
are incredibly 

janky,” Zilber said.
He explained that the elections use 

a model called At-Large Plurality. In 
this model, eight votes for senator 
must be used on eight different people. 
Zilber proposed a system of cumula-
tive voting, where all eight votes could 
be used on any candidate. If the vot-
ers wanted, they could use all eight 
votes for one candidate, or split them 
however they choose. He also recom-
mended randomizing the name order 
of candidates on each ballot.

The meeting closed with Vice 
President of External Affairs Michael 
Lam showing a video of students 
protesting in the United Kingdom. 
Crowds of students pushed against 
British police officers as a few rocks 
and bottles sailed through the air.  

Once the lights went up, Associate 
Vice President of Local Affairs 
Matthew Vu announced that stu-
dent fees had tripled. The presenta-
tion was a rebuke to UC President 
Mark Yudof ’s proposed 8-percent fee 
increase. 

“Students have the power when 
we come together,” Lam said.

Vu ended the meeting by 
announcing a fee increase protest at 
the Chancellor’s Complex on Nov. 18.

UCSD is partnering with two 
local businesses to build a power 
plant on campus.

The university is working with 
Connecticut-based FuelCell Energy 
and local corporation BioFuels 
Energy to create three of the world’s 
largest fuel cells. 

Fuel cells, a type of power plant, 
are an alternative source of energy 
that generate energy without com-
bustion. This prevents pollutants 
from being expelled into the air. 

One fuel cell produces 2.8 mega-
watts, enough energy to power over 
2,000 homes per hour. UCSD will 
be installing one of these 2.8-mega-
watt plants, while the other two — a 
1.4-megawatt and a 300-kilowatt fuel 
cell —  will be installed in the South 
Bay Water Reclamation Plant and 
Point Loma Wastewater Treatment 
Plant, respectively.

“By the end of 2011, UCSD will 
be the only university that will hold 
the largest commercially available 
fuel cell in the world,” Director 
of Strategic Energy Initiatives at 
UCSD Byron Washom said. “Fuel 
cell technology and research, as of 
today, is small and so the partner-
ship with both FuelCell Energy and 
BioFuels Energy is that much more 
important.”

The project will cost $45 million 
in total, of which $17 million will go 
toward the fuel cell plant on cam-
pus. The $17 million will be funded 
by federal grants. 

Washom said the fuel cell will 
improve the campus’ self-generation 
of electricity, though he is waiting on 
statistical confirmation. The location 
of the fuel cell will be finalized in 
about two weeks.

Currently, UCSD generates elec-
tricity through solar panels installed 
on over 26 UCSD buildings, like the 
newly built East Campus Energy 

Complex near the baseball fields, 
Gilman Parking Structure and atop 
Price Center. The university receives 
83 percent of electricity from these 
solar panels, which will grow to 90 
percent by December 2011. There 
is also an established 30-megawatt 
natural gas power plant. 

The on-campus cell will use puri-
fied methane   from the local Point 
Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant 
as the primary fuel source. Methane 
is a bio gas that contributes to global 
warming. 

“The Point Loma plant currently 
expels about 1.3 million cubic feet of 
methane gas into the atmosphere a 
day, and being able to convert such 
toxic gas into clean energy through 
non-combustion fuel cells will be 
very efficient for large institutions 
like UCSD,” BioFuels Energy manag-
ing director Frank Mazanec said.

According to Mazanec, the green-
house gas methane is 22 times more 
detrimental to the atmosphere than 
carbon dioxide. The cell will purify 
the bio gas on site and then inject it 
into the San Diego Gas and Electric 
pipelines, which will directly feed 
into the assembled fuel cells at UCSD 
and the other two proposed sites in 
San Diego.

The plan is different from previ-
ous plans that called for methane 
to be transported in pressurized gas 
tankers from Point Loma. This pro-
posal was rejected by Point Loma 
residences because it risked the safety 
of homes en route of the tankers.

“Fuel cell technology is the green 
technology of the future,” FuelCell 
Energy Southern California sales rep-
resentative Phong Nguyen said. “The 
key to the efficiency of this technol-
ogy lies in a constant stream of fuel 
to these cells, which is accomplished 
by the methane pipelines installed 
directly from the Point Loma plant.”

Nguyen said he hopes the three 
fuel cell power plants installed in San 
Diego will eliminate the emission 

of over 68,100 pounds of pollutants 
produced from treatment and power 
plants annually.

“That is like removing over 2,000 
cars from the road per year,” Nguyen 
said.

The 2.8-megawatt fuel cell will 
supply power to the campus electrical 
grid. On-site power generation will 
also allow the university to control its 
own power supply and energy out-
puts and provides electrical power 24 
hours a day with the fuel cell.

“This step is imperative if UCSD 
desires to reduce costs of generation 
of electricity,” Mazanec said. “With 
the fuel cells in place, the univer-
sity can literally control its own des-
tiny and save over $500,000 of energy 
costs per year.”

Washom said the project can set a 
precedent for green energy.

“If this project does indeed suc-
ceed, we can apply the fuel cell 
technology to many municipalities 
around the world,” Washom said. 
“We can use the readily available 
methane producing wastewater treat-
ment plants coupled with these fuel 
cells to help create self-sufficient 
power around the world.”

He added that there should 
be more student involvement in 
investigating alternative sources of 
energy. 

Currently, there are student-run 
projects that try to find renewable 
energy sources by analyzing algae 
and its potential to help create elec-
tricity.  Other projects investigate the 
validity of using vegetable oil as a 
means of alternative energy.

“Student involvement in alterna-
tive energy solutions research, which 
is readily available at UCSD, will 
not only look good on the student 
resume, but also help them learn a lot 
about our current energy problems,” 
Washom said.

The University of California’s 
academic student employees — such 
as teaching assistants, tutors and 
graduate student instructors —  are 
negotiating with administration for 
higher wages, increased child care 
subsidies and timely notifications of 
job offers. 

The student employees are repre-
sented by the United Auto Workers 
Local 2865. In Spring Quarter 2010, 
UAW  filed an unfair labor prac-
tices suit with the UC Office of the 
President in an attempt to reach 
a contract for the aforementioned 
provisions.

 “[We have] near poverty wages 
and we do the bulk of the teach-
ing,” UAW media coordinator Erin 
Ellison said. “They are asking us to 
take an effective pay cut.”

Legally, workers can strike 
because of the unfair labor practices 
suit and the fact that they work with-
out a contract. The UC Office of the 
President and UAW met on Tuesday, 
Nov. 9 to continue negotiations.

Ellison, who is a teaching assis-
tant at UC Santa Cruz, is working 

with a grassroots campaign  unaf-
filiated with the UAW. This group 
is using a petition to ask for a pay 
increase and tell UCOP what the 
members want to see in the new 
contract. 

“David Selby [recording secre-
tary for the San Diego UAW Local 
2865] presented to the council about 
four weeks ago and gave us the status 
of union negotiations to that point.” 
Graduate Student Association Vice 
President Nicholas Sanez said. 

The petition is signed by nearly 
650 graduate student instructors, 
readers, tutors and TAs, 22 of which 
are from UCSD. The petition claims 
that the current pay increase offer of 
2 percent is lower than the expected 
cost of living expenses. 

The petition also asked for col-
lective bargaining power for the 
workers. Seanz said the UC system 
does not want the academic student 
employees to be involved in the con-
tract process at the bargaining table.  

Ellison said he is concerned with 
job security and job appointments. 
According to Ellison, one TA was 
dropped as a TA after a week and 
often TAs will not know of their 
appointment or even if they have a 

job until within a week or less before 
the class begins. 

She also said the UC system is 
hypocritical with its spending and 
does not provide proficient money 
for child care.

“It’s pretty clear the hypocrisy and 
lack of priority 
in their prac-

“It would be a resource on cam-

pus to use as a communication tool,” 
Wong said. 

KSDT also hopes to expand by 
implementing online video stream-
ing, as well as iPod application soft-
ware that would be written by the 
station’s sound engineers. These 
new aspects would enable perform-
ers to reach a larger audience since 
they are new outlets through which 
students can reach the audience. 

“We’re trying to make KSDT 
more smartphone-compatible and 
interactive,” Wong said. 

KSDT Sound Engineer Eli 
Pechman said these new features 
would be beneficial to the station’s 
popularity.

“We are trying to change our 
function a little,” Pechman said. 
“Right now, we are strictly an 
Internet radio station, and lots of 
people who listen to us are not nec-
essarily connected with the school. 
The new features would be outlets 
for students to expose themselves to 
a bigger audience.”

The KSDT managers do not 
know how much it would cost 
to purchase a FM frequency.

Judge Richard Whitney has set the 
bail amount at $1 million and sched-
uled a status conference for Nov. 22 to 
determine the date of the preliminary 
trial.

“There is the preliminary hearing, 
which is like a mini-trial to determine 
if probable cause exists to show that 
the suspect committed the crime and 
if the case should proceed to trial,” San 
Diego Police Department’s Lt. Kevin 
Rooney said. “Or there’s always a pos-
sibility a suspect will enter a plea prior 
to a trial. It really depends on the 
defendant, the attorney and whatever 
decision they make to fight it to trial 
or not.” 

If convicted, Garcia-Puente will 
face 26 years to life in prison.

On Tuesday, Nov. 9, the medical 
examiner’s office identified the female 
body as a Carlsbad resident Gonzalez, 
who is the registered owner of the 
burning vehicle.

Rooney said the cause of death will 
be disclosed at a later time.

“The autopsy reported has not 
been completed by the doctor who 
performed the autopsy,” he said. “In 
the meantime, we are going to contin-
ue keeping any documents the medi-
cal examiner’s office has prepared 
sealed. We’re not going to reveal [the 
cause of death] just yet.”

Neither the woman nor her 
estranged husband were UCSD stu-
dents.

“There was never any link estab-
lished between the victim and the 
university,” Rooney said. 

SDPD have been looking for 
Garcia-Puente since Nov. 1. On Nov. 

5, Mexican law enforcement located 
Garcia-Puente in the Otay neighbor-
hood of Tijuana.

Garcia-Puente voluntarily returned 
to the United States and detectives 
arrested him at the San Ysidro Port 
of Entry.

“We developed what we call prob-
able cause, [which is] sufficient evi-

dence to arrest 
him,” Rooney 
said. “The dis-
trict attorney 
agrees and they 
are charging 
him with mur-
der and arson.”

R o o n e y 
said Garcia-
Puente is a not 
a U.S. citizen. 

“He’s a 
M e x i c a n 
national, he’s 
not a citizen 
of the United 
States,” Rooney 

said. “He agreed to return to the 
United States. So he crossed the bor-
der down San Ysidro court, we met 
him and there’s federal process for 
getting someone back into the United 
States who’s not a citizen. We were able 
to facilitate that and get him back into 
the United States. We met with the 
man and ultimately arrested him.”

A San Marcos church called Templo 
Cristiano Alpha y Omega Church will 
hold a memorial service for Gonzalez 
on Saturday, Nov. 13 at 5 p.m.

Bradshaw said. “It then came to 
light — while preparing for an 
event on Sunday — that a few pieces 
were missing.” 

The pieces were valued at 
around $200-$600 each, and were 
in a 12-inch-by-12-inch frames. 
The framed sign describing the 
pieces was also missing. 

The Loft is currently working 
with nearby departments and orga-
nization, such as A.S. Council, to 
determine information about the 
missing artwork. 

“We are looking for the safe 
return of the pieces,” Bradshaw said. 
“That is the primary concern.”

She requested that if anyone with 
information about the details of the 

artwork should inform University 
Centers, or to return the artwork to 
the A.S. reception area of the fourth 
floor of Price Center. 

“No questions will be asked,” 
Bradshaw said. “We just ask for the 
safe return of these pieces.”

EDITORIALÊBOARD

The UCSD Guardian is published twice a week at 
the University of California at San Diego. Contents 

© 2010. Views expressed herein represent the 
majority vote of the editorial board and are not 

necessarily those of the UC Board of Regents, the 
ASUCSD or the members of the Guardian staff. 

Ever since YouTube caught on 
to our secret that refreshing the 
page allowed us to skip their ads 
(too smart for their own good), 
I’ve had to sit through commercials 
for everything from cell phones to 
senators when all I want is to watch 
Willow Smith whip her hair back 
and forth.

It was during one of these forced 
viewing periods that I noticed 
Carly Fiorina’s ad, encouraging 
Californians to support her in a 
now-failed bid for U.S. Senate. For 
those of you who haven’t had to sit 
through the longest 30 seconds of 
your life, it goes like this:

Fifty-six-year-old Fiorina, 
impeccably coiffed and with glow-
ingly flawless skin, makes steady 
(and sparkling) eye contact with 
the viewer as she tells him or her a 
simple message: Vote for me. I can 
change.

The thing that struck me about 
this ad — especially when faced 
with the results of a Google image 
search — is that the Fiorina I know 
doesn’t look like the 30-year-old 
Neutrogena model on my screen. 
Fiorina, actually looks like she could 
be my grandmother. She has the 
wrinkles that befit someone her age 
— here she went through a lot of 
trouble, probably including postpro-
duction airbrushing and several lay-
ers of coverup, not to show them. 

Of course, she’s not the first to 
go to extreme lengths to clean up 
for television. The bright lights and 
media scrutiny of the modern age 
— as well as the Hollywood stan-
dards of attractiveness that people 
hold for anyone who appears on 
a TV screen — mean stepping up 
your visual game if you want to stay 
ahead. Politicians have drawn huge 
criticism for spending thousands of 
dollars pruning and preening them-
selves. 

Sarah Palin may have gotten in 
trouble for paying almost $33,000 
for her makeup and hair over the 
course of her vice presidential 
campaign, and let’s not forget, John 
McCain spent $5,500 on makeup 
during the 2008 campaign season, 
John Edwards’ infamous $1,250 
haircut; former British Prime 
Minister Tony Blair spent £1800, — 
$2,888, for those non-UK among us 
— on makeup. 

But before we grill our world 
leaders for being shallow or poke 
fun at them for wearing a three-
inch-thick matte non-shine mask, 
we should remember that harsh TV 
studio lighting, combined with the 
pore magnifying effect of high defi-
nition, can make any swan look like 
an ugly duckling. 

Research from the Journal of 
Public Economics showed that vot-
ers are subconsciously swayed by 
better looking candidates. Subjects 
in the study were asked to rank the 
attractiveness of politicians along 
with their perceived intellect, com-
petence, credibility and friendliness. 
The results showed that a point 
increase in a candidates’s perceived 
attractiveness correlated with sig-
nificant increases in his or her per-
ceived leadership qualities.

When You Leave it All Online, 
Quality is the First to Go 

By taking away the real-world experience that makes going to class 
worthwhile, digital degrees will fall short of  UC standards.

We can all agree that the Internet has made life 
easier. Forget about going to the library for your 
paper on Nietzche, or making the trek to UTC for 
this winter’s must-haves. Hell, you don’t even need 
to leave the comfort of your own room for some 
one-on-one time with Jenna Jameson. 

But while the Internet is perfect for look-
ing up how to deep fry a turkey, there is a dif-
ference between a recipe and a chem lab, no 
matter how hard our Regents try to bridge that 
gap. On Nov. 2, the UC Office of the President 
announced that it is taking the first steps toward 
a UC online degree program that will hopefully 
offer a “UC-quality” education. And though some 
online classes are already offered through the 
UC Extension program, the UC system will have 
to upgrade its thinking caps if it wants to create 
a cyberspace version of our esteemed university 
that’s up to standard.

While online universities like the University of 
Phoenix and Kaplan University have successfully 
created online degree programs for everything 
from an associates degree to a PhD, there’s no 
question that a UCSD degree has more weight 
than a University of Phoenix B.A.

In all fairness, some departments like political 
science and literature could transition to an online 
format without a drastic loss of quality. Given the 
opportunity, we’re already more likely to skip out 
on our poli sci lecture in favor listening to the 
professor’s podcasted analysis of Malcom X from 
the living room couch. 

But, things like live discussions can’t be dupli-
cated online. Sure, some students could use dis-
cussion boards like the ones on WebCT or e-mail 
their professors with questions, but no amount 
of e-mailing or posting can replace personal face 
time with a professor or TA. 

A major draw of the UC system is that it offers 
students the chance to work with award-winning 
faculty — your UC degree means that you have 
been face to face with a literature professor who 
won a Pulitzer Prize, or the man who pioneered 
bioluminescent nanotechnology. Sacrificing that 
for online convenience compromises the quality of 
education.

Aside from losing valuable educational points 
from discussions, there is no way to give online 
bio and chem students the educational equipment 

of a real lab. It’s the real life experiences — like 
mixing potassium with dihydrogen monoxide and 
finding out why safety goggles are a good idea — 
that can’t be duplicated online. There’s programs 
that simulate reactions, but watching a screen mix 
two different colors together at the click of a but-
ton is not the same experience as physically mix-
ing them yourself. 

Another department difficult to replicate 
online is foreign language. The best way to 
become fluent in a foreign language is by con-
stantly having live conversations. But this could 
pose a problem when there’s no human-to-human 
interaction.

One of the primary draws to online courses is 
that you can take them from nearly anywhere that 
has an Internet connection. But aside from miss-
ing out on real life conversations, there’s no guar-
antee that every student that opts for an online 
education will have the technology to support it. 

Some UCSD classes require specific pro-
grams that don’t work with both Macs and PCs. 
Consequently, students have to come to a campus 
and do their work in a computer lab — which 
won’t be so easy if they’re taking the class for 
purposes of convenience. Especially, if someone is 
taking the class as a parent with a full time job — 
making it to campus between work and the kid’s 
dance practice won’t be an easy feat.

In addition, most online classes have the capac-
ity to enroll thousands of students at a time — 
which, when taking room capacity and fire regula-
tions into consideration, will be an unlikely pos-
sibility if the program plans to have the students 
attend an in-class final. 

Online education is a solution for those that 
can’t physically make it to school, or can’t afford 
the extraneous student fees of room and board. 
But there’s no comparison between sitting in a lec-
ture hall and clicking through online slides. 

It seems that the proposed online degree pro-
gram is little more than a quick fix to the UC’s 
budget crisis. By filtering more students through 
an online degree program, the campuses will be 
able to generate more money, without putting in 
the time. But unless the UCOP takes steps to make 
sure online students don’t slip through the cracks, 
the UC degree is going to be worth as much as 
one from DeVry.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor, 
 The Arizona Immigration Law 

SB1070 has been a controversial issue.
However, I believe this law will 

create disorder. The law has been a 
major problem to Arizona residents. 
The law’s purpose, to eliminate illegal 
immigrants from Arizona, has a tre-
mendous effect on illegal families in 
the U.S. Many families have been sepa-
rated and children have lost their par-
ents because their parents have been 
deported. Many of these children do 
not have family that are legal citizens, 
rather than themselves. Just imagine 
how their lives have changed, the 
struggles and challenges that they con-
tinue to face. Children will either move 
to Mexico and continue their educa-
tion there where they have to pay, 
whereas here in the U.S. education is 
free. Politicians do not seem to realize 
the harm this law will create; instead, 
they just care about removing illegal 
immigrants regardless of the outcome. 
What have illegal immigrants done to 
politicians so they can react this way? 
The majority of illegal immigrants 
come to the U.S for a better life envi-
ronment, job opportunities and educa-
tion. The fact is, many companies will 
soon lose their business, and who will 
they have to hire? If immigrants are 
afraid to go to the hospital out of fear 
of local officials enforcing the immi-
gration law, disease outbreaks can 
occur. In my view, we need a system of 
immigration that allows us to  control 
our borders and create a clear path to 
citizenship. Something must be done. 
If not, we will continue to see move-
ment for local control which can have 
potentially disastrous consequences for 
our public health and safety.

Dear Editor,
 I have noticed some very envi-

ronmentally friendly efforts. However, 
many of these efforts are not as effi-
cient as they could be. Many students 
may not even know about them.

One effort I applaud is the trash, 
recycling and compost service provid-
ed at the dining halls. This separation 
of waste reduces landfills and pro-
motes a healthier earth. However there 
is a lack of clarity and efficiency in this 
service. Many students, like myself, are 
left to guess at which bin a tea bag, a 
chopstick or a napkin go into. Many 
students, left to their own judgement, 
place things in the wrong bin. Though 
the list of acceptable items for each 
bin is online, most students do not 
think about or do not have the time to 
search online for the list.

The Housing and Dining services 
should place a list of recyclable and 
compostable items near each of their 
respective bins. This would aid in the 
efficiency of the recycling and com-
post programs then, there would be 
no need to sort out unwanted trash. 
Recyclable and compostable material 
could be utilized if there was more 
information available. More people 
would be prone to recycle and com-
post if they knew what they could.

We Need Immigration 
Reform for Borders 

No Amount of  Cover Girl Will Make You a Good Politician

DRAWING FIRE By Johan De La Torre

A famous incident that proved 
that voters were 
more inclined 
to side with the 
better-looking can-
didate was during 
the first televised 
presidential debates 
between Kennedy 
and Nixon in 1960. 
People who lis-
tened to the radio 
thought that gaunt 
Nixon won the 
debate; people who 
watched on television thought suave 
Kennedy did. The difference was in 

the details: Nixon sweated profusely, 
refused to wear makeup, his suit was 

too light and baggy 
and he looked 
generally uncom-
fortable.  Kennedy, 
on the other hand, 
wore makeup and a 
fitted suit. 

The bottom 
line, whether we 
admit it or not, is 
that the way our 
politicians look 
does affect how 
we vote. But it 

shouldn’t. Instead of focusing on 
how shiny their hair is in the latest 

campaign ad, we should be focus-
ing on their policies and platforms. 
Politicians’ policies will be the same 
whether they’re wearing sweats and 
a muscle-tee or a tailored suit. It’s 
counterproductive to rank appear-
ance over policy.

With that said, I understand that 
looking one’s best is a part of the 
political job description. But though 
I’ve accepted that my national lead-
ers wear more coverup than my 
yearly paycheck can afford, I can’t 
help but hope that Fiorina will 
someday trade in her makeup artist 
for a new campaign manager (have 
you seen her demon sheep com-
mercial?).

tangled up 
with a pop star 

and a spy

W
hen looking for a voice actor 
for their new film “Tangled,” 
directors Byron Howard and 
Nathan Greno picked out 
bubbly girl-next-door Mandy 
Moore — an appropriate 

choice, if you happen to live next to a 70-foot-tall tower.
The pop star lends her vocal chops to Rapunzel in 

the 3-D adaptation of the old Brothers Grimm fairy 
tale. Her love interest — and home invader, and the 
recipient of many a frying pan to the head — is the 
charming thief Flynn Rider, voiced by Zachary Levi. 
Together, along with sidekicks Pascal and Maximus, 
they journey across the kingdom in search of mysteri-
ous floating lights.

The rush of suddenly being a part of the 50th 
member of Disney’s pantheon of animated features 
is a heady one for these two long-time fans. Though 
Moore worked with Disney in 2006 when she pro-
vided the voice for Nita in the direct-to-video “Brother 
Bear 2”, becoming a full-blown (thought unofficial) 
Disney princess — complete with long-haired dolls and 
Halloween costumes — is something completely new. 
For co-vocal star Levi, both voice acting and feature 
films are a vast departure from his goofy spy thriller 
“Chuck,” now entering its fourth season.

A member of The Guardian, along with reporters 
from the Cal State San Marcos Pride, the Daily Aztec, 

and The Falconer, sat down with Moore and Levi to dis-
cuss their fairy tale rise to stardom.
SM: So I’m sure both of you are both big Disney fans — 
Zach, I know that you are.
ZL: ‘Disnerd.’ [laughs]
SM: What’s it mean to be a part of Disney’s legacy now?
ZL: It’s mind melding. Growing up watching all of the 
films — not just the ones that are considered our gen-
eration’s, starting with “The Little Mermaid” on — but 

when I grew up, the Disney Channel 
was just starting to be what it was... 
There was no “Hannah Montana” or 
anything like that. I’m sure at Disney 
they were sitting around thinking, 
“What do we put on? Let’s just play 

all the old stuff.” I would sit there after school, watch 
all the old cartoons like “Pecos Bill” and “Johnny 
Appleseed” — I don’t know if you guys have seen any 
of these — and “Ferdinand the Bull” and “Lambert the 
Sheepish Lion,” and all these other random ones. And 
what’s amazing is that even those, even though they 
were kind of featurettes, a lot of those were considered 
to be part of the 50 [movies]. We’re the 50th animated 
feature, which is unbelievable.
MM: It was so cool to see all the ones before. We went 
to a screening a couple weeks ago... and they literally

INTERVIEW

L ike most girls, when I was 10 years old I wanted to be a star. After dragging my parents to *NSYNC 
and Christina Aguilera concerts, and 
wearing out my copies of Spice World 
and the “Footloose” soundtrack (don’t 
ask), I decided it was my turn to own 
the spotlight. 

This dream went beyond the typical 
singing into the hairbrush for an audi-
ence of my favorite Barbies shtick. I 
trained to become a triple-threat. 

It went well, kind of.
Sick of watching me attempt to 

tap dance around the house, my 
mom enrolled me in dance classes. I 
was pretty good, and thus began my 
descent into the world of competitive 
dance, where makeup on youngins isn’t 
JonBenet creepy, but a necessary com-
ponent to a first-place performance. 

The musical side of stardom, how-
ever, was a disaster. My East Bay Area 
elementary school was too poor to let 
us all play in the band, so those of us 
with musical aspirations were forced to 
take a test to determine our aptitude. 
At the tender age of nine, my dreams 
of rockin’ the drums or the clarinet 
were dashed — apparently, I wasn’t 
good enough. I was then begrudgingly 
thrown in the choir, where I mastered 
the art of pretending to sing (“water-
melon, watermelon”). Faced with my 
incompetence, I gave up on music for 
life (that is, until I tried to start a punk 
band in the eighth grade, but that’s a 
story for another day). 

Through all of this, the Aaron 
Carters and Lil Bow Wows of the world 
rubbed it in my face. Their fresh faces 
and platinum-selling CDs mocked me, 
saying, “We are talentless cash cows, 
and you, pathetic child, are not even 
good enough to play the clarinet.” That 
resentment prevented me from falling 
victim to the charm of baby pop stars.  
I rejected the Jackson Five for Thriller 
and Off the Wall; I rolled (okay, con-

showed, from the first film, 
all that came before up until 
“Tangled.” And it’s like, ‘Oh 
my God, “101 Dalmations!”’ 
Of course, I totally forgot. 
“Dumbo”!’ That is so above 
and beyond that we’re a part of 
it with this movie because you 
know, those movies, and “Little 
Mermaid” and so on, were 
such huge parts of our child-
hood. They’re so ingrained in 
my memory, like singing every 
single word of “Beauty and the 
Beast.” And now, this movie 
could potentially mean to kids 
nowadays what those movies 
meant to us. It doesn’t get much 
cooler than that.

you want to be Ariel?

SM: I’d say you’re more like 
Aladdin.

boys, that was more the movie 
because he was a guy.  There 
was also so much adventure 
going on. And the Genie was 
so good — Robin Williams as 
the Genie was maybe one of the 
most perfect Disney roles ever. 
And Abu is great, and the car-

pet is great, and Iago is great... 
definitely it was more male 
driven. And Jasmine was hot.
G: In animation, oftentimes 
once a voice actor is cast, they’ll 
go back and change the char-
acterization a bit because that 
missing piece of the puzzle has 
been filled in. Did that happen 
when you guys were cast as 
Rapunzel and Flynn?
ZL: Not the look, I don’t think 
so. They had pretty much set 
the look of the characters before 
we were cast. But they have a 
camera in there the whole time 
recording your voiceover, so — 
we’ve talked about this before, 
I think [Mandy] noticed a few 
moments of yours where you 
did something.
MM: Yeah, I was like, “That’s 
me!” Yes, gestures that she 
does, I was like, “Oh my Gosh, 
that’s so me.” Even my husband 
[noticed]. It’s pretty crazy. I 
think we thought the same 
thing in the vocal booth, that 
[the camera] would be for 
behind-the-scenes DVD stuff.
ZL: Yeah, that’s what I thought 
it was.
MM: And it really was for 
the animators to get to sort of 
see how we move. [To Levi] I 
mean, are you super animated? 
‘Cause I’m very gesture-y. She 
had to use the frying pan and 
I was [mimes swinging a fry-
ing pan with effort], like I was 
really holding the frying pan.
G: You guys were separate 
when you were recording?

ZL: We didn’t record dialogue 
together once.
MM: We only met when we did 
the duet.
ZL: We sang the duet together, 
but we didn’t get to do any of 
the dialogue together. 
MM: Doing all the press, all of 
this, is the first time we —
ZL: The first time we’ve hung 
together.
G: Is that difficult, when you’re 
imagining someone’s reactions?
MM: Yeah. I mean, I guess you 
get used to it as well. It allows 
you or forces you to dig deep 
into your imagination and give 
every different variation on a 
line you can give. And at least 
the directors were there — they 
were with Zach and they were 
with Donna [Murphy] for her 
sessions, so they know what 
they need to get from me to 
match what they love and 
they’ve already gotten from 
Zach. You have to just in there 
and throw caution to the wind 
and have fun.
F: You’ve portrayed so many 
characters in this really wide 
variety of films, from heroes 
like Rapunzel to more villains 
like Lana in “The Princess 
Diaries.” In your opinion, is any 
one type of character more fun 
to play or easier to play than 
others?
MM: It’s always fun to play the 
villain. [to Levi] Right?
ZL: Yeah, it’s fun to play the vil-
lain. I think societally, people 
are called upon to be nice peo-

ple — as they should be. I think 
it’s good to have standards, for 
people to treat other people 
with kindness and respect... 
[but] you don’t really have that 
outlet for those other parts that 
might be inside of you that’re 
just dying to yell at somebody. 
I don’t know if it’s a matter 
of exorcizing your demons, 
but when you get to be a bad 
guy, you get to. And there’s 
no recourse — you’re actually 
being paid to do that.
MM: It’s very cathartic.
MM: It’s always more fun to 
play someone that’s so different 
than yourself.
G: Zach, you’ve been branch-
ing out with your music career 
lately. Was the opportunity to 
sing a big draw?
ZL: Definitely, huge added 
bonus for this to be a musical. 
I’ve grown up my whole life 
singing. I love singing and I 
guess you always kind of hope 
that someone hears you and 
goes “Oh, you can actually do 
that. I’ll hire you to do that.” 
And they did, so it’s amazing. 
And the duet with Katharine 
[McPhee] and this are the 
only two things I’ve done. I’ve 
sang at some charity things, 
but nothing that’s ever been 
recorded, nothing that ever 
been a professional gig... I’d love 
to [pursue a music career], but 
only if somebody comes to me 
and says “I’d like for you to do 
this.”

JUMP THE RAILS

I n true “what you see is what you get” fashion, director Tony Scott’s latest doesn’t make any attempts at redefin-
ing (or even adding to) an expansive 
blue-collar action genre — instead, 
Scott defaults to action boilerplate. In 
any other context (or any other film 
with far less Denzel Washington) the 
outcome would have been catastrophic, 
but despite the moribund premise and 
occasionally overemotional moments of 
cheese, Scott’s flick delivers on its prom-
ise. It’s a mildly entertaining middle-of-
the-road action movie divested of any 
substantial thinking.

By nature, the film’s “Speed” premise 

narrows the film’s artistic and narrative 
scope down to a variety of well-timed 
collisions and a two-track story out-
come: Either the train stops or it doesn’t. 
Much like train 777, “Unstoppable” 
careens down its set path, restricted by 
its own main line. The movie follows 
a straight-faced, no-nonsense train 
engineer, Frank (Washington), who has 
been assigned to teach new pretty-boy 
conductor Will (Chris Pine) the rules 
of the train yard.  After two bumbling 
fellow employees lose control of a half-
a-mile-long train, Will and Frank set 
down the tracks to retrieve the freight 
(which, to raise the stakes, has poison-

ous substances on board) and assuage 
the woes of a nervous populace and the 
ever-grumbling vice president Galvin 
(Kevin Dunn).   

Though “Unstoppable” panders to 
the working class by making an ass of 
anyone with a six-figure salary — a 
well-timed move, considering the state 
of the economy — none of the char-
acter’s hustle can keep the film from 
seeming lazy. Information on the lead-
ing men is minimal — as they talk shop, 
we’re told Will’s wife hasn’t spoken to 
him in two weeks, and Frank’s wife died

FILMREVIEW

Moore and Levi Finally Kickin’ It Outside of  Animation
▶ TANGLED, fromÊpageÊ7Rihanna

Loud
DEF JAM

R ihanna is addicting.  She’s a consequence-free, one-night stand with rum body shots in Barbados. She’s the morning you spend waking up and wondering 
why your underwear is on a telephone line outside. 
She’s fun, but her unabashed pop hooks make her the 
guiltiest kind of pleasure.  

On fifth studio album Loud, Rihanna teams up again 
with production team Stargate (Tor Erik Hermansen 
and Mikkel Storleer Eriksen) who helped produce pre-
vious hits “Don’t Stop the Music” and “Rude Boy.”  To 
keep the party going, Stargate pulls together buzzing 
synths and hip-hop tempos on tracks like “Only Girl In 
the World” that aim to keep you on the dance floor.

Loud boasts several big-name appearances. Drake 
turns up on “What’s My Name?” where he comically 
raps, “The square root of sixty-nine is eight something” 
(guess Drake never made it through algebra). Rihanna 
even samples Avril Lavigne on “Cheers (Drink to 
That),” to humorously awkward — yet somehow catchy 
— effect. 

But most of the guest artists fall flat next to Rihanna, 
who has never seemed more at home. Her voice sounds 
confident and clear, commanding you to hang on to 
each word. Nicki Minaj is the only one who can keep 
up on unrestrained album highlight “Raining Men” — a 
girl-power anthem filled to the brim with beats, horns 
and schoolgirl chants.

The album doesn’t hold back. Rihanna is anything 
but coy when she drops sexual details in euro-style 
“S&M” with lyrics like “Sticks and stones may break my 
bones/But chains and whips excite me.”  

 Loud is the singer’s return to the picture-perfect 
pop form that her work embodied before her brush 
with domestic violence and the subsequently melo-
dramatic Rated R. There are no dark experiments here 
— only Rihanna’s Barbadian voice leading you through 
pounding synths. Despite the collaborations that litter 
the track list, Rihanna’s vocals mark the album as dis-
tinctly her own.

That is, until the album’s closer. On the sequel track 
“Love the Way You Lie (Part 2),” Rihanna ends Loud 
with a beautifully soft and vocally driven version of 
the mega-hit from Eminem’s Recovery.  An emotion-
ally bare Rihanna nails every note, but the mood is 
destroyed as soon as Eminem enters and infuses it with 
his over-the-top rage and spousal abuse.  

It’s regrettable that Rihanna couldn’t edit this second 
cut to exclude the addiction-riddled Slim Shady. Maybe 
we’ll get a “Part 3” that finally gets the song right.

ALBUMREVIEW



from cancer a couple of years back. Faux-concern shared 
between the actors is thrown into high relief by half-baked 
character development.  Frank’s single-parent stock persona 
isn’t aided by writer Mark Bomback’s apathetic attempts at 
quirk — Frank’s daughters, god save him, work at Hooters. 

Outside this undynamic duo, sidelined characters are 
caught in the entrails of their own kitsch. At one point, a 
train full of school-aged children stare, slack-jawed, as the 
unmanned train passes by, ooh-ing their delight. Later, 
Will’s estranged, disenchanted wife bursts into alligator 

tears as her husband’s fate becomes increasingly unclear.
Nonetheless, “Unstoppable” chugs along, punctuating 

dialogue with an impressive display of explosive grandeur 
— cars, trains and people all go up in a dazzling, twisting 
array of billowing flames and cloud-smoke. But the movie 
is overly concerned with its own machinery — prolonged 
shots of sparks as brakes hit metal, trains flip over in fan-
tastic 180-mid air twists and a scowling, brow-furrowed 
Washington come at the cost of a more intricate plotline. 

But derailing a money-maker comes at too high a price, 
Galvin says. And “Unstoppable”’s head-conductor Scott 
agrees.

HIATUSÊ FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 2010Ê THE UCSD GUARDIANÊ9

tinue to roll) my eyes at Justin Bieber; I wanted to shred 
Hannah Montana’s wig. I became a music critic.

But with the snap of a neck, some fabulous hair and a 
catchy-as-hell chorus, Willow Smith changed my mind. 

Willow’s “Whip My Hair” video is the fiercest thing 
I have ever seen from anyone who isn’t Beyonce. Like a 
miniature combination of Sasha Fierce herself and Nicki 
Minaj, the spawn of Will and Jada managed to throw 
down the catchiest song of the year, and I can’t stop listen-
ing.

I’ve thrown out my back trying to imitate her. I’ve 
caught myself envying her style. And don’t mock me — 
you know you love it too. Willow’s video has over 14 mil-
lion views on YouTube, and she’s even killed it on “Ellen” 
— in tune. Take that, Rihanna.

But the phenomenon goes beyond one little girl with 
plenty of swagger. Willow is at the forefront of pop music’s 
newest trend: the fetus wave. 

Look at YouTube sensation Lil P-Nut. He’s a seven-
year-old with more flow than Drake could dream of, bust-
ing out lines like “I’m Lil P-Nut/I’m looking for my jelly” 
with goofy self-confidence. It’s too freakin’ adorable for 
words.

The trend isn’t exactly new. “Kids Say the Darndest 
Things” style, people have always been obsessed with 
precocious kids. We like to watch children act like mini-
adults. It’s endearing. Or creepy.

Thing is, this time around I have finally caught on. 
Perhaps it was my envy of their famous childhoods (or 
their lack of skills) that kept me out of this “fetus wave” (I 
really need to stop calling it that), but now there are a few 
talented kids out there convincing me otherwise. 

I especially have Willow to thank, because with her — 
like with Michael Jackson — childhood stardom doesn’t 
necessarily feel like a gimmick. With talent like that, it 
feels inevitable. Willow is actually. . . good. And my man 
Lil P-Nut is totally a star in the making. Let’s just hope 
they don’t succumb to crack and porn like the rest of ‘em. 
Meanwhile, I’ll be in the corner wishing I had famous par-
ents. And a clarinet.

O ver the past few years, neo-soul has become a tired genre. With 
the exception of ambitious 
efforts from artists like 
Erykah Badu, the genre’s 
more pop-friendly con-
tenders (Alicia Keys, Amy 
Winehouse) lack creativity; 
meanwhile, its traditional 
mainstays (Raphael Saadiq, 
Maxwell) seem content 
to endlessly rehash retro 
song structures and instru-
mentation. It’s due in part 
to this stagnant musical 
climate that Cee Lo Green’s 
new album, The Lady 
Killer, is so refreshing — or 
at least part of it.  

First off, Cee Lo 
deserves props for sneak-
ing a song called “Fuck 
You!” into the Billboard 
Top 40. Novelty aside, 
“Fuck You!” is a tremen-
dous song. It’s an energetic 
combination of Motown 
and modern hip-hop that’s 
clever and, most impor-
tantly, a lot of fun. This, 
ultimately, is The Lady 
Killer’s greatest strength: 
While the album is very 
much indebted to the 
sound of traditional ’60s 
soul, it reinterprets the 
genre in a way that’s mod-
ern as well as respectful. 

After a cheesy but 
charming introduction, the 
album opens with “Bright 
Lights, Bigger City.” The 
delightful dance number 
pairs Cee Lo’s relaxed 
vocals with bright syn-
thesizer and a bass line 
reminiscent of Michael 
Jackson’s “Billie Jean.” 

Other highlights include 
the endearing ballad “Old 
Fashioned” — which lay-
ers the singer’s adaptable 
tenor on top of old-school 
doo-wop — and the 
almost-too-smooth soul 
jam “I Want You.” These 
songs, along with most of 
the album, represent some 
of the catchiest, most glee-
ful music Cee Lo has ever 
released — including his 
smash hit “Crazy” with 
Gnarls Barkley and his two 
previous solo albums.   

The album’s downfall is 
its inconsistency. During 
the album’s midsection, 
tracks like “Bodies” and 
“Satisfied” seem lazy, as 
though Cee Lo — rec-
ognizing the automatic 
charm of his vocal chords 
— decided to take it easy 
and reproduce the same 
tired throwback style. Most 
of these tracks have similar 
lovelorn lyrical content 
and ’60s musicality. While 
perfectly enjoyable, they 
lack the tongue-in-cheek 
genius that made “Fuck 
You!” and “Bright Lights, 
Bigger City” stand out 
against other neo-soul 
jams. 

If the singer had kept 
his momentum through-
out the album, it could 
have been exceptional. But 
even if Cee Lo is guilty of 
including filler, The Lady 
Killer still exudes plenty 
of magic — expletives 
included.

Y ou’d think toking would make a brother happy as shit, but Kid Cudi’s soph-
omore venture Man on The 
Moon II: Legend of Mr. Rager 
has more of the singer’s same 
“Pursuit of Happiness” lyrical 
downers. And aptly so — it’s 
where he shines. But ulti-
mately, the rapper’s moments 
of boundary-pushing genius 
are lost in a predominantly 
disjointed effort. 

Most of Cudi’s tracks focus 
on production value and 
psychedelia, but the album’s 
drumbeats, heavy synth, vari-
ety of instruments (including 
strings), Pink Floyd samples 
and guitar-heavy choruses 
make it even less danceable 
than Cudi’s first effort. For 
swagger-stacked rappers like 
Kanye and Jay Z, this would be 
a non-issue. But Cudi’s vocals 
can’t keep up — he stutters 
and stumbles in a dazed and 
lazy drawl, lost amongst his 
far more engaging backdrops.  
The confused track “Erase 
Me” typifies his misdirection; 
the chorus unexpectedly shifts 

to heavy ‘90s school-house 
rock — an avenue left unex-
plored in the rest of the album. 
The rager is winding down, 
and Cudi can’t keep his head 
straight.

Not that all of Cudi’s 
smoky slow-jams take a beat-
ing on Legend of Mr. Rager. 
On intro track “Scott Mescudi 
Vs. The World” (yeah, the self-
pity isn’t lost on us either), a 
punchy and robotic Cudi raps 
over a tinkling, otherworldly 
track as crooner Cee Lo offers 
a buttery contrast to the rap-
per’s monotonous tone. 

Man on The Moon II 
makes serious attempts at 
autobiographical honesty, but 
the lyrics’ poignancy (Cudi 
raps “I’m numb faced while 
thinking about suicide” on 
haunting “Please Don’t Play 
This Song”) is wasted on an 
overworked attempt to strad-
dle genre lines. Instead, Cudi 
teeters on, but never quite 
crosses over into the edge of 
true discovery.

SPORTSÊ FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 2010Ê THE UCSD GUARDIAN 11 

By Hanna Rahimi
Staff Writer

The No. 9 UCSD Men’s Water 
Polo team earned an important vic-
tory on senior day this past Sunday, 
pulling off an 13-8 win over No. 19 
Pomona-Pitzer.

The game was neck-and-neck 
for the first three quarters, but the 
Tritons pulled ahead in the final peri-
od to the five-point lead that marked 
the final score. 

“I think we started a little bit 
slow… It took us three quarters [to 
get into the game] and it shouldn’t 
have,” senior two-meter defense 
Jakub Bednarek said. “We know how 
we can play and we weren’t into it 
mind-wise in the beginning… but at 
the end we proved we can play.”

Within the first two minutes of 
play, the Pomona-Pitzer Sagehens 
found the net to put the first points 
on the scoreboard. UCSD failed to 
answer in its next possession as a goal 
attempt floated on the line but didn’t 
go in. Pomona-Pitzer scored another 
goal in the two-meter zone after an 
offensive turnover, bringing the score 
to 2-0.

The Tritons responded with two 
goals of their own, but a backhanded 
skipped shot found the net and the 
Sagehens led 3-2 at the end of the 
first period.

Senior driver Bryce Madsen tied 
the score to start the second quar-
ter, and sophomore utility Brian 
Donohoe scored with 5:16 left in the 
period to give the Tritons their first 
lead. The squads continued to battle 
and went into the half with the score 
tied at 6-6.

“I think when we blocked them 
at half time, we realized this is our 
last game,” Madsen said. “We had 
to come out strong, and everybody 
picked it up for the seniors. We were 
motivated to swim hard and obvi-

ously we all did that.” 
Donohoe scored two of his five 

goals of the match to start the sec-
ond half for the Tritons, but the 
Sagehens kept fighting and were able 
to stay just one behind until, with a 
good show of ball movement from 
the Tritons, Madsen scored with 34 
seconds left, bringing them ahead 
for good.

“It was a bit ugly at first, but it 
was good,” junior goalkeeper David 
Morton said. “That was a really 
important game for us, so it was just 
good that it was on senior day too 
and that we got the win.” 

Morton recorded 11 saves for the 
match.

The Tritons made their seniors 
proud in the fourth period when 
senior driver Ryan Allred shot a quick 
two-meter donut, bringing the team 
three goals ahead of the Sagehens. 
The Tritons scored four goals in the 
quarter to put the game out of reach.

“It’s been a great four years,” 
Madsen said. “I couldn’t ask for a 
better way to finish it; I’m just excited 
that we get to finish it in this fashion 
and come out with the win.” 

Next up for the Tritons are the 
WWPA championships Nov. 19-21 at 
Santa Clara University. This Saturday, 
Nov. 13, the team will play two scrim-
mages against the club teams Sunset 
San Diego at 12 p.m. and the San 
Francisco Athletic Club at 2 p.m.

“We have a week off next week 
where we’re just going to train and 
prepare,” Morton said. “We don’t have 
any official games next week, and 
then we have another full week after 
that. So we have two full weeks to 
prepare and work out going into con-
ference championships. I feel pretty 
good, especially after Friday night’s 
game, considering how we played.”

the Year Award.  

The Tritons are in good form 
defensively, shutting out nine teams 
and allowing just five goals in the 
past 14 matches. UCSD also ended 
the regular season with five con-
secutive shutouts. But San Francisco 
State has proved tough defensive-
ly as well. The Gators are ranked 
second in the league for the least 
amount of goals allowed and are 
tied with the Tritons for the most 
shutouts. Gator goalkeeper Annicia 
Jones has also tallied a league-high 
97 saves, and earned Second Team 
All-CCAA honors. 

With five players on the roster 
measuring 5’10” or taller, Wethe 
concedes that San Francisco may 
have a physical advantage, but that 
the Tritons are by no means the 
underdogs going into Thursday’s 
match.

“San Francisco State’s greatest 
strength is their size and strength, 
but I’m confident that we have the 
talent and work ethic to beat them,” 
Wethe said. “I think every person on 
the team is motivated for the game 
Thursday, and if we stay focused 
defensively and keep our composure 
in the final third, we shouldn’t have 
any problems.”  

The match will be played this 
Thursday, Nov. 11, at BYU-Hawaii 
in Laie, Hawaii, at 10 p.m. The win-
ner will advance to play against No. 
2 seed BYU-Hawaii this Saturday, 
Nov. 14, at 10 p.m.

Should UCSD emerge victorious against San Francisco, hosts BYU-Hawaii await the Tritons. The Seasiders have just one loss this sea-
son — against island rival Hawaii Pacific — and have played West Region No. 1 Seattle Pacific to a draw. Aside from the loss, BYU-Hawaii 
was dominant this season, scoring 45 goals in 17 games while allowing just eight. However, the Tritons face a much tougher confer-
ence schedule, as the CCAA is more competitive than the Pacific West Conference, in which the Seasiders play. While UCSD faces a 
significantly longer trip, BYU-Hawaii will have to travel from its North Shore campus to the Waipio Soccer Complex on the outskirts of 
Honolulu, meaning neither side will have the advantage of being familiar with the pitch. The squads are not familiar with each other 
and the match could be nervy at first, but the competition the Tritons have seen this season gives them the edge in this matchup.

SECOND ROUND

The Tritons’ first opponent will be a familiar foe in conference rival San Francisco State. The Gators made the NCAA tournament for 
the first time in school history by winning the CCAA Championship last weekend, earning the conference’s automatic berth. Thursday’s 
matchup will the third meeting of the season between the two teams, with each of the last two matches playing out to scoreless draws. 
The second match was in the CCAA tournament on Nov. 5, when the Gators were able to advance after penalty kicks. Thursday’s 
match will feature the conference’s top two goalies, UCSD’s Kristin Armstrong and SFSU’s Annicia Jones, who made the All-CCAA First 
and Second Team, respectively. Goals will be scarce, but the Tritons have an edge in goals per game with 1.95 against the Gator’s 1.35. 
One goal in regulation will most likely prove to be a winner, although penalty kicks might once again be decisive.

FIRST ROUND

NCAA DIVISION II TOURNAMENT

HOPPING
By Rachel Uda • Staff Writer

The women’s soccer team is headed to Hawaii, where they will play their first match in the NCAA Division-II tournament this week against No. 6 seed San Francisco State University. An NCAA selec-
tion committee announced on Monday that the Tritons, who ended their 
regular season with a 14-2-2 record, had clinched a place in the national 
tournament, falling to the No. 3 seed in the West region behind No. 1 
seed Seattle Pacific University and No. 2 seed Brigham Young University-
Hawaii. They will be joined by CCAA rivals No. 4 seed Cal State Los 
Angeles, No. 5 seed Montana State, and first-round opponents San 
Francisco State.

San Francisco State received the automatic bid into the NCAA tourna-
ment after capturing the CCAA championship. With a 10-4-2 conference 
record, the Gators snubbed Cal State Dominguez Hills to get the last spot 
in the CCAA playoffs, where they beat the Tritons in the semifinal round 
and upset top-ranked Cal State Los Angeles to capture the conference title.  

Thursday’s game will mark the third meeting between the Tritons and 
the Gators this season. On Sept. 26, the teams played to a scoreless draw in 
a match that went to double overtime. Similarly, in their semifinal defeat, 
the Tritons sent the game into overtime, where they were defeated by the 
Gators 4-3 in a penalty shootout.  

When asked if UCSD will make any tactical adjustments in prepara-
tion for the match, junior captain Annie Wethe said the Tritons are feeling 
confident and will look to stay the course.

“It will just be a matter of coming in ready to play, and wanting it more 
than [San Francisco],” Wethe said. “I actually thought we played fairly well 
against [San Francisco] on Friday and I don’t think we deserved to be sent 
home early from the CCAAs. I’m actually glad that we have a chance to 
redeem ourselves. The difference will be putting away our chances and 
staying 100-percent organized on defense.” 

Wethe joined junior goalkeeper Kristin Armstrong and senior mid-
fielder Lisa Bradley in garnering First Team All-CCAA honors. Junior 
forward Sarah McTigue and junior winger Shelby Wong made the All-
CCAA Second Team, while sophomore defender Hayley Johnson received
