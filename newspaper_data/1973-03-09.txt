ueSD to Suffar $2.5 Million Loss Due to Government Cuts 
K.thy Reddin, and Gres Moser 

The effect of President Nixon's spending cutbacks 
and impounding of funds on UCSD will be the loss of 
an estimated two and a half million dollars, according 
to Chancellor Mcelroy. This is a tentative figure which 
may be revised downwards if congress takes positive 
action. 

Although there will be a widespread tightening of 
belts in many departments and some staff reductions, 
administrators say that overall the status quo will be 
maintained. They say losses will be softened by the 
ability of staff to compete for other sources of funds . 
Possibly, there will be some state assistance. 

The real financial "dlsasters" will occur in the 
medical school and in most training. grants for graduate 
students and fellowships. Hard facts are still few and far 
between as departments do not wish to frighten 
employees unncessarily because in many cases the fate 
of funding is still unknown. 

Dr. Clifford Grobstein, Vice-Chancellor of Health 
Sciences, says he is anticipating the loss of an estimated 
one and a half million dollars in federal support. 

The med school has already been informed that the 
Regional Medical Program, which supplied some $700,-
000 has been terminated as of June 30. It is not known 
whether funds for phasing out existing programs is 
supported will be obtained. 

Some of the funds it provided supported continuing 
education for practicing physicians, a group working 
on kidney transplants, and a coordinating council that 
brought local hospitals, colleges and doctors together 
to map out training efforts for the community among 
other programs. 

The med school will receive S365.000 this year in 
General Research Support, one-third of that next year, 
and one-tenth the following year. These were funds 
used to start new laboratories, thus aiding younger

New Applications: 
Muir Over Quota, 
Revelle, Third Under 

Hannah Cohen 
This year for the first time Muir College has received 

more freshmen applications than Revelle College. As a 
resu lt of this imbalance, 100 new freshmen, who don't 
expect to graduate from UCSD, will be asked to 
administratively transfer to Revelle voluntarily for the 
duration of their freshman year. The two colleges hope 
that in this way they will be better able to utilize their 
resources to handle next year's freshmen load. 

The Revelle application drop is part of a nationwide 
trend in application drops. However, this drop is not 
considered serious because Revelle will still have a full 
size freshman class. It means, rather, that Revelle will 
not have to redirect applications as they did in the past. 

As of February 17, according to Registrar Ron 
Bowker, Revelle had received 971 freshmen 
applications and Muir had received 1,269 applications. 
Revelle's freshman applications' quota for 'this year had 
been 1,089 and this is the first year Revelle has fallen 
short of its' quota. Muir's quota was 9043 and this is the 
firs t time it has been exceeded. 

Thir College, as Revelle, according to Bowker, has 
fa llen short of its' quota receiving thus far only J.4 
fres hmen applications when its' quota is 104. 

The total quota of freshmen applications for UCSD is 
2,2~6 excluding students from the Educational Oppor-
tU nity Program and as of February 17, 2,274 applications 
had been received. Out of this amount it is expected 
that 1,300 or 61 per cent of the applicants will register. 
Another 250 EOP students will register giving next 
year's freshmen class a size of 1,550 students. 

There are many reasons why applications to Revelle 
have dropped. Only last year both Muir and Revelle 
had received an even amount of freshmen applications 
and the year before last Revelle had a large excess of 
applications similar to the excess Muir now has. 

Hazel Alksnis, Academic Assistant to the Revelle 
Pro.vost, thinks the application drop Is due in part to the 
natIonwide trend towards vocatlQnal career education. 
Two other facts Ms. Alksnls pointed to were the fact 
that many Ph.D.'s are currently out of work and the 
pressure of the draft is now off. 

Bowker thinks that the drop In applications to

faculty in getting grants . They also supported 
educational programs such as the bio-medical lecture 
series. 

Community Medicine's outreach program, funded 
by the Office of Economic 'Opportunity, will probably 
lose substantial funding. These three clinics were 
supported by some S1,800,000 in San Ysidro, Southeast 
San Diego and North County. As much as S500,000 may 
be cut from this budget. 

Training grants that supported some 60 fellows at the 
med school will be terminated, though they will 
continue through this year. However, strenuous efforts 
are being made to find other sources of support for 
these people. 

These are already M.D.'s, but they are learning some 
specialty. The loss of such qualified people will not be 
felt in society for 5 to 10 years. But, loca lly, patient care 
will be undermined by the loss of these physicians at 
University Hospital. 

In keeping with the administration policy there were 
no new funds for the bUilding of any new medical 
facilities thi' vear. 

A progr called Capitation, which is based on a 
House b ' ntended to help medical schools increase 
their class sizes, will continue to run for two years, but 
it seems unlikely that it would be renewed. This 
supplies the med school with some $400,000. 

The financial prognosis is not all that grim. Cancer 
and heart research are being well-funded. O ther 
departments hard hit will be Anthropology and 
Biology. The Chemistry and AMES departments will 
also be affected substantially. 

" Nixon ought to die a slow, agonizing death," 
anthropology department chairman Dr. Marc Swartz 
said. "This is not just a small nu isa nce, it's a real 
disaster." 

University of California, San Diego 

The new UCSD Health Center planned for 1974. 

Health Center to 
Open in 1974 

Hannah Cohen 
UCSD's new student health center's building will be 

completed sometime between May 1974 and Sept. 
1974. It has been in the planning stage for two years 
now. The basic shape, which has been established by 
the campus planning committee, will be large enough 
to serve a college community of 7,000 students and is 
specifically designed so that it can be expanded to cater 
to a student community as large as 15,000. 

The building of the health center is being financed 
by a S914,000 building loan from the Regents which 
UCSD i~ paying back through registration fees . 
However, as yet the health center planners do not have 
the S200,OOO needed to equip the building. 

The architects of the building are Tucker, Sadler, and 
Bennet of San Diego. Currently, Or. V. Robert All n, 
the director of the health center, is going over the 
blueprints with the architects to decide where such 
things as light switches and doors will be placed . The 
detailed drawings must be approved by the campus 
planning committee. Once thse items have been com-
pleted the building contract will be put up for bids for 
San Diego contrilctors. 

The new student health center Is "designed to meet

Ar.thropology, whose federal funding amounted to 
$130,000 this year, is anticipating the loss of up to half of 
this amount. The National Institute of Mental Health, 
from which most of its money came, is being ter-
minated . Its other major source, the National Science 
FOl!ndation, will have no additional fu nds to dispense, 
so competition for these monies si expected to be stiff. 

One major grant, which supported the training of 
eight graduate students per year, has been terminated. 

Training grants are also being stopped in the Biology 
department. last year some 30 graduate students were 
supported this way, this year there will be only five . But 
again, other sources of support are being desperately 
looked in to. 

Also some $250,000 of project development funds, a 
kind of umbrella grant from the National Institute of 
Health, is being terminated. 

In the chemistry and psychology departments, and in 
the AMES medical program, it is the training grants and 
support for graduate students that is being almost 
immediately terminated or drastically reduced . 

For the Chemistry Department, this means the virtual 
end of a ten-year program to train physical 
biochemists. This program supported some 30-35 
graduate students last year. 

Existing fellowships will be honored, but there will 
be no new Career Development Awards. This program 
provided additional faculty members not only in 
chemistry, but biology, medicine and other 
departments as well. 

The full impact of the budget cutbacks on all 
departments will not be known for several months as 
agencies are re-shuffled and grants are returned. It will 
be years before the effects are felt by the community at 
large.

Africa's Dual 
Heritage 

Tim O ' Neil 
Professor Alfred E. Opubor spoke at the third lecture 

of the Community and Society lecture Series last 
Tuesday. Professor Opubor, who is the Director of the 
African Studies Center at Mi...higan State University, 
spoke on the subject of " Black Africa : Communication, 
Identity, and Multicodality." The Communications and 
Society lecture Series, sponsored by Third College 
Communications Department, is free and open to the 
public. 

He opened with the statement that "there is a certain 
ambivalence in most African States," Professor Opubor 
then continued to say that contemporary Africa has a 
dual legacy. A legacy which is European and Colonial 
on one hand, and indigenous on the other. 

"This dual legacy is reflected in the lives and move-
ment of Africans, although most Africans do not wish 
to recognize it," says Professor Opubor. 
" In the last two decades, some African writers have 

been recognizing this duality in their world as 
"manifestations of what happens to an African Culture 
that comes in contact with the West." 
"In political terms, the African states have been called 

upon to look at themselves initially from a preder-
mined framework ." 
" This predetermined framework, idealized by the 
colonia lists, consist of the ideas that the nation is a U.N. 
member, has the typical foreign money and trade 
problems, a repre entative government i in power,

Women's Classes 
SE~ - Another 
Student Service 

Muir and Revelle students upon early registration 
may take classes offered by University Extension free. 
There are 136 fee-waived spots for each college (exten-
sion classes numbered 100-199 carry university credit 
and usually cost $45). 

Karen Armitage 
Most students are aware of the services provided to 

them by the University such as medical care, 
counseling, library services, etc. The Student Employ-
ment Office, also known as SEO, provides another 
student service. It is located in 210 Me. 

SEO has several functions; one of the most important 
being aiding students in obtaining employment. 
Although SEO is not a placement office, referrals can 
be obtained for part-time jobs on campus or for jobs 
listed from local areas . All job openings are posted on 
large bulletin boards. The University requires an infor-
mation card application from each prospective 
~mployee. Fillin~ out forms is a hassle, but the informa-
tion cards are useful. Many employers (especially on-
campus) prefer \0 review the information ca rds before 
interviewing a;J plicants. The cards also give SEO an idea 
of the talents and interests of UCSD students. 

At a time \~h n jobs for students are scarce, SEO 
ca nnot guarart any student a job, but a variety of job 
possibilities are list d. The salary range varies with the 
degree of skill required. 

SEO is als;) the personnel office for students 
employed wit h staff titles on campus. Under the 
direction of Judy Manternach, UC policies and 
procedures that affect employed students are inter-
preted and enforced. All UC Student Personnel files 
are maintained in this office. Students can also receive 
cou nseling regarding employment benefits, 
limitations, or personal work-related probl ms. SEO 
often serves as arbitrator if a student has a complaint 
about his or her working conditions or if a department 
is not satisfied with their student employe (s). SEO also 
manages the employment portion of the Work -Study 
programs and the Student Corps. 

If you n ed a job or if you work on campus you 
should keep In touch with the staff of the Student

Two classes in the Daytime Women's Program of UC 
Extension have been approved for credit for UCSD 
students: Literature X1 14 "Eight Women Who Followed 
the Muse: A History of the American Woman as Poet" 
by Linda Brown, M.A.; and '100 "Images of Women in 
Contemporary Though" taught by Marilyn Pearsall, 
Ph.D. Ms. Brown's course, more fully described on 
page 63 of Explore, the Extension catalog, is not an 
ordinary class in poetry. It focuses on women poets to 
answer such questions as " Are women poets neurotic 
spinsters prone to suicide and madness? Is there a 
difference between what male and female poets have 
to say about love? How can one tell if a poem is 'great'? 
Has the Women's Movement had an impact on the 
poets of the seventies?" The class begins with Emily 
Dickinson, the first "modern", and includes cigar-
smoking Amy Lowell; favorite of the "flaming youth" 
of the roaring twenties, Edna St. Vincent Millay; and 
the tragic suicide and current cult heroine Sylvia Plath. 
The nine-meeting course will conclude with a live 
poetry reading and question-and-answer session by 
local women poets. There is a possibility of a guest 
appearance by a San Francisco poet in May. 

Literature X114 will meet Mondays from 1-3:45 p.m., 
beginning April 2 in the informal setting of University 
Lutheran Church at the corner of Torrey Pines Road & 
La lalla Shores Drive. If you are interested in either one 
of these classes, register Monday or Tuesday before the 
fr spaces are gone. 

Employment Office. 
The SEO staff is interes~d in knowing how well their 

office is meeting the neeBs of the students. They have 
written a questionnaire asking for responses and com-
ments from students. A copy of this questionnaire 
appears in loday's paper. Students are encouraged to 
fill it out directions for returning it appear on the 
bottom of the questionnaire.

Crisis I n Child Care ... 
Save Our Children's Centers 

The things we cannot stress strongly 
enough at this point is the fact that 
EVERYONE must do something, we must 
not sit back and shake our heads, or wait 
until the centers are closed to us before 
we get riled up. Just in case you may be 
wondering whether it will do any good 
for us to write, here are a couple of facts 
to consider: 

a) At the end of World War II, the 
government announced they were 
closing all day care centers. The 
parents rebelled and demanded 
that the centers be maintained ... 
they were . 

b) People have been talking with 
our State representative. Gloria 
Brownlee. and were told that 
becau se of the letters already 
written and the outcry from some 
officia ls , a thirty-day extension 
period has been granted . 

Now. if we can really turn the heat on, 
that thir ty-day extension may well turn 
into a permanent continuation of our 
centers . So, you see, we can do some 
good and we can turn th ings our way if 
we make an effort to let everyone con-
cerned know how we feel. Write to 
President Nixon, write to the Ad ~ 
ministrator of Social Services, write to 
every ~enator a nd Congressman yo u 
have e\ er heard of, write to Governor 
Reaga n . and stress that yo u want the 
centers kept open and yo u want them to 
have the same educational facilities that 
they now have , not just custodial 
benefits. Whilst you are busy writi ng, 
make sure that your boss writes too (he 
can state his position as an employer 
who appreciates having someo ne 
working for him that has no babysitting 
problems). If you belong to a Union, 

have them write. Call local news 
stations, newspapers, make a nuisance 
of you rself ... eventually they will do 
something if only to get you off their 
backl 
Child care can be saved by YOUI Here's 
how: 

1. Choose the person/people you will 
write to from the list below. 

2. Be sure to communicate the urgen-
cy of your request. 

3. Choose one statement from each 
co lumn as the test of the letter. If possi-
ble, add some specific example or ex-
perience you are familiar with . 

4. Ask your friends a nd neighbors to 
use this material as you are. 

5. Write IMMEDIATELY, and at least 
once a week on any 'important issue 
related to children and families.

Revelle Cafeteria Faces Problem 
MEMO: To all UCSD Students 
FROM: Revelle Resident Hall Board 
To Those it Should Concern, 

Though it is perhaps not apparent to a 
majority of people. the Revelle Cafeteria 
is faced with a problem which is about to 
have a serious repercussion is faced with 
a problem which is about to have a 
se rious repercussion o n the nature of 
food-service for a ll stude nts in the 
future . The problem at hand is that of 
the removal of food from the cafeteria . 

Now it is well known by everyone that 
food i , being removed from the 
cafeter ' a on a daily basis, and the 
rationalz that "one cookie isn 't going to 
hurt an'/one" and " well what's a couple 
of ice <.reams" seems sufficien t to clear 
anyone 's onscinr. e nrl allow them to 
remove things at will. However, most 
people s em to be unaware of the 
extent :0 which these sma ll items add 
up. For txa mple : an average piece of 
fruit, say ta ngeri ne, costs the cafeteria 
an ave a e of 4¢. Now if each person 
were to take just one tangerine out of 
the cafeteria ea h day. the excess ex-
p nse would come to $730.80. Yes it 
sou nds incredibl , but it's true . And it 
isn't merely fruit that is being ta ken out. 
Consider the xp nse wh nth r mova l 
encompass s donuts, blintzes, pastry, 
sandwiches, meat. che s , and even 
steaksl (It is e t imated that a hundred 
steaks are walked ou t with "during steak 
nights). 

What is the e ffect of this gross removal 
of food? Well. the food service in the 
cafeteria is run on a budget which is 
de6igned to offer you a large variety of 
decent food based on an approximate of 
what you will be able to eat while in the 
cafeteria . By taking additional food out 
of the cafeteria, the expense of this extra 
food is taxing the budget to the point 
where only by lowering the quantity or 
quality of the food can the budget be 
maintained . In other words, unless 
something is done to prevent the rip-off 
of cafeteria food (as well as candles, 
silverware, a clock, etc.). food service, as 
we know it, will have to undergo a 
c hange whic h cannot possibly be for the 
better. 

We of the Residence Hall Board in an 
a tte mpt to avoid this from happening, 
have studied the problem, and realize 
that there are only a few possible 
foremats which can prevent this 
problem. One, would be a massive food 
ration program, with a series of ration 
ca rds and other clumsy paraphenalia 
designed to limit the AMOUNT OF 
FOOD PEOPLE COULD HAVE TO EAT. 
Anoth r would be to have an employee 
of some sort. specifically design d to 
gua rd th exit and be responsible to stop 
people with briefcases, bookbags, and 
coats, and c h ck that food is not being 
taken out of the cafeteria, and upon

LITTIRS 
Saltman 
Caught 
Again? 
Editor: 

We were surprised to 
read in last Tuesday's issue 
that Paul Saltman was com-
pletely satisfied with the 
results of Affirmative Ac-
tion. We feel that he has 
done nothing to warrant 
that satisfaction. and that 
he is plain "bull-shitting" 
to save his own face . We 
are a coalition of ' UCSD 
students which have been 
around here for well over 
two years, and we are 
beginning to see the real 
truth about Paul. To begin 
with, we have not con-
vinced ourselves ihat we 
are the people of "-
quality", the "cream of the 
crop" so to speak, that Mr. 
Saltman has been quoted 
in the past as calling UCSD 
students. We do not 
believe that we are 
"better" people than the 
rest of the human race just 

because we attend UCSD. 
We do not believe that Mr. 
Saltman has enough 
authority or knowledge to 
make such a value judg-
ment . We believe that 
these statements are 
further rhetorical phrases 
that administrators like Mr. 
Saltman are prone to 
regurgitate to students, so 
that we students remain a 
passive block of ego-
inflated pseudo-
intellectuals. 

reporters did further 
research into matters, 
presenting facts to the 
readers in lieu of 
propagandistic statements. 
We wish to point out that 
statistics by themselves do 
not present a total picture, 
but should be accom-
panied by further written 
explanations. In this one 
area, referring to Affir-
mative Action, we would 
like to see how well UCSD 
has lived up to its promises, 
how the goals and timeta-
bles have been met, and to 
what degree; and if you 
must include statements, 
we would like to see more 
coming from less biased 
sources. We were glad to 
see that there were quotes 
from people other than ad-
ministrators in your last ar-
ticle, but we would like to 
see more explanations 
along with those 
statements so that we 
could more adequately 
judge which side is the 
more correct. Thank-you 

Paul Saltman has not 
been noted for his truth-
fulness in the past. We do 
not really expect truth to 
flow out of the mouths of 
administrators . After all, 
administrators' jobs are 
dedicated to protecting the 
interests of the institution, 
and covering up the in-
stitution's faults. There-
fore, we do not readily buy 
up statements printed in 
your newspaper that are 
quoted from ad-
ministrators like Mr. Salt-
man . We wish, therefore, 
that instead of quoting 
such sources, your

Origins 
Scott Smith, Tom Cantor, and Michael Roe 

In the past exchange of letters it 
appears that the basic argument against 
presenting the theory of creation in the 
classroom is that creation is contrary to 
science. Dr. Daniel Hartline indicated 
that science involves observation and 
verification - with the development of 
hypotheses based on all the relevant 
facts (Triton Ti~s, January 23, 1973). 
According to these standards, evolution 
has no greater claim to science than 
does creation in explaining the origin 
and development of life; neither is 
observable or verifiable by repetition. In 
analyzing the two theories, any discus-

~ion concerning their validity should be 
based on phYSical/scientific evidence. 
This criteria must be used , particularly 
with the realization that the 
evidenceused to support evolution in no 
way contradicts the tenets of creation. 
(With this in mind we can close the 
discussion to philosophical dogmas that 
make no attempt to ·deal with the 
evidence as it exists .) 

11 is a fact that random, nonliving 
chemicals have become highly complex 
livi ng matter during the passage of time. 
It is not the factual development of 
matter itself which is now being dis-
cussed. but rather the theories which 
have been proposed to account for this 
development of order. Few today will . 

·give serious consideration to a theory 
that invokes an extra-natural being. 
They thus limit the field of scientific 
explanations to a single theory which 
mayor may not be true. 

Perhaps one of the greatest problems 
with evolutionary theory is that it is not 
examined critically at the university 
level. Alternatives are not considered, 
weaknesses are not probed, even if the 
alternative might better explain the

evidence and even if the weaknesses are 
more than trivial. James D. Watson has 
stated: " ... the theory of evolution itself 
is a theory universally accepted not 
because it can be proved by logically 
coherent evidence to be true, bu t 
because the only alternative. special 
creation, is clearly incredible" (Nature, 
124) . Th,is is only a value judgment and 
similar arguments are no basis for the 
exclusion of a theory that does, in the 
end, provide a reasonable explanation 
for the evidence. A prime example of 
what we are speaking of is the fact that 
naturalistic mechanisms and 
phenomena do not provide a conclusive 
explanation for the origin of life . Even 
man with his knowledge and ability to 
control and manipulate the variables has 
not been able to repeal what he 
proposes to have happened randomly, 
i.e . the development of self-replicating 
life forms. An argument for evolution 
must consider this situation and cannot 
be based upon the hope that one day 
man will create life. Creation provides a 
re'asonable explanation for why ·this 
should be, as well as accounting for the 
other scientific evidence that we are 
aware of at this time. 

In conclusion, we propose that the 
two theories be presented by qualified 
representative scientists in a classroom 
setting. Specifically, Dr. Russell Doolittle 
has proposed that he and Dr. Duane 
Gish participate in a series of lectures 
conSidering the evidence and how each 
theory deals with il. We ask that this 
proposal be carried out . Our point is not 
to suggest that evolution as a theory be 
thrown out, or that only creation be 
taught, but that each should be critically 
and continually re-examined so that 
students truly can make a choice based 
on the evidence.

TIll 
Craft Center 
Not the Only 
Creative Outlet 
On Campus 

Dear T.T. Editor, 
I have one question: In 

what vacuum have you 
been keeping the reporter 
who wrote the Craft 
Center in Financial Crisis 
article? The center may be 
in financial trouble, but it is 
NOT "the only non-
academic creative outlet 
for students on campus." 
The ignorance shown in 
this description disgusts 
and incenses me. 

Assuming the mistake to 
be an honest one, let me 
present the activities of the 
UCSD Theatre as an exam-
ple of the fallacy involved 
in Craft Center description. 
The Drama Department 
has produced two shows, is 
now in the middle of a 
third production, and plans 
a fourth production for the 
spring quarter. All of the 
Drama Dept. productions 
are under the direction of 
the Drama faculty and All 
productions are cast by 
open auditions. I personal-
ly have produced one 
Chi ldren's Theatre show 
and will produce a second 
spring quarter. Casting was 
and will be done by open 
auditi ons. 

The Drama Club, which 
anyone who is interested 
can join, has just finished a 
li mited run of its original 
play set in the Com media 
dell' Arte style . The Drama 
Club plans to present five 
one-acts in repertory near 
the e nd of the Spring 
quarter. In addition to per-
for mance, all of the 
productions have offered 
opportunities to work on 
tec hnical aspects of 
theater. 

The point is that anyone 
concerned enough to give 
of themse lves to creative 
and exciti ng theater can 
certainly find the oppor-
tun ity . One must realize 
that the Theatre activities 
are only a few of the many 
creative non-academic 
out lets open to students on 
campus. 

If you, Dear Editor, need 
more examples, take your 

troop of eager-to-get-at-
the-REAL-facts reporters to 
the information center and 
poke around in their lists of 
campus organizations. By 
making careful notes of 
~hat is going on, you may 
In the future avoid errors 
such as the one in the Craft 
Center article .

Nixon Has 
Done It Again 
Dear 'riends, 

For those who thought 
that day care as an issue 
had died in the face of 
increasing public accep-
tance - a few surprises: 

1. All public day care 
centers have been or will 
be closed due to the 
elimination of funds by ex-
ecutive order . Bet you 
thought it was only 
Veterans and EGO! 

2. And if you think 
you're safe in private 
centers. the word has gone 
out on you, tool Federal 
subsidies are being cut 
backl 

3. Working mothers will 
be ineligible for public 
centers regardless of in-
come. Welfare mothers 
have a remaining six 
months of grace. 

4. There will be no funds 
for pre-school education 
programs in those public 
centers which remain tem-
porarily open. In addition. 
there will be drastic cut-
backs in funding for cer-
tified faculty. The result 
will be a glorified babysit-
ting service. 

Nixon's past inaugural 
theme has been one of 
self-help and the old boot 
strap motif. It appears that 
his conC!ept of the 
American Dream is 
restricted to a select few. 
That few does not include 
Vets who have served their 
country, families in need of 
public housing, the elderly, 
hungry children and 
students. 

Increasingly, financial 
aids are diminishing, as are 
funds for construction of 
schools and expansion of 
programs. Not surprisingly, 

the ITIajority of people 
affected by these cutbacks 
are poor minorities and 
women. 

One is tempted to ask at 
this point how we are sup-
posed to help ourselves? 

Presented with the ideal 
of extended education, we 
are denied it! Instructed to 
find work and be self-
supporting, we are 
hampered by a sexist 
educational system and in-
adequate child carel 
Forced into roles we do not 
desire, we are being 
manipulated like puppets? 
Denied our rightfully 
chosen place in society. 

But the end is not yet in 
sightl We can - and will-
resist these barriers to our 
goals. 

A core group has been 
developed at UCSD under 
the initiation of Beverly 
Varga, Assistant College 
Dean, single women, and 
s t.u den t mot her s, 
organizing a task force to 
halt these government cut-
backs. We NEED Your 
,oI,ss;stancel 

A massive letter writing 
campaign will help. Time is 
limited I We have less than 
one month to act. Public 
day care centers in San 
Diego will be closing as of · 
mid March, 1973. 

Letters should be ad-
dressed to all elected 
government officials from 
President Nixon on down 
to your local assemblyman.

Comments On 
"Another 
Answer to 
Christian 
Evangelism" 
Editor: 

First of all , I would like to 
say that I read and tho-
roughly enjoyed Tom Can-

tor's article, "ANOTH ER 
JEWISH ANSWER TO 
CHRISTIAN EVANGE -
LISM." Never before have I 
seen such a well punc-
tuated article. Cantor's use 
of periods, commas, quo-
tation marks, parentheses, 
and capitalization of 
Proper Names is truly out-
standing. 

I've decided to write to 
you because, after reading 
Tom's article, I was in-
spired, and decided that it 
was time to tell my story. 
Besides, I just finished my 
last midterm. and I have 
nothing else to do. 

When I was young, I 
used to be a Catholic. Every 
Sunday morning my 
mother and father would 
schlep me to Church . 
However. something 
seemed to be missing from 
my life. Something spiritu-
al was lacking; something 
which the Church failed to 
provide me with . The truth 
was I wasn't meeting any 
girls. It was for that reason I 
vonverted to Judaism (also 
because the Jews had more 
holidays I could take off). 

The Jewish people had 
always been known for a 
history of persecuti'ln, like 
when they were kicked out 
of their homeland Egypt 
because they couldn't 
come up with the rent. I 
felt I could somehow per-
sonally associate with their 
suffering. I, myself, had 
always seemed to be 
ridiculed and persecuted 
by my peers. Well . for ex-
ample, one day in high 
school, the quarterback of 
the school football team 
bloodied my nose in the 
locker room, after I had 
simply told him that he 
dressed like a girl. 

Also, Judaism provided 
many heroes for me to 
emulate, like Moses. Eins-
tein, Sandy Koufax , 
Trotsky, and, of cou rse, 
John Wayne (oh , didn't 
you know?) . Also. there are 
a lot of Jewish girls for me 
to fantasize about at night. 
like Lainie Kazan a nd 
Carole King. 

Anyway, I was fina lIy 
hooked on converting to 
Judaism after having gone 
to my first Friday night ser-
vice at my local synagogue. 
The religious ceremony 
was really beautiful. First of 
all, Rabb i Kasha chanted 
beautifully from the Torah 
(he had a voice like AI 
Martino·s) . After finishing 
his chant. he broke into a 
medley of Burt Bacharach 

hits, and then finished off 
the evening service with an 
hilarious impression of his 
aunt Bessie (which he did 
in drag). The whole thing 
was an experience I'll 
always remember. 

As always 
Sincerely yours,

Homosexual 
Oppression 
Editor: 

In my second letter (jan 
19), I launched into a rather 
lengthy tirade as to why a 
homosexual becomes a ho-
mosexual. I was, at the 
time, very enthusiastic 
about dispelling myths and 
informing others on the 
subject of homosexuality. 
It ha s recently been 
brought to my attention 
that this was a mistake on 
my part and I must agree. 

At first I was impressed 
by Dr. Bieber's work as I 
thought it was great that he 
had done some in-depth 
research on homosexuali-
ty. and what was more im-
portant, he was drawing 
conclusions and answering 
questions. But after a little 
guidance and a little 
thought I have come to the 
conclusion that Dr. Bieber 
and his work represent 
another, more subtle, form 
of homosexual oppression. 

Obviously the homosex-
ual deviates from the norm 
set by our straight , 
masculine society. We are 
" queer" and therefore 
people are naturally suspi-
cious (and a little afraid) of 
us. They need an explana-
tion to account for this 
difference - to categorize 
us. This is what Bieber has 
done. he has provided a 
nice neat explanation, i.e. 
we are mentall y sick, suf-
fering from a phobia (a 
phobia that Dr. Bieber and 
other psychoanalys ts cash 
in on - they can "cure" 
you if you go for 350 hours 
of treatment). I was sucked 
into his rather sterile. sci-
entific explanation - an 
explanation which I now 
realize is not important . 

Difference (from the 
norm) does not have to be 
explained by " mental 
sickness" - difference can 
occur naturally and ca n ex-
ist side by side with the 
norm and is no less valid -

Controversy Resolved 
Manifesturd: 

An Aesthetic Opinion 
TO THE TRITON TIMES; 

As three ex-grad students in the UCSD literature department, we feel more 
qualified than any of the previous disputants in the great art controversy to say 
what art is and what art aren't. Art is EFFORTS, ORGANIZING, FIGHTING .... 
ONES ... PROGRAM ... EVENING ... RACISM ... WOMAN'S .... RAllY .;. 
UNION .... PROTECTION .. , P.M ..... ESPECIALLY. INTERNATIONAl. It s 
aspiration rapacity and tedium. 

Is this reality or isn't it? Fart twice and tear up the page. The answer will be 
clear to you. (WE'lL TAKE SIDES *** We're on Martha's side *** ONE OF 
US SAYS SHE'S BETIER, BUT WHICH ONE ... These are our sexes ... 
AARDVARK, CANNIBUS, YEllOW. . . , 

Do we think it's important to define art? Sure. We're so bored we thmk It s 
important to do anything. A."d boring tool . 

With all the oppression gomg down t~ay. mlgh~ ~s well take as many drugs 
as possible. but we believe in art. we believe In politiCS at least some of us. Our 
political parties are : CAMel, SCAllYWAG, HOMOSEXUAL 
MARXIST*lENNINIST (the camel's bisexual).. . 

A problem that mayor may not be an art problem IS the follOWing: CHOOSE 
ONE ; HOW MANY TIMES A DAY DO WE FUCK? HOW MANY TIMES A DAY . 
DO WE NOT FUCK? DO WE KNOW THE DIFFERENCE? HOW DO WE SPEND 
OUR NON-FUCKING TIME? WE WORRY ABOUT WHAT ART IS OF COURSE. 

INSTRUCTIONS FOR DECIDING WHETHER 
SOMETHING IS ART OR NOT 

1. Soak overnight in quart of vinegar 

2. If you can pee after you 've sensed it, it's not artl 

3. Will it rescue you? Are you drowing in a sea of tears?

Awaiting On You All 
Tom Undberl 

The scene is the Obuhod Hospital in cell No. 17. The room is dark,.cold, and 
empty except for two bent and shivering figures huddled beneath a sl':lgle grey 
blanket. Although their faces cannot yet be seen one of the men IS clearly 
more haggard than the other. He crawls out from the tan~le under th~ blanket 
as a soft light begins to brighten the cell. He stretches painfully to qUicken ~he 
flow of blood through his body, and then relaxes again on ~he floor, bUSYing 
himself with a deck of cards. He is Germann; the other IS known only as 
Madman. 
Germann; Trey, seven, ace! Trey, seven, queen! Trey, seven, ace I Trey, 
seven, queen! 
Madman : You lose. Ha! 
Germann : NOI You are wrong. I win, see? I win. Trey, seven, ace! Ace!. . 
Madman : You can never know exactly what will happen to you next In life, 
you see. We are all victims of terrible fates, products o,f a wrathf~1 GO? . 
G: But .. . but, the ace, for heaven's sake, the ace! Can t you see It. Isn t It 
bright and handsome. And so distinct. • 
M : And singular too. But nonetheless we have no control ov.er Its 
appearance or lack of appearance. It is all a fTlatter of. fate, pure and Simple. 
You will have to agree with me on t~at pomt. Fate IS our master. 
G; Indeed, it is all in the cards. look, I shall tell your futu.re. Put your ha~ds 
there, that's it. Good. Now close your eyes and think of s?meth~ng

anyone, even to yourself. And a two of hearts. love will soon come to you. 
Even though you are a nothing someone will come to you with open arms 
and an open heart . What was once two terribly lost souls will become one 
happy couple. 

M : Yes. But is that good? , 
G; But of course. How can two not be better than one. Isn t a two-horse 
carriage must faster than only one. 
M ; Isn't the ace better than the two? 
G: Don't contradict me. It is I who is predicting your future. Wha! I say must

and only our insults can convince them of that.

M : Fooisl You are destiny, and your destiny is my destiny. 
G: My destiny .... Calculation, moderation, and industry. Not only have I 
been known to risk the essential in hope of gaining the superfluous. 
Independence, that is my dream; and secretive ambition is my means. let 
them laugh, I watched with a love unequalled by any of the participants. To 
be shrewd and cunning, that is my method. I fell in love. That was my key. 
Passion is the essential ingredient. No one was passionate enough to realize 
that only I could control my detiny. She was a sweet girl, innocent and 
provocative. As pure as gold, she held the key to the treasure and I couldn't 
be stopped. Can you imagine my jubilation when my winning card came up. 
I was clever, I was passionate. Not greedy, mind you, not like all those other 
fools who thought they could bring it all home without effort. Such greed! 
But the secret was mine and it can't be denied. Trey, seven, ace. Trey, seven, 
ace. I win . I have always won. I will always win. Calculation, moderation,

M: You can never know exactly what will happen to you next in life, you see. 
We are all at the mercy of fate . Don't deny it. Yours was a good destiny, as 
was mine. Nothing can change that. We are happy. An island of sanity amidst 
so many fools. The masses are so ignorant. Who will control their destinies? 
G; Society has designed ways of dealing with the masses, those incapable of 
handling themselves. I was almost sent to one myself, before I saw the truth 
in my cards. 
M ; Yes, and thank goodness no one thought of slapping me into one of 
those places, those lunatic asylums. Before everything was so foggy, so 
chaotic. When do I go to work? Where are my shoes? Who took my pen 
knife. Don't talk to the Director's daughter, and of course dogs can't talk. 
Who needs me? Why am I so insignificant? Don't treat me like that. But now I 
can see dearly, now the fog is gone. The human brain is not a part of man 
located in his thick skull; it comes in on a wind from the Caspian Sea. 
G: Interesting. Thoughts are intriguing, but all a game. Nothing more than a 
natural phenomenon that comes like a wind and is just as soon gone. Have 
you ever tried to live what you thoughll I mean, did you ever think that you 
weren't what you were but instead something entirely different, and then 
find that what you originally thought was no more valid than your newest 

. idea? What is so important, after all, about a cold wind from the seal What is 
so important about a rank in the Engineers? 
M : And what is so important about her, or even them? Why can a dog write 
nearly as well as me, and why does a year make me brighter or taller? Do I see 
that blanket or is it an illusion? An illusion is something unreal which seems 
to be the opposite. Am I the opposite of an illusion or just a hand of the 
Division. I am, rather, the King of Spain and my country needs me. I must 
prove that Spain is no different than China. Shoelaces are too tight in Ru ssia 
and it all lies in the hands of Virgin Mary. After all, is it not true that she was a 
virgin and a mother? 
T; Most remarkable. But where is your throne? Don't you feel naked without 
it? 
M ; I have learned that I won 't feel naked if I only refuse to. They are refUSing 
to acknowledge my position, and at first so much interest was taken in me. 
Now I am needed but unwanted. What can be done? 
G: You must remember that I hold the cards; I am in control. You will have to 
learn your lesson better. True, you can never know exactly what will happen 
next, but you can make it seem to be almost anything. 
M: But they are chaSing me, pouring cold water on my head. I have no more 
strength. What can be done? Someone pushed me into a hole, and it is dark 
here. Don't you see? Don't you smell the earth? 
G: Yes, the hole is cold. I was pushed, too. I was in love and couldn't be left 
alone. Nothing is as it seerps, and now this is a dreadful hole. Why can't it be 
a pasture? Who put us here? 
M ; Let's pretend we are in that pasture; let's rest to catch our breath. The sun 
is hot. Can't you feel ill 
G: Yes ... yes, it is warm, and the ground is soft. But I am frightened. Someone 
will come. 
M : Remember, it is an illusion. Nothing but a chilly wind. 
G: Awind? 
M ; An esoteric breeze meant only to be enjoyed. Hold on to that. 
G; Such fools! Can't they see that, too. It is clear, why not a straight line? 
M: A sacrilege! 
G; Right! We can do it. Nothing hits harder than nonsense. We must 
communicate to the fools with their own words, a language they don't 
even understand. But they must. 
M ; Quiet! Someone is coming! . 

An upright, white figure enters carrying a long, limber stick. Germann and 
Madman instinctively step back. The newcomer speaks. 
N: You fools. Get upl Are you going to act properly today or will we have to 
continue to teach you those lessons? 
G (aside); Insult himl 
M : You fooll You idiotl Go back to your farm. 
G (aside) : No, no. Disgrace him. Shame him. 
M : You are a disgrace. We don't like you . leave us alone. You make us ill. 
N; What are you muttering? You crazy nuts are real cases. 
G; The truth; you think we are insane, but it is an illusion. You try to form us 
with strikes of pain, but we don't feel them. You stink of rotten clothes and 
sweat, but we don't smell you. You are grotesque, but we don't see you . You 
starve us, but we are not hungry. We have no heat, but we aren't cold. We 
are insane because we don't come close to your designs, and we are insane 
because we have come too close to you. Don't bother with us; we are 
hopeless. Write us off, forget us. We are your disgrace, your ugliness; and 
you can't even see us. Lookl Here we are. He is the King of Spain . Give him

He exits. 
M: You were wonderful. 
G: He was wonderful. I am sick. 
M: But you told him the truth and it disgraced him. He can't see that you 
hold the cards. He doesn't know what we know. He doesn't realize that 
nothing is as it seems. That is wh he left, isn't it? 
G: He left out of disgust of us. He heard the truth but is still ignorant. He does 
not know that we hold his fate; we do. We know that. 
M : We know what is important. 
G; We know what is deadly. He walked away in ignorant man. We remain to 
try and rework our destiny. They are well out there and so content. The tr y,

Getting Married Haydn and Schubert Endure . 
Here comes the bride ... there goes the groom. The 

wedding is a near miss by mutual consent - cancelled 
after the bride is informed of the rights she loses by 
marriage and the groom reads of the new respon-
sibilities he assumes in Edwardian England. 

Music of the Austrian composers, Franz Haydn and Franz Schubert, is currently 
being performed in a ten day festival arranged by the La Jolla Civic/University 
Orchestra and Chorus Association through chairmen Edwin London and Louise 
Spizizen. 

"The Schubertians", an all male choral group from the University of California, 
Santa Barbara, will perform in St. James Hall, La Jolla, on Saturday, March 10th. The 
chorus toured Eruope during Easter week in 1971 singing in Schubert's birthplace, 
Vienna, among other cities. 

Intriguing ideas on marriage and divorce are offered 
by various family characters assembled for the celebra-
tion. Unexpected action by the young couple in love 
solves the impasse. Who but George Bernard Shaw 
could write of such fun and frenzy of matrimony ... 
possibly anyone, but this might still be worth a second 
look, 65 years after its original production in 1908. 

Robert Haffenden will be featured in the Mini-Concert, Athenaeum, La Jolla, on 
Monday, March 12, playing Haydn's "Piano Sonatas." 

"Getting Married" is being presented at the Carter 
Center Stage, located adjacent to the Old Globe 
Theater in Balboa Park, now through April 1. Producing 
Director Craig Noel is staging the comedy which stars 
Christine Hulter, David Fennessy and John Ellsworth . 
Students through college are admitted for $2 to all 
performances except Saturday evening. 

The Music Center, Matthews Campus, UCSD, Room 409, will be the location for 
four programs during the festival. Bertram Turetsky will direct a group of graduate 
students in a chamber concert on Thursday afternoons at • p.m.; an open chorus 
rehearsal will be held at 8 p.m., Wednesday, March 14th, of Haydn's "Mass in Time of 
War"; and Tuesday noon, Donald Erb, American composer, will lecture on "The 
American Composer and the Symphony Orchestra." The public is invited. 

The La Jolla Civic/University Orchestra and Chorus will conclude the festival on . 
March 18th with two concerts in Sherwood Hall, at 3 and 8 p.m'. Programmed is 
"Euryanthe Overture" by Carl Maria von Weber; "Mass in Time of War" by Haydn; 
and "Symphony 19 in C Major" by Schubert. Tickets may be purchased for these two 
concerts at the box .office prior to t~e performante. 

Castles in the Sand 
An international organization recently established in San Diego will be building a 

giant sand castle on Ocean Beach on the 18th of March in preparation for Earth Day 
on the lOth. The group calls itself World Life Day and focuses most of its energy on 
promoting the September Equinox as World Life Day. 

Recently the group has joined with a New York based group named Wrold 
Equality, Inc. and both groups are now working to call attention to the March and 
September equinoxes as world holidays - Earth Day in March and World Life Day in 
September. Everyone interested in protecting the environment and building the 
peace is invited to attend the sand castle celebration. Come to Ocean Beach, north 
of the pier, all day Sunday, March 18, prepared with shovels, lunches, balloons, Earth 
flags, pinwheels, and friends. 

Exhibitions 
Now at the La lolla Museum of Contemporary Art is 

an exhibition of photographic work by Allan Miller 
entitled "Parts and Accessories." 

Miller is an Associate Professor of Art at California 
State University , San Diego. 

He employes a wide range of graphic reproductive 
techniques, including combinations of photo etched 
zinc, photo-aluminum, photographic chrome plating 
and photo enameling in order to produce incisive 
imagery. 

This imagery - the "parts and accessories" of the 
exhibition's title - refer to parts of Miller's own body, 
including actual X-rays of his gastro-intestinal tract. 

By encasing the works in transparent vinyl packages; 
Miller intends a satiric statement about our growing 
"supermarket" culture where eVPrything, even our 
vital organs, may become marketable andl or ex-
changeable. 

A selection of the artist's exhibits includes 
"Typomunous 20/2", Stuttgart,.Germany; the Brooklyn 
Museum; Focus Gallery, San Francisco; and the 
Institute of COntemporary Arts, London, England . 

His exhibition will continue in the La Jolla Museum's 
second floor galleries through March 18. 

On Wednesday, March 14, Miller will lecture in 
Sherwood Hall on "Photomedia" - new techniques in 
use - under the auspices of the Museum. 

Opening tomorrow and running through May 6 on 
the first floor of the La Jolla museum is "Kurt Schwitters 
and Related Developments", an exhibition of and 
about collage centering on the work of the German 
artist who was born in Hanover in 1887 and died in exile 
in England in 1948. 

Presently showing at the Fine Arts Gallery of San 
Diego are graphics by Max Beckmann, lucite sculp-
tures by Bruce Beasley, and continuing series of con-
temporary work of the Fifth Moon Group of Chinese 
artists, featuring the paintings of Hung Hsien. 

Young Mothers Music 
Frank " llIfdll'Y" Zappa and the illustrious Mothers of Invention will at last appear 

in casual concert at the San Diego Sports Arena on Saturday, March 24. Also 
appearing will be special guests, the Doobie Brothers and Reuben and the Jets. 

Zappa has recently assembled a new band of Mothers, made up from earlier

Fencers F·inish Third 
In San Francisco 

So what can you do after 
you've won 15 straight dual 
fencing meets, and two 
large fencing cham-
pionships all in the space of 
about three months. Well, 
the logical thing to do is 
take on the biggest, 
meanest, and best 
organized opponent that 
you can possibly find . And 
that's exactly what the 
Triton fencing team did last 
weekend at the Western 
Intercollegiate Fencing 
Championships at San 
Francisco. They took on 
perennial powerhouse Air 
Force, who came to the 
meet fully equipped with a 
nine year domination of 
the Western's and an en-
tourage of trainers, 
managers, squires, lackeys, 
along with novels of very 
good fencers. 

As it turned out, the 
meet was much' closer than 
anyone expected. In fact, it 
was about as close as it 
could have been. As ex-
pected, Air Force won with 
46 points, followed by UC 
Berkeley with 45 points, 
and good ole' UCSD with 
44 points. The meet was so 
close that one touch meant 
the difference between 
first and third for the 
Tritons. Also, the northern 
California officiating bias 
meant a difficult time for 
our home-grown southern 
California squad. 

Individually, UCSD took 
one first, one fifth, and one 
ninth, to help score their 44 
points. Mike Jones took 
ninth in saber, while Stan 
Robinson finished fifth in 
the foil. To show you how 
close the whole meet was, 
if Robinson had managed 
one more touch on his 
opponent, he would have 
finished first. However, 
one Triton got all the 
breaks and ended up 
beating the National Junior 
Champion for first place in 
the epee event. This UCSD 
super-hero was none other 
than mild-mannered, soft-
spoken Howard Eno. Ole' 
Howard fenced his con-
ditioned little heart out to 
beat 63 other top notch 
fencers and prove himself a 
national contender. 

The only thing left for 
UCSD fencers now is the 
National Championships. 
Three athletes are eligible : 
Mike Jones, Howard Eno, 
and Dick Sax. However, 
only Eno and Sax will go 
because Jones has other 
plans - getting married . 

As for next year, what 
would you expect the 
notchers of 35 straight to 
do? Go on winning and 
winning, right? Wrong . 
Coach White has decided 
to try and revolutionize the 
fencing meet. Instead of 
merely competing next 
year, he intends to hold 

Swip.gin' Girls 
Glide to Win 

Cheryl Elliot 
In their first practice match of the year, the women's 

intercollegiate tennis team defeated Palomar here 
Wednesday 4-3. 

The team had been practicing all quarter under the 
coaching of Chris Mattson, but had yet to play any kind 
of match until their meeting with Palomar . 
Wednesday's match was a continuation one that had 
been started but got rained out. 

The Triton lineup was very experimental since it was 
only a practice match . Irene Allen played first singles, 
and won 6-4,6-1 . Adrienne Harber lost a hard-fought 
match, playing second singles. She won the first set 6-4, 
and lost a 9 point tie-breaker in the second set that 
went to the wire. She was slightly outplayed in the third 
set, losing 6-4. Anna Burnett lost 6-3, 6-2, playing third 
singles. Marsha, playing her first match ever, played 
well, losing the first set 6-3 and then went ahead 5-2 in 
the second set only for rain to set in, postponing the 
match to Wednesday. Marsha had to forfeit. 

In doubles UCSD swept all three matches. Cheryl 
Elliott and Margaret Eisele defeated Palomar's first 
team, 6-1, 6-1 . Debbie Zomparelli and Maria thiossi 
prevailed in a good, tough match 6-3, 6-3. In the 
number three doubles, Cathi Davis and Julie Sweeters 
won 6-1, 6-4. 

The regular season started Thursday for the girls at 
outhwestern. Look for announcements about the 

girls' home matches, and come out and watch a team 
that looks even better than the one which tied for first 
place in the league last year. 

group seminars, discussing 
fencing strategy, officiating 
and the French language. 
He also plans to use video 
tape to analyze fencing 
styles and techniques. And 
then, instead of fencing 
with his own team, he 
plans to take members 
from each school and 
make up integrated teams. 
This will render such things 
as 35 straight wins a totally 
obsolete concept. 

It just goes to show that 
when you have a great 
coach, great desire, great 
athletes, and great attitude, 
you can also come up with 
some great ideas. And 
along with these 
revolJ.ltionary new ideas 
will come some bright new 
shiny faces . A few of these 
up and coming stars are 
Myron Hill, Anne nickey, 
PAUL Uster, Jeff Tien, Max 
Whaley, Evelyn Pickelman, 
Phil Kulani, Jeff Brook, 
Glen Balanni, and super JC 
transfer Joe Thompson . 

So, with the season a 
success, and the future a 
rainbow, Coach White and 
his friends happily face the 
sunset. 

Locker 
Renewal 

Let it hereby be known 
that all gym lockers must 
be either cleared or 
renewed with the custo-
dian in the cage absolutely 
no later than Friday, March 
23. Should anyone fail to 
perform this little task, any 
clothing or equipment 
found in their locker will 
not be bagged as in the 
past, but will simply be 
discarded. 
New Applications ... 
Conlinued from page 1 

Revelle is due to the 
changes made last year in 
the Muir curriculum. He 
also feels that the current 
student trend is drifting 
away from the sciences. 

UCSD's admission 
problem is nowhere as 
crucia l as the admission 
problems thatthe UC 
Riverside and UC Santa 
Barbara campuses are now 
facing. UCSD's problem is 
getting people to apply in 
proportions to the amount 
of students each of UCSD's 
three colleges can accept. 

Both Ron Bowker and 
Haz.~1 Alksni feel that one 
way to alleviate the dis-
propoportion is the 
number of applications the 
colleges are r ceiving is to 
establish an active recruit-
ment program. One ha 
already been established to 
work with the junior 
colleges transfer students.

Ruggers COp

lohnno Staight 
The UCSD Ruggers are the Southern California, 

College Division Rugby Union Champions. They won 
this distinction last Saturday as the Tritons edged the 
Aztecs of San Diego Stat~, 16-15. The game was close all 
the way. 

The game started with UCSD driving State back to 
their own goal line. On a quick play, a State sprinter 
broke free and was on his way to a spectacular 80 yard 
try, when Dug Beanan came from nowhere to nail the 
Aztec just three yards from the goal. Beanan had 
chased the opposing rugger all the way, giving him a 15 
yard head start. After most of the other Tritons had 
given up on the runner. 

Beanan continued to playa particularly outstanding 
game, doing a great job in Bill Gates scored twice for 
the Tritons, with Peter Sertic converting once, while 
State scored twice. Mid-way into the second-half, the 
score stood 12-10 with State in the lead. Five minutes 
were left when UCSD was awarded a penality kick, 
which John Ringwood booted in to give the Tritons a 
13-12 lead. State battled desperately, and with two 
minutes left, they were awarded a kick , which gave 
them a slim lead 15-13. Our gang banged their way 
down the field once more and in the closing seconds, 
an impolite Aztec, in his enthusiasm, committed a 
heinous non-no. Sertic, lined up for his penalty kick 
and successfully converted the referee and the kick, 
giving UCSD the slim victory. The championship was :

BB Stars Stomp 
Southwestern 

Would you believe UCSD's female intercollegiate 
basketball team is as e)(citing to watch as the UCLA 
Bruins? Well , they may not be quite as exciting, but the 
Triton girls devastate and dominate their opponents in 
a manner analogous to the Bruins. 

Our girls continued their winning ways by crush ing 
Southwest!'!rn Wednesday night, 62-27. The game was 
never close, as the Triton starters, Hilary Chitt ick, 
Sharon Wood, Aliena Salmon, Judy lower, and Dianna 
Barba, proved too formidable for Southwestern. Th is is 
not to say that Southwestern played as the score might 
indicate, but the Tritons are just that tough. 

The Triton 's Bill Walton, in the form of Judy lower, 
proved again why she was last year's MVP as her 22 
points led all scores and her rebounding controlled the 
game. Other outstanding play was seen from Sharon 
Wooodl who at gua'rd, stole the ball numerous times, 
scoring 12 and turning back the girls from 
Southwestern who would not give up. 

Fine support from the bench came from Sioux 
Amaral , Elaine Fong, Allison Chen, Kathy Spatafore, 
and Ms. Maurx. 

What was most enjoyable about the game was the 
attitude of the players and their coach, Ron Carter. It 
was evident that the playel s enjoyed playing. There was 
nq pressure on anyone and everyone played; no 
matter what the players ability, they play. Th is seems to 
be Ron Carter's policy. It will be interesting to see if this 
policy holds as the games get tougher. 

Swim Team Up 
For Invitational 

This Saturday the UCSD men's intercollegiate swim 
ie~m will wind up its season with a tremendous 
invitational home swim meet. The meet will commence 
at 10 a.m. in UCSD's fine indoor swimming complex. 

This year's team is composed of an enthusiastic but 
limited number of students. Ralph Ausman is probably 
one of the finer all around swimmers on the team. He 
competes in a variety of events including the 500 and 
200 yard freestyle along with the tortuous and deman-
ding 100 yard fly. John Ford is UCSD's specialist in the 
freestyle events; swimming the 50, 100, and 200 yard 
free . Scott Spencer enjoys taking his time in the pool, 
swimming the 1000 yard freestyle, along with com-
peting in the 100 and 200 yard breaststroke. Eric 
R demans is one of the sprinters on the team, also 
competing in the 50 and 100 yard free . Other swimmers 
on the team include Steve Alexander, Pixie Norris 
(when he's not out life-guarding), Dave Donaldson, 
Harry Starcevics, and Steve Wirth. . 

Th t am will wind u it competition against 
Champman College, Tijuana Tech, and a group of dU-
star swimmers composed of former Olympic and AA U 
champion, known a the La Jolla Irregular. Their 
stiffest competition should come from the La Jolla 
Irr ~gulars, whi h f atur such talent a Howard Hunt , 
Fr d Beck r, T rry Fowler (one of the fine t girl 
wimmer in the area) and pr ident of th n wly-

formed UC D L tt rman ' Club and frat rnity, Mark 
liska.

Revelle Cafeteria ... 
discovery of :ood enroute outside, levy 
the $10.00 fine which exists on the books 
for this offen:,e. Now obviously, neither 
of these methods appears to be a decent 
way to run a cafeteria. It is our hope to 
maintain the cafeteria as an enjoyable 
place in which to eat, and not create a 
prison cafeteria. 

step would be for the students who use 
the cafeteria, to work together and in-
dividuillly, to prevent the removal of 
food from the premises. If each ~tudent 
were to take the responsibility not to 
remove food from the cafeteria, and 
discourage others from the same, there 
would be no need to take any sort of 
action at all. 

There is only one other option that is 
open to us, then, in preventing the 
removal of items from the cafeteria, and 
that is, to discontinue serving the types 
of items that are easily removed. This 
would mean the discontinuance of fresh 
fruit , containers of ice-cream, cookies, 
danish, donuts, cake, and so forth . 

And so, we most earnestly request a ll 
students to consider the alternatives, 
and in the future, eat your fill while in 
the cafeteria, and abstain from removing 
food from the premises, so that the 
cafeteria may continue to provide the 
quality of food we have enjoyed thus fa r. 

The only way we can avoid taking this

as such he lives most of his

The science-fiction club at UCSD felt that Friday 
night Flicks and those shown on Saturday were not 
sufficient for real movie-goers. They are correcting this 
deficiency with their own set of movies t.o be shown on 
Sunday nights in USB 2722. 

This Sunday they will show a full length color feature, 
" Bell, Book and Candle" and a short, "Occurrence at 
Owl Creek Bridge." 

"Bell, Book and Candle" is a comedy starring Jack 
lemmon, lames Stewart and Kim Novak, It concerns 
the funny escapades of a witch, Kim Novak. Her powers 
of witchcraft create complications beyond compare in 
the life of Stewart and lemmon.

An outstanding Game was played by one and all. 

In other games that day the UCSD econds were 
defeated by the San Diego Rugby Club 16-11. Brad 
Iwanaga and Pugnacious Ric Pope scored tries for 
UCSD and Charlie Tuna scored a penality kick . In the 
thirds game, San Diego State's second's won 23-8. Bill 
Meister scored UCSD's only try. All three games were 
excellent rugby games with close and vigorous com-
petition and fine sportsmanship. 

"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge" is an intense 
film portraying the agony and anguish of the Civil War. 
The viewer watches with his heart-in-throat as a soldier 
tries to escape death-b.y,-drowning in the Owl Creek. 
The underwater scene in particular will leave viewers 
breathless.
