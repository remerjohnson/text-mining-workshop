WHEN ORGANIZED PARTY PLANNING GOES WRONG ▶ OPINION, PAGE 4

The University of California 
was recognized by the California 
Sustainability Alliance last week 
when the environmental agency pre-
sented the UC system with its pres-
tigious Excellence in Sustainability 
Showcase Award, an honor highlight-
ing the university’s ongoing efforts 
to implement sustainable practices 
throughout its numerous campuses 
and research institutions.

Since 2002, the UC system has 
vowed commitment to a green cam-
paign designed to bring the 10 cam-
pus system up to speed with mod-
ern sustainability practices and to 
place the university at the forefront 
of college-led environmental efforts.

By late fall of this year, the 
California Supreme Court is expect-
ed to reach a decision regarding a 
lawsuit filed by several out-of-state 
UC students against the UC Board 
of Regents that challenges a contro-
versial state law providing in-state 
tuition rates to undocumented stu-
dents. 

Passed in 2001, Assembly Bill 
540 allows non-California residents 
who graduate from a California high 
school to pay student fees at the rate 
reserved for in-state students after 
attending the university for three 
or more years, an amount rougly 
$20,000 less than that paid by out-of-
state students. The law also applies to 
undocumented immigrants, a loop-
hole that raised public outcry after 
the bill’s passage and eventually led to 
the lawsuit now presented before the 
Supreme Court. 

Martinez vs. Regents of the 
University of California, first filed in 
a Yolo County court in 2005, accuses 
the university of violating section 
505 of the 1996 Illegal Immigration 
Reform and Immigrant Responsibility 
Act, which states that illegal immi-
grants, regardless of residency status, 
should not be granted any postsec-
ondary education benefits unless all 
United States citizens are provided 
with the same rights.

“Out-of-state students have to pay 
$20,000 for California tuition while 
illegal aliens benefiting from AB 540 
have to pay only $8,000 [per year],” 
said Michael Brady, the plaintiffs’ 
attorney. “Most Americans under-
stand that sometimes illegals and 
citizens are given the same rights, 
but when they are treated four times 
better than citizens, it becomes an 
issue.”

The American Federation of 
Teachers on behalf of UC librar-
ians will continue a series of talks 
with the university administration 
regarding salary increases next 
month, following a set of negotia-
tions Jan. 9 that failed to satisfy the 
union’s demands.

“Several points were made ear-
lier this month,” chief negotiator 
for UC librarians Mike Rotkin said. 
“Once again, we have demonstrated 

extensively to the administration 
that University of California librar-
ians are tens of thousands of dol-
lars behind their [California State 
University], [community college] 
and public library counterparts in 
terms of salaries. However, we have 
now reduced our demands, lowering 
our salary expectations by 10K for 
our top-tier librarians.”

Rotkin said that while the univer-
sity continues to receive budget cuts 
and the state remains in a deficit, 
the university sits on approximately 
$6 billion in unrestricted assets that 
could be used to pay UC librarians a 
total of $5 million in salary increases 
annually. 

“It’s not a matter of if we have the 
money or not,” Rotkin said. “It’s a 
matter of priorities. The university

In an effort to attract more low-
income students in tense economic 
times, the UC Board of Regents will 
consider next week establishing a 

minimum level of gift assistance for 
undergraduates whose families earn 
below the state median household 
income of $60,000.

Under UC President Mark G. 
Yudof ’s proposal — known as the 
Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan 
— undergraduates with qualifying 
household incomes would receive at 
least enough scholarship and grant 
aid to fully cover systemwide fees. 
The program would last four years 
for beginning undergraduates and 
two years for California community-
college transfer students.

Students with sufficient financial 
need would receive additional grant 
assistance to cover books, housing, 
food, transportation and other edu-
cational expenses.

The offer would benefit 1,100 
students, including some currently 
enrolled whose state and federal aid 
falls short of the university’s tuition, 
which stands at $7,126 this year.

In a statement Thursday, Yudof 
said that while a large amount of 
financial assistance is already avail-
able, UC students and their parents 
possess only a “vague” understand-

ing of how it works.
“Despite having a robust finan-

cial-aid program and enrolling more 
low-income students than any other 
top research university, UC must 
be able to counter effectively the 
perception that our costs, especially 
our fee charges, make us financially 
inaccessible to students of modest 
means,” Yudof said. “The proposal’s 
goal is to make sure lower-income 
families no longer need to worry 
about how they will cover UC’s basic

Four-year legal battle 
moves from local court

complete coverage of UC
systemwide fees.

Librarians at the University of California began salary negotiations with UC representatives last year, 
alleging that higher pay at other public institutions is pulling talent away from the university.

2 NEWS THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, JANUARY 26, 2009

An embryonic stem-cell ther-
apy developed by a UC Irvine-
led research team was recently 
approved by the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration for clinical trial 
in patients with acute spinal cord 
injury. The treatment will be the 
world’s first embryonic stem-cell 
treatment created for testing in 
humans. 

“This trial was approved only 
after rigorous safety testing and 
consultation of countless experts 
in the field,” said Hans Keirnstead, 
lead researcher and co-director of 
the UC Irvine Sue and Bill Gross 
Stem-Cell Research Center. “Any 
benefit to the patient, even an incre-
mental one, would be a resounding 
victory.”

Keirnstead developed a tech-
nique that prompts human embry-
onic stem cells to develop into 
oligodendrocyte cells. Paralysis 
results when these cells, the build-
ing blocks of myelin, are damaged 
or stripped away due to injury or 

disease.
In 2005, the treatment was suc-

cessful in reversing the paralysis 
of rats when Keirnstead and his 
colleagues injected them with the 
precursor embryonic stem cells. 
These cells wrapped around dam-
aged neurons in the spinal cord, 
forming new myelin tissue and 
allowing the rats to walk again. 
The findings were published in 
the Journal of Neuroscience and 
were the subject of a “60 Minutes” 
episode. 

“This is the first step along a 
road that we’re soon going to see 
turn into a race track,” Keirnstead 
said.

Pomona College President 
David W. Oxtoby banned the tradi-
tional school song “Hail, Pomona, 
Hail!” last spring after a college 
committee concluded that the song 
likely had its roots in a blackface 
minstrel show held at the college 
in 1910.

One alumni researcher arrived at 
the opposite conclusion, counter-
ing the long-asserted accusation 
based on evidence Oxtoby called 
“contradictory and open to inter-
pretation.” The president banned 
the song at commencements and 
convocations, but allowed it to be 
sung at alumni events. 

The issue resurfaced when fly-
ers were distributed on campus 
last February pointing out that 
the song’s lyrics, which do not 
contain offensive language, were 
written for a blackface minstrel 
show intended to fundraise for the 
baseball team. 

The decision proved controver-
sial when Pomona College alumnus 
Carl Olson compared the banning 
to “having your baby shot in front 
of you.” 

“It turned into a kind of multifac-
eted travesty,” Olson said. 

Student blog the Claremont 
Conservative and news blog the 
Claremont Insider have also been 
critical of the banning, describing 
the step as a typical overreaction 
in the administration’s continued 
attempts at political correctness.

Earlier this month, the Princeton 
Review named UCSD among the 
nation’s top 10 “best value” public 
colleges for 2009.

UCSD was ranked seventh, while 
first place went to the University of 
Virginia. No other UC made the 
list. 

Selection was based on surveys 
of administrators and students at 
more than 650 colleges nationwide, 
and criteria for evaluation covered 
factors in the areas of academics, 
costs of attendance and financial 
aid. 

“Mathematics and the sciences 
reign supreme at the University 
of California, San Diego, a school 
whose excellent reputation, huge 
research budgets and idyllic climate 
have helped it attract eight Nobel 
laureates to its faculty,” the report 
said. “While research and graduate 
study garner most of the attention, 
undergraduates still receive a solid 
education that results in an impres-
sive degree.”

The students who filed the law-
suit, now all UC graduates and some 
with outstanding student loans, have 
been fighting AB 540 for eight years 
and plan to continue with the suit 
until they receive full reimbursement 
for their college tuitions. Brady, who 
represents 42 students and their par-
ents, says there are 100,000 more out-
of-state students who have been dis-
criminated against by AB 540 since 
its implementation in January 2002. 
Brady said that if the suit does not 
succeed in the California Supreme 
Court, the case will be taken to the 
United States Supreme Court.

“You can never determine how the 
Supreme Court will rule, but we’re 
being hopeful,” Brady said. “Federal 
law is clear, and California’s AB 540 is 
in blatant violation of it.”

If AB 540 is repealed, the finan-
cial consequence for students cur-
rently benefiting from the bill will be 
significant. On average, out-of-state 
tuition is $20,600 more than in-state 
tuition for UC students, $10,000 
more for CSU students and roughly 
$144 more at community colleges. 

“If the California Supreme Court 
strikes down AB 540, the UC will 
have to start charging hundreds of 
students out-of-state tuition who 
aren’t being charged now because 

they are protected by the bill,” uni-
versity counsel Chris Patti said. “Most 
of these students aren’t even illegal 
immigrants — they are United States 
citizens who fit all the qualifications 
of the measure.”

Although AB 540 did not original-
ly apply to UC campuses, the regents 
formulated a policy to align the uni-
versity with other colleges in the state 
shortly after the bill passed. Patti, one 
of the lawyers currently defending 
the university in the suit over AB 540, 
said that although the measure allows 
undocumented immigrants certain 
benefits, 70 percent of the students 
covered by the law are actually United 
States citizens.

“The AB 540 opponents are con-
veniently focusing on the undocu-
mented students that just happen 
to also benefit from the bill, but fail 
to recognize that two-thirds of the 
students are actually United States 
citizens,” said Nicholas Espiritu, an 
attorney for the Mexican American 
Legal Defense and Educational 
Fund. “We just want to make sure 
all students have realistic access to 
college. We need a new, educated 
workforce — especially with today’s 
economy.”

student fees.”
The Blue and Gold Opportunity 

Plan would cost the university an 
estimated $3.1 million per year, and 
would be funded by increasing the 
amount of fee revenue reserved for 
financial aid from 33 percent to 36 
percent.

Next month, the regents will also 
consider a 10 percent increase in sys-
temwide fees.

The university currently provides 
scholarship and grant assistance aver-
aging $10,300 per student to 54 per-
cent of its 173,000 undergraduates. 

According to Yudof, the new plan 
would not affect undergraduates with 
household incomes between $60,000 
and $100,000, who receive an aver-
age of $5,800 in grants per year. The 
university will continue to provide 
enough grant assistance to defray at 
least half the annual increase in fees 
for these students, he said.

The regents are scheduled to 
discuss the proposal at their Feb. 
3 through Feb. 5 meeting in San 
Francisco.

has already allocated salary increas-
es for university police, legal council, 
executives and members of AFSCME 
— the American Federation of State 
County and Municipal Employees 
— so why not us?” 

So far, the university has offered 
its librarians a 1 percent increase 
in professional development funds. 
University negotiators, follow-
ing the latest round of talks earlier 
this month, have agreed to seek an 
increased salary offer from the uni-
versity by this February. 

“UC librarians maintain research 
resources essential to any research 
university, updating data on the 
Internet, digitalizing resources and 
specializing in specific areas of study 
— ranging from romantic poetry to 
African-American history — so that 
they can make available the most 
contemporary and current resources 
to researchers in their specific fields,” 
UC Santa Cruz librarian Ken Ryans 
said. “If the UC continues to provide 
lower salaries than those offered at 
competing institutions, I think we 
will eventually see a demise in the 
educational quality and research 
capabilities of the university.”

Rotkin said that in the past, uni-
versity librarians have never been 
this mobilized and demanding.

“They don’t go on strike and they 
don’t rattle cages, but for the first time 
I think that we are a bit more orga-
nized and mobilized, especially with 
the union buttons, T-shirts, letters 
and demonstrations — it’s nice to see 
them speaking up,” Rotkin said. “We 

only number around 400 librarians 
in the entire UC system, so with our 
small numbers, we inevitably have 
less clout when demanding things 
like salary renegotiations. The UC 
has promised pay increases over the 
past five years, but so far we have only 
experienced 2 percent annual raises 
over three of the last five years, and 0 
percent raises over the other two.” 

Rotkin said that the universi-
ty has neglected to perform exit 

interviews for those librarians 
who decided to leave over the past 
decade, allegedly leaving the univer-
sity unaware of growing problems in 
recruitment and retention that have 
resulted from inequitable salaries 
between UC librarians and their 
counterparts at other educational 
institutions. 

“The trouble we are currently 
experiencing in filling librarian 
positions among university cam-
puses is due to increased awareness 
by librarians that the UC system 

is no longer paying as well as the 
CSU system or many community 
colleges,” Ryans said. “I have seen 
colleagues leave positions at the 
University of California to take up 
positions offered at local state uni-
versities and community colleges 
because they pay significantly better. 
There is absolutely no incentive for 
librarians to work at the University 
of California if competing educa-
tional institutions within the same 
vicinity offer better pay and com-
pensations.”

UC-AFT negotiators have arranged 
to meet with university representa-
tives again next month in hopes of 
expanding on the university’s current 
offer of a 1 percent increase to profes-
sional development funds. 

According to Rotkin, UC nego-
tiators have emphasized that an 
increase in librarian salaries is sim-
ply not a priority for the university 
at the present time. 

However, UC spokesman Paul 
Schwartz emphasized that the uni-
versity is willing to continue nego-
tiations in hopes of better addressing 
UC-AFT demands.

“While I cannot comment on the 
specifics of these past negotiations, 
the university does recognize the vital 
role librarians serve in fulfilling its 
commitments to academic research 
and development,” Schwartz said. 
“We will further pursue negotiations 
in an attempt to better address the 
demands presented by UC-AFT.”

UC Librarians Hold Out for Further Salary Negotiations

The UC Board of Regents approved 
the Green Building Policy and Clean 
Energy Standards in 2003, cement-
ing this commitment into university 
policy. 

“Thanks to the leadership of stu-
dents, faculty, staff and the regents, 
the University of California has 
embraced sustainability and con-
tinues to trans-
form business 
practices to fur-
ther reduce our 
environmenta l 
impact and fight 
global warming,” 
UC President 
Mark G. Yudof 
said in a state-
ment. “We’re 
grateful for this 
recognition of 
our efforts and 
hope that it will 
help to bring 
more attention to sustainability 
efforts throughout California.”

The regents’ adoption of these 
policies has since resulted in efforts 
throughout the UC system to imple-
ment energy-saving technology in 
new and existing buildings, invest in 
local renewable-energy sources such 
as solar and hydrogen power and cut 
greenhouse-gas admissions dramati-
cally over the next decade. 

Initiated several years ago as a 
student-led environmental campaign 
aligned with global environmentalist 

organization Greenpeace, the uni-
versity’s attempts at adopting green-
oriented policy have since gained 
national attention for the public high-
er education system. The Princeton 
Review named the University of 
California among its most “green” 
colleges last year, while several envi-
ronmental agencies have recognized 
the university as a leader in sustain-

ability projects.
At UCSD, 

Vice Chancellor 
of Resource 
Management and 
Planning Gary 
C. Matthews has 
overseen a num-
ber of sustain-
ability initiatives, 
including the 
construction of 
solar panels atop 
several campus 
parking structures 
and the installa-

tion of two 1.2 megawatt hydrogen 
cells on east campus. Additionally, 
the recent passage of the A.S. stu-
dent activity fee referendum will 
provide several thousand dollars in 
funding to the upcoming campus 
Sustainability Center, an initiative 
approved by administrators last year 
that will serve as a central resource 
for various student environmental 
organizations on campus.

Case Overlooks Educated Immigrants’ Value
By Ashley Lee
Contributing Writer

STATE NEWS — Embedded in the 
California Supreme Court’s recent 
decision to review a lawsuit challeng-
ing in-state college tuition rates for 
illegal immigrants is the age-old ques-
tion of fairness. But by considering a 
verdict that will decide hundreds of 
undocumented students’ future — no 
matter how many out-of-state stu-
dents say they’ve taken legal action 
against the UC Board of Regents to 
achieve a more evenhanded system 
— the debate boils down to money: 
Who has it and who doesn’t?

In 2005, over 40 out-of-state stu-
dents sued the regents regarding a 
discrepancy between California’s 
Assembly Bill 540, a law that makes 
illegal immigrants eligible to pay 
in-state tuition rates, and the Illegal 
Immigration Reform and Immigrant 
Responsibility Act of 1996, the federal 
law forbidding any type of postsec-
ondary education benefit for illegal 
immigrants over United State citi-
zens.  Since the case’s dismissal, the 
California Court of Appeals has over-
ruled the decision made orginally by a 
Yolo County court and forwarded the 
case to the California Supreme Court.

The case’s plaintiffs plead for the 
abolition of AB540, as well as the 
unrealistic monetary reimbursement 

for the supposedly unfair rates they 
paid while in college. However, their 
goal is futile since declaring AB540 
unconstitutional wouldn’t make out-
of-state tuition rates any less expen-
sive. Essentially, both parties will 
struggle to pay an annual $28,600 in 
out-of-state tuition. 

Opponents argue that AB540 
contradicts federal law because they 
assume it only benefits illegal immi-
grants. Since its passage in 2001, 
California’s public universities and 
community college system have guar-
anteed in-state tuition to any student 
who attended a California high school 
for three years or more, graduated in 
state and enrolled in a California 
public university. If undocumented, 
the student must sign a proclama-
tion with his or her university to 
apply for permanent residency once 
eligible, upon which implementation 
is foreseen by the university. The 
bill was created specifically with the 
mentioned federal law in mind, and 
extends its benefits to out-of-state stu-
dents by including those who attend 
California boarding schools or stu-
dents whose parents leave California 
immediately following their child’s 
high-school graduation.

In 2007, there were approximately 
1,639 AB540 students in the UC sys-
tem, 72 percent of whom were already 
documented. The remaining 459 stu-

dents signed an affidavit promising 
the UC system to apply for legal 
status immediately upon eligibility 
and have already taken the first steps 
toward residency, such as contacting 
a legal immigration lawyer, according 
to a 2008 UC report.  These students’ 
tuition rates are conditional as long 
as they are continue toward attaining 
legal status and can be raised to non-
resident rates if the university believes 
the student is taking the grace period 
for granted. Compared to the remain-
ing 166,054 students with legal citi-
zenship, limiting a handfull of ambi-
tious students who are prepared to 
take on the same responsibilities and 
pay the same taxes that legal residents 
do would hurt our state’s economy 
rather than help it. These students 
are only trying to continue the pub-
lic education that California taxpay-
ers have supported their entire lives, 
since fundamental education (grades 
K-12) was declared a fundamental 
and protected right under a 1982 fed-
eral Supreme Court ruling. The state 
has already devoted so much to these 
students that it might as well finish 
the investment and collect its profits 
through the taxes students will pay 
upon residency. 

In a starving system,  it seems 
illogical to offer illegal immigrants 
monetary aid. However, raising 
tuition fees for illegal immigrants 
— a decision that will undoubtedly 

add $10,000 to $20,000 more to a 
college education price tag — would 
disregard the potential benefits these 
eventual graduates can contribute to 
the state. Yes, current Californians 
are paying taxes for their education 
now, but today’s undocumented stu-
dents will be tomorrow’s taxpayer 
once eligible and earning income of 
their own.  It’s unrealistic to assume 
that students who have not only grad-
uated from California public high 
schools but also meet minimum col-
lege requirements will simply pack 
up and leave the country once col-
lege costs deny them a higher educa-
tion. So, rather than condemn these 
already-motivated students to a sub-
par position in society, why not cash 
in on the money taxpayers spent to 
support their primary education and 
give them an opportunity to excel?

While out-of-state students com-
plain about the outrageous loans they 
must bear to afford a Californian 
education (an optional luxury in the 
first place), illegal immigrants are 
left to come up with tuition money 
without access to typical grants, loans 
and scholarships. Expecting that ille-
gal immigrants could come up with 
this money is unrealistic. Most illegal 
immigrant families are not mem-
bers of high society, and AB540 was 
created to lend a helping hand to 

Bureaucratic 
Meetings 

Won’t Clean 
Up Beer Cans
In my days as a high-school activ-ity whore, hour-long meetings on whether the spirit club should 
sell Pepsi or Coke (or in some 
extremely experimental instances, 
both) at an upcoming fundraiser 
versed me in two concepts that go 
hand-in-hand: bullshit and bureau-
cracy. By the end of my enthusiastic 
four-year legacy as activity director 
or student representative in the most 
useless of organizations, questioning 
the importance of a discussion on 
club T-shirt designs was equivalent 
to stabbing a dagger in my heart and 
screaming, “You don’t matter!”

Simply put, the endless red tape 
and paperwork that made my life 
complicated also gave it meaning. Of 
course after some personal distance 
from the system in college, I real-
ized my energy could be used more 
constructively (i.e. getting efficiently 
trashed on weekends). But even after 
resisting memberships to the most 
prolific poster-making clubs, I can’t 
help but be jealous of the superficial 
license bureaucracy offers in the 
professional workplace.

Consider, for instance the 
cashier at the 10-item-or-less aisle 
in your local Ralphs supermarket. 
Historically, I’ve always tried to test 
my limits with these employees, fill-
ing a basket full of, get this: 15 or 
more items and strolling into line 
like I own the place. Usually I get 
by with the raise of an eyebrow or 
a polite reminder to use the correct 
aisle next time. But one memorable 
visit, I shoved well over 10 items 
into my cart, skipped the long lines 
and unloaded my groceries onto the 
express conveyor belt aisle to meet a 
curt worker with a Russian accent. 

After she scanned my 10th item, 
she stopped and asked me if I’d 
counted my groceries. I apologized 
and lied that I hadn’t noticed, anx-
ious for her to finish up the transac-
tion. But before I could swipe my 
debit card she pressed a register 
button, cancelled my sale and told 
me to get in another line. I was so 
shocked by her firm 10 item stance 
that I didn’t even argue. As I silently 
gathered my items and took a posi-
tion in a normal line, I couldn’t help 
but be impressed with her over-
whelming authority. 

In the end it probably would’ve 
been more efficient if she’d let me 
slide by with a surplus of groceries, 
but the fact that she took her job’s 
responsibilities so seriously made 
me respect her more. If she couldn’t 
tell 11 item customers to get out of 
her line, then what could she do? It’s 
about the small victories. 

I’m all for a little personal self-
worth, whether it comes from 
rejecting a misbehaving customer 
or telling someone to fill out a writ-
ten complaint, but when the righ-
teous attitudes of the organized pro-
fessional world start bleeding into 
social events, say, the sexy dance 
party that my housemates and I 
threw last week, things stop being 
impressive and start getting annoy-
ing.

ON-CAMPUS — As UCSD students, 
our greatest safety threats seem to 
stem from the suspiciously restless 
squirrels that rustle on late-night 
walks back from Geisel Library — or, 
perhaps, the occasional seagull that 
chooses to relieve itself while flying 
over Library Walk.

Though the UCPD reports that in 
2007 there were 18 recorded instanc-
es of on-campus physical assault, it’s 
safe to say a good chunk of those can 
be attributed to drunken roommates 
who’d had it up to here with each 
other’s rotting silverware. Overall, 
violence — the most fear-inspir-
ing of the crime-report categories 
— accounted for a scant 4.23 percent 

of total on-campus crime that year; 
and though the seriousness of the 
much more popular property crime 
(a reported 95.77 percent of on-cam-
pus crime for the same year) is not to 
be ignored, it doesn’t 
exactly make UCSD 
the next “Cops” 
candidate, and isn’t 
quite enough to 
strike curdling fear 
into our hearts on 
those 3 a.m. treks to 
Burger King.

Indeed, though 
the campus police 
force is still com-
prised of a 36 per-
son staff (supervi-
sion and manage-
ment included) and 
operates on a con-
siderable $3.4 mil-
lion annual budget, 
our cops don’t see nearly the amount 
of violent crime that more urban 
officers do. As a point of reference, 
the UCPD reports that in 2006, the 
rate of violent crime in California was 

518.4 instances for every population 
of 100,000; at UCSD, on the other 
hand, it was 6.96. (So, theoretically, 
the average Californian is surrounded 
by 74 times more violent crime than 

we are. Guess those 
diarrhetic seagulls 

aren’t so bad after 
all.)

UCSD police 
Chief Orville King 
credits this dis-
parity to UCSD’s 
demographic, a 
gathering of indi-
viduals with the 
common goal of 
receiving a high-
quality education, 
and in a quaint 
beach town whose 
Web site modestly 
sums it up as an 
“exquisite combi-

nation of a southern European resort 
atmosphere and Southern California 
fun.”

By comparison, UC Berkeley 
(where sleep, one may presume, is 

more often interrupted by sirens than 
giggly student-org rebels on their way 
back from a Shores bonfire) saw 12.5 
times more violent crime than UCSD 
— understandable, considering we’re 
essentially bubbled in by the nation’s 
most homogenously wealthy popula-
tion. But even UC Santa Barbara’s 
rate of violent crime was an alarming 
637 percent of UCSD’s. 

In fact, it seems the lack of violent 
crime on campus is so severe, that 
nonviolent incidents are treated by 
those on the second tier of campus 
security — namely, those employed 
by the UCSD Bookstore and, to a 
far lesser degree, the dining halls 
— as outrageous threats to the greater 
good. 

According to Steven Casad, 
director of on-campus dining ser-
vices, UCSD’s dining halls take loss 
prevention very seriously, but not at 
high expense: Security is maintained 
entirely through surveillance moni-
tors plainly visible upon entrance and 
the existing staff of cashiers, managers

For lack of serious 
on-campus crime, the 
UCSD Bookstore takes 
petty theft a little too 
seriously.

So, theoretically, the 
average Californian 
is surrounded by 74

crime than we are. 

Guess those diarrhetic 
seagulls aren’t so bad 

after all.

JAYMEE NGERNWICHIT/GUARDIAN



MONDAY, JANUARY 26, 2009 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5

was simple and sweet: we would 
have music and people would dance. 
But after some private side conver-
sations within the household, an 
official meeting was called four days 
before the event. 

As we all sat around our din-
ner table to discuss logistics, one 
housemate took out a piece of paper 
and began taking minutes. Another 
immediately expressed concern that 
we would have noise complaints 
and recommended that we cover 
our walls with sleeping bags and 
blankets. Someone else was wor-
ried our house 
e n v i r o n m e n t 
wasn’t danceable 
and suggested we 
remedy this prob-
lem by purchas-
ing decorations. 
Twenty minutes 
into a conversa-
tion on streamers 
and strobe lights, I 
realized that I had 
been transplanted 
back to the lengthy 
conversations that 
characterized my 
high school extra-
curricular activities. As responsi-
bilities mounted to an unreasonable 
level, I announced that my main 
concern was sufficient booze and 
walked upstairs.

As the date of the party 
approached, my fellow party plan-
ners took more and more liber-
ties. First I came home to a find 
my dining room wall covered in 
cellophane. Next, my kitchen light 
was replaced with a black light. But  
when I saw an entire bag of glitter 
resting on the counter, waiting to be 
shoved into our apartment’s every 
crevice, I finally said something. 

“What on Earth,” I asked my 
over-enthused housemate, “are you 
going to do with that?”

He said he was going to spread 
it everywhere and as self-appointed 
decorator he would take full respon-
sibilities for his actions. I couldn’t 
help but think of some other self-
appointed position that might give 
me the authority to throw the bag of 
glitter in the garbage.

Although our planning became 
an unnecessary source of tension 
in the days leading up to the event, 
everyone’s efforts fell into place on 
the big night. My dance-concerned 

housemates had 
moved our fur-
niture onto our 
patio, the deco-
rator had set out 
candy necklaces 
on the counter 
beside mounds of 
glitter and, most 
importantly, I was 
well on my way to 
being extremely 
drunk. For an eve-
ning we forgot our 
official positions 
and just, well, 
danced.

It wasn’t until we all woke up 
the next morning to an apartment 
covered in empty beer cans and 
multicolored confetti that it dawned 
on us: no matter how many posi-
tions we’d assigned ourselves in 
the planning process or how many 
conversations we’d had centered on 
our guests’ well-being, the inevi-
table truth was we’d planned a party, 
people got drunk and trashed our 
house and all five of us were going 
to have to clean up the mess. 

No appointed positions or meet-
ing minutes were going to get us out 
of that.

As responsibilities 
mounted to an 

unreasonable level, I 
announced that my 
main concern was 

sufficient booze and 
walked upstairs. 

these individuals: high-school stu-
dents who have attended elemen-
tary and secondary schools in this 
state but cannot obtain an affordable 
college education because they are 
required to pay nonresident tuition 
rates. Without the support of the 
state to help them achieve, they’ll 
fall through opportunity’s cracks and 
into a lower socioeconomic status 
they may never escape.

Those who argue illegal immi-
grants should not be rewarded for 
violating official laws are simplifying 
the situation at hand. Opponents of 
the bill should consider that though 
living conditions in America may be 
better than those of their country of 

origin, illegal immigrants within the 
California school system don’t always 
choose to immigrate; rather, it’s their 
parents’ decision. Should children of 
any residency be held responsible for 
the actions of a previous generation? 

AB540 does not encourage citi-
zens of other countries to break the 
law by illegally entering America, as 
some argue, because they are already 
here as a result of someone else’s early 
actions. Slapping the wrist of an irre-
sponsible party won’t bring California 
any closer to regulating immigration 
problems, but it will prevent willing 
and valuable potential citizens from 
actually benefiting the state.

Let’s face it: Illegal immigrants 
are in our country and we might 

as well follow through with taxpay-
ers’ 13 year investments by helping 
them attain the higher education 
that they’ve been working toward all 
throughout our fundamental public 
school systems.  

While this California state law 
might seem to contradict U.S. federal 
law at first glance, the access it grants 
to illegal immigrants is not creating 
the United States’ immigration situ-
ation. AB540 is a step toward help-
ing illegal immigrants who we deem 
the problem to become people who 
might be able to solve the problem in 
the future.

O P I N I O N and servers. Casad pragmatically said if theft were to become a major cost issue (which, in the year and a half he’s spent at his current post, it has 
not), food prices would simply go up. 

That, he said, would take quite a 
few stolen bananas. 

Shrouded in all the epic serious-
ness of Price Center, however, the 
UCSD Bookstore is forced to take a 
much harsher approach. According 
to a comprehensive PowerPoint 
report by the Ratex Users Group (an 
organization through which colle-
giate retailers share business strate-
gies so as to ensure maximum profit-
ability), the Bookstore employed a 
10 person staff devoted entirely to 
loss prevention for the 2003-04 fiscal 
year. That same year, the report said, 
the Bookstore detained 76 suspected 
thieves and recovered $7,308 in lost 
property — amounting to a whop-
ping 0.02 percent of its $35 million in 
posted sales.

Though the Bookstore did not 
respond to requests for comment 
press time, the publically available 
Ratex presentation includes visuals 
of an employee monitoring a 54 cam-
era surveillance system, along with 
a team of loss-prevention specialists 
who put to use the most advanced 
security techniques — including, it’s 
reported, masquerading as customers 
— in order to most discretely patrol 

the bloodthirsty pack of common 
criminals who apparently stalk the 
Bookstore at all hours of the day and 
night.

Though it seems there’s no pos-
sible way all the costly prevention 
measures could pay off the manpower 
they require, one has to desire their 

efficiency. There are an embarrass-
ing number of instances in which 
students are detained, interrogated, 
carted off to prison — basically every-
thing short of eternal damnation 
— over something as petty as a $10 
“UCSD Grandma” coffee mug, all for 
the cause of publically condemning 
the mortal sin of shrinkage (or, for the 
less capitalist minded, the loss of rev-
enue through shoplifting). On March 
21, 2007 police reported a Japanese 
female in her 20s was “detained for 

allegedly taking a pen from the Price 
Center Bookstore” — and may she 
serve as an example for all.

Of course, the Bookstore is as enti-
tled as any paranoid corporation to 
actively work toward reducing theft. 
But should there really be undercover 
employees defending bluebooks and 
hoodies to the death? Other campus 
stores, such as Earl’s Place, use surveil-
lance monitors visible to customers 
— at least offering the peace of mind 
that comes from not being stalked 
by a hidden robotic eye. Certainly, 
no university-affiliated retailer would 
want to create an environment of anx-
iety for its hordes of tuition-shoveling 
undergraduates; after all, that’s not 
conducive to spending one’s parents’ 
hard-earned cash.

The root issue lies, it seems, in 
the fact that on such a nonviolent 
campus, security officials would be 
out of a job if they didn’t scrutinize 
less extreme breaches of security and 
safety. Blame the natural perfection 
of our pretty little La Jolla ’hood, or 
lack of diversionary doughnut shops, 
but we possess the privilege of living 
in such a sheltered community that 
there are times, it appears, when we 
pay at the mercy of law enforcement 
all too ready to make something out 
of nothing.

S usumi Tsuchihashi graduated from Eleanor Roosevelt College in June 2001 with a bachelor’s degree in management 
science. After working for seven years at one of 
the largest global consulting firms, he traded 
in his 401(k) lifestyle for the opportunity to 
open a imagawa-yaki shop that specializes 
in contemporary Japanese pastries.

“When I was in college, I never thought 
to myself, ‘I’m studying at UCSD in the 
economics department because I want to 
be a pastry chef in a few years’,” he said. 

Tsuchihashi is one of many UCSD 
alumni who have veered  from their 
degree’s typical postgraduate course 
since attending college.

“[Many of these] people take on 
jobs that just don’t translate from what 
they majored in,” Director of Alumni 
Services Paula Thomas said. 

Similarly sidetracked alumni 
include Genetta Adams, Revelle 1992, 
who majored in theater and dance 
and is now the entertainment editor at 
the Associated Press, and Mike Judge, 
Warren 1985, who graduated with a 

degree in physics and went on to create 
the animated television series “Beavis and 

Butt-head,” along with writing and directing cult 
comedy “Office Space.” 

Although superficially their areas of study 
may not pertain to their careers, many alumni 
agree that while attending UCSD, they gleaned 
the general knowledge and experience necessary 
to get them where they are today.

“A common thread that runs through the 
highly successful and influential alumni from 
UCSD is the way they speak to the breadth of the 
education they received here that made them the 
success they are today,” said Mary Johnson, direc-
tor of alumni engagement for the UCSD Alumni 
Association. “Taking required courses such as 
writing and humanities help put these people a 
cut above the competitors in their field.”

Tsuchihashi acknowledged the eventual 
worth of his education and how it propelled him 
to take the final steps toward his goal. 

“Going through [management science] and 
entering the consulting sector helped me think 
strategically, put together business plans and 
manage large projects,” he said. “That’s what gave 
me the confidence to move forward and start my 
own business.”

‘THE TOUGHESTJOB YOU’LLEVER
LOVE

E leanor Roosevelt College alumna Charlene Pena laughed off the cliche before delivering it, as did UCSD alum-
nus Tony Chung. The Peace Corps is a 24-hour, 
seven-day-a-week job that you can’t get enough 
of, they said. 

And for years, UCSD has been rising on the 
“Peace Corps Top Colleges and Universities” 
annual list. According to Peace Corps statis-
tics,  49 alumni currently serve overseas, placing 
UCSD 18th among universities with over 15,000 
students; a total of 599 UCSD alumni have vol-
unteered with the Peace Corps in the university’s 
history.

Former volunteer Pena reflects on her two 
years in Kazakhstan from 2005 to 2007 with 
an appreciation she said she found only after 
returning home to San Diego. As her service 
began, before anyone ever heard of Borat, Pena 
had no idea where Kazakhstan was located and 
could find little information on the country. 
Volunteers don’t have the freedom to choose 
their destinations; the Peace Corps places appli-
cants according to their experience and abilities. 
Pena had worked as a teaching assistant, and 
teachers were needed in Kazakhstan. 

“It really becomes your everyday life,” she 
said. “You really have to be a leader and be inde-
pendent, to figure out things on your own. ... It’s 
the toughest job you’ll ever love.”

Pena also said the experience has made a signif-
icant impact on her current position at Survivors 
of Torture International, a nonprofit organi-

zation that 
assists victims of overseas tyranny living in San 
Diego. 

“[I am] working with a population that has 
to learn a whole new culture, and that’s what I 
had to do in the Peace Corps,” she said. “I feel 
like Peace Corps really prepares you for a lot of 
challenges.”

Chung, who was stationed in Crimea — a 
peninsula in Southern Ukraine where the pri-
mary language is Russian — from 2004 to 2006, 
relayed similar sentiments. Before departing, 
Chung didn’t speak a word of Russian, but spent 
two months in Ukraine before conversing with 
another native English speaker. Today, Chung 
tests at advanced levels in Russian language 
abilities.

“I didn’t just want to be a tourist,” Chung said. 
“I wanted to really learn a culture and live it. It 
was really good to give back and help people at 
the same time.”

As his primary job, Chung taught English as 
a foreign language, despite being a biology major. 
A lot of his additional work was related to HIV 
and AIDS, as Ukraine has the fastest-growing 
HIV infection rate in all Europe. Today, Chung 

works with a pharmaceutical company. 
Though the Peace Corps’ popularity has 

fluctuated over its 50-year legacy, participation 
is currently on the rise.

“Last year we had a 37 year high,” Peace 
Corps spokeswoman Kate Kuykendall said. 
“Applications have increased by 16 percent; that’s 
the largest increase in five years.”

Despite the rising applicant pool and an 
increased need for international humanitarian 
aid, the Peace Corps cut 10 percent of its roughly 
4,000 global positions to compensate for recent 
budget shortfalls.

According to Kuykendall, the declining value 
of the dollar and recent economic downturn 
have hit the Peace Corps hard. Nevertheless, she 
does not see the current economic situation as a 
deterrent in attracting volunteers.

“It’s always hard to say [why applicants come 
to Peace Corps], but I think students are much 
more globally minded today,” Kuykendall said. 
“I think students are more motivated by service 
— more aware of disparities in the world — and 
want to make a difference.” C ontrary to popular belief, not all internships come in the form of dead-end desk jobs of filing paper-

work 10 hours a week and eternally staring 
down the clock. With the help of many 
campus resources, students can find oppor-
tunities that are stimulating, challenging 
and even tailored specifically to their major 
or career goals. 

A few have even found themselves 
coordinating events for the “Tyra Banks 
Show,” dissecting leeches and serving sub-
poenas. 

The Career Services Center, Academic 
Internship Program and Division of 
Biological Sciences offer services to help 
students wade through endless job descrip-
tions. 

But even the 1,000 or more internships 
offered through these departments — rang-
ing from 10 to 20 hours a week, paid and 
unpaid, local and abroad— can be tough to 
handle without focus.

Through career counseling, resume cri-
tiques and internship workshops, the Career 
Services Center attempts to provide students 
with personalized assistance. Its Web site 
also hosts various internship search engines, 
such as Port Triton and ExperienceLink on 
their Internship Supersite. Updated every 
day, the three Web sites list all current 
internship positions available to UCSD stu-
dents. 

“We’re the hub for employers who want 
to recruit for UCSD talent,” Career Services 
Center Internship Coordinator Christy 
Quiogue said. “When employers have an 
opening, they contact the Career Services 
Center, and we post them on our exclusive

MONDAY, JANUARY 26, 2009 THE UCSD GUARDIAN FOCUS  9

L inda and Jim Bill’s dessert endeavor, Do It With Icing, is dually a baker’s paradise — where terms like sugar pearls and luster dust are part of the whimsi-
cal lexicon — and a haven for any sugary-treat admirer 
who wishes to learn. The shop’s motto, carved into a 
small wooden sampler above a Valentine’s Day bouquet of 
chocolate hearts, flowers and bows, “How many calories 
does this have? Who cares!” is appropriate, given this icing 
venture’s decadent nature. 

Do It With Icing is one part baking supply store, one 
part bake/decorating instruction and two parts creative 
tastiness. Despite its size, the storefront is stocked with 
thousands of ingredients and tools to enhance at-home 
baking and decorating. With all the charm of your local 
cluttered craft store, Do It With Icing has an entire aisle 
dedicated to colorful and uniquely shaped sprinkles — siz-
able portions for as low as $1.49, well below the price of 
sprinkles at Vons. 

Other traditional baking utensils like cookie cutters, 
cake pans, piping tips and candy molds are equally cheap, 
but price is almost secondary to selection. The shop also 
has a laboratory-like inventory of specialty items to help 
make these sweet treats perfect  — things like confection 
wax paper to prevent sticking, paramount crystals to keep 
your chocolate-covered strawberries from cracking and 
high-ratio shortening like Sweetex (normally available 
only to chefs) to retain a high level of sugar and liquid in 
cakes. 

Don’t quite know what to do with luster dust? Do It 
With Icing won’t leave you with egg on your face. Linda 
warmly welcomes novices and experts alike to step into 
her kitchen and take one of her many delectable classes. 
The homey cooking space — complete with a well-worn 
refrigerator sprinkled in gingerbread magnets and pictures 
of her grandson Max — is located in the back left corner 
of the store and accommodates about 15 eager bakers. For 
$60, you can take a six-week hands-on course learning to 
frost and trim a prize-winning cake. 

For those with less time or dough, Do It With Icing 
also offers one-day demos and workshops, taught by other 
experienced confectioners. (You can learn how to bake 
gluten-free desserts for $25 or how to create fancy flower 
cupcakes for $40.) For most classes, supplies are provided. 
When they aren’t, you can grab them at 10 percent off.  

Truly one of the last mom-and-pop shops around, Do 
It With Icing leaves no apron string untied. The breadth 
of materials will inspire a baking endeavor while sparing 
your wallet.

Upcoming workshop topics include making Valentine’s 
candy, Valentine’s cookies using color flow, and Easter 
chocolate wraps.

10 FOCUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, JANUARY 26, 2009

“It’s difficult to pinpoint that funda-
mental difference,” Kuykendall added. 
“I don’t think students are saying 
‘Hmm, tough job market. I think I’ll go 
live in a foreign country for two years.’”

This year, a new crop of volunteers  
are arranging to head into the field. 
Alumni Nemo Curiel, Sarah Termondt 
and Kate Hulbert are among the grad-
uates who will be heading overseas: 
Curiel is leaving for Kenya at the end 
of January, Termondt will move to the 
Dominican Republic in March and 
Hulbert is looking forward to joining 
the first team to work in Rwanda since 
the Peace Corps was forced to pull out 
in 1993. She departs Jan. 26.

“I just got the welcome book, and 
you can tell things are just getting put 
together,” Hulbert said. “It feels very 
new to all of us going, but also to the 
people organizing [the projects].”

Preparing to work with HIV and 
AIDS patients, communications major 
Hulbert, has been employed at AIDS 
Project Los Angeles. Despite prepara-
tions past volunteers agree that settling 
into a service career overseas presents 
all sorts of new challenges. 

“I’ve been familiarizing myself with 
the topic, but it will be a whole other 
thing over there with limited resourc-
es,” Hulbert said. 

According to Kuykendall, an appli-
cant’s preparation speaks loudly in the 
exhaustive selection process. 

“We’re trying to ask applicants to 
increase their volunteer experience,” 
she said. “For UCSD students think-
ing about joining Peace Corps, make 
yourself as competitive as possible 
— volunteer, teach English as a second 
language.”

applied physics and a doctorate of phi-
losophy in space science from UCSD in 
1987. He is a prominent science-fiction 
novelist and has won awards for many 
of his books, including “The Postman” 
and “The Uplift War.” Brin initially 
wanted to become a researcher and 
teacher — now, that educational path 
largely informs his creative writing.

“Of course the engineering and 
astronomy and other courses, and 
working on original research, all 
helped me to better scan the world for 
possibilities,” Brin said. “I also took 
courses in UCSD’s wonderful English 
and lit. and cognitive science depart-
ments.” 

Ira Rubenstein, Revelle 1987, cred-
its the university with his progress 
in the  field of entertainment man-
agment. He was a resident adviser 

and orientation leader, served as A.S. 
vice president and took a seat on the 
Revelle College Council, now inform-
ing his managment of diverse groups 
of people and helping him to work on 
a budget.

“Outside of that broad scope of 
classes, UCSD prepared me for the real 
world,” Rubenstein said. 

When Rubenstein first enrolled, 
he planned to major in physics to 
acheive a career goal of designing ste-
reo speakers. But taking an economics 
course during his sophomore year and 
discovering a newfound passion for 
the subject, he switched his major to 
management science. Presently, he is 
the executive vice president of Marvel 
Entertainment’s Global Digital Media 
Group. He also served as the executive 
vice president of Sony Pictures Digital 
and the vice president of marketing at 

Columbia TriStar Interactive. 
Rubenstein took a computer pro-

gramming class at UCSD in the early 
1990s, when computers were just bare-
ly entering the business world, out of 
natural curiosity. The knowledge he 
amassed from that class was invalu-
able. He later went on to play a critical 
role in developing the first Internet-
based movie marketing: While work-
ing in entertainment promotion he 
decided to market to college students, 
whom he knew would take advantage 
of free Internet access.

Tsuchihashi also attributes much of 
his success to the opportunities he took 
while attending UCSD. He participat-
ed in the Education Abroad Program 
in Tokyo, Japan, for one year, diving 
into his ancestral culture by attending 
a private culinary program on week-
ends. With his imagawa-yaki shop, 

he merges his Japanese heritage with 
Los Angeles upbringing: He has taken 
a traditional Japanese pastry, a sweet 
griddle-cake similar to a pancake, and 
revamped it with multicultural flavors 
to adapt to Los Angeles’ diverse pal-
lette.

Tsuchihashi echoes the overall sen-
timent that his UCSD education, in the 
end, expanded his career possibilities.

“Your college degree is not going to 
pin you down to your future. Being a 
management science major and taking 
tons of calculus classes — none of the 
courses apply to anything I do now,” he 
said. “But it’s the overall college experi-
ence that applies to your future goals 
and careers. It’s the bigger picture that 
totally counts.”

UCSD database of internships on Port 
Triton. We’ve also tried to create a 
consortium of opportunities on our 
Experience Web site.” 

Eleanor Roosevelt College senior 
Jacqueline Franco found success 
through the center, landing an intern-
ship at a public defender’s office after 
tailoring her resume. 

“The public defender’s office 
[internship] was hands-on,” Franco 
said. “I would serve subpoenas, get 
police reports, interview clients in 
jails, go to houses of witnesses and get 
statements and work with attorneys 
closely. It was peer mentoring and 
advising, close association of working 
with attorneys and having them guide 
you to what they want.” 

Students seeking an internship for 
academic credit are directed to the 
Academic Internship Program, where 
anyone with 90 units, a 2.5 minimum 
GPA and at least two upper-division 

courses can apply to quarter-long 
internships for either four, eight or 12 
units with a grade of Pass/No Pass.

“[In the AIP application, students} 
identify skills, some relevant courses, 
interest, focus and what is appealing 
to them,” AIP Internship Counselor 
Annie Abbott said. “We then meet 
with them for an hour to talk more 
about their goals and interests, help 
with [the] resume, cover letter and 
[the] interview and referring process.”

If a student has already obtained an 
internship, he or she may contact AIP 
to request credit for the job. 

After using AIP to land an intern-
ship with the “Tyra Banks Show,” 
Thurgood Marshall junior Raymond 
Rollan was able to indulge his interests 
in both media and political science. 

“I want to pursue entertainment 
law, so I felt that [the internship] was a 
nonconventional way to do so,” Rollan 
said. “I felt like this experience medi-
ated the two. I now understood the 

politics that went into show-making 
and teleproductions.”

Not only was Rollan able to pursue 
an internship in his fields, but was 
given the opportunity to experience 
life on the East Coast: Throughout his 
three-month internship, he resided in 
the heart of New York City. 

“Moving to NYC was in itself a big 
deal,” Rollan said. “I really got to live in 
a different area, different comfort zone. 
I got to experience what it was like to 
immerse myself in a different culture 
and experience what a real working life 
was from 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.” 

Science majors looking for a lab-
based research internship need search 
no further than UCSD’s Division of 
Biological Sciences. Besides listing  
faculty with lab-intern openings, the 
division’s Web site offers links to many 
other research internship opportuni-
ties in fields such as biotechnology. 

The division also allows students 
academic credit for their lab intern-

ships, with BISP 199. After studying  
the development of the nervous system 
in leeches, Eleanor Roosevelt College 
junior Vaibhav Konanur found his 
class material to be more accessible. 

“In the lab, I used an enzyme to 
choose a protein,” Konanur said. “We 
learned about how that happened in 
metabolic biochemistry. It was a back-
wards way of learning. I didn’t know 
the mechanism of how the enzyme 
chose the protein when I first used it.” 

As a bonus, Konanur’s internship 
allowed him to discover his field of 
interest under a new light. 

“My career plan was to study and 
become a doctor,” Konanur said. 
“Now, I’m rethinking and reconsider-
ing my career path to do research in 
the future. So I’m still going to med 
school, but maybe after my M.D., [I’ll] 
do research.”

Misanthrope is set in the fashionable social 
milieu of seventeenth-century Paris. Alceste, 
the misanthrope of the title, is disgusted by 
the hypocrisy, injustice, and overall corruption 
in human society. Alceste’s concern with the 
issue of justice has to do with the fact that he 
is embroiled in several lawsuits, the outcomes 
of which are determined not by which party is 
in the right but by who has the most influence 
in court. Nonetheless, Alceste is in love with 
Celimene, a young widow with a reputation 
for flirtation and for surrounding herself with 
suitors and who is a prime example of the insin-
cerity that Alceste despises in others.  Students:

Nickel Eye - When The Strokes’ hiatus began 
taking longer than expected, the band’s bass-
ist, Nikolai Fraiture, reached into an old shoe-
box of poems and rants written years ago. 
With his free time, he began adapting them 
to music. Enlisting the help of South, a UK 
band introduced to him by a friend, Nickel 
Eye recorded some demos at South Studios 
in Hackney, London. With some guest appear-
ances by Nick Zinner of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs 
and Regina Spektor, The Time of the Assassins 
was completed a few months later in New York 
City. The album is written and produced by 
Nickel Eye. It is musically inspired by some of 
his favorite artists, such as Neil Young, Frank 
Black, Leonard Cohen and The Kinks and will 
be released January 27th, 2009 on Rykodisc.

14 SPORTS THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, JANUARY 26, 2009

eight points apiece.
“We kept things very simple,” 

Elliott said. “We talked about how 
we need to make free throws and 
make layups — and we do that every 
day. Those were the two things we 
talked about because had we made 
our free throws in the first half, it 
would have been much different 
going into halftime. I think we just 
had a lot of nerves. This was a big 
rivalry game for us and our nerves 
got us a little over overanxious.”

Friday’s game against Cal State 
Stanislaus showcased Elliott’s 
seemingly simple strategy. UCSD 
finished 12 of 29 from the field 
and forced the Warriors into 10 
first-half turnovers, which the 
Tritons capitalized on for 11 points. 
UCSD also had success at the line, 
shooting 12 more free throws than 
Stanislaus. 

Leading by a three-point mar-
gin at 20-17 with eight minutes to 
play, the Tritons went on a 19-10 
run to outscore the Warriors 39-27. 
Senior forward Michelle Osier had 
an explosive start, delivering 20 
of her game-high 26 points in the 
first half. 

Meanwhile, it took a little longer 
for Gaskin to jumpstart her game 
as the Warriors’ defense buckled 
down on center to keep her score-
less during the first half. That 
changed immediately after halftime 
when she converted one jumper 
and two layups into six points for 
the Tritons. 

“Alexis Gaskin did a great job of 
recognizing when they were double 
and triple teaming her and finding 
open shooters,” Elliott said. “In the 
second half, I thought that they 
weren’t able to double down quite 
as much because we had hit some 
shots from the perimeter.”  

Up 52-36 and 13 minutes into 
the second half, the game quickly 

soared out of the Warriors’ reach as 
UCSD notched points from seven 
players. 

 “We had different people step 
up tonight,” Elliott said. “[Junior 
forward] Kristen Cabral missed 
some easy shots, but her energy 
and her intensity gave us some very 
good minutes. [Carlisle] hit some 
big threes when they were trying to 
double down on our posts.” 

On fire from behind the three-
point line, Carlisle shot 4-of-5, 
contributing a total 12 points. 

Similarly, Osier, a First Team All-
CCAA selection, finished 7-of-14 
from the field and 12-of-16 at the 
free-throw line. Gaskin dished out 
10 points and five rebounds while 
Noonan contributed eight points, 
eight rebounds and a game-high 
six assists. 

As with the majority of their 
games this season, the Tritons 
locked in their victory by a margin 
of at least 10 points, defeating the 
Warriors 73-62. 

“In the flow of the game, I try to 
do what I can to help the team out,” 
Carlisle said. “[Friday night] it was 
the threes and the other night it was 
getting to the basket. We definitely 

have a talented team. Any night, 
anyone can come out and have 
an amazing game — everyone can 
score, so that’s a huge thing because 
with other teams, it’s just a few 
players but for us it’s everyone.”  

Not surprisingly, the Tritons 
possess the second best offense 
among CCAA teams, averaging 
68.6 points a game while their 
defense holds opponents to under 
60 points a night. 

“I’m very much a defense-mind-
ed coach,” Elliott said. “We try and 
disrupt our opponents — to get 
out and deny passes and pressure 
the basketball. We hope that our 
defense creates offense for us by 
getting steals, getting deflections, 
making tough shots and getting 
rebounds.” 

Making it to the halfway point, 
UCSD faces 10 more CCAA games 
in the challenge to make history by 
remaining undefeated. 

“We all felt that collectively, we 
had the ability and the talent to do 
this and to be where we are right 
now,” Elliott said. “Without the 
phenomenal leadership that we’ve 
been having by our captains, I don’t 
think we’d be where we are. Our 
leaders have done a phenomenal 
job of getting us ready to play every 
night, and that’s the tough thing 
about when you’re in conference 
play; you have to be ready every 
night.”

Next week, UCSD will face 
Sonoma State on Jan. 30 and 
Humboldt State on Jan. 31; the 
Tritons hope to stay undefeated. 

“Winning is definitely addic-
tive,” Martin said. “We’re such a 
competitive team within each other. 
We’re all going for the same goal 
and we all understand that, so that’s 
what we are working toward.”

MONDAY, JANUARY 26, 2009 THE UCSD GUARDIAN SPORTS  15

guys. I feel confident about our 
guys. We play 11 and 12 guys for 
a reason. One, because I have a lot 
of confidence in that group [off the 
bench], so we don’t fear a drop-off 
if we bring them in. Two, we need to 
have a bigger group to go to because 
of the back-to-backs and the rigor-
ous scheduling in this league.”

UCSD’s depth was on full dis-
play in the second half. While the 
starters took care of the scoring, 
quickly making up the double-
digit deficit, it took an entire team 
effort to hold Chico State scoreless 
through the first eight minutes of 
the second half. When the Wildcats 
finally did, they found themselves 
trailing the Tritons by two, 33-31. 
The two teams battled for the next 
several minutes before the Tritons 
opened up a 12 point advantage of 
their own with 3:21 to play. Poppen 
scored four points, senior guard 
Alan Husted added five and Kim 
scored six points, including a suc-
cessful four-point play and two 
assists during UCSD’s 15-6 run. But 
the Wildcats had one final run, as 
Bocian connected on the first of 
three Chico State three-pointers in 
the final three minutes that closed 
the gap to four points with 36 sec-
onds to play. The Tritons held on for 
the win, thanks to clutch free-throw 
shooting in the final seconds, fin-
ishing off an extraordinary second 
half which included a remarkable 
77.8 percent field goal shooting.

“At the end of the game, I want 
the ball in my hands,” Husted said. 

He knocked down two free 
throws with 31 seconds to play and 
finished 4-for-4 from the line on the 
night and 14-for-14 in free throws 
during the home stand. 

“I feel confident at the free-
throw line and my shot was feeling 
good tonight, so I just try to go 
there, knock down one at a time, 

and block everything else out,” 
Husted said.

As a team, UCSD went 26-of-33 
from the charity stripe, including 
21-of-27 in the second half. Kim 
led the team with a game-high 22 
points, a team-high five assists and 
three steals. Junior guard Jordan 
Lawley scored 13 points and Poppen 
added nine points and a game-high 
eight rebounds. The Triton defense 
was stellar, forcing 19 Chico State 
turnovers and holding Bocian to 
seven points on 3-of-11 shooting 
from the field.

The Tritons 
showed their com-
fort early on in a 
return home game 
against Cal State 
Stanislaus. While 
the Warriors 
scored the first 
four points of 
the game, UCSD 
calmly came 
back. Lawley hit 
a jumper, Poppen 
added a layup off 
a Husted assist 
and Husted con-
verted his own 
layup. The Tritons 
were able to 
extend that slight 
advantage throughout the rest of 
the first half, connecting on 52 
percent of their field-goal attempts 
while holding Cal State Stanislaus 
to 31.3 percent.

Equally impressive, the Tritons 
committed only two fouls in the first 
half and did not allow the Warriors 
to get to the charity stripe.

“If you look at their field-goal 
percentage, I think we did a pretty 
good job defensively,” Carlson said. 
“We did a pretty good job of staying 
in front of everybody and making 
them shoot contested shots.”

Leading by six with less than 

eight minutes remaining in the half, 
Lawley’s three-pointer signaled the 
start of an 11-2 UCSD run, giving 
the home team a 15 point advan-
tage. Cal State Stanislaus would 
score the only two baskets in the 
final four minutes before intermis-
sion, cutting the Triton lead to 10 at 
the break.

Again, the Warriors struck first in 
the second half, scoring five points, 
before back-to-back layups by soph-
omore guard Casey Ryan gave the 
Tritons a little breathing room. Cal 
State Stanislaus’ senior guard Benny 

Koochoie nailed a 
three-pointer that 
cut the deficit to 
38-34 with 14:48 
to play, but UCSD’s 
defense refused to 
break, holding the 
Warriors to only 
five points over the 
next seven min-
utes and reopen-
ing its double-digit 
lead. The Tritons 
led by no less than 
nine points and by 
as much as 13 as 
Husted went 6-for-
6 and Lawley went 
3-for-4 from the 
free-throw line in 

the closing minutes.
“It was a lot of back and forth, 

but we just made sure we hit our 
free throws and got a couple key 
stops,” Poppen said.

The Tritons played good team 
offense, not settling for contested 
shots against the Warriors.

“We moved the ball pretty well, 
looked for the open guy,” Acevedo 
said. “Coach kept preaching to slow 
down, make them play our tempo.”

Lawley finished with a game-
high 19 points and added four 
rebounds, while Husted scored 15 
points, going a perfect 10-for-10 

from the line. Kim scored eight 
points, a game-high six assists 
and four rebounds; Poppen added 
six points, six rebounds and two 
assists; and Acevedo scored six with 
three rebounds in 13 minutes off 
the bench. As a team, UCSD shot 
47.8 percent from the field, 85 per-
cent from the line, and grabbed 38 
rebounds, compared to 33 boards 
for Cal State Stanislaus.

“It was a great win for us, we 
definitely needed it,” Husted said. 
“It wasn’t our best offensive perfor-
mance, but we played a really good 
offensive team and we held them to 
a low percentage. Defense wins ball 
games.”

Despite the win, the Tritons still 
recognized the need for improve-
ment and remained focused not on 
past success, but on what they still 
need to do.

“We could have done a lot bet-
ter job on the boards, even though 
we outrebounded them,” Carlson 
said. “Seventeen offensive rebounds 
[allowed] is not very good — we 
need to do a lot better job there. 
The moment you think you’ve 
turned the corner or you’ve done 
something well, this league has a 
way of smacking you and putting 
you back in your place. We haven’t 
accomplished any of the goals we 
really set out to do, and so it’s just 
an ongoing process of us trying to 
get a little bit better.”

UCSD will look to continue its 
conference momentum during its 
next four games on the road. The 
Tritons will face Sonoma State on 
Jan. 30 and Humboldt State on Jan. 
31 before traveling closer to home 
for games at Cal State Dominguez 
Hills and Cal State Los Angeles on 
Feb. 6 and Feb. 7. All games are 
slated for tip-off at 7:30 p.m.

at jtevelow@ucsd.edu.

Unfortunately, the Triton men’s 
meet did not turn out as well. 

“We were definitely expecting 
more from the guys team,” head 
coach Scott McGihon said. “Some 
guys swam really well and others 
didn’t. That’s about as simple as I 
can put it.”

First-place finishes were hard to 
come by  against one of the nation’s 
best programs at UC Irvine. Senior 
Knief Lohse took second place in 
the 200 yard freestyle, behind UC 
Irvine, with a time of 1:44.22, while 
senior captain Steve Hardy finished 
second in the 100 yard freestyle with 
a time of 24.02. Junior Pablo Carrillo 
also recorded a second-place finish 
in the 100 yard breaststroke with a 
time of 57.71. 

It recorded a second place finish 
in the 200 yard freestyle relay with a 
time of 1:24.10 led by freshman Sam 
Stromberg, junior Todd Langland, 
freshman Blake Langland and senior 
captain Daniel Perdew.

The Tritons have little time to 
recuperate as they prepare for their 
final meet next week before the con-
ference championships. The Triton 
women will face the San Diego 
State Aztecs and the University 
of Wyoming Cowboys, while the 
men’s team will be up against the 
University of Wyoming in a meet at 
San Diego State.

“We’re really going to analyze 
what happened at this meet and pre-
pare for next weekend,” McGihon 
said. “We really need to get in some 
preparation for conference champi-
onships.”

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — En route to 
making history, the 21st ranked women’s 
basketball team kept its winning streak intact 
over the weekend, claiming victories over 
Cal State Stanislaus on Jan. 23 and Chico 
State on Jan. 24. With the dual wins, head 
coach Charity Elliott’s squad boosts its over-
all record to 17-2 while remaining atop the 
California Collegiate Athletic Association 
with an undefeated 10-0 mark.  

Against Chico State, the Tritons put 
together an early lead with a 10-0 run five 
minutes into the period. A layup by junior 
guard Leilani Martin followed by steals from 
junior forward Erin Noonan and junior 
guard Annette Ilg garnered some rhythm for 
the Tritons. 

However, the Wildcats promptly answered 
with six points, cutting the lead to four. 
With 2:30 remaining in the first, Chico State 
tied the game at 19. But, a foul by junior 

forward Christine Vest allowed freshman 
guard Chelsea Carlisle to convert on her free 
throws, putting UCSD up by two. Despite 
a limited Triton offense shooting at just 28 
percent, UCSD was able to eek out a delicate 
24-19 lead entering halftime. 

Like previous games this season, UCSD 
heightened its offensive power immediately 
in the second half, going on a 14-6 run to 
secure a lead of 38-25. With just over three 
minutes to play, the Wildcats wobbled and 
the Tritons put the game away at 62-38. The 
Wildcats’ 38 points were the fewest scored by 
any Triton opponent this season. 

“Our offense was terrible the first half, so 
we really cranked it up on the offensive end,” 
Martin said. “If our shots weren’t falling, we 
were at least getting rebounds and put backs 
in. We ran the floor a lot more than in the 
first half and that created more open and 
easier shots.” 

Senior center Alexis Gaskin scored 14 of 
her points in the critical second half, ulti-
mately leading the Triton scorers with 21 
points, finishing just shy of her season-high 
22. Carlisle reached double digits for a fourth 
straight game, tallying 14 points, three assists  
and three steals, while Ilg and Martin added

MEN’S BASKETBALL — The Tritons 
extended their winning streak to four as 
they returned home this weekend, defeating 
California Collegiate Athletic Association foes 
Cal State Stanislaus and Chico State in front of 
raucous RIMAC Arena crowds on Jan. 23 and 
Jan. 24. The Tritons led nearly the entire game 
in a 67-58 win against Cal State Stanislaus on 
Friday before putting together a big second-
half comeback in a 69-63 win over Chico State 
on Saturday. Now at the midpoint of its CCAA 
schedule, UCSD’s record stands at 10-6 overall 
and 7-3 in conference play.

The Tritons were prepared for a battle on 
Saturday night, as the CCAA’s top-ranked 
defense welcomed in Chico State and the 
conference’s top scorer, 6-foot-6-inch senior 
forward Andy Bocian. However, head coach 
Chris Carlson’s squad did not shy away from 
the challenge before the game.

“Bocian is the leading scorer in the league, 

so a lot of what we’re going to do is depen-
dent upon stopping him first,” senior forward 
Shane Poppen said. “Stopping him is just 
getting him uncomfortable. So, if he’s used 
to getting the ball on the block, double him. 
Just send different stuff at him. Harass him 
all night.”

Bocian’s 20.9 points per game on the sea-
son is four points better than the next highest 
scorer in the conference.

“It looks like we might have a tough time 
with [Bocian], but we have some tricks up 
our sleeves,” junior guard Tyler Acevedo said 
before the matchup.

While UCSD held Bocian scoreless through 
the first 10.5 minutes of Saturday’s game, the 
rest of the Wildcats’ offense was far more 
successful, leading by as much as 11 points. 
Senior guard Kelvin Kim brought the Tritons 
to within two with seven of nine UCSD points, 
before back-to-back jumpers by Bocian ignit-
ed a 12-2 Chico State run. The Wildcats held 
UCSD to only four points through the final 
nine minutes of the half and held an 11 point 
margin, 29-18, at the break.

“The thing about this league is we play 
back-to-backs,” Carlson said. “It puts a pre-
mium on staying fresh and playing a lot of

SWIMMING & DIVING — With 
only two weeks left before con-
ference championships, the Tritons 
knew they would have to put up 
one of their best performances last 
weekend to prepare for the season’s 
biggest event. Facing off against the 
Cal Baptist University Lancers and 
the UC Irvine Anteaters on Jan. 24, 
the Tritons showcased some of their 
best swimmers and times to get 
themselves ready for conference.

The Triton women beat host 
UC Irvine 176-124 and crushed 
Cal Baptist University 209-82. The 
Triton men, on the other hand, took 
two losses, falling to UC Irvine 185-

96 and to Cal Baptist University 
165-118. 

The Tritons started out strong, 
placing first in the 200 yard med-
ley relay with a time of 1:49.30 led 
by freshman Shea Kopp, freshman 
Sadie O’Brien, sophomore Jessica 
Ferguson and senior captain Aubrey 
Panis.

“We did really well,” Panis said. 
“It was the first time we had ever 
beaten UC Irvine, so we were really 
excited about that.”

Sophomore Anju Shimura led 
the way in events for Tritons, plac-
ing first in the 100 yard backstroke 
with a time of 58.13 and following 
that up with another first-place fin-
ish in the 200 yard backstroke with 
a time of 2:04.90. Kendall Bohn also 

took away victories in the 100 and 
200 yard breaststroke with times 
of 1:06.24 and 2:22.13, respectively. 
Panis, Kopp and Ferguson worked 
to sweep the top three spots of the 
50 yard freestyle at the meet.

As usual, the Triton women fin-
ished with a blowout in the final 
race of the meet: the 200 yard free-
style relay. Led by Shimura, sopho-
more Ashtyn Douglass, senior Erin 
Deters and Panis, UCSD took the 
final event with a time of 1:37.20.

“Our girls swam really well,” 
Panis said. “We knew we could beat 
Cal Baptist but Irvine we weren’t 
sure. We just have some really good 
swimmers.”ERIK JEPSEN/GUARDIAN FILE
