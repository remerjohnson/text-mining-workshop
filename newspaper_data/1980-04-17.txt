"I feel like I'm a prisoner in this 
country," commented one UCSD 
Iranian student. "I was going 
back to Iran this summer. Now I

WanflC:S relill'n;'· ~ salel. . 

All the Iranian students 
interviewed asked not to be 
identified. Carter's new foreign 
policy with respect to Iran leaves 
Iranian students with mixed 
reaction . Many expressed 
contempt for the US government 
though carefully making a 
distinction between the American 
government and American 
people. 

Expressing "love" for 
Americans, one student said he 
didn't blame those Americans 
who . demonstrate anti-Irimian 
attitudes. 1bey are innocent 
victims of the media, he said. 

"You can't blame American 
people who watch five or six 
hour. of TV a day for their 
mentality. The media alters basic 
reality in such a manner that 
people conceive it to be reality," 
he explained. 

Iraman students say they' ve 
indirectly been confronted with 

anti ~ lranian reactions on 
campus, through the graffitti in 
the bathrooms and on the tables 
in the libraries. Since Carter's 
announcement last week, they 
claim, the graffiti is increasing 
every day . 

Calling the bathroom 
confrontations "shameful", one 
USIU Iranian student who 
studies on campus said the people 
who write these things don't 
understand the Iranian situation 
and don't want to. 

They ' ve been verbally 
confronted several times off 
campus while eating in 
restaurants or on the beach, the 
students continued. 

"We rarely go out alone off 
campuI," aaid on,e atudent 
explaining he felt threatened. 
"We have to stick together to 
protect ourselves," he said. 

While a few Iranian studenta 
find it difficult to concentrate on 
their studies, most of them said 
they were able to continue their 
work in spite of the situation. 

Some students expressed 
fruatration at being caught in the 
middle of the Iranian and 
American governments. 
. "I am the victim of two 

governmenta trying to get even 
with each other ," he said adding, 
"I wiah I could release the 
hostages, but I have no power." 

Other students view the 
"crisis" as part of the Iranian 
revolution. "This affects me," 
one student said, "but I have to 
give up something for the 
revolution."

AS Wrangles 
On Appointments 
For Second Week 

BY JEFF BERESFORD-HOWE 
Ne_ Editor 

The AS Council flailed through two personnel 
decisions for almost two hourslasl night, over.ruIing 
one appointment it made last week and up~olding 
another. 

The Council took back its Student Center Board 
appointment of Robb Strom after several 
representatives attacked AS President Carlos 
Montalvo and the council's own deliberative process. 

But the Council stuck to its guns and refused to 
seat Muir Representative Fred Nagel. 

Montalvo over-ruled a decision by Appointments 
and Evaluations commissioner Brad Barham to 
appoint Art Schlaroff to the Board, appointing 
instead Strom. 

In a secret ballot at the Council meeting last week, 
the Council upheld Montalvo. 

This week, though, Barham said Montalvo ''had 
caused problems aU year" by exercising his executive 
authority inudiciously, and Jon Bekken said the 
council should be "ashamed" of its decision to hold a 
secret ballot. 

"The ballot last week was totallr illegitimate," 
Bekken said. "The issue last night,' he said, "was 
whether we want to let the students know how we

Saxon Letter 
Still at Issue 
UC President, Regents' 
Salaries Now Involved 

BY CAROLYN FRIDAY 
Sacramento Con-elpOlldent 

The university's Board of Regents and UC 
President David Saxon are under attack again in 
legislative hearings this week. 

State assembly members are considering motions 
to cut 30 percent of the state support for the Regents 
office, and reduce the university's general budget by 
$30,000 to offset the cost incurred by Saxon's letter 
on tuition . 

In addition, Assemblyman Gene Chappie, R· 
Roseville, produced a legislative counsel's opinion 
saying it's illegal for a UC official to use state monies 
to advocate support of or opposition to a ballot 
measure. 

The opinion did not say that's what Saxon had 
done when he sent out a letter to UC students last 
month outlining what the impact of Jarvis II could be 
on the _ - :"ersity, but Chappie said it was. 

The budget·cutting motions were put before the 
Assembly Ways and Means Subcommittee

nomination at the A.S. 
meeting, ;8 "1UI'prise" letter 
from Montalvo was 
IUbmitteci, in his absence, to 
the council. Apparently, 
Montalvo had changed his 
mind shortly after the 
committee deciaion had been 
reached, chooaing, a is his 
perotative, to iJnore the ' 
recommendationa of the 
A&E committee, and 
nominate the committee's

This action, however 
legitimate technically, was 
unprecedented, unethical 
and blatantly wiaateral. 

The end result of much 
bureaucratic juggling W81 
that, after two tied votes, the 
V.P., Nancy Laga broke the 
tie voting for Strom. Special 
attention should be given to 
the use ,of secret ballots 
despite Barham's inaistence 
on a role call vote. It is 
deplorable that elected 

representatives would 
choose not to make their vote 
a matter of public record. 

Another pertinent issue is 
that Strom, being an A.S. rep 
from Muir, is a voting 
member of the council, and 
failed to have the moral 
fortitude to publically abstain 
from voting on an action 
which entail. such an 
obviOUI conflict of interests. 
His argument that he W81 
representing his constituancy 
is ei.tifuHy w~. 
. The problem lies primarily 
m a system which legitimizes 
such things as absolution of 
power, secret ballots, and 
conflict of interest, and 
secondly with the individual, 
who use this system to their 
personal advantage.

Editor: 

In light of the fact that the

10 crucial to the operation of 
the ASUCSD Council, I am 
concerned that students 
should have the opportunity

my fellow candidates before 
they vote. A traditional 
problem with campus 
elections is that the students 

do not kmW the candidates

are justifiably discouraged 
from voting. A, a member of 
the AS and 81 a candidate, I 
feel that this must change. A

Hostages': Football in 
Iranian Power Game 
Khomeini Didn't Order Transfer So 
Unity of Revolution Would Last 

BY WILLIAM BEEMAN 
The latest failure to win the tranfer of the American 

hostqea in Tehran ~ .I0ve;rnment care has ~n interpreted 
by the Carter Administration and the American public as 
another slap in the face by Ayatollah Khomeini. The 
Administration's response has been to slap back with 
relatively ineffective sanctions and rhetorical threats actions 
which seem certain to further strengthen the militants~ resolve 
and to further isolate the likes of President Bani·Sadr and the 
moderates . 

William Beeman i. a contributing editor of Pacific News 
Service. , 

But this unfortunate worsening of the crisis steml from a 
basic misreading of what really happened when Khomeini 
w~ asked . to resolve the hostage impalle. The 
nullnterpretabon of events results from precisely the kind of 
cultural and political myopia which has time and again 
JRvented the United States from making any progress on the 
hostage issue over nearly five months. 

To view the recent aituation in the Iranian context is to see 
that Khomeini did not act a he did to defy the United States, 
but rather to preserve the still fragile, developing political 
structure of the revolutionary government. He acted 81 he 
had to act to preserve his own authority, the authority of the 
govermnent, and the aedibility of the revolution. While such 
concerns may seem almost inconsequential to many 
Americana in comparison to the concern of the hostages' 
safety and welfare, they are nonetheless the supreme . 
priorities of the Ayatollah. 

The question of who shall have authority over the hostages 
- the rnaitant students or the presumably more responsible 

gover~~t offi,cials - hu .become ~ ~entral and extremely 
troublllllf IlIUe 1ft the evolution of polibcal power in Tehran. 
. The question i. enmeshed in the kind 01 power squeeze that 
II the bread and butter 01 petty politics. Two factions, both 
with coo~iderabl~ ~t uncertain authority, are _king to 
auert their superlonty over one another. President Bani·Sadr 
mUit ~mehow stand up to the clerics on the Revolutionary 
Counal and prove to those who elected him that hi, authority 
is .upreme. Likewise, the Council clerics, who conaider 
themselves the chief legitimizing force in Iran's Islamic 
Republic, and whQ are openly hostile to Bani.Sadr, Inust 
~ve to the people that the President-is subordinate to them. 
The unfortunate football in this power struggle is the 
hostages. 

Bani·Sadr would like to force the Council to accept 
responsibility for the hostages, thus proving his power over 
them. The clerics realize that to accede to the President would 
be to relegate their own power to a secondary role . 
Futhermore, if they had acceded and then the militant 
students had resisted the transfer, their impotence would have 
been total. 

Given thia impasse, both parties resorted to the Ayatollah 
Khomeini to settle their quarrel. To Americans, it appeared 
that Khomeini W81 being asked to rule on the issue of the 
hostages. But what he in fact was asked to do was to decide 
who had the superior authority, Bani·Sadr or the derics of the 
Revolutionary Council. The football was clearly in 
Khomeini's lap, but it w8ln't the same football that 
Americana perceived. . 

Khomeini, whose power as the AyatoUah aJ.'Ozma (the 
~~t AyatoUah) is dependent on the conaenaus of all those 
reIJllOUI leaders beneath him, is naturally disposed to seek 
unanimity in all decisions, and to avoid any conflict which 
might erode hi, own authority and that of the Islamic 
Republic. . 

I~ fac~, he ~ exercised very little power since the 
pr~ldentiai elections, preferring to ait back and let events take 
t~ natural course. He knows that much of his influence 
derives from the fact that on the rare occasions when he must 
make a decision, the people have faith that he will opt for the 
course that has the beat chance of preserving unity. 

In thia instance, he W81 aked to choose between the two 
principal. factions of political power. Apparently he was asked 
several times , and each time he remained silent. f"mally tIw! 
Revolutionary Council itself took a vote 00 whether to a~ept 
respons.i~1ity for the hostages: When they came back to KJ.1omeiru he 81ked whether their vote W81 unanimous. They 
IBId no. He laid that without unanimity, the transfer could not 
be _I!pproved. 

Khomeini thus averted what could have been two 
dqer~. developme~ta: ~ the one hand he prevented an 
open split m ~ Council, which.would have impaired his own 
authority, and on the other he side-.tepped the poaibility of a 
violent confrontalion between resilting militanta and 
lovemment forces, an event that couIcI have discredited the 
entire revolution. 

So the power balance will be maintained for now until a 
new political force - the newly elected Parliament"":' comes 
alan, to tilt it one way or another. Khorneini can then let 
nature take ill course, a is his inclination. In the meantime ' 
he can use the c:ontinui.,. host .. criU to move the I~ 
Republic one .... further tow.d a NCUre future with the 
establishment of the new Parliament.

No Locallmiriunity in 
Civil Rights Suits 

WASHINGTON - The 
Supreme Court, by a 5·4 vote, 
ruled ,yesterday that the 
nation's cities and counties 
enjoy no legal immunity when 
they violate someone's federal 
civil rights. 

Completing a dramatic , 
two year turnaround from its 
rulings that until 1978 gave 
cities and counties absolute 
immunity from such lawsuits , 
the court stripped away legal 
protection for even those 
official acts carried out in 
"good faith." 

The justices said cities and 
c ounties, unlike their 
employees, never are entitled 
to a qualified, "good faith" 
immunity from a lawsuit 
charging that individual rights 
protected by the Constitution 
or federal law were violated. 

The court's dissenters said 
the decision " converts 
municipal governance into a 
hazardous slalom through 
constitutional obstades that 
often are known and 
unknowable." 

Most states give their 
political subdivisions at least a 
qualified immunity from 
lawsuits based on state law 
violations. But that immuruty 
no longer exists for lawsuits 
based on constitutional or 
federal law violations. ' 

The court :s majority 
opinion, written by Justice 
WiUiam J. Brennan Jr., was 
based on his interpretation of 

an 1871 civil rights law and 
"by considerations of public 
policy. " 

"The knowledge that a 
municipality will be liable for 
all of its injurious conduct, 
whether committed in good 
faith or not , should create an 
incentive for officials who may 
harbor doubts about the 
lawfulness of their intended 
actions to err on side of 
protecting citizens' constitu· 
tional rights," Brennan said. 

Past Supreme Court rulings 
have established such a "good 
faith" immunity for public 
officials.

Palestine Talks 
To Go Non-Stop 

WASHINGTON - Presi· 
dent Carter many order further 
retaliatory moves a gainst 
Iran as early as today but will 
not consider military action to 
~ree America.ns held hostage 
In Tehr~ unhl after mid.May, 
a lop aide said yesterday. 

The aide, who declined to 
be quoted by name, indicated 
that a Carter announcement of 
new economic and diplomatic 
sanctions would come 500n -
perhaps in time for a nationally 
broadcasl news conference 
tentatively scheduled for 
today. 

The source also said the US 
government has told its allies 
that Iran should have ample 
time by mid· May to respond 
to the sanctions Carter ordered 
last week, which involved the 
severing of diplomatic 
relations with the Tehran 
regime. 

Carter Steps Not 
Violent Just Yet 

WASHINGTON - Presi· 
dent Carter's back·to·back 
summit talk. with Egyptian 
President Anwar Sadat and 

Israeli Prime Minister 
Menachem 8ejin resulted in 
an agreement 'yesterday to 
hold non· stop negotiations in 
the Middle East on the future 
of 1.2 million Palestinians. 

The intensive negotiations 
are aimed at translating 
Begin's 1979 promise of 
autonomy for Arabs 6ving 
under Israeli's control into a 
council elected by inhabitants 
of the West Bank of the 
Jordan River and the Gaza 
district. 

At a news conference, 
Begin said he could not predict 
an agreement by May 26, the 
date set as a goal by Egypt and 
Israel. But he said the 
marathon negotiations could 
be extended, noting that the 
two countries took sit months 
instead of the three planned to 
wrap up their peace treaty Iut 
year. 

To Japan: 'Dump 
Rice Elsewhere' 

WASHINGTON - Agri. 
culture Secretary Bob 
Berlliand said yesterday it 
would be better if Japan 
donated surplus rice to needy 
people in other countries than 
pursued its current policy of 
dumping ' the grain on the 
world market. 

Bergland said Japan ' s 
surplus rice stockpile of about 
6 miUion metric , tons poses a

threat to US producers who 
depend heavily on sales 
overseas. 

"It would be awful for 
everybody, including the

Simply dump that 6 mil ion 
tons on the market and break 
everything down," he said.

Saxon, UC Budget Both Targets 
Money for Anti-9 Letter, Maybe Much More, Proposed as Budget Cuts 

Continued from pate 1 
tee Monday by Assemblyman 
William Leonard, R-San 
Bernardino, in the courae of 
the review of the W1iversity'. 
1980-81 budtet. 

Since neither motion ' 
received the necessary three 
votel of approval, they are.tiD 
JJeDCinI the appoinbnent of a 
fifth, democratic member to 
the committee to replace 
Aasnblyman John Vucon-
cdIoa, D-San Joae, who left to 
become chairman of the fuU 
W~. and Means Committee. 

To rectiij what Leonard 
Mel _ exorbitant •• arieI paid 
to the three r ..... officer. 01 
the Regenll, he propoIeCI 
..... $452,000 of the 
... ~ from the Retenll 
IreMww s office, aayinf that 
.. MIe corpor ..... take 
their ............ t coeta from 

the proceeds of the investment 
portfolio. they handle. 

Leonard also moved to 
eliminate $30,000 from the 
university'l Itate support. 

"Thi. letter is a public 
expenditure of campaign 
lunda which I regard as 
outrageous," said Leonard 
about the controverlial letter 
Saxon sent to 130,000 UC 
atudenll, alerting them of the 
possibility of the impolition of 
tuition if Prop. 9 PUles JW1e 
3. 

"In addition, the figures in 
the letter are not in agreement 
with what I have seen on this 
tuition matter," said Leonard. 

He cited a 1978 court of 
appeala cue, Miler v •. MiJIer, 
in which a private citizen from 
IU district sued California 
Commiuion on the Status for 
Women for uaint ill influence 

to campaign for the passage of 
the ERA amendment. 

That court ruled that the 
category of campaign material 
was decided not by the 
objective of the material, but 
by the audience to whom it is 
directed, Leonard said. 

Both Leonard and 
Aaaemblyman Jim fJlis, R-
San Diego, said if the 
committee could take line-item 
action on the univerlity'l 
budget, they would recom-
mend docking Saxon'. aa1ill}' 
by $30,000. The UC 
president earns $78,750 per 
year, and is the highest paid 
employee of the Itate. 

UC Vice Presidenta Tom 
Jenkins and Donald Swain 
aslured the committee that 
Saxon did not regard the letter 
as a political document in any 

way and had carefully 
couched his worda to indicate 
the $600 to $800 tuition levels 
were far from being 
certainties . 

"From what I have see, the 
atudenta have taken a much 
more responsible action in 
responding to the heat buildins 
up in California over this 
matter," Leonard rejoined. 

Leonard then quoted from 
SBPC representative Linda 
Sabo'. testimony at the March 
Regenta meeting, when she 
said, "To tear down a 112 
year old tradition of tuition-
free higher education would be 
grollly irresponsible unleu all 
other optionl for filling the 
revenu·e gapl created by 
financial Ihortfalll are 
thoroughly examined, tested 
and rejected." 

Aaaemblyman Gary Hart, 
D-Santa Barbara, who felt the 
letter was a realistic 
assessment of what could 
happen ii Prop. 9 passes, 
questioned the university's 
rationale for the tuition figures 
cited in the letter, which differ 
from those determined in the 
California Postsecondary 
Education Commission 
(CPEC) report, Price of 
Admissions. 

Jenkins responded that the 
CPEC report was based on 
scanty data. "We ask

Faculty Salaries Up 5.3 Percent 
The first major survey of 

1979-80 academic salaries 
indicates that this year's 
average faculty pay is 5.3 
percent higher than in 1978-
79. The Chronicle of Higher 
Education reported this week. 

The 1979-80 study, by the 
Office of Institutional 
Research at Oklahoma State 
University, includes data for 
faculty members on nine-
month contracts at 68 public 
universities . 

Results of the study mav 

differ from naltonal figures 
that will become available 
later in the year. Comprehen-
sive salary data are gathered 
annually from virtually every 
college and university in the 
country by the National 
Center for Education Statistics 
and the American Association 
of University Professors . 

The NCSD-AAUP figures 
for 1978·79 showed an 
increase of 6 percent for 
faculty members at public 
universities and 6 percent for

faculty members at all types of 
colleges and universities. 

The 5.3 percent increase for 
this year in the Oklahoma 
State survey matches in 
increase shown by national 
figures for 1977·78, a year in 
which the cost of living was 
rising only about half as fast as 
it it this year. 

During calendar 1979, the 
Labor Department's index of 
consumer prices rose 1.4 
percent. I n the first two months 
of 1980, the index rose at an 

annual rate of 18 percent. 
A faculty-salary study 

reported at this year's meeting 
of the American Association 
for Hig_her Education 
indicated that the average 
faculty member suffered a 13 
percent loss of purchasing 
power between 1972-73 and 
1978-79. 

During t~ ,t s.ix-year period, 
average faoulty salaries rose 
38 percent and the index of 
consumer prices rose 60 
percent. 

The Oklahoma State study 
shows substantial regional 
differences in this year's 
faculty-salary increases. 

The highest regional 
average - and the Iowellt 
percentage increase - is in 
the survey's Re gion 3 
(generally the Northeast), 
where the average a1ary for 
faculty members of all ranks is 
up 4.7 percent to $24,291.

The collaborative effort 

brought together the different

managed to define and purify 
the reaction center as well as 
examine ita structure by 
vanous spectroscopic means. 
By examining an isolated 
protein in this way, however, 
ita function inside of a 
biological membrane cannot 
be fully determined. 

Montal's general methods 
in the reconstitution of proteins 
in lipid (a "greasy" growth 
medium) bilayers made 
possible the incorporation of 
reaction centers into artificial 
membranes. An artificial

unmeasureable currents and

with reaction center proteins in 
it. The measurement of such 
currents and voltages may 
eventually lead to a better 
understanding of the precise 
mechanism involved in the 
stimulation of the reaction 
center by photons. 

In an age when energy is 
becoming more and more 
scarce, insight into nature's 
energy processes may 
eventually provide scientists 
with the means to produce 
cheap and abundant sources 
of energy. 

Schonfeld warned, how. 
ever, that one should not 
become overly optimistic 
because the gap between 
research being done in 
reaction center proteins and 
possible applications to the 
energy crisis is still very large. 

"Our research may 
eventually be the first step in 
constructing artificial devices 
that operate on a similar 
principle as the reaction center 
proteins; however, such a 
prospect is to be found in the 
very distant, not immediate, 
future," he says.

Acid Imbalance Corrected, Child Saved 
Amino Acid Imported from Japan to Correct 20 Month Old Matthew's Metabolic Disease 

It was seven months ago 
when the sickly, 13 month old, 
eight pound boy was brought 
dying to University Hospital, 
but the youngster has survived 
the odd. and beaten a genetic 
disease which almost always 
kills or severely retards its 
victims. 

Although Matthew's 
intellectual development has 
just begun to improve, his 
physical recovery has been 
nothing short of remarkable. 

When Matthew was only 
one month old, doctors 
discovered that he suffered 
from methylmalonic acidemia, 
a disease which disrupts the 
delicate balance between acid 
and base in the human system. 

The disorder centers around 
the conversion of normal 
proteins and fats foWKI in all 
foods into a toxic side-product, 
methylmalonic acid. Thus,

Matthew's body got no protein 
but accumulated an overload 
of acid. 

As a result, Matthew often 
had severe rashes, suffered 
from dehydration and 
occasionally slipped into a 
coma, near death. 

At this point, a little more 
than a year ago, Matthew was 
referred to Drs . William 
Nyhan and Drew Kelts at 
University Hospital. Nyhan 
had treated a similar case 
eleven years ago, and it was 
thought that his experience 
was the only hope Matthew 
had . 

Because of Matthew's 
unique case, Nyhan had to 
fonnulate an entirely new 
approach to treating the 
disease. In lOme methylmalo-
rue children, vitamin B12 
treatments help counter the 
devastating effects of the 

disease, but for some reason, 
Matthew'li B 12 level was near 
normal. 

Nyhan's solution to the 
problem was to measure the 
intake of the enzyme 
responsible for Matthew's acid 
imbalance, methylmalonyl-
CoA-isomerase. 

The treatment Nyhan used 
is perhaps as difficult as the 
name of the enzyme with 
which he was working. Nyhan 
and his associates had to 
intravenously feed Matthew 
chemically synthesized 
solutions, a task which 
involved many people up and 
down the West coast, and 
across the ocean in the Far 
East. 

The necessary amino acid 
was synthesized in Japan, 
shipped to UCLA for further 
processing and then sent to 
University: Hospital dieticians 

C 19110 MOCTEZUMA IMPORTS, INC.. IRVINE. CA 

for final preparation. 
Samples of Matthew's 

blood and urine are now taken 
routinely in order to monitor 
the level of the amino acid in 
his system. This way, the 
doctors know just how much 
protein he can handle and 
adjust his diet immediately to 
keep the acid-bale balance. 

Also, Matthew is now 
undergoing physical therapy, 
speech training, and interuive 
nursing care in an attempt to 
accelerate his physical and 

mental 1P'0wth. Judging from 
the only similar case Nyhan 
has handled, Matthew has a 
chance of eventuaUy attaining 
a normal growth pattern. 

"Since many metabolic 
diseases stem from a missing 
or inactlve enzyme, a 
variation of Matthew's diet 
may work for other children 
with metabolic defects," Kelts 
explains. 

Matthew is expected to 
return to his parents and three· 
month old sister by mid.May.

Fine Line Twixt Excellence, 
Excess Danced by 'Nijinsky' 

Nijinaky, Vaalav Fomich, b, Kiev 1889, d, 
London 1950, Diagnosill: dementia praecox_ 
Lunacy. 

"I am a clown of God .. ,Nijinlky of God." 
lhese are the lalit, pathetic words mouthed by 
the strait·jacketed former .tar of the famous 
BaUets Ruuea in Herbert RoIlS'S new film 
Nijin,kll, (Roll i. to be held accountable as 
the person who brought you The Turning 
Point.) 

Bated on the memoin of the dancer's wife, 
Nijin.kll is a tender account of a brilliant, yet 
weak·wiIled performer - an avant-garde 
artiat whose extraordinary technique and 
unusual aeative talent found him at the 
pinnacle of success, balancing there on a 
shaky fulcn.n between eccentricity and 
outriiltt madnell. 

Unlike The Turni", Point, Nijinskllderives 
its power from the Itrength. of the narrative, 
not from interpolated segments 01 unrelated 
dance footage. 1be ballet we do see is 
easential to the discharge of the tale - the 
great Nijinaky would never have achieved 
notoriety, for example, if he had failed to 
create and dance the overtly erotic and 
paganiltic "Afternoon of a Faun," a ballet 

whose lIimmering ritualistic sexuality was a 
lIummary outgrowth of the artist's brilliance 
and repreased insanity, (The film also treats 
balletomanes with excerpts from ""The Rite of 
Spring," "The Spectre of the Rose," 
"Petrouchka" and "Games ,") 

Ironically, Nijinsky's agressive stage 
eroticism W81 matched by a real-life sexual 
passivity, Called a "filthy pederast's whore," 
he lpent the early part of hi. career living with 
Sergei Diaghilev, the famous impresario for 
the Ballets Russes . 

Until he was seduced by Romola de 
Pulllcky (later to be his wife) Nijinsky's sole 
sexual liaison was with the older man who 
plucked him from the Polish peasantry to 
make him a ballet genius. 

From the first, Valla v Nijinsky was indeed 
a down - a marionette with no clear sexual 
preference who behaved according to the 
tastes of the person, man or woman, 
manipulating him. Director Roll deals with 
this passive ambivalence adroitly, The touch 
is so delicate one wonders about the etiology 
of the heavy-handed emotional edema in The

AS Argues Two Appointments Cont.,.. from tHJIe 1 
make our dec:itionI, when we make our deciaiona and 
what dec:iaiont we're makint." 

By a 12-5 margin, the Council agreed and 
reeeated Strom and confinned Schlarolf. 

But Bill T oPto., while acknowledging that it wu 
"rude" of the Muir Council not to conduct interview., 
said the AS would be "hitting ila head against the 
wall" by not honoring the appointment. 

Linda Sabo, who i. running for AS office with 
T opki., said Nagel', appointment should be 
approved "in the interest of AS-c~ge relation.," 
and Muir Council chair Rosemary Graborek argued 
that since the appointment was temporary, it wu 
better to get a representative as lOOn as poaaible, 
even if that meant not conducting interviews. 

In other business last night, the AS: 
- agreed to ~~n.or a Proposition 9 

"informational" rally. While resolution sponser Brad 
Barham said the raDy would be non·partisan, the 
featured speaker will be Roland Vincent, the rnan 
who headed the Proposition 13 campaign two years 
ago but is now one of the leaders of the anti·9 
movement. 

'The Council atood ita around, however, on ita 
clecilion Iut week to refuse to leat Nagel. 

Pam Gerber, one of the five applicanta not 
iraniewed by the Muir Council before it appointed NaaeI, wu near tear, a, she told the AS Council that 
abe wu "thorouIhIy and completely insulted ... 

"I wu deeply &..it by not being interviewed. If you 
accept (Nagel', appoinbnent), you are defeating the 

~ of every biD (ur~ democratic deai.i 
making) that you've pused.' Gerber said. 

The Council voted twice to defeat the 
appointment, fir.t by a five to five vote with five 
abstention., then by a five to eight vote with one 
abstention. 

- approved an allocation of $650 to underwrite 
the cost of costumes for the Ballet F oIkerico. Such 
funding violates AS bylaws, but T opkis, who is 
Activity Fee chairman, said the AS would retain 
custody of the costumes and would probably get its 
money back. The Third College Council is alsa 
funding part of the Ballet's costume cOlitS. 

F acuIty Salaries 
Continued from tHJIe 5 
average salary IS up 7.4 
percent to$23,174.lnRegion 
2 (mostly Midwe.t), the 
average i. up 6.7 percent to 
$22,492. In Region 4 
(Southeut), the average is up 
6.4 percent to $22,905. 

For IuD profesaon in the 
Oklahoma State survey, the 
average salary has risen 4.7

A dedine in faculty salaries

power but in number of doDars 
- i. reported by the 
0Idah0ma State .tudy in some 
academic diaciplinea;-.uch u 
computer anel information 

.cience and some of the health 
profes.ions. 

Data for a single academic 
rank within a specific discipline 
in the Oklahoma State study 

are based on a relatively small 
number of individuals. Hence, 
they are less reliable for 

makin~ comparison 

Nijinsky 
Continued from PORe 10 

George de la Pena stars with Leslie Browne 
in Nijinsky. Both-have performed with the 
American BaDet Theatre, yet Browne, who 
plays Romola, does not dance in the film. This 
is unfortunate because she is a much better 
dancer than actress. (ABTs Carla Fraccis 
plays Nijinsky's partner, Tamara'Karsavina.) 
As Nijinsky, de la Pena is superb. The 23 year 
old New Yorker captures all the nuances of 
the character - the impetuosity, the 
ambiJUity, the charisma - right down to the 
Polish accent. Also appearing (overweight 
and out of place) is Alan Bates, the great 
Thomu Hardy king of hearts.

song, a cover of Ray Davies 
"Stop Your Sobbing," which 
carries the strong stink of Nick 
Lowe's smugly safe pop 
arrangements. 

The richness of Hynde's 
voice pula her competitors to 
shame, calling to mind Ronnie 
Spector or Roger Daltrey 
more than Patti Smith, Rachel 
Sweet (yech) or "opera singer" 
Pat Benatar. The Pretender. 
as a band are good, but not 
great by any means. Jame.

not, and Pete Farndon's chief

messy baas playing. Martin

drumming is the exception: 
he's the best rock drummer 
I've heard since Paul Cook, 
and he's Oambouyant as Keith 
Moon. 

A lot of credit must be given 
to Baltimore's Maryland 
Sound, who did the best mix 
I've heard in San Diego-
super loud, super-clean-and 
to Larry Peterson's lighting, 
which was more than 
adequate. But Sunday night 
all anyone could see was 
Chrissy Hynde, a girl from 
Akron, Ohio who brought 
rock and roD home to the 
U.S.A. Sure, .he'. got a wall,
