A.S. Council 
reinstates MacCrone 
M UIR College Council (MCC) reinstated Greg MacCrone as senior senator 10 the AS. yesterday on the grounds that hiS terminal ion was not III accordance with constitution 
bylaws. 

The A.s. judiCial board only has .rhc power to. remove 
campuswlde elected officials. MacCrone IS a representallVe to Ihe 
A.S. and docs not hold office as a result of general eleCtIons. 

"Greg was never kicked off in our eyes... as MCC IS an 
autonomous body, they (A. .) have no jurisdiction over us," 
explained Kevin Tonai, MCC chairperson , 

MacCrone was removed from the A.S. last fa ll for allegedly 
assuming the chair illegaUy when council chairperson Greg Hom 
became ill. , 

For the past few months , MacCrone has bee~ attemptmg to 
rectify the situation through "student channels. Accordtng to 
MacCrone he wanted the judicial board to rehear hiS case and 
ultimately reverse the decision . 

The A.S. never attempted to contact MCC regarding MacCrone's 
removal. This inaction is <::o ntrary to the autonomous nature of the 
A.s. and MCC. 

Greg McCambridge was removed as interim Muir senior senator 
when MacCrone was reinstated. d

leadmg to Mathewson s arrest. Lam, of Westlake Village, had been 
studying pre-EECS., He was a Warren College student.

Emergency ordinance extension sought 
By JAMES Q. GILMORE 

T HE San Diego City Council mel January 20 to consider extending 
emerge ncy ordinance number 0-
t6743, which establishes a 

onditlonal Usc Permit (CUP) 
process for hazardous waste 
treatment research , development 
and demonstration facilities. The 
ordinance was adopted October 
28 of last year, in response to 
General Atomic Technologies' 
intention to begin routine testing 
of their Circulation Bcd 
Co mbustor (CBC). 

advocated by the City Council 
Planning Commission and the 
Envlronmnetal Health Coalit ion 
(EHC), the council members 
voted for a compromise 
extension. The plannners will 
have four months to complete a 
permanent ordi'lance which 
outlines a procedure for 
obtaining a CUP. 

Diane Takvorian, of the EHC, 
thinks that four months is "an 
inadequate amount of time" for 
the pla)1ning staff to come up 
with the permanent ordinance , 
and suggested the possibility thai 
the planners may need to ask for 
an extension, 

Federation 01 Women 's luhs, 
which represents 40 thousund 
women, offered tesllmony in 
support of the CBC program. 

Before GNOES can begin 
further testl ng and 
demonstration of Iheir CBC. the} 
must obtain permits from the 
San Diego Air Pollution Control 
District, the State Depanment of 
Health Services (DHS), the 
Federal EPA, and , in accordance 
with the ordinance passed last 
October 28, the City of San 
Diego. 

Once the city cOllles up with 
the permanent ordinance, there 
will be two public hearings, one 
at the Planning Commission leve 
and one at the City CounCil 
level. 

The DHS is currently working 

on Iheir permit and reViewing an 
environmental risk assessment 
conducted at their request by 
Radian Corporation, a private 
consulklnt firm . As the lead 
agency in this process. the DHS 
will determine whether an 
Environmental Impact Report is 
needed . 

RhOI' estimates the DHS will be 
completed wilh their draft permll 
sometime in April or early May, 
after which they will announce a 
date for a public hearing. Copies 
of Ihe dmft permit will be 
distributed to public libraries 
thiny days before the heanng for 
public review. 

The EPA is also still involved 
in their own review process. 
respondmg to comments on 
theIr draft permit for GNOES, 

and Will Issue a fmal revised 
edition of the permit within the 
next few months, 

According to test data present 
m the Execulive Summary of the 
nsk assessment conduc ted by 
Radian Corporation, the private 
firm concludes that, "there would 
be neither adverse health effects 
to the surrounding population 
including senSItive ?opulations 
nor adverse environmental 
effects associated with operation 
of the CBC." The study was 
based on a "worst case scenario" 
which purposely overestimated 
the health effects that might 
occur through op.:ration of the 
CBC. The four chemical 
compounds selected for the 
analysis were Dioxin , PCB, 

Plea§( tum [0 page 7 

As of January, GA 
Technologies sold the CBC 
project organization to Ogden 
Envi ronmental Services (OES), 
which is now considered a 
tCllant on the sprawling GA 
dukedom off Genessee Avenue 
and North Torrey Pines Road . 
The New York based OES is 
involved in the operation of 
environmental research recovery 
and waste treatment 

The compromise decision 
reached by the council was 
Influe nced by testimony in 
support of the CBC project. Bob 
Smothers, Vice President of 
General Serviees at ncighbori ng 
Scripps Clinic, urged that in 
their deliberatiOns, th e Ciry 
Planning Commission make the 
distinction between research and 
developmer.t activities and 
commercial waste treatment 
issues. The CBC project staff at 
GNOES, a research and 
development firm, has been 
pushing for Ihe recognition of 
thi s distinction. 

Brown calls to abolish fees 
tech nologies. 

The CBC applies newly 
developed techniques of toxic 
waste incineration, which 
GNOES' test data show to be 
both environmentally safe and 
effiCient, After further testing and 
development, GA hopes to 
eveJ1tually market larger copies of 
their pilot CBC to industries 
which generate toxic waste. 

According to Mya Rhor, Permit 
Manager of the CBC program, 
the meeting with the City 
Counci l was "a major milestone." 
Instead of extending the 
ordinance to the one year 

Speaking on behalf of Scripps 
Clinic, Smothers also said , "We 
are convinced, based on data we 
have reviewed and discussions ' 
we have held with technical 
experts in the field that there 
exists no hazard to the public ."

.. Thursday, FehrUaf), 12, 1987 

Are you sometimes angered wuh the university? When you walk mto an 
overcrowded classroom , .Ire you angered when 50 sealS .Ire unoccupied because of 
disrepair and }'OU arc forced to sit on the floor? Are you angered when }'OU find that 
the parking lot you p,m.l S I 01:1 [0 usc ha~ Just been re-zoned ~o Ihdt there are 75 
unused "A" Spots and 15 .. -" SPOIS occupied by fJculry? Arc you angered when the 
fmancial aid offl e mlsplJces ,\ form and asually infllims you that you will have to 
come up with ~500 by fnday 01 you Will be dropped from all your classes? Are you 
angered by polt e ofTl ers who regard you .IS sub-human, or admillistratlve deCisions 
that reflect corporate or milital)' interests at the expense of the student body? 

~Iudenl communit}' in the governance o f their own nll ai rs. As exemplified by the 
p,lthctlc turnouts during the AS. elections, Stale of Campus Addresses or AS. Council 
meetings, a student who scrutinizes the system soon discovers that there is little he 
or she can do to influence the deciSions of the student government. If. for some 
reason Ihey could , they would soon discover that the AS. is a little more than a 
powerless truclure erected by a repressive administration in the mid-70s in an 
attempt to pacify the student body, 

UC 0 has always suffered from an acute case 01 polilical apathy dUring the winter 
months Naturally , our chamable admml trators have noticed thiS ,lI1d used It to their 
advantage. At the present time, however, the student body has been given an unusu,11 
opportunity to rectify the problem. Petitioners are presently circulating the campus 
caUlIlg for an Immedlale convenmg of a constitutional convention. 

To give a poignant example of how the AS. ei ther wiltingly or unwirtingly acts in 
accordant'e with administr-.ttive strategies. every council since 1983 - with the 
possible exception of the present one - has either ignored or fought the 
enforcement of student lIlitiauves that were nO! written by the council itself. President 
Riley's claim in laSt week's Guardian that "ir has always gone wi thoul sayi ng that A . 
considers any student initiatives binding policy" is pure persi flage, This claim of 
Riley's is not only hi torically untrue, but shows that even a supposedly independent 
AS president can become partisan to dis informaiion campaigns. orne may not be aware of Ihe rewards that can be reaped from reforming the A 

Constitution. The goal of such a process IS to regam control of student government in 
which we have mvested a great deal of money and aspira tions, and as a group, 
become a true pan of a deCIsion-making process Ihat has continued to operate 
behind our backs 111 an undemocratic fJshion , 

One of the duties o[ the A . CouncIl, whether they choose to realize it or not, is to 
seize eve!)' chance available m order to Incorporate Ihe vast m"Jonry of the UC 0 

In the following weeks, the Guardian will be analyzi ng the present AS. Constitution 
in depth and will be making various proposals as to what the potentially new 
constitution can do for the studcnt body. We urge you to partic ipate in this process 
and sign the petitions calling for the convening of the constitutional convent ion in 
order 10 empower fhe student body with the force it has been denied for so many 
years. -M,S. & MJ.C

LATE yesterday afternoon, I was invited by a local deity to visit the place where 
yuppies are manufactured. 

aturally, I couldn't resl t, and 
was instantly whisked off to 
Torrance, Cahfornla , the 
binhplace of all YUPpies 

IdentiCorp IS located in a 
large, nondescript group of 
bUlldmgs in a Torrance IIldustrial 
park. I was dIrected to the 
admlllistrative offices where I 
was surprised to learn that 
IdenuCorp IS a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of TRW, which m 
tum IS its largest customer. The 
preSident. Roger Schwartz, 
offered to give me an executive 
tour of the plant. He tossed me a 
lukewanm Shaeffer bee! and we 
started down the hallway. 
dlscu smg the yuppie bU511less 

"Yuppie, are a very pro litable 
Item." he began. "Every large 
corporation has a hundred-und-
one uses [or them. Programmed 
properly, they can do anythmg 
from housecleanrng to brain 
surgery. They are Ialr!}' reliable 
and require very lillie 
maintenance. They are fun to 
abuse. and as long as they can 
wear a three-piece SUit, and 
Ihink they arc superior to 
someone else. they don 't really 
care about the pay." 

"We have been manufactunng 
yuppies for a little over four 
years." Roger continued , "Before I 
started IdennCorp , I was the 
program dlreclor at a local Han 
Knshna temple doing the same 
SO It of thing. but making very 
little money One ddy a fnend 

Cells 
hired me to rum hi kid mto a 
Republican It was" simple, 
freelance Job , but it got me 
thinking. I staned to ask around . 
I caUed ome of the larger 
computer finms and finanCial 
mStltulions and asked them what 
they would require from the ideal 
subordinate . After a month , I was 
ready 10 SIan IdentiCorp, With 
the finanCIal blessing of TRW." 

We alTlved at the receiving 
room. where some 'raw matenal' 
had Just arrived , Forklifts 
unloaded palarres of sedated

people, roughly fourteen to 
fifteen years old , were washed by

Followlllg the last of the

Roger led me past a door marked 
'Conditioning, I.' We entered a 
room with a row of theater-like

entire condi tioning room . There ,

the conditioning room and a 
large screen illuminated before

women, designer drinking water

Here the yuppies entered 
another machine. and exi ted 
clean- haven with three-piece 
SUits and deSigner sunglasses. 
They proceeded outside to a 
vacant parking lot where they 
practiced yuppie driving skill s. 
One group sat in a row of BMWs 
and practiced flash mg high-
beams and honking horns at 
passing motorists. Another group 
was learning how to drag-race 
the Iinle cars and cut in front of 
eaeh other while pretending to 
talk on the car phone. In the 
building, the yuppies were lined 
up and fed a sedative solution, 
After the drug took effect, 
employees loaded the yuppies 
into hermetically-sealed plastic 
bags and carefully packed them 
in padded canons with 
documentation envelopes. I 
leafed through an owner's 
manual which instructed the new 
owner to .. . .. if possible, lead 
your new Drone to believe that 
he will at one time become vice-
president of your company. 
Although some of your 

employees may undergo 
un neccesary harassment, your 
Drone will require very little 
monetary compensation from 
you for quite some time ." 

"Is (hat all?" I asked Roger 
Schwartz. 

"No, there is one more 
department that will surely 
interest you," Roger said as we 
crossed a parking lot and 
entered a building marked 
'Quality Control.' 

"Here we take care of the 
defective yuppies and warranry 
repairs ," he added. "Occasionally 
one will revolt against its owner, 
usually because of excessive 
maltreatment. We specifically 
state in the owners manual thal 
prolonged underpayment or 
physical abuse may provoke 
yuppies to disobey orders or 
degenerate into useless things 
such as musicians or writers." 

I observed one sorry case with 
purple hair trying to wrestle his 
guitar from a service technician. 
"This one's 'particulary tough ," 
sighed Roger. "He may have to 
come work for us."

Editor: 

I would like to respond to 
John Riley'S and Eric Weiss' 
letter criticizing the initi ative for 
a constitutional convention and 
the proposals put forth by the 
Committee for the Democratic 
Initiative . The roUowing points of 
our proposals need clarification 
because they were either 
misunderstood or 
misrepresented. 

1) A propomonal 
~prlleJUation system for the AS. 
is workable (it works fine in 
unilltl'Sities around the world , 
especially in Europe) and is also 
able [0 incorporate the present 
structure of the AS. 
Commissioners, and Vice-
Presidents would be appointed 
with approval from the elected 
AS. Council members and by the 
President. Thus authoriry is 

delegated effiCiently, just as 
before , 

2) Input into council 
meetings; Riley's and Weiss' 
assertion that student input at 
the beginning of council 
meetings is suffi cient might hold

Move over StoufIers! 
Creative College Cuisine 
By CINDY CHESY 

On Monday )'OU cat macaroni 
and cheese , for Tuesday 1['S TV 
dinners; Wednesday IS pb and J 
night; and on Thur day you 
mIght open a can of soup. If 
these meals sound all roo 
famIliar, maybe u's time to Invest 
In a cookbook. . 

The Collegiate Cookbook. 
which ha been on the market 
for Just three weeks, may fIt 
your needs. It ·s dlready dvallabk 
at aU CalIfornia college book 
stores, and Waldenbooks. 

The CollegIate Cookbook was 
written by Coronado reSIdent 
Lynn Shinn. Shinn I a former 
staff member at Mademoiselle , 
Vogue, and Glamour; he also 
currently works as a free-lance 
writer for San Diego based Ranch 
and Coast MagaZIne. 

Shinn arrived at the idea of 
writing 1I cookbook after listening 
to her son Clay's weekly requests 
for dehcious, easy, economIcal 
recipes that he could whip up In 
his college apartment. "Clay 
moved into UC D's tudent 

"The book is (for) the 
busy student, short of 
. d h " tIme an cas ... 

apartments on campus and 
started the year with a full meal 
plan in the college cafetena," 
Shinn saId . "He soon found that 
his taste in food dId nOt 
COinCIde with the cafeteria's fare. 
Gradually, he dropped the meal 
plan and took up the unfamiliar 
sport of cookIng." 

Shinn began wntlng the 
cookbook after she receIved the 
results from two national 
computer searches of cookbooks. 
These results Indicated that there 
was a definite need for a 
cookbook that catered 
specifically to students, who 
don't have much time to spend 

In the kitchen. " tudents don't 
want to spend hours cooking an 
elaborate meal, yet they want to 
eat somethIng that tastes good ," 
ShInn sa Id . "I found that mosl of 
Ihe cookbooks geared tOward 
college sludents are inadequate 
be ause Ihey feature gourmet 
reCipes for 6 to 12 or are 
ethnically or diet onented ." 

While complhng recipes for 
The CollegIate Cookbook. hinn 
pored over hundreds of reCIpe 
books, replacing, adding and 
dclenng Ingredients to come up 
with the simplest, shortest and 
best-tastIng dishes for the 
'ookbook. ShIn n, d elf-
des ribed "short Ut semi-
gourmet cook," said that she 
began lookIng lor shortcuts. 
"Instead of an elaborate sauce, I 
put In a can of soup, for 
example. Also, I frequently 
replaced three or more 
seasonings with one seasonIng. 
These shortcuts reduced the 
number of ingredients in each 
recipe ," she satd . 

All of the re IpeS In The 
CollegIate Cookbook average five 
to seven ingredients and each 
use foods Ihal a student would 
mosl likely have in Ihe kitchen. 

There arc other differences 
between The Collegiate 
Cookbook and other cookbooks. 
"II IS Ihe only cookbook for 
students that Includes a nutrition 
chart. a list of foods to eat under 
the stress of exams, coping skills, 
suggestions on how to cook 
varIOUS vegetables and meats, 
microwave hints and over 200 
recipes:' 

There arc six general 
categones, including breakfast, 
lunch and desserts, but Ihe 
dInner secllon is what makes the 
book worth bUyIng. The dinner 
recipes are short. serve one to 
two people , don't usc a lot of 
expe nsive ingredients and are 
delicious. There arc plenty of 
reCipes for the meat cater as well

By JACK BERESFORD 

U C D might be looking at a new n:.ltional championsh ip . hut not

expect 

Led by Its new coach. thiS 
years surf team promlscs to he 
one of the best smce 1982. when 
It won the State Championship. 
Ed Machado, who IS also a 
volleybaU Instructor here . took 
command of the team last fall 
with th e goal of taking It to 
Huntington Beach next August 
where th e best collegiate surf 
teams In the nation will compete 
m the National Championships. 

And if, as they sa)'. wmnIng IS 
contageous. thiS team should 
have no trouble at all . Machado 
was an Ali-American Volleyhall 
player at UCLA in 1971 and led 

Our 'special teams' 
are awesome ... " 
-Coach Machado 
hiS surf team there to two 
championships. 

Now in his role as coach , 
Machado hopes to bring back 
the win ning tradition that Tmon 
surfers have established despite 
the school's Division III stand ing 
"This IS one of the few spons 

. that we can go head to head 
with teams from USC and 
SDSU." 

And that IS Just what they did 
last unday In MISSion Beach. 
the UCSD teams finished third 
and foul1h in a field of 15 teams 
from throughout California. 

Sophomore Allen johnson led the 
way m hiS first contest With the 
team finishing a strong third in 
thl' men 's findl. johnson. who IS 
a transfer student from the 
Flonda I nstilute of Te hnology. 
creults the leams success to tWO 
LIClorS. ''l'd say it's both greal 
organizitlion and strong sc hool 
suppOrt thai our team's a 
success. " 

BUI gnou coaching means 
nothing wlthoul a well of 
talent and coach Machado 
pOI ntS to h 15 team' t,llent a IlS 
strength. "Our 'special teams' arc 
awesome - we have a chance of 
wmni ng eve l), diviSIOn: mens. 
women. kneeriders, and 
bodybo'lrd ," said Machado. 

ThiS plliRt was made obVIOUS 
lasl weedend as the UC D-B 
team . normally a second string 
squad, filllshcd ahead of the "A" 
team m the final standings. Both 
ddeated UC Santa Barbara's 
temn. which is the twO time 
N.tlIonal ~hampion. 

The team's nexi comesl IS 
Fcbru.H), 21 In OceanSide 
against USC. UCLA and SDSU. 
and then March 13 and 14 at 
the ewpon Bea h River jetties. 
Team points are accumulaled at 
eac h event and Ihe top teams are 
se lec[ed to surf in the National 
Championships held annually a t 
the HuntingtOn Beach pier. 

Coach Machado says [hat any 
support IS welcome and that 
anyone interested in Joining the 
team should contaCt him at 436-
1997. or check the Surf Team 
bulle tin board located 111 the

their Spuds t-shirts will receive some special gifts. and ma)tle even a 
chance to split a pitcher or two with your canine buddy, So. be sure to

us may not have a Valentine, we

If you're looking for Prince 

Charming, the trick may lie in 
visualizing your prince, 
deciding if he's

your prince and 
trust you. At least, 
some of the tips advoc 
Tracy Cabot in her new 
How to Make a Man 
Looe with You. Critics 
scoff at the prospect 
"making love happen," but 
Cabot's book is chock full of 
tips designed to make meeting 
the man of your dreams more 
than just a chance encounter. 

Tracy Cabot received her 
Ph.D. in psychology from 
Pacific Western University in 
Los Angeles, She has been a 
freelance writer for 20 years 
and now conducts her own 
private practice. Cabot is 
living proof that her methods 
work: "I started the book 

by krisrina Hem 
when 'l was 39 and single, and 1 with a chapter on "what not to 
finished it right before I got do" and continues with how 
married. The problem with to recognize and break out of 
women in my age group is that the "bastard trap" getting 
there is a shortage of men stuck in bad situations with 
between the ages of 47 and 52 , men who are not right for you. 
Several wars, from World Subsequent chapters cover 
War II up until the Vietnam the gamut from formulating a 
War, had taken a lot of them personalized "man plan" to 

women these deciding how much to give to 
younger preventing jealousy. 

older A specialized technique 

to 
and 

after it, 
people 

once they 
adopted these techniques, it 
rcally turned their lives 
around," 

The techniques that Cabot 
refers to are a mixture of 
behavior modifi ca tidn, 
human psychology, and 
intuition, Her book begins 

described in the book is called 
"mirroring." It is cited as a 
good way to make the 
transition from friendship to a 
closer relationship: "Mirror-
ing is a very powerful 
technique for getting close to 
someone . Without being 
overly noticeable, you can 
learn to dress, sit, and move 
the way that your man does. 
It's a way of being "in sync" 
with a man, getting him to pay 
attention to you. Afterwards, 
you have to start communica-
tion with him so that the two 
of you will build trust - it's 
the first step before 
intimacy," 

Communication with a 
man is another area that 
Cabot spends a lot of time on. 

The book teaches the reader 
how to listen and react to a 
man's conversation, stressing 
that being too strident or 
seeming "needy" tends to 
turn people off. 

Cabot's book is based on a 
wealth of experience: "It wasa 
mixture of my experiences, 
my friends ' experiences, and 
principles of psychology. I did 
a lot of research into what 
causes that feeling of being in 
love and how we get people to 
do what we want. This was a 
very easy book to write, I had 
all the research already and I 
know that it works. It really 
flowed." 

How to make a Man Fall in 
Love with You tends to 
oversimplify and generalize in 
many spots , but ' the 
information imparted could 
really be helpful for those of 
us who've tried every thinK 
and found nothing that 
works. So if Cupid's arrow 
hasn't struck yet, maybe it's 
high time we got behind the 
bow. 

Cabot's book retails for 
$3.50.

Program in its annual 
" Evenmg of Dance" in the 
Mandeville Auditorium on 
February 13 and 14 at 8 
pm. 

The program, which 
consists of all faculty 
works, explores many 
different themes of dance, 
from "Floppy Disk," 
Marshall's imaginative jazz 
piece which examines the 
future influence of 
computers 10 the work 
place, to " Fandangos de 
Huelva," by Debbi e 
Escobosa, a traditional 
Spanish Flamenco dance. 

Rincon, who is the 
Director of the Jazz 

Berlin Wall may have divided 
a country, but people oftl'n 
build walls Without the lise of 
oncrete. As the play 

discern i ngly demonstrates, 
emotional walls, walls of fear, 
prejudice and mistrust can be 
as alienating and damaging as 
walls made of brick. 

The cast consists uf a group 
of travelers who have little in 
common except for their 
deSire to reach the city of 
Berlin. In order to do so, they 
must cross a lake - a task 
which turns out to be 
impossible. The main obstacle 
is represented by a soldier 
who is under orders not to let 
anything cross the lake. The

Music with a conscience IRSm • • trIVIa 
In 1963, when Dr . Martin 

Luther King, Jr. delivered his 
historical "1 Have a Dream" 
speech in WashlOgton D.C., 
the folk trio of Peter, Paul and 
Mary were right there beside 
him to sing the classic Boh 
Dylan tune "Blowin' in the 
Wind." A quarter of a 
century later the threesome 
was once again in Washing-
ton, this time at the side of 
Bishop Desmond Tutu, 
singing the same song for the 
same basic cause; human 
rights. 

The socio-political folk 
group, consisting of Peter 
Yarrow, Noel Paul Stookey 

'and Mary Travers, has 
recently released their first 
album in more than six years. 
It is not something to miss. 

Involved in their thud 
decade of performing, writing 
and recording folk music, 
Peter, Paul and Mary's familiar 
harmonies and thought 
provoking lyrics so.und 
neither stale nor out of date. 
Because their music remains 
pertment In the '80s, they 
don't solely rely on older fans 
because they are constantly 
acquiring new ones. 

"A wonderful thmg about 
folk musIC," Mary Travers 
explains, "is that it's multi-

by mark pinkus 
generational. What we see at 
our concerts, for instance, is 
many generations; we see 
three and sometimes even 
four. It's the kind of show the 
whole family enjoys." 

For those that have been 
fortunate to see a PP&M 
concert they can vouch for 
Travers' comment where 
young kids are often seen 
enjoying themselves as much 
as their grandparents. 

When questioned about 
smging songs written more 
than 20 years ago Travers 
responded, "The ones that we 
sing have stayed relevant. I 
have sung the line 'How many 
years can some people eXist 
before they're allowed to be 
free' (from Dylan's 'Blowm' 
in the Wind') for 25 years. 1 
have sung it for refusednik 
Jews in little apartments in 
Moscow. I've also sung It with 
Bishop Tutu and I've sung it in 
prisons in El Salvador." 

PP&M's new album, "No 
Easy Walk to Freedom," 
contains the same strong 

, 

messages as earlier works but 
pertains to the rroblems of 
today. Apartheid and Central 
America are two of the major 
situations dealt with. 

The title song "No Easy 
Walk to Freedom," written 
by Paul Yarrow and Margery 

Tabankm(to whom the album 
dedicated to her for all the 
work she's done for the 
group) acts as an up-beat anti-
apartheid anthem. Switching 
off on lines dunng the verses 
the three join in together to 
belt out the hnes, "Keep on 
walking and apartheid will 
fall. No easy walk to freedom. 
Keep on walking and we shall 
be free. That's how we're 
gomg to make history." 

The slower-paced song "EI 
Salvador ," wntten by Paul 
Stookey resembles the 
moving songs of the late '60s 
which dealt with Vietnam. 
Paul SlOgS most of the songs In 
a sarcastic tone. The mood at 
the end of "El Salvador" is 
different as the final lme 
displays Paul in a plead 109 
tone askmg, "Who put thiS 
price on their liberty? Don't 
you think it's time to leave EI 
Sal vador?" 

With their 25 years of great 
music commemorated on the 
Amencan Music Awards two 
weeks ago, the question IS 
how much longer can it go on. 
Even With a slight laugh it was 
apparent that Travers was 
senous when she remarked, 
"Pete Seeger is 67 and he's 
still dOing concerts so who 
knows? I don't really think 
about that. "

'A creative 
menu 

by david f(I'[1l3l1 
Two plays, one directed by 

UCSD professor Farrell 
Foreman, and the other 
direered by his wife Sandra 
Sydney, will take to the stage at 
the new Warren Apartment's 
Commons building, as Black 
History Celebration continues 
at U(9). Farrell Foreman. who 
came to UaD as a leader of the 
Early Outreach Program in 
1984, will direct a cast of 
students in the play "Black 
Gravy," from a scriIX he wrote in 

1~, when he was 'a gradu~te 

student at UQD. 
The comedy revolves around 

a restaurant owned by a 
husband and wife, Cesar and 

Abigail During a lat~ night 
poker game, Cesar offers 
samples of his new secret gravy 
recipe to his friends. The other 
men go nuts over the flamr, and 
by the time Cesar and Abigail 
wake up the next morning worcl 
has spread, and a line of over 
100 people has focmed around 
the restaurant What Cesar 
chooses to do with his recipe 
and the newly found fame that 
ensues (a corporation offers 
him over a quarter million 
dollars fex the rights to the 
recipe) serves as the basis of the 
story. 

A highli~ht f the how 
comes at the beginning of the 
second act, when prominent 
people around UQD, sU h as 
Vice Chan ellor of Under-
graduate Affairs Dr. Joseph 
Watson, and the head of the 
Bridge program Dr. A10n ro 
Anderson, make ad-lib cameo 
appearan es as drifters and 
10 als who stir up action in the 
restaurant. A different cameo is 
scheduled for each perfor-
mance. 

black wom~n \Wit~rs, including 
Alic~ Walk~r and Toni 
Morrison. Th~ play touches on 
issues such as race discrimina-
tion, class conficts, and the 
competition of women against 
other wom~n. 

"Black Gravy" is only one of 
many plays writt~n by Farrell 
Foreman, in a career that up to 
this point has proven to be 
successful. In 1982, he 
graduated with an MJiA. in play 
\Witing. That same year, h is first 
play was produced, "Daddy's 
Seashore B1ues," which earned 
him a Samuel Goldwyn Award 
and a National Endowment foc 
Arts in the area of p1ay.....,-iting. 
He moved to Dallas for a year 
befexe returning to U(9) in 

1~. In the fall of 1985, he 
began working atOasis and has 
since sd up the Scholars' 
Writing WockshoPi a program 
within Oasis target~d toward 
helping minority groups and 
other students with honors 
potential to improve their 
writing. Though many of his 
plays wer~ designed with a 
black audience in mind, they 
have been praised by critics 
and fans of all races. "Black 
Gravy" will be performed 
tonight, February 14,21,and22 
at 8 pm, and "Black Doves" will 
show on February 13 at 8 pm 
and on the 18, with showings at 
2 pm and 8 pm. Both shows are 
free of charge, and all are 
wdcome to attend. 

"Black Doves" is more a 
compilation poetry, short 
stories and dramatic sequences 
than an actual story. Put 
together this quarter by Sandra 
Sydney, its common thread is 
that all the writi ng was done by 

The home of the 
3~¢ haITlburger.

National Theatre of Bucharest 
as a dramaturge for three 
years, and with the help of an 

American critiC, she 
immigrated to the United
