Campus police and administrators 
at UC Santa Cruz are taking greater 
measures this year to dissuade thou-
sands of students and marijuana 
enthusiasts from congregating on 
campus for the annual April 20 mari-
juana festival.

Participation in the 2009 festi-
val will be discouraged with barri-
cades, stringent parking enforcement, 
restricted shuttle access and a ban on 
overnight guests in university housing 
from April 17 to April 20.

Thousands of students and com-

munity members gather every year in 
Porter Meadow to smoke and ingest 
cannabis, filling the sky with a haze 
of smoke. 

Though the tradition began 20 
years ago, UCSC spokesman Jim 
Burns — who has worked there for 24 
years — said the event has attracted an 
unmanageable number of participants 
within the last several years.

Officials first attempted to 
crack down last year, after receiv-
ing increased public attention that 
stemmed partly from the publication 
of an article in Rolling Stone magazine 
about the university’s reputation as a 
stoner campus.

“Obviously, this isn’t something 
that the university wants to be associat-
ed with,” Santa Cruz City Councilman 
Mike Rotkin said. “The university 
took similar precautions for the first 
time last year, but it didn’t seem to 
curb the number of students and com-
munity members from attending.”

Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Fellicia McGinty recently sent an 
e-mail to students and parents of fresh-
men labeling the event unsanctioned 
and unwelcome, calling it an “illegal 
activity that diminishes UCSC’s repu-
tation and draws negative attention to

Just two weeks after the UC Board 
of Regents awarded salary increases to 
several top executives, UC President 
Mark G. Yudof introduced a plan last 
week that would reduce UC employee 
salaries and implement furloughs in 
an effort to combat the state budget 
crisis. The plan will be presented at the 
regents’ May meeting at UCSD.

“My goal is to produce for con-
sideration by the regents, in May, a 
flexible regental standing order that 
would serve as a broad legal frame-
work to allow for both systemwide 
and campus-by-campus furloughs and 
salary reductions, should deteriorating 
financial conditions so require,” Yudof 
said in a statement last week. 

Yudof also advised that the roles and 
responsibilities of the regents, chancel-

About 10 percent of the $20.7 mil-
lion in UCSD’s annual registration-
fee funds — which have historically 
supported student services — will 
help fill gaps from state-funding 
reductions for the 2009-10 academic 
year. Administrators say the cuts will 
most likely  threaten student services 
in the form of programming, events 
and staffing levels. 

The campuswide deficit next 
year is expected to range from $450 
million to $700 million, $115 mil-
lion of which stem from state fund-
ing cuts. In response, the Student 
Affairs Office, which oversees the 
funds, has charged the 17 members 
on the  Registration Fee Advisory 
Committee with prioritizing each of 
26 registration fee-funded units — 
including the Student Health Center, 
Career Services Center, university 
centers and campus recreation — to 
ensure the least amount of damage to 
programming. 

The committee is still debating 
whether to make an across-the-board 
cut or investigate which specific stu-
dent services could afford greater 
funding slashes. 

Funding accrued from the cut 
will then be converted to general 
funds, about 70 percent of which 
goes toward academic affairs such 
as admissions and maintaining the 
availability of classes, salary and 
inflation adjustments, previous over-
enrollment and staffing. 

Committee chair and graduate 
student Garo Bournoutian said reg-
istration-fee funds need to be sepa-
rated from budget cuts in order to 
maintain the availability of student 
services. 

“Students are paying [money] 
specifically for these services, and 
they’re independent of the state,” 
Bournoutian said. “You’re still paying 
the same amount, so you should be 
getting the same services. It doesn’t 
make sense that because the state’s 
losing money, the reg fee gets cut to 
make up for it.”

Bournoutian said that in the 
1970s, the regents separated the cur-
rent $288 registration fee from the 
$2,087 education fee to protect stu-
dent services from budget reductions, 

Budget constraints force 
administrators to seek 
out internal funding from 
student affairs office.

UCSD’s student-run cooperatives 
are free of their debt to the A.S. coun-
cil today after councilmembers voted 
last night to pay off over $35,000 
in back rent accrued by the Food 
Co-op, the General Store Co-op, 
Groundwork Books and the Che Cafe 
during their 2004 space-agreement 
negotiations.

The council voted unanimously 
to absorb the $35,408.37 sum after an 
impassioned presentation by co-op 
employees and supporters. 

The council will allocate $12,426.06 
to the Food Co-op, $12,392.00 to the 
General Store Co-op, $7,083.88 to 
Groundwork Books and $3,506.43 to 
the Che Cafe. This sum will be taken 
from the council’s mandate reserves, 
a fund that Revelle College Senator 
Katie Hall described as a general 
account set aside for emergencies. 

Food Co-op core member Daniel 
Nguyen gave a presentation at the 
meeting outlining the history of the 
four co-ops’ debt and the reasons 

it should be forgiven. According to 
Nguyen, the master space agreement 
— a contract enacted in 1993 that 
resembled a landlord-tenant agree-
ment between the university and the 
co-ops — ended in 2000, leaving the 
co-ops without an official contract. 

According to Hall, the council 
did not renew this contract when it 
expired  in 2000, although it was an 
A.S. responsibility. Following this, the 
university sent the co-ops an eviction 
notice in 2004. 

“We didn’t think about it until 
2004, [at which time] the co-ops 
decided to renegotiate the contracts 
[because] they weren’t happy with the 
old one,” Hall said. 

The negotiation period that fol-
lowed lasted for two years, during 
which no official contract existed 
between the university and the co-
ops. Also during this time, Student 
Center construction interfered with 
co-op functionality, in turn causing 
greater disagreements about rent. 

According to Nguyen, the co-ops 
stopped paying rent to the university 
at this time because they did not agree 
upon a contract and because the con-
struction obstructed co-op entrances 
and blocked off the Food Co-op’s

Co-op employees make 
case before receptive 
councilmembers.

kitchen, dramatically hindering the 
co-ops’ livelihood. 

“Until this, co-ops were very con-
sistent [in paying their rent],” Nguyen 
said. “It’s not because of being finan-
cially irresponsible, but because our 
existence at this point was being 
threatened.”

According to Nguyen, a new mas-
ter space agreement was decided upon 
in June 2006, and the co-ops were sent 
a $35,408.37 bill for expenses accrued 
during the lengthy negotiations. 

“Since 2006, they’ve paid off a 
significant portion of the debt,” Hall 
said. “They’ve been paying off debt 
for years when they could be expand-

ing to offer new services. We decided 
to forgive the debt. We really sup-
port the co-ops. It’s one of the only 
completely student-owned assets on 
campus and a great way for people to 
get involved.”

The council was remarkably adept at moving through the numerous items on the agen-
da at last night’s meeting, without the 
usual heavy and circular discussion.

The minutes from the first week 
were revised to excuse All-Campus 
Senator David Ritcherson’s absence, 
on the account of an e-mail commu-
nication error. 

Transportation and Parking 
Services Director Brian 
D’Autremont’s presentation on his 
office’s workings was eclipsed by the 
30 or so members 
of the public who 
joined the coun-
cilmembers at the 
Price Center East 
Forum to speak 
in favor of reliev-
ing the debt of the 
UCSD co-ops. 

“Not only have we’ve sacrificed 
the needs of our workers but we’ve 
also ignored the needs of our custom-
ers,” Physical Sciences Senator Daniel 
Nguyen said. 

With a decisive 25 votes in favor, 
and one abstention, the council wrote 
off the debt. Members of the public 
cheered and literally jumped for joy at 
the news. 

Vice President of External Affairs 
Lisa Chen discussed the D.R.E.A.M. 
Act in relation to the UC system, 
which was followed with a timely yet 
brief discussion of alcohol policies 
and ways to thwart crafty undercover 
police come Sun God 2009. 

Associate Vice President of Athletic 
Affairs Peter Benesch wondered aloud 
whether it is a good idea to run away 
if approached with the unattractive 
possibility of being charged with an 
alcohol-related crime. 

“Fleeing is never a good idea,” 
Associate Vice President of Student 
Advocacy Frank Carroll replied deci-

sively, before informing everyone in 
the room of their right to refuse to 
submit to a search.

Advocate General Chris Rebert 
motioned to postpone indefinitely 
the impeachments of Ritcherson and 
Social Sciences Senator Nicole Carroll, 
which were approved with surprisingly 
little discourse. Both senators were in 
attendance at the meeting. 

Since the issue of the changes to the 
funding process for student organiza-
tions was split last week, the creation 
of the Student Organization Funding 

Advisory Board 
was addressed 
in Unfinished 
Business.  

Sixth College 
Senator John 
Cressey explained 
that he did not rel-

ish the idea of creating a new commit-
tee of appointees when the senators are 
more than capable of undertaking the 
funding responsibilities. 

“I feel like its really hard and 
kind of unrealistic to expect any-
one from any student org to under-
stand this funding process to such a 
degree,” Associate Vice President of 
Academic Affairs Lana Blank said. 
“I don’t think it’s responsible to do 
this now with a new council com-
ing in. We’re basically writing a new 
system and saying now you have to 
deal with it.”

A Finance Restructuring 
Committee was created with the aim 
of reorganizing the finance committee 
so that it could meet the stipulations 
of the new system of allocating A.S. 
funds; the committee would dissolve 
next Wednesday. 

President Donna Bean gave the 
council props for its time-conscious 
consensus to dissolve the co-op debt, 
calling it the “most efficient decision 
this council has made.”

since these services are typically the 
first to be cut. 

The university’s protocol for 
dealing with state budget cuts, how-
ever,   is to subtract from its three 
funding sources — general state 
funds, education fees and registra-
tion fees — to limit the impact on 
any one source.

“Our campus looks at all three 
funding sources as one pool of funds,” 
Bournoutian said. “It’s hard [to pro-
tect student services from these cuts] 
because everything is an advisory to 
[Chancellor Marye Anne Fox]. But 
the key is to get students to see what 
the impact is and convey that to the 
chancellor.”

Bournoutian said student input 
— through the 11 student represen-
tatives on the committee — is crucial 
to funding prioritization, in order to 
ensure the least damage to programs 
and events students value the most.

“At least the ones that are at the 
lower tier, that — if push comes to 
shove and we need to lose it for a cou-
ple years — it won’t be catastrophic,” 
he said. “It won’t be something that 
students depend on day to day.” 

The committee’s report will be 
finalized in the next two or three 
weeks, and will include recommen-
dations under three scenarios: 5 per-
cent, 10 percent and 15 percent cuts. 
The severity of the cuts, which would 

occur in July, will be determined 
when the university receives its final-
ized operating budget in the coming 
months.

“If the number is big, we might 
have to reorganize Student Affairs,” 
Assistant Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Ed Spriggs said. “Make it 
more centralized, because right now 

there’s not a lot of bureaucracy. It’s 
not vertical and very spread out.”

Spriggs cited the overlapping 
Administrative Services and Student 
Affairs departments in each of the 
campus’ six colleges as a possible area 
of consolidation. 

He said there have already been 
hiring freezes and caps on executive 
salaries. 

“The major budget reduction is 

hitting all areas of campus, and the 
reg fees are a part of it,” Spriggs said. 
“We have to put the perspective of 
cutting from one department against 
all other priorities.” 

The looming 10 percent reduction 
from registration-fee funds would 
follow a 5 percent cut to the Student 
Affairs Office from last December.

“The department was able to 
absorb [the 5 percent cut], but we lost 
wiggle room and flexibility for future 
reductions,” Spriggs said.

He added that the department 
“never really recovered” from shaving 
$5 million off its 2003-04 budget.

“There’s no area where we’ve got 
any fat,” he said.

The Campus Budget Office will 
ultimately decide the allocation of 
funds from registration fee cuts after 
the university’s operational budget 
is finalized, likely focusing on main-
taining the university’s academic 
function.

“No decisions have been made 
yet, but we’re trying to determine how 
to best manage expected state-bud-
get reductions to mitigate our core 
instructional mission,” said Sylvia 
Lepe-Askari, assistant vice chancel-
lor of the campus budget office. “The 
campus has to fund state reductions 
with general funds.”

As the increasingly unpopular UC Board of Regents prepares to meet next month right here 
at UCSD, there will be plenty of items 
to consider — specifically, all things 
related to money, because the uni-
versity, frankly, doesn’t ever seem to 
have enough, except to fill the already 
bloated pockets of its administrators.

Faced with dwindling state sup-
port and rising operating costs, the 
regents look certain to raise student 
fees by nearly 10 percent next year in 
an effort to maintain services.

But student fees aside, regents will 
also be considering a plan developed by 
UC President Mark G. Yudof outlining 
unpaid leave-of-absence procedures for 
employees systemwide. Meant to serve 
as a legal framework allowing cam-
puses to determine their own furlough 
protocols, the plan in effect will just end 
up screwing over another vulnerable 
group: UC workers. 

After allegedly freezing the sala-
ries of 300 top executives earlier this 
year and enacting a hiring freeze 
(measures the university itself has 

already broken by hiring two new 
executives and offering a hefty pre-
emptive retention pay increase to 
another exec), administrators are 
now counting on workers to bear 
the brunt of its funding shortage. 
In effect, Yudof is leaving the door 
wide open for employees to be sent 
home on unpaid leaves in an effort 
to conserve cash — employees who 
barely make ends meet now and who 
remain underpaid (if we speak in 
terms of market competitiveness, jar-
gon the university loves throwing 

around) despite recent contractual 
agreements to the contrary.

The answer to the university’s 
funding shortage should not be to 
shove this expense onto the backs 
of workers and students. The only 
way to solve this problem is with 
policies that target the university’s 
administrative salaries. If the regents 
were serious about its commitment to 
serving these groups, they would end 
executive pay hikes, not raise student 
fees and impose mandatory worker 
furloughs. 

Hey A.S. Council, good job!At last night’s meeting, councilmembers voted to 
overwhelmingly approve a $35,408.37 
allocation to UCSD’s four student-
run co-ops. The funding — which 
was taken from the council’s mandate 
reserves — will cover co-op debt 
owed to the council, accrued years 
ago during their controversial master 
space agreement negotiations with 
the university. This much-needed 
support comes from a council that 
has remained largely uninvolved in 
the co-ops’ treacherous dealings with 
the university. 

The Che Cafe, Groundwork 
Books, the General Store Co-op and 
the Food Co-op are student-run non-
profits, providing an array of valuable 
resources to students. As part of their 
self-sustaining, campus-improve-
ment mission, the co-ops value lower 
prices over profit and funnel any 
revenue back into the Student Center 
community by hosting events and 
improving their in-shop lounge spac-
es for students. Because of this ideol-
ogy, making up a years-old $35,000 
debt (the validity of which is pretty 
nebulous) would pose a devastating 
and unrealistic burden.  

Absorbing this debt by dipping 
into mandate reserves is a pragmat-
ic solution to the unfair position in 
which current co-oppers have been 
placed, and councilmembers should 
be applauded for their reasonable and 
swift action. By not using money from 
the student organizations unallocat-
ed fund, as was originally proposed, 
councilmembers shielded the rest of 

the student body from any impact 
this might have had on student org 
funding. Instead, the council exhibited 
sophisticated discretion, choosing to 
redirect money from its reserves to 
finally put this mess to rest.

The co-ops are an excellent 
resource — and not just for the 
Student Center community and the 
hundreds of undergraduates, grad 
students, staff and faculty who visit 
them daily. Sure, Groundwork’s cheap 
books, the Food Co-op’s cheap and 
healthy lunch options, the General 
Store’s awesome lounge (complete 
with old-school arcade games) and 
the Che’s all-age concerts are awe-
some, but you don’t have to visit the 
co-ops to benefit from their presence 

here at UCSD. As completely student-
run entities, the co-ops provide an 
essential contrast to Price Center’s 
corporate aura, while advocating for 
student rights and providing a free-
spirited, progressive-minded campus 
niche for students. 

But it wasn’t just this edito-
rial board that took notice of the 
council’s resourcefulness: “That was 
probably the most efficient deci-
sion we’ve made all year,” outgoing 
A.S. President Donna Bean said as 
she thanked the council for coming 
together to address this issue.

Councilmembers deserve praise 
for the careful but prompt way they 
handled this request, and we’re 
ecstatic to see both effective gover-

nance and respect and support for 
these crucial campus entities.

STUDENT LIFE — Living on cam-
pus at UCSD means being held to 
legalistic policies in need of revi-
sion, as implemented by residence 
life offices that are sorely out 
of touch with the student body. 
Residence life offices must address 
this by working harder to publicize 
students’ rights when it comes to 
substance abuse violations.

Given the fact that UCSD is a 
public institution that’s responsi-
ble for enforcing California state 
law, it shouldn’t come as a surprise 
that alcohol consumption by those 
under 21 years of age is frowned 
upon — in fact, the clause outlining 
the prohibition of alcohol in univer-
sity housing is one of the garbled 

code’s clearest statements. 
Resident deans from five of the 

six colleges (Warren Resident Dean 
Claire Palmer was unavailable for 
comment) said they believe the 
current nonacademic misconduct 
process (the write-up process) to 
be more educational than puni-
tive. But based on the most recent 
Undergraduate Student Experience 
and Satisfaction committee report 
(published in September 2005 to 
outline everything students think is 
wrong with the university) and cur-
rent collective student sentiment, 
that’s really not the case. 

The U.S.E.S. report highlights 
students’ issues with residential 
security officers — they inspire fear 
in students and their duty should 
be to assure safety, not to police 
dorms. Resident deans from John 
Muir, Eleanor Roosevelt, Roger 
Revelle and Sixth Colleges agree 
with the latter sentiment — but 
they also don’t see any issues with 
the way RSOs currently do their 
jobs, despite the plain evidence that 
students do.

Each of the resident deans also 

said their offices ensure that stu-
dents know how they can respond 
to write-ups. While Revelle College 
Resident Dean Malik Ishmael went 
so far as to say he doesn’t know 
what more the university could pos-
sibly do to inform students of their 
rights, Pat Danylyshyn-Adams, resi-
dent dean of Muir College, said she 
feels students probably aren’t aware 
of certain steps they can take in 
their own defense — such as filing 
complaints against RSOs. She also 
said the administration needs to 
evaluate its outreach and clarity for 
students’ sake.

Frank Carroll, A.S. associate vice 
president of student advocacy, for 
one, is doing his part to reach out to 
students. His office is beginning a 
Know Your Rights campaign regard-
ing substance abuse and RSOs lead-
ing up to the Sun God Festival, 
though Carroll said future cam-
paigns, perhaps during Welcome 
Week, will focus more on residence 
life. He said one of the chief con-
cerns of his office involves RSOs’ 
violation of the Fourth Amendment 
(for the less legalistically inclined, 

the fundamental American right 
preventing unlawful searches and 
seizures). Students aren’t obligated 
to allow RSOs entry into their living 
area, but currently RSOs have the 
power to forcibly enter any living 
area under the guise of a “health and 
safety check.”

If residence life offices really 
were doing their very best job of 
informing students, these efforts 
would be superfluous.

When a student is found in pos-
session of, say, a “party ball” (the 
conduct code doesn’t explicitly state 
what exactly one of these is, but 
from context we can deduce that it’s 
some kind of container with a lot of 
alcohol), seldom is he aware of what 
kinds of repercussions will follow. 
The write-up process he faces can 
by turns be confusing, intimidating 
or painstakingly slow. 

The residence life offices don’t 
contact the student with any infor-
mation during the weeks that pass 
between the write-up and the next 
step — an e-mail parcel notification,

Look, I love books. Absolutely love ’em all. As a sophomore, I rejected all hope of future pros-
perity by trading in my human biology 
major for literatures in English. And, as 
the zeitgeist would have it, I’ll be doing 
that reading not on pages, but on an 
electronic screen. 

But don’t start lamenting the end 
of civilization, or the inevitable world 
electronics industry domination just 
yet. Revolutionary technologies have 
already changed the way we listen 
to music, communicate and access 
information. Come on, our parents 
were sure the freaking Internet was 
going to phase out all human com-
munication until they started using 
Urbandictionary.com to figure out 
what the hell we were talking about. 
It’s not so surprising that some techies 
have decided it’s time we stopped 
cutting down trees in the interest of 
looking cool while reading “War and 
Peace” on the shuttle. 

Remember when portable mp3 
players first showed up? Everyone 
thought the music industry was crazy 
to believe we would pay for, or even 
to need access, thousands of songs 
at any given moment. A few years 
and billions of iTunes downloads later, 
having your music collection at your 
fingertips has become the norm, not 
the exception. 

Now I, more than most people, 
understand that the pleasure of curl-
ing up with a page-turner could never 
(or at least not soon) be duplicated by 
an electronic screen. It doesn’t have 
that musty book smell; you won’t 
remember the time you picked it out 
at Pennywise Books with your literary-
minded ex; you won’t be able to mail it 
to your sister once you finish it. 

But, as college students, let’s be 
honest: The allure of paying under $5 
for Dostoevsky’s complete works, as I 
did last night for a Russian literature 
class using Amazon’s e-reader Kindle, 
is nearly irresistible. If I really love all 
600-odd pages of “The Idiot” and want 
it physically sitting on my bookshelf, I 
can overnight it. No big deal.

This isn’t the beginning of a devalu-
ation of the book — quite the opposite, 
in fact. I’ll feel much better dropping 
a couple hundred bucks on a rare or 
signed edition of a novel, because I’ll 
have extra cash available that I won’t 
have spent on paperbacks in the air-
port. The latest John Grisham thriller 
provides me with nothing more than 
an entertaining way to pass the time 
on the Amtrak to Los Angeles. On 
the other hand, a first-edition Jack 
Kerouac will, in my estimation, be 
worth holding on to — and I’m talking 
physically.

I’m not saying the Kindle is the 
be-all end-all of books as we know 
it. I’m just saying that something like 
it is going to be in everyone’s pocket 
on the subway in the not-too-distant 
future. Not only are e-readers portable, 
efficient and convenient, they also fit 
perfectly into the “green” mentality 
of the moment, which everyone from 
President Barack Obama to Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox is currently adopting

(see: Earth Week). 
Killing fewer trees definitely 

gets filed under “sustainability.” In 
fact, they might even build a mon-
ument to the Kindle at our new 
Sustainability Center. 

And at a time when newspa-
pers and publishing companies are 
either collapsing like condemned 
buildings or cutting staff like it’s 
the apocalypse, Kindle and the like 
can achieve the impossible: increase 
both access to written works and 
American reading levels. 

Digression: We, as a culture, are 
lazy. If you want to debate this, 

we can talk about it in the car at 
the nearest drive-thru restaurant, as 
long as we stop at the B-of-A ATM 
on our way. And after our conversa-
tion, I’m sure we’ll both need a drink 
or two, which we can pick up at the 
drive-thru liquor store. 

But I get it — you’d rather not go to 
the library and hear 5-year-olds whin-
ing about borrowing the latest Disney 
installment. Plus, the Fashion Valley 
Barnes & Noble employees are creepy, 
and don’t even get me started on Geisel 
Library. I feel for you. 

But get this: Kindle loads reading 
material, ranging from classic novels 
to newspapers,  in seconds. To you. 

At your exact location. To a flat device 
the (exact) size of an unopened DVD 
case that weighs only around twice as 
much as a double-double burger, even 
animal-style.

Unfortunately, like most new tech-
nologies, e-readers currently come 
with a hefty price tag. Not only will the 
Kindle set you back a few hundred, but 
new releases often clock in at around 
$10. Considering that you’re paying for 
a digital copy that can’t even be trans-
ferred, much less resold after you read 
it, that seems a little steep. Here’s my 
idea: Steal the T-Mobile MyFaves plan

in which case the parcel is actu-
ally the student’s misconduct report. 
Such reports include a description 
of what the RSO who caught Johnny 
Keg-lover observed. 

But before the individual report 
is delivered to Johnny, he knows 
nothing of the kinds of charges he 
stands to face, or the consequences 
of those charges. 

In fact, once the report is deliv-
ered, accompa-
nied by a brochure 
called “Essential 
I n f o r m a t i o n 
Pertaining to 
an Allegation of 
N o n - A c a d e m i c 
M i s c o n d u c t ,” 
Johnny’s only 
made aware of 
a list of possible 
outcomes of his 
alleged miscon-
duct, ranging from 
a warning to sus-
pension; but there’s no specification 
whatsoever of which outcome might 
fit his crime.

In order for the write-up pro-
cess to actually be educational in 
practice, residence life offices must 
do just that: educate. Freshmen are 
likely to be confused by the legalistic 
language of the Student Conduct 
Code; resident deans should post 
clear, user-friendly descriptions of 
the write-up process in individual 
freshman suites each year; that way, 
there would be a clear, omnipresent 
reminder of what exactly students 
can expect if they’re unfortunate 
enough to be written up. Residence 
life offices could also instruct the 
RAs to hold quarterly suite meetings 
explaining this very process, and the 
rights that students have throughout 
each of its stages. 

Students must be made aware that 
they’re not required to allow RSOs 
access to their room or suite, and 
that the best move is typically to step 
outside with an RSO to civilly discuss 
whatever the issue appears to be.

Realistically, when an RSO 
announces his presence, students 
are going to be intimidated — which 
is why it’s so important that they 
know how the process works before 
that knock on the door even occurs. 

Other, even small-
er steps, such as 
composing a stan-
dard e-mail to send 
to accused stu-
dents rather than 
a preposterous 
parcel notification, 
would increase the 
transparency of the 
write-up process. 
Small steps like 
these to optimize 
transparency could 
go a long way in 

improving student attitudes toward 
this disciplinary — sorry, “educa-
tional” — process. And being that 
the goal of the whole nonacademic 
misconduct process is education, 
it seems only fair for residence life 
offices to fully inform students.

An as-yet unnamed committee, 
under Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Penny Rue, will soon be 
entirely rewriting the Student 
Conduct Code to increase its clar-
ity and accessibility over the next 
18 months. 

But the efforts shouldn’t stop 
there — if this process is to become 
truly educational, residence life 
offices must do more to ensure that 
students know their rights.

Dear Editor,

As a proud graduate of UCSD 
(class of 2008), and a current M.Ed 
student at this school, I was not able 
to vote in the recent A.S. election, 
and I wanted a chance to be heard. 
I understand from my undergradu-
ate roommates that there is a move-
ment afoot to start an undergraduate 
football team at UCSD, with possible 
funding coming from the undergrad-
uate pocketbook. I write to express my 
disapproval of such an idea at UCSD.

We have always been a rigorous 
academic school, with little time for 
such extravagant sports as football. We 
have very good sports teams (water 
polo, soccer) that make better use of 
our time and money than the money-
sink that is a college football program. 
In addition, many UCSD students are 
quite proud of the reputation we have 
in the city and the state for being 
focused on the more important things 
in life. We look down on schools like 
San Diego State University for valuing 
sports and fraternities over academic 
rigor and action in the world. To add a 
football team to UCSD would cheapen 
our image and put unnecessary finan-
cial strain on the undergraduates.

If, after demanding a hefty ath-
letics referendum two years ago, the 
athletics program has extra money to 
spend, let it be put back into things 
that really matter at the school. Let 
us improve the sports that are already 
thriving and respected at UCSD. Let 

us make the campus more sustain-
able, and offer better services to the 
students who are paying so much 
for them. Better yet, give the money 
back to the undergraduates, many of 
whom struggle through school work-
ing two jobs to make ends meet in this 
economy. Make more scholarships for 
groups who are underrepresented in 
the UCSD student population. Put 
money back into the tutoring and 
outreach programs that have been cut 
over the last several years. 

In short, I urge you, the A.S. 
Council, and the whole school to find 
something better to do with our time, 
our money and our reputation than to 
throw it into expensive uniforms and 
stadiums. Thank you for your time 
and your effort in serving UCSD.

— Bonnie Wagner
Graduate Student

Dear Editor,
I’m writing to address a docu-

ment titled, “The UC Budget: Myths 
& Facts,” recently posted on the UC 
Office of the President’s Web site.

Many of the misstatements in 
that document are things that I have 
pointed out before in my writing and 
speaking to top officials of this uni-
versity, though my critiques have been 
ignored. Here are the worst examples:

The fact sheet said, “UC’s budget 
is made up of many different fund 
sources, but most of them are restrict-
ed to specific uses and cannot be used 

for other purposes.”
In the latest budget, one reads of 

$5.4 billion in “core funds,” which 
are defined as general funds plus 
student fees. But we see that this 
accounts for only 39 percent of all 
unrestricted funds spent by the uni-
versity last year! 

It also said, “A payment for a 
surgery in a UC hospital can’t be 
redirected to fund graduate students.” 
That is a half-truth. There is a sur-
plus income from the UC medical 
enterprises, amounting to around $1 
billion a year, which is distributed 
to faculty in the medical schools as 
“bonus pay.” A portion of that money 
could be redirected to other press-
ing academic needs in these times 
of budget stringency: That would 
be called shared sacrifice. Mark G. 
Yudof and the regents have authority 
to implement such a strategy. 

The sheet also denied that salaries 
being given to UC senior managers 
affected the increase in student fees, 
because management salaries repre-
sent less than 1 percent of the total 
payroll at the UC system.

In previous papers, I have demon-
strated that there is a much larger con-
stellation of management bureaucracy 
throughout the UC system, which has 
grown over the past decade and is now 
estimated to waste some $600 mil-
lion per year. The Senior Management 
Group, which is discussed here, is just 
the tip of that iceberg. 

They said the primary reason stu-
dent fees rise is related to the decline 
in the state’s funding for per-student 
education at the UC system. 

What the university calls the 
“funding for per-student education 
at UC” is a piece of accounting fraud. 
The numbers used to calculate that 
actually cover all of the costs for facul-
ty research work throughout the aca-
demic year as well as undergraduate 
plus graduate educational programs. 

When I disaggregate that bundle of 
expenses, it turns out that undergrad-
uate student fees now cover the full 
per-student cost for the UC system to 
provide undergraduate education. So 
the reduction in state funding is really 
a cutback in the faculty’s research pro-
gram. That is a lamentable loss, but it 
is totally unjustified to dump that cost 
onto undergraduate students. These 
same facts also eradicate the justifica-
tion for Yudof ’s claim that the state has 
failed to provide funds for “enrollment 
growth,” since the student fees cover 
all of that cost.

and let readers share e-books they’ve 
downloaded with their closest fam-
ily and friends. That means everyone 
will want their own e-reader once its 
price drops, and siblings won’t try and 
kill one another when the next Harry 
Potter-esque series arrives. 

If the price isn’t a problem, but 
you’re not into Kindle’s paperback 
novel-size screen, another option 
beckons. A company called Plastic 
Logic has invented something just 
for newspaper readers, though it 
functions with all the same reading 
material as smaller screen e-readers. 
Instead of a relatively thick, unbend-
able screen, the company has intro-
duced a printer-paper-sized sheet of 
plastic that is larger, yet still portable.

Also, in a statement that makes me 
want to purchase the e-reader the sec-
ond it comes out, the company claims 
the nifty device is strong enough to 
withstand “getting hit by a shoe.” 

Hello, other companies? I want 
everything described in these terms. 
What, exactly, can I hit your product 
with before it breaks?

Regardless of whether you think 
the e-readers currently available are 
the answer, the question of the future 
of printing needs to be addressed. 
Barnes & Noble won’t do itself, or us, 
any good by burying its head in the 
sand; neither will Hearst Newspapers. 
If this means adopting the e-reader 
business model and selling their own 
tailored versions, they better get on it 
and adapt — or risk being left behind.

In the meantime, I’ll be snuggled 
up on my couch with this morning’s 
Times, last week’s Economist and the 
final chapters of “The Idiot” — all 
for less than last month’s cable bill. 
The Kindle even saves my page for 
me. Score.

lors, president and academic senates 
be defined to accurately determine the 
necessity and extent of furloughs and 
salary reductions at each campus.

Factors to be considered would 
include the maintenance of medical 
center operations, the costs of preserv-
ing public safety, honoring existing 
union contracts and following govern-
mental regulations.

“Only when we have in place these 
decision-making processes should we 
move forward with the actions neces-
sary to respond to our changing fiscal 
situation,” Yudof said.

The proposal follows the regents’ 
decision earlier this year to freeze the 
salaries of 300 top UC executives after 
the state cut $115 million in funding 
from the UC system. UC officials proj-
ect that the deficit will climb to $450 
million within the next two years due 
to the rising operational costs. 

According to Julian Posadas, exec-
utive vice president of the American 
Federation of State, County and 
Municipal Employees Local 3299, 
which represents service workers uni-
versitywide, top university executives 
have compromised little compared to 
union workers, who — despite their 
recent contract renewals — are still 
paid below the state average.

“We hear cuts, but these cuts do 
not affect high executives and the UC 
Office of the President,” Posadas said. 

“We feel the cuts need to come from 
where there is a budget, but we don’t 
hear talk about [Yudof ’s] salary being 
frozen or any cuts about his wages 
being cut at all.”

Posadas added that Yudof has not 
considered that any cuts to under-
represented worker salaries or the pos-
sibility of mandatory furloughs to all 
workers would compromise the com-
munal aspect of the university.

“It’s going to affect the campus 
community because we won’t be able 
to provide quality work to faculty and 
staff,” he said. “We don’t see President 
Yudof addressing real issues, like how 
students and communities will be 
affected by these furloughs and layoffs.” 

Currently, the university’s payroll, 
which includes over 170,000 full-
time and part-time faculty and staff, 
amounts to roughly $9 billion annually 
— not including medical and retire-
ment benefits. 

Although roughly 60,000 (35 per-
cent) of those employees are protected 
by labor contracts that cannot be mod-
ified without union approval, the uni-
versity still has the authority to imple-
ment furloughs and layoffs on these 
workers. Yudof concedes that while 
UC employees are an indispensable 
part of the university, budgetary woes 
can no longer sustain previous UC 
spending, making cuts to employee 
salaries necessary. 

“As we confront all of these finan-

cial challenges, we must acknowledge 
that the university’s greatest asset — 
its human capital — comprises a sig-
nificant amount of its budget,” he said. 
“More than 70 percent of our core bud-
get is devoted to faculty and employee 
salary and benefits.”

According to UC spokesman Paul 
Schwartz, further analysis will deter-
mine which employees will be impact-
ed by the cuts. He added that Yudof ’s 
plan is not definite and represents one 
possible option for the university.

“[We] shouldn’t assume it’s going to 
happen — it may not, but the president 
wants to be prepared in case we think 
we need to move in this direction,” 
Schwartz said. “It certainly would be 
looked upon as a last resort, as we’re 
undertaking a broad range of measure-
ments to try to cope with the state 
funding shortfall.”

Posadas said workers are prepared 
to fight against any threats of salary 
cuts or furloughs, should the plan be 
favored by the regents next month.

“I think that our workers — low-
wage workers and any other workers 
on campus, particularly those that don’t 
have contracts, like clerical workers and 
thousands of technical workers — need 
to know that we do have a voice and 
we will be stepping up and holding UC 
accountable,” Posadas said.

the campus.” 
She encouraged parents to speak 

with students about marijuana use and 
their plans for April 20.

“We don’t like that our campus 
attracts people whose only reason for 
being here is to participate in an illegal 
activity,” Burns said. “It really doesn’t 

portray a positive image of the uni-
versity.”  

Last year, campus police turned 
away 50 cars from Porter Meadow and 
issued 100 parking tickets. Burns said 
the university will continue curbing 
4/20 activities in coming years.

Nevertheless, UCSC junior Diana 
Avenado said the use of marijuana is 

a “fairly harmless” Santa Cruz pastime 
that will not disappear any time soon.

“I don’t think parking restrictions 
and barricades will really do much,” 
she said. “They didn’t seem to last 
year.”

AR TS�ENTER TA INMENT

A Fresh-Penned CropALL TOGETHER NOW: KISS, 
MAKE UP AND 
LOVE THE LOFT
W e at the Guardian spend a lot of time making enemies.Granted, much of the hate 
mail and evil eyes are fired out of mis-
interpretation: No, we do not hate the 
Grove, just its paternal neglect; Yes, 
we understand the Koala must cater 
to a horny, immature demographic, 
just selfishly wish it would cater to us 
instead; No, we do not want the A.S. 
candidates to die a slow, painful death, 
just hold them to a standard of legitima-

cy that should be demanded of anyone 
looking to take on that kind of respon-
sibility. And salary. And parking spot.

OK, so we also get wildly bitter up 
here, hacking away at an unread, dead-
broke rag on fucked-up computers that 
smell like Hi Thai. Especially when — 
thanks our hilarious newspaper neigh-
bors down the way — we can’t even 
get into the second-story bathroom, 
three hours and pussy-ass Rockstars 
past deadline. Thus, oftentimes taking 
the critic’s cap a little — way — too 
seriously.

Case in point: the Loft. I personally 
have developed a sinister, death-wish-
ing undersneer throughout previews 
for concerts at the Loft that trap-doors 
every complement I do manage to 
squeak out. Too sterile. Corporate 
decor. Cafeteria seating. Over-eclectic 
(yikes — that must have been a long 
night). Since basically every concert 
worth previewing is held at the Loft 
now, I’m of course even more bitter 
about having to cater to a single venue, 
and do everything within my name-
calling powers to avoid becoming your 
everyday brochure-blurb noodle.

Which essentially makes me no 
better than a 2-year-old who wants her 
teddy bear to be missing an eye before 
she’s bothered to drag it along the 
sidewalk a block or two. It’s right time 
I Frisbeed some long-deserved props 
to that ArtPower!-born venue-ling 
down in the scary airport part of Price 
Center. Because I mean, compared to 
those old Mandeville quintet snores, 
this shit is ebonics.

And what I mean to say is: Sorry, 
Loft. I fucking love you.

Wow. So seeing as I’m being so gosh-
darn mature all of a sudden, I’d like to 
ask the same of the other butt of my 
almost-fifth-year fury: the A.S. Council, 
and specifically A.S. Programming 
(soon to be known as A.S. Concerts 
and Events, praise be Allah).

As long as I’m sucking enemy toes 
here, I should say that Garrett Berg 
and the gang really stepped up to the 
Sun God plate this year. We may not 
get day stages and uncontested slip ’n’ 
slides just yet — savin’ all that for 2010, 
right, Gupta? — but N.E.R.D. and Girl 
Talk? The Cool Kids? Holy shit. This 
is good. Not just good in the way T.I. 
and Third Eye Blind were good — like, 
pop some E and revel in nostalgia 
and ridiculousness good — but creepy 
good, like I might even have less fun 
because I’m hushing the debauchery 
to listen good. (Do note, however, that 
I haven’t mentioned Iron and Wine.)

MFA PLAYWRIGHTS SHOW OFF TWO WEEKS’ WORTH OF CRISP AND SATIATING INK 

In a whirl of imaginative performances over a two-week span, the Baldwin 
New Play Festival is a purely student-run production. The on-campus 
series features full-length plays and staged readings from students in the 
MFA Playwriting Program, a synergistic effort of the entire UCSD Theatre 
and Dance Department.  

During the week leading up to showtime, the student playwrights 
and directors were caught in a final frenzy of production meetings 
and rehearsals. They come from all disciplines — from neuroscience to 
engineering and classical singing — but what unites them is a mutual 
appreciation for the visceral gusto of live theater. As “Clementine” 
playwright Krista Knight puts it: “When something is cool onstage it hits 
you in the gut. I don’t get that very often when I go to the movies. I don’t 
get that very often when I go to the theater, but when I do? Man. When 
it’s good, it’s good.”

“Refraction”
DIRECTED BY JEFF WIENCKOWSKI

WRITTEN BY RONALD MCCANTS

A long way from “Trollmole,” the 20-pager he wrote in first grade, engineering major Ronald McCant’s “Refraction” unravels the more serious yarns of sexuality and racial relations.  
The tale begins after the death of a homosexual black youth at the hands of 

Rico, a Latino teenager. Compelled to reveal Rico’s murderous motives, a counselor 
at the Texas Youth Commission tries drawing it out of him with therapy, and in 
this grueling process, uncovers the besmirched past and violence of his own family.  

“I tried to be inspired by what is American, what is ours,” McCant said, gestur-
ing charismatically. “And I think what is ours is our family structures, our way of 
life, and our communities — which are extensions of our families.”  

His own family history, in fact, provided him with a scaffold of inspiration, 
both for the new play and his playwriting career from the get-go. “My focus is 
storytelling,” he said. “I grew up in a household where that’s what we’d do — tell 
stories all the time.”  

McCant also infuses a passion for engineering into his theatrics. Amid produc-
ing children’s television shows, teaching at high schools and interning, he maintains 
an engineer’s mechanistic outlook: “I love technology, and I’m trying to bridge 
a gap between technology and storytelling,” he said. One of his many pastimes, 
working on his Web site Bettyit.com, explores the Internet as a storytelling vehicle.  

Still, McCant finds that the power to “milk a metaphor” can’t be found outside 
the theater. “I see it best as a place for healing, a place to observe things like a 
scientist. ... If the theater was just for theater people, then what good would it be?”  

 “Refraction” will be performed live at the Mandell Weiss Forum Studio on 
April 16, 17, 22, 23 and 24 at 8 p.m.

“Obscura”
DIRECTED BY TOM DUGDALE
WRITTEN BY JENNIFER BARCLAY

H er espresso’s getting cold. But the everyday scattering of cigarette butts and chatter of passersby have always been enough to fuel Jennifer Barclay.
“Obscura,” the grad student’s latest play, channels transatlantic voyeur-

ism — the stuff of indulgent Parisian cafe-goers — into a poetic and unlikely 
romance between two neighbors sharing an insomniac apartment build-
ing. Sure, the quaint of cobblestone pavements along the Champs-Elysées 
soon yield to the uncomfortable grubbiness of everyday life, but Barclay’s 
enchanting fairytale retains the dreaminess of a land far, far away. 

“I’ve lived in a lot of apartments,” Barclay said, resting her head in her 
palm. “And I was very fascinated by the duplicity between how intimate it is 
and how alien it is to live smack up right next to somebody.” In fact, just the 
other night, a neighbor’s food scraps funneled up through her sink. 

It’s within the collaboration and artistic vision of director Tom Dugdale 
that “Obscura’’ will rightly project itself onto the set, as a voyeuristic con-
sciousness of less than polite personal habits. 

During dress rehearsal, actors parade onto the stage through the aisles — 
the distance between makeshift apartment and audience instantly vanishing 
— while natural lighting dispenses the room.The play is a three-ring circus, 
challenging our ability to follow multiple events as they unfold simultane-
ously. 

“It’s like watching four different televisions at once,” Dugdale explained. 
“We see all the apartments all the time. There are no blackouts. Everything 
continues.” 

Barclay said she was inspired to become a playwright after experiencing 
the “complete transportation” and suspension of disbelief that theatrical 
performance can provide its audience. “Where you come out of a play, 
and you feel your head is just spinning and you’re just reeling, and you 
feel like you’ve been to a completely different universe,” she said, “and you 
somehow, even if it’s in an inarticulate way, feel like you’ve been changed.”  

“Obscura” will be performed live at the Mandell Weiss Forum Theater on 
April 17, 18, 24 and 25 at 8 p.m. 

K rista Knight is never short of words — they adorn her hands like temporary tattoos, decorate her fridge and animate the to-do list of her personalized Google start page. 
“It’s like I’m expecting to be called up for script duty at any minute and need to 

be armed with play ideas at the ready,” Knight says. 
In a testament to her fascination with language, “Clementine and the Cyber 

Ducks” dabbles with the lyrics of its namesake. Revamping the practically canon-
ized western folk ballad, “Clementine” welds the mid-1800s gold rush with 1990s 
Silicon Valley. But despite its dark examination of the American frontier’s transfor-
mation, the play maintains a buoyant spirit — in the frivolity of its bar fights, loose 
women and steam-punk chorus of deviant ducks. 

Main character Brian, a young computer programmer, opens the play with a 
recount of last night’s bar-scapade: He met a girl, Clementine — straight from 1849. 
With her crippled father in tow, Clementine has traveled out west to strike it rich, 
only to discover it a contemporary dot-com bubble. The ensuing romance between 
Brian and Clementine careens into a modern day, get-rich-quick scheme: to start 
up an Internet search engine. But to fund the operation, Clementine and Brian get 
into the bad habit of wrenching money from the helpless geezer.  

In this vaudevillian Greek tragedy, the juxtaposition of time periods hints more 
profoundly at the similarities that interested its playwright from the start. 

“The song ‘Clementine’ has always struck me because of the disparity between 
this upbeat melody and the song’s internal narrative about this girl’s drowning,” 
Knight said. 

And it’s this kind of unexpected cohesion that defines Krista’s playwriting career. 
As an undergraduate at Brown University, she studied neuroscience, motivated by 
the “precise ways of describing the known world.” When asked about leaping across 
disciplines, she says, with the sophistication of a well-versed playwright, “What 
drew me to playwriting was the opportunity to use those same parameters, to create 
unique worlds. Every time I create a play, I create a world.”

“Clementine and the Cyber Ducks” will be performed live at the Arthur Wagner 
Theater on April 17, 18, 24 and 25 at 8 p.m.

for greedy student orgs and funding 
oversights) wouldn’t pass, raining on 
the potential awesomeness of Berg’s 
Sun God before it could come to frui-
tion — the A.S. Council did something 
unforgivable. They didn’t let the Loft 
onto the referendum. Just in case, they 
defended, students wouldn’t want to 
shell out $3 without getting some sort 
of Loft oversight.

Like students know what oversight 
is. Or have any shadow of it concerning 
the other $2,800.

Meanwhile, A.S. Programming still 
uses the space for their own concerts — 
and great things happen. The No Age 
show was kick-ass, if kind of short, but it 
made one thing clear: We should all be 
in this together. Penny Rue was quoted 
as saying the university would never let 
the Loft die; however, that might mean 
chancellor brunches and “vine” tastings 
until we get all pruney and beg for finals 
week. If we want the Loft to continue 
as is, sticking with the “pay as you can” 
option, it’s time to throw down.

And paying as you can is really 
fucking crazy if you think about it. I’m 
paying $100 to go to Coachella this 
Friday when I could basically enjoy a 
free, week-long Coachella five minutes 
from my last class, any week of the 
year (albeit, sans Leonard Cohen. Then 
again, plus Jens Lekman).

So when the Loft crawls back for 
help from the new A.S. Council come 
inaugeration, there better be no fucking 
question in anybody’s mind. And that 
goes for you too, apathetic third-year. 
You should feel honored to shell out $3 
a quarter for the Loft.

Oh, and uh, shout-out to the Che 
Cafe. Don’t hate me. You’re next.

“Persepolis”

The animated diary of a spunky expatriate, “Persepolis” 
airs out all those childhood memories of the Islamic 
Revolution. Based on the French graphic novel that made 
creator Marjane Satrapi a New York Times bestseller and 
columnist, it follows the boom of religious fundamentalism in 
the ’80s through precocious eyes — before they were draped 
in floor-length veils, not long after the fall of Iran’s monarchy 
in the days of disco. (EG)

D odgeball” director Rawson Marshall Thurber has decided to 
throw audiences an earnest 
curveball in his latest com-
ing-of-age saga shadowing ’80s college grad 
Art Bechstein (Jon Foster) as he unclenches 
himself from his father’s professional-gangster 
grip — at least for the summer. Adapted 
from the 1988 novel by Pulitzer Prize win-
ner Michael Chabon, “The Mysteries of 
Pittsburgh” means well and warm, but ulti-
mately fails to conjure up any scrap of road-
trip romanticism.

The film opens to Bechstein’s voiceover — 
peeled from the novel’s glass-half-empty first 
pages — and Thurber doesn’t let cynicism 
reign too long. Before we know it, he’s traded 
what we thought would be a self-reflective 
memoir for formulaic melodrama.

Making a sparkly-eyed connection with 
Jane Bellwether (the coy and smiley Sienna 
Miller) at an ex-roommate’s pool party, 

Bechstein’s minimum-wage 
life story at the Book Barn is 
put on hold. 

He’s soon interrupted by 
Bellwether’s estranged yet jeal-
ous and coincidentally bisexu-
al boyfriend Cleveland Arning 
(Peter Sarsgaard), who kidnaps 

Bechstein and playfully throws him over the 
rails of an abandoned steel mill — all accom-
panied by stilted commentary. “It was there, 
sitting 300 feet above the ground staring at 
a lunatic, that my summer finally began,” 
rambles Bechstein.

Bechstein’s childlike, hesitant affection 
for Arning predictably evolves into homo-
erotic outings, chock full of life lessons. As 
Bellwether and Arning continue drifting apart, 
“Pittsburgh” strains at emotional complexity 
but lacks the characters to make it possible.

While Thurber does a tolerable job of craft-
ing a luminous visual tapestry — capturing a 
love triangle that traverses rural Pennsylvania 
on weekend getaways — he patches the lack of

Bat for Lashes
■ Two Suns
ASTRALWERKS

A lchemizing Fur and Gold into low-fi tech tricks and pealing instrumentation, Two Suns fans Brighton-based lead-singer Natasha Khan’s folk fire with mystical effect. 
Clearly, the Pakistani-born Brit has matured well beyond the 
hippie hymns she yowled over a spare set three years ago. 
The bones from her chilly debut are still there — hand-
claps, curling horns and chamber-music tribalism — just 
polished with a backup choir and crisp studio techniques. 

After reviving herself on “Glass” (“I will rise now/ And 
go about the city”), a pummel of drums runs through lay-
ers of lithe woodwinds and harpsichord, and Khan’s pitch 
wanes to porcelain. Instead of relying on a minimalist 
appeal as in 2006, she shifts between ethereal ornamenta-
tion and a somber tenor, pacing her vocals alongside the 
fluid tempo of “Siren’s Song” and the PJ Harvey melody of 
“Travelling Woman.”

It’s the same runway off which her Mercury-nominated 

style took flight, with new varnish to her woodsy mysti-
cism. But even after adding ornate textures to the walls 
of her moonlit shanty, Khan pells through to keep some 
of the Old World ocher. In fact, tracks like “Moon and 
Moon” are some of her shaman-songwriting bests, sub-
limating the animal oneness and PETA-friendly poetics 
on Fur and Gold for proverbial mythologies in the ghostly 
vein of Hopi storytelling. 

And yet, as Wordsworthian as she’d like us to believe 
she is, Khan’s still willing to throw in a postmodern tribute 
to “The Karate Kid” without us even noticing (“Daniel”). 
Melding outback affinities with her Gen-Y upbringings, 
Two Suns not only holds up the boho cords that caught 
our ears, but rubs in a spiritual salve.

The Thermals
■ Now We Can See
KILL ROCK STARS

T he Thermals are the most punk-ass kids you’ll ever meet. Or at least they think they are. These shamelessly self-promoting Pitchfork darlings (sanctimoniously 8.5 
out of 10) piss-marked their territory with The Body, The 
Blood, The Machine, a politicized “post-pop-punk classic” 
(in their own words) about a couple migrating to evangeli-
cal America. But the trio’s latest post-whatever foray, Now 
We Can See, is more mediocre than manifesto, its sunny 
turns cross-hatched with what they insist is “neo-grunge 
attitude.” 

You’ve got to wonder if maybe it’s all a joke. Their 
overtly flashy, too-indie-for-you Web site bio, the 
Pitchfork interview in which lead singer/guitarist Hutch 
Harris calls himself a “recovering Catholic,” the extended 
odes to drowning — it all reeks of attention-whoring. But 
with tracks whizzing by at three minutes or less, it’s hard 
to concentrate long enough to care. 

Lukewarm “We Were Sick” takes the same three-chord 

progressions and pounds them to lifelessness, as Harris 
attempts an impassioned Nirvana: “Never a cure/ Never a 
care/ Never a need.” But atop a head-bopping, all-togeth-
er-now chorus, it ends up more family patio than squawl-
ing basement. Their every-teen aura pervades “Now We 
Can See,” a weaksauce social commentary buzzing with 
liberal guilt. “Yeah baby we were nothing/ We existed for 
less!/ Our present was empty/ Our history a mess!” Harris 
shouts in emo strain. Ten seconds of guitar solo later, he’s 
still foreseeing nothing but blame. 

But really, what else would you expect? Sans lyrics and 
with the volume down, the Portland punks’ 11 blendable 
tracks thankfully register as background noise, sappy like 
the Strokes but without that sweet drawl — or much else 
— to distinguish them.

transitional queues in “Pittsburgh” 
with Power Point transitions. Bolded 
white letters pasted against a black 
background fade to find Bechstein 
at a restaurant with his gruff father 
(Nick Nolte).  

While the steel city of Pittsburgh 
certainly seems to take on a person-
ality of its own over the passing of 
seasons, Foster and Miller remain 
stale as the dusty Book Barn bargain 
shelf. Foster might’ve been crippled 
by Thurber’s decision to stay true to 
his novelistic inspiration (Bechstein’s 
passive-aggressive personality is 
difficult to portray on screen), but 

Miller — once typecast as the naive 
and sexually driven blonde, as in 
“Layer Cake” and “Alfie” — still man-
ages to strip more successfully than 
deliver dialogue. 

(If “Pittsburgh” has one redeem-
ing aspect, it’s undoubtedly Sarsgaard, 
who delivers a stunning performance 
as a teary-eyed roughrider right on 
cue.)

The film’s clumsy construction, 
masked by a saccharine narrative, 
leaves us wondering: What exactly 
was the mystery in the first place? 
Unfortunately,  we’d quicker get out 
of the parking lot than attempt to 
solve it.

Clumsy Narrative Wears Edges of Unlovable Triangle

Lady Sovereign
■ Jigsaw
MIDGET

N ever underestimate a loudmouthed British midget. Self-proclaimed shorty Lady Sovereign wasn’t called “Mighty Mouse” for nothing (by Jay-Z, no less). Her warrior-
woman ’tude counters her wee 5-foot-1-inch frame with a 
vengenance that Lily Allen’s virginal soprano never could. 

“Now, who are you/ To try to rule my world now?” Sov 
raps in “Bang Bang,” a territorial egofest that holds its own 
alongside some of hip-hop’s biggest prick anthems. And it is 
her world — from the elf-run record label all the way down 
to each gyrating pulse of bass and that somewhat eccentric 
personality.

Somewhat.
What begins as awesome techno-pop mashed with 

drunken rocker sass breaks off into a series of minor identity 
crises. Is she an educated hipster chick strutting downtown 

London, or the gritty back-alley rapper who’s getting all 
the shout-outs? Maybe she’s the downright disgusting self-
objectifier in syrup-choked “Food Play.”  

Not that it matters much. By “Bang Bang,” Sovereign’s 
back to trotting in the well-worn footsteps of Missy Elliot — 
“oi-oi-oi-pelloi” and that “bang bang” sound. 

By the time Jigsaw is halfway over, the undercooked inse-
curity in its title track and Sovereign’s attempts to be clever 
in — well, the entire album — are forgotten. But with bad-
ass beats and hooks catchy enough to be played on repeat 
Ess-Oh-Veeee delivers, and the delivery ain’t bad — just not 
quite sovereign.

vs. GRAND CANYON UNIVERSITYBaseball

of the game. With one out, junior 
catcher Kellen Lee started the Triton 
rally with a single that sparked the 
eight-hit inning. Tanner singled twice 
for UCSD, scoring once and driving 
in two runners, helping UCSD to an 
11-0 lead.

“Our offense can catch fire at any 
time,” Albitz said. “All it takes is one per-
son to get it going and the entire team 
joins in. That person has been Josh 
Tanner the last month. He has been 
the spark plug our team has needed 
since opening day. I don’t know where 
we’d be right now without his bat in the 
lineup and his glove at third base.”

Scoring in four of the final five 
innings, the Tritons plated a season-
high 20 runners, completing the feat in 
a seven-inning game.

The crooked numbers continued 
into the second game of the day as the 
Tritons put up a four-spot in the top 
of the first inning in what would be 
UCSD and Grand Canyon’s final game 
of the series. As the first four batters 
in the Triton lineup, Albitz, Imeson, 
Kehoe and Cantele all hit safely in the 
opening inning and contributed nine 
of UCSD’s 13 total hits in the game.

“We knew that if we did our job on 
offense, we would score runs and take 
some pressure off our pitching staff,” 
Kehoe said. “Our hitters did a great job 

of hitting barrel heads all weekend.”
The Tritons scored one run in each 

of the next two innings, giving them a 
6-0 advantage, leading to the 9-4 win. 

Seven Tritons hit for extra bases 
in the game, including Albitz, whose 
triple in the second inning was his first 
of the season. Winning pitcher senior 
Trevor Decker allowed one run over 
five innings for his fifth victory. 

The fourth game of the series, 
scheduled for April 12, was cancelled 
due to inclement weather.

With the sweep, UCSD (25-8, 
19-5 CCAA) remains in first place 
in conference with a three-game lead 
over Sonoma State University and Cal 
State Los Angeles. UCSD will now 
face fourth-place Cal State Dominguez 
Hills (25-16, 14-10 CCAA) for two 
games at home — where the Tritons 
have a 10-game winning streak — and 
two on the road.

“Cal State Dominguez Hills is going 
to be a solid CCAA team, much like 
the rest of our conference,” Imeson 
said. “As long as we stick to our game 
and attack their weaknesses we will 
have a good series. Playing at home is 
always great. Weather, supportive fans 
and a great field make us very happy 
to be home.”

“Laiah is running spectacularly,” 
women’s head coach Darcy Ahner said. 
“She’s an incredible competitor and she 
really knows how to stay focused.”

The UCSD 4x400-meter team also 
performed well, finishing seventh in 
a race that was won by a world-class 
team, which included two Olympic 
athletes. The relay team of Merrill, 
Skorupa, sophomore Deyna Roberson 
and junior Anna Lee McGregor earned 
an NCAA automatic qualifying time.

Sophomore Stephanie LeFever won 
the long jump, edging out sophomore 
Jasmine Pickett of Cal Poly San Luis 
Obispo to win with a mark of 5.71 
meters. The Tritons also had a third-
place finish from senior Sarah Hendy 
in the discus, whose mark of 160’11” 
was a personal best and second all-
time in school history. 

Sophomore Bre Schofield was the 
distance standout for the Tritons, as 
her time of 2:14.73 in the 800-meter 
run was good for ninth overall and was 
a NCAA provisional qualifying mark. 
Senior Ashleigh Montgomery finished 
10th in the same race, less than one 
second behind Schofield.

On the men’s side, senior Scott 
Tsuda won the long jump with a mark 
of 48’2”, only a half inch short of the 
school record he already owns. Junior 
Fred Cook also won for the Tritons 
in the hammer throw, with a per-
sonal best of 170’10”. The mark was the 
eighth best in UCSD history. 

Junior Casey Ryan, who set the 
record in the high jump last week, fin-
ished fifth in his event with a mark of 
6’8.75”. The high jump event was won 
by former Olympian James Nieto.

Salerno stressed the importance of 
facing elite competition in order for 
the team to achieve its full potential.

“It’s really critical and something 
we think is important to our program,” 
he said. “It’s an opportunity for us to 
redefine what we think we’re capable 
of. The term we use in coaching is 
‘taking the lid off,’ where athletes can 
see what else is out there and redefine 
what they think they can do.”

The Tritons compete again on 
April 18 at the Long Beach Invitational 
before coming home for the Triton 
Invitational on April 24.

the No. 1 spot, defeating senior Clint 
Walder 6-1, 6-0. Freshman Brandon 
Stevenson and sophomore Armaun 
Emami teamed up at the No. 2 dou-
bles spot for an 8-3 win. Sophomore 
Naveen Dixit and freshman Jake 
Fellow each won singles matches 6-0, 
6-0 completing the sweep.

Later that day, UCSD traveled to 
Denver to play Mesa State College. 
Once again, it was UCSD’s doubles 
teams that set the tone. At No. 1 
doubles, Negishi and Elliott defeated 
junior Jordan Chomko and junior 
Nick Provenza 8-5. The second and 
third doubles teams won their matches 
8-2, giving the Tritons a 3-0 lead.

UCSD continued its dominance in 
singles, dropping only one set over 
the six matches. Freshman William 
McCall had the most convincing win 
of the day, beating freshman William 
Kellar 6-0, 6-1. Dixit was the only one 
who had to battle, completing the clean 
sweep for UCSD with a hard-fought 
7-6, 3-6, 7-1 win over junior Rashad 
Khamis.

“We’ve got two matches left in the 
season, and we need to continue the 
momentum we were able to get in 
Colorado,” Negishi said. “With the 
way our team has been playing in 
practice, I expect that we can accom-
plish that and feel good about going 
into regionals.”

The Tritons are set to finish the reg-
ular season this week as they face two 
more matches on the road. On Friday 
afternoon they will head north to face 
Sonoma State University. The road trip 
will continue the next day with a tilt 
against UC Santa Cruz.

MEN’S CREW — If you ask any rower, 
they’ll tell you that spring is the most 
exciting time of the year. As one of few 
collegiate sports that athletes practice 
year round, fall season is dedicated to 
building rowers’ technical proficiency 
while improving strength and endur-
ance so that by the time spring rac-
ing season rolls around, athletes are 
primed — not to mention eager — to 
show their hard work and finally face 
their competitors.

In a sport where all battles take 
place on the water, spring races are 
the most important selection criteria 
for the post-season invitation rowing 
championships.  

Racing in the San Diego Crew 
Classic, held on April 4 and 5 at 
Mission Bay, the varsity eight boat 
stole the spotlight with a first-place 
finish in the grand final, capturing the 
Cal Cup.

“From day one in October of this 
season we focused on the big races in 
the spring, including the [San Diego] 
Crew Classic,” sophomore Justin 
Gordon said. “Our new training regi-
ment over the last six months prepared 
us to be very competitive this spring 
and it was validated with our win 
at Crew Classic. … Everyone wants 
the same thing, to win the [Western 
Intercollegiate Rowing Association 
Championships]. We trust that the 
other eight people in our boat are 
willing to put themselves through hell 
to achieve that. This year we have the 
potential to be the most successful 
crew UCSD has ever seen and that has 
been providing great motivation for 
the team.” 

Originally told that they weren’t 
competitive enough to be legiti-
mate challengers, the Tritons shat-
tered that judgment once they hit the 
water. Shadowing Sacramento State 
University during the first 500 meters, 

UCSD was able to draw even by the 
halfway point before it pulled away 
in the third quarter to coast to vic-
tory with a final time of 6:28.18. Left 
to follow in the Tritons’ wake were 
crosstown rival University of San 
Diego (6:31.04) in second, Orange 
Coast College (6:36.04) in third, Santa 
Clara University (6:36.75) in fourth 
and Sacramento State (6:37.16) in fifth. 
Bringing up the rear was UCLA with a 
time of 6:40.51.    

“One of the strong points on our 
team this year that really makes our 
boats move aggressively is the compet-
itiveness that we have within our own 

program,” senior co-captain Jonathan 
Lynch said. “In practice, each boat 
attempts to win everything from the 
warm-up to the cool down. We are 
never satisfied. Every piece, and every 
drill throughout practice, we always 
want to beat each other by more than 
the last time. Practicing with this men-
tality really allows us to come into race 
day mentally prepped for the challenge 
we have at hand.”

The winning varsity eight crew con-
sisted of junior Andrew Hilton, senior 
co-captain Ryan Andre, junior Jay Dee 
Morgan, senior Jeff Collett, sophomore 
Kris Grey, freshman Nathan Morgan, 
junior Karam Badran, Gordon and 
junior coxswain Cameran Biltucci.

Rewardingly, the varsity eight 

boat’s prevailing first place finish 
secures it a spot in next year’s presti-
gious Copley Cup. The Tritons, who 
appeared in the Copley Cup in 2008 
after a victory in the Cal Cup in 2007, 
were strangely not invited back to the 
event this year.

“From the beginning, we were in 
a shadow of doubt from the rowing 
community,” Gordon said. “Instead of 
being in the Copley Cup, we were 
in the Cal Cup and we were seeded 
behind crews we had already beaten 
earlier in the season. We attacked each 
race with the goal to prove to every-
one, including ourselves, that UCSD 
is a legitimate contender this year and 
we plan on doing very well. We basi-
cally wanted to make the Crew Classic 
committee check themselves and feel 
bashful for doubting us.” 

After the day’s results, it is unlikely 
that anyone will doubt the Tritons 
again this season. Equally impressive 
was UCSD’s junior varsity eight ‘A’ 
squad, who also seized a first-place 
finish competing in the petite final. 
Crossing the finish line at 6:28.70, 
the Tritons glided ahead of UC Davis 
(6:34.27), Santa Clara University 
(6:30.04), UCLA (6:40.27) and the 
University of Colorado (6:41.85). 

This weekend, the Tritons are back 
on the water as they take part in the 
44th annual regatta in Newport Beach. 
UCSD will then shoot for a sixth 
straight San Diego City Championship 
on April 19 at Mission Bay.  

“Given the results from our previ-
ous races with USD and OCC, we are 
expecting to do very well,” Gordon said. 
“This weekend we have the opportu-
nity to make a strong statement going 
into the last couple weeks of training 
before our conference championships. 
Hopefully we send out a clear message 
that we mean business and everyone 
else will be racing for second.”

TRACK & FIELD — As school records 
continue falling, the Tritons once again 
proved they have no problem going 
against tough competition.

The women’s 4x100-meter relay 
team set a university record and three 
athletes recorded wins in their events. 
The track and field team had a strong 
showing at the UCLA Rafer Johnson/
Jackie Joyner-Kersee Invitational from 
April 9 to April 11. The field included 
mostly Division-I programs and sev-
eral world-class athletes. 

“The team generally did really 
well,” men’s head coach Tony Salerno 
said. “We’re at the point where we can 
get on the track at a place like UCLA to 

compete and do very well.”
The women’s team was led by 

the 4x100 team, which consisted of 
junior Christine Merrill, senior Katie 
Skorupa, sophomore Kelly Fogarty and 
senior Laiah Blue. Their time of 46.75 
seconds was the fastest ever for UCSD 
and was also a NCAA provisional qual-
ifying performance. Blue had an excep-
tional meet all around, competing in 
the 100- and 400-meter hurdles and 
earning an NCAA automatic qualify-
ing time, as well as a provisional quali-
fying time, respectively. On Monday, 
Blue was named California Collegiate 
Athletic Association Women’s Track 
and Field Athlete of the Week for her 
performance.

TENNIS — The Tritons embarked on 
their longest excursion of the season, 
traveling to Colorado for three match-
es last weekend to push their record 
back to 10-10 overall. UCSD has had 
its share of struggles this season, but 
with a 4-2 record in its last six matches, 
the Tritons are finally beginning to hit 
their stride. With the regular season 
quickly coming to a close, head coach 
Eric Steidlmayer would like noth-
ing more than to see his team begin 
rounding into form.

“I’ve really been able to find a con-
sistent lineup that I can turn to, and 
that’s been the biggest key for our 
team’s success lately,” Steidlmayer said. 
“With regionals coming up, we need 
our team to be approaching its peak if 
we hope to compete with some of the 
best teams in our area.”

The Tritons began their road trip 
against Colorado Christian University 
in Lakewood, Colo., early Saturday 
morning, blowing out the Cougars 9-0. 
Many of Colorado Christian’s play-
ers were battling injuries as well as 
food poisoning, causing the team to 
default the third doubles and sixth 
singles matches to UCSD before they 
even started. Two other matches, the 
third and fifth singles, were completed 
shortly after they began. The other 
five matches that played to completion 
weren’t any more suspenseful as the 
Tritons dominated from start to finish.

UCSD’s top doubles team of senior 
Kazumi Negishi and sophomore Erik 
Elliott sent a statement early by rout-
ing Colorado Christian’s freshman 
Matthew Cooper and junior Andrew 
Wren by an 8-0 score. Negishi was just 
as impressive in his singles match at

BASEBALL — Rain may have can-
celled the Tritons’ final game against 
Grand Canyon University last 
Saturday but it was UCSD’s lineup that 
poured on the hits last weekend in 
Arizona. The No. 6 Tritons outscored 
the Antelopes 36 runs to nine in the 
shortened series on April 9 and 10, 
including a 20-5 bashing in the second 
match. The Tritons faced little opposi-
tion in the bookend games as well, 
shutting the Antelopes out 7-0 to start 
the three-game set and closing out the 
matchup with a 9-4 victory.

Following the series, UCSD was 

ranked No. 1 in the first NCAA 
Division-II West Regional poll of the 
season. The Tritons will take that top 
ranking into conference play April 
16 and 17 at home against Cal State 
Dominguez Hills — ranked sixth in 
the recent poll — still sitting atop 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association standings.

Wasting no time against the 
Antelopes, junior shortstop Vance 
Albitz led off the series with a sin-
gle to right field. With senior second 
baseman Garrett Imeson up to bat, 
Albitz stole second, setting the stage 
for Imeson’s RBI single to centerfield 
that gave the Tritons a 1-0 lead.

“Our offensive approach was to 
grind the pitching staff out,” Imeson 
said. “We knew they didn’t have a very 
deep bullpen, so jumping on them 

early was a priority.”
UCSD continued scoring, putting 

up runs in three of the first five innings 
and taking a 4-0 lead with sophomore 
pitcher Tim Shibuya dealing on the 
mound. Holding on to their four-run 
advantage, the Tritons broke the game 
open in the top of the ninth with senior 
first baseman Matt Cantele coming 

up with a big two-run double in the 
7-0 win.

The Triton offense tallied 15 total 
hits with Albitz, Imeson, junior out-
fielder Robert Sedin and senior third 
baseman Josh Tanner recording multi-
hit games. Shibuya held the Antelopes 
to four hits over eight shutout innings 
before senior Ryland MacFayden fin-

ished up the game, pitching a scoreless 
ninth.

“Shibuya is a spectacular pitcher,” 
Imeson said. “He has poise, good stuff, 
command and competes. His perfor-
mance on the mound against Grand 
Canyon reflects the special type of 
pitcher he is.”

UCSD’s lineup gave its second-

game starter, redshirt junior Matt 
Rossman, a sizeable lead to work 
with in the second inning alone. The 
Tritons sent 12 batters to the plate, 
scoring nine runs — adding to their 
two scores in the first — and driv-
ing the Antelopes’ starting pitcher out
