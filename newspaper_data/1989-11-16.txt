Harris Appointed Amid 
A.S. Council Debate 
By MARY BETIY HEARD 
StaflWrite,. 

Debate over the appointment 
of Vanness Harris as presidential 
representative to the A.S. Program-
ming Committee caused conflict 
at last night's A.S. meeting. 

Although Harris was eventu-
ally elected to the position by an 11 
to 0 vote with 9 abstentions, con-
flict during the meeting arose be-
tween Harris and Programming 
Commissioner Matt Schnurer due 
to a conversation that occured be-
tween the two prior to the A.S. Ac-
cording to Schnurer, the conversa-
tion concerned Schnurer's selec-
tion of TG bands. 

Harris complained during the 
meeting that the bands have not 
represented all students. 

Action Committee [SAAC] ... I'm 
going to be advising on whether or 
not what [Schnurer] is putting on is 
going to make this a happy cam-
pus." 

But, he acknowledged. "the de-
cision lies within his hands any-
way." 

Schnurer also questioned 
whether or not Harris was quali-
fied for the presidential appoint-
ment, a non-voting position. 

"I haven't seen him at any of the 
A. S. Programming Committee 
meetings ... does he really have an 
interest?" Schourer asked. 

Harris responded that he felt he 
was qualified because of his exten-
sive work with SAAC and other 
campus organizations. 

Last Friday's TG celebration on the Gym steps featured eclectic performer Mojo Nixon. 

Schnurer said that Harris had 
previously threatened to be a dis-
turbance to him unless changes in 
TGIF band selection were made. 

He also felt he should be a part 
of the Programming Committee 
because "people of color have a 
concern that TGs don't represent 
them ... you ask 'what can we do 
to make things a little bit better for 
TGs,' and maybe I can tell how to 
make it a little bit better." 

A.S. Sponsors Forum 
On Affirmative Action 
By DAVID BURKHART 
Senior SIaQ'Wriler 

A forum on the future of af-
finnative action entitled" Affinna-
tive Action Under Attack: A Fo-
rum on its Future," which included 
a panel discussion, a cultural per-
fonnance and an audience discus-
sion, was held Tuesday night by 
the Associated Students. 

Each of the forum's panel 
members spoke for several min-
utes on their reasons for support-
ing affinnative action. 

The first to speak, and the only 
faculty member on the panel, was 
associate chancellor and professor 
of psychiatry Nolan Penn. 

Penn discussed his family's 
background in Louisiana, where 
blacks were denied housing and 
job opportunities because of their 
race. 

"Many textbooks were embed-
ded with racist infonnation," he 
said, and added that these myths 
persist in textbooks today. 

Penn also outlined many of the 
ways in which blacks fought 
against segregation by fonning 
their own unions, social and aca-
demic groups and colleges. Penn 
also listed examples of accomplish-
ments of people of color, such as 
the process of blood plasma sepa-
ration. 

Penn said affinnative action's 
purpose is to give everyone equal 
opportunity and equal access. 

"Who can it hun? Who can a 

policy like that hun? I'd say it can 
hun no one," he said. 

Commissioner of Academic 
Affairs Darin Malloy, reading from 
a prepared statement, said he sup-
ports affrrmative action as a white 
student because "it's the right thing 
to do." 

Just a few shon years ago edu-
cational institutions were com-
posed iilfiely of white males, he 
said. 

Mallow added that there has 
been a large increase in racially 
motivated crimes in recent years, 
largely due to the rise of conserva-
tism. 

"Reagan was not very sensiti ve 
to the concems of people of color 
... the conservative message has 
been aimed mainly at white folks," 
he said. 

Another panel member, Mi-
chael Richardson, president of the 
African-American Student Union, 
said "racism is so overt right now 
it's killing us." 

Critics of affinnative action, 
often say it is reverse racism, 
Richardson said. 

"Reverse racism cannot be prac-
ticed by a group which has been 
disadvantaged for so long ... The 
black male is almost an extinct 
species on this planet," he said. 
Richardson also took issue with 
the idea that affinnative action's 
purpose is to right past wrongs, 
and said that its goal is actually to 
help underrepresented societal 
groups gain access to areas from 

where they had previously been 
excluded. 

After the members of the panel 
spoke, there was a cultural per-
fonnance by a percussion group 
called Lavalava Samoa. One of 
the members, Samoa Koria, is a 

See FORUM, page 3 

Harris told Schnurerthat he was 
"going to be a thorn in [my] side," 
Schnurer said. 

Harris defended himself by 
saying the threat was made in a 
joking manner, and that "there's 
going to be opposition because I 
represent the Student Affinnative 

After the meeting, Vice Presi-
dent Administrative Alex Wong 
commented that "it was disturbing 
that there was such negative [A.S.] 
feedback," adding that "you could 
see people taking sides." 

Germans At UCSD Respond To 
E. German Political Freedom 
By CHRIS STEINS 
ColJIribflling Writer 

Twenty-eight years after its 
construction in 1961, the Berlin 
Wall is finally coming down. 
Hundreds of thousands of East 
Gennans have already crossed 
the border into West Germany, 
and many are now returning to 
their homes in East Berlin, se-
cure in the Communist regime's 
promises of free travel and free 
elections. 

The Berlin Wall was both the 
symbolic and physical division 
between East and West Ger-
many, and while West Gennan 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the 
new East Gennan leader Egon 
Krenz will be meeting together 
to disc\JSs the future of East 
German. reunification of the 
two countries will most likely 
not be on the political agenda. 

The feelings of aoodwiU aen-
erated by the CMIl" Ire not 
limited to those in Germany, 
however. Accordinl to Tee 
KidaDe-Mariam. foreian student 

advisor, there are currently 10 
undergraduate and 32 graduate 
students in the Education Abroad 
Program from West Germany on 
the UCSD campus. 

1be feeling on campus seems to 
be one of "general euphoria that 
cuts across all political lines, pro-
gressive to liberal," said Elke 
Reibeling, a Gennan language 
teaching assistant. 

Martin Schmaltz, a graduate of 
the University of Goettingen in 
WestGennany and a senior at Muir 
double-majoring in physics and 
mathematics, has friends and rela-
tives in both East and West Ger-
many. After talking with them, he 
conveyed their feelings and his 
own: "I'm really happy about what 
happened - It's lreat!" 

German language teacbinl as-
sistant Michael Scaehle acknowl-
edpd that while the situation in 
East Oennany is "a drastic change 
in such a shon time, the reactions 
Ire totally positive." 

History Professor David Luft, 
who specializes in modem Euro-
pean history, said that the upheav-

als in East Gennany are compa-
rable to those in China, Hun-
gary and Poland, and create 
"many more realistic prospects 
for change. " 

Many of the German EAP 
students feel that although there 
are large numbers of East Ger-
mans crossing the border, over-
crowding will not be a major 
problem upon theirretum home 
at the end of the year. 

Assistant Sociology Profes-
sor MarthaLampland, who spe-
cializes in Eastem Europe. said 
that "taking down the Wall puts 
a material end to the Cold War," 
and at this point over shadows 
the potential problems of ec0-
nomic aid. 

Travel between the two Ger-
manics was possible prior to 
the new policies, but was usu-
ally not a practical alternative. 

Schmaltz lIaid that, some 
years ago, his uncle applied to 
visit West Gennany and was 
subsequently demoted to a 
lower-level job because, in the

Racial Slurs Lead To Gunfire 
on UCLA's Fraternity Row 

Fighting broke out on the street of UCLA 's Fraternity 
Row after racial slurs were exchanged between white 
fraternity members and black students, resulting in gunfire 
aimed at police officers and wounds to one person who 
fled and left a trail of blood two blocks long, UCLA 
authorities said Sunday. 

Three men were arrested as alleged accomplices to an 
unidentified assailant with a gun in the Saturday ruckus, 
said UCLA police officer Lt. J ames Vandenberg. The as-
sailant ran away after firing about a half-dozen random 
shots as scores of onlookers from waning fraternity 
parties watched the brawls escalate in the intersection of 
Gayley Avenue and Strathmore Drive. 

Besides the one wounded person - who may have 
been the assailant himself - no one was seriously in-
jured, but the 'gunfire stirred up pandemonium and a 
flurry of related violence in the neighborhood, Vanden-
berg said. 

" Everybody started running and started hitting the 
ground when the shooting happened," said Sgt. Jack 
Dahl. "It was pretty chaotic." 

The situation began to unfold at about 12:30 a.m. , 
when police went to the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity 
house on Gayley Avenue and told about 150 predomi-
nantly black partygoers from other schools to break up 
a loud and boisterous party there. Dahl said. 

Party organizers, apparently members of two hight 
schools rented the fraternity house for a black cultural 
celebration, police said. 

Most partygoers complied with police officers and 
left the building, heading toward the intersection at 
Strathmore Drive. There, a confrontation broke out be-
tween several black students and members of the nearby 
Beta Theta Pi fraternity on Gayley Avenue, Vandenberg 
said. 

Both fraternities issued statements Sunday. A mem-
ber of Sigma Phi Epsilon, who declined to be identified, 
said in a prepared statement, "The events that transpired 
... did not involve any member of Sigma Phi Epsilon nor

Rabbi Accused of Racism by 
Jewish And Arab Students 

About 40 Jewish and Arab students shouted down 
Rabbi Meir Kahane on Thursday when he publicly 
challenged the director of UCLA's chapter of Hillel, an 
international Jewish organization, to a debate at Hillel's 
activities center in Westwood. 

Kahane criticized Hillel and its director. Rabbi Cahim 
Seidler-Feller's "liberal" beliefs. 

Meanwhile, members of the Muslim Students Asso-
ciation (MSA) and lewish Student Union rallied against 
Kahane in protest of his presence and to support Hillel's 
rabbi. 

"This is outwardly expressive of [Kahane's) racist 
views," said MSA executive board member Ahmed 
Nassef. "We're here to protest the racist views of Meir 
Kahane and to voice support for Rabbi Seidler-Feller 
against all types of intimidation and racism that are used 
by the neo-Fascist Kahane." 

Arabs do not belong in Israel, said Kahane, who is the 
head of the Kach party, a group whose main objective is 
the expulsion of all Arabs from the state of Israel. 

"Palestine is a land for all humanity; it's not exclu-
sive," said MSA member Basil Karim. 

Onlooker Rebecca North disagreed: "I admire Ka-
hane. He speaks the truth; Jews have the right to Israe1." 

Kahane spoke outside Hillel after attempts to speak at 
Ackerman Union and with Seidler-Feller failed. 

On Oct. 24, UCLA's undergraduate government 
passed a resolution denouncing Kahane's positions as 
racist, and Hillel has also condemned his ideologies. 

Hillel's staff locked the center's doors, denying Ka-
hane access to speak atthe University Religious Confer-
ence on Hilgard Avenue, where Hillel meets. 

Hillel's staff posted a sign which said, "Kahane dis-
torts Judaism - to respond to Kahane is to support his 
racist. violent and bigoted ideology . . . tt 

"My point in coming was to say that when they closed 
this building to me, they closed it to students as well,"

Kahane said. "This was the sign of a diseased mind." 
David Bremer, coordinator of UCLA's University 

Religious Conference, watched the embittered exchange 
with disapproval. 

"When you deal simply with a complex problem [as 
Kahane would do with the Arab-Israeli conflict), people 
get hurt and, to me, [Kahane] is dangerous," he said.

Federal Investigation Clears 
UCLA Admissions Policies 

A federal investigation of UCLA's admissions poli-
cies has shown them to be non-ciiscriminatory, Chancel-
lor Charles Young told Academic Senate members Nov. 
7. 

Findings carne from investigations by the U.S. De-
partment of Education's Office of Civil Rights. which 
began an investigation last spring into the admissions 
practices of the University. 

But, "the conclusion of the investigation hasn't been 
released, "said Tom Lyon, Office of Civil Rights spokes-
person, in an interview with the UCLA Daily Bruin. 
"The investigation is continuing. We have not decided 
whether any schools have problems." 

The investigation of UCLA was a result of media 
reports and complaints from individuals concerning an 
anti-Asian bias. Harvard University was the other insti-
tution under review for similar allegations of an anti-
ethnic bias, 

Policies ofthe UCLA graduate schools of education, 
management and engineering as well as undergraduate 
admissions - the first part of the investigation - were 
reviewed. 

"We are very concemed that our admissions process 
accomplishes its goals and purposes, and that is di versi ty 
of the student body. We believe we have done that," 
Young said.

recent graduate of UCSD. 

The forum concluded with an 
audience discussion. Several other 
members of the audience said that 
affirmative action had helped them 
to gain access and to succeed at 

UCSD. 
When Malloy, who organized 

the forum, was asked why the panel 
did not include any opponents of 
affirmative action, he responded 
that the purpose of the forum was 
to discuss affirmative action in a 
positive light. It was not meant to 
be a debate , he said.

,violence Erupts At UCSD Event 
By RANDY OOTINGA 
Senior Staff Writer 

Violence broke out at a dance 
sponsored by the Alpha Phi Alpha 
fraternity in the Price Center ball-
room on Saturday night, UCSD 
Police said. 

According to UCSD Police Lt. 
J. Dyer, police broke up a fight 
during the fraternity'S dance in the 
ballroom, as a dance sponsored by 
the Chinese Student Association 
and the Korean-American Student 
Association continued in the other 
half of the ballroom. 

Dyer said the fight started about 
midnight in the lobby of the ball-
room "with two people, and esca-
lated to a group of four. . . the 
police pulled them apart to differ-
ent parts of the lobby." 

Lawrence Taylor, a member of 
the fraternity, said the fight 
involved "a couple of students that 
went to [San Diego] State. They 
weren't in any fraternity or any-
thing." 

Another fight was reported in 
the ballroom, but it was over when 
officers got there, Dyer said. 

The dance was attended by 
about 800 people, and ended about 
I :30 a.m., Dyer said. 

Although some at the dance 
wore gang colors, it was uncertain 
if gangs were involved in the fights, 
Dyer said. 

"There were a lot of off-campus 
people at the dance ... we really 
don 'tknow what started the fights," 

\ 

Dyer said. 
"Our dance was in no way con-

nected with any kind of gang 
activity, and there was no one from 
any gang at the dance provoking 
any kind of activity," Taylor said. 

Dyer speculated that many at 
the dance may have come from 
San Diego State University 
(SDSU), where violence had oc-
cured earlier on Saturday. 

According to the Daily AZlec, a 
series of fights involving over 20 
people occured at Greek events 
there Saturday. 

The fights at SDSU left one 
fraternity member hospitalized 
with a broken jaw, the Aztec re-
ported. 

"SDSUcalled and said the dance 
they were holding was cancelled 

and said all their people were 
coming over here. We were warned 
that there may be some trouble," 
Dyer said. He added that no arrests 
were made as a result of the fights 
here. 

"If we had arrested them, it 
would have tied up some officers 
taking them to jail ... and the rest 
of the campus probably wouldn't 
have been patrolled, due to all the 
paperwork" involved in the arrests, 
Dyer said. 

It is common policy for UCSD 
police officers to not make arrests 
for minor infractions, Dyer said. 

"The officers are instructed to 
not make an arrest unless they have 
to .. . if you have a scuffle, they 
should kick the people out and get 
back to policing," Dyer said.

Sources of Pollution 

Protecting the Oceans 
There is a refreshing new attitude towards the environment: 

many world leaders who once opposed environmentalism are 
now embracing it. The most obvious example is Margaret 
Thatcher, one of the most conservative European leaders, who 
recently delivered an address to the United Nations advocating a 
commitment to a clean environment. 

But it takes more than words. Coastal oceans around the world 
suffer from severe pollution, and cleanup efforts are only slowing 
the damage, not eliminating it. The sources of pollution need to 
be minimized, new approaches to cleaning up polluted areas need 
to be found and, most important, the public needs to be made 
aware of what they can do to stop pollution, 

The sources of pollution are myriad, and their effects can be 
insidious in a way that only comes from interfering with ecologi-
cal balances. One of the obvious sources is industrial dumping, 
although it actually doesn't account for a majority of the pollu-
tion. For instance, of the 182,000 lbs. of lead in the Hudson river 
in 1982, industrial dumping accounted for less than one percent. 

Industrial dumping is also easier to control. This isn't to say 
that it should be ignored, of course, since the effects of even small 
amounts of certain industrial wastes can be disastrous. One of the 
worst industrial sources is oil spills, and nearly seven percent of 
total offshore oil production spills into the sea because of blow-
outs, platform fires and other accidents, The devastating effect of 
oil spills was made clear by the Exxon Valdez disaster. 

Another pollution source is garbage. In the summer, beachgo-
ers in Los Angeles County leave behind 75 tons of trash a week. 
Much of this trash is plastic, a particularly bad source of waste' 
because it takes such a long time to decompose; scientists have 
discovered perfectly intact 50 year-old plastic items in the ocean. 
An estimated 26,000 tons of plastic packaging and 150,000 tons 
of fishing gear are dumped or lost in the sea each year. Not only 
does this harm the ocean aesthetically, but it causes the death of 
over 100,000 marine mammals and hundreds of thousands of sea 
birds each year, as they eat or become entangled in these plastic 
items. 

Pollution also comes from overfarming in surrounding areas, 
which causes a large amount of soil erosion. This runoff goes into 
the ocean, making the water murky and cutting off sunlight to the 
coral and sea grasses, which then disrupts the entire food chain. 

Runoff of other sorts is also very serious, and is probably the 
single largest contributor to ocean pollution, When it rains, tons 
of wastes from coastal cities are flushed into the sea. This waste 
comes from sources such as pel wastes, crankcase oil drained in 
driveways and fertilizers used on lawns. 

Another source is the heavy development on the coasts. It 
seems that everyone wants to Ii ve on the coasts and it is projected 
that three out of every four Americans will live within 50 miles 
of the ocean by 1990. 

This development exacerbates all of the above problems, and 
adds a few more. For example, wetlands, wh ich are natural filters 
of runoff, are destroyed to build new homes and condos. Also, 
there is increased sewage dumping. While a certain amount of 
dumping is acceptable, there is evidence that in many areas, the 
assimilative capacity has been passed. The Tijuana estuary is a 
perfect example. 

These problems must be dealt with quickly. As Jacques-Yves 
Cousteau cautioned a decade ago, "Poisoning the sea will inevi-
tably poison us," 
Monday's editorial will suggest solutions to ocean pollution. 

Editorial Board Childish It is your job to select and screen, to exercise your judgement and to 
take responsibility for your 
choices. 

Editor: 
Amazing what one finds in The 

GUilrdian these days. Cheesecake 
calendar ads, attacks on affinna-
live action, one editor who linked 
Willy Wonko and the Chocolate 
Factory to the crack wars in the 
streets, another who trivialized the 
use of non-sexist language with 
such cuteness as "wo-person." 
And the kicker is that derogatory 
Benson cartoon, depicting femi-
nists as fat, ugly, shrill Nazi butch-
ers. 

taken, my real gripe is the way you 
have set them out, then defended 
them. Be conservative if you must, 
but do so intelligently, and with 
respect for the opposition. 

Champion your causes, cer-
tainly, and don't shy away from 
controversial subjects, But it's no 
fair to use editorials to take cheap 
swipes at the 'letter writers . 

While I disagree strongly with 
many of the positions you have 

It is particularly offensive that 
you would hide behind the con-
cept of free speech, and patron-
izingly call those who disagree 
with you "censors" (as in one 
section of the Nov. 6 editorial), 
Surely you must realize that as 
editors, no editorial - including 
"Close Up" or Benson's syndi-
cated cartoons - can be printed 
without your collective blessing. 

I also calIon the Editorial Board 
to be far more sen~itive to the 
poorly-written and the asinine. 
Please, cut the illogical, twisted 
arguments, the glib cuteness, and 
the insults. We're not on the play-
ground anymore, and it's not re-
cess.

Flag Burning Should Be Against the Law 
By TOM MOMARY, Contributing Writer 

"We hold these truths to be self evident: that all 
Men are created equal and independent; that from 
that equal Creation they derive Rights inherent and 
unalienable; among which are the Preservation of 
Life, and Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness ... " 

Those famous phrases from the original draft of 
the Declaration of Independence hold the watch-
words of freedom. They are the principles for which 
the United States of America stands. Our nation was 
born from this revolution in thought-that we didn't 
need a king and people had a right to govern them-
selves. 

And over that country was flown a banner sym-
bolizing those ideas, representing them to all the 
world. 

Our flag was designed as a symbol from the start; 
no person can deny that it is one now. As such, it 
belongs to everyone who calls the United States their 
country. 

The editorial in the Nov. 6 Guardian was con-
fused. It contained philosophical errors that I now 
endeavor to set right. Though many people find it 
easy to hide behind the word "opinion," feeling that 
it exonerates them or at least prevents judgment upon 
what they say, there is such a thing as a right course 
of reasoning and a wrong one. 

And in this sense, the Editorial Board of The 
Guardian is wrong, I can speak openly and surely 
about it, since I once held the same position on the 
matter - that to legislate against burning the flag is 
a violation of the Right to pursue Happiness, 

The error stems from regarding our flag as pri vate 
property. If it were strictly so, then any limitation on 
its disposal or use would constitute a despotic act and 
the mailer would be clear. 

But the flag is undeniably a symbol and, though a 
person may purchase a flag and call it theirs, the 
symbol embodied within it is every American's. 
There is no way to bum the flag and not also dese-
crate that symbol of freedom. Both coexisi in the 
same object and cannot be separated, which puts a 
limit on what we ultimately may do with it. 

Furthennore, burning a flag is r.ot a rational pur-

BENSON 
t~There are those who

suit- no reasoning person would have cause to bum 
their own flag, nor would Ihey do it. Therefore, it is 
only irrational people who do so. And what they are 
doing is violently anacking the principles behind the 
flag; they are insulting all of America at once. 

Violence is not a fonn of expression. It is an 
imposition on the rest of humanity because it inter-
feres with the happiness of others. 

Some people, when speaking of this philosophi-
cal problem, have blurted out vague references to 
"the Constitution" or "the Bill of Rights," as if these 
were the root of our country, But never mind them, 
they both are compromises. You will not find the 
heart of our nation in them. Our rights exist outside 
of the Constitution. 

Certainly every human has a right to express his 
opinions, but he becomes answerable for them 
afterwards. Even if the violence of burning the flag 
(and when I speak ofthe flag, I mean aflag- banner 
flown in public places and at the mastheads of our 
ships, etc., to represent this country), even, I say, if 
violence constitutes an opinion, its nature as a viola-
tion of one of the Rights of Man makes it a crime to 
be answered for. 

And as every American owns that symbol which 
our flag is, an attack upon it is a destruction of the 
common property of all Americans. No one can have 
a right to destroy another's property, wherefore the 
burning of the flag is a violation of freedom not on 
one but two counts - of both the Right to pursue 
Happiness, and the Right to acquire, possess and 
protect property. We ought not to speak calmly of 
such a crime. 

Personally, I feel no need for legislation on this 
subject at all. But philosophically I see nothing 
wrong with such legislation. TIle freedom which we 
enjoy today was secured on this continent for us by 
Thomas Paine - our heritage is his legacy. 

The flag that flies over the United States, in its 
every flap and flutter, represents this legacy to the 
world. And it also represents us, It seems to me that 
when considering the spiteful burning of this flag, 
the flag of our country. we ought never to forget that 
we are the country.

Women are not objects to be 
weighed and measured, I've 
found out now at UCSD (often 
the hard way) that to really get

Features 
For Some Older People Returning to School it',S 

Better Late Than Never. .. 
·Story by Steve Weisman 
Contributing Writer 

In 197 I, Debbie Kelso 
attended her first class at UCSD. 
However, her dream of an 
educalion was "a dream de-
ferred"- she wound up working 
for 15 years as a bus driver for 
San Diego Transit. During the 
fait of I 988. Kelso retumed to 
UCSD- she was 38. 

Kelso is one of many UCSD 
students who fall into the am-
biguous category of "non-
traditional" or "mature" students: 
undergraduates who might be 
older, may have taken year off 
from college to work or experi-
ence life "out there," or may 
have spouses and children. No 
large lecture hall is complete 
without at least a few of these 
students, some of whom might 
be quite visible because of 
obvious age differences. 

"I remember my first day 
back," Kelso said. "I drove up -
1 thought 1 could park anywhere. 
1 got lost! The firsl term I got 
overwhelmed [by I the actual 
shock of coming back to school, 
from parking to getting up the 
nerve to go to the library." 

And, though she 6.drnitted that 
at times she has felt like 
cancelling all her classes and 
saying goodbye to university life, 
she said, ''rve come this far. 1 
know I can do it." 

In the summer of 1990 Kelso 
plans to graduate from UCSD 
with a degree in urban studies 
and planning and her decision to 
retum to academia is something 
she said she never went back on. 

"I always kept it alive," she 
said. 

Jayn Patron, a 29-year-old 
computer science and engineer-
ing major, shares some of 
Kelso's feelings. 

"I've always wanted to go 
back," she said, and after eight 
years working for Pacific Bell , 
she felt that a degree was a 
necessi ty if she were to move up 
in the company. 

Rebbecca Cobb runs a group 
called Siudents Returning After 
Time Away (S.T.R.A.T.A.) 
through the Third College 
Dean 's Office. Cobb, in her first 
year of involvement with the 
group, said that non-traditional 
students can be divided into 
those interested only in the 
schoolwork aspect of UCSD, 
who come to campus and then 
leave for home or work, and 
others who seek more involve-
ment in campus activity. 

Kelso places hersel f in the 
latter group. She said she finds 
more time to spend on campus 
because she has neither husband 
nor children, and may spend as 
many as six to eight hours a day 

f 

.1 
I' 

at school. 
"I try to be balanced," Kelso 

said. "The school's gotten bigger 
in fifteen years." 

Utilizing organizations such 
as S.T.R.A.T.A. or O.A.S.I.S. 
and contacts with professors and 
classmates, Kelso has built her 
own support system on campus. 
A lack of support, she said, was a 
major problem when she 
attended UCSD in the early '70s. 

Support is the focus Cobb sets 
for S.T.R.A.T.A. and its 12-15 
members, who meet weekly to si t 
and talk about what is going on 
in their lives, she said. 

"I think some people need a 
little assurance," Cobb said. "It's 
there if they need it. It 's a 
suppon that needs to be there. 
Many students do not contact us 
simply because they haven 't 
heard about it, or else expect it to 
be some sort of committee." 

One of the main problems 
faced by mature students that 
Cobb hopes to deal with through 
S.T.R.A.T.A. is communication 
with professors. She said that 
professors do not know how to 

deal with older students and 
either treat them as if they were 
18 or, even worse, treat them as 
if they should know everything 
and should not be struggling with 
the class material. 

"We hope to bring in some 
professors," said Cobb, "to open 
the lines of communication." 

Competing against and 
dealing with "traditional" 
students may also pose problems 
for mature students. 

"My biggest fear," Kelso 
admits, "was how younger 
students would perceive me, and 
how 1 would deal with the 
classes." 

Despite her early apprehen-
sion, however, Kelso now finds 
that most of her friends here are 
traditional students and she said 
they keep her "from becoming 
stagnant. " 

Patron said she experienced 
problems when she lived in an 
on-campus apartment. 

"It 's a whole lifestyle. You 
feel detached. You feel really 
different," she said, adding that 
she moved off campus after one 

month. 
For many students who have 

families, jobs, or have been on 
their own for more than a few 
years, problems at home may 
outweigh academic or social 
problems. UCSD students just 
out of high school may not face 
concerns such as paying a 
mortgage, locating a baby-siner 
or finding time to spend with 
their spouse. 

Patron admits that, "Having 
worked, you look at life differ-
ently. You realize there is life 
beyond midterms and final s. 
Sometimes 1 feel the need to go 
back to work to talk to people 
who understand." 

While neither Kelso nor 
Patron said they are having an 
easy time with their studies, both 
reflect confidence with respect ro 
the future . While making good 
grades remains a concern, both 
feel comfonable with their 
si tuations. 

"Now I can see the light at the 
end of the tunnel," said Kelso. 
"Last fall, when I was starting 
over again, all [ saw was ... fog."

Sports 
Showdown in Elizabethtown 

Men's Soccer Goes for Back-to-Back Championships 
By ANDREW ROBBINS 
Contribltling Writer 

After winning the CAADivi-
sion III West Regional Champion-
ships in frigid Minnesota on Sun-
day, the defending national cham-
pion UCSD men 's soccer team 
returned to California to find out 
that it couldn't pack up its winter 
gear quite yet. 

On Monday morning, the team 
found out that it would be heading 
to presumably colder temperatures 
in Pennsylvania this weekend for 
the National Championships, 
hosted by Elizabethtown College 
in a town with the same name. The 
Tritons will face host Elizabeth-
town in a semifinal matchup on 
Friday afternoon, while Greens-
boro College of North Carolina 
will face New York's Rochester 
Institute of Technology, last year' s 
national runners-up, in the other 
semifinal match up in the earlier 
game. ThechampionshipgamewiU 
be played on Saturday. 

Although the Tritons did cap-
ture the Division III crown last 
year, the fact that they had to win 
their last four games of this year to 
even qualify for regionals makes 
them admitted underdogs, accord-
ing to Head Coach Derek Ann-
strong. 

lnjuries have plagued the UCSD 
effort all season, and the team is 
clearly not what it was one year 
ago. Scott Goodman's early sea-
son-ending injury and Mike Kap-
pes' recent injury have wrested the 
14-5-3 Tritons of two players with 
valuable charnpionshipexperience. 

According to senior center for-
ward Carrick Brewster, 1989 has 
definitely been more of a struggle 
forUCSDthan 1988 because of in-
juries and the loss of some gradu-
ating players who were simply 
"irreplaceable. "B ut Brewster, who 
has his jersey number incorporated 
into his haircut, didn't readily sub-
scribe to UCSD's current view as 
an underdog. 

"Everything ' s equal at this 

point," Brewster pointed out. But 
he did express some concern that 
each team may be gunning for 
UCS D as defending national cham-
pions. 

Team captain and defender 
Mike Bradley reaffirmed Brew-
ster's confident outlook towards 
nationals. 

"We like to think of ourselves 
as meaner than the rest," Bradley 
explained, conveying the attitude 
of a team that does not have any-
thing to defend, but rather some-
thing still to prove. 

Two overtime victories (2-1 
over Claremont on Nov. 5 and 2-1 
over St. John's College on Sun-
day) in the regionals provided, at 
least, some proof that the 17th-
ranked Tritons are legitimate na-
tional contenders. UCSD, which 
has won its last three overtime 
games, claims overtime as an ad-
vantage of sorts due to certain team 
members' previous tournament ex-
perience.

Men, Women Could Produce Best Ever UCSD Finishes 

Cross Country Heading to Nationals 
By DAVE LINDSTROM 
SrajfWriter 

In 1982, the Triton men's cross 
country team made it to the nation-
als. That was the last time - and 
the only time - either the men or 
the women made it to the big meet. 

Until this year. 
This year, they both made it. 

Graduation Loss Great 

The Tritons have come close in 
the last few years - the women 
finished second last year and fourth 
the year before that, and the men 
finished second the last two years 
in a row. 

1ason Debley, one ofthe seven 
who will be running for UCSD on 
Saturday, pointed out that" ... in 
the last three years we've gone 

Rebuilding Year Ahead 
for Women's Basketball 

By DOUG SHADDLE 
SlajfWriter 

Graduation. This is the goal 
that all college students are sup-
posedly striving to achieve. 

But graduation is also the 
scourge of all college sports. 
Teams that are good one year can 
be easily devastated the next if a 
number of players depart. 

The UCSD women's basket-
ball team is a case in point. 

PRFVI E\\' 
Three of last year's starters-

Tracy Ragatz, Jill Koster, and 
Beth Koenig - have graduated, 
and their loss is expected to put a 
tremendous burden upon this 
year's squad. 

The 1988-89 team turned in 
the best performance in UCSD 
history. The 19-6 Tritons scored 
more points, won more games, 
and compiled a higher winning 
percentage, 76 percent, than any 
previous squad. 

In comparison, this year's 
prospects are bleak. 

"This is definitely going to be 
a rebuilding year," Triton Head 
Coach Judy Malone said. 

With nine new players, eight

two returning Triton starters. 

from a disorganized team toafinely 
tuned machine under coach Stan-
forth. " 

Head Coach Mark Stanforth will 
bring his squad to Augustine Col-
lege, in Rock Island, Dlinois, for an 
11:00 national meet on Saturday 
morning. 

For the men, Stanforth is taking 
Debley, Roger Webb, Mike Fox, 
Eric Kinney, Stefan Wynn, Steve 
Saatjian, and Merrel Hora. The 
women's team will consist of 
Michelle Conlay, Sabrina Jensen, 
Sharon Rockett, Yolanda Torres, 
Laura Peck, Kelley Booth and 
Karen Longyear. 

The race, which will take place 
on Highland Golf Course, is flat, 
fast and mostly grass, according to 
Stanforth. The Tritons, who are 
used to running on a combination 
of surfaces ranging from dirt to 
road, have been training this week 

out on the grass at North Campus 
Stadium. 

The women will be competing 
against fourteen other schools. TIle 
favorites to win are defending 
national champions Wisconsin 
Oshkosh and top-ranked Cortland 
State of New York. 

"If we can run a good, solid 
race, we can finish tenth," Stan-
ford said of the women's team. 
"With a really good race [we can 
finish] seventh or eighth." Indi-
vidually, he said that Conlay could 
finish as high as 15th or 20th, and 
Jensen around 30th. 

As for the men, who will be up 
against 20 other teams, Stanforth 
has a similar outlook. 

"If [the men] run well, they 
could finish ltenh to twelfth," he 
said. 

An exceptional finish will find 
the Tritons at seventh oreighth, ac-

cording to Stanforth. Oshkosh and 
Calvin College, Michigan, are 
men's favorites. Individually, he 
said that Fox, Webb, and Hora 
could all place in the thirties. 

Stanforth isn't worriedsomuch 
about how his teams finish overall, 
but rather how well they adapt to 
the new situation. 

He credited last week's wins 
(both teams finished first at region-
als) to smart running - the teams 
ran according to the style that fit 
them best. Some teams, he said, 
ran a silly race, goingouttoo fast in 
the hot Santa Cruz sun and ti ring 
out later in the race. 

"I'm not so sure about the men, 
but the women's team this year is 
definitely the best ever at UCSD," 
Stanforth said. 

Currently, the women are 
ranked 17th in the country, while 
the men are not ranked.

Men's Basketball Attempts to 
Regroup After DislDal Season 
By JOHN ASUNCION 

Slaf/Writ~r 

Before last year's season, 
men's basketball Head Coach 
Tom Marshall told the GUlJrdian 
that ...... with the talent we have, 
we're looking to win 18 to 20 
games this year." 

Marshall had every reason to 
be optimistic - his team was 
coming off a 17-9 season, one of 
its best ever. 

But somebody pulled the plug. 
It was bad enough for the Tri-

tons when expected returnees 
Andy Wagstaff and Nick Capu-
ano quit the team for unknown 
reasons. But then the Tritons ran 
into more trouble when theirmain 
offensive contributer, Tim Rapp, 
encountered academic problems 
midway through the season and 
was dismissed from the team. To 
make a long story shon, the Tri-

tons finished at 9-17, their worst 
record since the 198()"81 season. 

So what's new this year? 
Well, not much, but junior 

Rapp is back and so is junior 
Gordon McNeill, sophomore Rick 

I'IU \ ' II -\\' 
Batt, and sophomore Darvin 
Jackson. But this team doesn't 
have any seniors, and it isn't get-
ting any taller either - McNeill 
remains the tallest Triton at 6'8". 
Marshall, however, maintains a 
positive outlook. 

"We won't be hampered by a 
lack of size," he said. "Division 
III schools are traditionally 
smaller than other schools in 
Division I or Division II. " 

Marshall wiD play a lineup 
which will differ from the tradi-
tional center, two forwards, and 
two guards formation. Instead, he 

plans to feature two post players 
who will be responsible for play 
inside the key. There will also be 
two players on the wing who can 
either play in the paint or on the 
perimeter. A point guard, Jackson, 
will direct the offense. 

McNeill and Batt are slated to 
perfonn at the post in Marshall's 
scheme. Rapp and junior Tom 
Shawcroft, a new starter this sea-
son, will be filling the wings. 

Offensively, the 1989-90 Tri-
tons will be a running team with a 
good offensive perimeter game 
whose fo~ will be from the 12 to 
IS-foot range, according to 
Marshall. On the defensive side, 
UCSD will be playing several de-
fensive schemes; man-ta-man or 
in a zone. 

The bench, however, lacks 
depth-except forthepoint guard 
position, where junior Lance 
Catarozoli and sophomore Peter 

Selleck will back up 
Jackson. 

"We're not real 
deep," admitted Mar-
shall, "but we can easily 
go into the bench [for 
solid contributions]." 

Because of its status 
as an independent team 
in NCAA Division m, 
UCSD needs to win 20 
games to qualify for the 
NCAA Regionals. 

"We'll have to scrap 
for every game," 
Marshall said. "It's an 
unusual team because it 
has unusually good 
chemistry that plays well 
together. " 

Whether this chem-
istry can solidify into 
something that can pro-
vide a winning season 
for UCSD remains to be 
seen.

"We're not amateurs anymore," 
Bradley said. "We know how to 
handle ourselves in crucial situ-
ations. When we go into overtime, 
we get a very professional atti-
tude." 

And, while there is a solid core 
of experienced juniors and seniors 
on the team, it has been the play of 
two sophomores, Mike Alberts and 
Chris Hanssen, that has catapulted 
the eastern-bound Tritons into the 
nationals. 

Alberts, who leads the team in 
total points with 18 (goals x 2, plus 
assists), chaIlced up half of those in 
just three games. These three games 
marked the beginning of the late 
season winning streak which 
boosted the team into the postsca-

of whom are first year students, the 
team will be relying heavily on the 
six returning veterans from last

"With a little luck, we will be 
starting two or three seniors this 
year," MaIone said. 

Senior point guard Nancy Ca-
paraz and junior outside forward 
Bernadette Diepenbrock - both 
returning starters - are expected 
to be the core of this year's team. 

They will be helped by sopho-
more Carl Young at center and

Since then, Hanssen has taken 

the torch into the playoffs with a 
scoring run of his own, including 
a goal and an assist in Sunday's 
game. 

Senior transfer Craig Hyde, 
known as a"demon" by some team-
mates, has also been vital to the 
Tritons' late season burst Hyde, 
who joined the team late in the sea-
son, has compiled IS points in only 
seven games. But even a fire-
breathing demon won't help cool 
down the frosty eastern tempera-
tures. 

"It's hard to maintain a game 
mentality in the cold," Armsttong

freezing temperatures.

of year, either.

leen Alvarez or senior Nadirah 
Scott, who returns after a year 
studying abroad in Mexico. 

Among the new players, Lisa 
Beaver, a 6'2" center from Burl-
ingame High in the Bay Area. is 
expected to make an immediate 
contribution to the team. 

"We need to be stronger at re-
bounding. If Lisa learns a little 
more, we should do all right," 
Malone predicted. -. 

"In order to win this year, we' re 
going to have to push the ball up

Reaping The Harvest Of Success 

After, eight years, Tears For 
Fears has blossomed into one 
of the more influential bands of 
the eighties. 

Mlcbael A"IICII'lIU4lll'tl"m 
Curt Smith, amidst a sea of recorders 

Story By Lara HeIsler 
Hiatus Editorial Assistant 

It has been four years since Tears for Fears has 
done something new, and already their name is like 
a blast from the past_ The first images that come to 
mind when I hear "Tears for Fears" are: synthesizers, 
trench-coats, junior high dances in the gym, and 
Martha Quinn. That was then, and this is now. 
Tears for Fears has returned with their new album 
The Steds of Love, and the key word surrounding 
their comeback would have to be "change." 

When Curt Smith was in Los Angeles, he ex· 
plained that he and Roland Orzabal had tired of the 
techno-pop fonnula that they employed on their 
first two albums. Smith said, "I think for their time, 
The Hurting and Songs from the Big Chair were good, 
butl see their faults. I think The Huningwas tooster-
He, a little too precious. We didn't want [0 use 
guitars, we were into synthesizers, which was dumb 
because we are both guitarists. On Songs from the Big 
ChaiT, I don't think we were precious enough. We 
consciously treated it as a commercial venture, 
trying to get over the first album, so we were like, 
'HeIl, we'll jusr pur on screaming guitar solos .. .' We 
let ourselves go too far. HopefuIly, on Seeds of Love 
we've struck a balance between the two. We weren't 
trying to achieve anything on this album other than 
to end up with a recording that we thought was 
good." 

To create this "good" recording, the band not 
only drasticaIly altered their style and sound, but 
they also got by with a little help from their friends_ 

They replaced sequence machines and computer 
programs with flesh an<! blood musicians_ 

Smith said of this change, "You don't get in· 
spired by sequences. All a machine does is what you 
tell it to do, you program it and it does it. Musicians 
aren't that way. Machines don't add anything to a 
record, they just do what you tell them to do. These 
musicians added a hell of a lot to our record. They 
did things we'd never dream of doing." 

The musicians who have contributed so much to 
the new richness of the sound of Tears for Fears 
include drummers Phil Collins and Manu Katche 
(who has worked with Peter Gabriel), bass playe~ 
PinoPaIlidinoandJohnHassle.AccordingtoSmith, 
these are all artists whom "we've wanted to work 
with over the past, and we've admired for a Ion 
time. We were lucky that we never got turned down 
by anyone." In spite of the impressive list of recruits, 
the most notable collaborator on the album is not 
one of the aforementioned famous names, but ;1 
fantastic new artist, Oleta Adams. 

Oleta Adams was "discovered" by Smith an 
Orzabal singing in a hotel bar in Kansas while they 
were touring, and the two were moved by her talent 
and soul. Smith said, "Seeing Oleta play in this bar 
made us realize that we were supposed to be musi· 
cians, and we had tended to become computer 
programmers. We want~~ to change all that. She 
was kind of an inspiration to us!'

Pros And Cons Of 
Being A Deejay 

Manor arrived at the station the 
day someone quit. "I had never 
been on the air and had only seen 
a studio once before," Manor ex-
plained. "He listened to my 
aircheck and said, 'You're on to-
night, midnight to six.' There I 
was in this little bunker, no win-
dows, in the middle of an alfalfa 
field outside of Bakersfield playing 
heavy, heavy metal. And I loved 
it." 

By Patricia Jettie 
Hiatus Editor 

Sitting in the lobby of9lX, you 
can sense the energy that fills the 
studio as Katy Manor and Russ T. 
Nailz, two members of the station's 
"The Breakfast Club," verbally 
banter on the air. Manor's match-
ing black outfit and wild blond 
hair contrast with Naiu' rumpled 
sweats and baseball hat. 

The trio, which include Manor, 
Nailz and Dread Scott, are cur-
rently the single most successful 
San Diego morning radio show. In 
the second installment of a three-
part series looking at the people 
behind the voice, Manor recently 
d:;cussed the pros and cons of being 
a du;ay. 

Known for her perky demeanor, 
Manor has established herself as a 
well known personality, both in 
San Diego and Los Angeles. This 
success has been the outcome of 
ten years of hard work and persis-
tence. Originally a mobile deejay 
who worked weddings and barmitz-
vahs, she became interested in 
radio through the influence of a 
boyfriend. That love interest was 
Richard Blade, who is currently a 

• 

famous deejay at the Los Angeles 
station KROQ FM. 

Although their romance ended 
a long time ago, Manor claims 
Blade as both her mentor and close 
friend . Her first gig, both unex-
pected and unwanted, was some-
thing he set up. 

"He said to me, 'We've got a 
party coming up and I want you to 
deejay it. It's really good money, 
it's in Beverly Hills,' " Manor 
laughed. "Here's some big birth-
day party and the wife just looks at 
me. I've got this low cut dress on, 
[I'm) this young thing and this 
woman goes, 'Who are you l' And 
I say, 'I'm Richard's girlfriend. I'm 
your deejay tonight.' And she asks, 
'Well where's Richard?' 

"He's this English, charming 
guy who was supposed to be the 
deejay, but he went to another 
party that night. So the wife was 
disappointed but the husband, of 
course, loved me. I played the music 
[and was] sociable. He gave me 
this mega tip and he had me back 
the next year." 

From the Los Angeles club 
scene, the pair traveled to Bak-
ersfield. Through a stroke of lucie, 

After a few years in Bakersfield, 
she moved from KKDJ in Fresno to 
KNAC in Long Beach. Finally, 
Manor landed an enviable posi-
tion at KROQ, the "alternative" 
radio station in Los Angeles. Life 
was comfortable for about four 
years. 

Unfortunately, a new general 
manager then decided that she 
was not pulling high enough rat-
ings and fired her. Suddenly, she 
was faced with unpaid bills and 
fraught with self-doubt. 

"Everyone's gotten fired," 
Manor Sighed. "Rick Dees (KIIS 
FM, L.A.), Johnny Carson, some 
of the best news anchors. Your 
whole world exists around being a 
deejay. You think, 'I'm a deejay, I 
work at KROQ, I'm so bitchin'. 
They've got to love me because my 
ratings are o.k. and I do all the 
other promotions'. . . You never 
plan for these things. My world 
came crashing down. I got de-
pressed. I wondered if I got into 
this business because of Richard 
[Blade], was it a fluke? I always 
thought in the back of my mind 
that I couldn't have done it on my 
own."

While working for KROQ, 
Manor had received and declined 
offers [0 work at 91X. But, when 
the paychecks stopped, the San 
Diego station's proposition became 
a bit more appealing. Although 
the job involved becoming a part 
of the morning shift, the transi-
tion between job locations was 
even more difficult. 

"It was horrible," exclaimed 
Manor. "Upuntilfive months ago, 
I drove down to T .J. every single 
day. As if [hat ain't a bitch. We're 
talking the city smells, the roads 
are bad, the toilet [sometimes) not 
working for a couple of days and no 
water." 

The morning show, along with 
two other shifts, currently broad-
casts from San Diego. The change 
has helped emphasize some of the 
perks that go along with working 
the morning show, mainly the 
salary. Although Manor would not 

state the exact amount, she esti-
mated that her yearly income falls 
between $60 to $80,000. 

"I'm one of the higher paid 
deejays at this station," she admit-
ted. "When you've had four years 
experience doing this and you're 
the anchor and they've . built a 
name around you, you're paid. But 
(the amount) is not outrageous. 
There's others who are paid more." 

Manorclaims that the increased 
pay is a direct result of [he pressure 
associated with the morning shift. 
It is difficult to stay creative, day in 
and day out, while still trying to 
stay localized. 

As the show's anchor, Manor's 
role is to make sure everything 
runs smoothly. A se lf-enti tled 
"serious person," she describes her 
partners as "funny. Russ [T. Naiu) 
has the personality. Dread [Scort) 
is our news man/personality. He's

Exploring The State Of Darkness 
Soviet Etchings Depict 
The Power Of The City 

By Tiffany Shubert 
Hiatus Intern 

Paper architecture-what does this term mean to you? Alexan-
der Brodsky and lIya UtkinareSoviet architects whose etch ings and 
sculptures are on display at the La Jolla Contemporary Museum of 
Art and at the San Diego State Art Gallery until December 10. 

An enormous egg commands the attention of all who come to 
the gallery. The artists offer no explanation of the meaning of this 
immense sculpture, which is approximately fifteen feet high and 
twelve feet in diameter. The sculpture is bizarre, but intriguing. This 
is not the type of art that is usually expected to come from the Soviet 
Union. 

Brodsky's work is difficult to define. He does not attack his 
society or government. Rather, he celebrates the power of architec-
ture. Brodsky's etchings could have been created by any culture that 
utilizes the city as the source of power by the concentrated masses. 
Brodsky portrays the city as ominous, and with power over the 
inhabitants. 

The artists' etchings illustrate the impersonal power of the city. 
Buildings dominate the etchings, and occasionally a face of a man 
is sketched in the painting. 

The etchings are satiric, as the piece "The Ship of Fools or The 
Wooden Skyscraper for the Jolly Co." illustrates. This etching 
depicts the elite in their opulence as the city behind meshes into one 
force . This work is the only one in which a group of people are 
defined. 

Other etchings depict the city as missing a core. In one displayed 
piece, buildings upon buildings create the picture, which is tided "A 
Hill with a Hole," but no pecple or signs of natural life are incorpo-
rated in the work. 

The Brodsky etchings that are comrosed of buildings also have 
humanistic quotes that could have been created by any American

Her short stout legs and her unusually long torso are not 
those of a traditional dancer's physique. Yet, she dances like 
no other dancer does. Molissa Fenley, New York dancer/ 
choreographer, will bring her talent and hard-working deter-
mination to stage for two nights, Nov. 17 and 18 at the 
Spreckles Theater. 

Fenley's solo performances will include three pieces: "State 
of Darkness," "Esperato" and "Provence Unknown." Most 
talked about is the piece "State of Darkness," which is set to 
Stravinsky'S emotional and polyrhythmic dance score "Le 
Scare du Printemps." For Fenley, this score came about just 
after losing a close friend to AIDS and seeing the Joffrey Co. 
perform "Scare." "It's time now that we need a humanist 
point of view , because we are living in a 'state of darkness.' It's 
time we have to be vulnerable and giving," explains Fenley. 

Fenley then set out to choreograph an overtly emotional 
dance. She points out that even though in her mind her 
dances have always been about emotion in an abstracted, 
"architected" way, emotion has not always been apparent to 
the audience. The result, "State of Darkness," was an incar-
nation: it is a rather desperate act of faith in the future of 
mankind. 

In the past, Fenley's emphasis has always come from her 
seemingly never-ending supply of energy. Her workouts 
concentrate on endurance, as if she was simply trying, as an 
athlete might, to power her way through. In the past her 
dances have exhibited strength and gave little impression of 
an underlying emotion. A change has occurred since then: 
She now dances with the steadiness and strength that sug-
gests a body in perfect condition, but now also a dancer's body 
is in control rather than an athlete's. 

One interesting characteristic of the "darkness" piece is 
that it's performed with Fenley clad only in black tights. 
Bare-chested, Fenley reflects that part of her being that 
becomes vulnerable; part of nature in a 11 its mysterious forces. 
With the help of David Moodey's lighting, even the smallest 
movements, no more than a pulse through her diaphragm,

ABOUT SEX:

Continued from page 1 

When the band started work 
on their album, they remembered 
Adams. They went back to Kansas 
City, spent a week with her, and 
flew her back to England to start 
recording with them. Smith said, 
"She gave us a bit of what we were 
missing." 

The sound of the new album is 
drawn from multiple influences, 
but the most obvious is the Beatles. 
Smith explained, "We did prac-
tice deliberate Beatleism on the 
title track. The song is overtly 
political, so we wanted to catch it 
in a humorous backing track to 
create a certain irony. The im-
agery you get from the chorus is 
one of the sixties when love was 
the revolutionary word, before the 
modem yuppie era of 'It's more 
important to be successful and 
powerful .... ' " 

Seeds of Love is a diverse, com-
plex and thought-provoking al-
bum. Unlike their first two albums, 
which were highly personal and 
introspective, Seeds is a political 
album that touches upon a wide 
range of issues. Smith said, "We 
realized a very odd thing-that 
there's stuff more important than 
ourselves, like what is going on in 
the world." 

Smith and Orzabal employ dis-
tinct symbolism in each song. 
"Woman in Chains" is about the 
male repression of the emotional 
side in himself, and "Sword and 
Knives" was inspired by a book 
about the infamous Nancy 
Spungen, of Sid 'n' Nancy. "fa-
mous Last Words" is concerned 
with what one would do the day 
before a nuclear holocaust. The 
title track was written to express 
the displeasure the band felt about 
Margaret Thatcher. 

The Seeds of Love is definitely 
an album worth listening to, even 
if only to marvel at the metamor-
phosis the band has undertaken. 

Brodsky

institution that questions author-
ity. "For those who are tired of 
plastic vanity, for those who feel 
sick of foam rubber life .. . " is the 
inscription on "The Island ofSta-
bility." 

The Soviet Paper Architects 
question the validity of modem 
man's "achievements." In the big 
city, man is engulfed by immense 
buildings that suffocate life. The 
cities take over mankind. Brodsky 
questions the advantage of the city, 
and its influence on man. 

As you leave the gallery, a final 
glance at the large egg is required. 
You have to ask yourself "why?' 
Then you examine the expression 
of the man attempting to move 
the egg, and the American answer 
is obvious. The artists who created 
the egg are unhappy with the 
oppression of people everywhere. 
Brodsky believes in the power of 
the common man to conquer the 
city. Theexhibit is not depressing; 
it offer insight to man and the 
positive and negative effects of the 
creativity of humanity.

really sarcastic. He halances out 
Rusty and my perkiness." 

Yet Manor's favorite part of her 
job is meeting people and enter-
taining. She enjoys the idea of 
sleepy people rolling out of bed 
while listening to her voice. Yet 
she understands that the most 
important thing in radio is ratings, 
regardless of how long they last 
and how they are achieved. Sta-
tion owners want their sales repre-
sentatives go out to those prospec-
tive clients with proven success. 

In Manor's view, this goal can 
be attained merely by word of 
mouth. "You punch in, you like it, 
and your dial never moves," she 
claimed. "My train of thought is, 
'Well, wait a minute. I go for music.' 
I think people want to wake up to, 
yes a little news, a little conversa-
tion. But hey, shut up. I want to 
hear my Depeche Mode . Our 
morning show has some funny bits 
but it plays a lot of music. Some 
people think our humor is juve-
nile, and it is. People want to be 
shocked, they really do." 

She insists, however, that 91X, 
which aims for the 18 to 34 year 
old age bracket, will never achieve 
the consecutively high ratings of 
such rock stations like KGB FM.

nerability. 

Other pieces on the program 
will be "Esperato" and "Provence 
Unknown." Set to music by Phil-
lip Glass, "Provence Unknown" 
strikes out in a new direction from 
the earlier New Wave, aggressive, 
non-stop energy works. Actually 
choreographed to monastic burial 
music, this piece possesses a hint of 
melancholy coming through the 
large, curving arms and occasional 
hidden face of Fenley. 

Fenley grew up in Nigeria and 
Spain with her family, which has 
greatly influenced her dance style. 
Fenley then moved to Northern 
California to pursue dance in the 
different atmosphere at Mills Col-
lege. She began to consciously 
focus on developing her own meth-
ods of training, including running 
and weightlifting, and eventually 
incorporated into her training a 
modem barre. 

Fenley is not the first to make a 
move in choreography towards 
what she calls "humanism." Pres-
ent in all the arts, the current 
climate of death and alienatiOn in 
America is especially hitting the 
dance community. Post modem 
dance has traditionally focused on 
the physical form and aesthetic 
inquiry. A shift is occurring that 
seems to be stepping back in time 
towards expressionism. 

Fenley formed her own dance 
company in 1977, but decided to 
choreograph and perform as solo 
artist in 1988. Fenley will be con-
ducting a Masterclas for local 
dancer on Saturday, Nov, 18, II 
a.m. to 12:30 p.m. at the Sushi 
Gall ry. There is a fee for both the 
informal Masterclass and the eve-

easy. And you think, 'What is it? Is 
it the drugs or is it this pressure?' 
And it's a little of both." 

"I worked too hard to get where I

reluctant to force another disc

part of life. 
"There is this Judeo-Christian 

idea that you should be ashamed of 
your genitalia, of your body, hide 
from sex. 

"I try to teach my son, it's no big 
deal. It leads to pregnancy, but 
hitting someone leads to broken 
teeth, buying guns leads to shoot-
ing them .... " 

ELVIS AND RACISM: 
"Does anyone have any proof 

or examples? Public Enemy in Do 
the Right Thing said Elvis was racist 
in their song 'Fight the Power.' I 
think it's bullshit. I'm ready to 
wrestle Chuck D. in jello any-
time... Public Enemy broke up, 
they gist the Jews, and they got in 
trouble. But the real reason is they 
messed with Elvis and he put the 
whammy on them. 

"I don't know any specific in-
stances where Elvis did a racist 
thing. Elvis, ~ing a southerner 
from that time period, you could 
say every southerner was racist, 
that's nothing special. 

"Conceivably someone could 
say Elvis stole black people's music 
and made money off of it, but actu-
ally he stole black and white 
people's music. 

"I think Elvis felt a kinship for 
black people because he was using 
their music, but he was also using 
country music too." 

MARRIAGE: 
"I was living the married life 

before, for years, we were nor actu-
ally married. The main reason we 
got married, was so we could do it 
at my mom's. My mom would make 
us go out in the yard and do it ... 

"We were living together, al-
ready had a kid. Married life is the 
same, but now we can do it at my 
mom's house. I now make as much 
noise as I possibly can when I do it 
atmy mom's house, to let her know 
I'm exercising my privileges . .. 
exercising that is." 

POLIT ICS: 
''Now that the Berlin Wall is 

down, we need to go to China and 
help them tear down some walls, 
and tear some down in this coun-
try. It's nice to say, 'Those Rus-
sians are doing the right thing," 
but we also need to do the right 
thing. 

"The insane thing is the check-
point. 'Land of the free, give us 
your tired and your poor.' What's 
happening at that check-point, it's 
a sham. America is a giant coun-
try, there is more than enough 
room for everybody. 

"I think it's terrible that we 
have so much and people fifty yards 
from the border have nothing, 
there is more than enough to go 
around. 

"People that work hard will get 
ahead, people that don't will fall in 
the middle, people that don't do 
anything will fall behind. People 
that take charge and responsibil-
ity for their own life will do the 
best they can."
