TOKYO - In the hallways, 
bathrooms and lunchroom of the 
Bandai Corp., a major Japanese toy 
maker, the talk these days revolves 
around one topic - an an nounce-
ment that the company will pay 
employees 1 million yen, or 
$10,000. for every baby they have 
after their second child. 

Although many other compa-
nies give congratulatory bonuses 
to workers who become parents. 
Bandai is offering the largest baby 
bounty in Japan. which is strug-

The Muslim student group at UCSD did-

usually study and pray, and found messages 
of hate written on the chalkboard.

"I was really surprised someone would have

Many students were not made aware of the

"I think a lot of people have no idea that 
these things happen on campus: said Wcia 
Lee. a Muir junior. "Here at UCSD. students 
get so caught up studying theories and taking 
midterms that they become apathetic to real-

A.S. Council 
Approves $1 
Million Budget 
Funding Cut for Student 
Cable Works and Committee 
for World Democracy 
By MATT SCHRADER 
ASSOCIate News EdItor 

The A.S. Council released its new budget 
Wednesday, allocating over $1 million to 
student activities for the 2000-2001 school 
year. while cutting funding for the 
Committee for World Democracy and 
Student Cable Works by $2,000. 

Funding for thl.' Sun God Festival was 
also cut to $25,000 less than what was spent 
on this year's festival. The council allocated 
$161,000 to the programming office for 
campuswide events for next year . 

Seventy thousand dollars were allocated 
for Friday evening concerts known as 
"TGs: $8,000 for noon concerts known as 
"nooners." $62.000 fo r other concerts, 
$20,000 for comedians and lecturers and 
$1,000 for operating costs. 

In addi tion, the A.S. Council allocated 
$1 70.000 for events such as Sun God. 
Winterfest and Fallfest. 

Although $75.000 was allocated to Sun 
God for next year. Commissioner of 
Programm ing Cassie Will iams said that 
sum would not be enough to put on a good 
concert. 

She said that this year's Sun God 
Festiv?l. which was criticized by many for its 
lack of quality bands, cost over $100,000 to 
put on. 

Williams said she will have to request 
money from the amount that has been side 
aside as part of the general. unallocated 
fund . 

"As always, programming can request 
more funds from Ithel council. and has suc-
cessfully done so in the past; said Matt 
Powell. A.S. vice president finance. 
"Additionally. with an increased expectation 
in development, an increase in sponsorship 
should help as well." 

Ppwell also said that the booking of 
bands has less to do with money they are 
offered and more to do with the abilities and 
effort of the programmer.

Ueutenant Govemor Addresses Racial Profiling 
Bustamante, a~ ex-officio UC Regent, convenes conference at UCSD to encourage dialogue 
St."" Writer 

Lieutenant . Governor Cruz 
Bustamante opened the third con-
Rrcnce of his Commission for 
California's dialogue on racial pro-
filing last Thursday in the Price 
Center Ballroom. 

Bustamante, also an ex-officio 
regent of the University of 
California, made remarks in 
Spanish and English about the 
purpose of the commission's dia-
IOgUC on racial profiling. 

"We arc here to Cltprcss all 

viewpoints so that we may learn 
the other side," he said. "We are 
here to shed light on what differ-
ent Relings state agencies and 
non profits can do to settle this 
issue. We are here to seck solu-
tions. Through today's dialogue. I 
am confidant that the ideas will 
grow." 

. Racial profiling is the practice 
of police officers classifying people 
according to the color of their 
skin. 

Bustamante then introduced 
the opening speaker, Robert 
Kligaard. the dean from the RAND 

Graduafe School, In institute 
devoted to public policy. 

Kligaard said that having racial 
profiling banned from police pro-
cedure is not enough to end its 
practice. 

"Banning racial profiling is not 
a sufficient' solution because it 
would just be another rule and it 
wouldn't change behavior: he 
said. "We must collect data and 
create consequences for racial 
profiling." 

Chief Anuro Venegas, Jr. of the 
Sacramento Police Department 
said his department docs not con-

done racial profiling because it 
would violate the civil rights of cit-
izens. 

"Our definition of racial profil-
ing is the routine use of race as a 
negative signal that would cause a 
police officer to act or react with 
suspicion: he said. 

Venegas said that the entire 
Sacramento Police Department is 
receptive to collecting data of the 
race of those stopped.

"The quality of bands is highly 
dependent on the festival 's coordina-
tor, and less on the budget: he said. 
"The $100,000 figure. I believe, 
includes $10,000 budgeted toward 
'The Gleib Show: which won't be an 
issue next year: 

Student Cable Works received less 
funding than in previous years. 

Powell said the majority of the cut 
was made because Student Cable 
Works had an expense this year that it 
will not have next year. 

"Student Cable Works received a 
much smaller cut from 21,500 to 
18.700, approximately; Powell said. 
"This cut reflected the withdrawal of 
a circuit charge that was ac tually 
unnecessari ly paid, which accounts 
for approximately $2,600 of the cut: 

Other student organ izations on 
campus funded by the A.S. Council 
also rece i,'ed their budget for next 
year. Cultural Awareness programs 
received $48,000 for their activi ties, 
while the Committee for World 
Democracy received $1 2,000, which 
represents more than an $8,000 
decrease in their funding from last 
year. 

"Committee for World Democracy 
received a cut from $20,000 to 
$12,000, with the understanding that 
Iitl would be able to come to finance 
and request additional funds for the 
larger events (itl Wished to put on: 
Powell said. 

Powell said these cuts in their 
budget have caused concern and 
anger to those from Student Cable 
Works and the Committee for World 
Democracy. 

"Both CWO and SCW met with us 
several times, and have, for the most 
pal1, remained diplomatic and coop-
erative throughout the process: he 
said. "CWO is currently deciding how 
to adjust {its! operations to this new 
allocation. Some of the members have 
expressed an understanding both of 
council's desire to keep lines of com-
munication open. and of our hope 
that CWD will be able to come and 
request additional funds as needed. 
However, soene I'~ople have taken this 
cut as a p<~rsonal o:tt!d: en CWD's 
voice. and have ceased to regard dis-
cussion with council wOl1hwhile: 

Amid speculation that the amount 
of money allocated to last year's exec-
utives for travel was too high, the 
finance committee decided to decrease 
the funding to $2,500, more than 
$2,000 less than the previous year. 

The A.S. marketing department 
received $35,900 for campus barbe-
cues, class schedule supplies and 
other expenses, while the Financial 
Committee gave Triton Taxi $10,000 
for taxis and Student Cable Works 
$18,726 for its television and radio 
broadcasts.

4 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Tuesday, May 30, 2000 

The House of Representatives, anticipating China's admittance to the World Trade Organization within 
the year, has voted to nonnalize trade relations in an effort to prepare for the market of the 21 st century 
By BRENT DON 
Opinion Editor 

On Wednesday, the House of Representatives 
voted to normalize trade relations between the 
United States and China. This legislation would be 
a departure from the current U.S. policy of annu-
ally voting on whether to renew China's most-
favored nation status. Proponents of the move 
include the Clinton administration and corporate 
interests, and opponents include labor unions and 
human rights activists concerned about reform in 
China. The Senate will vote on the bill next 
month. 

China is shaping up to be an important and 
complex player in the 21 st century. Its aggressive 
stance toward Taiwan has already caused much 
·concern for the United States, as well as the rest of 
the international community. It is unclear what 
effect the continuing debate over democratic 
reforms taking place within China will have on the 
country. With the impending concession to more 
liberal economic access to China for the interna-
tional community, the debate over normalized 
trade relations is just the tirst of many develop-
ments in which China will playa key role in the 
coming years. 

There are some who have characterized the 
drive toward normalized trade relations with 
China as mere capitalist greed. It would be an 
abject lie to say American companies do not stand 
to benefit immensely from freer trade, but that is a 
far cry from proving that this is the only reason for 
it. The move will carry a number of obstacles that 
will need to be overcome, but the opportunities it 
can offer for every American and Chinese seem to 
outweigh these potential hazards. 

It is no secret that the United States is dis-
pleased with China's human rights record and its 

system of one-party rule under communism. The 
upcoming June 4 anniversary of 1989's demon-
strations for democratic reform in China's 
Tiananmen Square is a reminder of the internal 
struggle China has long-undergone over its politi-
cal determination. The United States has been a 
strong advocate of reforms within China and has 
frequently turned toward economic pressure as a 
possible means of effecting such reforms. 

History'S most dramatic success story of U.S. 
attempts to liberalize a foreign power is the break-
up of the former Soviet Union and the democrati-
zation of Russia. This was not accomplished 
through harsh economic sanctions or threats, but 
rather through cooperation and the gradual open-
ing of Soviet mar-kets to the West. The late Soviet-
era policy of glasnost does, after all, mean "open-
ness." The USSR was not defeated by economic 
war; rather it succumbed to the greater opportuni-
ties afforded by access to the international market. 
McDonald's and Coke, not tariffs and nuclear 
weapons, won the Cold War. 

If the United States wishes to undermine or 
reform the communist regime in China, the last 
great stronghold 'of communism in the world, it 
must do so through cooperation and collabora-
tion. From a long-term foreign policy standpoint, 
it makes sense for the United States to increase 
free trade access to China. . 

Another important consideration is that China 
is almost certainly going to join the World Trade 
Organization, regardless of what actions the 
United States takes in determining its trade status, 
When China does join the WTO, any attempts by 
the United States to deny it free trade access will 
be a breach of the organization'S requirements, 
which state that all members must have consistent 
trade access with all other members. 

A disheartening scenario where China joins the 

WTO and America does not extend normalized 
relations is one in which European states step in to 
take advantage of Chinese markets. Members of 
the European Union are eager to take advantage of 
China's impending admission to the WTO by 
establishing footholds in a country with over a bil-
lion consumers. Regardless of whether the United 
States hesitates in taking advantage of this new 
market, the European states will not. America 
stands to lose great economic opportunities to 
Europe if it turns down the considerable conces-
sions the Chinese have offered in opening their 
markets in accordance with the WTO's guidelines. 
The United States is the biggest market in the 
world, but it is not the only market; assuming that 
another country will not take advantage of the 
opportunities in Cilina if the United States passes 
them up is foolhardy. 

'Opponents of normalized relations with China 
have two major points of contention with the pro-
poSilI: First, they argue that the annual review is 
the United States' only bargaining chip in trying to 
force China to effect reforms in the areas of 
human rights and democratization. Second, union 
representatives are afraid that opening access to 
China as a source of cheap labor will cost 
American jobs. 

The failure of economic sanctions and restric-
tive policies imposed by -' the United States in 
coercing foreign governments in the realm of 
human rights is best exemplified by the economic 
sanctions imposed on Iraq, a nation that has per-
sisted in repressing the dissident Kurdish popula-
tion of its country and defying U.N. weapons 
inspection teams despite the international com-
munity'S imposition of trade embargoes. In the 
matter of attempting to coerce nations into effect-

Tuesday, May 30, 2000 The UCSD Guardian OPINION 5 

Prop 209 is Correlated to Minority Admission Decrease; It is Not the ~ause 
Editor: 
This letter IS m response to 

Malavika Gangolly's article 
("Finding Diversity: May 22). The 
anicle was well written and it 
brought attention to certain out-
reach programs that UCSD has 
and to the fact that UCSD is still 
interested in making this campus 
more diverse. However, the 
author's review of the past few 
years has made the same great mis-
take as many previous articles on 
the subject. 

Now. I did not get a very good 
grade in statistics. but I still took 
tile course and I know that most 
humanities and social science stu-
dents have to take a similar course. 
yet this same error. is made time 
and again: In the beginning of the 
article, Gangolly states that there 
has been a change in the number 
of minority students admitted to 
UCSD after the passing of 
Proposition 209. She says that 
there has been a significant drop in 
the admissions of African 
Americans and Native Americans 
the yea! a~er Prop.209 passed. This 
is a false correlation. I got a bad 
grade in my Ethnic Studies class 
the very same quarter that 209 
passed, but I am sure that these twO 
incidents have nothing to do with 

China: 
Development will not be 
without its hardships 

ing democratic reforms, one need 
look no further than Cuba, whIch 
Ilas suffered under a U.S.-enforced 
trade embargo for decades without 
showing the slightest signs of 
reform. It seems apparent that eco-
nomic sanctions only serve to 
embitter international relations, 
and it is undoubtedly a good thing 
that the United States has never 
elected to anger Beijing by revok-
ing ehina's most-favortd nation 
status in the past. . 

Organized labor's concern with 
the bill. namc\y that it will elimi-
nate jobs in America. is a valid 
point, but one that is not without 
redress. Increased trade with China 
will go botll ways, so while 
American industries will be scaling 
down in some sectors, they will be 
stepping up production mother 
sectors, creating new job opportu-
nities for displaced employees. 

Taking up a new trade is never 
easy, and unions are an important 
force for trying to protect their 
members from frequent and diffi-
cult upheavals in job security. At 
the same time. it is dangerous for 
the American work force to ignore 
broad trends in the job market. 

As American industry shifts its 
focus away from production that 
may be moving to China and 
other countries, it is vital that 
American workers acknowledge 
patterns and migrate to the new 
industries - many in the high-
tech and bio-tech sectors - that 
will replace them. Care must be 
taken to make this shift gradual so 
that America's work ·force is able 
to make the transition, but the 
process must begin at some point. 

Normalized trade relations will 
not alleviate all of the United 
States' concerns with China, nor 
will it fix those it can influence 
overnight. The fact is, however, 
that denying China normalized 
relations will only serve to ali~nate 
the two countries. creating a dis-
tance between them that will make 
it exceedingly more difficult for the 
United States to try to compel 
reforms within China. Normalized 
trade relations are the first of many 
important steps toward bringing 
China into the fold of the interna-
tional community, and though it 
may be a difficult one, we must 
have the courage and the foresight 
to take it. 

each other. There is no real proof 
in Gangolly's claim that the p~ssing 
of Proposition 209 had anyt~mg .to 
do with the number of mmonty 
students admitted the following 
year. 

I do appreciate that she did 
mention that these numbers come 
from a function of those that 
applied versus those that got in, 
"the percentage of . African 
American students who applied 
and were admitted dropped from 
54.7 percent to .. , 27.8 percent." In 
the past, tile UCSD admission 
reports have failed to give us all the 
data. Admissions data, when not 
compared to applicant data, is 
utterly useless, so I commend 
Gangolly for that bit of research. 

Assuming that these numbers 
do correlate with the passing of 
209, we still come to a problem 
when we remember that the UC 
Regents discontinued affirmative 
action policy one year BEFORE 
209 passed. Taking this into 
account. we might be able to say 
that the lowered numbers of 
minority applicants is a result of 
being scared away by a school that 
(in some people's eyes) does not 
want minorities since they gOt rid 
of affirmative action. Of course, 
this is just not true. Gangolly

The thing that really bothers me 
is how anyone could consider 209 
to be a racially skewed policy. It 
states that there will be no differen-
tial treatment based on race or any-
thing else. What is wrong with 
that? Isn't that the American ideal? 
Affirmative action was a quick tix 
for a failing education system that 
is still racially skewed due to past 
racism. However, affirmative action 
policy is itself racially based. and 
thereby keeping racism, and espe-
cially racial categorization, alive. 

In closing. I would like to 
address another issue brought up 
by Gangolly's article and several 
others: this whole struggle to find 
diversity in the first place. What is 
being defined as diversity is total -
ly based on skin color. This is not 
a true measure of diversity on any 
meaningful level. This ca mpus 
has a very diverse atmosphere. 
There are people that come from 
very well-off backgrounds and 
those that have to struggle with 
loans and grants in order to pay 
for their education here. There are 
people that come from California 
and those that do not; ask any 
non-native Californian if there is 
a difference and he or she will cer-
tainly say yes. There is much more 
diversity that I do not have time to 

mention here. This is the real 
diversity we have at this school. 
Increasing the number of those of 
certain skin colors so that the 
school can be more "diverse" is a 
superficial tactic and ultimately 
will not succeed in adding any-
thing new 10 campus. Just because 
someone might have the same 
skin color as you does not nec!:s-
sarily mean you will have a lot in 
common.

Reflecting on the Year's End News Media Gets High Marks for Purpose 
Author sheds light on her lessons from UCSD Local journalism is run as a business; but still serves the public interest 
By SHANNON CASlU 
Columnist 

I'm having a hard time believing 
the school year is almost over. It's 
almost harder to believe I've spent 
so much time in class and have 
taken almost nothing out of them. 
I barely remember last week 's 
material, let alone the stuff I 
learned in the fall. 

Fortunately, just being part of 
the UCSD community this year 
has taught me quite a bit. I'd like to 
share some of the things I've 
learned with you, in the hope that 
they will allevia te some of your 
grief over the 10 s of the all-campus 
commencement. I'm not a famous 
poet, but here's my end-of-the-
year address for you all: 

People 111 power will generally 
find a way to abuse it. Unless the 
rest of us do something about it, 
they will continue to do so. A rep-
resentative government doesn't 
represent its population very well if 
the population doesn 't care 
enough to vote or to pay attention 
to what is going on. 

I will never understand men, so 
I should quit trying. I apologize for 
any anicles I have written in the 
past that attempted to explain , 
change or make fun of the opposite 
sex. It's a futile endeavor and I 
promise not to make you read junk 
like that ever again. 

As much as some people on 
this campus like to talk about the 
Ideal of school unity and spirit, 
the only thing that even comes 

close to unifying our campus is a 
yearly drunken tribute to a big, 
painted bird. 

Life is unpredictable; even for 
Maya Angelou. 

While it's easy to agree or dis-
agree with Michael in the privacy of 
your own head, it's considerably 
harder to wear a bright blue T-shirt 
proclaiming your opinion to the 
world. 

Walking to class from distant 
parking lots is actually pretty good 
exercise if you do it often enough. 
Think of the parking problem as 
the regents' contribution to your 
cardiovascular health. You'lI thank 
them someday. 

If you have nothing intelligent 
to say, keep your mouth shut. This 
applies to most of the people ask-
ing questions in lecture, to a few of 
my TAs, and most definitely to me. 
Unfortunately, I'm getting paid to 
ramble unintelligently, so you'll 
have to put up with me. Better yet, 
exercise your freedom of choice 
and stop reading. 

For those of you still with me, I 
have one last pearl of wisdom to 
impart upon you: Believe in some-
thing. If there's one thing I can't 
stand, it's apathy. The world is 
much more fun if people have 
opinions and talk about them. 

While I can hope to retain some 
of the knowledge that I've gained in 
the classroom, these are the things 
that I know will stay with me. It 's 
hard to believe I'm paying for this 
education.

Contributifll Writers 

The American news media is a 
mysterious industry to most. It is 
greatly misunderstood by the 
majority of its audience, who are 
not aware of the process involved 
in deliverins news to the public. A 
news story IS not just a script that 
an anchor reads on television. It is 
a special commodity that is pack-
aged by the station and presented 
in a specific fashion . 

This presentation is determined 
by the source, whether it be a small 
television station in a remote town 
or a huge network in a big city. 
However, the goal is the same: to 
present the audience with knowl-
edge that will leave them feeling 
infonned and up to date on events 
that may affect their lives. 

We have recently completed a 
study of a San Diego television 
news station. It is our contention 
that the public assumption about 
news production and the reality of 
news production remain at odds. 
Due to the fact that 76 percent of 
UCSD students polled watch local 
news, and of this percentage, 52 
percent rely on local news as their 
primary news source, it is impera-
tive to inform the UCSD commu-
nity about the realities behind 
local television news production. 

We have long conditioned our-
selves to question everything we 
hear on the news. We assume 
details have been added and 

. Yes, as a natter of fact, 
we give you DDre c:pi.ni.ce tbeIn you 

words changed to add dramatic 
quality. Many see the news media 
as always pushing in where they 
don't belong. their own agenda 
often taking precedent over truth-
ful and quality reporting. As the 
assistant news director of a local 
television station told us, "We arc 
a business and the goal of any 
business is to make money. In 
order to make the money we have 
to get the ratings - and we do." A 
station can deliver quality news 

News programming is 
generally not considered a 
money-maker for a 7V 
station. Its role is t1J lend 
credibility and local 
identification to its viewers. 
without compromising monetary 
reward. It is as simple as being in 
tunc with the audience. 

During the course of our 
research we were surprised. yet 
relieved, that for the most pan 
what you see is what you get when 
it comes to local television news. 
We cannot claim that stories are 
never exaggerated or transfonned 
to fit particular contexts. Yet, after 
the completion of our research, 
we do believe that the main objec· 
tive of the news is to infonn. The 
news is not there to tell us what to 
think, but simply to encourage us 
to think about the impact of news 
on our lives. It arms us with the 

tools needed to fonn our own 
opinions. 

Television stations rely on 
advertising revenue to finance 
production. It was our belief that 
this reliance on ad revenue influ-
enced news production. However, 
we found news programming is 
generally not considered a 
money-maker for a TV station. Its 
role is to lend credibility and local 
identification to its viewers. 
Although most revenue for the 
station comes from advertising, 
local news.is not considered a 
profit generator. Therefore, it is 
our conclusion that in local televi-
sion newsrooms, advertisers come 
second after credibility in news 
reporting. The advertiser's influ-
ence in TV newsrooms is signifi-
cantly less penetrating than we 
had previously assumed. 

Local news is part of a larger 
institution of the news media 
encompassing print, on-line. radio 
and national television news. As a 
member of the "fourth estate." the 
only collateral local news has is its 
credibility. Viewers trust the 
anchors delivering their news, and 
the success of a news broadcast 
depends on this connection. Local 
news has a responsibility to be 
truthful and objective. Even 
though the goal is to get ratings 
and make money, sensationalism is 
not necessary to gain an audience. 
As the assistant news director said, 
local news is a business. That busi-
ness IS to II1fonn .

Serbia Needs Support, Not Reproach Letters: What was the name of that 
little Cuban kid again? The U.S.' policy in Serbia has onry caused further problems in the tumultuous Balkan state 

By IOIIIS HUe 
Contributinl Writer 

Serbia is back in the news. This time, it 
is on the brink of war with itself. Siobodan 
Milosevic, the Serbian half-dictator, is 
oppressing tht opposition and limiting the 
freedoms of various media outlets. Why 
don't we care? Why should we care? 

We are all led to believe the Serbs arc 
evil: rapists, ethnic cleansers, murderers, 
fascist dictators, Milosevics, Bolsheviks or 
just really bad . Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright and President Clinton 
havt said as much . Have you ever met a 
Serb? Perhaps you also believe their 
women are large and hairy. 

Though not a hairy woman, I am half 
Serbian, and for the past seven years I have 
read and watched in disgust as the Western 
media continually robbed the American 
people of the truth, at times not even pre-
tending to be evenhanded in its coverage of 
the ongoing Balkan conflicts. 

It is pointless to argue at this time 
whether the Serbs are collectively responsi-
ble for the impending implosion of their 
nation; whtther Milosevic is to blame; 
whether the role the United States played 
in the des:ruction of YugoslaVia will be 
viewtd favorably by history. Many ques-
tions remain. 

Misinformed or not, most of us do not 
care about the well-being of Serbia because 
the Serbs were established as evil in each 
act of the play detailing the breakup of the 
former Yugoslavia. 

This latest act, however, is very different. 
European integration has been hard 

enough without any more European wars. 
Whoever rules Serbia, at tht center of the 
Balkan peninsula, is in a position to make 
wars happen . Nearly every one of our best 
think-tank experts agrees that Serbia is the 
anchor of the oxymoron known as "the 
Balkan stability: If the Balkans become 
stable, the miracle of free market economy 
will bring us cheap plum brandy, free edu-

The Serbs themselves initiated 
the struggle against Milosevic 
long ago, but their progress was. 
impeckd by questionable 
American polUy. For a long time, 
Serbia was the onry Balkan state 
with atry sort of viable opposition 
t1J Milosevic. That opposition has 
been ckalt a huge blow with 
every move mack by the United 
States in the last ckcade. 
cated young people and inexpensive skilled 
labor. This is why macroeconomists want 
you to care about Serbia. 

The Serbs themselves initiated the 
struggle against Milosevic long ago, but 
their progress was impedtd by question-
able American policy. For a lon~ time, 
Serbia was the only Balkan state with any 
sort of viable opposition to Milosevic. That 
opposition has been dealt a huge blow with 
every move made by the United States in 
the last decade. 

First, the United States obviously sided 
against the Serbs in each ethnic conflict 
since 1991, simultaneously supporting the 
Serbian opposition to Milosevic. This had 
much the same effect that Josef Stalin 
would have had in the United States dur-
ing the McCarthy era had he lent his 
unequivocal written support to Paul 
Robeson, Charlie Chaplin and other sus-
pected reds. 

The United States then fought for com-
prehensive sanctions against Yugoslavia -
the same policy that has worked such mira-
cles in changing the Cuban government 
through the last nine Washington adminis-
trations. 

Next, while U.S. planes w~re bombing 

Belgrade, Albright voiced her opinion in 
the cliche about "Milosevic and his Serbian 
war machine" being Satan incarnate . 
Bombing and preaching did not chase away 
Saddam Hussein . And it will not get rid of 
Milosevic. All it has accomplished is to 
leave Milosevic - a crazy, brilliant strate-
gist - with military, police, judicial and 
legislative powers. 

Finally. in open contlict with the 
Serbian government, the United States 
openly channeled funds to certain opposi-
tion parties, thus partly legitimizing 
Milosevic's legal maneuvering that led to a 
series of oppressive media laws. After all. 
the American public was not very accepting 
of the Chinese money that allegedly 
worked its way into the White House dur-
ing the Clinton presidential campaign. 

We must support otpor; meaning "resis-
tance: a nonhierarchical movement of the 
Serbian people against Milosevic and his 
nationalist government. We can do this by 
adopting the targeted sanctions proposed by 
other European nations to show all Serbs 
that the opposition can successfully bargain 
with the West and bring prosperity to Serbia. 
Such sanctions would also be reasonably 
effective against Milosevic and his allies. 

We must also assure Serbia that it will 
remain the centerpiece of the Balkan scene 
even without Milosevic - supported with 
Western monetary aid - not because we 
want that. but because it is indeed the cen-
terpiece. 

Above all . we must learn to be attentive 
and quiet when appropriate, because some-
times inaction is beller than witless action . 
We were quiet and inattentive about the 
Rwandan genOCide while inducing another 
one in the Balkans. If we are to claim any of 
that "moral authority" mentioned so oftel1'3t 
times when we were bombing Belgrade. we 
must begin to treat the Serbs impartially and 
ensure they do not die needlessly at the 
hands of Albanians, Croats. Americans or 
other Serbs.

Former Indonesian President Under House Arrest 

JAKARTA, Indonesia 
Under intense public pressure to 
get tough, the Indonesian gov-
ernment placed former President 
Suharto under house arrest 
Monday as it sought 10 try him 
on charges of corruption and 
abuse of power. 

Suharto, 78, has been debilitat-
ed by three strokes and is appar-
ently able to communicate only in 
his native Javanese language. He 
has managed, with the help of his 
lawyers, to complicate repeated 
attempts by investigators to ques-
tion him in his home. 

The house arrest, which does 
not materially change Suharto's 
living conditions, was instituted 
"to smooth the investigation !lnd 

in order to finish the case as 
scheduled: said Yushar Yahya, a 
spokesman for Attorney General 
Marzuki Darusman. 

Monday'S move came almost 
exactly two years after Suharto, the 
all-powerful president for 32 
years, stepped down on May 21, 
1998, in the face of riots and stu-
dent protests and under 'pressure 
from defecting government minis-
ters and even from his mos.! loyal 
military leaders. 

The two-week house arrest 
order, renewable in 30-day incre-
ments, carried a powerful symbol-
ism in a nation that is struggling, 
sometimes chaotically, to convert 
itself from Suharto's iron-fisted 
rule to an open democratic sys-

tern. 
The order responds to an over-

whelming public desire for 
accountability that has shown 
itself most forcefully in frequent, 
sometimes violent, student 
demonstrations. 

It is also part of a broad gov-
ernment program to investigate 
and potentially mete out punish-
ment for a broad array of abuses 
ranging as far back as the mas-
sacres of hundreds of thousands 
of people during an anti-commu-
nist purge in 1965 and 1966, when 
Suharto seized power. 

Suharto is accused of abusing 
his power in issuing pre9idential 
decrees that he used to enrich 
himself, his six children and his 

cronies and supporters. 
The attorney general has said 

he expects the investigation to be 
completed and any charges 
brought by Aug. 10. 

But much of Suharto's wealth, 
estimated in the billions or even 
tens of billions of dollars. has so 
far been difficult to trace. Like the 
so-called hidden wealth of former 
President Ferdinand E. Marcos of 
the Philippines, it may never be 
recovered. 

"There are many ways of laun-
dering money: a diplomat said.

Environmentalists Fear Devastation in Siberian Lake 
BAIKALSK, Russia - Near the 

outlet where the Baikalsk Pulp & 
Paper Mill discharges chlorine 
into the world's largest body of 
fresh water, Oleg Dolgov has 
dropped a line to fish. 

Environmentalists accuse the 
mill of polluting Siberia's Lake 
Baikal, a mile-deep cleft that con-
tains one-fifth of the planet 's fresh 
water. Dolgov shrugs off the dan-
ger of contamination. He regularly 
eats what he catches, and has 
never nOllced ill effects. 

"The unemployed come down 
here all the time in the summcr and 
catch fish With nets," Dolgov said. 

Locals may be insouciant, but 
among environmentalists in 
RUSSia and abroad, the mill sym-
bolizes the abuse of an ecological 
treasure. An ulternallonal cam-
paign is seeking to close the plant, 
and Greenpeacc has begun 
nationwide television ads blasting 
the factory But mill management 
says the demands for a completc 
shutdown are blockll1g efforts to 

clean up the plant. 
The issue goes beyond the lake. 

Throughout the former Soviet 
Union, industry has turned the 
waterways into environmental cat-
astrophes. 

The city of Vladivostok pumps 
raw sewage into its bay, the Aral 

selves for the pollution. 
"Unfortunately, Greenpeace 

and all the environmental organi-
zations prevent us from improving 
the environmental situation of the 
lake: said Anatoly Steinberg, mill 
president. 

Baikal is 5,370 feet deep and 

An international campaign is seeking to close the 
plant, and Greenpeace has begun nationwide 
television ads blasting the factory. 

Sea has been gradually emptied 
and polluted by agricultural 
runoff, and the navy dumped 
radioactive waste in to the White 
Sea and the Sea of Japan. 

Environmentalists have long 
had trouble maklllg their case in a 
nation predisposed to heavy 
mdustry. ThiS lime around, the 
Baikalsk mill is attempting to 
blame environmentalists them-

contains 5,500 cubic miles of water. 
Believed to be 25 million years old, 
the lake floor's sediment is 5 miles 
deep. recordlllg eons of life. 

Today Baikal IS filled with rare 
species such as freshwater 
sponges and se:\\s. Sixty percent of 
the lake's life forms are unique, 
biologists say. 

The plant, the backbone of the 
local economy, annually produces 

160,000 metric tons of high-qual-
ity pulp. Some of the chlorine, 
despite filtration, is discharged 
into the lake. But Jennie Sutton, 
an Englishwoman living nearby 
and a leader of a conservation 
group, says the chlorine is con-
verted to deadly dioxins in the 
bodies of seals and other animals. 
Although the pollution is in only 
a tiny part of the lake, the impact 
is disproportionate, she said . 
Animals flock to the warm out-
flow from the mill. 

After years of answering 
reporters' questions and watching 
environmentalists hang banners 
from his mill's smokestacks, 
Steinberg has little pauence for the 
topic of pollution. He insists that 
the mill causes only a minute 
amount of harm that the vast lake 
is capable of handling. "This is the 
best quality of water commg from 
any paper mill m the world: he 
said.

Japan: 
Offer encourages Japanese 
to 'go forth and multipry' 
C . ....... drr... ..... 1 
binhrates that pose many long-
term problems. 

Bandai, which makes Power 
Ranger toys and Tamagotchi elec-
tronic pets. said its incentive was 
intended to help employees defray 
the high cost of raising children and 
to expand the company's shrinking 
customer base - children. 

The offer, which began last 
month, is part of an effort by the 
government and employers to per-
suade the Japanese, who have one 
of the lowest birthrates in the 
world, to go forth and multiply. 
Most initiatives focus on making it 
easier and more economical to 
raise children, extending flexible 
work hours, family leave and child 
care. Some incentives pay cash and 
monthly subsidies. 

"The Japanese government does 
not meddle in a woman's decision 
to have a baby, because that's an 
individual's personal choice: said 
Tomohiro Onishi, deputy director 
of the child-rearing promotion 
division in the Welfare Ministry. 
"But our intention is to reduce 
many of the concerns and hesita-
tions that Japanese people have 
about having children." 

It remains unclear whether 
those efforts will succeed in raising 
the birthrate. Past efforts have had 
scant effect, experts said. 

"1 have to say that what they have 
done so far has not been effective,· 
said Toshinari Ogino, chief 
researcher for the Institute of Labor 
AdmiOlstratlon, a research concern. 

The average birthrate for a 
Japanese woman was 1.38 children 
in 1998, a record low for Japan and 
one of the world's lowest. 

The government wOrries that 
the declinmg birthrate and rapidly 
aging population will stem eco-
nomic growth, because there wlJl 
be fewer workers to support the 
growlllg ranks of the elderly.

SAN FRANCISCO - Breaking 
ranks with the powerful "Wintel 
duopoly,· based on Intel hardware 
and Microsoft software, Gateway 
and America Online plan to 
announce on Tuesday that they 
will . use a processor from an 
upstart Silicon Valley chip maker 
and a version of the Linux operat-
ing system in a new Internet home 
appliance scheduled to go on sale 
later this year. 

The decision is a big victory 
for Transmeta Corp., a chip 
design company in Santa Clara 
that has developed a micro-
processor intended to be a low-
power and inexpensive alternative 
to Intel's microprocessors. 

Transmeta was founded five 

years ago by David Ditzel, the for-
mer Sun Microsystems hardware 
designer, with backing from 
George Soros, the financier; Paul 
Allen , the Microsoft co-founder; 
Deutsche Bank; and others. It said 
last month that it had raised an 
additional $88 million in financing 
from Compaq Computer. Gateway, 
Samsung, Sony and a number of 
Taiwanese manufacturers. 

The deal is a portent of the 
arrival of what is being popularly 
referred to as the post-PC comput-
ing era, a world in which the per-
sonal computer is displaced by an 
expanding array of digital cellular 
phones, personal digital assistants, 
Webpads - which are tablet-style 
computers - and other appliance-

like devices. 
Both Intel and Microsoft have 

largely resisted this vision, main-
taining instead that the PC will 
remain at the center of the com-
puting world for many rears and 
that the new devices wil function 
more or less as peripherals to a 
<.:entral Pc. 

During an antitrust trial, a 
Gateway executive, James Von 
Holle, served as a witness for the 
Justice Department and described 
how Micros.oft had put pressure on 
Gateway after it pursued a strategy 
of installing the Netscape browser 
and placing an AOL icon on the 
desktop of its computers.

Grizzly Bears Poised to Make a Comeback 
From any perspective, the 

remote, rugged country surround-
ing the Bitterroot Mountains in 
western Montana and central 
Idaho appears ideal for grizzly 
bears. Here are the types of terrain 
grizzlies love: alpine meadows; 
pine, cedar and fir forests; glacial 
lakes and fast-running streams 
flowing into lush river valleys. 

Although salmon have declined 
sharply, the roots, berries. nuts. elk, 
deer and insects the giants need to 
fuel their six-month hibernation 
abound. Indeed, hundreds of the 
big bears that the Nez Perce tnbe 
called xaxat roamed this area when 
Lewis and Clark passed through in 
1806, killing seven. In the next 
decades, hundreds of grizzlies fell 
to hunters, with the last recorded 

kill in 1932. Despite several 
exhaustive surveys, no one has seen 

. a grizzly bear III this region for 
more than half a century. 

That situation is about to 
change. This summer, the U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service is expected ~ 
adopt a controversial plan to pitt 
grizzly bears back in the Bitterroot 
region. A 15-member citizen man-
agement committee will be charged 
with finding a way for the bears to 
flourish and coexist with humans, 
particularly those engaged in back-
country recreation , logging, mining 
and ranching. . 

If threatened congressional and 
legal challenges from Idaho do not 
delay the plan from being carried 
out, the management committee 
will complete preparations for the 

arrival of the first bear, in 2002, 
said Dr. Christopher Servheen, 
grizzly bear recovery coordinator 
for the Fish and Wildlife Service, 
based in Missoula, Mont. Over five 
years, at least 25 bears will be 
released in the Bitterroots. Because 
of the grizzly's slow reproductive 
rate, it will take 50 to 110 years for 
the population to reach the pro-
ject's goal of 280 bears. 

Servheen said the reintroduc-
tion was an essential step in ensur-
mg the long-term survival of the 
grizzly in the lower 48 states and its 
removal from the endangered 
species list, where it has been des-
ignated as "threatened" since 1975.

of Conduct as bias-motivated incidents. 

These incidents can create fear and anger in the 
people who are attacked. They can also significantly 
affect the campus climate. Ibrahim and his friends 
were afraid that these messages could escalate into 
action. 

MI was also somewhat fearful: Ibrahim said. "The 
Aryans have a long track record of hating everyone 
who isn't white, from Jews to African Americans sim-
ply beEause they are different. I was fearful that this 
could lead to something worse." 
......... --According to the 1999 version of the UC Annual 
Report and Crime Statistics, there were no bias-
motivated cases reported in 1999 and only one in 
1998. However, according to Adam Jeffers. the pro-
gram coordinator of the Hate-Free Campus 
Campaign in the Student Affirmative Action and 
Human Relations Program, these incidents do occur. 

MI have a folder of complaints from things like 
hate e-mails that students have received, referring to 
particular ethnicities and races, that they don't 
belong here. and that the perpetrator is tired of hear-
ing them cry for what they want, and that they 
should go back to where they came from ." Jeffers 
said. 

The UCSD Principles of Community brochure 
states that as a group, the administration and the 
students at UCSD reject principles of oppression 
and hate: MWe reject acts of discrimination based on 
race, ethnicity, gender, age, disability, sexual orienta-
tion, relision or political beliefs." 

Addinonally, according to the Student Conduct 
Code published by Student Policies and Judicial 

The lJCSD Guardian 

"I was also somewhat fearfuL," 
Ibrahim said. "The Aryans have a 
long track record of hating everyone 
who isn't white, from Jews to African 
Americans simply because they are 
different. I was fearful that this could 
lead to something worse. " 
Affairs Office, the university prohibits the use of 
"fighting words" by students to harass any persons 
on campus or university property. 

Fighting words are defined as "those personally 
abusive epithets which, when directly addressed to 
any ordinary person are, in the context used and as a 
matter of common knowledge, inherently likely to 
provoke a violent reaction whether or not they actu-
ally do." 

According to Jeffers, most bias-motivated II1CI-
dents go unreported. 

"I would estimate that maybe 25 percent of what 
goes on is reported: Jeffers said. "There is a huge 
amount that goes unreported. Hate incidents are 
such a strong thing, yet people may not even realize 
that they have been a victim of something like that. 
They may just internalize it, or just take it.·

Jeffers said that many students believe that inci-
dents like the one involving Muslim students simply 
do not happen at UCSD. Often, we believe that the 
university is a sheltered and academic atmosphere, 
which it may not be. 

According to the Rtvirw of Higher Education , "one

million of these kinds of events" happen each year 
on college campuses arotlnd the United States. 
Similarly, the FBI identifies college campuses and 
schools as the third most common place for hate 
crimes to occur - with 9 percent of all hate U :'lles 
taking place on university campuses. 

People may believe that messages of hate are pro-
tected by the First Amendment. and assert that these 
actions are a case of freedom of speech. However, 
this is untrue. The First Amendment does not pro-
tect "lighting words: that can cause hostile or phys-
ical reactions and violence. This is similar to the 
policies established in the Campus Code of 
Conduct. 

"I think that a lot of people hide behind the First 
Amendment, claiming that they have freedom of 
speech and should be able to say whatever they 
want: Jeffers said. "What [the administration) over-
looks here is that speech usually comes before 
action. Someone says they hate you or says hateful 
things toward you, if it's not challenged, then the 
next step is to do something hateful." 

An example of this occurred during winter quar-
ter of last year. Someone smeared the doorknob of 
the Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Association 
office with dog feces. This happened after the office 
had been targeted by a rash of e-mails that threat-
ened the office and the members of LGBTA.

The Editor's Soapbox' 
Take advantage of this transitory period in your life to ·create an identity that will make you proud 
By JESSICA SCHIPPMANN 
Features Editor 

Get excited, UCSD. 
Take a look around you. For 

most of us, the period between 
graduation from high school and 
graduation from college is the most 
transitory time of our lives. During 
this time, we venture away from 
home to go out and challenge the 
world to meet our needs. 

We are deciding whether we are 
going to face the challenges or play 
it safe, Great achievements usually 
involve great risk and a lot of 
heartache and loss. Although tnese 
changes are consistently stressful 
and challenging, the fact that we 
live up to these cha llenges and 
continue to grow from them is 
important. 

Here is where we shape our 
identity, and it is what we do during 
this time that matters the most. 
Many people try to tell me that I'm 
young and that it doesn't matter if I 
mess up, because there is plenty of 
time to rectify any mishaps, but 
what we do now is shaping the rest 
of our lives. 

Commitment to family and 
lovers vs. our commitment to our 
future and ourselves is shaping the 
course of our lives. Many are 
tempted to give in to the desires or 
wishes of others rather than being 
true to themselves. Sometimes the 
difference is very subtle, like choos-
ing a major because it makes a par-
ent happy. Sometimes it is bigger, 
like choosing a career, life partner 
or religion because it makes a par-

. ent happy. 
Truth be told? There is really 

very little that we can do that will 
make us stand out from the crowd 
in any real sense. Ultimately, what 
you are left with at the end of the 
day is yourself. Everything else will 
eventually resolve itself or just fall 

"away. So what do we do? 
Look around. There are people 

all around us who arc leading by 
example and liv ing life the way they 
truly want to. For some people, thiS 
means disappointing others, but 
ultimately satisfying themselves. 

Maybe it was my friend who 
dropped out of school after fresh-
man year and took a job on a cruise 
ship as a way of seeing the world. 
Rather than staying at a school 
where he was miserable and had no 
idea what he wanted to accomplish 
with his life, he ventured into the 
unknown to take some time off and 
learn a little bit about himself. 

Perhaps it was my friend who 
decided to go to drama school 
rather than college in order to 
become an actress; she is now 
studying Shakespeare at Oxford 
with the recommendation of her 
teacher. 

It's not just the people who 
drop out of school whom we 
should follow. It 's anyone who 
decides to do what they want with-
out letting themselves be influ-
enced by others, or tempted by the 
easy way out. 

It is people like my younger sis-
ter, who has never let anyone tell 
her what to do. At 20 years old, as a 
way of inspiring herself for a swim 
meet, she shaved her head and 
defied the odds in more ways than 
one. ' 

It's people like my dad, who in 

finder 

Look around, There are 
people all around us 
who are leading by 
example by living life 
the way they truly want 
to. For some people, this 
means disappointing 
others, but ultimately 
satisfying themselves. 
between writing memos at work 
and paying tuition checks with the 
greatest of ease, seems to be able to 
leap tall buildings in a si ngle 
bound. Periodically, he likes to take 
breaks from work and stop car 
thieves, or run imponant, revenue-
generating swim meets for teams 
his children no longer swim for. 

In this case, it's the person who 
has lived his life the way he wants 
to, and is now able to enjoy living 
up to the commitments he or she 
has made. Right now, we are creat-
ing pathways in our lives that will 

determine if, in 40 years, we are 
doing what we want with the peo-
ple we love. 

Then there are the people who 
reevaluate their own situation and 
take positive steps to ensure their 
own happiness. 

My roommate, Beth 0' eal 
Arnese, has always loved reading 
and writing, but is a management 
science major because it seemed 
practical. This quarter has been 
spent looking for jobs with compa-
nies all over California. After 
months of interviews, where she 
was listening to her potential 
employers as hard as they were lis-
tening to her, she realized that she 
wasn't where she wanted to be. 
Last week, she decided that she is 
going to do what she wants. Instead 
of graduating this year as planned, 
she will pursue a second major in 
literature/writing. 

After four years, is this an lIct of 
lunacy? Perhaps, but the fact that 
she has the gumption to do right 
by her self, despite what anyone 
else has to say, is an incredible act 
of bravery and a testament to indi-
viduality. 

It's not the people who drop out 
of society that we should respect. 
It's anyone who makes the·decision 
to live life the way he or she wants. 

Like I said, this is a transitory 
period. The people who recognize 
that all they have is a short period 
of time and decide to live life rather 
than simply act as passive partici-
pants are the ones who, for better 
or for worse, seem to get the most 
out of life. 

So what do we do? We decide 
that, no matter what, our only hope 

for a ·successful" life is to live up to 
our own expectations. The most 
famous people are only big for a 
decade or so. After that, they are 
left with themselves, and hopefully, 
their happiness. 

Surrounding yourself with !Jeo-
pie whom you admire, respect and 
love will inspire you to be success-
fulill the goals you create for your-
self. . 

I believe that during this time, it 
isn't the big heart-wrenching dis-
appointments that break youthful 
spirits and that make us cynical. 
Rather, it's the little things that 
insidiously infest optimism, that 
create middle-aged middle man-
agement. 

It 's not the beloved' family 
member's death or the debilitating 
accident that causes us to give up 
on hopes and dreams. These situa-
tions usually force us to face our 
monality, realize that life is short 
and make us stronger and more 
determined. 

It's the little things that get 
inside you, that are internalized 
and begin to break your spirit and 
let you know that you are just one 
liule, tiny voice in a sea of many. 

It's the first speeding ticket you 
get. It's the teacher who won't let 
you make up a midterm even 
though your car broke down and 
you couldn't make it to the exam. 
It's when your computer crashes. 
and you forgot to save your paper. 
It's when we have to buckle down 
and follow ridiculous rules that we 
don't agree with, and that make 
very little sense. It's bureaucracy

A warning to all women who fall 

under this sign: Avoid front-clasping bras 
as your breasts will be conducive to 
abnormal swelling this week. Urges to 
watch Manha Stewan for the first time 
should be satiated as your nunuring side 
kicks into full throttle. Be wary of men 
named Tim or Todd mistaking your kind-
ness for a perverse Oedipal fantasy. 
Nonfat yo~un will lead to unbearable gas 
and constipation. Sorry men, no abnor-
mal swelling for you. 

T_nlS: ... 21...., 21 
The first cybernetic offspring from 

nanotechnology is located somewhere 
between your sixth and seventh vene-
brae, depending on whether you enjoy 
watching old "Matlock" reruns. Their 
purpose is unknown, but have been 
rumored to hold Elvis' dying words. 
Activation will commence this Thursday 
at 2 p.m. with the opening credits of 
"Judge Mathis," whereupon the ultimate 
mystery lies. However, the activation can 
be buffered with a strict diet of Lucky 
Charms, eaten to the cadence of 
"Heartbreak Hotel." Once again, the 
stars save your ass.

After years of disciplined training, you 

have become the highest within your 
~hotokan . Yo~ are honored by 20 genera-
tions of warnor ancestors, guarding your 
soul and pocket change. There is nothing 
to do now, but walt for the impending 
doom from which your greatest enemy 
will rage upon you. Your ultimate worth 
will not be proved on the battleground, 
but the death you choose to take. Fight on, 
brave Gemini!

The lascivious pleasure you have been 

bathing in has finally seeped into the final 
gate of decadence, and the gods can toler-
ate it no longer. If the valet parking wasn't 
bad enough, you suckled ambrosia from 
under their noses which, I personally 
believe, is what truly pissed them off. Your 
only redemption lies in their seduction as 
pantheistic gods have always had a weak-
ness for hedonism. Your only hope is to 
play to every one of their desires, which 
shouldn't be too hard with the practice 
you've had. Success will prove to be the 
most divine upon pleasures. Failure will 
not be described due to its graphic con-
tent, but does involve infinitesimally small 
paper cuts between the index and middle 
fingers.

CGMIa .... ".. ,... • 
Cox, a Revelle senior, said. "If we 
don't address these situations and 
analyze critically, then they 
become tools of oppression, rather 
than empowerment.· 

An example of this occurred 
during winter quarter of this year, 
when Ethnic Studies t B was the 
target of a bias-motivated incident. 
Professor Ruby Tapia and her TAs 
arrived on the dar of the midterm 
in Peterson Hal .to find poems 
posted on every door, condemning 
the class, the teachers and the cur-
riculum. 

"[The poemJ was very long," 
said Laura Barraclough, a 
Marshall senior who worked with 
the depanment after the incident. 
"It was obvious that a lot of work 
had gone into it." 

The poem described the 
authors discontent with the class., 
stating that the class was boring 
and served only to point out how 
the author's ancestors were 
responsible for everything wrong 
with the world. He complained 
that it was required in order to 
graduate, and he resented having 
to tak.e it. The poem also insulted 
the teacher, questioning her com-

petency and individually listed 
each of the TAs and their implied 
faults. 

Tapia used this incident as a 
teaching tool. After the · midterm, 
she read a part of the poem and 
told the students they would dis-
cuss it at their next meeting. Over 
the weekend, a few students wrote 
their own poems in response, in 
support of the class and the cur-
riculum. 

Although ' the department 
never discovered the perpetrators, 
Tapia was very vocal about the 
incident and brought the matter to 
Chancellor Robert Dynes' adviso-
ry committee on diversity. 

"A lot of people were really 
hurt by this,· Barraclough said. 
....... Att8oIIa 

The explosion of the informa-
tion age has made it easier than 
ever for hate groups to dissemi-
nate their information over the 
Internet. 

An e-mail sent to a UCSD stu-
dent earlier this year titled 
"Filipinos ... make me puke," had 
three pans. The first part asked if 
Philipinos could really be classi-
fied as "Asian," the second part 
called young Filipino Americans 
"the disease of society," and the 
third pan was called, "Recognizing 
your roots - A message to 
Filipinos." 

The e-mail stated "The 
Philippines is a third-world coun-

- . . --.... -. .-

program coordinator of the campaign. 
try. Nothing respectable has ever 
been created by Filipino people 
during our entire human history." 

Similarly, the LGBTA is often 
subjected to hate e-mails after 
publicized events, said Scott 
Heath, a Revelle senior who is a 
member of the LGBTA and of the 
Chancellor's advisory committee 
on LGBTA issues. These e-mails 
use expletives and include threats 
of physical beatings. Moreover, 
they stated that LGBT students 
should just leave. Last year, these 
e-mails were fairly regular. 

"After every event, they get 
back negative mail." Heath said, 

"The same person kept e-mailing, 
because announcements were 
going out over student fliers. One 
individual sent thn:e or four mes-
sages every year suggesting the 
beating of LGBT students and 
calling them sick." 

One of these e-mails specifical-
ly threatened LGBTA students_ It 
was sent in response to the 
LGBTA's Gay Jeans Day, that 
requests that all LGBTA students 
wear blue jeans. 

"Beginning Monday, May t t , 
all fruitcakes will be harassed for 
being the freaks of nature that 
they are. Please participate and 
wear your T-shirts saying: 'I'm gay. 
Please beat some sense into me!' 
With your help, we can all work 
out our homophobic anger and 
teach all you log-jammers a lesson 
at the same time,· the email stated. 

Some people falsely believe 
that the Internet provides 
anonymity for individuals who 
want to send messages of hate. 
Often these messages are easily 
traced, how~ver. Nevertheless, for 
the LGBTA, many ofthe people e-
mailing them messages of hate 
rarely bother to try to hide their 
identity. Last year, Heath was a 
specific target for hate mail. 

"It's people like you thaI make 
me sick,· the e-mail stated.

It's more then that, though. It's 
the insidious behavior of others

the sexism, racism, homophobia,

Seven Swimming Seniors Depa1 After Fabulous 2000 Season 
The team's fourth place finish this season was in great part due to the seven leaving UCSD this Spring after graduation 
By TAIT lllUD 
Staff Writer 

It is out of the water and into 
the frying pan for seven members 
of the UCSD men's swimming and 
diving team. 

After helping the Tritons to a 
superlative founh place finish at 
nationals, Jason Boettner, Mark 
Latronica, Matt Macdonald, Mall 
Payne, Ross Russo, Kent Wehde 
and Eric Whalen are all leaving 
UCSD in hopes of excelling some-
where else. 

These seven seniors will be 
sorely missed, as among them are 
two swimmers with times fast 
enough to qualify for the Olympic 
trials, NCAA All-Americans, 
Division III champions, eight pre-
sent or past school record holders 
and one NCAA Division III record 
holder. 

Payne set three of these school 
records and also qualified for the 
Olympic trials in both the 100-
and 200-meter breaststroke. He 
won the Division III chan'lpionship 
for the Tritons in the 100 breast 
and was one of three team cap-
tains. 

"Matt was a great team leader." 
said Head Coach Scott McGihon. 
"He led both by example and 
actions. He was one of the best 
people I have had the chance to 
coach, ever." 

Boettner is an ex-school record 
holder - but who cares about 
school records when you can be an 
All-American in the 200-meter 
backstroke, which he was. He fin-
ished eighth in the event at the 
Division III championships. 
Boettner also played water polo for 
UCSD. 

"Jason was a really versatile 

swimmer," McGihon said. "He also 
did about as good a job splitting 
time between swimming and water 
polo as a guy could do. He is just a 
super worker: 

Macdonald was the Tritons' 
premier diver this year, stepping 
up for the Tritons as he .placed 
third at nationals in the three-
meter height . and was an AII-
American. Macdonald is the old-

est man on the Triton team, 
including the coaches, as he just 
turned 35. 

Russo was a very hard worker

Wehde was another versatile 

member of the Tritons. He trained 
as an individual medley swimmer, 
working on all four strokes. with an 
emphasis on the backstroke, and 
was a team captain. 

"After training the backstroke 
this year we asked Kent to concen-

dinosaur. Because of this, the public is 
unknowin2ly deciding not to be 
informed aoout some of the best athletes 
who do not happen to have the flair that 
other athletes have. 

I feel bad for athletes like Sampras, 
people with class and integrity who 
don't boast of their abilities in order to 
heighten their popularity. 
Unfortunately, in our world, -being a 
self-promoter and selling yourself is 
one way of making your way to the top. 
In an ideal world this wouldn't be true, 
but this isn't an ideal world. 

Until the general public is attracted to 
and intrigued by quiet winners like 
Sampras, these ultimate professionals 
will never be given the respect they 
deserve. 

and qualified for the Olympic trials 10 
both the 1 DO-meter butterfly and 100-
meter backstroke. In addition, he is the 
NCAA Division III record holder in the 
1 OO-meter backstroke. 

MHe is just a great worker for us: 
McGihon said. "He is a great swimmer in 
both the relays and the indiVIdual 
events." 

Every single one of these swimmers 
deserves a standing ovation for the time 
and effon he has put in during his years 
at UCSD. 

Irvin S. Cobb, a sports humorist, said 
it best when he qUipped, "As I under-
stand it, spon is hard work for which you 
do not get paId." 

To all the UCSD swimmers and

you have put 10, and good luck and good

coach Eric Steidlmayer. "He

him play and also when he 
came to practice early every 
day." 

Meyer helped the Tritons 

have a better season than they 
did in 1999, despite losing five 
seniors from that year's 
squad. 

"You are always concerned

Steidlmayer said. "I thought 
that we would be OK with

had some really talented

Meyer certainly did that, 

and with another impressive 
squad coming in next season, 
Steidlmayer should have him-
self a tough team to beat when 
the Tritons move up to

With the jump in competi-

Tennis is a Sport that doesn't 
get much run in this column or 
on most sports talk shows in .this 
area . Despite the fact that tennis 
is the sport in which I spCClalized 
in high school, for some reason 
when it comes time to write 
"Reality Check," I overlook the 
topic of tennis and move on to 
more high-profile sports. I was 
thinking about this the other day, 
and I realized I am as bad as most 
of the sports columnists and com-
mentators whom I bash on a reg-
ular basis in this column. With 
Pete Sampras again losing early in 
the French Open, I felt this was an 
opportunity to give the sport and 
the man the kind of press each 
deserves. 

Despite the fact that some: old-
time sports fans contest the idea 
that Pete Sampras is the best ten-
Ilis player who ever lived, the gen-
eral consensus is that there has 
never been a better athlete In the 
sport. Sampras has amassed the 
most prize money in the history of 
tennis and is one of only five 
Americans to have ever been 
ranked the o. 1 player 10 the 
world. Sampras has also won a 
record number of Grand Slam 
eve:nts and is almost unbeatable 
on grass. He is one of only two 
players to have ever won three 
straight Wimbledon titles and will 
likely go down as the most deco-
rated player in the history of ten-
n.is' most prestigious even His 
accolades make him the Michael 
jordan of professional tennis. 
Despite all his accomplishments, 
he is usually an afterthought 
when people talk about dominant 
figures in sports. 

Why is this? Some people may 
say that Sampras doesn't get the 
run he deserves because of the 
sport he plays. Tennis is generally 
not a hot topic in sports bars. It is 
rarely on television, and when it 
is, it doesn't get the kind of ratings 
other sports get. Despite these 
facts, I don 't think Sampras' lack 
of press is primarily due to the 
sport he plays. Tiger Woods plays 
golf, a sport few watched before 
he came on the scene. Once he 
was there, golf experienced a 
resurgence to popularity levels 
unseen since Arnold Palmer first 
came on the stage more then 30 
years ago. 

Tennis player Andre Agassi is 
another example of somebody who 
is immortalized in the press 
despite playing a sport whose pop-
ularity is not as great as baseball or 
football. 

Agassi has upped his level of 
play in the last couple of years and 
has become Sampras' primary 
adversary, but he certainly has not 
participated with the level of con-
sistency and excellence of 
Sampras. 

Why has Agassi become more 
of an icon than Sampras and 
picked up more endorsement deals 
than his accomplished opponent? 
The reason is Sampras' image and 
the way he goes about his busi-
ness. You never hear about 
Sampras getting into a bar fight 
and stabbing somebody in the heat 
of battle. He doesn't have a differ-
ent girl on his arm every time he is

PORTS 
Crew Loses Four Members 
Despite a lack of pre-college experience, this group of seniors made great contributions 
Sports Editor 

Crew does not get as much 
attention as other SpOrts. There is 
no weekly, prime-time game on 
television like "Monday Night 
Football," and you will not find a 
Sunday afternoon double-header 
like baseball enJoys on cable. 

Despite this, crew members are 
some of the hardest-working ath-
letes around . 

Four such athletes are graduat-
ing from UCSD this june as 
jennifer Green, Paul Dodge, Mark 
Kern and DaVid Tudory will all be 
paddling off into the sunset. 

"Paul has been a very solid 
oarsman for four years," said 
Michael Fillipone, head coach for 
the men's team. "He's a really . 
good guy and he's done a good Job 
for us. We'll miss him: 

Leadership is somethlOg any 
team loses with the departure of a 
senior. This is one of the attributes 
Green always provided. 

"You look up to upperclassmen 
as leaders of the team: women's 
crew Coach Pani Pinkerton said of 
Green. "She's a perfect example of 
why we try to get seniors." . 

Crew is not a big activity at 
most high schools, so recruiting a 
boat is difficult. 

"For crew, I gOt a recruitment 
leaeT: Dodge said. "I had never 
seen it and I never gave it much 
thought. The lener talked about 
hard work and being a pan of a 
team. I had played sportS in high 
school, but I was never really good 
at th'!m. I . thought of this as a 
ch,:'.lIce to compete in a collegiate-
level sport and you did not have to 
be good at it in high school." 

UCSD was lucky when Kern 
decided to come to school in La 
jolla in his junior year. 

"Mark was a transfer: Fillipone 
said. "He came in with a very solid 
rowing background. He made a 
great impact." 

Kern came from Orange Coast 

College, where he raced for two 
years. 

~My brother did it for a while," 
Kern said. "He did pretty well. It's a 
pretty competitive sport." 

Like Kern, this was Green's first 
year on the team. Despite the short 
time she spent with the Tritons her 
contribution was great. 

"She's a junior college transfer," 
Pinkerton said. "During her junior 
year she was sick, so during her 
senior year she gave it a try: 

Tudory joined the team after 
spending time on the water polo 
and swim teams. 

"He's a very good oarsman: 
Fillipone said. "What he did was 
exceptional. He had a big impact. 
His cardiovascular [conditioning) 
from swimming helped him out." 

In Green, there was a combina-
tion of exceptional height, ani tude 
and leadership. 

"She's a tall girl. Because we are 
sort of restarting this year, we were 
aggressive in our recruiting. We 
wanted tall girls," Pinkerton said. 

"Without a true varsity, she pro-
vided a lot of leadership: he added. 
• ormally, your varsity would be 
big enough to lead the team. This 
year our novice is bigger. Socially, 
she provided a lot of opportunities." 

San Diego draws many people 
for many reasons. 

" I went to hi~h school in Las 
Vegas," Dodge said. "' was unsure 
of my career field. I decided that I 
wanted to go to a large state univer-
sity. I wanted a school with a num-
ber of things going on. The weath-
er is great, it's not too far away from 
Las Vegas and I have family here." 

Most athletes that leave UCSD 
have officially ended their athletic 
careers. For members of the team, 
however, there are a few opportu-
nities after graduation. 

"I'd like to row with the San 
Diego Row Club," Dodge said. 
"They have different levels. 
Hopefully I can afford it. That's the 
only option for rowing in the 
future. There arc alumni boats, but

nothing really serious.· 

Although most athletes look 
back at their career as a whole in a 
positive manner, many athletes 
feel that their senior year stands 
out above the rest. 

"This year was one of my 
favorite years of my four y~rs of 
rowing.· Kern said. "We had a fast 
boat. Michael Fillipone challenged 
me more that any coach ever has, 
both physically and mentally. He 
definitely prepared us for the last 
race of the season." 

Camaraderie was a big part of 

the rowing squad. 
"A large group of guys had never 

picked up an oar before; Dodge 
said. "It was an opponunity to Jearn 
something new with people who 
were in the same boat as me. It was 
the best decision in my lift so far." 

Both the men's and women's 
rowing teams hope to be successful 
in the ti.ature. but they wiU have to 
go about it without some fine ath-
letes. 

"They all did a pt job,· 
Fillipone said. "What they did this 
year was remarkable.· 

Tennis Stars Shine at NCAA Nationals 
Lyndsey Tadlock, Amy Tranckino and Michael Meyer represent UCSD in individual tournaments 

Sports Editor 

The regular season is over for 
both men's and women's tennis, 
but the standouts on both teams 
were invited to the NCAA 
Division III National 
Championships to compete for 
individual national titles last week. 
For the women, Amy Tranckino 
made it t the semifinals in the sin-
gles bracket while Tranckino and 
Lyndsey Tadlock were eliminated 
in the semifinals of the doubles 
competition. For the men, Michael 
Meyer was eliminated in the first 
round of the singles competition 
by Sloan Rush, who was the even-
tual runner-up in the tournament. 

In singles competition, second-
seed Tranckino won her first two 
rounds to put her into the quar-
terfinals. In her first-round 
match up, Ttanckino had little 
trouble in the first set' against 
Ellen Anderson of Gustavus 
Adolphus Colle~e. Tranckino 
broke Anderson 5 serve three 
times in the set and rolled to-a 6-0 
win. The second set was an entire-
ly different story. The two com-

petitors battled for 12 grueling 
games and when there was still 
nothing separating them, they 
played a tic-breaker to decide the 
winner. The score in the tie-break-
er was tied at five before 
Tranckino won the next 
two points and the 
match. 

The second 
round was a dogfight 
for 1ranckino, who 
played Erin Eggers from 
Washin$ton and Lee 
University. The first set was a 
tightly conteste~ affair with 
Tranckino emerging the 6-3 vic-
tor. The second set was a 180 
degree turn from the first. Eggers 
came out crushing ground strokes 
and serves and blew 1ranckino off 
the court. Eggers took the set 6-0 
and sent the match to a third and 
deciding set. 

Under the pressure, Tranckino 
excelled. Despite being a fresh-
man, Ttanckino focused and 
emerged victorious by a score of 
6-2 and, as a result, found herself 
in the quanerfinals against Karen 
Lui of the University of Chicago. 

Ttanckino won the quarterfinal 

match 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 to advance to 
the semifinals, where she faced 
Jaime Cohen of Amherst 
University. 

Tranckino had defeated 
Cohen, the tournament's 

third-seeded player, in 
the team competition, 

but ran into trouble 
this time around. 

Tranckino was domi-
nated in the first set 

and lost 2-6 before win-
ning the second set 7-5 to 

set up a winner-take-all third 
set. The fact that Tranckino had 
already played five sets that . .day 
may have affected her play, 
because Tranckino faded late and 
lost the set 4-6 to be eliminated 
from the tournament. 

In the doubles bracket, 
Tranckino teamed up with 
Tadlock to form the tournament's 
third-seeded team. In the first 
round, the duo defeated Kristin 
Janese and Kristin Grosso from 
Cortland State 6-3, 6-2 to gain a 
birth in the quarterfinals. 

Once there, they confronted 
Meghan and Kristin Donley from 
Gustav.us Adolphus College. The 

first set was a whitewash of Triton 
winners. Tadlock and Tranckino 
dominated the Donley sisters and 
won the set 6-1. After losing the 
second set in a tie-breaker, 
Tadlock and Tranckino were back 
to their winning ways. dominating 
the competition and cscapinJ with 
a 6-2 third set victol)' to WIn the 
match and advance to the semifi-
nals. Despite losing to Brook 
Hartzell and Melissa Harley from 
Washington and Lee University 
(VA) 6-2,5-7, 1-6, the duo's per-
formance was truly impressive. 

In the men's competition, 
Meyer had • hard time with Rush, 
Trinity College's No. 1 siogIcs 
player. Meyer delated Rush earli-
er this season but this time around 
Rush got the better of him, win-
ning the match 6-4, 6-2. Despite 
losing the match, Meyer was 
named the West Rookie Regional 
Player of the Year. Meyer, only a 
freshman, led the Tritons this year 
and amassed an impressive 11-4 
record in singles play. 

"I knew that he would be a 
good player." said men's head
