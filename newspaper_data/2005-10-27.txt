battle over 

booze

Staff Writer 
Earlier this chool yea r, a com-

mittee exploring the undergradu-
ate student experience reccom-
mended more events that involve 
alcohol to , among other reasons, 
improve campus life. 

T he idea runs counter to sev-
eral campus entities, who are still 
continuing efforts of drinking 
awareness and prevention. 

The recommendation for more 
sanctioned alcohol events was 
made to improve the undergradu-
ate,committeemember and CSD 
Director of Regional Development

Council 
clamps 

down on 
SRTV 
By MAn L'HEUREUX 

Senior Staff Writer 

In response to the Oct. 20 air-
ing of a second pornographic seg-
ment aired by John Muir College 
enior teve York, the A.S. Council 

has approved an amendment to the 
Student-Run Television charter that 
blocking pornographic images from 
being aired on SRTV at all times, 

The amendment was first pro-
posed by ,. Commi~sioner of 
Student ervice Maurice Junious 
on Oct. 5, but the council effective\v 
rejected the provi ion. I I owever, i~ 
light of alleged threats from cam-
pus admini~trators ref.ra rding the 
futu re of SRTV, the council decided 
to recon ider its options with how 
it treats its media service, accord-

"It's a signa l from the institu-
tion that having a little fun and 
relaxjng in a ocial anno phere is 
part of college life," she said. "It 
was also determined that, by hav-
ing a strict 'no alcohol' policy. we 
risk ending a message to students 
that we don't trust them to be 
adults who are learning about life 
and learning to make their own 
decisions and - frankly - mis-
takes. " 

The committee's suggestion 
butts heads to the UCSD's alco-
hol awareness message, supplied 
by the Community Collegiate 
Alcohol Awareness and Prevention 
program, which is associated with 
San Diego State University. 

Faculty call a time--out on athletic scholarships 
Plan would pay each qualified student-athlete about $500 

"I still think that as a 'culture,' 
especially on college campuses, we 
sti ll imply that the only way stu-
dents will have fun is by supplying 
alcohol and that is the message we 
need to get away from," sa id Lupe 
Samaniego-Kraus, a member of 
the program's steering committee 
and C D repre entative. 

llowever, student experience 
committeee members found that 
the majority of the students felt dif-
ferently about drinking. Previous 
campus events that served alcohol, 
such as "Thank God It's Friday" 
concerts, fostered a bond between 
undergraduates, but still sent a 
positive university message to the 
student body, Bezzerides said.

A committee of the Academic 
Senate will mull a proposal that, 
if passed, will grant $300,000 in 
scholarships for CAA student-
athletes. On Oct. 25, the enate 
unanimously voted to allow an 
appointed group to revise the pro-
posal, first introduced in spring 
2005 by Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Joseph W . Watson. 

Approval of the proposal, 
which would allocate about $500 
from registration fee reserves 
for each athlete in grants-in-aid, 
would enable UCSD to attempt 
to match itself with other Division 
II universities for recruitment 
purposes, according to Assistant 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Edward J. Spriggs. The approxi-
mate award to each student athlete 
would be $500.

However, John Muir College 
freshman Alan J. Maulhardt, a 
member of the UCSD basket-
ball team, said the proposal would 
have little impact on students. 

"I don't think it will help 
recruiting at all," he said. "Five 
hundred dollars i not going to 
convince anyone compared to the 

18,000 that other chools offer. 
That was one of the reasons I 
almost didn 't come here." 

The grants-in -a id proposal was 
originally postponed at a pring 
meeting of the Academic Senate, 
when members decided that a 
small igroup would work to revise 
the proposal over the summer, 
according to Senate Chair Jean-
Bernard Minster. Although the 
committee did meet once over the 
summer, it was not able to fully 
modify the proposal, and will con-
tinue its discussions on Oct. 28. 

Currently, the NCAA requires 
that all Division n schools offer 
at least $250,000 for grants-in-
aid, and UCSD remains one of 
the largest schools in the division 
that does not offer the minimum 
amount, according to Watson. 
Last year, Watson received a 
waiver from the requirement for 
the 2005-06 academic year from 
the NCAA, but he predicted at the 
spring meeting that the possibility 
of a perpetual waiver, similar to 
one given Ivy League Division II 
schools, is very low. 

The Graduate Student 
Association is concerned that the

amount ot money appropnated tor 
athletics would have to increase if 
NCM standards were altered in 
the future, according to former 
GSA President Laura Kwinn. 

The plan proposes that, over a 
period of time, enrollment growth 
provide permanent funding. The 
GSA had opposed the proposal 
last spring, questioning the stabil-
ity of enrollment. 

"The current proposal takes 
funds from registration fee reserves 
and savings, and plan to take fur-
ther funds from the increase in 
enrollment in the coming years," 

K.wmn sal(1 at the spnng meeong. 
"What will happen when enroll-
ment levels off? What will happen 
when the NCAA increases the 
scholarship requirement? We fear 
that without more open dialogue, 
students will be required to pay 
much more than they currently 
intend for the development of ath-
letics on the campus." 

In addition, graduate tudents 
are being undercut in the pro-
posal's decision-making process, 
Kwinn said.

UCSD ph~sicists

Several hundred physicists

opposition to a U.s. Department 
of Defense proposal that would 
give the United States the right 
to use nuclear weapons against 
other nations that don't possess 
them. according to a UCSD press 
release. 

The movement is spearheaded 
by a petition begun by two UCSD 
physics professors. Kim Griest and 
Jorge Hirsch. 

"We point out in the petition 
that nuclear weapons are on a

other weapons of mass destruction 
and conventional weapons and 
that the underlying principle of the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is 
that, in €!(change for other coun-

of lIuclear weapons. the nuclear 
weapon states will pursue nuclear

The reasons given for the gov-

Students participating in the

The chat, held on Sept. 29. gave 
students the chance to interact

but the reality is that such programs 
cannot be fully funded at this lime. 
We will be looking for private sector

I A.S. COUNCIL AT A GLANCE SRTV: Senators challenge decision's legality 
A.S. Meeting .10 - Oct. 26 

Public Input 
• John Muir CoDege Student 

Advocate Pat Allen announced his 
disappointment with the council's 
decision to pass legislation to 
"severely limit" the artistic free-
doms and creativity of students. 

He referred to legislation passed 
during a Oct. 23 special meet-
ing during which senators passed 
amendments to the Student-Run 
Television charter. The meeting, 
he said, was inadequately publi-
cized. The meeting was eventually 
declared unconstitutional. 

-This act is the ultimate act of 
cowardice," Allen said. "I hope 
that, as a student of UCSD, that 
this council wi~~::r to the job 
which it was . and make 
decisions in the belt.iDterest of the 
students it represents." 

• SRlV Station Co-manager 
Tiffany Rapp defended the sta-
tion, explaining that it offen a 
variety of opportunities for stu-
dents interested in television pro-
duction. 

In light of the recent con-
troversy over its pornographic 
broadast, she said that it was 
her "highest priority to uphold 
the creative rights and liberties 
of students." She also said that 
SRlV has received no e-mails or 
complaints regarding the content 
of its broadcasts. 

Items of Immediate 
Consideration 

nudity at any time," proposed and 
passed by the council at a spe-
cial meeting convened on Oct. 
23, was rescinded by submitter 
Christopher Sweeten. 

However, the item was recon-
sidered in a 19-5-0 vote, and ulti-
mately passed in a 14-8-2 vote. 

ItemB 
Another amendment to the 

SRTV charter that passed on Oct. 
23, which would affix a March 8, 
2006 apiration date on the char-
ter itself, was also reconsidered 
and passed by consensus. 

Items of Immediate 
Consideration 
ItemC 

Senaron did not challenge a 
finance committee recommen-
dation to approve an additional 
$1,259 from its general unallocated 
funds to the All-Campus Transfer 
Association, despite criticism by 
Sinh CoDege Senior Senator Matt 
Corrales. The original legislation 
asked for $5,190 but was pared 
down in committee. 

"I think it's fiscally irresponsi-
ble to put more money to it before 
it's spent," Corrales said. 

coruinwtd from page I 
ing to A.S. President Christopher 
Sweeten. In an Oct. 23 emergency 
council meeting, the A.S. Council 
approved the amendment, which 
bans "graphic depiction of sexual 
activity inwlving nudity" at any 
time, in a 12-5-0 vote. 

"I had to stop the administra-
tion from physically shutting down 
SRlV," Sweeten said at the Oct. 
23 meeting. "There is no doubt 
that A.S. needs to intervene in this 
matter." 

York became a subject of con-
troversy last spring after a segment 
ofhis Koala 1V show depicted him 
engaging in sexual activities with 
an unidentified woman. According 
to York's Web site, this latest video 
was made to determine if"freedorn

According to Sweeten, the sirnuI-

"a breach of federal law that could 
put [A.S.] in legal jeopardy."

the actions of their own station," 
Thurgood Marshall Senior Senator 
Kate Pil10n said. 

Some solutions proposed at the 
meeting included firing the sta-
tion's management, freezing SRlV 
funds, temporarily discontinuing 
Internet broadcasts, and introduc-
ing legislation to ban "Koala TV" 
from airing. Only two items were 
ultimately proposed for action at 
the meeting, and the charter revi-
sion that prevented nudity was the 
sole motion to pass, in a 12-5-0 
vote. Councilmembers were highly 
concerned about whether or not 
they had the legal right to regulate 
the station's contenL 

"We were infonned that it 
might be illegal to add the amend-
ment [banning nudityl," Eleanor 
Roosevelt College Senior Senator 
Ashton lranfar stated. 

Other counciImembers felt con-
fident in regulating SRlV content, 
since the council had already con-
sulted the caIDpus attorney on the 
legal ramifications of imposing the 
amendment. 

"The only real lawyers that have 
looUd at this have told us that add-
ing [the amendment] is acceptable," 
Pil10n said. 

The motivation behind the 
amendment itself was called into 
question at the Oct. 26 council 
meeting, where several senators 
and members of the public spoke of 
the dangers of "administrative pres-
sure" influencing council decisions. 

"If you support the banning 
porn on SRlV due to principle, 
then [ encourage you to vote to 
support [the amendmentl," A.S. 
Vice President of Academic AffiUrs 
Harry Khanna said. "If you voted 
for it because you are afraid the 
administration is going to padlock 
the doors, then I urge you to recon-
sider." 

However, several councilmem-
bers rejected the notion that pres-

thursday 

sure was driving their decisions at 
the Oct. 23 meeting. 

"I would hope that we would 
never bend down to administrative 
pressure," Pillon said. 

For others, the content of broad-
cast material was not the primary 
concern of the matter. 

"You can't win here," said York, 
addressing councilmembers at the 
Oct. 26 meeting. "The main point 
I am making is that students need 
control of their own govemmenL 
If you don't step in, the administra-
tion will step in for you." 

Some councilmembers at the 
most recent session, however, did 
not see the debate as a fight for free 
speech, but instead as a battle of 
parliament2l'y politics. 

"This is not an iSSUe of free 
speech," John Muir College 
Council Chair Neil Spears said. 
"This is an issue of A.S. members 
imposing their own personal beliefs 
on the public and that is not accept-
able by any means." 

The council successfully passed 
a motion to reconsider the amend-
ment on Oct. 26, but it was again 
voted through by an 14-8-2 vote. 
There was a discrepancy regarding 
whether or not a majority or a two-
thirds majority vote was necessary 
to amend the chaner, but Fomero 
ruled that :I majority vote was 
A.S. precedent and therefore was 
sufficient for the motion to pass. 
According to Tess, a disclaimer has 
since been added to the SRlV 
Web site warning of the possibil-
ity of pornographic images being 
broadcasL The council postponed 
until next week a seperate resolu-
tion, which would forbid the station 
from airing all live programs and 
demanding that the station's legal 
counsel meet with the student gov-
ernment and university lawyers.

SR TV nudity debacle 
requires prudence 

W th John Muir Coll ege senior Steve York at 
hi televi ed antics yet 
again, everyone charged 
with med iating the latest 
conflict between Student-
Run Television, the A.S. 
Coun ci l and the campus 
administratio n must first 
take a deep breath and step 
back. Most importantly, 
they must keep their egos 
from standing in the way 
of a satisfactory solution to 
the controversy. 

Unfortunately, that 
doesn't seem to be happen-
ing. By voting to remsert 
the provision prollibiting 
all grapllic sexual nudity 
on SRTV, the A.S. Council 
may have closed a door that 
cannot be reopened. 

It's obvious that pride 
is affecting policy. Vice 
Chancellor of . Student 
Affairs Joseph W. Watson 
burned rus hand by giving 
SRTV an ultimatum less 
than a week before the 
newest _pornography was 
aired. Will he stick by his ' 
heavy-handed promise to 
shut down the station now 

that it's defied him by airing 
nudity? It would be best If 
he didn 't. Under the pro-
vision of SRTV's charter, 
this incident necessitates a 
meeting with station direc-
tors and the A.S. Council to 
resolve the conflict - not 
wlilateral action by either 
Watson or the council. 

The A.S. Council wields 
much power in this conflict, 
but so far, its members have 
been overly reactionary. 
First, they arranged a hasty 
- and apparently unconsti-
tutional - meetrng on Oct. 
23, passing several changes to 
the SRTV charter and rules 
and reguJations, despite the 
fact that the current char-
ter requires the aforemen-
tioned meeting. SecondJy, 
the council 's rUling to ban 
graphic nudity has opened 
me student government up 
to inevitable legaJ ramifica-
tions, for wruch students' 
fees will eventually pay. 

Those char.,ged with 
responding to this conflict 
must act decisively, but not 
in a way that violates proce-
dure or causes this battle of 
egos escalate. 

Sex offenders should be 
imprisoned, not isolated 
T here's a rule of mwnb i~ California p?li-tIcs: When polling 
low or otherwise in doubt, 
go after the sex offenders. 
Perhaps thjs is why Gov. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger has 
thrown rus support behind 
an Orwellian ballot initiative, 
expected to :lppear on the 
ballot next year, that would 
tag convicted offenders with 
satellite tracking devices. 

But those who value 
liberty have reason to 
worry now. Under a law 
Schwarzenegger signed this 
year, sex offenders will be 
banned from living within 
half a mile of any school. 
Though perhaps common-
sensical in theory, the new 
statutes may have devastat-
ing effects. 

As mental healm experts 
have pointed out, the law is 
deeply problematic: An over-
whelnung proportion of sex 
crimes occur wiiliin families, 
not among trangersj because 
offenders are unlikely to tar-

get random students, the 
resmctions are unnecessary 
and excessive. 

AnaJyses by two papers 
predict that the law would 
make most of urban Los 
Angeles and Sacramento 
uninhabitable to convicted 
offenders. In effect, California 
has decided to relocate its 
undesirables to the modern 
equivalent of leper colonies, 
away from jobs mat would 
again make them productive 
members of society. 

If sex offenders are truly 
incapable of rehabilitation, 
they should be placed in 
protective custody in men-
tal institutions - where our 
society sends those inca-
pable of operatin~ by its 
rules. For California, which 
is unwilling to bear such 
costs, the solution has been 
justice on the cheap. 

For now, the law affects 
just 1,000 Californians. 
When basic rights must be 
sacrificed, mough, it's 1,000 
too many.

Supreme Court nominee lacks 
proper background and know--how 

By NMASHA NAltAGHI 
Contributing Writer 

Brain surgery requires a thorough and compre-hensive understanding of the innermost work-ings of the brain to ensure a successful opera-
tion. Judicial review demands an equally expansive 
knowledge of constitutional law in order for one to 
adequately comply with the demands of the profession. 
Harriet Miers does not have the experience to be either 
a brain surgeon or an associate justice on me Supreme 
Court. 

And yet, President George W . Bush selected Miers 
- the current White House counsel - to replace 
retiring Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Her 
nomination is an insult to the American people and 
cheapens the nation's instirution of justice. And, of 
course, it is also feeding extensive antagonism on 
Capitoillill over the issue. 

The politicians who oppose the Miers nomination, 
including many conservatives, regard her severe lack 
of qualifications and her considerable ties to both the 
current Bush adnUnistr.ltion and the president himself 
as reason enough for worry. "She needs more than 
murder boards. She needs a crash course in constitu-
tional law," Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) told the Ntw 
York Times. 

If nominated, Miers would become the onJy current 
justice on the Supreme Court with no judicial experi-
ence. Moreover, she would be the first justice in over 
30 years to come to the court without previous judicial 
experience. Her history with the Bush administration, 
m.e only experience the president advertises about his 
nominee, leaves many curious as to what role her bias 
will play in her career as an associate justice, if selected. 

From January 2001 to June 2003, Miers worked as 
a staff secretary for the White House, later occupying 
the position of deputy chief of staff for policy until 
February 2005, again at me White House. Following 
that position, Miers acted as counsel to the president 
until her recent nomination. 

Her history with Bush, however, began long before 
her work in the White House, when she acted as Busb's 

personal lawyer. 
In the 57-page survey for the Senate Judiciary 

Comntittee, when asked to "identify the categories 
of litigation .. . that [were] lileely to present potential 
conflicts of interest during [her] initial service," and to 
explain how she would handle such conflicts, Miers' 
response was worrisome and inadequate. She wholly 
failed to identify the areas where conflict might arise 
and simply circumvented the question by patrioticaUy 
proclaiming that she "would resolve any potential con-
flict of interest by abiding by both the spirit and the 
letter of the law." 

Patriotism aside, however, previous statements -
or rather lack thereof - throw into doubt her ability 
to abide by the "spirit and the letter of the law," as she 
so vapidly stated. When asked by the press if she would 
recuse herself from cases concerning issues where she 
might exhibit bias due to her history with the Bush 
administration, Miers declined to answer. 

Until the administration resolves the f.trce that is 
the Miers nomination, the White House will continue 
to acquire enemies by making a mockery of the judi-
cial system; first by Bush with his choice of nominee, 
and then by Miers' insufficient and almost laughable 
response to the Senate survey. The nonchalant and 
distasteful manner in which she created the American 
system of justice proves that she is unqualified for such 
a high position of authority. 

As in the survey, the Senate asked Miers to "indicate 
the percentages" of her appearances in federal courts, 
state courts and other courts. To this, the mathematics 
major from Southern Methodist University replied: 
"While it is difficult to approximate tbae pera:nt-
ages, I had cases in both the federal and ,state courts. 
My work was not trial intensive due ro its nature, but 
I tried cases and argued appeals in both federal and 
state courts." Of aU the nominees to complete a survey 
of this nature, a mathematics major should bave the 
fewest problems estimating the percentages requested 
by the Senate. 

Some opponents raise other questions about her

Alternative, Web media press improvement 
upon San Diego's conservative print dinosaur 
lines in 
the sand 

Ian S. Port 

I like ro thinle that most people in San Diego read the Union-Tribune grudgingly. They 
ought to. . 

Long before [ became an 
intern for one of its competitors, 
the lack of passionate journal-
ism in the U-T was clear to me 
from what a r.hore most of its 
pages were (and are) to read. 
With a news section that's mostly 
wire stories, and a conservative 
outlook that often seems ro caSt 
any controversy in a clumsy dia-
lectic, the paper has never had 
a national reputation for great 
reporting. It has certainly never 
won a Pulitzer. 

When San Diego was malc:ing 
the series of disastrous decisions 
that have made the city finances 
suffer from their current malaise, 
the U-T was reporting on City 
Hall only minimally. 

But these days, something is 
happening at the U-T. Slowly but 
surely, it is getting better. 

Blame it on competition. Not 
from TV - did you thinle this 
was England? - but from other 
print sources. CityBeal, the Read" 
and, of course, VoiceojSa1lDiego. 
arg, a nonprofit local news Web 
site launched in February. It was 
as an intern for them last summer 
that I was shoved into San Diego 
politics. 

And having another source 
of sharp reporting on City Hall 
- the bread and butter of Voice's 
daily content - has made quite 
a difference, both for voters and 
followers of local politics and for 
the major local print institution, 
who suddenly faces another dog 
on a big-deal beat. 

Voice is a very long way from 
having the readership, pres-
ence or crispness of the U-T. 
Economically, there's no competi-
tion: the U-Ts non-news sections 
are not so bad, and most people 
who get the paper just read those, 
anyway. But in the meat-and-
potatoes reporting arena, Voice is 
often giving the U-T a serious run 
for its money by telling stories 
that an entrenched conservative 
mainstay cannot. 

Take the much-discussed City 
Council meetings. Whereas the 
U-T usually repons merely the 
outcome of the 
marathon cynicism-
breedingtorrureses-

" 

out of the Republican bacle pocleet 
it was once buried in. 

To some extent, anyway. 
While the news pages of the U-
T doggedly covered the Dulee 
Cunningham scandal (in which 
the local Republican Congressman 
was found to have personal finan-
cial ties with a defense contractor 
he worked with), and seems to be 
improving its worle on the mayoral 
race, its impartiality has not been 
continued on the opinion pages. 

Columnist James 
Goldsborough, for years one of 
the only liberal voices on the 

sions, Voice writers 
have written freely 
about the feel and 
mood of the room, 
adding colorful 
details of quintes-
sentially colorful 
local politicians 
like City Attorney 
Mike Aguirre. It's 
a different style of 
reporting, one that 
seems to jibe better 
with today's blog-
ger-friendly media 
consumers than 
the old hard-news 
straightjacket. 

... Voice [of San 
Die~] is often giving 
the Union, Tribune

Arguably the 
father of San 
Diego journal-
ism, Neil Morgan 
was a columnist 
and editor at the 
Evrning Tribune, 
once one of San 

conservative 
. " mamstay cannot. 

But the U-Ts biggest prob-
lem historically isn't writing 
quality: It's that its publishers' 
conservative outlook has directly 
influenced what the paper would 
print on both its news and opin-
ion pages. Republican politi-
cians like wet noodle ex-mayor 
Dick Murphy (and, dare I say, 
Jerry Sanders?) can still count on 
the paper for a soft account of 
any slip-up , and that's actually 
an improvement over the past. 
According ro two articles run by 
the Los Angtles Times ear/ier this 
month on the paper's publisher 
and its future , the still-staunchly-
rightist paper has recently stepped 

Diego's twO 
papers, for 50 years. When the 
Union and the Tribune merged 
in 1992, Morgan continued as a 
columnist until he was fired in 
2004. 

Morgan went on to help found 
Voice of San Diego, for which 
Goldsborough now writes a 
monthly column. His last, enti-
tled, "Union-Tribune still failing 
San Diego," gives a more weighty 
account of the paper's infirmities 
than I ca n. 

"Its opinion pages are biased 
to a degree rarely found in gener-
al circulation newspapers today," 
Goldsborough wrote. " Union-
Tribune editorials, which sup-

ported Cunningham for a decade, 
simply can't accept that the top-
gunner from Rancho Santa Fe, 
who never met a defense contrac-
tor he couldn 't do business with, 
was on the take." 

So it won't surprise anyone 
when the U-T endorses Sanders 
to be the next mayor of San 
Diego. They haven't yet. But 
what do you think they're going 
to do, endorse the activist-envi-
ronmentalist? T he paper that has 
still never printed an unfriendly 
word about downtown business 
interests and only a few about the 
politicians they own? 

Because of its nonprofit status, 
Voice cannot endorse any can-
didates. In that arena, the U-T 
is alone to malee itself look fool-
ish - although at this point it's 
hard to tell how many unmade 
minds there are about whom to 
vore for. 

One thing is for sure: with a 
fresh battery of younger, lean-
er competition, the U-T is very 
quickly revealing itself to be the 
broken record it has been for 
decades. Irs local news pages must 
stay alive if the paper wishes to 
keep its audience - especially in 
times like these - and it appears 
to have realized that. 

Whether its editoria l pages 
will ever unfreeze a bit remains 
quite uncertain. Rumor has it that 
Copley, who's never been partic-
ularly enthusiastic about running 
the newspaper empire his mother 
handed him (one of America 's last 
family-run ones), might sell me 
paper within the next few months. 
That would probably lead to quite 
an upheaval at the old U- T. So 
keep your fingers crossed.

Court: Miers'

evasl veness 
shows she's a 
bad choice 

conlinued from page 4 
ability ro separate church and state 
as a justice and , while these doubts 
are far less substantial than her lack 
of qualifications, they ra ise a va lid 
concern only because her religiolJS 
affiliation acts as the cmx of BlJSh's 
reasoning for her nomination. 

"People ask me why J picked 
Harriet Miers," Bush said to report-
ers regarding the nomination. 
"They want to know Harriet Miers' 
background .... And part of H arriet 
Miers' Ii fe is her religion." 

Miers' religious beliefs should be 
separate from any of the reasoning 
behind Bush's selection; yet they 
are the very grounds he emphasizes. 
Considering the vast assortment 
of choices Bush had in selecting a 
nominee for the Supreme Court, 
his decision was both careless and a 
seeming case of cronyi m. 

For example, Janice R. Brown 
provides a strikingly extensive 
background in judicial law, having 
served nine years as a California 
Supreme Court judge and now sits 
on the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
the District of Columbia. Edith 
Brown Clement and Emilio Garza, 
both judges for the 5th Circuit U.S. 
Court of Appeals, also demonstrate 
a greater background in judicial law 
than Miers. Yet the president madc 
a poor choice, as though there was 
some penury of selections. 

With an abundance of votes 
already against her, that Miers will 
take a seat in the nation's highest 
court seems - thankfully - high-
ly unlikely. Nonetheles , the upsct 
grows steadily. Outcries agai nst the 
president will surely come to a 
head at the Senate confirma tion 
hearings beginning ov. 7 and 
will do more than simply fault the 
president for his blatant abuse of 
power and his attempt ro furth er 
cronyism in an already troubled 
administration .

. Alcohol: Binge drinking cited as problem for students Athletics: 
Proposal

student life 

continued from page I 
fond memories of the famed 
"TG's" that were held on cam-
pus," Bezzerides said. "Honestly, 
it was not solely because there was 
alcohol there. It created a sense of 
community. It was something to 
which you looked forward as you 
slogged through midterms." 

In addition, the student satis-
faction committee suggested that 
having such events would create a 
stronger alumni base, as students 
could recall better college experi-
ences after graduation. 

"If [alcohol) is on campus, it 
allows a setting for students to 
be able to do some more social 
activities on campus rather than 
off campus, and thus being able 
to see the univer ity as more than 
just school, but also as a social 
setting," Sixth College commit-
tee representative junior Enrique 
Soto said. "I think it is more 
convenient to have a bter after 
class and socialize on campus than 
driving off campus to a bar." 

Campus activities can sti ll be 
memorable without alcohol, said 
Samaniego-Kraus. A key part of 
CCAAP's environmental strategy 
involves promoting the alcohol-
free college activities, movies, 
concerts and the more than 300 
student organizations in which 
students can get involved. 

"A lot of students ay that they 
drink because there's nothing else 
to do," Samaniego-Kraus said. 
"It's our aim to show them that 
there are other activities and fun 
things they can do." 

CCAAP employs several 
important partnerships, especially 
with campus law enforcement offi-
cials, according to UCSD Police 
Department Cpl. Doug O'Dell. 

"We look at our role here as a 
pannership with the organizer to 
ensure that they have safe events, 

that patrons have a good time and 
are afe - and prevent things 
from going wrong," O'Dell said. 
"We don't look at it as a chance 
to make arrests for the sake of 
making arrests." 

Samaniego-Kraus said that 
while she would not call alco-
hol a "major problem" at UCSD, 
CCAAP is concerned with con-
sequences like alcohol poisoning, 
sexual assaults and drum driving. 
Six cases of alcohol poisoning 
were documented at la st year's 
Sun God festival, 
she said, a relatively 
low number. 

However, alco-

" 

or more drinks for men in one sit-
ting, Samaniego-Kraus said. 

"One of the things we've 
learned through surveys is that 
many students admitted to, after 
drinking, driving or getting into 
a car with someone who has been 
drinking," she said. 

The surveys were administered 
through the Prevention Research 
Center at UC Berkeley, which 
allocated $30,000 to UCSD from 
its $6.9 million Nationallnstitute 
of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism 

grant. 
To curb 

hol serves as a major 
contributor to ca es 
of sexual assault, 
according to Nancy 
Wahlig, direc-
tor of the Student 
Sa fety Awareness 
and Sexual Assault 
Resource Center. 

"Often alcohol 
is a factor in sexu-
al assaults here at 
UCSD and nation-
wide [in which) 
either the victim 
or the assailant has 
been drinking alco-
hol,"Wahligsaid. "I 
would estimate that 
probably 90 percent 
of the incidents that

the A.S. Council

occur are alcohol-related." 
Meanwhile, binge drinking has 

become a noticeable problem at 
UCSD, according to Samaniego-
Kraus. Surveys that gauged alco-
hol and dnlg use, from 1,000 
randomly elected undergradu-
ate students, conducted during 
the past two years found that 28 
percent admitted to binge drink-
ing, which was defined as four or 
more drinks for women and five 

"I think it 
is one of our 
most success-
ful, impor-
tant services," 

Thurgood Marshall College 
Senior Senator Kate Pillon said. 
"We are realistic. We know that 
srudents are going to drink; what 
we want to prevent is them from 
drinking and driving." 

CCAAP also requires coun-
seling, peer programs and moti-
vational interviewing - which 
is designed to look at students' 
behaviors and illustrate how they 
conflict with goals - for UCSD 

students with multiple alcohol 
vio la tions. 

The program also communi-
cates with students through infor-
mational "21 st birthday card" 
pamphlets that include safety and 
self-control tips, safe-party host-
ing tips and approxima te costs of 
first-time driving under the influ-
ence offenses. 

"Student just love them," 
Samaniego-Kraus said. "I get 
comment like 'Thanks for car-
ing' or 'I feel like UCSD cares.' 
The response has definitely been 
positive." 

The program also seeks to 
limit the marketing and promo-
tion of alcohol on campus by 
neither allowing alcohol adver-
tising nor accepting sponsorship 
of campus events from alcohol 
di tribu tors. 

Despite all its efforts, CCMP 
is not seeking to prohibit alcohol 
by any means, but only regulate 
its use by students in a conscious-
ly safe manner, Samaniego-Kraus 
said. 

"Limiting alcohol distribution 
does not imply eliminating it," 
she said . 

Rein tatement of events such 
as the TG's will not result in an 
alcohol-drivcn, lawless campus, 
Bezzerides said. 

"There seems to be some kind 
of misconception that by allowing 
alcohol on campus, you are going 
to have tons of underage students 
drinking with reckless abandon," 
Bezzeodes said. "We are hardly 
tallc.ing about providing alcohol 
to tho e under 21 . ... By allow-
ing alcohol on campu for tho e 
of drinking age, you are actually 
creating a safer, more-controlled 
social environment."

"I had requested to be a part 

of the committee Ithat will revise 
the proposal), but Dr. Watson 
deemed that inappropriate because 
he feel s gradate students arc not 
affected constituents," she said. "I 
disagree, since graduate students 
also pay registration fees and have 
just as much vested in the fumrc of 
UCSD as undergraduate ." 

UCSD does not need addi-
tional recruionent tools, since its 
Division II teams have been uc-
cessful enough in the past, Kwinn 
said. 

The senate did not spccify which 
provisions it wished to ee changed 
in the proposal. ] lowcver, senate 
members had opposed the proposal 
in the spring because they did not 
consider a 2.6 CPA requirement 
to receive the scholarship high 
enough to maintain the tradition 
of srudent-athletes that excel aca-
dcmically, according to the senate's 
Assistant Director Gaye Hill. 

Thc grants-in-aid proposal was 
made not just to meet the CAA 
requirements, but also to create a 
buzz around the athletics program, 
Spriggs said. A lot of undergradu-
ates complain that, despite all of its 
el(cellencc, UCSD lacks a cultural 
and social atmosphere, he said. 

While Maulhardt said he saw no 
correlation between giving schol-
ar hips to student-athletes and 
the gcneration of school spirit, he 
said he would take the money if 
offered.

UCSD theater/caffeine addicts to create a play from scratch in 24 hours 
By CHERIE NGUYEN 

Contributing Writer 

This weekend, three talented playwrights. e ig ht acrors, o ne d irecror and one stage manag-
er will be put to a scary test: Write 
and perform an cntire play within 
24 hours. These 13 undergradu-
ates are part of an insanely ambi -
tious c reation ca lled Insomniac 
T heatre. 

Ryan Ford and Nate Snyder are 
the mai n organizers of tnsornniac 
T heatre, and they're detennined to 
take this challenge head-on. In fact, 
none of the crew will know what 
the play will be about Imtil the 
playwrights wri te it that night. 

"The point is not to discuss it 
until we get together and actually 
start writing," Snyder sa id. 

They and Mike Swaim com-
prise the team of writers who will 
get tOgether Oct. 28 at 8 p.m. and 
write a masterpiece within four 
or five hours. From there, direc-
tor Stephanie Lee will help the 
actors get into character; rehears-
al will continue nonstop until 
Saturday night when the play is 
performed. All of this will take 
place within the span of 24 hours, 
including technical rehearsal -
which might be a problem, con-
sidering the high ceili ng of Dance 
Studio 3. 

"Technical stuff like lighting 

takes two or three days to com-
plete, out we have to do this within 
a couple of hours," Snyder said. 

fs time management a 
problem? Most definitely, but cof-
fee will be scrved if anyone has 
less than enough adrenaline needed 
to stay awake. Nevertheless, Ford 
seems rarner confident. 

upm not really that worried," 
he said. "I have no doubt that this 
will go on without a hitch, and by 
Saturday this thing will be great." 

Even though this type of theater 
is entirely new here at UCSD, other 
university theater departments all 
over the country have dabbled in 
it. Ford learned about it at his 
community colile and wanted to 

do new things that weren 't being 
done here. 

"J would love for Insomniac 
Theatre to be an annual event," 
he said. 

Since cabarets consist of volun-
tary undergraduates, this one-hour 
play will be no exception. Actor 
Gali Weissberger said, "I'm going 
to bring my sleeping bag and camp 
there" to witness the entire pro-
duction in action . Even with the 
time constraint, both actors such 
as Weissberger and writers seem to 
eagerly anticipate the event more 
than being apprehensive about it. 

Ford alone has been in theater 
for seven years and is presently the 
production manager of the New 

Play Spectacular Theatre Festival, 
while Swaim and Snyder both have 
experience in writing plays or act-
ing in them. Ford and Snyder actu-
ally met when they both performed 
in Corpus Christi, Texas, Last fall 
quarter, and Snyder has written 
a play called "Cricothyroidotomy" 
that was performed last year. 
Swaim also wrote a full-length play 
that will be perfoffiled in week 10 
of this quarter. 

Come see the new Insomniac 
Theatre play for free this Saturday, 
Oct. 29 at 8 p.m. in Dance Studio 
3, across from Stonehenge. If caf-
finated a1I-nighters and a talented 
crew can't make a good play, then 
what can? J

Lost in the department store 
Steve Martin's IShopgirl' is still prepubescent 

By ADAM KELEMAN 
Contributing Writer 

LOS Angeles is often portrayed as a city of lost hope - a city of many people where no two can relate. It is a place where lost 
souls converge and drift with sullen grace. And 
of course, this would be the perfect destina-
tion for the gloomiest girl in the world to hold 
shop. Director Anand Tucker's "Shopgirl" 
disguises itself as a modem-day fable of dour 
proportions: MirabeUe (Claire Danes) is a sad 
girl, stuck in a sad job in a sad city - how the 
hell has she not killed herself? 

As with many agonizing retail jobs, 
Mirabelle's position as lone-girl-.behind-the-
counter is depressing. She hunches over the 
counter, glancing at anything that walks her 
way, desperate to grab on to a customer for a 
sale (or love) until one day she meets Jeremy 
Oason Schwartzman). He is as awkward 
and lonely as she, but with quirks to spare. 
Maybe bt will cheer her up. Cue entrance of 
mysterious businessman Ray Porter (Steve 
Martin). His charm and money trounce 
Jeremy's immature boyishness. Their union 
creates much needed stability in Mirabelle's 
life - until he cheats on her and she stops 
taking her anti-depressants. Cue histrionics 
and precious, slow-motion tracking shot. 
These losers never had a chance. 

Mirabelle is a girl out of place - and 
maybe even time; a tall, slender thing from 
Vermont, living in a big, scary ciry, dating 
someone older than her father. Danes fits 
quite well into this mold . H er emaciatcd fi g-
ure and cavcd-in eyes fill th e creen with the 
right measure of fcar and hope. She rcca lls

REVIEW 

some of her best melancholic work since her 
early days on the shon-lived television series 
"My So-Called Life." Martin also gives an 
understated, moving performance as a fel-
low listless Los Angelean, perfectly teeming 
with allure and sadness. Schwartzman, on 
the other hand, is on autopilot, never truly 
shaking his past perfonnances of oddball 
characters to make Jeremy his own. He 
also does not contain the same emotional 
arsenal of Danes and Martin; his attempts 
feel futile. 

However, "Shopgirl" straddles - and 
strangles - the indie film-chick hierarchy: 
Mirabelle has the awkward mobility of Maggie 
Gyllenhaal in "Secretary" and the desper-
ate whimsy of Scarlett Johansson in "Lost in 
Translation." This character has been seen 
before - too many times. 

Jeremy's quirks and s.lapstick don't quite 
match up with the overall gloom and doom. 
And it does not help that the script falls flat 
everywhere but the May-December romance 
between Danes and Martin . All the sidelining 
characters seem sprinkled in for good mea-
sure, too convenient and underdeveloped. 
It is a shame Martin 's script, adapted from 
his own 2001 novella of [he same name, is 
so desperate to be liked . Using quaint but 
awkward narration to guide the audience 
along, Martin sacrifices emotional ambiguity 
for easy answers. Director Tuckcr isn ' t up to 
the challenge either. ever completely able 
to coerce good chemistry between Danes 
aJld Schwartzman, he leaves their union con-
trived and uni nspi red. 

"Shopgirl" wants to be a grown-up film 
about disconnected people in complicated 
relationships. But this is just another 61m 
about a sad girl who meets a boy, falls in love, 
and things end up just fine. What a bore.

Set Yourself On Fire 
Arts & Crafts 

Maybe it's the dark winters or the long summer days, or JUSt the federal support of the Canada Music Fund, but lately, 
many good things are coming from the North. 
With a new album of smoothly produced twee-
rock, Toronto' Stars are set to become the 
latest Northern soulmates of the equally emo-
dramatic Death Cab For Cutie. Fist-pumping 
indie romance is the name of the gamc, and 
Stars provide it without much of the self-indu-
gent style of Death Cab's Ben Gibbard . 

Stars split lead voca l duties betwee n Torqui l 
Campbell (tha t' a guy) and Amy Millan, so 
every time he complains about the relationship 
not working, he reminds us who the real bas-
tard was. Despite their often opposite perpec-
tives, they pend the greater part of the album 
wrapped upjn the other's voice, weaving thick, 
beautiful hamlOnies that offer wannth from the 
cool sheets of guitar, synth and cymbal wash, 
ca mding like falling sleet on a windshield. The 
synth-heavy numbers seem indebted to the 
Postal Service, but vaguely one-up them, while 
the guitar tracks synthesize the Smiths, minus 
Moa.er's croon (who would dare to imitate it?). 

ccording to Woody Allen and the WB, fall is 
a time for romance, and Stars provide a mostly 
perfect soundtrack to the sU/,''3rtoothed indie 
rock hipster in all of us. r hope it lasts through 
the winter. 

Stars win perform with Dellth Cllb for Cfltie at

Who Grind like Us? 
Get Low 

** He might not be the best lyricist or pro-ducer, bur JT the Bigga Figga knows the hustle of the rap game as well as anybody. 
lndependent hip-hop flourishes in the insular 
Bay Area rap scene, and JT was the original 
entrepreneur, releasing 12 solo albums and over 
20 other projects and collaborations during his 
12-year career. Sadly, for fans of the Fillmore 
native, Who Grind Like Us? is his final album. 

JTs large volume of work often favors 
quantity over quality, making mostJT albums 
a hit-or-miss affair . This album is no excep-
tion, with production ranging from smooth 
and funky to harsh and chun!.:y, typical of the 
Bay Area's synth and bass-heavy beats. Tracks 
like "What It I ~" with Keak Da Sneak and 
"Neva Per onal" featuri ng the Game are sure 
to ranle your speakers, although "We Can 
Get Low" and "Game Recognjze Game 2" 
miss the mark, using simply annoyi ng produc-
tion with no chance of lyrical compensation. 

J-r's first album was titled Don 't Stop Til 
Wr Major, and while he may not have stopped, 
he certainly did get lazy somewhere after the 
release of his first (and arguably only) suc-
ces ful single, "Game Recognize Game." J-r's 
story is that of an artist more concerned with 
making a quick dollar than a quality album, 
and a ca reer of unfulfilled potential is the 
result, with this album the disappointing and 
unoriginal concluding chapter.

In the South, the spirit of what you're doing comes through you. Southern music - or at least the mythology of blues, country and 
gospel, those cornerstones of 20th-century 
pop - relies on mysterious "feel" and "soul" 
so much that a vague, super-corporeal force 
(call it truth) that exists despite its host is now 
central to our interpretation of most popular 
music. Right? 

My Morning JaCKet certainly bang the can 
that way. On past records, the ever-rootsy 
(and that means Southern-styled, remember) 
Louisvillians almost always wore two favorite, 
ephemeral ga rments: a drawn-out, time-inno-
cent drawl and their s ignature coming-from-
the-ghostly-forgotten-past vi be, both of which 
they've managed to write and record quite well 
without, as new album Z evidences. Its slide-
guitar atmospherics prelude grungier stomps 
that we've heard from th ese boys before. 
Quinte sentially MMJ gra in-silo reverb for 
once shares pace with a fresh reggae day-

. dream - "Off the Record" could have been a 
train wreck, but their sprawling musicianship 
(and Jim James' towering songwriting) tum it 
into the album's best song. Z is far from per-
fect (a lthough its production is just that), but 
all the musica l wanderlust shows one thing: 
My Morning Jacket, like the best Southern 
musicians, have enough of that mystery feel to 
play just what comes out.

Punk cradle eBGB's stays blissfully trashy 
as it fights Bowery for landmark recognition 

By JACKIE SNOW 
Staff Writer 

My mother is a '70s rock show elitist. She saw the Stones, she saw Led ZeppeLin (twice) and yes, she went to CBGB's 
when she was 17 and got drunk at the bar while 
Blondie was performing. She saw Television 
too, the most-hyped band playing at eBG B's at 
the time, but wrote them off as "pretty boys." 
I am forever living in my mother's concert 
shadow. Any show I go to, she has seen three 
better ones. 

CBGB's (which sta nds for Country, 
Bluegrass, and Blues - now you' re in on the 
secret) opened in 1973, trying to cater to a 
country and blues crowd. The owner, Hilly 
Kristal , let th e punk band Television play 
there on a whim that same year. Television 
were so well-received, they were invited back 
and brought along a new band, the Ramones 
- the rest is history. Everyone from Guns N' 
Roses to Patti Smith have played at CBGB's, 
but far from being an elitist venue, more no-
nam es than big ones play the stage seven days 
a week. 

On Aug. 31, the lease expired for C BGB's 
and the new landlord , Bowery Residence 
Comminee. is not willing to cxtend the lease, 
citing the low rent of CBGB's lease - and the 
fact that 100,000 of it is cu rrently unpaid. 
Other issue, such as improper rent increase'> 
and the doublin g of rent if a new lea~e is to be 
drawn up further complicate the court case. 

' umerous organization\ and people, from 
. ew York City 1ayor .'\1ichacl Bloomberg 

to Public Enemy have petitioned to save 
CBG B's, onc of the last important rock land-
marks in ew York, but to no avail. T he law-
yers could be tied up in court for months, but 
Kristal pl ans to move the venue to Las Vegas 
if its forced out. 

Anned with this knowledge and the sheer 
detemunation to one-up my motller, the only 
certain thing I knew about my trip to Manhattan 
this summer was that I was going to have my 
first, and possibly La t, trip to C BGB's. 

Showing up randomly, 1 felt that not 
knowing the band I was about to pay 12 to

punk' forerunn ers and big names got their 
humble beginnings. With the 260-capacity 
room containing no more then 30 people, 
it couldn't be too far removed from the old 
days of punk rock. On this night, however, 
I discovered why the club wa s empty and

Artpower! brings Italian Trio di Parma to resulTect 
the ·Archduke' at the Neurosciences Institute 
By MEHRDAD YAZDANI 

Senior Staff Writer 

U CSD's latest efforts to sup-port the arts brings Italy's Trio di Panna to showcase 
Western classical art music at the 

eurosciences Institute on Oct. 
28. The event is part of UCSD's 
"ArtPower!" series, or, for brev-
ity/hipness, "ArtPwr." T he trio 
has managed to gain internation-
al recognition, winning compe-
titions such as the Vittorio Gui 
International Competition and 
the Melbourne International 
Competition and countless others. 
And YOll thought Italy was only 
good at soccer. 

Indeed, although the music fits 
more with the Germanic tradition 
- the concert program includes 
works by Joseph Haydn, Franz Liszt 
and Beethoven - Italy's influence 
on Western art music is unques-
tionable. Without doubt Italians 
have some musical genes, since the 
very language of music itself, from 
" 'ercendos to the nd4gios, is perma-
nently ingrained in Western music 
culture. Moreover, many of the fin-
est musicians have been Italian (see 
pianist Michelangeli and conductor 
Toscanini). Trio di Parma continue 
the great tradition of interpreting 
the works of the masters. 

Haydn 's works, featuring his 
"Gypsy" keyboard trio, are often 
considered to be the key transition 
between the late baroque and the 
earlyclassical period. Unfortunately, 
though his genius is unquestioned, 
after centuries of musical develop-

!.AI cloke vita: lha( s a violin, piano dnd cello that make up the Trio di Parma, IMlo will

ment and advances, the works of 
Haydn serve more as a musical his-
tory lesson than musical enlighten-
ment. In his keyboard trio works, 
one can experience its historical 
development. In the early works, 
the ceUo would simply mimic the 
left hand of the keyboard, to serve 
as a sort of grand reinforcement. As 
the years progressed, Haydn gave 
more freedom and independence to 
the individual instruments, enabling 
the cello, keyboard and violin to 
have their own unique voice. 

The development of each instru-
ment in the keyboard trio having 
complete independence was in full 
swing by the time of Beethoven. 
His "Archduke" keyboard trio, 
one of Beethoven's many master-
pieces, glorifies the power of the 

PelarTIO'IeB, ~ 

keyboard trio as a collective unit, 
while simultaneously recogniz-
ing the importance of retaining 
each instrument's individuality. 
The "Archduke" ·is also famous for 
being the last work that Beethoven 
perfonned in public, after which he 
retreated to composition only. T he 
Liszt keyboard trios are, as expect-
ed, virtuosic pieces composed in 
the typical romantic style of the 
composer's day. Surely, the Liszt 
pieces will be the highlight and 
sparkle of the evening. As a whole, 
the music that the trio perfonns is 
simply, as Italians and musicians 
alike would say, r;/Qlce.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN TliURSDAY, OCTOBER 27, 2005 

Shoes: The left and right of running shoes 
continued from page J 6 

ing advancements in footwear 
until I toole. a trip down to Road 
Runner Sports in San Diego and 
learned just how much I didn't 
Irnow about picking a good pair 
of running shoes. Suddenly just 
running around the store a cou-
ple of times didn't cut it; all the 
different foot types, how each 
shoe is constructed to fit your 
needs and what type of material 
the shoe is made of all show how 
important it is to get a shoe that 
fits you. 

In the past, buying shoes was 
always the same routine. I'd try 
on pair after pair and walle. around 
in circles in some store until I 
convinced myself, MYes, these are 
it." Forget the pain and blisters 
that came trying to break in the 
shoes afterwards. As long as- it felt 
comfortable at the time, I figured 
that the shoes would break me in 
soon enough. Wrong. Running 
shoes should be comfortable from 
the get-go and shouldn't require 
painful runs trying to breale. them 
in. If the shoes are a good match, 
you won't have to worry about 
blisters and soreness. 

Finding the perfect running 
shoe starts out with finding out 
what kind of foot type you have. 
Think of it like the three bears 
did in the story of GoldilockS; you 
test out different types until you 
feel comfonable enough to lie 
down and fall asleep without any 
worry that some girl is going to 
wake you up and tell you that 
you're wearing the wrong pair 
of shoes. 

The easiest way to do that is 
to look at an old pair of running 
shoes: Are your shoes worn on 
the outside of the heel and now 
roll inwards? Have you noticed 

that you have not had an effective 
shock absorber while running? 
Or is the wear and tear just on the 
outside of the heel? 

If your shoe shows wear on the 
outside of the heel and then rolls 
elltremely inward, then you have a 
pronated foot type - welcome to 
where the majority of the popula-
tion hangs out. This means that 
you are flatfooted and should find 
a shoe with a straight last (the 
foot-shaped mold at the bottom, 
of which the shoe is constructed), 
meaning there should be no arch . 
between the front of the foot and 
heel. The perfect shoe for you 
is a motion control shoe, which 
are the most rigid and control-
oriented running shoes. They're 
usually a tad heavier but compen-
sate with their durability; motion 
control shoes are intended to 
control extreme inward rolling 
of the foot and ankle, which may 
lead to injury. If you overpronate, 
try shoes that lace up higher so 
that you can better tailor the fit 
of your shoe. 

If that wasn't you, I pres-
ent to you bed No.2: If you've 
noticed that your shoes have not 
been able to absorb shock as well 
and if your foot is rigid, chances 
are you have a high arch. Your 
remedy is a pair of shoes with 
50ft midsoles and a semicurved 
or curved last. Runners with high 
arches will most likely do best 
in cushioned shoes, because they 
offer the least added stability and 
their semi curved or curved last 
encourages foot motion, which 
helps runners who have stiff feet, 
called underpronators. 

Still doesn't sound familiar? 
Then its time to try bed No.3; 
looking at the bottom of your 
shoes, if you land on the outside 

of your heel and roll slightly 
inward, then let me be the first 
to congratulate you. You join the 
10 percent of the population who 
have ideal feet. Stability shoes 
are the ideal shoes for you; they 
have a denser foam inserted into 
the arch-side section of the mid-
sole to help support and regulate 
ellcessive rear-foot motion. 

These are just the three main 
categorit-s of running shoes, but 
it's important to keep in mind 
that there is no "best shoe." 
No matter what all the online 
reviews say, everyone has differ-
ent requirements. Your weight, 
surfaces on which you run and 
the shape of your feet all must be 
taken into consideration before 
deciding. What might have 
worked for your best friend or 
mom doesn't necessarily work for 
you. 

It's also important to make 
sure that you have a thumb of 
space between the tip of your 
toe and the top of the shoe. Any 
more space will cause your foot 
to slide around in your shoe and 
create blisters. Before you buy, 
try running on a hard surface (not 
just the carpet of the store) to put 
yourself in your natural habitat 
and get the feeling for how the 
shoe will feel on hard pavement. 

Sure, it seems like a lot of 
information to buy just a pair of 
shoes, but take it as though you're 
buying a car. You wouldn't buy a 
car without test driving and doing 
your share of the research first, so 
why would you equip your body 
without doing the research? It 
takes a bit of time and energy, but 
with the right help and explora-
tion, you'll be able to kiss those 
days of breaking your feet over a 
pair of shoes goodbye.

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 27. 2005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

'Runners: Arsdale named Coach of the Year 
cominued from page ,6 

runners in the event, and ea rned 
All-CCAA honor . 

The Triton women accumu-
lated a daunting score of 28, 17 
points ahead of the second-place 
team. This was the third first-
place finish for the women's squad 
this season. 

The forerunner of the Triton 
men's team was senior Carl 
Lostrom, whose lOth-place time 
of 25:29 earned him All-CCAA 
honors. 

Lostrom 's time was only a min-
ute behind the first-place result. 
The Triton men collected 76 
points to place behind first-place 
Chico State (16) and second-place 
Cal Poly Pomona (67) . 

Lostrom's fellow seniors, Chris 
Beetley-Hagler and Luke Sigmon, 
finished strongly in 14th and 15th 
places, with respective times of 
25:56 and 25:58. The pair joined 
Lostrom in earning Al1-CCAA 
honors. 

The up-and-coming young tal-
ent of the team also did well in the 
race, with freshman Jake LeVieux 
and sophomore Matthew Noble 
placing 22 nd and 25th, capping off 
the top five Triton men finishers . 
LeVieux finished in 26:29, while 

oble crossed the finish with a 
time of 26:39 in the 8k race. 

UC D head coach Ted Van 
Arsdale was awarded the title of 
CCAA Coach of the Year in his 
14th yea r coaching the Tritons. 
lIe received the hono r for helping 
the Tritons to their second-ever 
CCAA title. UCSD won its last 
title eight year ago in 1997, wh en 
the school competed at the NCAA 
Division UI level. 

The men and women 's teams 
are coming into the home stretch 
of thei r season, and with a atisfy-
ing series of meets behind them, 
the Tritons will no" take some 
well-deserved time off before their 
next challenge. 

The teams will next travel to 
Cal Poly Pomona to participate in 
the C West Regional on ov. 
5. ]f the teams continue with their 
strong performances, they will 
qualify for the CM Division II 
National Championships. At last 
year's event, the women 's squad 
placed 17th in a field of 24. This 
year's championship event will be 
at Chino Hills in Pomona, Calif., 
on ov.19. 

Billy Wong/Cuardian

anyone make fun of you for having 
purple shoes?), brand (Reebok Air 
Pumps or Filas ring a bell?), and 
style, and you had found the per-
fect shoe. If the shoe made you feel 
like you could run faster and jump 
higher, you felt like you could take 
on the whole world - or the play-
ground - the next day. 

It\ funny to look back at how 
much shoes have changed. Gone 
are the flickering lights that glow 
with eve ry step. I nstead we have 
linlc wheels at the bottOm of shoes 
causing us to do double takes when 
we see kids glide around the super-
market. A couple years ago, it 
seemed as though ike used to 
monopolize the shoe industry, but 
nO\\ \~e have companic specializ-

to progress footwear technology 
but .llm making it that much hard -

the hest fit. Which makes me wish

Suits in, bling 
out with new 
NBA policy 

Stern justified 
in creating dress 
code for players

In recent years, the NBA has 

fully embraced the hip-hop cul-
ture that has eemed to represent 
their ever-younger core of star 
players. T he adaptation can be 
seen in areas ranging from attitude 
to clothing to the lyrical prow-
ess of stars like Indiana Pacer 
forward Ron Arte t, Philadelphia 
76ers guard AJlen Iverson and of 
course, the rapping genie him-
self, Miami Heat center Shaquille 
"Kazaam" O'Neal. And while bas-
ketball players pose as rap art-
ists, rap artist in tu rn pose as 
basketball players. Master P made 
himself say "ugh" numerous ti me 
while trying to make the Toronto 
Raptors. Snoop Dogg plays bas-
ketball so much that he could 
probably start at point guard for 
the Lakers. (Yes, Frankie Muniz 
could also start at point, but that's 
beside t he point.) I cily, Jay-Z 
and Usher love the game so much 
that they now have owner hip 
interests in the Charlotte Bobcats, 
New Jersey ets and Cleveland 
LeBrons, respectively. 

No matter how much hip-
hop culture has influenced and 
changed the NBA and its players, 
league commissioner David Stern 
has decided to effectively bite 
the hand that pimped his ride by 
implementing an leaguewide dress 
code. The dress code, which has 
been described as business casual, 
would take away tlo-rags, bling-
bling, retro jerseys and all other 
cool accessories that I can nei-
ther afford nor wear convincingly. 
Basically, the dress code applies 
at the walk from the team bus to 
the arena, from the arena back to 
the bus, during post-game press 
conferences, while seated on NBA 
benches, in the stands when not 
playing and even special events 
and appearances. O n the courts, 
however, you ca n sti ll wear your 
jersey, even though this too is 
league-mandated. 

So, has the NBA become a 
dicta torial private school where 
shirts have to be nIcked in and 
length of skirts continuously mea-
sured? Actually, the NBA has JUSt 
become like every other workplace 
in America, save for the exorbitant 
paychecks, conspiracy theories 
and hot young women dancing 
(unless, of course, you work for 
the government). 

The NBA might be lowering 
the iron fist in the eyes of many 
players and some fans, but George 
Steinbrenner has been imposing 
even harsher restrictions on his 
players for years. Stern isn't going 
to make Kevin Garnett shave his 
goatee, Ben Wallace trim his Afro 
or Kobe Bryant drop his attitude. 
He just wants to see more people 
coming to the arena dressed like 
MichaelJordan, fewer dressed like 
Allen Iverson and none dressed 
like Mark Cuban, because that guy 
is just a bum. Cuban, the Danas 
Mavericb owner, was even men-
tioned by Stem when the policy
