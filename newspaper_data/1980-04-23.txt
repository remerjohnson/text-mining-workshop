House 'Votes Draft Re • • Istratlon Funds 
Senate Must Still Approve The $13.3 Million; Filibuster Promised 

From the Auoc:iated Presl 
WASHINGTON - The House of 

Representatives gave its approval yesterday to 
President Carter's plan to register millions of young 
men for the draft this summer. 

The House passed a measure to supply $13.3 
million to revitalize the donnant Selective Service 
System and clear the way for registration of some 4 
million young men aged 19 and 20. 

House approval of the draft registration proposal 
came on a preliminary vote of 218·188 after House 

Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill had predicted the 
measure would pass. The final vote, taken after 
consideration of several amendments, was 219·1BO, 
closer than White House officials had expected. 

Although the House approved the registration 
plan, it would take further congressional action to 
institute an actual draft. 

Under Carter's plan, young men born in 1960 and 
1961 will be required to register for the draft at post 
offices across the country.

students on all the campuses 
in France. Before even 
coming to France a foreign 
student will have to pre· 
register at the French 
Emba.sy in hi, country. 

This i. not yet certain, lor 
the texts of the law. are 
unclear, but it _ms that 
these conditions might only 
affect third world students. 
'The students from Common 
Market Countries are 
exempt from the new 
regulations, but how they 
aRect students from North 
America is not yet certain. 
So, it is not enough 10 speak 

about discrimina·tion, we 
musl call these bills racist, 
too. 

And Pre.idenl Giscard 
d'Eataing keeps telling us 
that France is a very open 
country in which aU the 
refugee. 01 the world can 
come and live free! Of course 
the presidential election is 
next year and the campaign 
has been going on alread y for 
months, but this cannot 
excuse the hypocrisy 1)( our 
government. 

So what happened? 
Grenoble has been one of the 
mosl active cam~ses in 
France on this ) issue, 

These two weeks 
have been a political 
lesson for everybody, 
especially for the 
American students 
here, too used to the 
apathy of their 
campuses. 

probably because of the high 
proportion of foreign 
students (10,000 out of 
30,(00). 

The strike began when the 
local government officer (the 
"prefet") decided to organize 
the exam for the foreign 
students who wanted to stay 
in the country. The exam 
was boycotted and only 18 
students of 218 who were 
eligible to take the exam that 
day showed up. Thai was 
March 27 . 

On the same day we 
marched, and the police 
charged. This is when the 
strike started. 

What we were demand-
ing was the abrogation of the 
bills. For two weeks there 
were marches and meetings 
nearly every day. The 
biggest rallied 10,000 
students to the city hall, 
where the mayor told us he

We occupied the adminis-
tration building, which we 
turned into a forum of 
discussions . I personally 
spent a whole night in this 
building and it was very nice

between French and foreign 
students. 

fifty-one sludents stopped 
eating for these two weeks 
(what we call "greve de Ia 
faim") . 

The slrategy of the 
authorities was to wait until 
the vacations, hoping thai 
the movement would die by 
itself. 

AI this point none of our 
demands have been satisfied . 

Despite the obvious wish 
of the authorities, it will be 
very surprising if the 
movement is not reborn after 
the vacation. If the slrike 
continues, there will be 
hardship for the sludents. 
Instead of taking a 
comprehensive exam in 
June, as is usual, the exam 
will be postponed until Sep-

exams then. But des pile the

been any .tory. (Especially 
since Ms. Smith had not even 
legally. pressed charges 
against Mr. Wright.) 

Secondly, the manner in 
which the incident was 
presented was equally 
despicable. While you 
promised not to run Smith's 
accusations, at Wright's 
request, you slyly wove the 
horrifying "facts" into an 
alternalive story on the 
mental in.tability of Mr. 
Wright (April 18). Well , you

out, didn'l you? 

Thirdly, your myslerious

almost every woman on this

Spielman Misleading 
Editor : 

In Monday's issue of The Doily Gu.ordian (ASU~SD 
Bulletin Candidates' Statements) Bob Spielmann, candidale 
for Co.'nmillioner of Student WeKare, claims to be a 
"member of the Third College Judicial Board." According 10 
the Third College Dean'. office he is not a member, although 
Spielmann did apparently sil in on one or two meetings of that 
b«Miy. . 

An isolated incident? An under.tandable exaggeratIon of 
one's qualification.? Perhaps. Something to be expected of 
any politician - even one who claims to .upport "Action nol 
Politics." 

On hi. campaign literature, distributed widely around 
campus, Spielmann claims that "for year •• tudents were 
promised an eRective student advocate program ... we don't 
have one yet." Three years ago the Student Advocate 
Program was established - it has handled about 150 c_ 
and has yet to lose a single one. 

Il i, unfortunate thai Spielmann finds it necessary to base 
his campaign on misleading the students - that he is unable 
10 run a campaign on illues and experience.

Threats Between 
Europe, Iran Made 

America's European allies 
yesterday ordered immediate 
reduction in their diplomatic 
staffs in Iran and said they 
wou ld impos e economic 
sanctions unless "decisive 
progress" is made by mid· May 
toward freeing the American 
hostages in Tehran. 

Iran theatened to stop oil 
exports to countries that join 
the US sanctions and took 
steps to move closer to the 
Soviet bloc. 

The European al lies a lso 
ordered an arms embargo 
against Iran immediately. 
They said they would send 
their ambassadors back to 
Tehran to urge the Iranian 
government to free the 53 
hostages held since Nov . 4 . 

In the northwestern Iran 
province of Kurdistan, clashes 
in several cities reportedly left 
six persons dead as a dispute 
over autonomy intensified. 
Tehran Radio reported calm 
returned to Tehra n University 
but another Iranian news 
organization reported five 
persons killed in a clash at 
Gilan University. 

Classes resumed, bul 
reports listed as many as 21 
persons killed in the latest 

outbreak of campus unrest. 
Foreign ministers of the 

European Common Market 
co untries reached their 
decis ion at the end of a Iwo· 
day meeting in Luxembourg . 
In a statement , they said 
"decisive progress" toward 
release of the hostages would 
have to be made to stop the 
trade sanctions. The phrase 
was not defined. 

Conference officials said if 
the initial steps by the 
Common Market members 
fail to win the release of the 
hostages , tr ade sanctions 
banning exports o f all 
materials except vital medical 
supplies would be activated in 
mid-May when the foreign 
ministers are scheduled to 
meet again in Milan, Italy. 

Japanese Foreign Minister 
Saburo Okita met individually 
with several of the ministers in 
Luxembourg on Monday and 
yesterday, and told reporters 
his country would be inclined 
to follow the Common 
Market's program. He said no 
definite decision would be 
made until after he meets with 
President Carler in Washing. 
ton next month.

State Surplus Up 
To $2 Billion 

SACRAMENTO 
Inflation will increase the 
state's budget surplus on Jupe

and $2.485 billion, according 
to a new forecast by the 
Legisla ture 's fiscal adviser 
released yesterday. 

The estimate by Legislative 
Analyst William Hamm was 
made public by Assembly 
Ways and Means Committee 
Chairman John Vasconcellos, 
who also unveiled a new 
proposal to cut the state sales 
ta x as an alternative to 
Proposition 9 . 

Hamm's forecast is $400 to 
$650 million more than the

Students Get Way On Budget Items 
Except for Increase in Medical Tuition, Assembly Committee Agrees 

BY CAROLYN FRIDAY 
s..:.-.... c.. ... pDl ..... 1 

Moat of the .tudent.supported items 
in the UC buclQet fared well as the 
A .. embly Wayt and Means 
Subcommittee wound up two months 
01 deliberation on the $965 million UC 
buclaet. 

1'he committee voted to appropriate 
$1. 9 million for undergraduate 
Affirmative Action, $29.000 for 
Iludent participation in the coUective 
_pining process. $1. 1 malion for an 
.dditional 92 teaching aasi5tants, 
$300,000 for the California Writing 
Project. and $168.000 for 
Appropriate Technology. 

-The only setback wu the 
committee's decision to institute 
$1,000 bWon for students in the 
health .aencea (medicine. dentistry. 
veterinary). to be phased in over the 
nat two y .... in $500 increments. 

The committee mitil(ated the 
setbac!i however. by approving a 
defa rea payment plan, which permits

residency training or a low-salaried 
public service job. The tuition fee will 
be raised altogether if the student 
chooses to practice in an underserviced 
area of the state. 

"I think the committee set an 
important precedent through this 
budget language." said VC Student 
Lobby Co-Director Paul Rogers. "If 
there hat to be tuition. students should 
be able to defer payment until after 
graduation." 

The committee rejected a motion to 
reduce the VC budget by $30.000 to 
offset the co.t of VC President David 
Saxon', letter to students warning 
about the po.libility of tuition should 
Prop. 9 pass_ But Assemblyman John 
Valconcellol (D-San Jose) 
recommended that UC officials make a 
funding shift 10 that IUch costs are 
covered by the Regents and 'not the 
state. 

"It was an unwise use of the .tate·s 
fund .... said Vasconcellos. "I am not 
lUre it was ilegal. but I wouldn't bet on 
the courts bailing you out." 
Vasconcellos said in reference to the 
many lawsuits charging Saxon with 

misuse in state funds for political 
purposes. 

While voting to cut back on the 
university's funding for collective 
bargaining from $752.000 to 
$250.000. the Assembly committee 
approved the student's request for 
$29.000 for student participation in 
collective bargaining. 

In compliance with the Berman act 
authorizing collective bargaining for 
the university. the UC Student Lobby 
requested funds for a systemwide 
coordinator to assist students who will 
participate in collective bargaining 
negotiations on each campus. The 
Regents had ignored a similar request 
last fall at their September meeting. 

The committee voted to commit 
$1.9 million of the state money for the 
university 's undergraduate student 
affirmative action programs. but 
reneged on an earlier decision to 
partially fund the $600.000 new 
graduate student affirmative action 
plan. 

In voting the $1.9 million 
appropriation for the undergraduate 
plan. the committee opted for full state

Women Out of Their League: 
Shut Out by USIU in Softball 

But Hollander Gets Two Unassisted Double Plays 

BY SAMANTHA ROBY 
Plagued by too many three· 

up, three-down innings and 
playing two AlA W divisions 
above their own, the women 's 
softball team lost to USIU at 
hom last Thursday, 6·0. 
USIU's fielding wasn't superb, 
but their pitching made up for 
any shortcomings in the field. 
The Tritons found it very 
difficult to hit off of the USIU 
hurler's strong fastball. 

USIU scored first on four 
base hits; two on bunts. then, 
UCSD third baseman Sue 
Hollander made an unassisted 
double.play, tagging runners 
both going and coming at 
third . The next hit, Hollander 
made the third out on a tag , 
completing her one woman 
show. 

In the bottom of the first , 
UCSD's Sue Weinsoff led off 
with a double to left field but 
was caught in a game of pickle 
between second and third base 
to become the first Triton out. 
The remaining two outs were 
on strike·outs. 

In the top of the second , 
USIU carne up with five base 
hits, inc.luding a double , with 
two runs scoring. StilI, 
UCSD's defe nsive teamwork 
was improving . The Tritons 
went down in order in the 
bottom of the inning, again 

fallin g victim to·strike·outs. 
The third and fourth innings 

were dominated by defensive. 
UCSD made it on the alertness 
of their fielders. USIU got 
three hits but were unab.le to 
score in either inning. 
Offensively, UCSD went 
nowhere. 

For the Tritons, the fifth

inning had the same script. 
They were offensively 
stagnant except for leftfie.lder 
Ellen Sid.le's .lone hit. Not so for 
USIU. They stole three bases, 
bringing in two runs. 

UCSD never got another 
chance. The last two innings 
saw the Tritons, troubled by 
USIU's pitching expertise, go 
down in order . USI U managed 
to get another run on a double 
to deep .left . 

The day seemed made for 
HolIander and unassisted 
double plays; she made 
another in the top of the 
seventh. It was the same play, 
except this time, there was a 
dispute with the umpire about 
whether or not the in.coming 
runner was o'!t. The ump ru.led

favora bly for UCSD and 
Hollander go t her second 
unassisted double .play, and 
the game ball. 

Despite the loss, whic h 
brings the Tritons ' season 
record to 0.5, Coach David 
Briggs said they "played 
extreme.ly well. I'm reaHy 
pleased ." And he has good 
cause. USIU is a 10 
scholarship team and a 
member of Division .I while 
UCSD has no players on 
scholarship and be.longs to 
Di vision III. 

Briggs knows that his team 
has a lot of weak points and 
doesn't make excuses for them 
but their defensive abi.lity has 
improved . "They are coming 
along real well. Our biggest 
problem is hitting; if you don ' t 
hit, you don't score runs." 

Briggs thinks that with some 
work , the Tritons can become 
a team to contend with. 

" It this team can come bac k 
next year, we'll have a good 
nu cleus and we ' ll be 
recognized as an up and 
coming team." 

The- Tritons' next home 
game is a doubleheader 
against UC Santa Barbara on 
Friday , May 2nd.

Triton Women Rout Cal Lutheran 8-1 in Tennis 
BY SAMANTHA ROBY 
The women 's tennis team, 

having just shut out two 
opponents, routed Cal 
Lutheran 8 . } last Friday in 
thei r fina.! home match of the 
season. Their two previous 
victories came against Point 
Lorna and La Verne. 

Although still rec uperating 
from an ear ly season foot 
injury, UCSD's number one 
seed Cecilia Kavanaugh was 
back in action for the Tritons' 
home fina le . Throughout her 
match against Cal Lutheran 's 
Lisa McCulIum , the normally 
aggressive Kav a na ugh 
covered the court ca utiously. 

According to coach Liz 
Dudash, Kavanaugh "isn't 
playing up to par yet. She can 
hit a lot harder than she 's 
doing." 

Aside from Kavanaugh's 
victory , the match was fairly 
lackluster. Kavanaugh and 
McCullum kept the pace easy, 
frequently resorting to lobs. 
StiH, Kavanaugh demonstrat· 
ed her abiIity to place shots 
stra tegically. 

During the match, two 
di sputes erupted between 
Kavanaugh and McCulIum 
over scores. There were other 
noticeable signs of animosity 
between the two. 

Kavanaugh took the firs t sel 
easily 6·3. She rarely double· 
fauIted and her shots were 
strong. She encountered much 
more trouble in the second set. 

After eight games, she 
faced a 5 ·3 deficit, but 
overcame it to take the second 

set 7·6 in a tiebreaker full of 
long rallies. 

The Tri tons swept through 
the Cal Lutheran lineup as 
Rob in Davis , Carolyn 
Shugart , J enny Manset , 
Laura Smith and Elizabeth 
Saar were winners in singles. 

In doub.les, the teams of 
Davis and Manset , and 
Shugart a nd Smith emerged 
victorious. The UCSD doubles 
team of Parry a nd Saar 
marked the only loss on an 
otherwise pefect slate. 

The Triton's next event is 
the presti gio us Ojai 
Tournament next Thursday 
through Saturday. AlI the top 
universities attend, sending 
their top two players and a 
doubles team. 

Unless Kavanaugh's foot 
acts up again, she a nd Robin 
Davis will represent UCSD as 
singles players, Shugart is an 
a lternate singles contestant. 

The doubles tea m for 
UCSD will be Jenny Manset 
and Laura Smith . 

Unfortunately, there may 
be a problem for Kavanaugh 
a nd Davis. They each have a 
sc hedul ed midterm in a 
biology class Friday. They 
asked the professor if it would 
be possible for them to take the 
midterm Wednesday, even 
though it puts them a t a 
disadvantage. Not only did he 
refuse, but he got angry a t 
their inquiry, saying the school 
is not a country club and that 
they'd have to choose between 
tennis and their education, 
accordinl{ to Dudash.

If the two make it through 
the preliminary rounds on 
Thursday, they will then have 
a difficult decision to ma ke: 
finish o ut the tournament and 
forfeit the midterm, or forfei t 

th e remainder of th e 
tournament and return for the 
midterm. It's an unfortunate 
position to be in. Dudash, 
Da vi s and Kavanaugh are, 
needless to say, disheartened 

by the setback. 
If the Tritons beat 

Westmont on Saturday, May 
3, they'U have won their 
conference and gained a berth

~~n Davis, after replacing an injured Cecilia Kavanaugh in UCSO'. number one 
poslhon, was back at number two against Cal Lutheran. She reaponded to the return of 
Kavanau h with a decisive win.

'ffolkes' Loosens 
Moore's Bonds 

Erstwhile 007 in Boring Adventures 
Roger Moore stands out 

from most major screen 
performers in that he doesn't 
mind being typecast. In fact, 
unlike Sean Connery, Moore 
realizes that the role of James 
Bond is likely to be the best 
one he11 ever get. And in 
between Bond s, Moore 
doesn't seem to mind playing 
the same type of superhero 
tou g h- guy wisecra c kin g 
character in a series of 
enjoyable but inferior 
adventure films including 
Shout AI The Devil , The Wild 
Ceese, Cold and the re ent 
({olkes . 

Moore, a gradua te of the 
Eyebrow-Raising School Of 
Acting, is not really an ac tor at 
all but a Personality, in the 
tradition of Errol Flynn, David 
Niven, and (dare I say it?) 
Clark Gable. Although the 
latter three were beller a t it 
than he is, Moore usually 
comes 011 as a mildly 
entertaining and likable rogue. 
Incredibly , enough, Roger 
Moore is presently the number 
one box office attraction in the 
world! But perhaps this is 
logical - Sean Conner-y was 
also number one during the 
mid-60s while he portrayed 
007 .

isn't capitalized. Perha ps if 
Universal had called it Ffolkes 
instead of ffolkes I wouldn't 
have felt so threatened and 
enioyed it more (or Moore). 
But the troubles with ffolkes 
don 't end with th till . That's 
where they begin ...

sance" owing to the influx of 
important intellec tual thinkers 
and prominent people in 
business and science into the 
area. Curiously, although 
there il a plethora of talent in 
the area, this community of 
gifted minds has had little in 
the way of a forum for the 
presentation of local talent. 
Dennis Wills, a newcomer to 
·the La Jolla area and 
proprietor of the D.G. Wills 
Bookstore, wants to change all 
that. 

" I came to La Jolla to buy 
and sell used books," says 
Wills, " Th e academic 
community here needs a good 
off-campus used bookstore . 
However, through association 
with memb e rs of the 
community , I have been 
actively promoting local 
writers, artists, and musicians 
through a series of free events 
open to the publ ic." 

Via the sponsorship of 
poetry readings music recitals , 
a nd multimedia events, Wills 
has es tabli ~ hed his store in the 
few short months he has been 
here as an important cultural 
site . 

U I've set up the store with 
the idea of offering customers 
a low-pressure environment 
conducive to browsing a nd 
encouragi ng conversation. " 

Wills opened shop in 
September of last year, having 
previously been involved with 
book sales on the Eastern 
seaboard. He has studied 
philosophy a t Oxford, a nd has 
a Mast ers de gree from 
Columbia in international 

" I also worked with the 
National Security Agency, 
and the Resea rch Institute on 
Int erna ti onal Change at 
Columbia , which was then 
heade d by Zbigni e w 
Brzezinski." His asso iation 
with intelligence and policy-
making bur ea u s has 
precipitated a long-standing 
interest in international affairs, 
which is reflected in his 
sizeable number of Soviet 
studies selections. 

Wills became distressed 
over many of the goings-on in 
the international community. 
"I decided that my time would 

be better spen t in an 
atmosphere of m ent al 
experimentation." He prefers 
to see ideas being articulated 
and people thinking and 
speaking on arts and world 
affairs to the a tmosphere of 
Washington . " I'd rather be in 
the company of Plato and 
Shakespeare than parasitic 
mediocrity in Washington ." 

Another precept behind the 
bookstore is to provide a 
"forum for dialogue" modeled 
to a degree alter the cultural 
community described in 
Hilton's Lost Horizon. "Lost 
Horizon Books was, in fact, 

I I 10 

the original na me of the store. 
'T 0 an extent there is a 

re lationsh ip between my 
interest in oviet ideology a nd 
th books to re co ncep t, 
because I abhor the placement 
of limits or oppressi ve fellers 
on the exercise of the mind. I 
enjoy being in the company of 
people who seek to extend the 
c urrent paradigms of 
knowledge, and La JoUa is a 
great repository of just such 
individuals." 

"Many customers visit the 
store to enlarge or enhance 
their own personal libraries, 
but a great . deal of traffic

affairs . ----~==============~ 

includes students and the 
curious , and people who want 
to come in and talk and drink 
coffee. " 

Currently, an ongoing 
biweekly Monday evening 
poetry series has attracted 
much community interest , as 
local poets and fiction writers 
are given the opportunity to 
read from their works before 
an informal gathering in an 
intimate patio environment. 

"We had a St. Patrick', 
Day party recently; a woman 
came walking into the store 
playing bagpipes and brought 
down the house." 

Additional event, included 
a multi-media poetry, muaic 
and dance presentation by 
local attorney Thomas 
Gayton, classical chamber 
music , and a folk music recital. 

Tentatively scheduled are a 
series of biweekly Friday or 
Saturday evening perfor-
mance of local classical, folk 
and jazz artists. Auditions 
may be arranged by 
contacting Wdls at 456-1800 
between the business hours of 
10 a m a nd 10 pm daily, or 
stopping by at 7527 La Jolla 
Blvd . near Pearl. 

" If the Town Council will grant 
its approval, one plan I have in 
the works is to sponsor an 
outdoor afternoon symphony 
concert," says Wills. " In the 
past few days, San Francisco 
poet Ed Henderson held a 
reading 'at the store,' t he adds , 
"and I hope to be able to bring 
in other nationally-recognized 
literari and musical artists, 
their schedules permitting."

Dav id Brin 's SunditJer

It is a book loaded with

STUDENT RECREATION 
FACILITIES REFERENDUM 

In April, 1980, undergradu. 
ate and graduate students at 
UCSD wiD be asked to vote on a 
student referendum to construct, 
maintain, and operate new 
student recreation faci~ties. 

The question will appear on 
the ballot as follows: 

"Shall the Students of the 
University of California at San 
Diego assess themselves a fee of 
$6.50 per quarter per student for 
a period of up to 25 years for the 
sole purpose of conatructing, 
maintaining, and operating 
Student Recreation Facilities 
consisting of a swimming pool, 
jacuzzi, five racquetball/hand. 
ball courts, and a shower/locker 
room located just north of the 
Warren West rJeld, a jacuzzi at 
the Natatorium, and night 
lighting on the Muir Field, said 

Faci~ties to be governed by the 
Student Recreation Facilities 
Charter?" 

I t is estimated that the 
proposed facilities wiH cost 
$1,219,000 and will be paid for 
with an 11.5% Regents Loan. 
Based on an enrollment of 
10,000 students, the $6.50 fee 
will generate $195,000 
annually, of which $150,000 
win cover the payback of the 
loan, leaving $45,000 for 
annual maintenance and utility 
cosls. 

The loan will be fully paid in 
25 years; at the end of the 25-
year payback period, there will 
be a direct . all-student vote to 
approve a new fee level for 
continued maintenance and 
operation. 

This referendum question has 
been initiated, planned, and 
proposed by students working for 
student interests, with full 
professional and technical 
support.

'Edition': Special PerforDlances Not Material 
Special Editiun -Jack De 
Johnette (ECM) 

Considering the line-up on 
thi s dis c- drumm e r De 
Johnette , one of the best· 
rounded jazz drummers 
anywhere, alto saxist Arthur 
Blythe and tenor saxist and 
bass clarinetist David Murray , 
and bassist Peter Warren-
you would have thought it 
would have been a significant 
breakthrough record, one of 
those legendary sessions that 
chart new directions in the art. 
This ensemble, though, had no 
intentions of blazing any new 
trails , as the music stays safely 
in the boundaries of what 
we've heard before. 

confident tone which he 
sustains through the wildest 
stretches of his soloing, an 
unpredictable style that finds 
nuance and unexpectd inroads 
in a solo space. Blythe, on the 
other hand , exploits the alto 
sax for all it's worth, often 
changing moods from the 
whimsical and lyrical, to the 

s oulfully an guishe d . De 
Johnette plays solidly under 
their playing, rumbling like 
Philly Joe Jones one moment , 
accentuating hard-rock bass· 
drums another, and continual-
ly fragmenting and piecing 
back together rhythms as the 
music flows onward. Bassist 
Warren seems the odd man 

Which isn't to say that this 
record lacks spark. On the 
contr ary, Special Edition is 
fresh and lively, highlighting 
first·rate at the hands of Blythe 
and Murray. Throughout the 
disc, their instruments join in a 
variety of harmonic settings-
the fusion-tinged "One For 
Eric," the rhythm and blues riff 
of "Zoot Suit ," the ethereal 
texturizing on John Coltrane's 
tone poem " Indian-and at 
key points branch out to 
establish their own personali -
ties . Murray , alternating 
between tenor sax and bass 
clarinet, offers a strong, Cover for The Cramp'. new albl.811. 

De Johnette Brings 
Jazz to Old Globe 
One of World's Best Jazz Drummers 

Jack De Johnette , justifiably 
hai led by critics as one of the 
best modern jazz drwnmers in 
the world, will play with 
Special Edition Saturday, 
April 26 at 2:30 pm on the 
Old Globe Festival Stage in 
Balboa Park. 

De Johnette has brought his 
mercurial virtuosity to bear in 
his work with such modern 
jazz avatars as John Coltrane , 
Sonny Rollins , Miles DaVis, 
and Stan Getz . He has also 
extended his talents into the 
areas of jazz-rock fusion and 
avant-garde improvisation. 

He 's proven to ' be a 
malleable factor, blending a 
mainstream sense of pulse 
with freer forms. Solo efforts 
include Untitled , and New 
Rngs, both for ECM, 

Accompanying De Johnet· 
te will be Arthur Blythe, 
ingenious alto saxophonist 
who is perhaps the single most 
in.tinctive reed man to emerge 
in 10 years, and whose 
records Bush &bies and The 
Grip are boundless in their wit 
and exploratory imagination. 

Chico Freeman on sax, 
whose work has been highly 
regarded for years, Peter 
Warren on bass, a gifted 
musician whose abilities haa 
landed him stints with Phil 
Woods, John Abercrombie, 
Anthony Braxton and others 
will also appear with De 
Johnette. 

For ticket information, call 
231 -1941. 

The UCSD New Poetry 
Series will present Josephine 
Miles reading her work today 
at 4 pm in the Center for Music 
Experimentation, 408 Warren 
Campus. Free to public. 

Also tonight, the series will 
present Mexican poets Jose 
Emilio Pacheco and Jose Julio 
Chavezmontez, at CME, 7 
pm. 

Wednesday evenings at the 
Mandeville Auditorium will 
present SONOR, the UCSD 
Contemporary Music ensem· 
ble, at 8 pm, in the Mandeville 
Auc:litoriwn. New works by 
WiD Ogdon, Batachelte and 

Vic Hoyland will be 
performed, under the direction 
of Berna,'d Rands. 

Admission is $2.50 for the 
general public and $1. 50 for 

out here, maintaining a fairly 
conservative attitude as he 
backs the others dutifully, if 
not preceptively . Special 
Edition has mu c h to 
recommend it. Thoullh not 
profoundly origi'nal , it 
nonetheless cooks hard like 
the best jazz should. B plus . 
Sonlls The Lord Taught Us -
The Cramps (Illegal Records) 

On the cover, The Cr~s 
look like a cross between The 
Munsters and the Rocky 
Horror Picture Show , and on 
record their music sounds like 
the ersatz psychedelia of a bad 
60s youth movie (Riot On 
Sunset Strip, Psyche.Out): 

The absence of a bass 
player is unnoticeable, given 
the rest of the band members' 
collective incompetence, Mod 
Squad guitar solos and 
recommissioned mothballed 
rock cliches add a lot of 
eldritch squeals and howls to 
the cuts. 

In fact, the most refreshing 
tracks on this disc are the 
grooves between cuts. The 
Lord apparantlv didn't teach 
them how to play these songs 
properly. Perhaps a stint in 
Purgatory listening to surf 
music would be an appropriate 
refresher course. 

Jack De Johnette 
Local poet and prose writer 

Paul Dresman will read from 
his works as part of the 
Monday Night Poets Series at 
DG Wals Bookstore and 
Coffeeshop, at 7:30pm, 7527 

With song titles like "Mad 
Daddy," "Sunglasses Alter 
Dark," "Strychnine," and 
"Zombie Dance," I don't 
doubt that some people call 
this stuff New Wave. Yawn. ' 
call it old-hat. D. 

Fonnu/a -Lazy Racer (A&M) 
The title is the tipoff to what 

this record contains, wherein 
an earnest young band 
searches for that sound to put 
them over the top. Lessee, 
whatta we got here? Doobie 
Brothers? Steely Dan? Pablo 
Cruise? Yep, they're all here. 
The problem is that Lazy 
Racer jumps from style to style 
as if they were desperate-as 
though they .uspected their 
appropriated style. wouldn't 
work as well as they hoped. 

Some decent vocals and 
fairly competent soloing are 
found on these tunes, but the 
songs are so polished that the 
overall effect is immenently 
forgettable. Whde running in 
the vein of the aforementioned 
groups, Lazy Racer lacks 
complexity and hooks , which 
are essential for commercial 
success . If you hear a tune 
twice on the radio and can't 
hum it afterwards, it's going 
nowhere. C.

Ducks Attack 
UCSD Tonite 

Even before Three Mile Island made 
headlines, Duck's Breath Mystery 
Theater was hard at work on a nuclear 
diaaster film script... "larda: Cow from 
Hell!" may never make it to the silver 
screen but it's got a weat plot: 
When the night janitor accidently leaves 
the reactor door open at a nuclear power 
plant, a cow from the adjacent farm 
wanders into the reactor core and out 
comes Zarda ready to wreak terror across 
the fields of Iowa. Iowa? 
Well, Duck'. Breath comes from Iowa, 
but they've lived in the Bay area for much 
of their five year existence, and they've 
performed around the country as word 
continues to spread about their definitely 
warped approach to comedy and satire. 
Their material includes such immortal 
gems as "The Adventures of Ann 
Landers," "Zippy the Pinhead," 
"Transveative Farmers Assoc.," and 

-disco -hits- - "S.P.C.A.""- and Nacho 
Cheese." 
Through the group's Eaatba-.l' runs 
(usually at Berkeley's Live Oak Theatre) 
and other stands around the bay, Duck'. 
Breath has built up a near fanatical 
foUowing . at a recent Santa Cruz 
appearance people showed up dressed 
like ducks.

had vetoed this item last year, 
but acquieliced to sludent 
pret>sure to reinatate funding 
for this prowam in the 1980· 
81 budget, according to Dean 
Miller from the Deparbnent of 
Finance. 

This program, which 
focuses on biomass and 
energy conservation techno· 
logy I on a small scale, is 
important for sludents becauae 
it is one of the few sources of 
research funding available to 
students. The Assembly 
committee also requested that 
comprehensive plans be 
prepared for next year's 
budget hearings regarding 
graduate student enrollment, 
medical education , the 
university's research, and 
graduate and undergraduate 
student affirmative action. 

This budget will next be 
considered in the Assembly 
Ways and Means Committee 
chaired by Vasconcellos, 
which normally accepts the 
subcommittee's decisions. In 
late May, a joint conference 
committee composed of three 
senators and three assembly. 
men will meet to reconcile any 
conflicting appropriations 
made by the two houses in 
their independent hearings. 
Only the California Writing 
Project, and the teaching 
assistants will be exempt.

hardship we might have to 
face, we cannot let the 
government get away with 
this racist policy. 

1bese two weeks have 
been a political lesson for 
everybody, especially for the 
American students flere, too 
used to the apathy of their 
campuses. We don't know if 
we will win, but we can 
reasonably have good hopes, 

consid.ering the last fight, 
and considering that the 
professors, all the political 
parties (from the left, of 
course) and the trade unions 
are supporting us. 

Whatever the final 
outcome, it will remain that 
these two weeks have been 
the weeks of direct 
democracy, political action, 
solidarity and, yes , 
happiness!
