Improvement of Undergraduate 
Education before the Regents at 
UC Santa Barbara. The 
testimony was full of "students 
feel" and "students are now 
facing" and with 50 students 
crowded into the back of the 
room to protest the Regental 
position on investments and 
lack of position on ethnic 
studies, I sure hoped I was right 
about how students felt . 

Being on the SBPC puts you in 
an elitist position . Your travel is 
paid to meetings. you can go 
where other students cannot. 
you talk in casual conversation 
with people who make decisions 
for the State as well as the 
University . You are general ly set 
apart from other students. 

This example of the unethical 
conduct of certain faculty of the 
phYSics department leads us to 
believe that a cover-up , for 
whatever reason . is taking place . 
This is not only the opinion of 
mere students but is shared by 
Professor Booker. " I currently 
predict cover-up, followed by a 
continuation of present ad -
ministration poliCY." In the final 
analysis, we suspect that Saltman 
is covering up his investigation, 
its results , the proper corrective 
actions, and the ·extent of ad-
ministrative involvement in 
creating such problems. I n short,

Errata 
George Post's letter [TT, May 31] contained several errors. The 

sentence, "I am convinced that the historic manifestation of God in 
lesus to be the cornerstone of my faith that is really Christian," 
should have read, "of any faith that is really Christian." 

The third paragraph of the letter should have read, "This then can 
cause a person to conclude that the Bible is not historically true . 
However, logically , this is an error, since before one reaches the 
conclusion, one has already decided not to accept the occurrence 
of supernatural events." . 

The Triton Times regrets these errors. 

Dennis Pi rages Is Best 
Prof in Depart~ent 

I read with amazement . the 
article in Friday's Triton Times 
that Dr . Dennis Pirages was not 
being offered tenure . Of all the 
professors I have been subject to 
at UCS8. he certainly ranks 
among the finest. Within the 
political science aepartment he is 
without a doubt the best, making 
the others look I ike rhetoric 
spouting, soupbox simpletons. 
His lectures are organized and 
factual , and he is extremely 
articu late and open with his 
students 

Unlike most of his depart-
menta! contemporaries. Dr . 
Pirages generally avoids getting 
bogged down in personal political 
bias . and ob jectively presents 
material and astute criticisms . 
While some pseudo-liberal in-

tellectuals decry his rather 
concise testing methods. his 
classroom methodology is among 
the fairest and · most effective at 
UCSD. His approach to the 
discipline makes it more than just 
an easy A or a major for those 
who can't cut it in anything else . 

II seems bitterly ironic that the 
administration can release such 
an excellent instructor on the 
(abricated pretense of a research 
weakness , while maintaining 
professors in other disciplines 
(most notably the physics 
department) who have yet to 
teach an undergraduate course, 
or are virtually incapable of doing 
so 

Past Year's Accomplishments 
SBPC spends a great deal of 

its time reacting to the 
movements of the ild-
ministration. the Regents and 
the Legislature. but this past 
year has produced )ome of its 
own accomplishments Among 
those accomplishments are the 
Student Regent posi tion, the 
addition of a million dollars to 
financial aids from the 
Education Fee. and the in-
clusion in the Regents ' Budget 
of funds to eliminate the $45 fee 
for Subject A. 

In order to bring about those 
and other changes. SBP( does 
more than fly to meetings . 
Members of SBPC give 
testimony on different issues 
before the Regents . They meet 
outside of regular Regents' 
meetings in their area and with 
their campus administrators as 
well as administrators in 
University Hall. 

At first. I was impressed with 
the position of SBPC. Then I was 
disgusted . I have my doubts that 
some members of the SBPC ever 
see the disgusting Side of the 
Council. but most do . After 
disgust came opportunism. With 
a lot of hard work to uncover 
the facts, the SBPC position can 
be used.to affect change in the 
University. My only hope i$ that 
more students become aware of 
this and begin the c h.anges . 

$$ SECTION. $$ 
LEADERS NEEDED 

The University should Im-
mediately re-evaluate their 
perverted perspectives, before 
undergraduate education at 
UCSD becomes an even bigger 
farce than it already is If the 

~ros error that ha been com-
mitted in this particular case can 
be corrected . it should be done 
Immediately In any event . the 
suspect skill of either Chalfman 
Lakeoff or Vice -c hancellor 
Saltman pale Iwside the a -
compl ishments of Dr Pirages . 

Lobbyi ng with Regents , 
administrators and state of-
ficials is the prime clout of 
SBPC. SBPC members are the 
only students allowed In the 
back room of Regents meetings 
where di cuss ions occur bet-

Forbes held his post as Chairman 
since 1966, but after going on a 
sabbatical this year, decided to 
resign . Forbes is scheduled to 
head several PE committees , as 
well as teach . Hunt said Forbes 
wanted to do some things that he 
wouldn 't have a chance to do as 
Department Chairman. 

Hunt woJl stay with the same 
phrlosophical ideas that Forbes 

Hole ' Poles In the Carl Abosco League), Grabbers, and Tube Chasers 
were the B teams fo advance to Sunday's play 

The rrogs won a pair of 14-11 games to stay In the runnrng Old Bats

Department Chairman. and I'll 
keep dOing the same type of 
things that Ted was doing." 

Hunt said that an Assistant 
AthletiC Director will be named in 
the near future to help Sweet. 

"We're not In a hurry to chose an 
a~slstant now, although there are 
many well-qualif led people ready
