VO.lk Asks '$5 Million For Punch

UCSD Basketball Player 
Sues Opponent For Incident 

Peter Volk, the UCSD basket-
ball player who was punched in 
the face by an opponent during 
a game in February, recently 
filed Jl multi-million-dollar civil 
suit against the player and his 
coach and school. 

Volk is asking for $5 million 
damages from Azusa Pacific 
College basketball player Mike 
Berry, his coach Cliff Hamlow 
and tbe school itself. 

Because of the punch, Volk 
has suffered a fractured 
cheekbone, nerve damage on 
the right side of his face and 
vision problems with his right 
eye. 

Throughout the ensuing 
months, Volk has refused to 
comment on tbe matter. 

guard Tom Omalev. No foul 
was called on the play. 

Berry then ran down the 
court and punched Volk, wbo 
was guarding bim, just below 
the ri~bt eye. 

Volk was carried out of tbe 
gym on a stretcher and taken to 
Scripps Memorial Hospital , 
where he was treated for a 
fractured cheekbone and given 
10 stitches on the upper right 
side of his face. 

He then returned to tbe gym 
for the last few minutes of tbe 
game, which Azusa won. 

Berry was immed iate ly 
suspended for tbe playoffs by 
Hamlow. Azusa lost its fi rst 
playoff game. 

'Harassment' Protested 
Berry, originally charged in 

a criminal suit because of the 
punch, pled no contest to the 
charges in July. He was fined 
$250. 

Berry, Hamlow and Azusa 
are expected to deny the 
cbarges, and will probably 
come to trial in not less than two 
years. 

Berry, described in the Azusa 
Pacific press guide as " tough 
on the boards, ha rdnosed and 
an aggressive and emotional 
player," is no longer registered 
at Azusa. 

Not long after tbe game, be 
said in a letter to Hamlow, " I 
would give anything in my life 
to erase tbe incident. I apolo-
gize for the embarrassment 
caused to the (Azusa Pacific) 
team. I hope the incident is not 
tbe thing everyone remembers 
me by."

Approximately 20 people, 
protesting what they tenned 
harassment of union em-
ployees, set up an infonna-
tiona 1 picket line in front of the 
Graphics building on Matthews 
Campus Wednesday afternoon. 

The demonstration was held 
"because of numerous com-
plaints from Graphics em-
ployees concerning the working 
conditions there," Jim Stron-
ski, President o.f UCSD's 
chapter of the Association of 
Federal, State, County 
and Municipal Employees 
union (AFSCME) , said last 
ni,ht. . 

demonstration Wednesday and 
tbat Graphics bad never 
harassed any union employ-
ees. 

Powell said none of the 20 
people wbo picketed in front of 
Graphics from 12: 30 to 1: 00 
Wednesday were graphics 
employees. 

Stronski said no Graphics 
employees were allowed to Join 
the picket Hne because "there 
ts already enough pressure on 
them (Graphics employees) ." 

According to StroBski, 
AFSCME is attempting to 
unionize the entire campus, 
with the grapbics shop being 
one of the main target areas. 

Stronski said that last spring 
AFSCME held a meetinl of 

employees signed a petition 
ProtestiDl working conditions 
in tbeir shop. Since then, 
according to Stronski, two 
employees who 'signed the 
petition have received letters of 
"intent to dismiss," and two 
others have been harassed. 

Powell said that though two 
Graphics employees were 
being fired, it had nothing to do 
with their union activities. 

"Unions are a matter of 
choice," said Powell. "We have 
both union and .non-union 
factions in the shop. We do not 
discriminate." , 

Currently AFSCME is work-
ing with the University person-
nel Office concerning the two 
employees being fired. 

Volk's civil suit charges the 
defendants with assault and 
battery, negligence and inten-
tional infliction of emotional 
distress. 

The punch was thrown during 
tbe last 1977-78 regular season 
game , a game that Azusa 
needed to win in order to make 
tbe NAIA playoffs. 

Wben Berry was asked by a 
reporter in March ivr his 
reaction to tbe affair, he said, 
" I'm really sorry. I just kind of 
got out of band. It's a matter 
between me and Peter." 

Also speaking in March , 
UCSD coach Barry Cunning-
ham said, " Both players were 
bumping each other and Volk 
was trying to defense Berry. 
We work on this defense in 
practice. It shouldn't have led

'Maximize Student Vote' 

Registration Drive Set 
By Jolua Hondrot 

Auoelate New EdAlOJ' 
A voter re,istration drive 

aimed at "getting a lot of 
students registered" will take 
place at UCSD tomorrow, 
External Affairs Commis-
sioner Jim Lofgren said. The 
drive, which is a joint effort of 
student leaders from the AS 
and Re, Fee Committee, will 
be,in at 9 am in the North 
Conference Room of the Stu-
dent Center. 

According to Re, Fee Com-
mittee Chair Kenzie Nicoll, the 
drive fa beine oraanized to 
maximize the tudent vote in 
the upcomin, November .elec-
tion. 

The door to door re,istration 
drive wJll cover all on· and off-
campul Itudent houliq. 

"Re.istration cardl are very 

simple to fill out, tbere's no 
reason wby students should sit 
back," Nicoll said. 

According to a voter regis-
tration drive bookJet put out by 
the California Campus Coali-
tion, students who fall into one 
of tbe following categories 
should register to vote: 

- Anyone over 18 may 
re,ister to vote. In San Diego 
County, you may register to 
vote if you are 17 years old and 
will be 11 by the date of the 
election. 

- Under California election 
law, a person must be re,is-
tered to vote at his/ ber current 
address or he/sbe cannot 
le,ally cast a ballot; therefore, 
anyone who has moved since 
he/sbe lalt voted must re-
rell ter to vote at his/her new 
addreu. 

- If someone registered to 
vote in 1976, but did not vote in 
that election, his/ her name has 
been removed from the list of 
registered voters and must 
register again. 

- People who want to change 
their political party must re-
register to vote. 

The election law states that 
all students can register to vote 
at their college address . 
Students who re,ister to vote at 
their parents' address will bave 
to vO 'e by absentee ballot . 
Studer,ts have ,reater political

CommentarY- . 
County To Cut Emissions 

By RoIer Hed~k 
You can expect to be breathing c1eanfr air in 

the future as a result of an action taken by the 
County Board of Supervisors on Sept. 20. Acting 
as the Air Pollution Control Board for the San 
Diego Re,ion, we amended vapor reCovery 
rules to require 950/0 recovery of hydrocarbon 
vapors at ,as stations. Currently, more than 346 
tons per day of hydrocarbons (pollutants) are 
being emitted into the air we breath in San Diego 
County. This is a direct result of the daily 
consumption of more than 22,068,000 gallons of 
gas locally. 
Roter Hed,ecock represents &he Third DisUict 
on tbe San DleKo County ~ of Supervisors. 

The Federal government is now requiring that 
we substantially improve our air quality. By 
1987 the 346 ton average dally emission must be 
reduced by 118 tons. Th~ estimated cost of this 
effort II approximately $131,000,000. Vapor 
recovery is considered not only an integral part 
of this effort but a cost effective one reducing 
pollutants by more than 18.7 tons per day when 
the strategy is fully implemented. 

P~or to the Board action, the vapor recovery 
reqwrement was 90% but there were few 
systems installed and most did not meet the 
required recovery percentage. We now have 
available to us a second generation of vapor 
recovery aystems wbich are .ipificanUy better 
than the earlier systems. ~veral of tbem have 
been certified after extensive teatin, by our 
staff and the State Air Resources Board to 
recover over 95"0 of bydrocarbon vapors at the 
las pump. 

The Federal government is furtber mo· 
tivatin,local government to clean up their air in 
the 1m amendments to the Clean Air Act. 
Deadlines for formulating, adopting and 
submitting plans to attain and maintain air 

quality standards have been set. The San Dieao 
Air Quality Maintenance Plan which includes 
the 95% vapo.r recovery rule, bas be'eD 
completed and ia currently being reviewed by 
the public and local agencies. It must be 
submitted to the state next month for inclUlion 
in the State Implementation Plan whicb will be 
forwarded to the Environmental Protection 
Agency. 

To add muscle to tbese requirements, federal 
funding to local agencies for highways, sewer 
projects and other grant funded activities wil be 
withheld unless the requirements are met. 
Presently, the upgrading and expanaion of two 
sewage treatment plants at San Elijo and 
Encina are delayed due to the Federal 
government attaching air quality conditions to 
federal funding of these projects. 

What does the 950/0 vapor recovery require-
ment mean? As a result of recently approved 
state Jegislation, a service station operator is 
required to install and properly maintain and 
operate a vapor recovery system which has 
been certified by tbe Air Resources Board to 
recover at least 95% of hydrocarbon vapors. In 
the event that tbe installed equipment fail. to 
recover at this rate, the station owner is not held 
responsible. Aa a result, there will be a one time 
only cost of installing a vapor recovery aystem. 

The implementation proeram is a reasonable 
one.. It will DOt require all stations to iDatall 
vapor recovery .yatems immediately. The Air 
Pollution Hearin, Board will eltabUsb aD 
implementation scbedule aimed at achieviDI 
equitable treatment on a cue by case baais. In 
determining when a station owner mUll iDataJJ a 
vapor recovery aystem, they will conaider the 
previous efforts of the owner to comply with 
vapor recovery replatlona, the size of the 
operation, the financial ability of the operator to 
comply and.tbe availability of equipment.

Issac Singer Wins 
Literature Nobel 

By Bill AlkinlOn 
Anocla&ed Press Writer 

MIAMI - "I didn' t write for 
prizes - but since it came I 
take it like a man," Isaac 
Bashevis Singer said shortly 
after he was notifi~ yesterday 
he was the winner of the 1978 
Nobel Prize for literature. 

The 74-year·old Jewish novel-
ist and short story writer 
expressed astonishment when 
told by a reporter of the award. 

" I'm grateful, but at the 
same time I am sorry that 
writers greater than I did not 
get it," he said. 

Asked what led him to 
become a writer, Singer said 
his father had done some 
writing, as had his brother and 
sister, both now dead. 

" I took a piece of paper and a 
pen and pencil and I tried to 
scribble' ... there is no other 
way," he said. " I was very 

much inspired as a boy when I 
read Sherlock Holmes by 
Conan Doyle. 

" After I read one of those 
stories I decided also to write a 
detective story. This was my 
beginning - I threw the story 
away later," he chuckled. 

"The wastebasket is a writ-
er's best friend , I often say." 

Singer settled in New York 
after leaving his native Poland 
43 years ago. He writed in 
Yiddish but said he edits the 
English versions of his work. 

He was interviewed at his 
condominium in the Miami 
area, where he spends several 
months a year. 

"No writer .writes for 
prizes," Singer said. 

"Tolstoy was a candidate and 
some other writer got it ... so 
the prize, while it's pleasant to 
get it, it doesn't prove, really, 
so much," he said.

OOIenrile Eappd is about a 
man whose only enduri~g

The production of this play at 
the Carter Center Stage has two 
major flaws. The first is that 
Hench, played by Jim Sullivan, 
becomes too emotionally in-

there was a completely disin-

Hench. 

The second problem .with the 
Carter's version, which was 
directed by William Roesch, is 
that it ulUlecessarily becomes a 
salute to Wagner. Preswnably, 
this is because the real theme of

By Jon GoelZ 
Stalf Wriler 

Displaying their finest ball-
handling skills yet this season, 
the TritOll soccer team battled

The first half ended in a 0.0 
stalemate, thinks In part to

"In tbe first part of the second

and stringing tbinga together. " 

Sam Tam cbe8t-trapped a

past lOIIle Biola oppoaents and 
passed 8C1'OII the field to

Success orientation for 
athletes? Why do college 
athletes need success orien-
tation? Isn't being able to 
handle academic pressures and 
pa,..:_,pate on a team suc-
... c:SSfulln itself? 

Bob Moss, UCSD physical 
education instructor known for 
his "Psychology of Sports 
Officiating" class will try out 
his innovative idea on Tuesday, 
October 10, at 8 pm in a session 
entiUed "Success Oreintation 
for UC8D Athletes." 

The purpose of this two bour 
session is to expose student 
athletes (or any Interested 
students or faculty) to a variety 

of ideas and techniques 
designed to enhance the quality 
of both individual and team 
success. Moss will also 
familiarize students with the 
broad spectrum of student 
supportive services available 
through the campU5 OASIS 
program. 

How will Moss achieve this ? 
"I've put together this program 
to share some of my ideas and 
techniques that I've utilized in 
the past with my own Moss-Cess 
(as in success) method," 
disclosed Moss. 

Moss uses the concept of 
"creative visualization" to 
increase the confidence and 
skills of his students. "I worked 
with a former UC8D student, 
Randy Miller, who JUJtthis year 

was called up from the mIn.or 
leagues to pitch several games 
for the EXpos. I had him go over 
to the stadiwn one night and in 
total darkness ptch a game to 
imaginary players, visualizing 
each pitch, each moment of 
pressure, each challenge that" 
he would have to face in a real 
game." Moss feels that this 
tatic aids in " developing and 
maintaining a slight com-
petitive edge in the face of 
defeat. " 

Included in Tuesday's 
program will be a panel 
discussion by UC8D students 
concerning success and how 
they bave achieved it. The 
discussion will be followed by a 
showing of Tommy Lasorda's 
film "You Gotta Believe."

"We needed a momentum 
booster," conunented Bergado. 
which came about in the second 
and third gama. u the Tritons 
rallied to 15-9 and 15-6 triumphs. 
Unfortunately, the fourth game 
was lost, 12-15 when UCSD 
failed to break Point Loma's 
successful drive. 

The action1>8cked fifth game 
provided the crowd with a 
similar drive by the TrItons. 
Supplying her teammates with 
sets, Dawn Wilson played an 
impressive final game. Besida 
Wilson, Bergado and Brather 
fonned a strong defensive pair. 
netting six well-eamed points. 
Other point·winning plays were 
provided by spikes from Wright

game wu "too close." UCSD 
failed to launch their attack 
Wltll the score became tied by 
the mpeful Point Loma offense. 
"We play our best under 
pressure," remarked Wilson. 
ConvinCingly enough, the 
Tritons explosively battled and 
regained the lead Due to the 
skillful defensive work of the 
team, U~D swept to victory in 
their first Ie8SOn match. 

"Our technique during 
practice hu given 111 the ad-

sharpened up our play quite a

CHARLESTON. W. Va. (AP) 

- Night watchman Robert 
Hanson says he always carries 
a small New Testament In. his 
shirt pocket because " it gives 
me strength." Police say that 
on Thursday it saved his lile. 

As Hanson was making his 
final rounds before dawn in the
