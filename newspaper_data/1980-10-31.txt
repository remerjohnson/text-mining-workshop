With the coming of Halloween today, hundreds of ma~ure UL'SD stude~ts will regr~ss to 

their childhood by donning outrageous costumes and gOing door to door trlck-or-treatang. A 
highlight of toda'y' fe tivities include a pumpkin carving conte. t on Revelle Plaza at noon and 
the annual Muir College pumpkin drop off of Tioga Hall, al so at noon. 

Rutnor of Muir fire alartn 
death false, but potential exists 

A rumor was widely 
c-irculated in the Muir College 
dorms ye terday that a fire 
truck re ponding to a Tioga 
Hall fire alarm hit a mall car 
and killed two of it 
occupants. 

The rumor is "totally 
untrue,'.' according to a San 
Diego Fire Department 
spokesman. . 

But he pointed out that the 
potential for uch an accident 
while answering one of the 
numerous false fire calls at 
Muir College is "extremely 
great." 

The spokesman said that 
the rumor was most likely 
spurned by factual news 
reports that a fire truck 
responding from the East~ate 
Mall station had colltded 
with a pick·up truck at the 
intersection of Genesee 
Avenue and La Jolla Villag.e 

Drive on Oct. 19. Two of the 
pick· up's pa engers were 
killed , 

The fire truck, weighing 
52,000 pounds and traveling 
about five mpp, collided with 
the light pick·up truck, 
which entered the inter ee· 
tien at about 40 mph. 

"Not much was left of the 
pick· up's front end," the 
spokesman said. 

According to Dan Under· 
berger, a Muir hou e advi or, 
residence hall personnel are 
keeping a special watch for 
false alarms tripped this 
weekend. 

And Muir Assistant 
Resident Dean Erik Mellby 
has said tliat a fire 
department official told him: 
"I II personally see to it that 
anyone caught tripping a 
false a larm pends six 
months in jail." 

Cafe staff .~repares 
to combat food war' 

Revelle Cafeteria will be 
transformed into a "high 
security area" tonight as food 
service and residence hall 
personnel attempt to quelch 
any repetition of 1978' 
legendary Halloween food 
fight. 

During the culinary· 
confrontation two year ago, 
the new cafeteria carpet was 
badly soiled and several large 
windows were broken - all 
at a cost of $2000 to 
participants in the kirmish. 

According to Ron ook a 
Revelle resident advisor, 
plan to Quell "any

insurrection " in the 
cafeteria include the staging 
of a Halloween co tume 
contest. "We hope this will 
keep their attention on the 
stage and off of throwing 
food." 

As wa done last year, meal 
card will be collected and 
filed as tudent enter the 
cafeteria. Cook aid that if 
there is a food fight, the cards 
"won't be returned until the 
mes is cleaned up." 
The entree for dinner is 
shrimp, a food "that L fairly 
hard to throw," Cook said. 

"We'r puttm~ out good 
Halloween fare,' said on 
cafeteria worker. Th m 
candy and des 'erts will 
compliment the aerodynami· 
cally unsound shrimp.

plan to cov r the vulnerable

But he ayshei running into

problem getting the idea 
approved, although he feels

in a false alarm.

'Two-faced assholes' 
still dominate ballot 
Editor: 

For the past two centuries, 
Americans have held the 
distinction of living in the 
first c.ountry in modern 
history to adopt the 
democrat ic process of 
majority rule as its governing 
principle. Although well 
organized and richly 
endowed minorities have 
often thwarted that process, 
majority rule has seemed so 
strongly entrenched ' rhat, 
during the 60's and the 70's 
many abused and neglected 
minorities were vigorously 
demanding concrete assur-
ances of equal rights under 
the law_ Certainly, no one 
would ever have claimed that 
the majority were intrinsical-
ly under-represented. 

Most voters. then. would 
probably be astonished to 
discover that there presently 
exists within the electorate a . 
majority froup ·of 53.4 
percent 0 the populace 
whose members constitute 
only 1 percent of the Senate, 
3_6 percent of the House, 9.3 
percent of state legislatures. 
and 1.1 percent of federal judgeships. In addition, no 
members of this majority 

• have eoter been appointed to 
the Supreme Court; only five 
have served in the Cabinet; 
and, of course, none have ever 
been elected to the office of 
President or Vice-President_ 
Finally, this majority group 
has been so under-represent-
ed since the beginning of the 
republic that its members 
were extended the franchise 
only as recently as 1920. 

their numbers, women are 
historically the most 
systematically oppressed 
people on the entire planet. 

The cruel irony of the 
situation stems from the fact 
that the subjugators of 
women are t he very people 
who most passionately 
declare their love for them -
men. In poetry, music and 
art, men celebrate women's 
virtues but, when confronted 
by the prospect of women 
liberating themselves from 
status of property to that of 
equality. men become as limp 
as wet dish-towels. 

Apparently, men fear what 
they most desire - a trait 
which a dear friend from the 
Conscientious American 
Ladies Bureau (CALB) 
acribes to men's almost 
innate propensity to behave 
like "two-faced assholes." 
Envious of and threatened by 
womankind's life-affirming 
sense of intimacy and 
integration with the 
reproductive miracle, men 
approach their environment 
as alien, .death-dealing, 
autistic children whose frail 
egos must constantly assert 
their barren virility in a 
compulsively self-destruct ive 
game of one-upsmanship. 
The world-wide history of 
patriarchy and its attendant 
culture of gratuitous violence 
would indeed lend credence 
to this theoretical conjecture 
if men only dared to probe 
beneath the surface of their 
psyches. 

In this Presidential 
election year, men again 
monopolize the ballot despite 
the fact that women have

AP article failed to mention 
nature of IRA 'conviction' 
Editor: 

The AP article on the 
hun~er strike by Irish 
politIcal prisoners in Belfast 
(Daily Guardian , Oct. 28) 
stated that the prisoners 
were "convicted IRA 
guerrillas." It is unfortunate 
that the nature of their 
"conviction," documented by 
amnesty International, was 
nowhere mentioned. 

These men were tried in 
special no-jury courts. They 

are among 400 political 
prisoners, some 90 percent of 
whom were "convicted" 
(according to AI) olely on the 
basis of confessions signed 
under torture (also documen-
ted by AI). 

It is finally worth noting 
that the prisoners, both those 
presently on a AU nger strike, 
and thosewhointend to begin 
one in the coming weeks, 
would all currently have 
political prisoner status if the 

English government had not 
revoked it in 1976. According 
to the English, an}:one"con-
victed" of a political offense 
after March I of that year is 

mer~ly a "common crimi· 
nal. 

It is a strange judicial 
system, indeed, which 
dispenses with juries, relies 
on forced . confessions, and 
determines the political 
nature of offenses by a 
calendar.

Finally, your belief that

Editor: 
Name calling, appealing to 

the emotions, not the 
intellect, and downright 
vulgarity has of late been the 
style of campaigning by some 
of the prtlCarter people. They 
obviously find it nearly 
impossible to specify the good 
points of their candidate, or 
else they wouldn't be taking 
such a low road in trying to 
influence others to vote for 
their candidate. We can only 
hope that this type of debate 
will not continue. Let us not 
stoop so low and approach the 
issues on that level, but 
rather let us look at the two 
issues that affect college 
students the most: draft 
registration and inflation_ 

With regard to the draft, it 
is a fact, as everyone kno\>tS. 
that President Carter has 
reinstated draft registration. 
As Mr. Carter freely admitted 
after the invasion of 
Afghanistan. it was only then 
that he awakened to the fact 
that the Soviets do pose a 
threat. After discarding the 
8-1 bomber. the neutron 
bomb and finally realizing 
the weakness that has 
characterized his Adminitra-
lion's foreign policy, 
President Carter intends on 
remedying the situation by 
imposing draft registration. 
If he does that in an election 
year, can a peacetime draft 
be far away? Former 
GoYemor Reagan, on the 
other hand, opposes not only 

a peacetime military draft, 
but also (quoting his official 
position paper) states, " .. .I 
oppose the establishment of a 
stand-by registration system, 
which would not ~eatly 
speed US mobilization in 
time of an emergency, would 
require a .Iarge, costly 
bureaucracy, and would be 
seen - quite likely, 
accurately - as a tJrst step' 
toward a peace-time draft. ' 
Mr. Reagan also believes that 
the current Salt II treaty, 
which would ad~ a minimum 
of 3000 nuclear warheads to 
the Soviet arsenal and launch 
the US on a $35 billion catch-
up program, should reduce, 
not increase nuclear arms 
capabilities . President 
Carter. a Democrat. could not 
even get this treaty ratified 
by the Democrat-controlled 
Senate. 

Inflation is an economic ill 
that hurts the poor the most. 
Under Mr. Carter's Adritinis-
tration. we have had inflation 
as high as 20 percent. Even 
now inflation is above 12 
percent. Mr. Reagan believes 
that restraining both federal 
spending and the increase in 
the ' money supply will 
remedy a situation that isout 
of control. Under the 
previous Republican Adm~n­
Istration inflation was only 4 
percent when Mr. Carter 
took offee. 

When Mr. Carter ran for 
the presidency in 1976. he 
created an index which he 

. called the "Misery Index." 
This was computed by 
adding the inflatron rate to 
the rate of unemployment. In 
1976 we had a misery index of 
12. and Mr Carter said that 
no president who would 
allow a rate that high should 
be elected. Today the misery 
index is 20, and perhaps it is 
time we give Mr. Carter his 
·wish .

The absence of logic is 
usually the cause of grave 
effl)fS, examples of which 
can be extracted from your 
last letter. First of all, let's 
straighten out the matter of 
your attack on Wilkinson's 
truisms (The Daily Guard· 
ian. Oct 15). Your shallow 
comparisons of life to tea 
parties and blood and sweat 
are as trite as 'his statement,

Maria became an industri· 
al homeworker after quitting 
a large Silicon Vall ey 
electronics corporation to 
have her first child. While at 
home a friend referred her to 
a woman who asked if she 
wanted to work as a stuffer. 
The work would be on a cash 
basis. she was told . No taxes 
would be withheld and there 
would be no benefits. She 
would go to her boss's home 
to pick up the parts and then 
return the tinished circuits 
after she had assembled 
them. Pay was by the piece, 
ranging from 75 cents,up to 
$3.50 for more compltcated 
boards. The woman onl y 
wanted full -time people. 

For over a year-and-a·half 
Maria worked eight hours a 
day, seven days a week. and 
occasionally 10 hours a day. 
She received overtime only 
on rush jobs. and though 
promised a raise many times, 
ne\Ter received one. 

At one point her boss called 
a meeting at her home which 
was attended by Maria and 
more than 50 of her co· 
workers. The contractor wa 
angry and claimed that the 
workers weren't doing 
careful enough work. She 
said that henceforth they 
would have to test and clean 
their own boards, and they 
would be paid less if there 
was something wrong. 

After that meeting. Maria 
began working with a pot of 
industrial solvent with she 
kept heated on her stove. The 
solvent was used to clean the 
finished circuit boards and 
rid them of excess solder. 

According to Robin Baker, 
director of the Department of 
Labor-funded Project on 
Health And Safety in 
Electronics (PHASE), "My 
first reaction when I heard 
about this was that I was 
totally sick to my stomach 
thinking about these women 
working at home. with pots of 
solvent boiling on the stove 
and kids running through the 
kitchen. The potential for 
exposure to families is really 
ou trageous.·' 

Karla Lupi, PHASE's 
technical assistance director, 
added that solvents such a N 
Butyl Acetate •. which are 
commonly u sed in the 
electronics industry, have a 
wide variety of toxic effects: 
"Eye and nasal irritation. 
drying out of the skin which 
can lead to variou types of 
dermati tis, respiratory tracl 
irritation. and headaches. 
nausea and dizzines are all 
common with solvent use," 
she claimed. "It is safe to 
assume that there is the 
pos ibility of chronic damage 
to the liver and kidney wi th 
the exp,osure to most 
solvents .•

Staf1 writer Andrew Keeler surveyed local 
record stores to come up with this comparison to 
A.S. Sorted Vinyl. The records were chosen to 
represent new single and double albums, single 

and double album in release for several years. 
and Elvis Co tello because his records are usually 
cl)eaper than other major releases. 

A.S. Sorted Vinyl averages out the cheapest, at 

$7.41 for the five, including the two double 
albums. UTC's Where house is the most 
expensive, at an average of $9.69. See story 
below. 

A.S. Sorted Vinyl keeps promise 
Offers competitive prices in area for its records 

When the A sociated Students 
allowed five "core members" to open a 
record co-op store on campus last year, 
many were skeptical that the music 
outlet would be just another high· 
priced university enterprise. 

But. surprisingly enough, those 
with doubt s were wrong. According to 
a recent Daily Guardian survey of 
local record retailers. the A.S. Sorted 
Vinyl co-op has consistently lower 
record prices overall. 

"We have a low overhead and we 
can keep prices down ," explains Rob 
Strom. one of the co·op·s core 
members. "We're intrested in making 
enough money to keep it (the store) 
running and to serve the students, not 
in making a big profit." 

The original funding for the store 
came from the AS's busines account. 
At the end of Spring quarter, A.S. 
Sorted Vinyl showed a deficit. but

Strom i confident that there will-be a 
profit by the end of thi- year. 

Along with Strom, Daryl Otti, Ondi 
Lingerfelter. Doug Morrill and Darcy 
Mobraatan s hare store organizational 
duties. / 

There are bet ween 20 and 30 
member of the co·op who put in at 
least two hours a week at the tore. In 
return for their efforts, members 
receive a 10 percent di count on all 
albums and tapes. 

"We encourage students to attend 
our meetings and join t he co-op," says 
Strom. Meetings are Wednesdays at 4 
pm. The store's business hours are 
Monday through Friday. 10 am to 5 
pm. 

After getting off to a slow tart last 
pring, A.S. Sorted Vinyl ha come on 
trong with the support of the 

students. Strom i encouraged with 
their response. "We've had a lot of 

repeat cu tomers and the word about 
uur low price has gotten around." 

-The bu lk of their bu iness come 
f rom the sale of new and u ed record . 
On an average day, 50to60albums are 
sold. Although the store may not have 
an extensive selection of albums. in 
stock. almo t any album is avai lable 
through a special order. 

Orders usually take two to three 
days and there is no~dditional charge. 
"I have noticed that student are 
willing to wait an extra day or two for 
an order, than go pay a higher price 
somewhere else." Strom says. 

Another attraction the student ·run 
store offeJs is the low·cost used 
album. Strom estimates that bet ween 
200 and 300 albums are in the racks at 
any ,given time. Used records range 
from $2·3 each, ·Student are 
encouraged to bring in their old or 
unwanted albums for cash or credit. 

Along with rock albums, A .. 
Sorted Vinyl offers jazz. reggae. and 
country records. Plans are being made 
to set upa section for classical albums. 
Imports are also available and u ually 
run about 75 cent more than

A.S. Sorted Vinyl has been running 
weekly specials on albums and they

ago as a humorous look at 
two archetypal collegians -
Michael j. Doonesbury and 
B.D. - ha s ea rned a 
reputation for biting satire 
that focuses on anyone in the 
cultural limelight - from 
politicials, journalists and 
aut hors to television shows, 
football and lifestyle trends. 

Trudeau. now 32, began 
his work on a comic strip 

Inflation 

with "Bull Tale," carried in 
the late '60s by the Yale Daily 
News. The strip was spotted ' 
and renamed by james F. 
Andrews and john P. 
McMeel, the founders of-
UPS, which distributes the 
strip to 600 newspapers 
in this country and abroad. 

Initially, 28 newspapers 
signed up for "Doonesbury."

Doonesbury

Helped by the comic strip" 
reputation for irreverence 
and 'brashness, thenumberof 
c lients grew s teadily , 
attracting a young and 
eOucated readership. 

The comic strip ha s 
frequently been the center of 
controver, y and ha rectived 
considerable allent ion for its 
treatments of John Mitchell, 

n . John Warner, Gov . 
Edmund Brown, Jr., and, just 
this week, presidential 
candidate Ronald Reagan . 
The comic st rip has also 
blazed n ew Irail s by 
introducing a gay character 
and exploring the lifestyle of 
si ngle people, 

Trudeau remains a shy, 
reticent individual , and has 
stated that he prefers to let 
hi work do t he speaking for 
him .

JOHN GAVIN 

Silicon Valley 
continued from page 4 
assembly workers because of 
speed and cost savings on 
this final production stage 
which cannot easily be 
automated. However, the 
"speed" of home assemblers 
is frequently traceable to long 
hours and low pay. A small 
group of women working in a 
living room or a garage can 
often do more boards than 
employees working in 
factories, given similar 
expenditures. 

The work is frequently 
passed from a large 
corporation through everal 
subcontractors before it 
finally reaches the low·paid 
home a semblv workers. 

. Not all Silicon Valley 
corporations use subterrane· 
an workers, but cutthroat 
competition, la ck of 
unionization and the 
multinational character of 
the semiconductor industry 
has created great pres ures 
to cut labor costs, 

The _ industry executive 
who are willing to talk about 
the practice claim that ,it is 

the only way they can hold 
their own with foreign 
competitors, However, tho e 
involved in policing the 
industry, like PHASE 
director Robin Baker, are 
skeptical about such claims. 

'They're really uptight 
about the Japanese and that's 
become an excuse for 
everything. They say, 'if the 
damn workers didn't ask for 
so much money and so many 
protections, then we could 
compete, but we're being 
dragged down by the horrible 
demands of workers.' It'~ a 
ridiculous argument." 

And AI Rieff, the Deputy 
Chief of the State Depart· 
ment of Labor Standards 
Enforcement, who recently 
confirmed that his division i 
conducting an inve tigation 
of the industry, feel that 
business claims are often 
overstated. The wage rates, 
he says, "are an economic 
factor of doing business in 
the United States. We have 
higher wages and as a 
consequence we should 
produce better product ," • 

Spock still going strong 
continued from page 1 

"There are a lot more parents 
nowadays that '" are hesitant 

,about taking control because 
they're afraid they might do or 
say the wrong thing. When 
children see that, they will take 
full advantage of it. [have found 
through my experiences that if 
the parent is firm in his or her 
position, the children accept it. 

"When parents are hesitant J 
don't think they're aware of it, 
but when they're doing it, it 
alienates the child. The parents 
should have no hesitations about 
telling Ihe child exactly where 
they stand. 

"But the key to doing that," 
the doctor con ti nued," is doing it 
in a positive way. The parent 
doe n't have to be oppressive, 
just definite." 

He went on to talk about how 
professionals came into the 
scene of raising children and 
their contribution. in. the rield, 

"Before my book came out, 
child raisi ng was mainly limited 
to the extent of the family, but 
since then, the field has 
expanded into a science. One f 
the effects not anticpated by the 
profesionals, though, was the 
uncertainty of the parent. 

"Many of the theories 
professionals practice these 
days, are mainly all the tltings 
Freud and Thomas Dewey said. 
The best way to communicate 
something to a chi ld is not 

thro~~h intimidation, but with 
love, 

Spock then turned his 
attentton to the problems or 
society and the violence and 
delinquency among America' 
youth today. 

"The US is way behind 
Europe in having mechanisms or 
re cuing the neglected and 
deprived children. There hould 
be something done. " 

"Americans on the surface are 
affable people, but I think it's a 

ick society we Ih'e in. J think 
it's sick because it's too 
materialisti . too competitive. 
Our belief in material things is 
doing much mor harm than 
good." 

pock spent much of his 77 
years growing up in New York, 
whcih, he explain ·, ;;howed him 
much of the delin(j\lCncy among 
children and society. And he i~ 
not a stranger to expressing hiS 
\'iews out right.
