WAS HINGTON - "Atten-
tion a ademics: Change all 
locks on college laboratory 
doors and don't let visiting 
commie professors out of your 
sigh!!" 

While Ad m. Bobby R. 
Inman, deputy director of the 
CIA, stopped -hort of such 
specific advice to academic 
scienti ts la t week, universi · 
ties may have to conform to 
such government · impo 'ed 
constraint in the future if 
they want to host visiting 

oviet scienti t . 
In an effort to reduce the 

flow of information -
technical or otherwise - to 
the East, the State Depart· 
ment and the in telligence 
community have recently been 
engaged in a bizarre campaIgn 
to monitor and restrict the 
activities of visiting oviet 
scholar. Not . urpri ingly, the 

tate has offered no firm 
eVidence that such visitations 
have caused irreparable harm 
to U interest. 

La t week, the most recent 
tus Ie between "national 
security" and "academic 
freedom" climaxed when the 
State Department cancelled, 
as too risky, the visit of a 
Soviet robotics expert. 
Nickolai V. tlmnov, to four 
univrrsities. The deci s ion 
came three months after 
Stanford, Ohio State and the 
University of Wi conslO 
refused to conform to State 
Department guidelines for 
Umnov's tour. 

The re ·trict ions - which 
would have limited mnov to 
the st u dv of "mechan Ica l 
theorv of 'robotic locomotion " 
and cienied him acce.s to any 
Pentagon research projects on 
campu ses (classifIed or not)-
represented , according to Ohio 

tate's Edwin Crawford, "a 
tot al break from the pattern by 
which re earch has Improved 
and progressed t h roughou t the 
years. " 

"[t's ' imply inappropriate 
for a university such as ourf, to 
police Soviet scientists," 
added Camden A. Coberly. 
as"ociate dean of the 
Universitv of Wisconsin's 
College 'of Engineering. 
Coberly told our reporter John 
Riccardi that "not only do we 
lack the facility to do so, but 
everything we do here is open 
to the public anyway." 

Though the State Depart -
ment eventually eased its 
restrictions for Umnov's tour 
- and then cancelled the trip 
entirely - Uncle am 's 
diplomatic posturing is 
unnecessary and misguided. 

To begin with, a oviet 
"walking machine '" expert 
has been in re idence at 

tanford since September, 

with the full kn{)\\Iedge of the 
State Department. Umnov. 
meanwhile. "i not a big player 
in the world of robotics ," 
according to Lanford 
engineering profe. sor Bernard 
Rot h. Visit ing Russ ians, he 
noted, are "more interested In 
sitting around the pool ogling 
women than in stealing 
information. Everyt hing we 
have is already well· known to 
them" 

Wit hUm nov' \' I I I 
scru bbed, it seems safe to ay 
that the Russian wa. unfairly 
singled out as "the heavy" m 
the administration' "technol-
ogy tran fer" morality play. 

What's unfortunate, 
however, i s that the 
intelligence community 
doesn't see that it stand to 
gain - not lose - from the U . 
Soviet cholar exchange 
programs. At t he very least. 
exchanges offer a chance to 
observe Soviet scientists and 
their capabilities under the 
controlled setting of an 
American univers ity. 

It would be tragic, moreover, 
if a I a s h re ponse to 
characters , uch as Umnov 
earns us a reciprocal snub. "If 
you turn off the fau cet over 
here, there's no way you can 
expect it to be kept open over 
there," , aid Edwin Crawford. 

If the Russians close their 
portals to American social and 
politi ca l scientists, our 
dangerou<;ly primiti\'e level of 
under"landing of Soviet 
foreign policy deciSIOn will 
o nl y dec line further . A 
February report by the well-
respected Int e rnation a l 
Research and Exchanges 
Board ([REX ) in New York . 
which hponsors man y U -
USSR exchanges, notes that 
the Soviets have three times as 
many specialists studying S 
foreign policy as vice versa. 

Robert Levgo ld. Soviet 
"pecialist wit h the counci l on 
Foreign Relations , recently 
painted a gnm picture for The 
New York Times : " We have no 
study of the evolution of oviet 
policy toward SALT since the

SignIficant s tudy of oviet

and, most amazingly, no even 
moderately ambitious study of 
Soviet policy toward the US 
over the last decade."

1958 nuclear weapon accident 
revealed in federal documents 

By DAVID KAPLAN 
P aci fk Nt" ~\ !oo Sen it"C' 

New evidence obtained from 
federal documents reveals that 
a serious nuclear weapons 
accident occurred at a US Air 
Force base in Nort h AfricaJan. 
31. 1958, triggered a large-
scale evacuation of the area 
and resu lted in US military 
per onnel tracking plutonium 
across parts of Morocco. 

Although the Pentagon now 
confi rms that the accident did 
occur, it den ies that it wa 
serious and refuses to ident ify 
the location "due to diplomatic 
consideration ." Moroccan 
officials reached for comment 
were unaware of any uch 
event. 

The accident occurred at a 
US Strategic Air Command 
base at Sidi Slimane, Morocco, 
about 90 mi les northea t of 
Rabat. According to the 
document, obtained by the 
Center for Investigative 
Reporting and Pacific New 

ervice, a B-47 bomber loaded 
with a fu lly armed nuclear 
weapon crashed during a 
training exercise and burned 
for seven hours. 

Rescue crews bu IIdozed the 
wreckage to the s ide of the 
runway, leaving the high ly 
radioa cti ve aircraft parts 
exposed. A large number of 
vehicles and aircraft later 
were contaminated with 
radiation . 

Rumor s of a nuclear 
weapons accident somewhere 
in North Africa have persisted 
for 20 years. Two years ago the 
Pentagon released an abridged 
description of the event as one 
of its summaries of "broken 
arrow," of nuclear weapons 
accidents. T he Air Force 
admi ts in the broken arrow 
docume nt s that a B· 47 
carrying a nuclear weapon " in 
trike configuration" cras hed 

Jan. 31, 1958, at an unnamed 
Strat e~ i c A ir Comma nd 
"Reflex' ba e. Reflex bases 
were US strategic airfields 
located in the United Ki ngdom 
and French Morocco, accord-
ing to defense experts. 

According to t he Pentagon's 
account, "The aircraft caught 
fire and burned for seven 
hours. Firemen rought the fin' 
for t he alloted 10 mi nutes," 
and th n "evacuated the 
area." Therewas no explosion, 
although t he report notes that 
"(radioactive) cont amination 
of t he wreckage was high." 

Despite nu merous req uests, 
the Pent ago n refused to 

identify the country in which 
the accident occurred. 
According to Lt. Col. Mark 
Foutch of t he Department of 
Defense, "The country has 
remained unidentified due to 
diplomat ic con iderations ." 

Two days after the accident, 
an account appeared in The 
New York Times about the 
crash of a B·47 born ber on a 
runway at Idi Slimane. The 
Times report quoted military 
, ource saying it had been "a 
normal accident," but noted 
that Air Force officia ls had 
taken the u nu u al step of 
ordering the immediate 
evacuation of everyone within 
a distance of one mi le of the 
base. 

Base aut horities, according 
to the Times, denied there wa 
any nuclear danger but merely 
"considered the moment 
opportune to carry out a fu ll-
fl edged evacuat ion dri ll .' 

A closely matched account 
of the accident also appears in 
another govern ment documen-
t, a training manual prod uced 
by Rey nolds Electrica l & 
Engineering Co., under 
contract with the US 
Department of Energy's 
Nationa l Test Site. The 
manual is used to train 
worker to handle radiation 
acc idents . While not pinpoint-
ing the date or place of the 
accident, the account refers to 
a broken arrow involving the 
crash of a jet bomber at a 
foreign · based US airfield 
during the 1950s. 

As in the Pentagon's 
description , the training 
ma nual repor ts that the 
aircraft cras hed du e to 
coll apsed landing gear, that 
the plane was all owed to burn 
it se lf ou t an d t h at an 
evac u at ion was or dered . 
"Erroneously," the manu al 
state, "a full nu clea r 
co n t ri b u t ion was a nt i· 
cipated ...... 

"Several days later," the 
ma nua l co ntinues, "t he 
wreckage was moni tored by an 
emergency team call ed in to 
assist at the accident and was 
found to be highly contamin-
ated wit h plu to n i u m. 
Subseq uen tl y, this contami n-
at ion was found to have spread 
not only throughout the base 
involved, but to a nava l base 
some 40 mi les away and even 
to various locat ions around the 
country." 

The naval base i question 
apparently wa a US nav al 
station at Kenrita, Morocco, 

about 40 mile ' away on the 
Atlantic coast. Pentagon 
officials, however, refuse 
either to confirm or deny 
whether this was the base 
referred to. The Pentagon's 
account of the accident, 
furthermore , make no 
mention of spreading the 
plutonium off ba e. It reports 
only that "one fi re truck and 
one fireman 's clothing howed 
s light alpha contamination." 

The DOE' t r a in i n g 
manual, however, refers to "a 
large number of vehi cles and 
aircraft. .. fou nd to be 
contami nated," as well as 
"one individual (who) received 
a significant dose - some two 
and a half times t he maximum 
permissible body burden for 
plutonium 239." 

Another detai l not included 
in the Pentagon's sum mary of 
the accident wa the los of 
safety equ ipment. Accordi ng 
to the DOE manual, .... . the 
on l y a l p h a-mo n itoring 
instrument on the base was 
backed over by a vehicle upon 
arrival at the scene, resu lting 
in a complete lose of aloha-
monitori ng capability. 

T he DOE manual also tates 
that the Air Force was 
unprepared to handle cleanup 
and decontamination of the 
site. Th is experience, it . ays, 
led to the creat ion of theJoinl 
Nu clear Accident Coordin' 
ating Center. a nuclear 
emergency unit on call for US 
radiat ion accidents world · 
wide. 

The Pentagon 's summaries 
of broken arrow include 
discussions of three nuclear 
accident - involvi ng B·47s in 
the fir t five mont h of 1958. 
Two are id e nti f i ed as 
occurring in the US and the 
third is now revealed to be the 
inciden t at Sidi Slimane. 

Moroccan em bassy officia ls 
in Washington, D.C., said they 
were unaware of any such 
accident at id i S limane. "W 
have no knowledge of that 
acc ide nt." sai d Abde ll atif 
Nacif, a spokesman for the 
embassy . 

T he US a nd Morocco 
current Iy are considering close 
mili tary cooperation. During a 
visit in February by Secretary 
of State Alexander Haig, the 
t wo cou n tries an nou nced 
steps t hat should allow the US 
to use at least two old 
American military bases in 
Morocco, poss ibly incl uding 

idi lim ane, w hich was 
phased out in the 19605.

Education cuts Achilles' heel of Reagan's budget 
By JAME RIDGEWAY 

Pacific Ne ws Ser vice 
WASHINGTON, D.C. -

Caught up in a growin!r politi· 
cal fire torm over the budget 
and economy, Pre ident Rea-
gan now has stumbled into a 
cross fire over the federal edu· 
cat ion program. 

Congressional Democ rats 
port ray Reagan not only as a 
racist enemy of the poor fo r 
cutti ng programs aimed at 
needy children but a the 
enemy of the middle class fo r 
h is ass ault on student loans. 
Con gress ional Democra t ic 
leaders believe the combina-
t ion of these is ues could fuel 
th e firs t s ignificant political 
turning point in the fortunes 
of the administration. 

But that 's onl y half the 
story. From the right wi ng, 
where the president is under 
attack a a "detenteist," his 
educat ion policie are seen as a 
dou ble cross. Reagan had 
promised to get the tederal 
governme nt out of education, 
ret urn it to local government 
and dismantle the Department 
of Education. Ins tead, he has 
only tri mmed the programs 
and spon ored a foundation 
instead of a depar tment. 

Furio u s co nservatives 
charge that Secretary of Edu-
cation TerrelI BelI has "sand· 
bagged" t he presiden t and 
brought on political disas ter. 

The debate over education 
raises many menacing ques' 
tions for both Democrats and 

moderate Repu blicans. Cuts in 
education are bei ng made duro 
ing a recession when the free 
marketplace is under strain 
and i1\ ·prepared to cushion the 
blows. For most students, the 
prospect of taking out 15 per· 
cent bank loans to pay for col-
lege or gradu ate school is 
s imply inconceivable. St u· 
dents who don't go to college 
end up on the job market, 
where they will exacerbate the 
already ri sing unemploy men t. 

Overal1, Reagan proposed to 
reduce federal educat ion pro· 
grams by 37 percent. The {ocal 
point of the debate is a handful 
of student aid programs which 
provide millions of coll ege tu-
dents with loans every year. 

Two of these programs, the 
o·cal1ed Pell grant for tho e 

who otherwise couldn 't afford 
to attend college, and the gua· 
ranteed student loans ava ila-
ble to tho e with a fami ly 
income below $30,000, are tar· 
geted by the administration 
for cuts and struct ural cha nge. 

The admi nis tration wants 
to s lash the Pell grants near ly 
in half, eli mi nat ing 900.000 
students fro m the program. At 
the same t ime, Reagan wou ld 
change the terms of the gua-
ranteed student loan program 
by requiring students to pay a 
higher origination fee. The 
rate wou ld be increased from 
five to ten percent, meaning 
that to get a $2.000 loan you'd 
have to borrow $2,200. 

T he president' program 

also would install a new repa\' -
ment schedule, requiring that 
part of the loans be repaId at 
market rates rather than the 
current s ubs idized nine 
percent. 

Finall y. the government 
wants a "tudent's family to 
pass a needs test based on 
examinatIOn of annual mcome 
tax fi lings. 

Graduate students would be 
denied all access toguaranteed 
student loans and instead 
referred to an auxiliary stu· 
dent loan program whose 
interest rates are set at 14 per-
cent. Repayment would begin 
while students still were in 
school. 

The American Council of 
Education estimates that the 
600,000 graduate stud nt " 
who now have loans would be 
forced out of school bv these 
proposed c hanges.' The} 
repre. ent about half the total 
graduate school enrollment. 

Res ibtance to these cuts In 
the House already has reli eved 
educators' worst fears for the 
current fi sca l year, but the 
long-term prospects remain in 
doubt. 

[n additiontolhehigheredu-
ca tion cuts, the admmistra-
tion is a~king for a one-third 
cut in Title I fund s for pnmarj 
and sl'Condary educat IOn. a 
decline from $2.9 billion In fis-
ca l 1981 to$1.9blllion In fiscal

under Title I generally are 
aimed at improving basic read-

At least one source within 
the administration views the 
overall budget plan as a plot by 

ecretary Bell. '' If you ask 
yourself what group of idiots 
drew this up ," he said, "you 
have to say that what they 
were trying to do was to 
embarrass the president. I 
think the real story at the 
Department of Education is 
that Bell is doing everything 
he can to embarra s the presi -
dent and keep the Department 
of Education. Ile'soneofthem; 
he's part of the education 
establishment. The educat ion 
foundation is just the Depart-
ment of Education by another 
name." 

Conservat ives wi thin I he 
depart ment see themselves 
caught in t he cross fire and 
spend their time refuting 
attacks from the right. They 
picture Bell as a "realist," hiS 
program as "an incremental 
step" toward dismantling the 
fedcral educational machtn 
crv. And the secretary is 
referred to with just the trace 
of a 'i mile as a man revealing 
"grace under pressure."

Third RA situation continues to develop 

Th ird College Dean chooses to reopen process 
By DOUG SM IT H 

sInn \\- riler 
Third College Dean Beverly 

Varga has decided to rc'Open 
the application period for 
selecting next year' s Third 
College RAs. Varga said that 
the pool of applicants was not 
sufficiently "diverse" or indic-
ative of Third College's minor-
ity population. Therefore, she 
feels that only by reopening 
the application period will the 
election committee be given a 

suitable pool from which to 
choose students to fill next 
year's 12 RA positions . 

Many of Third College'sstu-
dents and student organiza-
tions were displcased by 
Varga 's actions. Students 
representing BSU , AA A, 
~IEChA, the A '. and \'arious 
Third College groups delivered 

sugge~t ions to Dean \' arga 
that they felt might c:lle\ late 
many of the problems inherent 
in this year 's RA selection 
proce'iS_ 

tud nts serving on the RA 

selection committee were told 
by Third College Resident 
Dean Yolanda Trevino-Robles 
that race was not to be a factor 
in evaluattng applica nt s. 
These st udent s now feel that 
they ::.hou ld ha\'e been advised 
to take the "multi-cultural 
em'ironment of Third College" 
Into aceou nt in interviewing 
candidates. This, they believe, 
would have made the-selection 
committee more sensitive to 
the over-all balance thev were 
attempting to achieve. -

Looking beyond the actual 
evaluating criteria of the RA 
selection committee, spokes-
people for both the BSl and 
7\1EChA felt that the\,werenot 
gi \ en en()ught time -to inform 
their organlzatiom ' members 
of the aVailable RA posltion~ . 
The" feel that 10 thefuturethe 
Dean 's office should pn)\'ide 
two w('Cks nmice before open-
ing and dosing the application 
period_ They believe this \\ ill 
pre\, ent anot her low turnout of 
mlnonty students as \\as 

experienced thi.., year. 
The CPA requirement for 

being a Third College RA IS 
al"o an issu(' that students ft.'el 
needs to be evaluated_ At 
Third College. good academte 
standing when applying for an 
RA position is set at 2.5. At 
UCSD\ three other college". 
the minimum CPA le\el for 
sen ing as an RA is 2.0. Some 
stud nts tend to think that by 
lowenng Third's CPA require-
ment from 2.5 to 2.0, more st u-
dents would be qualified for 
RA posillons. 

Varga, howe\ er, does not 
agree. he states that the one 
year in which Third College 
expenmented \\'I t h I he ~.()

The shortage of money fac-
Ing t he AS l!i not a~ 'ierious a~ 
was once predicted. and it is 
not as seriOUS as the statistICS 
wou Id i nd itat e. 

The money in Question is 
the "general unallocated" 
fund , \\ hich has roughl y 
$1.000 remaining in it. The 
fact ual statement that "t he A~

sound unsettling. However, 
t he nat ure of the general, unal-

of t he money in it is distrib-
uted at the beginning of the 
year, when student organiza-

SACRAME TO - While 
most Uni\'er ity of California 
'tudents were taking final 
exams or beginningtheirshort 
spring break, Gov. Brown. on 
March 19. informed the liC 
Board of Regents in Lo~ 
Angeles that the university 
may face the largest budget 
reduction in Its history next 
year. 
, In admitting for the first 
time publicly his proposed

that the institution's

But as the state".., econom\'

Brown 's warnIng to the 
Regent s. 

How would cut" of Brown\ 
magnitude affect the 
Uniyersnv of California? And 
what would it mean to 
students? 

L C lobbyi~t Lowell Paige 
intimated Thursday a 10 
percent cut from the state 
would no doubt result in 
another fee increase. and could 
possibly lead totheimposllion

Uni\'erslty's budget, which 
voted March 15 to keep fees at 
the current level. 

But that unanimous \'ote 
came before Bro\\ n's speech to 
the Regents. and sulxommit·

their votes pertaining to the 
l niversity are subject to 
change. 

In fact . Paige and l C budget

has not asked t hem to revise 
the spending plan or create a 
new one. 

"There has l>een no formal 
proposal by the administration 
to come up with any more 
reductions." the official said. 
"As soon as we complete the 
Mav re\'enue revision we will 
e~trmate whether that kind of 
(budget ) reVIsion is needed." 

Since legIslators have 
agreed to adopt a wait-and-see

Meanwhile. here is a 
wrapup of UC-related action 
taken and issues di;;clIssed in 
Sacramento during t he pa~t 
t\\O weeks. when most 
st uden ts \\'ere enjoying sprt ng 
break or taking final exams: 

- The Assemblv Ways and 
Means educallon subcommit-
tee _Warch 16 approved more 
than $3 million for the 
Uni\'ersitv to offset a fiscal 
short fall caused by o\erenrol· 
I men t. The l n i \. e r sit \ 
underestimated the number (if 
student~ enrolled this year and 
next \·ear. 

Again , Ihis allocalion is in 
jeopardy based on budget 
predictions. In addition. the 
Uni\ersity needs another 0.8 
mIllion io full\' co\er the 
overenrollment; -

- On March 16, three UC 
lect lireI''' told the same 
subcummlttee non -tenurable 
faculty, primarily hired to 
teach lower di\ Ision and 
remedial basic su bjects, are 

relegat ed to an "underclass." 
and are considered "second 
class" cit 17en~. 

"Lecturer" are the cheapest 
~ource of teachers a\ atJable," 
saId LIC Santa Barbara 
lecturer Mark Fererr. one of 
1.500 in the l lC svstem. "The 
Icct urer's position does not 
ha\'e the same clout and the 
same protection in the system 
(afforded full-time faculty)." 

A", a result. lecturers are in 
constant fear of being fired. 
and do not receive enough 

fund~ needed to teach their 
course..,. he said; 

- Th" A~sembl\' lVlarch 17

By comparison, t he goals set 
by the two runners in Personal

Veteran screenwriter Robert 
Towne (Shampoo, Ch illalowH,

At the heart of the movie is a 
romantic/athletic triangle of 
two runners, young Chris 
Cahill and experienced Tory

script of Persol1al Best is at its 
best when examining the jeal·

unusual relationship - the 
jealousy and frustration expe· 
rienced by two women who are 
friends and lovers but also

Abbey \ViII deliver lecture 
Famed author will speak at Belkin series at UCSD 

Edward .A.bbey, famed as the 
author of Deserl Sulitaire and 
of The Monkey Wrench Gail!!, 
will give the fourt h annual Bel-
kin Memorial Lecture Thurs-
day, April 22, at l CSD, 
Abbey's talk is to be titled , "A 
Walk Through the Desert 
Hills. " 

The Belkin Lecture senes 
was established by t he parents 
and friends of David Marc Bel · 
kIn, an honor graduate of John 
~uir College at UC D. Belk!l1 
lost his life in a tragic accident 
while backpacking in t he High 

ierra in 197 . 
Abbey is well·known for his 

hard·hitting, omet imes bit· 
t r, usually irreverent defense 
of the world's wilderness 
areas. he is a prolific full·time 
writer as well as a sometime 
park ranger, fire lookout and 
profe sor. Abb ey, who 
recently turned 55, has pub-
lished over a dozen books in 
the la, t quarter-century . 

Abbey's best·known non· 
fiction work is Desert ulilaire, 
publi 'hed in 1968. The book 
wa, framed mostly out of jour· 
nals he kept while working as 
a ranger at the Arches 
National Monument in sou· 
theastern Utah. Desert Soli· 
taire describe Abbey 's 
encounter with the desert's 
natural features, from snake 
to heat. and with its human 
viS Itors, from tourist · to pros-
pectors. The book makes clear 
Abbey', great respect and 
affect ion for the desert. a" well 

as his st renuous dIsapproval 
of most visitors to it. Abbey 's 
other non-fiction work 
includes The journey Home. 
Abbey's Road and Dowll (he 
Riller. 

Abbey's best-known nO\'el is 
The Monkev Wrench Ga II!!. 
published in 1975. The "gang" 
in quest ion is a memorable if 

Ledurer Edward Abbey 

improbable band of eco· 
guerilla , led by George W. 
Ha yd uke . The monke y 
wrenchers roam the American 

outhwest, disabling bulldoz· 
ers, power lines, bridges and 
other manifestations of the 
progress and the exploitat ion 
which they de pise. In the end, 
the gang i caught and impri· 
soned. Hayduke escapes how· 
ever and, as the novel closes, a 
econd generation of monkey 

wrenchers has it destruct ive

Dam. Abbey's other novels 
include The Br{//'e Cowboy. 
Fire Oil Ihe !IlUIt IIlaill , and 
Goud Nell'S. 

Abbey's writing powerfully 
articulates an exception'a l 
range of personal responses to 
open land (especially desert) 
and to the human force~ (e::-.pe· 
ciall y intrusive) which shape 
that land. uch land mostlv 
inspires in Abbey ebullience. 
love and awe. uch human for· 
ces mostly lIlSpire in him 
anger, bitterness and despair. 
Ted Morgan has 'haracterized 
Abbey ali "a Ji\ ing American 
artifact. part maverick, part 
pastoral extremist. part semi-
herm it, part lat ter·day Jere· 
miah Johnson." 

Morgan" s tring of phrases 
certain ly captures the most 
prominent st rand in Edward 
Abbey's work. Yet the full 
story is a bit more complex. 
For one thing, Abbey occasion· 
ally avers that the reckless, 
romantic, irasci ble individual-
ist who appears to write his 
books is but a persona, that 
their actual author is a mild-
mannered reporter without 
much wildness to offer. 

The Belklll Lecture series , 
which began in 1979, each 
spring brings to the UC D 
campus a speaker di tin · 
guished for his or her work in 
wilderness conservation and 
environmental s tudies. 

The lecture, which is free 
and open to the public, will 
begin at 8:00 pm in USB 2722.

'F.O.B.' at 
Marquis 

By DON EO 
The trials and tribulations of Steve, a 

Chinese immil,'Tant, are parodied in 
Fresh Offlhe Baal, which is current ly at 
the Marquis Public Th ater. The play 
contains three separate plots that are 
portrayed well by G ingerlily Lowe, 
David Tamayo. and Ed You. 

Fresh Off lite Baal was written by 
David Hwang and it I ecently won the 
OBEY award for best off-Broadway 
play of the year. As the story unfolds, 
the audience sees why it received the 
award. 

The three stories of the play are the 
historical, t he metaphysical, and the 
present. The hist orical port ion of the 
play was revealed through Steve 
(David Tamavo). The wrath the Chi-

The LlCSO Guardian 

n(''-,l' immigrants 1Jlcurrl'd on the \\est 
coast was handled fla\\ le"sly by 
Tamayo, ancl drew s" mpat h~ from the 
audience. 

The metaphysical facet of the play 
wa~ projected by Grace ((;mgerldy 
Lowe) and Tamayo. The myt hology of 
Gwang Gung and Fa Mu Lan reveals 
the actors ' dexterity in Kung Fu , while 
exposing the richness of Chinese 
mythology. . 

The present, the mo~t acceSSIble 
level of the play, was presented humor· 
ously by Ed You . Ed portrays Dale. the 
American born and bred character who 
severs any ties with the old world. 
Dale's prejudice and contemptuous 
attitude towards ' teve produced the 
biggest laughs of the play. Dale's nar-
row perspect ive of his ancestry is also 
hilariou'l . ~ .

that whi le maintaining a \'ery 
individualistic approach to his 
mUSIC, Byrne has allowed him· 
self to absorb some of t he more 
accessible qualitie~ of Eno's 
work. However, this results in 

records Those who have followed the Talking Heads since the 
early days when " Psycho 
Killer became an underground 
hit will find Byrne's latest 
album to be typically surpris· 
ing. Eno. who worked with 
Byrne on a few of the album's 
selections, has obviously left 
his mark on the Talking 
Head's leader. 

"Eggs in a Briar Patch" and 
"My Big Hands (Fall through 
the Cracks)" are indications 

something that at this time 
Byrne i not fully comfortable 
with. Though The Catherine 
Wheel includes a few success-
ful experiments, it appears 
that Byrne feels 'afer in the 
familiar terrain he established 
for himself in working with

Although not a single 

intramural game has been 
played, much has happened at 
the 1M department thi week. 
Fi r t of all, as expected, both 
softball and volleyball had a 
record turnout. 262 team. are 
<;igned up for softbal l , 
compared to last year'. 236. 
Unfortunately, the depart· 
ment only has en ugh money to 
support 250, '0 12 squads will 
be di appointed. 

fly up to 'anta Cruz to 
compete against against the 
other UCs. [f you wonder how 
the 1M department can afford 
to fly teams to anta Cruz to 
compete and not afford to 
support all the teams that 
want to play here . there is a 
simple answer. The AlI ·Cal is 
budgeted form Berkeley, and 
the funds to f1v the teams to 
Santa Cruz come out of that 
budget. UC D's 1M depart· 
ment does not contribute any 
monev to the All·Cal. 

Fin'ally at the captains' 
meet ings all teams voted not to 
have any games this weekend, 
Easter weekend , The games 
missed will most likely be 
made up toward the end of the 
quarter on a weekday.

They are better, believe it! 
By TIM PICKWELL 

... The 'an Diego Padres lost 
their home opener to the 
Atlanta Braves, 1·0, Tuesday 
night. [ know you're thinking 
"same old Padres," But that's 
not true. 

They are different. Honest. r 
swear it. They are a better 
team this year t han in any pre· 
vious year. 

I received this r.:-velation 
after watch ing Terry Kennedy 
~trike out with a man on ba~e. 

"So much for this rall\'," I 
thought to myself. "'terry 
Kennedy was a heav).- hiller. 
The next guy in the lineup will 
be a banjo player. Someone like 
Enzo Hernandez or Da\'e 
Campbell." 

But then Lui s Salazar 
s tepped UP to the plate. Hey 

t his guy hit over .:mo last year! 
And now hc's batti ng seventh. 
Wow! The Padres must be 
good, they have depth. 

ever mind t he fact that 
they were shut out, the Padres 
have act ual, real live baseball 
players - hitters - in the 
lineup. Broderick Perkins, 
who led the league with a .340 
average for part of las t year, 
hats eighth. This is a different 
team.

Now, wi th II overall wins,

believes part of the reason for

Of course, though It sags a

The field seems to beckon 
ballplayers. Few are able to 
resist its call.

"After a weekend, it's obvious

Pacific News Service 

Black America's view of the nuclear arms race 
By PAMELA DOUGLAS 

Pacilic News Sen ice 
LO ANGELE , CALIF. -

"Triumph," intoned the 
preacher to the black congre-
gation in central Los Angeles, 
"i not what we think. How 
fooli h, how grievous ly fooli h 
it is, to think a triumph is 
bombing another nation into 
s ubmi ion, i having the 
power to kill...Triumph! Tri -
umph! The only real triumph 
i life!" 

This i surpris ing stuff for 
a black commumty chur h. 
Until recently, is ue of war 
and peace and nuclear wea-
pons took adistant back seat to 
the more pres ing concerns of 
this and other poor, black con-
gregations, s uch as losing the 
welfare payments. 

But, says the Rev, Thomas 
Kilgore ot Second Bapti t 
Church, "unless we can abate 
the threal of nuclear war, we 
can forget about everything 
ebe, 'cause won't be nobody 
here." 

The anti·nuclear weapons 
sermon at econd Bapti. t s till 
is atypical of polil ical priori-

tie~ in t he black community, 
but it is a certain sign that the 
nationwide campaign for a 
nuclear freeze is touChlOg all 
sectors of society. Black 
church leaders, especially, are 
r ~p()ndlOg to the theme - a 
sign that the congregations are 
willing to hsten. 

Dr. Lucius Walker. execu· 
tive director of th ew York· 
based In ter·Rellgious Founda-

lion, interprets the emergence 
of the issue in black communi-
ties in terms that are partly 
economic, partly ethnic. 

"The black community sees 
money being taken from the 
needs of des per at Iy poor peo-
ple in order to create weapons 
to destroy communities of 
other p,oor people around the 
world, 'he ay, "Short of an 
all·out war, the only places any 
'limited' war would be waged 
is in countries of color. I'm 
hearing a growing sen e of 
that among people r work 
with, who are mostly com-
munity organizers and black 
ministers. " 

Dr. Walker and other black 
mini ter ,however, would like 
10 orient the nuclear freeze 
movement toward a more gen-
eral consensus for human 
needs. ays the Rev. igel 
Riley , a s taff member of the 
Board of Global Minis trie of 
Ihe United Methodi ,t Church: 
"The liberal wing of mo t 
mainstream denominations is 
focus ing on peace, which takes 
in nucl ear di sa rmament. 
We' re trying to u e that to 
build a coalition among liberal 
forces. I do think the church 
needs to chall enging social 
and economic ystem more. I 
belie\'e they need to focus on 
challengi ng a sy. tern that 
wou ld cut a poor family's 
sustenance. " 

ome black SOCial activists 
express little expectat ion that 
the gap between the basically 
white, middle-class anti-

BASS 

nuclear movem nt and the 
concerns of poor blacks can be 
breached . 

"I don't run into anyone 
who' s ta lkin g about the 
nuclear thing," said Dorothy 
Tillman, a longtime Chicago 
civil rights activist who i cur· 
rently ca mpaigning for better 
public chool. "We have an 
education crisis, a housing cri· 
sis, an unemployment crisis, 
so we don't talk about a 
nuclear cris is. We have a war 
of our own. We have a holo-
caust right here," 

Tillman aid he recently 
tried talking about the e press· 
ing problems to a group of peo· 
pie on a nationwide peace walk 
and got only glas y-eyed 
responses. Tillman said she 
isn' t trying to downplay the 
erious ne s of nuclear war but 

emphasized that the problems 
of the black community are far 
more immediate. "The gra' . 
roots people s imply aren't talk· 
ing about nuclear war. The 
com munity people are trying 
to su rvi \' e. Our war is wi thin 
ou r cit ies." 

Some go even further in dis· 
tancing themselve from the 
nucl ear freeze mov eme nt. 
"There 'eems to be a rac is m 
in\'olved with classical peace 
groups," said Mustaffa Ran-
dolph, \' ice pre ident of the 
New York· based Black Vete· 
rans for Social Ju stice. "They 
don't want to recogni7 issues 
of A merican racism or US 
intent ion in Third World coun-
tries . They want tolimitthem-

selves to an environmental 
interpretation. 

"The average black person, " 
,he continue, "i n't thinking 
about a nuclear bomb. He's 
thinking about a cheese sand-
wich," Middle·class whites, he 
adds , "don't have to relale to 
whal blacks think about - the 
hunger, having no jobs, or no 
place to Iive .... That ' why 
we're having problems unify-
ing wit h them." 

Randy Kehler, director of 
Ihe National Clearing House of 
the Nuclear Weapons Freeze 
Campaign, acknowledges that 
few blacks have gotten deeply 
involved in the issue, "The 
freeze campaign has not made 
a serious effort in minority 
communities to connect it to 
is ues that are higher on poor 
people 's agendas," he says. 
"We'd like to become a more 
multiracial organization, but. 
we're nol now." 

Interviews conducted wit h 
ordinary people in black com-
munitie bear out the sense of 
ambivalence many feel toward 
the movement. 

''I'm not really that invoh'ed 
with the nuclear thing," said 
Gladys mith , a part·time 
securit y guard and baby sitter 
in Harlem. " I really don' t have 
time for it, between working, 

taking care of my kids, trying 
to better my self, som e. But I 
upport it. r really do." 
Said Lid ya Carter, a reI ired 

ho pital worker in her late60s: 
''I'm more worried aboul gel· 
ting mugged or shot on the 
streel than r am about nuclear 
weapon , Just the ot her. day, a 
friend of mine was. tuck up in 
t he elevator of the hui lding we 
live in, in broad daylight. 
Frankly, the e are the kinds of 
problems ['m really concerned 
about. The bom b seem a long 
way off from here," 

Despite thi s gra s roots 
alientation from the nuclear 
issue, more black leader ' , from 
mini s ters to politician s, 
believe black participation in 
the movement i not only 
desirabl , but imperative. 

" If we don 'I inject ourselves, 
these deva lations which cut 
I he hu man need budget while 
s p nding on the military will 
continue to be ignored," says a 
s pokesman for Congressman 
Ron Dell urn s, O·Calif. " Blacks 
arc just beginning to awaken 
to their power in influencing 
foreign policy, military and 
economic deci ' ions, and \\c 
know now that we have no 
choice bu t to change t his 
government's priorities."

unfor eeable "em rgencies"

The overriding reason to ~ee 
Pcrsonal Besl, though , is 
indeed to see it. Its Visual st\1

As a last resort. there is a 
Mandate Reserve fund of 
$25.000 that could be dra\\ n

designed to be added to year by

large sum of money that the 
A can utilize for a major
