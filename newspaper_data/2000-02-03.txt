Grozny and would soon capture

the Russian advance on Grozny 
had accelerated.

A.S. Cuts Media Funding 
COUNCIL: Reductions are a result of increasing media groups 
By MATT SCHRADER 
Staff Writer 

. The A.S. is allocating less 
money to each media organiza-
tion this year due to an increase 
in the number of such organiza-
tions on campus, combined 
with a decrease in their popu-
larity. 

"The problem is that there 
are more publications and other 
media this year," said Bobby 
Kim, commissioner of commu-
nications. "Funding has to be 
spread out thinner." 

Kim said that many media 
groups that were given more 

money in the past have had 
their funding cut due to an 
increase in the · number of 
media organizations. 

"They are not getting nearly 
enough," he said. " I am essen-
tially giving most of the media 
about half [the amount) they 
are asking for, even though J 
would love to give them more." 

The Koala, one of UCSD's 
alternative newspapers, is one 
media organization that has 
suffered due to the decrease in . 
allocated money. 

"As of last year we were 
getting $1,800 a quarter," Koala 
member Tulley Rafferty said. 

"Now we are getting around 
$1,350, which is obviously not 
enough to do our normal run." 

The Koala, which has pub-
lished two 12-page papers per 
quarter in past years, no longer 
has the necessary funds to com-
plete their goal. The Koala 
makes 8,000 copies of each 
issue for distribution, which 
costs approximately $850 per 
issue. The excess money is 
s~nt on necessary office sup-
plies. 

As a result of the decrease in 
its budget, the Koala was only

Students 
Chosen by 
NASA 
PROGRAM: Students 
will conduct experiinents 
in a low-gravity airplane 
By MALAVI KA GANGOLLY 
Staff Writer 

Bioengineering students 
Gerhardt Konig, Bhavin Patel, 
Jason athanson and Gaurav 
Abbi were chosen to participate 
in a NASA program where they 
will design and test a reduced-
gravity experiment. 

The team, along with faculty 
mentors John Frangos of the bio-
engineering department and 
Michael Wiskerchen, director of 
Cal Space, designed an experi-
ment that involves modeling 
fluid hifts that occur when the 
body enters a reduced flight grav-
ity environment. 

David Gough, chair of the 
department of bioengineering, 
said that the students' experiment 
is quite significant. 

'If vafidated, such a model 
may prove beneficial for the 
development of effective counter 
measures for this fluid shift, 
which likely mediates thE! bone 
loss and cardiovascular problems 
associated with space flight," he 
said. 

Each year, NASA holds its KC-
135 Student Flight Program. The 
program provides a unique acad-
emic experience for undergra.du-
ate students to propose, deSIgn, 
build and test a reduced-gravity 
experiment. 

The teams, which are com-
prised of four students, formulate 
a proposal that complies with 
Standard NASA Lyndon B.

OBnUARY: Communication expert researched mass media and issues pertaining to the 'Information Age' 
By REBECCA WOOD 
Staff Writer 

Herbert Schiller, professor 
emeritus of the UCSD communi-
cation department, died Jan. 29 
in La Jolla after a long illness. He 
was 80 years old. 

Schiller was known for his 
research in the study of commu-
nication and public debate on 
the role of the media in modem 
society. 

Schiller began his career as an 
economist and then directed his 
studies to the media in the 1960s. 

He argued that because the 
mass media is closely tied to the 
centers of political and economic 
power, it often falls short of its 
most crucial role of providing a 
democratic forum and actin~ as a 

watchdog of powerful interests. 
Schiller also foresaw trends in 

the communication field . 
Carol Padden, chair of the 

communication department, 
said that in the 1970s Schiller rec-
ognized the issues pertaining to 
the "Information Age," such as 
how the interest of ownership 
interferes with the spread of 
ideas. 

Schiller came to UCSD in 1970 
and was the first professor in the 
communication program. He 
established communication as a 
regular depvtment of the uni-
versity by 1982 and developed a 
Ph.D. program in communica-
tion in 1984. 

"When I arrived here in 1978, 
Herb was the heart, soul and ral-
lying point for students interest-

ed in critical studies of the 
media," Michael Cole, professor 
of communication, stated in a 
press release. "The conversion of 
communication from a small 
program to a large, world class 
department is in no small mea-
sure a monument to Herb's ener-
gy and determination." 

Cole said Schiller was known 
as a controversial figure to mal)Y 
and said he will be most remem-
bered for "his radical views, 
compellin~ speaking style and 
sharp wit. ' 
. Padden said that Schiller was 
a popular professor whose class-
rooms were often packed. 

Schiller is also the author of 
eight books and hundreds of 
articles in scholarly and popular 
journals. In his work, he wamed 

of the private takeover of public 
space and public institutions, 
and U.S. corporate domination 
of cultural life, especially in 
developing nations. 

Schiller's work started what 
is known as the critical political 
economy school of communica-
tion research. 

"He insisted on the impor-
tance of political and economic 
factors," Cole said. 

Padden said that in his 1973 
book, The Mind Managers, 
Schiller exposed the hidden eco-
nomic objectives that could 
potentially interfere with how 
the media communicates with 
the public. 

Schiller's work was also influ-

UC to Recognize Veterans Day 
The University of California will honor the service 

and sacrifice of the nation 's war veterans by desig-
nating Veterans Day, Nov. 11, one of its offICial holi-
days beginning this year, UC President Richard 
Atkinson announced WednesQay. 

In years where Nov. 11 falls on a Saturday, the pre-
ceding Friday will be the date of observation. If the 
date falls on a Sunday, the holiday will be observed on 
the following Monday. This practice corresponds with 
the dates set for observing Veterans Day in 
California's public schools. . 

University holidays currently include New Year's 
Day, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, President's Day, 
Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, 
Thanksgiving as well as winter and spring administra-

" BioTerrorism: The Medical and Public Health 
Response" is a western regional conference for med-
ical care P.l'oviders, emergency medical services, pub-
lic officials and community members to be held Feb. 
3 through Feb. 5 in San Diego. 

The conference will focus on preparations under-
way and those still needed in the Western United 
States, Western Canada and Northern Mexico. 
Representatives from local, state and national agen-
cies will come together to discuss plans to deal with 
an attack. This conference will help facilitate coordi-
nation and cooperation between agencies and organi· 
zations that have very different missions and philoso-
phies, according to conference sponsors. 

In the event of mass casualties, local and state 
medical care faCilities will potentially be ove~­
whelmed. Conference sessions will include the 
nature of the bioterrorism threat, and will address 
international, federal, state and local agencies ' 
preparations. . 

Panelists will discuss how a large metropolitan 
city with an international border, major military insta~ 
lations and a large population of tourists should pre-
pare for detection of a threat, examine options and 
make decisions during time of crisis, mobilize effec-
tive responses and undertake containment mea-
sures. 

The conference will feature experts on three top-

demiology and appropriate responses to the mOst like-
ly agents; understanding institutional and appropriate 
response roles, identifying resources and limitations; 
and public education on bioterrorism facts and myths. 

A panel discussion on a scenario of the release of 
a smallpox virus will cover medical community needs; 
public health monitoring and surveillance; treatment 
and containment concerns; pharmaceutical, vaccine 
and equipment needs; quarantine, decontamination 
and ongoing medical care. 

Another panel discussion called "Operational 
Considerations: Responding to the Threat" will cover 

Inter~rganizational coordination efforts as well as 
preparations for strengthening a response plan in the 
event of a bioterrorism attack. 

The final panel session will discuss informing the 
media and the p.ublic about protection, accessible 
resources, bioterrorism preparedness and how 
response Objectives can be met.

MEDIA: 
Kim said most 
media is unpopular

able to finance one 12-page issue 
and one B-page issue, printing 
5,000 copies of each. 

" Issues normally don't last 
more than a couple of days, part-
ly because of demand and partly 
because various 
administrators/janitors inexplic-
ably decide to throwaway large 
stacks of them," Rafferty said. 
"So it sucks to cut our copy that 
much." 

Rafferty said Koala staff mem-
bers have had to resort to other 
revenue resources. 

"We have had to put money 
out of our own [pockets] to meet 
the difference," he said. ":J'his 
would be fine if we had adver-
tisements, but that is a full-time 
job and it is hard to get someone 
to do that for us, even with the 
incentives we can offer.:' 

Despite a desire to allocate 
more money to media organiza-
tions, Kim said that the A.S. 
Council feels it is justified in cutr 
ting funding-due to the decreas-
ing popularity of media groups 
on campus. 

"There is a lack of money for

dead, on our campus," Kim said. 
"Students may Simply be more 
into things like the Internet now 
or other forms of media besides 
prinl publications." 

Kim also said the quality of 
many media organizations may 
contribute to their lack of popu-
larity on campus. 

"Current media publications 
are, on the majority, very poorly 
made and hardly produced even 
once a quarter," he said. 

Regardless, Koala staff mem-
bers argue the validity of this 
claim as they feel they are very 
popular among students. 

"The Koala has been around 
longer than most incoming fresh-
man have been alive," Rafferty 
said. "We have consistently been 
one of the most - if not the most 
- popular forms of alternative 
media around." 

The money allotted to these 
alternative media groups most 
likely will not increase in the 
future. Kim said he foresees less 
aLLocation in the future as the per-
ceived popularity continues to 
decrease. 

" In my opinion, funding for 
media will go nowhere but down 
from here," he said. "A lot of 
paper is being wasted and a lot of 
potentially great publications 
[are] simply thrown away 
because no one's reading any of 
it, if they can find it anywhere on 
campus to begin with." 

Since the passage of Proposition 
209, other state governments have 
battled over the use of racial pref-
erences. Texas, Florida, Michigan 
and Washington have recently 
passed or are attempting to pass 

l~lation that would end the use 
of affirmative action in admissions 
decisions for their public universi-
ty systems.

Students Often Neglect Their 
Participation in Elections 

This Monday, February 7, is the last day to register 
to vote in California for the March 7, 2000 primary 
election. If the students at UCSO continue to show the 
same political apathy they have displayed in the past, 
the pro peets for our future will be grim. Nationwide, 
statistics show that the college-age population is not 
only far less likely to regi ter' to vote than those 25 and 
older, but we are far less likely to show up and actual-
ly cast a vote on election day even if we are registered. 

The univer ity population, where the average tu-
dent is more educated than tho e of the general public 
and should have a better understanding of politics, has 
ab olutely no justification for its dismally low voter 
turnout. Older voter consi tently have a much higher 
turnout than college tudents. Do UCSD tudents real-
ly want our age group to be marginalized and remain 
unheard in the political arena for simply failing to vote? 

Students at UCSO have little excuse for not regis-
tering. There are several locations on campus with 
voter regi tration form : in the Price Center (until 
Friday), at the Registrar 'S office, at the Food Co-op in 
the Student Center, at the LGBT Resource Center 
Office and at the Women's Center (behind the 
Registrar's office). There are also roaming volunteers 
acro campus who will happily give students a form. 

For U SO students who are regi tered to vote in 
other countie , it is not too late to apply as an absentee' 
VOler. To do this you will need to get in contact with 
your county elections official, information which is 
readily available on the California government home 
page at http://www.ca.gov. Even if you're not intere t-
ed in San Diego politics or candidates, there are impor-
tant statewide initiatives and po itions that will effect 
all Californians and residents of other states that you 

hOl,lld vote on. 
ollege student traditionally volunteer more than 

any other segment of the population. This is an 
admirable quality that we should all be proud of, but 
ommunity involvement comes in more form than 

hand -on experience. As the next generation of leaders, 
college students have a duty to help hape the future of 
our city, our tate and our country through voting. 

The Guardian urges all UC D students to take a 
stand and register to vote for thi year's primary. Even 
if you can't relate to any of the candidates, you should 
till vote on the controver ial propo itions on this 

year 's ballot. 
One vote doesn 't make a difference. It's true. But 

thousands of people refusing to vote because of this 
logic does make a difference. The college population as 
a whole needs to mobilize if it wants to make a differ-
ence. Register to vote, convince your roommates and 
your classmates to register. Then make sure that you 
show up to the polls March 7.

Presidential Front-runners 
Claw Their Way to the Top 

COMMENTARY: Bu~h and Gore rely on dirty tactics to secure their victories 
By DAVID YEN 
Staff Writer 

The easiest way to stay on top in 
a preSidential election is to start out 
on top. Such is the case with 
Republican and Democratic front-
runners, Gov. George W. Bush and 
Vice President Al Gore, who 
emerged victorious from the 
nation's first caucuses in Iowa. 
Beginning the race as prohibitive 
"overdogs" enabled Bush and Gore 
to overcome serious blunders along 
the campaign trail as well as to re-
establish themselves as "the ones to 
beat," often at the expense of other 
less fortunate candidates. 

Bush, for example, was practical-
ly anoi!'ted president by his party 
before he even announced his can-
didacY. The Republican Party was 
so desperate to regain the White 
House that it was willing to jump 
on the bandwagon of anyone with a 
decent chance to win. Who better 
than the former president's son, a 
clear anti-Clintonite who nonethe-
less has a dash of that Clinton-esque 
charisma? The media showered him 
with publicity; after all, he was the 
navor of the month and a serious 
alternative to the "inevitability" of 
AI Gore. 

l! would not be until a fcw 
months later that the tide turned and 
people started to believe that Bush 
possessed an arrogant disdain for 
everyone other than himself. 

The kickoff to Gore's campaign, 
in contrast, was more low-key and 
plagued with turmoil. Considering 
Clinton's record-~igh popularity 
and the booming economy, Gore's 
bid for the nomination seemed like 
a no-brainer. The media was well 
aware of his reputation for being 
"wooden" and his lack of Clinton-
style charm. Still, they figured these 
liabilities would emerge in a presi-
dential election, not a Democratic 
primary. Gore, unpredictable and 
unpolished, managed to prove 
them wrong: He took the nomina-
tion for granted, opting to focus on 
Bush instead of looking over his 

Bush and Gore)s tactics 
are quite intriguing -
uSt/,ally, it is the underdogs 
and not the front-runners 
who concentrate on 
negatives in an election. 
But this is by all means a 
different kind of election, 
dominated by character 
rather than issues. With

from post-Lewinsky

shoulder. 

So, on came the challengers. On 
the Republican side, enter Arizona 
Sen. John McCain, Vietnam war hero 
and obliterator of special interests. 

As a "straight shooter" with an inter-
esting biography and a history as an 
independent thinker, he is the oppo-
site of Bush. Whereas Bush spent 
much of his adulthood jumping from 
career to career and feeding off his 
father's fame, McCain was confined 
to a Vietnam prisoner of war camp 
where he was almost tortured to 
death. He was an obvious choice for 
the media to embrace in their efforts 
to make a contest out of the 
Republican nomination. 

Former New Jersey Sen. Bill 
Bradley rose into the spotlight by 
virtue of his positive, idealistic mes-
sage and high-minded campaign. 
For many, he represented a depar-
ture from "politics as usual" - the 
term often attributed to Clinton and 
Gore, who rely more on pollsters 
than their personal convictions. Like 
McCain, Bradley also led an interest-
ing life: He was a Hall of Fame NBA 
basketball player who won two 
championships with the New York 
Knicks, then went on to a productive 
18-year senatorial career. BradJey's 
initial success was also due to polls 
that showed Gore running 15 to 20. 
points behind Bush. 

While McCain and Bradley gar-
nered national attention, Bush and 
Core did little to endear themselves 
to voters. Bush was all rhetoric and 
no substance (or as McCain would 
put it, "aU hat and no cattle"). He 
talked about being a "compassionate 
~onse~vative" - a fanc~ way of call-
mg hImself a Republican with a 
heart. 
! In debates, he resorted to scripted 
responses, using little other than his 
standard campaign rhetoric. On the 
campaign trail, he rarely fielded 
questions from the public. Instead, 
there was a smile here, a pat on the 
back there and a thousand hand-
shakes he could later brag about. 

Gore, however, had the opposite 
problem. He had lists and lists of 
ideas, but didn't seem to be connect-
ing with actual people. He hired a 
feminist consultant, Naomi Wolf,

COMMENTARY: Insights into local politics brings disillusionment COMMENTARY: Free speech cannot be abused 
By PARISA BAHARIAN 
Staff Writer 

Please restrain mE: if I'm ever 
tempted to get involved in poli-
tics again! Have me committed 
to a mental hospital if you have 
to, just don't let me ever intern 
or get a political job that would 
throw me back in with the 
sharks! 

I am so sick and tired of the 
mi nd-and-sou I-consu m ing 
game of politics where any-
thing and everything is consid-
ered fair game, where there are 
no boundaries of right and 
wrong - just the all too famil-
iar world of gray. That' why I 
had to quit, for I am still too 
idealistic, I can't just throw off 
my conscience as I would my 
coat. 

For three long months I 
interned for-a San Diego may-
oral campaign, where my morals 
were constantly compromised. 
Everyda)' I would come back to 
my dOrm" room feeling dirty, my 
conscience buried deeper under 
the pile of stinking politicat 
garbage-' dealt with daily. 

My role in the campaign was 
a "researcher," but for all practi-
cal purposes I was an investiga-
tor. My job was to build files

whose job was to remake his 
image, to turn Al Gore into an 
"alpha male." In tead, Gore 
turned into a candidate without a 
reat message, a once inevitable 
nominee forced to completely 
reinvent his campaign and 
declare himself the underdog. 
Much to the media's delight, the 
favorites now had a real race on 
their hands. 

Bush and Gore reclaimed 
their advantages with a simple 
tactic - they attacked. The 
surest way to overcome negative 
assessments of a campaign is to 
create a negative evaluation of 
the opponents. Running second 
to McCain in New Hampshire, 
Bush sought to portray the sena-
tor as "too liberal" for 
Republican interests. He 
denounced McCain's tax plan as 
too timid and even claimed it 
would raise taxes, which was a 
misrepresentation. When , 
McCain suggested saving much 
of the surplus for Social 
Security, Medicare and paying 
off the national debt, Bush com-
pared him to Al Gore. 

Gore's attacks on the 
Democratic side were more 
vicious. Time and time again, he 
cri>icized Bradley'S health care 
proposal for eliminating 
Medicaid and not leaving 
enough money for Medicare. 
However, this distorts the debate 
in that it ignores the fact that 
Bradley seeks to replace 
Medicaid with a better system. 
All citizens are hearing, however, 
is Gore's sound bite. Pro m 
health care, Gore moved to edu-
cation and agriculture, and 
relentlessly dug up decade-old 
Congressional votes on vouchers 
and farm policy that pertained to 
an entirefy different set of cir-
cumstances. The Gore campaign 
even new a New Jersey farmer to 
Iowa for the sole purposes of fol-
lowing Gore around and 
denouncing Bradley on agricul-
ture. 

Bush and Gore's tactics are 
quite intriguing - usually, it is

pie I interviewed that I was a 
student at UCSD, which is the 
truth, but I was technically 
lying by omission. 

I couldn't tell them that the 

information they were giving 
me in good faith would go 
straight to their opposition. 
Why? Because .the philosophy 
was, wnatever is good for the 
campaign must be done, no 
matter if I found it ethically 
appalling. The unspoken motto 
was: The ends justifies the 
means. 

So whenever I had to request 
information for the campaign, I 
had to give my name, phone 
number and add res at UCSD. 
So I was never off duty, because 
when I got to my room at 
UCSD, I often had over seven 
phone calls to return. 

It got to the point that I 
began to fear the ringing of my 
own phone. I knew that if I 
picked up the phone it would 
most likely be somelolitician 
returning my call an I would 
have to lie and get the informa-
tion the campaign needed. 
When the phone rang, I would 
shriek out loud in frustration 
and anger at having my private 
dorm room invaded by the 
slime and corru ption of poli-
tics. I hated it.

Hale's words do hurt. Last July, 
Benjamin Smith, one of Hale's fol-
lowers, went on a shooting ram-
page, for which he was immortal-
ized as a martyr among Hale and 
his followers. For the World 
Church of the rea tor, en eless 
murder is saintly behavior. 
InCidentally, Smith is now known 
as Brother Smith in the ranks of 
the World hurch. Also, Hale's 
initial demonstrations 'a t 
Northwestern resulted in vio-
lence. 

Hale clearly endorses disor-
derly, dangerous behav ior, and 
his word mClte violent hatred. 
"We struggle to win the Racial 
Holy War for our people's exis-
tence," he states on his Web si te. 
Continuing, he observes: "We 
perhaps planted more seed of 

. our peopll 's resurrection in [the 
past year] than in the 25 years 
previously." Their motto is 
"RAHOWA," which stands for 
Racial Holy War. War and re~ur­
rection imply violence on a grand 
scale. 

"We long for our revolution," 
Hale adds in another essay. Hale 
probably doesn't sanction every 
act of violence. But he does 
understand their effect. Those

For three months, my routine 
was the same: I would wake up 
ever Tuesday and Thursday at 
6:30 a.m., shower and run to the 
bus stop for the 7:41 a.m. bus 
that was always at least 20 min-
utes late. When the bus finally 
arrived, it would take over an 
hour to get to campaign head-
quarters. 

Then for the next four hours 
I would answer phones, do 
miscellaneous projects, go to ' 
City Hall, research and make a 
few calls. I also had the won-
derful opportunity to meet the 
public by collecting signatures 
of registered voters in order to 
qualify the candidate for the 
ballot. 

It was such fun to interact 
with so many abusive citizens

and on the streets. I was spit at,

Unfortunately I did not have 
the ability to spot convicted 
felons who had had their right 
to vote stripped away by their 
foolishness. Although it was 
pure hell, I did get the required 
number of signatures. That's 
the bottom line - get the job 
done. 

I did not even have the 
weekends to relax by myself or 
to spend time with my friends. 
Instead, I staffed political fund-
raisers, friend-raisers, street 
fairs and walkathons. 

I noticed a funny phenome-
non: the crowd. The candidate 
was invariably speaking with

snobs. This candidate didn't 
target the votes or pockets of 
the everyday middle class. 
No, this person only hung out 
with the people with the 
beach-side mansions and the 
big bucks. 

This got me thinking -

not the case. Whatever voters 
may think of the candidates'

have demonstrated sound ethi-
cal judgment by defying conven-
tional pollsters, special interests 
and, for the most part, refusing 
to engage in typical mud-sling 
politics.

opened my eyes to distrust all 
politicians - I've seen too 
much to even recount it all 
here. 

I' ll admit, I'm bitter. I liked 
my internship at the beginning 
until I figured out how the game 
was played and that I was 
trapped. 

This was my first quarter at 
UCSD, and because of the 
internship, I gave up participat-
ing in Revelle's Emerging 
Leaders Program, Revelle TV, a 
better job at the Guardian that 
required Saturdays free and get-
ting involved in student govern-
ment on campus. I thought a 
"reald'ob" in the "real world" 
woul be better than the college 
world where everything is pre-
tend. 

Now, after all my experi-
ences, I'd take pretend over real 
any day. 

Until I can stand alone with 
my values intact against the 
rapid deterioration of the morals 
of everyone that steps into game 
of politics, I will not get involved 
in politics again. That's my 
promise to me.

and report on politics and 
expose the corruption. Oh, what

Bradley, as underdogs, never 
had that opportunity. One mi~ 
take, and they are finished. 

If this nation is to have an 
honest, effective dialogue about 
the issues that shape its present 
and future, we must treat all can-
didates equally. We must not be 
swayed by negative attacks, 
cDeap sound bites or tactical 
ploys. The American people 
deserve better. 

The Iowa caucuses and ew

No Decision Yet in Austrian Government RUSSIA: Fate of rebels 
still unknown

By planting the Russian flag in 
Grozny, the Russian military 
will re-establish control over a 
city that was the scene of some 
of their greatest humiliations 
during the 1994-1996 war. But 
the capture of Grozny will not 
end the fighting. 

VIENNA, Austria - As thou-
sands marched here to protest 
the prospect of including a right-
ist party led by Joerg Haider in 
the government, President 
Thomas Klestil met Wednesday 
with party leaders Qut failed to 
announce whether he would 
accept such a coalition. 

The 20,000 or so marchers 
indicated that they were delight-
ed that the European Union had 
set off a diplomatiC crisis this 
week by threatening to isolate 
Austri diplomatically if the pres-
ident allowed Haider into gov-
ernment. 

"From Brussels to Vienna: No 
Government with Racists," one 
banner read. Another called 
Haider a "pop fascist" and 
"pseudo-Christian." 

The march, substantial for a 
country of only 8 million people, 
was peaceful. A pot of blue paint 
- the color of Haider's Freedom 
Party - was flung on the 
doorstep 'of the People's Party, 
the prospective coalition partner. 
Some protesters carried babies or 
marched under pictures of Che 
Guevara. Many more carried the 
circle of yellow stars that is the 
symbol of the European Union.

Schuessel, came and went after 
meeting with K1estil for an hour 
each. 

Haider said afterward that 
some amendments to the pro-

posed cabinet and platform were 
suggested by K1estil, who was 
unable to make a decision 
Wednesday in part because 
Schuessel needed to' meet with 
his own party to discuss the 
changes. 

Haider also said that 
Schuessel would be chancellor if 
the coalition was approved and 
that he himself would not be in 
the cabinet. "I will go back to 
Carinthia because my work here 
is done," Haider said of the 
province where he currently 
serves as governor. 

The drumbeat of international 
condemnation continued, mean-
while. Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright, visiting 
Croatia to praise its democracy, 
criticized the possibility of 
Haider's party entering the gov-
ernment. While "obviously the 
Austrian people have the right to· 
elect whom they want," she said, 
Washington has expressed its 
concern that Austria umaintain 
its good international reputa-
tion."

the Russian claims. 

And the Russian military's 
account was contradicted by 
Bislan Gantamirov, a pro-
Moscow Chechen paramilitary 
leader who has been fighting 
alongside Russian troops in 
Grozny. He said that thousan~s 
of militants were not trapped 10 
Grozny but had managed to flee. 

"Over the last three days 
about 3,500 fighters have left,"

how many are still in Grozny,

judged from afar, it seems clear 
that the fighting within Grozny 
has reached a turning point and 
that the Russians finally appear 
to be on the verge of taking the 
city. 
. Grozny, however, is a ruin 
and its capture is of more sym-

The militants, however, 
almost certainly never planned 
to keep the city. Their plan was 
probably to inflict high I?sses on 
the Russian side and then flee to 
fight another day. 

The Russian military said it 
had confirmed that Shamil 
Basayev, the Chechen warlord, 
had been injured by a mine 
while trying to flee Grozny and 
had lost a leg. Gantamirov said 
that he also had information that 
Basayev was wounded in the 
leg, but did not say how seiious 
the injury was. 

But the Russian military did 
not capture Basayev and his 
whereabouts were unknown. 
The rebels have also said that 
several of their senior comrm!n-
ders were killed in the attempt 
t!J escape from Grozny, includ-
ing Lecha Dudayev, the Grozny 
mayor and nephew of the first 
president of the breakaway 
republic.

COLUMBIA, S.c. - Riding 
the wave of his decisive victory in 
New Hampshire, Sen. John 
McCain (R-Az.) tore across South 
Carolina on Wednesday arguing 
that he is the candidate who can 
"attract people to our party who 
have been alienated and disen-
chanted" and carry Republicans 
to victory in November. 

Only hours after McCain's 
double-digit victory in the New 
Hamp hire primary shifted the 
contours of the Republican race, 
McCain and· a humbled Gov. 
George W. Bush both shifted their 
battle for the nomination to this 
conservative state, whose prima-

Wednesday . morning Bush 

spoke to students at Bob Jones 
University, a bastion of Christian 
conservatism, where he promised 
to keep "our ideas, Republican 
ideas, conservative ideas, at the 
top of the national agenda." 

At a subsequent news confer-
ence, Bush rolled out his latest 
prominent endorsement: that of

INTEREST: 
Govemement will 
buy back some debt 
ContI .... ed frOlll ..... 1 
Treasury Department announced 
a plan to buy back some of the 
government's long-term debt as 
part of an effort to deal with 
growing budget surpluses. 

The central bank allowed the 
economy to expand for the last 
severjll years at rates well above 
what conventional wisdom once 
thoug,.!'t could be sustained with-
out igniting inflation, betting that 
investments in technology would 
allow companies to absorb cost 
increases without raiSing prices. 

But in raising rates 
Wednesday, the Fed and its chair-
man, Alan Greenspan, made 
clear once more that the ceptral 
bank's growth experiment had its 
limits. The message Wednesday 
was that the Fed was increasingly 
reverting to its tradition of 
stamping out inflationary pres-
sures before they could endanger 

Quayle, who courted the votes of 
social conservatives in his own 
presidential campaign before 
ending it in September. 

Every few hours, McCain's 
aides ticked off new fund-raiSing 
totals from his Web site. By late in 
the day, they said, McCain had 
taken in $415,000 online since the 
primary ended. 

Although Bush has been lead-
ing opinion polls in South 
Carolina by as many as 20 per-
centage points, McCain said 
Wednesday that the record voter 
turnout in New Hampshire 
showed that he was the ,"elec-
table" Republican whose cam-
paign against big-monied special 
interests could broaden the party 
base. 

The Bush campaign sought to 
diminish McCain's victory by 
insisting that its superior organi-
zation and campaign war chest 
would allow the Texas governor 
to run a SO-state campaign.

became the longest on record. 

The Senate took up 
Greenspan's nomination to a 
fourth term Wednesday. Both 
parties said they expected an 
overwhelming vote in his favor 
on Thursday. 

By increasing its benchmark 
federal funds target rate on 
overnight loans among banks by 
a quarter point Wednesday, to 
5.75 percent, the central bank 
pushed rates above where they 
had been in mid-1998, when the 
Fed cut rates three times to help 
bring the global financial crisis 
under control. The Fed also 
raised its discount rate on loans 
to banks from the Federal 
Reserve system by a quarter 
point Wednesday, to 5.25 percent. 

By raising its official short-
term rates, the Fed puts upward 
pressure on rates paid for every-
thing from credit cards and mort-
gages to business loans. Banks 
immediately said that they would 
raise heir prime lending rates.

Senators Press for Answers 
on Gene Therapy Case 

WASHINGTON - Federal 
health officials, under pressure 
from Congress to explain lapses 
in oversight of gene therapy, 
acknowledged Wednesday that 
they could not be certain whether 
experiments had hastened, or 
caused, the deaths of patients 
other than the 18-year-old man 
who died at the University of 
Pennsylvania last fall . 

"Most gene therapy trials are 
done in people with life-threat-
ening or terminal illnesses," Dr. 
Jay P. Siegel, an official of the 
Food and Drug Administration, 
told a Senate subcommittee. 
"Patients in those trials die. It is 
usually not possible to make a 
definitive determination" about 
what role gene therapy played 
in the deaths. 

Siegei made his remarks at a 
three-and-a-half-hour hearing 
before the Subcommittee on 

Public Health that covered a 
range of topics, from whether sci-
entists had been lru thful in 
informing patients about the risks 
of gene therapy, to why the FDA 
and the National Institutes of 
Health had not shared informa-
tion with one another. The two 
agencies monitor the research. 

At the conclusion, Sen. Bill 
Frist, the Tennessee Republican 
who is chairman of the subcom-
mittee, declared that the system 
for protecting patients was bro-
ken. "it's a multisystem failure," 
Frist said. 

Among those testifying 
Wednesday was Paul GelSinger, 
the father of Jesse GelSinger, 18, 
whose death on Sept. 17 has 
been the only one, as far as gov-
ernment offiCials know, directly 
attributable to gene therapy. 
GelSinger, who not long ago 
defended the Pennsylvania 

researchers as "ethical men," 
said he now feels he had been 
naive to have trusted them. 

He called for an independent 
patients' advocate to be present 
at discussions when risks are 
explained to patients consider-
ing taking part in experiments. 
He also attacked the influence of 
money from biotech companies 
in the race to making gene ther-
apy work. 

Gelsinger described the 
death of his son as "an avoidable 
tragedy from which I will never 
recover." 

On Jan. 21, the FDA shut 
down all gene therapy experi-
ments at the University of 
Pennsylvania, citing "numerous 
deficiencies" in the way the clin-
ical trial was run, including seri-
ous lapses in informed consent.

Team will fly to Houston

ConUnued from ...,. 1 
Johnson Space Center guidelines. This pro-
posal is then judged on its scientific merit 
and outreach content. After being selected, 
the teams are given three months to build 
their experiment and the opportunity to 
run their experiment aboard NASA's KC-
13SA reduced flight gravity aircraft. 

The team wilf fly to Houston at the end 
of this month where they will spend two 
weeks testing their experiment on a NASA 
KC-13SA plane, which simulates a low-
gravity environment. 

The first week will consist of pre-flight 
training, designed to make sure that each 
individual on tbe team is mentally, physi-
cally and emotionally prepared for the 
flight. During the second week, the team 
will fly on the aircraft in groups of two. 

Abbi, a third-year Revelle student, said 
the actual flight, which is often referred to 
by NASA workers as the "vomit comet" 
will prove to be an interesting experience 
for all four team members. 

"Basically, everyone who has flown on 
this aircrafWor the first time ha emptied 
out their stomach," Abbi said. "Therefore, 
the flight should be a very interesting expe-

ential outsid of the American academic 
realm. 

"Herbert Schiller wa a media intellectu-
al on a global cale," stated Kaarle 

ordenstreng, Finnish scholar and presi-
dent of the International Association for 
Mass Media Research. "His ideas traveled 
well in the divided world of the East, West 
and South." 

Schiller 's work was important in defin-

rience for all of us." 
For participating students, this program 

presents an opportunity to gain real-world 
experience. Konig, a fourth-year Warren 
student, said h ... was thrilled when notified 
that the team's proposal was accepted. 

"Participating in this program will give . 
us the chance to meet many interesting peo-
ple, as well as assist us in our relations with 
our professors at UCSD," Konig said. 

Patel, a third-year Warren student, said 
he is also looking forward to the team's trip 
to Houston. 

"This is one of the only experiences 
where we will be able to conduct this type 
of experiment by completing all of. the 
research with virtually no guidance," he 
said. "By allowing us to complete the 
experiment on our own, we are sure to have 
a very hands-on experience." 

Although already accepted into the pro-
gram, the team must raise their own fund-
ing for their experiment as well as travel 
expenses for the two weeks they will spend 
in Houston . With a budget exceeding 
$7,000, the team is attempting to earn 
money from the California Space Institute, 
a multi-campus research unit that is direct-
ly connected with NASA. 

"This experience will provide us with 
the chance to do something that not many 
people are given the opportunity to do," 
Abbi said. "We hope to educate people of all 
clges about our experiment after we return."

Arts and Entertainment 

Pre-pubescent girls are taking over MTV 

Perhaps you're familiar with MTV's Total Request Live (screaming fans line up on 
the streets of New York, holding up 
signs professing of love to the host 
Carson Daly whichever Backstreet 
boy is in the studio that day). It's 
not entirely a bad idea, giving your 
average Joe the ability to control 90 
minutes of air time. 

Unfortunately, girls between the 
ages of 10 and 15 are controlling 
the programming. This is not a fair 
representation. We do not all enjoy 
this music. Granted, some of you 
might enjoy the masochistic partic-
ipation in what I like to refer to as 
the "Poptart culture," but I person-
ally like to see real videos made by 
real musicians. 

TRL has distressed me so much 
that I want to encourage the view-
ing public to stop being so apathet-
ic over video rotation. Spare view-
ers over the age of 16 from fou r 
weeks straight of Backstreet's 
"Larger than Life" being played at 
number one. It's time to take mat-
ters into your own hands. It's time 
to start voting for the good music. 
It's time to grow up. 

You are probably wondering 
how to bet:ome an active member 
of the music voting community. 
You must follow one simple rule: 

Start requesting responSibly. 
Thoughtful requesting leads to sat-
isfying rotation (and music that not 
only your 13-year-old sister can 
enjoy). Here are four general 
guidelines on how to eliminate the 
evil trend of the Poptart culture: 
Know Generdon Poptart, 
F ... Get ........ PopUrt 

We are standing knee deep in a 
flaky, frosting-coated revolution. 
Pop mu ic has exploded. We are 
unable to go anywhere without it 
looming over our heads. It's 
impossible to watch television or 
go to the mall without pop culture 
taking over our traw of thought. 

Pop music is back in a big way 
and being used as a marketing tool. 
Poptart culture is drawing people to 
confonnity by disguising it as a 
popularity dub. It's a plot against 
mankind. It's clear that radio sta-
tions and M1V are bribed to rotate 
through only 10 songs at a time. The 
same songs over and over and over. 

Sometimes it's just one song 
over and over and over, but on dif-
ferent s tations. Conformity has 
gone surround sound. Santana's 
comeback with "Smooth" has 
erased all .other songs by being 
played on simultaneous broadcast. 
One afternoon that song was play-
ing on two radio stations p.lus MTV 

all at the same time. 
People must have been brain-

washed . The Poptart culture is 
being fueled by the request system. 
People are actually being fooled 
into liking this kind of music and 
asking for more. 
IlUUI)' on the Oybay Andsba), 

Let's make a prerequisite for 
bands: it actually has to be a band 
in order to be considered one. Peo-
ple who can play instruments. Peo-
ple without head-mounted micro-
phones and matching track outfits. 

Each and everyone of the cur-
rent 10 boy groups should die. The 
only thing different between all 
these boy bands is the fact that they 
have different names. 

Every one of these groups con-
sists one of the following members: 
"the blond one," " the cute one," 
"the tall, dark and handsome one," 
"the ugly outcast that none of the 
girls like," and finally "the one that 
wears strange clothing, funky hats 
or colored hair extensions." 

Any groups containing these 
five members should be elimina ted 
from the industry.

Chicago 
Comes to the 
Guardian 
Chicagos Next Dance F~ tival 
merges art and technology 
By HANNAH GRIFFITH 
Staff Writer 

Some may wonder why the Guardian would 
review a dance performance that happened in Chica-

·go. The answer is: for the same reason that newspa-
pers publish articles about political upheavals in far-
away places. What is true in politics is true across the 
spectrum of human experiences, the arts included: 
The ripples of what happens in other places will 
eventually reach us here in San Diego. 

Chicago's Next Dance Festival 2000 can be hailed 
as a good example for dance communities around 
the nation. The festival is a performance opportu-
nity for emerging or risk-taking choreOgraphers, 
and presents fifteen artists in 11 performances over 
three weekends. 

Such support for the arts speaks well of any city, 
and such organization and support among artists 
speaks well of them. To have a festival the scope of 
Next Dance is a goal worth emulating. 
The Perfonnanc:e 

Unique light and video-related effects, strange 
costumes, drama, humor and straightforward 
dancing all had their place in Next Dance. The 
evening began and ended with humorous dances, 
passing through, among others, the dark drama of 
" ... Through Night as Long as Rain ... " by The 
Dance COLEctive and the cute yet surprisingly 
insightful, "American Girls" of Paula Frasz. 

The most innovative pieces on the program were 
those of the Breakbone Dance Company, which used 
camcorders and lighting tricks to achieve spectacu-
lar visual effects in "Woe" and" A Day in the Life of 
Gauche Mann, Belgian Cartoon Solo-Artis!." This 
latter piece, the first in the program, was more of a 
performance art piece than a dance. A video of a 
quirky character dressed entirely in a yellow body-
suit - head, face and hands included - waking up 
and leaving his apartment was projected onto the 
scrim by a projector near the front of the theatre. 

The scene cut to Mann entering the front door of 
the Atheneum Theatre, coming down the same 
hallway that the audience had just walked in from 
themselves. Video projection met reality as the door 
to the theatre opened and a pink-haired camara-
woman backed down the aisle, followed by a yel-
low-suited form. The "Belgian cartoon artist" 
capered around innocently in the audience, then 
climbed on stage and pretended to be an amateur 
imitating dance moves and jumps. The only appar-
ent source of illumination on stage was from the 
larger-than-Iife video projection.

mUSic is good because of the 
artist's status. Record sales indi-
cate nothing. It's time to praise the 
avant-garde, to get excited about 
music that has never been done 
before. ('There are ways to make 
music enjoyable without sampling 
every single on your hit list, Puffy.) 

It is far more difficult to pro-
duce an entire album that can 
keep a fan's attention than pop-
ping out a single hit. It's called tal-
ent. Being a rock star is a three-fold 
responsibility: The artist/group 
must have the ability to produce 
more than one album, have equal 
greatness in live and recordea per-
formances and charisma. 

Achieving rock star recogni-
tion is the mastering of presence. 
It isn't about how many votes 
you get from the pre-pubescent 
public or how many days a 15-
year-old from Maine kept you 
standing at number four. It's 
about being charming, original, 
witty and able to admit that you 
didn't have a date to the prom. 
50 Now You Know 

Now that you're aware of the 
presence of Poptart culture, you 
might be afraid that it's too late 
to make a di!.ference. !hi~ is by 
no means a time to gIVe m. We 
are standing on the brink of a 
societal breakdown, and 
whether. you support my move-
ment or not, at least my concerns 

have been brought to the table. 
We've all suffered moments 

where our reality is intersected by 
the evils of flaky music. Maybe 
you've caught your roommate lis-
tening to the same music you heard 
at Club A last weekend. Maybe 
you've defended which boy band 
would look best dancing in dresses, 
or taken a moment to decide which 
one of your friends would make 
the best new Spice Girl. But have 
you once thought that something 
might be wrong here? Have you 
considered that Poptarts might be 
laking over the world? 

How long will it be before 
your joking turns into promotion, 
before you start requesting the 
very same videos that you once 
cringed at? That alone should 
scare you, should force you to 
rebel and take action before things 
really do slip beyond repair. 

The fate of TRL is probably not 
going to change very much. Other 
than new teenie-poptart fads com-
ing and going, we will be watch-
ing the same fluffy music for 
months to come. We could spare 
ourselves the frustration and tum 
off the 1V at 3:30 p.m., but TRL is 
the show we love to hate. Just real-
ize that the world does not revolve 
around top 10 lists and IS-year:-
olds wearing crop tops. There is 
better music out there. Now it's 
just time for you to find it.

CHICAGO: 
Multimedia dances 
are a big success 
CoIItllt •• d frOlll ..... 

This was all very cute, but what 
made the piece a worthwhile 
dance concert was the startling 
visual effect created by the fact that 
the performer was still being 
filmed. The eye received Mann's 
motions in triplicate: his dancing 
body, the video projection of him 
on the scrim directl behind him 
and his shadow in tlat projection. 
The result of this phenomenon was 
a stage filled with a fascinating, 
harmonious visual effect of the 
=s: = of one dancer. 

"Woe," which appeared in the 
second half of the evening, also 
used unorthodox lighting to great 
effect. A solo dancer in a sparkling 
silver dress and wig with wide, 
shiny silver ribbons moved slowly 
and fluidly, unafraid to take long 
pauses. The arms of the dress we.re 
about six feet long and contained 
some kind of stick so that the 
dancer, Sheldon B. Smith, could 
lean on them while standing up. 
This amazing costume was 
designed by Atalee Judy, the cama-
rawoman from "Gauche Mann" 
and reportedly, the driving force of 
Breakbone Dance Company. 

Judy, who<ites Elizabeth Streb 
(known for her equipment pieces) 
as one of her main influences, was 
once more an indirect part of the 
performance. This time holding a 
flood light instead of a camcorder, 
she again played the role of wizard 
behind the controls, illuminating 
and accenting the movement of the 
dancer as ~ circled around him. 

Her half-crouched compact 
form became part of the dance, as 
it was alternately haij-seen behind 
Smith and starkly silhouetted in 
front of him, her spiky hair stand-
ing out. Slinking around the edges 
of the pool of light and shimmer-
ing movement, she created a 
sense of voyeurism, as if both she 
and the audience were watching a 
personal ritual, and the enigmatic, 
shiny character seemed to enjoy 
being watched. 
Roses .... Stltlken 

The sense of ritual and magic did 
not carry over into the Same Planet 
Different World's "The Needy & 
Nasty," the last dance, which started 
off with five dancers doing ballet 
gestures that seemed frighteningly 
dull after the drama and l'ascination 
of "Woe." Even their reserved black 
costumes seemed uninventive. 

However, it soon became happi-
ly apparent that this seeming classi-
cism was just a backdrop for a series 
of comedic escapades, centered 
around roses. At first a single rose 
was displayed, tossed, coveted and 
kidnapped. The rose was a pretext 
for the dancers to follow each other, 
do some good partnering and staJk 
each other. 

At one dramatic point in the 
music, the two men skittered briefly 
out of the wings, left elbows rigidly 
above their shoulder like a shark's 
fin, head turned fixedly towards the 
oblivious, lyrically dancing women, 
then immediately exited. The a'udi-
ence found this hilarious, but they 
laughed even harder when the 
motif was repeated later in the 
dance with the roles reversed, the 
women stalking the men. 

The choreographer, Jsun 
0hIberg, played with what is tra-
ditionally expected from male and 
femaJe dancers. Costumed along 
gender lines - short-legged urn-
lards for the two men, long skirts 
for the three women - the male 
and female dancers were impossi-
ble to mistake for each other. A 
Jarge gender gap was initially rein-
forced by classIcal partnering, the 
large strong men lifting the smaJler 
women. Then, however, without 
so much as a blip in the rest of the 
classicism, a man assisted his part-
ner, one of the two smaller women, 
in a jump, and she turned around

By a Thread at the Che 
Canadian indie band discusses their roots and history 
By REID MONASTER 
Staff Writer 

After a long road trip wherein 
the van's transmission blew out 
and where they played "Koo's 
Cafe" in Santa Ana until 1 a.m., 
Canada's By a Thread came from 
Fullerton to perform at the (he 
Cafe on Tuesday, Jan. 25. 

Regardless of the hectic sched-
ule, this talented four-piece band 
was still upbeat, due to surpris-
ingly excellent turnouts, good 
responses and refreshingly inter-
ested fans at their shows. 

By a Thread received a nomi-
nation for "Best New Band of 
1998" by Vancouver's premier 
weekly The Georgia Straight, got 
signed to the well-respected 
Huntington Beach label Revela-
tion Records and had their debut 
album, Tht LAst ofTht DGydrtams, 
aired on Vancouver's local radio 
station CFOX. 

. Happy (bass), Joe (drum), 
John (6Uitar, vocal and lyrics) and 
Sean (guitar) explained that, so 
far, this year's trip has been better 
than last year's trip to San 
Diego's Empire Club, where only 
10 fans attended their show. 

By a Thread has played 
numerous venues throughout the 
West and won the support and 
appreciation of many towns that 
they performed at. 

"(Our favorite California. 
show was) at the Bottom of the 
Hill in San Francisco with AFI 
and the erve Agent ," said 
Sean, followed by the band's 
agreement. Bya Thread's favorite 
show of all time was a living 

room show that they performed 
in Logan, Utah. By a Thread 
explained that they enjoyed the 
people and the response they 
received there. They have also 
performed with Ten Foot Pole, 
GOB and Gameface. 

Long drives, little food, infre-
quent showers, long hours and 
little pay can be the back-break-
ers for life as a small band, but By' 
a Thread manages to maintain a 
positive outlook on touring. 

"Good shows make it worth it 
if your heart's in it," Sean said. 
"This is what we want to do right 
now - get our music out there." 

As for success at this point, 
Sean added, "We have had good 
reviews; More and more people 
are "showing up. It's encourag-
ing." 

By a Thread described 'Canada 
as a utopia where the police ride 
around on yaks and carry wood-
en sticks that look like guns 
instead of real guns. According to 
the band, the movie "Strange 
Brew" is an accurate portrayal of 
their homeland. 

By a Thread is one of those 
bands (such as Face to Face, 
Goldfinger and Dave Matthews 
Band) whose performance is just 
as good live as on the album. 
Blending together brilliant vocals 
by lead singer John, a four-piece-
band and lyrics with intense 
depth and emotion, By a Thread 
has come up with a unique and 
powerful sound. 

The intimacy and quality 
acoustics of the Che Cafe comple-
mented the band's sound and 
made for a memorable concert. 

The entire playlist was good, 
and songs like "Surface," "A Stale 
Goodbye," "Crushed Beneath" 
and the radio-friendly song "The. 
World to Me" were almost better 
live than on the album. They 
even played a new song 'Taint-
ed" and maintained a high level 
of intensity throughout the show. 

The only drawback to .the 
show was that the UCSD crowd 
seemed comatosed by the perfor-
mance. Fortunately, By a Thread 
delivered their show successfully, 
as did Bright Eyes, following 
their performance. 

The Che Cafe regularly puts 
on quality shows for reasonable 
prices and is a pretty cool place to 
hang out. Built to Last, The Nerve 
Agents, Palpatine, No Reply and 
In Control will be performing at 
the Che Cafe on Feb. 5 at 3 p.m. 
eo to www.chtcafe.com or call 534-
2311 for more information. 

By a Thread went on to Las 
Vegas to play Sound Barrier with 
a brand new transmission and 
all. For more information on the 
band go to Rev.1Iq.colII or

Grub and Beats 
La Jolla's Galoka provides a relaXing 
setting with tasty snacks and good music 
By CHAKO SUZUKI 
Contributing Hiatus Writer 

Sunday nights are always 
dreary because Monday is on the 
f1ipside, and kids are on the look-
out for that one last event that 
they can close their weekends off 
with. This night can now be filled 
with an evening of tasty organic 
Indian food and DJ Mike Czech at 
the turntables in the restaurant 
Galoka. 

Dinner is priced at approxi-
mately $10 a plate and it is defi-
nitely worth every penny. Galoka 
has exquisite vegan and vegetari-
an dishes and even gives you a 
choice of how spicy you would 

. like your food . 
Galoka provides a relaxed 

atmosphere for after-study hours 
(the kitchen closes at 10 p.m.). 
Smooth jazz music plays, and 
refined and eccentric artwork 
decorates the walls. Starting at 
around 9:30 p.m. and going until

and returned the favor. 

The motif continued as the men 
and women lifted each other with 
ease and grace, dispelling many of 
the stereotypes about gender roles 
in partnering. 

midnight., the bar open and 
holds a small dancefloor for the b-
boys and b-girls, an open mic and 
DJ Mike Czech, who spins strictly 
hip-hop from the sounds of Souls 
of Mischief to L.A. Symphony to 
A Tribe Called Quest. 

The scene is intimate and the 
beats are off the hinges. For those 
that eat in the restaurant there is 
no cover. However, if you are 
coming solely for the music there 
is a $3 cover. In addition to Sun-
day's hip-hop night, Galoka fea-
tures yet another hip-hop night 
on Wednesday and live improvi-
sational jazz nights Thursday 
through Saturday. For even more 
encouragement to try out Galoka, 
all these events are open to all 
ages and not too far from cam-
pus. 

Galoka is located at 5662 La 
Jolla Blvd., in downtown La Jolla. 
Call 551-8610 or visit www.meta-
morphcreations.com/gaioka for more 
information. 

The dance, like Jennifer 
Grisham's clean, potent "Alucy 
Glimpse" from earlier in the 
evening, made excellent, clean use 
entrances and exits from the wings. 
Like in all the dances in the pro-
gram, the dancers were both techni-
cally sound and good performers. 

If the succeeding weekends mea-
sure up, it will be worth packing 
bags, grabbing winter coats and tak-
ing a trip to a dty of real winters and 
great dancing.

to be one of the top quarterbacks 
in the league. With James behind 
him, the Colts have a lot to Look 
forward to for years to come. At 
this moment, Vegas is taking 
bets on next year's Super Bowl. 
And who are the favorites in the

Indianapolis Colts.

Women's epee, usually the 
strongest team of the three for 
UCSD, posted .impressive indi-
vidual records against some of 
the best collegiate fencers in the 
nation. 

Hannah Griffith led the way 
with a 16-11 record while team-
mate Julia Kulla-Mader posted a 
record of 13-14. 

"With a full team, we would 
have been a real force to deal 
with," Lee said of the epee squad. 
"A it is, we have to [be content] 
knowing that we fenced well and 
can hold our own in woman-to-
woman combat."

some credit. Acquiring Faulk 
. was pure genius. With this bit of 
strategy, and a lot of luck (the 
Rams would not have been in 
the Super Bowl this year had 
Trent Green not broken his leg in 
the pre-season) they went from 
perennial doormats to Super 
Bowl champs. 

As much as it pains me to say 
it, the future is bright in St. Louis 
as well. Head Coach Dick 
Vermeil's retirement won't slow 
the Rams a bit and Kurt Warner 
will again lead them to a success-
ful season next year. I guess the 
Colts and the Rams have proven 
the old economics adage tha t 
there are such things as mutual 
gains from tf!lde. 

Women's foil also fielded only 
two fencers, but still managed to 
defeat two of their opponents. 
The team was ' led by Josephine 
Roberts, who posted a record of 
18-9 on the weekend. Her record 
was the best of any woman fencer 
for UCSD. 

Lee said he was happy with 
the way the two members com-
plimented each other, and also 
added that Roberts put herself in 
good position for a spot in CAA 
Nationals with this performance. 

The Tritons wilf battle some 
competitors closer to home when 
they travel up to Santa Barbara to 
fence against UCLA, UC Santa 
Barbara, USC and fencing power-
house Stanford. With lhis tough 
eastern competition, the Tritons 
plan on doing what they do best 
-licking on California schools

VICTORY: 
After weeks of anguish, 
volleyball finds success 
ContIIIued from ..... 11 
More blocking result ing in kills for 
UCSD followed as Ben Vernon showed 
his strength at the net. The Tritons went 
up 14-8, and by no surprise, Zack Hite 
polished off the game with a kill. Tritons 
two, Leopards nothing. 

The Tritons continued all of thei r 
momentum into the third game. On paper, 
it was their easiest game of the match, but 
in reality it was a nard fought battle for 
UCSD. 

The Tritons jumped out to a 6-0 lead 
and for all practical purposes, the game 
was in the fridge of being over. 

At this point, the wnole team seemed 
to possess more energy on the court then 

they had d isplayed all season long. You 
could see the excitement b rewing in their 
faces as the end of the game neared. In . 
their burning anticipation to leave RlMAC 
that night with a win, La Verne managed 
four points. 

The teams played to sideouts for near-
ly ten minutes. Yun and Hite then came 
alive as they capped a UCSD night of solid 
ball-movement and blocking with key hits 
to finish off the Leopards. -

Five Tritons scored in double digits 
kills in the contest with Z4ck Hite leading 
the barrage wi th 19. He was equally 
strong defensivery with 11 digs. 

UCSD topped LaVerne in the kill col-
umn by only one, 75-74, but the Leopards' 
35 errors to the Tritons' 15 was a major 
factor in the game. UCSD hopes to ride 
this momentum into Saturday's match 
against Division III rival UC Santa Cruz.

'The Trade' was the 
cause of success 

There were many memo-
ries of Super Bowl XXXIV 
that were wor th talking 
about. Every football fan will 
forever remember " the 
Tackle" as the Titans came 
within one yard of fo rcing 
the first Super Bowl overtime 
in history. Most people will 
remember " the Catch" (no, 
not the one by Dwight Cla rk) 
when Isaac Bruce ran in for a 
73-yard touchdown to fuel 
the sputtering Rams to victo-
ry. 

Most people, however, do 
not remember "the Trade." 

0 , there was no trade 
that occurred during the 
Super Bowl that made the 
outcome of the game change, 
but there was a trade, before 
the season even began, that 
shaped not only the fate of 
the Super Bowl, but the 
entire regular season and 
playoffs. 

Of course, I am talking 
about the pre-draft trade that 
sent Marshall Faulk from 
Ind ianapolis to the Rams in 
exchange for the fourth pick 
in the draft. Tha t fourth pick 
la ter became Edgerrin James, 
the rrobable choice for rook-
ie 0 the year, the pro-bowler 
and the NFL's rushing 
leader. 

Many people would say 
that the Rams would have 
been as good with James as 
they are with Faulk. Many 
people would also say the 
same thing about the Colts. I 
disagree. 

Although James and 
Faulk are similar kinds of 
backs, both of which are able 
to ca tth and run the ball, 
they have a few important 
differences. 

Eaulk gave Kurt Wa rner a 
mature back he cou ld rely 
on. Early in the season, when 
Warner 's superman-like 
qualities were not yet discov-
ered, teams would focus on 
Faulk and Warner burned 
them for it. By the time 
Warner was an accepted star 
in the league, he had a level 
of confidence so high that 
nobody was going to stop 
him. Coming from a pa rt-
time grocery store box boy, 
Warner 's confidence could 
have wavered, but Faulk's 
abili ty allowed him to 
mature into the league's 
MVP relatively quickly. With 
a rookie like James as his 
back, Warner wou ld have 
been less confident and pos-
sibly could have crumbled 
under the pressure. 

The Colts' lack of maturi-
ty showed through when 
they lost to the Titans in the 
playoffs. Despite their inabil-
ity to make it to the big 
game, they alsq were win-
ners in th is trade. The Colts 
have the youngest team in 
the leagu e and three legiti-
ma te supers tars on offense 
that are extremely young.

Volleyball Mauls 
Divisional Rivals 
DOMINANCE: After a depressing string of losses to Division 

. I opponents, the Tritons destroy La Verne University 
By BRIAN WELlES 
Associ~te Spor ts Editor 

Well volleyball fans, your Tritons have 
come up with something special. A win in a 
game. Three games! A match victory! UCSD 
did it the easy way by dismantling the 
University of La Veme Leopards in three 
straight games 15-11, 15-9, 15-6. 

The Leopards themselves had been 
suffering a slump by not win-
ning a single game in the 
first six matches of their sea-
son. The Tritons succeeded 
in exacerbating the Leopard sense of 
loss with the sweep. The loss for La 
Verne made their record a dismal 0-7, while 
UCSD is now 2-5. 

It wasn't all fun and games for the Tritons 
it the first game. Both teams battled to tie the 
score at 4 early on. 

La Veme seemed to be winning the match 
at an emotional level, as the Leopards had 
their share of mid-court screams and con-
gratulatory gestures after burying some big 
points 9n the Tritons. 

Both tearns committed a lot of hitting errors 
and violations which slowed down the flow of 
the game greatly. Both tearns' games appeared 
strong at these stages of the match, but it was 
UCSO's exploitation of La Verne's middle 
which gave the Tritons the victory in the game. 

Also, the Tritons made the presence of their 
blocking on the right side of the net felt right 
from the beginning. 

It was the duo of Jordan Hove and 
Earnest Yun that especially kept the 
Leopards offense in their cage. Yun con-
tributed to the Triton effort defenSively 
with eleven blocking attempts in the match. 

With the score 14-11 in favor of the 
Tritons, La Verne hit the ball long on 
the attack and UCSD took the game 

15-11 . UCSD had captured 
its first winning experi-
ence at home thisJear. 
Donald Chen Ie off the 

second game with a kill to make it 1-
o Tritons. By this point in the game, 

La Verne was on its heels and having to 
defend more than their talent would allow. 
The Tritons had the Leopards diving for 
balls on rallies created by the Tritons. Zack 
Hite also provided a spark on offense with 
a huge block for a point on the left side and 
it was 5-3 UCSD. The teams then played to 
a series of sideouts. La Verne tied the game 
at six when Leopard middle Nate Silva 
smashed the ball just inside the line. Hove 
and Yun continued their blocking magic 
into this game, but half-way through, 
LaVern,e was still hanging tough at 7-7.

Fencers 
Slice Foes 
in Chicago 
EN GUARDE: Despite 
not fielding full teams, 
UCSD's fencing squad 
does well in Midwest 
By BILL BURGER 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD fencing team had its 
Super Bowl Jan. 21st th.rough 23rd, 
when it traveled to Chicago for the 
Northwestern Invi tational. 

This tournament was once a UCSD 
staple, but this is the first time the 
Tritons have participated in it in many 
years. 

"We simply had to have exposure to 
eastern United States competition," 
Head Coach Stuart Lee said. "This kind 
of experience is inva luable to our 
fencers." 

Because funding was low, the 
Tritons were unable to fly a full team to 

~hicago, ~et they still had an impres-
sIve show mg. 

The men's team, which was only 
short one fencer, went 4-5 on the week-
end and had two losses by only one 
bout. 

"Given that we forfeited three bouts 
to every team, I am very impressed 
with our results," Lee said . "Had we a 
full complement, I believe we could 
have very possibly [been] looking at a 
6-3 record." 

Given that many of their competi-
tors received scholarships to eastern 
schools for fencing, that is very impres-
sive. 

The men's saberists, led by Tedd 
Padgitt, compiled the best record of 
any group at 6-3. Craig Johnson and 
Andrew Anfora were also up to the 
task as the team showed that they are a 
national force. 

"Andrew improves with every 
competition," Lee said of his sopho-
more team member. " He matched 
Craig victory for victory and was the 
key to several squad wins over the 
weekend. II 

The men's epee team went 5-4 dur-
ing the weekend. The team was led by 
Min An, who posted an impressive 16-
11 record against stiff competition. 
Freshmen sensations Shawn Pfiel and 
Mike Davis-Allen both ended the 
weekend with 14-13 records. 

The men's foil squad only fieJded 
two competitors, sophomore Wes 
Bellanca and last year 's rookie of the 
year Jackie Hunt. Bellanca posted an 
incredible 23-4 record on the weekend 
and 'was undefeated against six of the 
nine schools he fenced against. 
Bellanca and Hunt were able to defeat 
three schools even though they were 
forfeiting a third of the bouts. If third 
team member Jackie Ngo had been able 
to attend the meet, things might have 
been very different. 

".1t's extremely difficult to win a 
nine-bout match when you forfeit three 
bouts going in," Lee said. "Had Jackie 
been at Chicago, I dare say men's foil 
would have gone 8-1 or 7-2 at this 
meet. II 

The women's team only fielded five 
fencers for nine spots, but their indi-
vidual records were very impressive. 

At women's saber, Jessica Spuehler 
fenced alone and posted a 10-15 record. 

"This meet was key for Jess," Lee 
said. "I am astounded at how she has 
risen to a competitive level so quickly."
