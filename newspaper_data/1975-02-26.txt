Student Worker Hours at 
Muir Caf~teria Reduced 

Barren Unaware of Cuts; 
Some Lose Third of~ Pay 

b"y Charles Heimler 

Student worker hours at Muir 
cafeteria have been cut this week 
as a result of either increased 
food costs or management 
miscalculation, depending who 
you talk to. 

Seventy-eight hours were cut 

from this week's schedule, and 30 
more may be slashed next week, 
according to Craig janes, student 
supervisor at Muir, who is in 
charge of scheduling the 85 
student,S 8Tlployed at Muir.

Local Action 

Whether Janes' or Mitchell 's 
reason s is the correct on , 
Mitchell decided to reduce the 
meal cost to the cafeteria by 
slashing student hours, which 
allows the same number of 
people to be employed without 
some being fired. 

The result for many of th 
workers is two to three less hours 
a week, which at UC San Dlego ' ~

almost $30 less earned ea h

Echoing its opposition two 
weeks ago to the concept of a 
University Towne Center, the 
St udent Cooperative Monday 
voted to oppose the proposed 
community of North City West, a 
40,OOo-person development that 

Del Mar Mayor Tom Shepar4 . 

would be situated northeast of 
Torrey Pines State Park. 

I n addition, the Coop voted to 
move nominations and elections 
to fill the Budget/Resource Croup 
coordinator position vacated last 
week by Rudy Luque to March 3 
and 10, respectively. 

City Council Vote Tomorrow 
Local external affairs coor-

dinator Marco LiMandri, along 
with Del Mar mayor Tom 
Sheppard, informed the Coop 
that the San Diego City Council 
will vote on the plan for Ncmh 
r ·· , . . I... I[y west tomorrow. 

North City West is a 4200-acre 
si te that would be built on what is 
now zoned as agricultural land. 
Last year the San Diego City 
Council voted against the plan by 
a f;ve to four margin because of 
the costs of construction and 
utilities to the city. 

This year the dev~lopers of 
North City West have said they 
will form an assessment district to 
cover the costs of acquiring 
school sites and of construction 
of sewer and water lines. Land-
owners in North City West would 

pay a certain amount of money 
each year to finance and pay 
back the bonds of the assessment 
district. 

One of Sheppard's arguments is 
that with the accessment charge 
on the land which he says may 
total from S50 to 100 million , 
there won 't be any opportunity 
for low-to-middle income housing 
developments. 

Sheppard added that the "c ity 
should try and cleanup thp 
downtow!"! ~:~;i" ':'!!tr. the mon~~ 
it would spend on North City 
West. 

it .was also _poiDted _out by 
Sheppard that the growth rate for 
the next 30 years in San Diego 
"has already been met in existing 
(housing) developments." 

The Coop then passed a 
consensus motion of opposition 
to the North City West proposal. 

After asking students to "ex-
plore the beautiful valley" where 
the development would be built, 
LiMandri urged all interested 
students to attend tomorrow's 
City Council meeting at 9 am to 
voice their opinion. He added 
that he would organize rides to 
the meeting, which will leave 
campus at 8:30 am from in front I 
of Urey Hall. 

BRG 
Turnin~ to the BRC, the Co-

op heard a motion from acting 
coodinator Alec Nedelman to 
open nominations for a new 
coordinatol lith voting to take 
ptace next week . 

Earlier this week, Rudy It!Q'-~ 
resigned as coordinator after 
weeks of haggling within the 
comm ittee and the Coop. 

Once again controversy 
erupted surrounding the state of 
the BRC . Some students 
questioned the hurried 
nominations and elections, and 
paralleled them to the last BRC 
elections, which many felt had to 
allowed for sufficient exposure af 
candidates . 

When questioned by the Coop 
as to why the BRC would need a 
coordinator before March 10, 
Nedelman explained that the 
BRC would be listening to the 

Communications and Pro-
gramming Boards' presentations 
for nex! year's budget in the next 

f~ wl'eks, and a ninth member 
and coordinator would help 
matters. 

BRC, member Ann Carberrv 
said that a new coordinator m 

BRG acting coordinator Alec 
Nedelman . 
help, but might also slow the BRC 
meetings because of the on-the-
job training the coordinator 
would have to absorb.. 

The Coop then passed a motion 
to "instruct the BRC to delay 
presentation of the tpm-
munications and Programming 
Board budgets until next quarter. 

Printing Coop 
In other Coop business, Carrett 

Ceuner explained that the 
Printing Coop, located on the 
second floor of the Student 
Center , had r~(~!'!ed 33,UOO 
sheets of orders . Ceuner asked for 
helpers on the press.

The UC San Diego chapter of 
the National Student Coalition 
Against Racism is currently 
planning local actions protesting 
school segregation in Boston . 

Tonight, a ci ty-wide teach-in 
will be held at Casa Real at San 
Diego State University at 7:30 
pm, according t~ tJC5D 5~udent 
Make Zarate. 

Speakers will include Ken 
Msemaji , head of the Black 
Federation of San Diego, Robert 
johns, head of Afro-American 
Studies at State, and a special 
report from Boston . 

Boston Is Focal Point 
Zarate, who attended 

December 's National Student 
Conference Against Racism in 
Boston, feels the issue in Boston 
is a central focal point for 
organization against racism 
throughout the country. 

" People came to the con-
ference to think out a strategy to 
defeat these racist attacks," says 
Zarate, who hopes tonight 's 
teach-in along with future rallies 
will help show solidarity of 
support for black students in 
Boston . 

" These actions will show 
people are in favor of defending 
the black community," he says. 

The conference that Zarate 
attended included over 2,000 
people from across the countrv 
ann n~,",I - t' 27 t to' r ' 

.. _ .... _v .,,~ came rom s a es, 
147 colleges, 58 high schools and 
113 organizations. 

The conference included a 
teach-in and workshops, and was 
highlighted by the call for a 
National March on Boston, on 
May 17 by Thomas Atkins, Boston 
NAACP president. . 

The conference was called in 
response to the failure of Boston 
schools to desegregate this fall 
following a Supreme Court ruling 
last summer declaring segre-
gation ill eRa I. 

Numerous attacks on blacks 
have been reported, along with 
ttyee lynching cttempts. 

Zarate attended the conference 
using money donated to UCSD 
Conference Against Racism by 
the Revelle Co"ese council, the 
Revelle Parent's fund and pl'ivate 
individuals. 

Rallies will be held at U SD 
and SDSU on Aprrl 16, and on 
March 3, a meetmg of th U D

For the students whose sole 

'We're

a Business ' 

incorr.e com{;; tram their 
cafeteria job, the effect can be 
devasting. Based on working 15 
hours a week, the usual load cut 
for some workers means the 10 
of one-third of their income 

" It eems when things get 
tough students get screwed," 
says Janes " There 's no un -
derstanding of the fact that the 
students really need the money " 

Janes says he doesn't know how 
long the reduced hours will be In 
effect, adding that the situdtlon 
" isn't as temporary as people 
would like it to be ." 

Mitchel says the cutting IS 
tempOrary until next month . 

Cafeteria Won't Suffer 
Mitchell also says service In the 

cafeteria will not suffer because 
of fewer working hours. 

"The managerial staff and the 
full-timers will have to do a little 
more," he proposes. " Everybody 
is going to have to work just a 
little bit harder." 

"We deal with the hardship 
cases," says Mitchell , "and we're 
dealing with them the best we 
can , but we 're running ~ 
bu;iness .:: 

Larry Barrett, who head the 
UCSD food and housing services, 
and is Mitchell's boss, said 
Monday he was unaware of the 
cutting of hours, adding he was 
gone three days last week . 

The managers at each of 
UCSD's cafeterias are given a free 
handi n runningof their cafeteria 
under guidelines imposed by 
Barrett. 

This arne type of hour- uttmg • 
has occurred at the Revelle and

but no work reductions are 
currently In effect .

K1ienberQ Rehiring 
Sexism Hidden .. in 'Rigor'? 

Sonwtimt' twly l.lIit fall. Proft's~r Su!ij\n Klt'irbt>rg was notifil'd by 
tilt- history d!>p.1'1Illt>nt that ht-r rontrart wa~ not !pi"!: to be wrwwro: 

T~·rt'.I:;ons Iliv('n WfOrt' that ht'r It'aching had rt'Ct'iwd mixed r('Views 
,mel th.lt hei !>4'holarly work' was not of sufficient quality. Many 
l'tudt'llts strongly objeoct to this eleoci~on on the part of the history 
dt>p.lrtmt'llt . In ordt'l' to (omt' to some understanding of waht is 
holppE'ning .md begin to bt> able to specualte ~ 10 why, these reasons 
must bt> closely etaminro. 

The implicit assumption in arguing for non-renewal on the basis of 
ll1i:.ro rt'vit'ws is . in order for a professor to be worth keeping, there 
must be praise cOIT'ing from every mouth opened. Besides being an 
unrealistic standard, it should be pointed out iA actuality it is not ('Ven 
usro as a standard; if it were, the faculty population of this campus 
would be decimated, not just in the history department, but in all 
departments . All professors, good and bad, are going to get mixed 
reviews . The fact . is. the.overwhelming response to Kleinberg's teaching 

h~ been very positive .. The CAPE ratings are one valuable indicator of 
student response, and Kleinberg "as te~f~ hi~ ratings in CAPE. It 
appears that in making decisions thar niattJ!!', student response is used 
rather selectively: mixed reviews·bl!come a reason for not renewing 
Professor X, but are accepted as a fact -d life (negative response from 
students is ignored) when it comes to Professor Y Or Z. Yes, we can all 
agree the time is long overdue that departments and administrators 
took student opinion seriously. However, the use of student reviews as 
a basis for non-renewal qlll be deceptive; it gives the impression Ihat 
what students think does in fact cOllnt, which all too often is not the 
case. CAPE has been ignored; many letters of positive recom-
mendation to -the history department have been ignored; personal 
communications with the chairman and others in the history 
department expressing students' strong objection to the departments' 
decision have also fallen on deaf ears. 

There is a substantial number of students who feel the history 
department and LCSD as a whole would really suffer a loss if Kleinberg 
were not rehired. Many students feel the quality of Kleinberg's 
teaching is the very reason she should kept. 

But this is not the only consideration. In addition, Kleinberg happens 
to be the only person in the history department qualified to teach the 
history of women-the importance aid relevance of wh ich is increasing, 
not decreasing. :C:~:n~fg is also the only urban historian in the 
department, and the enrollment in her urban ni;i:o.y G?:.:r~~ indicates a 
definite interest in that area . With the current drop in enrollment in 
history courses, it would seem that the department could ill afford to 
lose someone whose courses have the drawing power which Klein-
berg' s have. ' 

She is also one of three professors who have put together a course on 
the impact of race and ethnicity in U.S. history. The response to this 
course has been good, with enrollment well over one hundred. And, 
like the history of women, it is a course which fills a tremendous void . 
The very necessary process i:J writing back into history the experiences 
.and impact of groups of people who have been forgotten or ignored 
must continue to be reflected in the conten t of history courses at this 
University . 

The point here is simply that elim inating a person from the faculty 
means a lot more than losing a good professor . The process of hiring 
and firing professors is tied in with the p:ocess of making decisions 
about what is !ping to be taught and from what perspective. These are 
decisions which affect our education in a profound way; those of us 
who are not Simply guiding a spoon into o·ur mouths wi" continue to 
make every effort to influence them . In this case, what we have the 
option of learning about this year, we very well may not have next year 
unless something is done. It should be noted that last June when a 
student approached the chairman of the history department and asked 
him whether the department intended to hire someone else to teach 
the history of women if Kleinberg were not rehired , he responded that 
they did not . 

The contention that Kleinberg's sc holarly work is not of sufficient 
quality isalmost impossible for a non-historian (especially a student) to 
cha"enge . .we are, ~ definition, not in a position to be able to know or 
judge such things. But there is some evidence, including a presentation 
of a paper at a historical conference, a request to write introduction to 
a book, and an acceptance of an article for publ ication-all in the last 
six months, which suggest that Susan Kleinberg is indeed recognized in 
her field . 

The question to be considered is what we as students can do to 
insure that Sus;·n Kleinberg is rehired . When a person is being con-
Sidered for rea'Jpointment, the following sequence of events takes 
place: the indi' ·idual department evaluates the professor and makes 
their recommel\d<lt ion to th!' hllnget committee, and the budget

Letters 
·Picture Cards Mark National Trend 

The University is once again trying to establish 
its discredited elitist policy. This time it is throuah 
the establishment of picture ID cards. Now they 
want the students not only to be good Jews going 
to the gas chambers, they want them to finance 
the trip too . 

Who wi" benefit from picture 10 cards? Not the 
students . What makes the classification of 
"student" something special? Having a student 
number, or lacking one, doesn't separate you from 
your friends and allies . How many of you need ID 
cards to recognize your friends . Only police 
agencies benefit from ID cards. And the University 
Authorities are a police agency. 

By- identifying ~nd arbitrarily catagorizing 
individuals, the authorities can apply different 
sanctions against various groups, divide them, and 
prevent their working in concert for common 
goals. 

You may think this is petty since new rules have 
only been applied to social gatherings such as 
danc.es . But creating a viable new culture is the 
issue . In past years "non-official " people were 
welcomed on campus. It was this open, friendly 
poliCY that helped create the "youth" or "counter-
culture." 

Now the Un iversity wants a closed , 

authoritarian campus. If you are not going to be 
the Jews, maybe they want you to be the elite SS. 
Neither position benefits you . This is not just a 
local problem. The U~ Justice Departmen-t is 
pushing for a national ID card, allegedly to stop 
i"egal immigration . Before WWI a person could 
travel around the world without a passport; how 
long before you'll need a passport to go to 
Arizona? Perhaps you'll be consiaered an "i"egal 
alien" for moving from one administrative 
jurisdiction to another. 

Here is one chance to stop a reactionary trend. 
DON'T FUCK IT UP!

The final decision is made by the Chancellor . 
In the case of Professor Kleinberg, the history department has made 

the recommendation that her contract n<x be renewed, and the budget 
committee is now in the process of carefully reviewing the evidence on 
which the case against Professor Kleinberg has been made. This is 
defini.tely a point at which student input might be able . to ha~ 
impact . A departmental recommendation does car.ry ~ fair .arnount of 
weight, and if it is not challenged, chances are that It Will be approved. 

During the past few months, students have been writing letters to 
the chairman of the history department, Ramon Ruiz, with copies to 
Frederick Bailey, professor of anthropology and chariman of the 

budg~t committee, protesting the history department's decision . Other 
students who feel that Kleinberg should remain on this campus should 
write suer, ieit~~; ;;; ~~n as possible. The importance of these letters 
and the petitions which are bein~ ~~~C!.' lated should .not be un-
derestimated. At the same time, however, we must cv;;~ii1:':~ !~ con-
sider other ways in which student pressure can be brought to bear . A 
sustained effort on the part of students who are committed to seeing 
Susan Kleinberg retained at this University is necessary if this situation 
isto be rectified .

Swan Lake 
The Dorothy Chandler pavilion 

stands as a monument to the 
omnipotence in Lo,- Angeles 
cultural circles, at least, of one 
Dorothy Chandler, who is often 
pictured in her son Otis' los 
Angeles Times with thousands of 
chi ldren from all over the city 
before a performance of the 
Nutcracker Suite, or something 
equa lly endurable by thousands '- J* H. or-J_ 
of chi ldren. F7 ~.,-

(Of COlM'se, I remember my 
mother and father packing me off 
to see the Nutcracker Suite when 
I was very little, in an effort to culturalize me at an early age. In ad-
dition, the Detroit school system would often put me in a big yellow 
bus and send me, with others of my occupation, to the Nutcracker 
Suite. I estimate that I have seen the Nutcrack-:r Suite 47 _imE>f .) 

The music center in LA owes its existence primarily to Mrs. Chandler 
as does, probably, the interior motif of the D.C. Pavilion, consisting 
primarily of great and cold slabs of marble, inset with gold letterins in 
choice spots, and ·rather intimidating arrays of mirrors, making it 
appear that there are many more of you than perhaps there are. The 
sensation of hopeless chaos is amplified by the Procession of Personnel 
up the twin staircases and elevators (I expeCted to see Kafka's Karl 
Rossmann running one of the latter, 24 hours a day, having no idea he 
is delivering people to an afternoon of squinting at figures on a stage 
which seems to be miles away) . It is advisable to walk up the staircases, 
so that you may straighten your tie, your dress, or Wiggle your pants 
down a few inches so that an indiscrete portion of your socks does not 
show. 

What I am trying to say is that Soto and I took two acquaintances to 
Swan Lake at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion last Saturday, so that our 
cultural intake this quarter would not be limited to overdoses of UC 
San Diego drama and its preoccupation with nearly incompreh~nis ble 
one-act plays. The story line of this epic involves an Eligible Prince who 
inadvertantly makes romantic contact with a certain Swan, who, 
luckily, is allowed by the spell she is operating under to be a graceful 
and beautiful ballerina during performances. The Swan was par-
ticularly fun to watch , though we were very close in our balcony to the 
Face of God, and thus unable to see the face of the Swan very well. The 
Swan was su rrounded, usually , by a number of Lesser Swans, of which 
Soto felt there should have been dozens more. Of course, it has been 
suggested that Soto would find Swan Lake palatable only with ' Esther 
Will iams swimming the lead role, or perhaps in a Buzby Berkeley 
produc tion . Unfortunately, the American Ballet Company is not 
eq uipped to put 1000 SWilns in sequined gowns on the road . White is 
cheap. 

Soto's acquaintance's father, with whom we stayed for the weekend, 
said he had seen Swan Lake performed in a small town in Russia . In 
that performance the Prima Ba"erina had been a 2()(}pound woman 
who insisted on falling down with dull thuds. Soto, as you may know, i~ 
laki ng a modern dance class next quarter, so that he might refine 
further h is sense of rhythm and balance. 

The previous two sentences are relevant to each other only if one is 
fami liar with the present state of Soto's sense of rhythm and balance . 

I should adrl that the Prince and th-e Swan nnd happiness , even 
though they hurl themselves off the top of the set onto a mattress at 
the end of the performance. They are, says the program, reunited in 
some sort of afterlife. 

I realize now that I have so far been deficient in providing critical 
commentary I quote, then, Daniel Cariaga of the Times, who is ob-
viously more qualifi ed than I to provide just that : "When the climax to 
Act Thrf'e proved a mere 22 fouseHes , performed dutifully . a polite 
audience withheld its applause." 

I was there , and that sounds good to me.

Moorehead Speaks Friday 

'Civil Rights Gains at Stake' 
by Mark Stadler 

"The civil rights gains of the 
past twenty years is what's at 
stake in Boston." Laura Morehead 
said, speaking of the attempts at 
the desegration of Boston 's 
schools . Morehead, a black 
activist from Pasadena, spoke at 
the "Speak-Out on Racist Attacks 
in Boston" at Muir Friday. 

Morehead was the main 
speaker of the event.-which also 
featured Mike Zarate, UC San 
Diego's representative to the 
National Student Conference 
Against Racism held in Boston 
earlier this month, and Olga 
Paran of the Women's Center. 

~y17~rch 
Zara te spoke first and sa id that 

at the Student Conference, 
NAACP President Thomas Atkins 
announced a national march on 
Boston on May 17. (See story, firM 

the impression that black 
students wanted to kill all the 
whites . 

Morehead said Boston claims 
to be against enforced bUSing and 
for neigh borhood schools and 
educational equality. This she 
judged "a bunch of lies ." What 
they really stand for , she asserted, 
is in the grafitti scrawled on walls 
in South Boston : "Ki" niggers! 
Niggers !p home!" 

'She dismissed the idea that 
Boston whites were against 
enforced bUSing by claiming 
"Busing is something almost as 
American as apple pie." She 
supported her claim by saying the 
yellow school bus is a fixture in 
American history and that Boston 
has been busing schoolchildren 
for the past 25 years . 

Neilhborhood Schools 
Morehead disputed the notion 

Ihat the whites arE' for nt'lgh 
borhood sthools by allE'gtng Ih,1I 
blacks have always hE'en buwd 
past their local school dnd to ,Ill 
all -black school 

, 
Morehead related that In 1'17 i 

the BOston School Comrrl 111('1' 
had refused 64 million doll~JS In 
federal funds because they would 
have had to deVise .1 
desegregation plan If the school 
committee had favored ~ equal 
education , Morehead <ald. It 
never would have ·refused the 
money that could hav'e benefitted 
both white and black students. 

Morehead po inted ·out that 
"racists all over the ceuntry 3re 
looking to Boston a& the test 
case." They ,-,nderstand that If th E' 
racists win there the f;el tng could 
spread ~nd turn back the gains of 
the past:twenty years .

P~ople 

The Americans are a gay, carefree people. A good part of their wages are spent 
for various torms of entertainment, the fact that they a re easily amused nol-
withstanding. They enjoy going to parties and getting enebriated in a va riety of 
ways. They love to dress up in their colorful native costumes and while away the 
hours at a friend's house or a restaurant or nightclub, listening to m usic. 

The popular conception of the fat American in his "skivvies", holding a can of 
beer and lazily watching television is a gross generalization. Most aren't like this 
mythological American. Other myths that seem to have had their origins in 
television commercials are of housewives in curlers, Americans discussing their 
bowel problems over the phone, Americans gossiping about their next door neigh-
bor's house odors. Americans neither sweat more than other people , nor do they 
have duller teeth. 

Many Mexicans complain about the bums on city streets accosting them. and 
begging for dimes and quarters. It is best to treat these people with sympathy and 
understanding, not with derision. Some day the American government will do 
something to help these people. In the meantime, if it is wi thin your means to help 
them out. then do so. 

Ir. America, your altitude will determine how much you will enjoy your visit 
with our Friends to the North. And if you are depressed by screa ming sellers at 
the marketplace, the bums on Skid Row, or the Americans who make sly jokes 
about you in a foreign tongue. remember : It was just a sheer accident of birth 

Shoppina in ~nd Around S.n Diego that kept you from being born there. 
The unit of exchange in the United States is the dollar. The donar is worth about 

12 pesos. While many merchants wiD accept the peso. it is probably best to ex-
change your pesos for American currency before entering the country. This is 
helpful in the event of a problem : No one in the United States has been known to 
turn down a few "bucks' . 

The downtown areas of most American cities have at least several department 
stores. These can range anywhere from cheap to expensive. But if you're looking 
for a good deal , the place to go is the Swap Meet. 

The San Diego region possesses several of these Swap Meets, generally in the 
suburbs and unincorporated areas. Here the natives go to buy and sell new and 
used merchandise. Occasionally, you win see some homemade articles, but the 
majority of goods there are manufactured. To be avoided are the sellers who deal 
only in new items. Usually, the goods they sell are sold cheaper in regular 
department stores. 

The marketplace can be a very noisy place, with the sellers hawking their 
wares in loud voices, the tinny music played through small radios, and the voice 
over the loud speaker proclaiming the availability of refreshments at the con-
session stand . 

A good point to remember is that the American is likely to raise the price in 
order to make a hefty profit. So, if you haggle with him, ma ke some jokes 
(Americans love jokes) and criticize his goods, you can probably work down his 
price to something reasonable. If he proves to be stubborn, give him your final 
price, and walk away. It is more than likely that he will call you back and sell the 
item for your price. If he doesn 't , there is always some other American willing to 
sell for your price.

1M . BS 
An Open Challenge to UCSD 

David Perkins, after smothering himself with a cherry pie in his 
attempt at winning the Cherry Pie Eating Contest last Friday, issued an 
open challenge to any UCSD stupent who wishes to try and eat two 
Zoo's at Fa rrells. He claims he can out eat anybody, and although he 
didn't prove it on Friday, he will race anybody through the two Zoo's. 
with the loser paying the bill. 

Since Perkins failed in his spectacular try at consuming pies. 
someone else had to win, and John lulegian did . John managed to 
devour somewhere in the neighborhood of 2 1/2 cherry pies . Special 
credit must also be given to Steve Coon and Matt O'Brian, both of 
whom managed to choke on two of the cherried goodies in the alloted 
half hour time period. 

Dean "PorkV" Pattterson proved himself to be the glutton he claims 
to ~, ~wning his pie in 2:02 minutes to waddle away with the speed 
eating title. 

The Superstars Contest finally came to a close last Friday as the 
Softball Throw and the 60 yard dash were held . Outstanding per_ 
formances by the "Pickerprints ." Aliena Salmon in the Softball Throw 
and Rodger Stockstill in the sprint iced the victory for Lee Johson's 
team. 

Salmon tied Chris Broderick of "None" in the accuracy throw, while 
Stockstill placed second to Frank Longo in the sprint . The''pickerprints'' 
finished with 4,277 .5 points, followed by "None" with 4,037.5 ; the 
"Jets" with 4,000; "Team No. 1" with 3,900; and the "Ogden Athletic 
Club" with 3,770.

Baseball Season Begins

by Kirk Robinson The Tritons erupted for five Left Fielder David lettuca has

The season began over the

with the T!itons taking an '11-2 
victory from Pacific Christian . But 
from then on it has been all 
downhill. First it was an 18-3

managed one final tally in ttie top

Coach lyle Olsen gave credit to 
the team for the comeback, being 
especially pleased that the team 
did not give up when they were 
down six runs. He did however, 
feel that t~e team played poor 
f~damental baseball. The team 
made several costly errors that 
gave USD a majorit'y of their runs . 

Mark Farrar and John Clark

good freshman talent to its roster, 
headed by the Youngdale 
brothers. Dave Youngdale IS a 
fine fielding shortstop, while his 
brother Doug will handle a lot of

ISirens Stop UCLA, 4·01 
Last Sunday. the Women 's 

Rugby team showed UCLA's club 
the reason why UCSD won the 
Califor nia state Women ' s 
championship last year . 

The game was not as close as 
the final score of 4-0 would in -
dicate, as the siren s were con-
stantly pres uring the Bruins deep 
in their zone . Near the end of the 
firs t half, the pressure paid off , as 
some tine tacklin g and dropped 
passes led to the lone try of the 
game by Val Cardeiro. Debbie 
Holstein attempted the con-
vers ion, but her kick fell several 
yards short . 

The sirens had severa l op-

portunities to score early in the 
first half, but a few close calls 
made by the referee negated the 
efforts of the team. One of th 
calls came when th e si rens had 
actually crossed the goal line, but 
failed to push down on the ball, 
s ignifying the completed try. 

The second half was played in 
much the same manner as the 
fi rst , With the women playing 
mostly in UCLA's zone . Due to 
some good defense by the Bruins, 
and a couple of dropped passes, 
the Sirens were unable to score, 
yet they were able to keep UCLA 
bottled up In their end of the 
field .

On Death staff to the needs and feelings ot patients approaching death . 

The conference will now be 
extended to hospital staff on all 
medica l floors . 

Growing recognition by UC San -
Diego's University Hospital of ine 
lingering trauma of terminal 
patients in modern medical care 
resulted this month in official 
backing for a continuing program 
on how to handle the question of 
death with dying patients . 

Believed to be the first in th e 
statewide UC medi cal system , the 
program has been developed by 
the Omega Com mittee, group 
composed of nurses , social 
workers . c haplain, psychologist,

work has attracted wide interest . 
The San Diego Public Health 
Nurses Association has scheduled 
meetings on the subject. Also, the 
Veterans Administrat ion hospital 
in La Jolla is forming a group 
similar to the Omega committee, 
and local colleges have called on
