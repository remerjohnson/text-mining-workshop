G.I. benefits in danger 
Mllii?ns of veterans could lose part or all of their GI 

educational benefits If they don't act promptly, Gordon R. 
Elliott , Director of VA's Southern California Regional Office , 
warned recently , 

Elliott explained that those who e benefits are in danger 
were discharged between January 31. 1955, and June I , 1966, 
Por these veterans, eligibility for VA educatIOnal assistance 
payments for GI Bill schooling expires on ~1ay 31. 1974. 
whether they are enrolled at that time or not. 

The, expiration date is fixed by a 1966 law which extended

Youth obtains 2000 signatures for marijuana 
PRE ORICK BRADSHAW TURNER 

III, 21. of Redwood City, has single 
handedl y collected over 2,000 
signatures on petitions for the 
California Marijuana Initiative dnve 
in a period of less than a month, 
according to tnforma tion recently 
released by Robert Ashford , State 
Coordinator of the initiative. 

Asked abnut Turner 's 
accomplishment, Ashford answered 
" Brad is simply a bundle of POSltIV~ 
energy. He IS a perfect ymbol of what 
the inItiative is all about - a people's 
campaIgn to effect a rational and 
humane change in the law It IS the 
dedication of volunteers. like Brad, 
that will qualify this measure for the 
ballot and , in November, vote it into 
law," 

The California Marijuana Initiative 
IS a state-wide movement to place an 
InItiative on the November , 1972 ballot 
whIch would remove crimInal 
penalties for adult personal u e of 
marIjuana In order to qualify the 
mea ure for the ballot , CMI must get 
more than 326,000 signatures on its 
petitIons before Ma y 1st. 

According to Turner himself. the 
secret of his success is simply hard 
work "I simply work at CIrculatIng 
the petItion every chance I gel." he 
says. I go to shopping centers, super 
markets, Iheatres, anyplace where 
large numbers of people gather," 
Asked about the kinds of people who 
have been SIgning the petItIOn, Turner 
claims that they represent a broad 

cross-section of society: both young 
and old , the middle-aged, housewives, 
people in business suits, and college 
students. " The important thing," he 
says. " is to qualify the measure for the 
ballot. It does not really matter 
whether people are for or against it. 
What does matter is that they get a 
chance to vote on it in November ," 

When he first started to circulate the 
petition, Turner admits to having been 
somewhat apprehensive. He was 
concerned because the initiative deals 
with decriminalizing marijuana, that 
he might be bothered by police or 
shopping center owners, Assured by 

attorneys for the initiative that the 
circulation of petition s wa s 
constitutionally protected, Turner 
decided to go ahead , He has sine 
learned that the advice he received 
was accurate . According to Turner, 
the vast majority of shopping center 
managers and police officers recognIze 
that his actIvity in circulating petitions 
is in the " best American tradition." He 
has been bothered only infrequently , 
a nd then only by individuals who are 
misinformed. " It is usually a question 
of ignorance of the law on the part of 
some policeman or shopping center 
rna nager." Turner says

The Education of Ralph Ginzburg 
Kevin Olson 

Attacks on individual freedom , though thev may how a 
preponderance in one area , can theoretlcallv si>rlng ' from an\ 
part of the broad political spectrum. And as' the news rearhes 
me that Mr Ralph Ginzburg recently began serving a three-
year prIson term for convIctIon on an 1872 anll·pornog aphv 
law, not only this point, but also the concomitant injustIce 01 
such an attack on lIberty , IS brought out In the glaring sunlIght 
lor all to see For the conVIction of :'vir. Ginzburg on the charge 
of ·' using the malls for criminal purposes·' lie. mailing caples

balanced viewpoint. as not~ Ing less than a social absurditv and 
a patent miscarnage of justIce . 

:-.Ir, Ginzburg, for those who do not know, IS a leadIn~ pseudo 
Intellectual among the New York pseudo-avant·garde crowd,

the Village Voice, and similar denizens of :'Ijlghtmare Alle~' He

Barr~· Goldwater, short·llved oddities such as The Housew; fe 's

Homecoming and Harold 
Pinter 

Kathleen Woodward 
Th~ Humecoming, an important and 

disturbing play by Harold Pinter which was 
£irst presented in London in 1965. recently 
closed at the Cassius Carter Centre Stage 
after a scheduled run which was. I think , 
much too short. Expertly directed by Peter 
Nyberg, this production is further evidence 
that the caliber of theatre at the Old Globe 
is. on the whole, professional the year round , 

I! Dave McIntyre of the San Diego Evening 
Tribune had his way, however, the Old Globe 
would offer us a salt-free diet of frothy , 
fluffy comedy. We would have one Baref~t 
in the Park and Sound of Music after 
another, and there would be no room for such 
a serious play as Ptnter's Homecoming 
which is un settling rather than reassuring. In 
hiS review of this production , McIntyre 
expressed indignation at Pinter' s language, 
labeling it "v ile. scurvy dialogue," and 
further condemned the playas not properly 
fulfilling the moral purpose of the theater 
which IS. he implied , to extoll "the goodness 
of the human SPlrtt." The play. he charged 
shrilly. is depressing. not stimulating. and 
IS clearly the product of ~ "diseased mind " 

IS an intrusion and that his wife. a sensual 
woman of deliberate presence and shady 
past. is more than welcome. The play was 
billed as the sto ry of the four men in Teddy's 
family competin~ for Ruth's affections , but 
this is misleading. The four are not after her 
affection and there is certainly no contest 
involved. As soon as the business offer is 
s uccess fully negot iated to Ruth 's 
saltsfaction, sh agrees to stay on 
indefinitely as woman-m-common of the 
household 'and her husband quietly leaves for 
the U.S. 

He calls the language "vile." I would call 
It vital. One of the chief problems of our 
slang today IS that there are no real swear 
words left. no words to voice outrage, no 
colorful language of abuse. Pinter provides 
us 10 Amenca with new vocabulary. "you 
daft prat. " "old grub." "smelly scrubber," 
"you stupid sod." 

In one sense, then, the family that whores 
together stays together. But within the 
occaSIOnally surrea l contex t of the play it is 
not Ruth 's behavior or that of Teddv 's family 
which is shocking . In fact there IS a peculia'r 
logic to what is initially startling and 
bizarre. Ruth , we come to understand, has 
made the right decision. Between stertlity 
and decadence , it is decadence with ItS 
honesty , not hyposcrisy. and energy. not 
lifelessness, which IS preferable It is not 
Ruth 's open sex uality. but rather Teddy's 
lack o[ action which is offensive. lie is 
effete, weak , full of .. intellectual 
equilibrium ," the emasculated academiCian 
who is mcapable of dealing With anything 
which does not fall withtn his mlntscule 
philosophical province. His family. on the 
other hand , for all the quarrels and hostlhty _ 
is curiously healthy' everyone has a 
relatively strong sen e of self and knows 
when to protect themselves as individuals 
and the interests of th famil) as aunt!. Just what is the narrative of thiS play 

which Mcintyre hnds so corrupting and 
pornographic? After an absence of six years 
Teddy a philosophy professor at an 
Amencan University, returns to hiS home 10 
London with his wife Ruth The household IS 
an all-male quartet: liVing there are hiS 
father. a retired butcher and earthv old man. 
his upltght. self-regardtng uncle who drtves a 
cab, and hiS two brothers, one a not- too-
bright stud and the othe r a successful and 
qUick-think 109 pimp acted by Michael Miller 
who ~ave the finest performance of the play 
It soon becomes clear that Teddy 's entrance 

Within the world of The Homecoming then. 
Mclntyre's standard ethical categortes 
simply do not apply Ruth behaves neither 
morally or Immorally , but rather 
in tinctually . One cannot argu(' that Ptnter IS 
in pra Ise of human goodness. yet surely no 
one would dl agree that it IS a legitimate 
purpose of the theatre to probe Ihe dark. 
uncultural areas of our betng. and Pinter 
does Just thiS 10 a way that is always 
engagtng. tntellectallv stlmulaltng, and often 
very funny 

"Y ou Must Remember This ... Peter 
Bogdanovich is still Peter Bogdanovich."

Often an author will wrtte a

prJng softball IS off to a sunny start at VCSD with more 

teams and more people than ever before. Men 's softball has 
about tWice as many teams as last year, 34 squads divided Into 
4 leagues Coed softball IS the real doozy, though, as a 
whopping 49 ball clubs signed up to plav. F.nthusiasm for 
intramural has once again gotten over soii tudents. facultv, 
and staff Involved In a single activity, intramural softball , . 

The SIX coed leagues are packed with fun teams. serIOus 
teams good earns, bad teams, freak teams, straight team, 
conservative teams, radical teams. and on and on and on in

With the purpose of fostermg 
better international relatIOns 
between the United States and 
Mexico, VCSD lost all three of 
thei r games in the Gran 
Cuadrangular Estudiantil 
Internacional Ba quetbol held 
in Tijuana last week. Don 't 
think that it was the varsity 
basketball squad, however . 
Actually the team con isted of 
seven broken down intramural 
athletes and one outcast who 
volunteered for what would 
turn out to be an experience to 
remember. 

Monday evening, March 27, 
found ix of our intrepid 
adventurers making their way 
to the MeXican border 
worryIng if long hair would 
keep them from their 
appointed game. Luckily. the 
guards had been briefed, and 
there was no problem at the 
border crossing_ but the team 
stili had no idea what to expect, 
Gasps of disbelief arose when 
the team traveled under a 40 
foot banner across a Tijuana 
street advertiSing the

Arrival at the MUniCipal 
AudItOrium did little to qUiet 
the fears of the squad _ 
particularly upon seemg the 
mall fence u ed to separate to 

spectators from the court. The 
team was dressed in uniforms 
thre sizes too small and a 
tnfle obscene, and then. to 
their amazement. were 
marched out on the court wTth 
the other teams to stand for the 
,';Iexlcan :-Iational Anthem and 
a number of speeches given by 
local dignItaries. After the 
opening ceremonies. the
