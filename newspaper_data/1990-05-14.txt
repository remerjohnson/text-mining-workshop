'We Haven't Come a Long Way, Baby' 

Author and journalist Linda Ellerbee addressed the topic of the 
role of women in media in her presentation on Friday. 

Linda Ellerbee Speaks on Her 
Experiences as a Female Journalist 
By NICOLA WHITEHEAD 
Staff Writer 

Emmy Award-winning televi-
sion commenta tor, political ob-
server, and author Linda Ellerbee 
spoke Friday at UCSD as part of a 
two-day symposium on "Women 
and the Media: Roles and Represen-
tations." 

In an address spiced with anec-
dotes from her personal experiences 
as a female journalist, Ellerbee 
stre sed that women in the media 
have not come a long way, but rather 
have a long way to go. 

Ellerbee began her career injour-
nalism in the early 1970s, "with that 
first blush of women that, after the 
networks felt the pressure [of af-
firmative action], they began to 
hire. " 

"We were not there because of 
altruism on the part of the networks, 
or stations, or because of any right 

thinking on the part of the FCC. 
Women are journalists because 
of the civil rights movement of 
the' 60s and the women's move-
ment of the late '60 and early 
'70s," Ellerbee said. 

" Don ' t for a moment think 
that they wanted us. There was a 
feeling throughout the industry 
that putting the broads in broad-
casting would flat-out ruin the 
party. And who knows, they may 
have been right," she added. 

Change, Ellerbee argued, has 
not had a rapid effect on women's 
roles in the media. She spoke of 
the " twinkie" image most women 
on television news portray. 

agement is another problem that 
was addressed by Ellerbee. 

"You are meant to notice the 
women on television, primarily so 
you won't notice their absence in 
those rooms marked Executive 
Producer, Vice President, and 
President of the network .... That 
gla ceiling that you've heard 
about certainly exist [in manage-
ment]," she said. 

Ellerbee added that many fe-
male joumali ts are now seeking 
new management positions. 

"When [women] came into the 
business, we were all told you have 
to get out there and pay your dues. 
That was 20 years ago. And now a 
lot of women who do want to be in 
management are watching time and 
again younger, less q ualified men 
being promoted over them. 

Students Hold MeDlorial on 20th 
Anniversary of War Protester's Death 

"If you 've watched television, 
you know whatatwinkie is. They 
are the people you see deli vering 
the news who act the news, and 
model the news. They are the 
people of whom you do not 
worry, 'Have they written the 
new?' You worry, ' Have they 
read it?' They appear to have 
blow-dried their brains right 
along with their hair. 

"I think that television news 
is paternalism at its slickest. Most 
reporters don' t know better be-
cause that is what their boss tells 
them. They tell them that sex 
sells .. . . To young women, they 
give out the message that your 
time is better pent at modeling 
school than at journalism 
school," she continued. 

" How long will it be before we 
have a permanent female anchor 
on the evening news? I don 't know, 
and I really don't care. I am much 
more concerned with how long it 
will be before we have a female 
pre ident of NBC Ne ws, ABC 
News, or CBS News," she said. 

While women 's roles in the 
media have not changed much in 
20 years , neither has the media's 
attitudes towards women, Ellerbee 
claimed. 

A UCSD Student's Act of Self-immolation is Not Forgotten 
By CATHERINE DILLE 
News Editor 

Approximately 20 students held 
vigil in Revelle Plaza l1tursday on 
the 20th anniversary of the death 
of UCSD student George Winne 
Jr., who immolated himself on 
Revelle Plaza to protest the Viet-
nam War. 

On the afternoon of May 10, 
1970, Winne poured gasoline over 
his clothing and set himself on fire 
in Revelle Plaza. Winne was to

have graduated that June with a 
degree in Hi tory. 

According to a report in the 
May 11 , 1970 San Diego Tribune, 
Winne carried a sign bearing the 
red-crayoned message: "In the 
name of God, end the war." 

Winne died the following day 
of third and fourth degree bums 
over 95 percent of his body. Winne 
reportedly told doctors he was 
"protesting the war." 

With lit candles and flower , 
the UCSD students who gathered 
Thursday took the opportunity to 

discuss their feelings about the 
significance of Winne's death and 
their ideas of how war can be pre-
vented. 

UCSD student James Field said 
he and others chose to respond to 
Winne's death in the same way as 
UCSD students in 1970 did. 

"[My friends and I] talked about 
what we could do to remember his 
death. The day after he died, people 
spontaneously brought flowers and 
candles [to the place of Winne 's 
death] . We thought we could do 
the same," he said. 

One student added that Winne 
"saw a reality that was true in 
another part of the world and he 
tried to make an impact here at 
UCSD with his own body." 

Muirsenior Mike Flores said he 
did not believe Winne' s death was 
futile. 

"I am not sure Winne died in 
vain. He saw a situation so ex-
treme, he felt he was forced to take 
extreme action. It 's hard to imag-
ine someone doing this today," 
Flores aid. 

Andy Howard encouraged those 
gathered to "think about what will 
help prevent thing like this from 
happening again." 

One student responded that " the 
one thing we can do is to start to talk 
about [war]." 

Field added, "You've got to stop 
war before it happens." 

Students discussed other inci-

Panel Discussion Focuses on the 
Changing Role of Women in Print 
By SHERRY LOWRANCE 
Staff Writer 

Nigerian women writers and 
the social aspects of reading and 
writing were some of the topics 
addressed in a panel discussion 
Friday afternoon on the role of 
women in print. 

The panel, moderated by 
UCSD's Roben Horwitz and 
featuring Wendy Griswold from 
the University of OJicqo. Eliza-
beth Long from Rice University, 
and Sherley Ann Williams from 
UCSD was pan of a two-day sym-
posium about women in the media 
sponsored by Muir Colle&e, the 

Communications Department, 
and the Women' s Studies Pr0-
gram. 

Griswold' s topic of interest 
was Nigerian women novelists. 

"Given the fact that men and 
women experience life differ-
ently and have differing access 
to media, how do Nigerian 
women end up producing the 
novels they do?" she asked. 

According to Griswold. Ni-
gerian writers are not subsidized 
in any way. "Writing is a com-
mercial business only, and the 
novels reflect that," she said 

When asked what the target 
audience was for most Nigerian 

writers, Griswold responded that 
most Nigerian women, although 
not men, said they were writing 
for the Nigerian youth market. 

"They consciously avoid 
writing strictly for women audi-
ences," she said. 

However, if given a choice 
between writing a literary clas-
sic, writing a best-seller, or writ-
ing to inspire social improve-
ment, both Nigerian men and 
women said they would write to 
inspire social improvements, 
Griswold added. 

"Nigerian writers say with-
out a trace of embarrassment

UCB Conference of Lesbian & Gay 
Activists Canceled by Foundation 

BERKELEY - A San Franci co foundation ha can-
celed a $225,000 conference cheduled forthissummerat 
UC Berkeley in uppor! of student prote ts for greater 
campus diversi ty . 

The Critical Literacy Institute of San Franci co can-
celed plans for a month-long seminar for lesbian and gay 
activist this summer to demonstrate it support for the 
United Front coalition, which organized a recent two-day 
student strike. 

Luke Adams. executive director of the institute, said 
that UCB Chancellor I. Michael Heyman's lack of re-
o ponse to student demands for campus diversity com-
pelled him to move the seminar to another location . 

"After the strike it became very clear that Chancellor 
Heyman was not even going to honor the calls for good 
fai th negotiating:' Adams aid. ''There is no way that we 
can provide the university with revenues after there was 
no response." 

In a letter to UC Berkeley Conference Coordinator 
Mary Ellen Westphal, Adams said the group was " bound 
to re pecttheterms of and act in solidarity with the United 
Front strike against the campus administration. " 

''I'm thrilled that the institute is showing olidarity for 
our struggle on campus," said Susan Carlton of the Mul -
ticultural Bisexual, Lesbian, and Gay Alliance (MBGLA). 

The month-long basic training seminar for lesbian and 
gay students interested in community activism would 
have brought in almost $250 million - almost five 
percent of the total summer revenue, campus spokesman 
Jesus Mena said. 

"It is always a concern when we lose a program like 
this." Mena said. "We will do our best to mend the fence 
with the group." 

However, the institute would consider holding its 
conference on campus only if the chancellor meets tu-
dent demands to negotiate in "good faith" with the United 
Front, a multicultural coalition of lesbians and gays. 

The university has maintained that it is willing to 
negoliale on the student demands, which include a call for 
theestablishmentofamulticultural, bisexual,lesbian, and 
gay studies center on campus. 

Earlier this month. members of the MBGLA met with 
Carol T. Christ, provost of the College of Letters and 
Sciences, todiscuss the possibility of establishing a bisex-

"This could be the West Coa t's premier bisexual, 

lesbian, and gay studies center," said Liam Kernell, a 
member of the United Front and the MBGLA. "And the 
university would get some attention for creating the 
department." 

Heyman has no intention of meeting with the students 
personally, but other administrators are willing todiscuss 
student demands, Mena aid. 
UCLA Check-Off Fee Initiative 
Falls 300 Votes Short of Validity 

LOS ANGELES - The UCLA undergraduate ballot 
measure calling for continued funding of the California 
Public Interest Research Group (CALPJRG) has failed, 
according to the university 'S activity guidelines. 

Although the initiative received a majority of positive 
votes from undergraduates earlier this month, it fell more 
than two percent short of the 11 percent of the student 
body needed to cast positive votes. 

While the CALPIRG initiative received 2,201 affirma-
tive votes, more than 2,500 positi ve votes were necessary 
for the undergraduate government to recommend to the 
chancellor that the waivable fee be instituted. 

The negative check-off system, by which students who 
choose not to pay the $2 voluntary fee must initial the box 
on their registration fee cards and subtract the amount 
from the total, has helped fund the consumer and environ-
mental lobby group for almost four years. 

Undergraduate council members met recently to ac-
cept the votipg statistics on the CALPLRG referendum as 
accurate. but a decision on any further action was post-
poned. The council is expected to decide whether to 
recommend to UCLA Chancellor Charles Young that the 
fee be implemented. 

The initiative, although 2.3 percent shy of meeting 
universilY guidelines, did receive a majority of po itive 
votes. council members said Friday. 

Because Young has repeatedly stated that he will 
refuse to implement any negative check-off sy tem, the 
C~LPIRG vote wa " largely symbolic," Financial Sup-
ports Commissioner Sam Kaufman said. 

But Kaufman and other officers said they will support 
the implementation of the fee because council members 
must represent students democratically. 

While the bid for CALPIRG funding from the under-
g raduate student body has apparently failed, graduate 
students voted overwhelmingly to continue the fee on 
their registration card statements. CALPIRG supporters 
at that level are waiting to see if Young will challenge the 
student vote.

JOURNALISM: Author Linda Ellerbee 
Looks at Role of Women in Today's Media 
Continued from page 1 

"Throughout our business we 
have been told, 'You've come a 
long way, baby.' I remember 
being invited to the National 
Association of Broadcast-

the ABC prime time news show, 
"Our World. " A comment Eller-
bee made during a show focusing 
on the year 1973, a pivotal year for 
the feminist movement, sparked 

media, and change. 
"I do know that, as women, we 

haven ' t come a long way, and 
we 're not babies. It's not that 
simple .... I ask.ed myself, 'What 

ers to speak. Five women 
were invited to speak at 
the convention in Las Ve-
gas where 40,000 broad-
casters were cavorting .... 
We were thrilled to be 

'I've learned to do it your 
own way - only dead fish 
swim with the stream.' 

have you learned about 
change, and women, in 
all these years?' I've 
learned to do it your own 
way - only dead fish 
swim with the stream. 

asked, because women had 
never been paid much lltention 
by this organization, as if they did 
not really like to admit we were 
even in it. 

"We got up there to discover 
we had been invited to speak not 
to the broadcasters, but to the 
spouses. Of course, that was a 
long time ago - 1984. We've 
come a long way, baby?" 

Ellerbee described another in-
cident that occurred while she 
was the chief writer and anchorof 

-Linda Ellerbee "I've learned it' s the 
controversy. 

"Isaid, 'Ithink the failure of the 
Equal Rights Amendment to pass 
in this country was proof enough 
that we needed one.' Of all the 
things I said on television, of all 
my time there, that was the only 
time that a network said 'We must 
disassociate ourselves from these 

remark~.' But we've come a long 
way, baby. That was 1987." 

Ellerbee shared with the audi-
ence her reflections on women, the 

cluty of every citizen to 
keep her mouth open. I learned 
that if you don ' t want to get old, 
don ' t mellow. I learned that the 
best things in life aren't things .... 
I've learned that theeasierachange 
is to make, the less it matters .... 
Change, I believe, is a form of 
hope. To risk. change is to believe 
in tomorrow. Only the young can 
afford hopelessness - only they 
have time for it. The rest of us, we 
need our old memories and our 
young hopes."

Reconciling a Passionate Act 
On Thur day, students marked the 20th anniversary of the 

death of George Winne Jr., a young man who set himself on fire 
as a symbolic protest of American expansion of the Vietnam War 
into Cambodia. On May 10, 1970, Winne, a UCSD student, 
immolated himself in the middle of Revelle Plaza in broad day-
light,just as Buddhist monks were doing in Cambodia at the time. 
In front of him was placed a placard which read, " In the name of 
God, end the war." 

Winne' s death is an extreme example of what happens when 
national passion reaches a fever pitch. 1970 was an irrational , 
turbulent era. America was embroiled in a very unpopular war in 
Vietnam - a war which has left deep scars in the minds of the 
millions who witnessed the tunnoil of the time. 

We were a nation divided; many people believed the United 
States had no busine s in Vietnam, while others were quick to 
disagree. Tempers flared , often erupting into violent clashes 
between elements of the anti -war movement and local authori-
ties. Today, we reflect with sorrow on such tragedies a Kent 
State, where four students were shot and killed by national 
guardsmen attempting to disperse protester . 

By 1970, everyone knew the U.S. participation in Vietnam 

Winne's protest, though symbolic of the 
prevailing anger of many Americans, ac-
complished nothing. The bombs contin-
ued to fall ... Thousands of lives continued 
to be lost. The last American helicopter 
didn't leave Saigon untit April 30, 1975, 
almost five years after Winne's death. 

was an exerc ise in futility. That became clear back in 1968 during 
the Tet Offensive, when Walter Cronkite went on national 
television and said the offensive was "the beginning of the end" 
of the war from the U.S . point of view. The decision to expand 
into Cambodia was almost a las t-ditch effort to tum the tide of the 
war to achieve, as Pres ident Nixon put it, "peace with honor." 

Just as American participation in Viemam was futile, so, too, 
was Winne's passionate act. Winne's protest, though symbolic of 
the prevailing anger of many Americans, accomplished nothing. 
The bombs continued to fall in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. 
Thousands of lives continued to be lost. The last American 
helicopter didn't leave Saigon until April 30, 1975, almost five 
years after Winne 's death. 

Even after U.S . forces completely withdrew, millions of 
additional lives were lost in Cambodia ' s "killing fields" under 
the brutal Khmer Rouge in the few years following the war, not 
to mention all of the Vietnamese who supported the U.S . in Vi-
emam and, unable to flee the country, were rounded up by the 
Viet Cong for "re-education." 

Winne ' s death , though futile, was not entirely meaningless, 
and it has not been forgotten. Twenty students gathered in a 
candlelight vigil Thursday night at Revelle Plaza to reflect on the 
s ignificance of Winne' s death. To many in attendance Winne' s 
death was a profound statement about something he truly be-
lieved in . 

To some students, he will be remembered as a martyr to the 
anti-war movement - a man who died for a cause he truly 
believed in. To others, he will be remembered as someone who 
died a horrible death for no reason. 

One cannot help but wonder if Winne would have better 
served his cause by fighting for peace instead of dying for it. 

lL 's 15 years after the end of the war, and people are still 
divided about whether or not we should have even been involved 
in the first place. Winne is a tragic symbol of that debate. As 
George Bush said in his inaugural address, Vietnam continues to 
divide us, but now it is time to heal. 

Animals Play an Important Part in Research 
Editor: 

There are some who argue that 
members of mankind are equal to 
rats which are equal to goldfish, 
and so it is inappropriate to do 
animal research. Most of us don't 
agree and continue to fish on the 
weekends. 

ommend that they read Loeb and 
colleagues ' recent paper in the 
JOllrnal of the American Medical 
Association (1989, 262:2716-20). 
Or even simpler, that they go to 
the library, look up Nobel laure-
ates in medicine, and read a little 

of their research. Or perhaps the 
best thing would be to take some 
biology cour es. 

After all, UCSD should be a 
placeofleaming, not a playground 
for the ignorant. 

Thomas E. Hughes, Ph.D. 

But this is a logically consis-
tent argument. South African Democracy? 

The ones offered in your Opin-
ion section last week were not. 
The arguments were that basic 
animal research is of little use to 
medicine. Thi~ is an argument 
based on ignorance. And this a 
very dangerous kind of ignorance. 

For if the antivivisection move-
ment is successful in hindering or 
stopping animal research, it will 
impair or stop the basic research 
necessary to medical advance-
ment. Epidemiology alone, com-
puter models, or health food are 
not going to give us a way to save 
thosethatsufferfromdiseases uch 
as A.I.D.S.

damental relationship between 
science and medicine,. would rec-

In a recent speech to Parlia-

ment, President F.W. deKlerk fi -
nally shed some light upon the 
type of government and

Wisely adopting the concept of 
"power sharing," as opposed to a 
si mple "transfer of power," 
deKlerk underscored the need to 
avoid substituting the tyranny of 
the majority for the present miÂ·

Grad Students Ignored 
By RIMAe Sponsor Vote 
Editor: 

In Thursday's lead anicle ("Administration Approves Search 
for Commercial RIMAC Sponsors," May 10) there is a reference 
to "a referendum in April's AS. general election asking students 
if they approved of commercial sponsorship ofRIMAC in order 
to reduce student fees .. ." I'd like to point out two errors in this 
phrase. 

First, there was no guarantee in the referendum, nor by any ad-
ministrator since, that the enormous fee increase to pay for 
RIMAC will be mitigated at aU even ifmM buys the whole thing 
for us. 

Second, "students" were not asked this question. Undergradu-
ate students were asked, and those grad students like myself who 
tried to make our voices heard on this and other subjects pertinent 
to us were not allowed to vote. In the future, please don't report 
A.S. elections and resolutions as though they reflected the opin-
ions of the students of UCSD.

provisions have to be made to 
guarantee all parties against any 
one group 's domination. 

As citizens of the United States, 
we have grown accustomed to a 
well-developed system of checks 
and balances that prevents any 
single individual, race, or group 
from subjugating another. 

Most nations in Africa are not 
so fortunate, having been recently 
dominated by tribal governments, 
military regimes, and one-party 
dictatorships. 

If South Africa is to success-
fully evolve into a truly participa-
tory democracy, it will have to 
adopt a constitution that provides 
protection for the nation 's minori-
ties while guaranteeing equal 
participation by all. 

Fortunately, this is exactly the 
solution President deKlerkoffers.

Winne Was 
Not a Hero 
Editor: 

As much as I abhor war and 
seek constructive alternatives to 
aggression anywhere, I can't help 
but cringe at Walter Schmitt's 
remembrance of George Winne 
Jr. ("Remembering George Winne 
Jr.," May 10). 

My question is: What good 
comes from this "honorable tradi-
tion" of checking out when the 
world becomes too much to take? 
To Walter, George Winne is a 
hero of conviction. To me, he's 
dead.

Campus Cultural Diversity: More Than Just a 'Numbers Game' 
By CATHERINE DILLE, News Editor 

note speaker. I remember reading an article last year on student 
diversity where a black UCSD student was quoted as 
saying that sometimes he could go through a full day of 
classes without seeing another black student . 

I couldn't possibly believe this was true; it must have 
been an exaggeration. So I thought I'd count for myself 
and see how many black students I saw during a regular 
class day. I kept track fora couple of days - four the first 
day, then maybe five, but I saw my friend Janessa twice 
in one day, and she is black, so is that five or six? Quickly 
I lost track and forgot about the game. 

I was a little late arriving at the conference, and the 
lights were dim when I sat down. As I settled myself in my 
chair and adjusted to the lighting, it occurred to me that 
something was wrong. Well , not necessarily wrong, but 
something was making me feel uncomfortable, at any rate. 

will be the only black student in his philosophy discus-
sion or the only Hispanic student in her chemistry lab, 
knowing that there is a good possibility of not seeing 
another student of his or her ethnic group all day. 

Seem easy? You try it. 
All I know is that I didn't even make it through one af-

ternoon, let alone a whole quarter, school year, or college 
career. 

I was the only white person in the room. 
Suddenly I was the intruder. 

The point is, my attitude toward diversity was that it 
was only a game: a numbers game where people are 
counted and tallied. It never occurred to me that it did not 
matter whether that student saw one or 20 other black 
students in the course of his day_ The ethnic imbalance 
would be uncomfortable and unsettling for anyone in that 
position. 

Granted, my press pass and impending article ostensi-
bly gave me a reason to be there, but even still, I didn't be-
long. Over 200 conference attendees - Asian, Hispanic 
and black - were laughing and calling out their school 

I am appalled that the UC system does not already 
have in place a course curriculum which addresses cul-
tural diversity. If students could discuss issues such as 
what it is like growing up in another culture within the 
United States, and what being of a specific ethnicity 
means to individuals, then perhaps I wouldn ' t have felt so 
lost in the Students of Color conference, and students of 
color wouldn't have as much cause to feel lost within the 
UC system. 

â¢ GiiAimIAN Cl~up â¢ 
chants to one another across the room. 

Growing up, I could only imagine that I would feel 
uneasy in a situation where the racial tables were turned. 
My hometown is more than predominantly white. I'd say 
it's almost exclusively white, with the exception of a 
small Hispanic population and one black family. So I'm 
not really the most obvious spokesperson for cultural 
diversity. But I had an experience last quarter that gave 
me a chance to see how it feels to be "in the minority." 

The atmosphere was charged with a palpable energy as 
the students interacted. So what was the matter withme that 
I couldn't relax along with everyone else and get my story? 
After the opening introductions I left and came back later 
only to cover Justus' speech. 

Steps are being taken at some UCSD colleges to 
implement an ethnic studies requirement, but at the same 
time students at UCLA are picketing their administration 
to keep their ethnic studies majors. UC Santa Cruz 
students, led by their student body president, marched to 
their chancellor's door demanding ethnic studies pro-
grams, and UC Berkeley students are forming coalitions 
to show their administration that they are serious in their 
demands for a diverse faculty and student population. In 
tills coming decade ethnic programs are seriously needed. 

I imagine it must take a lot of mettle for a minority 
student to get up each day and go to class knowing that he 

You might recall hearing something about a Students 
of Color conference. It was held at the Price Center in 
April, and I covered it for the Guardian. It was the first 
time that delegations of ethnic students from all nine UC 
campuses had met to discuss the ethnicity issues that 
affect them, such as retention of black and Hispanic 
students in the UC system and the progress toward ethnic 
studies programs. Professor Joyce Justus, who was in-
strumental in the founding of Third College, was the key-

As I settled myself in my chair and 
adjusted to the lighting, it occurred to 
me that something was wrong. Well, 
not necessarily wrong, but something 
was making me feel uncomfortable at 
any rate. 

Perhaps the university isjust slow to listen to st udents' 
requests, or perhaps the university is too busy playing the 
numbers and quotas game to attend to students' real 
needs. 

I was the only white person in the 
room ... Suddenly I was the intruder.

The Hypocrisy of Animal Rights Animals and Medical Progress 
Editor: 

The letters from Douglas Anderson and 
Denise Nichols in the Guardian ("Spot-
lighting Animal Research" and "Editorial 
Bought Vivisector Line," May 3), chiding 
animal researchers for not "opening the 
laboratory doors" bring to mind a story 
attributed to Abraham Lincoln about the 
young man who used a shotgun to end an 
argument with his parents. After the jury 
found him guilty, the judge thundered, "Do 
you have anything to say for yourself be-
fore I pass sentence on you for this horrible 
crime, murdering your own mother and 
father?" The young man looked downcast 
for a few moments before he raised his eyes 
to the judge with a thoughtful look and said, 
"Well, I just hope Your Honor will have 
pity on an orphan." 

For years, animal rights activists have 
conducted a steadilyÂ·intensifying campaign 
of bullying, harassment, and violence aimed 
at intimidating researchers. 

The tactics of the movement have sunk 
below vandalism and theft, to the level of 
personal threats against scientists, deliv-
ered to UCSD last year on Christmas cards 
addressed to several researchers' homes. 

Given that mainstream animal rights 
groups have repeatedly refused to condemn 
such tactics, and that one of them, PETA, 
funnels money from its multi-million dol-
lar war chest to support the thugs of the 
Animal Liberation Front, isn't it more than 
a bit hypocritical to then suggest that scien-
tists should be more "open" to "question-
ing" by animal rights zealots? This is like 
saying that the ancient Romans should have 
beenmoreopentoque tioningbytheHun . 
In fact, the animal laboratories at UCSD are 
open to any member of campus, system, 
state, and federal inspectors, as well as 
members of Ihe news media. 

As for people like Ander on and Nichols. 
they talk about "asking tough questions," 
but this is a lame preten e; they have obviÂ· 
ously already decided what they want the 

answers to be. 
One wonders if the students who chanted 

and screamed at the recent animal rights 
demonstration at UCSD also believe that 
binh-control clinics should be "open" to 
pro-lifers. 

Picture the scene: Dozens of stem-look-
ing demonstrators, who have appointed 
themselves "guardians of the innocent vic-
tims," parade around the medical building. 
Speeches are made, heart-tugging photo-
graphs are shown, some of the demonstra-
tors smear themselves with blood (great 
visuals; the news media eats it up). 

As calls are made for those inside the 
building to change their evil ways, the air of 
self-righteousness is so thick you could cut 
it. 

This could be a description of the UCSD 
animal rights demonstration or Operation 
Rescue demonstrating outsjde Womancare. 
The pro-life mob champions unborn chil-
dren, the animal rights mob champions 
rodents, dogs, and monkeys; in all other 
essential respects, the attitudes and reason-
ing expressed by the participants are ex-
actly the same. 

I wonder how many students partici-
pated in both demonstrations? 

But perhaps consistency is too much to 
expect from the sort of thoughtless college 
kids who can be seen at campus cafeterias 
gorging themselves on animal flesh, or at 
malls paying ridiculous prices to wear ani-
mal hide, and then go demonstrate again t 
"unnecessary" biomedical research. After 
all, food and clothes feel good, while to 
tho e in the prime of their phy ical lives, 
chronic disease and death arc distant abo 
stractions, things that happen to others -
to old people, people in poor countries, and 
gays. 

It' easy to make fatuous statement 
about suppo ed alternatives to animal re-
earch when you're young and healthy. 

i n't it?

Editor: 
The following is a list of only a few of 

the diseases that are currently being suc-
cessfully prevented, treated, or cured as 
a direct result of animal research: 

1. Polio 
2. Diabetes 
3. Coronary heart disease 
4. Rubella 
5. Hypertension 
6. Cataracts 
7. Kidney failure 
8. Measles 
9, Diphtheria 
10. Lock-jaw 
The following is a list of a few of the 

diseases for which researchers are cur-
rently seeking cures, treatments, and 
preventions: 

1. AIDS 
2. Cystic fibrosis 
3. Multiple sclerosis 
4. Alzheimer's disease 
5. Parkinson's disease 
6. Lou Gehrig's disease 
7. Herpes 
8. Cancer 
9. Asthma 
10. Anhriti~ 
Some progress has been made against 

these diseases, however the work of 
medical research is far from done. 

The following methods are being ap-
plied in bio-medical research today: 

I. Tissue culture: Collections of cells 
in vitro can yield information; however, 
the actions of a single group of cells 
cannot represent the systematic com-

plexities of the living body. 
2. Computer simulation: Mathemati-

cal roodeHng using digital computers is 
a valuable tool, but the computer can 
only do what it is programmed to do. If 
the biological data needed to solve a 
certain medical problem is not avail-
able, it will not be found in computer 
hardware or software. 

3. Animals: Information gained and 
theories formed based on previous data 
in the scientific literature, tissue culture, 
and mathematical modeling must ulti-
mately be tested on animals. The final 
testing of new drugs and medical proce-
dures must be tested on animals before it 
is used on humans. 

Animal research is the final and es-
sential step in medical progress. Man 
bas been using animals as a source of 
food andclothing for about 10,000 years. 
Animals have been used in research for 
over 100 years. Animals are being treated 
more humanely than ever before - es-
pecially in the laboratory. Far more 
animals are killed for food and clotillng 
than for research. 

I suggest that animal rights activists 
take a close look at themselves. Do they 
eat meat, poultry, or fish? Do they wear 
leather shoes or belts? One must be pure 
in his thoughts in order not to be hypo-
critical in his actions. If after making 
this introspection, the animal rights ac-
Li vists still feel that we should stop kill-
ing animals, I suggest they go protest 
their local supermarket or shoe store.

PANEL: Authors and Poets 
Discuss Women in Print 
Continued from page 1 
that they are inspired by Western 
writers and use them as models for 
their own work," she said, adding 
that the works of Western writers 
are easier to find and more numer-
ous in Nigeria than works by 
Nigeria's own writers. 

Long, the second speaker on 
the panel , discussed the target 
audiences for print and the social 
aspects of reading. 

"When one pictures the image 
of the solitary reader, one isolates 
only a single step in the writing 
process," she said. 

By examining the images of 
women reading in paintings, Long 
noticed that women were often 
depicted in domestic settings read-
ing as a means of escapism. Men, 
on the other hand, are depicted as 
more contemplative and serious 
readers. 

However, Long added, reading 
is not an entirely isolated practice. 

"When reading is seen as a soli-
tary act, it neglects the social infra-
structure," she said. 

Reading has to be taught by 
people, she explained, and habit-
ual reading requires social rein-
forcement. In addition, "social in-
stitutions influence what society 
perceives to be worth reading, and 
other literary values." 

Long also noted that reading 
groups have been historically 
imponant, by "helping to create 
collective memory and a feeling of 
community aidi ng in cultural dis-
semination. " 

Williams spoke about the trials 
she experienced in trying 10 get her 
works published and in the devel-
opment of her writing style. She 

became a teacher"to make a living 
and write as a hobby." However, 
she found that it was possible to 
make a living from writing. 

Williams explained that she 
staned OUI writing fiction , but soon 
found that her sty le "was not what 
was expected from black writers in 
the late '60s and early '70s be-
cause it didn't get people angry 
enough." 

When her stories were rejected 
by one publisher after the other, 
Williams said she staned writing 
poetry. 

Williams summed up her expe-
rience with a quote by singer 
Smokey Robinson: "1f that doesn't 
do it then I'll try something new. " 

Later she published a volume of 
her poems, which was nominated 
for a national book award. 

"It was relatively easy in the 
'70s to get poetry published be-
cause there were so many more 
outlets for poetry than for fiction," 
she added. 

Her second volume of poetry, 
however, was never published. Her 
useof"black vernacular language" 
was seen as unbel ievable to the 
publishers. She feltthat she needed 
to "develop a new kind of diction 
more believeable to the university 
presses," but after struggling to 
develop a new diction, she found 
that she "no longer cared about 
being published by an academic 
press." She then was successfully 
publi hed by commercial presses. 

"The effort I took in trying to 
get my second volume of poetry 
published helped to clear up not 
only what genre I prefertowork in 
but also choice of voice I prefer to 
work with," she said. 

Wendy Griswold's presentation focused on the role of female 
writers in Nigeria at Friday's forum on Women in Print.

One student held a red flag 
which he said symbolized the 
aggression that causes people to 
fight against one another. This was 
what Winne was protesting, ac-
cording to the student. 

According to Howard, the A.S. 
allocated money to erect a plaque 
for Winne. However, he said, " the 
administration said 'No.' .. 

As evening fell , the number of 
those gathered around the shrine 
grew, as did the numberofcandles, 
flowers, and newspaper articles 
covering Winne's death.

named the outstanding member of 
an ROTC unit at the University of 
Colorado School of Mines in 1967 
and described his son as very sen-
sitive and gifted. 

Winne reportedly held a 2-S 
student deferment in the Selective 
Service System, which excluded 
him from military service. 

Patrick Crampton, a friend of 
Winne's for several years, told the 
Tribune that Winne said he did not 
want to be made a political martyr. 

Crampton said Winne was a 
spiritual, highly opinionated per-
son who acted on his principles, 
the Tribune reported.

LOOKING EAST 
â¢ Story by Sangccta Mehta, Guardian Reporter 

Traditionally, Romance languages have captured the 
interest of tudents wishing to gain command of a second 
language. Currently, however, the number of students 
learning the Japanese language is skyrocketing. 

In the academic year of 1983-84, 119 UCSD under-
graduates were enrolled in Japanese studies classes. This 
year's total has reached 838, and the department's pro-
jected enrollment for 1990-91 is 929 students. 

Students ofJapanesedescent are not the only ones intent 
on developing a a knowledge of Japanese language and 
culture. 

"People of all different backgrounds, majors, and ages 
are taking Japanese," said Veronica Sison, a Japanese 
studies student. 

Lecturer Masato Nishimura said the "explosion" in the 
number of students wanting to learn the language is due to 
an interest in Japan 's rapidly growing economy. 

"Japanese companies are developing in San Diego and 
all overthe U.S.," he said, "[and they] look for people who 
can peak the Japanese language." 

These companies include Sony, Mazda, Mitsubishi , 
Yamaha, Seiko, Nishin Steel Company, and Nikon. 

"The companies often find their place in rural areas of 
the U.S., particularly in the South and Midwest, and create 
many jobs," Ni himura explained. 

Noting that more Japanese bank and pecialized elec-

Committee 
Stresses 
Awareness 
Group Screens 
Political Films 
By MICHELLE MADHOK 
Guardian Reporter 

Awareness. That's what mem-
bers of the Committee for World 
Democracy say they are all about. 

For 15 years, this non-hierar-
chical committee has been striving 
to educate the UCSD student body 
about the political confrontations 
both in our own community and 
the world around u . CWO works 
on its education of the public by 
holding screenings of specially 
chosen films on Fridays at TLH 
107. 

In 1974, Cecilia Ubilla-Arenas 
arrived at UCSD as a graduate 
student and a Chilean refugee. She 
worked with other refugees to show 
films about the political turmoil in 
Chile. 

Eventually, Ubilla-Arenas said, 
these films began to appeal to other 
people. The screenings gradually 
became a weekly event, and the 
films started to cover conflicts in 
many different parts of the world. 

"We wanted to create aware-
ness of the lack of democracy in 
other countries," said Ubilla-Are-
nas. 

Today, the gro up consis ts 
mainly of five students and several 
staff members. Students SteveRus-
50S, John far Kerlee, He len 
O' Donne l, Mike Schauer, and 
Erika Stille work wi th Ubilla-Are-
nas and Byron Morton to choose 
and show the fi lms. 

Ubilla-Arenas is now the direc-
tor of the OASIS language pro-
gram and doesn't work as closely 
with the group as she used to. 
However, she has noticed some 
changes over the years. 

She said that the fiims have 
moved away from political issues 
to more personal interests. Al-
though she is very proud of what 
the committee is accomplishing 
she would " hate to see the series 
move completely away from po-
litical issues." 

She said she believes that the 
poli tical awareness on college 
campuses is very poor and that 
people need to understand the 
world around them. 

Ubilla-Arenas wants the fil ms 
to support the theory that the uni-
versity "oughtto free for all ideas." 

The films present various ideas. 
The politics of sex and racial dis-
crimination are also part of the 
committee's realm of education. 

"Wi th each week's movies 
we're attempting to addre s very 
particular constituencies, such as 
organized labor, the women 's 
movement, the gay and Ie bian 
rights community. environmental

JAPAN: UCSD Students Looking East 
Continued from page 10 
fulthan any other country now." 

"Japan is investing a lot in the 
U.S.," &aid Japanese studies stu-
dent Kevin Tachiki. "So there are 
many Japanese firms in the U.S." 

According 10 Forbes magazine, 
the United States is actually Japan's 
biggest customer. 

"We import billions of dollars 
of their good each year," Arrajj 
said, adding that "student are more 
aware of the increased hegemony 
of Japan than, say, three to four 
years ago." 

Sison said the result of Japan's 
"up-and-coming status" is that 
increasing numbers of students at 
UCSD are interested in learning 
the Japanese language. 

"Because of Japan's ties with 
the U.S. and its increased power," 
she said, "a firm command of the 
Japanese language will be impor-
tant in years to come." 

The Japanese studies depart-
ment has grown tremendously in 
recent years. 

"When I started taking Japa-
nese, there were only two sections 
to choose from. Now there's 
seven," Tachiki said. 

While UCS D currently only of-
fers a Japanese minor, Tachiki 
expects that in a few years there 
will be a Japanese major. 

The Japanese language classes 
at UCSD focus on speaking in 
add ition to reading and writing. 
Students go to class five days a 
week and learn through "educa-
tional packets" consisting of gram-
mar exercises and a textbook fi lled 
with stories. 

Unlike English, the Japanese 
language has three alphabets: Hira-
gana, Katakana, and Kanji. 

"You have to know about 2,000 
characters to read a newspaper," 
Arrajj said. " Intensive Japanese 
students learn about 900. " 

Jennifer K Olsky/GlIardian 

'Yes, Japanese is 
difficult to learn, 
but it's also a lot of 
fun and highly 
beneficial to know.' 

-Catherine Weldon 

Sison added that "we also learn 
about practical things: the customs, 
Japanese sayings, what people do 
in daily life." 

Aside from the textbook work, 
Sison said Japanese language stu-
dents take part in skits and "show 
and tell" presentations. 

In addition to the Japanese stud-
ies department's language classes, 
the Anth ropology, Economics, 
History, Political Science, and 
Sociology Departments offer 
classes focusing on Japan itself. 

Catherine Weldon, a Third 
College student, spoke highly of 
an anthropology class she is taking 
that focuses on postwar Japan. 

"It covers a lot of the popular 
culture and day-to-day events -
how they look at family, educa-
tion, leisure," she said. 

In 1988, UCS D opened the In-
ternational Relations and Paci fic 
Studies (IRPS) graduate school, 
which. Nishimura said, "teaches 
excellent courses on Japan." 

" [RPS attracts many professors 
who are well known," Tachiki said. 

Aside from providing the usual 
local newspapers, the IRPS library 
al 0 offers a number of Japane e 
newspapers. 

Students interviewed said they 
took classes in Japanese for a vari-
ety of reasons. 

"I have a friend who went to 
Japan for a year. She came back 
speaking fluently and got me inter-
ested," Sison explained. 

Weldon said she took classes 
in Japanese because she has "al-
ways been fascinated" with the 
written characters of the Japanese 
language. 

Tachiki explained that he ini-
tially started taking Japanese be-
cause he is of Japanese descent and 
wished to satisfy his general edu-
cation requirements. 

"But then my interest grew,and 
I thought I could use it as a supple-
ment when I graduate," he said. 

Tachiki said he plans to go to 
Japan after he graduates and hopes 
to either attend school or teach 
English there. 

But he is leaning towards teach-
ing "because teaching English pays 
very well and going to school in 
Japan is very expensive." 

Arrajj explained that he became 
fascinated by Japan after he re-
ceived a packet from the Educa-
tion Abroad Program (EAP) office 
during his first year at UCSD. 

The package piqued his inter-
est, and he "instantaneously" de-
cided to apply to go to Japan 
through EAP. 

Arrajj was accepted into the 
EAP program, and went to the In-
ternational Christian University in 
Mitaka, near Tokyo. He also stayed 
in Tanegawa and Tsuruda. 

Arrajj is currently hunting for a 
job with a Japanese firm and has

Interest in the Japanese culture at UCSD is increasing. "When I started taking Japanese, there were 
only two sections to choose from; now there's seven,Â· said Kevin Tachiki.

'Film Society' Examines the Flip Side of Apartheid 
By JUUE SHERMAN 
Contributing Writer 

The word "apartheid" usually 
conjures mental images of the tragedy 
and horror that afflict the black 
community in South Africa. In Jon 
Robin Baitz's play, "The Film Society," 
the playwright takes a different 
approach: Ihe way in which apartheid 
affects a group of white educators. 

Runnin g at the North Coast 
Repertory Theatre until June 2, the 
play spotlights two teachers in the 
1970s who both know that the system 
they grew up in is morally wrong. The 
performance uulizes the background 
of apartheid to discuss these conflicting 
issues. 

portrayal of Terry Sinclair, who rebels 
against the system by inviting a black 
reverend to speak at an all-white boys' 
school. When the reverend is arrested 
and later dies of a "heart attack" in his 
cell, Sinclair becomes enraged with 
the prejudice that pervade his world. 

Jonathan Balton, played brilliantly 
by Brian Salmon, is Terry's best friend 
and an instructor at the school. Yet as 
the events of the perfonnance unravel , 
we realize that Balton would never 
have the courage to stand up for what 
he knows is right. As a result, he 
immerses himself in his film society in 
ordertostay away from the controversy. 

the poignant play that won the 1989 
Dramatists' Guild Award for Best Play. 
The acting talents of Salmon are superior; 
as his character becomes more complex, 
he gets even better. When the character of 
Balton is given the chance to make changes 
in the school , he crumbles under the weight 
of any opposition, bringingto the show his 
character's tendency to back down and let 
others take action . What makes this 
perfonnance stand out is that Balton's 
innate weakness is just as much a tragedy 
as the subject of apartheid.

Blissful Eating at the Beach 
By MARIE PASTERNAK 
Sto/fWriter 

There's a place in San Diego that is a people watcher's paradise on 
any unny Sunday morning. Volleyball players, lots 0 ' neon, ro ller-
blades, transients. tourists, and tans, together creating a picture more 
action packed than any movie. These images are commonplace at the 
boardwalk in Mission Beach. The prime place to watch it all is The 
Beach House Restaurdnt. 

Of course, this is only half of the picture because dinner at The Beach 
House brings an entirely different scene. There's also a beautiful 
romantic element to be experienced when sitting on the open deck, 
feeling the fresh ocean breeze and viewing a breathtaking sunset. This 
is a perfect place for visiting parents, birthdays, dates and graduation 
dinners. 

While the evening atmosphere is elegant, it is not stuffy, and 
maintains the mood of its beach surroundings , becoming what Beach 
House owner ClydeJenkins describes as "casual elegance." This is what 
he aimed for in building his restaurant - a nice place where you don ' t 
have to get dressed up. "It 's a place where people can come and totally 
relax," l enkins said. 

The Beach House is primarily a seafood restaurant, offering fresh 
fish, stuffed shrimp, crab legs, and lobster tail , as well as beef, chicken 
and veal. Entrees come with a choice of rice or potatoes and soup or 
salad. There are also pasta dishes such as linguini with clam sauce, 
seafood fettuccine, and a special lobster pasta. The pasta is all freshly 
made at the restaurant by chef Rudolph Deitz. 

and st;rvice, but also fantastic 
scenery. 

Breakfast and lunch prices 
are a little more modest. 
Lunches, featuring burgers, 
sandwiches, soup, and seafood 
salads, range between $3 and 
$10. Brunch offers a selection 
of omelettes and a highly rec-
ommended Beach Houseorigi-
nal called "Mission Beach 
Breakfast Skins." nese are 
potato skins stuffed with 
scrambled eggs and bacon cov-
ered with melted cheese. An-
other popular item is the 
"Raisin Nut French Toast," 
made with a special bread that 
also comes with all entrees . 
Brunch prices range between 
$4 and $8. These aren't quite 

Dennys ' prices, but relaxing in the sun and watching the waves break is a lot nicer than 
being surrounded by orange and green vinyl. 

The food is fresh and of high qUality. Chef Rudolph Deitz comes insured with a 
good reputation, having once worked as a chef at New York City's world-renowned 
Tavern On The Green in Central Park.

of visits to the restaurant he makes you feel like an old friend. 
The actual Beach House building has a long history. It was built in 

the 1920 as a bath house and has gone through a succession of 
residences and restaurants. Now it appears that thelenkins' have found 
a worthwhile purpose for the old bath house; a restaurant that is a 
perfect combination of great atmosphere, food , service, and a personal 
touch that makes The Beach House is a very special place . 

The Beach House is located at 3750 Ocean Front Walk at Pismo 
Court. It you're not fa.niliar with the area, call for directions because 
from the road it's a little difficult to find. Parking is no problem, there 
is a large lot provided for Beach House patrons. There's also a bike 
rack out front, and for Sunday morning brunch this is definitely a 
preferable form of travel. 

Brunch is served daily from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m., lunch from 11 a.m. to 
3 p.m., and dinner from 4:30 to 9 p.m. (weekends until IO p.m.). The 
restaurant is closed Monday evenings. 

This entertaiment 
ranged from bands 
performing to beauty 
pageant contestants 
strutting. The festivities 
even included a group of 

Dinner prices are not cheap at The Beach House, but they are 
competitive. Entrees range between $13-$22. This is fairly reasonable 
forthis type of restaurant considering you're getting not only good food 

Service at the Beach House is very good, perhaps a result of the continuous pres-
ence of restaurant owners Clyde and Linda Jenkins. Jenkins claimed that, "When you 
walk into that door it's like you 're walking into my home." This is certainly not an 
exaggeration. Arriving at 5 a.m. Clyde Jenkins spends about 17 hours a day at his 
restaurant making sure that it's being run the way he wants and that his guests are 
treated right. Much of that time is spent meeting with, and talking to his patrons. A 
friendly man, Jenkins remembers people by their first name, and after only a couple

FILMS 
Continued from page 10 
activists; and a gamut of progres-
sive concerns," commillee mem-
ber Byron Morton said. " We see a 
dearth of access to information." 

This year CWD showed a film 
on Harvey Milk, the first openly 
gay man to be elected to a major 
U.S. office. 

The group also showed "I Claim 
Myself: The Sagon Penn Incident" 
as an example of racial discrimina-
tion within the San Diego commu-
nity. 

The Committee for World 
Democracy considers itself a dif-
ferent source of information on the 
issues. 

Kerlee said, "we're an alterna-
tive to the mainstream." He said 
most people "assume that the 
United States is at the peak. of 
democracy. Wedon't believe we're 
there by any means." 

In CWD's view, the popular 
media shows only one side of the 
story. The committee said it wants 
to educate people about the parts 
of the story that the media does not 
show. 

Kerlee describes the committee 
as "progressive to the left, but not 
exclusive of anybody ... We are 
open to new ideas." 

And despite political leanings, 

'We try to sh-ow 
films that educate, 
but also entertain .' 

- Johnfar Kerlee, member, 
Committee for 
w~ Democracy 

Kerlee said the group tries to give 
an alternative view than what the 
mainstream media shows. 

"We try to show films that 
educate, but also entertain," he 
added. 

He said people were "shocked" 
at the screening of a film about 
lesbians. The committee even re-
ceived 'hate mail for a Pro-Pales-
tinian film. 

"If we just get people to see that 
this is educational work," said 
Ubilla-Arenas, "then the emotions 
will cool down and people can get 
together and discuss the issues." 

The films are chosen from the 
distributor catalogs, audience sug-
gestions, and critic's reviews. The 
group picks issues they feel are 
important. 

They look for quality films that 
may not necessarily be popular. 
The committee then narrows its 
choices down to 12 for the quaner. 

"People who are concerned 
with the overall climate of the 
campus and who could use more 
education should join us," said 
Ubilla-Arenas. 

"Power without education is a 
very dangerous thing." added 
Ubilla-Arenas. "Young people of 
today have a lot of power, and it is 
frigh tening to know that these 
people will be leaders when they 
are so uninformed and ignorant 
about the rest of the world."

PHIL'S ANALYSIS ... Down 3-1 to Phoenix, the odds are unquestiunably against the 
Lakers as they attempt to come back in the playoffs. But wait a second. These are the 
Lakers we're talking about. The Lakers. The Lakers do not lose to Phoenix. They just 
don't. They do not lose, period. And now they're returning home, to put this series back 
into perspective and show the Suns that they have no busine s thinking they can beat 
one of the greatest teams in the history of basketball. Check that. One of the greatest 
teams in the hi tory of sport. Period. The Lakers just wanted to get the Suns excited-
to let them get a lead. And now they will crush them. Easily. PHIL says ...

Track and Field Crams 
For Marks at Occidental 
Last Chance to Qualify Adds Three More to Nationals 

By TOM RIZZUTI 
taffWriter 

While mo t of us won't be cramming for final until 
a few weeks from now, the UCSD track team did a little 
cramming of it own on Saturday. 

The Tritons traveled up to the Occidental College 
Invitational knowing the meet would be their last chance 
to qualify athletes for next week's National competi-
tion. They re ponded with three new qualifiers, as three 
chQol records fell on the afternoon. 

women' 4x 100 meters relay team. In what would have 
been its last meet, the team of Yvette Marzullo, Erica 
Washington, Vicky Dunckley, and Michelle Milledge 
recorded a time of 40.83, which not only broke a school 
record, but came out well under the national qualifying 
mark. 

In addition to her uccess in the relay, Washington, 
who had already qualified in the 100m, posted a time of 
25.28 in the 200m to qualify in that event. 

She finished second in both events on Saturday. 
In the women's field events, the Tritons were led by 

Shannon Quigley 's third place finish in the discus.

The Triton national qualifier list soared to 14 Saturday at Oxy. 

It wa a day in which Triton Head Coach Mark 
Stanforth aw "several good things" happen. 

The highlight of the day was the performance by the

Postseason Outlook is Gloomy 
Baseball Picture Clouds When West Regional Selection Committee Recommends 
to National Committee That UCSD Be Denied a Bid to Division III Playoffs 

By PETER KO 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD baseball team received ex-
actly the opposite of a vote of confidence 
when it was revealed yesterday that the 
West Regional Selection Committee had 
recommended to the National Selection 
Committee on Thursday that the Tritons not 
be offered a bid to the Regional Champion-
ships, sour<;es aid. 

Sources added that the Regional Com-
mittee had recommended CSU San Bernar-
dino and Claremont for the two openings. 

No official confirmation had been re-
ceived as of late yesterday from the National 
Committee. 

All hope for UCSD Head Coach Lyle 
Yate and his team, however, is not lost. 

Last season, the Regional Selection 
Committee made the same recommenda-
tion to the National Selection Committee: 
that CSU San Bernardino and CSU Stanis-
laus be offered bids, and the Tritons be 
denied one. 

The National Committee overruled the 
Regional decision, however, and the Tritons 
faced CSUS while CSUSB tayed home. 

Sources noted that the chances of last 
year's overruling happening again does not 
eem likely, since CSUSB does not have a 

playing facility available and the host team 
would have to be notified early. 

The news come one week after the West 

Regional Committee decided to delay a final 
decision until the Tritons completed their 
regular season schedule with a road contest 
against CSU Dominguez Hills and a home 
game against San Diego State. 

The Tritons defeated CSUDH, 4-0, but 
fell to SDSU 10-2. 

Before the SDSU game, Yates had aid 
that the only advice the committee had given 
him was: Play well in your final two game . 

UCSD was in contention with CSU San 
Bernardino, La Verne, and Claremont for a 
regional pot. 

According to Yates, CSUSB was virtu-
ally a lock for one spot, leaving the other 
three teams to scramble for the one remain-
ing opening. 

5-1 Loss Marks 
Third Straight Year 
UCSD Has Fallen 
In the First Round 

SWARTHMORE, PA - If only the 
Division ill National Tournament did 
not have a first round. 

This might seem just a bit illogical, 
but to the eighth-seeded UCSD men's 
tennis team, it probably sounds like a 
capital idea. 

Yesterday' s 5~ 1 opening round loss 
to DePauw extends the Tritons' tourna-
ment O-for-first-round streak to three 
years , and kept them winless in openers 
under Head Coach Jon Hammermeister. 

Tim Ditzler pulled off the only Triton 
victory, a 6-1 6-1 cakewalk through 
DePauw's Kyle Gamble at number five. 

Other individual match scores were 
unavailable at press time. 

UCSD faces St. John 's tomorrow in 
the consolation bracket, where a seventh 
place finish is the best UCSD can achieve 
after taking sixth last year.

â¢ EDITOR'S NOTE 

At preIS time, the results or the 
women's match were unavailable. 

UCSD Head Coach Lyle Yates hopes 
that last season's lightning strikes again.
