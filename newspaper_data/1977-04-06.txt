If President Saxon approves the revised 
plan for the development fA the University 
of California libraries this June it will mark 
a new page in the operation of the UC librarx 
system-a page not to the liking of many. 

UC Ubrarj Plan Altered--
Stili Unacceptable to Many 

such a way as to not need the facilities , then 
that's fine by us." 

Salmon stated that the changes proposed 
are " necessary." " The UC system adds 
600,000 books a year," he said. "That's about 
equivalent to a Santa Cruz or Irvine 
Library. THat's every year. Those books will 
need shelving somewhere as space becomes 
more and more critical in the libraries. 
Already you see the difficulties libraries 
have in getting funding. This ( the 
warehouses) is a viable solution." 

"While the revised plan is an im-
provement over the initial plan, it stiU 
retains features that I believe do not 
eliminate the central problems created in 
the first," stated Andrew Wright, Chainnan 
of the systemwide University Library 
Committee and UCSD literature professor. 

Revisions Seen as Improvements but UCSD 
Believes Iln.ment StDNS Lack of Research 
Wright: '\ViII)) My Best to 5tq) PIal" Noting that the new library plan is ex-pected to save some $35 million over the 

next 10 years, Salmon claimed that many of 
the plans positive features are overlooked 
by critics. "We're trying to make the best 
possible plan out of the situation and 
limitations that face us," he said. " It 's been 
made clear by the state that we won't be 
able to build new library facilities as in the 
past. Under our proposal things won't be 
that much different-indeed, they're sup-
posed to be better ... 

Wright's doubts extend primarily to the 
two large regional facilities located in the 
north and south (probably at Los Angeles 
and Berkeley), which are expected to 
eventually house a total of 10 million books. 
"There are all sorts of problems inherent in 
such a situation," said Wright. " The loss of 
books will mean the debilitation of campus 
libraries. You will also find a decline in 
scholarly research. Catalogs are often not 
the only means of research, and sometimes 
it is only by roaming the stacks of books that 
one comes upon relevant subject matter." 

Wright noted that the revised plan does 
allow for " browsing in the storage 
facilities," but stated that the manner in 
which it could be done was '~still up in the 
air." Stressing a strong local library, 
Wright said that the transportation of large 
amounts of material from the storage 
facilities would "not be adequate." 

Queliltions Remain In Plan 
Better or not , many features of the plan 

have not been solidified. The method of 
tral13porting the books from the proposed 

c: regional centers has not been resolved, with 
~ Salmon claiming he believes that something ~ to the effect of a "jitney bus system" would 
.'a be used. Additionally, the amount of time 6 taken for deliveries remains questionable. 
" When asked whether he believes the new t library system would in effect creatt'dl " new 
1= bureaucracy," Salmon replied, ,·t hope 

Reiterating a wish voiced by many, that 
important matters should be done "little by 
little instead of in great gulps," Wright 
noted that "Salmon (Steven Salmon-
Executive Director of Library Planning and 
author of the UC Libraries development 
plan) seems to have done OJ) research on 
what other great libraries have done." 
Wright further specified that nowhere in 
Salmon's document could it be found that 
"nine smaller facilities might do as well as 
two large ones-and cost no more . II 

plan would build up the UC library system 
as a whole "by opening up the resources of 
aU the libraries to faculty and students." He 
said that with the institution of the plan the 
various libraries might find " access to 15 

. million books instead of a milllon and a 
haH," thus coming to " realize all the ad-
vantages to study and research."

not." He said he believes that matters ,and 
changes could be worked out " by the 
existing positions in the existing 
bureaucracy." 

Also of major concern, " the depletion of 
books from individual campuses," he sees 
as not beginning until the mid 1980s. and 
even then " negligible." " For example," 
'Salmon said, "the 25 percent figure of books 
taken for UCSD would be a long time in the 
future, and again, such a figure would be up 
to your campus." 

Greater Access of Materials 
Salmon on the 'other hand believes the 

Admitting that the revised plan (sub-
mitted March 3) was better than the initial 
one, Salmon said it had "substantially 
benefited by the comments." He pointed out 
that now the "planning ahead" in the report 

" We believe in the importance of strong 
campus libraries ," said Salmon. "This is 
one of the reasons why the amount of 
materials to be stored in the regional cen-
ters has been substantially lowered. Fur-
ther, we' re not telling the campuses what to 
do. If they can solve their space problems in

Dripping Faucet HOne QfThose Things" 

by Scott SadU 
Associate News Editor 

Dribbledribbledribble ... 
Let's see, less than ten minutes 

for the cup to overflow, that's 
about one-half gallon an hour, so 12 
gallons a day, 360 gallons a month, 
for six months, at a rate-of about a 
penny every ten gallons, divide, 
multiply, carry the two ... 

And -OUCH! - the water is hot. 
The governor had better not see 

this. 
Steady Leak 

In September of last year 
students moving onto the ninth 
floor of Tioga Hall discovered a 
steady flow of hot water leaking 
from the faucet in the washin~ 
machine room sink. 

Concerned about water and 
energy conservation, the students 
follo,!ed normal dormitory 

Money 
Money is available to a 

qualified student who has some 
a rtistic or creative ability, and 
would like a job laying out Triton 
Times advertising. . 

An experienced work-study 
student would be perfect, but a 
non-experienced person could be 
trained. The job will entail about 
two hours of work three times per 
week. 

Applicants should see Gary 
or Dave at the Triton Times fA·

maintenance procedures, notifying 
a maid about the faulty plwnblng, 
who, ih turn, contacted the student 
housing maintenance crew. 

~A month passed and water was 
still dribbling out of the faucet. The 
concerned students took more 
direct action , going personally to 
the maintenance office and filling 
out a work-order fonn requesting 
repair of the faucet. . 

Presently, six months after the 
leak was first found, the steady 
trickle of water continues 
unabated. 

"We Know AboutTbat Faucet" 
"We know about that faucet," 

said Muir Resident Hall Ma!1ager 
John Odjik Monday when 
questioned about the extended 
delay in repairing the washroom 
plumbing. "New valves are 
needed. We've ordered the parts, 
but they just haven't come in yet. " 

Odjik, who directs the main-
tenance for student housing on the 
Muir campus, voiced foncern 
about Chis and other water and 
energy wastes in donnitories and 
apartments. "We're trying to 
conserve energy just like everyone 
else. We do everything we can to 
fix this sort of problem. This has 
just been one of those things." 

So the dribble goes on and on. 
Crude calculations estimate the 

loss of water at over two thousand 
gallons for the past six months . 
That amount would not even meet 
the toilet flushing demands for an 
average day at Tioga Hall. In 
tenns of dollars, the loss would 
barely be enough to cover the cost 
of a couple of packages of rubber 
washers. 

But if the governor saw such 
waste ... 

ASUCSD Nominations Open: 
Funding is Still Up in the Air 

by Laura Richter 
Staff Writer 

The question of how to fund the 
ASUCSD and individual college 
council elections scheduled to be 
held during the third week of this 
quarter, is still under debate by the 
interim student government 
Transition Team. 

"As far as I know, we're 
funding it from over-enrollment 
funds, since we're over-enrolled, 
as usual," said Ann Carberry, 
Transition Team member. " If not, 
the money will probably come 
from the $10,000 Student Activity 
Fee (SAF) reserve." 

The Advisory Committee for 
Student Fee Programs has 
reportedly suggested SAF support 
for the upcoming elections, George 
Murphy, Vice<hancellor and Dean 
of Student Mfa irs, stated this 
"proposed invasion of Campus 
Activity Fee reserves.. . would be 
in direct violation of the guidelines 
so recently put into place." He 
declined to make a decision as tt 
the el cHon budgeting, saying that 
"We should know whether the 
problem is imaginary or real by 
mid-April. " 

"Some people feel it's not th 
proper funding source, II said 
Transition tedm member Betsy 
Miller referring to the possibl i SAF funding. She feel " that the 

eli reserve will be used up this ear

which are available at EDNA and 
each of the colleges. Applications 
for college council offices will also 
be available at the respective 
colleges. Rules limiting the 
number of offices for which a

HEW Gets ''Tough'' on Dscri mination 
(CPS)-Less than half of the school 
districts and colleges which are 
obliged to meet requirements 
preventing sex discrimination 
under Title IX 1>f the 1972 
Education Amendments have 
submitted the necessary assurance 
statements, says the Department 
of Health, Education and Welfare's 
Office of Civil Rights (OCR). There 
are 20,318 Institutions that must file 
compliance forms and by March 
17, 1976 only 6,742 had submitted 
aceepta ble statements . 

Joseph Califano, HEW 
Secretary, has instituted a " get 
tough" policy which win give the 
school systems and colleges that 
did not file assurance forms or 
filed unacceptable reports 60 days 
to assure the government they are 
complying with the regulation or 
face possible withdrawal of 
Federal funds . An OCR spokesman 
said, however, that it takes about 
nine months to process a cutoff of 
funds from the Federal govern-
ment 50 it is not likely that any 
denial of money would take effect 
during the current school year. 

Higher Education Dally, an 
independent news service for 
higher education administrators , 
reported that a total of 3,222 school 
districts and colleges sent in 
unacceptable statements while 
10 ,354 failed to s ubmit any 
statements at all . All schools 
receiving Federal aid are required 
to enter compliance forms to HEW 
and were notified in July 1976 that 

the forms were to have been 
submitted originally by Sept. 30, 
1976. 

Since Califano's "get lough" 
announcement in February, the 
agency has been receiving about 
six 'forms a day. The 3,222 unac-
ceptable forms submitted failed to 
establish grievance procedures, 
appoint an equal opportunity of-
fi cer 0 1' conduct a self-eva lua tion of 
programs and policies that might 
violate the legal requirements of 
Title IX. 

In a further attempt to deal with 
the hi gh level of poor or 
nonexistent response to the Title 
IX regulations. the OCR has 
revised the Title IX compliance 
form which will be mailed to 
schools and collegeS next month. 
The new form resembles the 
former compliance sheet in every 
way except for the elimination of 
compliance with Title IX from 
subgrllntees. contractors or 
s ubcontractors . Instead, says 
HEW, the Federal aid recipients 
can check up those employes on 
their own. 

Title IX provides that " no person 
shall , on the basis of sex, be ex-
cluded from participation in, be 
denied the benefits of or be sub-
jected to disc rimination under any 
education program or activity 
receiving Federal financial 
assistance." And in order to keep 
tabs on the progress of its 
regulations and its money, the 
OCR asks the following questions

-What type of institution is sub-

can mean anything from a state

or a person, organization or group ' 
not primarily engaged in 
education.

CaIPIRG Urges Reform 
Of Steri lization Abuse 

By Ha ..... S ..... 

Members of the caUfornia Public Interest Research Grot!P (C.alPJRG) 
and several uam medical students recently 'testified In1.os An~ele!l, 
supporting proposed caUfornia regulations which would. saff'guanl full 
informed conaent for sterilization operations. These proposed ~ulations 
are aimed at curbiDg the climbing rate of sterilization abuse. 

Sterilization abuse occurs when prospective patients are not told that 
sterilization is pennanent. Sometimes they are pre!l.'Itln-d to !!I~n con-
sent' forms while in labor, IUlder sedation, or shortly before or after an-
abortion. other times they are threatened with the lollS of wE'lfare 
benefits or with deportation to force consent to sterilization . 

The suggested guidelines woold require: . 
-that adequate infonnation and colUlseling be provided to sterili7.ation 
patients so that they can understand all possible costs, ilf'lM'nt'l. ri!!ks and 
results of the operation, as wen as alternative methods of birth coritrol 
-that this information be provided in the patient's own lan~ua~e, dearly 
stated in a bookletfonnat 
-that there be 8 14 day waiting period between the time of sl~d con!lent 
and the time of the sterilization. 

Minority groups and welfare recipients are most often hurt y the 
current sterilization practices. "Many of the patients are minority 
women," said Claire Lipschultz, co-director of the San J)iego balled 
CaIPIRG. " In fact, 10.7 percent of minority women on welfare are 
sterilized compared with 8.7 percent of white women not on welfare. " 

In "1973, bills were introduced in (ive state legislature!! to require 
welfare recipients to submit to sterilization, although none of them 
passed. The prop'osed regulations are meant to safeguard these peoplE' 
against the attitude that they must be sterilized because of thl'ir 
"inability" to make good choices about family planning. At thl' I.A 
hearings on the regulations last month, a Olerokee-Oloctaw womlln 
doctor, commenting on current practices, on Indian Reservation!l 
proc laimed: "This is genocide." 

Informed consent(which would be protected by the rl'~ullltions) is 
defined as the voluntary, knowing assent from the individulli on whom 
sterilization is ~rformed after she or he has been given information 
about the procedures, risks, benefits and alternative ml'thods of fllmily 
planning. 

Eleven chicana women are currently bringing II I<lW suit IIgllinst 
doctors at the Women's Hospital in USC medical crntcr.lllll'ging thllt thl' 
doctors violated their right to infomled con'sent. In lin IIffidllvlt rClld <II 
last month's hearings, one woman claimed that a doctor IlpprOllC'hC'd hpr 
during labor and repeatedly asked her questions about her nlltionlllity 
and-economic status. , 

The doctor, the affidavit goes on, then pressro thp womlln, slIying 
"How can you feed, clothe and take care of more children? Do you wllnt II 
sterilization?" The woman agreed to sterilization, but only if the soon-to-
be-born child was a boy. 

Several weeks later. after the woman gave birth to a girl, the womlln 
was informed that she had already been steriJizro. Or. Rl'rnllrd 
Rosenfeld, a resident at the USC medical center, has verified this ~tory. 

According to a recent CalPIRG study, 13 of 14 San Diego hospitlll!l givp

no literature on sterilization to 
patients considering sterilization. 
CaIPIRG also found that 13 of 14 
hospitals provided no Counseling 
services to patients. 

Tbe only source of infonnation 
and advice about sterilization Is 
the patlert's physician. Twelve of 
14 hospitals required no waiting 
period between signed consent and 
sterilization. In half the hospitals, 
the calPIRG study reports, con-
scnt forms were available in 
English only. 

The California Medical 
Association (CMA) testified t .. t 
the proposed regulations will 
create a nuisance, another cum-
bersome governmental intrusion. 
The ftexibiUty of tbe present 
doctor-patient relationship, they 
say, would be constricted by the 
establishment of mandated 
procedUre!!. 

The CMA argued that the 
regulations would be too costly to 
implement. and create excessive 
demand on doctors' time. Full 
disclosure of the possible effects 0( 
sterilization would not be a~ 
propriate, they said; the women 
involved would not satisfactorily 
understand the risks and c0m-
plications.

ContIDued from Pag~ 1 

Librarian Millicent Abell stated 
that, "For a conection that's been 
as carefully built as ours, 25 per-
cent is not an acceptable figure." 

Abell expressed her approval of 
some of the improvements In the 
revised plan, but nonetheless was 
disappointed from what she term-
ed a "lack of ftexibiUty." "They 
neither seem willing to modify or 
experiment," said Abell. "I'm 
convinced that the best kind of 
library plan is one built on 
carefully thought out plans for 
each campus, and clearly that has 
not been done." 

Future Pro"elDl Foretold 
Abell also had serious concerns 

over acceptance of the plan in its 
current fonn because of the 
"po!lsible future occurrences." "I 
believe if the plan is accepted in its 
current form it will cause 
problems for the entire Univer-
sity," she said. "Technology is 
changing too quickly to take steps 
as dramatic as the ones con-
sidered. Options should be left open 
at any event." 

Challenging the projected 
savings figures, Abell said, "I 
don't think there has been a careful 
enough analysis of costs. Some of 
the proposals might result in 
considerable more expense, which 
could cause serious problems in 
funding ." 

The Library Steering Committee 
is expected to have their final 

Finally, they opposed a waiting 
period by arguing that the patient's 
free will would be undermined 
since those who desire an im-
mediate sterilization would have to 
wait two weeks. 

On the other hand, CalPIRG 
supports the regulations. 
Sterilization is a permanent, 
irreversible operation, they argue, 
and should be considered with 
much deliberation and full In-
formation. 

"Under the present system, 
consent forms are signed which 
are not understood, decisions are 
made without discussion about the 
results and risks of the operation 
and alternative metoom of birth 
control, and there is no system of 
accounta bility for the procedures 
performed. In order to protect 
women and men from the loss of a 
very essential right, that of 
reproductive freedom, there must 
be a mechanism to emure that this 
right is not violated," said Lit>' 
schultz. 

CaIPIRG believes that the 
additional costs of doctors' and 
patients' time, and possible in-
creased medical costs are worth it. 
"If sterilization abuse were a rare 
and isolated phenomenon," 

decisions and recommendation in 
by May 23, something Salmon sees 
necessary "to get money for the 
next fiscal year." From there tile 
plan would be taken to President 
Saxon for perusal, with a June 
decision from him expected. 

In the meantime the controversy 
rages on, with many others 
echoing Andrew Wright's v(1W of, 
"I will do my best to stop such a 
plan."

Hevy Face for Aim Cass 
by Debbie Schwartl 

~ Staff Writer Some of us f freaks who signed up for Manny Farber's Director class quarter may have been surprised this week to find a 
stranger caurng out the nameS from the new class roster. As most of 11'1 
may know by now, his name is Jonathan Rosenbaum. But that's about 
all we know about him. Who is this person we will trust to enhance our 
understanding of that celluloid reality that has become so much a fIIIrt 
of our lives? 

In a recent interview, Rosenbaum discussed his home liff' In 
Alabama, where hiS aesthetic interests and enthusiasm for films grE'W 

he did in a home desi8ned by Frank Lloyd Wright. His family 's movie 
1th4 ... t •• r business prOVided him with unlimited viewing privill'ges. 
I Nlrti"I1I",rlv of 50s Hollywood movies. 

After graduating from a prep school in Vermont, Rosenbaum went 
to attend New York University and then Bard College, where he 

his BA in English. He furthered his education at State 
University of New York at Stonybrook, where he taught for a year aftl'r 
attaining an MA in English. 

For the past seven years, Rosenbaum has been surveying the 
European film world. He worked as a staff writer for Sight and SGund 

a.nd was assistant editor for Monthly Film BulIetID, a 
... 6" ..... ',. put out by the British Film Institute. He has also contributed 

1"r'til'l .. ~ to Film Comment and Village Voice. 
Rosenbaum voiced some interestmg ideas concerning the role of film 

criticism. He feels that " there are different roles for diffl'rl'nt critic's." 
His own critiQues attempt to "evaluate the film, situate it in history aml 
convey subjective impressions." He expressed interes t in stu 
" things that go into believing in a movie" and "things that make you 
aware of watching it." 

In the Director Series class, Rosenbaum will be emphasizing the 
phenomenon of viewer partiCipation in films and " how people use and 
are used by movies." By developing interpretational skills, such as 
directing attention to certain aspects of a film, he hopes to enCOl1ragl' 
viewers to take a more active and creative viewing role. 

Rosenbaum will also be teaching a Monday evening Criticism class.

Young Artist Opera Theater: 
Approaches to Comic Opera 

Nineteenth Century composer 
Oooizetti's comic skill and talent in

Thomas Nee, under the auspices of

is a strong willed attractive girl 
loved by Daniel , a gentle hero. 
Village pranksters have written a 
letter to Daniel in Betly's name 
accepting his offer of marriage. 
When the elated lover arrives at 
Betly's chalet , she denies 
koowledge of the letter, claiming 
that she much prefers her in-
dependence .

and help Daniel's cause. His ' 
scheme of turning soldiers lose in

as part absurdist, part satiric, part 
simple comedy, is a novel piece of 
many sides, that can be played in 
many ways. 

or only four notes, ins one of 
the few operas written for the 
accompaniment of a piano instead 
of an orchestra, thereby 
eliminating the usual bleakness of 
operas written for a symphony

The Four Note Opera, a satire 
poking fun at traditional opera, has 
been produced in five languages, in 

. Amsterdam, Tokyo, Hanover, 
Camera Three, CBS, and more 
than 20 college campuses.

Rundgren's JlRa": Good Music 
And Awful Lyrics Combined 

by Ted Navin Burke 
Staf' Writer 

Ra - Todd Rundgren/utopla 
[BearsvUle] 

Todd Rundgren is one of those 
aggravating rock whiz kids who 
can dually amaze you with his 
music and make you ill with his 
lyrics, which carry tile theme of 
cosmic conciousness and hayseed 
mysticism to more pompous 
degrees than even Yes ' Joe 
Anderson. 

Ra, his new effort with his 
sometimes band, Utopia, continues 
the Hundgren formula of good 
music with awful lyrics. When 
matters here cook is when the 
words are shoved to the wayside 
and the band (Roger Powell , KisiITI 
Sulton, John Wilcox) proceeds 
towards some charging, frenetic, 
deliciously cl~ver music. But 
Rundgren, like . Tull's Ian 

Anderson, allows the lyrics at 
points to have equal billing, most 
notable on side two's magnum opus 
"Singring and The Glass Guitar." 

It 's an extensive parable that 
breaks up the music, and which is 
belabored at length in the 
narrative to make sure everyone 
gets the point Everytime the band 
begins something interesting or 
when Rundgren is doing an im-
pressive guitar exposition, the 
recited lyrics intrude again, and so 
on . 

Either Rundgren considers 
himself a wise fablist, or he just 
employs this dreck to kill time, 
fleshing out and lending continuity 
to passages he couldn't otherwise 
connect. The diseerning 'Rundgren 
fan will throwaway the lyric sheet 
and let the music mitigate the 
intellectual vacuity. Taking his 
world view seriously is like reading 
between the lines on a blank page.

Flowers in San Diego

Anoclate Newl Editor 

The grea ropean Renaissance.tlonlll1slm-me!tel 
initiated tural rebirth of the _',~~Q""" 

of the song and sends the listener into 
the fantasy world of con-

But the group could not be

taken aback by the apparent con-
temptuousness, when a modern 
musical group boldly adopts a name 
of such historical significance. 

But not so with this British quintet 
of highly talented musicians_ 

Renaissance can't be classified 
lUlder the simplistic terms of rock or 
jazz ; their music blends modern with 
traditional, rock with classical , jazz 
with opera-into an exquisitely refined 
sound which is uniquely Renaissance. 
And a San Diego audience proved the 
growing popularity of Renaissance's 
refres hing sensitivity to a variety 
musical forms last week, when 
appeared in concert at Golden 

Renaissance captivated the

amalgam, the group has an unusual 
arrangement for producing their 
compositions. Michael Dunford 
composes the melodies and sends the 
sheet music off to 'Cornish poet, Betty 
Thatcher, who writes the lyrics. 

Renaissance already has been well-
received on· the East Coast and in 
Europe , and is now trying to boost 
their exposure on the West Coast. 
Plagued by poor management and 
advertising agencies in the past, 
members of the group expressed their 
concern for their West Coast image. 

"We've spent a great deal oftime on 
the East Coast," composer Michael 
Dunford said in an interview before 
the San Diego show. "It's just a 
matter of spending more time here . I 
don't think it's easy to get air play 
here." 

When asked about the origins of 
using classical Russian themes, in 
particular, a song from one album 
which empathizes for the plight of 
dissident Russian artist Alexander 
Solzhe nitsyn, Dunford claims no 
premeditation : " There wasn' t any 
conscious effort," he said, adding "we 
all like Russian composers. It's just a 
natural evolvement; we don't plan it 
out, we take it as it comes as we are 
writing and arranging." 

And in regard to the comt>osition, 
titled " Mother Russia," from Tum of 
the Cards, DWlford said : " That 
particular song seemed to faU 
together becaus~ I wrote the melody 
of the song the same time Betty 
finished Solzhenitsyn's books." 

But the latest achievement in 
musical ilmovation is Novell., and 
bassist Jon Camp explained that "the 
prime concern with Novella was to 
broaden our musical outlook and 
recording spectrum." And whichever 
direction Renaissance takes, they're 
bound to amaze audiences with an 
uncompromising mixture of sound, 
emotion and an incomparable mood.

WOO'II FOct The Bill ? 
Divorce Means Problems m Qlmpus Rnance 

(CPS)-As divorce ~tes skyrocket 
nationwide, many college students 
are finding their educational 
futures bounced between two 
sparring partners, neither of whom 
wants custody of the bIltion bill. 

If both parents can't pay, or 
else refWle to pay, many students 
lum to Uncle Sam for a helping 
hand-and ~ive Me. The federal 
and state tuition assistance 
programs dole out money 00 the 
basis of the Income of the parent 
who has CUBtody. TbIs is usually 
the mother. 

For Instance, a student at the 
University of Colorado applied for 
financial assistance on the basis of 
her mother's income which was 
less than $1,000 and received help. 
The girl's father, who earned close 
to $36.000 a ,year contributed 'only 
alimony and child support. 

" We can't seek out all fathers 
Involved in divorces and make 
them pay their share, " Slid a 
spokesman for the department of 
Health, Education and Welfare 
(HEW). "We depend on the courts 
to determine who pays what, when 
and to whom," he added. 

The question of which parents 
pays the tuition isn't usually 
resolved as divorce lawyers

Federal rules and regulations 

make the question of educational 
responsibility clear-cut by placing 
it on the shoulders of the parent 
who retains. \egal clL1tody. The 
rules and reguJatioos rely on 
twisted logic, however, since no 
mechanism allows for the father's 
actual salary or for the collection 
from the father. 

Private institutions, 00 the other 
hand, approach the problem more 
directly. "It becomes a markedly 
larger question each year simply 
because of the higher proportion of 
parents separating and divor-
cing," Kenneth Ostberg, director 
of. financial aid for Columbia 
College, observed. 

When a parent is reluctant to 

for run-offs, they will be held Tues. 
and Wed. of the fifth week· of the 
quarter. 

Campaign rules include a $50 
limit on a single candidate's ex-
penditures, with " a detailed ac-
counting of all expenditures" to be 
turned in to EDNA by Apr. 22. One 
person may be specified as 
campaign manager, and may also 
have control over campaign 
spending. The guidelines state that 
"any deviation from the rules 
stated above, either by the can-
didate or by hislher campaign 
workers may result in the 
disqualification of the candidate."

there is a genuine fear behind the 
actioo. Courts tend to see money in

enough money to pay a $3,000 to 
14,000 tuWon bill, the judge may 
see fit to .. t him up for a fatter 
alimony payment or Increased 
child support payment. 

On the otI.1er hand, lf the 
mother can provide the cash, the 
court may Interpret her action as 
meaning that she can get by on less 
alimony or support.

PrIvate coDeges assume that If 

the natural parents lire capable of 
paying a decent proportion of the 
college costs, they will. 

"We can't just determine the

making only '10,000 a year when 
the student's father may be ear· 
ning $40,000. You have to see each 
situation individually," one 
financial aid officer explained. 

Often finance offices find 
themselves trying to untangle 
complicated legal situations that 
usually involve another hoWlehold 
and perhaps a third and fourth 
SpoWle. 

" You have to tread lightly," 
another flJlaocial aid officer noted. 

Be the school public or private, 
all financial aid officers agree that 
divorce has made the goal of a 
college education more difficult for 
students to achieve. 

"Increased financial stress 
makes many students more 
resolved to get their educatioN!," 
observed TOOl Husted of the 
University of Colorado financial
