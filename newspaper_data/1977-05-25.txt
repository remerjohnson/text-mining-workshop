Soviet Dissident Speaks at Seminar Here 
nCom~unist Countries Deny Human Rights" 

by Jobn Compton 
StaHWrlter 

The human rights of individuals 
living in Communist countries 
today are almost totally denied, a 
Soviet dissident said here Monday 
at a seminar on human rights. 

Vladislav Krasnov, now a 
Professor at Southern Methodist 
University, defected from the 
USSR in the 60s and said that 
although the USSR's constitution 
contains many of the rights 
established by the United Nations 
in the Universal Declaration of 
Rights of 1948, "All of these rights 
are totally or severely denied by 
the Communist state." 

All rights, Krasnov continued, 
established by the UN, are seen 
through Marxist-Leninist ideology, 
so a person may have educational 
goals and career aspirations, but 
only if they are in accord with the 
ideology and wishes of the Com-
munist state. 

recognition. We've been helping 
our enemy never standing up to 
and questioning the motives of the 
Soviets," she said. 

Marvin Olasky, one-time 
Communist party member, 
believes the USSR has attempted 
to co-exist in peace with the US 
long enough to obtain much needed 
agricultural aid and advanced 
technology . 

on the far right and far left of the 
political spectrwn have strong 
feelings for man's fundamental 
rights." 

A point of concern of many 
members of the audience was what 
could they do to improve and in-
sure universal human rights.

Human Experiments· to 
Be Limited Under Bill 

by Laura Richter 
. Staff Writer 

Consent forms, to be signed by human experimental patients, will be 
required to warn of any possible or predicted side effects, pending 
passage of Assembly. Bill 1752. 

The Institute for Study of . Medical Ethics (ISME), promoters ofthe bill, 
reported that out of the 16,000 Californians who undergo experimentation 
each year, 82 percent give an incomplete consent and they are left 
unaware of possible consequences. 

ISME has compiled affidavits which document cases of permanent 
physical damage among the human subjects, sometimes resulting in 
sterilization or paralysis. They also cite instances in which patients were 
released from the experiment and were later denied treatment for 
lingering ailments. 

The non-profit organization of volunteer doctors, lawyers and laypeople 
has spent two and a half years researching and interviewing individuals 
who have suffered physical damage from hazardous and unsafe medical 
experiments. There is no present legislation which protects people from 
doctors who " lie, mislead or falsely represent their intentions or the 
experiments' known side effects, history or potential dangers," ac-
cording to ISME. 

ISME volunteer, Tom Lane, felt that "it's just a basic human right to 
know what's going to happen to one's cody," and often a patient is in-
competent to know what is being signed because of its level of ter-
minology. Lane spoke of incidents where the individual was actually 
drugged before being asked to consent, therefore making him 
irresponsible for his actions. 
. ISME quoted Dr. Gershon Hepner, who opposes the bill, as saying 
"When you have an MD, it gives you certain rights, and I'm not sure that 
a law wouldn 't infringe on the trust between doctor and patient." 
However, ISME volunteer, Ken Traeger stressed that the bill is not 
directed toward doctor-patient relationships, but toward " non-
therapeutic" activity, where the treatment is not directly beneficial or an 
orthodox cure is being withheld. 

Traeger said the bill has virtually no opposition because it does not 
oppose all experimentation. "But we are against it when the individual's 
rights are pushed down in favor of test tubes," he said. 

ISME is working to support all legislation which insures " the protection 
of patients regarding human experimentation and to firmly establish 
their rights under the law," according to the goals set forth by the group. 
Traeger saw its establishment as a response to " the mystique in 
California that the doctor is God" and that if a person is sick, the doctor is 
given free license to do what he wants. i Lane said the prisoners and mental patients are "sometimes cheaper 

eli than monkeys," and are frequently used in experiments. The UC Law 
;;: Review of 1974 reported that " the unique isolation of prisoners and staff 

~ behind prison walls can conceal experiments of questionable quality from ~ public security and control." An affidavit submitted by a Vacaville 
a prisoner stated that he was threatened with solitary confinement if he did 
t: not participate in the experiments. No consent form was issued and often 

Krasnov believes that "private 
property can best secure the ri,ghts 
of an individual," and said that the 
fact that private property is totally 
denied in the USSR makes the 
"individual powerless and 
dependent upon the Communist 
state." Krasnov also asserted that 
human rights denial in the USSR 
"is simply a Sophisticated and 
more hidden fonn of slavery,' with 
a single owner-the state." 

UC Berkeley professor Dr. Andrew Janos was one of six speakers at several opposing drugs were administered simultaneously. 
Monday ni!:lht's Young AmerlcQns for Freedom Human Rights seminar. ~ 

Alan Russell Elected New The human rights seminar, 
sponsored by UCSD's Young 
Americans for Freedom, also 
consisted of speakers from 
Eastern Europe who have been 
involved with improving human 
rights in those Communist coun-
tries. 

US Has "Bent Over Backwards" 
Ann Watson, a dissident from 

Eastern Europe, stated that US 
foreign policy toward the USSR 
must change. "For the last 60 
years, the American government 
has bent over backward to please 
the Soviet Union by giving aid and 

"Now that the USSR has caught 
up with the US, I believe they will 
act very quickly in the next 20 
years to make us sufficiently fear 
them and their power," Olasky 
said, and further elucidated upon 
this point by suggesting that 
President Carter's present policy 
is useless and no longer practical, 
since the USSR has risen from the 
need for co-existence into a 
position of • • power control." 

Czechoslovakian dissident Karel 
Kovanda said "the defense of 
human rights has no separation of 
ideology within America. People

from Communist religious per-
secution, said that the solution lies 
in active involvement. He told the 
audience, composed mostly of non-
students, to "get involved right 
here and now for what you can do 
and don 't simply stand by and hope 
for the best. " 

In an emotional moment, 
Wurmbrand bitterly attacked 
Communist Leaders calling them 
"greedy" in their quest for 
" power." He concluded : "Com-
munism has not realized its high 
ideals, but has only created prisons 
and extermination." 

Triton Times Executive Editor 
by Dave Elsen 

Executive Editor 
Alan Russell, a Fourth College 

junior, .was elected Triton Times 
Executive editor for 1977-78, in a 
vote of the paper's staff Monday. 

Russell, who was this year's 
Triton Times News editor, will 
supervise all operations of the 
paper, with prilflary respon-
sibilities involving financial 
budgeting, public relations and 

newspaper policy. 
Russell had previously been a 

Triton Times Arts editor and st.:tff 
writer. He will begin his leadership 
of the Executive Board July 1. 

The other eight board positions 
were chosen from a field of 21 
applicants in a vote of the current

More Student Loan Money May be Available 
by Hogb MclDtOlb 

Staff Correspondeot 
SACRAMENTO -- The state 
legislature took action last week on 
two measures designed to make 
more money available for student 
loans. 

One bill, AS 647, would have the 
state guarantee student loans from 
baw. 'niP. other SB 10, would 

Harrington on 
The American 
Dream/Reality 

Michael Harrington, chainnan 
of the Democratic Socialist 
Organizing Committee and past 
chairman of the United States 
Socialist Party, will speak Thurs-
day night at 8:00 in the Mandeville 
auditorium. 

Harrlngton, who has worked 
with such noted Americans as 
Norman Thomas, Martin Luther 
King, Eugene McCarthy and 
Robert Kennedy, follows fonner

Clark In speaking in the Ma& 
deville Lecture series on "The 
American Dream." 

make the state a direct lender. The 
former successfully passed two 
committees in the Assembly, but 
the latter was voted down in a 
Senate conuniUee. 

The atteIDJt to get the state 
involved in the student loan 
program was prompted by the 
increasing maber of banks which 
have curtailed their loans to 
students or have stopped them 
altogether. 

"Students from middle-income 
families are especially hard hit 
because they do not qualify for 
increasing grant aid going to the 
poorest students," said Assembly 
member John Vasconcellos when 
he Introduced AS 647. 

"Graduate students from both 
income backgrounds also suffer 
from the dImInishing student loan 
market," he said. 

Banks witbdrawlDllo8DJ 
California banks are with-

drawing from the student loan 
program because of high default 
rates and bureaucratic delay by 
the federal government which 
guarantees the loans, Vasconcellos 
said. Nationally, the default rate is 
20 percent. 

VasconceU08' bill would enable 
the State Student Aid Commission 
to guarantee 8tud .. t loins made 

by California banks. The banks 
would continue to make the loans 
and the federal govenunent would 
continue to back them up. But the 
state of California would guarantee 
that default claimB are handled 
quickly. 

SB 10, sponsored by SeJl8tor Bill 
Green (D-Loa Angeles), would 
have authorized the state to 
become a direct lender. This would 
have cut the banks out of the 
student loan program. 

Stella Epat of Security Pacific's 
student loan department, said it 
did not matter to her whether the 
state became a guarantor or a 
direct lender. 

wm banks get out? 
" We are obligated to make 

student loans as a conununity 
service," she said. When asked if 
Security Pacific would like to get 
out of the student loan business, 
she replied, " We certainly don't 
make any profit." 

Terry Oflock, manager of the 
Wells Fargo student loan de-
partment, said Wells Fargo wants 
to stay In the student loan business. 
He said his department is not as 
profitable as other departments in 
the bank, but they stay In the 
business as a matter of "social 
conadence" . 

The UC Student Lobby supports 
Vasconcellos' bill to make the state 
a guarantor, and opposed Greene's 
bill to make ita direct lender. 

"There is no need to create 
another state agency to do what 
banks are already in the busmess 
of doing," said Phyllse Smith, ro-
director of the Lobby in testimony 
against Greene's bill. 

A direct-lender system would 
place state-loan money in direct 
competition with state-grant 
money, Smith said. This would 
have an adverse effect on the 
number of low-income students 
able to attend public post-
secondary schools. 

• Stephen Arditti, a lobbyist for the 
University of California, said he 
also fears a state loan program 
might decrease the amount of 
money available for student 
grants. 

State 'As direct lender" 
"We feel it's a case of walking 

before runnin ," Arditti said " If 
the state as a guarantor does not 
stimulate enough (student loan) 
funds out of the private sector, then 
we might go with the state as a 
direct lender." 

Private schools, however, would 
very much lik the state to become

a direct lender, said Alvar 
Yelvington, executive director of 
the California Association for 
Private Education. 

"We need a lender right away," 
Yelvington said. "Making the state 
a guarantor does nothing for 
proprietary schools." · Banks are 
not lending to students in private 
schools, and without these low-<:ost 
loans several private schools 
might go under, he said. 

Lobby C(Htirector Smith said 
banks do not lend to private-school 
students because their default 
rates are high. 

Yelvington deined that the 
default rate of students attending 
private schools is higher than that 
of students attending public 
schools like UC . 

The default rate of students 
attending a few unsound vocational 
schools has been high, he said. But 
there is no difference between the 
default rates of students attending 
private orpublic four-year colleges 
and universities.
