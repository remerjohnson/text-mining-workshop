Muir Holiday 
May be a Turkey 

By· Eric Harpell 
Staff Wri&er 

As Thanksgiving approach-
es, the traditional attitude of 
generosity with the holiday 
appears to be missing among 
faculty and staff, as well as 
students, of Muir College. 

In order that Muir students 
who are unable to attend 
Thanksgiving dinner with their 
fa milies would not be de-
prived of a Turkey dinner, 
letters were sent out to faculty 
and staff members asking them 
to entertain Muir students for 
dinner next Thursday night. 
Conversely, students were 
given the opportunity to sign up 
at Page One if they wished to 
have dinner with generous 
faculty or staff members, said 
Bobbie Gray, Muir Activities 
Coordinator. 

Faculty members proved 
less than generous, however, as 
"only two have signed up," said 
Gray. Students also displayed 
di interest in the Thanksgiving 
dinner program, with only two 
replying. Said Gray, in refer-
ence to the one-to-one ratio: "It 
mi.ht work out pretty well." 

Residents of the Muir apart-
ments, however, will have their 

own opportunity to attend a 
traditional 'I'hanksgiving feast. 
Invitations received by Muir 
apartment-dwellers ask that 
the students "bring something: 
(salad, dessert or beverages") 
for the Thursday night dinner to 
be held in the Muir apartment 
lounge. The traditional main 
course, turkey, will be provided 
free of charge. 

Letters were placed in the 
mailbOxes of faculty and staff 
members with an explanation 
of the faculty /staff dinner 
program and instructions to 
contact Bobbie Gray " prior to 
November 16 ." Only two 
faculty members replied: 
Steve Howel, Associate Pr('-
fessor of Biology, and Sarah 
Wickhart of the P.E. depart-
ment. . 

Staff participation in the 
Muir Thanksgiving dinner 
program is limited to Bobbie 
Gray's co-workers at the Muir 
Residence Hall office. A ha 
been the case over the last three 
years, Gray will be "having 
students over for dinner ." 
Fondly recalling the previous 
three Thanksgivings, Gray 
de cribed her experiences with 
the students as "r ally en-
Joyable."

Tbe Muir College Council is considering changing the name of the John Muir Apartments to 
Tuolumne Apartments, according to Acting Dean Judith Green. 

Tuolumne is the name of a meadow and waterfall in Yosemite Valley. 
"The college staff is supportive of the name cbange," said Green, and added that tbe name 

cbange would be consistent witb the Yosemite theme of the campus resident halls. 
Tbe Muir Housing and Food Services is presently conducting a survey to get student input on 

the suggested name change. "If the student like it, the Muir College Council will recommend tbe 
name to the campus Committee on Names," said Green. 

Tbe Council is asking that Muir students come to the Dean's Office in HSS 2125 as soon as

URS Ethnicity Seminar 
By Judy Walton 

Sellior Staff Writer 
"Ethnicity in the Social 

Sciences" was the main theme 
of a day-long Conference on the 
Social Sciences sponsored by 
Urban and Rural Studies 
(URS) students last Saturday. 

The conference, which was 
held in Third College cafeteria, 
featured speakers from the 
community representing a 
broad spectrum of the social 
sciences. From anthropology to 
economics to political science, 
guest speakers attempted to 
provide a basic concept of 
ethnicity in the social sciences 
and a definition of ethnicity 
within the community. 

Steven Golin, a URS student, 
opened the day with a talk on 
the attitudes maintained by 
psychology faculty members 
relating to racial bias. He found 
that the majority of non-whites 
noticed a lack of sensitivity and 
serious commitment to equal 
treatment, while most whites 
adopted what he called a 
"benevolent attitude" toward 
other racial groups. 

Also scheduled were 
speakers on public education 
within the San Diego com-
munity. The concept of bi-
lingual, bicultural education 
was defined as "the acknowl-
edgement of personal accep-
tance of the culturally plural-
istic nature of American 
society," and its fundamental 
importance in ' public chools 
was tressed. 

Yvonne Johnson, Director of 
Urban Affair for an _Diego 
City chools , discu s d th 
Race/Human Relation Pro-
gram which i de igned to link 
de egregation with true in-
tegration. Johnson discussed 
the San Diego plan to imple-
ment court-ordered de egre-

gation mandated by the Carlin 
vs. Board of Education decision 
two years ago. "The San Diego 
plan is voluntary, based on 
'magnet schools , ' learning 
centers and special programs 
within schools," she said. "The 
magnet schools, such as the 
bilingual magnet, the funda-

mental, 'back to basics' mag-
net, and the computer science, 
technical training magnet have 
been very successful in at-
tracting students from all over 
the community . The ethnic 
compositions within these 
programs are engineered," she

UCLA Might 
Sprout Derricks 

By Kathy Huffer 
UCLA may soon be the site of 

oil produ ction , ultimately 
helping to offset some of the 
University of California's 
financial burdens. 

According to Dr. George 
Vajna , a UCLA planning 
commissioner, oil production is 
still " very far in the future." 
But he added that exploratory 
drilling may begin as early as 
thi summer. 

The southern portion of the 
UCLA campus has been the 
object of crutiny by several oil 
companies for several years, 
who believe that sufficient oil 
pools may exist in the UCLA 
property to merit drilling. 
Vajna estimated that "there is 
a 50-50 chance" that oil will be 
found. Though, he aid, "They 
might dig, dig, dig and find 
nothing. " 

Drilling exploration will take 
pia ' to determine if there i 
enough oil to warrant produc-
tion, according to Vajna. But 
before drilling will be per-
mitted , an environmental 
impact tudy mu t be made, he 
aid. 
The study will be made by a 

consultant retained by UC 

Treasurer Herbert Gordon . 
Vajna said that "if the impact 
study is promising," the next 
step will be to produce a draft of 
the results . 

UCLA's Chancellor Charles 
Young i somewhat keptical 
about future oil drilling on the 
campus, according to Vajna . 
" He (the Chancellor) opposes 
the causes of oil production," 
Vajna said. "Perhap after the 
environmental asse ment is 
completed," Vajna added, "he 
may like the idea better. He 
wants to avoid inconven-
iences." 

Exploratory drilling , if 
approved, will take place on 
two acres of UCLA property, 
Vajna said. The area is cur-
rently the site of a campu 
parking lot. 

Mor than 300 pace would 
be d~placed if drilling oc-
curred, according to a recent 
article ill UCLA's Dail Bruin .

elle Five' Were Condemned Unjustly 
Editor: 

Aa of TueLJdBy November 14. 
Revelle', Re.ldent Dean. 
Judith EdwiD. aDd her staff 
bave seeD ftt to _rYe Justice In 
the C88e of the Revelle Cafe-
teria food filbt by handinl a biD 
of dam ..... totalUq close to 
one thouaaDd dollars. to a II'OUP 
of five Revelle .tudents. This 
action II clarinlly and patently 
unfair. not only In that it is far 
too severe on those being 
punished by It, but also in that it 
reinforces the opinion one can 
do anything as long as one does 
not get caught. 

It is true that Ms. Edwin was 
faced with a difficult decision: 
nevertheless it appears that. of 
the choices open to her, she has 
opted fo r the worst of a ll 
possib le evil s. Besides the 
action decided upon, the office 
of the Dean had at least two 
other alternatives open to it . 

First of all there existed the 
possibility tbat the school , 
realizing that the affair gener-
ated a release of aggressions 
built up, to a large extent, by 
the school itself, would take the 
burden of the expenses upon 
itself. (Indeed, one might ask if 
the estimate of costs might 
possibly have been consider-
ably smaller in tbe event of 

such • deciIIoD). However. to 
expect the school, when it baa 
control of the power In a liveD 
situation, to turn the other 
cheek II both somewbat naive 
and, perbape, not altotether 
fair. 

Tbe second alternative con-
sidered by the administration 
was one that would bave 
iIlvolved fining all students who 
reside at Revelle. This option. 
too, baa it s obvious intrinsic 
infringements upon Justice, 
since the fine would bave been 
levied on those who did not 
participate as well as upon 
those who did. 

The question, therefore, is 
not one or Justice, a concept 
whose prinCiples cannot be 
served under any of the avail-
able alternatives, but rather 
one of guilt. By singling out at 
random five individuals and 
saddling them with the entire 
bill the Resident Dean is not 
only punishing them with a 
disproportionate amount of the 
monetary responsibility, but is 
also condemning them to be 
scapegoats for tbe unified 
action of a large aggregation. 
In other words, five students 
are being held guilty for an 
action in which they took pan 

lal'ler whole. which itself wu

Why Muir College Nights Are Silent 
Editor: 

I can hardly say that I was 
surprised to read in even Tbe 
Guardian that Muir is a dull. 
deso late , dead , depr iv ed , 
depressing , dismal fa ilure. 
After all, students have been 
saying just that for ten years 
now. It's sort of a tradition we 
have here. 

To start with, I should explain 
tbat I am a sophomore at Muir, 
and enjoy it here. Yes,l not only 
enjoy it here, 1' 1\ admit to it. 
For a year I have tried to figure 
out why so many people gripe. 
a nd I ha ve come up wi th 
several possibilities: 

1) It is THE thing- to do and 
say. Some people will never be 
happy anywhere, and these 
unfortunate cynics seem to 
have a majority at Muir and 

THE

News 

UCSD. 
2) Perhaps UCSD draws 

more of these pessimists 
because they did not know 
where to go to school, so they 
came to a campus on the beach, 
only planning to stay ror a year 
or two . Of course, none of these 
people would subject them-
selves to the Revelle curric-
ulum , which calls for true 
dedication and motivation. 

3) Too many people, again, 
according to tradition, lea ve ror 
weekends, or live off campus. 
After a ll, campus is dead, isn' t 
it? 

4) I think the University is 
also to blame to a certain 
extent. UCSD is a research 
oriented institution that began 
with only graduate students, 

and continues to deify its 
graduate departments. I 
hereby call upon the Captains 
or Erudition to proverbially 
take an (lowly) undergrad to 
lunch today, perhaps office 
hours. or discussions In class 
would be a start. Maybe TAB 
should be done away with and 
professors should run all 
sections when possible. 

Also, a conscious "anti-jock" 
policy on the part of tbe 
Administration, designed to 
keep our teams from getting too 
good, or too much money , 
prevent any central activity 
that might draw students from 
all four colleges together. 
Probably a feature, along with 
the four colleges themselves, 
designed to prevent any trouble

Adopts New Admissions Policy 
.,Erie HarpeII 

..... w ....... 
A new let of UC admiulOlll 

criteria dlat p18Ce1 IDcreued 
empbaala on staDdardized test 
ICOres will ,0 Into effect this 
year. 

Until Nov.l,lm, acceptaDce 
Into the UC system required 
only a 3.1 arade aver.,e, or 
colle,e board test scores (SAT 
and 3 achievement tests) 
totaling 2500 . Satisfactory 
completion of specific courses 
desipated by the "A throu,h 
F " requirements was also 
manditory . 

The new system will place 
more emphasis on test scores 
and less empha-sis on high . 
school grade point averages 
(GPA) . Students with GPAs 
above 3.30 will stiJI be eligible 
for admission on grade average 
alone , while students with 
averages below 2.78 will not be 
considered (or admission 
unless they achieve perfect 

New System Will Place More Emph_ls on 
Tait Scores, Minorities Will Suffer MOlt 

scores on the con.,e board 
testa. 

The reason for the chaDle, 
accordln, to Ronald Bowker, 
UCSD registrar, is that "the 
level of freshman accepted has 
dropped from the top 12"!0 to 
about the top 17% or 1~0 or 
California hi,h school students. 
The law states that the Uni· 
versity of California accept the 
top 12%." 

Bowker, who considers part 
of his job, " trying to get 
students to attend UCSD, " 
attributes the rise primarily to 
grade inflation. " It's easier to 
get higher grades, in the public 
schools as well as here, as 
compared to 5-10 years ago." 
Bowker added, " There is also 
the problem with private 

schools." Many private acbools 
offer exceUent collqe prepar-
atory proarama. and subae-
quently offer difficult clalSeS 
with higb gradiq oriteria. The 
student who acbleves lower 
marks from a private school 
will often score relatively higb 
on the College Board tests. 

In brief, the new criteria for 
undergraduate admission 
consists of achieving a grade 
point average above 2.78. with 
an. SAT or ACT test score 
satisfying the requirements for 
that particular grade average . 
For example, the student with a 
2 .78 grade average will be 
required to score 1600 (a 
perfect score) on ,the SAT, the 
student with a 3 .30 grade 
average will need only a 400

(the minimum score) on the 
SAT. The student who meets 
the past criteria with a 3.1 
avera,e will bJ! required to 
score 850 on the SAT. 

The new requirement will 
eliminate many of the students 
who scored over 2500 on their 
college boards but did very 
little in regards to achieving 
high marks in school. Those 
most affected, according to 
past trends, will be minority 
students. According to Bowker, 
the "SAT shows a cultural 
bias," as students from inner 
city schools with large minority _ 
populations tend to score lower 
than the average on the tests. 

There is a faculty committee 
that meets and discusses 
applications of students who,

for a variety of reasons, did DOt 
meet the admialiona criteria, 
but appear to be good can-
didates for becomin, 1Ucceu-
ful colle,e students. "Many of 
the ItUdents selected by the 
committee are minority .tu· 
dents," said Bowker. 

How Will the new require-
ments affect the number of 
students enteriDl UCSD? Not 
much, accordiDl to current 
statistics re,ardin, SAT 
scores. The median SAT score 
from past testing results of ali 
UCSD students , was 1090 
combined (Verbal and Math) . 
This would correspond to a 3.0 
grade average in the new 
system. The 3.0 grade avera,e 
is well below the norm or high 
school grade averages of 
current UCSD underclassmen. 

According to Bowler, "if you 
score above the requirements, 
nothing is goin, to keep you 
out." But ror the student who 
rails to meet the acceptance 
requirements , only special 
action by the faculty committee 
will allow them to gain admit· 
tance. Four percent of the total 
number of students admitted 
last year were admitted by 
special action . When con· 
sidering special action , the 
committee evaluates the type 
of courses the student has 
taken, whether the student has 
come from a disadvantaged 
educational background, and 
the quality or the application 
itself. 

The essay, which is manda-
tory on all applications ror 
undergraduate admisSion, is 
not evaluated for students who 
meet UC requirements , but is 
considered in the evaluation of 
" special action" students. On 
all applications. the essay is 
read, and placed on file at the 
Registrars Office. One reason, 
said Bowker, that the essay is 
not weighed heavily is "you can 
never be sure that the student 
actually wrote the essay. " 
Added Bowker, "After you read 
so many of them (the essays) , 
tbey all begin to seem the 
same." 

For students who meet 
admissions requirements prior 
to completion of their junior 
year, only failure to graduate 
from high school can prevent 
their acceptance at UCSD. 
Students who are borderline 
applicants, are responsible for 
satisfactory performance in

Plans for oil drilling first

a Regents' meeting held in Sao

noted that the meeting waa beld 
behind closed doors. The 
Re,ents dlscuued andpaaaed a 
proposal to conduct an environ-

the new.paper. 

Initial Investment costs will 
be incurred by the oU company 
that leases the land. 

Offlclals .have estimated that 
tbe resultant income from 011

that the figure "may be

Pol Isis Take Third 
Riverside Tourney 

ByJ .. Goe&z 
SeIIIer sc.rr .lilel' 

Winnina is a hard habit for 
the water polo team to break. In 
the process of accumul~ting 
their sixth tbrough Dlntb 
consecutive victories, they won 
their third straigbt UC River-
side Tournament cbampion-
ship. 

Tbe tourney marked the end 
of the season for the Tritons, so 
they wiU have to resume their 
babit next September. Winning 
their last nine , tbe team 
finished with 17 wins and 9 
losses . Coach Russ Haffer-
kamp, ending his second year 
at the helm of the young squad, 
steered UCSD to a 33-15 overall 
record since 1977. 

The team traveled to River-
side Friday with their goal o( 
bringing back another first 
place trophy. Their first 
obstacle to that goal, Loyola-
Marymount, proved to be little 
but a good warmup for UCSD, 
as they tamed the Lions 12-6. 
Dnn Eby, Kai Loedel and Je(( 
Elliott combined for nine goals, 
and Dan Crane, Tom Enger and 
Mark LaMattina aU pitched in 
to defeat Loyola for the second 
time this year. 

Starting the game slowly, 
with a 1-1 deadlock after the 
first period , the Tritons 
smothered the Lions with 11 
goals spread out through the 
next three quarters. Their slow 
beginning became the prece-
dent for UCSD early game play 
in the remaining games of the 
tournament. 

The Tritons returned to the 
pool later that day to face Cal 
State Los Angeles, who h~d 
beaten UCSD once in two 
matches against them this 
year. The Diablos held them to 
three points in the first half, to

their own five. But San Diego, 
bebind the five scores of Crane, 
bammered their opponents for 
nine goals in the next half to win 
12-6, tilting the series against 
CSLA 2-1 in their favor. 

Tbat niPt the team, without 
the funds for a hotel room, 
rolled out their sleeping bags in 
the Riverside weight room, for 
a very uncomfortable sleep. In 
the momiDI their scheduled 
opponents, Santa Clara, gave 
UCSD a forfeit win. Needing to 
tune up for their tilt against 
UCR in the afternoon, the 
Tritons split up for an intra-
squad game. 

TheD came the showdown: 
the match against Riverside, 
also 3-0 in the tourney, for the 
championship. Never trailing 
the Highlanders, UCSD rolled 
to a 6-2 advantage after a 
quarter, 9-5 at half, and finisbed 
them off 14-11 to take the 
tropby. The entire team got 

some playing time, and goalie 
Willie Morris took a tum at 
playing the field. Eigbt people 
coDtributed to tbe score, led by 
Eby's four goals, two by Greg 
Maletis , Mark G9rdon and 
Loedel, and points by Jim SeDl, 
Elliott, Tracy Patrick and Tom 
Jorgensen. 

Team captain Jorgensen, 
who played his last game 
Saturday, will be missed by the 
team. "Tommy 's not out· 
spoken, but in his own way he 
held the team together," said 
Hafferkamp. "All the guys on 
the team respected bim, and 
I've got a lot of respect for bim 
too. " 

Already preparing for next 
year, the team is planning on 
picking up some added ex· 
perience by playing AA U ball 
this spring. Hafferkamp hopes 
this will help to compensate for 
the late start the Triton squad 
gets every fall. 

Fencers Swept 
in Last Matches 

By Philip Sorensen 
The UCSD fencing team 

closed out its fall season in a 
not-so-grand fashion Saturday, 
as they were swept by Cal State 
Long Beach and Cal State 
Northridge by respective 
scores of 26-10 and 21-15. The 
dual match was held at North-
ridge. 

Against Long Beach, UCSD 
took a 5-4 decision in the 
saberist event, but suffered an 
8·1 loss in the epee event and a 7-
2loss in men's foil. The women 
foilists also lost by a 7·2 score. 

In the second match , the epee 
team came up with a 6-3 
victory, beating the Northridge 
epeeists. But losses in men's 
foil (6-3) and saber (7-2), a long 
with a 5-4 loss in the women's 
foil event, gave CSUN a 2H5 
victory. 

Though the Tritons were up 
against " two of the better 
teams in the league," Coach 
John Helmich did not see this as 
the main reason for his team's 
disappointing defeats. 

"We expected both teams to 
be " he said, "but no 

one fenced up to their ability at 
all. " 

With a couple of wins, or even 
a split, UCSD could have m?~ed 
from their fourth place poSitIon 
up iDto one of the top three spots 
in the NCAA Div. III standings. 

As it turned out, the Tritons 
were able to come up with 
victories in only one of the (our 
events against each team, 
enabling their opponents to 
take decisive overall victories. 
The losses dropped the Tritons ' 
record to below .500 (3-4-1). and 
will most likely bring them 
down a notch or two in the 
league standings. 

When asked to comment on 
his team's final showing of the 
fall season, Helmich summed 
up the team's frustration , 
saying that it was "the end o( a 
long quarter." He added that 
the women's team had made 
good progress and that they 
" did not look too bad" in 
Saturday's match. 

The Tritons will return to 
action in January when they 
will compete in an All- Cal

just that, the old Dylan. Uke 
settling iD for a Digbt of 
listening to Hilbway IJ 
Revililed and pulling out the 
old snap sbots of the march on 
WashingtoD. But if you came 
for just the memories, you 
missed balf Ute show. And you 

missed half of Dylan. 
Friday Digbt, DylaD was 

more than just the folk song 
warrior singing the anthems of 
a social revolution long since 
over. Friday night he was a new 
musician and soDgwriter, not 
afraid to try new things , 
sometimes stumbling, but orten 
good, even brilliant. 

Bob Dylan is finally making 
the transitioD - from cult hero 
of a generation to an estab-
lished and lasting musical 
force. He showed that Friday 
night at the Sports Arena. We 
saw Dylan put his music 
tbrough some rougb and tum-
ble rock arrangements. briefly 
flirt with some Las Vegas style 
staging, and even survive the 
onslaught of three older , 
overweight, minimally tal-
ented and washed-out second 
cousins of The Supremes, who 
he used as back-up singers. 

But througb it all, Dylan and 
his music came through. The 
old songs were still very good. 
The new songs were different 
and challenging, but you faintly 

thought that some might be the 
best Dylan has written to date. 

"Senor," especially as Dylan 
sang it Friday night, grabbed 
you with its vagueness and left 
you puzzling and wondering, as 
Dylan, where we're heading, 
"Lincoln COUDty Road or 
Armegeddon." Dylan's encore, 
"Changing of the Guards," the 
lead track from his new Screet 
Legal, was spirited and 
driving, as ambiguous as " All 
along the Watchtower" ever 
was, and just as good. 

So, that was the other half of 
The Show, the other half of 
Dylan. 

Friday night, that was the 
wonder of it all . That Dylan 
wasn't shutting any doors or 
burning any bridges. He could 
still sing the old stuff, dif-
ferently , but like he meant it. 
And yet he could still forge 
ahead, not disdainful of the 
past, but not tied down by it. 

What Joan Baez called the 
"savage gift" in Dylan is still 
intact. And he moves on. 

"Bob Dylan is finally making the 
transition - from cult hero ... to an 
established and lasting musical 
force."

iki Dee Returns 
A Hope for Female Vocalist. Field 

By 11m MaekeIlzIe 
C.artllll •• EtU .... 

The state of female vocalists 
on the pop music scene today is 
routhly similar to the status of 
the ERA. Pro,ress should be 
made in bringin, more women 
into the Jimelilbt, but for some 
reason nothing much seems to 

. be happening. 
Looking broadly (ugb) 

across the spectrum of pop 
music, women are relegat~ to 
a distant second status behmd 
their male counterparts . 
Women just don' t appear with 
any longevity on the star front, 
opting to either drop out of the 
picture or to go the Vegas route, 
wbere they be..COme lost along 
with the rest of the crowd. Jonl

much twadle. After all, the guy 
is probably gay anyway. . . 

One of the really promlsmg 
female talents of a few years 
back was Kiki Dee. I hadn' t 
seen Klki Dee since she opened 
for the Elton John tour four 
years ago, and I was curious to 
see how she had changed. I 
jumped at the opportunity to 
catch her act at the Golden 
Bear in Huntington Beach, 
driving up to see her first oftwo 
shows last Sunday. 

Her show was indeed an· 
excellent indication that som~ 
thing exciting is happening 10 
the realm of female vocalists. It 
was professional to a tee and, 
aided by the cozy confines of the 
Golden Bear, a fun show to 
boot. .

lreatneu, it nonetbeleu (in 
Kiki Dee's case) served to 
emphasize that she could be a 
force to contend with In P,Op 
music. The other strong m-
dicators are her last two 
albums, Kiki Dee andS&ay WI" 
Me. Both were really pleasant 
records to liIten to, mix In. 
lighter pop ballads with some 
soulfullUlB-type stuff . 

The majority of the material 
she performed was off of the 
last two recorda, with some of 
her oldies ("I Got Tbe Music In 
Me, " "You Need Help") 
thrown in also. Aided by a solid 
band featuring Davey John-
stone' on guitar (Elton's ex) and 
Bias Boshell (of the old Kiki 
Dee Band) on piano, Dee's 
performance was near flaw-
less. The tone of her recent 
recorded work has tended to 
stay away from blasting rock n' 
roll but her Golden Bear set de~onstrated that she can still 
rock it wltbout being over-
bearing. 

'Middle Class' 
a UCSD Hit 

After her debut with Elton 
John a few years back, Dee 
kind of dropped from sipt. But 
the wait was well worth it. Kiki 
Dee is a classy singer with a 
great voice and she seems more 
poised and self-assured than 
before. Finally music has a 
happening lady.

mellow confines of the Future 
Foods buildiDi. The show (and 
yes, experience) tum.ed out to 
be a very interestlnl one, 
especially In terms of audience 
involvement - the crowd was 
sometimes more fun to watch 
than the banda. 

Middle Class provided most 
of the excitement, playin~ fast, 
basic rough and tough, WIth the obvi~ intention of inciting the 
crowd to "pOlO." For the 
uninitiated, pogolng consists of 
dancing (to a limi~ ~xtent), 
pushing shoving, collIding and 
falling .:..- in short, painful fun . 
The UCSD audience seemed ~o 
enjoy the band's efforts to this 
end, and the band seemed ~o 
think they had succeeded m 
achieving what they were after . 
It is difficult to critique Middle 
Class on a musical level -
perhaps "music" is not one of 
their ends - but if the inten~ 
treatment they gave to theIr 
only non-original (the Modem 
Lovers ' cult classic "She 
Cracked") is any indiclltion. 
this Orange County (!) group 
shows a lot of promise. 

The AUeycats seemed tame 
by comparision (few bands 
would,!' t) , but they, too , 
displayed a great deal of 
energy, most of it directed into 
the often complex framework 
or their music.

students are considered " bor-

(ailed to complete the required 
courses, but have sufficientiy 
high grade averages. 

According to Bowker, " Tech-
nically, all students accepted 
for the University of California 
are accepted on probation until 
they graduate from high 
school. " In the majority of 
cases, probation is only de-
pendent on the student' s 
graduation from high school. In 
some cases , bow ever , the 

student is actuaIJy accepted 'on 
probation.' " Students in tbjs 
group usually include those 
who have not completed their 
"A through F " requirements, 
or who have borderline grade 
averages . If the missing 
course(s) is taken in the senior 
year of high school, and is 
satisfactorily completed, then 
the student is removed from 
probation and permitted to 
enroll.

projects conducted by San 
Dieao'l CalPIRG (California 
Public Interest Researcb 
Group), a completely student 
controlled ,roup dedicated to 
the cause of consumer protec-
tion. 

Inspired by Ralpb Nader and 
bis call for consumer activism 
on college campuses, CalPIRG 
was founded by several UCSD 
students in 1970 and operates in 
conjunction with San Diego 
State and USD. Following San 
Diego's lead, similar groups 
have formed at Berkeley and 
Santa Clara. 

A student representative of 
CalPIRG. Susan Flick, empha-
sized that " we don 't want 
students to think we are taking 
money from them. CalPIRG is 
completely student run and 
provides an excellent op-
portunity for students to get 
involved in campus and com-
mur.ity projects , and gain 

valuable experteace 1a tile area 
of coaawner la •. " She des-
cribed woJtiq witb CalPIRG 
81 a areat way to expaDd a 
atudeat's leal'll1q experieDce 
beyond tile clauroom and to 
explore variOUI career alter-
nativ ... 

CalPIRG'1 projects, ac-
cordia, to Flick, include a 
consumer assistance botllDe, 
food-price surveys, a tenant-
landlord raeareb II"OUP, and 

.,.n enero van, a mobil edu-
cation facility of energy 
alternatives. Other research 
projects include surveys of San 
Diego's municipal investment 
in South Africa, of local banks 
and student services, of the 
housing condition in Linda 
Vista, and of local dentists, 
physicians, and attorneys. The 
results of these studies are 
published in the monthly 
CalPIRG Reports. 

An important project to the 
UCSD community, soon to be 
undertaken, i~ a survey of 
Student Health Services. Flick 
encourages any student in-
terested in this, or any other of 
CaIPIRG's projects, to join. 
Some students have received 
academic credit for their work 
in CaIPIRG, she said. 

The many activities of 

CalPIRG are coordinated by 
prof.,slonal .taff bired by 
ItUclenti. CalPIRG bu just 
recently hired two DeW co-
directors, ChriI Walker and 
John Sachs. 

SacM, a lI"aduate of Westem 
State Univenlty law acbool, 
de.cribed CalPIRG as .. an 
lnvaluable broker of consumer 
information to the San Diego 
Community." (San Dieao b81 
no Consumer Protection Agen-
cy .) He described the im-
portance of CalPIRG as "its 
higb credibility and visibility in 
the consumer protection area. 
Its impact is widespread, it's 
like the Midas touch, good as 
gold." The group has been 
responsible for a number of 
class-action lawsuits and state 
legislation in recent years. 

Sachs described the biggest 
problem of CalPIRG as under-
staffing." As all of the research 
is done by students and com-
munity volunteers the magni-
tude of the possible projects is 
limited by the number of people 
.involved and the time they can 
invest, he said. 

CalPIRG board meetings are 
held every other Thursday at 10 
am in the North Conference 
Room.

added. 

The race/human relations 
board reviews all desegre-
gation plans drafted by local 
schools on an "individualized 
basis." The concepts of race 
and human relations are tied 
together, in a developmental 
context, said Johnson. 

Randy Woodard, counselor 
for the Disabled Students Union 
(DSU) at UCSD, spoke on the 
topic of special education in the 
public school system. Wood-
ard explained several rea-
sons why many physically 
disabled persons become 
disenchanted at an early age. 
He urged a deemphasis on 
labeling and stereotyping, 
which cause self-perceptions of 
inferiority. He recommended 
defining one broad class of 
"physically handicapped" to 
exclude such special problems 
as obesity, skin problems, and 
others which are today singled 
out for special attention. "If a 
high school kid has a bad case of 
zits and finds out he is defined 
as 'physically handicapped,' 
this can cause a lot of emotional 
damage," said Woodard. 

During the lunch break, 
which featured a variety of

ethnic dishes , the audience 
interacted with the speakers 
and expressed enthusiasm 
about the "success" of the 
conference. Explained Chris 
Moore, a student in URS 111, 
"The idea of a conference 
began as a class project. We 
divided the class into two 
groups - the 'we care' and 'we 
don't care' groups. The entire 
planning, arranging and pub-
licity for this conference was 
the special project of the we 
care group, and its goal was to 
make people aware of ethnic 
problems in the community," 
said Moore. • 'Too many social 
science courses don't ever get 
out of the classroom or lab and 
into practice," he added. 

Art Goodman, Vice-Presi-
dent of Economic Development 
of the San Diego Urban League, 
began the afternoon session by 
stressing the "need to find 
business-qualified minorities" 

and to promote growth of small 
businesses in minority com-
munities. "The biggest fight 
today is housing," he added and 
mentioned that despite $12 
million being spent on develop-
ing the Marina housing on the 
harbor, the lowest priced units 
will start at $85,000. 

Dr . Charles W. Thomas, 
coordinator of Urban and Rural 
Studies, who teaches URS 111, 
was pleased at the success of 
the conference. "My philo-
sophy is to give the students a 
professional applied focus," he 
said. "This conference has 
successfully represented what 
I call a 'celebration of dif-
ferences,' a recognition that 
new questions may be asked 
and that new viewpoints may 
exist besides those dominant in 
social thought today. Science is 
merely an expression of cul-
ture," said Thomas.
