UCSD accepts the bet, 
takes part in sick drills 
MTV's 'I Bet You Will' filmed on 
campus, exchanges cash for stunts 
By JOSH CROUSE 
News Editor 

Half-naked men, gobs of pud-
ding, buckets of vomit and crisp $20 
bills were all sights UCSD was treat-
ed to by MTV's new game show, "I 
Bet You Will," which invaded 
Library Walk on May 6 to record an 
upcoming episode. 

The television show, originally 
conceived in New York, dares people 
to do things in exchange for money. 

"You would be surprised at what 
people will do for money," said Peter 
Yango of MTY. "You never know 
what people will be addicted to next, 
but they are talking about this show. 
The early chatter around the box is 
that people are saying, 'I would have 
done that for less.' That's what this 
show is about." 

The day's first bet was taken by 
Thurgood Marshall College sopho-
more Jon Gore, who agreed to dump 
pudding in his pants for $60. At the 
time, only a small crowd of about 10 
people watched the stunt. However, 
soon there were over 100 people 
gathered around the taping. 

While some might question Gore 

for filling his britches with a dessert, 
he said it was well worth it. 

"It's a little wet and squishy," 
Gore said. "But hey, I just got 60 
bones for puddin' down my pants." 

The next bet pitted Marshall 
sophomore Jordan Meyer against 
Marshall freshman Mark Tate in a 
drinking contest. Rather than alco-
hol, the beverage involved was 
wheatgrass, a thick, green, healthy 
concoction. 

Whoever took the most shots of 
the substance without vomiting took 
the prize of $50. 

After 26 shots, Meyer couldn't 
stomach anymore and spit shot num-
ber 27 into the official "I Bet You 
Will" puke bucket. 

"[The wheatgrassl was awful," 
Meyer said. "It was all right at first, 
but it got really bitter. It stung me 
weird in the back of my throat. I've 
never had wheatgrass before. I can't 
imagine drinking it again the way I 
feel now." 

Tate took his $50 prize, but was 
tempted by the show's host, Morgan 
Spurlock, to try to down 10 more

Speech issues debated 
Koala again at center of forum 
By mVE LEHTONEN 
Senior Staff Writer 

The Unified Campus 
Coalition debated hate speech at 
its Tuesday night meeting, featur-
ing a panel of students discussing 
the issue and its relationship to 
the First Amendment. 

About 30 students attended 
the meeting in Center Hall Rm. 
109. Four student panelists repre-
sented different sides of the issue. 

One panelist was The KOII/a 
editor in chief George Liddle, 
who is involved in a Judicial 
Board process with UCSD 
regarding The Koala's alleged dis-
ruption of a November 2001 
MEChA meeting. 

Other panelists were Lance 
Miller, former president ofJewish 
fraternity AJpha Epsilon Pi; 
Catherine AJgeri, former A.S. 
commissioner of communica-
tions; and Robert Forouzandeh, 
president of the UCSD Freedom 
Alliance and vice chairman of the 
UCSD Conservative Union. 

Panelists responded to 
prewritten questions, as well as 
questions from the audience. 
Most questions and responses 
centered on the controversy sur-
rounding Tht KDaIa, and the stu-
dent periodical's printing of an 
article in November 2001 that 
spoke of a fictitious Jewish frater-

Budget woes hit Preuss 
School days may need to be cut 
By DANA WEST 
Senior Staff Writer 

Gov. Gray Davis' preliminary 
budget for 2002-2003 has indicat-
ed cuts in funding to The Preuss 
School, as well as to all UC out-
reach programs. 

The funding cuts will greatly 
decrease the annual $1 million 
allocation that represents about 
20 percent of the charter school's 
funds, according to Ann Briggs 
Addo, spokesperson for the 
UCSD Resource Management 
Office. 

"It will be a significant cut to 
the school and potentially to other 
funding sources of the school ," 
Addo said. 

The Preuss School is a charter 
school at UCSD that admits low-
income students who are histori-
cally underrepresented in the UC 

INSIDE ... 

system. 
With a $17 billion state 

deficit, K-12 and higher educa-
tion are seeing deep cuts. These 
cuts are $451 million from higher 
education and $487 million from 
K -12 education. Both cuts will 
hurt The Preuss School because 
it receives funding from UC out-
reach allocations and from tradi-
tional school funding, such as the 
annual days of attendance and 
property taxes. 

"Everything has a context, 
and if you're staring down the 
barrel at a $17 billion deficit, 
everybody is going to be hurt," 
Addo said . 

The Preuss School's stated 
mission since its inception has 
been to close the gap between 
underrepresented minorities and

Sun God 
without 
headliner 
Eight days 
left until 
annual fest 
By EDWU 
Senior Staff Writer 

With the yearly Sun God 
Festival looming barely a week 
away, the A.S. programming 
office has yet to finalize the line-
up of artists to perfonn May 17 
on RIMAC field . 

The festival has typically 
announced its music lineup 
anywhere from three weeks 
before the concert to during 
the week of the concert itself. 

The A.S. programming 
office said it has contracts out 
for negotiation, but it cannot 
release names until those con-
tracts are confirmed. So far, the 
only confirmed artist is under-
ground punk-rock band No 
Use For A Name, who are cur-
rently slated to play on the Vans 
Warped Tour this summer. 

UCSD alternative rock 
band Five Crown won yester-
day's Battle of the Bands and 
also will be playing at the festi-
val 

"Delays always happen . I 
am not worried because we 
have had worse situations in 
the previous years," sa id Eisha 
Christian, A.S . programmer 
for 2001-2002 . "I don't think 
we need any contingency plans 
because I am still very confi-
dent that we can have an awe-
some lineup. As with every 
year's Sun God lineup, it 
might not be our first choice 
- it rarely is." 

Christian said she plans to 
release finalized line-up on 
Monday, May 13 . 

Brandon Freeman, festivals 
coordinator for the A.S. pro-
gramming office, remains con-
fident that a roster will be in 
place soon. 

"We hope to have the lineup 
by [Wednesday] or Thursday," 
Freeman said. 

The programming office said 
it had rapper Ludacris con-
firmed in mid-March, but he

eight UC campuses as freshmen between fall 1998 
and fall 2000, and transfers from fall 2000 and fall 
2001. 

The study, titled 'The University of Califomia 
Undergraduate Experience Survey: will ask respon-
dents meeting the qualifications to reflect upon 
whether they feel they have made the most of the 
opportunities given to them at the University of 
Califomia. 

UC president Richard Atkinson will send e-mails 
to about 60,000 undergraduates in the system, 
informing them of the study and requesting their par-
ticipation to better assess the university's perfor-
mance. Instructions on how to access the online 
questionnaire will be sent within a few days of

Geffen gives UCLA largest 
donation ever to a meC:l school 

The UCLA School of Medicine has received $200 
million from David Geffen, the single largest dona-
tion ever given to a school of medicine. 

Gerald LfNY, provost for the medical sciences and 
dean of the UCLA School of Medicine, said he 
er.pects the gift to enhance the research capabilities 
and teaching programs of the school. 

The endowment will allow the school to retain 
and recruit better scientists, researchers and physi-
cians, LfNY said. The gift is also expected to allow the 
school to create new programs and initiatives. 

Geffen co-founded DreamWorks SKG, an enter-
tainment production company with Steven Speilberg 
and Jeffrey Katzenberg. 

The gift is the largest ever given in the histOlY of 
the University of California. 

The "Interim freshman senators appointed by college councils" misattribuRd the follow-
ing quote to Colin Parent: "Some members of the deputing council have nised concerns 
over a priority for me for the ten week term." The quote was mistakenly added in the edit-
ing process. The Gutlrditm regrets the error.

Speech: 
Koala's right to publish 
not the issue, some say 
Continued from .,... 1 
nity, "the Chikes," which is pro-
nounced as a derogatory term toward 
Jewish people. In the same issue, a 
quote in the personals read, "To all 
the Asians at this school: Nobody 
likes you. Go home." 

The panelists represented differ-
ent ideologies on hate speech, 
although all agreed that The KMI4 
had the constitutional right to print 
whatever it wanted. 

Forouzandeh was emphatic on 
this point. 

"I think that a lot of the time, 
people inistake racism with JUSt 
empty words," Forouzandeh said. "I 
want to make sure we distinguish 
what racism is and not detract from 
real racism, like discrimination and 
violence. When we put so much 
emphasis on words, we lose focus of 
the harmful things in society." 

AJge.ri felt that it was expedient 
that students and citizens on the 
whole examine the origins of dis-
crimination and violence. 

"There is a notion that humor 
isn't racism," she said. "I think you 
need to look at what kind of society 
discrimination comes from." 

Liddle, on the other hand, saw 
Tht KDal4's "Chikes" joke as benefi-
cial to the campus community. 

"I think one of the benefits of 
what we did was to show the 
hypocrisy of the school," Liddle said. 

Miller argued that while the 
speech is not illegal, it is violating to 
srudents and highly offensive. 

"I'm not sure if] would describe 
that speech as hate speech," Miller 
said. "I would say it is hateful 
speech." 

Students had mixed reactions to 
the event. Joanna Kahn, a Thurgood 
Marshal College freshman, was dis-
turbed by the joke. 

"It's distressing that when given 
the right to free speech, cenain peo-
ple would choose to use their right to 
belittle other minority groups," 
Kahn said. "You would think that 
there would be more support for 
groups who have been historically 
discriminated against: There is just 
so much hate." 

David Silverman, a Marshall 
fourth-year and an active member of 
AEPi, was concerned with the eco-
nomic side of things. 

"I think people are 'Changing the 
issue," Silverman said. "The issue 
is not whether hate speech is right 
or wrong, legally. The issue is the 
fact that students are forced to pay 
for the publication of hate speech. 
It's not like you can change the 
channel when you are paying the 
station money to air the program 
you find offensive and don't want 
to watch." 

Silverman was reacting in part to 
a comment made by Forouzandeh. 

"It is the right of every American 
to express the.ir point of view," 
Forouzandeh had said. "If you have a 
problem with Th, KDtUtI, don't read 
it. Write a letter to the editor. Do a 
demonstration. If you don't like the 
channel, change it." 

The "Hate vs. Free Speech" panel 
was part of a three-day event orga-
nized by the UCe. Monday night 
the group held a discussion on the 
issue of abortion, presenting author-
ities . from religious, biological and 
feminist perspectives. 

Wednesday night addressed the 
issue of affirmative action, with 
Forouzandeh rerurning, accompa-
nied by MEChA president Ernesto 
Martinez. 

UCC co-founder Brian Brook 
believed that the attendees, as well as 
all students, have a responsibility to 
unmask hard issues. 

"At a university, we have a duty to 
take on the tough issues," Brook said. 
"The goal of the VCC is to get past 
the rhetoric and to get to the heart of 
the issues." 

TIlE UCSD GUARDIAN NEWS 3 

Grazier fondly remembered by friends 
The smiling skier passed away on May 3 
By GEOFF DIETRICH 
News Editor 

UCSD student Matthew 
Grazier passed away at his home 
in Clairemont, Calif. on the 
morning of May 3. Friends 
remember him as an "awesome" 
and "brilliant" guy who always 
took time to listen to others and 
keep an open mind. 

The Earl Warren College 
student was 22 years old. 

"In conversations, he always 
wanted to know about you," said 
Grazier's house mate and friend 
Ben Rome. "If you only had a 
few minutes to talk, he wanted to 
know what was going on in your 
life." 

According to his friends, 
Grazier had an affinity for hav-
ing fun and..;" saving money. 
Friends recalled that the only 
beverage he would buy was beer 
- not sodas or juice - because 
water was always free. Instead of 
buying new things, the mechani-
cal engineering student could rig 
anything and everything to make 
it as good as new again, accord-
ing to Rome. 

"He loved to have fun," said 
Nick Silva, Grazier's friend since 
freshman year and housernate for 
the last two years. "He was 
always down to chill; and with a 
big smile." 

Grazier, who came from 
Clovis, Calif., was a skilled skier 
who rode mountains since he 
was 2-and-a-half years old, 
according to his mother, Cathy 
Grazier. He used to ski competi-
tively, often at nearby Sierra 
Summit, where he held a season 
pass while growing up. 

Friends fondly recalled a trip 

they made during wimer break 
to Aspen, Colo., as part of the 
UCSD Board club. Grazier 
reportedly got tired of skiing, so 
he ditched them to pick up a 
snowboard. No one could keep 
up with him, according to his 
friends. 

In addition to being a snow-
boarder, friends said Grazier was 
creative, staying up into the early 
hours of the morning making 

'If you only had a few 
minutes to talk, he 

wanted to know what 
was going on in you 

life.'

Housemate and friend of 
Grazier 

things in the backyard. 
"He had a massive brain for 

engineering," Rome said. 
Silva concurred, saying 

Grazier was "brilliant." 
In the past month, Grazier 

had begun to take a renewed 
interest in art, which he became 
interested in during high school. 
He had recently replaced the 
computer on his desk with paint-
ing materials. 

"He was super humble, mel-
low and down to earth," Silva 
said. 

Friends gathered Saturday 
night at La Jolla Shores beach 
for an impromptu bonfire in his 
remembrance. About 50 people 
showed up to remember their 
friend, who wasn't there to ask 

how their day was going. 
Friends say his smile kept 

coming up in conversation that 
night. 

The beach bonfire was also 
significant in that he surfed and 
bodyboarded, as well as skate-
boarded. ' 

"Matt was a risk-taker," his 
mother said, recalling stories of 
sky diving and dirt-biking with 
his dad Keith and brothers, Mike 
and Dave. 

Services are planned for May 
10 at II a.m. at the New 
Covenant Community Church, 
located at 1744 East Nees Ave. in 
Fresno, Calif. 

Grazier's vibrant smile will be 
missed the most, his friends say, 
but so will his altruistic nature. 

"He was always ready to lend 
a helping hand," Matt Prasek 
said.

Governor Davis: 
Leave Preuss 
School alone 

Anybody admitted to UCSD ought to 
understand a simple truism of budgeting: If 
you have less money coming in, you should 
have less money gomg out. 

In California, we've seen tills quite vividly 
in the past year; Gov. Gray Davis continues to 
propose budget cut after budget cut. Funds 
are being frozen, redirected and outright axed. 

Some of this is unavoidable. Some of it we 
have no choice but to live with. 

But some of it is just ridiculous. 
One of UCSD's most successful projects is 

the development of the Preuss School. A char-
ter school for yomh from underrepresented 
ethnic and racial groups and poorly perfonn-
ing feeder schools in San DIego, tile school 
attempts to give children a chance to attend 
high-powered universities such as UCSD - a 
chance they otherwise might not have. 

The Preuss School accomplishes this by 
hiring experienced and talented teachers, 
keeping class sizes below 30 students, extend-
ing the school year to over 200 days - the 
required year length by less than 190 - and 
extending the school day an extra hour. Such 
an operation costs money: In adclition to per-
pupil funds allocated br the state to all 
schools, the Preuss Schoo receives $1 million 
per year as a state budget line item. 

Or, it receieved this $1 million. 
Davis reduced this line item by $422,000 in 

next year's budget. This halving of the Preuss 
School's state funcling will cripple the school 
financially and prevent it from doing all the 
unique, and expensive, programs it operates 
that set it apan from other schools. There will 
no longer be an extended school year. The 
school day will be shonened. Other budgetary 
measures such as raising class size limits and 
cutting staff may be implemented. 

So who should care about this? Everyone 
should. 

The school has been wildly successful. 
Academic performance indexes and high 
school exit exam scores are well above those of 
the schools that Preuss School students would 
normally be attending (such as Crawford 
High School), and equaling or ~assing 

"privi l e~ed" schools such as Mutrlanos 
Middle ::,chool and La Jolla High School. 

Due to this success, the school has attract-
ed national attention and is a model for char-
ter schools being developed in other states. 

The Preuss School suggests that a major 
solution to California's - and indeed the 
nation's - education woes can be 'summed up 
in two words: more money. If you throw 
enough money at failing schools and spend it 
wisely, children will succeed no matter what 
race, ethnicity or class they "belong to." 

Davis has made no secret of the fact that he 
doesn't like chaner schools, but whether that's 
motivated by genuine personal ideoloS}' or a 
play for suppon from teachers' uruons is 
w1c1ear and Irrelevant. The Preuss School is a 
school that works, and works wonders. 

Although $422 ,000 is a drop in the buck-
et in California 's budget, it means the world 
to the children at the Preuss School. Davis 
ought to look elsewhere to do necessary 
buagetary trimming. 

May'we .suggest pay cuts for state govern-
ment bIgwigS?

Airing dirty laundry: Popular 
company reveals its ugly side 

Abercrombie & Fitch's decision to sell racist 
merchandise is unjust and in poor taste 

By ALEX .. LEE 
Senior Staff Writer 

Loolcing bacle, I can recall seeing a lot 
of half-naked men during my freshman 
year. They were everywhere in the 
dorms. Oddly enough, they all looleed 
the same. I'm sure this was all probably 
part of the appeal, however. 

The soulful look, those raging pecs, 
that chiseled jaw line - what could all 
these sexy traits share? The same white 
body for one thing, that and the fact that 
they are all signifiers of the mainstream 
definition of normality. OK, those naked 
guys weren't for real - only scattered 
Abercrombie & Fitch magazine clippings 
on the adoring walls of most female 
dorms - but they might as well have 
been. 

Abercrombie & Fitch is no stranger 
to controversy. In fact, it thrives o n it, 
which only makes its corporate agenda 
all the more insidious. It 's obvious that 
the company believes in the cliche of 
adverti si ng that any publicity, even the 
bad kind, is good publicity. Its most 
recent 15 minutes has confirmed what I 
had suspected about the company for 
years. 

For anyone out of the loop, a couple 
of weeks ago Abercrombie launched its 
clothing line campaign, one that it 
claimed "everyone would love, especially 
the Asian community." Apparently, 
someone at Abercrombie & Fitch 
thought tha t T-shirts with cartoon cari-
catures based on age-old racial stereo-
types that poked fun at Asian-Americans 
(with Stich catchy slogans as "Wong 
brothers laundry service: Two Wongs can 
make it white") would "add humor and 
levity to [thei r! fashion line." The images 
that complement these slogans are even 
less Aattering, drawing from a laundry 
list of racist ideologies that have plagued 
Asian-Americans si nce tl1eir arrival in 
this country as early as the mid - 19th cen-
nlry. 

So why am I so upset over some 

hannless T-shirts? According to many 
scholars, Abercrombie's campaign is just 
another example of an "ideological 
3SS2ult" toward people of color. Its abili-
ty to feign innocence and deny malicious 
intent speale of the enormous power that 
it has. Like most things, there is a prece-
dent for this. The propagation of images 
defining "the other" by a more powerful 
elite is a hallmark in the history of U .S. 
racial domination. If you dominate 
someone, you need to create stories to 
justify their oppression. This is where 
pop culture, the media - and yes, even 
clothing - all come into play. 

Hollywood has been instrumental in 

Abercrombie & Fitch is no 
stranger to controversy. In 

fact, they thrive on it, 
which only makes its 

corporate agenda all the 
more insididious. It's 

obvious that the company 
believes in the cliche of 

advertising that any 
publicitYr even the bad 
kind, is good publicity. 

exercising this power of ideology begin-
ning with the most popular form of 
entertainment during the 19th century, 
blackface minstrelsy. Asian-Americans 
have not been immune to an imposition 
of "otherness" by a Eurocentric oppres-
sor, either. One need look no further 
than landmark films such as D. W. 
Griffith's "Broken Blossoms" in whjch 
white actors in yellow-face act the part of 
the "inscrutable Asian," complete with 
buck teeth and slanted eyes. 

The neo-conservative milieu of the 
21st century hasn 't fared much better 

than decades past, despite most people's 
naiVe belief that we should now be a soci-
ety beyond racism. Just look at the pre-
ponderance of Jackie Chan films that 
echo the same "good" Asian qualities in 
its protagonists such as submissiveness, 
loyalty and lacl, of sexuality that Charlie 
Chan films achieved more than half a 
century earlier. 

Although the Civil Rights Movement 
made racism "illegal," new and covert 
forms have surfaced in itsplace that hide 
behind the politically correct rhetoric of 
color-blind liberalism. As a result, the 
image of the pot-bellied, southern rrd-
neck continues to persi st as the quintes-
sential racist, even tllough the well-edu-
cated, ignorant person in a suit is a more 
accurate depiction. 

The power of culnlre and the media 
cannot be underestimated. Advertising is 
particularly egregious. Then aga in , per-
haps Abercrombie & Fitch should be 
applauded for its honesty. Vvhil e othcr 
high-brow clothing lines are ofte n sub-
tler about their glorifica tion of white-
ness, Abercrombie & Fitch is at least 
completely open abour it. Indeed in its 
notoriously "soft -porn" catalogs the 
entire white body is worshipped. Of 
course, to be fai r, there is the token black 
guy - a shallow attempt at multicultur-
alism. 

The entire issue of Abercrombie fol -
lowing the bandw~gon of using exploita-
tive slave laoor - often from disenfran-
chised, poor immigrant labor from Asia 
and Latin America - is something r 
won't even bother to explore but is worth 
mentioning. 

History has shown time and again 
that racist ideologies have real -world 
consequences. Culture, although often 
deemed harmless, plays a pivotal ro le in 
circulating these unending discourses 
that pit Asian -Americans as "forever for-
eigners." Most would see T-shirts as an 
almost laughable si te on which to focus

Editor: 
There are a number of buzz-

words that get passed around the 
university: tolerance, hate, diver-
sity, unity. These are all noble 
things, but it seems that people 
have a hard time identifying them 
in real life. 

What is missing is an under-
standing of when to apply these 
principles. There is a time to tol-
erate, and a time to condemn. 
There is a time to hate, and a time 
to love. 

The past months have been 
filled with the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict, and that same conflict is 
being held here at UCSD . The 
war being fought is a war of 
words, rhetoric and public opin-
ion. 

The Jews have their "week" and 
the Muslims have their "week." 
Each side uses "buzzwords" to 
build itself lip and tear down its 
opponent. I am convinced they 
believe that truth is secondary to 
winning an argument. 

Words that are loaded with 
meaning are being used as weapons 
so much that now they are empty 
words. 

This kind of trend is subtle, 
dangerous and has no place at a 
university - a place where intellec-
tual thought is supposed to reign 
over rhetoric. 

The Muslim Student 
Association has crossed the bound-
ary and has stepped all over the 
truth in order further its goals. 
Every week it has set up its booth 
on Librar,' Walk promoting the 
ca use of the Palestinian people. 

Now they have gone too far. 
They have posted Palestinian pro-
paganda regarding a supposed 
"massacre" at Jenin. They accuse 

the Jews of running an a:>artheid . 
Both these accusations are with-
out merit and are simply ~ Iander­
ing the Jewish organiza. ion on 
campus. 

How is it possible that people 
take these accusations bghtly? 
These are serious charges that 
should only be made with ample 
evidence and a reasonable argu-
ment in support. Their only evi-
dence was the Palestinian propa-
ganda machine. 

The most recent estimate was 
that the Palestinians suffered only 
56 dead - mostly milItants with 
guns in their hands. The Israelis 
suffered 33 dead soldiers. 

The destruction seen on TV 
turned out to be a small area of 
Jenin where the battle raged 
between the militants and Israeli 
soldiers. This was to be expected of 
a battle rone. 

As these accusations were made 
in public, a public apology is in 
order from the Muslim Student 
Association. This was a prime 
example of hate and intolerance 
and for the most part has escaped 
people's arrention. 

Diversity of thought and opin-
ion is healthy, but lines need to be 
drawn. 

The rhetoric and propaganda 
need to stop; facts, not empty 
words, need to prevail.

"Saturday Night Live's" 
Lorne Michaels once said that 
comedy is "criticism with 
charm." Abercrombie certainly 
has followed sui t wi th this 
approach. The joke only works 
at the expense of a particular 
group, in this case, Asian-
Americans and ultimately all 
people of color. You begin to 
wonder if Abercrombie & Fitch 
would have known how offen-
sive its campaign was had it 
depicted the pickanninny 
stereotype of blacks, complete 
with watermelon and collard 
greens, on its shirts. 

Its "cute" depictions of 
Chinese launders smiling away on 
shirts plays on the early 20th cen-
tury stereotypes of Chinese 
immigrants who were restricted 
to domestic labor such as laun-
dries as a result of racist U.S. hir-
ing practices. 

Through a comedic play on 
revisionist history, it perpetu-
ates the false perception that 
Asian-Americans are "naturally" 
fitted for domestic labor and 
hopelessly unassimilable. This 
practice of essentializing 
nonessential qualitles onto 
immigrant groups continues 
today with Mexican migrant 
workers. 

As one of my professors 
pointed out, the Abercrombie 

Fighting fire with fire, the 
folks a t Blacldava have crea ted 
their own mock Abercrombie T-
shirts, complete with tongl.le-in -
cheek slogans such as 
"Artful bigotry & Kitsch: 
Ignorance, racism, excuses since 
2002." 

N evermind that Asian-
Americans were fundamental ro 
the growth of this nation as a 
crucial source of industrial labor 
during the U.S. expansion to the 
West . Nevermind that most 
Asi an-A meri can commun ities 
were shaped in large part by 
anti-immigration laws and U.S. 
government poli cies that 
throughout history ei ther 
explicitly or implicitly excluded 
them from the mainstream U.S. 
body politic. Abercrombie & 
Fitch certainly doesn 't give a 
damn. 

But none of us should be that 
surprised . ocial inequality is 
everywhere and race is but one 
aspect of it. 

Until people of color come 
together and real ize that thei r 
experiences are linked in the 
social construction of race in 
maintaining a hierarchy of power, 
racism will continue to hurt. And 
yes, even in clothing.

Office created to ensure 
fair treatment for students 
Burner to serve as first ombudsperson 
By COSINA MAR 
Contributing News Writer 

UCSD created the Office of the 
Om buds on April 22 in response to a 
request from a staff commission on 
diversity. The office is intended to to 
ensure that members of the UCSD 
community receive fair treatment in 
matters of concern or complaint and 
will provide informal, confidential 
counseling and evaluations on con-
flicted issues. 

According to Judith Bruner, the 
newly appointed campus 
ombudsperson, the office assists 
"people with concerns about acade-
mic or administrative issues and 
attempt to assist individuals to 
resolve their concerns fairly, and if 
possible, informally." 

The office exists as a supplement 
for formal agreement and procedure, 
so many of the services are offered 
confidentially. 

The Office of the Om buds will 
also refer clients to an appropriate 
office or person if he or she wants a 
problem to go on record. 

The ombudsman could also act as 
a mediator. According to Bruner, the 
mediator's main task is to ease the 
communications between the con-
flicted parties. 

Assista nt Chancellor Linda 
Williams, sees the O-ffice of the 
Ombuds as a testimony to 
UCSD's desire for everyone 
resolve conflic ts . 

"We have an additional place for 
people to go ... a unique, informal, 
problem-solving way," Williams said. 

Williams noted many obstacles 
that blocked the creation of such an 
organization before now. 

"There are lots of other agencies 
for resolving conflicts," Williams 
said. "Staff, students or faculty 
members might have utilized some 
other offices in the past to resolve 
their problem, such as judicial 
affairs for staff employment rela-
tions - academic affairs for stu-
dents. So there was no quick rush 
for (setting up the Ombudsl ." 

Williams also said researchers 
had been used to cover issues of the 
new office's structure, performing 
functions and collaboration with 
the other administrations. 

"(The Office of the Ombuds) is a 
safe place to come to asle for advice 
and evaluations," Bruner said. 

The new established Office of the 
Ombuds is located on the Thurgood 
Marshall College campus and can 
also be reached at (858) 534-0777. 

New ombudsperson: Judith Bruner will 
lead the new office at UCSD.

was that Min couldn't know what it

The show was originally con-

Spend all day at 
the Paci f ic Beach 
Block Party 
Proceeds from the day-
long festival to directly 
benefit the community 
By JESSICA KRUSKAMP 
Senior Staff Writer 

Get out of bed early for the Pacific Beach Block Party this Saturday. For 27 years the block party has 
al lowed Gamet Avenue in Pacific Beach 
to explode into a cacophony of vendors, 
enterta inment and locals. 

Tht: Paci fic Beach Communi ty 
Foundation organizes the all-ages event, 
whjch IS scheduled for May 11 from 9 
a. lI1 . to 6 p.m. Money generated from 
th iS year's parry directly benefits Pacific 
Beach and will be used for educa tion and 
philanthrop~' within the community. 

"It i - the biggest ')ne-day in the state," 
spokesperson Kevin Hellman said . "We 
are the biggest block party in the biggest 
space and draw the biggest crowd." 

Ilcllman has been involved with the 
PH Block Party for 10 years. Each year 
draw more people with new exhibits 
and activities, according to him. 

Running from Ingraham Street south 
to Mission Boulevard, the block party 
will offer a Kids Fun Zone, an interna-
tional food court, 400 vendors, inven-
tions, corporate sponsors and the music 
festival - 10 stages with 50 performers. 

"New for this year is the GNC pro 
performance arm wrestling competition," 
Hellman said. "People are excited about 
thjs; I have had call after call from people 
wanting to get in on it." 

The competition wi ll showcase pro-
fessional and amateur competitors and is 
scheduled from II a.m. to 4 p.m. 

Although we have left our childhood 
years behind, youthful behavior is still in 
the best of us. The Kid Zone, located on 
the 1500 block of Garnet, will not leave 
the child in all of us out of the festivities, 
according to Hellman . 

"There will be things for the adults 
and parents to play on," he said. 

In other words, prepare to take off 
your shoes and play with the kjds. 

The music festival rages all day long, 
with a varicty of music emanating from 
10 strategically placed stages. 

YOli don't have to migrate toward a 
stage to Ii tcn to the music. Street per-
f0n11ers, the Montgomery ffigh School 
Steel Drum Band, Tom Griesgraber and 
escape artist Michael Patrick will be work-
ing their way through the crowds during

'Midsummer Night's' promises to enchant and delight mortals 
The perennial favorite includes some new surprises but keeps the whimsical m~gic of Shakespeare 
By HANA HSU 
Staff Writer 

" Tht COUrrt of trut Iovt nrotr did 
,-un smooth" ... (1.1.134) 

Love: passionate, unrequited, 
foolish and magical - who hasn't 
experienced one such aspect in life? 
That's what makes us human . 
That's also what has made "A 
Midsummer Night's Dream" so 
appealing across the centuries. 

With its unique blend of fantasy, 
comedy and parody, "A Midsummer 
Night'S Dream" has been one of 
Shakespeares most celebrated plays. 
It is a whimsical look at the ups and 
downs of the mysterious thing called 

love, which affects both mortals and 
fairy meddlers alike. 

Now, under director Jim 
Winker, who is also a distinguished 
teacher and professional stage 
actor, UCSD brings the latest 
incarnation of thjs favorite to the 
Mandel Weiss Forum Theatre. 

Winker has added his own Ha-
vor, however. The past two cen-
turies have seen versions of "A 
Midsummer Night's Dream" rang-
ing from operas to circus-Like spec-
tacles to dark and violent visions. In 
keeping with the magical dreamlike 
quality of Shalcespeare's tCllt, 
Winker has favored a minimalist 
approach to both set design and dia-

logue. He has edited the play exten-
sively to reduce it to its essence. 

As dramaturge student Eric 
Bowling said, "Jim has gotten the 
heart of the dialogue - the sands 
and jewels out of it." 

In addition, Winker leaves most 
of the stage black for much of the 
play, thus leaving much to the audi-
ence's imagination. 

By downplaying the set, the fan-
tastical playfulness of the piece is 
highlighted. 

"Everything is created," Bowling 
said. "There's an elementa.l, tribal 
feel that comes through in the 
music, costumes and movement" 

For instance, there are 

Edwardian costumes for the mor-
tals, East Asian garb for the fairies 
and live music instead of a "canned" 
score. In fact, many "instruments" 
are found objects, such as pots and 
pans, which have been creatively 
adopted. Another unique, playful 
touch: If you happen to be a college 
latecomer, expect a special message 
straight &om the players on stage. 

For stage manarer Monica 
Cuoco, the pleasure 0 this produc-
tion comes from seeing Winker's 
energy and passion, as well as the 
26 undergraduate acton' chemistry 
and collaboration all meld into one 
great perfonnance. For Bowling, 
the satisfaction comes from seeing 

his research and Winker's playful-
ness and experience come through 
on the stage. 

"It's just such a magical show," 
said actress Sandra Ruiz. "We real-
ly work off the energy of the audi-
ence . (The actor who plays) 
Bottom changes his performance 
every night. And when the actors 
have fun, the audience has fun." 

It's the fun , the playfulness, the 
humor of the irrational, volatile 
game of love gone awry (but finally 
fixed) that carries the play. This 
weekend, celebrate the lunatic, the 
actor and the poet in you. Be a fool 
and fall in love with "A Midsummer 
Night's Dream."

Dave Matthews Band to play Coors C~eati.ng contemporary art 
Wildly popular jam band in San Diego on Monday With rice, pollen and nature 

By RUBY CHEN installments would have to be the 
By JESSICA LONG 
Staff Writer 

Dave Matthews Band has never been a typical band. It did not stan our as a group of friends 
who fanned a garage band in their 
teen years, only to find success after 
years of hard worle. Nor were they 
hand-picked by a producer for their 
talent and chemistry. 

Instead, Dave Matthews Band 
was fonned in 1991 when Dave 
Matthews decided to record some 
songs he had written . Wanting 
more than the sound of his guitar 
for accompaniment, he brought in 
other musicians to give his music 
more intensity. He enlisted Carter 
Beauford to play the drums, LeRoi 
Moore to play the saxophone, 
Stefan Lessard (who was only 16 
years old at the time) to play bass, 
Peter Griesar to play keyboard and 
Boyd Tinsley to play violin. More 
than a decade later, only Griesar is 
no longer playing with the band. 

Dave Matthews Band 's first 
public show was at the Earth Day 
Festival in Charlottesville, Va. in 
1991. To this day they are sti ll 
interested in helping save the envi-
ronment. This February, in a joint 
effort by Dave Matthews Band and 

hiatus 
() ~ I. I ~ I 

www.ucsdguardian .org 

Music Matters, Vermont-based 
ice cream company Ben and Jerry's 
released its newly created flavor 
called "One Sweet Whirled." The 
focus of this alliance is to cam-
paign against global wanning. 

Dave Matthews Band's first 
album, "Remember Two Things," 
was released in November of 1993 
on the Bama Rags label, and its 
fan base continued to spread, 
especially among college students. 
Seeing the growing popularity of 
the group, RCA released their 
next album, ·Under the Table and 
Dreaming," in September of 
1994. A year-and-a-half later, in 
April of 1996, "Crash" was 
released on the RCA label. The 
next Dave Matthews Band album, 
"Before These Crowded Streets," 
was released in April of 1998 on 
the RCA label. The latest album, 
"Everyday," was released in 
February of 2001 with the help of 
legendary producer Glen Ballard. 

However, this latest album 
forced Dave Matthews Band to 
put aside the songs that Steve 
Lillywhite produced in 2000. 
While this collection has been 
called "the Lillywhite sessions" for 
two years now, these songs will be 
released on July 16th under the 

title "Busted Stuff." The first sin-
gle, titled "Where are you going," 
is featured in the upcoming Adam 
Sandler movie "Mr. Deeds." 

It may appear that Dave 
Matthews Band is a band that 
prefers to spend its time in the stu-
dio rather than on stage, but noth-
ing could be farther ITom the truth. 
From its first official tour in 1994 to 
the present day, the band has been 
playing to sold-out crowds across 
North America and Europe. 

The appeal of its live perfor-
mances has not been lost on the 
band or their record labels. Barna 
RagsIRCA have released four dou-
ble-disc recordings of live shows. 
"Live at Red Rock 8-15-95" 
(1997), "Live at Luther College: 
An Acoustic Pe.rformance by Dave 
Matthews and Tim Reynolds" 
(1999), "Listener Supported" 
(1999) and "Live in Chicago 12-
19-98 at the United Center" 
(1999) all went platinum with no 
promotion or marketing. 

San Diego has a chance to see 
this amazing band live at Coors 
Amphitheater at 7 p.m. on May 13, 
but only if you already have tickets. 
Dave Matthews Band will play to a 
sold-out crowd of 20,000 with 
Gov't Mule as its opening acr. 

Contributing Staff Writer "Milkstone (1983-87)" exhibit 
where a four-by-four thin slab of 
white marble is coated with three 
quarts of imported European par-
malet milk to give the illusion of a 
solid object. This piece is so capti-
vating because it presents such a 
paradox. 

Think about what you can do with rice. Well, obviously you can cook and eat it. You can 
throw it at newlyweds as a celebrato-
ry gesture and you can use it as stuff-
ing in beanbag chairs and stuffed 
animals. But who would have ever 
thought of using rice artistically to 
make a statement about the sheer 
simplicity and beauty of nature? 

This is exactly what Gennan 
artist Wolfgang Laib uses, along 
with beeswax. pollen, white marble, 
mille and other ordinary materials, to 
explore the spirituality of everyday 
common objects. The first major 
American survey of Laib's worle, 
"Wolfgang Laib: A Retrospective," 
is currendyon view through May 19 
at the San Diego Museum of 
Contemporary Art in La Jolla. 

Displayed in the beautiful 
Krichman Family Gallery, where 
four straight window panels directly 
overlook the Pacific Ocean, the 
whole room epitomizes serenity and 
simplicity. 

Ironically, the seemingly 
straightforward piece of artwork is 
more complicated than it appears. A 
slight concave depression is made 
on the surface of the marble to hold 
the milk. Laib does the initial ritual-
istic pouring of the milk into the 
hollow and thereafter throughout 
the duration of the exhibit, the 
museum staff takes responsibility of 
emptying the milk, cleaning the 
marble and refilling it the next 
morning. Such intricate measures 
are taken every single day to ensure 
the quality of the presentation. 

Web-exclusive stories 

The 24 sculptures and install-
ments on view at the museum fuse 
influences from Asian, Indian, 
Islamic, Tibetan, Egyptian and 
Mesopotamian cultures to create 
original works of art that draw on 
universal signs and natural materials. 
His love of rice stems from Islamic 
cemeteries where rice is seen as a Ii t-
eral symbol of nourishment and is 
used as a symbolic substitute for 
bones. Beeswax is also a favorite of 
Laib. He is able to use beeswax and 
wood to create life-size chambers of 
"ships" that are illuminated by bare 
lightbulbs hanging from the ceiling. 

Whether you are an an buff, 
this is certainly one exhibit that 
deserves attention . Laib employs 
simple designs and materials in his 
work to show a deep spiritual rela-
tionship with nature. His install-
ments emphasize the beauty, purity, 
tranquillity and simplicity of organ-
ic elements as each individual object 
is drastically different ITom the next.

Other than these "ships," the 
exhibit also includes two 12-by-12 
beeswax ziggurats on wood that arc 
inspired by the structure of Tibetan 
monasteries. 

Besides the usage of rice and 
beeswax, the most intriguing of all

This weekend the Tritons send

The Tritons will face stiff competi-

intimidated. 

"We want to be a national pow-

The UCSD softball team 
received some respect from the

The Tritons will face familiar 

CCAA foe Cal Sute Bakersfield 
May 9 at II :45 a.m. at UC Davis' 
LaRue Field. The two teams split 
their four regular-season meetings, 
each team winning two games. 

The winner will advance to play 
the winner between No. 2 seed 
Western New Mexico (against 
which UCSD is 1-3) or fifth-seed-
ed Chico State University (against 
which UCSD is 3-2). 

The regional winner will 
advance to the NCAA Division U 
Championships, held May 16 to 
May 20 at the James I. Moyer 
Sports Complex in Salem, Va. 

"We came ill 13th last year 
and we were trying to improve 
on that, and we didn't," 
Pinlcerton said. 

I'm proud of my guys." 
The rest of the UCSD team fin-

ished with some success as well, led by 
the novice-eight boat. Splitting two 
prior races with OCC this season, the 
novice-eight boat finished in second 
place behind the rival school. 

the weekend was the results of 
the novice-four race, which 
Pinlcerton had held high hopes 
for going into the competition. 

In its heat, the varsity open-
eight boat finished fifth in 
7 :46. The crew improved for 
its final, however, coll)ing in 
second behind Lewis and 
Clark College with 7:41 - a 
five-second improvement. 

In the men's novice-lightweight-four 
6nal race, the Tritons made the finals and 
finished in sixth place out of 18 crews. 

The second novice-eight boat, like 
the first novice-eight, had been bat-
ding oce all year long. A good start 
for the Tritons was wasted when the 
sliding mechanism on the boat broke, 
putting the UCSD men out of con-
tention and allowing acc to win 
another race. 

Rounding out the weekend, the varsi-
ty-four boat didn't make the finals and 
came in 15th out of 18 crews in the field. 

"This was our first race as a [boat 
oij four," said sophomore David Koch-
Weser. "We're definitely improving, 

See NATIONALS. Page '4 

The first heat went well for 
the crew, which finished sec-
ond in 8:05, only four seconds 
behind Loyola Marymount 
University. 

In the final, however, the 
Tritons lost an oar and went 
off course as a result. The crew 
quiclcly recovered, but was still 
only able to finish fifth with a 
final time of 8:00. 

"They did a heroic job get-
ting back into the course," 
Pinkerton said. 

The race "was a real heart-
breaker," especially because 
UCSD was the defending 
champion of that category, 
Pinkerton said. 

The varsity-eight crew also 
had trouble meeting its expec-
tations. 

But the team's improve-
ment still only landed it 14th 
overall - not enough to 
improve upon last year. 

Pinlcerton noted that the 
boat's top two heavyweight 
rowers, Amber Hopkins and 
Jennifer Wolsborn, were back 
in competi tion for the first 
time after recovering from 
pneumonia and back problems, 
respectively. Brooke Albiston 
was also back after taking over 
a week off to heal a rib injury. 

"The boat just didn't have 
the confidence when you have 
the same people all the time," 
Pinkerton said. 

One crew that was able to 
improve in its final was the

strikeouts in the ninth. 

UCSD third baseman Matt 
Merrifield doubled with two outs in 
the bottom of the second and then 
scored when senior second base-
man Anthony Lococo singled up 
the middle. In the fourth, Jeff 
Riddle singled to center and 
Sullivan singled through the right 
side. Both would score later that 
inning, with Sullivan's run coming 
on a wild pitch by Panther hurler 
Clint Blevins. 

Leading 4-2 heading into the 
bottom of the seventh inning, 
UCSD rallied more offense and put 
three additional runs on the board. 

Sullivan led off the inning with a 
walk, and then Merrifield reached 
on a fielder's choice . Brandon 
Walker pinch-ran for Merrifield 
and advanced to second on a wild 
pitch just before Lococo walked. 

After O'Brien inserted Garret 
Riddle to pinch-hit for right fielder 
David Hawk and Nigel Miller to 
pinch-run for Lococo, a Garret 
Riddle single through the right side 
drove in Walker on the play. Brett 
Burton then pinch ran for Garret 
Riddle and advanced to second on a 
wild pitch while Miller scored. 
Freshman shortstop Keith 
Hernandez singled to right field 
and scored Burton. 

Chapman tried to mount a 
comebaCk in the top of the eighth 
when designated hitter Enrique 
Heredia and catcher Matt Graves 
drew walks in the beginning of the 
inning. Panther third baseman 
Jason Miller also walked and loaded 
the bases for pinch hitter Elmer 
Roldan, who singled down the left 
field line and drove in Heredia and 
Graves for two runs.

However, the Tritons closed out 
the game ill the bottom of the 
eighth and put up an additional 
insurance run after Smith scored 
off of a Sullivan single. 

Smith, Jeff Riddle, Sullivan, 
Merrifield and Lococo had two 
hits apiece in the victory for 
UCSD. Senior first baseman 
Chad Addison also notched one 
hit. 

Panther SCOtt Akamine gOt the 
loss for Chapman and falls to 6-3 
on the year. 

Panther right fielder C.j. 
Castillo went 3 -for-3 on the day, 
while Heredia, Graves, left fielder 
Jeff Levering, pinch hitter Travis 
Otott and Roldan each had one. 

After a 14-34 start in Division II 
last year and a predicted 10m-place 
finish in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association preseason poll 
this year, UCSD's fifth-place finish 
in the 2002 season is all the more 
impressive. 

"[ think to get respect in any 
poll, you need to establish your-
self, and that's why I'm so proud 
of this team," O'Brien said . "It's a 
team I will never forget because 
it's a team that put UCSD base-
ball legitimately on the baseball 
map." 

With the victory, the Tritons 
improve to 30-23-1 overall - the 
first time UCSD baseba ll has 
earned 30 wins since 1994 when 
head coach Dan O'Brien was a 
junior tirst baseman for the 
Tritons. 

However, the Triton team will 
be hurting next year because nine 
seniors from the team are slated to 
graduate this June. 

"We are undoubtedly going to 
take a hit," O'Brien said. "Three of 
our starting pitchers are graduat-
ing, and you potentially lose your 
entire pitching staff, along with 
some infielders, but we've had a 
great recruiting year and we have a 
great returning ball club."

Softball earns 
respect, third seed 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Sports Editor 

As the postseason heats up, the 
~takes become bigger and the mar-
I!IIl for error becomes smaller. T he 
L'CS D golf team started the postsea-
'Illl un the wrong foot. T he women 's 
'enrus team looked to take a step 
toward the national champIOnship, 
and the Triton softball team was 
happy to find a foot in the door at all . 

At the Estrella Mountain Golf 
Ra nch in Goodyear, Ariz., the 
UCSD golf team had a slow start to 
the CAA Division II Men's Golf 
West Super Regional. 

The Tritons shot 304 on Monday 
JS a tcam, placing them in eighth 
pbce, 20 strokes behind leader UC 
Davis. Brian Duckworth led the 
Tritons, finishing tied for eighth 
with an even-par score of 72 . 
UC D's Alan Scheer hit a 13 to fin-
ish tied for 14th, while Ryan Gale, 
G reg Wilson and Eugene Itkin 
rounded out the rest of UCSD's five , 
shooting 78, 81 and 81 respectively. 

The second day saw UCSD jump 
up in the standings from eighth to 
seventh, displaci ng St. Martin 's 
College. But the Tritons till fell to 
30 strokes behind leader UC Davis. 

Firing a 302 team score in the 
second round, Duckworth again 
led UCSD, shooting a 73 to finish 
tied for sixth-lowest score. Scheer 
ended up tied for 20th with a 75 . 
Gale, Wilson and Itkin respectively 
tinished 35 th, 41st and 45th.

Triton boats gear up for Division II playoffs 
Men send two boats to nationals, women four to regionals

Team unity: The women's crew team, shown here competing in the San Diego Crew Classic earlier this year, is sending two varsity-eight boats, a lightweight-eight 
crew and a novice-four boat to Sacramento for the Pacific Coast Division II Regional Championships. 

By CARRIE ELIZABETH SKLAR 
Senior Staff Writer 

Despite high hopes set at the 
Miller Cup, UCSD women's crew 
failed to bring home any medals 
last weekend at the Western 
Intercollegiate Rowing 
Association championships in 
Lake Natoma, Calif. 

In a field of 30 mainly Division 
I colleges and universities, the 
Tritons were able to send five 
boats to final rounds. 

"We lacked consistency and we 
under-performed in some cases," 
said head coach Pattie Pinkerton. 

According to Pinkerton, one 
of the most notable examples of 
this was the varsity-four boat. 

In its first heat, the crew was 
among the top four in what 

proved to be an extremely close 
race, with the first four finishers 
all ending within one meter of 
each other. St. Mary'S College and 
University of Puget Sound both 
finished with a time of 8:22.4, and 
Gonzaga University came in at 
8:22.9. The Tritons finished just 
behind with a time of 8:23.3. 

However, the close race left 
the crew tied for the final, and 
UCSD's time fell to 9:02 for a 
fifth-place finish. Though it was 
enough to win the petit final, the 
time disparity was a letdown for 
the team. 

"That was a race where J was 
really disappointed with our con-
sistency," Pinkerton said. 

But the biggest heartbreak of

It was the story of their season: 
UCSD men's crew went to the 
Western Intercollegiate Rowing 
Association Championships at 
Lake Natoma in Sacramento last 
weekend looking to shock the 
crew world. Shock people they 
didn't, but the Tritons did return 
to San Diego with a respectable 
finish and high hopes for the 
future. 

UCSD went into the varsity 
race knowing that it would be 
very competitive. 

"I took a little bit of a chance," 
said UCSD coach Michael 
Filippone. "I knew Orange Coast 
College was really fast and I told 
the crew to be extra aggressive for 

the first 1,000 meters lof the 
2,OOO-meter race] ." 

The Tritons kept up with the 
leaders for the first 1,000 meters. 
But then they began to ti re , and 
the better crews pulled ahead . 

"This was one of the fastest 
races we've been in this Yf:ar," said 
senior Brian Sullivan. "We had a 
slow second 2,000 meters. We 
might have gotten fourth , but we 
never made a move on Puget 
Sound [which finished fourth] ." 

As it was, the Tritons came in 
fifth , which didn't disappoint 
Filippone. 

"This was the most competi-
tive event we've been in this 
year," he said. "Some crews didn 't 
even enter the varsity-eight event.

Baseball ends surprising year on a winning note 
After falling just short of playoffs, Tritons beat up Chapman 
By COURTNEY FIELD 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD baseball team 
played its last game of the 2002 
season Tuesday at home against 
Chapman University after return-
ing from its final regular season 
series last weekend in Davis, 
Calif. 

The Tritons lost the final game 
of the four-game series against the 
UC Davis Aggies, leaving UCSD 
just one game shy of clinching a 
playoff berth. 

After struggling through six 
innings of play without a run, the 
Tritons scored once in the sev-
enth and once in the ninth, but 
by then, UCSD was too far 
behind to come back. The 
Tritons finished with 11 hits in 
the game, but were hurt by their 
failure to convert many key 
opportunities. 

UCSD lost the game to the 
Aggies 5 -2 in the series closer 
and saw its playoff hopes slip 
away. 

"The loss was disappointing 
because we expected to win, but 
we went out there and beat two 
legitimate pitchers with our back 
agai nst the wall in game three," 

said UCSD head coach Dan 
O'Brien. "It was a must-win situ-
ation, and we beat arguably the 
best pitcher in the league [Aggie 
Greg Bruso]. [Bruso] had won 
nine consecutive games, [and that 
win] took us to Sunday. We don't 
feel like we played weil on 
Sunday, but it will just . motivate 
us to be hungry for next year." 

Triton pitcher Andy Hanau 
picked up the loss for UCSD and 
falls to 3 -5 on the year. 
Designated hitter Jeff Riddle and 
center fielder Matt Smith had two 
knocks apiece for the Tritons in 
the loss. 

UC Davis' Trevor Thornton 
earned the win for the Aggies, 
tossing eight and one-third 
innings en route to improving to 
5-2, while closer Dave McKae 
picked up his sixth win of the 
year. 

Aggie shortstop Ryan Coultas 
had three hits in the winning 
effort, while third baseman Matt 
Kamigawachi, first baseman 
Dennis Flippen, left fielder 
Shaun McCullough and catcher 
Andrew Reisinger had two hits 
apiece. 

UCSD returned to Triton 
Baseball Stadium in high fashion 

where it played well and beat 
Division III powerhouse Chapman 
University 8-4 in the last game of 
the season. 

All nine Triton seniors were 
honored before the first pitch on 
Senior Day for their contributions 
to the UCSD baseball program. 

Triton pitcher James Sanders 
took a hiatus from his usual clos-
ing duties, got his first start of the 

season, and picked up the win 
when he improved to 3-1 on the 
year. Seniors John Schultz, Robert 
Peelle and John Beaven pitched in 
the victory, along with Raf 
Bergstrom and Tommy Sereno. 
Alexander Cremidan took over the 
closer role to shut down the
