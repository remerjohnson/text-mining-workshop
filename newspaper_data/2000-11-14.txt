Hillel Seeks to Buy 
Vacant UCSD Lot 
Jewish student organization'S plans meet 
opposition from La Jolla residents 
By KYLE BIEBES-.EIMER 
Staff Writer 

For many UCSD students, the 
ability to practice their religion 
and affiliate with those that share 
their beliefs is a righ t often taken 
for granted. 

UCSD Catholics, Lutherans, 
and Mormons each have facilities 
located on the fringe of campus 
where they can associate with 
those of their faith . While not the 
largest facilities, each group does 
have a building where they can 
practice their religion. 

The University Lutheran 
Church on La Jolla Shores Road 
is shared by the Catholics and 
the Lutheran student groups. 

Jewish students, however, are 
not as fortunate. 

Hillel. UCSD's Jewish organi-
zation, 'shares an office with five 
other ministries on campus in 
the Office of Religious Affairs. 

In addition, the members of 
Hillel said the office and its lack 
of private space hampers the 
practice of the Jewish religion on 
campus. 

"The Jewish students need a 
quiet retreat to have access to 
education and religion in a facili-
ty they can 'call their own: said 
Neal Singer, vice president of the 
UCSD chapter. "Because they 
don't have a facility of their own, 
they can't have a kosher kitchen, 
which is required: 

Singer believes Jewish stu-
dents at UCSD should have the 
same opportunities for religious 
exercise as other groups. 

"Hillel is an organization that 
has facilities on hundreds of 
campuses across the country." 
Singer said. "In fact, all the other 
UC campuses - namely Berke-
ley, UCLA and Santa Barbara -
have Hillel facilities in proximity 

to campus: 
In order to alleviate this prob-

lem, Hillel began an extensive 
search in 1997 for an off-campus 
location to build a Jewish student 
center within walking distance of 
ampus. 

Hillel felt they had fou nd 
such a location when they dis-
covered a small, undeveloped 
piece of land situated at the cor-
ner of La Jolla Village Drive and 
La Jolla Scenic Drive. 

However, Hillel was forced to 
battle with residents who did not 
want development in their neigh-
borhood over this new 15,000 
square foot , city-owned piece of 
property. 

Many of the residents around 
this area were vehemently 
opposed to the construction of a 
center on this lot, as it violates 
the city zoning laws that were 
established to protect homeown-
ers from various forms of devel-
opment. 

"Our problem is that this is a 
land-use issue." said Penelope 
Bourk, a five-year resident of La 
Jolla who owns one of several 
homes in this area. "If Hillel goes 
here, and spot zoning is against 
the law, then lanyl house could 
easily be razed for, say, a Catholic 
institution." 

Spot zoning occurs when 
there is a substantial difference 
between two properties that are 
in close vicinity of each other. 

Bourk said that the structure 
Hillel supports would exemplify 
illegal spot zoning, and would 
also set a bad example for homes 
surrounding the neighborhood. _ 

"If somebody wanted to 
build an institution on the other 
side of ILa Jolla Village Drivel 
amongst other institutions, that

"It all comes down to money." 
said Santi Soumpholphakdy, a

minorities are there and how many

UCSD community gives opinions about best blueprints for campus transportation 

Senior Stsff Writer 

The: Metropolitan Transit 
Development Board of San Diego 
discussed possible locations for a 
trolley station on the UCSD cam-
pus at their board meeting on 
Thursday. 

There are currently 11 possible 
sites for a trolley station in five dif-
feren t areas of the campus, all of 
which are still under evaluation 
and were discussed at the mc:c:ting. 

The first option, alignment A, 
would place a station near the Vet-
eran's Affairs Medical Center. 

Alignment B would stop on the 

East side of campus in front of 
Thornton Hospital. 

The third "family" of options 
includes C-l, which would stop at 
both the VA Medical Center and 
Thornton Hospital, and option C-
2, which would include the same 
stations as C-1 in addition to the 
construction of a tunnel and aeri-
al alignment. 

The D family of choices 
includes four different ways to 
reach the Price Center, with vari-
ous alternatives, including the 
construction of a tunnel or aerial 
alignment. 

Plans E-l, E-2 and E-3 would 
traverse through Pepper Canyon, 

via the VA Medical Center. 
Lastly, alignment F would stop 

at Gilman Drive near the UCSD 
Medicat Center, made possible by 
the construction of a tunnel under 
the West campus returning to the 
street level at the Thornton Hospi-
tal station. This alternative would 
be achieved through the use of a 
tunnel option including a stop on 
La Jolla Village Lane . . 

The meeting was open to the 
public, and several members of the 
UCSD community spoke on 
behalf of the student body. 

UCSD alumnus Ben Smith, 
who was on the campus planning 
committee last year, suggested a 

careful reconsideration of the D-4 
or F plans, which would not only be 
close to the Price Center, but to 
Giesel Library, Mandeville Auditori-
um and seve raJ lecture halls. He 
added that a station near East park-
ing would not offer a better option 
to students than driving because it 
would require a shuttle service to 
reach the center of campus. 

Smith conducted a survey over 
four days in May 1999 on behalf 
of the A.S. Council. The survey of 
2 percent of the student body 
resulted in the approval of two 
possible station sites on the west

Hillel: 
Homeowners feel their 
rights would be violated 
Continued from ..... 1 
wouldn't be Spot zoning: she said . 
"But if somebody should get a per-
mit to build here on this property, 
and it's not clearly distinguishable 
from the property next door, then 
whatever applied to that property 
could apply to Ineighboringl proper-
ties." 

Neighboring residents feel that 
doing this would establish a precedent 
for the city and the La Jolla High-
landers Homeowners. 

"If IHillel] can get a conditional use 
permit for a student cen ter even 
though there should be no provision 
for that in land use zoning, then we 
have not been told by anyone why all 
of these houses couldn't become 
essentially an extension of the univer-
sity: Bourk said. 

Although Bourk and her neighbors 
understand the need for organizations 
such as Hillel to expand and build 
permanent structures of their own, 
they are simply opposed to doing it in 
ways that violate their rights as home-
owners. 

Instead, Bourk and others have 
encouraged Hillel to search for alter-
native locations like the eastern 
periphery of campus, where home-
owners are less likely to be disturbed 
and where new developments are con-
stantly sprouting up. 

However, disagreement and resent-
ment have risen over this issue. 

"We can't go someplace else," 
Singer said. "We have made an 
exhaustive search of all the property 
around UCSD that would be avai lable 
for something like this. If we built 
something on the eas t side of campus, 
or someplace that wasn't within 
immediate walking distance, it would 
go unused and our money would be 
thrown away." , 

Singer also refutes Bourk's charge 
that the proposed Hillel student cen-
ter would violare existing zoning regu-
lations for the area. 

"If you look at the 1975 communi-
ty plan, it says specifically that this 
parcel is owned outright by the city 
and may be disposed of or used as the 
city council deems appropriate," he 
said. 

Singer feels that Hillel should be 
able to have the space because it has 
been vacant for 35 years. 

"Here's an asset of the city that has 
not produced a single penny of 
income for over 30 years," Singer said. 
"Now IHillell comes in and says we're 
offering to pay over half a million dol-
lars for this piece of property, which 
benefits all the people of San Diego, 
not just the select few that are whining 
about it." 

Whatever the outcome of this 
struggle between La )olla Highlands 
Homeowners, the City of San Diego, 
and Hillel, one thing remains certain: 
As long as religious institutions are 
prevented from building permanent 
structures on campus, they will be 
forced to venture out into the neigh-
boring community in search of their 
own structure. 

This leaves homeowners to defend 
their community from disruptions 
Ihat they feel will change the status 
quo of their peaceful streets and 
homes.

Our campus should remain committed to aaulemic 
excellence in order to improve. and increase the 
school's recognition 

Contributlrw Opinion Writer 

Ever since I arrived at UCSD 
last year, I have heard continuous 
complaints about our school's lack 
of a football team or its Division II 
sports teams. Many people think 
we should have at least a football 
team and make our Division " 
sport teams more competitive so 
they can become Division I teams. 
These people often refer to UC 
Berkeley or UCLA's football and 
basketball teams as model teams 
that UCSD should have or emu-
late. 

I believe otherwise. I like our 
school'S present focus on acade-
mics instead of sports. Notice I am 
not against having many sports 
teams, or even trying to make our 
present sport teams better. Howev-
er, I am convinced that UCSD 
needs to k.eep its academic focus in 
order to fulfill its role as a universi-
ty. 

A university is typically defmed 
as an institution of higher learning. 
For a university to focus more on 
sports instead of academics is to bit . 
inconsistent with a university'. 
function. The ckfinition usually 

does not mention spons. Based on 
the previous definiti0::-rl 
respecta6le instituifon that

It is perfectly acceptable for a 
university to have teams in every 
conceivable sport. I personally sup-
port sports and anything that 
advances sports to a higher level. 

How~er, I believe sports should 
remam only as extracurricular 
activities in universities, and noth-
ing more. 
. Some might say collegiate 
sports are very important \)(cause 
they he.lp prepare athletes for pro-
fessional sports. If so, people 
should create organizations 
expressly to train and provide assis-
tance for aspiring athletes. Athletes 
should not look toward universities 
as stepping stones to professional 
sports, nor should they make 
s!'?rts their primary reason for

Booksar. 
not Worth 
the Hype 

Stop 
ThRt! 

BERTRAND FAN 

I just finished a book, and I've 
been playing around with this idea 
in my head for a while: I like the 
universality of books. I think that's 
one of their most redeeming fea-
tures. They've got a few other ben-
efits, too: They're portable (you can 
pretty much bring them anywhere), 
and you can drop them in a swim-
ming pool, and with a little bit of 
effort, still read them. I've tried. But 
at the same time, they've got a lot of 
downsides. 

First of all. they take a hell of a 
long time to finish . To give you an 
example, the book I just finished 
was 323 pages long, and I've been 
reading it on and off throughout 
the day. In fact , if I were to break 
my day down, that's all I really did 
today, suffice rather routine things 
like having lunch. 

Somewhere in my earlier 
schooling they implanted the idea 
in my head that the novel was 
invented as a kind of book that 
was meant to be finished in an 
evening. This, I've come to discov-
er, is complete crap - a fairy tale 
invented by one English teacher 
and passed down through genera:-
tions and generations of lying 
English teachers. 

Imagine the time period sur-
rounding the instance when the 
novel was created: People went to 
bed at 7 p.m. because it got dark. 
Conversations around that time 
were quite similar to this: 

"Hey, Ebenezer. looks like the 
sun just set." 

"I guess we're screwed now. Off 
to bed we go: 

Considering they had tea at 3 
p.m. and supper at 5 p.m., that 
leaves about two hours to consti-
tute their "evening." And anyone 
who finishes novels in less than 
two hours is either: a.) A speed 
reader. b.) Reading Hardy Boys / 
Nancy Drew joint mystery capers 
- a fine collection I might add. c.) 
A damned liar, much like English 
teachers who claim novels were 
meant to be finished in an evening. 

Another problem with books is 
the whole "you should be reading 
them" stigma attached to them. It's 
almost the same as when you were 
younger and your parents said, "It's 
such a wonderful day outside. you 
should be out enjoying that instead 
~f inside the house." The sugges-
lion was much more than a veilt:d 
excuse for your parents to have sex. 
It's a statement designed to make 
you feel bad about watching MTY, 
playing video games and not allow-
ing your parents to have sex. 

The "you should be reading 
them" stigma rears its ugly head 
later in your life, unless you're a 
nerd like my sister, and actually list 
reading books as what you would 
do if you were bored in a pseudo-

\)(cause you're going through life 
without really reading any books, 
or if you are reading books, you're 
not reading the really good books, 
just the trashy ones. 

But I seem to have gotten off my 
main point, which was that I liked 
the universality of books. In other 
words, I could read a book in San

The VCSD Guardian OPINION 5 

Political Activity Leaves Much to be Desired 
Despite the excitement surrounding elections, students are not active 
By PAIINAZ TAHIIII 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Election year 2000 will 
undoubtedly go down in the his-
tory books as one of the most 
complicated and controversial 
elections in U.S. history. For many 
students here at UCSD, this 
unforgettable election year has 
been their very first, and quite 
possibly, the most memorable they 
will ever have. 

All of this considered, it is sad 
to say that for other students at 
UCSD, voting and knowing who 
leads their country is as unimpor-
tant and petty as their 8 a.m. class-
es. From what I have observed 
before and after the days of the 
Tuesday vote, political awareness 
and spirit here on campus are 
lacking in every possible way. 

While there are those who pre-
sent a strong passion and interest 
in the elections and the candi-
dates, there is also a majority who 
view them to be a waste of their 
time, and are completely ignorant 
when it comes to the candidates' 
names and the positions they are 
running for. 

It is evident that times have 

changed since the 1960s, when 
political protests, rallies and 
strik.es were a common activity on 
colh:ge campuses, and when the 
voice of students counted as much 
as anything else in politics. 

Today we are living in the new 
millennium, and attending one of 
the most prominent schools in the 
country. The students, as a way of 
showing political spirit and sup-
port, did not even hold one large 

and preach their political views? 
Where are the spirited groups that 
give out stickers and American 
flags and tell passersby to vote for 
the person who they passionately 
believe to be right for our coun-
try? Unfortunately, those people 
do not exist here on this campus 
and, if they do, something is stop-
ping them from showing their 
motivation and determination to 
stand up. 

This past election was the first of the millennium, 
not to mention the first election that many UCSD 
students had the opportunity to participate in. 
Unfortunately, it turned out to be a bore on campus. 
political rally or campaign. Sure, 
there were a few crumpled-up and 
slanted campaign signs stating 
"Bush-Cheney" or "Gore-Lieber-
man" hung on posts, but this is a 
university full of young, educated 
students and future leaders of our 
country. Hanging signs on posts is 
not going to get any ideas across 
to anyone. 

So where are the hardcore 
activists who stand up on stage 

The problem of voting on 
campus also contributes to the 
lack of political involvement and 
awareness. There were those who 
did vote and proved their com-
mitment by waiting in the 15-
minute voting line at Muir col-
lege on Tuesday, but the numbers 
that revealed their dedication did 
not even seem to include half of 
the school. While some had the 
excuse that they were not regis-

tered in the San Diego precinct, 
others did not even know that 
voting booths were on campus. 
The lack of political support 
among people between the ages 
of 18 to 23 has given political 
leaders the idea that young peo-
ple do not care and, even worse, 
will not vote. For this reason, 
these leaders do not listen and 
mostly disregard the ideas and 
problems of young people in that 

. age group. 
This past election was the first 

of the millenhium, not to mention 
the first election that many UCS D 
students had the opportunity to 
participate in . Unfortunately, it 
turned out to be a bore on ca m-
pus. Standing in line for 15 min-
utes, I noticed that people talked 
about anything but whom they 
were going to vo te for or what they 
wanted out of their future leaders. 
One student even claimed that he 
thought it would be funny to just 
close his eyes and randomly 
punch holes into the voting ba llot. 

What this campus needs, 
along with many other college 
campuses. is political awareness

tem is too fast and stressful to be 
considered sane. Exciting sporting 
events can break up the seemingly 
endless monotony of schoolwork 
making ever more convoluted tun-
nels in your brain. 

The one group ready to take on 
the call for more school spirit is the 
UCS D Pep Band. The fantastic, 
energized Pep Band is ready to play 
at most large sports events. They 
travel up to Davis every year for the 
annual Davis Picnic Day to square 
off against other pep bands from 
UC Berkeley, Stanford, Humboldt 
and UC Davis as well. As an incon-
sistent member myself. I can vouch 
that inside each Pep Band member 
is about a hundred times the normal 
amount of school spirit in~ide the 
average UCSD student. If anyone is 
willing to step up to the challenge of 
supporting a more exciting athletic 
program, it's the UCSD Pep Band. 

For those of you who have 
doubts about whether UCSD can 
maintain a high academic standard 
while increasing its emphasis on 
sports, have no fear. First of all, we 
just moved up to Division II and 
still do not offer scholarships to 
athletes (it was part of the deal) . 

Secondly, there is a plethora of 
examples of great, if not stellar, 
universities that continue to main-
tain outstanding .athletic as well as 
educational programs at their 
respective universities, some in our 
own UC system. UCLA and UC 
Berkeley compete for sports cham-
pionships yearly while still being 
academically ranked above UCSD 
on a national level. Lesser-known 
UC Davis wins the Sears Cup - a 
title won by one of the most domi-
nant school in sports for each

that our Thiton school spirit will

the case with this past weekend's

a school's focus on collegiate 
sports affects that standard 
adversely. 

Students influence a universi-
ty's academic standard even 
before they arrive on campus. 
The caliber of the students that a 
university .attracts and admits 
indicates that university'S educa-
tional quality. Top universities 
with strong athletic programs 
often try to attract potential ath-
letes by lowering admission stan-
dards and granting athletic 
scholarships. These preferential 
admissions lower the overall 
quality of admitted students and 
are unfair to other qualified stu-
dents who are also competing for 
admission. 

Athletic scholarships have the 
same effect. One's athletic, not 
academic, abilities determine 
one's access to these scholarships. 
Academic achievements become 
minor factors, and universities 
often overlook them as they try to 
attract able athletes. 

These admission and scholar-
ship issues occur most often at 
universities with famous athletic 
programs, because they are trying 
to maintain their athletic reputa-
tions. The pressure comes from 
students and others who focus 
more on sports than academics. 
Universities like UCSD can pre-
vent their academic standards 
from sliding further by making 
academics their top priority and 
giving athletic scholarships only 
to athletes with strong academic

Athletes continue to influence 
a university'S academic standard 
once they arrive on campus. 
Often, when student-athletes 
enter college, they become more 
athletes than they are students. 
There is strong pressure to do so 
partly because college sports com-

. pete at a higher level than high 
school sports, and partly because 
schools that are known for their 
athletic programs care more about 
their athletes' performance than 
their academics. 

The long hours athletes in 
universities across the nation

Some people might disagree and 
refer to the NCAA regulations on

formal sports practices, but it 
doesn't regulate informal, or

attend these optional practices. 
Whether all athletes do train 
excessively is unknown, but one 
can be sure that there is pressure 
to train hard , and that the 
stronger a university'S athletic 
department is, th~ stronger the 
pressure. All this training eventu-
ally turns an extracurricular 
activity into the student's prima.-
ry activity. Reduced study time 
translates into lower grades, 
which lower the university'S 
overall academic standards. 

Universities that emphasize 
athletics are also disadvantageous 
to their students. Their athl;:tic 
programs are more likely to pres-
sure their athletes to dedicate 
themselves to the team and the 
bare minimum to themselves. 
Often there is no happy medium 
between the time for the team 
and time for one's studies, which 
eventually forces the student to 
choose between the two. If the 
student chooses sports and the 
team over himself and his stud-
ies, then he will make his deci-
sions for the team's benefit. Uni-
versities that focus too much on 
athletics and pressure their stu-
dents to do the same jeopardize 
their students' futures instead of 
furthering them. 

By staying academic instead of 
turning athletic, UCSD is in step 
with the definition of a university. 
It serves both the community and 
its students adequately by provid-
ing them with a precious opportu-
nity to obtain higher education in 
their fields and valuable job skills 
in order to meet today's job mar-
ket challenges. UCSD's academic 
reputation and standard will con-
tinue to rise as a result of its ded-
ication to education and research, 
instead of sports.

Whether political Splrlt is

If the majority of young people 

continue to disregard who leads 
their country, future leaders will 
simply oppose all of their requests

with Ayn Rand and she was really 
annoying. I find that most parents, 
not just mine, have the same view 
of "The Fountainhead." They think 
it's a flaming pile of tripe, and not 
the good tasting tripe. Some of 
them give it a little slack and say it's 
a nice story, but most of the points 
made are crap, which is basically 
what my mother said about the 
Bible when I said I was going to a 
church retreat. 

One last thing I should note is 
that there's truth in the saying 
"only lend the books . you never 
care to see again." To give you a 
brief example, I have Steve's copy 
of "Snowcrash: Dave has my copy 
of "Mostly Harmless," but I have 
his copy of "Swann's Way." yet he 
has my copy of "Cat's Cradle," 
which has personal sentimental 
value for me because it was a 
Christmas present from Laura, 
whose copy of "Sech" [ have. 

I remember once in high school 
I traded my father's copy of"1984" 
for some guy named 'TYler's copy of 
some book that began with "Per-
ceptions by Huxley" but I let Jere-
my borrow it, and it's been missing 
in action ever since. The fact that [ 
let someone borrow a borrowed 
book is a perfect example of what 
to do with your books: Leave them 
on your shelf, and if someone asks 
about one of them, comment on 
the prevalence of Borders Books in 
the United States.

Bush's Lead in Florida Appears to Shrink 
as Two Counties Recount 

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - As 
lawyers prepared to square off in 
federal court over Gov. George W. 
Bush's efforts to block hand 
recounts of Florida's disputed 
vote tallies, election officials in at 
least two counties conducted 
manual recounts that appeared to 
further shrink Bush's slender lead 
over Vice President AI Gore. 

In the wee hours on Sunday 
morning, a divided election board 
in heavily Democratic Palm Beach 
County announced that a 
marathon recount of four sample 
precincts there .had produced 
enough discrepancies to warrant. 
an extraordinary manual recount 
of all 425,000 votes cast in the 
county. The county is at the cen-
ter of the wrangling because of 
disputes over the ballot format 
and several thousand punch-card 
ballots that may not hav~ been 
perforated clearly enough to be 
machine counted. 

Volusia County, in the east-
central part of the s¥,te. on Sunday 
became the first county to begin a 
full manual recount, and it had no 
sooner started than county lawyers 
prepared to sue the state on Mon-
day, seeking to extend the deadline 
to complete their count beyond 5 
p.m. Tuesday. 

Gore won that county by a 
comfortable margin of nearly 
15,000 votes. But under Florida 
law, if the votes from Volusia are

night that they would 
argue in federal court on 
Monday morning that 
the hand counts should 
proceed because they 
were allowed under 
Florida law and would 
be more accurate. 

not certified and submitted to 
the state's secretary of state, 
Katherine Harris, a Republican, 
by the Tuesday cutoff, state elec-
tion officials could invalidate all 
184,019 votes. 

Democratic aides, speaking 
on condition of anonymity, said 
on Sunday evening that they 
feared Harris would refuse to' 
certify any vote tallies reached by 
manual recount, and would 
accept only the mechanical 
recount automatically triggered 
by law last week because the 
election was so close. That would 
presumably give Bush a slightly 
larger, though still small, lead . 

An official in Harris' office 
would say only that she wpuld 
make a statement about certifica-
tion on Monday, a day before the 
certified results ' are due in her 

office here. 
With the unresolved election 

dragging into its sixth day, the 
cumulative recounts have now 
narrowed Bush's lead to' 288 
votes out of some 6 million cast 
statewide, with overseas absentee 
ballots due at the end of this 
week yet to be counted, accord-
ing to the unofficial running tally 
compiled by The Associated 
Press. Both sides agree that Flori-
da's 25 electoral votes will deter-
mine the outcome of the presi-
dential election, but they agreed 
Sunday on little else. 

Gore aides said on Sunday 
night that they would argue in 
federal court on Monday morning 
that the hand counts should pro-
ceed because they were allowed 
under Florida law and would be 
more accurate. They also said that 
any disputes about the state law 
governing them should be heard 
in state court rather than federal 
court. 

Republicans vowed to press 
their claim that selective counts 
would be a violation of the consti-
tutional guarantee to equal pro-
tection of the law, and refused to 
rule out seeking recounts in 
Republican-dominated Florida 
counties and in other states where 
Gore's advantage is slim.

A Battered yugoslavia Waits for 
West to Deliver on Promises of Aid 

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -
The new Yugoslavia has been wel-
comed back to the world almost 
uncritically by a United States and 
a Europe that cannot quite believe 
their luck. Siobodan Milosevic, 
the autocrat who stirred such tur-

. moil in the Balkans for so long, is 
gone. 

But the new Yugoslav and Ser-
bian governments are finding that 
Milosevic's rule left enormous 
holes in their budgets for basic 
needs like electricity, food and 
pensions, and a West that never 
believed Milosevic would fall so 
quickly has been caught unpre-
pared, promising quick aid but 
scrambling to deliver it 

Since Milosevic was overthrown 
in early October, the people of Ser-
bia have suffered prolonged electric 
shortages and power cuts and price 
rises on basic foods that brought 
inflation in October alone to 27 
percent, after the artificially restrict- . 
ed increases of 2 to 3 percent a 
month under Milosevic. 

The weather has been mild but 
will soon turn cold, putting sharp

and pension support to

new strains on energy supplies 
before the election; the pension 
system is broke, and there are sig-
nificant shortages of cooking oil, 
sugar and medicine. 

Serbian officials say they need 
$500 million in energy, food, med-
icine and pension support to get 
through the winter - $2 million a 
day alone for electricity and natur-
al gas. Western help is coming, but 
slowly, tied up with bureaucratic 
and political restrictions. 

"Serbia needs assistance right 
now and a timely supply of the 
fuel and electricity will consoli-

date democratic processes in the 
country: said the Serbian deputy 
prime minister, Nebojsa Covic. 

Miroljub Labus, the federal 
deputy prime minister, said the 
country it needs help from the 
West that promised it. 

"Frankly speaking, we have 
enough in promises, and we're 
grateful: he said." But disburse-
ment is another problem - it's a 
question of timing. We're in the 
middle of an energy crisis, and 
below that, we have a deep social 
crisis, with low wages and people 
very nervous about their future." 

The European Union has been 
pushing its varied countries and 
officials to get electricity and oil to 
Yugoslavia as fast as they can. 

"We've been bending every 
rule to get help here even a day 
sooner, especially energy, food 
and medicine," said Michael Gra-
ham, the European Union ambas-
sador here. "But with the best will 
in the world, it's complicated." .

Indonesian Supreme Court sen-
tenced him to 18 months in prison 
in a corruption case. 

In the eyes of many Indone-
sians, the case has come to resem-
ble a royal comedy of errors, raising 
questions about the government's 
commitment to establishing a new 
rule of law in Indonesia following 
decades of corruption under 
Suharto's dictatorial rule. Despite 
being convicted six weeks ago, 
Hutomo has remained free 
through a series of legal maneu-
vers, and mistakes by the prosecu-
tion, that constitutional scholars 
have described as absurd. 

Although Wahid announced 
last week that he had officially 
rejected Hutomo's request for 
clemency, lawyers for the convict-
ed businessman said their client 
would not surrender until prose-
cutors had formally served him 
with a copy of the presid~nt'~ rul-
ing. 

When prosecutors took a pho-
tocopy of the clemency rejection 
notice to Hetomo's home, his 
lawyers said it , was not valid,

two or three breaths. 

Christopher, a former. secretary 
of state, replied that he w s "a little 
out of practice" in working 
through such thorny is ues, then 
waded in : 

"First, we have the question 
about the hand recountS in those 
four counties and what they 
show, and then we have the over-
seas ballots that have to be count-

are going on right now. We also 
have our hands very full in trying 
to defend this unexpected chal-
lenge to the recounts that'S going 
to be brought in court tomorrow. 
When those things happen, at the 
end of that time, we'll begin look-
ing at other options. Now we're 
collecting facts, we're reviewing 
those options. I'm in no position 
now to give up that option, but 
it's something that we've stud-
ied." 

No one on the Sunday morn-
ing news programs is yet lapsing 
into Marx Brothers-style routines 
about the party of the first part. 
Still, the television debate about 
selecting the next president has 
moved into a foggy new linguistic 

because it had not been notarized. 
When the prosecution finally got 
its paperwork in order and a con-
voy of police descended on Huto-
mo's residence to arrest him, he 
was nowhere to be found . 

In the last week, police officials 
said that they had conducted a 
wide hunt for Hutomo in Jakarta 
and across Indonesia, including 
some of the country's most popu-
lar resort islands - Bali, Batam and 
Lombok - but that they had come 
up empty-handed. Now they have 
asked Interpol to place Hutomo's 
name on its worldwide list of most-
wanted people. 

The case is being viewed both 
here and abroad as a crucial test of 
the government's ability to tackle 
graft at a time when foreign 
investors have being steering clear 
of Indonesia because of wide-
spread corruption and growing 
unrest. 

A human-rights activist, Frans 
Hendra Winata, said in a recent 
television discussion that he 
doubted that authorities did not 
know Hutomo's whereabouts. 
"Tommy must be arrested as soon 
as possible to ensure the suprema-
cy of the law of Indonesia,~ he 
said.

arena. and as the exchange 
between F-4ssen and Christopher 
illustrated, exa~t'y where the 
process is heading may be as PQ:-
plexing to the experts as it is to 
people on the other side of the 
television screen. 

Even before their scheduled 
confrontation Monday in federal 
court, both parties were aggres-
sively pressing their cases on the 
airwaves about wlJether it was 
desirable to have hand recounts in 
four Florida counties in which 
Gore did well against Gov. George 
W. Bush . 

James A. Baker Ill, another for-
mer Secretary of State, speaking for 
the Bush camp by satellite from 
Tallahassee, Fla., condemned the 
recounting by hand as a prelude to 
serious inaccuracy and manipula-
tion. 

"It opens up tremendous pos-
sibilities for something worse 
than human error, and for mis-
chief: he said on "Meet the 
Press." 

The Democrats stressed the 
proceedings' credibility, all the 
while avoiding every opportunity 
to put a firm date on when the pro-
ceedings might end. 

"As long as ballots are being 
counted, obviously this process is 
going to go on: Joe Andrew, 
national chairman of the Democ-
ra:ic National Committee, said on 
MSNBC. "It really is somewhat 
absurd to put a date on it."

Jesse Jackson Visits Florida in Effort to Press for Civil Rights 
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -

As the Rev. Jesse Jackson continued 
a civil rights tour across South 
Florida on Sunday, rallying Jewish, 
black and Hispanic voters to 
demand an accurate count of the 
vote in Palm Beach County, Demo-
cratic officials and Goee advisers 
appeared to back away from earlier 
complaints that he was playing too 
large a role in demonstrations in 
the cou nty. 

"The Rev. Jackson has decades 
of experience leading the fight for 
voting rights: Jenny Backus, a 

spokeswoman for the Democratic 
National Committee, said in Talla-
hassee. "Like all Americans, we 
support his efforts to expand and 
protect a citizen's right to vote." 

Jackson said that no one from the 
Democratic National Committee 
had asked him to tamp down his 
efforts. He said that the breakdown 
.l?~ the electoral system was a civil 
rights issue as well as a political issue. 

Jackson, president of the Rain-
bow/Push Coalition Inc., said he 
flew to Chicago on Friday to take 
care of coalition business and· 

returned to Florida on Saturday. He 
attended an event Sunday morning 
at a nearly packed Temple Israel in 
Miami. Later he met with a group of 
elderly residents in Boca Raton. On 
Monday he planned to hold a prayer 
vigil in West Palm Beach. 

Democratic officials apparently 
have had an about-face on Jack-
son's involvement since last week, 
when it was said that he left South 
Florida after complaints that he 
was playing too large a role in the 
protests for a recount ballot. The 
sudden cancellation of an event at 

a temple in Boca Raton, and his 
return to Chicago, seemed/to lend 
some credence to the claim. 

Jackson said the election was 
fraught with problems for voters 
who were students, Haitian-Ameri-
cans, Hispanics, or new citizens who 
were migrant workers. He said that 
Jewish leaders had been supportive. 

"Today there is not a constitu-
tional crisis: Jackson said at the 
temple. "There is a counting crisis. 
We can afford to lose a race. We've 
lost many before. We cannot afford 
to lose a franchiSE:." 

He was joined at the temple by 
Kweisi Mfume, president of the 
National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People, 
and Rabbi Steven Jacobs, of Kol 
Tikavah Temple in Los Angeles. 
The forum was organized by the 
Black Jewish Civil Rights Coalition, 
which Jackson said wanted to 
ensure that the election outcome 
was just and reflected "the will of 
the people."

Former Chancellor York Receives 
Prestigious Enrico Fermi Award 
By JOSH CROUSE 
Senior Staff Writer 

Herbert F. York, a nuclear 
physicist and the founding chan-
cellor of UCSD, was named a 
recipient of this year's Enrico 
Fermi Award by President Clinton 
for his extensive work in nuclear 
deterrence and arms control 
agreements. 

The Enrico Fermi Award annu-
ally recognizes .individuals who 
have made great efforts and contri-
butions in the field of nuclear 
deterrence and arms control agree-
ments. Established in 1956, it is the 
government's oldest science and 
technology award. It is named for 
Enrico Fermi, who led the group of 
scientists at the University of 
Chicago that achieved the first self-
sustained, controlled nuclear reac-
tion in 1942. 

York is one of three scientists 
who will receive the award on Dec. 
18. He will be joined by Sidney 
Drell, a physicist at the Stanford 
Linear Accelerator Center, and 
Sheldon Datz, a physicist at the 
Oak Ridge National Laboratory. 

uThese scientists have made 
important scientific contributions 
in the fields of chemistry and 
physics: Clinton said in a press 
release. "Their pioneering work iri 
the very complex area of arms 
'control has benefited our nation 
and the world." 

The award will be presented by 
Secretary of Energy Bill Richard-
son in Washington. In addition to 
receiving a gofd medal, each sci-
entist WIll also get a $66,000 hon-
orarium. 

• [York} is the perfect choice for 
this award: stated UCSD Chan-

cellor Robert C. Dynes. "He has 
devoted most of his life to assur-
ing the responsible stewardship of 
nuclear weapons in the United 
States and has been the voice of 
reason for the la t half cen tury in 
the management of th is countly's 
nuclear weapons arsenal." 

York founded the UC Institute 
on Global Conflict and Coopera-
tion in 1983. He is currently th e 
emeritus director of the institute. 

"[York} recognized that build-
ing peace was more than control-
ling arms: stated Peter F. Cow hey, 
the director of the Institute on 
Global Conflict and Cooperation 
and a professor of international 
relations at lJCSD. "!-lis capstone 
experience at the University of 
California was his pioneering 
leadership of the university'S Insti-
tute on Global Conflict and Coop-
eration . The Institute's work 
brings together work on arms 
control, conflict resolution, eco-
nomic cooperation and environ-
mental stewardship in an effort to 
build an intellectual foundation 
for the 'long peace' that [York} 
wished for the world ." 

Among Yor~ 's other achieve-
ments are that he was the first 
director of the University of Cali-
fornia's Lawrence Livermore 
National Laboratory, a science 
advisor to President Eisenhower 
and a co-founder and first chief 
scientist of the Advanced 

Res~rch Projects Agency. 
York was also the ambassador 

and chief negoti~tor for the Com-
prehensive Test Ban Negotiations 
under President Carter and has 
headed efforts to reduce iriterna-
tional tensions through deter-
rence and negotiated arms control 

agn:cmrnts. 
In the official citation for the 

award, the White HOllse acknowl-
edged York "for his participation 
in the formulation, conduct, pro-
motion and explication of <lrms 
control policy; for his participa-
tion in the Manh\lttall Project; 
and for his founding direction of 
the Lawrmcl.' Livermore '31ional 
Laboratory; and his leadership ill 
research and engineering at the 
Departmcn t of Defense. 

His publications have set fonh 
with clarity and simplicity an 
understanding of the issues 
involved in all these actions. He 
has dedicated decadcs of his life to 
the informed advocacy of sensible 
choices in nuclear weapon sys-
tems and to the reduction of the 
nuclear threat." 

In addition, the White House 
commended York for his influ-
ence that has extended "bevond 
the halls of government. His work 
as an educator and author intro-
duced several generations of 
Americans to the best thinking on 
the history, science and politics of 
nuclear weapons development 
and arms control. His writings are 
among his most enduring contri-
butions to society's understandi[l& 
of peace and security issues." 

York has penned six books to 
date. They include "Arms Control; 
The Advisors: Oppenheiml!r, 
Teller and the Superbomb;" "Race 
to Oblivion: A Participant'S View 
of the Arms Race;" "Making 
Weapons, Talking Peace: A Physi-
cist's Journey from Hiroshima to 
Geneva;" "A Shield in Space? 
Technology, Politics and the 
Strategic Defense Initiative;" anq 
"Arms and the Physicist."

~AI'URES 
Let's Talk AbOut 

FEATURES 11 

A ccording to recent sur-veys, the average college student thinks about sex, sexual behavior and sexual issues over 100 
times per day. I do not know exactly 
how this information was gathered, 
however I do know one thing: UCSD 
students have always been above 
average. 

While discussion of sex was deemed inappropri-
ate in older times, .it is now vital for education 

Back in the 1960s, people who arc 
now the age of our parents thought 
they had literally reinvented the 
whecl when they started the sexual 
revolution. Suddenly, sexual behav-
ior. previously described as illicit, sin-
ful and evidence of moral depravity, 
became a sign that the parti ipants 
were enlightened. 

Whereas before when most pre-
marital sex had gone on between 
people who at least intended to marry 
each othcr (engagement sex), now 
people were going to bed with who-
ever they ended up with at the end of 
the night. This led, unfortunately, to 

-

-

. ~ ~ let of unsafe sexual practices in the 
name of "free love," which has conse-
quently left our generation holding 
the proverbial bag. Because we have 
the, knowledge and information to 
effectively prevent disease transmis-
sion and pregnancy, it is important. 
now more than ever, that people take 
precautions. 

By the time we reach college, most 
students at some point or another 
have heard an unhealthy mix of both 
factual and ' incorrect information 
regarding birth control. The truth of 
the matter is that the only sure way to 
avoid pregnancy and sexually trans-
mitted disease is to abstain from sex, 

Studies show, however, that this is 
not the preferable option for most 
coOege students. In fact, according to 
the Center for Disease Control. 86.1 
percent of college students nation-
wide have had sexual intercourse 
during their lifetime. In fact. more 
than one-third of college students 
nationwide have had sexual inter-
course with six or more partners. 

What this shows is that people are 
having sex. But even if you have 
already had sexual relations with 
someone, it is never too late to begin 
being safe. 
BIrth Control .ad lTD Prevention 

It is important to note that 
according to the CDC, 35.1 percent 
of college students nationwide 
reported that they had been pregnant 
or gotten someone pregnant. Assum-
ing that not all of them meant to get 
pregnant, this means that there are 
educated, young adults that are still 
making unsafe or unwise decisions 
regarding birth control. ' 

If you have decided that complete 
abstention from sexual behavior is 
not the most desirable option, rest 
assured, There are other ways to pro-
tect yourself. The best protection 
from sexually transmitted disease and 
accidental pregnancy begins with 
accurate and complete information. 

The decision to be unsafe can be 
unintentional. howevl'r, As we all 
know, it only takes one encounter to 
transmit disease or cause a pregnan-
cy. According to the CDC. college

The Editor's Soapbox 
Although the election raised some issues that need to be answered, the voice of the people was heard 
By BILL BURGER 
Managing Editor 

Tuesday evening started out as 
every other Tuesday does. I went to 
my three classes and then stopped 
by the Gllardian to see how every-
thing was looking. Everything after 
that point, however, was far from 
ordinary. I am sure by this point 
everybody has been informed 
about what transpired on Tuesday 
night and Wednesday morning. 
What isn't as well known is the 
ramifications of the events. 

When looked at in retrospect, 
Nov. 7 raised two very poignant 
questions that will have' to be 
answered before the next presiden-
tial election. 

First of all, there is the question 
of the media 's erroneous reporting. 
I have had a few quarters of statis-
tics and econometrics, so I under-
stand how the media use samples 
to predict the winner in specific 
states. If the sample is large 
enough, it is possible to run studies 
where you can be all but sure about 
the overall results. This is not what 
I have a problem with. 

The problem I have is how they 
factor in previous results into their 
prognostication. In a nutshell, what 
they are doing is using previous 
results and comparing them to the 
results that they get from their exit 
polls, and making a prediction 
based on those numbers. Theoreti-
cally, this would be a good practice, 

but the problem is that populations 
in certain areas change drastically 
between elections. 

Take Florida, the primary con-
tentious state for this election, for 
example. Florida's population is 
growing at one of the fastest rates 
of any state in the union. Also, the 
makeup of the different counties in 
Florida has been altered greatly of 
late. This caused the media a great 
many problems because they 
assumed that they were polling a 
representative sample of last elec-
tion 's voting population in each 
county of Florida. This turned out 
to be far from true, and the inaccu-
racy of their polls caused them to 
call Florida for Vice President AI 
Gore way before they should have. 

This problem only caused con-
fusion among the American popu-
lation and may have changed the 
voting patterns of people in states 
other than Florida. I figured the 
race was over when Florida was 
given to Gore, and if I hadn't 
already voted I may have decided to 
stay home rather then waste my 
time on a hopeless cause. If there 
were enough people like me in the. 
Western states, this mistake by the 
media may have altered the results 
of the election. 

Even though this mistake seems 
extraordinarily unprofessional and 

damagin~ to the electoral process, 
the medIa made another mistake 
Tue.sday night that may have been 
even more damaging. 

How can the will of the 
pepple be thwarted in this 
way? How can the 
majority of the people 
vote for one candidate 
while another one is 
chosen? The answer to 
these questions is simple: 
This is our system. 

The media is not allowed to 
announce their predictions for a 
particular state before all the polls 
in that state are closed. Florida was 
announced for Gore after most of 
the state's polls were closed, how-
ever there was a section that was 
still accepting votes. The panhan-
dle of Florida is in the Central time 
zone, and its polls closed an hour 

afler the majority of Florida's polls. 
As a result, prospective voters in 
Florida's panhandle region saw that 
Florida had gone to Gore, and con-
sequently, many of the voters that 
were going to vote for Bush may 
have stayed home rather than vot-
ing. 

Therefore, as a result of the 
media's wrongful announcements, 
the legitimacy of Florida's vote 
count may have been jeopardized. 
CNN and NBC had better hope 
Bush wins, or they may have seri-
ous lawsuits on their hands. 

The other problem that was 
revealed by the events of election 
2000 revolves around the possible 
discrepancy between the popular 
vote and the electoral vote counts. 
Although it isn't a sure thing yet, it 
appears as though Bush is going to 
win the electoral vote and the elec-
tion, while losing the popular vote 
to Gore. Although reports that this 
will cause upheaval throughout the 
nation and lock the president-elect 
in endless red tape are erroneous, 
this discrepancy does beg the ques-
tion of whether the electoral college 
is consistent with democratic ideals. 

How can the will of the people 
be thwarted in this way? How can 
the majority of the people vote for 
one candidate while another one is 
chosen? The answer to these ques-
tions is simple: This is our system. 

It was originally set up because 
a national election was not fusible 
in the 18th and early t~h a;n-

turies, so people voted for a dele-
gate and that delegate voted for the 
president. Many people argue that 
with the Internet and altogether 
improved communications net-
works, a popular vote would be 
optimum. The 2000 election has 
affirmed that belief for many peo-
ple. 

The problem is that the elec-
toral college I}ow functions to pro-
tect the rights of smaller states. 
Alaska and South Dakota would 
never receive any concessions in a 
pcpular vote because of their rela-
tively small populations. But 
because they each have three elec-
toral votes, which are . actually 
much more than representative of 
their population relative to the rest 
of the country, they are visited by 
the candidates and given promises 
if they elect that candidate. 

When this is considered, a 
switch to a pure popular vote may 
not be the best path for the entire 
country. What should be done? 
Got me! All I know is that we are 
now aware of the prOblem and can ' 
no longer consider these problems 
hypothetical and ignore them. This 
election has made them all too real 
and put them in the forefront of 
our minds. 

Something must be done about 
the media and the issue of the elec-
toral college must be addressed 
before the next election so these 
problems don't manifest them-
selves again.

Sex: 
Tests for STDs are scary, 
but necessary 
CantlMed from pep 11 
students are not being safe. 
Although 79.8 percent of college 
students reported using some 
form of birth control during their 
last sexual intercourse, these 
methods included everything 
from birth control pills and con-
doms to the withdrawal method 
(coitus interruptus), which is not 
a safe form of birth control. 

"Only 29.6 percent of students 
who had sexual intercourse dur-
ing the 3 months preceding the 
survey had used a condom at last 
sexual intercourse, and 34.5 per-
cent had used birth control pills,· 

, reports the CDC. 
, Before deciding to become 

sexually active, it is best if you and 
your partner step back and take a 
few precautions before jumping 
into the sack. Both opposite sex 
and same sex partners need to be 
aware of sexually transmitted dis-
eases. 

First, all participants who have 
engaged in sex previously should 
be tested for any sexually trans-
mitted diseases. Women who 
have had their annual exam 
should not assume that a healthy 
pap smear means that they are 
disease-free. STDs such as HlV 
and AIDS, hepatitis, gonorrhea 
and others are not always auto-
matically tested for. Doctors often 
require that patients not only ver-
bally request the test, but that 
they sign consent forms. These 
tests can require blood samples, 
urine samples or swabs from the 
genitals. Not all STDs have visi-
ble symptoms, so it is highly 

I advisable that anyone engaging in 
sexual activity with a previously 
sexually active partner request

these tests. 
After all the tests have been 

taken, the second step for hetero-
sexual partners is appropriate 
birth control. There are several 
ways to stop pregnancy, and all 
have positive and negative side 
effects. The best plan is to pick a 
form of birth control that is 
acceptable to you and your part-
ner. 

Some people prefer chemical 
methods like birth control pills or 
a Depo-provera shot that is effec-
tive for three months. The pill is 
an option, provided the woman 
does not react nes.atively to the 
hormones in the pIli, and takes it 
consistently. A second form of 
birth control should be used in 
the event that a woman on the pill 
fails to take her required dosage 
more than one time during the 
month . 

"Millions of women use the 
pill because it is convenient, reli-
able and safe. It is more than 99 
percent effective - depending on 
how correctly it is used. It is safer 
than pregnancy and childbirth for 
nonsmoking women of all ages," 
states the Planned Parenthood 
Web site. 

Women who smoke should 
not take birth control pills. 
According to Planned Parent-
hood, women over age 35 who 
smoke and take the pill are nearly 
40 times more likely to have a 
heart attack than women who do 
not smoke or take the pill . 

For women who do smoke, or 
who have difficulty remembering 
to take birth control pills every 
day at the same time, there is 
another chemical alternative. 
Depo-provera, or DPMA, is the 
brand name 0(- a prescription 
method of reversible birth con-
trol. It is a hormone like proges-

Sex: 
Fonns of birth control 
available vary widery 
ContInued from ...,. 14 
terone, one of the hormones that 
regulates the menstrual cycle. 

"A shot of DMPA in the buttock 
or arm can prevent pregnancy for 
12 weeks. The shot keeps the 
ovaries from releasing eggs, thick-
ens cervical mucus to keep sperm 
from joining eggs, and is 99.7 per-
cent effective against pregnancy,· 
states the Panned Parenthood Web 
site. 

The shot is one of the most 
effective reversible methods of 
birth control. Of every 1,000 
women who use it, only three will 
become pI egnant during the first 
year. Protection is immediate if you 
get the shot during the first five 
days of your period. Otherwise, use 
an additional method of contracep-
tion for the first two weeks. Protec-
tion will last for approximately 12 
weeks. It is a safe form of birth con-
trol, but it does not prevent trans-
mission of STDs. The Depo-
provera shot and a variety of differ-
ent birth control pills are available 
at the student health center. 

Condoms or diaphragms are 
also acceptable alternatives. 
Diaphragms are a safe form of birth 
control, however they must be 
inserted two hours before sex, and 
!TIust stay in place at least eight 
hours after sex. The advantage of 
condoms i~ that they are an' excel-
lent way to prevent the transmis-
sion of ~TDs. Other forms of birth 
control do prevent pregnancy 
when used correctly, however they 
do not prevent disease transmis-
sion. [n all cases, spermicide should 
be used in addition to condoms 
and diaphragms. 

Some people complain that 
each of these options takes away 
the spontaneity of sex. However, 
planning for sex can make the 
actual act much better. Anticipated, 
coordinated and deliberate sexual 
activity forces both participants to 
take full responsibility for their 
behavior, bu~ Can also ultimately 
increase the enjoyment. 
E....,..ncy Contrac.ptlve 

In the ('vent that your primary 
form of birth control does fail, ' 
there are alternatives. The Student 
Health center and Planned Parent-
hood provide an emergency con-
traceptive. Emergency contracep-
tion, or EC, is birth control YOll 
take after you have sex, but before 
pregnancy. It should be used for 
emergencies only, because it is less 
effective than regular methods of 
contraception . 

EC is used in the event that you 
have engaged in unprotected sex, if 
your primary form of birth control 
failed (like a ripped condQ/ll), or in 
the event of sexual assault. 

"Emergency contraceptives are 
regular birth control pills adminis-
tered in higher doses over a short 
period of time. EC works in several 
different ways. It thickens the 
mucus at the opening of the womb 
(the cervix), making it harder for 
sperm to get through . If it's taken at 
certain ' times in the menstrual 
cycle, it may prevent ovulation . Or, 
it may make the lining of the uterus 
thinner, so an egg does not become 
implanted," states the Planned Par-
enthood Web site. 

Be aware that emergency con-
traception is not the most pleasant 
experience. Most women who take 
it experience some nausea. Accord-
ing to Planned Parenthood, it is not 
as effect ive as birth control pills or 
barrier methods. However, nearly 
75 percent of pregnancies may be 
prevented by EC. It is most efTective 
if taken within 72 hours of unpro-
tected sex. I t does not work if 
someone is already pregnant. 
.. Safe About ...... We 

Accurate information is not 
always easy to come by in this soci-
ety where discussion of sexuality is 
often taboo. 

Even people with the best of 
intentions may not be completely 

informed on the subject of sex, 
because there is so much false 
information . Be sure that you 
check multiple sources, or at least 
verify your information when seek-
ing out the best possible forms of 
birth control and STD prevention. 

Here are a few tips: Be wary of 
anyone telling you that more is bet-
ter. Some may think that if one 
condom is safe, then two is even 
better. Rubber rubbing against rub-
ber equals a ripped condom. Under 
no circumstances should couples 
"double up," and that includes 
using a female and male condom 
together. To be safer, consider 
using two forms of birth conrrol , 
like the pill and condoms, a Depo-
provera shot and condoms, or 
something to that effect. A barrier 
method coupled with a chemical 
inhibitor greatly reduces the harm-
ful effects of human error. 

Some "how-to" guides may 
inadvertently contradict themselves 
or provide dangerous tips for sexu-
ally active couples. One book pre-
scribed using mineral oil as a lubri-
cant on one page, and cautioned 
people to use condoms on another. 
Be aware that any oil-based lubri-
cants compromise the integrity of a 
latex condom, and virtually ensure 
breakage or leakage. This includes 
mineral oils, hand lotions, massage 
lubricants and whipped cream. 
Avanti condoms are nonlatex con-
doms that will not break when 
partnered with oil-based lubri-
cants. However, they do not pro-
vide any protection against STDs. 
Additionally, introducing oil into 
the vagina Cdn result in uncomfort-
able infections. [t is best to stick 
with water-based lubricants, such 
as KY jelly or others when using 
lubricants during sexual inter-
course. 

One final warning: Birth control 
pills become less effective, to the 
point of being completely ineffec-
tive, when taken with any antibi-
otics. Some doctors fa il to realize 
that their female patients are on 
birth control pills when they pre-
scribe antibiotics, and this can 
result in unintended pregnancy. Be 
sure to let your doctor know that 
you are on birth control pills when 
he IS giving you a prescription. It is 
best, if you need to take antibiotics, 
to use an additional method of 
birth control while taking the med-
ication. 

In no way should this be con-
sidered a comprehensive treatment 
of birth control, or of safe sexual 
behavior. If you are considering 
becoming sexually active, or are 
interested in amending your previ-
ous forms of birth control, Student 
Health services on campus has a 
free clinic to help people choose 
the right birth control method for 
them. Additionally, information is 
available from Planned Parent-
hood, or from your health care 
provider.

birth control and safe sexual 
behavior, contact the student

enthood at (619) 683-7526, or go

Like a Phoenix, the Tritons' Hopes Arise From the Ashes 
After two devastating losses, Triton volleyball makes it to the playoffs by the skin of their teeth 
ByTAIT MIWR 
Associate News Editor 

UCSD Women 's volleyball trav-
elled up to Los Angeles to play Cal 
Poly Pomona and Cal State San 
Bernardino this weekend but came 
away from their stint up North 
with nothing but rwo losses. 

UCSD met the Broncos of 
Pomona on Friday njght at Darlene 
May gym in PomonY!. The Tritons, 
as the second place team in the 
California Collegiate Athletic Asso-
ciation, were heavily favored com-
ing into this match. 

The first set was not indicative 
of this, however, as UCSD had a 
negative hitting percentage at -.161 
and lost the game 15-4. 

UCSD bounced back io the sec-
ond set with a 15-11 win to even 
the set score at one each. 

The match really paralleled this 
up-and-down roller coaster ride all 
night long. One team would win a 
set and look like they were building 
momentum and then the opposing 
team would storm right back to 
take the next set. 

"We playa lot of games during 
the season and we've just been in a 
little bit of a slump lately:' said 

UCSD head coach Duncan McFar-
land. 

Cal Poly Pomona took the third 
set with a decisive 15-8 win, but true 
to form, UCSD came back and took 
a hard fought fourth set 15-13. 

UCSD took a S-4 lead early in 
the fifth set. Then the Broncos 
seemed to step up their intensity 
and reeled off four consecutive 
points to take a lead at 8-5 that 
they would not relinquish. 

The Tritons cut the Broncos' 
lead to 10-9 but that was as close as 
it would get and Cal Poly Pomona 
pulled it out with a 15-9 win. 

UCSD was led by Laura San-
terre who had 12 kills and six digs. 
The Tritons also received good per-
formances from jennie Wilson and 
jamie Woods who each had 11 kills. 

Karla Tate of the Broncos set a 
school record with 32 kills in the 
game. She added four digs. 

The Tritons moved on to CSU 
San Bernardino the next weekend 
and looked as if they were still hung 
over from the previous day's defeat. 

They came out and were 
promptly put behind a set by the 
score 15-6. 

The second set proved to be no 
different as they fell to an identical 

score. 
With their backs against the 

wall the Tritons rallied to take San 
Bernardino to extra points but 
that was all she wrote as UCSD 
was not' able to pull it out and lost 
16-14. 

Santerre again stood out for the 
Tritons with 10 kills and three digs. 

"Mth school and midterms 
and how many games we 
play, it is hard to keep 
going all season, But our 
earlier games really secured 
us this spot. " 

- DuIlAll McF ...... 
Women's Volleyball Head Coach 

Wilson had a dig to compliment 
her 11 kills and Woods led the 
team in digs with five. 

The Tritons were plagued by 
poor hitting the whole weekend as 
they posted a hitting percentage 
below .100 in four out of the eight 
sets they played. 

With the loss on Friday the Tri-

tons dropped into a three-way tie 
f6r second place and with the loss 
on Friday they slid even further 

in~o the pack, all alone in fourth 
place. CSU Bakersfield and CSU 
San Bernardino are in a two-way 
tie for second place. 

The West region gets six berths 
in the NCAA tournament and three, 
possibly four, teams from the CCAA 
will be selected for these berths. 

With UCSD's two losses the 
picture for the playoffs, which just 
Thursday was bright and crystal 
clear, is now clouded with doubt. 

However, due to Grand Canyon 
University'S poor performance this 
weekend, UCSD was granted the 
sixth spot in the West regional 
playoffs. 

Said McFarland, "We thought 
we were out of it but due to Grand 
Canyon's performance and our 
own strong showings earlier on in 
the year, we got the spot." 

UCSD certainly deserves the a 
berth as all season long the team 
has had a stranglehold on second 
place in the CCAA. 

"We are excited and the team 
really deserves this: McFarland 
said. "With school and midterms 
and how many games we play, it is

our earlier games really secured us 
this spot: 

The team will play Cal State Bak-
ersfield Thursday in the S p.m. 
game. at Cal State Los Angeles: 

"We are going to take it easy in

shoes and had a free run at the goal 
from 3S yards. A great play from 
the Cossack goalie, however, kept 
the score tied at 0-0. 

The Tritons just played Sonoma 
State on Nov. 5 and according to 
head coach Brian McManus, this 
could have affected the way the 
first half was played. 

"We were a little bit tentative in 
the first half and that has some-
thing to do with last week when 
they threw everything they had at 
us in the last ten minutes, head-on 
straight on: McManus said . 
"There was no good soccer being 
played and that threw us off a little 
bit. We started off the same we fin-
ished last week: sitting back: 

The second half brought with it 
a change of pace on the Tritons' 
part. 

McManus had started going to 
his bench at about the 30 minute 
mark in the first half, and when the 
second half started, the Tritons' 

ti:es~ legs overwhelmed the Cos-
sack defense. 

"This year we have used the 
bench more than other years, and 
as . the game went on." said 
McManus, "our bench was a little 
bit stronger than their bench." 

Throughout the final 40 min-
utes, UCSD players seemed more 
eager and more alive than their 
opponents, and this was finally 
reflected on the scoreboard when 
the Tritons scored at the 51 :05 
mark. 

Off a corner kick from Julia 
Cuder, sophomore midfielder 
Lauren jacobs took the ball on 
the bounce from teammate 
Megan Mendoza, and with what 
5eemed like a nonchalant nip of 
her foot put it past the Cossack 

goalie to give the Tritons a f-o 
read 

"It was kind of bouncing 
around in the box and it just came 
off of Megan 's thigh and for what-
ever reason I was there and just 
took it." said jacobs 

All season long the Tritons 
have been strong from the corner, 
and this goal seemed to be in the 
making from the very beginning of 
the second half, when the Tritons 
came out and appeared to be just 
half a step quicker than the Cos-
sacks. 

"We just had to keep pushing 
forward and working hard and we 
knew it was coming: jacobs said. 

From that point on, the Tritons 
defensc took over. For the rest of 
the game, SSU had only one look 
at a goal. 

Maggie Percell, a Cossack for-
ward, made a nice move down the 
left sideline and scnt a curving shot 
toward the goal that looked like it 
was headed for the back of the net. 
However, niton goalie Kami Poma, 
ranging far to her left, made a ter-
rific diving stop to maintain the 
Tritons' 1-0 lead. 

At this point, all the wind 
seemed to go out of the SSU sails. 
After outshooting the tritons 7-4 in 
the first half the UCSD outshot 
them 12-4 in the second half 
including three corner kicks to 
their one. 

In the 79th minute, UCSD for-
ward Christy Abiziad, on a beauti-
ful pass from Kristin jones, tacked 
another goal onto the team's tally 
to make the final score a resound-
ing 2-0 shutout. 

Defense was the name of the 
game for the .Tritons as in three 
matches agasint SSU they have 
shut them out three times, and in 
this matdl. the Cossaks, despite a 
few opportunities, never seemed to 
be able to get anything started. 

Cuder said, "We worked on our 
defense all week with Brian and 
when you have people like Jess who

plays center full and Kara Morris 
who plays on the outside who 
come with experience - they stop 
everything. It makes everyone else's 
job easier." 

Its defense, combined with 
scoring the first goal, really put 
UCSD over the top. 

"We got together before the 
second half and said, 'we can do 
this, we are the best team out 
here:" Cuder said. "If we get one 
goal, our defense shuts out, and 
as soon as we score it is such a 
lift. " 

The Tritons have been the best 
team in their conference all year 
long and this game proved it as 

UCSD came out and beat SSU for 
the third time this season, all three 
by shutouts. 

Sonoma's head coach agreed. 
"They stepped up their level in 

the second half: Oberkirch said. 
"They are just a good team and 
are tough to beat. The better team 
won today, they are the best team 
in our region, and they deserved 
to win ." 

This game gives the Tritons 
some momentum heading into the 
second round of the playoffs. 

"We have 10 first-year players 
and by now this should be giving 
them confidence." McManus said. 
"We have been in three overtime 

games and knock on wood, won 
each of them. The longer we are 
in games, the more chance we 
have to win, and we know that the 
longer we are in games the 
momentum continues to go our 
way." 

This win improves the Tritons 
record to 18-2 overall and they 
maintain their 12-2 league record. 

UCSD's next game will be on 
either Nov. 18 or Nov. 19 against 
Central Oklahoma. 

There is a 90 percent chance 
the game will be played here at 
home on Sunday at 1 o'clock. If it 
is, let's see some UCSD support for 
our stellar women's soccer team.

ports legends spending an 
entire career with one 
team are very special. It is 

also increasingly rare. 
This is why Tony Gwynn 

should either accept the San 
Diego Padres' most recent con-
tract offer, or he should retire 
from baseball. He should not go 
to another team. 

It used to be that sporting leg-
ends would spend their whole 
careers with one organization. A 
star would stay with a team until 
he broke down, then retire and be 
immortalized forever by that 
team. 

Now, in this time of free 
agency and today's crazy sports 
economics, players jump around 
more than a hyperactive child on 
a pogo stick. Most players chase 
the big bucks or hopes of a shiny 
championship ring. Loya lty by 
both the player and the organiza-
tion has been shot to hell. 

There are some cases today of 
players staying with their teams 
through thick and thin . Baseball 
Hall of Famers George Brett and 
Robin Yount stuck with the Roy-
als and Brewers, respectively, 
throughout their careers. They 
should be commended. On the 
hardwood, Magic, Michael and 
Larry all stayed with the same 
club. On the gridiron, Dan Mari-
no played for the Dolphins, and 
only the Dolphins, and John 
Elway did the same fo r the Bron-
cos. 

Before reti ring, Marino could 
have gone to Minnesota, but 
instead opted to play golf on Sun-
days. 

Players ra rely succeed in trying 
to jump start their careers in 
another city while their sun is set-
ting on their playing days. 

This is what Gwynn is trying to 
do. He still wants to play. You 
can't blame him, it's in his blood. 
Baseball is a part of his DNA, as is 
his competitiveness. But Tony, it is 
time to hang up the uniform. 

Can he still play? Well, in the 
field, tha t is an almost definite 
"no." His age and his knees won't 
let hi m go chasing after balls in 
the outfield like he did during his 
Gold Glove years. 

The question still exists of 
whether he can still hit. The 
answer is yes and no. When he is 
healthy, he most certain ly can. 
Last season, he beat the ball all 
around the diamond when he got 
a chance, but he sat out most of 
the season with injuries. 

The Padres are tryi ng the best 
they can with Tony. They offered 
the aging right-fielder a $1 mil-
lion contract with numerous 
incentives that can jack his pay up 
even more. 

Still, it is not er.ough for 
Gwynn. It is not the money - he 
wants an opportunity to play full -
time, which he won't receive from 
the Padres. So, he is entertaini ng 
offers from other clubs. 

What is happening between 
the Padres and Gwynn can almost

UCSD Conquers SSU 
Triton defense· dominates the second half for a 2-0 victory 
By TAIT MILLER 
Associate Sports Editor 

After playing the first 40 
minutes tit for tat, the UCS D 
women's soccer team dominated 
the second half to defeat visiting 
Sonoma State in the first round 
of the NCAA Division 1I playoffs 
2-0. 

The first half had some great 
action, but was marked by 
missed scoring opportunities 
and nervous play on both sides 
of the ball. 

"We played great in the first 
half," said Sonoma State head 
coach Luke Oberkirch. "We 
missed a couple of chances or 
half chances, but we still played 
our hearts out in the first half." 

Sonoma State had two great 
looks in the first 20 minutes but 
each time they gOt near the Tri-
ton goal. UCSD was able to 
repel their attack with some out-
standing defense. 

UCS D was not without 
openings in the fi rst half, as 
around the 30 min ute mark, 
midfie lder Kristen Conahan

Tritons Want to Put the Ball on the Floor 
Although young, the women's basketball team is looking to make a dent in Division II 
By ARVIND VASAN 
Staff Writer 

Get ready" for a great season of 
hoops action as the UCSD 
women's basketball team gears up 
fo r the 2000-2001 season. 

At the helm for the Tri ton 
sq uad is Judy Malone, who is 
starting her 25th year as the Tri-
tons' head coach. She compiled a 
record of 20 wins and 6 losses last 
year in Division lll , and her overall 
record is 341 -261 , a winning per-
centage of 56.6 percent. This will 
be her first year as a Division II 
head coach. 

"Our competition level wi ll 
increase a notch as we move up a 
divis ion," Malone said. "There was 
a large disparity of matches in 
Divis ion III; some teams were 
tough, while some teams were 
walk-overs. In Division II , each 
game will be a battle. There are no 
more easy games." 

As for the team itself, there are 
only three seniors on the squad, 
with five returnees from last year. 
The team has seven freshmen 
playing this year, with one junior 
transfer. With such a young team, 
the Tritons have some inexperi -
ence, but they still hope to make 
their mark in their first year at 
Division II . 

Playoff Update: 

"We were expecting 11 players 
back, but that was not the case," 
Malone said. "We du, however, 
have four of our five top scorers 
back. This should keep us in 
games, and allow the other players 
to develop as the season rolls 
along." 

Forward Ki mberly Neil led 
the Tritons last year with 11 .6 
poin ts per ga me and 6.4 

together. 
· We are truly optimistic about 

the upcoming year: Malone said. 
"We expect a lot out of players like 
juniors Maya Fok, who hurt her 
wrist during the off-season, and 
Danyiel Wortham, a workhorse in 
the post. It is also evident that the 
incoming freshmen will be put 
into leadership rolls with the lack 
of seniors on the team, and I think

rebounds per ga me. Center 
Renee Hudec held the team lead 
in total rebounds in the season . 
Forward Genevieve Ruvalt had 
the most assists and steals for 
the Tritons, which maintains this 
triumvirate in their strong start-
ing lineup. 

With this talent up front , the 
freshmen players must step up in 
their respective positions so that 
every element is on point. One of 
the most important parts of a team 
is how well its diffet:ent parts fit

they will respond to the chal-
lenge." 

The UCSD women's basketball 
team has made the playoffs six out 
of the last seven years in Division 
III. Last year, the team lost to 

Da~is, the second-place team in 
the conference, but defeated 
Chico State handily, who claimed 
third place. 

Pomona buried all competi-
tion, piling a record of 19-1 in 
conference play a.nd an overall 
record of 26-3. They were the 

only team to represent the confer-
ence in the NCAA champi-
onships. 

The fi rst game for the UCS D 
women's basketball team will be at 
Point Lorna Nazarene on Nov. 17. 
After that, it is on to Christian 
Heritage College and Vanguard 
University on Nov. 30 and Dec. 2, 
respectively. 

Then, after an arduous week of 
finals, the Tritons go to Chico 
State and UC Davis to face their 
ri vals. This will ta ke place on the 
Saturday and Sunday of fin als 
week, therefore rest and relaxation 
is going to be delayed for a couple 
of days. 

After that it is San Francisco 
State University on Dec. 15, the 
home opener for the Tritons. 
Rounding out the 2000 campaign, 
Sonoma State University comes to 
town on Dec. 16 and the UCSD 
Doubletree Invitational on Dec. 
29 to Dec. 30. The Tritons will 
host the event. . 

As it seems, the UCSD 
women's basketball team has a 
tough mountain to climb to reach 
the NCAA playoffs, but with the 
top scorers still remaining, as well 
as the young ta lented freshmen 
and sophomores on the squad, 
this looks like a promising 2000-
2001 season.
