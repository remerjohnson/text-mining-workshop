Administrators Downplay RIMAe Faults 
PAa.. SINKING: Soil voids have caused facility

as six inches. During an interview in 
early Oct. 1994, Hellmann said that "the 
soil [under RIMAC) sank two to six 
inches" and that, using a process called 
pressure grouting, concrete was injected 
into the affected areas to fill "the voids 
underneath the building." 

While initial reports lessened the Importance of RIMAe's 
emergency pressure-grouting repair program, new evidence 
shows that the grout was used to create support columns for 
the floor - not just to fill in voids under the facility. 

Problems afflicting UCSD's $32 
million RecreationaVI ntramural Athletic 
Complex (RIMAC) were more severe 
than university administrators initially 
indicated, according to new evidence 
showing shifting footings, stabilization 
problems and minor structural damage 
to the facility. 

However, documents obtained last 
week by the GUIlrdian show that the 
voids were larger than ' Hellmann indi-
cated, causing the weight room floor to 
tilt and creating hairline cracks through-
out the complex. 

Assistant Vice Chancellor of Facili-
ties Design and Construction (FD&C) 
Boone Hellmann originally said that 
soil beneath the 175,OOO-square-foot 
building had sunk, leaving voids as deep 

In a memo dated June 27, 1994, Al-

UCSD Cross-Cultural Center Opens Doors 
FESTIVITIES: 100 students, 
staff and faculty participate in 
ribbon-cutting ceremony 
By Doug Alexander 
Senior Staff Writer 

Marking the end of a lengthy battle to establish 
a cultural center at UCSD, the Cross-Cultural 
Center opened its doors Friday with a dedication 
and· ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by over 
100 students, faculty and staff members. 

The controversial 4,800-square-foot center, 
which was approved by the chancellor last year 
following a heated campus debate, is intended to 
foster communication between different ethnic 
groups as well as to provide support services for 
underrepresented students. 

"This is a very emotional moment for all of us," 
said Literature Professor George Mariscal, chair 
of the center's steering committee. 

"This center stands as an inclusive enterprise 
for all groups ... ," he added. "This center represents 
a vision of the university that doesn't exist yet." 

A.S. President Naomi Falk, who also spoke at 
the ceremony, said the facility will improve rela-
tions between different groups on campus. "The 

center will provide a much-needed link between 
the diverse constituency at UCSD," Falk said. "A 
link that will enrich, strengthen and empower all 
of us." 

The center, which is located on the Eleanor 
Roosevelt campus near the new Visual Arts Facil-
ity, is jointly funded by the chancellors' offices of 
student, business and academic affairs and has a 
operating budget of $125,000. 

According to Interim Director of the Cross-
Cu Itural Center Yvonne Reid-Hairston, the center 
will employ six student interns and two full-time 
staff members. She added that the administration 
is currently deciding whether to create a third staff 
position. 

"The future of the center depends on proper 
staffing," Mariscal said. "We need a strong com-
mitment from the administration .... I f we don't get 
that, I don't think it will succeed." 

Calling the establishment of the center "only a 
beginning," Student Affirmative Action Commit-
tee Chair Buu Aaron urged students at the dedica-
tion to become politically active on issues such as 
affirmative action, which is facing multiple legis-
lative challenges in California.

A.S. Votes to 
CutUCSA 
Contribution 
FUNDING: Naomi Falk 
vows to veto any reduction 
in current UCSA support 
By Terry Lew 
Staff Writer 
and Nina BoUChton 
Staff Writer 

In an effort to maintain University of 
California Student Association (UCSA) 
fundi ng at its current $1.50 per student level, 
A.S. President Naomi Falk said she will veto 
the 1995-96 A.S. activity fee budget at 
tomorrow's council meeting. 

Although the A.S. Council approved re-
ducing UCSA funding to $1 per student per 
year on Friday, Falk said she felt the vote 
was not decisive enough to let it stand with-
o~ further discussion. 

"The reason ... I'm choclsing to veto this 
budget is that the vote was so incredibly 
close," said Falk. "You don't want [the vote] 
to be a close majority either way, whether 
it's with my wishes and desires or not. .I 
don't think the issue has been resolved -
it's too close to call." 

The council voted 11 to nine in favor of 
funding cut, with four abstentions. Roosevelt 
Sophomore Senator Loren Kinczel's writ-
ten request to change his vote from yes to no, 
which would have deadlocked the tally at 
10-10-4, was rejected by A.S. secretary Anna 
Catalanotto because votes must be cast in 
person. 

Many senators who voted in favor of 
reducing UCSA funding to $1 maintained 
that the UCSA was a worthwhile organiza-
tion. "' believe strongly in what they do," 
said Muir Sophomore Senator Tony Fiori. "I 
just don't think they've been as effective 
since Smith II. Regents." 

Smith v. Regents is a 1993 Supreme Court 
decision which prohibits the use of manda-
tory student fees to fund organizations 
deemed political, religious or ideological in 
nature. According to UC guidelines, the 
ruling bars the UCSA and other student-

Roger Dashen, professor and

"As chair of physics, Roger

Goldberger. "He was, in addition,

Dashen also served as chair of a 
Navy committee on tbe security of 
missile-arrying submarines and 
other aspects of anti-submarine 
warfare. In addition, he belonged

Regents Move June Meeting to S.E 
BOARD: Affirmative 
action protests spur 
move from UCLA 
By Jon ... Palmer 
AsSOCiate News Editor 

Citing Jh~ need for a larger fa-
cility for its upcoming hearings on 
affirmative action, the UC Board 
of Regents decided Friday to move 
its June 15-16 ~eeting from its 
scheduled location at UCLA to the 
Laurel Heights facility in San Fran-
cisco. 

In an open letter to the regents, 
Regent Secretary Leigh Trivette 
wrote that the San Francisco loca-
tion would-be able to beller accom-
modate the number of people ex-
pected to attend the affirmalive 
action discussion. 

"In view of the substantial and 
growing interest in mailers ex-
pected to be discussed at the June 
meeting, Chairman [Howard] 
Leach and President [Jack J Peltason 
have agreed that it would better 
serve the interests of the university 
to have the meetings in a larger 

facility," stated Trivette. "The 
meeting room at Laurel Heights 
offers that accommodation. " 

However, Executive Director of 
the University of California Student 
Association Glenn Magpantay said 
the meeting was probably moved to 
avoid protests planned at UCLA. 
"I'm not surprised," he said. "But 
I'm dismayed that they made the 
decision to stay away from students. " 

Magpanta y added that such sen-
timents probably resulted from the 
disruption at the May 18 regents 
meeting in San Francisco, which 
led to the adjournment of the affir-
mative action hearing. 

Student Regent-designate Ed-
ward Gomez, who was arrested for 
refusing to leave the May 18 hear-
ing after it was adjourned, said the 
meeting was moved to accommo-
date a larger audience and to avoid 
a large affirmative action protest 
planned for UCLA. 

"I would assume that they have 
a little better control [at Laurel 
HeightsJ," he said. 

According to Gomez, however, 
the affirmative action protest will

still take place as planned, but he 
said he expects fewer participants 
because of the new location. 

The regents haveaIsotentatively 
scheduled an affirmative action 
forum on Wednesday, June 14. 

According to UC Office of the 
President Press Relations Officer 
Thomas Debley, a forum is neces-
sary to facilitate discussion between 
students and regents. 

Debley added, however, that the 
regents had not made a final deci-
sion on when the forum will be 
held. 

Gomez said he opposed hold-
ing the forum on June 14, because 
it would fall during finals week at 
most UC campuses. 

"We asked that [the forumJ not 
be done at this time," he said. 

Magpantay agreed, saying that 
while he was pleased ·the regents 
had conceded to student demands 
for a forum, he was disappointed in 
the proposed date. 

"It's a mixed bag of tricks and 
treats," said Magpantay. "They 
conceded to our dem.nd, but it's 
finals week. "

PINION 

Peter Duesberg's AIDS 
theory is worse than 
ridiculous - it's dangerous 

E· arlier this month, UC Berke-ley scientist Peter Duesberg stood before a Hillcrest 
meeting hall crowded with 

people infected with the human im-
munodeficiency virus (HIV) and 
told them that they cannot transmit 
or infect someone with AIDS 
through sex. HIV, he said, does not 
cause AIDS. 

Confined to the world of schol-
arly debate and research laborato-
ries, perhaps this point of view 
could be chalked up as harmless 
ranting - the medical version of 
tbe "Flat Earth Society~ for the 
19905. 

However, as one scientist after 
another lambasted his ridiculous 
hypothesis -that AIDS is caused 
not by HIV but by drug use and 
other factors - the once-presti-
gious researcher became frustrated 
with the scientific community and 
turned to the pub-
lic sphere. 

Researcher Ian Trowbridge in a re-
cent interview. 

Hidden beneath Duesberg's 
laundry list of conspiracy theories 
is an argument so flawed that most 
researchers insist he hasn't a scien-
tific leg on which to stand. The evi-
dence against Duesberg's hypoth-
esis grows stronger every day. 

"The simple fact of the matter 
is the Peter Duesberg isn't a sci-
entist anymore .. . ," said 
Trowbridge, who also teaches a 
class on AIDS at UCSD. "I person-
ally think he 's gone off the deep 
end." 

According to Trowbridge -
and just about every AIDS re-
searcher on the planet - Duesberg 
has made a mockery of the scien-
tific process. Despite having been 
refuted on nearly every point he 
has ever made, Duesberg contin-
ues to claim he isn't being taken 

seriously. But 
why should he 
be? Acting like a 

preacher in a trav-
eling-tent revival, 
Duesberg has 
toured tbe country, 
spreading his 
AIDS gospel. But 
unlike those laugh-
able faith-bealers 
who merely sell 
false hope, 
Duesberg's ser-
mon is deadly 
medicine. 

To tell people 
tbat having sex or 
sharing needles 
does not put them 
at risk of contract-
ing or transmitting 
AIDS is nearly tan-
tamount to shoot-

ing them. Duesberg and his cronies 
may as well hand out death certifi-
cates at the door of the meeting 
hall. 

His advice that people still use 
condoms to avoid other sexually 
transmitted diseases is of little sig-
nificance when his overall message 
is that AIDS is not infectious. 

"He's not only non-scientific, 
he's dangerous," said Salk Institute 

If AIDS were not in the blood-
stream, why then would people be _ 
getting it from blood transfusions? 
According to an article in the De-
cember, ] 994 issue of Science, 
6,888 AIDS cases have been attrib-
uted solely to blood transfusions. 
Even more damaging to 
Duesberg's claims is the fact that 

once blood banks started screen-
'ing out HIV-infected blood in 
1985, the number of AIDS cases 
from contaminated blood dropped 
to practically zero; Only 29 such 
cases have been documented since 
screening began. 

As further proof that AIDS is 
infectious and is transmitted by 
bodily fluids, AIDS in newborn 
babies is only found in cases 
where the mother is infected with 
HIV. 

If AIDS is caused by the use of 
drugs or, as Duesberg has recently 
started arguing, by the AIDS-treat-
ment drug AZT, why are newborns 
getting the disease at all? 

Duesberg and his followers also 
argue that HIV could not possibly 
cause AI DS because there are cases 
ot"the disease in which HIV is not 
present. H~ has documented over 
1,600 such cases in the United 
States. 

The Centers for Disease Control 
(CDC), however, puts the number 
somewhere around 100 worldwide. 
But even if the 1,600 number is cor-
rect, there are still over 360,000 
people in this country with AIDS 
who do have HIV in their blood-
stream. Less than 0.4 percent is a 
meaningless number. 

One of the strangest arguments 
made by the proponents of tbe HIV-
does-not-cause-AIDS quackery is 
that there really is no AIDS epi-
demic. 

Considering that 360,000 are 
known to have AIDS and 200,000 
others have already died from the 
disease, to claim there is no epi-
demic is ridiculous. Fifty thousand 
more Americans are diagnosed ev-
ery year. And we are among the

COMMENTARY: Parking at UCSD is more than <a problem, it's a mission nobody wants _ 
fortunately, there are accessible alternatives 

CONFESSIONS OF AN IIl,EGAL PARKER 
By Ic.en watts 
Contrlbutlnt Opinion Writer 

Every graduating senior likes 
to pass on words of advice before 
graduatiag, I offer a recommen-
dation in response to the many 
gripes about the deplorable park-
ing situation on campus: Don't do 
it. 

But if you must, there are ways 
to escape the fate of the overheated 
drivers who circle the lots in search 
of that rare open space. All it takes 
to make the experience bearable is 
a knowledge of the campus layout 
and a determination to make this 
school work for you. 

Initially, I followed the advice 
given at each orientation: "Don't 
bring a car to school." Orientation 
leaders tell horror stOries about sto-
len and vandalized vehicles. How-
ever, the real horror story is paying 
a high price for a nonexistent park-
ing spot. I eventually decided that 
it would be better to leave the car 
behind. 

So, I walked, shuttled, bussed 
and biked around campus. But af-
ter a year at UCSD, I was ready for 
more freedom of movement. 

It 's not unreasonable for UCSD 
students to want and need vehicles 
during their time here. La Jolla is 
not exactly a college town, nor is 
UCSD a hub of activity. For those 
who live on campus, at some point 
the joys of Porter's Pub, Round 
Table, The Grove, &presso Roma 
and even Black's Beach begin to 

RUN ROLL 

wear tbin. The free bus pass which 
comes with our registration fees is 
only good within the confines of 
University City. This is objection-
able. 

University City is not really in-
fused with youthful spirit. Com-
mercial shopping plazas and con-
dominium complexes are utilitar-
ian, but unfortunately, they are also 
inimical to life and living. Down-
town La Jolla is no bargain, either. 
It's a nice place to stroll, window 
shop and bring visitors, but it's 
priced way of out student range. 
The residents seem to like it that 
way, and because of the distance 
from school, serious student inOu-
ence is minimal. Those who live 
off campus have no choice but to 
drive. 

My second year, possession of 
a car opened up San Diego for me, 
but I paid the price: I dutifully com-
plied with the permit policy. How-
ever, I have since discovered bet-
ter alternatives. For awhile, I 
haunted the remote lots and 
walked. The only difference be-
tween parking on the edge of cam-
pus in a lot and parking across the 
street is the cost. If you time it right, 
Torrey Pines and La Jolla Scenic 
Drive are sure bets. If you're go-
ing fo the Muir or Marshall cam-
puses, La Jolla Farms and the top 
of La Jolla Shores are good for two 
hours. I'm not a big fan of the 
Gilman Drive or Regents Road 
options, but it works for many stu-

dents. Finally, some students park 
in the Ralph's lot and tben walk by 
way of the pedestrian bridge over 
La Jolla Shores Drive. 

But occasionally, one needs an 
easy and immediate access to cam-
pus. Alternative parking strategies 
aren't limited to off campus. If you 

only need short-term parking, 
there's no need to abide by the 
onerous UCSD parking regula-
tions. I discovered this on days 
when I was running late and detour-
ing to the nether lots would have 
resulted in missing half of class. 
However, it's easier than one might 
think to maneuver as close as pos-
sible to your final destination and 
park for free. 

Over the years, I've developed 
a list of best bets which I'd like to 
share. I've tested out the 20-minute 
zones, special lots and even spaces 
not meant for parking. The 20-
minute loading zones are gold. To 
find one, drive toward the building 
you'll be entering and look for the 
closest parking spaces. The zones 
are painted white and clearly 
marked "20 minutes." These zones 
tend to be overlooked for approxi-
mately an hour. Besides being con-
veniently located, they're every-
where. Caution: Remaining over an 
hour and a half is asking for a 
ticket. 

The two most accommodating 
lots, Student Health Services and 
the International Center, are also 
well placed at the center of campus. 
Don't feel guilty, just pull in and 
look confident. Student Health Ser-
vices requires a permit from the 
front desk, but they allow lots of 
time to go in and get that permit. 
How gracious are they? About half 
a day. 

If this lot is full, backtrack to

tbe International Center. Either 
use the 20-minute zones along the 
curb or nestle into tbe lot. It's bet-
ter to do this after the International 
Center volunteers leave for the 
day, because they are a vigilant 
bunch. Even if they reprimand 
you, the parking officers won't, 
and that's what counts. I find a 
scolding preferable to a ticket any 
day. 

According to a tip I received, 
parking officers have declared a 
moratorium on issuing tickets for 
Faculty Club spaces between the 
hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. They 
got into trouble for ticketing lazy 
lunch guests who forgot to display 
their complimentary permits. Ap-
parently, it's easier for the offic-
ers to ignore these cars during the 
'busiest hours than to revoke tick-
ets. 

Use the next tactic sparingly 
and when you're in a daring mood: 
Behave like a special-delivery 
driver. Take the special-delivery-
vehicle prerogative of parking 
where there's no marked parking 
space. If you act as though you 
have a right to be there, parking 
allendants often assume you ' re 
authorized to be there. Good places 
to try this strategy include the road 
leading behind the Old Student 
Center, the Revelle Plaza and the 
patches of dirt around the 
Matthews Administrative/Aca-
demic Complex.

6 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Tuesday, May 30, 1995 

AN OPEN LETTER TO THE A.S. COUNCIL 
Editor: 

I am writing this letter to you, 
the A.S. Council, to express my dis-
may at the decision you made last 
Friday to cut your funding of the UC 
Student Association (UCSA) by 33 
percent. While you have maintained 
your UCSA membership, you have 
still dealt a major blow to 
systemwide student representation, 
affecting not only the 13,800 under-
graduate students you represent, but 
the 3,000 graduate students on this 
campus whom I represent and more 
than lSO,OOO UC students across the 
state. The $6,900 which you are 
withdrawing from UCSA is less 
than one percent of your budget, but 
will result in a five-percent cut in 
UCSA's budget. 
" I am especially disheartened by 

your vote because the arguments 
raised in favor of cutting the UCSA 
b.udget were weak. First, you 
claimed that you could not afford 
the UCSA. Clearly, this is not true. 
While the $ 13,800 A.S. proposed al-
location to UCSA is 1.7 percent of 
its total budget, the Graduate Stu-
dents Association's (GSA) is equal 
to 4.7 percent of its annual budget. 
If you were to restore full funding 
of $1.50 per student to UCSA, it 
would still only be 2.5 percent of 
your budget - one cent out of ev-
ery 40 cents collected. 

Second, you claimed that UCSA 
is inefficient. Given the high visibil-
ity which UCSA has achieved on a 
shoestring budget this past year, I 
find claims of inefficiency highly 
implausible. 

Third, you claimed that the A.S. 
is paying an unfairly high share to 

UCSA. This is the one credible 
claim, but it should be pointed out 
that the average contribution level to 
UCSA is $1.35 per student. Cutting 
UCSD's contribution to 51.00 per 
student docs not bring the A.S. down 
to the average level, but to the mini-
mum. More importantly, you need to 
ensure tbat funding is sufficient to 
provide strong, systemwide repre-
sentation. Four years ago, AS. Presi-
dent John Edson argued that $1.50 
was appropriate and was backed 
overwhelmingly in a vote by UCSD 
undergraduates. Rather than cutting 
back funding, you should work with 
us and assist the GSA in its effort to 
get other stude.,t associations to in-
crease their UCSA contributions. 

Fourth, you claimed that UCSA 
has been hurt by the Smith II. Re-
gents decision, thereby deserving 
less funding. This claim is perhaps 
the most illogical of all. The UC ad-
ministration's interpretation of the 
decision is extremely vulnerable to 
a challenge. Do not forget that the 
UC Office of the President (UCOP) 
is spending your mandatory student 
fees to lobby in Sacramento to ad-
vocate a 50-percent fee increase 
over the next four years, as outlined 
in Gov. Pete Wilson's budget pro-
posal. Its position - that the Smith 
decision does not apply to the 
UCOP, but does apply to us - is 
absurd. To put an end to this double 
standard will be more difficult if 
UCSA's budget is cut. 

The value of your UCSA contri-
bution has not fallen because of the 
Smith decision. You might ask your-
self why the UC administration bla-
tantly misinterpreted Smith to take

away one of UCSA's weapons - its 
ability to hire lobbyists. UCSA sim-
ply responded by making better use 
of the weapons we still have, includ-
ing lobbying the Board of Regents 
and the UCOP, holding marches and 
demonstrations, sending out press 
releases and testifying at state leg-
islative hearings. So far, UCSA has 
done very well, which is why, for 
the first time since 1986, there is a 
real possibility that fees won't be 
going up next year.

To Know the F.eta 
Editor: 

After reading the Editorial 
Board's position on this year's Sun 
God Festival ("Thumbs Down to the 
Sun God Festival Committee ... ," 
May 18), Heel compelled to clarify 
a few points. 

First, the board is hypocritical: 
After all its complaints about the 
quality and variety of music on cam-
pus, in particular rap and hip-hop 
music, it continues to find any band 
presented as unsatisfactory and 
faults the committee "for failing to 
acquire at least one well-known band 
for the festival." In addition, because 
the Editorial Board has never heard 
of Pharcyde or any of the other 
bands, it unfairly dissociated them 
from the "quality, up-and-coming 
entertainers" of past Sun God Festi-
vals.1f the Guardion Editorial Board 

Cln't recognize Pharcyde as one of 
the premier emerging acts in the 
world of rap and hip-hop, then per-
haps its members should step outside 
their office and ask the rap and hip-
hop music listeners on campus about 
these musicians. 

The editorial also stated tbat this 
year's Sun God Festival was 
"plagued by mismanagement and 
bad acoustics." lam appalled that the 
board would make these stateinents 
before the actual event had taken 
place, especially at a venue wbich 
has Dever been used. F~rthermore, 
it is an insult to me and all those in-
volved witb the Sun God Festival, 
who have spent countless hours pro-
ducing tbe event, that the board 
would call an event "mismanaged," 
since it received the highest atten-
dance of any past Sun God Festival. 

In general, I am amazed at the 
Guardian's ignorant, irresponsible 
journalism and lack of research in 
dealing with A.S. Programming is-
sues. For all its ranting and raving 
throughout the year, not one mem-
ber of the Editorial Board or any of 
the Guardian staff has, of his own 
initiative, ever made any specific 
inquiries into the booking process 
or concert production at UCSD. One 
ultimately wonders where the board 
receives its information and who de-
termines fact from fiction. Granted, 
the Editorial Board reserves the 
right to say whatever it wishes, but 
if it can't produce five lines of re-
sponsible journalism through proper 
research, then it shouldn't bother 
saying anything at all .

DEADLY: 
Madman's ego

Continued from PIlle 4 
lucky countries. 

In other parts of the world, HIV 
infection rates are skyrocketing. As 
many as ) 2 million people are in-
fected worldwide. In Uganda, 
60,000 people will die this year and 
that death rate is doubling every 
year. In some areas, over 60 percent 
of the population 'is infected with 
HIV. 

At one time, Duesberg may have 
raised some good questions about 
AIDS research. Questions should be 
continually raised, especial\y since 
over $35 bilIion have been spent on 
AIDS research in the United States 
to date. But he has been proved 
wrong so many times and in so 
many ways that the argument has

the enemy. The latest in parking-
enforcement innovation is using 
Community Service Officers 
(CSOs) to issue tickets. At least it's 
easy to establish rapport with them. 

grown tiresome. 
Apparently. it is not enough for 

Duesberg to be wrong. He must 
also place the lives of other people 
in jeopardy by spreading his ludi-
crous theory. If his message weren't 
so dangerous, perhaps it would be 
okay to let him continue running 
all over the country, yelling and 
screaming like some annoying 
four-year-old who didn 't get the toy 
he wanted. 

But Duesberg is not only selIing 
false hope to groups of HIV·infected 
people who are desperate for good 
news, he is creating a deadly situa-
tion. By claiming that AIDS cannot 
be spread by sex and that the drug 
AZT - which can actually extend 
lives by years - causes the disease, 
Duesberg is seriously undermining 
the health of HIV-infected patients 
who decide to avoid medical treat-
menl. 

Scientists have kooky ideas all 

I asked one CSO whether he had 
reservations ahout citing his peers. 
He rationalized that we should be 
grateful for the improvement: CSOS 
are more lenient and understanding 
than the regular staff. A second CSO 
confirmed this, and he seemed em-
barrassed to admit that ticketing was 
part of bis job. CSO No. 1 had no 
qualms, though. When he encoun-

the time. They share them with col. 
leagues and friends. If the idea 
shows promise, perhaps they do a 
bit of research. 

However, Duesberg has stopped 
trying to convince real scientists 
about his theory and instead has 
taken his show to the public. To the 
average citizen who knows very 
little about immunology or virology, 
Duesberg's claims seem totally rea· 
sonable. 

But his claims are not reason-
able - they're a crock. There is no 
huge conspiracy or cover-up by 
AIDS researchers who don't want 
to jeopardize their grant money. 
Rather, thousands of scientists are 
work.ing diligently to save lives. 
Critical review of their work is nec-
essary, but the public should not 
take outlandish claims seriously; 
particularly those. of a madman 
bent on the gratification of his own 
ego. 

but reasonable reprimand). He con-
cluded by condemning those 
"elites" who take advantage of the 
2O-minute zones at the expense of 
those who follow the rules. 

However, UCSD's parking re-
strictions need revision. The goal of 
the university should be to encour-
age student access. If the campus 
planners badn't idealized UCSD as 
a medieval fortress, I wouldn't re-
sort to extralegal measures.

CentlnuecI from pep 1 
politicization of the campus -
which should come from here -
then we do a disservice to the ... 
people who had to struggle so this 
place can exist," Aaron said. 

Plans for a multicultural center 
gained momentum last year when the 
Cross-Cultural Coalition (Ccq, a 
group of students, staff and faculty 
members, drafted a proposal demand-
ing the creation of a cultural center at 
UCSD. 

Sparking a heated debate on cam-
pua, the CCC proposal envisioned a 
facility which would focused on 
meeting the needs of 
underrepresented students through 
a variety of academic, outreach and 
cultural programs. 

Opponents of the CCC proposal, 
including a number of A.S. Cocncil 
members, argued that such a center 
would be exclusionary and would 
foster segregation. 

Debate intensified after the Che 
Cafe mural, which depicts several 
civil rights leaders, was vandalized 
with racist graffiti and when the 
Mrican-American Student Union 
invited the Nation of Islam, a con-
troversial black political organiza-

In Feb. 1994, 
Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson assigned a 
task force to review 
the CCC proposal, 
assess opponents' 
criticismsandevalu-
ate cultural centers 
at other universities. 
The task force later 
unanimously ap-
proved establishing 
a center which 
would be "available 
to as broad a cross-
section of students, 
staff and faculty as 
possible, while re-
taining the focus on 
improving the cam-
pus environment for 
underrepresented 
students." 

Gr8CI student eunt. H.ywood ...... her 
story "HI/PPY Uk. Miss s.uy" lit dedlclltlon. 

ThechanceJlorcommissioned the 
center's steering committee, which 
is composed of representatives from 
a number of campus groups, at the 
end of the 1993-94 academic year. 

The approval of the center was a 
long-awaited victory for many stu-
dents, faculty and staff members. 
Past proposals to establish a cultural 

center, including I plan put forth by 
SAAC in 1993, had been rejected by 
the administration. 

"In the dialogue that lead to this 
center, there was tension," said Oa-
sis Senior Learning Skills Counse-
lor Patrick Velasquez. "And I think 
all of us need to continually remind 
ourselves that not all tension is bad .. . 
as long as we stay in dialogue."

Continued from .,..e 20

process. 

"I got out okay, and then I tight. 
ened up in the end," Clark said. "I 
was a little disappointed in my· 
self, but I think that the team did 
very well. I believe it just shows 
that if you have total confidence in 
yourself, you can overcome any· 
thing." 

Not to be outdone by her team· 
mates' performances, sophomore 
Lisa Shepard - racing like a sea· 
soned veteran - snatched up sec· 
ond-place overall in the 1OO-meter 
hurdles. 

Shepard sprinted to a respect· 
able 14.32 time in the dreary condi· 
tions. In the prelims a few days 
before, she set a new school and 
stadium record with an outstanding 
14.29 mark. 

"(Shepard] was beaten by a see 
nior (in the finals]," Salerno said. 
"She' ll be back next year, and she'll 
be a contender. " 

Also putting in a spectacular 
effort on the UCSD women's side 
was senior Kenya Thacker, who 
stormed to a second·place finish 
in tbe triple jump. Her distance of 
31'11.25- was a personal best. Fel· 
low Triton Michele Domico fin· 
ished fifth (37'3") in the same 
event. 

"This meet was very much a team 
effort." Salerno said. "I have to thank

THE [Ynl[ 
SEANRAHIMI 

Boxing Notes: 
R.I.P. to Razor 

My deep respects go to the 
Garcia family in light of its 
son's tragic death. Jimmy 
Garcia, a lightweight boxing 
contender, died last week due 
to blows to the head in a title 
bout versus Lightweight 
Champion Gabrielle Ruellas. 

Boxing experts agree that 
Garcia was an overmatched 
opponent and should not have 
been anywhere near Las 
Vegas, let alone inside the ring 
with Ruellas. Consequently, in 
recent weeks George Foreman 
has come out publicly in 
support of head gear in boxing. 
(Amateurs must currently wear 
head gear to fight.) 

Foreman and supporters 
argue that promoters purposely 
arrange fights so that one 
superb boxer will beat the 
living hell out of an inexperi-
enced fighter. Promoters and 
sponsors want ratings from 
Pay-Per-View, and people will 
only watch blood and knock-
outs. Garcia is a tragic victim 
of the boxing world's need to 
please the public. 

As for me, I feel boxing 
isn't about violence. It is a 
sport of hand-eye coordination 
and strategy. Boxing can go on 
without the innocent murder of 
its young athletes. Put O!l the 
head gear, please. 

But, .on to lighter news: 
He's baaaaack. Yes, that's 
right. Razor Ruddock is back 
in the ring. You ask: Who's 
Razor Ruddock? I'll tell you. 
He's a southpaw heavyweight 
from Jamaica. This weird 
combination makes him my 
favorite fighter. 

First of all, he speaks with 
an accent, which elevates his 
trash-talking to the 
Mohammed Ali level. ("Me 
gonna knock you down son, 
cause me reggae style is the 
best mon.") 

Secondly, Razor is left-
handed and, frankly, I like 
lefties. Fourth, anyone with a 
sharp object as his name 
makes my "favorite athlete" 
list. Finally, Ruddock pos-
sesses some talent as well. He 
is famous for knocking down 
Mike Hakeem Abdul Aziz 
Faraj Mohammed Tyson back 
in 1991. 

I am puzzled, however, 
because Razor hasn't fought in 
two years. His last fight ended 
in a loss to then-champion 
Lennox Lewis. I believe he 
was so embarrassed after 
losing to a British fighter that 
he went into hiding in Canada, 
where he was spotted at the 
Toronto Maple Leafs hockey 
training camp. 

It seems that he had hopes 
of becoming the new Leafs 
goaltender. Yet now that his 
NHL hockey career is over, he 
is focused on gaining the 
heavyweight boxing champi-
onship belt. But even if he 
doesn't get it, I'll still root for 
the one they call Razor.

1995 NCAA DIVISION III TRACK & FIELD CHAMPIONSHIPS

Castner,. Sprowl Take It All 
NCAA&: UCSD sends 
14 athletes and takes 
home two champs 
By Tedd Ladd 
Sports Editor 

Call it "the best possible finish." 
Call it "the most talented team ever 
assembled." Call it "a triumphant 
return for UCSD athletics." 

Call it whatever you want, but at 
last weekend 's NCAA Division III 
National Championships in 
Northfield, MN, the Triton track 
and field team simply ran over op-
posing squads when it counted the 
most. 

And despite pouring rain and 
windy conditions on two days of the 
meet, UCSD's successful statistics 
speak for themselves: The Tritons 
sent 14 athletes to compete in the 
four-day affair, and seven returned 
home with All-American honors. 
More importantly, two were 

crowned national champs. 
But all of these stats were back-

ground noise compared to the sound 
that the Triton men's and women's 

. teams made on the field. The men 
took 14th-place overall and the 
women grabbed sixth, each among 
a crowded field of over 300 compet-
ing schools. lin-
coln University 
took top men's 
team honors, while 
University of Wis-
consin-Oshkosh 
boasted the first-
place women's 
team. 

In fact, UCSD's 
team performance, 
according to Triton 
Head Coach Tony 
Salerno, was "the best combined 
finish in UCSD track and field his-
tory." 

Senior Renee Sprowl, a multi-
event star for the Tritons all sea-

son, provided the 
spark for her 
team during 
Friday's finals 
competition. 
Sprowl hurled 
herself to first 
place in the long 
jump with an in-
credible distance 
of 18'9.25". It 
was a mark that 
soundly bested 
her preliminary 
distance by over 
seven inches. 

"[Sprowl] has 
been a very in-
spired athlete all 
year for us. We 
knew she really 
wanted [first 
place]," Salerno 
said. 

u. C.tner w. the 1,000 MtIoIuII ce.np. 
Sprowl's feat 

was also a per-
sonal best and a 
new UCSD 

school record, making her the first 
of two national champions for the 
Tritons. Perhaps even more amaz-
ing was the fact that Sprowl fouled 
her first two attempts -leaving her 
last jump as the one that meant the 
most. 

"I never dreamed of getting first 
place," Sprowl 
said. "I didn't care. 
With that last 
jump, I just went 
for it." 

On the men's 
side, the definitive 
highlight was -
yes, once again -
J.J. Castner. The 
long-distance mali-
ter, who had a 
record-breaki ng 

regular season for UCSD, took com-
peting to a new level in his favorite 
race, the 5,000. 

Castner pulled ahead from the 
very start of the race, pummeling 
his nearest competition by several 
yards. In the end, his first-place per-
formance and solid, 14:54.28 time 
earned him the title of national cham-
pion. 

"[Castner] was in complete con-
trol," Salerno said. "He was well 
ahead of the pack the entire race." 

Also chalking up a stunning ef-
fort for UCSD was an athlete that 
frequently trained with Castner over 
the course of the season - junior 
Goss Lindsay. A transfer student 
from the University of Oregon, Lind-
say made an immediate impact on 
the Triton running squad this year. 

Lindsay's talent showed on the 
track at Nationals, where he gar-
nered sixth place in the 1,500-meter 
race within the rapid time of 4:00.11. 

"The race was

said. "I started out early, and in the 
end, a few of [the other runners] 
gained on me ... I've got to give a lot 
of credit to my coach, Ted Van 
Arsdale for my success." 

It was a going-away party for 
senior Ernest Clark, who finished 
up his Triton tour of duty at Nation-
als with a bang. Earlier in the year, 
Clark's doctor diagnosed bim with 
an arthritic hip problem that affected 
his flexibility as a runner. 

Clark, however, proved he was 
above it all. He dashed to a light-
