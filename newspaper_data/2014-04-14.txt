UCSD Housing, Dining and Hospitality Services announced several changes to on-campus housing for the 2014–
15 school year, including a reduction in the 
housing guarantee for freshmen from four 
years to two years and new “mini double” 
room options for dorms and apartments , 
based on the temporary doubles created for 
overflow in 2013-14.

The changes were announced on the HDH 
website on April 14 and marked an end to the 
four-year guarantee given to the freshman 
classes that entered in Fall 2012 and Fall 2013. 
The freshman class that entered in Fall 2011 
received a three-year housing guarantee.

According to a contractor at the HDH 
office, freshmen entering Fall Quarter 2014 
will be given a two-year guarantee of on-cam-
pus housing, while transfer students will be 
given a one-year on-campus housing guaran-
tee. However, class of 2018 Regents Scholars 
entering in Fall 2014 will still have a four-
year guarantee of on-campus housing. HDH 
managers were not available to comment on 
the changes.

The changes are a reaction to an increased 
housing demand after a record-high 5,228 
freshmen registered to attend UCSD in 2013–

2. Student Transportation Advisory Committee
3. Mandated 29% return to financial aid

Mayor Kevin Faulconer unveiled 
his budget for the city of San Diego 
on Monday, set to take effect this 
July for the upcoming fiscal year. 
The $2.97 billion budget reflects an 
increase in the city’s revenue and will 
be mostly spent on infrastructure 
projects that include transportation 
and construction.

The budget will also bring San 
Diego to 14 percent in reserve funds, 
the first time since the Great Recession 
that the city has met its goal.

Faulconer believes that his bud-
get includes essential spending to 
bring services back to their pre-
recession levels.

“Simply put, this nearly $3 bil-
lion budget returns City Hall’s focus 
to San Diego neighborhoods and 
puts our vision for one San Diego 
to work,” Faulconer said in a KUSI 
article. “City Hall is now saving mil-
lions of dollars and generating new 
revenue. Now, it’s time to put those 
savings back into our communities.”

Highlights from the budget include 
an allocated $1.5 million for libraries 
to extend their hours after facing heavy 
operations cuts in recent years. Under 
the proposal, branch libraries will be 
open four more hours per week, while 
the Central Library will be open five 
more hours every week.

The budget also includes over $1 
million to fund two new firefighter 
academies, offering some relief to the 
department which has faced manda-
tory overtime in the past. The police 
department, which often sees officers 
leaving for higher paying jobs in North

The $2.97 million budget

International Student Program Aims to Double Participation
The International Triton Transition Program will feature field trips and writing workshops at UCSD Extension.

The UCSD International Center 
plans to accept 160 students for its 
newly developed International Triton 
Transition Program. Now in its third 
year, the summer transition is expect-
ed to double its number of partici-
pants from 80 students last year due 
to a series of curriculum changes and 
aggressive marketing campaigns.

According to a press release from 
the International Center, ITTP is a 
four-week transition program for 
international students that cost $1,500. 
This fee covers the expenses of aca-
demic writing workshops, American 
culture presentations and social tourist 

field trips designed to help internation-
al students integrate into the UCSD 
community. 

The program was originally 
designed and intended for 160 inter-
national students to participate; how-
ever, the International Center was only 
able to attract 80 students in the first 
two years.

This year, after a series of aggressive 
campaigns, ITTP was able to attract 
more students and expects more appli-
cations for the program. 

The International Center wants to 
expand the program in the future and 
make ITTP a long time transition pro-
gram to international students. 

UCSD International Student 

Advisor and ITTP Program 
Coordinator Gabriela Hoffmann said 
that the program has undergone dra-
matic curriculum changes since its 
inception.

“We have completely revamped 
the writing program,” Hoffmann said. 
“The class is being taught from a gram-
mar level from UC Extension instruc-
tors versus it being taught by UCSD 
faculty and TAs teach[ing] about ana-
lytical writing instead of vocabulary 
and grammar.”

Assistant Director of Warren 
College Writing Program Dr. Holly 
Bauer and the Mandeville Writing 
Center Director Madeleine Picciotto 
worked with the International Center 

to redesign the new curriculum in 
2012. This year’s program will have 
a few modifications from last year to 
prepare international students for UC 
level writing. 

“We will always make small chang-
es,” Bauer said. “We are going to sub-
mit papers through TED, which is dif-
ferent from last year, and we are going 
to try and use some of the open source 
material that is available to students for 
free online.”

The International Center credits 
the program’s development to its new 
and aggressive marketing strategy.

14, a 14-percent increase from the 
previous year. Transfer registration 
also rose 21 percent. All of these 
students were offered the same 
housing guarantee.  

The changes reflect a reduc-
tion in what some have referred 
to as “all-campus housing,” hous-
ing for students from all six col-
leges that is not reserved solely for 
freshmen, sophomores and trans-
fers. This year, “all-campus housing” 
was available in apartments in Earl 
Warren College, Sixth College and 
the Village, but next year, all-campus 
housing will be limited to juniors 
and seniors eligible for a “Loyalty 
Program” that will allows them to be 
housed in the Village, according to 
the HDH website. Students will be 
allowed to participate in the Loyalty 
Program unless they have breached 
their housing contract, according 
to Revelle College Residential Life 
Administrative Assistant Amber 
Valdez. A “breach” in the contract 

can occur if a student moves off 
campus at any point during the years 
of the guarantee, summer sessions 
not included.

According to UCSD News Public 
Information Officer Christine Clark, 
UCSD does not yet have an estimate 
of how many freshmen and transfers 
will register to attend in 2014–15, as 
Statement of Intent to Register forms 
are not yet due until May 1.

“Housing-Dining-Hospitality 
expects continuing eligible students 
will not be tripled and will have 
standard room configurations avail-
able to them for room selection,” 
Clark said.

On-campus housing will only be 
available to students who qualify for 
the housing guarantee during the 
next academic school year. Those 
who qualify for continued housing 
include students who were given the 
four-year guarantee and transfers 
who were given the two-year guar-
antee, according to Valdez.

According to Reslife staff, HDH 
informed returning students this 

week whether they qualified to live 
in on-campus housing in 2014–15.

“Students eligible for on-campus 
housing were given a postcard with 
their name, which tells them to 
check the HDH website [for their 
housing options],” Valdez said.

In 2013–14, 13,000 students 
lived in on-campus housing, and 
approximately 300 freshmen who 
entered in Fall Quarter 2013 were 
placed in “temporary” doubles — 
rooms designed as singles but con-
verted to house two students. In 
Muir College, desks were installed 
in common areas to accommodate 
students because there was not 
enough space for two desks in the 
temporary doubles.

Other students were housed 
in storage rooms in Revelle and 
Muir that were converted into dorm 
rooms to house students. Muir 
freshman Bernabe Perez, who was 
placed in one of these converted 
doubles in Muir College this fall, 
said that his room was smaller than 
other rooms in Muir and had visible 

pipelines and as well as industrial 
material on the ceiling.

The “mini double,” which will 
be offered to students entering Fall 
2014, is identical to the temporary 
doubles that students were placed 
in this year due to overflow, accord-
ing to Marshall College Lower 
Apartments Resident Adviser Carol 
Lunegas. However, the HDH web-
site does not specify the size of the 
triples or the mini doubles, although 
it does list the size of both regular 
double and single rooms. It also 
does not specify whether the mini 
doubles and triples are equivalent to 
any other room size.

“I feel like they’re going to try 
not to put students in [the tempo-
rary doubles if they don’t request 
it],” Lunegas said. “But if there’s 
overflow, I feel like they’re going to 
have to put students in them.”

County cities, would receive $3.2 mil-
lion for an officer retention program, 
as well as $1.4 million for 17 additional 
civilian officer positions.

Police Chief Shelley Zimmerman 
approves of the budget proposal.

“It had to be a balanced approach 
to not only address our recruitment, 
but also our retention,” Zimmerman 
said in a U-T San Diego article.

The city council has been 
mostly receptive of the budget 
thus far, though with some cri-
tiques. According to a CBS 8 story, 
Councilman David Alvarez, who 
challenged Faulconer in the mayoral 
race last year, believes the proposed 
budget is inefficient and wasteful and 
could easily be streamlined. Alvarez 
plans to push for funding for three 
parks to be built in disadvantaged 
neighborhoods — an item currently 

not included in the budget.
Faulconer formally presented 

his budget to the San Diego City 
Council on Tuesday, April 15, giv-
ing council members the next few 
months to propose amendments. A 
budget needs to be approved by June 
in order to take effect at the start of 
the fiscal year on July 1.

Council Will Use Mandated 
Reserves to Fund Programming

Tensions were high today as I 
walked into the A.S. Council meet-
ing to find the room completely filled 
with passionate students, all waiting 
to speak on behalf of their student 
organizations. They wanted A.S. to 
dip into the Mandated Reserves and 
fund their respective events.

A.S. Council has never seen so 
many different 
members from 
student organiza-
tions collaborat-
ing for the same 
cause. Tears were 
shed, walls were broken and emotion 
reverberated throughout the room.

MEChA member Aimee Nava 
spoke out on how MEChA has helped 
her assimilate into UCSD and how 
cutting funds for this organization 
will cause her to struggle greatly.

“As a student of color, these events 
make me feel like I’m more than a 
number,” Raza said. “I’m not just 
here to learn what the derivative of 
something is. I’m here to learn about 
communities.”

Once input from the public ended, 
the council began its discussion with 
A.S. President Andy Buselt urging the 
council to vote to fund programming 
events for student organizations.

“Tonight’s discussion is important 
because it will shape the Tritons’ expe-
riences for the years to come,” Buselt 
said. “Setting us on a better course 
does not require us to punish students 
in Spring [Quarter] 2013.”

Campuswide Senator Jehoan 
Espinoza commented that this vote 
represents the entire student voice.

“This is the first time in a very 
long time that I see all these commu-
nities coming together for something 
that affects them all,” Espinoza said. 
“To vote for the students or against 
them, that’s what’s happening here.”

VP External Affairs Vanessa 

Garcia stressed that both parties are 
accountable for the lack of funding by 
not participating in the budget pro-
cess earlier in the academic year.

“Not a single student organization 
came [to] the fall meeting of Week 
5,” Garcia said. (Week 5 is when the 
budget is set.) “Student organizations, 
I wish you would’ve been active in 

coming to those 
meetings rather 
than us trying our 
hardest now to 
come up with a 
solution that may 

or may not be there.”
Revelle Senator Marco Vasquez 

disagreed with the vote on the mea-
sure that a 40-percent “dip” into the 
Mandated Reserves should only be 
used in a state of emergency.

“If we go through with this [vote] 
it will set the precedent that we have 
an obligation to fund all requests,” 
Vasquez said. “From my understand-
ing, the bylaws are being violated.”

The bylaws require that the 
Referendum be passed with a three-
quarters vote from A.S. Council. 
However, the council was attempting 
to bypass the bylaws to allow a major-
ity vote on the Referendum, increas-
ing the chance for drawing from the 
Mandated Reserves to pass.

APSA President and SAAC 
Representative Mason Fong spoke on 
the issue of transparency and how the 
fiscal guidelines must be stricter and 
clearer to all.

“We’re basing our programs off 
of last year, and we assume that the 
budget is the same,” Fong said. “If 
next year the budget is smaller, we 
will cut our programs. But please 
take social precedence into account 
with fiscal precedence.”

The vote passed, and $60,000 
will be drawn from the Mandated 
Reserves for programming.

keting campaign using email blast 
from admissions,” Hoffmann said. 
“We also advertise at [overseas 
alumni recruitment events, such 
as] Triton Day China, which the 
Chancellor also attended and [other] 
various students organizations, press 
release and [social media] and [at] 
individual colleges.”

Even though it is only the program’s 
third year, the International Center 
expects positive academic results for 
program participants. There is a five-
year benchmark for the statistics to 
reflect the impact of the program on 
students. Thus, the data on the pro-
gram’s results cannot be released for 
another two years.

Housing for ITTP participants var-
ies every year depending on the avail-

ability of summer housing. This year, 
students will be staying at the residen-
tial dorms in Marshall College.

The program officially starts on 
Aug. 24, 2014 and ends on Sept. 19, 
2014. Applications for ITTP are due by 
Thursday, May 17, and decisions will 
be finalized by May 30.

▶  Over 20,000 Attend Triton Day: 
UCSD’s third annual Triton Day drew 
more than 20,000 newly admitted stu-
dents and families to attend infor-
mation sessions, social events and a 
display of student organizations on 
Library Walk and throughout cam-
pus. 250 student and staff volunteers 
worked at Triton Day, along with 172 
volunteers from the campus initiative 
organization Volunteer50, the highest 
amount the organization has sent to a 
single event since 2010, according to 
the UCSD News Center.

“I volunteer every year  for Triton 
Day, and it’s a lot of fun,” UCSD alum-
na Dr. Elaine Tanaka ’97 told UCSD 

News Center. “I enjoy meeting the 
new students and learning about where 
they are going.

▶  Calif. Drought Drives Up Cost of 
Food: A severe drought in California 
resulted in drastic inflation in food 
prices, according to NBC San Diego. 
A new study shows that produce prices 
could dramatically increase in the near 
future. Prices of crops like lettuce could 
go up as much as 62 cents, and an avo-
cado’s cost may increase by 35 cents.

Carol Benevidez of open-air mar-
ket Windmill Farms in San Ramon, 
Calif. explained that price inflation 
could be a result of a combination of 

unpredictable weather and the drought 
in January. According to Benevidez, 
farmers either cut back on crops or 
declined to plant due to the drought. 
As a result, grocers had to import crops 
to meet consumer demands.

▶  “Blood Moon” Seen in Total Lunar 
Eclipse: A total lunar eclipse was vis-
ible in North and South America just 
after midnight on Tuesday, according 
to U-T San Diego. The eclipse was the 
first of 2014 and occurred when the 
moon began to slip into Earth’s shadow 
on Monday at around 10 p.m., turning 
from silver to copper to copper-red 
over five-and-a-half hours.

Don’t Let 
Algorithms 
Make You A 
Shopaholic

I’ve come to realize that online shopping isn’t as great as we all originally thought it would 
be. Shopping online is usually con-
venient and lets you avoid the lazy 
sales associate who promises to 
“check the back” for more inventory 
but in reality takes a self-declared 
break. (Trust me — I worked in 
retail; I know their secrets.) But I’m 
sad to say that I’ve found its fault. 
Online shopping is just too over-
bearing; it has left me weak, feeling 
like a pathetic shopaholic with a 
sad, overused credit card.

I spent last week debating 
whether I should order an over-
priced Free People dress online. 
After hours spent surfing the Web 
and comparing different sites for 
the best deal, I reluctantly decided 
against purchasing it. I came to the 
decision that it was expensive and 
that I didn’t need it. But algorithm-
based advertisements kept virtually 
attacking me on every website I 
visited by showing me images of 
various colors of the dress I had 
just “rejected.” I honestly couldn’t 
help but cave and buy the dress in 
two colors, along with a highly-
recommended slip and a “Sunshine 
Yellow” bralette.

Though online shopping seems 
like a laid-back experience, targeted 
ads make online shopping very 
aggressive. Unlike the traditional, 
“live” shopping experience — in 
which you walk into the store, 
get greeted and sales-stalked by 
an associate — when you choose 
to shop online, you never get to 
escape and respectfully refuse a 
purchase. Once you show any inter-
est in a product, it’s like the entire 
Internet has joined forces to make 
you buy it. Targeted advertise-
ments that use tracking data col-
lected from your web history and 
IP address are created with the sole 
purpose of convincing you that 
you’ve made a huge mistake and 
that you really need to keep seeing 
the product over and over again to 
make a better decision about it.

I’m anxious for the arrival of 
my order, but I’m also thoroughly 
annoyed because I know those 
“personalized“ advertisements real-
ly affected my decision to splurge 
and purchase the dress. Had I not 
been bombarded with images of 
the dress in every single color, I 
would not have been continuously 
tempted (or more appropriately, 
harassed) to buy it and would have 
been able to reject the idea of own-
ing the dress. 

While this is very much a Big 
Brother-esque data collection and 
privacy problem, the solution does 
not have to be boycotting online 
shopping completely and busing 
to UTC each time to get your Free 
People fix. As a college student, this 
really isn’t practical as the quarter 
goes on. I know I don’t have time to 
go to the mall if I’m swamped with 
work, but I also don’t want to outfit 
repeat any more than I already do.

So, here are some options to 
avoid becoming even more of a 
poor college student: practice self 
control and resist tempting offers 
of 50 percent off Sperry’s, or down-
load a reliable (and credible) adver-
tisement blocker. All the money 
you save can go towards your 
future corgi.

BY ROBBY BOPARAI

I would like to first say I am honored 
and very thank-
ful to have been 
elected the A.S. 
President for 
the 2014–2015 
academic year. 

I am excited to work with the dedi-
cated members of my slate, as well 
as the newly-elected college council 
presidents/chairs and senators over 
the next year. I see countless oppor-
tunities for joint events between the 
Associated Students and the college 
councils and aim for these entities 
to be brought closer together while 

respecting the college councils’ deci-
sions to serve students as they see fit. 
One of Tritons Forward’s main visions 
for A.S. Council was to rebuild its 
relationship with the college councils, 
and now that we have been elected, 
I am confident that, as the newly 
appointed A.S. Council, we will fight 
to ensure that this happens. 

Over the past few years, it has 
become increasingly obvious that 
attendance is dwindling at our weekly 
meetings and that some members 
of Council have not completed the 
expectations required of them, such 
as mandatory senator projects. One of 
my goals for this next year is to ensure 
that all members of Council are fulfill-
ing requirements by having a more 

visible system of tracking projects and 
attendance to ensure that the student 
body is aware of what Council mem-
bers have completed on a frequently 
updated basis.

UCSD students are currently fac-
ing many prevalent issues, including 
Sun God Festival health and safety, 
student organization funding and the 
transportation referendum. I am pos-
itive that the incoming A.S. Council 
will prioritize student input and feed-
back to ensure that we are being as 
transparent with the student body as 
possible in dealing with these issues 
and any others that we encounter 
during our term. It is important to 
focus on what benefits the students, 
which is something I think has been 

lost with miscommunication and 
disagreements between different 
campus entities.

We have seen an extreme need for 
a financial restructuring of the A.S. 
Council, particularly when it comes 
to specific events and services such 
as the Sun God Festival and student 
organization funding. Beyond that,

Looking Forward

The Tritons Forward elections sweep creates promise for a partisanship-free 
A.S. Council that can turn its ambitious goals into action on campus.

In an unprecedented sweep of all executive, campuswide and academic positions on A.S. Council, the Robby 
Boparai-led Tritons Forward slate has offi-
cially taken the fourth floor of Price Center 
in a blaze of red shirts, big ideas and the 
support of more than half of campus vot-
ers. Boparai and his pals campaigned on 
ambitious goals of financial stability and 
student involvement, and will now have the 
opportunity to act on their plans.

As Spring Quarter 2014 progresses, 
the candidates will become council 
members with the opportunity to change 
this campus. Strong leadership from 
the Tritons Forward team will be criti-
cal as issues like transportation and the 
Sun God Festival’s future demand more 
urgent solutions. We expect high pro-
ductivity from the 2014–15 Council, as 
they should not run into any slate-based 
political gridlock while addressing cam-
pus issues. 

The new Council roster shows a piv-
otal transition period for A.S. Council. 
With the constitutional changes in place 
for 2015–2016, Igor Geyn will serve 
as the final elected VP Finances and 
Resources, as the spot will become an 

appointed position beginning next elec-
tion cycle. Meanwhile, Amber Hawthorne 
has an opportunity to set a precedent 
for the new VP Campus Affairs position 
that replaced VP Student Life and the 
expanded responsibilities that it entails. 
VP External Affairs Allyson Osorio may 
also start a closer, productive relation-
ship between UCSD and the University of 
California Student Association. A clean 
slate lies before the new members of 
campus leadership, and there is plenty of 
work to be done.

Last year, when current VP External 
Vanessa Garcia was elected as one of the 
only candidates not from the Keep it REAL 
slate, the UCSD Guardian was optimis-
tic and hopeful for bipartisan actions in 
Council chambers and that the aggres-
siveness of the 2013 election would not 
translate into slate-based biases. While 
Garcia did make a significant error, we 
couldn’t help but conclude that the stand-
off between Keep it REAL and Garcia 
and the push to impeach her early in Fall 
Quarter 2013 was motivated by ideological 
(and slate) differences. Unfortunately, this 
resulted in a drama that took up a sizable 
portion of the already short council terms.

Elected Leaders Should Avoid Slate Bias in AVP Appointments

While Tritons Forward won’t see 
any unfriendly faces on the all-cam-
pus side of the Forum, Boparai’s slate 
will need to work with the 10 new 
senators — soon to be bumped up 
to 12, as soon as Eleanor Roosevelt 
College representatives take their 
seats — provided by the college 
council elections. These individuals 
will also have equal say in campus 
affairs in the coming year. Both John 
Muir College Senator-elects Brianne 
Logasa and Taylor Valdivia won their 
seats through running on the Muir 
College-specific GLAD slate — a 
slate that formally endorsed Tritons 
Forward rival Let’s Act!. While slate 
politics alone won’t pose a real threat 

to the Tritons Forward ultra-majori-
ty, we hope that Council leaders will 
keep to their pledge of diverse opin-
ions and non-partisan, pragmatic 
approach to campus issues.

When the time comes for the 
executives to select members of 
their cabinets in the form of the new 
class of associate vice presidents, we 
hope there aren’t any biases against 
prospective AVPs that ran under the 
Let’s Act! flag. Should they decide 
to apply for AVP jobs, talented and 
experienced Let’s Act! leaders like 
Kyle Heiskala and Eden Berdugo 
would make phenomenal additions 
to the duty-specific areas of Council. 

Council unity will be critical 
from day one as it will be the new 
A.S. Council’s job to promote the 

Week 8 special election for the trans-
portation referendum. Last week’s 
general election notched an abysmal 
23 percent voter turnout; this barely 
exceeds the minimum percentage 
that qualifies a fee increase for pas-
sage. Getting 20 percent of the Triton 
community to the polls for a special 
election during the week following 
Sun God Festival is a daunting task 
that we definitely don’t envy.

But such is the nature of student 
leadership. Tritons Forward and all 
of the other slates ran not for per-
sonal fame and fortune — campus-
wide senator stipends are modest 
at best — but to improve the lives 
of the students on our campus. We 
look “Forward” to seeing that come 
to fruition.

Council can afford to continue offer-
ing services that benefit the students 
on this campus.

Logistics aside, getting students 
excited not only about the student 
government opportunities at this uni-
versity, but also about the events and 
culture of the university is a priority. 
My vice presidents and I intend to 
create a more direct and intuitive way 
of informing UCSD students about 
events and programs that are occur-
ring on campus. Our hope is to pro-

vide the resources necessary to engage 
students and get them involved to fos-
ter a greater notion of UCSD spirit.

I am very excited to have the 
opportunity to be the A.S. President 
of UCSD, and I want to ensure stu-
dents that the other council mem-
bers and I will dedicate this upcom-
ing year to accomplishing our goals 
and pushing ASUCSD forward, as 
well as creating new avenues of stu-
dent input to ensure that the voices 
of students are heard.



WHO: The swooning lyrics and soothing sounds of Jason Mraz give a great balance to the ever-changing, popular music scene. Armed with a guitar, piano, banjo or ukulele, Mraz’s talent and passion for music should make anyone appreciate him as an artist.
WHAT he’s doing now: Mraz is currently working on his fifth studio album “Yes,” along with the rock-folk band Raining Jane.
WHEN he started: 1999
WHERE he’s based: Although originally from Virginia, he gained popularity in the coffee shops of San Diego.
WHY you should listen: Mraz’s music is upbeat; its mellow and his range of songs can fit any occasion.
HOW you’ve heard of him: Whether it’s been the radio, popular television shows or your group of 
friends who break out into “I’m Yours” on occasion, Jason Mraz has been a prominent figure in the music scene since his commercial success in 2008. He was nominated for two Grammys in 
2009 and eventually won two in 2010 for “Make it Mine” and “Lucky,” featuring Colbie Caillat. 
FUN FACT: Mraz embodies a health-conscious lifestyle and his love for this can be seen by the monounsaturated fat-rich avocado farm he owns in Bonsall, San Diego.

WHO: If you’ve been in San Diego 
since 2005, you might remember 
Anya Marina, FM 94/9’s DJ. Her 
work at various San Diegan 
stations buoyed the success of 
her debut full-length “Miss 
Halfway.”
WHAT she’s doing now: Marina 
released her last record, 
“Felony Flats,” in 2012 and 
premiered the video to her 
single “You Are Invisible” on 
HelloGiggles last year.
WHEN she started: 2004
WHERE she’s based: Portland
WHY you should listen: Marina’s 
soothing, yet slightly squeaky vocal 
delivery is hard to compare. Nevertheless, 
her obscure lyrics and eclectic melodic 
palette make her the Regina Spektor or Imogen 
Heap of San Diego.
HOW you’ve heard of her: Her music has been circulating on both small 
and large screens: “Vertigo” was featured in “How I Met Your Mother,” 
and “Satellite Heart” was used in “The Twilight Saga: New Moon.”
FUN FACT: Marina did an acoustic cover of T.I.’s “Whatever You Like.”

WHO: Beginning his music career 
after graduating from Point Loma 
Nazarene University, Laswell has become a staple in indie rock as a singer-songwriter and music producer.
WHAT he’s doing now: On Feb. 11, he released his 
sixth album, “I Was Going To Be an Astronaut.” More 
recently, he was featured on his wife Ingrid Michaelson’s new album “Lights Out.”
WHEN he started: 1998
WHERE he’s based: New York City
WHY you should listen: With the heart-wrenching lyricism of Matt Nathanson and 
bass vocals just a touch lower than Mat Kearney’s, Laswell will become a fast favorite among indie fans.
HOW you’ve heard of him: His acoustic cover of “Girls Just Wanna Have Fun” was on 

“Confessions of a Shopaholic” and was controversially used by “Glee.”
FUN FACT: Laswell did his first gig at Lestat’s. He often swings by San 

Diego during tours, “looking forward to eating Mexican food,” as 
he told the UCSD Guardian.

WHO: Singer-songwriter Dan Layus formed Augustana at the young age of 19 and has continued his career with the band over several years, even as many members have come and gone. 
Layus’s commitment to music has given Augustana depth and time to mature and to come into its own.

WHAT they’re doing now: The band is in the works with an upcoming 
album “Life Imitating Life” set to be released April 22.

WHEN they started: 2003
WHERE they’re based: San Diego

WHY you should listen: Layus sings with passion and writes lyrics with heart, and his music deserves a listen, whether or not you’re interested in his genre. 
HOW you’ve heard of them: Remember ERC’s Rockin’ Roosevelt in 2013? Augustana was the headliner. Even if you weren’t able to attend, there’s a high chance you’ve heard 

its singles like “Boston” and “Sweet and Low” on the radio or on TV shows such as “Scrubs,” “One 
Tree Hill” and “The Big Bang Theory.”
FUN FACT: As of 2011, Dan Layus’s last job on a payroll was at McDonald’s when he was about 17 years old. 

WHO: Since winning a Grammy for Best Contemporary Folk Album in 2003 
with the help of Alison Krauss, Nickel Creek has been renowned for giving 

bluegrass a refined flair.
WHAT they’re doing now: On April 1, they released the album “A Dotted 

Line” for their 25th anniversary, which they will support at a concert on May 20 at Balboa Theatre.
WHEN they started:1989, but took a hiatus starting 2007 until this year.
WHERE they’re based: Vista.
WHY you should listen: Like The Civil Wars, Nickel Creek’s Sara and Sean Watkins’s gentle vocals adorn intricate instrumentals of 

fiddles, mandolins and guitars.
HOW you’ve heard of them: As a testament to the flexibility of their sound, they have been featured in albums of fellow San Diegan band Switchfoot, Dolly Parton and Bela Fleck. 

FUN FACT: Their tune “In the House of Tom Bombadil” refers to an 
obscure but beloved character of “The Lord of the Rings” novels.

S ince making her magical, Theatre World Award-winning Broadway debut as Daniel Radcliffe’s love 
interest in 2011’s “How to Succeed in 
Business Without Really 
Trying,” Rose Hemingway 
has delighted the musi-
cal stage as an adorable 
gamine. But her first ap-
pearance at the Old Globe 
departs from not only mu-
sical theatre but also her 
usual portrayals of sweet-
natured naivete: In the 
family drama “Time and 
the Conways,” she plays 
the haughty, yet fun-loving 
snob, Hazel Conway. 
Hemingway spoke with 
the UCSD Guardian about 
preparing for the role and 
the play’s applicability to 
the modern day.

Guardian: In “Time and 
the Conways,” it really felt 
like you and the rest of the 
cast had known each other 
for a long time. How did 
you all capture that kind of 
dynamic?
Rose Hemingway: What 
was so interesting for us 
in this rehearsal process is 
that a lot of the text work 
and the research we did, 
we brought to the table 
and discussed together as 
a group so that everybody in the cast 
knows everybody else’s backstory 
more intimately than you might 
in other plays. [Director] Rebecca 
[Taichman] was really a believer in 
this, that all the characters would be 

that intimate with each other because 
they’re a family.
G: What has been the greatest chal-
lenge working on “Time and the 
Conways”?

RH: Being away from my husband 
[fellow actor Geoffrey Hemingway]! 
… Other than that, I had a hard 
time initially [with] Hazel. … In a 
lot of ways, she’s kind of an unsavory 
character. … It’s the very first time 

I’ve had the opportunity to work on 
a character that wasn’t the ingenue, 
the protagonist that everybody loves. 
… Initially, I kept trying to make 
her likeable. I had to fight myself — 

“She’s not so bad!” I wanted 
to find these lovely qualities 
in her. … In the end, I hope 
I was able to use those 
instincts to find her inner 
beauty. … It’s been a lovely 
challenge, and I’m glad I’ve 
had the opportunity. Now, 
it might not be so easy be-
ing the sweet, good girl all 
the time!

G: What is your interpre-
tation of the play?
RH: [J.B. Priestley] was 
taking J.W. Dunne’s 
theories on time and us-
ing it to put up a mirror 
for people of that time in 
England, to say, “If this 
is how you value life, if 
you think of yourselves as 
upper class, that … what’s 
important is my wealth 
and my status, this is not 
a way to live your life.” It’s 
more of using [the theo-
ries] as a tool to reflect on 
more tangible values and 
beliefs that [Priestley] held 
as far as politics and soci-
ety and culture went in the 
time. … It was written just 
as World War II was just 

about to begin, so these things were 
probably very, very pressing. … 
It’s so interesting to think he didn’t 
even know how bad it was going to 
get. I think all of those themes can 
still be valued today.

PLAY  REVIEW

Here’s the thing about plays: Un-
like most blockbuster movies, there 
is not one moment when you’re 
allowed to take a mental break. 
There are no chances to “ooh” and 
“ahh” over CGI effects or close-up 
shots. Instead, merely sitting at a 
play seems to enhance one’s acuity, 
as the audience must instead put 
their brains to work by honing in 
on a scene that theatregoers are 
both detached from and close in 
proximity to.

“Time and the Conways” is no 
exception in increasing audiences’ 

IQ scores — its didactic nature 
never bogs down its source material 
in inaccessible intellectualism. Play-
wright J.B. Priestley held a strong 
interest in philosopher J.W. Dunne’s 
theories on time: that at any given 
point, we are experiencing a cross-
section of ourselves, as defined by 
our past, present and future.

“Conways” is a representation of 
those complex theories, yet it is still 
able to appeal to viewers with its 
“Downton Abbey”-esque, exciting 
drama feel (albeit without so much 
soap). Like the television show, 

“Conways” revolves around a well-
to-do British family living in the 
interwar period. In the first act, the 
lighting, Edwardian decor, stunning 
costumes and the Conways’ bubbly 
demeanor introduce a picture-
perfect, quaint family of six loving, 
young adults and their widowed 
mother. But as the play progresses 
into 1937, the Conways’ flaws 
become more apparent. Wracked 
by the Great Depression and the 
impending Second World War, the 
family reveals the skeletons in its 
closet, furthering the unhappiness 
that has been stealthily looming in 
their consciousness since 1919.

With the transitions between 
1919 and 1937, perhaps the big-
gest star of the “Conways” is the 
play’s only set, a sitting room in 
the Conways’ home. Not simply a 
placeholder for the Conways and 
their company, it evokes a strong 
sense of the passage of time and the 
differences between two periods. 
To show the Conways experienc-
ing both their pasts and their 
futures, the set of the cozy room of 

time  and the  conways
The Old Globe gives audiences a timeless 
philosophy lesson without sacrificing a 
poignant story and innovative set design.

Beaches, volcanoes and hula dancing are the typical things that come to mind when think-
ing of Hawaii. What many people 
may overlook is the cuisine, a unique 
blend of American, European and 
Asian food, which explains why it is 
unlikely to find Hawaiian food here 
on the mainland. However, at Leilani’s 
Cafe, it is possible to experience the 
best Hawaiian food Pacific Beach has 
to offer. 

Located in a residential neighbor-
hood, Leilani’s sits on the quiet Cass 
Street and looks as though it could be 
a residence itself. What separates the 
wooden cafe from the homes that sur-
round it is a massive patio out front 
brimming with chairs, tables and 
people. The Hawaiian music playing 
softly in the background is just audi-
ble over the chatter of the customers 
and helps create the easygoing feel of 
the place.  

Leilani’s serves breakfast, brunch 

and lunch and lets you sample 
Hawaiian food in a variety of catego-
ries including “Da Breakfast,” bagel 
sandwiches, lunch plates, “From Da 
Ocean” and noodles. The “Teriyaki 
Hawaiian Style” ($8.50) is a traditional 
Hawaiian lunch plate that features 
Leilani’s famous teriyaki chicken, 
homemade mac salad and white rice. 
The teriyaki was sweet and kept the 
chicken from being dry but did not 
overwhelm the meal as a whole or 
mask the taste of the grilled chicken. 
Instead of cheesy like your typical 
Kraft mac ‘n’ cheese noodles, the mac 
salad was tangy from the vinegar and 
full of mayonnaise. Equally as good as 
the lunch plates is the breakfast. The 
“Jr. Boy Breakfast” ($9) includes sweet 
French toast made on King’s Hawaiian 
bread that refuses to get soggy, fluffy 
eggs, Portuguese sausage and rice. 
The menu also features some classic 
Hawaiian dishes such as the “Loco 
Moco,” a hamburger patty topped 
with two eggs and gravy; “Eki’s Ahi 
Poke,” pieces of Ahi served raw with 
sesame oil and soy sauce; and multiple 
dishes that include spam. Unifying 

the multiple categories on the menu is 
that each meal comes with a staple of 
Hawaiian cuisine: rice.

The white, sticky grain is ideal 
for soaking up the extra parts of 
your meal, whether it be teriyaki 
sauce or the extra maple syrup that 
comes with the French toast. (Who 
knew rice and syrup tasted so good 

together?) The food at Leilani’s is 
straightforward, and its wonder-
ful blended flavors highlight how 
American, Portuguese and Japanese 
cultures have influenced the makeup 
of Hawaiian food. 

Overall, what was most charm-
ing about Leilani’s is its simplic-
ity. Nothing is over the top — not 

the food nor the decorations. The 
appeal comes with Leilani’s modest 
approach, as it captures the laid-back 
Hawaiian vibe while acquainting the 
greater San Diego area with authen-
tic Hawaiian food.

A quick trip down a few flights of cement-paved stairs leads you to a magnificent view 
of the Pacific and an all-too-familiar 
La Jolla Shores Beach. On your left, 
through the piscine smell, swath of 
minute flies and wood-framed glass 
doors, is the fortuitously located but 
subpar Goldfish Point Cafe.

Although the cafe can boast its 
amazing view of the La Jolla Cove 
and proximity to it, the environ-
ment within the cafe is not ideal. The 
pairing of a strong ocean smell and 
seafood works well with an area that 

is selling the sort, but it’s not the case 
for this cafe. The smell is not utterly 
overwhelming, yet it lingers and only 
detracts from a cup of coffee or a 
sandwich ready to be eaten. The occa-
sional flies, which are truthfully out 
of the cafe’s control, may nonetheless 
prove irksome to diners. Cafe lighting 
is understandably provided by wide, 
open doors and sunlight, but overcast 
days aren’t great for diners sitting 
inside or diners unable to get the 
limited outdoor seating. The little-to-
none indoor lighting makes a cloudy 
day evermore dull and gives the cafe a 
less inviting presence. 

Added to the cafe’s persona, or 
lack thereof, is its eclectic mix of 
interior artwork. The collection — an 

assortment of aquatic life and waves 
— would add to the cafe if there was 
some cohesion, even if just in the 
framing. The framed photos, really 
the only splash of color inside the 
cafe, hang lackluster along the walls 
and are easily overlooked. 

The drink menu is a run-of-the-
mill selection at standard prices, 
serving an Americano ($1.75 12 
ounce compared to Starbucks’ $1.95 
12 ounce) down to a White Mocha 
($3.50 12 ounce, Starbucks $3.40 12 
ounce). However, Goldfish Point does 
skimp on flavored lattes if those are 
the types of drinks you’re looking for. 
The Spiced Chai Latte, a weighty $4 
plus tax for a 12-ounce cup, is heavy 
on the foam and standard on the 

spice. The drink is decent taste-wise, 
although it stands at a rather expen-
sive price (compared to Starbucks’ 
12-ounce Chai Tea Latte at $3.25). 
The Cafe Mocha ($3.25 12 ounce 
compared to Starbucks’ $3 12 ounce) 
is less powerful on the additional 
mocha flavor, which would be a ben-
efit to someone looking for a more 
robust espresso expression, but the 
espresso tastes a bit watered down and 
detracts from the drink in its entirety. 
Alongside the coffee that is served, 
Goldfish Point’s menu also serves 
beer and wine and has a slightly more 
creative and extensive food menu. 
Food options are categorized under 
Breakfast, Specialty Sandwiches, 
Salads, Paninis and a Kids Menu. 

Although the food has some fun items 
like the Green Dragon (a roast beef 
sandwich) and Oletea (provolone and 
vegetable sandwich), the items were, 
like the drinks, average in taste and 
average in price.

Overall, Goldfish Point Cafe 
misses its mark with such a prime 
location. The interior feels a bit 
outdated with its worn-down wood 
flooring and seating accommoda-
tions, and the menu is typical at 
best. Like the goldfish you win at a 
carnival, this cafe and its view are a 
short-lived thrill that can be passed 
on and easily forgotten.

slasher  flicks
by avey  tare
Release Date April  8

Avey Tare’s Slasher Flicks aims for B-movie oddity, but the 
results are often frustratingly overdone.

ALBUM  REVIEW

A s a member of Animal Collective, Dave Portner — better known as Avey Tare — has never been afraid to overload the 
senses. His experiments in folk, psychedelic and 
electronic music merge the accessible with the 
strange, leaving a sizable imprint on indepen-
dent music’s propensity to bring together both 
the pop and unorthodox song structure. So 
it seemed fitting that Portner formed Slasher 
Flicks with Angel Deradoorian and Jeremy 
Hyman, former members of genre-bending 
experimental groups Dirty Projectors and 
Ponytail, respectively.

But when Slasher Flicks released “Little 
Fang” from its debut “Enter the Slasher 
House,” many were surprised by its rather 
uncomplicated sound, with a fairly straight-
forward chord progression and drumbeat. 
Inspired by the off-kilter oddity of B-movie 
horror films, the song plays around with 
various vocal effects that shift and phase the 
vocals to emphasize its campy nature. The 
effects are never overbearing, showcasing a 
great ability for restraint.

“Little Fang” created some lofty expecta-
tions for the rest of the album, but unfortu-
nately, the results never quite reach the same 
highs. Its overloaded effects, applied so well 
on “Little Fang,” push the horror film aesthetic 
past its likable novelty to the point of not even 

recognizing the horror genre as an influence 
on the sound. 

The opener, “A Sender,” with a driving 
beat and springy guitar-line, is undeniably 
catchy, but it is difficult to get past the vocals 
drenched in a warbled, water-like veil suppos-
edly intended to inject playfulness into the 
song. “Catchy (Was Contagious)” suffers the 
same fate, with interesting vocal melodies and 
instrumentation that are unable to penetrate 
the dense effects, and tracks like “That It 
Won’t Grow” lack any sense of the structure 
that made “Little Fang” such an earworm.

“Enter the Slasher House” feels overdone. 
This may very well be an intentional homage 
to the over-the-top films Portner was inspired 
by. It is slightly similar to the movies made 
with the specific intention of being so-bad-
it’s-good — forcefully ridiculous instead of 
naturally happening upon the surreal and 
downright bizarre. It never quite feels as genu-
inely fun as the band’s image suggests. “Enter 
the Slasher House” works best when the music 
has some sense of structure and allows room 
for breathing. Sadly, though, the band more 
often than not chooses to suffocate its songs 
with a heavy layer of effects.

staff writer

1919 is moved backward but is still seen by 
the audience through a cold, metal frame of 
1937 mimicking the warm, inviting windows 
and wallpaper of the Edwardian room. The 
emphasis given on the room’s transformation 
itself is immensely inventive, giving a tangible 
illustration of Dunne’s views against a linear 
perception of time.

That is not to say, of course, that the en-
semble cast does not stand out in their own 
right. To make a dysfunctional family likeable, 
the Conways’ chemistry was vital to their 
portrayal on stage — and this production’s 
cast convincingly depicted more than a few 
beautifully complicated relationships.

As these characters experience the 1930s, 
we see their fashions and mannerisms change, 
and — considering the 18-year leap in time — 

we see them age considerably. Because of the 
latter, Hollywood might think “Time and the 
Conways” would be perfect for the big screen. 
After all, why not put actors through hours 
of prosthetics and makeup to look almost 
two-decades older? But at its core, the story 
of a family moving through time is intended 
for the stage and no other medium. In the 
theatre, where actors do a much-appreciated 
curtain call instead of a red carpet premiere, 
we’re able to mull over a play’s message more 
fully and witness such things as two sets 
on one stage teaching philosophy. With its 
weighty matters, “Conways” is more worthy 
of the stage. So don’t expect to eventually see 
a film adaptation of “Conways”. That’s simply 
not in the cards for this play’s future.

TOTALS 

UCSD to Conclude 11-game Road Swing at San Francisco State

freshman outfielder Brandon Shirley 
started the comeback with an infield 
single. Senior infielder Garrett Tuck 
came on as a pinch hitter and drew 
a walk to leave two on base. One 
batter later, now with two away, senior 
catcher Nick La Face took the plate to 
drive a two-run single up the middle. 
Rahn followed with another single 
to push home the tying runner. The 
Tritons held Cal State Stanislaus in the 
home half of the 10th inning to win 
5–4 in extra innings. 

UCSD handily won the seven-
inning nightcap 10–1 with little 
contest. Sophomore infielder Troy 
Cruz went 3-for-4 with two doubles, 
a first for his collegiate career. Senior 
right-hander Blake Fassler lasted 
through five frames on only 54 pitches, 
with two strikeouts and no walks.

The final game of the series featured 
another Triton deficit, this time down 
3–0, but once again, UCSD mustered 

a comeback for the 4–3 win. Cruz 
started on the mound for the seventh 
time this year and allowed three runs, 
hitting one, walking one and striking 
out four. 

Despite the sweep, UCSD wasn’t in 
full form this weekend after losing to 
CBU and playing a more contentious 
series than anticipated against last-
place Stanislaus.    
 “When you get down to the end [of 
the season] here, every game is like 
gold,” Newman said. “The way I put it 
is that we have to keep getting better 
and be the best team we can be come 
the end of the year.” 

UCSD next travels to San Francisco 
today for another CCAA series against 
San Francisco State to close out an 
11-game road stretch. First pitch is 
scheduled for 3 p.m. today, and the 
four game series is set to conclude on 
Saturday, April 19.

with a total of 907. Sonoma State (7), 
Cal State San Bernardino (8), UCSD 
(9) and Cal State San Marcos (10) 
were all only separated by a single-
stroke margin. 

Cal State Monterey Bay came in 
first, followed by second place Chico 
State University and host school Cal 
State Stanislaus in third. 

 Lim was able to move up the 
leaderboards in his final round, 
ending in a three-way tie for 26th, 
with a 10-over 226. Los Angeles native 
Yamaguchi was also able to climb up 
the charts in the final round, tied for 
29th, 11-over 227. 

“Jay [Lim] played quite a bit better 
this tournament,” Yamaguchi said. 
“He has been working hard, and he 
is finally starting to see better results.”

Simon fell seven spots after his final 
round, finishing at 35th, tied with 
fellow Triton sophomore Daniel Yang 

(13-over-par, 229). Sophomore Jeff 
Roseth also finished in a tie at 74th.

The Tritons conclude their season 
next week when they travel to Stockton 
for the CCAA Championship. 

“We’re pretty confident,” Yamaguchi 
told the UCSD Guardian. “We haven’t 
played our best in recent weeks, so 
other teams in the conference might 
overlook us. But we’ve been trending in 
the right direction, [and] we have the 
chance to surprise some people and do 
really well at conference.”

The championship tournament 
will occur from April 21 to 22 at the 
Brookside Country Club. 

“I have never played at Brookside or 
even seen pictures of the course, but I 
heard it’s kind of similar to the course 
in Stanislaus,” Yamaguchi said. “I think 
we will be better prepared and won’t 
have to make too many adjustments.”

No. 24 Tritons lose single game to No. 27 California Baptist 
Unviersity before sweeping CCAA foe Cal State Stanislaus. 

The No. 24 UCSD baseball team fell 8–4 to No. 27 California Baptist University in a non-conference 
game last Wednesday before sweeping 
Cal State Stanislaus in a four- game, 
in-conference series over the weekend. 
The Tritons improved to 25–11 overall 
and 21–7 in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association. UCSD now boasts 
the longest CCAA win streak with 11 
straight in-conference victories.

With the conference championship 
slated for early May, UCSD sits third in 
conference standings, two games ahead 
of fourth-place Cal Poly Pomona. Chico 
State is currently in second, only a game 
ahead of the Tritons, and Sonoma State 
currently leads the conference. 

On Wednesday, UCSD slipped early 
against California Baptist, ultimately 
allowing the underdog Lancers to 
pull away with the upset. The Tritons 
allowed four runs in the first inning to 
CBU and were never able to overcome 
the early deficit. 

Junior southpaw Chad Rieser had an 
especially rough outing on the mound, 
surrendering four runs, three of them 
earned, on three hits. Rieser retired the 
Lancers in order in the second before 
leaving the game. 

Senior outfielder Justin Rahn led 

UCSD’s offensive efforts, going 3-for-4 
on the day. However, the Tritons failed 
to produce consistently clean hits off 
the CBU staff. 

UCSD fared much better in Turlock 
over the weekend against Cal State 
Stanislaus. On Friday, in the first contest 
against Cal State Stanislaus, the Tritons 
matched their season-best offensive 
performance, scoring 13 runs to the 
home team’s four. 

Sophomore right-hander Justin 
Donatella threw his first wild ball of the 
year and allowed four runs on 11 hits in 
the game but still earned his sixth win 
of this season.

In the sixth inning, UCSD widened 
its lead and sealed the victory, sending 
a whopping six runners home, two of 
which were capitalized on Cal State 
Stanislaus’s errors.  

“That’s baseball. That happens. When 
you put the ball in play and make 
the other team play catch, sometimes 
they make mistakes,” UCSD head coach 
Eric Newman told the UCSD Athletics 
Department. “We were fortunate that 
they did.” 

The Warriors allowed UCSD to 
come back from a 4–1 deficit in the 
ninth inning in game one of Saturday’s 
doubleheader. With one out, redshirt

In its final tournament before 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association Tournament, the UCSD 
men’s golf team finished ninth out of 
20 teams at the 41st Annual Hanny 
Stanislaus Invitational. Junior Jay Lim 
was the top Triton finisher, tying for 
26th out of a pool of 100.

UCSD ended day one tied for the 
11th spot, swinging a 608, 32-over-par 
on the par-72, 6,641-yard course. The 
Tritons started off sluggish, shooting 
a 309 in the first round. However, 
after some adjustments in the second 
round, they rallied to shoot a 299, 
moving them from 13th to 11th at the 
end of the day.

“The course we played was a lot 

different from the types of courses 
we are used to,” sophomore Clayton 
Yamaguchi said. “I think it took us 
a while to adjust to this and change 
our game plans, but when we did, we 
played better.”

UCSD senior Lewis Simon was 
the leader of the pack after the first 
day of competition, finishing 28th 
among individuals, with a 7-over-par 
151. Lim and Yamaguchi were not far 
behind, both tying at 34th at the end 
of two rounds.

The following day, the Tritons were 
able to improve by one stroke in the 
third and final round, finishing the 
tournament with a 42-over-par 906. 
UCSD’s one stroke improvement gave 
the Tritons just enough to edge Cal 
State San Marcos, who finished 10th

TENNIS MEN'S  GOLF

Triton men lose to Azusa Pacific 7–2 while San Diego State University defeats women 6–1.

Last week, the UCSD men’s 
and women’s teams both suffered 
tough road losses, with the No. 11 
Triton men falling to Azusa Pacific 
University 7–2 on Friday, and the 
women losing 6–1 to San Diego State 
University on Sunday. The weekend 
tilts put the men at 15–8 overall on 
the season and the women at 8–16 
overall. 

On Friday, the Triton men could 
only muster two match victories — 
one each in the doubles and singles 
— against Azusa Pacific.  

Senior Rajeev Herekar and 
junior Mark Meyer won in the No. 
3 doubles slot, defeating Cougar 
freshmen Pascal Engel and Alan 
Leahy by a score of 8–6. However, 
APU managed to take the No.1 and 
No. 2 tilts with scores of 8–3 and 
8–4, respectively.

Sophomore Horea Porutiu 
recorded the only singles victory 
at the No. 5 slot, overtaking APU’s 
junior Gary Yam by scores of 6–4, 
6–4 in two sets. 

On Sunday, the only win that 
the UCSD women could produce 
against SDSU came on the singles 
side, when senior Tara Vanooteghem 
defeated freshman Kennedy Davis in 
the No. 4 singles through scores of 
6–4, 2–6 and 15–13. 

“The highlight of the match was 
Tara Vanooteghem winning in the 
super tie-breaker in the third [set],” 

UCSD women’s head coach Liz 
Laplante said. “She played probably 
the best she’s played all year. That 
was a real nice thing to see.”  

However, the Tritons fell in each 
of the remaining five singles contests 
in straight sets. 

 On the doubles side, the Aztecs 
swept the UCSD in all three matches. 
The closest contest came in the No. 
1 slot where sophomores Paula Chou 
and Kyra Scott lost 8–6 in a hard-
fought match. 

“It was a really, really good match,” 
Laplante told the UCSD Guardian. 
“They played aggressive. They 
played probably the best doubles 
I’ve seen them play all year. [They] 
both rose to the occasion.”

In the No. 2 and No. 3 slots, 
UCSD failed to tally a single score, 

as the Aztecs shut out the Tritons 
8–0 in both matches. With this loss, 
the Tritons have now dropped four 
straight matches.  

“San Diego State is a really good 
Division-I program,” Laplante 
said. “[Considering] where the last 
half of our season has gone, I was 
really pleased with the way the girls 
performed.”

After the pair of weekend losses, 
the men’s and women’s squads will 
close out their season this week, 
with the men’s team traveling to play 
UCLA on Wednesday, April 16 and 
the women returning to home turf to 
host Cal State Stanislaus on Friday, 
April 18.
