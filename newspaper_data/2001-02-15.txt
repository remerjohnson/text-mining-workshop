Color Conference to Come to UCSD 
Annual event for students of color promotes student activism 
IyAUXJ.LII 
Associate News Editor 

The A.S. Council , in conjunction with the 
UC Student Association, will host its annual 
Students of Color Conference Friday in the 
Price Center. . 

The theme of this year's conference is "The 
Politics of Silence: Establishing a Voice at the 
Crossroads of the New Millennium." 

According to organizers of the event, the 
meme encompasses one of its main goals: to 
encourage more students, particularly those 
who are typically under-represented, to become 
active voices in their community. 

"It's going to be a beautifu l thing having all 
these people coming together," said A.S. Vice 

. President External Eugene Mahmoud. "But 
ultimately you'd want to see even more infu-
sion of students of color in th ings like student 
organizations and governments." 

The origins of the conference were at UCSD 
12 years ago. In 1990, UCSD hosted the first 
conference to create a forum in which students 
could have open discussion with one other 
about issues concerning higher education with-
in the contexts of race and ethnicity.

Sophomores Will 
Need to Find 00-
Campus Housing 
Rate of second-years 
living on campus to drop 
By MARGARET O'NEIU 
Staff Writer 

For the first time, UCSD is nO! guaran-
teeing its second year student on-campus 
housing. Approximately 35 percent of con-
tinuing second year students will be housed 
on campus for the 2001-2002 school year, 
an immense drop from this year's 80 per-
cent. 

The reason for the change is the 
University of California's need to accommo-
date 1,000 to 1,500 more students over the 

• its eight campuses. 
UCSD is already behind in numbers 

from last year, when it only filled 3,200 of 
3,500 spots. The university is admitting 
more freshmen for next year to make up for 
this and to compensate for the additiooal 
freshmen being admitted into the entire 
system, which has created the housing 
crunch. 

"UCSD is in a planned growth mode as 
part of the UC system: said Muir Resident 
Dean Pat Danylyshyn-Adams. 

There are about 5,1PO beds available on 
campus, while the total undergraduate 
enrollment is around 17,000. Typically, 90 
percent of incoming freshman accept on-
campus housing, according to Director of 
Housing and Dining Services Mark 
Cunningham. 

The current first -year class was admitted 
with the knowledge that they would not 
have guaranteed second-year housing. 
Cunningham said this was decided upon 
last year around this time so potential fresh-
men could be notified that they would not 
have the guarantee. 

Some first-year students believe that they 
were misled to believe that they would have 
a chance of living on campus similar to that 
of past years. 

"I don 't think they gave us fair warning

Awareness Week Aims to Educate Students 
Student health advocates show people how to protect themselves against STO's 
., STEVE LEHTONEN 
Staff Writer 

In recognition of Valentine's 
Day, health advocates across the 
United States rallied to support 
Condom Awareness Week. 

Despite the rain , Student 
Health Services manned an infor-
mation booth on Library Walk 
Tuesday to support sexual health 
awareness. Condoms and other 
forms of sexual protection were 
handed out to students. 

Student Health Advocate 
Natalie Lamb spoke of the need for 
increased awareness of the dangers 
of unprotected sex. 

"The purpose of the awareness 
week is not to push condoms," 
Lamb said . "People are already 
using them and we waht them to 

be aware of the different options 
available. There are many miscon-
ceptions mat need to be under-
stood." 

Among the misconceptions 
noted by the advocates were mis-
understandings of the correct 
functions of protection. 

"Many people don't understand 
how to be safe," said Sara Working, 
a student health advocate and 
Marshall senior. "For example, 
many condoms are made from 
lamb intestines which can be used 
as birth control but not for protec-
tion against sexually transmitted 
diseases such as the AIDS vi rus." 

Advocates cited other protec-
tion failures such as using two con-
doms, misconceiving oral sex as David Pill/Guard,an

UCSD Study Finds Gene 
Therapy Effective In Mature 
Monkeys 

UCSD School of Medicine researchers have 
built upon earlier research with brain cells to 
report that degenerate brain fibers in older mon-
keys can be restored using -genetically altered 
tissues that have been modified to create a 
nerve growth factor, which is found in all verte-
brate animals. 

The fibers, which are called axons, carry 
messages through the brain and are affected in 
Alzheimer 's Disease. The researchers believe 
their discovery could lead to a possible treat-
ment for that disease. They have since received 
approval from the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration to develop an Alzheimer's treat-
ment and are currently seeking human subjects. 
The researchers published their results, which 
describe the work they did with 18 rhesus mon-
keys ranging from 9 to 27 years Old, in the Feb. 
13 issue of the "Proceedings of the National 
Academy of the Sciences.· 

UCSD and San Diego

- ·interested in subjects relat ing to San Diego 's 
history and culture. 

The network will present its plans for its first 
task, a 120-page directory of San Diego's his-

torical resources, at its first meeting to be held 
Feb. 20 at the Museum of Man in Balboa Parl<. 
The directory will be posted online in the Mure. 

The first series of meetings will unite local 
scholars and citizens to talk about issues con-
cerning San Diego and will address the level of 
regional knowledge possessed by San Diego res-
idents. 

Speakers at the meetings will include Robert 
Witty, the director of the San Diego Historical 
Society, Bruce Linder, a naval historian and 
author, Mark Spalding, a UCSD professor and

intrinsically safe from virus trans-
mission and using improper lubri-
cants, such as petroleum jelly or 
whipped cream, which dissolve the 
latex condom. 

Working explained some incor-
rect assumptions about oral sex. 

"Many people think that oral 
sex is safe: Working said. "The 
only requirement for the virus to 
exist is a warm, moist area." 

Working promoted the prac-
tice of using a dental dam, a pro-
tective latex covering for male and 
female genitalia , to prevent the 
transmission of disease during 
oral sex. 

The table also offered games 
and trivia intended to educate peo-
ple on sexual safety. Students gath-
ered to play "Pin the condom on 
the man." 

Students found the distribution 
of condoms and the games either 
amusing or embarrassing. 

Health advocates aimed to erase 
these' sentiments. Debbie Pino-

Saballett, outreach coordinator for 
Student Health Services, spoke of 
the need for increased awareness 
without shame. 

"Many people find the table 
offensive," Pino-Saballett said . 
"The goal is actually to desensitize. 
If we do some games with con-
doms, maybe when they need them 
they won't be so offended." 

The group also wanted to stress 
the week as "Latex Awareness 
Week" as opposed to "Condom 
Awareness Week: so as not to dis-
criminate against relations in 
which latex protection takes a dif-
ferent form. 

"Latex should be used among 
lesbians as well: Pino-Saballett 
said. 

Pino-Saballett has worked in 
sexual education since 1988. For 
the past three years, she has 
worked at UCSD at the Student 
Health Center educating college 
and high school students. 

Health advocates hold on-cam-
pus information sessions by 
request. They also hold several 
assemblies at local high schools, 
informing high school seniors 
about sexually transmitted dis-
eases.

The UCSD Guardian 

applauded the efforts to bring 
awareness of sexual issues. 

") think it's a good idea that 
people need to learn about: said 
Roosevelt senior Andrew 
Culberson. "College students 
should be confronted with these 
issues in a grown-up way." 

Other students spoke of the 
need for abstinence from sexual 
activity prior to marriage. Revelle 
senior Sandra Zipperer promoted 
abstinence on two grounds. 

"Abstinence is'not only the ulti-
mate protection but it also allows 
you to save the gift of sexuality for 
your lifetime partner: Zipperer 
said. 

Working concurred with 
Zipperer on the superior safety of 
abstinence. 

"Abstinence is the only 100 per-
cent form of protection: Working 
said. 

Another event planned for this 
week is the play concerning 
female sexual issues, "The Vagina

Ban to Prohibit 
Smoking Near 
Playgrounds 

The San Diego City <:ouncil, after being 
lobbied by a local anti-smoking group, 
recently passed a law banning smoking near 
playgrounds. This move is commended by 
the Guardian . 

The advertis ing and ava ilability of 
tobacco produ cts are already heavily 
restricted by federal and state authorities. 
For example, tobacco companies may not 
purchase television commercials or road-
side billboards to advertise their products, 

• and unusually high sales taxes are tacked 
onto every Califo rnia tobacco purchase. 
However, these seemingly harsh restric-
tions were not imposed without good 
cause. 

Studies have shown that young children 
were once statistically more likely to be able 
to identify now-retired cartoon character 
Joe Camel - the ad icon of Camel tobacco 
products - than Mickey Mouse. Because 
ch ildren are so impressionable, they are 
often made the prime targets of advertising 
campaigns that seek lifetime loyal con-
sumers. 

ow that fede ral and state authorities 
have acknowledged the importance of 
protecting children from advertisers' 
images of smokers and smoking, the play-
ground ban will ensure that children do 
not ironically gain exposure to smoking in 
person (and on their own tu rt) , while fed-
eral and state authorities work so hard to 
end children's exposure to it in the adver-
tising world. 

Although the Guardian believes that per-
sonal choice and individual freedom gener-
ally should be free from government intru-
sion, the playground ban ul timately earns 
our support for two reasons. 

First, it aims to protect impressionable 
and often defenseless children fro!11 being 
exposed to smoking, when they may not be 
emotionally mature enough to rationally 
reject or accept. 

Second, the playground ban is not overly 
far-reaching in its restrictions on smokers' 
rights. It is not an attempt to ban smoking 
in all public areas, nor does it restrict the 
rights of smokers to the point of persecu-
tion.

Popular Stereotypes in Society Make 
Searching fot a Niche Difficult 

Many minority students struggle to assert their real identity in a culture too 
quick to judge and label them as something that they are not 

By JACQUEUNE CHEUNG 
Staff Writer 

Have you ever felt like wringing some-
one's neck for trying to pigeonhole you 
into a category or group or for trying to 
label you with something that has deroga-
tory implications? Have you ever felt com-
pelled to apologize for being the way you 
are or because you think a certain way? [ 
have had it up to here with trying to 
defend certain aspects of my identity. 

[f someone were to ask me how [ iden-
tified myself ethnically, [ would answer 
"I'm Asian" or "I'm Chinese: I have ethnic 
and cultural pride and pride in being an 
American as well. But it seems to me that 
by that simple response, I have already put 
myself in a place where my identity is 
socially constructed. 

Some people would say that I'm a typ-
ical Asian. [ drive a Honda Accord. I eat 
pho a lot. [ like pearl iced tea. [ listen to 
rave music. [ like Sailor Moon. Most of my 
friends are Asian, although [ have friends 
of many ethnic backgrounds. On the other 
hand, [ also like musicals and alternative 
music. [ hate math and science and [ 
belong to a Greek sorority at UCSD. 

[t seems [ can't win. Just based upon 
my looks, everyone already seems to have 
an idea of what [ am or should be. My 
Asian friends often call me "whitewashed: 
They can't understand, for instance, why [ 
might want to go to a certain fraternity 
party. One of my best friends asked me 
once, "What the heck are you doing in that 
white sorority?" 

Another time, [ was in the car with a 
friend listening to Green Day's "Tune of 
Your Life" and he told me, "[ don't under-

stand this kind of music. It's for white peo-
ple." [ like my life, and [ like my friends, but 
sometimes people just make me want to 
scream. 

[ don't know who coined the term 
"whitewashed: but [ know it's something 
Asian people generally don't like to be 
called. By calling someone whitewashed it 
implies inferiority, as if that person cannot 
embrace, or refuses to embrace, certain 
characteristics of being Asian. The white-
washed are criticized for not making the 

I try hard to balance myself 
between the two extremes, 
Asian-identified Aszans and 
so-called whitewashed Asians. 
But everything I do seems to 
make people align me with 
one group or the other and the 
stereotypes that come with 
each. 
effort to better align themselves with their 
own kind. 

Other people have called me "f.o.b.: a 
derogatory tenn used to refer to someone 
who seems like they are "fresh off the 
boat." I've been accused of being racist 
because [ once attended a Chinese 
Church. 

Just beca~ [ wish to go somewhere 
where [ can identify with Chinese people 
doesn't mean ['m racist. [ remember get-
ting upset at a friend who remarked, 
"You're supposed to be good in mathlw 

when [ barely passed a calculus class. [ 
responded, "So, am [ not supposed to be 
good in English?" 

[ try hard to balance myself between 
the two extremes, Asian-identified Asians 
and so-called whitewashed Asians. But 
·everything [ do seems to make people align 
me with one group or the other and the 
stereotypes that come with each. [ run into 
a wall no matter where [ tum. 

[ have even received bad reactions 
from people who don't think [ should 
associate with anyone who isn't Asian. [ 
once walked into a pho restaurant in 
Clairemont Mesa with a white friend and 
was stared down by a group of Asian 
guys who obviously disapproved of my 

. association. So, although he was just a 
friend, [ held hands with him just to piss 
them off. 

[ recently had an argument with two 
friends who had the gall to say they 
thought all black people are lazy. [ cited the 
history of discrimination and prejudice 
experienced by African Americans in the 
past and up to the present day before 
exploding with, "You freakin' pricks! Have 
you ever actually taken the time to get to 
know or have a conversation with a black 
person? How many friends do you have 
who are black?" 

[t seems to me that the minute I do 
something that i~n't within the socially 
constructed realm of "being Asian; [ get 
slapped in the face with stereotypes and

True Love Defeats All Obstacles 
Divorce may be an easy option, but it is not the best route to take 

Speak UPI 
k Out! 

PARISA BAHARIAN 
Can love truly conquer all? [n 

light of the shocking split of 
Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise, [ 
would say it is not very probable 
that love can endure for a lifetime. 

With the news of their 
impending divorce, my hopes for 
enduring love were dashed and 

_my faith was shattered. They were 
married for 11 years and still 
appeared so much in love. They 
were the marriage "dream team" 
that, in my mind, was going to 
prove that love could endure any 
obstacle and conquer all. 

But news of their breakup 
brought a host of doubts. The 
high-profile split was the reason 
I began my quest to discover 
why. Why are more than fifty 
percent of marriages ending in 
divorce? Why isn't love endur-
ing? Why, why, why? • 

The biggest problem [ see is 
that marriage does not come 
equipped with a handbook on 
how to make it work. Instead, our 
perspective 'of marriage is deeply 
entrenched in society'S views on 

what marriage should and 
should not be. 

It is clear to me that modem 
society views divorce as an every-
day function, yet in my grandpar-
ents' generation, divorce was not 
accepted. It was deemed wrong 
and only viewed as the last resort. 
That there were fewer divorces in 
my grandparents' era doesn't 
mean that people loved each 
other more, but that they were 

Now it is accepted as 
normal for people to fall 
in and out of love ... 
The attempt to try to 
fix the marriage isn't 
considered as normal as 
racing to a divorce 
attorney to be the one 
who files first. 
constrained by society's expecta-
tions to make the effort to work 
through marital problems. 

Now it is accepted as normal 
for people to fall in and out of 
love and that divorce is just an 
expected outcome. The attempt 
to try to fix the marriage isn't 
considered as normal as racing to 

a divorce attorney to be the one 
who files first. It has become 
accepted that since people are 
bound to change, things are not 
expected to last and that mar-
riage does not necessarily need to 
last either. • 

So I pose this question: Why 
has our society's view of marriage 
changed so drastically within 
only a few decades? 

The possible answer is that 
our society has become con-
sumed with the idea of being 
happy, that there is an ultimate 
state of happiness just within our 
reach once we have that perfect 
relationship, car or job. 

Thus when the going gets 
tough, it's no big deal. The men-
tality is to bail out of marriage 
because problems and suffering 
are not something we should 
have to put up with. After all, we 
are meant to be happy and to 
seek what makes us happy, no 
matter the cost. 

I'm sorry to say it, but life is 
not one big, happy ride at a 
theme park. There are mountains 
to climb and hardships to con-
quer. 

It is not too much to ask that 
this mentality of working 
through real-life hardships be

An Expert's Guide to Safe 
and Happy Drinking 
Common sense suggestions for a wild night 
of painless and stainless fun 
By JACOB WASSERMAN 
Staff Writer 

Dear Littles and Germinates: 
Nothing ruins my night quicker 

than four shots of vodka poured in 
my lap ... especially when accom-
panied by a fast food teriyaki burg-
er, a large shake and whatever else 
you downed before coming to my 
party and puking it back up. Talk 
about faux pas. 

I firmly believe this reputedly 
dull and studious student body 
harbors intense -desires for all -
night action, but I know full well 
that many arrive at UCSD with-
out ever having tasted the heady 
brew of the college party, much 
less the head-spinning brews 
offered there. 

You can party, friends and frosh, 
without getting knocked down or 
knocked up by the more seasoned 
carousers out there. 

This is where I come in . 
Want to survive the winter 

quarter flurry of fiestas? Then 
study (and clip and save in your 
wallet) this, my guide to the ins and 
outs of nonsober partying. It's the 
next best thing to me holding your 
hand all night long. 

Select a designated driver. 

This noble soul holds the 
wheel, holds the money, holds your 
hair back while you puke. 

The "DO's· job is not just to 
drive but also to take care of 
everyone. A DO can prevent you 
from unwanted vomit stains, 
glasses of bongwater, and 
syphilitic pregnancy from unpro-
tected sex with that beer-goggle-
enhanced sweetie from Delta 
Sigma who promised he had his 
tubes tied last summer. 

Be not half assed. 
Dun't experiment with DDs who 

get to drink for an hour and then 
sober up. 

Do pay your DO's way, includ-
ing gas money, cover charge, food 
and dry cleaning. No matter how 
considerate you are, your DO will 
indubitably get the shaft , even if the 
car is an automatic. 

Dun't volunteer to be the DO 
unless you have the right tempera-
ment to do all the work and enjoy 
it. 

Don't drink alone . Th is 
applies when you are "partying" 
alone in your room, -a nd when 
yo u are going solo to a big bash, 
and especially when no one else in

contInHd ".. ...... By ANDREW JEFFERY 

Staff Writer 

The other weekend, my room-
mates and I had a rousing game of 
Monopoly, and it got me thinking 
about what incredible things we 
learned when we played the game 
as children. 

The idea of owning property 
versus owning cash, negotiating 
and trading, bonds maturing, pay-
ing rent - the list goes on. As our 
evening dedicated to our far sim-
pler lives continued, we watched 
"Sesame Street" and I marveled 
again at the lessons those puppets 
taught us. 

Unl ike children today, we ~ere 
quickly fed valuable information 
about life situations and how to 
interact and deal with people of all 
ki nds. In simple and subconscious 
ways, we formed an idea of how the 
world worked and how humans 
could work together effectively. 

As the debate rages about how 
to curb violence among children, 
especially in our schools, there 
have been many proposed causes 
and just as many proposed solu-
tions to this problem. 

Violent television shows, 
movies and video games are pop-
ular scapegoats, while tighter gun 
control laws, ratings for television 
shows and other minor forms of 
censorship have been proposed as 
Band-Aid solutions. However, it 
seems that as the search for a suit-
able fall guy and the most politi-
ca lly advantageous solution con-
ti nues, bureaucrats and activist 
groups alike are slightly off target. 

The ac tivi ties that children 
engage in today are introverted in 
nature and do not involve the 
healthy interaction among chil-

dren that is crucial to learning 
how to relate to others in a har-
monious way. 

The murders that children see 
on television and the violence in 
video games cannot be entirely 
blamed for violence in schools. 
Instead, parents need to examine 
how their children spend their 
time and what lessons they are 
learning throughout the day. 

Let us step back to when we 
were in kindergarten. What did we 
do? After an arduous day of 
school that ended around 11 a.m., 
we invited friends over to play 
games, climb trees, go to soccer 
practice, or maybe watch some 
Tv: Video games were just coming 
onto the scene when we were that 
young. Let us look at what chil-
dren today do in their spare time. 
They play video and computer 
games, use the Internet, some play 
sports, and nearly all watch TV. 

My younger brother and sister 
have never even heard of "Sesame 
Street; and my brother wakes up 
to play video games before school 
each day and throws a fit when my 
dad tries to make him tum the 
computer off to go to bed. 

The characteristic that nearly 
all of our childhood activities had 
in common was that they required 
other children. Board games 
require at least one other person 
and we learned that we sometimes 
won and sometimes lost. Dealing 
well with winning and losing with 
friends was essential, because no 
one wanted to play with a sore 
loser, or a sore winner. 

Team sports force children to ' 
interact with others whom they 
may not know and collaborate for 
a common goa l. Children learn 
teamwork, respect and sports-

manship. Even those who do not 
enjoy· sports can learn lessons 
about how to work in situations in 
which they do not necessarily feel 
comfortable. There are countless 
other examples of how we learned 
valuable life lessons as cltildren 
without even knowing it. 

Take "Sesame Street." What did 
the two-headed monster do? Each 
had half a word, and only when 
they worked together and com-
bined the two halves could they 
create a real word. We didn't realize 
it, but those goofy monsters were 
teaching us how to work together. 
Bert and Ernie showed us that 
roommates don't always get along 
but can still remain friends. 

Video games and the comput-
er are, for the most part, non inter-
active activities - you don't have 
to deal with other people. Today's 
video games are more individual 
in nature. If you lose while playing 
a video game, you can start over or 
continue. It has essentially no 
consequences, and thus children 
never learn that losing can often 
be very hard to accept and can 
involve uncomfortable situations. 

The problem-solving skills 
attained while playing video games 
are all reclusive in nature. as they 
do involve actual human situations. 
Video games teach children noth-
ing about real life, and nothing 
about other people. Staring at a 
screen - even with other children 
- is not a substitute for sitting 
around a table and actually inter-
acting with other childn-.n. 

Using the Internet is touted as 
a valuable resource for children 
yet req uires very' little problem 
solving and does not teach chil-

your group of friends is drinking, 
toking, snorting, what have you. 
I'm not going to go into the whole 
"addiction warning signs" spiel. 
Just don't be that dork. 

Mix your own everything. 
That glass, reefer, capsule or 
brown bag of fumes everyone else 
is passing around might be a 
notch or two fast safe volume for 
your brain. I everyone, or even 
just on'e really cute smiling person 
says, "It's OK, go for it. You can 
handle it," that's a sure bet that 
you can't. 

Leam your tolerance: levels 
at home. Do not explore unchart-
ed territories of substance abuse 
while on the unfamiliar ground of 
a party. It'll only end in tears and 
stains. 

A helpful biopsycholo&y tip: 
Some aspects of tolerance are 
environmentally related, so when 
you party at someone else's pad, 
try a slightly smaller bucket of 
scotch. 

Leave with them that brung 
ya. This is generally a good idea 
when your group is sober, and a 
potential matter of death and life 
when some of you arc: not It is a 
matter of death because: you might 
stupidly get on top of something. 
fall off, and die. It is a matter of life:, 
because you might stupidly get on 
top of something. not fall off, and 
make a baby. 

You do not haft to use sub-
stances to enjoy the party. 

Actually, this is a lie. Some of 
you do have to usc: substances to 
enjoy the party, and that is sick. It 
is also boring. If you cannot party 

You can party sober and 
enjoy yourself more:. I am drunk 
at parties a lot, but I am sober 
much more often. It sucks when 
you are the only person who can 
talk to the strange drunk girl who 
got left behind by her friend an.d 
pissed in the host's bed, but thiS 
has only happened to me once. 
There are three advantages to 
sober partying. 

First, someone you know will 
definitely do sQmething embar-
rassing while drunk and spend 
the rest of the year trying to for-
get. When you are sober, you get 
to do the reminding! 

Second, your odds of dying 
from alcohol or drug overdose, or 
getting beat up by someone bigger 
and meaner go way down when 
you are sober. 

Third, speaking of going 
down, it is true that !)lind-altering 
substances provide a loosening 
effect that can grease the gears of 
the awkward socia! dance that is 
the random hookup. 

But while it might be harder to 
make your move, making out with 
that other sober partygoer is 
bound to be much more reward-
ing, on account of the fact that 
you both will know what you are 
doing. 

This beats the hell out of awk-
wardly hitting on your ex-girl-
friend, which I have never done 
enough times in one night for 
anyone to prove it. 

This concludes the unsober 
partying tutorial. Go forth, get 
trashed, but try not to multiply -
unless your checkbook really needs 
balancing.

Column: 
l-Vedding vows should be 
taken seriously 
continued from ..... I 
applied to love and marriage. 

What ever happened to "for bet-
ter, for worse, for richer, for poorer, 
in sickness and in health"? Wed-
ding vows do not say "in ~ood 
times, but when the bad umes 
come, it's time to hit the road." 
They say "in good times and in 
bad." 

I think this is the part everyone 
forgets. Love and marriage ar~. not 
easy and it is not a fairy tale with a 
fairy-tale ending. In order to make 
love last, it requires work and com-
promise. 

Stereotypes: 
Social construction of race 
abaunds in society tixltry 
continued from ..... 4 
gramming that tells .me to hate, 
ludge'and stuff myself mto the near-
est and most convenient pigeonhole 

-possible. This programming also 
tries to .socially construct who I am 
and what I can achieve. 

I think it's important to point out 
that we can't assume that just 
because people are one ethnicity, 
they are automatically going to be 
prejudiced against another race. As a 
white friend recently said to me, 
"Since I came to UCSD I've felt like 
I should walk around with a sticker 
on my forehead saying, 'I do not dis-
criminate against people of color: I 
have friends of all ethnicities. Don't 
hate me because I'm white!" 

I'm not trying to save the world. 
I'm just trying to be ~yself and live 
my life without worrymg that people 
wiII constantly bag on me for who I 
am. I think other people should have 
that right as well. 

Our nation is supposed to be 
founded on the principles of equali-
ty and freedom. Yet we're not really 
equal and we're not really free to be 
who we are. 

The outlook for everlasting love 
is certainly grim. People all around 
us are divorcing. From celebrities 
to people we know, we are being 
shown that love does not last , that 
it falters and breaks down when 
faced of obstacles and hardships. 

Investing in a relationship · and 
in the promise of everlasting love 
sounds scary. It is downright risky. 
But then again, life is unpredictable 
and inherently risky, so why not 
take the risk? 

Are love and marriage worth the 
risk of hardship and pain? I say yes, 
take the risk. 

What is life without making that 
all-important connection with 
another person? All the odds are 
stacked against enduring love, but I 
am still betting on love to conquer 
all . 

I get beat on bot~ sides. I g.et crit-
icized for embracmg certam so-
called Asian characteristics, and I get 
criticized for being too white. It 
works both ways, and as a whole I 
think our society has a really jaded 
view of the social construction of 
race how people of certain ethnici-
ties are "supposed" to be. I mean,. not 
every Asian is going to like pearllce.d 
tea, and not every black person IS 
going to love rap. We s~ould stop 
trying to shove people mto molds 
that they did not create. 

But when is it going to end? 
When am I going to be able to walk 
down the street with my black friend 
without getting stared at? When can 
I stop trying to walk between ~e 
lines of being called' f.o.b. and bemg 
called whitewashed? When can I be 
myself without being judged? 

If people can learn to think 
beyond what they have been taught 
to think, then maybe they can learn 
to extend beyond the limits of their 
own ignorance. 

You can think what you want of 
me and how I live my life, but don't 
hate me because I refuse to conform 
myself to the mol~ of p~ogram~ing 
that society has tned to mdoctnnate 
me with. And in the meantime, the 
next person who calls me whi~e­
washed is going to get a chopstick 
shoved up his ass.

Dear Editor: 
This is in response to the arti-

cle covering Friday's Vanilla Ice 
concert. When I saw the head-
line, I thought the article would 
touch on the more negative 
aspects of the concert rather 
than gloss over them. 

I was there and I am female. 
The concert was not what I was 
expecting. I was standing in the 
crowd, and suddenly Vanilla Ice 
is up there asking which girl is ' 
going to flash him for a string of 
beads. Throughout the night, 
he'd keep saying "show me y?ur 
titties," and once there were girls 
up on stage, he got worse. 
Because none of them would 
take their tops off, he started say-
ing "take that shit off" and 
encouraged the men in the 
crowd to chant along. Then he 
started dissing them and call ing 
them teases, and again started in 

with the "take it off" 
comments. He finally dismissed 
the girls onstage as a bunch of 
teases, saying "they' re just up 
here teasing us, guys." 

I found his behavio r 
abso lutely di sgusting and 
indicative of a deeper misogyny. 
Women are not objects to be 
displayed, nor are we playthings 
whose actions are to be dictated 
to us by a man. Maybe if Ice 
realized this, his wife wouldn 't 
be missing a chunk of her 
hair. Remember Woodstock '99? 
The combination of a group 
inciting the men to tell women 
to take their tops off (and some 
women complying) with an 
extremely large crowd and a lot 
of alcohol ended in several 
women being raped . Look at the 
Puerto Rican Day parade m 
New York City. Those women 
had their tops ripped off by men 
who had been drinking and who 
basically had a testosterone 
overload. I'm not saying all men 
will do this, just that there is a 
subset of the male population 
that can be incited by these sorts 

of actions. 
Vanilla Ice is a performer that 

I used to have a little respect 
for. I've lost all respect for him 
now. He's no different than the 
other artists out there who try to 
be "real" by putting down 
women. If he's a real artist and a 
real man, he can show off his tal-
ent without being misogynistic. I 
think that by not covering this 
aspect of the. co~cert, . t~e

disservice not only to the true

know that such attitudes still 
exist. 

I regret paying money for that

take that back. I only regret that

purchase of. that ticket. It was 
well worth my money to hear 
Kurt, Crazy and Otterpop (the

As for asking wo men to take 
their tops off and calling them

not seem like a big deal, but it i . 
That's what we all shou ld think 
about. That behavior just perpet-

mend the people in attendance. 
None of the females took thei r

Dear Editor: 

With the election of George 
Bush as our ' new president, the 
ideological issues important to 
Bush and the Republican Party 
are coming to the forefront. As I 
read through the paper these 
days, one of the most popular 
issues is school prayer. 

I've read many arguments 
favoring school prayer on the 
basis that "witnesses are reqUired 
to swear" in the Supreme Court 
and other courts; our forefathers 
"recognized God in the very fabric 
of our nation." I've even seen

8 OPINION 

Children: 
Parents are responsible far 
raising mature kids 
contlnu'" from paC •• 
dren anything about their peers. 
They may learn facts and figures 
and even how to gather informa-
tion, but that knowledge is useless 
if they have never engaged in a dis-
cussion or an argument with some-
one their own age. 

A University of Michigan study 
concluded that compared with 
1981, children in 1997 spent less 
time outdoors, less time playing with 
other children and less time reading. 
In addition, the report stated that 
children who played games and puz-
zles at home with their parents 
scored higher on most standardized 
tests. These and other interactive 
actlvltlt'S were determined to 
increase problem-solving skills. 

Winning and losing create situa-
tions that require accommodating, 
cooperating and collaborating. 
Those chi ldren who have can han-
dle such situations and will be the 
ones who succeed in school both in 
the classroom and on the play-
ground. 1110se who face defeat in 
schoolwork and other activities at 
school for the first time are ill-
equipped to deal with these situa-
tions. These children are more likely 
to resort to violence, as they have no 

other means of solving problems to 
come to a nonviolent solution. 

Psychological research has 
shown that children who grow up 
learning how to deal with conflict 
have an easier time handling major 
loss (such as the loss of a parent or 
loved one) than children who grow 
up introverted, with relatively little 
experience dealing with discord in 
their lives. 

Parents are the key to raising 
nonviolent children who are 
equipped to handle life situations. It 
is ultimately up to parents them-
selves to monitor their own children. 
Frightening as it may be. many of us 
are going to be parents in the not-
too-distant future. It will be up to us 
to make sure our children learn to 
interact with other children in a 
peaceful and productive manner. 

Children are not going to 
change overnight with a new pro-
gram or law. Change is gradual. In 
this case. change is going to neces-
sitate a new breed of parents who 
are active in their children's lives, 
teaching them right and wrong and 
encouraging them to participate in 
activities that will assist them in 
learning about people. 

As the progress of entertainment 
technology channels children to 
introvened activities, it will be our 
job as parents to refocus their atten-
tion outward to other children, so 
violence moves far down on the list 
of possible ways to deal with prob- .

contInu ... from .... 7 
instances where the writer attacks 
those of beliefs contradictory to 
his by stating, MNever allow mis-
guided people to remove the 
name of God for our public 
schools." 

In a nation known for its diver-
sity, founded by those persecuted 
for their beliefs, I think it's archaic 
to claim that anybody of different 
beliefs is misguided. We live in a 
world consisting of many hun-
dreds, if not thousands of religions, 
not all of which believe in God, at 
least in the traditional sense. 

Take, for example, Hinduism, 
Buddhism and atheism, beliefs rec-
ognized worldwide. There are many 
faiths, although by default, not all 
can be right. Let's assume, momen-
tarily, that atheists are right; there is 
no God. Why should they be forced 
to go against their beliefs? Would-
n't this go against everything that 
our forefathers had intended as 
well? "Congress shall make no law 
respecting an establishment of reli-
gion, or prohibiting the free exer-
cise thereof." 

No one is removing the name 
of God from our schools. Every-
body is entitled to pray. I pray 

every day in school, before a test, 
before a big athletic competition, 
but nobody knows, because ( do 
so quietly. Let's not forget a 
man's relation with God is 
between God and that man. To 
address the issue of the court 
using the name of God: Web-
ster's dictionary defines God as 
"the supreme or ultimate reality: 
The great majority of people 
believe in a God by that defini-
tion; something that exists that is 
greater than us, whether it be a 
being, a collective hope or an 
inner sflirit. So, therefore, the 
court is more than justified for 
using God during swear-ins. 

As for our forefathers, there is 
no do·ubt in my mind that they 
were great men who created the 
most prosperous nation in the 
world today. But they were not 
perfect. Let's not forget these were 
the same men who also upheld 
and encouraged slavery for many 
decades. These are the same men 
who created the Electoral College, 
a system that allowed Bush to 
defeat AI Gore for the presidency 
of the United States with fewer 
votes. Those who support their 
beliefs using Biblical references 
must realize that, although they 
represent the majority in the 
United States, they do not repre-
sent 100 percent of the popula-
tion. Therefore, their biblical ref-
erences and comments that "the 

Thursday, February 15,2001 

Bible teaches us to acknowledge 
God" will mean very little to those 
of faiths other than Christianity, 
and even less to those of no faith 
at all. 

The reality is the Bible does 
not teach MUS" but rather teaches 
"Christians" to acknowledge 
God. Let's not forget that the 
Bible is the holy book of Chris-
tians, not of all religions. We 
must always recognize that this 
country is not united by its reli-
gion. We are not even united by 
any of our similarities; the only 
similarity that we are united by is 
our diversity. We are united by 
our uniqueness. We are a nation 
built upon ~ foundation of 
encouraging and honoring indi-
viduality. We promote the pro-
tection of our individual rights 
above all else. 

Allowing an institution such 
as school prayer in the public 
school system to take effect 
would be a direct violation of our 
First Amendment rights. 

It would be -an attempt to 
force Americans to unite under 
one religion and force many to 
sacrifice all they believe in. Then 
we would no longer be the great 
nation America, but simply a 
reincarnation of tyrannous Eng-
land.

Breaking With the Pentagon, Bush 
Calls For New Weapons Systems 

NORFOLK, Va. - President 
Bush said Thursday that he 
planned to break with Pentagon 
orthodoxy and create "a new 
architecture for the defense of 
America and our al- lies; invest-
ing in new technologies and 
weapons systems rather than 
making "marginal improvements" 
for systems in which America's 
arms industry has invested bil-
lions of dollars. 

In his second speech on nation-
al security this week, Bush 
appeared to take sides in a long-
brewing debate in the military 
estabHshment over whether to 
Invest in entirely new technologies 

'lind weapons systems, even if that 
means neglecting older and outdat-
ed systems for years until the next 
generation of arms is available. 

"We do not know yet the exact 
shape of our future military; Bush 
said, "but we know the direction 
we must begin to travel. On land, 
our heavy forces will be lighter, our 
light forces will be more lethal. All 
will be easier to deploy and to sus-
tain . ..In the air, we will be able to 
strike across the world with pin-

point accuracy, using both aircraft 
and unmanned systems." 

Bush stressed Tuesday that he 
was unwilling to spend much on 
his new plans until Defense 
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who 
sat beside him during his speech to 
Navy personnel here, completed a 
comprehensive review of American 

Bush offered no specifics

saying he had given

mandate to challenge the 
staus quo." 
strategy and force structures. 

Bush offered no specifics 
Tuesday, apart from saying he had 
given Rumsfeld "a broad mandate 
to challenge the status quo." In 
next year's budget, the president 
said, he would provide only 
$2.6billion in addi tional funds for 
research and development. That 
represents an increase of only 
about 6 percent over existing lev-

els - an increase Republicans in 
Congress said was far too low. 

Bush acknowledged that the 
amount he was proposing was 
hardly the kind of money needed 
to rethink an entire arsenal. but 
said "before we make our full 
investment, we must know our 
exact priorities." 

"We will modernize some exist-
ing weapons and equipment, a task 
we have neglected for too long; 
Bush said here at the headquarters 
of NATO's Atlantic command. 
"But we will do this judiciously 
and selectively. Our goal is to move 
beyond marginal improvements to 
harness new technologies that will 
support a new strategy." 

That strategy is bound to set 
off a scramble within American 
industry - especially among a 
new group of software companies 
and others who have not tradi-
tionally served as defense contrac-
tors - for tens or hundreds of 
billions of dollars in new 
Pentagon contracts.

Leading Drug Prevention Program shifts 
its strategy in response to criticism 

LOS ANGELES - The lead-
ers of the nation's most widely 
used program to discourage drug 
use among schoolchildren have 
acknowledged that their strategy 
has not had sufficient impact and 
say they are developing a new 
approach to spreading their mes-
sage. 

The DARE program, whose 
acronym stands for Drug Abuse 
Resistance Education. )las grown 
rapidly since its founding 18 years 
ago. It is now taught in 75 percent 
of school districts nationwide and 
in 54 other countries. 

But with criticism of the pro-
gram 's effectiveness increasing, 
DARE officials and independent 
researchers have quietly worked 
for two years to develop a new 
curriculum and plan to introduce 
it in Washington on Thursday. 

DARE has long dismissed crit-
icism of its approach as flawed or 
the work of groups that favor 
decriminalization of drug use. But 
the body of research had grown to 
the .point that the organization 
could no longer ignore it - in the 
the past two months alone, both 
the U.S. Surgeon General and the 
National Academy of Sciences 
have issued reports saying that 

DARE's approach is ineffective, 
and several cities, most recently 
Salt Lake City, have discontinued 
the program. 

"There's quite a bit we can do 
to make it better and we realize 
that," said Glenn Levant, presi-
dent and founding director of 
DARE America.t based in Los 
Angeles. 

The new DARE program is 
being developed at the University 
of Akron in Ohio by Zili Sloboda, 
who· as director of the National 
Institute on Drug Abuse wrotl " 

. list of principles to guide rUb 
prevention programs. It is being 
underwritten by a $13.7 million 
grant from the Robert Wood 
johnson Foundation, a philan-
thropy devoted to health care.n 

One six-year study conducted 
by the University of Illinois found 
that the program's effects were 
diminished by senior year of high 
school; in fact , it detected some 
increased use of drugs by subur-
ban high schoolers who had taken 
the program. 

A 10-year study conducted by 
the University of Kentuck¥ found 
that the DARE program had no 
effect on students by the time they 
were 20 years old . 

The new program will work to 
change the perception of social 
norms among students. The idea 
is based on the belief that tradi-
tional prevention programs may 
lead students to overestimate how 
many of their peers are using 
drugs. Because teenagers are so 
open to peer influence, they may 
begin using drugs to aspire to that 
Mnorm." 

The new strategy will also shift 
the program's focus from fifth 
grade to seventh grade, and adds a 
1",,< er program in ninth rade, 
" ",c ,\ Jcnts in the higher 
grades are more likely to experi-
ment with drugs. Students do 
more role playing, with an empha- . 
sis on how to make decisions, and 
talk about the effect of media and 
advertising. 

"We have a whole new genera-
tion of children who are much 
more interactive than kids were 
before: Levant said . "They're 
more savvy than they were before, 
they're maturing much earlier 
than they used to. We need some-
thing that the kids will consider 
hip and cool and effective."

so evident in a number of economic 
indicators toward the end of last

"At the moment, we are not," 
Greenspan said when he was asked 
if the economy was in recession. 

event that the nation was entering a 
prolonged recession. 

But he cast doubt on the Bush 
administration's contention that 
passing a tax cut quickly would 
help the economy recover from a 
short, sharp downturn . 

"It is most unlikely that if we go 
through a regular recession that 
any tax cut can be enacted suffi-
ciently quickly to alter the proba-
bility of whether we will, indeed, 
find ourselves in a recession ," 
Greenspan said. 

In his semi-annual report on 
monetary policy, Greenspan did 

not directly address 
whether the central 
bank is likely to con-
tinue with its cam-
paign of aggressive 
interest-rate reduc-

cy-making meeting 
on March 20. The

Greenspan said 
the long-term out-

bright because the

- were toO light, given the horren-
dous nature of the crime. 

Retired Gen. jaime Humbeno 
Uscategui and Col. Hernan Orozco 
were convicted for having allowed 
gunmen from the United Self-
Defense Forces of Colombia to ellter 
the southern village of Mapiripan in 
july 1997 in search of suspected 
rebel sympathizers. Over six days. 
the men decapitated villagers and 
burned bodies, as calls for help from 
local officials went unheeded. 
Authorities have said that at least 30 
people died, though the exact num-
ber remains unknown. 

Human rights groups say that 
Colombia's paramilitaries have his-
torically had ties to the military, 
receiving logistical and, in some . 
cases, tactical support in their 
attacks on villages. In the 
Mapiripan case, investigators 
believe that the military not only 

remain ' robust. the 
Fed chairman said, it could wipe out 
some of the long-term problems fac-
ing the country, even the projected 
insolvency of the Social Security sys-
tem in coming decades. 

"What we are learning with 
these changing productivity num-
bers is that a major alteration in 
how we view our future, how we 
view Social Security, how we view 
our fiscal affairs" will be necessary, 
Greenspan said.

ignored warnings and cries for help 
from villagers, but may have also 
allowed paramilitaries to stop at a 
nearby army base en route to the 
village. 

A military tribunal , in finding 
Uscategui guilty of "omission," said 
he "didn 't act, though he could 
have and should have." 

Uscategui, who was relieved of 
his duties last year, was comman-
der of the 7th Brigade in the south-
ern province of Meta when th~ 
massacre took place. The tribunal 
said that Orozco. who commanded 
a local battalion, helped his superi -
or officer cover up reports by a 
judge in Mapiripan of the continu-
ing killings. 

Speaking to reporters, 
Uscategui denied his involvement, 
and said he would appeal the con-
viction. "I've been dishonored on 
the national and international 
level: he said. "I've been unjustly 
held prisoner for more than a year, 
and I know that the evidence is in 
my favor."

Germany Says Russia to Negotiate on U.S. Missile Defense Plan 
MOSCOW President 

Vladimir Putin and Germany's for-
eign minister, joschka Fischer, dis-
cussed the United States' pro-
posed national missile defense at a 
Kremlin meeting Tuesday, ending 
two days of talks that Fischer said 
point to new Russian flexibility on 
the notion of a shield against rogue 
missiles. 

Both Fischer and Russian offi-
cials denied that Germany was act-
ing as an intermediary between 
Moscow and the new Bush admin-
istration, which has made clear its 
plan to develop the shield in the 
f'lce of European qualms and fierce 

Russian opposition. 
But Fischer wi ll be in 

Washington next week. And after 
talks with many of the Kremlin's 
top foreign-policy leaders and the 
Communist leader of Parliament, 
covering the missile-defense plan 
in depth, it was clear that he would 
be able to give the White House a 
detailed view of Russia's objec-
tions. 

Russia's foreign minister, Igor 
Ivanov, who met with Fischer on 
Monday, will hold his first meeting 
with U.S. Secretary of State Colin 
Powell in Cairo, Egypt, on Feb. 24, 
the Kremlin said Thesday. ~e mis-

sile defense proposal is expected to 
be the centerpiece of those talks. 

Ivanov said on Monday that 

The missile defense 
proposal is expected to be 
the centerpiece of those 
talks. 
Russia "will act at negotiations on 
questions pertaining to strategic 
offensive weapons and missile 
defense in a constructive way." He 
added, "We are interested in 

expanding international coopera-
tion in countering new threats and 
challenges." 

Fischer went a bit further. "In 
the end, ( think Russia will accept 
negotiations· on the missile shield, 
he told reporters. . 

The United States insists that a 
limited missile defense is needed 
only to counter the growing threat 
of a surprise strike, with one or a 
handful of nuclear-tipped missiles, 
by a rogue state like North Korea 
or Iran. 

Bush's defense secretary, 
Donald Rumsfeld, has said that 
Washington will not move on its 

own without conducting extensive 
negotiations with both Europe and 
Russia. 

The United States could build a 
defense system only by abandoning 
the 1972 Antiballistic Missile 
Treaty, which prohibits mounting 
anything but the most basic 
antimissile defense. Only last week, 
the Russian defense minister, Igor 
Sergeyev, pledged to react to any 
U.S. missile shield by developing 
new countermeasures that would 
render it ineffective.

that we'd have such a small chance that we'd 
live in the apartments," said Muir freshman 
Zac Hays. 

Warren Resident Dean Claire Palmer 
said the number of continuing students 
who will be able to get on-campus housing 
next year is still changing . 

The ultimate goal of the self-supporting 
Housing and Dining Services is to return to 
the two-year guarantee as soon as possible. 
This year's freshman class and next year's 
incoming freshman do not have a two-year 
guarantee, and the following year may not 
either. 

This is partially due to the construction 
of the new Eleanor Roosevelt College 
housing on North Campus. When com-
pleted, the structures will hold 1,240 addi-
tional beds wi~h 440 in residence halls and 
800 in apartments. The project was origi-
nally intended to be completed for fall 
2002, but it will not be done until fall 2003. 
Cunningham attributed this to the good 
economy and the demand for construc-
tion. 

The housing crunch is being dealt with 
in three ways, Cunningham said. The con-
struction of the new Eleanor Roosevelt 
College is one part, and more potential 
building is being considered. This may be 
made possible with a faster construction 
process. 

Housing rm,1 Di ning Services is also 
lookll g 111[0 ott- cam pus ·acquisitions. 
UCSD currently owns La Jolla Del Sol, an 
apartment complex off Regents Road . 
Housing and Dining Services bought it in 
1987. The complex has 381 units, 126 of 
which are undergraduates. The rest of the 

. building is ocaupied by faculty, staff, gradu-
ate students and medical students. 

In addition to the loss of the two-year 
guar~ntee, tralllsfer students will not receive 
housmg next year. 

Also, Cunriingham said that the college 
Residential Life programs decided to abolish 
the all-campus housing program so that 
there could be equality among the colleges 
in numbers of spaces available. 

According to Danylyshyn-Adams, Tioga 
and Tenaya halls will all be freshmen next 
year, whereas thiS year they house about 40 
continuing students. Fifty-two beds in 

• Tuolomne Apartments will also be allotted 
I for freshmen . Sixty-two spaces for Muir stu-
I dents will be available on the Warren cam-
I pus. These spaces will be clustered so that 
I students can live in an environment with 
I other Muir students. 

Revelle sophomores will be housed in 
the Matthews Apartments. There will be 
spaces for about 250 students there. Argo 
Hall currently holds many sophomores, but 
next year there will be no continuing stu-
dents in the residence halls. There will be 
spaces for Revelle students in Pepper 
Canyon and Warren apartments as well. 

Warren sophomores will be housed in 
Douglass and Goldberg Halls, as they have 
been in the past. 

"The other colleges don't have enough 
apartments: Palmer said. "It's not a good 
situation." 

Students are apprehensive about prob-
lems arising from not being able to live on 
campus. 

"We either have to share singles with 
three people or we have to live off-campus, 
and that would force people to get cars," 
said Roosevelt student Katie Dalton. 
"Parking is already bad as it is. Some people 
can't afford cars and living off-campus 
because La Jolla is really expensive." 

Room selection day will occur April 6. It 
will be followed by an off-campus housing 
fair in the Price Center. Off-campus housing 
facilities will come to campus to allow stu-
dents to investigate options and prices if 
they do not receive on-campus housing. 

"Groups have priority over singles and 
doubles in room selection," Cunningham 
said. 

He advised that one thing students can 
do to increase their chances of receiving on-
campus housing is to form groups and 
apply for housing in those groups. Most on-
campus apartments house four people, 
though some Muir apartments hold five. 

Waiting lists will also be fonned through 
all the colleges' Residential Life Offices for 
students who do not receive housing in the 
initial raffle and still want it. 

"Don't be discouraged from going 
through room selection," Cunningham said. 
"It's worth it to go through it and see when 
you end up." 

All the colleges have been holding off-
campus housing informative sessions, and 
they will continue to do so through the 
remainder of the year. Warren college is 
planning socials for students to meet and 
interact with potential off-campus room-
mates. 

"Take a deep breath and step back and 
reassess the situation," Danylyshyn-Adams 
said. "It's workable. Lots of people do it 
already." 

On-campus students will be receiving 
brochures in their mailboxes in the next 
week. These will include information about 
on-campus room selection. 

"My heart goes out to the students that 
will be going off-campuj," Palmer said. "I 
know some will be ready to go off-campus 
and others wish they had another year."

Jennifer Lopez 
"J.Lo" 

Epic Records 
c-

Let's be honest: (f Jennifer Lopez 
recorded with only a hannonica, put 
her picture on the cover and called it 
the best record she has ever made, 
chanC'es are it would be successful. 
So is the case with uJ.Lo." It is not 

- very promising, but it will, in fact, be 
a hit-record. 

This actress-turned-singer 
released her first album in 1999, 
which _ was a success. Lopez's 
sophomore album, uJ.Lo," confi-
dently hit the pop chart in late Jan-
uary. It has since seen its first single 
hit No. 1 on the Billboard charts. 

But is it good? Well, let's just 
say it could be better. 

(n mixing teen pop and Latin 
beats with gheno flair, the majority 
of this album is destined to be heard 
on dance floors or will at least show 
up on the next "What's Hot NOW" 
compilation CD in about three 
months. 

"Love Don 't Cost A Thing" is 

Astxyc1 
premature 
reincarnation. 

• -_ ..... 

the first pop hit off th is album, with 
lyrics such as, ulf ( wanna floss, ( got 
my own ." ( think this one speaks 
for itself. . 

LopC"l goes back to her Puerto 
Rican roots with "Si Ya Se Acabo." 
Although this isn't the only track 
LopC'"l has done in Spanish, the song 
is the soulful highlight of the album. 

( like Lopez - ( really do. The 
bottom line, though, is we have been 
around the pop-princess block 
before, and it is not getting any bet-
ter.

Goldfrapp 
"Felt Mountain" 

Muse 
B 
.. 

.. 

The last time you heard Alison 
Goldfrapp's voice was on Thcky's 
album "Maxinquaye," which was 
released back in 1995. She has also 
worked with Orbital. She is strange-
ly seductive and very charismatic. 

"Felt Mountain" is one of the 
most amazing debut albums ( have 

YIIWW.do",,"toearthmovie.com 

STARTS FRIDAY .=~ .. ~ 

The UCSD Guardian 

heard in ages. Composer, vocalist, 
whistler and keyboardist Goldfrapp 
collaborated with composer Will 
Gregory and created a sound that 
combines the beauty of the past, the 
present and beyond. This is avant-
garde pop that is easy to listen to. 

Goldfrapp takes familiar sounds 
from movie soundtracks and '60s 
French pop, combin ing them with 
haunting James Bond-esque vocals 
and alluring electronic sounds. 

Take this album with you on an 
alpine trip or perhaps on a secret 
spy mission in Prague. This album 
evokes the feeling of being a daring 
and romantic spy saving the world 
from imminent destruction. 

With "Felt Mountain" as the 
soundtrack to my (-want-to-be-
just-like-James-Bond fantasies, ( 
can zoom around the freeways of 
San Diego pretending that ( am 
eluding the Commies in East Ger-
many. 

With lyrics like U ( forget who ( 
am, ( forget, fascist baby," there is 
no way you can resist Goldfrapp's 
charm. She can even make songs 
about paper bags sound sexy. 

"Felt Mountain" was recorded 
in a very large bedroom, and its 
lush rhythms and jazzy sound-
sea pes bring you to a point of 
warmth and the strange distance of 
a black and white film . This album 
is perfect for rainy days. 

(f that isn 't enough, countless 
magazine surveys of famous rock 
musicians' favorite albums indicate 
that Ed O'Brien of Radiohead and 
the illustrious Moby have given 
their praise to Goldfrapp. 

This beautiful release can bor-
der on cheesy, but this will be one 
of the best debut albums to make 
its way into your CD collection.

Stoner: 
This year's all-star 
game about desire 
ContInued from ..... 20 

But this year was different. To 
my astonishment, the players dust-
ed off their defensive skills and 
showed that there actually is an 
aspect to basketball other than 
offense. The West played hard and 
used its size to get in the face of the 
East shooters and began the game 
by holding the East scoreless for 
the first few minutes to take an 11-
o lead. 

It wasn't until Tracy McGrady's 
swat of Kobe Bryant that I really 
became aware of the defense being 
played. I'm sure that's about the 
time Kobe noticed it, too. Then, 
when Tim Duncan returned the 
favor by blocking McGrady, I final-
ly put down my congealed burrito

boost their record to 5-1 in 
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa-
tion play, and 9-2 overall. UCSD 

and pushed aside the bag of Dori-
tos in order to give my full atten-
tion to the game. 

What did I see? I saw players 
running the floor, big men pound-
ing it inside, people playing the 
kind of transition defense that 
some.times doesn't exist in the 
regular season, unselfish passing 
so rampant that I almost spit out 
my warm root beer when I heard 
that Bryant was the game's assist 
leader and athletes were actua lly 
working hard enough to break a 
sweat. 

The result was a game I was 
compelled to watch. Allen Iverson 
used every inch of his 5- foot-l0-
inch frame to intercept a pass, 
Bryant tried to break apart the 
East's defense and Jason Kidd 
threw a half-court bomb as time 
expired in the first half. This was 10 
times better than the free-wheeling 
games of the past. 

Sure, there was still room for 

was simply overmatched as the 
sixth-ranked Warriors had an 
astounding .471 hitting percent-
age with just nine hitting errors. 

UCSD saw another stellar per-
formance from last season's team 
MVP, senior Donald Chen . He 
was a leader on the floor for the 
blue and gold, knocking down a 
team-high 11 kills and notching 
three digs. Griffin Cogorno was 
also a force for the Tritons, swing-
ing for 8 kills and picking up three 
digs. Jordan Hove was once again

the acrobatic plays that tastefully 
tittilate the fans, like 360-degree 
Vince Carter dunks, incredible 
Iverson s~ots and Bryant's amazing 
athleticism. But the great thing was 
the whole game wasn't all about 
circus plays, it was about winning 
and proving one team was better 
than the other. 

It was about the East team 
refusing to fold under a 19-point 
deficit after three quarters and hav-
ing enough pride in its game to 
come back to win. 

It was about Stephan Marbury 
and Bryant going back and forth, 
trading baskets in the last few min-
utes of the game. 

It was a game about pride, heart 
and determination. It was the type 
of basketball game I'd rather see 
any day than a game focused on 
540-degree, one-handed windmill 
ollie jams with a twist. 

After all, that 's what the slam 
dunk contest should be.

up 29 ass ists o n the night to com-
plement his .333 hitting percent-
age. 

This season thus far has been a 
learning experience for th e UCSD 
men's volleyball team. 

Competition in the MOllntain 
Pacific Sports Federation , in 
which they participate, is partiClI-
larly fierce, and the Tritons have 
been coming up against the best 
teams in the nation , as their 0-7 
league (1-8 overall) record 
reflects. 

The team has competed com-
mendably to this point in the sea-
son and looks to make even more 
progress at this highest level of 
competitive play in the coming 
weeks. 

Look out for the Tritons th is 
weekend, when they will play host

loved to get another swing on the 17'h lee last Sunday 
afternoon. 

Well, if they had been playing in the 1M Golf Tour Winter Scramble, instead of another one of

ISAAC PEARLMAN 

L as t Sunday, something amazing happened: An NBA all-star game was 
played in Washington. • 

While the average weekend 
warrior may be saying, "Well , duh, 
there's " Iways an all-star game 
around th is time of the year," let 
me clarify: There was an all-star 
game played on Sunday, instead of 
the usual slopfest that the NBA 
likes to call "a showcase of the best 
in the game: 

I have watched the BA mid-
season festivities for years, but I 
have not seen anything close to 
what I would call a real gam!:!. Pre-
vious all-star "games" have fea-
tured the best in the game ignoring 
their amazing natural abi lities and 
attempting half-court all ey-oop 
lobs, horrible off-bala nce shots and 
a general "me first " ball-hogging 
mentality that wouldn 't last five 
seconds on a high school basket-
ball court. Even the players ' 
defense seemed to have been left 
behind in their home cities.

Water Polo Begins a New Year 
The women's team endures an up-and-down weekend 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Associate Sports Editor 

Last weekend the UCSD 
women's water polo season began 
with a bang as it hosted the 
UCSD Arena NoGrip Women's 
Water Polo Invita tional at 
Canyonview pool Saturday and 
Sunday. 

UCSD had a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. 
Hyde weekend, losing its first two 
games on Saturday, then return-
ing the next day to post two victo-
ries to even up its record to 2-2 . 

o.n Saturday the Tritons lost a 
tough first game to UC Santa Bar-
bara, losing in overtime, 7-6. 
UCSB took an early lead in the 
firs t quarter, outscoring UCSD 
'three goals to one. The lritons 
bounced back in the second quar-
ter, scoring two goals to tie with 
the Gauchos with stellar defense, 
rendering them unable to score. 
The two teams remained dead-
locked from there, both scoring a 
goal in the third and fourth quar-
ters to come to a 5-5 tie at the end 
of regulation . It wasn 't meant to 
be, however, as UCSB notched 
two goals in the overtime period 
to UCSD's one, giving the Gau-
chos the victory. Gaucho Mary 
Blumberg scorched the Tritons' 
all-game, finishing with five goals 
in the match . For UCSD, junior 
Courtney Hemmerly and sopho-
more Samara Silverman each 
scored two goals. In their second 
game of the afternoon, the Tritons 
ran up against eventual champion 
USc. It was all USC from the 
beginning, as the Trojans scored 
five goals in the first quarter while 
holding UCSD scoreless. The Tri-
tons did manage to bounce back

Men's Volleyball Struggles 
Against University of Hawaii 
UCSD loses in straight sets at RIMAC arena Tuesday night 
By SCOTT BURROUGHS 
Associate Sports Editor 

The men's volleyball team ran into some 
tropical trouble Thesday night against the Uni-
versity of Hawaii , dropping a heated match 
against the island dwellers in straight sets. 
Hawaii, playing without All-American starter 
Costas Theocharidis, still looked dominant on 
the hardwood, taking the three sets by scores of 
30-14,30-17 and 30-24. 

The night's action went down at UCSD's 
RIMAC Arena, and was witnessed by a crowd of 
245 hardy fans. 

The Warriors were helped by the powerful 
play of Torry Tukuafu and Brenton Davis, who 
had ten kills apiece on the night. Dejan Miladi-
novic, a 6-7 middle blocker from Kraljevo, Ser-
bia, also had 10 kills to go with an incredible 
.667 hitting percentage and a game-high nine 
blocks for the Warriors. Also stepping in to 
contribute in a big way for U of H was Tony 
Ching. Playing in the place of Theocharidis, 
who was battling the flu, Ching came out 
strong and delivered a game- and career-high 
13 kills in the victory, including six in game 
one, Teammate and outsiae hitter Eyal Zimet 
had five aces in that first set and ended up with 
a career-high seven uncontested serves. Kimo 
Tuyay recorded 21 assists for the night while 
fellow setter had 18. 

The third game was the closest for the Tri-
tons, as they battled back hard to knot the
