Outreach referendum to 
go before student vote 

Plan calls for hospital closure 
By MADEUNE PHIWPS 

Staff Writer 

Members of the A.S. Council 
have approved the addition of a ref-
erendum to the April ballot, asking 
srudems to vote on a $3 increase in 
quarterly rudent activity fees. The 
money would go to fund srudent-
initiated outreach programs and 
first be assessed in faU 2005. 

Initially, the Srudent-.Initiated 
Outreach and Recruitment 
Commission began collecting the 
3,000 signatures necessary for sru-
dents to add a referendum to the 
ballot. Unsure if the commission 
could meet the Feb. 28 deadline, it 
asked the A.S. Council to step in to 
add the item without the petition. 

In order for it to pass, the mea-
sure will need approval from more 
than 50 percent of voters, and at 
least 20 percent of the srudent body 
must participate in the poll. 

"Outreach, more specifically 
srudent-initiated outreach, is at 
the bottom of the list of concerns 
for the state," A.S. PresidentJenn 
Pae said. "In order to have stable 
funding, it is imperative that this 
referendum passes and SIORC 
will continue for fu rure years." 

Although the commIssIon 
received $41,000 from the A.S. 
Council this year, the state budget 
cuts have greatly affected SIORC 
funding, according to Marina 
Martos, an A.S. external affairs 
legislative lobbyist liaison and a 
proponent of the referendum. 

Three years ago, the state leg-
islarure awarded $ 1 million to 
fund srudent outreach programs 
on aLI UC campuses, $120,000 of 
which went to UCSD. However, 
the state has gradually cut funding 
and SIORC is running out of 
money, according to A.S. Vice 
President External Rigo Marquez. 

"We are now existing on 
rollover money from the first few 
years, but we will run out in two 
years," Marto said. "If we're not 
proactive in securing money from 
the srudents, we will run out. 
Now is the time to act." 

UCSD is not the first UC cam-
pus to attempt to implement sru-
dent funding for srudent outreach. 
UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC Santa 
Cruz and UC Riverside aLI con-
tribute portions of their activity fees 
to similar programs. The largest of

All 386 bed at UCSD's 
Hillcrest Hospital - which treats a 
major share of the county's poor -
would move and the facility would 
be hut down under a new expan-
sion plan for UCSD Healthcare 
announced by university officials. 

The long-range strategy, mov-
ing the Hillcrest beds to the uni-
versity's Thornton Hospital, has 
been met ith criticism. 

Detail«W in the report, "A New 
Vi ion for H ea lthcare," and 
approved by the UC Board of 
Regents, the plans were fi rst pub-
licly disseminated in respon e to a 
San Diego Union-Tribune public 
records request. 

"The vision over the next 15 to 
20 years is to consolidate both our 
hospitals into one hospital," aid 
UCSD Health Sciences Director of 
Communications Leslie Franz. 
"We want to expand our care to 
outpatient and emergency services. 
It wi ll be better for our patients if 
we focus our hospital's resources 
into one facility."

from its current 119 beds to 500 
beds under the plan, according to

OAP to restore study in Israel 
By MTRICK ALLEN 

Senior Staff Writer 

Srudents wanting to srudy in 
Israel may soon get their wish for 
the fi rst time since 2002. 

In April of 2002, the University 
.of California suspended its srudy 
abroad programs in Israel due to a 
travel warning issued by the U.S. 
State Department. T hough the 
warning is still in place, UCSD 
Opporrunities Abroad Program 
Coordinator Bill Clabby said that 
he is drafting a waiver that would 
allow rudents to travel to Israel. 

"We wi ll probably have a par-
ent and a srudent waiver," Clabby 
said. "Hopefully, it will be ready in 
spring quarter. This will most 
likely allow srudents to start going 
in the fa iL" 

Though OAP is planning to 
allow srudents to travel to Israel, 
there are no plans for the 
University of Californja to rein-
state the systemwide Education 
Abroad Program for the region, 
according to Bruce Hanna, direc-
tor of EAP strategic marketing 
and communications. 

"Within EAP, there is a very 
clear test for the program," Hanna 
said. "If there is a Department of 
State travel warning, there is no 
program. If the warning is 
removed, we will resume the pro-
gram within a reasonable and 
appropriate time frame ." 

EAP allows srudents to srudy at 
foreign universities and earn UC 
credits, while OAP requires the 
srudent to directly enroll in a for-

eign university and transfer the 
credits to UCSD after completion. 

Clabby said that while the OAP 
program was originally canceled 
due to security fears, the interests of 
the srudents and the university bal-
anced out the risks. 

"Safety is important to us," 
Clabby said. "EAP was in daily con-
sultation with the U.S. Embassy [in 
Tel Aviv] before the suspension of 
the program and OAP didn't want 
to be a back door into an unsafe sit-
uation. But srudents want to srudy 
in Israel, and we should bring them 
into the fold while protecting them 
and the university." 

Some srudents believe that the 
universitywide EAP in Israel should 
be reinstated. Earlier this month, 
the A.S. Council passed a resolution 
supporting the reinstatement after 
srudents from the San Diego Israel 

Alliance appealed to members with 
concerns, according to John Muir 
CollegeJunior Senator Neil Spears. 

"[Alliance President] Diane 
Meskin spoke to me about the need 
for Israel srudy abroad," sa id 
Spears, who drafted the resolution. 
"It is rea lly a triumph of students 
coming to Associated Students 
with a problem, and the Associated 
Srudents is helping to solve it." 

T he resolution called on the 
University of California to · rein -
state the program no later than fall 
2005. Among the reasons cited 
was the "decrease in violence and 
motions toward peace and safety 
by both Israelis and Palestinians." 

Acts of terrori m have 
decreased drastically throughout 
2004, according to Justin Levi ,

"In the furure, we want to pro-

Franz said. "We wi ll be able to treat

Although the plan will be imple-
mented over 20 years, it has drawn 
criticism from other members of the 
health care community, especially 

UCSD competitor Scripps llealth . 
"It causes deep concerns, 

because UCSD bought the hospital 
from the county under the guise 
that it would provide medical care 
for the poor and underservecl, " 
Scripps H ea lth Director of Public

Marshall freshman dies 
in rollover car accident 

By VLADIMIR KOCiAN 
News Editor 

Thurgood Marshall College 
freshman Sheila Lau wa killed and 
eight other srudents sustained 
minor injuries in a rollover car 
crash at the start of President's Day 
weekend. 

The accident occurred Feb. 19 
at approximately 1 a.m. as the nine 
srudents were rerurning westbound 
on Highway 52 from purchasing 
milk tea at Tapioca Express in San 
Diego. The 1999 Ford Explorer 
sports uti lity vehicle driven by John 
Muir College freshman Mimi Tran 
swerved suddenly, causing the car 
to flip , according to Muir freshman 
Derek guyen, who was sitting in 
the middle row of seats directly 
behind the driver and ustained 
minor injuries. 

"It just happened too suddenly," 
said Nguyen, explaining that it wa 

not clear what caused Tran to lose 
control. 

As she moved into the left lane, 
Tran aid the wheels of the vehicle, 
which belonged to a friend , began 
to shake and banked to the right. 
When she tried to compensate, the 
Explorer swerved sharply to the left 
and eventually flipped. 

"I think it was a combination o f 
the speed and having so many peo-
ple in the ca r," Tran said . 

Traffic on the road was light, 
according to Nguyen, and alcohol 
was not a factor in the accident. 

Lau was seated in the front pas-
sc:nger eat and was wearing her 
seat belt, according to guyen. 
However, not all of the passengers 
were buckled in . 

"There were nine people in the 
ca r," he said . " I-low could we all be 
wearing seat belts?"

2 NEW T HE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 2005 

I BRIEFLY 
Study: High school dropout 

rate rising across nation 
Between 1990 and 2000, the high school 

completion rate fell in all but 10 states, drop-
ping the United States to 10th In the world, 
according to a new study from SAT-maker 
Education Testing Service. 

The report also found that students are 
drOPPing out earlier than before - between 
ninth and 10th grade - at leasl partly as a 
result of inadequate counseling and a signifi-
cant drop in federal investment in public high 
schools. Federal government funding dropped 
from $15 billion in the 1970s to just $3 billion 
today, it stated. 

"This IS a story of losing ground," the ITS stat-
ed in the study. "At the same time that the 
dropout rate is increasing and out-of-school edu-
cation and training opportunities are dwindling. 
the economic status of young dropouts has been 
in a freefall since the late 1970s. Employment 
and earnings prospectS have declined and, even 
for those who work full-time, eamings have 
dropped steadily to averages around the poverty 
line for a family with children." 

Across the nation, more than 30 percent of 
high school students drop out before graduat-
ing, ITS found. However, the graduation rate 
varies from state to state, from a high of 88 
percent in Vermont to a low of 48 percent in 
the Distrid of Columbia. 

Campus event to mark 
101st birthday of Dr. Seuss 

UCSD will celebrate the 10 I st birthday of 
children's book author and political cartoonist 
Theodor Seuss Geisel with 2,000 pieces of 
cake for campus students, faculty and staff. At 
the March 2 celebration on Library Wal~ the 
university will also serve free punch to comple-
ment the dessert. 

Known as Dr. Seuss, the famed author died 
in La Jolla. The Geisel Library was named in his 
honor after Geisel's estate bequeathed many 
of his drawings and notebooks to the campus 
and his widow donated a substantial sum of 
money to the university's libra ries. 

Seuss' widow, Audrey Geisel, will cut the 
first piece of cake at the event. 

An inflatable "Cat in thp Har balloon will fly 
over the location of the birthday gala. 

Panelists to discuss media 
portrayal of global warming 

On the heels of a new Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography study srowing. what scientists 

say is the best proof yet of human-caused 
warming effects in the world's oceans, three 
panelists will hold an on-campus discussion to 
review the media coverage and representations 
of global warming. 

The talk will focus on the responsibility of 
journal ists, novelists and filmmakers in accu-
rately covering the scientific evidence of the 
environmental phenomenon. Titled "State of 
Fear : Hollywood, the Media and Global 
Warming, " the event is inspired by recent hits 
like Michael Crichton's new best-selling novel 
"State of Fear" and the disaster movie "The 
Day After Tomorrow:' The book suggests that 
scientific evidence of global warming is lack-
ing while the movie exaggerates the possible 
consequences of environmental problems 
linked to increased concentrations of green-
house gases. 

The event will begin March I at 4 p.m. in 
the first-floor auditorium of the Natural 
Sciences Building. It will feature documentary 
filmmaker Gene Rosow, associate history pro-
fessor Naomi Oreskes and physical sciences 
professor Dean Mark Thiemens. 

Fox to be inaugurated as 
seventh UCSD chancellor . 
UC President Robert C. Dynes will preside 

over the inauguration of Marye Anne Fox as 
UCSD's seventh chancellor in a ceremony at 
RIMAC Arena scheduled for March 3 at 10 a.m. 

UC Irvine Chancellor and newly eleded 
President of the National Academy of 
Sciences Ralph J. Cicerone will deliver the 
inaugural address. In addition, AS President 
Jenn Pae and the Graduate Student 
Association's Kris Kohler will present speech-
es at the event. 

Those in attendance will partake in a buffet 
luncheon following the ceremony. 

Medical school discovers 
early signs of Alzheimer's 
New findings from researchers at UCSD 

School of Medicine may help dodors make 
earl ier diagnoses of patients afflided by 
Alzheimer's disease. 

In a study based on mouse models and 
analysis of brain tissue from deceased 
Alzheimer's patients, the researchers said they 
found evidence suggesting that the disease 
blocks chemica l and electric signals in the brain 
much earlier than previously thought. 

The discovery could help doctors under-
stand the cause of the progressive disease that 
affects 4.5 million Americans, the researchers 
stated in a university press release.

"It has always been safe for students to go 
to Israel," Levi said. "In general, terrorism is 
way down . ... The situation is completely safe." 

Some students have gone to Israel both 
to visit and to study despite the travel warn-
ings and the lack of assistance from OAP. 

Eleanor Roosevelt College senior Shira 
Stanton said she had to withdraw from UCSD 
and enroll directly in Tel Aviv University, 
where she studied two years ago. -

In addition, Roosevelt junior Michelle 
Kerner said that she, too, will spend her senior 
year in Israel even though she has received no 
university assist2llCe from the universi ty. 

"Planning has been just shon of a night-
mare," Kerner said. "I was turned away from 
the Programs Abroad Office, but I'm still 
planning on going."

"In the past three years, more than 95 
students from UCSD alone have been to

Plan: Change will ~urt poor, Scripps Health says Crash: University providing 
counseling for Lau's friends continued from page I 

T he university's hospitals now 
trear one-third of th e county's uni n-
sured, but Scripps officials have said 
that the new plan to expand the 
Thornton Hospi tal is designed to 
COurt the wealthier patient base of 
La Jolla, a charge UCSD denies_ 

"UCS D wi ll not diminish its 
commitment to providing medical 
care for the poor," Fra nz sa id. 

However, the unil'ersity's own 
report to the regents acknowledged 
the need for more affluent patients. 

"Thornton Hospira l conrributes 
a more favorable patient payer mix 
to the system, with 88 percent of the 
hospital's discharges either privately 
insured or Medicare patients," the 
Union-Trilnmr quoted the document 
3S stating. "Though it accounts for 
less than one-fourth or the [overall 
UCSD medical] system's di s-
charges, ThorntOn Hospital con-
tributes nearly one-half of the sys-
tem's profit margin." 

cri pps has also said that the 
plan to develop the Hillcres t 
Medical Center into a free-stand- ' 
ing emergency ca re center, wi th no 
adjace nt ho pitHI, is not legal under 
California law. 

"That is not the standard of 
care. It is not even legal in 

alifornia," Stanziano said. 

"Th ere will be no surgical corre-
spondence. If someone goes there 
and needs to h ave em ergency 
surgery or has a heart attack, they 
will have to be taken to La J olla." 

H owever, the majori ty of the 
patients treated at the Hi llcrest 
Medical Center are treated on an 
outpatient basis, according to UCS D 
HeaJthcare CEO Richard Liekweg. 

" Eighty-five percent of the 
patients we see are outpatients," 
Liel .. :weg said. 

I n addition, the closing of 
UC D Hi ll cres t Hospital will 
impact Scripps Mercy Hospital in 
Hi llcrest, according to Stanziano. 

"Scripps Mercy is time -c ha l-
lenged 3S it is, " Stanziano said. 
"There is already a wait in our emer-
gency roOIll. Now those patients will 
back up ou r hospital. Mercy 
Hospital is already at capacity." 

However, Liekweg said the hos-
pital's move would cause few prob-
lems, becau e the UCSD 1edical 
Center treats patients from all over 
the county. 

"Forry-five percent of the 
patients we see are from the orth 
County region and another 9 per-
cent are from East County," 
Liekweg said. 

The cost of rebuilding the 45-
year-old UCS D Hillcrest Ho pital 

was the impetus for restructuring 
the UCS D Medi ca l Center, 
according to L iekweg. H e also said 
tha t consoli dating both hospitals 
wi ll prove to be cost-effective 
beca use the Hill crest hospita l has 
serious seismic concerns. 

"T he benefit to consolidating 
our health care is first to improve the 
qual ity of our health care," Liekweg 
said. "We think we can enhance the 
quaIity through consolidation. T he 
second reason is the high co t: We 
have to duplicate and invest in two of 
everything for both hospitals." 

UCSD H ealthcare is also one of 
the mos t profi table health care 
providers in the county and in the 
UC system. 

"They are making money," 
tanziano said . "Scripps is a non-

profit organization. We rely on the 
phi lamhropy of the community." -

Although Sranziano said Scripps 
has a 2-percem profit margin, while 
the university's profits total 7.8 per-
cent, Liekweg said the university 
does not come out ahead . 

"We target at a 6-percent profit 
margin, but after we invest in acao-
emics, it averages about 2 to 2.5 
percent," L ickweg said.

Should students fund outreach? 
Self-assessed fees for outreach would set dangerous precendent 

By BRYAN TSAO 
Opinion Editor 

Think of all the people with mo ney in Ca liforni a: Srl icon Va ll ey do c.-com-
mers, [Iollywood movie stars and 
Sa n Francisco blu t::- bloods . So 
when there's an important cause 
that needs fu nding - say, K- 12 
outreach - it's obvious where the 
state ~hould go begging for 
money: UCS D students. 

If that strikes you as a non-
sequitur, then you should oppose 
the upcomin g fee referendum 
recently approved by 
Associated Students 
that would increase 
studenr fees by $3 
starting next year to 
pay for Student-
Initiated Outreach. 

o t t hat 
S tud en t · In i ti ated 
Outreac h isn't a 
good cause ; it can 
be a valuabl e 
o pportunity fo r 
students to interact 
wi th the comm un i-
ty and help out 
those who are less 
fortun ate. But at a 
t ime wh en the 
s tate is cutting 
fu ndi ng fo r K- 12 
programs in ge ner-
al, it \ ou ld se t a 
da ngerous prece -
dent fo r student s 
to increase th eir 
t1 n3nci:ti burden . 

Pa~sin g such :1 
n:ferend um wo uld 
shtft some of the 
1I113 ncia i bu rden 
f rO Ill th c .. ta te to a 
group of 
Cal ifornI ans among 
the led>t able to pay 
more. And as good 
a cause as outreach 
is, it 's probabl y a 
bad Idea to se nd 

Sacramento the me sage that if a 
cause is important enough , stu-
dents will she ll out. It 's also prob-
abl y not the best way to express 
our collective di spleasure at rising 
student fees and falli ng financial 
aid. 

E ven if the referend um is 
passed, collecting $3 fro m eac h 
student would 
only to tal a lit-
tle more 
t h a n 

$50,000. To put that into pe rspec-
tive, th e base ball t ha t San 
Francisco G iants left-fi elde r Barty 
Bonds hit for h is record-setting 
73 rd home run sold for $450,000. 
A gr ill ed-cheese sa nd'wich pur-
ported to bear the image of the 
Virgin Mary - and with a bite 
already taken our of it - went for 
$28,000 on e Bay. Even a new 
Chevy Silverado - the official 
tru ck of an "American 
Revolution" - goes for more 
than $3 5,000. So basically, a 
grilled-cheese sandwich and a 

Silverado could pay for this wor-
thy cause, if only Sacramento 
would expend the political capital 

to increase the proposed 2005-06 
budget by about 0.O()()()OO58 

percent, or at [east to get 
some o f Gov. Arnold 
S c hw a rzenegger's 
Hollywood buddies to hold 

tel e thon 
something. 

Tr~ ditionall y, self-assessed 
fees have been used for things 
th at improve the quality o f life 
fo r students only. They're self-
assessed to pay for expenses that 
we ca n't justify to California's 
taxpa yers, such 3'S RIMAC or 
Student Center. But to change 
the nature of the fees to include 
funding for general policy initia-
tives is like painting a giant target 
on the collective backs - and 
wallets - of students. The next 
thing you know, we could be pay-
ing for everything from a larger 

porti~n of financial aid to wage 
increases for UC staff members.· 
Not that these, along with out-
reach, aren't good causes, but 
that's precisely the point. They 
are programs that serve 
California in general, which 
makes it ludicrous that the bur-
den for paying for them should 
fall soley on the shoulders of col-
lege students. 

So as the referendum 
approaches, remember thi s: It's 
not about the cause, it's about the 
principle. If the state proposed a 
special ta on UCSD students to 
pay for something that didn 't 
directly benefit UCSD students, 
but benefited the state as a whole, 
student groups would probably be 
up ill. arms. 

UndoubtedJy, the sta te is in a 
tight fi nancial situation a nd a 
California ns, we should all do our 
part to promote fiscal responsi -
bili ty. But if the situation is so 
d ire t hat Schwarzenegger needs 
to hi t up stude nts for SoOK , then 
we shoul d probably m ove to 
Oregon. 

Look for another 
take on the 

referendum in 
Thursday's issue 
of the GUllrdJlln.

indecent 
exposure

I t was horrifying. My compur-er was being repaired , and suddenly I was the most pro-
ductive person o n the pl an et . 
With in stant messaging, 
CollegeHumor, the Faceboo k, 
SomethingAwful, the Superfic ial, 
Salon, Google N ews and all of 
my other favori te des troyers of 
my time all suddenly ripped away 
from me, I didn 't know what to 
do. So I went to the grocery sto re 

-and compared prices on di ffe re nt 
types of.oranges. I r ead for cla ss-

. es. I stud ied for a mi dterm for 
more th an 20 minutes. ] cl eaned 
my room . I paid bill s. I Cllt fun ny 
cartoons out of o ld N ew Yorker 
magazi n es . r cooked . I did la un-
dry. G od, it was awfu l. 

I had gobs of ti me and wasn't 
sure wh at to do wi th it. "[s this 
wh at li fe was li ke befo re t he 
In ternet?" r asked mysclf, .sta ring 
slack-jawed at MTV while doing 
ca listhenics in my living room . 
And thcn I £tlrned off the TV and 
went for a run, because I was just 
tha t bo rcd . 

The trouble began last Frid ay, 
wh en I did a pre t ty stupid thing 
by my standards, whi ch by every-
one elsc's stand ards is reall y fan-
ta sticall y s tupid. Before a week-
end tr ip to Vegas, 1 was sitting in 
the Ex presso Roma coffec shop 
on our own humbl e campus with 
the Holy Tri ni ty - laptop, digita l 
camera and coffee cup - sta-
tio ncd atop the tiny ta ble in front 
of me. To maximize my di gital 
camera 's ~tu ra g~ c3 f.'3ci ty for 
b[ackm ail -w rtlly photos, I was 
planning to wipe its memory card 
by transferring some old photos 
to my hard drive. 

But first , I had to pump my 
coffee full of sugar, and t11is is 
where things went horribly, irrev-
ocably wrong. Mistake #1 : order -
ing coffee in the first place . 
Mistake '2 : taking the lid off the 
coffee. Mistake #3 : being an 
uncoordinated , bumbling idiot 
and managing to spray a shower 
of coffee all over the laptop. 

It was Iilc.e the moment after 
you hit someone with your car or 
come home to find your house on 
fire: You know something really 
bad has happened, but you can't 
fully grasp its significance, so you 

. just stand (or sit) there, not mov-
ing a muscle, s[owly processing 
the situation . 

Witnesses to the accident have 
yet to ve rify this , but I'm pretty 
sure I spent at leas t fi fteen sec-
ond's doing just that. I stared at 
my newl y caffeinated machine, 
stupefied . Finally I walked calml y 
to the nearest napkin. holder, too k 
out a fi stful of napkins, walked 
back to my table and started sob-
bing uncontroll ably. OK, so I 
didn 't so b - it 's no t like I' d 
dumped t he entire c up of co ffee 
on the computer, onl y a lit tle bit .

~olumn: Laptop loss could help with exams 
continued from page 4 

I frantically dabbed at the tabl e , 
the laptop screen, the keyboa rd , 
the cord for my camera and the 
pile of change I'd laid out onto 
the table for a c roi ssant (I'm 
broke, OK?) . 

Then the keyboard began mal-
functioning spectacularly, and I 
knew I was fucked . 

And when my friendly neigh-
borhood computer whiz was 
unable to file it, I knew things 
would get elepensive. 

Thank G od for c redit cards: It 
cost a cool $129 to file the thing. 
But more torturous were the five -
days - weekdays' - when I was 
without my primary mode of 
entertainment, co mmunicati o n 
and procrastination. ow that my 
coffee-scented machine is back in 
my hand s, my prodllct ivity has 
gone out the wi ndow once again, 
but at least ['m once again able to 
focus on what's m lly important in 
life. 

I'm sure you all can relate, and if 
you can't, you're either lying or you 
aren't a true college student. 
H owever, I recount my tale not 

" The Mamwns were onto

take over the world, I 

wouldn't be surprised. " 
onl y so you can laugh at m y 
expense (a lthough isn 't it reall y

lesson here: D on't drink coffee. As 
warm , dark and inviting as it may 
be, it secretly pl ots to destroy all of 

Demonstrations: Publicity 
stunts don't further cause

acts comm itred on a public walk-
way. Finally, the event perpetuated 
hurtful , nega tive and inaccurate 
stereotypes of homosexu als held by 
C hristian extremists - that gay 
peopl e don't respect people's val-
ues, that th ey're hypersexual, that 
they have no sense of propriety. 
Whether o r not students believe in 
the morality of a queer relati on-
ship, they should not be subjected 
to having the physica lity of one -
or of any relationshi p, for tha t mat-
ter - blatantly shoved at them in a 
public pl ace. 

For York, the LGBTQIA, and 
others who claim that thei r

to those who ac tually are. We 
ca n 't ban such indivi duals from 
pub[icly proving themselves foo l-

th at next time they' ll consi der th e

us. It wants to sap our fluids, keep 
us up all night when we need sleep, 
stain our tee th, give us corpse

electronics. The Mormons were 
onto something when they banned 
caffeine from their diets . They 
mow something we don't. If they 
take over the world, I wouldn't be 
surprised . 

Oh, and one last thing. With 
finals approaching, turn off the 
damn computer (or spill something 
on it!) and you 'll have nothing to

but think of how productive you'll

Motivated, accomplished and hardworking: that i how a middle school student per-
ceives a UCSD undergraduate. But to 
the sixth-graders at local public school 
Muirlands Middle School, UCSD tu-
dents are more than admirable people: 
They ' re also friends . 

"[Six-graders] are at an age when 
they're tarring to get into the world," 
said Lori Hwangbo, John Muir College 
junior and co-director of the UCSD 
mentoring program Friend 
Understanding Needs (F.U.N.). 
" People start to influence them their 
first year of junior hi gh, and we want 
to be positivc role models." 

Established in 1989, the student-run 
mcntori ng program teaches UC 0 tu-
dcnts how to communicate and be big 
brothers and sisters to "at-risk" sixth-
g raders. The 32 mentors in the program 
arc trained to support these underprivi-
leged kid . specifically those students 
in need of academic, social and emo-
tional support. The UCSD student pro-
vide positive role model s and conSLant 
friends for the children of Muiriands 
Middle School. 

"We' re privileged LO show them the 
opportuniti es that can come wi th col-
lege," Hw'angbo sa id . "We're from a 
background where Lgoing to] college is 
assumed. Why can't they have that 
upport unity?" 

La. t fall, 32 UCSD undergraduate 
applicants were selected to be paircd 
with 32 participating men tees by the 
four student director of F.U.N. They 
underwent training and then began 
interacting with their mentees. Each 
mentor is encouraged to visit the mid-
dle school campus twice a week to Visit 
his or her a signed student. 

Each academic quarter, mentors take 
tbeir men tee out for a special day of 
fun. During fall quarter, the group coor-
dinated Sports Day, where kids had the 
opportunity to tour the UCSD campu , 
engage with other mentors and 
mentees, and participate in games that 
helped build teamwork and leader hip 
skills. Mentors and men tees were able 
to get acquainted in activ ities such as 
red rover, dwarves and wizards, tug-of-
war, soccer and football. 

On Feb. 26, the mentors took all 32 
mentees to the San Diego Zoo, which 
subsidized the tickets so the kids could 
enjoy a day of quality time with their 
mentors and friend . 

"The San Diego Zoo ' has been 
incredibly supportive," said Kiki 
Boddula, the program 's co-director. 

State budget cuts have had a signifi -
cant effect on outreach programs, and 
F. .N., one of six volunteer programs 
upported by Associated Students, ha 

felt the pinch. 
"We have received Ie s funding for 

events thi s year than la t year," 
Boddula aid . 

Budget cutbacks have forced F.U .N. 
directors to reassess their finan c ial 
mean and redirect their funds. 

Mentors may have to help pay for 
their co ts on events like the zoo. 
Addi tionally, " ' -Want -To-Go-To-
College Day," the last big gathering of 
the year, will have to be modified . In 

" We're from a background 
where [going to] college is 
assumed, Why can't they 

have that opportunity? 
- Lori Hwangbo. 

John Muir College junior 
the past, men tees have received prizes. 
Thi s year, while UCSD Bookstore may 
help subsidize cost, the directors are 
encouraging mentors to make gift for 
their mentee this year, s ince outside 
funding is more scarce than in previous 
years. 

Another big event for the pro-
gram is the end-of-the-year barbe-
cue, where mentors and director 
come together to encourage one 
another and talk about their expe-
riences with their mentees . Whi le 
F.U.N. wi ll receive some subsi-
dization from A sociated 
Students, the rest of the money for 
the barbecue will have to come 
fro m other sources or students' 
pockets. 

" We basically have to be more 
economic," Boddula said . 

During the second week of 
spring quarter, EU.N. will go to 
Sea _ World for its quarterly trip. 

orld will donate tickets for 
50 men tors and men tees to visit 
die 'Park for free. 

In spite of budget cutbacks, the 
program is till running in full 
force, serving a a testament to 
the organization's determination 
to provide pos itive role models 
for these children.

For a break, take a hike OQINK TANK 
Choice nature trails for San Diegans 

8y LAURA CANTER 
Staff Writer 

Is there life off campus and 
away from the beach ? If loud 
music or alcoholic drinks don't 
appeal, try reinvigorating your-
self with the natural beauty of 
San Diego. 

Inland San Diego is ahunda nt 
with nature ; Los Peiiasquitos 
Canyon Reserve, Torrey Pines 
State Reserve and the Marian R. 
Bear Memorial Park each provide 
a break from the city. 

The Los Pefiasqui tos Canyon 
Re erve's trail is a great destina-
tion for hikers, bikers and horse-
back riders. California live oaks 
and sycamores and more than 500 
species of plants, 140 avian and 
reptile types, and cou ntless 
amph ibians and fish live on the 
park' 3,270 acres of terrain. 

1 n and around the canyon, vis-
itors ca n find acorn woodpecker 
holes in pieces of bark, animal 
tracks in the mud , coast prickly 
pears, coyote bushe and black 
sage. Keep in mind though, the 
park is al a home to rattlesnakes, 
mountain lions, poison oak and 
rough terrain. Because parks of 
this son are so rare in an Diego, 
thei r pre ervation is imperative, 
and all vi itors are rcquired to 
leave the park just as it looked 
when they found it. .II dogs must 
be leashed, and, of cou rse, 
clean cd up after, and guns of any 
so rt are prohibited. I t is best to 
wear a comfortablc pair of hiking 
boots or tennis shoes, put on 
some sun creen and bring plcnty 
of water. 

From UCSD, take Intersta te 5 
north to Ilighway 56 cast, take 

the Black Mountain Road exit 
and turn right. T he Los 
Pefiasquitos Canyon Reserve is at 
the bottom of Black Mountain 
Road across from the horse park. 

Located between La Joll a and 
Del Mar, Torrey Pines State 
Reserve features eight miles of 
trails, a visitor center and guided 
nature walks on weekends and 
holidays. Out o n the trails, there 
are panoramic views of th e 
reserve, ocean, lagoon and inland 
areas. Hikers are able to enjoy the 
native Torrey Pine trees, one of 

Torth America's most uncom-
mon pines. Only two nati ve 
stands exist: one in coastal San 
Diego and the other on Santa 
Ro a fsland near Santa Barbara. 
Hikers may also observe 
California poppies, the state 

wildflower, coast cholla, and 
more than 400 species of native 
flora across the 2,000-acre 
reserve. Countless species of 
birds and insects also inhabit the 
reserve. Park r~ngers suggest 
staying on de ignated trai ls, and 
moking, picni cs, dogs and horses 

a re prohibited. 0 bicycles are 
allowed on the trails and the col-
lection of pine cones or wild 
fl ower of any kind is not tolerat-
ed, as these items must be left to

Hike: Nature walks just a 
five .. minute drive away 
contin~d from page 8 

beautiful Pacific Ocean. 
From UCSD, take Interstate 5 

north to the Carmel Valley Road 
exit and drive west for about 1.5 
mil es to the Coast Highway 101 . 
Turn left and proceed along the 
beach for about a mile. :rhe park 
entrance is on the right just before 
the highway begins to climb the 
Torrey Pines f,rrade. There is a $6 
parking fee for any car enterin g 

" 

the center of Clairemont going 
east, and into Rose Canyon goi ng 
north and south toward Pacific 
Beach. Within the park, more 
cha llenging hiking trails lead up to 
the mesa tops for those who w~nt 
to test their strength. Giant oak 
and sycamore trees line the nar-
row trai ls, next to a creek that runs 
through the canyon. The trail 
extending toward Rose Canyon 
run s parallel wi th the train tracks, 

Torrey Pines Sta te 
Re erve. The rese rve 
is open daily from 8 
a.m. to 7 p.m. and 
the Visitor Center 
opens daily at 9 a.m . 

The Visitor 
Center and Ranger 
Station are located in 
a building built in 
1922 . Originally 
called t he Torrey 
Pines Lodge, it is 
now a showcase for 
di Fferen t forms of 
wild animal and 

These Incations 
provide acres of 
lush chaparrals 
and tall l gre£?1 

hills just waiting 

which provides a 
great diversion and 
change of scenery 
during a naUl re hike. 

A picnic area and 
bathrooms are also 
available just before 
the hiking trail 
begins, and the same 
rules that apply to 
the other parks are 
important for this 
delicate habi tat: 

to be admired. " Most importantly, 
keep it clean. Bags 

plant life that ca n be seen on the 
trails. Think of it as a preview 
before starting the hike. The 

. building also provides information 
about the park, and souvenirs 
galore. 

Last but not least is the Marian 
R. Bear Memorial Park, a 467-
acre natural-resource-based park 
in the heart of San Clemente 
Canyon, bounded by highways 5, 
52 and 805. A kiosk at the 
entrance of the park includes 
information about birds, coyotes 
and various species of insects that 
can be found on the trails, and a 
fascinating diagram of the geology 
of San Clemente Canyon . T h e 
park co nsists of three miles of 
mostly n at trails along the length 
of the canyon dlat extent! up into 

are provided a t the 
trail entrance for those who are 
walking their dogs. The park also 
allows bicyclists to enjoy the trails, 
but be forewuned that there are 
some very steep hills. 

From UCSD, take 5 .south to 
52 east and take the Claire mont 
Mesa Boulevard/Regents Road 
exit. Turn right on Clairemont 
Mesa Boulevard and make an 
immedia te right onto the road 
that leads to the parking lot of the 
park. 

The e locations provide acres 
of lush chaparrals and tall, green 
hill just waiting to be admired ., 
While San Diego's weather has 
dampened the mood for outdoor 
activities of late. future days 
promise clearer skies for breath-
taking views. •

continued from page r 2 
the Tritons after missing two free-

another defensive rebound and

his shoulders and got the shot off

effect, the ball rolled around the

Tritons beat Toros at the buzzer 
Lewkowitz's three-pointer seals comeback 

Andrew Mo/GuorrJion 
Hero: Fans rushed the court after sophomore guard Mark Lewkowitz's three-pointer bounced around the rim, then rolled 
in as time expired in the fourth quarter of the Tritons' 74-72 win over Cal State Dominguez Hills on Feb. 25. 

By JOE TEVELOwm 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's basketball 
team concluded its final home-
stand of the season in high style. 
The Tritons beat Cal State 
Dominguez I-Iills, 74-72, on Feb. 
26 following a dramatic 23-5 
comeback run, capped by a 
buzzer-beating three-pointer by 
sophomore guard Mark 
Lewkowitz. The victory came 
after a frustrating 70-50 loss to 
Cal Poly Pomona pn Feb. 25. 

Against Cal State Dominguez 
Hills (7- 17 overall, 6-11 
Calif ,rnia Collegiate Athletic 
Association), the Tritons (11-13 
overall, 7-11 CCAA) found 
themselves at the mercy . of 

another early deficit. UCSD was 
already down by double digits 
with just over five minutes played 
in the game, and fell behind by as 
many as 17 with a little more 
than six minutes left in the first 
half. However, successful three-
point field goal attempts by 
sophomore guard Robby Peters 
and freshman guards Clint Allard 
and Andrew Hatch, along with 
strong defensive play and 
rebounding, closed the gap to 10 
at the half. 

The Toros were able to hold 
their double-digit lead for most 
of the second half and stretched 
it to a 16-point advantage at the 
9: 15 mark. The Toro offense 
went cold as Triton defensive 
intensity continued, feeding off 

20 Dominguez Hills turnovers. 
UCSD was within strikjng 

distance after Peters' fourth con-
verted three-pointer of the game 
cut the lead to 69-72 with two 
minutes left in regulation. 

The Toros worked the clock 
before Quishawn Harrell missed 
a jumper with 1:33 left to play. 
Sophomore forward Parker 
Berling secured the rebound, and 
emerged, along with Lewkowitz, 
as a vital player in the game's 
closing moments. 

Lewkowitz converted a lay up 
with 58 seconds remaining, 
pulling the Tritons to within one 
point. Les Norman could not 
make things more difficult for

Baseball begins conference play 
Tritons win one, then split doubleheader with Gators 

By COURTNEY FIELD 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD baseball team 
finally opened confrence play this 
weekend in California Collegiate 
Athletic Association action against 
San Francisco State, after having 
been ra ined out against Cal State 
Dominguez Hills and Cal State 
San Bernardino in the preceding 
weeks. 

T he Tritons (6-2 overall, 2- 1 
CCAA) made a late run to earn the 
series' first victory, 7-6, on Feb. 
25. T he two teams split the dou-
bleheader Feb. 26, with the 
Tritons taking game one, 16-4, 
and the Gators (5-9 overall, 2-7 
CCAA) inching out the nightcap, 
5-3. Resul ts of the series' fourth 
and final game were not available 
by press time. 

In the opener, UCSD junior· 
outfielder David Gomez was the 
hero. Gomez went 3-for-4 and 
had three RBIs including a game-
winning two-out single to left 
field that plated senior outfielder 
Ryan Langone for the Triton vic-
tory. 

After falling behind 6-2 
through eight and a half innings of 
play, the Tritons rallied and scored 
four times in the bottom of the 
eighth and once in the ninth to 
pull out the win and defeat San 
Francisco State, 7-6. UC ' 0 

junior pitcher Ryan Leaxe (2-1) 
pitched a scoreless ninth inning 
and was the winning pitcher. 

The Tritons carried their 
momentum into the Feb. 26 dou-
bleheader against the Gators with 
an overwhelming 16-4 victory in 
the first game. 

UCSD senior hurler Logan 
Boutilier (3 -0) threw a stellar ball-
game and went the distance for 
the Tritons for the second straight 
game, allowing just nine hits, no 
earned runs and one walx, while 
strikjng out four. 

Offensively, UCSD jumped 
out to an early lead and scored 
five times in the first inning and 
three times in the second to go 
ahead, 8-0, after two. With the 
Tritons ahead 13-1, the Gators' 
centerfielder Carlos Medina hit a 
three-run home run to make it 
13 -4. 

In the bottom of the sixth 
inning, Gomez came through 
again for UCSD and hit a two-
run home run to extend the lead. 
The Tritons tacked on an addi-
tional run before the end of the 
inning. 

In the seven-inning nightcap, 
the bottom of the first inning and 
the top of the sixth inning 
summed up the game. The 
Tritons scored three runs in the 
first when with two outs in the 
first inning, sophomore catcher 

David Morehead, senior second 
baseman Ricky Pinocchio and 
senior third baseman Alex Gascon 
notched base hits to give UCSD a 
3-0 lead. That score held up until 
the sixth inning. 

The Gators rallied, with their 
first seven batters of the inning 
reaching base safely on a single, 
walk, single, walk, double, error 
and walle At inning's end, San 
Francisco State pushed across five 
runs to take the 5-3 lead. 

The Tritons attempted a 
comeback in the bottom of the 
seventh, but the effort would not 
be enough. With one out, junior 
centerfielder Matt Lawson 
walked and advanced to second 
on senior designated hitter Joel 
Clark's groundout. Senior short-
stop Keith Hernandez singled 
with two outs, putting runners on 
the comers. Morehead then hit 
into a fielder 's choice, ending the 
game. 

UCSD springs back into 
CCAA action March 4 and March 
5 with three games against Cal 
State Los Angeles (1-2 CCAA,2-2 
overall) at Triton Baseball 
Stadium. The first pitch is slated 
for 2 p.m. on March 4, while the 
doubleheader on March 5 will 
begin at 11 a.m. Last season, the 
'lntons met the Golden Eagles 
four times, splitting both double-
headers.

Eagles, Seawolves are 
no match for UCSD 

Hilker, Roberts, Bronowicki lift 
women's tennis to victories 

By EVAN WANG 
Staff Writer 

Members of the UCSD 
women's tennis team set a goal of 
going undefeated against 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Assoociation opponents this sea-
son, and following a pair of 
resounding victories against 
Sonoma State on Feb. 25 and Cal 
State Los Angeles on Feb. 26, the 
team is well on its way. 

UCSD athletes were at the top 
of their games, defeating both 
opponents by match scores of 8-1 . 
Strong individual efforts were plen-
tiful, with many players competing 
in both singles and doubles match-
es to pick up multiple wins for 
UCSD (5-0 overall, 2-0 CCAA). 
Juniors Marissa Hilxer and Leigh 
Roberts and sophomore Kristin 
Bronowickj each did double duty 
and went 4-0 for the weekend (2-0 
in both singles and doubles play). 

The women traveled to Los 
Angeles on Feb. 26 to taxe on the 
Cal State Los Angeles Eagles. In 
their first away match of the season, 
the Tritons took an early 3-0 lead, 
thanks to wins in all three doubles 
matchups. No. 1 tandem junior 
Tara Siddiqui and sophomore 
Marsha Malinow defeated the 
Eagles' Kim Godoy and Ronalyn 
Miller, 8-4. Sophomores 
Bronowioo and Katie McKee han-
dled Cal State Los Angel~' Kimmy 
Barnes and Maggie Bollinger at the 
No. 2 spot, 8-5, and Hilker and 
Roberts took down Dana Popescu 
and Charise Godoy, 8-3. 

"Wmning our doubles matches 
really helps improve our confi-
dence going into the singles match-
es," Malinow said. "But we never 
want to be overconfident or under-
confident. Our goal is to get to the 
point where everybody has a good 
day every match day." 

On the singles side, the Tritons 
wer just as dominanl, will. No. 1 
Malinow (d. C. Godoy, 6-3, 6-3), 
No. 2 I-IiIker (d. Bollinger 6-0, 6-
3), No.4 Roberts (d. Miller, 6-4, 
6-0), No. 5 Bronowicki (d. 
Barnes, 6-1, 7-6), and No.6 
Liz Brown (d. K.. Godoy 
6-0, 6-0) all winning in 
straight sets. No. 3 
Siddiqui feU, 4-6, 3-6, to 
Popescu. 

On Feb. 25, the Tritons 
hosted Sonoma State at the 
Northview Courts in their first 
conference match of the year. 
The Seawolves came in with 
upset on their minds, but the 
Tritons crushed those hopes 
quickly and emphatically, taXing 
all three doubles matches. Hillter 
and Roberts set the tone at the No. 
3 spot with an 8-1 victory. 
Bronowioo and McKee followed 
suit with an 8-4 victory at the No.2 
spot and Malinow and Siddiqui bat-
tled back from a 5-6 deficit, winning 
three straight games to finish, 8-6, at . 
the No. 1 spot. 

The women built on this 
momentum in singles play, winning 
five of six. Hilker, Siddiqui , 
Roberts, Bronowickj and Brown aU 
scored victories for the Tritons. 
Sonoma's Brianna Bailey saved the 
Seawolves from the goose egg, nar-
rowly defeating Malinow at the 
No. I spot, 7-6, 7-5. 

Bronowickj has been a large 
part of the Tritons' success. Besides 
going undefeated for the weekend, 

she has not lost a match aU year, 
and has an overall record of 10-0. 

" [Bronowickj] didn 't get a 
chance to play singles last year, but 
we always knew she had the poten-
tial ," head coach Liz LaPlante said. 
"She's gotten her chance this sea-
son, and is playing really, really 
well. She could play and do well at 
any spot in the lineup." 

The Tritons' hot start has 
earned them the ninth ranking in 
the nation from the Intercollegiate 
Tennis Association (ITA) in its 
Feb. 23 release. 

"We're happy with our results 
so far, but we always strive to be 
better," LaPlante said. "Our com-
petition hasn't been the most diffi-
cult so far - teams that we're 
going to have to face doWn the 
road at Regionals and Nationals 
will certainly be way tougher. 
We're not at full strength; we have 
a couple of injuries to starters that 
we've had to work around. Doubles 
play is ahead of where it was last 
year." 

The busy weekend was a change 
for the team, after its past four 
matches were rained out. UCSD 
will have to reschedule away match-
es against conference opponents Cal 
Poly Pomona, Cal State Bakersfield 
and Cal State San Bernardino. 

The Tritons next host Cal Poly 
Pomona on March 2 at 2 p.m. at 
the Northview Courts, then will 
travel north for away matches 
against San Jose State on March 4 
and Sonoma State on March 5. 

"San Jose State [a Division I 
program] should be a good indica-
tor of where we are," LaPlante 
said. 

GIes Dlle/Gumdian 
On t.rpt: Sophomore Marsha 
Malinow and the UCSD women's tennis 
team are undefeated this season.
