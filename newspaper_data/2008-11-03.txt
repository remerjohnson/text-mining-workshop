A
COUNCIL SPLIT ON LOFT FUNDING

ERIK JEPSEN/GUARDIAN
The Loft’s Folk Series kicked off Nov. 2 with Frank Fairfield. A.S. funding for the new campus nightclub, 
which typically hosts several musical performances each week, is currently under debate.

When the campus dining facilities 
opened their doors this year, visitors 
found new bins designated for com-
postable items placed alongside the 
usual trash and recycling receptacles. 
However, because a large-scale cam-
pus-composting program has yet to be 
established at UCSD, the contents of 
these new bins are currently disposed 
of as trash. 

The only active composting area  
available on campus is a student-
operated facility located next to the 
Challenge Course in east campus.

Run by student organization the 
Compostables — in coordination 
with Housing & Dining Services, 
Auxillary and Plant Services and Plant 
Management  — the project was found-
ed last year on a site temporarily made 
available by Director of Sports Facilities 
Donald E. Chadwick.

According to Compostables mem-
ber and Thurgood Marshall College 
senior June Reyes, the small-scale site 
will begin collecting preconsumer 
material, which is waste material pro-

duced during food preparation (such 
as vegetable clippings), from a yet-to-
be-determined dining facility later this 
month. The organization also plans to 
begin composting preconsumer waste 
from the Faculty Club. 

“Although the dining halls haven’t 
begun composting food waste entirely, 
it is a good first step forward on educat-
ing students and creating habits of sep-
arating compostable food waste so that 
when composting begins it will be done 
most efficiently,” Reyes said. “By the 
end of the school year we will be able 
to compost 100 pounds of food waste 
efficiently at the composting site.”

The Compostables are also investi-
gating the merits of various composting 
methods, such as vermicomposting, 
the use of specially bred earthworms to 
break down organice material, and will 
soon make a recommendation as to 
which methodology best suits UCSD.

“We are striving to compost food 
waste campuswide in the next two 
years either on campus or off cam-
pus, depending on the research and 
outcomes of the current composting 
project,” Reyes said. “Composting will 
happen at UCSD, it’s just a matter of 

Dining Hall Compost Program Still in the Works

By Jesse Alm

With a historic activity-fee referen-
dum now slated for the ballot early next 
quarter, questions surrounding future 
funding for the Loft — UCSD’s new 
nightclub — continue to divide A.S. 
councilmembers and rekindle decades-
old grievances regarding student life 
on campus.

At its meeting last week, the council 
approved a measure that would increase 
quarterly student fees by $19.82, but 
ultimately tabled further discussion 
of the Loft’s proposal to include an 
additional $2.65 for its arts and music 
programming. The addendum would 
supply the Loft with $133,000 annually, 
accounting for 25.9 percent of its total 
budget.

The venue, now in its second month 
of operation, received an initial $3 mil-
lion construction investment from Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Joseph W. 
Watson in spring 2006 after the Alumni 
Affairs Department backed out of a 
plan to turn the space into an alumni 
visitor center and meeting room.

Though compost bin 
contents are now thrown 
away, student org plans 
permanent organic-waste 
disposal facility for UCSD.

The contents of the new, brightly labeled composting bins at Sierra Summit and other dining halls are 
disposed of along with regular trash due to the absence of a large-scale composting site at UCSD.

After a tumultuous year and a half 
of protest by students, teaching assis-
tants and faculty, Thurgood Marshall 
College writing sequence Dimensions 
of Culture will be reassessed by a yet-
to-be-appointed steering committee in 
Spring Quarter 2009.

The TMC administration began 
adjusting the program’s structure last 
quarter, guided by recommendations 
from both a faculty and student review 
committee. Among administrators’ chief 
concerns was identifying a seasoned 
faculty member to lead the troubled 
program, while giving adequate direc-
tion to the committee review process. 

Literature professor Robert Cancel 
and communication professor Robert 
Horwitz stepped up to the position, 
replacing former D.O.C. Director 
Abraham Shragge. 

“One of the strongest recom-
mendations in the D.O.C. report that 
was authored by the [faculty] TMC 
Curriculum Committee was that 
D.O.C. be directed by regular ladder-
rank, senior faculty,” Cancel said.

According to an update posted on 
the TMC Web site, Cancel and Horwitz 
enacted the first changes to the pro-
gram even before the beginning of this 
academic year. Minor adjustments have 

been made to the TA orientation that 
occurs prior to Fall Quarter, geared at 
increasing collaboration between fac-
ulty and their TAs.

“[These changes] were designed to 
make the teaching of the course more 
collegial, with a good working relation-
ship between TAs and faculty lecturers,” 
Cancel said.

Students and TAs have expressed 
concerns that D.O.C. has strayed from its 
original mission and that the program’s 
original guidelines, which require TMC 
students to confront cultural, social and 
racial norms in the United States over 
three courses, were not being met.

“There was a sense that the courses 
were being ‘watered down’; the contro-
versial issues were not being met head-
on,” former D.O.C. TA Tania Jabour 
said. “It seemed like the former director 
did not want to rock anyone’s boat.”

In addition, the original format 
of the courses asked for a team of 
ladder-rank, or tenured, professors 
to lead the program. D.O.C. had zero 
such faculty members in its program 
during the 2007-08 school year, 
according to Cancel and Horwitz. 

The two professors are currently 
looking into developing a team of nine 
to 12 faculty members to lead the for-
mation of a new program for the 2009-

This is a landmark year in 
which students will receive not 
two, but seven polling locations 
— one per college, except in the

and Thurgood Marshall College, 
which will share RIMAC. 

And the excitement won’t 
die just because the booths shut 
down. UCSD’s first-ever presi-

UCSD scientists have devel-
oped a novel software program 
that is able to duplicate a key 
using only a photograph, without 
actually needing the physical key. 

“We built our key-duplication 
software system to show people 
that their keys are not inherently 
secret,” computer science profes-
sor Stefan Savage said. “Perhaps 
this was once a reasonable 
assumption, but advances in digi-
tal imaging and optics have made 
it easy to duplicate someone’s 
keys from a distance without them 
even noticing.”

The technology allows the sci-
entists to duplicate the “bumps 
and valleys” on a key that repre-
sent the specific numeric code 
unique to the key.

Savage presented the find-
ings of the student-led project to 
the Association for Computing 
Machinery’s Conference on 
Communications and Computer 
Security last week.

In demonstrations of the pro-
cess, computer scientists were 
able to create identical copies of 
a common residential key from a 
picture taken with a cell phone and 
from a photograph of a key sitting 
at a table 200 feet away. 

“This idea should come as little 
surprise to locksmiths or lock ven-
dors,” Savage said. “There are 
experts who have been able to 
copy keys by hand from high-
resolution photographs for some 
time. However, we argue that 
the threat has turned a corner — 
cheap image sensors have made 
digital cameras pervasive and 
basic computer vision techniques 
can automatically extract a key’s 
information without requiring any 
expertise.”

To protect against the possible 
threats key duplication technology 
poses, Savage warns that people 
should treat their keys like they 
would treat their credit cards by 
keeping them in their wallet or 
pocket until needed and making 
sure pictures of their keys aren’t 
posted online. 

“If you go onto a photo-sharing 

site such as Flickr, you will find 
many photos of people’s keys that 
can be used to easily make dupli-
cates,” Savage said. “While peo-
ple generally blur out the numbers 
on their credit cards and driver’s 
licenses before putting those pho-
tos online, they don’t realize that 
they should take the same precau-
tions with their keys.”

UCSD School of Medicine pro-
fessor of cellular and molecular 
medicine Ajit Varki, M.D., is part of 
an international team of research-
ers that recently published find-
ings linking the consumption of 
red meat to food-poisoning bac-
teria.

Published in an advanced 
issue of Nature, the researchers 
discovered that a potent bacterial 
toxin called subtilase cytotoxin 
specifically targets human cells 
that have a nonhuman, cellular 
molecule on their surface — typi-
cally absorbed into the body 

through red meat. 
The targeted molecule, called N-

glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), is 
not produced naturally in humans, 
but can arise through the consump-
tion of contaminated red meat. Very 
low or undetectable levels of Neu5Gc 
are found in fruits, vegetables, eggs, 
poultry and fish.

If produced by certain strands 
of E. Coli bacteria, infection can 
result in bloody diarrhea aemo-
lytic uraemic syndrome, potentially 
fatal in humans.

“Ironically, humans may set 
themselves up for an increased 
risk of illness from this kind of E. 
coli bacteria present in contami-
nated red meat or dairy, because 
these very same products have 
high-levels of Neu5Gc,” Varki 
said. “The Neu5Gc molecule is 
absorbed into the body, making 
it a target for the toxin produced 
by E. coli.”

To prevent contamination, the 
study emphasized the importance 
of only eating well-cooked meat or 
pasteurized dairy products, ensur-
ing the destruction of contami-
nated bacteria.

Campus Sustainability Coordinator 
Maggie Souder said the program will 
include all campus food wastes, adding 
that the location of the current small-
scale composting site is temporary and 
that the space has already been allo-
cated for another function.

She explained that a large-scale 
composting site can be planned either 
on or off campus.

“We’re moving as fast as we can but 
[there are] limited options and space on 
campus,” Souder said.

Both Souder and Reyes are unsure 
of how long-term plans to expand com-
posing will play out.

“We’re concentrating on meeting 
our goal that we have right now,” Reyes 
said of the program’s hopes to compost 
100 pounds of food by the end of the 
year. “Future plans aren’t certain. It all 
depends on the research and the out-
comes when we finish.”

Souder, though also unsure of where 
future plans might lead, suggested the 
possibility of incorporating methods 
such as vermiculture and biodigestion.

“We’re going to do a study,” Souder 
said. “That may mean hiring a consul-
tant who’s familiar with different alter-
natives for industrial-scale composting 
who can make a recommendation spe-
cific to the needs of UCSD.”

According to Souder, sustainabil-
ity efforts on campus will focus on 
diverting 100 percent of waste through 
a combination of recycling and com-
posting by 2020, and establishing a 
program that will be sustainable over 
an extended period of time.

10 academic year.
The implementation of program 

reforms will also be guided by a steering 
committee consisting of faculty mem-
bers, TMC undergraduates and D.O.C. 
teaching assistants. The committee will 
work toward implementing further 
changes to the program recommended 
by both the faculty and student review 
committees. 

Horwitz and Cancel held meetings 
with D.O.C. 1 and D.O.C. 2 lecturers 
to decide on a standard tone and struc-
ture for the courses and interactions 
between students and TAs.

Cancel said that major changes 
would not be immediately implement-
ed, as the course reformatting process 
requires a staff willing to teach multi-
disciplinary courses. He added that it 
is possible that the steering commit-
tee and new faculty will rethink the 
entire format of D.O.C.’s three-course 
sequence.

“To be fair to the new team of fac-

ulty and to ensure proper preparation 
of the new courses, we had to make this 
year, in practical terms, a bridge from 
the version that was taught the last few 
years and the new one to be taught in 
2009-10,” Cancel said. 

The TMC administration will 
gradually appoint members to the 
new steering committee throughout 
the quarter. Cancel said that over the 
course of the year, transitions between 
the first D.O.C. class and the last would 
be examined to understand how con-
tinuity and standardization may better 
be established between courses, as well 
as within the course readings.

“As we look at this year’s [classes], 
we are striving for a little more con-
tinuity both between topics, themes, 
and issues that should flow through 
the entire year and also between the 
three large lectures offered each quar-
ter,” Cancel said.

at j3gutier@ucsd.edu.

University Events Office Director 
and ArtPower! Artistic Director Martin 
Wollesen said subsidizing the project 
was a risk, but that it was proposed 
in response to years of data compiled 
in the 2005 Undergraduate Student 
Experience and Satisfaction Committee 
Report, which emphasized the need for 
a “greater physical, social and emo-
tional community” and more “cultural 
competency” at UCSD. He said the 
university’s investment in the Loft indi-
cates a serious effort to address these 
concerns.

“I think students should feel really 
good that the administration really 
heard students and invested in creat-
ing a space and programming that has 
been responding to the concerns that 
students have had for years,” he said.

Since its opening on Sept. 25, the 
Loft has hosted events roughly six 
nights per week with a schedule includ-
ing food- and wine-tasting activities, 
open mics, a student storytelling series 
and live musical performances. Bands 
have ranged from indie rockers Rogue 
Wave to alternative rap icon Busdriver 
to jazz, swing, tango and Indian fusion 
group Rupa and the April Fishes.

According to A.S. President Donna 
Bean, most councilmembers support 
the Loft’s programming and recognize 
its potential impacts on UCSD cul-
ture and community, but many feel 
that the request for student funding 
— first presented to the council Oct. 15 
— lacks mechanisms for direct student 
oversight and suggests a business plan 
based only on financial speculation.

“Yet again, administrators were not 
responsible and, yet again, they’re try-
ing to get us to foot the bill,” she said. 
“The Loft is asking for an extension of 
the Price Center expansion activity fee 
that students are already paying.”

Bean also drew parallels to the 
2007 athletic-fee referendum, which 
outraged many students in alotting a 
percentage of the additional revenue to 
the construction of the RIMAC Annex 
— scheduled to house conference 
rooms, a convenience store and a cafe 
beginning in spring 2009.

“Just like with athletics, we’re seeing 
people want to jump on the back of the 
referendum, and it’s going to hurt [its] 
legitimacy,” Bean said.

Wollesen said it is true that Loft 
staff members entered this year with 
financial gaps to fill, but that if students 
are determined to change their campus, 
they must participate in the process by 
way of attendance, feedback and finan-
cial support.

“Our job is to create a space that is 
reflective not only of what UCSD is, 
but what UCSD will become,” he said. 
“It makes sense that we, as a commu-
nity space, share the responsibility as 
a community. It’s going to be a teeny 
amount of money to support upwards 
of 250 events a year that are basically 

free for students. That’s a pretty small 
investment.”

But Associate Vice President of 
Finance and Resources Naasir Lakhani 
said the council’s preparation for the 
referendum is an act of necessity, not 
desire.

“A.S. is in a financial crisis, and 
when we put something like the Loft in, 
it undermines the message of our refer-
endum,” he said. “A.S.’s primary focus 
should be passing this referendum. 
Otherwise, we’re completely screwed. 
There’s nothing left.”

Associate Vice President of Student 
Life Darryl Nousome added that the 
council must consider the moral impli-
cations of supporting an enterprise that 
is not completely student-run.

“While I love the programming 
that’s going on, it’s unfair to ask stu-
dents to pay for this,” he said. “It’s not a 
large amount, but in principle, it means 
a lot.”

Wollesen said that although the Loft 
receives funding from multiple univer-
sity departments, 15 of its 17 permanent 
staff members are students. In addition, 
he said A.S. Programming books the 
Loft’s weekend acts and all six colleges 
have student representation on the advi-
sory committee for Student Registration 
Fee, the club’s largest sponsor.

“At the end of the day, this is a 
student-based, artist-based program-
ming space and venue,” Wollesen said. 
“We have had students fully engaged in 
every single aspect of the management, 
the programming, the artistic liaison 
and contracting, the design of the expe-
rience and the development of partner-
ships with student voices. It’s not as if 
all of a sudden, this year, students are 
engaged in the process.”

A.S. Sixth College Senator John 
Cressey said student feedback regard-
ing the Loft has been overwhelmingly 
positive, and he urged councilmem-
bers not to write off the venue simply 
because it receives university funding.

“Although this may violate some 
moral principles or historical princi-
pals, the bottom line is it is something 
that will benefit students, and looking 
out for students is my first priority as an 
elected A.S. official,” he said.

At last week’s meeting, council-
members more or less reached a con-
sensus that if Loft funding is includ-
ed in the referendum, the issue will 
appear in a separate column on the 
ballot.

Cressey said he supports this com-
promise because it would grant students 
the final say. He added that despite the 
outcome, including the Loft on the bal-
lot will give students one more reason 
to vote and boost the council’s chances 
of attaining the 20-percent turnout rate 
needed for the fee increases to take 
effect.

OPINION
  

So in case you’ve been hiding out with a certain al-Qaeda terrorist in his ridiculously unfindable 
cave-spot for the last eight years, you 
should know — we’re in deep. Men in 
business suits are ready to jump out 
their 100th-story windows, the public 
school system is being all but torched 
to pay for a war we can’t finish, the 
rest of the world hates us and we’ve 
done so many Palin impressions that 
our faces just might stick this way.

The cartoonish downfall of the 
United States was actually kind of 
hilarious at one point. But now that 
the George W. Bush coffee-table 
quotebook is on its eighth edition 
and the new Republican candidate 
— with one foot in the grave and all 
other limbs unusable — has chosen a 
sassy PTA mom as his running mate, 
it’s becoming difficult for even the 
most patriotic plumber to maintain 
that all-American superpower swag-
ger without hallucinating up a couple 
weapon-of-mass-destruction shad-
ows behind him on the sidewalk.

John McCain isn’t necessarily 
Bush’s ghost come back to haunt us 
in rodent shape-shift — after all, 
undying love for the same brand of 
uber-successful, unregulated laissez-
faire capitalism aside, he can actu-
ally form quite a complete sentence 
and, well, has said a whole bunch 
of sentences about how he’s not like 

Bush at all. But at this point, we can 
all agree that it’s going to take some-
thing phenomenal to salvage the few 
scraps of reputation that do remain 
to our name.

Barack Obama is not denying what 
an astounding mess we’ve managed to 
make the last eight years (not to men-
tion the last 50), and — with a brave 
new face that political leaders around 
the world are far less likely to plaster 
on their dartboards — has single-
handedly restored a desire in even the 
most staunch anti-government types 
to dust off their Fourth-of-July flags 
and consider anew the rocket’s red 
glare. He’s ready to kick this McCain 
dude off the path, put the preach to 
practice and look damn good doing 
it; now it’s up to us to Barack the vote 
like only America can.

EDITORIAL BOARD

The UCSD Guardian is published twice a week at the 
University of California at San Diego. Views expressed 
herein represent the majority vote of the editorial board 

and are not necessarily those of the UC Board of 
Regents, ASUCSD or members of the Guardian staff. 

An image of sleek, high-tech bullet trains zipping passen-gers across the length of the 
state may seem hard to fathom for 
Californians used to plopping down 
in their gas-guzzling SUVs and sit-
ting in traffic gridlock on choked 
freeways for hours on most week-
days — but Proposition 1A makes 
the novel idea excitingly realistic 
and crucial to the well-being of the 
state’s future.

Projections indicate that the pro-
posed rail line would make trav-
eling from San Francisco to Los 
Angeles  possible in less than three 
hours for a cost of about $55. But 
aside from dramatically improving 
the flow of people across our noto-

riously crowded state — by up to 
117 million riders annually — the 
measure would also lead to reduced 
greenhouse-gas emissions as a direct 
result of less cars on the roadways, 
not to mention that the rail line 
itself would produce zero emissions. 
And although the estimated $40 
billion cost seems enormous, the 
measure asks California taxpayers 
to only foot about 25 percent of the 
total bill, with the rest of the money 
coming from federal and private 
sources.

Opponents claim that California 
cannot afford to invest so much 
money on such a lofty project during 
an economic crisis, but the rail line 
would create hundreds of thousands 
of jobs, a major step toward eco-
nomic recovery. With such vision-
ary goals for the state, voters would 
be unwise to reject the measure. 
Vote yes on Proposition 1A.

WHAT IT WOULD DO: Allow the state 
to sell $9.95 billion in bonds for a 
high-speed rail, running from San 
Francisco to Los Angeles.

At first glance, Proposition 2 doesn’t even seem open for discussion; who wouldn’t 
want to protect animals from 
cruel confinement on large facto-
ry farms? But upon closer inspec-
tion, Californians must realize that 
if passed it will do more harm than 
good for state agribusiness.

Proposition 2 would add a chapter 
to the state’s Health and Safety Code 
to ban the housing of animals in a 
manner that does not allow them 

free range of movement, focusing on 
three types of caging: veal crates, sow 
gestation crates and battery cages for 
chickens. 

Although the relatively small pork 
and veal industries could adapt — as 
they have Colorado, Arizona, Oregon 
and Florida, which have passed simi-
lar measures regulating those sectors 
— to the changes, it’s California’s 
$337-million egg industry that would 
be cracked wide open if the mea-
sure is successful because the mar-
ket would adjust to the expensive 
restrictions by simply importing eggs 
from neighboring states and Mexico, 

WHAT IT WOULD DO: Starting in 2015, 
make keeping animals in areas where 
they cannot turn around, lie down, 
stand up or extend their limbs illegal.

California’s health-care system is ailing, and while what we need is to commit tremen-
dous funding and attention to all of 
our state’s hospitals, such a measure 
is not on Tuesday’s ballot. However, 
voters are able to affect just a small 
portion of the problem: children’s 
hospitals. 

Funding from Proposition 
3 would allow these hospitals to 
expand their facilities and update 

equipment, which would in turn 
help save young lives. The mea-
sure also requires hospitals seek-
ing a slice of the Proposition 3 pie 
to undergo an application review 
from state regulators, who would 
ensure that this money is only being 
spent on improvements to children’s 
health care.

Although children’s hospitals still 
have $350 million in 2004-approved 
bonds and adequate fundraising 
opportunities, these facilities are 
responsible for treating many of the 
state’s uninsured or poorly insured 
youth and because of this are in dis-
proportionate need of support. Vote 
yes on Proposition 3.

WHAT IT WOULD DO:  Authorize $980 
million in bonds for construction 
and equipment in eligible children’s 
hospitals, costing the state about $2 
billion over 30 years.

Proposition 4 supporters seek to mislead voters by framing their measure as one that would pro-
tect against child predators; it’s actually 
the same effort to hinder reproductive 
rights that Californians have already 
voted down twice.

A parental-notification require-
ment would not protect minors — it 
would put their health at risk, forcing 
those who are unwilling or unable 
to tell their parents about their preg-
nancy to resort to unsafe methods of 
termination. The majority of parents 
are already aware of their teenager’s 
pregnancy, according to a Los Angeles 
Times article. Clearly the current poli-
cy is in place to protect minors who are 

absolutely unable to tell their parents. 
Proposition 4 wouldn’t improve 

family communication in these house-
holds or protect minors who may be 
experiencing abuse. It would instead 
encourage these young women to seek 
unlicensed abortions or go the dura-
tion of their pregnancy without medi-
cal attention or support, giving birth 
alone and abandoning their baby to 
hide it from their parents.

Our state constitution should not 
be used as a tool for limiting access 
to nationally recognized liberties 
— particularly for the minors who 
are largely silenced in the political 
process — and this attempt is another 
nauseating reminder of the illusory 
conduct still championed by conser-
vative extremists. 

California voters need to stand up, 
as they have in the past, and protect the 
state’s minors against this dangerous 
measure. Vote no on Proposition 4.

WHAT IT WOULD DO: Change the state 
constitution so that a doctor would 
be required to notify a minor’s par-
ents at least 48 hours before perform-
ing an abortion. 3YES

Proposition 5, the Nonviolent Offender Rehabilitation Act, is a much-needed step toward 
reforming California’s overcrowded 
prison system. With resources at the 
state’s 33 prisons stretched thin and 
inmates stacked wall to wall, it makes 

no sense to continue incarcerating 
nonviolent offenders who would ben-
efit more from rehabilitation and drug 
education than from simply being 
locked up.

Additionally, the measure’s provi-
sion for the creation of drug treatment 
programs for at-risk minors is exactly 
the type of progressive action that will 
provide tangible, long-lasting solutions 
to the drug problems that affect our 
youth, rather than attempting to mere-
ly obscure these pressing issues with 
fines and imprisonment. 

The benefits of pursuing the expan-
sion of treatment over incarceration 
when dealing with drug offenses have 
been proven. When Proposition 36 
passed in 2000, it provided California 

WHAT IT WOULD DO: Allocate $460,000 
annually to the improvement and fur-
ther development of criminal treatment 
programs for those convicted of drug 
and parole-related offenses. The mea-
sure would lessen the severity of pun-
ishments for those convicted of minor 
drug and parole violation offenses, 
while creating new drug education pro-
grams for offending minors deemed at 
risk for future drug-related crimes.

Opposed by power compa-nies and renewable energy firms alike, in addition to 
influential labor, environmental and 
consumer groups, this measure has 
ignited protest from almost every 
group likely to be affected by the new 
regulations that it would impose. 
While enacting what appears to be 
an environmentally positive set of 

regulations for California’s energy 
production, Proposition 7 in fact 

enforces unrealistic standards that 
would ultimately prove detrimen-
tal to the well-being of the state’s 

WHAT IT WOULD DO: Require all utili-
ties, including those operated by the 
state government, to generate 20 per-
cent of their power from renewable 
resources by 2010, a standard which 
would increase to 40 percent by 2020 
and 50 percent by 2025. 

courts with the option of placing drug 
offenders on probation while requiring 
them to participate in rehabilitation 
programs. Since then, the treatment 
programs associated with Proposition 
36 have turned out over 84,000 
reformed offenders, individuals who 
were given the opportunity reassert 
themselves as law-abiding, tax-paying 
citizens. 

Excessive incarceration practices 
have left our state’s prisons in a pre-
dicament that only threatens to grow 
worse unless an acceptable alternative 
is agreed upon. Proposition 5 is a prag-
matic and forward-thinking approach 
to both solving California’s prison-
crowding dilemma and to addressing 
the issue of substance abuse among 
minors and adults. 

Vote to create a new set of standards 
by which to determine the sentencing 
of nonviolent offenders, standards that 
will allow the state to assist these indi-
viduals on the path to recovery. Vote 
yes on Proposition 5.

Similar to Proposition 4, Proposition 8 attempts to use our state constitution as a meth-
od for denying rights. As Californians, 
we need to come together to ensure 
equality for all — and this Tuesday, that 
means marriage equality. Although 
Proposition 8 supporters claim the 
measure protects families, saying that 
if it doesn’t pass, gay marriage will be 
taught in elementary schools — this 
could not be further from the truth. 
Marriage rights have nothing to do 
with schools, and California State 
Superintendent of Public Instruction 
Jack O’Connell has denounced the 
measure’s misleading advertisements. 

Proposition 8’s backward ideas 

limit homosexual, monogamous 
adults from enjoying the same 
rights as their heterosexual peers. 
Supporters argue that gays are 
already allowed civil unions, which 
grant them many of the same priv-
ileges of marriage. They say that 
marriage has always been between a 
man and a woman, and therefore it 
should stay that way. But until 1865 
blacks were always regarded as prop-
erty, kept as slaves because of their 
skin color. Until 1920 women were 
always excluded from the political 
process, denied the right to vote. 
Separate but equal does not work. 
America is plagued by a history of 
irrational prejudice, but we also have 
a history of taking great strides to 
overcome this prejudice. Now we 
have the opportunity to open the 
path for one more great stride. Vote 
no on Proposition 8.

WHAT IT WOULD DO: Change the state 
constitution to recognize marriage as 
strictly between a man and a woman, 
banning same-sex marriage.

8NO PROPOSITIONONenergy providers.Proposition 7 seeks to enforce 
its suggested regulations upon all 
California energy producers. That 
means that small energy compa-
nies would be subject to the same 
stringent policies as larger firms, 
thus placing a crippling financial 
burden on the state’s small wind 
and solar energy producers, effec-
tively limiting competition while 
driving business and jobs out of 
California. 

Additionally, the measure pro-
vides for no cap on electric bills, 
meaning that as power providers look 
for ways to fund the changes required 
under this measure, they have the 
option of digging into the pockets of 
California’s consumers. 

Join California’s leading energy 
producers, environmental activists, 
labor groups and consumer interest 
groups in opposing this risky mea-
sure. Vote no on Proposition 7. 

Prop 7 in fact enforces 
unrealistic standards 
that would ultimately 
prove detrimental to  
... energy providers.

As a quick run-through of our country’s self-destruc-tive history in law enforce-
ment could easily inform us, cuff-
ing every last petty criminal with 
a 10-sack doesn’t exactly kill the 

problem at its roots; instead, police-
force and prison bills skyrocket 
while the moneymakers at the top of 
the crime circuit continue to roam 
free. Proposition 6 belligerently and 
haphazardly pushes for “safer neigh-
borhoods” by calling for stricter 
penalties on small-time, street-level 
crime like gang activity, drug use, 
the bearing of arms and auto theft. 
The measure doesn’t well mask its 
mission to lock up the little (and

California criminal law.



6  OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 2008

The only thing more heart-less than joining the opposi-tion ranks for Proposition 
3 (among all others who hate sick 
children) is frowning upon an ini-
tiative to help thousands more of 
our nation’s heroes out of their card-
board boxes — the least they deserve 
after carrying out all Washington’s 
overseas dirty work. Proposition 12 

may call for some hefty cash in an 
obvious drought, but if we want to 
keep filling out the Army barracks, 
we have no choice but to supply 
those retreating from the front lines 
(or training camp, for that matter) 
with space to carry on. 

So far, taxpayers haven’t been 
charged many a penny for the pro-
ceeding veteran-home-assistance 
bonds, and if desperate times do call 
for some citizen assistance for the 
new bonds, a few extra dollars from 
our happy homes will be a small 
price to pay for those who have more 
than earned their own. Vote yes on 
Proposition 12.

What is law school?
       A place where convention is reinforced?

Or more than that?
      A place to learn a broad repertoire of skills.
    A rigorous curriculum in a supportive environment.
       An intersection of theory and practice.

Explore the wide scope of the law 
             in a school devoted to the big picture.

Although paraded under the banner of the expansion of victims’ rights, Proposition 
9 is little more than a misguided 
attempt to increase the stringency 
of California’s already strict parole 
process. 

Supporters of the measure have 
exploited the emotional concern of 
voters for crime victims, courting fear 
in an attempt to create a state consti-

tutional amendment that would only 
serve to undo any progress toward 
relieving California’s overcrowded 
prisons. 

If passed, Proposition 9 would 
cost California millions as prisoners 
formerly qualified for early release 
on parole suddenly lose this right, 
forcing the state’s prisons to house 
inmates for longer than courts now 
deem necessary. 

Victims of crimes are already 
adequately protected under state 
law. 

Vote to oppose a measure that 
would enforce additional, unneces-
sary restrictions on prisoners’ rights 
while placing an even greater strain 
on California’s prisons. Vote no on 
Proposition 9. 

WHAT IT WOULD DO: Allow for victim 
input during certain phases of crimi-
nal prosecution and charging and 
reduce the number of parole hearings 
offered to prisoners, while enforcing 
mandatory restitution regulations for 
cases in which victims experience 
material loss. S imply put, Proposition 10 is a ridiculous scheme that is being advertised by propo-

nents as an effort to benefit the 
environment.

Backed by Clean Energy Fuels 
Corp. — the natural-gas compa-
ny of billionaire Texas oil baron 
T. Boone Pickens — the measure 
would shell out taxpayer money 
largely in the form of rebates to 
boost the alternative-fuel vehicle 
market, focusing on hydrogen, 

WHAT IT WOULD DO: Allow the state 
to sell $5 billion in bonds to spend on 
programs supporting alternative fuels 
and renewable energy. The major-
ity of the money would be spent on 
rebate programs.

Voters hold an obligation to more heavily scrutinize any initiative that would go so 
far as to amend the state constitution 
— after all, those largely permanent 
standards have made up the DNA of 
California since its creation. But this 
necessary conservatism to such grave 
change shouldn’t blind us to perfect-
ing our genetic makeup where there 
exists even a minor chance for it to 
more justly represent us. 

Proposition 11’s aspiration to shift 
districting power from those it would 
strategically serve to a board of even-
ly distributed party representatives is 

an opportunity to iron a bureaucratic 
wrinkle with a long history of per-
sonal interests.

Instead of leaving historically 
utilized room for gerrymandering 
— or the budging of district lines to 
improve one party or politician’s like-
lihood of election — the new system 
would level the playing field, place a 
much-needed check on self-interest-
ed legislators and possibly even stir a 
little bipartisanship into a legislature 
of stubborn purists.

Just like with any group of humans, 
no commission could be perfect, but 
a complex selection process from a 
pool of 60 registered voters would 
bring us the closest possible to a fair 
14 — and even with their inevitable 
Democratic or Republican interests 
in mind, equality in numbers will 
prevent anything but an eventual 
compromise. 

And really, anything is better 
than letting a politician choose his 
or her own demographic. Vote yes on 
Proposition 11.

WHAT IT WOULD DO: Amend the 
California constitution to re-assign 
the geographic boundary-drawing of 
the state’s 120 legislative districts and 
four Board of Equalization districts 
— currently a task undertaken once 
every 10 years by the state legisla-
ture — to a 14-member commission 
consisting of five Democrats, five 
Republicans and four independents.

WHAT IT WOULD DO: Like 26 mea-
sures before it, Proposition 12 would 
issue bonds to assist war veterans in 
becoming homeowners through the 
CalVet HomeLoan program — this 
time, $900 million worth.

electric and natural-gas engines. 
The catch? The rebates are struc-

tured so that most would go to subsi-
dizing natural-gas-powered vehicles, 
thus building a customer base for 
Pickens’ business. Furthermore, the 
measure stipulates that in order for 
alternative-fuel vehicles to qualify 
for rebates, they must be only “as 
clean” as gasoline-powered vehicles, 
an obvious slap in the face to anyone 
who really supports the environment, 
courtesy of California taxpayers.

The only green part of this initia-
tive is the money that will be flowing 
into Pickens’ company. Vote no on 
Proposition 10.

colored) guys, targeting California’s 
most underprivileged by increasing 
punishment for minors, eliminating 
bail for illegal aliens and requiring 
criminal background checks from 
those in subsidized housing.

Instead of pouring money into 
stricter punishment, which has a 
ridiculously poor record of making 
anyone change their ways — a more 
common reaction is a teardrop tat-
too and renewed hatred for the po’ 
— our money would be far more 
productively spent on improving 
living conditions and rehabilitation 
resources in areas of high crime (not 
to mention health care and educa-
tion, if we’re really talking shop 
here). 

Handing out wads of cash and 
responsibility to state cops is a shal-
low and shortsighted solution to the 
viscous cycle that pushes so many 
inner-city youth to the wrong side of 
the law. Vote no on Proposition 6.

Before the San Diego City Council enacted a sweep-ing one-year trial ban, San 
Diegans had long enjoyed the free-
dom to drink alcohol in public 
parks and at city beaches. Although 
the ban was enacted as a response to 
a few high-profile instances of beach 
rowdiness that forced police officers 
to step in and regulate, council-
members promised that the issue 
would be re-examined after the trial

indeed a factor that led to safer 
public areas.

Now that the issue is in the hands

overturned, because a few isolated 
brawls are not reason enough to 
deny the vast majority of law-abid-
ing citizens the ability to have a few 
beers at the beach on a Saturday 
afternoon.

An all-or-nothing ban is not the 
answer; instead, the city council 
should consider harsher penalties for 
alcohol-related public disturbances 
and ban binge-drinking tools such 
as kegs, ice luges, funnels and beer-
pong tables. 

They could even restrict overnight 
and holiday drinking. That way, the 
potential for alcohol-related distur-
bances is kept in check and citizens 
can still have a glass of wine at sunset 
— everyone wins. 

Please, preserve San Diego tradi-
tion. Vote no on Proposition D.

WHAT WOULD IT DO? Make alcohol 
consumption illegal at city beaches, 
Mission Bay Park and coastal parks.

▶ The cost of construction in Francs of the 
Basilique Du Sacre-Coeur, “the Church of the 

Sacred Heart,” in Paris.

40,000,000

Chancellor of Student Affairs Cynthia 
Davalos met regularly with the city reg-
istrar to analyze the problems with on-
campus voting in 2004 — particularly, 
three- to four-hour lines — before decid-
ing to place a polling location at each 
individual college, and properly placing 
each of them.

“Even just a few weeks ago, they were 
about to take out Muir as a polling place, 
but Muir and Price Center have histori-
cally been UCSD’s main polling locations 
so we fought against it and succeeded,” 
Chen said. 

Available to man the on-campus poll-
ing places will be 43 poll workers from the 
county registrar’s office. 

Once the hectic day of polling is com-
plete, big-screen TVs, food, nonalcohol-
ic drinks and political commentary from 
leading political scientists at UCSD will 
ensue. The free nonpartisan event will 
occur from 7:15 p.m. to 9:30 p.m., wel-
coming everybody in the UCSD com-
munity, and anyone else who feels like 
showing up regardless of their political 
affiliation.

“Planning has been under way for 
over three weeks, and the crowd could 
be overwhelming,” said Barry Jagoda, 
director of communications at the Office 
of the University Communications and 
Public Affairs. 

According to Jagoda, while it takes 
leadership and a high level of efficient 
teamwork to organize such an event — a 
great part of which was facilitated by pro-
fessor Thad Kousser and International 
House — the excitement surrounding the 
election makes it worth the effort. 

“The most expensive thing is a piece of 
pie and a large-screen TV,” Jagoda said. “All 
of the organizations have put up a little bit 

of money. It’s a small amount of money for a 
great educational and fun evening.” 

To spread word of the event, a large 
number of printed flyers were distributed, 
students were sent electronic flyers on their 
school e-mail accounts and information was 
circulated among relevant disciplines, such 
as political science.

A.S. sent notifications to all UCSD stu-
dents, asked all resident advisors to inform 
their residents of polling locations, and 
plastered information all over TritonLink. 
According to Chen, these methods have 

seen huge success. 
A.S. councilmembers have also expressed 

concern that commuter students recognize 
their vote will not be recorded the day of 
the election if they cast their vote at Price 
Center. 

“Though students registered off cam-
pus can technically vote in Price Center 
since it is the official provisional polling 
location, we’re strongly encouraging as 
many off campus students as possible to 
vote before coming to campus,” Chen said. 
“Provisional ballots only get counted two to 

three weeks later, and it’s best that their votes 
get counted on the same day.” 

In order to further streamline the voting 
process, the council plans to provide a vari-
ety of new conveniences.

“The biggest thing is that so many people 
haven’t looked at the propositions, so we 
have these really easy voter guides, which 
are a poster of all the propositions, in hopes 
that students can make their decisions before 
they go to the polling locations,” she said. 
These proposition guides have been passed 
out to resident deans and student organiza-

POLLING  LINE

A cold sweat on the back of my neck left me wondering how I was coerced into climbing over 
200 steps to see another church with 
another story, one that read similar to 
hundreds of others: under construc-
tion atop the highest point in Paris 
from 1875 until 1914, Basilique du 
Sacré-Coeur, “Church of the Sacred 
Heart,” was created 
as a symbol of atone-
ment and martyr-
dom for the losses of 
the Franco-Prussian 
War. On the grassy 
hill, the white stones 
of the gothic, domed 
church float above the backdrop of the 
bustling city. 

It was during my first few days in 
this madhouse metropolis that I felt 
helpless. I had been on the verge of 
tears the moment I arrived at the air-
port without anyone to greet me.

Without friends or family, any 
French language skills or a place to 
abandon my 100 pounds of luggage, 
much less a place to sleep that evening, 
I panicked. My accommodations for the 
year evaporated, leaving me homeless. I 
navigated the metro and called a hostel 
with the few words of French I learned 
on the plane. 

I’m not proud to report my naive-
te as I frantically e-mailed my hous-

ing contact, a presumed French stu-
dent similar to myself, who stopped 
responding. Not only did I lose the 
peace of mind of having a place to live 
in Paris, but I also lost a $1,000 deposit 
through a Craigslist merchant who 
stole and manipulated a young French 
woman’s passport and identity. Sitting 
in the police station on my third day 

abroad, as an 
officer and his 
buddy looked 
apologetically 
down on me, 
homelessness 
never seemed 
more of a real-

ity. 
My unfortunate circumstance chal-

lenged me to befriend strangers. In a 
matter of hours, I added a 25-year-old 
Canadian woman and a 40-year-old 
American expatriate to the list of peo-
ple I trusted in Paris for advice, along 
with an older Mexican gentleman I 
had accidentally followed to the Notre 
Dame. When I recounted my day, my 
mother was less than pleased. 

On my fourth day abroad I took 
shelter from the rain under the shin-
gles of the only open business — an 
Asian cuisine market with a narrow 
door as the storefront — and frantically 
searched through my phone for the 
next landlord’s number. Three days of 

wandering the streets of Paris looking 
for housing with Emily, my soon-to-
be roommate and Kipp, the host of 
the floor I’d been sleeping on, had left 
me frazzled and tested my waning 
optimism. After calling 10 numbers 
(all wrong) and apologizing in poor 
French, I resigned myself to giving 
up and going home, or rather, Kipp’s 
home.

I never felt sheltered at UCSD. 
Moving away from home seemed like a 
big step toward independence — never 
mind that I never saw a single bill and 
ate at a dining hall. Living on campus 
with the comforting sameness of each 
quarter, I acquired a sense of certainty 
about who I was. I gave up exploring 
the various versions of myself. I became 
stuck as the thoughtful and reserved 
girlfriend, the reliable club member 
and the rational-thinking roommate, 
among other things. I embraced my 
talents and shortcomings with mild 
enthusiasm. It never occurred to me 
that I was settling. I never imagined 
that maybe I decided too logically who 
to be too early. 

Waking up from an anxiety-
ridden sleep on a hardwood floor, 
I faced another day of apartment 
hunting in Paris. Emily and I had 
been waiting to see a particular flat PHOTO COURTESY OF ROCHELLE EMERT

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN FOCUS  11

T he 1950s are only a 15-minute drive from campus. Studio Diner, located on Ruffin Road in Kearny Mesa, is a 
gleaming, kitschy neon eatery you can’t 
miss along a street of muted office build-
ings. As if its giant aluminum presence 
weren’t enough to attract the curious 
passersby, the diner is situated on the lot 
of San Diego’s only television and film 
company, Stu Segall Productions — a 
20-acre sprawl where gems like “Veronica 
Mars” have been captured.

Once through the chrome doors, hun-
gry diners are all taken back to a time 
when we were as American as apple pie. 
We have the option of grabbing a quick 
bite to eat at the lunch counter, where we 
can interact with waiters and cooks, or, 
patrons can sink into comfy booths whose 
dim lighting and maple paneling create a 
retro-glamour dining experience. 

While Studio Diner has all of the 
flashy throw back appeal, it has none of 
that Hollywood ’tude — waitresses are all 
smiles, and plates hit the table in a jiffy. 
The restaurant also maintains a home-
town ease through events like annual chili 
cook-offs. 

Many period-themed restaurants 
invest so much effort in decorating and 
devising clever dish names that they 
neglect the quality of their cuisine — 
this is fortunately not the case with 

Studio Diner. Yes, 
there’s a cute 
menu — the 
salad section is 
called “Mom 

Said, ‘Eat Your Greens’” and the desserts 
fall under “Go Ahead...Bake My Day” 
— but the food is in no way overshad-
owed by its cutesy labels.  

Studio Diner specializes in old-fash-
ioned comfort that will surely stick to 
your ribs — including classic favorites 
like Monte Cristo sandwiches, Sloppy 
Joes and grilled pastrami reubens. The 
diner not only transcends time but also 
coast, offering East Coast favorites like 
New England clam chowder, lobster rolls 
and authentic Ipswich clams flown in 
from Massachusetts. For ambitious eaters, 
nostalgic desserts like Black Cows, peach 
cobbler and mountainous banana splits 
feed four to six people that could easily 
leave satisfied.

Portions and qual-
ity are reflected in 
Studio Diner’s 

prices: appetizers go for at least $8 and 
the cheapest malts and shakes will run at 
about $6. For those who decide to indulge 
in a rare and steamy plate of fried Ipswich 
clams, be prepared to pay nearly $20. Also, 
because lunch time offers the most appeal-
ing items on the menu, the restaurant’s 
Web site warns patrons to avoid the 
lunch rush on Fridays, Saturdays, and 
Sundays and that the diner accom-
modates group functions of 50 at all 
times except these. 

For a wholesome and hearty 
throw back meal, Studio Diner, 
open 24 hours, packs just the 
right blast from the past.

The application process is even simpler now

that Michigan has switched to the online Pharmacy

College Application Service (PharmCAS).

in the cobbled-street neighborhood 
of Montmartre, where bakeries and 
cheese shops line the streets and 
rotisserie chicken tempt passersby on 
the sidewalk. We had waited four 
days — days that felt like they ripped 
years off of my life. Another couple 
beat us to the apartment’s first show-
ing, but we decided that if we liked it, 
we’d take it immediately. We signed 
the lease within the hour and moved 
in that evening. That night, we tri-
umphantly devoured one of those 
rotisserie chickens right down to the 
bone. 

Exactly a week after arriving in 
Paris and the day after I settled into my 
new home, I saw the Paris skyline for 
the first time from the top of the mod-
ern art museum, Musee Pompidou. 
As I posed for a photo with the Sacre 
Coeur in the background, I had not 
thought that this church would play 
any significant role in my present life. 

A short walk from my new front 
door, the entrance to the Sacre Coeur 
invites visitors to climb its 200 stairs to 
the base of the church — presumably 
one of the best views of Paris. I hate 
stairs. My issue stems from the idea that 
with practice, things should become 
easier. Climbing more than 700 steps up 
the Eiffel Tower and subsequent basili-

cas throughout Europe two summers 
ago, however, did not make climbing 
to the eighth floor of Hopkins Parking 
Structure any easier. I struggled up the 
stairs to the Sacre Coeur a few days after 
I first saw and posed with it for a photo.  
Each new set of stairs posed another 
challenge. My thighs started to burn as 
I reached the top.

Speechless, I stared at downtown 
Paris. This was my home. All I could 
say to Emily’s proud expression was, 
“I actually live here?” My memories of 
the difficult climb, to this point, had 
disappeared. Calmness finally set in 
and filled every pore recently vacated 
by the anxiety of struggling to find a 
Paris home. I became indebted to the 
stairs that tortured me a moment earli-
er. They brought me to the Sacre Coeur, 
a higher place that revealed Paris and 
a score of opportunities for adventure 
and self-invention. 

I now picnic at the Sacre Coeur, 
smothering my baguette with gooey 
cheese and sweet jam, with friends

Chen added that students need 

to be aware that they can’t wear any 
political attire into the polling site, as 
it’s considered campaigning. 

“They’ll make you turn your shirt 
inside out once you get into the poll-
ing locations,” she said. 

Meanwhile, student organizations 
such as Students for Barack Obama 
will make their presence known on 
Library Walk directing students to 
their proper voting locations since 
— according to chapter coordina-
tor Apratim Ghosh — they agree 
that voting provisionally should be 
avoided. 

The UCSD College Republicans 
declined to comment on their 
Election Day activities.

On the night of Nov. 4, sev-
eral political discussions by leading 
political scientists at UCSD will be 
at the heart of the party, including a 
panel with Kousser, who specializes 
in legislatures, legislative elections 
and California politics. Other panel-
ists will include James Fowler and 
Sebastian Saiegh.

“I’m going to be talking about 
what to look for in the battleground 
states, Fowler will be discussing his 
much-publicized research about the 
Colbert-bump and how Democratic 
candidates receive fundraising 
boosts after appearing on [The 

Colbert Report] and Saiegh will give 
an international perspective since 
this is an event working together 
with I-House,” said Kousser, the fac-
ulty coordinator of the event. 

A precursor to this large-scale 
event was held for the 2006 midterm 
election, which nearly 250 students 
attended. 

This year, the coordinators and 
sponsors, including the Council of 
Provosts, comprised of all six UCSD 
college provosts; the Department 
of Political Science; International 
House; the Office of University of 
Communications and Public Affairs, 
say they can’t know for sure how 
many will attend, but are anticipat-
ing record turnout and are making 
sure they’re ready for it.

“There hasn’t been this kind of 
energy around a presidential elec-
tion since my freshman year in col-
lege when Bill Clinton was elected, 
and even that was nothing compared 
to this,” Kousser said. “When I talk 
to my students, all 175 of them say 
without hesitation that they’re regis-
tered and ready to vote, and all signs 
point to record youth turnout in this 
election.” 

Aside for preparing for massive 
attendance, the I-House staff will 
be helping out a great deal with 
preparations, along with two UCSD 
service-based fraternities. 

A student panel, including A.S. 

President Donna Bean, will be 
discussing how students can get 
involved in politics. 

Through live remote iChat, par-
ticipants will be able to talk with 
Alec Weisman, who works on repub-
lican campaigns and is the social 
coordinator for the UCSD College 
Republicans. 

There will also be a question-
answer session from St. Louis, 
Missouri, with Dan Palay, a recent 
UCSD alum and current Obama 
staff member. 

The Office of the University 
of Communications and Public 
Affairs, a co-sponsor of the event, 
said they do this because they want 
to involve the media so that people 
in San Diego know that there are 
students engaged in voting and the 
elections.

“Radio, television and printed 
media all want the experts’ help in 
understanding what’s happening on 
election night, so they’ll be coming 
over to the event too,” Jagoda said. 

As Kousser put it, “This is a his-
toric election and your grandkids 
are going to ask you where you were 
when the first woman was elected, 
or the first African American, and 
we want to make sure everyone has 
a good answer for it.”

MEN’S GOLF — The Tritons con-
cluded their fall schedule with a sev-
enth-place finish at the Dennis Rose 
Intercollegiate in Hawaii on the Mauna 
Lani North Course on Oct. 27 and 28.

Sophomore Keith Okasaki led the 
Tritons, shooting 71-72-70 to card a 
three-under par 213 to tie for 11th 
place overall. Okasaki was followed 
by junior transfer Raj Samra, who fin-
ished in a tie for 21st, four strokes 
behind Okasaki. 

St. Edwards University overcame a 
four-stroke deficit to defeat Valdosta 
State University in a playoff. Both 
teams finished 16 strokes better than 
UCSD’s 872. While the stroke differ-
ence may seem large, head coach Mike 
Wydra described just how misleading 
it is.

“Think of it this way,” he said. “One 
stroke per round per counting player is 
a 12-stroke difference. The difference 
between a seventh-place finish and a 
third-place finish is very, very small.”

Wydra said it was no surprise that 
St. Edwards and Valdosta State were 
battling for the championship because 
of their familiarity with the Bermuda 
greens.

MEN’S WATER POLO — After fall-
ing to ranked opponents on the road 
in one-goal games, the No. 8 UCSD 
men’s water polo team returned home 
and crushed two Western Water Polo 
Association opponents in a double-
header on Nov. 2. The squad took 
care of business against UC Santa 
Cruz, dealing the Banana Slugs a 19-8 
beating in the morning before posting 
a 13-6 victory over Pomona-Pitzer 
College. 

“We were trying accomplish two 
big wins against teams that aren’t at 
our level to prove that we are the bet-
ter team,” senior utility A.J. Kotanjian 
said.

UCSD asserted its superiority over 
Pomona-Pitzer College early in the 
game, scoring seven goals during the 
first quarter. The Sagehens were able 
to answer back in the second quar-
ter, outscoring the Tritons 3-1 in the 
period to cut UCSD’s lead to 8-3 at 
halftime.

Even though the game was not 
close in the second half, tempers 
flared on both sides because of the 
whistle-happy referees, who were 
eager to charge ejections to Tritons 
and Sagehens alike. Still, UCSD held 
on to a commanding lead for the 
entire game, eventually netting the 
13-6 victory.

In the first game of the day, the 
Banana Slugs had few answers to 
the Triton attack, falling behind 12-3 
after the first two quarters. Because of 
their dominant first half, the Tritons 
were able to give a lot of minutes 
to nonstarters in the second half of 
the game. Junior goalkeeper Daniel 
Ramirez minded the net for the entire 
second half, relieving freshman goal-
keeper David Morton. Junior driver 
Kneif Lohse and freshman driver 
Graham Saber stood out for UCSD, 
scoring the Tritons’ last two goals of 
the game.

“It was good for them to be able 
to get some more game experience,” 
Kotanjian said of the players off the 
Triton bench. “They held their own.”

With the Tritons having a real 
chance at the conference crown, the 
wins over WWPA opponents were 
crucial because the seeding for the 
conference championships will decide 
who the Tritons will have to battle 
before they can reach the champi-
onship game. The two wins boost 
UCSD’s WWPA record to 4-3 and 
overall record to 16-9. 

“There are a number of things we 

are working on in our push to confer-
ence,” head coach Denny Harper said. 
“Pomona and Santa Cruz represent 
the bottom half of our conference and 
while we are not trying to annihilate 
teams, we can’t sacrifice where we 
want to go.”

Junior two-meter Daniel Garcia 
had a team-high nine goals on the 
day while senior driver Jeff Hunt and 
Kotanjian added four apiece.

ence schedule next weekend on the

CLUB SPORTS — The bloody pre-
season matchup between the UCSD 
and UC Irvine’s men’s rugby teams 
could best be summed up as a seesaw. 
UCSD carried a convincing lead for a 
solid chunk of the game, which took 
place Saturday at Warren Field, but 
the Tritons’ flat start ended up bene-
fiting UC Irvine. Each team answered 
the other squad’s scores with try after 
try, but with the Anteaters squashing 
many of UCSD’s scoring opportu-
nities, UC Irvine ended up on top 
27-22.

UCSD came out slow in the first 
period, while UC Irvine scored a try 
along with a conversion kick worth 
two points, making the score 7-0. In 
the second period, the UCSD offense 
came back with a try of its own on a 
drive finished by freshman back Billy 
Blanchard in the game’s 34th minute. 
UC Irvine then followed with anoth-
er try, but UCSD came storming back 
with a few scores.

Most of UCSD’s tries came late in 
the game, in a string of three, with 
forward Steve Schmidt leading the 
way in the 70th minute, senior back 
Jake Hoffman in the 78th and fresh-
man back Quintin Dolci in the 80th. 
Senior Will Cowell added a few solid 
conversion kicks in a game where 
they were hard to come by.

WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL — After 
winning a five-set thriller Friday 
night against No. 20 Cal Poly 
Pomona, the No. 15 UCSD women’s 
volleyball team fell to No. 2 Cal 
State San Bernardino on Saturday 
night in straight sets 27-25, 25-13, 
25-16. 

In their previous encounter on 
Sept. 26, the Tritons toppled the 
then-No. 1 Cal State San Bernardino 
Coyotes (21-3, 13-3 California 
Collegiate Athletic Association) in 
five games. Going into Saturday 
night, the UCSD team was excited 
to play its conference rival, espe-
cially after the exhilarating win the 
previous night. 

In the opening set, both squads 
battled to take control, with neither 
team gaining any momentum. In a 
set that featured 14 ties and 10 lead 
changes, the Tritons held a 24-22 
advantage late in the game, but the 
team struggled to capitalize with 
a service error and an attack error 
on the next two points. A kill by 
senior outside hitter Rebecca Bailey 
put UCSD ahead 25-24, but the 
Coyotes capitalized on the Tritons’ 
mistakes with three straight kills to 
take the set. 

The second game began exactly 
like the opening set — in an almost 
dead heat — with five ties before 
the score reached 7-7. However, 
the tide began to change following 
a Cal State San Bernardino timeout 

with the score 11-10. After both 
teams rallied for a point each, the 
Coyotes went on a 9-0 run, taking 
advantage of Triton errors to easily 
win the set.

In the conclusive third game, Cal 
State San Bernardino jumped out to 
an early lead, taking advantage of 
the momentum built up from the 
previous set. The Tritons weren’t 
able to get back into the game, and 
the Coyotes continued to punish 
UCSD for its errors. Cal State San 
Bernardino hit a .560 clip compared 
to the Tritons’ .172 percentage. In 
defeat, Bailey led UCSD with 15 
kills and redshirt freshman defen-
sive specialist Roxanne Brunsting 
had a team-high eight digs. Senior 
outside hitter Kimberly Carpenter 
described how the team just seemed 
to be a bit off of its norm.  

“We had an off night and 
just weren’t clicking as a team,” 
Carpenter said. “Our serving is usu-
ally a strong point and it wasn’t 
really connecting.”

Friday night’s match against No. 
20 Cal Poly Pomona (15-6, 12-4 
CCAA) was a hard-fought clash for 
the Tritons. The Broncos were com-
ing off a victory against No. 2 Cal 
State San Bernardino the previous 
Wednesday night and held a perfect 
7-0 home record. 

Despite UCSD holding an early 
advantage, Cal Poly Pomona took 
the first set. The Tritons led 14-6 
after kills by Bailey and junior set-
ter Elaine Chen before the Broncos 
rallied to tie the score at 19. Despite 
kills from Bailey and junior out-
side hitter Sylvia Schmidt to level 
the score late in the game, Cal 
Poly Pomona came through with 
the win.

“We play on bent-grass greens at 
home,” he said. “In a tropical place like 
[Hawaii] or the Sun Belt, the grain of 
the Bermuda grass is important and the 
greens are a little slower. St. Edwards 
and Valdosta State regularly play on 
those types of greens and getting used 
to that condition is easier for teams that 
play on those types of greens.”

Despite the customary practice 
round all teams receive prior to actual 
play, the Triton men struggled on the 
greens early in the first round. Late in 
the round, UCSD finally began capital-
izing on opportunities and made putts 
down the stretch to post a one-over par 
289 total after the first 18 of day one’s 
grueling 36 holes.

In the second round, Okasaki got 
off to a hot start going to four-under 
par after five holes. He gave himself 
multiple opportunities over the next 
few holes to push that number to five-
under par, but couldn’t get short putts 
to drop. 

Samra, who made a triple bogey 
with eight strokes on the par-five sev-
enth hole in the first round, played the 
same hole five strokes better, carding 
an eagle in round two on the way to his 
one-under 71.

As a team, the Tritons were nine 
under with only seven holes to go, 
but watched the putts stop falling as 
they started to pile up bogeys. UCSD 
finished the second round with a two-
over par 290.

Part of playing collegiate golf is 

dealing with that demanding 36-hole 
schedule on the first day of tournament 
play. It’s nothing new for these seasoned 
players, but for Samra it is much more 
rigorous than junior college golf.

 “It’s a much different experience,” 
he said. “Instead of having only 18 
holes, you have 54 holes to make bird-
ies to lower your score. But it’s challeng-
ing and mentally draining walking 36 
holes in one day.”

As the Kona and trade winds wors-
ened in the final round, the Tritons 
fought to a five-over 293. 

The seventh-place finish didn’t 
prevent Wydra from expecting great 
things from the team’s spring-season 
opener.

“Our future is so bright we need 
sunglasses,” he said. “We’re averaging 
12 to 14 strokes better than last year 
and we have the potential to go even 
lower.”

With their fall schedule now com-
plete, the Tritons will be on the honors 
system, as it is up to each player to 
continue improving his game.

“It’s everyone on his own,” Okasaki 
said. “We’re going to play a few rounds 
as a team, but mainly it’s work in the 
gym and work on the game to come 
back sharp.”

UCSD returns to competition Jan. 
26 at the San Diego Intercollegiate 
Classic, where it hopes to improve 
upon last season’s last-place finish.

road against UC Davis on Nov. 7 and 
Santa Clara University on Nov. 8. The 
two matchups will undoubtedly be 
more challenging than UCSD’s games 
on Sunday.

“Those two games have large 
WWPA implications toward the seed-
ing of the tournament,” head coach 
Denny Harper said. “We played Davis 
once this season and beat them at 
home, but if you go 1-1 with a team 
the most recent game is what counts 
for seeding.”

The Tritons will face a Santa Clara 
team that holds an impressive 8-3 
WWPA record this season and is 
playing in a new pool in which UCSD 
has never competed.

“While we are excited to play in 
Santa Clara’s brand new 50-meter 
pool, this is the only time we play 

them this season so it’s an important 
game,” Harper said.

Capping off a busy weekend, 
UCSD will face No. 3 UCLA on Nov. 
9 in a nonconference game. The two 
teams faced off earlier this season in 
the Southern California Tournament 
on Oct. 11 in which the Tritons fell 
to the Bruins 12-9 after being tied at 
halftime.

“We’re going up there trying to get 
an upset,” Kotanjian said. 

The game against UCLA will be 
the last of the Tritons’ regular season. 
UCSD will face Sunset San Diego 
in an exhibition game on Nov. 15 
before heading to Claremont, Calif., 
for the WWPA Championships on 
Nov. 21-23.

tured stronger play from Bailey, 
as the senior led the way with five 
consecutive kills in the second set 
and a critical kill during the third 
set to tie the score at 23. Following 
Bailey’s lead, Schmidt hit a crucial 
kill and an ace in the third game 
and UCSD took a 2-1 advantage in 
the match.

Cal Poly Pomona came back to 
win the fourth set before senior 
outside hitter Kimberly Carpenter 
stepped up to lead the way for the 
Tritons in the fifth game. Carpenter 
recorded consecutive kills followed 
by a block assist to give UCSD a 
7-5 lead. The senior recorded three 
more kills during a Triton rally 
before Schmidt ended the match 
with a kill. 

Carpenter finished the game 
with five kills — all in the decisive 
fifth set — while Bailey totaled 23 
kills on the night. Freshman outside 
hitter Hillary Williamson continued 
her strong rookie campaign with 

seven kills and a team-high 16 digs. 
Carpenter felt excited with how well 
the team was playing together, espe-
cially during the final set.  

“We were just really clicking as 
a team,” Carpenter said.  “We were 
playing in our system and everyone 
seemed right on and doing their 
jobs.  I really felt like this was one 
of the first times during the season 
that we really put it all together and 
it was awesome.”

Following their weekend series 
split, the Tritons are 18-5 (12-4 
CCAA) and look to bounce back 
against Cal State Stanislaus on Nov. 
6 at 7 p.m. in RIMAC Arena. UCSD 
will follow that game with a match-
up against Chico State University 
on Nov. 7 at 7 p.m. In its earlier 
matches this season, the Tritons 
recorded a 3-1 win over Cal State 
Stanislaus and fell to Chico State 
3-2.

ground, as UCSD players were injured 
one after another. Even though UCSD 
was able to tough it out and keep the 
game competitive, the Tritons came 
out on the losing end.

For head coach Brian Kennody, 
preseason is a matter of the Tritons 
getting their feet wet and determining 
the players’ positions. Kennody said 
he thought both sides played a bit 
sloppy, which revealed rust and lack 
of experience. 

“A lot of new guys played and a 
lot were at new positions,” Kennody 
said. “In the fall, we have to teach and 
welcome new players, and the most 
important thing is getting these guys 
experience.” 

Kennody was optimistic about the 
upcoming season and said he is look-
ing forward to adding to the play-
book once the new players perfect the 
basics. Still, the game provided the 
Tritons with a lot of things to work on 
as the season progresses.

“We came out a little slow, but in 
the end we picked it up and put in a lot 
of tries,” junior captain Matt Ravalin 
said. “We need more energy in the for-

ward pack and were a little flat today. 
Working patterns and fluidity, and 
working power — power is key.”

There are some big tourna-
ments and matchups coming up for 
the team, highlighted by the Long 
Beach Tournament and the City 
Tournament, which includes matches 
against the University of San Diego 
and San Diego State University.

According to Schmidt, aside from 
the UC Irvine match, UCSD’s pre-
season record has been solid thus far. 
The Tritons have already defeated UC 
Riverside 67-7, Division-I University 
of San Diego, and stood victorious 
at the annual UCSD rugby alumni 
game, in which the alumni usually 
come out on top. 

Schmidt also said preseason is a 
learning process for the young guys 
— it’s a time for players become famil-
iar with certain positions. 

“Our main focus right now is 
getting players comfortable in their 
positions,” Schmidt said. “Rugby is 
a finesse game and thinking game, 
unlike football where you pop a guy 
and the play is done.”

Since the majority of college rugby 

players grew up unfamiliar to the 
sport as there are not many high 
school teams in America, the learning 
curve for new players is a little longer 
than in other sports. The team has 
many rookies who need to learn the 
basics during Fall Quarter so that, 
come crunch time in January, every-
one is ready to go and comfortable 
with their positions.

“It’s a learning process, so we have 
to keep coming out and we should 
do well,” senior back Sung Shin said. 
“We are still a young team, and we 
need to come out with more intensity. 
It’s going to take some time, but we’re 
going to get on it.” 

With increasing signs of strength 
and potential, the team is being 
patient with its newcomers. Even 
though competition has already start-
ed, the Tritons are still looking to add 
new players. 

The next UCSD rugby match will 
take place at the all-day Kings of the 
City Tournament, held on Nov. 15 at 
UCSD.
