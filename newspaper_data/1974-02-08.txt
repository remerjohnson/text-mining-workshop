"The destruction of the homes of 3000 people in the 
squatter colonia of Tierra y Libertad in Tijuana is not an 
isolated case, nor is it a dying issue. This is one step 
towards possible social revolution in Mexico." 

Less than 150 UCSD students gathered in the Revelle 
Plaza Wednesday to hear these words from a UCSD 
student acting as a spokesman for the students of the 
University of Baja California in Tijuana . The key speaker 
at the rally was Fred Cook, Third College com-
munication arts major, arrested during the military 
eviction on the morning of jan . 30. He, along with Anne 
Prutzman, also a Third College communication arts 
student, were relased Friday after 72 hours in a Tijuana 
jail. 

The student spokesman gave the following account of 
the incidents leading up to the armed eviction by 
Mexican federal troops. 

Before their eviction from the land which they had 
occupied for three months, the colonos had built up a 
small parcel of land across from the U of BC into a well-
organized community of new roads, a community 
center, a clinic and severa l schools. The population had 
grown from the original 120 families to the over 3000 
people who were there when the federal troops came 
last week. 

The original squatters were refugees from the 10,000 
people who were evicted from the Tijuana riverbed 
three months ago so that a cana l could be built for a 
giant tourist complex. The money for the construction 
of the tourist center and industrial park will come from 
federal taxes, that is, the workers' paychecks. 

A small segment of the evicted families were 
guaranteed housing by the government in an area near 
an airport . After these families had moved into new 
brick houses, they were told that they would have to 
pay $4000 for them, a price well-beyond the means of 
these common laborers. But the canal was already 
under construction at the site of their former residences, 
so they could not return there. 

It was after thiS problem that the 120 families began 
to occupy as squatters (a common form of settling in 
Mexico) a parcel of government land near the riverbed . 
They were talked into leaving this land by the govern-
ment, with the assurance that they would receive 
adequate housing at another site. When all they 
received were plywood shacks far from their jobs, they 
went to the U of Be students for help. 

Students provided them with a parcel across from the 
University. They also aided their initial efforts to begin a 
community . On Nov. 29, 1973, students held a rally in 
support of the fledgling community, Tierra y Libertad . 
The Mexican government began to realize the value of 
the land settled near the University. The spokesman also 
added that the administration was also becoming 
suspicious of the successful social organization of Tierra 
y Libertad. The squatters sensed the tension mounting 
and mobilized for their defense. In the meantime, 
government-planted provocators attempted to stir up 
dissension among residents . 

At noon on jan . 29, Tijuana police arrested several 
students and beat a crowd of onlookers. In retaliation, 
colonos took three buses, an oil truck and two taxies. 

Two policemen and a pair of reporters were held 
hostage on the condition that the colonos be allowed to 
publish a statement of their grievances. This offer was 
refused. 

That night 600 armed federal troops surrounded the 
area. At 6:30 Wednesday morning, soldie~ moved in, 
rushing residents away in trucks to be dropped on 

roadsides some distance away. Meanwhile bulldozers 
leveled their dwellings and flamethrowers set them on 
fire . Police went through belongings left in the exodus. 
20 supposed leaders of the community were arrE'sted; 
the two UCSD students were among these. 

The governor of Baja California publicly declared that 
the residents of Tierra y Libertad would not be com-
pensated for their losses. He declared that he would not 
let principles of authority be challenged, as they were at 
Tierra y Libertad . 

Troops remained in the area to prevent squatters from 
returning. Families are now scattered throughout the 
vicinity of Tijuana in search of shelter and food. 

Public response in the San Diego area was Widespread 
but not overwhelming. 

There were two demonstrations shortly after the 
eviction . One was held at the Mexican consulate 10 
downtown San Diego, the other at the International 
Border on Saturday. 

The spokesman thought out loud at this point when 
he said, "Only 15 miles away and there is hardly 
anybody here who cares for these 3000 evicted people." 

Following the spokesman's remarks, Cook told of hiS 
experience. 

What he and Prutzman were doing in Tijuana was 
part of a class project in which they were to film a 
documentary of the blossoming cooperative effort of 
this unique growing community of squatters. 

When the two entered the defense camp on the 
morning of the military intervention, they noted the 
highly organized preparations of residents against the 
troops. The "commandeered" vehicles were neatly lined 
up. Hostages were detained in the rear of one of the 
buses. Cook and Prutzman began to take pictures of the 
camp until a warning was shouted that the troops were 
closing in . 

The two students took up a position on a hillside 
above the camp, and hopefully out of danger. Cook 
expressed his surprise when the one or two soldiers 
around them became part of a large cordon of soldiers 
which had quickly , had them surrounded . They 
surrendered immediately. 

Throughout their three day incarceration in a 5x10 
foot cell with 22 other prisoners, they were unable to 
make contact with their parents or friends . Instead, they 
were rebuffed, first by a San Diego policeman and then 
by an American consul, both of whom, it appeared to 
them, did not want to jeopardize their relationships 
with the Mexican government. Three Los Angeles 
policeman interrogated them to determine if they were 
outside agitators. At the same time, their fellow 
prisoners were interrogated and beaten . The two 
students were not harmed physically with evidence 
against the 20 year-old Prutzman of previously being an 
agitator, they released them Friday night after they had 
paid a S24 fine . All charges on them were dropped. 

Cook concluded his speech with hopes that students 
here will become as active in social change as their 
Latin American counterparts have been in recent years. 

There will be a benefit dinner for the colonos of Tierra 
y Libertad at 7,30 p.m . at the Centro Cultural de la Raza, 
Balboa Park (across from the Navy hospital). 

For a dollar or more donation, the group is offering 
Mexican food and entertainment. The spokesman said 
that the money will go directly to the students at U of 
BC who are aiding displaced families . Volunteers are 
still needed for tonight's Benefit Dinner.

residents may contact the offices of the North Star

the two-fold reason of being 
a communication device 
between the community 
and the university and to 
render substantive advise 
on issues of its own 
violation and on others 
presented by the Chancellor 
including the annual 
operating budget, capital 
projects, and various policy 
issues of importance to the 
campus and community . 
McElroy stated that ITe 
expected no major direct 
effect on student activities; 
the committee might advise 
him on some academic 
policies that he would then 
"throw in a pot and let the 
faculty and students think 
about it". He also stated 
that he felt the Board was 
an ideal place for students 
to bring issues they feel are 
being misunderstood by the 
community to present an 
explanation. 

The Board will be divided 
into four subcommittees to 
discuss Educational Policy, 
Buildings and Grounds, 
Finance and Current Issues.

Running on Blubber 
The energy crisis, despite its many negative aspects, 

may be of positive value in reducing obesity problem s, 
says a University of California, San Francisco physician . 

Rudolf E. Noble, M.D., Ph .D, Clinical Instructor at 
UCSF, predicts that gasoline rationing may cause as 
much as 12 pounds per month weight loss in individuals 
who are forced to walk instead of driving autos. 

" Let us assume that an individual has been using 60 
gallons of gas per month and that he gets 15 miles per' 
gallon . Under planned government restrict ions he will 
be allowed to use only 35 gallons - 25 gallons fewer 
each month. Therefore, he may have to make up the 
monthly difference of 375 miles by his own locomotion. 

"Now, when a person walks 30 miles he loses about a 
pound of weight. Therefore, if an individual has to walk 
those 375 miles and continues to consume his normal 
daily intake of calories, he should lose about 12 pounds 
per month." 

Mayans Offer Credit 
The mysterious Mayan civilization-its art, ar-

chitecture/ history, and culture-will be examined in a 
two-week study tour of the Mexican states of Yucatan 
and Chiapas and of Guatemala. University of California 
Extension is sponsoring the course, offered March 16-31 . 

Participants in the study tour will examine the 
collections of artifacts in various private and public 
museums, including the National Museum of An-
thropology in Mexico City, as an orientation to the 
Maya prior to traveling to the ruins. 

Participants will visit some of the more significant 
Mayan structures including the Temple of the Magician, 
the Palace of the Governor, and the Great Pyramid at 
Uxmal ; EI Castillo and the Temple of the Warr iors at 
Chichen Itra; the Palace, the Temples of the Sun, the 
Cross, and the Foliated Cross at Palenque; and the six 
temple-pyramids at Tikal-the largest of all Mayan sites . 

Barbara Voorhies, professor of anthropology, UC 
Santa B3rbara, has done extensive research on pre-
Columbian civilizations and will be the instructor for 
the course. Five quarter-term units of academic cred it 
may be earned through University Extension. 

Details about fees, travel arrangements, and 
schedules may be obtained from Dept. RS, International 
Studies, University of Cal iforn ia Extension, 2223 Fulton

Ca lifornia, con .i ,wes to plague selected segments of the 
national comn,un ity. The fo llowing art icle appeared in 
the January 30 Issue of Brigham Young Universi ty's daily 
newspaper, H :e Daily Universe :

of current hai ' standard. 

The interpreo:a t ion that ha ir be styled "so that it does 
not cover the ?ars" means men's hair should not cover 
any part of the ear, according to the memo. 

Pres. Oaks also explained in his memo to the faculty 
that he had reviewed " the most persuasive student 
letters with the Executive Committee of the Board of 
Trustees on January 17, pointing out the difficulty of

On The Necessity 
Of Masturbation 

Letters to the Editor 

by Perty Byssche 
That's right, masturbation . I bet that 95 percent of 

you believe that masturbation is a highly inferior and 
somewhat childish form of sexual indulgence, and that 
if you resort to it you aren 't a re.1 man or a real woman . 

Physiologi cally speaking, an orgasm is an orgasm . If 
you never-the-Iess find masturbation unsat ~sfying and 
degrading, that's only your psychological problem. 

We should learn to respect all forms of sexuality as 
beautiful. If masturbation were accepted as a 
reasonable alternative, people would only have sex 
together if they were genuinely delighted with each 
other. There would be less domination and ego-tripping, 
and more affection based on working together for a 
common cause, sharing common interests and goals, 
del ighting in each others personalities, vitality, physical 
beauty; more concern for the whole person . 

Monogamy and possessiveness is idiotic; people are 
not so remarkably unique that there can be a rational 
justification for loving madly just one person . 

Show affection to your friends by touching and 
fondling them . Do it in the open sun of the beach or the 
plaza. Why should you keep your pleasure in a box? So 
you're afraid that someone else wi II watch? That is such 
a selfish fear . What can be finer than to provide 
amusement for others? Are you afraid to declare to the 
world that you love? Are you afraid that the sight wi II be 
offensive to others? What is more obscene than being 
offended at the sight of harmless pleasure? 

Break the psychological bonds that prevent your life 
from being as delightful as it might be . 

Break the myth that you have to have sex, and that 
this sex must be heterosexual and private, exclusive and 
possessive. 

Develop an expanded sensuality . Learn an exquisite 
gentleness. Cherish values of personal warmth, intimacy 
and contact. Be free in your expression, but never in-
sincere. 

Ethno 
methodology 
Editor : 

In making his comments 
"On Sociology at UCSD," 
David Durkin seems to have 
neglected to check a few 
facts about the Department 
of Sociology : 

1. Approximately one-
third of the faculty do most 
of their work in 
ethnomethodology. By Fall 
1974 this number should be 
reduced to approximately 
one-fourth of the faculty . 

2. I suggest that Mr. 
Durkin try some of the 
following courses that are 
being given this quarter : 
Soc . 105, Popular Culture; 
Soc. 119, Sociology of 
Poverty ; Soc . 121 , 
Sociology of Deviance, Law 
and Crime; Soc . 130, 
Sociology of Development; 
Soc. 137A, Sociology of 
Colonialism ; Soc . 138, 
Comparative Historical 
Sociology; Soc . 142, Forms 
of Social Control ; Soc. 144, 
Community and Social 
Change in Africa; Soc. 149/ 
Sociology of Religion; Soc. 
157, Culture, Science and 
Society; and Soc . 159, 
Sociology of Art . If Mr. 
Durkin would be so kind as

Gratitude 
Editor: 

On behalf of S.L.D.M ., I 
would like to express our 
gratitude to the Triton 
Times Staff for the excellent 
coverage of our voter

was a big success - so

Editor: 

H ieronymous Hoover 
really ought to re-exam ine 
what he wrote in "This 
Article Is An Abortion" and 
reflect upon the question 
he proposes. From th is pre-
med student's point of 
view: one can not use the 
words " ki ll ing" and 
"reasonable and proper" in 
the context of destroying a 
human fe t us and act 
completely indifferent to 
t he qu es t io n . Hoover 
delineates the integrity of 
the fetus in as far as a 
nervous sys t em and 
potential are concerned . 
Why not go all the way and 
condemn such a murderous 
pract ice as a blatan t 
v iolation of t hat ver y 
valuable right to life wh ich 
we all hold in such high 
esteem? Each one of us as a 
whole must move to protect 
these helpless beings from 
such a vicious slaughter and 
restore the d ignity con-
nected with the life of the 
human fetus.

Dear Mark: 

Re: the let ter appearing 
in last Friday's issue: "No 
Joke." 

In regards to Ms. Budd's 
comment that: " ... even a 

competent satirist would 
hesitate to use (hdt form to 
deal with such difficult 
topic (abortion)." it should 
be noted that Ph illip Roth 
in late 1971, published a 
satirical novel about the 
N i xon adm i n is trat io n 
entitled " Our G an g." 
Although the baSIS o f the 
novel concerned Ric hard 
Nixon, one of the primalY 
avenues of Roth's assault 
had to do wi th Nixon's 
assumed position on 
abortion 

In comparison with some 
of the comments made in 
Mr Roth's work, McCarty's 
article IS a clinical analYSIS 
by com par ison Indeed Ms 
Budd may wish to debate 
Roth's abi lity as a com-
petent sat irist, but I would 
merely like to remind her to 
check her facts before she 
makes clai ms

-T.S. Eliot 

There is an event soon to 
take place on this campus, 
an event of which people in 
the UCSD community 
should be aware, though 
few will probably have 
much direct contact with it . 
"Visuals and Voices: The 
Natural and the Syn-
thesized." is the title of a 
symposium to be con-
ducted, from Feb. 11-22, 
under the auspices of the 
Center for Music Ex-
periment (CME) . 

The CME, for those yet as 
unenlightened as I was is 
tucked away on the eastern 
fringe of Matthews Campus, 
in Building 408, and it is 
here that all the lectures 
discussions, workshops' 
seminars. and the like, of 
which the symposium is 
composed, will be given. 

One avowed purpose of 
the CME is to investigate 
"new sources of materials 
appropriate to the needs of 
musicians and to others 
engaged in performance 
art ." The emphasis falls on 
"new sources," for here 
CME is involved in ex-
ploring and challenging 
human limits and poten-
tials . This converts an 
incredibly \ broad topic -
Visuals and Voices- into a 
managealile one, namely 
the display and discussion 
of " bou ndary area" 
phenomena. 

non-lingUistic com-
munication and the limits 
of the voice, the bulk of the 
Visuals section deals with 
new video techniques . 

The character of the 
symposium is in-
terdisciplinary ; the 
backgrounds of the par-
ticipants vary tremen-
dously. Artists, linguists and 
neurosc ientists are brought 
together to maximize the 
range of experiences and 
outlooks combined to 
consider the topics 
proposed . 

Among the participants 
are Frank Gillette and Ed 
Emshwiller, known for their 
video experimentation. Mel 
Blanc, of Warner Bros . 
fame, also Ursula Bellugi-
Klima, who has been 
studying sign language at 
the Salk Institute, and 
Newton Harrison. whose 
ecological art form, a kind 
of stylized growing of 
animals, mainly sea 
animals, with emphasis on 
color and texture changes 
of the whole and individual 
parts of the ~yst4!m, 
represents a unique 
departure from the con-
ventional concepts of what 
constitutes artistic 
materials. 

Sounds fascinating, 

admittedly do not, in all 
probability, have much 
crowd appeal. Happily, 
there are within the con-
fines of the symposium 
several events upon which 
public interest and 
technical appraisal do 
converge. To these a wider 
audience is welcomed. 

This all begins at 8:30 
p.m., the first (Feb. 11) is a 
program given by the Ex-
tended Vocal Techniques 
Group of UCSD, the second 
(Feb. 12) is a concert of 
North Indian Vocal Music 
given by Pandit Pran Nath 
with Terry Riley - both also 
from UCSD, and the last 
(Feb. 22) a Demon-
stration/Improvisation of 
both visual and vocal 
techniques (Stephen Beck, 
Warren Burt, and the EVT 
Group participating). It is 
also conceivable that some 
of the video pieces - which, 
by the way. m.ay be daz-
zling. surely to be 
multimedia and/or com-
puterized - will have a 
public showing under the 
sponsorship of the Visual 
Arts Department. This was 
not confirmed.

that same fervor . 

Sandy Baron accomplished this feat. 
He knew and empathised with Lenny 
Bruce and his beliefs . He displayed much 
of the rapid -fire, satirical. emotional 
manner in which Bruce delivered his 
convictions . He made his audience feel 
his message to much the same depth that 
Bruce did . 

Ted Schwartz does a fairly good job of 
acting the role. But. in all honesty, he 
labors for laughs in many of the night-
club routines in which Baron had the 
audience rolling in the aisle. He portrays 
surface emotions during scenes in which 
the character should feel them in depth. 
And he gets highly upset at things which 
would have Bruce sobbing in frustration 
and despair. 

It also contains nudity. large amounts 
of profanity. and parodies of "sacred" 
ceremonies. In terms of presenting a play 
which merely mocks Society, these 
things need not be justified. But Lenny is 
the legacy of a man, and his thoughts 
and feelings were so much deeper than 
Society wished to give him credit for. 
Therefore the actor must justify the role 
in terms of adequately presenting the 
concept of Lenny Bruce. which is a main 
issue in the play. Ted Schwartz was not 
adequate. 

Is the production then still worth 
seeing? Of course. There are many great 
scenes which would work well no matter 
who was performing them, and this cast 
is certainly not bad, despite the weakness 
of the lead. 

It has been said that the message often 
transcends the medium. This is the case 
with Lenny. It is still a good show. 
despite its failure to compete with the 
first San Diego version . It is well worth 
the price of admiSSion, and will be 
showing nightly except Mondays until 
February 17. But. alasl , where are you

T. T. Interview 

Bright White Light 
"You have to use your 

own mind or you're not 
justifying your own 
existence." -Shawn Phillips 

Shawn was in town last 
Friday at the Sports Arena. 
billed with the Moody 
Blues . The place was 
packed, as tickets had all 
been sold for a week, and 
the concert was excellent. 
Before Shawn opened up 
the show, we talked into a 
tape recorder for about half 
an hour. The main topic of 
discussion was the role of 
the contemporary music 
arti st as "prophet" or 
whatever. A brief synopsis 
of that conversation 
follows . 

Shawn sees himself as 
primarily a translator and 
interpreter for his audience. 
in the sense that his travels 
and wide range of ob-
servation give him a rather 
unusual perspective, which 
he then tries to pass along 
to others via his music. He 
feels that many of his fellow 
musicians are doing much 
the same. The process 
consists of the artist trying 
to be in touch with what's 
happening in Ol.(r world, 
both externally and in-
ternally (consciousness and 
awareness of the people,) 
and then distilling and 

Bob Benson 

sharing this experience. 
This has been one of the 

primary roles of the artist 
throughout history, but in 
the ever-shrinking world of 
instant long-range com-
munication and ' electronic 
mass media, with the 
correspondingly faster 
reaction times, this role 
becomes a crucial one. For 
to the extent that the artists 
fail to fill it, a vacuum 
remains which must be 
fi lied by non-artistic "in-
formation ," such as 
government or commercial 
propaganda. In fact, the 
artist is an interpreter of 
reality, more potent now 
than that classical purveyor 
of "reality," organized 
religion. The difference 
between the artist and the 
other reality-interpreters is 
that the artist never forces 
his interpretation on 
anyone. 

Shawn sees the con-
temporary artist as par-
ticipating in the raising of 
consciousness of his 
audience: "In a concert, all 
I ask is that someone go out 
feeling different than the 
way they did when they 
came in . If that happens 
with one individual, then 
I've done what I came to 
do." 

We talked about the 
actual process that may 

arrived at a description of 
it, from considering how 
different individuals 
perceive the same work of 
art. Although the same 
piece may mean different 
things to different people, 
and even to the same 
person at different times; 
the artist hopes that some 
connection is made within 
the listener. in a not-
necessari Iy-rational way . 
This can then later relate to 
other experience in the 
associative. non-sequential 
matrix of mind . This process 
may lead to the eventual 
synthesis of the now-
separate realities of peoples 
and cultures into a higher 
level of human con-
sciousness . 

"Greed for profit is now a 
substitute for the hunt. But 
the rules of the game 
haven't changed." (Yet) . 
This treatment of human 
beings as objects in a game 
is the root cause of most of 
the problems of mankind. 
especially those that are not 
amenable to primarily 
technological solutions. We 
must devote a larger share 
of our efforts to developing 
ways to better share the 
wealth of the world, 
changing the competitive 
games we play into ones 
that do not threaten or 
exploit the very existence of A perusal of the schedule

so, according to Dr . Roger 
Reynolds, of the CME. The 
symposium is as serious, as 
technical, as any medical 
specialists' might be. The 
tenre of most of the events 
will be cerebral, erndite, 
and they are, it is felt, 
generally unfit for public 
consumption. Titles such as 
"The Artificial Larynx as a 
Vocal Tract Stimulant" 

SCUBA LESSONS 

At present time, the CME 
has no plans to bring back, 
for more general programs 
any of the artists or 
speakers from the sym-
posium, which this writer 
finds unfortunate. Without 
getting into the sticky 
debate of artist's relation to 
public, or vice versa, I say 
wistfully that it would be 
nice to hear a bit more 
often from those at the 
front of artistic exploration, 
for words, imprecise as they 
may be, still have the power 
to excite minds and 
stimulate fresh thought.'

Coed Cage Slats 
C<H!d basketball appears 

to have become the most 
entertaining, if not the most 
popular of the winter 
quarter's intramural sports. 
Composed of three women 
and two men, each team 
must rely heavily on its 
often-inexperienced female 
talent. 

As is usually true, the co-
ed rules were structured 
with the idea in mind that 
women should be as im-
portant to the outcome of 
the game as men. 

Resultantly, baskets (free-
throws excepted) count 
three points for 'M>men and 
one for men. Thus the 
emergence of many 
promising female sharp 
shooters. 

I n the San Onofre 
League, the leading teams 
are Hepburn's Hopefuls and 
the Starz, with two wins 
each. Confusion due to The 
Great Flood caused the 
league to suffer a few early 

Sports This Week

Students Seek Credits 
by Eric ...... 

For those that do not yet know, there is a 
movement on campus to convince the Committee on 
Educational Policy that Physical Education Classes 
should be offered for credit (one half unit per class) and 
that four units (or eight classes) of this credit should be 
applicable towards graduation: 

Unfortunately, this same measure has been defeated 
by the CEP, chaired by Dr. Leonard Newmark of the 
Linguistics Department. for the' past few years because

Women Round Out 
Rugby Picture 

by Johnno Staight 

Well , my goodness 
gracious this past weekend 
was a busy one for the 
UCSD ruggers. Friday, the 
Women's rubgy club held 
its first scrimmage. The 
warm afternoon sun, the 
keg and a fi ne fi rst effort by 
the UCSD women , all 
contributed to a most 
rewarding rugby game . 
Twenty·fi ve players par-
tici pated in the en -
thusiastic, learning ex-
perience. Observer, Peter 
Sertic noted that the 
Women picked up the style 
and the rules of the game 
very quickly. Experience is 
the only thing needed to 
build a fine team, for talent 
is in abundance. The 
Women's rugby club plays 
its first game February 23 
against Cal State Nor-
thridge, here at UCSD. 

The other Triton ruggers 
traveled to Loyola for a pair 
of games. The first team 
struggled against an uneven 
Loyola Bears team. After an 
initial wild burst of energy 
on the Bears part, the 
Tritons dominated the 
game, by keeping up a 
constant attacking pressure 
on the ragged opposition . 

Trys were scored by But-
terball, John Rowland, and 
Med-school student Phil 
Adamson . Toe Gates, and 
Toe Sertic popped in a pair 
of conversions with the 
latter also contributing an 
infamous drop-kick .. UCSD: 
19 Loyola: O. 

In the second game, 
UCSD fielded a surprisingly 
strong team. The Loyola 
scrum outweighed the 
UCSD scrum by 40 pounds 
per man, but found no 
advantage against the 
determi ned and aggressive 
Tritons. The game began 
with fairly even play, but a 
hard-fought try by Kevin 
Sap in, gave UCSD a critical 
psychological advantage. 
Johnno Csonka was the star 
of the first half for the 
Tritons as he surprised the 
Loyola ruggers, (and his 
own teammates) with 
numerous displays of 
power - running and 
determi ned ball-handling. 
The UCSO ruggers began to 
pile up points, with trys by 
Mark Lewis, Bill Meister, 
Kevin Sapin (his second try 
of the day) and conversions 
by Hunter and Kaplan. 
Keith Kapland played an

the convnittee feels that PE has no academic merit. 
Several instructors have been able to convince the 

CEPotherwise, however, this has been achieved only on 
a very limited basis, and has had to be done on a class 
by class basis. At this time, the only classes that are 
offered for 0.5 units credit are Fencing, Skin and SCUBA 
Diving and Excercise, Nutrition and Weight Control 
Classes. 

Now, a volunteer group of students has begun cir-
culating petitions with the hope of getting enough 
signatures to convince the CEP that there is enough 
student support of the measure to warant closer study of 
the situation. The immediate goal of the students is to 
secure a postponement of the vote, which has been 
scheduled for Monday, so as to enable them to finish 
their research and obtain the necessary signatures . 

At the moment, the outlook is still bleak, despite the 
fact that the number of signatures obtained by press 
time had reached 600 (out of an expected total of 4,(00) 
in the two days that the petitions had been circulated. 

PE department sources say that they will probably be 
forced to list each class offered and prove to the CEP 
that it does have some academic merit . Even with this, it 
is doubtful that the CEP will rule in the favor of the PE 
department, because of the semantics involved in the 
phrase "academic merit ." 

The proposed change would not in any way change 
the prese~t structure of PE Classes, and it is doubtful

that it wi II in any way influence the already high 
enrollment. The classes will still be offered for no credit 
(by auditing the class) as well as the present pass·no 
pass system. Those who desire a grade will be able to 
receive one and this grade will be applicable toward 
their CPA as well as graduation . 

Sources in the PE department are in agreement that 
obtaining credit for the classes will not in any way lead 
to required classes in this field . 

Finan ci ally, the PE department does not expect that 
the passage of the measure will change any funding 
inside the department, but it could lead to any increase 
in HE's to the whole university. However since the 
classes wiil only offer 0.5 units, this will not be very 
significant . 

The status of the PE programs at other UC campuses is 
displayed in the chart attached to this article, and it can 
be seen that aI most all of the rest of the campuses offer 
credit, whether or not they support a major or minor 
prolll"am . Even UC Santa Cruz is attempting to bring its 
PE program up to par with the other schools this year , 
and are also preparing to offer PE for credit. 

A list of the members of the CEP is also attached ' to 
this article, and the volunteer student group ?(which has 
no name as of yet) asks students to contact these 
persons and voice their views on this matter. 

If anyone is interested in this issue and would like to 
volunteer their services, they can contact Eric Raisters 
at the TT office or at 45H)356. Many more signatures 
are still needed and any and all help will be appreciated .

hardened animal haters, 
whom she teases by staring 
at them. As to the other 
problems mentioned in 
Friday's Triton Times, the 
reporter did not spend 
much time verifying ,the 
reports . I witnessed the 
accident in which the girl 
fell down the stairs. She had 
a huge male Saint Bernard 
on a leash. She was being 
dragged by the dog and 
could not control it. All she 
had to do was release the 
leash and she would not 
have been hurt. The ac-
cident was caused because 
the dog was on a leash. This 
accident could have 
happened anywhere and 
has nothing to do with the 
issue of dogs on campus. As 
to Cleo Malone stepping 
into dog feces, he would be 
well advised that dogs 
usually do not defecate on 
the paved walk ways, and 
by walking on them and not 
the grass, he would save 
himself much difficulty. If 
we are to continue to enjoy 
the company of our dogs it 
wi II be necessary for others 
to speak up. The University 
should care more for our 
wishes than Cleo's shoes. 
After all , why come to 
school if you can't say good 
morning to Buster?

Nonetheless, two wonder-

Marsha Jahnke from the

tively . 

If the Pee Wee League 
isn't enough to prove that 
basketball does not thrive 
on height alone, Allison 
Chin should be the magic 
name that will disolve any 
doubt. Aptly described as 
an "Oscar Robertson·Jerry 
West combination," the

points for the Sharp 
Shooters against History II . 
Sue Flanigan of History II 
also showed some talent in 
the game as she chalked up 
17 points. 

The Boys Scouts Two 
Sticks League is led by 
Ogden Hall. Not only does 
Ogden have Juanita 
Thomas, the team's high

putting objects in a brown 
kraft bag beside his feet. 
We didn't know what to 
think until he put one of the

ate it. Grr-oss.

cornered him.
