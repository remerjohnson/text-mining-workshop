UNDERSTANDING: Council 
agrees to support cooperati ves 
in case of financial disaster 
By Erika Snider 
Staff Writer 

The A.S. Council secured last week the 
campus cooperati ves' fates in ca~e of finan-
cial difficulti es. The council also di sc ussed 
admi ss ions outreach and shol down an 
attempted override of A.S. President Sou ley 
Di all o's velo of the UCS A Advocacy 
Agend a. 

During its Wednesday meeting, the A.S. 
voted to renew its "oversight, accountability, 
li ability and responsibility" of the General 
Store Co-op, Che Cafc, Groundwork Books 
and the Food Co-op. The A.S. has held this 
responsibility since 1993, when the UCSD 
administration refused to continue to be finan-
cially liable for the co-ops. 

In this role, the A.S. must cover most and 
potentially all of the costs the co-ops would 
incur in the event of a financial disaster such as 
bankruptcy or a lawsuit. 

"We [the A.S.) are financially liable for the 
co-ops," said A.S. Vice President Finance Tony 
Fiori. "For example, if the co-ops are sued, the 
co-ops each have their own insurance. The 
insurance covers pan of it, but the A.S. would 
cover the rest." 

The measure to renew this financial support 
was overwhelmingly approved by the A.S. in a 
22 to nothing vote with one abstention. 

Fiori told the council that three of the four 
co-ops have lost money in the last year. 
However, Fiori added that there's no threat of 
financial insolvency for the co-ops. 

"We' ve reviewed the audits, and all of the 
co-ops seem to be in good condition," Fiori 
said. ''The chance of something happening to 
them is slim. They are all financially sound." 

Diallo said he agrees with Fiori . 
"Currently, I feel that the co-ops are in no 

financial danger," Diallo said. "Therefore. we

UCSD Professor's Book Focuses 
On the Gardens of Versailles 
TERRITORY: Mukerji 
discusses estate of 
France's Louis XIV 
By Annam Manthlram 
Staff Writer 

After discerning conneclions 
between the gardens of Versailles 
and Louis XIV's love of power, 
UCSD communications Professor 
Chandra Muke~i recently published 
a book entitled Territorial Ambitions 
and the Gardens of Versailles. 

Mukerji gave a presentation and 
signed copies of her book Thursday 
at the Pannikin Cafe in Del Mar. 

Mukerji discussed a garden's 
connection with its owner. She said 
that the individual and landscape 
share a deep connection. 

"The virtue of the person is 
located in the landscape and some-
how renects back onto the owner 
of the land," she said. 

Mukerji said she believes that 
Louis XIV, owner of the Versailles 
Gardens in the 17th century. 
reflected his territorial love of 
power on the design of his gardens. 

In her book, she describes how 
the gardens of Versailles were not 
designed only for aesthetic pleasures. 
but for military and political control. 

''The gardens constituted a kind 
of small-scale demonstration project 
of technical capacities to control 
nature and to control the environ-
ment." Mukerji said. "And part of 
what they demonstrated then were 
forms of military engineering." 

INTERNET: 
Students can still 
apply via mail 
Conti ....... from ..... 1 
cations process. and helps the envi-
ronment by cutting down on the 
use of paper applications. 

Each year, more than 200,000 
application brochures are printed 
and prospecti ve students II Ie over 
500.000 sheets of paper. Pathways is 
designed to reduce the volume of 
paperwork involved ill processing 
applications, making things easier 
for the applicants and the university. 

i 
u 

The gardens had wall systems 
that elevated different parts of 
walkways and terraces. Mukerji 
said that the control of visibility 
created by various elevations is an 
important element of fortress engi-
neering. During siege warfare. peo-
ple approaching the fortress could 
not see inside but people on the 
inside could see the people 
approaching from outside. 

"Use of illusion and elevations 
comes from military engineering," 
Mukerji said. 

According to Mukerji, Louis 
XIV also used the gardens as pro-
paganda. 

"The king had strict ideas on 
how visitors should see the gar-
dens," Mukerji said. ''The itiner-
aries, penned by the king himself, 
prescribed where people should 
walk, how they should tum, what 
statues they should admire and 
what views they were meant to 
appreciate. 

"These promenades were no 
romps in the park; they were for-
mal affairs with food and rest stops 
set out along the route . They 
required absolute obedience of par-
ticipants to the itineraries of the 
king, and somehow were meant to 
iriform their assessments of the 
king and his coun," she continued. 

Moreover. Mukerji said she feels 
that Louis XIV created the gardens 
with a political agenda in mind. 

''The promenades constituted an 
important, if obscure, means for 
doing politics." Mukerji said. "[The 

Pathways also gives applicants 
the opportunity to view up-to-
date information on each UC 
campus. 

"Because college catalogues arc 
printed many months ahead of the 
filing period, there is hound to be 
information that is outdated even 
before it reaches students and 
counselors," said Carla Ferri, UC 
director for undergraduate admis-
sions. "That won't happen with the 
Pathways system because the mate-
rials can be updated whenever ncc-
essary." 

The Pathways application 
option will not place students who 

kingj wanted people to see Ihe pow-
ers of France as a territorial power." 

Since building the gardens of 
Versailles required that whole vil-
lages. abbeys and cemeteries be 
10m down or dug up. Mukerji said 
she sees the garden expansions as a 
further exercise in political power. 

"In a comple", way. then. what 
you get in the gardens is a kind of 
political ideology that never claims 
that France is great or never makes 
an argument that France is the great-
est nation on earth, but instead dis-
plays France as having those quali-
ties, as having powers, military 
powers. engineering powers. aes-
thetic powers. powers of nature. 
powers of the heavens all combined 
inside these sights," Mukerji said. 

Mukerji said her fascination 
with the Versailles gardens is con-
sistent with her interest in commu-
nications. 

"I am really interested in the 
way in which objects communi-
cate," she said. "Most people think 
about language and mass media, 
but that 's not the only way in which 
people communicate. 

"We know that about clothes, 
and we know that about cars, and 
we know that about houses. but we 
also use the natural world as a way 
to make claims about who we are, 
and the kinds of problems we have. 
Part of what I enjoyed about doing 
this is to look at the way in which 
the natural world gets when created 
into systems of communication," 
she continued. 

file paper applications at a disad-
vantage. The on-line application 
requires the same $40 per campus 
fcc, but students who file on-line 
will have the option or paying by 
credit card. 

The filing periods for both meth-
ods of application are the same. 

"Some people, even those who 
have Internet access, will always 
choose to complete the application 
on paper," Ferri said. "The 
Pathways system is a maller of 
convenience and choice."

PINI N 
AND 

A 
O~ 

Commercialization at UCSD is an excellent 
opportunity for students to receive promotional 
paraphernalia and to learn about economic 
truths in the American business world, as well 
8y D.n Street. 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

There are many familiar sites 
that greet UCSD students as they 
roam around campus each day -
the Stuart Art Collection, a couple 
of guys with hacky-sacks, a big 
shiny library and, once in a while, 
a bunch of people in matching 
outfits passing out free samples 
from their little tents. 

The spectacle of a company like 
CBS or Seven/un magazine bring-
ing its tented menagerie to campus 
is the most obvious example of the 
commercialization of UCSD. 
Other examples include credit card 
companies trying to enlist students. 
and quarterly vendor fairs. 

Commercialization - which 
allows companies to seek the 
patronage of students on campus 
by providing entertainment and 
free swag...,... is a really great idea. 

The wQrd commercialization 
has many fteptive connotations .. 
Ideas like exploitation, material -

ism and greed quickly come to 
mind when discussing the topic . 
Unfortunately, however, in the 
'90s, commercialism has invaded 
virtually every aspect of daily life. 
Instead of focusing on some 
archaic academic idealism, leI's 
take a quick look at reality. 

Th~ commercial aspects of 
UCSD are better associated with 
words like entertainment value, 
economic reality and community .. 
These consumer-oriented events 
and opportunities offer UCSD stu-
dents diversion while responding 
to the contemporary economic 
environment. The events also 
bring UCSD students together. 

For students, the benefits of the 
commercial events are apparent. 
First of all, students can get all 
kinds of free stuff. Companies 
offer samples of their goods to get 
students hooked on their products. 
The companies also try to create 
lin entertaining environment to 
make products look better. Free 

stuff and entertainment catered 
directly to students add up to one 
thing - fun. 

Some might say that students' 
academic experiences should not 
be tainted by crass capitalism. 
Those who enjoy these events 
say, "Why not?" 

It seems absurd to think that an 
event that takes place on the 
Library Walk or near Sun God is 
in any way a distraction to any stu-
dent's academic pursuits. It's not 
like CBS brings big tents and 
giant inflatable cars into Center 
Hall or Seventeen conducts a 
model search in the middle of an 
O-chem lecture. These events do 
not interfcre with classes. 

In fact, the effel:t is quite the 
opposite. The commercial events 
offer a wclcome distraction from 
the scholastic rigors of UCSD. 
Students get to play interesting 
games and divert their minds from 
the pressures of academic life.

FROM OUR 
onsor 
When the university resorts to 
soliciting funds from the business 
industry, it tells the community 
that it is not managing its 
financial situation effectively 

By Jessyca Wallace 
Associate Opinion Editor 

Recently UCSD administrators 
assembled a committee to decide 
which corporate wnglomerate is 
going to bailout the university 
from its RIMAC debt. It is there-
fore necessa ry to examine the 
appropriateness of allowing private 
business to implement commercial 
advertising at our university, and 
what results from those actions. 

Commercializing UCSD by 
selling building names and allow-
ing vendors to set up on campus is 
annoying and low-class. Beyond 
that, it goes against what this uni-
versity supposedly believes makes 
an institution of higher education 
excellent. 

A decision was made by the 
university's planners at its incep-
tion to make UCSD an educational-
ly elite institution. The academic 
tone set for the campus ought to be 
upheld in order to provide stability 
and direction for its sophomoric 
students. 

Imagine a potential student vis-
iting UCSD, a university presumed 
to be an intellectual breeding-
ground, and discovering CBS has 
its own temporary headquarters set 
up on Sun God Lawn! Such com~ 
mercialization would leave a sour 
taste in the visitor's mouth and he 
would undoubtedly withdraw his 
application from this commercial 
haven. 

The university has insinuated 
over the years that it chooses to be 
considered a unique. thought -pro-
voking, architecturally-superb 
school with a curriculum equal to 
that of UC Berkeley and UCLA. If 

this is to be considered a conse-
quential undertaking, the university 
must then consider the ramifica-
tions effected by "selling ouL" 

First, it is essential to examine 
UCSD's relentless pursuit of 
uniqueness and excellence. 

When the Campus Planning 
Committee (CPe) first laid out its 
brilliant and perhaps over-cogitated 
system for modern architecture and 
aesthetic standards, the intent was 
to make the campus beautiful. It 
was to be a selling point of the uni-
versity for prospective students and 
their families, as well as a boasting 
point when international and gov-
ernmental tours come through 
town. 

One of the main reasons for 
building the Library Walk was to 
showcase Geisel Library - to be 
able to see the edifice, unobstruct-
ed, a1lthc way from Gilman Drive. 
Now, peering down Library Walk 
from Gilman oten permits views 
- not of the library as was origi-
nally intended - but, rather, enor-
mous inflatable Jeeps, soda bottles 
and mobile business enterprises. 

Some people believe that corpo-
rations that bring prizes, free T-
shirts and other promotional para-
phernalia to the university are pro-
viding a much-needed service for 
students. 

College students are poor and 
free stuff is always welcome, but 
that stuff which starts out free does-
n't always remain so. 

Entering the Price Center on any 
given day, it is conceivable to walk 
out with three or four new T-shirts 
and three or four new credit cards.

COMMENTARY: Accidental deaths relating to the widespread use of 
fen-phen for weight loss implicate greed in the medical community r-----------------------

THE FEN-PHEN FIASCO 
I 
I 

,~ For the Uninitiated, a Crepe 
I),j 4(y 4P. (pronounced CR AYPS) is like 

'., ~~ a French style quesadilla. It 
By NIJou Mostotl 
Staff Writer 

Since a 1992 publication by Dr. 
Michael Weintraub, a professor at 
the University of Rochester 
Medical School, in which he wrote 
about the combined appetite sup-
pressant drugs fennuramine 
(Pondimin) and phentermine 
(Ionamin) to create fen-phen , the 
diet world hasn ' t been the same. 

The wmbination drug was 
intended to he used hy people who 
were 30 percent or more over their 
ideal body weight. but doctors pre-
scribed it to anybody, even those 
who wanted to lose just 5 or 10 
pounds. Even diet specialists like 
Jenny Craig and Nutri/System 
Weight Loss Centers incorporated 
the drug into their diet and exercise 
programs. 

The success of fen-phen was 
due to both its balancing of emo-
tions and its control of hunger. 
Phentcrmine enhances levels of 
dopamine and norepinephrine, 
which affect blood flow, heart beat, 
movement and reactions to stress. 
The drawback is that the drug 
makes people hyperactive, anxious 
and unable to control excess stress . 

Fenfluramine acts on one neuro-
transmitter, serotonin, which is 
involved in controlling states of 
consl:iou 'ness, moods and emo-
tions. The lack of serotonin has 
been implicated not only in depres-
sion, uncontrollable appetite and 
obsessive-compulsive disorder but 
in bulimia, social phohias, premen-
strual syndrome, anxiety and panic, 
as well. 

The combination of phetcrmine 
and fenfluramine bahlRces the 
effects to create Ics~ anxIety and 
higher leve ls of appetite l o~, . 

The FDA never approved the 
combo drug. Phentermrne and fen-
tluramine were approved for indi -
vidual usc, but were never to he 
prescribed together. It seems suspi-
I:ious that this gives doctors the 
right to prescribe them "off label." 

Also, the usc of fenfluramine 
was approved for ingestion for 
periods of only three months at a 
time and to be used only by clini-
r.allv "!)esc people. Many doctors

to patients who were merely over-
weight and recommended taking 
them at six-month intervals, a vio-
lation of the FDA and drug-compa-
ny prescri ption criteria and recom-
mendations. 

Fen-phen was pulled off the 
market in September, and the ques-
tion remains : who is to blame for 
the accidental deaths that resulted 
from inappropriate usagc? 

The side effccts of the drug are 
headache, nauseJ, fatigue, diarrhea, 
insomnia, depression, blood-pres-
sure increase, spaciness and short-
term memory loss. Dangerous, pri -
mary pulmonary hypertension and 
ahnormalitics in the shape of heart 
valves arc quite serious and have 
numerou s side clTel:ts, hut that 
didn't seem to hinJer doctor, from

A 50-year-old high-profi Ie Los 
Angeles attorney stated that her 
level of productivity decreased, yet 
she stayed on fen-phen for a year 
because it was the only thing that 
worked for her. 

My cousin also didn ' t care 
about the side effects and wanted to 
take the drug, anyway. Is thi.s soci-

Doctors welcomed the drug 

because they saw a fanatically 
weighl-I:onsl:ious publil: eager to 
shed pounds, demanding Ihe pills at 
any pril:e, no mailer how astronom-
Ical. For example, a UCLA pro-
gram charged $235 a month and 
$50 per month. At privatel:iinics, n 
start-up fee of $65 or more and a 
weekly fcc of $35 were common. 

There is a big rush by doctors to 
fill a $5.6 billion void in the mar-
ketplace. Incomc originating from 
fen-phen sales has dried up, leaving 
doctors crambling for alternate 
diet drugs. They have resoned to 
intra-i ndustry marketing tactics for 
drugs that arc allegedly unsafe or 
Ineffective. 

This practice is harnlful to those 
susceptible members of society 
who are interested in losing weight, 
no matter the cost. The responsibil-
ity for this inappropriate usage of 
fen-phen rests firmly with the med-
ical community, the commercial 
weight-loss industry and the FDA 
for unsuccessfully monitoring the 
prescription of these drugs.

A~ pan of the Center for U.S.-

A II of the~e events are open to

However, we simultaneou~ly 
tell reponers that gueM speakers 
arc available for individual inter-
views with journalists (indeed, on-
the-record interviews, if the speak-
er has no objection) before and 
after formal sessions or during 
scheduled breaks in the proceed-
ings. 

The center has long pursued this 
policy in a reasoned effon to ~trike 

a balance between encouraging 
open discussion between senior 
policy makers and the audience. on 
the one hand, and providing the 
media with acce~s to guest speak-
ers, on the other. 

To my knowledge, no responsi-
ble joumali~t ha~ ever violated 
the~e ground rule~ for press cover-
age. nor have journalists found 
them to be particularly onerous. 

Contrary to the allegation in 
your editorial of Oct. 23. the Center 
for U.S.-Mexican Studies did not 
deny the Glwrdilln an opportunity 
to report on forum discussions. In 
fact , the Oct. 20 i s~ue of your paper 
carried a lengthy article on the 
worbhop, with exten~ive ~um ­
manes of indi viduab workshop 
panicipants' presentations. 

Before decrying alleged viola-
tions of the constitutional protec-
tion for press freedom. the 
Guardiall might have investigated 
whether the center \ ground rules 
for press coverage violate UCSD 
policy guideline in thi s area . They 
do not. 

If the Guardian has any linger-
ing doubts on this point , I urge you 
and your colle<lgues to consult with 
the UCSD Oflicc of the Campus

Aside from providing free 
entenainment to students, the on-
campus commercial events are 
pan of the academic/economic 
~ynergy that helps to push UCSD 
into the ne~tmillennium . Without 
money from commercial sources. 
UCSD would not be the high-
quality educational institution 
that it is today. 

The commercial aspects of 
UCSD also work to introduce stu-
dents to the economic realities of 
the world today. There arc very 
few institutions that do not have 
connections with the commercial 
world. Why should UCSD be any 
different'? 

Every student at UCSD will be 
haunted by the spcl:ler of commer-
ciab, endorsements and jingles for 
the rest of their Ii ves. College is 
the perfect place in which to learn 
tu deal with commercial pressure 
in the best way. Sheltering stu -
dents from real life experience 
should not be the aim of UCSD. 

The same goes for credit-card 
peddlers. These vendors offer stu-
dents the chance to establish good 
credit records early in life. If a 
student run~ up a high balance it 
is his own fault. The commercial 

Commercialized events would 
not exist on campus if there was 
not a consumer demand for them . 
Companies would cease to 
patronize UCSD if students did 
not attend these events. 

Students spend a lot of time 
and money at Library Walk shop-
ping for posters and jewelry while 
vendors profit. Also, student~ 
wait in line to play games and get 
free samples while companies 
advenise their products. 

In short, students welcome 
commercialization . The COITl -
mercial events offer a valuable 
service that benefit students, as 
well as create profit for vendors 
and companies. 

UCSD is much maligned for 
its lack of community. The 
sprawling campus docs not facili-
tate any son of student congrega-
tion. Commercial events work to 
build community by giving stu -
dents an incentive to hang out in 
the same place. 

Quarterly vendor fai rs and 
company-~ponsored events bring 
students together. Students can 
shop with friends and make new 
ones playing games. Commercial 
events offer students an opportuni -
ty to relax and enjoy time with 
each other on campus. The enter-
tainment created by vendor fairs 
and company events is valuable

appeals to the more intellectual 
teeny-boppers, not college-aged 
women. 

Se\lenteen would be better ser-
vicing the UCSD community and 
its readership by asking UCSD 
students to act as role models for 
these teenagers. rather than super-
models. 

This fall, UCSD introduced the 
all-new Triton Plus Card - a Plus 
card, student ID and library card 
all-in-one (which functions 
remarkably like the old ID card, 
merely with a face-lift). A new 
feature, however, is the AT&T 
Calling Card already integrated 
into the ID card. All that is 
required is to call up AT&T and 
ask for service. 

The university endorses AT&T 
by including its logo on the UCSD 
student ID card, associating not 
only the university with the com-
pany, but the students as well. This 
is offensive because not all stu-
dents wish to utilize AT&T's ser-
vices or involuntarily advertise for 
the company. 

If a calling card service must 
be associated with the Triton Plus 
Account shouldn't the students 
be allowed to choose which 
phone company they patronize? 

The UCSD Guardian 

Doe~ the university feel that 
AT&T is such a wonderful corpo-
ration that students should auto-
matically choose to enlist its ser-
vices? Where did the money that 
the university received from 
AT&T go? 

It is possible that in the near 
future RIMAC could be renamed 
after an outside corporation. like 
Qualcomm, because the financial 
situation of the arena is in poor 
condition and the university needs 
to be rescued? 

This is only an idea that the 
administration is batting around. 
but should it even be a considera-
tion? Is selling the naming rights 
to a university facility a precedent 
the administration is interested in 
selling? 

Commercialization does not 
make our university unique in any 
way. In fact, most universities and 
city governments around the 
country submit to commercial 
endorsements to make easy 
money. 

UCSD should never have to 
resort to collecting money from 
the major corporations; rather it 
should use the funds already allo-
cated to the university by the gov-
ernment. Selling out would no

longer be a necessity for the func-
tioning of integral UCSD student 
services - thus eliminating the 
need to substantially raise registra-
tion fees, to cut O.A.S.I.S. or to 
mllllmize Disabled Student 
Services. 

UCSD is not an isolated insti -
tution within the economy of the 
United States. The commercial-
ization of the university is merely 
a symptom of the growing imbal-
ance between the financial sol-
vency of businesses and the 
decreasing funds of the govern-
ment. 

Our economic basis in capital-
ism has created a situation where 
the business community has 
greater wealth than the govern-
ment itself. This scenario leaves 
the government, as it does the uni -
versity, soliciting money from 
Wall Street.

Learning a valuable 
economics lesson 
ContInued frOlll ...... 
because it brings students together. 

The commercialization of 
UCSD should not be an issue of 
academic idealism. The time is 
long past when a university can 
stand out as a dignified beacon of 
academic truth amid the dark tem-
pest of crude commercialism. 
UCSD must function in an environ-
ment where commercialism is an 
economic reality. 

Companies come to UCSD and 
give students exactly what they 
want - free stuff and cheap enler-
tainment. 

The simple fact is that vendors 
and companies meet a consumer 
demand that exists on campus. 
UCSD cannot and should not 
attempt to exist in an economic 
vacuum. 

The university and each student 
attending it are part of a real eco-
nomic system that can be greatly 
beneficial to higher education. The 
commercialization of UCSD 
enhances student life while helping 
out companies and vendors.

How do you think your sexual ori-
entation affected your experi-
ence? 

It I-. cpt thing~ separatc, and sim-
pler. Ii was separa te from my Ideas 
of love and ,exualit y. I gues\ II 
maue it ea,i er bel:au.e you uon't 
app ly it to your real life. A IOL of Lhe 
girls werc hisexual or bhian .. . or 
curious. Bu t, I don't Lhink that any 
01 the gir ls applieu the work to 
their life. Rel a t ion shir~ with cus-
tomers were very separate from 
real relationships in the girls' li ves. 
Old you date anyone while you

were workln&? 
Yes, for a while. The hours 

made it hard. 
Old she mind that you stripped? 

No. 
Do you think stripping objectifies 
women? 

No, I reall y don' t. I don ' t think 
it matters what the guys si tti ng 
there th ink , a~ long as it doesn' t 
hUrl the g irl ~ . 
Old you feel that you were taking 
advantage of the men, rather 
than vice versa? 

Ye" yOU ree l like you arc rip-
ping them off. You can ' t help but 
feel that you Jrc in control of the 
situ ,lIlOn. The CUM omers may thi n\..

Do you consider yourself a femi-

Ye" I do, hut I am not " radical 
separatist. I think Ihat the fclll lll i,t

ridiculous. But. San Diego i, a 
much diffe rent place. The girls here

The UCSD Guaraian 

"[The Human Sexuality 
course] is a course that has 
evolved over the years. I was 
asked to teach it by a chancellor, , . 
The reason for that was that he 
was being pushed upon by the leg-
islature because the legislature 
was very concerned about the high 
number of teenage pregnancies in 
California. and that the profes-
sionals. graduates of the 
University of California syslem, 
did not seem to be able to cope 
very much with, didn 't seem to be 
very knowledgeable about, sexu-
ality. So, he just targeled me.

"What I don't like about il is 
lhat I wish there were a better spir-

I wish that students could feellhey

Perhaps people have a hard time 
dealing with downtown La Jolla

real gripe rests with the tourists. 

However, I don' t think it's just 
the tourists who arc out on the 
highways flinging their cars into 
lanes already full of traffi c. When 
you need to change lanes. please 
try to make certain there isn't a car

vice versa for women who 
look at men - which 
women shouldn't do."

Psycho Therapy 
Have questions? Need answers? 
New advice column can help out 
By Mary HIggins Senior Staff Writer 
"Not A Licensed Therapist" 

Due to the overwhelming 
response to the Mon., Oct. 6 article 
on dating ("Dear Mary, my 
boyfriend of three years just 
dumped me after reading your arti -
cle. Thanks a lot!"), the editors of 
this fine publication have given me 
my very own column. 

Basically, this means that I 
occasionally have to cough up two 
to three double-spaced pages of 
material, enabling every Triton 
(that 's you) to benefit from my wis-
dom. Sort of like Ann Landers if 
she were a repressed, fourth-year 
UCSD student. 

There are those in the 
Guardian office who wonder if I 
can take the pressure of a regular 
deadline. I'm not concerned. On 
the contrary, I am quite comfort-
able voicing my opinion on mat-
ters I know nothing about, such as 
nuclear fusion and the night pat-
terns of Norwegian sparrows. Ask 
any of my friends , and they' ll tell 
you I have a big mouth. That is, 
they would if they could get a 
word in edgewise. 

I feel fortunate to possess this 
rare brcmd or eloquence - usually 
only found in chronic drunks and 
communicati ons major. . Lucky 
me, thi s girt aU lomatically ensures 
me a li fetime memhershlp in the 
Republican party. 

I don 't know whcthcr people 
actually believe me, or if they ' re 
too polite to tell me they think I'm 
full of cow-pucky. The other day, 
for example, I effortlessly provided 
my best friend Eli zaheth with 
advice about her long- term rela-
tionship. Lillie did her boyfriend 
know that someone he'd met only 
brieny during summer break was 
now determining hi s fate. 

I'm prelly confident about lhe 
advice I gave her, though I.myself 
have never had a boyfriend for 
longer than two-and-a-half months. 
These days, that's almost as long as 
an average marriage. Moreover, 

This article Is not 
Intended to offend 
drunks, Republicans 
or communications 
majors ••• I know 
many fine people 
who claim they're 
Republicans. 
Sometimes I even 
date Republicans -
but only w ..... I'm 
*1IIIk. 
I've witnessed plenty of long-term 
relationships - enough so to know 
what I'm talking about at least half 
of the time. 

So here I am, wilh a column of 
my own. Former Guardian colum-
nists have lackled tough, pivotal 
topics such as communism, flag -
burning, abortion and on-campus 
parking. You won't find any of that 
in my column. Not that I couldn 't 
pull somel hing out of my ... er ... hat 
if I had to, because I can tackle the 
important issues just as well as the 
next girl. 

I'm su re you really couldn ' t 
care less what I think about peace 
in the Middle East. What you real-
ly want to know is how to get your 
roommate 10 stop walking around 
the apartment wearing nothing but 
cowboy boots and a flowered 
shower cap. Or perhaps you' 'Ie 
been thinking about sex for years, 
but you're still not quite sure what 
an orgasm is. You ' re dying for 
answers 10 all those tough ques-
tions your residence advisor just 
isn't qualified to answer. 

Enough about me. Let's talk 
about you. I want to know all about 
your problems. Share with me your 
stories of humiliation, your greatest 
fears, your anguished soul. I want 
to delve into your scarred psyche. 

No story is too personal. No leHcr 
will be ignored. So please write to 
me and I promise I'll do my very 
best to give you professional, com-
petent advice. Or at least I hope to 
get a good laugh. 

About those delicate, embarrass-
ing sel( questions you might have ... 
I'm sure I won ' t be able to answer 
any of them, but I promise I'll put 
my research team right to work and, 
by golly, we ' ll lind someone who 
does. We may have to take a field 
trip over to 5 DSU, but the effort 
will be worthwhile if I know I've 
helped even one person. 

I vow to respect your anonymi-
ty. You can drop your question off 
at the Guardian office or you can e-
mail it straight to me. My goal is to 
earn your respect and IruSI. I want 
you to think of me as a friend, and 
not jusl some smart-mouthed, 
vengeful journalist who is biller 
because she's on academic proba-
tion and will not graduate in thi s 
millennium. Your secret is safe 
with me. That is, unless it's really 
hilarious, in which case I'll forward 
II to all@lIcsd.edLl.

QUARTERS: 
Pair of wins sends 
UCSD to Virginia 
Continued from page 24 
respective sidelines and kept the 
game on Gustavus' side of the fi eld. 

"I thought we came out really 
well ," senior mid fielder Kate 
Larsen said. "We might have been 
physically tired but mentally we 
were a lot stronger. Lasl ni ght was 
really nerve-racking hut the crowd 
was awesome and kept us go ing, so 
we just dug in." 

In the 18th minute, the constant 
pressure paid off when senior for-
ward Lauren Johnson 's perfecl cor-
ner kick from the right nag was 
headed in by fellow senior Beth 
Freeburg. Starting members of the 
1995 and 1996 championship 
squads, Freeburg and Johnson have 
combined to score numerous times 
from similar set plays in 1997. 

On Sunday, Johnson looped the 
comer kick over the crowd of play-
ers in the 6-yard box to a waiti ng 
Freeburg at the back post and the 
se nior sweeper from Pasadena deft-
ly banged the ball past Gustavus 
keeper Tara Joo~ten ror the 1-0 
lead. 

"Sometimes it clicks, and today 
it was awesome," Johnson said. 
"Their goalkeeper was so timid 
today and I knew that Beth would 
be there so I just wanted to keep 
hilling that pot." 

Freeburg compared the two 
games: " It didn 't work last night 
because they had girls pinching me. 
hut they didn ' l have anyhody on me 
today. They never even hothered 
mark i ng me, making it very easy. 
Lauren hits them very we ll and it 
just didn't seem as if they caught 
on." 

The 1-0 lead ~tood up through 
halftime. hut Gustavus would not 
go away. After their 4-2 clobbering 

of Cal Lutheran the day before, the 
Gusties kept their momentum and 
found thei r scoring touch in the 
66th IllInute of play. Freshman phe-
nomenon Kristin Eklund took a 
denet;ted pass and beat Jennifer 
Hetland far side to knot the contest 
at one goal apiece. 

"After we saw them play yester-
day, we definitely thought we rould 
win today," Gustavus Head Coach 
Mike Stehlik said. "You're not 
going to come into the game think-
ing, 'Oh my God, we're not going 
to win.' Any four of the teams [that 
were here this weekend] could have 
advam:ed. rUCSDJ was just able to 
exploi t our weaknesses. We're just 
not very good in the air thi s year." 

For the go-ahead score, UCSD 
turned to the Johnson-Freeburg 
combination in the 81 st minute of 
play. After the Tritons won a free 
kick on the right side of the 18-yard 
box , the Golden Gusties could be 
seen screaming deja VII . Johnson 's 
precise boot found its way to the 
back po,t again, where Freeburg 
buried it in the back of the net for 
the 2-0 lead. 

"We've been preaching all sea-
son aboul set plays in big games," 
Triton Head Coach Brian 
McManus said. "Your set plays are 
very important. Beth 's one of these 
people that knows where the ball is 
going to be. She just focuses on the 
ball, and she watches nothing else. 
She's not worrying about anything 
and she's got a knack for gelling a 
piece of it. It was just tremendous." 

Three minutes later, Johnson 
added a goal of her own on another 
set play - a looping free kick that 
~ai led over Joosten from the same 
~pot on the right side - for the 
commanding 3- 1 advantage. 

"From what we saw yesterday, 
we knew [Gustavus l wa~ a very 
direct team," McManus said. 
"They've got the three girls at the 
top that ju~t run at you, they Just

employees whip me up a fruit smoothie with blueberries. bananas, and 
pineapple juice. My favorite! 

Pierre has been on a health kick lately. so he made a meal for himself 
at Oceanview's famous salad bar with a side of steamed mixed veggies 
from Options, Oceanview's answer to lowfat, reduced calorie entrees and 
side!;. He piled his salad high with fresh cut greens anJ decorated them 
with broccoli buds, alfalfa sprouts, kidney beans, onions, cherry tomatoes, 
and raisins, then dressed the lot with red wine vinegar and virgin olive oil. 

We sat out on the deck and the view was absolutely amazing! While 
stuffing our little faces, Pierre and I watched the hang gliders flying over 
the ocean as the sun set. It was magnificent!

Tritons Upset No. 6 Ranked UC Irvine 
MOVIN' ON UP: Ranked No, 8 nationaJly, UCSD traveled to UC Irvine's pool and avenged an early-season loss to the 
Anteaters with an impressive 6-5 victory, a win that could possibly vault the Tritons into their highest national ranking ever 
By Jon .. NIHnson 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

It's time to party! The UCSD 
men's water polo team pulled out a 
huge win on the road over No. 6 

ranked UC Irvine. 
Thi s calls for a 
celebration. What 
kind of celebra-
tion? A rousing 
game of monop-
oly? Sounds 
interesting. Speed 
Sewing? Definite 
possibilities. Oh 

wait, don't jump the gun! The sea-
son is not over. 

Sure, a celebration is in order, 
but the Tritons sti II have the play-
offs to think about, in addition to 
two games this weekend. The rager 
will have to wait, rowdy ones. 

Yesterday's big win for the 
Tritons was played in scenic and 
exciting Orange County. It was a 
rematch of a game played earlier 
this year between the two teams at 
Stanford In the NorCal 
Tournament. That game saw the 
tired Triton squad, who was not up 
to the challenge of the bulky 
Anteaters, lose 11-4. This time, 
however, the Tritons snatched a 6-5 
win, lifting their record to 11-10. 

On Sunday, the Tritons cleared 
their minds of previous games 
played in Irvine. This time, speed 
would be the weapon used to com-
bat a physical Anteater squad. 

"Mugfest" could have been the 
name of the game in their last 
matchup, as the Anteaters mauled 
the Tritons. When UCI allempted 
to play with the same style on 
Sunday, the Tritons' week-long 
training had prepared them for such 
an attack. 

"They played the same game 
that they played at Stanford," Head 
Coach Denny Harper said. "We just 
did a beller job. We didn't get mus-
cled in front of the goal. We played 
a lot smarter and the other thing 
that worked to perfection was that 
these are big guys who lift weights 
all the time, which is ta1(ing when 
you swim up and down the pool. 
Our plan was to really play an up-
tempo game - swimming, swim-
ming, swimming - to get them 
exhausted. I thought that in the 
fourth quarter, Irvine really looked 
spe n I." 

In an open division, which 
means there is no distinction 
between Division I schools and 
Division III schools (besides 
expensive alumni dinners and 
brand new cars for family mem-
bers), UCSD came into the match 
ranked No. 8 nationally while UCI 
held the No.6 spot in the polls. 

While none can claim to know 
the minds of the NCAA ranking 
commillee, the Tritons could possi -
bly move up to a No. 7 ranking -
the highest the Tritons have ever 
ranked in the NCAA. 

"Romas stepped It 
up to his potential 
In scoring tho .. 
four goals and 
leading the team 
to victory. We need 
to keep the 
momentum ,olng 
Into next weekend 
and the WWPAs 
after that. " 

- I." Z.tIrzewskl 

Moving up in the rankings was 
not on the minds of the Tritons 
early in the game though, as UCI 
jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the first 
two minutes of the game on goals 
by ROQerl Allaire and Ryan 
Williams. Harper immediately 
called a timeout to regroup and 
focus his team. 

"I was a little concerned when 
we were down 2-0, but I didn't 
panic," Harper said. '1'ypically, I 
don't like to call those early time-
outs but I thought it was really nec-
essary. I think the timeout was 
somewhat calming and we came 
right back after that and scored." 

The score came late in the first 
quarter with a goal by senior hole 
sct Romas Kudirka. Deciding to 
take mailers into his own hands, 

Kudirka went on to score two more 
in the second quarter to tie the 
game at 3-3 with 3:43 left in the 
first half. 

The Tritons, however, were not 
done yet. Sophomore 2-meter 
defender Ross Mecham decided he 
wanted a part of the 'action and 
swred a goal to put the Tritons up 
4-3. Unfonunately, a UCSD foul 
with one second left in the first half 
gave UCl's Allaire a penalty shol. 
He was up to the task, tying the 
game going into halftime. 

The two teams traded posses-
sions in the third quaner but Allaire 
scored with 4:0 I left in the quarter, 
giving UCI a 5-4 lead. Kudirka 
refused to fall any further behind, 
as he dumped in his fourth goal of 
the day out of 2-meters, tying the 
game, 5-5. 

In the fourth, both teams looked 
for opportunities to score, but it 
was senior team captain Adam 
Bollenbach who stepped up to put 
the Tritons ahead 6-5 on a counter-
attack with 5:27 left in the game. 
The two schools again traded pos-
sessions and with 44 seconds left 
on the clock, UCI had the ball and 
called ti meout. 

Coming out of the timeout, UCI 
tried a quick pass play. Senior team 
captain Adam Bollenbach read the 
eyes of the man he was defending 
and stole the pass with an out-
stretched arm. Harper .called a 
quick timeout when multiple UCI 

players converged on Bollenbach. 
The Tritons saw a victory 

approaching and didn't give their 
rivals any opponunity to regain 
possession following the timeoul. 

Junior Andy Silvestri and 
sophomore Jason Boettner played 
keep away for the remaining sec-
onds of the match until the buzzer 
sounded. 

"Romas was the man at 2 
meters, it was great to see him 
break out and get four great in the 
cage," Harper said. "I thought 
[goalkeeper Patl Beemer played a 
really solid game - good outlets, 
and he came out of the cage for 
some key steals. Mecham was a 
solid defender and getting Boettner 
back made a big difference." 

Boellner, who had sustained an 
ankle injury earlier in the season, 
had been expected to miss the rest 
of the season. He must have come 
across Mr. Miagi between now and 
then because his ankle has healed 
almost 100 percenl. 

"Romas stepped it up to his 
potential in scoring those four 
goals and leading the team to victo-
ry," junior Ian Zakrzewski said. 
"We need to keep the momentum 
going into next weekend and the 
WWPAs after thaI." 

UCSD hosts UC Santa Cruz at 
Canyonview Pool at 6 p.m. on 
Friday and will then play Long 
Beach State at noon on Saturday at 
the same location.

Can Anyone Stop The Triton Juggernaut? 
UNSTOPPABLE: UCSD ends the regular season with 18 straight wins 
and will host postseason activities starting this Thursday at RIMAC Arena 
By Steve Walsh 
Senior Staff Writer 

It was only appropriate that on 
Senior Night setter Sherine Ehadl , 
the lone player graduating from the 

1997 UCSD 
women's volley-
ball team. played 
a key role in Ihe 
Tritoll ~' Vi, LOr) 
over Chapman 
UniversllY on 
Saturday. 

At'ter Ebadi 
lead the team in a 

stunning rendition of the national 
anthem, the Tritons look the noor 
against Chapman University. They 
won the match, gaining their 18th 
consecutive victory and remained 
undefeated against Division ))) 
opponents. 

The No.3 ranked Tritons found 
themselves stumbling early against 
the upset-minded Panthers. UCSD 
opened game one looking like the 
underdog as it failed to establish a 
consistent offensive attack and 
made a number of service errors.

While UCSD struggled 10 lind

attack, the Tritons appeared to h.' in 
lu r u long night a, the Panthl.:r~

ot wanllng to send Ebadl OUI 
on a down note, UCSD soon found 
the game that had been prominent 
in its record breaking season. 

After struggling with serving in 
the first game, McFarland had 
Ebadi continue to fire her deadly 
jump serve while Jamie Hackleman 
and Shannon Hawes bombed away 
with their aggressive noaters. With 
the serving game working, the 
Triton defense stepped up its play 
and began digging balls that had 
been easy points in the lirs!. 

After jumping out to an early 
lead, UCSD continued to apply the 
pressure as hitters Dana Salter, 
Allison Bender and Hawes made 
use of an rejuvenated offense to 
rack up kills. 

The Tritons looked nothing like 
the team that had faltered in thc 
first as they made quick work of 
Chapman to knot the match at I - I.

hoped to IlI llVC back 10 h<: r natura l

hut ~hc'~ 'ollunucd to excel at Sl: l-
ter." 

Riding a nc'>' wave of emotion, 
the Tritons looked like a champI-
onshIp tcam in game three a, they 
kept the Panthers on their heels. 

Ebadl conunued to spread out 
the offensive attack among the hit-
ters that stopped Chapman from 
establishing a defensive front. 
While the Panther frontline strug-
gled, the UCSD front row shined 
with junior Shannon Noonan re-
establishing the Triton block. 

There was no stopping the 
Tritons as they closed out the Ihird 
game. 

UCSD continued to impress in 
the fourth game. Despite a series of 
substitutions, the Tritons showed 
no ill effects as they linished off 
Chapman to close out their regular 
scason with a 22-5 record. 

"We started out very sluggish," 
Triton Head Coach Duncan 
McFarland said. "I take a pretty 
large amount of responsibility for 
that; I started with a lineup that was 
different than they have seen for a 
while. We were serving very easy 
that first game and they came out 
and served tough. To have a team 
that serves really tough involves 

Between the second and . third 
games, UCSD honored Ebadi, who 
has been critical in the team's suc-
cess and ranks among the national 
leaders in assists. With the RIMAC 

While Saturday was Ebadi 's 
final regular season home game, 
she and the Tritons will get to play 
in front of their fans ne1(t weekend 
as they host the NCAA West 
Regionals.

team, stretches to block another shot from her setter position.

QUARTERFINALS: 
UCSD begins the road 
to its third consecutive 
National title with two 
wild victorie 

SenIOr Staff Writer 
The ~occer fans who \howed 

up at Triton Soccer Stadium fo r 
the Divi~ion III Western 

Regionals in the 
hope of witness-
ing UCSD domi-
nation fo und 
themselves in for 
a surpri se. What 
they saw was 
more like an anx-
iety attack, fol -
lowed by an ulcer 

and mixed in with a heart attack or 
two. Ultimately, though, the victory 
belonged to the Tritons. 

After a t"hrilling, double-over-
time 2-1 victory over the 
University of Chicago Maroons 
Saturday night, UCSD advanced to 
the NCAA National Quarterfinals 
with a hard-fought 3-1 win over 
Gustavus Adolphus College yester-
day afternoon. 

The Tritons will square off 
against Mary Washington 
University in Fredricksburg, Va. 
this weekend for a chance to 
advance to the Final Four. 

After witnessi ng the grueling 
overtime contest the night before, 
the Golden Gusties of Gustavus 
Adolphus hoped to catch the 
Tritons a bit tired, but the home 
squad took control of the game 
from the start. UCSD earned some 
corner kicks early as Alison Hurley 
and Yasmin Suarez worked their

MO' SOCCER: This Wednesday at 5 p.m. at Triton Soccer Stadium the men take on Claremont 
By Travis Hili 
Sports Editor 

Attention UCSD students I Drop 
your O-chem labs, put down the 
physics books, corne out of the 
AP&M Building balle-
ment , hey - even stop the 
communications studying. 

The UCSD men 's soc-
cer team has made the 
playoffs, and UCSD is 
hosting the first game this 
Wednesday at 5 p.m. at 
Triton Soccer Stadium. 
This is a very important 
game. People, we need to go ol;lt 
and give these guys our support. 

There wi II be no excuses, 
regardless of midterms or papers 

- do you think Ihat Ihe players get 
10 skip out on their work? No. So 
take a few hours out of your "busy" 
schedules and get out there! 

Why the urgent plea? Secause, 
for those who were at the 
Regional playoffs this 
weekend to cheer the 
UCSD women 's soccer 
team, you can take a little 
credit. The constant cheer-
ing did nothing but help 
the women in their pair of 
victories, and the players 
will be Ihe firslto say that. 

"We need a decent crowd out 
there," UCSD Head Coach Derek 
Armstrong said . "This school 
needs something to rally around,

The game will be played against 

Claremont College, a tough team 
who beat the Tritons 2-0 earlier this 
year in their house. This time, the 
Stags are coming here to play 
under the lights, and nothing would 
help the Tritons more than a rowdy 
crowd. 

As for the game itself, the 
Tritons are obviously pleased that 
this tough game wi II be played on 
La 10lla soil. 

"[Hosting] is perfect for the 
Claremont game," sophomore mid-
fielder Cameron Adams said. "Our 
field is a lillie bigger than their's, 
and I think that will help us. Also, 
we had another good practice [Ias~

If the Tritons win against 
Claremont, they will advance to the 
Western Regionals of the NCAA 
playoffs next weekend, to be held 
at Cal Lutheran, where Lhey will do 
battle with their hated rivals. 

For right now, though, the 
Tritons are focusing on Claremont. 

"Obviously, the goal now is to 
go further than last year," 
Armstrong said. "Sut right now 
we're concentrating on 
Wednesday." 

Triton fans, get out there and 
support your soccer team!
