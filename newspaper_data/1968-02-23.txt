Charlie Moore shown here discussing his eviction from the Revelle i'loo;e" a SaaysbiCh ~HUU~~MU. 
Violates Rules 

About 75 people attended a 
rally Thursday February 15 to 
hear of the eviction of Charlie 
Moore. He was evicted by Dean 
Rull February 13 and given 48 
hours to move out. Moore said 
he was unfairly evicted for " ex-
tremely insignificant offenses --
hanging a sign out his window, 
eating in the Muir cafeteria with-
out a Muir meal card, and having ' 
two girls in his room during a 
party. 

Moore felt the dean had vio-
lated the rules in the student 
handbook under Section V, Stu-
dent Conduct and DiSCipline. He 
said that the dean had given him 
"merely an arbitrary verbal no-
tice with no right ~of appeal, and 
that the 48 hours specified in the 
contract was not enough time to 
move out. He claimed that the 
American Civil Liberties Union 
told him the eviction was illegal, 
since seven days is the minimum 
specified by California law. The 
AC LU advised him to stay .and 
force the University to prove in 
court that he violated the con-
tract. 

Moore felt students should be 
able tCJ overn themselves. He 

M u i ri a ns To Try 
Schultz' Plan 

The Mutr--College residents 
decided at a meeting Wednesday 
night to change Matthews cafe-
teria to an open, a la carte sys-
tem for a two week trial period 
beginning as soon as the new 
system can be set up. The sys-
tem was proposed by Dr. Schultz 
as a solution to the current 
cafeteria problems. The test will 
determine the practicality of the 
system and possibly lead to anew 
system in both cafeterias. 

The Muir College Committee 
on Student Affairs called for a 
meeting of all residents alter 
the proposal was presented to 
them with the request for the 
trial period. Matthews cafeteria 
was chosen for the test because

criticized the rules, saying that 
girls in his room "violated no 
civil or moral law." He said that 
almost everyone has girls in his 
room; he knows of many other 
people who have been caught. 
"I believe I have been singled 
out, said Moore, a member of 
the steering committee ofthe SIL. 

Willy Brant, a friend of Moore , 
visiting from UC Berkeley, said 
that his friends woul d not allow 
their fellow students to be evic-
ted at Berkeley and that UCSD 
students should organize to keep 
Moore in. Moore, he felt, was 
being evicted because he was 
"different. " 

Tom Hull, dean of students at 
Revelle, admitted at the rally 
his procedural error and said he 
would speak further on the sub-
ject only in his office. After 
criticism by students, he gave his 
reasons for evicting Moore, add-
ing a charge of playing loud music 
out his window. Later in his office 
he made no comment. 

David Bouvier, a gradu~te phi-
losophy student, spoke on the 
"wider issue." He asked "why 
can wee kill Vietnamese, but 
cannot engage in sexual con-
gress." He said that we should 
determine our own lives. He ~ believes the administration is 

I afraid of students becoming ma-
I ture. 

A list of demands was given 
I to Provost Paul Saltman, accor-
' ding to Moore. Included was an 
open hearing for conduct cases. 

The question of whether or not 
the Unlversity should be run 

J according to public opinion, since 
: it is supported primarily by the I public, was discussed. 
Some students presently think 
private universities, which rely 
heavily on private contributions, 
have more freedom than we do 
on UC campuses. 

Some graduate students said 
that much of what the committee 
was trying to do had been ac-
complished in the past. Organi-
zations, courts and committees 
had been formed but then for-
gotten. Therefore, the purpose 
of their efforts should be toform 
something tht w1lllast, they con-
cluded. 

Higher Fees Delayed 
As Chancellor Resigns 

The Regent's meeting in River-
side last weekend became em-
broiled in budget, enrollment and 
a resignation. Resolutions by 
student representatives and se-
veral regents added to the de-
liberations, with the governor and 
speaker of the Assembly on hand, 
as well. 

Because of the question of Gov. 
Reagan's 1968-1969 budget and its 
effect on UC operations ( see 
accompanying article), Regents 
Edwin A. Pauley and William M. 
Roth called for a study of the 
results that a restricted enroll-
ment would have on the University 
this coming academic year. 
Passed 16-4, the resolution sug-
gests that the same number of 
students now enrolled at the Uni-
vesity would be in effect next 
year. 

Assembly Speaker J esse Unruh 
voiced opposition to the s tudy 
because "the Board has seen 
enough s tUdies as it is. It is a 
dereliction of duty to stall any 
longer." He espressed the op-
inion that the Regents are with-
holding any action in order to 
play black jact with the Gov-
ernor." 

The resolution called for con-
tinuing the present "quality in 
teaching and research at the 
Univers ity ... , particularly as it 
might apply to the facuIty-student 
ratio." 

President Charles Hitch ex-
pressed his opinion that the 
/,obvious way to keep up quality 
1s to restrict enrollment," so 
that 6000-7000 students would be 
denied entrance into the Univer-
s ity in the Fall. 

Unr uh's resolution to postpone 
any raises in the Incidental Fees 
until 1969 was defeated as an 
alternative to Pauley's motion. 
Hitch said that a raise would 
be possible even after April, when 
the Higgs Special Committee on 
Student Charges was expected 
to finish its report. 

The present dealings, Unruh 
said, were "bringing a feeling 
of uncertainity and concern for 
what the futu re holds. The 
Regent's ought to provide great 
leadership. We need some action 
with finality now. The thing we 
need now is firm, positive 
reasons (for ou r stands)." 

UCSD To Get 2 Million 
Less In Reagan's Budget 

Regent Norton Simon said ther e 
was no excuse to higher fees, 
" which are a form of taxation, 
and I am thus in accord with 
the Governor on this point." 
Reagan had s tated that no new 
taxes would be levied this year, 
because of the increase of 1 
billion voted by the legislature 
last year. 

RESIG ATION OF MURPHY 
Again budget problems arose at 

the Regent' s meeting last week. 
President Hitch warned of reduc-
tion in quality in University oper-
ations and education because of 
the 10% cut in Regent's requests 
for fund from the Governor. Gov. 
Reagan countered with the fact 
that education was given highest 
priority in preparing the 1968-
1969 budget, and its increase 
over last year's allocation fol-
lowed previous rations of student 
enrollment to expenditures. 

UCSD will receive about $2 
million less in budget requests 
for non-constructional purposes, 
according to a report released' 
by the Chancellor's office. In 
the following report, excerpted 
from Dr. Galbrath's analysis of 
the Governor's budget, UCSD suf-
fers Significant and perhaps ir-

- severat"-importanCctiiillges in 
the educational policy and re-
quirements of UCSD have just 
been announced. The changes 
concern a pass-fail option, the 
upper division language require-
ments, and the Earth science 
major. 

Next quarter UCSD w1ll join 
seven other UC campuses in 
allowing students to take courses 
on a pass-fail basis. Only unit 
credit will be gIven for any 
class taken under this system. 
Students will be allowed to take 
up to 25% of their total work 
load on this basis . 

The educational policy com-
mittee of UCSD had approved the 
plan earlier, but had specified 
that "c" would be a passing 
grade, contrary to the UC-wide 
standards, which accept a "D" 
as passing. Approval was re-
ceived for this change. Five of 
the seven UC campuses do not 
accept a "0" and it appears

(From the Chancellor'scover-
ing letter to the report:) 

UCSD is at a cr ucial stage 
in its development. Several of its 
departments are currently too 
small to provide undergraduate 
instruction; other departments 
which are major elements in any 

f established univer s ity do not yet 
exist. We had hoped this year 
to begin instruction in Anthro-
pology, Sociology, and Drama, 
and to add staff to such infant 
departments as Visual Arts and 
Economics, as well as adding 
positions in other departments 
to provide for the 800 or so ad-
ditional students we expect next 
year. But UCSD's allocation from 
the Governor's budget would be 
15 positions for the general 
campus, exclusive of the Medical 
School, at an average level of 
assistant-professorship. It w1ll

The Regent's also accepted the

Chancellor of UC LA since 1960. 
Murphy is scheduled to join the

In his letter of resignation to 
President Hitch, Murphy said, 
"I am sure you will understand 
when I say that perhaps my ul-
timate satisfaction has been

colleagues, the faculty and the 
student leaders at UC LA as we

Guest Editorial 

Nlurphy Clarifies 
Nloore's Case 

Published and extemporaneous reports of the "Charlie Moore 
case" have elicited, over the past several days, genuine concern' 
for procedural fairness in campus disciplinary matters among many 
students. Because what is at stake here is of critical importance to 
UCSD it seems to be time to try to set the record straight -- to 
describe what has happened with Charlie Moore up to this point, to 
summarize existing campus disciplinary procedures and to outlIne 
the direction in which the "Moore case" is now going. 

Existing UCSD regulations, promulgated last year after extensive 
review and approval by students and student groups, authorize the Dean 
of Student Affairs or his representative to conduct the initial investiga-
tion ot all cases of alleged misconduct and, at his discretion, to Impose 
disciplinary actions less severe than suspension or dismissal from the 
University. These same regulations also provide for a number of 
procedural safeguards where disciplinary action may be taken, whether 
by a dean or by a student or student-faculty judicial committee: 

1. The student shall be presumed innocent until shown to the contrary. 
2. The student shall be entitled to a prompt and impartial hearingj 
3. He shall be entitled, in advance of such hearing, to a written 

statement indicating the alleged violation, together with references, 
the evidence against him, and its source(s)j 

4. The student shall be entitled, but not required, to have an adviser 
of his own choice; 

5. The student shall have every reasonable opportunity to present 
his case at the hearing, including the presentation of written and oral 
testimony by himself and by witnesses of his own choice. He shaU 
also have the right to address questions to any other witnesses at 
the hearing; 

6. He may decline to answer incriminating questions; 
7. A report of the hearing shall accompany the hearing agency's 

recommendations; a copy of this report and the recommendations shall 
be furnished to the student upon his request. Adequate time will be 
given to the student to present arguments against any adverse recom-
mendation which may be made; 

8. The student shall have the right to appeal; 
9. With the exception of the Chancellor, any administrative officer 

receiving and acting upon the recommendation of a judicial com-
mittee may accept or decrease the discipline proposed; in no case 
shall he increase the severity of the recommended disciplinary action. 

In the case at hand, there is an can be no real question that the 
safeguards deSignated as Ill, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 above were honored 
or were not calIed into play by Mr. Moore. Nor can there be any doubt 
that Dean Hull was dead wrong in denying to Mr. Moore an appeal of 
the eviction (#8). As important as this error, however, is the fact 
that the disciplinary process itself provides the means for rapidly 
correcting both arbitrary actions and honest mistakes. At 9:00 a.m. 
the following morning, I officially informed Mr. Moore that he could, 
indeed, appeal Dean Hull's decision to Provost Saltman (Mr. Moore 
assured me he had known it all along). 

On February 13, Mr. Moore was asked to come to Dean HuU's office 
to discuss six (not three) apparent violations of campus-wide and 
Revelle residence hall regulations. Accompanied by his advisor, Mr. 
Willie Brandt, currently enrolled as a sophomore at Berkeley, Mr. 
Moore kept the appointment. Dean Hull olally described to him the 
alleged violations, some of which Dean Hull had personally observed 
and the balance of which had been reported by other members of the 
University community. Without exception, Mr. Moore acknowledged the 
accuracy of the reports and admitted that he had, indeed, violated 
the relevant campus and college rules. In light of Mr. Moore's prior 
conduct, also admitted by him, his apparent continued disregard for 
those regulations with which he disagreed, and the probability that 
his behavior was likely to show no significant shift in the immediate 
future, Dean Hull, acting in accord with the terms of the residence 
contract, gave him forty-eight hours to move from the Revelle halls. 
And Dean Hull erroneously Informed Mr. Moore that the eviction 
action could not be appealed. 

The point has also been raised that no written statement of the 
alleged violations was ever given Mr. Moore (see #3 above). It seems 
to me clear that, in the face of Mr. Moore's voluntary admission 
that the allegations were completely accurate, it would have been 
pointless to go through the motions of reducing them to writing. The 
facts were not at issue, the violations were readlly acknowledged and 
the sources were not challenged. No threat to Mr. Moore's right to a 
fair hearing existed. 

On February ~5, Mr. Moore and his advisor met with Provost 
Saltman and req'Jested additional time to prepare an appeal. Dr. 
Saltman asked ~!r . Moore lf he could be expected to comply with 
campus regulatlGas while the appeal was pendingj although Mr. 
Moore was initia:ly uncertain that he could give any such assurances, 
he eventually agr ~ed to do so. In light tof his pattern of conduct up to 
that point, Dr. ~;altman asked him if he would sign a short, direct 
statement to thi£ effect and Mr. Moor~, upon th~ <;ugllestion of his 
adviser, refused He stated that he wished to discuss the matter 
with an attorney, agreed to inform Provost Saltman ot his intentions 
before the aftern lOll was out and and left the Provost's office. Despite 
his agreement, there has been no further contact between the Provost 
and Mr. Moore. 

Where does the matter now stand? Mr. Moore has refused to exercise 
his right to appeal. Additional violations of campus regulations have, 
it appears, occurred on his part. As a consequence, the evidence, in; 
its entlrety, has been submitted to the student-facuIty Committee on' 
Student Conduct and Affairs which will hear the case next Tuesday. 
Mr. Moore has been reminded of those procedural safeguards guaran-
teed him in our regulations and, to the extent they call for administrative 
initiative, they have been satisfied in full. I would suggest that that 
Committee be permitted now to judge the evidence, all of it, and to 
form its own conclusions. Mr. Moore's rights have been and wlll be 
preserved.

Money or Mouth --
That Is the Question 
The University is and should be the center for student dissent, 

an open market of free speech and the exchange of ideas. This Wal-
halla for the misbegotten, however, wlll have to decided to what extent 
this free exchange can stretch out its mit to catch the pennies which 
would otherwise flow into the UCSD purse. 

Each year these pennies add up to the tune of one mUlion dollars 
in private donations and corporation grants for UCSD. Were we to lose 
these funds, the chance of higher fees and reduced free speech would 
be our only gain. While dissent may not be the cause of such a situation, 
exhibitions of polltical theatrics might well be. 

No matter how we may want to view the facts, the University is 
supported by local and state taxpayers and private donations. To ignore 
these people while In the pursuit of politcal truth is to accept a position 
out of reality. Their dollars make political actisism on this campus 
possible, to feel absolutely no responslbl1tytowards them is certainly not 
reasonable. 

While the Triton Times is not against studentacitivism and responsible 
presentation of student views and discontent, we feel it our responsibility 
to warn those forms of student protest which strive to be as different 
as possible from their forerunners that their actions may greatly 
damage UCSO's prestige and picket. The question is whether these 
demonstrations, though expressions of free speech, are worth the loss 
of public confidence in the University , so desperately needed this year.

IA'etters ,to 
the Editor 
Editor, Triton Times 

Your editorial in the February 
9 issue of the Triton Times 
raises several basic and critical 
questions in my mind. You state 
how the A.S. Senate has failed 
the needs of the students. I claim 
that the students of UCSD hav~ 
failed the needs of the senate. 

The students on this campus 
are expected to be mature, intel-
ligent individuals who do Il'li 
'1.3 1j '}.II:', ~ma1ds to tell them what

sons to serve or head committees 
which should be of vital interest 
to tbemselves. Respo'1S\! bas been 
almost oon-existant. 

You censure us for discrimi-
nation in funding. On the con-
trary, 1 feel we have used dis-
cretion in thost! r{)TH'~':; .>~,~. 

.,~o~ed to us. We feel rnat m?:lilY 
!!Jnded by the A.S shout,] :)13 of 
beneflt to a majority of students 
(either educationally or enter-
taining). Why has not Muir re- , 
quested funds for activities spon-
sored by Muir, but in actuality 
open to students of Revelle as 
well? Also, if Muir feels that 
they should have money solely 
for Muir activities, why have 
they not debated this policy with 
the senate? Instead they meekly 
accept a "Pay as you go basis." 

You also say "If their aca-
demic schedules interfere with 
their I:!ffectiveness, they should 
not run for office." If the A.S. 
Senate were to perform all olthe 
duties you suggest, then I seri-
ously doubt that anyone ' on this 
campus could hold ottice and 
maintain his classes. 

I ail'ee that the constitution 
needs amending, so why don't 
interested students call . a Con-
stltJtlonal Convention? In short, 
I even question that the students 
deserve an active senate! When 
in UCSD's history has tile re beea 
regular, 1iversified entertain. 
ment, tree to students? When have 
students had available regular . 
questionaires to elucidat'l ~h~lr 
com ments and complaints to their 
representatives? When has the 
student government at UCSD ad-
dressed itself to controversial 
poUlical issues? The answer 
only under the present student 
administration! Have we really 
failed the students?

WarGames 
Wins Big 

The battle of the Western 
Pacific was fought on the night of 
Friday, January 26 in the South 
Dining Hall. It was the UCSD War 
Games Society's largest battle 
yet in the Anglo-American War 
of 1926. It was the culmination 
of a series of naval engagements 
in the Pacificj all told, sixty-
seven ships entered the battle. 

Both sides employed carriers 
for the first time and flew air 
missions prior to the closing of 
the fleets. American fighter 
planes swept most of the British 
aircraft from the air before they 
reached the Yankee neet, but the 
few bombers that got through sank 
a destroyed and damaged the 
battleship 'Idaho' with an aerial 
torpedo. Meanwhile British anti-
aircraft fire brought down more 
than its share of American 
bombers and only two old battle-
ships received damage. 

The Americans prevailed in the 
naval battle. Arrayed in straight-
line formation, they ralced the 
classical U - shaped pattern of the 
British vessels. Particularly 
frustrating for the British was 
their awkward attempt to wheel 
around and join the battle at 
closer range. . 

Their four big Invincible-class 
battle-cruisers, boasting sixteen 
inch guns, especially faced this 
problem as the Yankee echelon 
headed for the opposite sIde of 
the U. Because of their superior 
firepower and tactical formation, 
the Americans gained an edge at 
the outset which they never re-
linquished. 

Alter about five hours of play, 
the British began to withdraw--
but not until the battlecruiser 
'Inflexible' was sunk and the 
'Hood', of the same squadron, 
was limping at not quite half 
speed. Also, the two old battle-
ships damaged by bombs in the 
aerial attack were sunk; these 
had been positioned on the wing 
of the U which the Amer icans 
new over. 

In return, however, the British 
sanlt the battleship • Arizona' 
(fate!) and nearly sank its com-
panion, the 'Pennsylvania'. But 
more damage to Ugllter ships was 
suffered by the British, who, tor 
instance, lost tbeir two neet 
cruisers. All in all, 11 was cal-
culated that the Americans In-
mcted one-sixth more damage 
than the BritIsh--a result of their

Soaring

Explained 

23 FEBRUARY 1968 PAGE. 

Tbermal Souing - The most 
common type of soaring in the 
United states Is thermal nying. 
Thermals are rising columns 
of warm air, and can be detected 
visually by observing cumulus 
clouds which sometimes form 
at the top of the termal or by 
noUng "dust devils" (minlsture 
Whirlwinds) which give the loca-
tion of the base of the thermal. 
Usually, however, the ter mal 
cannot be detected by Sight, and 
a sailplane pilot must exercise 
cons ide rable skill in locating the 
thermal. The pilot gains altitude 
by spiralling within the rising 
column of air. Rates of climb 
of 1,000 feet pe r minute are not 
uncommon in ther mal flying 
Cross- country soaring is ac-
complished by gaining altitude 
in the thermal, then gliding in 
the direction desired until an-
other thermal is found, where 
the lost altitude is regained. 

Ridge Soaring - Ridge soaring, 
as demonstrated here at Torrey 
Pines, was the first type of 
soaring to be discoverea ana 
practiced. It is the most prevalent 
type of soaring in mountainuous 
European countries, where steep 
slopes are plentuul. 10 providing 
r idge soaring, surface winds 
blowing against the face of a cUff 
or s teep slope are deflected up-
ward by the slope. Sailpanes 
nying in this updraft are able 
to s tay aloft because their low 
sinking speed is less than the 
ve r tical speed of the rising air 
cur rents. 

Wave Soaring - Wave soaring 
Is perhaps the most spectacular 
type of soaring. Waves from in 
the lee ridges and the mountain 
ranges dur ing periods of high 
rising air currents up to many 
times the height 0; the terrain 
caus ing the condition. Weak wave 
have been known to form 
at Elsinore and Borrego in 
Sounthern California. The most 
famous was condition is the 
one which develops at Bishop, 
California, in the Sierras. 
Altitudes above 40,000 feet have 
been reached in this wave, to 
set new records. 

At Torrey Pines , the ground 
operations , as performed by the 
appropriateiy named ground crew, 
are quite simple. There are 
basically four people involved, 
not including the pilot, of course. 
The first person runs the winch. 
He sits all by himseU down next 

' to the edge of the clill and winds 
in the cable with the glider on 
thn end at anywhere from 55 to 
70 miles per hour. In the event

Heads Club 
This year, beyond providing 

the Torrey Pines Glid,!rport, the 
University of Californ.a, San Di-
ego campus has projuced our 
soaring Queen, Pamela Coker, a 
sophomore at UCSD s Revelle 
College. 

Pam was introduce!! to soaring 
in 1966 when she too!. her first 
powerless night at Tehachapi, 
California. Since her arrivai at 
UCSD s he has been a frequent 
':" \ght here at Torrey rines. 
Though enrolled as a Mathe-
matics major she still finds time 
to polish her skills as a glider 
pilot by receiving fiight instruc-
tion at this unique soaring site. 

Since she is a member of both 
the Associated Gilder Clubs of 
Southern California , and the 
UCSD Soarlng Club, It is ap-
propr1ate that she present the 
JOM J. Montgomery Memor ial 
Trophy to the champIon of this

of an aero-tew instead of a winch 
tow this person nies the tow 
plane. The second job is that of 
flagman. He communicates to the 
winch operator, through the use 
of a flag, when the gilder is 
ready to fly. The third andfourtb 
posiUons are held by crew mem-
bers holdlng the sailplane in 
position for take off. One holds 
the wing, and the other holds 
the tail until the glider is going 
fast enough so that it wUl 
stabilize ItseU. Basi~ally that's 
it, however there is one more 
job which is nice to have done. 
This is to have someone tow 
the cable back up to the end 
of the runway from the winch 
truck---the sailplane won't go 
too far without a cable to pull 
it.

Pacific Coast Mid-Winter Soar-

Callfornia and immediately south 
of the Torrey Pines Gall Course.

The Torrey Pines Meet wlll 

feature several added attrac-
tions. The most outstanding of 
these w1ll be the aerobatics de-
monstration performed by a two-
place high perfor mance sail-
plane. Dur ing the demonstration 
the pilot will nar rate as he files 
exactly what maneuver he is 
executing. This will be relayed 
via radio and P.A. system to the 
spectators on the ground below. 

This year's meet w1ll also 
feature the widest and most in-
teresting collection of soar ing 
craft ever assembled at Torrey 
Pines. Among the pilots of these 
ships will be several wor ld- re-
cord holders in the spor t of 
soaring. This is the only spec-
tator- oriented soaring meet in 
the United States. This is due to 
the fac t that the motorless craft 
are restricted to nying the ridge-
lift of the cliffs over- looking La 
Jolla Cove. 

The sponsors of this year 's 
meet are the UCSD Soaring Club 
and the Associated Glider Clubs 
01 Southern California. We hope 
that the 24th and 25th will prove 
to be the most interesting and 
exciting weekend l or soaringthat 
San Diego bas ever witnessed. 

Long before man learned to 
harness power for flight, he ex-
perimented in many ways with 
gliding. Here, in a few hundred 
words, we 'll attempt to cover 
a few thousand years of progress 
in man's conquest of the air, 
and to afford a glance at the 
events that have led us to Torrey 
Pines for this annual soaring 
event. 

Stories of various attempts at 
flight go back thousands of years 
with the most popular being the 
episode of Daedalus and his son 
Icarus who together ned by air 
from the imprisonment of King 
Minos of Crete. Though such a 
flight was quite an achievement 
Icarus was pltilully unfamiliar 
with his new-found realm of llIght 
and ventured too high, indeed. so 
high that the sun soon melted 
the wax that bound his wings 
together , thereby causing the 
first case of inflight st ructural 
failure and subsequent disaster . 
(This is not verUied by F.A.A 
records, so the reader must 
decide as to the accuracy of the 
incident.) However, Daedalus 
somehow managed to continue 
his flight and is said to have 
landed safely, thereby estab-
lishing a remarkable 50 per cent

AUIO lOW 

The record falled to Improve 
for a long time. During the 
thousand years preceeding the 
birth of Christ, adventurous men 
are said to have attempted gliding 
by leaping from high places with 
wings of varying design attached 
to their arms. One such flight , 
among the earliest recorded was 
that of an Engllsh monk in i020 
A.D. Oliver Maimesbury dived 
from a tower using a flapping 
wing device which failed miser-
ably, and OLiver crashed to the 
ground sustaining severe injury. 
Many others followed his example 
in those precarious ear Iy Clays of 
" flight" . 

MORE 'WINGS' 
The flapping wing, in Imitation 

of the birds, was long thought 
to be the key to success. It was 
Leonardo da Vinci who finally 
suggested that this techinque was 
insufficient to produce flight, 
and this discovery was eventually 
to lead man to more practical 
means. 

Years passed before gliding 
became an important method of 
becoming airborne. Man dis-
covered ballooning in the interim 
(about 1650) and an airship was 
designed in 1670 but never flew.

The first balloon to fly was 
a hot air job invented by two 
French brothers named Joseph 
and Etienne Montgolgier on June 
5, 1783. A cross - channel (Eng-
land) night was accomplished 
in a ballon on January 7, 1785. 

The first flight of an actual 
glider was performed by a Jesuit 
Father near Lisbon in 1709. It 
was tiny, but it Is said to have 
nown and so, with its fixed wing 
design It was a very important 
step in the r ight direction. 

A WORKING MODEL 

Probably the first important 
person who worked directly with 
gilders was Sir George Cayley. 
After careful study of various 
sorts of kites, Sir George devised 
a gilder which new quite suces-
sfully in 1799; it was a moael 
of a larlte glider which he hoped 
one day to build and fly. Having' 
learned many important facts of 
aeronautics Cayley did indeed 
bulld a full scale gilder within 
5 years and allowed small boys 
to glide down a hUiside near 
his home. In 1849 he built a 
remarkable trl-winged gUder de-
signed to accommodate a pilot, 
thus marking a giant mllestone 
in aviation history. His machine 
probably could have carried a 
full sized man but seems to have 
been nown by boys only. An Im-
proved version, however, flew in 
1853, carying Sir George's 
coachman (who bad been volun-
teered for the task by Caley 
and soon after ward offered his 
resignation). Thus, Sir George 
Cayley became the inventor of 
the airplane. 

A nying machine of some 
practical value had at last been 
invented. Cayley was now a very 
old man but a young German 
came along to taKe over wnere 
Sir George had left off. Over a 
period of six years Otto 
Lilienthal new his hand gliders 
thousands ot times, gradually 
improving the desiiD and 
technique untu mghts of as much 
a ,e; 750 feet were attained. His 
hand gliders were comprised of 
two winKS mounted one abOve 
the other and a tail section 
slm1I1ar in appearance to those 
found on modern aircraft. When 
the pUot desired to fly, he simply 
picked up the device, he Id It in 
his hands above his head and 
bepn to run quite briskly until 
sufficient lift was achieved; at 
this point the contraotlon would 
rise and there you were, flyingl

History 
CONT'D FROM PAGE FOUR 

Once airborne, however, contrOL 
of the craft depended upon the 
shifting of body weight. Consider-
able skill must have been re-
quired to get safely back on the 
ground and Lllienthal seemed 
to do very well. After contrib-
uting much to the knowledge of 
flight, Otto lost control ot his 
hand held gIlder in August of 
1896 and crashed. He died soon 
after. 

FmST FLIGHT IN SANOIEGO 
In 1883 Geor~ Montgomery 

devised a unique method of fllght 
which he demonstrated here in 
san Diego. A crude two winged 
glider was attached to a balloon 
and carried aloft, with Mont-
gomery aboard, to a height of 
3,000 feet. The line was cut and 
the glider made a safe landing, 
thereby establishing Montgomery 
as the first person to achieve 
true nliht as we know it today. 
His glider may be seen today 
at the San DieltO Aerosoace 
Museum along with other infor-
mation concerning the fllght. It 
·is sad that this pioneer has so 
far received little international 
recognition for his accompUsh-
ments. 

TIME ALOFT LIMITED 

deScribed as thrUlIDc. It must 
have been very d1ff1cult to move 
one's feet at a speed cooslstent 
with the speed of the sircraft 
in order to assure that the land-
ing be made in upright position. 
Mostly tbev weren't, as Mr. 
Essery put it, "Every landing was 
a cnsh landingl" 

Mr. Essery was ready and 
willing to try it (or the first 
time hlmseU. At Clarke Lake, 
near Borrego Springs, thermal 
nying was discovered in the West 
by Mr. Essery in 1938. "That 
first thermal was a real shock! II , 
recalls Alan. Thermal flYing 
had been discovered in the West 
and soaring was really on its way. 

The UCSD Soaring Club has a 
special request of those Univer-
sity studenis who own cars. We 
need the East side of North 
Torrey Pines Road fllled with 
cars. otherwise we could lose up 
to 50% ot our potential income 
parking -- thus no glider. So, 
U you can, it would really be 
a boost to see your car ' out 
there. Thanks.

TORREY PINES 
GLIDER PORT 

23 FEBRUARY 1968 PAGE 

Members of UCSD's Soaring Club use " horse" power to launch a glider from the field at Torrey 
- I 

Pines. When a winch is used the gUder takes off over the cliffs towards the Pacific Ocean. 

Prior to 1938, soaring In this 
country was limited to flying 
from clUls such as here at 
Torrey Pines, or from hWslaes 
such as Soledad. You got air-
borne by a car tow, or by being 
pulled down the side of a hill 
or if you were really lucky you 
simply hand-launched by being 
dropped off the edge of a cliff. 
A good filght lasteci- eight or 
ten seconds. 

Soaring Club Growing Despite Obstades 

Of course there were excep-
tions. One such flight lasted 15 
hours over Point Lorna. Strong 
winds were responsible for the 
great duration. In fact, the winds 
were so strong that the glider 
remained aloft with absoluteiy 
no ground speed, and the pilot 
was able to converse with the 
crowd assembled on the ground 
below. He would hover lllce a 
sUe nt hel1ocopter just above the 
ground and discuss the situation 
until someone reminded him that 
he was trying to break a record, 
at which point he would pull 
back on the sUck and rise 
straight up to a height several 
hundred feet until he again felt 
lone Iy and wanted to talk. 

ESSERY 'GUIDING HAND-
Mr. Al Essery of San Diego 
designed and bunt many hand 
gIlders 01 the type used so suc-
cessfully by otto Lllienthal. He 
described to us the great thrill 
of running along an suddenly 
lee ling the lift of the wings 
pulling you from the ground. 
The landing , however, seemed 
to us to be quite an experience too, 
though it '!lay perhaps be best 

$ e a • IS e _ Hi £!i 

The UCSD Soaring Club was 
formed this last fall by two stu-
dents, Robert Gentry (a sopho-
more) and Craig Maudlin (a jun-
ior). Both wll re glider pilots in 
the Assoc1ated Gilder Clubs of 
Southern CalUornia. At the first 
meeting of the club over seventy 
me mbers of the UCSDcommunity 
attended. The club then sought 
the aid and advice of the As-
soc1ated GIlder Clubs of Southern 
CalUornla. In response to this 
request the UCSD club was of-
fered the co-sponsorship of the 
22nd Annual Pacillc Coast Mid-
winter Soaring Championships. 
The San Diego club felt that 
since the UCSD club is a fellow 
soaring club and Is part of the 
University of CalUornla, which 
currently owns the gllderport, 
it would be desirable ~o offer the 
UCSD club the co-sponsorship. 

The UCSD club was formed 
with two goals. The most far-
reaching aim of the club is to 
get the present owners of the 
Torrey Pines Gllderport, toper-
manently designate it as a soar-
ing site. Under its present status 
the gliderport could be closed on 
a day's notice, although this is 
becoming a rapidly diminishing 
possibility. San Diego was the 
site of a great deal of early 
American soaring activity. Out 
of a number of sites (including 
Point Lorna, Mount Soledad, Mis-
sion Hills and Pacillc Beach) 

Plane tOWlnl (a take-oft method) lUls a ,Uder to the freedom of the skys. 

Torrey Pines is the only one 
left. In view of Its unique quali-
ties as a gUderport, with the 
prevailing west wind and ideal 
landing area of the beach belOW, 
and of its long and illustrious 
history (it was fir s t dedicated as 
a gllderport In 1939) the Torrey 
Pines GIlderport represents an 
integral part of the fiying heri-
tage of San Diego. 

The second goal of the club 
is to provide for the means to 
participate in this highly fuUUling 
sport all member s of the UCSD 
community at a reasonable cost. 
Most students do not have the 
monetary resources to partici-
pate in this sport. The UCSD 
club hopes to provide the means 
to experience this sport on the 
basis of interest and club par-
ticipation rather than on financial 
resources. 

The club is one of the most 
active on the UC campus . In 
following with the sp1tit of the 
club it has entitled its five to 
ten page monthly newsletter 
" Lift's Up". 10 its publication, 
the Soaring club features cur-
rent club news, an agenda, and 
stories on the sport of soaring. 
They hold monthly general mem-
bership meetings, featuring films 
and talks by distinguished local 
soaring pllots. As a means ot 
announcing a meeting last quarter 
they assembled a private glider 
in the middle of the campus. 
Last quarter the club arranged 
to have its members take intro-
ductory rides in a glider owned 
by the San Diego Club. They have 
Instituted a ground school, now 
being held on a bi-weekly basis. 

In addition to Its regular activi-
ties, the club is putting in a great 
deal ot time and effort to or-
ganize the Torrey Pines Meet, 
to be held Februuy 24 and 25. 
This years' meet program will 
feature four times as many pages 

J packed with lIturature and infor-
mation both on the sport of soar-
ing and the Torrey Pines meet. 
Because 01 the extensive co-
operation of the City and the Urn-
versity of California they hope 
to eliminate the extreme traffic 
conaestion ot Dast vears ' meets . 

In addition to las t years tro-
pbies for the events of duration, 
bomb drop, cross-country, spot 
landing and altitude there wlll be 
a new tropby sponsored by Olay 
Aircraft for the bighest scorin, 
san D1egan entrant. Also featured 
in this vear' s meet wlIl be acro-
batic demonstrations. Thg pllot 

flying the sailplane will narrate 
to the spectators v1a radio and 
the PA system exactly what his 
maneuvers are as he performs 
them. Approximately 25 to 30 
top Southern CalifornIa soaring 
pilots will be competing. Some 
outstanding sailplanes will be 
flown in competition off the cliffs 
of Torrey. Last year s meet saw 
some outstanding cliff soaring 
perfor med 

The club has experienced frus-
tration as well as success. Out 
of six attempts only one and 
one-hall introductory night oper-
ations succeeded owing to the 
tricky fall weather and aneccen-

tr ic winch truck. Another time 
the films which were ordered 
for a general membership meet- I 
ing did not arrive in time. How-
ever, compared with the success 
and unexpected help from such 
organizations as the Associated 
Glider Clubs of Southern Cali-
fornia and the UnlversityofCall-
forn1a, the spirit of optimism 
and confidence which has ear-
marked this group from Its con-
ception these setbacks are small 
indeed. The spirit of optimism 
and confidence which bas ear-
marked this group from its con-
ception is renected in it re-
markable growth.

INTRAMURAL· BAS.KElBALL INTO 
CHAMPIONSHI'P TOURNAMENT 

Can the NADS do it? The fact is no, as the 1968 intramural basketball 
championships got underway on the Revelle and Muir college courts. 
Notorious (or their (ouling ability, the NADS were just one of some 
22 teams in this year's competition. 

Yac hting Meet; 
Rei neman Scores 1 s t 

Balboa Yacht Club in Newport 
was the scene of the third meet 
in the Southern Series for UCSD's 
salling team. The regatta was 
bosted by Occidental College. 
Skippers Ken Holmes, Rich Rein-
eman and Steve Stasor brought 
UCSD a fourth place overall aided 
by Crews Chris Pendleton and 
Pat Shoemaker. Twelve schools 
participated in the regatta in-
cluding four UC campuses as we 11 
"05 other colleges and universities 
fn Southern California. 
. First place went to USC, with 
sacond and third places going 
to San Diego state and UC LA 
respectively. UCLA went so far 
as to celebrate their success 
by capSizing at the dock at the 
end of the day. 

The seventh race of the day 
proved to be a bit trying for near-
ly half of the bOats. All rounded 
the first mark without any troub-
le, but the weather mark wasmore 
of a challenge. By the time the 
last half of the boats got half-way 
to the weather mark, the wind 
!la(I reduced itself to nothing and 
the current was so st rong, that 
the boats were moving backwards 
faster than they were salling for-
'Nard. As a result, five of the 
twe lve boats did not round the 
weather mark and paddled to the 
finish line. The wind picked up 
again shortly arter that and the 

last race of the day was sailed 
Successfully with UCSO's Rich 
Reinman leading the neet for a 
first. 

4 UCSD Students 
In Tennis Tourney 

4 people, two men and two 
women, have been selected to 
represent UCSD in the Arizona 
Invitational Tennis Tourney held 
at Tucson this weekend. 

John Sanage, Steve Terre, 
Laurie Liswood, and Cathy Abade 
were the top players in elimina-
tion play. The two men were 
se lected in this way from the in-
tercollegiate tennis squad, while 
the girls df!feated all opponents 
in a women's elimination tour-
nament. 

This is the first time that UCSD 
has sent representatives to the 
Invitational, and their chances 
look good for fine placings In 
the tournament. Play started to-
day and will continue through 
Sunday. 

RUGBY ACTION , 
This Saturday, the UCSD Tritons 

host San Fernando Valley State 
in an intercollegiate contest at 
2: 00 pm. Of the remaining 5 
games, 3 will be played on the 
home field, all on Saturdatafter-
noons. Future opponents include 
San Diego state, UCLA, Cal Tech 
(there), and UC Irvine . Get out 
and see the action! 

The Intramural Basketball 
Championship and Consolation 
Tournaments got underway last 
Thursday with the Purple Go-
phers off to a surprising 1st 
quarter. 

After trailing 16-1 after the 
tirst quarter, the Purple Gophers 
went into a man to man press 
and cut Kappa Sig's lead to 18-15 
at the half. The second half saw 
Dan Christinaz controlling the 
boards and Tom Bird doing the 
scoring to pull the Gophers to 
victory. Gary Curtis ptayed his 
best game to date for Kappa Sig. 
Final score: Gophers 42, Kappa 
Sig 35. 

Ball Behrings 46-Basket Wea-
vers 21: With Greg Bullock (16 
pts.) and Erick Hybertson (14) 
leading the way, the Ball Behrings 
easily outplayed the Basket Wea-
vers, holding usually high-scor-
ing Gary Carroll to just 6. Fine 
defense and explosive offense 
were shown by the Ball Behrings 
in this team effort. 

Ogden Hall 56-Orange Shirts 
19: The Orange Shirts were never 
in the game as Ogden dominated 
play from the opening whistle. 
B. Merrill (14 pts.), S. Bailey and 
R. Andrew (10 each) led Ogden to 
the second level of the playoffs. 
Ogden showed a great deal of 
depth and all nine men played 
well. 

NADS Win !!!!! 
Nads 29, B.F.K. 27: The 

thundering herd of orange NADS 
won their first game of the season 
over B.F.K. by one thin basket. 
The key baskets were sunk by 
'Heavy' Palcik and 'Black Bart' 
Horwitz as the Nads set their 
sights on the consolation cham-
pionship. 

The D.B.s took the Behemoths 
40-32 in a closely contended 
battle with Steve Nogao making 
the best showing of the game with 
12 points. 

The Old Men ran over Beagle 
ITCH 46-25 with H. Lipinski 
giving a fine display of talent 
to pick up 21 points plus support 
from quick delenseman D. Sie-
mon with 17 pts. 

The Purple Gophers advanced 
into the tournament of champions 
during Wednesday's play by 
thrashing the Defending cham-
pions, Old Men, 48-36. Gopher 
coach John Thomas stacked his 
defense to stop 6'8" center Hu-
bert Lipinski and forward Dicit 
Seimen, who is the Men's top 
outside shooter, with enough suc-
cess to secure the victory. For-
wards Arter and Borth banged in 
15 and 14 points respectively for 
the winners. 

Grin and Bear It advanced in 
the consolatlon bracket Wednes-
day by edging Argo IV 43-36. 
The winner's big men were the 
difference , as forwards Brown 
and Turner chipped in 13 pOints 
apiece while doing a fine job 
on the boards. The loser's de-
Munck was top scorer with 15. 

The But-Fakes, under the 
heavy hand of Sundstrom with 21 
points, left the Ball Behrings 
defenseless as they handed them 
a 57-22 defeat. McCormic with 
11 and Cox with 9 followed Sund-
strom in scoring for the But-
Fakes. Hybertsen was high man 
for Behrings with 14. 

CHAVEZ LEADS PANTHERS 
Defense and good board worlc 

helped the Chern-wipes overcome 
the Panthers 47-32. Christian 
(or the Chern-wipes had a good 
game and held high pt. honors 
with 16. Chavez led the Pan-
thers with 15. Deutsch with 11, 
Rabinowitz with 7, and Native 
with 6 helped the Wipes to vic-
tory. Spriggs with 8 and Myers 
with 7 followed the scoring for 
the Panthers. 

Surprising Ogden Hall ad-
vanced in the tournament of 
Champs Wednesday by knocking 
off B League champion E. B. 
Scripps bya 39-29 count. Scripp's 
Terry Parr was the game's out-
standing player as he rebounded 
well and shot for 16 points, but a 
balanced scoring attack coupled 
with the winner's successful as-
sault on both backboards was the 
difference. 

Heferees Paul Kanter and Mar-
ti Finkler held the rough and 

ready NAnS to 21 personal fouls, 
as they were dropped by Argo 
IV Seamen 36-17. Tough luck 
NAnS! 

The Ellen Browning Scripps 
Roundball Association rebounded 
from ignomonious defeat to 
roundly trounce the Beagle ITCH 
56-39, ending the Beagle's reach 
for the Championship in the 2nd 
round. The battling biologists 
were led by Parr and Fong with 
19' and 15 points, respectively. 
Pucci and Whart leave Beagles 
with 11 and 8. The tirst half 
was notable for the gentlemanly 
behavior of the players, but the 
second half saw a return to nor-
malcy. 

B.F.K. 39-0gden 36: Thegame 
was closely fought, but Ogden 
couldn't keep the pace. McCormik 
played well in both ends of the 
court and was high scorer on the 
team with 11 points. Sundstrom 
played well on defense for BFK, 
and finished with 9. Bailey for 
Ogden was high point man, taking 
7 points of his 13 total on free 
throws. Thompson with a good 
outside hand scored 9. 

Another action packed game 
came to pass as the fabulous 
D.B.s met the BOl in what proved 
to be a one-way battle. The game 
was close at the end of the 1st 
quarter; 15-11, but from then on 
the speed of BOl made the dif-
ference as they came out on top 
46-48. Poolman of BOl was high 
for the game with 12 points; 
Herschman had II for the D.B.s. 

SATURDAY'S PLAY 
Saturday's tournament play 

saw Kappa Sig pick up a win 
by a forfeit over the Orange 
Shirts. The NADS, striving for a 
new image, fell before the At-
lantis Animals 44-33. A record 
of sorts was set by Tom Bakei' 
as he only collected two fouls 
and fell fUrther behind Pete "gol-
den arm" Kane who again col-
lected 5 to pad his lead in most 
fouls for the season. Hyde and 
Palcic took up some of the s lack 
with 5 fouls each as the Nads 
only collected 22. Gushwas tried 
valiantly to carry the Nads with 
his 11 pts. , but the effort was in 
vain. cont'd on page seven 

Tritons End Season Against South Koreans 
Tuesday evening the Triton 

cagers lost the first of their 
last three season contests to 
C.ili.fornla Baptist College at Ri-
verside. Playing in spurts, the 
Tritons could not overcome the 
eleven point lead the Lancers had 
acquired, and at the final the 
score was Cal Baptist 78, UCSD

Of Tracie S,uad 

Coach Rich Johnson, assisted 
by Bob Wilson, have welcomed 
32 athletes to workouts in prep-
aration for UCSO's 3rd season 
of intercollegiate track. 

The Tritons first meet is to-
morrow afternoon at the AU-
comers meet hosted by Chapman 
College of Orange, California. 
The nucleus of the team this year 
is made up of returning letterman 
from the last two years. 

Heading up the returnees is Cap-
tain Dave Kuhn in the sprints, and 
weight man Roy Dimon. Phil Cun-
ningham and Tom Wollf are wel-
come sights in the short sprints 
with Marc Rothman and Joe Mc 
Carthy returning to run that 
grueling 440 yd dash. 
Bill Dower will again compete 

in the pole vault (between labs!) 
AND Warren Kumley wlll find a 
spot in any event from the half-
mile on up. 
New commers to the squad in-

clude cross country phenom Jay 
Segal,and a pole vaulter to back 
up Dower in Bruce Burdick. 

Wolff will also see action in the 
long jump with Jerry Niergarten, 
but will have to do without Bob 
Nasset, lost to academic aU-
ments. It is hoped that some of 
the new men can fill the spot. 

UCSO will host the first borne 
track meet in the schools his-
tory on March 1 in a triangu-
lar meet against UC Riverslde 
and Cal Western. New equipment 
should be here by then, and the 
team is anticipating their home 
debut. 

SOCCER PLAY 
Soccer action resumes Sunday 
at high noon on the UCSD cam-
pus as the Triton Soccer Club 
takes on the German Americans 
of th e San Diego Soccer League. 

The Club narrowly lost in their 
last outlng, 8-5 againstthe Inter-
nationals. This is the most points 
scored agalnst both teams this 
season, and especially notable is 
the UC effort since in all pre-
vious outings the total points that 
have been scored against the In-
ternationals had been 18. The 
Internationals are leading the 
league. 
The Tritons will be up for the 

game Sunday, coming from an 
unofficial scrimmage defeat of 
the powerful San Diego State ele-
ven, 6-1, which borders on hu-
miUation. The Germans are about 
6th in league and should pose 
little proble m to the rapidly im-
proving and powerful Tritons. 

Becasuse Ucsd ls hosting the 
match, only the second to be 
held on our campus, UCSD stu-
dents are urged to come out 
and see what Is going on.

The UCSD 1967-68 intercollegiate wrestllng team. Coach Mlllenbah, kneeling on the left, had nothing 
but praise for this year's performance by the squad. Bo!:> Wilson, UCSD's champion at the recent 
Biola. Invitational, wUl reprsent the school along with a teammate at the NAIA regional wrestling 
tournament in Claremont, Calif. this weekend. 

IIIREITIERI Ell" "DI 'EAIIN 
An outstanding job by all, was 

the way wrestling coach Chuclc 
M1llenbah described his squad's 
effort this last weekend in the 
BIola Invitational Wrestling 
Tournament. 

UCSD finished 7th of 16 teams, 
and considering that we have us-
ually finished near the bottom 
before this year, this is excel-
lent. 

Millenbah could not say enough 
about the phenomenal perform-
ance of freshman grappler Bob 
Wilson, completing in the 130 lb. 
ciass. Wilson ended up the meet 
champion in that class, and will 
go on to represent UCSD at the 
NAIA District Jl[ wrestlingtourn-
ament held today and tomorrow 
at Pomona College inClaremont, 
California. 

Along with wllson wlll go one 
of UCSO's top men of all year, 
Phll Costello. "Both these men 
have a real chance to make it 

Disco Dance, Mar. 2 

to the NAIA national finals in 
Colorado," Millenbah sald. 

The season went very well for 
the grapplers , with fine perform-
ances by most everyone. Season 
records included Wilson's 14 wins 
against 2 losses, Don Gamble with 
2 and 8, Jim Hamilton 2-3j Phil 
Costello 11-3, and Fred Grun-
wald 5-6. 

Again, Millenbah commended 
the freshman for an outstanding 
job. With Wilson, Gamble, Lie-
bermann, Nelson, Wonder, Myers 
and Grunwald al fros, some 80% 
of the squad are first year men. 

Next year should be even better 
for the squad. They will get back

its first swing through the col-

Twenty- one players have 'Shown

stowe plans to take 13 of these 
men apinst the 2nd team of Cal

12 games long, but will set the 
framework and provide exper-

aU the athletes playing are green, 
because most have had at least 
high school playing time. Two 
good pitchers have come out, and 
the outfield has talent and past 
experience. 

As is the case with most first 
year teams, the baseball quad 
Is composed mos tly offreshmen, 
with some transfers and upper 

division students. 'Coach stowe

Columbia, will present a free 
concert at the University of Cali-
fornia, San Diego, on Ma!'~~ l,:t~ 
4 p.m. in Muir College's Resi-
dence Quadrangle. 

The unlikely instrumentation 
of the band mcludes electric 
violin, electronic synthesizer, 
electric drums, electric harpsi-
chord, calliope and ring modula-
tor as well as the hardrock 
standards or guitar, organ, bass 
and piano. 

The band's six musicians, with 
their roots deeply Inavant-garde 
and classical music, use their 
arsenal of Instruments and super 
amplifiers to create an unprece-
dented mosaic of sounds inte-
grated into the Idiom of pop 
music, from soul to psychedelic: 

Dorothy Moskowitz, the lead 
singer, for Instance, comes to 
the band and rock music with a 
heavyweight background of clas-
sical, experimental, jazz, and 
Indian music performance and 
c'lmposition. 

Similar experience influences 
the United States of America's 
other members: Joseph Byrd on 
synthesizer and keyboards; Gor-
don Marron on electric violin; 
Ed Bogas on keyboards and gui-
tar; Rand Forbes on bass and 
Craig Woodson on electric drums 
which he designed and fabricated 
himself because no suitable in-
struments are commercially 
available. 

The group's synthesizer, an

ing musicality, was designed and

cuit deSign scientist for a com-

PHUD Plays What 
Students Want 

A group of ambitious students 
in suite 250 Galathea have taken 
it upon themselves to provide the 
resident students of Revelle Col-
lege with their first campus radio 
station. Broadcasting at830kcon 
the AM dial, PHUD bas beat the 
officially sanctioned UCSD sta-
tion, KSDT, to the punch. 

PHUD first came on the air 
December 1. Bill Rokaw, a PHUD 
deejay, said that the idea for the 
project began during the first 
quarter when music being played 
In the suite lounge annoyed those 
who wanted to study. 

Max Marshall, the "resident 
electronics genius", came up 
with the idea of transmitting the 
music within the suite. Eventually 
they extended their power to in-
clude the entire hall, and finally 
the resident complex as a whole. 

Much of the program material 
of PHUD is pre-recorded. Live 
broadcasting is always adllbbed, 
said Rokaw, who is the creator 
and designer of PHUD as well as 
the main deejay. PHUD is eager 
to accept request and dedications, 
which can be phoned in on the 
hot line, 453-3920. 

Recently PHUDpersonnel were 

advised to appear before the 
Communications Board of UCSD. 
They were told that they would 
have the status of a campus 
station If they stayed within the 
legal limits prescribed by the 
FCC. These limits are 100 mlIli-
watts of power and a 10ft. an-
tenna. 

PHUD broadcasted for about 
three weeks during December and 
after finals lapsed into a period 
of repair and rehabilitation. They 
returned to the air brieny re-
cently, but fully expect to return 
to the air within a week or two 
with their new expanded system. 

PHUD expects that Its new 
power and antenna will enable it 
to reach as far as the fringes 
of the Muir campus. They wUl 
be broadcasting, as before, be-
ginning at 8 p.m. each evening 
and continuing untlI some time 
around I o'clock in the morning. 

When asked what music PHUD 
plays, Rokaw replied "whatever 
the students want to hear, gener-
ally rock." He said that "PHUD 
will return," and reminded the 
students thatthe emblem of PHUD 
is the Chesire cat that Is seen 
in Galathea windows. 

~rirQ" <ilics 
Saltman Reveals 

Economics UC 
Recent arguments have been 

delivered concerning the tact that 
the University of California is 
receiving more funds than the 
state and junior colleges. 

A study by two San Diego 
state economists shows that Cali-
fornia is spending half as much 
for each student in state colleges 
as it does for students in the 
University of California. 

Another attack from USC by a 
Mr. Benson musters an argument 
on behalf of the private colleges 
and universities that not only is 
the University of California re-
ceiving more funds but that there 
Is much negllgence and waste 
within the state university con-
cerning these funds. 

In reply to these criticisms, 
Dr. Paul D. Saltman, Provost of 
Revelle College, stated that he 

.was "very perturbed and thatthe 
arguments, and the statistics 
contained in them, are ve ry mis-
leading." 

Explaining his premise, the 
Provost declared that "the origi-
nal roll! 1)[ the state college was 
to supply undergraduate educa-
tion on a local basis with tuition 
free. Consequently, its purpose 
was h IJf'Ii..,h a broadenil1g as-
pact of education with the Intent 
ot equipping the student in teacher 
education." However, its purpose 
was not "to be lnvoln'l I. In 
J,n'e aducatlon and post-gra-
duate programs." "Rather," 
stated Dr. SaUman, "the im-
portance of the state college 
lies In its ability to be a co-
operative educali ,)'lal '!nterprise 
involving the general education 
of a large amount of students 
at the least price." 

In contrast, the Provost de-
clared that "the University of 
California has an obligation to 
the state of California to accept 
the top 12 1/2 % of high school 
graduates in the stat! \ :11 Iur-
'llsh these students with the 
means to the best education pos-
sible." 

Moreover, he stated that' 'the 
University has the supreme task 
of furnishing the finest degree 
of graduate study and post-gra-
duate programs In research and 
development.' • 

"On the weighted student ba-
st.,," Or. Saltman pointed out, 
"It takes 3 l i z times as much 

expenditure for the education of 
a graduate student than an under-
graduate ." 

Furthermore, he stated that 
"it is a certain fact that the 
graduate and post-graduate pro-
grams of the University con-
cerned with such fields of higher 
education as physics, chemistry, 
biology and medicine nl J; ,', • .; 
! '/~)nally more funds than those 
programs of the state college 
concerned with teacher educa-
tion. In the state college, for 
instance, the facll1:, i:; 1): ~x· 
;Po J' ~ 1 ' ) '!ury out ttl'3 necesSJiry 
projects in scientific research 
and development. This is the role 
and duty of the University." 

In conclusion, Dr . SaItman 
commented that today "money 
per education is growing ex-
tremely tight. And, as to be ex-
pected, there are many sectors 
competing for the money. The 
University of California is not 
only one ot the largest and finest 
institutions in the nation, but it 
has the acclaim or the world. 
Definitely, its quality of education 
must be maintained."

Poet's L fe 
Recreated 

Writer and actor Emlyn Wll-
!Jams created the solo perfor-
mance trom Thomas' early works 
describing the poet's boyhood in 
a small Welsh fishing village. 
Dylan Thomas has become one of 
the twentieth century's most po-
pular and influential poets since 
his death in 1953 at the age of 39. 
Williams etches Thomas as a 
child, growing up along the Welsh 
seashore, through his early 
schooldays until, at age seven-
teen, he leaves Wales to storm 
London. 

Emlyn Williams appeared 3 
years ago before a capacity Old 
Globe Theatre audience as 
Charles Dickens. Born and raised 
in Wales, Williams first gained 
international attention for his 
drama "The Corn is Green," 
"Night Must Fall," Emlyn WJ-
113ms' other most famous play, 
Is considered a classic mystery 
melOdrama. 

Most recently Williams ap-
peared on the London stage star-
ring in his own adaption of Tur-
genev's .. A Month in the Country" 
with Ingrid Bergman and Michael 
Redgrave, and in Ibsen's "The 
Master Builder" with Michael 
RedgI.nll and Laurence Olivier. 
His most recent Broadway star-
ring roles include "A Man For 
All Seasons" and as the Pope in 
the controversial "The Deputy." 

Emlyn Williams appears at 
the Old Globe Theatre through 
the generosity of Mr. Ernest W, 
Mandeville and the cooperation of 
!·he Arts and Lectures Committee 
at the University of Caillornia at

tion for compatriots who had 
thoughts of lucubrating, will be 
palliated by the required MASK 
of deception, available tor free 
at the place at entrance. From 
the waking hour of 8:30 PM till 
late in the day one will be lured 
to the scene of the crime (more 
colloquially known as the South

The monumental film classic 
"Gone With the Wind" now in its 
fifth re-release s ince 1939, is in 
every respect as rich, moving, 
and forceful as it ever was. 

The old film stands up superbly 
I in a technical redesign that has 

\ 
expanded the prints to 70 mm. 
allowing for a wide-screen image 

\
and a six-channel sound track. 
These effects have incalculably

and of Max Steiner's musical

chell described it long ago, It Is

mance RS the aggressive .outcast, 
Rhett Butler, is quite powerful 
and timeless, and Vivien Leigh 

I as the fiery Scar lett 0' Hara Is positively brilUant by any stan-
i dard. 

In occasional shots it Is evi· 
dent that cropping at the top ot 
the frame has cut oCf a head or

some fading in the col'lr quality.

By today's standards, the clas-
sic may seem a bit too sentl-

Is supposed to have shocked audi-
ences in the 1940's when he walked 
out on Miss Leigh as Scarlett 
with his famous reply to her

An Equal Opportunity Employor 

British Films Rated 
The British probably produce 

the finest films anywhere in the 
world today. Sharp wit, brilliant 
moving dramatic performances, 
and sensitively beautitul low-
budget films have characterized 
the last five years of English 
cinema. A double feature com-
posed of a wildly satiric British 
comedy with Lynn Redgrave and 
Rita Tushingham ("Smashing 
Time" ) and a shocker called 
"The Penthouse" with some fine 
young Engilsh acting talent could 
not fall to be an overwhelming 
success. Or could It? 

Alas, even the British are 
taUlible. "Smashing Time" Is a 
daft film setting up Rita and 
Lynn as a comedy team tram the 
Midlands who invade swinging 
London hellbent for, Carnaby St. 
It becomes a fUm of wild social 
parody and old-fashioned slap-
stick which is far too ridiculous 
and has very little of the biting 
wit we have come to admire. Miss 
Redgra ve is the activist repeating 
her cow-in-a-china-shop bounce 
of "Georgy Girl", though now 
with earthy vulgarity. Miss Tush-
ingham plays the timid doubter 
and protector and can't help but 
be fetching with her large soulful 
eyes. 

But the charming pair simply 
cannot overcome a script which, 
though often amusing, is general-
ly inane and does not develop the 
fun and fervor you expect it to 
ha ve. There is a parody television 
show which will endear itself to 
anyone who has loathed Candid 
Came ra, and some sharp barbs 
at bizare fashion, tone-deaf pop 
stars, and the fake promotion of 
Miss Redgrave to a s inging ca-
reer . 

"The Penthouse" Is a rather 
sick, pointless exercise in shock 
and terror. It tells the story of 
a man and his mistress who are 
staying in the penthouse of an 
otherwise unoccupied new apart-
ment bullding. Two sinister young 
men, played superbly by Tony 
Beckley and Norman ROdway,en-
ter the apartment posing at first 

By Dave Sacherman 
as meter readers and soon ex-
posing that they are psychopaths 
interested in robbery and staging 
a party - not with the man of the 
house whom they tie to a chair 
but with the terrified girl played 
by lovely Suzy Kendall whom they 
relax by plying with Scotch and 
marijuana. The crowning touch 
occurs when the boys' pal Harry, 
a pretty brunette posing as their 
parole officer, arrives and 
proves to be as cracked as they 
are. At the finale, the original 
couple are lett degraded and 
disgusted with each other. Des-
pite a witty script, one never has 
a feeling of terror or sympathy 
for the characters, and whatever 
points about human fralUty were 
intended to have been made do 
not quite come across. 

Peace Delega te 
From San Diego 

Ernest H. Mason of San Diego 
has been selected as a delegate 
to the McCarthy Peace Slate. 

The McCarthy for President 
Campaign Committee of the 35th 
Ccngresslonal District met Sun-
day in San Clemente to nominate 
three delegates to serve on the 
Peace Slate delegation to be en-
tered in the Democratic Presi-
dential Primary in June. 

Mr. Mason was president of 
the La Jolla Democratic Club 
in 1966 and has be~n a field en-
gineering manager for mM for 
27 years. He has actively par-
ticipated in political precinct 
work and tund-ralsing events for 
the De mocratic Party. In addition 
to political activities he has been 
an adviser for Boys Clubs and 
worked with Urban League and 
the NAACP. He and his Wife, 
Joye, have three children. In his 
!;pare time he Is a ham radio 
enthusiast. 

Other 35th District nominees 
to the Peace Slate are Joseph 
Gerber of Del Mar and George 
Quinn of Laguna Beach. 

Director Luchno Visconti , a team of screen· 
writers and, most especially, Marcello Mas'troi-
anni as Meursault, have made from The Stranger 
an excellent film - thoughtful, moving and faith-
ful. Above all, faithful , for theirs is the kind of 
modest, self-effacing craftsmanship that serves 
rather than exploits its basic material. Eschew-
ing the temptation to overcinematize the story, 
with a lot offlashy tricks, they have concentrated, 
with commendable discipline, on allowing the 
grave voice of Albert 'Camus to speak to us in a 
medium that was .-not his own. It comes through 
firm and clear, and true. Since his was a voice 
that both summed up and shaped the sensibility 
of at least two postwar generations, it is well 
worth the close attention this film forces us 
to pay.

70 Profs Demand 
Public Apology 

More than 70 professors, em-
ployes and students at the Uni-
versity of California at San Die-
go yesterday signed a statement 
demanding a pubUc apology 
from two UCSD professors. 
The two professors were criti-

cized in the state ment for sen-
ding a telegram of congradula-
tlons Jan. 22 to Japanese stu-
dents who demonstrated against 
the arrival in Tokyo of the nu-
clear aircraft carrier Enter-
prise. 
The statement was addressed 

to the professors, Dr. Richard 
H. Popkin, chiirman of the phi-
losophy department, and Dr. 
Roy Harvey Pearce, chairman 
of the literature department. 
It appeared on a table near 

Sverdrup Hall on the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography 
campus February 15 and a 
Scripps spokesman said it will 
be carried to the Revelle cam-
pus for more signatures. 
It cited as "offensive" the 

fact that Popkin, Pearce and 
other members of the faculty 
and student body ident1l1ed 
themselves in the telegram with 
UCSD. 
"While you have the legal 

' right to make such statements, 
you do not have the right to 
imply In the Slightest that these 
sentiments are shared by others 
at this campus," the Scripps 
statement said. 
"Your ident1l1cation of your-

selves with the campus makes 
that impUcation and casts a slur 
upon your tellow employes and 
students. 
"We therefore request that 

you make a public apology for 
so doing and in the future If you 
have the urge to repeat this 
pertormance, identity your-
selves in some other manner." 

The Valentine's Dance spon-
sored by the Circle K Club and 
A.S. was sparsely populated. Lin- .. 
da and the Centaurs were reilly 
good but spent the first 45 mi-
nutes playing to an audience num-
bering no more than 15 people. 
It's too bad that the dance was 
held in the middle of a three-day 
weekend because many dormies 
were out of town and had to miss 
it. 

An ASP party and a party at 
Bob Nasset's also drew crowds 
on Feb. 10. Bob, do you always 
close the door on your guests? 

Last weekend was a weekend 
to leave the San Diego area. 
Sophomor e Al Hacker visited 
friends at UCLA while Jeff Fre-
linger took off to go sUing. 

All Physics 10 students en-
joyed the Valentine's Day test. 
The most touching part of the or-
deal was depositing finished tests 
in trash cans on the way out. 

The- sailing team journeyed to 
Santa Barbara and placed fourth 

c$ 
among eleven schools. Chris 
Pendleton stayed at the Alpha 
Phi house there. Ex-UCSDer 
Donna Miglore has pledged Alpha 
Phi. 

Opening night at Cinema 21 
with Dr. Doolittle proved to be 
less trying than expected. The 
Irish coffee and animal cookies 
served before the showing would 
have been better served at the 
intermission to help us through 
the imaginative second half. 

Speaking of Dr. Doolittle, 
Randy Doyle helped to tram some 
ot the animals in the movie while 
working at Jungle Land in Thou-
sand Oaks. Randy will be cele-
brating his 21st birthday the 22nd. 
Happy Birthday, Randolf! 

Congratulations of the week go 
out to Brian Lawson for drenching 
his RA with a trashbasket full of 
water. He later had to be pulled 
out from under his bed (scream-
ing "police brutality") by the 
cleansed RA for a mopping up 
detail.

Help Fill 
Library 

A "Bequest for !:looks" cam-
paign will be conducted througb-
out 1968 to assure development of 
the Central University Library 
at the University of California, 
San Diego into a great research 
library. 

b, Ro ge r Showle y 

AS Senate reaction to the Triton Times editorial of last issue was 
vehement to say tbe least. Action at tbe last two meetings, on the other 
band, seems to have begun to solve the problems the editorial raised. 

More than 100 members of tbe 
Friends of the UCSD Library met 
Sunday (January 28) for a kickoff 
luncheon at Revelle College. A. I. 
Dickman, pres ident of the 
Friends, which is supporting the 
project, introduced key persons 
in the campaign. They are: Chan-
cellor John S. Galbraith; Lt. Gen. 
Alpha L. Bowser, assistant to the 
chancellor for gifts and endow-
ments; MelvinJ. VOigt,librarian; 
and Mac A. Cason, chief campus 
architect. 

Rdaio KSDT's OJ's, Jon Collins and Bob Conrad, setting up for recent 
appearance at the Coffee Hut. The affair; dubbed Disco-Danc~ was highly 
successful. Watch for a repeat performance in the near future. 

On a report that $15,000 was unallocated for the remainder of tile 
year , the Senate proceeded to appropriate $10,700 at Its Tuesday 
meeting. $6000 was set aside for the Cluster I Student Center-inter-
national Center, which amounts to $1 per student per quarter this 
year. According to Tom Sbepard, chairman of the Center Committee, 
the allocation was made to begin a fund for financing the project, 
which is expected to be completed about 1972. $3000 was funded to the 
Social Activities Committee, headed by Gary Curtis, for more great 
entertainment In the third quarter. Curtis hopes to present a huge 
affair at the opening of the gymnasium, scheduled for completion 
about May 1. He also promises to provide some speakers, sponsored 
by the AS, to augment the lecturers planned by the Guest in Residence 
Committee. Finally, that appropriation of $700 to the Black students 
Council for bringing Dick Gregory on campus was reallocated, once, 
for bringing Stokey Carmichael, and then to the Guest in Residence 
Committee to bring a black nationalist on campus, "who Is agreeable 
to the Guest In Residence Committe and BSC." 

Dickman explained to the group 
that the purpose of the campaign 
is to encourage gifts to the Li-
brary in the form of endowments, 
bequests , book collections, sound 
recordings and rare documents. 

~t From Both 
Coasts Shown 

As a further hint of allocations to come, Dean Topolovac (Student 
Activities) said $3000 was planned for helping college governments, 
and $1500 for payiJIg for a senior gilt. 

The big event of last week's meeting was the replacement of Jim 
Miner's post as Lower Division Senator. Even though Muir College 
had nominated Bob Constanz to the position, Rich Aitenhoff sald only 
nominations could come through the executive (himself, in other words)( 
and subsequently, Peter Waasdorp, a Muir commuter (and Freshman) 
was seated. Bill Stiles, Muir's other representative, presented a petition 
this past Tuesday calling for nullification of the action. The petition, 
signed by the required 5% of the undergraduate student body and 
presented withln the 12-day limit as specified in the constitution, 
wUl be discussed next Tuesday. Stiles hopes for a referendum by 
Muir students to decide the matter, although all of R~velle could be 
Involved as well. 

"Tile growth of the Library has 
not kept pace, as far as the hu-
manities are concerned, with the 
growth of the University," said 
Dickman. "We need to add 
800,000 volumes to the humani-
ties and related fields collection 
and bring the scientific and tech-
nical collection to an effective 
250,000," he said. 

The Friends can solve this 
problem, Dickman said, by hel-
ping all San Diegans realize that 
this is their library and that 
they can enrich the library by 
bequests, by giving individual 
volumes, rare documents and 
other library materials. 

UC Starts 

Contemporary painting and ; 
sculpture of Los Angeles and 
New York will be shown in the 
University of Calilornla, San Di-
ego Art Gallery from Tuesday, 
February 13 to Sunday, March 
10. 

The one-month sllow features 
works by some of the best-known 
artists from the two major world 
art centers , according to Donald 
Lewallen, Director of the UCSD 
Art Gallery. 

"This is a good opportunity 
for students and the public to see 
contemporary works by artists 
from both sides orihe continent," 
Lewallen said. 

The Los Angeles artists are 
Billy Al Bengston, Craig Kauf-
man, Tony Sedant, Judy Gera-
witz, Lloyd Hamrol, Larry Bell 
and John McCracken. New York 
exhibitors are Martin Canln, 

, 

Frank Stella, Helen Franken-
thaler, Morris Louis, Howard 
Kanovitz and Philip Pear stein. 

The show includes a great 
variety of styles ranging from 
Pearlstein's very real nudes to 
Gerowitz' aluminum rectangles. 
Also included is a large house 
by BerIant, a plastic formed 
wall painting by Kaufman, a glass 
mirror box by Beli, large hard-
edge paintings by Canln, a series 
of color lithographs by Stella, 
large stained canvasses by Fran-
kenthaler and stripe paintings by 
Louis. 

Gallery hours on the opening 
day of the show will be from 4:00 
to 6:00 p.m. Normal hours for 
the remainder of the show will 
be from 11:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., 
Wednesday through Sunday. The 
Gallery is free and open to the 
public. 

Waasdorp, in any case, Immediately volunteered to head a com-
mittee to investigate the controversial eviction of Charlie Moore 
from the Revelle dormitories, The Senate, in reviewing Waasdorp's 
report this week, was faced with the definition of student rights 
on campus. Senator BUI Shark chaaged that the Senate had "jeopardized 
the welfare of the student body" by refusing to demand that the 
case aginst Moore be dropped. Rich Altenhoff, in generally admirable 
fashion, warned Shark that such a resolution would again reduce the 
AS to a "sand box government", whicb Shark has often claimed the 
Senate Indeed is. 

While I usually refrain from editorializing in this column, 1 must 
commend the AS Senate on such speedy reaction to our editorial of 
Feb. 9. Although I cannot be certain whether the critical (and criticized) 
article was responsible, I do think the AS has finally begun to deal with 
bas ic problems of UCSD. Congratulations! 

Unipress 
The University of Ca lifornia 

student newspapers have joined 
together In the formation ot a 
campus-wide press service, to 
be known as Unipress. Much like 
the national news services, As-
sociated Press (AP) and United 
Press International (U PI), it will 
provide same-day coverage of 
campus news. 

UC Presidents Unite Disco-Dance, March Z, Coffee Hut 

The service t>egan as an ex-
change between the UC LA DAIL Y 
BRUIN and the UCSB EL 
GAUC HO. Now it has been ex-
tended to include the other UC 
newspapers; the Berkely DAILY 
CA LIFORNIAN; the Davis CALI-
FORNIA AGGIE; the San Fran-
cisco Medical Center SYNAPSE; 
the Irvine ANTHILL; and the 
Riverside HIGHLANDER. Two 
campuses have two newspapers 
which will partic ipate: Santa 
Cruz, CITY ON A HILL PRESS, 
and THE MARINER; UCSD, TRI-
TON TIMES and THE INDI-
CATOR. 

Another feature of Unipress is 
the possiblllty of an edUorlal on 
a major issue whIch would simul-
taneously appear in all eleven 
newspapers , as 9 dramatic indI-
cation of student )Pinion. 

rlRED Of 

The UC student Body Presi-
dent's Council has charged that 
the the proposed UC fee increase 
is uncof..;titutional. 

The Presidents' Council has 
engaged Attorney WllIlam Ben-
nett to present their case in 
court. Bennett, a member of the 
California utilities CommissIon, 
volunteered his services. 

Undergraduate ASUCLA Pre-
sident, Joe Rubenstein, stated, 
"Our argument is based on the 
fact that any monies raised to 
replace an activity currently fi-
nanced by the state amounts to 
a tuition." 

The proposed fee increase sug-
gested by the Special Regents' 
Committee on Student Fees and 
Charges wlll bring the total fees 
to $400. San Francisco Medical 
Center President Denis Michaud 
said that this, " in essence, pro-
vides for funding of various Uni-
versity services by student fees 
rather than by the state." 

The committee's report said

that the fee increase will go for 
counseling service to offset part 
of the cost of the Dean of Student 
Affairs Office on each of the nine 
campuses. 

Michaud said that twenty-five 
per cent of the incidental fee 
which University students pay 
quarterly for student services 
is used for laboratory equipment. 
This is considered a service, 

even though it may be necessary 
for education. But, Michaud said, 
"No one has challenged this as a 
student service and this was the 
start. Now they're moving into 
student administrative offices 
which Is the point of contention." 

"Now," Rubenstein added, "in 
view of the fact that the Regents 
have delayed to increase fees, 
we have not asked the courts 
for an injunction."

Booth Debates Popkin 
Charles Booth, president of 

UCSD Young Republicans, and 
Jerry Popkin of the Sil partic-
ipated in a debate Wednesday 
night at the University Lutbern 
Church. 

Pastor John Huber opened the 
ceremonies by havlnr each olthe 
apprOXimately 25 people present 
Introduce themselves. Pastor 
Huber then gave a short summary 
01 goals of this program, which 
he said are to promote awar-
ness of otber's opinions and, 
hopefilly reconciliation between 
them. 

Charles Booth began the de-
bate with a general discussion 
of the principles he believed in 
(the contestants weren't assigned 
a subject, the format was very 
loose). 

Booth expressed his opposition 
to government aid both toforeign 
countries and In solving domestic 
problems. In fact, Booth charged, 
goverment can' t possibly succeed 
in solving these problems. in-
stead aid to foreign countries 
should take the form 01 private 
investments In those countries 
and we should rely on Industry 
to solve domestic problems. 

Booth endorsed the policy of 
"the least gove rnment possible." 
His suggestion for doing this was 
to raise the educational level of 
the people and eliminate govern-
ment in their lives. 

Jerry Popkin dllfered sharply 
with Booth on the subject of cap-
italism. He said that it enriches 
the few, while the many (95% 
was his figure) live in poverty. 
Popkin agrees that he would also 
like the government possible and 
the most freedom. 

However, he said, "freedom 
means very little to the person 
who is hungry."

that claims to be free. 

"We believe that compulsory 
mllitary service is unconsti-
tutional under the Thirteenth A-
mendment ( referring to the end 
of slavery after the Civil War), 
is loss of personaillherty without ; 
due process of law and is a ' 
means of procuring labor for gov-
ernment purposes at less than the 
market wage. 

"Our concern over the draft 
reflects our conce rn over a large . 
societal trend, a concern shared 
by leading spokesman of both the 
Richt and the Left. This trend is 
tbe tendency to subordinate the 
individual to society. 

"We affirm our bellef in the 
dignity of the individual and the 
importanca of IDd1vldualdecision 
we do not advocate any specific 
act, legal or lllepl, for any other 
than ourselves. 

"We affirm our bellef in the 
dignity of tbe individual and the 

Popkin also charged that the 
"United States is a repressor of 
movements for reform and this 
caused the alienation of students 
from its governemnt. They are 
opposed to the government that 
seems to be senselessly killing 
Vietnamese and carrying pro-
grams that are doing nothing for 
the poor or black people. 

Popkin then gave a short out-
line of what the Sil is. He said 
that it Is mainly a discussion 

group with the members holding 
many different opinions. They 
basically are opposed to tbe war 
and the racism In this country. 
However, beyond this point they 
don't bave a common goal. 

After Popkin's presentation 
Booth was asked to give the Re-
publican view of Vietnam. Booth 
said tbat there was also a vari-
ation of opinion among concer-
vatives, varying trom the isola-
tionists to thos e who are in favor 
of winning the war. Probably, 
the majority were in favor of 
winning the war.

In another-development the Up-
per Division Language Proficien-
cy exam was discarded as a col-
Ieee requirement. However, it 
was made quite clear that the 
Individual major and/or non-
contiguous minor departments 
may still require it at their 
option. 

The language committee had 
decided that the original idea of 
helping students to become bi-
lingual by requiring them to take 
junior and senior course work 
in a foreign language has been 
Inoperable. They stated, though, 
that passing of the exam is still 
a good idea for those who plan 
to go on to graduate work, bere . 
or elsewhere. 

The Committee decided that 
UCSD will continue to offer four 
languages, French, Germani 
Russian, and Spanish, but that a 
student may satisfy his lower 
division language proficiency re-
quirement by passing any exam 
In any modern foreign language. 
likely that the UC standard will 
soon be changed. 

The Provost's office of Revelle 
College stated that the mechan-
isms for registering cannot be 
set up before enrollment, but that 
students will be notified late r. 
students will not be able to use 
this option for every course' 
specifics will be disclosed at ~ 
later date.

This Program is designed to develop young college 
graduates for careers in life insurance sales and 
sales management. It provides an initial training 
pericx:l of 3 months (including 2 weeks at a Home 
Office School) before moving into full sales work. 

Those trainees who are interested in and who are 
found qualified for management responsibility are 
assured of ample opportunity to move on to such 
work in either our field offices or in the Home Office 
after an initial period in sales. 

Aggressive expansion plans provide unusual op-
portunities for those accepted.

Join a firm thallI 
give you executive 
responsibility your 
first day at work. 

Now, that's a pretly funny thing for a 
ivilian firm to s y. A boss? Right oul of 

co llege? The firsl day? 
Bul the Air Force can make such offer . 
As an offi r in the world 's largest 

technological orga ni zation you're a 
leader. Engineer. Scientist. Admi nislrator. 
Right wh re the Space Age break -
throughs ar happening. 

Or how about the execul iv respon-
sibility of at st pilot clocking 2,062 mph 
in a YF-12A jel? 

ThaI could be you, 100. 
But you don't have to be a pilot in the 

Air Force to move fa I. With your college 
degree you zip into Offic r Training 
School , spin out an officer, peed on 
your way as an cutiv , in th fore-
front of modern 5 ience and t chnology. 
Right on th ground. 

Th Air For mov pretty fast. 
Think it over. A man' car er can
