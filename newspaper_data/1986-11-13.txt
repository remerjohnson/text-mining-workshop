UNIVERSIN OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 1986 VOLUME 58, # 15 

By KRISTEN MCCLEARY, Staff Writer 

T HE mere separation of church and state puts religious activities at universities into an are.na which requires deli~ate balancing, but t~e economic and academic make-up of UCSD dictate an even finer hne to be 
trod upon. 

UCSD has neither an interfaith chapel, on or off campus, nor a depanment of 
theology or religiOUS studies in the academic curriculum. This cause~ a structural 
gap which has resulted in various suppon alternatives to sprout up In an effon to 
keep religion alive at UCSD. . 

Religion, like politics, can affect everyone - from the fervent atheist to the most 
dedicated Christian. At UCSD, the role which religion fulfulls is one that 
encompasses these extremes as well as other areas. 

According to Rabbi Miller, the director of Jewish campus centers in San Diego, "If 
it weren't for the specific location of UCSD, we'd have an interfaith facility nearby; 
and the lack of one has prevented religious leaders from doing what we try to do 
within a campus environment." Miller is also a staff member of the Office of 
Religious Affairs (ORA) at UCSD. 

The ORA is a cooperative effon among six religions to provide counseling, 
information and suppon for students. Bob Wagener, the coordinator of ORA, agrees: 

"There is a real need for a designated place to serve religiOUS needs." However, both 
men acknowledge that in La Jolla such a structure is economically as well as 
geographically unfeasible; therefore, "student organizations play an imponant role 
(in) religion on campus, more so than at most other campuses," Miller said . 

It is difficult to measure the religious involvement of UCSD students. The ORA 
"touches base with at least 50% of the students in some way, shape or form," said 
Wagener. He feels that UCSD falls in an "average pattern" as far as religious activity 
is cortcemed. "But religion is something that students pay attention to, as college is 
a time to change or question religious outlooks," Wagener added. 

Rabbi Miller, who works within the San Diego community, sees UCSD student 
involvement as reflective of a "commitment that is above average. The students I see 
come with a sense of long term commitment, both professionally and communally, 
which is where religion makes a difference ." 

Professor Kovel, who instructs a class on religion and politicS at UCSD, finds that 
his students are not panicularly religious or devout , "but they show a lot of curiosity. 
These students are eager to explore." Kovel spoke of one student who said that his 
class caused her lO question her religiOUS values and beliefs for the first time. "This 
is upsetting to her now, perhaps, but above all it's a valuable pan of her education."

Schoenberg receives 
disciplinary warning 

In a private letter dated 
November 7, Revelle Dean Ernest 
Mort informed Arnie Schoenberg 
that he was found guilty of 
violating the student conduct 
code last April when he poured 
red paint on an ROTC. 

The Revelle College JudIcial 
Committee came to the decision 
and recommended only a 
"disciplinal)' warning," because 
the damage done by the paint 
was not irreparable. Dean Mort 
concurred with theiC findings, 
and warned against further 
violations of the code. 

Schoenberg, who released the 
letter as soon as he received it, is 
still considering whether or not 
he will initiate an appeal. 
Aztec editor gets 
suspension delay 

The 24 hour suspension of R. 
Andrew Rathbone, the editor-in-
chief of the Daily Aztec, for 
Rathbone's defiance of editorial 
policy, was posrponed until 
Februal)' 2 by SDSU President 
Thomas B. Day. 

Day suspended Rathbone for 
publishing endorsements of 
political candidates in an 
editorial which appeared in the 
November 4 Daily Aztec. 
California State Universities are 
prohibited from endorsing 
political candidates and other 
ballot issues through unsigned 
editorials. This decision was 
made by Governor George 
Deukmejian's veto of Assembly 
Bill 1720. 

Rathbone requested a 
postponement Friday on the 
grunds that he needed more 
time to prepare a defense with 
legal counsel. He also asked Day 
to await the outcome of a suit 
filed by the editor of a Humboldt 
State newspaper regarding a 

similar violation. 
Rathbone has until December 

11 to appeal the suspension. 
Daniel Nowak, vice-president for 
student affairs, will make a 
recommendation on the appeal 
to Day by Janual)' 30. 
Mugging demonstration 
to be held 

A Model Mugging 
demonstration will be held at the 
Revelle Plaza today at noon. 
Jacque Hurtt, the Director of 
Model Mugging of San Diego, a 
UCSD student and graduate of 
the program and a male mugger 
will conduct the demonstration. 

Students will have the 
opportunity to learn techniques 
and to practice them with 
heavily padded male instructors. 
Model Mugging programs have 
been taught at Stanford , Harvard, 
and Radcliffe and are expanding 
throughout the United States. 

UCSB to hold

dialogue on nuclear issues will be 
transmitted by satellite and 
down-linked live on the UC 
Santa Barbara campus.

international groups of scientific 
and political leaders - one in 
Hamburg, Germany and the 
other in Washington, D.C. - is

non-scientists alike. 

The program is part of the 
International Peace Week of 
Scientists, sponsored nationally 
by the Union of Concerned 
Scientists. 

The first hour will consist of a 
discussion of the Strategic 
Defense Initiative or 'Star Wars." 
Panelists from Washington

negotiator of SIJ. T II, and Allan 

Mense, acting chief scientist for 
the SOl Office at the U.S. 
Department of Defense. 

The second hour will consist 
of an infonnal dialogue between 
European and American 
scientists on the role of the 
scientist and citizen in arms 
control.

Service is offering free measles 
and tubella immunizations to aU

contracting these diseases, 

A resurgence of outbreaks has 
occurred in the past year, 
sparldng many college campuses 
to launch campaigns to avoid 
measles epidemiCS.

Parkers petition 
meter increase 
By KRISTEN MCCLEARY 

RAY Brodrick couldn't find a quarter for the parking meter one morning. He left his car in a 20 minute parking zone while he went to look for change. After standing • 
in lines and walking to and from a store for change, Ray realized 
that his 20 minutes had expired. He returned to his car only to find 
a twelve dollar parking ticket on his windshield. 

Ray isn't the only UCSD student who's had cause to complain 
about the parking problems on campus this year. But he is one who 
is tl)'ing to get students to sign petitions in an attempt to change me 
meters back to last year's nickel, dime and quarter slots which were 
modified this fall to accept only quancrs. 

This decision to change the meters occurred ata meeting onJune 
24 of last summer. The Parking Advisory Committee (PAC) 
recommended this change in an effort to make the spaces more 
accessible to people by decreasing the time limit from 4 to 2 hours. 
There was n6 discussion in regards to the 100 percem cost increase 
of one hour from 25¢ to 50¢ nor of the meters being altered to 
accept only quarters at this meeting. The changes however did go 
into effect before fall . "These decisions were made without any 
investigation on student parking needs in an effort to make 
accounting more efficient," Dave Marchick, AS Commissioner said . 
"It's putting effiCiency over the public need." 

Brodrick feels that the PAC meeting ignored the student 
populace. "The meeting was held after school was out and students 
weren't notified of the ' meeting," he said. Kevin Simon, the AS 
parking representative, went to a PAC meeting in May which was 
supposed to be the last one of the year. The committee organized 
one for June, but Simon said that the only news he received about 
the meeting was a notice stating that he had missed it. "The

UCSD affimlative action 
sets "national trends" 

nalionaitrend for progams such 
as Early Outreach; especially in 
math and engineering: Benitez 
said . "With more funds, the 
California State Universities and 
Community Colleges may get 
such programs," he added . 

At present, Early Outreach 
offers academic advising; tutorial 
and I~aming skills services; 

coU~ge and career counseling; 
parent meetings and days; 
campus tours; Scholastic Aptitude 
Test (SAT) preparation 
workshops; and summer bridge 
programs to approximately 6,000 
underrepresented students in 
more than 60 junior high and 
high schools in the San Diego 
and Imperial Counties. 

the University system is 
detennined from the ethnicity's 
percentage in high school 
graduating classes. For example, 
Mexican-Americans comprise 20 
percent of California's high 
schools' graduating classes. 
However, only 4 percent of these 
Mexican-American high school 
graduates enter the Universil)' 
system: Benitez said.

Third's sewing of tongues 
The suspension of Third College Dean Beverly Varga has be ome the bane 

of local reporters: a story for which few sources have gone on record to clarify 
what really occurred. As for university policy, UCSD officials have been 
instructed not to publicly answer many of the questions PUt fOlWard by 
Guardian reporters; they have also virtually refused to talk to the local media. 

As part of this policy, the public minutes of a Third College Council meeting 
were recalled by Third Provost Faustina Solis because they contained 
"confidential"information. "We have an obligation to follow university policy 
which requires strict confidentiality, no matter what is being said by 
others,"said Vice Chancellor Joseph Watson, explaining the reason that he and 
other staff members would not commit themselves on the record. 

Guardian. But to use an analogy, while the UC Regents do not make 
underhanded deals to free hostages or command a large nuclear arsenal, their 
actions affect the lives of the staff and students of UCSD; this is much like 
how the actions of the Reagan administration affect the lives of the American 
people. The actions of UC should be monitored by a free press, under the laws 
of the Freedom of Information Act, and should not be given special exemption 
from public scrutiny. 

However, this policy ignores the damage that such "confidentiali\¥" inflicts 
upon the UCSD community. The only solid attributed information on the 
situation was told by Varga herself, when she described the charges as "so 
vague .. . it was a political manuever." But that's almost all that was heard from 
the official vein. Not one administration official has come fOlWard to openly 
discuss the charges against Varga, nor will there be such an occurrence unless 
the University changes its policy. 

The students involved in ·the case against Varga have not been informative 
wonders themselves. Their complicity in the admi nistrative silence seems to be 
wrought from a fear of reprisal by whatever group they believe they wiu have 
offended. Conversly, if these students believe that their actions in helping to 
suspend Varga were righteous ones, then they should come out and defend 
their stance publicly. If they do not, they will be guilty of shunning the 
panicipatiopn of the Third College student body. This would be a very 
pompous act indeed. 

In the meantime, the students involved have only provided anonymous 
information with little to say. Journalists are then worse off, because we are 
attempting to write a comprehensive, objective story based on the perceptions 
of only one faction . The student body is no better off. for they are left reading 
into a fog of vague comments. 

Anonymous informants are often not good sources of information; they are 
often afraid of exposing the truth . They also do not mind being affiliated with 
vague explantions - otherwise, they would allow the use of their names. True , 
the protection of sources is necessary, even for a UC paper such as the 

Our editors and writers who have worked on the story and wiu not quit 
until the student body is told the "truth." IZiI

Voters cheated 
Editor. 

This laS{ election. I was really 
confused . I now know to vote , 
but I dId not know where to 
vote. I found that I was not 
alone. M)' cwo roomrrtates. also , 
dId not know where 10 vote. One 
roommate dIscovered where to 
vote at 7 pm. however the poll 
had closed at 6 pm and not 8 
pm. Perhaps the epitome of this 
confusion was the knock I 
receIved on my apartment door 
at 7 pm A stranger had pulled 
off the SIde of the road In an 
anempt to grope through m) 

apartment complex to gel some 
information so she would know 
where to vote. She knocked on 
£wo doors, then knocked on 
mine. I answered the door, then 
tried to answer her queStion ; 
unfortunately. I was unable to do 
so because I myself was ilI-
informed . 

By now I began to wonder 
how many of us out there were 
never told where to vote , and 
conditionally how many of us 
were unable to do so. I deduced 
that our p roblem was that

received a confirmation, we 
never received a sample baUot 
including the location of our 
voting booth. 

I now called the San Diego 
County Registrar of Voters. I 
asked them what happened. 
They tOld us that yes there was a 
big mistake , but it had been 
corrected. Keith Boyer, acting 
regisrrar of voters, further 
commented to the Los Angeles 
Times Wednesday saying that 
there was a number of mix-ups 
in the ballots beginmng with 
incorrect sample ballots to voters 
not receiving their ballots. He 
saId that about 670.000 incorrect 
ballots were sent in October, but 
he couldn't even begin to 
esnmate how many of us could 
not vote because we didn't know 
wh ere LO go. He closed sa}'lng, 
"There have been problems 
simIlar 10 this. Whether this wiU 
be enough to have an effect, chat 
IS a question we don't know. We 
WIll look to see how close the 
vo te is." 

Well we now know that this 
mistake had a great effect 
CranstOn only leads by £wo 
thousand, and Kellea won by a 
few with respect 10 675.000. Sa 

how are we supposed to feel 
now, cheated? How can people 
say that we were apathetic to 
voting? As I see it, we did not 
even have a chance to be 
apathetic; we did not know 
where to vote . let's just hope 
that this mistake does not 
happen when we vote in '88 for 
the presidency of the United 
States

Award 
Continued from page 3 
UCSD's program is the largest 
and the most successful. Three 
years ago. the UCSO Early 
Outreach Program won the only 
award ever given for the best 
program in California . This year. 
the best publications award was 
given to UCSO's "Education: A 
Family Affair;" "Textbook 
Readi ng for Recall;" "Hints for 
Time Management;" and the 
Weekly Time Finder, aU of which 
are distributed to the high school 
students. 

The UCSO Early Outreach 
Program contributed the largest 
pool of UC eligible affirmative 
action students with 36 percent 
or 295 of aU 820 UC eligible 
students. UC Santa Barbara was 
the second largest contributer 
with only 14.63 percent or l20 
of all UC eligible targeted 
students. 

Last year, UCSO's Early 
Outreach Program hired 82 
UCSO students to go over 60 San 
Diego high schools to act as role 
models for low-income and/or 
underrepresented students 
through one on one counseling. 
conducting meetings with 
parents. and. tours of the UCSO 
campus. In . one to one 
counseling at the high schools, 
the counselor-aides talk about 
"preparation for college life in 
general ," the pamphlet says. 

"Through working as 
counselors for Early Outreach . 
UCSO students can get some 
meaningful experience for futu re 
employment other than 

dishwashing or some other 
menial work. They get 
experience dealing with 
administrators , etc. at these high 
schools ," Benitez added. 

"Some things we do 
consistendy, and they work. The 
other UC Early Outreach 
Programs constantly revamp and 
eliminate programs. We do not 
eliminate programs, but develop 
them and add new ones: 
Beni tez said . 

Benitez panly attributes 
UCSO's Early Outreach's high 
success rate to the vigorous 
involvement of close to 50 UCSD 
professors. UCSO doctors and 
physicists give presentations, 
show slides, and answer 
questions about thei r,teaching 
and research to 1,500 to 2,000 
minority high school students 
who come on campus tours 
during UCSO's Christmas and 
Spring breaks. 

Early Outreach also sponsors a 
Summer Residential Pro~ram for 
four weeks during July. The 
student spends one week on 
campus panicipating "in a 
program of experimental writing; 
campus-life orientation; 
educational and cultural 
presentations; and college 
counseling: the pamphlet says 
The students attend writing 
classes with an 8-1 
student/ faculty ratio , and the 
best written work of each student 
gets published in the Early 
Outreach Magazine . Although 
approximately 7 ,000 high school 
students in the mnth, tenth , and 
eleventh grades apply, only three 
hundred are accepted into the 
Summer Residential Program. Ii::]

committee representatives have 
no real input - the student 
voice gets lost under the 
demands of other factions. 
Nothing gets solved at those 
meetings," Simon said. Marchick 
added that no attempt at 
soliciting student opinion on the 
change was made through the 
AS. "This decision , like the 
alcohol policy, was made over 
the summer, when most of the 
students are gone." Marchick 
added. 

Both Marchick and Brodrick 
define the purpose of parking 
meters as serving the public: this 
includes students, Staff and 
visitors. But Vice Chancellor 
Steve Relyea says that the basic 
function of metered parking is to 
accomodate visitors. "The 
problem is that students weren't 
buying permits and they were 
taking away the . accessibility of 
the metered spaces from the 
visitors ." 

He also said that $15 ,000 was 
lost last year due to students 
using pesos or shaved pennies to 
tamper with the meters and 
"that's $15,000 that should've 
gone to building parking 
structures," Relyea said . The 
quaner only slots are more 
,difficult to tamper with . 

The parking system is self 
supponing. No state or 
institutional funds can be used 
to increase parking spaces. 
Relyea worked on a similar meter 
change at UC Irvine , which he

terms a successful project. 
"Berkeley and Oavis are the only 
UCs which don't have quaner-
only meters; and they'll mOSt 
likely be changing soon: he 
said . 

Brodrick, on the other hand , 
is confident that the petitiOns 
will be effective in returning the 
meters to the old method . "Our 
chances are excellent because 
what has been done is wrong. 
Now it's only a matter of time 
and red tape ." But Relyea says 
that the petitions, while making 
the administration re-evaluate 
the siruation . "won't be the sole 
determining factor. We must 
decide based on what is 
practical." 

ignored. "No investigation on the 
impacts of these actions were 
made by the PAC," Brodrick said. 
The administration , however, 
deems it as an economically 
sound way to open up parking 
spaces for visitors. 

"The greater good in UCSO is 
to build structures for the deficit 
of parking on campus," Relyea 
said. But parking additions take 
time - it will be 4 years before 
a new structure is completed on 
campus. 

The meter dilemma is not only 
a question of nickels and dimes. 
The student proponents of the 
petition see this as a case where 
their needs and opinions were 

Meanwhile the debate over the 
meters goes on . The AS in 
conjunction with the legal 
services on campus will continue 
circulating petitions throughout 
the campus. "If student opinion 
won't be heard through the 
formal channels , we'll be heard 
through other means. This is a 
fight for public need ," Marchick 
said. !l::I

Campus Religion 
Continued from page 1 

The imporrance of some sorr 
of academic instruction on 
religion In a public Institution is 
subject for debate. "As a general 
prinCiple, any university of great 
scope should have a program of 
study on religion in keeping with 
the very definition of 'university' 
which stems from the word 
'universal'," Kovel said . 

The ORA has structured itself 
to fill in some of the gaps 
existing in the whole of UCSD's 
religiOUS offerings. A variety of 
services which range from 
marriage counseling and 
ceremonies (Wagener said he 
has received over 10 calls thiS 
quaner from people who want to 
get married on campus), to 
providing chaplain services at 
the UCSD Medical Center. The 
ORA also sponsors lectures 
which focus on the academic 
side of religion in an effon to 
link all faiths on common 
ground. "We even cross-counsel 
people from different 
backgrounds," Wagener said. 
"Our traditions may vary but the 
religious leaders hold the same 
basic values in common ," 
Wagener stated. 

One inconsistency concerning 
this statement is that the ORA 
fails to include the eastern 
sectors of religion. Wagener 
defended thiS by saying that 
these factions "choose to 
organize themselves in such a 
way that is incompatible with the 
organization of our office." The 
Muslim religion , for example, has 
no ministry and It is imperative 
that one must be a properly 
credentialed religiOUS leader with 
a Master's degree or a PhD to be 
a member of the ORA. One must 
also provide financial support to 
the office, as it is self-financed. 

However, the Muslim religion, 
which is practiced independent 
of a church, has no collective 
funding. "I approached the office 
last year," said Nidal Guessoum, 
a spokesperson for the Muslim 
Student Organization (MSO), 
"and though the people were 
friendly, I achieved no help in 
supporr of the MSO." Last year, 

the Rationalists (formerly known 
as the Atheists and Agnostics) 
were included on the ORA flyer 
which reserves space for student 
religious organization advenising, 
but the MSO was not. Both were 
new groups. 

The MSO faces the most 
difficult problems on campus 
due to a misinformed student 
population on the actual religiOUS 
beliefs of Muslims. "We actually 
have people run away from us as 
we hand out flyers," Guessoum 
said. ' People are suspicious of 
our information." 

The Muslims show the most 
interest for interaction With other 
faiths'. "We are not here to 
conven. For the Koran says 
'There should be no compulsion 
in religion: " Guessoum quoted. 
He added that a large amount of 
Christians approach the MSO 
table on Revelle Plaza inquiring 
Into the relation of the two 
religiOns. 

"There are great similarities 1 
between Christianity, Islam, and 
Judaism," he said. The MSO 
sponsors such lectures as 
"Religion and Science" and is 
preparing to show a Critically 
acclaimed film starring Anthony 
Quinn entitled Mohammed, 
Messenger of God. They are also 
attempting to organize a dialogue 
between the Islamic, Christian 
and jewish faiths for winter 
quaner. "There is a need for this 
kind of interaction, because 
numerous people have exhibited 
great interest in such a forum," 
Guessoum said . 

The Rationalists are another 
splinter group from the broad 
category of religion. Last year, 
the group was extremely active. 
However, this year's President, 
Edwin Franks, thinks of his 
group as dormant, but "one 
which will be easy to resurrect." 

The Rationalists provide an 
alternative for students who have 
no religious inclinations or who 
feel that they must choose a 

reli~on just for the sake of 
having a religion. "One questions 
which religion to choose, but not 
If they should have one at all . 
We are here to show that many 

people ~re comfonable without 
any religion whatsoever, contrary "-
to popular belief," Franks said. 
The Rationalists are also against 
religious organizations who try to 
get political power in an effon to 
control various facets of 
education. 

In addition to the ORA, there 
is one other religiOUS structure 
which provides a variety of 
religious services to UCSD 
students. The Lutheran church , 
which is located close to the 
university on Torrey Pines Road 
across from Revelle , supports 
many interfaith activities (but 
again the term 'interfaith' is nOt 
all-conclusive.) On Sundays, 
Christians and Catholics as well 
as Lutherans hold church 
services there . On Friday 
evenings, the Chinese Bible 
Study meets at the church. 
Secular functions , such as 
recovery group meetings and UC 
Extension English classes, held 
there exemplify religion'S role as 
an integral pan of the 
community. 
The fragmentation of campus 
religion results in many small 
student organizations, which 
have sprung up independently. 
"There are roles wh.ic h are 
unique to both student and 
community groups," Rabbi Mille! 
said. "The latter provides a place 
to celebrate holidays and attend 
large worship functions under 
the direction of trained . 
individuals. (On the other hand) 
students can give to others a 
sense of individual suppon 
which can't be obtained in large 
groups." 

The jewish faith is a large 
religious faction on campus. 
"One in every seven students on 
campus is jewish," Paula Sulkis, 
the chairperson of the Union of 
jewish Students (UjS), said. The 
UjS provides a cultural, social 
and religiOUS service to UCSD 
students. "We offer a chance for 
jewish students to meet and 
interact with other jewish 
students as well as to educate 
them about their heritage," Sulkis 
said. She feels that many 
students are missing important 
knowledge of their own hiStory, 
"especially in the Reform jewish 
practice, there is a tendency to 
lose a strong identity with Lilt:: 
jewish people ."

Rewarding work 
By WENDY STERN, SIaff Writer 

H OW has UCSD been able to exist without it? People need it, and there 
is finally an AS organization that 
is willing to organize it. 

The Volunte'er Connection is 
the newest organization to 
become a pan of the AS, and ,its 
primary function is "to connect 
undergraduate students with 
volunteer projects in the San 
Diego area." 

The idea was first presented to 
the administration about a year 
ago by Robert Choate, a man 
who has helped to establish 
volunteer programs at colleges 
nationwide, includmg Harvard , 
Stanford, Berkeley, Yale and 
Brown . 

"San Diego is the eighth 
largest city in the United States. I 
think that there is a great need 
for this son of organizati0l'!," 
Choate explains. 

When Choate first presented 
this idea to the administration, 
his major emphasis was that the 
Volunteer Connection was to be 
100% student-run without any 
help whatsoever from the 
administration itself. This aspect 
of UCSO's volunteer organization 
is what sets ours apart from that 
of SDSU's and of USD's. 

Ellen Caprio, director of the 
Volunteer Connection said that 
student interest in volunteering 
has already been displayed. At 
the last Fall Festival on the 
Green, "25 students signed up 
for volunteer work," Caprio said. 

Right now, there are only twO 
others besides Ellen who make 
up the student staff of Volunteer 
Connection . Emma Caprio 
(Ellen's sister) and Wendy 
Sterman also volunteer time every 
week in an attempt to launch 
this new project. 

The Volunteer Connection acts 
as a Iiason which eliminates the 
paperwork and finds out, on a 
one-to-one basis, for what SOrt of 

organization a student would like 
to volunteer. 

The panicipants who work 
through the Volunteer 
Connection have to go through a 
training process which basicany 
teaches the fundamentals of 
volunteer work. Dr. Laurel 
Corona, director of UCSD's Oasis 
Tutorial program is presently 
being sought to help train the 
incoming volunteers. 

"I think that there is a lot o[ 
untapped energy out there ," Dr. 
Corona explains. 

According to C9rona, the main 
difference between Oasis 
volunteers and students involved 
with Volunteer Connection is 
that the Oasis usually takes 
upperclassmen with a minimum 
3.0 GPA "There are students 
with a lot to offer who JUSt can't 
meet our requirements who just 
want to help ," Corona continued . 

The main two areas of 
volunteer work are, for the most 
pan, social and health-oriented . . 
Social work includes working in 
high schools with potential drop-
outs, as well as counseling and 
tutoring. The medical work 
includes hospitals, convalescent 
homes and other medical 
institutions. 

Three out of the [ouneen 
UCSD greek organizations have 
already offered volunteer 
services. The Delta Gammas, 
together with Sigma Alpha 
Epsilon , volunteered to help with 
the fair that took place 
November 12th, escorting the 
visiting organizations to the fair 
site. A new fraternity at UCSD, 
Delta Tau Delta, requires its 
entire pledge class to volunteer 
as a prerequisite to entering into 
their brotherhood . 

When it comes to the 
combination of volunteer work 
blending with UCSD, there is 
nothing but good ideas, 
abundant energy and willing 
people . The need is there and so 
are the good-natured people . ~ 

To film or 
not to film 
By KRISTEN MCCLEARY . 

R EPO Man meets Shakespeare at UCSO. At least that's what things will look like at Central Library and the Stonehenge area for two days. This Thursday and 
Friday, Director Dr. Ron Shane will be filming an 
independent, no budget, version of Shakespeare's Comedy of 
Errors, a play dealing with mistaken identity and identical 
twins. Shane will be filming the play in a mix offuturistic and 
realistic style, "something akin to a 'Road Warrior:" Shane 
says. 

"This is an effort to demonstrate to producers and 
directors (the) need to take classic works of literature and 
produce them in film so that people can be exposed to our 
opulent cultural heritage in a manner that is germain to the 
films of today," Shane said. 

• The costumes and make-up will have a punk/animalistic 
flare and Shane expects the outdoorsening ofUCSD to create 
a feeling of the past. "I want the film to be primordial, exotic, 
strong and savage," Shane said. 

A post doctorate at UClA, Shane has worked under the 
direction of Peter Guber - the film producer of 
"Flashdance," ' Vision Quest," and "The Color Purple." Shane 
has also taught English at UCSB and Palomar College and has 
worked in Thailand and Indonesia filming primitive cultures. 
He is presently researcl)ing the Renaissance era working on a 
book; and he has also completed several screen plays. 

Shane will film the ostensibly farcical playas a metaphor 
rather than as a comedy which Comedy of Errors is usually 
thought of. "I want to show how the occult works in this play 
and how subtly and easily moved our perceptions can be," 
Shane said. In addition, the director is adding dancers to the 
film; a concept which he says is relatively new to the filming 
of Shakespeare. Shane hopes to broadcast this film on public 
or cable television. 

Shane will be filming near Stonehenge from 8:00 am to 
12:30 pm on Thursday and at the Che Cafe from 2:30 pm to 
4:00 pm that afternoon. On Friday, the Ce.ntral Ubrary will be , 
the setting from 7:30 to 10:00 am, then at the Bio Med library 
from 10:30 on. On Saturday, Shane will finish the filmingata 
house in Point Loma with scenes in a hot tub, a karate arena 
and on a balcony. Any UCSD students -whtf 'want some 
experience in front of the camera should show up in punk 
attire at t he filming sites. The film relies solely on the work of 
volunteers and Shane says that he still needs extras for scenes 
- none of which will be speaking pans. ~

The Christian faith has the

the Asian Amencan Christian

identity merely to create a 
comfortable atmosphere 
conducive to religiOUS study. "We 

try to make Christ the center of 
all our activities." said Michael 
Chin, a group leader. The MCF 
has 40 active members who meet 
twice a week - once In a large 
more formal meeting and once 
in small Bible study groups. They 
are organized under the japanese 
Evangelical Ministry, which is "a 
very vibrant minist!)' which 
provides suppon on college 
campuses around the country." 
The group sup pons itself by 
sponsoring a variety of activities, 
including winter ski trips, and 
food drives which aid Indo-
Chinese refugees. 

During the 1960s, the 

Christian faith had a newspaper 
on campus entitled The 
Flshwrapper. It did not last . Today 
L 'Chayim QuarterlY is the only 
student publication affiliated 
with a religion, although 
Assistant Editor Micah Barany is 
quick to note that is is not a 
religiOUS paper. "To be jewish is 
an eth nic and cultural identity as 
well as a religiOUS one," he said . 
The paper is much more political 
in design, in an effort to 
examine the jewish identity as a 
reflection of the diverse aspects 
of the Jewish character. "The 
paper is an important way to 
reach out to others, while linking 
the Jewish students to one

The separa te religious 
organizations rarely interact with 
one another. "ReligiOUS 
differences can be transcended 
or addressed in an adult way. 
We (the ORA) are a working 
symbol of that belief: Wagener 
said. But religion and politiCS 
can hardly be divorced from one 
another, which the war in the 
Middle East remains a constant 
reminder. "I don't see group 
friction between Muslims and 
Israelis, or between any other 
two religious groups for that 
mauer. 'But there are issues: 
Miller said . "There's a great 

amount of propaganda that's 
aimed at creating friction , and 
that 's unfortunate . It creates 
antagonism between groups on 
campus that need not be 
antagonistic," he added. 

Political eVents do cause 
periodic flare-ups between 
individuals of different religions, 
but both Wagener and Miller feel 
that this tension is not of the 
type which will cause long 
lasting conflict or surmount to a 
crisis. "We are proud that our 
religions are not at cross 
purposes in the academic 
environment. There is a sense of 
harmony, respect and strength in 
that," Wagener said . ~

OPINIONS 

!!tGO~OONrevolution in banking banks, more than their larger cousins, should take advantage of the opportunities in the cash 
management area and thereby 
improve their earnings potential. 
Evidence suggests that size alone 
is no longer an advantage; this 
has been demonstrated by ITI's 
clients who conSistently process 
and clear checks both more 
efficjently and profitably than 
their larger competitors. 

I N the past few years, the financial industry has undergone some deep and 
abiding changes. These changes 
have varied from a major 
marketer of retail products 
offering consumer financial 
services to the almost complete 
deregulation of banks. These and 
the changes yet to come have 
had, and will continue to have, a 
major effect on how banks are 
managed and, consequently, a 
di~ct effect on the whole 
economy and the American 
consumer. 

This revolution within the 
banking industry is ongoing. 
What was once the exclusive 
domain of commercial banks has 
spread to other types of financial 
institutions. A remarkable 
expansion in financial services 
offered by non-banks such as 
insurance companies; credit 
unions; thrifts; stock brokerage 
firms; and savings and loans are 
making themselves appear like 
commercial banks. They are aD 
offering services that previously 
only banks could provide: fuD-
service products, such as 
checking and savings accounts; 
ATM and credit cards; and a full 
range of lending services. Banks 
are no longer immune from these 
competitve pressures and now 
have to search for other sources 
of income. 

A recent survey conducted by 
the Bank Administration Institute 
and the accounting firm of 
Arthur Andersen and Co. found 
that by 1990, there Will be a 
reduction in the number of 
banks by about 33 percent. The 
largest decrease will occur in the 
number of smaD banks with 
assets of less than 100 million 
dollars. Medium size banks, with 
assets of between 100 million 
dollass and one billion dollars, 
will experience a reduction of 
circa 12 percent. However, the 
number. of large banks (assets 
over 1 billion dollars) wiU 
increase by some 26 percent. In 
1984, the FDIC reponed that, 

nationwide, there were 848 
banks classified as "problem 
banks." In a document issued by 
the FDIC for 1985, in California, 
seven commercial banks and 
several savings and loans have 
failed ; 34 commercial banks were 
classified as "problem banks." 

Besides the natural anrition 
(i.e., banks involved in mergers, 
etc.) that will occur, there is yet 
another force squeezing banks: 
legislation is pending in 
Congress for interstate (national) 
banking. There are, of course, 
some areas in the United States, 
such as New England, where 
regional banking is already in 
force. Already, regulators and 
consumer groups are lobbying for 
changes in the California laws 
to permit out-of-state banks to 
purchase California-based 
institutions. They fee! that this 
would cause increased 
competition and therefore be of 
some benefit to consumers. Some 
proponents of interstate banking 
also feel that larger American 
banks would allow them to 
compete more effectively on the 
world market with banks from 
Japan,Gennany, France, and 
England . 

Due to the Monetary Control 
Act of 1980, which aDowed more 
flexibility within the banking 
industry, there win be continuing 
and increasing competition over 
the next several years . This act, 
along with the external 
competiwrs such as out -of-state 
banks and non-commercial 
banks, will place new increased 
emphasiS 611 profits. Bank 
management needs to be aware 
of the alternatives and options 
available to financial institutions 
of aD size in order to cope with 
and take advantage of these 
changes. With this in mind, they 
need to take advantage of an 
opponunities to maximize 
profits. With the expectation of 
increased competition, the 
spread between interest rates on 
savings accounts and loans will 
dimininsh causing an ongoing

erosion in interest income to 
banks. Other opponunities to 
add to income must be explored. 
The main objective for all 
financial institutions must be to 
maximize profits. While the 
primary source of a bank's 
income is from interest on loans, 
there are other methods to add 
to earnings. Banks need to place 
the same effort into maximizing 
their internal operations as they 
put inw maximizing their return 
on investments. Security Pacific 
Bank, which was rated by a 
recent survey of banking 
executives as being the best-
managed bank in the West, has 
increased its earnings by 19 
percent. This was primarily due 
to income from other sources 
than interest from loans. On the 
other hand, some large 
commercial banks are having 
great difficulties with problem 
loans to third world countries 
and oil-related industries. This 
has caused dramatic losses to 
Bank of America and to Texas-
based banks. It also resulted in 
failures of major banks in 
Oklahoma and west Texas. 

One method of offsetting the 
reduction in income from loans 
is to have more of the efficient 
bank "back room" operations. A 
frequently overlooked area that 
can be maximized is the area of 
cash management. The necessary 
bank operations can be analyzed , 
and then increasing the number 
of employees. If the knowledge 
and expertise to accomplish this 
is not available "in-house," an 
outside consultant specializing in 
this area should be employed. 
Banks do not realize their 
porential for profit and a 
consulting firm like the L!. Jolla-
based ITI, can show banks 
methods of gaining from 
$200,000 to $1,500,000 a year in 
increased profits. 

More than 90 percent of the 
total number of transactions in 
the American economy is 
affected by checks. There is no 
doubt of the myriad ways that

checks can be handled and 
routed for collection; 
unfonunately most banks are not 
aware of them. The profit from 
maximizing the check coUection 
process is often reflected by a 
substantial increase in the net 
earnings of the typical bank. 
Additionally. there is porentiaDy 
a significant benefit to 
consumers because banks will, 
on the whole, pass on any 
increased efficiencies by 
reducing the number of days that 
a bank places a "hold" on a 
check. This could be of 
enormous benefit to customers 
who deposit a fairly large 
number of checks. 

Medium-size banks and 
community banks operate in a 
challenging environment. These 

The future holds much 
promise for weD-managed banks 
that will be able to adapt to 
conditions and will be aware of 
opponunities. Independent 
banks can and will survive only 
if they are able to adapt and 
remain profitable. They need to 
concentrate, as has been 
demonstrated by the experience 
of Security Pacific Bank, on 
maximizing potential profits in 
such areas as cash 
management. ~

program. It would have been 
foolish for the President wallow 
himself to be suckered into a 
hasty agreement that would put 
at risk a system that could 
protect the U.S. from Soviet 
ICBMs in exchange for an INF 
agreement that still worked out 
to the Soviets' advantage. 

Far from being a case of 
"Reagan's meddling in 
Reykjavik," the hasty summit was 
a Soviet ploy engineered as pan 
of the distasteful deal to liberate 
Nick Daniloff. By offering a few 
weak concessions and with the 
pressure of up-coming elections, 
the Soviets hoped to give 
President Reagan a bum's rush 
into an ill-advised agreement. 

Rather than being an 
opportunity for political capital, 
as Quercia suggests , Reykjavik 
was a minefield - especially at 
election time. The Soviets clearly 
planned on forcing the President 
to dump SOl or embarrass him 
by sending him home empty 

handed after their hints of 
enticement at Geneva. With so 
much to lose, going to Iceland 
was actuaDy a poor move 
politically. However, because of 
his sincere desire to find an end 
to the nuclear' balance of terror, 
the President igno~d the 
warnings of conservative leaders 
and met Gorbachev with high 
hopes and good intentions. 
Fortunately, most Americans 
correctly fault Gorbachev with 
the failure to reach an agreement 
and applaud our President's firm 
stance. 

A strategic defense is the only 
plausible way to put an end to 
the nuclear threat to the world. If 
the Soviets truly desire 
disarmament (and they probably 
don't, because without its 
military might, the USSR would 
be a third world naoon), SOl 
need not hinder arms reduction 
and in fact could assist the 
process. In his refusal to 
abandon SOl, President Reagan 
made the correct decision.

Wingate injury 
may hurt team 
By GUS SANTOYO and CHARLES TABESH 

FOR John Wingate, it will be a penalty he will not soon forget Cruising down Regents Road on his scooter, a red VW bug, pulling out of the driveway, collided with 
Wingate, sending him flying through the car's passenger side 
window. Sent to the hospital for treatment, Wingate received 
fifty-five stitches on his face , in addition to suffering a 

. dislocated wrist and severely bruised knees. 
Luck on the UCSD men's soccer team has come in shon 

supply and the loss of their star forward for Sunday's Western 
Regional final against St John's (of Minnesota) could 
dramatically affect their ,hances to advance to the Final Four of 
the divisio~ III championships. 

But as frustrating as it is not [0 play, Wingate thinks that just 
being alive is cause enough [0 be happy. "When I get 
depressed and think about not playing Sunday, 1 just think of 
how happy I am to have come out alive ," said Wingate. "The 
way I look at it, I could have been out the rest of my life 
instead of just one game." 

Wingate's size will be missed up front against St. John's, who, 
according to assistant coach Brian McManus, have a hockey 
mentality. "We really haven't scouted them that much but we do 
know they're very big and physical." said McManus. ·Without 
Bubba, will have to rely on guys like Carrick Brewster and Joe 
Giacalone [0 pick up the slack." 

Claremont coach Steve Davis, whose team lost to UCSD in 
the first round, feels the Tritons should win the game. "I quite 
frankly think that UCSD should win the game," said DaVIS. "We 
played them to a scoreless tie , and based on the games we've 
had against UC San Diego, I'd say UCSD is a much better 
team." Please tum to page IS 

It's showtime for Tritons 
UCSD, Menlo favored to reach regional final 
By GUS SANTOYO, Sports Editor 

FOR Doug Dannevik, it was a long time in coming, but the crowd finally 
showed up for a game against 
Menlo. The impression was great. 

"It was probably the greatest 
crowd I've seen in my eight years 
of coaching here," said Dannevik 
of the 6OO-plus crowd match that 
attended last Saturday's final of 
the Seagram's Cooler Classic. 
Their next meeting, if it comes 
off as planned, could quite 
possibly be the largest crowd to 
an athletic event in the history of 
the school. 

Why? If they do meet again, it 
will be in the championship 
game of the NCAA DiVision m 
championships. Dannevik feels 
the crowd could be the dividing 
factor, as it was Saturday night. 
"Last Saturday night'S game was 
the first time I saw the crowd 
have a real impact on the game," 
said Dannevik. Based on what I 
saw, I think the excitement of 
the match and the imponance of 
the championship, we should 
have our biggest crowd ever. 

The team itself is, according to 
Dannevik, "very loose and 
relaxed." And this loose, relaxed 
attitude has other team's scared. 

"UCSD's a very experienced 
team," said San Bernardino head 
coach Naomi Ruderman. "Having 
been in the pla)Olfs several 
times, having the home crowd 
and home coun advantage, it'D 
be extremely tough to beat 
them." 

Dannevik is also of this 
impression. "If we're off, the 
teams in the regionals have the 
talent to win. But if the crowd's 
into it, they'll have to playa 
careei' match to beat us." 
Methodist College (North 
Carolina) 

The Monarchs are just happy 
they have the chance to Oy out 
to the west coast. Coach Dan 
Laurence's team was the last 
team selected after winning the 
Dixie Conference, although they 
did place third in their league. 

Colorado Col. 

The eighth-ranked team in the 
nation has a very San Diego 

flavor to it. Five of the players on 
the team attended St. Francis 
Parker High School in Mission 
Hills and winning the 
championship would be a sweet 
homecoming. 

Setter Amy Smith and middle 
blocker Cathy CosteDo, both All-
American candidates, are the 
hean of Colorado complex 
offense. "Since we're not very big, 
we run a vety quick and very 
sophisticated offense," said head 
coach Susan Bethanis. "We are 
weak on our outside aaack, but 
we're strong up the middle," said 
Carol Bethanis. 
Cal Scale San kmardiDo 

"We're not intricate, we're nO( 

flashy, and we playa very basic 
game," commented head coach 
Naomi Ruderman on the team's 
style. Although CSUSB gave 
UCSD troubles earlier in the 
season, Dannevik foresees no 
problem in handling CSUSB's 
slower paced offense. 

UnMnUy of La Verne 
La Verne, ranked twelfth in 

the nation and last years runner 
up for the national 
championship, may not be as 
strong as last year, but according 
to Dannevik,they are 
tremendously improved from 
early in the year. "La Verne is 
almost not the same team from 
early in the year," said Dannevik 
"They play an attacking style, but 
they don't have enough players 
to win it." 
MenioCoU. 

After watching last Saturday's 
showdown, its easy to 
understand why everyone is 
drooling for a rematch berweeri 
Menlo and UCSD. All three 
matches berween the two have 
been hean stoppers. 

Coach Malcolm Taylor's squad, 
though, is not looking ahead at 
an. "Right now, we're jUst worried 
about Colorado College. UCSD's 
a great team, but we have other 
things to think abouL" 

Dannevik feels that Menlo has 
a tendency to play above their 
heads against UCSD. Their a 
great team, but when they play 
us, they playa notch higher. ~

Football at UCSD has its time come? 
By RANDY GAROA and JOHN FLORES 

I SN'T it about time that UCSD gets out of the dark ages? Don't you think that it is 
about lime that UCSD joins all 
other major colleges around the 
nation in school spirit? Aren't 
the students in our society 
changing and requiring different 
social needs and other 
educational outlets? All of you 
out there hear from your friends 
at other colleges, see on T.v., or 
read in newspapers about 
students and alumni going crazy 
in suppon of their school and 
athletic program, but what about 
UCSD? There seems [0 be no 
such thing as school spirit 
existing on this campus as a 
whole. You see it only in sman 
groups and sections, be it 

sororities, fraternities , and social 
clubs, but not as a whole unified 
campus. We, as students, only 
identify ourselves with our own 
panicular campus. That being 
one of the four here: Muir, 
Revelle , Third, and Warren. But 
what one thing in our society 
can bring us together at the 
begining of every new school 
year? It is one of America's 
favorite past times, FootbaU. 

What O(her spon can cram 
70,000 people into a stadium on 
a Saturday afternoon or evening; 
students, alumni and faculty , 
supporting their team and their 
college. This seems to bring 
alumni back after graduation in 
suppon of their school. How 
many of you would come back to 

UCSD after graduation to 
suppon this institution? UCSD 
gave you a great education but 
nothing really exists to tie school 
and social events together. Most 
people put in a great time and 
effon in education but never 
reaDy have the pride to come 
back and visit. That is why we, 
as a student body, must take a 
stand and try to change what our 
school has been lacking in the 
past: the need for a footbaD 
team. 

The suppon is out there, 
considering we have one of the 
largest Intramural Programs in 
the nation. Our values have 
chan.&ed at UCSD since our last

UCSD ·makes run for western regionals 
By JONATHAN SCHRETER 

O N Saturday, November 15, UCSD will play host to eighteen universities 
and coijeges from California and 
Oregon for the 1986 NCAA 
Division III Western Regional 
Cross Country Championships. 

Two hiUy courses (five 
thousand meters for the women, 
eight thousand for the men), 
utilizing both asphalt and natural 
terrains, have been plotted 
entirely on campus, beginning 
on the Warren Field on the east 
side of the campus across from 
the Canyonview pool. The 
women's course takes them to 
the par course near John Jay 
Hopkins Drive, around the Super 
Computer and back to the field . 
The men run a similar course, 
with a second Jap around the 
Super Computer, a loop on Mile 
High Field, and a stretch around 
the Central Library to increase 
their course's length. 

The top men's and women's 
teams and tOP twO individual 
runners in each race will qualify 
for Division III Nationals, which 
are scheduled for November 22 

at Fredonia State University 
College in Fredonia, New Yo~k . 
UCSD Coach Andy Skief is 
expecting a top four finish for 
his Triton teams. ·Sabrina Jensen 
and Jisele English should qualify 
for nationals in individual spots," 
said Skier. 

Coach Bill Harvey of 
Occidental College, UCSD's 
biggest rival and the defending 
champions of both the team 
titles and the 10th place at 
Nationals, doesn't agree. 
"Michelle Trimble and Linda 
Van Housen, our two leaders, are 
perhaps the beSt (WO runners in 
the country and should qualify. 
However, the rest of the team 
will have to finish close to them 
if we are to go to the Nationals 
as a team," Harvey said. Trimble 
has been ranked All-American in 
Cross Country and has placed

many to be the favorite of the 
meet. 

As for the men , nobody is very 
sure of what to expect. Said 
Harvey, "We won't know who 
the favorite is in the men's race 
until it is underway." Freshman 
Merrel Hora will be leading the 
Triton team. As a newcomer, 

Hora might prove to be a big 
surprise to the other teams. 
Others who could be strong 
contenders as team victors are 
Redlands; Cal State Stanislaus; 
and Occidental, who wiD be 
sending a group of five 
sophomores. "They run very 
similar times and should be in 

close contention : Harvey said . 
Coach Skief plotted the course 

with the spectator in mind, and 
he hopes for a decent turnout 
along the course. The men's race 
is scheduled to stan at 11:00 am, 
and the women's will begin at 
12:00 noon .

Football 
Continued from page 11 
1968. However, in '68, they only 
gave the football program a one 
year try and then discontinued 
it, in fear that giving out athletic 
scholarships and recruitment of 
players would lower academic 
standards. But we have changed; 
we're now seeking education 
before athletics. It is time to give 
a football program another 
chance. It is just like the planting 
of a tree: do you, after just one 
year, pull it out without giving it 
a chance to take root, grow, and 
flourish? 

First of all the athletic program 
itself is lacking support by the 

S(~dent body. We have some of 
the top Division III teams in the 
country, but nobody seems to 
care. There isn't anything that 
brings us together as a unit here 
at UCSD; however, a football 
team always seems to accomplish 
this at other colleges at the 
beginning of evety new school 
year. The football programs at 
other major universities seem to 
involve the students and make 
them more aware of the other 
athletic programs on campus. 
There is no other social event 
bigger than a football game. 
There is no other place that 
could draw so many people 
together at one time. 

Secondly, the social events, on 
the campus at the present 
moment, are lagging 
considerably. For a university 
that is expanding so rapidly, 
there is not one social event that 
brings us aU together. There are 
only small individualistic 
functions. A football team might 
bring aU of us together and help 
us meet everyone else. This 
would inspire other school 
oriented activities for the whole 
campus. A team will help 
students become more involved 
with school instead of just 
passing faces in the library. 

Ar the present time, this 
campus has no emotional outlets. 
But the attendance of a football 
game would let students get rid 

The great !leers of the world go by one name: Liiwenbriiu. Brewed in Munich, 
in England, Sweden, Canada, Japan and here in America for a distinctive world c1a~s laste.

of unwanted emotions and 
stresses, by enthusiastically 
roaring their team on. As we aU 
know, football is a physical game 
and this would let people who 
do not want to experience the 
physical contact become 
involved with it. These social 
gatherings would enable people 
to communicate and socialize. By 
doing so, they will become better 
prepared for the outside world. 

Stop and think. Someone has 
to have the backbone to start 
and initiate a football program 
here at UCSD. We can't be those 
people who say, 'Someone else 
will start it: We as a student 
body must take that first step. 
College is for us and what we 
can make of it. Isn't it about time 

for UCSD to try a football 
program once again? The football 
program will initiaDy be funded 
by us and for us; therefore, you 
can see your money in action -
nar in a desolate comer of a 
building that you, as an 
undergraduate student, will never 
see or use. If we want a program 
and are willing to fund it, the 
university wiD have to listen to 
us, the students. Life is made of 
chances and gambles, college is 
one of them. It took Burt 
Kobyashi and a few feUow 
students to get Canyonview Pool 
off the ground. Remember the 
time is now, and we must stand 
md fight for what we believe 
in.

Wingate's absence , though , 
change~ the odds. But , with this 
being UCSD's last home game of 
the year, Wingate hopes the 
crowd and his injury will help 
rally the team. "If we can get a 
huge crowd out there and our 
team can dig in and play hard , 
we'll win ," said Wingate . 

-The Johnnies (you read right) 
have a perfect 14-0 record and 
are ranked sixth in the nation. 
UCSD, on the other hand, is IS-
S and ranked number twelve. 
Might St. John's be a little 
overconfident going into 
Sunday's playoff game with the 
Tritons? Not exactly. "I think that 
you're going to take a look at us 
and snicker, 'What are you guys 
doing with an undefeated 
record?"' said Pat Haws, coach of 
the St. John's soccer team. 

Is he serious? Or is this just 
strategy designed to lull the 
opponent to sleep, then pound 
them into oblivian? Well, Haws 
docs have many real concerns, 
the main one being the travel.

Friday and he fears the change 
in environment may affect his 
team's performance. Another 
problem already incurred by the 
team is the weather in 
Minnesota. It climbed to zero 
yesterday. ' We are very definitely 
handicapped for practices, I 
heard it's 80 out there: Haws 
said with envy. 

Also, the Johnnies rank of 
sixth in the country may nor be 
deserved . Their schedule was 
relatively easy. Admitted Haws, 
"It was sure not as tough as you 
guys played. You guys played , 
what I think, is a real tough 
Division 1lI schedule . .. I think we 
were rated on our perfect 
record ." So the game is probably 
more evenly matc hed than the 
stanstics would indicate. 

To get to Western Regional 
Final, St. John 's had to beat the 
University of Wisconsin, 
Whitewater last week. The 
strength of their play lies in the 
midfield contribmion of Bob 
Manning and John Burke. But 
the Coach believes intangibles 
do more to explain the team's 
success. "We have a very, very 
close team. They are their own 
best friends: he explained . ~ 

Waterpolo

By DARREN K]ELDSEN 

H ARD times as well as a hard schedule have faDen upon the UCSD water 
polo team. After a good first half 
of the season , the Tritons have 
now dropped six matches in a 
row. All the losses have been at 
the hands of some pretty worthy 
opponents, every one of the 
teams are from California and 
every one being ranked in the 
top ten in the nation . 

The water polo team is now 
12- 18, and ranked 12th 
nationally and the NCAA open 
tournament seems to be OUt of 
their post-season plans. 
However, Coach Harper and his 
team are looking forward to the 
National 1nvitiational 
Tournament at the end of the 
year, where they should be the 
number one seed. ~

Loving Tribute 
by lara mihata and jeffrey kleen 

As a. memorial tribute, the 
La Jolla Museum of 
Contemporary Art will 
present selected works of 
Phi lip-Dimitri Galas, the 
playwright who tragically died 
last August at age 32, on 
Saturday, November 15 at 
7:30 pm. A native of San 
Diego and a UCSD graduate, 
Gala earned great respect as a 
writer and creator of unique 
'thea tre works. Stuart 
McLean , the museum's 

Philip Dimitri Gaku 

performance curator, speaks 
highly of Galas: " He was a 
true origina 1, one of 
America's most gifted young 
playwrights." Gala's work has 
been critically praised and 
honored, receiving both the 
Hollywood Drama-Logue 
award and the L.A. Weekly 
theatre award for concept and 
direction. 

The November 15 perfor-
mance will feature excerpts 
from three of Gala's works: 
" Performance Hell," "Mona 
Rogers in Person," and "Baby 
Redboots Revenge. II They 
will star Sando Counts, a 
noted vaudeville and circus 
performer; Helen Shumaker, 
a native of San Diego and 
acquaintance of Galas since 
1981; and Sean Sullivan, who 
has performed in many 
productions at San Diego's 
Old Globe Theatre . The 
performance will be in the 
Sherwood Auditorium (part 
of the La JoUa Museum of 
Contemporary Art), located 
at 700 Prospect Street. 
Tickets are $5, available 
through Ticketmaster outlets, 
the UCSD Student Center, or 
the SDSU Aztec Center. All 
proceeds of this tribute wiU 
benefit the Philip Dimitri-
Galas Memorial Fund at the 
museum. For additional 
information, call 454-0267.

Yes, it is possible to go back to the fifties once more. 
Enter the Paladins, a popular San Diego band wh08e 
rockabilly tunes have opened for ,such greats as Stevie Ray 
Vaughn, the Blasters and X. 
. Grouped together since 1982, the Paladins have 
displayed what the Los Angeles Times considers "gut 
wrenching rock-n-roll" throughout eight states during 
five concert tours. 

Paired witb the Wild Cards, though, the Paladins may 
have met their match. Often called "unique" and "slick", 
the Wild Cards also have an impressive background. 
Bringing back the sounds from the zoot suit era, the band 
has declared that the only reason they're around is 
because they love what they are doing. 

Regardless of their reasons, both bands have received 
generous reviews. You can be your own judge when you 
see both bands on November 15 attheTriton Pub. Doors 
open at 8 pm and tickets are $4 for students, $5 for non-
students.

"Partita" for solo flute by 

Flutist Ann laBerge 

by ni .. 1 Ilndemann 
J .S. Bach, during an evening 
of contemporary flute 
music. The November 15 
concert is free in Mandeville

of the program will be 
"lighter, using the flute in a 
more conventional fashion," 
and the second part will 
"incorporate a more unusual 
technique" featuring 
computer-generated and 
altered-tuning works. 

LaBerge, who comes from 
a musical family, has evolved 
into primarily a new music 
performer, although s~,e 
admits to playing a 
conventional piece now and 
then . In addition to 
appearing in concert, she has 
taught classes focusing on 
the" Alexander Technique," 
a method of improving a

LaBerge, cu rren tl y 
pursuing a theoretical

that it is "a research degree in 
music; performers can 
undertake areas of their 
specialty." She said that this 
contrasts with the standard

degree, "which isn't so

LaBerge may use her 
degree to obtain a position in

"Although I would love to

institution someday, I am 
skeptical about many .of the

aUCSD 

play 
by daniel thomas 

The staging of the 1931 
Pulitzer prize-winning 
musical, Of Thee 1 Sing, is a 
result of director Michael 
Kantor's exposure to the 
machinations of government, 
witnessed while working in 
Washington, D.C., last 
summer. 

"The way that the Reagan 
administration was running 
the country, it shocked me 
daily . I could not come to 
grips with the way certain 
things were being handled, the 
way the . media was being 
purposefully misled." 

Kantor is joined in the 
production by UCSD 
professor of music Thomas 
Nee, who is conducting the

Si nce we got so many responses (the big zero) to the first 
music trivia quiz of the quarter, we aren't going to print 
the answers to it, as punishment. Yes, the questions were 
hard, but we didn't ask you to answer all of 'em, just as 
many as you could . ... Imagine, you could have walked 
away with an lRS album (or two, or even all three, since 
there weren't any entrants) last week, if you happened to 
have turned in an answer or a partial answer to just one of 
the questions. Well, this week's questions are as hard to 
answer as last week's .. . . But, we have faith in you to give 
it a try, what could it hurt? The same three albums are up 
for grabs, and you could just walk off with a free album or 
two. It's as easy as scrawling down, "Two of the three 
bands formed by ex-English Beat members are 'Fine 
Young Cannibals' and 'General Public' ." Good luck! 

Questions 
1. Who was the original lead singer of Genesis? 
2. Who is Carly Simon's hit single "You're So Vain" 
written about? 
3. What is Sting's real name? 
4 . In Don McClain's highly metaphorical song "American 
Pie", who does "the father, son, and holy ghost" refer to? 
5. Which album has sold the m08t copies internationally?

Kantor 's staging is meticu-

such a large production was 
unlike working on a small 
play. Music rehearsals, acting 
scenes, and dance work are 
mostly all conducted by

make sure that it all works 
together.

gimmicks. He does not 
exaggerate reality, but rather 
he pinpoints the absurdities of 
everyday life. When he is on 
stage, Seinfeld tries to create 
an honest rapport with his 
audience. He says, "I ama real 
person. I'm not trying to 
invent any image on stage. The 
ultimate comic act is just 
being yourself. " 

Seinfeld is enjoying his 
newly,achieved popularity 
and attributes it to the 
honesty in his act. Seinfeld 
enjoys when fans from 
different cities come up and 
talk to him. He says that his

Recentl~, the number of his 
fans has been on the rise. 

In 1980, he moved to Los 
Angeles to pursue a career in 
comedy. At a local night club, 
he was sighted by some talent 
scouts for Johnny Carson. 
Soon after, he made his first 
appearance on "The Tonight 
Show." He followed this with 
spots on "The Merv Griffin 
Show" and "Late Night" with 
David Letterman. While 
continuing with his stand,up 
routine, he landed a job as a

semi,regular on the cast of 
"Benson" during its first 
season. More recently, 
Seinfeld was praised for his 
work on Rodney Danger-

rent to pay. They can't afford 
to be put out of work for 30 
days, II said Durta of Confetti. 

Most clubs seemed to 
sympathize with the college 
kids who are at the awkward 
age where they're considered 
adults by the law, yet they're 
not allowed to enter adult 
establishments. "If I could let 
18, 19, or 20 year-olds in ,I'd 
let them in by the truckloads. 
They're at the toughest age 
socially," admitted the Old 
Del Mar Cafe General 
Manager. 

Even though night club 
managers sympathize with 
you, they still won't let you 
into their night clubs. So what 
are the alternatives? Well, 

Easy Bein' Me." 
The final papers were just 

signed for a cable special that 
Seinfeld hopes to have 
finished by next spring or 
summer. The special will be 
somewhat different from his 
normal routine, containing 
more skits and less stand,up 
comedy. Ultimately, Jerry 
Seinfeld's philosophy is if he 
is doing well with comedy, 
"why work?" 

His show on November 14 
at Mandeville will begin at 8 
pm. General admission tickets 
are available at all Ticket, 
master outlets for $10.50. 
UCSD students can purchase 
tickets at the box office for 
$7.50. 

there is Studio 9 in San Diego, 
but this still requires a 
minimum age of 18. Tijuana is 
also an alternative. Club 
"Oh, II located on Revolution 
Street in 1], is supposedly the 
best night club in the Western 
Hemisphere. and 18 is the 
drinking age in Mexico. In La 
Jolla, there's the Elephant Bar, 
El T orito, and TGI Fridays. 
You can sit at a dinner table 
and wave to your friends in 
the bar. Or if your friends are 
cool, they'll lower their 
standards and join you at your 
dinner table in the restaurant. 

So until that magical age of 
21 years rolls around, use 
your college ingenuity to find 
other creative and fun ways to 
spend your social hours. Two 
or three years isn't that long to 
wait. Besides, the bar scene 
gets old quickl y. It will roll 
around before you know it.
