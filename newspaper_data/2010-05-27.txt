SHOULD STUDENT 
FEES FUND JUSTICE IN 
PALESTINE WEEK?

Cost of Campus Parking Permits May Increase

By Jerry To
Contributing Writer

The cost of parking permits could rise next year — a result of the UCSD Transportation 
and Parking Services’ $3 million fund-
ing deficit. After a $25 student fee 
designed to fund UCSD’s ailing shuttle 
service was rejected by the student 

council in February, the Transportation 
Policy committee looks to tighten 
parking regulations through a series of 
policy changes this week, including the 
elimination of free weekend parking 
between the hours of 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.

“They expect to make about 
$250,000 a year from that move,” A.S. 
Transfer Senator and Transportation 
Policy Committee member Adam 
Powers said.

If Vice Chancellor of Resource 
Management and Planning Gary 
Matthews approves the proposal, the 
department will also increase the cost 
of short-term parking permits. The 
occasional-use “S” student parking per-

mit or “S” permit — good for 10 days 
of parking — is expected to increase 
by $10, as well as quarterly night and 
weekend permits. The cost of one-day 
parking permits would increase from 
$8 to $9 and $3 to $5.

“Right now, it’s parking money 
that pays for the shuttle service,” TPS 
Director Brian d’Autremont said. “It’s 
also the parking money that pays for 
Metropolitan Transit Service bus route. 
So basically, the additional money 
would go toward people riding buses.”

D’Autremont said that higher 
enrollment — as well as an expected 

A $3 million deficit means 
commuters may shoulder 
increased costs for next 
year’s parking service.

Four Cabinet 
Positions
Still Vacant

By Regina Ip
Associate News Editor

The new A.S. Council — voted into office early 
this quarter — entered last night’s meeting prepared 
to vote in a roster of new associate vice presidents, 
only to leave four of the 10 positions empty. 

According to a college senator on one of the 10 
AVP selection committees who wished to remain 
anonymous, the remaining 
appointments were tabled over 
concerns about the candidates’ 
lack of experience.

AVPs are responsible 
for closely managing key 
council responsibilities such as 
organizing the annual Sun God 
Festival and allocating money to 
student organizations.

The selection committees, each consisting of 
three to four council senators and the outgoing 
AVP, review the candidates’ applications then 
present their appointment recommendations to the 
president and the three vice presidents.

Among the candidates who were approved as 
scheduled were 2009-10 Marshall College Senator 
Brian McEuen, nominated for AVP of Enterprise 
Operations by Vice President of Finance and 
Resources Andrew Ang. 

Eleanor Roosevelt College Senator Pauline 
Nuth was selected as AVP of Athletic Relations 
after a recommendation from VP of Student Life 
Kristina Pham. Nuth will oversee programs like 
Triton Tide. 

Marshall College junior Alyssa Peace and 
Eleanor Roosevelt College senior Brian Wong — 
both also Pham’s picks — were selected to serve as 
AVP of Diversity and AVP of Concerts and Events, 
respectively.

A.S. President Wafa Ben Hassine and 
Vice President of Finance and Resources 
Andrew Ang presented a first draft of the 
2010-11 fiscal budget to the A.S. Council 
last night — a plan that includes newly 
instated A.S. senator stipends and expands 
the council’s graphic-design and web-devel-
opment positions. 

Next year’s budget is based on a pro-
jected revenue of $2,624,766.21 — most of 
which will be generated by the quarterly 
$47 activity fee paid by every student. Of 
this budget, the council has allocated all but 
$219,505.09 among its various offices and 
services. 

According to Ben Hassine, she and Ang 
followed the Fall Revise budget-planning 
process — the same system utilized last year 
by then-A.S. President Utsav Gupta. Under 

the Fall Revise system, they created an ini-
tial budget that postpones the allocating of 
funds to a pre-determined set of items. The 
council will then finalize the budget during 
Week Three of Fall Quarter. 

“This is only the initial budget,” she said. 
“It’s the spring budget that covers summer 

through Week Three of fall.”
Ang said it was necessary 

to use the Fall Revise system 
in order for council execu-
tives to draft the most accu-
rate budget possible. 

“I’m really in favor of the 
Fall Revise,” he said. “We don’t 
know how many people will 

be attending —  we allocated for [a total 
enrollment of] 21,850, but there could be 
more. and that would change our budget. 
The Fall Revise makes sure that we don’t

The beginning of the end — for me, anyway — began with an appearance on behalf of 
the co-ops. Members of the General 
Store, the Che Cafe, the Food Co-op 
and Groundwork Books came to 
petition support for a resolution that 
would allocate money to the co-ops 
for accountant reports and financial 
reviews.

Melissa Ewart, the A.S. Graphic 
Studio manager,  
introduced her 
student team 
and held an 
impromptu 
photo shoot for 
use in future 
marketing 
campaigns.

Former AVP of Concerts and 
Events Alex Bramwell suggested that 
some A.S. positions should be paid, 
bitterly informing the council that he 
worked 79 unpaid hours during Week 
Seven in his quest for the perfect 
Sun God Festival. He added that the 
council was losing people to places 
like the Loft, which pays its staff.

Students from the Native 
American Student Alliance 
complained that students dressed 
in stereotypical Native American 
clothing on the day of Sun God 
Festival, and that they found it both 
“disrespectful and offensive.” 

Former campuswide senator 
Tobias Haglund came to tie up loose 
ends about the A.S. store, which had 
been his pet project while he was still 
in office. Listeners were allowed to put 
in their two cents about the name of 
the future store — Triton Outfitters 
ultimately beat The Lighthouse as the 
top choice.

Even with the dreaded and 
inescapable Week Nine budget 
discussion for Fall Quarter 2010 
looming in the near future, 

councilmembers still spent over two 
hours arguing over the minutia of 
the Student Sustainability Collective 
charter language.

The debate began when workers 
from the Sustainability Resource 
Center presented their objectives for 
the newly opened environmentally-
geared space, and then asked to change 
four lines of their charter.  However, 
AVP of Enterprise Operations Rishi 

Ghosh sent out 
the e-mail with the 
amendments to the 
council listserv a 
mere hour before he 
wanted the ten-page 
document to be 
passed. 

Most 
councilmembers were confused by 
what, exactly, the proposed changes 
were. After a motion to table failed, 
Ghosh begged the council to debate 
the issue tonight. 

“A.S.’s culture that I’ve seen in the 
last few weeks is to table things, but 
it’s not efficient and is disrespectful for 
those that work on it,” Ghosh said.

Most of the amendments revolved 
around the TGIF (The Green 
Initiative Fund), and what will happen 
to the initiative’s money if it is not 
spent during the year.

After councilmembers unraveled 
their confusion for two hours, the 
amendments passed. 

AVP of Athletic Relations Donald 
Zelaya reminded council how 
athletic our sports teams really are, 
despite UCSD’s bookish reputation 
and apparent lack of school spirit. 
He wished congratulations on the 
baseball and track teams for reaching 
national competition.

In the campus affairs committee 
meeting prior to the council meeting, 
voting on the associate vice president 
positions was tabled until next week.

Was Albert Einstein a wise man 
because of his intelligence? Did 
Mother Teresa’s spirituality make 
her wise? 

These are the type of questions 
that UCSD researchers are try-
ing to answer in a new study that 
attempts to define the abstraction 
we call wisdom. According to their 
findings, wisdom is not limited to 
a high IQ quotient or moral righ-
teousness, but is a form of advanced 
cognitive and emotional develop-
ment based on experience that can 
be learned and increased with age. 

“Not all intelligent people are 
wise — somebody can be intel-
ligent and yet not wise,” psychiatry 
and neurosciences professor Dilip 
Jeste said.  “A wise person usually 
has some spiritual traits — not reli-
gious traits — in a sense that a wise 
person is compassionate, empathic 
[and] altruistic like a spiritual per-
son. But not all spiritual people are 
wise though, [because the] person 
doesn’t have to be highly educated 
or intelligent to be spiritual. So a 
wise person is both intelligent and, 
to some extent, spiritual.”

To scientifically define wisdom 
— a trait that has traditionally been 
explored only from philosophical 
and religious points of view — 
researchers used the Google search 
engine to identify experts around 
the world who have studied wisdom 
in fields ranging from psychology 

and sociology to gerontology (the 
study of aging). They e-mailed these 
experts, asking them to participate 
in a survey on the definition of 
wisdom.

Jeste’s lab used the Delphi meth-
od, in which experts corresponded 
with the researchers on an indi-
vidual basis to let them voice their 
thoughts on wisdom anonymously 
— without dealing with the com-
mon problems of group dynamics, 
like participants influencing other 
participants’ judgments.  

The 30 experts who replied to 
the e-mail were asked to answer 
whether a set of 47 distinct person-
ality traits — including altruism 
and forgiveness — were associated 
with wisdom, intelligence and spiri-
tuality. 

The experts were asked to deter-
mine if other, more complicated 
factors — such as insight, recogniz-
ing the limits of one’s own knowl-
edge and being at peace with one’s 
eventual death  — fell under the 
category of intelligence, spirituality 
or wisdom.

Certain traits did not always 
fall under all three categories. For 
example, the results of the survey 
showed that the participants agreed 
that altruism should fall under the 
category of wisdom and spirituality, 
but not intelligence.  

“There is often overlap between 
wisdom, intelligence and spiritual-
ity,” Jeste said. “Most of the experts 
differentiated these three things. 
Some items were common to intelli-
gence and wisdom, some to spiritu-
ality and wisdom, some common to 
all three, but majority were unique 
to wisdom.”

Researchers found that wisdom 
is a uniquely human characteristic 
defined by six prominent qualities: 

general knowledge of life, emotional 
regulation, insight, helpfulness to 
others, decisiveness and tolerance of 
different values. 

“I believe wisdom is a complex 
human trait that needs to be studied 
by neuroscientists, however, there is 
no single consensus [on the] defini-
tion of wisdom,” Jeste said.

In the future, Jeste predicts that 
— with a better understanding of 
the science behind wisdom — the 
human brain will be analyzed for 
any physiological or genetic ele-
ments associated with wisdom.

Unless you’ve been cuddling rabbits in Pepper Canyon for the past month, you’ve proba-
bly noticed the ruckus on Library Walk.

Ever since the A.S. Council consid-
ered a resolution that recommended 
the University of California divest 
from companies supplying weapons to 
the Israeli military, tensions between 
Students for Justice in Palestine and 
Tritons for Israel have escalated, result-
ing in less-than-civil discussions.

When the MSA held Justice in 
Palestine Week — which took place 
May 10 to 14 and included the instal-
lation of a mock-Israeli division wall 
on Library Walk — a new flame was 
added to the fire.

In retaliation, Young Americans 
for Freedom, an otherwise unknown, 
politically conservative student org, 
invited slimeball pro-Israel commenta-
tor David Horowitz to speak on cam-
pus that same week. During a ques-
tion-and-answer session, Horowitz 
dodged a legitimate request from MSA 
member Jumanah Albahri to back his 
claim that terrorists fund her organi-
zation. He also bullied Albahri into 
agreeing she would support a mass 
genocide of Jews, simplifying the issue 
into “for or against” language.

Now, fears of anti-Semitism are 
trickling into the campus conversation, 
and TFI is asking the A.S. Council 
to stop funding Justice in Palestine 
Week, while requesting that a long list 
of departments, groups and colleges 
on campus stop endorsing the event, 
which many pro-Israel students per-
ceive as hurtful.

Is it just us, or did we already settle 
the funding debate last quarter? If 
you’ll recall, no matter how much the 

Black Student Union rallied to stop 
putting student fees toward the Koala’s 
racist jokes, the cocky marsupials are 
still printing new issues.

The information presented during 
Justice for Palestine Week — which 
does not even approach the Koala’s 
caliber of disrespect — is both emo-
tionally charged and controversial, but 
that’s all the more reason to financially 
support it.

The MSA’s mock security wall may 
have come off as shocking, but how 
often to does a passerby stop for a 
tame little info session? MSA members 
have every right to be upset about the 
human rights violations being com-
mitted against the Palestinian people 

and seeing their pain is just as valuable 
as learning the facts that have caused it 
— even if it does make the stroll down 
Library Walk a little uncomfortable.

We support the council’s fund-
ing of Justice in Palestine Week, just 
as we support its (partial) funding of 
the YAF’s distasteful guest speaker. If 
members of TFI are upset about how 
Justice in Palestine Week presented 
the facts of the conflict, we encourage 
them to take equal advantage of the 
student fees at their disposal and plan 
an event of their own. Ultimately, pub-
lic forums like these spur healthy dis-
cussion among uninformed students, 
who would otherwise spend their time 
mulling over the “Lost” finale.

While we’re on the topic of 
Horowitz, though, we’d advise students 
not to take his exchange with Albahri 
so simplistically. Of course, Jewish stu-
dents are entitled to feel threatened or 
upset by recent events on our campus, 
but it takes quite an imagination to 
believe that MSA members are out to 
kill off UCSD’s Jewish population.

Ultimately, we must remember that 
the issue at hand is the Israeli govern-
ment’s occupation of the Palestinian 
territories. But when any number of 
student groups disagrees with each 
other, they should all be given the 
means to deliver their opinions to the 
public. It’s the only way the rest of us 
might learn something.

In a Campuswide Debate, Silence Is Futile

A couple weeks ago, our much-maligned royal circle — the UC Board of Regents — stum-
bled upon two big no-brainers.

 They found that if they bought  
less office supplies for administrators, 
they could put those savings toward 
classes and professor salaries. They 
also chose to more clearly define the 
student registration fee — which was 
designed to go toward student resourc-
es — as the “Student Services Fee.” 

Nice and transparent. However, 
they also slipped some ambiguous 
language in to the fine print — lan-
guage that completely contradicts 
its upgraded name. The Student 
Service Fee can now technically to 
toward state-funded areas such as 
admissions, the registrar’s office and 
libraries. 

You win some, you lose some, and 
it’s a 50 percent positive track record in 
a year of budget shortfalls. 

A round of applause, please, for 
the board of geniuses! Office supplies? 
We’d have never thought to sacrifice 
monogrammed staplers while public 
education collapses. The plan will 
funnel $500 million of administrative 
funds into the classroom — the brain-
child of UC Chief Financial Officer 
Peter Taylor. Taylor’s first move: reduce 
$100 million in printers, paper and 
staplers  — amenities for which we 
shell out $4 billion a year.

It’s a practical, albeit obvious, 
solution; now, Taylor just needs to 
keep up the steam. He says that nine 
similar initiatives have been launched 
since 2008, but — at the first sign 
of economic upturn — everyone 
trashes their cheap schizophrenic 
copy machine for the latest laser 
printer. Though there are few signs 
that California’s $1.2 billion deficit will 
begin to fill anytime soon, we hope the 
regents can at least enforce a modest 
administrative budget, no matter how 

the financial weathervane swings. No 
public office should shine like it’s in 
the Fortune 500. After all, it’s academic 
prowess that defines our university, 
not our supply of ballpoint pens.

As for the new Student Services 
Policy, it includes all sorts of clauses 
meant to clarify where our money is 
going. Each campus will have a web-
site revealing how the fees are being 
spent, and chancellors will supposedly 
solicit student input on how much the 
fee should be. 

Ironically, this transparency won’t 
change the fact that our registra-
tion fees will now officially be able 
to go toward educational areas that 
a 2002 UC Council on Student Fees 
document deemed “inappropriate” 
for registration-fee usage. The 2002 
document provided guidelines that 
were never officially approved — but 
the official, updated version gives the 
regents permission to use our Student 
Services Fee for purposes the old 

document banned. 
We — along with Registration Fee 

Advisory Committee Chair Erik Van 
Esselstyn — are all for putting our fees 
into education rather than less essen-
tial services. When push comes to 
shove, it’s better that more money go 
toward the academic side of our col-
lege experience. At a time when wait-
lists are inflating and departments are 
facing a 20-percent cut, the classes and 
professors at the crux of our university 
can always use a little help. 

However, blurring the line between 
our registration and educational fee 
ignores the intent behind having two 
fees in the first place: When the going 
gets tough, the registration fee should 
ensure that certain services don’t see 
their funds pulled arbitrarily. To keep 
things honest, the regents should have 
just re-adjusted the two fees instead of 
making them overlap.

Van Esselstyn said it best: raise the 
educational fee, then lower the student 

service fee by the same amount. It 
seems an obvious solution — but then, 
so did those belated office-supply 
cutbacks.

What a Novel Idea: Fewer Pens, More Classes

ILLUSTRATIONS BY REBEKAH HWANG/GUARDIAN

EDITORIALS

I’m pretty sure I’m not insane, but if I were, I’d accuse the Internet of plotting to kill me. I’d also dress 
like Obi-Wan Kenobi, decorate my 
bedroom with lawn ornaments and 
scream obscenities at neighborhood 
cats — but that’s beside the point. 
Mainly, I’d focus on the Internet 
thing.

And for good reason. You see, I 
recently learned from a popular tech 
blog that two of my favorite websites 
— Facebook and Pandora — have 
begun to communicate with one 
another, sharing my personal infor-
mation behind my back without my 

knowledge or consent. 
My initial reaction: “Those moth-

erfuckers are talking shit.” However, 
after quickly suppressing my natural 
gangster rage, I realized that the 
situation was far more serious. They 
weren’t just talking — they were 
talking about my taste in music. 
Facebook tells Pandora what bands 
I like, and Pandora tells me what I 
should be listening to based on those 
bands. 

Assholes. Who do they think 
they are? Spying on me? Selling my 
information to one another? Telling 
me I should listen to more Arcade 
Fire? I’d expect this kind of think 
from Facebook, who is generally kind 
of a bitch-ass anyway, but Pandora? 
What the hell, Man? I thought we 
were cool. 

It gets worse. 
Shortly after discovering this 

harrowing betrayal, I logged onto 
Pandora and was confronted with a 
small pop-up bubble at the bottom 
of my screen. It informed me that my 
old friend Lisa — who I hadn’t spo-
ken to since high school — was a fan 
of the song I was listening to.

“Lisa likes this song,” Pandora 
said, like some demon-possessed car-
nival attraction before, presumably, 
feasting on the soul of a baby giraffe. 

I was mortified. The robots were 
taking over. I had to save Lisa.

She picked up after two rings.
“Hello?”
“Lisa! You like the song ‘In Ear 

Park’ by Department of Eagles, don’t 
you?”

“Yeah, I love that song.”
“You know how I know?”
“How?”
“Because Pandora told me!”
“Oh. Cool.”
“Doesn’t that freak you out?”
“Not really.”
“Oh. Well, uh … What did you 

think of the ‘Lost’ finale?”
“I never watched that show.”
Maybe she wasn’t worth saving, 

after all. Regardless, it was clear that 
Lisa and I had been out of touch for 
a while — a fact that I immediately 
remedied by browsing her Facebook 
page for several minutes. Turns out 
she studied abroad in Spain, her 
birthday is in November and she’s still 
interested in men. Super. I love catch-
ing up with old friends.

Here’s what I don’t love about old 
friends: the fact that those unbearable 
weirdos can now view all my Pandora 
stations at will. At will! That means 
whenever they want. I’m not saying 
I have anything to hide, but I don’t

exactly go around advertising the fact 
that I still listen to Cursive some-
times. Because I don’t. I swear.

What it all comes down to is pri-
vacy. I currently have a total of 763 
Facebook friends, approximately 500 
of whom I haven’t seen in person 
for at least a year, and approximately 
200 of whom I don’t like very much 
at all but feel obligated to maintain 
an Internet-based friendship with 
because we did some half-assed 
group project together in a class 
whose name I’ve already forgotten. 
Though I have no real desire to be 
in contact with any of these people, 
we are now linked inextricably by 
our presence on the Internet, simply 
because we frequent a couple of the 

same websites. The Internet is forc-
ing me to find commonalities with 

my pseudo-
friends and 
— to connect 
with them 
through 
our musical 
interests — 
when all I 
really want 
is to distance 
myself from 
these people 
as much as 
possible and 
occasion-

ally glance through their Facebook 
albums while I wait for my Hulu vid-
eos to buffer. 

The Facebook-Pandora alliance 
does nothing to make my life better. 
It doesn’t enrich my music-listening 
experience, or enhance my personal-
ity, or make me more handsome. 
What it does is tell me that my friend 
Daniel — an individual whose taste in 
music I have always deeply respected 
— has been listening to a lot of Black 
Eyed Peas recently, which makes me 
respect him a whole lot less. If a man 
wants to listen to terrible, terrible 
music, he should be able to do so in 
the privacy of his own home, free 
from intrusion and ridicule. 

The Internet is stalking us, watch-
ing us, learning our habits and pre-
paring meticulously for the impend-
ing robot revolution. Or something. 
Get out while you can. 

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
It’s amazing how people can see 

one event so differently.  
Myra Meskin, a member of Tritons 

for Israel, submitted a letter to the 
Guardian on May 17 about how 
a member of the Muslim Student 
Association “stood up in a public 
forum and announced her support for 
Hamas and Hezbollah” at an event on 
May 10th.  

It’s so sad to see such a misrepre-
sentation of what happened that night, 
even leaving out the actual context 
of the event. Tritons for Israel (who 
initially supported the event, then 
later pulled out), Young Americans for 
Freedom and the College Republicans 
invited the right-wing pundit David 
Horowitz to speak on campus in 
support of Israel during Justice in 
Palestine Week.  

During his speech, Horowitz 
labeled it “Hitler Youth Week” and 
falsely accused the MSA of being a ter-
rorist arm of the Muslim Brotherhood. 
The student who asked the question 
to Horowitz never said that she sup-
ported either Hamas or Hezbollah, but 
rather simply asked Horowitz to clarify 
his claim about the MSA. 

In response, Horowitz went on 
to call members of the MSA at uni-
versities throughout the country 
“terrorists,” and disgustingly called 
the woman a “terrorist” for wearing a 
keffiyeh (scarf) around her neck. He 

then cut her off and asked her to leave, 
and the mainly white, middle-aged 
audience booed her. Some yelled, “We 
don’t want you here.” Meskin talked 
about racism in her letter to the edi-
tor, and that is indeed what I saw that 
night against this woman on our cam-
pus, as a representative from the uni-
versity administration just stood by. 

While attending the event, I was 
extremely upset by what happened, 
and it is only more angering to see 
someone misrepresent the situation. 
Racism does exist in the form of anti-
Semitism — I have experienced it — 
but it also exists because of individuals 
like David Horowitz, who seize upon 
fear and stereotypes of others to attack 
them. 

What is needed on this campus 
more than anything else is dialogue 
— so that individuals can listen to 
one another, find out where they are 
coming from and open their minds as 
a result — rather than spreading mes-
sages of hate.

NEWS� THURSDAY, MAY 27, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 7 

Vice President of External Affairs 
Michael Lam’s pick for AVP of Local 
Affairs, junior Matthew Vu, was also 
approved by the council.

Former Campuswide Senator 
Carli Thomas was appointed AVP of 
Student Organizations, following a 
recommendation by Vice President of 
Finance and Resources Andrew Ang. 

Thomas will serve as the liaison 
between the A.S. Council and the 
nearly 500 student organizations on 
campus. She will make an allotment 
recommendation to the A.S. Finance 
committee for each request she receives 
from student orgs — a process she 
hopes to reform next year.

“It’s really important for student 
orgs to have a chance to program and 
do whatever they want during the 
school year [that] their organization 
[is] running, but at the same, there’s 
only so much money,” Thomas said. 

A vote on Ang’s pick for AVP 
Student Services, former AVP Student 
Services Meredith Madnick, was tabled 
indefinitely.

Pham said she chose Wong for the 
position of AVP Concerts and Events 
because of his experience working as 
a production coordinator within the 
office this year. In his new role, he will 
be responsible for planning events like 
the annual Sun God Festival, FallFest 
and Bear Gardens.

Wong said that he would like to see 
a greater level of student contribution 
in choosing which booths, vendors and 
performers will be featured at next 
year’s Sun God Festival. 

Wong also said he is unsure what 
next year’s festival lineup will look like. 

“Given this year’s lineup, it’s been 
totally hard to get feedback from the 
students, because if you look on the 
Facebook page for Sun God, there’s 
quite a few negative reviews,” Wong 

said. “Yet the event sold out, so it’s hard 
to gauge how popular the acts are.”

Peace said she hopes to increase 
the number of underrepresented 
minorities on campus by supporting 
yield programs that host overnight 
events for admitted high-school 
seniors, but added that her work will 
not focus solely on racial issues.

Two of the candidates chosen by A.S. 
President Wafa Ben Hassine — former 
AVP of Local Affairs Aries Yumul for 
the position of AVP of College Affairs 
and former Campuswide Senator 
Desiree Prevo for the position of AVP 
of Academic Affairs — were voted 
down by the council.

Ben Hassine’s pick for AVP of 
Student Advocacy, Eleanor Roosevelt 
College sophomore Arohi Sharma, was 
tabled indefinitely.

have the wrong allocation. I didn’t 
finish meeting with orgs, and we 
need more time to solidify and clarify 
the allocations.”

New allocations in the budget 
include a $10 weekly stipend for 
the council’s 29 senators — which 
will amount to $8,700 by the end 
of the year. In addition, several line 
items have been added to various 
offices, such as $2,400 reserved for 
the American Indian Recruitment 
program under the Office of External 
Affairs. 

The budget also accounts for the 
council’s new staff positions; most 
notably, graphic artist and website 
developer. Last year, there were only 
three graphic artists, while next year, 
five additional graphic artists will 
be hired. In addition, a computer-
support position has been created. 

According to Ang, this is because 
designers and webmasters will be 
working throughout the summer to 
overhaul the A.S. website. 

Campus media organizations 
received $30,000 in preliminary 
funding, whereas last year’s spring 
budget allocated an initial amount 
of only $20,000 to such organiza-
tions. Ang said this change is meant 
to accommodate the revised media 
funding guidelines passed on May 
5, which created a cap of $4,000 per 
quarter for quarterly publications 
and $6,000 per year for annual pub-
lications. 

He said that — because the 
new guidelines allow media orgs to 
request additional emergency fund-
ing — he wanted to ensure that coun-
cil had the necessary funds. 

“However, I can guarantee that 
the final budget will not fall below 

$45,000,” Ang said. 
A.S. Concerts and Events received 

$751,500 for 2010-11 programming, 
including $30,000 for Bear Gardens 
in Fall Quarter and $550,000 for next 
year’s Sun God Festival   — the same 
amount allocated for this year’s fes-
tival. 

Ang said that one of his goals is to 
have minimum carry-forward — or 
excess student fees — left over at the 
end of Spring Quarter 2011. 

“I don’t want to have a large car-
ry-forward,” he said. “These are the 
student fees that students this year 
pay, and it should go back to them 
this year.”

As of press time, the council had 
not finalized deliberations on the bud-
get.

increase in the cost of ridership on 
MTS buses — prompted the depart-
ment to seek new sources of revenue.

“We really do try hard to keep pric-
es down, recognizing tuition is going 
up and everything else,” d’Autremont 
said. “It’s going to be a constant struggle 
with the budget system. But at least 
what we’re doing is keeping pollution 
out of the air.”

Additionally, the committee has 
proposed the creation of “premium 
parking lots” within structures like 
Pangea and the Sixth College lot, where 
people would pay more to park in 
reserved spots.

Powers said that higher parking 
prices will likely push drivers towards 
public transportation, thus defeating 
the purpose of the price increase.

“If they go from the people paying 
into the system to the people using the 
resources of a system, you’re sort of 
being hit twice,” Powers said.

The department is also consider-
ing cutting from the MTS subsidies, 
which allow students to ride city buses 
at a free or significantly decreased 
price.

Powers said that a large number of 
low-income students depend on the 
MTS buses to get to campus, and are 
therefore opposed to this proposal.

One other suggestion has been 
to cut from campus shuttle services, 
which cost about $5 million per year 
to run. Roughly 5,000 people use the 
shuttles daily — which is 2,600 more 
than the ridership of five years ago. 

D’Autremont said that, although the 
MTS and shuttle cuts would gener-
ate enough revenue to eliminate the 
$3 million deficit in about a year, the 
department is looking to changes in the 
parking system before any reduction in 
public transportation.

D’Autremont said that if the pro-
posal to increase the cost of parking 
permits is not accepted by Matthews, 

and no changes are made, the depart-
ment would be forced to reduce shuttle 
services.

“Since we don’t have funding from 
anything else, all we can do is cut costs 
or increase revenue,” d’Autremont said. 
“The only revenue comes from park-
ing, so that’s the only revenue we can 
increase — unless we have an agree-
ment to charge for public transporta-
tion.”

The numbers of shuttles and 
employees in the department were 
already decreased significantly over the 
past year. D’Autremont said he has cut 
19 out of 100 employees who were on 
the permanent payroll.

“We used to run 52 buses, but now 
we only run 40, and we haul 2,500 extra 
people a day,” D’Autremont said. 

According to d’Autremont, the 
only alternative to cutting services 
or increasing permit costs would be 
to re-introduce the proposed $25 
Transportation Referendum — which 
was defeated last quarter by coun-
cilmembers hoping to find alternate 
forms of funding for the department.

D’Autremont said he does not know 
if another referendum is likely in the 
future.

“I thought that ... after working 
for three full years with three differ-
ent A.S. governments, that we had a 
wonderful chance at going forward,” 
d’Autremont said. “What we have 
asked from Transportation Services 
is that Associated Students let the 
student body vote on it. I don’t think 
this is something that should be shut 
down at the A.S. government level.”

The next TPC meeting will take 
place during Fall Quarter, when the 
committee will decide whether to go 
ahead with the proposed changes in 
service services or continue to pursue a 
student fee referendum.

THIS WEEK ON CAMPUSHIATUS PICKS THE WEEK’S BEST BETS

What better way to celebrate your pending graduation and entrance 
into the adult world than under the lights of Mission Valley with a 
band called Nashville Pussy? With brawls-n-booze lyrics set to 
thrashing guitars and Blaine Cartwright’s shredded, twangy vocals, 
Pussy’s packing some serious double-barreled Dixie charm that even 
Lynyrd Skynyrd a la “Gimme Three Steps” couldn’t match. (MP)

9 THE UCSD GUARDIAN  

Move Over, 
Ke$ha: I’m 
Graduating
I hope all you brats out there with slam-dunk lookalikes had fun dur-ing doppelganger week. I hope 
you sat around all day admiring the 
bombshell in your profile picture and 
racking up “likes” and OMGs for a 
comment thread so fat it’s still No. 1 
on my News Feed. I hope you enjoyed 
it — because doppelganger week did 
not go so swell this side of the tracks.

After a string of disheartening 
suggestions — including such stun-
ners as Courtney Love, Garth from 
“Wayne’s World” and that chick who 
was banging Scott Peterson — one of 
my coworkers (apparently not needing 
a letter of recommendation anytime in 

the future) informed the entire news-
room that he had finally stumbled 
upon my true doppelganger: the 
morning-after scarecrow behind such 
grrrl-power party hits as “Tik Tok,” 
“Blah Blah Blah” and “Your Love Is My 
Drug” — each chronologically more 
likely to kill brain cells than the last.

Although I’m 99 percent positive 
he only made the Ke$ha connection 
because my hair is always so fucked 
up (unless he also snooped the mini 
bottles of Jack lining my medicine cabi-
net), said editor did inspire me to more 
closely investigate the talentless twenty-
something’s freak rise to fame. I braved 
her three-video YouTube dominion, 
her Saturday Night Live disaster and a 
few excruciating interviews. 

“I’m just honest about the things 
I believe in,” Ke$ha said to Interview 
Magazine. “For instance, I went yester-
day to a past-life regressionist, and he 
told me that in my past life I was assas-
sinated. I’m pretty sure that I was JFK 
in my past life.”

Does that mean my doppelganger  
actually gets to be JFK? I fucking hope 
so. Above all, though, dearest Ke$ha 
got me thinking: Maybe the career 
path of filthy-rich superstar is not as 
farfetched as I once imagined.

I mean, I’m already headed for 
Los Angeles. Once a loyal NorCal 
warrior quick to decry my southern 
counterparts, I now know there’s shitty 
people at both poles — but at least the 
ones down here don’t think they were 
chosen by god to relive the ’60s on 25 
times the budget. At least in SoCal, 
everyone’s just trying to have a good 
time. So the Bay’s out. That said, San 
Diego, admittedly, is not exactly the 
doofy surf-bro niche to which I want to 
culturally condemn myself. So LA it is.

A few months ago, my post-grad 
plan of action was to elope north with 
my trusty laptop, no doubt stepping 
straight into the life of Hank Moody 
from “Californication.” I would soon 
strike it rich by selling my grungy 
heartbreak novel to an unhip studio 
giant; from there, it’d be one big blur of 
sand, sun, good beer and choice group-
ies with a taste for dry wit. Amen.

However, the apparent dip in 
demand for slightly slackerish free-
lancers has forced me to consider sell-
ing out in a much bigger way. And it 
won’t be as difficult as I once thought: 
Ke$ha, wise mentor that she is, has 
shown me that all I have to do is capi-
talize on my faults. Let me count the 
reasons why I — raised by wolves in 
a wild manzanita grove (plus one for 
quirky backstory) — will be the next 
big thing out of the ’Wood.

SIMONE ELECTRA WILSON
siwilson@ucsd.edu

See NARROW, page 11

H oled up with a line of bizarre instruments in an old rural mansion in upstate New York — 
instead of the urban apartment that 
birthed most of their past successes — 
Mike Stroud and Evan Mast laid down 
the tracks for their sixth album in as 
many years. The departure from such 
a winning protocol may have been 
risky, but given the indie duo’s love of 
exploration, a shift from routine was 
in the cards.

The electro-rockers typically trade 
out standard vocals for such oddities 
as bird chirps, wildcat screams and 
German voiceovers — a trend that 
continues throughout LP4. The pair 
devised the album during the same 
recording sessions that wrought LP3 
two years ago; they divided the tracks 
between the former and its brand-new 
sibling.

While its title is a decidedly lat-
eral move, LP4 expounds on the 
otherworldly aesthetic honed on LP3 
— weaving an unfamiliar body of 
global exoticism into LP3’s clean-cut 
sound. The latest incorporates a tribal 
backbeat and — for the first time — a 
full string section, building upon the 
vanilla-synth lightness of its 2008 pre-
decessor.

An excess of dicing, reversing and 
layering makes it difficult to discern 
which instruments are responsible 
for the group’s new Eastern twang.  
However, the notable reintroduction 
of Stroud’s heavy guitar rifts — in con-
trast to the rock-emaciated LP3 — is a 
welcome taste of a signature style that 
plumpened more popular full-lengths 
Classics and Ratatat like well-spread 
butter.

“Sunblocks” typifies the duo’s new 
vamp: A tinkering melody builds into 
a thunderous wail. Tracks “Drugs” and 
“Party with Children” have a similar 
effect — shifting from lurching, eerily 
sober beginnings to full-bodied elec-
tronic symphonies.

Sure, LP4 is technically a cheat: 
The title practically owns up to the fact 
that these are the dregs of 2008. But 
that’s precisely what makes LP4 great. 
Its self-contained identity somehow 
manages to encapsulate vintage Ratatat 
without collapsing into a creative rut.

or such a sizable production, there isn’t a whole lot going on in “To 
Be Sung” — the latest chamber opera to fill the Conrad Prebys Music 
Center in song. All that sits onstage — awaiting the cast before the 
opening notes — are a couple of big, white origami … things. They 
really don’t look like much. For that reason, though, nothing could 
better exemplify the performance to come.

There is no discernable plot in “To Be Sung,” nor are there any 
particularly strong characters to identify with. Take away the music, and you’re once 
again alone with those glowing white lanterns.  But don’t run away just yet — theirs 
may be an obvious foray into abstract, head-scratching territory, but a world of mean-
ingless insight can be gained from the grad-student opera. 

Composed by French luminary Pascal Dusapin in 1993, the production has 
since been re-imagined more than 50 times throughout Europe. Now that director 

(and original cast member) Susan 
Nurucki is teaming up with the 
Kallisti Ensemble — an experimen-
tal group of chamber-opera grad 
students at UCSD — “To Be Sung” 
is finally seeing its West Coast pre-
miere. 

The opera begins with a soli-
tary figure (UCSD Professor Philip 
Larson) at the center of the stage, a 
purple spotlight bringing him out 
of complete darkness. In his best 
Tom Waits growl, Larson describes 
a vase, a lamp and an arm chair. He 
then leaves the stage to sit with the 
orchestra and provide nonsensical 
commentary that refuses to indulge 
our grasps at a storyline.

Meanwhile, a group of four 
women (Stephanie Aston, Tiffany 
Du Mouchelle, Leslie Ann Leytham 
and Meghann Welsh) congregate 
around the stage, and — like their 
omniscient narrator — let out a 
stream of jumbled, indiscernible 
abstractions. 

“Two walking!” shouts godlike 
orator Larson sporadically through-
out the show. The girls are even less 
relateable in their high (and perfect) 
pitch: “A cuckoo bird!” 

If it’s any consolation, the gibber-
ish does make more sense when the source material is revealed. The opera is adapted 
from the libretto of American modernist Gertrude Stein’s “A Lyrical Opera Made By 
Two.” Stein isn’t exactly known for her comprehensive plots; the writer notably translat-
ed Cubist painters like Picasso into literary form, creating striking word portraits made 
to evoke feelings rather than follow literal storylines.  

Dusapin’s opera follows suit. 
The set’s notable cubism and cast’s nonsensical turns of phrase are meant to repre-

sent the relationships and desires of the four women. 
“Sometimes the women are demanding to be kissed; sometimes they are showing 

off,; sometimes they are just lost,” Nurucki explained.

10�THE UCSD GUARDIAN� THURSDAY, MAY 27, 2010� HIATUS

T here’s a steep price of entry to direc-tor Michael Patrick King’s followup to 2008’s Sex and the City: For any sem-
blance of enjoyment, you’ll have to buy into 
Carrie Bradshaw and friends’ glimmering 
unreality of impromptu private-jet getaways 
and $22,000-a-night hotel suites. But boy, 
does it glimmer. 

Don’t be fooled by the title, though: Not 
only do the sex scenes number exactly two 
(and offer little in the way of pity female 
nudity for the husbands and boyfriends in 
the crowd), the bulk of the film takes place 
6,000 miles from New York City in Abu 
Dhabi, displacing the fabulous foursome 
far from their cosmo-twirling, bed-hopping 
origins into a conservative Muslim society 
— but more on that later. 

Picking up two 
years after the first 
installment left off, 
we meet Carrie and 
Co. at the wedding of 
— hey, why not? — Charlotte and Carrie’s 
respective gay besties. In case the bowtied 
show choir and pond of white swans grac-
ing the ceremony aren’t decadent enough, 
Liza Minelli swoops in to both officiate as 
rabbi and perform a rousing rendition of 
Beyonce’s “Single Ladies (Put a Ring on 
It)” — giving way, of course, to shimmying 
backup dancers and a swooning crowd.

It’s a telling taste of the extravagant alter-
nate universe in which the girls have always 
existed, but the wedding also marks the 
spot at which everything starts to unravel. 

After a remark from a 
stranger on her childless 
marriage, Carrie starts 
to question the relation-
ship it took her six TV 

seasons and one hapless big-screen adapta-
tion to land. 

When Charlotte, Miranda and even 
Samantha begin to show some signs of wear 
from decidedly grown-up threats to their 
happiness (ranging from menopause to a 
bra-less nanny), it’s time for a change — in 
the form an all-expense-paid trip to Abu 
Dhabi, courtesy of a generous sheikh who 
happens to want Samantha’s help in pro-
moting his new, impossibly over-the-top

W hile accordion monkey Johnny Depp is on hiatus until the fourth “Pirates” installment, mega-produc-er Jerry Bruckheimer is trading in the Caribbean for 
ancient Persia in his latest kid-friendly action flick, “Prince 

of Persia: The Sands of 
Time.” But it seems — with 
a tendency to drown itself in 
prolonged action sequences 
rather than explore new 
sands — “Prince” may just 
find itself in Davy Jones’ 
locker even sooner than 
Captain Jack.

Based loosely on a 2003 
video game of the same name, “Prince” opens in the desert 
dunes of sixth-century Persia. Orphaned street rat Dastan 
(Will Foster) catches the eye of King Sharaman (Ronald 
Pickup) in the marketplace, and — after being adopted — 
soon matures into the buff-biceped Jake Gyllenhaal.

Like the prince of Egypt, this prince is raised with the 
King’s natural-born sons, while Sharaman’s brother Nizam 
(Ben Kingsley) serves as token shady advisor to the court,

resort. 
As soon as the ladies land in the 

Middle East, the requisite culture 
clash results: Charlotte whines that 
her iPhone won’t work; Miranda 
butchers her tour-guide Arabic; 
Samantha won’t dream of covering 
her 52-year-old chest. A string of 
puns — varying in cringe-worthiness 
from “Lawrence of my labia” to “bed, 
bath and Bedouin” — don’t do much 
to help the ladies’ cause. In fact, the 
film’s simplistic depiction of modern 

Abu Dhabi has already yielded criti-
cism from the United Arab Emirates’ 
National Media Council. 

Of course, in every respect that 
really matters in this $95 million ode 
to extravagance — sassy dialogue, 
male eye candy and, most impor-

producer-director King delivers. 
And delivers. And delivers. Until 
— one arrest, 142 minutes and 2,000

to muster much sympathy for this 
whiny, overindulged foursome.

THEATERPREVIEW Our New Play Spectacular
UNDERGRADUATE THEATER FESTIVAL
ARTHUR WAGNER THEATRE
MAY 27 TO JUNE 5

FREAK SHOWCASE
By Leila Haghighat
Staff Writer

Two ordinary actors lug a pile of ordinary clothes onto the ordi-nary stage of the Arthur Wagner 
Theatre. But once you learn they’ve 
got a prostitute inside the pile, it’s clear 
that undergraduate theater festival 
“Our New Play Spectacular,” will be 
anything but ordinary.

Currently in its seventh year, the 
festival showcases UCSD’s riskiest tal-
ent in the form of playwrites, actors 
and directors. Altogether, over 40 
undergraduates translate student-
penned pieces from page to stage in 
what artistic director and Marshall 
College senior Spencer Howard 
described as “replicating life at a 
heightened level.”

The fest is composed of four plays, 

categorized by theme. Showcase A 
dwells on the apocalypse in “Acid 
Rain” and “Freak Show,” while 
Showcase B dabbles in entrapment 
with “Animal Animal” and “Wigs.”

In “Wigs,” salacious protagonist 
Lulu talks in verse amid a chaotic 
wreckage of clothing, caution tape, 
toilet paper rolls and a Barbie doll. 
Over her corseted bridal gown, Lulu 
sports a Marilyn Monroe screen T, 
offset by a Lady Gaga-inspired noose 
of hair around her neck. The costume 
is a juxtaposition of 18th-century 
pomp against modern pop culture, a 
la Sofia Coppola’s “Marie Antoinette” 
— the noose serving as an extension 
of the entrapment theme. 

For all their allusions to the past, 
the pieces in the festival balance 
their nostalgia by diving into current 
affairs. “Animal” explores the cellar 

lives of the wife and children of Josef 
“rapist of his own daughter, who 
he kept in a basement” Fritzl, while 
Howard’s “American Apparel” pro-
files the titular company’s CEO Dov 
Charney — whose free-trade business 
standards parallel his equally liberal 
sex life. To explore the character of a 
man who Howard calls an “eccentric 
and hedonistic type of person,” the 
play centers on Charney’s nonplussed 
director of communications, who 
confronts Charney with an article in 
“Jane” magazine that describes him 
walking around his office naked and 
masturbating while being interviewed.   

Howard said he had no difficulty 
translating the imagery to stage.

“If the storytelling on the page is 
engaging, then it would be difficult 
to lose that when you’re doing it on 
stage,” he said.

1) I’ll be living in a cardboard 
box. (Until my record company starts 
making it rain, of course). This will 
provide for sufficiently nappy jeans 
and a whole host of catchy anecdotes 
about hardcore street liquids with 
which I am forced to brush my teeth. 
Since I’ll be rather young and attrac-
tive by bum standards, I’ll probably 
even reap enough coinage for a music-
video handycam and glow-in-the-dark 
bodypaint. I may need a pro-bono 
boob job, though. Know anyone good?

2) I somehow sing even worse 
than Ke$ha — meaning convertibles 
brimming in16-year-olds will be even 
more inclined to drown me out with 
hairbrush-in-rearview renditions. Also 
— though it’s a lesser-appreciated talent 
 — bitch ain’t got shit on my smoker’s 
cough. Think about it: Nothing can 
unlock memories of last night’s six-
footer like some rib-rattling aveoli on 
the beat (or “the telltale cough,” as the 
News girls call it when I’m doing edits). 
Now imagine what kind of studio 
magic I could make with a stethescope.

3) From there, being $imone won’t 
be much more complicated than 
alternating my Coachella and Burning 
Man outfits every other week while 
turning all Uffie’s stiletto stories into 
the common whore’s walk-of-shame 
equivelents. Pretty soon, I’ll be chillin’ 
in the control room with P. Diddy, Lil 
Jon and LMFAO, cackling into our 
crystal balls while the masses swarm to 
“Shots!” like dying flies to hot shit.

So please — stop asking what I’m 
doing when I graduate. Because now 
you know: I’m doing it big.

With each action and emotion 
the women try to represent, the 
music and lighting change as well. 
Their words don’t tell us much at all, 
but a veritable mix of emotions still 
shines through.

“You can’t understand the words, 
but you can understand the feelings,” 
Nurucki said. 

The music is as frenzied as the 
expressions, moving from somber, 
wilting notes to jazzy bass over 
screeching oboe and menacing 
trombone. The female voices layer 
themselves — one over another — 
into a chaotic pulse, drawing out sin-
gular words and morphing them into 
distorted harmonies. Combined with 
colorful, shifting lights, the room 
becomes a schizophrenic trip.

Those white lanterns don’t seem 
so out of place anymore. 

“To Be Sung” clearly isn’t for 
everyone. For the minority of audi-
ence members with the patience and 
arty enthusiasm to sit through 70 
minutes of challenging nonsense, the 
kaleidoscope of light and sound will 
be an inspiration; the rest will find 
themselves in over their heads. 

ever-aloof and draped with ulterior motives.
When the Persians lay siege to Alamut (a scene 

loaded in maximum CGI glory), Dastan snags the 
Dagger of Time. Unbeknownst to him, when the 
ruby on its hilt is pressed, the dagger reverses the 
passage of time.

Princess Tamina of Alamut (Gemma Arterton) 
begins to unravel the mythological significance of 
the dagger — meanwhile falling in love, Disney-
style, with Dastan, after an abundance of not-so-
witty hard-to-get banter. When Dastan is wrongly 
accused of the king’s death, the tentative lovers 
band together to keep the dagger from villainous 
hands that could bring on a sandstorm capable of 

obliterating the world. Cue histrionic strings of 
doom with the metronomic precision of a snoozing 
alarm clock.

For all his Spidey moves across the rooftops of a 
makeshift Agrabah, Dastan gets stuck in the quick-
sand of one-dimensionality — both in personality 
and physique. His chiseled abs, in particular, make 
their fair share of appearances from behind that 
breastplate armor. 

The script is chock full of sayings like 
“Consider the advice of council, but always listen 
to your heart” — a bit too syrupy to forgive. Aside 
from subliminal references to the war in Iraq and 
sprinkled pejoratives describing Persians as as 
“brutal without honor” and “camel-riding illiter-

ates,” the film largely divorces itself from its titular 
culture. The entirely non-Persian cast speaks 
strictly in an Oxbridge accent — because, in case 
you never learned, ancient Persia apparently 
thought Brit-speak was classier than American 
English (or maybe that’s just director Mike 
Newell). 

Although “Prince” plays off the same tropes that 
catapulted “Pirates” to success, it never quite strikes 
the same heartstring. There are running gags and 
double entendres involving Gyllenhaal’s dagger, but 
the lack of an all-in-one character as charismatic as 
Captain Jack — combined with an overdose of deus 
ex machina — renders “Prince” little more than a 
failed mashup of the “Pirates” formula.

melodies — ensuring the band lives up 
to their namesake.

The album itself is a scrapbook of 
personal accounts, from lead singer 
Matthew Vasquez’ tale of heartbreak 
on “Bushwick Blues” — about the one 
person he just can’t seem to scrape 

from his memory — to the real-life 
revenge of Russian Vitaly Kaloyev’s for 
the death of his family on “Ballad of 
Vitaly.”

With a zippy tempo and shout-
along verses, “Bushwick” is rife with 
emotional growls and croons that gush 
freely from Vasquez’s lungs — and, 
along with them, an air of true country 
soul.

The band has packaged a winning 
combination: Heartwrenching vocals 
from an honest front-porch songbook, 
paired with aggressive acoustic guitar, 
country-tinged harmonicas and gal-
loping drums — all radiating a time-
less energy that becomes the intangible 
highlight of Below. The album finds a 
happy medium between intimate and 
larger-than-life — not without the help 
of those who know both best.

Janelle Monáe
The ArchAndroid
BLACKSMITH RECORDS

T hough soulstress Janelle Monáe conceived The ArchAndroid as a concept album about her ro-
bot alter-ego, the end product sug-
gests she is anything but. Monáe’s 
ambitious sophomore effort packs 
jazz, shoegaze, funk and soul into 
an 18-track patchwork of genres 
that no formulaic machine could 
begin to render. 

Her true alter-ego — the cha-
meleon — shows itself in the world 
of difference between “Tightrope” 
and the watery “Mushrooms & 
Roses.” The former is greased in 
Monáe’s slick vocals, spewing forth 
at a hip-hop pace and punctuated 
by thick horns and irresistible 
chants. The lo-fi latter, on the other 
hand, lays her dreamy, distorted 
voicebox over a steady drum-and-
tambourine beat in ’80s shoegaze 
style.

Monáe ventures into new ter-
ritories all the way to album closer 
“BaBopByeYa,” an old-fashioned 
jazz tune a la Lena Horne. It 
begins with a dramatic brass intro 
— all horns and snaps — before 
easing into Monáe’s now-velvety 
vocals, and a piano melody for 
good measure. She couldn’t hide 
her prowess if she tried: Her 
expertly trained voice slides up 
and down the scale, belting out 
the titular warcry with the lung 
strength of Aretha. 

Although each track has its 
own selfish flair, all are bound to-
gether by a backbone of fast-paced 
drums and smart songwriting on 
the human condition — from love 
to war to magic. She couldn’t be a 
robot if she tried.

against Central Missouri, the team that 
won the D-II title in 2000 and has 
racked up the most wins in the last 
decade in any collegiate division. 

Senior starter Matt Rossman took 
the hill, and — in what could have 
been his final performance as a Triton 
— Rossman saved his best for last. The 
UC Riverside transfer and La Verne, 
Calif. native threw a no-hitter through 
seven innings, but did not receive 
any run support. The game remained 
scoreless until the beginning of the 
eighth inning, when Bauer took first 
on a drag-bunt base hit and was moved 
to second on a sacrifice bunt. Bauman 
finally broke the deadlock by driving a 
pitch to left field that allowed Bauer to 
score to give UCSD a 1-0.

Central Missouri answered quickly 
in the bottom half of the frame by hit-
ting back-to- back doubles, breaking 
up the no-hitter and tying the score 
1-1. The game continued into extra 
innings as the Tritons left runners on 
base in the ninth and 10th innings — 
but Rossman’s pitching gem kept them 
in the game. He settled down after 
allowing the run, refusing to give up a 
hit for the rest of the game.

In the 11th, sophomore designat-
ed hitter Danny Susdorf collected his 
third hit of the game and advanced 
to third after a balk (an illegal move 
made by the pitcher that results in all 
baserunners advancing by one base) 
and a wild pitch. Lee then punched a 
single to center field, allowing Susdorf 
to score giving the Tritons a 2-1 lead. 
Rossman finished the game cleanly, 
closing out the 11th inning. Overall, 
Rossman struck out 12 and allowed 
just two hits throughout the game.

“I’m excited about going to the 
semifinals, but right now all I can talk 
about is the courageous outing that 
Matt Rossman just gave us,” head coach 
Dan O’Brien said in a statement.“That 
was his ball tonight, and he prepared 
himself for this moment all year. He 
rose to the occasion, and that’s what 
great players do.”

Rossman said he was aware he was 
pitching a no-hitter, but tried to block 
it from his mind to keep the pressure 
from getting to him.

“My mentality was the same as 
every other game: just to take it one 
pitch at a time and throw aggressively 
to a spot,” Rossman said. “I knew I had 
[a no-hitter] going the whole time. 
That was cool, but winning was obvi-
ously more important.” 

Even the game-winning batter Lee 
said most of the credit for the victory 
should go to his pitcher.

“Rossman is a true competitor, 
and there are not enough words to 
describe his performance in that game 
last night,” Lee said. “His cutter was 
his most effective pitch all night long. 
The Central Missouri lineup is a very 
powerful and dangerous offense, and 
he pitched like a true veteran and win-
ner. This really was the best I have ever 
seen him.”

Both games featured rain delays. 
During the downtime, senior reliev-
ers Dan Simmons and Eric Abraham 
kept themselves occupied by putting 
on a dance-off for those in atten-
dance. Simmons also led the team in 
a “YMCA” dance — demonstrating the 
incredible chemistry they have built 
this season.

“We feel that all of the teams here 
are as talented — or even more tal-
ented than us — and what separates 
us from the other teams is our mental 
preparedness and toughness,” Lee said. 
“We work on the mental game of base-
ball all year, and we feel like we have 
mastered it.”

UCSD, now 53-7 on the season, will 
advance to the semifinals on Thursday. 
From there, the Tritons will face 
Kutztown University, who emerged 
from the loser’s side of Bracket Two.

Central Missouri fell to 52-10 
overall with the loss. The Mules will 
face GCSU in an elimination game on 
Wednesday at 3 p.m. ET.

team captains Aubrey Panis and 
Shannon Simond during her junior-
year campaign, Cunningham said she 
felt the need to pay it forward. 

“I really appreciated the leader-
ship from the upper classmen when I 
was young,” Cunningham said. “So I 
decided I wanted to be one of the ones 
who would be very helpful for the 
young guys on the team.”

She may not have made it without 
the same sort of help. Before the 2008-
09 season began, Cunningham turned 
to McGihon for assistance. After a 
strong freshman year, her progress 
had stagnated. Although her time had 
improved slightly, she had once again 
placed fifth in the 200-meter breast-
stroke at the PCSC — and once again 
narrowly missed a trip to the national 
championships. 

Cunningham trained throughout 
the summer, strengthening her stroke 
and mental fortitude so that when she 
returned to the PCSC, she wouldn’t 
suffer the same fate for a third time.

“After my second year, we got a new 
coach — Matt Macedo,” she said. “And 
even though he was a sprint coach, he 
really helped me improve my stroke 
and that really bumped up my time. 
I made a big improvement from high 
school to my first year, but I didn’t 
make as big an improvement into my 
second year, so I sat down with Coach 
McGihon and we talked about my 
goals. Then I just had to focus to really 
improve my time after that.” 

Their efforts paid off. Cunningham 
finished third at the PCSC in 2009, 
shaving over two seconds off her time 
in the 200-meter breaststroke. And the 
improvement wasn’t limited to a single 
event: She also dropped her 100-meter 
breaststroke time by an impressive 
three seconds.

Slowly but surely, Cunningham had 
become a cornerstone of the women’s 
championship team. By her junior year, 
she began swimming additional events 
like the 200-meter butterfly and taking 
a greater leadership role — doing her 

part in the development of some of the 
younger swimmers.

With such a young team this sea-
son — including 11 freshmen and 11 
sophomores out of a total of 28 swim-
mers — a more experienced captain 
was vital for support and guidance.  
McGihon said Cunningham took an 
active learning role in her own transi-
tion from team member to captain.

“The team votes for team captain, 
and Cari really showed why she should 
be captain,” McGihon said. “She cares 
so much for everyone’s success on the 
team — that is really one of her stron-
gest attributes as a team captain. She 
stepped into her role as captain really 
quickly. She spoke with former captains 
about what to do, and she was able to 
tap into the resources of past captains 
and learned how to present herself.”

Freshman Katherine Tse said 
Cunningham was an invaluable asset 
to the newcomers. 

“Cari knows how the team works 
and was very welcoming to all the 
first-years,” Tse said. “She always has a 
positive attitude, and she loves being 
there.”

Since beginning her swimming career at age four in her home-town of San Clemente, Calif., 
Cunningham said the sport has been 
a pivotal part of her life. Her older 
brother was the first swimmer in the 
family; from there, Cunningham said 
the water was contagious.

“Since my brother started swim-
ming, I always wanted to be like him, 
and I loved being in the water,” she 
said. “I love swimming because it isn’t 
like other sports; it has an individual 
and team feel to it. You are in the 
water racing as an individual, but you 
are on a team working together.” 

Cunnignham’s passion for the sport 
only continued to grow. She began 
swimming at the club level, and carried 
her competitive resolve into a career at 
San Clemente High School, where her 
team became the league champion.

From the very beginning, 

Cunningham said she made swim-
ming a top priority.

“It was mostly about fun back 
then, but I always wanted to swim 
at the collegiate level,” she said. “It 
was always one of my goals through 
club and high school. I chose UCSD 
because I wanted to remain com-
petitive, and it was great to be able to 
swim at the next level.”

The transition from the high-
school waters to the collegiate pool 
is an uphill battle, Cunningham 
said. The training days are longer, 
the workouts are more intense and 
academics are on a whole new level. 
However, McGihon said Cunningham 
took on the challenge with ease. 

“There is a fast learning curve for 
freshman,” McGihon said. “But Cari 
caught on real quick and was a fast 
learner. I see them all grow as students 
and as swimmers, and Cari definitely 
grew fast.”

It was during her junior season 
that she really took off. Besides 
making nationals for the first time, 
Cunningham registered UCSD all-
time top-10 marks in four events 
and earned All-Conference and All-
American honors.

Cunningham said she is looking 
forward to graduation, but is unsure 
of the role swimming will take in 
her future. For now, she said plans to 
travel Europe before returning to take 
community-college classes and shoot 
for grad school.

Though her love for the sport is 
still there, Cunningham said she is 
looking forward to a break from the 
strenuous workouts and exhaustive 
practices that come with such a high 
level of competition.

“I really don’t want to train 20-plus 
hours per week anymore,” she said. 
“But I still want to be competitive and 
to see how I can train by myself. I’m 
going to miss the team and San Diego, 
but I’m excited for the future.”

HOTCORNERQUOTABLE QUIPS

The senior right-hander threw an 11-inning complete 
game for UCSD’s 2-1 win over Central Missouri on May 
24. Rossman took a no-hitter into the eighth, striking out 
12 and allowing just two hits on the night.

MATT ROSSMAN | BASEBALL“[Pitcher Matt Rossman is] a senior, he’s a veteran, he’s our team captain — but 
most importantly, he’s a flat-out winner.”

— Dan O’Brien
Head coach, baseball

W hen senior Carianne Cunningham speaks, the UCSD swim team listens.Once a timid freshman that let her stroke do the talking, Cunningham evolved into the team’s vocal leader this season. 
As team captain, she helped guide UCSD to a third-place finish at the 2010 
National Collegiate Athletic Association National Championships in March.

That’s not to downplay her performance in the pool. Cunningham 
posted a third-place finish in the 200-meter breaststroke at the 2010 Pacific 
Collegiate Swim & Dive Conference Championships on Feb. 13, and came in 
14th in the 100-meter breaststroke at nationals.  

Still, fellow senior Daniel Perdew said it’s Cunningham’s performance as 
captain that has been her crowning achievement.

“Before this year, she was more of a leader by example,” Perdew said. 
“This year, she has taken a more vocal role. She made that transition really 
well, and it’s not an easy transition to make.”

Cunningham was a natural candidate for the job. After making huge 
strides under the close tutelage of head coach Scott McGihon and former

BASEBALL — Above all else, the No. 1 
UCSD baseball team had one goal in mind 
since its season began on Feb. 1: to make 
it to the College World Series Cary, N.C. 
Finally, after a record-breaking season with 
51 wins, the Tritons are excelling in the 
Tar Heel State —taking one careful step 
at a time. 

UCSD’s first two games in the series 
were epic nailbiters — battles to the last 
pitch. Still, the Tritons pull ahead in both 
games. Behind, junior Tim Shibuya and 
senior Matt Rossman — the team’s staff 
aces — UCSD beat Georgia College & State 
University 3-2 in walk-off fashion on May 
22, then outdueled University of Central 
Missouri 2-1 in a CWS classic on May 25. 

After being delayed by rain for over 
three hours, the game against the GCSU 
Bobcats got off to a slow start. Featuring 
two of the best pitchers in the nation, it was 
clear from the start that this game would be 
decided on the mound. Both Shibuya and 
GCSU’s Martin Dewald threw complete 
games, but the UCSD ace was the last one 

standing — thanks to timely support from 
the Triton offense. 

Shibuya tossed his fifth complete game 
of the season, allowing eight hits and just 
two runs. Junior outfielder Kyle Saul drove 
in senior shortstop Vance Albitz in both 
the first and fifth innings to put UCSD up 
2-0. GCSU strung together four hits in the 
top half of the sixth to tie the game at 2-2; 
after the minor blip, however, Shibuya and 
Dewald settled to hold the teams scoreless 
until the bottom of the ninth.

Evan Kehoe led off the bottom of the 
ninth inning for the Tritons, reaching first 
after being hit by a pitch. Senior Chris 
Fung then pinch-hit for redshirt fresh-
man Danny Susdorf, laying down a perfect 
sacrifice bunt to advance Kehoe to second. 
After the Bobcats forced senior catcher 
Kellen Lee to fly out, junior second base-
man Grant Bauer singled through the left 
side, allowing Kehoe to score from second 
and seal the win. 

Bauer came up with the game-winning 
single after going hitless in his first three 
at-bats. 

“I had been struggling against [Dewald] 
in my previous at-bats, but a lot of people 
were talking to me before the at-bat and 
telling me to wait for something up and to 
stay relaxed,” Bauer said in statement. “It’s 
easy to get pretty excited in that situation, 
so I just tried to stay relaxed, and I got a 
pretty good swing on it.”  

The Tritons moved to the winner’s 
bracket after taking Game One. In Game 
One of the 2009 championships, UCSD lost 
a 3-1 decision to Dowling University before 
battling back to take third place overall in 
the double-elimination tournament.

This year, the Tritons played Game Two
