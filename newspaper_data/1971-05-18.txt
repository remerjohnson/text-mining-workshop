UCSD-Oriented Township Proposed 
John Zal/er 
Staff Writer 

Subsidized student apartments , diverse small shops and 
"speakeasies," and an interlacing system of bikeways are 
central features of a "University Community" master 
development plan released last month in draft form by the San 
Diego City Planning Department. 

The master plan envisions a " town core" less than a mile 
east of campus that is dominated economically and culturally 
by " University-related people." A mix' of residential and 
commercial uses, often in the same building, is intended to 
create a compact area of continuous and lively activity. The 
idea of a regional shopping center, on the model of Fashion 
Valley, is expressly forbidden . The plan specifies that 
commercial ventures should primarily serve the needs of the 
91 ,500 projected population of the community. . 

Within the dominant University orientation, the plan 
provides for the growth of private research corporations to 
make the area "one of the greatest academic and bio-medical 
centers in the country, if not the world ." Present location of 
the Salk Institute, Scripps Memorial Hospital , the new V A 
hospital, the UCSD Medical School will , according ot the plan, 
attract this "clean industry." 

UC Interest Foremost 

In outlining development of the approximately 9,000 acres of 
land east and north of campus, the master plan professes to 
keep University interest foremost in mind. UCSD officials are 
pleased to note that the draft does sub tantially incorporate 
nearly all of the 150 recommendations made by the University. 

This dra ft of the master plan, which was last revised in 1965, 
is the result of over two years of work by the City Planning 
Department, a large local citizens' committee, and various 
UCSD communities. The draft is expected to be adopted 
substantially as written, but it will have no real muscle. 
Rather, it is intended as the " philosophical cornnerstone" 
around which future zoning ordinances can be framed . 

There are, however, elements of a sub3tantial conflict of 
interest contained in the plan as written. The important land 
owners of the area at first wanted to build a huge regional 
hopping center. The University and the city have combined to 

block such a development, but the land owners are eager to 
begin construction and they are not necessarily interested in 
clo e cooperation with the University. Thus there is 

considerable question as to the extent to which the proposed 
community will be genuinely University-oriented. 

The ad hoc Chancellor's Advisory Committee, which has 
been primarily responsible for the University 's input to the 
plan, envisions a community that would exist almost as an 
adjunct to the UCSD campus, possibly even retaining the same 
general architectural styles. According to the plan itself, "Th.e 
residents (would ) identify themselves with the community and 
the University simultaneously. Town and niversity spirit 
would be synonomous. . ." Development of biomedical 
facilities , insofar as they complement the Medical School , 
would be welcome. 

But San Diego businessmen, organized through the Chamber 
of Commerce's " Health Sciences Development Task Force," 
as well as the large land owners , are more exclusively 
interested in attracting life sciences industry as an end in 
itself. They want a complex of educational and research 
facilities that will enchance both the economy and the prestige 
of San Diego. The " University Community" concept would not 
be entirely neglected, but it would not be primary either. 

These life science interests feel that " it is imperative that 
the best living, educational , cultural , and recreational 
facilities be provided in the community to assist life science 
facilities in attracting the best scientific personnel available." 

Student Housing Seems Incompatible 

A high percentage of low-cost, student type housing would 
not seem compatible with this goa\. It may be significant, then , 
that the niversity 's sentence specifyi ng a 15-20 per cent 
portion of student housing was modified to read simply "a 
portion." UCSD officals are hopeful of restoring the specific 
figure or an equivalent phrase. 

Further, there is reference to development of a "high 
fashion " center, another concept not compatible with a 
University atmosphere. 

These details raise the larger question that is worrying 
UCSD officials. Will the commuDity be genuinely University-
oriented, with small shops, coffee houses theaters and other 
inexpen ive diversions? Or will it develop more as a classy 
commercial area on the model of a Westwood? 

The outcome may depend on the Univer ity's ability to retain 
one other key sentence as it now is written in the plan : "The 
pace of development in the community should parallel the 
general growth of the University." Without this sentence to

Keating -
Kaufman 
Runoff Set 

Mike Palcic , AS CSD 
Presiaent , has called for a new 
presidential election betwe n 
Paul Kaufman and Karl 
Keating to take place the week 
of May 24 - 29. 

Thur day, the A CounCil in a 
vote had declared the elections 
void and ca lled for both new 
elections and runoffs. In dOlDg 
so, they as umed both 
judiciary and legislative 
powers for the Council , an 
as umption which Palcic ha 
deci.ded was illegitimate. 

The new A C D 
Constitution , adopted la t year , 
allows that judicial authority 
be vested jointly in each 
co ll ege . The judicial 
committee provided for in the 
old con titu tion and the 
elections code i nonexi tent 
and some council member felt 
that the Council wa the only 
tudent group who had th 

legitimate right to que lion the 
d cision by Palcic and Jim 
Magill to make Kaufman 
pre ident.

control the kind of runaway growth that could destroy any long-
range planning. Werner Lendemann, head of the CSD 
planning office, and George Murphy, vice-chancellor of stud nt 
affairs, fear that land own r would go ahead to exploit the 
area for short-term profits. A genuinely niversity-oriented 
community, they argue , cannot be built now for occupation 
later by UCSD people. If housing i put up, it will be occupied 
almost immediately by commuters of the larger San Diego 
area. Only by parallel growth, they feel , can the University 
influence the kind of community it wants. 

Wants Rapid Construction 

The chances for parallel development are not good. Land 
owners and life cience interests want construction to proceed 
as fast as improvement capital can be attracted. or would 
they mind if the " town core" looked more like a Westwood 
(near UCLA) than a modern Greenwich Village. 

Lendemann and Murphy tol d the TIMES that they are 
worried that the niversity may lose this control clause when 
the master plan comes up for adoptIOn by the Planning 
Commission (an appointive body separate from the Planning 
Department ). With the pha e-down of military activity in San 
Diego and the generally depressed state of the economy, the 
feeling is that no one will want to discourage the immediate 
outlay of capital , regardless of the growth rate of the 

niversity. 
The recent disclo ure that UCSD may expand only to 10,500 

students rather than the originally projected 27,500 has 
damaged the position of tho e arguing for a narrowly 

niversity-oriented community. " We had to make some 
compromises to the life science activity," 1urphy said. 

An official at the planning department added that it is 
" unrealistic" to expect a land owner to hold off development of 
his land until the University is ready. 

15,000 More Accurate 

Lendemann and Murphy tend to disagree. The 10,500 figure is 
too low, they ay , San Diego will probably grow to about 15.000. 
And , aid Murphy, "that ' a tanford and a half-certainly a big 
enough university to merit it own community development 
plan ."

Students have no direct voice 

in the decisions tha t affect the 
life and the curriculum of John 
Muir College - it is foolish to 
believe otherwise. The only 
effective position that the Muir 
College Council ca n take is one 
of a student lobby similar to the 
ASUC lobbyist in Sacramento. 
The Council's goal should be to 
exhaust all methods of contact 
and influence with the Muir 
faculty and administration in 
order to effect the meaningful 
changes so badly needed at 
Muir College , 

In addition, the Council 
should functionally serve as a 
forum for interaction bringing 
together faculty, students and 
administration in order to 
better fulfill the goals and 
programs of John Muir College 
as we define them. 

Serving on the Council for the 
past year I ha~e seen the need 
for such a basic program -
most importantly when the 
faculty instinctively reacted 
with a negative attitude to the 
proposals for curriculum 
revision put forth by the 
Council. 

Before we as students can College Council found out about

The student members of the 
Muir College Council started 
out the year with energy and 
good intentions. We tried to do 
all sorts of things but we didn't 
know how - thrash, thrash , 
thrash. We didn't get much 
done. Then slowly we started to 
learn how the school is run. We 
went to every faculty meeting 
and tried to be around 
wherever decisions were being 
made. Gradually the faculty 
and administration came to 
know us. We challenged them a 
lot but we did our homework 
and backed up our arguments. 
They listened to us. (There 
were no students in the quest 
for a new Muir Dean until the 
student members of the 

see the whole situation as we 
see it. That way, the people 
who are going to make the 
decision will have to have a 
pretty good reason before they 
vote against us. (The College 
Council failed to get the faculty 
to support our plans for 
improving the curriculum 
because we didn't do much 
lobbying before the vote. We 
presented our idea sand 
defended them well but we 
didn' t make it difficult for 
them to say no . ) 

There is very little power 
invesled in the College Council. 
We've decided almost nothing. 
The student members have 
been effective only by 
constantly struggling to get 
more student input in the 
decision - making process and 
by slowly building up contacts, 
knowledge, and experience,

anything be accomplished. 
Another objective is to gain the

population on campus, yet It 
will have at the most three 
faculty members , no 
administrators and a handful of 
secretaries, to help facilitate 
integration of learning. 

The Black Conspiracy feels 
that Muir College was designed 
originally for the white middle 
class students, and not for 
minority students. The 
minority has for years been 
forced to study the history of 
white America with little 
regard for our cultural and 
historical heritage . Thi s 
heritage hasn't been lost 
throughout the centuries, just 
misinterpreted. We believe 
that it should be richly 
available to minority students 
as well as white students. Most 
white students are ignorant to 
the facts that brought about our 
cultural background. This is 
one of the reasons there exists 
a grave communica tion 
problem among minority and 
white students now. 

The Black Conspiracy will 
not only stress a change in 
Muir College academic 
curriculum, but additional 
classes that are more relevant 
to minority and white students. 
These classes should deal with 
the problems of today and not 
yesterday: i.e. history classes. 

The Conspiracy feels that 
these classes should not be just 
restricled to Third College, but 
Muir as well. Not only do 
minority people need to know 
their history, but it's about 
time that whites wake up and 
realize that everything in t.he 
world isn't white. And if you 
don' t have, assaults on the 
elevators and race riots will 
persist continually, not only in 
white America, but in the white 
structure of John Muir College. 

If elected the conspiracy will 
not just look at itself as Black 
and minority students, but try 
and give equal weight to the 
fact that they are Muir College 
students as well, and will for 
the first time bring a new 
thought into the college and 
help bring about integration of 
thoughts and ideas. 

For those of you who have 
griped about the fact that 
minority students do not make 
the effort to communicate, 
well now you have your chance. 
All the Black Conspiracy is 
saying, what are you going to 
do with your chance?

with their professors outside of

As a part of Muir College 
Council, I would like to restate 
the purpose and objectives of 
Muir College. Certainty of our 
goal is a prerequisite to finding 
out how to reach it (whether or 
not to have graduation 
requirements, etc.). 

We also need a firm er 
orientation for both incoming 
and current students. This can 
only come about with a clear 
statement of objectives. 

I would like to further 
develop the Conte mporary 
Issues Department. It has a lot 
of potential for th e 
actualization of student ideas 
by the students who crea le 
them.

Dan Spellens 
"A recall doesn't give the student a choice. A new election is 

needed because I have noticed a lot of concern among many 
members of the Student Body. Concerning the constitutionality of 
the AS Council move, the constitution states that there be a 
judicial branch of the AS,that has power to question the aels of the 
executive powers of the AS Council. 

"Because no such judicial branch exists, because there was a 
concern among many members of the Student Body, because the 
AS Council is the only group of students that the Student Body has 
voted to represent them, and because Article II, Section I, 
Paragraph 8 of the ASUCSD Constitution says that 'the ASUCSD 
Council shall have the power to assume such additional authority 
as may be necessary for the welfare and efficiency of the 
ASUCSD' then it follows that the recent AS assumption of judicial 
powers was logical. 

"Those are my only reasons for the actions that I took. I did not 
do this because I felt that Paul Kaufman would not be a competent 
president; I feel he has a good working knowledge of the AS, I felt, 
and still feel , that my move best represented the concerns of the 
student body."

" I am not adverse to having new elections_ as I've stated many 

times before. I am adverse, however, to the actions of Thursday 's 
AS Council when they voted to usurp judicial powers, thus making 
them an executive, as well as judicial branch, and that 's why I 
called their actions a 'parliamentary orgasm.' I'm also concerned 
that people, without any basis in fact, have accused me of illegal 
maneuvering in this election, and it's ironic that my accusers are 
actually the people manipulating the situation for political 
advantages ,

'Keating's Kommandos ' came even close to being elected by their 
very own silent majority. The actions of the council last Thursday 
was merely an unconstitutional parliamentary mainipulation by 
an illegitimately constituted body so tha t Karl could run again and 
put forth his 'issues' - be they Free Silver or whatever.

" I confess. The truth is out. Were it not fo r the brilliant 

investigative efforts of Karl Kea ting and Jim Sills in protecti'ng 
the students' interests, my conspiracy would have succeeded, 
Yes. as early as last fall's Hot Tuna Concert and thereafter there 
were meetings in dark alleys and under bleachers in the gym. We 
plotted the fronting of David Shaw, his election, his resignation, 
and all for the purpose of Paul Kaufman to continue the divine 
dynasty of Heavy. Now discovered, I slip into retirement with a 
cloudy blight over my head- foiled in my attempt to fool the 
amazing analytical minds at UCSD ." 

Karl Keating 
"The decision to have a runoff election between Paul Kaufman 

and me is inherently unfair to both the remaining primary 
candidates and the electorate. The new elections ought to have as 
candidates the five individuals who ran in the primaries. Since the 
AS Council called for a new sequence of elections, the council 
ought to be heeded. I trust that those students unhappy with the 
machinations of the current AS government will vote in the 
election and that they will choose to end the longlasting dynasty 
that has omnipotently ruled from Building 250."

Township Proposed • • • 
,Continued from page 1) 

A UCSD planners would have it, the township will contain a 
full range of housing . UCSD estimates that about half of the 
population will be directly related to the Universi ty. 

Federal subsidies are anticipated if student apartments are 
to be kept in the $50 to $75 range. The plan specifically notes 
that "housing currently being proposed by private developers 
will be too expensive ... Existing costs with respect to labors, 
material , land and financing make it difficult to meet the 
housing market within the area. Innovative construction 
techniques must be encol)raged along with subsidies and 
incentives · from governmental agencies." 

Murphy IS pleased with the University 's influence on the 
development so far. "We haven 't been merely reacting to other 
proposals," he said, "but we have formulated our own policies 
on what we think is ideal , and then worked toward it. "

AS Elections 
The questions which have been 

raised by Dave Shaw's "mysterious" 
concession makes it necessary for us 
to make several comments on the. first 
partof this year's AS elections. 

First of all we support the Council 
decision to hold new elections, because 
.we gauge this is what the majority of 
stlldents (at least among those who 
care about AS affairs) desire. 
However, we stand behind new 
elections only because a quirk in our 
election procedures allowed a voting 
minority of 391 (ShaW's primary vote) 
to essentially put Paul Kaufman 
temporarily into office . And this is the 
most important consideration-it was 
391 STU DE NTS, not any AS dynasty, 
which made a "loser a winner." 

Therefore we stand even more 
strongly opposed to those on campus 
(led by AS presidential candidate Karl 
Keating) who are attempting to 
make a "moral-ethical" issue out of 
the new elections. These students have 
attempted to conjure up an image of 
conspiracy, dynasty and backroom 
politics between Paul Kaufman and 
Dave Shaw. The idea of conspiracy 
and shady dealings, we feel , is more 
indicative of the never-never land in 
which our campus right-wingers seem 
to live, rather than the facts. 

First, although it was a surprise, 
there was nothing really 
"mysterious" about Shaw's 
concession . His campaign was based 
on the idea that AS was irrelevant to 
real student concerns. As he himself 
stated, those students who truly 
supported his campaign were neither 
surprised nor disappointed by his 
concession. In fact, if anything, Dave 
Shaw is to be commended for the 

triton 

consistency between his philosophy 
and his actions. 

Second, Shaw conceded to Kaufman 
not because he supported him or 
thought him the best candidate, but 
because he was by definition the only 
other run-off candidate . Bel ieving the 
AS irrelevant, Shaw could are less who 
is the new AS president. 

The motive behind the charges of 
conspiracy is not hard to surmise. 
Both Keating and his defunct 
philosophy were decisively rejected 
by students in the first AS primary. A 
new election makes a new "issue" an 
obvious necessity . II's not surprising 
that the great majority of complaints 
against Shaw's actions are coming 
from Keating supporters who feel that 
Shaw cheated them. 

It should be clearly understood that 
Dave Shdw was never the 
"conservative" candidate . His 
campaign was not based on being 
against such issues as the present 
administration and salaries. 

As stated before, he felt the entire 
institution irrelevant. When Keating 
decided to su'pport Shaw he put 
himself in favor of putt ing cemeteries 
on campus (which we must admit 
makes more sense than Keat ing's 
own campaign) and whatever else the 
Shaw platform might consist of . Shaw 
cheated no one, as his campaign was 
an honest one, and his concession 
consistent with it. 

Its tru Iy ironic that Keating and 
supportgrs, who are denouncing the 
lack of "morals and ethics" in the first 
election, have made public a stated 
goal to "hang you (Kaufman) by your 
ass" in the new elections.

OPINION 

A New Form of 
Student Government 

Diddo Clark 
The students of UCSD have clearly voted against the AS as it 

is now constituted. The results of the election show that most 
students don' t relate to the AS and don't see that it does them a 
whole lot of good. 

People seem to be taking the college elections a little more 
seriously. More people are running, they are closer to home, 
and we're more likely to know some of them 

The Third College Board of Directors, Muir College Council, 
and Revelle Committee on College Affairs represent a wider 
range of students than the AS has. This past year, seven of the 
elected AS officers were Revelle students, one was from Muir, 
and none were from Third College. 0 wonder they couldn't 
represent us adeQuatelv! 

The Associated Students hasn't worked. We need sometbing 
to fight for student interests, so why not try an association of 
college governments? We could emphasize the small 
community of each different campus rather than the Berkeley-
style mass of a distant AS. 

The student representatives of the three colleges could get 
together, determine how student interests could best be 
served , divide up the responsibility, and go to it. They'd 
probably want to select one or two people to help co-ordinate 
all the activities. They may want to make some services 
independent and apolitical (such as the Campus Programing 
Board which needs members who are into entertainment 
rather than skilled in student politics ). 

The central student group should constantly seek to 
articulate student needs and be fluid enough to tackle them as 
they arise. There may be oroblems that don ' t fit into the 
categories set up by the commission system. Let's not limit 
ourselves to categories. 

MD Rap 

Not Salmon ., But T u rtles 
V. Robert Allen, M.D. 

Dr . Allen : 

Wbat is salmonella (if tbat 's 
how you spell it) - and what 
are the problems of tbe disease 
both on a personal and 
epidemic level? 

Thank you , 

Steve 

Dear Steve : 

Sa lmonella is the generic 
name for a large group of 
bacteria which may cause 
gastroenteritis . Since Salmon 
and Smith isolated the first of 
these bacilli in 1885. more than 
1.200 different variations have 
been identified. The Big Daddy 
of the genus is Salmonella 
typbosa, which causes typhoid 
fever . a very severe intestinal 
infection accompanied by rash. 
bloody diarrhea. and an 
enlarged spleen. Typhoid fever 
is relatively rare . thank 
goodness . But infectIOns 
caused by any of the numerous 
other Salmonella species are 
not unusual. 

Most sa lmonella infections 
are characterized by sharp 
abdominal pain and diarrhea . 
accompanied by moderate 
fever and lIau ea . The feeling . 
which can only be described as 
lousv. lasts 2 to 5 davs. after 
which you get well . . 

People co ntra ct 
almonellosis mo t often by 

ea ting contaminat d food of 
almost anv ort. but it i also 
possible to get the di ea e from 
ontact with p t or live tock 

whi h harbor th g rm in 
their dig tive tract without 
themselves b coming ick. 

Among the many animals 
which can carry sa lmonella 
and transmit It to humans are 
dogs . cats. rat . parakeets. 

pig s, and cows . Small 
epidem ics have broken out in 
the spring from salmonella 
carried by baby chicks and 
ducklings sold as Easter pets . 

In recent years. a new culprit 
has been discovered in a 
seemingly most innocuous pet, 
those baby . turtles sold so 
widely in dime stores and pet 
shops. Technically these little 
turtles are Cumberland 
terrapins, a fresh -water 
speCies that may pick up the 
germ in contaminated water 
and carry it for a long lime. 
Infected turtles have been 
turning up in San Diego. 

Salmonellosis is usually a 
miserable. but short-lived, 
illness confined to the 
intestinal tract. but in a few 
cases. the organism enters the 
blood stream and produces 
more sever di sease. Persons 
with sickle-cell ' anemia are 
especially susceptible to this 
blood stream invasion by 
salmonella . 

Specific diagno sis of 
salmonello is is not ea y. as 
the organi m would have to be 
cultured from the stools and is 
readily mi sed. Probably a lot 
of ca es go by unspecifically 
diagno ed. Certain antibiotics 
are sometimes used to treat 
the salmonella gastro nteritis. 
but they don't appreciably 
shorten the duration of the 
illness and many salmonella 
strains are highly resistant. 
Following recovery. a person 
may continuc to carry the 
organism and shed it in his 
stool for up to 3 months. 

The moral of this whole story 
I : Wa h your hand a lot. 
e p cla lly if you have ppts.

Brian Ritter and Mark 
Siegel's "platform" is the most 
revolting thing I've seen 
printed in a long time. 

It is simply projecting male

common as the dogs we see in 
the vacant lot. Our .bodies are

Brian is recommending only 
one commandment- Love, and 
there are nine others. H yoo 
break the ten, they will break 
you and that 's what has 
happened to Brian's campaign. 

Brian is doing a lot of sloppy 
thinking. I would hope our 
students want something more 
in a leader than that, and they 
have shown that they do! He 
has dug down into the mire for 
a 'brilliant' new idea, but he 
hasn 't found the peart , only a 
handful of the tinking mire. 

Brian is showin g hiS 
ignorance in the humanities 
and what he says is barbaric. 
He is by-passing the great 
issues, the current problems, 
the social problems of the day. 
Th ere is work to be

Free Choice 
Editor: 

Until now I had been under 
the impression that those 
running for student 
government were idealists, not 
callous politicians that one 
must put up with outside of the 
campus. David Shaw's recent 
concession to Paul Kaufman 
nol only deprives the students 
of their right to free choice, but 
it is so out of place with fair 
political procedures, that one 
cannot but help wonder about 
the motives of the candidates 
in question. 

This is especially true when 
one considers the four-day 
interval between the 
announcement of the results of 
the election and Shaw 's 
concession. What happened 
during those mysterious 
missing hours? Did Shaw not 
say that "Paul Kaufman really 
wants to be prom queen?" 
Then why did he concede in 

favor of the "queen? " 
Unless a satisfactory 

explanation is forthcoming , 
and forthcoming damn fast , 
one must only assume that 
cynical political maneuvering 
has indeed found its way onto 
the campus. 

H Mayor Curran is out of a 
job in si" months, he will know 
where to come. 

Bob DeLeonardis 

Never Again 
Editor: 

I am disgusted with the 
smoke-filled-room politics that 
have dominated the selection of 
an AS president. Through what 
sneaky method did Mike Palcic 
appoint Paul Kaufman 
president? (That's right -
Palcic even admitted that, in 
effect. he was appointing 
Kaufman because no one said 
he couldn '!. ) 

I think this is unfair. I agree 
with Arthur Olson: Palcic has 
been playing dirty for a long 
lime. Mr. Ol son noted recently 
tha t Paicic had been handing 
out free food to s tudents so that 
the students would vote in 
favor of the EOP fees. And the 
food was bought with AS 
money! 

Whether someone was for or 
against the fee or for or 
against Kaufman is irrelevant.

I think we ought to have a

we ought to insist that Palcic

I am white and I believe in

a unified group of Blacks who 
can give Muir the change it 
desperately needs. Unlike the 
present council, I believe the 
Conspiracy is not afraid of 
Provost Stewart or even other

Tactile Art at Balboa Park 
Carri, Rick.y 
Arts Wriler 

. Many ~~p!e, particularly artists, have j~ined the lamenting 
In concern WIth the fact that too much emphasis has been put 
on the senses of sight and hearing in modern society. This 
stress on the eyes and ears has subordinated the other senses 
and since 98% of our bodies is covered with skin, many peopl~ 
feel a disproportionate emphasis is on the sense of sight, rather 
than touch. 

Unfort~nately, many ~Ie are faced with the loss of sight 
and hearing and there IS httle they can do in their leisure time 
since most institutionalized recreation is based on the 
assumption that the consumers can see and hear. During the 
1960's a nature revival took place and " blind walks" (where the 
hikers were blindfolded and learned the advantages to feeling 
things rather than just looking at them) sensitized certain 
people to the point where they could empathize with those who 
had no sight. 

Although many art courses (primarily sculpture ) have been 
taught to the blind for many years, recently artists have 
expressed a trend in "tactile" sculpture-sculpture designed 
primarily for the blind so they could have the additional 
experience in "feeling" art. 

The California Arts Commission was aware of this need for 
enculturation of those who could not see, and 15 California 

museu~s have donated highly textural sculptures ranging 
from circa 500 B.C. to the present for an exhibition entitled 
"Perception : An E~hibition of Sculpture for the Sighted and 

B~ind ." This exhibit will have its inaugural showing in San 
D!ego at the Baroque Gallery of the Fine Arts Gallery of San 
DIego (Balboa Park) before it travels on to other California 
cities. 

The California Arts Commission should be highly 
commended for its interest in this quarter, and they announced 
that this San Diego premiere showing will be held from May 21 
through June 20. 
The theme of the showing is man's changing image of 

himself over the period of the last 2500 years. For the sighted 
as well as the blind gallery-goer the added dimension of 
feeling a sculpture is well worth a visit to the gallery. The 
historical pers~ctive that can be gained (the exhibit is in 
chronological order ) from the exhibit is invaluable, because 
the way man projected himself to others is important to be 
able to historically evaluate man and his environment. The 
nuances in texture throughout the art periods presented 
provides interesting historical perspective . 

There will be provisions made for. transportation from 
~nu:al communities in the San Diego area for blind people 
WIshIng to feel the show. Those desiring rides for the blind are 
asked to please call members of the Delta Gamma Alumnae 
association between 10 a.m. and I p.m. on weekdays at 298-
4219.

Concert Happenings 

Open Your Ears W-i-d-e! 
Terry Borak 
Arts Editor 

OutgOing AS Program Board 
Chairman Dan Spellens, de-
spite a "you won 't have 
Spellens to kick around any-
more" farewell to the press, 
has gotten together the last 
concert of his term for this 
weekend . Saturday night, 
Brewer and, Shipley will be 
performing in the gym at 8:30, 
with tickets reasonably priced 
at $1 for under-grads, $2 for 
grads, faculty and staff, and $3 
for the general public. On the 
bill with Brewer and Shipley 
are Roy Raisin, Danny's 
mellow country-rock discovery 
who got a standing ovation at 
the recent John Sebastian 
concert. 

Brewer and Shipley are well 
known for their popular songs 
heard on both AM and FM rock 
stations , which include : 
"Tarkio Road ," "Witchi·tai· 

., 
/(J(J(, »/U,. 

.s4,£6~ 
~S~P/~ 
7fm"o 

to," and "One Toke Over the 
Line." Their melodic country-
folk vocal harmonies will be 
accompanied by pleasant 
acoustic guitar-work . 

Don' t let this AS sponsored 
concert go down the tubes 
financially . It's going to be a 
good show, and it'll be a better 
one if there is a packed gym to 
enjoy it. Good vibes at a rock 
concert are infectious; it is one 
of the few types of events 
where crowds only add to the 
fun . 

One more note about musical 
events on campus: John 
Fahey, atonal and futuro-
classical guitarist, will be 
playing in a FREE noon 
concert today, on the Grassy 
Knoll behind the Humanities 
Library. Bring your lunch and 
your friends , for some 
exceptional guitar playing, by 
the inimitable John Fahey 
(also being sponsored by the AS 
and Campus Program Boards).
