Regent, Student Panel for New Regent Selection? 
from LA nm.. by penn ...... 

A group of conservative 
University of California regents is 
stag ing a quiet move to 
significantly lessen-- if not 
eliminate-the influence of UC 
students in the selection of a 
student regent. 

If successful, the net reult may 
well be that student leader~ho 
have fought long and hard for the 
appointment of a student regent--
will boycott the selection 
process . 

At a meeting of the Regents 

Committee on Reorganization in 
San Francisco, a recommendation 
is expected to be made that 
candidates for student regent be 
screened by a panel made up of 
five regents and four students . 
The panel's recommendation 
would then be sent to the full 
board for approval. 

If adopted, this would give 
regents control over the selection 
process from beginning to end. 
This is vastly different from any 
selection process-all of which 
gave students more of a voice-

ever seriously dicussed in public 
by regents . 

The move has caught students, 
as well as many regents and 
university officials, by surprise. 
And it appears likely that the 
proposal will touch off a fight 
pitting conservative regents who 
are behind the move against 
students and liberal regents at 
Wednesday's committee meeting 
and at a meeting of the full board 
Friday.

Coop OKs BRG Allocations; 
Opposes Town Center Plan 

by Rich Yep 

The Student Cooperative 
Monday approved S18,OOO worth 
of student fee allocations to 
campus organizations, and voted 
to end a statement to the San 
Diego City Council expressing the 
Coop's rejection of the University 
Town e Center concept . 

Budget Resource Group (BRG) 
member Brian O ' ioughl in 
presented the budget proposal, 
whic h saw relatively light 
haggling among members. The 
BRG is the subcommittee of the 
Coop that recommends budget 
allocat ions. 

Because of recent changes in 
the committee, the BRC had only 
two weeks to compile the winter 
budget, mentioned O ' ioughlin .

committee and a leader in the 
move for a student regent, said he 
knew nothing of the proposal 
until he received the committee 
meeting agenda late last week. 
He said he would oppose it. 

Exactly wh ich conservative 
regents on the 10-member 
committee are pushing the 
proposal is not certain . 

One liberal regent, Frederick G. 

authorize a selection procedurt' 
which , by all indications, would 
be agreeable to students and 
most regents . 

Under that procedure, two 
panels--com posed of students 
from UC campuses in Nothern 
and Southern Cal ifornia-would 
select from a total of three 
students as candidates for the 
board seat . From these, the 

R 'egents Highlights 
Meeting this afternoon, the Special Committee on 

Reorganization is expected to recommend that the board seat a 
student Regent. Controversy is presently brewing over the selection 
process for the new member [see story, this page 1: 

The committee on Grounds and Buildings will consider 
proposed plans for a Clinical Teaching facility, which would be built 
adjacent to UCSD's Basic Science Building. Approval both by the 
committee and the board is expected; 

.•. and, various regental committee and the full board will con-
sider several appointments of UCSD faculty , including a major 
position in the history department. 

Dutton, said the move is clearly 
an example of "manipulation by 
older regents ." 

DeWitt A. Higgs, a moderate-
to-conservative regent who is 
chairman of the committee, 
declined comment on the issue. 

Larry Miles , undergraduate 
student body president at UCLA 
and chairman of the univer-
sitywide Student Body Presidents 
Council, said his group, which has 
led the campaign for a student 
regent, voted Friday to "com-
pletely reject" the proposal . If 
approved by the regents, he said, 
"there will be no student regent." 

Th e regents reorgan i zat ion 
committee for the last two 
months has been considering two 
issues: whether to add a student 
to the board (as authorized by 
California voters last November) 
and, if so, what procedure should 
be used to select that student. 

Until a few days ago sources 
close to the committee felt it was 
a virtual certainty that the 
committee would vote to add a 
student to the board-and would 

regents would select the student 
regent. 

Many sources still feel that In 
the end it is this proposal that will 
be adopted by the full board . 

However , about midweek 
rumors began to spread that the 
committee, or at least some of Its 
conservative members, secretly 
had decided to push for a new 
procedure. 

The rumors were confirmed 
Thursday when agenda materials 
were received by the regents 
Included were two proposals for 
the selection of a student regent 
One called for the student panel 
screening process. The other 
recommended the regent -

Cafeteria Safe ,Robbed; 
Inside Job Said Possible 

Campus cafeterias have always had problems with people ripping off 
food. But now, people are ripping off money. 

Eighty-seven dollars were taken from a floor safe in the Muir 
Cafeteria sometime the evening of February 4, according to UC San 
Diego police Detective Manuel Morales, who is investigating the case. 

Morales says the police had rio leads as of Monday. They are 
questioning those who were around the cafeteria that night, including 
employes. 

An inside job is possible, admitted Morales, since the floor safe had 
no markings on it and appeared not to have been broken into. 

This is the first time one of the cafeterias has been buglarized, said 
Morales. 

Muir cafeteria manager Willie Mitchell , in whose office ~ ... !' safe is 
kept , declined comment on the matter but referred Triton Times 
questions to the University Police.

Revell Not Stagnant,' But Evolving 
I n response tc the article by the 

Student Committee For 
Evaluation of Revelle 
Requirements: 

Your complaint is one of 
stagnation in the Revelle 
requirements ; actually, the 
situation is quite the contrary. 
The curricula is thought abOut 
and evaluated continually . 
Suggestions often arise, are 
disc4ssed, and acted upon . Every 
program (Natural Science, 
Humanities, Social Science, etc.) 
is re-evaluated after each quarter, 
and crit ically assessed before the 
class is again presented . I per-
sonally know of the extensive 
revisions, deletions, additions, 
and modifications that have been 
instituted in the Natural Science 
sequence. The effort and thought 
that goes into such changes 
would probably astound you . The 
results are courses that are 
current , reflective of fresh 
concepts and outlooks, 
Imaginative, inventive, 
responsive and demonstrative of 
new modes of thought. 

There is no stagnation in the 
courses themselves. Change, and 
change for the better, is con-
tinual. That there has not been a 
drastic revision of the overall 
requirements is not a valid 
criticism . Unnecessary change is 
not healthy The idea of giv ing 
everyone a well-rounded, inter-
related and diversified education 

is a fine concept. The curricula is 
basically an excellent one. It does 
not, in my opinion, net"d to be 
changed unless it can be 
deUlOnstrated that there is 
something wrong with it, or that a 
chan ge to another spec i fie 
program would be beneficial 

. Change for change's sake is 
absurd; and for you to merely say 
that there is some trouble with 
the program , without offering 
constructive suggestions, is not 
helping the situation . It is up to 
you to offer alternatives and 
replacements which are superior 
to the Revelle requirements- and 
to show their superiority. You will 
be surprised how responsive the 
Provost's office is to new ideas . I 
have seriously talked to Paul 
Saltman and Murray Goodman 
about such matters when they 
were Provost, and found a 
willingness to listen , sensitivity, 
initiative and a strong desire for 
constructive progress. 

The general tone of your article 
is that you are dissatisfied with 
the abi lity of the Revelle 
requirements to produce 
" Renaissance " people . There 
never was any guarantee that the 
curricula would accomplish this , 
The. individual is only offered the 
opportun ity to take advantage of 
the diversity and depth of the 
curri cula , It IS up to th individual 

to advance , to integrate 
knowledge, to learn from the 
inter -relations and the con-
necttons of varied disciplines, 
This requires that the student be 
motivated enough to absorb, 
analyze and reflect on the course 
presentations; that he or she can 
integrate the diversified 
knowledge into their personality 
In this way, the individual will be 
able to view their life and the 
universe as a truly whole person-
as a i{enaissance preson. 

I agree that more could be 
done to implement this result . I 
think that more inteHlisciplinary 
courses should be offered; even 
required, which would expose the 
students to those that have in-
tegrated several fields of 
knowledge, and the methods by 
which they have accomplished it . 
While the present courses offer 
great depth in their fields, little is 
presently done to mold these 
separate branches of knowledge 
into a single, unified outlook . I 
think this is regrettable. But the 
only way that the situation can be 
changed is to suggest positive, 
const ru cti ve changes; and not to 
complain about the lack of 
change , 

ROBERT CALDWELL 

Students Have Power, Should Use It 
One hears a good deal of 

diversity in opinion concern ing 
the role of student government, 
and more generally, the role of 
the student in the administrative 
process of the University . If one 
talks with people acquainted with 
the larger UC's, most notably 
UCLA, the overriding sentiments 
range from a feeling of 
decadence (due, no doubt, to 
that President's sa lary, expense 
account, office, and secretary), to 
a feeling of envy ("That assholel 
Sure is gonna help him out when 
he appl ies to grad schooL") As far 
as the role of student govern-
ments, opinions range from 
allocator of funds to pawn of the 
administration . 

When one considers the role of 
students in the administrative 
process, views tend to become a 
little more c learly defined, 
Adm in i st rators give students 
enough mud to get dirty in, but 
when th ey get too rambunctious, 
the "older and wiser" must pull 
them out, wash them off, and 
probably add a slap on the hand, 
Students, on the other hand, say 
"Right on

'
" and then mutter 

someth ing under their breath 
when asked what the hell is so 
right on about the whole idea , 

Well , I have considered this 
question at length, and am now 
going to attempt to describe my 

sentiments as to why the hell you 
should have an effective , 
legitimate voice in the working of 
this, or any other institution of 
higher learning. rirst and 
foremost, STUDENTS HAVE THE 
POWER The only other group on 
campus with near the amount of 
power that the student body has 
is the administration , But having 
the abi lity alone doesn't Justify 
using it . The second reason is that 
NO ONE IS GOING TO IM-
PLEMENT THE CHANGES THE 
STUDENTS WANT IF THE 
STUDENTS DON 'T DO IT 
THEMSELVES . 

You can't expect the ad-
ministration to really implement 
th changes you want, for a 
number of rea ons, One is the age 
of the average administrator . 
Usually an enti re generation 
separates his ideas from your 
own , Second is the fact the 
administration works many years 
in advance, wh ich tends to make 
their views more rigid, not 
wanting to deviate from their 
strategy. Thirdly, they think the 
system is relatively effective aod 
will continue to be so with 
periodic modifi ca tion s. Now 
don't get me wrong; the ad-
ministration is trying to do a good 
job, They just don't have a 
complete co mprehension of 
student views.

However, the real reason for 
student participation is real iy a 
question of consciousness , 
Everyone who goes to UCSD has 
been fucked over at least once. 
Even the little things, like the fact 
that eating in the cafeteria your 
freshman year continually gave 
you diarrhea, or that a professor 
won't Ii ten to you. Everyone of 
us has had a deaf ear turned to 
one of our gripes . At least once or 
twice some of you have sat 
around smoking dope or sipping a 
beer and just bitched about what 
a place this is , And yet no one has 
thought of chan gi ng the way 
things are. Let me inform you all, 
this is not the inevitable nd to 
your education . It doesn't have to 
be this way. A well known ad-
ministrator has said, "With ten 
organized students you can do 
anything." That is nothing but the 
truth . Because of this truth , there 
is more than enough reason to 
use the government, colleges, 
classes, organizations, and in 
general anything you can get your 
hands on in order to make the 
University more relevant to the 
people it serves.. ,the students , 

Th e roots of the word 
bureaucracy shows that it s 
meaning is " to erve."

In the time it takes to drive 
your friend home, you could save 
his life. 

If your friend's been drinking 
too much, he shouldn't be driving. 

The automobile crash is the 
number one cause of death of people 
your age. And the ironic thing is 
that the drunk drivers resp~msible 

for killing young people are most 
often other young people. 

Ta~e ten minutes. Or twenty. 
Or an hour. Drive your friend 
home. That's all. If you can't do 
that, call a cab. Or let him sleep 
on your couch. 

We're not asking you to be 
a doctor or a cop. Just a friend.

&rbpra Chancellor Vernon 
I. Cheadle. 

A new comprehensive out-
patient program for the treatment 
of arthritis is underway at UC San 
Diego's University Hospital. 

The San Diego proiect is one of 
seven in the state sponsored by 
the California Regional Medical 
Program under federal legislation 
which appropriated S4.5 million 
for planning and development of 
arthritis centers throughout the 
country. 

Dr . F. Richard Convery, 
director of rehabilitation at the 
hospital and an associate 
professor of surgery at the School 
of Medicine was the grant 
recipient and heads the local 
S45,783 one-year program. 

He has assembled a staff which 
includes occupational and 
physical therapists, social and 
vocational workers, nurses and 
physicians, all working as a team 

. to establish a program of patient 
evaluation, treatment and home 
follow-up for arthritic patients in 
San Diego 

Mercy Program 
In addition to implementing 

the pilot program at University 
Hospital , the RMP project 
members also began providing 
services this month to clinic 
outpatients at Mercy Hospital. 

As one aspect of the project, 
problems relating to society, 
employment, self- images and 
sexual adjustments will be shared 
by six arthritis patients, all 
women , during weekly group 
meetings which began Jan . 31 at 
University Hospital under the 
leadership of social worker Mart i 
Kopp . The women have a 
commonality in that all are in 
their late 20s and early 30s, five of 
the six are married, and each has 

some disfigurement of hands or 
legs. Other weekly groups will 
follow. 

In another aspect , a vocational 
counselor is developing a 
"cottage industry" approach to 
employment for the home bound 
arthritis patient. And according to 
counselor Mike McCraw, the 
large San Diego firms he has 
contacted are enthusiastic .

Li Mandri explained that a 
proiect like the Towne center 
must be approved by 1) the 
Planning Dept . of San Diego, 2) 
the Planning Commission , and 
finally 3) the San Diego City 
Council . 

Ronnie 'Hahn, son of developer 
Ernest Hahn, discussed at length 
the ideas of why his father's 
company felt the need to build a 
center. 

Hahn explained that the 
original plan of 3 million square 
feet was withdrawn by his 
company before it reached the 
San Diego City Council because 
his company thought the plan 
was too big. 

Claiming the new plan of 1.1 
million squre feet was, in 
comparison , smaller than the 
Veteran 's and Scripps hospitals. 
Hahn said, " Bearing in m ind the 
need of the University Town plan, 
we're not out to profit from it, but 
are acting on the Master Plan ." A 
motion that the Coop oppose the 
Center was passed by more than 
the two-thirds required .

believable," Miles said . 
Up until Thursday, Miles' 

biggest probl em was trying to 
hold together a compromi se 
between studen ts and regents 
over the issue. 

The compromise was the 
proposal for two student panel s 
to submit a li st of three can-
didates to regents, who would 
make their fi nal selection from 
that list . 

Originally, the students wanted 
sole responsibility for se lect ion of 
a tud nt regent. But when 
stud ent leaders en count red 
some regental opposition to that , 
they fell back to the compromise 
plan , wh ich appeared to have 
regental support . 

Then came word of the new 
proposal to give regents tota l 
contro l over th e se lect ion 
process. Student leaders voted to 
reiect that proposal and for a time 
seemed angry enough to forget 
the whole thing. In the end, 
though, they agreed to continue 
supporting th e compromise plan .

Last Sunday, playing in the 
aftermath of Saturday's rainstorm, 
the men's fi rst rugby team 
defeated the Pasadena rugby 
club, 26-8. 

The men got off to a slow start 
as they were only able to manage 
a 4-4 halftime score. They got 
untracked in the second half, 
outscoring their opponents 22-4; 
and l imiting Pasadena to a single 
try. 

The women's team continued 
in thei r winning ways with a 
sparkl ing 40-0 wh itewash of the 
Pasadena Eleanor rugby team. 
Their victory was the prefect

women's squad was speedster Jill 
Taylor who scored four tr ies

Gabor Szabo / Chuck Mangione 

Black Music Voiced 
The life and achievements of black abolitionist Fred_rick Douglass 

will be commemorated in a concert presented by the UCSD Gospel 
Choir on Sunday, February 16, at 8 :30 in the Revelle Cafeteria . 

According to director Cecil Lytle, the chief concern of the choir is 
the preservation of legitimate forms of black music in America today. 
Religious music is one such form, with traditional roots going back to 
the establishment of the first African Methodist Episcopal Church by 
Richard Allen in 1974. The form of worship and liturgy developed in 
this church allowed greater freedom of emotional expression, body 
movement and participation than that exhibited by European Pro-
testant denominations. 

Black religious music has always been closely connected to in-
dependent black denominations, and its development is directly 
linked to a community which has gone through slavery, eman-
cipation, two world wars and other holocausts, as well as the 
development of o~her musical moods expressed in jazz and the blues 
of Bessie Smith . 

While the Gospel Choir attempts to preserve the traditional forms 
of music, it also ventures into more secular adaptations. Their chief 
concern is music which speaks to the human condition, socially, 
pol itically, and spiritually. 

Singers in the choir represent the San Diego community as well as 
UCSD. Reverend Pacely of Phillips Temple, C.M.E. in southeast San 
Diego, and Professor Charles Lamb of Urban and Rural Studies will 
each speak at the concert . 

The concert is free and open to the public.

Despite the pre-concert down-
pour of rain as I stood outside of 
the gym last Sunday night, 
waiting for the doors to open for 
the Szabo-Mangione concert, my 
spirit was not dampened by the. 
time I got inside and had settled 
my wet body down for an evening 
of jazz. The UCSD gym was 
packed with what seemed like a 
warm, receptive crowd, everyone 
was glad to be in out of the rain ; 
thE' night looked promising. 

No one, however, quite ex-
pected the brilliance and quality 
that accompanied the Chuck 
Mangione Quartet. Mangione is 
not a big name around these parts 
yet, but with performances like 
the one Sunday night, he hasn't 
far to go before he will be a top 
billing himself. 

The most popular of 
Mangione's works are those he 
has recorded with the Rochester 
Philharmonic Orchestra, but the 
fact that he can make these same 
pieces sound smooth , syn-
cronized, and very tight with only 
three other musicians backing 
him up, impresses me that this 
man is a genius in his own right. 

The quartet began the show 
with a tune entitled "Legend of a 
One-Eyed Sailor," a beautiful 
interlacing of Mangione on 
flugehorn and Gerry Niewood on 
soprano sax . The number set thE'

audience afire with delight; 
Mangione's talented, vibrant 
quartet with Joe La Barbara on 
drums, Chip Jackson on bass, 
Niewood on "everything" (as 
Mangione put it), all blended 
with his own masterful technique 
on flugelhorn, were a pleasant 
and welcome surprise, prodUCing 
that foot tapping, thigh bumping 
feeling that makes a jazz en-
semble so good. 

The rest of Mangione's set 
provided a clean, pure array of 
sound. Off of his new album (to 
be released in March). the 
Quartet played "Can't We Do This 
All Night ," a tune that proved 
Niewood's many talents on a 
number of brilliant solo runs; 
followed by a very quiet, very 
melodic flute piece simply called 
"Soft ." 

Note should be made of bassist 
Jackson who skillfully managed a 
long solo number with grace and 
perfected style, and of drummer 
LaBarbara, whose talent for 
keeping the group together with a 
powerful beat was displayed with 
ease. 

The set ended with " Land of 
Make Believe," nominated this 
year for two grammies, and a 
clear indication of the dynamic, 
innovative quality that the 
Mangione Quartet enfolds . Their 
ability to weave instrumental 
sound into a tapestry of exquisite 
design and texture makes them a 
complete and compact musical 
experience. 

Following an encore and an 
Intermission, Gabor Szabo and 
his new seven piece band, Perfect 
Circle, tried desperately to win 
the show back fro m Mangione's 
unforgettable performance. 

I was sincerely impressed with 
Szabo's choice of musicians; 
Perfect Circle was a near perfect 
combination of talent with Louis 
Kabok on stand-up bass, John 
Smith on electric bass, Tony 
Ortega on woodwinds, Bob Morin 
on drums, Jim Stewart on 
classical guitar, Richard 
Thompson on keyboards, and 
most impressive of all, a man 
named Mayuto whose handling 
of percussion and rhythm 
throughout the set made it clear 
that Szabo is not afraid to 
surround himself with the best he 
can find . 

By the third number in the set, 
however, I found myself 51 ightly 
bored with the overemphasized 
subtlety of Szabo's guitar. For-
tunately, the groups rendition of 
"Rambler" brought the crowd 
back to I ife, though by th is time 
people had begun packing up to 
go home. 

Someone in the audience kept 
shouting "Rock Out' '', (much to 
my dismay). in the middle of 
Szabo's quiet, droney melodies, 
and apparently the group took 
note as they moved into some 
livelier, lighter numbers . 

The audience was appreciative 
of Szabo's effort, and half-
heartedly demanded an encore, 
but the excitement and en-
thusiasm that had been felt 
throughout the Mangione set 
seemed to have faded somewhat. 

With all due respect to Szabo 
and Perfect Circ le, it seems to me 
that Sunday night belonged 
rightfully to the Chuck Mangione 
Quartet .

A phone call. A simple, 
ten-cent phone call for a cab could 
save your friend's life. 

If your friend has been 
drinking too much, he shouldn't 
be driving. 

The automobile crash is the 
number one cause of death of people 
your age. And the ironic thing is 

., 

' . 

that the drunk drivers responsible 
for killing young people are most 
often other young people. 

Take a minute. Spend a 
dime. Call a cab. That's all. If you 
can't do that, drive him yourself. 
Or let him sleep on your couch. 

We're not asking you to be 
a doctor or a cop. Just a friend.
