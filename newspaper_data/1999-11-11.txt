BEIJING - With both sides 
expressing c,autious hope, senior 
American and Chinese trade offi-
cials met Wednesday in renewed 
negotiations over China's entry 
into the World Trade 
Organization. 

After a year of on-and-off 
negotiations, including a near-
miss in April, there is a wide 
sense that this week's talks may 
answer the key question: Is 
China ready to make the major 
ma rket-ogening concessions 
demanded by the United States 
and Europe?

THURSDAY. NOVEMBER II, 1999 
LGBT RESOURCE OFFICE 

Usa Huff/ Guardian 
ap ..... Up: Chancellor Robert Dynes participated in the opening ceremonies of the Lesbian, 
Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Resource Center. UCSD is the last UC campus to open such a center. 

A Place of Their Own 
DIVERSITY: Office formally opens with ribbon-cutting ceremony 
By LAUREN I. COARTNEY 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD Lesbian, Gay, 
Bisexual, Transgender (LGST) 
Resource Center held a dedi-
cation ceremony on Monday 
to mark its long-awaited open-
ing. . 

The purpose of the center is 
to provide a safe environment 
for everyone at UCSD to 
explore sexual orientation and 
gender issues. The cente~ will 
also promote campus diversity 
and provide infonnation and 
referral services for students 
with further ~uestions about 
sexual-orientahon issues. 

UCSD is the last UC cam-
pus to open an LGBT center. 

The resource office is locat-
ed in University Center 201. 

The center was publicly 
suggested in 1991. Plans did 
not go into action, however; 
until Revelle senior Scott 
Heath and a few of his fellow 
students wrote a formal pro-
posal in 1997. 

"What we were doing was 
creating dialogue and writing 
proposals for the center," 
Heath said. "There has to be a 
place where people can come 
and be themselves, when 
sometimes you can't even be 
yourself in your own dorm." 

The proposal prompted 
UCSD Chancellor Robert 
Dynes to plan for a "space for 
UCSD's lesbian, gay, bisexual 
and transgender communi-
ties" in his lo-Point Diversity 
Plan. 

"Making UCSD a safe and 
diverse community is 
extremely important to me," 
Dynes said at the dedication 
ceremony. "The central idea is 
to create a visible, safe spot, 
and we're moving in the right 
direction."

Pakistani 
Coup 
Debated 
FORUM: Government 
officials discussed the 
region's volatile future 
By PETE PRATO 
Guardian Reporter 

Tariq Azizuddin, the consula te 
general of Pakistan, and Barbara 
Walter, research director for the 
International Security at the 
Institute on Global Conflict and 
Cooperation, spoke at the Pepper 
Canyon Lodge Tuesday on current 
tensions surrounding last month 's 
military coup in Pakistan. 

On Oct. 12, General Pervez 
Musharraf of the Pakistani armed 
forces placed Pakistani Prime 
Minister Nawaz Sharif under 
house arrest and declared a state 
of martial law, marking the 25th 
year that Pakistan has been under 
military control in its 52-year 
existence as an independent 
country. 

Walter said during her speech 
that although rapid and dramatic 
shifts of power - especially to 
that of military control - are 
somewhat characteristic of 
Pakistan's governmental history, 
this most recent instance is of par-
ticular concern . This is the first 
time the military has had control 
over the people, in addition to 
access to nuclear weapons. She 
said that this is one of the main 
reasons why the international 
community has begun to take an 
added interest in the matter. 

A myriad of factors, Azizuddin 
said, led to the drastic shift in 
power in Pakistan. The British 
granted independence to Pakistan 
in 1947, freeing the region from the 
control of its neighboring country, 
India. Azizuddin said that because 
Pakistan lies on the outer fringe of 
fndia, it was treated as an extremi-
ty, not having been given the atten-
tion and support needed to devel-

A.S·. Council May Invest in Mutual Funds 
COUNCIL: Khullar said he supports using low-risk account to maximize gains for students 

'" 

By JENNIFER KAPLAN 
Staff~er 

Next winter quarter, the A.S. 
Council may begin to invest stu-
dent activity fees in low-risk 
mutual funds. 

Each year, 10 percent of A.S. 
funds are put into Mmandate 
reserves." The money is saved 
for financial emergencies or to 
aid in starting new services. 

A.S. Vice President Finance 
Eric Rovner said his intent is to 
Invest the money In secure stocks 
that wiD give a good. return with 

little risk. 
He added that in five to 10 

years, the interest accrued from 
investing the mandate reserves 
may amount to a very substantial 
sum of money that can ultimately 
be used to benefit students. 

AS. President Tesh Khullar 
said that Rovner has been very 
thorough in considering many 
investment options. 

M At first I was hesitant about 
investing student funds, but 
[Rovner] has done a lot of good 
research:' he said. 

Khullar added that by invest-

ing, students will ultimately get 
more for their money at minimal 
risk. 

"This will be a benefit to stu-
dents because the mandate 
reserves are something nobody 
expected the A.S. [Council) to 
have," he said. "Students will be 
getting more money than 
before. 

Communications Commiss-
ioner Bobby Kim said he sees 
potential problems with the pro-
gram. 

MThere are a lot of benefits to 
investing the mandate reserves, 

but there are also potential 
problems," Kim said . "The 
money will be put at risk, 
maybe not at a high risk, but 
there is always that possibility 
of something going wrong in 
the stock market." 

A.S. Vice President Internal 
Jennifer Lee said she trusts 
Rovner's research. 

"Last year when it was pre-
sented to council, there was a lot 
of positive feedback," Lee said. 
"We all feel confident in 
[Rovner's) decisions, but I do 
forsee future opposition."

Work-Ufe Honors UeSD 
Do You Suffer from SURVEY: Campus received awards for providing great employee benefits 

ALLERGIES/ASTHMA? By WINDER SEKHON 
Staff Writer 

UCSD recently received two 
awards at the fourth annual 
Leaders in Work-Life Awards 
Program. 

The program is sponsored by 
the Work-Life Coalition of San 
Diego to promote the benefits of 
employer-sponsored, work-life 
programs, policies and services. 
The awards program recognized 
all employers in San Diego County 
who are setting the standards of 
work-life policies and programs. 

Jonnie Craig-Winston, director 
of policy development for UCSD 
quality of work and human 
resources, said that UCSD ranked 
well among the top employers of 
San Diego County. This is the first 
year UCSD has applied for the 
award. 

"Nobody came as close as 
UCSD did," she said. "We met 47 
of the 52 components for the sec-
ond award and 13 of the 15 items 
categorized by the first award." 

Craig-Winston was assigned 
the task of completing a survey 
for the Work-Life Coalition of San 
Diego as a part of the application 
process. The survey was complet-
ed in three days with the aid of 
staff members from UCSD's 
Human Resources Department. 

Craig-Winston, who is also a 
Work-Life Coalition of San Diego 
board member, said the coalition 
is a vital asset to employees. 

"The Work-Life Coalition of 
San Diego mcludes non-tradi-
tiondl benefits, programs and ser-
vices available to help employees 
balance their work and personal 
lives," Craig-Winston said. 

The first aWilrrl presented to

UCSD was for its comprehensive 
benefits programs. UCSD pro-

egories assessed in the survey

T.R.I.A.D., an Escondido-based

hours, to continue receiving their 
salaries and benefits if they or their 
loved ones experience a medical 
problem. The continuation of their 
salaries and benefits is made possi-
ble as a result of other empfoyees 
donating their vacation hours to 
those who are in need. 

Another benefit provided by 
UCSD is the Employee Assistance 
Program. Under this program, an 
employee can get a specific num-
ber of counseling sessions through 
the Faculty IStaff Assistance 
Program Office if he or she is 
experiencing any emotional or 
psychological problems. 

The Service Awards Program 
celebrates and recognizes 
employees who have completed 
10, 15, 25 and 30 years of service 

at UCSD . 
Other UCSD benefits cate-

gories include general health and 
welfare benefits, new employee 
orientation, career development 
programs, preventive care pro-
grams, violence in the workplace 
programs, retirement and finan-
cial pl~nning, child cal':, f1exi.ble 
work-time options, tUition reIm-
bursement, domestic partners 
benefits, transportation reim-
bursement, including the Federal 
Pre-Tax Parking and Vanpooling 
Program, mentorship programs 
and elder care assistance. 

The second award, the 
Leadership in Work-Life Policies, 
was presented to UCSD for its 
overall work-life programs and 
policies. UCSD had 47 out of the 
52 work-life elements in the sur-
vey including those in the bene-
fits category award . 

More than 100 employers, 
media representatives and oth-
ers attended the Leaders in 
Work-Life Awards Program. 
Jacqueline Edwards, benefits 
manager at UCSD, was one of 
the participants from UCSD 
who attended the awards pro-
gram . Edwards said she was 
pleased with UCSD's perfor-
mance in receiving these two 
prestigious awards. 

"I was happy to see the uni-
versity recognized for its compre-
hensive benefits program and for 
what it has done for its employ-
ees," Edwards said. "Benefits are 
a significant portion of a person's 
overall compensation." 

The Work-Life Coalition of 
San Diego is a non-profit organi-
zation and is the only work-life 
organization in San Diego 
County.

How The Department of 
Justice Saved Capitalism 

Last Friday, U.S . District Judge Thomas Penfield 
J,!ckson issued his findings in the anti-trust case against 
the Microsoft Corporation, declaring the software giant 
a monopoly and .setting the stage for the imposition of 
sanctions against the company. 

. We at the Guardian applaud Judge Jackson's deci-
sion and hope that the Justice Department remains bull-
ish in settling the case with Microsoft, including when 
it comes time to impose sanctions if the company 
proves unc~perative in negotiating a settlement. 

Our only criticism is that the government took too 
long to take action. Microsoft has been facing allega-
tions of violating anti-trust laws since 1995. and it has 
taken four years for any signs of progress' to show. 
Even now the process of rectifying Microsoft's current 
monopolistic power has not yet begun. 

An unbelievable number of consumers have felt the 
impact of Microsoft·s heavy-handed marketing tactics. 
Consumers have been forced to buy Microsoft's oper-
ating system when purchasing computers from most 
major manufacturers, even if they had no intention of 
using it. They have been forced to pay the development 
costs of software Microsoft decided to bundle "for 
free" with unrelated products. They have been denied a 
wider choice of products due to Microsoft's suppres-
sion and marginalization of its competitors. 

Computer and software companies - competitors 
and osten ible allies of Microsoft alike - have been 
victimized by the company's greedy manipulation of 
the computer industry. Computer manufacturers have 
been bullied into licensing agreements, forcing them to 
sell Microsoft's operating system with their products, 
and companies marketing competing products have 
been the target of Microsoft's considerable economic 
clout in an effort to drive them out of business. 

No company has the right to exert this kind of 
power. Honda cannot require you to purchase a Honda 
lawn-mower when you buy one of its cars. Coke can-
not sell sodas for 5¢ a bottle with the intent of driving 
Pepsi out of business. Nike cannot threaten to stop pur-
chasing shoelaces from a supplier if it persists in doing 
business with Nike's competitors. Microsoft certainly 
does not have the right to use all these unfair practices. 

Despite the protests of Microsoft's lackeys, this case 
is not an example of the tyranny of big government. 
Our country is dedicated to the idea of a capitalist econ-
omy, but such a system does not work when it is abused 
by overbearing companies that use their influence to 
unfairly control the actions of producers and .con-
sumers. The people of the United States have entrusted 
the government with the power to make and enforce the 
laws that are in our best interest. When companies like 
Microsoft, which do not represent the popular will of 
the people, take it upon themselves to wield the kind of 
power reserved only for governments, it is the duty of 
our elected representatives to intervene and protect the 
populace. 

The Guardiall supports the fine institutions of

TELEVISION TRIES TO SHOCK 
VIEWERS INTO WATCHING 

COMMENTARY: TV 
networks sink to new 
lows to gain ratings 
By KIM HOOPER • 
Contributing Writer 

Television is an undeniable force 
in most of our lives.' It shapes our 
concepts of reality. When we watch 
reruns of "The Brady Bunch," we 
laugh to ourselves about the show's 
conservative nature, its strategic 
avoidance of sexual innuendos and 
subjects that would be considered 
"politically correct" in today's soci-
ety. 

We are now accustomed to, and 
almost immune to, sex-drenched 
scenes and violent action 
sequences. While such content has 
been more commonplace in feature 
films, it is also crossing over to the 
small screen. Consequently, when 
we watch a 3D-minute show focus-
ing on the dilemma of Jan Brady's 
middle-child syndrome, or Greg's 
latest attempt to be "groovy" or 
Alice's innocent affair with the 
town butcher, we are amused. 

In the present world, we are in 
the midst of a whirlwind of televi-
sion change, fueled by shows that 
are going to once-forbidden 
extremes to grab our attention in an 
increasingly competitive entertain-
ment market. I am completely sup-
portive of capitalism and pushing 
the boundaries of "the next big 
thing," but there's still a Carol 
Brady in me that wonders if we are 
going too far. 

The producers of. "Ally McBeal" 
roped in a huge audience two 
Monday's ago by promising the 
most erotic scene ever witnessed on 
television. In fact, it roped in the 
show's largest audience ever! 

I admit that I tuned in to watch 
Ally's latest lip-locking antics; the 
episode revolved around the myste-
rious attraction between Ally and 
one of her female co-workers, both 
outwardly heterosexual. Their 
curiosity about this attraction results 

in a paSSionate, 2S second kiss. 
SubconSCiously I knew I should 

be shocked to see this on broadcast 
television, but I wasn't, Not that 
long ago showing an intimate inter-
lude between a man and a woman 
was considered risque. Carol and 
Mike Brady would sit in bed and 
address each other as "Mr." and 
"Mrs." before exchanging a little 
peck on the lips and giggling as 
they slipped under the covers. Fade 
to black. 

That was only a few decades ago. 
Yet, with the rapid growth of the 
media and the competition between 
networks for viewer ratings, televi-
sion shows have rushed to provide 
the shock-value entertainment that 
draws ~ple to a show. Maybe this 
is merely an evolution of the medi-
um, a sign of progress ... but I won-
der what the Brady family would 
think. 

Twenty-four hours after the "Ally 
McBeal" episode, which went fur-
ther than any other show in recent 
memory, I found myself in front of 
the television once again,..vaiting for 
my jaw to drop. I was not disap-
pointed. For the first time ever on 
television, a man was shown directly 
touching a woman's breast on "Will 
and Grace." Keep in mind that this 
show airs at 9 PM when children 
could be flipping through the chan-
nels. Like the "Ally McBeal" 
episode, this show was also number 
one in its time slot. 

I wonder what this says about 
our culture. "Will and Grace" is not 

usually a top-rated show, but 
advertisements showing breast-
touching certainly made it number 
one this past week. During the tap-
ing of the controversial episode, 
there were observers making sure 
that the scene did not cross the lines 
of decency. Strangely, cupping the 
breast was allowed, but any other 
touching was prohibited. The scene 
appeared awkward to me, some-
how pioneering, but, as a product 
of our culture, I found that I was 
not surprised. Instead, 1 thought to 
myself, "Not again!" 

As shows continue to compete for 
ratings, there is no telling where tele-
vision will go next. There seems to 
be a race to reach the limits of decen-
cy in which writers attempt to 
exploit their demented imaginations 
as much as possible. Television is 
becoming less and less realistic and 
more and more based on extremes, 
distortion and fantasy. I do not doubt 
that the escapism of television is 
what appeals to most viewers, but 
the detachment from reality is get-
ting out of hand. 

Heterosexual women kissing 
each other used to be a stereotypi-
cal male fantasy, but now "Ally 
McBeal" has suggested that it is a 
normal activity, which challenges 
the very foundation of our sexuali-
ty. 1 can only imagine how confus-
ing the episode might have been for 
a teenager going through puberty! 
Similarly, a man touching a 
woman's breast was depicted as 
something that is not only natural, 
but amusing. I do not think that Mr. 
Brady would want his sons to see 
this action as something casual. 

Extreme television taints our 
views of what is acceptable and real-
istic. While two heterosexual women 
kissing and a man touching a 
woman's breast on network televi-
sion may not be that off-the-wall or 
offensive to some viewers, it is nec-
essary to consider the future of tele-
vision and also to think of the vul-
nerable minds that will be absorbing 
the media's messages like waiting 
sponges.

aeauty Is More Than Skin Deep Abolish Fee Stickers 
COMMENTARY: Some men have unrealistic views of women at UCSD COMMENTARY: Promised reform yet to come 
By ANGELA CARRIER 
Contributing Writer 

If you want to be happy for tile 
rest of yOl/r life, /lever make a prftty 
woman yOl/r wife ... 

It has been said that nine out 
of 10 girls in the UC system are 
hot, and that the 10th one goes to 
UC San Diego. I first heard this 
myth before coming to San 
Diego and paid it little attention, 
since it seemed like such a nar-
row-minded point of view. 

Little did I know that many of 
our dear male counterparts actu-
ally believe it. Recently, I was sit-
ting in Price Center Plaza and 
couldn't help but overhear a 
group of guys' loud conversa-
tion. They were complaining 
about how the girls here are "no 
good" and how all the San Diego 
State University girls look like 
Playboy bunnies. As much as I . 
wanted to turn around and tell 
them that they were not of 
Chippend.!'le caliber themselves, 
I held my tongue and laughed at 
them privately. 

The overheard conversation 
reveals an obsession with outer 
appearances. Has anyone at 
this campus ever heard the say-
ing "beauty is only skin deep"? 
Are we paying thousands of 
dollars in tuition to gawk at 
beautiful people, or to get an 
education? 

In an attempt to broaden the 
view of the narrow-minded, I 
would like to propose a different 
form of beauty that, in the long 
run, will surpass the value of 
outer appearances. It is called 
intelligence. 

Being accepted into a UC 

school is not an easy feat. There 
are tests to tak~, strict require-
ments to meet and fierce compe-
tition to overcome. The females 
that are accepted to UCSD must 
meet these high standards to 
even be considered for admis-
sion. Female applicants must be 
responsible and highly dedicat-

Can a guy honestly say 
that he would rather have 
a cute, dumb girlfriend 
than an average-lOOking 
smart girlfriend? Some

yes. and that is their 
choice. But where will 
they go when they want

ed to getting work done. I do not 
recall having to send a photo-
graph as part of the application 
process. 

If some of these males 
stopped for a moment to consid-
er how intelligent they are them-
selves, and then considered the 
fact that the females on this cam-
pus have to be just as bright as 
them in order to be here, things 
might be different. 

Females shouldn't be subject-
ed to such generalizations, any-
way. Women have enough pres-
sure on them from the media 
and the fashion world to be 
"beautiful." Being constantly 
bombarded with images of

supermodels and movie stars, 
which are supposed to be ideal 
women, does not feel good. 
Even when women come to col-
lege - supposedly a place 
where they can expand their 
horizons and get an ed~cation­
that absurd standard is still pre-
sent, and ridiculous myths such 
as the low quality of female stu-
dents on this campus continue to 
circulate unjustifiably. 

Can a guy honestly say that he 
would rather have a cute, dumb 
girlfriend than an average-look-
ing smart girlfriend? Some will 
undoubtedly answer yes, and 
that is their choice. But where will 
they go when they want to have 
an in-depth discussion about 
something intelligent? 

Outer appearances will please 
the eye and suffice for a while, bu t 
soon, beauty will need to come 
from within. Besides, if being sur-
rounded by "hot chicks" is such a 
vital need for these guys, perhaps 
they should have applied to a 
university that offers a degree in 
"girl watching." 

This is not meant to general-
ize all the male students at 
UCSD. I have heard many say 
that they found the women here 
to be quite attractive. With a pos-
itive attitude like this, they will 
probably have the best luck find-
ing a girlfriend. 

There is no valid way to mea-
sure the degree of highly attrac-
tive women at UCSD. There 
could never be a consensus 
because, after all, beauty is in the 
eye of the beholder.

uiew, get alll/gly gIrl to marry yOI/.

By JUUA KULlA-MADER 
Senior Staff Writer 

Two years ago, the university 
forced all UCSD students to trade 
in their lovable J.D. cards, deco-
rated with a smiling Sun God, for 
brand new AT&T calling cards, 
which also doubled as J.D. cards. 

We were told that the replace-
ment was a necessary technologi-
cal advancement and would even-
tually leaq to thl! eradication of the 
dreaded registration sticker. 

At the time the transition was 
being proposed, UCSD Bursar 
Howard Fisher praised the easily 
breakable cards for their lack of 
sticker slots in the Guardiall 
("Bursar Clears Confusion Regard-
ing New J.D. Card," Oct. 2, 1997). 

"There are only a couple of 
spaces on this card for stickers 
because we want to do away with 
stickers," Fisher said. "Stickers are 
no longer needed for RIMAC, 
College Club or Triton Plus." 

Well, it's been two years and 
my J.D. card still looks like a 
modern art exhibit, adorned with 
registration stickers from the last 
two years, a Career Services 
Center sticker, a RIMAC sticker 
and a bus sticker, along with sev-
eral other tacky decorations. 

After collecting this massive 
amount of stickers, my J.D. card 
has begun to resemble Geisel 
Library, making it rather awk-
ward to carry around. 

But, I can live with having a 
flying saucer-esque J.D. card. 
What I can't live with is the feel-
ing that I've been had. The feeling 
that we've all been had . 

I faithfully waited in the long 
lines to get my new card and hap-

pity watched as the nice lady at the 
Bursar 's office tore myoid card in 
two. I did this because I trusted the 
university. I was confident it had 
my best interests in mind. 

Looking back, however, I real-
ize that what we were being issued 
was nothing more than an AT&T 
calling card. At the time, I thought 
AT&T was just being friendly by 
offering to pay for our new cards. 
Yeah, right. I realize now that what 
AT&T was really doing was look-
ing for a way to force students to 
carry around its calling cards. 

I don't want a calling card, and 
I don't want a complementary 
AT&T T-shirt. What I want is what 
we were promised in the first place 
- no more registration stickers. 

Waiting in line at the beginning 
of each quarter IS frustrating and 
time consuming. Even more 
annoying is the fact that it 's 
impractical to wait a few weeks for 
the lines to get smaller, as doing so 
will prevent you from entering 
RIMAe, checking out library 
books or buying concert tickets. 

Two years ago, the administra-
tion promised us a better way of 
verifyi'1~ our registration. 
According to the people who sup-
ported thE' program, our cards are 
cuneniiy able to be used to verify 
students' registration without the 
stickers. That's what the magnetic 
strip is for. So, what's the problem? 

The problem is U1at we've been 
conned by both UCSD and AT&T. 
We've not forgotten the lofty 
claims they made, even if they 
have. But, it's not too late for the 
university to make up for these 
false promises. All will be forgiven 
if registration stickers miraculous-
ly disappear next quarter. 

Will your GRE score 
be high enough?

Veterans Deserve Services That Repay Their Y8ars of ~C8 
Editor: 

We have set aside Nov. 11 as 
Veteran's Day, a special day we 
dedica te to those brave men and 
women who have risked their 
lives to defend our freedom. On 
this last Veteran's Day of the cen-
tury, we reflect back on how so 
ma ny Americans have fought 
bravely during times of war and 
stood vig ilant during times of 
peace. They have made us proud. 

On Veteran's Day, and every 
day, America's veterans deserve 
our thanks. They sacrificed much 
and have done without in order 
to help thei r country. In recent 
yea rs, veterans programs have 
been cut dramatically in order to 
achieve a balanced budget. Now, 
when we have projected budget 
surpluses, it is time to renew our 
commitment to those to whom 
we owe so much. 

Without an increase in funding 
for ve terans programs, the 
Veterans Association (VA) predicts 
that it w ill have to disenroll veter-
ans and deny them access to VA 
health care. Among those veterans 
wou ld be those exposed to agent 
orange, ionizing rad iation, envi-
ronmental hazards and the "toxic 
soup" of the Persian Gulf. VA offi-
cials predict layoffs of at least 8,500 
employees, hospita l closures and 
termination of many types of ben-
efIts, including inpatient psychi-
atric and substance abuse care. 

The medical care and benefi ts 
that veterans were promised have 
already been cut back to danger-
ous levels. VA hospi tals are d is-
charging veterans with 
Alzheimer's Disease because of 
Inadequate space and funding . 
Almost 40 percent of veterans are 
waiting more than one month for 
an appointment with a doctor. In 
Kentucky, a doctor was authorized 
to provide care to only 35 of the 

500 veterans suffering from 
Hepatitis C. an often fatal disease. 
Persian Gulf veterans are suffering 
from undiagnosed illnesses and 
have trouble getting proper care. 

Lack of medical care is not the 
only pressing issue facing 
America's veterans - homeless-
ness is a frightening reality, as well. 
Among all homeless men, 40 per-
cent are veterans. On any given 
night, 270,000 veterans are home-
less. To help combat this problem, I 
strongly supported the Veterans 
Benefits Act of 1999, which 
increased funding for employment 
and training services to help veter-
ans re-enter the work force and 
support themselves. This bill was 
passed overwhelmingly in the 
House of Representatives, and its 
passage is a major achievement of 
this year. 

As a senior member of the 
House Committee on Veterans' 
Affairs, I am fortunatt to know 
many brave veterans and to work 
with them daily on issues that are 
important to the veteran commu-
nity. The stories of Service to one's 
country that veterans tell me are 
often deeply moving. Too often, 
however, I also hear 'stories of 
how deserving American veter-
ans are told that medical care is 
unavailable. I have worked hard 
to increase funding for veterans 

prog~ams because I believe that 
those who have sacrificed so 
much for our country deserve to 
be well cared for. 

Congress can help America's 
veterans by ensuring that medical 
care, counseling. substance abuse 
treatment and job training are 
available. In San Diego, you can 
make a difference in the lives of 
local veterans by volunteering 
your time to work With veterans. 
You can teach your children that 
the price of democracy is high -

esting assumptions regarding the 
so-called Y2K bug. I agree with 
most of what sh~ says, however, 
Ms. Pierce neglects to consider 
the possibilities that even our

While most experts agree that 
the Y2K bug will not cause the

over what will happen when the 
clock strikes 12 a .m. OIl Jan. 1,

inevitably, some will lose power.

fires . Third scenario: is that a 
computer malfunction in a 
Russian radar computer will give 
the erroneous signal of a nuclear 
attack on Russia, which the U.S. 
government ac~ually considers a 
possibility. This will cause the 
technician at the computer to 
pass the information along a 
short chain of command, one that 
does not even reach the Russian 
president, resulting in the launch 
of the Russian nuclear arsenal. 

Washington thinks of this as 
such a threat that it has invited 
Russia to participate in an early 
detection program in Colorado 
on Dec. 31, 1999. American and 
Russian officials will sit around 
an American Y2K-compliant 
computer and watch to see if any 
weapons of mass destruction are 
fired anywhere in the world . 
This method will hopefully elim-

lie in the United States but else-

. States. 

Most people in the United 
States will be fairly secure in their 
homes, apartments or bomb shel-
ters. But the threat of a nuclear 
attack exists as long as there are 
nuclear weapons in the world. 

One main concern for the U.S. 
government is Russia. There are 
several feasible nuclear scenarios. 
First scenario: Nothing will hap- . 
pen. Second scenario: The main 
frame that controls the Russian 
nuclear arsenal will crash. The 
Russians operate a system called 
"Dead Hand," a Cold War relic 
that, in the event of a nuclear 
attack on Russia, automatically 
fires its nuclear wea pons. The 
system assumes that all Russians 
in command position are dead if 
it does not receive a "no fire"

There are many other possibil-
ities of what could happen not 
only in Russia, but all over the

France Benefits From Reduced Work Week 
PFASTATT, France - last 

year, the Beyer family, which 
owns a small jam and fruit pre-
serves plant here near the Swiss 
border, made a proposal to its 18 
employtes: Would they like a 35-
hour wbrkweek and continue to 
be paid for working 39 hours? 

To no one's great surprise, the 
employees said yes. "An hour 
more for yourself is an hour 
more," said Christiane Grimm, 
whose job includes slapping 
labels on jars, sorting through 
crates of fruit and watching over 
bubbling vats of jam. "There's lots 
you can do with it." 

Surprisingly, the Beyers 
ended up happy, too. The com-
pany, one of thousands of French 
enterprises that have reorga-
nized their businesses because of 
a 16-month-old law creating one 
of the shortest work weeks in the 
world, believes that it is far bet-
ter off than before. 

In the reshuffle, Philippe 
Beyer split his 18 employees into 
two teams and staggered their 
shifts. His factory here in the 
Alsace region now operates 12 
hours a day, up from eight. And 
it produces 30 percent more than 
it did last year with only two 
extra employees. 

"It sedms to be having a 
backdoor effect. It is 
providing a very good 
opportunity to renovate 
the workplace. And it is 
introducing these 
elements - productivity, 
flexibility - quietly, 
without triggering social 
unrest. So even if the 
direct goal of job creation 
is not achieved, it may . 
still not necessarily be a 
bad thing for the 
economy." 

~,.", 
French economist 

The promise of 39 hours of 
pay for 35 hours of work was a 
campaign plank that helped cat-
apult Prime Minister Lionel 

Jospin's leftist coalition to 
power in the 1997 parliamentary 
elections. And it remains the glue 
that keeps Socialists, Communists 
and Greens together. It was aimed 
at creating as many as 1 million 
jobs in a country that has strug-

~'!"[.]~'!1.~liil"~ 

gled with a double-digit rate of 
unemployment for years. 

But many experts think that 
this bold experiment - which 
business leaders had warned 
would cripple France's economy 
- is not going to be a cure-all for 
the nearly 3 million unemployed. 

Instead, it could accomplish 
something the leftist governing 
coalition never aimed for: a kind 
of housecleaning in the French 
workplace that will tear the cob-
webs from French industry and 
lead to a more prodl!ctive and 
flexible work force, as it did at

"The primary goal of this pol-
icy is very unlikely," said 
Emanuel Ferry, an economist at 
Banque National de Paris, who 
is studying the policy. "But it 
seems to be having a backdoor 
effect. It is providing a very 
good opportunity to rencvate 
the worKplace. And it is intro-
ducing these elements - pro-
ductiVity, flexibility - quietly, 
without triggering social unrest. 
So even if the direct goal of job 
creation is not achieved, it may 
still not necessarily be a bad 
thing for the economy."

CHINA: 
Other countries 
watched talks closely 
ContInued froM ..... 1 

The U.S. trade representative, 
Charlene Barshefsky, along with 
presidential economic adviser 
Gene Sperling and other offi-
cials, arrived Tuesday night for 
what is supposed to be two days 
of talks. 

Sperling said Wednesday 
morning that President Clinton 
had sent him along " to make 
clear his belief that we have a his-
torical opportunity." 

The Chinese were represented 
by Shi Guangsheng. the foreign 
trade minister, and officials from 
the central bank and affected 
ministries. Opening the session 
Wednesday morning, Shi said 
China was "positive and 
earnest." 

Other countries are closely 
watching the Beijing talks, and 
not only because of the potential-
ly huge economic effects if China 
is admitted to the organization 
that sets international trade rules 
and works for less fettered com-
merce. 

China's willingness to open 
up cherished industries to global 
competition will also signal its 

NEWS 7 

commitment to fa r-reaching 
domestic economic and socia l 
changes, economis ts say, and 
may also revea l the power of 
reformers in the government, 
especia lly Prime Minister Zhu 
Rongji. 

Zhu was embarrassed in 
Washing ton in April w hen 
Clinton rejected as inadequate 
what the Chinese fe lt were major 
concessions. 

Since then, Chinese industries 
that would be threatened by a 
rapid market opening, like 
telecommunications and automo-
bile production, have fought to 
preserve more protections. The 
leadership has become increas-
ingly worried about a threat to 
social stability if unemployment 
worsens in the short term 
because of reductions in tariffs 
and investment barriers. 

Clinton is said to regret his 
failure to reach agreement in 
April. He now sees securing 
China's admission to the World 
Trade Organization as an impor-
tant foreign policy goal, but he 
cannot relent on the commercial 
terms, because he needs the sup-
port of business interests and 
Congress.

Attack Remembered as 
Survivors Join in Prayer 

Congress Snarls Health Bills 
CLEVELAND - In a solemn 

encounter, three U 5. Army veter-
ans and four South Korean civil-
ians who stood at opposite ends 
of a chaotic incident half a centu-
ry ago, met here Wednesday to 
pray in a service of remembrance 
of that event, which the Koreans 
described as a massacre by 
American forces. 

The service, held at a down-
town church under the ausfices 
of the National Counci of 
Churches, was the first meeting 
on American soil between former 
soldiers and Korean survivors of 
the incident in July 1950, the first 
month of the Korean War, in 
which as many as 400 civilians 
were reportedly killed when they 
were strafed by military 'planes 
and later machine-gunned by sol-
diers at a railway bridge near a 
village called No Gun Ri. 

Although survivors and their 
families have demanded recog-
nition of the events at No Gun Ri 
for many years, the incident 
there was not widely publicized 
in the United St~tes until six

WASH£NGTON - A bill to 
provide health insurance to hun-
dreds of thousands of disabled 
people, which had passed with 
overwhelming bipartisan sup-
port in the House and the 
Senate, became snarled 
\Vednesday in a tangle of parti-
san disagreements, raising 
doubts about whether it would 
become law before Congress 
adjourns for the year. 

Similar disputes delayed 
action on a sepa ra te bill to 
increase Medicare payments to 
most hospitals, nursing homes 
and other health care providers. 
This bill, intended to undo some 
of the budget cuts adopted in 
1997, would make a profound 
change in national health policy, 
reducmg huge disparities in 
what Medicare pays to train doc-
tors in different parts of the 
country. 

The bill would slash 
Medicare payments to many 
teaching hospitals in New York, 
while increasing payments to 
teaching hospitals in California 
and Texas, among other states. 

Different versions of the bill 
to provide health insurance for 
disabled workers sailed through 
the Senate, 99-0, and the House, 
412-9, earlier this year. But nego-
tiations have bogged down on 
the question of how to pay the 
comparatively modest cost, less 
than $1 billion over five years. 

The bill would slash 
Medicare payments to 
many teaching hospitals 
in New York, while 
increasing payments to 
teaching hospitals in 
California and Texas, 
among other states. 

Supporters or" the health 
insurance legislation said it 
would be the most important 
step to help the disabled since 
passage of the Americans With 
Disabilities Act in 1990. 

People with disabilities have 
strongl), supported the bill, 
which would allow them to keep 

Medicaid and Medicare cover-
age after they return to work. 
Under current law, they often 
lose such coverage if they earn a 
significant amount of money. 
The current law thus discour-
ages many disabled people from 
working or trying to work. 

Advocates for the disabled 
and Democratic senators said 
they might oppos.:! the bill , 
which is meant to help people on 
disability rolls go back to work, 
if Republicans financed it by cut-
ting other social programs. 

"We cannot support any leg-
islation that would advance the 
lives of people with disabilities 
on the backs of poor and midd le-
class America ns," sa id Pat 
Wright, a lawyer a t the 
Disability Rights Education and 
Defense Fund . 

Republicans said that 
President Clinton was free to 
suggest other ways of covering 
the cost, but tha t he had not 
done so.

Federal Court Stops Michigan from 
Testing Welfare Applicants for Drug Use 

DETROIT - A federal judge 
Wednesday temporarily shot 
down Michigan's unusual pro-
gram to test welfare applicants 
for drug use. 

Under a pilot program that 
started last month, Michigan 
had been requiring welfare 
applicants at three sites, 
including one in Detroit, to 
pass a drug test or be denied 
benefits. 

Michigan is the first state 
with such a program, which has 
been criticized by social work-
ers, civil libertarians and some 
welfare recipients. 

The American Civil Liberties 
Union sued the state to stop the 
drug tests, arguing tha t they vio-
lated the privacy o f welfare 
applicants and the constitutional 
protections against unreason-
able search and seizure. 

Wednesday, Judge Victoria A. 

Robel'ts of U.S. District Court for 
the Eastern District of Michigan, 
Northern Division, granted a 
temporary restraining order that 
stops the tests at least until Dec. 
14, when another hea ring is 
scheduled . The judg~ said she 
granted the order because the 
drug tests are probably uncon-
stitutional. 

Kary L. Moss, executive 
director of the Michigan office of 
the ACLU, said the ruling means 
"that for the time being, welfare 
applicants will not be forced to 
choose between their constitu-
tional rights and providing for 
their families. " The state said it 
would comply with the court 
order but believes it w ill u lti-
mately preva il. 

"We look forward to return-
ing to this program, which was 
allowed by federal legislation, 
enacted by the Michiga n 

Legislature and supported by 
our customers and the general 
public," Douglas E. Howard, 
director of Michigan's welfare 
agency, the Family 
Independence Agency, said. 
"The drug testing pilot is an 
opportunity to help individuals 
find employment and to 
strengthen families. We believe 
it is the right thing to do." 

Karen Smith, a spokeswoman 
for the agency, said 8.1 percent 
of the applicants tested positive 
for drug use. No one refu sed the 
test, Smith said . 

Of the 258 tes ts J na lyzed, 
237 tes ted nega ti ve wh ile 21 
tested positive. O f those, th ree 
tes ted posi t ive fo r cocai ne, 
while the rest tested positive

PAKISTAN: 
Consul said civil 
law remains intact 

op a self-sufficient democracy. 
The Muslims that took control 

of Pakistan upon its acquisition of 
independence inherited a system 
that lacked a constitution, an elect-
ed parliament and most of the . 
other prerequisites needed to culti-
vate a stable democratic regime. 

For the past 52 years, 
Pakistan's economy and social 
state of affairs have suffered. 
Sixty-two percent of the popula-
tion is illiterate. Most of those that 
can read live in urban areas, but 
because Pakistan is primarily agri-
culturally driven, 75 percent of the 
population lives in rural areas. 
BeCause of the low literacy rate 
and the low level of development, 
operations have continued to go 
on haphazardly, leading to the 
rapid rise and fall of four separate 
governments in the last 11 years. 

The coup was brought about 
when Prime Minister Sharif termi-
nated Musharraf as commanding 
general of the armed forces 
because the general had been pres-
suring him to send soldiers into an 
area known as Kashmir. The gen-
eral then placed Sharif under 
house arrest and placed the coun-
try in a state of martial law. 

Azizuddin said that 
Musharraf has made his prime 
objective the restoration of 
democracy, which he feels cannot 
be achieved until the corrupt 
practices and politicians have 
been weeded out. 

The Kashmir region has been 
a point of contention between 
India and Pakistan for almost the 
entire time that Pakistan ha3 had 
independence. 

Tensions have now been raised, 
as Pakistan is led by a man who 
previously urged Sharif to send 
soldilrs into Kasrunir. Azizuddin 
said that because India is so much 
larger, Pakistan spends 25 percent 
of its budget on defense. 

"As long as we have a neigh-
bor eight times our size, we can't 
afford to lose our guard," 
Azizuddin said. "It is a difficult 
time." 

In her speech, Walter dis-
cussed the United States' position 
on the issue and the concerns 
being raised throughout the 
international community. 

She said that the United States 
has more than just Pakistan's social 

'and economic health to consider: 
Pakistan shares an 1,800 mile bor-
der with Afghanistan, a country 
that also possesses nuclear 
weapons, and is also in a poor state 
of affairs socially and economical-
ly. 

Pakistan also borders China, 
another nuclear power. Walter 
said that Clinton will visit India 

Thursday, November 11, 1999 

in February, but he has made no 
mention of visiting Pakistan. 

"This is going to make China 
nervous," Walter said. "The U.S. 
needs to be careful of seeming too 
much in favor of one side." 

Azizuddin said that although 
the rest of the world seems to be 
somewhat unnerved by the mili-
tary takeover in Pakistan, the 
Pakistani people are actually quite 
happy with the situation. He said 
that Musharraf feels he wa~ justi-
fied in his taking of power because 
Sharif and his government were 
not adequately serving the people. 
Musharraf promised to improve 
the economy and to safeguard the 
country from falling into the same 
chaotic state it has been in for the 
past 11 years. 

"The promises are good and 
have appealed to the people, so 
they have accepted military con-
trol," Azizuddin said . 

He said that civil law has 
remained intact in the country 
and the courts are still running. 

"Our intentions are peaceful," 
Azizuddin added. "We do not 
mean to harm anybody. What we 
do mean to do is restore democ-
racy in Pakistan." 

Walter, on the other hand, said 
she was skeptical of the military's 
ability to set the proper checks and 
balances for itself that would be 
needed to place the power back in 
the hands of the people. 

"That is what a democracy is, 
when the people have the major-
ity say in the govemment," she 
said. "The military is trained to 
fight wars, not run countries." 

Azizuddin said that it remains 
to be seen whether tensions will 
arise between Pakistan and other 
countries. 

"Pakistan will not change its 
foreign policy," he said. "It will 
continue to seek good relations 
with other countries of the world, 
particularly with its neighbors." 

Although both countries do 
possess nuclear weapons and 
nuclear technology, it is not known 
whether either country has the 
necessary systems to deliver and 
deploy the weapons. These sys-
tems can be more difficult to come 
by than the weapons themselves. 

The conference was the second 
part of a two-part series on the sit-
uation in Pakistan. Nandini 
Harihareswara, a Roosevelt senior 
who heads the International 
Affairs Group, organizes forums 
once a week that deal with inter-
national issues. . 

Harihareswara said she held 
the program on Pakistan to bring 
up discussions about security 
and regional issues related to the 
Pakistani coup. 

"I wish more people came, but 
I think this program went really 
well," she said . 

Harihareswara added that the 
hour-and-a-half weekly programs 
are part of RO?sevelt college's 
focus on international affairs.

Kevin Smitlis latest film explores the boundaries offaith, religion and mindless fart jokes 

T WO fallen angles (Ben Affleck , and Matt Damon, "Good Will Hunting"), who have been condemned to spend eternity on Earth, have discovered a 
loophole that will allow them to re-enter 
heaven. As part of an effort to draw more 
people to its faith, the Roman Catholic 
Church has passed down a new doctrine, 
decreeing that anybody who enters a specific 
church on a certain day shall have <Ill their 
sins forgiven. 

Unfortunately, should these angles suc-
ceed in their goal of entering the church, the 
result would create a paradox between God's 
will (to keep the angles out) and dogmatic 
law (to forgive their sins) and would there-
fore bring about the end of all existence. 

Normally, the omnipotent and all-know-
ing God could take care of such a problem 
quite easily. Unfortunately, no one seems to 
know where she is. 

Instead, one of God's messengers (Alan 
Rickman, "Die Hard") calls upon a woman 

named Bethany, (Linda Fiorentino, "Men In 
Black") who is in the midst of her own crisis 
of faith, to stop the renegade angles from get-
ting inside the church. Slowly, this reluctant 
savior comes to grips with her duty and 
agrees to the holy crusade. 

However, there are other forces at work. 
Azrael Oason Lee, "Chasing Amy"), a minion 
of the devil, has escaped from hell and sets 
out to ensure that the angles succeed in their 
quest. Azrael instructs his henchmen to 
destroy Bethany before she can stop the 
angels. 

This, of course, is where Jay and Silent 
Bob Oason Mewes and Kevin Smith) enter 
the plot. After defending Bethany from an 
attack by Azrael's stooges, the self-described 
"hetem-life mates" take Bethany under their 
dubiously protective wing, and the three set 
off for the site of the inevitable showdown 
between good and evil- which is, appropri-
ately enough, in New Jersey, the site of many 
of Smith's films. 

Along the way, the trio grows larger as 

they encounter the 13th apostle (Chris Rock, 
"Lethal Weapon 4"), who offers his help in 
exchange for having his name rightfully 
inserted into the BibTe alongside the rest of 
the apostles' , names. (He was apparently 
omitted due to the color of his skin, despite 
the fact that Jesus Christ himself was appar-
ently black.) 

Shortly thereafter, the gang also meets 
Serendipity (Salma Hayek, "Fools Rush In"), 
a muse who's been trying to inspire herself 
rather than others after not receiving any of 
the credit for inspiring 19 of the 20 highest-
grossing films of all time. (She had nothing to 
do with "Home Alone," someone sold his or 
her soul to the devil to make that movie a 
success.) 

As time runs out and with God still 
nowhere to be found, it's up to Bethany and 
her friends to save the world and rediscover 
Bethany's faith. .

Love Is Truly a Horrible Bitch Goddess 
The Illusion'is the latest production of the Lyceum Theatre in downtown San Diego 
By JEREMY GRAY 
Senior Staff Writer 

Is the true illusion love or life? 
uch is the question posed by the 

theilter production "The Illu-
sion." Combining a love story, a 
shil meful father and a hea lthy 
wallop of magic, "The Ill usion" 
bo rders on normalcy, bu t ulti-
mately proves sa tisfy ing and 
rewarding. 

As the lights dim, the regret-
ful, ilging father Pridamant Oohn 
Cilmpion) combs the recesses of a 
cave to proposition Alcandre 
(Mike Genovese), a hermit magi-
Cian whose specia l talent is the 
ability to conjure up images of the 
past. Matamore aba ndoned his 
son and now wishes to see what 
events he has missed. 

The tale of you ng Calisto (the 
name changes are partly the 
magicIan's fault, occurring when-
ever a significant amount of time 
has passed), played by Mikael 
Salaza r, presents his quest to 
make Melibea / lsabelle/ Hippoly-
ta (Ca milia Sanes) love hill] . His 
goofy swagger and unbridled 
innocence could never get him 
into trouble, much less murder ... 
or cou ld they? 

As this production seems to 
Mgue, love is a horrible bitch 
goddess. With Pridamant wa tch-
ing just a few feet beyond but 
unable to warn or protect his son, 
love turns even the most well-
meaning men into slaves of 
despair and immoral action . Cal-
isto's ascent into nobility is simi-
larly a descent into greed, arro-

Luckily, "The Illusion" is not 
sho~t on comedy, with the biggest 
laughs coming from the bum-
bling, egocentric Matamore (Ron 
Campbell), whose comic delivery 

and slapstick gives a nice balance merely a guise for true cowardice, 
to the otherwise heavy-handed his poetry simply the babblings of 
love story. Like a symbol of the a washed-up man who wants no 
old world trying to keep up with more than to win the fair maid-
the new, Matamore's bravery is en's hand if only one last time. 

In his swashbuckling, drunken 
captain costume, Campbell plays 
the role of Matamore with flair,

Prepare for Trouble and Make It Double 
There are far worse ways to spend your time than at Pokemon: The First Movie' 
By JEREMY GRAY 
Sentor Staff Wfller 

You cannot hope to under-
stand Poke-fever, you can only 
hope to contain it. To grasp just 
how powerful this phenomenon 
is, "Pokemon: The First Movie" 
has been bumped up from its 
origina l Nov. 12 release date to 
Wednesday, Nov. 10. Why? Fan 
anticipa tion was so strong that 
the movie studio decided it 
would be best to rewa rd the 
flocks of die-hard fans begging 
fo r tickets. George Lucas, are you 
listening? 

The story opens on a proto-
type Pokemon named MewTwo 
who learns to understand his life 
and his world as a reality he is not 
wi lling to accept. As the most 
powerful Pokemon ever created, 
he begins using his powers to 
destroy everyone around him: fhe 
scientists who unjustly created 
him as an experiment, the Poke-
mon masters who have seeming-
ly placed their Pokemon into 
slavery and the Pokemon them-
selves for demonstrating weak 
wi ll. What a meanie! 

Anime fans may liken the 
theme to a watered-down version 
of "Ghost in the Shell," and there 
are more than a few references to 
the "Star Wars" series, from the 
opening credits ("MewTwo 
Strikes Back") to the Princess 
Leia-like hologram message 
delivered to Pokemon trainer 
Ash, inviting him to a secret 
Pokemon tournament. 

Courtesy of Warner Bros. 
iibercut.: Pikachu (above) and Ash star in their first outing on the silver screen in the mind-bogglingly popular 'Pokemon' movie. 

Once at the tournament, it is 
up to Ash, along with his friends 

Misty and Brock - and Team 
Rocket to an extent - to discover 
the secret to stopping MewTwo 
from destroying the world. Along 
for the ride is the super cute 

Pikachu, whom you either 
already love or would love to rip 
apart. Most children prefer the 
former. Most college students 
would rather spend an intimate

Album Reviews ............ ........ .. , . .....

Showbiz 

--
-
** Showbiz is the debut album 

from Muse, a new alternative 
band hailing from England. 
According to the band's mem-
bers, they come from a typically 
quiet and dull English seaside 
town that, for teenagers, is "a liv-
ing hell all year round." Lucky 
for these guys, S/lOwbiz is any-
thing but quiet and dull. 

Matthew Bellamy, Chris Wol-
stenholme and Dominic Howard 
aspired to become musicians early 
in life. They formed their first 
band at the age of thirteen as a 
revolt against the tedium of small-
town life. 

Hints of that rebellious nature 
can be found in some of the more 
moody and forceful tracks, such 
as "Escape and Falling Down." It 
is tracks such a these on which 
singer Bellamy teals the spot· 
light. Demonstrating his tremen-
dous range and vocal ability, Bel-
lamy proves himself to be capable 
of competing with the best in 
modern rock. 

The soul of Muse is not limited 
to the vocals. Chris Wolstenholme 
and Dominic Howard present an 
environment rich in both glam-
our and grit, artfully alternating 
between the two. 

ShowbIZ is a compilation of 
sounds from different rock genres. 
Yet, it is all so skillfully blended, 

that the result is something of an 
enigma, an undefinable sound that ' 
can be most closely associated with 
Radiohead. 

Muse is not widely known, 
but there are three things that 
should end this state. First, they 
are from England, and as we have 
seen with the Beatles, Spice Girls, 
and Oasis, Americans like Eng-
lish performers. Second, all three 
members of the band are gor-
geous, which never hurts, espe-
cially in a country whose con-
sumer music market is currently 
dominated by young girls. Third, 
they have talent. And while tal-
ented bands have been skipped 
over before, Muse has a huge hit 
for a debut album and the charis-
ma to carry their name into main-
stream.

*** There's no need to check the 
CD player when you first pop in 
folk sollgs for IralllS, trt,~- mId hOlley. 
The distortion, skips, and static 
sounds are all part of the album's 
"urban jungle" theme. And yes, 
there are a surplus of struggling 
urbanite musicians trying to cap-
ture the "essence" of their city. 
But, Savath+Savalas' folk songs 
does seem to offer something 
unique to a musical genre 
plagued with repetition and so-

called DJs. 
Savath+Savalas is a character 

created by Scott Herren. Alter egos 
seem to be the latest fad in the 
music industry. Not only is 
Savath+Savalas an alter ego to the 
artist, but the album plays counter-
point to another electronic project 
by Herren named Delarosa+Asora. 
But let's not get into the psycho-
babble of why he's fascinated with 
multiple personalities. Aside from 
the external comfleXities of folk 
songs, the overal groove of the 
album is subdued and quite relax-
ing. Although the first track, 
"beginning," betrays this descrip-
tion with its high-pitched crackles 
and off-beat skips, the following 
tracks resolve into a smooth and 
soulful beat. 

The progressive rhythm also 
exhibits hints of R&B and hip-hop 
seen exquisitely in "F 
ride+blues." E<'Ich track has its 
own individual flare such as 
"journey homes'" ambient har-
mony and "binoculars'" multi-
layered breakbeats. Herren suc-
ces fully incorporates a spectrum 
of electronic genres to create his 
view of the urban landscape as 
both a turbulent and tranquil 
organi m. folk sollgs can be best 
identified with Mark Farina's 
Mlls/lroolll Jazz vO/ lImp: 1. But 
don't buy the CD on the assump-
tion you'll be gelling another vol-
ume to the Mllshroolll Jazz series. 
Farina's album involves a heavier 
hip-hop element and keeps a live-
lier beat. But both albums helve 
successfully mixed both static 
and lucid clements in order to 
create an urban mood and theme. 
All tracks on folk songs are per-
formed live (with the help of a 
desktop computer or two) and 
contain no vocals. The overall 
effect is a beautiful score of elec-
tronic bea ts speckled with chaotic 
interludes- just like the city.

The Film's Title Says It All 
Natalie Portman's peiformance in itnywhere But Here'saves the day, nearly 
By JEREMY GRAY 
Senior Staff Writer 

A revelation for all the single 
men out there: The perfect date 
movie does exist. Not to say that 
"Anywhere But Here" is a good 
film; in fact it is precisely the 
opposite. But where else can one 
satisfy a fixation for wall-sized 
images of the enchanting Natalie 
Portman sa ns face paint? Sadly, 
this is the only game in town. 

Portman - who was the rea-
son men collected Diet Pepsi cans 
this summer - plays Ann 
August, a grounded 14-year-old 
who wants to find her identity 
and eventually break free of her 
good-intentioned but spaced-out 
mother Adele (Susan Sarandon). 
Moving from a comfortable life in 
the small town of Bay City, ,Wis., 
Ann and Adele head west, as 
Adele thinks she has a teaching 
job waiting for her in posh Bever· 
Iy Hills. Reality comes crashing-
down and soon the pair is poor 
and unhappy. 

Ann wants to live a normal 
life, but that proves impossible 
considering her flighty mother, 
who when faced with tragedy 
would rather eat at a fancy 
French restaurant than deal with 
her plight head-on. Adele needs 
Ann; she has not figured out how 
to grow without her daughter by 
her side. Ann needs indepen-
dence, however; she has not fig-
ured out how to grow with her 
mother by her side. 

If Ann is 14 going on 30, Adele 
is 40 going on 12.

acter has all the finesse of an 
open-heart surgeon with arthritis. 
She tells lies about her life to feel 
important among the snooty Bev-
erly Hills crowd, she sings to hide 
her lack of common sense and she 
heads to the ice cream parlor 
when life gets tough. What she 
doesn't do is summon any sym-

pathy. Instead, the audience 
wants to see Ann break free from 
her mother as soon as possible, 
which unfortunately takes close 
to two hours to happen. 

The frustration with the film 
lies in the fact that any real 
human being would quickfy real-
ize that life is not a snow globe to 

be shaken when one wants 
weather. So why is it so hard for 
Adele to come to this realiza tion? 

Because if she did, there 
wouldn' t be a movie.

DOGMA: 
Good and Evil duke 
it out in New Jersey 
c ................ . 
clear that writer and director 
Kevin Smith has once again 
struck gold. 

It is the fantastic and distin-
guished cast of comedians and 
actors that solidify the film's suc-
cess. Affleck and Damon play 
complex villains who dance 
across the line of right and wro~ 
as they repeatedly inflict God's 
wrath upon thP. !ICUJII they 
encounter in their path. 

Fioft!f\tino, Mewes and Smith 
. a bizane yet humorousl ~t trio of saviors. = 

Fiorentino occasionally seems out of 
her element while playing against 
these immature goofball characters, 
she brinW' a serious quality to the 
film that proves to be vital 

Rock. Hayek and Rickman 
have wonderful supporting roles 
that seem to be written specificaUr. 
for them. Rock's role doesn t 
require him to be funny at every 
moment, which allows him to give 
a unique performance. Mean-
while, Hayek brinW' a powerful 

ILLUSION: 
Michelle Anne 
Johnson shines 
CwI •• d".. ... l0 
stealing every scene he swooshes 
into. His penchant for women 
despite his personally recognized 
homeliness makes him the target 
of ridicule, but his tenacity to be a 
womanizer is as noble a quest as 
reaching the moon he so desires 
to hold. 

The other bright spot of this 
nine-person cast is Michelle Anne 
Johnson, who plays the role of the 
horny maid Elicia. Summoning a 
wide breadth of emotions and 
charm, Johnson leaves the audi-
ence hanging on every word. She 

POKEMON:

bringing home to mother, the bat-
tles are downplayed for plot's 
sake. Not necessarily a bad deci-
sion, but it might tum away the 
blood-lust crowd. 

The bad puns, however, are 
plenty: "I didn't think Vikings 
existed anymore!" says Brock. 
"They mostly live in Minnesota," 
Ash replies. 

You have been warned. 
In the animation department, 

"Pokemon" holds its own. Sure, 
it's no "Princess Mononoke," but 
the artwork is respectable. Blues 
radiate off MewTwo's attacks, 
and lines are crisp and bright. It is 
a welcome departure from the 
adolescent animation cranked out 
by the television factory. 

Bottom line: You don't have to 
love "Pokemon." But chances are 
you will be unwillingly dragged 
to the film by a younger sibling or 
an obsessive friend, so just 
remember that things could be

and refreshing sense of femininity 
to the male-dominated cast. 

Lee's character is probably the 
1east interesting in the film, and it's 
unfortunate that he doesn't get 
more of an opportunity to shine. 
Also, his cNracter comprises a large 
portion of the over-the-top violence 
(to which Affleck and Damon also 
contribute) that the film portrays 
rather 1oosel~ many instances it's 
difficult to' the significance 
of all the deaths and why they are 
bema g10saed over. 

Nevertheless, from the stand-
point of a long-time admirer of 
Smith's work and evolution as a 
writer and director, "Dogma" is a 
brilliant and extremely funny 
piece of work. For those not famil-
iar with Smith's style or sense of 
humor (or those particularly sen-
sitive about their faith) this film 
will no doubt cause a stir. 

In fact, the movie has already 
been held up in its release by stu-
dio executives wary about the 
film's frankness and undeniably 
controversial attitudes toward 
commonly held beliefs. But as the 
film's disclaimer points out, even 
God has a sense of humor ....ijust 
look at the platypus. 

Dogma opens this Friday in 
theaters nationwide. 

breathes passion and greed, yet 
still manages to elicit some sym-
pathy. 

Even when occasional scenes 
urge the actors to chomp and 
gnaw at the set, the play's satiSfy-
ing. twisted conclusion allows the 
audience to forgive moments of 
overacting. To spoil such an 
entertaining ending would ruin 
the overall immersion, but it is 
safe to say that for all the gusto 
and theater cliche, "The Illusion" 
will alter your perspective on the 
way you view life, love and the-
ater. 

"The Illusion" is currently 
playing at San Diego Repertory 
Theatre and runs through Nov. 
28. For tickets, call the Rep's box 
office at the Lyceum Theatre in 
Horton Plaza at 544-1000. 

worse. Besides the messages that 
are forced down the audience's 
throat - love thy neighbor, never 
tum your back on a friend, "We 
Are The World" - "Pokemon" is 
an entertaining way to spend 70 
minutes that just might appeal to 
your child within and your love 
of Japanese animation. 

Okar,. it's doubtful. At least it 
isn't 'Elmo in Grouchland," 
right? 

If you do decide to go, expect 
to feel out of the loop. Every time 
Pokemon characters appear on 
the screen, you can bet you will 
hear hundreds of children calling 
out their names as if the creatures 
can't remember them on their 
own (it's the only word they can 
say, people!). Some fans will 
dress up as Ash, Brock and Misty, 
and trading cards will fly around 
the theater faster than chicken 
pox. 

But, in a world full of com-
plexity, "Pokemon" stresses sim-
plicity: commWlication over con-
frontation, friendship despite 
physical differences and loyalty 
to the ones you love. When you 
get to the heart of things, thars all 
we really want anyway.

school (or any school for that 
matter), but director Wayne Wang 
begs us to look beyond this fact. 
He also begged us to accept his 
butchering of "The Joy Luck 
Club." Fat chance. 

Laugh, yell, cry, hug. Laugh, 
yell, cry, hug. Mix in the tradi-
tional sprinkling of personal 
tragedy and a finale at the airport 
and you have already seen the 
whole movie. 

The endeavor is almost saved 
by Portman's performance. 
Almost. Her deadpan delivery is 
perfectly timed; she says one 
thing while her eyes say another. 
She even lets the audience know

why she isn't throwing herself at 
Peter without actually saying 
anything. An accomplished tal-
ent, Portman's insightful perfor-
mance reserves her rightful spot 
in the Hollywood limelight. 

Maybe it was a sign. The blur-
ry projector, the sound flubs, the 
audience's howls during the dra-
matic scenes. Or maybe the tech-
nical problems were knowingly 
hiding spotty characters and an 
only average screenplay. Either 
way, when you sit down in the 
theater, just dick your heels and 
repeat after me: ' Anywhere but

1989, 1995, 1996 and 1997, while

UCSD's very own 
Super Sunday 

I realize that we are in the 
middle of sixth week. I also 
rea lize that because professors 
don' t understand that 
midterms should come in the 
middle of the term, many of us 
'are studying for next week's 
exams. Although these tests 
might be at the top of your "to-
do" list, I promise you, if there 
has ever been a weekend to get 
out and watch UCSD sports, it 
is this weekend. 

This could poSSibly be the 
greatest weekend in the histo-
ry of UCSD athletics, with 
three teams active in the play-
offs and all of these teams 
playing at home. 

There is a little something 
for everybody this weekend_ 
• The men 's soccer team 
starts its playoff run on 
Saturday when it hosts the 
winner of the Colorado 
College/Trinity University 
(TX) game at 1:30 p.m_ 

The women's volleyball 
team starts its quest for a sec-
ond national championship in 
three years when it takes on 
the winner of the Bethel 
College (MN)/Pacific 
Lutheran University (WA) 
game on Friday. It would be 
hard to bet against the Tritons 
this year, as they have lost only 
two games all season. 

Think that's impressive ... 
the women's soccer team has 
only lost once all year and also 
provided the most dramatic 
sports moments of the season 
last weekend in its taking of 
the Western Regional 
Championship at RIMAC 
field . The women got some 
much-needed rest this week-
end after 248 minutes (yes, 
over 4 hours) of play last 
weekerld_ 

It is almost sad that I even 
have to pump this weekend 
up. Events like this really 
should be their own advertis-
ing, but since that doesn't 
always work, I am resorting to 
shameless groveling for fan 
support. 

These are big events_ I know 
somewhere under that facade 
of a study addict lurks a little 
Triton pride in all of us. 1 see it 
creep out from time to time. It 
was there last year when we 
broke the RIMAC attendance 
record and allowed Dave 
Dillon to stop living on the roof 
of the gymnaSium. I see it 
every Sun God festival when 
all UCSD Tritons walk around 
with their heads held high 
because, at least for that day, 
they can be proud of the social 
climate of this university. 

Let's bring out that attitude 
this weekend and cheer the 
Triton teams to victory. Who 
knows, maybe a positive 
showing this weekend could 
lead to a widespread epidemic 
of social activity throughout 
campus. 1 hear all of us yearn-
ing for it, so here is our shot to 
do something to make this 
happen. Every good thing has 
to have a beginning, so help 
make this weekend UCSD's 
genesis of fun. 

Fencing Thrusts to Victory 
TOUCIIE: Both men and women are dominant in meet with against UCLA, UCSB and USC 
By BILL BURGER 
Staff Writer 

As much as most of us would 
like to take a sword to certain 
people, society tells us that we 
cannot do so. The Triton fencing 
team gets to break this social rule 
on a regular basis, however. 

The UCSD Men's and 
Women's Fencing teams were 
back sword-fighting again this 
weekend with a meet on 
Saturday against the University 
of Southern California, UC Los 
Angeles and UC Santa Barbara. 

Both the men's and women's 
teams performed well, winning 
in at least two weapon divisions 
in each match_ 

The women's epee team was a 
force to be reckoned with, win-
ning against all three opponents_ 
The squad was led by Hannah 
Griffith, who won every match 
she fenced that day. Julia Kulla-
Mader and May tal Dahan also 
had strong performances and 
added to the depth of the squad. 

"Our women's epee squad 
looks like they are likely to domi-
nate the conference again," Head 
Coach Stuart Lee said. "I feel 
good knowing I can count on this 
squad to anchor the women's 
team _" 

The women's foil squad 
defeated UCSB and UCLA but fell 
to use. 

"Women's foil is gaining some 
muscle," Lee said. "Jo Roberts had 
a very solid day and Jessica Fripp 
is beginning to mature as a com-
petitor." Indeed Roberts did have 
a good day, losing only one bout. 

At sabre, the women had an 
easy time against UCSB and use, 
but were defeated by UCLA _ 
Jessica Spuehler was the star of 
the day, winning two of her three 
bouts. 

"Jessica was sensational in her 
com~titive debut," Lee said. "[I 
willI look to her to anchor our 
women's squad in the future." 

Maggie Leunll/Guardian 
.,..._ UCSD fencing members Shawn Pfeil and Michael Davis-Allen practice for their next meet, 
taking place on November 20th against Cal State Fullerton and Cal Tech at UCSD. 

The men showed that depth 
was the strength of their team last 
weelcend, recording victories in all 
three weapon divisions against all 
three opponents-

The ~n's foil squad was 
dominant but Lee is look-
ins for some improve-
ment from this 
team in order 
to defeat its 
arch rivals in 
the upcoming 
meet. 

"I was pleased with the way 
the men fenced and held their 
composure in a few tight situa-
tions," Lee said. "They will have 
to step up their performance to 
beat Fullerton on the 20th." 

Wes Bellanca was the star of 
the squad, going undefeated on 
the day and recording four 5-0 
wins. 

The men's epee squad was 
led by freshman Shawn 
Pfeil. Pfeil lost only one 

fight on the 
day and won 

a 11 his other 
matches by deci-

sive margins. 
"As a freshman, [Pfeil] is 

a real contender for the 
national championships in the 
next three years," Lee said 

Epeeists Craig Johnson and 
Mike Davis-Allen also had good 
days, each going 6-3 during the 
meet. 

Lee was happy with the depth 
displayed by this squad and said 
he expects more in the future 
from these athletes. 

At sabre, depth again made 
the difference in the Triton victo-
ries. Tedd Padgitt had a good per-
formance, going 8-1 for the meet. 
Andrew Anfora recorded key vic-
tories against use and UCLA 
that helped seal the UCSD victo-
ries and Eugene Lee also fenced 
well in his first collegiate meet. 

UCSD hopes to parlay these 
impressive victories into a win 
against arch rivals Cal State 
Fullerton at home on Nov. 20. The 
Tritons will also be taking on 
California Institute of Technology 
that day. 

Soccer Playoffs Heat Up This Weekend 
DESnNY: The men start their playoff journey while the women are striving for the Final Four 
By ROBERT AlLrON 
Staff Writer 

UCSD soccer is dominating in 
all ways, with both the women's 
and men's teams making the 
postseason. 

The men are back in the show 
after missing the playoffs last year. 

Despite the year off, the post-
season is no uncharted territory 
for the Tritons. This is their 15th 
appearance in the playoffs, while 
they also brought home NCAA 
championships in 1988, 1991 and 
1993. The Tritons have also had 
26 p'!!st-season victories. 

'We always expect to be in the 
playoffs," Head Coach Derek 
Armstrong said. "We are disap-
pointed when we don't make 
them." 

Despite the past UCSD pow-
erhouses, the last few years 
have been less spectacular. 

Before missing the playoffs 
last year, the Tritons lost to 
Chapman 1-0 in the 1995 regional 
final, fell to Luther College of 
Iowa in the 1996 regional semifi-
nall-o and lost to Claremont 1-0 
in the first round of the 1997 play-

offs. 
"We don't worry about what 

happened two or three xears 
ago," Armstrong said. 'Each 
[loss] has a story. If you are not 
deep on the team, you have days 
like that" 

The Tritons look strong com-
ing into this postseason, with a 
12-4-2 record_ . 

"Our results were so good 
against Division 1lI teams," 
Armstrong said in reference 
to his team's 7-1 record 
against Division III 
opponents and vic-
tories against 
Chapman (5-1) and 
Claremont (3-0). 
"We defeated the impor-
tant people with pretty good 
results." 

The Tritons also had a tough 
schedule down the stretch. which 
they came out of fairly unscathed. 

"That game at Cal State San 
Bernadino was a killer," 
Annstrong said, referring to his 
team's 1-0 victory against the 
Division 11 opponent in the final 
§ame of the regular season. 
Sometimes a tough schedule 

helps you out." This win likely 
put UCSD into the toumam~nt. 

However UCSD is nursing a 
few injuries, namely to Jamie 
Lutton and Derek Orchard. 
Despite the injuries, Armstrong is 
confident in his team. 

"With this team, it is difficult 
to say," Armstrong said. "You 
need to be deep in talent. If you 
have a good day, you can play 
with anybody. It's all about 

momentum and who man-
ages their school sched-

ules the best" 
The-Tritons begin 

postseason play on 
Saturday at 1:30 
p.m., when they 

face the winner of the 
Colorado College 
University match. 

Saturday at 11 a.m., 
Washington's University of 
Puget Sound takes on the winner 
of the first round of the Chapman 
University /Claremont 
University match_ The winner of 
this match will play the winner of 
UCSD's game in the in the 
regional championship match. 
The regional final is Sunday at 5 

p.m. 
"We're going into a different 

season," Armstrong said. "We're 
as good as anybo~y. If we can get 
through this weekend, then I 
think we can get to the finals. " 

Despite the obvious successes 
of the men's team, it have a long 
way to go to match what the 
women have done so far this 
year. 

With an overall record of 16-1-
2, the UCSD women's soccer 
team was rewarded with home-
field advantage in the NCAA 
Division III Quarterfinals, to be 
held at RIMAC on Sunday at 12 
p.m. 

The Tritons, who were ranked 
No_ 5 in the final, regular-season, 
national coaches poll, had to sur-
vive a grueling weekend to reach 
this point. 

It took two overtimes and a 
sudden-death shoot-out for 
UCSD to defeat Cal Lutheran in 
the regional semifinals on 
Saturday. Then the Tritons turned 
around and downed Puget Sound 
1-0, but not after an epic triple-
