lood Discusses 
netnam Policy 
Professor Harold Rood of the 
!partment of Political Science 

Claremont Men's College 
oke here Wednesday night on 
lmerican Policy in Vietnam". 
• reveal his own prejudice be-
re starting, Rood said that he 
lS born by accident in the United 

~tes, but he discovered he liked 
and decided to stay. 
Professor Rood's contention 
s that our participation in the 
lr in Vietnam is a consistent 
tension of U.S. foreign poltcy 
nce World War II. American 
licy has been to prevent direct 
tack on the United States. To · 
lt effect we have troops in 
'veral distant areas of the 
• rld. For instance, we have 
on!,'" in Europe because it is in 
r interest to have them there. 
this respect U.S. foreign policy 
no different than that of any 

her country, i.e., to aid itsown 
terests. Professor Rood COIJ... 
ded that we may not always be 
e "good guys" but he hoped 
it we often would be. 
In fighting a guerrilla war, 
)od said, there are two strate-
es the guerrilla can use to 
gnificantly help his cause. First 
e guerrilla can try to make 
e enemy troops doubt the just-
ss of the war and the possi-
tHy of defeating the enemy with 
nventional forces. But in the 
ce of the assurance of the 
nerican troops and their tre-
endous fire power, the guer-
lIas can try to convince the 
,ople at home of the inhumanity 

the war, "that the techno-
~ical superiority of their troops 
somehow unfair and immoral", 
en convince them olthe unjust-
ss of the war. 
"Successful defens~ of South 
etnam is important to the 
ited States,'" said Rood, 
lerwise South Vietnam would be 
!ependent at the pleasure of 
tina." The Chinese could pro-
bly overthrow the other South 
.st Asian countries from the 

~ide through subsidies to Na-
lnal Liberation Fronts. 
?rofessor Rood maintained 
It this area is of strategic im-
rtance to the U.S. to prevent 
I threat of direc,t a,ttack en the 

U.S. The consequence of e l1mina-
tion of U.S. influence in South 
East Asia would be danger to 
other U.S. allies in the Pacific. 
The Chinese would be in a posi-
tion similar to Japan's before 
World War II. Professor Rood 
asked whether other nations who 
now depend on us for protection 
would trust us if we abandoned 
South Vietnam. 

These other nations, in order 
to accommodate the stronger in-
fluence of China, might ask us to 
leave our overseas bases which 
are on their territory. Then our 
only solution to other outbreaks 
would be some form of nuclear 
strike from distant bases . 

Success in South Vietnam, said 
Rood, may possibly make a stable 
country there and also help main-
tain our defensive perimeter in 
case of war with China. The situa-
tion then resolves into a question 
of staying in South Vietnam to 
deter China's ambitions or to 
withdraw and face the possibility 
of later fighting a war with a 
much stronger Red China and 
the probability of a direct attack 
on the United States. 

The latter condition, Rood said, 
is definitely not in the interests 
of the United States, which are 
to make the area stable to pre-
vent a general war which could 
involve a direct attack on the U.S. 
mainland. 

Following his lecture , Pro-
fessor Rood was repeatedly asked 
what he meant by "U .S. in-
terests". He added, in explana-
tion to his earlier remarks, any 
area the United States has in-
terests in including missionaries 
in Africa and Standard Oil in-
vestments abroad. 

Rood was then accused of say-
ing that it was permissable for 
the U.S. to violate international 
accords in pursuit of its in-
terests", specifically the Geneva 
Agreement. Rood, however, 
pointed out that neither the U.S. 
Government or the Government 
of South Vietnam had ratified 
the treaty, hence could not vio-
late it. He was also accused of 
complicity in violating the U.S.

Regents 
with 3 

Faced 
Choices 

Three • proposals were pre-
sented to the Regents at last 
week's meeting, each of which 
provides alternate methods of 
cViiecting funds through a stu-
dent charge. 

In what came as a surprise 
move to some Regents, Assem-
blymen Monagan and Comer re-
quested to be heard by the board. 
A report by the Special Commit-
tee on Student charges, appointed 
by the Board itseif, was on the 
agenda and the Regents were ex-
pected to act. on its proposal. 

Discussion followed as to what 
procedure should be followed. A 
motion was introduced to hear the 
two reports and then defer de-
cision on the matter until next 
month's meeting. In light of the 
controversial nature of this mo-
tion, one Regent called for a roll 
call. In the close balloting that 
followed, the ayes had it unani-
mously. 

Assemblyman Monagan then 
presented his plan, which he 
called the "graduated student 
charge plan." This plan, he said, 
was the result of several months 
of exhaustive study and research 
by members of the Assembly 
staff. "I hope that you will view it 
as nothing more or less than an 
honest attempt to help solve fi-
nancial problems," he said. 

The plan itself provided for a 
graduated increase in student 
fees based upon the gross in-
come of the student's family. 

~nagan claimed that his plan 
would require "those who bene-
fit to shoulder an increased cost 
burden based largely on their 
ability to pay." 

Assemblyman Collier followed 
with his "learn, earn, and re-
imburse" plan. By this plan, a 
student would sign a legally bind-
ing promisary note when he en-
tered college. He would then re-Me Pump House 

To be Rennovated 
Muir students' plea for a rec-

reation center and a "place to 
go" is bemg answered; a place 
has been found. 

The Pump HOUSl. formerly 
Bldg. 610 MC, has ~en selectea 
by the ... Governmental Space and 
Student Center Committee with 
the cooperation of Mr. Gilkey 
and Dean Batchelder, as a tem-
porary recreation center until the 
permanent center is built. 

In December the students pre-
sented the Provost's office with 
a petition signed by 133 Muirians 
asking for a temporary center. 
After much searching, 610 was 
settled on because of its size and 
low renovation cost. The build-
ing consists of a simple wooden 
frame structure, approximately 
26 by 36 feet atop a concrete 
lower floor. The college is 
making arrangements for repair 
of the roof and wooden floor: 
'iealing the walls replacing the 
windows and instalUng electrical 
wiring. The concrete lower 
floor will require extensive re-
novation, because it is divided 
into six compartments, each 6 
by 20 feet in size. The feasi-
bility of removing all or part 
of each of the partitions and of 
the north wall is now being de-
termined. 

The building will be released 
to the students to develop as they 
wish atter the renovating has 
been completed. Making 610 
usefut will require student paint-
tn.,: and construction parties and 

many ideas con cerning interior 
and exterior design, furniture 
ana possible uses of the rooms. 

Later when the permanent rec-
reatior. c~i1ter opens, 610 will 
be used as an auxiliary building 
to it. The building was origin-
ally a house full of pumps, hence 
the clever title "Pump House" 
was selected tentatively. 

Elsewhere in Matthew a pool, 
left over from Marine days, has 
been renovated. According to 
Rene Long, a sun disk or sunken 
patio area could be built into 
the hole. 

"Even a badminton court could 
be constructed,' Miss Long said.

nor Reagan's Health and Wel-

ceive hfs education free. How-
ever, when he reached a certain 
income bracket after graduation, 
he would pay back the university 
in full. If after 20 years he had 
still not reached this level, he 
would be written off "as a bad 
investment by both parties." 

Col\1er said that he would in-
troduce a bill in the Legislature 
with the Regents' approval. Since 
it would require a reforming of 
the entire tax structure, the bill 
would involve a constitutional 
amendment; it would be neces-
sary for the people to approve 
it by referendum vote. 

Finally, Regent De Witt Higgs 
of San Diego presented the pro-
posal of his committee. As the 
newspapers had reported a week 
before, the proposal provided for 
an across- the-board increase of 
$156 per academic year, with 
the name being changed to a 
"Univer sity Registration Fee." 
Although the allocation of the 
extra funds would remain flexi-
ble, most of it would provide 
additional student aid and help 
offset the cost of certain student 
programs. 

Most of the discussion that 
followed concerned not anyone 
particular plan, but the idea of 
raising fees in general. Assembly 
Speaker Jesse Unruh askea. 
"didn't we decide not to have 
tuition at our August meeting?" 
Regent Pauley then responded by 
saying that he didn't consider 
such a fee raise as tuition, to 
which Unruh replied, "that's an 
illusion, Pauley." 

The consensus of opinion a-
mong those opposed to the fees 
raise was that traditionally the 
incidental fee was charged for 
services rendered, services that 
would benefit the person involved, 
such as student health centers 
and counseling. Many Regents felt 
that some of the uses intended 
for the additional money would 
violate this principle. Regent 
Dutton, ~in particular, was afraid 
that once this "tuition" had been 
instated, it would be expanded 
each year. He favored some type 
of 5 or 10 year clause .

Why Not 
Galbraith Library 

With just a few months left before construction of the new Centr~ 
University Library begins it is almost obnoxious to have such an im-
posing addition to the UCSD campus saddled with such a colorless 
title so utterly devoid of any euphony or character. While the worth 
of the library will certainly not be all in its name, its merit should 
be reflected in the title which it bears. 

lndeed, we are in bad need of a name, and the Triton Tim~s suggests 
that UCSD's new library could assume the surname of John S. Galbraith, 
not as a stipend but as an expression of thanks for this man's unyield-
ing determination to keep this library on the drawing boards and in 
the budget. 

From the time of his inauguration as Chancellor of UCSD, Dr. 
Galbraith has made no bones about the necessity of a superlative 
research library to be located right on the campus of UCSD. This 
was diametrically opposed to the original plan of having fine research 
libraries located at Berkeley and UC LA with those of the other seven 
Universities acting only as satellite libraries. It is easy to imagine 
how it must have crossed the newly elected Chancellor's mind that 
UCSD, the showcase of the University of Calitornia, should have to 
include a bit extra in each proCessor's salary to pay for the bus fare 
to the UCLA Library. 

As early as 1964, Galbraith saw that the only way to keep UCSD's 
academic proportions abreast of its building program was to create 
a library which would attract the great minds UCSD was and still is 
seeking. This conviction was so strong that it is rumored he resigned 
his post two years ago partly because the Regents of the University 
of California refused to include UCSD's research library in the master 
plan. Apparently as a result of this intercession, the money was allo-
cated and the word was "go". 

While some may not feel that the present Chancellor has earned the 
right to have his name inscribed on the cornerstone of the new campus 
library, no one can dispute that John Galbraith has risked his all to 
make this dream come true - perhaps it is the greatest dream this 
university will ever have. 

It's About Time! 
Last week the thinking community of UCSD exp'3rienced an in-

teresting phenomenon concerning its campus newspapers. With a 
puerile swipe of the lndicator pen, we were all enlightened as to the 
rather precarious position in which our newspaper should be finding 
itself. For the sake of realism and indeed for those who still question 
the idea of an "official" second campus newspaper the Triton Times 
feel s moved to present the facts in this editorial not as " ... points 
of view," but as realities which have gathered dust for the past six 
months until our other campus publication desired to dredge them up 
for effect(?) or was it the lack of editorial material? 

As an introductory thought, it should be reasonable to assume that 
one who engages in the sale of his product would seemingly try to tell 
of its good points rather than resort purely to a criticism of the 
other side. Apparently the other publication would have us believe 
that it has so few "good points" it feels compelled to have everyone 
else, including the student body, share in its destitution. Self-pity 
has never sold even a "used eraser" , let alone a campus newspaper. 

Not as an offensive action, but merely as :In answer to the fantastic 
cIaims made by the other publication the Triton Times offers the 
following comparison of fancy vs . fact (All statements are consistent 
with Dean Murphy's recollection oC events last Spring): 
Fancy Fact 

"The majority of the members 
of the Communications Board 
favored writing into the by-laws 
a provision that there could be 
only one newspaper ever at 
UCSD." 

". . .the Trident Times (sic) 
during the third quarter of last 
year requested permission to 
publish, and the Board voted to 
give them a chanCE pr ovisionally, 
to publish." 

" ... but they (Trihn Times)were 
not officially recosnized." 

" ... The Triton Times put oul 
one issue in the middle of the 
quarter, and the n fell into an 
exhausted silenc' ) for approxi-
mately five weekL , ." 

Dean Murphy himself was the only 
member of the Communications 
Board seeking the "one-news-
paper" clause In the by-laws. 
This measure was soundly de-
feated by the rest of the Board. 
How else could there have been 
the recognition of the Triton 
Times without this set of cir-
cumstance'>? 

No provisional printing status 
of any kind was ever voted by the 
Communications Board to the 
Triton Times or any other pub-

,11: 1UOII t,} which the Intiicahll;' 
may be reCerrl ng t'l (his instance. 
Upon satisfying the Board of its 
financial Integrity and the need 
for another newspaper. the Triton 
Times was formally and o£ficially 
:,ccogni7.ed in April. 

The first Issue or the Triton 
Times was available to the stu-
dents on May 26, 1967, tina) 
exams began ten days later. 

While a slougt of such fictions yet remains we are bound to this 
abridged defense by our conviction that of all journalistic sins perhaps 
pedestrianis m is the most deadly. The Triton Times apologizes for 
departing from its usual policy, but we descend to thi s level for the 
sake of those who continually read the other publication and are un-
aware of the character of this "campus" newspaper which plagarizes 
national publications unmercifully and even borrows arbltrarlly ma-
terial from its competitor - the Triton Times. 

There wUl be no continuation of this editorial, - the underlying 
truth is already clear. if the other publication wishes to continue 
its forlorn walling in its feeble campaign it will have to do so alone, 
on its own time, at its own expense. 

Letters to the.Edltor 
Editor,The Triton Times: 

On Tuesday the 16th,lastweek. i 
the Nobel Prizewinner, Dr .Bethe. 1 
was here on campus giving a 
lecture on lnterplanetary Energy. 
and because of his fame and 
reputation we experienced an 
overflow in the lecture hall 2722 
USB. Many science-oriented 
scholars from allover San Diego 
were eagerly making their way 
to see and llsten to him. But , 
unfortunately many of them were 
unable to get in because of the 
large crowd and the limited ca-
pacity of the room. 

Foreseeing future occasions 
like this that may repeat disap-
pointments for many people who, 
of course, include UCSD's own 
students as it happened last Tues- , 
day, I sincerely suggest to the 
administration the possibility of 
utilizing the instrumentations a- , 
vailable in the school, namely. 
the linguistic laboratory that pos-
sesses two T.V. cameras and two 
video recorders which not only 
will help to alleviate crowded 
condit ions (by providing close 
circuit T.V.), but also will con-
sequently give many students the 
advantage of reviewing the lec-
tures on the audio video tape 
recorders afterwards. 

Highly honored people like Dr. ' 
Bethe whom we may not be 

Editor, the Triton Times: 

After examining the "Indica-
tor 's" editorial on the subject, I 
see why a second newspaper was 
started. From its blatantly sloppy ' 
facts (e.g. "Trident Times" for , 

, "Triton Times") to its even 
s loppier appearance, it seems an 
exercise in apathy. 

Concerning the rest of the 
issue, a newspaper which sup-
posedly serves the academic 
corn munlty is renigging In its 
duty when it devotes one-eighth 
of its available space to a mean-
ingless picture. 

And in the enti.e quarter, how 
regularly has the Indicator pub-
lished? Why should it complain 
about not being allowed to pub-
lish weekly when it is not able 
to publish bi-weekly? 

In I1ght of the above points, I 
suggest that the Indicator whould 
more appropriately be called the 
" Abdicator" • 

Sincerely yours, 
E. M. Myers

period of time ce$inly deserve 
to be recorded and treasured in 
the best possible way. 

I would like to see the admin-
istration consider my suggestion. 
Hopefully we can also see to 

Editor, the Triton Times: 
Certain students and faculty 

member(s) who showed up at 
the informal discussion wlthSen. 
Griffin on Jan. 12 have proved 
again how impossible it is for 
SIL-types to reason with anybody 
but people who agree with them. 

One would think that the pre-
sence of a United States Senator 
on campus would arouse , great 
interest among the student body 
in the workings of our demo-
cracy. One would expect such 
problems as the Negroes, urban 
congestion and even the difficul-
ties in solving the Vietnam war 
would spark students to inte1l1-
gent discussion with such an 
important person. 

Yet the dozen or so leftists who 
showed up at the Galathea Guest-
in Residence apartment could 
only carryon their incessant and 
unreasoned war of words against 

improve our interdepartmental 
cooperation, such as in the ex-
change of Instruments, to help 
exploit the well-equipped UCSD 
campus to its fullest . 

Earnestly yours, 
Sutton Chen 

the Senator. Question after ques-
tion, argument after argument 
was thrown at Griffin" without 
the sllghtest hint of respect for 
the office he holds or the s11ght-
est opportunity for him to answer 
their charges. One woman stu-
dent (?) said, "You're a United 
States Senator, man--can you dig 
it?" Come on, people--don't 
you realize whom you're talking 
to? Don't you realize that Sen-
ators are willing to carry back 
your complaints and solutions to 
Washington if you just show the 
least amount of courtesy? 

Unfortunately, this same old 
crowd of nuts will continue to 
e mbarass the rest of the stu-
dent body with their unabashed 
behavior. Perhaps some day, 
the rest of UCSD will assert 
itself and turn the spotlight away 
from these hypocriticalintellec-
tuals.

News 
Two brain systems appear to 

vie for control of our behavvor. 
It's almost as if there were 

two "buttons" - one marked fast 
and the other marked slow. Punch 
one button and our activities are 
speeded up. Punch the other and 
we are slowed down. 

Recent experiments at UCLA's 
Brain Research Institute have 
dramatically demonstrated this 
concept. Cats whose normal 
speed in getting to a food sour ce 
had been carefully determined 
were electrically stimulated in 
the two brain systems. When 
the "fast" system was stimulated 
the cat sped to the food source 
much more rapidly than normal. 
Stimulation of the "slow" system 
caused the cat to saunter to the 
food almost leisurely. 

The fast system was disco-
vered almost 20 years ago. This 
mechanism, sometimes called 
the "wakefulness center" and 
bearing the scientific name of 
the reticular activating system 
(RAS), was first described by 
Dr. H. W. Magoun, founder of 
the Brain Research Institute and 
now graduate dean at UCLA, 
and his co-workers. 

The other system is now coming 
into focus in a long-term re-
search program at UC LA's Brain 
Research lnstitute being con-
ducted by Drs.CarmineClemente. 
Maurice B. Sterman, David Fair-
child and their associates. 

Known technically as the basal 
forebrain inhibitory system, the 
mechanism apparently has an 
important role in the onset of 
sleep. Stimulation of this system 
not only appears capable of in-
ducing sleep but also of inhibiting 
many other body systems, in-
cluding spinal refiexes and pos-
sibly even ovulation. 

This research suggests that 
sleep is an active process. That 
is, we don't go to sleep because 
our wakefulness system is turned 
off, as has been thought by many. 
We slumber when our sleep sys-
tem Is turned on. 

Man will one day set up a 
permanent base on the moon be-
cause of human curiosity, its 
great scientific value, and to keep 
up the momentum of the space 
program. 

"We are not going to go to 
the moon and then turn around 
and come home," predicts Prof. 
Willard F. Ubby of UCLA. "We 

. will return repeatedly until we 
finally estabUsh a lunar colony." 

Dialogue 
to Begin 

Dialogue has been proclaimed 
as the true method of learning. 
Merely sitting in a lecture hall 
and absorbing what the professor 
tells you does not lead to an alert 
and questioning mind. This type 
of absorption enhance[; the de-
velopment ot an elaborate mimi-
cry of all that the ears have 
heard without experiencing self-

.. discovery. 
Self-discovery, persay, comes 

from the exchange ofideas.ideas 
which are bantered about tor and 
against, leave the mina in a state 
of inquiry. This inquiry leads to 
the development of new ideas 
which are discovered within the 
individual. 

The Triton Times would like 
to challenge Its readers to think, 
to discuss, to banter, and to 
develop new ideas . Each issue 
the staff will invite two scholars 
to discuss a given Issue. If you 
are aroused by the views pre-
sented please leel free to share 
your ideas with the students and

From " Cal 
The scientific and technologi-

cal payoff of a moon base is 
unpredictable, but judged by past 
space efforts the base will many 
times repay its investment. he 
belleves. 

Dr. Libby, the 1960 Nobel 
Prizewinner in Chemistry,isDi-
rector of the University ofCal!!-
ornia's Institute of Geophysics 
and Planetary Physics. Astron-
omers will be the first major 
beneficiaries of a base on the 
moon, free of the obscuring earth 
atmosphere. 

"A moon observatory will 
make a new science of astron-
only," says the UCLA chemist. 
"Earth-bound astronomers so 
far have been looking at the 
stars as from the botton I of a 
3D-foot swimming pool. Using 
telescopes on the moon, they will, 
in effect, corne to the surface and 
see clearly for the first time." 

By probing chemical reactions 
in the air less vacuum of a moon 
laboratory, chemists might come 
up with new materials or cheaply 
reproduce rare earth products. 

lf the moon contains lifelike 

organic matter, and Dr. Libby 
be Lieves it does, sCientlsts could 
take some giant steps in undet-
standing the origin of our atmos-
phere and possibly how and when 
life began on earth. 

"If we develop the ab111ty to 
live on the moon, we would be 
far along toward development of 
hardware necessary for the ex-
ploration of the rest of the solar 
system," Dr. Libby adds. "Con-
versely, It we don't 'establish a 
base on the moon, man, in a 
real sense, is likely to remain 
earthbound.' ,

says that gonorrhea causes a 
severe eye infection "which in 
the past, was a major cause of 
blindness in infiUlts."

Rege"ts Announce fee Increases 
The purposu of this plan is to raise revenue equitably for improved 

support of h1~her education at the University and State Colleges of 
California by requiring those who benefit to shoulder an increased 
cost burden based largely on their ability to pay. The Intent of this 
plan is to make an estimated $25 to $30 million lo added revenue 
available for student aid, facuIty enrichment, capital Outlay, educational 
innovation, counseling services or other uses as determloed by the 
Regents of the Univer sity and Trustees of the State Colleges. 

expenditures from this new revenue source, budgeted by the Regents 
and the Trustees, can be specifically determined. 

The ten key elements of the plan are: 

(5) There is no differential in fee increase between the University 
and the State Colleges. 
(6) Administrative costs of this plan would be negligible in relation 
to the revenue produced. 

(1) A reasonable $30 per academic year fee Increase ($10 per quarter 
or $15 per semester ) for all stUdents. 

(7) This plan largely eliminates taking money in fees from one pocket 
of a poor student and giving it back to him in another pocket In the form 
of a grant or scholarship simply to offset a significant across-the-
board fee increase. 
(8) It does not impose an added burden on the $7,500 to $10,000 middle 
income group identified by the Joint Committee on Higher Education 
as having too high an income for special poverty grants and scholar-
ships but too low an income to adequately finance higher education. 
(9) It equalizes educational opportunity by providing funds for con-
struction of needed facilities so that "marginal students," often from 
low-locome or minority group families, will not be "squeezed out" 
by too high admission standards based on lack of space. 

(2) A fee Increase above $30 per year on a graduated basis for Cali-
fornia resident students whose family income is $10,000 or more. At 
$10,000 adjusted gross locome the total fee increase would be $55 
per year and at $50,000 adjusted gross income, $630 per year (the 
maximum fee increase). 

(3) An exemption for Vietnam War combat veterans who are California 
r sldents from any graduated fee Increase. 
(4) It places locome derived from this tee Increase into separate 
£ncome Funds at the University ~d the State Colleges so that proposed (10) It provides no graduated fee Increase for self-supporting students. 

A. S. Senate Notes 1'lIlrAI SIIIJRI 11111111 fllIlIIEI 
by Roger Showley 

The Senate finally got down to basic problems in UCSD student 
government at its meeting last week. With the Deans of Students 
from Revelle and Muir--Hull and Batchelder respectively--and three 
students from Muir present, the role of the AS in terms of the col-
leges could be discussed. 

Dean Batchelder gave the most realistic appraisal of the situa-
tion, when he declared that " there is a basic inconsistency (in AS 
Senate operations) which is becoming Increasingly embarassing." 
He resented the apparent unconcern among the Senators for Mulr's 
problems and the fact that the Senate appropriated funds so freely 
for functions in Revelle, but categorically r efuses to give money 
to the second college. 

Rich AJtenhoff related again his fear that the AS would "become 
a funding organization that met at the beginning of the Fall Quarter 
gave out the money, and recessed until the Spring elections." 

The main problem in the whole matter is what r ole should the col-
leges play in providing services and ente rtainment for their respec-
tive students? Dean Hull said funds could be raised by separate 
college fees , AS fees appropriated to the colleges, or college fees 
appropriated, in part, to the AS. 

A current problem, however, overshadows even this basic phil-
osophical question: what is college government? How can AS-College 
re lationships be defined without the benefit of the existence of college 
government? Now that Muir exists, Revelle has to forge out on its 
own. Neither college has representation from both the commuters 
aIJd t~e residents . And neither has funds of its own. 

Once the elections are held next quarter, and Revelle loses its 
absolute control over Senate action, the AS will become a truly 
University-wide organization. It is simply unfortunate that Mulr 
could not be repr esented by its own elected senators this year. Ar-
ticle I, sec. 2:0 (2) of the AS constitution (1966) is to blame. 

Speaking about elections, Altenhoff made it official that new sen-
ators and prez. and v.p. will be elected on April 24 instead of some-
time this quarter. Although this is unconstitiona 1 (Articl<l V. Sec. l:B), 
he rationalized it by explaining that more people wou Id vote since 
Choice '68, sponsored by TIME magazine (to sample college students 
oreferences for US president) will be held at the same time. 

The Senate last week promised $700 to the Black Students Council 
to get Black Nationalist Dick Gregory on campus during Negro His-
tory Week at the beginning of February.

soon as possible by the halls 
or floors concerned. 

C. The thirteen elected mem-

istlcs of each hall (mens, 
womens, upper and lower 
divisions, etc.). 

B. Each committee will elect its 
own permanent chairman, 
who will be responsible for 
coordinating the activities of 
the committee with respect

they would be able to render 
a more meaningful decision. 

E. At the beginningofthe school 
year, and at other intervals

proper authorities must be 
substituted for Judicial 
Board Discipline. 

B. All cases brought before the 
Judicial Board must be re-
viewed by a Resident As-
sistant before they will be 
considered. Students may

the Judicial Board shall be 
by the students directly con-
cerned and, when necessary, 
by the administration .

King Arthur and his Knights sworn to uphold justice, seated' 
around the legendary Round Table. 

Camelot Is 
Land Revisited 

Came lot - the magic olthe word 
evokes images of a timeless 
dream of justice and peace that 
existed for one brief shining 
moment long ago. The eagerly 
awalted, well-cast, richly cos-
tumed and decorated film version 
of the Lerner-Loewe musical 
"Camelot" has preserved all of 
the soarlog magic of this dis-
tant hope. 

LiUlnevere and in their aduUerous 
fall from grace they violate the 
ideals Camelot was founded upon. 
Though Arthur resolve s that his 
love for them prec~l~es revenge, 
Morored's wicked plotting en-
sures a tragic end.

Duo Works In 
Enamel, Metal 

A joint exhibition of construc-
tions by prominent San Diego 
artists Jackson and Ellamarle 
Wooley opened Wednesday, Jan-
uary 24 at La Jolla Museum of 
Art. 

Included in the joint exhibition 
will be Jackson Wooley's painted 
constructions of polyester-coat-
ed wood and metal and Ellamarie 
WooLey's work with acrylic col-
ors on raw canvas. 

Mrs. Wooley has based her 
constructions on "Sun" and " So-
lar Day" motifs. Mr. Wooley's 
works are derived directly and 
indirectly from details observed 
around the San Diego waterfront. 

Jackson and Ellamarie Wooley 
have been engaged in full time 
enamel and copper work since 
1947. Examples of their enamel 
design can be found in a number 
of Southern California buildings 
including the First National Bank 
·building and Civic Theatre, In 
downtown San Diego and the Bot-
tle 'N' Beef restaurant in Co-
ronado. 

Jackson Wooley Is a graduate 
of Carnegie Institute of Technol-
ogy and has exhiblted throughout 
the s tate. His work has been 
shown at the Stanford Research 
Institute, Museum of Contempo-
rary Craft s In New York and 
Orr 's gallery in San Diego. He 
Is a member oftheAlUedCralts-
men of San Diego and the Amer-
ican Craltsmen's Council ot New 
York. 

Jackson and Ellamarle Wooley 
will be in the galleries from 7 
to 10 p.m. on January 24. The 
exhibit continues through Feb-
ruary 25.

'68-'69 Scholarship 
Deadline Nears 

All continuing students in-
terested in applying for a scho-
larship for 1968-1969 are urged to 
obtain an application for financia l 
aid from the Financial Aids Office 
as soon as possible. Any appli-
cations received alter February 
15 wUl be considered in a later 
review only for any scholarships 
which may be declined. 

Since the scholarship applica-
tion and supporting documents 
necessary require time for pro-
cess ing, every effort should be 
made to submit them before the 
usual rush at the February 15 
deadline. 

The Committee on Undergra-
duate Scholarships and Honors 

- --- ----

will be reviewing applications the 
latter part of February and during 
the month of March. Scholar ship 
recipients will be notified be-
ginning approximately Apr il I 
and through the spring quarter. 

Once again, remember---it is 
vital that an application Cor scho-
lars hip and supporting documents 
be received in the Financial Aids 
Office by February 15 In order 
to be considered in the initial 
review. The Financial Aids staff 
is prepared to answer your ques-
tions. Fee I Cree to stop by Bldg. 
250, Camp Matthews, any day 
Monday through Fr iday, 8:30 -
12:00 and 1:00 - 4:30 for appli-
cations and infor mation. 

Unfortunately, the vast major-
ity of this country's film cri-
tics have not treated "Camelot" 
kindly. The film has been con-
sidered a very great disappoint-
ment which has notfully exploited 
the resources of the cinema to 
remove the pretentious patches 
of realism and romantic cliche 
that kept it from sparkling on 
stage. It has been considered as 
waverlog fatally between fantasy 
and reality, as moving In a slow, 
static pace with a ploched and 
artificial quality, and finally, 
thought 01 as lavishly overdone. 

PrOductlon ClesignerJ ohn Trus-
cott has done astounding things 
with the armor, the costumes, and 
some of the castle loteriors, all 
at fabulous expense. Drawing 
from fact and fancy his com-
mitment to detail has created the 
likes of Sir Sagramore's ornate 
jousting carapace and a steed 
armored as a "unicorn with sil-
ver feet." 

Ther e are a few unavoidable 
flaws, principally the incessant 
overuse of close-ups that un-
comfortably crowd the screen. 
Though visually magnificent, the 
fj) m is rather constricted and 
even the European exteriors deny 
us the feeling of all of Camelot 
and the spacious sense of Eng-
lands green and pleasant land. 
The great battle-scene when Lan-
celot and his men ride in to 
rescue Guloever from the stake 
is curiously abbreviated and 
seems to be somewhat of a con-
fusion in cramped quarters. 

Minors Program Opens 

Although a few of the se com-
plaints are justified and although 
"Camelot" has perhaps not quite 
reached the expected heights, 11 
still remalos a "bloody marvel-
ous" film. The elements of the 
King Arthur legend are indes-
tructible in their appeal. The 
film portrays this legend with a 
great deal of charm which llIoves 
one deeply. The lyrics are witty 
and inventive, and the melodies 
very beautiful Indeed, particul-
larly the title song and the two 
ballads "How Can You Handle 
a Woman?" and " U Ever IWould 
Leave You." The quality of the 
sound is sumptuous: stereo at 
Clnetama screen is overwhelm-
ing. 

Richard ' Harris is a very cap-
tivating figure as the eccentric 
boy-king and hopeful Idealist 
whose dreams of glory are solely 
for his land and his people. 
Vanessa Redgrave is elegant and 
breathtakiIigly beautlflJl as Gulo-
evere. Franco Nero as Lancelot 
is logenuous, handsome, and 
eager. but becomes somewhat of 
a romantic cliche. The extremely 
professional performances also 
include . David Hemmings who 
conveys the smirking evU of 
Arthur's lIlegiUmate son, Mor-
dred, and Lionel Jeffries as the 
comical Klog Pelllnore. 

The story centers around Ar-
thur's challenge to a corrupt 
world buried In violence. He 
creates a Round Table of Kn1(hts, 
charging them to uphold justice. 
His most vaUant and virtuous 
knJcbt, Lancelot, falls in love with 

What truly moves us is the 
tragedy of the three-way love 
affair which contains no hatred, 
and the shattered dream oC a 
just, peaceful Camelot. When 
Harris, as Arthur, in tears at 
dawn, insists all was not in vain 
if Camelot's brief shining mo-
ment be remembered, memories 
and dreams are stirred that are 
not Arthur's alone. Camelot has 
worked Its dazzling magic on 
us very successfully indeed. 

A new minor program in sci-
ence for non-science majors was 
announced recently 
by Reve lIe provost, Dr. Paul 
Salt man. The program will be 
des igned to accentuate the non-
contiguity of minors , and will 
consist of a series of science 
and math courses deallog with the 
most exciting courses under cur-
rent research. The professors 
wilI be top researchers in their 
fields and wlll include Dr. Ed-
ward Teller, commonly known 
as the Cather of the hydrogen 
bomb. Dr. Teller, who is a 
proCessor-at-large for the Uni-
ver sity of California, will conduct 
a course lo physiCS dealing with 
topics of relativity and quantum 
physics. 

The program grew out of con-
cern that non-science majors 
were not minoring in subjects 
that were non-contiguous. It is 
designed to encourage these stu-

Action 
The InterhalJ Council is cur-

rently completing work on sever-
al projects of vital interest to 
resident students. Next week will 
see a vote to amend the resi-
dent hall constitution. The 
amendment would provide lor a 
central Judicial Board whose 
function would be to handle stu-
dent disciplinary problems. This 
would relieve the Resident As-
sistants of most of their respon-
sibility, and give the students a 
chance to enforce the rules that 
govern them. 

Since this issue is so impor-
tant, the complete text of the 
proposed Judicial Board consti-
tution is printed here. All Resi-
dent students are urged to exer· 
cise their voting privileges in the 
upcoming election. The decision 
will be by a two-thirds majority. 

The mterhall Council is also 
finishing its proposal to change 
visitation rules. When completed, 
it will be submitted to COSA, the 
Committee on Student Affairs, 
which is composed of student, fa-
culty, and administration mem-
bers. The main changes concern 
in-room viSitation, main lounge 
hours, and curfew. 

At one of the recent meetings 
it was brought to light that the 
barbecue area near Beagle Hall 
is now available for use by any 
students. All that is necessary is 
for the intere sted party to re-
serve the area ahead of time at 
the Resident Dean's office. Fur-
niture has arrived, but help is 
needed to unload and assemble it. 

The result of last quarter's 
vote on resident activity fees 
was 237 for, 235 against. However 
there will be no fee during the up-
coming quarter unless, or until 
the council can determine the 
constitutionality of such a resi-
dent tax. 

Circle K and YR's 

Present 

Pol itical Spea kers 
Two politically controversial 

speakers arrive next week to 
brief students on the rigors of 
war and welfare. 

On Monday Circle K service 
club presents Lieut.-Cmdr. Wai-
ter F. Baker, who will give his 
"unique analysis" of "The oth-
er war in Vietnam". 

According to Tom Tucker, 
president of Circle K, Baker 
has had experience in the pac-
ification program in Vietnam 
and is now stationed in San Diego. 

On Tuesday Young Republicans 
present their second speaYer of 
the quartg r, Spencer Will ams, 
Gov. Reagan's Administrat Jr of 
Health and Welfare. He will 
give a lecture on the" Future 
of Medi-Cal". 

Wllliams is the Gover nor's 
chief advisor, and in eCIec , e)f-
ecullve director of 16 dep-
artments in the Health ar,1 el-
fare Agency, ranging froll the 
Departments of Youth Autlorlty 
to Industrial Relations . 

He was deeply involved ir Gov. 
Reagan's cutback in Medi-Cal 
benefits during 1967. 

Baker will speak in the Human-
ities Library Auditorium on Mon-
day, Jan. 29 at 8 p.m. 

Williams will speak in the South 
Dining Han at 3 p.m. on Tues-
day, Jan. 30. A short business 
meeting for YR members and 
other interested students, tacult} 
and staff w11I be he ld atter the 
speech.

Club Communique 
From now on the Triton Times will be presenting this column 

concerning the latest achievements and activities of the various 
organizations at UCSD. We, as a staff, hope that this column will be 
an informative as well as a refreshing pause in the reams of straight 
news copy. 

The next tew days have sometbing to offer for nearly everyon~ on 
campus. For those of you who may wish to spend a quiet week-end 
atter the bustle of the school week, the Trident Christian Fellowship 
has planned just the thing. Their annual retreat has been designed to 
give students a chance for personal meditation, group discussion and 
scriptural reading in the beautiful countryside surroundings of Il! lJJz 
near Fallbrook. For spice, the Fellowship has reserved an old two-
story home which was, at one time, a stage stop. 

If you're interested in a quiet week-end with an earnest purpose, the 
fee will be $10 for the two days with the group returning to campus at 
3 p.m. Sunday afternoon. Give Don l1Jncan, 631 Argo Hall, a call at 
453-0574 or Susie Rothbart at 453-3789 and they'll be happy to fit you 
into the schedule. 

Finishing up the week-end activities, the UCSD Surfboard Club will 
hit the surf on Sunday and pit its talent against our competitor down 
the coast, Cal-Western. This major tournament lor the water sport 
will pull UCSD into a three-way tie for first place or sink us to last 
place in the league. The Ocean Beach exhibition will be free and will 
begin at I o'clock . This may be our chance to gain face alter our defeat 
by the Cal-Western Basketball team last quarter. 

Monday will then open the doors to another week at the books, but 
there are things to ease the study pangs, even on the first school day 
of the week. The Circle K is putting it on for those who may want to 
'hear a somewhat different facet of the Vietnam struggle than is usually 
bandied about. This food for thought will come in the form of a speech 
by Lieutenant Commander Walter F. Baker. This rather impressive 
individual who served as the political and psychological warCare 
advisor to the Vietnamese Navy will make his presentation entitled 
"The Other War in Vietnam" at the H- L Auditorium at 8:00 pm on 
Monday evening. The talk will be concerned mainly with the U.S. 
PaCification Program and is absolutely free. 

Spearheading the February agenda will be the UCSD Ski Team in 
competition against a host of other big schools including UCLA, San 
Diego State, Cal State at L.A., the Claremont Colleges, UCSB and a 
slough oC other well-known names. The giant slalom will make the 
snow fly on the 4th oC February at June Mountain, very near Mammoth 
Mountain in northern California. 

It wUI cost each team $5.00 to show off its ski skill and with such 
kn entourage, ours better show off alot of it. 

If your club organization or drive is anxious to be included in this 
continuing column, please contact the Triton Times at ext. 1077 or 
leave a message and phone number at extension 1918. News Brief 
Forms will then be sent to you to be filled out before the publishing 
deadline for the remaining Winter quarter issues of the Times. 

UCSF Claims Success 
The fir st transplanted human 

kidneys which had been "kept 
alive" on a perfusion machine 
after removal .<1 t: :; 111 flpr-
forming successfully in three pa-
tients at the Univer sity of Calif-
ornia' s San Francisco Medical 
Center. 

The transplantations were car-
ried out by Dr. F. O. Belzer, 
assistant professor of surgery, 
and his associates. They also 
developed the perfusion machine 
on which one of the human kid-
neys was maintained for 17 hours. 

Animal kidneys have been 
"kept alive" for as long as 
72 hours and then transplanted 
successfully. 

The perfusion machine sup-

plies the kidney with human plas-
ma, fortUied with hormones and 
other substances, so that it con-
tinues to function as it would in 
the body whlIe the recipient is 
being surgically prepared (or the 
transplant. It also overcomes 
the problem of simUltaneous sur-
gery and the need for two sur-
gical teams. 

"Improved preservation tech-
niques," Dr. Belzer explained, 
"wlll permit transplantations to 
be elective rather than emer-
gency procedures. The additional 
time allows better matching of 
donor and reCipient. When tis-
sues of donor and reCipient prove 
compatible, transplants are prob-
ably as successful as between 
patients who are related." 

Guidance Seminars 
Planned 

"What shall I major in? How 
may I improve my attitudes and 
values toward study and college? 
What graduate school seems to 
offer me the best opportunity for 
growth? When it's time to se-
lect a position in my major field. 
atter graduaton, what position 
will be the most appropriate?" 

UCSD students who are pres-
ently attending the UCSD Place-
ment Center's January seminars 
are being helped to find the 
answers to these and many other 
questions. Perhaps you, too, 
would like to take advantage of 
this special service now being 
offered by the Career-Education-
al Planning and Placement Cen-
ter. 

The Center is planning a new 
series of seminars which will 
begin on Wednesday, Febrary 8, 
and on Thursday, February 9. 
There will be five meetings held 
in this series of seminars, which 
will meet once a week in the 
formal lounge at Revelle College 
from,4:00 to 4:40 p.m. Each 

seminar will be limited to fif-
teen students. 

Students who deSire to partici-
pate in these seminars beginning 
in February are urged to regis-
ter early with the Career-Edu-
cational Planning and Placement 
Center, 250 MC, Ext. 1941, or

Anti- fmperiafist 
Actions Favored 

A telegram was sent last Mon-
day to a Japanese student or-
ganization by members of the 
UCSD community to "congratu-
late you (the students) on your 
courageous and persistent antl-
imperialist actions in Sasebo and 
Tokyo." 

According to Dr. George 
Szanto, Assistant Protessor of 
German and Comparative Litera-
ture, the telegram was sent be-
cause of "general outrage by us 
at the pollce brutality telecast 
on television" following demon-
strations against the USS Enter-
prise, which was at port inJapan 
last week. 

Those sending the telegram in-
ciuded 84 students and 18 pro-
fessors, according to Szanto. 

"We also felt we had to do 
something because the · Enter-
prise is based in San Diego," 
he sa; • (According to the Ele-
venth Naval District in San Diego, 
however, the Enterprise isbased 
in Alameda, near San FranCisco.) 

Szanto said there has been "no 
official response" to the tele-
gram. The three professors re-

Constltutton and . supporting a 
genocidal war. In answer to the 
first charge, Rood noted that the 
President is Commander in Chief · 
. of the Armed Forces and a de-
claration of war is not needed to 
use these powers. Congress can 
declare war if it wants or it can 
deny funds to cut shortthe armed 
forces. 

As for the accusation of geno-
cide, Rood quoted figures sup-
pUed by North Vietnam to a Jap-
anese newspaper. In the first 6 
months of 1967 when the U.S. 
dropped more tons of bombs on 
North Vietnam than it did on Ger-
many during World War IT, North 
Vietnam reported 500 civilians 
killed. Rood then compared thiS . 
figure to the 50,000 Buddhists 
and Catholics Ho Chi Minh killed 
in a purge atter he gained control. 

Dr. Joseph Boskin, Professor of United States history at USC, is 
lecturing here on raCial, religious and educational issues of the day. 

When accused of supporting a 
barbarous and immoral war, 
Rood said that it depends onyour 
view point. The Israe lis think 
they fought a highly moral war 
against the Arabs, but the Arabs 
would disagree. As for the use 
of napalm, he said, "I deplore Boskin Speaks Out · On 

Ameri can Pol iti cal Scene 
The racial situation in Ameri-

ca? "Ghastlyl" exclaimed Dr. 
Boskin. A professor at USC, and 
a visiting professor at UCSD 
currently lecturing in History 36, 
Dr. Joseph Boskin is one of the 
foremost authorities on Ameri-
can social thought and history. 
His personality is reknown not 
only in the classroom but also in 
television. For his knowledge, 
popularity, and tremendous in-
terest Dr. Boskin was inter-
viewed by the Triton Times. 

"For 300 years," Dr. Boskin 
explained, "the racial problem 
has menaced American society 
and today it is almost too over-
whelming, it not entirely out of 
hand" 

Ac'cordIng to the USC pro-
fessor, the Negro must find his 
identity. He must find his place 
and role in society. but more 
than this - he must have it. "The 
Negro must rebel and resort to 
violence for he has no other al-
ternative by which to obtain the 
power he must have in order to 
command respect. The Negro 
must act - he must become a 
roaring lion. The time of plead-
ing and talking and praying is in 
the past." 

"If attaCked", stated Dr. Bos-
kin "the white man can't turn 
hiS' head, he will be forced to 
open his eyes and mind, he will 
have to face the Negro no longer 
as a Sambo, but a real person 
with power and infiuence." 

However, "The catastrophe a-
head," as Dr. Boskln foresaw, 
"is not the Negro riots, but the 
posslbll1ty that the whites wUI 
retaliate and it so, the riots 
might well turn into racial war." 

Turning to the contemporary 
college student, the professor 
stated: "The main characteristic 
of college students today is that 
they are so very active and this 
is very commendable . In the 
1930's college students were very 
ideological and they sought things 
on a long term basis in contrast 
to the students of today who act 
and then want immediate results. 
The students of the 40's and 50's 
were a mean between the ideo-

logical and the very active." 
In this latte r category, 0 r. Bos-
kin was a student. 

Concerning UCSD in particu-
iar the professor exclaimed "It 
is the students! They are highly 
enthusiastic, very active, most 
enjoyable, and very interesting. 
They are not afraid to talk, and 
the types of questions they ask 
are examples of this" • 

Evaluating the educational sys-
tem of today, Dr. Boskin em-
phasized two points "that should 
have significant importance": 

(1) The professor should be 
responsible primarily to stimu-
late his class and they should 
do the rest. 

(2) Competition should not 
mean students against students 
but rathe r, the student should 
compete against himseif. 

Assessing the constituents of a 
healthy society, Dr. Boskin hy-
pothesized "that it would be a 
state with a great and impelling 
diversity of peoples, opinions, 
and philosophies, and a society in 
which the people are keenly aware 
of this diversity, and in which tlus 
diversity is keenly active and 
constantly made manifest." 

Concluding, Dr. Boskin com-
mented on the popular belief that 
"God is Dead". 

"If a God does exist" Dr. Bos-
kin pointed out, "He cannot be 
dead, for this is a contradiction 
of terms." However, when the 
phrase "God is Dead" is used 
today, "It means that the view 
of God has changed in the minds 
of the people". 

"m today's society," empha-
sized Dr. Baskin, "God is apro-
duct of the mind of the people 
and not the people a product of 
God. As a result, morallty is 
whatever the people make it to 
be since it is based on the God 
whom the minds of the people 
have produced,"

Professor Kirkby tried to 
change the argument to one based 
on moramy. Professor Rood re-
fused to be drawn into a dis-
cussion of morality because, he 
said, there are no absolute moral 
standards to go by. 

Professor Rood was also asked 
his opinion of the War Crimes 
Trials in Germany atter World 

JANUARY 26, 1968 PAGt 7 

War n. Rood said he considered 
them a legal travesty imposed by 
the victors upon the defeated. 
This received scattered ap-
plause. , 

Once Professor Rood was 
caught of! guard when one of the 
more vocal leftists compiained 
that he used only "rational ar-
guments". Rood conceded that 
this was true. He then asked, 
"Would you rather I use an 
emotional one?" 

Katchen Recital Praised 
Julius Katchen, renowned pi-

anist, gave a recital in Sher-
wood Hall last Wednesday even-
ing, playing a concert including 
the works of Shubert, Beethoven, 
Debussy, and Moussorgsky. 

It was obvious that Moussorg-
sky' s Pictures at an Exhibition 
was one of his favorite works. 
It was executed with astounding 
brilliance of dynamics , although 
his technique failed in a few spots, 
primarily in his grasp of chords 
in the "Great Gate ot Kiev." 
However, it is very difficult to 
perform "The Great Gate" with-

The A.S. sponsored a dance 
last Sat. night that turned out 
fairly well. Attendance was up 
for usually apathetic dance at-
tenders of UCSD and The Care 
Package turned out to have a 
good beat and a large repertoire. 

Junior members of ASP were

out the final measures sounding 
anticlimactic, after establishing 
the many tortissimos which pre-
ceed it. By a s teadily rising 
crescendo, however, Katchen o-
vercame thi s problem. His use 
of the damper pedal for the darker 
shadings IIIe!'e particularly ef-
fective. 

The rest of the program wasn't 
nearly as exciting. The four 
Impromptus (part of Shubert's 
last group of piano solos) were 
rather hastily and s loppily done 
with poor control. (Katchen left 
his hotel five minutes before 
curtain-time and rushed on stage 
immediately upon arrival. Per-
haps this accounts for his poor 
start.) 

The Beethoven (C minor So-
nata, Opu Ill, No. 32).was hardly 
recognizable due to hiS constant 
overphrasing, although the last 
movement had many poignant mo-
ments; in general he portrayed 
faithfully the theme of elemental 
struggle which is so much a 
part of Beethoven. 

Somehow he missed the boat on 
Debussy' s "La Cathedrale En-
gloutie." The sunken Cathedral 
never rose above the surface in 
spiritual ecstasy, but instead re-
mained 10,000 fathoms under-
water. 

The Moussorgsky however was 
well worth all these sacrifices, 
which was evident when the audi-
ence called hi m back for three 
encores.

Tritons Look Ahead Sports Announcements 
UCSD's Tritons found them-

selves up against 3 different 
opponents in 5 nights this last 
week, dropping two in a row. 

Friday, Jan. 19 saw the Tri-
tons playing at home against La 
Verne. Neither team was es-
pecially accurate from the floor, 
with UCSD shooting 43% to La 
Verne's 41%. In fact, the two , 
teams seemed fairly evenly 
matched, though the Tritons held 
the edge, and ended up on top 
83-75. 

The following night, the cager s 
took on UC Rive r side, where 
their defense was sorely tested. 
There appeared to be a little 
more total team effort by UCSD, 
especially on defense. UCR had 
the locals down by 17 pOints at 
the half, but the squad narrowed 
that to 2 late in the game . 

The Achilles tendon ofthe Tri-
tons the whole season, i.e. their 
inability to keep the pace through 
the last minutes of the game, 
proved to hold true again. UCR 
triumphed 83-74. 

Billed as a battle of cross-town 
rivals, the game against Cal 
Western on Tuesday night saw 
the rivals beat the good guys 
93-76. 

Knowing that the fast start is a 
great morale booster, he Tri-
tons finally seemed to j 11 as 
they reeled off 11 powts right 
away, but it was aU Cal Western 
soon after, and the loca ls had to 
play catch-up ball. 

Executing their plays to per-
fection, and utilizing the fast 
break, the Westerner! caught 
the Tritons off guard a Id pretty 
much dominated the pia: . 

Some bright spots we re found, 
however. The past three games 
have seen much consi,tent ef-
fort on the part of various play-
ers, and it does appear that the 
team might be finding the co-
hesion needed to win. Steve Edney 
has looked good , especially on 
defense, and John Thomas has 
proved to be the man to provide 
the scoring punch. He's scored 
64 points in the last 3 games, and 
has been the s tandout ballplayer 
for the Tritons. 

The Tritons will have a tough 
battle starting tonight as they 
travel to Riverside for the UCR 
Classic Tourney. UCSO meets 
Davis in the first game tonight, 
and they mean to win this one. 
They lost to Davis last month in 
the opening round of the Christ-
mas tourney, and would like to 
avenge that defeat. 

With the defense looking better , 
they might do it, but the offense 
will have to become more con-
sistent. Hopefu lly, the Tritons 
can find the extra hustle to beat 
the Aggies, and come out on top 
to play in the final s on Saturday 
night. 

Wednesday evenings from 6:00 
to 9:00 are "Campus Recrea-
tion Nights" at UCSO. On these 
evenings all students, faculty, 
and staff are invited to utilize 
the facilities in the Physical ED-
ucation Department for relaxa-
tion and exercise. Equipment is 
available for weightlifting, gym-
nastics, wrestling, karate, judo, 
trampoline, ping pong, and bad-
minton. 

The UCSD Judo Club is holding 
regular workouts on Monday and 
Wednesday evenings from 7:15 
to 9:30 p.m. All interested are 
welcome as both participants and 
spectators.

Coach Chuck Millenbah has 
this week-end on his mind. His 
grapplers go against UC Santa 
Barbara in an extremely rough 
match that could see the Tritons 
on the bottom of the pile. 

This is not to say that the 
wrestlers won't be ready; both 
squads are very well matched in 
the 130, 152, 167, and 160 pound 
weight categories, but UCSD has 
bee plagued by lack of a heavy-
weight for the entire season, and 
help is not around the corner. 
Willi Lorenzen hasn't seen action 
for a month, and with two others 
hurt, the match will be very 
tight. 

The following Tuesday sees the 
wrestlers at UC Riverside a-

No matter 

gainst a fast improving team. 
The Riversiders were beaten 
once this season by UCSD 24-15, 
and the Tritons should win again. 

Millenbah said that despite 
some injuries, the team is in 
all-around top shape. Workouts 
are keeping the squad hard at 
work, while assuring their fitness 
for the Biola Invitational, and 
NAIA District 3 Championships 
in the latter part of February. 

Baseball practice will be held 
daily, from Monday through Fri-
day, from 3:00 to 5:00 p.m. at
