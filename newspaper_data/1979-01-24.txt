$1.97 Million Could Be 
Cut From UCSD if Brown 
Budget Plan Approved 

By Kathy Huffer 
S('nior Slaff Writer 

UCSD may cut $1.97 million 
from next year's budget if the 
state legislature approves Gov. 
Brown 's proposal to eliminate 
$20 million from the UC budget. 

According to Chancellor 
William McElroy. the cutbacks 
would affect various depart-
ments within the university. 
One target of the cut would be 
the admini tralion which : 
McElroy estimated, could lose 
$600,000. 

An aide to Bernard Si co. 
Vice-Chancellor of Admini-

tration , howcvcr, aid th<lt she 
"would like to know where he's 
(McElroy) getting hi figure ." 
She stressed that " it's going to 
take a lot morc specifics" 
before any deci ' ion will be 
made to implement cut . 

McElroy sa id that 15-20 
administrators have already 
been cut from the univcr ity 
because of Propo ition 13. If 
more admini trators were to 
lose their po ition , he aid, the 
first to be affected would be' 
those seeking reappointments.

Native Americans will be the

Goulde sa id that one aim of 
the seminar will be to "de-

I leditoriall 
t\.n Explanation 

of Our 
Advertising Policy 

Uur advertising policy has sometimes been a subject of 
debate within the UCSD community. Most recently, we 
were criticized by acting Revelle Provost Ralph Lovberg, 
who said that the number of alcohol ads we run might 
contribute to an already existing alcohol problem on 
campus. Decisions to carry ads from groups as diverse as 
the CIA and the Young Socialist Alliance have been the 
subject of attack during the paper's history . 

TheO ... 'cIIM Wed .. Jan. 24. 1979 

Obviously, there are some people who care about the ads 
we run, the _criteria we use to judge those ads, and their 
effect on the community. To those people, as well as the 
community at large, we owe an explanation of how we 
decide. 

We are, at least nominally, a business . Unless we can 
provide enough revenue to cover our costs, we fold. T he 
news, the sports, the arts, the opinion we gather would be of 
no use to anyone if we had no medium to communicate 
within. To provide that revenue we can go to the community 
and seek ads orto the university and seek subsidies from the 
a d ministration or the Associated Students. We would rather 
rely on the advertisers, who we rarely cover or deal with 
editorially, than the AS or the administration, who we 

' report on regularly. Relying on the latter has a terrible 
potential for conflict of interest. The former still harbors 
that danger,' but to a far lesser degree. 

The Silver Screen Has 
Scabs, too, in a UniOri 
That Can't Af'ford Division 

The vast majority of ads we receive run because the 
advertiser can pay for them. Occasionally we will receive 
an ad that is considered controv~rsial enough to warrant 
consideration by the paper's editorial board. In such a case, 
we are no longer looking at the advertiser' s ability to pay for 
the space, but rather to our judgement of whether the a d 
violates the standards of community taste the board 
perceives to exist. This judgement is, we admit, rather 
nebulous . 

To put it simply, we, like all other students on campus, 
really have nothing to guide us but the feelings we have on 
what is right and what is wrong. The small number of ads 
we feel need our scrutiny would not effect our a d revenue if 
we rejected them a ll , so it's strictly on a moral basis . 

It would be easy to reject them all a nd avoid any 
criticism, but there seems to be some greater ideal, some 
standard that we can determine and should act by . 

Our decision is on whether we feel the a d is oHensi ve . 
Simply put, we will carry a n ad as long as the ad or the. 
organization behind the ad isn 't dee med by the board to be 
morally offensive to a significant portion of the campus 
community. 

We welcome debate over our advertising policy . That 
debate brings us closer in contact with the community and 
the feelings we hope to know, a prime goal of a ny 
newspaper. 

It's not al right to sca b and it 
never wil l be. Right now, 
graduate students in t he drama 
department of UCSD are being 
tempted to work in com· 
mercials because professional 
actors' won't; they're on strike. 
Some will justify crossing the 
picketline by saying it won't 
hurt anyone. That's a lie. While 
Jim Garner, Henry Fonda, 
Michael Landon and half 'a 
dozen .other famous actors 
make hundreds of thousands of 
dollars a year when there isn'ta 
strike going on , the simple fact 
of the matter is that eighty·five 
percent of the Screen Actors 
Guild (SAG) membership is 
unemployed at any given time. 
When there's a strike, they feel 
it, and the longer that strike 
drags on, the worse off they are. 
So, you can't justify scabbing 
by saying it' s harmless. 

There is another kind of 
reasoning which allows a 
dramu student to cross a 
picketline because hel she isn't 
a SAG or AFTRA (American 
Federation of Television and 
Radio Artists) member. "After 
all," they say, " I 'm not a 
member of the union. I'm noton 
strike. And besides, this is my

big cha nce." This is the worst 
kind of oppo rt un ism and 
immora lity. Although drama 
students aren:t SAG and 
AFTRA members now , five 
years down the road they ' re 
goi ng to want to join the 
professional community . And 
by the time they have learned 
enough craft to join SAG or 
AFTRA their scabbing will 
have cost them money . They'll 
have to live with a contract 
that's a result of their strike-
breaking. But worst of all. their 
scabbing might cost the actors 
their unions . 

In 1953, over twenty-five 
years ago, actors won the right 
to be paid percommercial after 
a long a nd arduous fight. Now, 
in 1979, the na tional and multi-
nationa l corporations who fill 
our TV screens with their 
advertisements have said they 
will not negotiate a new 
contract wi-th the actors until 
they agree to an .. a lternate 
scenes" clause which would 
allow the actors to be paid a 
single fee for a day 's shooting 
regardless of how many 
commericals are made. That 's 
like working in an automobile 
factory and being told by 
manugement that even though 
you ma ke five cars a day , they 
will only pay you for one, and 
that when and if they sell the 
other four cars, then you'll get 
paid for them. 

It's a ludicrous demand, but 

the corporations think they can 
make it stick. They hi red J ohn 
Mcguinn to negotiate fo r them. 
This is the man who was 
management's representative 
at Harlan Co u nty. He 
represented the airlines during 
their strike and even though 
they (management) lost, he 
wus quoted as suying, " I kept 
those bastards (the pilots) out 
for u year. It ' ll take them ten 
years to make up what I cost 
them! .. 

Scabbing doesn ' t even make 
sense financially. A pro-
fessiona l actor gets $212 a day 
minimum p us residuals which 
can add up to about seven 
thousand dolla rs for a national 
commerciul. The scabs are 
getting fifty to <.I hundred 
doll a rs and no residual s . 
Management is getting the best 
of both worlds - bargain rute 
101 bor and the professionu I 
actors are still out on strike. 

Any way you look at it , it 
doesn 't make sense to cab. It 
hurts professional uctors, it 
hurts future professional 
actors, und it ullows manuge-
ment to use scabs in the most 
exploitutive fashion . These are 
hardLy things for an <lrtist to be 
proud of. 

So, think ubout that, and 
when you get approached to 
audition for u commercial tell 
them to go to hell. It mukes a lot 
more sen e thun cabbing.

Silly Students Object , 
to Alleged Guardian Tie 
Editor: 

We object to the Groucho 
Marxist Caucus's letter which 
ran last week. This letter linked 
the Silly Student Organization 
to T he Guardian! This is 
absurd . The Silly Student 
Organiza tion was founded by 
Hi Supreme Silliness, our 
exceedingly silly leader with 
the purJ)ose of raising the level . 
of si lliness on campus. While it 
is true that two Guardian 
sta ffe rs were judged Silly 
enough to joi n our organization, 
they represent but a small purl 
of our rapidly growing 
membership. And bt!sides, His 
upreme Silliness dominates 

every aspect of Our organi. 
z~tion ~nd wields complete, 
d. tatonal powers. It is even 

too silly for us to believe that he 
would relinquish his trangle 
hold to the likes of th e 
Guardian. 

We also want to take this 
opportunity to express some of 
our many plans for this 
quarter. We will attempt to 
have all AS money allocated to 
our orgunizution to assure all of 
it , ra ther thun most, is spent in 
exceedingly silly ways. We 
hope to eliminate all early 
classes as silly students can not 
maintain consciousness at this 
time . We also plan to urge local 
TV stations to show Monty 
Python 's Flying Circus during 
commercials. 

We ask the Groucho Marxists 
to support U8.

About 2,000 UFW members at

Triton Swimmers Stroke to Victory 

Men Divers 
Cause Defeat 
of Pomona 

The men's swimmers 
escaped a late cutchup try by 
the newly established Cal Poly 
Pomon<.t diving team to lrickle 
p;.ISt them 60-45 . 

Poly found themselves losing 
48-45 with twoevent!ii remaining

natatorium. 

If Triton di vel' Brad 01 will 
earned five points for a first 
place fini h in one meter 
diving, UCSD would advance to 
an eight point lead . Even the 
seven points Pompna could get 
if they won the .roo free relay 
would not be enough for a 
victory. 

So they needed a econd place 
in thedivingevent. evermind 
th e fuct that they had nodivers. 
The Poly coach found two 
willing swimmers to enter the 
evellt, then held up the meet 
while the swimmer/divers 
found some dives in the 
swimming hundbook that they 
recognized . 

UCSD coach Bill Morgan 
made no effort to cont<.tin his 
disgust at the Poly tactic.-' 'This 
is BS," he su id as he wutehed 
the divers Iumely attempt their 
dives. The fuct thut the divers 
had to yell ucross the pool to the 
meet announcer what theil' 
dives would beonly added to the 
crowd's l"lUghter and the 
circus- l ike utmosphere the 

had ta ken on. 
But one diver , Rick Sisk, 

pleted five of hi s six dives 
even scored a nine from one 

ge. The other new diver 
mpleted one dive . enough for 
third place. 
So the meet came down to the 

free relay of Jim Agronick, 
Nelson Howard . Lance 
Hul ted , and Joe Hernandez 
against Cal Pply . After 350 
yards. Hel'l1andez und the Poly 
swimmer were even and 
stroking furiously . The teillnS 
and the spectators ' eume to 
their feet as Hernandez pulled 
uway in the final 25-yard length 
to help the Tritons upset the 
highly ranked NCAA Division 
II J)ower. 

After the meet , both divel's 
were disqu .. i1ified for not 
electing the l)rOper dives, 

meaning that whole sltow was 
for nothing. 

But while Saturday was a 
biza ne duy for divi ng, it was an 
outstanding duy for swimming. 
The free relay time would have 
beaten UNLV. SDSU and 
Co lorado State in lust week' , 
meet.

ivision Re-structuring Welcomed 
By John Klock 

UCSD s intercollegiate 
women's teams will no longer 
be classed with schools offering 
major scholarships, starting 
next September. 

The change is a result of a 
restructuring of divisions in the 
Association of Intercollegiale 
Athletics for Women (AIAW), 
approved during the week of 
Jan. 8-12. 

" We at UCSD are delighted," 
Judy Sweet . intercollegiate 
athletic director, said. 

" The new structure will 
make_ it possible for our 

women's teams to be more 
competitive. since our division 
will include only schools that 
share a similar philosophy and 
financial base, " Sweet said. 

The change will put UCSD in 
Division III, competing against 
schools awarding athletic 
scholarships of no more than 10 
percent of a student's expenses. 

" The former structure was 
based on size of female 
enrollment. We were in the 
large college bracket, those 
with over 3,000," Sweet 
explained. 

Thus on the way to nutional 

level competition, UCSD could 
face schools such as UCLA, 
USC. 

Under the new rules, non-
scholarship schools may elect 
to compete in any division, on a 
sport-by-sport basis, Sweet 
suid. 

Division I will include schools 
awurding 50 to 100 percent of a 
student's expenses in athletic 
scholarships, and Di vision II 
will be for schools with a 
maximum of 50 percent 

Schools ure to make a 
commitment as to which 
qjvision they will compete in by 

March I. 
At this point, ,l<:l'Ording to 

Sweel. it's too early to tcll 
which schools UCSD will be 
grouved with. She named 
Rl'<iland, Point Lorna and 
Pomona-Pitzer as vrob.lble 
Division III local schools, und 
Riverside, Chavm,1O and Cal 
State Dominguez Hills as 
vrobable Division II schools. 

The chunge was well-
received by "j ust about 
everyone," uccording to Sweet. 
She suid the only debate on the 
change ut the AIAW Delegute 
Assembly was what the 

Copy a one-hour cnsselte In less than 2 minutes. 
Now: Copy cassette tapes yourseU-any 
length. There is a convenient Rezound Cassette 
Copying Center near you. Fast: You can 
copy one-hour cassettes in less than 2 minutes, 
And, both sides copy simultaneously. 
Simple: With Rezound, copying cassettes 
is easy as xeroxing a letter. Inexpensl.e: Our

tinest quality tape-designed tor high-speed

copies. The Rezound cassette copier will make 
up to 3 copies ot a single cassette-
simultaneously. UnUmlted Uses: We've 
only scratched the surface, but the potential 
uses for cassette copies are endless. Here 
are just a tew of the most common 
applications: lectures, seminars, language 
labs, meetings, college classes, sermons, 
sales messages, weddings, interviews, talking 
letters, family events, relaxation, word-
processing data, & computer programs.

1 M . SONOR Performs Blend of Modern USIC 

--- ---

By Vidya ~olani 
Music in tJ,e last century has 

become so diversified that one 
no IODler lulows what to think 
when someone mentions 
"contemporary music." Does 
that mean rock or punk rock or 
jazz, or the new forms of 
electronically and computer 
generated musical sounds, or 
perhaps what has bled over 
(rom the expressionistic period 
at the beginning of the century? 

The latter description could 
probably fit SONOR the best. 
SONOR is a twelve·person 
contemporary music en · 
semble, which has abided for 
two years at UCSD under the 
direction of the music 
department chairman, Ber-
nard Rands. 

programs focus on twentieth 
century music, both standard 
and experimental. 

One of the experimenl<.ll 
pieces that SONOR performs is 
a composition by Rands called 
" deja 2." 

" It uses the voice as an 
instrument," Rands described. 

produced works for radio und 
film. while working in 
electronic music studios across 
tbe world. 

SONOR. along with regular 
instruments. also makes use of 
tapes with electronically 
generated music in their 

music groups in the United 
Stutes . Runds l'eports an 
audience of 450-500 peOI,lc as 
"mixed from all parts of San 
Diego. We are interested in 
expunding to our audience both 
on ctlmpu and (rom San 
Diego." he said. "We wallt to 
reach more and more people so 

to tour the n'ltion (lnet Europe in 
1980-1981. and will tour the UC 
campuses st'lrling f'ebruary I.

music faculty will also have 
their works included in

and "" .the serpent snapping 
eye." a piece for I trumpet . 
I)ercussion <lnd computcr 
generated sound. by Rogel' 
Reynolds. will feature Edwin 
Harkins on trumpet and Jean-
Charl es Francois on per-
cussion. 

" SONOR comes from the 
word sonority meaning ' to 
sound'," said Rands. The 54-
year-old British conductor and 
composer, who has been at 
UCSD for three years, and who 
has performed with inter-
nationally famous orchestras 
such as the London Symphony. 
the German Radio and the 
Australian Broadcas ting , 
explained what . he meant by 
" new music." SONOR is a twelve-per on music ensemble that was formed two years \lgo. 

Another com position in -
vol vi ng the use or electronically 
generated music is "Piano 
Piece" by Oily Wilson . which 
will be performed by pianist. 
Cecil Lytle. D<lllapiccola's 
" Due Iyrichc di Anadreonte." 
and Ri set's " Dialogue." will 
ulso be performed. 

" The voice just hums along." performances . " These are 
co mputer-generated using 
analog and digital systems." 
sa id Rands . 

SONOR is one of several new 

that they can understand the 
mu ic of our time." 

SONOR. whi ch has per-
formed nationally before. plans 

"The musico! ourtime. " said 
Bernard Runds. smiling, " is no 
better and no worse than 
previou ' mu ·ic. It i ' just 
different. .. 

"It bas a larger sound 
spectrum and more sound 
sources tban previous forms o( 
music," he said. " It is more 
complex, but not necessarily 
more difficult to pl ay or 
understand. " 

Rands expressed the group's 
main concern as " to learn the 
music of our time and prepare 
it in such a way that it can 
interest the audience." Their

The Guardian 

ange in Library Ho.urs Unlikely 
By toby Raymond 

A fre"lu 'nt complaint among 
many U~SD students deals 
with th~ I ck of hours that are 
available at the campus 
libraries. In particular the 
grievances are directed 
towardl:l the abbreviated hour 

, of Central Library. 
Central University Library, 

which accommodates more 
than 2/3 of the volumes owned 
by the university, i available 
for student use 82 hours per 
week. while the Humanitle 
Library is in operation for 92 

hours over the same period, 
The difference in hours can be 
accounted (or by the fact that 
Central closes two hours earlier 
than the Humanities Library 
ea ch weeknight. 

According to Acting Assis-
tant Uriiver ity Librariim Marc 
GiLtlesohn, "It takes much 
larger staff to operate Central 
than the Humanities Library. A 
minimum staff of five workers 
are required to operate 
Central. while only two are 
mandatory at Humanities 
Library." In terms of salarie , 

Central University Library i ' 
two and one-haH times more 
expensive to operute. 

An additional financial strain 
is pluced on the librurie 
because of recent Proposition 
13 budget cuts and the fact that 
fUll(\, must be divided between 
ix university libr.tries . 

Besides Centrul and Humani-
ties libraries the univer:ity 
operates the Science ancl 
Engineering. Bio-Medical, 
Scripps In titute and Uni -
verity Hospital Librarie -, 

Although Central hus ulmost

organizations. 

Both Annala and Woodard, 
like Brown , are interim 
appointments, Vice-Chancellor 
of Student Affairs Richard 
Armitage , in a summer 
reorganization of the student 
affairs office, named Brown to 
the position until. Armitage 
says, a new director could be 
found or Brown found himself 
another job. 

As part of that reorgani-

zation, Armitage has sacked 
four of twelve of his staff, 
including three administrator 
and one clerk. 

As Annala and Woodard take 
over, the search for a 
perm:Jnently assigned ad-
ministrator to deal with both 
job continues , The search 
committee for the new director 
has lowered the number of 
applicants to 85 from about 150, 
accordi ng to An nala, just on the 
basis of reading applications,

Annula say that some of the 
applicants "areveryexciting." 
Approximately five o( the 
applicants, she says, are from 
UCSD. 

Whoever i s selected by 
Armitage and the committee 
will take over July I in order to 
avoid requiring the new 
director to walkout of whatever 
job he or she might be doing 
when the appointment is made.

six times the squure foot;Jge of 
ilL, the latter accommodates 
more than 4000 putrons per 
day . while Central serves just 
under 3000 due to its location on 
campus. Combined with the 
lesser opel'uting costs making 
HL more economical to 
operate, 

Reacting to u proposal thut 
one hour per day be reallocated 
from the schedules of the other 
librarie to allow Central to 
operate for additional hou rs, 
GiLtle 'ohn commented, " If' we 
were to clo e the other librarie 
arlier we would be confronted 

with a problem . Tho e who 
de 'i red highly specialized 
material would not hiJVe acce s 
to it." 

The central libraries at UC 
Berkeley and Stanford are 

operated for exactly the same 
hours us Cent I'" I at l 'CSD. 
Powell Library at UCLA is 
aVClilablc for only one hour 
longer euch weekday. 

Gittlcsohn re 'ognized the 
fact that many student s are 
"just looking for a quict spotlO 
study and do not desire to usc 
the rcfcrcnce materia\." 

In an attempt to satisfy thes~ 
requests the Library Adminis· 
tration has begun work on a 
proposal to rede ign a portion 
of the study area in HL. 

. removing it from the reference 
area. Due to the fact that the 
reference material would be 
unavailable, lhe stuff could be 
reduced to one person, allowing 
the library to rema in open for 
longer hours. 

Health Groups 
Form Coal ition 

By Je(( Sokoloff 
A new coalition, representing health organization such as the 

Heulth Experience Leuming Program (HELP). Students ,Acti ve 
Toward Community Health (SATCH) und Black Student Scien ce 
Organization (BSSO), is entering its second quurter of existence. 
Coordinated by Revelle junior Dail SI. Clair Bacon and Health 
Science Advisor (HSA) Mike McCraugh . the Health Science 
Coalition (HSC) has combined the efforts of severa l health 
organizations. 

One of the objectives li sted in the HSC constitution is to pl'ovide 
" more efficient communication between (health) groups-and the 
II A office." 

" The lISC was formed." ',lid Bacon, "so th .. t he .. dth 
organiwt ions could pool their 1" OUI'CCS and set down their goals. I 
was hoping to find ways for increasing co mmunicLltion hclweclI 
the va rious groups, After.J II. wc' rc <Ill heu lth orgllnizations and we 
shou ld have some overlapping interests." 

This (werlap bet wecn organization, \ViiS a fmst r<llion for Bacon. 
" One group would pl,1I1 ,.I prograt'n. but none or the other 
organizations would learn of the evcnt until it \I'LIS ovcr anel dOIl(, 
with. Ortentimcs there were prognlllls planned th,lt othcr group~ 
wished they were involvcd in . A main objective therefore was to 
get thc groups to corroborate where they could corrobol"Ill'." she 
said, 

B,ICO(] alluded to on success of the cO<llition. "An ,dread\ 
positivc exumple of the Hi ' found in the lecture series. 
cu rrently being IJut on by the He,ilth Experience Lew'ning 

P~'ogram . Other groups already have knowledge of this series 
(received thr ugh the HSC meetings) anel cnn inform their 
mcmbers of the lectures," 

McCr,IUgh , who has organized Llnother lecturc ser ies through 
the lIealth Sciencc Advisory Program (HSAP) . explaincd someo[ 
thc functions of the liS '. ,. E:ach 0 rgLln iz,lt ion has a represent ,lt iw

They also hold underwater 

trike races every year, but 
their most common under-
water activity is, of course, 
scuba. 

"We have dives several days 
every week, wei.lther per-
mitting," Frank said. Every 
qUi.lrter the group ti.lkes a trip to 
Baja California. Boat trips to 
the Channel Islands, Ci.ltaliml 
and the Coronado Islands, are 
regular events. 

The i land diving offers 
isolated area without "so 
many people" and virgin beds 
where lobsters and abalone arc 
still abundant , Frank claims.

The si.lberists lost to both 
schools by scores of 3-6. 

Helmich is hoping for a third 
place finish in this weekend's 
important All-Ca l Tournament 
in Si.l nta Cruz. "We should do 
pretty good although Berkeley 
i.lnd Sant·a Cruz will be 
dominating ... Helmich said . 

"I think we could really beat 
them." said the saber team 's 
Stuart Voytilla of the tougher 
llorthern chools. 

The fencing team hi.ls five

The university had pre-
viously expected a budgetof$67 
million for the next academic 
year. The Program Option 
Committee, however. had 
recommended cuts reaching 
$1. 7 mi ll ion last fa ll . 

"The Escondido club just set 
it, and we're going to smash 
theirs," Frank said. He also 
mentioned a possible world's 
record underwater monopoly 
tournament. 

In Baji.l, completely different

ARMS LIMITATION -
Carter said that "if the Soviet 
Union continues to negotiate in 
good faith. a responsible 
strategic arms limitation ' 
agreement will be reached." 
He said: " I will sign no

ladder," Goulde remarked. He 
cited a paradoxical condition in 
the U.S. ~hat native Americans 
face: very few Indians, he said, 
have the opportunity to go 
beyond high school while 
education is heavily em-
phasized in American society. 

Goulde said that no more 
than 35 native American 
students have attended UCSD 
during an academic year. He 
added that San Diego h~s a 

population of about 10,000 
Indians. 

Goulde commented that the 
cultural series may show 
students that " the university 
experience is not an insular 
one" while at the ame time 
develop a feeling of community 
among tudents.

seminar will begin at 7 p.m. in
