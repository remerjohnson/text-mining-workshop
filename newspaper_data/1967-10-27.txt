exactly how far it should go 
inits search for revenues for 
the University. Higgs explained 
that Regent Dutton has sugges-
ted that agriculture should help 
pay for the University because 
of all the benefits it has re-
ceived Cram University re-
search. 
"But industries, taxpayers, and 
students themselves have bene-
fitted Cram the University. No-
one who has attended the Uni-
vers ity of California can say 
that he won't benefit financially 
from the work the University 
has done. No taxpayer can argue 
against the benefits to CaU-
Cornia which the University has 
made possible. The point is, 
all facets of the state have 
benefitted from the wor k of the 
Univer s ity. Now it is time to 
figu r e out some fair share which 
every facet should contr .!bIIte to 
meet the problem."

Hell e IS War 
WIse man, Sherman. Apparently, he Ls one of a bandtul of people 

to think about the situation, at least until the last five years. So the 
recent rash of anti-war demonstrations would lead usto belleve. Tbe 
Vietnam conflict is a diffIcult and messy situation; in one word, it is 
indeed, hell. 

The armed forces of this country are bogged down In a seemingly 
senseless war. with few tangible goals, and even fewer tangible points 
of progress. A mistake seems to have been committed, and hopefully 
a way out can be realistically found. So far, we have neither seen 
nor heard any reaUstlc solutions. Immediately, exceptioo w1l1 be 
taken, and someOlle wUl scream, "The only solutiOll Is to pull out 
Irrevocably, unconditionally!" Such splurbs were beard and seen 
last wee~ as thousends poured into the streets of Oakland, Calif, 
in an apparent attempt to close the doors of the local induction cen-
ter to new draftees. "War is immoral" and "The draft Is unfair" 
were some vocal reasons given to explain the crowd's reaction, but 
we question the majority's "moral" reasons, just as we questlOll 
many of the motives of the lootlngandldlllng of last summer's racial 
"rebellions" • 

"War is Immoral": we agree, but unfortunately, humaonature otten 
seems to see war as expedient at the same time. Many of those who 
so fervantly claIm to be against the U.S. action is Vietnam on moral 
grounds were the first to ralse tbe battle cry in support of the "de-
fensive" manuveurs of the victorious Israeli forces In last June's 
skirmish. n appears that even "virtuous " people live the double 
standard of the modern "Establishment" when sueb coincides with 
their pb1losophy and goals. 

rn any event, let us hear some real solutions to the Vietnam prob-
lem, ratber than emotion-laden rhetoric. We bope that this country 
has lost some of its naivite' regarding the world situation. Govern-
ments cannot be run on gratitude, as Charles De Gaulle bas graphic-
ally shown in the past few years. We feel that the bogy of eommunism 
has lessened as a speclflc threat to this country, but let us not be so 
complacent as to assUme that there are not ccncerted efforts to un-
dermine the foundations of this country. 

No mattel "bat some claim, this country is stUl run on a 'major-
Ity-rules' basis. By such actiOlls as we witnessed last week in Oak-
land (and tlls week in Washington, D.C.), those very members of 
the voting (oUbllc, whose support Is needed for any cbange in draft 
laws, or in foreign pollcy, are repelied and alienated. Not because 
many are not in sympathy, but more because such demonstration and 
property da mage snows eumplcto di l"erud for law and order. Let 
the leader~ of these demonstrations do some hOlIest and learned 
th1nk1ng, u tIley should be capable of doing, aDd attempt to devise 
solutions UI clouded by pure emotion. 

Some wlll cry that morals can never be compromised. Show us 
one person wIIo can claim that he has never compromised his morals , 
or anythln& elSl! necessary for life. and we will show you a ltar or a 
hermit. In the same sense, oowever, differentiate between compro-
mise and concessloo: concessiOns were made in Muoich in 1938, and 
Europe was overrun in 3 years; concessions were made in Korea, 
and we stUl have troops there euardingthe border; eonc:ess lons were 
made In Hungary In 1956, and the nationalist revolt was quickly 
erushed. Coocesslons are unconditionally made in V1etnam. and. •••• 

Sherman made his no" famous statement, but be was a soldier

under orders, but we are certainly under a responsibility to propa-

Senator Sue Dascomb said 

afterwards that she would not

Medical School 
DrawsonColiege 

Upon their completion facll1-
ties of the Medical school w1ll 
include the San Diego County-
University Hospital. the Vet-
er ans' Administration Hospital, 
a Biomedical Library, and the 
Office of Learning Resources 
(OLR). 

The San Diego County-Uni-
versit y Hospital is located 13 
mlles to the south of the ma.in 
campus near the heart of this 
metropolis. It meets the needs 
of medical students, supple-
menting the opportunities pro-
vided at the campus medical 
center, since community medi-
crne, comprehensive and con-
tinuing care programs, and su-
pervised work under actual op-
erating conditioos are best de-
monstrated and taught inacom-
munity hospital. 

The Biomedical Library in-
cluded within the initiai basic 
science construction project 
w1ll serve the biology faculty 
of the enUre UCSO campus and 
the School of Medicine. The 
projected size for Fall 1968 is 
60.000 volumes and more than 
3,000 periodicals. 

The Ottice of Learnillg Re-
sources was established early 
in the planning of the new UCSD 
School of Medicine to devise and 
introduce advanced methods and 
tools for handling inIormaUon. 
The OLR has the task of pro-
ducing, gathering, dissemina-
ting and storing non printed in-
formational material. The 
components lor presenting tac-
tile. audio. or visual lnlorma-
Uon will be catalogued and made 
avallable to faculty and stu-
dents. 

Related facUities include 
Scripps Institution of Ocean-
ography, Scripps Clinic and Re-
search Foundation. and the Salk: 
Institute lor Biological Studies. 

Scripps Institution of Ocean-
ography and the School of Med-
icine ofter cooperative oppor-
tunities for study and research 
in marine-oriented areas of 
biomedicine. The Scripps cam-
pus borders the PacUic just 
west of the main UCSO campus. 
Scripps Clinic and Research 
Foundation is a non-profit cor-
poration founded in 1924. Under 
the direction of Edmund L. 
Keeney, M.D .• it occupies most 
of a large square block in the 
heart of La Jolla. The ob-
jectives of SCRF are to con-
tribute to scient1!fc medical 
knowiedge. to train medical sci-
entists and to provide medical 
service of high quallty in those 
restricted areas where unusual 
competence exists at SCRF. 

This aerial view sbows tbe locatloo or tbe DeW lacllltles in relation to tbe rest of UCSD. Revelle 
is promlDeat III tile Iorp-oand. 

The overall purpose of the 
Salk Institute for Biological stu-
dies is to encourage the de-
velopment of investigators who 
are able to thinJc: and to work 
with more than one discipline 
on questions in fundamental bi-
ology and on problems of human 
relevance. It is a ceuter I lJ( ad-
vanced research in the liIe 
sciences.

Toptber with tbe ineYibble academic classes, tile Fall se-
mester usually briDes will it a fired-up desire to pit the old 
sc:bool fooUall team &PInst the most formidable of opponents. 
Bat, belac JOUDC bas its drawlJacts as any frustrated 'UCSO foot-
ball star" can testUy. 

For the past three years the big baby of the UC system bas 
Jeamed to waa:, talk and teacb calculus. but little headway bas 
been made to DIll the besoectacled infa.nt into a football uniform. 

SeemiDgly to insure tbe eootlnuation of tills college anomaly, 
a namor DOW exists tbat UCSO's administration will never allow a 
tackle footblll team. Those who narrate tllis choice bit of gossip 
taYe m1stateDly quoted Provost Sallman as saying tllat the UCSD 
administration is. for some reason, utterly and entirely against tile 
wbole Idea ci tackle football in any form. 

In attempting to discover the trutll of tile matter, the Triton 
Times interviewed tbe Revelle College Provost and discovered tbat 
the administration balks only at tbe idea of atllletic scholarships 
aad tbelr eoosequences. Eventually, tIlought Dr. Saltman, such a 
prop-am could result in a UCLA or USC type of football machine, 
injuriDg the scbolastic standards of UCSO. 

Somewllli later in the interview, Dr. Sallman was asked wbat Ile 
tboacbl c( sports at UCSO, particularly football. Contrary to current 
belief, be deftDitely supports a wide variety of sports including foot-
ball aud is pleased at the progress UCSD bas made toward intro-
dueiDc sports into tbe curriculum. "I might add, bowever." he 
eoat1Dued. "that sports is and should remain an extra-curricular 
r.netlon. At DO time sbould it interfere witll the academic or 
sebolastlc staDdards of UCSD." 

WbUe tbese DDdiDgs can somewbat allay tile fear of admini-
strattooal OIJPOsitiOll to a UCSD tackle football team, no amount of 
sacb coochrill from the bJcber echelons w111 create a working team. 
studeat init1atlye aod support is tile answer, and at tbis very mo-
IDIIII petWoos are beiDg circulated by several students including 
A.S. Vice-President Hen Sweetwood to harness and put to work 
tile OK c( those wbo are interested In seeing a team started. If 
JOII ... a team, sign one c( tbese petitions. All the information 
you aeed c:oacernJag this matter Is on page Z of tbe Triton Times 
llaler tbe IIeadllne GrldlroIl Playoffs Soon? 

Not to be too .poeaJJPlIc, but perhaps when UCSD bas expanded 
to Its fIdl twelYe college campus. tile Revelle football season will 
coasist 01 eleYeD pmes with eacb of tbe other colleges. This 
system woald sat1sfJ tbe administration's COneem over big-time 
football at UCSD wblIe f1lling the studeats' need for a tongh, COm-
petUhe sport. The sport would also be lp to inculcate tbe idea of 
separate, c:ompetinc colleges at UCSD.

ProfessorNFORDPe:ner 
Named AIAA Fellow 

The American Institute of 
Aeronautics and Astronautics 
yesterday announced the el-
ection of stanford S. Penner 
as a Fellow of the Institute. 

Fellows are persons of dis-
t1Dctloo inaerooautics or astro-
oautics woo have made notable 
and nluable contributions to 
the arts, sciences or technolo-
gy thereof. They are nominated 
and elected by the Fellows re-
siding in the United States. 

Penner, professor and chair-
man, Department of the Aero-
space and Mechanical Enlctnee-
ring Sciences at the Univer-
sity of California, San Diego, 
was one of nine aerospace sci-
entists and engineers who re-
ceived the award from the 
33,OOO-member institute this 
year. 

Penner received his Master 
of Science degree in 1943 and 
his doctoral degree in 1946 
from the University of Wiscon-
sill'. He was on the Californ-
ia Institute of Technology fa-
culty from 1950-1962, where he 
served successively as assis-
tant, associate, and professor 
(1957-1962) of Jet Propulsion. 
He was Director of the Re-
searcb and Engineerlllg Dlvls-
ion of the Institute for Defense 
Analyses in Washington, D.C., 
from 1962 to 1964. 

Since 1964, Penner has been 
professor and chairman of the 
UCSD Department of Aerospace 
and Mechanical Engineering. He 
is a Fellow of four other learn-
ed societies and was elected a 
Member of the International 
Academy of Astronautics in 
1965. 

Council Sends Saftison 
Dorm 

The Inter-Hall CouncilofRe-
velIe College has sent its chair-
man, Robbie Battison, to the 
fifth annual convention oC the 
Pacific Coast Association of 
College and University Resi-
dence Halls, which is being 
held this week, 26-28 Oct.. 

Convention 
at San Fernando Valley State 
College. 

The theme of the convention 
this year is "Resort to In-
volvement," an attempt to deal 
with the problems of student 
apathy and campus disunity. 

Among the highlights of the 

LSD Harms Genes 
This past Wednesday; Dr. 

Stanley Mills, Associate Profe-
ssor of Biology at UCSD, urged 
bis 12 o'clock Biology class 
in USB 2722 to thint seriously 
about the possible genetic con-
sequeoces of lysergic acid. 

This sub-topic was closely 
related to the lecture theme 
concerning genetic systems and 
cbromosome anomalies. 

Dr. Mills warned ottwo po-
ssible consequences of LSD; 1) 
an increase in the frequency 
of chromosomal aberrations in 
the cells of regular users of 
the drug; 2) an increase in the 
frequency of malformations in 
embryonic development. 

Although the incidence of 
chromosomal aberrations in the 
cells of users of LSD is only 
twice the normal rate, statis-
tics on the subject are con-
sidered to be signHicant. 

Quoting from 'Science' Maga-
zine, September 15, 1967, Dr. 

Milis discussed experiments 
cooducted with rats and mice 
in;ected witb LSD during early 
pregnancy. For tbe animals w~b 
LSD, the number of normal 
embryos was 67. wbile tbe num-
ber of abnormal embryos was 

91. Animals wblcb were not in-
jected bad 59 normal embryos 
witb 5 aboormal. Tbe amount 
of LSD injected into tbe ani-
mals was correspondingly low-
er tban a single dose normally 
taken by a human being. 

200 firechiefs to Learn 

Techniques ot UCSD 
San Diego: Two hundred fire 

chiefs wlll gather on the Uni-
versity of California campus 
here October 30 to be trained 
in the latest administrative and 
fire-fighting techniques. 

They will be attending the 
third annual CaWornia Fire 
Services Staff and Command 
School, presented by Univer-
sity of California Extension and 

tbe State Department of Ed-
ucation. 

Reagan 
Regents' 

Applauds 
Resolution 

Tbe fire chiefs and their 
top administrative aides. from 
all over CaJ1tornla, will be wel-
comed by Edward W. Bent, 
supervisor of the fire training 
program, Bgreau of Industrlal 
Education. Also on band to open 
the flve-day conference wm be 
Cblef Ray Shukraft of the San 
Diego Fire Department and Dr. 
Martin Chamberlain, director 
of University Extension, San 
Diego. 

Then the ftremen will wade 
into five days of lectures, mee-
tings and panel discussion on 
subjects ranging from organ-

I~tion of manpower to fighting 
forest fires with aircraft. Governor Ronald Reagan 

praised University of California 
Regents for adopting a new 
policy resolution prohibiting the 
use of University campus fa-
cilities for unlawful purposes. 

The Governor was informed 
of the precedent-setting policy 
declaration wbile attending the 
National Governors' Confer-
ence. 

In a statement relayed 
through his office here, the 
Governor said; 

"I have heen informed that 
the Regents of the University 
of California today unanimously 
adopted a resolution which will 
have a significant impact on the 
use of University facilities by 
those who advocate and plan 
willful violations of the law. 

Regents for their positive at-
tempt towards solvin, a major 
problem at this great Univer-
sity. And I want to assure the 
people of California that this 
Administration will cooperate 
in every way to see that tax-
supported Institutions such as 
the University are not in any 
way used to further the illegal 
activitles of any group or in-
dividual," 

Class sessions of the confer-
ence will be held in Sumner 
Auditorium Scripps institute of 
oceanography, UCSD. Novem-
ber I conference participants 
will have a banquet at the Tor-
rey Pines Inn, where most wlll 
be housed. Information regar-
ding the school is available

Is Money Enough? 
I think that all of us who heard 

Dr. Ruff's lecture on the econo-
mics of air pollution a few Mon-
days ago were made rather un-
easy by his method of economic 
gelding of tbe pollution pro-
cesses. For those of you who wer-
n't there, the essential ideas are 
this pollution must be made ex-

pensive. Each polluter, whether 
fertlllzer factory or automoblle, 
must pay the federal government 
an amount commensurate with the 
damage his pollution causes his 
fellow man. 

Each gallon of a certain type 
of sewage would be worth such 
and such, so that they may do 
with It what the yare dolngnow-
a-days for free (dumping it in 
the ocean). Each driver must 
pay a tax proportional to how 
much he drives (steam and elec-
tric cars excepted). Since all of 
the causes would have a price, 
all oC the effects must be stu-
died and ghen a corresponding 
amount. 

How much is it worth to a man 
to have emphysema? Blindness? 
How about the diseases DDT con-
centrations cause? In Dr. Ruff' s 
system, all of these things must 
have a fixed considered dollars 
and cents value to the man re-
ceiving them, and he must be 
paid accordingly. ThUS, the na-
tural evolution Inherent In a 
capitallstic society would stamp 
out pollution cesses simply 
because it would be cheaper to 
do so. 

I agree with Dr. Rutf (and I 
hope I've paraphrased him cor-
rectly) that his scheme would get 
the job done the fastest out of 
all methods thus far proposed. 
However, I feel that in taking a 
step forward in the environmen-
tal SCiences, we would take a 
corresponding step backward in 
the social sciences. 

Even more than at present, 
the common man would be re-
duced to an economic unit, a 
pawn whose tastes and opinions 
can be antiCipated, an~lyzed, and 
manipulated by those more po-
werful forces. Everything would 
have a price, including bls eyss, 
his mind, and his very life. 

Man would again be for sale 
on the Market. In the lecture, 
when Dr. Ruff was asked If there 
is anything a human being po-
sesses that does not have a price, 
his considered reply was, "No." 

Considering the irreversabl-
lity ot some. of the processes we 
are diddling with, in a few years 
this whole Question may be an 
academic. ' However, man 
must stop living in his own gar-
bage and putrifying hls planet, 
not because it costs a lew more 
pieces ot paper, but because it 
Is wrong.

Tear Gas: an 
occupational hazard 

I am a student at UCB and work 
part-time in the Inter Campus 
Transfer office of Berkeleyad-
missions. I have been very dis-
turbed by the event of the past 
week. One person has been kill-
ed, another blinded, many injur-
ed, and many more subject to 
incredibly inhuman treatment up-
on arrest. 

Because the pollce have issu· 
ed 2,500 John Doe warrants, any-
one could be arrested at anytime 
for anything. You could be just 
rapping with a group of friends 
and be arrested for an illegal ral-
ly. Believe me, it's unreal to 
have to worry about possible ar-
rest whenever a group of pollce-
men start walking in your direc-
tion. 

Last Tuesday I was walking 
through Sproul Plaza on my way 
to class and was bombarded with 
tear gas from a helicopter 200 
feet above my head. Choking and 
crying, I looked for an exit and 
saw that the National Guard and 
police (wearing gas masks) had 
blocked aU exits visible to me. 
Trey admit now it was a "tacti-
cal error' 

I consider it much more-I con-
sider it an unbelievably inhuman 
action. When things like this are 
going on 'with the University's 
support, I find it morally impos-
sible to work in a university of-
flce and to help them carryon 
"business as usual' • Therefore, 
as of this morning, I am refusing 
to work in a normal way amid 
these abnormal conditions. 

I wlIl return to work as soon 
as the state of emergency Is lif-
ted, and the unnecessaryoccupa-
tion troops removed. I wanted to 
tell you fellow students exactly 
why your appllcations are not 
being processed. I hope that, it 
you are concerned by this situa-
tion, you will do something. 

Start complaining, start de·· 
manding the removal of troops 
from the Berkely campus-It only 
to tind out if you wlll be accepted 
for Summer or Fall Quarters. 
Thank You.

Portrait of a Humanitarian 
(Editor ' s note; The following article Is written 

by Roger Showley, who is returning home to 
San Diego vla Asia from Hong Kong, where he 
was studying under the Education Abroad Progra m. 
Showley was News Editor last year and will return 
to the staff next year in the position of Associate 
News Editor). 

Of the many contrasting faces of ' present· day 
india, one that stands out as particularily unusual 
Is that of Dudley Gardener. Every day for the last 
eleven years this white·bearded Brlton has de-
livered curry and rice to 3100 starving Indians 
in the backstreets of Calcutta. His reason: to 
gIve a few a t solid, warm meal they can count 
on once each day. 

As we drove away in his recently donated 
landrover, Mr. Gardener was transformed into 
a twentieth- century Santa Claus. All the ingred-
ients were there: the generous, hefty grand-
father; the sleighlul of goodwill; the elf-like 
helpers; and the certain spirit that all this was 
worth the happy faces who greeted him at every 
stop. 

But the 102 degree weather outside onaswelter-
ing afternoon in May seemed to dispel any gaiety 
such a Christmas-like occasion usually produce". 

. Along the bumpity streets were crowded hundreds 
of idle Indians, begging their next meal, washin~ 
in the urine-filled gutter, or presuming to keep 
busy in their tiny huts. The overwhelming majority, 
however, had nothing to do. Theirs was tre saddest 
of all states, for their circumstances had declared 
that they should be without occupation. 

As Mr. Gardener tells ' it, he came to Calcutta 
after long service in ths British army. Eleven 
years ago the population was a bit more than 
3.5 million und suffering from malnutrition. Today 
14,052,500 meals later, the number is 7.5 million 
and the hardships more than twice as desparate. 
For ths state government of West Bengal and the 
national regime In New Delhi have lost control of 
the growth rate and lett agriculture to its own 
devices whlle India' s industrial capacity has been 
expanded. 

"Consequently," Gardener said, "the advanced 
nations of the world have had to pour in foodstuffs 
and other supplies just to keep India alive, not even 
considering improving the standard of living." 

Indeed, Gardener said, the situation has deter-
iorated. We could sense this as we passed all the 
dilapidated . vestiges of British India, once the 
jewel of an empire. There before us were chlldren 
and mothers holding out their small pill; to re- · 
ceive their only hot meal of the day, more otten 
than not their only meal. The green-brown curry 
splashed about in the aluminum pans, which filled 
the back of our land rover. The mounds of rice , 
were alongside, waiting to be sowed out to eager 
famllies along the way. 

We arrived at each stop, always behind schedule 
where recipients had been waiting for their meal. 
More likely, the line has formed of elderly ladles 
In ragged clothes, holding their grandchlldren 
under their shawls. Like clockwork, Mr. Gardener 
served up the rice without a halt. All would proceed 
to the end of ths line und get the ir cups, ladles or 
cans filled with the spicy curry that only indians 
can consume without washing it down, American 
style. Finally they were served with reconstituted 

milk, donated by the u.s. government, which, with 
other nations, also supplies all the soybean meal 
and rice Gardener can use. 

The crowds that stood on to observe merely 
reminded us that 3100 mouths are a lucky few to 
receive a guaranteed meal each day. But they 
do not live off Mr. Gardener's efforts Indefinite Iy. 
Alter three, six, nine, or twelve months, they are 
told that their ration must be stopped and they 
wlII have to fend for themselves once again. While 
government social workers decide woo can join 
the program, Gardener is the unfortunate one to 
inform them that their time has come. 

"Rarely, some people are put on again, " he 
explained, "but we discourage this since there are 
others who need the food just as much.' 

The program is famous throughout Calcutta, but 
is only one of Its kind. The government has its 
own programs, but Gardener describes them with 
an obvious undertone of derision. Amazingly, he 
says , the Indians will not carryon in his spirit, 
primarily because their Hindu customs and caste 
system present a barfler to interclass sympathy. 
His work, then, IS privately organized and financed 
from donations from church grouos, philanthropists 
and individuals all over the wor Id. At the sam 
time, he runs a small "choolfor children and visit 
those in need at night. 

A Significant Interest he also sustains in u 
makeshift hospital---a "home' - for "physical 
destitutes .' In an annex to a Hindu temple, two 
hundred disease- ridden patients, suffering from 
maladies as far removed as tuberculosis and star-
vation, Lie in the care of Indian nuns and a young 
woman social worker' from Australia. Walking into 
the hospital the sight of people on the ver~p of 
death was .frightening Just as we entered, what 
appeared to be a woman was brought in, hardly 
more than a frame of skin und bones. She barelv 
could move and flies swarmed about her tired face. 
As Mr. Gardener put it, "She is so far gone that 
she has lost all semblance of femininity.' Saddest 
of aU, the temple monks are pressuring the 
Communist· run government to restore their rights 
to the annex and send the patients into the streets. 

The future of Dudley Gardener's "meals on 
wheels" is as tenuous as that of next year's har-
vest. No one in Calcutta shows any interest in 
carrying on the 59-year old soldier's labors. He 
himself has not left the limits of the cHy itl 
eleven years, and he outwardly hides the physical 
necessity for him to take a vacation on his mili-
tary pension. One fellow Briton has said he would 
fly to Calcutta to carryon the projecttemporarily, 
should Gardener fall ill or become incapacilated. 
The Calcutta Santa Claus, however, is sure of 
the merit of what his energies in retirement have 
accompllshed. 

"I know," he declared, "that 3100 mouths a day 
have received a good warm meat. These children 
do not dese rve the physical conditions they live 
in. Are they grateful? They surely show it. Has 
their state improved? Over the years little boys 
and girls on this program have grown up with a 
greater hope for their future. U's quite a change 
for an old soldier to suddenly turn humanitarian, 
but I feel no paradox. This was the least 1 could 
do.' . 

Berfeeley .• "The Nightmare it Which' Live" 
I am hurt, angered, and ap-

palled. In the nightmare in which 
I Uve, I have seen pollce, clothed 
in bullet-proof vests, beating a 
student right In front of his 
dormltor}'-he had been doing 
nothing! I have seen the stretch-
ers carrying injured people from 

out of the dorm into ambulances. 
Since last Thursday over 100 
have been injured, many more 
arrested. One bo~5 years of 
age-is dead. Another boy has 
lost his sight. 

every street corner; the squad 
cars; hhs curfpw-all attest to the 
unnaturalness of this situation. 

I would be much more up in 
arms about this If Dr. RnU's 
scheme had much of a. chance 
ot getting through the legisla-
ture. I think the petroleum lob-
bies will take care of that and 
any other method involving the 
reduced sale of gasoline. How-
ever, I think that we should all 
be able to see the hidden dangers 
In this type of economic reason-
Ing. 

seLC contributions appreciated 
If this were a simple case, 

it would be easy to assign guilt 
and innocence. Unfortunately, it 
is a ve ry complex case. People 
did begin construction of a park, 
illegally, on university property. 
In subsequent scutfies with po-
lice, there have been rocks 
thrown from the crowds. Yet 
the pollce response has been 
more brutal, more vicious, than 
words can communicate. 

As members of the university 
community, you must realize that 
1t is impossible to continue with 
"business as usual" under these 
conditions. Many professors have 
already cancelled classes until 
the state of emergency is ended. 
Many more students have ceased 
classroom attendance for fear 
of gassing, beating, or arrest, 
(Pollce action is not restricted to 
active demonstrators--4lly per-
son walking on campus and not 
in unifo rm is treated as the-
enemy.) 

Theoretically, it is in accor-
dance with economic theory and 
I suppose my real gripe is against 
that. But I think lt Is unfortunate 
that this Is one of the better ways 
of cleaning up this planet. Many 
people in the audience were con-
servationists of a sort (and to 
go a level below that, humanists) 
and the Idea of putting a prlee on 
everything from gallstones to a 
developing fetus was repugnant 
to them. 

They would rather see pollu-
tion stopped by an awakening of 
the silent majority to the dan-
gers of Uving in their own filth. 
Man must develop a sense of 
pride in his earth rather than 
viewing lt as a slop paU, and call 
a halt to the rapid degeneration 
of his environment because of 
his own Intecrlty and sense of 
consCience, rather than being 
driven to it by the whip ofecono-
mic laws. 

In early April] solicited con-
tributIons, to be matched 50 per 
cent by myself, for a fund to re-
bulId the home of the Metcalf 
family in Marks, Miss Issippi. 
The home had been burned by 
arsonists as a result ot 13 year 
old James Metcalf's civil rights 
activities. Eleven individual stu-
dents plus the ladies of Dana 
Hall contributed a total of $43. 
Two of my associates and two of 
our secretaries contributed $20 
for a total of $63. I added $37 
to round the contributions to an 
even $100. 

I wish to thank all contributors 
on behalf of the Southern Christ-
ian Leadership Conference and of 
the Metcalf family. Duringthese 
days of healthy, and sometimes 
unhealthy ferment In our society, 
demands on the time and purse 
of constructively concerned citi-
zens, and in particular of students 
are continual, it not continuous. 

I am not disappointed in the re-
sponse to my challenge. 

Many extremists are sopessi-
mistic that they are convinced 
that society can only be reo 
structured by violence. Others, 
of course, are purelyopportun-
Ists. The pessimists are mostly 
too young rto have seem, and too 
disinterested in history to have 
comprehended the near revolu-
tionary changes In our SOCiety 
over the past twenty years. The 
changes have been effected by a 
determined minority in the face 
of strong opposition. I am an 
optimist. I believe that It the 
current youth can keep their dy-
namIc concern in the years be-
yond their formal education, the 
"Age 01 Aquarius" may well be 
a hand. 

Thank you again for your sup-
port. "We shall overcome." 

Sincerely, 
Dr. Raymond A. Grandey

~~[D(!JJnj.\[h ~, A. Seixas 
Moderate Finds Geddes' Logic Not too Convincing 

Here is the reaction of a middle-aged, non-
academic, non-radical tax-payer to Dr. Geddes' 
guest editorial. 

His accusation of bias rests on odd grounds; 
the paucity of faculty rebuttal to the Triton's 
Times ant i-Vietnam stance---a lack which to him 
renects on the academic exce llence of the UCSD 
staff; and the way the deaths of Eisenhower, 
Kennedy, and King were handled. In the fir st 
place, today 's students were children during Eisen-
hower's presidency; he could mean little to them, 
while the personalities, Ideals, and manner of 
death of Kennedy and King had intense meaning. 
In the second place, the Triton renected both 
youth's attitude and that of the nation's press. 
I doubt if a single story on Eisenhower's death 
failed to quote or mention his only memorable 
statement, the warning about the military-indus-
trial complex. It may well take its place with 
Washington 's farewell warning against foreign en-
tanglements. Dr. Geddes has apparently failed to 
take either to heart . 

AS to the lack of anti-Vietnam rebuttal: it 
clearly hasn't occurred to Dr. Geddes that his 
view of our Vietnam venture may be wrong, and 
that it was in fact a terrible blunder. It just 
might be that UCSD's historians, political and 
social scientists etc.-in common with a very 
large number of thoughtful people including clergy-
men, iawyers, scientists, elected representatives, 
most publications above the level of Readers Digest 
and, believe it or not, some military leader9-have 
taken the trouble to inform themselves and to 
think for themselves. If anti-Vietnamese messages 
are "a cloudy shade treason, " a very great number 
of Americans are gathered in its penumbra. 

Dr. Geddes' statements, on the other hand, reflect 
either willful or naiv blindness mm mms history 
of Vietnam and of our involvement. 

"South Vietnam" did not "call for help. " As 
Dr. Geddes mayor may not know, after the French 
lost their war for control of Indo-China, the 
United States installed Diem , a Catholic aristocrat 
and protege of Cardinal Spellman-a singular 
chvice for an overwhelmingly non-Christian coun-
try. The Vietnam-wide elections promised by the 
Geneva accords were never held; as Eisenhower 
noted, 80% would have voted for Ho Chi Min , the 
hero of Vietnam's long fight for independence. 
It was Diem's repression of the nationalists and 
Buddhists, re-installation of the big landlords, 
supplanting of locally-elected village headmen 
with Northern Catholics, etc., that ignited the civil 
war in the South. As our corps of "advisors" 
grew into a covert and then overt military force -
in-being, the trickle of infiltrators from the North 
(many of them Southerners who had "re-grouped" 
in the North pending the elections) increased. 
Finally, the U.S. bombing of the North turned the 
Vietnam venture into a full- scale war. 

The Geneva Accords never envisaged two sep-
arate states; the demarcation line was temporary. 
The conflict within South Vietnam, involvingthe two 
regions is similar in some respects to our own 
Civil War, as the century-long Vietnamese fight 
for independence has parallels with our own fight 
to get rid of the British. I would remind Dr. 
Geddes that Ky, Prime Minister and our client 

Wltil his praise 'of Hitler and similar faux pas 
grew too much to stomach, is a Northerner, a 
CatholiC, and a man who fought for the French 
against his own people's struggle for national 
autonomy. 

Dr. Geddes holds that it was a "vital self-
interest goal' for us to "preserve a non-commun-
ist government in South Vietnam and to help that 
country learn democracy." What vital self-interest 
tor Heaven' s sake? The easily-exploded and long-
discarded "domino theory' ? Doubtless an interest 
in preserving our economic hegemony in Southeast 
Asia-il poor justification tor interfering In the 
alfairs of a small and ancient nation, let alone for 
bombing it to bits. 

The arrogant ethnocentrism ot our intention to 
"help them learn democracy" defies my command 
ot polite language . The Vietnamese have managed 
fairly well without our brand of democracy since 
203 B.C. Their values, culture, way of life may 
conceivably suit them better than our brand of 
democracy-even if their way leads them to adopt 
their brand of commWllsm. As for our ideapistic 
dr ive to protect " the freedom of other peoples 
from the encroachment of minority groups of 
totalitarians," it all depends on whose ox is gored. 
What about our totalitarians-in Spain, Portugal, 
Greece, Latin America? Remember Trujillo, Dr. 
Geddes, and Batista and Somoza? Who Is pro-
tecting the freedom of the Haitians trom Papa 
Doc Duvullier? 

And as for "genOCide, ' perhaps Dr. Geddes 
should look up its definition. "Real genocide' 
could scarcely take place were the commWllsts 
to gain power, since quite evidently a sizable 
portion of the population is aligned with the N LF 
(ot which the communists are only a fraction). 
Again, too, it's a question of whose ox is gored; 
we didn't rush in to prevent "genocide" when 
500,000 were slaughtered by he anti-communists in 
Indonesia. We didn 't even slap them on the wrist. 

War is hell, as Dr. Geddes points out, and 
civil war is the worst sort of hell. But it is not 
genocide. On the other hand, the sort of war 
the United States is carrying out makes the or-
dinary carnage of war seem clean, or at least 
human by comparison. To say that "a relatively 
few civilians" have been "killed in an accidental 
context" is to display the most callous ignorance. 
Does Dr. Geddes know about " Puff, the Magic 
Dragon"---the DC3's that spit out 5,000 machine 
gun bullets a minute? (We give our engines of 
death disarmingly cute names.) An American wor-
ker in Quang Nai who observed one in action writes 
of "men, women, children and animals, caught like 
rats in a nood. No place to hide, no way to plead 
their case of innocence to the machine in the sky, 
no time to prepare for death ... The cold, mechan-
ical, compassionless way that monster circled a-
rOWld .. . stabblng viCiously earthward again and a-
gain, probing, searching, killing, and maiming all 
in its path." 

In the month of January alone, the US dropped 
129,700 tons of bombs on South Vietnam; more 
tonnage has been dropped on this one small 
peasent country than on all the Axis powers put 
together in World War II. A third of the rural 
population are homeless refugees; hundreds of

ture, role and quality of student

thousands of acres have been defoliated (with 
grave doubt as to the ecological consequences); 
the country is pocked with bomb boles 45 feet 
across, 30 feet deep--there are more than 2, 
500,000 such craters. Scores of thousands of 
women, chUdren, old people have been killed and 
worse--horr ibly maimed by anti-personnel bombs 
and napalm as well as by shrapnel, "ordinary 
bombs", bullets, etc. Children and old people die 
from the effects of nausea- gases; some are per-
menently blinded by Mace. As we "destroy a 
village in order to liberate it," we a.re destroying 
a country in order to protect our ~lsely con-
ceived " vital self-inter.est". And sacriflclng 
thousands of our own youth. 

And what Is the "democracy" we are helping 
them to learn? Thousands of political prlsoners--
"neutralists" and "peace advocates" rot in South 
Vietnamese jails; there is not even lip-service to 
freedom of press and speech; corruption is un-
believable as American dollars drain through the 
pockets of the Saigon elite, and into Swiss banks. 
Dr. Geddes must have a strong stomach, or a 
remarkable capacity for psychological "denial" 
if his conscience and humanity are not revolted 
by the dehumanized, technologically sophisticated 
agony we are imposing on a peasant country in 
order to sustain "our side" in power for "our 
self-interest" • 

As for Dr. Geddes' enchantment with the mili-
tary and with ROTC: to characterize anti-mili-
tarism or anti-ROTC Ism as "North Vietnamese 
psychological warfare" is simply ludicrous. The 
debate in this country over the propriety of (a) 
conscription and (b) campus accreditation for RO 
TC, has a long history. It is certainly moot whe-
ther the function of a university, tax-supported 
or not, is to provide the "OpportWlity to learn 
leadership and management skills in the armed 
forces" or to "learn a technical occupation". 
Nor is the campus the only locale for training 
officers. And Heaven help us if "the opportunity 
to gaIn self-confidence .. quiet pride ... emotional ma-
turity" Is lost to those who do not join ROTC. 
Were this the case, it would certainly be rank dis-
crimination to exclude girls and non-college youth. 

What comes through loud and clear from Dr. 
Geddes' editorial is his belief (1) that holders of 
Wlpopular views ("propagandistic") should be "re-
moved from campus with due process" --a bit 
difficult since the promulgation of obnoxious views 
is a constitutional right; (2) that anyone out of 
step with Dr. Geddes is ipso ~cto wrong, if not 
traitorous ; that the fact that very few scholars 
share his views is an indictment of the schoiars 
rather than of his own inadequate understanding; 
and (4) that his view of the way to "preserve and 
enhance our society" should prevail. 

Throughout history, Dr. Geddes, it has been the 
rebels , the holders of obnoxious views the "Ieft-
. ' wmg activists" of their hme, who by challenging 

the status quo and the "conventional wisdom" have 
moved mankind along the path to greater justice. 
Think of Jesus drlving the money-changers from 
the temple; think of those obnoxious early Chris-
tians, poor, dirty, unshakeablynon-conformist, who 
so defied and angered the Roman "establlshment" . 
As Goethe wrote, "He who calls the Child by his 
right name is ever crucifled and burnt. ..

Report From Santa Rita, 
A . Latter Day Nazi Germany 

(Editor's note: The followl ng 
report wa s transcribed Irom a 
tape compiled by KSDT from 
reports given by Jim Johnson, 
a student at UCSD. Johnson was 
in Berkeley shortly after the ori-
ginal march on the People 's Park 
and wa s arrested with several 
hundred other persons. He was 
taken to the Santa Rita detention 
camp and describes the brutal-
ities that ocurred during his . 
stay there.) 

• .•• the guards had blocked 
off the area in front 01 us and 
eventually the side of us, and so 
there was really no place you 
could go from there on in. There 
wa s a pretty good sized area 
and they started tightening it up 
slowly but surely. I walked over 
and said to a policeman, 'what 
do you plan on doing now, you 
know there was nothing anybOdy 
could do, we were just standing 
there.' And the policeman said 
'well, I'm planning on arresting 
everyone.' 

So I said, 'well, what U you 
wanted to disperse?' He replied ' 
'well, the only people that can dis: 
perse in essence are the people 
you know like the businessmen.' 
So, as they marched in, with 
mothers and other persons buy-
ing food in the grocery stores, 
people were pulled right out in 
the street and arrested. 

We arrived in Santa Rita; the 
arrival was actually great be-
cause they didn't say anything and 
they didn't do a thing to us. 
But when we got to Santa Rita 

people. They would piCk out a cer-
tain person who looked suspici-
ous or who had long hair, and 
they would grab this guy off the 
ground and rip him up. They 
would say, 'what the hell are you 
doing here.' 

The most common word that 
they used was 'fuck'--theywere 
calling us everything in the book. 
They would sit there and talk 
back and froth to each other about 
how we stink, about how they 
were going to get us now because 
'you're in our playground now,' 
but once in a while they would 
have us move the lines and tighten 
them up. 

The fir st time they did this 
they said, 'alright, line do' which 
happened to be where I was. 
'line d, get up and get over to 
line c. So verybody started to get 
up and stand up. Well, the first 
person that got on his feet they 
knocked right back down on the 
ground again and told him to 
crawl on his hands and knees. 
They told everybody they didn't 
want anybody in this compound 
above their knees. 

One guy happened to call a 
policeman who had just walked in 
They didn't know what to expect. 
This guy told the cop that he was 
a punk for hitting him so hard, 
and the police just blew up. They 
went and slaughtered the guy. 
They had us turn all our faces to 
the right so we couldn't see what 
they were dOing, but all we heard 
was this clubbing and screaming 
of this guy. 

I got Inside -and they were 
booking me. They were being 

he just stayed there. 
They had practically every-

one's camera, and they didn't give 
us receipts for them, so I was 
a little worried about my camera. 
I was watching the guard with 
all the cameras and he was treat-
irig them like he didn't know what 
they were. He was exposing all 
the fUm in the cameras by sit-
ting there and ripping open the 
backs of the cameras. 

That night the guards didn't 
want us to sleep at all, so they 
would come In every half hour and 
make us stand In front of our 
beds at attention. If we didn't 
keep our eyes straight ahead 
and look straight ahead, they'd 
beat us to the ground. One guy 
smiled twice (even though It was-
n't funny, you didn't really be-
lieve it was happening), and they 
ripped him up by the shoulders, 
tore his shirt up and threw him 
outside , and then they beat him 
up outside, and then he came 
back In. 

They didn't let us sleep all 
night and they used sort of ter-
ror tactics; you didn't know what 
was happening next. They had the 
windows open, and gave us one 
thin blanket apiece, so that all 
of us were freezing to death. 
One guy was leaning against a 
post with his nose and his feet 
four feet behind him with all of 
his weight on his nose. Three 
guard were walking around him 
and they were hitting the post a~ 
hard as they could with their 
sticks. You could see it hurt him 
and they kept hitting him under- ' 
neath his chin and on his back.

Military Recruitment Still an Issue Spring QU~~~~~~~~~~. 
referendum and outside police were removed by Bzouce Mordim, A. S. Senatc?r 

Upon Captain Stout's last visit, 
on May 23, it became obvious that 
open military recruitment is not 
possible at UCSD. The Poll con-
ducted May 5-7, which included 
graduate as well as undergraduate 
students, showed that a majority 
of those voting favored open re -

cruitment~ 1 % for, 39% against, 
with 2147 voting. 

Yet certain members of the 
campus community feel that the 
Marines as well as other mili-
tary recruiters have no place on 
campus because they are con-
trary to the educational purpose 
of the University. Because of the 
Marine involvement in the US 
genocide experiment, a well or-
ganized effort to protest Captain 
stout was again implemented. 

Knowing of these campus plans 
as well as hearing reports of the 
VFW and American Legion's 
moves to come on campus and 
"protect" Captain stout, the ad-
ministration made an effort to 
avoid an out and out confronta-
tion. An effort was made to post-
pone Captain Stout's visit until 
the turmoil that already prevailed 
on campus aissipated. Captain 
stout refused. 

Chancellor McGill issued a 
statement saying that the recruit-
ment would not take place in the 
recruitment office at MC 250. 
Those of us who signed up for 
interviews were thus placed inl 
an interesting position: we didn't 
know where the interviews were 
to be held. 

The demonstrators wanted as 
much, of not more, to know where 
the recruitment was to take place. 
The original organization was 
deployed on motorcycles and 
scooters at all the entrances and 
exits to the campus in an effort 
to detect the recruiter or those 
who were going to the recruiter. 
By about 8: 30 a group had gather-
ed out in front of MC 250. The 
crowd grew to about 150 per-
sons with mlxed objectives by 
about 9:30. The interviewees ar-
rived at Dean Murphy's office 
at about this time. 

Dean Murphy met with the three 
of us and told us of the plan to 
get us to the recruiter. We were 
to take the intercampus bus to 
S[O where we were to meet a con-
tact who would take us to Captain 
Stout. We decided to use our own 
transportation to get to Scr ipp's. 
As we were about to leave the 
phone rang. It was the contact 
at Scripp's. 

"They're pretty thick down 
here, too," he said. "I'm going 
down to the drug store at the 
Shores. Have them meet me 
THERE." 

We took ott our own separate 
ways to our new destination. One 
student took his motorcycle. The 

other two of us took a car which 
was parked at Revelle. We len 
the oUice one by one so as not 
to be obvious. The two of us who 
took the car met in front of the 
llumaniUes Library and headed 
down to the Shores. 

When we got the the Shores 1 
looked around for the contact, 
for I was the only one who knew 
who the contact was. His car 
was not in plain sight so, as the 
other two talked, I looked around 
trying to locate him. I found him 
in the alley behind the Pharmacy 
and the Market, inconspicuously 
reading a newspaper. I tapped on 
the window and said, ·You are 
certainly doing a good job ot 
hiding. We can't even find you !· 

I went back to get the other 
two and when we all were In the 
car we backed out. We then 
drove 8 or 9 blocks to get to the 
La Jolla Beach and Tennis Club 
(wtJch is about 4 blocks away) 
and then headed into La Jolla. 

Our contact turned to us and 
asked, "Do any of you know where 
Westcott Street is?" 
We all said no whereupon some-
one asked, "Do you know where 
we are going?' 

"No/, lauged our contact. 
·They only gave me an address. ' 

We stopped in the Shell Station 
on Prospect St. to find out where 
Westcott st. was but they didn't 
have a map and our contact didn't 
want to ask. We went to the next 
gas station, got a map, and asked 
where Westcott St. was. No one 
know. There just was no West-
cott st. in San Diego! We thought 
for a while and someone said that 
perhaps it was West Scott St, in-
stead of Wescott Street. There is 
a Scott St. in Point Lorna near the 
Naval Training Center, but we had 
our doubts as to whether or not 
Captain Stout was there so we 
stopped and called Dean Murphy 
to find out where Captain Stout 
was. 

It turned out that the street 
was Dickenson-not Wescott or 
West Scott at all. We then knew 
the recruiting was to be done at 
University Hospital in Hillcrest. 
Meanwhile back at Matthews, the 
protestors had been playing it 
pretty cool even with all the tac-
tics of Dean Hull driving Dean 
Murphy' s car and other decoys 
driving around in University ve-
hicles. The crowd waiting in front 
ot 250 was Informed that the re-
cruiter was at University Hos-
pital. Someone called the hos-
pital and found that Captain Stout 
was indeed there. This was 
strange, for the protersters ac-
tually know where Captain Stout 
was before we did. Some of the 
protesters then tried to organize 
a caravan to go down to the hos-
pital to protests. 

Regents Wrap-up 

About three or four minutes 
after we arrived, the few dem-
onstrators that came appeared. 
There was acutally no picket-
ing, and the protesters left before 
the interviews were completed. 
Certainly, had the Interviews 
been held on campus, there would 
have been more protersters pre-
sent. Can we let this minority 
of students disrupt what the ma-
jority has approved: open re-
cruitment? 

Again let us observe the poll. 
The last question was, "Should 
legal avenues be explored to ex-
clude from the campus some re-
cruiters, including those repre-
senting the military services, 
on the grounds, for example, that 
(heir presence is incompatible 
with the educational objectives of 
the Unive rsity?- The vote on this 
question was closer-46% for, 
54% against, with 2158 voting. 
Is- it possible to retain open re-
cruitment and still satisfy the 
46% who are in some way dis-
satisfied with the military? 

One suggestion which has been 
made by both sides is that Captain; 
Stout set up a table in the Plaza 
at Revelle. Captain Stout com-
plains that MC 250 is too far 
away from the main body of stu-
dents. He claims he has no effect-; 
ive way of reaching undergradu-
ates for his PLC-Platoon Lead-
er Camp-program. The protest-
ers admit that Captain Stou t is 
already indoctrinated Into the 
Marine tradition. They only want 
to stop others from being simi-
larly Indoctrinated. 

The Plaza scheme, where Cap-
tain Stout or any other recruiter 
disseminates information in the 
Plaza, allows for ·rational- dia-
logue between the military and the 
anti-military, yet the recruiter 
still has the opportunity of the 
private Intervie w which he is 
now accorded. 

There will still be protest-
ers. There is also more chance 
for violent disruption. There wllI 

~ protesters as long as the mili-
tary is involved in any unpopular 
action and persons retain the right 
of dissent. 

Let us show that UCSD is 
capable of mature actions. Ac-
tions which will enhance the Uni-
versity's function of learning and 
critical thought. It is possible for 
mature intelligent persons to dis-
cuss rationally even with those 
with whom they disagree. Let · 
UCSD be an example tor the 
community of San Olego to fol-
low and be proud.

or who had resigned. While Regents meet-
ings were interesting as a spectator sport, 
complete with close roll-calls and llvely 
debate at the beginning of the year, by 
March they had degenerated into a one-
sided sounding board for Reagan policies. 

course content and individual personalities 
for the Ilrst time. And, as Regent Dutton 
chided the Regents at UCLA in March, 
they consistently refused to really expose 
themselves to student opinion, evn moder-
ate student opinion. 

Just as the death of Martin Luther 
King Is said to mark the end of the non· 
violent protest movement, the silent pro-
test at San Diego and the Regents sub-
sequent action marked the end, tor all 
intents and purposes, of any reasonable 
bellef that the Regents could be influenced 
by "responsible" presentations. 

. taboos "",,ell 
With great distress to such Regents 

as Dutton, Roth, Coblentz, Simon, and 
perhaps a few others, the Board broke 
several taboos. It betrayed faith in the 
faculty and the Chancellors by deaiing with 

when w" uc rem,er? 
This is perhaps a chic he by now, but 

to anyone who has even the slightest idea 
of what today's university is or should be, 
the Regents are totally out of touch with 
reality. Dealing with the emerging cries 
of a new order the same way the law-and-
order freaks are handling social protest 
throughout the country, the Regents are 
bringing down the University of California 
with them. 

In just one short year so much happened; 
who knows how long It 'liJll take to undo 
the harm that has beeD done? 

Included in the election were 
two referendums and an opinion 
poll. Proposition A asked that 
special financial assistance, 
drawn from private sources, be 
given to athletes. Students de-
fea ted the proposal 1630 to 572. 
The proposition was an outgrowth 

I of demands made by the athletes aimed at boosting the leve I of 
excellence displayed by our ath-
letic teams. After the defeat 
of the proposition, it was an-
nounced that Inter-collegiate 
football will be cance lied inde-
finitely. 

PropoSition B asked whether 
students should assess them-
selves a fee to build one or 
more student cente rs on campus. 
Students approved the measure 
by the necessarx two- thirds mar-
gin, 77% to 23%, with o\'er 600/£ 
of the students voting. 

The opinion poll concerned re-
cruitment and was divided Into 
four sections. The fir st one 
asked whether study fee monies 
should be usid to support the 
Placement Office, and students 
voted 70% yes and 30% no. The 
second asked whether the uni-
versity should have a policy of 
"open recruitment" , and 61r;;; 
voted yes with 39% voting no. 
Part three asked whe ther the uni-
versity should have a policy of 
"closed recruitment", and this 
resulted in 22% yes and 78<)t no. 
Part fou r asked whether legal 
avenues be explored to determine 
if some recruite rs, such as the 
military, could be excluded from 
the campus. The students ap-
peared split, with 460/, voting yes 
and 54% voting no. Results of 
the poll will be used by the AS 
government in formulating its 
policie s next year . 

new donn po'icy 
The inter-Hall CoucH and ad-

ministrators of Reve lie College 
announced that each suite would 
in the future decide what its 
visitation policy would be. This 
milestone in human relations was 
secured after yeu s of effort 
on the part ot numerous stu-
dents, many of whom were kicked 
out ot the dorms for their ef-
forts . The new policy repiaces 
the old idea 01 a set of visi-
tation hOurs tor all the dorms, 
and it was announced at a buf-
fet dinner given by Char ley 
Moore. 

Revelle College also announced 
·that the constitution tor the Re-
velle College Government was 
ready to be submitted to the 
students. The plan includes a 
Judical Committee, Committee 
on College Affairs, anei the RC 
Executive Committee. Students 
will vote on the charter next 
year. 

waher mun" 
UCSD, always glad to see one 

of its hometown boys make 'good, 
rejoiced at the news that Dr. 
Walter Munk had been nam ed 
California Scientist of the Year. 
The $5,000 prize goes to the 
Scripps scientist who measured 
the progress of ocean swells 
across the Pacific Ocean. As 
a further reward for his efforts, 
Dr. Munk ' w11l retire {rom the 
Chairmanship of the Academic 
Senate, to be replaced by Dr. 
Gabriel Jackson of the Histor y 
Department. 

on strike 
Finally, to round out the year, 

we had a st rike. The strike 
was the result of the violence 
near, within, and above the Ber-
keley campus. Reacting quickly 
to the death of James Rector 
and to the helicopter gassing 
of Sproul Plaza, about 800 stu-
dents voted on Tuesday, May 20, 

from Berkeley. 
The strike gained support 

quickly, not only from this 
campus but also from other cam-
puses around the state. A stri-
kers' newspaper was put out, the 
Strike Daily, and an Information 
Center was established to link-
up with the rest of the campuse . 
Sporadic pIcketing took place the 
following day but th~ most in-
terest was focused on the Aca-
demic Senate m~eting and on the 
convocation sponsored by the ad-
ministration. 

convocation 
The convocation witnessed 

pleas for "rational discussion' 
of the situation at Berkeley by 
::hanceJlor McGill as well as 
calls for a general strike. Pro-
fessors He rbert Marcuse and 
Linus Pauling spoke for a short 
time, each endorsing the idea of 
a strike. The meeting was at-
tended by about 2,000 students 
and faculty but slowly fe 11 apart 
without endorsing or rejecting 
the strike. 

Later that afternoon the Aca-
demic Senate met to discuss the 
proposals for LZC. BSC- MA YA 
had by this time joined the strike, 
however, and refused to discuss 
the college until the conflict at 
Berkeley was resolved. The 
Senate then moved to discuss the 
Berkeley situation. Eventually 
the senate voted to send obser-
vers to Berkeley and urged its 
members to devote the next two 
days of cIa sses to a discussion 
of the Berkeley situation. 

The strike, after the action of 
the Senate, continued to gain sup-
port. Classes were sparsely at-
tended and many of those that 
were held dealt with Berkeley. 
Organization and spirit among the 
strikers seemed to rise and fall, 
but by FrIday it was still gOing 
strong with few incidents to mar 
it non-violent nature. 

The scheduled appearance of 
a Mar ine recruiter on campus 
Friday was expected to sever ly 
test the non-violentawroach, but 
the administration wisely shifted 
the interviews to a location re-
moved from the campus. Thus 
Friday passed quietly, with many 
of the strikers pr eparing to go to 
Davis to join the march on Sa-
cramento. 

academic senate 
On Saturday morning the Senate 

met in special session to hear 
reports from Berkeley. 

The Senate then passed the 
Kroll Resolution which endorsed 
the resolutions of the Berkeley 
Academic Senate. 

Another convocation was held 
Monday morning, during which 
the faculty obse rvers from Ber-
keley reported to the academic 
community. The strike was still 
continuing but without faculty 
support it was severely cripplect. 
Due to the convocation, and 
continued anger and disgust over 
Berkeley, tew classes were held 
on Monday. Monday was a day 
of general strike activity all over 
the state, including a peaceful 
march to Sacramento in which 
150 UCSD students took part. 

retum '0 nonnal 
On Tuesday t 'le strike was fad-

ing fast and th campus was re-
turning to nor mal. There we re 
intense discuss ions among the 
striker!. as hwtlat theIr tacUcs 
would be , but by Wednesday 
morning a statement wa is cd 
which called oU the strike. The 
statement indicated that the 
strike had be n a succe sand 
called for continued discussion 
concerning the Berkeley situa-
tion. 



Studen March on Capitol ' 
With Feeling of Brotherhood 
(Editor's note: The.foUowlng is an eye-
witness report on tbe march on the capi-
tol building whlcb took piace a week ago 
Monday by Craig starr, a Triton Times 
staff member who participated In the 
march.) 

We began gathering at the staging area at 
10:30 a.m.~tudents from all over the 
state of California. We had come to march 
and to de monstrate the solidarity of stud-
ents everywhere over the Berkeley crisis. 

Some of us had arrived at UC Davis, 
some fifteen minutes away, earlier in the 
weekend; others were just arriving in 
Sacramento. Now, on Monday, May 26, 
students representing all the campuses of 
the University of California and many state 
and junior colleges converged on one empty 
lot at the head of Capitol Mallin prepar-
ation for the march to the Capitol steps at 
the toot of the Mall. 

Organizers at UC Davis had secured a 
parade and assembly permit for the four -
block march and rally a few days earlier 
trom the Sacramento police. Rumors were 
rampant that weekend that Governor Rea-
san and the Sacramento county sherill-
(up for re- election that year) were eager 
for a confrontation and would make politi-
cal gains out of any violence growing out 
of the march. 

If that was so, the Sacramento police 
did not betray any such feelings, for the y 
were very cooperatlve and eager to help 
the march ieaders in conducting an organ-
ized, peaceful activity. U anything, by 
march time the pollce were conspicuous by 
their inconspicuousnes~nlyenough of-
ficers to cordon of! the Mall from traffic 
were visible. 

Units were held in readiness just blocks 
away, and National Guard troops had been 
stationed a tew miles away in case of an 
incident, but they were invisible the whole 
time. Since their presence would probably 
have provoked just the incident they were 
supposed to avert, it was in the bestinter-
ests of all that they were. 

The students, eager as they were also to 

'avoid a violent clash, had made their own 
preparations for that undesired possi-
bility. Anum ber of AC LU lawyers and law 
students were standing by to assist in case 
of arrests. Earlier that weekend advice on 
how to conduct oneself so as to avoid the 
outbreak of a riot, and what to do in case at 
arrest, was circulated among the students. 

Medical students were organized into 
teams to offer medical assistance if need-
ed . student spotters were reportedly on 
rooftops to report on police and troop 
movements around the area, and a plane 
circled the area as a lookout for possible 
movements of Na ional Guard troops. 

The preparednes! of both sides combined! 
with the virgorous d termination that had 

brought some studel.ts as far as 500 miles 
to march four blo/~ks created an atmos-
phere of mixed exe it$ ment and apprehen-
sion In the staglr g d.l t:d. . With n!J rVnlt 
laughter students ooked up each time a 
helicopter passeda~ circled over the sta-
ging area. 

Some students :racked jokes, others 
seriously discusse j 'he march and the is-
sues of Berkele}. Fr.:>m the tops of 
buildings overloo~ ing the lot, newsmen 
watched and reported on the growing 
throng at students. 

Some eighty UCSD students signed up 
during the week to go to the march. 
But by march time it seemed there were 
close to 150 or more from the San Diego 
campus . It was a bitter disappointment to 
many of us that no faculty from UCSD had 
come, but then no faculty trom any of the 
other campuses were reported to be there 
either. 

One very pleasant surprise , though, wu 
the presence of Dean Alan Batche lder, Dean 
of Muir College. He wore his black academ-
ic robes, and it was by tar the most po-
tent personal protest by any individual 
there. 

As the time approached 1:00 p.m., the 
scheduled time for tbe march, some 250 
monitor s, who directed the marcb and or-
ganized the marchers, began to organize 
the mass of students into two columns 
of eight abreast. The two columns would 
move out into the street, the second 
snaking behind the first, when the march 
began. 

Students had grouped into contingents 
from their respective schools. Many ot 
the schools carried banners or signs iden-
tifying themselves and calling for an end 
to violence and asking "Do you care?" 
Elsewhere thoughout the crowd signs were 
carried that declared the age of peace 
called on Reagan to resign, and deplored 
the armed troops in Berkeley and the at-
tempts to close down ·People's Park". 

Suddenly, at a few minutes after 1:00 
p.m., the signal was given to begin. Fit-
teen minutes earlier the police had silently 
appeared to close oU the Mall to traffic on 
one side at the lush, green parkway that 
divided the length of the street. Then, 
beneath a very hot Sacramento sun, we 
moved out with the warning to stay off 
the grass and walk in the street, eight 
abreast, arms Interlocked towards the 
Capitol building tour blocks away. 

The Mall is lined with several build-
ings that house state government depart-
ments, including the Department of Edu-
cation. As we walked slowly, halting oc-
casionally as the front ranks bunched up, 
people appeared In office windows of these 
buildings, as well as on sidewalks on bOth 
sides of the streets. 

Most stared impassiveley, neither ob-
viously hostile nor sympathetic, and 1 could 
not help wonder aloud to the girl next to me 
what they must be thinking. But not all 
were stoics, and many waved and flashed 
the peace sign to us. 

In one window a placard appeared bear-
ing the insignia of peace, We cheered at 
these signs of support and returned the 
greeting. As we passed one building under 
construction, a few of the workers stopped 
to wave and signal their support. The rest 
went on about their work. 

It was a wonderfully unusual, fraternal 
feeling as we walked down the street. 
A few of us wondered if we should sing, 
and someone asked a nearby monitor it it 
Wd.S alright to sing. She said yes. Dean 
Batchelder carried a radio to listen to 
news reports, and it was blaring Beatie 
music, so we started jOining in, "I want to 
hold your hand." 

The tirst ranks to reach the Capitol as-
sembled on the steps and the rest of us 
settled back from there as we reached the 
end of the march. Turning to look back 
we could see a solid mass of students 
stretching back over the parade route, still 
marching to the Capitol, and a speaker trom 
the lectern set up tor the rally told us there 
were still people in the staging area who 
had not even started walking yet. Official 
estimates placed the crowd that day at 
6200-7500. It was short ofthe expected and 
hoped-for 10,000 to 15,000, but It was still 

Later, it was revealed that Reagan did 
meet wjth 12 representatives trom the 
march that day. According to both sides 
nothing much as accomplished during the 
session that lasted nearly an hour. Two 
students angrily walked out after several 
minutes. 

The rally was moderated by Mel Posie, 
a graduate student from UC Davis and 
chairman of the march steering commit-
tee. After a prayer for peace offered by 
a minister, the rally began with an address 
by two-time Nobel Prize winner Dr. Linus 
Pauling, late of UCSD, and soon to be at 
Stanford. 

He was followed by an assortment of 
speakers including Wendy Schlesinger of 
the People's Park Committee from Ber-
keley, Jim Hawley from the Radical Stu-
dent's Union at Berkely, and other speak-
ers from Berkeley, SanJoseState,andone 
student from Canada who pledged the sup-
port of our Canadian brothe rs for the 
Berkely students. 

The rally ended with a minute of sil-
ence for those wounded and struggling 
in Berkeley. 

CJdte an impressive expression of the im-
portance the students of CalUornia attri-
buted to the events at Berkeley. 

There did not appear to be any legis ~ 
lators present when the rally finally began. 
There were a number of newsmen and there 
were later reported to be FBI agents on 
the portico landing above tbe steps. But 
Reagan never showed up the entire time, 
and neUber, to all appearances, did any 
other officials. 

It had been rumored that Reagan would 
appear, and preparations had been macle to 
greet him in strong cold silence , withabso-
lutely no reaction to his presence or to any-
thing be said. But he did not appear, and it 
was afterward said by some that he was 
specifically asked not to come, by others 
that he just wasn't asked at all. 

Candidly speaking, the rally was a 
disappointment. I suppose there was always 
some divers ity of opinion concerning what 
was the objective of the march. I had en-
visioned it as an expression to the people 
of Callfornia, and particularly to Reagan, 
that the students were solidly united a-
gainst his violent overreactions to the sit-
uation at Berkeley and against the sbut-
ting down of a UC campus by armed for-
ces. 

The governor's office had long portray-
ed those concerned interested students as 
a handfUl of radicals and "trained revo-
lutionaries· bent on destroying the Uni-

- versity. It was bigh time, I felt, that we 
show him unequivocally that it Is not a 
handfUl and that we are not all radicals 
to be dismissed by a disdainful gesture. 
I, and many witb whom I talked, felt that 
we marched on Sacramento not to pre-
sent demands so much as to show who was 
presenting these demands. 

The march was a beautUul expression 
of thls solidarity, but the rally proved 
nothing more than a harangue directed 
at the students , who, after all, knew already 
why they were there and, in a lew cases, 
an attempt to radicalize the enUre student 
movement. 

I knew that some students had envision-
ed the march and rally as an opportunity 
to «educate' the otber students to a more 
radical, at least less moderate, view of the 
Berkeley crisis. Nonetheless, I could not 
belp feeling that the rally should have been 
directed at the public and the mass media 
in an affirmation of the demands already 
made, and a demonstration of the wide-
spread support tbe enjoyed. 

What final effect the march and rally did 
have is s till difficult to judge. Sitting in 
the bot sun, grateful for tbe occasional 
breeze that came our way, we had the 
feeling of doing something great, something 
historic. The impact of that day, of being 
there in person, somehow was lost though 
to those watching on TV, listening on the 
radio, or reading the newspapers. 

Hours after we had peacefully marched 
back up tbe Mall, once again waving and 
shouting to friendly supporters, after many 
students had started home while the rest 
of us, still with work to do, had returned 
to UC Davis; after we recalled with enthu-
siasm and idealism the events of the day; 
after all this I sat and watched with a few 
dozen other students a TV newscast olthe 
marCh, and I overheard one student des-
(Xliringly protes t , "They don't have the 
feeling of what it was like. The can't 
know how It was to be there by watching 
this replay. How can they feelthe brother-
hood and know when they weren't tllore?·

CAMPUS KIOSK 
UCSO, alongwlth other colleges 

and universities in Calitornia , has 
experienced a COIlS ide rable cut in 
Federal financial aid for 1969-70, 
reports Associate Dean of Student 
Affairs, Lynn C. Nafbert. Dean 
Nafbert stated that ·on most cam-
~ses in CalUornia, including UC 
SO, Federal surgery reduced by 
51 % the College Work-study Pro-
gram, the National Defense Loan 
Program request by 33%, and the 
Educational Opportunity Grant 
Program by 25%.· 

"I was particularly shocked as 
the Reponal Federal Panel in 
San Francisco approved all three 
UCSD programs at 100% of our 
request. The cuts occurred in 
Washington, D.C. where 'state 
percentages were imposed." 

"The explanation from Wash-
ington," Nalbert continued, "Is 
that more colleges, especially 
junior colleges, are applying for 
funds, and that there are simply 
more students with tinancial need 
competing for limited funds. The .

Spa s Year Reviewed 
[.1' TRITON THIES SPORTS EDITOR BOB GORBY 

While others may feel that 
UCSD's deemphasis of athletics 
is bad, I teel that it is highly 
successful. While an outstanding' 
athlete undoubtedly finds it fru s-
trating to compete against small 
colleges and to rely heavily on 
the drive and Interest or his 
teammates, I feel that the UCSD 
athletic policy is well-suited to 
most students here. 

At a small college such as 
UCSD, an extensive Intra murals 
program is especially suitable 
and important. That is precisely 
what we have here. 

Unde r the capable supervision 
or Andy Sidef, the best times 
at UCSD are to be found on the 
basketball courts, the baseball 
and football fields, in the pool, 
the handball courts, a track meet, 
and so on- -practically inde-, 
finately. 

Where there's interest, there's 
Andy Skief trying to get people 
together in an organized fashion. 
Uncountable forfeits become 
games to be made up, for to 
Andy Skief a game not played 
is a great deal of fun that has 
been missed. 

The 1968-69 year witnessed a 
maturing UCSD intercollegiate 
program. 

We sent our first team to a 
national small college final this 
year, when the Triton volleyba 11 
team took third pIace In the 
nationals. 

Football was added to the list 
of intercollegiate sports. Their 
first year went much as expected-
-the new team was here to learn 
and improve, and not to win. 
Although they gave Cal Tech its 
first win in four years (in a 
34-31 game), the football team 
did turn in a creditable season 
and they should be more success-
ful next year. 

I say should be because foot-
ball has been cancelled for next 
year. Another aspect of the 

maturing athletic program here 
at UCSD was focused when many 
of the fo otball players demanded 
certain things from the Univer-
sity. Certainly the athletes here 
at UCSD have a hard time keep-
ing up with studies, athletics and 
in many cases jobs too. 

The athletic department, how-
ever, saw this boycott by the 
athletes as a possible transgres-
sion against their "anti-big time 
athletics" pollcy, and the de-
mands of the athletes were voted 
down. The result is that UCSD 
still had its conservative "ant!-
big time" policy but now it has 
no football tea m. 

The basketball team made it 
big this yea r, be ing one of the 
three independent teams in our 
area to make the NAlA (small 
college) district playoffs. Arter 
the loss of our starting center, 
an Inexperienced Jefr Mill and 
treshman Steve Waddell stepped 
in to keep the team winning. 
The unexpectedly good perfor-
mances by these two helped tie 
the team together , and big guns 
Ed Babuich, Dave Kiefer and 
Bob Desjardines maintained the 
team's scoring punch. 

In their fir st playoff game, 
however, as Coach Neil Stoner 
said, "Unfortunately we saved 
our worse half of the year for 
the playoffs." That Tritons came 
s torming back after a bad fir st 
half to tie the game in the second 
half, only to lose the game In 
the final minute. 

Then a second blow to the UC-
SO athletic program came when 
basketball coach Neil Stoner 
moved on to a better job at 
another school. 

Jay Segal and Jay Gillette were 
the big guns on this year's cross 
country team. The team had a 
successful season, which attests 
to the hard work that the team 
members put in. 

Crew was among the other suc-

cessful sports this year, alone 
with wrestllng and volleyball 
(which heads the list by takinc 
third in the N AlA nationals.). 

The other intercollegiate 
teams had a good time wbUe 
perhaps not such a good sea-
son. But this is to be expected 
at a university that pIays doft 
the athletic aspect of education. 

The strong point of this uni-
versity's athletic program is that 
they have more intercollegIate 
sports than most small colleges. 
The chance to improve or learn 
is there for any student who has 
the interest, and the time each 
athlete spends at his chosen 
sport(s) is vir tually up to him. 
The only drive is personal in-
terest. 

This does not make for big 
time athletics or even winning 
teams, but it cRles make for a 
good time. And to the teams 
that do win, so much more is 
credit due them, for it is the 
dedication, work and drive of 
the team members that produce 
the victories. 

Sportswriting for the Triton 
Times has been a harrowing 
experience. When I have had 
what I considered an important 
sports story, I would find that 
there was no room for It. Then 
when my protests earned me 
plenty of room in the paper, 
the Triton sports world would 
hit a dead week and I would 
not have enough articles. 

But sportswriting for the 
Triton Times had allowed me to 
get aquainted with the UCSD Ath-
letic Department and the people 
who make it run. That In it-
self has been a highly rewarding 
experience . 

Under the friendly , capable 
hands of the people in the UC-
SO Athletic Department I am sure 
the Triton athletics will always 
be a worthwhile experience and 
that the program will never 
far wrong. 

Hunt Looks at Past Year 
by Howard Hunt Director of Athletics 

Seventeen intercollegiate 
teams participated during the 
1968- 69 year. 

For the first time national 
recognition was received by se-
veral teams: 
1. Volleyball 

In only its second year of 
competition the UCSD volleyball 
team qualified tor the national 
playoffs of the NAlA and took 
third at George Williams College 
in Illinois. The Tritons qua-
lified by taking first in the first 
annual NAIA District III, Area 
I, championships, which were 
held on our campus. Two Tri-
tons were selected for the na-
tional All TournaI lent team, 
Kerry Klostermann 31dDick Rei-
therman. 
2. Basketball 

UCSD made the District III 
playoffs of the NAlA, for the 
first time, in an hCtiVity that 
has the highest le\ el of com-
petit10n of all in )istrict III. 
3. Crew 

Crew did very <lie 11 In the 
light we ights in its second year 
of competition. We 'i Ided three 
teams with the Ught \telghts com-
Ing in third in the Western Re-
gionals 8's, and surprised all 
by taking tirst In the light weight 
4's. 

ew activities introduced Into 
the intercollegiate program this 
year were gymnastics (men and 
women). soccer, fencing and foot-
ball. These new activities wlll 
undoubtedly continue to grow and 
we look for more competition 
next year. 

One of the new activit1es was 
dropped under current con-
ditions , this being football. A 
lack of interest on the part of 
students to compete under the 
existing circumstances at UCSD 
prompted this action and the 
nine game schedule for 1969 was 
cancelled. Football will become 
part of the program at such time 
when the students at UCSD show 
interest in adding this activity 
to the schedu Ie of events again. 

Interest Is increased In most 
of the other activities and with 
the completion of additional fa-

cilities, such as the track and 
baseball diamond, more student 
athletes will be encouraged to 
participate in the future. 

For 1970, two of the Triton 
teams will compete in special 
conferences in District III with 
an opportunity tor champion-
ships. These are rugby and soc-
cer. Further Inte rest in rugby 
will be stimulated by the great 
competition expected. One mem -
ber of the 1969-70 rugby team 
w111 be selected for an all-star 

continued on p. 15 

Sports at UCSD have come 
a long wa y this year. There 
have been many disappointments 
as well as excitement, which 
typities intercollegiate a.ction. 

The main sporting event of 
the year though, was tbe duel 
concerning the direction our ath-
letic program is taking. At 
times, the ferocity of the par-
ticipants matched some of UC-
SO's contact sports. 

One II tea m" felt that as long 
as athletes were taking time 
out to represent UCSD, they 
should get some sort of finan-
cial aid so they wouldn't have 
to work during study time. The 
opposing side was· against this 
idea, because they felt it would 
put UCSD on the road to "Big 
Time" athletics. 

Even though tbe UCSD students 
have decided by reterendum what 
the athletic policy wUl be, I 
feel compelled to sum up this 
year's sports activity and prove 
once and for all that we are 
on the right road, athletically. 

Take the fall season, for exam-

pie. While the four teams (foot-
ball, water polo, soccer, and 
cross country) didn't win NAIA 
championships, they provided a 
real challenge to the participants, 
and excitement for the fans. 

Highlights of the fall season 
were; the cross country team's 
outstanding performances, the 
first football game (complete with 
cheerleaders and peanuts) at 
home, the soccer team's vast 
Improvement over their long and 
hard season, and the noticable 
increase in teamwork among the 
water polo team. The weather

But the best was yet to come. 
The winter sports season pro-

NY Soloists 
Found Dull 
I, Richr" G ....... 

DtsappoIaI:bIc is tbe word for 
Jut 'I'1IIrsdaJ's performaace by 
tbe New Yon: Cbamber Soloists. 
They were generally dull aod 
coovent1ooal, despite tbe in-
Clusioo at a "Cantata on EIi&a-

.betban Texts", by Bugb Aitken 
(1958). Unfortunately, this work 
was tandsbed by an overly-
zealous teoor wbo forced his 
mirth and good bumor to tbe 
point of qlpl'essiveoess. 

Through the rest of the eveD-
1Dg, the performers merely bid 
bell1Dd the shadows of the great 
composers. They seemed to 
feel privileged to present un-
lDspired reDdittons merely be-
cause most audiences will ac-
cept Mozart or Beethoven in any 
form. Predictably, the audience 
slumbered through a nice, tidy, 
acceptable Mozart piano cpi3rlet 
(Eb major), then gave a nice, 
Udy, acceptable applause. A 
Haydn trio fared better due 
mainly to tbat oddity, tbe 
harpsichord. Its tinkling neftr 
falls to amuse even the most 
callous, and in combination wUh 
ceDo and Dute here, it was es-
pecially pleasurable to hear. 

The OIIIy real excitement 
came from Vivaldi's "Concerto 
in G Minor", for f)ute, oboe, 
violin, ceDo and barpslcbord. 
II was skillfUlly executed aod 
smoothly bleDd.M, and can OIIIy 
be fautted In the very bad use 
tbat was made of tbe pause be-
tween movements. Properly 
executed, the pause in Barocpe 
music should be a time of anti-
cipatioo and preparatioo for a 
complete ebaDge in temper-
meat. lDstead, it was simply 
ased as a ebanee for them to 
turn pages, cough, aod other-
wise amuse themselves •••.

DuriIIC tbelr Ilrst American 
tour, the BerUa PbilharlDCllic 
Octet wU1 IlAM!U' at Sherwood 
HaD, La Jolla, 011 Thursday, 
November 2. The performance, 
sponsored by the UoiYersity 
of cautoraJa, San Diego Com-
mittee for Arts and Lectures, 
wiD beQD at 8;30 p.m. 

CODCert tickets are $3.00 for 
the geDeral pubUc' and $1.00 for 
UCSD students aod can be pur-
chased from the Arts and Lec-
tures Office 011 the UCSD cam-
pus, 453-ZOOO, eneusion 139L 

The Octet is made up of mem-
bers of the famoos Berlin Phil-
harmooic Orchestra, which 
made several tours in the Unit-
ed states, tbe last one being in 
1965 wben 17 major cities 
throughout the couotry acclaIm-
ed their performances during 
a limited five-week tour. 

Tbe late musieaI director of 
the Berlin' Philharmonic, wn-
belm FurtwaeDgler, felt that 
thIs eJlSemble was weD-quali-
fied to perpetuate tile traciWoo 
of his famous orchestralnGer-
many and abroad. Tbe Octet 
has performed throughout Eur-
ope with frequent awearances 
at the music festivals in Lu-
cerne, Vienna, Edinburgh and 
Salzburg. 

With a Iarge repertory, the 
Berlin Philbarmoolc Octet also 
has the distiDCtiOll of many 
composWoas by sucb famous 
composers as WDdemith, Hen-
ze, Blacber, HartJe and otbers, 
beIne dedicated to them. 

Members 01 the Octet wbo 
wU1 perform In the local c0n-
cert are Alfred MaIeeek, vio-
lin; Rudolf Hartmaon, rioUo; 
U1rleb Fritze, viola; HelDrteh 
Majowska, ceUo; RaIDer Zep-
perUz, doable bass; Hertlert 
staehr, clarioet; Hans Lemke, 
bassooa and Gerd Seifert, born. 

The f1Dal work was tbe un-
forgivable blaspbemy. From 
the masterful. total "Cantata 
189" of Bach, they toot the 
Uberty of playing OIIIy the in-
strumental and tenor portions. 
Bach's cantatas exist only as 
unified entitles and are not 
subject to editing. The Cham-
ber Soloists sacrificed unity for 
brevity; diversity and richness 
for convenience (in not bring-
ing the necessary performers).
