Hunt urges end to interns

has recommended that the

Campus Intern Program - be 
discontinued next school year. 

handbook. 
Neither Schneider, Harris 

' nor Leifer is happy with the 
proposed deletion of the intern 
program. "It just goes to show 
you that no matter how hard 
you fight, the Student Affairs 
administrators pull the strings. 
They see any attempt to build 
up the AS and student represen-
tation like the intern program 
just as a threat to the control 
they've enjoyed for a long 
time." 

Leifer said no Student Affairs 
administrator supported the 
intern program. "No adminis-
trator stood up and put 
pressure on the Vice-chancellor 
(Hunt) for this program 
because it's not a priority item 
for them . Instead it's a 
program totally for students, to 
teach them about the adminis-
trative structure."

Volk considers 
legal recourse 

UCSD basketball player badly 
Injured from punch In game 

by Steve Gould 
Sports Editor 

UCSD Athletic Director Judy Sweet will meet this afternoon 
with University of California legal counselors to decide what 
recourse Triton basketball player Peter Volk should take as a 
result of a punch thrown in last Saturday night's game, the Triton 
Times has learned. 

According to Sweet, Volk intends to file criminal charges 
against Azusa Pacific College's Mike Berry, who struck Volk in 
the face during an NAIA District Three Southern Division contest 
in the UCSD Gymnasium. "Since Peter might have permanent 
physical damage, he needs to protect himself. If he (Volk) had 
bounced back in let's say three days, the matter would have been 
dropped," stated Sweet. 

After being knocked down attempting to draw a foul , Berry, a 
6'7" senior from Costa Mesa , ran to midcourt where he 
subsequently hit Yolk just below the right eye with his fist. 

Yolk was taken to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla via 
ambulance, treated for a fractured cheekbone and received ten 
stitches above his right eye and along his nose . Further 
examination earlier this week by Scripps doctors has revealed 
Yolk must visit a specialist for possible surgery on his cheekbone 
and nerve damage to his right eye , which is still completely 
swollen shut. 

Yolk also plans on filing a legal suit against Berry for the

"Won't tolerate it" 
In addition to potential 

criminal charges, Berry has 
been suspended for the 
remainder of the season by his 
coach, Cliff Hamlow. Azusa, by 
winning the game (the regular 
season finale for both schools) 
91-71, qualified for a berth in the

Strum: Stalking baboons-insights 

by Alan Runell -
Editor 

Dr. Shirley Strum, UCSD Anthropology 
Professor, believes that one measure of her 
success as a physical anthropologist is that, 
co People don't remember me - they 
remember my (studies 00 baboons." 

Toward this end Strum has taken pains to 
play down the romantic aspects of ber work, 
that of the comely young woman striking out 
into the wilds, and has instead concentrated 
on the field studies, and the ramifications 
thereof, themself. 

That Strum, and her work, seem to have 
been recognized by the "outside ' world", 
might be seen by her inclusion as ODe of five 
eminent speakers lecturing in tomorrow's 
one day symposium entitled "The Roots of 
Humanity." 

The symposium, beld at the Town and 
Country Convention Center, will delve into 
man'l pa.t and future, and features the 
lectures of Dr. Carl Sagan, Director of the 
Laboratory for Planetary Studle., Dr. Mary 
Leakey, wbo alona with her bUibaDd Dr.

separate periods of study. During this time 
Strum documented hunting patterns in 
baboons. 

Though predatory behavior had previously 
been witnessed in baboons, the notion - the 
very development of systematic hunting 
patters in baboons, was seen as "revolution-
ary" is many aspects. 

Strum witnessed, among other things, 
baboons "cooperating" in hunting prey. 
Graduating from a stage where individual 
males would chase a prey in any direction, 
sbe saw baboons begin to chase the prey 
toward other baboons. This development of 
hunting patterns in baboons was " very 
surprising", as it was thought that only 
chimps (who are seen as being "close" to 
humans - with all other animals "far down 
the line") and bumans displayed such traits. 

The new hunting patterns were also seen to 
develop and promote other fonns of troop 
bebavior, Including increased communica-
tion and even the sharing of food. These and 
other developments occurred over a rapid 
period - aimilar to the kind of change. some

pay homa,e to, is an upti,ht, 
nervous gent who likes to keep 
his distance from those seated 
on his left, and who is at liberty 
to insert a funny story in any 
lull in the conversation. He 
prefers guests he's comfortable 
with, guests who obey all the 
sanctions of the Tonillla Sbow 
decorum: be interesting, but 
not profound; be funny, but 
don't upsta,e Johnny; and 
follow the conversational bread 
crumbs that Carson drops. 
Carson frequently refers to 
staff notes for the questions, 
asks very feneral questions 
that read I ke one of those 
II Most Asked Questions" 
government pamphlets, and 
when he knows something 
about the topic, such as 
astronomy whenever he 
interviews Carl Sagan, he'll 
rephrase an answer or delve 
into a tangent that has little to 
do with anything ("Tell us 
about black holes and quarks, 
Carl. ") The patter is very light , 
the humor obvious, being a 
little more than slicker 
variations of cocktail party 
wise guyism. 

More annoying than Carson 
is Merv Griffin, who's goal in 
life is to let the world know how 
many famous people he's 
acquainted with . Griffin 
comes on like an explosion 
waiting to happen, bobs up and 
down like a little boy who's 
watched his sister get un-
dressed through a keyhole, and 
relays jokes that lead nowhere. 
With guests, especially those 
who are telling stories of the old 
days and how they were 
involved with a Show Biz 
Legend, one can depend on 
Griffith to break in with a long 
reminiscence about how he 
came within five feet of the 
same person, including every 
pointless detail. Griffin seema 
to use hiS show in order to seU 
himself, and sadly, millions 
line up for the product thou,h 
it's obviously a rank slice of self 
gratifying bile. 

Phil Donnahue fares a little 
better inasmuch as he demons-
trates a real interest in the 
subjects, which are television's 
quintessiential method for 
handling "controversial" 
topics. He loses points however, 
because he relinquisbes the 
interviewer'S duty to ask 
questions no one else would ask 
by opening up phone lines to 
audience members who ask, 
usually, gratuitous inquiries. 
Donnahue as well seems more 
fitted to the role of peace-
maker, since the one lhing he 
seems really good at is re-
phrasing someone's potentially 
provocative point or question 
into a bland, liberal, bleeding 
heart rhetoric that defuses the 
content . This leaves his 
audience with the impression 
that the iasue at hand is really a 
matter of pOlite, palatable 
words . Hubert Humphrey 
COUldn't have done better. 

Tom Synder of the Tomorrow 
Show is admirable for his 
breaking all the talk show 
rules. He never uses notes, 
preferrin, instead to win, ' an 
interview, and he refuses to 
plu, books or films . 

Synder , however , Is an 
arro,ant aubole with more 
chubpab than lubatance. After 

... ---------__________________________ ..1 he announces who his guests 

are at the show's outset, he 
segues, or jumps rather' into a 
story of something that 
happened that day to bim, and 
like Griffin gives every IOwhat 
incident, and at the end gives a 
big bro-ha-ha laugh that the off 
camera crew Joins in like a 
chorus of unseen Ed Mc-
Mahons. Snyder, as well, is in 
his best form when he has a 
guest he can treat like a 
drinking buddy, with the two of 
them exchanging shop talk 
amid self-satisfied chuckles 
and Snyder's constant cloud of 
cigarette smoke. With more 
serious guests, Snyder is more 
tactful, but still employs his 
improvisatory leeway to the 
max. as evidenced by his 
frequent insertion of off the 
wall questions, his insensitive 
jocularity, and his obsession of 
not letting his more intelligent 
guests develop an idea so 
complex that it can't be 
sandwitched between com-
mercial breaks. In general , one 
gets the idea that Snyder is out 
to prove that a news room 
veteran can have as much 
personality as any other celeb . 

David Frost has little going 
against him. When involved ith 
a show biz extravaganza, he 
plays to the level it's aimed at, 
while still maintaining a 
dignity (he'll never take a pie in 
the face), and wifh the 
weightier matters, he rises to 
the task. His recent Nixon 
interviews prove this, in which 
he did a hard hitting session as 
penetrating as anyone could do, 
including Mike Wallace. Frost 
is the man for all seasons . 
Though not particularly 
charismatic, he does the job to 
the best of his ability . The lack 
of personal magnetism, 
perhaps is the very thing that 
makes him a bearable com-
modity. 

Finally, Dick Cavett, the 
heartthrob of those who think 
that the fine arts ou,ht to be 
subsidized by the Federal 
Government, should get kudos 
for keeping honest conversa-
tion alive in a medium geared 
towards "cool" personalities 
and "cool", easily di,estable 
tripe. His PBS show, a half hour 
five nights a week at eleven, 
has the better writers , play-
wrights , actors, artists, 
scientists and other top notch 
intellectual talent on board, 
and Cavett conducts his 
interviews with an uncommon 
intelligence and wit. 

The Cavett show, thouih, is a 
blatantly elitist affair, exuding 
an attitude of briqing "cul-
ture" to the masses, seemio, as 
though Cavett and crew were 
doing them a long overdue 
favor . While one has to admit 
that Cavett brin,s people to the 
tube who wouldn't normally be 
accorded tbe lpace, the context 
of the show - PBS, a station, as 
the stigma ,oes, watched only 
by people who koow that Henry 
.tames was a writer, oot a 
trumpet player - places the 
pro,ram 10 thin atmOlphere, a 
space accorded to the overly 
bright where they can play 
learned parlor ,ames and 
pretend the rest of the world 
does not exist.

ETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Gov't can protect little man 
Editor. 

In reply to Troy Carter's letter in 
the Feb. 22 issue of the Triton 
Times. we wish to specifically 
address his discussion of a,ricul-

meaningful when the benefits can 
be reaped by all, not only the power

guarantee that everyone'siDterelts 
at least be considered. 

Mr. Carter's claim that food

naive. for he falls to reco,nize the 

true power of monopolies. Once 
food production is in the hands of a 
few. prices will rille as has already 
happened with tomatoes. Since this

Editor: 

Recently, several letters have been written protesUng certain ads as 
"offensive" becauae these ads have been placed by allegedly violent 
or,anizations (CIA and the Navy) . I (eel there is a far ,reater violence

IDclucllng the prevalence of ads usine IleX as a selling point, is far more 
"offensive" In my mind. For althoueh a ,roup may kill thousands of 
people, that people can and will persist as long as they have their minds 
free of shackles. I am speaking of an assault upon our miDd., a scheme to 
bend and corrupt the true and pure morals and ideals which are natural in 
all mankind. 

~n this spirit, I feel that the Yoturt Affair ad appearln, in the 2/22/71

Abortion 
discussion 
Editor: 

Since it surfaced as a campus 
issue at UCSD . I have closely 
followed the letters . editorials. 
cartoons . and news coverage in the 
Triton Times surrounding the 
abortion controversy. 

Over the months I have sensed 
that th e ideal upon which a 
university should be based. that is a 
decision making process involving 
open-minded scholarship . has 
somewhere been trampled upon by 
vehement pro and anti-abortionists 
shouting invectives at one another. 
The heart of the issue, the lives of 
human beings. both father . mother 
and child is what we must focus on 
and not fashionable idealistic 
conjecture. 

The issue is of such importance 
that all of us should be fully aware 
of both sides of it. Consequently, I 
would encourage each individual to 
take advantage of a,1 information 
sources to assist them in making a 
well-founded and intelligent 
personal opinion . 

On Wednesday, March. at 7: 30 
pm in USB 2622 the UCSD Human 
Life Committee will sponsor a 
Discussion of the Medical . Legal , 
and Ethical Aspecta of Abortion 
featuring Burton Shamsky -
Attorney . Fran Schroedl - San 
Diego Pro Life Lecturer. and Joan 
Patton - Registration Fee Trustee. 

Regardless of your current 
poSition. or lack of one. plan to 
attend and listen . think. question 
and decide. .

Nationally ranked San DieJo 
State UniverSity, by far the 
toughest opponent UCSD will 
face this season, handed the 
Tritons a 15-2, 15-6, 7-15 and 15-1 
setback in a non-conference 
volleyball match Wednesday 
night at the UCSD Gym. 

Thf! loss to the Aztecs , who 
defeated national power UCLA 
last week , dropped UCSO ' s 
overall season record to 5-4 . 

Serge of momentum 
SDSU began the match by 

executing perfectly in every 
way with crisp serves, pictures-
que sets and accurate and solid 
spikes . After winning the first 
game, the visiting Aztecs ran 
out to a 10-0 lead in the second 
game and never looked back. 
UCSD rallied for six straight 
points in the second of four 
games but SOSU took the last 
five points to end the Triton 's 
threat. 

UCSD's surge of momentum 
in the second game, however, 
continued through to the third 
game as the Tritons won their 

the punch wa not discussed . 
But, Cunningham added, " The 
league needs a review board 
(for violence) . Everyone thinks 
of avoiding it. I did not want to 
overreact but several times 
this year things could have 
broken out." 

Cunningham referred spec-
ifically to an altercation 
between his starting guard 
Bart Bradley and a Cal Baptist 
player last month which could 
have developed into a serious 

only game of the match . Coach 
Randy Stevenson seemed 
disappointed as the Triton's 
intensity fell lax after the third . 
game. 

Scholarships 
Stevenson, reflecting on the 

match, said the Aztecs " are 
undoubtedly a much better 
team with six members owning 
full scholarships." He noted 
SDSU just had registered a win 
over UCLA and that luckily, 
SDSU is in a different division 
of competition than UCSD and 
the Tritons will be in the 
running for the playofCs in their 
own division. 

One of Stevenson's major 
goals is to install a high degree 
of pride in his team so as to 
create an "angry appetite for 
winning . " The hunger and 
appetite was there Wednesday 
night in the third game of the 
match. 

UCSO resumes play next 
Tuesday night with a non-
conference match against 
Grossmont College a t UCSD. 
The first game is at 7: 30 pm.

'TIIIMI' 

by Jill LoIIt.e Bueley 
AI1I .rUer 

The production of "West Side Story" at 
Bellville'. Dinner Theatre is a real shame 
because it features two very good perfonners in 
the lead roIea of Tony aDd Maria and .urrounds 
them with practically all the ineptitude and 
banality a professional theatre possibly could. I 
would rather see a high school production than 
this ghastly saccharin tablet of a show. There, it 
can be reasonably expected, the thought and 
money given the show is limited enough to 
preclude the kind of mushy flummery that a 
theatre like Bellville's will add to a sentimental 
musical like "West Side Story." 

I refer most specifically to the first 
"SOf11ewhere" reprise, how it is handled and 
how' it wrecks the show. "West Side Story" is 
about the antagonism between two New York 
City street gangs, the Jets, from Eastern 
European families , and the Sharks, Puerto 
Ricans . It tells the tra~ic story of Tony, a Jet, 
and Maria, a Puerto Rican girl, and how their 
love ultimately brings the two rival groups into 
accord. The most beautiful aspect of "WestSide 
Story" is the delicate way in which the 
reconciliation is stated. There are no oaths oC 
eternal friendship, there is no huuing, no 
kissiJli: Tony's dead body is carried away by 
the silent members oC both gangs - that is alL 
And that is enough. 

But in the "Somewhere" reprise, long before 
the end of the play, director Ernest Sarracino 
has the whole company, Sharks, Jets and their 
girls, stretched across the stage holding hands 
while they sing the song. Behind the actors the 
cyclorama is lit up in ugly psycadelic reds and 
oranges. In front of them are Tony and Maria. In 
this one scene sentiment is plopped on so thickly 
that the play just turns into mush. There is 
absolutely no need for insipid gestures like 
hand-holding in this play. Furthennore, the 
program doesn't even mention this scene at all. 
The only "Somewhere" listed is sung by 
Consuelo, and Consuelo, whose name signifies a 
male, is, according to the cast list, played by a 
woman, an the woman, Nanon Tygett, is a fine 
dancer, but sbe doesn't sing a solo anywhere In 
the show. 

Tbe dancinC, like the treatment of sentiment, 
is aiBo a critical iuue is "West Side Story", but 
in thil production It ia characterized by "not 
enoup" rather than "too much." Tbeprologue 
i. slouped over and turns into a farce .-it has 
no direction, no eneJ"l)' . I'm not sure how much 
reworking choreographer Pepper Clyde did, but 
certainly all the cooiness of Jerome Robbin's 
original choreography is lost. Likewise, the 
"Dance at the Gym" is unfocused and weak. 

Another distressing thing about this "West 
Side Story" is that all the Puerto Rican woman 
except Maria are made up and dressed to look 
like whores. If there's a Puerto Rican 
community in San Diego, surely it should have 
something to say about this . I do "agree that these 
particular characters might dress more 
flamboyantly than the others, but there are 
boundaries of taste, and they are crossed here. 

The good things about Bellville's "West Side 
Story" are three actors: Marc Garrett as Tony, 
Karen Hartman as Maria and an energetic 
Bruce Nielsen Winant as A-rab. Unfortunately, 
Garrett's microphone had interference in it all 
evening, but in spiteÂ· of it, he proved himself an 
excellent singer and actor, as did Hartman 
whose upper register is extremely clear and 
beautiful. Garrett and Hartman alone pull off 
this production. Whenever they are on stage, the 
tendency towards lack of focus and sickliness is 
instantly abolished . Their perfonnances are at 
once delicate and penetrating. 

Winant, in the humorous side of the play, is 
delightful in the "Officer Krupke" number. His 
rich baritone distinguishes him from the rest of 
the men, and his sense of comedy makes 
"Officer Krupke" one of the most successful 
numbers in the show. 

Finally, since Bellville's is a dinner theatre, I 
feel obliCed to say something about the dinner. I 
skipped It. I've eaten there twice before and I 
know better now. I did order a strawberry 
dacquiri at intermission but was very 
disappointed. Once, the Bellville's dacquiris 
were made from rum, vermouth, strawberries 
and lime juice. But there was something wrong 
with the dacquiri I had. I drink to fOl'let, and you 
see, I didn't forget "West Side Story" is a bad 
prodUction.
