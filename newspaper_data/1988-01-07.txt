Union 
battle 
beats up 
By LETICIA VILLARREAL 
St~J Writer 

Tom Canty, a UCSD student 
and a maintenance worker at the 
UCSD Medical Center who is a 
member of the California Edu-
cation Labor Organization 
(CELO), claims that he has been 
the object of hostility of some 
American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal Employ-
ees (AFSCME) members and 
has been harrassed and threa-
tened with physical harm by Luis 
Montielh, another maintenance 
worker and AFSCM E repre-
entatlve. 

Canty requested from and was 
given permission by hospital 
ad mini trator Jim Ohneforg to 
olicit signatures at the hospital 

cafeteria at lunchtime for CELO's 
petition that lists complaints 
again t AFSCME, the union that 
presently ha exclusive bargain-
ing right systemwide for UC 
clerical, patient care, and main-
tenance employees. Canty was 
also tryirtJ" Tm"Uit -hospitat, 
employees into the ranks of 
CELO, a member-controlled 
labor cooperative founded by 
UCSD employees in 1982. 

On Nov. 24, 1987, Canty set 
up a table with information on 
CELO and was taping the CELO 
logo on a waH when, he says, 
Montielh came into the cafeteria 
and yelled, ". don't want that 
stuff here!" Montielh then tore 
the CELO logo off the wall. 
Canty says that he "immediately 
went overto the personnel office" 
and reported the incident to 
Henry Coker, who was filling in 
for Ohneforg at the time. 

Coker assured Canty that he 
would "just go over and 
straighten things out" with Mon-
tielh, confident that he would be 
receptive to him because he had 
"known Luis for a while." Coker 
then asked Montielh to come 
into his office to discuss the con-
flict with CELO and Canty. 
Montielh allegedly refused, and 
said, according to Canty "You 
know what? This guy [Canty] 
here - if he tries to put his stuff 
up, he's going to be one dead 
white boy!" 

Afterwards, Coker called 
ecurity and had someone posted 

by Canty's side on Nov. 26, as he 
wa once again distributing 

ELO flyers and oliciting sig-
natures in the cafeteria . Canty 
claims that on that day he tried 
to patch things up with Mon-

International Fifth 
College inaugurated 
By PETER MESSROBIAN 
l'tI ... ~r 

UCSD's Fifth CotIege was 
inaugurated last night at a recep-
tion attended by several San 
Diego City Council members as 
well as members of San Diego's 
international community. 

Councilwoman Abbe Wolf-
sheimer welcomed the guests, 
which included Dr. Roger 
Revelle, Councilman and Mrs. 
Ron Roberts, Councilman Bruce 
Henderson, and Councilman 
Bob Fllner. 

Chancellor Richard Atkinson 
then spoke briefly, and remarked 
that "the college system has 
served us well. We've reached a 
point in time where we've had to 
expand ... Of course, Fifth Col-
lege is in context with UCSD's 
efforts to focus on international 
relations. " 

Atkinson also noted in an 
interview the importance of 
developing support in the com-
munity for the new college . 
"Over the long haul, it is impor-
tant for people in the business 
community to know about it so 
students are recognized when 
they graduate," Atkinson said. 

Harriet Marsh, the new dean 
of Fifth College, described the 
inauguration as an "opportunity 
for community people to get 
involved [with Fifth) ... we 
invited people we hoped will 
become acquainted with Fifth 
College. 

Jamie Lyon, the provost for 
Fifth, described a main focu of 

the college as pushing its stu-
dents to spend some time abroad. 
either studying or working. "We 
worry about ethnocentrism ... 
They [Fifth's students] will not 
be studying international rela-
tions . .. they will go on with an 
international focus." 

In an interview, Vice-Chan-
cellor for Undergraduate Affairs 
Joseph Watson said he was 
excited about the new college. 
"[The college adds] more choi-
ces, we feel that's what is impor-
tant about UCSD," Watson said. 
"We're broadening our appeal as 
a campus ... " 

The most distinctive aspect of 
Fifth's curriculum is a required 
six-quarter lower-division 
sequence entitled "The Making 
of. the World," which will 
"encourage students to think his-
torically, comparatively, and in 
an interdisciplinary manner 
about both Western and non-
Western cultures," according to 
a college brochure. 

Other course requirements 
include learning a foreign lan-
guage, completing a series of 
courses focusing on a particular 
geographic area, a fine arts class, 
natural science and math / com-
puter science / symbolic courses, 
and an upper-division writing 
course. 

Afler Atkinson and Lyon 
spoke, Lyon and Councilwoman 
Wolfsheimer presented cer-
tificates of Special Recognition 
to everal representatives of 
international organization 
located in an Diego. [Q]

T-REG 
• coming 

toUCSD 
Reach out 
and register 
for classes 

By PORSCHE SHANTZ 

Beginning on Tuesday, Feb. 
16 through Saturday, Feb. 20, 
the UCSD Office of Admis ions 
and Registrar will offer a new 
enrollment service called T-R EG, 
or Telephone Registration. 

This first enrollment period 
on the sy tern will be for senior 
(who attained senior status by 
fall '87) for spring quarter 1988. 
The registrar's office hopes to 
have the feature available to all 
students in May 1988 for the fall 
enrollment. 

Students will be able to sign-
on to the y tern from any touch-
tone phone using a personal 
access code (PAC) that is unique 
to every tudent. 

"Touch-tone telephone regi -
tration will be an efficient and 
time-saving process for students," 
said Ron Bowker, registrar and 
admis ions officer. "The system 
will a sist in accurate course 
election; check cullege. major, 

and level course registrations; 
then confirm course selections. 
The average time to register 
should be about five minutes," 
he added . 

"The system is patterened after 
the Versateller-type systems that 
banks use today," said Sally 
Hickok-Broxton , associate 
registrar and admissions officer. 

"It's a service we've been want-
ing to provide to students for a 
long time," Hickok-Broxton 
added. "and the funds just now 
became available ." 

"The new ystem is the latest 
in tate-of-the-art enrollment 
procedures used across the coun-
:ry," she said. Very few universi-
ties in the nation have this sys-
tem - among them are Brigham 
Young University, Georgia State 
University, and the University of 
Texas. 

During the trial enrollment 
period, students using T-REG 
will be given priority although 
seniors who opt not to use T-
REG can turn in standard enrol-
lment forms on Feb. 18. 

Seniors will be shown an 
instructional video tape prior to 
the T - REG enrollment period. 
Copies of the tape will also be 
available for on-reque t viewing

New exhibit opens . 
at Fleet Center 

Embodying the universal network of 
systems that make up our world, the 
new science exhibit. "Systematica," 
will open at the Reuben H. Fleet 
Space Theater & Science Center on 
Jan. 16. It is the first in a series of tra-
veling exhibits launched by the 
Exhibit Research Collaborative 
(ERC). 

The Fleet Science Center is one of 
eight cience centers in the nation that 
are pooling resources and expertise in 
the ERe. Their purpose is to keep 
pace with the demand for science 
exhibits incorporating state-of-the-art 
technology and to develop outstanding 
educational exhibits that travel to 
other museums within the 
colla borative. 

The first in this series. "Systemat-
ica ," was developed by the Museum of 
History and Science in Louisville, 
Kentucky. This exhibit discloses our 
world as a multitude of systems and 
features a live ant farm as one exam-
ple. It will be at the Fleet Science Cen-
ter through Feb. 15 . 

"Systematica ," which communicates 
visually and interactively the results of 
a scientific approach to understanding 
the world of systems. is divided into 
several themes: organization , interac-

tion , rules and regulations, cata~­
trophes, stalemate , cycle~ , growth and 
diversity. 

A ~ystcm , simply defined, is a set 
who~e numbers work together accord-
ing to rules . The ant farm is presented 
as an example of a system that oper-
ates under the principle of hierarchical 
organization 

The fleet ' clence Center is cur-
rently working on t heir own contribu-
tion to the ERe. Their series of exhib-
liS , titled "About Faces," will allow 
visitors to use their own faces to 
explore the obvious and hidden wond-
ers of the human face and how it uni-
versally communicates emotion. 

Since "Systematica" will be featured 
in the lobby of the Space Theater & 
Science Center, there will be no charge 
for the exhibit. The Space Theater & 
Science Center is open from 9:45 am 
to 9:30 pm daily. For more informa-
tion, call the Science Center at (619) 
238-1233 .

and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev . Accords resulting 
from the meeting called for the encouragement and 
development of "contacts, exchanges and cooperation in the 
fields of natural science, technology, humanities and social 
sciences, education. cu lture, and in other fields of mutual 
interest. .. 

UC officials first. discussed an exchange program with 
Soviet officials in 1986. In November of that year and twice in 
1987 separate UC delegations visited the Soviet Union to 
negotiate the agreement. Merkur'yev and his colleagues 
visited the University of California for final negotiations in 
December. 

The exchange program will begin in the summer of 1988 
and continue for three years. Among the areas of particular 
interest to be pursued under the program are mathematics 
and physics, language and culture, and education. Student 
and faculty participants will be drawn from throughout UC's 
nine-campus system. 

Some provisioAs~ the program: 
• Asmany as 32 UC undergraduate and graduate students 

a year, 16 per semester, will attend Leningrad State University 
for Russian language study. 

• As many as five graduate students from each university 
will be exchanged for one academic year in fields other than 
language. 

• As many as 10 undergraduate students from each 
university will participate in a three-week exchange program 
during the summer. 

• As many as 15 professor~ from each university will be 
exchanged for up to two months, four months in special cases. 
They will conduct research, give lectures, participate in 
conferences, and serve 01'1 delegations for coordinating 
programs and discussing results of cooperation between the 
universities, such as the publication of joint research projects 
and the exchange of literature and educational materials.

teria representing AFSCM E. "I 
was about to leave," Canty said, 
"and I said [to Montielh), 'Well, 
I'm out of here - it's all yours ... 
By the way, my name's Tom,' 
and I held out my hand and 
[Montielh) says, 'Listen, I'd just 
as soon kick your a-- as I would 
talk to you! Don't f--- with 
me!' ., 

Canty said that a police report 
was filed on Nov. 24 in which he 
described Montielh's alleged 
behavior. 

Canty added that he had also 
experienced hostility from other 
AFSCME members. He main-
tains, however, that he has 
received a lot of support from 
rna ny of the hospital employees 
and was told by one that she was 
glad that "finally, there's people 
standing up to AFSCME." 

Montielh had no comment 
about the incident and Canty's 
allegations, and he claimed that 
he didn't know who Tom Canty 
was. 

Michael P. Melman, UCSD 
Labor Relations Manager, said 
that his office represented "the 
university in its dealings with a 
number of [labor) organiza-
tions ...

those." [Q) 

Exchange 
Continued from page 1 

• As many as six researchers 
from each university will be 
exchanged for up to 30 months 
to conduct scientific and educa-
tional research. 

A comparable program exists 
between the State University of 
New York and Moscow State 
University. It began in 1974. 
Leningrad State University, with 
an enrollment of 15,000, is one of 
the Soviet Union's three leading 
universities and the country's 
foremost university in the study 
of the physical sciences. 

The UC program would be 
administered by the University's 
Ed ucation A broad Program 
(EAP). EAP provides opportun-
ities for students to study for a 
year at 70 host institutions in 28 
countries. Nearly 1,200 UC stu-
dents are participating in the 
program. 

Two UC students currently 
are studying Russian language at 
Leningrad State University, and 
two more are scheduled to attend 
in the spring, under a coopera-
tive program administered by

Berkeley, other 
universities to 
explore stars 
By WALLACE RA VVEN 

BERKELEY - The world's 
largest array of telescopes de-
signed to detect millimeter-
length radio waves emitted dur-
ing the birth and dying stages of 
stars will be developed by three 
universities, it was announced 
recently. 

The Berkeley-illinois-Mary-
land Array, named forthe three 
state universities sharing in the 
project's development, will 
detect the shortest radio waves 
in space with a resolution neces-
sary to discern structures about 
the size of our solar system. 

The new development will 
double to six the number of 

radio telescopes now operated 
in a grid by the University of 
California, Berkeley's Hat 
Creek Radio Observatory near 
Mt. Lassen in northern Cali-
fornia. It will also add powerful 
computer facilities to process 
new observations made there. 

The cooperative research ar-
rangement was announced by 
the participants: UC Berkeley; 
the University of Illinois, Cham-
paign-Urbana; and the Univer-
sity of Maryland College Park. 

By adding three six-meter 
telescopes to the Hat Creek 
grid, the consortium will 
achieve a five-fold increase in 
the speed with which the instru-

A lot of us are standing in the 
wings watching the current 
chancellor rape our campus. We 
work here and live near here, or 
we once in a while get to visit the 
ca mpus because we live some-
where el e across town or in the 
nation . We are the original van-
guard class of John Muir Col-
lege . Over the last three months 
we've compared notes with one 
another and this is what we say 
to the whole campus through 

one perso n: IT I TI ME FOR A 
EW CHA CELLOR . Period . 
He 's got the sa me bulldozer 

mentality that James Watt once 
displayed . There is no envi-
ronmentally-sensitive person in 
the driver' seat around here 
anymore. There is a person who 
takes down the trees with blatant 
disregard for the posterity of our 
nation. The man is a fool to do 
what he does. He especially dis-
regards the wishes of those 
around him and from that overt 

gesture comes the seed . It is time 
for new blood on the front lines . 
The folks running the show are 
ruining the tranquility of the 
campus through ill-planning. 

These words may not sit well. 
however, they are the truth . 
People are sick with what ha s 
been taken down by the bull-
dozer, and they want it stopped. 
Thank you.

now that it just might be anti-

Oh, he's coming to visit? How

Why? What do you mean why? 
Don't you remember? The

doing pretty well . 

Gimme a break, it's my vaca-

to II during my vacation, then I 
will. It's not my fault you feel the 
need to get up at 6 every morn-

Well , don't snap at me then! 
Now what? 
Oh , for crying in the gutter, 

my stuff is supposed to be on the 
floor. Why put it away when I'll

International Communications Regimes 
Inst: Drake Code 1580 MWF 11 :00-11 :50 UH 109 

International regimes are "rules of the ga me" negotiated by states to govern 
coopera tion and competition in global issue-areas . For a va riety of reasons. such 
multilateral framework are particularly critical in the field of internatiollal 
telecommunications and infor mation transfer. This course will examine the principal 
regimes in global communications. emphasili ng the impact on them of the intense 
interna tional conflicts engendered by the post-war information revo lut ion and 
American and corporate demands fo r the liberalization of globa l regulations. The 
course begins with an examinatio n of the nature of international regimes , and of the 
theorie used to explain their creation. evolullon and change. It then a sesses some 
of the key technological. economic and political trends that have made regime 
cooperation difficult in recent years. 

Against this theoretical and hi torical backdrop. the cou r~e exa mines in detail the 
following cases: the telecommunications regimes under the aegis of the International 
Telecommunication Union. which govern both international networks and services. 
and the alloca tion of radio frequencies and satellite orbital >Io t ~ ; the regime 
administered by the International Satellite Organi13tion to provide global ,atellite

KGB's music director 
plays to a full house 
By REBECCA JAURIGUE 
Staff Writf!r 

" I 'm going to get a call 
from Michael Hutch-
ence of INXS," Pam 

Edwards recently reminded the 
switchboard operator while en 
route to her office. "You'll know 
it's him by the Australian accent! " 

Not the usual business call, 
but as music director for San 
Diego radio station KGB-FM 
(101.5), Edwards takes calls like 
that all the time. 

Leading the way through the 
KGSstudios, Edwards explained 
that the lead singer of INXS was 
calling in for a radio interview to 
promote the new album release 
" Kick. " 

Posters of David Bowie, The . 
Cruzados, Tea rs for Fears, and 
Peter Gabriel adorn her office 
walls. Countless tapes and CD 
are piled on a table among press 
releases and glossy photographs. 
LP line the shelve . On the wall 
next to a world map hangs a 
black frisbee with "The Hooter .. 
emblazoned on it. A hugejar full 

of Tootsie Rolls decorates the 
desk . Edwards sits behind while 
discussing her work with "the 
number-one rock radio stat ion 
in San Diego." 

Although Edwards has only 
been with KGB a little over a 
year, she tarted in radio as a OJ 
and program director at WPG U-
Champaign , University of lIIi-
nois. "I was a total rocker in col-
lege," Edwards aid . " I mean, 1 
have different ta tes. My favor-
ite band is U2, but I also love 
Iron Maiden . I know, it ounds 
ridiculous!" 

After co llege graduation in 
1979 she moved to California, 
landing a job on the production 
staff of the now-defunct K MET. 
During her three years with the 
prominent Los Angeles rock 
radio station, Edwards began to 
work on the air a nd eventually 
was promoted to music director. 

On her position as music 
director at KG S, Edwards aid, 
" I get to add new records, give 
awa y new albums, interview 
band . I also act as the lias on 
between the radio s tation and 

the record com pa nies." 
She continued, "I a lways pro-

duce remOte broadcasts , say 
from the Sports Arena. You need 
to get clearance from the manag-
ers , make sure the band's going 
to stop by and what time, who's 
going to escort the band , how 
long they'll talk, what they don't 
want to talk about ... Some-
times, it sounds really easy .. . 
Sometimes, it's a major hassle; 
even so mething as simple as 
ordering scratched records -
well , that has to be done." 

Dealing with bands is the most 
enjoyable aspect of her work . 
"Not in a 'groupie' sense at all ," 
Edwards said . "So many times, 
especially as a woman, people 
think in those terms. If you're 
sincere about the music - the 
artistry and expressio n - that's 
where it's at ." 

Edwards discussed some of 
the highlights of her radio career 
so far. "One of the most power-
ful interviews I did was with Jim 
Kerr of Simple Minds. He was 
articulate, exciting, passio nate.

He talked about his marriage 
with Chrissie Hynde and a lot of 
issues. like Amnesty Interna-
tional and Greenpeace." 

I n addition to her responsibili -
ties as music director, Edwards 
hosts her own show every Sun-
day from 8-9 pm - "Vinyl 
Frontier," a venue on the air-
waves for new music. Her show 
has features such San Diego 
recording artists as the Paladins, 
Private Domain, and Robert 
Vaughn and the Shadows. 

Edwards said that KGB pro-
motes the local music scene, in 
other ways as well . For example, 
they sponsor shows and concerts, 
such as last summer's " Street 
Scene" and "Rock Wars." 

"There's promise in San Diego. 
Bands see other people make it, 
and that's always a great incen-
tive," Edwards said. "We are out

night. That helps the bands that 
play there because KG B is so 
powerful." 

KGB presents both new and 
class ic rock , unlike other stations 
that are not as diverse. Broad-
casting for the past 15 years from 
Kearny Mesa, the musica l amal-
gam proves successful at KGB. 
Last year, KGB was named the 
third-best radio station in the 
nation by the annual Rolling 
Stone Reader's Poll . 

By changing with the times, 
KGB's music stays familiar and 
yet innovative. According to 
Edwards, most of the DJs at 
KGB have been with the station 
for many years, showing a com-
mitment to play what listeners 
want to hear. 

"[KGB] is not so formatted." 
Edwards remarked . "Sure, we 
sti ll pla y Lynard Skynard and 
Led Zeppelin, but we also go 
into R.E.M . and The Alarm ."

Remaining true to the lively 
spirit of rock-a nd-roll , Edwards 
referred to the power of KGB.

KABUKI 
MACBETH 

Shozo Sato's lGJbuId M:Jcberh is a spectacular blend of 
two distinct theatrical traditions. Using Shakespeare's 
themes and characters. the Elizabethan text has been 
abbreviated to accommodate the classical Japanese 

elements of stylized gesture, ritual dance. make-up and 
puppetry. This production is a stunning display of 

theatrical values reflecting the richness of 
Shakespeare's language.

" The Landinx Pit,?" Edxarcown , " by Jane Peterson 

Painting by gender 

T he San Diego Museum of Art is one of only four museums in the country which will be showing the inaugural exhibit of the new 
National Museum of Women in the Arts which 
opened last spring in Washington, D.C. The 
paintings which have been culled from this new 
museum are presented to San Diegans in a show 
entitled, "American Women Artists 1830-1930" 
which runs through Jan. 31 in Balboa Park. 

The more than 100 paintings and sculptures are 
organized in the museum by category - portrai-
ture, genre and history, landscape, still life, and 
sculpture - rather than chronologically, to give a 
sense of scope and variety to the works achieved 
by women during this century. As a result, the 
exhibit stresses variety over any IOrt of artistic 
movement, or parallels to men's work, durina the 
same period. 

Organized as such, the show provides a more 
than adequate sampling of the work of women 
artists (rom the last century. Showcawd are 
famous paintings by well known artists such as 
Georgia O'Keefe's "White Trumpet Flower" and 
Mary Cassatt's "little Oirl in a Blue Armchair," 
as well as newly discovered works by lesser known 
artists like Jean MacLane. 

Because this exhibit tries to encompass such a 
large area - to cover a century of women's art in 
an exhibit of only upwards of 100 works is no easy 
task - viewers expecting to get an in-depth view 
of women's work in this time frame will probably 
leave the show with their appetites unsatiated . 
The only way to get a full perspective on the works 
would be to travel to the original museum in D.C. 
- an option which really isn't too plausible. But 
aside from the show's ambitiousness the exhibit 

by kristen mccleary 
f(aturea editor 

fares well through the diversity of the works 
presented. 

Landscapes range in scope from Lilla Cabot 
Perry's "Giverny Landscape in Monet's Garden" 
(Monet was a neighbor of her during the 10 
summers she spent in France as well as being an 
obvious influence on her painting) to Georgia 
O'Keefe's "City Night," a portrait of skyscrapers 
which she painted from her view on top of the 
Shelton Hotel in New York in the suite she shared 
with Aldred Steiglitz. 

If one ·tries to uncover a female sensibility in 
these paintings, they'll most likely come across 
more contradictions than conclusions. While 
Sara Miriam Peale's many portraits show her sub-
jects as kind, soft-expressioned, upperclass peo-
ple, Ellen Emmet Rand's portrait of Henry James 
shows the writer posed in darkness with an 
expression that is more suggestive of mystery and 
sorrow than serenity or mirth. 

It is true that many of the genre paintings are 
primarily of women and children, capturing scenes 
of everyday life with great imalination and detail. 
However, such subject matter can be easily 
explained by the fact that the home was where 
most of the women were relegated to spending 
their days. Yet it is not true that they were never 
travelers and always confined to the hearth. 
Besides Cabot's painting in Giverny, France, the 
exhibit boasts paintings of life in India, Italy, 
Tunisia and the Philippines. 

It is also evident that wClmen artists did not rival 
men in their output of historical paintings, nor in 
the landscape tradition of panoramic views. Again, 
this can be explained as a matter of social circum-
stance for unlike men, most of the women artists 

did not make a living from their paintings. As a 
result , they painted primarily what interested 
them rather than what would sell. There were, 
of course, exceptions to this. For example, Lilly 
Martin Spencer sold her work to help support her 
large family . 

How a woman who gave birth to 13 children 
found time to paint as much as she did (68 of her 
paintings were previously shown at the National 
Museum of American Art) is perhaps the only 
question of gender which is not discussed by the 
curators who organized this show. 

The sculptures on display stand to dispel the 
myth that women are incapable of accomplishing 
artistic feats which require great physical strength . 
Harriet Hosmer and Margaret Foley are two 
internationally acclaimed artists whose works are 
exhibited. Hosmer's life-size "Sleeping Faun," is 
reminiscent of the work of another great Ameri-
can artist, Nathaniel Hawthorne, who is said to 
have used Hosmer as the model for his story "The 
Marble Faun," which is about two female artists 
working in Rome. 

Overall, the "American Women Artists 1830-
1930" profits more from its great diversity than it 
loses in spreading itself too thin. A problem which 
does arise from being categorized as a "women's" 
art show is that these works will be valued for 
their worth as products from a certain segregated 
group rather than for a value inherent to the pieces 
themselves. While the sex differentiation can help 
account for the prevalent daily-life subject matter 
of many of the paintings, this show proves that the 
techniques and quality of the artist varies no more 
from man to woman than it does from painter to 
painter.

Matera's 
my.stery 

by robert leone 
hiatul writer 

Despite the leftist female 
protagonist. the San Francisco 
law school setting, and the 
current time period, Lia Mat-

and an editor of the Malhousie 
Law Ret/iew. She begins to 
investigate as other editors are 
systematically killed with blunt 
instruments. 

The death toll among the 
logical suspects is incredibly 
high. In fact, if the reader 
wishes to figure out before the 
heroine who did it, just look 
for the one character who isn't 
killed, and who disappears 
from the storyline for about a 
hundred pages. 

Matera is Agatha Christie 
wearing modern clothing. This 
work is well-crafted (witti-
cisms drop left and right, and 
it's internally self consistent), 
but it's not brilliant and new. 
Still, for mystery fanatics, the 
plot is smooth enough and 
complicated enough. If you're 
looking for a captivating book 
with which to waste a few 
hours, you could do worse 
than Where Lauryers Fear To 
Tread. It's out in paperback. 

As we begin the new year, it 
is an age-old tradition to look 
back and pick out the best that 
the preceding year had to offer. 
Music is no exception, and 
1987 delivered numerous 
brilliant alb!Jms ranging from 
superb comebacks to an excel-
lent finale. However, 1987 will 
probably be best remembered 
as the year that the college 
market bands broke into the 
big leagues. The following is a 
list of the 10 quintessential 
albums of 1987. 

Once thought of as a 
college-oriented anthem rock 
band, "The Joshua Tree" has 
catapulted Ireland's U2 into 
star status. Spanning Third 
World torture and empty 
success, "The Joshua Tree" 
highlights the incredible abil-
ity of U2 and leaves you 
knowing that their best is still 
to come. era's murder mystery, Where r------------------------

1. The Replacements -
"Pleased To Meet Me" 

4. Sting - "Nothing Like 
the Sun" 

Quite possibly the most 
talented single musician in 
music today, Sting has dem-
onstrated once against that he 
can make great music on his 
own. Choosing a softer and 
more dramatic tone than his 

See MUSIC, page .. 

Lawyers Fear To Tread , is a 
throwback to the Golden Age 
of mysteries. 

In this mystery, there are no 
hardboiled gumshoes and no 
Sam Spade trying to discover 
who "offed" his partner. 
There's a tough cop, but he's 
merely a foil for our heroine, 
who is a raw school student 

With the release of "Pleased 
To Meet Me," their fifth and 
best produced album to date, 
the Minneapolis quartet has 
proven that rock and roll can 
still be fun. Their latest effort 
is a collection of pure and 
unadultered rock anthems and 
ballads that makes one wonder 
why other bands can't make 
music this good.
