As of Oct. 16, surgeons at the 
UCSD Health System performed 
their 3,000th pulmonary thrombo-
endarterectomy, a life-saving surgery 
developed by the UCSD Medical 
Center in 1970.

This is an important milestone 
for UCSD doctors because patients 
who require PTE surgery suffer from 
severe pulmonary embolism, which 
are small blood clots that form in the 
lungs. According to the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, it 

typically affects 300,000 to 600,000 
Americans annually, but a small 
minority may further develop scar 
tissue and chronic thromboembolic 
pulmonary hypertension. The condi-
tion leads to shortness of breath and, 
eventually, heart failure.

PTE is a procedure established by 
Doctor Kenneth Moser and a team 
of UCSD cardiothoracic surgeons to 
successfully clear this scar tissue.

Over the course of several hours, 
the patient is put on a cardiopulmo-
nary bypass machine to clear the 
lungs of blood, allowing surgeons to 
work on the arteries. Additionally, 
the patient’s body is chilled to 18 
degrees Celsius to protect major 
organs during the main part of the 
surgery, which places the patient 
under cardiac arrest. While the sur-

State Supreme 
Court Demands 
Inmates Released

CALIFORNIA

California’s Supreme Court has refused to consider 
Gov. Jerry Brown’s appeal of an order to reduce prison 
populations in the state. Brown will have until Jan. 27 
to meet a court-ordered population cap mandating the 
release of over 9,000 additional prisoners.

The state’s push for prison reform began in 2011, 
when a federal court demanded that California improve 
prison health conditions. In April 2013, the Supreme 
Court of California gave Brown 20 days to come up with 
a plan to reduce the number of inmates or be held in con-
tempt of the court. Brown’s initial plan included releasing 
certain inmates and sending others to county prisons in 
order to lessen the pressure on state prisons, which cur-
rently hold inmates at up to 149 percent of capacity.

Releasing the additional prisoners will bring state 
prison overcrowding to 137 percent of capacity. Brown’s 
plans may not add up to the mandated 9,600 prisoners 
that need to be released, and the court can order the 
release of more prisoners on top of its first mandate.

Brown petitioned the initial order to release inmates 
by December of this year, asking for an additional three 
years to meet the court’s requirements. The mandate was 

California has until Nov. 10 to 
reduce prison crowding from 
149 to 137 percent capacity.

SAN  DIEGO

Filner Pleads Guilty on Battery Charges

Former San Diego Mayor, Bob 
Filner pleaded guilty to a felony charge 
for false imprisonment and two mis-
demeanor battery charges on Tues., 
Oct. 15, reaching a plea deal with 
the city. He was accused of forcibly 
restraining or making sexual advances 
toward three women against their will.  
His sentence included mandatory 
mental health treatment, three months 
home confinement and three years 
probation during which he cannot 
vote, serve on a jury or possess fire-
arms. In addition, he cannot run for 
office again and will lose his may-
oral pensions from the date of the first 
accusation until his resignation. If he 
violates these sentences, he could serve 
up to six months in prison.

Filner, 71, resigned in late August 
after 18 accusations of sexual harass-
ment were made against him. However, 
he agreed to resign under the condi-
tion that the city pay for his legal fees in 
civil cases. His former fiance, Bronwyn 
Ingram, left him in July due to his 
sexual advances on other women.

The women he committed false 
imprisonment and battery against 
were identified as “Jane Doe 1, 2 and 
3” in reports. Filner violently held back 
Jane Doe 1 with what is now referred 
to as the “Filner headlock” on March 6 
at a fundraiser. The first misdemeanor 
occurred on April 6, when the former 
mayor kissed Jane Doe 2 against her 
will at a “Meet the Mayor” event. On 
May 26, Filner allegedly grabbed the 
buttocks of Jane Doe 3 at a Fiesta 
Island rally. 

The former Freedom Rider served 
as mayor for nine months and was 
San Diego’s first democratic mayor 
in 20 years. During his resignation 
speech, Filner called himself the victim 
of a “lynch mob,” explicitly stating that 
he was never a perpetrator of sexual 
harassment. A mere six weeks later he 
pleaded guilty to the charges. 

The guilty plea comes a month 
before the special election for Filner’s 
replacement. Former UCSD profes-
sor Nathan Fletcher leads the polls 
with 4 points over Kevin Faulconer, 
with David Alvarez and Mike Aguirre 
at 20 percent and 8 percent of the 
vote, respectively, according to U-T 
San Diego. 

The former mayor ended his political career Tuesday in a plea deal for his false 
imprisonment and misdemeanor charges and will not serve any jail time.

BRIEFS by    Danielle  Bulante  Contributing  Writer
▶ UCSD Welcomes Albert P. 
Pisano as Dean of Jacobs School 
of Engineering

On Sept. 1, UCSD welcomed 
Albert P. Pisano, a noted mechani-
cal engineer, educator, entrepreneur 
and administrator as the new dean 
of Jacobs School of Engineering.

Pisano previously served 30 
years at UC Berkeley as professor 
of mechanical systems and director 
of the Berkeley Sensor and Actuator 
Center. 

He received the school’s highest 
honor, the Berkeley Citation, for 
his contributions to science and 
technology.  

During his time at UCSD, 
Pisano hopes to expand undergrad-
uate programs that give students 
the opportunity to gain practical 
experience in the engineering field.

“I’m working with everybody 
— the community, the companies, 
the faculty and the students — to 
really take this up a notch and really 
make an engineering degree from 
the UCSD Jacobs School not only 
a degree of deep engineering fun-

damentals but also of strong engi-
neering application,” Pisano said in 
an interview with Jacobs School of 
Engineering.

▶ UCSD hosts National 
Engineering Forum

On Oct. 10, UCSD partnered 
with the National Engineering 
Forum to hold collaborative discus-
sions where engineers could address 
persistent problems in their field.

The forum brought together 
industry, government, media and 
academic leaders to San Diego to 
evaluate how the United States’ 
engineering programs compete 
with those of other nations.

“UC San Diego is working to 
ensure our next-generation lead-
ers have the knowledge, skills and 
visionary leadership to tackle com-
plex global challenges and increase 
our competitiveness on the world 
stage,” UCSD Chancellor, Pradeep 
Khosla said.

In the upcoming months the 
NEF will continue to meet in top 
schools around the nation to dis-

cuss the solutions to problems that 
modern engineers face.

▶ Chancellor Khosla reassures 
students of the affordability of 
college

Last week, UCSD Chancellor 
Pradeep Khosla visited Clairemont 
and Mission Bay high schools in 
an effort to reassure students of the 
affordability of college. 

His visit was part of the sec-
ond annual “Achieve UC” event, a 
program that encourages students 
from lower income backgrounds 
to attend UC schools. During his 
speech Khosla told students that 
UCSD provides about $350 million 
to those who are in need of finan-
cial assistance.

Khosla hopes to encourage 
more students to attend college 
throughout the year by expanding 
the Chancellor’s Associates Scholar 
Program, a program that provides 
needy students with up to $40,000 
over four years. 

“We should be sending every 
qualified kid to college, period, 

regardless of which family they 
come from,” Khosla told U-T San 
Diego on Oct. 17.

▶ William Ogdon, founding chair 
of the music department dies at 
the age of 92

Composer William Ogdon, the 
founding chair of UCSD’s depart-
ment of music died at the age of 
92 on Oct. 6. Ogdon often encour-
aged students to deviate from ear-
lier 20th century music and explore 
their own ideas. 

Under his direction, the depart-
ment received an international 
reputation for being a center for 
experimental music.

His legacy continues to thrive as 
former students distinguish them-
selves in their educational and com-
positional careers.  

He is survived by his wife 
Beverly, daughters Bethany and 
Erica and son Benjamin. In honor 
of professor Ogdon’s memory, 
UCSD will hold a memorial concert 
on Nov. 2 at 3 p.m. at the Conrad 
Prebys Music Center.



instead extended to mid-January 2014.
The governor had previously peti-

tioned to eliminate federal oversight 
of California’s prisons, and stated in 
a Jan. 2013 press conference that the 
state should be allowed to run its own 
system.

“The prison emergency is over 
in California,” Brown said. “We’ve 
reduced over 43,000 [inmates]. People 
act like nothing happened. Billions and 
billions have been spent. We’ve shaped 
up; we’re standing at attention; we’re 
ready to go forward. I’ve taken their 
own expert, and I’ve made him head 
of corrections. So what more do they 
want?”

The administration has also been 
turning to for-profit prisons to house 
additional inmates, including one in 
California City, which will cost the 
state $28.5 million per year to operate. 

Federal judges have blocked Brown 
from sending prisoners to private pris-
ons outside of the state.

Michael Bien is the lead counsel for 
mental health in Coleman v. Brown, 
one of two cases aimed to compel 
Brown to comply with the court’s 
orders.

“This is an extremely significant 
ruling, in that Governor Brown and 
California have been fighting the order 
of the three-judge court to reduce the 
prison population,” Bien said. “The 
prison system and California are not 
complying with the people.”

The University of California 
Student Administration has offered 
its own solution regarding California’s 
prison problems. The organization 
is sponsoring Invest in Graduation 
Not Incarceration, or IGNITE, and is 
aimed at easing laws that result in long-
term prison sentences for nonviolent 
drug offenders, as well as suspensions 

for students accused of willful defi-
ance. The UCSA website calls willful 
defiance an overly broad and arbitrary 
rationale that results in suspensions 
and expulsions.

The court that ordered the pris-
on population cap said in April that 
Brown and his administration bla-
tantly defied the mandate.

“California still houses far more 
prisoners than its system is designed 
to house,” the judges said. “At no 
point over the past several months 
have defendants indicated any will-
ingness to comply, or made any 
attempt to comply, with the orders 
of this court.”

If Brown’s administration fails to 
comply, the court has threatened to 
release thousands of prisoners early 
next year.

geons quickly clean out the scar tis-
sue, the patient has zero heart and 
brain activity. Afterward, the patient 
is warmed and revived;  they stay 
in the hospital for two weeks before 
being released.

Dr. Nick Kim, head of the PTE 
and pulmonary critical care pro-
grams, oversees the diagnosis, evalu-
ation and aftercare of patients that 
come in, as well as clinical trials for 
improving CTEPH treatments.

“Patients can come in very short 
of breath, almost dying from their 
condition,” Kim said. “And within 
two weeks, they can have a new life.” 

People suffering from CTEPH, as 
well as practitioners from Germany, 
France and the UK, come to learn 

from UCSD’s globally renowned staff.
“[The job] has its challenges, 

but it’s very gratifying to see these 
patients, who are nearly dead, come 
and get life-saving treatments,” Kim 
said. “Also, we’re very fortunate to be 
in an educator position where we’re 
actually out there teaching other pro-
grams how to diagnose and treat 
these patients.” 

Only a few places in the world 
successfully carry out the difficult 
PTE surgery. Furthermore, as a lead-
ing expert in the field, the UCSD 
Medical Center reported a post-
operative mortality risk of only 1 
to 2 percent with its procedure, as 
opposed to the typical 5 to 7 percent, 
depending on a center’s experience. 
This is attributed to the high vol-
ume of patients that our doctors see, 

allowing them to perfect their meth-
ods. UCSD is responsible for the vast 
majority of the total PTE surgeries 
ever performed, often taking in sick-
er, more challenging patients that 
were turned down by other centers.

UCSD’s PTE program was 
th  e first to be a nationally des-
ignated Center of Excellence by 
the American College of Chest 
Physicians. 

“UCSD should take great pride 
because this is a surgery that was 
pioneered here in our backyard,” 
Kim said. “There’s a lot of local pres-
tige and reputation that comes with 
being leaders in this disease.”

WikiLeaks 
Is Necessary 
For A Free 
Society

With the release of WikiLeaks’ documentary “Mediastan” on Oct. 11, 
I thought it necessary to reiterate 
the importance of WikiLeaks in a 
free society. The film raises press-
ing questions about the regulation of 
global media and the importance of 
freedom of information. WikiLeaks 
and affiliated whistleblowers have 
recently been getting considerable 
flak from federal governments. Cases 
such as that of Army Private Chelsea 
Elizabeth Manning, born Bradley 
Edward Manning — a U.S. soldier 
convicted to 35 years in prison and 
dishonorably discharged for releasing 
classified documents to WikiLeaks 
— and the Edward Snowden scandal 
have drawn intense government scru-
tiny. Former Secretary of State Hillary 
Clinton, for example, claimed that 
WikiLeaks’ releases are an “attack on 
U.S. foreign policy interests.”

However, WikiLeaks is impor-
tant because it exposes deception in 
government and holds it accountable 
for its actions. WikiLeaks exposed 
PRISM, a National Security Agency 
program designed to collect personal 
information from major compa-
nies like Google, Facebook, Skype, 
Youtube, Microsoft and Apple. Most 
of the information about PRISM, 
including court proceedings, is kept 
confidential, so it’s hard to question 
its constitutionality. Additionally, the 
U.S. House and Senate intelligence 
committees are only exposed to a one-
sided argument due to the secrecy 
of the program. The existence of 
WikiLeaks brought this information 
to public knowledge so that it could 
be acknowledged in the first place: a 
major win for democracy.

Those who support mass surveil-
lance and media censorship believe 
that these actions should be permitted 
so that a nation can protect its citi-
zens. They claim that if the govern-
ment’s actions are transparent, we’ll 
be in danger. However, while national 
security should be a concern, it should 
not take priority over inalienable 
rights. Without a check, like free press 
and WikiLeaks, the government has 
little to stop it from breaching our 
Fourth Amendment rights. 

The Fourth Amendment protects 
American citizens from unreason-
able search and seizure: the reason 
why police can’t just walk into your 
house and search for stuff. By actively 
collecting and storing one’s personal 
information, the government assumes 
that everyone is potentially guilty of 
a crime and should have information 
collected about them. There is a rea-
son we are assumed innocent until we 
are proven guilty: It’s so the burden of 
proof doesn’t lie on citizens to justify 
why they are innocent. 

Freedom of information is 
important because we should be able 
to observe and judge the actions and 
deliberations of our governments 
through what WikiLeaks calls “prin-
cipled leaking” — when a citizen 
leaks confidential documents that 
he/she feels is a breach of inalien-
able rights. As WikiLeaks puts it 
as, “Open governance is the most 
effective method of promoting good 
governance.” Unfettered information 
is necessary so those in power don’t 
abuse it, and WikiLeaks offers an 
unprecedented opportunity to check 
authoritarian tendencies and expose 
government misdeeds.

QUICK  TAKES RECENT COLLEGE GRAD ROB RHINEHART’S NEW INVENTION “SOYLENT” IS A CHEAP, CONVENIENT FOOD SUBSTITUTE THAT CLAIMS TO HAVE “ALL THE NECESSARY NUTRIENTS” IN A FLAVORLESS POWDER.

Although the original purpose of nutritional 
drink Soylent as a product is quick appetite satia-
tion, its true value lies in its applications for the 
needy — as a tool to provide an emergency food 
source. While the product is not designed to be a 
full-time substitute to meals, it could serve as a via-
ble option for times when there is no other choice.

Soylent’s nature as a cheaper, supposedly bal-
anced food substitute could help bring food secu-
rity and crucial nutrition to struggling individuals 
and families. In 2011, one in six Americans faced 
hunger, and 17.9 million households faced food 
insecurity, which means that they lived in hunger 
or had the fear of starvation. In a wealthy country 
of approximately 300 million people, these numbers 
are far too high. 

Additionally, Soylent can be relied upon as a 
tool for emergency relief. In developing nations that 
lack the social or physical infrastructure to handle 
large natural disasters or famine, this product could 
prove incredibly valuable. Unlike other emergency 
rations that are meant to provide only basic suste-
nance, Soylent would also maintain proper levels of 
nutrition in those using it. Because it doesn’t spoil 
like regular food, it could be stored for long periods 
of time. The money saved by using Soylent instead 
of traditional relief food could be put towards 
addressing other consequences of a disaster. 

In short, Soylent’s founders have a real gem 
on their hands. But instead of trying to radically 
change the way well-to-do people perceive food 
and nutrition, their main focus should be geared 
towards people in poverty or governments seeking 
alternative solutions in emergency relief.

Bland Substance Can’t Replace the 
Cultural Value Behind Real Food

Emphasis on Convenience Marks a 
Shift in Food’s Former Role in Society

Soylent Should Be Utilized as an  
-NÅKQMV\�)QL�NWZ�0]VOMZ�:MTQMN

As college students, thrift and convenience often 
guide our eating habits. Founder Rob Rhinehart 
experienced this type of diet in college and invented 
Soylent for our busy demographic. With over 10,000 
backers contributing $1 million to the start-up com-
pany, Soylent’s emphasis on convenience over taste 
illustrates food’s shifting role in our lives.

Rather than the time-consuming process of 
preparing and savoring meals, consumers now seek 
low-effort, low-cost food that refuels their bodies 
with utmost efficiency. Journalist Eric Schlosser 
notes in his book “Fast Food Nation: The Dark 
Side of the All-American Meal” that the fast food 
industry grew 1000-fold in less than three decades 
for exactly this reason; people value their time and 
money more than eating 21 quality meals per week.

Soylent and fast food both capitalize on this 
shift toward convenience over culinary artistry, but 
Soylent takes this idea to its logical extreme. In a 
society where the International Food Information 
Council has to report 56 percent of Americans 
skipping breakfast, even fast food isn’t fast enough. 
Soylent seeks to fill these gaps, occupying a new 
niche even fast food cannot satisfy. Unlike fast food 
manufacturers, Rhinehart tailored Soylent to con-
tain a balance of all human caloric and nutritional 
needs in a day, making it more appealing than fast 
food on the health front as well.

Foods of the future, like Soylent, will reflect the 
public’s demand for even more efficient ways to 
refuel without personal investment in each meal. 
This is a grand departure from traditional dining, 
which emphasized putting time and energy into 
each meal for a quality gustatory experience.

—  THOMAS FINN
Contributing Writer

The creators of Soylent have labeled their 
new experimental form of sustenance — better 
described as questionably nutritious goo — as a 
sort of miracle food. The only thing miraculous 
about it, however, is that it has somehow managed 
to acquire over $1 million of investment funds 
from online enthusiasts.

Asking college students, Soylent’s target con-
sumers, to surrender the savory taste of their 
Chipotle burritos and In-N-Out burgers for a 
tasteless, gloppy substance seems to be a stretch. 
In a first-impression article, Lee Hutchinson of 
Ars Technica describes his first taste of Soylent as 
“chalky,” and like “leftover sediment.” Furthermore, 
in an online poll asking which of their senses users 
would rather forfeit, less than 30 percent of users 
chose taste. This is because taste is not so much a 
biological necessity as it is a biological gift. 

In an online article regarding cravings, 
University of Leeds’ Dr. Andrew Hill explains that 
tastier foods release chemicals such as dopamine 
into the bloodstream, which triggers pleasurable 
feelings. So while this wonder food-wannabe 
boasts an ostensibly outstanding variety of nutri-
ents, the paucity of pleasure to the palate renders 
it as unrealistic as any other “wholesome” meal. 
There are other healthy foods already available, 
and those are inevitably trumped by less nutritious 
options primarily due to taste. 

Although Soylent possesses nourishment nec-
essary for survival, it neglects food’s role in culture. 
Flavors bring more meaning to food than a mere

When the war ended in both Iraq and Afghanistan, American veterans were finally able to return home and reunite with their family and friends. After 
many years on the battlefield, many war veterans are seeking 
higher education and living a civilian life. Over the past year, 
more than 1 million veterans have enrolled in U.S. colleges and 
universities, and in 2012 alone, 600,000 veterans spent $9 bil-
lion in federal education funding. 

For many returning veterans, for-profit universities like 
Kaplan University, Keiser University and the University of 
Phoenix seem like great options. Many veterans are either 
struggling to re-integrate themselves into society or having 
financial responsibilities to support their family. With the 
overcrowding of community colleges, for-profit schools seem 
to be the next best alternative. With aggressive marketing 
techniques and an easy 15-minute application process, for-
profit schools have already received $32 billion in federal 
grants and loans and $7.5 billion in Federal Pell Grants from 
students with federal aid money.

However, for-profit schools should not qualify for govern-
ment education funding, because our veterans deserve more 
than the second-class education that these institutions pro-
vide. Because for-profit schools are governed by profit-driven 
businessmen and the private sector, they exploit war veterans 
through a loophole in the Post-9/11 GI Bill, in order to see 
profits and pay less attention to quality education. 

Many for-profit schools target veterans to boost enroll-
ment rates due to the high flow of funding in the Post-9/11 

G.I. Bill. The Post-9/11 G.I. Bill awards honorably discharged 
veterans with up to 36 months of education benefits, including 
full coverage of in-state tuition and fees, a monthly housing 
allowance and up to $1,000 of financial aid for school-related 
supplies. These benefits are due to revisions of the original G.I. 
Bill that put thousands of veterans in school after World War 
II and fueled America’s postwar economy. However, in these 
revisions, legislators introduced a rule that for-profits use to 
exploit veterans. The 90/10 Rule, under the Post 9/11 G.I. Bill, 
prevents these institutions from taking more than 90 percent 
of their funding from federal student aid, but gives for-profit 
universities the incentive to accept veterans under the G.I. Bill. 
Because they are classified separately from traditional federal 
student aid, veterans are manipulated by for-profits, robbed 
of the educational benefits they earned and left with large 
amounts of student debt.

The core of the problem is that for-profit schools uphold 
a “quantity over quality” policy because they profit based on 
the number of student enrollments, rather than high standards 
of education. Many for-profit schools are run by publicly 
traded education companies such as Education Management 
Corporation and the Apollo Group, who value profits over 
student success. Despite gains of $210 million from the Post-
9/11 GI Bill, for-profit schools still devote less than one-third of 
what public universities spend on students. 

However, it is not hard to understand why our veterans 

See VETERANS, page 5

NICO  HEMSLEY NAHEMSLEY@ucsd.eduJUSTICE   IS   SERVED



would fall into for-profit schools’ trap. 
Unlike traditional colleges, for-profit 
schools aggressively advertise their 
flexible hours, online classes and 
convenient locations as a main sell-
ing point to appeal to veterans. These 
firms spend approximately 20 percent 
of their total net revenue of $1.3 bil-
lion for one fiscal quarter on advertis-
ing and promoting alone. 

Yet for-profit universities set up 
veterans to fail, leaving them with few 
options and a significant amount of 
debt. Veterans who want to transfer 
out of for-profit schools to a tradi-
tional college often face difficulties 
due to their non-transferable units, 
resulting in course completion rates as 

low as 30 percent. What’s worse is that 
according to the U.S. Department of 
Veterans Affairs, the G.I. Bill does not 
fully cover for-profit university tuition 
or expenses for incomplete course-
work. Ultimately, as these students fall 
out of school, they fall into increased 
amounts of debt.

Essentially, for-profit schools 
are exploiting war veterans for their 
financial aid package instead of dedi-
cating resources to improve the stan-
dard of education. Thus, it is impera-
tive for legislatures to stop speculating 
and actually take action. The Obama 
administration increased awareness 
on the exploitation of veterans due to 
the G.I. Bill, but the U.S. Department 
of Education needs to implement 
legislations that will limit federal aid 

money flowing into for-profit schools 
and non-vocational programs. 

Even though the structure of 
for-profit schools have more flexible 
hours and appeal to veterans with 
prior commitments, high standard 
education must be placed as top 
priority. For-profit schools taking 
federal aid money while not provid-
ing quality education are essentially 
scamming and cheating our war 
heroes. While the U.S. government 
cannot interfere with for-profit 
schools’ policies, the least they can do 
is to limit and monitor federal money 
is going to and ensure high quality 
education for our veterans.

INDIA

JAPAN

The nice thing about studying in London is that you’ve already 
nailed the language requirement. All you have to do now is worry about 

making the best of your experience abroad and learning the local slang.
By simply traveling on foot, students can explore many unique attractions 

in this vast city — everything from national landmarks, such as the Buckingham Palace, to 
quaint cafes. Of course, with the fast-paced life, it’s necessary to find a good balance so that 
you won’t fall behind in your studies.

Students can visit London via EAP or through the five-week long global seminar for 
MMW 15,  “History and Culture in London.” Participating schools include London School of 
Economics, Sotheby’s Institute of Art and UC Center London. The GPA requirement for EAP 
spans anywhere from 2.0 to 3.3, and the programs offered tend to focus on art, economics and 
politics. The MMW 15 global seminar allows students to visit historical landmarks, such as 
the City of Cambridge, and attractions like The British Museum. This year, Professor Babak 
Rahimi, an associate professor of communication, culture and religion in the department of 
literature, is leading the seminar. The first information session will be held on Tuesday, Oct. 22 
at 5 p.m. in the International Center Oceanids Pavilion.

For many people, leprechauns and alcohol are all that come to 
mind when considering Ireland. While one of these definitely has a 

strong presence in Irish culture, the academic opportunities that exist 
there are even more notable.

Most UCSD students study in Ireland through EAP, which offers four options. First is 
an Irish immersion program, where students can study in Dublin, Cork or Galway — an 
especially relevant pick for students interested in literature, as they can learn about the heavy 
influence of Irish writers on world literature. For the politician and businessman, two intern-
ships in the Irish Parliament and the Quinn School of Business allow students to apply their 
knowledge in an international work setting, respectively. Finally, a summer program in Dublin 
specifically emphasizes science and engineering, so the science majors can also experience 
Ireland’s verdant beauty while earning 12 UC quarter units.

And of course, you can kick back with a world-class Guinness and Jameson every 
now and then, too.

One interesting fact about Spain is its daily nap period, known as 
“siesta” in Spanish, during which everyone is allowed to return home for 

a short nap. So for those students who experience waves of overwhelming 
drowsiness after lunch, Spain is the place for you.

This summer, UCSD students can study in Spain via the five-week global seminar, 
“Crusaders and Conquistadors in Spain,” led by Professor Paul Goldstein, associate professor 
in the department of anthropology. It will focus on the complex history of Medieval Spain 
around the 1490s.

The seminar will take place in the oldest historical site in Spain, Toledo — also know as 
the City of Three Cultures due to the coexistence of Christianity, Islam and Judaism within its 
walls. Outside of the the four hours of class each week, students can peruse the bustling streets 
filled with family-owned shops selling different food or trinkets. In addition, students can 
choose to explore the various areas of Spain outside Toledo, like the famous Madrid, with the 
extensive bus system.

The seminar offers two upper-division courses for a small class of 15 to 25 students to 
allow students to better connect with their peers and the professor. Information sessions will 
be held on Oct. 14 at 5 p.m. in the International Center Oceanids Pavilion and on Oct. 23 at 5 
p.m. in the International Center Lounge. 

Colors, sounds, spices and people. You could be exploring the Ajanta 
Caves, which harbors history as old as 200 B.C., or visiting the Konark 

Sun Temple and learning about India’s own Sun god, Surya.
With UCSD’s extensive selection of programs, there are a variety of ways 

you can study in India. International Studies Abroad and the American Institute for Foreign 
Study both offer chances to study Indian language and culture in Hyderabad. Also, EAP boasts 
three separate programs in Hyderabad, Pune and the country’s capital  — one of the oldest cit-
ies in the world — New Delhi. Hyderabad, known as the City of Pearls, is home to centuries-
old bazaars as well as modern research institutions. In Pune, students have the opportunity to 
do research or complete an internship following a seminar on social and historical India. 

In a country that integrates both the ancient and the modern world, a study abroad experi-
ence in India is a gem of an opportunity.

For those looking for a perfect blend of fast-paced city life and the 
peace of rich, traditional culture, Japan is the place for you.

The convenient part is that you don’t have to know Japanese to go to 
Japan. Most of the things there are printed in English as well as in Japanese, 

and its citizens have a basic command of the English language. In addition to having one of 
the most reliable train transportation systems in the world, Japan is known for its active night-
life. Students will find anything from ordinary clubs to “Bunny Cafes,” where customers can 
enjoy tea while petting rabbits.

Students looking to study abroad in Japan using financial aid are encouraged to go through 
EAP. Participating schools include University of Tokyo, Osaka University, Keio University and 
more. There are no language requirements for Japan through EAP, but students are encour-
aged to study basic Japanese before they head off across the Pacific Ocean. 

Welcome to the “land Down Under,” where you can take a morn-
ing class about the principles of computer programming languages and 

explore the Great Barrier Reef in the afternoon. Study abroad in 
Australia through EAP or OAP in the coming year, and you’ll have the 

chance to do just that. 
Through EAP, you’ll have the opportunity to study and receive UC credit at many of 

Australia’s renowned institutions, including the University of Melbourne, the University of 
Queensland and the University of Sydney, in subjects ranging from business administration 
to religious studies. OAP offers just as many opportunities, and you’ll be able to earn transfer 
UCSD credit at top-notch Aussie universities, such as the University of New South Wales, 
Australian National University and the University of Western Australia, where courses offered 
vary from computer science to archeology.

Who knows, maybe you’ll even pick up the accent and come back 10 times cooler.

THE GUARDIAN’S GUIDE TO
STUDYING ABROAD

e

T he prospect of traveling to a foreign country in lieu of being stuck on campus year-round — and earn-ing course credit while you’re at it — may seem like 
an enticing, yet far-fetched opportunity. If the thought of 
forking up all that money to cover the steep expenses of the 
trip or the idea of spending all that time applying to differ-
ent programs is disheartening, you may want to reconsider 
your options. Each year, numerous students study abroad 
in various countries, most notably the U.K., France, Italy, 
Spain and China. Though the cost of these global excur-
sions range anywhere from $8,000 for a summer program 
to $30,000 for a full year abroad, financial aid and scholar-
ships can help fund your trip. To give students a head start, 
the Guardian has gathered some practical information from 
the UCSD Programs Abroad Office.

1. Watch the “First Steps” video at icenter.ucsd.edu, or attend one of the “First Steps” information sessions hosted by the Programs Abroad Office.
2. Explore program options. This will help you to determine which program seems most fitting for you in relation to where you want to study, the course credit you 
need, your college curriculum and what you can afford.

3. Start making plans to finance your trip. Look into the different scholarships and grants that you can apply for. Check online at pao.ucsd.edu for a list of scholar-
ship opportunities and deadlines.

4. Meet with a Programs Abroad Adviser for a more in-depth evaluation of your op-tions. The adviser will listen to your needs and recommend the best options.

1. Start researching study abroad opportunities early on in order to give yourself plenty of time to plan for your trip. Usually students need to begin planning six 
to nine months in advance before going abroad.

2. Keep track of all the deadlines throughout the application process. Deadlines vary by program and course of study.
3. Apply for as many scholarships as you can. $500,000 in scholarships are pro-vided for students to study abroad each year.
4.Give yourself enough time to ask for letters of recommendation. If you’re having trouble securing a letter from a professor, it’s alright to ask a TA.

decided, in honor of the launch of 
the new department, to present my 
own Triton Hall of Fame inductees 
from the modern era:

Chelsea Carlisle, Women’s 
Basketball: When I came up with 
the idea to do this list, Carlisle 
popped into my head immediately 
as my number one nomination. A 
four-year starter, Carlisle holds the 
all-time school record for points in 
a single game (46), led the team in 
scoring for three consecutive years 
and was at the forefront of a 26-win 
start to the season in 2011–12. 

Carlisle’s teams were my first 
glimpse at Triton greatness, and 
now, as an assistant coach, I imagine 
it won’t be long before she takes 
home a Triton Award of her own.

Brian McManus, Women’s 
Soccer: McManus is in his 27th 

year of coaching. If that’s not reason 
enough to put him on my short list, 
he’s also a five-time NCAA champi-
onship winner, the winningest D-II 
soccer coach (of those coaching 
10-plus years) and wields a winning 
percentage of over .800 (through last 
year). 

Camille Gaito, Softball: The 
Triton pitcher who won 35 games 
in 2011 has got it all. The winner of 
UCSD’s most recent team champi-
onship had a 0.94 ERA in the 2011 
playoffs, fanned 617 batters over 
four years and finished with 98 wins 
in four seasons to become the all-
time Triton leader in the category.

Nick Howe, Track and Field: A 
former co-worker at the Guardian, 
Howe spent little time in the office. 
Instead, he racked up a resume 
chock-full of championships and 
records, including back-to-back 
national championships in javelin. 

Howe’s picture was in the Guardian 
so frequently that we worried about 
a conflict of interest. Now training 
for the Rio 2016 Olympic Games, 
Howe should easily make a future 
list of Hall of Famers.

Alec Arsht, men’s soccer: Finally, 
I would be remiss if I did not 
include my Jewish contemporary 
Alec Arsht. My only truly personally 
biased pick for this list, Arsht still 
has most of this year to score what I 
predict will be 250 goals, log 10,000 
more minutes and lead UCSD to 
another soccer title. 

Arsht started all 36 games for 
the Tritons his first two years on 
campus and was a starter on Team 
USA’s delegation to the Maccabiah 
games in Israel this summer. 

If he can surpass my very con-
servative estimates of his abilities, 
then he, too, will receive a Triton 
Award.

win after trailing 19–20. Both teams 
fought in impressive rallies with only 
small margins deciding the winner.

 “That was pretty crazy,” soph-
omore outside hitter Sophie Rowe 
said following the fifth set. “My team 
fought really hard at the end of this 
set. These games can go either way. 
Everyone on our side played really 
well; we were fired up and into it. 
Unfortunately, it didn’t go our way 
tonight, but I’m really proud of my 
team.”

Rowe stayed aggressive down the 
stretch and shined throughout the 
last games, recording 21.5 points, 
seven digs and a pair of blocks. 
Together with sophomore outside 
hitter Danielle Dahle, Rowe led the 
team this weekend with 30 and 34 kills, 
respectively. 

Sophomore setter Heidi Sierks also 
had a great weekend, with 105 assists 
and 32 digs for the Tritons. Senior libe-
ro Brittany Lombardi led the defense 
with 47 digs.

The bitter loss to Cal State Los 
Angeles broke the Tritons’ seven-
game win streak, but UCSD (16–3 
overall, 8–3 in conference) remains 
in third place for the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association. The 
Tritons are one game behind sec-
ond-place Sonoma State and three 
games behind first-place Cal State 
San Bernardino.

UCSD is back in action next 
weekend, hosting Sonoma State on 
Friday, Oct. 25, and San Francisco 
State on Saturday, Oct. 26 to open 
the second half of the CCAA season.

before Edwards took over and later 
became the first female president of 
the NCAA.

“Having a Hall of Fame is long 
overdue. It’s massive for the school, 
and it’s going to bring great cred-
ibility to the school when people see 
the kind of athletes and personnel 
that we have,” UCSD women’s soccer 
coach Brian McManus said.

Banners honoring each inductee 
will be hung in RIMAC Arena. Hall 
of Fame members were also given 
plaques — The Triton Award — to 
commemorate the achievement. 

“I think having the banners up 
in RIMAC Arena are going to be a 
great touch for our student-athletes. 
To kind of see the names and accom-
plishments of some of the people that 
came before them is a great step for 
us,” UCSD cross country coach Nate 
Garcia said.

 Any UCSD student-athlete is 
eligible for consideration 10 years 
after they’ve completed NCAA com-
petition, and any former coach or 
administrator can be nominated 
three years after working at UCSD.

No. 1 in 
Zev’s Book: 
My Hall of  
Fame Picks

By popular demand (mainly from my mother), Warming the Bench is back for another 
year of exciting Triton sports com-
mentary.

The timing is perfect, in light 
of yesterday’s inaugural class of 
the Triton Hall of Fame ceremony. 
Eight Triton elites, including for-
mer Athletic Director Judy Sweet, 
received custom-made “Triton 
Awards” at the event (a regulation-
time, two-hour ceremony, which 
extended well into extra innings).

Sweet was honored for her 
accomplishments overseeing the 
first 26 of 30 Triton National cham-
pionships and her 25 years of service 
(between 1975 and 2000) saw the 
program grow from a NAIA baby to 
an NCAA Division II competitor.

On an unrelated note, I believe 
that I will be inducted into the Hall 
of Fame for my record consump-
tion of complimentary orange juice 
at a Triton Hall of Fame induction 
ceremony.

The Hall of Fame, announced 
in June of last year, marks a time of 
change for the department — transi-
tioning from a few scattered smaller 
sports teams as an obligatory after-
thought at a research university to 
the storied athletic program by the 
sea. (I swore to my editor I would 
not write another “I want D-I” col-
umn, but this is where I say that.)

Some of the names on the cer-
emony’s program included coaches 
and players for volleyball, soccer, 
swimming and water polo — though 
all the inductees were, understand-
ably, contributors to the Triton 
dynasty pre-21st century. However, 
because not all of us were fortunate 
(or old) enough to idolize Triton 
tennis star Christine Behrens-
Almeida or soccer All-American Ele 
Johnson-Jones while growing up, I

VOLLEYBALL

T he UCSD women’s volleyball team had mixed results this week, beating Cal State Dominguez Hills last Friday, before dropping a heartbreaker 
to Cal State Los Angeles in a five-set marathon the fol-
lowing night at RIMAC.

“It’s hard to say that I’m not disappointed,” UCSD 
head coach Ricci Luyties said of the weekend. “But for 
every match we play, we get better, so we just have to 
keep going”.

On Friday, the Tritons traveled to Carson, Calif. to 
battle conference opponent Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
The Tritons played consistently and were dominant on 
the attack in the match, which ended 3–1.

“It was a pretty good game,” Luyties said. “Everyone 
played well, and we had a good hitting percentage.” 

The win was the 45th for UCSD in the all-time 
series. The Toros have won just twice, first in 1992 and 

not again until last season.
With a solid home crowd to cheer them on, the 

Tritons were ready Saturday to take on the Golden 
Eagles at RIMAC Arena.

Cal State Los Angeles came out strong to win the 
first set with efficient back-row attacks and solid block-
ing, but UCSD answered the call in the next set with 
impressive digs and good hitting, winning 25–17. Both 
of the teams battled each other during the next two sets, 
alternating wins until the fifth game.

The Tritons had the better start in the fifth set, 
pressuring the Eagles’ serve-receive game. Leading the 
whole set until CSULA tied the game at 13–13, the 
Tritons battled for match point back and forth with the 
Eagles.

Victory slipped through UCSD’s fingers when the 
Golden Eagles stole three consecutive points for the 

UCSD Inducts First Hall of  Fame Class  
HALL  OF  FAME

The UCSD Athletics Program 
inducted its first inaugural class into 
the UCSD Hall of Fame in a cer-
emony in Price Center East Ballroom 
Sunday, Oct. 20.

A panel of UCSD athletics 
administrators, former UCSD stu-
dent-athletes and coaches picked 
the eight-member class beginning in 
June. The first class of inductees was 
announced near the end of August. 

“Today is a special day in the 

history and development of UC San 
Diego athletics,” UCSD Athletic 
Director Earl Edwards said. “We are 
here to celebrate another milestone 
in the growth of our athletics pro-
gram.”

Six former student athletes, one 
head coach and a former athletics 
director were chosen as part of the 
first inaugural class. The former 
student-athletes — all competing in 
the ‘80s and ‘90s — have 30 nation-
al titles among them and include: 
Christine Behrens (women’s tennis), 

Ele Johnson (women’s soccer), Bill 
Kazmierowicz (water polo), Diana 
Klintworth (women’s volleyball), 
Travis Miller (swimming and diving) 
and Julie Swail (water polo). 

Former UCSD women’s and men’s 
volleyball coach, serving between 
1979 and 1995, Doug Dannevik also 
earned the Hall of Fame distinc-
tion, along with former Athletic 
Director Judy Sweet. Sweet served 
as the Athletics Director for 24 years 

UCSD honors eight former athletes and administrators in Sunday ceremony.
