o 
Can forests IS well IS people survive 

in Africa's Rift Valley? 
Whether as a result of clearings for 

agriculture and grazing or the increasing 
demand for fuelwood, the progressive 
destruction of natural woodlands is one 
of the most insidious environmental 
problems facing East Africa today. But, 
as a contributing factor to the severe 
famine and drought afflicting parts of 
Africa today, deforestation moves 
beyond the realm of environmental 
issues to become a concern In human 
survival itself. 

With growing population centers 
comes a desperate need for fuelwood. 
Yet the clearing of forests today virtually ass~res a future depleted not only of 
trees but stable soil that will suppOrt 
agriculture . 

Can the replanting of native trees halt 
the soil erosion that dooms crops in a 
nalion already threatened by famine? 

This vital conservation issue will be 
the focus of a study this summer by UC 
Santa Barbara geographer Julia AlLen .and 
her field expedition team in Tanzania. 

The research project is sponsored by 
the Universiry Research ExpeditiOns 
Program (UREP), a Berkeley-based 
organization which specializes i.n 
matching interested amateurs with 
University of California scientists in 
need of field and financial assistance to 
carry out their field research. 

Dr. Allen is looking for about 12-15 
people with an interest in 
environmental studies to spend two 
weeks at various field sites in the Rift 
Valley collecting samples.of native trees 
and noting the charactenstlcs of their 
habitats. Since the field techniques will 
be taught at the site, no previous 
experience is necessary to join the 
expedition. 

The "Woodland Preservation" project 
in Tanzania is but one of 25 UREP 
expeditions slated for summer of 1985. 

As in all UREP projects, each 
participant makes a tax-deductible 
contribution to join the expedlUon 
which covers the basic research 
expenses as well as their 0",:" food and 
accommodations. The contnbutlons for 
joining research teams range from $535 
to $L,675, excluding airfair (which is 
usually deductible as well). The . 
contribution for joining the Tanzama 
expedition IS $1.375.

fesIival wiU feature a variery of 
entertaining events, drawing from aU the 
anistic departments on campus. The 
Festival will kick otT with a "Stonehenge" 
parry and a TGIF on Thursday and 
Friday of the eighth week, May 23 and 
H. 

During the (ollowing two weeks. 
events ranging from art installations to 
dance performances to a band driving 
around in an open-air bus will enrich 
the atmosphere on campus. All the 
events will be free or Inexpensive 
because the Festival is intended to 
encourage the "non-art" students to 
realize and enjoy the diversity of art 
happening here on campus. . 

The Festival was conceived three 
years ago to give recognition to the art 
departments at a school known . mainly 
as a science, computer and engmeenng 
stronghold. The onginal idea, still at 
work today, was to involve all of the 
campus in the arts, removmg the 
barriers separating the departments. 

The Festival is funded mainly by two 
sources, the Council of Provosts and the 
Office of the Vice Chancellor of 
Undergraduate Affairs. Their monies go 
towards underwriting performance coses 
and publicity as well IS funding a great 
deal of IndiVidual or group stUdent 
projects. This funding provides 
opportUnities for many students to do 
work they could nOt otherwise afford. 
Each of the individual departments 
involved in the Festival is given a . 
separate budget, and the project grants 
are distribure(i to qualified students by 
those departments. 

The Festival adds much color and 
character to UCSD, involVing students 

.. , 

and the surrounding communiry in a 
celebration of the artS. CY

Brower was credited by colleaaucs for 
the stopping of myriad man-maae 
envtronmental disasters almost single-
handedly and for inspiring the public to 
join the wilderness campaign in droves. 
He was instrumental in developing the 
publicity tactics that are credited with 
preventing the construction of twO dams 
In the Grand Canyon and elsewhere. 

A former editor for the Universiry of

Alexander is preSident-elect 

25 016 turnout for AS elections 

Out With the Old: LameÂ·duck AS President Marc &Jroditshy. 

By SEAN WAGSTAFF. News Editor 
Things went pretty much as expected in the ASUCSD 

elections Tuesday and Wednesday, with the RSVP sla te 
running away with a landslide victOry as its only real 
competition , None of the Above, lived up to its name, 
winning none of the offices for which its members ran. 

Mary Rose Alexander was elected AS president, and 
her RSVP runnmg mates won the offices of vice 
president of administra tion (Ariel Anguiano. who ran 
unopposed), vice preSident of external affairs (Greg 
Arnold), financial vice preSIdent Gill LI[schiz), and all of 
the commissioner poSitions. In all. RSVP won 15 
positions, nine of them unopposed. 

The scene was different in the College Senate race , 
which had a mixed showing of Independent candidates 
and candidates from the Three Revelle Reps slate and 
RSVP. Third College alone was swept by the RSVP 
phenomenon. . 

Alexander IS currently AS vice preSident and took 
the electoral victory after a narrowly unsuccessful bid 
earlier this year to become the UC Student Regent. OUt 
of many applicants for the year-long pOSition that is 
designed to give students a vote and a voice in the UC 
Regents, A1exaltder was one o[ three finalists for the 
position, but lost to a UC Davis student. 

The RSVP slate focused on the issues that deal wtih 
the lack of student involvement on campus, the alcohol 
limitations pr.oposed by the AdmInistration, the 
increase In s tudent fees, services and programs for the 
expanding campus, and gaining a louder voice for the 
students of UCSD through such organizations as the 
UC Student lobby.

Viewpoint 

Countering with the Contras 
By e.G, AURIO 

For centuries, the countries of Cenrral 
America have been dominated by 
foreign powers. ranging from Spanish 
colonialism [0 the banana republics . 
under the Monroe Doctrine. The Central 
American people as a whole have been un-
able to exercise their rights to self-determi-
nation in the internal affairs of their 
countries. A case in point is Nicaragua. 

Following the thoroughly justified 
overthrow of the Somoza regime in 
1979, a new era of foreign domination 
commenced for the Nicaraguan people. 
The currenr cozy relationship between 
Nicaragua's Sandinista leadership and 
the Soviet bloc has produced a new 
breed of tyrants in Nicaragua , beholden 
to the Soviet Union. As each day passes, 
Sandinista icaragua continues to lower 
the familiar iron curtain around its 
people, depicting yet another Soviet 
conquest in its relentless expansion of 
its growing empire. 

The Cuban Soviet Presence 
The SOVIet Union seldom if ever triggers 

revolutIOns; it grabs pawer inside a 
revolution. It Infiltrates revolutions and 
Infiltrates governments, and thIS IS 
ImpoSSible to combat by military means. 
From thiS, the lovers of totalttananlsm draw 
the sat isfactory conclusion that jorce can 
never triumph over the [Xople 's hope for 
Independence and freedom. Mistake! 
ConfiscatIOn oj revolutions and freedom 
movements is the surest way to stifle those 
hopes. The Nica raguans are among the 
most rea n! to have learned th is when. 
between 1979 and 1981 , they exchanged 
one jorm of despotISm for another. 

Jean- Francois Revel 
How Democracies Pensh 

Over the past decade, icaragua has 
become one of the countless victims of 
Soviet imperialism. The colonization of 
Nicaragua by the Soviet Umon. through 
ItS Cuban proxy. nears completion . The 
goal of self-determination for the 
Nicaraguan people 15 fadmg fast In the 
face of longevity and permanence; 
realities that pervade Soviet imperiahsm. 
In addition , the Soviets are masters at the 
art of deception . Theyadvance their brand 
of imperialsim under the banner of "wars of 
national liberation ." seeking to subjugate 
nations in the name of their people. 

It is unfortunate that Central Amenca 
has fallen into the context of the East-
West conflic t. The introduction of a 
Cuban / Soviet military presence in 

Icaragua , combined with its geo-
pohtical position , has thrust the entire 
region on to the center stage o f the 
co nfl icr. icaragua has been transformed 
mto a fo rward continental base for 
Soviet Imperialism. 

In a recent Guardian editorial (April 
4), "Freedom in mahgned Nicaragua." 
the editorial writer (MJC) eludes any 
reference to the Cuban/ Soviet military 
presence. The presence cannot simply 
be ignored. hoping that it will just go 
away. In effect , those who ignore it 
become knowing coUaborators. 
condemning the Nicaraguan people, as 
well as those of Central America, [0 the 
inevitable consequences surrounding 
unopposed Soviet-supported tyranny 
and aU its horrors. 

During the reign of the Somoza 
dynasty, the corrupt dictatorship's 
repressive policies were confined within 
the borders of icaragua. Somoza never 
exhibited an appetite for external 
expansion. In short, Somoza's repression 
was not considered a threat to his 
neighbors. I am nOt trying to legitimatize 
or justify the right-wing dictatorship; 
rather. to display an important 

delegations to the inauguration of 
undemocratically elected "President" 
Daniel Ortega Saavedra in January, 1985. 
An unopposed Sandinista Nicaragua, 
supported and controlled by the Soviet 
bloc, raises the question of self-
determination to heights of regiona'l 
dimensions. 
In Defense of Nicaraguan Free-
dom Fighters 

Presently, Nicaragua is engaged in a 
bloody civil war. The Nicaraguan 
Freedom Fighters have taken up arms 
against the Sandinislas. They oppose 
the Sandinistas for two legitimate 
reasons: 1) the Sandinistas have 
abandoned the original goals, social 
justice , freedom and democracy, of the 
revolution; 2) the growing dependence 
of the Sandinistas to the Soviet bloc. In 
the same Guardian editorial (April 4). 
the Freedom Fighters were subjected to 

1'1'; ,\ IE ':" 

difference between Somoza and the 
Sandinistas in the nature of their 
regimes. In contrast, the Sandinistas. 
mdebted to the Soviet bloc for their 
survival , are perceived by their 
neighbors as Instruments of Soviet 
expansion. In effect. the Sandinistas 
pose a direct threat to those non-
communist governments in the region. 

Honduras, EI Salvador and Costa Ri ca 
have become increaSingly uncomfortable 
with the Sandinistas' expanding 
relationship with the Soviet bloc. They 
fear that Nicaragua is fast becoming the 
staging grounds for sponsoring armed 
subversion against their governments , In 
EI Salvador, the Marxist guerillas have 
been receiving training in Nicaragua 
and Soviet bloc military aid . These three 
countries bordering Nicaragua all 
refrained from sending official 

an unfair lambasting by the uninformed 
MJc. 

War is hell; it is nOt at all uncommon 
for civilians to be killed in time of war. I 
am not implying that it is right; rather, 
it is unavoidable. Anyone with a limited 
knowledge about guerilla warfare 
understands the necessiry for guerilla 
movements to maintain a good 
relationship with the countrysic!e, where 
they predominantly operate. In 
Nicaragua, thl! civilians in the 
countryside provide the Freedom 
Fighters with information , food and , 
most importantly. manpower. For the 
Freedom Fighters to indiscriminately 
attack civilians would be 
counterproductive and plain foolish . 
During my stay at a Freedom Fighter 
camp m Jinotega, Nicaragua, I was 
exposed to their tactics. The overall 

EOIT~ PHUP lAI.X)EA 

strategy for the Freedom Fighters is to 
inflict casualties on the enemy-the 
Sandinistas-not to waste valuable 
rounds of ammunition indiscrimil)antly 
kiUing civilians. Furthermore, a 
significant portion of the people kiUed 
by the Freedom Fighters as. "civilians," 
the media have knowingly mislabeled. 
In fact, in most cases, these "civilians" 
were the enemy, either Sandinistas in 
civilian dress or Sandinista collaborators 
working against the cause of the 
Freedom Fighters. There have been 
isolated incidents of abuses or atrocities 
committed by the Freedom Fighters 
against civilians. However, these 
incidents have been distorted and 
blown way out of proportion by those 
opposed to the Freedom Fighters. 

Contrary to Mles editorial inference, 
the Freedom Fighters are not bands of 
former Somocista National Guardsmen, 
committed to reestablishing a right-wing 
dictatorship. The average age of the 
Freedom Fighters ranges from 15 to 23 
years old (give or take a few years). 
Most of them were too young to serve in 
Somoza's National Guard. There is a 
limited number of former National 
Guardsmen, but it comprises a smaU 
minoriry. Moreover, there are growing 
numbers of former Sandinistas who 
have deserted and joined the Freedom 
Fighters. The bulk of the fighting forces 
consists of Campesinos (poor peasants), 
who prefer to volunteer for the Freedom 
Fighters rather than being drafted or 
abducted ioto the Sandinista army or 
militia. 

As long as there is a Cuban/ Soviet 
presence in Nicaragua, it must be 
challenged as it is by the Nicaraguan 
Freedom Fighters. Their presence 
constlrutes a growing threat to the entire 
Western Hemisphere. The issue at hand 
is not Marxism/ Leninism in Nicaragua. 
In a recent interview with the California 
Review, former Secretary of State 
Alexander M. Haig remarked. "I happen 
to believe that an isolated Nicaragua, 
unsupported by Cuba or the Soviet 
Union , would collapse under its own 
,,(eight-would reject Marxism." The 
issue at hand is the consequences of a 
Cuban/ Soviet military presence on the 
North American continent. It entails the 
current threat to Central America and 
the future prospects of Soviet 
imperialism spreading down towards 
South America and north into Mexico. 
Once the presence has been removed , 
by diplomacy or by military force, then 
the people of Central America, 
particularly Nicaragua. will be able to 
exercise their right of self-determination.

Surreal Sandinistas 
Editor: 

The April 4, 1985 edition of the UCSD Guardian . 
with the large photo of a smiling Comandante Daniel 
Ortega Saavedra gazing Out through Big BrOlheresque 
eyes, has a misleading banner of "Perspectives on 
Nicaragua ," when , in fact , it contains seveml articles 
from only one perspective-that of the pro-Marxist left. 

While the Contras are undoubtedly not a 
homogeneous group of Thomas Jeffersons , I find your 
incredible pro-Sandinista bias inexcusable. You 
describe the Sandinistas' mistreatment of the Miskito 
Indians as if the present Nicaragua regime were 
actually looking out for their welfare by "forcing them 
from their homeland to less war-tom areas." I find this 
a rather slanted description of the program of 
genOCide the Sandinistas carried out against the 
Miskito Indians. 

While it is laudable that Nicaraguan revolution 
overthrew the Somoza dictatorship. the Sandinistas 
have betrayed that revolution by setting up an equally 
repressive , totalitarian regime . Despite the egalitarian 
frothings of the Marxist Sandinistas, the people of 
Nicaragua live in as great a poverty as ever, and are 
experiencing a declining standard of living, despite the 
millions of dollars of military suppon from the Cubans. 

Marxist economics have been proven a joke. a 
dismal failure as the Western capitalist countries have 
continuaUy outperformed socialist countries In 
technology, personal liberty, and standards of living. 
Rather than having the State "wither away" as Lenin 
promised. communist governments have . throughout 
history, grown larger and more repressive. Communist 
regimes replace nobility with a party elite: thai prey 
upon the populace with the same greed and resulting 
exploitation that one finds in a feudal system, 

I f, as the liberals would have us believe, the people 
of Nicaragua are so solidly behind the Sandinistas, why 
are thousands deserting from the Nicaraguan Army? 
Why must the Sandinistas drive trucks through viUages 
conscripting soldiers at gunpoint? A truly popular 
movement would have plenty of volunteers to support 
it. Why must the Sandinistas force the people of 
Nicaragua to join its Army through threats of death 
and acts of violence? In fact. why aren't the American 
liberals vehemently demonstrating in Managua to end 
conscription? Why do they continually ignore the 
repression of leftist regimes? 

The Gllllrdian lists several stories of Contra atrocities. 
You should look at the scars on my friend Rene 
Barbarenas where the Sandinistas ran barbed wire 
through his nose to tie him to a post and left him to 
die . If you have a really strong stomach'Jou can ask 
him about the death of his girlfriend an Sandinista 
bayonets. This certainly doesn't justify the barbarous 
ac ts of the Contras. but the Sandinistas are no flower 
children either. 

In using such haUowed tOnes to describe the beauty 
of the Sandinistas. your editorial ignores the fact that 
there is no freedom as we know it in Nicaragua, and 
no hope of finding freedom if the present regime is 

allowed to carry on as it has. It is ludic rous to say that 
Nicaragua has self-determination under the 
Sandinis tas. The election you describe so wonderously 
was a farce . In keeping with Marxist-Leninist ideology. 
the State-run media only allows the people to hear the 
propaganda it WdntS them to hear. Reporters visiting 
Nicaragua have found the people afraid to criticize the 
government on camera or when soldiers or possible 
Sandinista agents are near. With strict control over the 
information available to a largely illiterate population 
and suppression of public criticism. it is no surprise 
that the ruling Sandinistas won the election. 

As politicians are apt to do, there is no doubt that 
President Reagan overstated his case in describing the 

Doonesbury 

OFFICI OF CAMI'US RECREATION & 

virtues of the Contras, They are a d iverse coalit ion , 
ranging from past members o f the Somoza National 
Guard to Marxists that Originally fought alongSide the 
Sandinistas in the revolution against Somoza. However, 
they are the best option available to the US to pressure 
the Sandinistas to reform their totalitarian ways. 

The United States has a strategiC interest in limiting 
communist influence in Central America. It has a moral 
duty to promote human rights throughout the world , 
and to use its influence to obtain the freedom of 
oppressed nations when it can. The only inklings of 
reform from rhe Sandinistas have come as a direct 
result of US pressure ap>ied through the Contras.

The US must do everything it can to 
avoid placing its combat troops in 
Central Ameri a, the best way to do this 
is by the use of other measures to 
contain communist aggreSSion and 
discourage totalitarianism. Those who 
are truly interested in the welfare of the 

icaraguans, and not JUSt Marxist 
rhetoric, would suppOrt the formation of 
a truly democratic government with a 
free-marke t economic system and a 
private , censor-free pre s. This may be 
too much to hope for In the near term , 
but at least the US c<ln for e the 
Sandlni tas to be ome responsive to the 
call for freedom that p rompted the 
overthrow of the omoza regime 

Ending U aid to the Contras Will 
take away the most effective method of 
reforming the Nicaraguan regime, and 
leave us only With less palatable 
alternatives.

I'd like to put In my two cents about 
John Trumpler (AS Comm. for Appt's

1) JT. has dysleXia, F.Y.l. I don't 

know why he did not have his writmg 
proofread, as he usually does , but the

the conte nt (the sensible message of the 
letter) and the form (the horrendous 
spelling) is obvious; that i a primary 
tool for detecting disabilities like 
dysleXia. 

2) Printing that letter as is was for no 
other reason than to humiliate him; 
what a lovely campus editorial policy. 
Would you like to print my grades this 
quarter? 

Actually John's gOl nothmg to be 
ashamed of, as he knows. Like chickens

Editor: 

I wish to protest the perfunctory 
dismissal you gave to the letter from C. 
Brandon Crocker in the Monday, April 8 
Guardian. 

Let my position be clear. I personally 
despise the strident and often 
mcoherentjingoism of the Califomia 
Review and believe the publication'S 
conservative hate-mongering to be an 
msult to my intelligence and , 
presumably, the vast majority of 
intelligences within the university. I do 
not presume Mr. Crocker's veracity, 
either: his statement as to the 
importance of his publication'S latest 
endeavors may well be exaggerated. 
Nevertheless, if what Mr. Crocker stated 
was correct, then the actions undertaken

newsworthy, if only ominously so. Your

was a disservice to its readership; your 
cavalier retort to Mr. Crocker's que\)' 
was a smug insult to the same. The 
students of this campus deserve 
journalistic integrity in their most

not deserve the gratuitOus and immature 
"frivolity" of such editorial responses.

Local CalPIRG plans to continue lobby 
By LIL YS McCOY, Contnbutmg News Editor 

THE CALIFORNIA Public Interest Research Group (CaIPIRG) has vowed to fight the decision to 
veto its fee payment referendum. 

The group has informally requested 
the assistance of Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson in its battle to appeal the 
move , according to Kim Paulus, chair of 
CaIPIRG's statewide board of directors. 

"I think it's prelty clear," Paulus said, 
"that Dr. Watson is nOl going to honor 
the student vote, and that is why we are 
calling on the Chancellor to step in ." 

After a meeting between the 
Chancellor and CalPIRG Tuesday, 
Atkinson said that he planned to 
research the issue further, but, at this 
time, he agrees with the veto decision 
made by Watson, Paulus said. 

"The students of this campus are 
really going to have to come out-after 
showing the Widespread community 
support through the electoral process-
and communicate to the Chancellor 
their strong support for CaIPIRG, 
because he hasn't felt it yet," she said. 

Referendum #6, which was widely 
endorsed by the AS Council, proposed 
that a $3 "voluntary fee" be added to the 
minimum total students are required to 
pay, with a written option aUowing 
students to deduct the amount from the 
given tOtal. 

Watson has said that CaIPIRG's 
referendum is "unacceptable" and 
"misleading." He stated that studenrs 
must be clearly informed of the absolute 
minimum fees they must pay to enroU, 
according to University policy, and that 
CaIPIRG's proposed form does not do 
that. 

Watscn has said repeatedly that a so-
caUed "waivable fee" form of the type 
advocated by CalPIRG fails to meet 
University requirements that caU for 
mandatory and voluntary fees to be 
listed se parately. Therefore, the 
referendum will be ignored and a form 

Elections 
( CONTINUED FROM PAGE 3( 

The referenda an passed, mostly by a 
fairly wide margin, but because 2,741 
votes were cast by an eligible pool of 
slightly more than 11 ,000 fee-paying 
undergraduates (24.8%), the 
constitutional fee lock-ins and the 
CalPIRG fee referendum will all hang in 
limbo until the founh week of the 
quarter, when official enrollment counts 
are made. The constitutional lock-ins 
must be approved by a majority of 25% 
of the voting pool, while the CaiPIRG 
measure must receive majority approval 
of 19% of the total UCSD enrollment, 
including graduates, to qualify for 

listing four payment options will be 
used instead, Watson said . 

According to Paulus, "The thing that's 
so frustrating is that the democratic 
process is not being respected ." 

Paulus believes, as do her co-workers 
at CaIPIRG, that their form states the 
choices in an easily understood fashion . 

"(Students will) know the minimum 
they have to pay in order to enroll, 
because it is so blatantly clear on the 
(proposed) registration form . I haven't 
talked to one single student who 
thought it was confusing," she said. 

Before elections, Watson suggested an 
alternative to CaIPIRG's referendum. His 
proposal gave students the choice 
between "Form A," which included two 
payment options-minimum registration 
fee plus the $3 for CaIPIRG, or the 
minimum registration fee plus CalP1RG 
and health insurance-and "Form B." 

Form B is the format which the 
Administration has decided to 
implement regardless of the referendum 
results. The form offers four payment 
options: minimum registration fee , 
minimum registration fee including a $3 
donation for CaIPIRG, minimum 
registration fee, including health 
insurance only, and the minimum 
registration fee including CalPIRG and 
health insurance, 

According to Paulus, the two-form 
choice proposed by the Administration 
is undemocratic. 

"The way a democracy works is that 
someone brings forward a proposal and 
people vote yes or no on it .... You don't 
offer alteJl1ate proposals from the 
opposition, the opposition campaigns 
against you," she said. 

UCSD's CalPlRG chapter would have 
to fold if Form B is implemented , Paulu~ 
said. 

"(Watson's) form won't fund CaIPIRG. 
With his form, CalPIRG will not be on 
this campus next year," she said. 

voluntary fee status. The Administration, 
however, still intends to ignore the 
CaiPIRG referendum, passed or not. 

As a result of the newly adopted AS 
Constitution, there will be three vice 
preSidents next year. The vice president 
of administration is responsible for 
managing UCSD personnel, acting as 
preSident in the event of her absence, 
and acting as chairperson at Council 
meetings. The vice president of external 
affairs will oversee aU external affairs of 
the ASUCSD on a local, state and 
rtational level and will serve as the 
Student Body Presidents' Council 
representative. The financial vice 
president will advise the president and 
the Council on all budgetary malters, 
develop procedures to generate income, 
oversee ASUCSD poliCies and 
procedures concerning the use of 
activity fees, and assist in student 
organizations' budgeting procqses. Ii:J

The major problem, Paulus said, with 
the Administration's proposed format IS 
that the $3 fee is labeled a donation 
instead of a waivable fee, something she 
sees as discouraging students to support 
CaIPIRG. Paulus maintains that unless it 
seems like a majority of the students are ' 
helping to fund CaIPIRG's programs, 
then very few people will pay the 
elevated registration fee when faced 
with a lesser one. 

But Watson has emphasized that only 
two types of fees are recognized by the 
University "from the President and the 
Regents on down ," and that both types 
must be listed separately, he said . 

"In the best of all worlds," Paulus said , 
"( students would pay the extra $3), but 
with the waivable fee system, people will 
see that (the fees) include CaIPIRG, and 
they'll pay it, whereas with the donation 
system, they'll JUSt pay the lowest 
amount" 

She is also convinced that student 
support is what should determine if an 
organization should remain on campus, 
not the finanCial decision of an 
administrator. 

'The issue is, do students want to 
fund CaIPIRG, or do they not? If 
students don't want to fund CalPIRG, 
then they vote no," she said. 

But they haven't been voting no. In 
1978, a measure similar to ~ferendum 
#6 was ?assed and implemented until 
1982, Pallus said, when the 
Administration made changes on the 
registration form , without consulting the 
students, turning the waivable fee into a 
donation. 

In reply to the administrative move, a 
referendum was placed on the 1983 
ballot which readdressed the CalPIRG 
fund ing issue . Students voted in favor of 
this measure also. However, the 
confirmation of support was ignored 
and the $3 amount remained a donation 
request on the registration card. 

During CaIPIRG's most recent attempt 
to rally the students, 6,000 students 
signed a petition supporting a voluntary 
fee which would be included in thetr 
enroUmenr total. 

"By adding (the $3) in , it makes it a 
fee and it givss it a legitimacy that a fee 
implies. When students show enough 
support for something that they're 
willing to tax themselves ro make sure 
that the program goes on and is stably 
funded , then that shows a level of 
student support that is necessary (for 
such a program to exist)," Paulus said. 

CaIPIRG, which is required in its 
bylaws to have documented student 
suppOrt, usually through the ratification 
of a volunrary fee , needs these 
guaranteed funds to operate. 

"In order to be able to hire staff and 
ro do long-term planning, there needs to 
be enough suppOrt on campus that 
students are willing to pay a fee, 
because othetwise we can't hire lawyers, 
researchers and lobbyists to help us do 
what we want to, if there is no 
guarantee that student suppOrt is there ," 
she said. 

Since the winter of 1982, Paulus said , 
UCSD's CalPlRG has been subsidized by 
other statewide chapters. 

She confirmed that this essentially 
means students at other campuses have 
been mdirectly supporting our chapter. 

Those subsidizing the UCSD chapter 
include UC Berkeley, UC Santa Cruz, 
UC Santa Barbara and UCLA, all of 
which are funded by voluntary fees 
similar to the one proposed here , Paulus 
said . 

According to Paulus, the statewide 
board, which voted the last three years 
to underwrite UCSD's CaIPIRG, has 
decided to discontinue its support and 
close the chapter here. 

"It just wouldn't be fair (to) continue 
this way. It sets a bad precedent. We're 
leeching off the rest of the chapters," 
she said . ~

about people who are brain-dead , 
people who have terminal illnesses or

in our SOCiety is that medical technology 
has expanded the array of choices that 
we have to make. It is very imponant 
for us [0 have a discussion of who's a 
human. When , If at all, do you obtain 
your right to humanness? When do you 
lose your right to humanness? Under 
what conditions are you considered a 
member of the human community? In a 
sense , that is the deepest debate going 
on, and that's the one that's never 
expliCitly talked about. It jusr gets 
focused on embryos. What Hatch and 
Helms argue is that life begins at 
conception . In a sense, that begs the 
question. Why is conception the 
legitimate point for deciding an entity is 
a member of the human commumty? I'm 
not sure I have the answer. What they 
don't say is they think that everybody 
who's genetically human is <I member of 
the human community. Well , it seems to 
me to lead to the system, for instance, 
111 Italy, where if you're dying of 
termin,11 cancer, you need a kidney 
transplant and your name is next on the 
itst , you get the kidney transplant even 
though you're d}1ng because evel)'body's 
a human , all humans have equal rights 
[0 resources, and it would be morally 
wrong to make deCisions among 
humans. In the United Stdtes, we've 
tended to make another decision; which 
is to say, first come, first served, but 

happens In the abortion debate is that 
there are two scven-year-olds, standing 
on a street comer going: 

"Baby!" 
"Fetus!" 
"Baby'" 
"Fetus!" 
"Baby!" 
"Fetus!" 
"Baby killer!" 
"Hangers! " 
"Baby kille r! " 
"Rusty hangers' "

baby, and it's obvious to the other side 
it is a fetus. It is also obvious that 
neither side has the good sense to tl)'

tForty .. Two' 
is a lucky 
number for 
local artists 

By JACK DURANT 
The La Jolla Museum of 

Contemporary Art's new show, 
Forty - two Emerging Artists, 
demonstrates the incredible artistic 
community which is developing in 
San Diego, San Diego has developed 
and matured as a city, and never 
before has there been so diverse and 
talented a group of artists as those 
included in this show, 

A productive artist community 
can only exist with an extensive 
support system of universities, 
galleries and patrons, creating a 
fertile environment. Only recently 
has this sort of environment come 
into being here in San Diego, 

The works themselves do not 
reflect the supporting environment 
of the artistic community but rather 
the physical environment of San 
Diego and the surrounding area. 
Because the artists are based in this 
area, there is a familiarity in the 
subjects portrayed. We see beach 
scenes and San Diego nei2hbor-
hoods, the Mexican border and the 
military. 

Several artists who are or were 
connected to UCSD have work 
featured in the show, The best of 
these is Ernest Silva, whose paintings 
demonstrate a deep dedication to 
paint and composition. There is no 
confusion in Silva's works; he solves 
all of his problems off the canvas, 
loading the scales in his own favor, 
Silva teac.hes painting classes here at 
UCSD. 

Frank Cole is a former UCSD 
student and has done a very exciting 
installation piece especially for the 
exhibit, His Tower of Power is a 30-
foot-high oil-derrick-type structure 
on top of which sits a giant 
armyman's head on top of which 
floats a helicopter. Cole's piece is a 

reaction to his own military 
experience and to the constant 
presence of the military in the San 
Diego area, Scrawled upon the tower 
is a sardonic limerick emphasizing 
the tragic quality of the hero 
mentality. 

One aspect of the show that is not 
usually included in art exhibits is 
fashion design, and one of the 
designers is also a tJCSD alumnus. 
Margaret Honda's fashions create a 
ceremonial s~nsibility of ancient 
ritual by layering rectangles of 
greyish blue natural fibers. 
Alternatel y she uses large amounts 
of pleats to build out from her figure 
while at the same time exposing parts 
which are not normally exposed . 

There is an incredible range and 
diversity of talents and ideas in the 
show. With 42 artists there are lots 
of wonderful pieces to satify every 
viewer's eye. This is not to say that 
all the works are good, Much of the 
work is experimental, and in all 
experiments there are successes and 
failures, Overall, it is the best show 
I' ve seen in years and I recommend it 
very highly, The museum is free on 
Wednesday nights and only a dollar 
for students the rest of the time. For 
more information, call 454-3541.

April 11, 1985 Hianu S 



By RODDY BOGAWA popularity has finally surfaced with 
the surprise hit of the year. Rolling 
Stone and Musician have found their 
music distancing as well as 
intriguing. H ere lie a few young kids 
who haven' t lost their sensibility to 
the music industry suck-ups, and 
who are just as unabashedly honest 
in their music and concerts as they 
were when they started . Their 
albums are a collage of styles ranging 
from hardcore punk to blues and 
ballads to country-western. Rather 
than a forced attempt to leap from 
style to style, the music becomes 

~, .. ,n. M .... , 

jockey shorts, or the Arizona show 
where he "relieved himself" behind 
his amplifiers. 

00000000000000 

â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢ ~.I/~ fOlIa. ( 
There have been shows where they 

play almost all cover songs from 
bands like the Jacksons, Led 
Zeppelin, Thin lizzy, etc. On record, 
they've recorded "Black Diamond" 
(a Kiss cover), a country number in 
which they all switch instruments 
and on and on. 

This Friday is a special day. No, 
it's not the Friday Christ left to rise 
up again that very Sunday, but it is 
the night of what may be one of the 
best concerts of this year. Okay, [ 
heard Depeche Mode was good too, 
but this is a different league. This is 
the stuff great bands are made of. No 
frills, no fireworks (at least yet), no 
pretensions. Perhaps the only 
insistence The Replacements make 
on their audiences is that this is what 
they are, take it or leave it. This is 
where the magic lies. They would 
certainly be the first to tell you that 
they aren't rock stars or particularly 
glamorous, and don't travel to the 
tropics so they can sing and dance in 
their music videos. Simply, The 
Replacements are about tearing 
down the mythology of rock and 
roll. 

It is easy to find 
The Replacelllents 

So there you have it. I was or.ce 
told they had trouble touring 
because of their age, and that they 
could only tour on summer vacation 
from high school, so Friday will be a 
special show. They've left the 
brotherhood of Twin Tone Records 
who believed in them enough to 
release their first four records, and 
signed a major label deal with Sire 
Records. 

D 
Now, four albums, an EP and a 

live cassette down the road , their 
latest release-snidely titled Let It 
Be-has brought them into the 
limelight and the well-deserved 
credit long due them. Taken under 
wing by other musicians of 
substantital credentials, such as 
Exene and John Doe of X and Peter 
Buck of REM , who contributes a 
solo on one of the tracks off the new 
album, their underground 

their own bastardization and blend. 
However, the music has one 
co mmon root throughout-
conviction. You can bet The 
Replacements have a lot to say, 
whether it be humorous, hopeless or 
filled with teenage angst. 

Their concerts have become tales 
of conquest. like the Los Angeles gig 
where the lead guitarist wore only

There has alwa ys been the drive to 
create music honestly, but also the 
drive to keep their sanity in an insane 
business. They play the court jester; 
the kid in the class who is made to 
stand in the corner; the unashamed 
youth we all must leave behind. 

They no longer have much trouble 
with their ages and are freer to do 
longer tours to promote themselves. 
For those of us who have grown up 
while they have, it's encouraging to 
know they have done it so gracefully 
and effortlessly. The success of The 
Replacements has shown that it's 
okay to fall flat on your face, so long 
as you get up. They'll be in concert 
Friday at San Diego State's 
Backdoor, so have fun. See you 
there.

shows making this an extremely

inception have been certainly 
well documented and unexag-
gerated, as I was once wimess to. 
Once frequented by such friends 
as Jeffery Lee Pierce of Gun 
Club, Tex and the Horseheads 
have come into their own, 
releasing a debut L.P. receiving 
critical acclaim, and their Stage

A NOTE FROM ERNIE 
Revelle Dean Ernie Mon has 

been in England since the 
beginning of the year studying the 
British collegiate system. Right 

,now, he is at Keynes College, the 
University of Canterbury in Kent, 
England. He sent this leiter to 
Revelle Students: 

Greetings from Canterbury. The 
winter term here at Kent has JUSt 
concluded. and the mass exodus 
for mid-term break is underway. 
How reminiscent it all is of scenes 
at Revelle College JUSt before 
quarter break. 

Keynes College, where I am a 
member and have an office, has 
really become my home away from 
home. The students and faculry 
have all been most hfiSpitable and 
genuinely interested in sharing 
information about our collegiate 
universities. 

Apan from my study project, I 
have also gOllen around to visit 
some of our EAP students in 
Britain. (At Sussex. I met with Clare 
Thalken , Tracy Wasserman , and 
Diane Dumas. Two weeks ago, I 
had a great visit with David 
Craford at Leeds, and will soon be 
visiting Katie True in Stirling, 
Scotland. David and Katie are both 
from Revelle.) 

Back at Revelle , I know you have 
a very busy quarter ahead of you. If 
it doesn't sound too corny, I really 
do miss you all. Take care of the 
place, especially the Fountain, and 
I will see you all in the fall .

T RANSPORTATION. You can't live with it, and you sure as hell can't live without it. 
There is a lot to be said about living 

in the dorms. You can walk anywhere 
you really need to go- and you can 
bum rides off friends if you want to go 
somewhere you don't really nud to go. 
like the Zoo or the Stadium or Fifth 
and Revoluci6n in Tijuana, places like 
that. 

Not so for commuters. 
One option that presents itself to 

many is relying on the bus. Ooh, ah. 
I have to say right off that I have 

never dealt with city buses on anything 
resembling a consistent basis. All 1 know 
is that they're not a lot of fun . 1 never 
even liked school buses myself, and 
school buses are fairly reliable, they 
don't steal your money. and they don't 
require transfers via Oceanside or 
Ocotillo. Also, at least you could throw 
paper wads on school buses. And 1 still 
thought they were a pain. I hated 
dealing with the jerks who sat on the 
inside pan of the seat and refused to 
scoot over-man, what is your problem? 
1 hated geaing on the bus when it was 
about two-thirds full ; look, someone is 
going to have to sit three to a seat-
who's it gonna be? I always tried to give 
a l-reak to the people who looked 
accommodating or sweet. and went for 
the seat with the dude who had a 
sudden urge to get Into a deep political 
discussion with the other person in the 
seat so that I wouldn't interrupt them 
and would move on. So 1 used reverse 
psychology. I don't know if it worked or 
not. All 1 know was that I was happy as 
a lark (are larks happy?) when either my 
parents or a friend's parents gave me a 
ride home-no bus today, what a 
shame. 

People who ride city buses live city 
buses., Their pockets can be heard for 
blocks, jingling with the exact change 
for the week's voyages. In their heads 
they keep the schedules for the 34 and

41 straight, at leaSl as far as they need 
to get home. Every day of their life 
revolves around the last run for the 
evening-last bus leaves at 6; I gOlta be 
out of here by then. When they need to 
get to San Diego, they rush over to 
EDNA and fill their pockets with those 
little folded-up schedules. Let's see, the 
28 leaves at 10:27, gets to Genesee and 
Balboa at 11: 19. From there I can 
tral1sfer to the 9, which leaves at 12: 12 
and gets to C Street at 1 :06. Then 1 can 
spend three hours walking around 

without them-we can't remember what 
it was like to rely on bicycles or friends 
or, gulp, buses to get around . We have 
an automobile. We are free to go where 
we like when we like. We have an 
automobile. We proud-say it again . 

And we have problems. 
My car is a 1978 Ford Fiesta. The 

Fiesta is actually a piece of garbage-it'S 
a cheap clone of the VW Rabbit, which 
is not a piece of garbage. A few years 
ago every car maker on the planet 
noticed that the Rabbit had a tendency

catch the 9 at 4:12, transfer to the 28 at 
5:30, and get home by midnight. Bingo. 

But most of us don't deal with buses. 
No, we deal with cars. Ah, cars. You 
should understand that anything that 
moves is a pain in the butt, and is 
bound to break down when you really 
don't want it to-which is pretty much 
anytime, I guess. Cars are a pain. Let us 
forget for the moment about insurance. 
Let us forget about parking permits. Let 
us forget about Tunle Wax and Annor 
All and 53.99 car washes. Let us forget 
even about what a delight it is to 
purchase gas all the time. Let us instead 
focus solely on automobile reliability. 

There are some out there who receive 
BMW sedans every EaSIer, and have 
never had to deal with such proletariat 
activities as standing on the side of 
Interstate 805 pouring a jug of water 
into a steaming radiator. Excuse me, but 
these people can go straight to hell. No 
offense. 
. Which leaves the rest of us. We like 
our cars. We do. We are helpless

G: Since abonion is such a complicated 
issue, what have people thought about

reaction to this touchy subject? 
1.: The militant pro-choice and pro-life 
people haven't liked iI . But everybody 
else has tended to like it. The people 
who are very pro-choice are mad at me 
for not shOWing pro-lifers to be bad 
guys. The pro-lifers are mad at me for 
nO! talking a stand whether or nO! 
abortion is right or wrong. I say at the 
outset that is not my argument. I'm 
investigating how people come to have 
such different opinions in this realm 
when they have the same data, the same 
inforniation in from of them. One group 
of people looks at it and says "fetus," 
and the other group looks at it and says

to sell because it was a good vehicle , so 
all felt it was their dury to cheat the 
patent laws and make a cheap imitation. 
Ford was no exception, and the Fiesta 
was born. Don't get me wrong, it's a 
good car for the dollar. It's zippy and 
cute and gets pretty good mileage. 
But .... 

But it breaks down. At least now it 
does. I try nO! to take it personally. I feel 
I have a certain rappon with my car. 
His name, by the way, is Rocky. Not 
because he's a tough guy, just because ... 
well, because that's his name. that's all. 

Rocky and I have always gotten along, 
but lately he's been acting up. Like this 
morning-about an hour before I'm 
writing this. I was headed up a hill, see, 
and he decided to stan on a coughing 
fit. The hill was the hill towards campus 
on Torrey Pines Road . The place he 
decided to have his fit was that 
dangerous tum where you see skid 
marks and broken glass, the one where 
the road dips so that cars have to go to 
the inside of the lane just a little bit 
more, and not coincidentally that's 

"baby." I'm real interested in how that 
happens. So people who care very 
deeply about the morality of abonion 
are mad at me for not taking a stand. 
G: After you listened to them, I imagine 
people would feel decieved that "you 
fooled me. I thought you were on my 
side and you're not." 
1.: That didn't happen. Nobody said 
that. in a sense , there's a simiiar 
reaction which is, "How could she listen 
to aU these terrific women and not 
realize that abonion is murdering a 
baby? How come she wasn't 
convinced?" 
G: In a way, you represent a lot of 
people because people hear arguments 
from both sides and they still stay the 
same. I wonder if the two groups really 
take that into consideration. The same 
way they form their views in early 
adolescence, well , so does the rest of the

where I was, pUlling along at ten miles 
per hour in a vehicle that was 
determined to end it all for both of us. 
It was very enjoyable and I recommend 
the experience to all who are bored with 
life. ~ . 

I can't complain toO much , though, 
because I didn't get stuck, and I didn't 
get rear-ended by a Buick. Rocky's had 
this disease lately, an on-and-off kind of 
thing. After a week of doing just fine, 
he'D get his coughing fit , usuaUy (but not 
always) while going up a hill, and then 
he'll be fine for another week. 

On-and-off vehicular diseases are the 
best kind . You don't know what the hell 
is going to happen when, and you 
absolutely cannot trust your car, even 
when you have to . The only real cure-
since the disease rarely flares up when 
anyone who knows anything about cars 
takes a look at the engine-is to have 
everything from the carburetor to the 
fuel tank replaced, which doesn't seem 
to be tOO fantastic a solution to me. 

â€¢ It would be so nice to trust my car 
again, to not have to worry when I take 
a 45-minute ride to the East County that 
I will end up in a ditch somewhere in 
EI Cajon. That would be nice. 

When most cars die on you, they do 
so with emphasis and with real desire. 
Boom. That's it. You walk, sucker. 
Believe me, 'tis a far beller fate to have 
that happen than to have the car be 
indecisive about its own fate. It would 
be nice if the death occurred in a good 
location, though , which doesn't happen 
tOO often. 

So, buses suck and cars break down, . 
and most of us don't like it. I don't 
reaDy know what to conclude about this , 
or what to suggest in the future, other 
than maybe we should all take a clue 
from the Chinese and ride a bike to 
work or school every day-even if it 
means a 20-mile trek each way. But if 
anyone wants to trade an '85 Rabbit 
with a 78 Fiesta even up, let me 
know. ~ 

population. They assume that if they 
give a convincing enough argumem 
they'll go to one side or the other. It all 
goes back to that middle ground issue, 
that polarization. Do you think with the 
political views as they are, with Reagan 
in his second term, that the abonion 
amendment will keep surfacing, or do 
you think that is past? 
1.: I think that is past. They couldn't get 
it off the ground. What's the point of 
wasting political capital over someth'ing 
that won't fly? 
G: I thought maybe you'd gotten a 
glimmer of the (uture of the abortion 
debate in your research. I wonder if this 
will keep going or stay as it is? 
1.: 1 don't know. It remains to be seen:

In lase wuhend's game agamst Claremont. 

By CHRISTINA KAUS. 5/ajJ Wntet 
"I KNOW THIS I PREMATURE," 

said Jane Gnffith , player, coach 
of UCSD's women's lacrosse club, 

"but based on the way we played In the 
tournament last weekend, we could be 
one of the best tedms in California." 
This weekend's tournament In 
Claremont. where establIshed bcro se 
teams from Stanford and UC Berkeley 
Will also be competing, will be the 
deciding faclOr in detenninmg how 
good UCSD is. 

"Because they [Stanford and Call are 
already established teams, they have 
much stiffer competition. But I know we 
can beat them ," said Griffi th. "The way 
the girls played laSt weekend was 
amazing. They were really, really good. 
Our passing was incredible. And I 
swear. not one person dropped the 
ball! " 

The tournament to which Griffith IS 
referrIng was held at home last Saturday. 
The Truon first team defeated 
Claremont 12-0. "We played better than 
any team I've seen out here. Our 
defense shut them out!" exclaimed 
Gnfflth MVP for the tourndment (at 
least according to Griffith ) was Triton 
Kdren Bergan, a sophomore from lemon 
Grove . "She played really well 
defenSively," commented Gnffith. "It's 
hard ro believe she only learned how to 
play the game last year." She also ci ted 
the performances of freshma n Amy 
Mellencamp, sophomore Sloane Turner 
and Dana Compton as outstanding. 

Women's season gets underway 

Pool time for polo 
By DUNCAN MILLAR 

T HE WOMEN'S WATER POLO team opened Its season thiS past weekend with the UC Santa 
Barbam Gaucho Tournament in Isla 
ViSta , gaining two VlctOnes III four tries 

The Tritons defeated Stanford "B" 12-
5 and CSU Ha}'\vard 13-2, but fell to 
eventual champion Santa Barbara "K 9-
3 and California 7-4 III a tournament 
combming both open and I/ltercolleglare 
teams. 

"We were one of only a few trut' 
college teams In the tOurnament," UCSD 
coach Denny Harper said. Santa Barbara 
and Cal , according to Harper, each had 
several "non-collegiate all stars" 
(national-team-caliber players) on their 
side. Harper was encouraged that his 
squad played weU against these teams, 
which will be without their non-
collegiate players at the US Collegiate 
Nationals. The fact that the Tritons will 
play the whole season with the same 
group that played in Santa Barbara will 
be to their advantage when ationals 
come around . "Nationals (held May 10-
12 at Canyonview) will be great: Harper 
said 

tallIed nine goals, and Junior Kathaleen 
Layman, who added five . Goalie Jennifer 
Rennick had 25 saves for the weekend. 

lowe, a transfer from Modesto JC 
with seven years of club ball behind her, 
has emerged as one of the leaders of a 
team which lost its two tOp scorers from 
a year ago in Dldl Sleinhoff (who 
graduated) and Jenny Hohne (who 
transferred to UC 1r.' Ine). "I was a little 
disappointed ," lowe said, "when I first 
worked out with the team and saw how 
inexpenenced most of the players were. 
But I'm happy with the progress we've 
made. We've Improved drastically from 
day one." 

Harper noted that volleyball AII-
American Karin Kalk, who played water 
polo for the first time this weekend, has 
also contributed with some team 
guidance. "Her leadership as co-captain 
in volleyball has transferred to the pool," 
he noted , Kalk, a senior from Bishop, 
had three goals in the tournament. 

UCSD was were led in the 
tournament by jUfllor Janell lowe. who 

Harper was generally pleased with the 
weekend . He praised the play of a team 
which showed "good character for a 
group which has never played together 
b fore. Ihey Eil!!y care."lol about each 

..... --o."ther. They're not selfish , which will pay 

.. one of these girls ever played before 
last year or this year," Gnffith added. 

It was only last year that the lacrosse 
lub was formed . The team is not 

conSidered intercollegiate as of yet, bUl 
It hopes to be soon. "Going 
intercollegiate would make everything a 
lot easier. We would gel paid umpires, 
recruiting potential, everything which is 
considered intercollegiate ," Griffith said . 
As it stands now, the team depends on 
fund raising and must also teach the 
offtclals how 1O officiate games. "Some 
umpires tum out good , but we've had 
some experiences with rough teams and 
inexperienced umps where the game gOt 
out of control," said Griffith. 
Intercollegiate S[atus would also give the 
team a better field , five practice days 
and better competition . 

Griffith expects the men's lacrosse 
club to be admitted 1O the Intercollegiate 
Athletics Deparrment within the next 
two years, which means the women's 
club may soon follow. "Lacrosse is really 
growing. Stanford, Cal and UC Davis ali 
have established clubs. The next step 
would really be easy." 

Ot her statistics on Saturday'S 
lOurnament: Marney Blalre, three goals; 
Dana Compton, two assists, four goals, 
Marianne Danilovich, one assist, two 
goals; Amy Roger, two assists, one goal: 
and player/coach Jane Griffith, two 
goals. The Tritons have another 
tournament this weekend at 
Claremont. ~ 

off later on." He noted the good play of 
Junior Karin Givens, freshman Michelle 
Carroll (who scored four goals in just 
two games), sophomore Mary Bolic, and 
his goalie Rennick. 'Jennifer has . 
Improved tremendously from last year, 
Harper said . "I pulled her out of a swim 
class and lhrew her in the goal. She did 
OK then, but this year she Will be real 
tough ." 

Harper also took to Santa Barbara his 
Sunset San Diego women's water polo 
club , made up of UCSD grad uates, 
former players from San Diego Sta te 
(where Harper coached for a number of 
year;) and several current SDSU 
students. Both teams have been 
supportive of each olher. Additionally, 
the Sunset team has provided a source 
of experience and knowledge of water 
polo for UC D's squad. 

The Tritons look forward to the 
Triton/Sunset Invitational this Sarurday, 
which Will feature club teams from 
Commerce, long Beach, Newport Beach 
and Santa Barbara. UCSD Will face the 
Newport club at 9 am and Santa Barbard 
at 10:30. The second round and 
championsh!p-.games will be played in 
the afte rnoon. ~

The woes of a weekend golfer 

UCSD goIfen MiJIt O'Lall,2hlin (~) 
and Shtll Whttltr Cbtlow) sliow tilt stress 
wlaich CIIII COrrIt with a round of golf. 

By ROBERT HASWELL 

THERE IT WAS, just a week or so before me Masters, arguably golrs greatest [Qumament, as I stood 
around the Torrey Pines clubhouse . 
waiting for my tum to embark on a nine 
hole wim uxal disregard of me finer 
points of me grand game of golf. Most 
of me crowded mass of humanity 
around me (a common sight at Torrey. 
after 3 pm. when me rates go down) 
were waiting to do me same. Many of us 
would finish with a nine-hole score 
somewhere above 60, which would be 
pretty aood if we had played 18 holes, 
Some fuld it more rewarding to count 
lost baUs rather man strokes; the 

. number is usually lower. I personally 
count casualties. But as I approached 
the firs! tee of Torrey's North course . 
which most "experts" think is the easier 
of the two greens (how the hell can they 
tell-I' can't break 100 on either course), 
I was suddenly grabbed by a disturbing 
thought Why do people play thiS silly 
game? 

My tee shot hooked left inlO the trees. 
I blamed it on my recent revelation . I 
then teed up a "mulligan" which fared 
slightly better. landing just off me 
fairway in some low weeds, The rest of 
my foursome took meir tee shots and 
we were off to the races. With each shot 
my mind became more obsessed ~ 
me poindessness of It all. Why IS It my 
nine iron approach shot to me green 
resembles a Tony Gwynn line drive, 
twiSdng and cwving down me right 

field line, rather than a beautiful. 
soaring, Tom WalSOn-ish nine iron that 
hits the green, sucks back twO feet from 
all me backspin, and leaves a five-foot 
putt? I stn@ed for an answer. 

On lV, ine pros make it look so easy, 
Watch any pro on lV, and what you 
will see is a smooth yet thunderous tee 
shot that disappears into a golden 
sunset, and putts that seem [Q drop 
from everywhere on me green. But m.ore 
imponant is the fact that mey make It 
look so easy! Anyone could do that with 
practice, right? HeD, the ball doesn't 
even move! 

Still. I couldn'td'ustify to m~lf why 
the "weekend go er" insists on ruining 
his weekend wim a round of golf. Some 
players take a less serious approach to 
the game. They rent a catt, buy a case of 
beer and weave down the fairways , 
laughing, cursing, taunting their 
pattners, and eventuaDy shooting a 117. 
Many of us simply use an age-old 
technique that gives some temporary 
relief to our sanity. We cheat. We 
merrily stroll down the course, 
improving our lies, replacing lost balls 
unbeknownst to our pattners, and 
endlessly slashing strokes off our 
score-a practice reminiscent of the 
chefs at Beni Hana. I mean, who really 
knows the difference between a 
quadruple bogey and a triple bogey? 

But through it aD, we trudge on. An 
occasional par rekindles the 
disappearing motivation to complete the 

round. But that cannot possibly be 
reason enough for some of the 
masochism rve seen on a golf course. In 
fact, I recendy played with a gendeman 
who, when he approached the first tee , 
was a cool, confident La Jolla 
businessman, ready to beat the world. 
When we had completed just nine holes 
(and had lost some seven balls), he was 
reduced 1O a mumbling, twitc~ing shell 
of a man. so utterly beaten that I 
thought the game had surely won, Less 
than a week later, there he was again, 
on the first tee smiling and ready to 
play. It boggles the mind. . 

While I walked down the laSt fairway 
after a decent round for me (I was 
denied shooting bogey golf only by 
three-putting the final green), I 
discovered the reason for this madness: 
Golf is the sporr version of marriage. A 
fine shot or a good hole can make up 
for a lousy round, Each institution has 
its ups and downs, yet they both 
endure. In our effon to make it work, to 
finaDy have fun at golf (or at marriage, 
for that matter), we take our figurative 
lumps and bruises (and our deflated 
egos) home at the end of the day, put 
them in the closet and forget about 
them. One week later all we remember 
is the good time we had. Most are ready 
to rerum to the course and "chase those 
birdies" before the next sunny day, 

If that explanation doesn't satisfy you, 
just kid yourself that a round of golf is

The poetry of agony and fWomen' 
By DANIEL THOMAS 

The Suzuki Company of Toga, 
Japan, treated UCSD to its 
performances of The Trojan Women 
this past weekend at the Mandell 
Weiss Theater, The entire play was 
presented in Japanese, but even 
though the majority of the 'audience 
could not understand the language, 
they seemed nonetheless deeply 
moved and astounded by the work. 

In what we might call a process of 
artistic fusion, Tadashi Suzuki has 
worked the play from its ancient . 
form into a modern Japanese piece. 
To achieve this, he has relied on the 
traditions of classical Japanese Noh 
and Kabuki theater, as well as using 
his own poetic and directorial 
talents. In the process, a new version 
of The Trojan Women has been 
created. The characters of Hecuba 
and Cassandra are brought together 
as one, "the old woman," played so 
eloquently by the great actress 
Kayoko Shiraishi, who has been 
working with Suzuki for over 18 
years. 

In the Suzuki play, the Greek 
tragedy is contained within a 
specifically Japanese story, namely, a 
tale of an old woman who lost her 
husband, sons and daughters in 
World War II. Suzuki's notes in the 
program state, "Using Euripedes' 
work as a starting point, I staged a 
situation in which an old woman 
who has been driven from her gutted 
home lives through the legends of 
Troy in her fantasy." 

The Trojan Women is really about 
all women who are victims of war. 
The program further states, "The 
objective of this production is to 
create the tragic character of a 
woman in which are summed up the 
infinite sufferings brought by war to 
the innocent wives of the defeated 
warriors. " 

Shiraishi and her partners in the 
company gave a magnificent 
performance, at times bringing tears 
to the audience, at other times 
leaving them dumbfounded in awe, 
in spite of the audience's ignorance 
of the dialogue. How could this be? It 
was by the power of their movement, 
and the true, inner life of the play. 
The actors were all realizing this life 
and showing it through their every 
movement, even through their 
complete stillness. 

Kayolc.o Slairailhi CIa II _ rllWlled by war in "The Trojan Womm." 

At the end of the performance, by 
way of curtain call, the enti re cast 
marched several times around the 
stage, demonstrating a variety of 
steps in the "Suzuki method ." This 
method teaches actors and actresses 
how to "make the whole body speak, 
even when one keeps silent." In 
developing this method, Tadashi 
Suzuki drew inspiration from 
classical Japanese theater and 
philosophy. He aims to reach the 
balance between heaven and earth, as 
symbolized by the human body 
itself, with its upper and lower parts 
joined at the pelvis. 

To understand this, consider the 

scene of the mutilation and death of 
the baby which was especially 
effective and horrifying, even though 
the baby was only a little cloth 
dummy. The players knew what it 
was-the royal child ofT roy. One of 
the soldiers sliced off its arm, while 
another raped the mother, 
Andromache. The malicious power

of the soldiers, the terror of the 
mother and the agony of the old 
woman (Hecuba) were something 
more than mere words could tell. 
The agony was beautifully expressed 
in the twisting form and the 
powerful voice of Shiraishi, the old 
woman, as she wrapped the body of 
her dead grandchild for burial. . 

Suzuki has been teaching his 
method at several universities in the

to be hoped that he may return here

The reggae beat is 
tBurning' bright here 

By CHRIS YOUNG 
Winston Rodney is the heart and 

soul of Burning Spear, just as reggae 
is the musical heartbeat of an African 
past. While we skank to the rhythms 
and rock to the beat, Winston will be 
filling the La Paloma Theater tonight 
with his philosophy of universal 
love. 

The group Burning Spear was 
formed in 1968, taking its name 
from the "Burning Spear" of Kenya, 
freedom fighter Jomo Kenyatta. 
Fifteen albums have followed since 
then, among them the well known 
Marcus Garvey, Fittest of the Fittest, 
and the recently~released Resistance. 

Burning Spear, as Rodney is 
known, has been much acclaimed as 
a brilliant singer and songwriter. 
Known for his unique style, easily 
recognizable in all his works, 
Winston is a symbol of his age. His 
music rises out of Black pride and a 
cultural awareness of the struggles of 
Blacks everywhere to overcome the 
lasting stigma of slavery and white 
oppression. The songs of Burning 
Spear are among the most 
compelling, and politically inspiring, 
in reggae music today. 

In concert Rodney is backed up by 
the Burning Band, featuring one of 
ja maica 's best trumpet and 

fluglehorn players, Bobby Ellis. 
These dynamic performers can 
transplant a crowd to jamaica's sun~ 
baked shores, to sway and' sweat, 
hypnotized by their African, 
chanting style. 

Opening the concert will be the 
Kushite Raiders, a rock and reggae 
band from Los Angeles, who 
combine their modern social 
comments with the age old rhythms 
of Africa and jamaica. The Raiders 
put on a tremendous show, mixing it 
up with rock and reggae tunes, 
religious and political statements. 

The doors to the theater open at 
eight, but to go in you must have a 
ticket. This will cost you $10.50 in 
advance or $11.50 at the door. 
Advance tickets are probably a good 
idea. .. 

* * * This must be a good month for 
reggae in San Diego because, just 
when you've had time to cool down 
from the Burning Spear concert, the 
Itals, the Roots Radics and Don 
Carlos will roll into town. Saturday, 
April 20, all three bands will come to 
the La Paloma Theater as part three 
of Prophet Productions' Spring All~ 
Star Reggae Review. 

The !tals have been solid in the
